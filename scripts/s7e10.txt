12 INT. BUFFY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Someone's sweeping up broken glass from the floor. Pan up to show it's Xander. He stops and addresses the room. Buffy's doing research at the dining room table, sitting next to Willow who is using her laptop computer. Anya and Dawn are on the couch in the living room looking through books.

XANDER

(exasperated) It's a loop...like the Mummy Hand. I'm doomed to replace these windows for all eternity. You know, maybe we should just board these up until things are less hellmouthy.

ANYA

(holds up a notebook she was reading) Nothing...and nothing. (holds up two other books, one in each hand) Cliff Notes to nothing. Nothing abridged...

WILLOW

(looks up from her computer) Yeah, my search isn't turning anything up either. (to Buffy) Are you sure this thing called itself The First?

BUFFY

Pretty sure. It claimed to be the original evil, the one that came before anything else.

ANYA

(looking up over her reading glasses) Please, how many times have I heard that line in my demon days? "I'm so rotten, they don't even have a word for it. I'm bad. Baddy bad bad bad. Does it make you horny?" (everyone stares at her) Or terrified. Whatever.

BUFFY

It wasn't a line. When I came up against this thing, I felt it. It was ancient and enormous. It nearly got Angel to kill himself. And if we don't rescue Spike soon, God only knows what the First'll get him to do.

XANDER

(looks over at Andrew, who's passed out, tied to a chair) I wish Sleeping Ugly would come to. He's been out all night.

ANYA

Yes, he was just starting to squeal when the spooky SWAT attacked. Said The First was held up at the Seal of...Danzar something?

DAWN

(stands, walks to Andrew) Hmm. Maybe he's just faking so he doesn't have to answer any more questions. (punches him in the face, stands back to observe) Hm. Or maybe he's in a fugue state.(rears back to punch him again, but Buffy interrupts)

BUFFY

Dawn.

DAWN

What?

BUFFY

He'll come to when he comes to. Keep reading. If we're gonna rescue Spike, we need to figure out how to fight this thing.

DAWN

(pouts, goes back to the couch) Anya gets to hit him.

WILLOW

Hey! Here, The First!...Bank of Delaware. Sorry.

BUFFY

(sighs) Hand me the Watchers' Codex again. (someone hands her an old-looking book)

JOYCE

Can I get you anything else, baby? (Buffy recognizes the voice and turns to look) How 'bout some tea?

BUFFY

(searching her, shocked) Mom? (sighs, closes eyes) You're not real.

JOYCE

(bends to Buffy's eye level) OK, is that, uh, slang, like you're not for real, or—?

BUFFY

(looks her in the eyes) You're The First.

JOYCE

Oh, baby, you're so tired, you're not making sense. Maybe you should get some sleep.

BUFFY

No.

JOYCE

You can't win against this thing. Not if you don't rest.

BUFFY

(visibly shaken) Stop. Stop being like this. It's a lie.

JOYCE

I don't want to scare you, but I want you to take care. (slowly) You need to wake up.

BUFFY

What?

XANDER (O.S.)

You're dreaming. Buff, wake up.

BUFFY

(having fallen asleep at the dining room table, she wakes) Hm? Did you see it? (looks around)

XANDER

There's nothing to see. You were just doing a little dream talking, that's all.

BUFFY

Oh.

XANDER

You OK? What'd you see?

BUFFY

(shakes head) Nothing. It was nothing.

Cut to:

13 INT. UNDERGROUND CAVE - NIGHT

In the background, chanting in Latin can be heard. Spike is being dragged, face up, along the dirt ground. His chest wounds have started to close, but the symbols cut into him remain clear on his chest. Spike looks around, a little disoriented, and sees Harbingers with torches and someone dragging him. It's the UberVamp dragging Spike into a special room. The UberVamp stops, lets go of Spike's leg, and stares at him. Spike/First walks into the room.

FIRST [SPIKE]

Go on. Give it a kick then. You always liked that, didn't you?

Spike/First morphs into Drusilla's form.

FIRST [DRUSILLA]

Kick a dolly when he's down. That was always your style.

Drusilla/First kneels to watch UberVamp kick Spike in the ribs so hard he rolls over. Spike lifts his head to glare angrily at the UberVamp. The UberVamp hisses and growls at Spike.

FIRST [DRUSILLA]

Has buckets of energy, poor dear. He's been laying in wait for his moment since before the bug walked. (stands, walks to UberVamp) There, there, pet. (clicks tongue) Soon as the moon comes, you'll have your carnage. (looks at Spike) Little girls tear so easily, like pink paper. 'Til then, we'll have our way with this one. Got it coming, he does. (hums)

The UberVamp goes back to Spike, kicking him. Spike screams.

Fade to black.

*** ACT I ***

14 INT. BUFFY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Show Andrew, still passed out and tied to a chair in the living room. Someone splashes water in his face. He shudders a little, but doesn't regain consciousness. Show Dawn and Anya standing there looking at him. Anya's got a cup in her hand.

ANYA

That was something.

DAWN

(to Anya) Maybe if you threw hot water on him.

ANYA

Good thinking.

Dawn and Anya walk toward the kitchen, but Buffy comes into the room, so they go sit on the couch instead.

ANYA

Whoa, hey.

DAWN

Hi. (Buffy stares at them, but they avoid eye contact) Nothing.

BUFFY

What?

DAWN

(wringing hands) Oh, um, I thought you were gonna ask us what we were doing.

BUFFY

No, was going to ask—

DAWN

(Andrew coughs) Oh! Look who's awake. (stands and goes to Andrew)

ANYA

(follows Dawn) Silly Andrew, (slaps his chin gently) you drooled all over yourself.

ANDREW

(to Buffy) I'm—I was about to be dead. You saved me.

BUFFY

(steps up between Dawn and Anya) For the time being. (crosses arms) But if you don't tell us what we need to know, then I'm gonna offer you to The First on a platter and let him chop you into tiny pieces.

ANDREW

The first what?

ANYA

The name of the evil thing that pretended to be Warren to get you to kill Jonathan.

ANDREW

Oh, not very ominous sounding.

DAWN

No, i-it is if you understand the context.

ANDREW

No, an evil name should be like Lex or Voldemort or—

BUFFY

Hey, I was intimidating here. (flanking Buffy, Dawn and Anya turn and glare at Andrew)

ANDREW

Oh, sorry. Um, go ahead.

BUFFY

(sighs) Forget it. Where's the seal?

Cut to:

15 INT. BASEMENT AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

Buffy, Dawn and Xander are following Andrew through the school basement.

ANDREW

It's around this corner, I think.

BUFFY

You better be right this time.

ANDREW

I told you—I'm not sure.

Cut to:

16 INT. SEAL OF DANTHAZAR ROOM IN BASEMENT AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

Andrew leads Buffy, Dawn, and Xander to the room where he killed Jonathan.

XANDER

Maybe you should get sure. I'm sick of all the runaround with you— (sees the seal of Danthazar) Whoa. Check out the goat-heady badness.

BUFFY

What's it do?

ANDREW

I don't know. Something not good. It didn't work 'cause... there wasn't enough blood. (turns to leave) OK. (Buffy stops him)

DAWN

(investigating the wheel they hung Spike from last episode) There's blood on this. Lots. (turns to Buffy) Looks like the first made another sacrifice. Or a music video.

BUFFY

The seal could've been activated. I bet that's what the First needed Spike for.

ANDREW

(panics) That wasn't there before. I had nothing to do with that.

XANDER

Thanks for clearing that up 'cause otherwise we might've thought you were up to no good here at the satanic manhole cover. You killed your best friend!

ANDREW

(softly) He's in a place of joy and peace. He told me. (Buffy rolls her eyes)

XANDER

No, nobody told you. You got tricked by a fake ghost.

BUFFY

Boys, can we save the encounter session? We need to cover this thing up. (grabs nearby shovels, hands them out) Whatever it does, we can't leave it exposed like this.

They start shoveling dirt over the seal.

Cut to:

17 INT. BASEMENT AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

After covering up the seal, Xander and Andrew walk out of the Seal of Danthazar room and into the hallway, followed by Buffy and Dawn.

ANDREW

Man, this place gives me the creeps. It's like in Wonder Woman, issue 297/299—

XANDER

"Catacombs"—yeah with the skeletons.

ANDREW & XANDER

(simultaneously, smiling and nodding) That was cool.

XANDER

(suddenly frowns and pushes Andrew) Move it. This way.

DAWN

So what next? We found the seal, but no Spike.

BUFFY

(sighs) I don't know. The first was camped underground last time I found him, but—

Principal Wood passes them in the basement hallway, carrying a shovel, looking a little disheveled.

PRINCIPAL

Buffy?

BUFFY

(turns to face him) Hey.

PRINCIPAL

Hey. I—thought that you were, um—

DAWN

Sick? She was. Oh, vomiting and oozing from various places and—

PRINCIPAL

Yeah, I remember, so please don't go on.

DAWN

Oh, but now, it's amazing. The doctor gave her some cream.

BUFFY

(overlapping with Dawn) Pills. (Principal looks back and forth between them) And a cream. And I'm all better. (stares at the Principal's shovel)

PRINCIPAL

Oh, yeah, um, apparently somebody left this in the courtyard, and I was just returning it.

BUFFY

That's some full-service principaling.

PRINCIPAL

I try.

BUFFY

(looks at her own shovel) Oh, I was down here helping Dawn with a school project.

DAWN

For science.

BUFFY

We buried a, um, uh, time capsule.

DAWN

Hello people of the future. Kids of today like Red Bull and, uh, Jackass. (laughs nervously)

BUFFY

We better go. (Buffy and Dawn turn to leave)

PRINCIPAL

Buffy? (Buffy turns back to face him) You know if you are feeling better, I could really use you back at work. I've been wait listing kids who really want to see you.

BUFFY

Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, I'm sorry, you know, I was just—I've been ill and stuff.

PRINCIPAL

No, no, it's fine, and I understand. It's just things are starting to back up.

BUFFY

Well I-I-I'll be there tomorrow. No problem. 100% ooze free.

PRINCIPAL

Good.

BUFFY

OK.

Buffy and Dawn walk away one direction and Principal Wood walks away in the other direction. Buffy turns to look at him quizzically, then turns back. Then Principal Wood turns to look at Buffy, twirling his shovel as he walks away.

Cut to:

18 INT. DINING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

Anya brings in a candle and sets it on the dining room table in front of Willow. Willow strikes a match to light the various candles in front of her. Dawn's at the other end of the table using Willow's laptop computer. Buffy and Xander are standing at the end of the room, near the foyer, watching the goings on.

XANDER

(to Buffy) How's it going?

BUFFY

Dawn's trying to find out anything she can about the Seal of Danzalthar. Will's about to do a locator spell, see if we can find The First. (yawns)

XANDER

Why don't you go get some rest. You haven't slept for like two days. We'll call you if we find anything.

BUFFY

Nah, I-I couldn't sleep. Too much going on.

XANDER

It'll be OK, Buff. We've faced this kind of stuff before.

Willow pours a sandy mixture on the table in front of her.

BUFFY

You didn't see The First. I did. I felt it. It was like—

A magical explosion sends Anya back against the wall in the corner. The bowl in front of Willow glows red. Dawn shrieks and jumps back from the table, crawling away to hide. The red light surrounds Willow then enters her body through her nostrils. She throws her head back and a demonic apparition (huge, with two horns on its head and glowy red eyes) escapes her mouth, lunging toward Buffy.

BUFFY

Will!

The demon goes back inside Willow, and she stands, sending red lightning bolts from her mouth. The bolts are aimed at Buffy, knocking her down and sending her across the floor on her back into the foyer.

WILLOW

(in a deep possessed voice) You only make me stronger!

Xander grabs the glowing bowl from the spell, and throws it against the dining room wall, shattering it. The light disappears, and Willow collapses, crying and twitching. Xander goes to check on Anya. Buffy kneels at Willow's side, holding her head.

BUFFY

Will!

WILLOW

It's still in me. I feel it!

BUFFY

No, it's not. It's gone. You're OK.

WILLOW

I don't want to hurt anybody. Please, Buffy, don't let it make me. Oh, God!

BUFFY

We won't. I promise, OK? I promise. We won't use magic to fight this thing until we know what we're doing.

WILLOW

I can't. I can't. I'm sorry.

Cut to:

19 INT. LIVING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

Willow's standing off to the side of the room. Anya and Dawn are sitting on the couch. Buffy's got her coat on, ready to leave. Xander's discussing the plan with her.

XANDER

At least let me come with you.

BUFFY

(walks to foyer) I'm going alone.

XANDER

You said yourself, you don't know how to fight The First, or even where it is.

BUFFY

(sighs) It's out there. It's hurting my friends. I'll find it.

Buffy opens the front door to leave, but sees Giles standing there on her front porch when she opens it.

GILES

Buffy.

BUFFY

Giles.

Buffy goes to hug Giles, but is cut off when three girls she's never met walk right into her house.

GIRL #1

(in a Cockney British accent) Nice place. Bit of a mess. (walks inside the house)

Girl #2 walks by Buffy and smiles, but says nothing.

GIRL #3

(looks at Buffy) This is a slayer? (looks away and sighs on her way inside the house)

Buffy stares at the girls, then looks at Giles, confused.

GILES

Sorry to barge in. We have a slight apocalypse.

Fade to black.

*** ACT II ***

20 INT. LIVING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

Dawn's standing in front of the three girls Giles brought with him. The three girls are lined up against the wall, and Dawn's inspecting them, arms crossed in front of her.

DAWN

They're all slayers?

GILES

Potential slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like them all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful, and they're all on their way to Sunnydale.

BUFFY

The others were murdered.

20a EXT. CITY STREET IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY - NIGHT

A dark-haired girl is held down by two hooded figures, and a third figure raises an arched, shiny, silver dagger and thrusts down at her.

20b INT. PARKING GARAGE IN FRANKFURT, GERMANY - NIGHT

A girl with hot pink hair with black bangs at her forehead, a nose ring, and a metal collar is trying to escape her pursuers. Robed men close the door behind them and start to fight with her. She is knocked to the ground, lying on her back. Finally, one of the robed people pulls out a curved silver dagger and stabs her.

GILES

In cold blood. As well as their watchers. We always feared that this day would come, when there'd be an attack against not just an individual slayer, but against the whole line.

20c INT. FLAT IN ENGLAND - DAY

Giles enters the flat, looking around. He sees Robson lying injured on the floor and goes to his side.

ROBSON

(eyes flash open) It's started.

BUFFY

The First. That's what it wants.

GILES

Yes, to erase all the slayers in training and their watchers along with their methods.

BUFFY

And then Faith, and then me. And with all the potentials gone and no way of making another, it's the end. No more slayer. Ever.

WILLOW

But we haven't found any information on The First. No documentation—

GILES

(crosses arms) That's because it predates any written history, and it rarely shows its true face. The only record I know was in the Council Library.

ANYA

What about the Council? What do they say about this?

GILES

Gone. (looks at Buffy, who stares back in shock)

WILLOW

What?

GILES

Obliterated. They were in session, and, uh, there was an explosion.

WILLOW

That means all the Council's records are-are destroyed?

GILES

Annabelle. (Girl #2 unzips her book bag, takes two books and a stack of files from it and lays them on the coffee table in front of Willow) That's what's left. (Willow, Anya, Dawn and Buffy each take some of the new material and peruse it) The mystic secrets of the Watchers. And whatever I could find on The First. When I learned what was happening, I-I, um, I stole them.

ANYA

And you blew the Council up! See, this is what happens when you're all stuffy and repressed. You overreact.

GILES

Not—I didn't. Must've been an agent of The First, after my little burglary session. The knowledge contained in these files had to be protected, and there wasn't time for-for bureaucracy or debate. The Council knows no other way.

ANDREW

(still tied to a chair, he lets out a melodramatic observation) And it cost them their lives! (everyone turns and stares, he sits back) Go on.

BUFFY

(to Xander) Can we gag him? (Xander claps and goes to Andrew, putting duct tape over his mouth) But what do these records say about The First?

GILES

Uh, very little. It can change form. Uh, it only appears in the guise of someone who's passed away.

WILLOW

Our ghosts.

GILES

Also it's not corporeal. It can't touch or fight on it's own. It only works through those it manipulates. And its followers, the Bringers.

GIRL #3

Those freaks in the black robes.

GIRL #1

Yeah, with the hoodies and the crazy alphabet eyes. I never saw 'em, I just heard—

ANNABELLE

Shh! Molly, Mr. Giles doesn't need us prattling on.

GILES

(sits on arm of couch) The First is unlike anything we've faced before. I mean, there's evil and then there's the thing that created evil, the source.

BUFFY

And that's what this thing claims to be?

GILES

That's what it is. It has eternities to act, endless resources. (stands) How to defeat it—I-I— (sighs) honestly I don't know. But we have to find a way. If the slayer line is eliminated, then the hell mouth has no guardian. The balance is destroyed. (walks up to Buffy) I'm afraid it falls to you, Buffy. Sorry. I mean, we'll do what we can, but you're the only one who has the strength to protect these girls—and the world—against what's coming.

XANDER

But no pressure.

GIRL #3

(walks to the center of the room, addressing everyone) That's it? That's the plan? I don't see how one person, even a slayer, could protect us. I saw what those bringer guys can do. They tore apart my watcher.

GILES

Of course we'll use all our resources—

GIRL #3

And if this thing is the root of all evil, isn't the hell mouth it's number one vacation spot? I mean, don't you think we should be hiding our asses on the other side of the globe?

ANNABELLE

Kennedy!

BUFFY

No, she's not wrong. We need more muscle. That's why we need to find Spike.

ANYA

Yeah, he'll help. You know, if he's not crazy or off killing people or dead. Or, you know, all of the above.

Cut to:

21 INT. UNDERGROUND CAVE - DAY

Spike's head is thrust underwater, and he struggles under the force of hands that are holding him down. Pan out to show that it's the UberVamp holding Spike's head in a pool of water in the cave. Drusilla/First is pacing behind them, supervising. Finally, Spike stops struggling, and the UberVamp pulls Spike's head out of the pool and throws him on the ground.

FIRST [DRUSILLA]

That's why our kind make such good dollies.

Lying face up on the ground, Spike coughs out water. He looks away from Drusilla/First.

FIRST [DRUSILLA]

Hard to kill. Tried to enlighten little Buffy, didn't you? Spilled, spilled, spilled our secrets like seed. (reaches down to touch her dress at thigh level, slowly starts pulling up her skirt) But you forgot, I say what you tell and what you know. I say when this is over. (lets go of her skirt and puts her hands behind her head) And I'm not done with you yet. Not nearly. (clicks tongue)

On Drusilla/First's command, the UberVamp picks up Spike and heads for the pool, forcing his head underwater again.

Cut to:

22 EXT. SUNNYDALE STREET - NIGHT

Zoom in on a holiday display in a storefront window. Pan over to Buffy and Giles walking side by side down the street.

GILES

This place you originally saw The First—you say it was in a Christmas tree lot?

BUFFY

Under it. There was a hidden cavern. Just happened to be under a tree lot. The Bringers were doing some kind of ritual. (looks at Giles) Giles, this is bad, isn't it? A new kind of bad.

GILES

Just in time for Christmas.

BUFFY

(sighs, looks around) You know, I didn't even realize it was December. Maybe when we get home, we should decorate the rubble. (looks at Giles) Think you'll ever show up for a real visit? The kind where the world isn't about to end?

GILES

If we survive this, I promise.

BUFFY

Good. 'Cause I miss you.

GILES

I miss you too.

Cut to:

23 INT. LIVING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

Andrew is still tied to the chair, talking to Xander.

ANDREW

So, how long have you followed Buffy?

XANDER

I don't follow her. She's my best friend.

ANDREW

Huh. She seems like a good leader. Her hair is shiny. Does she make you stab things?

Willow, who's putting a pillow and blanket on the couch, is talking to Kennedy. She grabs a stack of bed sheets and starts walking toward the staircase.

WILLOW

OK, so Annabelle can sleep down here, uh, Molly can sleep in Dawn's room—

KENNEDY

Not if Dawn actually wants to sleep. Molly'll talk her ear off.

WILLOW

OK, then Molly down here, you with Dawn, and Annabelle in my room.

KENNEDY

Bad idea. Annabelle snores.

WILLOW

(hands sheets to Kennedy) You wanna do the sleeping arrangements?

KENNEDY

(starts up the stairs) OK. (turns to face Willow) You, uh, better not hog the covers. (smiles, turns to go upstairs)

Willow eyes widen.

DAWN

(walks up to Willow from the kitchen) Does she want to eat?

WILLOW

What? Huh? Oh, she's—Oh, she's new. (glances up the stairs after Kennedy)

DAWN

(walks back to the kitchen, Willow follows) Well, Annabelle and Molly are starved and I totally burnt the mac and cheese. Oh, um, I'll put hot sauce on it, tell 'em it's an American thing, say it's blackened.

24 INT. KITCHEN AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

Anya is scraping the burnt mac and cheese out of the pot and into the garbage can.

ANYA

Actually, it's not blackened so much as ruined.

WILLOW

Or we can order pizza.

ANNABELLE

(sitting at the island, reading a book) As long as it's plain. I'm veggie.

MOLLY

(going through the cabinets, opening a box of cereal) Cracked, you mean.

ANNABELLE

Just because you'll eat any kind of trash—

MOLLY

(finds boxes of cookies on the counter) Brill! Biscuits! You don't mind do you? I got a case of the nerves after Mr. Giles lecture.

DAWN

(opens a box of cookies) Knock yourself out. I feel a cookie problem coming on, myself.

Dawn and Annabelle get into one box of cookies, and Willow and Molly share another while Anya mumbles in the background.

Cut to:

25 EXT. CHRISTMAS TREE SALES LOT - NIGHT

Buffy and Giles walk into the empty Christmas tree lot. Lights are strung, but there are no trees there. The two of them are looking around.

GILES

So the entrance to the cave was above ground here?

BUFFY

Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was around here somewhere.

GILES

Well, we'll just keep—

BUFFY (O.S.)

(crunch of breaking wood can be heard) Aah! (Giles turns to look) Found it!

Buffy has fallen into a hole in the ground that was covered with wooden slats that apparently gave way. Giles puts his glasses on and bends to look into the hole.

GILES

Good lord, are you all right?

Cut to:

26 INT. UNDERGROUND CAVE - NIGHT

Buffy has fallen into a cave and landed on top of some rubble. She stands and dusts herself off while talking to Giles, who is still above ground.

BUFFY

Peachy, except my knees bend backwards now. OK, Giles, stay up there. I'm gonna check it out.

Buffy walks off further into the cave.

GILES

Right. (stands and looks around the empty lot above ground)

Buffy walks around among the various cave formations. She looks up, she looks down, and then something passes behind Buffy, unseen by her. She turns to look, but no one is behind her. When she turns back, the UberVamp hisses in her face. Buffy is startled, and the UberVamp takes that opportunity to punch her so hard she flies across the room, landing against the wall and falling to the ground. He kicks and punches her with such force that her blocks are mostly ineffective.

She retreats, but he follows. Finally she gets some good offensive moves in, but he's able to avoid or block more than half of them. He punches her again, sending her rolling into another room. She gets to her feet before the UberVamp can get to her and readies herself with a stake. When he finally comes close enough, she stakes him right through the heart. He looks at the stake, growls, looks at Buffy, and takes out the stake. Buffy's eyes grow wide as she stares in utter shock.

Fade to black.

*** ACT III ***

27 INT. UNDERGROUND CAVE - NIGHT

Resume. Buffy's staring at the UberVamp.

The UberVamp punches Buffy and comes after her with her own stake. Buffy avoids his attacks, but her back's literally against the wall. Her eyes are still wide as she watches him come after her. He punches her in the stomach and throws her against the wall. She throws a punch at him, but he catches her fist in his palm and squeezes until it makes crunching sounds, then twists her arm, then pulls her body by the arm until he slams her head into a stalagmite, before finally grabbing her throat, squeezing, and lifting her off the ground. Buffy winces and looks around desperately until she finds a stalactite. She breaks the stalactite off of the cave ceiling and bashes the UberVamp's head with it. He drops her and falls to the ground.

While he's recovering, Buffy makes a run for it. She climbs the cave walls toward the hole where she fell in. She's almost out, her hands are on the Christmas tree lot ground, when the UberVamp grabs her heel. Buffy struggles against him, trying to get out of the hole, but the UberVamp pulls her back in. There's nothing on the ground for her to grab on to to resist. She kicks the UberVamp in the head and tries again to crawl out of the hole. She barely gets out of the hole and looks up at Giles, who is backlit by the rising sun, which he blocks. The UberVamp starts to crawl out of the hole, but sees the sunlight, and retreats back into it.

Cut to:

28 INT. KITCHEN AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

Buffy and Giles walk into the kitchen through the back door, only to see the three slayers in training already up and eating breakfast.

BUFFY

(to Giles)...the others just yet. It'll give us a chance to— (sees the girls in the kitchen)

KENNEDY

(eating a bowl of cereal) Sorry about the British invasion.

MOLLY

(preparing toast and jelly) We've been up for hours.

ANNABELLE

(drinking from a mug) 4 P.M. London time.

KENNEDY

Are you all right? You look...

BUFFY

(shuts the door) Oh. Yeah, I'm OK. I just got into a fight is all. (to Giles) You want to tell me with what? (takes off her coat)

GILES

Yes, Buffy, but don't you think we should, uh, discuss this privately?

BUFFY

You mean, not in front of the next generation? No time to coddle them, Giles. Welcome to the war room, guys.

Annabelle gets out a notepad to take notes.

GILES

Uh, what you fought was a vampire, but it was, um, something more than that. It was a Turok-Han. As Neanderthals are to human beings, the Turok-Han are to vampires. Primordial, ferociously powerful killing machines, as single-minded as animals. They are the vampires that vampires fear. An ancient and entirely different race and, until this morning, I thought they were a myth.

BUFFY

So, The First shows up, and now this? You think it's a coincidence?

GILES

I think it's more likely that the Turok-Han is here as an agent of The First.

ANNABELLE

Um, did you slay it?

BUFFY

No, it's still out there, somewhere.

MOLLY

What's it want?

BUFFY

All of us dead. But for now it looks like sunlight is keeping this UberVamp away.

GILES

So, until sunset, I suggest you get some rest. A few hours sleep will do a world of difference.

BUFFY

No sleep today. Can't.

GILES

Oh, come on, you're exhausted.

BUFFY

Ah, it comes with the gig. Somehow I don't think taking on prehistoric evil comes with nap time. Sorry, potential guys. I know you came a long way, and you wanna get into it, but the best thing you can do right now is just sit tight, wait it out. I'm gonna go to work, see what I can find out. I'll be back before sunset.

GILES

How do you plan to research something as ill-defined as The First?

BUFFY

I have the best plan ever.

29 INT. BUFFY'S CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

Buffy is sitting at her desk, talking on the phone, using her computer. Beside her keyboard is a large gourmet coffee. She has a web browser up, and is using a search engine. In the search field, she has typed "evil".

BUFFY

(to phone) Yeah, well, I already re-checked the basement. (beat) Wait, you know, hold on, I'm gonna try something. (types, sighs) Maybe The First isn't ready for modern technology. Displaying results 1 through 10 of 900,517. OK, I gotta narrow this down. I'll call you back? Yeah. (Buffy hangs up then types)

PRINCIPAL

(walks up to her cubicle wall without her noticing, reading from her computer screen) Manifestations of evil? (Buffy types more in the search field, Principal reads what she's typing) In... the... movies. (to Buffy) You're searching for evil movies?

BUFFY

Uh, I know it's not the all-time most kosher use of my office hours, um, but, you know, looking at some down time. And what can I say, I just love those evil, evil movies. Like Exorcist, you know, Blair Witch...

PRINCIPAL

Hmm. As opposed to Rob Schneider's Oeuvre.

BUFFY

Different kind of evil.

PRINCIPAL

Yeah. (walks into her cubicle) Buffy, you know, I'm not that big a fan of scary movies, even the hokie ones. Sometimes they go to a place that I think kids could stand to avoid. (sits in the chair in front of her desk, crosses his arms and leans forward on her desk)

BUFFY

Well, it's not for the kids.

PRINCIPAL

(looking her right in the eyes) Yeah, yeah, I'm only saying that once you see true evil, it can have some serious after burn, and then you can't unsee what you saw. Ever. That's just one opinion. I better get back to work. (stands and walks out of her cubicle)

BUFFY

(calls after him) What kind of movies do you like?

PRINCIPAL

(pauses, answers without turning around) Oh, me? Mysteries. I love finding out what's underneath it all at the very end. (grins)

Cut to:

30 INT. UNDERGROUND CAVE - DAY

Spike is propped up on a rock, looking beaten and haggard. One of his eyes is swollen shut. He lies there as Drusilla/First stand in front of him talking.

FIRST [DRUSILLA]

Think of it as a game. A fun, funny game. Without all the rules, or any of the bothersome winning part. But still, there are sides. You have to choose a side, Spike. Then we can fly—be free and visit all our friends as they come squirming up from out the earth. (starts dancing) I know you like a good wriggle and a giggle and a squiggle.

SPIKE

You're not Drusilla.

FIRST [DRUSILLA]

(giggles) No, I'm really not.

SPIKE

She was crazier than you.

FIRST [DRUSILLA]

(covers her ears with her hands) Ooh, daddy. No kicking. It's almost Christmas day today and you've gone spoiling it. I've been so very good all year. (growls playfully in Spike's face) But I could be bad if you like. (Spike looks away from her, but the UberVamp punches him in the head) Bad daddy. Needs a caning. Never learned his headmaster's lesson while all the school bells ring (mimes ringing a bell) and ring and ring and ring and ring...(bends down to whisper in his ear) Choose a side. Choose our side. You know that it's delicious. (feigns licking his face, but doesn't actually) What do you say?

SPIKE

(whispers) Dru, luv...

FIRST [DRUSILLA]

Hmm?

SPIKE

Get bent.

FIRST [DRUSILLA]

(stands, pouts) Stupid, stubborn daddy.

Drusilla/First holds her hands over her heart and walks away as the UberVamp starts pummeling Spike again. Drusilla/First swings her hips back and forth, watching Spike get beaten, and mumbles to herself.

FIRST [DRUSILLA]

Ringing, ringing, ringing...

31 INT. BATHROOM AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

The school bell rings. Buffy is washing her face in the sink. She touches a sore spot on her face, then goes to inspect her arms as well. She unzips the arm of her blazer to reveal scrapes and bruises worse than we've ever seen on her.

BUFFY

Ow. Oh. Ah.

Cut to:

32 INT. BUFFY'S ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE- DAY

Suddenly, Joyce's loving touch, and her concerned voice speaks.

JOYCE (O.S.)

Buffy, what happened?

BUFFY

(looks up, and finds herself in her house, talking to her mother) Uh, oh, it's OK, Mom.

JOYCE

I tried to warn you, but—right. The last thing you need now is one of helpful Mom's guilt trips. I'll get you some ice.

BUFFY

No. Mom, I-I can't.

JOYCE

Buffy, you have to heal.

BUFFY

I don't have time.

JOYCE

Are you worried about the sun going down? Because there's some things you can't control. The sun always goes down, the sun always comes up.

BUFFY

Everyone's counting on me.

JOYCE

Well, they do that, and I'm sorry, Buffy, but these-these friends of you put too much pressure on you. They always have.

BUFFY

Something evil is coming.

JOYCE

Buffy, evil isn't coming, it's already here. Evil is always here. Don't you know? It's everywhere.

BUFFY

And I have to stop it.

JOYCE

How are you gonna do that?

BUFFY

I-I don't know yet, but—

JOYCE

Buffy, no matter what your friends expect of you, evil is a part of us. All of us. It's natural. And no one can stop that. No one can stop nature, not even—

Cut to:

33 INT. BUFFY'S CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

The school bell rings, and Buffy wakes up at her desk. There's a student sitting in the chair in front of her desk.

BUFFY

Oh, um, I'm sorry. What were we talking about?

TEEN BOY

Only my life. You're just like all the others.

BUFFY

No. No, no, no. I'm different. I'm hip. I relate to the young people. (stands to leave) No, don't go, uh, uh...

TEEN BOY

Roger.

BUFFY

Roger. See? I knew that! (Roger leaves, Buffy sighs and hangs her head in her hands) Oh...

Principal Wood is watching Buffy through his office window.

Cut to:

34 INT. LIVING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

Dawn and Willow are getting weapons from the weapons chest. Giles is pacing. Xander is finishing up working on the living room window. The slayers in training are sitting on the couch.

GILES

This day's almost over. (looks at watch) And the sun will go down in 17 minutes.

XANDER

Hey, junior slayers, don't look so worried. I mean, sure, we don't know where Spike is, or how to fight The First, or if and when the super style vampire is gonna attack us all. However, house—(taps hammer on boarded up windows) boarded up. No all we gotta do is trap this UberVamp in a pantry, and it's game over.

WILLOW

Xander, newbies. Let's ease them in to the whole "jokes in the face of death" thing.

XANDER

Who's joking? That pantry thing could work. Are you saying M. Night Shamalayan lied to us?

BUFFY

(to slayers in training) You'll be OK.

WILLOW

(standing near Buffy now, holding a mace, to slayers in training) OK, or even better. It's like our guarantee. (to Buffy) Um, Buffy, I just, I want you to know that I'm really sorry for letting you down. You know, here before with the magic going all aah and me going all eeee and everything getting all rrrr. I wish I could help out.

BUFFY

No one expects you to make everything right.

WILLOW

So, I can't do everything, but I should at least be able to do something. I have so much power, but when I try to use it—

BUFFY

Don't, OK?

WILLOW

OK. But, you need help, Buffy. I know you, and I know you'll never admit it, but you need help.

BUFFY

(shrugs) I'll be OK. OK, or better. It's like my guarantee.

KENNEDY

(stands, walks up to Buffy and Willow) Hey, are we getting weapons? Trained fighters? Patton is coming? I've heard worse ideas.

ANNABELLE

We'll be armed when the slayer feels we're ready.

MOLLY

I feel ready.

ANNABELLE

You're frightened. You must learn to control your fear.

KENNEDY

(turns to Annabelle) Hey, you know what would help with that? (turns to Buffy) Weapons.

BUFFY

Uh, I don't know about that—

KENNEDY

We're sitting ducks without them.

ANNABELLE

We're with the slayer. Safe as houses.

KENNEDY

(to Annabelle) Do you see the house we're in?

ANNABELLE

It'll come straight for us, won't it?

BUFFY

We should load them up, Giles.

35 INT. DINING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

Andrew is still tied to a chair. Xander walks into the dining room.

ANDREW

Listen to me, man, I've got a bad feeling about this.

XANDER

Of course you've got a bad feeling, dude. You're-you're tied to a chair.

ANDREW

No. Yeah, but above and beyond that. I'm telling you that my spider-sense is tingling. This is gonna get hairy. I'm talking weird with a beard. Better untie me.

BUFFY

And that'll help us, how?

ANDREW

(sighs) OK, I know what you're thinking. Andrew, bad guy. You think I'm a super-villain like Dr. Doom or Apocalypse or-or The Riddler. But I admit I went over to the dark side, but just to pick up a few things, a-and now I'm back. I've learned. I'm good again.

BUFFY

And when were you good before? (Buffy and Xander walk out)

ANDREW

OK, technically, never. Touché. (struggles against his restraints) But I'm like Vader in the last 5 minutes of Jedi with redemptive powers minus a redemptive struggle of epic redemption which chronicles... (stops struggling and sighs) These ropes itch.

36 INT. LIVING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

Buffy's looking out the window, and she turns to speak to Giles as he walks up to her.

BUFFY

How're we doing on time?

GILES

Sunset should be any minute now. Done everything we can. And don't worry, everyone here understands that you're calling the shots.

BUFFY

I just hope I'm calling the right ones.

GILES

You have all my faith. And they're depending on you.

BUFFY

Giles, that's not exactly what I needed to hear right now.

MOLLY

(enters the room, interrupts them) Guys? Annabelle split.

Cut to:

37 EXT. STREET IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT

Annabelle is running down the street, looking over her shoulder. She's run into an industrial manufacturing complex, and as she runs past a dumpster, the UberVamp jumps out and grabs her by the throat, growling and lifting her off the ground. Cut to a shot of her cross pendant necklace falling to the ground.

Fade to black.

*** ACT IV ***

38 EXT. STREET IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT

Buffy has found her way to the same industrial manufacturing complex where Annabelle was last seen being attacked by the UberVamp. She walks past the dumpster and sees Annabelle's body lying still on the ground.

Buffy is visibly upset, taking a moment to contemplate the situation, when the UberVamp attacks her from behind, knocking her to the ground. Buffy crawls away to crouch beside the dumpster. She looks at the UberVamp and then gets up to fight with it. She kicks, he ducks. She punches, he blocks. He punches her in the face, then in the stomach, and Buffy falls to the ground face first. He picks her up and tries to choke her, but she spits blood in his face, startling him, and Buffy manages to escape his clutches. She runs away, hiding in the nearby factory. The UberVamp licks the blood off of his face, growls, and heads after Buffy.

Cut to:

39 INT. FACTORY IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT

Buffy runs into the factory and looks around for somewhere to hide.

She's not making a fast flight since she's limping. She goes deeper into the building, which is very industrial in nature with many vertical metal pipes and valves. The UberVamp has followed her to the building and is looking for her. She surprises it by coming from behind it and smacking it in the head with a large metal pipe, but she doesn't even manage to knock him down. They fight and he wrestles the pipe from her hand when she swings it at him again. He throws the pipe to the ground and they return to martial arts.

He punches her and she bends over at the waist. He kicks her in the chest, sending her crashing into a metal support beam. He comes at her again, and she drops to the ground to avoid his fist. She stands, and he punches and kicks her, finally causing her to double over in pain as he punches her ribs. He punches her in the head, sending her to the ground again. He picks her up, backhands her in the face, then punches her so hard, she flies 25 feet across the room.

He runs toward her, but she looks around and notices a pulley hoisting a pallet of metal beams. Buffy kicks a control lever for the pulley, sending the beams crashing on top of the UberVamp as he comes towards her. Still lying on the ground, Buffy hides her face as they land. She gets up and runs away slowly, still limping, but stops and turns around. Her eyes widen as she sees the UberVamp rising from the pile of metal beams, unhurt. He leaps out of the rubble and sprints after her.

In no time at all, he has caught up to her, grabbing her from behind and throwing her into a concrete wall. She steps back, still standing, as the UberVamp literally crawls up the wall to gain momentum and height to kick her in the face, knocking Buffy to the ground. Then he kicks her in the head again before grabbing her arm and throwing Buffy through a concrete block wall. The wall crumbles down on top of her, the roof caves in, and there's blackness.

Cut to:

40 INT. FACTORY IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT

In the blackness, Xander's voice can be heard.

XANDER

Buffy!

He lifts off part of the metal roof that has fallen on top of Buffy, revealing her body lying there still on the ground in a pile of rubble, her face covered in blood. Xander is flanked by Willow and Giles.

XANDER

Oh, God almighty.

They all stare at Buffy's beaten body.

Cut to:

41 INT. UNDERGROUND CAVE - NIGHT

A frowning Drusilla/First is talking to Spike, who's lying face up on a rock.

FIRST [DRUSILLA]

Do you know why you're alive?

SPIKE

(weakly) Never figured you for existential thought, luv. I mean, you hated Paris.

FIRST [DRUSILLA]

You're alive for one reason, and one reason only. Because I wish it. Do you know why I wish it? (holds her hands to her heart) Because I'm not done with you.

SPIKE

(scoffs) Give it up. (Drusilla/First rolls her eyes and turns away) Whatever you are, whatever you get away with, I'm out. You can't pull this puppet's strings anymore.

FIRST [DRUSILLA]

(snaps back to face Spike) And what makes you think you have a choice? What makes you think you will ever be any good at all in this world?

SPIKE

She does. Because she believes in me.

Cut to:

42 INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Buffy's curled up in fetal position in a chair in an empty room, listening to the others talk in the next room. She's beaten up quite badly, her face bloody and bruised. She stares straight ahead as she listens.

GILES (O.S.)

We could make plans as we always do, but the truth is, Buffy was our plan. There is no back up.

WILLOW (O.S.)

Giles, she looks bad.

GILES (O.S.)

She does. I'm afraid there may be internal bleeding.

WILLOW (O.S.)

What does that mean? Will she—

GILES (O.S.)

Die? I don't think so. I don't know.

WILLOW (O.S.)

What do we do if she can't fight, if she can't beat this thing?

Cut to:

43 INT. DINING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Giles is pacing, talking. The slayers in training are sitting around the dining room table, along with Dawn and Anya. Xander and Willow are leaning against the wall.

GILES

We're back at square one.

XANDER

Which square would that be, exactly?

GILES

I'm not sure. The First predates everything we've ever known, or can know. It's everywhere. It's pure. I don't know if we can fight it.

Buffy walks in, and everyone turns to look, seemingly unaware that she'd been listening.

BUFFY

(solemn) You're right. We don't know how to fight it. We don't know when it'll come. We can't run, can't hide, can't pretend it's not the end, 'cause it is. Something's always been there to try and destroy the world. We've beaten them back, but we're not dealing with them anymore. We're dealing with the reason they exist. Evil. The strongest. The First.

GILES

Buffy, I—I-I know you're tired.

BUFFY

(resolute) I'm beyond tired. I'm beyond scared. I'm standing on the mouth of hell, and it is gonna swallow me whole. And it'll choke on me. We're not ready? They're not ready. They think we're gonna wait for the end to come, like we always do. I'm done waiting. They want an apocalypse? Oh, we'll give 'em one. Anyone else who wants to run, do it now. 'Cause we just became an army. We just declared war. From now on, we won't just face our worst fears, we will seek them out. We will find them, and cut out their hearts one by one, until The First shows itself for what it really is. And I'll kill it myself. There is only one thing on this earth more powerful than evil, and that's us. Any questions?
