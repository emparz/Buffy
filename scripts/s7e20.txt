9 INT. LIVING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The SITs, Giles, and the Scooby gang—minus Buffy, Spike, and Andrew—are sitting together in the living room having a very disorganized discussion. Everyone is talking over everyone else.

GILES

Power to the people? You sound like a child of the seventies.

KENNEDY

What we're saying is we're in charge in charge of ourselves.

FAITH

OK, you guys, let's just try not to freak out.

KENNEDY

All I'm saying is now that Buffy's not here, we finally have some say in how and when we lose our necks.

ROBIN

Maybe you don't have to be so blunt about (gestures a cutting motion with his hand in front of his neck) the losing of the necks bit.

ANYA

(emphatically) No, let the girl speak the truth. We're all on death's door repeatedly ringing the doorbell like maniacal girl scouts trying to make quota.

XANDER

(shifts in his seat) You know, I'm thinking that everyone here shouldn't have a say.

GILES

We just have to find some way of having constructive dialogue without going completely mad.

AMANDA

Do you know the parliamentary procedure? 'Cause that's a convenient way of organizing—

KENNEDY

I just wonder if those of us who have been here longer should have more of a say.

ROBIN

Maybe we should break down into small groups so it wouldn't be so chaotic. Faith, what do you think?

AMANDA

When I was involved with the Model UN, we found the parliamentary procedure to be a total lifesaver. For example, once when I was Uruguay—anyway, one of those "U" countries—it was like here, only we had this system which allowed us to organize our conversation.

While Amanda is talking, Giles whispers to Dawn.

GILES

(to Dawn) She's going to be fine. Really, it's for the best.

DAWN

(to Giles) Yeah? Then why do I feel like this?

FAITH

(to the group) I hear what you're saying, but—

KENNEDY

Shouldn't we get down to business?

WILLOW

(rolls her eyes) You guys, I think we're wasting time arguing about how to argue.

AMANDA

Well, why don't we—?

VI

(to Amanda) Please do not mention parliamentary procedure.

CARIDAD

(under her breath) I second that.

FAITH

Everyone, listen to me. Chill. All right? It's been a long night, and I don't know about you, but I'm wiped. Maybe we should catch some sleep and figure all this out in the morning.

KENNEDY

Do we really have time to waste?

FAITH

Look, I understand you guys are wicked stressed. Frankly, our situation blows. We've got to stay cool. That's the only way we're going to get through this. Can everyone handle that?

VI

Yeah...yeah...we'll get some rest and then tomorrow, things won't seem so—

The lights go out in the house, and everyone jumps and gasps, frightened, asking what happened.

CARIDAD

The lights went out?

AMANDA

I'll get some candles... if we have candles.

KENNEDY

I'll check the fuse box.

FAITH

(looking out the window) Don't bother. All the lights on the whole street just went out.

KENNEDY

Which means?

FAITH

(looking at the group) That the people from the power company have got the hell out of Sunnydale.

VI

I think I'm freaking out.

Cut to:

10 EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

The neighborhood is abandoned except for the last family putting their necessities in the minivan. Buffy walks down the street by herself, with her arms crossed. She sees a house and walks up to it.

Cut to:

11 INT. STRANGER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Buffy walks into the house and looks around. A man comes up to her from within the house and points a shotgun in her face.

MAN

Don't move. Get out of my house.

BUFFY

Hey. (takes the shotgun away from the man, sighs) I thought the place would be empty. I was looking for a place to crash. You know, you really should leave.

MAN

(indignant)You can't just kick me out of my own house.

BUFFY

(shrugs) Why not? It's what all the cool kids are doing nowadays. (walks into the kitchen) This is not your house. It's not your town. Not anymore. (opens the refrigerator) Got any Tab?

Cut to:

Opening Credits.

*** ACT I ***

12 INT. MISSION - DAY

Andrew and Spike are waiting inside the candlelit interior room of the mission. Andrew is lying on the floor on his belly, leaning up on his elbows, propping his head up on his hand, and swinging his feet together like a little boy. Spike is sitting on the floor, leaning against the wall with his knees bent up, and his arms resting on his knees.

ANDREW

(rhythmically) I spy with my little eye something that begins with a "T."

SPIKE

(rolls his eyes) Tapestry.

ANDREW

(smiles) Hey, good one. How did you—

SPIKE

Tapestry's the only thing in the whole bloody room.

ANDREW

Ah...so say you, but I say look deeper. (rolls over onto his back, looks at the ceiling)

SPIKE

I'll look deep into your jugular is what I'll look at.

ANDREW

Don't spazz out.

SPIKE

I'm not— (glares at Andrew) Don't say another word.

ANDREW

(rolls back on his belly, looks at Spike excitedly) Rock, paper, scissors?

SPIKE

What's the matter with you? Don't you understand what's happening?

ANDREW

Uh...yeah. We're waiting here till it's night again so you can ride on your motorcycle without exploding.

SPIKE

And every minute we're stuck here, the slayer's out there facing hell knows what.

ANDREW

Come on. What's the worst thing that could happen to her?

Spike glares at Andrew.

Cut to:

13 INT. BASEMENT AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The potentials and scoobies and Dawn, Giles and Faith are down in the basement having another meeting by candlelight. Anya, Xander and Dawn are sitting at a table. The others are gathered around.

FAITH

All right. So, what do we know?

XANDER

Well, we know we're basically the last humans left in Sunnydale.

CARIDAD

And that all the evil in town wants us dead.

VI

I don't want to die.

ANYA

Don't worry. It's far more likely you'll live long enough to watch most of your friends die first. (looks at Vi) And then you'll die.

KENNEDY

We also know that Caleb told Buffy that everything's going down at the seal. I think we should head—

FAITH

(cuts her off) Let's not get ahead of ourselves. So, we know we've got a lot of enemies. We'll start there.

KENNEDY

Faith, I'm sorry—

FAITH

(cuts her off again) I got this, OK? So let's go over our rogues' gallery. Who exactly do we have here?

DAWN

Well, there's the First, who we can't touch.

XANDER

Then there's our friend the reverend I-hate-women.

ANYA

Who's basically untouchable.

DAWN

There's the 'roid-rage vamps, who are pretty much the worst. And the—

FAITH

Bringers...I think they're our weakest link.

GILES

Are you thinking of attacking the Bringers?

FAITH

Maybe, or... OK, we could kidnap one.

KENNEDY

(nastily) And what? Hold it ransom?

XANDER

(sarcastically) Yeah, I'll get the magazines and start ripping out the letters now. "Dear Mr. First, if you want your Bringer back... well, we'll be surprised because you got, like, 3 million of them. So please disregard this letter. Yours sincerely—"

FAITH

I'm saying we think about getting us a Bringer and making it talk. Find out info on the first and Caleb that way.

ROBIN

How do you think we should catch one if they don't want to be found?

KENNEDY

OK, I'm not sure this is such a good idea. Why try and get information when we already know about the seal? Why don't we send a team to the high school? Do some recon and—

FAITH

No.

KENNEDY

(sits back, raises eyebrows) Just like that? You're not even listening.

WILLOW

(softly, to Kennedy) Sweetie, you're pushing too hard.

KENNEDY

I thought things would be different now, but you keep shutting me down.

FAITH

Things are different, because now... (stands) I'm your boss. Look, you guys, I'm not Buffy. I'm not the one who's been on your asses all this time, but I'm not one of you anymore, either. I'm your leader, which means I go first, and I make the rules, and the rest of you follow after me. Is that clear? So, Kennedy, (points) back the hell off, and let me do my job, all right? (calmly) OK, let's get down to business.

Cut to:

14 INT. WINE CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - NIGHT

Bringers are using welding torches and pick-axes on some stone in a cave under the vineyard. Buffy/First and Caleb look on.

FIRST [BUFFY]

I was hoping you'd bring me some better news.

CALEB

And I wish I had some.

FIRST [BUFFY]

Is this going to do anything? Or is all of this just to make the Bringers sweat? Do the Bringers sweat?

CALEB

Actually, I think they pant, like dogs. And I don't know if this is going to do any good, but we have to try everything.

FIRST [BUFFY]

You realize what will happen if the slayer and her girls get it, don't you?

CALEB

They won't.

FIRST [BUFFY]

(looks at Caleb) That's right. They won't. (walks away) Because you're going to kill all of them and everyone they know.

CALEB

Hallelujah.

Cut to:

15 EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Kennedy walks down the alley alone, looking at the ground and pouting. A Bringer comes up behind her wielding a knife, but someone lassos him around the neck and pulls him to the ground. It's Giles. Giles ties up the Bringer as the other potential slayers go to Kennedy's aid, fighting off the other Bringers that have shown up, using the Bringers' knives against them.

KENNEDY

(stands after killing a Bringer, panting) I've never been the bait before. That was, uh... actually, kind of scary.

CARIDAD

We had your back.

GILES

(tying up a Bringer) You did well. Your performance as a disgruntled minion was spot on.

KENNEDY

I'm method. (smiles) Let's get this back to the captain.

Fade to black.

*** ACT II ***

16 INT. KITCHEN AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DUSK

Giles and a few others come up from the basement to talk to the gang assembled in the kitchen.

DAWN

(sees Giles) Oh, hey. So?

GILES

Uh, the Bringer's dumb. (puts on his glasses)

ANYA

You were expecting, what, a Rhodes Scholar?

GILES

Dumb as in mute.

FAITH

Someone ripped out its tongue.

AMANDA

Oh, gross.

DAWN

Hey...I've been reading this old Turkish spell book. There's an old conjuration that the ancient Turks used to communicate with the dying.

WILLOW

Oh, yeah. I think I've read a translation of it.

DAWN

(wide-eyed) There's a translation of it?! (sighs) I'm over it. Um, so the spell is used to communicate with people who can't talk. Um, like if a person was dying, this spell would let them say their good-byes or, you know, gripe about how nobody came to visit them. Would this help us with Mr. No-Tongue?

WILLOW

Yeah, I think so. I just need to get together a few ingredients.

FAITH

All right. Well, cool. While Willow does that, the rest of us can—

ANDREW (O.S.)

We're back!

Spike walks into the room.

GILES

Spike.

SPIKE

Hey.

ANDREW

(walks into the room, puts his helmet on a shelf) Hi, everybody. I missed you guys a lot. Sorry it took so long to get back from our mission-mission, but we had to wait out the sun. Well, I think our mission went very well. We, uh, we rode on Spike's hog, which was very cool, and, uh... uh, played some amusing games, and—oh! We got some new information. You know what? I really need to urinate. (walks out of the room)

SPIKE

He's a breath of fresh air, isn't he? Thank god I don't breathe. So, I think we got a lead. Where's Buffy?

DAWN

Um... (looks away) she's not here right now.

SPIKE

When's she get back?

WILLOW

(walks toward Spike, wringing her hands, nervously) Uh...while you were gone, we all got together and t-talked out some disagreements that we were having. Um... and eventually, after much discussion, Buffy decided that it would be best for all of us if she took a little time off, a little breather.

SPIKE

(stares in disbelief) Uh-huh. I see. Been practicing that little speech long, have you? (Willow looks hurt and walks away) So, uh, Buffy took some time off right in the middle of the apocalypse, and it was her decision?

XANDER

Well, we all decided.

SPIKE

Oh, yeah. You all decided. (chuckles) You sad, sad, ungrateful traitors. Who do you think you are?

WILLOW

We're her friends. We just want—

SPIKE

Oh, that's ballsy of you. You're her friends, and you betray her like this?

GILES

You don't understand—

SPIKE

You know, I think I do... (disdainfully) Rupert. You used to be the big man, didn't you? The teacher all full of wisdom. Now she's surpassed you, and you can't handle it. She has saved your lives again and again. (the others roll their eyes and avoid eye contact with Spike) She's died for you. And this is how you thank—

FAITH

Hey. Why don't you take it down a notch or two? The time for speech-giving is over, bat boy.

SPIKE

(crosses his arms) Oh, is that right?

FAITH

Yeah, that's right. Save your lack of breath.

SPIKE

(shrugs) All right. (punches Faith)

FAITH

You're pretty sweet on her, aren't you? (kicks Spike in the face) I think it's cute. (Spike punches Faith; she punches him back) They way she's got you whipped. (kicks Spike into the other room where he slides over the dining room table and onto the floor)

GILES

Enough!

Faith goes into the dining room after Spike and starts punching him in the face repeatedly. He kicks her off of him and leaps to his feet.

SPIKE

Finally got what you wanted, didn't you? (exchanges punches with Faith) Where is she?

FAITH

I don't know.

Spike rolls Faith over his back and flings her into the dining room wall pretty hard. She gets to her feet as does Spike, and they stare at each other for a moment before Spike finally walks out the front door. All the others are standing in the doorway watching the fight.

Cut to:

17 EXT. IN FRONT OF BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Spike walks out the front door and down the path toward the street. He pauses, shuts his eyes, and smells purposefully. Finally he catches the scent he's looking for and walks down the street.

Cut to:

18 INT. BASEMENT AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A Bringer is chained to the basement wall as Willow does a spell in another language. Giles, Kennedy, Xander, and Andrew are there as well.

WILLOW

(holding a book open in her hands) Speak to us.

ANDREW

Maybe I should rough him up a little.

XANDER

(to Andrew) Andrew!

KENNEDY

(to Andrew) Quiet!

WILLOW

I don't know, guys. That should have worked. (Giles and Willow stare at the Bringer)

ANDREW

(not sounding like himself, but soft and monotonous) I am a drone in the mind that is evil.

XANDER

(to Andrew) Could you just shut up?

ANDREW

(not sounding like himself, but soft and monotonous) I say I'm part of the great darkness.

KENNEDY

(rolls her eyes) Somebody needs a reality check.

XANDER

Or a muzzle.

GILES

(looks at Andrew) Wait.

ANDREW

(speaking for the Bringer) I'm only a fragment of the we. We work as one to serve the First.

Xander and Kennedy stand and back away from the table where Andrew is sitting. Giles and Willow stand as well, and they all stare at Andrew.

WILLOW

OK, what do you—the we—do for the First?

ANDREW

(speaking for the Bringer) We work to prepare for the inevitable battle.

KENNEDY

(grabs the Bringer's knife off the table and holds it to the Bringer's throat) How? Tell me exactly what the Bringers are doing.

GILES

Kennedy, he can't see the knife.

ANDREW

(speaking for the Bringer) We can feel the knife.

GILES

Kennedy? (holds his hand out to her; she stands and hands him the knife)

ANDREW

(speaking for the Bringer) We attend to the needs of the infinite evil. We exterminate girls and destroy the legacy of the slayer. We build an arsenal beneath the dirt. We obey the commands of our teacher Caleb.

XANDER

Wait. Could we go back to the dirt thing?

ANDREW

(speaking for the Bringer) We build weapons to prepare for the coming war... at the farthest edge of town. We are everywhere. We are like the ocean's waves. We watch your efforts and are not scared. We will laugh at you as you die.

Giles takes the Bringer's knife and slits the Bringer's throat with it. The Bringer goes limp.

ANDREW

(himself again, stands, upset) What the bananas?! You are so lucky that you did not just... magically decapitate me.

GILES

We've got enough here. We need to get Faith in on this. Xander, gather some maps. We need to find a subterranean space large enough to house an armory.

Everyone else leaves the room and goes upstairs.

ANDREW

(following after everyone) I feel used and violated, and... (holds his throat) I need a lozenge.

Cut to:

19 INT. STRANGER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Buffy's sleeping on the bed when there's a knock at the door. A few moments later, Spike walks up to the room where she's sleeping.

SPIKE

(standing in the doorway) There you are. Do you realize I could just walk in here, no invite needed? This town really is theirs now, isn't it? (walks up to Buffy) I heard. I was over there. That bitch. (sighs) She's all about smiles and reformation when you're on your feet, but the moment you're down, she's all about the kicking, isn't that right? Makes me want—

BUFFY

(softly, staring off into the corner) It wasn't just Faith. It was all of them. (looks at Spike) And it's not like they were wrong. Please leave.

SPIKE

No. (excited) This'll change your tune. I came here 'cause I got something to tell you. You were right. Caleb is trying to protect something from you. And I think you were spot on all the way. I think it's at the vineyard. So? You were right. (she still hasn't moved or reacted) Buffy?

BUFFY

I don't feel very right.

SPIKE

(walks closer to her) You're not fooling me.

BUFFY

What do you even mean?

SPIKE

Well, you're not a quitter.

BUFFY

Watch me.

SPIKE

You were their leader, and you still are. This isn't something you gave up, it's something they took.

BUFFY

(looks at him) And the difference is?

SPIKE

We can take it back.

Cut to:

20 INT. BUFFY'S ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Faith and Giles are looking at a map.

FAITH

Sewer tunnel on the north side's closest, so guess we'll start there.

GILES

Sounds fine. What time shall I tell everyone?

FAITH

How about around 7:00? (beat) 7:00 sharp. So, tomorrow we fight.

GILES

Tomorrow. Good night, Faith. (starts to walk away, then turns to her) Faith.

FAITH

Yeah?

GILES

You're doing just fine. (walks away)

Faith starts to walk toward the bed but looks up to see the Mayor (from Season 3) standing there in front of her.

FIRST [MAYOR]

I'd say better than fine. I'd say you're doing a bang-up job.

FAITH

Get out.

FIRST [MAYOR]

(laughs) Well, gosh. (smiles) I think, you know, a "hello" or a "nice to see you" might be a little more welcome. It's the end of humanity, Faith, (shakes his head) not the end of courtesy.

FAITH

You're wasting your time. I know who you are, what you are.

FIRST [MAYOR]

(nods) Yeah. Yeah. (looks at Faith) Nobody's explained to you how this works, have they? (paces) You see... I am part of the First, as you kids call it, but I'm also me, Richard Wilkins III, late mayor and founder of Sunnydale. Here. I'll prove it to you. Ask me a question only I know the answer to. Something like... (laughs) Where did I hide the moon pies in my office? Or... who was my favorite character in little women? Meg. (laughs) I know. I know. Most people guess Beth, but Meg, she's such a proper young lady. Remember when Jo burned her hair?

FAITH

(looks in his face) I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. (walks away) But feel free to keep talking, 'cause, hell, I could listen to you yap all night.

FIRST [MAYOR]

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Language! You're a leader now. You keep throwing the "h-e-double hockey sticks" around, pretty soon, the girls are going to pick up on it. Then what?

FAITH

(nods) You let me worry about the girls.

FIRST [MAYOR]

Of course. Of course. You're doing a great job with them, by the way. Much better than Buffy ever did. You were smart to kick her out.

FAITH

(shakes her head) That's not what we— (the Mayor looks at her, raises his eyebrows in disbelief) Buffy got them this far.

FIRST [MAYOR]

Why are you protecting her? You think she cares about you? She nearly killed you, Faith.

FAITH

It's different now.

FIRST [MAYOR]

(walks up to Faith) No matter what you do, Buffy will always see you as a killer, not as a person. And now you have what she so desperately wants: the respect of these girls. All she needs is an excuse, and she'll finish what she started when she stuck that knife in your belly. You stay on guard, Faith. Buffy's dangerous. If you're not careful, she'll destroy you. (shrugs) I'm just saying.

Fade to black.

*** ACT III ***

21 INT. STRANGER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Buffy is sitting on the edge of the bed. Spike is standing up in front of her.

SPIKE

No?

BUFFY

No.

SPIKE

You mean no as in eventually?

BUFFY

You really have problems with that word, don't you?

SPIKE

You can get them back.

BUFFY

Can, maybe. Should? (sighs, holds her head in her hands) I'm just so tired.

SPIKE

They need you.

BUFFY

Well, I...

SPIKE

It's bloody chaos over there without you.

BUFFY

It is?

SPIKE

Yeah! Yeah, it's, uh... There's junk... You know? Food cartons, sleeping bags not rolled up, everyone's very scared and, uh, unkempt.

BUFFY

(smirks) Sounds dire.

SPIKE

I didn't see a lot. (sits on the edge of the bed beside her) I came, hit Faith a bunch of times, and left.

BUFFY

Really? I mean, not that I'm glad, but—

SPIKE

Oh, you say the word, and she's a footnote in history. I'll make it look like a painful accident.

BUFFY

That's my problem. I say the word, some girl dies...every time.

SPIKE

There's always casualties in war.

BUFFY

Casualties. It just sounds so...casual. These are girls that I got killed. I cut myself off from them...all of them. I knew I was gonna lose some of them and I didn't— (shakes her head, stands up) You know what? I'm still making excuses. I've always cut myself off. I've always— (sighs) Being the slayer made me different. But it's my fault I stayed that way. People are always trying to connect to me, and I just slip away. (chuckles) You should know.

SPIKE

I seem to recall a certain amount of connecting.

BUFFY

(shakes her head) Oh, please! We were never close. You just wanted me because I was...unattainable.

SPIKE

(stands, angrily) You think that's all that was?

BUFFY

Please, let's not go over the past. (sits)

SPIKE

Oh, no, no. Let's hold on here. I'm hummed along to your pity-ditty, and I think I should have the mic for a bit.

BUFFY

Fine. The stage is yours. Cheer me up.

SPIKE

You're insufferable.

BUFFY

Thank you. That really helped.

SPIKE

I'm not trying to cheer you up.

BUFFY

What are you trying to say?

SPIKE

I don't know. I'll know when I'm done saying it. Something pissed me off, and I just— "Unattainable." That's it.

BUFFY

Fine. I'm attainable. I'm an attain-a-thon. May I please just go to sleep?

SPIKE

You listen to me. (kneels in front of her) I've been alive a bit longer than you, and dead a lot longer than that. I've seen things you couldn't imagine, and done things I prefer you didn't. I don't exactly have a reputation for being a thinker. I follow my blood, which doesn't exactly rush in the direction of my brain. So I make a lot of mistakes, a lot of wrong bloody calls. (looks into her eyes) A 100+ years, and there's only one thing I've ever been sure of: you. (Buffy looks away; he reaches toward her face) Hey, look at me. I'm not asking you for anything. When I say, "I love you," it's not because I want you or because I can't have you. It has nothing to do with me. (a tear rolls down Buffy's cheek) I love what you are, what you do, how you try. I've seen your kindness and your strength. I've seen the best and the worst of you. And I understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are. You're a hell of a woman. You're the one, Buffy.

BUFFY

(quietly) I don't wanna be the one.

SPIKE

I don't wanna be this good looking and athletic. We all have crosses to bear. (Buffy chuckles) You get some rest now. I'll check in before first light. You can decide how you want... (walks toward the door)

BUFFY

Spike? (he turns to face her) Could you...stay here?

SPIKE

Sure. (looks at a chair) That diabolical old torture device, the comfy chair. (takes off his coat) It'll do me fine.

BUFFY

No, I mean...here. (touches the bed beside her) Will you just hold me?

Spike sits on the bed beside Buffy and puts his arm around her. She curls up on him, cuddling up to his chest as he puts his arm around her shoulder, holding her head with his hand.

Cut to:

22 INT. BUFFY'S ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The Mayor/First is talking to Faith.

FIRST [MAYOR]

Deep down, you always wanted Buffy to accept you, to love you even. Why do you think that is?

FAITH

You a shrink now?

FIRST [MAYOR]

(pacing) You keep looking for love and acceptance from these people, these friends of yours, but you're never gonna find it. The truth is, nobody will ever love you. Not the way I love you.

FAITH

Get out.

FIRST [MAYOR]

They'll forever see you as a killer.

FAITH

I said get out.

FIRST [MAYOR]

I'll always be with you, firecracker, in everything you do. (disappears in a flash of light)

ROBIN

(touches Faith's shoulder) Faith?

FAITH

(startled) You shouldn't sneak up like that! I almost took your head off!

ROBIN

Sorry, I knocked.

FAITH

Who—what'd you see?

ROBIN

Just—you're looking spooked. What happened? Are you sure you're all right?

FAITH

Oh, what? You wanna rap about my problems now? Are you looking to be the guy who puts the "pal" in principal for me?

ROBIN

OK, you know what? I came up here to talk to you about weapons.

FAITH

(shakes head) Sorry. I don't know what I'm doing. (turns around) I'm just—

ROBIN

Listen, I'm gonna leave you alone. I didn't mean to intrude. (starts to walk away)

FAITH

It was the First.

ROBIN

(walks back into the room; shuts the door) Well, you're really in the game now, Faith. The First doesn't show itself unless it thinks you matter.

FAITH

Lucky me. I'm a player. (holds out her hand) Man, look at that. My hand's shaking. Demons, vampires, women in the penitentiary system—none of that freaks me out.

ROBIN

That's exactly what the First does—finds your Achilles' heel.

FAITH

Nah, it just talked to me. What? It does a heal thing too?

ROBIN

Um, it's a phrase. Your weak spot.

FAITH

Oh, school thing. (looks away) I was kinda absent that decade. (sits on edge of the bed)

ROBIN

(walks up to Faith, sits on the edge of the bed beside her) So, who was it? The First.

FAITH

He was like an old boss of mine.

ROBIN

Just a boss, and he's got you shaking like this? Wouldn't give you a raise, huh?

FAITH

(laughs) Yeah, right. Well, it sounds retarded, but he was like a dad to me.

ROBIN

Oh. It was my mother when it came to me. And I mean it was her, right down to the perfume.

FAITH

(looks at him) Sorry.

ROBIN

(nods) Yeah.

FAITH

I'm just so pissed off at myself. I knew it was a trick.

ROBIN

Yeah, so did I, but I still wanted my mother to hold me like a little baby— (blinks, sits up) in a manly way, of course.

FAITH

Of course.

ROBIN

Listen, nobody wants to be alone, Faith. We all want someone who cares, to be touched that way. (looks at her) I mean, the First deals in figments, but that wanting is real.

FAITH

Hitting things and a whole lot of Jack D dulls it some.

ROBIN

Among other things. (they both smile)

FAITH

(stands) When it came to you, did the First tell the truth?

ROBIN

Yeah.

FAITH

It said to watch out for Buffy, that Buffy's dangerous.

ROBIN

Well, what do you think?

FAITH

(paces) Could be. I mean, we've given her pretty good reason to be pissed off. You know the messed up thing? The First is telling me to worry about her, and I just wish she was here. In a couple hours, I'm gonna lead these girls into some serious crap, and she's the only one—

ROBIN

(exasperated) She's not the only one. You're a slayer too, Faith, and I think you're a good leader.

FAITH

I'm an ex-con who didn't finish high school.

ROBIN

Yeah, well I'm the principal of a school where nobody finished, and I am completely out of my league in this.

FAITH

Well, I hear otherwise.

ROBIN

(scoffs, stands) So, um, tomorrow then?

FAITH

Forget about tomorrow. This is tonight. (pulls his hand toward her face) It's been a while. Am I out of line?

ROBIN

No. You're the leader.

Faith and Robin kiss. He lifts her up in his arms and she pushes him back onto the bed. Robin starts pulling on her shirt as they make out.

23 INT. WILLOW'S ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Willow walks into her room looking at a map.

WILLOW

OK, guys. Giles said Faith wants us to start early in the morning, so— (looks around at her mostly empty room except for Kennedy on the bed) What happened to the girls?

KENNEDY

(lying sexily across the bed wearing a slinky nightie and twirling her hair) Looks like there's only one girl here.

WILLOW

What about the other ones with their sleeping bags and their headgear and their snoring? (smiles) They're not here, are they?

KENNEDY

Nope.

WILLOW

(shuts the door) Well that's nice. (sits on the bed)

KENNEDY

Nice... (kissses Willow) and necessary. (puts her arm around Willow's waist) Come here, you. (pushes Willow back on the bed so they're lying down beside each other; they're still kissing) Foreplay was threatening to turn into twelve-play. (Willow turns away) Something not right?

WILLOW

No. No, I just, uh, guess I'm a little scared.

KENNEDY

It's probably stupid to ask why, huh? Death, war, apocalypse.

WILLOW

Me. I'm just scared that if we... and then I'll... and then...

KENNEDY

And then? (chuckles, plays with Willow's hair) Isn't that the good part?

WILLOW

Good. Yeah, g-good feeling, but also...

KENNEDY

Bad stuff, like unrestrained moaning and screaming with joy?

WILLOW

(turns to face Kennedy) Well, sort of. The unrestrained part. But I've just—I've kind of been in this space where I should be restrained. I've been controlling myself and I— if I lose that control, let myself go, I could just go.

KENNEDY

Hm. (strokes Willow's cheek) You worried you're gonna turn into big bad Willow?

WILLOW

It's not stupid. When we first kissed, I turned into...Warren.

KENNEDY

It's not stupid, but it's not gonna happen. I just want you to know you're safe with me.

WILLOW

Yeah?

KENNEDY

You can float around, and I'll tether you down. (smiles)

WILLOW

(smiles) You'll be like—like my kite string?

KENNEDY

Mm-hmm. You'll be a kite, and I'll be your kite string, OK?

WILLOW

(nods) OK.

KENNEDY

OK. (they kiss) Mmm...come here.

Cut to:

24 INT. KITCHEN AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Xander and Anya are sitting at the kitchen island eating ice cream from the container.

ANYA

(looking at the ceiling) They could show a little respect, you know. (takes a bite of ice cream)

XANDER

(takes the spoon from Anya) Hm.

ANYA

I mean, they should at least acknowledge the fact that some people (Xander takes a bite of ice cream and Anya steals the spoon back) might not want to listen to an a capella concert of people, you know, (takes a bite) moaning and groaning.

XANDER

Hm. (takes the spoon from Anya)

ANYA

Disgusting is what it is.

XANDER

(takes a bite) Little jealous, huh?

ANYA

(takes the spoon away from Xander) Of course I am. I'm a lot jealous. I mean, if we're done having sex, then... I think other people should just knock it off. (takes a bite, looks at Xander)

Cut to:

25 INT. VARIOUS - NIGHT

Buffy and Spike stare into each other's eyes as Spike holds Buffy in his arms on the bed. Buffy's got one hand on Spike's stomach and the other on his hand.

Now I don't think that we lost the feeling,

But we let everything build up inside.

It's only love,

25b INT. BUFFY'S ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Wearing just her bra now, Faith leans on top of Robin. They kiss and caress each other under the covers. Later, Robin lies on top of Faith kissing and caressing her.

It's only love,

But love has been hurting so long.

Willow is lying in bed stretched out on her back as Kennedy trails kisses up her belly. Kennedy works her way up Willow's body, running her hand up Willow's side, and kisses her neck.

Cut to:

26 INT. WINE CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - NIGHT

Buffy/First stares straight ahead.

FIRST [BUFFY]

I envy them. Isn't that the strangest thing?

CALEB

(standing behind her) Well, it does throw me a tad. I mean, they're just—why, they're barely more than animals. Feeding off each other's flesh—it's nauseating. But you. You're everywhere. (walks toward her) You're in the hearts of little children. You're in the souls of the rich. You're the fire that makes people kill and hate. The fire that will cure the world of weakness. They're just sinners. You are sin.

FIRST [BUFFY]

I do enjoy your sermons.

CALEB

And you're in me. Give me strength no man can have.

FIRST [BUFFY]

And the only man strong enough to be my vessel, and I know you feel me, but I know why they grab at each other. To feel. I want to feel. I want to wrap my hands around some innocent neck and feel it crack.

CALEB

Amen.

Cut to:

27 INT. STRANGER'S HOUSE - DAY

Buffy and Spike are sleeping beside each other, holding each other. Spike's got one arm under Buffy and the other across her waist. Buffy's got one arm under Spike's neck and the other hand on top of his hand on her waist. Buffy wakes and looks around, then at Spike.

Cut to:

28 INT. LIVING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

Andrew addresses the potentials and others in Buffy's house.

ANDREW

So, it turned out that all these stone tablets basically said the same thing. The First and Caleb are protecting something, and—and we don't know exactly what it is, but it's something powerful, and they don't want the slayers to get it. I'm thinking it could be a weapon, and if we're looking for an arsenal—

FAITH

You're not coming.

ANDREW

(irritated, leading) If one is looking for an arsenal, what better place to find a—

FAITH

Weapon. OK. Got it. Good. Good thinking, Andrew.

ANDREW

It's a pleasure, Faith. Back to you.

FAITH

(walks into the living room, addresses Willow, Dawn, Xander, and Giles) OK, I need you four to suss out the situation on B. I don't want you talking to her or getting in her way or, for that matter, letting her know you're there. Just do a little recon.

ROBIN

Where do you want me, Faith?

FAITH

By your phone. I'll call you when I need you.

DAWN

What are we looking for? I mean, is there some reason we should spy on Buffy?

FAITH

We're just making sure she's OK. Those of you who are coming with me to the arsenal, you know who you are. Everybody ready? Let's do this thing. (walks toward the door; some of the potentials follow, armed)

Cut to:

29 INT. STRANGER'S HOUSE - DAY

Spike is still asleep on the bed, but Buffy is gone. There is a note on the pillow beside Spike. He wakes, looks around for Buffy, then sees the note. He grabs it and reads it.

Cut to:

30 INT. WINE CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - DAY

Caleb and Buffy/First are walking beside each other. Buffy/First has her arms crossed.

CALEB

Shouldn't be long now. Prophecies say one thing. Brute strength says another. We'll get it out.

Bringers are still using welding torches and other tools on the rocks under the cellar.

FIRST [BUFFY]

I heard you, Caleb.

CALEB

We're almost there.

FIRST [BUFFY]

Yes, that's true. Now, rouse the Bringers. Get them back to work—

Their conversation is interrupted by a Bringer being thrown down the stairs. Caleb and Buffy/First turn to look and see Buffy standing at the top of the stairs.

BUFFY

(cockily, hands on her hips) Hey. Heard you got something of mine.

Fade to black.

*** ACT IV ***

31 INT. WINE CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - DAY

Buffy trots quickly down the stairs to be on the same level as Caleb.

CALEB

Well, if it ain't the prodigal slayer?

BUFFY

(looks around) Where's it at? You know I'm gonna find it sooner or later.

CALEB

No, you're not. I lay one hand on you, and you're just a dead little girl.

BUFFY

(shrugs) Lay a hand on me...if you can.

Caleb takes a swing at Buffy, but (shown in slow motion) Buffy ducks quickly and adeptly without losing balance with moves even Neo of the "Matrix" would be proud of. Caleb swings at her again, but Buffy jumps into the air and does a forward somersault over him, and he misses her again. He turns and swings at her, but she does a forward somersault on the ground this time, staying out of his reach. Buffy stands and runs with Caleb in hot pursuit. She runs over the wine barrels, kicking the last one into Caleb's path causing it to bust and trip him. Buffy stands and stares at Caleb.

FIRST [BUFFY]

(sitting on a wine barrel, looking at the wine-covered Caleb on the floor) Caleb, this is getting embarrassing.

CALEB

(under his breath) Do you have to look like that?

FIRST [BUFFY]

Will you concentrate?

CALEB

(through gritted teeth) 'Cause it's just a little confusing.

FIRST [BUFFY]

Fine. Go. Kill. (disappears in a flash of light)

Caleb finally gets to his feet.

Cut to:

32 INT. TUNNEL - DAY

Faith leads a group of potentials through a dark tunnel, lit only by the handheld flashlights they carry. Faith points her light at a stockpile of traditional weapons along with gas canisters.

FAITH

Everybody stop. I think we just found it.

KENNEDY

Look at all this.

VI

(grabs a sword from the pile, looks around) I don't get it. Why'd they abandon all this stuff?

A Bringer jumps down from the rafters.

FAITH

Maybe 'cause they didn't.

The potentials and Faith fight the Bringers. There's not much light, and it's a very confusing battle with people swinging axes and swords and knives every which way.

Cut to:

33 INT. WINE CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - DAY

Caleb swings a punch at Buffy, but she jumps into the air and does a flip, landing on her feet and avoiding his attack. He lunges at her, but Buffy propels herself up the wall and across the rafter (ala "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon") as Caleb runs under her, unable to stop himself. Buffy jumps to the ground and Caleb swings at her again, but she ducks and he misses her. With her back to the wall, Buffy stares at Caleb as he walks menacingly toward her.

Faith fights off Bringer after Bringer.

Cut to:

35 INT. WINE CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - DAY

Cut to:

36 INT. TUNNEL - DAY

Faith fights off Bringers as the other girls do their parts as well. Amanda shoots a crossbow at a Bringer, but misses. Then she charges him, screaming with rage and intention to finish him off. Vi fights a Bringer with a sword. He has her backed into a corner. Kennedy uses her sword expertly to finish off a couple of Bringers by herself. Vi gets it together and punches her Bringer, knocking him down before she runs him through with her sword. Faith stabs a Bringer with his own knife.

Cut to:

37 INT. WINE CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - DAY

Buffy runs away from Caleb toward the back of the cellar.

CALEB

(calling after her) You whore!

BUFFY

(stops running, turns to face him, casually) You know, you really should watch your language. If someone didn't know you, they might think you were a woman-hating jerk.

Enraged, Caleb pushes over a wine barrel and charges toward Buffy. Buffy looks over in the back corner and sees an open hatch in the floor—it's glowing because of the work the Bringers are doing in the room below. She grins, ducks under Caleb's punch, and slides across the floor into the hatch in the floor. Right as she slides in, the door shuts, and wine barrels fall on top of it, holding the door down.

Cut to:

38 INT. TUNNEL - DAY

Faith stands and looks around at all the dead Bringers and the potentials who are still standing

VI

Is that it? I mean, not that it wasn't fun, but—

KENNEDY

Yo, Faith. Check this out.

Kennedy is shining her flashlight at something in the corner. Faith walks up to investigate. It's a doorway leading down a set of stairs. The girls all go down the stairs. Faith takes the flashlight from one of the potentials.

Buffy walks into the cave-like room under the wine cellar and stares at something she sees in there.

Cut to:

Faith walks over a plank laid across a small waterway and sees a box that's padlocked shut.

Cut to:

41 INT. WINE CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - DAY

Buffy walks up to the rock where the Bringers were working before, and now we see what they were after. Stuck inside the rock is a shiny weapon of some sort—it's got a wide, rounded blade on one end, and a point on the end of the shaft. Buffy's eyes widen as she stares at it in awe. She smiles.

Cut to:

42 INT. TUNNEL - DAY

Faith kicks at the padlock, busting it. She bends down to open the box and finds a timer/detonator reading "00.08" that is wired to a box full of bricks labeled "C4 High Explosive." She immediately jumps back and screams to the others.

FAITH

(yelling to the others) Everybody get down!

The timer counts down in seconds - 00.07, 00.06, 00.05

Closing credits.
