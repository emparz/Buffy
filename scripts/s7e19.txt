7 EXT. STREET - DAY

A man closes his shop. There's lots of traffic and honking on the street. The street is full of cars, all pointed in the same direction, but no one's moving. People are even walking through the street carrying belongings. Buffy walks among them, looking around, when someone in a car calls out to her. It's Clem, driving a late model red VW Beetle.

CLEM

Hey, you.

BUFFY

Hey.

CLEM

Can you believe this mishegaas?

BUFFY

Yeah. You'd think these people had never seen an apocalypse before. (chuckles) What about you? Just going for a quick spin to 7-Eleven... in Nebraska?

CLEM

It's getting bad here. Really bad. Hellmouth acting up again, people feeling it, getting crazier. You can't swing a cat without hitting some kind of demonic activity. Not that I swing cats, or eat—nope. Heh. Cuttin' way back. Cholesterol—morals. I mean, morals.

BUFFY

Right.

CLEM

We've seen some bad stuff in this town before but, you know, this time, it's like it just seems different, more powerful. (shakes his head) I don't think anyone's gonna be able to stop it. (catches himself) I mean, I'm sure you'll do fine. Complete confidence in you. Heh. Uh, if anyone can do it, you can, because you...rock! If you save the world, I'll come back, we'll have drinks. When. When, I mean. When you save the world. (Buffy nods) It's gonna be great with all the... rocking. (sincerely) Maybe... maybe you should just get out of town this time.

BUFFY

Yeah. I probably should.

CLEM

You take care of yourself, OK? (waves, then softly) Bye. (drives off)

8 EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Willow and Giles are talking to an officer outside the police station. The streets there are chaotic too, with the honking and the traffic. Giles is wearing a gray turtle-neck sweater and a black trench coat. Willow's staring intently at the officer.

GILES

Ah, thank you, officer. We—we appreciate your help.

OFFICER

Oh, no, thank you, Inspector. We don't get a lot of contact with Interpol, so we're happy to help you with anything you need. Is there anything else we can help with?

WILLOW

No. Thank you. We're fine.

OFFICER

Right... because— Wait... Who are—who are you?

WILLOW

(started intently at the officer) I'm with the Inspector.

OFFICER

You're with the Inspector. Right. Well, we don't get a lot of contact with Interpol, so—

While Willow and Giles are talking to the officer, two other officers escort a crazy man into the police station.

CRAZY CITIZEN

(rambling to himself) A single step!

OFFICER 3

(to pedestrians) Stay on the sidewalk, folks.

CRAZY CITIZEN

A single step, and it is upon us. It is nigh! From beneath you it—

OFFICER 2

Freakin' nutcase.

The two officers take the crazy man inside the police station.

WILLOW

(looking over at the man) Ow.

OFFICER

Uh, people are acting up, getting nuts. Man, you just let us know if you need help with your guy 'cause we are itching to hand out some justice.

WILLOW

(looking back toward the man) He—he doesn't seem like much of a threat.

OFFICER

(squinting at Willow) And—and you are?

GILES

Um, I think it's time we were catching our flight to, um... Interpol. (pulls Willow away)

OFFICER

Right. OK.

WILLOW

(walking away with Giles) Good idea. My control was fading. What's up with those cops?

GILES

Oh, same as everyone. The hellmouth is active again.

WILLOW

Come on. I want to get back to Xander. (they leave)

The two officers come out of the building and chat with the one Willow and Giles were talking to.

OFFICER 2

(looking off after Willow and Giles) Who was that?

OFFICER

(shrugs) Um, I— I don't know.

OFFICER 3

(holds out a flyer) Did you get one of these yet?

OFFICER

No. What is that?

OFFICER 2

Fugitive. Ran to ground right here in our own backyard.

OFFICER

(eagerly) Yeah? Sounds like a situation that needs some justice.

Cut to:

9 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Buffy and Willow are talking to Xander in his hospital room. Xander's left eye is covered with a bandage. Willow is sitting on the edge of his bed, holding his hand. Buffy's standing, talking to him.

BUFFY

And that you should expect to see some bruising when you remove the bandages. Bruising around the— area. The, uh, bone structure and musculature was hit pretty hard.

XANDER

OK.

BUFFY

Um, also they said that the—the meds may cause you some stomach discomfort, so we're gonna have to be careful with your diet.

XANDER

I can't taste anything right now anyway. I keep waiting for my other senses to improve 50%. Yeah, they should kick in any day now.

BUFFY

(smiling) Well, we're looking at a possible release as early as tonight. Um, we're just waiting for your labs to get back, and Dr. Kallet said that should be a couple of hours.

XANDER

That's great.

BUFFY

(nods) OK. Um, I think we're all caught up then. (holding the files, to Willow) Thank you for this. This was, um, really great work.

WILLOW

(disappointed) Oh. I thought we were gonna... (looks at Xander, then at Buffy) There were gonna be card games.

BUFFY

Oh, no, I just— I should really get back. (Willow looks heartbroken) I want to get everyone started on this. I think we're really close to something.

XANDER

It's OK. It's gotta be done. And I might see you tonight, without depth perception, of course, but... still. (smiles)

WILLOW

(holding Xander's hand) So, I guess you're stuck with me then, huh? (tries to sound chipper) Let's order some cherry-flavored off-brand gelatin, and then I think we'll be up for a rousing game of—

XANDER

I might need a parrot.

WILLOW

Huh?

XANDER

Well, to go with the eye patch, to really complete the look. I think I still have that costume from Halloween.

WILLOW

Yeah, and don't underestimate the impact of a peg leg. Maybe the hospital can hook you up with a nice one. Maybe they have a 2-body-parts for the price of one kind of deal.

XANDER

Oh, you know what the best part is? No one will ever make me watch jaws 3-D again.

WILLOW

Yeah, and, (tries to smile) you'll never have to... (tries to stifle her tears as they well up in her eyes, squeezes Xander's hand tighter)

XANDER

(sighs, looks at Willow as tears well up in her eyes) Oh, Willow... please don't.

Willow looks down, trying to keep her tears from falling. She's desperately trying not to make a scene here, for Xander's sake.

Cut to:

10 INT. BASEMENT AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

Anya is standing in front of the group of potentials lecturing while Andrew stands to her side, writing key words on an easel-pad. Andrew writes "UBERVAMP."

ANYA

And so we know that a battle is coming. Ubervamps galore. We also know that the Ubervamps are hard to kill...

ANDREW

(writing in red) Hard...to...kill.

ANYA

But I have been out talking to some of my old contacts, and they've provided some surprising bits of news. Yay for them! (Andrew draws a picture of an Ubervamp) Uh...OK. For example, Ubervamps can be staked... right through the heart. Zing—poof. (Andrew writes "steak" then crosses it out and writes "stake" beside it) Just like regular vamps. Um...we didn't know this. (Andrew draws a red arrow from the word "stake" to the torso of his Ubervamp drawing) Of course, these guys have incredibly strong sternums, so it's a lot like driving a wooden stake through solid steel. But you guys are all super-strong, right?

KENNEDY

(scoffs) Um...no.

ANYA

Right. OK. Um... but still, heart information, still good to know since holy water seems to run off these guys like they've been scotch-guarded. And, well, sunlight would work, but guess what— they're not coming out during the daytime. (Andrew flips to a clean sheet of paper and draws a yellow smiling sun) Uh, also, beware of their, uh, teeth and the claws they use to shred flesh. (Anya holds up her hand, fingers spread, like she's clawing and shredding with her hand; Andrew writes "teeth, claws")

RONA

OK, you know what? I used to be really afraid of these Ubervamp guys. But then the scary preacher blew into town, and now I'm mostly terrified of him.

ANYA

(flips her note cards) Right, well, um... we're working on getting info on that guy.

AMANDA

Why bother? Nothing works. Nothing will.

ANYA

(shuffling her note cards) OK... I know you're all upset... and I, myself, would much rather be sitting at the bedside of my one-eyed ex-fiance than killing time here with you people in this over-crowded and might I add increasingly ripe-smelling basement. And I would be, too, if not for a certain awkward discussion he and I recently had right over there on that cot immediately following some exciting and unexpected breakup sex. (some of the girls seem grossed out and move off the cot; Andrew writes "breakup sex" on the paper, underlining it) But...I need to give him some space... so I'm doing what I can do, contributing any way I can... and so will all of you. You still need to know this information. We can't stop just because something else is trying to kill you, too.

Cut to:

11 INT. KITCHEN AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

Faith's sitting alone on the countertop in Buffy's kitchen eating potato chips from a bag when Kennedy walks upstairs.

KENNEDY

You got enough to share?

FAITH

Trade ya for a carton of cigarettes and some soap. (Kennedy looks confused) Sorry. Habit. (Faith hands Kennedy the bag) Shouldn't you be down at Hogwarts?

KENNEDY

(takes some chips) Probably. (hands the bag back to Faith)

FAITH

All right. Playin' hooky. Score one for the boarding school brat. Anya's technique's probably a little different than what you're used to.

AMANDA

(walks upstairs from the basement into the kitchen) Do you think there are gonna be questions about her sex life on the test? 'Cause I really hope I don't have to study all that.

FAITH

Yeah. (grins) Whenever she starts talking about getting all sweaty with Xander like that I just remind her I had him first. Shuts her right the hell up.

KENNEDY

Thing is— what's the point? Studying demon hot zones and pressure points doesn't do a hell of a lot of good when preacher man's out there, ready to finish the job he started.

FAITH

No one's come up with any info on Caleb yet?

AMANDA

No. Nothing is working—not research, not Anya's contacts.

KENNEDY

We're lousy with dead ends around here. (crosses her arms) Everyone's feeling pretty pointless. We don't even have a place to start.

BUFFY (O.S.)

Hey, who's here?

Cut to:

12 INT. DINING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

Buffy comes into the house carrying the file Willow and Giles got from the police. Dawn walks into the room, concerned.

DAWN

Hey, Buffy, how's Xander?

Faith, Kennedy, and Amanda go into the dining room.

BUFFY

He's doing really well. He's ready to come home, I think. (smiles, puts down the file on the table, starts opening it)

FAITH

Whatcha got?

BUFFY

Info that Giles and Willow were able to pull off the police database. We figured with Caleb's, you know, overt religiosity thing if we wanna learn more about him, let's find out where he's been.

FAITH

(reading from the file) "Incidents of violence and vandalism connected to California religious institutions in the last 10 years." Looks like this gives us a place to start.

BUFFY

Yeah. I figure we start with California. We don't find anything there, we'll expand the search. But a guy like Caleb didn't just get in the game. He's been playing for a while, and I wanna know where. Whatever it takes. (to Dawn) You good to help?

DAWN

Well, I was gonna do lots and lots of homework, but darn the luck, they went and canceled school, (Buffy hands Dawn papers) so looks like I got the time.

BUFFY

Good.

DAWN

(sits) Hey, Buffy... How was Xander's mood, you know, exactly? (Buffy doesn't look at her) And did you get a chance to talk to the doctor about the meds? Because it seemed like—

FAITH

Hey, pipsqueak, why don't you go get some of the stuff you've already gotten from Giles?

DAWN

Or, um, we can talk about this later, maybe.

BUFFY

(still hasn't looked at Dawn) OK.

DAWN

Yeah. I'll be right back. (leaves the room)

BUFFY

Try to find anything that looks like Caleb, his church, his ring...

KENNEDY

His ability to render a slayer useless in just one punch. (Buffy looks up, hurt; Faith frowns) I didn't— that was stupid. I don't know why I said that.

BUFFY

(stifling tears, stands) Uh, it's OK. Um...you know, I—I have to go to the school to pick up the rest of my stuff.

KENNEDY

(stands) I really didn't mean—

BUFFY

It's fine. Really, it's fine. Don't worry about it. Hey, uh... isn't Anya doing that thing for you guys today?

KENNEDY

Yeah. We were. We probably should head down there now.

BUFFY

(smiles) OK. I'll be back soon. (Kennedy and Amanda leave; to Faith) See that everyone else gets started on this. (leaves)

FAITH

Yeah. (starts reading through the files)

Cut to:

13 INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

Buffy walks through the empty halls past the cleaned-out lockers. She walks into the school office to her old cubicle and sits at her old desk. She picks up a picture on her desk of Buffy, Willow, and Xander, hugging, from their high school days. They were so happy, smiling in the sunshine. Buffy touches Xander's face and sniffles.

CALEB

Oh, now, look... (Buffy looks up to see Caleb standing there right in front of her) Things don't go exactly your way, so here come the waterworks. Ain't that just like a woman?

Fade to black.

*** ACT II ***

14 INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

Resume. Caleb has just confronted Buffy in her old office.

BUFFY

Get out of here.

CALEB

Now, now, little girl. Manners. I do imagine that firebrand tongue of yours has inflamed many a man, weak as they are. (looks around) This here's a, uh... public school, ain't it? Kinda deserted. Only just, I suppose. Folks work so hard at keepin' the Lord out, and look what happens in return. (Buffy backs up to a filing cabinet) He abandons you. (Buffy reaches for a drawer in the cabinet) Not that He could do you much good now, anyway— (Caleb turns to see Buffy trying to reach into the cabinet for something) Ah, ah, ah. (condescending) Wouldn't do that were I you, swee'pea. Fightin' back didn't do you much good last time, did it? And how is poor, sweet Xander? Let him know he's in my prayers, and any time he's willin', I'm ready to... (makes a poking gesture) finish the job.

BUFFY

Go near Xander again, and I will end you.

CALEB

(pushes over Buffy's desk violently, walks purposefully toward Buffy) Mind your manners. I do believe I did warn you once. You're angry... frustrated, scared. I like that in a girl. You really should relax a little. Look at where you are. History's gonna look back at you, at me, at this place, and they're gonna see the glory. Great things are happenin' now, right here. This school, the seal... it's all gonna be a part of the great sweepin' tide of change, and you're gonna be a part of it. Now, why would you wanna miss that? More importantly, why would you want to get in its way?

BUFFY

(scowls) I guess I'm just ornery. (punches Caleb in the face)

CALEB

(laughs) Ha ha ha! Oh, I knew you'd be a wild one—

Buffy kicks him, but he grabs her leg and pushes her down. She kicks his shins, but he picks her up off the ground by her neck.

CALEB

I'm gonna take such sweet pleasure in taming you. (throws Buffy through the window; she lands across the hall, unconscious) I'll see you soon, little lady. (walks away)

15 INT. KITCHEN AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Dawn and Giles are reviewing the police file in the kitchen. Andrew walks in.

DAWN

OK, well, here's the one that stood out. It's, um, a mission up north in Gilroy. (hands Giles some files)

ANDREW

(walks up to the counter) Um, Mr. Giles, Faith stole the last meatball-and-mozzarella-flavored hot pocket out of the freezer even though I had called dibs on it.

GILES

(looking at a picture, ignoring Andrew) I don't see anything.

DAWN

Exactly. No vandalism at all.

GILES

Then why is it in the file?

DAWN

The place was abandoned. (Andrew walks to the freezer in a huff) Um... locals started noticing after a few days that no one was going in or out. 6 members of the order lived there, but when the cops showed up... all gone. Unsolved.

ANDREW

(grabs a box from the freezer) Yup. See, the post-it's still here: "Andrew's. Please do not eat." But the box is empty now. (shakes the box)

GILES

Oh.

DAWN

Oh? Oh, good?

GILES

Not sure. Here... (Giles and Dawn walk into the living room; Andrew follows)

Cut to:

16 INT. LIVING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Giles walks to the desk and pulls a magnifying glass out of the drawer. A bunch of potentials are sitting on the couch and chairs in the living room as well, but they're quiet and solemn-looking.

ANDREW

See, it's not the hot pocket itself— even though it did have that new-and-improved thicker tomato sauce— it's just the fundamental lack of respect.

GILES

(to Andrew) Shut up. Pay attention. (holds the magnifying glass over the photo) Dawn, what do you see?

DAWN

What am I looking for?

GILES

On the back wall, A... knothole.

Through the magnifying glass Dawn can see an imprint of what looks like Caleb's ring in the wood on a wall next to a statue of Mary.

DAWN

That's not a knothole.

GILES

Amanda, would you go down to the basement and get Spike?

DAWN

Maybe this'll help...if this does bring us closer to Caleb.

FAITH

(walks into the room eating a pastry) Sounded like there was news. (Andrew glares at her)

SPIKE

(walks into the room) What's up... Rupert?

GILES

Spike, I have a mission for you.

SPIKE

Oh, really? 'Cause, you know, sometimes our missions end up with you trying to kill me. I'm not fond of those.

GILES

This is bona fide... with real ramifications. Take a look at this. (hands Spike the photo and the magnifying glass)

SPIKE

Looks like our boy's been here. You want me to go check it out?

GILES

I need someone who can take care of themselves in case Caleb has... left some souvenirs. (Spike shrugs and walks toward the door)

ANDREW

(whiney) Are we gonna get to the food-stealing issue soon?

GILES

(calls after Spike) Take Andrew.

ANDREW & SPIKE

(simultaneously, incredulously) What?

DAWN

Well, you are always saying you wanna get out of the house more.

ANDREW

Yeah, but—

GILES

There may be demons... lurking about. You never know. He's a demon expert. He can help.

SPIKE

Oh, please.

GILES

Well, he can bring his pan flute thing along. Excellent. Off you go. (pushes Andrew out of the chair; Andrew follows Spike)

DAWN

(to the other girls) So, see? That's something, right? We'll have some news soon.

AMANDA

Sure. Maybe that'll get us somewhere.

FAITH

(stands) Maybe. (looks at the other girls) In the meantime, the troops here gotta sit and stew, feeling crappier by the minute.

DAWN

We should keep them occupied.

FAITH

Yeah. I know how to keep them occupied.

17 INT. BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

Faith and the girls have gone out to the Bronze night club for some recreation. They're dancing, playing pool, drinking and having fun while Nerf Herder plays "Rock City News" on stage.

NERF HERDER (BAND)

(singing) Living on a wing and a prayer, out on the strip nobody cares. Scabbing off a valley chick, sleeping on the practice room floor. Pretty soon the record company will be banging on your door.

Faith dances with a group of four guys. Amanda and a bunch of the potentials dance together. Dawn and Kennedy are dancing together.

KENNEDY

(dancing) What kind of band plays during an apocalypse?

DAWN

(dancing) I think this band might actually be one of the signs.

NERF HERDER (BAND)

(singing) Rock city news. You gotta pay your dues...

18 INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Buffy walks into an empty house.

BUFFY

Hey. Guys, how's it— (looks around, realizes everyone's gone) going?

GILES

(from the dining room) Buffy. Are you hurt?

BUFFY

Oh... Caleb came back looking for seconds.

GILES

My God, is h-he—

BUFFY

Still able to make me see cartoon birdies all around my head? You betcha. The short lack of consciousness was nice. I feel rested. (sits, groans) So...how did those police files work out? Were they helpful?

GILES

Uh...uh... yes. (sits) Very much so, I think. Um... there's evidence that Caleb may have established a foothold up north.

BUFFY

That's great. That's—

GILES

I, um... I sent Spike to look into it. (sips from his mug)

BUFFY

Spike? Is this a mission from which you intend Spike to return alive?

GILES

Yes. (sets down mug) I sent Andrew with him.

BUFFY

Again I ask the question.

GILES

Buffy, you weren't here. Decisions have to be made in your absence.

BUFFY

Yeah, well, those are the ones that have been scaring me.

GILES

I did what I thought was right.

BUFFY

You sent away the one person that's been watching my back—again.

GILES

(quickly, indignant) We're all watching your back.

BUFFY

Funny... that's not really what it feels like. (stands to walk away)

GILES

Buffy—

BUFFY

Where did everybody go?

GILES

What?

BUFFY

Faith. The girls. Where are they?

GILES

Um...Faith thought that the girls could do with some time off their studies. I—I thought...She took them to the Bronze.

Buffy shakes her head, rolls her eyes, and walks out the front door.

19 INT. SHADOW VALLEY WINERY - NIGHT

Caleb is in the wine cellar talking to someone.

CALEB

You know what I figured out tonight? Every high school in this country, from one end to the other, smells exactly alike. Now, why do you suppose that is?

FIRST [BUFFY]

(walks out from the shadows) And how was our best girl?

CALEB

They always think they should put up a fight.

FIRST [BUFFY]
Did you lay the proper groundwork?

CALEB

That I did. Reckon she got the message, even if she doesn't know it yet. So now the big strong slayer goes back to those girls... she's just so ready to walk them right into it. And all we have to do is give her that one final gentle (sticks his hand through Buffy/First's chest) nudge.

FIRST [BUFFY]

Excellent.

20 INT. BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

Amanda is sitting down drinking a red drink when Faith comes off the dance floor to have a drink of beer she'd left on the table.

FAITH

Hey, hey, how old are you?

AMANDA

17.

FAITH

(takes Amanda's drink from her and drinks it) Yeah, we're gonna get you a real nice 7-up, OK?

Faith heads back to the dance floor. Three police officers walk up to her.

FAITH

(turns, sees the police, smiles) Hey, I was wondering what was taking you boys so long. Where you been?

OFFICER

We're gonna have to ask you to come with us, miss. Outstanding warrants.

FAITH

(playing it cool) Yeah, or we could try this one on instead. How 'bout you guys buy me another drink, (hands them her drink) and we see where the evening takes us.

One of the police officers grabs Faith's hands roughly, puts them behind her, and starts walking her out.

DAWN

(stops dancing when she sees the police with Faith) Hey!

KENNEDY

(follows Dawn over to Faith) What's going on?

FAITH

It's cool. I got it. (an officer takes out his shotgun) It's nothin'. Get—get off me.

OFFICER 4

Shut up.

There's 5 total officers there now, some with their guns drawn, escorting Faith through the crowd as the other girls watch, following them to the door where the officers take Faith out back.

Cut to:

21 EXT. BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

The potentials are still inside watching the officers escort Faith outside.

FAITH

I tell you right now, I'm not goin' back to jail. (gently wrestles herself free of the officers' grip)

Faith walks back toward the door to go back inside the Bronze, but an officer pulls the door shut from the inside.

OFFICER

Who said anything about jail?

Faith turns around to look at them to see three officers pointing handguns at her.

Fade to black.

23 INT. BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

Dawn, Kennedy, Amanda, Rona and other potentials are gathered around the back door to the Bronze. A police officer holding a shotgun guards it, preventing the girls from following Faith outside.

OFFICER

Stay back. This doesn't concern you.

DAWN

(crosses her arms, approaches the officer confidently) You can't keep us in here.

OFFICER

It'll be over before you know it.

Cut to:

24 EXT. BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

The tables have turned outside in the fight between Faith and the police. Faith is lying on the ground as several officers beat her with Billy clubs. She kicks one of them in the ankle, knocking him down, giving her enough time and space to get to her feet. She kicks one man away, but he kicks her, pushing her forward. She punches him.

Cut to:

25 INT. BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

The police officer still guards the door with a shotgun, preventing the girls from going out to help Faith.

OFFICER

Trust me—the best thing you can do is wait here.

DAWN

(cockily) Don't listen to him. He won't hurt us. You know what? I'm just gonna go borrow the phone. (starts to walk away)

The officer cocks his gun and shoots at the lights, frightening the girls who scream and duck for cover.

OFFICER

Best thing you can do is wait... here.

26 EXT. BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

Faith has overpowered one of the police officers and is straddling him as he lies face-down on the pavement while she punches him. Two other officers pull her off of him.

27 INT. BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

The potentials are still trying to get out the back door to help Faith, but the officer is still preventing them.

KENNEDY

(in the officer's face) You're gonna have to shoot us all to stop us.

OFFICER

(smirks) It doesn't really bother me.

RONA

These cops are really gettin' hell mouth.

OFFICER

Back up!

AMANDA

No!

OFFICER

(looks at Amanda) What?

Kennedy takes the gun away from the officer and hits him in the face with the butt of the gun before pointing it at him. The officer knocks the gun out of Kennedy's hands, but can't grab it before Amanda knocks him in the head with a broom handle. On the floor, the officer tries to crawl away, but Rona and Chao-Ahn kick him and then Dawn jumps on his back, kicking and screaming at him. Finally, the girls rush out the back door.

Cut to:

28 EXT. BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

The girls rush outside to find Faith lying on her back on the ground, shielding herself with her arms over her face as the police have ganged up on her, beating her with Billy clubs. Kennedy and Amanda go up to the police men and throw them off of Faith. Faith has a chance to get to her feet now and joins in the fight against the police. She kicks a man against the hood of his car, and grabs the club from another, presses it against his throat, and knocks him into a wall. He sinks down to the ground.

BUFFY

(walks up as the fight ends) Faith! What are you doing?

FAITH

Just blowing off steam. Well, it started that way. Turned when the cops went evil on us.

Dawn, Chao-Ahn, Rona and the other girls come out of the club and gather around Buffy and Faith.

BUFFY

Girls, go home. (glares at Faith) I need to talk to Faith for a minute.

DAWN

Buffy, we weren't—

BUFFY

Dawn— you, too. Go. (the girls walk away; to Faith) What is this?

FAITH

They needed a break, all right? They've been running themselves into the ground. Things just got out of hand.

BUFFY

Taking a break is one thing—I get blowing off steam—but they were fighting. And those girls were drunk! What were you thinking?!

FAITH

Seemed like a good idea at the time.

BUFFY

Yeah, what if someone had gotten hurt?

FAITH

They didn't.

BUFFY

Faith, I need to know that these girls are gonna be safe when I'm not around.

FAITH

No one got hurt, B. Look, you don't even know these girls. Maybe you should have a little more confidence in 'em, let them mess up sometimes, you know, get down and dirty. How the hell else are they gonna learn?

BUFFY

Learning from your mistakes is one thing. But you don't throw children into—

FAITH

They're not children.

BUFFY

That really isn't the point. (walks off)

FAITH

Yeah, what about the vineyard?

BUFFY

(stops walking) What?

FAITH

How safe were they when you dragged them off to meet Caleb? How safe was Rona or Amanda or Molly?

Enraged, Buffy punches Faith in the face, knocking her down to the ground. Buffy walks away. Faith touches her face and watches Buffy go, but doesn't follow.

29 EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Andrew is riding behind Spike on the motorcycle with his arms around Spike's waist, wearing an old football helmet, and Spike drives them through the California countryside at night.

ANDREW

You sure you don't wanna stop and pick up some burgers or something, you know, road trip food?

SPIKE

It's not a road trip. It's a covert operation.

ANDREW

Right. Right. Gotcha. (beat) I—I bet even covert operatives eat curly fries. They're really good.

SPIKE

(rolls eyes, then) Not as good as those onion blossom things.

ANDREW

Ooh, I love those.

SPIKE

Yeah, me, too.

ANDREW

It's an onion... and it's a flower. I—I don't understand how such a thing is possible.

SPIKE

See, the genius of it is you soak it in ice water for an hour so it holds its shape. Then you deep-fry it root-side up for about 5 minutes.

ANDREW

Masterful.

SPIKE

Yeah. (beat) Tell anyone we had this conversation, I'll bite you.

ANDREW

Right.

Cut to:

30 EXT. FRONT PORCH AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Faith is sitting on the front porch railing smoking a cigarette alone as Robin Wood walks up to the house.

ROBIN WOOD

The big meeting hasn't started yet, has it?

FAITH

God, I hope so.

ROBIN WOOD

Faith?

FAITH

You must be Principal Wood. Heard a lot about you. (takes a drag)

ROBIN WOOD

It hasn't really started yet, has it? 'Cause I, uh... I hate being late.

FAITH

Troops are still gathering. I think you're safe. (nods)

ROBIN WOOD

Looks like someone banged you up pretty well.

FAITH

Yeah. Cops. Mostly.

ROBIN WOOD

Mostly?

FAITH

Yeah. (points to her cheek) This one's from someone who just thinks she's a cop. It's my favorite of all my current bruises.

ROBIN WOOD

So someone who thinks she's a cop, huh? (sits) You gonna have to, like...ice her now or something like that?

FAITH

(grins) I'm not gonna kill her. Wanted to, but didn't. By the way, bully for me since no one else said it.

ROBIN WOOD

For what? For not killing Buffy?

FAITH

It's this new thing I'm tryin'.

ROBIN WOOD

(grins) She told me about you.

FAITH

Believe every word.

ROBIN WOOD

So what changed? I mean... why didn't you fight back?

FAITH

(shrugs) Other things matter more.

ROBIN WOOD

I think you're worried about her.

FAITH

(shakes her head) I think you need to brush up on your Buffy and Faith history.

ROBIN WOOD

(chuckles) All right, if you say so. But I read people pretty well. It's a thing I do.

FAITH

(stands) You, uh, live around here, right?

ROBIN WOOD

Uh, no, not exact— Well, it's the center of town, really.

FAITH

This town, walking anywhere after dark is like an extreme sport. Someone who didn't know you very well might think you were out lookin' for a fight or something. (mock-punches him) Maybe you got bigger issues than what's wrong with B. I read people, too. (a car pulls into the driveway) Xander's home.

Cut to:

31 INT. MISSION - NIGHT

Spike pushes open the creaky front door to the mission as Andrew stands nervously behind him. Spike sighs and walks in, followed by Andrew.

ANDREW

No one's here. These kinda places make me feel funny inside.

SPIKE

I'll buy that. You and me got something else in common after all.

Someone jumps out of a closet as they walk past, grabbing Andrew and pushing him against the wall.

ANDREW

Spike!

Spike pulls the robed man off of Andrew, and the man punches Spike. They start to fight. Spike pushes the man against the wall, and he falls to the ground. Spike pushes the hood off of the man's face to reveal a burn mark on the man's cheek. The mark looks like something Caleb made with his ring.

Cut to:

32 INT. LIVING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

There's a hastily made yellow banner painted with "WELCOME HOME" in big red letters hanging over the fireplace. Giles, Dawn and the potentials are gathered in the living room as Buffy and Willow escort Xander in the room. Faith and Robin Wood follow, closing the door behind them.

XANDER

(looking around) Oh, God.

KENNEDY

We didn't have time to do more. You have to pretend there's a big party here.

Dawn goes up to Xander and gives him a big, long, tight hug.

XANDER

That's fine. Parties in this house, I usually end up having to... rebuild something.

BUFFY

Welcome home, Xander. I wanted you to be here for this. I think you'll be interested in what I found out.

WILLOW

W-what did you find out?

BUFFY

I-it's about the cellar. Look, I know that night wasn't fun for any of us... but I figured out some things about that place, and I realize now what we have to do. (Giles looks at her, concerned) We're going back in.

Fade to black.

*** ACT IV ***

33 INT. MISSION - NIGHT

Spike and Andrew recognize the shape of the robed man's scar and stare at him. Spike bends down to get a better look.

SPIKE

Tell me about the mark.

MONK

Oh... (covers the scar with his hand)

SPIKE

Hey! Are you part of Caleb's faction?

MONK

(shakes his head) No! No!

SPIKE

Then tell me what happened.

MONK

(weakly, frightened) I c-can't.

ANDREW

(bends down to get in his face) "Can't" is a 4-letter word! I'm Andrew. I'll be your bad cop this evening. You don't start singing, my associate here—

SPIKE

We're trying to fight him. Caleb. We need your help. (Andrew stands)

MONK

You can't fight him. You can't stop him. You can only run.

ANDREW

(bends down to get in his face) "Run" is a 4-letter wor— (catches himself ) A 3-letter word. (stands)

SPIKE

(stands) Talk.

MONK

I'll do better. I'll show you. (Spike offers the man his hand, helping him to his feet) One night, (grabs a candelabra) some time ago, a man arrived at our doors.

SPIKE

And you said, "come in, do some damage"?

MONK

We are—we are a benevolent order, and, yes, we welcomed him. We offered to feed him... but he had come for something else.

The monk walks up to a statue of Mary in an alcove, just as seen on the picture that led Spike here in the first place. He touches a secret lever, causing the statue to swing out of the way, revealing a secret compartment behind it.

MONK

Behind this, he revealed something even we didn't know was here. A secret room. (walks in; Spike and Andrew follow) He was excited, talking the whole time... destiny, that sort of thing.

SPIKE

Yeah. We hear he's a real smooth talker.

MONK

(takes a tapestry off the wall, revealing an inscription behind it) He was going on about this ancient inscription.

ANDREW

Neat.

MONK

He read it... and he didn't like what it said. His temper... He was the purest evil I've ever seen. He burned his mark upon me. And then I ran and I hid... and I listened to the others die.

ANDREW

Running away...saved your life. (Spike takes the candelabra from the monk and walks up to the inscription) What does it say?

The inscription is Latin words written with Greek letters - Non tibi est. Ei solae tractare licet.

SPIKE

(translating) "It is not for thee. It is for her alone to wield."

Cut to:

34 INT. LIVING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Buffy addresses the meeting of Giles, Dawn, Faith, Willow, Xander, Robin Wood and all the potentials in her living room. Xander is sitting in an overstuffed chair, with Dawn sitting beside him on the arm of the chair. Kennedy is sitting on the sofa, with Willow sitting beside her on the arm of the sofa. Anya is standing beside Willow with her arms crossed.

BUFFY

Look, I know what you're thinking, but I had a visit at the school today from Caleb.

DAWN

Buffy, why didn't you—

BUFFY

I'm fine. I mean, it wasn't fun, but I'm fine. I'm better than fine. I—I figured something out. He kept making all this noise about the school.

ROBIN WOOD

Is it that seal again?

WILLOW

Do we need to try shutting it again?

BUFFY

No, that's just it. We've spent all this time worrying about the seal and the hellmouth. Why isn't Caleb guarding them? Why doesn't he have someone there protecting it? Why is he camped out at the vineyard? The bad guys always go where the power is. So if the seal was so important to Caleb and the First, they would be there right now. They're protecting the vineyard or something at the vineyard. I say it's their power, and I say it's time we go in and take it away from them.

Xander shakes his head and looks down. Giles uncrosses his arms and sighs.

FAITH

(standing beside Robin Wood with her arms crossed) Or, in the alternative, how 'bout...we don't? I mean, it's a neat theory, B, but I'm not going back in that place, not without proof, and neither should you and neither should they.

BUFFY

I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

ROBIN WOOD

I think Faith had the floor.

FAITH

Maybe it ends OK the way you wanna play it, but maybe it doesn't. And right now, I don't think I want you playin' the odds.

BUFFY

Did you come here to fight?

FAITH

Listen, we're fighters, all of us, but you gotta give me something to fight, something real, not—

GILES

(softly) Windmills. (looks at Buffy)

BUFFY

There is something there.

GILES

Maybe. But we can't be sure of that. This is a hell of a lot to ask.

ROBIN WOOD

Too much.

BUFFY

(grinning nervously, looks around) I—I don't understand this. For 7 years, I've kept us safe by doing this— exactly this, making the hard decisions. And now, what— suddenly you're all acting like you can't trust me?

GILES

Didn't you say to me today you can't trust us? Maybe there's something there that should be addressed.

BUFFY

Is that why you sent Spike away, to ambush me?

GILES

(rolls his eyes, sighs) Oh, come on.

RONA

You know what? I am sick of your deal with this Spike guy. This isn't about him. This is about you. You're being reckless.

BUFFY

(steps back) What?

RONA

You are! I don't even know you, and I can tell! You are so obsessed with beating Caleb, you are willing to jump into any plan without thinking.

BUFFY

(through gritted teeth) That's not what I'm doing.

KENNEDY

(stands, walks up to Buffy) Well, that's how it feels to us. People are dying.

WILLOW

(stands, walks up to Kennedy) Kennedy...

KENNEDY

(turns and snaps at Willow) Why are you always standing up for her?

WILLOW

(softly, sadly) I'm not.

BUFFY

What do you mean, you're not?

WILLOW

With everything that's happened, I— (shrugs) I'm worried about your judgment.

BUFFY

(looks around) Look, I wish this could be a democracy. I really do. Democracies don't win battles. (Xander looks away) It's a hard truth, but there has to be a single voice. You need someone to issue orders and be reckless sometimes and not take your feelings into account. You need someone to lead you.

ANYA

(calmly) And it's automatically you. (looks at Buffy) You really do think you're better than we are.

BUFFY

No, I—

ANYA

But we don't know. We don't know if you're actually better. I mean, you came into the world with certain advantages, sure. I mean, that's the legacy.

BUFFY

I—

ANYA

But you didn't earn it. You didn't work for it. You've never had anybody come up to you and say you deserve these things more than anyone else. They were just handed to you. So that doesn't make you better than us. It makes you luckier than us.

BUFFY

I've gotten us this far.

XANDER

But not without a price.

BUFFY

Xander—

XANDER

I'm trying to see your point here, Buff... but I guess it must be a little bit to my left... (shakes his head) 'cause I just don't.

BUFFY

Look, I'm willing to talk strategy, OK, I'll hear suggestions on how to break this down, but this is the plan. We have to be together on this or we will fail again.

GILES

We are clearly demonstrating that we are not together on this!

BUFFY

(commandingly) Which is why you have to fall in line! I'm still in charge here.

RONA

Why is that, exactly?

BUFFY

Because I'm the slayer.

RONA

And isn't Faith a slayer, too?

FAITH

(caught off guard) What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. So not what I meant. I'm not in charge chick. I think B here needs to just...chill out for a little bit, take a siesta or something. But I'm not the one you want.

KENNEDY

Maybe we need a vote... to see who wants Faith to have a turn in charge.

BUFFY

(sternly) No.

KENNEDY

No, what?

BUFFY

No. You don't get to vote until I've had my chance to pal around, you know, get everybody drunk. See, I didn't get this was a popularity contest. I should have equal time to bake them cookies, braid their hair—

FAITH

Learn their names?

BUFFY

(laughs) You're just lovin' this, aren't you?

FAITH

You have no idea what I'm feeling.

BUFFY

(low, mean) Come in here, take everything that I have... You did it before. Did you tell them that? Did you tell them how you used to kill people for fun? Hey, you guys think that's nifty?

GILES

Buffy, that's enough!

FAITH

I didn't come here to take anything away from you, but I'm not gonna be your little lapdog, either. I came here to beat the other guy, to do right, however it works. I don't know if I can lead. But the real question is...can you follow?

ROBIN WOOD

So we vote.

BUFFY

Wait. Guys—

Buffy looks around—Anya's crossed her arms and stares back with pursed lips; Willow looks away—Buffy searches their faces.

BUFFY

I can't watch you just throw away everything that— (looks at Xander and at Dawn, who's not meeting her glance; Buffy holds her head up high) I know I'm right about this. I just need a little— I can't stay here and watch her lead you into some disaster.

DAWN

(stands, walks up to Buffy, softly) Then you can't stay here. Buffy, I love you, but you were right. We have to be together on this. You can't be a part of it. (Buffy blinks her eyes in disbelief) So I need you to leave. I'm sorry, but this is my house, too.

Buffy looks around then walks out the front door.

RONA

Ding dong, the witch is dead.

DAWN

(low, angrily) Shut your mouth.

Cut to:

35 EXT. FRONT PORCH AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Faith follows Buffy outside.

FAITH

(concerned) Hey. Look, I swear I didn't want it to go this way—

BUFFY

(sternly) Don't.

FAITH

I mean it, I—

BUFFY

Don't...be afraid to lead them. (Buffy's face is wet with tears) Whether you wanted it or not, their lives are yours. It's only gonna get harder. Protect them, (looks at Faith) but lead them.

Faith walks back inside the house. Her face tear-streaked, Buffy walks down the front walk alone.
