The library at Sunnydale High School. Buffy is crouched over Kendra

after finding her dead. Behind her a police officer comes in and aims

his gun at her.

Officer#1: Freeze! (Buffy faces him) Put your hands up. Back away from

the girl slowly.

Another officer comes in behind the first, gun drawn and surveying the

scene. Buffy slowly gets to her feet and raises her hands.

Buffy: Look, I didn't do anything.

Officer#1: Do it! Now!

The second officer holsters her gun and crouches down to feel for

Kendra's pulse, but can't find one.

Officer#2: This one's dead.

Officer#1: What about up there? (nods toward the mezzanine)

Buffy and Officer#2 look up at the stacks and see Xander lying

unconscious on the floor behind the railing.

Buffy: Xander...

She starts to go to him, but Officer#2 grabs her and pushes her back.

Officer#2: Get her out of here!

Buffy: Wait! Just see if he's okay! Please!

The second officer hands her off to the first, and then goes to check on

Xander. Buffy offers no resistance, and lets herself be led out.

Officer#2 crouches down by Xander to check him out.

Cut to the hall outside the library. Officer#1 leads Buffy out.

Buffy: Please. You don't understand.

Officer#1: You'd do well to keep your mouth shut, missy.

They turn down the hall and see Snyder coming down followed by two more

officers.

Buffy: But I didn't *do* anything.

Snyder: Why do I find that so very hard to believe?

Officer#1: (to the other officers) In there. (to Snyder) You know this

girl?

Snyder: Buffy Summers. If there's trouble, she's behind it.

Buffy: (angrily) You stupid little troll. You have *no* idea!

Snyder: Attitude problem. Serious.

Buffy: (faces the officer) Look, I just wanna know if my friends are

okay.

Officer#1: All right, that's enough.

He spins her back around and gets out his handcuffs.

Officer#1: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can

and...

Buffy glances over her shoulder, and without warning backhand punches

the officer in the face. He grunts in pain and stumbles backward into

the lockers. She grabs him by the neck and pushes his head down,

flipping him over onto his back. Snyder takes a shocked step back. He is

too stunned by what he just saw her do to move, and just lets her run

down the hall without even looking. Officer#2 comes out of the library

and sees her partner on the floor and Buffy running away. She raises her

gun and takes aim at Buffy.

Officer#2: Stop!

Now Snyder turns around to see Buffy running away, but he's still too

shook up to have the sense to get out of the officer's way.

Officer#2: Get down!

Buffy looks back and turns down an adjacent hall, and the officer takes

a shot. The bullet shatters the window of the hall door. The other two

officers come out of the library, guns drawn and ready, and she waves

them in Buffy's direction. They run in pursuit. She grabs the radio mic

at her shoulder and puts out a bulletin on Buffy.

Officer#2: All units, we have a fugitive on foot at the high school.

Homicide suspect. Female, blond, approximately sixteen years old.

Suspect is *very* dangerous.

Opening credits roll. Buffy's theme plays.

*** Part 1 ***

The hall outside the Emergency Room at Sunnydale General Hospital. Buffy

comes into the hall wearing a wool cap and a long, dark coat. She averts

her eyes from the doctors and nurses. On the wall she finds a slot with

a few patient histories and checks the names on them. There are none

she's interested in. She continues slowly down the hall, avoiding the

eyes of a passing doctor. She checks another series of slots for names

on paperwork, but finds nothing. Further down the hall she turns down

the left passageway. Behinds her Xander walks up and touches her on the

back. She gasps and spins around, but is very relieved to see him

standing there.

Buffy: Xander! (hugs him tightly) Ohhh...

He hugs her back, and they hold each other for a long moment, then Buffy

lets go.

Buffy: I was so worried, I didn't know if you were okay. The cops

were...

Xander: Yeah, I, I heard them chase you out. I was just coming out of

it. (holds up his arm in a cast) Souvenir.

Buffy: Well, what about the others?

Xander sees two police officers come into the hall behind her.

Buffy: Are they okay?

He grabs her in another tight hug. Buffy goes along with it, but wonders

what's up. When she glimpses the cops she hides her face in Xander's

shoulder while they head down the hall in the direction that she came

in. When the police have gone they separate again.

Buffy: Okay. That was about equal parts protecting me and copping a

feel, right? (smiles)

Xander doesn't smile back. He turns his face down looking sad and very

worried.

Buffy: What is it?

Cut to Willow lying unconscious in a hospital bed. She has a bandaged

cut on her forehead and a black eye, but otherwise seems unhurt. The

camera pans up from her face to Buffy and Xander standing next to the

bed.

Xander: The doctor said it was head trauma. She can wake up at any

time, but, um... the longer it lasts, the... less likely it is.

Buffy: I never should've let her try to do that curse. Angel must've

known.

She reaches up to Willow's face and brushes back a few stray hairs.

Buffy: Where are her parents?

Xander: With relatives in Phoenix. I gave them a call. They're...

they're getting on a plane back.

Buffy: Does Oz know?

Xander: (realizes his omission) Oh, man. Um... I didn't even think.

Um... I'll call him.

Buffy hears some footsteps behind her and turns quickly to see who it

is. Xander looks over his shoulder, too, and they see Cordelia come in.

He goes over to her.

Xander: Hey.

Cordelia: (whispers) Hey.

They kiss and hold each other close.

Cordelia: (sighs) How is she? (they separate and look at Willow) The

doctor told me that...

Xander: Yeah. We're, uh... still waiting.

Buffy: You okay?

Cordelia: I ran. I think I made it through three counties before I

realized nobody was chasing me. Not too brave.

Buffy: It was the right thing to do.

Xander: Did Giles keep up with you?

Cordelia: I didn't see Giles.

Buffy: You mean he's not in the hospital?

Xander: No.

Buffy gives them a very concerned stare.

Cut to Angelus' mansion. Giles is lying on the floor. Angelus lies on

the floor facing him and waiting for him to regain consciousness.

Giles: Mm... (stirs a bit and exhales) Ohhh... (lifts his head)

Angelus: Hi, Rupert. I wasn't sure you were gonna wake up. You had me

worried. (hops to his feet)

Giles: (standing up slowly) What do you want?

Angelus: I wanna torture you. I used to love it, and it's been a *long*

time. I mean, the last time I tortured somebody, they didn't even *have*

chainsaws.

He strolls past Giles over to Acathla. Giles turns to watch him and sees

the stone demon with the sword protruding from its chest. Angelus

notices Giles' stare.

Angelus: Oh, yeah. Acathla. He's an even harder guy to wake up than you

are. I mean, I performed the rituals, said all the right phrases...

blood on my hand. Got nothing. Big doughnut hole for my troubles. I

figure you know the ritual. You're pretty up on these things. You could

probably... tell me what I'm doing wrong. (approaches Giles) But

honestly, I sorta hope you don't... (stops in front of him) 'Cause I

*really* wanna torture you. (stares evilly)

Cut to the Summers house. A police officer comes down the stairs to

where Detective Stein is questioning Joyce and goes to stand next to

him.

Joyce: No. I-i-it's impossible. There... there's been some terrible

mistake.

Det. Stein: And you have no idea where your daughter is.

Joyce: She said she was going to her friend Willow's house. (shakes her

head) Maybe she slept over.

Det. Stein: Is that Willow Rosenberg?

Joyce: Yes.

Det. Stein: (to the officer) Second victim.

Joyce: (confused) What?

Det. Stein: Your daughter has a history of violence. Doesn't she, Ms.

Summers?

He nods for the officer to leave the house, and he goes.

Joyce: Well...

Det. Stein: (smugly) You call us. (pulls out his wallet) Okay? (digs

out a card) If she decides to stop by. (hands Joyce the card) Be best if

she just comes in.

He exits the house leaving Joyce very worried and confused.

Cut to Giles' apartment. The door is ajar, so Buffy just comes right in.

Buffy: Giles! Giles!

She looks around, but doesn't see him. Behind her Whistler comes down

the stairs from the loft.

Whistler: I don't think he's here.

Buffy: (pivots around to face him) Who are you?

Whistler: Whistler.

Buffy: What are you doing here?

Whistler: (reaches the base of the stairs) I'm waiting for you.

Buffy: Why?

Whistler: 'Cause I-I-I need a date to the prom.

Buffy is *not* in the mood for jokes right now, so she takes the two

steps over to him, grabs him by the throat and shoves him up against the

wall.

Buffy: I have had a *really* bad day, okay? If you have information

worth hearing, then I am grateful for it. If you're gonna crack jokes,

then I'm gonna pull out your ribcage and wear it as a hat. (lets go)

Whistler: Hello to the imagery! Very nice. (seriously) It wasn't

supposed to go down like this. (moves away from the wall) Nobody saw you

coming. I figured this for Angel's big day. But I thought he was here to

*stop* Acathla, not to bring him forth. Then you two made with the

smoochies... now he's a creep again. Now, what are you gonna do? W-what

are you prepared to do?

Buffy: Whatever I have to.

Whistler: Maybe I should ask, what are you prepared to give up?

Buffy: (exhales) You don't have anything useful to tell me, do you?

What are you, just some immortal demon sent down to even the score

between good and evil?

Whistler: (impressed) Wow. Good guess. (grins)

Buffy: (steps up to him) Well, why don't you try getting off your

immortal ass and fighting evil once in a while? 'Cause I'm sick and

tired of doing it myself.

Whistler: In the end, you're always by yourself. You're all you've got.

That's the point.

Buffy: (disgusted) Spare me. (starts to leave)

Whistler: The sword isn't enough. You gotta be ready. (raises his

voice) You gotta know how to use it!

She goes out the door and slams it behind her.

Cut to the park. Buffy walks through it with her head down. A car drives

by. She steps into the street and watches as the car goes. When she

turns back she sees a police car coming, but doesn't run, instead hoping

that the officer won't notice her. He does, though, and turns on his

lightbar and lets the siren give a brief loud tone. He pulls the car

aside, stops and gets out. Buffy ignores him and keeps walking right

past the front of the vehicle. The officer draws his gun.

Officer#3: Hold right there! (slams his door)

Buffy spins around to face him.

Officer#3: Put your hands on your head! Do it!

She stares at his gun, frightened, and begins to raise her hands.

Suddenly the gun gets kicked out of the officer's hands. He gets kicked

in the face and in the shin, then grabbed and thrown onto the hood of

his car, where he lies unconscious. His attacker faces a surprised

Buffy.

Spike: Hello, cutie. (smiles)

*** Part 2 ***

In the park. Spike takes a step toward Buffy, and she immediately decks

him twice in the face. He grabs her by the shoulders to restrain her,

but she brings her knee up into his gut.

Spike: Now, you hold on a second!

He gives her a good shove away from himself. She reaches into her coat

and pulls out a stake. Spike jumps back and holds up his hands in

surrender.

Spike: Hey! White flag here. I quit.

Buffy: Let me clear this up for you. We're mortal enemies. We don't get

time-outs.

Spike: You want to go around, pet, I'll have a gay old time of it. You

want to stop Angel... we're gonna have to play this a bit differently.

Buffy: (still holding the stake) What are you talking about?

Spike: I'm talking about your ex, pet. I'm talking about putting him in

the bloody ground.

Buffy: (chuckles) This has gotta be the *lamest* trick (lowers her

stake) you guys have ever thought up.

Spike: He's got your Watcher. Right now, he's probably torturing him.

Buffy: What do you want?

Spike: I told you. I want to stop Angel. (snickers) I want to save the

world.

Buffy: Okay. You do remember that you're a vampire, right?

Spike: We like to talk big. (indicates himself) Vampires do. 'I'm going

to destroy the world.' (looks at the officer) That's just tough guy

talk. (steps over to the car) Strutting around with your friends over a

pint of blood. (sits on the hood) The truth is, I like this world.

(pulls the cigarette pack from the officer's shirt pocket) You've got...

dog racing, Manchester United. (pulls one out and drops the pack on the

officer) And you've got people. (exhales) Billions of people walking

around like Happy Meals with legs. It's all right here. (lights the

cigarette and takes a drag) But then someone comes along with a vision.

With a real... (exhales) passion for destruction. (takes another drag

and looks at Buffy) Angel could pull it off. Goodbye, Piccadilly.

Farewell, Leicester Bloody Square. You know what I'm saying?

Buffy: (nods) Okay, fine. You're not down with Angel. Why would you

ever come to me?

Spike: (stands and takes another drag, but doesn't look at her) I want

Dru back. I want it like it was before he came back. The way she acts

around him...

Buffy: You're pathetic.

He punches her in the face. She punches him right back.

Buffy: I lost a friend tonight!

Spike: I wasn't in on that raiding party.

Buffy: And I may lose more! The whole earth may be sucked into Hell,

and you want my help 'cause your girlfriend's a big ho? Well, let me

take this opportunity to *not* care.

Spike: I can't fight them both alone, and neither can you!

Buffy punches him hard in the jaw, making him flinch. He straightens

back up and feels his jaw, checking for blood.

Buffy: I hate you.

Spike: And I'm all you've got.

The police officer begins to stir on the hood of the car.

Buffy: (looks down briefly) All right. Talk.

Spike: (turns to the officer) I'm just gonna kill this guy.

Buffy clears her throat loudly. Spike faces her.

Spike: Oh, right.

Buffy: (raises her eyebrows at him) Let's get inside.

They leave as the police officer begins to wake up and feel his head.

Cut to Willow's room at the hospital. She is still unconscious. Xander

is sitting in a chair and watching her while Cordelia stands.

Cordelia: Do you want some coffee?

Xander: I don't wanna leave. She might, uh...

Cordelia: I'll get it.

Xander: (looks up at her) Thanks.

They clasp hands briefly, and Cordelia goes to get some coffee. Xander

looks at Willow again, deep in thought. He leans over to the bed and

gently takes her hand in his.

Xander: Come on, Will. Look, you don't have a choice here. You gotta

wake up. I need you, Will. I mean, how am I gonna pass trig, you know?

(chuckles) And who am I gonna call every night... and talk about

everything we did all day? You're my best friend. You've always...

He looks at her for a long moment, looks away for an instant and then at

her again, struggling with his emotions.

Xander: I love you.

Her face twitches and her hand gives his a squeeze. Xander's eyes widen

in hope.

Xander: Willow?

She takes a few breaths before responding, with her eyes still closed.

Willow: (whispers) Oz? (speaks) Oz?

Xander leans away, taken aback. Oz hears her as he walks into the room.

Oz: I'm here.

Xander: (looks back at Oz) She's just starting to wake up.

He gets up to let Oz go to her. Oz takes her hand and leans over the

bed. Willow still has her eyes closed.

Oz: Hey, baby.

Willow: (weakly) Hi.

Xander: I'm gonna go get a doctor. (leaves)

Oz: How you feelin'?

Willow: (weakly, eyes still closed) My head... feels big. Is it big?

Oz: No. It's head size.

He leans over her face and gently kisses her on the forehead. He leans

back to look at her and strokes her hair with his other hand. She opens

her eyes tentatively.

Willow: (whispers) Uh... is everybody else okay?

Cut to Angelus' mansion. The camera shows Giles in a chair with his

hands bound behind his back and bleeding from rope burns. The camera

pans up his arms and over his shoulder to Angelus, sitting in a chair

and watching Giles as he cleans his glasses. He breathes on the lenses,

polishes them clean and inspects his work.

Angelus: Rupert, buddy... I'm here to tell you, I'm impressed.

(chuckles)

He drops the cleaning cloth, gets up and goes over to Giles.

Angelus: Hey. Uh... (slides on the glasses) How you holdin' up?

Giles: (looks up at him weakly) Never... better.

Angelus: Glad to hear it. (kneels next to him) Now... (Giles breathes

painfully) Tell me when it hurts. (smirks)

Cut to Buffy's street. She and Spike eye each other as they head up the

walk to her house. Just then Joyce pulls up in her Jeep and sees them

from her open window.

Joyce: Buffy?!

Buffy gives her a glance, but goes right back to watching Spike.

Joyce: (stops the car) Where have you been? (gets out) Are you okay?

(runs over) The police were here! I've been looking for you!

Buffy: Mom, let's, let's go inside, and I can explain.

Joyce: (hysterical) Who is this man? (to Spike) Who are you? (to Buffy)

Are you okay?

Buffy: Mom! I'm-I'm okay.

Joyce: Buffy, terrible things have happened. What were you doing?

Spike: What, your mum doesn't know?

Buffy glares at Spike.

Joyce: (to Spike) Know what?

Buffy: (faces her mom) That I'm, uh... in a band. A-a rock band with

Spike here. (shoots Spike a look)

Spike: Right. She plays the, the triangle.

Buffy: Drums.

Spike: Drums, yeah. She's, uh, hell on the old skins, you know.

Joyce: (unconvinced) Hmm. And, uh, what do you do?

Spike: Well, I sing.

Buffy: You know what? Why don't we go inside, and, and we can talk

about this. (nods)

She starts toward the door, and Spike follows.

Joyce: I'm, I'm not sure how I feel about this.

Buffy turns around to face her. Suddenly a vampire rushes across the

porch, pushes Buffy and Spike aside and jumps down the steps at Joyce,

ready to fight. She screams and does some fast backpedaling. Buffy grabs

him by the shoulders from behind and forces him around to face Spike.

She pulls out a stake while Spike gives him a series of punches to the

face. Spike's last blow sends the vampire spinning around and staggering

away. Buffy thrusts the stake into his chest, and he instantly crumbles

to ash. Joyce just stares in shock. Spike steps down from the porch and

looks at the pile of ash.

Spike: One of Angel's boys.

Buffy: Yeah, probably watching me. Or you.

Spike: Yeah. He won't get a chance to tattle on us now.

Joyce: (utterly confused) Buffy... what... is going on?

Buffy looks at her mother for a moment, exchanges a look with Spike and

realizes that it's time. She steps up to her mom and looks up at her,

hoping against hope for understanding.

Buffy: Mom... I'm a Vampire Slayer.

Joyce just blinks her eyes, raises her brows and shakes her head in

complete dismay.

*** Part 3 ***

Willow's room at the hospital. Oz brings her a bowl of Jell-O. She's

sitting up and on the phone with Buffy. She takes the bowl from Oz with

a smile, sets it down on her lap and begins to play with the spoon. Oz

pulls up a chair and sits down.

Willow: I'm okay, Buffy, really. I mean, I don't feel good, but... I'm

awake, and I know my name and who's President and how many fingers, so

they don't think my brain got mushed at all.

Buffy: (cut to her in her kitchen) Thank God. So sorry I can't be

there.

Willow: I know. (cut to her) I'm sorry I didn't get to cure Angel.

Buffy: Don't be. It just (cut to her) wasn't meant to be. I know I'm

never gonna get him back the way he was. It just makes it easier.

Willow: (cut to her) I guess. Any luck finding Giles?

Buffy: (cut to her) Yep. I got a lucky break.

Willow: What?

Buffy: You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

Cut to their living room. Joyce sits nervously on the couch with the

toes of her shoes turned in. Spike is sitting in an adjacent wicker

chair. Uncomfortable silence reigns. Spike looks around the room. Joyce

lifts her glass, takes a sip of her drink and winces at its strength.

Spike looks down at his lap, lets out a long, bored breath and folds his

hands. Cut to Buffy on the phone in the kitchen.

Buffy: Xander. Angel and the others are holed up outside town. You

remember that funky-looking mansion you showed me that time?

Cut to him sitting on Willow's bed. Behind him she eats her Jell-O. Oz

looks through a magazine.

Xander: (into the phone) On Crawford Street. Sure. That makes sense.

What's the drill?

Buffy: (cut to her) I'm gonna hit it come daybreak.

Xander: (cut to him) You'll need backup.

Buffy: No. (cut to her) You stay there. I'm covered.

Xander: (cut to him) Do you, um... do you think Giles is still alive?

Buffy: (cut to her) I think he is. I just wish he was here to tell me

what to do.

Cut to the living room. The silence is deafening. Spike looks around

some more. Then Joyce has a spark of recognition on her face and looks

over at Spike.

Joyce: Have we met?

Spike: (faces her) Um... you hit me with an ax one time. Remember?

(makes an ax-holding gesture) Uh, 'get the hell away from my daughter.'

(lowers his arms)

Joyce: Oh.

She lets out a little chuckle. Spike sighs with boredom.

Joyce: So, do you, uh, live here in town?

Buffy walks into the room with her arms crossed. They both get up.

Joyce: I-is Willow all right?

Buffy: Yeah. She's fine. (to Spike) All right, talk. What's the deal?

Spike: Simple. You let me and Dru skip town, I help you kill Angel.

Joyce: (confused) Angel? Your boyfriend?

Buffy: (to Spike) Forget about Drusilla. She doesn't walk.

Spike: There's no deal without Dru.

Buffy: She killed Kendra.

Spike: (surprised) Dru bagged a Slayer? (chuckles) She didn't tell me!

(to Joyce, smiling) Hey, good for her! (gets a look from Buffy and loses

the smile) Though not from your perspective, I suppose.

Buffy: (with contempt) I can't believe I invited you into my house.

Joyce: (relieved) So you didn't kill that girl.

Buffy: Of course not.

Joyce: Did she explode like that man out there?

Buffy: She was a Slayer, Mom.

Joyce: Like what you are.

Buffy gives her a thin smile and a nod.

Spike: Look. (pulls Buffy aside) This deal works for me one way. Full

stop. Me and Dru for Angel.

Joyce: (still confused) Honey, a-are you sure you're a Vampire Slayer?

Spike: I'll take her out of the country. You'll never hear from us

again, I *bloody* well hope.

Buffy: (ignores her mother) Fine. Get back to the mansion. Make sure

Giles is all right.

Joyce: I-I mean, have you tried *not* being a Slayer?

They both look at her.

Buffy: Mom!

Spike sighs in exasperation of Joyce.

Buffy: (to Spike) Be ready to back me up when I make my move.

He walks around her toward the door.

Buffy: If Giles dies... (Spike stops and faces her) she dies.

He gives her a final stare and heads out the door.

Joyce: (trying to make sense of it) It's because you didn't have a

strong father figure, isn't it?

Buffy: It's just fate, Mom. I'm the Slayer. Accept it.

Joyce: We should call the police. (heads for the kitchen)

Buffy: No. We're not calling the police.

Joyce: (stops and faces her daughter, smiling) Well, now that we know

that you're innocent, it's...

Buffy: What? You thought I was guilty? Jeez, feelin' the love in *this*

room!

Joyce: No, I didn't think that. It's just... now we have proof.

Buffy: (exasperated) We have my word, Mom. Not proof.

Joyce: (heads for the kitchen again) Look, I am sure that they will

understand.

Buffy: (follows closely) Get them involved, you'll get them killed.

Joyce: Well, you're not gonna hurt them, are you?

Buffy: I'm a Slayer, not a postal worker.

Her mother picks up the phone, and Buffy slaps her hand onto the switch

hook.

Buffy: Cops can't fight demons. (takes the phone from her mom) I have

to do it. (puts the phone back in its cradle)

Joyce: (demanding) Do what? Buffy, what is happening?

Buffy: (doesn't want to deal) Just have another drink.

She turns away from her mother and starts to walk off. Joyce throws her

glass aside in anger, and it breaks on the floor.

Joyce: Don't you talk to me that way! (Buffy stops in her tracks) You

don't get to just dump something like this on me and pretend it's

nothing!

Buffy: (looks at her) I'm sorry, Mom, but I don't have time for this.

(starts for the door again, but stops)

Joyce: No! I am tired of 'I don't have time' or-or 'you wouldn't

understand.' (Buffy faces her) I am your mother, and you will *make*

time to explain yourself.

Buffy: I told you. I'm a Vampire Slayer.

Joyce: (haughtily) Well, I just don't accept that!

Buffy: (steps closer) Open your eyes, Mom. What do you think has been

going on for the past two years? The fights, the weird occurrences. How

many times have you washed blood out of my clothing, and you still

haven't figured it out?

Joyce: (raises her voice angrily) Well, it stops now!

Buffy: (raises her voice also) No, it doesn't stop! It *never* stops!

Do-do you think I chose to be like this? Do you have any idea how lonely

it is, how dangerous? I would *love* to be upstairs watching TV or

gossiping about boys or... God, even studying! But I have to save the

world... again.

Joyce: No. This is insane. (takes Buffy by the shoulders) Buffy, you

need help.

Buffy: (throws off her mom's arms) I'm *not* crazy! What I need is for

you to chill. I *have* to go!

Joyce: (shakes her head) No. I am not letting you out of this house.

Buffy: You can't stop me.

Joyce: (grabs her) Oh yes I...

Buffy shoves her back into the island, making her knock over several

things. She heads for the door, opens it and steps out.

Joyce: (angrily) You walk out of this house, don't even *think* about

coming back!

Buffy just gives her a long stare and leaves. Joyce sighs, having failed

once again at communicating with her daughter. She turns around and

leans on the island with her head in her hands.

Cut to Willow's hospital room. Willow is sitting up in her bed with Oz

in the chair next to her. Xander is sitting on the far side of the room.

Cordelia: (paces) So Buffy's going for the big showdown, huh? Wish we

could help. (to Xander) You know, without dying.

Xander: I don't see how.

Willow: I wanna try again.

Oz: Try what?

Willow: The curse. We never got to finish it. Maybe we *can* restore

Angel's soul.

Xander: I don't like it. You're talking about messing with powerful

magic, and you're weak.

Willow: I'm okay.

Xander: You don't look okay. (to Cordelia) Does she?

Cordelia: You should listen to him. The hair, it's so flat, and the

lips...

Xander: (to Cordelia) Could we stay on topic here, honey?

Cordelia: What?

Xander: (to Willow) Look, it's not a good idea.

Willow: There's no use arguing with me. Do you see my resolve face?

(gives them her resolve face) You've seen it before. You know what it

means. This can help Buffy. If we turn Angel back soon enough, we can

stop him from ever awakening Acathla.

Oz: (gets up) Okay, I pretty much missed out on some stuff, didn't I?

Because this is all making a kind of sense that's... not.

Willow: (to Oz) Go with Cordy to the library and get my things. She'll

fill you in.

Oz: Sure. (kisses her hand) I'll drive.

He walks out of the room with Cordelia close behind. Xander gets up.

Willow: Xander, go to Buffy. Tell her what we're doing. Maybe she can

stall.

Xander: But I...

Willow: (points to herself) Resolve face.

Xander: (gives in) Be careful. (leaves)

Cut to Angelus' mansion. Giles is still tied to his chair, and hangs his

head weakly.

Angelus: You know, I can stop the pain. You've been very brave... (puts

his hand on Giles' shoulder) but it's over. (walks behind him) You've

given enough. (leans down to Giles' ear) Now let me make it stop.

Giles: (panting and shaking with pain) Please!

Angelus: (kneels to face him) Just tell me what I need to know.

Giles: (weakly) In order... to be worthy...

Angelus: (whispers) Yeah?

Giles: (weakly) You must perform the ritual... in a tutu.

Angelus glares at him. Giles doesn't back down.

Giles: Pillock!

Angelus: (stands up) All right. Someone get the chainsaw.

Spike: (wheels himself in) Now, now, don't let's lose our temper.

Angelus: Keep out of it, sit 'n' spin.

Spike: Look, you cut him up, you'll never get your answers.

Angelus: Since when did *you* become so levelheaded?

Spike: Right about the time you became so pig-headed. You have your way

with him, you'll never get to destroy the world. And I don't fancy

spending the next month trying to get librarian out of the carpet. There

are other ways.

Angelus: Enlighten me.

Spike: Hmm. (behind himself) Drusilla? Sweetheart?

She comes in behind him and walks up to them.

Spike: Do you want to play a game?

She puts her arm on his shoulder, and they both look over at Angelus.

Cut to the library. The main area is cordoned off with yellow crime

scene tape. Buffy walks in and just grabs and pulls down the tape. As

she heads toward the table she looks down at the chalk outline of Kendra

on the floor and passes it slowly, careful not to step on it. When she

reaches the table she looks for a moment at the Orb, candles and other

things that were used in the attempt at cursing Angelus. Then she

reaches under the table, pulls out Kendra's large duffel bag and sets it

on the table. As she goes through it Snyder comes into the library.

Snyder: You do know this is a crime scene, don't you? (Buffy looks up

at him approaching) But then... you're a criminal, so that pretty much

works out. (stops)

Buffy: You know I didn't do it. The police will figure it out.

Snyder: In case you haven't noticed, the police of Sunnydale are

*deeply* stupid. (takes a few steps closer) It doesn't matter anyway.

Whatever they find, you've proved too much of a liability for this

school. (takes a breath) These are the moments you want to savor. You

wish time would stop so that you could live them over and over again.

(smiles smugly) You're expelled.

Buffy reaches into the bag and pulls out the sword blessed by the knight

who first slew Acathla. She holds it up and turns it in her hand. Snyder

looks at it, at her and gulps. Buffy gazes at the polished blade.

Buffy: You never ever got a single date in high school, (turns her eyes

to him) did you?

Snyder: Your point being?

She starts out of the library and leans the blade into his face as she

passes him. He bends back nervously and watches her go. This time she

makes no attempt to avoid the chalk markings on the floor. Snyder pulls

out his cell phone and dials. He checks to make sure she's gone and

holds the phone up to his ear.

Snyder: It's Snyder. (smiles) Tell the Mayor I have good news.

Cut to Angelus' mansion. Drusilla kneels behind Giles, patting the sweat

from his forehead.

Drusilla: Is that better? (pats more) Hmm? (pulls away the cloth) Poor

thing. (runs her finger down his cheek) Let's see what's inside.

She runs her hand up the back of Giles' head and over the top. She

closes her eyes and concentrates on reading his thoughts. It doesn't

take long for her to discover something useful. She gasps and removes

her hand.

Drusilla: (into Giles' ear) Of course.

She stands up and goes around to his other side and holds up two fingers

to hypnotize him.

Drusilla: Look at me.

Giles turns his head weakly to look away, trying to resist. She comes

around the rest of the way in front of him, waving her fingers.

Drusilla: Mm-mm-mm-mm.

Finally Giles can no longer resist and looks at her. She waves her

fingers around some more and draws them in toward her own eyes.

Drusilla: Be... in me.

In his weakened state Giles quickly falls under her spell. She looks

into his eyes and smiles.

Drusilla: Hmm. See with your heart.

She covers his eyes with her hand, and when she takes it away he sees

Jenny kneeling before him. At first he can't believe it, but then

accepts it.

Giles: (smiles) Jenny! I thought I'd lost you.

Dru [Jenny]: (quietly) Shh. I'll never leave you.

Giles: (tries to get up) We have to get out of here.

Dru [Jenny]: (calms him) No-no-no-no-no. Slowly.

She brushes her hand over his temple, down his cheek and over his lips.

Giles: It can't be you. (stares into her eyes)

Dru [Jenny]: Did you tell Angel? About the ritual?

Giles: (breathing erratically) No. (desperately) We have to get... him

away from Acathla.

Dru [Jenny]: Why? Is he close to figuring it out?

Giles: (nods, anxious to go) Later.

Dru [Jenny]: (imploringly) Tell me what to do.

Giles looks at her, helpless and confused.

Dru [Jenny]: It's all right. We'll be together... finally. We'll have

everything we never got to have... Never got to feel... Just tell me

what to do.

Giles: (desperately) We have to get Angel away from Acathla.

Dru [Jenny]: Angel himself? He's the key?

Giles: (weakly) H-h-his, his blood... H-he mustn't...

Dru [Jenny]: Shh. (kisses him) Mm.

They kiss passionately. The camera pulls over to Giles' face. When it

pans back he's kissing Drusilla. The camera continues to pan over to

Angelus and Spike as they watch, pleased with the result.

Angelus: Blood. Of course. The blood on my hands must be my own. I am

the key that will open up the door. My blood. My life. (considers) Okay.

Kill him. (turns to go)

Spike: Uh, but what if he's lying?

Angelus: Yeah. Good point. Alright, don't kill him. (leans down to

Spike) You know, I kinda like having you watch my back. It's kinda like

old times. (chuckles)

They both look over at Drusilla, still kissing Giles.

Spike: Uh, Drusilla...

She keeps kissing him.

Angelus: Honey...

Spike: We are finished here, ducks.

She stops and looks back at them sheepishly.

Drusilla: Sorry. (smiles evilly) I was in the moment.

Giles opens his eyes and realizes that he's been tricked.

Cut to Giles' apartment. Whistler walks into the kitchen and looks

around. He spots a bottle of sherry and takes a sniff, but then sees

that it's empty. He puts it back down and keeps looking around. Buffy

comes in and sees him there. He goes over to check out the refrigerator.

Buffy: Whistler. What did you mean, the sword isn't enough?

Whistler: (finds a bottle of beer) You know, raiding an Englishman's

fridge is like dating a nun. You're never gonna get the good stuff.

Buffy: Tell me how to use it.

Whistler: (takes a swig and looks back at Buffy) Angel's the key.

(closes the fridge) His blood will open the door to Hell. Acathla opens

his big mouth, creates a vortex. Then only Angel's blood will close it.

One blow will send 'em both back to Hell. But I strongly suggest that

you get there before that happens, 'cause the faster you kill Angel, the

easier it's gonna be on you.

Buffy: Don't worry about me.

Whistler: It's all on the line here, kid.

Buffy: I can deal. (sadly) I got nothing left to lose. (leaves)

Whistler: Wrong, kid. You got one more thing.

*** Part 4 ***

Outside Angelus' mansion. The camera pans along its dark facade. Cut to

the street. Buffy walks toward the mansion at a determined pace with the

sword wrapped in a cloth. Suddenly Xander comes running out of the

bushes on the hillside and jumps into the street in front of her. She

startles and takes a reflexive step back.

Buffy: Xander!

Xander: Cavalry's here. Cavalry's a frightened guy with a rock, (holds

up a large rock) but it's here.

Buffy holds up a stake. He tosses the rock aside and takes it from her.

Xander: That's better.

Buffy: You're not here to fight. (starts walking) You get Giles out,

and you run like hell, understood? I can't protect you. (pulls off and

discards the cloth) I'm gonna be too busy killing.

Xander: (looks at the sword) Now, that's a new look for you.

Buffy: It's a present for Angel.

Xander: Willow. (stops) Uh, she told me to tell you...

Buffy: Tell me what?

Xander: (pauses to think) Kick his ass.

Without a word she continues walking. Xander hesitates a moment and then

follows.

Cut inside the main hall of the mansion. Spike in his wheelchair,

Angelus and Drusilla stand at one end near the large fireplace. The

camera pans along the other side behind Acathla and the two other

vampires standing on either side. Angelus begins the ritual.

Angelus: Acathla... Mundatus sum... pro te necavi. Sanguinem meum...

pro te effundam... (steps slowly toward Acathla) quo me dignum... esse

demonstrem.

Translation: Acathla... I am cleansed... here before you. My blood...

flowing before you... (steps slowly toward Acathla) makes me worthy...

as I demonstrate.

Cut to Willow's hospital room. Cordelia and Oz are back with the Orb and

the candles, and they have everything set up on the tray table over the

bed - the Orb surrounded by the candles within a sacred circle. Cordelia

stands on one side and waves burning herbs and incense over the Orb. Oz

stands on the other side with an open Latin book. Willow sits up in her

bed holding the printout of the Rumanian curse. The camera looks down

from above and closes in on them.

Willow: Are we ready?

Cordelia: Stinky herbs are a go.

Oz: Did I mention I didn't take Latin?

Willow: Y-you don't have to understand it. You just have to say it. I

hope.

Oz: Right.

Cut to Angelus' mansion. The camera pans past Acathla's face and the

vampire standing next to him.

Angelus: Now, Acathla...

Cut to Angelus. Drusilla hands him a knife.

Angelus: You will be free.

He draws the blade across the palm of his hand and winces in pain, but

doesn't take his stare off of the demon. He drops the knife.

Angelus: And so will we all.

Cut to the other vampire. The camera pans around him to show Buffy

coming in quietly behind him. She raises her sword and decapitates him

with a single swing. He crumbles to ash as his head falls to the floor.

Drusilla and Angelus turn their heads to look. Buffy meets their gazes.

Buffy: Hello, lover.

Angelus: (bored) I don't have time for you.

Buffy: You don't have a lot of time *left*.

Angelus: Coming on kind of strong, don't you think? You're playing some

deep odds here. Do you really think you can take us all on?

Buffy: No. I don't.

Spike gets up out of his wheelchair behind Angelus with a determined

look on his face and whips him hard across the back with an andiron.

Angelus cries out in pain and collapses to the floor. Drusilla twists

her head to look at Spike. He continues to whale on Angelus as hard as

he can. Buffy starts for Drusilla, but the first vampire attacks her.

She spins around to face him, but he punches her and she falls to the

floor. She trips him when he comes at her again and maneuvers to her

feet, ready to fight. He comes at her again with a series of punches,

all of which she easily blocks. Spike keeps pounding on Angelus.

Spike: Painful, isn't it?

He keeps swinging the andiron. Drusilla begins to freak, and jumps on

Spike, taking him down to the floor with her. Buffy's assailant backhand

punches her in the face, and she goes staggering into a chair by the

wall. She quickly recovers to block another swing, brings her knee up

into his gut and kicks him in the face, knocking him to the floor. She

spies a pile of broken wood fragments and goes to it. The vampire gets

to his feet just as Xander comes into the room and surprises him with a

punch. Buffy picks up a suitable piece of scrap wood and gets back into

the fight. Xander backs off to go look for Giles. The vampire ducks a

roundhouse kick and blocks another kick. Spike and Drusilla get up from

the floor and face each other off.

Spike: I don't want to hurt you, baby.

She grabs him by the throat and shoves him into the wall. He slaps her

arm aside and punches her in the face.

Spike: Doesn't mean I won't.

Cut to the hospital room. Willow casts her stones and gives Oz his cue.

Cordelia keeps waving the burning herbs and incense.

Oz: Quod perditum est, invenietur.

Translation: What is lost, return.

Willow: Not dead... nor not of the living. Spirits of the interregnum,

I call.

Cut to the mansion. Xander pushes aside a curtain to another room and

finds Giles still tied to a chair.

Xander: Giles!

Giles' head is tilted back, and he is very weak.

Xander: Giles!

Giles lifts his head slowly. Xander crouches behind the chair and begins

to untie the ropes.

Giles: Xander?

Xander: Can you walk?

Giles: You're not real.

Xander: Sure, I'm real.

Giles: It's a trick. They get inside my head, make me see things I

want.

Xander has untied the ropes and goes around to look into Giles' face.

Xander: Then why would they make you see me?

Giles: (considers) You're right. Let's go.

He groans as Xander gets under his arm and helps him out of the chair.

Xander: Come on.

They make their way though the main hall as fast as they can and out the

door. Buffy and the vampire continue to fight. Drusilla swipes at Spike

with her hand and leaves four parallel scratches across his cheek. She

follows up with a punch that knocks him to the floor. Angelus wakes up

and groans in pain. He rubs his eyes and looks up at Acathla. He gets to

his feet and goes over to the demon. Buffy is still fighting the

vampire. She blocks a kick from him, punches him, spins around and

punches again, and he falls onto his back. Buffy quickly follows him

down with her stake and jams it into his chest. He bursts into ashes.

Behind her Angelus takes the last few steps to Acathla and grabs the

sword stuck in his chest by the hilt with his bloody hand. A blindingly

bright light emanates from it, and Buffy looks up from her kill in time

to witness Angelus pulling the sword from the demon's heart. With a few

telltale sparks the light is suddenly gone. Angelus whips the sword

around in his hand and holds it up to look at it. Buffy scrambles to get

her own sword. Drusilla looks up from her fight and gazes at Acathla

with a smile.

Drusilla: Oh... Here he comes.

Spike comes up behind her and grabs her around the throat with his arm,

choking her.

Cut to the hospital. Willow continues her chant, but starts to feel

weak.

Willow: Gods, bind him. Cast his heart from the... evil... realm.

Cut to the mansion. Buffy holds up her sword and faces off with Angelus.

He holds his own ready to fight her also.

Angelus: You almost made it, Buff.

Buffy: It's not over yet.

Angelus: My boy Acathla here is about to wake up. You're going to Hell.

Buffy: Save me a seat.

She thrusts at him with her sword, but he parries and swings around with

a thrust of his own, which she also parries. They clash blades several

times, and Buffy ducks a wide arcing swing from him. They face off again

and trade one thrust and parry after another. Angelus tries another

arcing swing from above, but she easily ducks and sidesteps out of the

way. They face off again in front of Acathla and trade a few more blows.

Angelus tries a swing from above a third time, and again Buffy ducks it

and escapes to the side. She jumps up on a low table and swings at him

again. He parries, and swings at her legs. She jumps up and over his

blade and lands on the floor. He tries for her legs again, but she

blocks his attempt with her blade. Again they trade several swings, and

Angelus tries a wide swing again, and this time cuts her superficially

on the arm. He tries to take advantage of her distraction and comes at

her with his sword held high, intending to swing from above, but she

drops to the floor and rolls out of the way, so he only manages to smash

a bowl on a table behind her. Buffy kicks his legs out from under him

and scrambles back up. He turns to face her still on his knees and

swings three times in rapid succession, all of which she parries. He

swings a fourth time, and this time Buffy knocks his sword into the

table with her parry and pins it there. He backhand punches her in the

face, and she spins away. He pulls the sword from the table and swings

it hard at her. She blocks it with hers, and kicks him in the gut,

making him double over. She jumps over him into the clear, and raises

her sword to continue the fight. He thrusts, and she parries. Then he

kicks her in her sword arm, and she stumbles back a step.

Cut to the hospital. Willow gets weaker as she chants and breathes

heavily.

Willow: Return. (pants) I call on... (pants)

Oz: (worried) Willow?

Cordelia: (worried) Are you okay?

Without warning Willow's head snaps back and she looks up with her eyes

wide open. Her head snaps back down and her eyes stare into the Orb. She

begins to chant steadily in Rumanian as though possessed.

Willow: Te implor, Doamne, nu ignora aceasta rugaminte.

Translation: I implore you, Lord, do not ignore this request.

Oz: (to Cordelia) Is this a good thing?

Willow: Nici mort, nici al fiintei...

Translation: Neither dead, nor of the living...

Cordelia: (freaked out) Hey, speak English!

Willow: Lasa orbita sa fie vasul care-i va transporta, sufletul la el.

Translation: Let this Orb be the vessel that will carry his soul to

him.

Cut to Angelus' mansion. The fight has moved out into the atrium. Buffy

hits the ground and scrambles back to her feet as Angelus slowly

advances. She thrusts, and he parries. She spins around and swings at

him, and he blocks her. Her sword bounces off of his and falls with the

tip onto the low wall of a planting bed. Angelus stomps on the blade

before she can raise it again and knocks it from her grip. He spins

around and elbows her in the face, knocking her back into a stone table,

which collapses and falls with her.

Cut to Acathla. Deep thundering growls and noises come from him as he

begins to wake.

Cut to Spike choking Drusilla. She begins to lose consciousness and

slumps over in his arms.

Spike: Sorry, baby. Wish there was another way.

When she begins to fall he catches her, lifts her into his arms and

starts to carry her out. On the way he passes the doorway to the atrium

and glances outside. When he sees them he stops to take a better look.

Buffy is backing up against the wall without her sword while Angelus

slowly and deliberately advances on her holding his.

Spike: God, he's gonna kill her.

He watches for another moment, then shrugs and heads for the garage with

Drusilla.

Cut to the atrium. Angelus plays with his sword, idly pointing it at

Buffy. She looks up at him, frightened.

Angelus: Now that's everything, huh? No weapons... No friends... No

hope.

Buffy closes her eyes and steels herself for whatever's coming.

Angelus: Take all that away... and what's left?

He draws the sword back and thrusts it directly at her face. With

lightning-fast reflexes she swings up with both arms and catches the

blade between the palms of her hands. She opens her eyes and meets his.

Buffy: Me.

She shoves the blade away from her, and the hilt of the sword hits

Angelus in the face. He staggers back, and she hops to her feet and

kicks him in the chest. He stumbles back even more, and she reaches down

and picks up her sword. She swings it around and thrusts at him, but he

manages to parry. They exchange several blows, blocking each other.

Buffy spins around and swings her sword down at him from above. He holds

up his own to block, but she hits it hard and he falls to one knee. She

swings again, and he blocks. She spins around with a roundhouse kick to

his side, and he collapses to the ground.

Cut outside the garage. Spike smashes through the door with his car. The

windows are all painted black. He screeches into the street and guns it.

Cut into the car. Drusilla is lying unconscious in the passenger's seat.

Spike concentrates on the road and whips around a corner. When heading

straight again he looks over at her. He reaches around her neck and

pulls her over to him, and holds her close as he keeps driving with only

one hand on the wheel.

Cut to the mansion. Buffy kicks Angelus, and he comes flying in through

the door, hits the floor and rolls to a stop. Before he can get all the

way back to his feet Buffy leaps in and swings her sword at him. He

almost misses parrying her blow, and he steps back to get his footing.

They exchange a few more swings. Angelus misses a block and gets sliced

on his hand.

Cut to the hospital. The table lurches hard. The camera pans around

Willow and closes in on her face.

Willow: Asa sa fie! Asa sa fie! Acum!

Translation: So it shall be! So it shall be! Now!

Cut to the mansion. Angelus has dropped his sword and holds his cut.

Buffy does a high kick to his face, and he falls backward into Acathla

and lands on his knees before her.

Cut to the hospital.

Willow: Acum!

Translation: Now!

The Orb glows brightly for a brief moment and goes dark. Willow suddenly

relaxes, and looks around blankly.

Cut to the mansion. Buffy raises her sword to dispatch Angelus, but

stays herself when he suddenly gasps loudly and groans in pain. She sees

his eyes glow bright red for an instant and go back dark. He looks up at

her, but quickly collapses to the floor, crying. Buffy stares down at

him, but still holds her sword raised behind her. Angel raises himself

back up, his eyes heavy with tears, and looks into her eyes.

Angel: (softly) Buffy? (sobs) What's going on?

She just looks at him, confused but not yet ready to lower the sword. He

looks around a bit and gets to his feet.

Angel: Where are we? I-I don't remember.

Finally Buffy realizes that the curse has worked, and she slowly lowers

her sword.

Buffy: (softly) Angel?

Angel: (sees her wound) You're hurt.

She looks down at her wound and feels his gentle touch on her arm. She

ignores her cut, looks back up at him and steps closer. He embraces her

tightly.

Angel: Oh, Buffy... God.

She still isn't completely sure that it's true, but accepts the hug.

Angel: I... I feel like I haven't seen you in months.

Finally she accepts it, closes her eyes and breathes out a deep sigh.

Angel: Oh, my God, everything's so muddled. I...

He holds her even more closely.

Angel: Oh...

He sighs deeply and kisses her on the shoulder.

Angel: Oh, Buffy...

She cries into his shoulder and hugs him back. Behind him Acathla lets

out a low rumble. Buffy opens her eyes and stares in shock as Acathla's

face contorts. His brows angle down, his eyes glow red, his mouth opens

grotesquely and the swirling vortex to Hell opens, small at first, but

growing steadily in size and emanating a deep, red glow. Buffy lets go

of Angel and looks up into his face.

Angel: (confused) What's happening?

Buffy: (whispers reassuringly) Shh. Don't worry about it.

She brushes her fingers over his lips and across his cheek. She lays her

hand on his cheek and kisses him softly. He returns the kiss, and it

becomes more passionate. Behind them the vortex has grown to about five

feet (1.5 m) across and continues to get larger. Buffy breaks off the

kiss and looks deeply into Angel's eyes.

Buffy: (whispers) I love you.

Angel: (whispers) I love you.

She touches his lips with her fingers again.

Buffy: Close your eyes.

She nods reassuringly, and he closes his eyes. She tries hard not to

start crying, and kisses him again gently. She steps back, draws back

her sword and thrusts it into his chest. His eyes whip open in surprise

and pain, and a bright light emanates from the sword. She steps away

from him. He reaches out to her and looks down at the sword thrust

completely through him. He looks at her imploringly, completely

bewildered by this turn of events. She can only stare at the sword

protruding from his chest, and slowly steps further back.

Angel: Buffy...

Behind him the power of the sword begins to swirl into the vortex. Buffy

steps further back, still looking only at the sword in his chest and not

into his face. The vortex has enlarged to about twelve feet (3.5 m)

across, and the two energies begin to interact. Angel still holds out

his hand to Buffy. When the vortex finally meets him it suddenly closes

into Acathla's mouth without so much as a spark, taking him with it.

Buffy stares at the stone demon for a long moment, a light of awareness

dawning in her eyes as she truly realizes what she has done, what she

has lost. She begins to sob, her heart breaking. In the background "Full

of Grace", by Sarah McLachlan, begins to play over the scene.

Lyrics: The winter here is cold...

Dissolve to Buffy's street. She walks across it toward her house.

Lyrics: ...and bitter / It's chilled us to the bone / We haven't seen

the sun for weeks / Too long, too far from home

She looks at the neighboring houses, then back at hers. Cut into the

house. Joyce climbs the steps and looks down the hall at Buffy's door.

Lyrics: I feel just like I'm sinking

Joyce: Buffy?

Lyrics: And I claw for solid ground

She walks to Buffy's room and looks in. The windows are open, and some

of her daughter's things are strewn on the bed. She steps in and looks

around.

Lyrics: I'm pulled down by the undertow

She sees a note on the bed among a bunch of clothes.

Lyrics: I never thought I could feel so low

She picks up the note and reads.

Lyrics: And, oh, darkness / I feel like letting go

She begins to cry as she reads and sits down on the bed.

Lyrics: If all of the strength and all of the courage / Come and lift

me from this place

Cut to Sunnydale High School. Xander and Giles walk up to Oz pushing

Willow in a wheelchair with Cordelia at their side. Giles' walk is a bit

unsteady.

Lyrics: I know I can love you much better than this / Full of grace

Giles: Willow, are you sure you should be out of bed?

Willow: Look who's talking.

Giles: (smiles) Yes.

Cordelia: Any word?

Xander: You guys haven't seen her either?

Willow: No.

Oz: But we know the world didn't end, 'cause... (looks around) check it

out.

Giles: (takes off his glasses and squints) Well, we, uh... we went back

to the mansion. I-it was empty, um... and Acathla was, was... dormant.

Willow: I think the spell worked. I felt something go through me.

Cordelia: Plus the Orb did that cool glow thing.

Xander: Well, maybe it wasn't in time. Maybe she had to kill him before

the cure could work.

Oz: Well, then, she'd wanna be alone, I guess.

Willow: Or maybe Angel *was* saved, and they want to be alone together.

Giles: Perhaps.

Cordelia: Well, she's gotta show up sooner or later. We still have

school.

Willow: Yeah. (looks around for her) She'll be here in a while.

Lyrics: Where everything we said and did / Hurts us all the more

They all turn and head into the school.

Lyrics: It's just that we stayed too long / In the same old sickly skin

Cut to Buffy looking at the school from behind a tree. She watches them

as they go in.

Lyrics: I'm pulled down by the undertow / I never thought I could feel

so low

The camera pans around her to her face, looking sadly at the school. A

light breeze sweeps her hair back.

Lyrics: And, oh, darkness / I feel like letting go

She turns around and walks away down the street without looking back.

Lyrics: If all of the strength and all of the courage / Come and lift

me from this place

Dissolve to the inside of a bus. Buffy's reflection is visible in the

window as it drives by her house.

Lyrics: I know I can love you much better than this / Full of grace

Buffy looks out the window calmly as the bus drives on.

Cut to a two-lane road leading out of town. The bus passes under the

camera on its way.

Lyrics: I know I can love you much better than this

The camera pans down to a sign that reads:

NOW LEAVING SUNNYDALE

come back soon!

Lyrics: It's better this way
