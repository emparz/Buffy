Sunnydale High. Cut to the hall by the trophy case. Oz is hunched over

inspecting Catherine Madison's cheerleading trophy. He stares at its

eyes as he moves his head from one side to the other. Willow enters the

hall from outside and comes up to him.

Willow: (smiles) Hi.

Oz: (straightens up) Oh, that's what I was gonna say.

Willow: What cha looking at? (looks into the case)

Oz: (points) This cheerleading trophy. (moves and watches) It's like

its eyes follow you wherever you go. I like it.

He stands back up straight again and gives his attention back to Willow.

They start down the hall together.

Willow: So did you like the movie last night?

Oz: I don't know. T-today's movies are kind of like popcorn. You know,

you forget about them as soon as they're done. I do remember I liked the

popcorn, though. (stops walking)

Willow: (smiles) Yeah, it was good. And I had a really fun time with

the rest. (gets a confused look from Oz) I mean, the part with you.

Oz: Oh, that's great. Uh, my time was also of the good.

Willow: Mine, too. (awkwardness sets in) Well, then...

Oz raises his eyebrows expectantly. Willow looks past him and sees Buffy

down the hall.

Willow: Oh, there. (points) I have my friend. So I will go to her.

(goes)

Oz: I'll see you then. Uh, later. (smiles)

Larry and some other jocks come walking the other direction and stare at

Willow and Buffy walking away. Larry bites his fist and comes over to

Oz.

Larry: Man! Oz, I would love to get me some of that Buffy and Willow

action, if you know what I mean. (laughs)

Oz: (nods) That's great, Larry. You've really mastered the single

entendre.

Larry notices a pretty girl coming down the hall and ignores the insult

to stare at her. As she goes by he taps her books, and they fall out of

her hands.

Girl: Hey!

Larry: Oops!

She bends down to pick up her books, and Larry and the other jocks stare

at her legs.

Larry: Ohhh! Oh, thank you, Thighmaster! (laughs)

The girl gives them a dirty look and leaves.

Larry: So, Oz, man, what's up with that? Dating a junior? Uh, let me

guess. That little innocent schoolgirl thing is just, uh, just an act,

right?

Oz: Yeah. Yeah, she's actually an evil mastermind. It's fun.

Larry: I mean, she's gotta be putting out, or what's the point? What

are you gonna do, talk? (laughs) Come on, fess up. How far have you

gotten?

Cut outside to Buffy and Willow walking along the colonnade.

Willow: Nowhere. I mean, he said he was gonna wait until I was ready,

but I'm ready. Honest. I'm good to go here.

Buffy: Well, I think it's nice that he's not just being an animal.

Willow: It is nice. He's great. We have a lot of fun. But I want

smoochies!

Buffy: Have you dropped any hints?

Willow: I've dropped anvils.

Buffy: Ah, he'll come around. What guy could resist your wily Willow

charms?

Willow: At last count, all of them. Maybe more.

Buffy: Well, none of them know a thing. They all get an 'F' in Willow.

Willow: But I want Oz to get an 'A', and, oh, one of those gold stars.

They sit on a bench.

Buffy: He will.

Willow: Well, he better hurry. I don't want to be the only girl in

school without a real boyfriend.

Buffy looks down sadly. Willow realizes her insensitivity.

Willow: Oh, I'm such an idiot. I'm sorry. I-I shouldn't even be talking

about... Do you want me to go away?

Buffy: I wish you wouldn't.

Willow: How are you holding up anyway?

Buffy: I'm holding. I was going on two minutes there without thinking

about Angel.

Willow: (trying to be cheerful) Well, there you go.

Buffy: But I would do a lot better if you and Xander and I could do

that 'sharing our misery' thing tonight.

Willow: Great. I'll give Xander a call. What's his number? Oh, yeah, 1-

800-I'm-Dating-A-Skanky-Ho. (rolls her eyes)

Buffy: (surprised) Meow!

Willow: (smiles) Really? Thanks. I've never gotten a 'meow' before.

Buffy: Well-deserved.

Willow: Darn tootin'. I'm just saying Xander and Cordelia? I mean, what

does he see in her anyway?

Cut inside Cordelia's car in a secluded area of the park that night. She

and Xander are making out. Suddenly Xander breaks off.

Xander: But what could she possibly see in him?

Cordelia: Excuse me? We didn't come here to talk about Willow. We came

here to do things I can never tell my father about because he still

thinks I'm a... good girl.

Xander: I just don't trust Oz with her. I mean, he's a senior, he's

attractive -- okay, maybe not to me, but -- and he's in a band. And we

know what kind of element that attracts.

Cordelia: I've dated lots of guys in bands.

Xander: (nods) Thank you.

Cordelia: Do you even wanna be here?

Xander: I'm not running away.

Cordelia: Because when you're not babbling about poor, defenseless

Willow, you are *raving* about the all-powerful Buffy.

Xander: I do not babble. I occasionally run-on, every now and then I

yammer...

Cordelia: Xander?

Xander: Yeah?

Cordelia: Look around. We're in my daddy's car, it's just the two of

us, there is a beautiful, big full moon outside tonight. It doesn't get

more romantic than this. (insistent) So shut up!

They start making out again. Cut outside. The camera pulls away from the

car into the bushes until a large, hairy beast watching them comes into

view. It growls menacingly.

Opening credits roll. Buffy's theme plays.

*** Part 1 ***

Inside Cordelia's father's car at the park. She and Xander are sucking

face. Xander hears some rustling outside and breaks off.

Xander: Did you hear that?

Cordelia: What is it now?

Xander: I thought I heard something.

Cordelia: I-is Willow sending out some sorta distress signal that only

*you* can hear?

Xander: Huh.

He smiles at her sheepishly, and they go back to it. An instant later

Xander hears more rustling, louder this time, and pulls back again.

Xander: Okay, now I *know* I heard something.

Cordelia: Alright, that's it. You know, your mind hasn't been here all

night. How about I just drop you off...

A hairy arm with a clawed hand punches through the convertible top.

Cordelia screams and makes a grab for the keys.

Xander: Get us outta here!

The creature on the roof of the car snarls as it reaches around for them

inside. The keys aren't in the ignition, and Cordelia frantically

searches for them on the floor.

Cordelia: (screams) Where are the keys?

Xander: We should be moving! Let's go!

Cordelia: (finds the keys) Oh, I got 'em! Got 'em!

She fumbles with the keys, but manages to get them into the ignition and

starts the car. She puts it into reverse and screams as she guns the car

backward a ways and then slams on the brakes. The beast tumbles off of

the back and into a tree. Cordelia gets the car in drive and speeds

away. The camera shows the car from above with a gaping hole in the

ragtop as it maneuvers back to the road and races off.

Xander: Told ya I heard something.

Cut to the school parking lot the next day. Buffy inspects the hole in

the roof.

Buffy: And you're sure it was a werewolf? (gets off of the car)

Xander: Well, let's see, um, six feet tall, claws, a big old snout in

the middle of his face like a wolf. Um, yeah, I'm sticking with my first

guess.

Oz: Seems wise.

Xander: Oh, oh, and then there was that little thing where it tried to

bite us.

Cordelia: It was so awful. (puts her head on Xander's shoulder)

Xander: (puts his arm around her) I know.

Cordelia: (tears herself away) Daddy just had this car detailed.

Giles comes up behind Buffy with a newspaper.

Buffy: So what's the word?

Giles: Well, it seems there were a, a number of other attacks by a wild

dog around town. (hands the paper to Buffy) Several animal carcasses

were found mutilated.

Willow: You mean, like bunnies and stuff? (upset) No, don't tell me.

(looks at Oz)

Oz: (reassuringly) Oh, don't worry. I mean, they might not look it, but

bunnies can really take care of themselves.

Willow: (calmer and smiling) Yeah.

Oz: Yeah.

Giles: (takes the paper back) Yes, uh, um, fortunately, no people were

injured.

Buffy: That falls into the 'that's a switch' column.

Giles: Well, for now. But my guess is that this werewolf will be back

at next month's full moon.

Willow: What about tonight's full moon?

Giles: (confused) Pardon?

Willow: Well, last night was the night before the full moon,

traditionally known as... 'the night before the full moon.'

Giles: Meaning the accepted legend that werewolves only prowl during a

full moon might be erroneous.

Cordelia: Or it could be a crock.

Xander: Unless the werewolf was using last year's almanac.

Buffy: Looks like Giles has some schooling to do.

Giles: Yes, I must admit I, I am intrigued. Werewolves, it's... it's

one of the classics. (start away) I, I'm sure my books and I are in for

a fascinating afternoon. (leaves)

Buffy and Cordelia watch him go. Xander smirks at Giles' typical

behavior.

Buffy: He needs to get a pet.

Cut to the gym. The class is seated on the bleachers listening to the

female self-defense coach.

Coach: Sunnydale is becoming more dangerous all the time. And a full

moon like tonight tends to bring out the crazies, but with some simple

basics of self-defense each of you can learn how to protect yourself.

Buffy: (quietly to Willow) Here's a suggestion: move away from the

Hellmouth.

Coach: What you wanna do is gain advantage of the situation as quickly

as possible.

Willow smiles at Buffy's suggestion. Behind her Oz reaches up and turns

the tag sticking out of her sweatshirt back inside. She looks back at

him curiously.

Oz: Tag. (pats her on the back)

Willow smiles at Buffy. Cut to Xander and Cordelia.

Coach: Your attacker may have the benefit of surprise.

Xander: Would you look at that? He's all over her.

Cordelia looks over at Buffy, Oz and Willow.

Coach: But if you plot ahead,...

Xander: Psst! Hey, buddy, this is a public forum here.

Cordelia looks back at him, as do Buffy, Oz and Willow.

Coach: ...then you can turn that advantage to yourself.

Cordelia: I think you splashed on just a little too much 'Obsession For

Dorks'.

Coach: By being prepared, you have the power. Okay, everyone get into

your assigned groups.

The students all get up from the bleachers and go down to the floor.

Larry takes off his sweat jacket and goes to the table in front of them

to check which group he's in. Xander sees his arm all wrapped up in a

bandage just above the elbow.

Xander: What happened?

Larry: Oh, last week some huge dog jumped out of the bushes and bit me.

Thirty-nine stitches. They oughta shoot those strays.

Oz: (next to Larry) I've been there, man. (holds up his finger) My

cousin Jordy just got his grownup teeth in? Does not like to be tickled.

Xander laughs. Larry just shakes his head and then goes over to Theresa,

who is doing stretching exercises.

Larry: (into her ear) Theresa! (she straightens up) Be still my shorts.

We're in the same group. (chuckles and nods) I may have to attack you.

Theresa: No, a-a-actually, I think, uh, in our group there are a few of

us.

Buffy: (joins Theresa) And I'm one of the few.

Willow comes up behind her quickly, takes her arm and pulls her aside.

Buffy keeps her eye on Larry another moment, then looks at Willow as she

explains.

Willow: Don't forget, you're supposed to be a meek little girlie-girl

like the rest of us. (walks off)

Buffy: (looks at Larry) Spoil my fun.

Cut to a few minutes later. Everyone is lined up and paired off, girls

in front, boys in back.

Coach: Okay, everyone, listen up. I wanna show you what to do should

you be attacked from behind. (looks at Buffy) In this situation, bend

forward, using your back and shoulders (bends her over to demonstrate)

to flip the assailant over to the ground.

The other girls all bend over, too. The boys follow Larry's lead and put

their arms around the girls' necks. Buffy grabs Larry's arm and pretends

at a few attempts to flip him over. Willow gives her a smile and nod.

Buffy: Uhh! Uhh!

Larry: Oh, Summers, you are turning me on.

He grabs her butt cheek hard with his other hand. Buffy isn't about to

take that, and immediately flips him over hard onto the mats in front of

them. Larry groans as he lies there. Willow shoots Buffy a look as she

and Oz stand back up. The coach looks over at her also.

Oz: (points) That works, too.

Cut to the library. Giles is demonstrating the phases of the moon using

a large earth globe with a smaller moon globe attached by a bar.

Giles: And, uh, while there's absolutely no scientific explanation for

lunar effect on the human psyche, uh, the phases of the moon, uh, do

seem to exert a great deal of psychological influence. And th-the full

moon is, is, seems to bring out our darkest qualities.

Xander: And yet, ironically, uh, led to the invention of the moon pie.

Giles: (gets the joke) Oh... (chuckles) Yes, the moon pie. (laughs

harder) (gets looks from Buffy and Willow) Y-you see, uh, the-the

werewolf, uh, is such a, a potent e-e-extreme representation of our

inborn animalistic traits that it e-emerges for three full consecutive

nights: the full moon and, uh, the two nights surrounding it.

Xander: Quite the party animal.

Giles: Quite. And it, uh, acts on-on pure instinct. No conscience, uh,

uh, predatory and, and aggressive.

Buffy: In other words, your typical male.

Xander: On behalf of my gender, hey.

Giles: Yes, let's not jump to any conclusions.

Buffy: I didn't jump. I took a tiny step, and there conclusions were.

Giles: The point is that our wolfman could also be a-a-a wolfwoman, or-

or anyone who was bitten by a werewolf.

Xander: So then I'm guessing your standard silver bullets are in order

here?

Giles: No. No bullets. No matter who this werewolf is, i-it's still a

human being, who may be completely unaware of his or her condition.

Buffy: So tonight we bring 'em back alive.

Cut to that night in a secluded area of the park. The moon is full, and

several cars are parked there with couples making out. Giles walks by

some cars holding his flashlight out in front of him. Buffy meets up

with him.

Giles: (quietly) Anything yet?

Buffy: (quietly) Yes. And you won't believe what I saw. Brittany Podell

was making out with Owen Stadeel, but he goes with Barrett Williams.

(gets a look from Giles) If she ever found... No, um, no, no sign of the

werewolf. How about you?

Giles: Uh, the same. (looks around) I thought we might, uh... I thought

we might knock on a few windows, uh, ask if anyone has seen anything

yet.

Buffy: (gives him a look) Giles, no one's seen anything.

Giles: Oh, yes. No, of-of-of course not, no. Yes.

He goes off to continue looking. She stares after him a moment, and then

heads off into the bushes herself. Cut into the bushes. Buffy scans

around with her flashlight as she walks into a small clearing. Suddenly

she hears a noise like a latch releasing and yelps as she finds herself

being pulled up in a net trap. Below her a hunter points his scoped,

double-barreled flintlock up at her and pulls back the hammer.

Cain: Gotcha!

*** Part 2 ***

The park at night. Cain takes a closer look at what he's caught.

Cain: What the hell?

Buffy: (yells) Giles! Giles!

Giles: (comes running) Hey! (sees Cain with his gun) Whoa! (holds his

arms up)

Cain: Hands are good right about there.

Giles: Who, who are you? What are you doing?

Cain: The name's Cain. I'm the one with the gun, which means I'm the

one who gets to do the interviewing.

Buffy: Ahem. Hey, before we get all chummy here, how about we do

something about me being in this net thing?

Cain exhales, lowers the flintlock and leans it against a boulder. He

pulls out his buck-knife and cuts the rope holding up the net. It falls,

and Buffy hits the ground fairly hard. Giles reaches down to untangle

the net.

Giles: You alright?

Buffy: Yeah. (gets up)

Cain: (sees Buffy clearly now) Gotta say, I'm impressed.

Giles: Excuse me?

Buffy looks up at Giles, then back at Cain.

Cain: Well, it's good to get the fruit while it's fresh.

Giles: You'd be wise to take that back.

Cain: Hey, what a man and a girl do in lovers' lane at night is

nobody's busi...

Giles makes a move toward Cain, but Buffy holds him back.

Buffy: Oh, okay, hey, enough, repulsive brain. It's not what you think.

(looks at Giles) We're hunting werewolves.

Cain laughs.

Buffy: Okay, it's funny if you don't believe in werewolves.

Cain: No, it's funny thinking about you two catching one. I mean, this

guy looks like he's auditioning to be a librarian, and, you, well,

you're a girl.

Giles: I assure you she's quite capable.

Cain: Uh-huh. Lemme ask you something, sweetheart. Exactly how many of

these animals have you taken out?

Buffy: As of today?

Cain: I tore a tooth from the mouth of every werewolf that I killed.

(holds out his necklace) This next one will bring the total to an even

dozen.

Buffy: So you're just gonna kill it?

Cain: Well, see, that's the thing. Their pelts fetch a pretty penny in

Sri Lanka, and it's a little hard to skin 'em when they're alive.

Giles: Y-you hunt werewolves f-for sport?

Cain: No, no, I'm in it purely for the money.

Buffy: And it doesn't bother you that a werewolf is a person twenty-

eight days out of the month?

Cain: That's why I only hunt 'em the other three. I'd really love to

stay and chat, (crouches down to collect the net) but I'm on a tight

schedule. Any idea where else the boys and girls like to get together

around here?

Buffy: You're looking for a party?

Cain: No, but the werewolf is. They're suckers for that whole sexual

heat thing. Sense it miles away. Since this little doggie ain't here, I

guess he found another place. (stands up)

Buffy: Sorry. Wish I could help you.

Cain: But you don't know squat? (shakes his head) Gee, what a surprise.

(leaves)

Buffy turns and heads back to the car.

Giles: Where are we going?

Buffy: I think I know where to look. We just have to make it there

before mein furrier.

Cut to a street. Theresa is walking home. She passes a house with a

fenced in front yard overgrown with weeds. She hears some rustling and

stops to look around. Seeing nothing, she continues. Cut to a view of

her from the other side of the fence. The camera follows behind her. She

hears more rustling and stops to look again. Something lets out a low

growl, and Theresa decides it's time to run. She looks back again and

doesn't see Angelus in front of her. She slams into him and screams.

Angelus: Everything okay? (twirls a daisy)

Theresa: Yeah, I just, uh, I, I thought I heard something... behind me.

He walks around her to have a look, then turns back to her.

Angelus: No one there.

Theresa: Oh. I guess I was wrong. I could have sworn that...

Angelus: It's okay. It can get pretty scary out here, all alone at

night.

Theresa: Yeah.

Angelus: Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Don't you go to school

with Buffy?

Theresa: Oh, you know Buffy? (smiles)

Angelus: (chuckles) Yes, I do, very well.

Theresa: (keeps smiling) Oh.

Angelus: Come on, I'll get you home.

They walk off together, taking another quick look behind them.

Cut to the Bronze. Lotion is the band tonight. They're playing "Blind

For Now" as the camera pans from the mirrors on the far wall of the

Bronze and over to the band playing on the stage.

Lyrics: And then sweep this town into a Monster Truck of shame / Carved

out of soap and steel and clay and salty fame / You are the first to

look away and against me / You shake the squirrel out your tree

Cut to Cordelia and Willow sitting on opposite sides of a couch by a low

table.

Cordelia: I mean, with Xander it's always, 'Buffy did this', 'Willow

said that'. Buffy, Buffy. Willow, Willow. It's like I don't even exist.

(leans back and folds her arm)

Willow: I sometimes feel like that. (looks over at Cordelia)

Cordelia: And then when I call him on it, he acts all confused, like

I'm the one with the problem.

Willow: (nods) His 'do I smell something?' look.

Cordelia: All a part of his little guy games. It's like he's there, but

then he's not there, and he wants it, but then he doesn't want it.

Willow: He's so busy looking around at everything he doesn't have, he

doesn't even realize what he *does* have.

Cordelia: Well, he should at least realize that you have Oz.

Willow: (frowns and raises an eyebrow) Mm, I'm not sure I do.

(confused) Oz and I are in some sort of holding pattern, except without

the holding or... anything else.

Cordelia: What's he waiting for? What's his problem? (rolls her eyes)

Oh, that's right, he's a guy.

Willow: (disgusted) Yeah, him and Xander. Guys.

Cordelia: Who do they think they are?

Willow: A couple of guys.

Suddenly the werewolf drops down from above onto the table in front of

them. They both scream and run from the couch in opposite directions.

Panic sets in around them, and the werewolf just stands there at a half

crouch, confused by all the noise.

Cut outside to the alley. Giles and Buffy come rolling up in his

decrepit car as patrons flee for their lives.

Giles: Looks as though your hunch was right.

Buffy: Who could resist Sunnydale's own house of hormones?

She opens the door and gets out. Willow sees her and stops.

Willow: The werewolf, it's in there.

Buffy makes a dash for the door as it's about to be shut by the bouncer.

Buffy: Coming through!

She rushes through the door. Cut inside. The door is closed on her and

she looks back at it as it slams shut with a thud. She slowly steps into

the main area and looks around. The place has been trashed by the

panicked people. Tables and chairs are lying everywhere, spilled drinks

are splattered on the floor. Buffy sees a shadow behind a bead curtain

and makes for it. As she walks she takes off her backpack and pulls out

a chain. Cut to the restroom and backstage area. Buffy sees the bead

curtain that leads to the stage office swinging. She climbs the few

steps and goes in. She goes through another door to the stage. The chain

is wrapped around her forearm, ready to use against the werewolf. Slowly

she steps out onto the stage. When she's passed the drums the werewolf

comes out from behind the stage curtains, snarling. Buffy spins around

to face it and drops her backpack. She quickly unravels a length of

chain from her arms and gets ready. She throws the chain out, and it

wraps itself perfectly around the werewolf's neck. It begins to struggle

and yanks at the chain, pulling Buffy into and over the drums. The chain

falls from the werewolf's neck, and it makes a dash for a window. Cut

outside the window. The werewolf comes crashing through and out into the

alley. It takes a quick look both ways and runs away.

Cut to later. The Bronze employees are back and begin to straighten

things up. Buffy puts her chain back into her backpack as Cain watches.

Cain: You let it get away.

Buffy: I didn't let it do anything. I had the chain around its neck.

Cain: Chain? What were you gonna do, take it for a walk?

Buffy: I was going to lock it up.

Cain: That's beautiful. (approaches her) This is what happens when a

woman tries to do a man's job.

Buffy gets up and puts on the backpack as Giles comes up behind Cain.

Giles: Now, you look here, Mr. Cain. This girl risked her life trying

to capture a beast that you haven't as yet been able to find. (takes his

bag off of his shoulder)

Cain: Uh-huh. And Daddy's doing a great job carrying her bag of milk

bones.

Giles throws down his bag, but restrains himself. Cain steps closer to

Buffy.

Cain: You know, sis, if that thing out there harms anyone, it's going

to be on your pretty little head. I hope you can live with that.

Buffy: (stares him down) I live with that every day.

Cain: (shakes his head) First they tell me I can't hunt an elephant for

its ivory... (turns and leaves) Now I've gotta deal with People for the

Ethical Treatment of Werewolves.

Giles: (under his breath) Pillock! Right, let's move out.

He grabs his bag and goes. Buffy follows right behind.

Cut to a loading dock area. The werewolf walks into the light next to a

trailer and stops to sniff the air. It looks down and sees a large

splotch of blood in the gutter. It continues along the side of the

trailer. When it reaches the far end Theresa falls to the ground from

behind the trailer with a vampire bite clearly visible on her neck. The

werewolf looks down at her, but doesn't make a move to eat her. On the

other side of her Angelus steps up in his game face and growls at the

werewolf. The werewolf bares its fangs at Angelus and growls more

loudly. Angelus returns the growl, baring his own fangs and staring the

werewolf down, warning him away from Theresa's body. Angelus slowly

backs away and leaves. The werewolf looks down at Theresa again and

growls, but makes no move to touch her.

Cut to the park. Buffy comes walking up behind Giles' car.

Buffy: Giles?

When she doesn't see anyone in it she runs up to it.

Buffy: Giles!

She reaches the open window and looks in. Giles wakes and sits up.

Giles: Uhh! (takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes)

Buffy: I didn't see you there. I thought something had happened.

Giles: Oh, no, I'm, uh...

Buffy opens the passenger door and gets into the car. A newscast is

playing on the radio.

Giles: (yawns) I'm okay. I'm just, um, fine... uh, just, uh, I'm,

uh... Uh, any sign of the, uh, werewolf? (puts his glasses back on)

Buffy: No. I'm guessing you didn't see anything either from that

vantage point of having your eyes closed.

Giles: It's, uh, it's, it's, uh, gonna be light soon, so we'd better...

Buffy: Wait.

Radio newscaster: Police say that the incident was apparently connected

to the animal mutilation which occurred two nights ago. The coroner's

office has identified the body as that of Sunnydale High School student

Theresa Klusmeyer, age seventeen. The authorities ask that anyone with

further information...

Giles: Buffy, we're gonna get this thing. We have another whole night.

(Buffy looks at him) There's nothing more we can do now. It's nearly

sunrise. That werewolf won't be a werewolf much longer.

Buffy looks down sadly.

Cut to a view of Sunnydale from atop a hill. The sun is coming up in the

distance. Cut to the werewolf asleep on the ground in the woods. The

camera pans from its hind paws over to its head. When sunlight hits the

werewolf it morphs back into its human form. Oz wakes up, opens his eyes

and looks around confused. He sits up and stares around at the forest.

He looks down at himself and realizes he's naked.

Oz: (confused) Huh.

*** Part 3 ***

The dining room at Oz's house. He's on the phone with his aunt.

Oz: Aunt Maureen. Hey, it's me. Um, what? Oh! It's, uh... actually it's

healing okay. That's pretty much the reason I called. Um, I wanted to

ask you something. Is Jordy a werewolf? Uh-huh. And how long has that

been going on? Uh-huh. What? No, no reason. Um... Thanks. Yeah, love to

Uncle Ken.

He lowers the phone and turns it off. He stares off into space as the

new knowledge that he is the werewolf sinks in.

Cut to the halls at Sunnydale High. Oz walks slowly among the other

students as he makes his way to the library. He looks down and around at

everyone, still trying to deal with this new revelation about himself.

When he reaches the library he stares at the door for a long moment.

Cut inside the library. Buffy paces. Willow is sitting at the table with

Giles behind her, and Xander is leaning against the counter.

Buffy: I can't believe I let that thing get away. Cain was right. I

shoulda killed it when I had the chance.

Oz comes in, and has overheard that last comment.

Oz: Killed what?

Buffy: Uh, the, uh, (ahem) the werewolf. It-it-it was out last night.

Oz: Is everybody okay? Did anyone get bitten or, or scratched?

Willow: No, we're fine.

Oz: Gladness.

Buffy: Yeah, but he got someone. Theresa.

Oz: 'Got', as in...

Buffy just looks at him and briefly raises her eyebrows.

Oz: Oh, I'm sorry.

Buffy: And I coulda stopped it. (sits)

Giles: Well, we, we have one more night.

Oz: Another night?

Buffy: Oh, yeah. Believe me, I'm gonna give that wolfie something to

howl about.

Oz: Hmm.

Xander: (comes over) But while we hang here doing nothing, there's a

human werewolf walking around out there, probably making fun of us.

Willow: (with a hint of sarcasm) The way werewolves always do.

Oz: But there's really no way to tell who it is.

Xander: Oh, sure there is. Giles knows stuff, and I'm practically an

expert on the subject.

Willow: On account of once you were a hyena?

Xander: I know what it's like to crave the taste of freshly killed

meat, to be taken over by those uncontrollable urges.

Buffy: You said you didn't remember anything about that.

Xander: (chuckles) I said I didn't remember anything about that. Look,

the point is, is I have an affinity with this thing. I can get inside of

its head. (closes his eyes and begins to *be* the werewolf) I'm a big,

bad wolf. I'm on the prowl. (sniffs) I'm sniffing, I'm snarling, I'm a

slobbering predator, I'm... (opens his eyes) Wait a second! It's right

in front of us. (Oz's eye go wide with the fear of being recognized)

It's obvious who I am. I'm Larry! (Oz breathes a sigh of relief) The

guy's practically got wolf-boy stamped on his forehead. You got the dog

bite, you got the aggression, not to mention the excessive back hair.

Buffy: And he was awfully gleeful about tormenting Theresa.

Giles: Still, that doesn't necessarily mean that...

Xander: I'm gonna go talk to him. Gonna force a confession out of him.

(leaves)

Giles: Good. Go. Uh, in the meantime, we need to cover our bases.

Willow, um, check the student files. See if anybody else fits the

profile. Uh, Buffy?

Buffy: Where are we going?

Giles: I-if none of that works, I think I may have an alternative.

(goes into his office)

Buffy: Yeah, me and the werewolf alone in a cage for three minutes.

That's all I ask. (gets up and follows Giles)

Willow: (to Oz) Are you okay?

Oz: (comes back to earth) What?

Willow: You kind of knew Theresa.

Oz: Oh, yeah, I, uh, I'm trying not to think about it. It's... it's a

lot.

Willow: It is. But we can do stuff to help. Sometimes it feels good to

help.

Oz: Uh-huh.

Buffy comes back to the office door, but holds back, not wanting to

interrupt Willow with Oz.

Willow: Well, like... looking up stuff. I'm gonna be doing that most of

the night. You could help me, help together?

Oz: (unsure what to do) I can't. Um, uh, I'm busy.

Willow: Oh. So...

Oz: I... I gotta go.

He jogs out of the library. Willow watches him go, confused about his

behavior. Buffy looks sadly at her friend from the office doorway.

Cut to the boys' locker room. The camera pans over to the sinks where

Larry is splashing some water onto his face. He grabs a towel and dries

off as he heads for his gym locker. Xander is there waiting for him and

kicks his locker closed to get his attention. Larry takes the towel from

his face and looks at Xander, startled.

Larry: Harris. Sheesh. Next time wear a bell. (opens his locker)

Xander: Why so jumpy, Larry?

Larry: Geeks make me nervous.

Xander: Is that really it or is there something you're hiding?

Larry: (leans on his locker door) I could hide my fist in your face.

Xander: I know your secret, big guy. I know what you've been doing at

night.

Larry: You know, Harris, that nosey little nose of yours is going to

get you into trouble someday... (grabs Xander by the shirt) Like today.

Xander: Hurting me isn't gonna make this go away. People are still

gonna find out.

Larry: (lets go) Alright. What do you want? Hush money? Is that what

you're after?

Xander: I don't *want* anything! I just wanna help!

Larry: What, you think you have a cure?

Xander: No, it's just... I know what you're going through because I've

been there. That's why I know you should talk about it.

Larry: Yeah, that's easy for *you* to say. I mean, you're nobody. I've

got a reputation here.

Xander: Larry, please, before someone else gets hurt.

Larry: (points at Xander's chest) Look, if this gets out, it's over for

me. (turns and takes a few paces away) I mean, forget about playing

football. They'll run me outta this town. I mean, come on! How are

people going to look at me (faces Xander) after they find out I'm gay.

Xander looks at him in astonishment. Larry looks like a heavy burden has

just been lifted and smiles.

Larry: Oh, wow. I said it. And it felt... okay. (whispers) I'm gay.

(approaches Xander) I am gay.

Xander: I heard you the first time.

Larry: I can't believe it. It was almost easy. I never felt I could

tell anyone. (gestures to Xander) And then you, you of all people, you

bring it outta me.

Xander: It probably would have slipped out even if I wasn't here.

Larry: (leans on his locker door) No, no, because knowing you went

through the same thing, made it easier for me to admit it.

Xander: (wide-eyed) The same thing...

Larry: (puts his arm around Xander) It's ironic. I mean, all those

times I beat the crap out of you, it musta been because I recognized

something in you that I didn't want to believe about myself.

Xander: (laughs nervously) Larry, no, I am not...

Larry: Of course, of course not. Don't worry. (pats Xander on the

shoulder) I wouldn't do that to you. Your secret's safe with me.

He gives Xander a thumbs-up and smiles.

Larry: (to himself) Wow.

He drapes the towel around his neck, closes his gym locker and walks

off. Xander stares after him in disbelief.

Cut to the library. Willow is 'Net surfing on her laptop. Buffy comes

out of Giles' office and goes over to her.

Buffy: So what's the scuttlebutt? Anybody besides Larry fit our

werewolf profile? (sits on the table)

Willow: There is one name that keeps getting spit out. Aggressive

behavior, run-ins with authorities, about a screenful of violent

incidents.

Buffy: Okay, most of those were not my fault. Somebody else started

'em. I was just standing up for myself.

Willow: (looks up at Buffy) They say it's a good idea to count to ten

when you're angry.

Buffy: One... Two... Three...

Willow: (looks back at her laptop) I'll keep looking. (goes back to

work)

Buffy: I, um... noticed you were looking solo.

Willow: Yeah. Oz wanted to be someplace that was (looks up at Buffy)

away... from me.

Buffy: I'm sorry.

Willow: (leans back in her chair) I can't figure him out. I mean, he's

so hot and cold. Or luke-warm and cold.

Buffy: Welcome to the mystery that is men. I think it goes something

like, they grow body hair, they lose all ability to tell you what they

really want.

Willow: It doesn't seem like a fair trade. (stands up and puts her

laptop in its case)

Buffy: Well, if you wanna up the speed quotient with Oz, maybe you need

to do something daring. Maybe you need to make the first move.

She slides off of the table, and Willow follows her as she gets her

stuff for class.

Willow: Well, that won't make me a slut?

Buffy: I think your reputation will remain intact.

Cut to the hall. Willow and Buffy come out of the library.

Willow: It used to be so much easier to tell if a boy liked you. He'd

punch you on the arm and then run back to his friends.

Buffy: Those were the days.

Xander: (comes up to them) Hey.

They stop. He taps Buffy on the arm. She looks up at him.

Willow: I'll see you guys later. (Buffy looks at her) Cordelia asked me

to look over her history homework before class. I think that means I

might have to *do* it. (goes off)

Xander: Wow, those two gals are hanging out a lot together. This would

be a good time to panic.

Buffy lets out a laugh. They start down the hall.

Buffy: So how'd it go with Larry?

Xander: What's that supposed to mean?

Buffy: I think it's supposed to mean, 'so how'd it go with Larry'?

She stops at her locker and reaches for the combination lock.

Xander: He's not the werewolf. Can't we just leave it at that? Must you

continue to *push* and *push*?

Buffy: (opens her locker) I'm sorry. I was just wondering. (takes off

her pack)

Xander: Well, he's not.

Buffy: Okay.

Xander: Okay.

Buffy: But there goes our lead suspect. (sticks her pack in her locker)

Which then puts us right back at (closes the locker) square boned.

Xander: You're not boned, you're Buffy. Eradicator of evil. Defender

of, um... things that need defending.

Buffy: Tell that to Theresa. She could have used my defending before

she was ripped apart by that... (stops and considers)

Xander: Werewolf.

Buffy: Nowhere in any of the reports did it say anything about her

being mauled. (looks up at Xander) I mean, they were linked to the

animal attacks from the other night, so we just assumed werewolf.

Xander: What else should we have assumed?

Cut to the funeral home. Theresa is laid out in her coffin with a scarf

around her neck. Buffy pulls it back and sees the bite.

Buffy: Vampire.

Xander: So that's good, right? I mean in the sense of the werewolf

didn't get her, and... (gets a look from Buffy) No. There is no good

here.

Buffy: No good. Instead of not protecting Theresa from the werewolf,

(goes over to the guest register) I was able to not protect her from

something just as bad. (looks at all the signatures) She had a lot of

friends. (takes the pen to add her own)

Xander: Buffy, you can't blame yourself for every death that happens in

Sunnydale. If it weren't for you people'd be lined up five deep waitin'

to get themselves buried. Willow would be Robbie the Robot's love slave,

I wouldn't even have a head, (looks at the coffin) and Theresa's a

vampire.

Theresa sits up, looks over at them and growls. Buffy turns around and

sees her hop out of the coffin. She lunges at Theresa, grabs her and

tries to wrestle her to the floor, but Theresa throws her down instead.

She dives after Buffy and tries to pin her, but Buffy rolls her over and

gets on top. She makes a quick grab for a wooden easel holding a flower

wreath and breaks off a leg. She's about to thrust it into Theresa's

chest when she speaks.

Theresa: Angel sends his love.

Buffy is caught off guard by that and hesitates a moment. Theresa kicks

Buffy's arm and sends the stick flying away. She grabs Buffy by the

shoulders, wrestles her onto her back and pins her. Buffy struggles to

keep her at bay. Behind her Xander has grabbed the easel and jams one of

its legs through Theresa's back. She bursts into ashes. Buffy stares up

at Xander. He tosses the easel aside and looks down at her. Buffy looks

aside sadly and then rolls over.

Buffy: (to herself) Angel. (gets to her knees)

Xander: (leans down to her) Are you okay?

Buffy: (takes his hand) This isn't happening. (pulls herself up and

hugs Xander) He's gonna keep coming after me.

Xander: (hugs back gently) Don't let him get to you. He's not the same

guy you knew.

She pulls back a bit and looks up at him. He looks back kindly. She lets

go, picks up her backpack and goes out. Xander stares after her.

Xander: Oh, no, my life's not too complicated.

He shakes his head and follows her out.

Cut to the woods. Cain's van is parked with the curtains drawn across

the cab. Cut inside the van. It's set up like a small hunter's lodge,

with hunting equipment and traps hanging from the walls and a lab bench

full of reloading equipment. He reaches down, picks up a small iron pan

and sets it on the bench. He has a Bunsen burner going. He takes a small

long-handled melting cup and holds it over the flame. When the metal in

the cup has become molten he brings it over to a mold that he's holding

over the iron pan with his other hand and pours the silver into it. He

sets the melting cup aside and breaks open the mold. Inside is a

perfectly formed bullet. He holds it up to inspect it in the dim light.

Cut to a shot of the full moon rising.

Cut to Oz's dining room. He has a box full of shackles and locks and

dumps them out. He looks at them and considers a moment, then with a

strengthened resolve starts to put one on. He's about to put the lock on

when there's a knocking at the door. He ignores it and looks at the

lock. As he moves to put it on there's another knock on the door. He

looks at it in frustration and sets the lock and shackles down. The

knocking continues insistently as he goes over to the door. When he

opens it he finds an irate Willow standing there, ready to knock even

more.

Oz: Willow! What are you doing?

She pushes her way inside.

Willow: I had this whole thing worked out. (goes toward the dining

room) And I had it written down, uh, but then it didn't make any sense

(turns to face him) when I was reading it back.

Oz: Willow, this is not a very good time.

Willow: I mean, what am I supposed to think? First, you buy me popcorn

(paces away) and then you're all glad that I didn't get bit. (paces

back) (softly) And you put the tag back in my shirt. (harshly) But I

guess none of that means anything because instead of looking up names

with me, here you are all alone in your house doing nothing by yourself.

Oz: Willow, we'll talk about this tomorrow. I promise.

He tries to take hold of her to lead her out, but she shakes him off.

Willow: No, damn it! We'll talk about this now! Buffy told me that

sometimes what a girl makes has to be the first move and now that I'm

saying this, I'm starting to think that the written version sounded

pretty good, but you know what I mean.

Oz: I know, I know, it's me. I'm, I'm goin' through some... changes.

Willow: Well, welcome to the world! Things happen. Don't you think I'm

going through a lot?

Oz: Not like me.

Willow: Oh, what, so now you're special? (paces away into the dining

room) You're special boy... (sees the shackles) With chains and stuff.

Why do you have chains and stuff?

Oz doubles over in pain and hugs his chest.

Oz: Willow, please! (heads for the door) Get outta here!

She stares at him confused. He falls behind the couch out of her view.

There he begins to rapidly grow hair and mutate into a werewolf.

Willow: Oz? Oz, what is it?

She slowly approaches the couch. Oz's fingers grow longer and hairier.

Willow: What's wrong?

She hears Oz moaning in pain. She looks carefully over the couch, and Oz

the werewolf leaps to his feet and growls at her. She screams and jumps

backward away from him.

*** Part 4 ***

Oz's living room. Willow screams and starts to run through the dining

room. Oz the werewolf gives chase. She runs down the hall and out a back

door.

Cut to the streets. Willow runs. The werewolf comes around the corner

chasing after her. She goes up to a wooden fence, hops up and tries to

pull herself over. She's not quite fast enough and only has one leg over

when the werewolf catches up. It makes a grab for her leg, but misses as

she drops over the other side and manages to land in a crouch on her

feet. She sees a couple of metal trashcans there, grabs one and smashes

it into the werewolf's face as it tries to climb over after her.

Cut to the street. Cain's van rolls slowly along. He looks up and sees

the werewolf trying to get over the fence.

Cain: There you are.

He pulls the van over to the side.

Cut to the library. Giles opens a guncase, undoes the straps and pulls

out the stock. He grabs the barrel and scope assembly and clicks them

into place. Buffy comes walking up behind him.

Buffy: Sorry I'm late. I had to do some unscheduled slayage in the form

of Theresa.

He stops his assembling to look at her.

Giles: She's a vampire?

Buffy: Was. Angel sent her to me. A little token of his affection.

Giles: Buffy, I'm so sorry.

Buffy: (holds up her hand) Not now, Giles. We can all have ourselves a

good cry after we bag us a werewolf.

He plugs in the laser sight and holds the tranquilizer gun up to check

the scope.

Cut to the woods. Willow runs quickly through the trees with the

werewolf not far behind. She hops over a log, but then trips and falls

to the ground. She rolls to face the werewolf and looks at it in terror.

It doesn't attack, but instead sniffs the air. It looks around for the

direction of the scent and rushes off. Willow quickly gets to her feet

and runs the other way.

Cut to the library. Giles checks the trigger mechanism of the gun.

Giles: All set. (grabs a dart) Let's go find this thing. (starts out)

Buffy: One question: how exactly do we find this thing?

Willow comes barging into the library.

Willow: It's Oz! It's Oz!

Buffy: Wh-what's Oz?

Willow: The werewolf.

Giles: Are you certain?

Willow: (frantic) Can't you just trust me on this? He-he said he was

going through all these changes. Then he went through all these...

changes.

Buffy: Where is he now?

Willow: In the woods.

Giles: Let's go. (starts out again)

Willow: (grabs and stops him) Go where? You're not gonna kill Oz! Yeah,

he's a werewolf, but he doesn't mean to be.

Buffy: Don't worry, Willow. We're not going to hurt him.

They all start out of the library.

Giles: I put enough Phenobarbital in this thing to sink a small

elephant. It should be enough for a large werewolf.

He grabs his coat from the counter and holds the door open for the

girls.

Cut to the woods. The werewolf has found what it's looking for. So has

Cain, and he cocks his flintlock's hammer back and lifts it to his

shoulder. The werewolf gets closer to the pile of meat Cain has left out

for him.

Cain: That's it. Let me see you. Come on, suppertime.

The werewolf is on top of the bait now, and Cain takes aim.

Cain: Good, doggy. Now play dead.

He is about to pull he trigger when he gets kicked from the side. He

falls to the ground, and his gun fires wild. The werewolf looks up from

its meal at the commotion. Buffy grabs Cain's gun and wrestles him for

it. She flips the rifle over and he follows, landing on his back and

letting go of the gun in the process. As he tries to get up Buffy swings

the butt of the rifle around and knocks him down and out. The werewolf

comes at her, and she ducks his lunge. Giles and Willow arrive to see

the werewolf grab Buffy and lift her off of her feet. She pushes him

back using Cain's gun to keep from being bitten. Giles tries to get a

clear shot, but the werewolf turns and holds Buffy up between them.

Willow: Careful!

Giles: (can't get a shot) Damn it!

He keeps looking for an opening, but is quickly getting frustrated.

Buffy raises the rifle high and smashes it down on the werewolf's head.

It drops her and falls back stunned. It quickly gets up and swipes at

her, knocking the gun from her hands. Then the werewolf shoves Buffy

away and right into Giles and Willow, bowling them over. It starts to

come at them. Willow scrambles for the tranquilizer gun and brings it up

to bear. The werewolf charges, and Willow pulls the trigger. The dart

hits it in the chest, and it staggers backward a bit before falling over

unconscious.

Willow: (looks up at Giles) I shot Oz.

Giles: You saved us.

He takes the gun from Willow. Buffy walks over to get Cain's gun. He

gets to his feet and straightens his coat.

Cain: No wonder this town's overrun with monsters. No one here's man

enough to kill 'em.

Buffy: Oh, I wouldn't be too sure of that.

Cain turns to see her with his flintlock. She grabs the end of the

barrel and bends it into a nice arc right in front of him and then

thrusts it at him. He looks at her in astonishment.

Buffy: How about you let the door hit you in the ass on the way out of

town?

Cain makes a move to go but stops to give her another look. She stares

back at him, and then he leaves. She looks down at Willow crouched next

to Oz the werewolf and gets down with her.

Willow: You think it'll be okay?

They both look up at Giles.

Giles: He'll be a little sore in the morning, but... he'll be Oz.

Cut to Sunnydale High the next day. Cut to the halls. Xander and Buffy

walk past the trophy case and into the lounge.

Xander: This is all so weird. I mean, how are we supposed to act when

we see him?

Buffy: Well, it's gotta be weird for him, too. Now that we know so

much.

Xander: All I know is I'll never be able to look at him the same again.

Buffy: He's still a human being. Most of the time.

They stop at the vending machine.

Xander: Who are we talking about?

Buffy: Oz. Who are you talking about?

Xander: No one.

He sees Larry's jock friends by the stairs knocking a girl's books out

of her hands and laughing. Larry comes down the stairs behind her and

quickly reaches down to help her pick up her books.

Larry: Hey, let me get those.

Girl: Thanks.

His friends give him a surprised look. So does Buffy. Larry comes over

to them.

Larry: Hey! Xander. Look, about what you did. I, I owe you.

Buffy: What'd you do?

Xander: It's really nothing we should be talking about. (to Larry)

Ever.

Larry: I know, I know. It's just, well, (pats him on the arm) thanks.

(walks off)

Buffy: That was weird.

They go to a table and sit.

Xander: What, it's not okay for one guy to like another guy just

because he happened to be in the locker room with him when absolutely

nothing happened and I thought I told you not to push.

Buffy: All I meant is that he didn't try to look up my skirt.

Xander: (fidgets with is hands) Oh, oh, yeah, that's, that's the

weirdness. (smiles nervously)

Buffy: Weirdness abounds lately. Maybe it's the moon. That does stuff

to people.

Xander: I've heard that.

Buffy: (sees Willow walk by) Certainly gonna put a strain on Willow and

Oz's relationship.

Xander: What relationship? I mean, what life could they possibly have

together? (counts off on his fingers) We're talking obedience school,

paper training, Oz is always in back burying their things, and that kind

of breed can turn on its owner.

Buffy: I don't know. I kinda see Oz as the loyal type.

Xander: All I'm saying is she's not safe with him. If it were up to

me...

Buffy: (interrupts) Xander...

Cut outside to Willow walking over to Oz sitting on a table.

Buffy: It's not up to you.

Willow: Hey.

Oz: Hey.

Willow: Did you want to go first?

Oz: I spoke to Giles. He said I'll be okay. I just have to lock myself

up around the full moon. Only he used more words than that. And a globe.

Willow: I'm sorry about how all this ended up. With me shooting you and

all.

Oz: It's okay. I'm, I'm sorry I almost ate you.

Willow: It's okay. I kind of thought you would have told me.

Oz: I didn't know what to say. I mean, it's not everyday you find out

you're a werewolf. That's fairly freaksome. It may take a couple days

getting used to.

Willow: Yeah. It's a complication.

Oz: So... (hops off of the table and they walk) Maybe it'd be best if I

just... sorta...

Willow: What?

Oz: Well, you know, like, stayed out of your way for awhile.

Willow: I don't know. I'm kind of okay with you being *in* my way.

Oz: (stops and faces her) You mean, you'd still...

Willow: Well, I like you. You're nice and you're funny. And you don't

smoke. Yeah, okay, werewolf, but that's not all the time. I mean, three

days out of the month I'm not much fun to be around either.

Oz: You are quite the human.

Willow: (smiles) So, I'd still if you'd still.

Oz: I'd still. I'd *very* still.

Willow: (smiles widely) Okay. (more seriously) No biting, though.

Oz: Agreed.

Willow walks off with a smile on her face. Oz turns around and watches

her go. He smiles. Then he looks surprised to see her rushing back. She

looks at him for an instant and then plants a kiss right on his lips. He

watches her with a smile as she goes off again.

Oz: A werewolf in love.
