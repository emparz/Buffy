A town square in Galway, Ireland, 1753. The camera looks straight down

from above onto the cobblestones. A lone rider on his horse passes

underneath, and the camera follows them past a well as Angelus narrates.

Angelus: There's moments in your life that make you, that set the

course of who you're gonna be. Sometimes they're little, subtle moments.

Sometimes... they're not. I'll show you what I mean.

The horseman continues past a tavern on the far side of the square. The

door opens, and a young drunk Angel and his drunk friend are thrown out.

Angel: (with an Irish accent) We'll be back when we've found a bit more

cash money! Keep the girls warm!

The tavern proprietor slams the door shut, and Angel pounds on it a

couple of times.

Angel's friend: (moans) Let's go.

Angel staggers back over to him and puts his arm around him. They begin

to walk with a definite sway in their step.

Angel: Come on. We'll sneak in and take some of me father's silver.

He'll never miss it. He eats with his hands, the pig.

His friend is too drunk to go on, and faints dead away, falling out of

Angel's arm to the pavement. Angel looks down at him.

Angel: Ah. Why don't you rest right here.

He takes a look around and spots a noble lady in a fancy period dress

standing in an alley beyond an archway. The woman gives a slight

backward glance to be sure she has his attention, and starts to walk

further into the alley, disappearing around a corner from Angel's view.

He follows her.

Cut to the alley. The woman continues her slow pace and looks up when

Angel comes through the archway and begins to speak. As she gets closer

to the camera it becomes clear that the woman is Darla. Her long curly

blonde hair is very nicely coiffed.

Angel: So, I'd ask myself... What's a lady of your station doing alone

in an alley with the reputation that this one has?

Darla: (still facing away) Maybe she's lonely.

Angel: In that case, I'd offer myself as escort to protect you from

harm and to while away the dull hours.

Darla: You're very gracious.

Angel: Hm. It's often been said.

Darla: (turns to face him) Are you certain you're up to the challenge?

Angel: (approaches her) Milady, you'll find that with the exception of

an honest day's work, there's no challenge I'm not prepared to face.

He stops in front of her and looks into her eyes.

Angel: Oh... But you're a pretty thing. Where are you from?

Darla: (smiles) Around. Everywhere.

Angel: I never been anywhere myself. Always wanted to see the world,

but...

Darla: I could show you. (smiles)

Angel: Could you, then?

Darla: Things you've never seen, never even heard of.

Angel: Sounds exciting.

Darla: It is. And frightening.

Angel: I'm not afraid. Show me. Show me your world.

Darla: (closes her eyes) Close your eyes.

Angel follows her example. The camera follows her hand as she puts it on

his shoulder, and continues up to show her face vamped out. She smiles,

lets out a low growl and opens wide as she leans in to bite him. When he

feels the pain his eyes open wide, and he gasps. He can't keep steady,

and sinks to his knees. Darla lets go of her bite, revealing his bloody

neck, and stands up straight. She lifts her hand to her chest and draws

a sharp fingernail across the skin above her breasts, allowing blood to

trickle out. She grabs him by the back of the neck and pulls him in to

her bosom so that his lips fall directly onto the cut, forcing him to

taste of her blood. He puts his arms around her and drinks.

Cut to the cemetery in Sunnydale, 1998. Angelus walks through carefully

and quietly while watching Buffy fight a pair of vampires nearby. He

sees her kick one and then the other, and then continues on to a better

vantage point. One of the vampires rushes Buffy, and she flips him over

onto his back.

Buffy: Nice try.

The other one comes at her again with a swing. She ducks it and punches

him in the face, in the gut and again in the face. He falls to the

ground, dazed. The first one comes at her again with a kick, but she

blocks it with her arm, backhand punches him in the face, jabs him in

the gut and grabs his arm, twisting it up high and forcing him to his

knees in pain. Angelus looks on from behind a tree and smiles. The

second vampire gets back up and rushes her. Without letting go of the

first one she cleanly jams her stake into the other one's chest, and he

crumbles into ashes. Angelus can't help but snicker. Buffy turns her

attention back to the one she's holding and punches him in the face,

making him roll away.

Buffy: I want you to get a message to Angel for me. Tell him I'm done

waiting. I'm taking the fight to him.

Angelus smiles as he listens.

Buffy: You got that? Need me to write it down for you?

The vampire gets up and charges her. She grabs him and pulls him around

and down to the ground, and immediately plunges her stake home. He

bursts into ashes.

Buffy: Alright, I'll tell him myself.

She gets up and walks over behind a gravestone, where she reaches down

to help someone up.

Xander: (moans) I'm good. Don't worry about me. (rubs his neck)

Buffy: You know, you don't have to patrol with me.

Xander: (indicates the pile of ash) I had that guy under control until

he resorted to fisticuffs. (cranes his neck) Oh! What is that, um...

five vampires in three nights?

Buffy: Yep. But no Angel.

Xander: Are you, uh, really that anxious to come up against him?

Buffy: I want it over with.

Xander: (nods) I hear that.

Buffy: Oh, we better go. (exhales) I haven't even started studying for

finals yet. (starts to go)

Xander: (joins her) Oh, yeah, finals! Why didn't you let me die?

Buffy: Ah, look on the bright side. It'll all be over soon.

They leave the cemetery under the watchful eyes of Angelus.

Angelus: Yes, my love. It will.

He smirks and turns to leave the other way.

Opening credits roll. Buffy's theme plays.

*** Part 1 ***

The research lab at the Sunnydale Museum of Natural History. The camera

pans across a large rectangular chunk of rock over to a technician. She

is carefully cleaning off a section of the rock. She lets a jet of

compressed air blow away some dust. A moment later she lets another jet

go, and then reaches up with a brush and runs it across the rock. Dr.

Doug Perren, one of the museum curators, comes over to check her

progress.

Doug: Careful, now. (points) Concentrate in this area. (watches her

work a moment) There you go.

The door opens behind him, and he turns to see Giles come in.

Giles: Hello?

Doug: (comes to greet him) Rupert Giles?

Giles: Yes.

Doug: Doug Perren. (shakes his hand) Thanks for coming.

Giles: Oh, not at all. It's... flattered to be asked.

Doug: I spoke with Lou Tabor at the Washington Institute, and he told

me we had the best authority on obscure relics right here in Sunnydale.

Giles: Oh... (laughs) He may have, uh, exaggerated a little. (sees the

obelisk) Ah, is this the...

Doug: This is our baby. (they approach it) Construction workers dug it

up outside of town. Don't have a clue what it is. Any ideas?

Giles: (touches and looks at the rock) A few. None I'd care to share

until I can verify. (notices the runes on it) You have, uh, carbon dated

it? (inspects the writings)

Doug: The results'll be back in a couple of days. I'll go out on a limb

and say old.

Giles: (smirks) Um, yes, it, it certainly... (picks up a jar and a

scraper) predates any, uh... settlements we've read about. (points) Um,

may, may I?

Doug: Yeah. Sure.

Giles leans in and begins to scrape at the corner of the obelisk,

catching the debris in the jar. He digs into an apparent groove. A few

scrapes later he stops and taps the scraper clean on the jar.

Giles: I assume you've, uh, you haven't tried to open it.

Doug: Open it?

He leans over to see what Giles has discovered.

Doug: Ah, I'll be damned. I figured it was solid. What do you think is

in there?

Giles: (staring intently) I don't know.

Doug: Well... I guess we won't know until we open it up.

Giles: (considers) Yes, but could I ask, um... would you wait? I, uh...

I'd like to work on translating the text. It-it-it might give us an

indication of... what we'll find inside.

Doug: You don't want to be surprised?

Giles: A-as a rule, no.

Doug: Alright. You're the expert. But I'm pretty damn curious, though.

Giles: (removes his glasses) Yes. Yes, so am I.

Cut to the cafeteria at Sunnydale High. The camera focuses on two fish

sticks that Xander is holding, one with a toothpick stuck through the

middle. He plays with them like puppets, moving the one with the

toothpick around.

Xander: Tell Angel I'm gonna kill him! No, wait. I'm gonna kill you!

He starts to repeatedly stab the toothpick into the other fish stick.

The camera pulls back and up to his face.

Xander: Die! Die! Die!

He makes an anguished face and lets the fish stick fall.

Xander: Aah! (makes a thudding noise) (squeals) Mother! (smiles)

Cordelia: Is that it?

Xander: Yeah. That's it. (chuckles) Scene! (grins)

Cut to Willow, Oz and Buffy at the opposite side of the table. Willow is

sitting on Oz's lap.

Buffy: That's exactly how it happened.

Oz: Well, I thought it was riveting. Uh, I was a little unclear about

some of the themes.

Buffy: The theme is Angel's too much of a coward to take me on face-to-

face.

Xander: (still playing with the fish sticks) And the other theme was

'Buy American', but it, uh, got kind of buried.

Willow: (to Buffy) Do you think you're ready to fight Angel?

Buffy: I wish people would stop asking me that. Yes, I'm ready. I'm

also willing and able. Just the one test I might actually pass.

Willow: Don't say that! You're gonna pass everything. I will get you

through this semester if I have to sweat blood.

Xander: Do you think you're likely to? 'Cause I'd like to be elsewhere.

Willow: It was only metaphor blood.

Oz: I think you'd sweat cute blood.

Willow: (gives Oz a smile) (to Buffy) Sixth period, after my computer

class, we'll rock on chemistry.

Buffy: Ready to rock.

Cordelia: Boy, Willow, you've really got the teaching bug: taking over

computer class, tutoring...

Willow: (smiles widely) I love it. I really do.

Cordelia: I think it's great to do that before you go out and fail in

the real world. That way you're not falling back on something. You're

falling... well, forward.

Xander: (rolls his eyes) And almost sixty-five percent of that was

actual compliment. Is that a personal best?

Cordelia: Gee, Xander, what are you gonna teach when you fail in life?

Advanced loser-being?

Xander: I will teach... (with a French accent) zee Language of Love!

(reaches for her)

Cordelia: (fights him off) Don't touch me! You have fish hands!

Snyder comes into the cafeteria behind them.

Xander: Come, let me caress you!

Cordelia: Stop it!

Xander: Let me in!

Cordelia: No! (laughs) Don't!

Snyder: That's enough of that. (to Willow) And you! Are we having a

chair shortage?

Willow: I didn't read anything about... Oh. (slides off of Oz's lap and

into her chair) I get it.

Snyder: These public displays of affection are not acceptable in my

school. This isn't an orgy, people. It's a classroom.

Buffy: Yeah! Where they teach lunch.

Snyder: (glares at her) Just give me a reason to kick you out, Summers.

Just give me a reason. (walks off)

Cordelia: How about because you're a tiny, impotent Nazi with a bug up

his butt the size of an emu?

Buffy: Sums it up.

Cordelia: Don't you think?

Willow: (smiles) (to Buffy) Do you wanna come by my house tonight and

study, too?

Buffy: Maybe. I-I do have to patrol.

Willow: Again? Do you really expect Angel to turn up tonight?

Buffy: No, I don't expect him to. But that's usually when he does.

Cut to an abbey in London, 1860. Cut inside the nave. Monks are

chanting. Drusilla walks behind the pews toward the confession booths.

Before going in she faces the altar, kneels and crosses herself. She

looks up briefly before getting back to her feet and going into one of

the booths. As she steps in through the curtain an arm juts out of the

adjacent one where the priest waits, and muffled noises and struggling

can be heard. The arm gets pulled back in as quickly as it appeared. Cut

inside the confessional. Drusilla sits down and pulls the scarf from her

head.

Drusilla: Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

In the next booth Angelus is caught by surprise, and drops the dead

priest.

Drusilla: It's been two days since my last confession. (waits for an

answer) Father?

Angelus: (goes along with it) That's not very long.

Drusilla: (with a trembling voice) Oh, Father, I'm so afraid.

Angelus: The Lord is very forgiving. Tell me your sins.

Drusilla: I had... (breathes deeply) I've been seeing again, Father.

Yesterday, the men were going to work in the mine. I had... (shakes) a

terrible fright. (draws a frightened breath) My stomach all (draws

another) tied up, and I saw this horrible... crash. (calms a bit) My

mummy said to keep my peace, it didn't mean nothing. But this morning...

they had a cave-in. Two men died.

Angelus: Go on.

Drusilla: Me mum says... I'm cursed. (exhales) My seeing things is an

affront to the Lord, (inhales sharply) that only he's supposed to see

anything before it happens. (inhales, sobs) But I don't mean to, Father,

I swear! (inhales) I swear! (begins to cry) I try to be pure in his

sight. (sobs) I don't want to be an evil thing.

Angelus: Oh, hush, child. The Lord has a plan for all creatures. Even a

Devil child like you.

Drusilla: (taken aback) A Devil?

Angelus: Yes! You're a spawn of Satan. All the Hail Marys in the world

aren't going to help. The Lord will use you and smite you down. He's

like that.

Drusilla: (frightened) What can I do?

Angelus: Fulfill his plan, child. Be evil. Just give in.

Drusilla: No! (sobs) I want to be good. (sobs) I want to be pure.

Angelus: We all do, at first. The world doesn't work that way.

Drusilla: Father... I beg you... Please... Please, help me.

Angelus: Very well. Ten Our Fathers and an Act of Contrition. Does that

sound good?

Drusilla: (relieved) Yes. (exhales) Yes, Father. Thank you.

Angelus: The pleasure was mine. And my child... (raises his hand to the

lattice between them)

Drusilla: Yes?

Angelus: (stares at her) God is watching you.

Cut to the atrium at Angelus' mansion, 1998. Drusilla comes down the

stairs to the garden below. There Spike sits in his wheelchair and reads

the newspaper.

Spike: Nice walk, pet?

Drusilla: (holds her tummy as though sick) I met an old man. Didn't

like him. He got stuck in my teeth. (licks her fingers) (faces Spike)

But then the Moon started whispering to me... (closes her eyes and leans

her head back) All sorts of dreadful things.

Angelus walks into the Garden behind Spike.

Angelus: Well, what did it say?

Spike: Oh. Look who's awake.

Angelus bumps Spike's head with his fist as he walks past him.

Angelus: What did the Moon tell you? (walks around Dru) Did you have a

vision? Is something coming?

Drusilla: Oh, yeah. (whispers) Something terrible. Psst, psst, psst,

psst, psst, psst...

Angelus: Where?

Drusilla: At the museum. A tomb... (smiles) with a surprise inside.

Angelus: (holds his hand up to her head) You can see all that in your

head?

Spike: No, you ninny. She read it in the morning paper. (hands over the

paper)

Angelus: (takes the paper and looks) Oh, my.

The headline of the Sunnydale Press reads 'Mysterious Obelisk

Unearthed'. The article's subtitle reads 'Excavators Discover Ancient

Artifact'.

Drusilla: That's what's been whispering to me. Sh.

Angelus: Oh, yeah. (to Drusilla) Don't worry, though. Soon it'll stop.

(to Spike) Soon it'll scream.

He smiles over at Spike. Drusilla waves her head around open-mouthed and

playfully snaps at Angelus' cheek.

Cut to the computer science classroom after school. Willow is tutoring

Buffy in chemistry. Buffy gives up in frustration and slaps down her

pencil.

Buffy: Waah! This doesn't make any sense. (pouts at Willow)

Willow: Well, sure it does. See... (takes the paper and looks) Oh, no,

this doesn't make any sense.

Buffy: (shrugs) It's senseless. (plays with her pencil)

Willow: (encouragingly) It is, but at least you know that, so you're

learning. (looks at the problem more closely)

Buffy: Yay me. Well, it doesn't matter anyway. I mean, when in the real

world am I ever gonna need chemistry or history or math or the English

language?

Willow: (shoots Buffy a glance) Okay. I see your problem.

Buffy: I'm a moron?

Willow: (gives Buffy a look) Will you stop that? You're not stupid!

You've just had a lot on your mind. You can learn this real easily, but

if you're just gonna give up, then don't waste my time.

Buffy: (impressed) Wow. You really *are* a good teacher. (smiles)

Willow: Okay. Look at this. A covalent bond, which means these two

atoms are linked by this...

Buffy puts her pencil down on her open book, and it rolls off of the

desk and into the space between it and the filing cabinet next to it.

Buffy: Ohh! (moans) Hold that thought.

She reaches down and in with her fingers, and pulls the pencil out. In

the process she bumps the disk with the pencil so it now leans against

the desk instead of the cabinet.

Buffy: (sits back up) Okay. I'm Learn Girl.

Willow: Okay. (points to the paper) So, see here...

Buffy: (has an epiphany) Deja vu.

Willow: Really?

Buffy: Yeah. I have this perfect memory of the pencil and...

She drops the pencil onto her book again. It rolls off of the desk

again, falls and hits the disk. She looks over into the space and sees

the disk. She reaches down again for it and her pencil.

Buffy: Oh, hey. (pulls up the disk and pencil) You dropped this.

She hands the unlabeled yellow disk to Willow, who looks at it

curiously.

Willow: It's not mine. It might be something of Ms. Calendar's.

She inserts the disk into her laptop's floppy drive.

Buffy: This feels kinda morbid.

Willow: (smiles at Buffy) I've gone through most of her files already.

Buffy: Does that make it *less* morbid or you *really* morbid?

The program on the disk starts up, and the Rumanian text scrolls into

the left-hand window.

Willow: (sighs) I had to, to teach her class.

The translation program's percent complete window appears, and the bar

begins to zip across the screen.

Buffy: Relax, Will. I was making with the funny.

They both watch as the bar reaches the far side. It disappears, and the

English translation scrolls into the right-hand window.

Buffy: (looks closely) Does that say 'restoration'? (keeps reading)

Willow: It's one of her spells, I think. (looks at Buffy) Ms. Calendar

wasn't a practicing witch, but she did dabble...

Buffy: (interrupts) Willow... (keeps reading)

Willow looks back at the screen and begins reading more. She quickly

realizes what they've found.

Willow: Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

The camera closes in on Buffy. She has stopped reading, and just looks

stunned.

*** Part 2 ***

A wood in Rumania, 1898. Angelus runs through the trees, panting in his

desperation to reach a gypsy camp. Cut to the camp. The camera pans

across the dead body of the young Kalderash Gypsy girl that Angelus has

recently killed. She is on a table dressed in white and lying on an

intricately patterned quilt with candles burning around the perimeter.

Members of the clan are laying rose petals on her. The camera continues

to pan over to the Elder Woman sitting beneath a tent canopy and

chanting over an Orb of Thesulah surrounded by candles within a sacred

circle. Angelus continues running through the woods as she chants.

Elder Woman: Nici mort, nici de-al fiintei, Te invoc, spirit al

trecerii. Reda trupului ce separa omul de animal!

Translation: Neither dead, nor of the living, I invoke you, spirit of

the passing. Return to the body what distinguishes Man from the beast!

Angelus breaks through the trees into the clearing of the camp. He trips

and falls by the great bonfire raging near the center of the camp.

Elder Woman: Asa sa fie.

Translation: So it shall be.

He gets to his hands and knees and looks over at the Elder Woman, still

chanting. Cut to the Elder Woman.

Elder Woman: Utrespur aceastui.

Translation: Restore this one.

The glowing Orb suddenly gets very bright for an instant, and then goes

dark. Cut to Angelus. His eyes grow bright for a moment, then return to

normal, his soul now restored. An elder man of the clan steps up to him

as he sits back on his ankles.

Gypsy Man: It hurts, yes? Good. It will hurt more.

Angel: (confused) Where am I? (pants hard)

Gypsy Man: You don't remember... everything you've done for a hundred

years. In a moment, you will. The face of everyone you killed... our

daughter's face... they will haunt you, and you will know what true

suffering is.

Angel: (still not understanding) Killed? I, I don't...

Slowly the memories come back to him - all the people in Budapest after

the earthquake that he and Darla killed for their blood; all the people

he's turned into demons; the gypsy girl that proved to be his downfall.

Angel: No...

He looks down away from the man and begins to sob.

Angel: No... No... No...

He bends down to the ground in sorrow and grief.

Cut to the library at Sunnydale High School, 1998. Xander and Cordelia

are sitting at the table. Giles walks up to Buffy and Willow.

Giles: What are you saying?

Buffy: The curse. (holds out a printout) This is it.

Willow: Looks like Ms. Calendar was trying to replicate the original

curse. To restore Angel's soul again.

Giles: (takes the printout, stares at it) She said it couldn't be done.

Buffy: Well, she tried anyway. And it looks like it might have worked.

Xander: So he killed her... before she could tell anyone about it. What

a prince, huh? (looks away)

Cordelia: This is good, right? I mean, we can curse him again.

Buffy paces, thinking.

Giles: Um, well, this, um... certainly points the way, but... the

ritual itself requires a greater knowledge of the black arts than I, I,

I can claim.

Willow: Well, I've been going through her files and, and researching

the black arts, for fun, or educational fun, and I may be able to work

this.

Giles: (very concerned) W-Willow... channeling... such potent magicks

through yourself, it could open a door that you may not be able to

close.

Buffy: I don't want you putting yourself in any danger, Will.

Willow: And I don't want danger. Big 'no' to danger, but I may be the

best person to do this.

Xander: Hi! For those of you who have just tuned in, (gets up) everyone

here is a crazy person. (walks to the end of the table) So this spell

might restore Angel's humanity? Well, here's an interesting angle.

(harshly) Who cares?

Buffy: I care.

Xander: (not surprised) Is that right.

Giles: Let's not lose our perspective here, Xander.

Willow looks at Xander, disbelieving what she's hearing from him.

Xander: (standing his ground) I'm Perspective Guy. Angel's a killer.

Willow: Xander...

Buffy: It's not that simple.

Xander: (disgusted) What? All is forgiven? I can't believe you people!

Cordelia: (gets up) Xander has a point.

Xander: (to Cordelia, in a raised voice) You know, just for once, I

wish you'd support me, and I realize right now that you were, and I'm

embarrassed, so I'm gonna get back to the point, (to the others) which

is that Angel needs to die.

Giles: Curing Angel seems to have been Jenny's last wish.

Xander: Yeah? Well, Jenny's dead.

Giles: (approaches Xander angrily) Don't you *ever* speak of her in

that tone again!

Xander: (yells back) Can't you hear what I'm saying?

They begin to argue heatedly. Buffy rushes over and gets between them.

Buffy: Stop it! Stop it!

They all shut up and glare at each other for a moment. Buffy turns away

and goes over to Willow, very upset. Giles paces away, also very upset.

Willow: (quietly) What do you wanna do?

Buffy: (sighs) (quietly) I-I don't know. What happened to Angel wasn't

his fault.

Xander: Yeah, but what happened to Ms. Calendar is.

Buffy and Willow stare at him in disbelief.

Xander: (very coldly) You can paint this any way you want. But the way

I see it is that you wanna forget all about Ms. Calendar's murder so you

can get your boyfriend back.

Buffy refuses to listen to any more of this, and walks out of the

library. Willow and Giles just stare at Xander in surprise and shock. He

walks back to his chair at the table.

Cut to the museum research lab. Dr. Perren is going over his notes when

he hears some whispering coming from behind him. He turns around to

look, but no one's there.

Doug: Hello?

He gets up and slowly walks over to the obelisk. The whispering gets

louder as he nears it. He reaches up to the runes on the face of the

rock and touches them. The whispering seems to be coming from inside. He

places his hand flat on the face of the rock and stares up at it in

amazement. Suddenly Drusilla wraps her hand around his mouth from behind

and pulls his head back to expose his neck. She leans in and bites him

hard as he struggles to get away. Behind her Angelus and two other

vampires approach the obelisk.

Angelus: I'll have one of these to go.

The two vampires walk around the rock with some rope and tools to haul

it away.

Angelus: Dru...

She jerks her head up from her victim and turns her eyes toward him,

growling and smiling a most evil smile.

Angelus: Save me some.

Cut to Buffy's room at home. She piles a bunch of stakes and crosses

into her bag while talking on the phone with Willow.

Buffy: Well, I'll do a couple of sweeps, and then I'll stop by.

(listens) Yeah, Xander was pretty much being a... Willow! Where did you

learn that word? My God. You kiss your mother with that mouth?

She goes over to her desk while listening to Willow talk some more. She

grabs a couple more stakes from the top left drawer.

Buffy: I don't know. I don't know what I wanna do.

At the bottom of the drawer she sees the claddagh ring that Angel gave

her, and stares at it sadly for a moment. She reaches in for it and

holds it gently with her fingers, remembering.

Buffy: I'll, I'll see you in a little while, okay?

She turns off the phone and sets it down. She holds the ring with both

hands again and gazes at the design - two hands for friendship, a crown

for loyalty and a heart for love.

Cut to the park. Buffy walks through on patrol and heads into some

bushes. She stops and jerks her head aside when she hears something

snap. Slowly she takes a few more steps to investigate. She hears

another sound behind her, and spins around to look. Nothing. Again she

takes a couple of steps. Suddenly Kendra comes out of the bushes to

stand right behind her. Buffy instantly pivots around with her fist held

up, ready to punch. She stays herself when she recognizes the other

girl.

Buffy: (exhales) You know, polite people call before they jump out of

the bushes and attack you.

Kendra: (in her accent) Just wanted to test your reflexes.

Buffy: How about testing my face-punching? 'Cause I think you'll find

it's improved.

Kendra: I was on my way to your house. Saw you walking. Couldn't help

meself.

Buffy: (smiles) Which begs the question, and don't think I'm not glad

to see you, but, why are you here? (Kendra starts to answer) Oh, wait. No, let me guess. Your watcher informed you (imitating her accent) dat a

very dark power is about to rise in Sunnydale.

Kendra: Dat's about it.

Buffy: Great. So, you have any idea what this dark power is?

Cut to the main hall in Angelus' mansion. He and Drusilla walk in across

the marble floor to where Spike is sitting in his wheelchair, staring at

the obelisk set in front of the huge fireplace.

Spike: (hears them coming) It's a big rock. I can't wait to tell my

friends. They don't have a rock this big.

Angelus: Spike, boy, you never did learn your history.

Spike: Let's have a lesson, then.

Angelus: Acathla the demon came forth to swallow the world. (strolls to

the obelisk) He was killed by a virtuous knight who pierced the demon's

heart before he could draw a breath to perform the act. Acathla turned

to stone, as demons sometimes do, and was buried (turns to face Spike)

where neither man nor demon would want to look. (starts away from the

obelisk) Unless of course they're putting up low-rent housing. Boys...

The two vampires reach up with crowbars and pry open the tomb. The lid

crashes to the floor, stirring up plenty of dust. Inside is a tall,

horned, stockily built stone demon with a sword protruding from the

right side of its chest. Upon seeing him Drusilla closes her eyes,

raises her hands to the sides of her head and begins to sway it back and

forth.

Drusilla: He fills my head. I can't hear anything else.

Spike: Let me guess. Someone pulls out the sword...

Angelus: Someone worthy...

Spike: Mm. The demon wakes up, and wackiness ensues.

Drusilla: (opens her eyes, lowers her arms) He will swallow the world.

Angelus: And every creature living on this planet will go to Hell.

He walks up to Acathla for a closer look, and turns to face the others.

Angelus: My friends... we're about to make history... end. (smiles

evilly)

*** Part 3 ***

The library. Giles comes out of his office into the main room where

Buffy and Kendra are waiting at the table. Willow is behind the counter,

researching in a book.

Giles: I've been on the phone to the museum. The artifact in question

is missing, and the curator has been murdered. Vampires. (leans on the

table)

Buffy: And you're sure this was the tomb of Alfalfa?

Giles: Acathla. And yes, the information provided by Kendra's Watcher

seems conclusive.

He straightens back up. Willow walks out from behind the counter.

Willow: Okay, somebody explain the whole 'he will suck the world into

Hell' thing, because that's the part I'm not loving.

Giles: Well, the, uh, (puts on his glasses) the Demon Universe exists

in a dimension separate from our own. (sits on the table) With one

breath, Acathla will create a vortex, a-a kind of, um... whirlpool that

will pull everything on Earth into that dimension, where any non-demon

life will suffer horrible and... eternal torment.

Buffy: So that would be the literal kind of 'sucked into Hell'. (smiles

nervously) Neat. (frowns, turns to Willow) Willow, I think you should

try the curse.

Kendra: I tend to side with your friend Xander on this one. Angel

should be eliminated.

Buffy: Oh, I'll fight him. I'll kill him if I have to. But if I don't

get there in time, or if I lose, then Willow might be our only hope.

Willow: (taken aback) I don't *wanna* be our only hope! Uh, I crumble

under pressure! Let's have another hope.

Kendra: We have. (pulls a sword from her bag) Blessed by the knight who

first slew the demon. (Giles looks at the sword, intrigued) If all else

fails, this might stop it. I tink.

Giles: (approaches) Ooh. May I? May I? (takes the sword from Kendra) Thank you. Well, l-let's, uh, hope all else doesn't fail. (to Willow) Um, how close are you to f-figuring out the ritual of the curse?

Willow: (goes to her pack) I need about a day, and... (picks up some

papers and reads) an 'Orb of Thesulah'? Whatever that is.

Giles: (hands the sword back to Kendra) Spirit vault for rituals of the

undead. (heads toward his office) I've got one. (embarrassed) I-I've

been using it as a... paperweight. (disappears into his office)

Willow: (to Buffy) This means I can't help you study for tomorrow's

final.

Buffy: Ah, I'll wing it. Of course, if we go to Hell by then, I won't

have to take 'em. (worried) Or maybe I'll be taking them forever.

Giles: (comes back with the Orb) Angel has a ritual of his own to

perform before he can remove the sword and awaken Acathla. With any

luck, it should take some time.

Buffy stares at the Orb as Giles hands it to Willow.

Cut to Angelus' mansion. Spike paces in his room. He hears Drusilla

coming.

Drusilla: Spike?

He quickly gets back into his chair. Drusilla comes through the curtain

into the room.

Drusilla: Spike, my sweet! The fun's about to begin.

He wheels himself out of the room and heads for the main hall.

Cut to the main hall before the obelisk. The two vampires drag in a

young man, barefoot and bare-chested with his hands tied behind his

back. They drop him to the floor before Spike, Angelus and Drusilla.

Angelus: (comes toward the young man) I will drink... the blood will

wash in me, over me, and I will be cleansed. I will be worthy to free

Acathla. (looks at Spike) Bear witness... (looks at Drusilla) as I

ascend... (looks ahead and morphs into his game face) as I become.

He grabs the man by the hair and lifts him up, holding his head at an

angle to expose his neck. He roars and bites the young man hard and fast

on the neck. He drinks deeply, brings up his hand to brush it against

the man's wound and then lets him fall to the floor dead. He looks at

the blood on his hand. He lowers it and starts to walk slowly toward

Acathla.

Angelus: Everything that I am, everything that I have done, has led me

here.

Cut to Manhattan, 1996. A bum steps up to a trashcan and begins to go

through it. A man walks past him and on down the street. Having found

nothing, the bum makes his way into an alley with slow, labored steps. A

boy runs past him with a package and disappears further down the alley.

The bum, tired and weak, staggers into a concrete post at the side of

the alley and stops. He coughs and rolls around to lean with his back

against the post, and it's Angel, tired, filthy and unkempt. He just

breathes for a moment, and then smells something. He searches the alley

with his eyes and spots a rat scampering across to the other side. He

takes a couple of unsteady steps, brushes the hair from his face and

begins to stalk the rat. It reaches the other side and disappears into a

pile of trashcans and bags. Angel dives after it, scattering the cans

and bags noisily, but loses the rat. A man comes into the alley behind

him. Angel rolls over to sit and flails his arms at the trashcans in

anger over missing the rat. The man comes up to him.

Whistler: God, are you disgusting.

Angel calms down a bit and looks around himself.

Whistler: This is really an unforgettable smell. This is the stench of

death you're giving off here. And the look says, uh... Crazy Homeless

Guy. It's not good.

Angel: (angrily) Get away from me.

Whistler: What are you gonna do, bite me? (gasps and jumps back)

Horrors! A vampire!

Angel looks at him in surprise.

Whistler: Ah, but you wouldn't bite me on account of your poor,

tortured soul. It's so sad, a vampire with a soul. It's so poignant.

Angel: (confused) Who are you?

Whistler: Let's take a walk.

Cut to a ways down the street. The two of them walk along the sidewalk

for a few paces and then turn into the street to cross to the hotdog

stand on the other side. Angel isn't paying any attention to the

traffic, so Whistler grabs his arm to stop him.

Whistler: What are you eating? (they continue across) Like, a rat once

a month?

Angel strays and almost walks into another car. Whistler grabs him again

and pulls him back in time.

Whistler: Hey! (car honks, they continue) Look, you're skin and bones

here! Butcher shops are throwing away more blood in a day than you could

stand. Good blood. (they reach the far side) You lived in the world a

little bit, you'd know that.

Angel: I wanna know who you are. (stops)

Whistler: (stops and faces him) And I wanna know who *you* are.

Angel: You already do.

Whistler: Not yet. But I'm looking to find out. 'Cause you could go

either way here.

Angel: I don't understand you.

Whistler: Nobody understands me. That's my curse. (chuckles)

He steps over to the street vendor and pulls out some cash.

Whistler: Dog me. Mustard.

He watches the vendor get out the hotdog and squirt on some mustard.

Whistler: (to Angel) My name's Whistler.

Vendor: Here you go.

Whistler: (takes the dog) Thanks. (hands over a bill, turns to Angel)

Anyway, lately it is. (takes a bite) Mm.

Angel: (looks down) You're not a vampire.

Whistler: A demon... technically. I mean, I'm not a bad guy. Not all

demons are dedicated to the destruction of all life.

Angel: (looks at him) Whadaya mean, I can go either way?

Whistler: I mean that you can become an even more useless rodent than

you already are, or you can become someone. A person. Someone to be

counted.

Angel: I just wanna be left alone. (starts away)

Whistler: Well, yeah, you've been left alone for, what, ninety years

already. (Angel turns back) And what a package you are. The Stink Guy!

Angel: What do you want from me?

Whistler: I want you to see something.

He gives Angel an intense look. Angel just looks at him.

Whistler: We'd have to leave now. You see, and then you tell me what

you wanna do.

Angel: Where is it?

Cut to Hemery High School in Los Angeles, 1996. School is over for the

day, and the students come streaming out. An old, rusted Chevy Impala

with its windows spray-painted black pulls up on the far side of the

street. The driver's window lowers, and Angel squints out into the

daylight, careful to remain in shadow. He looks over at the building and

sees Buffy come down the steps with three of her friends.

Buffy: So I'm like, 'Dad, do you want me to go to the dance in an

outfit I've already worn? Why do you hate me?'

Girl#1: Is Tyler taking you?

Buffy: Where were you when I got over Tyler? He's of the past. (Angel

watches her) Tyler would have to crawl on his hands and knees to get me

to go to the dance with him. Which, actually, he's supposed to do after

practice, so I'm gonna wait.

Girl#1: Okay. See ya later.

Girl#2: Bye!

Buffy: (waves to Girl#1) Call me!

Girl#1: Okay!

Buffy: (waves to Girl#2) Call me! (waves to Girl#3) Call me!

Girl#3: I will!

Buffy climbs back up a few steps and looks around. She takes off her

jacket and sits down to wait for Tyler. She lays the jacket across her

legs and idly looks around again. A man in a black suit approaches her.

He is her first Watcher, who has finally found her.

Watcher: Buffy Summers?

Buffy: (looks at him) Yeah? (smiles) Hi! (confused) What?

Watcher: I need to speak with you.

Buffy: (worried) You're not from Bullock's, are you? 'Cause I-I meant

to pay for that lipstick.

Watcher: There isn't much time. You must come with me. Your destiny

awaits.

Buffy: (confused, shakes her head) I don't have a destiny. (nods) I'm

destiny-free, really.

Watcher: (seriously) Yes, you have. You are the Chosen One. You alone

can stop them.

Buffy: Who?

Watcher: The vampires.

Buffy: (considers for a moment) Huh?

Cut to a cemetery. Buffy lands flat on her back.

Buffy: Oof!

A vampire props himself over her, growling menacingly. She is very

frightened, and looks around frantically for what to do. Angel watches

from behind some gravestones. Buffy spots her stake, but can't reach it,

so she just gets her hands underneath the vampire and pushes him off. He

flies off of her and lands hard on his back.

Buffy: Oh, God...

She rolls onto her hands and knees and scrambles on all fours to

retrieve her stake.

Buffy: Oh, God... Oh... Oh, God... Unh!

She grabs the stake and quickly gets to her feet. She looks at it,

unsure of what to do next. The vampire gets up and lunges at her.

Reflexively she grabs him, sidesteps him and sends him flipping over to

the ground again, dazed. She looks at the vampire, amazed by what she

just did. She glances back at the Watcher, down at her stake and then

makes her move to dispatch the vampire. She quickly gets to her knees,

raises the stake above her head and plunges it into him, but gets him in

the gut instead of the chest.

Buffy: Oh! Not the heart!

Angel watches, concerned. Buffy plunges the stake into the vampire

again, and this time hits her mark. An instant later the vampire bursts

into ashes. Buffy is caught by surprise, and she screams and jumps back,

landing on her butt. She just stares at the ashes on the grass in wide-

eyed shock. Behind her the Watcher steps up.

Watcher: You see? You see your power?

Buffy isn't at all sure she wants to see. Angel continues to watch.

Cut to Buffy's house in L.A. The camera looks into her room from

outside. Buffy comes in with her mother close behind.

Joyce: Why didn't you call?

Buffy: (faces her mom) I'm sorry. I-I didn't know it was so late. Tyler

and I were talking.

Joyce: (exhales) That boy is irresponsible.

Buffy: No, mom. It's not his fault. (takes off her jacket)

Joyce: You know we worry, that's all.

They look at each other for a moment, and Joyce shrugs.

Joyce: Dinner's in ten minutes. (leaves)

Buffy: (whispers) Yeah.

She goes through the other door into her bathroom. The camera pans from

the bedroom window over to the bathroom window. She turns on the water

to wash up from the cemetery. Her parents talk in the hall, and she can

hear as it escalates into an argument.

Hank: Did she say where she was?

Joyce: She was with Tyler.

Hank: I don't want her seeing him anymore, period!

Angel looks in at her from outside.

Joyce: You're overreacting, dear.

Buffy looks at herself in the mirror sadly. The tears begin to come.

Hank: Don't do that! Don't talk to me like I'm a kid!

Joyce: I don't! Just forget it!

Angel continues to watch and listen.

Hank: Just because you can't discipline her, I have to be the ogre!

Buffy keeps on staring into the mirror.

Joyce: I am not having this conversation again! Alright?

Buffy looks down and tries hard not to cry.

Cut to the sewers. Angel arrives where Whistler is waiting for him.

Whistler: She's gonna have it tough, that Slayer. She's just a kid. The

world's full of big, bad things.

Angel: I wanna help her. (Whistler looks at him) I want... I wanna

become someone.

Whistler: God, jeez, look at you. She must be prettier than the last

Slayer. (Angel looks away) This isn't gonna be easy. The more you live

in this world, the more you see how apart from it you really are.

(sternly) And this is dangerous work. Right now, you couldn't go three

rounds with a fruit fly!

Angel: (with resolve) I wanna learn from you.

Whistler: Alright.

Angel: But I don't wanna dress like you. (starts to leave)

Whistler: (follows) Again, you're annoying me. You're lucky we need you

on our side.

Cut to Angelus' mansion, 1998. He approaches Acathla, still vamped out.

Angelus: I have strayed, I have been lost. But Acathla redeems me. With

this act, we will be free.

He grabs the hilt of the sword with both hands. A blindingly bright

light emanates from it. Drusilla smiles and bathes herself in it.

Angelus begins to shake with the power of the sword.

*** Part 4 ***

In the main hall of Angelus' mansion. He holds onto the sword tightly,

trying to draw it out of Acathla. It won't budge, and a moment later a

bright red flame bursts from the sword, throwing Angelus back and onto

the floor.

Spike: (sing-song) Someone wasn't worthy.

Angelus: (scrambles to his feet) Damn it!

Drusilla: (freaks out) This is so... disappointing! (moans)

Angelus: (paces angrily) There must be something I missed. The

incantations, the blood... I don't know!

Spike tries hard to suppress a snicker, hiding his mouth with his hand.

Drusilla: (whining) What are we going to do?

Angelus: (menacingly) What we always do in a time of trouble: turn to

an old friend.

Hope returns to Drusilla's eyes.

Angelus: (viciously) We'll have our Armageddon. I swear!

He grabs a vase from a shelf and heaves it at the far wall, smashing it

into hundreds of tiny pieces.

Cut to class the next day. Willow, Buffy, Xander, Cordelia and the rest

of the class are taking one of their final exams. Everyone is intent on

it. Buffy looks up and glances around briefly, then turns her attention

back on her paper.

Cut to the hall. There are very few students. A mysterious figure with a

shawl over its head walks slowly toward the room where the team is

taking their test. The camera follows. The few students who pass don't

take any notice.

Cut back to the class. Everyone is concentrating on the test, and no one

notices as the vampire comes in and pulls the shawl away from its face.

Vampire: Tonight... Sundown... (everyone looks up) At the graveyard...

Teacher: (gets up) Excuse me...

Exposed now to the daylight, the vampire begins to smoke.

Vampire: You will come to him. (takes the shawl off) You will come to

him or more will die.

She points at Buffy and ignites. Buffy watches, taken aback by the

vampire's direct approach at delivering her message.

Vampire: Tonight!

The students scream, jump out of their chairs and begin to run from the

room. Cordelia and Xander also jump up, but don't run. Buffy remains

calmly in her seat.

Vampire: His hour is at hand!

She combusts in a flash of flame and smoke. Buffy just stares at the

empty space before her.

Cut to the library. Xander, Cordelia and Willow are researching at the

table. Kendra approaches with her sheathed sword. The camera pulls back

to show Giles and Buffy up on the mezzanine.

Buffy: She said more would die. I have to go.

Kendra: Den I should go wit you.

Buffy: (faces Kendra) No. I need you here just in case. (heads for the

stairs) I can take care of myself. And look, (comes down) as long as

Angel's fighting me, then he can't do this end-of-the-world ritual

thingy, and that's a good. (reaches the table) Will, what do you think?

Willow: (looks over her research) I just want to cross-check...

Buffy: We don't have time. If this is gonna work, it has to work now.

Willow: Okay. Then I need maybe half an hour once we're all set up.

Giles: (looks at the shelves) Which means you just have to hold Angel

off. Don't let him close on you. (pulls out a book) If the curse

succeeds, you'll, you'll know.

He tosses the book down to Xander. Xander checks the title, and hands it

to Willow.

Cordelia: Why don't you just wait here to find out if it worked, see if

he phones you?

Buffy: I can't risk him killing any more people. I better go. (starts

out)

Xander: Be careful.

Buffy: (looks back) I will. (starts out again.)

Kendra: Here...

She grabs a stake from the table. Buffy stops and looks back. Kendra

goes over to her and holds up the twisted but very sharp stake.

Kendra: In case de curse does not succeed, dis is my lucky stake. I

have killed many vampires wit it. I call it Mr. Pointy.

Buffy: You named your stake?

Kendra: (a bit embarrassed) Yes.

Buffy: (smiles) Remind me to get you a stuffed animal.

She accepts the stake from Kendra and looks it over.

Buffy: Thanks.

Kendra: (exhales) Watch your back.

Buffy leaves the library.

Cut to the cemetery. Buffy walks through, watching all around as she

goes. Angelus walks out from behind a small mausoleum.

Angelus: Hello, lover. I wasn't sure you'd come.

Buffy: After your immolation-o-gram? Come on, I had to show. Shouldn't

you be out destroying the world right now, pulling the sword out of Al

Franken or whatever his name is?

Angelus: There's time enough. I wanted to say goodbye first. You are

the one thing in this dimension I will miss.

Buffy: This is a beautiful moment we're having. Can we please fight?

Angelus: I didn't come here to fight.

Buffy: (raises her eyebrows) No?

Angelus: Gosh, I was hoping we could get back together. What do you

think? Do we have a shot? (gets a look from Buffy) Alright. We'll fight.

He rushes at her.

Cut to the library. Willow is sitting cross-legged on the table. Before

her is the Orb of Thesulah within a sacred circle and surrounded by

candles, bones and stones. Willow casts some stones. She looks at them

and then gives Giles a nod. He opens a book and reads the Latin text.

Giles: Quod perditum est, invenietur.

Translation: What is lost, return.

Cordelia swirls incense into the air while Xander watches.

Willow: 'Not dead nor not of the living. Spirits of the interregnum I

call...'

Cut to the graveyard. Buffy ducks a punch from Angelus and comes up

behind him. He spins around to block her return swing. He blocks another

jab from her, and punches her in the face. He follows up with a left

hook, and Buffy loses her balance and nearly falls down. Angelus grabs

her by the back of her coat and throws her over onto the grounds. She

rolls away and onto her back, and looks up at him.

Buffy: Come on, Willow.

She swiftly gets back to her feet to continue fighting.

Cut to the library. Kendra guards the main doors.

Willow: 'Let him know the pain of humanity, gods. Reach your wizened

hands to me. Give me the sword...'

Suddenly a vampire comes out from the stacks and attacks Xander from

behind. The main doors fly open, and Kendra spins around to defend as

two more vampires walk in. Giles points to the steps and yells at the

girls as a fourth vampire appears from the stacks.

Giles: Get out! Go!

Willow and Cordelia make for the stairs. Kendra punches the first of the

two vampires to reach her. The fourth one jumps over the mezzanine

railing and lands on Giles' back, knocking him into the table. Cordelia

and Willow run up the stairs and see Xander elbow the vampire on his

back, knocking the demon into a bookcase. Having punched down the one

vampire, Kendra grabs the other and shoves her into the wall. The first

one gets up and rushes in to fight. Willow runs around behind the stacks

to try to escape. Cordelia is frozen in fright. Giles grabs a vase from

the table and smashes it over his attacker's head. Xander's assailant

rushes him again, but Xander sidesteps him. He spins around, grabs

Xander and shoves him into a bookcase. The one down below hops up onto

the table, runs across it and leaps over the railing above. Willow sees

him coming, and hides behind a bookcase. The vampire doesn't stop and

just pushes the case over onto Willow. She falls to the floor, and the

books and case land on top of her, knocking her out. The vampire Kendra

is fighting ducks her swing. Xander's opponent grabs his arm, loops his

own around it tightly and pulls down, breaking it. Xander yells out in

pain. Kendra ducks a roundhouse kick from her enemy and blocks several

swings. Xander grabs his tormenter's hair and smashes his head down on

the railing. Below Giles ducks a swing and punches the vampire in the

gut. Kendra lands two punches in the face of her attacker. Giles pounds

his assailant on the back, but he just roars and spins around with a

punch to Giles' face, knocking him out. Xander picks the dazed vampire

up and shoves him into the other one going at Cordelia, knocking him

down.

Xander: Go!

He grabs his broken arm and winces in pain. Cordelia screams and runs

out through the stacks. Xander watches Kendra's opponent punch her in

the face, but Kendra ducks and backs into her and comes up holding back

the vampire's head. She plunges her stake into her heart, and she bursts

into ashes. Xander winces again in pain. Willow lies prone under the

fallen bookcase. Kendra looks around for her next target. She sees the

one going for Giles, and rushes over to pull him off. She shoves him

around to the floor. He tries to get up, but she just punches him back

down. He tries again, and she grabs him and throws him through the

window into Giles' office. Just then another one tackles her from the

side.

Cut to the cemetery. Buffy punches Angelus, but he takes it in stride.

She swings again, but he grabs her arm and holds on tight. She swings

with the other one, but he grabs it, too, and then pushes her away.

Angelus: Jeez, is it me, or is your heart not in this?

Buffy pulls out Kendra's stake.

Angelus: Maybe I'll just go home, destroy the world.

Buffy: Well, I think Mr. Pointy'll have something to say about that.

Come on. Let's finish this. You and me.

Angelus: (chuckles) Y-you never learn, do you? This wasn't about you.

This was never about you. (chuckles)

She realizes the trap was set for the others, and begins to run.

Angelus: (smiles) And you fall for it every single time!

Cut to the library. A vampire punches Kendra, and she stumbles, but

regains her footing. Up in the stacks the other one comes at Xander and

punches him in the face, knocking him out. Below Kendra is hit by a

roundhouse kick, and falls. The library doors swing open, and Drusilla

walks in. The vampire tries to kick Kendra, but she blocks it and swings

out with her leg, tripping him, and gets back to her feet to face the

other two, the one that came down from above, the other one now back out

of Giles' office. The third one is up again also, and they close in on

her, but before any more fighting can ensue Drusilla claps her hands.

Drusilla: Enough.

She bids Kendra come hither with her waving fingers. The other three

just back off. Kendra faces Drusilla, ready to fight. Drusilla walks

around her and goads her on. Kendra kicks at her, but Drusilla blocks

her easily, as well as two follow-up swings. She punches Kendra and

sends her spinning to the floor.

Cut to a street. Buffy runs like mad to get to the school.

Cut to the library. Drusilla ducks a kick from Kendra and grabs her by

the arms. She swings her around and shoves her away. Kendra comes back

at her again with a kick to the gut, and Drusilla doubles over for an

instant. Kendra lunges at her, but Drusilla grabs her by the throat and

forces her back against the counter, gripping hard and choking her.

Drusilla: Look at me, Dearie.

She waves two extended fingers before Kendra's eyes and begins to

hypnotize her.

Drusilla: Be... in my eyes. Be... in me.

She lets go, and Kendra is completely under her spell. She sways back

and forth a bit, and Kendra follows her every move to stay in contact

with her eyes. Drusilla backs away slightly, lowering her arms and never

losing eye contact.

Cut to the park. Buffy races through, leaping a bench as she runs.

Cut to the library. Kendra continues to sway with Drusilla. Drusilla

extends out the fingers of her right hand at her side. She smiles evilly

as she swings her hand up and slices Kendra's neck with her sharp nails.

Kendra grabs at her neck as it begins to bleed heavily, and collapses to

the floor. Drusilla watches her fall, and turns to look down at her.

Drusilla: Night-night.

She kisses the air above her and turns to her accomplices.

Drusilla: Let's get what we came for, dears.

Two of them grab an unconscious Giles by the arms and drag him from the

library. Drusilla and the third vampire follow them out.

Cut outside. Buffy runs across the school grounds. Cut into the halls.

Buffy throws open the door and rushes in. As she rounds a corner the

scene slows. Buffy runs down the hall in slow motion as Whistler

narrates over the scene.

Whistler: Bottom line is, even if you see 'em coming, you're not ready

for the big moments.

Buffy barges into the library and stops.

Whistler: No one asks for their life to change, not really. But it

does.

She looks around at the damage, and then sees Kendra lying on the floor.

She runs to her, still in slow motion, and skids down next to her on her

knees. She sees that she's gone, and takes her hand.

Whistler: So what are we, helpless? Puppets? No. The big moments are

gonna come. You can't help that. It's what you do afterwards that

counts. That's when you find out who you are.

Buffy reaches up to Kendra's face with her other hand and strokes it

gently. Behind her a police officer raises his gun at her.

Officer: Freeze!

Buffy looks back at him, seemingly caught red-handed.

Whistler: You'll see what I mean.

To Be Continued...
