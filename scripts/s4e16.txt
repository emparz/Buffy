*** PROLOGUE ***

Fade in. Night. Exterior shot of the Summers home. Several police cars are out in front of the house, strobing the neighborhood with their red lights. An ambulance is parked on the lawn, it's rear doors open and facing the house. A few curious neighbors have also gathered. A plainclothes detective is talking to the young woman he thinks is Buffy Summers. They're standing close to the steps of the front porch. Joyce Summers is walking out of the house and drapes a coat around Faith [Buffy]'s shoulders.

Detective: It's good you called. We've been looking for this girl since she broke out of the hospital.

Joyce: What's going to happen to her?

Detective: Well, get her checked out. If she's in stable condition,

she goes to jail, pending trial.

Joyce: I just hope she gets some kind of help.

Behind them, the paramedics are wheeling a gurney out the front door.

Buffy [Faith]'s body is strapped to it. She's barely conscious.

Detective: The first thing is to keep her from hurting anybody else.

As it's taken past Joyce and Faith [Buffy], Buffy[Faith] looks at them with half-opened eyes. From her blurring POV she sees Faith [Buffy] take her mother's hand and lift it, casually, to make sure she sees this. Then her vision fades as she loses consciousness. The paramedics load her into the ambulance.

Detective: Well, you guys will be safe now. We may have a couple of

questions in the morning.

Joyce: Oh, uh, of course.

Detective: Thank you both. I'm glad we finally got the kid.

Faith [Buffy]: (sharply) She's not a kid. (sees the detective's surprised

look) I just mean that she's very strong.

Detective: Yeah. This Faith chick-- definitely dangerous.

With that, the detective turns and walks toward one of the squad cars.

Joyce heads back into the house, but Faith [Buffy] stands there watching the ambulance pull out of the drive way.

Faith [Buffy]: She truly is.

Faith [Buffy] turns, in her new body, and starts walking back to the house.

Wolf's howl. Buffy theme and credits roll.

*** ACT 1 ***

Fade in. Interior of the Summers home. The last of the police have left and Joyce is closing the front door. Faith [Buffy] is casually walking into the living room stretching her arms.

Startled, Faith [Buffy] spins around to face her, slight panic on her face. Joyce has a thoughtful expression.

Joyce: Why do you think she's like that?

Faith [Buffy]: (shrugs) You know. She's a nut job. Heh.

Joyce: I just don't understand what could drive a person to that kind of behavior.

Faith [Buffy]: Well, how do you know she got drove? I mean, maybe she likes being that way.

Joyce: I'll never believe that. I think she's horribly unhappy.

Faith [Buffy]: Well, could be things are looking up. I mean, a little stint in the pokey, show her the error of her ways. (grins) I'm sure there's some big old Bertha just waiting to shower her ripe little self with affection.

Joyce: (shocked) Buffy!

Faith [Buffy]: I'm sorry, mom. (Sighs) It's just... (crosses the room to Joyce)  ugh when I think about how she might have hurt you, I just... ugh I can't stand it.

Touched, Joyce smiles and gives her a big hug. Over her shoulder Faith [Buffy] grimaces in discomfort at this mushy affection. She pulls away and heads towards the stairs.

Joyce: (slightly hurt) Sorry.

Faith [Buffy]: (makes of show of stretching her shoulders) No, I'm just, uh,

sore from the fight.

Joyce: I've missed you.

Faith [Buffy]: 'Cause I haven't visited, right? (smugly) I knew it.

Joyce: I know how it is. You've . . . got so much in your life now.

Faith [Buffy]: I'm a busy little beaver. College and all.

Joyce: (nods) Of course. (hopefully) But, um, maybe we could spend some time together soon? Some night when I'm not being held hostage by a raving psychotic.

Faith [Buffy]: (pauses) Count on it. (smiles) I'm gonna take a bath.

Faith [Buffy] turns abruptly and heads upstairs.

Cut to Faith [Buffy] in the tub, having a bubble bath.

Faith [Buffy] sighs with her eyes closed. Then she raises her arms out of the water to examine them. She lifts her left leg straight up to look at it and smiles, caressing it with her hands. Faith [Buffy] lowers the leg back in the water and scoops two handfuls of suds and blows the bubbles into the air.

Cut to Faith [Buffy] looking at Buffy's reflection in the mirror, from the mirror's POV.

Faith [Buffy]'s hair is hanging wet on her shoulders and she has a towel wrapped around herself. She turns her head to the right then to the left. She leans towards the mirror for a closer look and scrunches her face. She relaxes her features then uses her index fingers to push her eyebrows high on her forehead. Next, she opens her mouth wide to stick her tongue out. Again she uses her index fingers to raise her top lip, looking at Buffy's very white teeth.

Cut to a few frames later, still in front of the mirror.

Faith [Buffy] speaking in a pleasant voice.

Faith [Buffy]: Why, yes, I would be Buffy. May I help you?

Cut to a few frames later.

Faith [Buffy]: (practicing) Buf-fy.

Cut to Faith [Buffy] sticking her tongue out again, head tilted to the side.

Cut to Faith [Buffy] running her fingers through her wet hair, then puts forth an admonishing finger as if speaking to a child.

Faith [Buffy]: (scolding) You can't do that! It's wrong.

She shakes her head slightly.

Faith [Buffy]: (sensitively) You can't do that, because it's naughty. (grimaces)

Faith [Buffy]: (sternly) Because it's wrong.

Faith [Buffy]: (empathetically) Because it's wrong.

Faith [Buffy] walks a few feet away from the mirror then suddenly whips around to face it, pointing at it with her hand in a

gun shape.

Faith [Buffy]: You can't do that! It's wrong! I'll kick your ass!

Faith [Buffy] still pointing at the mirror.

Faith [Buffy]: I'm gonna kill you!

Faith [Buffy] leans closer to the mirror as a voice-over of evil laughter is heard.


Cut to the hospital. A burly male nurse comes crashing across

the room, hitting the counter, and falls to the floor. He just had

his ass thrown.

Buffy [Faith]: Let me go! Let me go!

Camera pans and sees Buffy [Faith] thrashing in a bed trying to free herself from the men who are holding her down. The doctor hurries away from the bed as a police officer, the detective, and two orderlies restrain her. It's all they can do to keep her on the bed.

Doctor: Get me a sedative, NOW!

Detective: Hold her!

Buffy [Faith]: (yelling) I have to go home! She's with my mother!

The doctor returns and clamps a hand on Buffy [Faith]'s arm to still it and shoves a syringe needle into her vein.

Buffy [Faith]: NO!

Doctor: Just lie still.

Buffy [Faith]: (weakening voice) You don't understand.

Detective: Keep holding her.

Buffy [Faith]'s struggles quickly lessen as the drug takes effect.

Buffy [Faith]: (fading) She's taken myâ€¦ my body.

Unable to keep her eyes open her head falls back.


Cut to Tara's dimly lit room. Willow is laying on the bed, hands folded across her stomach. Tara is sitting on the other side of the bed reading tarot cards.

Willow: I wonder where she is?

Tara: Who? Faith?

Willow: Yeah. I wish she would make a move. She's making my stomach all acidy.

Tara: But you think Buffy can handle her?

Willow sits up to face her.

Willow: I think so. (worried) But that doesn't mean Faith won't hurt someone else.

Tara: Well, you should be safe. Nobody knows you're here. I mean... they don't even know I exist, right? I know all about them, but...

Willow: (softly) Hey.

Willow puts a gentle hand on Tara's knee. Tara continues.

Tara: I mean-I mean, th-that's totally cool. I mean, it-it's good. It's... it's better.

Willow: Tara, it's not like I don't want my friends to know you. It's just... well, Buffy's like my best friend, and she's really special. And there's this whole bunch of us, and we sort of have this group thing that revolves around the slaying, and-and I, I really want you to meet them. But I kind of like having something that's just, you know, mine.
Tara regards her silently for a moment.

Willow: And I-I usually don't use so many words to say stuff that little, but (laughs softly) do you get it at all?
Tara: I do.

Willow takes a deep breath.

Willow: I should check in with Giles, get a situation update.

Willow gets up and rounds the bed to the other side of the room behind Tara.

Tara: I am, you know.

Willow stops to face Tara.

Willow: What?

Tara looks over her shoulder at Willow.

Tara: (meaningfully) Yours.

Willow smiles at this.


Cut to Buffy's bedroom.

Faith [Buffy] is standing in front of the full-length mirror checking out Buffy's reflection. She's dressed in a long, sleek black tank top and black leather pants and boots. Her hair is in wavy curls. Reaching into the shirt, she adjusts Buffy's breasts to a more perky position then puts her hands on her hips to inspect the improved cleavage.

Faith [Buffy]: Not too bad.

Faith [Buffy] turns to Buffy's dresser and begins to search it. In the first drawer she opens she finds Buffy's passport and flips through it.

Faith: Score.

Faith [Buffy] is sitting on the bed, holding a credit card. and is on the phone.

Faith [Buffy]: 6-4-4-7. (Pauses) Uh, expiration, 5-0-1. (Pauses and puts the card back in her purse.) Unh huh. (Pauses) Yeah. (Pauses and takes cash out of the purse.) 10 a.m.'s your earliest flight? I'll take it.

Joyce enters.

Joyce: What are you doing?

Faith [Buffy]: Oh, just getting my mail.

Faith [Buffy] holds up the letters.

Joyce: Oh. Um, that was, um, Giles on the other line. He wanted you to meet your friends there. Said he had news.

Faith [Buffy]: Yeah. I got some time to kill. (gets up) I'll go see the gang. All my friends. (picks up a lipstick.) You don't mind if I steal this, right?

Joyce: Is that the Harlot?

Faith [Buffy]: Yeah.

Joyce: That's the same one Faith picked.

Faith [Buffy]: Burn it.

Faith [Buffy] tosses it to Joyce who catches it.

Cut to Buffy [Faith] in the back of a police car with a uniformed officer driving and a plainclothes office riding shotgun.

Buffy [Faith] moans almost inaudibly.

Policeman #1: She's coming to.

Policeman #2: Yeah.

Policeman #1: Man, I want this kid's constitution.

Buffy [Faith]: Faith.

Policeman #1: Let's move it. I want to get her in before she's 100%.

The uniformed policeman nods.

A red armored car/truck cuts off the police car which crashes into it. Two men in black clothing jump out of the back. One uses a gun to

cover the two police officers, who seem to be stunned. Another

uses an ax to smash the back window. The one with the gun breaks

remnants on the sides with the gun. The ax one drags Buffy [Faith] out

the window.

Weatherby: By order of the Watcher's Council, you are being taken into custody until such time...

They both drag Buffy [Faith] to the back of the armored truck.

Collins: Skip the speech.

They pull her in the truck.

Collins: Let's go.

The doors close.

*** ACT 2 ***

Faith [Buffy] enters Giles' home.

Giles: Buffy. good.

Faith [Buffy]: The scooby gang's all here. Willow, Xander, and... (looks at Anya) everybody. What's up?

Giles: It's about Faith, not surprisingly.

Faith [Buffy]: Didn't Joyce tell you? I already kicked that ass.

Xander: I feel a high five coming on.

Willow: Where is she?

Faith [Buffy]: On her way to the big house. Cops took her off my hands about an hour ago. Poetic justice.

Anya: How's that?

Faith [Buffy]: Well, she did all those crimes, and now she's being arrested.

Silence.
Faith [Buffy]: I guess that's just regular justice.
Willow smiles.

Faith [Buffy]: It's cool, anyway.

Giles: Unless I'm mistaken, Faith is no longer in police custody.

Faith [Buffy]: (stands) What are you talking about?

Giles: Watcher's Council. They, uh sent a retrieval team to capture Faith.

Faith [Buffy]: Well, yeah, I mean, 'cause it worked so well when Wesley tried it.

Giles: This is a special operations unit. They, uh, handle the council's trickier jobs - smuggling, interrogation, wetworks.

Willow: What's wetworks?

Xander: Scuba-type stuff.

Anya: I thought it was murder.

Xander: Well, yeah, but there could be underwater murder, with snorkels.

Faith [Buffy]: So they're taking her to England?

Giles: It'll be a long, long time before she returns.

Faith [Buffy]: Heh heh heh. ahhh Hah hah. Hah hah. ohhh I'm sorry. It's just...I'm happy. Faith is evil.

Willow: Yeah. I hope they throw the book at her.

Giles: I'm not sure there is a, a book for this.

Willow: They could throw other things.

Faith [Buffy]: I forgot how much you don't like Faith.

Willow: After what she's done to you? Oh, I wish those council guys would let me have an hour alone

in the room with her, if I was larger and had grenades.

Faith [Buffy]: I bet I know what Faith would say to that.

In Faith [Buffy]'s head she springs forward with a knife and sticks it in Willow's stomach

in the same place Faith was stabbed. She pulls the knife out and

stabs Willow again.

Faith [Buffy] lifts her head from her revelry. She did not spring forward.

Anya: So what you're saying is that everything's fine?

Giles: Oh, um, yes.

Anya: Well, I'm glad you called us all here because that information

could never be conveyed by telephone.

Willow: (to Buffy) What's up?

Giles: Well, I just thought it was, uh, best to convene, in case there were any loose ends...

Faith [Buffy]: (to Willow) I'd never let her hurt you.

Giles: ...or things that we might have forgotten.

Willow: (to Buffy) I know.

Giles: But if you're, uh, keen to go, then, please, by all means, go.

Xander: We kind of have a romantic evening planned.

Anya: We were gonna light a bunch of candles and have sex near them.

Faith [Buffy]: Well, we certainly don't want to cut into that seven minutes.

Anya: Hey.

Xander: I believe that's my hey. Hey!

Faith [Buffy]: Lighten up. We're out of danger. Everything's good.

Giles: We still have Adam to take care of.

Faith [Buffy]: Yeah. Adam. What's up with him?

Giles: I wish we knew.

Faith [Buffy]: Well, don't worry about it. I'll patrol tonight, as long as it takes. You guys have your fun, I'll be out there doing my job.

Cut to Faith [Buffy] dancing in the Bronze to rock band.

Faith [Buffy]: Whoop.

Spike: Oh, you.

Faith [Buffy]: And you.

Spike: What, are you keeping tabs on me? You're gonna give me a hard time now?

Faith [Buffy]: Um, do I usually give you a hard time?

Spike: Very funny. Well, you don't have to worry about me drinking. Unless you're here to protect innocent beers. (holds up a bottle.)

Spike walks away a little and Faith [Buffy] follows.

Faith [Buffy]: You're a vampire.

Spike: Was. And as soon as I get this chip out of my head, I'll be a

vampire again. But until then, I'm just as helpless as a kitten up a tree. So why don't you sod off?

Faith [Buffy]: Ok.

Spike: (angrily) Oh, fine! Throw it in my face! Spike's not a threat

anymore. I'll turn my back. He can't hurt me.

Faith [Buffy]: Spike? (Gets it.) Spike. William the Bloody with a chip in

his head. I kind of love this town.

Spike: You know why I really hate you, Summers?

Faith [Buffy]: 'Cause I'm a stuck-up tight-ass with no sense of fun?

Spike: Well, yeah, that covers a lot of it.

Faith [Buffy]: Cause I could do anything I want, and instead, I choose

to pout and whine and feel the burden of slayerness? I mean, I could

be rich, I could be famous, I could have anything. Anyone.

Faith [Buffy] moves closer and puts her hands on Spike's chest.

Faith [Buffy]: Even you, Spike. I could ride you at a gallop until your legs

buckled and your eyes rolled up. I've got muscles you've never

even dreamed of. I could squeeze you until you popped like warm

champagne, and you'd beg me to hurt you just a little bit more. And you know why I don't? (moves closer and looks up at him pursing her lips.) Because it's wrong. Humh humh. (moves off.)

Spike: I get this chip out, you and me are gonna have a confrontation.

Faith [Buffy]: Count on it.

Spike throws his bottle into the wall and walks off. He shoves someone

and clutches his head.

Cut to the sewers.

Four vampires are walking in vamp face.

Vampire: It was too crowded. We gotta hold out for a few hours,

pick up a straggler, some drunk. Can't be calling attention

to (sees Adam and stops.) ourselves.

Adam: I've been thinking. About vampires.

Vampire: This is my place.

Adam: You're place. Yes. The sewers. You hide from them, crawl about in their filth. Scavenging like rats. What do you fear?

Vampire: Kill this guy already.

One vampire charges Adam and Adam grabs it by the throat and holds it.

Adam: You fear the cross. The sun. Fire. And, oh, yes...

Adams puts his other hand on the vampire's shoulder and he lifts the

vampire's head from its shoulders. The body falls and he drops the

head on it and they turn to dust.

Adam: I believe decapitation is a problem as well.

Vampire: You can have the place. I mean, we don't have to stay here anymore.

Adam: You fear death. Being immortal, you fear it more than those

to whom it comes naturally. Vampires are a paradox.

Vampire: Ok, we're a paradox. That's cool.

Adam: Demon in a human body. You walk in both worlds and belong to neither. I can relate. Come. We have a lot to talk about.

Cut to warehouse.

In the back of the armored truck, Buffy [Faith] wakes up and finds she is

chained.

Weatherby: Well, it's awake.

Buffy [Faith]: Who are you?

Weatherby: Council. We're taking you back to the mother country. Seems you've been a naughty girl.

Buffy [Faith]: Listen to me. Y-You've made a mistake. I am not Faith. I'm Buffy Summers. Faith performed some kind of spell, she switched our bodies.

Collins standing outside the truck.

Collins: Congratulations. No one's ever actually tried that one on me before.

Buffy [Faith]: You have to find Faith. C-call Giles. J-just get him here.

Collins: Giles doesn't work for the council anymore. For that matter,

neither does Buffy Summers. And what you are, miss, is a package. I deliver the package. I don't much care what's inside. (To Weatherby.) Come on.

Weatherby: He may not care, but I do. The Watcher's Council used to

mean something. You perverted it. You trash. We should have killed you

while you were asleep.

He spits in Buffy [Faith]'s face. He gets out of the truck and closes the doors.

Cut to the Bronze.

Willow: I can't believe you've never been here. The Bronze is the

coolest place in Sunnydale. Of-of course, there's not a lot of competition. I think the vending machine at Bergen's came in second.

Tara: Y-you used to come here a lot?

Others: Chug chug chug

Willow: I lived here. Me, Xander...

Faith [Buffy]: Chug, chug, chug.

Willow: Buffy.

Faith [Buffy]: Chug, chug, chug.

Faith [Buffy]: oooh ooooh.

Others: Chug, chug, chug!

Others: Woo hoo hoo.

Willow: Wow. I-I didn't think she'd be here. Come on, (holds Tara's hand) I want you to meet her.

Faith [Buffy]: Back off. (Pushes someone away.) You're nothing but a disappointment.

Tara crosses her arms.

Willow: Hey, Buffy.

Faith [Buffy]: Willow and - uh

Willow: Buffy, this is Tara.

Tara: Hi.

Faith [Buffy]: So we've never met.
Tara shakes her head.

Faith [Buffy]: Cool. Just have a thing with names.

Willow: Tara was in my wicca group.

Faith [Buffy]: Unh-huh. (walks away and they follow.)

Willow: So, what's up?

Faith [Buffy] plops herself on a couch.

Willow: Patrol a no-go?
Faith [Buffy] throws her legs up in the air and on a table.

Faith [Buffy]: Got tired. You know, the whole Faith thing. I let off some steam.

Willow: Good for you. You shouldn't work yourself too hard.

Faith [Buffy]: That's my philosophy. (throws her arms behind her head.)

Willow: Anyone want a soda?

Tara: (looks at Willow) Water.

Faith [Buffy] shakes head. Willow walks off and Faith [Buffy] notes Tara looking back

at Willow. She sits up and leans forward.

Faith [Buffy]: So you guys been hanging out a lot lately, huh?

Tara: Yeah. she's, um, she's really cool.

Faith [Buffy] nods and blinks slowly.

Faith [Buffy]: (grins) So Willow's not driving stick anymore. Who would have thought? I guess you never really know someone until you've been inside their skin. And Oz is out of the picture? Oh, never seen two people so much in love. She just couldn't get enough of old Oz.

Tara: She, um, said he, uh, uh, w-w-w-w-w-went

Faith [Buffy]: He w-w-w-w-what? You gonna get that sentence out sometime tonight?

Tara lowers her head.

Willow returns.

Willow: Buffy, guy in the corner.

Faith [Buffy] looks at a guy leading a girl.

Faith [Buffy]: Yeah. Good call.

Tara: What?

Willow: Vampire.

Faith [Buffy]: Wicked obvious. (leans back and realizes Willow is waiting.) So I should slay him. (gets up.)

Willow: You want help?

Buffy: Nah, I got it.

Faith [Buffy] picks up a pool stick as she walks. She enters a back area where

the vampire is feeding on the girl from behind, making slurping noises

and holding the girl's arms. The girl is gasping. Faith [Buffy] breaks the pool

stick in two and drops one end. The girl's arms flail. Faith [Buffy] hits the

vampire in the back using the stake as a club.

Faith [Buffy]: Hey!

The vampire lets the girl fall and turns. Faith [Buffy] blocks a right and a left. She kicks it in the leg and spins the vampire around and holds it. She stakes it and throws it to the side just before it dusts.

Faith [Buffy] exhales and looks down at the girl. She is squatting and

she looks up at Faith [Buffy].

Faith [Buffy]: You'll live.

Girl: Uh he was so strong, uh.

Faith [Buffy]: Yeah, well, he's gone now.
Faith [Buffy] turns and the girl grabs her hand.

Girl: Thank you. (earnestly) Thank you.
Expressions flash across Faith [Buffy]'s face.

Faith [Buffy]: Yeah. (Shrugs) It's cool. (Shrugs)

Faith [Buffy] walks off and drops the stake.

Willow: Everything poofed?

Faith [Buffy]: All's well in the world.

Willow: Tara's not feeling well. I'm gonna walk her home.

Willow looks back at Tara.

Faith [Buffy]: Yeah. You give her whatever she needs.

Faith [Buffy] smiles for a second.

Willow: Are you gonna be in later, or you going over to Riley's?

Faith [Buffy] blinks several times and then smiles.

Cut to warehouse.

Banging sounds.

Smith walks toward the armored truck with a syringe.

Smith: This'll bloody keep you quiet.

Smith opens the back of the truck and goes in.

Buffy [Faith] grabs him and gets him in a chokehold with the chains.

Smith: Ugh.

Buffy [Faith]: How about this? I'll be quiet, and you can scream.

Smith: Aaahh.

Weatherby and Collins look in from the back of the truck.

Buffy [Faith]: Now you unchain me - very slowly And! politely, or I kill this guy.

Collins: When we go on a job, we always put our affairs in order first, in case of accident.

Smith: Collins...

Collins: Sorry, Smithy.

They walk off.

Collins: She's starting to bother me.

Weatherby: Getting her across the border is gonna be a lot more trouble

than it's worth.

Collins: If the council can even get us passage. I'll call them. It's time for a contingency plan.

Smith flies out the back of the truck and falls, groaning.

Cut to Riley's room.

Riley is sitting at his desk and hears a sound and turns, smiling. Faith [Buffy] is standing in the doorway.

Faith [Buffy]: Hi, baby.

*** ACT 3 ***

Cut to Tara's room.

Willow: I'm sorry you're feeling all blechy. But we'll get together with Buffy another time. Sometime soon. I think you'll really like her.

Tara sighs.

Tara: She's not your friend.

Willow: I may have overestimated the "you liking her" factor.

Tara: No, no. I mean, I don't... (sighs) I don't think she's...her.

Willow: You lost me.

Tara: Well, um, a person's energy has a flow, a unity. (sighs) Buffy's was (sighs) was fragmented. It-it grated, like something forced in where it doesn't belong. Plus, she was, um, (sighs) she was kind of mean. (laughs sadly)

Willow: So you think Buffy's not herself? Like she's been possessed

or something?

Tara: (sighs) I'm not sure.

Willow: You didn't sense a hyena energy at all, did you? Because hyena possession is just...unpleasant.

Tara: Do you have anything of hers?

Willow: Of Buffy's? Uhhhh. Oh! This ring.

Tara: I-I think there's a way we can, hmm... (reaches for book) The passage to the nether realm. There-there's a ritual. If you can find Buffy there, you should be able to see.

Willow: If it'll help her.

Tara sighs.

Willow: What?

Tara: Well, the nether realm exists beyond the physical world. Accessing it is... I-it-it's kind of like astral projection. It's very intense. I'd have to be your anchor, keep you on this plane.

Willow: (nods) I trust you.

Tara: It-it's not like anything that we've ever...

Willow: (smiles) I trust you.

Cut to Riley's room.

Faith [Buffy]: You miss me?

Riley: I did, actually. Everything's ok?

Faith [Buffy]: Everything's great. (walks forward)

Riley: What about Faith?

Faith [Buffy]: Faith has a won a fabulous trip to England, and I (sits on Riley's lap, straddling him) got the consolation prize,

which is you.

Riley: So I don't have to worry about Faith showing up? Though I have to admit, I was kind of curious to meet her.

Faith [Buffy] holds Riley's hands and leans back, still straddling him.

Riley: Or I was until about 30 seconds ago.
Faith [Buffy] sits up.

Faith [Buffy]: Oh, you wouldn't have liked Faith. She's not proper and

joyless, like a girl should be. She has a tendency to give in to

her animal instincts.

Faith [Buffy] kisses Riley and nips his lip.

Riley: Door's open.

Faith [Buffy]: So?

Riley: So my fantasies don't tend to include a bunch of marines

staring in at me.

Faith [Buffy]: Oh, maybe they could learn something.

She kisses his neck and Riley gets up, walking to close the door.

He holds his left side with his right arm.

Faith [Buffy]: You're hurt.
Riley closes the door.

Riley: Ahh, um, not that bad, actually. I guess the, uh, drugs the

professor gave me really did make me stronger. I'm healing pretty quick.

Faith [Buffy]: Maybe we should take you for a test drive.

Riley: I wouldn't say no. (walks forward)

Faith [Buffy]: So...how do you want me?

She crawls on the bed looking away from Riley and turns around.

Riley: How do I?

Faith [Buffy]: Yeah. what do you wanna do with this body? What nasty little desire have you been itching to try out? Am I a bad girl? Do you wanna hurt me? (puts her arms on him.)

Riley: What are we playing at here?

Faith [Buffy] takes her arms off of him.

Faith [Buffy]: I'm Buffy.

Riley: Ok. then I'll be Riley.

Faith [Buffy]: Well, if you don't wanna play...

Faith [Buffy] starts to leave and Riley holds her.

Riley: Right. I don't wanna play.

Riley kisses her very gently and Faith [Buffy] responds.

Cut to Tara's room.

Willow closes the curtains

Tara puts her thumb on Willow's forehead, lips and chest.

Tara and Willow sit side by side facing opposite directions. They are cross-legged. They whisper while stroking their outer

arms as if to stir water.

Willow and Tara: Sightless sea, Ayala flows through the river in me. The inward eye, the sightless sea. Ayala flows through the river in me. The inward eye, the sightless sea. Ayala flows through the river in me. The inward eye, The sightless sea. Ayala flows through the river in me. The inward eye, The sightless sea...

Light forms from their hands and creates a circle of

clouds/light around them as both arcs meet in two places.

Willow and Tara: Ayala flows through the river in me.

They touch hands palm to palm, keeping their hands flat. They are

breathing heavily and are both sweating and glistening. The circle

of light rises to the level of their heads. Their breathing gets

heavier. They look at each other. Willow slowly falls back, closing her

eyes and breaking the hand contact. The circle of light goes higher

and higher. Willow arches her back and moans "unnh ohh".

Cut to Riley's room.

Riley is on top of Faith [Buffy], looking down at her.

Riley: I love you.

Faith [Buffy]: Ugh Get off. No. No. No! (pushing Riley away) Get-get off! No. Off me. Get off. No, no-o. G-get... (stands)

Riley: Buffy...What? What's wrong?

Faith [Buffy]: (gasping) Who are you? What do you want from h-her?

Riley: Should I not have...?

Faith [Buffy]: This is meaningless.

Riley: You're shaking. (gets up and puts a blanket on her)

Faith [Buffy] whimpers.

Riley: What happened?

Faith [Buffy]: Nothing. Nothing.

She puts her head against Riley's chest and her face goes into shadow.

Cut to sewers.

Adam stops pacing.

Adam: I have a gift no man has. No demon has ever had. I know why I'm here. I was created to kill. To extinguish life

wherever I find it. And I have accepted that responsibility. You have lived in fear and desperation because you didn't have

that gift. But it's time to face your fear.

A vampire sitting cross legged rises.

Vampire: Tell us what to do.

Adam: You are here to be my first. To let them know that I am coming.

Vampire: We're ready.

Adam: Then ask yourself, what is it? More than man, more than

anything else. What is the thing you fear?

Cut to Riley's room.

Faith [Buffy] puts on a shirt and fluffs her hair. She sees the clock reads 8 25 and she looks back between the clock and Riley.

Faith [Buffy] leaves.

Cut to downstairs.

Faith [Buffy] comes down the stairs.

Forrest: Hope you left him alive.

Faith [Buffy]: What?

Forrest: Boy's supposed to be on the mend. I don't see you letting him get much rest.

Faith [Buffy]: I think maybe you should stay out of other people's lives.

Forrest: We've got a mission here. Back when Riley could still think for himself...

Faith [Buffy]: You've got a mission? I've been fighting demons since

before you could shave.

Forrest: Yeah, you're a killer.

Faith [Buffy]: I am not a killer! I am the slayer! And you don't know the first thing about me.

Forrest: You really care what I think?

Faith [Buffy]: No. I don't care. (throws hands up) God, I don't care.
She leaves and the door closes.

Cut to inside of warehouse.

Collins: They can't get us passage. They've ordered the kill.

Collins screws a silencer onto a pistol.

Weatherby: Torch the place?

Collins: Get the gas.

Weatherby walks off.

Smith: She could've killed me. She didn't.

Collins: Lucky you.

Collins sticks the gun in the truck but Buffy [Faith] grabs the pistol and his hands with her feet and pulls him into the truck hard enough to stun him before he can react.

Buffy [Faith] pulls the gun to her hands and shoots the chains holding her.

Smith: (running away) Weatherby!

Buffy [Faith] shoots a lock and smashes into the driver's seat.

Buffy [Faith]: Keys, keys.

Weatherby: Stop her, you ponce.

Buffy [Faith] finds the keys. Weatherby rushes the truck and Buffy [Faith]

opens the door into him, knocking him out.

Buffy [Faith]: Ok, I'm good at this.

She shifts gears.

Buffy [Faith]: Ooh, drive.
Smith has found a gun and shoots at the truck but Buffy [Faith] drives the armored truck out through the wooden door, breaking it.

*** ACT 4 ***

Cut to Airport.

Woman behind counter hands ticket to Faith [Buffy].

Woman: Here, there you go.

Faith [Buffy]: Thank you.

Woman: You're welcome.

Cut to Giles' living room.

Giles is coming down his stairs carrying a plate and some cups.

Buffy [Faith]: Giles!

Giles: God!

Buffy [Faith]: Don't move. Ok, Giles, you have to listen to me very carefully. I'm not Faith.

Giles: Really?

Buffy [Faith]: Really.

Giles: Cause the resemblance is striking.

Giles inches backwards.

Buffy [Faith]: I know. Giles, you just have to... Stop inching. you were

inching.

Giles: Look, I-I know what you're going to say, and-and uh

Buffy [Faith]: I'm Buffy.

Giles: All right, I didn't know what you were going to say,

but that doesn't make you any less crazy.

Buffy [Faith]: Faith switched. I mean, she had some device. She switched

our bodies. Giles, I swear (runs hand through hair) it's me.

Giles: U-um, if-if you are Buffy, then, (sets plate and cups down) uh, then you'll let me tie you up w-without killing me - until we find out whether you're telling the truth.

Buffy [Faith]: Giles, Faith has taken my body, and for all I know,

she's taken it to Mexico by now. I-I don't have time for

bondage fun. Ask me a question. Ask me anything.

Giles: Who is president?

Buffy [Faith]: We're checking for Buffy, not a concussion.

Giles: Oh, yes, Alright. um...

Buffy [Faith]: Ugh, Giles, you turned into a demon, and I knew it was you. I mean can't you just look in my eyes and be all intuitive?

Giles: How did I turn into a demon?

Buffy [Faith]: Oh, cause, uh, Ethan Rayne. And-and you have a girlfriend

named Olivia, and you haven't had a job since we blew up the school,

which is valid lifestyle wise. I mean, it's not like you're a slacker

type, but... Oh, oh! when I had psychic power, I heard my mom think that you were

like a stevedore during sex. What? Do you want me to continue?

Giles: Actually, I beg you to stop.

Buffy [Faith]: What's a stevedore?

Giles: Alright, let's-- um, I need you to explain everything.

Buffy [Faith]: And I will, after we get Faith.

Willow and Tara enter.

Willow: Giles!

Buffy [Faith]: Will!

Willow: Oh, my god.

Buffy [Faith]: Willow, wait. you don't understand.

Willow: You're Buffy. You and Faith switched bodies, probably

through a Draconian Katra spell.

Giles: (to himself) She understands it better than I do.

Buffy [Faith]: How did you?

Willow: Tara. Tara, this is Buffy, only really this time.

Tara: Hi.

Willow: Tara's a really powerful witch.

Tara: Not really.

Willow: No, really. She knew right away that you weren't you. So we connected with the nether realms to find out what happened. And we conjured this. (Shows green glowing item in box.)

Buffy [Faith]: What is...

Willow: It's a Katra. Or the home-conjured version. It-it should switch you back, if you can get a hold of Faith.

Buffy [Faith]: Oh, thank God.

Telephone rings.

Giles: I'll get it.

Giles picks up phone.

Giles: Hello.

Buffy [Faith]: Do you know where Faith is?

Giles: Oh yes, uh, Buffy's here with uh, me. Actually, she--she's uh oh, all right.

Giles looks up at everyone.

Giles: Xander. Apparently there's a report on the television.

Giles turns on the tv.

News Announcer: ...and barricaded themselves in the church with at least 20 parishioners. One of the few who escaped described the three men as frighteningly disfigured, almost inhuman. So far, one escapee has since died of severe neck wounds.

Cut to airport.

Faith [Buffy] sees the report on another tv.

News Announcer: There is no report on the condition of the

parishioners still trapped inside, but their assailants have vowed

to kill all of them...

Faith [Buffy] looks down, then back up at the screen.

News Announcer: ...if police attempt to storm the church.

Cut to interior of church.

Vampire: It's hard to believe. I've been avoiding this place for so many years, and it's nothing. It's nice! It's got the pretty windows, the pillars... lots of folks to eat. Where's the thing I was so afraid of? You know, the Lord? He was supposed to be here. He gave us this address. Well, we'll just have to start killing off His people, see if He shows up.

Cut to exterior of church.

Sirens. Two police cars and an ambulance are parked outside. There are four uniformed policemen and possibly one in plainclothes. One has just put down a radio.

Riley: What'd he say?

Detective: He said I should defer command to you.

Riley: Then you hold your men until the reserves arrive. This is a military situation.

Detective: What, they got bombs in there?

Riley: Your men are not prepared to deal with them. Just trust me.

Siren. Riley walks nearer the church. He sees Faith [Buffy].

Riley: Buffy.

Faith [Buffy]: How many are in there?

Riley: We think there's three.

Faith [Buffy]: I can do three.

Riley tugs at her arm.

Riley: Not alone. Look wait for the troops to get here. They're still mobilizing.

Faith [Buffy]: How did you respond so fast?

Riley: I didn't. I was just late for church.

Faith [Buffy] shakes her head.

Faith [Buffy]: Look, when the troops get here, send 'em in, but I'm going.

Riley: I don't want you risking... (tugs at her arm)

Faith [Buffy]: Don't tell me what to do! I'm Buffy. I have to do this.

Riley: Then I'm coming with.

Faith [Buffy] pokes Riley near which he is hurt.

Riley: Ow!

Faith [Buffy]: I can't use you. someone comes out, you get 'em to safety. Unless they've got fangs.

Faith [Buffy] enters the church.

Cut to interior church.

Faith [Buffy] closes the door.

Vampire: I told the cops, they send anyone in, I start the whole massacre thing.

Faith [Buffy]: Well, I'm not the cops. I just come to pray.

Vampire: Now's a good time to start.

Faith [Buffy]: You're *not* gonna kill these people.

Vampire: Why not?

Faith [Buffy]: Because it's wrong.

Vampire #3 attacks from behind and is thrown up in the air. He collides with a column and he doesn't get up.

Vampire: You're the slayer.

Faith [Buffy]: The one and only.

Cut to outside church.

Giles is driving the armored truck. It stops and Willow, Tara and Buffy [Faith] jump out of the back.

Detective: You people, get out of here!

Willow: We've gotta get inside.

Detective: The police are handling this. Just back off right now.

Willow: But we can't, we've gotta, Y- you don't understand.

Giles and Buffy [Faith] exchange a glance.

Detective: Listen you have to clear the area.

Giles: (yelling) Damn it, man, we have to get inside.

Buffy [Faith] moves out of sight behind the armored truck.

Giles: Our, um, uh uh families are in there. Our, um, mothers and-and tiny, tiny babies.

Cut to  interior church.

Vampire: You think we're afraid of you? We're not afraid of anything anymore.

Faith [Buffy]: Then let all these people go, and all three of you can take me on.

Vampire: Heh. I got a better idea.

He swings at Faith [Buffy] and she dodges and hits him in the stomach, backhands his face and kicks him in the waist. He goes down. She kicks another vampire in the stomach and knocks him back. Then she kicks the vampire who hit the pillar and sends him flying. She drives the second vampire back with a series of punches as people flee. She breaks off some wood from the back of a pew and stakes the second vampire. She tosses him aside and he spins as he turns to dust. The vampire who hit the pillar flees and grabs a robe.

Cut to outside church.

The vampire in the robe runs into Riley. They fall and roll. They get up and he hits Riley in the face. Riley spins him and throws him

down and holds onto the robe. The sunlight dusts him.

Riley: You forgot your coat.

Buffy [Faith] runs up.

Buffy [Faith]: Riley.

Buffy [Faith] hugs Riley.

Riley: Ohh. It's ok, miss. Just get yourself out of harm's way.

Buffy [Faith]: Riley, it's me. Uh. Never mind. How many are in there?

Riley: Well...who are you?

Inside the last vampire breaks the stake lose from Faith [Buffy]'s grip

and throws her back against a pew.

Vampire: I have strength you couldn't dream of. (punches Faith [Buffy] in

the face) Adam has shown me the way, and there is (punches again) nothing aaaaahhhhhh.

He turns to dust. Buffy [Faith] is standing there with a stake. Faith [Buffy]

leaps to attack. They exchange punches and Faith [Buffy] is attacking

frenetically and she is slightly quicker. She knocks Buffy [Faith] down

but Buffy [Faith] comes back with an uppercut and knocks her back.

Buffy [Faith]: You can't win this.

Faith [Buffy]: Shut up! Do you think I'm afraid of you?

Faith [Buffy] grabs Buffy [Faith] and throws her down, then sits on top of her and starts punching her.

Faith [Buffy]: You're nothing. (punches Buffy [Faith] twice) Disgusting. (punches Buffy [Faith] twice)

Faith [Buffy] grabs Buffy [Faith]'s hair with both hands and bangs her head.

Faith [Buffy]: Murderous bitch. (bangs Buffy [Faith]'s head into the ground twice) You're nothing. (bangs Buffy [Faith]'s head into the ground more)

Faith [Buffy]: (switches back to punching) You're (now crying) disgusting.

Buffy [Faith] grabs Faith [Buffy]'s hand to stop a punch and their hands glow.

Now Buffy is in her own body. And Faith is in her own body.

Buffy falls back as their hands separate. Faith jumps up and runs off. The real Buffy sits,

stunned or shocked, and watches her leave.

Cut to Riley's room.

Buffy hangs up phone. She is sitting on the bed. Riley is sitting in a chair.

Buffy: She's gone. not a trace. Giles said the council guys have cleared out, too.

Riley: I don't understand. how could she have... (grunts) I mean, how's it possible?

Buffy: Magic.

Riley: There was something. I should've picked up on it. I should've just...

Riley looks away, not meeting real Buffy's eyes. She realizes.

Buffy: You slept with her.

Riley: (looks down) I slept with you.

Buffy stands.

Riley: Man, would I like to get my hands on her. Not in a sex way.

Buffy: I don't think she's coming back.

Riley: Guess she's had her fun.

Buffy: Yeah. Fun.

For a brief moment Buffy's face and Faith's face are superimposed together on the screen as Buffy fades out and Faith fades in.

Cut to train.
Faith is riding in a rail car with wooden sides. Train track sounds are heard.

End.
