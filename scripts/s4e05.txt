Night in a graveyard. Buffy is fighting with a vampire while Parker is

lying on the ground.

Parker: Buffy?

Buffy: Parker? Stay down.

She continues to fight the vamp while two other vampires grab Parker

and start hauling him away.

Parker: Buffy!

Buffy runs to Parker's rescue, knocking away the two vamps with high

kicks and fighting all three at the same time. Eventually she dusts

all three vamps. Parker walks up to her holding his arm.

Parker: Buffy, I don't know what to say. After the way I've treated

you, and now I owe you my life.

Buffy: It's nothing.

Parker: It's everything. You're everything. And I'm going to do

whatever it takes to get you to forgive me. Do you think one day you

might?

Girl: (giggling) Noooo.

Cut to Prof. Walsh's Psyche class. A girl is giggling beside Parker

while Buffy watches behind them.

Prof. Walsh: These are the things we want. Simple things. Comfort,

sex, shelter, food. We always want them and we want them all the

time. The id doesn't learn it doesn't grow up. It has the ego telling

it what it can't have and it has the superego telling it what it

should want. But the id works solely out of the pleasure principle. It

wants. Whatever social skills you've learned, however much we've

evolved, the pleasure principal is at work in all of us. So, how does

this conflict with the ego manifest itself in the psyche? What do we

do when we can't have what we want?

Cut back to the graveyard scene again. Buffy stakes all the vamps.

Parker: Buffy, I don't know what to say. After the way I've treated

you, and now I owe you my life.

Parker now has a bouquet of flowers and ice cream in his

hand.

Parker: Can you ever forgive me?

Cut to the campus during the day. Buffy is sitting at a table with

Willow studying. Xander holds a lighter up to Buffy.

Xander: Rough day? Come on Buff. Be a lonely drunk. Rough day?

Buffy: Stop flicking at me.

Xander: Work with me here. I'm finally an essential part of your

collegy life. No more looking down on the townie. I'm the new

bartender over at the pub. Got my lighter, my rag, my empathy face.

Willow: Aren't you two young to be a bartender?

Xander: Oh contraire, mon frere.

Buffy: Mon frere means brother.

Xander: Mon girlfrere. Behold. (holds up a fake id) Behold.

Willow: I don't believe this is entirely on the up and up.

Xander: What gives it away?

Willow: Looking at it.

Xander: Well no one's going to see it anyway. Now I'm the bartender. I

kick people out.

Buffy: You know there's more to it than wiping and kicking. Mixing

drinks for instance.

Xander: Well, I've seen cocktail. I can do the hippy-hippy shake.

Buffy: Well, even if I've had a pretend cigarette I couldn't tell you

my pretend problems. The real ones have clogged up my headspace.

Xander: Ooh unload em right here baby. Rough day? You wanna talk about

it? Shutting up now.

Willow: I'm pregnant by my stepbrother who'd rather be with my best

friend whose left me with no place to live. No food except this bottle

of wild turkey which I drank all up.

Xander looks confused.

Willow: That was me being tanked and friendless for ya.

Xander: Gets my Oscar nod.

Buffy: You know what? It's class time.

Xander: So are you going to come by tonight to the pub?

Willow: Oz. Bronze. Date.

Buffy: You know maybe, maybe he's just having trouble dealing. I mean,

don't guys sometimes put the girl they really, really like inside

these deep little brain fantasy bubbles where everything's perfect? They do that right?

Xander: How's that fugue state coming along.

Willow: Parker.

Buffy: Maybe I'm in his bubble and then pretty soon he's going to

realize that he wants more than just bubble Buffy and he'll pop me out

and we'll go to dinner and it could happen right?

Willow: Buffy. And as my best friend you need to stop thinking about

Parker. He's no good. There are men, better men, wherein the mind is

stronger than the penis.

Xander: Nothing can defeat the penis! Too loud, very unseemly.

Willow: I mean, I'm sorry do be so course but I feel strongly about

stinky Parker man.

Buffy: He can be really sweet. I'm telling you I think he had intimacy

problems because of the death of his father.

Willow: Not interested. You got troubles, tell em to the bartender.

Xander: That's right. Cause the bartender's always ready to listen.

Cut to the pub.

Xander: What? What? Okay and you had a rum and coke, and you had a

poker's light. And a vodka on the rocks. And a water. Is that right?

Boy Customer: Do I have to write it down for you. A glass of ice

water. A simple request? Ice water.

Girl Customer: A cold ale, a Canadian lager, a glass of white

wine. And a daiquiri.

Xander: Ice water, right. Do you want that on the rocks?

Buffy walks in and sees Parker talking to a girl. She walks right into Riley, spilling his drink on him.

Buffy: Oooh. Riley, I'm so sorry.

Riley: That's okay you know, but most people go around. I'm not

saying you can't go through me, It's just that the other is much

quicker.

Buffy: In my defense you do take up a lot of space.

Riley: I do. I'm... You looking for someone?

Buffy: Um, I just saw Parker over there.

Riley: right. Parker and his latest conquest. You know that boy should

have...

Buffy: He's kinda a girl chaser huh?

Riley: Sets em up and knock's em down. I guess maybe I'm old-fashioned

but my father says that if you wanna be a gentleman you...

Riley sees that she's ignoring him.

Riley: Don't even care what my father says.

Buffy: I'm sorry what?

Riley: Forget about it. You know I've got some people waiting. I'll

see you in class right?

Riley leaves. Buffy sees Parker and the girl making out and goes to

leave.

Cut to Xander at the bar. Two girls are talking. Xander flicks his

cigarette lighter at a one of the girls.

Xander: Rough Day?

Girl: Nay, it's been super. We accepted Melody's pledge. And made her

an official sister of Beta Delta Gamma. And our pins arrived today. I

designed it myself.

Xander: You are so sharp.

Guy: Hey Paula. You keeping this fine bartender from his duty? A man's

gotta make a living.

Xander: S'all right.

Guy: So the guys and I are about to celebrate.

Xander: Uh, I said it was all right. I'm due for a break.

Guy: Oh, so what were you discussing. Maybe we could all join.

Paula: Be nice.

Guy: What?

Xander: Ah, forget it.

Guy: Oh, no I rudely interrupted and it sounds like the two of you

were having quite the meeting of minds. Possibly debating the

geopolitical ramifications of bioengineering. You got a take on that?

Xander: I've got beer. You want some beer.

Guy: Yeah, a pitcher of Black Frost. You see I think we have a perfect

venue here for conducting a little sociometry. A bipolar continuum of

attraction and rejection. No given your sociological statuses. I

foresee a B rejects A dyad. I'm sorry, lemme clarify. You see, we are

the future of this country and you keep our bowl of peanuts full. We

are what these girls want. And uh, four glasses.

Xander: How's about I see some ID cause you're not seeing a drop until

I'm satisfied that.

Bartender: Just give em a beer.

Xander pours a pitcher for them and leaves.

Cut to Buffy sitting alone at the bar. Xander sees her and comes over.

Xander: Buffy? Rough day? Wanna tell me about it?

Buffy: It's just. Parker's problem with intimacy turns out to be that

he can't get enough of it. And knew it. I knew what he was. If he were

tied and gagged and left in a cave that vampires happen to frequent it

wouldn't really be like I killed him really.

Xander: Buffy.

Buffy: I'm a slut.

Xander: No.

Buffy: Idiot.

Xander: No. You gotta stop being so hard on.

Bartender: Hey.

Xander: Sorry, so sorry.

Buffy: I'm better. This has helped.

Xander: Do NOT go anywhere.

She gets up to leave when a guy bumps into her.

Buffy: Oh, oh. I'm so sorry I just keep running into people today.

Guy #2: I can't imagine anybody minding. You're not thinking about

leaving are you? Because we have a strict policy against you

leaving. At least until you've had a drink.

Guy #1: Yeah, well what my friend is just saying is you shouldn't be

sad and alone right now. I mean you're a very beautiful girl who

should be covered with men. And, could we be those men? It's on us.

Buffy sees Parker leaving with the girl. She smiles at the guys and

takes a beer from them.

Cut to the Bronze.

Oz is walking through the crowd with two drinks in his hands. Willow

is sitting at a table.

Oz: Hey. You got a table.

Willow: I had to kill a man.

Oz: Well, it's a really good table.

Willow: I copied out my notes for Psyche since you were so elsewhere

this morning.

Oz: Thanks

Willow: It's really pretty simple stuff. You know, just what's the

matter.

Oz: I dunno. I feel It's nothing.

They look at the stage where Veruca appears and starts singing. Oz is

entranced and Willow notices. It seems like Veruca is singing right to

Oz.

Willow: We could go back to your place. I could make you soup.

Oz: No. That's okay I'm fine. Thanks.

They continue watching the band. Willow is getting uncomfortable.

Willow: Do you know her?

Oz: Veruca? No. I know their drummer. He's cool. I've never heard them

play.

Things get more intense. Oz is mesmerized by Veruca.

Cut to the pub. Buffy is chugging a beer.

Guys: Chug, chug, chug, chug.

Buffy finishes the beer and burps.

Guy #1: The thing that the modern day society failed to realize is that

all the socio-economical and psychological problems inherent in

modern society can be solved by the judicious application of way too

much beer.

Guy #2: Black frost is the only beer.

Buffy: My mother always said that beer was evil.

Guy #1: Evil. Good. These are moral absolutes that predate the

absolution of malt and fine hops. You see, wait where was I?

Buffy: I'm really not sure.

Guy #4: Well, Thomas Equines and...

All the other guys stop him saying “NO”.

Guy #2: There will be no Thomas Equines at this table.

Guy #3: Keep your theology of providence to yourself frat boy.

Guy #4: I was just drawing a parallel between...

Guy #1: Beer. Had the earliest morality developed under the influence

of beer there would be no good or evil. There would just be kinda nice

and pretty cool. Everything would be different.

Buffy: You guys really like to hear yourselves speak don't ya.

Guy #1: Alright we're losing her guys

Guy #2: Say something interesting.

Guy #3: Tell us about yourself

Guy #2: Yeah, what do you like.

Buffy: Well, I don't hate this for a start.

Cut to Buffy and Willow's dorm room the next day. Willow walks in from

the bathroom with a towel over her shoulder and her bath stuff in

hand. She seems upset.

Willow: My name's Veruca. I'm in a band. I'm Oz, I'm in a band

too. Oh, and this is Willow. Oh, how fun and creepy. Groovy. Buff,

have you heard of this Veruca chick? Dresses like Faith, voice like an

albatross.

Buffy: (watching MTV) TV is a good thing. Bright colours. Music. Tiny

little people.

Willow: What did you do with Buffy.

Buffy: I'm suffering the afterness of a bad night of badness.

Willow: You didn't. Not with Parker again.

Buffy: No, with four really smart guys.

Willow: Four? Oh. Ow. Oh Buffy, are you okay? Do you wanna talk about

it?

Buffy: I went to see Xander. Then I saw Parker. Then came beer.

Willow: And then group sex?

Buffy: (hits her) Gutter face. No! Just lots and lots of beer. It's

nice. Foamy. Comforting. It's just beer.

Willow: Drowning your troubles over Parker. Mind frying man! He

deserves a slow and torturous death by spider-bites. Well, for today

we'll just have to throw spitballs at his neck in class.

Buffy: Okay. (gets up to leave in her pjs)

Willow: Uh (stops her) getting dressed would be fun to.

Cut to Prof. Walsh's class.

Prof. Walsh: Next class we'll be moving on to personality types and

disorders. For those of you who have done the reading you already know

(sees Buffy's hand up) yes?

Buffy: She read the reading.

Prof. Walsh: well, she'll have some time on her hands. As I was

saying. We won't be able to cover it all in the class but that doesn't

mean it isn't work knowing and it doesn't mean it won't be on the

midterm. Now, if I've been unclear in any way. Speak now.

Buffy sees a girl eating a sandwich and she grabs it out of her hands

and starts to eat it.

Willow: Buffy! Buffy are you okay?

Prof. Walsh: Good. Now before you go. Make sure you get the complete

worksheet from the TA. Based on that do and hand them to me at the

start of the class on Monday. 

Buffy: (with her mouth full) Yeah, why

wouldn't I be.

Cut to a lab where someone is brewing something in beakers. See a

glove turn a knob and fluid run down a tub into a vat of Black Frost

beer (what Buffy was drinking the night before).

Cut to commercial.

Cut to pub that night. Buffy is watching Guy #1 pour beer into her

glass.

Buffy: This good. Ooh, good enough.

Guy #1: Still more is good.

Buffy: Yeah. Foamy.

Guy #3: You should come to our class on big thinking. It's good.

They all laugh. Cut to Xander at the bar. A girl approaches with a

cigarette.

Girl: Boy, I'm having the worst day. You got a light?

Xander points to a no-smoking sign.

Guy #1: I like girls.

Buffy: You stupid.

Guy #1: No, you stupid.

Buffy: Smelly head.

Guy #1 pushes Guy #2 over. They all laugh and Xander looks on kinda

concerned.

Cut to the dorm. Oz walks up to Willow as she comes out of her room.

Oz: Willow. Hey. I tried calling.

Willow: Yeah, I've been up at the library. How are you feeling?

Oz: What do you mean?

Willow: Well, you weren't in class. Again.

Oz: Yeah, I was practicing. Hey Shy's playing again tonight.

Willow: Shy?

Oz: Yeah, Veruca's band and they asked me to sit in with them. It

would be kinda cool if you were there.

Willow: Two Veruca shows in two nights. Are you sure you wanna share

your groupie? I think I'm gonna study. Because of the fun.

Oz: Well, yeah I guess how I could see it be dull for ya.

There's an uncomfortable silence between them and Oz looks confused

at Willow being so distant and cold.

Willow: See ya. (turns around and leaves)

Oz: Yeah. (looks hurt and leaves)

Cut to the pub. Everyone is gone but the group Buffy is with.

Guy #1: Stupid.

Guy #2: No, you stupid.

Buffy: No you. (and them all laugh)

Xander puts some music on the jukebox.

Buffy: You. (and them all laugh)

Buffy: Hey! 

She runs over to him and looks confused. She bangs on the

jukebox and laughs.

Buffy: Thing. Like it.

Xander: It's time to go home Buffy

Buffy: Want more singing. Want more beer

Xander: No, I've cut you off.

Buffy: Did it hurt.

Xander: Out you go.

Xander picks her up and starts carrying her to the door. She

struggles. Final she walks to the door with him.

Buffy: Ow, oh, want beer. Like beer. Beer good.

Xander: Beer Bad. Bad, bad beer. What the hell am I saying? Buffy, go

home and go to bed.

Buffy: Say bye. (pushes him)

Xander: Bye.

Buffy: Bye. (leaves)

Guy #1: Hey, where'd girl go?

Cut to another part of the pub. Willow walks in and sees Parker

stirring coffee. She approaches him.

Parker: Hey. Did you want something?

Willow: Yes. I wanted to give you a piece of my mind. I'm tired of you

men and your manness. Buffy's really hurting right now. In fact she's

in need of a big mental tidy. Parker how could you do this to her?

Parker: Oh, I don't get what you mean. What did I do?

Willow: She shared something very intimate with you. And you act like

it's nothing more than a bag of some kind of snack food.

Parker: Willow, I'm not sure I need to explain my actions here but if

that's what you want.

Willow: Yes followed by an admission of undeniable guilt. But go

on. (sits down with him)

Parker: Some relationships center on a deep emotional tie. Or a loyal

friendship. Or something. But most are just two people passing through

life enriching or aggravating each other's lives briefly.

Willow: Go on.

Parker: Just for one night can't two people who feel an attraction

come together and create something wonderful? And then go back to

their lives the next day better for it but never over analyzing it or

wanting it to be more than it was? I have. She should too.

Willow: People like Buffy a-and me assume that intimacy means

friendship and respect. People shouldn't have to ask first if you're

going to be eyeing other prospects tomorrow.

Parker: People shouldn't have to preface casual sex with “just so you

know I'll never grow any older with you.” It takes the fire out of it.

Willow: Maybe.

Parker: Willow, I don't regret what happened. Or what we did. But I am

sorry that Buffy's hurting and if I mislead her than I'm sorry for

that too I didn't mean to. I'm impressed that you care so much about

her. You're a good friend.

Cut back to the guys. They are getting more apelike.

Xander comes to clean the table and get paid for the drinks.

Xander: Alright, time to pay up and go home guys.

They throw money at him. Guy #1 leaves to go to the washroom. Xander

continues cleaning and picks up a wad of cash from the table.

Xander: Let's see, I'll take this one, and this one. And you know I've

always had a problem calculating the tip and you guys being so dapper

and brain, maybe you can help me out. Okay great. See if your bill

comes to thirty-eight dollars and people tip what, approximately

thirty percent? That makes you tip what? (One of the guys gives him

all the money). You are so smart. This is so the right amount. (hears

banging in the bathroom) Somebody didn't have their fiber today. Hey

are you alright in there? Buddy?

Guy #1 bursts out of the bathroom. He has become a Neanderthal. He

conks Xander over the head with a club.

Cut to Xander lying down and the Neanderthal guy on top sniffing his

unconscious form. Xander slowly wakes up and sees him. Cut to the

three other frat guys afraid and backing away.

Guy #2: Oh God

Guy #3: Let's get outta here!

Neanderthal frat Guy #1 yells in Xander's face and Xander yells

back. He gets up as the other frat guys begin to devolve into

Neanderthals as well.

Xander: (jumping up) Hey, hey, easy. We're cool.
They back him into a corner.

Xander: Help. Oh God. (pulls out his Zippo lighter and lights

it. The Neanderthals are all afraid of the fire and back away)

NG #1: Fire bad. Fire pretty.

Xander: Fire angry!
They all run away out the door in fear.

Xander closes the door behind them and calls his boss.

Xander: Jack! Jack! We've got a problem. The guys they-they're some of

the patrons are turning into cavemen.

Jack: They've had it comin. (puts some Black Frost beer on the

counter)

Cut to the campus. The cavemen are running around like apes, jumping

into trees and fighting.

Cut to the pub.

Jack: You know I've been taking abuse from snot-nosed kids for twenty

years. They're always coming in here with their snotty attitude,

drinking their fruity little micro brews and spouting out some

philosophy Like it means a damn thing. Thinking they're different than

us. 

Xander: They are now.

Jack: They ain't. That's the great thing about beer. It makes all men

the same.

Xander: Why are we talking about beer the guys are the beer.

Jack: Neat huh? My brother-in-law's a warlock. He showed me how to do

it.

Xander: No. No neat. I served them that beer. I served Buffy that

beer! Uh, how much beer would you say a person would need to consume

before they start seriously questing for fire?

Jack: Relax. It will wear off in a day or so.

Xander: In a day or so someone is going to get killed. You're a bad,

bad man.

Cut to outside. The Neanderthals see cars. One stands in the middle of

the road and gets hit by a car. He is seriously injured. The driver

jumps out to see if he's okay.

Car guy: I didn't see him, is he okay?

He sees what they are and runs away in fear. The other cavemen smash

the car, then chase some girls down the street while the injured one

remains on the street in pain.

Cut to Buffy's dorm. Xander and Giles are walking through the halls.

Xander: Well, I cut her off before the others so I don't think she had

as much to drink.

Giles: I can't believe you served Buffy that beer.

Xander: I didn't know it was evil.

Giles: But you knew it was beer.

Xander: Well excuse Mr. “I spent the sixties in an electric Kool-Aid

funky Satan groove”.

Giles: It was the early seventies and you should know better.

Xander: I'm not the dad of her. Buffy's a grown up. It wasn't enough

to.

They see Buffy in her room drawing cave pictures on her walls. She

looks at them with a wild look and bangs on the picture she has drawn

of a man on the wall.

Buffy: Parker bad.

Cut to the pub where Parker and Willow have moved to a couch and are

still talking.

Parker: I don't mean this in a bragging way but I do get to know a lot

of women.

Willow: Well, getting to know people is good.

Parker: But I haven't found the one yet. I've yet to find the girl

that I can just sit with. Feel totally at ease. Feeling whatever's on

my mind. Or even sit with comfortably in silence. Willow, can I tell

you something kinda private?

Willow: Okay, I mean I feel you've shown me a perspective I haven't

really thought much about before. What was it you wanted to tell me?

Parker: Just that I've enjoyed talking to you. Here. Tonight.

Willow: Me too. I mean, with you. You know, I'm wondering

something. About you.

Parker: What?

Willow: Just how gullible do you think I am? I mean with you gentle

eyes and your shy smile and your ability to talk openly even to me!

You're unbelievable!

Parker: What?

Willow: This isn't sharing. This isn't connecting. It's the pleasure

principle. That's right I got your number ID boy. The only thing

you're thinking about is how long you can jump on my bones.

Parker: Look, if you think that I'm.

Willow: I mean, you men. It's all about the sex! You find a woman,

drag her to your den, do whatever's necessary just as long as you get

the sex. I tell you men haven't changed since the dawn of time.

The cavemen break in with the girls in tow.

Willow: You see?

They knock Willow down and hit Parker with a stick.

Cut to Buffy's room again.

Giles: Fascinating really.

Buffy's going around on a chair and then falls on the floor. She goes

to the TV.

Buffy: Want people. Where people go?

Giles: The TV is off.

Buffy: Want! Want people.

Giles: She doesn't appear to be in any danger. Maybe you should stay

with her.

Buffy sniffs Xander.

Giles: or perhaps she should be left alone.

Buffy: Boy smells nice. (grabs him and sniffs him)

Xander: Yeah, I think we need to track down the fun boys somewhat

pronto. Jack said the effects of the beer would wear off.

Buffy: Beer? Buffy want beer.

Giles: You can't have beer.

Buffy gives Giles an evil look.

Buffy: Want beer.

Xander: Giles, don't make cave slayer unhappy.

She fakes a punch at Giles.

Buffy: Buffy strong.

Giles: Yes, Buffy strong.

Buffy: Buffy get beer.

Giles: Buffy get.

Buffy tackles him, pushes Xander out of the way and runs out of the

room.

Xander: Giles!

Giles: I'm fine. Just get her.

Xander: Which way?

Giles: Um, check down there. We have to find her before someone gets

hurt.

Cut back to the pub the caveman have knocked willow out and have made

a shambles of the place. There is a fire spreading. Caveguy #1 is

leaning over Willow's unconscious form.

Caveguy #1: Woman. Man.

Caveguy #2: (waving a stick in the air) Woman!

Cut to commercial.

Cut to the pub. Caveguys finally realize the pub is on fire and start

to panic, not knowing what to do.

Cut to Xander running across campus.

Xander: Buffy! Buffy!

He spots her and approaches her. She looks confused.

Xander: Aha can't find the beer. Good. Freshman girls unable to hold

the beer shouldn't have it. Get into trouble.

Buffy jumps away from him.

Xander: Hey, we're good. Remember the boy? Boy smells good yeah? Is

there any part of Buffy still in there.

Buffy starts to sniff. They turn and see smoke.

Xander: Oh no.

Buffy: Fire bad!

She runs towards the pub.

In the pub the Neanderthals have gathered all the girls in a corner

and continue to prance around, not knowing what to do. Buffy breaks in

but can't get through the flames. She sees a fire extinguisher and

gets it but is too far gone to know what to do with it so just throws

it into the fire. Then she sees Willow's unconscious form and

something clicks inside. She jumps over the flames and to Willow. Xander runs inside.

Xander: Buffy?!

Xander runs back outside because there is too much smoke.

Xander: Where the hell is Giles?

Cut to Giles talking to a student.

Giles: Blonde. Um, about this tall. Walks with a sort of a sideways

limp.

Cut back to the pub.

Buffy: Bad. Bad.

Buffy sees windows. She jumps up and works her way across some pipes

until she can bust the window open. The Neanderthals take cue and

start knocking things over so they can make a stairway to the

window. They all run out and the girls follow them. Buffy drags Willow

out and up to the window where Xander is helping the girls outside.

Xander: Are you alright?

Willow: Buffy's still in there.

Back inside Buffy sees Parker. He's awake and coughing. He doesn't see

Buffy who is looking at a big stick with a lot of interest.

Parker: Oh God. Help me. I can't breathe. (sees her). Buffy. Oh

god, what do we do?

Buffy clubs him over the head with a stick. She grabs his arm.

Cut to outside the pub. Xander and Giles stand beside a bench where

Willow sits and Buffy hovers over her protectively.

Xander: Did you guys have enough fun for one night?

Willow: Yes. Please.

Buffy: Buffy tired.

Xander: And was there a lesson in all this huh? What did we learn

about beer?

Buffy: Foamy.

Xander: Good, just as long as that's clear. Anyways I think that the

boys in the car are contained for the time being. This will give them

some time to ponder the geopolitical ramifications of BEING MEAN TO ME!

Buffy walks up to a van and sees the Neanderthals inside. She bangs on

the windows getting their attention.

Giles: Whose van is that?

Xander: I dunno. Wasn't locked.

Parker walks up to her alive and well.

Parker: Buffy. Buffy I I dunno how to say this. I'm sorry for how I

treated you before. It was wrong of me and I'm sorry. You were great

tonight, really. I might not deserve this but do you think that you

could forgive me?

Buffy wacks him with the club again and knocks him out.

The gang gathers around and looks at him. Buffy walks back towards the

van but Xander guides her away with the others.

The end.
