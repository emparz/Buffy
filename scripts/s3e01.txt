*** Prologue ***

The Sunnydale cemetery at night. The camera fades in on a gravestone--

Andrew Hoelich, 1981-1998--and slowly pans down to the ground in front of it. A bouquet

of fresh flowers is there. A hand comes out of the freshly filled grave

and claws for solid ground. Slowly Andrew pulls himself out of his

grave, now a newly made vampire. He growls when his head clears the

earth, and continues to climb out on his stomach. He crawls along the

ground, pulling out his legs as the camera pulls back, and stops when he

sees a pair of wide-spread legs standing before him. He looks up to see

who it is.

Willow: That's right, Big Boy.

Cut to Willow.

Willow: (smiles mischievously) Come and get it.

Andrew suddenly hops to his feet and roars at her. Taken aback by this,

Willow takes a few quick steps backward. The vampire takes two steps

toward her. Xander grabs him by the collar of his suit and pulls him

back away from Willow. Andrew loses his balance in the process.

Xander: I got him! Go!

Oz jumps out from behind a bush and starts to run toward them, but then

hesitates a moment to get a stake from his jacket pocket.

Xander: Any time now . . .

Andrew has regained his balance, and using Xander's grip to stabilize

himself, kicks up with both legs and does a double pike snapping kick to

Oz's face. Oz stumbles backward and falls. Without pausing, Andrew leaps

up again and does a back tuck over Xander's head. Xander tries to rush

him, but Andrew uses his momentum to deflect him into Willow. They both

go crashing to the ground. Willow moans, but quickly sits up to watch

Andrew run away.

Willow: He's getting away! And . . . ow.

Oz scrambles to his feet and picks up his stake. He watches the demon

running and holds his stake by the tip, preparing to throw it like a

knife. Andrew leaps over a rock and continues running. Oz throws the

stake. It whistles through the air as it flies end over end, and hits

a gravestone, bouncing off of it with a loud thunk and flying wild.

Oz: (shaking his head) That really never works.

Willow and Xander get up, and Oz turns to them.

Oz: Are you guys all right?

Xander: First of all, what was with the acrobatics? How did that

happen?

Oz: (looking in the direction that Andrew went) Wasn't Andy Hoelich on

the gymnastics team?

Xander: (gestures with his arm) That's right, he was! (shouting after

Andrew) Cheater!

Oz gives Xander a brief look and then stares into the distance again

looking for Andrew.

Xander: (to Willow) Okay, and the, uh, second problem I'm having . . .

'Come and get it, Big Boy'?

Willow: Well . . . (stammering) W-well, the Slayer always says a pun or-or

a witty play on words, and I think it throws the vampires off, and, and

it makes them *frightened* because I'm wisecracking. Okay, I didn't

really have a chance to work on that one, but *you* try it every time.

Oz: Uh, if I may suggest: 'This time it's personal.' I mean, there's a

reason why it's a classic.

Xander: (steps away) I've always been amazed with how Buffy fought,

but . . . (picks up his bag) in a way, I feel like we took her punning for

granted. (steps back)

Willow: (gives Xander a scolding look) Xander, past tense rule.

Xander: Oh, sorry. I just meant we in the past took it for granted and,

uh . . . we won't when she gets back.

Willow: Do you think Buffy knows school's starting tomorrow?

Oz: Tomorrow. (Willow looks at him) Right. Big day.

Willow: (goes to Oz) Oh, I'm gonna be busy a lot. But, but only till

3, and that's when you usually get up.

Xander: I can't wait to see Cordelia. (pauses) I can't believe I can't

wait to see Cordelia.

Willow: (smiling) I wonder what our first homework assignment's gonna

be.

Xander puts his hands on his hips and gives her a look.

Willow: Hey, you're excited over Cordelia, okay? We've all got issues.

Oz: I guess we should pack it in.

Xander: Yeah.

They all start to walk away from Andrew's grave.

Willow: Wouldn't it be great if Buffy just showed up tomorrow? Like

nothing happened?

Xander: She can't just show up, she got kicked out.

Willow: Well, yeah, I-I know. I just wish . . . I wish we knew where she

was.

Cut to a Los Angeles beach. A wave crashes on the sand. In the far

distance a pier stretches out into the water. Buffy steps into view,

walking barefoot across the sand. She stops and looks out over the

ocean. She closes her eyes and raises her head to just feel the sun on

her face and listen to the waves come in. The camera pans down from her

face to her waist. A pair of hands reach around her and clasp in front,

and she covers them with hers. The camera pans back up to her face. She

looks back at Angel leaning his head over her shoulder. She reaches up

with her hand and brushes it against his cheek.

Buffy: How did you find me here?

Angel: If I was blind, I would see you.

She lowers her hand to take his again at her waist and closes her eyes.

She embraces his arms tightly to her.

Buffy: Stay with me.

Angel: Forever. That's the whole point. I'll never leave. (whispering

into her ear) Not even if you kill me.

Buffy's expression turns from contented to dismayed.

Cut to Buffy's tiny apartment in a run-down downtown Los Angeles

neighborhood. She wakes from her dream and looks around sadly. Slowly

she gets up and goes over to the window overlooking the street below.

The camera pans away from the window, past the sidewalk and into the

street. A police siren gets louder as it nears, and an instant later an

LAPD squad car races across the intersection at the end of the block

against the red light.

Opening credits roll. Buffy's theme plays.

*** Part 1 ***

Behind the counter at a small, sleazy diner named Helen's Kitchen.

The cook puts two burgers with fries up on the pick-up counter. A

waitress walks past the counter to hang an order on the spinner. Buffy

walks behind her to pick up the two burgers. She has her hair in two

short braids to keep it out of the way. Her expression emotes a

combination of sadness and boredom. She takes the two plates, walks them

over to a nearby table and sets them down in front of two roughneck

types. They both eye her lecherously. Buffy takes out her order pad.

Buffy: Anything else?

Roughneck: That'll do us, Peaches.

She tears off their bill and puts it on the table.

Buffy: Pay at the counter.

Roughneck: Sure you don't want me to work it off for you?

The other roughneck laughs at that. Buffy walks away, and as she goes he

reaches out with his hand and slaps her on the behind. Buffy stops in

her tracks. The two men just chuckle. She turns her head slightly, but

thinks better of doing anything about it. She walks up to another table

where a young couple is sitting. They are too into each other to notice

Buffy.

Buffy: You guys ready?

Rickie: (still looking at his girl) Yeah. I think we're good. Um . . .

(looks at Buffy's name tag) 'Anne'.

Buffy glances at them briefly, then looks down at her pad to take their

order.

Buffy: What'll you have?

Rickie reaches into his pocket and pulls out a handful of change.

Rickie: Well, okay . . . What can we get with this?

He dumps the change onto the table. It's mostly pennies, a few nickels

and dimes, no quarters.

Buffy: Um . . .

Lily: (to Rickie) Can we get cake?

Rickie: (to Lily) Don't be stupid. We gotta eat healthy. We can't have

cake. (to Buffy) Can we get pie?

Buffy: We've got a peach pie. (writes the order) I can't guarantee

there's a peach in it.

Lily: (to Rickie) We shouldn't have blown all our money.

Rickie: (to Lily) Come on, it was worth it.

Lily smiles. Rickie looks up at Buffy as the two of them hold out their

forearms.

Rickie: Hey, check this out.

Buffy looks at their arms as they hold them out together and sees they

each have a tattoo of half of a heart with a ribbon across it. On their

respective halves of the ribbon they have the other's name tattooed.

Buffy: It's nice. It's nice and, uh, permanent. (smiles weakly)

Rickie: (looking at Lily) Yeah, forever. (puts his arm around Lily) I

mean, that's the whole point.

Lily looks at him and smiles. Buffy looks down sadly. A moment later she

looks up at Lily, and there's a spark of recognition in her face. Lily

looks up at Buffy and thinks she also recognizes her.

Lily: Hey, do I know you?

Buffy: (looks away) I don't think so.

Lily: (looks harder) Really? Where're you from?

Buffy: (avoids the issue) I'll get your pie.

Lily watches as Buffy goes to the cash register. Rickie distracts her,

and they are in their own little world again. At the register Buffy puts

down the order. The other waitress looks at her.

Buffy: I'm not feeling great. (unties her apron) Do you think you can

cover for me?

Waitress: Sure. (looks at the order) Okay.

Buffy gives Rickie and Lily one last look and goes out of the diner.

Cut to the Sunnydale High School library. Students are busy looking for

books they will need during the semester. Willow and Giles walk out of

the stacks on the mezzanine level. Willow has several books in her arms.

Giles: So, no joy at the cemetery?

They come down the stairs.

Willow: No, he got away. We still have some glitches in the system,

like . . . vampires getting away. But I think we're improving. (smiles)

They split up as Giles heads through the door to go behind the check-out

counter.

Giles: For God's sake be careful. (they meet at the counter) I mean,

uh, I appreciate your efforts to keep the vampire population down until

Buffy returns, but, uh . . . Well, if anything should happen to you and . . .

you should be killed, I should take it somewhat amiss.

Giles scans Willow's books to check them out.

Willow: You'd be cranky?

Giles: Entirely.

Willow: Well, we try not to get killed. (the phone in Giles' office

rings) That's part of our whole mission statement. 'Don't get killed.'

She takes the books and stacks them together again.

Giles: Good, good. (taps on one of her books) I think you're going to love

that one. (goes to get the phone)

Willow picks the books up and starts out of the library. Before she can

take more than a few steps, Cordelia comes up to her.

Willow: Hi!

Cordelia: Hey, Willow. (puts her bag on the counter)

Willow: How was your summer?

Cordelia: Oh, I can't believe you brought that up. Las Palmas was the

nightmare resort. They order you around and make you have organized

(makes quotes with her fingers) 'fun', and I used sarcastic quote marks.

(takes her bag and starts out) Plus the fact there are cockroaches in

Mexico big enough to own property. It was all about dread. How was your

summer?

Willow: Oh, it was okay.

They walk through the library doors and into the hall.

Cordelia: Is Xander around?

Willow: Well, uh, yeah. Somewhere.

They stop in the hall.

Cordelia: Good. Great. I haven't seen him yet. (pulls her hair behind

her ears) Do I look okay?

Willow: Oh, yeah! (nods and smiles)

Cordelia: (worried) How's my hair?

Willow: Uh, it's good! (smiles)

Cordelia: He didn't meet anybody over the summer, did he? No, who's he

gonna meet in Sunnydale, but monsters and stuff? But then again he's

always been attracted to monsters. (worried) How's my hair?

Willow: Still good.

She turns to leave and sees Oz.

Willow: (smiles hugely) Hi!

Cordelia grabs her arm and turns her around to look at her.

Cordelia: Maybe he's forgotten me. (lets go) Well, I'll just have to

make him remember. (smiles) See ya. (walks off)

Willow: (turns back to Oz) You came to visit me. (sees his books) You

came with books? Are they books for me?

Oz: Well, actually, they're kind of for me.

Willow: I don't get it.

Oz: Well, it's sort of a funny story. (they walk) You remember when I

didn't graduate?

Willow: Well, I know you had a lot of incompletes, but that's what

summer school was for.

Oz: Yeah. Well, you remember when I didn't go?

Two students run past them, and the camera follows them down the hall

past a teacher.

Teacher: Whoa. Slow down, people. (they stop running) Summer is over.

Be somber.

Willow and Oz walk by as the teacher goes back into his classroom.

Willow: But you never said anything. How am I supposed to react to this

rather alarming news?

Oz: Well, actually, I was pretty much banking on you finding it cute.

Willow: Well, traditionally, you know, repeating a grade isn't exactly

a turn-on. (they stop by the lounge) A-and you're practically a genius.

You're Mr. Test Scores. I-it's all a little weird.

Oz: So the cute thing is out?

Xander rushes up to them.

Xander: Have you guys seen Cordelia?

Willow: Yeah. She's around here somewhere.

Xander: I don't want to come on too geeky, but, uh, okay, I'm psyched! (flashes a big grin) There's gonna be some heat, if you know what I

mean, so you guys might want to duck and cover. (Willow sighs) And I'm

starting to be geeky. (grins again) Okay, bye. (he goes, but comes right

back) How's my--

Willow: (interrupts) Your hair is fine.

Xander: (big grin) Cool. (darts away)

Larry and another jock walk behind Willow and Oz, and the camera follows

them into the lounge.

Larry: This is our year, I'm telling you. Best football season ever.

I'm so in shape, I'm a rock. (they stop by the vending machines) It's

all about egg whites. If we can focus, keep discipline, and not have

quite as many mysterious deaths, Sunnydale is gonna *rule*!

Willow and Oz walk into the lounge on the other side of the tables.

Willow: I'm trying to get to cute, really. But I'm still sorta stuck on

'strange'.

Oz: Well, I'd be willing to bargain down to 'eccentric' with an option

on 'cool'.

They walk past the raised area where the couches are. Behind them Xander

and Cordelia finally meet. The camera closes in on them.

Xander: Hey!

Cordelia: Hey.

Xander: Good summer?

Cordelia: It was all right.

Xander: Cool!

Cordelia: (sounding disappointed) Yeah.

They stand around looking uncertain for a moment.

Xander: Well, I'll see ya.

Cordelia: Yeah, whatever.

He turns and goes down the steps. Cordelia walks the other way toward

the hall.

Cut to Buffy's apartment. She's sitting calmly on the edge of her bed in

her nightshirt, holding a can of Spaghetti-O's in her lap. The camera

pans up from the can to her face. She just stares blankly into the room,

breathing calmly.

Cut to the street in front of Helen's Kitchen. Buffy walks along the

street. A homeless man is sitting on the curb. Ken, the local shelter

operator, approaches the man and crouches down beside him, holding out

one of his leaflets.

Ken: Hey, how are you? Can I talk to you for a moment? I have something

you might be interested in.

Buffy continues walking and passes a store with a recessed entryway. A

homeless woman is cowering there.

Homeless woman: I'm no one.

Buffy looks at the woman.

Homeless woman: I'm no one.

Buffy looks away and hides her face from the woman by pulling her hair

behind her ear. Her expression becomes very sad.

Homeless woman: I'm no one.

Cut to the library. Giles is on the phone in his office.

Giles: Yes? Thank you, thank you.

He hangs up, puts the phone down, grabs his coat and quickly comes out

of the office.

Giles: I have a lead.

Willow and Xander look up from doing their homework at the table.

Giles: A friend in Oakland has a-a-a sketchy report of a . . . (grabs his

overcoat) young girl fending off a group of vampires . . . (grabs his bag)

about a week ago. (looks at his watch) There's a plane out in about an

hour.

Willow and Xander exchange a look.

Xander: And what makes this different from the last nine leads?

Giles: Well, I believe there's a meal on this flight.

Xander: Look, I don't mean to poop the party here, it's just, you get

your hopes all up, and then it's just a big fat raspberry, and I feel

bad.

Willow: But it's good that you're looking, though. You shouldn't give

up.

Xander: Oh, yeah. Definitely.

Giles: Yes, one must try. Well, I-I-I should go. (rushes out)

Willow: You don't think maybe he'll find her?

Xander: I think he'll find her when she wants to be found.

They go back to doing their homework.

Cut to a street in L.A. at night. Buffy slowly walks along to her

apartment. Behind her, Lily follows her.

Lily: Anne?

Buffy doesn't respond.

Lily: (louder) Anne?

Still no response from Buffy.

Lily: Buffy?

Buffy stops in her tracks. Lily catches up.

Lily: Don't be mad. I won't turn you in or nothing. I guess you don't

recognize me.

Buffy: (thinks for a moment) Lily?

Lily: I mean from before. I was calling myself Chantarelle then. I used

to . . . (sighs) Well, I was in this cult that worshipped vampires. So

lame, I know.

Buffy: Yeah . . . I, uh, I remember.

Lily: But . . . you kinda saved us. I never thanked you or anything.

Buffy: Did you tell anyone who I was?

Lily: Oh, no! Not-not even Rickie. I mean, I was so surprised to see

you here, waiting tables . . . But I wouldn't tell. I know how it is when

you gotta get lost.

They start to walk again.

Buffy: Do you, uh, do you live nearby?

Lily: Well, there's a couple of places. Uh, they're abandoned, and a

lot of people stay there. (pauses) So how come you came up with Anne?

Buffy: It's my middle name.

Lily: Lily's from a song. Rickie picked it. I'm always changing anyway.

Chantarelle was part of my exotic phase.

Buffy: It's nice. It's a . . .it's a mushroom.

Lily: It is? That's really embarrassing.

Buffy: Um, well, i-it's an exotic mushroom, if that's any comfort.

Lily: Well, before that, I was following this loser preacher and

calling myself "Sister Sunshine."

Buffy: What do they call you at home?

Lily looks away and doesn't respond.

Buffy: I like Lily.

Lily: It's cool for now. Hey, do you have any money?

They stop, and Buffy gives her a surprised look.

Lily: I didn't mean that like-- Well, I just mean . . . I know this guy,

he's gonna have this kinda rave thing in his basement. We could go. I

mean, I could show you if you had-- 'Cause I'm broke.

Buffy: I-I don't think so. I just kind of . . . I want to be alone.

Lily: I didn't mean to bug you.

Buffy: No! I-I didn't, I didn't mean that, it's just . . . Well, a-a lot

of people like that, it's, it's too much.

Lily crosses her arms and looks very disappointed. Buffy looks down and

starts to dig through her purse.

Buffy: I-I do have the money, though, so, why don't you and Rickie go,

and then maybe I could meet you some other time--

Lily raises her hands and waves off the offer.

Lily: No. It's okay, it's okay. Forget about it. Just--

A homeless man rudely pushes his way between them. The two girls both

stare after him.

Lily: That's not very polite.

The man turns around and looks blankly back at them.

Buffy: Are you okay?

Homeless man: I'm no one.

He turns back around and walks into the traffic on the street. Buffy's

eyes widen with concern. The man stops in the middle of a lane in front

of an oncoming pickup truck and faces it, arms stretched wide. Buffy

drops her bag and rushes into the street. The pickup driver honks his

horn and slams on the brakes. The truck starts to skid. Buffy pushes the

man out of the way in time to save him, but not in time to avoid getting

hit herself. She gets hit hard in the legs by the bumper. Her body snaps

down hard onto the hood of the truck and she slides into the windshield.

She bounces back and slides off of the hood as the truck screeches to a

halt. She hits the pavement, flips over backward and rolls to a stop in

the middle of the street.

*** Part 2 ***

The street. The driver quickly gets out of the pickup cab and runs over

to Buffy lying in the street, but Lily reaches her first. Buffy is on

her hands and knees trying to get up. People from all around come

rushing into the street.

Lily: Are you okay?

Driver: Jeez, I didn't see you.

He takes her by the arms and helps her up.

Lily: Oh . . . Maybe, maybe you shouldn't move.

Driver: Maybe you should lie down.

Buffy looks around nervously at all of the people gathering.

Buffy: No, I'm fine.

Driver: Somebody call an ambulance!

Buffy holds up her hands to fend of everyone's help.

Buffy: No! I'm okay, I just . . . I need to go.

She runs off, apparently not the least bit hurt.

Cut to further down the street. Buffy is walking at a brisk pace as she

goes around a corner. There she bumps into Ken and knocks all of his

leaflets onto the sidewalk.

Ken: Whoa! (sees his leaflets) Oh . . .

They both crouch down to pick up the papers.

Ken: Where are you running to?

Buffy: Sorry.

Ken: Maybe I should ask, where are you running from?

They've finished gathering up his leaflets and stand back up. Ken takes

a good look at Buffy.

Ken: You're pretty new around here. Uh, you've got the 'look', though.

Buffy: The 'look'?

Ken: Like you had to grow up way too fast. What's your name?

Buffy: Anne. (pushes past him to go)

Ken: Hey, um, I'm Ken. Here, go ahead, take one of these.

He holds out a leaflet, and Buffy looks at it. It reads "Come home to

Family Home", and has a drawing of a house and a silhouette of a man

reaching out to hug a child.

Ken: Don't be shy about stopping by. I mean, I guess you're not

starving, but . . . we're not just interested in feeding the body. You

might find something you're missing.

Buffy: (looks up at him) I'm alright.

Ken: (gives her a look of disbelief) Then why are you here? (Buffy

looks away) This is not a good place for a kid to be. You get old fast

here. (Buffy looks up at him knowingly) The thing that drains the life

out of them is despair. I mean, kids come here, and they got nothing to

go home to, and . . . this ends up being the last stop for a lot of them.

(Buffy looks down the street) Shouldn't have to be that way.

"Back to Freedom" by Bellylove starts playing as several shots of

homeless people are shown.

Lyrics: Ooo-ooo-ooo / On my way to freedom

A woman alone in the street, a boy and girl huddling together on the

curb, a young boy begging from a businessman who rejects him as he walks

by, a woman with a dirty face looking into the camera.

Lyrics: I ask myself

Cut to the Bronze. Bellylove is on stage performing their ballad.

Lyrics: Why did I come again? / To find my own way to freedom

The camera pans from above down to the singer, then over to the guitar

player.

Lyrics: And the change is gonna come / I'm gonna find my way / Find my

way / Find my way back to freedom

The camera pans around behind the singer, showing the people in the

club. It's not a busy night. Xander is lounging on a couch off to the

side. Willow is sitting in the loveseat set at a right angle to the

couch.

Lyrics: I'm gonna find my way / Find my way / Find my way / Find my way

back to freedom

The camera cuts closer to Xander and Willow.

Xander: Boy, I'm glad we showed up for "Depressing Night."

Willow: I wonder what she's doing right now.

Xander: Oh, I know what she's doing. Gabbing to all of her friends

about her passionate affair with Pedro the Cabana Boy, laughing about

me, thinking how she still might have feelings about me.

He glances over at Willow and sees her sadly raise her eyebrows at him.

Xander: Oh, it's possible you were talking about Buffy.

Willow: It's possible. The Bronze just never seems the same without

her.

Oz arrives, hands Xander a drink and sits down next to Willow.

Xander: Yeah, and the slaying isn't getting any easier, either.

Oz: I don't know. I think we're kinda getting a rhythm down.

Xander: We're losing half the vamps.

Oz: Yeah, but . . . rhythmically.

Willow: We just need to work on our timing, I think.

Xander: (looks up) No, I know what we need.

Oz: A Vampire Slayer?

Xander: Next best thing.

Willow follows his gaze and sees Cordelia coming into the Bronze with a

few friends.

Lyrics: Ooo-ooo / My own way to freedom

Xander: Bait.

Cut to the Summers house. Cut inside. Joyce is writing out a few bills.

She hears a knocking at the door, and looks up. She goes over to the

door and answers it. She is surprised at who she sees standing there.

Joyce: Uh, hello.

Giles: Hello. Um, may I . . . (gestures inside)

Joyce: Oh, uh, of course. (waves him in) Come on in.

Giles: Thank you. (slowly walks into the living room) I've, uh, just

come back from Oakland. A friend of mine called with a lead. Stories

about someone fighting vampires. (takes off his glasses) It, uh, didn't

pan out, I'm afraid. (starts to clean them)

Joyce: (sighs) No Buffy.

Giles: No vampires. Bunch of school kids in heavy mascara listening to

extremely silly music.

Joyce: Well, thank you for going. (steps into the living room and

crosses her arms) I can hardly, uh . . . (exhales and smiles weakly) I can

hardly leave the house. I'm just afraid she'll call and she'll need my

help.

Giles: (puts his glasses back on) Buffy is the most capable child I've

ever known. I mean, she may be confused, u-unhappy, but I, uh, honestly believe

she's in no danger.

Joyce: (lowers her arms) I just wish I could talk to her. The last

thing we did was fight. (fidgets with her hands)

Giles: Joyce, you mustn't blame yourself for her leaving.

Joyce: (nods) I don't. (takes a breath) I blame you. (exhales)

Giles is taken aback.

Joyce: You've been this huge influence on her, guiding her. You had

this whole relationship with her behind my back. I feel like you've

taken her away from me.

Giles is speechless for a moment while he considers his answer.

Giles: I didn't make Buffy who she is.

Joyce: And who exactly is she?

Giles just looks at her.

Cut to Helen's Kitchen. Buffy is filling the sugar dispensers at the

counter. Lily comes in and walks up to her.

Lily: Buff--um, Anne? Can I talk to you?

Buffy glances up at her, but doesn't stop her work.

Buffy: Look, this really isn't a good time. Can it wait?

Lily: Rickie's gone. I haven't seen him for more than a day. I--he's

never left for that long. I think something's . . . happened. Maybe

something's happened.

Buffy: Well, did you call the police?

Lily: (sighs) Rickie skipped out on his parole. Uh, they would just

cause more trouble.

Buffy: (exhales) I don't know, did you, did you ask around?

Lily: Can you help me?

Buffy: Uh, I-I can't. (walks away)

Lily: (follows) But . . . but that's who you are and stuff, right? I mean,

you help people, and, you know--

Buffy: I can't get into this. I'm sorry, Lily.

Lily: You, you know how to do stuff.

Buffy: I don't. (exhales) Not anymore.

Lily: But . . . (whining) I don't know what to do.

Cut to the blood bank. Lily and Buffy come in.

Lily: We gave blood lots of times 'cause you get a few bucks. And they

have cookies!

Buffy: You're a fan of the sugar rush?

Lily: (smiles) It's nice.

Nurse: Hi. You here to donate blood?

Buffy: Uh, we're looking for a friend.

Lily: Rickie T.? We come in sometimes.

Nurse: Rickie, sure. Uh, he's not here.

Buffy: Well, do you know if he's been in the last day or so?

Nurse: Well, let me check the sheet.

Man: (off camera) Ow!

Buffy looks squeamish as she looks over and sees him being stuck with a

needle.

Buffy: This'll probably go faster if we split up.

Lily: (nods in agreement) Can I come with you?

Buffy: Okay, where did I lose you on the whole "splitting up" thing?

Lily: (smiles) Oh. Sorry.

Buffy: I was thinking we could check out some of your hangouts and, um,

I guess, meet later at my place.

Lily: Okay.

Nurse: Sorry, guys. He hasn't been here.

Buffy: Thanks.

Nurse: I'll tell him you were looking.

Buffy: Great.

They leave the blood bank. The nurse loses her friendly demeanor as she

watches them go. She swallows and begins to look around nervously.

Cut to a street at night. Cut to an abandoned building. A homeless man

stirs from his sleep as he hears Buffy come in, but goes back to sleep

when he sees it's not the cops. Buffy makes her way through the

building, being careful not to step on anyone. Some of them watch her as

she goes by. She walks slowly along a dark hall and turns a corner. She

is startled by a man with his arms full walking the other way behind

her. She continues along and soon notices an old man lying on the floor,

dead. The same old man that Buffy earlier saved from the truck. Next

to his head is an empty bottle of drain cleaner, an apparent

suicide. Buffy kneels next to him and feels for a pulse. Nothing. She

puts his arm down and sees that there's a tattoo of half a heart on his

forearm with a banner across the heart and the name Lily tattooed on it.

Buffy looks at the old man, confused.

Buffy: Rickie?

*** Part 3 ***

Buffy's apartment. Lily is there waiting for her to return. She finds

Buffy's stuffed duck and picks it up to stroke it. Buffy opens the door,

comes in and closes it behind her. Lily puts the duck down and steps

closer to Buffy.

Lily: Did you find Rickie? I thought of--well, he likes to go to this

movie house, you can get in around the back--

Buffy: (interrupting) Lily . . . I think he's dead.

Lily: (very sad and lost) But . . . he takes care of me.

Buffy: I'm sorry.

Lily: We're gonna get a place. His cousin can get him a job at the car

wash.

Buffy: Lily, there's (exhales) there's something else. (sits on the

bed) The, the person that I found . . . was old. He-he looked about eighty.

Lily: Well, that's not Rickie!

Buffy: I'm sure it was. I, I don't know how, but . . . it was like

something drained the life out of him.

Lily: Do you mean like a vampire?

Buffy: No. A vampire couldn't accelerate the aging process. Maybe it

was something in his blood. (has a thought) When was the last time you

guys gave blood together?

Lily: I don't understand. Maybe it's not Rickie, okay?

Buffy: (stands up) Lily, this is something you're just gonna have to

deal with.

Lily: (flustered) But he didn't do anything wrong! Why would this

happen to him?

Buffy: That's *not* the point. (Lily calms a bit) These things happen

all the time. You can't just . . . close your eyes and hope that they're

gonna go away.

Lily: Is it 'cause of you?

Buffy: (confused) What?

Lily: You know about . . . monsters and stuff. You could have brought this

with you.

Buffy: (very annoyed) I didn't bring anything with me. And I didn't ask

for you to come to me with your problems. I just wanted to be left

alone. If you can't deal, then *don't* lay it off on me!

Lily can't take it. She holds up her hands to deny what she's hearing

and walks out of the apartment. Buffy sighs, regretting raising her

voice to Lily.

Cut to the street. Lily stops walking and leans against the iron gates

pulled across a storefront. Ken comes up behind her.

Ken: Are you okay?

Lily shakes her head, barely able to keep from crying.

Ken: Hey, it's okay. Maybe I can help.

Lily: (sniffles) You can't. (breathes deeply)

Ken: Look, I know you all think I'm a big square handing out leaflets

about hope. But hope is a real thing, just like despair. And hope can

fill up a part of you that's missing.

Lily: But Rickie . . .

Ken: Rickie? Say, are you Lily? (smiles) Right! Right, he was talking about

you.

Lily: (faces him) You've seen Rickie?

Ken: Oh, sure! Rickie's with us now.

Lily: She said he was dead.

Ken: Well, someone's sure handed you a tall tale. Rickie's no more dead

than I am. Why don't you come to Family Home? We'll get you taken care

of.

Lily considers for a moment. Ken smiles at her, and she nods in

agreement. He takes her by the arm and leads her away.

Cut to the blood bank. A shadow appears on the other side of the frosted

glass of the door. The camera pans down to the doorknob being jiggled.

Suddenly it gets ripped out of the door. Cut to a filing cabinet. Buffy

is looking through it to find Rickie's records. She grabs it and a few

others, closes the cabinet and takes the folders over to a desk. She

turns on a lamp and begins to go through them. First she pulls out

Rickie's and opens it. She scans his latest donation form. It looks

normal, except for the word "candidate" in the comments box.

Buffy: Candidate for what?

Behind her the nurse quietly walks in. Buffy opens another record and

sees "candidate" again.

Nurse: What are you doing?

Buffy: Breaking into your office and going through your private files.

(looks at another file) Candidate for what?

Nurse: I'm calling the police.

She steps toward Buffy to get to the phone. Buffy reaches over to the

phone and yanks it off of the wall. It falls to the desk with its wires

torn.

Buffy: Now, you've got a whole bunch of candidates here. I wonder if

any of them are missing like Rickie. (faces the nurse) Gosh, I bet they

are.

Nurse: You're getting yourself in a lot of trouble.

Buffy: I don't want any trouble. I just want to be alone and quiet in a

room with a chair and a fireplace and a tea cozy. I don't even know what

a tea cozy is, but I want one. Instead, I keep getting trouble, which I

am more than willing to share. (the nurse looks at her nervously) What

are you doing with these kids?

Nurse: Nothing. I just . . . I give him the names of the healthy ones.

Buffy: Give them to who?

Cut to Family Home. Ken looks at Lily, who is wearing only a simple long

tunic.

Ken: Well, don't you look nice?

Lily: I guess.

Ken: Well, you don't want to wear your own outfit to the cleansing.

It'll get soaked.

Lily: A cleansing is like a baptism? Right?

Ken: Not quite the same.

Indicates the way. She follows him.

Lily: Will I see Rickie after?

Ken: Oh, of course. He's waiting for you. He's very excited.

Cut to the Sunnydale cemetery. Xander, Cordelia, Willow and Oz walk

along a pathway. Oz is twirling a stake.

Cordelia: Why do I have to be bait? I'm always bait. Why can't Willow

be bait?

Xander: He's already seen Willow. And could you complain louder so that

all the vampires leave?

Oz: I think this is a good spot.

They all stop and look around.

Oz: Is everybody packin'?

Willow and Xander each pull out a stake. Willow also has a cross.

Oz: Let's do it.

Willow, Oz and Xander split up and look for places to hide, leaving

Cordelia alone out in the open. Cordelia is not liking this, and she

quickly makes tracks after Xander.

Cordelia: I'm doing this for Buffy's sake. This has nothing to do with

you.

Xander: Yeah, like I needed that cleared up. (finds a hiding place) Go

away. This is my hiding spot.

Cordelia: Where do I hide?

Xander: You don't hide. You're bait. Go act baity.

Cordelia: What's the plan?

Xander: The vampire attacks you.

Cordelia: And then what?

Xander: The vampire kills you. We watch, we rejoice.

Willow overhears from her hiding place and sighs.

Cordelia: Everything's a joke with you.

Xander: No, just our relationship.

Cordelia: What relationship?

Willow looks down at her stake, contemplating using it on them. Andrew

appears behind her and smiles evilly.

Xander: Oh, that's right, I forgot. We actually want to bury that piece

of the past, don't we?

Andrew begins to sneak up on Willow.

Cut to Family Home. The camera shows a small rectangular pool of what

looks like black tar, and pans up from it to Ken and Lily walking into

the room.

Ken: We come to this station to wash away the past. Go ahead, kneel.

He indicates the edge of the pool, and Lily kneels down. Ken squats next

to her.

Ken: We let the water run over the sin and the pain and the

uncertainty.

Lily: It looks kinda . . . dirty.

Ken: (smiles) Yeah.

Cut to the front door of Family Home. A man comes up to the door where

another man is already listening to Buffy talk.

Buffy: You know, I just . . . I woke up, and I looked in the mirror, and I

thought, "hey, what's with all the sin? I need to change. I'm . . . I'm

dirty. I'm, I'm bad with the . . . sex and the envy and that, that loud

music us kids listen to nowadays. W--" (sees that the guy isn't buying

it) Oh, I just suck at undercover. Where's Ken?

The man tries to slam the door closed, but she kicks it open and it

slams into his face instead. She marches in.

Cut to Ken and Lily. She reaches down to the black water in the pool.

For a moment she hesitates, but then puts her hand in. The liquid is

thick and pitch-black, and her hand disappears in it. Buffy swings open

the door, banging it loudly into the wall. Ken looks at her and stands

up.

Ken: This is a private moment. If you could just--

Buffy: How do you make 'em old, Ken? Do you feed on youth? What's the

deal?

Ken: Do you really wanna know?

Lily: (looks back) What's going on?

Buffy is surprised to see Lily there. Suddenly something grabs Lily. She

screams as she is pulled into the pool and disappears into the black

slime. Buffy runs to help, but Ken grabs her and chokes her with his arm

around her neck. Buffy grabs his arm and tries to snap her body back to

make him release her, but instead they just both fall into the pool as

well.

Cut to a dimly lit passageway. Buffy and Ken fall out of a black pool in

the ceiling. Buffy briefly looks up at the pool, then looks around to

see where she is. She sees Lily leaning against the wall holding her

head.

Buffy: Lily.

She rolls over onto her hands and knees and quickly crawls over to Lily.

Ken is faring worse, apparently hurt in the fall.

Lily: (in pain) Oh . . .

Buffy looks up at the pool in the ceiling. The waves from her fall

through it are beginning to dissipate.

Ken: Oh, my face!

Buffy looks over at Ken.

Ken: Ow! My face!

He turns toward them and begins to pull his face and his hair off.

Ken: Do you have any idea how hard it is to glue that thing on?!

Beneath his mask Ken's face is red and his head is bald. There appear to

be pieces of skin missing from his forehead, revealing the even redder

flesh beneath. Lily begins to panic. Buffy starts to get to her feet and

tries to pull Lily up with her. Ken stands up.

Ken: (yells) Guards!

Buffy takes Lily's hand and begins to run, pulling her along. Two guards

show up. Their faces are even more mangled and raw-looking than Ken's.

One of the guards hands Ken a club. They begin to pursue the girls.

Buffy and Lily run through a maze of halls and come out on a ledge that

overlooks what looks like a large iron works. There are huge vats of

molten metal, sparks are flying through the air from one side, and it is

hot and smoky. Buffy looks closer, and in the shadows sees people being

used as slave labor, kept in line by more guards with whips. The camera

pans through the place showing zombie-like humans pounding the metal on

anvils, pushing wheelbarrows from place to place and swinging

sledgehammers. Some of them cough hard as they work. The guards watch

and crack their whips every so often. Ken comes up behind Lily as she

takes in the scene.

Ken: Welcome to my world. I hope you like it.

Buffy and Lily look back at him. He hits Buffy hard in the face with his

club, knocking her out.

Ken: (to Lily) You're never leaving.

He smiles and licks his lips.

*** Part 4 ***

The Sunnydale cemetery. Cordelia and Xander are still arguing.

Xander: Let me just ask you one thing: how long did it take you to forget me? Were you

still taxiing down the runway, or was it actually in the cab?

Cordelia: Oh, yeah, Mr. Faithful? You probably met up with some hot

little Inca Mummy Girl. Yeah! I heard about her.

Xander raises his finger at her and is about to respond when they hear

Willow get tackled to the ground and scream.

Willow: Help!

Their attention is immediately diverted to Willow, and they begin to run

to her aid. Oz is quicker and beats them there. He jumps over Andrew and

grabs him on the way, using his momentum to pull Andrew off of Willow

and then throw him aside. Andrew and Willow both quickly get to their

feet. Oz holds up his stake, ready to attack Andrew. Willow runs away.

Oz lunges at Andrew, but he just diverts Oz to the side and sends him

rolling to the ground. Next Xander comes at Andrew, stake held ready,

but Andrew grabs his staking arm by the wrist with one hand and his

shoulder with the other, and they begin to struggle. Cordelia watches

them struggle, worried.

Cordelia: Xander!

She decides to join the fight, and attacks Andrew from behind, pushing

him and Xander down to the ground. They end up with Andrew sandwiched

between Xander on the bottom and Cordelia on the top. With Cordelia's

weight on top of him and Xander's leverage against the ground, Andrew

can't hold back the stake any longer, and it plunges into his chest. He

explodes into ashes between them, and Cordelia falls down on top of

Xander. The two of them look at each other for an instant, then grab

each other and start kissing passionately.

Cut to Ken's world. Buffy is lying on the floor in a cell. Lily is

sitting on the floor behind her leaning against a pillar. Buffy regains

consciousness, rolls onto her side and feels her head where Ken hit her.

No blood, but she is still a bit dazed.

Buffy: Oh. Unh . . . (slowly sits up) Lily?

Lily: I always knew I would come here . . . sooner or later. I knew I

belonged here.

Buffy: (looks around) Where?

Lily: Hell.

Buffy: (turns her head toward Lily) This isn't Hell.

Ken: (appears at the bars) Isn't it?

Buffy spins her head around to look at Ken, but quickly regrets moving

it so fast.

Buffy: (in pain) Unh . . . (rubs her forehead)

Ken: What is Hell but the total absence of hope? The substance, the

tactile proof of despair. You're right, Lily. This is where you've been

heading all your life. Just like Rickie.

Lily: Rickie?

Ken: He forgot you. Well, it took him a long time. He remembered your

name years after he'd forgotten his own. But, in the end--

Lily: Years? But--

Ken: Oh. Uh, interesting thing: time moves more quickly here than in

your reality. A hundred long years will pass here. On Earth, it's just a

day.

Buffy: So you just work us till we're too old and spit us back out.

Ken: That's the plan. See, Lily, you'll die of old age before anyone

wonders where you went. Not that anyone will, that's why we chose you.

Buffy: You didn't choose me.

Ken: No. But . . . I know you . . . *Anne*. So afraid. So pathetically

determined to run away from whatever it is you used to be. (Buffy looks

away) To disappear. Congratulations. (Buffy looks at him again) You got

your wish.

Cut to a personnel elevator. The huge steel door splits open, the upper

half rising, the lower half sinking. A group of young slaves including

Buffy and Lily is herded out. Buffy trips and falls to the floor. The

other slaves stop walking. A guard starts to explain things to the new

recruits as Buffy slowly gets back to her feet.

Guard: You work, and you live. That is all.

The guard has even less skin on his head than Ken. He's wearing a hood

that looks like it's made of human skin sewn together. His chin

and cheeks are exposed flesh and muscle, and he has no lips covering his

teeth. Buffy is standing again, holding her head in pain.

Guard: You do not complain or laugh or do anything besides work.

Whatever you thought, whatever you were, does not matter. You are no one

now. You mean nothing.

The guard walks to one end of the group and faces the boy standing

there. Behind them the elevator doors close with a slam.

Guard: Who are you?

Aaron: (afraid) Aaron.

The guard whales hard on him with his club, and the boy grunts in pain

and falls to the floor unconscious. Buffy immediately sobers, and stares

intensely ahead. The guard advances to Lily.

Guard: Who are you?

Lily: (whimpers) No one.

The guard continues to the next person.

Guard: Who are you?

Boy#2: (fearfully) No one.

The guard reaches Buffy.

Guard: Who are you?

She looks up at him for a moment, and then smiles.

Buffy: (friendly) I'm Buffy. The Vampire Slayer. And you are?

The guard is incensed at her insubordination, and roars as he wields

back his club to strike her. He swings at Buffy, but she sidesteps him

and grabs his arm as he bends over from his follow-through. Buffy slams

her other forearm down on the guard's, breaking it. He falls to the

floor in pain. She picks up his club and swings it at another guard,

striking him in the head. She swings again the opposite way at a third

guard, hitting him in the gut. They both fall unconscious. Buffy looks

over at the group of would-be slaves.

Buffy: Anyone who's not having fun here, follow me.

She starts to run, and the group follows her.

Cut to a shot of the main iron works from above. The vats of molten

metal glow brightly. There are sparks flying everywhere. Cut to the

slaves working below. The camera pans up to a ledge where two guards are

watching them work. Cut to a guard walking down a metal staircase. Buffy

and the small group are hiding beneath it.

Buffy: (looking up at the guards) There's no way we can get back up

there without meeting new people. (looks at Lily) Okay. Lily, when those

guards leave--and they will leave--I want you to take these people and

get them up there, okay? Fast and quiet.

Lily: You're leaving me? But--

Buffy: Lily . . . You can handle this. 'Cause I say so.

Suddenly a siren begins to wail loudly.

Buffy: We've gone public. Okay, quick, get them up. Go! Quiet!

Lily begins to lead them away, but comes back.

Lily: I'm sorry I said this was your fault before.

Buffy: Lily, this can wait.

Lily: Well, in case we die--

Buffy: Go! Go!

Lily runs off to lead the group out. Buffy sees two guards coming for

them and leads them away at a run. She winds around through the slaves

still blindly working away.

Guard: Get out of the way!

The guards are big and bulky compared to her small figure darting

through the maze, but they manage to keep up.

Guard: Come on, get out of the way!

She sees a pole jutting out of the floor and grabs onto it, swings around

once and knocks one of the guards out with an aerial side kick. She lets

go of the pole and begins to run again. She reaches a platform, shoulder

rolls onto it and rises to a standing position. Her pursuer jumps up

onto the stage and tries a backhand swing at her with his sledgehammer,

but she ducks and blocks his second swing. The guard kicks up with his

knee and gets Buffy in the stomach, stunning her. He punches her, making

her fall to the floor. He takes a swing at Buffy's head, but she clamps

her hands around the hammer's handle and yanks him up and over her. He

slams down hard onto his shoulder and rolls off of the platform. Buffy

still has his hammer and quickly gets to her feet. The two other guards

on the ledge leave their post and begin to approach her.

Cut to Lily leading the group to a set of stairs. She ushers them up.

Lily: C'mon, c'mon, everybody go! Go!

One after the other they quickly climb the stairs. Lily brings up the

rear.

On the platform Buffy continues to fight another guard. She quickly hits

him in the head with a full spinning out-to-in crescent kick. He takes

the blow hard and falls off of the platform. Still another guard takes a

swing at Buffy's legs with his sledgehammer, but she jumps high to avoid

the swing. Buffy swings her hammer into the guard's face, knocking him

down. As he tries to get up, Buffy knocks him down again with a snapping

roundhouse kick to his arm, kicking his hammer away in the process. The

guard gets to his feet. Buffy swings her hammer in an uppercut, striking

him in the jaw and sending him flying off of the platform in a backflip.

Yet another guard jumps up onto the platform and tackles Buffy,

struggling to get the hammer out of her hands.

Cut to a ledge. Ken and two more guards come out to see what's going on.

Ken can't believe what he is seeing.

Cut below. Buffy does a roundhouse kick to the guard's face, and he

stumbles backwards. Another guard comes up to the edge of the platform

holding a battle-ax with a curved blade. He looks at the fighting for a

moment, then moves to jump up onto the platform.

Cut to Ken on the ledge.

Ken: Humans don't fight back.

Cut below. The guard on the platform tries to pound Buffy's head with

his club, but she holds her hammer high, blocking his attack and making

him drop his weapon.

Ken: (enraged) Humans don't fight back!

Buffy swings down with her hands, carrying the guard's hands as well.

She grabs him by the neck, spins around once and throws him through the

air. He hits a steel beam and slumps to the ground. The guard with the

battle-ax is up on the platform now and takes a wide swing with it at

Buffy, but she leans aside and he misses.

Ken: That's how this works!

Buffy manages to duck the guard's next swing, avoiding decapitation. He

swings again from above, but she blocks his attack with her hammer, and

the head of the ax embeds itself in the handle. Buffy performs a front

snap kick that dislodges the ax and knocks the weapon out of the guard's

hands and spinning up into the air. She kneels down and knocks his legs

out from under him with her hammer. While she's crouched, she looks up

at the battle-ax as it falls and catches the airborne weapon. She gets

to her feet, as does her assailant. Buffy does another roundhouse kick

to his face, and he goes flying off of the platform.

Ken: (to the guards with him) Get down there!

The two guards run to obey. On the platform the camera pans in close to

Buffy as she looks around, temporarily without an opponent. Suddenly a

guard jumps up. Buffy swings a backhand punch at his head, but he blocks

it and shoves her arm out of the way. He punches her with a backhand

fist. She stumbles a little but recovers in time to duck his second

swing at her head. She does a side kick to his rear that sends him off

of the platform. Two more guards try to climb onto the platform. Buffy

crouches and quickly throws her battle-ax spinning end over end at one

of them. It slices deeply into his chest, and the power behind her throw

sends him falling off of the platform. The other guard tries a wide

swing, but Buffy blocks it, grabs onto his arm and sends him

somersaulting through the air and off of the platform. Another guard

attacks. Buffy smashes her elbow into his nose and follows it up with a

full spin and a backhand punch to the head. He falls down awkwardly.

Another one leaps up and catches Buffy unaware with a high punch to her

face. She stumbles backwards but doesn't fall. Two more guards join him

and try to surround her. Buffy snap kicks one in the face and side kicks

another. Buffy does a full spinning hook kick to the third, smacking him

soundly in the skull.

Cut to the ledge. Ken is disgusted with what he sees and goes back

through the door.

Cut below. One of the guards punches Buffy hard in the face, and she

staggers. He grabs her by the neck while she's trying to regain her

balance and yanks her head up fast and hard. He holds her while two

other guards punch her in the stomach.

Cut to a dimly lit corridor. The group of slaves runs down it, trailed

by Lily. They round a corner. As Lily is about to follow them, Ken grabs

her from behind, pulls out a large knife and holds it to her neck. She

doesn't struggle as he leads her off back to the ledge.

Cut to the platform. The guards keep on punching Buffy. Finally she is

able to retaliate and swings an arm out, backhand punching two of them

and high punching the third, knocking him down. She swings her arm out

in a wide arc and hits the first two with the one blow, knocking them

down as well. A fourth guard roundhouse kicks her in the stomach, and

she steps back to regain her balance. He latches onto her arm and tries

to throw her, but Buffy reverses the move and manages to throw him off

of the platform instead. A guard dives headfirst for Buffy's legs. She

leaps up and pulls her legs up into a tuck jump over him. He dives right

underneath her. Buffy runs and jumps off of the platform, grabbing a

pole. It bends under her weight, and she rides it down to the floor

below. She begins to run, and the chase is on again. She doesn't get

very far when she looks up and sees Ken coming back out onto the ledge

holding his knife to Lily's neck. Buffy stops in her tracks. The guards

chasing her quickly catch up and grab her by the arms.

Ken: One of you fights . . . and you all die!

He lets go of Lily and pushes her aside. He stares intently down at

Buffy.

Ken: That . . . was not . . . permitted.

Buffy: Yeah, but it was fun.

Ken: (smiles) You've got guts. I think I'd like to slice you open and

play with them.

He holds up his knife and addresses everyone in the area.

Ken: Let everyone know!

Lily cowers behind him. Ken seems to have forgotten that she's there.

Ken: *This* is the price of rebellio--

Lily pushes him from behind, and he falls screaming from the high ledge

to the floor below. The guards holding Buffy just watch as he hits

bottom with a loud thud. Buffy gives Lily a surprised look, and then

quickly takes advantage of the distraction and backhand punches her

captors, one in the face and the other in the groin. While the second

one is dazed, she shoves her weight against him, and he falls backward

onto a barrel. The first one punches high, but she blocks, grabs his arm

and flips him over onto a pile of burlap sacks. Buffy jumps up onto the

pile and steps across her fallen attacker. He tries to grab her, but

misses. She jumps high into the air and grabs hold of a heavy chain

hanging from above. She climbs it hand-over-hand as quickly as she can

to the ledge where Lily is still standing. The two of them run through

the door and quickly find their way to the others, struggling with a

heavy iron gate.

Lily: They'll be coming.

Buffy crouches down and takes hold of the gate, bracing herself for a

very heavy lift. She begins to raise the gate, straining as she goes.

Buffy: (grunts) Okay . . . this . . . works . . . the abs . . . and . . . the glutes.

(grunts)

As soon as she gets it high enough, Lily waves to the others to crawl

underneath. They all scramble to the other side.

Buffy: I'm gonna feel this for a week!

She holds the gate up over her head and squeezes her head and shoulders

between two of the bars to get to the other side. Suddenly Ken appears

behind her, bloodied from his fall, and tackles her to the floor. His

club goes flying. The gate falls down behind him. He suddenly arches up

and screams in pain. Buffy rolls to a stop out of his reach. She gets to

her hands and knees and looks over at him as he continues to scream in

pain. The camera pans from his bloody face over his back and to his

legs, where two of the gate's bars have impaled themselves through his

calves. The slaves help each other up through the black slime of the

pool in the ceiling. Buffy gets to her feet and picks up Ken's club. She

approaches him, and he arches his back to look up at her.

Ken: You've *ruined* . . . You . . .

Buffy: Hey, Ken, wanna see my impression of Gandhi?

She wields back the club and brings it down hard onto his head, crushing

his skull. Lily comes up behind her and looks at him squeamishly.

Lily: Gandhi?

Buffy: Well, you know, if he was really pissed off.

Cut to the pool room at Family Home. The homeless people walk out of the

room. Lily is kneeling by the pool helping Buffy out. She yanks her legs

from the slime and rolls onto the floor. They both get up and look at

the pool.

Lily: (points) What do we do about--

With a flash of light, the pool mysteriously tiles itself over to match

the tiles along the edges. It now appears to be a six-inch (15 cm) deep,

empty ceremonial pool. The two girls just stare at it in wonder.

Cut to Buffy's apartment. Buffy has finished cleaning herself up in the

kitchen. Lily is looking at the folding doors that separate the kitchen

from the rest of the apartment.

Buffy: Let me give you the tour.

She walks into the main room and slowly turns to face Lily.

Buffy: This concludes our tour.

Lily leans against the wall.

Lily: It's really nice.

Buffy leans against the dresser.

Buffy: All the rent's paid up for the next three weeks.

She turns around and opens one of the dresser drawers.

Buffy: I spoke to Mitch at the diner. (pulls out her uniform) He said

you can start on Thursday. (steps over to the bed) He's, uh . . . (lays

down the uniform) he's kind of . . . repulsive, but, uh, he won't give you

a hard time.

Lily sits down on the bed and puts her hand on the uniform.

Buffy: Um . . . I'll call and check up on you.

Lily: I'm not . . . great (looks at Buffy) at taking care of myself.

Buffy: Gets easier. Takes practice.

She looks down sadly. Lily knows the feeling. She looks back down at the

uniform and the nametag pinned to it.

Lily: Hey . . .

Buffy looks up at her.

Lily: Can I be 'Anne'?

She smiles at Buffy. Buffy smiles back.

Cut to the kitchen at the Summers house. Joyce is trying to get a stuck

utensil out of the dishwasher. There's a knock at the door, and Joyce

looks up startled. She frowns at the fork she pulled out and puts it

down. She gets up, grabs a towel and heads for the front door, wiping

her hands. In the dining room she pauses and looks toward the door,

suddenly wondering who might be there. She drapes the towel over a chair

and slowly goes to the door. When she opens it, there stands Buffy,

looking sad, tired and disheveled. For a long moment they just look at

each other without saying a word. Then they step toward each other and

hold each other close for a long, tight embrace.
