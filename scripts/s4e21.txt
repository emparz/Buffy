Fade into an exterior shot of the College.

Cut to the crypt.

Buffy is walking around.

Buffy: Riley?

She turns around and walks over to somewhere else.

Buffy: Riley?

Cut to Riley and Adam.

Adam: Your thoughts are troubled. In turmoil. I understand, brother. We have a lot to discuss. Speak.

Riley: What have you done to me?

Adam: Nothing. It was mother, Your...Professor Walsh. She implanted

the behavior modifier.

Riley: A chip in my head. She really did it.

Adam: Actually, the chip is here. (points to his chest) Tied directly

into your central nervous system through your thoracic nerve. This is

Phase One of your preparation. It lay dormant until the time came. I

simply activated it, brother.

Riley: Stop calling me that. I'm not your brother. You're a botched

science experiment. I'm a human being, who's gonna do everything in

his power to--

Adam: Sit.

Riley sits down.

Adam: You have no power. Not yet. Once you forget your old life and

embrace your destiny as I have, you will know power you've never

dreamed of. I think you're going to like it.

*** Opening Credits ***

Fade into the crypt.

Adam is walking around.

Adam: Humans claim to old ways and ancient feuds. And they're

hopeless with technology. Unworthy. (turns around)

Riley: Not really wanting a lecture right now.

Adam continues walking.

Adam: Disappointed by demon-kind, we turned to humans. Smart,

adaptive, (turns around) but emotional and weak. Blind. There's

imperfection everywhere. Something must be done. Who will deliver

us?

Riley says nothing.

Adam: Mother. She saw our future. Yours and mine. She saw that you

were necessary. She saw the role you will play by my side. Stand up.

Riley stands up.

Adam: You see, we are brothers after all.

Cut to Spike in the crypt.

Spike: It warms the cockles of my non-beating heart seeing you lads

together.

Adam: I didn't send for you, Spike.

Spike: Yeah, well...I'm not much the being-sent-for type.

Spike starts walking forward.

Spike: I'm much more the "I did my part, now get this chip out of my

head" kind of guy.

Spike looks at Riley.

Spike: Slightly stiffer than usual.

Spike snaps his fingers in Riley's face, who doesn't move a muscle.

Spike: Subtle, but I like it.

Spike starts nudging Riley.

Spike: What's with him?

Adam: I activated his chip.

Spike: Oh, so, it's chips all around, is it? Someone must've bought

the party-pack.

Adam: You get yours removed when the Slayer is where I want her.

Spike: She's separated from her friends.

Spike walks over to a chair.

Spike: They want nothing to do with her.

Spike sits down.

Spike: She's all alone.

Adam walks over to Spike.

Adam: That's how I want her. Where I want her is down in the

Initiative. (stops walking) She will ensure that as many demons die

as humans, she will achieve maximum carnage before she's too weak to

go on.

Riley: No. You can't...

Adam: Stop talking.

Riley stops.

Adam looks at Spike.

Spike: Right. The Initiative. But getting her there--that's what the

bleeding disks are for, isn't it? Our little witch gives her the info

and pop--Alice heads back down the rabbit hole.

Adam: The witch.

Spike: Uh, Willow. (uses his hands to demonstrate height) About so

high, perky, good with math. Natural choice.

Adam: A friend.

Spike: Right.

Adam: One of the friends from whom you so efficiently separated her.

Spike: Damn right I did. You should've seen her. They won't be

talking to each other for a long, long...

Adam looks down at Spike.

Spike: Hang on. I think I might've detected a small flaw.

Adam: So you failed.

Spike: Well, hey, you're supposed to be so smart. (stands up) You

let me plan this thing. Okay, let's not quibble about who failed who. The important thing is make sure the Slayer is where we want...

Adam: Go.

Spike: Gone.

Spike starts to leave. Halfway out, he stops and turns to Adam.

Spike: So, uh, we'll do this chip thing when I get back.

Adam just looks at him.

Spike nods his head in agreement and leaves.

Cut to an exterior view of Giles' apartment.

There is a knock at the door.

Cut to the interior.

Giles: Oh...

Giles walks over to the door and opens it.

Tara and Willow are on the other side.

Willow: Hey.

Giles: Hello. (looks down at his clothes) Um, oh, uh, pardon the

robe. It's a bit of a late start.

Willow: Right.

Tara: I hope you're feeling all right, Mr. Giles.

Giles: Oh, yes, quite well, thank you. I'll--I'll probably have a

brisk jog later on. Did you want something?

Willow: I forgot my laptop and the disks.

Giles: (takes off his glasses) Uh, yes, please, please come in.

Willow walks inside.

Giles: Will you be working here? Uh, typing...talking? Because, um,

that will be fine.

Willow: (smiling) No, that's okay.

Willow takes her laptop and puts it in her bag.

Giles looks at Tara, who smiles and nods.

Willow comes back over to the two.

Willow: Got 'em. So...see ya.

Giles: Right. Yes, well, good luck with--with all that.

Willow: Ok. Bye.

Tara: Bye.

Giles: Bye.

He closes the door.

Cut to Buffy and Willow's dorm room.

Buffy gets up from the floor and walks over to look at a picture of

her, Willow, and Xander. She puts the picture down and picks up the phone. After a beat, she puts the phone down. She walks over to a bag, and takes an axe.

Cut to an exterior view of Xander's house.

Cut to the interior view of Xander's basement.

Xander is lying in bed.

A door closes.

Anya: (o.s) Xander?

She comes down the stairs.

Anya: You said you wanted to check the board at the unemployment

office this morning.

She lifts the covers.

Anya: You can't go like that. They won't even interview you if you're

naked.

Xander: I'm not going. There's never anything good.

Anya sighs.

Xander: Maybe I should join the Army.

Anya: Don't they make you get up really early in the morning?

Xander: Oh, yeah.

Xander pulls the covers over him.

Xander: Never mind.

Anya pulls the covers away from his face.

Anya: Are you still upset about that fight you had with your friends? It was hours ago! Get over it.

Xander: Anya, you--Forget it.

Anya: So, they all think you're lost, directionless loser with no

plans for his future? Pfft.

Xander: Anya, you can't "pfft" that stuff away.

Anya: Why not?

Xander: I don't know. 'Cause I think maybe they're right.

Anya sighs and kneels down to Xander's bed and lies on his chest.

Anya: So what if they are? You're a good person, and a good

boyfriend, and... and I'm in love with you. Whatever they think of

you, it shouldn't matter.

Xander: Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't matter.

Cut to a crypt.

Buffy is walking around inside with an axe. She walks through to another part of the crypt.

Cut to the other part of the crypt. She looks around and sees many computers.

Buffy: (o.s) Adam...where are you?

Cut to the inside of a lab.

A ball moves away to reveal a laboratory.

Adam: This is where it all happens. Where the new race begins.

Riley: Where are we?

Adam: In the Initiative. There are areas no one knew about beyond

those that needed to. Mother kept her secrets well.

Pan over to a zombie-type woman.

Adam: Didn't you?

Riley (o.s) Professor Walsh?

Adam: This is all how she planned it, except she thought she would be

alive.

Professor Walsh walks over to a table with another doctor, who turns

around. It's Doctor Engleman.

Riley: Are you--

Adam looks at Riley.

Riley: Is that what you were gonna do to me?

Adam: They're just workers. You know your destiny is much greater. A zombie-man sits up.

Riley: Forrest? Oh, God.

Forrest: God has nothing to do with it.

Cut to Adam.

Cut to Riley.

Cut to black.

*** Commercial Break ***

Fade in to Adam's lair.

Buffy walks around and runs into Spike, who puts his hands up.

Spike: Easy, Sheriff. Watch where you point that thing.

Buffy: What are you doing here?

Spike: Looking for a little weekend getaway place. Shove off.

Spike starts walking past Buffy.

Buffy: Adam's been using these caves.

Spike stops walking.

Spike: What?

Buffy: I found his lair.

Spike: (sigh) Oh, cripes. That's all I need. Runnin' into that goon.

Buffy: Yeah, well, Adam's cleared out of here. Whatever he's planning

is about to go down.

Spike: Look at little Nancy Drew. What about those disks I nabbed? They ought to tell you something.

Buffy: Willow has the disks.

Spike: Well, then I'd get on that.

Cut to Buffy.

Spike: (o.s) Can't ignore valuable information

Cut to Spike.

Spike: Just 'cause you two birds fell out, now can you?

Buffy: Right.

Spike: Well, you do what you want.

He starts to leave.

Spike: No worry of mine, now is it?

Cut to Willow's room.

Willow and Tara are working on deciphering the disks.

Tara: Maybe you should rest. Clear your head?

Willow sits down.

Willow: Can't.
Cut to the screen.
Willow: Not now. I--I think I'm on to something. I've been assuming the--the ciphertext

was encrypted with an asymmetric algorithm. Then it hit me. A hexogonic key pattern. It's...

Tara: Hey, look, you did it.

Zoom into the screen.

After a beat, cut back to the two.

Willow: I didn't. I haven't even finished typing in the new code.

Tara: Something's doing it.

Willow: Must be programmed to self-decrypt to a

certain point. That is so annoying. It's like

someone blurting out the answer to a riddle just when you've--I mean Yippee! We have the information.

Tara: I'm not sure if "Yippee" is the right response, either. Read

that.

The phone rings. Tara gets up to answer it.

Tara: Hello? Yeah, she's right--I mean, let me check.

She moves the phone to her shoulder.

Tara: It's Buffy.

Cut to a close up of Willow's face.

Cut to the lower level of the Initiative.

Riley: Professor Walsh. Professor Walsh, it's Riley Finn. Can you

hear me?

Forrest: (o.s) She's dead. Artificially (walks into view) reanimated

with basic to moderate brain activity. Mommy can hear you, but she's

still a walking corpse.

Professor Walsh pulls out a syringe.

Riley: So are you.

Forrest: No. Got that wrong. I'm surging with life... and

strength. Adam made me to be nearly as bad as he is. Really looking

forward to trying out your girl again.

Riley: I'm sorry, Forrest.

Forrest: Don't be. This is the best thing that ever happened to me. I'm free of all my weaknesses...my doubts. He's gonna fix you up too,

soon as we got some choice parts. Then you and me will be back on the

same side again. Moving toward a new future.

Riley: I'll never let that happen.

Forrest: You don't get it brother, you don't have a choice. Your will

belongs to us now.

Riley: No. That's not true.

Forrest: Then why don't you get out of that chair and walk out of

here?

Riley: You can't control my...

Walsh: Riley, be a good boy.

She comes toward him with a syringe and puts it into his skin.

Cut to the campus.

Many people are walking around.

Buffy walks up, meeting with the Scooby Gang.

Buffy: (to Xander) Where's Anya?

Xander: Oddly, Anya decided not to join us, despite all the fun we had

at our last meeting.

Willow: And I don't think Tara felt welcome.

Buffy: Why? Because of the things that we said?

Willow nods.

Buffy: Will, who told you we were talking behind your back,

specifically?

Willow: Well, um...Spike, specifically, but...

Buffy: And who told you that we thought you'd be better off joining the Army?

Xander: That's not...exactly what he said.

Giles: Well, uh...S--S--Spike can be very convincing when--when--when,

uh...I'm very stupid.

Buffy: He played us. He wanted us to fight to split us up. That's

where it came from. The stuff we said the other night.

Giles: Of course. Well, piffle, let's move on.

Xander: I'm movin'.

Willow: Me, too.

Buffy: Good. Great.

Cut to Willow.

Cut to Xander.

Cut to Giles.

Cut to a shot of all four.

Willow: So...why do you think Spike made with the head games?

Xander: He's all dressed up with no one to bite. He's gotta get his

ya-yas somehow.

Buffy: I think it was more than that. I think it was Adam.

Xander: Spike's working for Adam?! After all we've done--nah, I can't

even act surprised.

Giles smiles.

Buffy: I just went to Adam's lair and he was gone. But, Spike just

happened to be there. He made this big noise about getting

information off those encrypted disks.

Willow: Oh, I decrypted them.

Buffy looks at her, surprised.

Willow: Well, they decrypted themselves, but I almost had it.

Giles: What did they say?

Willow: A bunch of stuff we already know about 314. But it also said

there's some final phase where Adam manufactures a bunch of creepy

cyber-demonoids like him. There's a special lab in The Initiative,

but it didn't say where.

Buffy: Adam fed Spike those disks. It has to be. He wanted me to

know about his evil-guy assembly line. This lab, it's in the

Initiative?

Willow: Hidden somewhere.

Buffy: We'll give the demon his due. He thought this one out.

Willow: What do you mean?

Buffy: You know how overcrowded the containment cells have been at the

Initiative?

Willow nods.

Buffy: Those demons were just too easy to catch. It's like they

wanted in that place.

Giles: (putting on his glasses) The Trojan horse.

Buffy: Adam's gonna make sure the demons attack the Initiative from

the inside.

Xander: Demons versus soldiers. Massacre, massacre.

Willow: And Adam has a neat pile of body parts to start assembling his

army. Diabolical, yet...(makes a face) Gross.

Xander: Does anybody else miss the Mayor, I just wanna be a big snake?

Buffy: I've got to shut him down, Giles. His final phase is about to

start.

Giles: We need to warn the Initiative.

Buffy: They're not gonna listen to me.

Willow: Riley?

Buffy: He's a deserter. He got some bad news anyway, and kinda took

off.

Xander: Okay, I'm confused again. Adam has this evil plan. Why is he

so anxious for you to know about it?

Buffy: He wants me there. Probably figures I'll even the kill ratio.

Xander: He's not worried you might kill, oh say, him?

Buffy: No, he's really not.

Cut to the lower lab.

Adam: She's coming. I can feel it.

Spike: Good on you. Got a chunk of prognosticating demon in there,

right?

He walks over to a chair.

Spike: Now, (claps his hands) if you'll just get this chip out of my

cranium...(sits down) I'll be out of your way. And mind the

hairline. I don't fancy fussing over a comb-over as I resume my

killing ways. Come on, we had a deal.

Adam: When she's here.

Spike sighs.

Cut to Riley.

Cut to Giles' apartment.

Giles: Certainly no lack of supplies. I only wish I knew which ones

would kill Adam.

Buffy: According to Riley, his power source is uranium core embedded

somewhere inside his chest. Probably near the spine.

Xander: Great, so we just ask him to lie down quietly while we do some

exploratory surgery.

Willow: What about magic? Some kind of, I don't know...uranium

extracting spell?

Everyone looks at her in disbelief.

Willow: I know. I'm reaching.

Giles stands up.

Giles: Perhaps a paralyzing spell.

He walks over to the bookshelf and pulls a book off.

Giles: Only I can't perform the incantation for this.

Willow: Right. Don't you have to speak it in Sumerian or something?

Giles: I do speak Sumerian. It's not that. Only a...an experienced

witch can incant it, and you'd have to be within striking distance of

this object.

Xander: See what you get for takin' French instead of Sumerian?

Buffy: What was I thinking?

Xander: So no problem, all we need is to combine Buffy--her with Slayer

strength, Giles' multilingual know how, and Willow's witchy power.

Giles looks at him.

Xander: Yeah, don't tell me. I'm just full of helpful suggestions.

Giles: As a matter of fact, you are.

Cut to an exterior shot of Lowell House.

Cut to the inside.

The gang walks through the door.

Willow: Nervous?

Xander: No way. I'm full of that good old kamikaze spirit.

Giles: Xander, just because this is never gonna work, there's no need

to be negative.

Willow: The adjoining spell, is it powerful enough to defeat Adam?

Giles: It's very powerful. It's also extraordinarily dangerous.

Buffy: Game faces, guys. We're going in.

She kicks in the window.

Dissolve to another area of the Initiative.

Fade in to Buffy and Willow climbing.

Buffy: How you doing?

Willow: Super. What was I thinkin', using stairs all this time?

Buffy: Okay. Will--

Willow: No, really, Buffy. It's not as scary as I thought.

Buffy: No. It's not what I was gonna say. I just...I'm sorry. I hate

that things have been so strained between all of us.

Willow: It's not your fault. Spike stirred up trouble.

Buffy: Yeah, but I think trouble was stir-uppable. I think we've all

sort of drifted apart this year, don't you?

Willow: Maybe a little. But, you know, first year of college, it's

hard to keep the old high school gang together.

Buffy: But I want it together. Will, I miss you. And Giles, and

Xander. And it is my fault. I've been wrapped up in my own stuff,

I've been a bad friend.

Willow: You're the Slayer, Buffy. Your stuff is pretty crucial.

Buffy: I mean Riley. And...Riley, mostly.

Willow: Well, I haven't been Miss Available either. I--I kept

secrets. I hid things from everyone.

Buffy: That's not your fault. Will, you were going through something

huge.

Willow: I wanted to tell you, but I was so scared.

Buffy: You can tell me anything. I love you. You're my best friend.

They hug.

Willow: Me, too. I love you too.

They begin falling due to the weight.

Willow: (o.s) Oh, falling now!

They land on the ground, but continue to hug.

Buffy: Let's promise to never not talk again.

Willow: I promise, I promise.

Xander slides down.

Buffy and Willow hug him.

Buffy: Xander.

Willow: Oh, wonderful Xander!

Buffy: You know we love you, right?

Willow: We totally do.

Xander: Oh God, we're gonna die, aren't we?

Willow: No, we just missed you.

Xander looks up.

Xander: Giles, hurry up!

Giles looks down.

Xander: You definitely wanna get down here for this!

Cut to Buffy and the gang.

Giles is inching the door open with a crowbar.

Buffy: Okay, we stick together, then everything should be fine. Everybody ready?

Giles gets the door open.

Buffy: Let's...

They open the door to reveal 5 Commando guys with laser blasters.

Buffy: ...do this.

Cut to black.

*** Commercial Break ***

Fade into an area in the Initiative.

Adam and Spike are watching the cameras.

Spike: Must-See-TV. Bait's been taken. Trap's all set. The Slayer

has landed. So...

Spike turns and looks at Adam.

Spike: Hello? Paging Dr. Owe Me One.

Adam: She's not alone.

Spike looks closer at the TV.

Adam: (o.s) You've failed me again.

Spike: Well, that's one way of looking at it.

Adam: What's the other way.

Spike bolts for the door, but Forrest grabs his neck.

Spike: Oh, come on! It's not like I wasn't trying! That's worth

something, isn't it?

Adam: I suppose. Yes. I will honor our agreement to remove your

chip.

Cut to Forrest and Spike.

Cut to Adam.

Adam: Take his head off.

Forrest grabs Spike and pins him down in a chair.

Colonel: Shut up. You've got some nerve, lady. (unzips the bag) You

think you and your friends can just keep waltzing into a government

installation brandishing weapons like...

He holds up the device.

Colonel: Like...

Willow: It's a gourd.

Giles: Magic gourd.

Colonel: What kind of freaks are you people? (puts the gourd down)

Buffy: Adam is here, Colonel. In the Initiative.

Colonel: Nice try.

Buffy: Those overcrowded containment cells of yours -- courtesy of Adam. He's pulling a Trojan Horse on you, he's just waiting...

Colonel: Everything in this installation is under 24-hour

surveillance.

Willow: Including the secret lab?

Colonel: Including everything! (takes a beat) What secret lab?

Buffy: The one Adam's been using. The one built for the final stage

of the 314 project.

The Colonel has a blank look on his face.

Buffy: And you have no idea what I'm talking about.

Colonel: I know everything that goes on around here. A tick on a

mouse couldn't get in without my knowing it. And if Adam wants to try

we're ready for him.

Giles: Jolly good. How--How exactly do you plan to get close enough

to Adam to remove his power source?

Colonel: Hit him simultaneously with multiple taser blasters. Incapacitate him with as much voltage as we can muster.

Xander: Great plan. That's right up there with "duck and cover".

Buffy: I've seen Adam hit with taser blasts. He feeds on it. And now

you're gonna provide him with an all-you-can-eat buffet?

Colonel: You telling me my business?

Buffy: This... is not your business. It's mine. You, the Initiative,

the boys at the Pentagon--you're all in way over your heads. Messing

with primeval forces you have absolutely no comprehension of.

Colonel: And you do?

Buffy: I'm the Slayer. You're playing on my turf.

Colonel: Up there, maybe. But down here, I'm the one who's in

control.

Buffy: (o.s) It's Adam.

Buffy: Look, I'm the only one who can stop him now. Just let me

handle this. Get your people out of here.

Colonel: All right, you men follow me. We gotta take the Armory now.

Soldier #3: Sir.

Colonel: These people are under arrest, do you understand?

Buffy: Once I'm in, barricade the door behind me. Is this place okay

to be Magic Central?

Giles: It, uh, should do.

Willow: As long as we don't get blowed up or nothin'.

Xander: What're the odds of that?

Buffy: How long before the ritual kicks in?

Giles: Five minutes, give or take.

Xander: Buffy, I still don't like you going in alone.
