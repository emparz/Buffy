*** Prologue ***

Underwater. Copious amounts of bubbles rise through it, some larger,

some smaller, as though someone below is doing their best to hold their

breath, but can't continue for much longer. The camera pans down, and

there is Buffy frantically trying to get to the surface. Below her Allan

grabs her ankle and pulls her down. She kicks her legs and flails her

arms, desperately trying to shake loose. Eventually she manages to break

free of his grip and swim to the surface. She breaks through and draws a

deep breath. There, kneeling on the dock above, she sees Faith, who

reaches down and shoves her back underwater.

Cut to Buffy's room. She wakes with a start from the nightmare, and

draws several deep breaths to calm herself as she realizes it was all

just a dream. She sits up in bed and looks around her room. She pushes

the blankets back, gets up and walks out into the hall, where she can

hear the news on the TV in her mother's room.

News Anchor: We go now live to our field reporter, who is standing by

at the waterfront with this breaking news about the murder that has

shocked the Mayor and residents of Sunnydale.

Buffy can see the TV from the hall. It is showing footage of the boat

retrieving Allan's body.

Field Reporter: Fishermen discovered the body today, the victim of a

brutal stabbing. Authorities and citizens alike were shocked when the

slain man was identified as Deputy Mayor Allan Finch.

Buffy can't believe that they not only found the body, but that he was

also a public figure.

Field Reporter: Still reeling from the news, Mayor Wilkins had this to

say.

The news cuts to the Mayor at a press conference.

Mayor Wilkins: Mr. Finch was not only my longtime aide and associate,

he was a close personal friend. I promise you I will not rest until

whoever did this is found and brought to justice. Thank you very much.

Joyce notices Buffy standing behind her.

Joyce: Oh, honey, you're up. (turns back to the TV) Oh, it's just

terrible, isn't it?

Buffy doesn't know what to say or how to react.

Opening credits roll. Buffy's theme plays.

*** Part 1 ***

The Sunnydale High School library. Buffy is sitting on the study table

and Faith is sitting in a chair at the table. Wesley paces. Giles is

sitting at the far end.

Wesley: I want you to look into this. Find out everything you can about

the murder of the Deputy Mayor.

Buffy: (nervous and confused) But that's... I-I mean, that's... That's

not really our jurisdiction, is it?

Faith: (eerily calm) It's no big, B. We'll get into it if he wants.

Giles: No, Buffy's right. The Deputy Mayor's murder was the result of

human malice. There's nothing supernatural about it.

Wesley: We don't know that for certain. (brightly) I say it merits

investigation.

Giles: (gets up, walks around the table) Which I'm sure the police are

doing. Meantime, if you ask me, there are better uses for the Slayers'

time.

Wesley: (snootily) Ah. But I don't believe I did. (holds the daily

paper out to him) Ask you.

Giles: (yanks the paper away) Considering the success of your previous

adventure...

Cordelia walks into the library. Giles looks over at her.

Cordelia: Don't let me interrupt. Wait. Let me interrupt. I'm in a

hurry. (raises her eyebrows)

Giles: What did you need?

Wesley turns to see who has spoken, and is immediately taken by her

beauty. He stares at her with his mouth agape, looking her up and down.

Cordelia: Uh, psych class. Freud and Jung. Book me?

Giles: Happily.

Cordelia: (notices Wesley, smiles) Check out Giles: The Next

Generation. What's your deal?

Wesley: (stammering nervously) Uh, I, uh... Well... (swallows) I'm a...

Faith is quite amused. She leans forward on the table.

Faith: New Watcher.

Cordelia: Oh.

Wesley: (turns to Buffy, irritated) Does everybody know about you?

Buffy: She's a friend.

Cordelia: Let's not exaggerate. So... (steps closer) You're the new

Watcher.

Wesley: (summons his poise, holds out his hand) Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.

Cordelia: (takes it) I like a man with two last names. I'm Cordelia.

Wesley: (smiles) And you teach psychology.

Cordelia: I *take* psychology.

Giles walks behind Wesley with Cordelia's books.

Giles: She's a student.

Wesley immediately drops Cordelia's hand.

Wesley: Oh, well. I, uh... (swallows) Yes. (squares his shoulders) In

fact, I am... here to watch... girls. Uh, uh, Buffy and Faith, to be

specific.

Cordelia: (steps closer, smiling brightly) Well, it's about time we got

some fresh blood around here.

Wesley: (laughs nervously) Well. Fresh. Yes.

At the checkout counter Giles stamps the due date into the books.

Giles: Here we go.

Cordelia: (to Giles) Thanks. (to Wesley) So, welcome to Sunnydale.

She gives him a bright smile and goes to retrieve her books. On her way

out she makes sure to put just the right amount of swing in her hips.

Wesley: (watching her back admiringly) My. She is cheeky, isn't she?

Faith: (still amused) Uh, first word: jail; second word: bait.

Wesley: Ahem. (pulls out his handkerchief) Well, uh... (dabs his mouth)

Where were we?

Buffy: (slips off the table) Done. I mean, we were done, right?

Faith: (stands up) Uh, yep. Off to patrol. So we'll see ya.

Wesley: (draws himself up) One moment, girls. I'm your commander now,

and on the matter of this murder, I am resolved. Natural or super, I

want to know.

Faith: Fine by me. Always ready to kick a little bad guy butt.

She touches her hand to Buffy's shoulder, and the two of them walk out.

Wesley smiles beatifically after them.

Cut to an empty classroom. The Slayers walk in. Buffy pulls the door

closed behind her. Faith checks the other door to make sure it's closed,

which it is. They meet in the center of the room.

Faith: (challengingly) So, you gonna rat me out? Is that it?

Buffy: (imploringly) Faith, we have to tell. I can't pretend to

investigate this. I can't pretend that I don't know.

Faith: (snidely) Oh, I see. But you can pretend that Angel's still dead

when you need to protect him.

Buffy: I *am* trying to protect you. Look, if-if we don't do the right

thing, it's only gonna make things worse for you.

Faith: Worse than jail for the rest of my young life? No way!

Buffy: Faith, what we did was...

Faith: (ominously) Yeah. We. You were right there beside me when this

whole thing went down. Anything I have to answer for, you do, too.

You're a part of this, B. All the way.

Faith walks out of the classroom, leaving a shocked Buffy behind.

Cut to the hall. Buffy comes out of the classroom and walks toward the

student lounge. There she sees Willow sitting alone on a couch, and goes

to her. Willow notices her coming, glances up for an instant and takes a

deep breath as she pretends to go back to her reading, apprehensive

about them meeting.

Buffy: Hey.

Willow: Hey. (Buffy sits) Where's Faith? I-I saw her around. Figured

you two were gonna go kill some more nasty stuff.

Buffy: Not right now. I-I, um, I think she bailed.

They both begin to talk again simultaneously.

Buffy: Willow, I was won...

Willow: Actually, I'm...

They both stop. Buffy lets out a deep breath.

Buffy: Um... You go ahead.

Willow: (puts her book away) I'm late. I-I'm meeting Michael. The

warlock guy? We're still trying to de-rat Amy.

Buffy: (smiles thinly) Okay.

Neither of them says anything for a long moment.

Willow: (evasively) So see ya. (gets up and goes)

Buffy: (to herself) See you.

Cut to the scene where Allan was killed. The red and blue flashing

lights of police car light bars illuminate the area. A forensic expert

takes blood and fiber samples from the dumpster as another police

officer holds a Maglite up to it. Detective Stein is also there,

interviewing a potential witness.

Det. Stein: So, uh... You heard the man scream about what time last

night?

Woman: (worriedly) Oh, I'm not sure. 7:00, maybe 8:00.

Det. Stein: Can you be more specific, say between 7:30 and 8:00?

The camera moves through the scene and finds Angel, watching from a

distance. He sees the blood on the dumpster and watches as the samples

are taken. He flashes back to the previous night when he saw the blood

on Buffy's hand.

Angel: Your hand.

Buffy: Oh. It's okay.

He's back in the present, and continues to watch all the activity.

Cut to City Hall. Cut to the Mayor's office. He puts a sheet of paper

into the shredder and listens to it whir through. He follows it with

another. The camera pans up to his face. He's not a happy Mayor.

Mayor Wilkins: It's not working.

Trick: It's supposed to do something besides shred?

Mayor Wilkins: It's *supposed* to cheer me *up*. Usually using the

shredder gives me a lift. It's fun.

Trick: And today you're not getting the ya-yas.

Mayor Wilkins: (morosely) No.

He shreds another sheet.

Mayor Wilkins: Guess it'll take more than this to turn my frown upside

down. I just *don't* understand why Allan would leave such a paper trail

about our dealings. (considers) Do you think he was gonna betray me? Oh,

now, that's a horrible thought. And now he's dead, I'll never have the

chance to scold him.

Trick: Maybe this will change your mood.

He drops a copy of the coroner's report on the desk. The Mayor picks it

up and opens it.

Mayor Wilkins: What is it?

Trick: Bombshell. The Deputy Mayor had wooden splinters in his wound.

Struck right through the heart with a sharp, pointed object. Now, word

is, someone was fighting vampires not a block away from the scene. Any

smart money says it was a Slayer who did this job.

Mayor Wilkins: Why? Do you think he talked? To them?

Trick: If he did, I'm thinking he said the wrong thing.

Mayor Wilkins: (closes the report) Well, this *is* exciting. A Slayer

up for Murder One. That's sunshine and roses to me. It really is.

He laughs as he taps the end of the report on his desk and sets it down.

*** Part 2 ***

City Hall at night. Cut to Allan's office. Faith and Buffy break in.

Buffy closes the door behind them, checking to make sure they weren't

seen. She turns on the light. They both look around the office.

Faith: (darkly) I'm telling you, we did the world a favor. (goes to his

chair) This guy was about as interesting as watching paint dry.

Buffy: (uneasily) Faith...

Faith: I'm joking. Jeez, lighten up a little, B.

She looks across his desk and notices a picture of him with the Mayor.

Buffy goes through the papers in his inbox. Faith picks up the picture

and stares at it, cradling it gently.

Faith: He came out of nowhere.

Buffy: (sympathetically) I know.

Faith: (annoyed) Whatever. (puts down the picture) I'm not lookin' to

hug and cry and learn and grow. I'm just saying it happened quick, you

know?

She pulls open his drawer. Everything inside is neat and in place. Buffy

starts to go through some papers lying on top of his filing cabinets.

Faith loses her patience.

Faith: You know what? Let's just blow. Who cares what this guy was

about? It's kind of moot now, don't you think?

Buffy: I don't think he was in that alley by chance. I think he was

looking for us. I'd like to know why.

She opens a file drawer. It's empty.

Faith: So, what, you think there's some big conspiracy?

Buffy closes the drawer and opens another. All the folders in it are

also empty.

Buffy: You were saying?

Faith: So his papers are gone. That doesn't prove anything.

Buffy: Except that somebody didn't want us to prove anything.

Faith begins to get it.

Cut to the hall. Buffy opens the door and peeks out. The hall is clear,

so she steps out into it. Just then the Mayor's door opens further down

the hall, and Mr. Trick steps out. The Mayor is right behind him. Buffy

looks back at Faith, and they both scramble back into Allan's office and

close the door quietly. They can still hear them talking out in the

hall.

Mayor Wilkins: Get as many men on it as you can.

Trick: Yeah. We'll be wanting to turn up the heat.

Cut to the streets. Buffy and Faith step off the sidewalk and into the

street.

Faith: So the Mayor of Sunnydale is a Black Hat. That's a shocker, huh?

Buffy: Actually, yeah. I didn't get the bad guy vibe off of him.

Faith: (exasperated) When are you gonna learn, B? It doesn't matter

what kind of vibe you get off a person. 'Cause nine times out of ten,

the face they're showing you is not the real one.

They step up onto the opposite sidewalk.

Buffy: (evenly) I guess you know a lot about that.

Faith: (stops and faces Buffy) What is that supposed to mean?

Buffy: It's just, look at you, Faith. Less than twenty-four hours ago,

you killed a man. A-and now it's all zip-a-dee-doo-dah? It's not *your*

real face, and I know it. Look, I know what you're feeling because I'm

feeling it, too.

Faith: (insolently) Do you? So fill me in 'cause I'd like to hear this.

Buffy: Dirty. Like something sick creeped inside you and you can't get

it out. And you keep hoping that it was just some nightmare, but it

wasn't. And we are gonna have to figure out...

Faith: (interrupts) Is there gonna be an intermission in this?

Buffy: Just let me talk to Giles, okay? I swear...

Faith: No! We're not bringing *anybody* else into this. You gotta keep

your head, B. This is all gonna blow over in a few days.

Buffy: And if it doesn't?

Faith: If it doesn't, (shrugs) they got a freighter leaving the docks

at least twice a day. It ain't fancy, but it gets you gone.

Buffy: (in disbelief) And that's it? You just live with it? You see the

dead guy in your head every day for the rest of your life?

Faith: (steps closer) Buffy, I'm not gonna *see* anything. I missed the

mark last night and I'm sorry about the guy. I really am! But it

happens! Anyway, how many people do you think we've saved by now,

thousands? And didn't you stop the world from ending? Because in my

book, that puts you and me in the plus column.

Buffy: We help people! It doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.

Faith: Why not? The guy I offed was no Gandhi. I mean, we just saw he

was mixed up in dirty dealings.

Buffy: Maybe, but what if he was coming to us for help?

Faith: What if he was? You're still not seeing the big picture, B.

Something made us different. We're warriors. We're built to kill.

Buffy: To kill demons! But it does *not* mean that we get to pass

judgment on people like we're better than everybody else!

Faith: We *are* better!

Buffy is taken aback.

Faith: (exhilarated) That's right, better. People need us to survive.

In the balance, nobody's gonna cry over some random bystander who got

caught in the crossfire.

Buffy: (sadly) I am.

Faith: (disdainfully) Well, that's your loss.

She turns her back on Buffy and walks away.

Cut to Buffy's house. Her mother sees her coming and meets her at the

door. When she opens it, Buffy can see Detective Stein standing behind

her.

Joyce: Buffy.

Buffy looks at him, eyes widening, remembering him from before.

Cut to the living room. Joyce sits in an armchair with her feet together

and her hands folded in her lap, listening to the detective question her

daughter. Buffy sits on the couch across from her.

Det. Stein: Tell me again. You got home at what time last night?

Buffy: Late. Um, a-a little past 1:00, I guess.

The camera pans around Detective Stein as he asks his next question, and

when it moves away from his back he's talking with Faith in her room.

Det. Stein: Maybe you can explain to me what a girl your age is doing

out all night.

Faith: (playing dumb) Just hanging.

Det. Stein: Hanging. By yourself?

Faith: No. I was with my friend Buffy.

Cut to Buffy.

Buffy: We were at Faith's watching TV.

Joyce listens anxiously to them.

Det. Stein: What did you watch?

Cut to Faith.

Faith: Some old movie.

Cut to Buffy.

Buffy: Infomercial.

Cut to Faith.

Det. Stein: Hmm. (nods) That's funny 'cause I got a couple of witnesses

who put you near the alley.

Faith: (innocently) Witnesses?

He walks around her, eyeing her suspiciously.

Det. Stein: Somebody stabbed this guy through the heart.

Cut to Buffy.

Det. Stein: Strange thing is, the weapon, it was made out of wood.

Cut to Faith.

Det: Stein: Any of this mean anything to you?

Faith: (flippantly) Yeah. That whoever did it wasn't hip to the Bronze

Age.

Detective Stein inhales deeply and sighs. Cut to Buffy.

Buffy: Is that it? I'm kinda beat.

Det. Stein: Yeah, I have enough for now. Buffy, if you know something,

if you're protecting someone, I promise you it'll be better for everyone

if you just come clean.

Cut to Faith.

Faith: You mean am I covering for someone? Hardly. I'm not the throw-

myself-on-the-sword type.

Cut to Buffy.

Buffy: (politely) I wish I could help you.

Det. Stein: Well, call me if you remember anything.

Cut to Faith. Detective Stein hands her his card. Cut outside her hotel

room. He pulls the door closed, takes out his keys and walks to his car.

He opens the door, gets in and starts the engine. In the shadows beyond

Angel watches him. Detective Stein puts the car in gear and drives off.

Cut to Willow's room. She's at her laptop doing research. She hears a

tapping at her French doors, and goes to open them. There she sees Buffy

looking in sadly.

Buffy: Hey.

Willow: Hey.

Buffy: I need to talk to you.

Willow: Good. (Buffy comes in, closes the door) 'Cause I've been

letting things fester. (goes to her bed) And I don't like it. (sits) I

wanna be fester-free.

Buffy: (smiles weakly) Yeah. Me, too.

Willow: (stands up) I mean, don't get me wrong. I-I completely

understand why you and Faith have been doing the bonding thing. You guys

work together. You... You should get along.

Buffy: It's more complicated than that.

Willow: But, see, it's that exact thing that-that's just ticking me

off! It's this whole 'Slayers only' attitude. I mean, since when

wouldn't I understand? You, you talk to me about *everything*. I-it's

like all of a sudden I-I'm not cool enough for you because I can't kill

things with my bare hands.

Buffy suddenly bursts into tears. Willow is aghast at this result.

Willow: (regretfully) Oh! Oh, Buffy! Don't cry. (hugs her close) I'm

sorry. I-I was too hard on you. (lets go) Sometimes I unleash. I-I don't

know my own strength. I-i-it's bad. I-I-I'm bad. I'm a bad, bad, bad

person. (looks for forgiveness)

Buffy: (tearfully) Will, I'm in trouble.

Cut to later, after they've calmed down and Buffy's explained. They sit

on Willow's bed.

Buffy: And Faith acts like she doesn't even care. The way she talks,

it's like she didn't even make a mistake.

Willow: (takes it all in) Do you think she's, like, i-in shock?

Buffy: (sighs) I don't know. And I think that detective knows more than

he's saying. I think he knew that I was lying.

Willow: (decisively) You have to go to Giles, Buffy. He'll know what to

do.

Buffy lets out a deep breath, knowing that her friend is right.

Cut to the library. Buffy comes in quietly and walks past the counter.

Buffy: (troubled) Giles?

She stops when she sees him come out of his office.

Giles: Buffy.

Buffy: Uh... (exhales) I don't really know how to say this, so I'm-

I'm... I'm just gonna say it. I know I've kept things from you before,

but...

Giles turns his head slightly as Faith comes out of his office, too.

Faith gives her a steely look, like she expects Buffy to keep things

quiet.

Buffy: (fumbling) But, um, but I-I've been blowing off my classes. You

know, in-in the sense of not attending. And, uh...

Faith: It's okay, Buffy. I told him.

Buffy: (surprised) You told him?

Faith: I had to. He had to know what you did.

Buffy: (confused) What I did?

She realizes that Faith has told Giles a bald-faced lie.

Buffy: Giles, no. Tha-That's just not what happened.

Giles: (upset) I don't want to hear it, Buffy.

Buffy: (shocked) No! It...

Giles: I don't want to hear any more lies.

Buffy: (frantically to Faith) You can't be serious! You're setting me

up?

Giles: Get in my office, now. Faith, I'll talk to you in the morning.

Buffy: (imploringly) Giles, please, you have to...

Giles: (sternly) Now!

Buffy can't believe what's happening. Faith walks around Giles. Buffy

goes into his office. Faith stops and faces him.

Faith: Um... Sorry.

She leaves at a brisk pace.

Giles looks down for a moment, then goes into his office. Inside Buffy

faces him.

Buffy: (desperately) Giles, I didn't do this. I swear. Look, I know

that I messed up badly, but the murder, i-it... it was...

Giles: (interrupts) Faith. I know.

Stunned, Buffy realizes he was just playing Faith's game.

Giles: She may have many talents, Buffy, but fortunately, lying is not

one of them.

Buffy: Oh. Oh, God. (sits) I thought...

Giles: I'm sorry. I needed her to think that I was on her side. I don't

know how far she'll take this charade.

Buffy: Try far. Like, all the way.

Giles: You should have come to me right off. (sits facing her)

Buffy: I know. Well, I, I wanted to.

Giles: But Faith wouldn't hear of it?

Buffy: It's not all her fault, Giles. We both thought it was a vampire.

I-I only realized it a second before.

Giles: Buffy, this is not the first time something like this has

happened.

Buffy: (confused) It's not?

Giles: The Slayer is on the front line of a nightly war. Now, it's,

it's tragic, but accidents have happened.

Buffy: W-what do you do?

Giles: Well, the Council investigates, um, metes out punishment if

punishment is due. But I... I have no plans to involve them. I mean,

it's the last thing Faith needs at the moment. She's unstable, Buffy. I

mean, she's utterly unable to accept responsibility.

Buffy: She's freaking. So, so then we just have to help her deal,

right?

Giles: She's in denial. There *is* no help for her until she admits

what happened.

Buffy: (uncertainly) I-I could talk to her.

Giles: (sighs) Perhaps.

Buffy: Or maybe I'm too close. Maybe, maybe one of the guys could.

Giles: We should meet. It-it may be that they're seeing a different

side of her.

Buffy: Okay.

Cut to the main area looking into the office. The camera pans past the

window.

Giles: In the meantime, no one else is to know. Understood?

Buffy: Of course.

The camera keeps panning until it comes to rest on Wesley, who is

standing by the counter, arms crossed and listening grimly.

Giles: I mean, this is... extremely delicate. If we scare her off now,

we may lose her forever.

*** Part 3 ***

Wesley's apartment. He picks up the phone and dials an international

number.

Wesley: Yes, hello. Mr. Travers, please. Quentin Travers. (listens)

Wesley Wyndam-Pryce calling. (listens, confused) The code word? Monkey.

(listens, exasperated) M-o-n-k... Just put him on, will you? This is an

emergency.

Willow: Well, maybe we should all talk to Faith together.

Cut to the cafeteria. She, Buffy, Xander and Giles sit among the tables,

which have the chairs inverted on them for the night.

Buffy: You mean, like that intervention thing that you guys did on me?

As I recall, Xander and I nearly came to blows.

Xander: Uh, *you* nearly came to blows, Buffy. I nearly came to loss of

limbs.

Giles: No, Faith is too defensive for a confrontation like that. She'll

respond better to a one-on-one approach.

Xander: Well, *I* can be the one... on her one. (gets confused looks)

Let's rephrase. I think she might listen to me. We kind of have, um, a

connection.

Buffy: A connection? Why would you think that...

Xander: (interrupts) I'm just saying it's worth a shot. That's all.

Buffy and Willow exchange a look.

Giles: No, I don't, I don't see it, Xander. I mean, of, of all of us,

you're the one person arguably that Faith has had the least contact

with.

Xander: Yeah, but we hung out a little... recently, and she seemed to

be, um... responsive.

Willow picks up on that, and figures it out. She looks sadly off into

space.

Buffy: When did you guys hang out?

Xander: Oh, she was fighting one of those, uh, apocalypse demon things,

and I helped her. Gave her a ride home.

Buffy: And you guys talked?

Xander: (shakes his head) Not extensively. No.

Buffy: Then why would you... (figures it out also, widens her eyes with

surprise) Oh.

Giles: (gets it, surprised) Oh!

He and Buffy both look at Willow, concerned. She notices and looks up.

Willow: I don't need to say 'oh'. I got it before. They slept together.

Buffy is genuinely sorry that she had to hear it like this. Willow looks

back off into space. A long silence follows. The tension in the air is

very thick. Giles finally breaks it.

Giles: Fine, fine, let's, let's, let's move on.

Buffy: Alright. Look, I-I know that you mean well, Xander, but, um, I-I

just don't see Faith opening up to you. (gently) She doesn't take the

guys that she has a... 'connection' with very seriously. And they're,

they're kind of a big joke to her. No offense.

Xander: (guffaws, sarcastically) Oh, no! I mean, why would I be

offended by *that*?

Giles: However, i-if you still want to be of assistance, I, I, I need

some help with research. There's still the business of the Mayor and Mr.

Trick to attend to.

Buffy: Yeah, they, they seemed pretty cozy the other night.

Giles: Yes. Uh, Willow, c-c-can you, um, access the Mayor's files?

Willow: (comes back to Earth) What? Oh, uh, sure. I can try.

Giles: (stands up) Good, yes, because clearly we, uh, (picks up his

chair) we need to take a harder look at him. (turns it over) He's, he's,

um, he's obviously up to something. (sets it on a table)

Buffy: What about Faith?

Giles: (sighs) I don't know. I need time.

Buffy: She needs help now. (Giles looks at her) I owe her that.

Cut to the girls' bathroom. The camera pulls in to a stall with its door

not quite closed. "Wish We Never Met", by Kathleen Wilhoite, plays over

the scene.

Lyrics: Disappointment stops by from time to time

The sound of sobbing is coming from inside the stall. Cut inside. Willow

sits there crying her eyes out.

Lyrics: To see how I'm doing / And he came by last night right after

you left / My life in ruin

Cut to the library. Xander sits on the steps to the stack level, staring

off into space and tapping his fingers.

Lyrics: When I don't get what I want

Cut to Faith's room. She's lying on her bed, idly watching TV.

Lyrics: The spoiled child inside breaks down

She hears a knock at her door. She rolls off her bed and goes to answer

it. It's Xander.

Faith: (bored) What?

Xander: (awkwardly) I just, uh, came by to see how you are, actually.

Faith: (with hostility) I'm sick of people asking me that, for one

thing.

A long moment of silence ensues.

Xander: Can I come in? Just to talk. I promise.

Faith: (skeptical) Like you could make something happen if I didn't

want it to?

Xander: Hey, yeah. Got me there. Pretty much not gonna try to... take

you under any circumstances. (holds out his arm) See, here, feel that.

(points to his biceps) Probably like a wet noodle to you, huh?

Faith: (steps aside) Five minutes.

Xander: That's all I need. (comes in) For talking and conversation.

(Faith closes the door) I'm, um, quick as a bunny.

Faith: (turns off the TV) Clock is running.

Xander: It's just, uh... I heard about what happened, and I thought you

might need a friend.

Faith: So then, go talk to Buffy. She's the one who killed a guy.

Xander: Yeah. I heard that version.

Faith: (not amused) Version?

Xander: (sighs) Either way, i-it sounds like it was an accident, and

that's the important part.

Faith: (angrily) No, the important part is that Buffy is the (makes

finger quotes) accidental murderer.

Xander: Faith, you may not think so, but I sort of know you. And I've

seen you post-battle. And I know firsthand that you're, um... like a

wild thing. And half the time, you don't know what you're doing.

Faith: (snidely) And you're living proof of that, aren't you?

Xander: See, you're trying to hurt me. But right now, you need someone

on your side. What happened wasn't your fault. And I'm willing to

testify to that in court if you need me.

Faith: You'd dig that, wouldn't you? (gives him a sexy look) To get up

in front of all your geek pals and go on record about how I made you my

boy toy for a night.

Xander: No. N-n-n-n-no, that's not it.

Faith: *I* know what this is all about. (steps closer) You just came by

here (runs her fingertips all around his face) 'cause you want another

taste, don't you?

Xander: No! I mean, it was nice. It was great. It was kind of a blur.

But, okay, some day, sure, yay, but not now. Not like this.

Faith: (grabs hold of his head) More like how then? Lights on or off?

Kinks or vanilla?

Xander: (jerks away) Faith, come on. I came here to help you. (looks

her in the eyes) I thought we had a connection.

Faith can't help but think that's funny and laughs at his gullibility.

She grabs him by his shirt front, shoves him onto the bed and jumps on

top of him.

Faith: (excitedly) You wanna feel a connection? It's just skin. (opens

his shirt) I see... I want... I take. (kisses him hard) I forget.

She keeps moving above him and rubbing his chest and shoulders.

Xander: (nervously) No. No, wait. It was more than that.

Faith: I could do anything to you right now, and you want me to. I can

make you scream.

She licks her tongue over and around his face and returns to his lips,

and kisses him forcefully, seizing his lower lip between her teeth and

pulling at it.

Faith: (breathlessly) I could make you die.

She kisses him again and gets her hand around his neck. When she pulls

away from his lips, he's choking. She kisses him once more, and then

rises above him, never letting up on her chokehold. Xander reaches up

with one hand to try to push her away and tries to pry her hand from his

neck with his other hand, but doesn't have anywhere near the strength

necessary to do so. Faith has both hands tight around his neck now, and

squeezes hard. He begins to lose consciousness. A few moments more and

he's passed out. Faith hears a noise behind her and looks over just in

time to be knocked unconscious by Angel.

Cut to Angel's mansion. Faith is chained to the fireplace mantle. She

rubs her wrists.

Faith: Finally decided to tie me up, huh? I always knew you weren't

really a one-Slayer guy.

Angel: (plays with a bat) I'm sorry about the chains. It's not that I

don't trust you... Actually, it *is* that I don't trust you. (sets the

bat aside)

Faith: The thing with Xander; I know what it looked like, but we were

just playing.

Angel: (evenly) And he forgot the safety word. (gets up) Is that it?

(walks over to her)

Faith: Safety words are for wusses.

Angel: (crouches before her) I bet you're not big on trust games, now,

are you, Faith?

Faith: You gonna shrink me now? Is that it?

Angel: No, I just wanna talk to you.

Faith: That's what they all say. And then it's just, 'Lemme stay the

night. Won't try anything.'

Angel: You wanna go the long way around, hey, I can do that. (stands

up) I'm not getting any older.

He turns his back on her and walks out into the atrium. Buffy waits

there, and stands up when she sees him.

Buffy: How's she doing?

Angel: It's like talking to a wall. Only you get more from a wall.

Buffy: But you'll keep trying, right?

Angel: Sure. We're just getting started.

Buffy: So, what do I do?

Angel: Look, right now, there's nothing that you can do.

Buffy: Well, this could take awhile, right? (goes to the stairs) So,

I'll just go to Faith's and I'll get some of her stuff. That way she'll

see that we're on her side.

Angel: That's a good idea.

Buffy: Okay. (glances at Faith) I'll be back.

Angel: Look, I... I don't want you to get your hopes up, Buffy. She may

not want us to help her.

Buffy: She does. She just doesn't know how to say it.

Angel: She killed a man. That changes everything for her.

Buffy: (shakes her head) Giles said with counseling, they might not

even need to lock her up.

Angel: That's not what I mean. She's taken a life.

Buffy: I know.

Angel: She's got a taste for it now.

Cut to the Mayor's office. He and Trick are reviewing a security camera

tape. On it they see Buffy and Faith enter Allan's office.

Mayor Wilkins: Not one Slayer, but two. Right here in the building.

Trick: There was supposed to be a guard.

Mayor Wilkins: Sh. Here comes my favorite part. (they see them hide in

Allan's office) Where the Slayers see us in the hall together, thick as

thieves. Oh, wait, we are thieves. And worse. And now they know it.

Trick: Well, they're not gonna be much of a threat in jail.

Mayor Wilkins: Well, we don't have near enough evidence to put 'em

away.

On the tape he and Trick walk out of the building.

Mayor Wilkins: No, you're gonna have to come up with a more *efficient*

solution. And Mr. Trick, you better think of it soon.

They watch the tape where the two Slayers leave the office after they've

gone.

Cut to Angel's mansion. He paces past Faith.

Angel: I know what's goin' on with you.

Faith: Join the club. Everybody seems to have a theory.

Angel: Hmm. (faces her) But I know what it's like to take a life. To

feel a future, a world of possibilities, snuffed out by your own hand. I

know the power in it. The exhilaration. It was like a drug for me.

Faith: (looks up at him, sarcastically) Yeah? Sounds like you need some

help. A professional maybe.

Angel: Hmm. (goes to the coffee table) A professional couldn't have

helped me. (sits on it) It stopped when I got my soul back. My human

heart.

Faith: Goody for you. If we're gonna party, let's get on with it.

(holds out her wrists) Otherwise, could you let me out of these things?

Angel: Faith, you have a choice. You've tasted something few ever do.

(stands up, paces) I mean, to kill without remorse is to feel like a

god.

Faith: (struggles angrily) Right now, all I feel is a cramp in my

wrist, (yanks at the chains impatiently) so let me go!

Angel: (crouches) But you're not a god. You're not much more than a

child. Going down this path will ruin you. You can't imagine the price

for true evil.

Faith: Yeah? (sneering) I hope evil takes MasterCard.

Angel: (smiles) You and me, Faith, (straightens up) we're a lot alike.

Time was, I thought humans existed just to hurt each other. (sits next

to her) But then I came here. And I found out that there are other types

of people. People who genuinely wanted to do right. (looks at her) And

they make mistakes. And they fall down. You know, but they keep caring.

Keep trying. If you can trust us, Faith, this can all change. You don't

have to disappear into the darkness.

Suddenly there is a loud pounding on the door. It is broken in, and

Wesley strides straight toward them, holding a large cross and flanked

by three others. Angel rushes to head them off, but has to step back

from Wesley, who nervously holds the cross in his face. One of his

cronies blindsides Angel with a right hook, and he falls to the floor.

Another quickly throws a net over him, and the third starts to beat him

with a crowbar while the others tie Angel up. Wesley goes over to Faith

and removes the shackles from her wrists. While she rubs them and

watches Angel get whaled on, Wesley pulls out a set of heavy cuffs and

chains, and before she knows it her wrists are bound once again.

Faith: (confused) What?

Wesley: By the order of the Watcher's Council of Britain... (lifts her

up) I am exercising my authority and removing you to England, (guides

her out) where you will accept the judgment of the disciplinary

committee.

One of the men helps hold Faith, and they all leave the mansion, leaving

Angel behind entangled in a mass of net and rope.

*** Part 4 ***

The streets of Sunnydale. A stepvan drives down a boulevard. Cut inside.

Faith is chained to a bench on one side. Wesley and one of his men sit

on the bench opposite her.

Wesley: I'm sorry for the extreme measures. Unfortunately, this is a

rather extreme circumstance.

Faith: Whatever.

Wesley: Please believe nobody is rushing to judgment. The first

priority of both myself and the Council is to help you.

Faith pulls at the ring holding her to the bench.

Wesley: Ah, now, none of that. (to his crony) Tighten her restraints.

Faith, there's no point in fighting this.

Faith kicks the man in the knee, and he falls to the floor. She presses

down on his face with her boot.

Faith: Have to disagree with you on that one. Now unlock these or I'll

pop this guy's head like a grape.

Wesley hesitates, then spies a wrench on the floor. Faith sees it, too.

Faith: Don't even think about it.

She holds up her cuffed wrists for him to unlock. He gives in, stands

up, pulls the keys from his pocket and steps over to set her free.

Wesley: Faith, you can't keep running.

She punches him hard in the jaw, and he falls onto the wrench. He grabs

it and tries to swing at her with it, but she grabs his wrist.

Faith: Wrong again, Wes.

She grabs his jacket with her other hand and headbutts him hard. He

falls down unconscious. She goes to the doors, kicks them open and jumps

out onto the street. She rolls a few times before coming to a stop and

watches the van drive away. She looks around to get her bearings and

makes her getaway.

Cut to Angel's mansion. Buffy arrives with some of Faith's things. Once

inside she notices that Faith is gone, and then sees Angel still

struggling to get out of the ropes. She rushes over to help him out.

Cut to the library. Giles, Willow and Xander are all there with Buffy

and Angel.

Angel: It was the new Watcher. He had a couple of guys helping him.

Willow: Then he figured it out?

Giles: Which means that Faith will be soon on her way back to England

to face the Watcher's Council.

Buffy: And then what?

Giles: Most likely they'll lock her away for a good long while.

Buffy: So we head them off at the airport and stop them.

Willow: Can I... I-I'm just wondering. Why? (gets a look from Buffy)

I'm not the most objective, I know. I kind of have an issue with Faith

sharing my people. (looks at Xander, who closes his eyes) But she

murdered someone and accused Buffy. Then she hurt Xander. I hate to say

it, but maybe she belongs behind bars.

Giles thinks about that.

Buffy: She's out of control, I know. But Angel was getting somewhere

with her. She was opening up. If we could just stop Wesley.

Wesley walks into the library.

Wesley: That's no longer an issue.

Giles: You let her get away?

Wesley: 'Let' wouldn't be the way I'd phrase it, but... Yes, she

escaped.

Giles rolls his eyes and takes off his glasses.

Angel: That's good work. (walks across the room) First, you terrorize

her, then you put her back in the streets. (sits on the table)

Wesley: That was hardly my plan. I was trying to save her.

Buffy: (accusingly) But you didn't! You probably destroyed her.

Giles: (interrupts quietly) Buffy, that's enough. (puts his glasses

back on)

Buffy: I better find her before she does any more damage. (stands up)

We're gonna need to split up. I'll check the docks. That's probably

where she is. Giles, why don't you go to her motel? Xander, Willow, her

haunts and be careful.

They all get up to leave.

Angel: I'll try the airport. (goes)

Everyone walks past Wesley on their way out.

Wesley: What can I do? I want to help.

Buffy: (resentfully) You still got your ticket back to the mother

country?

She follows the others out, leaving him standing there alone.

Cut to the docks. The camera closes in on an old, rusty cargo ship and

across to the dock. Buffy walks along it watching for Faith. She passes

underneath the gangplank and stops when she hears Faith behind her.

Faith: You don't give up, do you?

She's on the ship at the top of the gangplank.

Buffy: Not on my friends, no.

Faith: Yeah, because you and me are such solid buds, right? (walks down

the gangplank)

Buffy: We could be. It's not too late.

Faith: (disgusted) For me to change and be more like you, you mean?

Little Miss Goody-Two-Shoes? (stops halfway, leans on the railing) It

ain't gonna happen, B.

Buffy: Faith, nobody is asking you to be like me, but you can't go on

like this.

Faith: (grins evilly) Scares you, doesn't it?

She climbs over the railing and hops down to the dock.

Buffy: Yeah, it scares me. Faith, you're hurting people. You're hurting

yourself.

Faith: (approaches Buffy) But that's not it. That's not what bothers

you so much. What bugs you is you know I'm right. You know in your gut

we don't need the law. We *are* the law.

Buffy: No.

She turns her back and walks away. Faith follows right behind.

Faith: Yes. You know exactly what I'm about 'cause you have it in you,

too.

Buffy: No, Faith, you're sick.

Faith: I've seen it, B. You've got the lust. And I'm not just talking

about screwing vampires.

Buffy stops in her tracks.

Buffy: Don't you *dare* bring him into this.

Faith: (taunting her) It was good, wasn't it? The sex? The danger? Bet

a part of you even dug him when he went psycho.

Buffy: No! (continues walking)

Faith: (follows) See, you need me to toe the line because you're afraid

you'll go over it, aren't you, B? You can't handle watching me living my

own way, having a blast, because it tempts you! You know it could be

you!

Buffy has had enough. She stops, faces her and backhand punches her in

the jaw. Faith comes up smiling wickedly.

Faith: There's my girl.

Buffy: (tries to get away) No. I'm not gonna do this.

Faith: (doesn't let her go) Why not? It feels good. Blood rising.

Buffy hears a noise above, looks up and notices a palette of crates

above them, falling directly at Faith. She shoves her out of the way,

but gets struck herself and goes down. She is dazed, but not out.

Faith gets up and goes to help Buffy, when Mr. Trick and three other

vampires suddenly attack. Faith spins around when she hears them roar,

but is soundly punched in the face by Trick, forcing her body to snap to

the side. He and another one grab her by her jacket and throw her to the

ground. As Faith tries to get to her feet, the second vampire roundhouse

kicks her in the face. She blocks it and drops a bit, but manages to get

up and block an uppercut from the third one by grabbing his hand. She

backhand punches him in the face, making him step back to keep his

balance, and turns to face the second vampire. She high blocks a wide

swing from him and punches him, making him fall, but the third one

behind her flat hands her in the back and she stumbles.

Buffy starts to come out of her daze.

Buffy: (whispers) Oh, God...

The third vampire holds Faith with her arms behind her back. She tries

to get free by snapping her heel backwards and striking his kneecap.

That has no effect, so she snaps her head back and butts him dead in the

nose, but the vamp still doesn't let go of her. The second vampire

launches into a half spinning hook kick intended for Faith, but she

ducks it and the demon holding her takes the blow, lets go of her and

goes down. Faith flies into full spinning, jumping out-to-in crescent

kick, hitting the second vampire hard in the face and sending him

spinning to the ground. The first vampire runs at her, but she sidesteps

him and shoves him into the third, who was just getting up. He isn't

knocked down, though, and comes at her. She grabs him and pulls him with

her toward the water, and throws him off the dock.

Buffy is out of her daze now, and with difficulty pulls her legs out

from under the pallet of crates that fell on her. She gets to her feet,

but is immediately punched by Mr. Trick. She falls spinning onto the

crates and rolls off onto the concrete. She gets to her feet as Trick

approaches and tries to backhand punch him, but he middle blocks it, so

she punches him in the gut instead. Her jab is weak, though, and has no

effect on him. Trick does a painful right hook to her face. Buffy

stumbles backward. Trick advances and swings again, this time snapping

her head back with a powerful uppercut, making her fall onto another

pile of crates.

Faith does a half-spinning hook kick, connecting with the second

vampire's jaw. He falls onto an open barrel and struggles not to fall

in. The first one comes at her again, but she has her stake out now and

jams it home. He explodes into ashes. She looks over and sees Buffy

struggling with Mr. Trick. He wraps a cord around her neck and begins to

choke her. But Faith isn't finished with her fight yet. The second

vampire throws off the barrel, only to become intimate with her stake

and burst into ashes.

Faith sees Trick yank at the cord around Buffy's neck and pull her off

of the crates. He pulls her up and swings her around into a pallet

leaning against still more crates. She hits it hard and falls to the

pavement. Faith looks around, trying to decide what to do. She sees

Trick pick Buffy up again and slam her against the huge crates. Buffy

struggles to get loose, but the cord around her neck is too tight.

Trick: I hear once you've tasted a Slayer, you never wanna go back.

He opens his fang-filled mouth wide and moves in for the bite. Buffy

struggles to keep him away, but can't. Suddenly Mr. Trick stops and

looks up in wide-eyed shock.

Trick: Oh, no. (shakes his head) No, this is no good at all.

He begins to fall and explodes into ashes as Faith pulls her stake back.

The two Slayers look at each other uncertainly for a long while. Faith

lowers her stake. Buffy massages her neck.

Cut to the library. Buffy sits at the table while Giles pours her some

coffee from his thermos.

Giles: So she saved you. (walks slowly around the table)

Buffy: She could have left me there to die, Giles, but she didn't.

Giles: She opted to come back to town with you. That... That bodes

well. (sits) She still has a lot to face before she can put this behind

her.

Buffy: I'm not gonna give up on her.

Giles: (pours himself a cup) Then I think she stands a chance.

Cut to the Mayor's office. He pulls on his overcoat, getting ready to

leave for the night. He looks down at his desk and adjusts the angle of

the penholder, gives a satisfied nod, picks up his briefcase and heads

for the door. When he opens it he is surprised to see Faith standing

there, arms crossed.

Faith: (accusingly) You sent your boy to kill me.

Mayor Wilkins: (unfazed) That's right, I did.

Faith: He's dust.

Mayor Wilkins: I thought he might be. What with you standing here and

all.

Faith: (steps brazenly into the doorway) I guess that means you have a

job opening.

The Mayor steps back to let her enter and closes the door.
