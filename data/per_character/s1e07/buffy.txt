sorry
so
what'd
you

all
day
my
diary
you
read
my
diary
that
is
not
okay
a
diary
is
like
a
person's
most
private
place
i
you
don't
even
know
what
i
was
writing
about
'hunk'
can
mean
a
lot
of
things
bad
things
and
and
when
it
says
that
your
eyes
are
'penetrating'
i
meant
to
write
'bulging'
and
'a'
doesn't
even
stand
for
'angel'
for
that
matter
it
stands
for
'achmed'
a
charming
foreign
exchange
student
so
that
whole
fantasy
part
has
nothing
to
even
do
with
you
at
all
oh
oh
hey
no
big
water
over
the
bridge
under
the
bridge
over
the
dam
kiss
me
hhow
much
older
go
you
said
what
what
is
it
what's
wrong
uh
nothing
i
saw
a
shadow
i
can't
believe
this
is
happening
one
minute
we
were
kissing
and
the
next
minute
can
a
vampire
ever
be
a
good
person
couldn't
it
happen
well
then
what
was
he
doing
why
was
he
good
to
me
was
it
all
some
part
of
the
master's
plan
it
doesn't
make
sense
you
think
we
have
problems
they
got
that
right
yeah
it's
a
it's
a
bird
or
something
huh
two
hundred
and
forty
well
he
said
he
was
older
he
could've
fed
on
me
he
didn't
huh
oh
um
reconstruction
uh
reconstruction
began
after
the
construction
which
was
shoddy
so
they
had
to
reconstruct
right
civil
war
during
which
angel
was
already
like
a
hundred
and
change
you
want
xander
you've
gotta
speak
up
girl
unbelievable
no
it's
okay
i
need
to
hear
this
i
need
to
get
over
him
so
i
can
like
xander
said
i'm
the
slayer
and
he's
a
vampire
god
i
can't
he's
never
done
anything
to
hurt
me
okay
no
i
need
to
stop
thinking
about
this
okay
let's
give
another
half
an
hour
and
maybe
something
will
sink
in
and
then
i'm
going
home
for
some
major
moping
hey
i'm
home
you're
not
welcome
here
you
come
near
us
and
i'll
kill
you
mom
mom
can
you
hear
me
yes
i
need
an
ambulance
1630
revello
drive
my
mother
cut
herself
she
lost
a
lot
of
blood
please
please
hurry
mom
angel
do
you
remember
anything
mom
my
friend
oh
um
no
mom
this
is
mr
giles
get
some
rest
now
she's
gonna
be
okay
they
they
gave
her
some
iron
her
uh
blood
count
was
a
a
little
lucky
stupid
no
i
invited
him
into
my
home
even
after
i
knew
who
he
was
what
he
was
and
i
didn't
do
anything
about
it
'cause
i
had
feelings
for
him
because
i
cared
about
him
killing
them
maybe
not
but
i
think
it's
a
start
you
can't
stop
me
the
three
found
me
near
the
bronze
and
so
did
he
he
lives
nearby
so
do
i
i
know
you're
there
and
i
know
what
you
are
you're
not
an
animal
animals
i
like
why
why
didn't
you
just
attack
me
when
you
had
the
chance
was
it
a
joke
to
make
me
feel
for
you
and
then
i've
killed
a
lot
of
vampires
i've
never
hated
one
before
i
invited
you
into
my
home
and
then
you
attacked
my
family
what
changed
her
clan
what
they
were
all
out
of
boils
and
blinding
torment
so
you
started
with
my
mom
then
why
didn't
you
say
something
go
ahead
not
as
easy
as
it
looks
bad
hair
on
top
of
that
outfit
you
guys
were
involved
well
you
been
around
since
columbus
you
are
bound
to
pile
up
a
few
ex's
you're
older
than
him
right
just
between
us
girls
you
are
looking
a
little
worn
around
the
eyes
i
know
i
didn't
okay
so
what's
the
difference
between
this
and
the
pre
fumigation
party
nah
it's
weird
though
in
his
way
i
feel
like
he's
still
watching
me
we're
both
good
you
ever
be
anything
i
know
for
one
thing
you're
like
two
hundred
and
twentyfour
years
older
than
i
am
i
know
me
too
one
of
us
has
to
go
here
you
okay
painful
i
know
see
you
around
