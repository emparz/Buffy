zachary
didn't
return
from
the
hunt
last
night
zachary
was
strong
and
he
was
careful
and
still
the
slayer
takes
him
as
she
has
taken
so
many
of
my
family
it
wears
thin
collin
what
would
you
do
about
it
out
of
the
mouths
of
babes
you
have
a
personal
interest
in
this
i
will
send
the
three
pay
attention
child
you
are
the
anointed
and
there
is
much
you
must
learn
with
power
comes
responsibility
true
they
did
fail
but
also
true
we
who
walk
at
night
share
a
common
bond
the
taking
of
a
life

i'm
not
talking
about
humans
of
course

is
a
serious
matter
hmm
i
am
weary
and
their
deaths
will
bring
me
little
joy
of
course
sometimes
a
little
is
enough
how
can
my
children
learn
if
i
do
everything
for
them
oh
you're
giving
me
orders
now
do
i
sense
a
plan
darla
share
angel
he
was
the
most
vicious
creature
i
ever
met
i
miss
him
why
would
he
kill
her
if
he
feels
for
her
hmm
you
see
how
we
all
work
together
for
the
common
good
that's
how
a
family
is
supposed
to
function
how
dare
you
she
was
my
favorite
for
four
hundred
years
but
to
lose
her
to
angel
he
was
to
have
sat
at
my
right
hand
come
the
day
and
now
