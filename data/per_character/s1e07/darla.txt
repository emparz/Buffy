the
slayer
let
me
do
it
master
let
me
kill
her
for
you
i
don't
get
to
have
any
fun
the
three
a
friend
hi
it's
been
a
while
or
two
but
who's
counting
and
last
time
i
saw
you
it
wasn't
high
school
girls
don't
cha
like
remember
budapest
turn
of
the
century
you
were
such
a
bad
boy
during
that
earthquake
is
there
anything
better
than
a
natural
disaster
the
panic
the
people
lost
in
the
streets
it's
like
picking
fruit
off
the
vine
nice
you're
living
above
ground
like
one
of
them
you
and
your
new
friend
are
attacking
us
like
one
of
them
but
guess
what
precious
you're
not
one
of
them
are
you
is
that
what
you
tell
yourself
these
days
you're
not
exactly
living
off
quiche
you
and
i
both
know
what
you
hunger
for
what
you
need
hey
it's
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
it's
who
we
are
it's
what
makes
eternal
life
worth
living
mm
you
can
only
suppress
your
real
nature
for
so
long
you
can
feel
it
brewing
inside
of
you
i
hope
i'm
around
when
it
explodes
i'm
not
afraid
of
you
i
bet
she
is
though
or
maybe
i'm
underestimating
her
talk
to
her
tell
her
about
the
curse
maybe
she'll
come
around
and
if
she
still
doesn't
trust
you
you
know
where
i'll
be
don't
think
i'm
not
grateful
you
letting
me
kill
the
three
but
you've
gotta
let
me
take
care
of
the
slayer
okay
then
we'll
just
do
nothing
while
she
takes
us
out
one
by
one
angel
kills
her
and
comes
back
to
the
fold
so
do
i
to
keep
her
from
killing
him

with
the
war
of
independence

goes
back
to
those
days

very
nice
of
you
to
invite
me
into
your
home

home
she's
out
hunting
you
right
now
she
wants
to
kill
you
what
did
you
think

you
think
she
would
understand
that
she
would
look
at
your
face
your
true
face
and
give
you
a
kiss
for
a
hundred
years
you've
not
had
a
moment's
peace
because
you
will
not
accept
who
you
are
that's
all
you
have
to
do
accept
it
don't
let
her
hunt
you
down
don't
whimper
and
mewl
like
a
mangy
human
kill
feed
live
what
do
you
want
that's
good
you're
hurting
me
that's
good
too
sure
it
is
do
you
know
what
the
saddest
thing
in
the
world
is
to
love
someone
who
used
to
love
you
for
several
generations
i
made
him
there
was
a
time
when
we
shared
everything
wasn't
there
angelus
you
had
a
chance
to
come
home
to
rule
with
me
in
the
master's
court
for
a
thousand
years
but
you
threw
that
away
because
of
her
you
love
someone
who
hates
us
you're
sick
and
you'll
always
be
sick
and
you'll
always
remember
what
it
was
like
to
watch
her
die
you
don't
think
i
came
alone
do
you
hmm
scary
scarier
oh
don't
worry
bullets
can't
kill
vampires
can
hurt
them
like
hell
but
so
many
body
parts
so
few
bullets
let's
begin
with
the
kneecaps
no
fun
dancing
without
them
close
but
no
heart
c'mon
buffy
take
it
like
a
man
angel
