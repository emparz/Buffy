did
they
know
what
they
wanted

the
times
they
kissed
me

and
your
hands

i
held
in
mine
your
eyes

that
always
make
me
shiver

now
they
are
closed

they
just
sometimes
twitch
a
little
and
your
body

i
could
hold
for
an
hour

it
sent
me
to
heaven

with
its
heat
and
power
i'll
remember
you

you
will
be
there
in
my
heart

i'll
remember
you

and
that
is
all
that
i
can
do

but
i'll
remember
