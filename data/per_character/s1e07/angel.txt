come
in
unless
it's
invited

just
out
walking

a
long
while

pretty
when

to
sleep
hmm
i
don't
know
it's
been
a
long
time
since
anybody's
been
in
a
position
to
let
me
know
hey
uh
i
read
a
little
and
just
thought
about
a
lot
of
things
buffy
i
buffy
your
mother
moved
your
diary
when
she
came
in
to
straighten
up
i
watched
from
the
closet
i
didn't
read
it
i
swear
i
did
a
lot
of
thinking
today
i
really
can't
be
around
you
because
when
i
am
when
i
am
all
i
can
ever
think
about
is
how
badly
i
want
to
kiss
you
i'm
older
than
you
and
this
can't
ever
i
better
go
i
should
who's
here
a
lifetime
what's
with
the
catholic
schoolgirl
look
last
time
i
saw
you
it
was
kimonos
you
did
some
damage
yourself
no
but
i'm
not
exactly
one
of
you
either
maybe
you
don't
wanna
be
let
her
go
leave
me
alone
alright
i
want
it
finished
do
you
i'm
just
an
animal
right
let's
get
it
done
c'mon
don't
go
soft
on
me
now
little
wide
feels
good
doesn't
it
feels
simple
why
not
i
killed
mine
i
killed
their
friends
and
their
friend's
children
for
a
hundred
years
i
offered
ugly
death
to
everyone
i
met
and
i
did
it
with
a
song
in
my
heart
fed
on
a
girl
about
your
age
beautiful
dumb
as
a
post
but
a
favorite
among
her
clan
romany
gypsies
the
elders
conjured
the
perfect
punishment
for
me
they
restored
my
soul
when
you
become
a
vampire
the
demon
takes
your
body
but
it
doesn't
get
your
soul
that's
gone
no
conscience
no
remorse
it's
an
easy
way
to
live
you
have
no
idea
what
it's
like
to
have
done
the
things
i've
done
and
to
care
i
haven't
fed
on
a
living
human
being
since
that
day
i
didn't
bite
her
but
i
wanted
to
i
can
walk
like
a
man
but
i'm
not
one
i
wanted
to
kill
you
tonight
i
just
wanted
to
see
if
you
were
okay
and
your
mother
if
i
can
go
a
little
while
without
getting
shot
or
stabbed
i'll
be
alright
look
this
can't
i
just
gotta
i
gotta
walk
away
from
this
i
know
it's
just
