you
were
there
you
saw
dr
gregory
didn't
you
don't
say
dead
or
decapitated
or
decomposing
i'd
stay
away
from
dwords
altogether
but
you
witnessed
the
event
so
this
way
please
extremely
late
you
have
to
see
a
counselor
everyone
who
saw
the
body
has
to
see
a
crisis
counselor
we
all
need
help
with
our
feelings
otherwise
we
bottle
them
up
and
before
you
know
it
powerful
laxatives
are
involved
i
really
believe
if
we
all
reach
out
to
one
another
we
can
beat
this
thing
i'm
always
here
if
you
need
a
hug
but
not
a
real
hug
because
there's
no
touching
this
school
is
sensitive
to
wrong
touching
no
you
have
to
talk
to
a
counselor
and
start
the
healing
you
have
to
heal
heal
