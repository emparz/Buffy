i
cut
in
you
alright
finish
my
solo
and
kiss
you
like
you've
never
been
kissed
before
something
like
a
lobotomy
well
uh
are
we
talking
today
or
the
whole
week
ooo
duty
calls
babes
work
with
me
here
blayne
had
the
nerve
to
question
my
manliness
i'm
just
gonna
give
him
a
visual
i
know
and
after
all
my
conquests
who's
that
that
weird
guy
that
warned
her
about
all
the
vampires
well
he's
buff
she
never
said
anything
about
him
being
buff
he's
a
very
attractive
man
how
come
that
never
came
up
oh
right
give
her
your
jacket
it's
a
balmy
night
no
one
needs
to
be
trading
clothing
out
there
mornin'
guess
what
i
just
heard
in
the
office
no
dr
gregory
today
ergo
those
of
us
who
blew
off
our
science
homework
aren't
as
dumb
as
we
look
they
didn't
say
anything
about
sick
something
about
missing
well
let
me
think
um
the
cheerleaders
were
modeling
their
new
short
skirts
that
kinda
got
yeah
yeah
they
said
missing
which
is
bad
i'm
really
sorry
i'm
sure
he'll
i
uh
huh
uh
huh
huh
uuuuuuhhhhhh
yes
oh
it's
um
i
go
there
every
day
oh
god
where
is
it
it's
funny
how
the
earth
never
opens
up
and
swallows
you
when
you
want
it
to
i
wonder
what
she
sees
in
me
it's
probably
the
quiet
good
looks
coupled
with
a
certain
smoky
magnetism
miss
french
you
two're
probably
a
little
young
to
understand
what
an
older
woman
would
see
in
a
younger
man
good
what
surgical
improvements
hey
those
that
can
do
those
that
can't
laugh
at
those
who
can
do
guess
it's
what
they
call
a
rehearsal
i've
never
seen
i
mean
i've
never
seen
anything
like
that
was
new
this
is
a
question
that
no
one
particularly
wants
to
hear
but
where
did
they
put
his
head
so
why
would
he
come
after
a
teacher
so
there's
something
else
out
there
besides
silverwareman
oh
this
is
fun
we're
on
monster
island
hi
no
thanks
i
never
eat
when
i'm
making
egg
sacks
wow
if
this
were
real
the
bugs
would
be
yeah
so
where
do
we
start
oh
forgiveness
is
my
middle
name
well

it's
lavelle
and
i'd
appreciate
it
if
you
guard
that
secret
with
your
life
come
to
uh
your
place
yeah
ooo
yes
hey
well
it's
a
bit
demanding
being
her
absolute
favorite
guy
in
the
universe
but
i'll
muddle
through
i
know
she's
so
much
more
okay
i
see
so
if
she's
not
human
she's
it
doesn't
sound
weird
at
all
i
completely
understand
i've
met
someone
and
you're
jealous
look
there's
nothing
i
can
do
about
it
uh
there's
just
this
certain
chemical
thing
between
miss
french
and
me
she's
not
an
insect
she's
a
woman
okay
and
hard
as
that
may
be
for
you
to
conceive

actual
woman

me
attractive
