that's
all
he
said
fork
guy
i
think
there
are
too
many
guys
in
your
life
i'll
see
what
i
can
find
out
god
every
day
here
is
the
same
really
good
morning
here
drink
this
uh
he
didn't
have
any
enemies
on
the
staff
that
i'm
aware
of
he
was
a
civilized
man
i
liked
him
what
do
we
know
how
do
you
work
that
out
yes
yes
he
did
didn't
he
i
wish
i
knew
what
he
meant
i've
been
trying
to
gather
more
information
about
the
master
our
uh
local
vampire
king
there
was
one
oblique
reference
to
a
a
a
vampire
who
displeased
the
master
and
cut
his
hand
off
in
penance
i
don't
know
what
he
replaced
it
with
i'm
not
certain
he
did
there
was
an
incident
two
nights
ago
uh
involving
a
homeless
person
in
weatherly
park
he
was
practically
shredded
but
uh
nothing
like
dr
gregory
not
historically
well
unpleasant
things
do
gravitate
here
it's
true
but
uh
we
don't
know
there's
anything
besides
this
chap
he's
still
our
likely
suspect
buffy
i
know
you're
upset
but
uh
this
is
no
time
to
go
hunting
not
until
we
know
more
please
promise
me
you
won't
do
anything
rash
you
went
hunting
last
night
when
you
assured
me
you
wouldn't
did
you
see
someone
with
a
fork
oh
well
uh
at
least
you're
not
hurt
oh
yes
yes
she's
lovely
in
a
a
common
extremely
well
proportioned
way
he
what
ran
away
of
miss
french
not
many
and
not
substitute
teachers
as
a
rule
i
think
perhaps
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
we
kept
an
eye
on
her
um
i've
not
found
any
creature
as
yet
that
strikes
terror
in
a
vampire's
heart
nothing
human
can
do
that
what
are
you
going
to
do
and
she
is
by
and
large
woman
shaped
if
you're
right
then
she'd
have
to
be
a
shapeshifter
or
a
perception
distorter
on
a
helpful
note
i
had
a
chum
at
oxford
carlyle
advanced
degrees
in
entomology
mythology
bugs
and
fairy
tales
if
i
recall
correctly
poor
old
carlyle
just
before
he
went
mad
claimed
there
was
some
beast
the
boy
who
worked
with
miss
french
yesterday
oh
uh
yeah
i
just
need
to
make
one
transatlantic
telephone
call
um
this
computer
invasion
that
willow's
performing
on
the
coroner's
office
one
one
assumes
it
is
entirely
legal
right
wasn't
here
didn't
see
it
couldn't
have
stopped
you
frankly
madam
i
haven't
the
faintest
idea
what
time
it
is
nor
do
i
care
now
unlock
his
cell
unstrap
him
and
bring
him
to
the
telephone
immediately
this
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
ii
understand
carlyle
yes
ii'll
take
every
precaution
uh
absolutely
iiit
sounds
exactly
like
the
creature
you
described
yyou
were
right
all
along
about
everything
well
nno
you
weren't
right
about
your
mother
coming
back
as
a
pekinese
but
uh
try
to
rest
old
man
yes
ta
bye
now
dr
ferris
carlyle
spent
years
transcribing
a
lost
pregermanic
language
what
he
discovered
he
kept
to
himself
until
several
teenage
boys
were
murdered
in
the
cotswolds
then
he
went
hunting
for
it
uh
he
calls
her
a
shemantis
this
type
of
creature
the
kleptesvirgo
or
or
virginthief
appears
in
in
many
cultures
the
greek
sirens
the
celtic
sea
maidens
who
who
tore
the
living
flesh
from
the
bones
of
um
uh
well
basically
the
uh
the
shemantis
assumes
the
form
of
a
beautiful
woman
and
then
lures
innocent
virgins
back
to
her
nest
uh
carlyle
recommends
cleaving
all
body
parts
with
a
sharp
blade
well
whatever
you
do
it
had
better
be
certain
and
swift
this
beast
is
extremely
dangerous
yes
in
a
straitjacket
howling
his
innards
out
day
and
night
sorry
bat
sonar
right
what
where
am
i
gonna
find
the
recording
bat
sonar
is
something
soothingly
akin
to
having
one's
teeth
drilled
and
extremely
wellpreserved
what
now
exactly
we
can't
just
kick
the
door
down
abject
prayer
and
supplication
would
spring
to
mind
w
buffy
iit's
the
wrong
side
