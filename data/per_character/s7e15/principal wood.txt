is
that
so
because
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
a
couple
of
chuckleheads
who
thought
that
a
cafeteria
fist
fight
would
impress
i'm
not
impressed
buffy
are
you
impressed
still
i'm
gonna
cut
you
guys
some
slack
this
time
third
fight
this
week
and
it's
just
getting
worse
plus
a
rise
in
vandalism
three
students
missing
tell
me
something
buffy
in
your
professional
opinion—
it's
started
hasn't
it
was
it
like
this
before
i
mean
it
just
seems
to
me
as
if
things
are
getting
bad
faster
than
we
thought
i
can't
say
i'm
too
surprised
i
knew
i
signed
on
for
something
but
buffy
i'm
just
a
guy
granted
a
cool
and
sexy
vampirefighting
guy
but
still
mm
thank
you
but
this
is
gonna
get
bigger
than
me
that's
why
i've
decided
to
give
you
this
an
emergency
kit
this
bag
belonged
to
my
mother
well
you
have
to
technically
it
should
have
been
passed
down
directly
to
you
through
the
years
but
after
my
mother
died
i
guess
i
just
couldn't
part
with
it
i
don't
know
what's
inside
exactly
but
i
know
it
has
something
to
do
with
her
power
well
your
power
now
try
saying
thank
you
principal
wood
ah
call
me
robin
now
i'd
like
to
see
where
you
work
no
where
you
do
your
other
work
by
the
first
well
there's
nothing
like
the
end
of
the
world
to
bring
people
together
yeah
i
hear
they're
tricky
it's
a
pleasure
so
you—you
hold
him
here
against
his
will
oh
oh
i
wouldn't
have
guessed
so
i
see
looking
strong
well
i'm
just
not
sure
the
first
has
an
ass
that
you
can
actually
you
know
kick
that's
not
what
i
said
buffy
it's
an
impressive
group
of
recruits
you're
doing
the
best
you
can
with
what
you've
got
buffy
tells
me
you
have
been
um—oh
how
shall
i
put
it—experimenting
with
the
magicks
she
really
almost
destroyed
the
world
remind
me
not
to
make
her
crabby
how's
that
work
hm
well
you're
redefining
the
job
buffy
and
that
takes
guts
this
isn't
your
full
arsenal
anyway
show
me
the
vampire
i
hope
we're
not
intruding
is
that
what
you
are
a
good
guy
no
he's
not
why
don't
you
tell
me
about
that
oh
now
that
you
have
a
soul
oh
come
on
spike
don't
blame
buffy
i
asked
and
how's
that
working
out
for
you
well
you've
had
some
time
you've
been
in
sunnydale
what
how
many
before
that
yeah
you
thought
right
mm
i
don't
know
it
hasn't
been
opened
since—
well
since
now
you
saw
the
first
slayer
buffy
you
don't
even
know
what
you're
exchanging
you
don't
know
if
you're
ready
yet
yeah
demon
loose
no
slayer
if
we
play
it
safe
back
here
buffy
could
stay
lost
right
if
we
want
buffy
back
then
we
have
to
find
that
demon
and
send
it
through
where
are
you
going
where
you
going
nice
coat
where'd
you
get
it
