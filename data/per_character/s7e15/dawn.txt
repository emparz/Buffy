so
i
took
a
look
inside
that
emergency
bag
of
principal
wood's
smelled
weird
kinda
like
grandma's
closet
but
worse
trinkets
weapons
one
very
large
textbook
translation's
gonna
be
a
bitch
but
do
you
know
that
ancient
sumerians
do
not
speak
english
uh
yeah
a
box
a
big
fat
unopenable
box
i'm
betting
whatever
the
big
deal
about
this
emergency
bag
is
you'll
find
it
in
the
box
oh
you
mean
like
schoolwork
well
i've
got
a
system
it's
called
flunking
out
no
just
kidding
i'm
paying
someone
to
do
my
work
i'm
kidding
i
love
to
see
your
eyeballs
change
color
when
you
think
i'm
gonna
flunk
out
of—
what
are
you
gonna
do
that
emergency
bag's
got
some
neat
stuff
in
it
weapons
charms
advanced
reading
assignments
and
these
things
are
shadowcasters
you
put
them
in
motion
and
they
tell
you
a
story
it
says
you
can't
just
watch
you
have
to
see
that's
where
all
my
fancy
translating
skills
break
down
but
i
think
it's
an
origin
myth
the
story
of
the
very
first
slayer
ok
according
to
this
i
think—you
put
on
those
puppet
guys
one
by
one
they
cast
shadows
and
the
shadows
tell
the
story
first
there
is
the
earth
hmm
ok
then
there
came
the
demons
after
demons
there
came
men
men
found
a
girl
and
the
men
took
the
girl
to
fight
the
demon—all
demons
they—they
chained
her
to
the
earth
and
then—and
i—i
can't
read
this
something
about
darkness
it
says
you
cannot
be
shown
you
cannot
just
watch
but
you
must
see
see
for
yourself
but
only
if
you're
willing
to
make
the
exchange
it's
not
in
sumerian
anymore
are
you
injured
i'll
go
check
on
him
not
much
once
buffy
left
it
got
a
little
tougher
to
read
willow
how
would
you
get
buffy
back
ok
but
if
another
witch
was
to
do
it
where
would
she
start
such
as
i'm
sorry
are
you
helping
ok
good
the
sand
forms
a
circle
the
circle
acts
as
a
barrier
and
the
barrier
contains
the
portal
