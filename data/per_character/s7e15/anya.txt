i'm
a
bright
girl
good
education
quick
on
the
uptake
so
tell
me
why
in
the
name
of
almighty
grothnar
would
i
let
myself
become
human
again
i
mean
sure
the
vengeance
demon
gig
has
some
downsides
but
being
human
ugh
you're
always
icky
on
the
inside
disgusting
on
the
outside
you
know
the
only
thing
worse
than
being
human
is
being
trapped
inside
a
house
full
of
humans
i
mean
it's
like
we
live
in
slayer
central
i
swear
if
buffy
rooms
or
boards
one
more
of
the
potential
girls
i'm
gonna
call
aâ€”i'm
gonna
call
a
health
inspector
thanks
for
having
me
along
at
first
i
thought
it's
weird
is
spike
asking
me
out
on
a
date
'cause
that
would
just
be
nuts
right
there
with
you
scooter
tonight
i
plan
to
drink
you
under
the
table
good
of
course
once
you're
down
there
i
could
join
you
kidding
i
like
my
sex
on
top
of
the
table
so
what
ok
ok
i
wasn't
proposing
time
goes
by
girl
gets
hungry
you
should
know
what
huh
oh
hey
but
you
just
let
him
go
for
now
that
was
one
of
d'hoffryn's
killers
spike
he
won't
stop
coming
'til
he
kills
me
but
you
fought
like
such
a
wimpire
what
with
the
lifting
and
the
running
why
not
just
kill
him
i'm
not
i
provide
muchneeded
sarcasm
well
not
this
we
haven't
what's
inside
it
what
the
hell
does
that
mean
what
was
that
about
an
exchange
except
maybe
spike
we've
got
bigger
problems
than
that
which
spell
i
mean
didn't
you
see
that
thing
and
you
expect
to
reopen
the
portal
without
sending
willow
off
the
deep
end
well
it's
true
we're
going
to
have
to
find
another
way
she's
right
and
you
know
we
have
a
choice
we
can
risk
willow's
life
and
the
rest
of
our
lives
to
get
buffy
back
or
we
leave
her
out
there
you
missed
her
everyone
sucks
but
me
speech
if
she's
so
superior
let
her
find
her
own
way
back
no
but
at
least
i'm
not
galloping
off
in
the
wrong
direction
not
without
a
catalyst
if
you're
talking
about
transferring
energies
you
need
some
kind
of
conduit
yeah
skin
of
draconis
um
ground
up
baltic
stones
something
