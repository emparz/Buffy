good
thinking
but
on
the
other
hand
why
rush
up
or
down
i'll
still
be
dead
yeah
well
neither
is
she
anymore
now
she's
just
chloe's
body
nothing
we
just
talked
all
night
well
i
did
most
of
the
talking
but
chloe
isi'm
sorry
was
a
good
listener
'til
she
hanged
herself
like
when
you
called
her
maggot—she
really
heard
that
oh
let
'em
the
only
reason
why
chloe
offed
herself
is
'cause
she
knew
what
you're
not
getting
i'm
coming
you're
going
all
this—it's
almost
over
all
of
you
but
wait
i
thought—
they're
not
all
gonna
make
it
some
will
die
and
there's
nothing
i
can
do
that
will
stop
it
hey
i
didn't
say
it
but
i'll
be
seeing
all
of
you
one
by
one
ttfn
