miss
summers
the
watcher's
council
does
not
keep
track
of
our
lapsed
employees
ever
since
mr
giles
pulled
up
his
stake
in
sunnydale
we've
not
made
it
our
business
to
follow
his
every
move
well
i
suppose
if
you
feel
the
matter's
urgent
we
can
look
into
it
not
at
all
good
day
the
girl
knows
nothing
and
we
need
to
find
rupert
giles
as
soon
as
possible
it's
all
right
lydia
we
are
still
masters
of
our
fate
still
captains
of
our
souls
ladies
and
gentlemen
our
fears
have
been
confirmed
the
first
evil
has
declared
allout
war
on
this
institution
their
first
volleys
proved
most
effective
i
for
one
think
it's
time
we
struck
back
give
me
confirmations
on
all
remaining
operatives
visuals
and
tacticals
highest
alert
get
them
here
as
soon
as
possible
begin
preparations
for
mobilization
once
we're
accounted
for
i
want
to
be
ready
to
move
we'll
be
paying
a
visit
to
the
hell
mouth
my
friends
these
are
the
times
that
define
us
proverbs
246
o
by
wise
council
you
shall
make
your
war
