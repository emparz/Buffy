now
guys
look
we
can
settle
this
one
of
two
ways
you
can
repaint
the
walls
or
i
can
suspend
you
and
report
this
little
incident
on
your
permanent
record
ok
i
was
bluffing
i
hadn't
really
thought
that
one
through
listen
this
whole
permanent
record
thing
is
such
a
myth
anyway
colleges
never
ask
for
anything
past
your
sat
scores
and
it's
not
like
employers
are
gonna
be
calling
up
to
check
to
see
how
many
days
you
missed
back
in
high
school
so
listen
ii
could
suspend
you
but
that
would
mean
calling
your
parents
alerting
your
teachers
filling
out
paperwork
and
quite
possibly
having
to
talk
to
the
school
board
all
of
which
sounds
positively
exhausting
to
me
no
no
i
think
it
would
be
much
easier
if
i
just
called
the
police
let
them
deal
with
it
oh
and
in
case
you're
wondering
this
is
the
part
where
i'm
not
bluffing
good
job
excuse
me
miss
summers
i'm
with
students
oh
no
yeah
we
got
that
stomach
flu
going
around
thank
you
that's
very
helpful
um
tell
your
sister
not
to
worry
about
it
we'll
soldier
on
without
her
here
just
um
tell
her
to
concentrate
on
getting
better
