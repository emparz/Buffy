you'll
have
to
excuse
the
spectacle
but
i've
always
been
a
bit
of
a
sucker
for
the
old
classics
oh
don't
look
at
me
that
way
i
wanted
to
do
this
more
subtlelike
my
harbingers
have
a
tendency
to
call
attention
to
themselves
you're
the
one
who
couldn't
hold
his
end
of
the
bargain
you're
the
one
who
couldn't
take
care
of
what'shisname
you're
the
one
who
had
to
make
breakthroughs
and
learn
something
about
himself
so
now
fittingly
you're
the
one
who
gets
to
do
the
honors
