i've
got
a
house
to
put
back
together
oh
this
can't
be
good
what're
you
doing
back
in
town
we'll
see
about
that
now
we
can
do
this
the
hard
way
if
you
want
but
believe
me
if
i
tell
you
this
will
go
much
easier
if
you
just
tell
us
what
you
know
here's
the
thing
i
don't
believe
you
well
then
you
won't
mind
if
we
ask
you
a
few
questions
why
were
you
buying
blood
at
the
butcher
shop
hey
anya
hey
anya
can
i
talk
to
you
outside
for
a
second
you
were
perfect
i
was
worried
i
overdid
it
with
the
whole
easy
way
hard
way
thing
he'll
be
singing
in
no
time
now
we
let
him
stew
in
his
own
juices
for
a
bit
then
we
give
him
the
hard
brace
he's
primed
i'll
be
pumping
him
in
no
time
he'll
give
us
information
soon
how's
your
face
you
don't
know
the
half
of
it
she's
a
vengeance
demon
you
know
she's
bad
news
she's
killed
more
men
than
smallpox
she's
killed
a
lot
of
men
she
tortures
them
anyone
who
incurs
her
wrath
one
time
she—
no
never
mind
it's
not
important
well
there
was
this
one
guy—there
was
this
one
guy
he
uh
he
hurt
her
real
bad
so
she
paid
him
back
she
killed
him
but
she
did
it
real
slow
see
first
she
stopped
his
heart
then
she
replaced
it
with
darkness
then
she
made
him
live
his
life
like
that
but
he
still
had
to
go
do
his
job
and
see
his
friends
and
wake
up
in
the
morning
and
go
to
bed
at
night
but
he
had
to
do
it
all
empty
without
anything
to
look
forward
to
ever
well
then
she
tore
out
his
intestines
and
rubbed
it
in
his
face
and
took
pictures
of
it
but
she's
downstairs
now
don't
worry
about
her
see
the
thing
is
we've
all
been
a
little
on
edge
lately
some
bad
things
have
been
happening
and
the
girls—they're
all
looking
for
someone
to
blame
anya
no
he's
got
a
good
chunk
taken
out
of
his
neck
but
he'll
be
all
right
had
to
tie
him
up
again
but
mainly
just
to
keep
him
from
scratching
at
his
bandages
what
the
hell
happened
up
there
trigger
no
in
his
head
it's
a
trigger
it's
a
brainwashing
term
it's
how
the
military
makes
sleeper
agents
theythey
brainwash
operatives
and
condition
them
with
a
specific
trigger
like
a
song
that
makes
'em
drastically
change
at
a
moment's
notice
no
this
is
left
over
from
every
army
movie
i've
ever
seen
but
it
makes
sense
we've
had
ghosts
or
something
haunting
us
right
well
what
if
spike's
ghosts
have
figured
out
a
way
to—not
only
haunt
him—what
if
they
figured
out
how
to—how
to
control
him
well
usually
the
operative
completes
his
task
and
either
blows
his
head
off
or
steals
a
submarine
buffy
she's
ok
is
this
it
i
thought
there
was
more
of
them
they
were
so
fast
and
organized
and
we
were
just
in
the
way
