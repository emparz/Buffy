we're
gonna
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
we
just
can't
take
any
chances
i
need
to
find
him
as
soon
as
possible
he's
not
answering
any
of
his
numbers
you
don't
have
to
get
all
british
and
dodgy
mr
travers
i
know
you
have
ways
of
finding
him
i'd
appreciate
it
thank
you
can
i
do
something
here
he's
been
feasting
on
humans
for
weeks
he's
having
some
pretty
bad
withdrawls
i
think
we
need
to
get
him
some
blood
no
we
should
probably
try
to
wean
him
off
humans
he'll
have
to
make
do
with
animal
blood
you
don't
mind
thank
you
he's
in
pretty
bad
shape
past
the
point
where
he
can
tell
me
anything
i'll
be
ok
he's
not
talking
yet
we'll
get
there
how's
your
guy
better
good
well
you
were
having
pretty
bad
withdrawal
nothing
when
did
your
chip
stop
working
and
the
losing
time
how
long
has
that
been
going
on
you
got
your
soul
how
did
you
do
it
how'd
you
get
your
soul
back
just
like
that
of
sorts
meaning
how
can
you
say
that
so
that's
what
this
is
about
you
feeling
sorry
for
yourself
spike
yes
you
figured
that
out
just
now
violence
william
the
bloody
now
has
insight
into
violence
excuse
me
everything
ok
ok

who
were
you
talking
to
i
heard
you
through
the
door
who
were
you
talking
to
are
you
ok
spike
he
didn't
seem
to
want
anything
to
do
with
me
i
mean
he
just
pushed
me
aside
and
charged
at
the
wall
not—not
really
ii
don't
know
spike
and
i
were
having
a
conversation
and
he
was
fine
i
mean
you
know
fine
as
spike
can
be
and
then
i
went
to
check
on
you
guys
and
when
i
got
back
it
was
like
he
was
a
completely
different
person
he
was
talking
to
someone
i
heard
through
the
door
he
was
having
this
conversation
and
then
he
started
singing
he—he
mentioned
something
about
a
song
in
the
cellar
uh
aand
he
changed
there
too—i
mean
instantly
became
another
person
spike
said
he's
been
seeing
things
since
i
found
him
in
the
basement
this
trigger
how
do
we
holster—safety
or—i
don't
know
guns
how
do
we
make
it
stop
all
right
i
need
information
if
spike's
a
bomb
then
i
need
to
know
how
to
diffuse
him
you
two
i
wanna
know
what
did
this
to
him
spirits
ghosts
demons—check
the
lot
of
them
look
for
anything
that
could
haunt
oror
possibly
control
like
this
i
need
to
know
exactly
what
we're
dealing
with
you
took
a
good
bite
out
of
andrew
tucker's
brother
he'll
be
ok
it's
ok
we
think
we
do
something's
playing
you
some
ghost
or
demon
has
figured
out
how
to
control
you
got
the
gang
researching
it
right
now
xander
has
this
theory
that
you're
being
triggered
what
you
don't
understand
when
i
left
the
room
earlier
i
heard
you
talking
to
someone—
i
was
in
the
cellar
with
you
i
saw
what
you
did
believe
me
i'm
well
aware
of
what
you're
capable
of
it's
not
your
fault
you're
not
the
one
doing
this
we
can
keep
you
locked
up
keep
you
here
and
we'll
figure
out—
you
fought
by
my
side
you've
saved
lives
you've
helped—
no
no
i
don't
hate
like
that
not
you
or
myself
not
anymore
you
think
you
have
insight
now
because
your
soul's
drenched
in
blood
you
don't
know
me
you
don't
even
know
you
was
that
you
who
killed
those
people
in
the
cellar
was
that
you
who
waited
for
those
girls
that's
not
true
listen
to
me
you're
not
alive
because
of
hate
or
pain
you're
alive
because
i
saw
you
change
because
i
saw
your
penance
be
easier
wouldn't
it
it
if
were
an
act
but
it's
not
you
faced
the
monster
inside
of
you
and
you
fought
back
you
risked
everything
to
be
a
better
man
and
you
can
be
you
are
you
may
not
see
it
but
i
do
i
do
i
believe
in
you
spike
dawn
spike
they
were
after
spike
all
along
i
know
these
guys
i
fought
them
before
we
aren't
being
haunted
this
isn't
some
demon
it's
all
the
same
thing
spike's
ghosts
the
people
you
guys
saw
from
beneath
us
it's
all
the
same
thing
i
know
what
we're
up
against
the
first
