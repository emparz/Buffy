you're
probably
wondering
what
i'm
doing
with
this
stuff
huh
uh
for
history
class
mr
giles
has
this
like
hobby
of
collecting
stuff
which
he
lent
me
for
show
and
tell
ddid
i
mention
it's
for
history
class
well
ii
don't
even
like
chocolates
okay
that
was
the
lamest
comeback
of
our
times
bribery
she's
desperate
to
be
may
queen
gee
it's
fun
that
we're
speaking
in
tongues
i
was
at
my
old
school
well
we
didn't
call
it
'may
queen'
but
we
had
the
coronation
and
the
dance
and
all
that
stuff
it
was
nice
mitch
what
happened
what
hit
you
i'd
better
check
out
the
scene
um
mitch
wanted
me
to
get
his
comb
he
he
likes
his
comb
maybe
all
i
know
is
it's
a
message
and
monsters
don't
usually
send
messages
it's
pretty
much
crush
kill
destroy
this
was
different
i
love
it
when
he
says
that
any
theories
yeah
i'd
say
the
locker
room
was
a
real
scene
i
guess
so
you
know
why
don't
you
compile
a
list
of
dead
or
missing
kids
it's
probably
a
good
place
to
start
it's
all
part
of
the
glamorous
world
of
vampire
slayage
gonna
find
out
what
i
can
about
mitch
this
attack
wasn't
random
fine
you
can
do
it
ask
around
talk
to
his
friends
talk
to
cordelia
cordelia
can
i
talk
to
you
what
happened
is
anybody
here
hey
who's
here
okay
i
know
someone's
here
look
i'm
not
gonna
hurt
you
i
just
wanna
talk
to
you
giles
have
you
ever
touched
a
ghost
you
see
that's
my
problem
i
touched
the
thing
but
it
didn't
go
through
me
it
bumped
into
me
and
it
wasn't
cold
a
girl
she
laughed
this
girl's
sorta
petty
for
a
god
cordelia
first
thing
tomorrow
why
don't
you
pull
up
that
missing
kids
list
bye
i
think
cordelia's
gonna
be
workin'
on
her
may
queen
dress
tonight
maybe
there'll
be
some
action
guess
i'm
gonna
start
the
hunt
very
funny
last
night
was
a
bust
but
i
still
think
cordy's
the
key
good
work
hey
you
guys
check
out
this
one
it's
the
most
recent
one
marcie
ross
disappeared
like
six
months
ago
her
only
activity
was
band
she
played
the
flute
well
last
night
when
i
was
hunting
i
heard
this
flute
but
i
couldn't
figure
out
where
it
was
coming
from
and
it
was
in
the
band
room
that
i
lost
miss
invisible
yesterday
you
know
what
this
all
tracks
i'm
gonna
check
it
out
see
you
guys
later
marcie
ross
so
it
is
you
it
looked
like
she'd
been
there
for
months
it's
where
i
found
this
'have
a
nice
summer'
is
what
you
write
when
you
have
nothing
to
say
you
guys
didn't
know
marcie
ross
'cause
you
both
wrote
it
too
you
guys
don't
remember
her
so
no
one
noticed
her
and
now
she's
invisible
i
think
i
speak
for
everyone
here
when
i
say
huh
and
with
the
hellmouth
below
us
sending
out
mystical
energy
this
isn't
this
great
power
that
she
can
control
it's
something
that
was
done
to
her
that
we
did
to
her
just
what
we
thought
cordelia
so
you've
come
to
me
for
help
okay
cordelia
your
attacker
is
an
invisible
girl
well
it's
not
that
simple
it's
a
person
it's
it's
this
person
now
do
you
have
any
idea
why
she'd
be
so
i
don't
think
we're
supposed
to
yet
marcie's
not
quite
ready
but
from
what
she
did
to
cordelia's
picture
i
would
say
that
she's
wigged
on
the
whole
may
queen
thing
maybe
she's
gonna
do
something
about
it
cordelia
has
a
point
anyway
continuing
the
normal
may
queen
activities
may
be
the
best
way
to
draw
marcie
out
we
can
use
cordelia
as
bait
a
sitting
duck
c'mon
that
about
sums
it
up
hmm
so
you've
read
something
about
the
feeling
well
if
you
feel
so
alone
then
why
do
you
work
so
hard
at
being
popular
your
secret
dies
with
me
looks
okay
but
hurry
you
know
what
you
were
saying
before
i
understand
somehow
it
doesn't
seem
to
matter
how
popular
you
are
when
in
la
ththe
point
is
i
did
sort
of
feel
like
something
was
missing
okay
can
we
have
the
heartfelt
talk
with
a
little
less
talk
from
you
cordelia
cordelia
cordelia
cordelia
cordelia
oh
my
god
yeah
what
do
you
mean
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
well
why
don't
you
explain
it
c'mon
marcie
what
are
we
supposed
to
learn
marcie
you
can't
do
this
marcie
you
know
this
is
wrong
hold
still
y'know
i
really
felt
sorry
for
you
you've
suffered
there's
one
thing
i
really
didn't
factor
into
all
this
you're
a
thundering
loony
cordelia
shut
up
i
see
you
she
punches
marcie
again
knocking
her
down
once
more
the
side
door
opens
and
several
fbi
men
come
in
take
what
from
where
well
where
were
you
ten
minutes
ago
when
she
was
playing
surgeon
you
can
cure
her
this
isn't
the
first
time
this
has
happened
is
it
it's
happened
at
other
schools
do
you
know
that
you
guys
are
very
creepy
i
just
can't
believe
how
twisted
marcie
got
by
the
way
how
did
you
guys
get
out
of
the
boiler
room
i'll
say
hey
it's
okay
