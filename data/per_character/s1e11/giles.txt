ah
here
you
are
i'd
have
to
say
you're
right
uh
i'm
uh
it's
a
bit
of
a
puzzle
really
um
i've
never
actually
heard
of
anyone
attacked
by
a
lone
baseball
bat
before
well
assuming
the
bat
itself
is
not
possessed
uh
there
are
a
few
possibilities
that
bear
investigating
uh
someone
with
telekinesis
uh
the
power
to
move
objects
at
will
uh
uh
an
invisible
creature
um
or
possibly
a
poltergeist
yes
and
a
very
angry
one
and
uh
i'll
research
all
the
possibilities
ghosts
included
but
uh
xander
if
you're
not
doing
anything
would
you
like
to
help
me
uh
no
from
what
i've
heard
uh
having
a
a
ghost
pass
through
you
is
a
singular
experience
it's
a
it's
a
rather
uh
cold
amorphous
feeling
it
makes
your
hair
stand
on
end
a
girl
on
campus
with
the
ability
to
become
invisible
it
must
be
a
fairly
heady
experience
having
that
ability
so
i'll
look
into
ways
that
you
can
decloak
an
invisible
someone
what
about
you
how
exactly
do
you
propose
to
hunt
someone
you
can't
see
you
may
have
to
work
on
listening
to
people
i
thought
so
who's
there
a
vampire
casts
no
reflection
buffy
told
me
you
don't
feed
from
humans
anymore
is
that
why
you're
here
to
see
her
a
vampire
in
love
with
a
slayer
it's
rather
poetic
in
a
maudlin
sort
of
way
what
can
i
uh
what
can
i
do
for
you
yes
the
vampire
king
i've
tried
to
learn
as
much
as
i
can
about
him
for
the
day
that
buffy
must
face
him
ii've
studied
all
the
extant
volumes
of
course
but
the
uh
most
salient
books
of
slayer
prophecy
have
been
lost
the
tiberius
manifesto
the
pergamum
codex
it's
reputed
to
have
contained
the
most
complete
prophecies
about
the
slayer's
role
in
the
end
years
unfortunately
the
book
was
lost
in
the
15th
century
that
would
be
most
helpful
uh
mmy
own
volumes
have
been
rather
useless
of
late
there's
an
invisible
girl
terrorizing
the
school
nor
mine
i'm
afraid
uh
it's
fascinating
though
by
all
accounts
it's
a
a
a
wonderful
power
to
possess
a
nest
uh
once
again
i
teeter
at
the
precipice
of
the
generation
gap
of
course
i've
been
investigating
the
mystical
causes
of
invisibility
when
i
i
should
have
looked
at
the
quantum
mechanical
physics
it's
a
rudimentary
concept
that
that
reality
is
shaped
even
even
created
by
our
perception
people
perceived
marcie
as
as
as
invisible
and
and
and
and
she
became
so
please
sit
down
you
know
i
i
don't
recall
ever
seeing
you
here
before
according
to
what
you
told
us
about
the
attack
on
ms
miller
we
now
have
two
messages
from
marcie
'look'
and
'listen'
willow
xander
you'll
help
me
begin
our
research
anew
unless
we
find
a
way
to
cure
marcie's
invisibility
then
buffy
will
be
come
on
we
could
talk
to
her
perhaps
reason
with
her
or
possibly
grab
her
marcie
we
know
what
happened
to
you
please
can
we
talk
to
you
what's
that
sound
it's
gas
she's
snuffed
out
the
pilot
light
the
gas
is
on
full
i
can't
find
the
shutoff
valve
no
one
spark
and
you'll
take
the
whole
building
with
us
that
should
give
us
a
few
minutes
but
we
b
if
we
don't
get
out
of
this
room
soon
the
loneliness
the
constant
exile
she's
she
has
gone
mad
one
two
three
again
yes
wwwell
shut
it
off
otherwise
uh
the
whole
building
will
go
up
come
on
let's
get
out
of
here
janitor
um
found
us
shut
the
valve
off
