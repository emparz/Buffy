right
but
my
responsibility

take
it
very
seriously
it

the
spring
fling
ms
miller
oh
my
god
ms
miller
oh
my
god
are
you
okay
ms
miller
what

necessarily
mean
he's
the
hero
right
what
i
knew
you'd
be
here
buffy
i
uh
i
i
know
we've
had
our
differences
with
you
being
so
weird
and
all
and
hanging
out
with
these
total
losers
ooo
well
anyway
despite
all
of
that
i
know
that
you
share
this
feeling
that
we
have
for
each
other
deep
down
somebody
is
after
me
they
just
tried
to
kill
ms
miller
uh
she
was
helping
me
with
my
homework
and
mitch
and
harmony
this
is
all
about
me
me
me
me
because
you're
always
around
when
all
this
weird
stuff
is
happening
and
i
know
you're
very
strong
and
you've
got
all
those
weapons
i
was
kind
of
hoping
you
were
in
a
gang
please
i
don't
have
anyone
else
to
turn
to
okay
thanks
oh
no
i
have
a
life
well
i
don't
care
what
it
is
just
get
rid
of
it
oh

she
really
wearing
laura
ashley
i
have
no
idea
i've
never
seen
this
girl
before
in
my
life
nothing
is
keeping
me
from
the
bronze
tonight
if
i'm
not
crowned

then
then
marcie's
won
and
that
would
be
bad
she's
evil
okay

eviler
than
me
buffy's
with
me
on
this
great
bait
well
i
have
to
try
on
my
dress

i
really
bait

how
much
the
creepy
is
it
that
this
marcie's
been
at
this
for
months
spying
on
us
learning
our
most
guarded
secrets
so
are
you
saying
she's
invisible
because
she's
so
unpopular
bummer
for
her
it's
awful
to
feel
that
lonely
hey
you
think
i'm
never
lonely
because
i'm
so
cute
and
popular
i
can
be
surrounded
by
people
and
be
completely
alone
it's
not
like
any
of
them
really
know
me
i
don't
even
know
if
they
like
me
half
the
time
people
just
want
to
be
in
a
popular
zone
sometimes
when
i
talk
everyone's
so
busy
agreeing
with
me
they
don't
hear
a
word
i
say
well
it
beats
being
alone
all
by
yourself
if
you
ever
tell
to
anyone
that
i
changed
in
a
mop
closet
okay
you
were
popular
in
what
alternate
universe
is
that
when
you
became
weird
and
got
kicked
out

can't
feel
my
face
