i
demand
an
explanation
wesley
so
very
funny
any
minute
i
am
sure
to
laugh
i
just
got
off
the
phone
with
him
he
could
hardly
speak
he
was
so
upset
he
said
there
was
something
about
a
fight
and
he
is
leaving
the
country
just
tell
me
what's
going
on
but
he
is
her
watcher
well
does
he
have
to
leave
the
country
i
mean
you
got
fired
and
you
still
hang
around
like
a
big
loser
why
can't
he
sure

this
is
just
such
a
buffy
thing
to
do
she
is
always
thinking
of
herself
i
personally
don't
think
it's
impossible
to
come
up
with
a
crazier
plan
i
stand
corrected
thank
you

my
point
however
is
crazy
or
not
it's
pretty
much
the
only
plan

besides
it's
buffy's

and
she's
slay
gal

you
know
ms
little
likestofight
so
of
course
that's
it
we
attack
him
with
germs
no
no
we'll
get
a
box
with
the
ebola
virus
and…
and…
or
it
doesn't
even
have
to
be
real
we
can
just
get
a
box
that
says
ebola
on
it
and…
uhm
chase
him…
with
the
box…
that
is
so
classy
isn't
he
just
so
classy
yes
yes
i
know
i
guess
not
no
needed
wanted…
good
luck
in
england
that'll
be
neat
well
that’s
the
most
fun
you
can
have
without
having
any
fun
i'm
for
it
