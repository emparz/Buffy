not
yet
thank
you
horrible
tea
is
soothing
i
wish
to
be
tense
look
through
the
ah…
kepler
volumes
any
reference
to
the
demon
olvukan
powers
weaknesses
hat
size
anything
there's
got
to
be
something
should
i
assay
remorse
buffy
has
quit
the
council
she'll
not
be
working
with
wesley
from
now
on
buffy
no
longer
needs
a
watcher
how
is
she
you
fed
off
her
how
much
you
better
go
angel
we'll
watch
over
her
the
sun
will
be
up
soon
let's
go
find
out
how
buffy's
doing
how
do
you
feel
buffy
are
you
sure
you're
all
right
let's
not
rule
it
out
though
i
didn't
say
that
i
might

but
not
yet
um
buffy
all
of
this
is
rather
depended
on
your
being
able
to
control
the
mayor
his
weakness
which
is…
well
let's…
let's…ah
let's
think
ah
i
suppose
it
should
be
i
it's
strangely
fitting
in
a
grotesque
fashion
ah
what
about
you
are
you
all
right
i
should
imagine
so
it's
been
quite
a
couple
of
days
understandable
well
when
it's
working
again
congratulate
it
on
a
good
campaign
you
did
very
well
i
ah…
i
managed
to
ferret
this
out
of
the
wreckage
now
it
may
not
interest
you
but…
i'd
say
you
earned
it
there
is
a
certain
dramatic
irony
that's
attached
to
all
this
a
synchronicity
that
borders
on…
on
predestination
one
might
say
yes
s…sorry
i'm
going
to
see
to
wesley
see
if
he's…
is
still…
whimpering
