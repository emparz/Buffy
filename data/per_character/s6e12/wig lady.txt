i'd
like
a
small
coffee
and
cherry
pie
i
come
here
every
day
oh
you
really
might
make
it
dear
not
like
some
of
them
where
suddenly
you
never
see
them
again
i
can
see
you
here
a
long
time
thank
you
what
about
the
cherry
pie
oh
dear
wig
lady
is
that
what
they
call
me
i
don't
care
for
that
i
mean
i
have
to
do
something
to
hide
this
it's
paralyzing
don't
try
to
move
dear
you
really
can't
much
the
paralysis
spreads
upward
by
the
way
you
may
want
to
flail
your
arms
a
bit
while
you
still
can
did
i
tell
you
you're
my
favorite
doublemeat
workers
you're
all
so
full
of
doublemeat
burgers
and
you
just
slide
down
so
smooth
oh
i
just
love
the
paralysis
it
means
i
can
eat
you
slowly
i
know
you're
under
there
visitors
how
nice
