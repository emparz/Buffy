well
if
we
know
where
they
are
shouldn't
we
do
something
please
continue
the
story
of
failure
okay
see
this
is
why
demons
are
better
than
people
when
i
was
a
vengeance
demon
i
caused
pain
and
mayhem
certainly
but
i
put
in
a
full
day's
work
doing
it
and
i
got
compensated
appropriately
but
supervillains

want
reward
without
labor
to
make
things
come
easy
it's
wrong
without
labor
there
can
be
no
payment
and
vice
versa
the
country
cannot
progress
the
workers
are
the
tools
that
shape
america
we're
here
to
support
your
subsistencelevel
employment
bravo
disappear
poof
well
isn't
that
him
over
there
getting
the
pickles
wet
well
if
you
like
the
food
here
honey
maybe
we
should
get
it
for
the
reception
well
time
is
running
very
short
after
willow
gave
us
the
'whoosh'
engagement
party
i
got
slack
on
the
planning
'cause
i
figured
she'd
help
but
well
now
that's
all
been
blown
to
hell
sorry
didn't
mean
to
tempt
you
everyone's
so
delicate
anyway
i
still
have
to
select
the
bridesmaids'
dresses
and
well
then
there
are
the
guests
from
out
of
town
and
the
ones
from
the
demon
realm

you
wouldn't
believe
how
many
of
them
have
yet
to
let
us
know
either
way
xander
i'm
starting
to
think
that
maybe
we
should
do
a
potluck
thing
halfrek
how
are
you
how
are
you
funny
halfrek
i
didn't
summon
you
to
kill
xander
i
called
to
invite
you
to
our
wedding
gosh
it's
swell
to
see
you
again
hallie
i
didn't
mean
to
have
you
materialize
all
the
way
here
i
mean
notnot
till
the
ceremony
i
mean
yes
well
because
i
love
him
oh
we're
gonna
be
very
happy
together
what
you
keep
asking
about
him
do
you
think
i'm
making
a
mistake
well
no
xander
he
he's
very
kind
and
brave

he
has
the
sweetest
smile
and
the
nicest
body
and

he
loves
me
i
mean
sometimes
it
isn't
easy
but
he
does
well
you
know
i'll
do
something
or
say
something
and
and
then
he
has
to
say
stuff
like
'it's
incorrect
for
you
to
appreciate
money
so
much'
or
or
'observe
here
is
how
a
real
human
would
behave'
halfrek
oh
so
he
corrects
you
well
no
it's
just

um

well
no
i
mean
now
i'm
all
confused
i
mean
wha
do
you
think
there's
something
wrong
with
with
the
way
he
treats
me
okay
you
have
to
stop
doing
that
i
love
xander
bbut
he
doesn't
he
doesn't
think
that
bbut
i
am
i
mean

it's
not
like
i'm
hiding
any
deficiencies
or
anything
i'm
here
i'm
here
oh
so
sorry
i
hurried
she's
gone
is
there
something
wrong
with
that
i
mean
did
you
think
she
was
unattractive
halfrek
was
always
considered
to
be
a
great
beauty
it's
not
like
you're
so
perfect
either
what
with
your

strangely
large
upper
arms
and
your
tendency
to
criticize
well
is
it
demony
i
mean
maybe
someone's

you
know
killing
demons
and
using
them
as
a
cheap
source
of
meat
i
mean
we've
all
heard
of
that
and
by
the
way
i'm
opposed
to
using
demon
meat
no
matter
how
much
money
it
saves
does
that
surprise
you
