west

now
you're
seeing
it
all
from
a

way

seeing
it
from
behind
the
counter
because
you've
just
become
part
of
the
doublemeat
experience

cow
and
this
chicken

know
it
yet
but
they're
destined
to
become
part
of
it
as
well
so
what
happens
when
a
cow
and
a
chicken
come
together
why
that's
a
doublemeat
medley

take
a
look
now
at
the
process
of
harvesting
these
two
special
meats
washing
your
hands
thoroughly
after
each
visit
to
the
restroom
follow
these
rules
and
you'll
be
a
