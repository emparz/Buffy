you
should
have
seen
their
headquarters
it
was
like
the
nerd
natural
habitat
we
tried
buffy
was
gonna
go
in
there
and
bust
them
on
the
spot
hey
respect
the
narrative
flow
much
so
buffy
went
in
but
they'd
cleared
out
and
she
brought
back
the
stuff
that
they
left

spell
books
some
parchments
a
couple
of
rare
things
charmed
objects
and
a
conjurer's
harp
aand
they
had
other
stuff
you
know
razor
scooters
and
pictures
of
the
vulcan
woman
on
enterprise
xander
ooh
i
mean

nerds
interesting
turn
yep
for
the
rest
of
your
life
uh
sorry
i
uh
yeah
uh

something's
wrong
and
the
glasses
hey
standing
right
here
standing
right
exactly
here
come
in
d'you
want
something
you
want
it
really
no
iit's
not
stupid
you
can
have
it
of
course
it's
good
it's
really
good
i
mean
iit
was
hard
at
first

frustrating

doing
everything
the
slow
way
it
was
like
'is
everything
gonna
take
forever
forever'
amy
yeah
but
uh
it's
better
now
i'm

getting
my
focus
back
it's
a
pivotal
page
what
no
don't
think
that's
the
way
to
look
at
it
um
no
it
isn't
but
now
that
you
mention
it
buffy's
is
coming
what
amy
late
late
sorry
i

i
was
reading
for
school
well
highlighting
anyway
anyway
late
what
are
we
doing
let's
jump
right
in
did
xander
say
something
about
food
whoa
bad
well
yeah
i
can
start
analyzing
it
with
science
not

i
can
use
science
you
ate
it
cool
you
go
we'll
be
good
i'm
just
worried
about
buffy
don't
need
magic
don't
need
it
don't
need
it
hey
guys
ii
think
i've
got
it
no
no
potions
it's
not
magic
it's
chemistry
you
can
tell
by
how
damn
slow
it
is
i
made
a
solution
that
reacts
to
the
proteins
in
human
blood
so
we're
pretty
close
to
knowing
for
certain
hold
this
okay
if
the
solution
reacts
to
the
proteins
then
i'll
be
able
to
see
it
i
mean
i'll
be
able
to
look
through
the
microscope
and
and
then
see
it
there's
no
reaction
which
means
it's
not
human
there's
something
weird
here
buffy
are
you
in
there
i
can't
see
you
inside
buffy
if
you're
in
there
the
burger
isn't
people
they
aren't
even
meat
it's
all
processed
vegetables
isn't
that
weird
buffy
there's
more
something
happened
today

iit
wasn't
my
fault
it
was
amy's
fault
but
i
feel
so
bad
about
it
it
was
amy's
power
but
but
it
felt
like
i
was
doing
everything
myself
and
i
couldn't
stop
and
now
it's
gone
and
i
feel
kinda
shaky
and

like
i
i
need
it

buffy

really
can't
you
can't
come
in
here
