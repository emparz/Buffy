and
you
say
this
demon
wanted
cash
that's
very
unusual
no
not
really
a
common
term
in
demonology
of
kane
uh
i
uh
as
always
my
sacred
duty
as
a
watcher
prevents
me
from
ah
why
right
books
of
ascension
mayor
slaughter
tell
you
what
why
don't
we
try
to
find
this
demon
sooner
rather
than
later
i
imagine
so
where
is
faith
anyway
find
anything
i've
had
no
better
luck
there
must
be
something
about
this
accession
somewhere
no
i
don't
uh
it
should
be
i
that

the
council
isn't
entirely
aware
that
i'm
letting
you
work
for
me
um
with
me
i
don't
think
they'd
be
very
happy
at
the
idea
of
the
two
of
us
collaborating
i
think
the
most
expedient
plan
would
be
to
find
these
books
of
ascension
themselves
buffy
you
and
faith
must
find
this
demon
and
soon
wait
for
faith
buffy
this
is
a
job
for
the
both
of
you
this
demon
could
be
anywhere
if
these
books
are
important
as
he
says
he
has
good
reason
to
hide
finding
him
is
going
to
be
extremely
difficult
our
enemy
has
us
at
a
disadvantage
we
seem
to
be
consistently
one
step
behind
him
now
he
has
the
books
of
ascension
we
must
take
definitive
action
yes
let's
uh
let's
try
to
stay
on
track
we
need
everyone
working
together
here
where's
angel
and
faith
it's
uh
it's
quite
alright
willow
good
idea
there
must
be
information
on
the
mayor
there
right
mayor
wilkins
is
over
one
hundred
years
old
he's
not
human
angelus
has
turned
xander
this
is
terribly
serious
are
you
sure
we
must
contact
giles
immediately
well
i
for
one
protest
you
pitted
slayer
against
slayer
in
a
dangerous
charade
that
could've
gotten
them
both
killed
without
informing
me
i'm
telling
the
council
