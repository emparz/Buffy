in
trouble
the
real
bad
kind
no

a
couple
of
county
lines

mind
if
i
skip
past
the
'mom
never
loved
me'
part
and
get
right
to
it
i'm
scaring
myself
that's
why
i
came
to
you
i
don't
want
to
get
all
twelve
steppy
but
remember
when
you
told
me
that
killing
people
would
make
me
feel
like
some
kind
of
god
i
think
i
just
came
down
to
earth
it's
not
human
if
that's
what
you're
thinking
not
that
that
makes
me
feel
any
better
or
this
guy
any
less
dead
i
know
for
real
now
i'm
scared
scared
of
what
i
am
what
i'm
turning
into
coldblooded
straight
up
killer
like
you
believe
me
i
don't
want
to
end
up
the
way
everybody
said
i
would
dead
or
alone
or
a
loser
i
don't
know
maybe
it's
too
late
for
me
angel
i'm
so
scared
buffy
yeah
i
didn't
mean
it
like
that
maybe
i
did
but
i
wouldn't
press
it
you
love
her

you
good
for
you
the
two
of
you
you're
lucky
friends

some
time
alone

worry
about
me
you've
been
a
big
help
just
knowing
somebody
cares
hey
i
know
i
shouldn't
be
asking
this
but
do
you
think
if
things
were
different
that
things
between
you
and
me
would
be
different
too
right
how
could
we
lifetime
of
practice
it's
not
like
i
wasn't
trying
okay
try
buffy
summers
like
in
a
big
fat
one
track
way
i
was
thinking
more
along
the
lines
of
a
long
weekend
but
okay
mention
what
where
we
going
girlfriend
why
should
you
get
to
have
all
the
fun
share
share
that's
fair
right
oh
well
let's
go
look
him
up
right

i
was
patrolling
no
shortage
of
scum

the
books
too
some
hit
maybe
the
guy

up
a
fight
we
gotta
get
going
come
on
nothing
we
can
do
here
now
you
coming
hey
sorry
to
bust
in
uninvited
look
i'm
not
so
good
at
apologies
mostly
because
i
think
the
world's
out
to
screw
me
so
i'm
generally
more
owed
than
owing
but
i've
been
thinking
about
last
night
and
i
want
you
to
know
i
was
really
sorry
no
it's
not
alright
yeah
i
was
freaked
and
needed
somebody
but
you're
with
buffy
i
should
know
better
you
don't
trust
me
hey
no
problem
join
the
club
chump
i
wanted
to
do
this
the
oldfashioned
way
but
hey
your
loss
lucky
i've
got
some
tricks
buffy
don't
know
yet
i
know
but
it's
fun
now
relax
it'll
be
over
soon
i've
got
my
reasons
you
wanna
be
smart
you
listen
to
me
not
how
buffy
tells
it
you
want
to
listen
or
you
want
to
die
last
time
you
got
like
this
buffy
kicked
your
ass
all
the
way
back
to
hell
you
want
to
do
better
this
time
good
boy
now
all
you
got
to
do
is
play
nice
and
call
truce
and
i'll
hook
you
up
with
the
real
power
in
this
town
interested
then
get
ready
to
meet
the
new
boss
so
can
i
keep
him
let's
do
it
knock
knock
we
got
the
books
we'd
take
'em
to
giles
ourselves
but
i
think
strength
in
numbers
is
the
way
to
go
come
on
speak
for
yourself
b
me
i
like
it
here
bondage
looks
good
on
you
b
the
outfit's
all
wrong
but
hey
really
weird
because
something
about
all
this
just
feels
so
right
maybe
it's
one
of
those
unhappy
childhood
things
see
when
i
was
a
kid
i
used
to
beg
my
mom
for
a
dog
didn't
matter
what
kind
i
just
wanted
you
know
something
to
love
a
dog's
all
i
wanted
well
that
and
toys
but
mom
was
so
busy
you
know
enjoying
the
drinking
and
passing
out
parts
of
life
that
i
never
really
got
what
i
wanted
until
now
yeah
hunh
guess
we'll
just
have
to
keep
you
around
for
a
while
then
before
we
get
started
i
just
want
you
to
know
if
you're
a
screamer
feel
free
what
isn't
you
know
i
come
to
sunnydale
i'm
the
slayer
i
do
my
job
kicking
ass
better
than
anyone
what
do
i
hear
about
everywhere

go
buffy

do
the
good
little
girl
