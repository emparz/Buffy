demons
after
money
whatever
happened
to
the
still
beating
heart
of
a
virgin
no
one
has
any
standards
anymore
i'm
not
sure
where
did
you
find
that
volume
ah
yes
yes
here
we
are
there's
a
reference
here
to
the
journal
of
desmond
kane
pastor
of
a
town
called
sharpsville
of
sharpsville
the
town
more
or
less
disappeared
i
think
you
should
meet
with
this
demon
buffy
six
course
banquet
of
nothing
with
a
scoop
of
sodall
as
a
palate
closer
perhaps
i
should
contact
the
council
maybe
run
a
search
well
i
wasn't
about
to
burst
into
glorious
song
about
it
myself
why
don't
you
call
did
you
get
a
receipt
again
see
no
standards
i
mean
any
selfrespecting
demon
should
be
living
in
a
pit
of
filth
or
a
nice
crypt
buffy
i
think
you
should
try
to
retrieve
the
books
of
ascension
check
out
the
mayor's
office
but
be
damned
careful
do
not
confront
the
mayor
we
don't
know
a
thing
about
him
right
willow
how
far
did
you
get
with
the
mayor's
files
wesley
why
don't
you
take
the
group
and
start
looking
there
is
just
the
one
group
anyone
finds
anything
check
in
with
me
be
careful
yes
thank
you
for
coming
to
me
and
for
that
rather
effective
light
show
you
put
on
i
shan't
peace
with
you
i
introduced
him
to
his
wife
i
think
you
should
we
have
a
rogue
slayer
on
our
hands
i
can't
think
of
anything
more
dangerous
and
we
know
a
little
bit
more
about
the
ascension
