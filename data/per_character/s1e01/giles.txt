can
i
help
you
miss
summers
i'm
mr
giles
the
librarian
i
was
told
you
were
coming
are
you
sure
my
mistake
so
what
is
it
you
said
sorry
yes
i
was
afraid
of
this
then
why
are
you
here
is
he
wwill
he
rise
again
the
boy
can
you
be
sure
you
really
have
no
idea
what's
going
on
do
you
you
think
it's
coincidence
your
being
here
that
boy
was
just
the
beginning
because
you
are
the
slayer
into
each
generation
a
slayer
is
born
one
girl
in
all
the
world
a
chosen
one
one
born
with
the
strength
and
skill
to
hunt
the
vampires
i
really
don't
understand
this
attitude
you
you've
accepted
your
duty
you
you've
slain
vampires
before
what
do
you
know
about
this
town
dig
a
bit
in
the
history
of
this
place
you'll
find
a
a
steady
stream
of
fairly
odd
occurrences
now
i
believe
this
whole
area
is
a
center
of
mystical
energy
that
things
gravitate
towards
it
that
that
that
you
might
not
find
elsewhere
like
zombies
werewolves
incubi
succubi
everything
you've
ever
dreaded
was
under
your
bed
but
told
yourself
couldn't
be
by
the
light
of
day
they're
all
real
ah
wwwyes
um
the
calendar
ii'm
a
watcher
ii
haven't
the
skill
a
a
slayer
slays
a
watcher
yes
no
he
he
trains
her
he
he
he
prepares
her
damn
it's
getting
worse
the
influx
of
the
undead
the
supernatural
occurrences
it's
been
building
for
years
there's
a
reason
why
you're
here
and
a
reason
why
it's
now
something's
coming
something
something
something
is
is
gonna
happen
here
soon
the
signs
as
far
as
i
can
tell
point
to
a
crucial
mystical
upheaval
very
soon
days
possibly
less
oh
right
this
is
me
having
fun
watching
clown
hair
prance
about
is
hardly
my
idea
of
a
party
i'd
much
rather
be
at
home
with
a
cup
of
bovril
and
a
good
book
this
is
a
perfect
breeding
ground
for
vampire
activity
it's
dark
it's
crowded
besides
i
knew
you
were
likely
to
show
up
and
i
have
to
make
you
understand
what
did
you
say
i'm
not
sure
uh
wwho
told
you
this
no
the
harvest
did
he
say
anything
else
look
at
them
throwing
themselves
about
completely
unaware
of
the
danger
that
surrounds
them
or
perhaps
you're
right
perhaps
there
is
no
trouble
coming
the
signs
could
be
wrong
it's
not
as
though
you've
been
having
the
nightmares
will
you
be
ready
there's
so
much
you
don't
know
about
them
about
your
own
powers
a
vampire
appears
to
be
completely
normal
until
the
feed
is
upon
them
only
then
do
they
reveal
their
true
demonic
visage
the
point
is
a
slayer
should
be
able
to
see
them
anyway
without
looking
without
thinking
can
you
tell
me
if
there's
a
vampire
in
this
building
you
should
know
even
through
this
mass
and
this
din
you
should
be
able
to
sense
them
well
try
reach
out
with
your
mind
you
have
to
hone
your
senses
focus
until
the
energy
washes
over
you
until
you
you
feel
every
particle
oof
wwhere
you
don't
know
it's
dated
but
you
didn't
hone
isn't
that
what's
she
doing
that
was
quick
well
done
ii
need
to
go
to
the
library
this
harvest
thing
the
vampire
is
not
dead
so
what
do
we
do
iii
need
to
come
with
you
yes
