the
library

you
hanging
out

could
totally
help
you
out
uh
if
you
have
sixth
period
free
we
could
meet
in
the
library

has
that
effect
on
most
kids
i
love
it
though
it's
a
great
collection
and
the
new
librarian
is
really
cool
yeah
he
just
started
he
was
a
curator
at
some
british
museum

he
knows
everything

hard
for
me
to
say
anything
cool

all
ii
can
usually
make
a
few
vowel
sounds

have
to
go

i
think
boys
are
more
interested
in
a
girl

probably
easy
for
you

don't
seem
too
shy
