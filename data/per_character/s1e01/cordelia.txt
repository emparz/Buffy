hi
i'm
cordelia
if
you're
looking
for
a
textbook
of
your
very
own
there's
probably
a
few
in
the
library
i'll
show
you
come
on
so
you're
from
hemery
right
in
la
oh
i
would
kill
to
live
in
la
that
close
to
that
many
shoes
well
you'll
be
okay
here
if
you
hang
with
me
and
mine
you'll
be
accepted
in
no
time
of
course
we
do
have
to
test
your
coolness
factor
you're
from
la
so
you
can
skip
the
written
but
let's
see
vamp
nail
polish
so
over
james
spader
frappaccinos
john
tesh
that
was
pretty
much
a
gimme
but
you
passed
willow
nice
dress
good
to
know
you've
seen
the
softer
side
of
sears
no
wonder
you're
such
a
guy
magnet
are
you
done
you
wanna
fit
in
here
the
first
rule
is
know
your
losers
once
you
can
identify
them
all
by
sight
they're
a
lot
easier
to
avoid
and
if
you're
not
too
swamped
with
catching
up
you
should
come
by
the
bronze
tonight
the
bronze
it's
the
only
club
worth
going
to
around
here
they
let
anybody
in
but
it's
still
the
scene
it's
in
the
bad
part
of
town
about
a
half
a
block
from
the
good
part
of
town
we
don't
have
a
whole
lot
of
town
here
but
um
you
should
show
good
so
um
i'll
see
you
in
gym
and
you
can
tell
me
absolutely
everything
there
is
to
know
about
you
are
these
guys
bothering
you
oh
please
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
your
downward
mobility
but
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
that
you
won't
be
meeting
coach
foster
the
woman
with
the
chest
hair
because
gym

canceled
due
to
the
extreme
dead
guy
in
the
locker
some
guy
was
stuffed
in
aura's
locker
totally
dead
way
dead

have
an
elsewhere

mom

of
bed
anymore
and
the
doctor
says

chronic
hepatitis
or

least
chronic
fatigue
syndrome

epsteinbarr
anymore
