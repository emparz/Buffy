angeles
interesting
record
quite
a
career
welcome
to
sunnydale
a
clean
slate
buffy
that's
what
you
get
here
what's
past
is
past
we're
not
interested
in
what
it
says
on
a
piece
of
paper
even
if
it
says
whoa
all
the
kids
here
are
free
to
call
me
bob
but
they
don't
heeey
we're
not
caring
about
that
do
you
think
uh
'colorful'
is
the
word
not
uh
'dismal'
you
burned
down
the
gym
buffy
don't
worry
any
other
school
they
might
say
'watch
your
step'
or
'we'll
be
watching
you'
but
that's
just
not
the
way
here
we
want
to
service
your
needs
and
help
you
to
respect
our
needs
and
if
your
needs
and
our
needs
don't
mesh
