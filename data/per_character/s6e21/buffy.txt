xander
we
don't
have
time
i
know
that's
why
we
have
to
keep
moving
you
heard
what
she
said
one
down
anya
so
we're
talking
about
two
to
go
right
jonathan
and
whatshisface
the
other
guy
andrew
they're
sitting
at
county
jail
without
a
clue
willow's
coming
willow's
got
an
addictive
personality
and
she
just
tasted
blood
she
could
be
there
already
i'm
counting
the
ways
that
could
go
wrong
against
willow
tonight

don't
be
too
sure
doesn't
matter

willow
just
killed
someone
killing
people
changes
you
believe
me
i
know
maybe
andrew
and
jonathan
don't
i
hope
so
whatever
she's
going
through
we
have
to
stop
her
and
maybe
we
can
actually
do
that
if
we
can
get
to
your
car
i
guess
she
wants
to
finish
the
job
without
us
tagging
along
meet
me
at
the
jail
we
have
to
make
a
run
for
it
pretty
much
is
she
coming
are
you
guys
all
right
are
you
injured
we'll
find
someplace
safe
and
we'll
keep
you
there
until
we
can
stop
willow
because
she
doesn't
want
you
dead
she
wants
to
kill
you
maybe
she's
just
getting
her
mojo
up
and
running
or
maybe
she
hasn't
figured
out
exactly
how
much
power
she
really
has
yet
neither
have
we
drive
faster
whatever
we've
got
better
grab
it
fast
this
is
one
of
the
first
places
she's
gonna
think
to
look
for
us
we
need
to
find
some
sort
of
magicks
that'll
stop
willow
or
at
least
slow
her
down
xander
but
she
drained
the
place
shut
up
thank
you
now
you
remember
that
thing
we
talked
about
i
talk
to
her
look

whatever
she's
gonna
do
she
starts
with
those
two
they're
the
line
she
cannot
cross
and
if
she's
running
low
on
magicks

then
she's
probably
somewhere
right
now
trying
to
get
it
all
back
i
think
you
need
to
get
away
from
her
you
need
to
back
down
a
minute
and
think
will
you're
attacking
the
people
who
love
you
now
that's
not

you
need
help
dawn
get
out
of
here
go
willow
i
know
what
you
want
to
do
but
you
have
to
listen
to
me
the
forces
inside
you
are
incredibly
powerful
they're
strong

but
you're
stronger
you
have
to
remember
you're
still
willow
i
can
help
i
know
this
hurts
bad
but
willow
if
you
let
loose
with
the
magicks
it
will
never
end
you
don't
want
that
because
you
lose
everything
your
friends
your
self
willow
if
you
let
this
control
you
then
the
world
goes
away
and
all
of
us
with
it
there's
so
much
to
live
for
will
there's
too
much
willow
oh
please
this
is
your
pitch
buffy
you
hate
it
here
as
much
as
i
do
i'm
just
more
honest
about
it
that's
not
true
dawn
don't
will
xander
no
don't
will
stop
you
need
to
give
this
up
now
will
back
off
before
somebody
gets
hurt
i
don't
want
to
hurt
you
i
said
i
didn't
want
to
didn't
say
i
wouldn't
are
we
really
gonna
do
this
a
killer
isn't
a
slayer
being
a
slayer
means
something
you
can't
conceive
of
then
show
me
what
you
got
and
i'll
show
you
what
a
slayer
really
is
i
can
help
you
stop
