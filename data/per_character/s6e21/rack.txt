hey
babe
i
been
waiting
for
you
guess
the
rehab
didn't
take
huh
that's
the
way
it
goes
sometimes
but
i
gotta
say

i
could
feel
you
coming
a
mile
away
the
power
you
got
and
you
know
something
sweetness
i
liked
it
when
you
first
came
to
me
you
were
just
a
little

slip
of
a
girl
look
at
you
now
all

growed
up
so
full
of
dark
juice
and
you
still
taste
like
strawberries
only
now

you're
ripe
you
came
because
you
want
something
don't
you
i
thought
so
so
tell
me
strawberry
what
on
this
earth
do
you
want
