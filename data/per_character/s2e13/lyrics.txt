take
me
over
i'm
lying
down

i'm
giving
in
to
you
i'm
a
hurricane
i
cannot
describe
this
feeling
now
that
i've
found
this
love
i'll
do
anything
for
you
now
that
i've
found
this
love
i'm
a
fire
burning
like
a
house
aflame
i'm
a
hurricane
i
cannot
move
or
see
you
fly

now
that
i've
found
this
love
if
you
want
to
know
how

to
fly
high
then
go
now

to
the
place
where
all
the
concubines

meet
and
converse
with
them

marvel
at
their
pale
skin

wonder
how
they
chew
on
their
pointy

teeth
and
hair
are
beauty

they
know
it's
their
duty

to
be
countess
in
their
hearts
and
their
minds
that
have
to
whisper

see
in
them
a
sister

look
into
their
eyes
and
you'll
become

transylvanian
concubine
you
know
what
flows
there
like
wine

sorrow
is
their
master

cackling
with
laughter

now
he's
having
just
one
piece
of
cakey
is
their
make
up

catholics
try
to
shake
up
