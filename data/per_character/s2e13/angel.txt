it
was
just
a
dream
it
wasn't
real

wasn't
i'm
right
here
still
not
every
dream
you
have
comes
true
i
mean
what
else

last
night
can
you
remember

itit's
a
legend
way
before
my
time
of
a
demon
brought
forth
to
rid
the
earth
of
the
plague
of
humanity
separate
the
righteous
from
the
wicked
and
to
burn
the
righteous
down
they
call
him
the
judge
not
all
of
him
the
pieces
were
scattered
buried
in
every
corner
of
the
earth
she's
just
crazy
enough
to
do
it
and
bring
forth
armageddon
she's
right
i
gotta
get
this
to
the
remotest
region
possible
i
gotta
catch
a
cargo
ship
to
asia
maybe
trek
to
nepal
i
can't
fly
there's
no
sure
way
to
guard
against
the
daylight
iii
don't
like
this
any
more
than
you
do
buffy
but
there's
no
other
choice
tonight
as
soon
as
possible
i
should
go
the
rest
of
the
way
alone
but
i'll
be
back
i
will
hey
if
we'll
even
what
don't
say
that
we'll
be
fine

just
the
deal

something
for
you
for
your
birthday

i
was
gonna
give
it
to
you
earlier
but
my
people

before

exchanged
this
as
a
sign
of
devotion
it's
a
claddagh
ring
the
hands
represent
friendship
the
crown
represents
loyalty
and
the
heart
well
you
know
wear
it

the
heart
pointing
towards
you
