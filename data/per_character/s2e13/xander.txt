so
buffy's
party
manana
you're
cooking
horrors
all
that
opening
and
stirring
well
then
you
should
have
a
person
who
does
such
things
for
you
um
so
uh
you're
going
and
and
and
i'm
going
should
we
maybe
go
i
dunno
this
thing
with
us
despite
our
better
judgment
it
keeps
happening
maybe
we
should
just
admit
that
we're
dating
fine
i'll
spend
then
we'll
grope
whatever
i
just
think
it's
some
kind
of
whacked
that
we
feel
we
have
to
hide
it
from
all
our
friends
you
know
what
'nuff
said
forget
it
it
must've
been
my
multiplepersonality
guy
talking
i
call
him
idiot
jed
glutton
for
punishment
absolutely
you
ready
to
get
down
you
funky
party
weasel
you
coulda
just
said
'shh'
god
are
all
you
brits
such
drama
queens
buffy
i
feel
a
prebirthday
spanking
coming
on
check
cancel
spanking
again
so
many
words
couldn't
you
just
say
'we'd
be
in
trouble'
gone
notice
the
economy
of
phrasing
'gone'
simple
direct
hey
it's
the
woman
of
the
hour
you
ground
his
bones
to
make
your
bread
well
that's
not
a
perky
birthday
puppy
mmhm
looks
like
mr
caution
man
but
the
sound
he
makes
is
funny
you're
a
great
man
of
our
time
tch
yep
vampires
are
real
a
lot
of
them
live
in
sunnydale
willow
will
fill
you
in
well
clearly
the
hellmouth's
answer
to
'what
do
you
get
the
slayer
who
has
everything'
giles
good
heavens
buffy
are
you
all
right
what
uh
vamp's
version
of
'snakes
in
a
can'
or
do
you
care
to
share
hmm
it's
sad
granted
but
let's
look
at
the
upside
for
a
moment
i
mean
what
kind
of
a
future
would
she've
really
had
with
him
she's
got
2
jobs

denny's
waitress
by
day
slayer
by
night

and
angel's
always
in
front
of
the
tv
with
a
big
blood
belly
and
he's
dreamin'
of
the
glory
days
when
buffy
still
thought
this
whole
creature
of
the
night
routine
was
a
big
turn
on
no
no
that's
just
the
beginning
have
i
told
you
the
part
where
i
fly
into
town
in
my
private
jet
and
take
buffy
out
for
prime
rib
and
she
cries
and
we
needed
clothes
because
what's
the
problem
we
send
cordy
to
fight
this
guy
and
we
go
for
pizza
mom
