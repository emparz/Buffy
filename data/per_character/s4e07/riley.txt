no
i'm
with
this
large
pile
of
ungraded
papers
due
at
300
she's
buffy
it's
her
name
forrest
i
haven't
really
thought
about
what
i
think
of
her
no
i
mean
she's
all
right
i
guess
she's
just
kind
of
i
don't
know
peculiar
i
don't
dislike
her
she
just
she
never
feels
like
she's
really
there
when
you
talk
to
her
i
like
girls
i
can
get
a
grip
on
not
that
way
just
a
little
less
ready
for
takeoff
all
the
time
there's
definitely
something
off
about
her
abrams
yeah
there's
a
sign
of
good
taste
well
i'm
not
denying
she's
easy
on
the
eyes
i'm
just
saying

buffy
spills
both
drink
and
yogurt
on
the
floor
would
you
really
want
to
go
out
with
her
he's
not
in
this
class
anymore
i
hear
he
dropped
out
really
you
don't
think
she's
a
little
peculiar
so
she
says
'you
teach
human
behavior
maybe
you
ought
to
show
some'
forrest
oh
you're
lying
she
says
that
to
walsh
hope
to
die
yeah
but
she's
nuts
i
can't
believe
that
i
did
that
i
hit
him
hehe
was
just
being
so
crude
and
most
of
those
are
about
your
own
mother
i
just
didn't
like
hearing
him
talk
about
buffy
that
way
i
think
i
well
i
guess
i
like
her
so
you
you
knew
that
i
had
feelings
for
her
i'm
always
the
last
to
know
well
i
guess
i'm
gonna
go
see
a
girl
hi
gee
i
hope
i'm
not
interrupting
anything
really
depressing
right
to
the
point
ok
i
was
thinking
of
asking
out
buffy
i
know
see
i
don't
know
that
much
about
buffy
but
i'm
interested
in
what
she
likes
and
so
far
well
the
only
thing
that
i
know
she
likes
is
you
just
tell
me
something
anything
just
give
me
a
clue
to
here
let
me
help
you
with
that
just
something
that
will
start
us
talking
you
know
i'm
thinking
that
how
'bout
them
broncos
won't
really
cut
it
yep
that's
the
plan
oh
look
if
you
want
to
tell
me
to
go
to
hell
that's
ok
maybe
this
is
the
last
thing
you
want
to
talk
about
i
just
feel
that
well
i've
never
courted
anyone
like
buffy
before
i
don't
think
i've
ever
met
anyone
like
buffy
before
just
sort
of
hoping
you'd
think
i
have
an
honest
face
all
right
i
guess
i'm
not
gonna
win
here
and
i
appreciate
you
wanting
to
protect
your
friend
i
guess
uh
she
kind
of
brings
that
out
in
people
what
well
i'm
not
saying
it's
the
key
to
her
heart
but
buffy
she
likes
cheese
that's
a
start
oh
you're
going
that's
my
house
i
live
there
fresh
i
don't
even
know
if
we
like
each
other
yet
hey
does
she
ever
talk
about
me
like
has
she
ever
said
that's
discouraging
still
i
feel
like
i
have
a
fighting
chance
with
my
new
accomplice

course
