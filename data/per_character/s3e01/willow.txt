that's
right
big
boy
come
and
get
it
he's
getting
away
and



ow
well



wwell
the
slayer
always
says
a
pun
oror
a
witty
play
on
words
and
i
think
it
throws
the
vampires
off
and
and
it
makes
them
frightened
because
i'm
wisecracking
okay
i
didn't
really
have
a
chance
to
work
on
that
one
but
you
try
it
every
time
xander
past
tense
rule
do
you
think
buffy
knows
school's
starting
tomorrow
oh
i'm
gonna
be
busy
a
lot
but
but
only
till
3
and
that's
when
you
usually
get
up
i
wonder
what
our
first
homework
assignment's
gonna
be
hey
you're
excited
over
cordelia
okay
we've
all
got
issues
wouldn't
it
be
great
if
buffy
just
showed
up
tomorrow
like
nothing
happened
well
yeah
ii
know
i
just
wish



i
wish
we
knew
where
she
was
no
he
got
away
we
still
have
some
glitches
in
the
system
like



vampires
getting
away
but
i
think
we're
improving
you'd
be
cranky
well
we
try
not
to
get
killed
that's
part
of
our
whole
mission
statement
'don't
get
killed'
she
takes
the
books
and
stacks
them
together
again
hi
how
was
your
summer
oh
it
was
okay
well
uh
yeah
somewhere
oh
yeah
uh
it's
good
still
good
hi
you
came
to
visit
me
you
came
with
books
are
they
books
for
me
i
don't
get
it
well
i
know
you
had
a
lot
of
incompletes
but
that's
what
summer
school
was
for
but
you
never
said
anything
how
am
i
supposed
to
react
to
this
rather
alarming
news
well
traditionally
you
know
repeating
a
grade
isn't
exactly
a
turnon
aand
you're
practically
a
genius
you're
mr
test
scores
iit's
all
a
little
weird
yeah
she's
around
here
somewhere
i'm
trying
to
get
to
cute
really
but
i'm
still
sorta
stuck
on
'strange'
but
it's
good
that
you're
looking
though
you
shouldn't
give
up
you
don't
think
maybe
he'll
find
her
it's
possible
the
bronze
just
never
seems
the
same
without
her
we
just
need
to
work
on
our
timing
i
think
help
