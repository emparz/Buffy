we're
looking
for
a
friend
well
do
you
know
if
he's
been
in
the
last
day

so
this'll
probably
go
faster
if
we
split
up
okay
where
did
i
lose
you
on
the
whole
splitting
up
thing
i
was
thinking
we
could
check

some
of
your
hangouts
and
um
i
guess
meet
later
at
my
place
thanks
great
rickie
i'm
sorry
lily
there's
there's
something
else
the
the
person
that
i
found



was
old
hehe
looked
about
eighty
i'm
sure
it
was
i
i
don't
know
how
but



it
was
like
something
drained
the
life
out
of
him
no
a
vampire
couldn't
accelerate
the
aging
process
maybe
it
was
something
in
his
blood
when
was
the
last
time
you
guys
gave
blood
together
lily
this
is
something
you're
just
gonna
have
to
deal
with
that's
not
the
point
these
things
happen
all
the
time
you
can't
just



close
your
eyes
and
hope
that
they're
gonna
go
away
what
i
didn't
bring
anything
with
me
and
i
didn't
ask
for
you
to
come
to
me
with
your
problems
i
just
wanted
to
be
left
alone
if
you
can't
deal
then
don't
lay
it
off
on
me
candidate
for
what
breaking
into
your
office
and
going
through
your
private
files
candidate
for
what
now
you've
got
a
whole
bunch
of
candidates
here

wonder
if
any
of
them
are
missing
like
rickie
gosh
i
bet
they
are
i
don't
want
any
trouble

be
alone

room
with
a
chair
and
a
fireplace
and
a
tea
cozy

a
tea
cozy
