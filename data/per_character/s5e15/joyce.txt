you're
messing
with
me
so
is
anyone
gonna
talk
about
my
dress
you
sure
i
mean
it's
not
too
momish
oh
god
what
time
is
it
no
he
works
for
a
publishing
house
he's
a
nice
normal
guy
okay
he
came
to
the
gallery

my
first
day
back
when
i
was
you
know
kinda
shaky
starting
over
and
he
asked
a
question
about
these
antique
cameos
and
i
was
so
lost
because

carol
had
been
doing
the
ordering
while
i
was
sick
well
it
turned
out
that
he
didn't
know
anything
about
them
either
so
we
had
a
lot
to
talk
about
dinner
and
then
a
movie
or
maybe
it
was

a
movie
and
then
dinner
which
might
be
better
because

you
know
then
we
could
talk
about
the
movie
or
maybe
a
movie
isn't
a
good
idea
at
all
because
well
you
know
you
can't
talk
during
and
and
then
you
know
what's
the
point
of
any
of
it
oh
and
about
the
restaurant
do
you
think

that
it
should
be
one
with
candles
and
romantic
music
or
is
that
pushing
it
buffy
what
do
you
think
should
i
you
know
try
to
make
things
romantic
or

sorta
let
him
set
the
pace
honey
you
just
had
some
bad
luck
oh
god
brian
what
time
is
it
now
you
sure
the
dress
is
okay
who
wants
to
hear
everything
bye
rupert
gosh
i'd
forgotten
how
much
fun
dating
can
be
well
i
suppose
by
your
standards
it
could
seem
pretty

oh
dear
i
left
my
bra
in
his
car
i'm
joking
i
left
it
in
the
restaurant
on
the
dessert
cart
