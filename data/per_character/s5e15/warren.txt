new
stuff
now
let's
just
go
is
this
about
her
katrina
please
be
quiet
okay
this
is
important
wait
in
the
kitchen
i
can't
trina
shut
up
no
katrina
ahhh
yes
i
know
um
april
did
she
hurt
someone
she's
looking
for
me
you
know
uh
she
followed
me
here
no
no
there's
more
uh
there's
something
you
need
to
know
about
her
no
wait
this
is
important
no
this
is
something
uh
that
you
can't
possibly
know
she's
a
robot
kinda
oh
no
she's
not
a
toy
i
mean
i
know
what
you're
thinking
but
she's
more
than
that
no
i
made
her
to
love
me
i
didn't
make
a
toy
i
made
a
girlfriend
i
really
thought
i
would
be
you
know
she
got
boring
she
was
exactly
what
i
wanted
and
i
didn't
want
her
i
thought
i
was
going
crazy
then
something
happened
katrina
was
in
my
engineering
seminar
and
she
was
really
funny
and
cool
you
know
she
was
always
givin'
me
a
hard
time
real

unpredictable
she
builds
these
little
model
monorails
that
run
with
magnets
and

anyway
i
fell
in
love
with
katrina
kinda
okay
i
didn't
really
dump
her
as
much
as
i
uh
went
out
and
uh
didn't
come
back
i
left
her
i

left
her
in
my
dorm
room
well
i
figured
i
could
just
kinda
get
away
until
her
batteries
gave
out
which
should
have
been
days
ago
i
didn't
need
to
fix
anything
i
mean
her
batteries
were
supposed
to
run
down
really
they
should
be
completely
dead
by
now
i
don't
i
don't
know
i
mean
maybe

uh
she
must
be
recharging
them
somehow
she's
only
programmed
to
be
in
love
well
she's
looking
for
me
so
my
guess
is
she's
probably
pretty
close
april
april
are
you
there
if
the
batteries
are
still
working
and
she
hears
my
voice
then

she'll
answer
well
i
made
it
so
that
if
she
heard
me
and
she
didn't
answer
it
causes
this
kind
of
feedback
april
april
april
what
did
you
do
puput
her
down
this
is
buffy
give
katrina
to
buffy
no
no
this
isn't
a
game
that's
great
you
could
go
back
and
get
them
so
you
could
wait
there
and
buffy
warren
you
have
to
tell
her
and
do
it
right

a
mistake
no
i
did
i
thought
