violently

by

wanna
sit
down
here

that's
my
secret
to
attracting
men
you

simple
really
you
slap
'em
around
a
bit
you
torture
'em
you
make
their
lives
a
living
hell
xander
buff
and
sure
the
nice
guys
they'll
run
away
but
every
now
and
then
you'll
meet
a
real
prince
of
a
guy
like
spike

just

i
just
wanna
know
that
there's
gonna
be
another
good
one
one
that
i
won't
chase
away
yeah
and
the
minute
after
that
i
can
terrify
him
with
my
alarming
strength
and
remarkable
selfinvolvement
maybe
i
could
change
you
know
i
could
i
could
work
harder
i
could
spend
less
time
slaying
i
could
laugh
at
his
jokes
i
mean
men
like
that
right
the
the
jokelaughingat
xander
that's

aw
mm

you
go
the
other
way

just
wanted
to

some
unspeakably
awkward
double
dates
424
you

better
than

up
with
some
goodlooking
guy
thank
you
ben
hey
i
didn't
even
know
you
were
here

nonmedical
clothing

i
kind
of
have
this
bad
history
in
which
you
know
we
go
get
coffee
and

it
all
ends
with
with
you
leaving
town
and
you
just
got
here
and
everything
then
i'll
call
you
excuse
me
hi
um
uh
maybe
you
and
i
could
talk
you
know
'cause
throwing
spike
through
a
window
well
that's
really
good
um
but
you
know
generally
speaking
april
do
you
know
my
boyfriend
okay
i
think
you
need
to
take
a
second
and
stop
looking
for
your
boyfriend
ow
i
don't
know
about
you
guys
but
i've
had
it
with
superstrong
little
women
who
aren't
me
so
what
do
you
guys
think
she
is
i
mean
this
may
sound
nuts
but
i
kinda
got
the
impression
that
she
was
a
tara
robot
yeah
i
was
gonna
say
robot
what
do
you
think
she
wants
will
can
you

been
watching
dawn
while
my
mom's
out
on
her

a
feeling

only
so
much
he
can
take
what'd
she
make
you
do
i'm
sorry
i'm
very
very
sorry
but
if
it
makes
you
feel
any
better
my
'fun

a
robot
throw
spike
through
a
window

a
bad
time
i

in
my
pocket
and
you

figured
i'd
pick
up
the
phone
a
couple
of
times
and
then
hang
up
and
then
finally

i
i
worked

to
you
you're
not
gettin'

you
start
thinking
'hey

yeah
i
mean
i
felt
like
i
deserved
to
have
someone
you
know
i
mean
everyone
deserves
to
have
someone
so
naturally
you
turned
to
manufacturing
and
how
long
did
it
take
to
build
yourself
that
little
toy
i'm
sure
she
has
many
exciting
laborsaving
attachments
a
girlfriend
are
you
saying

are
you
in
love
with
her
really
you
swell
romance
and
magnetic
trains

decided
to
take
april
out
of
the
box

she
got
mad

didn't
go
huh
you
left
her
in
your
dorm
room
did
you
even
tell
her
i
mean
did
you
even
give
her
a
chance
to
fix
what
was
wrong
so
why
aren't
they
warren
this
is
important
is
she
dangerous
then
she's
dangerous
do
you
have
any
idea
how
to
find
her
she's
voiceactivated
wait
if
you
call
her
and
she
doesn't
answer
it
hurts
her
you're
one
creepy
little
dweeb
warren
april
i
want
you
to
put
the
girl
down
talk
to
her
she's
alive
she
growls
you
made
her
so
she
growls
can
you
cry
sometimes
i
feel
better
when
i
cry
but

there
might
be
rust
issues
oh
i'm
sure
you
were
i
don't
know
it
isn't
fair
he
wasn't
fair
to
you
yeah
i'm
here

make
sure
that
he
finds
you

sure
he
will
and
he'll

he'll
tell
you
how
sorry

told
me

how
proud
he
was
of
you

how
impressed
he
was
with
how
much
you
loved
him
and
how
you
tried
to
help
him

didn't
mean
to
hurt
you

your
own
business
you
have
your
slogan
right
there
and
she
wasn't
crazed
she
devoted
everything
to
making
this
one
person
happy
and
then
it
was
like

there
was
just

no
reason
for
her
to
exist
