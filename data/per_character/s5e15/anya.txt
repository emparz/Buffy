oh
well
at
first
it
was
confusing
just
the
idea
of
computers
was
like
'whoa
i'm
eleven
hundred
years
old
i
had
trouble
adjusting
to
the
idea
of
lutherans'
tara
i
go
online
sometimes
but

everyone's
spelling
is
really
bad
and
it's

depressing
but
you
have
to
try
online
trading
it's
great
the
secret
is
avoiding
the
tech
companies
everyone
was
jumping
on
and
and
going
with
the
smaller
firms
that
supply
the
basic
components
anyway
i
took
the
money
from
working
for
giles
and
i
tripled
it
yes
i'm
thinking
about
buying
something
very
expensive
maybe
an
antelope
hi
i'll
show
you
you
can
also
see
the
website
i
designed
for
the
magic
shop
huge
photo
of
me
i
let
them
do
that
dance
together
that
was
me
yes
i'm
expecting
a
big
karmic
reward
any
second
now
look
at
these
tiny
grain
patties
they're
woven
that's
craftsmanship
then
how
oh
that
girl
tara
and
i
met
her
she
speaks
with
a
strange
evenness
and
selects
her
words
a
shade
too
precisely
xander
got
hypnotized
by
the
strange
girl
i
am
remaining
calm
however
some
men
find
that
appealing
she
could
do
a
lot
of
damage
by
then
she
was
looking
for
someone
named
warren
it's
okay
for
him
to
say
that
'cause
i
know
that
he
really
loves
me
only
why
would
anyone
do
that
if
they
could
have
a
real
live
person
ooh
can
we
throw
him
out
the
window
like
the
robot
did
'cause
that
was
neat
