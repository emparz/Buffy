no
buffy's
right
the
deputy
mayor's
murder
was
the
result
of
human
malice
there's
nothing
supernatural
about
it
which
i'm
sure
the
police
are
doing
meantime
if
you
ask
me
there
are
better
uses
for
the
slayers'
time
considering
the
success
of
your
previous
adventure
what
did
you
need
happily
she's
a
student
here
we
go
buffy
i
don't
want
to
hear
it
buffy
i
don't
want
to
hear
any
more
lies
get
in
my
office
now
faith
i'll
talk
to
you
in
the
morning
now
faith
i
know
she
may
have
many
talents
buffy
but
fortunately
lying
is
not
one
of
them
i'm
sorry
i
needed
her
to
think
that
i
was
on
her
side
i
don't
know
how
far
she'll
take
this
charade
you
should
have
come
to
me
right
off
but
faith
wouldn't
hear
of
it
buffy
this
is
not
the
first
time
something
like
this
has
happened
the
slayer
is
on
the
front
line
of
a
nightly
war
now
it's
it's
tragic
but
accidents
have
happened
well
the
council
investigates
um
metes
out
punishment
if
punishment
is
due
but
i
i
have
no
plans
to
involve
them
i
mean
it's
the
last
thing
faith
needs
at
the
moment
she's
unstable
buffy
i
mean
she's
utterly
unable
to
accept
responsibility
she's
in
denial
there
is
no
help
for
her
until
she
admits
what
happened
perhaps
we
should
meet
itit
may
be
that
they're
seeing
a
different
side
of
her
in
the
meantime
no
one
else
is
to
know
understood
i
mean
this
is
extremely
delicate
if
we
scare
her
off
now
we
may
lose
her
forever
no
faith
is
too
defensive
for
a
confrontation
like
that
she'll
respond
better
to
a
oneonone
approach
no
i
don't
i
don't
see
it
xander
i
mean
of
of
all
of
us
you're
the
one
person
arguably
that
faith
has
had
the
least
contact
with
oh
fine
fine
let's
let's
let's
move
on
however
iif
you
still
want
to
be
of
assistance
i
i
i
need
some
help
with
research
there's
still
the
business
of
the
mayor
and
mr
trick
to
attend
to
yes
uh
willow
cccan
you
um
access
the
mayor's
files
good
yes
because
clearly
we
uh
we
need
to
take
a
harder
look
at
him
he's
he's
um
he's
obviously
up
to
something
i
don't
know
i
need
time
which
means
that
faith
will
be
soon
on
her
way
back
to
england
to
face
the
watcher's
council
most
likely
they'll
lock
her
away
for
a
good
long
while
you
let
her
get
away
buffy
that's
enough
so
she
saved
you
she
opted
to
come
back
to
town
with
you
that
that
bodes
well
she
still
has
a
lot
to
face
before
she
can
put
this
behind
her
then
i
think
she
stands
a
chance
