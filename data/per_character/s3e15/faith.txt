into
it
if
he

new
watcher

second
word
bait
uh
yep

ready
to
kick
a
little
bad
guy
butt
so
you
gonna
rat
me
out
is
that
it
oh
i
see
but
you
can
pretend
that
angel's
still
dead
when
you
need
to
protect
him
worse
than
jail
for
the
rest
of
my
young
life
no
way
yeah
we
you
were
right
there
beside
me
when
this
whole
thing
went
down
anything
i
have
to
answer
for
you
do
too
you're
a
part
of
this
b
all
the
way
i'm
telling
you
we
did
the
world
a
favor
this
guy
was
about
as
interesting
as
watching
paint
dry
i'm
joking
jeez
lighten
up
a
little
b
he
came
out
of
nowhere
whatever
i'm
not
lookin'
to
hug
and
cry
and
learn
and
grow
i'm
just
saying
it
happened
quick
you
know
you
know
what
let's
just
blow
who
cares
what
this
guy
was
about
it's
kind
of
moot
now
don't
you
think
so
what
you
think
there's
some
big
conspiracy
so
his
papers
are
gone
that
doesn't
prove
anything
so
the
mayor
of
sunnydale
is
a
black
hat
that's
a
shocker
huh
when
are
you
gonna
learn
b
it
doesn't
matter
what
kind
of
vibe
you
get
off
a
person
'cause
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
face
they're
showing
you
is
not
the
real
one
what
is
that
supposed
to
mean
do
you
so
fill
me
in
'cause
i'd
like
to
hear
this
is
there
gonna
be
an
intermission
in
this
no
we're
not
bringing
anybody
else
into
this
you
gotta
keep
your
head
b
this
is
all
gonna
blow
over
in
a
few
days
if
it
doesn't
they
got
a
freighter
leaving
the
docks
at
least
twice
a
day
it
ain't
fancy
but
it
gets
you
gone
buffy
i'm
not
gonna
see
anything
i
missed
the
mark
last
night
and
i'm
sorry
about
the
guy
i
really
am
but
it
happens
anyway
how
many
people
do
you
think
we've
saved
by
now
thousands
and
didn't
you
stop
the
world
from
ending
because
in
my
book
that
puts
you
and
me
in
the
plus
column
why
not
the
guy
i
offed
was
no
gandhi
i
mean
we
just
saw
he
was
mixed
up
in
dirty
dealings
what
if
he
was
you're
still
not
seeing
the
big
picture
b
something
made
us
different
we're
warriors
we're
built
to
kill
we
are
better
that's
right
better
people
need
us
to
survive
well
that's
your
loss
just
hanging
no
i
was
with
my
friend
buffy
some
old
movie
witnesses
yeah
that
whoever
did
it
wasn't
hip
to
the
bronze
age
you
mean
am
i
covering
for
someone
hardly
i'm
not
the
throw
myselfonthesword
type
it's
okay
buffy
i
told
him
i
had
to
he
had
to
know
what
you
did
um
sorry
what
i'm
sick
of
people
asking
me
that
for
one
thing
like
you
could
make
something
happen
if
i
didn't
want
it
to
five
minutes
clock
is
running
so
then
go
talk
to
buffy
she's
the
one
who
killed
a
guy
version
no
the
important
part
is
that
buffy
is
the
accidental
murderer
and
you're
living
proof
of
that
aren't
you
you'd
dig
that
wouldn't
you
to
get
up
in
front
of
all
your
geek
pals
and
go
on
record
about
how
i
made
you
my
boy
toy
for
a
night
i
know
what
this
is
all
about
you
just
came
by
here
'cause
you
want
another
taste
don't
you
more
like
how
then
lights
on
or
off
you
wanna
feel
a
connection

just
skin

want
i
take
i
forget
i
could
do
anything
to
you
right
now
and
you
want
me
to
i
can
make
you
scream
i
could
make
you
die
finally
decided
to
tie
me
up
huh
i
always
knew
you
weren't
really
a
oneslayer
guy
the
thing
with
xander
i
know
what
it
looked
like
but
we
were
just
playing
safety
words
are
for
wusses
you
gonna
shrink
me
now
is
that
it
that's
what
they
all
say
and
then
it's
just
'lemme
stay
the
night
won't
try
anything'
angel

wanna
go
the
long
way
around
hey
i
can
do
that
i'm
not
getting
any
older

seems
to
have
a
theory
yeah
sounds
like
you
need
some
help
a
professional
maybe
goody
for
you
if
we're
gonna
party

get
on
with
it
otherwise
could
you
let
me
out
of
these
things
right
now
all
i
feel
is
a
cramp
in
my
wrist
so
let
me
go

i
hope
evil
takes
mastercard
what
whatever
have
to
disagree
with
you
on
that
one
now
unlock
these
or
i'll
pop
this
guy's
head
like
a
grape
don't
even
think
about
it
wrong
again
wes
you
don't
give
up
do
you
yeah
because
you
and
me
are
such
solid
buds
right
for
me
to
change
and
be
more
like
you
you
mean
scares
you
doesn't
it
but
that's
not

your
gut
we
don't
need
the
law

exactly
what
i'm
about
'cause
you
have
it
in
you

got
the
lust
and
i'm
not
just
talking
about
screwing
vampires
it
was
good
wasn't
it
the
sex
the
danger
bet
a
part
of
you
even
dug
him
when
he
went
psycho
see
you
need
me
to
toe
the
line
because
you're
afraid
you'll
go
over
it
aren't
you
b
you
can't
handle
watching
me
living
my
own
way
having
a
blast
because
it
tempts
you
you
know
it
could
be
you
there's
my
girl

feels
good
blood
rising
you
sent
your
boy

guess
that
means

have
a
job
opening
