you
have
much
anger
and
pain
your
magic
is
strong
but
your
pain
—
it's
like
a
scream
that
pierces
dimensional
walls
we
heard
your
call
our
intention
is
not
to
quash
your
potential
—
quite
the
contrary
the
pain
and
suffering
you
brought
upon
those
you
love
is
inspiring
you
are
ready
to
join
us
here
in
arash
ma'har
but
you
did
this
is
the
result
of
your
power
you
will
make
a
fine
vengeance
demon
it
is
not
my
concern
you
are
my
interest
in
this
matter
that
is
your
answer
