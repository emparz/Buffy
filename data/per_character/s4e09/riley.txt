looks
good
oh
hey
buffy
what
oh
yes
—
i
am
a
lesbian
oh
hey
you
know
how
we
were
talking
about
having
a
picnic
i
was
thinkin'
—
do
you
ever
hang
out
at
rhode's
field
it's
beautiful
there
usually
not
that
crowded
either
i
thought
maybe
we
could
have
a
little
spread
—
sandwiches
maybe
some
ants
it'll
be
fun
so
was
that
a
conversation
i
actually
had
or
one
i
was
just
practicing
okay
yes
—
i
have
been
known
to
do
a
little
prep
work
before
our
conversations
it's
not
easy
you
know
talking
to
you
sometimes
it's
like
an
oral
exam
well
you're
tricky
i
never
know
how
you're
going
to
react
to
something
that's
why
i
like
you
so
much
you're
a
mystery
probably
every
beautiful
girl
in
the
world
has
some
jerk
telling
her
she's
a
mystery
but
i
swear
you
really
are
there's
a
lot
about
you
that
needs
puzzling
out
i
loose
you
somewhere
hey
—
don't
you
just
love
a
picnic
yeah
well
not
fourwheeling
or
anything
but
yeah
don't
you
you're
kidding
right
i
mean
you
know
how
to
drive
it's
just
because
you
haven't
had
a
good
experience
yet
you
can
have
the
best
time
in
a
car
it's
not
about
getting
somewhere
you
have
to
take
your
time
forget
about
everything
just
relax
let
it
wash
over
you
the
air
motion
just
let
it
roll
thought
i
was
i'm
taking
you
some
night
when
it's
warm
up
past
the
vineyards
—
it's
going
to
change
everything
for
you
hey
willow
wait
sit
there's
plenty
to
go
around
yeah
i
guess
they
do
that
hey
buffy
what's
up
um
yeah
they're
nice
a
little
dressy
maybe
for
school
but
buffy
different
than
what
the
day
when
the
wedding
what
wedding
i
don't
think
no
is
a
strong
enough
word
no
can
we
start
again
i
just
need
to
clear
a
few
things
up
buffy
who
what's
his
name
the
groom
that's
a
name
i'm
not
mad
no
i
am
er
i
really
wow
who
is
this
guy
does
he
go
here
old
okay
it's
late
and
i'm
i'm
very
tired
now
so
i'm
just
gonna
go
far
away
and
be
away
no
stay
well
no
um
you
weren't
serious
maybe
we
haven't
known
each
other
that
long
i
did
not
have
fear
in
my
eyes
so
you
decided
to
tell
me
you're
getting
married
so
you're
insane
but
you're
still
single
okay
then
just
another
little
piece

the
buffy
puzzle
you're
gonna
teach
me
