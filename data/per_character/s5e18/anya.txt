i
don't
see
why
we
have
to
patrol
just
'cause
buffy's
away
i'd
rather
stay
home
and
watch
television
oh
i
was
there
it
really
wasn't
that
bad
see
if
you
were
really
a
witch
you
could
do
a
spell
to
escape
so
really
it
was
only
bad
for
the
falsely
accused
and
well
they
never
have
a
good
time
fine
thank
you
for
asking
you're
back
very
early
you're
right
i
breathed
in
like
a
quart
of
vampire
dust
that
can't
be
good
oh
you
know
slayerwatcher
stuff
probably
some
silly
ritual
with
an
enchanted
prairie
dog
or
something
she
fought
okay
that's
true
buffy's
boinking
spike
sometimes
in
the
movies
when
they
go
crazy
they
slap
'em
oh
xander
i
was
scared
are
you
hurt
what
happened
ooh
the
big
guns
saddling
up
shouldn't
we
have
guns
and
maybe
change
your
clothes
you
know
something
more

fighty
what
do
we
do
with
glory
which
is
kind
of
thrown
by
the
you
having
sex
with
spike
okay
that's
denial
that
usually
comes
before
anger
anger
she's
very
well
done
we
were
getting
weapons
well
even
if
he
told
her
he'd
just
lie
to
us
about
it
anyway
right
uch
looks
very
complicated
in
there
personally
i'd
rather
look
at
guts
