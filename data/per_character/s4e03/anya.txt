you
should
lock
your
door
i
need
to
talk
to
xander
go
away
xander
come
with
me
your
mother
said
you
were
working
here
where
is
our
relationship
going
relationship
what
kind
do
we
have
and
what
is
it
progressing
toward
yeah
we
went
to
the
prom
i
can't
stop
thinking
about
you
sometimes
in
my
dreams
you're
all
naked
so
i
can
assume
a
standing
friday
night
date
and
a
mutual
recognition
as
prom
night
as
our
dating
anniversary
okay
how
you're
mother
sent
me
around
from
the
front
of
the
house
she
said
to
ask
you
to
add
fabric
softener
when
the
timer
goes
off
can
we
talk
some
more
yeah
alright
at
point
the
matter
is
brought
to
a
conclusion
with
both
parties
satisfied
and
able
to
move
on
with
their
separate
lives
and
interests
to
sum
up
i
think
it's
a
workable
plan
sexual
intercourse
i've
said
it
like
a
dozen
times
i
think
it's
the
secret
to
getting
you
out
of
my
mind
putting
you
behind
me
behind
me
figuratively
i'm
thinking
face
to
face
for
the
actual
event
itself
oh
i
have
condoms
some
are
black
i
like
you
you're
funny
and
you're
nicely
shaped
and
frankly
it's
ludicrous
to
have
these
interlocking
bodies
and
not
interlock
please
remove
your
clothing
now
fabric
softener
so
i'm
over
you
now
okay
xander
i
was
looking
for
you
you
weren't
in
your
musty
basement
no
about
what
happened
i
said
i
was
over
you
