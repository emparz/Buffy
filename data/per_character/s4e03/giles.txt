me
i'm
kicking
myself
the
gem
of
amara
are
you
sure
it's
uh
the
vampire
equivalent
of
the
holy
grail
the
source
of
some
enormous
power
was
conveniently
vague
oh
here
it
is
yes
there
was
a
great
deal
of
vampiric
interest
in
locating
it
during
the
uh
oh
the
10th
century
questing
vampires
combed
the
earth
but
no
one
ever
found
anything
it
was
concluded
that
it
never
existed
yes
well
i'll
research
it
as
best
i
can
you've
done

i'm
sincerely
relieved
to
hear
that

we
discuss
the
impending
disaster
a
text
it
refers
to
the
gem
of
amara
as
residing
in
the
valley
of
the
sun
it
seems
that
spike
may
know
what
it's
about
the
gem
may
exist
after
all
in
sunnydale
in
a
sealed
underground
crypt
i'll
get
started
right
oz
there
are
more
important
things
than
records
right
now

suppose
an
argument
could
be
made
for

i
ah
uh
uh
public
television
come
on
everyone
we
have
vital
work
to
do
watching
television

buffy
and
meet
us
there
harmony
where's
spike

he
had
the
gem
where

also
very
dangerous
and
we're
destroying
it
well
buffy
any
vampire
that
gets
his
hand
on
this
is
going
to
be
essentially
unlikable
oh
buffy
