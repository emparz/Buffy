how
could
carl
do
that
to
me
that
bastard
but
with
my
sister
she's
not
even
pretty
she's
fat
he
cheated
on
me
with
my
fat
ugly
sister
he
said
he
loved
me
but
we
anya
they
say
i
love
you
and
and
you
think
it's
true
they
say
oh
anya
i
want
to
be
with
you
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
and
you
believe
them
you
believe
they
feel
the
same
way
about
you
because
that's
the
way
love's
supposed
to
be
right
who's
anya
men
suck
i
wish
carl's
flesh
would
anya
and
you
know
he
said
it
isn't
me
but
how
can
i
believe
him
i
mean

he
knew
he
didn't
want
to
get
married
deep
down
he
knew
but
he
lied
to
me
every
day
for
months
i
wish
anya
he
lied
and
lied
and
then
lied
some
more
'cause
hey

who's
gonna
notice
with
all
the
other
lies
flying
around
like
little
monkeys
and
then
he
thinks
he
can
just
sweep
the
carnage
underneath
the
rug
by
saying

oh
cut
to
some
sort
of
underground
cavern
a
looming
shapeless
shadow
moves
across
the
wall
