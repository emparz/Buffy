after
the
moon
went
down
there
was
plenty
of
magic
wanna
get
up
oh
she
still
isn't
back
i'm
sure
she'll
be
okay
no
i
mean
she
told
me
they've
been
sleeping
together
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
say
anything
but
i
i
promised
her
i
wouldn't
i
think
she
was
afraid
of
the
look
you'd
get
on
your
face
kinda
like
the
one
you're
wearing
now
so
is
she
probably
we've
been
kinda
busy
maybe
we
didn't
hear
her
come
home
oh
hey
we're
better
than
good
so
um
nerds
how
are
them
they
um
this
might
take
a
while
what
about
anya
she
might
be
able
to
help
with
some
of
the
demon
texts
these
things
take
time
we'll
figure
it
out
finally
get
out
of
bed
what
is
it
to
what
maybe
we
can
crossreference
them
with
the
county
clerk's
office
eventually
what
about
the
trio's
evil
scheme
it
isn't
written
in
any
ancient
language
we
could
identify
um
this
um
banks
armored
car
routes
corporate
vaults

this
is
big
it's
time
sensitive
better
not
get
used
to
'em
mmmm
xander
no
he's
here
i
hope
so
that's
the
best
part
your
shirt
