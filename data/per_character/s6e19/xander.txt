hey
i
think
there's
still
a
cold
one
in
the
fridge
with
your
boyfriend
i
know
why
anya

i
understand
i
do
but
you
all
those
times
i
told
spike
to
get
lost

that
he
didn't
have
a
chance
with
a
girl
like
you
what
lying
to
me
you
could
have
told
me
so
you
went
to
him
instead
it
used
to
be
oh
like
uh
say
you're
evil
get
on
me
but
i
never
forgot
what
he
really
is
god
what
were
you
thinking
i'm
not
saying
i
didn't
make
any
mistakes
but
last
time
i
checked
slaughtering
half
of
europe
wasn't
one
of
them
he
doesn't
have
a
soul
buffy
just
some
leash
they
jammed
in
his
head
you
think
he'd
still
be
all
snuggles
if
that
chip
ever
stopped
working
would
you
still
trust
him
with
dawn
then
yeah
there's
a
lot
of
that
going
around
it's
a
good
thing
i'm
part
fish
the
part
with
the
hook
in
it
yeah
but
then
there'd
be
the
flopping
and
the

gasping
and

sure
maybe
it'd
work
out
but
chances
are
i'd
up
and
leave
you
at
the
helm
in
your
white
dress
then
find
you
spawning
with
another
fish
who
turns
out
to
be
spawning
my
very
good
friend
night
and
day
behind
my
back
then
comes
the
fighting
and
again
with
the
flopping
and
the
gasping
'cause
hey

chicken
of
the
sea
here's
not
doing
too
good
with
the
women
these
days
sorry
i'm
just
looking
to
curl
up
with
the
quiet
alone
tonight
see
now
i
think
it's
the
daddy
thing
that's
throwing
her
'cause
incest

not
that
sexy
so
uh
why
don't
we
leave
the
ladies
to
their
impending
nausea
and
move
the
freakshow
outside
whaddaya
say
well
at
least
i
know
how
to
get
one
buffy
i
found
warren
this
what
you
call
not
seeing
spike
anymore
he
pauses
as
he
sees
buffy
she's
sitting
on
the
floor
looking
very
upset
what
did
he
do
did
he
hurt
you
son
of
a
bitch
it's
klingon
they're
love
poems
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
insidious
scheme
you're
about
to
describe
spree
anyone
be
careful
warren's
gone
all
mighty
mouse
emphasis
on
the
might
time
for
the
spring
poking
already
the
sinister
yet
addictive
card
game
you'll
find
him
he
won't
be
much
good
without
his
friends
how
did
we
get
here
the
past
few
weeks
i
thought
i
hit
bottom
but

it
hurt
that
you
didn't
trust
me
enough
to
tell
me
about
spike
it
hurt
maybe
you
would
have
if
i
hadn't
given
you
so
many
reasons
to
think
i'd
be
an
ass
about
it
i
think
i've
got
you
beat
not
so
much
buffy
sweet
fancy
moses
where
the
hell
did
he
xander
stops
looking
to
his
left
pan
quickly
over
to
buffy
lying
on
the
ground
on
her
back
staring
upward
oh
god
oh
god
buffy
buffy
buffy
