oh
that's
good
uh
i'm
in
florence
italy
i've
rented
a
scooter
that's
parked
outside
and
i'm
in
a
little
restaurant
eating
ziti
and
there
are
no
more
tables
left
so
they
have
to
seat
this
guy
with
me
and
it's
john
cusack
'cause
with
the
ziti
you
never
come
up
with
anything
new
do
you
think
giles
ever
played
'anywhere
but
here'
when
he
was
in
school
feel
the
passion
coughing
not
speaking
can't
you
just
imagine
them
getting
together
and
the
abacus
aw
you
miss
your
friends
but
tea
right
no
i'm
not
gonna
get
close
enough
to
feel
his
pulse
but
he
looks
dead
now
there's
something
you
don't
see
everyday
i'll
try
the
'net
but
'mark
of
eyghon'
sounds
like
giles
and
his
books
sorta
deal
ah
aha
it's
not
egyptian
it's
etruscan
mistaken
for
egyptian
by
the
design
pattern
but
any
fool
can
see
it
predates
their
iconology
look
the
mark
of
eyghon
worn
by
his
initiates
'eyghon
also
called
the
sleepwalker
can
only
exist
in
this
reality
by
possessing
an
unconscious
host
temporary
possession
imbues
the
host
with
a
euphoric
feeling
of
power'
buffy
yeah
but
what
about
nontemporary
'unless
the
proper
rituals
are
observed
the
possession
is
permanent
and
eyghon
will
be
born
from
within
the
host'
cordelia
i'm
guessing
eww
wait
hey
listen
'once
called
eyghon
can
also
take
possession
of
the
dead
but
its
demonic
energy
soon
disintegrates
the
host
and
it
must
jump
to
the
nearest
dead
or
unconscious
person
to
continue
living'
buffy
i
still
don't
get
what
this
has
to
do
with
giles
i
don't
know
about
giles
but
ancient
sects
used
to
induce
possession
for
bacchanals
and
and
orgies
did
you
find
anything
that's
giles
we
have
to
figure
out
how
to
kill
this
thing
and
we
need
to
do
it
fast
hey
we
don't
have
time
for
this
our
friends
are
in
trouble
now
we
have
to
put
our
heads
together
and
and
get
them
out
of
it
and
if
you
two
aren't
with
me
a
hundred
and
ten
percent
then
get
the
hell
out
of
my
library
okay
now
we've
done
the
research
we
just
have
to
figure
out
how
to
use
it
well
that
won't
kill
the
demon
it'll
only
give
it
a
change
of
scenery
oh
oh
oh
i've
got
it
i've
got
it
no
trust
me
this
is
gonna
work
and
it
jumped
i
wasn't
sure
it
was
gonna
work
oh
no
i
don't
think
i
could
handle
the
stress
i
don't
see
how
giles
does
it
