he
was
acting
well
very
antigiles
he

interested
in
joining
your
club
i'm
gonna
kill
you
will
that
blow
the
whole
karma
thing
ethan
listen
to
me
this
is
a
bad
idea
you're
dealing
with
something
very
dangerous
no
no
you
knew
that
if
the
demon
was
in
trouble
it
was
gonna
jump
into
the
nearest
dead
person
winner
and
still
champion
darn
i
really
wanted
to
hit
him
till
he
bled
you
know
what
the
worst
thing
is
i
was
saving
up
for
some
very
important
shoes
and
now
i
have
to
blow
my
entire
allowance
to
get
this
stupid
tattoo
removed
let's
just
hope
my
mom
doesn't
see
it
first
but
it
did
hey
maybe
you
should
consider
a
career
as
a
watcher
i
don't
think
he
has
a
choice
hey
is
she
okay
i'm
sorry
to
hear
that
i
think
maybe
you
should
i'm
not
gonna
lie
to
you
it
was
scary
i'm
so
used
to
you
being
a
grownup
and
then
i
find
out
that
you're
a
person
who
would've
thought
so
after
all
this
time
we
finally
find
out
that
we
do
have
something
in
common
which
apart
from
being
a
little
weird
is
kind
of
okay
i
think
we're
supposed
to
be
training
right
now
and
you
know
what
i
have
just
the
perfect
music
go
on
say
it
you
know
you
want
to
there
feel
better
