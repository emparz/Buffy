notice
an
empty
aluminum
can
on

reacts

with
a
stake
buffy
throws
up
her
arms
and

stake
from

man's
hands
and
raises
it
to
counter
attack
he
steps
back
and

white
cross
hanging
from

neck
swings
around

of
his
attire
buffy
sees
that
it's
xander
and
stays
her
attack
xander
is
taken
completely
by
surprise
and
just
stares
