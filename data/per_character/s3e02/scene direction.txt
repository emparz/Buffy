over
to
her
closet
and
dumps
them
in

turns
around
and
looks
at
the
room
that
she's
missed
so
much
for
the
last
few
months
it
all
seems
so
familiar
and
yet
not
certainly
it's
too
neat
and
clean
she
reaches
into
her
closet
for
a
sweater
and
heads
over
to
her
mother's
room
joyce

very
startled
and
jumps
accidentally
slamming
the
hammer
through
the
drywall
buffy
cringes
at
the
sight
of
the
hole
in
the
wall
her
mother
pulls
the
hammer
out
and
turns
to
face
her
smiling
while
still
holding
the
hammer
in
one
hand
the
mask
in
the
other
joyce
smiles
she
looks
down
at
the
mask
in
her
hand
and
turns
around
to
hang
it
on
the
wall
over
the
hole
it's
carved
from
a
reddish
wood
with
cutouts
for
eyes
which
are
slanted
inward
to
appear
very
evil
there
are
a
series
of
long
pointed
teeth
with
extra
long
fangs
for
incisors
set
into
the
upper
lip
there
is
no

portion
joyce
hangs
the
mask
on

again
glances
around
the
room
i

cheers
up
the
room
buffy
looking
at
the
mask
joyce
nods
joyce
sees
that
buffy
is
holding
a
sweater
buffy
looks
down
at
the
sweater
buffy
smiles
weakly
joyce
goes
to
her
dresser
joyce
grabs
her
keys
joyce
looks
down
at
her
keys
briefly
joyce
inhales
deeply
have
a
good
time
she
smiles
and
gives
her
mom
a
nervous
little
wave
then
leaves
the
room
buffy
lowers
the
stake
buffy
shakes
it
at
him
he
breathes
hard
trying
to
catch
his
breath
he
looks
at
her
trying
to
convince
himself
that
it's
really
her
and
finally
manages
a
weak
smile
suddenly
a
vampire
smashes
his
way
out
of
a
crate
leaning
against
a
wall
he
lunges
at
xander
and
buffy
knocking
them
and
himself
to
the
pavement
xander
quickly
tries
to
grab
the
vampire
as
he
gets
up
but
the
demon
grabs
xander
instead
and
pulls
him
up
he
draws
his
fist
back
for
a
punch
but
buffy
jumps
in
and
hits
the
vampire
in
the
stomach
with
a
powerful
side
kick
making
him
fall
backwards
into
a
pile
of
trashcans
and
bags
cordelia's
voice
comes
over
the
walkietalkie
at
xander's
belt
buffy
taken
aback
the
vampire
is
back
on
his
feet
and
comes
at
them
he
tackles
xander
and
sends
him
reeling
backwards
into
a
chain
link
fence
buffy
tries
to
stake
him
but
he
sidesteps
her
and
shoves
her
into
the
fence
as
well
xander
tries
to
come
up
behind
him
but
the
vampire
swings
out
with
a
backhand
fist
to
xander's
face
knocking
him
to
the
ground
buffy
gets
to
her
feet
and
sweep
blocks
two
punches
from
the
demon
she
high
clocks
his
third
punch
and
gets
a
hand
under
his
chin
to
hold
him
at
bay
he
pushes
her
back
into
the
fence
as
the
two
struggle
for
control
now
willow
cordelia
and
oz
come
running
the
two
girls
grab
the
vampire
by
the
arms
and
drag
him
off
of
buffy
and
across
the
alley
slamming
him
hard
into
a
steel
rollup
door
buffy
catches
her
breath
as
she
looks
on
in
astonishment
the
vampire
growls
at
the
girls
as
oz
tries
to
move
in
with
a
stake
but
the
vamp
roundhouse
kicks
oz
sending
him
to
the
pavement
next
to
xander
he
then
shoves
cordelia
away
and
buffy
quickly
moves
to
catch
her
so
she
won't
get
hurt
the
vampire
then
throws
willow
aside
and
she
falls
onto
xander
and
oz
cordelia
recognizes
buffy
pushes
her
aside
and
wields
back
her
stake
when
she
sees
the
vampire
come
after
them
cordelia
loses
her
balance
and
falls
to
the
pavement
next
to
willow
buffy
plunges
her
stake
cleanly
into
the
vampire
and
he
bursts
into
ashes
as
the
dust
settles
down
she
looks
over
at
her
friends
staring
up
at
her
from
the
ground
they
are
all
breathing
hard
buffy
gives
them
a
little
wave
and
a
weak
smile
they
just
keep
staring
back
