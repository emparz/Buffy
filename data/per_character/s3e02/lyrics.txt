you
can
send
me
a
savior
buffy
this
is
large
that
lives
till
the
end
of
time
buffy
yeah
it's
great
ii
was
just
sort
of
hoping
it
would
be



us
time
willow
sorry
what
the
promise
of
heaven
buffy
this
is
amazing
but
i
was
sort
of
hoping
we
could
just
hang
together
the
gang
but
that
only
leaves
me
dry
willow
indicates
to
the
band
and
makes
like
she
totally
can't
hear
buffy
she
turns
her
attention
back
to
oz
and
smiles
at
him
dry
buffy
senses
that
willow
is
more
into
watching
oz
play
with
the
band
than
anything
else
at
the
moment
and
decides
to
leave
her
alone
too
many
saviors

and
i
won't
die
after
walking
a
ways
back
into
the
crowd
buffy
changes
her
mind
deciding
that
she
wants
to
talk
to
willow
now
i
never
cried
but
i
needed
more
from
you
she
touches
willow
on
the
arm
and
indicates
they
should
go
someplace
to
talk
willow
lets
buffy
lead
her
away
through
the
crowd
i
found
my
life
without
you
now
buffy
finds
a
relatively
quiet
spot
in
the
dining
room
where
they
can
talk
and
i
never
mind

i'm
only
half
as
blind
buffy
is
everything
okay
cause
i
needed
more
from
you
buffy
you



you
seem
to
be
avoiding
me
iin
the
oneonone
sense
and
i
never
mind
willow
this
isn't
avoiding
see
here
you
are
here
i
am
i'm
only
half
as
blind
buffy
so
we're
cool
cause
i
needed
more
from
you
willow
way
that's
why
with
the
party
'cause
we're
all
glad
you're
back
you
say
my
reflection
never
fades
from
your
eyes
cut
to
joyce's
bedroom
the
mask's
eyes
begin
to
glow
a
deep
red
again
i
got
another
rope
over
me

but
i
won't
hang

i
can
feel
you
covet
my
faith
cut
to
xander
and
cordelia
sucking
some
serious
face
by
the
stairs
i
said
another
lie

i
know
why

i
don't
wanna
sway
buffy
comes
walking
out
of
the
crowd
and
sees
them
she
tries
to
walk
by
without
being
noticed
but
xander
sees
her
cordelia
doesn't
stop
kissing
him
on
the
face
and
neck
while
he
talks
to
buffy
i
don't
wanna
sway
xander
some
kind
of
party
huh
i
guess
a
lot
of
people
are
glad
to
have
you
back
seize
these
worlds

or
never
live
again
xander
uh
he
was
library
man
last
time
i
saw
him
but
he'll
be
here
he
wants
to
celebrate
your
homecoming

all
do
i
mean
it's
great
to
have
the
buffster
back
seize
these
worlds
xander
isn't
it
or
never
live
again
cordelia
except
you
were
kinda
turning
me
on
with
that
whole
boy
slayer
look
you
know
i
roll
it
over
in
my
head
a
guy
reaches
in
front
of
her
and
grabs
a
handful
of
party
mix
leans
his
head
back
and
dumps
it
into
his
mouth
most
of
it
spills
to
the
sides
and
onto
the
floor
i
won't
feel
you
covet
my
faith
buffy
just
gives
a
shrug
grabs
a
few
more
cups
and
turns
to
go
throw
them
out
she
passes
two
guys
talking
and
overhears
their
conversation
you've
said
another
lie

know
why

don't
wanna
sway
buffy
stares
at
them
less
than
happy
about
that
rumor
but
she
ignores
them
and
continues
on
toward
the
kitchen
i
don't
wanna
sway

to
the
kitchen
joyce

having
a
little
