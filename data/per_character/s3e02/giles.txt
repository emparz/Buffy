some
information

the
dead'
americans
jesus

a
bloody
bicycle
cordelia
it's
me
it's
me
cordelia
do
stop
being
tiresome
that
makes
sense
it's
the
mask
in
joyce's
bedroom
they're
after
the
mask
holds
the
power
of
a



zombie
demon
called
ovu
mobanievil
eye
i
don't
think
we
can
get
past
them
if
one
of
them
puts
it
on
they
become
the
demon
incarnate
yes
worse
out
back
tell
buffy
mobani's
power
lies
in
his
eyes
she
has
to
go
for
the
eyes
to
defeat
him
i'd
like
to
have
a
word
with
you
you
can't
keep
her
out
of
this
school
you
had
no
grounds
for
expelling
her
buffy
summers
is
a
minor
and
is
entitled
to
a
public
education
your
personal
dislike
of
the
girl
does
not
legally
entitle
you
to
i
thought
i'd
start
with
the
state
supreme
court
you're
powerful
in
local
circles
but
i
believe
i
can
make
life
very
difficult
for
you
professionally
speaking
and
buffy
will
be
allowed
back
in
would
you
like
me
to
convince
you
