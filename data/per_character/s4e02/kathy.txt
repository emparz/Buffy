i
know
this
song
is
super
fun
isn't
it
going
out
oh
it's
late
won't
you
be
up
all
night
i
guess
i
just
didn't
realize
you'd
be
coming
and
going
at
all
hours
well
not
that
i
mind
i'm
just
surprised
oh
say
buffy
i
wanted
to
show
you
this
little
system
i
implemented
just
log
every
call
you
make
in
here
and
that
way
when
the
bill
comes
it
won't
be
a
problem
i
figure
'stitch
in
time'
also
i
noticed
that
some
of
my
milk
was
missing
did
you
no
it's
totally
ok
i
was
just
wondering
buffy
it's
fine
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
that
we
didn't
have
a
thief
or
something
i
don't
know
it's
no
big
deal
please
feel
free
have
a
good
time
hey
i
caught
you
oh
everything's
super
i
just
decided
a
decaf
latte
sounded
like
heaven
after
all
why
not
this
way
you
won't
have
to
walk
these
spooky
paths
alone
this
is
neat
isn't
it
the
fresh
air
the
trees
the
smell
of
what
the
blizzard
was
that
all
about
what
were
you
thinking
taking
him
on
like
that
i
mean
it's
just
you
could
of
gotten
hurt
or
something
and
look
at
my
sweater
it's
ruined
hi
everybody
squeeze
in
i
didn't
think
you'd
mind
i
mean
you
got
mine
all
muddy
it's
not
a
problem
is
it
i
mean
i
figured
we're
almost
like
sisters
now
living
together
and
everything
nebraska
originally
don't
forget
to
log
those
calls
ewww
who
left
their
gum
here
it
wasn't
me
it
had
to
be
somebody
buffy
do
you
always
make
that
noise
when
you
sleep
you
can
read
dreams
neat
ditto
maybe
you
could
read
the
dream
i
had
last
night
there
was
like
this
monster
and
he
sat
on
me
and
did
all
this
stuff
to
me
that's
it
how'd
you
know
hmm
hmm
sounds
like
somebody
woke
up
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
bed
this
morning
you
know
i
do
need
to
dash
my
whole
schedule
is
off
because
someone
kept
me
up
all
night
well
it's
been
fun
toodles
that's
so
totally
true
parker
was
just
going
to
leave
his
number
and
go
but
we
started
talking
he's
such
a
blast
and
time
just
flew
quit
it
i
told
you
that
was
just
between
us
bye
seeya
it
wouldn't
have
killed
you
to
be
nice
you
know
i
wasn't
moving
in
on
your
territory
if
that's
what
you
mean
i'm
cold
do
you
know
what
your
problem
is
buffy
hardly
your
problem
is
you're
spoiled
maybe
the
world
revolved
around
you
where
you
used
to
live
but
it's
share
time
now
oh
jeez
i
do
what
i
can
but
buffy's
difficult
she's
secretive
for
one
thing
she
comes
in
at
all
hours
of
the
night
she
leaves
her
gum
all
over
the
place
i
would
but
she
is
so
touchy
about
all
kinds
of
weird
stuff
i
mean
sometimes
i
get
the
feeling
that
she
is
not
quite
normal
you
know
later
ok
yeah
that's
what
she
wants
you
to
think
sure
where's
buffy
what
do
you
mean
i
should
leave
the
room
why
should
i
go
you
bet
it's
not
fair
having
to
live
with
someone
who's
obviously
troubled
someone
who
so
clearly
needs
to
be
in
a
home
not
in
a
dorm
i
wouldn't
put
it
past
her
to
drop
out
or
take
off
or
something
do
something
horrible
to
herself
or
worse
she's
capable
of
it
you
know
you
can
see
it
in
those
shifty
little
eyes
of
hers
one
of
these
days
she
might
even
push
somebody
too
far
hello
it's
oz
buffy
absolutely
let's
talk
huh
look
what
i
did
quit
it
oh
why
don't
you
just
stuff
it
and
let
me
finish
my
ritual
i'm
sorry
ok
i
left
my
dimension
to
go
to
college
and
they
sent
these
guys
after
me
so
i'm
borrowing
yours
tonight
when
they
come
looking
for
me
they'll
take
the
one
without
a
soul
and
i
won't
have
to
live
with
a
slob
it's
share
time
buffy
all
you
had
to
do
was
write
down
your
calls
the
window's
open
happy
open
up
let
me
finish
how
did
you
do
i'm
not
going
back
i'm
3000
years
old
when
are
you
going
to
stop
treating
me
like
i'm
900
