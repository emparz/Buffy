gotta
respect
the
driveby
no
question
he'll
be
back
hey
kath
well
actually
the
worst
part
i'd
have
to
go
with
the
demon
poring
the
blood
down
your
throat
stuff
like
scorpions
and
bloody
mary
minus
the
mary
well
i'm
a
good
guesser
which
could
also
be
construed
as
the
brain
thing
well
she's
definitely
pushing
the
stress
meter
on
this
kathy
thing
hits
the
red
zone
you're
worried
about
her
well
i'm
against
it
well
i
can
do
that
well
i'm
not
saying
we'll
braid
each
others
hairprobablyâ€”but
i
can
hang
with
her
watch
for
signs
she's
going
over
the
edge
so
either
you
hit
her
or
you
did
your
wacky
mime
routine
for
her
nobody
deserves
a
mime
buffy
forced
to
wear
a
binding
unitard
just
here
to
help
seemed
more
interesting
than
homework
not
in
question
just
a
just
a
thought
buffy
but
do
you
think
all
this
ranting
is
scaring
away
potential
demons
on
the
plus
side
you've
killed
the
bench
which
was
looking
shifty
agreed
shh
don't
engage
then
we'd
better
go
over
there
and
check
'em
yeah
buffy's
got
a
pretty
good
lead
on
us
though
leaving
xander
and
me
to
help
buffy
in
the
flesh
