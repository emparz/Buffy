hello
and
jump
and
bend
and
occasionally
frolic
congratulations
you've
found
me
out
i'm
a
mod
jogger
buffy
what
sort
of
demon
translate
thank
you
anything
else
you
took
your
roommate
patrolling
with
you
right
well
we
should
discourage
her
from
that
habit
from
what
you
described
ii'm
not
familiar
with
the
creature
but
ii'll
look
into
it
and
give
you
a
ring
when
i've
found
something
yes
i
take
my
tea
out
here
sometimes
uh
it's
a
good
day
for
me
actually
a
friend
of
mine
recently
acquired
auh
an
original
gutenberg
demonography
and
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
you've
never
once
asked
me
what
my
day's
plans
were
which
leads
me
to
inquire
whether
you're
feeling
entirely
yourself
and
it's
appreciated
which
doesn't
explain
why
you're
hanging
around
here
instead
of
rushing
off
as
usual
ah
i
see
buffy
living
with
somebody
is
never
easy
especially
for
an
only
child
which
is
fussy
i
agree
but
everybody
has
their
idiosyncrasies
you'd
do
well
to
learn
to
tolerate
them
something
like
that
buffy
ok
you
know
what
you're
right
take
a
mental
pic
this
is
the
new
buffy
kinder
gentler
roommate
extraordinaire
perhaps
it
would
be
more
productive
to
examine
your
dreams
um
determine
there
meaning
nice
to
meet
you
kathy
you
know
what
this
means
buffy
focus
please
if
kathy
and
you
are
having
the
same
nightmares
chances
are
something
happened
to
you
both
when
you
met
the
demon
in
the
woods
i
concur
she's
not
uh
herself
but
you
know
uh
learning
to
live
with
someone
can
be
a
challenge
right
then
nothing
to
get
to
concerned
about
still
let
me
know
if
she
um
yes
we're
doing
this
to
stop
you
from
making
a
terrible
mistake
clearly
something
is
amiss
i
fear
the
demon
that
buffy
met
in
the
woods
has
somehow
possessed
her
um
you
stay
and
watch
her
ii
know
a
spell
that
will
make
the
possessing
demon
reveal
itself
so
that
we
can
fight
it
but
ii
need
to
get
some
supplies
from
the
magic
shop
buffy
i
see
you
around
'the
ritual
of
mok'tagar
a
race
of
transdimensional
demons
involves
the
forced
ingestion
of
animal
blood
while
the
victim
slumbers'
buffy's
nightmares
'but
while
the
mok'tagar
can
assume
many
forms
and
guises
including
human
they
can
always
be
recognized
by
others
of
their
kind
due
to
the
lack
of
a
soul'
toenails
buffy
was
right
kathy's
toenails
not
only
keep
growing
after
they've
been
cut
they
actually
regenerate
after
they've
been
destroyed
oh
unequivocally
yes
so
where
is
buffy
oh
dear
we
have
even
less
time
than
i
feared
i've
looked
up
all
known
regenerating
demons
only
one
species
practices
the
ritual
buffy's
been
seeing
in
her
sleep
it's
used
to
steal
the
soul
from
a
human
body
i
believe
so
yes
excuse
me
please
now
i've
found
a
spell
that
should
reverse
the
soul
transfer
procedure
immediately
willow
and
i
will
perform
it
at
once
'hear
me
elders
of
the
upper
reaches
elders
of
the
lower
reaches
elders
of
the
dry
land
elders
of
the
river
flats'
'ancients
i
beseech
you
the
soul
abstracted
let
it
revert
to
it's
true
seat'
'let
it
be
finished
let
the
unnatural
vessel
be
emptied
let
the
essence
be
returned
to
it's
original
host'
