i
think
that
was
the
last
thank
you
i
wish
i
knew
most
of
my
sources
have
dried
up
since
the
uh
council
has
relieved
me
of
my
duties
i
was
aware
there
was
a
nest
here
but
quite
frankly
i
expected
it
to
be
vampires
these
these
are
new
yes
i'm
sorry
i
should've
had
you
better
prepared
and
i
should
never
have
allowed
willow
and
uh
and
uh
i
expect
we
can
leave
them
i'm
more
interested
in
finding
out
what
they
are
and
whether
we
can
expect
more
of
their
kind
uh
xander
i
think
in
the
future
perhaps
it
would
be
best
if
you
you
uh
hhung
back
to
the
rear
of
the
battle
you
know
for
your
own
sake
hmm
sorry
the
end
of
the
world
they
seem
fairly
committed
the
sisterhood
of
jhe
is
an
apocalypse
cult
they
exist
solely
to
bring
about
the
world's
destruction
and
we've
not
seen
the
last
of
them
more
will
follow
buffy
this
is
no
laughing
matter
i'm
sorry
i
know
i'm
no
longer
your
official
watcher
but
um
yyou're
cutting
it
a
bit
close
i
think
so
based
on
some
artifacts
i
i
found
with
them
and
um
taking
into
account
the
current
astral
cycle
they
intend
to
open
the
hellmouth
about
twenty
feet
from
where
you're
standing
the
council
wouldn't
even
take
my
calls
idiots
anything
useful
in
the
books
fine
um
to
try
and
contact
the
spirit
guides
they
exist
out
of
time
but
have
knowledge
of
the
future
i
have
no
idea
if
they
will
respond
to
my
efforts
but
i
have
to
try
all
we
know
is
that
the
fate
of
the
entire
world
rests
on
it
did
you
eat
all
the
jellies
i
always
have
a
jelly
i'm
always
the
one
that
says
'let's
have
a
jelly
in
the
mix'
willow
we're
sorry
buffy
had
three
no
matter
if
xander
makes
another
run
noli
me
renuere
umbra
ducens
sapienta
manium
super
me
effundatur
belua
propulsanda
est
invenire
vitium
suum
noster
spes
sola
est
oh
uh
i
was
just
trying
to
uh
gain
access
to
the
um
spirit
guides
not
going
very
well
i'm
afraid
uh
what
are
you
doing
here
hmm
oh
no
thank
you
uh
probably
best
if
you
you
stay
out
of
trouble
there's
something
different
about
this
menace
something
in
the
air
the
stench
of
death
we
may
all
be
called
upon
to
fight
when
it
happens
i
better
go
um
hopefully
we
shall
have
time
to
prepare
all
we
need
is
a
few
weeks
it's
the
hellmouth
he
can
sense
it's
going
to
open
be
ready
just
in
case
now
don't
hesitate
now
oz
again
we've
got
to
move
him
before
he
wakes
up
terra
vente
ignis
et
pluvia
cuncta
quattuor
numina
vos
obsecro
defendete
nos
a
recente
malo
resoluto
anywhere
is
safer
than
here
um
help
me
with
the
candles
yes
but
once
it's
ready
you're
to
stay
back
and
let
me
finish
the
recitation
don't
argue
i
want
you
safe
who
knows
what's
going
to
come
up
from
beneath
us
oh
my
god
it's
grown
omnia
vasa
veritatis
now
buffy
yes
stupidest
but
the
world
continues
to
turn
no
thank
you
