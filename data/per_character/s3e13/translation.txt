spirit
guide
let
the
wisdom
of
those
who
have
passed
be
showered
upon
me
these
secrets
belong
to
time
and
the
dark
regions
to
reveal
them
would
bring
chaos
down
upon
the
living
earth
the
beast
must
be
fought
our
only
hope
lies
in
finding
its
weakness
seek
not
disturb
us
no
longer
earth
wind
fire
and
rain
linger
four
gods
we
implore
you
defend
us
immediately
after
i
will
release
you
all
things
the
vessel
of
truth
