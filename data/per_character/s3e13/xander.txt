i'm
good
we're
fine
just
a
little
bit
dirty
good
show
everyone
just
great
i
think
we
have
a
hit
tiptop
really
if
anyone
sees
my
spine
laying
around
just
try
not
to
step
on
it
excuse
me
who
at
a
crucial
moment
distracted
the
lead
demon
by
allowing
her
to
pummel
him
about
the
head
i
think
you'll
find
that
was
more
of
a
bellow
i
say
bring
'em
on
but
gee
mr
white
if
clark
and
lois
get
all
the
good
stories
i'll
never
be
a
good
reporter
jimmy
olsen
joke

much
gonna
be
lost
on
you
huh
hey

okay
hey
doug

lesman

open
les
buddy
doug
right
here

sorry
doug's
arm

kinda
like
spaghetti
we're
all
so
very
sad
for
him
is
your
lunch
okay
no
no
i
had
to
take
that
test
when
i
was
seven
a
little
slow
in
some
stuff
mostly
math
and
spatial
relations
but
certainly
not
challenged
or
anything
can
i
get
you
another
soda
hey
hey
whoa
whoa
whoa
it
was
an
accident
what
starting
something
like
that
michael
jackson
song
right
that
was
a
lot
of
fun
'too
high
to
get
over
yeah
yeah'
remember
that
fun
song
i
could've
taken
him
why
is
it
that
i've
come
facetoface
with
vampires
demons
the
most
hideous
creatures
hell
ever
spit
out
and
i'm
still
afraid
of
a
little
bully
like
jack
o'toole
why
am
i
surprised
by
how
comforting
you're
not
i
was
just
talking
to
hey
mind
your
own
business
i
happen
to
be
an
integral
part
of
that
group
i
happen
to
have
a
lot
to
offer
i
do
but
it's
just
that
it's
buggin'
me
this
'cool'
thing
i
mean
what
is
it
how
do
you
get
it
who
doesn't
have
it
and
who
decides
who
doesn't
have
it
what
is
the
essence
of
cool
i
mean
you
yourself
oz
are
considered
more
or
less
cool
why
is
that
is
it
about
the
talking
you
know
the
way
you
tend
to
express
yourself
in
short
noncommittal
phrases
i
know
you're
in
a
band
that's
like
a
businessclass
ticket
to
cool
with
complementary
mojo
after
takeoff
i
gotta
learn
an
instrument
is
it
hard
to
play
guitar
okay
but
on
the
other
hand
eighth
grade
i'm
taking
the
fl√ºgelhorn
and
gettin'
zero
trim
so
the
whole
instrument
thing
could
be
a
mislead
but
you
need
a
thing
one
thing
nobody
else
has
what
do
i
have
now
with
the
mocking
which
i
can
handle
because
i
know
i'm
right
about
this
i'm
on
the
track
i
just
need
to
find
my
thing
you
girls
need
a
lift
what
do
you
mean
what
is
it
it's
my
thing
my
thing
it's
my
thing
that
makes
me
cool
you
know
that
makes
me
unique
i'm
car
guy
guy
with
the
car
uncle
rory
stacked
up
the
duis
let
me
rent
this
bad
boy
till
he's
mobile
again
could
you
sound
a
little
less
enthused
big
then
we'll
handle
it
together
you
know
i'm
here
for
you
just
tell
me
what
i
can
do
i'll
take
two
glazed
two
cinnamon
couple
creamfilled
and
a
jelly
no
no
let's
round
that
out
to
four
jellies
cordelia
feel
free
to
drop
dead
of
a
wasting
disease
in
the
next
twenty
seconds
i'm
kinda
busy
right
now
okay
you
think
you
know
everything
that's
a
laugh
why
uh
yes
it
is
uh
very
possibly
like
a
dream
about
warm
sticky
things
would
you
like
to
go
for
a
little
drive
just
gotta
drop
this
stuff
off
and
then
i
would
describe
myself
as
angel
buddy
friendbuddy
you
wanna
sit
and
talk
library
last
i
saw
the
apocalypse
they're
on
top
of
it
let's
go
there
and
tell
them
that
but
i
can
help
y'know
it's
not
like
i
haven't
helped
before
y'know
i've
done
some
quality
violence
for
those
people
do
they
even
think
about
that
i
mean
they
act
like
i'm
like
i'm
some
sorta
klutz
oh
god
are
you
alright
oh
god
stay
calm
little
fender
bender
it's
not
the
end
of
the
world
oh
gosh
jack
man
are
are
you
okay
i
am
really
sorry
about
that
but
your
car
came
out
of
nowhere
exactly
look
i
can
cover
the
damages
i
don't
have
insurance
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
word
but
i
have
a
little
money
the
important
thing
is
that
we're
alright
and
we
can
work
this
out
like
two
reasonable
frontiersmen
what
i'm
fairly
certain
i
don't
want
it
at
all
but
uh
thank
you
yeah
great
knife
although
i
think
uh
it
may
technically
be
a
a
sword
you
gave
it
a
girl's
name
how
very
serial
killer
of
you
listen
i
think
we
should
be
going
would
that
make
you
happy
mostly
i
feel
katie
again
katie's
springing
to
mind
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
who
has
the
big
sharp
oh
gee
i'm
really
sorry
my
lifeanddeath
situation
isn't
exciting
enough
for
you
no
just
blowing
off
steam
two
guys
rasslin'
but
not
in
a
gay
way
what

in
mind
what
about
your
car
great
where
to

should
just
let
you
guys
catch
up
howdy

all
your
friends
dead
i'm
sensing
that
giles
hey

goin'
on
oh
we
were
just
raising
um
listen
do
you
guys
need
any
help
no
chance
of
that
yeah
i
think
it's
bob
when
what
happens
exactly
if
you
guys
want
me
to
drop
you
off
somewhere
that's
uh
this
time
of
night
i'm
pretty
sure
nothing's
open
but
they're
always
open
for
crime
okay
now
i'm
involved
in
crime
i'm
the
criminal
element
having
a
car
sure
is
cool
will
nothing
certainly
not
crime
whwhat
about
you
and
that
thing
that's
happening
would
be
okay
that's
it
i'm
gonna
look
something's
just
come
up
no
it's
just
i'm
kinda
busy
great
i
wanna
be
in
the
gang
sure
what
do
i
gotta
do
alright
guys
what
let's
just
talk
about
this
yes
yes
but
i'm
not
dying
to
be
in
the
gang
if
you
get
the
um
the
pun
there
what
about
jack
jack's
not
dead
oh
boy
alright
enough
you
guys
have
had
your
fun
but
you
forgot
about
one
thing
i'd
say
that's
pretty
much
enough
excitement
for
one
evening
get
in
you
think
demon
mama
followed
us
really
pop
oh
i'm
up
i'm
suddenly
very
up
it's
just
um
those
two
concepts
are
antithetical
did
i
mention
that
i'm
having
a
very
strange
night
hey
they're
not
baking
any
cake
long
gone
probably
loaded
with
supplies
gotta
think
i
can't
believe
i
had
sex
okay
bombs
hey
i've
got
this
um
there's
this
uh
it's
probably
a
bad
time
can
i
help
okay
okay
i
can
work
this
out
i
just
got
to
figure
out
what
they'd
be
likely
to
bomb
giles
will
know
what
to
do
he's
way
more
calm
than
buffy
okay
i
got
a
plan
where's
the
bomb
in
the
school
where
alright
now
i'm
gonna
ask
you
this
once
and
you
better
pray
you
get
the
answer
right
how
do
i
defuse
i
probably
should've
left
out
that
whole
middle
part
where's
a
slayer
when
you
need
one
should've
learned
by
now
if
you're
gonna
play
with
fire
you
gotta
expect
sooner
or
later
i
wasn't
finished
note
to
self
less
talk
okay
boiler
room
other
way
hello
nasty
less
than
two
minutes
dumb
guy
little
bomb
i'm
not
leaving
till
that
thing's
disarmed
you
gonna
do
all
that
in
fortynine
seconds
i
know
what
you're
thinkin'
can
i
get
by
him
get
up
the
stairs
out
of
the
building
seconds
ticking
away
i
don't
love
your
chances
yeah
looks
like
so
i
guess
the
question
really
is
who
has
less
fear
yeah
but
this
is
different
being
blowed
up
isn't
walking
around
and
drinking
with
your
buddies
dead
it's
little
bits
being
swept
up
by
a
janitor
dead
and
i
don't
think
you're
ready
for
that
i
like
the
quiet
good
boy
i
don't
think
i
wanna
be
seeing
you
on
campus
anymore
jack
guys
well
uh
gimme
the
quiet
life
i'm
gonna
grab
a
snack
anyone
want
oz
okay
