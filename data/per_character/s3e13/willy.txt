before
sunrise
that's
what
they
said
they
were
looking
for
angel
said
they
were
coming
after
you
too
and
nothing
could
stand
in
their
way
because
tonight
was
the
night
oh
man
look
kid
my
clientele
ain't
exactly
nuns
and
orphans
but
i
i
never
seen
anything
like
these
demons
that
hellmouth
opens
they're
gonna
be
the
least
of
your
problems
is
my
train
of
thought
if
i
were
you
i'd
go
find
angel
go
somewhere
quiet
together
i'd
be
thinking
about
how
i
wanna
spend
my
last
night
on
earth
