so
we
think
school
events
are
stupid
and
we
think
authority
figures
are
to
be
made
fun
of
and
we
think
our
afternoon
classes
are
optional
all
three
of
you
left
campus
yesterday
fighting
real
antisocial
types
you
need
to
integrate
into
this
school
people
i
think
i
just
found
three
eager
new
participants
for
the
talent
show
i've
been
watching
you
three
always
getting
into
one
scrape
or
another
my
predecessor
mr
flutie
may
have
gone
in
for
all
that
touchyfeely
relating
nonsense
but
he
was
eaten
you're
in
my
world
now
and
sunnydale
has
touched
and
felt
for
the
last
time
i
know
the
three
of
you
will
come
up
with
a
wonderful
act
for
the
school
to
watch
and
mock
and
laugh
at
kids
today
need
discipline
that's
an
unpopular
word
these
days
'discipline'
i
know
principal
flutie
would
have
said
'kids
need
understanding
kids
are
human
beings'
that's
the
kind
of
woollyheaded
liberal
thinking
that
leads
to
being
eaten
this
place
has
quite
a
reputation
suicide
missing
persons
spontaneous
cheerleader
combustion
you
can't
put
up
with
that
you've
gotta
keep
an
eye
on
the
bad
element
like
those
three
kids
i
don't
like
them
from
now
on
you're
gonna
see
a
very
different
sunnydale
high
tight
ship
clean
orderly
and
quiet
what
are
you
doing
school
hours
are
over
you
therefore
should
be
gone
there
are
things
i
will
not
tolerate
students
loitering
on
campus
after
school
horrible
murders
with
hearts
being
removed
and
also
smoking
there's
something
going
on
with
you
i'll
figure
it
out
sooner
or
later
do
you
need
something
here
mmhmm
get
along
home
now
it's
late
looking
for
something
you
know
with
everything
that's
been
going
on
recently
i'm
not
sure
how
safe
it
is
for
a
girl
like
yourself
to
be
here
alone
alright
then
