hey
there's
something
about
you
that's
causing
me
to
hug
you
it's
like
i
have
no
will
of
my
own
mm
we
got
back
late
sort
of
very
the
band
we
had
a
gig
in
monterey
sunday
night
i
thought
you
did
didn't
figure
you
for
missing
school
i'd
call
that
a
radical
interpretation
of
the
text
we're
playing
tonight
at
the
bronze
if
you
get
done
early
well
other
bands
know
more
than
three
chords
your
professional
bands
can
play
up
to
six
sometimes
seven
completely
different
chords
hey
man
you
looking
for
buffy
well
no
sightings
as
of
yet
but
i
think
she
said
she'd
show
that
doesn't
look
good
well
he
lacks
credibility
can
you
get
outta
here
i
think
we
need
some
backup
ten
to
one
could
get
pointless
get
buffy
do
it
now
willow
you
don't
wanna
do
this
who
did
this
to
you
devon

on
