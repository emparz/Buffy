there's
a
chair
in
my
head
on
which
i
used
to
sit

took
a
pencil
and
i
wrote
the
following
on
it

now
there's
a
key
where
my
wonderful
mouth

used
to
be
evil
willow
enters
and
looks
around
the
place
is
calm
especially
compared
to
what
she's
used
to
people
are
hanging
out
chatting
drinking
playing
pool
only
a
few
eyes
notice
her
in
her
black
leather
dig
it
up
throw
it
at
me

dig
it
up
throw
it
at
me
evil
willow
stops
by
a
pool
table
and
looks
forlornly
all
around
taking
in
the
situation
where
can
i
run
to

where
can
i
hide

who
will
i
turn
to

now
i'm
in
the
virgin
state
of
mind
a
guy
in
a
leather
jacket
can't
help
but
notice
evil
willow
as
she
walks
around
him
staring
appraisingly
at
him
with
her
evil
scowl
she
just
keeps
going
he
doesn't
want
anything
to
do
with
her
got
a
knife
to
disengage
the
voids
that
i
can't
bear

cut
out
words
i've
got
written
on
my
chair

like
do
you
think
i'm
sexy

and
do
you
think
i
really
care
evil
willow
begins
to
get
depressed
about
how
things
suddenly
are
she
doesn't
watch
where
she's
going
and
neither
does
percy
who
bumps
into
her
