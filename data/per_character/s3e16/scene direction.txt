whips
open
her

surprised
by
how
powerful
this

actually
is

sees
scenes
from
an
alternate

suddenly
she
disappears
from

scene
willow
flashes
back
to
the
classroom
where
she
has
a
wideeyed
look
of
surprise
and
shock
on
her
face
the
pillar
of
energy
fades
and
she
pulls
back
her

overhears
that
and

she
leaves
the

anya
looks
down
at
the
plate
frustrated
then
picks
it
up
anya
anguished
anya
smashes
it
she's
standing
in
the
street
disoriented
and
confused
by
everything
she
sees
around
her
there
are
so
many
people
and
children
boldly
walking
and
running
around
at
night
without
a
care
in
the
world
to
her
it's
all
strange
very
strange
these
people
should
be
cowering
in
their
homes
not
out
enjoying
themselves
as
she
walks
along
the
yellow
centerline
some
people
walk
by
her
crossing
the
street
from
the
theater
to
the
espresso
pump
coming
within
reaching
distance
blissfully
unaware
of
who
she
is
no
one
fears
her
no
one
even
notices
her
behind
her
she
hears
a
girl
screaming
and
turns
to
look
but
the
girl
is
just
resisting
some
teasing
from
her
boyfriend
not
shaking
in
fear
of
a
vampire
an
old
woman
approaches
her
not
even
put
off
by
her
full
leather
attire
evil
willow
faces
her
and
snarls
the
lady
is
frightened
and
she
backs
away
shaken
but
she's
not
terrified
as
evil
willow
would
have
expected
probably
assuming
she
was
just
another
punk
she
rolls
her
eyes
and
continues
percy
recognizes
her
surprised
then
amused
percy
points
at
her
percy
smugly
she
raises
her
eyes
and
looks
at
him
with
weary
amusement
she
shoves
the
heel
of
her
hand
squarely
into
his
chest
sending
him
flying
onto
a
pool
table
he
lands
hard
on
his
back
and
his
momentum
forces
him
into
a
back
roll
off
of
it
several
guys
around
them
are
shocked
evil
willow
now
has
the
attention
of
the
crowd
as
she
slowly
goes
over
to
percy
evil
willow
pensively
she
reaches
down
and
lifts
percy
up
from
the
floor
by
his
throat
digging
her
fingertips
into
his
flesh
and
choking
him
evil
willow
expectantly
percy
tries
to
punch
her
but
she
idly
blocks
him
and
looks
up
into
his
eyes
sadly
at
first
but
then
with
a
wide
grin
when
percy
can't
pull
her
hand
off
he
clutches
her
neck
with
his
other
hand
and
tries
to
choke
her
some
guys
in
the
background
make
fun
of
percy
unaware
of
the
seriousness
of
his
situation
xander
comes
up
behind
him
eager
to
get
in
on
the
fun
the
guys
laughingly
point
over
at
evil
willow
and
percy
who
have
both
hands
around
each
other's
necks
now
percy
is
choking
while
evil
willow
just
continues
to
smile
xander
runs
up
behind
percy
and
yanks
him
off
of
her
throwing
him
to
the
floor
percy
panicked
percy
scrambles
away
xander
turns
back
to
make
sure
willow
is
okay
but
is
stunned
by
the
way
she's
dressed
for
her
part
evil
willow's
face
brightens
glad
to
finally
see
a
familiar
face
evil
willow
thrilled
xander
amazed
evil
willow
smiles
widely
she
hugs
him
running
her

sensuously
over
his
neck
and
back
xander
her
hands
go
further
down

glares
at

of

with
disgust
she
has
nothing

evil
willow
starts
away
buffy
goes
after
her
she
grasps
evil
willow's
arm
from
behind
and
turns
her
around
and
is
dumbfounded
when
she
sees
her
in
her
vampire
guise
evil
willow
roars
she
shakes
the
slayer
off
and
stalks
away
leaving
buffy
and
xander
standing
there
in
complete
shock
and
dawning
horror
evil
willow
stops
and
smiles
to
herself
in
anticipation
he
nudges
his
partner
to
attack
evil
willow
does
a
side
kick
at
him
sending
him
stumbling
back
alfonse
lunges
at
her
but
she
grabs
onto
his
shoulder
and
uses
his
momentum
to
flip
him
to
the
ground
she
turns
around
and
does
a
halfspinning
hook
kick
to
the
other
one's
head
he
backs
up
a
step
but
keeps
his
balance
and
leans
back
in
to
punch

willow
she
middle
blocks
two
shots
and
follows
up
with
a
punch
to
his
head
she
grabs
his
shoulder
while

dazed
and
flips
him
over
onto
his
back

comes
at

again
and
she
connects
with
a
roundhouse
kick
to

he
falls
but
gets
up
quickly
and
grabs
her
shoulder
she
grabs
onto
his
hand
to
keep
it
in
place
and
with
her
other
hand
she
pushes
down
on

shoulder
forcing
him
to
flip
forward
onto
his
back
she
takes
his
hand
and
jerks
it
back
hard
snapping
his

grunts
in

and

reprovingly
she
brushes
her
fingers
against

intrigued
alfonse
hoarsely
with
a

she
takes
one
of

there
willow
curiously
they
all
look
up
surprised
xander
lifts
his
cross
in
defense
willow
notices
their
sad
faces
and
is
amazed
at
their
expressions
she
notices
just
how
deeply
sad
they
really
are
and
realizes
she
may
have
gotten
it
right
willow
almost
panicked
xander
jumps
up
and
gets
in
willow's
face
with
the
cross
she
doesn't
cower
from
it
but
instead
shows
deep
concern
for
him
thinking
maybe
he's
flipped
out
or
something
xander
shakes
the
cross
as
though
it
were
broken
and
puts
it
back
in

puzzled
without
any
further
hesitation
buffy
runs
the
two
steps
to
her
best
friend
and
hugs
her
hard
and
close
willow
is
surprised
and
lets
out
a
little
groan
from
the
tightness
of
the
embrace
an
instant
later
xander
is
also
hugging
her
for
all
he's
worth
willow
wonderingly
the
hug
goes
on
for
a
long
moment
before
it
gets
too
intense
for
willow
they
both
let
go
smiling
at
her
with
tears
in
their
eyes
she
smiles
back
but
still
doesn't
know
what
to
make
of
it
all
before
she
can
finish
she
finds
herself
being
warmly
embraced
again
by
the
normally
reserved
watcher

things
are
looking
dire
for
willow
on
stage
buffy
runs
to
her
aid
smashing
the
cue
into
the
back
of
a
vampire's
head
along
the
way
and
breaking
it
resulting
in
a
sharp
makeshift
stake
she
leaps
up
onto
the
stage
and
is
about
to
stab
down
hard
with
it
into
evil
willow's
back
with
it
when
willow
shouts
out
to
stop
her
willow
urgently
buffy
reacts
instantly
holding
back
just
short
of
penetration
and
instead
grabs
evil
willow
and
yanks
her
roughly
away
from
willow
restraining
her
securely
angel
is
finished
with
his
fight
also
and
hops
up
onto
the
stage
as
well
evil
willow
realizes
that
she
is
now
outnumbered
willow
stands
up
and
gingerly
massages
her
neck
willow
admiringly
buffy
shrugs
gracefully
evil
willow
to
willow
sadly
willow
surprised
empathetically
giles

finish
setting
up
for
the
spell
to
send
evil
willow
back
giles
lights
the
candles
xander
steps
over
to
evil
willow
but
cautiously
not
getting
too
close
angel
keeps
a
wary
eye
on
her
from
behind
people
afraid
of
me
evil
willow
just
looks
askance
at
him
then
rolls
her
eyes
and
turns
away
xander
steps
away
chortling
gleefully
oz
stands
up
and
walks
behind
willow
and
buffy
who
are
observing
evil
willow
buffy
uncertainly
evil
willow
checks
on
angel
behind
her
willow
penitently
buffy
regretfully
willow
hesitantly
buffy
understandingly
willow
resolutely
willow
goes
over
to
evil
willow
giles
to
anya
warningly
anya
sulkily
anya
arrogantly
contemptuous
both
willows
roll
their
eyes
and
shake
their
heads
at
her
delusions
of
grandeur
giles
unimpressed
giles
gestures
where
they
should
kneel
willow
faces
evil
willow
for
the
last
time
willow
helpfully
evil
willow
doesn't
display
any
emotion
but
willow
smiles
warmly
at
her
and
gives
her
a
big
hug
evil
willow
isn't
sure
what
to
make
of
that
but
gets
into
the
spirit
and
does
some
naughty
touching
willow
jumps
back
from
her
reach
willow
shocked
evil
willow
gives
her
a
naughty
knowing
smile
the
two
of
them
walk
over
to
join
the
circle
they
kneel
down
as
the
camera
pulls
back
the
screen
fades
to
white
and
then
returns
to
the
ongoing
fight
in
the
alternate
universe
evil
willow
materializes
and
smiles
relieved
to
be
back
in
her
own
reality
only
to
be
suddenly
grabbed
by
oz
and
shoved
back
onto
a
broken
piece
of
the
wooden
cage
effectively
impaling
her
through
the
heart
evil
willow
miserably
she
explodes
into
ashes
the
screen
flashes
back
to
white
and
back
to
sunnydale
high
the
camera
pans
down
to
willow
and
buffy
sitting
together
on
a
wall
willow
sadly
buffy
sagely
percy
comes
up
to
them
a
bit
nervous
percy
interrupts
percy
hands
it
to
her
he
hands
her
the
other
one
both
are
nicely
bound
in
folders
buffy
gives
willow
a
knowing
smile
willow
just
stares
at
him
in
stunned
amazement
percy
respectfully
percy
hands
it
to
her
willow
is
speechless
amazed
by
his
sudden
change
in
attitude
he
starts
to
go
but
comes
back
to
lay
an
apple
on
the
folders
in
her
lap
he
leaves
again
hopping
athletically
over
a
low
wall
buffy
innocently
willow
