a
vampire
out

looks
like
me
oh
right

and
oz
play
'mistress

uh
oh
oh
oops

just
can't
get
more
disturbing
ack
ew
no
more
you're
really
starting
to
freak
me
out
ow
it's
horrible
that's
me
as
a
vampire
i'm
so
evil
and
skanky
and
i
think
i'm
kinda
gay
who
wouldn't
be
it's
a
little
binding
i
guess
vampires
really
don't
have
to
breathe
gosh
look
at
those
me
screaming
don't
worry
i
won't
do
anything
that
could
be
interpreted
as
brave
hi
i'm
back
yep
i
did
i
killed
her
and
sucked
her
blood
as
we
vampires
do
you
know
i
think
maybe
i
heard
something
out
there
why
don't
you
go
check
i
don't
like
that
you
dare
question
me
maybe
i'll
have
my
minions
take
you
out
back
and
kill
you
horribly
she
bothered
me
she's
so
weak
and
accommodating
she's
always
letting
people
walk
all
over
her
and
then
she
gets
cranky
with
her
friends
for
no
reason
i
just
couldn't
you
know
he's
been
gone
for
a
while
why
don't
you
go
check
on
him
i
don't
know
if
i
feel
like
killing
anymore
i'm
so
bored
iit
would
be
like
shooting
fish
in
a
barrel
where's
the
fun
maybe
we
should
let
everyone
go
and
give
them
a
thirty
second
head
start
no
i
like
my
plan
okay
let's
get
to
the
killing
why
don't
we
start
with
her
this
girl
has
a
history
of
mental
problems
dating
back
to
early
childhood
i'm
a
bloodsucking
fiend
look
at
my
outfit
a
human
oh
yeah
could
a
human
do
this
ow
ow
ow
happy
but
ow
no
more
snuggles
buffy
no
nice
reflexes
you
noticed
that
too
i
just
can't
kill
her
i
mean
i
know
she's
not
me
we
have
a
big
nothing
in
common
but
still
we
send
her
back
to
her
world
and
she
stands
a
chance
it's
the
way
it
should
be
anyway
good
luck
try
not
to
kill
people
hands
hands
strangely
i
feel
like
staying
at
home
and
doing
my
homework
and
flossing
and
dying
a
virgin
between
me
and
my
evil
self
i've
got
double
guilt
coupons
i
see
now
where
the
path
of
vice
leads
i
mean
she
messed
up
everything
she
touched
i
don't
ever
want
to
be
like
that
oh
hi
listen
i
didn't
have
a
chance
900
sound
good
