me
that

woman
with
you
locked
up
what
could
we
talk
about
oh

how
about
the
ethics
of
boyfriend
stealing
and
okay
it
isn't
even
like
i
was
that
attracted
to
xander
it
was
more
just
that
we
kept
being
put
in
these
life
or
death
situations
and
that's
always
all
sexy
and
stuff
i
mean
i
more
or
less
knew
he
was
a
loser

that
doesn't
make
it
okay

come
around

have
something
on
my
neck

i
getting
a
zit

think
of
a
way
