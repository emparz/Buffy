trade
ya
for
a
carton
of
cigarettes
and
some
soap
sorry
habit
shouldn't
you
be
down
at
hogwarts
all
right
playin'
hooky
score
one
for
the
boarding
school
brat
anya's
technique's
probably
a
little
different
than
what
you're
used
to
yeah
whenever
she
starts
talking
about
getting
all
sweaty
with
xander
like
that
i
just
remind
her
i
had
him
first
shuts
her
right
the
hell
up
no
one's
come
up
with
any
info
on
caleb
yet
whatcha
got
incidents
of
violence
and
vandalism
connected
to
california
religious
institutions
in
the
last
10
years
looks
like
this
gives
us
a
place
to
start
hey
pipsqueak
why
don't
you
go
get
some
of
the
stuff
you've
already
gotten
from
giles
yeah
sounded
like
there
was
news
maybe
in
the
meantime
the
troops
here
gotta
sit
and
stew
feeling
crappier
by
the
minute
yeah
i
know
how
to
keep
them
occupied
hey
hey
how
old
are
you
yeah
we're
gonna
get
you
a
real
nice
7up
ok
hey
i
was
wondering
what
was
taking
you
boys
so
long
where
you
been
yeah
or
we
could
try
this
one
on
instead
how
'bout
you
guys
buy
me
another
drink
and
we
see
where
the
evening
takes
us
it's
cool
i
got
it
it's
nothin'
get—get
off
me
i
tell
you
right
now
i'm
not
goin'
back
to
jail
just
blowing
off
steam
well
it
started
that
way
turned
when
the
cops
went
evil
on
us
they
needed
a
break
all
right
they've
been
running
themselves
into
the
ground
things
just
got
out
of
hand
seemed
like
a
good
idea
at
the
time
they
didn't
no
one
got
hurt
b
look
you
don't
even
know
these
girls
maybe
you
should
have
a
little
more
confidence
in
'em
let
them
mess
up
sometimes
you
know
get
down
and
dirty
how
the
hell
else
are
they
gonna
learn
they're
not
children
yeah
what
about
the
vineyard
how
safe
were
they
when
you
dragged
them
off
to
meet
caleb
how
safe
was
rona
or
amanda
or
molly
god
i
hope
so
you
must
be
principal
wood
heard
a
lot
about
you
troops
are
still
gathering
i
think
you're
safe
yeah
cops
mostly
yeah
this
one's
from
someone
who
just
thinks
she's
a
cop
it's
my
favorite
of
all
my
current
bruises
i'm
not
gonna
kill
her
wanted
to
but
didn't
by
the
way
bully
for
me
since
no
one
else
said
it
it's
this
new
thing
i'm
tryin'
believe
every
word
other
things
matter
more
i
think
you
need
to
brush
up
on
your
buffy
and
faith
history
you
uh
live
around
here
right
this
town
walking
anywhere
after
dark
is
like
an
extreme
sport
someone
who
didn't
know
you
very
well
might
think
you
were
out
lookin'
for
a
fight
or
something
maybe
you
got
bigger
issues
than
what's
wrong
with
b
i
read
people
too
xander's
home
or
in
the
alternative
how
'boutwe
don't
i
mean
it's
a
neat
theory
b
but
i'm
not
going
back
in
that
place
not
without
proof
and
neither
should
you
and
neither
should
they
maybe
it
ends
ok
the
way
you
wanna
play
it
but
maybe
it
doesn't
and
right
now
i
don't
think
i
want
you
playin'
the
odds
listen
we're
fighters
all
of
us
but
you
gotta
give
me
something
to
fight
something
real
not—
what
whoa
whoa
whoa
so
not
what
i
meant
i'm
not
in
charge
chick
i
think
b
here
needs
to
justchill
out
for
a
little
bit
take
a
siesta
or
something
but
i'm
not
the
one
you
want
learn
their
names
you
have
no
idea
what
i'm
feeling
i
didn't
come
here
to
take
anything
away
from
you
but
i'm
not
gonna
be
your
little
lapdog
either
i
came
here
to
beat
the
other
guy
to
do
right
however
it
works
i
don't
know
if
i
can
lead
but
the
real
question
iscan
you
follow
hey
look
i
swear
i
didn't
want
it
to
go
this
way—
i
mean
it
i—
