umno
you
got
enough
to
share
probably
thing
is—
what's
the
point
studying
demon
hot
zones
and
pressure
points
doesn't
do
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
good
when
preacher
man's
out
there
ready
to
finish
the
job
he
started
we're
lousy
with
dead
ends
around
here
everyone's
feeling
pretty
pointless
we
don't
even
have
a
place
to
start
his
ability
to
render
a
slayer
useless
in
just
one
punch
i
didn't—
that
was
stupid
i
don't
know
why
i
said
that
i
really
didn't
mean—
yeah
we
were
we
probably
should
head
down
there
now
what
kind
of
band
plays
during
an
apocalypse
what's
going
on
you're
gonna
have
to
shoot
us
all
to
stop
us
we
didn't
have
time
to
do
more
you
have
to
pretend
there's
a
big
party
here
well
that's
how
it
feels
to
us
people
are
dying
why
are
you
always
standing
up
for
her
maybe
we
need
a
vote
to
see
who
wants
faith
to
have
a
turn
in
charge
no
what
