oh
no
no
i
ccan't
you
can't
fight
him
you
can't
stop
him
you
can
only
run
i'll
do
better
i'll
show
you
one
night
some
time
ago
a
man
arrived
at
our
doors
we
areâ€”we
are
a
benevolent
order
and
yes
we
welcomed
him
we
offered
to
feed
him
but
he
had
come
for
something
else
behind
this
he
revealed
something
even
we
didn't
know
was
here
a
secret
room
he
was
excited
talking
the
whole
time
destiny
that
sort
of
thing
he
was
going
on
about
this
ancient
inscription
he
read
it
and
he
didn't
like
what
it
said
his
temper
he
was
the
purest
evil
i've
ever
seen
he
burned
his
mark
upon
me
and
then
i
ran
and
i
hid
and
i
listened
to
the
others
die
