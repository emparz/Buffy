ah
thank
you
officer
we—we
appreciate
your
help
um
i
think
it's
time
we
were
catching
our
flight
to
um
interpol
oh
same
as
everyone
the
hellmouth
is
active
again
i
don't
see
anything
then
why
is
it
in
the
file
oh
not
sure
here
shut
up
pay
attention
dawn
what
do
you
see
on
the
back
wall
a
knothole
amanda
would
you
go
down
to
the
basement
and
get
spike
spike
i
have
a
mission
for
you
this
is
bona
fide
with
real
ramifications
take
a
look
at
this
i
need
someone
who
can
take
care
of
themselves
in
case
caleb
has
left
some
souvenirs
take
andrew
there
may
be
demons
lurking
about
you
never
know
he's
a
demon
expert
he
can
help
well
he
can
bring
his
pan
flute
thing
along
excellent
off
you
go
buffy
are
you
hurt
my
god
is
hhe—
uhuh
yes
very
much
so
i
think
um
there's
evidence
that
caleb
may
have
established
a
foothold
up
north
i
um
i
sent
spike
to
look
into
it
yes
i
sent
andrew
with
him
buffy
you
weren't
here
decisions
have
to
be
made
in
your
absence
i
did
what
i
thought
was
right
we're
all
watching
your
back
buffy—
what
umfaith
thought
that
the
girls
could
do
with
some
time
off
their
studies
i—i
thoughtshe
took
them
to
the
bronze
windmills
maybe
but
we
can't
be
sure
of
that
this
is
a
hell
of
a
lot
to
ask
didn't
you
say
to
me
today
you
can't
trust
us
maybe
there's
something
there
that
should
be
addressed
oh
come
on
we
are
clearly
demonstrating
that
we
are
not
together
on
this
buffy
that's
enough
