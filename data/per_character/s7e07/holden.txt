feels
great
strong
like
i'm
connected
to
a
powerful
allconsuming
evil
that's
gonna
suck
the
world
into
a
firey
oblivion
how
'bout
you
no
no
i
mean
with
the
stake
and
the
crossyou
do
this
kind
of
thing
a
lot
so
whatyou
like
fight
vampires
professionally
or
i
heard
a
lot
of
rumors
about
you
back
then
you
were
all
mysterious
well
you
were
never
around
a
lot
of
kids
thought
you
were
dating
some
really
old
guy
or
that
you
were
just
heavy
religious
scott
hope
said
you
were
gay
he
says
that
about
every
girl
he
breaks
up
with
and
then
last
year
big
surprise
he
comes
out
so
all
that
time
you
were
a
slayer
the
like
as
in
the
only
one
oh
so
when
you
said
not
connected
that
was
kind
of
a
telling
statement
wasn't
it
well
i'm
just
saying
hey
it
was
your
phrase
no
no
i
hear
ya
so
you
meet
someone
you
form
a
bond
do
you
mean
in
all
relationships
or
just
yours
you
think
you
do
that
on
purpose
maybe
you're
trying
to
protect
yourself
from
committing
so
it's
them
you're
reaching
out
they're
just
not
coming
through
i
just
think
you're
in
some
pain
herewhich
i
do
kind
of
enjoy
'cause
i'm
evil
nowbut
you
should
just
ease
up
on
yourself
it's
not
exactly
like
you
have
the
patent
on
bad
relationships
and
what
are
yousupposed
to
be
settling
down
already
at
21
you
know
my
girlfriend
at
college
she's
so
sweet
we
have
this
great
thing
but
that
doesn't
mean
i'm
gonna
go
vampify
her
just
so
we
can
be
together
forever
what
cool
oh
i
have
so
much
to
learn
come
on
isn't
this
insane
i
mean
i
was
afraid
to
talk
to
you
in
high
school
and
now
we're
like
mortal
enemies
hey
wouldn't
it
be
cool
if
we
became
nemeses
we're
gonna
have
to
fight
to
the
death
aren't
we
wow
reality
just
shows
up
sometimes
doesn't
it
but
you
know
i've
got
the
bloodlust
pumping
and
i
kinda
get
it
i'm
looking
for
a
fight
and
oh
it's
nothing
personal
and
fun
catching
up
i
haven't
really
kept
in
contact
with
many
of
my
friends
from
high
school
guess
i'll
be
looking
them
up
pretty
soon
hey
i
don't
mean
to
be
count
buttinsky
here
but
you
just
don't
seem
as
thrilled
is
it
because
we're
gonna
fight
hello
two
years
of
tae
kwon
do
and
vampire
strength
i
think
somebody's
counting
their
chickens
do
the
words
superiority
complex
mean
anything
to
you
no
no
i
get
the
battle
against
evil
that's
not
the
issue
just
answer
me
this
whose
fault
was
your
parents
divorce
i'm
just
curious
your
opinion
off
the
top
of
your
head
uhhuh
so
of
all
of
these
relationships
of
yoursthat
you
knew
subconsciously
were
totally
doomedwhose
fault
is
that
i
was
just
wondering
is
it
possible
even
a
little
bit
that
the
reason
you
have
trouble
connecting
to
guys
is
because
you
think
maybe
they're
not
worth
it
maybe
you
think
you're
better
than
them
struck
a
nerve
you
don't
remember
me
at
all
yeah
like
after
30
minutes
of
reminding
and
i
don't
take
it
personally
because
clearly
you
were
in
your
own
little
world
in
high
school
all
chosen
all
destiny
who
could
live
with
that
for
seven
years
and
not
feel
superior
what
buffy
i'm
here
to
kill
you
not
to
judge
you
there's
nothing
wrong
with
you
everyone's
got
issues
what
aw
come
one
i
mean
we
had
a
moment
you
opened
up
it
was
really
sweet
it
make
me
want
to
bite
you
i'm
sorry
if
i
overstepped
my
bounds
i'm
just
new
to
this
mortal
enemy
stuff
pretty
fast
learner
though
right
ok
but
are
you
killing
me
'cause
i'm
evil
or
because
you
opened
up
nothing
i
got
no
worries
i'm
dead
the
biggest
thing
on
my
mind
is
whether
or
not
tricia
waldman
came
to
my
funeral
or
not
do
you
remember
her
ohhbiteable
well
you
know
it'sit's
kind
of
a
guy
thing
we
talk
about
nailing
a
girl
there's
all
this
oh
my
god
oh
well
you
know
not
my
god
because
i
defy
him
and
all
of
his
works
butdoes
he
exist
is
there
word
on
that
by
the
way
oh
i
keep
getting
off
topic
because
my
mind
is
racing
here
all
right
i'll
make
a
deal
with
you
we
fight
to
the
death
great
that
last
fight
was
just
exhilarating
and
i
actually
had
a
move
coming
up
to
block
that
stake
but
you
have
to
answer
one
question
and
if
i'm
right
i
get
to
ask
anythingno
secrets
no
defensiveness
anything
i
want
to
know
your
last
relationshipwas
it
with
a
vampire
didn't
you
tell
me
until
you
can't
win
and
i
thought
i
was
diabolicalor
at
least
i
plan
to
be
you
do
have
a
superiority
complex
and
you've
got
an
inferiority
complex
about
it
kudos
oh
it
makes
every
kind
of
sense
and
it
all
adds
up
to
you
feeling
alone
but
buffy
everybody
feels
alone
everybody
is
until
you
die
speaking
of
you
ready
for
our
little
death
match
oh
you
know
there's
some
things
you
can
only
tell
a
stranger
hold
it
did
you
say
spike
what
do
you
mean
how
he
was
the
guy
that
umoh
what's
the
word
yeah
he
was
the
guy
that
sired
me
