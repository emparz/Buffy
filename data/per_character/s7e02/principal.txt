we'll
sort
of
feel
our
way
around
some
students
will
be
sent
to
you
and
others
i'm
hoping
will
start
to
come
in
on
their
own
you'll
be
surprised
buffy
you're
the
youngest
and
uh
least
stuffy
member
of
this
faculty
i
think
the
students
are
gonna
want
to
come
in
and
talk
to
you
and
when
they
do
don't
evaluate
them
just
listen
they
need
to
feel
like
there's
someone
around
here
who
actually
understands
them
ok
by
me
a
little
authority
can
be
a
wonderful
thing
just
remember
that
while
you
are
here
to
help
you're
not
here
to
be
their
friend
trust
me
you
open
that
door
and
these
students
will
eat
you
alive
hmm
ok
then
and
buffy
relax
there's
only
three
things
these
kids
understand
the
boot
the
bat
and
the
bastinada
it's
the
it's
a
it's
a
bad
joke
it's
the
bastinada
no
one
ever
knows
what
that
thing
is
i
think
you're
gonna
fit
in
just
fine
is
there
something
else
have
this
job
i
know
i'm
a
vegetarian
these
students
need
someone
around
here
who
understands
them
and
i
need
someone
who
understands
these
students
why
is
there
something
about
you
that
i
don't
know
that
maybe
i
should
oh
if
you'll
excuse
me
first
catch
of
the
day
i'll
be
in
my
office
if
you
need
me
