is
a
large
simple
gothic

at

chapel
that
can
be

looks
around

three
stained

arched
windows
on

sidewall
of
the
chapel
she
walks
forward
and
jumps
when

speaks
to

from
the
shadows

barechested
holding
his
shirt

to
her

looking
down
at
the
ground
even
though
he
is
standing
right
in
front
of
her
buffy
reaches
for
his
chest
where
the
scars
seen
in
episode

lessons
are
healing
spike
flinches
recoils
violently
and
looks
her
into
her
eyes
spike
nods
spike
starts
unzipping
his
pants
buffy
is
disgusted
and
smacks
his
hands
away
from
his
pants
spike
reflexively
reaches
up
and
grabs
her
by
the
throat
buffy
grabs
his
shoulder
and
throws
him
across
the
room
spike
lands
on
top
of
some
pews
breaking
them
into
pieces
he
sits
up
a
little
propped
on
his
elbows
behind
him
spike's
looking
around
the
room
buffy
walks
over
to
him
spike
lucidly
spike
starts
to
cry
spike
stands
and
walks
away
to
a
nearby
window
he
stands
there
mostly
in
shadow
his
body
directed
away
from
her
he
looks
back
over
his
shoulder
at
her
keeping
an
eye
on
him
buffy
bends
down
to
pick
up
a
large
splinter
from
the
broken
pews
at
her
feet
to
use
as
a
stake
if
necessary

starts
pacing

walks
around

disbelief
and
finally
comprehension

laughs
buffy
turns
to
face
him

looking
at
the

down
and

toward

looks
back
over

to

looks
away
spike
walks
toward
the
6foottall
crucifix
altarpiece
at
the
front
of
the
chapel
sounds
like
he's
quoting
something
spike's
standing
only
a
foot
away
from
the
crucifix
staring
at
it
spike
sighs
spike
embraces
the
crucifix
resting
one
arm
over
each
side
of
the
cross
bar
and
resting
his
head
in
the
corner
of
the
vertex
his
body
is
sizzling
and
smoke
is
rising
from
where
it
touches
the
cross
a
closeup
of
buffy's
face
shows
that
she
is
crying
now
from
where
she
stands
spike's
exhausted
body
hanging
limply
on
the
cross
resembles
jesus
except
the
view
is
of
spike's
back
