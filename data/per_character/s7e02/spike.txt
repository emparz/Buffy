totally
different
matter
no
manners

the
problem
proper
breeding
lack
of
etiquette

of
it

of
it

you
need
is
help
fortunately
you've
got
me
buffy
i
have
easy
if
you
think
i
like
putting
myself
here
surrounded
by
people
who
don't
particularly
like
me
you'd
be
wrong
i'll
be
quick
we
need
to
talk
want
to
do
that
here
or
privately
i
did
before
i
start
and
for
the
record
the
last
you
saw
me
i
was
a
mess—out
of
my
head
admitted
last
week
living
in
the
school
basement
well
you
saw
me
now
in
fairness
to
buffy—
i
didn't
come
here
to
atone
i'm
here
to
help
you
i
was
hoping
you'd
tell
me
you're
the
slayer
connected
to
the
visions
long
line
of
worthies
right
i'm
just
a
guy
with
his
ear
to
the
ground
and
even
i
can
feel
it
something's
coming
i
don't
know
what
exactly
but
something's
brewing
and
it's
so
big
ugly
and
damned
it
makes
you
and
me
look
like
little
bitty
puzzle
pieces
i
mean
if
i'm
wrong
say
so
lovely
no
hard
feelings
i'll
go
out
that
door
and
you
can
lock
it
behind
me
with
any
spell
you
like
so
am
i
wrong
you're
gonna
need
some
help
i
didn't
i'm
just
a
guy
who
can
lend
a
hand
if
you'll
let
me
ball's
in
your
court
slayer
rightyo
then
yeah
what's
your
point
niblet
you're
awfully
quiet
fine
with
me
i
was
more
halfexpecting
to
get
an
earful
anyway
and
when
exactly
did
your
sister
get
unbelievably
scary
what
i
told
you
once
straight
up
i'm
here
to
help
and
that's
all
think
this
here
is
our
spot
i
don't
fancy
sticking
my
head
in
there
when
you
saw
me
those
ghostly
types
in
the
school
basement
got
in
my
head
made
me
flatout
bugshaggin'
crazy
and
i'm
not
exactly
braggin'
about
it
but
they
were
stronger
than
i
was
made
me
see
things
do
things
and
how
come
you
never
told
anyone
that
you
saw
me
sorry
to
disappoint
hold
the
torch
would
you
it's
not
look
i
can't
blame
you
for
being
all
skittish
neither
do
i
i
can't
say
sorry
can't
use
forgive
me
all
i
can
say
is
buffy
i've
changed
well
that's
something
you're
right
there
is
but
we're
not
best
friends
anymore
so
too
bad
for
me
i'm
not
sharing
we've
been
through
things
the
end
of
the
world
and
back
i
can
be
useful
'cause
honestly
i've
got
nothing
better
to
do
make
use
of
me
if
you
want
nd
there's
nothing
here
just
a
bit
of
slime
mounds
of
displaced
dirt
and
such
whatever
our
beastie

gone

through
get

hard
service
the

serviced
because
there's
no
spark
ain't
we
in
a
soddin'
engine
well
yes
where've
you
been
all
night
first
time
for
everything
i
tried
to
find
it
of
course
the
spark
the
missing
the
piece
that
fit
that
would
make
me
fit
because
you
didn't
want
god
i
can't
not
with
you
looking
i
dreamed
of
killing
you
i
think
they
were
dreams
so
weak
did
you
make
me
weak
thinking
of
you
holding
myself
and
spilling
useless
buckets
of
salt
over
your
ending
angel—he
should've
warned
me
he
makes
a
good
show
of
forgetting
but
it's
here
in
me
all
the
time
the
spark
i
wanted
to
give
you
what
you
deserve
and
i
got
it
they
put
the
spark
in
me
and
now
all
it
does
is
burn
bit
worse
for
lack
of
use
it's
what
you
wanted
right
it's
what
you
wanted
right

and—and
now
everybody's
in
here
talking
everything
i
dideveryone
i—
and
him
and
it
the
other
the
thing
beneath—beneath
you
it's
here
too
everybody
they
all
just
tell
me
go
go
to
hell
buffy
shame
on
you
why
does
a
man
do
what
he
mustn't
for
her
to
be
hers
to
be
the
kind
of
man
who
would
nev—
to
be
a
kind
of
man
she
shall
look
on
him
with
forgiveness
and
everybody
will
forgive
and
love
he
will
be
loved
so
everything's
ok
right
can—can
we
rest
now
