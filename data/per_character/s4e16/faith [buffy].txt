choose
to
pout
and
whine
and
feel
the
burden
of
slayerness
i

i
could
be
rich
i
could
be
famous
i

your
eyes
rolled
up
i've
got
muscles
you've
never
even
dreamed
of
i
could
squeeze
you
until
you
popped
like
warm
champagne
and
you'd
beg
me
to
hurt
you
just
a
little
bit
more
and
you

humh
humh

this
is
tara
so
we've
never
met
cool
just
have
a
thing
with
names
unhhuh
got
tired
you
know
the
whole
faith
thing
i
let
off
some
steam
that's
my
philosophy
so
you
guys
been
hanging
out
a
lot
lately
huh
so
willow's
not
driving
stick
anymore
who
would
have
thought
i
guess
you
never
really
know
someone
until
you've
been
inside
their
skin
and
oz
is
out
of
the
picture
oh
never
seen
two
people
so
much
in
love
she
just
couldn't
get
enough
of
old
oz
yeah
good
call
wicked
obvious
so
i
should
slay
him
hey
you'll
live
yeah
well
he's
gone
now
yeah
it's
cool
all's
well
in
the
world
yeah
you
give
her
whatever
she
needs
hi
baby
you
miss
me
everything's
great
faith
has
a
won
a
fabulous
trip
to
england
and
i
got
the
consolation
prize
which
is
you
oh
you
wouldn't
have
liked
faith
she's
not
proper
and
joyless
like
a
girl
should
be
she
has
a
tendency
to
give
in
to
her
animal
instincts
so
oh
maybe
they
could
learn
something
you're
hurt
maybe
we
should
take
you
for
a
test
drive
sohow

you
want
me
