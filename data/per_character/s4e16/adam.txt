i've
been
thinking
about
vampires
you're
place
yes
the
sewers
you
hide
from
them
crawl
about
in
their
filth
scavenging
like
rats
what
do
you
fear
you
fear
the
cross
the
sun
fire
and
oh
yes
i
believe
decapitation
is
a
problem
as
well
you
fear
death
being
immortal
you
fear
it
more
than
those
to
whom
it
comes
naturally
vampires
are
a
paradox
demon
in
a
human
body
you
walk
in
both
worlds
and
belong
to
neither
i
can
relate
come
we
have
a
lot
to
talk
about
i
have
a
gift
no
man
has
no
demon
has
ever
had
i
know
why
i'm
here
i
was
created
to
kill
to
extinguish
life
wherever
i
find
it
and
i
have
accepted
that
responsibility
you
have
lived
in
fear
and
desperation
because
you
didn't
have
that
gift
but
it's
time
to
face
your
fear
you
are
here
to
be
my
first
to
let
them
know
that
i
am
coming
then
ask
yourself
what
is
it
more
than
man
more
than
anything
else
what
is
the
thing
you
fear
