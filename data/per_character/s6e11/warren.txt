okay
that's
it
it's
finally
done
i
mean
it
still
needs
a
trial
run
but
it's
jonathan
kind
of
clunkylooking
what
you
wanna
see
cool
i'll
show
you
cool
well
that's
just
half
the
test
oh
cheer
up
frodo
because
thanks
to
my
brains
and
our
mystical
gem
we
got
ourselves
an
invisibility
ray
and
i'd
say
that
makes
us
pretty
much
unstoppable
you
should
know
you've
cased
this
joint
enough
okay
this
is
it
remember
we're
professionals
what
whwhere
hey
watch
it
don't
you
warren
runs
over
and
tries
to
get
the
ray
away
from
them
the
bit
on
top
is
spinning
and
the
whirring
noise
intensifies
couple
of
circuits
are
burned
out
and
the
wiring's
all
fried
i
wouldn't
sweat
the
slayer
too
much
the
slayer
got
slammed
with
a
bigass
dose
of
radiation
when
the
gun
overloaded
her
cells
are
mutating
at
an
accelerated
rate
eventually
her
molecular
makeup
will
start
losing
its
integrity
and
then

pfft
well
lemme
think
yeah
you
guys
are
so
immature
we're
villains
when
are
you
gonna
get
that
through
your
thick
skulls
because
it's
superman's
book
you
moron
fine
whatever
you
guys
say
now
it's
tucker's
brother
we're
your
archnemesises

ses
you
may
have
beaten
us
this
time
slayer
but
next
time

um

uh
next
time
what
do
you
mean
it's
locked
you
were
supposed
to
check
it
