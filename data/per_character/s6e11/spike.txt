neck
of
the
woods

yourself

call
you

pet
sweetheart

uh

little
goldilocks
you

i
love
this
hair
the
way
it
bounces
around
when
you
buffy
suddenly
lifts
her
hand
out
of
the
sink
holding
a
spatula
on
trajectory
toward
spike's
face
but
he
grabs
her
wrist
and
stops
it

flapjack's
not
ready
to
be
flipped
