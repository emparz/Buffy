that
peacock
on
the
table
it
has
two
crystals
in
it
tara
she
she
left
them
i'm
okay
not
'ready
to
head
back
to
classes
face
the
world'
okay
but

the
shakiness
is
only
semi
now
i
thought
i'd
spend
the
day
fishing
the
net
for
more
poop
on
the
uh
stolen
diamond
hey
dawnie
uh
i'm
making
you
a
nice
omelet
okay
i
deserve
the
wrath
of
dawn
but

why
is
she
taking
it
out
on
you
buffy
i
was
the
one
who
buffy
who
was
drowning
my
best
friend
and
i
was
too
wrapped
up
in
my
own
dumb
life
to
even
notice
i'm
uh
gonna
head
back
to
my
room
get
dressed
buffy
i'm
not
feeling
hot
so
uh
i'm
gonna
take
a
quick
nap
okay
xander
um

good
i
i
uh
found

out
some
stuff
about
the
diamond
stolen
from
the
museum
it's
called
the
illuminata
and
there's
rumors
of
it
having
quasimystical
quantum
properties
we

are
talking
well
i'm
talking
and
you're
looking
at
me
funny
it
was
nothing
i

ii
didn't
slip
fix
what
buffy's
broken
what
oh
i
see
so
now
when
anything
nasty
happens
i
get
conveniently
blamed
for
it
so

i
guess
it
wouldn't
matter
if
i
just
jump
off
the
wagon
completely

since
you
already
think
i'm
making
pit
stops
for
a
walk
look
xander
i

i
figured
out
this
was
where
buffy
disappeared
from
what
you
told
me
so
don't
start
jumping
to
any
conclusions
i'm
not
feeling
like
myself
right
now
sorry
well
take
a
look
at
that
something
sped
outta
here
pretty
dann
quick
to
to
make
that
kind
of
tread
mark
yeah
but
this

wasn't
paint
that
i
scraped
off
the
fire
hydrant
that
one
whatever
hit
this
fire
hydrant
hit
it
after
it
was
made
invisible
and
betcha
by
golly
wow
that
something
was
the
same
something
that
shot
out
of
that
alley
iit's
a
pylon
one
of
those
orange
traffic
cones
you
should
take
it
to
the
magic
box
it
might
help
you
and
anya
figure
out
what
kind
of
spell
was
used
well
i
got
paint
scrapings
and
a
tire
mark
i'm
gonna
find
this
van
that's
been
stalking
buffy
by
the
way
where
is
buffy
hey
let
go
of
me
buffy
he's
bluffing
buffy
there
there's
just
three
of
them
i
think
ow
they're
the
ones
from
your
mystery
van
they
told
me
everything
buffy
something's
happening
to
you
that
you're
invisible
buffy
fading
away
i
know
you're
on
the
wrong
setting
the
gun
it's
not
set
for
reversing
the
particle
ionization
it'll
accelerate
her
molecular
dissolution
i
saw
the
plans
buffy
he's
trying
to
kill
you
oh
my
god
buffy
no
your
hair
it
is
adorable
the
hard
way
the
spellfree
way
the
ohmygodmyhead'sgonnafalloff
myfeetarekillingme
way
i
don't
know
how
i
got
through
this
day
how
are
you
doing
postinvisibleness

me
about
it
