of
educators
tell
students
'think
of
your
principal
as
your
pal'
cut
to
snyder's
office
he's
lecturing
buffy
and
sheila
i
say
'think
of
me
as
your
judge
jury
and
executioner'
tell
me
who
do
you
think
is
the
most
troublesome
student
in
this
school
well
it
is
quite
a
match
between
you
two
on
the
one
hand
buffy
hasn't
stabbed
a
horticulture
teacher
with
a
trowel
on
the
other
hand
sheila
has
never
burned
down
a
school
building
mice
the
two
of
you
seem
to
be
tied
in
the
classcutting
and
fight
starting
events
you
really
are
neck
and
neck
here
it's
quite
exciting

is
parent
teacher
night
your
parents
assuming
you
have
any
will
meet
your
teachers
assuming
you
have
any
left
i've
decided
to
put
the
two
of
you
in
charge
of
this
event
you
have
three
days
to
prepare
the
refreshments
make
the
banners
and
transform
the
school
lounge
into
a
habitable
place
for
adults
this
will
incur
my
good
will
and
may
affect
what
i
tell
your
parents
when
i
meet
them
are
we
clear
good
because
you
mess
up
this
time
and
your
parents
will
be
coming
to
clean
out
your
lockers
you
wouldn't
be
helping
buffy
in
sheila's
place

you
she
ditched

feel
an
expulsion
