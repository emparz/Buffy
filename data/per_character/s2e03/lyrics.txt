a
drink
you
can't
resist

and
in
your
head
a
voice
you'll
always
miss
i
did
a
stupid
thing
last
night

i
called
you

a
moment
of
weakness

no
not
a
moment

more
like
three
months
of
weakness
i'm
one
step
away
from
crashing
to
my
knees

one
step
away
from
spilling
my
guts
to
you
i'm
doing
all
right

no
don't
feel
sorry
for
me

really
i'm
all
right

i'm
one
step
away
from
crashing
to
my
knees
