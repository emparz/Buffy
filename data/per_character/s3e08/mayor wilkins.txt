oh
look
at
that
every
time
cuts
to
the
left
see
and
it's
not
the
carpet
it's
me
i
swear
i
would
sell
my
soul
for
a
decent
short
game
of
course
it's
a
little
late
for
that
i
don't
suppose
i
could
offer
your
soul
huh
really
help
me
on
the
green
i'm
just
funning
so
we
have
a
spike
problem
do
we
well
yes
y'know
he
was
up
to
all
sorts
of
shenanigans
last
year
we
had
a
world
of
fun
trying
to
guess
what
he'd
do
next
but
i
guess
we're
past
that
now
this
year
is
too
important
to
let
a
loose
cannon
rock
the
boat
loose
cannon
rock
the
boat
is
that
a
mixed
metaphor
boats
did
have
cannons
and
a
loose
one
would
cause
it
to
rock
oh
honestly
i
don't
know
where
my
mind
goes
these
days
why
don't
you
take
care
of
that
spike
problem
a
committee
like
you
said
that's
swell
fore
hey
