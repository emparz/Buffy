you
can't
trust
him
invite
me
in
you
touch
her
and
i'll
cut
your
head
off
where
are
they
buffy
we
still
need
him
to
find
the
others
now
what
right
lot
of
trouble
for
somebody
who
doesn't
even
care
about
you
she
really
is
just
kind
of
fickle
that's
right

i
don't
think
we
have
a
choice
can
we
get
to
the
roof
i'm
alright
that
window's
about
to
go
buffy

i
was
wondering
when

some
way

still
see
each
other
