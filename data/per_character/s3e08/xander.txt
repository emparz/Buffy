it's
not
that
bad
willow
really
that's
right
and
the
fact
that
your
740
verbal
closely
resembles
my
combined
scores
in
no
way
compromises
your
position
as
the
village
idiot
you
did
amazing
willow
as
usual
cordelia
willow
was
very
sad
by
her
academic
failure
how
did
you
do
this
is
not
good
well
i'm
just
worried
it
may
hurt
my
standing
as
campus
stud
when
people
find
out
i'm
dating
a
brain
you
know
it
sounds
a
lot
like
your
regular
voice
a
double
date
it
could
have
potential
by
the
look
on
your
face
i'm
guessing
you
and
i
are
gonna
be
manning
the
drivethrough
window
side
by
side
buff
that's
amazing
then
why
the
sour
puss
c'mon
it'll
be
fun
what's
classier
than
bowling
oz
and
willow
are
down
you're
the
swing
vote
i
guarantee
fun
hey
those
are
from
the
pier
there's
pictures
of
me
in
your
locker
i
never
knew
i
was
locker
door
material
yeah
well
prepare
to
be
crushed
maybe
we
should
practice
like
what
it's
just
bowling
how
are
they
gonna
know
you're
turned
on
by
rented
shoes
okay
well
let
me
ask
you
this
what
are
they
gonna
know
that
we're
friends
old
old
friends
and
maybe
we've
had
one
or
two
indiscretions
but
that's
all
past
look
we're
just
very
good
friends
who
like
to
hang
out
and
can
i
kiss
your
earlobe
maybe
bowling
might
be
too
much
to
handle
man
i
wish
i
wasn't
so
attracted
to
you
i
wish
we
could
make
it
all
stop
whoa
it
smells
like
church
in
here
no
wait
evil
church
so
you
said
when
you
called
why
do
i
have
to
be
here
but
that's
why
you
love
me
right
academically
dangerous
a
feather
and
who
will
i
be
tickling
i
assume
this
isn't
going
to
make
us
late
for
our
evening
of
bowling
magic
can
we
turn
these
lights
on
is
that
a
spell
book
wait
a
minute
this
is
love
spell
stuff
you're
doing
a
love
spell
are
you
nuts
or
have
you
forgotten
that
i
tend
to
have
bad
luck
with
these
sorts
of
spells
yeah
i
wish
for
a
lot
of
things
i
told
you
i
wished
i
was
a
fireman
when
we
were
in
sixth
grade
but
you
didn't
follow
through
on
that
so
do
you
really
need
to
resort
to
the
black
arts
to
keep
our
hormones
in
check
i'm
gonna
get
the
lights
clean
this
place
up
before
they
get
here
and
start
asking
questions
dizzy
kind
of
nauseous
too
do
i
remember
having
a
fight
with
spike
i
won
right
kicked
his
ass
no
i'll
be
okay
where
are
we
that
burntout
place
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
so
we're
pretty
much
in
a
'scream
all
you
want'
scenario
why
didn't
he
just
kill
us
what
gee
and
we
had
all
hoped
those
crazy
kids
would
make
it
work
so
what
are
our
options
give
me
a
third
option
will
we're
not
gonna
die
if
he's
so
drunk
he'll
get
sloppy
and
then
i'll
make
my
move
as
long
as
my
move
doesn't
involve
standing
up
or
using
my
limbs
we'll
be
okay
exemption
for
impending
death
situation
oh
god
cordy
i
cordelia
cordelia
yeah
cordy
please
hold
on
cordy
can
i
come
in
they
wouldn't
let
me
see
you
until
now
those
are
flowers

cordy
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
yeah
