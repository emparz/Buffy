oh
god
buffy
you're
alive
you're
here
and
you're
still

remarkably
strong
willow
told
me
but
i
didn't
really
let
myself
believe

it's
uh

you're

yes
but
then
i
always
thought
so
so

uh
i'm
not
really
sure
how
to
answer
that
um
well
i
arrived
home
i
uh
met
with
the
council
yes
otherwise
there's
uh
nothing
really
to
report
i
um
i
keep
a
flat
in
bath
i
i
uh
met
with
a
few
old
friends
almost
made
a
new
one
which
i
think
is

statistically
impossible
for
a
man
of
my
age
yes
i
can't
lie
to
you
buffy
um

leaving
sunnydale
was
uh
was
difficult
and
uh
coming
back
was
no
bewildering
and
how
are
you
really
you
look
tired
you
seem
to
be
doing
remarkably
well
under
extreme
circumstances
i'm
proud
of
you
youyou
know

i
meant

buffy
i
know
what
you
meant
it
was
just
a
little
postpostmortem
comedy
yes
there
is
always
that
isn't
there
i
know
i
did
and
do
we
have
information
on
this
new
demon
that
i
suddenly
find
so
desperately
interesting
oh
m'fashnik
oh
uh
no
quite
different
actually
by
reputation
yes
they
they
come
from
a
long
line
of
mercenary
demons
that
perform
acts
of
slaughter
and
mayhem
for
the
highest
bidder
yes
but
uh
the
question
now
becomes
what's
out
there
powerful
enough
to
control
one
of
these
things
think
nothing
of
it
it's
it's
uh
whimsical
what
how
bad
is
it
sound
policy
at
least
for
tonight
buffy
perhaps
you're
putting
too
much
pressure
on
yourself
i
mean
to
return
from
some

unknown
level
of
hell

it's
only
natural
that
coming
back

will
be
a
process
well
that
can
take
time
too
well
if
it's
any
consolation
life
can
be

pretty
overwhelming
even
for
people
who
haven't
been

where
you
have
look
tomorrow
morning
you
and
i
will
sit
down
together
and
we'll
go
through
everything
every
bill
one
by
one
we'll
work
it
out
together
well
i'm
glad
you
are
too
yes
now
that
she's
back
mmm
tell
me
about
this
spell
you
performed
you're
a
very
stupid
girl
do
you
have
any
idea
what
you've
done
the
forces
you've
harnessed
the
lines
you've
crossed
oh
don't
worry
you've

made
a
very
deep
impression
of
everyone
here

you
were
the
one
i
trusted
most
to
respect
the
forces
of
nature
think
what
you've
done
to
buffy
at
incredible
risk
of
killing
us
all
unleashing
hell
on
earth
i
mean
shall
i
go
on
oh
there
are
others
in
this
world
who
can
do
what
you
did
you
just
don't
want
to
meet
them
you
were
lucky
if
i
had
been
i'd
have
bloody
well
stopped
you
the
magicks
you
channeled
are
more
ferocious
and
primal
than
anything
you
can
hope
to
understand
and
you
are
lucky
to
be
alive
you
rank
arrogant
amateur
we
still
don't
know
where
she
was

or
what
happened
to
her
and
i'm
far
from
convinced
she's
come
out
of
all
this
undamaged
dawn
couldn't
sleep
evidently
not
does
it
work
i'm
an
ideal
control
group
i
find
as
you
get
older
that
you
lose
patience
with
throwing
up
is
that
locked
well
i
know
i'm
back
in
america
now
i've
been
knocked
unconscious
thank
you
buffy
yes
you
can
your
mother
dealt
with
this
sort
of
thing
all
the
time
she
took

one
crisis
at
a
time

without
the
aid
of
any
superpowers

and
got
through
it
all
so
can
you
i'm
positive
i
very
much
doubt
it
poorlyventilated

what
have
you
been
reading
buffy
what
is
it
is
he
in
trouble
yes
of
course
you'll
leave
for
la
tomorrow
i
see
well
we
should
get
all
these

bills
and
things
out
of
the
way
before
buffy
i
gotta
go
now
