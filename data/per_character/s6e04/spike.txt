you
hear
all
that
noise
you
know
watcherboy
doesn't
mean
anything
by
it
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
you
around
that
bend
luv
and
that
makes
'em
worry
even
more
you
want
me
to
take
them
out
give
me
a
hell
of
a
headache
but
i
could
probably
thin
the
herd
a
little
knew
i
could
get
a
grin
'cause
that's
when
you're
alone
i
reckon
i'm
not
one
for
crowds
myself
these
days
that
works
out
nicely
then
whoa
did
you
know
this
place
was
flooded
