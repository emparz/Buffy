an
idea
i
can
give
the
excess
out
to
the
townspeople
exchanging
them
not
for
goods
or
services
but
for
goodwill
and
the
sense
of
accomplishment
that
stems
from
selflessly
giving
of
yourself
to
others

better
spot
for
vengeance
than
a
brothel
well
of
course
what
else
is

is
there
to
be
interested
in
the
worker

overthrow

lead
the
proletariat
to
a
victorious
communist
revolution
resulting
in
socioeconomic
paradise
on

with
wronged
women
who
need
my
help
i'm
talking
about

what
i

slaughtered
people
weeks
ago
thank
you

here
in
time
she's
coming
to
try
i
have
a
job
to
do
and
so
does
buffy
xander
you've
always
seen
what
you
wanted
to
but
you
knew
sooner
or
later
it
would
come
to
this
get
out
of
her
way
xander
this
is
getting
to
be
a
pattern
with
you
buffy
are
there
any
friends
of
your
left
you
haven't
tried
to
kill
c'mon
buffy
don't
you
have
a
clever
retort
for
me
you're
apologizing
to
me
what
fight
are
you
watching
or
is
this
like
one
of
your
little
popculture
references
i
don't
get
'cause
i'm
a
vengeance—
honey
honey
honey
was
that
weird
that
thing
earlier
with
the
singing
and
the
coconuts
are
you
still
hungry
because
i'd
be—
mr
xander
harris
that's
what
he
is
to
the
world
outside

that's
the
name
he
carries
with
pride
i'm
just
lately
anya

not
very
much
to
the
world
i
know

all
these
years
with
nothing
to
show
i've
boned
a
troll
i've
wreaked
some
wrath

but
on
the
whole
i've
had
no
path
i
like
to
bowl
i'm
good
with
math

but
who
am
i
now
i
reply
that

i'm
the
missus
i
will
be
his
missus

mrs
anya
christina
emanuella
jenkins
harris
what's
the
point
of
loving
i
mean
except
for
the
sweaty
part
what's
the
point
of
losing
your
heart

maybe
if
you're
lucky

being
a
pair
makes
you
twice
as
tall
maybe
you're
not
losing
at
all
no
need
to
cover
up
my
heart
so
maybe
love
is
pretty
smart

and
so
am
i

i
found
my
guy

and
i'll
be
missus
i
will
be
his
missus

mrs
anya
lameassmadeupmaidenname
harris

we'll
never
part
not
if
we
can

and
if
we
start

then
here's
my
plan

i'll
show
him
what
bliss
is

welcome
him
with
kisses

'cause
this
is
a
missus
who
misses
her
man

he's
my
xander

and
he's
awfully
swell

it
makes
financial
sense
as
well

although
he
can
be—i'll
never
tell—

just
stand
aside

here
comes
the
bride
i'll
be
missus

i
will
be
his
missus

i
will
be—
forgotten
how
much
swords
through
the
chest
hurt
aaahh
you
know
better
than
that
buffy
it
takes
a
lot
more
to
kill
a
vengeance
demon
stop
trying
to
save
me
xander
i
wanna
take
it
back
i
wanna
take
it
back
i
wanna
undo
what
i
did
do
it
stay
out
of
this
xander
xander
you
can't
help
me
i'm
not
even
sure
there's
a
me
to
help
i
understand
the
price
do
it
this
is
my
wish
undo
what
i
did
hallie
why
but
she
was
yours
you
should've
killed
me
xander
please
just
go
away
yes
i
should
my
whole
life
i've
just
clung
to
whatever
came
along
thanks
for
everything
xander—
what
if
i'm
really
nobody
i'm
a
dope
that's
a
start
