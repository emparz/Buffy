not
since
that
night
with
the
gnarl
demon
and
that
wasn't
exactly
the
kind
of
how
have
you
been
kind
of
talk
more
of
the
pierce
its
eye
with
something
sharp
kind
of
talking
i'm
thinking
i
should
call
her
hopes
oh
no
no
no
no
no
there
are
no
hopes
anya
and
i
are
done
i
love
being
single
i'm
a
strong
successful
male
who
is
giddy
at
the
thought
of
all
the
women
i
will
no
doubt
be
dating
in
the
near
future
i
just
worry
about
her
that's
all
yeah
she
seems
so
sad
oh
that
no
no
i
don't
worry
about
that
she
was
hurt
and
she
just
turned
back
to
what
she
knew
when
i—
you
know
but
that's
not
her
anymore
well
she
turned
that
worm
guy
back
before
any
real
damage
happened
right
it'll
just
take
some
time
i
really
think
she's
coming
around
are
you
kidding
we're
doing
vent
work
at
the
site
anything's
better
than
breathing
freon
for
eight
hours
so
did
she
say
what
this
thing
is
ah
yes
there
is
little
that
can
distract
the
willow
when
she's
on
the
hunt
for
the
mighty
syllabi
how
big
did
she
say
this
thing
was
or
a
copycat
spider
demon
so
what's
this
black
stuff
aw
it's
sticky
this
isn't
springy
highflying
fun
is
that
it
maybe
we
can
somehow
lure
it
buffy
where'd
it
go
i
think
we
need
more
swords
i
say
we
go
home
pick
up
more
swords
and
some
sort
of
spidery
demon
protection
amulet
we
come
back
and—
or—
when
were
you
planning
on
telling
us
great
thank
you
willow
it's
anya
how
could
you
let
us—
how
could
you
not
have
told
us
how
could
you
not
have
told
me
that
doesn't
mean
you
have
to
kill
her
there
are
other
options
when
just
now
took
you
all
of
ten
seconds
to
decide
to
kill
one
of
your
best
friends
but
we
can
change
what
she
did
fix
it
these
are
mystical
deaths
right
there
has
to
be
something
hard
for
me
to
hear
buffy
you
wanna
kill
anya
then
don't
this
isn't
new
ground
for
us
when
our
friends
go
all
crazy
and
start
killing
people
we
help
them
i'm
sorry
but
it's
true
because
you
don't
care
about
her
the
same
way
i
do
buffy
i
still
love
her
and
you're
the
slayer
i
see
now
how
it's
all
very
simple
no
of
course
not
you
know
if
there's
a
massmurdering
demon
that
you're
oh
say
boning
then
it's
all
gray
area
he
had
no
choice
you
have
no
idea
what
she's
going
through
no
of
course
not
you
think
we
haven't
seen
all
this
before
the
part
where
you
just
cut
us
all
out
just
step
away
from
everything
human
and
act
like
you're
the
law
if
you
knew
what
i
felt—
this
is
different—
there
has
to
be
another
way
i
thought
i
might
find
you
here
have
you
forced
yourself
to
look
at
the
bodies
yet
i
want
to
help
you
i'm
sorry
i'm
sorry
for
everything
i
did
to
you
everything
i
put
you
through
you
don't
understand
this
isn't
an
intervention
buffy's
coming
to
kill
you
did
everybody
have
their
crazy
flakes
today
you
guys
are
friends
how
could
you
talk
like
this
buffy
get
out
of
here
no
i
just
want
happy
ending
what
i'm
awake
i'm
ok
what
no
it's
fine
anya
stay
away
from
willow
her
name
is
anya
wait
ok
all
right
that
seems
smart
he
just
said
you
have
to
die
perhaps
there's
some
sort
of
alternate
price
no
anya
wait
whatever's
between
us—it
doesn't
matter
you
shouldn't
be
alone
in
this
well
speaking
as
a
clingee—
i
kinda
didn't
mind
don't
be
a
dope
sometimes
