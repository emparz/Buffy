impressive
what
is
that
a
woodlow
transmogriphic
spell
thornton's
hope
but
how
did
you
get
the
troll
element
eelsbane
brilliant
what'd
he
do
is
there
any
other
kind
i'm
sorry
how
rude
of
me
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
my
name
is
d'hoffryn
are
you
hmm
i'm
afraid
you
don't
see
your
true
self
you
are
anyanka
i'm
a
patron
of
a
family
of
sorts
we're
vengeance
demons
i'm
sure
you've
heard
of
us
oh
well
that's
quite—
i
get
the
sense
that
your
talents
are
not
fully
appreciated
here
anyanka
we'd
like
you
to
join
us
perhaps
but
anyanka
is
who
you
are
what
you
do
best
help
wronged
women
punish
evil
men
but
only
to
those
who
deserve
it
that's
where
i
was
going
with
that
yeah
behold
d'hoffryn
lord
of
arashmahar
he
that
turns
the
air
to
blood
and
rains—
miss
rosenberg
how
lovely
to
see
you
again
have
you
done
something
with
your
hair
i
figured
i'd
be
hearing
from
you
soon
the
flaying
of
warren
meers
oh
truly
inspired
that
was
water
cooler
vengeance
lloyd
has
a
sketch
of
it
on
his
wall
is
that
right
so
i
didn't
feel
your
presence
earlier
today
i
didn't
feel
a
bit
of
the
old
you
very
well
let's
talk
about
anyanka
oh
please
don't
mind
me
continue
with
whatever
it
was
you
were
doing
oh
breathtaking
it's
like
somebody
slaughtered
an
abercrombie
and
fitch
catalog
easy
now
i'd
be
gone
before
you
could
swing
isn't
that
just
like
a
slayer
solving
all
her
problems
by
sticking
things
with
sharp
objects
i
talked
to
your
friend
miss
rosenberg
she's
a
firebrand
i
have
high
hopes
for
her
oh
he's
gallant
isn't
he
i
understand
what
you
saw
in
him
look
miss
rosenberg
seems
to
think
anyanka
would
be
better
suited
outside
the
vengeance
fold
i
think
we
already
know
what
lady
hacksaway
wants
and
the
young
man
he
sees
with
the
eyeballs
of
love
but
i'm
not
sure
if
anyone's
bothered
to
find
out
what
anyanka
herself
really
wants
actually
funny
historical
sidebar
her
original
name
was—
i'm
sorry
what
was
that
hmm
you
want
to
take
it
back
must
be
twelve
bodies
in
there
such
a
thing—not
easily
done
but
not
impossible
you're
a
big
girl
anyanka
you
understand
how
this
works
the
proverbial
scales
must
balance
in
order
to
restore
the
lives
of
the
victims
the
fates
require
a
sacrifice
the
life
and
soul
of
a
vengeance
demon
you're
sure
this
is
your
wish
very
well
who
did
you
think
you
were
dealing
with
did
you
think
it
would
be
that
easy
to
get
away
why
because
you
wished
it
like
you
were
mine
haven't
i
taught
you
anything
anya
never
go
for
the
kill
when
you
can
go
for
the
pain
hold
him
back
slayer
wouldn't
want
anyone
to
get
hurt
i've
got
plenty
of
girls
there
will
always
be
vengeance
demons
but
now
you
anya
you're
out
congratulations
you're
wish
is
granted
oh
i
wouldn't
worry
about
that
from
beneath
you

patient
all
good
things
in
time
