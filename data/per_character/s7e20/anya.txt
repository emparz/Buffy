no
let
the
girl
speak
the
truth
we're
all
on
death's
door
repeatedly
ringing
the
doorbell
like
maniacal
girl
scouts
trying
to
make
quota
don't
worry
it's
far
more
likely
you'll
live
long
enough
to
watch
most
of
your
friends
die
first
and
then
you'll
die
who's
basically
untouchable
you
were
expecting
what
a
rhodes
scholar
they
could
show
a
little
respect
you
know
i
mean
they
should
at
least
acknowledge
the
fact
that
some
people
might
not
want
to
listen
to
an
a
capella
concert
of
people
you
know
moaning
and
groaning
disgusting
is
what
it
is
of
course
i
am
i'm
a
lot
jealous
i
mean
if
we're
done
having
sex
then
i
think
other
people
should
just
knock
it
off
