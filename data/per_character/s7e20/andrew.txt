i
spy
with
my
little
eye
something
that
begins
with
a
t
hey
good
one
how
did
you—
ahso
say
you
but
i
say
look
deeper
don't
spazz
out
rock
paper
scissors
uhyeah
we're
waiting
here
till
it's
night
again
so
you
can
ride
on
your
motorcycle
without
exploding
come
on
what's
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
to
her
hi
everybody
i
missed
you
guys
a
lot
sorry
it
took
so
long
to
get
back
from
our
missionmission
but
we
had
to
wait
out
the
sun
well
i
think
our
mission
went
very
well
we
uh
we
rode
on
spike's
hog
which
was
very
cool
and
uh
uh
played
some
amusing
games
and—oh
we
got
some
new
information
you
know
what
i
really
need
to
urinate
maybe
i
should
rough
him
up
a
little
i
am
a
drone
in
the
mind
that
is
evil
i
say
i'm
part
of
the
great
darkness
i'm
only
a
fragment
of
the
we
we
work
as
one
to
serve
the
first
we
work
to
prepare
for
the
inevitable
battle
we
can
feel
the
knife
we
attend
to
the
needs
of
the
infinite
evil
we
exterminate
girls
and
destroy
the
legacy
of
the
slayer
we
build
an
arsenal
beneath
the
dirt
we
obey
the
commands
of
our
teacher
caleb
we
build
weapons
to
prepare
for
the
coming
war
at
the
farthest
edge
of
town
we
are
everywhere
we
are
like
the
ocean's
waves
we
watch
your
efforts
and
are
not
scared
we
will
laugh
at
you
as
you
die
what
the
bananas
you
are
so
lucky
that
you
did
not
just
magically
decapitate
me
i
feel
used
and
violated
and
i
need
a
lozenge
so
it
turned
out
that
all
these
stone
tablets
basically
said
the
same
thing
the
first
and
caleb
are
protecting
something
and—and
we
don't
know
exactly
what
it
is
but
it's
something
powerful
and
they
don't
want
the
slayers
to
get
it
i'm
thinking
it
could
be
a
weapon
and
if
we're
looking
for
an
arsenal—
if
one
is
looking
for
an
arsenal
what
better
place
to
find
a—
it's
a
pleasure
faith
back
to
you
