yeah
then
why
do
i
feel
like
this
well
there's
the
first
who
we
can't
touch
there's
the
'roidrage
vamps
who
are
pretty
much
the
worst
and
theâ€”
oh
hey
so
heyi've
been
reading
this
old
turkish
spell
book
there's
an
old
conjuration
that
the
ancient
turks
used
to
communicate
with
the
dying
there's
a
translation
of
it
i'm
over
it
um
so
the
spell
is
used
to
communicate
with
people
who
can't
talk
um
like
if
a
person
was
dying
this
spell
would
let
them
say
their
goodbyes
or
you
know
gripe
about
how
nobody
came
to
visit
them
would
this
help
us
with
mr
notongue
um
she's
not
here
right
now
what
are
we
looking
for
i
mean
is
there
some
reason
we
should
spy
on
buffy
