and
i
wish
i
had
some
actually
i
think
they
pant
like
dogs
and
i
don't
know
if
this
is
going
to
do
any
good
but
we
have
to
try
everything
they
won't
hallelujah
well
it
does
throw
me
a
tad
i
mean
they're
just—why
they're
barely
more
than
animals
feeding
off
each
other's
flesh—it's
nauseating
but
you
you're
everywhere
you're
in
the
hearts
of
little
children
you're
in
the
souls
of
the
rich
you're
the
fire
that
makes
people
kill
and
hate
the
fire
that
will
cure
the
world
of
weakness
they're
just
sinners
you
are
sin
and
you're
in
me
give
me
strength
no
man
can
have
amen
shouldn't
be
long
now
prophecies
say
one
thing
brute
strength
says
another
we'll
get
it
out
we're
almost
there
well
if
it
ain't
the
prodigal
slayer
no
you're
not
i
lay
one
hand
on
you
and
you're
just
a
dead
little
girl
do
you
have
to
look
like
that
'cause
it's
just
a
little
confusing
you
whore
