i
just
don't
see
why
everyone's
always
picking
on
marie
antoinette
i
can
so
relate
to
her
she
worked
really
hard
to
look
that
good
and
people
just
don't
appreciate
that
kind
of
effort
whatever
they
were
cranky
so
they're
like
'let's
lose
some
heads'
uhhh
that's
fair
and
and
marie
antoinette
cared
about
them
she
was
gonna
let
them
have
cake
