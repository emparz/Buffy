bad
time

someone
down
on
the
'net
i
just
wanna
find
everything
i

records
affiliates
i'm
not
even
sure
what
i'm
looking
for
yet
billy
fordham
are
you
gonna
tell
me
that
i'm
jealous
you
know
i
never
used
to
things
used
to
be
pretty
simple
a
hundred
years
just
hanging
out
feelin'
guilty
i
really
honed
my
brooding
skills
then
she
comes
along
yeah
i
get
jealous
but
i
know
people
and
my
gut
tells
me
this
is
a
wrong
guy
what
he
said
he
was
in
school
with
you
guys
right
don't
tell
buffy
what
we're
doing
alright
just
don't
bring
it
up
until
we
know
what's
what
that'd
be
nice
he
leaves
no
paper
trail
no
records
that's
incriminating
enough
could
you
not
call
me
that
we're
friends
of
ford's
let's
look
around
you
guys
check
out
downstairs
vampires
you're
a
fool
i've
seen
enough
i've
seen
this
type
before
i
mean
they're
children
making
up
bedtime
stories
of
friendly
vampires
to
comfort
themselves
in
the
dark
these
people
don't
know
anything
about
vampires
what
they
are
how
they
live
how
they
dress
buffy
may
i
come
in
i
can
i
was
just
being
polite
we
need
to
talk
it's
about
your
friend
ford
he's
not
what
he
seems
willow
ran
him
down
on
the
computer
we
found
this
address
we
checked
it
out
with
xander
and
it
turned
out
what
are
you
talking
about
some
lies
are
necessary
sometimes
the
truth
is
worse
you
live
long
enough
you
find
that
out
do
you
love
me
do
you
maybe
you
shouldn't
do
either
i
did
a
lot
of
unconscionable
things
when
i
became
a
vampire
drusilla
was
the
worst
she
was
an
obsession
of
mine
she
was
pure
and
sweet
and
chaste
first
i
made
her
insane
killed
everybody
she
loved
visited
every
mental
torture
on
her
i
could
devise
she
eventually
fled
to
a
convent
and
on
the
day
she
took
her
holy
orders
i
turned
her
into
a
demon
ford's
part
of
some
society
that
reveres
vampires
practically
worships
them
i
don't
know
what
he
wants
from
you
but
you
can't
trust
him
