when
buffy
reaches
the
top
of
the
stairs
she
stares
at
spike
for
a
moment
she
looks
at
drusilla
and
shoves
her
down
the
stairs
at
spike
he
catches
and
steadies
her
as
buffy
turns
and
rushes
out
the
door
he
starts
to
give
chase
as
buffy
swings
the
door
shut
behind
her
spike
slams
up
against
it
he
looks
for
the
way
to
open
it
buffy
looks
back
at
the
entrance
cut
inside
the
club
the
vampires
are
banging
on
the
doors
ford
wakes
and
gets
up
holding
his
head
spike
is
comforting
drusilla
