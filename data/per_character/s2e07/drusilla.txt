want
me
to
walk
you
home

mummy
used
to
sing
me
to
sleep
at
night
run
and
catch

the
lamb
is
caught
in
the
blackberry
patch
she
had
the
sweetest
voice
what
will
your
mummy
sing
when
they
find
your
body
oh
well

not
a
person

just
my
angel

you
remember
the
song

used
to
sing

hurt

heart
stinks
of
her
poor
little
thing

has
no
idea

in
store

pet

is
just
the
beginning

the
sweetest
little
song

tummy
