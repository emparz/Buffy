xander
he
was
obviously
in
charge
he
didn't
seem
like
the
type
of
guy
who
would
let
himself
be
used
thinking
so
we're
pretty
sure
that
there're
not
more
tarakan
assassins
coming
our
way
and
you're
loving
playing
nursemaid
i
like
my
new
ninegig
hard
drive

who
can
afford
the
upgrades
you
don't
like
him
he's
a
clean
clown
i
have
my
own
fun
he
has
a
point
separation
anxiety
the
mother
figure
being
taken
away
conflict
with
the
father
figure
xander

kind
of
her
nickname
cookies

him
to
be
corrupt
or
something
what's
up
with
them
different
like
happy
you
know
i
will
what

you
want
me
to
look
for
how
come

criminal
record
damn
this
guy's
like
citizen

secret
ingredient

not
love

i
think
it's
dematorin
it's
like
a
tranquilizer
keeps
you
all
mellow
and
compliant
it
also
shares
a
few
components
with
ecstasy
careful

far
i've
counted
four
marriage
certificates
