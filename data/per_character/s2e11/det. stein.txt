ma'am
i'm
detective
stein
i'm
sorry
but
i
need
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
your
relationship
with
the
deceased
can
you
tell
me
what
happened
i
see
uh
did
he
slip
do
you
know
what
made
him
fall
about
what
was
this
the
first
time
that
you
two
had
had
an
argument
that
was
tonight
where
well
it
doesn't
look
like
he
hit
you
very
hard
so
you've
been
hit
before
but
ted
never
hit
you
before
tonight
ted
never
hit
you
before
tonight
i
believe
you
things
get
outta
hand
he's
a
big
guy
we're
not
bringing
anything
up
against
your
daughter
right
now
she
says
mr
buchanan
struck
her
and
if
that's
the
case
anyway
we've
gotta
examine
it
further
right
now
i
think
you
should
just
take
her
home
and
the
two
of
you
should
try
and
get
some
rest
