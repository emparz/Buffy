hi
yeah
that's
fine
i'll
send
the
kids
by
to
pick
'em
up
pretty
flimsy
excuse
for
coming
by
to
see
me
i'm
doing
pretty
good
actually
i've
stayed
out
of
mortal
danger
for
three
whole
weeks
i
could
get
used
to
it
i'm
still
having
trouble
sleeping
though
or
possibly
space
rupert
i
know
you're
concerned
but
having
you
constantly
poking
around
making
little
puppy
dog
eyes
at
me
wondering
if
i'm
okay
you
make
me
feel
bad
that
i
don't
feel
better
i
don't
want
that
responsibility
worried
i
know
yeah
i
get
that
reaction
from
men
all
the
time
i
saw
your
car
back
there
i
wanted
to
apologize
no
no
please
please
lemme
just
lemme
get
this
out
i
was
sooo
harsh
the
other
day
i
am
so
sorry
i
mean
i
know
how
badly
you
must
feel
about
putting
me
in
danger
before
and
say
good
night
big
guy
oh
god
oh
no
