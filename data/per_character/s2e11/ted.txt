computer's
only
half
a
rocket
ship
well
you
can
i
get
the
demos
for
free
i
don't
see
why
i
shouldn't
give
'em
to
you
for
the
same
price
any
friend
of
buffy's
what
well
after
you
bake
it
you
fry
it
in
herbs
and
olive
oil
but
you
gotta
use
a
castiron
skillet
no
room
for
compromise
there
hungry
buffy
i
want
to
apologize
that

how
i
wanted
us
to
meet
i
wanted
it
to
be
perfect
i'm
very
fond
of
your
mother
i
guess
that's
pretty
obvious
i
know
you're
the
most
important
thing
in
her
life
and
well
gosh
that
makes
you
pretty
important
to
me
too
beg
to
differ
we
really
want
you
to
be
okay
with
this
hello
kids
i'm
updating
the
software
in
the
guidance
office
which
reminds
me
your
upgrades
think
nothing
of
it
buffy
do
you
like
miniature
golf
well
your
mother
and
i
were
thinking
maybe
this
saturday
we
could
drag
the
three
of
you
out
to
the
course
spend
some
time
swinging
the
iron
with
the
stuffy
old
people
i'm
making
a
picnic
basket
and
cookies
great
i
know
i've
been
looking
a
long
time
for
one
so
buffy
i
bet
the
boys
are
lined
up
around
the
block
tryin'
to
get
a
date
with
you
well
glad
to
hear
it
i
bet
that
means
your
grades
will
be
picking
up
soon
keep
your
eye
on
the
ball
watch
those
elbows
oh
bad
luck
little
lady
we
won't
it
is
but
the
rules
are
the
rules
and
what
we
teach
her
is
what
she
takes
out
into
the
world
when
we're
not
there
whether
it's
at
school
or
an
unchaperoned
party
i
don't
mean
to
overstep
my
bounds
this
is
between
you
and
your
mother
i
just
think
right
is
right
beg
to
differ
i
think
you're
missing
the
point
here
little
lady
right
is
right
wrong
is
wrong
why
don't
people
see
that
right
it's
just
a
game
do
your
own
thing
well
i'm
not
wired
that
way
and
i
am
here
to
tell
you
it
is
not
a
game
it
does
count
and
i
don't
stand
for
that
kind
of
malarkey
in
my
house
do
you
want
me
to
slap
that
smartass
mouth
of
yours
who's
up
for
dessert

chocolatechip
cookies

made
uh
too
many
so
you

to
take
some
home
no
mrs
lawnsdale
it
is
not
an
inexpensive
piece
of
software
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
a
very
expensive
one
which
removes
the
risk
of
crashing
your
whole
system
of
course
if
you
prefer
something
cheap
i
can
always
recommend
trust
me
you
