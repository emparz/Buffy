hey
yeah
the
heart
yeah
it
is
kinda
strange
how
you
keep
saving
the
world
and
there's
not
any
proof
or
is
it
important
i
mean
buff
i
don't
get
why
this
is
bothering
you
so
much
i
like
that
one
whoa
what
the
hell
i've
apologized
enough
that's
what
i
have
to
say
well
yes
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
look
anya
if
i
had
married
you
it
would
have
been
against
everything
i
thought
was
best
it
wouldn't
have
worked
i
don't
mean
to
it's
just—you
know
how
i
feel
right
and
you
were
the
one
who
didn't
want
to
keep
seeing
each
other
yes
i
still
love
you
i
always
will
i
just
don't
know
if
that
means
anything
for
us
anymore
well
it's
nice
to
hear
i'm
not
gonna
find
anyone
out
there
like
you
am
i
i
guess
i'm
more
replaceable
obviously
yeah
i
guess
we
fit
together
pretty
good
you
know
sometimes
i
want
to
be
back
in
your
life
i'm
not
gonna
find
anyone
out
there
like
you
am
i
wow
that
was
nice
it's
too
bad
buffy
took
spike's
chains
down
huh
mmm
i
feel
good
yeah
i
knew
we'd
always
do
that
again
is
that
what
that
was
one
more
time
i
don't
know
it
was
nice
it
felt
um—it
felt
like
a
one
more
time
sure
