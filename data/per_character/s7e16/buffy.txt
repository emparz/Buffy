a
waste
of
time
come
on
someone
has
to
agree
with
me
spike
this
isn't
about
keeping
busy
this
is
about
war
i'm
sorry
to
jump
all
over
you
guys
but
i
have
to
tell
you
what's
really
going
on
there's
something
new
amanda
dawn—you're
gonna
stay
home
from
school
today
we
can
survive
what's
coming
but
not
like
this
i
had
a
vision
of
what's
to
come—a
horrible
vision
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
i
mean
mentally
and
from
what
i've
seen
so
far
there's
is
no
way
your
girls
are
ready
you
have
to
not
late
not
late
'til
the
bell
rings
hey
hey
break
it
up
get
to
class
uhoh
hey
shy
girl
don't
do
this
oh
yeah
it's
ok
i
promise
it
may
seem
ba—
whwhwhat's
wrong
hey
uh
i
can
help
you
just
need
to
relax
you
know
you
know
um
maybe
one
of
you
guys
could
give
him
a
foot
rub
something
bad
is
going
on
ooh
you're
hurt
what
happened
yeah
well
it
could
have
been
any
of
them
students
teachers—something
is
going
on
today
everything
there
this
thing
that
happens
here
in
this
school
over
the
hell
mouth
where
the
way
a
thing
feels—it
kind
of
starts
being
that
wayfor
real
i've
seen
all
these
things
beforejust
not
all
at
once
exactly
war
pretty
much
being
in
high
school
can
feel
like
being
at
war
now
it's
true
the
students
feel
like
the
teachers
are
out
to
get
them
the
chess
club
resents
the
french
club
for
taking
the
activities
room
and
well
everybody
hates
the
cheerleaders
if
we
don't
do
something
about
this
we're
gonna
have
a
riot
on
our
hands
and
a
lot
of
other
nasty
stuff
too
really
should
have
had
that
foot
rub
sure
you
know
swim
team
monsters
or
killer
prom
dogs
again
not
all
at
once
my
guess—it's
that
seal
thing
in
the
basement
it's
like
all
the
hellmouth's
energy
is
trying
to
escape
in
that
one
little
spot
and
it's
getting
all—
careful
you're
starting
to
speak
like
me
now
i
swear
we
just
covered
this
thing
up
it's
more
than
that
look
robin
i
um
i
had
a
vision
the
other
day
sometimes
you're
running
to
catch
the
bus
naked
that's
a
dream
army
of
vicious
vampire
creatures
that's
a
vision
also
i
was
awake
hundreds
maybe
hundreds
of
hundreds
all
i
know
is
the
last
ubervamp
i
faced
crawled
out
of
that
very
hole
it
makes
me
awfully
nervous
what
are
you
doing
well
i
know
it's
a
goat
with
its
tongue
out
uh
willow
did
a
search
on
the
symbolic
database
but
it
turns
out
everybody
loves
a
good
goat's
tongue
rock
groups
covens
and
greek
cookbooks
she
said
she
couldn't
narrow
it
down
yes
why
wouldn't
i
trust
her
no
that's
not
true
yeah
willow
had
a
bad
patch
but
i've
never
been
robin
are
you
ok
i—i
think
it
was
controlling
you
i
think
i
have
a
pretty
good
idea
who
we
should
talk
to
the
guy
that
fed
it
it's
first
drop
of
blood
heads
up
andrew
we've
got
to
talk
the
school
is
out
of
control
with
energy
from
the
hellmouth
it's
time
for
you
to
help
andrew
no
no
more
watching
the
seal
thing
is
your
baby
and
you
gotta
get
in
there
before
it
tears
everything
apart
no
zima
you
were
the
first
one
to
uncover
the
seal
and
feed
it
blood
how
did
you
know
it
was
there
how
did
you
know
what
to
do
andrew
stop
it
or
i'm
going
to
smash
this
camera
over
your
head
actually
i'm
gonna
do
that
anyway
so
you
might
as
well
talk
kennedy
search
his
stuff
find
the
knife
will
what're
you
thinking
you
think
you
can
do
something
with
that
guess
what
andy
you
just
won
yourself
a
free
vacation
to
the
beautiful
downtown
hellmouth
look
we
have
to
deal
with
the
seal
right
away
we
already
might
have
to
just
shut
the
school
down
and
i'm
not
losing
any
more
territory
to
the
first
besides
it's
the
only
thing
we've
got
robin
spike
let's
go
riot
that
almost
happened
shh
they'll
hear
you
spike
spike
don't
kill
them
they're
just
students
ok
spike
wood
i
need
you
guys
to
stay
here
hold
our
line
of
retreat
oh
stop
it
no
more
what
i
do
is
too
important
to
show
the
world
be
quiet
i
don't
want
a
biographer
especially
a
murderer
what
you
stabbed
jonathan
to
death
what
were
you
trying
to
do
scratch
his
back
from
the
front
no
i
just
thought
you
would
say
that
i
saw
the
seal
possess
wood
like
that
earlier
today
you
just
completely
changed
your
entire
story
uh
ya
did
too
there's
someone
in
there
no
we're
going
in
just
be
prepared
ok
the
seal
could
have
done
anything
to
them
go
nope
they're
ok
it's
your
turn
andrew
or
we
could
do
this
doesn't
really
make
sense
does
it
bringing
you
here
to
talk
to
it
this
thing
doesn't
understand
words
it
understands
blood
yeah
willow
did
a
little
research
turns
out
the
blood
of
the
person
that
awoke
it—you—different
kind
of
deal
it
reverses
the
whole
thing
i
don't
know
maybe
not
enough
to
kill
you
stop
stop
telling
stories
life
isn't
a
story
shut
up
you
always
do
this
you
make
everything
into
a
story
so
no
one's
responsible
for
anything
because
they're
just
following
a
script
you
didn't
lose
him
you
murdered
him
i
made
it
up
i'm
making
it
all
up
what
kind
of
hero
does
that
make
me
yeah
well
i
don't
like
having
to
give
a
bunch
of
speeches
about
how
we're
all
gonna
live
because
we
won't
this
isn't
some
story
where
good
triumphs
because
good
triumphs
good
people
are
going
to
die
girls
maybe
me
probably
you
probably
right
now
when
your
blood
pours
out
it
might
save
the
world
what
do
you
think
about
that
does
it
buy
it
all
back
are
you
redeemed
why
not
didn't
want
blood
it
wanted
tears
sorry
i
had
to—
i
wasn't
going
to
stab
you
