for
god's
sakes
andrew
you've
been
in
here
for
30
minutes
what
are
you
doing
why
can't
you
just
masturbate
like
the
rest
of
us
birds
need
to
fly
and
girls
need
to
use
the
toilet
and
why
were
you
video
taping
yourself
anyway
sounds
like
kinky
business
to
me
if
there
are
any
buffy
seems
to
think
that
this
apocalypse
is
going
to
actually
be
you
know
apocalyptic
i
think
your—your
story
seems
pretty
pointless
oh
well
balance
is
important
people
don't
always
take
that
into
account
i
could
bring
that
to
you
absolutely
i'll
put
it
on
the
list
yeah
you
know
for
future
generations
that's
what
you're
calling
it
i
know
i
am
what
do
you
have
to
say
for
yourself
one
year
later
of
course
he
doesn't
think
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
what
but
we—we
still
spark
i
mean
i
get
jealous
of
you
you
get
jealous
of
me
you
still
love
me
you
keep
dodging
the
question
and
here's
where
we
hop
on
the
merrygoround
of
rotating
knives
i
blame
you
and
you
blame
me
and
we
both
end
up
all
cut
to
shreds
please
just
tell—
do
you
still
love
me
well
i
love
you
too
i
don't
know
if
that
means
anything
either
doesn't
seem
likely
no
there's
no
one
like
you
xander
you
were
willing
to
stand
up
to
danger
even
when
your
hands
had
no
weapons
you
were
ready
to
protect
me
with
your
life
we
fit
together
great
i
hope
you
know
you
never
left
my
heart
doesn't
seem
likely
wow
wow
certainly
was
you
carpenter
you
you
said
it
well
yeah
i'm
a
spitfire
in
the
bedroom
yeah
one
more
time
anyway
do
you
think
there
should
be
more
i
think
maybe
we're
really
over
which
is—it's
good
right
i
mean
now
we
can
move
on
