respect
the
cruller
and
tame
the
donut
merciful
zeus
it
was
very
disturbing
but
disturbing
and
not
the
natural
order
of
things
and
do
you
think
it'll
happen
again
well
we
just
gotta
break
it
down
look
at
the
factors
before
it
happens
again
because
i
for
one
giles
begins
to
sing
interrupting
xander
i've
got
a
theory
we
should
work
this
out
it
could
be
witches

some
evil
witches

which
is
ridiculous
'cause
witches
they
were
persecuted

wicca
good
and
love
the
earth
and
woman
power

and
i'll
be
over
here
see
okay
that
was
disturbing
so
what'd
you
guys
sing
about
the
what
now
i
bet
they're
not
even
working
willow
and
tara
you
see
the
way
they
were
with
each
other
the
getaroominess
to
them
i
bet
they're
singing
they're
probably
singing
right
now
oh
yeah
you
want
some
breakfast
baby
nah
i
shut
the
crew
down
for
the
day
my
guys
start
dancing
around
me
i
don't
know
if
i
can
deal
it's
a
flab
thing
so
waffles
no
i'll
only
make
them
for
myself
but
by
california
law
you
will
own
half
of
them
hey
how
about
omelettes
i
could
do
an
omelette
i've
almost
got
that
xander
continues
talking
unintelligibly
as
anya
sits
up
and
begins
to
sing
to
the
camera
she
is
the
one

she's
such
wonderful
fun

such
passion
and
grace
warm
in
the
night
when
i'm
right
in
her
tight
embrace
tight
embrace
i'll
never
let
her
go
the
love
we've
known
can
only
grow

there's
just
one
thing
that

no

i'll
never
tell
she
wheezes
she
eats
these
skeezy
cheeses
that
i
can't
describe
she
doesn't
know
what
'please'
is
like
she
thinks
i'm
ordinary
like
her
toes
are
kind
of
hairy
she
clings

she's
needy

she's
also
really
greedy
she
nev
this
is
my
verse
hello

she
you're
quite
the
charmer
you're
the
cutest
of
the
scoobies

with
your
lips
as
red
as
rubies

and
your
firm
yet
supple
tight
embrace
she's
sweller
that's
why
i'll
never
tell
her
that
i'm
petrified
is
she
looking
for
a
pot
of
gold
will
our
lives
become
too
stressful
if
i'm
never
that
successful
am
i
crazy
am
i
marrying
a
demon
my
lips
are
sealed
nothing
to
see

move
it
along
it's
a
nightmare
it's
a
plague
it's
like
a
nightmare
about
a
plague
it's
like
i
didn't
wanna
be
saying
things
anya
like
there
was
a
wall
missing
xander
but
they
just
kept
pouring
out
and
they
rhymed
and
they
were
mean
and
anya
like
there
were
only
three
walls
and
not
a
fourth
wall
and
xander
my
eyes
are
not
beady
giles

got
to
stop

me
an
axe
and
show
me
where
to
point

as
in
burnt
up

set
people
on
fire
that's
nuts
okay
but
we're
sure
that
the
things
are
related
the
singing
and
dancing
and
burning
and
dying
plan
schman
let's
mount
up
spike
sing
a
widdle
song

it
go

i
didn't
know
what
was
gonna
happen

just
thought

gonna
be
dances
and
songs
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure

happy
