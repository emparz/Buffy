that's
entertainment
why'd
you
run
away

don't
you
like
my

style
why
don't
you
come
and
play

i
guarantee
a
great
big
smile

the
mouth
disappears
from
his
hand
and
reappears
in
its
normal
place
i
come
from
the

imagination

and
i'm
here
strictly
by
your

invocation
so
what
do
you
say

why
don't
we
dance
awhile
i'm
the
hot
swing

i'm
the
twist
and
shout
when
you
gotta
sing

when
you
gotta

let
it
out
you
call
me
and
i
come
arunning
i
turn
the
music
on

i
bring
the
fun
in
now
we're
partyin'

that's
what
it's
all
about
'cause
i
know

what
you
feel
girl
i
know
just
what
you
feel
girl
all
these
melodies

they
go
on
too
long

then
that
energy
starts
to
come
on
way
too
strong

all
those
hearts
laid
open
that
must
sting
plus
some
customers
just
start
combusting
that's
the
penalty
when
life
is
but
a
song
you
brought
me
down
into
this
town

so
when
we
blow
this
scene

back
we
will
go
to
my
kingdom
below

and
you
will
be
my
queen
'cause
i
know
what
you
feel
girl
i'll
make
it
real
girl
i
can
bring
whole
cities
to
ruin

and
still
have
time
to
get
a
softshoe
in
something's
cooking
i'm
at
the
griddle

i
bought
nero
his
very
first
fiddle
the
slayer
find
her
tell
her

tell
her
everything
just
get
her
here
i
want
to
see
the
slayer
burn
now
we're
partying
that's
what
it's
all
about
'cause
she
is
drawn
to
the
fire

some
people
these
endless
days
are
finally
ending
in
a
blaze
she
will
come
to
me
showtime
i
love
a
good
entrance
i've
got
a
hundred
what
if
i
kill
you
hm
that's
gloomy
come
now
is
that
really
what
you
feel
isn't
life
a
miraculous
thing
now
that
was
a
showstopping
number
not
quite
the
fireworks
that
i
was
looking
for
mm
i
smell
power
i
guess
the
little
missus
and
i
should
be
on
our
way
i
don't
make
the
rules
she
summoned
me
you
have
my
talisman
on
sweet
thing
well
now
that's
a
twist
i
think
everything
worked
out
just
fine
it's
tempting
but
i
think
we'll
waive
that
clause
just
this
once
big
smiles
everyone
you
beat
the
bad
guy
what
a
lot
of
fun

you
guys
have
been
real
swell
and
there's
not
a
one

who
can
say
this
ended
well
all
those
secrets
you've
been
concealing
say
you're
happy
now

once
more
with
feeling

now
i
gotta
run

see
you
all
in
heeeeeeell
