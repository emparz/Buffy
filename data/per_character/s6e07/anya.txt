that's
still
funny
sweetie
and
we
were
arguing
and
and
then
everything
rhymed
and
there
were
harmonies
and
the
dance
with
coconuts
i've
got
a
theory
it
could
be
bunnies
bunnies
aren't
just
cute
like
everybody
supposes

they've
got
them
hoppy
legs
and
twitchy
little
noses

and
what's
with
all
the
carrots

what
do
they
need
such
good
eyesight
for
anyway
bunnies

bunnies

it
must
be
bunnies
or
maybe
midgets
except
for
bunnies
well
is
it
just
us
i
mean
is
it
only
happening
to
us
'cause
that
would
probably
mean
a
spell
or
buffy
goes
to
the
door
opens
it
the
bell
jingles
oh
my
god
did
it
sing
you
don't
have
to
go
to
work
will
you
still
make
me
waffles
when
we're
married
this
is
the
man
that
i
plan
to
entangle

isn't
he
fine

my
claim
to
fame
was
to
maim
and
to
mangle

vengeance
was
mine

but
i'm
out
of
the
biz

the
name
i
made
i'll
trade
for
his

the
only
trouble
is
i'll
never
tell
he
snores
say
'housework'
and
he
freezes
i
talk
he
breezes
his
penis
got
diseases
from
a
chumash
tribe
like
it's
all
just
temporary
when
things
get
rough
he

just
hides
behind
his
buffy
now
look
he's
getting
huffy

'cause
he
knows
that
i
know
his
eyes
are
beady
look
at
me
i'm
dancing
crazy
my
knight
in
armor
he's
swell
he'll
always
be
my
feller
i've
read
this
tale

there's
wedding
then
betrayal

i
know
there'll
come
the
day
i'll
want
to
run
and
hide
will
i
look
good
when
i've
gotten
old
when
i
get
so
worn
and
wrinkly
that
i
look
like
david
brinkley
am
i
dreamin'
i
take
the
fifth
it
has
to
be
stopped
it
was
like
we
were
being
watched
in
our
apartment
my
toes
are
not
hairy
i
don't
know
one
more
verse
of
our
little
ditty
and
i
would've
been
looking
for
a
gas
can
uh
dawn
may
have
had
the
wrong
idea
in
summoning
this
creature
but

i've
seen
some
of
these
underworld
child
bride
deals
and
and
they
never
end
well
well
maybe
once
would
you
say
it
was
a
breakaway
pop
hit
or
more
of
a
book
number
beady
eyes
is
right
we're
needed

or
we
could
just
sit
around
and
glare
she
came
from
the
grave
much
graver
xander
