we
have
to
try

we'll
pay
the
price

it's
do
or
die
what
can't
we
face
if
we're
together
what's
in
this
place
that
we
can't
weather
there's
nothing
we
can't
face
understand
we'll
go
hand
in
hand
but
we'll
walk
alone
in
fear
where
do
we
go
from
here

when
does
the
end
appear
when
do
the
trumpets
cheer

the
curtains
close
on
a
kiss
god
knows
we
can
tell
the
end
is
near
where
do
we
go
from
here
where
do
we
go
from
here
