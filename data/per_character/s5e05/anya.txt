your
conjuring
powder
is
grotesquely
overpriced
i'm
sorry
i'm
nearly
out
of
money
i've
never
had
to
afford
things
before
and
it's
making
me
bitter
well
you're
getting
ripped
off
i
could
hook
you
up
with
the
troll
that
sheds
it
please
go
but
i
have
their
money
who
cares
what
kind
of
day
they
have
hey
you
have
a
nice
day
sure
if
you
wrapped
it
with
your
feet
you
know
buffy
there
used
to
be
this
french
sorcerer
back
in
the
16th
idon'tknowwhat
named
so
cute
in
his
little
knickers
but
he
had
this
one
spell
demons
just
hated
called
tirer
la
couture
a
spell
to
see
spells
well
a
trance
to
see
spells
actually
but
you
get
the
idea
try
that
or
a
cloud
of
mist
around
her
you're
out
of
crystal
balls
those
babies
are
really
popular
with
the
amateurs
better
restock
and
raise
the
price
10
make
it
15
your
cash
register
looks
like
squirrels
nest
in
it
and
the
hand
of
glory
packs
some
serious
raw
power
better
institute
a
sevenday
background
check
for
okay
okay
boss
