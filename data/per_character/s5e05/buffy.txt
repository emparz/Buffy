and
i've
always
wanted
piano
lessons
so
really
who's
surprised
we
have
all
this
unexpressed
rage

honestly
i
think
i'm
expressing
mine
better
tell
you
what
you
find
yourself
a
good
anger
management
class
and
i'll
jam
this
pokey
wood
stick
through
your
heart
i
think
that
sets
the
world
speed
record
for
closure
oh
right
yeah
darn
my
fellow
ravers
will
be
so
disappointed
it
was
my
turn

the
bundt
cake

lessthangreat
so
well
what
did
the
doctor
say

good
thing

and
we
have
no
idea
what
the
deal
is
yeah

highly
trained
medical
staff

little
scoobycentric
deal

yeah
thanks
not
yet
but
she
will

i'm
starting
to
figure

what's
wrong
giles
i
have
an
idea
what's
making
my
mom
sick
they
won't
find
anything
what's
hurting
her
it's
supernatural
the
night
watchman
who
found
this
thing
he
went
crazy
like
overnight
it
won't
hurt
us
i
had
it
on
me
all
night
but
this
guy
he
saw
things
he
said
things
they'll
come
at
me
through
my
family
i
don't
know
yet
but
whatever
touched
this
guy
it
made
him
see
through
what
the
rest
of
us
are
seeing
he
knew
someone's
hurting
my
mom
and
they're
trying
to
get
to
me

it's
a
start
we
need
to
find
out
who's
making
my
mom
sick
and
how
then
i
hunt
them
find
them
and
kill
them
someone
put
a
spell
on
my
mom
something
to
make
it
seem
like
