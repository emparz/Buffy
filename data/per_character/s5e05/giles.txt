our
new
slogan
since
nine
this
morning
actually
still
not
to
worry
no
i've
got
feelings
about
this
place
magick's
a
small
niche
market
but
well
think
about
it
sunnydale
monsters
supply
and
demand
they'll
be
lining
up
around
the
block
in
no
time
you
all
right
you
seem
a
little
distracted
she
is
getting
medical
attention
i'm
sorry
still
you
know
time
and
patience
both
great
comforts
it
appears
to
be
paranormal
in
origin
well
it's
so
shiny
of
course
yes
if
any
customers
do
thank
you
for
choosing
to
shop
at
the
magic
box
and
please
do
come
again
did
you
see
that
customers
real
live
customers
they
came
in
and
i
gave
them
things
and
they
gave
me
money
and
then
they
left
it's
brilliant
well
we'll
just
have
to
keep
trying
if
there's
anything
you
need
help
with
let
me
know
anya
the
change
is
palpable
that
stuff
doesn't
come
cheap
have
you
spoken
with
her
doctors
such
as
who
will
it's
possible
but
still
the
ramblings
of
a
madman
aren't
much
to
go
on
no
no
ground
cloven
hooves
are
30
off
the
whole
ones
are
full
price
that's
not
candy
xander
there's
too
many
of
them
people
and
they
all
seem
to
want
things
cloutier
well
all
spells
leave
a
trace
signature
it's
just
not
perceptible
to
the
human
eye
in
this
case
it
could
be
the
image
of
a
hand
choking
your
mother
possible
yes
yes
buffy
the
sorcerer
cloutier
was
legendary
his
skills
at
achieving
higher
states
of
consciousness
were
are
you
ready
buffy
oh
i'm
glad
i've
caught
you
i
think
we
may
have
underestimated
what
we're
dealing
with
we've
uncovered
more
than
expected
about
this
orb
it's
called
the
dagon
sphere
and
it
has
a
history
going
back
many
centuries
it's
a
protective
device
used
to
ward
off
ancient
primordial
evil
unfortunately
no
this
is
where
excuse
me
this
is
where
accounts
get
vague
all
we've
managed
to
uncover
so
far
is
the
dagon
sphere
was
created
to
repel
that
which
cannot
be
named
buffy
you've
heard
me
say
this
before
but
do
be
careful
anything
that
goes
unnamed
is
usually
an
object
of
deep
worship
or
great
fear
maybe
both
have
you
completed
the
trance
seen
what's
harming
your
mother
yes
would
someone
please
rip
that
bloody
bell
off
its
hinges
i
think
i
liked
it
better
when
demons
would
just
crash
in
here
and
tear
the
place
apart
just
seemed
so
much
simpler
anya
anya
anya
would
you
like
a
job
good
then
we
can
talk
shop
tomorrow
she
said
it
didn't
work
now
she's
off
investigating
whoever
left
the
dagon
sphere
behind
no
no
i
just
hope
she
isn't
doing
anything
too
rash
