our
lives
aren't
important
we
have
to
protect
the
key
the
beast
zabbij
me
zabbij
me
i
will
tell
you
nothing
stop
please
my
journey's
done
i
think
you
have
to
the
key
you
must
protect
the
key
many
more
die
if
you
don't
keep
it
safe
the
key
is
energy
it's
a
portal
it
opens
the
door
no
for
centuries
it
had
no
form
at
all
my
brethren
its
only
keepers
then
the
abomination
found
us
we
had
to
hide
the
key
gave
it
form
molded
it
flesh
made
it
human
and
sent
it
to
you
she's
the
key
we
knew
the
slayer
would
protect
we
built
them
you
cannot
abandon
human
now
human
and
helpless
please
she's
an
innocent
in
this
she
needs
you
she
doesn't
know
that
