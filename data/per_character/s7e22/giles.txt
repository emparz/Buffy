caleb
it's
a
lot
more
than
that
buffy
what
you
said
it—it
flies
in
the
face
of
everything
we've
ever—every
generation
has
ever
done
in
the
fight
against
evil
i
think
it's
bloody
brilliant
if
you
want
my
opinion
you
can
do
this
willow
we'll
get
the
coven
on
the
line
and
we'll
find
out
how
they
can
help
yes
you
do
i'll
go
dig
up
my
sources
quite
literally
actually
i'm—i'm—i'm
all
turned
around
you're
here
that
puts
me
over
by
the
door
demons
around
the
perimeter—
right
i
open
the
door
oh
bugger
it
fight
well
wait
a
minute
what
about
my
bag
of
illusions
could
it
possibly
get
uglier
i
used
to
be
a
highly
respected
watcher
and
now
i'm
a
wounded
dwarf
with
the
mystical
strength
of
a
doily
i
just
wish
i
could
sleep
teams
of
2
then
i
suggest
you
and
i
take
the
lounge
i
think
we
can
do
better
than
that
well
now
aren't
we
gonna
discuss
this
save
the
world
to
go
to
the
mall
here
i
am
invisible
to
the
eye
the
earth
is
definitely
doomed
everybody
this
way
i
don't
understand
who
did
this
there
is
another
one
in
cleveland
not
to
spoil
the
moment
yes
because
the
mall
was
actually
in
sunnydale
so
there's
no
hope
of
going
there
tomorrow
we
have
a
lot
of
work
ahead
of
us
