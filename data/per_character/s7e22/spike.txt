sowhere's
tall
dark
and
forehead
yeah
that
and
i
also
used
my
enhanced
vampire
eyeballs
to
watch
you
kissing
him
most
people
don't
use
their
tongues
to
say
hello
or
i
guess
they
do
but—
oh
just
popped
by
for
a
quickie
then
he
wears
lifts
you
know
no
problem
at
this
end
where's
the
trinket
the
pretty
necklace
your
sweetiebear
gave
you
the
one
with
all
the
power
i
believe
it's
mine
now
someone
with
a
soul
but
more
than
human
angel
meant
to
wear
it
that
means
i'm
the
qualified
party
you'll
be
needing
someone
strong
to
bear
it
then
you
planning
on
giving
it
to
andrew
been
called
a
lot
of
things
in
my
time
well
you're
not
staying
here
you
can't
buy
me
off
with
shiny
beads
and
sweet
talk
you
got
angel
breath
i'm
not
gonna
just
let
you
whack
me
back
and
forth
like
a
rubber
ball
i've
got
my
pride
you
know
clearly
you
don't
'cause
the
whole
having
my
pride
thing
was
just
a
smokescreen
i
don't
know
what
i
would
have
done
if
you'd
have
gone
up
those
stairs
i'm
drowning
in
footwear
weird
dream
buffy
is
something
wrong
not
to
be
a
buzzkill
love
but
my
fabulous
accessory
isn't
exactly
tingling
with
power
i'm
getting
zero
juice
here
and
i
look
like
elizabeth
taylor
buffy
whatever
this
thing
does
i
think
it's—
oh
bollocks
buffy
i
can
feel
it
buffy
my
soul
it's
really
there
kind
of
stings
go
on
then
no
you've
beat
them
back
it's
for
me
to
do
the
cleanup
gotta
move
lamb
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
school's
out
for
bloody
summer
i
mean
it
i
gotta
do
this
no
you
don't
but
thanks
for
saying
it
now

i
wanna
see
how
it
ends
