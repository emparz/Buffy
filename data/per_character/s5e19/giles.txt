yes
i
suppose
you
are
in
a
manner
of
speaking
you
were
born
here

your
mortal
self
appalling
almost
as
if
they
no
longer
think
money
can
buy
happiness
i
trust
everything
went
well
at
the
university
you're
just
going
to
have
to
put
your
foot
down
with
her
no
buffy
i
don't
think
i
can
just
like
you
always
have
well
then
perk
up
your
ears
i
may
be
a
grownup
but
you're
her
family

only
real
family

needs
you
to
do
this

the
spirit

isn't
a
return
everyone
wants
petrified
hamsters
and
they're
never
happy
with
them

your
good
mood
is
both
obvious
and
contagious

sorry
you
two
don't
quarrel
much

you
well
now
it's
over
the
quarrel
is
over

you'll
feel
better
when
you've
made
your
apologies
and
you'll
know
that
you
can
fight
without
the
world
ending
i
know
it
all
seems
bleak
now
but
as
they
say
this
too
shall
pass
now
