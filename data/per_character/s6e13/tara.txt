i'm
late
i
have
this
sudden
urge
to
dedicate
my
productive
cooperation
is
it
bad
i
knew
this
was
gonna
happen
what
did
willow
do
now
did
she

she
hurt
anyone
ii
thought
that's
why
you
didn't
want
to
meet
at
the
house
good
that's

that's
good
so
so
what
do
you
want
to
talk
about
oh
my
god
hihis
chip
stopped
working
you
think
it's
you
no
buffy
that's
nnot

no
you
didn't
there's
a
monkey
problem
uh
yeah
i
was
just
no
i
wouldn't

i
was
just
looking
for
buffy
i'm
sure
she
feels
the
same
way
if
you
see
her
ccan
you
tell
her
that
i
need
to
talk
to
her
it's
important
thanks
will
i'm

i'm
glad
you're
doing
better
ii've
double
checked
everything
there's
nothing
wrong
with
you
well
i
said
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
you
but

you
are
different
shifting
you
out
of

fffrom
where
you
were

funneling
your
essence
back
into
your
body

iit
it
altered
you
on
a
basic
molecular
level
probably
just
enough
to
confuse
the
sensors
or
whatever
in
spike's
chip
but
it's
all
just
surfacey
physical
stuff
it
wouldn't
have
any
more
effect
than

a
bad
sunburn
no
you're
the
same
buffy
with
a
deep
tropical
cellular
tan
buffy
ii
promise
there's
nothing
wrong
with
you
you
mean
hit
you
oh
oh
huh
really
i
won't
i
won't
tell
anyone
i
wouldn't
do
that
do
you
love
him
iit's
okay
if
you
do
he's
done
a
lot
of
good
and
and
he
does
love
you
aand
buffy
it's
okay
if
you
don't
you're
going
through
a
really
hard
time
and
you're
it's
not
that
simple
