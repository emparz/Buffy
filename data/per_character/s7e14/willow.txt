so
he
asked
you
out
to
dinner
yeah
sure
you're
a
frisky
vixen
oh
right
thatâ€”that
makes
sense
too
well
you'll
have
to
dress
for
the
ambiguity
not
really
a
shower
buff
if
he's
really
interested
are
you
interested
back
i'm
gonna
wait
for
that
sentence
to
come
around
again
before
i
jump
on
right
help
you
move
on
no
ii
meant
move
on
from
this
imposed
superselfreliance
let
somebody
get
close
buffy
got
a
date
which
is
like
100
years
younger
than
your
type
i
think
they're
gonna
end
up
making
out
oh
principal
wood
she'll
gasp
i
love
your
lack
of
wicked
energy
how
'bout
yours
xander

she
evil

like
you
found
her
some
stuff
yeah
sure
want
me
to
check
your
girl
out
while
i'm
at
it
xand
i've
googled
'til
i
just
can't
google

not
in
there
what's
this
you
showed
her
these
in
the
meanwhile
wanna
help
us
get
researchy
we're
trying
to
invade
buffy's
date's
privacy
actually
buffy's
investigating
principal
wood
it's
not
a
date
might
be
a
date
wait
i'm
hearing
something
so
we're
thinking
it
didn't
go
too
well
to
study
it
to
see
if
we
could
figure
something
out
from
what
it
was
saying
because
guys
we
have
to
face
it
we
know
nothing
about
the
first
i'll
call
no
it's
a
text
message
oh
it's
from
xander
it's
one
of
our
signals
yeah
the
system
we
set
up
a
while
back
like
codes
uh
this
one's
either
i
just
got
lucky
don't
call
me
for
a
while
or
my
date's
a
demon
who's
trying
to
kill
me
it
was
a
long
time
ago
that's
ok
we
don't
even
know
where
she
went
that's
not
good
his
slut
didn't
eat
him
up
and
besides
i
thought
you
were
all
angry
at
him
what
happened
what
