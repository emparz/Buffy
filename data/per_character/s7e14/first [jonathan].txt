you
don't
need
a
manual
it's
intuitive
there's
a
button
marked
clock
set
for
pity's
sake
what
kind
of
a
nerd
are
you
no
wonder
you
crashed
your
jet
pack
look
you
monkey
ooh
ahh
it
burns
as
it
ineffectually
passes
through
me
i'm
not
corporeal
remember
also
not
a
vampire
so—a
cross
i
have
an
assignment
for
you
really
why
so
you
can
earn
a
spot
on
her
little
pep
squad
you
think
she'll
ever
let
you
in
you're
a
murderer
interesting
and
you're
the
only
one
she
makes
seek
redemption
does
that
seem
fair
to
you
you
know
we're
headed
toward
a
fight
don't
you
what
do
you
think
the
world's
gonna
be
like
after
that
newsflash
there's
not
going
to
be
a
slayer
gang
anymore
but
there
is
going
to
be
evil
and
as
long
as
there
is
evil
i
live
and
as
long
as
i
live
you
can
dwell
at
my
side
your
assignment
won't
be
hard
they're
just
little
girls
uh
no
not
all
of
them
not
dawn
not
anya
not
willow
and
not
your
friend
buffy
just
the
potential
slayers
she
can't
see
me
and
i'm
gonna
keep
talking
until
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say
so
listen
up
ok
the
girls
must
die
you
don't
have
to
stab
this'll
be
easy
andrew
i
want
you
to
think
willow
brought
something
to
this
house—something
good
something
you
can
use
the
gun
i
want
you
to
think
hard
where
did
they
put
the
gun
did
you
find
the
gun
show
me
show
me
the
gun
great
there's
gonna
be
panic
and
fleeing
when
you
start
firing
so
you're
gonna
have
to
get
them
trapped
someplace
like
the
basement
because
they're
the
future
of
the
slayer
line
when
they're
gone
the
line
is
gone
it's
not
time
for
him
yet
you
can
wait
for
the
next
time
they're
training
in
the
basement
but
don't
rely
on
a
locked
door
to
keep
them
in
you'll
need
more
what
are
you
asking
you're
asking
a
lot
of
questions
are
you
wearing
a
wire
you
think
you
can
trick
the
first
you
think
you
could
squirm
free
i
hold
you
andrew
i
made
you
do
this
jonathan
suffered
he
was
your
friend
and
he
trusted
you
and
now
he
spends
eternity
in
pain
because
of
what
you
did
this
is
what
you
did
to
him
took
away
everything
he
was
and
left
him
like
this
you
started
down
a
road
with
that
action
you
have
to
keep
going
you're
gonna
pay
for
more
than
that
do
you
know
why
because
the
biggest
baddest
first
evil
in
the
world's
angry
with
you
so
many
dead
girls
there'll
be
so
many
