i
understand
i'll
take
care
of
i—
it
was
uh
extraordinary
good
luck
of
course
and—and
uh
training—years
of
training
chaoahn
keep
up
you're
new
here
chaoahn
so
take
note
remember
about
training
but
i
honestly
feel
the
largest
part
of
it
was
instinct
instinct
andand
reflexes
there's
a
sort
of
wary
watchfulness
i've
developed
over
the
years
it's
like
another
sense—
spike
hey
what
then
what
the
hell
did
you
tackle
me
for
you
berk
what's
that
supposed
to
do
more
importantly
you
just
hit
me
why
didn't
your
chip
go
off
you
had
it
remov—you
removed
the
chip
you
know
this
is
very
dangerous
that's
not
what
i'm
talking
about
i
have
to
ask—why
on
earth
did
you
make
that
decision
i
made
that
up
i
knew
the
bringer
was
there
because
his
shoes
squeaked
buffy
it's
crucial
that
we
keep
these
girls
safe
i
can't
count
the
dangers—the
first
the
bringers
random
demons
and
now
spike
what
oh
well
that
sounds
very
responsible
of
you
balances
out
the
vampireontheloose
issue
we
have
no
idea
if
his
chip
was
working
then
a
new
chip
might
restrain
him
should
the
first
attempt
to
activate
him
again
buffy
buffy
i
want
more
for
you
your
feelings
for
him
are
coloring
your
judgement
i
can
hear
it
in
your
voice
and
that
way
lies
a
future
filled
with
pain
i
don't
want
that
for
you
it
doesn't
matter
if
you're
not
physical
with
each
other
anymore
there's
a
connection
you
rely
on
him
he
relies
on
you
that's
what's
affecting
your
judgment
well
i
hope
you're
right
you're
gambling
with
a
lot
of
lives
dear
lord
i
hate
that
mall
the
shop
assistants
are
rude
and
everything
in
the
food
court
is
sticky
oh
hello
yes
yes
and
the
language
barrier
is
formidable
i
was
concerned
that
my
mandarin
is
a
little
thin
but
as
it
turns
out
she
speaks
cantonese
which
is
thinner
but
we
muddled
through
and
as
i
suspected
ice
cream
is
a
universal
language
she's
grateful
to
be
in
the
land
of
plenty
let's
um
go
and
put
away
your
new
clothes
anya
calm
down
they're
educational—
those
are
flashcards
ii
made
them
to
facilitate
her
training
chaoahn
never
had
a
watcher
the
language
problem—
i
wanted
her
to
understand
the
seriousness
of
her
situation
perhaps
i'll
rethink
the
approach
buffy
has
a
date
really
for
god's
sake
how
can
anyone
think
about
their
social
life
we
are
about
to
fight
the
original
primal
evil
these
girls
are
in
mortal
danger
didn't
you
see
the
flashcards
this
isn't
right
getting
back
to
spike's
question
why
did
you
try
to
recall
it
this
proves
my
point
this
time
is
crucial
we
should
be
circling
the
wagons
instead
of
doing
things
like
going
out
on
dates
when—when
gunplay
is
imminent
willow
call
buffy
get
her
back
here
we
need
to
dispose
of
the
gun
andand
figure
out
our
next
move
something's
eating
xander's
head
they're
not
back
yet
it
is
late
perhaps
a
little
reconnaissance
might
be
helpful
she
says
she
can't
sleep
um
i
made
myself
some
warm
milk
you
can
have
it
she's
shy
children
enough
enough
have
you
learned
nothing
from
tonight's
assorted
chaos
there
isn't
time
for
fun
and
games
and
quips
about
orientation
these—these
aren't
a
joke
this—this
happens
girls
are
going
to
die
we
may
die
it's
time
to
get
serious
