i'm
a
very
delicate
person
it's
a
little
out
of
my
element
but
i
can
get
you
what
you
need
i
know
a
beast
who
knows
a
guy
well
this
guy's
worked
your
town
before
and
if
he
lives
up
to
his
rep
this
place'll
be
in
flames
demand's
high
that's
the
reason
i
love
this
country
you
make
a
good
product
and
the
people
will
come
to
you
of
course
a
lot
of
them
are
gonna
die
but
that's
the
other
reason
i
love
this
country
hey
don't
sample
the
product
i
don't
now
i
know
no
one
else
will
we're
getting
close
keep
it
flowing
it's
almost
feeding
time
come
on
big
guy
they're
not
getting
any
fresher
ordinarily
i
like
other
people
to
do
my
fighting
for
me
but
i
just
gotta
see
what
you
got
you
and
me
girl
there's
hard
times
ahead
paid
him
the
man
did
his
job
no
reason
to
burn
that
bridge
where's
the
downside
you
just
got
yourself
one
less
demon
you
have
to
pay
tribute
to
the
way
i
see
it
i
did
you
a
favor
