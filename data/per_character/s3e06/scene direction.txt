at

is
high
above

angled
down
sharply
on

sitting
on
a
blanket
with
her
legs
covered
by
another
one
and
giles
behind
a
nearby
gravestone
he
has
a
book
open
and
reads
from

as
the
camera
pans
down
and
pulls
in
until
it
is
level
with
him

looks
down
at
her

and
fills
in

bubble
with
her
no

back
at

book
she
sees
a
vampire
approach
behind
him
she
tosses
her
notebook
and
answer
sheet
off
of
her
lap
and
scrambles
out
from
under
her
blanket
and
to
her
feet
giles
looks
up
he
sees
her
rushing
toward
him
instantly
realizes
that
he
needs
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
shoulder
rolls
onto
the
ground
out
of
danger
buffy
vaults
herself
over
the
gravestone
finishing
in
a
roundoff
to
the
ground
and
without
a
moment's
hesitation
side
kicks
the
advancing
vampire
in
the
stomach
he
goes
flying
backward
landing
hard
on
his
back
buffy
rushes
him
grabs
his
legs
and
pushes
them
up
forcing
him
into
a
back
roll
away
from
her
the
vampire
ends
up
in
a
standing
position
and
tries
to
punch
her
but
misses
her
entirely
she
tries
a
punch
but
he
middle
blocks
her
and
takes
a
swing
with
his
free
hand
at
her
face
she
ducks
both
it
and
the
next
punch
he
throws
she
straightens
back
up
and
roundhouse
kicks
him
in
the
side
but
he
keeps
his
balance
and
tries
to
roundhouse
kick
her
in
turn
she
ducks
it
and
his
momentum
carries
him
around
in
a
spin
he
comes
to
a
stop
facing
her
and
tries
to
punch
her
in
the
face
but
she
grabs
onto
his
arm
and
blocks
his
next
punch
he
brings
his
free
hand
up
again
but
she
smashes
her
forearm
down
to
block
it
seeing
an
opening
buffy
takes
her
pencil
and
stabs
him
cleanly
in
the
chest

pulls
it
back
out
and
the
vampire
bursts
into
ashes

starts
back
to

with
a
little
smile
on

lips

smile
