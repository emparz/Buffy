what
orders
you're
following
and
now
the
government's
knocking
themselves
out
to
kiss
it
and
make
it
better
maybe
you
even
believe
it
you're
sure
you
got
the
fix
for
it

the
government
get
whimsical
with
my
innards
again

could
do
anything

bestcase
scenario

can't
touch
you
every
day

little
further
