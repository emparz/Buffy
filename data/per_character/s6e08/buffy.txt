a
kid
here
dawn
a
teenager
a
teenager
and
we

there
did
you

see
that
monsters
are

get
your
hands
off

we

buffy
struggling
with
the
other
vamp
he
puts
his
hand
over
her
mouth
hey
stay
away
from
randy
uh

i
i

superhero

something
okay
i've
got
a
plan
they
seem
to
want
randy

i
seem
to
be
pretty
strong
wicked
strong
so
you
guys
go
through
the
sewers
to
get
to
the
hospital
and
randy
and
i'll
give
the
monsters
a
run
for
their
money
yes

work
on
that
then
we
need
to
go
ready
randy
randy
you
don't
know
who
you
are
check
the
lumpies
and
the
teeth
i
kill
your
kind
a
vampire
with
a
soul
oh
my
god
how
lame
is
that
depends
on
how
long
you
keep
on
yapping
note
to
self
learn
to
duck
don't
mess
with
joan
the
v
buffy
suddenly
pauses
stands
still
with
a
small
frown
as
her
memories
return
