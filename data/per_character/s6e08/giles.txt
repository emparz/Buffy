if
there's
something
comes
up
that
you
feel
that
you
can't

i'll
step
in
because
because

because
i
can't
bear
to
see
you
suffer
believe
me
i'm
loathe
to
cause
you
more
but
this
i've
taught
you
all
i
can
about
being
a
slayer
and
your
mother
taught
you
what
you
needed
to
know
about
life
you

you're
not
gonna
trust
that
until
you're
forced
to
stand
alone
now
more
than
ever
the
temptation
to
give
up
is
gonna
be
overwhelming
and
i
can't
let
buffy
so
i
won't
no
giving
up
you
can
be
here
and
i
can
still
be
strong

the
right
thing
to
do

been
through
this
before

you
just
jump
to
the
chase
tell
them
that
you're
the
door

in
sizzling
slightly
from
the
sunlight

sartorial
humor

it'll
all
be
right
