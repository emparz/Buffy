this
is
madness
what
can
you
have
been
thinking
you
are
the
slayer
lives
depend
upon
you
i
make
allowances
for
your
youth
but
i
expect
a
certain
amount
of
responsibility
and
instead
of
which
you
enslave
yourself
to
this
this
i
d
do
you
um
do
you
ignore
everything
i
say
as
a
as
a
rule
you
have
a
sacred
birthright
buffy
you
were
chosen
to
destroy
vampires
not
to
wave
pompoms
at
people
and
as
the
watcher
i
forbid
it
well
i
i
imagine
not
no
quite
spontaneous
human
combustion
is
is
rare
and
and
scientifically
unexplainable
but
there
have
been
cases
for
hundreds
of
years
usually
all
that's
left
is
a
pile
of
ashes
but
that's
the
thrill
of
living
on
the
hellmouth
there's
a
veritable
cornucopia
of
of
fiends
and
devils
and
and
ghouls
to
engage
pardon
me
for
finding
the
glass
half
full
uh
rage
in
most
cases
the
person
who
combusted
was
was
terribly
angry
or
or
upset
well
then
we
have
to
determine
who
or
what
did
and
uh
deal
with
it
accordingly
witchcraft
blinding
your
enemy
to
disorient
and
disable
them
is
it's
classic
why
should
someone
want
to
harm
cordelia
and
setting
amber
ablaze
someone
doesn't
like
cheerleading
uh
let
me
make
sure
i
have
this
right
this
witch
is
casting
horrible
and
disfiguring
spells
so
that
she
can
become
a
cheerleader
i
think
we
should
be
sure
she's
the
witch
before
we
arouse
her
suspicions
she's
she's
capable
of
some
fairly
unpleasant
things
have
you
all
quite
finished
we
have
to
find
a
conclusive
test
'heat
ingredients
and
apply
to
witch
and
if
a
spell
has
been
cast
in
the
previous
48
hours
witch's
skin
turns
blue'
hmm
oh
and
you'll
need
some
eye
of
newt
they
can't
help
her
this
is
a
bloodstone
vengeance
spell
hits
the
body
hard
like
a
a
quart
of
alcohol
and
then
it
eeradicates
the
uh
immune
system
the
others
she
just
wanted
out
of
the
running
you
she
intends
to
um
oh
uh
i'm
sure
uh
couple
of
hours
three
at
most
well
i
i've
been
researching
that
and
uh
we
can
reverse
all
the
spells
if
um
we
can
just
lay
our
hands
on
on
amy's
spell
book
well
the
other
way
is
to
cut
the
witch's
head
off
oh
she
needs
a
a
sacred
space
aaa
pentagram
um
large
pot
and
keep
her
away
from
the
science
lab
we'll
need
it
to
cast
our
counterspells
mrs
madison
we
need
to
talk
to
you
about
your
daughter
excuse
me
you
alright
um
in
here
your
daughter
is
meddling
with
something
very
dangerous
are
you
aware
of
that
oh
i
think
you
know
only
too
well
this
girl
is
very
sick
now
you
will
shut
up
and
you
will
listen
to
me
your
daughter
has
access
to
some
very
powerful
magics
and
somehow
your
obsession
with
cheerleading
has
made
as
her
mother
you
should
assume
some
responsibility
for
her
actions
you're
afraid
of
her
i
don't
understand
good
lord
she
locked
herself
upstairs
where
my
god
i
believe
we
can
reverse
your
mother's
spell
well
all
of
them
in
fact
we
need
to
find
her
books
there'd
be
specific
volumes
she'd
need
for
this
kind
of
casting
collect
those
dolls
and
uh
any
other
personal
effects
ah
nice
kitty
let's
see
what
you
were
guarding
ah

is
it
we
found

going
to
school

you're
coming
with
us
i'm
gonna
stop
this
i
promise
you
just
hang
on
we
only
have
a
few
minutes
left
right
here
we
go
the
center

dark
centrum
est
obscurus
the
darkness
breathes
tenebrae
respiratis
the
listener
hears
hear
me
unlock
the
gate
let
the
darkness
shine
cover
us
with
holy
fear
show
me
corsheth
and
gilail
the
gate

closed
receive
the
dark
be

was
um
interesting
i
assume
the
uh
all
the
spells
are
reversed
it
was
my
first
casting
so
i
may
have
got
it
wrong
it
wasn't
exactly
her
