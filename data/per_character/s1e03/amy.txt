wants
to
spend
total
quantity
time
together
and
i'm
like
'dad
i
can
go
out

perfectly
safe'
but
he's
got
all
this
guilt
about
leaving
me
with
my
mom
and
he's
being
a
total
pain
every
single
minute
this
saturday
night
he
wants
to
stay
in
and
make
brownies

brownies
were
my
idea

know
that
i'll
miss
the
intellectual
thrill
of
spelling
out
words
with
my
arms

i'm
sorry

forgot
that
you
wanted
to
be
on
the
