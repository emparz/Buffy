willow
pile
willow
willow
hey
wait
up
or
hear
me
what
was
up
last
night
i
tried
your
line
like
a
million
times
talking
to
okay
that's
it
you
have
a
secret
and
that's
not
allowed
'cause
there's
a
rule
i
knew
it
this
is
so
important
when
did
you
meet
does
he
go
here
what's
his
name
have
you
kissed
him
what's
he
like
you
are
a
thing
of
evil
for
not
telling
me
this
right
away
what's
he
look
like
so
you've
been
seeing
a
guy
and
you
don't
know
what
he
looks
like
okay
this
is
a
puzzle
no
wait
i'm
good
at
these
does
it
involve
a
midget
and
a
block
of
ice
on
line
for
what
oh
no
i
have
a
free
sure
he's
a
sweetie
uh
willow
i
think
it's
really
great
that
you
have
this
cool
pen
pal
but
don't
you
think
you're
kinda
rushing
all
into
this
y'know
what
i
mean
will
down
girl
let's
focus
here
okay
what
do
you
actually
know
about
this
guy
like
what
i
just
wanna
make
sure
you're
careful
that's
all
he
could
be
different
than
you
think
short
tall
skinny
fat
not
everything
but
some
stuff
is
i
mean
what
if
you
guys
get
really
really
intense
and
then
you
find
out
that
he
has
a
hairy
back
hey
i'm
just
trying
to
make
sure
that
he's
good
enough
for
you
i
think
it's
great
that
you
met
someone
she
certainly
looks
perky
check
out
the
jealous
man
you're
jealous
willow's
got
a
thang
and
xander's
left
hanging
yeah
but
you
got
used
to
being
the
belle
of
the
ball
okay
slightly
i
mean
just
not
knowing
what
he's
really
like
you
are
i
get
your
point
i
get
your
point
oh
this
guy
could
be
anybody
he
could
be
weird
or
crazy
or
old
or
he
could
be
a
circus
freak
he's
probably
a
circus
freak
willow
ax
murdered
by
a
circus
freak
okay
okay
what
do
we
do
what
are
we
doing
xander
you
get
me
started
we
are
totally
overreacting
whoa
you're
the
late
girl
till
fifth
period
talkin'
to
malcolm
last
night
nothing
i'm
not
but
if
i
was
it'd
be
saying
'this
just
isn't
like
you'
willow
not
like
me
to
have
a
boyfriend
he's
boyfriendly
i
just
want
you
to
be
sure
to
meet
him
face
to
face
in
daylight
in
a
crowded
place
with
some
friends
y'know
before
you
become
all
obsessive
i
thought
you
said
you
overslept
malcolm
was
right
dave
hey
there
dave
anybody
home
i
wanted
to
ask
you
something
if
you
have
a
minute
well
you're
a
computer
geek
genius
and
uh
i
sort
of
have
a
technical
problem
if
i
wanted
to
find
out
something
about
someone
i
if
someone
emailed
me
could
i
trace
the
letter
but
they
write
the
profile
themselves
right
and
so
they
could
say
anything
they
wanted
wow
i
had
knowledge
well
is
there
a
way
to
find
out
exactly
where
a
letter
an
eletter
came
from
i
mean
the
actual
location
of
the
computer
'cause
you
see
willow's
got
this
boyfriend
malcolm
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
what
do
you
mean
dave
are
you
malcolm
dave
what's
going
on
so
do
i
i'm
telling
you
something
is
going
on
it's
not
just
willow
giles
trust
me
follow
dave
what
in
dark
glasses
and
a
trench
coat
please
i
can
work
this
out
myself
whatever
dave
is
into
it's
large
it
said
crd
but
i
couldn't
get
close
enough
to
see
what
it
was
but
it
closed
looked
pretty
functional
from
where
i
stood
i
don't
have
a
clue
what
they
were
doing
something
about
computers
right
i
mean
he
is
offthechart
smart
besides
i
can
just
tell
something's
wrong
my
spider
sense
is
tingling
pop
culture
reference
sorry
breaking
in
then
this
is
the
plan
tonight
it
is
we're
literary
we'll
be
going
now
i
think
we're
done
makes
our
speaking
english
is
good
dave
how're
you
doing
don't
sweat
it
good
i
need
to
talk
to
her
do
you
know
where
she
is
great
thanks
will
willow
will
you
taking
a
shower
i
guess
not
this
is
how
droughts
get
started
he
tried
to
warn
me
tell
me
the
truth
how's
my
hair
i
just
i
don't
understand
what
would
make
dave
do
a
thing
like
that
yeah
sure
looks
like
a
book
and
moloch
is
inside
that
book
way
to
go
okay
so
a
powerful
demon
with
horns
is
walking
around
sunnydale
and
nobody's
noticed
where
was
it
no
he's
not
out
here
he's
in
there
he's
gone
binary
on
us
and
every
computer
connected
to
it
by
a
modem
solid
okay
okay
so
which
file
do
you
think
it
is
willow
that's
probably
it
right
i'll
just
delete
the
whole
thing
so
that's
what
malcolm
looks
like
so
much
for
delete
file
you
mean
besides
convince
a
perfectly
nice
kid
to
try
and
kill
me
i
don't
know
how
about
mess
up
all
the
medical
equipment
in
the
world
access
launch
codes
for
our
nuclear
missiles
i
think
i
pretty
much
capped
it
with
that
nuclear
missile
thing
i
think
the
first
thing
we
do
is
find
willow
she's
probably
talking
to
him
right
now
god
that
creeps
me
out
let's
never
find
out
okay
i'm
gonna
check
the
computer
lab
and
you
guys
call
her
home
willow
dave
he's
dead
well
it
looks
like
suicide
i'd
guess
fritz
or
the
other
zomboids
from
crd
okay
you
and
i
are
gonna
go
to
willow's
house
giles
you
need
to
come
up
with
a
way
to
get
moloch
out
of
the
'net
then
get
ms
calendar
maybe
she
can
help
you
okay
fine
then
you
can
stay
here
and
come
up
with
a
better
plan
c'mon
willow
willow
willow
'no
more
waiting
i
need
you
to
see
me'
see
him
how
where
the
research
place
guessing
that's
our
best
lead
let's
just
hope
giles
can
back
us
up
yeah
not
at
home
it
looks
like
she
was
taken
somewhere
crd
whatever
moloch
wants
willow
for
it's
probably
in
there
here's
a
tip
hurry
back
way
it's
her
i
can't
bust
it
it's
heavy
steel
building's
security
system
is
computerized
ow
guy's
made
of
metal
wait
take
your
best
shot
it'll
be
fun
malcolm
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
you
