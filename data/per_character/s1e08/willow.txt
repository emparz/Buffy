few
more

a
bit
xander

wanna
stay
and
help
me

was
a
joke
i
made
up

you
tomorrow
oh
buffy
i
didn't
even
see
you
oh
i
was
i
was
talking
why
not
well
i
sort
of
met
someone
last
week
after
we
did
the
scanning
project
in
the
library
no
malcolm
no
and
very
nice
well
i
wasn't
sure
there
was
anything
to
tell
but
last
night
oh
we
talked
all
night
it
was
amazing
he's
so
smart
buffy
and
and
he's
romantic
and
we
agree
about
everything
i
don't
know
i
met
him
online
it's
him
he's
so
sweet
what
should
i
write
back
'i'm
thinking
of
you
too'
no
that's
incredibly
stupid
oh
see
i
knew
you'd
react
like
this
buffy
his
name
is
malcolm
black
he's
eighteen
he
lives
in
elmwood
which
is
about
eighty
miles
from
here
and
he
likes
me
why
does
everything
have
to
be
about
looks
well
no
uh
he
doesn't
talk
like
somebody
who
would
have
a
hairy
back
and
anyways
that
stuff
doesn't
matter
when
you
really
care
about
each
other
maybe
i'm
not
his
ideal
either
uh
xander
xander
not
me
i
think
i'm
gonna
call
it
an
early
night
that's
nice
have
a
good
time
i
overslept
yeah
what
you're
having
an
expression
i
don't
understand
why
you
don't
want
me
to
have
this
i
mean
boys
don't
chase
me
around
all
the
time
i
thought
you'd
be
happy
for
me
malcolm
and
i
really
care
about
each
other
big
deal
if
i
blow
off
a
couple
classes
malcolm
said
you
wouldn't
understand
i
know
what
you
mean
i
feel
like
you
know
me
better
than
anyone
do
you
think
we
should
meet
i'm
nervous
that's
what
buffy
doesn't
understand
how
comfortable
you
can
make
me
feel
how
did
you
know
that
i
guess
i
have
to
sign
off
i'll
talk
to
you
later
bye
mom
dad
dad
did
you
forget
your
keys
again
malcolm
i
don't
understand
what
do
you
want
from
me
why
by
lying
to
me
by
pretending
to
be
a
person
pretending
you
loved
me
let
me
leave
don't
say
that
that's
a
joke
you
don't
love
anything
i'm
not
yours
i'm
never
gonna
be
yours
never
malcolm
remember
me
your
girlfriend
well
i
think
it's
time
we
break
up
or
maybe
we
can
still
be
friends
oh
i'm
sorry
guys
i'm
just
thinking
about
malcolm
moloch
whatever
he's
called
the
one
boy
that's
really
liked
me
and
he's
a
demon
robot
what
does
that
say
about
me
i
mean
i
thought
i
was
really
falling
