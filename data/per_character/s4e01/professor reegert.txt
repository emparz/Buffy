the
point
of
this
course
is
not
to
critique
popular
american
culture
it
is
not
to
pick
at
it
or
look
down
upon
it
and
it
is
not
to
watch
videos
for
credit
the
point
is
to
examine
and
there
are
two
people
talking
at
once
and
i
know
that
one
of
them
is
me
and
the
other
is
a
blonde
girl
you
blonde
girl
stand
up
i'm
very
excited
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
that's
worth
interrupting
my
lecture
for
if
your
name
isn't
on
this
sheet
then
you
are
wasting
everyone's
time
are
you
on
the
sheet
do
you
understand
you
are
sucking
energy
from
everyone
in
this
room
they
came
here
to
learn
get
out
leave
thank
you
