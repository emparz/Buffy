like
worldrenowned

the
painful
'nowning'
process
wait
'images
of
pop
culture'
this
is
good
tthey
watch
movies
ttv
shows
even
commercials
heh
isn't
college
cool
well
you
did
sort
of
wait
till
the
last
minute
with
your
course
selection
that's
an
exaggeration
i
just
you
know
think
it's
good
to
be
prepared
don't
want
to
be
caught
unawares
it's
exciting
though
isn't
it
yeah
it's
like
five
miles
away
it's
uncharted
territory
that
makes
sense
yeah
buffy
hey
isn't
this
cool
there's
so
much
going
on
i
got
all
my
courses
except
for
'modern
poetry'
i
had
to
switch
to
'ethnomusicology'
but
that's
cool
westafrican
drumming

think
it's
going
to
change
everything

you
met
your
roommate
yet
me
neither

hope
she's
cool

heard
about
five
different
issues

i'm
angry
about
each
and
every
one
of
them
what'd
you
get
i
didn't
get
'jello
shots'
ii'll
trade
you
for
aa
'take
back
the
night'
oh
i
got
mine
this
morning
the
lines
are
really
long
now
you
should
have
gone
early
i'm
being
annoying
aren't
i
it's
just
in
high
school
knowledge
was
pretty
much
frowned
upon
you
really
had
to
work
to
learn
anything
but
here
the
energy
the
collective
intelligence
it's
like
this
force
this
penetrating
force
and
i
can
just
feel
my
mind
opening
upyou
knowand
letting
this
place
thrust
into
and
spurt
knowledge
into
that
sentence
ended
up
in
a
different
place
than
it
started
out
in
well

never
wanted
to
hurt
giles'
feelings
but
occult
books

have
the
greatest
selection

real
library

like
a
whole
new
world

name
but
there
were
circumstances
then
there's

were
circumstances

probably
been
so
wrapped
up
in
our
own
petty
lives
that
that
we
totally
missed
the
circumstances
we're
bad
