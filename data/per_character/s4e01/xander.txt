the
whole
world
in
front
of
her
and
she
comes
back
to
this
dive
hey
buff
couple
days
ago
well
i
knew
you
guys
were
starting
the
whole
college
adventure
and
i
didn't
want
to
um
you
know
help
you
move
there's
some
purple
mountains
majesty
i'm
gonna
have
to
say
well
'grand
canyon'
well
i
saw
the
movie
'grand
canyon'
on
cable
really
lame
basically
i
got
as
far
as
oxnard
and
the
engine
fell
out
of
my
car
and
that
was
literally
so
i
ended
up
washing
dishes
at
'the
fabulous
ladies
night
club'
for
about
a
month
and
a
half
while
i
tried
to
pay
for
the
repairs
no
one
really
bothered
me
or
even
spoke
to
me
until
one
night
when
one
of
the
male
strippers
called
in
sick
and
no
power
on
this
earth
will
make
me
tell
you
the
rest
of
that
story
suffice
to
say
i
traded
my
car
in
for
one
that
wasn't
entirely
made
of
rust
came
trundling
back
home
to
the
arms
of
my
loving
parents
where
everything
was
exactly
as
it
was
except
i
sleep
in
the
basement
and
i
have
to
pay
rent
how's
college
no
power
on
this
earth
ok
uh
once
more
with
even
less
feeling
and
you're
sitting
here
alone
at
the
bronze
looking
like
you
just
got
diagnosed
with
cancer
of
the
puppy
then
where's
the
gang
avengers
assemble
let's
get
it
going
ok
buff
what's
the
'what'
here
can't
cut
what
slaying
buffy
this
is
all
about
fear
it's
understandable
but
you
can't
let
it
control
you
'fear
leads
to
anger
anger
leads
to
hate
hate
leads
to
anger'
no
wait
hold
on
'fear
leads
to
hate
hate
leads
to
the
dark
side'
hold
on
no
umm
'first
you
get
the
women
then
you
get
the
money
then
you'
okay
can
we
forget
that
the
point
is
you're
buffy
and
now
in
college
you're
betty
louise
buffy
i've
gone
through
some
fairly
dark
times
in
my
life
faced
some
scary
things
among
them
the
kitchen
at
'the
fabulous
ladies
night
club'
let
me
tell
you
something
when
it's
dark
and
i'm
all
alone
and
i'm
scared
or
freaked
out
or
whatever
i
always
think
'what
would
buffy
do'
you're
my
hero
ok
sometimes
when
it's
dark
and
i'm
all
alone
i
think
'what
is
buffy
wearing'
it's
a
deal
let's
put
this
bitch
in
the
ground
what
do
you
say
and
nothing
says
thank
you
like
dollars
in
the
waistband

do
first
i
can't
believe
the
vampires
