this
world
is
older
than
any
of
you
know
contrary
to
popular
mythology
it
did
not
begin
as
a
paradise
for
untold
eons
demons
walked
the
earth
they
made
it
their
home
their
their
hell
but
in
time
they
lost
their
purchase
on
this
reality
the
way
was
made
for
mortal
animals
for
for
man
all
that
remains
of
the
old
ones
are
vestiges
certain
magicks
certain
creatures
the
books
tell
the
last
demon
to
leave
this
reality
fed
off
a
human
mixed
their
blood
he
was
a
human
form
possessed
infected
by
the
demon's
soul
he
bit
another
and
another
and
so
they
walk
the
earth
feeding
killing
some
mixing
their
blood
with
others
to
make
more
of
their
kind
waiting
for
the
animals
to
die
out
and
the
old
ones
to
return
for
as
long
as
there
have
been
vampires
there's
been
the
slayer
one
girl
in
all
the
world
a
chosen
one
alright
the
slayer
hunts
vampires
buffy
is
a
slayer
don't
tell
anyone
well
i
think
that's
all
the
vampire
information
you
need
and
they'd
believe
us
of
course
you
have
no
idea
where
they
took
jesse
let's
take
an
enormous
intuitive
leap
shall
we
and
say
they
went
underground
if
we
had
a
diagnostic
of
the
tunnel
system
it
might
indicate
a
a
meeting
place
it
would
uh
i
suppose
we
could
go
to
the
building
commission
so
all
the
city
plans
are
just
uh
open
to
the
public
i
think
you're
being
a
bit
hard
on
yourself
well
then
help
me
i've
been
researching
this
harvest
affair
it
seems
to
be
some
sort
of
preordained
massacre
rivers
of
blood
hell
on
earth
quite
charmless
i'm
a
bit
fuzzy
however
on
the
details
it
may
be
that
you
can
wrest
some
information
from
that
dread
machine
that
was
a
bit
um
british
wasn't
it
i
want
you
to
go
on
the
'net
do
i
have
to
tell
you
to
be
careful
'for
they
will
gather
and
be
gathered
from
the
vessel
pours
life'
p
pours
life
'on
the
night
of
the
crescent
moon
the
first
past
the
solstice
it
will
come'
of
course
that's
tonight
buffy
ah
not
as
yet
no
did
you
find
anything
of
interest
great
ii
mean
well
not
not
'great'
in
a
good
way
uh
um
uh
go
on
it's
all
coming
together
i
rather
wish
it
weren't
how
about
the
end
of
the
world
this
is
what
we
know
some
sixty
years
ago
a
very
old
very
powerful
vampire
came
to
this
shore
not
just
to
feed
yes
the
spanish
who
first
settled
here
called
it
'boca
del
inferno'
roughly
translated
'hellmouth'
it's
a
sort
of
um
portal
between
this
reality
and
the
next
this
vampire
hopes
to
open
it
you
see
opening
dimensional
portals
is
a
tricky
business
odds
are
he
got
himself
stuck
rather
like
a
uh
cork
in
a
bottle
it
comes
once
in
a
century
on
this
night
the
master
can
draw
power
from
one
of
his
minions
while
it
feeds
enough
power
to
break
free
and
open
the
portal
the
minion
is
called
the
vessel
and
he
bears
this
symbol
simply
put
yes
there
there
are
a
number
of
possibilities
then
we
should
get
there
the
sun
will
be
down
before
long
what
for
we're
too
late
right
come
on
uh
see
you
inside
then
you
listen
to
me
jesse
is
dead
you
have
to
remember
that
when
you
see
him
you're
not
looking
at
your
friend
you're
looking
at
the
thing
that
killed
him
hurry
hurry
up
come
on
through
this
door
come
on
this
way
one
at
a
time
quickly
quickly
we're
going
to
have
to
open
the
front
as
well
i
take
it
it's
over
people
have
a
tendency
to
rationalize
what
they
can
and
forget
what
they
can't
good
next
time
you'll
be
prepared
we've
prevented
the
master
from
freeing
himself
and
opening
the
mouth
of
hell
that's
not
to
say
he's
going
to
stop
trying
i'd
say
the
fun
is
just
beginning
not
just
vampires
the
next
threat
we
face
may
be
something
quite
different
we're
at
the
center
of
a
mystical
convergence
here
we
may
in
fact
stand
between
the
earth
and
its
total
destruction
the
earth
is
doomed
