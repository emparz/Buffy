hey
where's
jesse
which
way
jesse
and
vampires
no
no
ththose
weren't
vampires
those
were
just
guys
in
thundering
need
of
a
facial
or
maybe
they
had
rabies
it
could
have
been
rabies
aand
that
guy
turning
to
dust
just
a
trick
of
light
that's
exactly
what
i
said
the
first
time
i
saw
a
vampire
well
after
i
was
done
with
the
screaming
part
you
are
sitting
down
he
loves
doing
this
part
you
don't
i
do
jesse
is
my
responsibility
i
let
him
get
taken
breathe
breathe
this
big
guy
luke
he
talked
about
an
offering
to
the
master
now
i
don't
know
what
or
who
but
if
they
weren't
just
feeding
then
jesse
may
still
be
alive
i'm
gonna
find
him
they
couldn't
handle
it
even
of
they
did
show
up
they'd
only
come
with
guns
i
looked
around
but
soon's
they
got
clear
of
the
graveyard
they
could
have
just
voom
they
can
drive
vampires
really
jam
on
sewer
systems
you
can
get
anywhere
in
the
entire
town
without
catching
any
rays
but
i
didn't
see
any
access
around
there
we
so
don't
have
time
there
it
is
there's
nothing
here
this
is
useless
you're
the
one
that
told
me
that
i
wasn't
prepared
enough
understatement
i
thought
i
was
on
top
of
everything
and
then
that
monster
luke
came
out
of
nowhere
he
didn't
come
out
of
nowhere
he
came
from
behind
me
i
was
facing
the
entrance
he
came
from
behind
me
and
he
didn't
follow
me
out
the
access
to
the
tunnels
is
in
the
mausoleum
the
girl
must
have
doubled
back
with
jesse
after
i
got
out

so
mentally
challenged

no
'we'
