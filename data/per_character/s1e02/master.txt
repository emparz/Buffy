is
this
for
me
you've
tasted
it
i'm
your
faithful
dog
you
bring
me
scraps
i
have
waited
for
three
score
years
i
have
waited
while
you
come
and
go
i
am
stuck
here
here
in
this
house
of
worship
my
ascension
is
almost
at
hand
pray
that
when
it
comes
i'm
in
a
better
mood
a
slayer
a
slayer
have
you
any
proof
hmm
very
nearly
proof
enough
i
can't
remember
the
last
time
that
happened
she
mustn't
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
the
harvest
don't
worry
about
it
i
believe
she'll
come
to
us
we
have
something
she
wants
if
she
is
a
slayer
and
this
boy
lives
she'll
try
to
save
him
she
escaped
she
walks
free
when
i
should
be
drinking
her
heart's
blood
right
now
careless
oh
are
you
going
to
make
excuses
you
are
all
weak
it
has
been
too
long
since
you
have
faced
the
slayer
huh
it
is
no
matter
to
me
she
will
not
stop
the
harvest
just
means
there'll
be
someone
worth
killing
when
i
reach
the
surface
is
luke
ready
it's
time
bring
him
to
me

failed
me

something
in
your
eye

blood
is
your
blood

soul

your
soul
on
this
most
hallowed
night
we
are
as
one
luke
is
the
vessel
every
soul
he
takes
will
feed
me
and
their
souls
will
grant
me
the
strength
to
free
myself
tonight
i
shall
walk
the
earth
and
the
stars
themselves
will
hide
almost
free
give
me
