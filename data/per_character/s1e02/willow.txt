no
get
off
xander
xander
are
you
okay
i
don't
know
they
surrounded
us
isn't
that
what
we
saw
last
night
oh
i
i
need
to
sit
down
oh
good
for
me
if
you
hadn't
shown
up
they
would
have
taken
us
too
does
anybody
mind
if
i
pass
out
breathe
uh
this
may
be
the
dumb
question
but
shouldn't
we
call
the
police
well
we
don't
have
to
say
vampires
we
we
could
just
say
that
there's
a
a
bad
man
i
don't
remember
hearing
a
car
uh
guys
there
may
be
another
way
that
runs
under
the
graveyard
um
well
iin
a
way
i
sort
of
stumbled
onto
them
when
i
accidentally
decrypted
the
city
council's
security
system
buffy
i'm
not
anxious
to
go
into
a
dark
place
full
of
monsters
but
i
do
want
to
help
i
need
to
oh
sure
i
can
do
that
murder
death
disaster
what
else
earthquake
flood
right
i'll
put
it
on
the
computer
search
if
it's
in
there
it'll
turn
up
anything
that'll
lead
us
to
vampires
not
like
an
idiot
just
standing
buffy
doesn't
want
you
getting
hurt
i
don't
want
you
getting
hurt
i
know
and
everyone
else
thinks
it's
just
a
normal
day
we
do
that's
what
a
secret
is
when
you
know
something
other
guys
don't
you
mean
'we'
we
should
get
to
class
buffy'll
be
okay
whatever's
down
there
i
think
she
can
handle
it
so
do
i
no
she's
not
she's
not
a
psycho
you
don't
even
know
her
deliver
it's
just
me
so
there's
no
word
well
ii'm
sure
they're
great
i
think
maybe
i
surfed
through
the
old
newspapers
around
the
time
of
that
big
earthquake
back
in
'37
and
for
several
months
before
there
were
a
rash
of
murders
well
they
sound
like
the
kind
you
were
looking
for
throats
blood
did
you
find
jesse
was
he
dead
at
least
you
two
are
okay
but
he
blew
it
or
i
mean
there
was
an
earthquake
that
swallowed
half
the
town
and
him
too
are
you
sure
no
joy
get
off
of
him
did
we
win
well
i'll
never
forget
it
none
of
it
next
time
is
why
more
vampires
maybe
you
could
blow
something
up
they're
really
strict
about
that
