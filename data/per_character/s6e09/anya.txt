it's
such
a
pain
the
text
i
wanted
giles
took
it
with
him
he
has
this
thing
that

owning
a
book
makes
it
like
his
property
maybe
it's
cursed
diamonds
are
excellent
for
cursing
that's
a
dd
manual
sweetie
let's
face
it
we're
not
gonna
find
this
thing
because
it
doesn't
exist
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
frost
monster
who
eats
diamonds
great
someone
to
do
more
magic
with
well
those
are
the
ones
you
have
to
watch
out
for
the
most
responsible
types
i'm
serious
responsible
people
are

always
so
concerned
with

being
good
all
the
time
that
when
they
finally
get
a
taste
of
being
bad

they
can't
get
enough
it's
like
all
kablooey
okay
not
kablooey
more
like
bam
yeah
she
was
getting
out
of
control
with
it
before
tara
left
and
now
that
she's
gone
yeah
even
the
ones
that
weren't
so
boring
you
wanted
to
kill
yourself
optimism
i
remember
optimism
