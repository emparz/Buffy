amy
and
willow
grin
happily
look
at
the
dancing
boys
every
time
i
see
you
i
can't
find
the
words
to

amy
looks
down
at
the
lower
level
makes
a
gesture
a
whiteclad
demo
appears
floating
over
the
dancers'
heads
i
just
wanna
turn
and
run
away
willow
makes
a
gesture
at
two
guys
standing
sidebyside
one
guy
begins
to
shrink
while
the
other
grows
very
large
both
looking
around
and
yelling
in
confusion
i
can't
find
the
time
and
place
to
say
what
i
need
to
say
