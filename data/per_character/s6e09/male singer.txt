low
country
wars
oh
there's
a
demon
she's
drinkin'
and
thinkin'
of
runnin'
away
close
shot
of
willow's
face
as
she
bends
over
sound
of
billiard
balls
clinking
willow
grimaces
i'm
getting
caught
in
the
corners
of
her
vermilion
borders
she's
moving
backwards
and
forwards
and
she's
ugly
when
she's
insecure
cut
to
later
willow
sits
by
herself
staring
at
a
martini
glass
she
lifts
out
the
plastic
stirrer
with
an
olive
speared
on
it
what
is
wrong
here
what
is
wrong
here
what
is
wrong
with
you
