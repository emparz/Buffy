get
the
hell
outta

um
we're
with
a
tour
group
the
getthefreezeray
tour
group
musta
gotten
separated
really
huh
guess
we
just
lost
track
of
time
we
should
probably
get
the
freeze
ray
out
of
here
now
'cause
we
love
the
learning
rusty
museums
libraries
disney
hall
of
presidents

not
boring
but
more
to
the
point
goodbye

so
cool
so
there's
a
kink
or
two
it's
just
a
prototype
i
mean
soon
we'll
have
jonathan

really
neato

stuff
but
in
the
meantime
you
know

ow
be
a
bigger
wuss
yeah
yeah
come
on
and
say
what
'two
guys
and
a
mime
took
me
out
with
their
freeze
ray'
that's
likely
come
on
yes
gentlemen
it
turns
out
size
is
everything
no
offense
man
all
right
i
think
we've
finished
the
first
part
now
it's
time
for
phase
two
is
the
van
fired
up
we're
kind
of
in
the
middle
of
something
yeah
what
are
you
gonna
do
if
we
don't
especially
feel
like
maybe
playing
your
spike
turns
around
sees
a
display
of
action
figures
reaches
for
it
what
are
wait
what
are
you
doing
all
right
dude

chill
you
can
still
make
it
right
you
know
you
don't
wanna
do
this
right
but
you
don't
wanna
hurt
the
fett
'cause
man
you're
not
comin'
back
from
that
you
know
you
don't
just
do
that
and
walk
away
wah
uh
one
second
i'm
gonna
help
him
out
see
we
help
him
and
he
owes
us
one
see
we
get
spike
on
our
side
we
get
info
on
buffy
and
maybe
maybe
we
can
even
find
a
way
to
keep
her
out
of
phase
two
'course
not
but
alliances
aren't
about
trust
see
he
needs
us
we
need
him
well
that's
how
these
things
work
i
think
we're
ready
agreed
i
think
we
can
work
something
out
i'll
take
a
look
at
your
chip
it'll
be
a
deal
we
scratch
your
back
you
scratch
spike
i'm
not
scratching
your
anything
you
do
what
i
tell
you
that's
the
deal
deal
deal
here
i
am
here
okay
right
um

your
chip
works
fine
yeah
but
whatever
it
is
it
works
fine
there's
no
deterioration
of
the
signal
it
still
is
coming
through
on
a
steady
pulse
which
it's
supposed
to
no
i
promise
who
would
i
tell
i
don't
even
know
what
this
is
about
