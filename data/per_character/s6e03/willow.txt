she's
at
home
she
has
to
be
we're
we
just
need
to
get
there
and
she'll
be
there
i
wish
we
were
there
already
iit
was
buffy
right
we
we
saw
her
and
it
was
really
buffy
no
she's
not
broken
she's
just

disoriented
from
being

tormented
in
some
hell
dimension
probably
tortured
and

it's
like
we
don't
even
know
how
much
time
has
passed
there
for
her
uh
possibly
years
that's
not
something
you
just
get
over
oh
my
god
what
if
she
never
gets
over
it
is
she
here
you're
here
buffy
are
you
in
pain
a
spell
we
we
did
a
spell
right
uh
dawn's
right
we
should
just
be
quiet
and
let
buffy
tell
us
what
she
needs
right
long
day
but
buffy

be
happy
we
got
you
out
we
really
did
it
well
she
she's
fine
normal
she
used
to
go
to
bed
all
the
time
hey
yeah
he's
gonna
head
back
as
soon
as
he
can
i'm
not
sure
like
maybe
a
couple
days
um

i'm
not
sure
i
mean

glad
but

kinda
weirded
out
which
i
get
you
know
lots
of
dear
lords
and
i
think
i
actually
heard
him
cleaning
his
glasses
worried
tara
it
worked
fine
it's
all
good
well

i'm
not

unworried
i
mean
what
what
happened
that
was
intense
that's

gotta
change
you
when
angel
came
back

buffy
said

he
was
wild
like
an
animal
yeah
it's
just
kinda

noisy
up
here
tonight
you
know
yeah
i
think
it
makes
things
quieter
in
here
huh
yeah
tara
if
things
did
go
right

wouldn't
you
think
she'd
be

happier
like
wouldn't
you
think
she
would
be
so
happy
that
we
brought
her
out
would
i
be
a
terrible
person
if
i
said
yes
right
no
need
to
be
in
a
big
furry
hurry
buffy
okay
what
in
the
frilly
heck
is
going
on
right
right
wrong
different
brains
well
i
understood
the
words
but

no
hat
was
that
what
is
it
after
is
it

buffy
that's
it
i'm
gonna
call
i
hope
xander's
up
xander
it's
me
willow
we
were
just
attacked
no
it
was
buffy
or
something
that
looked
like
her
and
then
she
just
disappeared
aand
and
we
saw
something
a
little

there's
something
in
the
house
xander
xander
well
whatever
it
is
it's
not
the
the
traditional
haunting
because
iit's
not
limited
to
one
specific
place
and
there's
not
you
know
a
dead
person
you
mean
like
some
hellbeastie
rode
in
with
buffy
like

we're
responsible
for
this
it's
okay
we
we
just
kill
the
beastie
and
then
all
is
good
we're
rolling
in
puppies

right
buffy
you're
not
supposed
to
be
up
it's
not
like
she's
making
it
sound
a
little
hauntingtype
stuff
booscary
everything's
normal
you
are
and
buffy
we're
we're
so
glad
yes
that's
just
what
we
have
so
far
five
species
of
demons
that
have
been
known
to
move
transdimensionally
two
of
them
may
be
invisible
in
this
dimension
and
uh
two
others
can
perform
spells
to
alter
perception
i'm
not
sure
maybe

maybe
some
of
us
can
uh
keep
going
finding
more
and
the
others
buffy
i
miss
giles
oh
he's
coming
back
i
talked
to
him
i
know
i'm
a
kind
of
poor
substitute
but
until
then
we'll
get
it
done
well
i
know
we'll
find
something
soon
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
that
was
it
lilike
buffy
with
fire
no
i'm
sure
you
looked
really
glamorous
cutting
up
your
face
you'll
be
okay
thaumogenesis
i'm
not
possessed
ii
think
i
figured
it
out
this
demon
iit's
not
a
demon
we
let
out
it's
it's
a
demon
that
we
made
thaumogenesis
is
when
doing
a
spell
actually
creates
a
being
in
this
case
it
was
like
a
a
sideeffect
i
guess
like
a
price
think
of
it
like
the
world
doesn't
like
you
getting
something
for
free
and
we
asked
for
this
huge
gift
buffy
aand
so
the
world
said
'fine
but
if
you
have
that
you
have
to
take
this
too'
and
it
made
the
demon
well
i
i
think
it's
out
of
phase
with
this
dimension
like
its
consciousness
is
here
but
but
its
body
is
caught
in
the
ether
between
existing
and
not
existing
or
or
it's
manifesting
copies
of
them
like
like
it
did
when
buffy
came
at
us
uhhuh
except
that

it's
linked
to
the
spell
so
if
we
sent
it
away

it
would
be
like
the
spell
doesn't
exist
like
it
never
happened
yes
dawn
we're
not
going
to
do
it
that
way
wait
wait
dawn
everybody
hold
on
because
it's
temporary
the
demon
iit's
gonna
dissipate
the
only
way
for
it
to
survive
on
this
plane
is
if
it
were
to
kill
the
subject
of
the
original
spell
that's
not
gonna
xander
lifts
his
head
and
we
see
that
his
eyes
are
white
solid
buffy
hey
you're
welcome
