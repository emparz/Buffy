this
is
this
is
terrible
i'll
never
be
able
to
mend
this
oh
yes
inappropriate
humor
most
amusing
don't
suppose
you
know
what
led
to
this
sartorial
tragedy
yes
of
course
i
just
thought
maybe
after
her
magnificent
incandescence
was
returned
to
this

manly
and

painfully
handsome
assemblage

you
might
have
noticed
something
interesting
a
key
in
human
form
perhaps
lounging
about
unattended
why
do
you
insist
on
fighting
the
inevitable
no
one
can
stand
against
her
blindingly
scrumptious
luminescence
with
all
due
respect
andand
fear
of
sharp
objects
you
exist
sir
only
because
of
her
divine
greatness
we
play
the
hand
we're
dealt
flattering
drawstring
pants
drugs
sir
impossible
her
magnificence
can
never
be
fully
contained
she
is
a
perfect
allencompassing
light
one
you
should
feel
honored
to
be
bathed
in
true
this
ohsoappealing
form
will
of
necessity
be
shrugged
off
and
if
you
did

what
then
could
you
do
it
take
a
human
life
with
your
own
hands
oblivion
is
such
a
small
inconvenience
in
the
service
of
a
deity
accept
your
fate
i
mean
you
said
it
yourself
this
life
was
never
really
yours
anyway
was
it
it's
coming
the
signs
are
in
alignment
and
soon
victory
will
be
in
our
grasp
all
we
need
do
is
seize
the
moment

and
squeeze
until
it
bleeds
