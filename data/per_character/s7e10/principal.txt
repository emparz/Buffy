buffy
hey
i—thought
that
you
were
um—
yeah
i
remember
so
please
don't
go
on
oh
yeah
um
apparently
somebody
left
this
in
the
courtyard
and
i
was
just
returning
it
i
try
buffy
you
know
if
you
are
feeling
better
i
could
really
use
you
back
at
work
i've
been
wait
listing
kids
who
really
want
to
see
you
no
no
it's
fine
and
i
understand
it's
just
things
are
starting
to
back
up
good
manifestations
of
evil
in
the
movies
you're
searching
for
evil
movies
hmm
as
opposed
to
rob
schneider's
oeuvre
yeah
buffy
you
know
i'm
not
that
big
a
fan
of
scary
movies
even
the
hokie
ones
sometimes
they
go
to
a
place
that
i
think
kids
could
stand
to
avoid
yeah
yeah
i'm
only
saying
that
once
you
see
true
evil
it
can
have
some
serious
after
burn
and
then
you
can't
unsee
what
you
saw
ever
that's
just
one
opinion
i
better
get
back
to
work
oh
me
mysteries
i
love
finding
out
what's
underneath
it
all
at
the
very
end
