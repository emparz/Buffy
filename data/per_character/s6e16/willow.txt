if
i
ask
anya
i
can
still
go
with
the
traditional

blood
larva
and
burlap
i
mean
she
was
a
a
vengeance
demon
for
like
a
thousand
years
she
would
know
all
the
most
flattering

larvae
what
was
she
thinking
oh
my
god
last
night
that
rehearsal
dinner
that
was
like
a
a
zoo
without
the
table
manners
and
i
bet
it
got
worse
after
we
left
and
xander's
family
i
haven't
seen
them
that
bad
since
my
bat
mitzvah

you
see
how
much
they
drank
want
me
to
hold
it
shut
for
you
wow
you
look
lovely
really
lovely
you
can't
it's
bad
luck
for
the
groom
to
see
the
bride
in
her
dress
remember
i'll
say
this
for
the
y
chromosome

looks
good
in
a
tux

little
xander

a
good
thing
i
realized
i
was
gay

formal
wear
do
you
know
how
much
i
love
you
you
ready
for
the
long
walk

your
time

gonna
find
him
aand
you're
going
to
stall

anyone
else
waiting
for
it
to
go
poof
maybe
we
can
cover
it
with
flowers
she
wants
to
be
alone
that's
what
she
wants
oh
god
it
just
hurts
my
heart
to
think
of
her
i
don't

i
feel
like
i
should
be
hating
xander
but
i
can't
i
just

i
just
hope
he's
okay
