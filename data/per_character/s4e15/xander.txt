so
here
it
is
the
latest
in
stateoftheart
combat
technology
i
gotta
say
it
doesn't
look
that
complicated
the
camera
pulls
back
and
we're
in
xander's
basement
he
has
the
weapon
on
the
counter
willow
is
standing
next
to
him
with
tools
in
her
hands
should
he
need
them
buffy
is
standing
behind
them
behind
her
giles
is
seated
on
the
couch
folding
a
basket
of
laundry
on
the
coffee
table
sure
as
soon
as
i
get
my
master's
degree
in
advanced
starship
technology
second
it's
called
a
blaster
will
a
word
that
tends
to
discourage
experimentation
now
if
it
were
called
the
orgasmator
i'd
be
the
first
to
try
your
basic
button
press
approach
but
if
i
blow
a
hole
in
my
mom's
azalea
patch
the
neighbors
will
not
be
pleased
so
not
a
problem
and
i
can
go
a
long
healthy
stretch
without
seeing
anything
like
that
again
i
really
don't
want
to
be
around
for
the
final
exam
question

will
hiding
in
a
cavern
with
stockpiled
chocolate
goods
be
any
part
of
this
plan
told
you
you
want
stealth
stuff
that'sgreatriley
and
y'knowthere's
no
polite
way
to
ask
you
this
butuhdid
they
put
a
chip
in
your
brain
based
on
the
clues
i'll
go
with
killing
spree
hey
how'd
you
do
that
is
there
like
an
onoff
button
somewhere
here
riley's
right
it
is
the
least
we
can
do
i'd
say
this
qualifies
for
a
worst
timing
ever
award
i'd
hate
to
see
the
pursuit
of
a
homicidal
lunatic
get
in
the
way
of
pursuing
a
homicidal
lunatic
good
plan
been
there
tried
that
not
unlike
smothering
a
forest
fire
with
napalm
as
i
recall
one
word
evil
who
she's
doing
the
point
being
i
could
be
the
target
here
faith
finds
mr
xander
harris
still
in
town
she
goes
tighter
than
cat
gut
got
a
lotta
pentup
feelings
there
i'm
only
saying
see
i
can't
be
held
responsible
for
the
effect
i
have
on
women
see
faith
and
i
have
this
little
thing
between
us
called
history
spike
for
your
information
smarty
we've
got
a
rogue
slayer
on
our
hands
real
psychokiller
too
her
dark
hair
yay
tall
name
of
faith
criminally
insane
in
a
bad
way
yeah
go
ahead
you
wouldn't
even
recognise
her
we're
dumb
