stand
down
soldier
stand
down
before
i
put
you
down
man
was
in
my
way
i
got
places
to
be
you
know
where
i'm
going
you
wouldn't
understand
i
don't
explain
because
i
don't
have
to
i'm
the
one
in
charge
do
they
family
is
that
what
we
are
step
aside
am
i
really
worth
all
that
no
a
giant
skewer
through
the
rib
cage
hurt
me
that
was
just
a
reminder
i
walked
oh
they
did
repeatedly
but
then
i
told
them
they
couldn't
keep
me
without
a
major
asskicking
one
way
or
another
so
here
i
am
beg
your
pardon
me
too
hey
i
know
my
behaviour
was
pretty
out
there
taking
down
adam's
gonna
be
tough
there's
no
way
to
predict
what
he'll
throw
at
us
me
neither
all
i
had
in
there
was
this
one
little
part
of
you
sure
it
is
just
knowing
you
were
out
therethat
you
caredi
think
we're
being
watched
maybe
give
me
an
order
that's
what
i
do
isn't
it
follow
orders
don't
i
all
my
life
that's
what
i've
been
groomed
to
do
they
say
jump
i
ask
how
high
i
get
the
job
done
just
don't
know
if
it's
the
right
job
anymore
ever
obey
them
now
see
that's
where
you
and
i
are
different
i
just
suck
at
the
whole
gray
area
thing
you
make
it
sound
so
simple
i
don't
even
know
what
my
way
is
i'm
a
soldier
i
got
a
way
which
one
of
them
what're
you
doing
hehfinding
any
sure
about
that
he's
probably
working
off
an
autonomic
power
source
and
because
he's
straight
out
of
the
box
he
needs
to
charge
up
a
while
and
that's
a
best
case
scenario
i
suppose
a
little
firepower
would
be
a
good
idea
right
now
blasters
are
easy
adam
won't
be
speak
for
yourself
i'm
just
saying
i'm
not
exactly
sure
what
you'd
call
me
but
i
will
share
information
it's
the
least
i
can
do
who's
faith
okay
i
get
it
faith
bad
do
i
look
like
i'm
arguing
figured
it
out
huh
damn
it
took
my
mom
twelve
years
to
catch
that
one
all
i'm
saying
is
if
you're
in
trouble
i
wanna
help
give
me
one
reason
why
alright
i'm
not
exactly
action
guy
but
there's
gotta
be
something
i
can
do
other
than
sit
around
waiting
for
you
to
pummel
this
gal
never
seen
anyone
get
under
your
skin
this
way
before
what
exactly
did
she
do
to
you
i'm
from
iowa

drive
four
hours
for
our
high
school
football
game

something

not
telling
me

just
saying

think
you're
holding
out
on
me
