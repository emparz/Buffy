nonsense
it's
a
beautiful
day
now
eat
your
sandwich
you're
too
young
and
too
pretty
a
girl
to
start
wearing
worry
lines
on
your
face
well
hey
hey
hey
hello
faith
if
you're
watching
this
tape
it
can
only
mean
one
thing
i'm
dead
and
our
noble
campaign
to
bring
order
to
the
town
of
sunnydale
has
failed
utterly
and
completely
but
on
the
other
hand
heck
maybe
we
won
and
right
now
i'm
on
some
jumbo
monitor
in
the
richard
wilkins
surrounded
by
a
bunch
of
kids
sitting
indian
style
and
looking
up
at
my
face
filled
with
fear
and
wonder
hi
kids
but
the
realist
in
me
tends
to
doubt
it
now
faith
as
i
record
this
message
you're
sleeping
and
the
doctors
tell
me
you
might
never
wake
up
i
don't
believe
that
sooner
or
later
you
will
wake
up
and
when
you
do
you'll
find
the
world
has
gone
and
changed
on
you
i
wish
i
could
make
the
world
a
better
place
for
you
to
wake
up
in
but
tough
as
it
is
to
accept
we
both
have
to
understand
that
even
my
power
to
protect
and
watch
over
you
has
its
limits
see
the
hard
pill
to
swallow
is
that
once
i'm
gone
your
days
are
just
plain
numbered
now
i
know
you're
a
smart
and
capable
young
woman
in
charge
of
her
own
life
but
the
problem
faith
is
that
there
won't
be
a
place
in
the
world
for
you
anymore
by
now
i
bet
you're
feeling
very
much
alone
but
you're
never
alone
you'll
always
have
me
and
you'll
always
have
this
go
ahead
open
the
box
don't
worry
it's
not
gonna
bite
that's
my
job
go
ahead
open
it
surprise
you
won't
find
these
in
any
gumball
machine
see
when
you've
been
around
as
long
as
i
have
you
amke
friends
and
some
of
them
forge
neat
little
gizmos
just
like
the
one
you're
holding
right
now
and
here's
the
good
news
just
because
it's
over
for
my
faith
doesn't
mean
she
can't
go
out
with
a
bang
