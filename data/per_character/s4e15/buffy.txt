they
smell
good
don't
they
the
camera
pulls
back
and
we
see
faith
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
matching
buffy's
movements
clean
sheets
like
summer
right
i
forgot
ii
wish
i
could
stay
but
it's
just
with
now
i
really
have
to
so
can
you
repair
it
just
tell
me
can
you
repair
it
or
not
what
some
rest
there's
a
demonoid
killing
machine
out
there
giles
it
doesn't
only
work
the
night
shift
just
get
the
blaster
working
that's
all
the
strength
i
need
why
because
ray
guns
aren't
in
the
slayer
handbook
well
you
haven't
seen
this
adam
thing
he's
the
terminator
without
the
bashful
charm
he's
deadly
and
the
last
time
we
met
he
kicked
my
ass
they
keep
telling
me
that
he's
fine
that's
all
they'll
say
maybe
i
don't
even
know
what
the
initiative's
version
of
fine
is
they
could
be
forcing
him
back
onto
medication
and
torturing
him
for
all
i
know
the
only
thing
i
know
for
certain
is
that
my
boyfriend
is
locked
away
and
i'm
not
helping
all
i
know
is
that
the
initiative
has
all
those
brainwashy
behaviour
modification
guys
so
what
happens
when
they
start
not
liking
his
behaviour
i
told
you
i
had
things
to
do
not
too
far
i've
never
seen
anything
like
that
he's
studying
biology
human
demon
whoever
he
can
get
his
hands
on
and
take
apart
it's
not
coming
to
that
the
initiative
created
this
thing
and
they
can't
stop
it
but
we
will
no
riley
i'm
not
leaving
him
down
there
with
the
people
that
created
this
thing
i
don't
care
how
many
guns
they
have
i'm
going
in
okay
will
i
need
you
to
hack
into
their
security
mainframe
and
buy
me
a
ten
minute
shut
down
of
operation
systems
tricky
not
impossible
if
you
can't
do
it
online
then
use
magic
xander
any
gear
you've
been
saving
for
a
rainy
day
i
want
you
to
give
to
me
no
we
tried
sneaking
in
this
time
we're
gonna
use
force
i
figure
i'll
go
in
through
the
elevator
shaft
use
the
cable
as
towlines
then
blast
open
the
facility
doors
and
find
the
infirmary
riley
oh
god
i'm
sorry
did
i
hurt
you
how
did
you
get
out
forget
it
we're
just
happy
to
have
you
back
you're
here
whatever
comes
we
can
handle
it's
just
the
scarf
part
of
me
really
i
dunno
does
the
initiative
do
that
you
seem
a
littlesomewhere
else
is
there
anything
i
can
do
you
don't
have
to
i
know
how
you
feel
giles
used
to
be
part
of
this
council
and
for
years
all
they
ever
did
was
give
me
orders
sure
the
ones
i
was
going
to
do
anyway
the
point
is
i
quit
the
council
and
i
was
scared
but
it's
okay
now
it's
a
choice
go
back
in
there
and
make
some
changes
from
the
inside
or
you
can
quit
the
team
fight
demons
in
your
own
way
well
it's
time
to
find
out
good
man
i
am
looking
for
brain
washy
chips
in
your
head
not
sure
but
i
should
probably
keep
looking
just
in
case
you've
been
strong
long
enough
riley
finn
i'm
here
for
you
and
we're
gonna
find
this
demon
and
we're
gonna
kill
it
together
and
in
the
meantime
you
are
gonna
stop
torturing
yourself
it's
an
order
okay
what's
he
charging
up
for
well
if
she
did
they're
gonna
be
in
the
initiative
a
really
good
idea
are
you
sure
you
wanna
be
double
agent
guy
hello
what
sort
of
emergency
no
i
haven't
thank
you
i'll
let
you
know
it's
faith
she's
awake
she
beat
someone
up
took
her
clothing
and
disappeared
out
of
the
hospital
no
one
knows
where
she
is
well
faith's
not
exactly
lowprofile
girl
i'll
patrol
and
wait
for
her
to
make
a
move
good
on
paper
but
we
still
have
a
decision
to
make
do
we
hand
her
over
to
the
cops
they
wouldn't
know
what
to
do
with
a
slayer
even
if
they
knew
we
existed
there's
no
way
around
it
faith
is
back
and
whether
i
like
it
or
not
she's
my
responsibility
we
have
no
idea
where
she
is
we
don't
know
what
she's
thinking
what
she's
feeling
she
could
be
terrified
maybe
she
doesn't
even
remember
or
maybe
she
does
and
she's
sorry
and
she's
alone
hiding
somewhere
i'm
not
going
to
rule
it
out
first
thing
we
need
to
find
her
then
we
can
take
it
from
there
the
truth
that
she's
my
wacky
identical
cousin
from
england
and
whenever
she
visits
hijinks
ensue
no
i
told
him
the
story
i
vagued
up
a
few
bits
but
no
flatout
lies
i
did
some
editing
it's
not
that
i'm
trying
to
hide
anything
from
riley
it's
just
that's
a
longer
conversation
and
i
had
a
faithhunt
to
do
couldn't
find
her
don't
know
exactly
where
to
place
that
little
upcontinuum
pressure's
definitely
on
i'm
telling
you
if
i
were
her
i'd
get
outta
dodge
post
hasty
i've
been
looking
for
you

you
alright
so
much
for
pleasantries
huh
it
doesn't
have
to
be
like
this
y'know
faith
these
are
innocent
people
i
guess
it
was
too
much
to
hope
that
you'd
use
your
downtime
to
reflect
and
grow
you
had
it
coming
to
me
mostly
that
you
still
mouth
off
about
things
you
don't
understand
uhoh
i
guess
somebody
knows
you're
here
not
yet
but
you
always
make
that
innocent
face
right
before
you
start
you
can't
that's
one
riley
the
fact
that
you
just
called
faith
a
gal
only
proves
that
you
don't
know
her
it's
a
long
story
i
told
you
okay
she
hurt
me
and
people
i
care
about
and
did
i
mention
the
psycho
killer
part

isn't
a
joke

a
criminally
insane
woman
out
there
with
superpowers
who
thinks
i'm
responsible
for
ruining
her
life

know
faith
she'll
come
after
me
and
she'll
come
after
the
people
i
love
