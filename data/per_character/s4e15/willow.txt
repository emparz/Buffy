by
all
means

only
meantno
word
about

they're
telling
the
truth
maybe
giles
has
a
point
i
mean
riley
is
their
top
gun
guy
doesn't
make
sense
that
they'd
hurt
him
so
spread
out
it
had
to
be
adam
who
killed
it
but
why
he's
finding
out
what
makes
things
work
what's
first
that
could
be
they
didn't
try
to
stop
you
yeah
we
were
pretty
worried
about
you
for
a
while
mister

two
crazy
kids
take
down
a
killer
cyber
demon
hybrid
thingy

not
making
performance
art
out
of
other
demons
that
is
since
professor
walsh
designed
it
any
chance
she
left
instructions
lying
around
somewhere
what

we
do
what
about
adam

an
idea
beat
the
crap
out
of
her
what
about
the
council

too
bad
that
was
out
first
coma
ever
and
if
not
asskicking
makes
a
solid
plan
b
what
did
you
tell
him
it's
good
you
guys
have
such
an
honest
relationship
that's
fair
how'd
you
handle
the
angely
parts
any
luck
at
least
you're
not
alone
on
this
i
bet
every
cop
in
sunnydale
is
out
there

hunting
for
a
psychopathic
superbitch
is
definitely
in
the
above
and
beyond
category
run
flee
maybe
skedaddle
we're
not
here
to
engage
this
is
strictly
recon
what
well
technically
faith
isn't
a
monster
and
as
far
as
fighting
i'd
be
lucky
to
bruise
her
fist
with
my
face
what
swimming
don't
worry
we're
sure
to
spot
faith
first
she's
like
this
cleavagy
slutbomb
walking
around
ooh
check
me
out
i'm
wickedcool
i'm
fivebyfive
see
that's
the
thing
noone
knows
buffy
can
handle
faith

plenty
safe
with
me
then
the
ritual
hiding
begins
