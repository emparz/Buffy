as
not
right

us
some
peace

can't
you
see
i'm
working
oh
i'm
sorry
kitten
it's
just
this
manuscript
supposed
to
hold
your
cure
but
it
reads
like
gibberish
eeven
dalton
here
the
big
brain
he
can't
make
heads
or
tails
of
it
oh
forgive
me
you
know

can't
stand
to
see
you
like
this

runnin'
out
of
time

that
bloody
slayer

i
turn
around
she's
muckin'
up
the
works
well
come
on
now

me

some
people
find
pain
very
inspirational
the
key

this
book
is
in
some
kind
of
code

that
where
we'll
find
this
key

send
the
boys

dance
with
you
pet
on
the
slayer's
grave
this
is
it

have
a
coronation
down
main
street
and
invite
everyone
and
drink
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights

don't
say
trouble
we
gotta
do
something
we'll
never
complete
your
cure
with
that
bitch
breathing
down
our
necks

need
to
bring
in
the
big
guns

take
care
of
her

close
to
decoding
the
manuscript
