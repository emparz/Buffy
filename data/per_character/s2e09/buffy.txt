sunnydale
puts
in
for
early
retirement

future

pretty
much
a
nonissue

no
sanctity
to
you
people

a
whole
week
of
'what's

regular
kid
and
her
cradle
robbing
creatureof
thenight
boyfriend
oh
my
god
my
dorothy
hamill
phase
my
room
in
la
was
pretty
much
a
shrine
dorothy
dolls
dorothy
posters
i
even
got
the
dorothy
haircut
thereby
securing
a
place
for
myself
in
the
geek
hall
of
fame
i
wanted
to
be
her
my
parents
were
fighting
all
the
time
and
skating
was
an
escape
i
felt
safe
about
a
couple
of
hundred
demons
ago
tomorrow's
tuesday
unless
some
unforeseen
evil
pops
up
but
i'm
in
full
'see
no
evil'
mode
i
know
two
worlds
collide
um
crossing
guard
maybe
but
prison
guard
well
at
least
you'll
be
on
the
right
side
of
the
bars
as
in
police
well
i'll
just
jump
off
that
bridge
when
i
come
to
it
first
i
have
to
deal
with
giles
he's
on
this
tony
robbins
hyperefficiency
kick
expects
me
to
check
in
every
day
after
homeroom
police
color
me
stunned
semi
mm
i
caught
one
out
of
two
vamps
after
they
stole
something
from
this
jumbo
mausoleum
yeah
they
had
tools
flashlights
whole
nine
yards
what
does
that
mean
anyway
'whole
nine
yards'
nine
yards
of
what
now
it's
gonna
bug
me
all
day
giles
you're
in
pace
mode
what
gives
no
but
i
could
take
a
guess
and
say
it
was
something
old
have
a
cow
giles
i
just
figured
it
was
your
everyday
vamp
hijinks
y'know
if
you
don't
like
the
way
i'm
doing
my
job
why
don't
you
find
somebody
else
oh
that's
right
there
can
only
be
one
as
long
as
i'm
alive
there
is
no
one
else
well
there
you
go
i
don't
have
to
be
the
slayer
i
could
be
dead
wouldn't
be
much
of
a
change
either
way
i'm
bored
constricted
i
never
get
to
shop
and
my
hair
and
fingernails
still
continue
to
grow
so
really
when
you
think
about
it
what's
the
diff
giles
we
have
work
to
do
remember
get
with
the
program
you
know
why
i
am
immature
i'm
a
teen
i
have
yet
to
mature
no
you
were
harsh
god
you
act
like
i
picked
this
gig
but
remember
i'm
the
picked
uh
giles
it's
one
thing
to
be
a
watcher
and
a
librarian
they
go
together
like
chicken
and
another
chicken
or
two
chickens
or
something
you
know
what
i'm
saying
the
point
is
no
one
blinks
an
eye
if
you
want
to
spend
all
your
days
with
books
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
carve
stakes
for
a
nursery
be
my
guest
note
to
self
religion
freaky
i
hate
when
you
say
that
excommunicated
and
sent
to
sunnydale
there's
a
guy
big
with
the
sinning
yeah
i'm
guessing
it
wasn't
a
'taste
of
the
vatican'
cookbook
so
everything's
cool
then
you
think
they
figured
out
how
to
read
the
book
so
you're
saying
these
vampires
went
to
all
this
hassle
for
your
basic
decoder
ring
why
destroy
your
own
work
speaking
of
i
really
have
to
bail
but
i
promise
i'll
be
back
bright
and
early
tomorrow
and
ready

have
to
admit
i
kinda
lack
in
the
book
area

mean
you
guys
are
the
brains

only
be
here
