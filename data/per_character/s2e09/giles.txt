ah
buffy
thank
you
i've
been
uh
indexing
the
watcher
diaries
covering
the
last
couple
of
centuries
you
would
be
amazed
at
how
numbingly
pompous
and
longwinded
some
of
these
watchers
were
so
uh
i
trust
last
night's
patrol
was
fruitful
they
were
stealing
um
this
vampire
who
escaped
did
you
see
what
he
took
you
made
no
effort
to
find
out
what
was
taken
well
what
if
it
wasn't
this
could
be
very
serious
i
mean
i
iif
you'd
made
an
effort
to
uh
to
be
more
thorough
in
your
observations
that
wasn't
terribly
funny
you
notice
i
don't
laugh
do
we
have
to
be
introspective
now
our
only
concern
is
to
discover
what
was
stolen
from
that
mausoleum
last
night
buffy
slow
down
please
you're
behaving
remarkably
imimmaturely
i
was
simply
offering
some
constructive
criticism
what
you
have
is
more
than
a
gig
it's
a
sacred
duty
which
shouldn't
prevent
you
from
ee
eventually
procuring
some
more
gainful
ffform
of
employment
uhuhuh
such
as
i
did
um
point
taken
i
must
however
admit
ii've
never
really
well
now
there's
a
thought
have
you
ever
considered
law
enforcement
what
oh
may
i
it's
a
reliquary
used
to
house
items
of
religious
significance
most
commonly
a
finger
or
some
other
body
part
from
a
saint
du
lac
oh
dear
oh
dear
josephus
du
lac
was
buried
here
he
belonged
to
a
religious
sect
that
was
excommunicated
by
the
vatican
at
the
turn
of
the
century
you
remember
the
book
that
was
stolen
from
the
library
by
a
vampire
a
few
weeks
ago
it
was
written
by
du
lac
damn
it
i
let
it
slip
my
mind
with
all
the
excitement
no
the
uh
book
was
said
to
contain
rituals
and
spells
that
reap
unspeakable
evil
however
it
was
written
in
archaic
latin
so
that
nobody
but
the
sect
members
could
understand
it
it's
not
first
the
book
was
taken
from
the
library
and
now
the
vampires
have
stolen
something
from
du
lac's
tomb
something's
coming
buffy
and
whatever
it
is
i
can
guarantee
it's
not
good
both
are
correct
and
yes
i'm
sure
du
lac
was
both
a
a
a
theologian
and
a
mathematician
this
article
describes
an
invention
of
his
which
he
called
'the
du
lac
cross'
the
cross
was
more
than
a
mere
symbol
it
was
used
to
understand
certain
mystical
texts
to
uh
decipher
hidden
meanings
and
so
forth
uh
actually
yes
i
i
suppose
i
am
perhaps
he
feared
what
might
happen
if
it
fell
into
the
wrong
hands
uunless
we
can
preempt
their
plans
uh
by
learning
what's
in
the
book
before
they
do
which
means
we
can
expect
to
be
here
later
tonight
this
is
a
matter
of
some
urgency
buffy
perhaps
you're
right
there
may
be
fierce
battles
ahead
i'm
afraid
he
was
not
overreacting
this
ring
is
worn
only
by
members
of
the
order
of
taraka
it's
a
society
of
deadly
assassins
dating
back
to
king
solomon
their
credo
is
to
sow
discord
and
kill
the
unwary
that's
enough
xander
sorry
it's
just
not
the
time
for
jokes
i
need
to
think
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
i
think
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
find
a
secure
location
somewhere
out
of
the
way
you
can
go
until
we
decide
on
the
best
course
of
action
they're
a
breed
apart
buffy
uunlike
vampires
they
have
no
earthly
desires
but
to
collect
their
bounty
they
find
a
target
and
uh
they
eliminate
it
you
can
kill
as
many
of
them
as
you
like
it
won't
make
any
difference
where
there's
one
there
will
be
another
and
another
they
won't
stop
coming
until
the
job
is
done
each
one
of
them
works
alone
his
own
way
some
are
human
some
aare
not
yyou
won't
know
who
they
are
until
they
strike
we're
doing
all
that
we
can
the
only
course
of
action
is
to
try
and
find
out
what
was
in
that
stolen
book
well
maybe
buffy
unplugged
the
phone
well
perhaps
my
words
of
caution
were
a
little
too
alarming
xander
no
no
ii
haven't
heard
from
buffy
yet
look
look
iii
think
you
should
go
to
her
house
and
check
on
her
well
riright
a
right
away
iii
don't
know
get
cordelia
to
drive
you
willow
are
you
alright
it's
the
library
willow
you
fell
asleep
don't
warn
the
tadpoles
oh
what
please
you've
gone
quite
beyond
the
call
of
duty
but
but
ii
uh
fortunately
i
think
i
may
have
found
something
finally
ii
found
aa
description
of
the
missing
du
lac
manuscript
it's
a
ritual
willow
now
ii
uh
i
haven't
managed
to
decipher
the
exact
details
but
ii
i
believe
the
purpose
is
to
restore
a
weak
and
sick
vampire
back
to
full
health
exactly
