buffy
i
know
we've
talked
about
you
going
away
that's
wonderful
news
good
for
you
ah
yes
that
should
settle
it
i
very
much
hope
you
will
she's
right
time's
running
out
we
need
to
take
the
offensive
what's
your
plan
no
you
want
to
take
the
fight
to
them
i
suggest
the
first
step
would
be
to
find
out
exactly
what
they're
up
to
maps
and
stuff
agreed
it
won't
be
enough
to
simply
have
possession
of
the
box
i
think
the
breath
of
the
atropyx
is
standard
for
this
sort
of
thing
fairly
simple
recipe
xander
now
remember
if
anything
should
go
awry
wesley
and
i
will
create
a
diversion
be
careful
all
of
you
tea
we
thought
she
stayed
with
you
they'll
kill
her
it
might
well
be
alright
let's
deal
with
this
rationally
no
you
can't
let
that
thing
out
of
here
this
is
fascinating
but
let's
get
back
to
the
point
you
actually
had
your
hands
on
the
books
of
ascension
is
there
anything
you
can
remember
that
could
be
of
use
to
us
anything
at
all
