i
don't
understand
what
now
but
you're
a
slayer
alright
everyone
monsters
demons
world
in
peril
you
cannot
leave
sunnydale
by
the
power
invested
in
me
by
the
council
i
forbid
it
faith
gone
bad
and
the
mayor's
ascension
coming
up

perhaps
if
circumstances
were
different
what
no
no
much
too
reckless
we're
at
a
distinct
disadvantage
we
don't
know
anything
about
the
mayor's
ascension
what's
that
well
now
here's
what
i
think
we
should
do
yes
yes
fine
but
we
still
need
to
consider
whether
the
mayor
hang
on
we
don't
know
what
such
a
ritual
would
require
alright
stop
i
demand
everyone
stop
this
instant
i'm
in
charge
here
and
i
say
this
is
all
moving
much
too
fast
we
need
time
to
fully
analyze
the
situation
and
devise
a
proper
and
strategic
strategem
the
mayor
will
most
assuredly
have
supernatural
safeguards
protecting
the
box
oh
we
all
forgot
about
that
did
we
let's
synchronize
our
watches
i
have
twentyone
four
yes
typical
we're
assuming
they
haven't
already
we
can't
this
box
must
be
destroyed
giles
you
know
i'm
right
about
this
damn
it
you
listen
to
me
this
box
is
the
key
to
the
mayor's
ascension
thousands
of
lives
depend
on
our
getting
rid
of
it
now
i
want
to
help
willow
as
much
as
the
rest
of
you
but
we
will
find
another
way
you're
the
one
who
said
take
the
fight
to
the
mayor
you
were
right
this
is
the
town's
best
hope
of
survival
it's
your
chance
to
get
out
you'd
sacrifice
thousands
of
lives
your
families
your
friends
it
can
all
end
right
here
we
have
the
means
to
destroy
this
box
oh
god
no
wesley
ducks
faith
snaps
the
knife
into
the
spider
killing
it
well
that
went
swimmingly
well
let's
hope
there
is
something
useful
in
those
pages
the
mayor
has
the
box
of
gavrock
as
of
now
we
are
right
back
where
we
started
wouldn't
you
say
