a
better
nature

this
way
but
you
made
your
choice
i
know
you
had
a
tough
life
i
know
that
some
people
think
you
had
a
lot
of
bad
breaks
well
boo
hoo
poor
you
you
know
you
had
a
lot
more
in
your
life

had
friends
in
your
life
like
buffy
now
you
have
no
one
you
were
a
slayer

selfish
worthless

your
choice

your
friend
volumes
one
through
five
well
i
was
in
a
hurry
and
what
i
did
read
was
kind
of
overinvolved
if
you
ask
me
way
overwritten
actually
there
were
a
few
pages
that
looked
kind
of
interesting
but
i
didn't
have
a
chance
to
read
them
fully
see
what
you
can
make
of
them
no
thank
you
deep
thoughts
as
in
must
be
tough
i
mean
here
i
am
i
can
do
anything
i
want
i
can
go
to
any
college
in
the
country

me
wrong
of
you
the
other
night
you

being
captured
and

three
years

i've
helped
some
and
now
we're

what
i
want
to
