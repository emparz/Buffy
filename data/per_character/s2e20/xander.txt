all
i'm
saying
is
it's
a
stupid
idea
to
have
a
victory
party
at
the
beach
it's
officially
nippy
so
say
my
nips
team
swim
team
hardly
what
i'd
call
a
team
the
yankees
abbott
and
costello
the
'a'
now
those
were
teams
no
yyes
but
'no'
more
than
'yes'
i
mean
look
at
that
dodd
mcalvy
last
month
he's
the
freak
with
jicama
breath
who
waxes
his
back
he
wins
a
few
meets
and
suddenly
inherits
the
cool
gene
we're
number
one
huh
just
like
that
he
actually
told
you
to
alter
his
grade
that
is
wrong
a
big
fat
spanking
wrong
it's
a
slap
in
the
face
to
every
one
of
us
who
studied
hard
and
worked
long
hours
to
earn
and
what
about
that
nutty
'all
men
are
created
equal'
thing
i
think
that
was
lincoln
you
know
what
really
grates
my
cheese
that
buffy's
not
here
to
share
my
moral
outrage
about
swim
team
perks
she's
too
busy
being
one
of
them
in
other
words
this
was
no
boating
accident
for
'students'
read
'swim
team'
yeah
the
skin's
the
best
part
too
much
research
need
beverage
oh
forgive
me
your
swim
teamliness
likin'
the
nose
cam
good
look
for
you
meaning
buffy
must
not
be
on
your
list
of
privileges
after
all
man
i
love
it
when
you
guys
mess
with
her
oh
the
cafeteria's
closed
grape
orange
orange
grape
oh
my
god
no
no
no
the
mouth's
a
lot
bigger
and
downward
like
this
with
more
teeth
y
yeah
i
think
so
pretty
much
well
it
was
dark
and
the
thing
went
through
the
window
so
quick
and
i
was
a
little
shocked
when
i
saw
it
and
hey
if
you
saw
this
thing
you'd
run
like
a
woman
too
raise
your
hand
if
you
feel
her
pain
who
would
hate
the
swim
team
that
much
though
besides
me
i
mean
what
about
me
what
can
i
do
