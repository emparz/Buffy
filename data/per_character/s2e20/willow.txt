i
think
it's
festive
a
party
with
nature
hmm
you're
forgetting
our
high
mortality
rate
okay
good
pie
charts
everyone
good
all
good
nice
good
gage
your
pie
chart
is
looking
a
lot
like
solitaire
with
naked
ladies
on
the
cards
no
point
uh
hi
there
sir
well
actually
oh
sure
i
like
teaching
well
yeah
sure
oh
good
then
you
know
well
yeah
besides
the
behavior
problem
he
won't
do
homework
and
his
test
scores
are
well
actually
he
doesn't
have
any
test
scores
because
he
never
shows
up
when
we
have
yes
well
i
mean
no
i'm
just
trying
to
grade
fairly
you're
asking
me
to
change
his
grade
exactly
except
for
actually
telling
me
to
but
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
of
what
he
wasn't
telling
me
actually
it
was
jefferson
dodd
mcalvy's
remains
like
an
oreo
cookie
well
except
for
you
know
without
the
chocolatey
cookie
goodness
so
we're
looking
for
a
beastie
buffy
was
right
according
to
the
statistics
dodd
and
cameron
were
the
best
swimmers
on
the
team
ooo
jonathon
he
was
bullied
by
dodd
the
other
day
on
the
beach
remember
really
me
i'll
crack
him
like
an
egg
so
jonathon
you
tried
out
for
the
swim
team
twice
and
never
made
it
you
resented
it
didn't
you
you
hated
being
pushed
around
by
dodd
and
the
others
so
you
wanted
revenge
didn't
you
didn't
you
so
you
delved
into
the
black
arts
and
conjured
up
a
hellbeast
from
the
ocean's
depths
to
wreak
your
vengeance
didn't
you
oh
eww
maybe
his
eyes
were
too
big
for
his
stomach
that
would
explain
all
their
behavioral
changes
so
maybe
whatever's
in
their
blood
is
what's
attracting
this
creature
to
them
xander
when
you're
nude
ii
meant
to
say
'changing'
oh
no
he
just
sort
of
peed
in
the
pool
dodd
mcalvy
torn
tendon
gage
petronzi
fractured
wrist
depression
headaches
all
symptomatic
of
steroid
abuse
there
must
be
something
else
in
the
mix
but
the
point
is
these
boys
were
obviously
drugged
if
steroids
are
that
dangerous
why
would
they
do
that
to
themselves
let's
throw
the
book
at
her
what
about
you
well
i'll
talk
to
nurse
greenleigh
the
trick
is
not
to
leave
any
marks
everyone's
accounted
for
except
sean
she
hasn't
come
back
yet
giles
seems
pretty
confident
that
the
treatments
are
gonna
work
does
that
mean
we're
gonna
have
to
hunt
them
again
