nothing
you
want
to
hear
the
ritual
is
uh
there's
nothing
new
to
the
key
was

living
energy
it
needed
to
be
channeled
poured
into
a
specific
place
at
a
specific
time
the
energy

would
flow
into
that
spot
the
walls
between
the
dimensions
break
down
it
stops
the
energy's
used
up
the
walls
come
back
up
glory
uses
that
time
to
get
back
into
her
own
dimension
not
caring
that
all
manner
of
hell
will
be
unleashed
on
earth
in
the
meantime
the
blood
flows
the
gates
will
open
the
gates
will
close
when
it
flows
no
more
when
dawn
is
dead
if
my
calculations
are
right
but
buffy
i
understand
that
yes
we
bloody
well
are
if
glory
begins
the
ritual

if
we
can't
stop
her
she's
not
your
sister
if
the
ritual
starts
then
every
living
creature
in
this
and
every
other
dimension
imaginable
will
suffer
unbearable
torment
and
death

including
dawn
you'll
fail
you'll
die
we
all
will
it's
doubtful
he'll
surface
again
this
close
to
the
ritual
we
can
expect
it's
glory
we're
dealing
with
yes
anya
apart
from
your
incredibly
uninfectious
enthusiasm
have
you
anything
else
to
contribu
sorry
well
we
have
some
ideas
if
we
could
actually
get
glory
on
the
run
but
um
you
sure
you're
not
going
to
tire
yourself
out
we're

still
working
on
ideas
time's
short
but
uh
best
leave
it
to
the
last
moment
if
we
go
in
too
early
and
she
takes
us
out
no
chance
of
getting
her
to
miss
her
window
i
imagine
you
hate
me
right
now
i
love
dawn
but
i've
sworn
to
protect
this
sorry
world
and
sometimes
that
means
saying
and
doing

what
other
people
can't
what
they
shouldn't
have
to
i
know
oh
uh
well
six
at
least
feels
like
a
hundred
yes
i
think
you're
wrong
about
that
any
luck
have
you
found
the
dagon
sphere
time
is
a
factor
buffy
well
um
you're
gonna
need
some
yes
if
you
hurry
yes
it's
time
we
few
we
happy
few
the
portal
must
open
up
there
need
anything
as
long
as

buffy
can
keep
glory
down

long
enough
it
doesn't
matter
there's
only
a
few
minutes
left
to
start
the
ritual
we
haven't
got
up
to
dawn
but
then
neither
has
anyone
else
can
you
move
no
she
couldn't
never
and
sooner
or
later
glory
will
reemerge
and

make
buffy
pay
for
that
mercy
and
the
world
with
her
buffy
even
knows
that
and
still
she
couldn't
take
a
human
life
she's
a
hero
you
see
she's
not
like
us
