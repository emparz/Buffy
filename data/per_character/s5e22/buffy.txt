hey
what's
going
on
you
guys
havin'
a
fight
'cause
you
know
fighting's
not
cool
have
you
ever
heard
the
expression
'biting
off
more
than
you
can
chew'
okay
um

how
about
the
expression
'vampire
slayer'
wow
never
heard
that
one
okay
how
about
'oh
god
my
leg
my
leg'
see
now
we're
communicating
wow
been
a
long
while
since
i
met
one
who
didn't
know
me
you
should
get
home
it's
what
i
do
that's
what
i
keep
saying
vampire
anything
explain
it
again
go
through
it
again
pretty
simple
math
here
we
stop
glory
before
she
can
start
the
ritual
we
still
have
a
couple
of
hours
right
i
don't
wanna
hear
it
no
no
you
don't
understand
we
are
not
talking
about
this
come
on
say
it
we're
bloody
well
talking
about
this
tell
me
to
kill
my
sister
no
she's
not
she's
more
than
that
she's
me
the
monks
made
her
out
of
me
i
hold
her

and
i
feel
closer
to
her
than

it's
not
just
the
memories
they
built
it's
physical
dawn

is
a
part
of
me
the
only
part
that
i
then
the
last
thing
she'll
see
is
me
protecting
her
i'm
sorry
i
love
you
all

but
i'm
sorry
i
like
this
thanks
but
we
still
have
no
idea
how
to
find
her
i'm
sure
then
we
wait
i
know
you
try
and
hurt
her
and
you
know
i'll
stop
you
this
is
how
many
apocalypses
for
us
now
i've
always
stopped
them
always
won
i
sacrificed
angel
to
save
the
world
i
loved
him
so
much
but
i
knew

what
was
right
i
don't
have
that
any
more
i
don't
understand
i
don't
know
how
to
live
in
this
world
if
these
are
the
choices
if
everything
just
gets
stripped
away
i
don't
see
the
point
i
just
wish
that
i
just
wish
my
mom
was
here
the
spirit
guide
told
me

that
death
is
my
gift
guess
that
means
a
slayer
really
is
just
a
killer
after
all
it
doesn't
matter
if
dawn
dies
i'm
done
with
it
i'm
quitting
will
what
do
you
got
for
me
i
need
you
will
you're
my
big
gun
you're
the
strongest
person
here
you
know
that
right
will
you're
the
only
person
that's
ever
hurt
glory
at
all
you're
my
best
shot
at
getting
her
on
the
ropes
so
don't
get
a
jelly
belly
on
me
now
of
course
it
should
no
no
no
that's
good
that
could
be
pivotal
thank
you
guys
way
ahead
of
you
we
have
time
okay
i'll
grab
some
weapons
too
spike
shut
your
mouth
come
with
me
the
weapons
are
in
the
chest
by
the
tv
i'll
grab
the
stuff
upstairs
come
in
spike
we're
not
all
gonna
make
it
you
know
that
i'm
counting
on
you

to
protect
her
i'll
be
a
minute
we
on
schedule
will
stay
close
but
don't
crowd
her
we'll
follow
in
a
minute
everybody
knows
their
jobs
remember
the
ritual
starts
we
all
die
and
i'll
kill
anyone
who
comes
near
dawn
will
you're
up
okay
then
come
and
get
it
you
don't
seem
very
well
i
noticed
you're
talking
whereas
in
your
position
i
would
attack
me
it's
strange
you're
not
as
blurry
with
speed
as
usual
either
it's
not
her
might
be
this
i
heard
it's
supposed
to
repel
you
so
my
guess
is

you
probably
shouldn't
touch
it
either
oh
i'm
sorry
cause
you're
about
glory
you're
not
the
brightest
god
in
the
heavens
are
you
whatever's
handy
then
i'll
just
have
to
settle
for
causing
it
no

but
my
arm's
not
even
tired
yet
you're
a
god
make
it
stop
tell
her
it's
over
she
missed
her
shot
she
goes
she
ever
ever
comes
near
me
and
mine
again
dawn
here
i
got
it
come
here
you're
gonna
be
okay
go
it
doesn't
matter
what
are
you
doing
it'll
kill
you
no
she's
me
the
monks
made
her
out
of
me
death
dawnie
i
have
to
listen
to
me
please
there's
not
a
lot
of
time
listen
be
brave
live
