um
but
only
for
a
little
while
right
the
walls
come
back
up
uh
nno
more
hell
okay
all
in
favor
of
stopping
glory
before
the
ritual
suggestions
ideas
time's
awastin'
willow
i
bet
you've
got
some
dark
spell
abrewin'
uh
make
her
a
a
a
toad
little
hoppy
toad
we
can
hit
her
with
a
hammer
okay
but
i'm
still
not
hearing
enough
ideas
she's
a
god
let's
think
outside
the
box
the
dagon
sphere
when
buffy
first
met
glory
she
found
that
magical

glowy
sphere
that
was
meant
to
repel
glory
we've
got
it
in
the
basement
it
might
drive
her
away
or
hurt
her
ooh
and
olaf
the
troll
god's
enchanted
hammer
you
wanna
fight
a
god
use
the
weapon
of
a
god
here
to
help
wanna
live
um
i'm
sure
it's
here
just
be
a
minute
yes
yes
not
to
worry
no
no
yes
um
i
had
the
pleasure
moment
and
the
blissful
calm
that
comes
right
after
it
but
that
only
lasted
a
couple
of
seconds
and
now
i'm
terrified
again
what
maybe
willow
wanted
it
to
study
it
pervert
and
don't
frighten
me
like
thaaah
god
who
who
would
put
something
like
that
there
is
this
supposed
to
be
some
sort
of
sick
joke
i
mean
things
aren't
bad
enough
this
is
an
omen
no
no
it's
an
omen
it's
a
higher
power
trying
to
tell
me
through
bunnies
that
we're
all
gonna
die
oh
god
no
you
see
usually
when
there's
an
apocalypse
i
skedaddle
but
now
i
love
you
so
much
that
instead
i
have
inappropriately
timed
sex
and
try
to
think
of
ways
to
fight
a
god

and
worry
terribly
that
something
might
happen
to
you
and
also
worry
that
something'll
happen
to
me
and
then
i
have
guilt
that
i'm
not
more
worried
about
everyone
else
but
i
just
don't
have
enough
i'm
just
on
total
overload
and
i
honestly
don't
think
that
i
could
be
more
nervous
than
i
am
right
now
you're
proposing
to
me
you're
proposing
to
me
'cause
we're
gonna
die
and
you
think
it's
romantic
and
sexy
and
and
you
know
you're
not
gonna
have
to
go
through
with
it
'cause
the
world's
gonna
end
you
can't
know
that
oh
okay
yes
i
mean
yes
no
after
give
it
to
me
when
the
world
doesn't
end
has
his
own
shoes
what
is
that
has
anyone
noticed
we're
going
backwards
so
far
it's
a
tie
we
tried
that
xander
