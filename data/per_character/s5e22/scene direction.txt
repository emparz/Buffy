you
should
realize
that
all
of
the
above
flashes
by
much
too
fast
to
really
see
the
scenes
from
first
season
probably
last
for
about
ten
frames
each
and
by
the
time
it
gets
to
fifth
season
they
flash
by
two
frames
at
a
time
so
the
sense
of
increasing
speed
and
urgency
carries
us
into
an
alleyway
as
the
previously
scenes
meld
into
the
episode
the
camera
moves
down
the
alley
as
from
the
pov
of
someone
running
fast
urgent
music
we
go
around
a
corner
and
see
the
person
who's
running
it's
a
teenage
boy
he
rounds
the
corner
and
stops
seeing
that
he's
in
a
dead
end
slowly
fearfully
he
turns
shot
of
the
corner
he
just
came
around
the
kid
moves
very
slowly
back
toward
the
corner
very
scared
suddenly
someone
steps
around
the
corner
it's
a
large
male
vampire
the
kid
starts
takes
a
step
back
the

strides
forward
with

suddenly
one
of
the

innocently
the

turns
his

buffy
small

growls
and
lunges
at
her
she
ducks
his
grab
punches
him
in
the
face
and
kicks
his
leg
his
knee
buckles
and
he
falls
to
the
ground
the
vamp
surges
up
grabs
buffy
and
throws
her
against
the
wall
he
grabs
her
again
but
she
pushes
his
arms
away
punches
him
in
the
face
knees
him
then
goes
around
behind
him
and
kicks
him
into
the
wall
he
lands
against
a
dumpster

and
backhands

who
stumbles
forward
toward

again
picks
her
up
and
slams
her
down
on

of
another
dumpster

corner
buffy
kicks
the

cartwheels
off
the
dumpster
and
kicks
him
again
then
again
and
then
yet
again
on
the
final
kick
he
lands
on
his
back
among
a
pile
of
wooden
boxes
they
all
shatter

lunges
up
out
of

boxes
she
stakes
him
with
the
piece
of
wood
the

watches
in
shock
the
vamp
turns
to
dust

light
appears
to
stream
from

a
blast
of
power
separates
them
all

go
flying
in
different
directions

clutching

bows
she
puts
a

to

and
begins
to

follow

blackout
open
on

still
staring
at
buffy
glory
starts
to
smile
then
looks
away
and
moves
her
arms
as
if
in
pain
buffy
innocently
glory
removes
her
ceremonial
robe
revealing
the
simple
black
dress
underneath
the
minions
have
taken
glory's
robe
as

continues
to
stand
there
looking
weakened
the

scurry
away
they
pull
a

of
crazies
away
from

work
and
gather
them
around
the

still
standing
there
unsteadily
buffy
produces
the
dagon
sphere
from
behind
her
glory
looks
alarmed
buffy
tosses
the
sphere
at
glory
who
catches
it
instinctively
the
sphere
lights
up
and
seems
to
warp
the
air
around
it
when
it
touches
glory's
hand
she
makes
a
pained
face
drops
her
hand
to
her
side
close

punches
her
in

stumbles
back
and

kicks
her

punches
her
again
and
again
and
again
the
minions
and
crazies
gathered
around
the
stairs
mutter
and
look
around
nervously
as
the
fight
continues
suddenly
an
arrow
appears
in
his
chest
and

falls
back

resumes
climbing
up
the

goes
around
