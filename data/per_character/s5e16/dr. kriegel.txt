okay
i've
examined
your
mother's
body
the
onsite
report
seems
more
or
less
accurate
your
mother
did
have
what
looks
like
an
aneurysm
a
sudden
hemorrhaging
from
a
ruptured
arterial
vessel
near
the
uh

where
the
tumor
was
removed
sometimes
these
things
are
detectable
and
sometimes
they're
not
joyce
was
aware
of
the
possibility
of
a
rupture
and
the
effects
she
didn't
even
get
on
the
phone
so
clearly
this
was
very
sudden
she
uh
may
have
felt
a
little
nausea
and
probably
passed
out
as
it
happened
i
doubt
there
was
much
pain
and

even
if
someone
had
been
by
her
side
it's
doubtful
that
this
could
have
been
dealt
with
in
time
absolutely
i
have
to
lie
to
make
you
feel
better
well
there
uh
there'll
be
some
forms
and
some
decisions
you'll
need
to
make
we
will
need
you
to

sign
a
couple
of
release
forms
giles
yes
thank
you
doctor
