yeah
this
one
you
don't
like
it
dawn
dawn
maybe
it
wasn't
such
a
good
idea
you
coming
along
i'm
serious
yyou
shouldn't
have
to
deal
with
this
stuff
okay
let's
just
go
with
that
it's
easier
uh
white
they're
nice
uh
what
about
an
announcement
people
are
gonna
be
expecting
a
wake
after
the
burial
unless
we
say
something
mom
didn't
like
them
she
said
that
potlucks
are
depressing
enough
as
it
is
uh
right
before
she
went
in
for
the
operation
we
had
a
talk
about
what
she
wanted

in
case
you
really
should
eat
something
this
isn't
about
the
cordless
phone
on
the
table
rings
buffy
sighs
i'm
all
phoned
out
will
you
unless
it's
my
dad
can't
believe
he
still
hasn't
called
the
number
he
left
for
us
in
spain
is
no
good
and
i've
left
messages
everywhere
um
how
about
a
line
that
just
says
'following
the
burial
there
will
be
no
wake'
or
gathering
'at
the
request
of
joyce
there
will
be
no
gathering'
uch
that
sounds
lame
uh

i
i
don't
know
i
guess
so
um
how
about
'at
the
request
of
the
family
there
will
be
no
wake'
xander
good
yeah
it's
got
uh
should
i
put
it
at
the
top
or
just
a
small
line
at
the
bottom
huh
um

iif
you
want
to
i
guess
so
yeah
she
should
probably
get
out
of
here
i'm
fine
thank
you
the
funeral
was

it
was
brutal
but
it's
tomorrow
that
i'm
worried
about
that's
exactly
what
i
don't
know
up
until
now
i

i've
had
a
road
map
things
to
do
every
minute
having
to
do
with
mom
and
everybody
expects
me
to
know
how
to
do
it
because

i'm
so
strong
time's
not
the
issue
i
can
stick
wood
in
vampires

but
mom
was
the
strong
one
in
real
life
she
always
knew
how
to
make
things
better

just
what
to
say
i
don't
know
i
keep
thinking
about
it

when
i
found
her
if
i
had
just
gotten
there
ten
minutes
earlier
they
said

probably

wouldn't
have
made
a
difference
the
exact
thing
they
said

was
probably
i
haven't
told
that
to
anyone
i
didn't
even
start
cpr
until
they
told
me
i
fell
apart
that's
how
good
i
am
at
being
a
grownup
and
it'd
be
okay
if
it
was
just
me
i
had
to
worry
about
but
dawn
it's
gonna
be
light
soon
how's
forever
does
forever
work
for
you
that's
a
bad
idea
i'm
seriously
needy
right
now
i
told
you
you
better
go
no
i'm
so
grateful
that
you
came
