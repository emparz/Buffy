by
my
mom's
first
been
doing
that
a
lot
lately
guys
guys
not

xander
he

the
only
thing

it'll
get
better
i
promise
not
forget
no
i
you
dawn

hey
we
don't
have
to
talk
about
this
now
uh
you

just
go
to
sleep
great
what
are
you
up
for
you
want
us
to
teach
you
something
uh
like
aa
glamour
or
or
i
could

make
a
stuffed
animal
dance
we
do
but
i'm
not
even
sure
it's
possible
dawn
i
mean
i've

seen
things
on
resurrection
but

there's
books
and
stuff

but
i
guess

the
spells

backfire
that's
not
the
point
the
the
point
is
it's
bad

because

she's
right
dawn
it's
too
dangerous
dawn
we're
heading
down
to
breakfast
oh
okay
it's
just
we
have
class
after
that
and
i
i
didn't
know
if
you
want
to
go
home
or
oh
okay
great
sure
uh
hang
out
i
have
a
a
break
around
lunchtime
i
can
come
back
well
i'll
try
my
luck
what
did
i
have
for
breakfast
this
morning
do
you
remember
ii
wanna
say
bagel
but
i
think
that
was
yesterday
you
had
two
eggs
sunnysideup
i
remember
'cause
they
were
wiggling
at
me
like
little
boobs
my
journal
yeah
ii
figured
life
goes
by
so
fast
if
you
don't
write
stuff
down
it
just
gets

lost
and
i
wanna
remember
down
to
every
last
everything
i
do
with
you
what
i
uh
iit
isn't
there
no
she
didn't
did
she
but
iit's
just
a
history
book
iit
might
answer
some
of
her
questions
ii
don't
think
she
could
do
any

harm
with
that
stuff
could
she
but
ii
didn't

i
mean

hey
how'd
she
know
that
nothing
ii
think
i
think
n
she
took
nothing
else
but
maybe
she
did
and
we
should
probably
look
because
who
knows
ii
don't
we
have
to
call
buffy
now
