ok
these
two
are
dead
why
vi
do
you
think
i
care
about
a
fair
fight
hunt
kill
i'm
fine
couple
of
ribs
ain't
quite
set
right
since—
i'm
fine
no
it's
just—
i'm
gonna
be
ok
this
is
where
you're
all
hiding
you
ready
to
go
or
what
thouch
them
and
lose
your
privates
nice
job
of
blending
in
girls
got
that
right

could
get
human
blood
straight
from
the
body
vampire
some
yeah
as
a
group
we're
not
known
for
our
tasteful
decor
but
in
all
fairness
to
the
race
this
place
is
seriously
lacking
in
style
i'm
merely
saying
what
you
mean
before
a
crypt
actually
but
nicer
a
bit
more—i
don't
know
if
posh
is
the
right
word
but
it
was
more
like—
work

work
this
little
excursion
was
just
in
danger
of
being
interesting
