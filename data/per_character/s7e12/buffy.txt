what
was
that
rona
ok
spike
you're
right
you
don't
have
slayer
strength
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
you're
not
strong
you
have
inherent
abilities
that
others
do
not
have
no
not
yet
but
it's
there
you
have
the
potential
you
have
strength
speed
instinct
you
just
have
to
learn
to
trust
yourself
rona
what
did
your
instincts
tell
you
to
do
just
then
no
they
didn't
vi
don't
fight
on
his
terms
your
gut's
telling
them
to
run
run
ok
regain
the
higher
ground
make
the
fight
your
own
spike
what
did
your
instincts
tell
you
to
do
just
then
come
at
me
full
speed
he
needs
to
kill
to
live
that
tells
you
everything
you
need
to
know
instinct
understand
his
but
trust
yours
you
were
chosen
for
a
reason
are
you
ok
lemme
see
spike
molly
kennedy
let's
go
you're
up
next
lesson
you're
all
gonna
die
but
you
knew
that
already
'cause
that's
the
cool
reward
for
being
human
big
dessert
at
the
end
of
the
meal
don't
kid
yourselves
you
guys
this
whole
thing
is
all
about
death
you
think
you're
different
'cause
you
might
be
the
next
slayer
death
is
what
a
slayer
breathes
what
a
slayer
dreams
about
when
she
sleeps
death
is
what
a
slayer
lives
my
death
could
make
you
the
next
slayer
oh
goody
rapt
attention
i
love
that
so
much
now
where
was
i
ah
if
we
go
with
what
anya's
resources
are
telling
us
then
the
first
is
in
remission
for
a
while
which
we
think
means
advantage
us
as
best
we
can
tell
he—or
precisely
it—was
putting
a
lot
of
stock
in
that
ubervamp
thing
the
chaka
khan
so
when
i
kicked
its
ass
the
whole
firsty
circus
decided
to
back
off
for
a
while
good
news
means
we
probably
don't
have
to
worry
about
it
pulling
spike's
strings
for
a
while
here's
the
halfempty
time
away
means
time
to
regroup
and
part
of
that
regrouping
is
coming
back
stronger
than
ever
the
odds
are
against
us
time
is
against
us
and
some
of
us
will
die
in
this
battle
decide
now
that
it's
not
going
to
be
you
i
know
you're
all
tired
far
away
from
home
anxious
but
you're
all
special
most
people
in
this
world
have
no
idea
why
they're
here
or
what
they
want
to
do
you
do
you
have
a
mission
a
reason
for
being
here
you're
not
here
by
chance
you're
here
because
you
are
the
chosen
ones
dawn
you
better
hurry
up
and
eat
something
so
you're
not
late
for
school
xander
i
know
i'm
sorry—if
you're
gonna
take
a
shower
at
my
house
lock
the
door
of
course
they're
curious
hey
i
gotta
go
uh
has
giles
checked
in
yet
i
thought
he
was
picking
up
that
chaoahn
girl
in
shanghai
yesterday
ok
well
uh
let
me
know
if
he
does
bye
amanda

i'm
all
yours
um
i
guess
sure
in
a
charming
endearing
loveable
yeah
amanda
why
do
you
think
that
you're
weird
oh
uhhuh
sometimes
that's
true
well
it
depends
sometimes
that's
how
people
relate
being
mean
to
each
other
even
mortal
enemies—
then
with
the—
and
that
leads
to
no
good
absolutely
no
good
and
much
confusion
aand
then
it's
over
absolutely
seriously
definitely
over
and
that's
confusing
too
the
over
part
which
it
is
over
so
maybe
i
was
only
gone
a
couple
of
hours
oh
look
everybody
it's
willow
perhaps
with
a
blunt
weapon
of
some
sort
and
she's
sure
oh
god
i
was
gonna
take
the
girls
out
tonight
a
little
show
and
tell
but
maybe
now
i
shouldn't
this
town
is
lousy
with
bringers
i
don't
want
to
risk
that
they
find
this
new
girl
first
you
think
you
can
handle
it
ok
i'll
take
'em
andrew
you're
not
going
you're
like
a
small
dog
dancing
for
snausages
he's
not
evil
but
when
he
gets
close
to
it
he
picks
up
its
flavor
like
a
mushroom
or
something
still
not
coming
spike
didn't
have
free
will
and
you
did
let's
go
girls
grab
your
weapons
look
it's
ok
ususally
you
come
to
a
place
like
this
you
wanna
be
seen
you
wanna
scare
someone
or
make
contact—
not
usually
that
sure
i
do
i
mean
no
that
would
be
wrong
nope
go
ahead
down
all
the
yak
urine
shots
or
pigs
blood
spritzers
you
like
look
if
i
come
here
it's
'cause
i
gotta
wring
some
information
out
of
something
large
scary
drunk
with
a
room
full
of
friends
who
don't
care
much
for
the
slayer
remember
that
not
a
being
in
here
wouldn't
be
glad
to
rip
your
throat
out
clem
you
look
great
so
toned
you
know
what
can
i
talk
to
you
for
a
second
over
here
ok
everyone
these
are
the
girls
a
vampire
is
an
animal
sometimes
they
run
in
packs
sometimes
alone
who
can
tell
us
where
we
are
how
can
you
tell
thank
you
spike
he
has
a
point
vampires
can
live
anywhere
any
way
they
want
taste
fashions
living
conditions—they
can
vary
the
animal
inside
always
the
same
comfy
moving
on
you
want
to
stay
alive
you
have
to
spot
and
identify
a
nest
on
site
look
around
all
of
you
look
for
signs
that
just
last
night
maybe
a
dozen
two
dozen
vampires
were
right
where
we're
standing
go
ahead
you
know
what
spike—
interesting
is
not
a
problem
it's
not
a
body
it's
leftovers
no
one's
safe
not
here
not
ever
see
this
guy
that
was
a
minute
ago
now

he's
the
enemy
you
can't
think
too
much
reacting's
better
could
be
the
difference
between
staying
alive
and
that
other
thing
the
question
is
never
what
do
you
think
it's
always
what
do
you
know
you
gotta
know
it
if
you
don't
if
you
make
one
mistake
