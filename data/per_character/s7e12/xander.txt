there
might
be
an
appropriate
place
to
do
that
like
maybe
outside
wait
the
seers
couldn't
find
out
her
name
or
like
her
address
or
anything
am
i
getting
the
definition
of
seer
wrong
no
problemo
oh
good
god
what
is
that
smell
uhhuh
or
some
poor
soul
who
ate
too
many
chimichangas
don't
worry
will
it's
really
no
big
dawn
wow
sheâ€”you're
a
potential
you
could
be
the
next
slayer
this
is
huge
we
have
to
think
about
this
no
we
can't
she
didn't
bring
a
cell
phone
you
are
important
now
saw
the
spell
dawn
they
can't
see
flashcards
big
ones
say
skywalker
and
i
smack
ya
she
didn't
take
her
phone
nice
job
with
the
getting
swallowed
analogy
i'll
pay
you
to
talk
about
star
wars
again
right
all
we
know
is
that
everything
just
changed
i'm
not
talking
about
that
i
mean
what
do
you
think
buffy's
going
to
do
with
this
information
jump
up
and
down
teach
dawn
the
secret
handshake
she
know
what
this
means
right
you
think
buffy
really
wants
that
for
dawn
and
besides
dawn
doesn't
want
us
telling
her
yet
anya
gone
we
got
to
find
her
before
the
bringers
do
buffy
up
here
aw
i'm
just
thinking
about
the
girls
it's
a
harsh
gig
being
a
potential
just
being
picked
out
of
a
crowd
danger
destiny
plus
if
you
act
now
death
yeah
they're
special
no
doubt
the
amazing
thing
is
not
one
of
them
will
ever
know
not
even
buffy
how
much
harder
it
is
for
the
rest
of
us
seven
years
dawn
working
with
the
slayer
seeing
my
friends
get
more
and
more
powerful
a
witch
a
demon
hell
i
could
fit
oz
in
my
shaving
kit
but
come
a
full
moon
he
had
a
wolfy
mojo
not
to
be
messed
with
powerful
all
of
them
and
i'm
the
guy
who
fixes
the
windows
i
saw
what
you
did
last
night
you
thought
you
were
all
special
miss
sunnydale
2003
and
the
minute
you
found
out
you
weren't
you
handed
the
crown
to
amanda
without
a
moment's
pause
you
gave
her
your
power
they'll
never
know
how
tough
it
is
dawnie
to
be
the
one
who
isn't
chosen
to
live
so
near
to
the
spotlight
and
never
step
in
it
but
i
know
i
see
more
than
anybody
realizes
because
nobody's
watching
me
i
saw
you
last
night
i
see
you
working
here
today
you're
not
special
you're
extraordinary
what
maybe
it
is
maybe
i
should
get
a
cape
yeah
