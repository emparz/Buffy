why
do
we
always
have
to
yell
they
were
so
excited
you're
gonna
break
their
little
hearts
yes
i'm
not
begging
you
don't
want
me
coming
along
'cause
you
think
i'm
evil
but
i'm
reformed
i'm
like
vegeta
on
dragonball
z
i
used
to
be
a
pure
sayan
and
now
i
fight
for
the
side
of
goku
it's
not
fair
spike
just
killed
people
and

gets
to
go

hate
my

with
fresh
butter

going
on
holy
crap
excuse
me
plucked
from
an
ordinary
life
handed
a
destiny—
does
buffy
know
incommunicado
yes
willow
so
captured
it
it's

it's

this
metaphor
for
womanhood
isn't
it
the

of
flowering
