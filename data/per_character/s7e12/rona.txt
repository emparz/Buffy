the
black
chick
always
gets
it
first
i'm
dead
because
he's
a
vampire
i
don't
have
slayer
strength
slayer
speed—iit
wasn't
a
fair
fight
block
his
attack
keep
him
off
balance
gain
the
advantage
they
told
me
to
run
that's
hot
no
way
one
armed
pushups
are
bull
i'm
more
of
a
chin
up
kinda
girl
i
can
do
chinups
'til
the
cows
come
home
well
what
does
that
mean
about
the
first
you
do
a
lot
of
that
do
you
gotta
go
with
the
stake
it's
classic
i
like
the
feel
of
wood
in
my
hand
all
right
let's
do
it
i
don't
know
about
you
guys
but
i'm
ready
to
kick
some
serious
this
is
a
bar
we're
a
bunch
of
15
year
olds
in
a
demon
bar
how
much
blending
did
you
think
we
were
gonna
do
it's
a
nest
buffy
i
think
we
found
something
i'm
sure
the
vampire
thought
we
were
like
what
four
helpless
girls
and
then
vi—vi
actually
yells
we're
just
four
helpless
girls
when
it
all
started
going
down
it
was
like
we
knew
what
we
were
doing
for
real
aw
no
no
no
no
no
see
i
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
do
that
if
you
hadn't've
pulled
his
legs
out
