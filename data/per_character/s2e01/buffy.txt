can
handle
myself
besides
i
could
use
a
little
action
anyway
is
that
it
is
that
everything
y'know
'cause
you
woke
me
up
from
a
really
good
dream
i
missed
you
good
willow

up
not
everything
is
about
kissing
okay
hormones
on
parade
here
it
was
pure
shoptalk

vampires
pointy
teeth
they
walk
by
night
am
i
ringing
a
bell
oh
something's
up
nothing
i
can't
handle
was
that
an
insult
i
would
have
to
go
with
stooges
also
cordelia
your
mouth
is
open
and
sound
is
coming
from
it
this
is
never
good
well
that
works
out
great
you
won't
tell
anyone
that
i'm
the
slayer
and
i
won't
tell
anyone
you're
a
moron
hi
so
is
there
danger
at
the
bronze
should
i
beware
i'm
not
angry
i
don't
know
where
that
comes
from
could
you
contemplate
getting
over
yourself
for
a
second
there's
no
'us'
look
angel
i'm
sorry
if
i
was
supposed
to
spend
the
summer
mooning
over
you
but
i
didn't
i
moved
on
to
the
living
hey
beats
me
let's
dance
xander
did
i
ever
thank
you
for
saving
my
life
don't
you
wish
i
would
as
defending
champion
you
nervous
and
this
great
favor
is
excuse
me
i
think
it's
about
time
you
start
minding
your
own
business
nightynight
like
a
rock
master's
gone
the
master
i
went
by
his
grave
last
night
and
they
have
a
vacancy
they're
gonna
bring
him
back
they're
gonna
bring
the
master
back
to
life
and
i
seem
to
recall
you
telling
me
he
was
history
but
you've
heard
of
them
thanks
for
the
warning
look
this
is
slayer
stuff
okay
could
we
have
just
a
little
less
from
the
civilians
please
that'd
be
me
we
were
close
we
killed
each
other
it
really
promotes
togetherness
this
is
cordelia's
'come
to
the
bronze
before
it
opens
or
we
make
her
a
meal'
xander
they're
gonna
cook
her
dinner
i'll
pretend
i
didn't
say
that
i
go
to
the
bronze
and
save
the
day
yeah
well
you
guys
aren't
going
i
can't
do
it
anymore
i
can't
look
after
the
three
of
you
guys
while
i'm
fighting
what
rest
of
the
note
i
can
handle
this
this
is
my
fight
y'know
being
stalked
isn't
really
a
big
turnon
for
girls
sure
you
don't
mean
my
neck
because
i
don't
trust
you
you're
a
vampire
oh
i'm
sorry
was
that
an
offensive
term
should
i
say
'undead
american'
i
trust
me
you
think
you
can
take
me
oh
c'mon
i
mean
you
must've
thought
about
it
what
would
happen
if
it
ever
came
down
to
a
fight
you
vampire
me
the
slayer
i
mean
you
must've
wondered
well
why
don't
we
find
out
come
on
kick
my
ass
i
do
just
stay
out
of
my
way
that's
not
cordelia
where
is
she
don't
like
what
you're
right
why
would
they
send
just
one
watch
her
don't
kill
her
unless
you
have
to
i'll
be
back
xander
what
happened
where
are
the
others
we
we
just
have
to
think
where
would
they
have
taken
them
why
did
they
take
them
and
not
you
the
ones
who
were
with
the
master
when
he
died
ms
calendar
we
need
to
find
out
where
one
more
time
where
are
they
tell
me
where
they
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
yes
but
since
i'm
not
gonna
kill
you
any
time
soon
the
question
becomes
how
are
we
gonna
pass
the
time
till
then
so
one
more
time
you
two
get
the
others
out
of
here
right
i'm
gonna
kill
them
all
that
oughta
distract
them
so
are
you
gonna
kill
me
or
are
we
just
making
small
talk
i
don't
think
i
can
face
them
i
can't
what
am
i
supposed
say
'sorry
i
almost
got
your
throat
slit
what's
the
homework'
giles
punishing
yourself
like
this
is
pointless
it's
entirely
pointy
i
was
a
moron
i
put
my
best
friends
in
mortal
danger
on
the
second
day
of
school
would
it
have
cable
well
points
for
effort
see
ya
hey
like
yes
