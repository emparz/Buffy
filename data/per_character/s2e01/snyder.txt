the
first
day
back
it
always
gets
me
i
mean
it's
incredible
one
day
the
campus
is
completely
bare
empty
the
next
there
are
children
everywhere
like
locusts
crawling
around
mindlessly
bent
on
feeding
and
mating
destroying
everything
in
sight
in
their
relentless
pointless
desire
to
exist
somebody's
got
to
keep
an
eye
on
them
they're
just
a
bunch
of
hormonal
time
bombs
every
time
a
pretty
girl
walks
by
every
boy
turns
into
a
gibbering
fool
you
see
the
way
these
kids
gaze
at
each
other
all
moony
you
think
they're
thinking
about
learning
i
try
and
tell
'em
about
the
important
things
in
life
discipline
responsibility
punctuality
might
as
well
be
talking
to
myself
i
believe
some
of
us
have
class
and
some
of
us
have
jobs
there're
some
things
i
can
just
smell
it's
like
a
sixth
sense
that
summers
girl
i
smell
trouble
i
smell
expulsion
and
just
the
faintest
aroma
of
jail
you
really
have
faith
in
those
kids
don't
you
weird
