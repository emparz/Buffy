good
to
see
you
sounds
like
fun
extreme
i
did
burning
man
in
black
rock
ohhh
such
a
great
festival
you
should've
been
there
they
had
drum
rituals
mobile
sculptures
raves
naked
mud
dances
you
would've
just
hated
it
with
a
fiery
passion
hmm
and
you
probably
spent
all
summer
with
your
nose
in
a
book
depends
on
the
book
hi
kids
we've
got
vampires
i
thought
the
hellmouth
was
closed
yeah
i'm
okay
what
yeah
that's
the
worst
part
of
being
hung
upside
down
by
a
vampire
who
wants
to
slit
your
throat
the
stains
