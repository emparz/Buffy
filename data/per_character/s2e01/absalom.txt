we
have
been
put
down
kinsmen
we
have
lost
our
way
we
have
lost
the
night
but
despair
is
for
the
living
where
they
are
weak
we
will
be
strong
where
they
weep
we
rejoice
where
they
bleed
we
drink
within
three
days
a
new
hope
will
arise
we
will
put
our
faith
in
him
he
will
show
us
the
way
don't
just
stand
there
dig
we
have
to
hurry
begin
behold
these
four
mortals
witnesses
to
our
master's
wretched
demise
they
will
breathe
their
last
this
night
the
blood
that
pours
from
their
throats
will
bring
new
life
to
the
old
one
we
gather
for
his
resurrection
for
the
dawn
of
this
new
hell
for
the
old
one
for
his
pain
for
the
dark
the
sacrifices
stop
them
enough
your
day
is
done
girl
i'll
grind
you
into
a
sticky
paste
and
hear
you
beg
before
i
smash
in
your
face
