mind
if
i
come
in
how
are
you
it's
not
a
social
call
i'm
sorry
i
wish
i
had
better
news
the
anointed
one
he's
been
gathering
forces
somewhere
in
town
i'm
not
sure
why
you
don't
sound
too
concerned
don't
underestimate
the
anointed
one
just
because
he
looks
like
a
child
he
has
power
over
the
rest
of
them
they'll
do
anything
for
him
sorry
i'll
go
i
missed
you
hi
i
can't
help
thinking
i've
done
something
to
make
you
angry
and
that
bothers
me
more
than
i'd
like
what
are
you
afraid
of
me
us
you
need
help
someone
to
watch
your
back
why
are
you
ridin'
me
you
have
to
trust
someone
you
can't
do
this
alone
you're
not
as
strong
as
you
think
what
i'm
not
gonna
fight
you
don't
you
have
somewhere
to
be
well
you're
wasting
time
happy
to
oblige
i
don't
like
this
there's
the
bait
where's
the
hook
buffy
what's
goin'
on
we
need
you
to
distract
the
vampires
it's
okay
it's
okay
