how
did
the
tour
go
she's
an
unnecessary
risk
adjusting
nicely
reflexes
motorfunctions
all
off
the
charts
when
threatened



bone
skewers
jut
from
the
creature's
forearms
during
battle
it's
imperative
when
ensnaring
it
not
to
damage
its
arms
that's
all
you
really
need
to
know
we
wish
to
study
the
physiology
of
every
subterrestrial's
natural
defenses
it's
part
of
the
research
we
do
here
uh
yes
we
see
that
buffy
had
her
hand
raised
again
want
they're
not
sentient
just
destructive
i
believe
actually
i'm
finished
the
slayer
we
knew
that
was
a
danger
does
she
know
about
the
project
we
move
to
the
contingency
scenario
that's
too
bad
she
could
have
been
a
powerful
ally
and
finn
will
take
it
hard
