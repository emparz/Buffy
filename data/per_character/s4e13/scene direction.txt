buffy
greets
the
fourth
commando
with
quick
alternating
front
kicks
that
the
commando
blocks
but
the
impact
sends
him
off
balance
buffy
spins
into
a
roundhouse
kick
into
the
face
of
the
fifth
commando
as
he
comes
up
behind
her
he
recovers
quickly
and
swings
a
punch
that
she
ducks
and
sends
him
down
with
a
right
hook
then
she
turns
to
the
fourth
commando
who's
up
again
she
fakes
him
with
a
high
backhand
that
he
blocks
then
brings
that
fist
down
to
hammer
punch
him
in
the
groin
making
him
hunch
around
his
pain
but
her
attention
is
already
on
the
fifth
commando
and
she
blocks
a
midlevel
uppercut
catching
it
and
has
him
in
an
arm
lock

sends
a
back
kick
into

him
to

pops
out
of
some
bushes
with
his
taser
rifle
and
fires
the
blast
hits
the
helpless
commando
and
he
spasms
as
rings
of
electricity
course
through
his
body
buffy
lets
him
drop
to
the
ground

they
don't
say
anything
but
walsh
doesn't
look
convinced
buffy
turns
her
attention
away
and
points
across
the

starts
to
walk
casually
in
that
direction
and
riley
and

'sorry'
riley
shakes
his

most
of

well
as
is
his
right
shoulder
but
we
can
also
see
patches
of
other
different
types
of
skin
wherever
skins
meet
there
is
a
line
of

chuckles
from
some
of
the
