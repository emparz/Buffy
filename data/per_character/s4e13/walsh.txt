lights
the
brights
of
a
humvee
parked
up
on
a
gradual
hill
illuminates
the
area
and
buffy
and
the
lead
commando
turn
to
see
professor
maggie
walsh
in
a
dark
wool
coat
hurrying
down
to
them
she
walks
past
the
lead
commando
who
his
pulling
off
his
mask
and
we
see
it's
riley
finn
walsh
stands
in
front
of
buffy
and
regards
her
with
a
stoic
expression
it
took
the
patrol
team
42
minutes
to
track
you
and
you
neutralized
them
in
28
seconds
i
see
well



still
very
impressive
so
you
like
our
little
operation
your
visitor's
pass
and
i've
assembled
some
reading
material
to
bring
you
up
to
speed
you
can't
take
that
home
that's
classified
material
highly
sensitive
when
you're
through
reading
those
pages
you'll
have
to
eat
them
don't
worry
it
doesn't
happen
very
often
shall
we
much
of
our
handson
research
with
the
shts
is
performed
here
we
call
this
'the
pit'
buffy
sees
a
pair
of
green
squidfaced
demons
laying
on
two
tables
while
scrubclad
techs
work
on
them
they'll
be
under
our
control
soon
enough
doctor
angleman
head
of
our
science
team
he's
a
leader
in
the
field
of
xenomorphic
behavior
modification
we've
made
significant
advances
in
reconditioning
the
subterrestrials
bringing
them
to
a
point
where
they
no
longer
pose
a
threat
the
armory
you'll
have
to
be
cleared
for
use
on
each
of
these
weapons
but
by
this
point
buffy
must
have
felt
like
she
was
back
in
class
for
her
attention
has
already
wandered
and
she
steps
up
to
a
table
behind
walsh
and
riley
she
sees
a
small
looking
device
laying
in
an
open
case
as
she
lifts
it
up
the
image
on
the
monitor
behind
her
also
moves
and
we
see
a
closeup
of
buffy's
eye
as
she
holds
the
device
close
to
her
face
the
more
advance
arsenal
can
be
complicated
but
i'm
certain
in
time
you'll
pick
that
up
don't
pick
that
up
about
twentythousand
dollars
also
monitors
the
heart
rate
of
the
wearer
a
valuable
tool
for
research
in
stress
in
combat
condition
if
you'll
follow
me
i'll
show
you
the
sht
containment
area
we
have
a
few
more
things
to
give
you
research
area
very
restricted
for
security
reasons
here
is
your
security
card
and
your
pager
we're
the
only
ones
with
the
number
and
it
stays
that
way
lose
either
one
of
them
and
there's
hell
to
pay
and
down
here
we
mean
that
literally
again
welcome
to
the
team
i'm
not
sure
she's
unpredictable
she
walks
across
the
room
her
attention
is
on
something
we
cannot
see
possibly
how's
our
baby
doing
today
that's
what
i
like
to
hear
almost
time
to
wake
up
adam
cut
to
the
lab
table
we
see
a
young
man
laying
under
a
blanket
only
his
chest
and
head
visible
but
he
doesn't
look
like
a
normal
man
and
take
your
first
look
at
the
world
i
know
you're
gonna
make
me
proud
this
is
your
objective
subt
67119
demon
class
polgara
species
though
visual
confirmation
has
not
yet
been
made
we're
confident
of
the
target's
approximate
position
as
it
leaves
behind
a
distinct
protein
marker
dr
angleman
will
brief
you
on
its
defenses
buffy
they
do
have
keen
eyesight
however
you
might
want
to
be
suited
up
for
this
why
don't
we
give
our
attention
to
dr
angleman
and
save
all
questions
until
the
end
oh
uh
well
agent
finn
deploy
the
teams
report
for
tls
for
assignment
and
weapons
requisitions
reminder
this
is
a
zapntrap
people
capture
not
a
kill
any
questions
buffy
we
have
a
situation
you're
needed
lose
your
way
agent
i've
instructed
beta
team
to
suspend
pursuit
of
hostile
17
until
your
arrival
i
didn't
want
any
slipups
that's
why
i'm
putting
you
in
charge
you'll
rendezvous
with
them
at
these
coordinates
riley
make
me
proud
i
think
we've
got
a
situation
angleman
looks
up
from
his
work
and
as
he
pulls
his
mask
down
we
see
his
latexed
fingers
are
bloodied
she's
becoming
a
liability
she
knows
it
exists
she
already
holds
too
much
influence
over
riley
over
agent
finn
right
away
angleman
is
now
using
scissor
clamps
on
the
something
we
still
can't
see
i
know
that's
why
sooner
is
better
we
finally
see
what
angleman
was
working
on
as
he
lifts
the
left
arm
severed
at
the
shoulder
of
the
polgara
demon
lying
on
the
table
he
moves
away
from
the
table
with
it
and
we
can
see
adam
on
a
another
table
several
feet
away
it's
better
it's
a
small
job
reconnaissance
probably
a
waste
of
a
slayer's
abilities
but
my
boys
are
on
assignment
so
i
buffy
no
it's
okay
i'm
up
for
some
action
i
doubt
you'll
get
any
on
this
one
we
have
a
reading
of
a
class
three
subterrestrial
moving
through
the
sewer
tunnels
just
on
the
edge
of
town
it's
a
lowlevel
threat
minimal
aggression
meager
defenses
they
barely
show
up
on
the
scanner
and
occasionally
turn
out
to
be
raccoons
we
always
take
precautions
all
we
need
you
to
do
is
get
a
visual
on
this
thing
this
will
feed
me
back
an
image
and
i
can
advise
you
from
there
i
don't
want
to
put
you
in
any
unnecessary
danger
well
when
you
get
back
we
can
have
a
talk
no
riley
something's
happened
ii
don't
know
what
to
say
ititit's
about
buffy
two
of
our
hostiles
broke
free
and
escaped
into
the
tunnels
she


went
after
them
on
her
own
she's
dead
riley
i
did
everything
i
could
to
stop
her
i
told
her
to
wait
for
a
backup
team
she
kept
insisting
she
didn't
need
any
team
she
could
handle
it
by
herself
ii'm
so
so
sorry
i
know
what
she
meant
to
you
she
was
a
very
very
special
girl
i
didn't
understand
at
first
but
she
had
something
i
don't
know



maybe
i
could
have
stopped
her
it's
hard
not
to
blame
myself
riley



agent
finn
i
order
you
to
stop
agent
finn
riley
so
all
right
fine
if
she
wants
a
fight
we'll
give
her
one
won't
we
adam
i've
worked
too
long
too
long



to
let
some
little
bitch
threaten
this
project
threaten
me
she
has
no
idea
who
she's
dealing
with
once
she's
gone
riley
will
come
around
he'll
understand
it's
for
the
greater
good
he'll
see
that
and
if
he
doesn't



well
first
things
first
remove
the
complication
and
when
she
least
expects
itahh
adam
walsh
falls
and
she
slides
off
the
spear
adam
raises
his
new
polgara
left
arm
and
we
see
the
blood
on
the
bone
skewer
he's
looking
down
at
walsh's
body
