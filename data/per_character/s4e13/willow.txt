antidemon
probably
pro
exdemon

a
normal
person's
light

busy
fighting
armies

not
to
mention
other
distractions
from
a
romantic

most
of
it
at
xander's
teaching
anya
to
play
poker
yeah
except
the
anya
part
and
the
poker
part
everyone's
getting
spanked
but
me
uh
nothing
this
is
so
cool
wow
i've
been
trying
to
find
the
dollseye
crystal
my
entire
life
well
since
june
anyway
where'd
you
get
it
oh
no
tara
ththat's
really
sweet
i
can't
it's
like
a
family
heirloom
ii
just
wouldn't
feel
comfortable
but
iif
you
wanted
to
try
out
some
spells
with
it
some
time
i
wouldn't
say
no
tonight



that
sounds
really
nice
but
tonight
i
uh
already
have
plans
with
people
other
absolutely
it's
just
tonight
itit's
kind
of
a
specific
crowd
you
might
feel
out
of
place
well
um
i'll
see
ya
later
okay
go
you
can't
go
buffy
hasn't
gotten
here
yet
she
is
she
said
she
was
looking
forward
to
spending
quality
time
with
just
us
see
here
she
comes


with
riley



and
some
other
guys
no
no
of
course
not
the
more
the



more
i'm
good
she's
a
little
angsty
around
commandotypes
exdemon
issues
oh
that's
neat
about
the
celebrating
i
just
thought
this
was
supposed
to
be
you
know
just
us
just
the
scooby
corps
you
know
i
mean
i
could
have
invited
somebody
else
if
i
knew
it
was
an
open
freeforall
what
no
not
no
one
i
meant
a
hypothetical
someone
which
is
to
say
no
one
what
are
we
celebrating
that's
really



again
i
say
'neat'
so
what
do
you
mean
exactly
you've
joined
them
buffy
do
you
really
think
this
is
a
good
idea
i
mean
don't
you
think
you're
rushing
things
a
little
not
with
riley
with
the
initiative
i
mean
there's
a
bunch
of
stuff
about
them
we
still
don't
know
well
what's
their
ultimate
agenda
i
mean
okay
yeah
theythey
neuter
vampires
and
demons
but
then
what
are
they
gonna
reintegrate
them
into
society
get
them
jobs
as
bagboys
at
walmart
plus
don't
forget
that
'314'
thing
that
ethan
told
giles
about
well
bad
info
or
not
i
just
think
there's
certain
questions
you
should
ask
before
you
go
off
and
enlist
when
did
you
get
a
pager
what's
going
i
know
talk
later
a
funny
thing
happened
with
my
prior
social
engagement
pretty
much
ended
when
a
friend
of
mine
went
off
to
do
something
with
another
crowd
she
hangs
out
with
irony
is
kind
of
ironic
that
way
anyway
i
know
it's
late
but
ii
thought
maybe
i
mean
if
you
still
wanted
to



do
something
oh
hi
you
too
that's
okay
i



don't
worry
about
it
wow
they
really
keep
you
hopping
don't
they
hello
just
left
beeped
away
by
her
new
buds
you
want
me
to
go
after
her
really
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
tropo
strato
meso
aero
iono
exo



elements
are
brought
to
bear
wind
earth
and
water
churn
amidst
the
fire
let
the
air
be
burned
did
it
work
is
the
atmosphere
ionized
shot
of
our
gang
their
hair
is
standing
up
we
can't
see
spike's
hair
in
this
shot
they
glance
at
one
another
and
static
electricity
can
be
heard
doing
the
'snap
crackle
pop'
in
their
hair
it
feels
and
looks
like
the
ionizing
spell
is
wearing
off
