'the

yes
yes

is
it
'the
master
shall
rise
and
the
slayer'
my
god
buffy
no
uh
and
and
yes
we're
we're
safe
uh
but
probably
best
not
to
go
up
there
um
iii've
been
working
their
numbers
are
increasing
yes
hmm
oh
sorry
um
yes
i'm
very
glad
that
you're
alright
uh
ii
need
to
verify
um
i
just
can't
really
talk
right
now
what
hello
uh
this
is
giles
uh
uh
rupert
giles
ii
need
to
see
you
no
ii
realize
that
uh
come
after
sundown
good
i'll
see
you
then
sorry
uh
i'm
not
really
up
to
uh
socializing
just
now
what
do
you
know
i
don't
know
if
i
can
trust
you
the
anointed
one
he's
dead
uh
who
is
this
monk
i
need
you
to
talk
to
him
find
out
everything
he
knows
just
do
it
i'll
eexplain
later
it's
clear
it's
what's
gonna
happen
uh
it's
happening
now
i've
checked
it
against
all
my
other
volumes
it's
very
real
listen
some
prophecies
are
are
a
bit
dodgy
they're
they're
mutable
buffy
herself
has
has
thwarted
them
time
and
time
again
but
this
is
the
codex
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
does
not
come
to
pass
i
wish
to
god
i
were
but
it's
very
plain
tomorrow
night
buffy
will
face
the
master
and
she
will
die
buffy
i
i
was
hoping
that
i
wouldn't
have
to
that
there
was
some
way
around
it
i
i'm
not
sure
that
anyone
else
can
all
the
the
signs
indicate
no
i
don't
suppose
i
am
buffy
if
the
master
rises
yes
that
about
sums
it
up
yes
you
know
how
to
get
in
touch
with
this
uh
brother
luca
chap
what
did
it
say
'the
wolf
shall
live
with
the
lamb
the
leopard
shall
lie
down
with
the
kid
the
calf
the
lion
and
the
fatling
together
and
the
little
child
to
lead
them'
ms
calendar
that's
kinda
warm
and
fuzzy
for
a
message
of
doom
well
that
depends
where
he's
leading
them
to
aurelius
wrote
of
the
anointed
one
'the
slayer
will
not
know
him
and
he
will
lead
her
into
hell'
ms
calendar
so
luca
thinks
the
anointed
is
a
kid
if
the
vampire
that
buffy
killed
was
in
fact
not
the
anointed
then
it
may
well
be
i
don't
intend
involving
her
at
all
buffy's
not
gonna
face
the
master
i
am
buffy
i'm
not
gonna
send
you
out
there
to
die
now
you
were
right
ii've
waded
around
in
these
old
books
for
so
long
i've
forgotten
what
the
real
world
is
like
iit's
time
i
found
out
i've
made
up
my
mind
i
made
up
my
mine
first
i'm
older
and
wiser
than
you
and
just
just
do
what
you're
told
for
once
alright
i
don't
care
what
the
books
say
i
defy
prophecy
and
i
am
going
there's
nothing
you
can
say
will
change
my
mind
we
stay
calm
first
thing
as
the
soontobepurple
area
of
my
jaw
will
attest
i
did
not
we
don't
even
know
where
she's
gone
the
master
is
as
old
as
any
vampire
on
record
there's
no
telling
how
powerful
he'll
be
if
he
reaches
the
surface
yes
good
point
uh
well
look
you
have
a
look
through
the
black
chronicles
uh
willow
willow
could
you
look
through
the
local
histories
please
check
for
any
common
denominators
uh
locations
of
incidences
and
such
well
let's
think
about
this
then
the
vampires
have
been
gathering
they
know
he's
coming
they
will
be
his
army
the
bronze
we
have
to
warn
them
stay
close
together
and
for
goodness'
sake
be
careful
what
the
what's
happening
why
are
they
coming
here
they're
coming
in
through
the
stacks
my
office
the
hellmouth
the
vampires
dead
the
hellmouth
is
closed
buffy
buffy
i
should
have
known
that
wouldn't
stop
you
i
don't
know
about
the
rest
of
you
but
i'd
like
to
get
out
of
this
place
i
don't
like
the
library
very
much
anymore
i'm
not
dancing
though
