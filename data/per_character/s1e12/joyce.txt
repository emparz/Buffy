hi
honey
you
alright
probably
just
full
from
that
bite
of
dinner
you
nearly
had
feel
like
telling
me
what's
on
your
mind
what
honey
i
you
know
the
gallery's
open
on
weekends
isn't
the
prom
tomorrow
night
or
spring
fling
whatever
they're
calling
it
nobody
asked
you
but
not
the
right
someone
see
sometimes
i
actually
do
know
what
you're
thinking
well
then
uh
this
probably
isn't
the
best
time
for
this
but
uh
i
saw
you
eyeing
it
at
the
store
i
figured
the
way
you've
been
eating
we
can
afford
it
i
think
you
should
wear
it
to
the
dance
says
who
is
it
written
somewhere
you
should
do
what
you
want
homecoming
my
freshman
year
of
college
i
didn't
have
a
date
so
i
got
dressed
up
and
i
went
anyway
it
was
awful
for
about
an
hour
i
met
your
father
he
did
and
that's
a
much
funnier
story
that
you
will
not
get
to
hear
oh
but
it
was
a
beautiful
night
yeah
buffy
there's
something
on
the
news
willow
