you
know
that
outfit
looks
just
like
the
one
you
wore
yesterday
only
wrinklier
were
you
here
all
night
something's
going
on
rupert
and
i'm
guessing
you
already
know
what
it
is
well
i
have
been
surfing
the
'net
looking
for
unexplained
incidents
you
know
people
are
always
sending
stuff
my
way
they
know
the
occult's
my
turf
now
here
is
the
latest
a
cat
last
week
gave
birth
to
a
litter
of
snakes
a
family
was
swimming
in
whisper
lake
when
the
lake
suddenly
began
to
boil
and
mercy
hospital
last
night
a
boy
was
born
with
his
eyes
facing
inward
i'm
not
stupid
this
is
apocalypse
stuff
and
throw
in
last
night's
earthquake
and
i'd
say
we've
got
a
problem
i
would
say
the
end
is
pretty
seriously
nigh
i
helped
you
cast
that
demon
out
of
the
internet
i
think
that
merits
some
trust
look
i'm
scared
okay
oh
plus
i've
got
this
this
crazy
monk
emailing
me
from
cortona
about
some
anointed
one
someone's
dead
uh
a
brother
luca
something
keeps
sending
out
global
mailings
about
a
prophecy
look
rupert
you
haven't
told
me
jack
so
what's
with
the
order
you
better
okay
so
this
master
guy
tried
to
open
the
hellmouth
but
he
got
stuck
in
it
and
now
all
the
signs
are
reading
that
he's
gonna
get
out
which
opens
the
hellmouth
which
brings
the
demons
which
ends
the
world
the
part
that
gets
me
though
is
where
buffy
is
the
vampire
slayer
she's
so
little
hmm
as
far
as
i
can
tell
no
one
can
he's
disappeared
isaiah
116
which
i
dutifully
looked
up
well
then
we
need
to
warn
her
what
do
you
mean
you
fight
the
master
and
you'll
die
uh
i'm
sorry
to
bring
this
up
but
we
also
have
an
apocalypse
to
worry
about
hey
once
the
master
gets
free
the
hellmouth
opens
the
demons
come
to
party
and
everybody
dies
okay
here's
my
question
the
hellmouth
opens
where
if
he's
underground
and
it's
right
where
he
is
where's
it
gonna
open
okay
do
you
think
they'll
gather
at
the
hellmouth
well
where
did
that
go
down
no
we'll
go
you
have
to
concentrate
on
demon
killing
my
car's
in
the
lot
don't
need
to
worry
about
that
'cause
they're
not
goin'
to
the
bronze
why
are
they
coming
here
what
do
we
do
now
guess
c'mon
the
bookshelves
giles
giles
giles
giles
well
what
do
we
do
now
and
what
about
him
we'll
see
