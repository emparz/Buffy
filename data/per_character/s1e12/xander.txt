you
know
how
i
feel
about
you
it's
uh
pretty
obvious
isn't
it
there's
never
been
anyone
else
for
me
but
you
and
we're
good
friends
and
it's
time
to
take
the
next
step
would
you
um
date
me
oh
that's
good
date
me
it's
terrible
right
see
what
i
should
do
is
i
should
just
start
with
talking
about
the
dance
y'know
buffy
spring
fling
just
isn't
any
dance
it's
a
time
for
students
to
choose
um
a
mate
and
then
we
can
observe
their
mating
rituals
and
tag
them
before
they
migrate
just
kill
me
why's
it
so
hard
i
should
just
walk
up
to
her
and
say
'hey
i
like
you
let's
go
to
the
dance
together'
willow
direct
and
to
the
point
i'm
ready
i
wanna
do
it
now
i
gotta
do
it
now
no
no
i
can't
wait
until
tomorrow
ii'll
be
thinking
about
it
too
much
why
didn't
buffy
show
up
tonight
what's
she
doing
under
the
stairs
under
the
stairs
i
don't
feel
that
boring
covers
it
willow

have
a
thing

wanted
to
um

was
this
thing
i
wanted
to
ask
you
to
talk
to
you
about

let's
go
over
here
and
sit
oh

a
time
for

i
want
you
to
go
to
the
dance
with
me
you
and
me
on
a
date

you're
not
laughing
so
that's
a
good
start
buffy
i
like
you
a
lot
and
i
know
we're
friends
and
we've
had
experiences
we've
fought
some
bloodsucking
fiends
and
that's
all
been
a
good
time
but
i
want
more
i
wanna
dance
with
you
well
willow's
not
looking
to
date
you
or
if
she
is
she's
playing
it
pretty
close
to
the
chest
well
i
don't
want
to
spoil
it
either
but
that's
not
the
point
is
it

either
feel
a
thing
or
you
don't
well
try
i'll
wait
nah
forget

guess
a
guy's
gotta
be
undead
to
make
time
with
you
look
i'm
sorry
i
don't
handle
rejection
well
funny
considering
all
the
practice
i've
had
huh
you
know
what
let's
just
not
hey
on
a
scale
of
one
to
ten
it
sucked
well
i
guess
it
could
be
worse
i
could
have
gangrene
on
my
face
apart
from
'no'
does
it
really
matter
she's
still
jonesin'
for
angel
and
could
care
less
about
me

deal's
done
the
polls
are
in

it's
time
for
my
concession
speech
