well
well
you
can
take
the
boy
out
of
the
initiative
but
you
can't
take
the
initiative
out
of
the
boy
i
can't
be
too
careful
i
got
quite
a
few
demons
after
me
these
days
i'll
play
dracula
poncy
bugger
owes
me
eleven
pounds
for
one
thing
know
him
we're
old
rivals
but
then
he
got
famous
forgot
all
about
his
foes
i'll
tell
you
what
that
glory
hound's
done
more
harm
to
vampires
than
any
slayer
his
story
gets
out
and
suddenly
everybody
knows
how
to
kill
us
you
know
the
mirror
bit
nothing
but
showy
gypsy
stuff
what's
it
to
you
anyway
drac's
in
sunnydaleway
i
guess
the
old
boy
needed
closure
after
all
tough
talk
cowboy
but
you're
not
gonna
catch
him
napping
in
a
crypt
no
the
count
has
to
have
his
luxury
estate
and
his
bugeaters
and
his
special
dirt
don't
he
no
i'm
saying

you
should
go
home
to
your
superhoney
have
a
nice
safe
snog
you're
out
of
your
depth
on
this
one
boy
i'd
like
to
see
you
try
pfft
you're
never
gonna
find
him
not
before
he
gets
to
her
