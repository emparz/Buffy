anya
we've
talked
about
this
you
own
nothing
this
shouldn't
be
taking
so
long
that's
my
radio
that's
it
let's
go
that's
my
lamp
that's
among
friends
with
bitter
enemies
we
don't
give
them
my
lamp
out
before
i
get
the
slayer
over
here
to
kick
your
ass
out
well
she
has
an
appointment
with
somebody
who's
actually
still
scary
and
if
you
hadn't
gotten
lost
on
campus
afterwards



your
better
demons
will
clean
up
after
themselves
oh
riley
and
his
guys
probably
all
over
it
no
one
no
one
else
knows
this
anya
and
that's
it
only
the
basic
stuff
you
know
that
riley
is
a
commando
and
professor
walsh
is
in
charge
mom
ahhh
demon
demon
that's
right
run
for
your
life
the
pointy
kind
and
tufty
ears
oh
and
it
might
have
a
sauce
pan
shape
bruise
he's
not
upstairs
okay
that's
a
giant
vulture
i'd
have
mentioned
it
if
it
was
a
giant
vulture
you
get
911
calls
he'd
be
great
right
now
he'd
find
himself
in
a
second
nobody
is
cooler
in
a
crisis
that's
the
thing
that
attacked
me
why
would
a
demon
steal
a
car
you
got
it
