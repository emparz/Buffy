at

a

sweeps
through

he
takes
the

steps
down
to
the

and
throws
the
banister
down
where
it
hits
a

and
shatters
it
he's
looking
around

then
is
struck
by
a
thought
giles'
voice
has
taken
on
a
low
gravelly
sound
he
goes
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
it
shatters
in
his
hand
before
he
can
lift
it
to
his
ear
he
drops
it
and
moves
to
pick
up
his
shirt
from
the
floor
he
struggles
to
get
into
the
sleeves
and
when
he
tries
to
shrug
into
it
his
now
jutting
ridged
spine
rips
it
down
the
middle
giles
grimacing
he
trades
the
shredded
shirt
for
a
thick
flannel
blanket
and
wraps
it
around
his
shoulders
as
he
heads
for
the
door
he
grabs
the
handle
and
the
door
comes
off
its
