is
a
lively
space
it's
like
the
activity
room
we
had
at
public
school
sorry
i
uh
one
time
i
uh
i
was
up
to
a
little
bit
of
a
prank
with
the
dart
board
go
and
eat
yes
yes
there's
uh
a
lot
of
new
faces
here

buffy
happy
birthday
nineteen
it's
hard
to
believe
isn't
it
the
first
of
many
uh
been



dating
long
yes
iii'm
embarrassed
to
say
that
i
actually
miss
it
at
times
i'm
sorry
well
not
uh



sort
of
between
projects
uh
right
now
uh
it's
a
personal
right
aaactually
willow
aaand
xander
did
all
the
planning
i'm
not
sure
i
would
have
gone
with
the
surprise
party
you
know
you
have
enough
things
jumping
out
at
you
in
the
dark
very
witty
perhaps
we
should
have
invited
professor
walsh
to
the
party
third
new
moon
after
the



ninehundredth
feast
of
delthrox
oh
crap
no
we
can't
wait
for
her
willow
the
demon
prince
barvain
is
going
to
rise
tonight
well
where
is
she
exactly
professor
walsh
i
presume
you're
hard
to
find
thesethese
halls
are
quite
the
labyrinth
i
felt
like
theseus
and
the
minotaur
in
the



labyrinth
giles
rupert
i'm
looking
for
buffy
summers
i'm
uh
a
friend
of
hers
and
i
was
her
high
school
librarian
buffy's
been
very
influenced
by
your
cause
she
quotes
you
quite
often
sometimes
she
sounds
like
an
introductory
textbook
herself
oh
uh
i
think
it's
best
ifif


if
we
let
a
young
person
find
their
own
strengths
if
you
lead
a
child
by
the
hand
then
they'll
never
find
their
own
footing
that's
not
uh



i'm
just
saying
buffy
is
uh
well
she's
not
the
typical
student
once
you
get
to
know
her
she's
a
very
unique
girl
i
hope
you're
not
going
to
push
her
woman
of
course
how
wrong
of
me
to
choose
my
own
words
exactly
absence
of
course
if
i
hadn't
had
to
search
the
globe
for
our
miss
summers
and
do
battle
with
that
harridan



never
mind
i'll
just
have
to
take
care
of
it
myself
i've
vanquished
a
few
demons
in
my
day
without
her
of
course
it
wouldn't
surprise
me
if
we're
entirely
too
late
demon
on
the
loose
carnage
everywhere
i
don't
understand
umm
there
should
be
ruptured
earth
andand
broken
stone
oh
well
apparently
it
hasn't
happened
yet
a
bit
of
luck
who
what
stop

of
you
uh

small
mirror

releases
a
big
yawn
stretching
his
arms
we
see
that
giles
is
a
demon
light
brownish
tan
skin
with
long
horns
sprouting
from
the
sides
of
his
forehead
curving
back
and
around
his
really
long
hairy
ears
ending
in
sharp
points
next
to
his
cheeks
as
he
yawns
he
shows
us
a
set
a
fangs
much
like
a
vampire's
he
smacks
his
lips
when
the
yawn
is
done

opens
his
sleepy
eyes
and
sees
his

a
monster
because

look
like
a
monster

a
soul

a
conscience
i
am
a
human
being
oh
stop
the
car
the
citroen
pulls
to
a
stop
at
the
corner
of
main
street
and
we
see
that
professor
walsh
has
just
crossed
the
street
giles
hops
out
of
the
car
without
his
blanket
and
creeps
up
behind
her
when
he's
close
enough
he
roars
and
waves
his
claws
in
the
air
walsh
looks
over
her
shoulder
and
screams
like
a
woman
and
runs
for
her
life
as
giles
chases
her
down
the
street
pass
the
espresso
pump
he
stops
halfway
down
the
street
but
walsh
continues
to
flee
giles
hurries
back
to
the
car
ignoring
the
gaping
stares
of
a
few
pedestrians
right
let's
go
then
while
we're
still
laughing
our
asses
off
we
go
back
to
giles's
apartment
our
gang
is
gathered
around
the
sofa
xander
willow
and
anya
are
sitting
on
the
cushions
and
buffy
is
sitting
on
the
arm
of
the
sofa

and
riley
is
standing
behind
it
xander
points
into
the
book
he's
holding
and
passes
it
to
willow
like
snapping
necks
until
everyone
is
dead
yes
just
a
little
one
it
hurts
when
i
sit
well
speed
up
lose
them

that
acceptance
buffy
i
don't

i
certainly
don't
want
to
interfere
but



this
um
initiative
i'mi'm
a
little
concerned
ethan's
not
exactly
a
reliable
source
but
um



i'm
not
sure
that

ii
believe
that
but
he's
part
of
something
wewe
don't
really
understand

at
all
though
i
do



hate

the
underground
headquarters

walking
with
walsh
across
the
large
complex
in
the
background
we
can
see
several
lab
techs
and
military
personnel
moving
about
as
well
as
the
two
parked
humvees
that
were
unable
to
catch
an
old
grampa
car
