he
was
in
my
room
angel
he
was
in
my
room
last
night
positive
when
i
woke
up
i
found
a
picture
he'd
left
me
on
my
pillow
giles
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
spell
to
reverse
the
invitation
right
like
a
barrier
a
no
shoes
no
pulse
no
service
kind
of
thing
giles
angel
once
told
me
that
when
he
was
obsessed
with
drusilla
the
first
thing
hhe
did
was
to
kill
her
family
i
know
i'm
gonna
have
to
tell
her
something
the
truth
but
i've
gotta
tell
her
something
i've
gotta
do
something
giles
angel
has
an
allaccess
pass
to
my
house
and
i'm
not
always
there
when
my
mother
is
i
can't
protect
her
what
about
until
you
find
a
spell
that's
easy
for
you
to
say
you
don't
have
angel
lurking
in
your
bedroom
at
night
so
what
you're
basically
saying
is
'just
ignore
him
and
maybe
he'll
go
away'
hey
will
willow
i
thought
i
might
take
in
a
class
figured
i
could
use
someone
who
knows
where
they
are
it's
nothing
do
you
remember
that
guy
angel
right
uh
he
ii
oh
god
um
we're
sort
of
dating
were
dating
um
going
through
a
serious
offagain
phase
right
now
in
a
nutshell
aanyway
um
since
he
changed
he's
been
kinda
following
me
around
he's
having
trouble
letting
go
no
no
it's
not
like
that
he's
just
been
hanging
around
a
lot
just
sending
me
notes
that
kind
of
thing
i
just
don't
wanna
see
him
right
now
i
mean
if
he
shows
up
i'll
talk
to
him
just
don't
invite
him
in
i
just
hope
giles
can
find
a
keepout
spell
soon
i
know
i'll
sleep
easier
when
i
can
sleep
easier
and
what
willow
willow
no
problem
hey
sorry
about
your
fish
it's
so
weird
every
time
something
like
this
happens
my
first
instinct
is
still
to
run
to
angel
i
can't
believe
it's
the
same
person
he's
completely
different
from
the
guy
that
i
knew
except
what
we'll
be
in
hiding
probably
siberia
you
know
what
i'll
see
you
in
class
hey
look
i
know
you
feel
badly
about
what
happened
and
i
just
wanted
to
say
good
keep
it
up
oh
wait
um
he
misses
you
he
doesn't
say
anything
i
mean
but
i
know
he
does
and
i
don't
want
him
to
be
lonely
i
don't
want
anyone
to
we're
good
here
let's
just
leave
it
sleepless
but
no
human
fatalities
all
stuff
i
have
in
my
house
you
really
think
it'll
bother
him
i
see
your
point
you
know
cordelia
we've
already
done
your
car
call
it
a
night
if
you
want
mom
sorry
angel
changed
the
locks
that
stuff
with
the
latins
and
the
herbs
uh
he's
just
real
superstitious
we
just
thought
if
yeah
he
was
the
first
i
mean
the
only
i
know
he
wasn't
like
this
before
i
was
mom
this
is
no
time
i
made
a
mistake
i
know
that
ii
can't
tell
you

it
go

worried
about
what
he's
gonna
do

this
up

this
is
the
wrapping
for
the
gift
