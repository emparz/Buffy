us
merely
revolve
around
her
uh

i'm
looking
for
insane
about
what

funny
if
you're
me
good
talking

nothing
to
say
you
saw
two
hundred
insects
you
gonzoed
anybody
would
have
they're
from
the
middle
east
it
is
platonic
right
and
that's
how
it
happens
every
time
which
is
a
fair
wiggins
i
admit
but
do
you
think
that
ties
in
with
laura
it
could
be
a
coincidence
y'know
wendell
finds
a
spider's
nest
and
we
all
wig
because
he
dreamt
about
spiders
so
it
may
not
be
connected
if
there
is
a
connection
it
doesn't
sound
like
anything
what
iii
dunno

the
answer
to
that
question
except
my
underwear
'bad

i
was
naked
'bad
thing'
doesn't
cover
it
with
nudity

a
total
nightmare

with
me
waking
up
goin'
'it's
all
a
dream'
it
happened
uh
our
dreams

he
brought
the
nightmare
world
with
him
thanks
a
bunch
