there
you
are
i've
been
looking
everywhere
why
aren't
you
in
class
well
i
i
need
to
talk
to
you
no
no
it's
not
your
mother
she's
fine
could
i
speak
with
you
for
a
moment
privately
likewise
i
came
early
because
there's
something
i've
needed
to
tell
you
about
your
mother
and
me
why
we
split
up
uh
i
know
we
always
said
it
was
because
we'd
just
grown
too
far
apart
well
c'mon
honey
let's
let's
sit
down
you're
old
enough
now
to
know
the
truth
no
no
it
was
nothing
like
that
it
was
you
having
you
raising
you
seeing
you
everyday
i
mean
do
you
have
any
idea
what
that's
like
gosh
you
don't
even
see
what's
right
in
front
of
your
face
do
you
well
big
surprise
there
all
you
ever
think
about
is
yourself
you
get
in
trouble
you
embarrass
us
with
all
the
crazy
stunts
you
pull
and
do
i
have
to
go
on
you're
sullen
and
rude
and
you're
not
nearly
as
bright
as
i
thought
you
were
going
to
be
hey
buffy
let's
be
honest
could
you
stand
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
a
daughter
like
that
because
they're
true
i
think
that's
the
least
we
owe
one
another
you
know
i
don't
think
it's
very
mature
getting
blubbery
when
i'm
just
trying
to
be
honest
speaking
of
which
i
don't
really
get
anything
out
of
these
weekends
with
you
so
what
do
you
say
we
just
don't
do
them
anymore
i
sure
thought
you'd
turn
out
differently
hi
hi
sweetheart
oh
it's
so
good
to
see
you
how
was
your
day
