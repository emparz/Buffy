feet
and
slams
his
axe
down
into
the
demon
buffy
turns
from
fighting
one
demon
with
the
baseball
bat
and
another
one
flings
a
length
of
chain
which
wraps
around
the
bat
the
demon
uses
it
to
pull
the
bat
out
of
buffy's
hand
then
he
attacks
her
with
a
knife
she
blocks
grabs
the
knifewielding
arm
and
uses
it
to
stab
another
demon
as
he
charges
then
buffy
kicks
out
behind
her
kicking
away
another
demon
and
as
for
the
one
she's
holding
she
twists
his
head
around
breaking
his
neck
buffy
stops
looking
around
all
the
demons
are
defeated
the
scoobies
approach
from
their
various
places
they
stand
in
a
row
staring
at
buffy
xander
she
looks
at
him
xander
moves
as
if
to
hug
her
but
she
takes
a
quick
step
back
looking
fearful
xander
gently
buffy
looks
around
in
anguish
she
lifts
her
bloody
hand
to
her
mouth
wipes
the
blood
from
her
lip
looks
at
her
hand
she
looks
about
to
cry
she
walks
forward
the
others
watch
uncertainly
buffy
goes
past
xander
and
breaks
into
a
run
taking
off
around
the
corner
the
scoobies
watch
her
go
shot
of
razor
lying
on
the
ground
apparently
dead
suddenly
his
eyes
open
xander
os
shot
of
razor's
hand
the
metal
claws
shoot
out
of
his
fingers
blackout
open
on
razor
getting
to
his
feet
with
a
snarl
we
see
that
he's
standing
behind
xander
anya
shoves
xander
to
the
ground
as
razor
attacks
the
blow
misses
as
xander
hits
the
ground
buttfirst
the
others
watch
fearfully
as
razor
advances
on
xander
who
scrambles
backward
on
his
butt
xander
grabs
a
trashcan
lid
and
holds
it
up
as
a
shield
as
razor
attacks
again
the
metal
claws
slice
right
through
the
shield
xander
looks
scared
buffy
stares
at
him
then
looks
up
above
the
roof
of
the
nearest
building
we
see
the
tower
that
glory's
minions
built
buffy
runs
off
cut
back
to
razor
about
to
strike

struck
from
behind

with
a
piece
of
chain

covers
his
head
with
his
hands

beat
on
him

does
the
same
move
that
buffy
did
earlier

up
and
flinging
them
off
of
him
they
all
fall
back

gray
ball
appears
in
her
hand
and
she
throws
it
at

covers
his
face
with
some
kind
of
goo
so
he
can't
see
he
roars
and
pulls
at
it
with
his
hands
cut
back
to
razor
still
trying
to
pry
the
stuff
off
his

up

up
and
rushes

elbowed
in
the

ball
of
light
appears
in

hand
and
shoots
over
to

swipes
his
claws
across
tara's
chest
but
the
metal
claws
break
off
and

turn
and
walk
off

ground
below
is
just
an
open
space
buffy
frowns
slightly
flashback
of
dawn's
blood
dripping
opening
the
hole
in
midair
lightning
flashing
flashback
of
buffy
running
down
the
platform
swandiving
into
the
thing
cut
back
to
now

stands
staring
presses
her
eyes
shut
tightly

opening
in
the
sky

looks
apprehensively
at

frowns
at
her
in
confusion

smiles
tentatively
starts
to
take
a
step
forward
shot
from

shakes
cut
back
to
above

turns
back
to

with
an
anguished
frown
dawn
taking
a
tiny
step
closer

another
tiny
step

turns
to
look
down
again

quietly

shakes
her
head

softly
buffy
louder
buffy
runs
across
the
platform
to
dawn
pulls
her
up
and
into
the
body
of
the
tower
they
run
around
one
bend
pause
and
look
around
shot
of
a
pulley
with
a
rope
going
through
it
buffy
holds
onto
dawn
leaps
off
the
tower
and
grabs
the
rope
they
hang
there
for
a
moment
then
the
rope
begins
to
move
and
they
plummet
downward
dawn
screams
shot
of
the
pulley
with
the
rope
zooming
through
it
sending
up
smoke
shot
of
a
bolt
working
its
way
loose
they
fall
for
a
while
and
then
something
catches
and
they
stop
they
both
look
toward
the
ground
still
a
long
ways
off
the
bolt
holding
the
pulley
secure
breaks
off
and
they
fall
the
rest
of
the
way
dawn
screaming
the
whole
time
they
land
on
some
cardboard
on
the
ground
they
both
lie
on
their
backs
gasping
buffy
looks
up
and
sees
the
entire
platform
break
off
the
tower
and
fall
toward
them
buffy
grabs
dawn
they
both
get
up
and
run
off
an
instant
before
the
platform
falls
on
the
cardboard
long
shot
of
the
entire
tower
crumbling
and
falling
to
the
ground

makes
a
huge
sustained
noise

around
a
corner
and
collapse
on
the
ground
panting

winces
in
pain
looks
up
at
buffy's
face
the
noise
dies
away
dawn
tentatively
buffy
looks
at
her
apprehensively

smiles
in
disbelief
dawn
touches
buffy's
cheek
dawn
hugs
buffy
dawn
crying
shot
of
buffy's
face
over
