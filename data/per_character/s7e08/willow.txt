buffy
dawn
oh
my
god
what're
you—
dawn
what
happened
here
what—
you're
cut
let
me
see
make
sure
what
oh
sweetie
it
wasn't
her
at
least
i
don't
think
ii
saw
something
too
and
it
looked
like
someone
else
but
it
wasn't
it's
the
big
bad
dawn
the
one
we
knew
was
coming
i
don't
know
i
just
don't
think
we
can
trust
anything
right
now
buffy
it's
ok
she's
ok
not
hurt
she's
just
exhausted
finally
fell
off
to
sleep
hell
happened
yeah
this
big
evil
that's
been
promising
to
devour
us—well
i
think
it's
started
chomping
both
of
us
buffy
this
thing
knows
us
it
made
us
think
that
we
were
talking
to
people
we
knew
mine
said
it
came
with
a
message
from
tara
but
dawn
actually
saw
your
mother
this
thing—it
had
me
for
a
while—i
mean
before
it
started
letting
loose
with
the
pulsepounding
terror
but
before
that
the
lies
were
very
convincing
it
just
seems
real
i
mean
maybe—maybe
to
confuse
us
to
mess
us
up
or
maybe
just
to
be
cool
well
that's
impossible
right
so
maybe
it
was
another
one
a
fakeout
you
got
one
too
it
wasn't
a
real
vamp
buffy
do
you
think
spike
is—
maybe
well
just
because
those
weren't
the
spirits
of
you
know
our
people—just
because
it
was
some
evil
thing
doesn't
mean
what
they
said
can't
be
true
no
i
mean
no
there's
not
really
an
increase
in
neck
injuries
but
oh
missing
people
eight
maybe
oh
ten
of
them
no
bodies
they're
just
missing
mostly
young
lots
of
girls
buffy
he's
been
feeding
on
human
blood
that's
gotta
do
stuff
something
like
what
was
talking
to
us
and
if
you
want
to
understand
it
