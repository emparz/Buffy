this
is
how
it
goes
you'll
get
angry
at
yourself
and
think
you
can
think
of
something
else
and
i'll
hear
the
clanging
of
the
bells
'cause
i
can't
stop
you
baby
'cause
i
don't
have
a
bribery
in
place
no
bright
shiny
surface
to
my
face
so
i
won't
go
near
the
marketplace
with
what
i'm
selling
lately
'cause
this
is
how
it
goes
this
is
how
it
goes
it's
all
about
shame
and
whatever
they
want
don't
tell
'em
your
name
because
nobody
knows
that's
how
i
nearly
fell
trading
clothes
and
ringing
pavolv's
bell
but
rarely
shows
it
well
well
well
well
because
nobody
knows
that's
how
i
nearly
fell
trading
clothes
and
ringing
pavolv's
bellâ€”
man
i
hate
playing
vampire
towns
