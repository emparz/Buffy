we
need
to
find
someone
that
can
watch
him

the
hell
happened
downstairs
looks
like—
oh

last
night
told
me
spike

him—two
nights
ago
it
dusted
real
enough
i

myself
i
have
to
be
there
to
stop
it
you
know
you
want
it
you
know
i
want
you
to
there's
my
guy
now
doesn't
that
feel
better
how
could
you
use
a
poor
maiden
so
did
you
kill
her
the
girl
last
night
i
caught
the
first
act
i
missed
the
curtain
call
did
you
kill
her
did
you
turn
her
is
she
one
of
your
kind
now
answer
the
question
where
is
she
really
looked
like
more
than
talking
to
me
right
the
chip
so
what—you
just
troll
the
promenade
looking
for
drunk
coeds
cause
you're
hungry
for
conversation
what
don't
play
games
not
now
don't
flatter
yourself
this
vampire
i
killed
told
me—
oh
spike
save
it
i
know
spike
this
vampire
told
me
you
sired
him
he
said
you
killed
him
dumped
him
in
a
parking
lot
somewhere
i
did
follow
you
last
night
and
you
know
what
you
didn't
look
lonely
or
casual
to
me
you
looked
like
you
were
on
the
prowl
so
then
tell
me
tell
me
what
happened
you
talked
to
her
then
what
all
you
remember
well
if
you
seem
to
forget
that
much
then—
you
were
camped
out
on
the
hell
mouth
talking
to
invisible
people
recently
how
can
you
be
sure
of—
so
i'll
get
some
ok
guys
find
me
some
evidence
that
he
did
this
find
me
the
proof
that
he
didn't
look
we
can't
assume
anything
we
need
hard
facts
but
what
maybe
but
it
still
doesn't
prove
that
it's
spike
right
now
he's
the
only
one
who
knows
for
sure
he
hit
you
any
idea
where
he's
headed
oh
uh
actually
i
need
some
help
i'm
looking
for
this
guy
bleachblonde
hair
leather
jacket
british
accent
kind
of
sallow
but
in
a
hot
way
actually
billy
idol
stole
his
look
from—never
mind
has
he
been
here
no
ii
just—i
need
to
find
him
as
soon
as
possible
how
many
girls
where
are
you
i'll
meet
you
all
right
what
do
you
want
to
show
me
oh
my
god
spike
why
what
what
is
it
spike
what
are
you
doing
oh
spike
listen
to
me
you
don't
want
to
do
this
oh
god
spike
no
sorry
ma'am
but
it's
my
job
who
said
what
are
you
talking
about
there's
something
here
there's
something
playing
with
us
all
of
us
i
don't
know
i'll
help
you
you
didn't
see
him
down
there
he
really
didn't
know
what
he'd
done
it
wasn't
in
his
control
i
don't
know
but
i'm
not
letting
him
out
of
my
sight
that's
for
sure
i'm
not
keeping
him
around
just
to
help
him
i
think
there
was
something
there
talking
to
him
making
him
do
things
maybe
but
if
it
was
it's
been
screwing
with
spike
big
time
look
there's
something
evil
working
us
and
if
we
are
ever
gonna
have
a
chance
to
fight
it
we
need
to
learn
everything
we
can
about
it
this
thing
has
been
closer
to
spike
than
any
of
us
i'm
gonna
have
to
get
close
to
spike
i
don't
have
a
choice
whatever
this
thing
is
from
beneath
us
it's
bad
and
it's
only
getting
worse
