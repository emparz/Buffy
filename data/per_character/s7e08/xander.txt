in
the
morning
sweet
mamalooshin
who
is
it
buffy
spike
no
he's
out
at
least
he
was
when
i
got
home
i
don't
know
creature
of
the
night
buff
he's
probably
out
creaturing
why
what
happened
is
he
in
trouble
why
would
a
vampire
lie
about
who
sired
him
what's
that
some
kind
of
status
symbol
for
the
undead
my
sire
can
beat
up
your
sire
you
just
don't
want
to
ok
let's
look
at
this
objectively
figure
it
out
in
a
cold
impersonal
csilike
manner
'cause
we're
a
couple
of
carpet
fibers
away
from
a
case
why
not
didn't
stop
him
from
hurting
you
hey
objective
here
maybe
the
chip's
not
working
anymore
is
it
or
is
that
what
spike
wants
you
to
think
i
don't
really
know
and
neither
do
you
you
see
that
you
see
how
he
reacted
when
you
mentioned
webs
cool
as
cool
whip
what's
up
with
that
whoa
whoa
whoa
when
you
say
we
you
mean
me
and
me's
gotta
go
to
work
i
got
a
big
client
meeting
in
a
couple
of
hours
come
on
anya
you
said
you'd
do
it
on
the
phone
you
didn't
mind
being
alone
with
him
before
nothing
look
we
don't
actually
know
that
he's
killed
anyone
you
know
lately
might
all
just
be
a
mistake
you
know
it
didn't
occur
to
me
to
look
but
thanks
for
the
tip
ok
so
you'll
be
safe
in
here
plenty
of
sunlight
for
you
to
hide
in
we
don't
want
him
to
know
we
suspect
anything
besides
if
he
tries
to
leave
i
don't
want
you
confronting
him
call
buffy
and
just
let
her
know
that
he's
on
the
move
you're
gonna
be
fine
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
no
no
no
you're
not
going
out
buffy
was
very
clear
about
the
not
leaving
of
you
ok
i'm
gonna
list
the
reasons
that
won't
happen
oneâ€”
knocked
me
out
he's
been
gone
at
least
half
an
hour
oh
an
out
of
control
serial
killer
you're
right
that
is
a
great
houseguest
so
you
want
him
around
because
nah
it's
too
dangerous
