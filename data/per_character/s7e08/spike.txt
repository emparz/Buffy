i
talked
to
her

all
well
i
certainly
didn't
off
her
where
are
you
getting
this
you
know
i
can't
no
not
the
chip
not
the
chip
dammit
you
honestly
think
i'd
go
to
the
end
of
the
underworld
and
back
to
get
my
soul
and
then—
buffy
i
can
barely
live
with
what
i
did
it
haunts
me
all
of
it
if
you
think
that
i
would
add
to
the
body
count
now
you
are
crazy
oh
is
that
what
this
is
right
you're
jealous
yeah
you
saw
me
chatting
up
another
bird
giving
the
eye
to
somebody
else
touched
a
nerve
didn't
it
it
burns
huh
but
you
can't
admit
it
so
you
trump
up
some
charge
about
me
being
back
on
the
juice
told
you
what
that
i
go
out
yeah
i
talk
to
people
women
talk
to
them
'cause
i
can't
talk
to
you
as
daft
a
notion
as
soulful
spike
the
killer
is
it
is
nothing
compared
to
the
idea
that
another
girl
could
mean
anything
to
me
this
chip—they
did
to
me
i
couldn't
help
it
but
the
soul
i
got
on
my
own—for
you
so
yeah
i
go
and
pass
the
time
with
someone
but
that's
all
it
is
is
time
'cause—god
help
me
buffy—it's
still
all
about
you
that
doesn't
mean—
and
you
believe
him
vampires
aren't—
you
can't
know
that
we
talked
that's
all
i
remember
i
don't
know
i
go
out
i
talk
to
people
or
i
don't
it's
boring
it
all
bleeds
together
not
that
the
taste
of
human
blood
that
i'd
remember
no
you
are
wrong
you've
got
an
accusation
from
a
pile
of
dust
and
not
a
shred
of
proof
i
have
to
go
i
know
what
the
slayer
told
you
it's
not
true
now
let
me
go
and
i'll
find
a
way
to
prove
it
ow
she
had
blonde
hair
a
nice
looking
girl
i
was
here
talking
with
her
the
other
night
i
was
looking
for
someone
who
might've
seen
her

just
looking
for
a
certain
bird

been
remembering
the
girl
i
walked
her
home
the
one
you
saw
and
the
one
before

might
be
others
here
ii
think
i
buried
them
here

a
song

soul
out
of
me

feel
every
one
of
them

me

help
me

you
help
me
