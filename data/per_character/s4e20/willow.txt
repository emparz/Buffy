oh
i
keep
thinking
okay
that's
the
cutest
thing
ever
and
then
she
does
something
cuter
and
completely
resets
the
whole
scale
yes
i
thought
i
was
going
to
die
oh
i
love
you
miss
kitty
fantastico
it's
so
cool
that
she's
ours
uh
yours
that
she's
yours
isis
cool
oh
kinda
psyched
out
since
professor
walsh
maybe
something
fun
like
drama
i
could
be
dramatic
you
cannot
have
more
catnip
you
have
a
catnip
problem
i
haven't
even
dealt
with
the
housing
situation
yet
have
you
done
anything
i
hear
there
some
offcampus
places
that
are
way
cool
for
groups
to
you
know
go
in
on
well
we
haven't
really
talked
about
it
i
used
to
assume
we'd
be
roomies
through
grad
school
well
into
little
old
lady
hood
you
know
cheating
at
bingo
together
and
forgetting
to
take
our
pills
but
i
don't
know
it
hardly
feels
like
we're
roomies
now
i
mean
she's
busy
with
riley
and
i'm
gone
a
lot
too
i
guess
i
should
ask
her
any
luck
with
the
disks
hope
so
anything
about
adam
they're
encrypted
crack
a
government
encryption
code
on
my
laptop
easy
as
really
difficult
pie
why
i
am
a
whiz
if
every
a
whiz
there
was
ii
just
need
some
time
what
new
thing
theythey
were
talking
about
that
what
did
they
say
what
who
said
that
was
it
buffy
'cause
you
know
what
she
means
by
that
trendy
i
knew
buffy
was
freaked
it's
still
encrypted
hours
days
maybe
anyone
suggesting
months
would
not
be
accused
of
crazy
talk
right
and
then
maybe
you'll
get
lucky
and
he'll
still
be
there
and
he
can
rip
your
arms
off
for
you
buffy
you
can't
go
back
alone
oh
great
and
then
when
you
have
your
new
no
arms
we
can
all
say
gee
it's
a
good
thing
we
weren't
there
getting
in
the
way
of
that
oh
wow
we're
already
getting
in
the
way
we're
pretty
good
at
this
xander
huh

besides
when
is
there

the
two

are
the
two

the
other
one

how
do
you
need
me
really
witch
stuff
what
exactly

you
mean
by
witch
stuff
no
you'd
do
wonderful
in
the
army
hey
do
you
think
the
umbilical
cord
between
you
and
anya
can
stretch
that
far
look
i'm
not
the
one
being
judgmental
here
i'll
leave
that
territory
to
you
and
buffy
it's
not
today
buffy
things
have
been
wrong
for
a
while
don't
you

haven't
been
right
since

have
to
face
it
