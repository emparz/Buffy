of
something
else
really
hurtful
to
say

well
you
couldn't
tell
me
on
the
phone
because
the
funniest
part
is
that
look
on
my
face
what's
going
on

got
to
be
kidding
me

is
why

anybody
think
i'm
exaggerating
riley

for
a
minute
riley
please
okay
i
come
to
see
you
to
help
you
and
you
treat
me
like
i'm
just
your
ex
shut
up
and
then
you
order
me
out
of
your
city
and
then
you
come
here
and
start
pounding
on
my
boyfriend

would
really
like

the
hell

worlds
anymore
i
had
no
right
to
barge
in
on
yours
and
make
judgments
thank
you
they
really
are

best
thing
you
can
do
right

is
it
means
a
lot
that
you
came
yeah
thank
you
angel
turns
and
continues
down
the
hall
buffy
watches
him
for
a
couple
of
seconds
then
returns
to
her
room
she
opens
the
door
and
we
see
that
riley
did
in
fact
move
several
muscles
for
he
is
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
he
has
removed
his
flak
jacket
and
turns
to
face

barely
got
away
i
know
that
there's
nothing
i
can
say
that's
gonna
make
this
better
but
we
will
find
this
thing
and
destroy
it
are
you
sure
okay
well
how
long
before

uncrypt
it
i
can't
just
wait
around
will
the
disk

no
good
to
me
unless
you
crack
it
soon
sorry
you
guys
but
we're
on
a
clock

at
that
cave
so

was
there
for
a
reason
ii
cani
can
go
back
scope
it
out
track
him
if
i
have
to
giles
you're
not
going
xander
yyou'd
get
hurt
willow
is
not
going
either
i'm
doing
it
alone
you
guys
this
isn't
helping
the
army
us
talking
about
you
how
about
you
telling
riley
every
last
detail
of
my
life
with
angel
are
you
drunk
well
stop
it
this
is
stupid
i
didn't
say
you
were
stupid
so
stop
being
an
idiot
and
let
me
fix
this
okay
i
need
you
i
need
both
of
you
all
the
time
just
not
now
adam
is
very
dangerous
you're
good
with
the
computer
stuff
usually
andand
there's
the
witch
stuff
you
guys
what
is
happening
this
is
crazy
judgmental
if
i
was
anymore
openminded
about
the
choices
you
two
make
my
whole
brain
would
fall
out
you
guys
stop
this
what
happened
to
you
today
what
do
you
mean
wrong
enough
all
i
know
is
you
want
to
help
right
be
part
of
the
team
no
no
you
said
you
wanted
to
go
so
let's
go
all
of
us
we'll
walk
into
that
cave
with
you
two
attacking
me
and
the
funny
drunk
drooling
on
my
shoe
hey
hey
maybe
that's
the
secret
way
of
killing
adam
is
that
it
is
that
how
you
can
help
you're
not
answering
me
how
can
you
possibly
help
so
i
guess
i'm
starting
to
understand
why
there's
no
ancient
prophecy
about
a
chosen
one
and
her
friends
if
i
need
help
i'll
go
to
someone
i
can
count
on
