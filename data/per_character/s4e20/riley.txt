do
you
know
if
she's
back
yet
would
this
man
have
a
bright
red
nose
and
big
floppy
feet
hey
i'm
sorry
that's
the
cabin
fever
talking
i've
done
wonders
with
the
place
still
the
sooner
buffy
gets
back
the
better
i'll
feel
i
take
it
you're
not
an
angel
fan
either
can't
blame
you
but
to
be
fair
it's
not
him
you
hate
it's
the
curse
right
on
angel
everything
more
than
i
wanted
to
know
sometimes
she
loved
him
he
turned
evil
he
uh
killed
people
she
cured
him
he
left
interesting
little
curse
what
do
you
mean
and
that
sets
him
off
buffy
xander
nods
opening
his
palms
in
a
there
you
go
gesture
riley
dwells
on
this
for
a
moment
and
it
dawns
on
him
sex
with
buffy
yeah
she
did
that
explains
a
lot
of
things
that
i
wish
weren't
explained
she
went
running
to
la
to
bone
up
on
her
history
maybe
i
guess
we'll
see
i
got
a
little
tired
of
sitting
around
waiting
so
xander
took
my
clothes
to
clean
'em
and
left
me
these
does
he
uh
hate
me
in
some
way
i
don't
know
about
yet
i
think
i
would've
attracted
less
attention
in
my
uniform
you
tell
me
i'm
good
and
uh
it
took
me
a
while
but
i
patched
into
their
frequency
can't
sneak
up
on
a
guy
if
he's
listening
in
why
they
hired
me
you
okay
how
got
my
attention
you
don't
want
to
talk
about
it
it's
the
pants
isn't
it
it's
okay
i
couldn't
take
me
seriously
in
these
things
either
tell
you
what
why
don't
i
get
out
of
your
face
you
had
a
long
trip
it's
okay
besides
heh
i
have
to
recharge
them
every
two
hours
or
they
go
dead
on
me
i
know
you
angel
way
i
heard
it
you
were
all
peaceable
now
you
didn't
by
any
chance
go
and
lose
that
pesky
soul
again
did
you
now
what
possibly
could've
happened
with
buffy
that
would
make
you
lose
your
soul
where
do
you
think
you're
going
oh
you
really
think
i'm
gonna
let
that
happen
i
surely
do
i
told
you
you
weren't
coming
near
her
it's
pretty
much
all
i
got
left
so
i'm
thinking
not
he
attacked
four
of
my
men
buffy
i
think
he's
up
to
his
old
tricks
please
try
trigger
finger
feels
okay
i'm
sorry
just
wanted
to
know
that
you
were
safe
what
i'm
not
leaving
this
room
i
mean
it
not
moving
a
muscle
dunno
yet
night's
still
young
figured
i'm
fine
wait
me
first
buffy
i
feel
like
we've
gotten
really
close
at
least
i
thought
we
had
i
don't
know
much
about
angel
or
your
relationship
with
him
but
all
i
ask
is
if
you're
gonna
break
heart
do
it
fast
didn't
you
i
don't
know
xander
said
no
it's
not
his
fault
i
prodded
and
he
explained
how
angel
went
bad
the
uh
trigger
and
uh
after
that
i
went
a
little
nuts
you
know
i
mean
on
the
one
hand
i
should
believe
in
us
but
on
the
other
sometimes
things
happen
between
exes
and
when
i
saw
that
he
was
bad
seriously
that's
a
good
day
well
there
you
go
even
when
he's
good
he's
all
mister
billowy
coat
king
of
pain
and
girls
really
see
nuts
no
because
i'm
so
in
love
with
you
i
can't
think
straight
just
say
it
i
have
to
go
i
have
to
go
now
and
now
i'm
here
