i
walked
by
your
guidance
counselor's
office
one
time
a
bunch
of
you
were
sitting
there

waiting
to
be
shepherded
i
remember
it
smelled
like
dead
flowers
like
decay
then
it
hit
me
the
hope
of
our
nation's
future
is
a
bunch
of
mulch
where
are
you
heading
your
time
is
running
out
are
you
a
soldier
you're
neither
you're
a
whipping
boy
raised
by
mongrels
and
set
on
a
sacrificial
stone
