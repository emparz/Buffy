hey
where
you
been
all
night
well
congratulations
i
see
you
and
buffy
have
finally
gotten
past
the
shy
phase
what
things
this
is
mighty
ominous
what's
up
man
what
did
buffy
tell
you
that
i
mean
do
you
have
any
proof
i
don't
get
it
why
i
wouldn't
put
it
past
buffy
to
get
on
professor
walsh's
bad
side
she
tends
to
put
her
nose
where
it
doesn't
belong
she's
a
pain
always
wanting
to
know
why
this
and
why
that
i
don't
know
maybe
professor
walsh
found
out
that
buffy
was
up
to
something
bad
that
ever
cross
your
mind
it
bugs
me
that
she's
using
you
to
infiltrate
our
operations
riley
think
about
it
the
professor
is
not
stupid
if
she
tried
to
kill
buffy
maybe
buffy
needed
killing
what
is
it
look
at
that
wound
she's
been
staked
wouldn't
you
say
brother
only
one
person
i
can
think
of
who
could
do
something
like
that
no
way
that's
your
girlfriend's
mo
then
bring
'em
on
that
supernatural
freak
has
blinded
you
and
i'm
sick
of
it
somebody's
been
staying
here
could
be
or
a
squatter
of
the
demon
variety
who
cares
i
see
a
demon
it
dies
damn
animals
right
and
you
just
happened
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
we'll
take
it
from
here
it's
a
military
hospital
back
off
we
take
care
of
our
own
around
here
understand
escort
them
out
