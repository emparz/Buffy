what
am
i
i
thought
so
what
are
you
a
boy
how
do
you
work
me
i've
been
thinking
about
the
world
i
wanted
to
see
it
learn
it
i
saw
the
inside
of
that
boy
and
it
was
beautiful
but
it
didn't
tell
me
about
the
world
it
just
made
me
feel
so
now



i
want
to
learn
about
me
why
i
feel
what
i
am
so
i
came
home
i'm
a
kinematically
redundant
biomechanical
demonoid
designed
by
maggie
walsh
she
called
me
adam
and
i
called
her
mother
yes
but
i
seem
to
have
a
design
flaw
in
addition
to
organic
material
i'm
equipped
with
gp2d11
infrared
detectors
a
harmonic
decelerator
plus
dc
servo
and
man
and
machine
which
tells
me
what
i
am


but
not
who
i
am
mother
wrote
things
down
hard
data
but
also
her
feelings
that's
how
i
learned
that
i
have
a
job
here
and
that
she
loved
me
riley
finn
oh
mother
created
you
too
a
birth
mother
yes
but
after
you
met
maggie
she
was
the
one
who
shaped
your
basic
operating
system
she
taught
you
how
to
think
how
to
feel
she
fed
you
chemicals
to
make
you
stronger
your
mind
and
body
she
said
that
you
and
i
were
her
favorite
children
her
art
that
makes
us
brothers
family
that's
pain
isn't
it
why
because
your
feeding
schedule
the
chemicals
have
been
interrupted
or
do
you
miss
her
tell
me
you
won't
you
haven't
been
programmed
to
it's
here
the
plan
she
had
for
us
what
happens
how
it
ends
do
you
want
to
hear
doctor
thank
you
this
has
been



very
interesting
