buffy
god
buffy
are
you
okay
what
happened
i
know
something
went
down
tell
me
okay
listen
i
need
you
to
go
over
everything
step
by
step
there
has
has
to
be
some
kind
of
mistake
i
was
on
a
mission
but
i
came
back
and



i'm
not
sure
look
let's
just
keep
our
heads
and
not
jump
to
any
that's
hostile
17
we've
been
looking
all
over
the
place
for
him
but
you've
known
where
he's
been
all
along
then
what
is
it
like
what's
he
doing
here
buffy



what
is
this
you're
hiding
an
hst
ii
didn't
see
much
i
wasn't
there
i



all
i
know
is
professor
walsh
told
me
you
were
dead
but
then
i
saw
you
on
the
monitors



look
this
isn't
professor
walsh
there
must
be
something
making
her
act
this
way
something
i
i
don't
know
controlling
her
maybe
she
was
trying
to
test
you
what
if
it
was
only
a
drill
no
that's



that's
not
what
happens
there
i
would
know
i
can't
be
here
i'll
sort
it
out
on
my
own
no
just
i'm
sorry
i
wasn't
with
buffy
i
needed
to
be
alone
think
some
things
through
professor
walsh
tried
to
have
buffy
killed
i
saw
enough
to
know
it's
true
i
don't
know
buffy
thinks
that
she's
getting
too
close
to
something
that
professor
walsh
has
some
secret
what
and
you're
saying
she
should
die
because
of
that
why
does
it
bug
you
so
much
that
i'm
hanging
with
her
is
it
because
she's
a
better
soldier
than
you
so
you're
saying
she's
a
spy
you're
crazy
not
now
graham
what
you
better
not
be
saying
what
i
think
you're
saying
wewe
don't
know
that
a
person
did
this
the
polgara
demon
has
a
skewer
that
comes
right
out
of
hey
that's
a
serious
accusation
you
better
be
ready
to
deal
with
the
consequences
that's
enough
no
sir
what
do
you
mean
wait
this
has
to
be
the
work
of
the
polgara
demon
we
captured
last
week
it's
out
loose
somewhere
then
we
have
to
go
after
it
listen
angleman
can
talk
all
he
wants
but
i'm
still
in
charge
until
the
brass
gets
here
and
tells
me
otherwise
i
say
we
got
a
demon
to
hunt
now
suit
up
for
armed
patrol
and
by
that
i
mean
loaded
guns
man
target
practice
is
over
we're
going
for
blood
buffy
hey
maggie's
dead
happy
now
that's
classified
you
told
me
you
were
tracking
the
polgara
demon
i
thought
i'd
help
but
now
i
see
you're
not
hunting
demons
you're
socializing
with
them
again
i
thought
you
were
supposed
to
be
killing
these
things
not
buying
them
drinks
i'm
serious
buffy
what
are
you
doing
here
i
want
you
to
tell
me
who
are
you
really
hey
you
think
you
can
shut
up
i
said
shut
up
or
maybe
you
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
lab
with
me
i'm
sure
the
coats
would
love
to
classify
a



whatever
you
are
so
he's
human
he
just
harbors
demons
which
makes
him
a
good
guy
like
you
the
truth
buffy
now
hold
it
you
no
leaving
until
i
say
so
got
it
right
except
the
rules
don't
seem
to
apply
much
these
days
do
they
like
if
i
shot
you
right
now
i
don't
know
if
i'd
have
a
corpse
on
my
hands
or
one
pissed
off
vampire

mean
who
do
you
believe
first
it
sounds
like
lies
then
it
sounds
like
truth

happening
to
me
i
can't
it's
like



something's
growing
inside
