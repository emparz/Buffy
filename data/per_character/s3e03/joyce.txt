morning
sunshine
ready
to
face
the
beast
i'm
not
sure
i
like
your
attitude
mr
snyder
i
spoke
with
the
school
board
and
according
to
them
i
think
what
my
daughter's
trying
to
say
is
nyah
nyahnyahnyah
nyah
so
you're
a
slayer
too
isn't
that
interesting
do
you
like
it
uh
just
a
second
honey
you
know
buffy
never
talks
that
way
why
do
you
love
it
right
right
that
could
get
you
hurt
buffy
can
be
awfully
negative
sometimes
see
honey
you
gotta
fight
that
oh
faith
can
i
get
you
another
soft
drink
right
i
like
this
girl
buffy
now
buffy
does
anybody
else
think
faith
is
creepy
it's
probably
good
you
were
an
only
child
well
there
are
some
things
i'd
be
happy
to
see
you
share
like
the
slaying
i
mean
two
of
you
fighting
is
safer
than
one
right
unless
i
mean
you
heard
her
she
loves
the
slaying
couldn't
she
take
over
for
you
but
you're
going
to
college
next
year
i
think
it
would
be
then
that
means
you
when
did
you
die
you
never
told
me
you
died
oh
i
hate
this
i
hate
your
life
look
ii
know
you
didn't
choose
this
i
know
it
chose
you
i
have
tried
to
march
in
the
'slayer
pride'
parade
but
i
don't
want
you
to
die
oh
