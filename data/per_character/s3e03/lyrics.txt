everything
is
quiet
buffy
i
miss
you
since
you're
not
around
buffy
moves
her
left
hand
with
her
claddagh
ring
down
angel's
arm
to
take
his
hand
and
i
live
in
the
numbness
now
the
ring
is
loose
on
her
finger
and
before
she
can
clasp
his
hand
it
falls
off
and
clinks
on
the
floor
in
the
background
angel
and
buffy
both
look
down
at
the
ring
i
do
the
things
we
did
before
angel
reaches
down
to
pick
up
the
ring
the
music
fades
out
i
walk
haight
street
to
the
store
angel
stands
back
up
holding
the
ring
he
gives
buffy
a
wounded
look
i've
given
you
every
part
of
me

tried
everything
i
could
to
make
you
see
another
couple
leaves
the
dance
floor
and
the
camera
follows
them
until
they
pass
by
an
alcove
furnished
like
a
turnofthecentury
parlor
with
a
love
seat
a
couple
of
armchairs
tables
and
a
lamp
with
a
pink
shade
but
you
don't
love
yourself
buffy
walks
into
view
from
behind
carrying
drinks
and
heads
for
them
you
can't
love
me
or
anyone
else
willow
notices
buffy's
cheery
mood
and
smiles
as
oz
accepts
another
drink
from
her
and
passes
one
to
willow
you
said
i
was
the
best
thing
in
your
life
scott
approaches
them
is
that
why
you
run
why
you
hide
you
will
never
be
the
cure
buffy
hi
scott
and
you
will
never
change
scott
don't
you
love
this
song
you
will
never
be
the
cure
scott
well
would
you
like
to
and
you
will
never
change
buffy
i
don't
know
i'm
bad
with
well
you
will
never
be
the
cure
buffy
thank
you
for
asking
it's
just
that
there
i've
given
you
every
part
of
me
scott
walks
off
to
find
a
place
to
wait
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
and
flops
her
head
back
mentally
kicking
herself
for
the
way
she
handled
that
tried
everything
i
could
to
make
you
see
oz
plus
bonus
points
for
use
of
the
word
'mosey'
but
you
don't
love
yourself
cordelia
and
xander
walk
up
you
can't
love
me
or
anyone
else
the
couple
continues
to
dance
getting
close
and
touching
each
other
at
one
point
then
separating
again
you
said
i
was
the
best
thing
in
your
life
buffy
begins
to
really
wonder
about
them
the
couple
gets
close
again
and
the
girl
extends
her
arm
pointing
at
the
door
the
guy
takes
the
hint
and
leads
her
out
with
his
arm
around
her
buffy
watches
them
go
suspicious
of
his
intentions
she
sees
him
say
bye
to
his
buddy
and
head
for
the
door
