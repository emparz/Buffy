buffy
good
timing
i
could
use
your
help
i
trust
you
remember
the
demon
acathla
oh
ahhhh
well
i
um
wellw
o
oof
course
it's
wonderful
to
have
you
back
iiit
goes
without
saying
but
you
enjoy
making
me
say
it
don't
you
we
need
to
make
sure
that
he
remains
dormant
and
that
the
dimensional
vortex
is
sealed
tight
so
i'm
working
on
a
binding
spell
possibly
with
the
research
it's
very
sensitive
and
and
difficult
spell
it
involves
creating
a
aa
protective
circle
around
well
i
don't
want
to
bore
you
with
the
details
but
uh
well
there's
a
litany
ththat
one
has
to
recite
in
aramaic
and
it's
very
specific
so
i
need
to
get
a
few
details
about
your
experience
of
defeating
acathla
and
angel
i've
put
the
time
at
about
um
617
around
about
half
an
hour
after
xander
rescued
me
oh
was
the
vortex
already
open
i
see
and
angel
yes
well
that
um
should
be
very
helpful
these
forces
are
not
something
that
one
plays
around
with
willow
what
have
you
been
conjuring
no
of
course
not
no
if
i
were
i
would
be
making
a
strange
clucking
sound
with
my
tongue
there's
a
watchers'
retreat
every
year
in
the
cotswolds
it's
a
lovely
spot
it's
very
sserene
there's
horse
riding
and
hiking
and
punting
well
um
uh
leaving
aside
for
a
moment
my
uh
youth
and
beauty
i'di'd
say
it
was
um
fortuitous
that
faith
arrived
when
she
did
yes
well
i
don't
know
how
big
an
evil
it
is
but
uh
two
people
have
disappeared
from
the
sunset
ridge
district
this
um
this
new
girl
seems
to
iii've
been
having
a
little
problem
with
the
uh
binding
spell
for
acathla
iii'm
lacking
the
the
requisite
details
to
perform
it
correctly
now
physical
location
acathla
was
facing
south
now
see
that's
what
i
thought
but
i
what
you
must
realize
buffy
is
that
you
and
faith
have
very
different
temperaments
you
said
yourself
that
sheshe
killed
one
shsheshe's
just
a
plucky
fighter
who
got
a
little
carried
away
which
is
natural
she's
focused
on
the
slaying
she
doesn't
have
a
whole
other
life
here
as
you
do
i
think
you're
being
a
little
all
right
i'll
see
if
i
can
reach
her
watcher
at
the
retreat
they're
eight
hours
ahead
now
i
guess
they're
probably
sitting
down
to
a
nightcap
i
wonder
if
they
still
kayak
i
used
to
love
a
good
kayak
you
see
tthey
don't
even
consider
sorry
i
digress
the
um
vampires
that
attacked
you
can
you
furnish
me
with
some
details
that
might
help
me
trace
their
lineage
i
mean
ancient
ororor
modern
dress
amulets
cultish
tattoos
you
mean
'kakistos'
kakistos
'kakistos'
is
greek
it
means
the
worst
of
the
worst
it's
also
the
name
of
a
vampire
so
old
that
his
hands
and
feet
are
cloven
you
think
he
and
faith
are
connected
well
buffy
it's
entirely
possible
that
they
both
arrived
here
by
chance
simultaneously
as
far
as
i
know
yes
kakistos
right
are
you
all
right
yes
i
did
her
watcher's
dead
the
council
has
approved
our
request
faith
is
to
stay
here
indefinitely
i'm
to
look
after
you
both
until
a
new
watcher
is
assigned
i'm
glad
to
hear
it
i'm
sorry
uh
yes
i
i
believe
it
will
there
is
no
spell
