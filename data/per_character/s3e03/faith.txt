i'm
faith
can
i
borrow
that
thanks
b
couldn't
have
done
it
without
you
the
whole
summer
it
was
like
the
worst
heat
wave
so
it's
about
a
hundred
and
eighteen
degrees
and
i'm
sleeping
without
a
stitch
on
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
hear
this
screaming
from
outside
so
i
go
tearing
out
stark
nude
and
this
church
bus
has
broke
down
and
there's
these
three
vamps
feasting
on
half
the
baptists
in
south
boston
so
i
waste
the
vamps
and
the
preacher
comes
up
and
he's
hugging
me
like
there's
no
tomorrow
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
cops
pull
up
and
they
arrested
us
both
god
i
could
eat
a
horse
isn't
it
crazy
how
slayin'
just
always
makes
you
hungry
and
horny
well
i
wasn't
my
watcher
went
off
to
some
retreat
thing
in
england
and
so
i
skipped
out
i
figured
this
was
my
chance
to
meet
the
infamous
buff
and
compare
notes
so
b
did
you
really
use
a
rocket
launcher
one
time
oh

this
big
daddy
vampire
out
of
missouri
who
used
to
keep
them
as
pets
so
he's
got
me
rasslin'
one
of
'em
okay

have
been
twelve
feet
long

had
more
trouble
than
that
