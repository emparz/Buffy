buffy
well
i'm
relieved
that
you're
home
because
to
be
honest
i
wasn't
feeling
all
that
safe
with
you
gone
at
first
and
then
i
um
remembered
that
um
rupert
was
here
and
i
felt
much
much
safer
good
night
dawn
is
dawn
with
you
no
she
didn't
come
home
from
school
today
oh
buffy
the
news
said
something
about
people
murdered
buffy
it's
not
glory
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
dawn
i
promise
look
she
probably

i'll
find
her
but
what
they
didn't
get
was
that
it
was
a
copy
of
the
bill
of
lading
so
they
thought
that
it
was
another
order
form
so
now
i've
got
two
shipments
of
greek
amphorae
on
my
hands
oh
buffy
spike
came
by
to
apologize
for
yesterday
our
missing
child
drama
oh
well
i
got
talking
about
the
gallery
see
there
was
this
spike
oh
don't
get
us
all
laughing
again
joyce
anyhow
i
really
need
to
talk
to
your
eldest
honey
did
you

somehow
unintentionally
lead
him
on
in
any
way
uh
send
him
signals
so
am
i
he
could
become
dangerous
yeah
and
spike
i
mean
he's
yeah
i
know
this
is
hard
honey
but
i
think
you
made
the
right
decision
better
to
nip
this
in
the
bud
before
buffy
the
bud
nips
me
exactly
