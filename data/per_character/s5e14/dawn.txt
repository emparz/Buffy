looking

around
town
in
the
daytime
i
mean
does
that
lead
into
the
sewers
or
something
can
you
show
me

nothing
would
make
her
happier
than
to
find
out
i'm
hanging
out
after
school
in
the
vampire's
lair
especially
yours
i
don't
feel
like

not
even
human

smart

get
that
i
like
how
you
talk
to
me
like
i
can
understand
things
everyone
else
is
being
all

twitchy
and
secretive
i
feel
safe
with
you
i
i
mean
you
have
that
whole

superpower
thing
and

you're
just
as
tough
as
buffy

maybe
tougher
buffy

so
too
well
she's
always
worried
about
what
she's
gonna
do
if
you
ever
get
that
chip
out
of
your
head
and
did
you
let
him
live

this
what
is
she
doing
here

it's
just
he's
got
cool
hair
and
he
wears
cool
leather
coats
and
stuff
and
he
doesn't
treat
me
like
an
alien
