gotcha
satisfied
okay
i
didn't
mean
'satisfied'
like
'cause
we're
not
having
satisfaction
in
the
personal
sense
i
should
go
giles
is
thanks
for
the
workout
right
birthday
um
actually
i
i
do
have
a
thing
nice
attempt
at
casual
actually
i
do
have
a
date
older
man
very
handsome
he
likes
it
when
i
call
him
'daddy'
he's
taking
me
to
the
ice
show
which
should
be
big
fun
i
could
use
a
little
fun
amethyst
breath
mints
okay
so
how
do
you
know
if
one's
aura's
dirty
somebody
come
by
with
a
finger
and
write
'wash
me'
on
it
sorry
it's
just
with
faith
on
one
of
her
unannounced
walkabouts
i
feel
like
somebody
should
be
patrolling
i
hate
being
the
good
one
i
guess
it
i
just
have
some
energy
to
burn
wow
that
was
really
funnylooking
could
you
do
it
again
for
that
what
were
you
trying
to
kill
me
for
before
okay
so
here's
the
deal
giles
something's
wrong
on
top
of
that
i
got
a
bad
case
of
the
dizzies
last
night
and
almost
let
a
vamp
stake
me
with
my
own
stake
i'm
way
off
my
game
my
game's
left
the
country
it's
in
cuernavaca
giles
what's
going
on
here
no
no
not
sick
i
can't
get
sick
my
dad's
coming
to
take
me
to
the
ice
show
we
do
it
every
year
for
my
birthday
if
i
cancel
it's
gonna
break
his
heart
no
no
i
just
need
to
spend
a
little
more
time
training
i'm
gone
look
i
know
you
guys
think
it's
just
a
big
dumb
girlie
thing
but
it's
not
i
mean
a
lot
of
those
skaters
are
olympic
medal
winners
and
every
year
my
dad
buys
me
cotton
candy
and
one
of
those
souvenir
programs
that
has
all
the
pictures
and
okay
it's
a
big
dumb
girlie
thing
but
i
love
it
i
dunno
i
think
it
might
be
time
to
put
a
moratorium
on
parties
in
my
honor
they
tend
to
go
badly
monsters
crash
people
die
i
think
i'll
choose
to
celebrate
this
one
with
quiet
reflection
present
ooo
present
no
no
that's
not
necessary
ii
was
just
thinking
it
might
be
nice
to
have
a
quiet
birthday
you
know
it's
not
just
cartoon
characters
they
do
pieces
from
operas
and
ballets
brian
boitano
doing
carmen
is
a
life
changer
oh
he
doesn't
actually
play
carmen
but
a
lot
of
sophisticated
people
go
you
know
it's
usually
something
that
families
do
together
iif
someone
were
free
they'd
take
their
daughters
or
their
student
or
their
slayer
oh
i'm
sorry
did
i
zone
out
on
you
it's
just
i'm
nursing
that
flu
bug
call
it
a
night
yeah
that's
a
good
idea
thanks
so
how's
it
going
with
amy
the
rat
ii
meant
how's
it
going
changing
her
back
into
a
human
being
oh
i
beg
to
differ
okay
i
just
got
swatted
down
by
some
noneck
and
rescued
by
cordelia
what
the
hell
is
happening
you're
not
getting
the
big
picture
here
ii
have
no
strength
i
have
no
coordination
i
throw
knives
like
like
i'm
not
the
slayer
promise
me
guys

okay
if
i
don't
get
my
powers
back

don't
i'll
deal
and
there's
a
whole
lotta
good
sides
to
it
giles
did
you
find
anything
thank

that's
beautiful
of
course
i
do
it's
sweet
and
thoughtful
and
full
of
neat
words
to
learn
and
say
like
'wilt'
and
'henceforth'
i'm
sorry
uh
it's
just
suddenly
there's
this
chance
that
my
calling's
a
wrong
number
and
it's
just
freaking
me
out
a
little
angel
what
if
i
have
lost
my
power
i
guess
but
what
if
i
can't
i've
seen
too
much
i
know
what
goes
bump
in
the
night
not
being
able
to
fight
it
what
if
i
just
hide
under
my
bed
all
scared
and
helpless
or
what
if
i
just
become
pathetic
hanging
out
at
the
old
slayer's
home
talking
people's
ears
off
about
my
glory
days
showing
them
mr
pointy
the
stake

had
bronzed

certain
person
who
will
remain
nameless

like
a
classical
philosopher

i'm
not
the
slayer

i
have
to
