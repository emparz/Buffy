uhh
right
in
the
heart
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
word
no
i
i
wasn't
trying
to
of
course
is
waiting
for
you
i
know
um
am
i
gonna
see
you
this
weekend
you
uh
youyou
probably
have
plans
oh
a
thing
a
date
huh
your
father
it
is
your
father
right
you
really
like
it
then
why'd
you
seem
more
excited
last
year
when
you
got
a
severed
arm
in
a
box
that's
understandable
you
lived
a
long
time
without
it
you
can
do
it
again
buffy
you
could
never
be
helpless
or
boring
not
even
if
you
tried
i
saw
you
before
you
became
the
slayer
i
watched
you
and
i
saw
you
called
it
was
a
bright
afternoon
out
in
front
of
your
school
you
walked
down
the
steps
and
and
i
loved
you
'cause
i
could
see
your
heart
you
held
it
before
you
for
everyone
to
see
and
i
worried
that
it
would
be
bruised
or
torn
and
more
than
anything
in
my
life
i
wanted
to
keep
it
safe
to
warm
it
with
my
own
i
was
just
thinking
that
too
