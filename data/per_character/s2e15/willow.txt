those
gold

well

i
don't
want
to

the
only

without
a
real

an
idiot
i'm
sorry
ii

800i'mdatingaskankyho
really
thanks
i've

a
'meow'
before
darn
tootin'
i'm
just
saying
xander
and
cordelia
i
mean
what
does
he
see
in
her
anyway
you
mean
like
bunnies
and
stuff
no
don't
tell
me
yeah
what
about
tonight's
full
moon
well
last
night
was
the
night
before
the
full
moon
traditionally
known
as
'the
night
before
the
full
moon'
giles
meaning
the
accepted
legend
that
werewolves
only
prowl
during
a
full
moon
might
be
erroneous
don't
forget
you're
supposed
to
be
a
meek
little
girliegirl
like
the
rest
of
us
i
sometimes
feel
like
that
his
'do
i
smell
something'
look
he's
so
busy
looking
around
at
everything
he
doesn't
have
he
doesn't
even
realize
what
he
does
have
mm
i'm
not
sure
i
do
oz
and
i
are
in
some
sort
of
holding
pattern
except
without
the
holding
or
anything
else
yeah
him
and
xander
guys
a
couple
of
guys
the
werewolf
it's
in
there
no
we're
fine
the
way
werewolves
always
do
on
account
of
once
you
were
a
hyena
are
you
okay
you
kind
of
knew
theresa
it
is
but
we
can
do
stuff
to
help
sometimes
it
feels
good
to
help
well
like
looking
up
stuff
i'm
gonna
be
doing
that
most
of
the
night
you
could
help
me
help
together
oh
so
there
is
one
name
that
keeps
getting
spit
out
aggressive
behavior
runins
with
authorities
about
a
screenful
of
violent
incidents
they
say
it's
a
good
idea
to
count
to
ten
when
you're
angry
i'll
keep
looking
yeah
oz
wanted
to
be
someplace
that
was
i
can't
figure
him
out
i
mean
he's
so
hot
and
cold
or
lukewarm
and
cold
it
doesn't
seem
like
a
fair
trade
well
that
won't
make
me
a
slut
it
used
to
be
so
much
easier
to
tell
if
a
boy
liked
you
he'd
punch
you
on
the
arm
and
then
run
back
to
his
friends
i'll
see
you
guys
later
cordelia
asked
me
to
look
over
her
history
homework
before
class
i
think
that
means
i
might
have
to
do
it
i
had
this
whole
thing
worked
out
and
i
had
it
written
down
uh
but
then
it
didn't
make
any
sense
when
i
was
reading
it
back
i
mean
what
am
i
supposed
to
think
first
you
buy
me
popcorn
and
then
you're
all
glad
that
i
didn't
get
bit
and
you
put
the
tag
back
in
my
shirt
but
i
guess
none
of
that
means
anything
because
instead
of
looking
up
names
with
me
here
you
are
all
alone
in
your
house
doing
nothing
by
yourself
no
damn
it
we'll
talk
about
this
now
buffy
told
me
that
sometimes
what
a
girl
makes
has
to
be
the
first
move
and
now
that
i'm
saying
this
i'm
starting
to
think
that
the
written
version
sounded
pretty
good
but
you
know
what
i
mean
well
welcome
to
the
world
things
happen
don't
you
think
i'm
going
through
a
lot
oh
what
so
now
you're
special
you're
special
boy
with
chains
and
stuff
why
do
you
have
chains
and
stuff
oz
oz
what
is
it
what's
wrong
it's
oz
it's
oz
the
werewolf
can't
you
just
trust
me
on
this
hehe
said
he
was
going
through
all
these
changes
then
he
went
through
all
these
in
the
woods
go
where
you're
not
gonna
kill
oz
yeah
he's
a
werewolf
but
he
doesn't
mean
to
be
careful
i
shot
oz
you
think
it'll
be
okay
hey
did
you
want
to
go
first
i'm
sorry
about
how
all
this
ended
up
with
me
shooting
you
and
all
it's
okay
i
kind
of
thought
you
would
have
told
me
yeah
it's
a
complication
what
i
don't
know
i'm
kind
of
okay
with
you
being
in
my
way
well
i
like
you
you're
nice
and
you're
funny
and
you
don't
smoke
yeah
okay
werewolf
but
that's
not
all
the
time
i
mean
three
days
out
of
the
month
i'm
not
much
fun
to
be
around
either
so
i'd
still
if
you'd
still
okay
no
biting
though
