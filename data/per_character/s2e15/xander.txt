but
what
could
she
possibly
see
in
him
i
just
don't
trust
oz
with
her
i
mean
he's
a
senior
he's
attractive

okay
maybe
not
to
me
but

and
he's
in
a
band
and
we
know
what
kind
of
element
that
attracts
thank
you
i'm
not
running
away
i
do
not
babble
i
occasionally
runon
every
now
and
then
i
yammer
yeah
did
you
hear
that
i
thought
i
heard
something
huh
okay
now
i
know
i
heard
something
get
us
outta
here
we
should
be
moving
let's
go
told
ya
i
heard
something
well
let's
see
um
six
feet
tall
claws
a
big
old
snout
in
the
middle
of
his
face
like
a
wolf
um
yeah
i'm
sticking
with
my
first
guess
oh
oh
and
then
there
was
that
little
thing
where
it
tried
to
bite
us
i
know
unless
the
werewolf
was
using
last
year's
almanac
would
you
look
at
that
he's
all
over
her
psst
hey
buddy
this
is
a
public
forum
here
what
happened
and
yet
ironically
uh
led
to
the
invention
of
the
moon
pie
quite
the
party
animal
on
behalf
of
my
gender
hey
so
then
i'm
guessing
your
standard
silver
bullets
are
in
order
here
but
while
we
hang
here
doing
nothing
there's
a
human
werewolf
walking
around
out
there
probably
making
fun
of
us
oh
sure
there
is
giles
knows
stuff
and
i'm
practically
an
expert
on
the
subject
i
know
what
it's
like
to
crave
the
taste
of
freshly
killed
meat
to
be
taken
over
by
those
uncontrollable
urges
i
said
i
didn't
remember
anything
about
that
look
the
point
is
is
i
have
an
affinity
with
this
thing
i
can
get
inside
of
its
head
i'm
a
big
bad
wolf
i'm
on
the
prowl
i'm
sniffing
i'm
snarling
i'm
a
slobbering
predator
i'm
wait
a
second
it's
right
in
front
of
us
it's
obvious
who
i
am
i'm
larry
the
guy's
practically
got
wolfboy
stamped
on
his
forehead
you
got
the
dog
bite
you
got
the
aggression
not
to
mention
the
excessive
back
hair
i'm
gonna
go
talk
to
him
gonna
force
a
confession
out
of
him
why
so
jumpy
larry
is
that
really
it
or
is
there
something
you're
hiding
i
know
your
secret
big
guy
i
know
what
you've
been
doing
at
night
hurting
me
isn't
gonna
make
this
go
away
people
are
still
gonna
find
out
i
don't
want
anything
i
just
wanna
help
no
it's
just
i
know
what
you're
going
through
because
i've
been
there
that's
why
i
know
you
should
talk
about
it
larry
please
before
someone
else
gets
hurt
i
heard
you
the
first
time
it
probably
would
have
slipped
out
even
if
i
wasn't
here
the
same
thing
larry
no
i
am
not
hey
wow
those
two
gals
are
hanging
out
a
lot
together
this
would
be
a
good
time
to
panic
what's
that
supposed
to
mean
he's
not
the
werewolf
can't
we
just
leave
it
at
that
must
you
continue
to
push
and
push
well
he's
not
okay
you're
not
boned
you're
buffy
eradicator
of
evil
defender
of
um
things
that
need
defending
werewolf
what
else
should
we
have
assumed
so
that's
good
right
i
mean
in
the
sense
of
the
werewolf
didn't
get
her
and
no
there
is
no
good
here
buffy
you
can't
blame
yourself
for
every
death
that
happens
in
sunnydale
if
it
weren't
for
you
people'd
be
lined
up
five
deep
waitin'
to
get
themselves
buried
willow
would
be
robbie
the
robot's
love
slave
i
wouldn't
even
have
a
head
and
theresa's
a
vampire
are
you
okay
don't
let
him
get
to
you
he's
not
the
same
guy
you
knew
oh
no
my
life's
not
too
complicated
this
is
all
so
weird
i
mean
how
are
we
supposed
to
act
when
we
see
him
all
i
know
is
i'll
never
be
able
to
look
at
him
the
same
again
who
are
we
talking
about
no
one
it's
really
nothing
we
should
be
talking
about
what
it's
not
okay
for
one
guy
to
like
another
guy
just
because
he
happened
to
be
in
the
locker
room
with
him
when
absolutely
nothing
happened
and
i
thought
i
told
you
not
to
push
oh
oh
yeah
that's
that's
the
weirdness
i've
heard
that
what
relationship
i
mean
what
life
could
they
possibly
have
together
we're
talking
obedience
school
paper
training
oz
is
always
in
back
burying
their
things
and
that
kind
of
breed
can
turn
on
its
owner
all
i'm
saying
is
she's
not
safe
with
him
if
it
were
up
to
me
