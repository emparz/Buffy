excuse
me
we
didn't
come
here
to
talk
about
willow
we
came
here
to
do
things
i
can
never
tell
my
father
about
because
he
still
thinks
i'm
a
good
girl
i've
dated
lots
of
guys
in
bands
do
you
even
wanna
be
here
because
when
you're
not
babbling
about
poor
defenseless
willow
you
are
raving
about
the
allpowerful
buffy
xander
look
around
we're
in
my
daddy's
car
it's
just
the
two
of
us
there
is
a
beautiful
big
full
moon
outside
tonight
it
doesn't
get
more
romantic
than
this
so
shut
up
what
is
it
now
iis
willow
sending
out
some
sorta
distress
signal
that
only
you
can
hear
alright
that's
it
you
know
your
mind
hasn't
been
here
all
night
how
about
i
just
drop
you
off
where
are
the
keys
oh
i
got
'em
got
'em
it
was
so
awful
daddy
just
had
this
car
detailed
or
it
could
be
a
crock
i
think
you
splashed
on
just
a
little
too
much
'obsession
for
dorks'
i
mean
with
xander
it's
always
'buffy
did
this'
'willow
said
that'
buffy
buffy
willow
willow
it's
like
i
don't
even
exist
and
then
when
i
call
him
on
it
he
acts
all
confused
like
i'm
the
one
with
the
problem
all
a
part
of
his
little
guy
games
it's
like
he's
there
but
then
he's
not
there
and
he
wants
it
but
then
he
doesn't
want
it
well
he
should
at
least
realize
that
you
have
oz
what's
he
waiting
for
what's
his
problem
who
do
they
think
they
are
