poor
technique
prioritizing
sub
par
execution
was
adequate
but
a
bit
too
bloody
for
my
taste
i'm
not
saying
that
your
methods
are
without
merit
it's
uh
y
you're
spending
too
much
time
and
energy
it
should
simply
be
plunge
and
move
on
plunge
and
hello
i
don't
know
yes
well
i
i
thought
this
vampire
was
just
on
a
random
kill
but
it
may
be
something
else
yes
i'd
best
consult
my
books
that
symbol
on
the
ring
i
believe
it's
the
rune
for
fidelity
but
uh
it
doesn't
connect
with
any
of
the
sects
that
i've
studied
let
me
see
no
ii
don't
think
this
um
represents
any
oh
the
order
of
aurelius
yes
you're
right
what
do
you
want
oh
i
was
beginning
to
suspect
that
was
a
myth
poetry
this
one
she
doesn't
love
oh
emily
dickinson
yes
uh
she's
quite
a
good
poet
i
mean
for
a
for
an
american
the
order
of
aurelius
is
a
very
old
and
venerated
sect
if
they're
here
it's
for
a
good
reason
yes
i
remember
buffy
while
the
mere
fact
of
you
wanting
to
check
out
a
book
would
be
grounds
for
a
national
holiday
i
think
we
should
focus
on
the
problem
at
hand
i'm
afraid
it's
very
big
what
are
you
talking
about
yes
well
i'm
talking
about
trouble
a
violent
and
disturbing
prophecy
is
about
to
be
fulfilled
you
were
spot
on
about
the
connection
well
ii
don't
know
exactly
aaaa
warrior
but
but
it
says
he
will
rise
from
the
ashes
of
the
five
on
the
evening
of
the
thousandth
day
after
the
advent
of
septus
which
is
tonight
my
calculations
are
precise
alright
ii'll
just
jump
in
my
time
machine
go
back
to
the
twelfth
century
and
ask
the
vampires
to
postpone
their
ancient
prophecy
for
a
few
days
while
you
take
in
dinner
and
a
show
buffy
this
is
no
ordinary
vampire
but
we
have
to
stop
him
before
he
reaches
the
master
those
will
just
have
to
be
put
on
hold
the
dark
forces
are
aligning
against
us
and
we
have
a
chance
to
beat
them
back
tonight
we
go
into
battle
perhaps
i
miscalculated
well
you
know
what
they
say
90
of
the
vampire
slaying
game
is
is
waiting
well
we
we've
certainly
waited
here
long
enough
apparently
no
one
tonight
oh
very
well
then
follow
your
hormones
if
you
want
but
i
assume
i
don't
have
to
warn
you
about
the
hazards
of
becoming
personally
involved
with
someone
whose
unaware
of
your
unique
condition
if
your
identity
as
the
slayer
is
revealed
it
could
put
you
and
all
those
around
you
in
grave
danger
'five
shall
die
and
from
their
ashes
the
anointed
shall
rise'
i
was
sure
it
was
tonight
uh
alright
well
yes
there
are
a
few
interpretations
she
is
the
strangest
girl
we
need
to
talk
my
calculations
may
not
have
been
as
far
off
as
i
thought
out
of
the
ashes
of
five
shall
rise
the
one
that's
the
prophecy
five
people
have
died
i
know
it
doesn't
quite
follow
but
but
it's
worth
investigating
look
among
the
dead
was
andrew
borba
whom
the
police
sought
for
questioning
in
a
double
murder
now
he
may
be
the
anointed
one
the
the
bodies
have
been
taken
to
to
sunnydale
funeral
home
wwe
can
i
beg
your
pardon
you
have
a
date
wait
you're
not
getting
off
that
easily
another
date
don't
you
ever
do
anything
else
no
we
don't
true
buffy
maintaining
a
normal
social
life
as
a
slayer
iiis
problematic
at
best
well
i
i
suppose
it
was
a
fairly
slim
lead
yes
and
uh
you'll
face
a
pretty
hefty
fine
in
the
morning
oh
uh
probably
not
no
i
uh
i
suppose
i'll
just
uh
go
to
the
funeral
home
in
case
just
see
if
anything
comes
up
damn
ah
what
are
you
doing
here
they
are
uh
listen
you
should
get
to
safety
i'm
afraid
not
uh
she
has
her
her
beeping
thing
um
no
phone
of
course
do
hurry
it
is
you
oh
good
uh
two
more
of
the
brethren
came
in
here
they
came
after
me
but
i
was
more
than
a
match
for
them
i
hid
uh
this
uh
chap
was
good
enough
to
bunk
with
me
till
they
went
away
ah
well
that's
what
we
have
to
find
out
i
don't
know
what
these
brethren
mean
to
do
exactly
find
the
anointed
or
or
or
or
give
him
something
perhaps
uh
it's
all
all
very
vague
and
the
anointed
may
be
long
gone
we
must
find
out
owen
you
brought
a
date
buffy
when
i
said
you
could
slay
vampires
and
have
a
social
life
i
didn't
mean
at
the
same
time
yyou
can't
make
him
go
out
there
alone
we
don't
know
where
the
brethren
are
ii'll
just
keep
looking
he
must
be
here
somewhere
the
anointed
must
be
gone
mmhm
what
oh
uh
wwhat
should
i
do
buffy
buffy
if
i
might
uh
i
was
ten
years
old
when
my
father
told
me
i
was
destined
to
be
a
watcher
he
was
one
and
his
uh
mother
before
him
and
i
was
to
be
next
no
i
had
very
definite
plans
about
my
future
i
was
going
to
be
a
fighter
pilot
or
possibly
a
grocer
well
uh
my
father
gave
me
a
very
tiresome
speech
about
uh
responsibility
and
sacrifice
seems
like
a
nice
lad
i
i
went
to
the
funeral
home
of
my
own
free
will
buffy
i
have
volumes
of
lore
of
prophecies
of
predictions
but
i
don't
have
an
instruction
manual
we
feel
our
way
as
we
go
along
and
i
must
say
as
a
slayer
you're
you're
doing
pretty
well
you
did
handily
no
more
anointed
one
and
i
would
imagine
the
master
wherever
he
is
is
having
a
fairly
bad
day
himself
