lost
my
emily
dickinson

dumb
but
i
like
her
around
kind
of
a
security
blanket
dickinson
i
didn't
think
i'd
find
you
here
i
i
didn't
mean
i
mean
i
think
you
can
read
but
you
don't
seem
bookwormy
the
type
of
person
to
lock
themselves
in
a
dark
room
with
a
lotta
musty
old
books
oh
and
i've
offended
you
you
shouldn't
be
what's
this
i'll
uh
see
you
in
math
if
i
open
my
eyes
at
some
point
let
me
get
that
at
least
you
don't
have
to
eat
your
soylent
green

about
you
how
'bout

again
for
tonight
i'll
even
lend
you
my
watch

could
invite
the
chess
club

they
drink
and
they
start
fights
i
danced
with
her
a
couple
of
times
great
i'll
pick
you
up
at
seven

when
the
little
hand's
there

really
care
about
your
work
what
she
doesn't
like
to
dance
is
everything
cool
the
thing
about
emily
dickinson
i
love
is
is
she's
just
so
incredibly
morbid
a
lot
of
loss
a
lot
of
death
it
gets
me
with
a
lot
about
bees
for
some
reason
quiet
kind
of
sequestered
and
uneventful
which
i
can
really
relate
to
i
don't
get
out
much
it's
my
fault
i
just
find
most
girls
pretty
frivolous
i
mean
there's
a
lot
more
important
things
in
life
than
dating
y'know
oh
did
i
say
something
wrong
it's
weird
you
one
minute
you're
right
