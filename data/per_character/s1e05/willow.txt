owen
thurman
was
talking
to
you
wow
he
hardly
talks
to
anyone
he's
solitary
mysterious
he
can
brood
for
forty
minutes
straight
i've
clocked
him
what
did
you
guys
have
to
talk
about
he
reads
emily
dickinson
he's
sensitive
yet
manly
well
wait
you've
never
even
read
her
you
vixen
that's
bad
mm
just
to
be
polite
good
luck
it's
a
very
big
deal
it
is
tell
her
thank
you
what
are
you
talking
about
who's
that
buffy
has
a
really
important
date
pick
here
put
this
on
so
where's
he
taking
you
well
i
read
somewhere
once
that
sometimes
they
go
to
movies
and
i
saw
on
tv
once
a
bunch
of
people
our
age
went
to
a
party
uh
owen
xander
is
something
going
on
this
is
bad
we
should
go
along
xander
we
should
go
with
giles
he
could
get
in
trouble
giles
it's
us
can
you
get
out
this
window
buffy
oh
yeah
well
we
knew
it
would
happen
eventually
so
we
figured
hey
why
fight
it
i've
always
wanted
to
go
there
the
room's
around
back
oh
she
just
wants
to
make
sure
there're
no
guards
so
we
don't
get
in
trouble
is
everything
okay
uh
just
in
case
i
think
he's
coming
this
way
owen
buffy
owen's
oh
you
mean
specifically
about
you
but
he
was
pretty
incoherent
so
we
might've
missed
it
well
heh
this
is
our
stop
