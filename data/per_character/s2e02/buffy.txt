of
us
have
a
ton
of
trig
homework
waiting
are
you
crazy
you
don't
just
sneak
up
on
people
in
a
graveyard
you
make
noise
when

walk
you
stomp
or
yodel
i'm
supposed
to
be
but
lazy
bones

it's
weird
to
think
of
you
going
through
that
yeah
why
xander
nope
why
are
you
jealous
is
it
'cause
i
danced
with
him
don't
you
think
you're
being
a
little
unfair
it
was
one
little
dance
which
i
only
did
to
make
you
crazy
by
the
way
behold
my
success
you're
not
jealous
what
vampires
don't
get
jealous
well
i
didn't
come
here
to
fight
oh
right
i
did
where's
my
stake
ii
know
i
had
a
stake
what
do

he's
just
a
kid
does
that
mean
i'm
just
a
kid
too
oh
no
you
don't
you
can't
just
turn
and
walk
away
from
me
like
that
it
takes
more
than
that
to
get
rid
of
me
oof
uhhh
i'm
fine
gee
i
wish
people
wouldn't
leave
open
graves
lying
around
like
this
i
don't
think
so
look
at
those
tracks
whoever
was
buried
here
didn't
rise
from
this
grave
she
was
dragged
from
it
boy
i
guess
we
never
realized
how
much
you
like
that
chair
your
pickup
lines
then
if
you
wouldn't
mind
a
little
gene
and
roger
you
might
wanna
leave
off
the
'idiot'
part
being
called
an
idiot
tends
to
take
people
out
of
the
dating
mood
i
fear
you
you
also
might
wanna
avoid
words
like
'amenable'
and
'indecorous'
y'know
speak
english
not
whatever
they
speak
in
um
yeah
you
just
say
'hey
i
got
a
thing
you
maybe
have
a
thing
maybe
we
could
have
a
thing'
giles
oh
thank
you
cyrano
i'm
not
finished
then
you
say
'how
do
you
feel
about
mexican'
giles
about
mexicans
mexican
food
you
take
her
for
food
for
which
you
then
pay
and
she's
the
only
woman
we've
actually
ever
seen
speak
to
you
add
it
all
up
and
it
all
spells
'duh'
more
or
less
angel
and
i
took
care
of
him
there's
something
else
though
we
found
an
empty
grave
no
no
this
one
was
dug
up
and
the
body
was
taken
out
i
know
you
meant
to
say
gross
and
disturbing
meredith
todd
ring
a
bell
she
died
recently
she
was
our
age
comin'
through
sorry
uh
sorry
to
interrupt
willow
but
it's
the
bat
signal
how
was
her
neck
you
know
what
this
means
she
wasn't
killed
by
vampires
somebody
did
dig
up
her
corpse
so
we
should
see
if
the
other
girls
from
the
accident
are
awol
too
maybe
we
can
figure
out
what
this
creep
has
in
mind
if
we
know
whether
or
not
he's
dealing
in
volume
i
don't
think
so
angel
and
i
have
been
um
never
mind
as
far
as
angel's
concerned
i'm
taking
the
night
off
okay
i
couldn't
believe
angel
he
was
acting
all
jealous
and
he
wouldn't
even
admit
it
of
xander
am
i
ever
gonna
live
that
down
anyway
he
was
being
totally
irrational
that's
the
truth
sorry
but
i'm
an
oldfashioned
gal
i
was
raised
to
believe
that
men
dig
up
the
corpses
and
the
women
have
the
babies
so
speaking
of
the
wacky
what
was
cordelia's
whole
riff
about
painful
memories
who's
daryl
was
he
studly
and
he
broke
cordy's
heart
thus
possibly
proving
its
existence
man
that's
lousy
poor
chris
pathetic
much
move
over
zombie
drill
team
then
angel
i
i
was
um
but
something
came
up
we
were
investigating
somebody's
been
digging
up
the
bodies
of
dead
girls
you
mean
like
two
of
the
three
i
don't
get
it
why
go
to
all
the
trouble
to
dig
up
three
girls
only
to
chop
them
up
and
throw
them
away
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
especially
from
a
time
management
standpoint
could
this
get
yuckier
question
answered
maybe
because
whoever
did
it
had
some
business
in
the
neighborhood
like
say
classes
willow
why
don't
you
get
these
guys'
locker
numbers
so
we
can
do
some
checking
fine
your
butt's
covered
wanna
grab
a
locker
okay
eric
let's
see
what's
on
your
annoying
little
mind
yes
we
do
not
yet
i
don't
get
it
why
would
anybody
wanna
make
a
girl
love
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
uh
eric's
sick
enough
to
do
something
like
this
but
what
about
chris
he
seems
like
a
human
person
but
it's
not
doable
i
mean
making
someone
from
scraps
actually
making
them
live
hey
still
no
sign
of
our
mad
doctors
okay
giles
just
remember
'i
feel
a
thing
you
feel
a
thing'
but
personalize
it
she's
a
technopagan
right
ask
her
to
bless
your
laptop
have
fun
well
it's
official
chris
and
eric
didn't
come
to
school
today
god
what
if
it
worked
what
what
if
that
poor
girl
is
walking
around
what
could
she
be
thinking
they
only
had
three
girls
how
fresh
i
think
anybody
who
cuts
dead
girls
into
little
pieces
does
not
get
the
benefit
of
any
doubt
i
wanna
end
this
thing
now
okay
