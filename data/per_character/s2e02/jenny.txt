did
you
bring
it
tomorrow
good
morning
rupert
oh
no
please
call
me
jenny
ms
hmm
yeah
rupert
look
i've
gotta
get
inside
and
set
up
the
lab
ah
i
gotta
go
sorry
hey
listen
if
it's
important
why
don't
you
just
tell
me
at
the
game
yeah
you
seem
surprised
on
game
night
are
you
nuts
you're
going
too
right
so
we
should
just
go
together
look
i
could
pick
you
up
after
school
and
we'll
grab
a
bite
to
eat
on
the
way
if
you
like
how
do
you
feel
about
mexican
good
okay
and
whatever
it
is
you
wanna
tell
me
you
can
just
tell
me
then
okay
i
don't
know
what
it
is
about
football
that
does
it
for
me
i
mean
it
lacks
the
the
grace
of
basketball
the
uh
poetry
of
baseball
at
its
best
it's
unadorned
aggression
it's
such
a
rugged
contest
and
that's
funny
because
is
this
your
normal
strategy
for
a
first
date
dissing
my
country's
national
pastime
you
noticed
that
huh
hey
guys
what's
up
it's
okay
although
a
good
rule
of
thumb
for
a
first
date
is
don't
do
anything
so
exciting
that
it'll
be
hard
to
top
on
the
second
date
you
noticed
that
huh
