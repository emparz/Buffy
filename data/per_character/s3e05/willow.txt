that
sounds
like
fun
and
it
is
our
last
homecoming
dance
so
maybe
we
should
make
a
big
deal
of
it
a
private
limo
it
it
is
pretty
cuddlesome
and
if
we
all
split
the
cost
why
wouldn't
you
go
you
already
have
your
tickets
i
mean
unless
you
don't
have
a
da
ay
oor
two
to
think
about
it
we
should
all
think
about
it
you
have
to
help
me
pick
an
outfit
i
wanna
wear
something
that
makes
oz
go
'oh'
where's
buffy
she's
gonna
miss
the
yearbook
pictures
didn't
cordelia
tell
you
what
do
you
think
of
this
it's
my
first
big
dance
you
know
where
there's
a
boy
and
a
band
and
not
just
me
alone
in
my
room
pretending
that
there's
a
boy
and
a
band
the
tux
i
thought
you
uh
borrowed
it
from
your
cousin
rigby
what
do
you
think
about
this
i
was
just
remember
the
eighthgrade
cotillion
you
had
that
clipon
that's
none
of
your
business
alexander
harris
you
don't
know
that
what
about
you
and
cordelia
oh
yeah
well
since
when
did
you
become
a
gentleman
uh
i
know
'nice'
xander
i
was
gonna
go
with
'gorgeous'
really
you
too
iin
a
guy
way
so
is
cordelia
iin
a
girl
way
i
don't
know
if
i
can
dance
in
this
i
don't
know
if
i
can
dance
yeah
this
shouldn't
be
a
problem
no
i
mean
it
did
but
it
didn't
i
would
never
either
iit
must
be
the
clothes
iit's
a
fluke
not
ever
right
now
i
didn't
me
either
but
they
were
killed
by
zombies
uh
it's
just
about
done
it's
just
that
she
needs
it
so
much
more
than
you
do
hi
how
are
you
you
good
you
look
good
anything
new
hey
did
i
mention
you
look
good
no
i'm
not
a
friend
i'm
a
rabid
dog
who
should
be
shot
but
there're
forces
at
work
here
dark
incomprehensible
forces
what
do
you
want
'kay
this
is
just
the
worst
thing
that's
ever
happened
ever
i'm
talking
about
buffy
and
cordelia
what
are
we
gonna
do
i
mean
we
have
to
do
something
because
we
felt
so
guilty
about
the
fluke
we
overcompensated
helping
cordelia
and
we
spun
the
whole
group
dynamic
out
of
orbit
and
we're
just
a
big
meteor
shower
heading
for
earth
sometimes
when
you're
falling
to
pieces
your
mouth
it
just
does
the
sweetest
thing
what
are
we
gonna
do
i'm
talking
about
us
we
did
one
fine
thing
they're
gonna
announce
the
queen
where
are
they
what's
keeping
them
