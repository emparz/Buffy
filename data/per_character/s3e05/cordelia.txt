consider
me
for
homecoming
queen
thanks
for
your
support
buffy
you
look
so
cute
in
that
outfit
then
make
it
snappy
didn't
i
oh
i
guess
i
forgot
what's
the
big
hey
i
am
under
a
lot
of
pressure
here
what
would
you
know
about
it
just
because
you
were
guacamole
queen
when
you
were
three
doesn't
mean
you
understand
how
this
works
no
it
involves
being
part
of
this
school
and
having
actual
friends
now
if
it
was
about
monsters
blood
and
innards
then
you'd
be
a
shooin
i'd
like
to
see
you
try
to
win
the
crown
what
does
that
mean
this
is
starting
to
be
sad
what
the
slayer
yeah
great
willow
how's
that
database
coming
xander
let's
get
cracking
thanks
for
what
you
said
buffy
i
think
we're
getting
along
great
don't
you
are
you
kidding
i've
been
doing
the
vulcan
death
grip
since
i
was
four
is
that
any
more
tacky
than
your
faux
'i'm
shy
but
deep'
campaign
posters
this
whole
trying
to
be
like
me
really
isn't
funny
anymore
i
don't
see
why
your
pathetic
need
to
recapture
your
glory
days
gives
you
the
right
to
splinter
my
vote
yeah
two
of
them
unlike
some
people
why
don't
you
do
us
both
a
favor
and
stay
out
of
my
way
you're
sick
you
know
that
you
crazy
freak
what
did
you
call
me
i
took
the
orchid
i
don't
see
what
the
big
deal
is
it
goes
with
my
complexion
better
what
is
this
okay
guys
we've
had
enough
of
your
stupid
little
game
hello
how
stupid
are
you
people
she's
a
slayer
i'm
a
homecoming
queen
i
have
an
idea
we
talk
to
these
people
we
explain
that
i'm
not
a
slayer
and
they
let
me
go
look
out
could
i
just
ask
you
an
eensy
favor
could
you
just
tell
your
friends
that
i'm
not
a
sl
safe
i'm
not
safe
i'm
gonna
die
i'm
never
gonna
be
crowned
homecoming
queen
i'm
never
gonna
graduate
from
high
school
i'm
never
gonna
know
if
it's
real
between
me
and
xander
or
if
it's
just
some
temporary
insanity
that
made
me
think
i
loved
him
and
now
i'm
never
gonna
get
the
chance
to
tell
him
i
know
what
you're
up
to
you
think
if
you
get
me
mad
enough
i
won't
be
so
scared
and
hey
it's
working
where's
a
damn
weapon
well
he
kinda
grows
on
you
like
a
chia
pet
just
this
and
a
telephone
no
this
is
better
for
oh
what
happened
why
is
it
every
time
i
go
somewhere
with
you
it
always
ends
in
violence
and
terror
i
don't
wanna
be
in
your
life
i
wanna
be
in
my
life
all
i
wanted
was
to
be
homecoming
