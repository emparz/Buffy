oh
hold
it
hold
it
are
you
blind
or
are
you
just
illiterate
because
hyenas
are
very
quick
to
prey
on
the
weak
you're
not
going
in
there
anyone
that
does
is
in
a
world
of
trouble
it's
a
quarantine
these
hyenas
just
came
in
from
africa
so
keep
out
even
if
they
call
your
name
the
masai
tribesmen
told
me
that
hyenas
are
capable
of
understanding
human
speech
they
follow
humans
around
by
day
learning
their
names
at
night
when
the
campfire
dies
they
call
out
to
a
person
once
they
separate
him
the
pack
devours
them
the
students
have
been
possessed
by
the
hyenas
are
you
sure
the
zoo
imported
those
hyenas
from
africa
there
was
something
strange
about
them
from
day
one
i
did
some
homework
that
particular
breed
is
very
rare
totally
vicious
historically
they
were
worshipped
by
these
guys
yeah
creepy
guys
now
they
had
rituals
for
taking
the
hyena
spirits
but
ii
don't
see
how
that
coulda
happened
to
your
kids
predatory
act
of
course
that
makes
sense
where
did
you
read
that
look
look
i
think
we
may
have
enough
information
so
that
together
we
could
pull
off
a
reverse
transpossession
we've
gotta
get
those
possessed
students
over
to
the
hyena
cage
right
away
i'll
meet
you
there
we
can
begin
the
rituals
no
i
wouldn't
worry
about
that
after
hyenas
feed
and
rest
they
will
track
the
missing
member
of
their
pack
until
they
find
him
they
should
come
right
to
you
almost
it
bothered
me
but
the
power
will
be
mine
they're
right
here
in
the
feeding
area
stay
back
they
haven't
been
fed
he's
laying
in
wait
when
the
time
is
right
i'm
gonna
need
your
help
here
a
predatory
act
remember
something
like
that
