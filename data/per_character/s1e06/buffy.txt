a
witty
just
thankful

i
missed
it

i'll
find
the
courage
to
live
on
uh
i
was
looking
at
the
fishes
it
was
fishes
well
it
would
it's
nothing
i
we
do
the
same
zoo
trip
at
my
old
school
every
year
same
old
same
old
you
know
you're
right
suddenly
the
animals
look
shiny
and
new
what
is
it
with
those
guys
yeah
well
i'd
better
extract
lance
before
you
don't
think
we
should
follow
why
don't
we
oh
wwe
were
just
gonna
take
why
is
it
offlimits
what
are
you
talking
about
hmm
that'd
make
him
on
time
we
couldn't
have
that
about
what
i
didn't
notice
anything
but
then
again
i'm
not
as
hyperaware
of
him
as
oh
say
for
example
you
well
i'm
not
constantly
monitoring
his
health
his
moods
his
blood
pressure
you
got
it
bad
girl
i
dimly
recall
not
of
late
goes
with
the
shoes
i
suppose
some
girls
might
find
him
goodlooking
if
they
have
eyes
alright
he's
a
honey
but
it's
just
he's
never
around
and
when
he
is
all
he
wants
to
do
is
talk
about
vampires
and
i
i
just
can't
have
a
relationship
angel
boy
well
it
was
my
buttery
croissant
what's
up
with
you
okay
now
what
yeah
ii
often
do
i'm
actually
known
for
it
and
the
weird
behavior
award
goes
to
oh
great
it's
the
winged
monkeys
well
that
last
roundhouse
was
kinda
sloppy
are
you
sure
you
don't
wanna
do
it
again
he's
so
cute
he
doesn't
look
mean
mr
flutie
you're
right
he's
a
fine
mascot
and
will
engender
school
spirit
yeah
you
gonna
say
something
to
me
i
think
something's
wrong
with
him
what
are
you
talking
about
you
think
this
has
something
to
do
with
me
no
that
still
doesn't
explain
why
he's
hanging
out
with
the
dode
patrol
something's
going
on
something
weird
talk
to
the
expert
on
weird
uhhuh
yes
it's
bad
isn't
it
giles
i'm
serious
i
cannot
believe
that
you
of
all
people
are
trying
to
scully
me
there
is
something
supernatural
at
work
here
get
your
books
look
stuff
up
i
don't
know
that's
your
department
he
scared
the
pig
well
he
did
what
did
you
just
say
they
prey
on
the
weak
i've
heard
that
somewhere
bef
xander
has
been
acting
totally
wiggy
ever
since
we
went
to
the
zoo
him
and
kyle
and
all
those
guys
they
went
into
the
hyena
cage
oh
god
that
laugh
i
don't
know
or
been
possessed
by
one
not
just
xander
all
of
them
the
pig
testosterone
huh
wow
apparently
noah
rejected
the
hyenas
from
the
ark
because
he
thought
they
were
an
evil
impure
mixture
of
dogs
and
cats
they
do
seem
to
be
the
schmoes
of
the
animal
kingdom
that's
assuming
'possession'
is
the
right
word
so
how
does
it
work
and
then
they
started
acting
like
hyenas
so
what
happens
to
the
person
once
the
spirit's
in
them
i
gotta
find
xander
they
are
strong
xander
this
is
ridiculous
we
need
to
talk
get
off
of
me
you're
in
trouble
xander
you
are
infected
with
some
hyena
thing
it's
like
a
demonic
possession
look
xander
i
don't
wanna
hurt
you
hurry
up
we
gotta
get
him
locked
up
somehow
before
he
comes
to
i
hit
him
a
desk
he
tried
his
hand
at
felony
sexual
assault
no
no
but
it's
safe
to
say
that
in
his
animal
state
his
idea
of
wooing
doesn't
involve
a
yanni
cd
and
a
bottle
of
chianti
there
that
oughta
hold
him
where's
giles
right
now
i'm
a
little
more
worried
about
what
the
rest
of
the
pack
are
up
to
they
didn't
hurt
him
did
they
they
ate
principal
flutie
giles
how
do
we
stop
this
how
do
you
transpossess
someone
oh
that's
great
any
volunteers
what
we
need
to
do
is
put
the
hyena
back
in
the
hyena
betcha
that
zookeeper
could
tell
us
maybe
he
didn't
quarantine
those
hyenas
because
they
were
sick
okay
oh
wait
somebody's
gotta
watch
xander
will
are
you
sure
if
he
wakes
up
c'mon
we're
really
really
sure
boys
what
do
we
do
wwell
we
can
guarantee
one
of
them
but
there
are
four
more
and
we
have
no
idea
where
they
are
willow
i
think
they're
going
no
they're
hungry
they'll
be
looking
for
somebody
weak
i'm
really
sorry
will
i
didn't
know
they
were
gonna
come
after
xander
and
before
their
next
meal
guess
that's
my
job
they're
tough
but
i
think
they're
getting
stupider
you
guys
go
to
the
zoo
and
i
will
bring
them
to
you
didn't
your
mom
teach
you
don't
play
with
your
food
c'mon
you
know
what
you
want
they're
right
behind
me
it
shouldn't
be
too
hard
to
find
a
new
principal
unless
they
ask
what
happened
to
the
last
one
oh
right
well
it
wasn't
really
you
this
is
definitely
the
superior
xander
accept
no
substitutes
nah
c'mon
we're
gonna
be
late
