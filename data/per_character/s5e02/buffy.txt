you

you
did
too
suck
up
mmhmm

the
nicest
kind
plans
we
planned
plans
right
giles

on
his
way
to
pick
me
up
slayer
shopping
actually
but
equally
as
important
are
you
mad
at
me
good
there's
a
lot
of
books
on
this
list
any
of
them
come
on
tape
you
know
read
by
george
clooney
or
someone
cute
like
that
i'm
just
kidding
hey
this
betty's
ready
color
me
committed
you
put
it
in
neutral
again
huh
giles
are
you
breaking
up
with
your
car
little
twodoor
tramp
shallow
do
i
have
to
where
are
you
guys
heading
so
giles
and
i
worked
out
a
whole
schedule
around
school
a
block
of
time
every
day
just
to
focus
on
my
new
slayer
training
oh
no
do
they
make
an
ointment
for
that
yeah
that
reminds
me
with
the
whole
new
training
schedule
i
kinda
had
to
drop
a
class
so
i
won't
be
taking
drama
with
you
well
i
know
but
giles
said
that
it
just
was
what
happened
to
people
gotta
respect
a
work
ethic
well
i
think
odd
just
got
upped
to
bad
giles
hello
anyone
here
will
it's
nothing
you
need
to
see
dawn
go
wait
outside
dawn
look
i
don't
have
time
for
this
just
do
as
i
say
and
wait
here
judging
by
the
bitefest
i'd
say
it
was
more
than
one
vampire
looks
like
someone's
put
together
a
new
fang
club
oh
shoot
was
that
the
only
copy
what
i'll
get
riley
to
help
me
patrol
oh
duty
i
gotta
drop
my
sister
back
home
my
mother's
gonna
kill
me
what'd
they
take
was
it
valuable
no
i
didn't
bring
her
to
it
it

just

sorta
came
upon
us
it's
not
like
she
saw
the
body
or
anything
no
that
is
not
what
i
meant
to
patrol
i'm
working
it's
not
like
i
wanna
go
to
the
sock
hop
wait
so
what
you're
saying
is
if
i
can
get
an
acceptable
babysitter
here
before
you
leave
i
can
go
patrol
xander
so
then
my
mom
goes
off
on
me
about
how
i'm
supposed
to
watch
out
for
dawn
and
make
sure
that
she's
shielded
from
something
that
might
upset
her
she
didn't
see
him
a
foot
maybe
a
dead
foot
which
is
bad
okay
but
hello
i
see
dead
stuff
all
the
time
and
you
don't
see
mom
shielding
me
thank
you
logic
boy
did
i
mention
this
is
a
rant
sense
really
has
no
place
in
it
oh
trash
can
from
a
distance
it
looked
kinda
riley
tense
nooo
ii
was
gonna
say
brown
squat
shadowy
yeah
there's
a
new
vampire
gang
in
town
i
guess
it's
just
i
don't
know
it

i
know
it's
always
been
this
way
she's
the
baby
but
for
some
reason
lately
it's
just
really
getting
to
me
she's
always
around
her
idol
i
don't
think
so
unless
you
like
to
spill
things
on
your
idol's
new
leather
pants
and
riley
you
know
what
i
mean
you
have
super
powers

and
college

a
studly
yet
sensitive
boyfriend
and
a
pesky
lifeordeath
job
that
i
can't
quit
or
even
take
a
break
from
and
that's
what
bugs
she
gets
to
be
a
kid
and
she
acts
like
it's
the
biggest
burden
in
the
world
sometimes
i
would
like
to
just
curl
up
in
mom's
lap
and
not
worry
about
the
fate
of
the
world
i'd
like
to
be
the
one
who's
protected
who's
waited
on
cut
to
joyce's
house
harmony

harmony
has
minions
i'm
sorry
i'm
sorry
it's
just

harmony
has
minions
i
sure
hope
so
'cause
i'm
having
trouble
breathing
what
is
it
what
you
guys
can't
invite
her
in
i
mean
only
someone
who
lives
here
can
where
is
she
dawn
oh
well
that
just
makes
it
okay
then
doesn't
it
well
that
was
before
dawn
gave
harmony
a
backstage
pass
to
kill
us
all
in
our
sleep
no
not
all
better
i
mean
it's
not
like
dawn
hasn't
grown
up
in
this
house
knowing
all
the
rules
especially
the
biggie
numero
oneoh
do
not
invite
bloodsucking
dead
people
into
our
house
i
mean
please
i
would
never
have
harmony
over
even
when
she
was
alive
well
that
was
different
i
mean
she

he
would

she
was
lonely
and
and
and
she
didn't
know
he
was
a
vampire
the
vampire
meanwhile
dawn
knew
exactly
what
harmony
was
and
she
rolled
out
the
welcome
mat
for
her
you
know
will
everybody
please
stop
saying
that
i
was
just
a
kid
when
i
met
my
first
vampire
but
somehow
i
still
managed
to
remember
the
rules
no
no
it
was
common
sense
but
nobody
expects
even
that
much
from
dawn
do
they
no
she
has
to
be
protected
and
coddled
from
the
big
bad
world
well
you
know
what
we
are
doing
nothing
but
turning
her
into
a
little
idiot
who
is
going
to
get
us
all
killed
she
just
has
to
be
more
careful
now
i
can't
be
there
to
protect
her
24
hours
a
day
ii
just
can't
dawn
whawhat
about
dawn
oh
god
oh
god
uh
take
care
of
anya
i
don't
have
time
for
banter
spike
where's
harmony's
lair
where
is
she
i
know
can't
say
she
didn't
warn
him
dawn
close
your
eyes
we've
met
harmony
you
halfwit
harmony
when
you
tried
to
be
head
cheerleader
you
were
bad
when
you
tried
to
chair
the
homecoming
committee
you
were
really
bad
but
when
you
try
to
be
bad

you
suck
you
are
going
to
be
in
so
much
trouble
when
we
get
home
fine
i'll
just
tell
her
that
you
ran
out
of
the
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
that
you
got
anya
hurt
invited
a
vampire
in
got
kidnapped
yeah
yeah
you
know

i
got
the
vamps
and
we
watched
some
tv
so
how
was
the
exhibit
giles
are
you
sure
about
this
well
aside
from
the
fact
that
most
magic
shop
owners
in
sunnydale
have
the
life
expectancy
of
a
spinal
tap
drummer

and
have
you
ever
run
a
store
before
boy
you've
really
thought
this
through
how
bored
were
you
last
year
don't
break
anything
just
don't
touch
anything
what
you're
doing
right
now
not
moving
good
keep
doing
that
