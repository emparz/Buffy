be
ready
for
you
stakes

crosses

the
whole
enchilada
buffy
is
not
going
to
be
happy
about
this
yeah
that
was
pretty
much
my
reaction
and
ruffles
have
ridges
uh
buffy
there's
actually
a
more
serious
side
to
all
this
well
she
did
come
here
to
kill
you
uh
yeah
actually
she

harmony

kind
of
happened
to
sort
of
get
an
invite
buff
it
was
an
accident
she
didn't
mean
it
no
but
believe
me
nobody
feels
worse
than
her
right
now
buff
i
left
word
with
willow
she'll
come
do
a
return
engagement
of
her
uninvitation
spell
she
probably
still
has
the
stuff
from
last
week
and
bang
boom
you're
back
in
the
fortress
of
solitude
all
better
people
slip

invited
