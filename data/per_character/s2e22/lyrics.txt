the
winter
here
is
cold
and
bitter

it's
chilled
us
to
the
bone

we
haven't
seen
the
sun
for
weeks

too
long
too
far
from
home
she
looks
at
the
neighboring
houses
then
back
at
hers
cut
into
the
house
joyce
climbs
the
steps
and
looks
down
the
hall
at
buffy's
door
i
feel
just
like
i'm
sinking
joyce
buffy
and
i
claw
for
solid
ground
she
walks
to
buffy's
room
and
looks
in
the
windows
are
open
and
some
of
her
daughter's
things
are
strewn
on
the
bed
she
steps
in
and
looks
around
i'm
pulled
down
by
the
undertow
she
sees
a
note
on
the
bed
among
a
bunch
of
clothes
i
never
thought
i
could
feel
so
low
she
picks
up
the
note
and
reads
and
oh
darkness

i
feel
like
letting
go
she
begins
to
cry
as
she
reads
and
sits
down
on
the
bed
if
all
of
the
strength
and
all
of
the
courage

come
and
lift
me
from
this
place
cut
to
sunnydale
high
school
xander
and
giles
walk
up
to
oz
pushing
willow
in
a
wheelchair
with
cordelia
at
their
side
giles'
walk
is
a
bit
unsteady
i
know
i
can
love
you
much
better
than
this

full
of
grace
giles
willow
are
you
sure
you
should
be
out
of
bed
where
everything
we
said
and
did

hurts
us
all
the
more
they
all
turn
and
head
into
the
school
it's
just
that
we
stayed
too
long

in
the
same
old
sickly
skin
cut
to
buffy
looking
at
the
school
from
behind
a
tree
she
watches
them
as
they
go
in
i'm
pulled
down
by
the
undertow

i
never
thought
i
could
feel
so
low
the
camera
pans
around
her
to
her
face
looking
sadly
at
the
school
a
light
breeze
sweeps
her
hair
back
and
oh
darkness

i
feel
like
letting
go
she
turns
around
and
walks
away
down
the
street
without
looking
back
if
all
of
the
strength
and
all
of
the
courage

come
and
lift
me
from
this
place
dissolve
to
the
inside
of
a
bus
buffy's
reflection
is
visible
in
the
window
as
it
drives
by
her
house
i
know
i
can
love
you
much
better
than
this

full
of
grace
buffy
looks
out
the
window
calmly
as
the
bus
drives
on
i
know
i
can
love
you
much
better
than
this
the
camera
pans
down
to
a
sign
that
reads
now
leaving
sunnydale
come
back
soon
it's
better
this
wa
