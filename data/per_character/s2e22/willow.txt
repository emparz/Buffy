good
but
i'm
awake
and
i
know
my
name
and
who's
president
and
how
many
fingers
so
they
don't
think
my
brain
got
mushed
at
all
i
know
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
get
to
cure
angel
i
guess
any
luck
finding
giles
what
i
wanna
try
again
the
curse
we
never
got
to
finish
it
maybe
we
can
restore
angel's
soul
i'm
okay
there's
no
use
arguing
with
me
do
you
see
my
resolve
face
you've
seen
it
before
you
know
what
it
means
this
can
help
buffy
if
we
turn
angel
back
soon
enough
we
can
stop
him
from
ever
awakening
acathla
go
with
cordy
to
the
library
and
get
my
things
she'll
fill
you
in
xander
go
to
buffy
tell
her
what
we're
doing
maybe
she
can
stall
resolve
face
are
we
ready
yyou
don't
have
to
understand
it
you
just
have
to
say
it
i
hope
not
dead
nor
not
of
the
living
spirits
of
the
interregnum
i
call
gods
bind
him
cast
his
heart
from
the
evil
realm
return
i
call
on
te
implor
doamne
nu
ignora
aceasta
rugaminte
nici
mort
nici
al
fiintei
lasa
orbita
sa
fie
vasul
carei
va
transporta
sufletul
la
el
asa
sa
fie
asa
sa
fie
acum
acum
look
who's
talking
no
i
think
the
spell
worked
i
felt
something
go
through
me
or
maybe
angel
was
saved
and
they
want
to
be
alone
together
yeah
she'll
be
here
in
a
while
