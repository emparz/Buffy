another

and
surveying

buffy
slowly
gets
to
her
feet
and
raises
her

nods
toward
the

lying

starts
to
go
to
him
but

grabs
her
and
pushes
her
back
the

officer
hands
her
off
to

angrily

buffy
glances
over
her
shoulder
and
without

punches
the
officer
in
the
face
he
grunts
in
pain
and
stumbles
backward
into
the
lockers
she
grabs
him
by
the
neck
and
pushes
his
head
down
flipping
him
over
onto
his
back
snyder
takes
a
shocked
step
back
he
is
too
stunned
by
what
he
just
saw
her
do
to
move
and
just
lets
her
run
down
the
hall
without
even
looking
officer2
comes
out
of
the
library
and
sees
her
partner
on
the
floor
and
buffy
running
away
she
raises
her
gun
and
takes
aim
at
buffy
now
snyder
turns
around
to
see
buffy
running
away
but
he's
still
too
shook
up
to
have
the
sense
to
get
out
of
the
officer's
way
buffy
looks
back
and
turns
down
an
adjacent
hall
and
the
officer
takes
a
shot
the
bullet
shatters
the
window
of
the
hall
door
the
other
two
officers
come
out
of

waves
them
in

direction

run
in
pursuit

grabs
the

at

and
puts

outside

at

buffy
comes
into
the
hall
wearing
a
wool
cap
and
a
long
dark
coat
she
averts
her
eyes
from
the
doctors
and
nurses
on
the
wall
she
finds
a
slot
with
a
few
patient
histories
and
checks
the
names
on
them
there
are
none
she's
interested
in
she
continues
slowly
down
the
hall
avoiding
the
eyes
of
a
passing
doctor
she
checks
another
series
of
slots
for
names
on
paperwork
but
finds
nothing
further
down
the
hall
she
turns
down
the
left
passageway
behinds
her
xander
walks
up
and
touches
her
on
the
back
she
gasps
and
spins
around
but
is
very
relieved
to
see
him
standing
there
buffy
hugs
him
tightly
he
hugs
her
back
and
they
hold
each
other
for
a
long
moment
then
buffy
lets
go
xander
holds
up
his
arm
in
a
cast
xander
sees
two
police
officers
come
into
the
hall
behind
her
he
grabs
her
in
another
tight
hug
buffy
goes
along
with
it
but
wonders
what's
up
when
she
glimpses
the
cops
she
hides
her
face
in
xander's
shoulder
while
they
head
down
the
hall
in
the
direction
that
she
came
in
when
the
police
have
gone
they
separate
again
buffy
smiles
xander
doesn't
smile
back
he
turns
his
face
down
looking
sad
and
very
worried
she
reaches
up
to
willow's
face
and
brushes
back
a
few
stray
hairs
they're
getting
on
a
plane
back
xander
realizes
his
omission

call
him
buffy
hears
some
footsteps
behind
her
and
turns
quickly
to
see
who
it
is

over
his

tries
to
take
advantage
of
her
distraction
and
comes
at
her
with
his
sword
held
high
intending
to
swing
from
above
but
she
drops
to

looks
around
a
bit
and
gets
to
his
feet

she
slowly
lowers
her

his
gentle
touch
on

arm
she
ignores
her
cut
looks
back
up
at
him
and
steps
closer
he
embraces
her
tightly
she
still
isn't
completely
sure
that
it's
true
but
accepts
the
hug
finally
she
accepts
it
closes
her
eyes
and
breathes
out
a
deep
sigh
he
holds
her
even
more
closely
he
sighs
deeply
and
kisses
her
on
the
shoulder
she
cries
into
his
shoulder
and
hugs
him
back
behind
him
acathla
lets
out
a
low
rumble
buffy
opens
her
eyes
and
stares
in
shock
as
acathla's
face
contorts
his
brows
angle
down
his
eyes
glow
red
his
mouth
opens
grotesquely
and
the
swirling
vortex
to

opens
small
at
first

growing
steadily
in

and
emanating
a
deep
red
glow
buffy
lets

looks
up
into

angel
confused
buffy
whispers
reassuringly
she
brushes
her
fingers
over
his
lips
and
across
his
cheek
she
lays
her
hand
on
his
cheek
and
kisses
him
softly
he
returns
the
kiss
and
it
becomes
more
passionate
behind
them
the
vortex
has
grown
to
about
five
feet
15
m
across
and
continues
to
get
larger
buffy
breaks
off
the

and
looks
deeply
into

whispers
angel
whispers
she
touches
his

with

again
she
nods
reassuringly
and
he
closes
his
eyes
she
tries
hard
not
to
start
crying
and
kisses
him
again
gently
she
steps
back
draws
back
her
sword
and
thrusts
it
into
his
chest
his
eyes
whip
open
in
surprise
and
pain
and
a
bright
light
emanates
from
the
sword
she
steps
away
from
him
he
reaches
out
to
her
and
looks
down
at
the
sword
thrust
completely
through
him
he
looks
at
her
imploringly
completely
bewildered
by
this
turn
of
events
she
can
only
stare
at
the
sword
protruding
from
his
chest
and
slowly
steps
further
back
behind
him
the
power
of
the
sword
begins
to
swirl
into
the

buffy
steps
further
back
still
looking
only
at
the
sword
in
his
chest
and
not
into

has
enlarged

35

the
two
energies
begin
to
interact
angel
still
holds
out
his

to
buffy
when
the

finally
meets
him
it
suddenly
closes
into
acathla's

without

as
a
spark
taking
him
with

buffy
stares
at
the

demon
for
a
long
moment

dawning
in
