around

begins
to
rumble
suddenly
the

themselves
start
to
turn
into
monsters
earthcreatures
made
up
of
dirt
and
rock
and
vines
which
detach
themselves
from

black
veins
on

gets
even
stronger
bolts
of
green
magic
shoot
from

body
toward
the
statue
anya
tearfully
she
pauses
for
a
moment
as
if
collecting
her
thoughts
another
tremor
hits
and
anya
ducks
again
hiding
her
face
against
giles's
chest
until
it
subsides
anya
sadly
cut
back
to
the
bluff
green
magic
continues
flowing
from
willow
toward
the
statue
wind
swirls
around
them
filled
with
dirt
and
debris
etc
also
the
everpresent
lightning
the
statue
glows
bright
yellowwhite
suddenly
the
stream
of
magic
is
interrupted
and
the
glowing
subsides
as
xander
appears
in
front
of
the
statue
willow
looks
surprised
willow
sends
a
bolt
of
magic
at
xander
it
lifts
him
off
his
feet
and
throws
him
to
the
ground
at
the
base
of

underneath
a
monster's
arm
and
swings
her
sword
at

it
goes
down
dawn
looks
up
with
a
determined
expression
as
her
monster
prepares
to
attack
her
again
buffy
is
still
being
kept
away
by
another
monster
looks
toward
dawn
with
alarm
dawn
ducks
as
the
monster
grabs
for
her
and
does
a
somersaultroll
past
it
landing
by

sword
she
grabs
the
sword
gets
up
and
stabs
the

in

chest
buffy
watches
with
amazement
dawn
swings
the
sword
again
slicing
off
the
monster's
head
it
falls
down
dead
buffy
stares
dawn
holding
up
the
sword
tiny
smile
buffy
still
looks
amazed
there's
a
very
brief
moment
of
quiet
then
more
monsters
start
to
appear
buffy
and
dawn
back
up
and
end
up
backtoback
facing
the
monsters
each
holding
her
sword
they
begin
to
fight
wide
shot
of
willow
with
the
lightning
going
the
green
magic
begins
flowing
from
her
again
toward
the
statue
earth
rumbling
winds
swirling
etc
xander
sits
up
at
the
base
of
the
temple
holding
his
ribs
he
staggers
to
his
feet
and
blocks
the
flow
of
magic
again
the
magic
stops
flowing
willow
glares
at
him
willow
scornfully
xander
glancing
back
at
the
statue
xander
spreading
out
his
arms
willow
angry
willow
upset
willow
angry
willow
gestures
with
her
hand
no
magic
bolts
of
light
but
xander's
head
jerks
to
the
side
as
if
he's
been
hit
three
parallel
cuts
appear
on
his
cheek
bloody
as
if
scratched
he
puts
his
hand
up
to
them
looks
at
his
fingers
willow
watches
panting
and
looking
a
bit
nervous
xander
looks
back
up
at
her
willow
makes
another
slashing
gesture
xander
doubles
over
and
falls
to
his
knees
panting
he
gets
up
again
and
we
see
that
his
shirt
is
ripped
open
over
the
heart
more
scratches
visible
on
his
chest
he
pants
and
grimaces
from
the
pain
but
faces
willow
again
xander
panting
now
she
does
throw
a
blast
of
magic
at
him
and
he
staggers
backward
but
doesn't
fall
down
willow
still
holds
her
hand
out
a
little
bit
of
magic
crackling
around
it
but
not
as
much
as
she
had
expected
she
looks
surprised
and
anxious
xander
moves
slowly
toward
her
she
sends
another
magic
blast
but
it's
weak
and
barely
hurts
xander
at
all
he
continues
walking
toward
her
willow
continues
holding
out
her
hand
and
making
the
magic
gesture
but
nothing
happens
she
starts
to
get
teary
willow
starts
to
cry
and
as
xander
gets
right
up
to
her
she
starts
hitting
him
with
her
fists
xander
just
stands
there
and
takes
it
after
a
moment
she
stops
hitting
and
starts
to
cry
for
real
she
falls
to
her
knees
and
xander
kneels
with
her
puts
his
arms
around
her
and
holds
her
while
she
sobs
as
willow
continues
to
cry
in
xander's
arms
the
veins
fade
away
from
her
face
and
her
hair
returns
to
its
usual
red
buffy
looks
around
looks
up
toward
the
hole
the
cave
lightens
as
the
sun
begins
to
shine
again
cut
back
to
the
bluff
xander
still
holding
willow
as
she
cries
she
gets
up
and
rushes
back
over
to
him
kneels
beside
him
anya
gives
a
little
cry
of
happiness
and
hugs
giles
hard
he
winces
makes
a
pained
face
anya
lets
him
go
anya
frowns

tries
to
sit
up
and
anya
helps
him
anya
getting
it

this
slowly
starting
to
smile
dawn
buffy
sitting
down
on
a

gives
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
