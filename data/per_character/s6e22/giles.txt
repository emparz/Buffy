you
have
no
idea
you
have
to
stop
what
you're
doing
neither
am
i
stay
down
you
concern
me
willow
stay
on
this
path
and
you'll
wind
up
dead
stay
down
contained
her
and
her
powers
within
a
binding
field
it
puts
her
in
a
kind
of

stasis
for
the
time
giles
looks
at
buffy
for
the
first
time
pauses
buffy
continues
staring
at
willow
you
cut
your
hair
yes
i
noticed
i'm
very
sorry
about
tara
i
came
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
council
haven't
a
clue
about
much
of
anything
really
no
there's
an

an
extremely
powerful
coven
in
devon
they
sensed
the
rise
of
a
dangerous
magical
force
here
in
sunnydale
a
dark
force
fueled
by
grief
i'd
so
hoped
it
wasn't
her
and
then
a
seer
in
the
coven
told
me
about
tara
that's
when
the
coven

imbued
me
with
their
powers
buffy
what's
happened
here
well
willow's
clearly
been
abusing
the
magicks
sorry
duct
tape
because
they
were
figments
of
course
why
didn't
we
see
it
before
i
should
never
have
left
i
know
you're
all
stupid
i
should
never
have
abandoned
you
sometimes
the
most
adult
thing
you
can
do
is

ask
for
help
when
you
need
it
you
have
a
calling
well
the
coven
is
working
on
a

way
to
extract
her
powers
without

killing
her
and
uh
should
she
survive
you
ought
to
know
buffy
that
there's
no
guarantee
she'll

be
as
she
was
willow
has
killed
a
human
being
how
will
she
be
able
to
live
with
herself
vincire
willow
excudo
your
powers

may
be
undeniably
greater
but
i
can
still
hurt
you
if
i
have
to
i
see
if
you
lose
someone
you
love

the
other
people
in
your
life
who
care
about
you
become
meaningless
i
wonder
what
tara
would
say
about
that
go
willow
incurso
perhaps
you're
not
as
strong

as
you
think
you
are
you're
expending
way
too
much
of
your
mystical
energy
to
maintain
your
powers
at
this
rate
you're
going
to

burn
out
and
up
willow
you

you
need
to
stop
willow

it
doesn't
have
to
be

like
that
you

you
can
stop
it
willow
no
anya
i
can
see
willow

i
can
see
her
she
took
the
magic
i
had
and

now

i
know
where
she
is
i
can
feel
what

oh
god
silly
girl
i'm
dying
it
was

it
was
the
only
way
i
thought
we

there'd
be
a
chance

now

i
know
where
willow
is
she's
going
to
finish
it
the
world
there
it's
not
over
no
however
i
am
still
in
some
pain
uh
the
threat's
gone
willow's
been
stopped
yes
the
gift
i
was
given
by
the
coven
was
the
true
essence
of
magic
willow's
magic
came
from
a

place
of
rage
and
power
oh
how
could
i
in
any
case
the
magic
she
took
from
me
tapped
into

the
spark
of
humanity
she
had
left
helped
her
to
feel
again
gave
xander
the
opportunity
to

reach
her
yes
it
was
he
who
got
to
her
in
time
he
saved
us
all
