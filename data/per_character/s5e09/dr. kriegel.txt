yes
of
course
you
two
are
becoming
part
of
the
regular
crew
around
here
good
just
be
careful
you
don't
wear
her
out
well
maybe
some
good
news
will
help
the
blood
work's
come
back
from
the
lab
and
everything
seems
fine
so
we've
scheduled
your
surgery
for
day
after
tomorrow
at
ten
in
the
morning
how's
that
sound
to
you
all
right
joyce
you
take
care
make
sure
you
get
some
good
solid
rest
and
i
mean
that
well
of
course
you
can
come
back
and
visit
your
mother
first
thing
in
the
morning
oh
well
i
understand
that
but
it's
not
necessarily
the
first
thing
i'd
recommend
joyce
there's
no
reason
to
get
upset
even
if
it
would
mean
some
work
for
you
taking
care
of
her
there
are
medications
to
administer
i'd
have
to
go
over
those
with
you
and
i'd
need
for
you
to
check
her
vitals
watch
her
pretty
closely
i'm
afraid
you
won't
get
a
lot
of
sleep
she's
right
let's
do
this
right
we
don't
wanna
forget
anything
well

guess
we're
all
set

you've
got
my
home
phone
number
pager
number
and
here
these
are
the
medications
i
talked
to
you
about
the
sedative
and
so
forth
painkillers
now
if
this
is
gonna
be
too
much
for
you

can
make
your
mom
perfectly
comfortable

a
couple
of
days
