get
down
damn
and
damn
that's
something
it's
old
it's
strong
and
it
feels
like
like
it's
mine
i
guess
that
means
it's
yours
slayer
in
charge
which
i'm
guessing
is
you
it
never
mattered
to
me
somebody
has
to
lead
let's
vote
for
chaoahn
it's
harder
to
lead
people
into
a
deathtrap
if
you
don't
speak
english
i'm
really
not
looking
for
forgiveness
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
i
blew
it
tell
that
to—
so
here's
the
laugh
riot
my
whole
life
i've
been
a
loner
i'm
trying
to—
no
ties
no
buddies
no
relationships
that
lasted
longer
than
well
robin
lasted
pretty
long
boy's
got
stamina
don't
tell
me
you
two
got
wriggly
ok
the
point
me
by
myself
all
the
time
i'm
looking
at
you
everything
you
have
and
i
don't
know
jealous
then
there
i
am
everybody's
looking
to
me
trusting
me
to
lead
them
and
i've
never
felt
so
alone
in
my
entire
life
and
that's
you
every
day
isn't
it
there's
only
supposed
to
be
one
maybe
that's
why
you
and
i
can
never
get
along
we're
not
supposed
to
exist
together
good
point
also
a
factor
and
no
one
else
can
feel
it
thank
god
we're
hot
chicks
with
superpowers
comforting
