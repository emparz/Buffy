ooh
jaffa
cakes
did
you
find
buffy
i'm
afraid
we
have
slightly
worse
news
here
faith
hasn't
returned
with
the
other
girls
something's
gone
wrong
good
just
mind
her
head
still
unconscious
though
and
ignoring
that
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
this
is
really
quite
ingenious
in
addition
to
being
ancient
it's
clearly
mystical
i
can't
imagine
how
something
like
this
could
exist
without
my
having
heard
of
it
right
um
any
chance
that
it
might
be
something
other
than
a
tool
for
killing
things
we'll
start
work
immediately
no
it's
older
than
that
it's
prechristian
native
american
well
i
have
reference
to
the
sword
of
moskva
the
uhreaper
of
the
tigrisâ€”how
are
we
supposed
to
narrow
this
down
the
illustrations
are
never
clear
enough
oh
damn
we're
running
out
of
time
we
really
haven't
got
anything
useful
do
you
sense
any
of
the
power
that
buffy
spoke
about
tapping
into
magicks
might
help
with
that
willow
you
could
do
it
without
endangering
yourself
and
if
it
was
necessary
all
right
do
what
you
can
that's
all
any
of
us
can
do
let
me
see
it's
not
a
question
mark
it's
the
international
phonetics
alphabet
symbol
for
glottal
stop
it's
sort
of
a
gulping
noise
i'mremembering
something
here
um
ah
hieroglyphs
hieroglyphs
stand
for
sets
of
consonants
as
you
know
m
plus
glottal
stop
is
represented
by
a
picture
that's
commonly
thought
to
symbolize
a
sickle
or
a
scythe
it's
in
thousands
of
carvings
in
egypt
throughout
the
ancient
world
go
back
see
what
else
we
can
find
out
about
this
temple
the
scythe
is
a
symbol
of
death
let's
see
where
these
pagans
buried
their
dead
