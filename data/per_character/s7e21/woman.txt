comes
from
the
waiting
mind
plays
tricks
i
see
you've
found
our
weapon
one
of
many
welltime
was
now
i'm
alone
in
the
world
nope
i'm
as
real
as
you
are
justwell
let
me
put
it
this
way—
i
look
good
for
my
age
i've
been
waiting
you
pulled
it
out
of
the
rock
i
was
one
of
those
who
put
it
in
there
a
weapon
a
scythe
forged
in
secrecy
for
one
like
you
who—
i'm
sorry
what's
your
name
no
really
we
forged
it
in
secrecy
and
kept
it
hidden
from
the
shadow
men
who—
ahh
yes
then
you
know
and
they
became
the
watchers
and
the
watchers
watched
the
slayers
but
we
were
watching
them
guardians
women
who
want
to
help
and
protect
you
we
forged
this
centuries
ago
halfway
around
the
world
forged
there
it
was
put
to
use
right
hereto
kill
the
last
pure
demon
that
walked
upon
the
earth
the
rest
were
already
driven
under
and
then
there
were
men
here
and
then
there
were
monks
and
then
there
was
a
town
and
now
there
was
you
and
the
scythe
remained
hidden
we
hid
too
we
had
to
until
now
we're
the
last
surprise
that
is
really
up
to
you
this
is
a
powerful
weapon
but
you
already
have
weapons
use
it
wisely
and
perhaps
you
can
beat
back
the
rising
dark
one
way
or
another
it
can
only
mean
an
end
is
truly
near
