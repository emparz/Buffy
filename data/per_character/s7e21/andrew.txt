it
was
pretty
amazing
a
whole
grocery
store
just
abandoned
food
lying
around
everywhere
uh
the
produce
was
on
its
way
to
funky
town
but—
uh
the
apples
still
look
pretty
good
so
everyone
should
uh
check
those
out

that
spell
with
the
little
lights

been
here
keeping
morale
up
because

working
on
that
morale
thing

liked
the
real
bandages
better

bed
sheets

awfully
festive

supposed
to
use
that
to
sterilize
wounds

be
all

a
box
of
ointment
here

used
one
of
these
on
a
rash
once

healed
up
but
it
was
red
and
crusty
with
these
little
itchy
places
