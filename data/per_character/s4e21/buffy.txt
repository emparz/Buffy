out
of
here
whatever
he's
planning
is
about
to
go
down
willow

the
disks
right
where's
anya
why
because
of
the
things
that
we
said
will
who
told
you
we
were
talking
behind
your
back
specifically
and
who
told
you
that
we
thought
you'd
be
better
off
joining
the
army
he
played
us
he
wanted
us
to
fight
to
split
us
up
that's
where
it
came
from
the
stuff
we
said
the
other
night
good
great
i
think
it
was
more
than
that
i
think
it
was
adam
i
just
went
to
adam's
lair
and
he
was
gone
but
spike
just
happened
to
be
there
he
made
this
big
noise
about
getting
information
off
those
encrypted
disks
adam
fed
spike
those
disks
it
has
to
be
he
wanted
me
to
know
about
his
evilguy
assembly
line
this
lab
it's
in
the
initiative
we'll
give
the
demon
his
due
he
thought
this
one
out
you
know
how
overcrowded
the
containment
cells
have
been
at
the
initiative
those
demons
were
just
too
easy
to
catch
it's
like
they
wanted
in
that
place
adam's
gonna
make
sure
the
demons
attack
the
initiative
from
the
inside
i've
got
to
shut
him
down
giles
his
final
phase
is
about
to
start
they're
not
gonna
listen
to
me
he's
a
deserter
he
got
some
bad
news
anyway
and
kinda
took
off
he
wants
me
there
probably
figures
i'll
even
the
kill
ratio
no
he's
really
not
according
to
riley
his
power
source
is
uranium
core
embedded
somewhere
inside
his
chest

near
the
spine
