oh
hello
um
oh
uh
pardon
the
robe
it's
a
bit
of
a
late
start
oh
yes
quite
well
thank
you
i'lli'll
probably
have
a
brisk
jog
later
on
did
you
want
something
uh
yes
please
please
come
in
will
you
be
working
here

typingtalking
because
um

will
be
fine
right
yes
well
good
luck
withwith
all
that
bye
well
uhssspike
can
be
very
convincing
whenwhenwhen
uhi'm
very
stupid
of
course
well
piffle
let's
move
on
what
did
they
say
the
trojan
horse
we
need
to
warn
the
initiative
certainly
no
lack
of
supplies
i
only
wish
i
knew
which
ones
would
kill
adam
perhaps
a
paralyzing
spell
only
i
can't
perform
the
incantation
for
this
i
do
speak
sumerian
it's
not
that
only
aan
experienced
witch
can
incant
it
and
you'd
have
to
be
within
striking
distance
of
this
object
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
are
xander
just
because
this
is
never
gonna
work
there's
no
need
to
be
negative
it's
very
powerful
it's
also
extraordinarily
dangerous
magic
gourd
jolly
good
howhow
exactly
do
you
plan
to
get
close
enough
to
adam
to
remove
his
power
source
the
enjoining
spell
is
extremely
touchy
it's
uh
volatile
wewe
can't
risk
it

being
interrupted
we
need
a
place
that's
close
to
you
and
quiet
you
sure
it
uh
should
do
five
minutes
give
or
take
sophusmind
yes
thank
you
although
your
heroism
has
been
slightly
muted
by
the
fact
that
you
were
helping
adam
to
start
a
war
that
would
kill
us
all
buffy
