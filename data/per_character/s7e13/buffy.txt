i
think
we've
managed
a
bit
longer
than
that
i
know
but
you
should
go
this
trip
is
important
for
the
girls
to
understand
the
source
of
their
power
and
to
know
how
to
use
it
right
that's
not
exactly
how
i
put
it
i—

my
responsibility
as
mentor
role
model
life
guide—oh

two
whole
days

kitchen
since
they've
been
here
i
noticed
ok
but
you've
been
fine
in
close
contact
with
the
girls
we
just
need
to
make
sure
the
trigger's
deactivated
then
we've
got
a
couple
of
days
lack
of
pitterpatter
and
all
what
ow
what's
wrong
spike
what
is
going
on
oh
in
the
goes
part
of
comes

you'd
think
that
for
the
other
patient
mmhmm
will
how
much
do
you
know
about
the
chip
even
with
the
chip
spike
was
able
to
hurt
all
those
people
when
he
was
brainwashed
maybe
something's
wrong
with
it
remember
when
things
used
to
be
nice
and
boring
have
fundelivering
tea
there's
gotta
be
a
reason
why
the
chip
is
going
all
wonky
maybe
it's
related
to
the
trigger
or
maybe
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
new
soul
well
we'll
fix
it
we'll
hit
serious
research
mode—
ok
you're
right
not
a
book
thing
it's
a
phone
thing
doubt
it
yes
agent
finn
riley
tell
him
we're
having
a
problem
with
spike's
chip
no
his
chip
spike
no
no
finn
is
his
last
name
yeah
well
did
he
used
to
work
there
and
then
he
got
transferred
oh
is
this
actually
a
flower
shop
or
is
this
one
of
those
things
where
i'm
supposed
to
play
along
to
show
that
i
know
it's
really
secret
ops
oh
maybe
i
shouldn't
have
said
that
oh
ok
right
well
if
some
guy
named
finn
shows
up
to
buy
flowers—
yeah
thanks
wrong
number
or
a
giant
government
conspiracy
one
or
the—
spike
what
the
hell
is
going
on
here—
ow
what
makes
you
think
that
guys
ok
say
you're
right
and
you
did
do
this
to
yourself
why
would
your
subconscious
turn
you
into
warren
we'll
deal
we'll
get
help
on
your
own
why
it's
kinda
a
little
late
for
that
spike

right
here
i
kinda
figured
maybe
they'll
call
back
maybe
they'll
send
help
eh
nothing
good
on
tv
tonight
maybe
we
should
search
for
files
and
stuff
find
out
everything
we
can
about
the
chip—shelf
life
ready
be
careful
oh
god

just
left
them

like
it
was
coming
from
