um
it's
actually
her
i
can
tell
i
know
her
ok
here's
the
thing
hi
here's
the
thing
i'll
just
get
this
out
of
the
way
i'm
sorta
screwed
up
but
i
mean
you
already
knew
that
'cause
you
lived
it
gotcha
it's
ok
vaughn
i
wanna
do
this
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
really
see
myself
but
i
did
because
you
know
that's
the
crazy
thing
about
hitting
rock
bottom
you
get
to
relive
all
the
crappy
things
you
did
and
i
wanted
to
come
find
you
and
tell
you
that
i
was
here
working
on
things
with
these
guys
and
that
they're
good
and
that
i'm
sorry
but
you're
here
looking
like—
wow
how
did
this
happen
yeah
see
the
thing
is
we're
more
about
healing
spirits
and
nurturing
our
life
force
here
but
we'll
try
give
back
the
form
the
soul
requires
see
that
the
balance
is
put
right
it
didn't
work
you
slapped
me
they
took
off
it
was
a
little
too
creepy
even
for
us
you're
really
worried
about
her
look
she's
gonna
be
fine
really
she's
good
at
this
she's
strong
and
she's
dealt
with
a
lot
worse
long
before
she
ever
went
out
and
found
herself
a
big
old
potential
slayer
bodyguard
ok
just
have
a
little
faith
in
her
oh
no
i
think
you
did
when
you
first
got
here
you
told
us—
oops
what
to
willow
oh
just
your
standard
penance
malediction
is
all
i
put
a
hex
on
her
oh
that's
rich
that
must've
been
some
kiss
you
must
be
good
the
hex
i
cast
lets
the
victim's
subconscious
pick
the
form
of
their
punishment
it's
always
better
than
anything
i
can
come
up
with
elegant
you
know
ok
oh
wait
i
forgot—no
this
is
not
about
hate
it's
about
power
willow
always
had
all
the
power
long
before
she
even
knew
what
to
do
with
it
just
came
so
easy
for
her
the
rest
of
us—we
had
to
work
twice
as
hard
to
be
half
as
good
but
no
one
cares
about
how
hard
you
work
they
just
care
about
cute
sweet
willow
they
don't
know
how
weak
she
is
she
gave
in
to
evil—stuff
worse
than
i
can
even
imagine—
she
almost
destroyed
the
world
and
yet
everyone
keeps
on
loving
her
so
what's
wrong
with
having
a
little
fun
huh
taking
her
down
a
peg
or
two
it
was
just
a
game
it's
not
my
fault
if
she's
losing
herself
hey
i'm
not
the
bad
guy
here
but
i
wonder
where
he'd
be
right
about
now
