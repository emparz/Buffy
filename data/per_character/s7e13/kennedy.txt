hey
well
the
lighting
in
here
is
good
maybe
it's
just—
noi
was
never
sick
willow
chill
there's
a
reason
i
didn't
go
i
have
a
thing
a
separate
thing
something's
coming
down
i
have
my
own
mission
and
i
need
you
help
oh
yeah
hey
trust
me
i
told
you
i
have
a
thing
come
on
come
on
just
hang
out
with
me
a
little
you're
sexy
when
you
pout
to
get
you
to
stay
ok
one
drink
i
can
work
with
that
let's
start
with
the
easy
stuff
how
long
have
you
known
that
you're
gay
ok
how
long
have
you
enjoyed
having
sex
with
women
ok
you
know
there's
a
better
word
for
that
right
you
really
haven't
been
getting
out
there
much
have
you
no
no
of
course
not
that
wouldn't
be
any
fun
the
fun
part
is
the
process
of—of
getting
to
know
a
girl
it's
like—it's
like
flirting
in
code
it's
using
body
language
and
laughing
at
the
right
jokes
and—and
looking
into
her
eyes
and
knowing
she's
still
whispering
to
you
even
when
she's
not
saying
a
word
and
that
sense
that
if
you
can
just
touch
her
just
once
everything
will
be
ok
for
both
of
you
that's
how
you
can
tell
or
if
she's
really
hot
you
just
get
her
drunk—see
if
she
comes
on
to
you
lucky
woman
do
your
parents
know
classic
i'm
sorry
it
must've—
it
was
gone
with
the
wind
i
saw
that
and
i
knew
i
wanted
to
sweep
scarlet
off
her
feet
well
i'm
not
saying
the
sweeping
would
have
been
easy
what
have
you
seen
you
and
we
like
the
same
things—italian
skate
punk
robert
parker
mysteries
fighting
evil
ok
i
dig
the
way
you
always
turn
off
the
moulin
rouge
dvd
at
chapter
32
so
it
has
a
happy
ending
i
like
the
way
you
speak
it's
interesting
and
your
freckleslikeable
i'm
not
so
into
the
magic
stuff
it
seems
like
fairy
tale
crap
to
me
but
if
it
matters
to
you
you
care
about
it
so
it's
cool
yes
kinda
cleared
the
air
you
know
in
the
spirit
of
air
clearing
i
feel
like
i
need
to
be
honest
about
something
no
no
it's
just—
i
think
you
should
know
i
don't—what
are
you
what
is
that
ok
hold
up
a
sec
i
don't
know
i'm
not
sure
we
were
up
in
willow's
room
and
we
were—
it's
willow
ok
safe
to
say
no
one
will
ever
accuse
you
of
being
too
butch
come
on
i
mean
you
turned
into
a
guy
i
mean
if
you
take
a
step
back
seriously
there's
a
certain
element
of
humor
here
right
well
a
really
really
big
step
so
you
got
a
plan
i
thought
you
were
gonna
try
it
yourself
all
the
more
reason
for
me
to
go
with
you
plus
i
was
there
when
it
happened
lemme
come
to
try
to
help
too
by
yourself
why
given
how
'bout
i
just
tag
along
anyway
keep
you
company
i'm
taking
that
as
a
yes
you
know
where
you're
going
hey
that's
what
we're
here
to
find
out
i
mean
if
we're
done
with
all
the
group
hugging
what
if
she
can't
handle
this
willow
willow
willow
ok
you're
upset
getting
angry
isn't
helping
we
can
still
try
to—
willow
willow
wait
where'd
they
go
i
never
said
i
was
a
potential
slayer
no
i
didn't
how
did
you
know
who
i
was
tell
me
why
you
did
this
to
her
what
did
you
do
to
her
ok
and
that's
magic
crazy
talk
for
what
i
got
that
part
but
why
warren
and
why
did
it
happen
after
we
kissed
answer
me
undo
it
let
her
out
why
would
you
do
this
to
her
you
really
hate
her
that
much
fun
she's
disappearing
fading
away
in
that
creep
and
you
think
it's
fun
i'm
gonna
stop
you
now
you
know
well
that
was
a
hell
of
a
thing
do
get
away
with—
ok
let's
not
get
excited
willow
what
did
you
make
happen
you
mean
him
you
said
her
no
no
it
wasn't
you
said
i
was
there
who
did
you
kill
willow
tara
no
kissing
me
didn't
mean
th—
willow
no
willow
i
don't
think
you
did
anything
wrong
this
is
just
magic
and
i
think
i'm
figuring
the
whole
magic
thing
out
it's
just
like
fairy
tales
bringing
you
back
to
life
hmm
i
am
good
are
you
all
right
yeah
i'll
make
you
some
tea
