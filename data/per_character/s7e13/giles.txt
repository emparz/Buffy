are
you
sure
you'll
all
be
all
right
right
oh
dawn
vi's
left
her
notebook
on
the
mantelpiece
would
you
mind
running
it
out
to
the
car
while
you're
at
it
you
smack
her
in
the
head
with
it
and
remind
her
not
to
leave
it
lying
around
i'm
just
a
bit
twitchy
about
leaving
you
alone
again
here
while—while
things
are
in
such
a
state
of
flux
do
you
think
they
appreciate
the
gravity
of
what
we're
undertaking
it's
frightening
and
it's
difficult
and
then
apparently
someone
told
them
that
the
vision
quest
consists
of
me
driving
them
to
the
desert
doing
the
hokey
pokey
until
a
spooky
rastamama
slayer
arrives
and
speaks
to
them
in
riddles
ah
yes
smores
i'm
going
to
end
up
singing
campfire
songs
aren't
i
oh
god
what
please
be
safe
while
i'm
away
we
all
feel
each
other
including
some
of
us
who
don't
know
each
other
well
enough
to
take
such
liberties
thank
you
i
assume
there's
a
perfectly
reasonable
and
not
at
all
insane
explanation
here
oh
that's
very
sweet
now
wait
a
minute—you
think
i'm
evil
if
i
bring
a
group
of
girls
on
a
camping
trip
and
don't
touch
them
