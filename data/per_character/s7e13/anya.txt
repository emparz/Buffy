let
molly
out
of
the
trunk

never
actually
realized
just
how
compact
molly

not
interested
in
any
of
your
evil
lies
we've
heard
'em
all
buffy
wait

happened
oh
like
a
glamour
xander
giles
never
mentioned
any
of
this
or
maybe
he
didn't
make
it
look
i'm
not
saying
it's
a
happy
scenario
but
we're
dealing
with
a
big
bad
that
can
be
any
dead
person
it
wants
become
the
one
person
she
trusts
more
than
anybody
else

not
like

touched
anything

an
eye

is
what're
we
expecting

so
fast
with
the
big
phew
which
means
we're
already
too
late
and
we're
heading
out
to
the
middle
of
nowhere
just
a
teenager
a
powerful
former
demon
and
two
big
geeks
we
thought
you
might
be
noncorporeal
evil
