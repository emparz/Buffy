hi
riley
i'm
fine
bordering
on
chipper
and
tomorrow
planning
on
being
obnoxious
buffy
when
you
have
a
minute
i'd
like
to
go
over
the
grocery
list
for
next
week
are
you
disinfecting
something
but
you
keep
pushing
the
envelope
honey
oh
great
thanks
hon
i'm
fine
have
you
seen
my
conditioner
oh
i
was
hoping
to
put
this
off
but
you
know
the
nothing
that
i've
been
dealing
with
the
last
couple
of
weeks
it
might
not
be
nothing
i'm
staying
overnight
at
the
hospital
for
observation
i'm
getting
a
cat
scan
it's
only
one
night
and
they
say
even
if
there
is
something
it's
still
very
early
if
they
didn't
see
it
before
i'm
going
to
be
fine
