quite
a
few
american
beers
that
are
highly
underrated

not
one
of
them

want
to
learn
all
about
how
i
bested
the
slayers
and
you
want
to
learn
fast

fought
i
won
the
end

up
what
did

want
eh
a
quick
demo
a
blowforblow
description
you
can
map
out
and
memorize
it's
not
about
the
moves
love
and
since
i
agreed
to
your
little
proposition
we
can
do
this
my
way
wings
spicy
buffalo
wings
order
me
up
a
plate
i'm
feelin'
peckish
as
i
thought
some
nasty
thing
got
a
taste
of
you
oh
right
stuck
in
a
dark
corner
with
a
creature
you
loathe
diggin'
up
past
uglies
'cause
you're
fine
i
told
you
no
one's
narrating
on
an
empty
stomach
here

can
i
tell
you
baby
i've
always
been
bad
luminous
oh
no
no
no
irradiant's
better
oh
quickly
i'm
the
very
spirit
of
vexation
what's
another
word
for
gleaming
it's
a
perfectly
perfect
word
as
many
words
go
but
the
bother
is
nothing
rhymes
you
see
cecily
i
prefer
not
to
think
of
such
dark
ugly
business
at
all
that's
what
the
police
are
for
i
prefer
placing
my
energies
into
creating
things
of
beauty
careful
the
inks
are
still
wet
please
it's
not
finished
cecily
oh
they're
vulgarians
they're
not
like
you
and
i
they're
about
how
i
feel
every
syllable
oh
i
know
it's
sudden
and
please
if
they're
no
good
they're
only
words
but
the
feeling
behind
them
i
love
you
cecily
i
know
i'm
a
bad
poet
but
i'm
a
good
man
and
all
i
ask
is
that
that
you
try
to
see
me
watch
where
you're
going
nothing
i
wish
to
be
alone
that's
quite
close
enough
i've
heard
tales
of
london
pickpockets
you'll
not
be
getting
my
purse
i
tell
you
oh
yes
i
mean
no
i
mean
mother's
expecting
me
effulgent
oh
yes
god
yes
no
please
don't
make
it
sound
like
something
you'd
flip
past
on
the
discovery
channel
becoming
a
vampire
is
a
profound
and
powerful
experience
i
could
feel
this
new
strength
coursing
through
me
getting
killed
made
me
feel
alive
for
the
very
first
time
i
was
through
living
by
society's
rules
decided
to
make
a
few
of
my
own
of
course
in
order
to
do
that
i
had
to
get
myself
a
gang
ike
it's
spike
now
you'd
do
well
to
remember
it
mate
oh
i'm
sorry
did
i
sully
our
good
name
we're
vampires
bollocks
that
stuff's
for
the
frilly
cuffsandcollars
crowd
i'll
take
a
good
brawl
any
day
yeah
you
know
what
i
prefer
to
being
hunted
getting
caught
sod
off
come
on
when
was
the
last
time
you
unleashed
it
all
out
fight
in
a
mob
back
against
the
wall
nothing
but
fists
and
fangs
don't
you
ever
get
tired
of
fights
you
know
you're
going
to
win
poofter
now
you're
gettin'
it
what's
a
slayer
after
that
i
was
obsessed
i
mean
to
most
vampires
the
slayer
was
the
subject
of
cold
sweat
and
frightened
whispers
but
i
never
hid
hell
i
sought
her
out
i
mean
if
you're
looking
for
fun
there's
death
there's
glory
and
sod
all
else
right
i
was
young
funny
you
should
ask
lesson
the
first

a
slayer
must
always
reach
for
her
weapon
i've
already
got
mine
a
good
thing
too
become
a
vampire
you've
got
nothing
to
fear
nothing
but
one
girl
that's
you
honey
back
then
it
was
her
just
like
i
pictured
it
this
good
for
you
i'm
sorry
love
i
don't
speak
chinese
a
fella
could
get
used
to
this
you
ever
hear
them
saying
the
blood
of
a
slayer
is
a
powerful
aphrodisiac
here
now
have
a
taste
no
need
to
be
humble
don't
be
so
glum
mate
the
way
you
tell
it
one
slayer
snuffs
it
another
one
rises
i
figure
there's
a
new
chosen
one
getting
all
chosen
as
we
speak
i
tell
you
what
when
and
if
this
new
bird
does
show
up
i'll
give
you
first
crack
at
her
that
was
the
best
night
of
my
life
and
i've
had
some
sweet
ones
what
are
you
looking
at
well
yeah
i
suppose
you're
telling
me
you
don't
how
many
of
my
kind
reckon
you've
done
and
we
just
keep
coming
but
you
can
kill
a
hundred
a
thousand
a
thousand
thousands
and
the
enemies
of
hell
besides
and
all
we
need
is
for
one
of
us
just
one
sooner
or
later
to
have
the
thing
we're
all
hoping
for
one
good
day
hey
you
asked
and
i'm
tellin'
the
problem
with
you
summers
is
you've
gotten
so
good
you're
starting
to
think
you're
immortal
oh
then
how
do
you
explain
this
not
even
close
come
on
lesson
the
second

ask
the
right
questions
you
want
to
know
how
i
beat
'em
the
question
isn't
how'd
i
win
the
question
is
why'd
they
lose
there's
a
big
difference
love
hmm
a
bit
like
this
i
knew
i
couldn't
touch
you
if
there's
no
intent
to
hurt
you
then
that
chip
they
shoved
up
my
brain
never
activates
if
on
the
other
hand
see
now
that
hurt
you're
not
ready
to
know
okay
then
went
like
this
the
first
was
all
business
but
the
second
she
had
a
touch
of
your
style
she
was
cunning
resourceful
oh
did
i
mention
hot
i
could
have
danced
all
night
with
that
one
that's
all
we've
ever
done
and
the
thing
about
the
dance
is
you
never
get
to
stop
every
day
you
wake
up
it's
the
same
bloody
question
that
haunts
you

is
today
the
day
i
die
death
is
on
your
heels
baby
and
sooner
or
later
it's
gonna
catch
you
and
part
of
you
wants
it
not
only
to
stop
the
fear
and
uncertainty
but
because
you're
just
a
little
bit
in
love
with
it
death
is
your
art
you
make
it
with
your
hands
day
after
day
that
final
gasp
that
look
of
peace
part
of
you
is
desperate
to
know

what's
it
like
where
does
it
lead
you
and
now
you
see
that's
the
secret
not
the
punch
you
didn't
throw
or
the
kicks
you
didn't
land
every
slayer
has
a
death
wish
even
you
the
only
reason
you've
lasted
as
long
as
you
have
is
you've
got
ties
to
the
world
your
mum
your
brat
kid
sister
the
scoobies
they
all
tie
you
here
but
you're
just
putting
off
the
inevitable
sooner
or
later
you're
gonna
want
it
and
the
second
the
second
that
happens
you
know
i'll
be
there
i'll
slip
in
have
myself
a
real
good
day
here
endeth
the
lesson
i
just
wonder
if
you'll
like
it
as
much
as
she
did
oh
did
i
scare
ya
you're
the
slayer
do
something
about
it
hit
me
come
on
one
good
swing
you
know
you
want
to
so
do
i
give
it
me
good
buffy
do
it
come
on
i
can
feel
it
slayer
you
know
you
want
to
dance
beneath
me
i'll
show
her
put
her
six
bloody
feet
beneath
me
hasn't
got
a
death
wish
bitch
won't
need
one
i've
got
two
barrels
here
that'll
prove
you
wrong
sure
it'll
hurt
like
hell
for
about
two
hours
but
she'll
be
dead
just
a
little
longer
than
that
you're
the
one
who
keeps
bringing
her
up
i
haven't
said
a
word
about
the
bloody
slayer
since
we
left
california
she's
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
dru
but
i
did
pet
i
did
it
for
you
you
keep
punishing
me
carrying
on
with
creatures
like
this
so
this
is
my
fault
now
yeah
why
don't
you
do
that
what's
wrong
is
there
something
i
can
do
