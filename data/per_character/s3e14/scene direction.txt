and

swings
at

in
the

has
a
determined
look
on
her
face
she
jabs
the
sword
straight
at

for

and
run
in
for
a
good
fight

boys
come
over
to
them
and
dance
around
them

shows
a
brief
view
from
above

the
two
girls
surrounded
by
the
boys
they
pretty
much
ignore
the
guys
and
just
hump
the
air
around
them
angel
walks
under
the
stairs
to
the
edge
of
the
dance
floor
and
stops
to
watch
a
look
of
deep
concern
on
his
face
the
camera
shows
another
brief
shot
of
them
from

makes
a
move
to

out
from

walks
onto

and
grabs
faith
she
pulls
her
out
of
the
crowd
and
toward
the
door
faith
lets
herself
be
led
away
but
points
back
at
the

bummed
to

enormously
obese
with
very
pale
pasty
slimy

he
sits
suspended
in
a
tank
of
filthy
water
while
one
of
the
eliminati
pours
ladle
after
ladle
of
it
over
him
in
an
effort
to
keep
his
skin
moist
he
holds
out
his
hands
and
the
air
between
him
and
the
vampires
is
suddenly
disturbed
the
vampire
floats
involuntarily
over
to
balthazar
who
grabs
his
throat
and
squeezes
until
his
neck
breaks
and
he
slumps
lifelessly
to
the
floor
vincent
watches
extremely
worried
that
he
may
be
next
he
wheezes
hard
as
vincent
slowly
approaches
vincent
leans
toward
him
vincent
leans
close
enough
to
be
spat
upon
balthazar
puts
his
hands
on
vincent's
shoulders
cut
outside
faith
and
buffy
look
for
the
packing
warehouse
and
find
it
they
look
in
through
a
crack
in
the
door
and
see
balthazar
surrounded
by
the
eliminati
faith
looks
around
across
the
street
at
the
end
of
the
alley
she
sees
meyer's
sport
and
tackle
shop
she
points
buffy
in
that
direction
they
head
for
the
store
she
spies
a
small
crossbow
complete
with
4x
optical
sights
on
display
beneath
the
glass
countertop
she
breaks
the
glass
with
her
elbow

in
and
pulls
it
out

walks
to
a
vertical
case
faith
breaks
it
faith
reaches
in
for
a
set
of
nun
chucks
faith
stuffs
them
into
her
pants
buffy
seems
a
bit
unsure
but
changes
her
mind
when
she
spies
a
case
of
hunting
knives
buffy
walks
to
the
case
buffy
stops
in
front
of
it
she
punches
the
glass
with
her
fist
and
it
breaks
disturbing
a
dagger
which
she
catches
as
it
falls
she
pulls
her
hand
out
and
turns
the
blade
over
in
her
hand
smiling
faith
smiles
too
seeing
that
buffy
is
finally
coming
around
to
her
way
of
thinking
she
turns
around
and
sees
a
compound
hunting
bow
under
the
glass
of
another
display
case
and
kicks
it
in
buffy
just
gives
her
a
brief
glance
faith
pulls
the
bow
out
and
looks
it
over
then
smiles
at
her
partner
in
slayage
but
before
they
can
get
any
further
they
are
surprised
by
a
gunshot
they
spin
around
to
see
they've
been
caught
by
two
police
officers
they
both
have
their
service
revolvers
aimed
at
them
inside
meyer's
sport
and
tackle
the
police
officer
takes
a
step
closer
eyeing
the
two
girls
buffy
slowly
reaches
her
hand
out
and
sets
the
dagger
on
a
counter
the
officer
is
satisfied
and
turns
his
attention
to
faith
she
gives
in
but
isn't
as
gentle
with
the
hunting
bow
as
buffy
was
with
the
knife
simply
extending
her
arm
and
tossing
it
aside
the
two
officers
visibly
relax
a
bit
but
keep
their
guns
up
and
ready
faith
haughtily
buffy's
eyes
go
wide
with
concern
for
what
faith
might
do
the
officers
tense
up
again
faith
smiles
at
him
but
does
as
she's
told
and
raises
her
arms
over
her
head
buffy
raises
hers
as
well
but
just
level
to
her
shoulders
officer
to
his
partner
his
partner
holsters
his
gun
and
reaches
into
his
belt
for
his
cuffs

one
still
holding
the
gun

to

smiling
sexily
cut
inside
the
police
car
buffy
and
faith
are
in
the
back
seat
with
their
hands
cuffed
behind
their
backs
a
heavy
steel
mesh
separates
them
from
the
officers
in
the
front
seat
faith
sarcastically
the
officer
laughs
faith
doesn't
think
it's
funny
faith
quietly
to
buffy
she
slouches
down
in
the
seat
buffy
realizes
what
she
intends
and
isn't
at
all
sure
it's
a
good
idea
faith
impatiently
buffy
sees
the
truth
in
that
and
slowly
slouches
down
also
faith
raises
her
legs
and
buffy
follows
her
lead
faith
quietly
they
both
pushkick
hard
into
the
steel
mesh
making
it
buckle
and
tear
at
the
edges
and
hit
the
officers
in
the
backs
of
their
heads
the
driver
loses
control
of
the
car
and
it
swerves
screechingly
to
the
left
and
smashes
into
a
parked
car

damage
isn't
terribly
serious

the
police
car's
radiator
has
burst
and
the
steam
rises
thickly
obscuring
the
view

officers
are
unconscious

climbs
out
of

a
moment
later

comes
out

to
herself
she
drops
the
bow
but
holds
on
to
the
arrow
she
ducks
a
roundhouse
kick
from
the
demon
and
the
momentum
of
the
kick
without
a
hit
makes
him
keep
spinning
before
he
lands

does
a
sidekick
to
his
side
and
he
staggers
into
the
side
of
a

gets
up
holding
her
stake
having

start
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
packing
warehouse
suddenly
another
eliminatus
lands
in

of
them
and
thrusts
at
faith
with
his
short
sword
she
reacts
instantly
catching
his
arm
and
shoving
him
into
a
crate
then
pulling
him
off
and
swinging
him
backward
onto
a
pile
of
several
chords
of
wood
buffy
steps
right
in
and
stakes
him
he
crumbles
to
ash
the
two
slayers
continue
along
the
alley
at
a
brisk
pace
at
the
end
of
the
building
an
arm
reaches
out
and
grabs
buffy
by
the
shoulder

she
grabs
the
man
and
throws
him
against
a
dumpster

jumps
right
in
to

slumps
down
to
the
ground
hurt
by
the
impact
against
the
heavy
steel
container
it's

but
faith
is
too
caught
up
in
things
and
doesn't
realize
he's
human
faith
swings
down
with
her
stake
and
plunges
it
into
allan's
heart
then
pulls
it
out

grabs
his
chest
in
pain
and
surprise
blood
pours
out
freely
pumped
out
by
his
now
punctured
beating
heart
faith
backs
away
as
buffy
quickly
gets
down
beside
him
to
try
to
help
him
allan
pulls
his
hands
away
and
looks
down
at
them
covered
in
his
own
blood
shaking
hard
as
he
goes
into
shock
buffy
looks
at
the
wound
and
sees
its
severity
faith
shocked
buffy
to
faith
behind
her
faith
is
paralyzed
with

shakes
even
harder
as
the
blood

increases
he
looks
up
at
buffy
buffy
to
allan
she
tries
to
apply
pressure
to
the
wound
but
the
blood
just
keeps
coming
buffy
to
faith
allan
begins
to
convulse
his
eyes
go
wide
with
the
fear
of
death
as
blood
begins
to
trickle
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
he
tries
to
say
something
but
can't
get
the
words
out
buffy
can
only
watch
in
despair
unable
to
help
allan
looks
down
at
his
chest
one
last
time
then
reaches
up
to
buffy
but
his
arm
never
makes
it
it
falls
to
his
side
and
his
body
relaxes
against
the
dumpster
finally
dead
his
eyes
remain
wide
open
staring
up
into
nothing
buffy
stares
back
at
him
in
open
mouthed
horror
the
alley

lies
dead
against
the
dumpster
faith
begins
to
