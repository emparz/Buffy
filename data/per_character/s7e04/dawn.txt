i
think
this
thing
has
a
freakin'
child
lock
on
it
you
know
i'm
not
the
shortest
one
here
i
don't
know
why
i
had
to
be
in
the
kid
coffin
well
the
whole
willow
sitch
is
not
unstressifyingi
mean
she's
here
but
not
part
of
the
gang
here
and
hopefully
not
under
my
feet
here
in
another
time
dimension
here
you'll
be
fine
you'll
be
a
great
counselor
dead
body
she
looks
yeah
and
she
borrows
my
clothes
without
asking
hey
um
i'm
in
ceramics
class
with
you
i'm
dawn
summers
i
forgot
if
we
had
an
assignment
last
week
i
spaced
hi
mike
ii'm
sorry
i
didn't
mean
to—
so
um
is
that
any
good
what
do
you
have
to
read
it
for
that's
so
cool
i'd
do
that
but
my
sister'd
be
down
my
neck
in
a
second
no
she's
my
sister
lucky
me
huh
oh
really
what
about
uh
i'm
sorry
that's
none
of
my
business
so
mike's
a
cutie
are
you
guys
going
to
that
dance
oh
i
mean
didn't
he
ask
you
and
you
said
no
we
all
deal
with
death
you
guys
are
way
off
track
i
got
a
hunch
on
this
one
guys
i'm
telling
you
i
got
this
case
cracked
wideopen
i
got
the
perp
fingered
i
told
you
'bout
mike
helgenberg
right
right
the
one
that
keeps
asking
her
to
the
dance
i'm
thinking
who
likes
to
be
rejected
nobody
i'm
thinking
some
people
can't
handle
the
rejection
i'm
thinking
that—
guys
i'm
telling
you
i'm
liking
mike
helgenberg
for
the
perp
let's
collar
him
before
he—
lawyers

mean
let
me
walk
you
home
far

good
what
no
maybe
cassie
she
was
scared
she
wanted
to
help
you
maybe
she
can
she's
not
like
you
think
she's
got
powers
of
helping
and
look
she
was
worried
and
now
i'm
worried
and
i
wasn't
pretending
at
all
i
really
wanted
to
be
your
friend
i
am
i'm
glad
uh
uh
what's
up

such
an
ass

you
tried
she
died
'cause
of
her
heart
not
'cause
of
you
she
was
my
friend
because
of
you
i
guess
sometimes
you
can't
help
