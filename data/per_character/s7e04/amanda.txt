hello
mr
miller
sent
me
here
i'm
not
sure
maybe
'cause
this
guy
was
picking
on
me
insecure
yeah
everyone
says
that
you
know
i'm
really
tired
of
everyone
being
so
insecure
'cause
that's
what
i
did
i
stuck
up
for
myself
the
other
day
after
class
i
jumped
him
in
the
parking
lot
and
i
slammed
his
stupidass
insecure
face
right
into
the
pavement
i
guess
that's
another
reason
mr
miller
wanted
me
to
see
you
do
you
think
i
should
pound
on
him
some
more
