hey
33
minutes
since
when
do
we
go
through
all
this
trouble
for
one
lousy
vampire
excuse
me
one
lousy
potential
vampire
no
no
i'm
sorry
i
wanna
help
i
guess
i've
been
a
bit
stressed
out
lately
i'm
sorry
i
took
it
out
on
you
i
think
you
underestimate
your
familiarity
with
the
world
of
weird
and
tricky
this
job's
perfect
for
you
i
don't
know
amateur
opinion
here
but
she
looks
dead
i
mean
like
natural
causes
dead
maybe
she
cut
herself
shaving
and
then
died
naturally
of
embarrassment
i
bet
she's
giving
them
great
advice
from
beneath
you
it
devours
it's
not
the
friendliest
jingle
is
it
it's
no
i
like
ike
or
milk
it
does
a
body
good
i
think
so
yeah
i
get
that
figuring
out
how
to
control
your
magic
seems
a
lot
like
hammering
a
nail
well
uh
hear
me
out
so
you're
hammering
right
ok
well
at
the
end
of
the
hammer
you
have
the
power
but
no
control
it
takes
like
two
strokes
to
hit
the
nail
in
or
you
could
hit
your
thumb
so
you
choke
up
control
but
no
power
it
could
take
like
ten
strokes
to
knock
the
nail
in
power
control
it's
a
tradeoff
thanks
right
ouch
it'll
take
time
are
you
sure
you're
ready
for
this
so
the
question
is
what
changed
buff
you
spilled
a
cup
of
coffee
i'm
not
saying
you
don't
have
slayer
grace
but
it's
not
the
first
time
let
me
see
that
strep
throat
ear
infections
yeast
infections
none
of
my
business
no
real
info
here
willow
she's
17
a
day
and
a
half
of
researching
and
we
finally
try
looking
up
her
poems
always
a
sign
of
pretentious
inner
turmoil
ok
death
is
really
on
her
brain
this
girl
isn't
just
dealing
she's
giving
death
a
long
sloppy
wordkiss
she
has
a
yen
for
the
big
dirtnap
love
poems
love
poems
a
violent
drunk
yeah
and
buffy
the
counselor
are
you
talking
about
killing
yourself
i
think
she
was
gonna
die
no
matter
what
wasn't
she
didn't
matter
what
you
did
