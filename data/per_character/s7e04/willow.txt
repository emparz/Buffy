absolutely
those
kids
are
lucky
to
have
buffy
looking
out
for
them
i
just
wish
she
believed
it
she's
still
stressing
over
the
whole
dropped
out
of
college
not
actually
qualified
thing
plus
the
salivating
hellmouth
underneath
her
feet
and
the
whole—
i
know
it's
gonna
be
bad
it's
gonna
be
real
bad
and
i
wonder
will
i—
well
if
it
comes—
when
it
comes
will
i
be
able
to
help
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
what
i
can
do
i
mean
frankly
i'm—i'm
scared
of
what
i
might
do
ouch
that's
actually
not
a
bad
analogy
except
i'm
less
worried
about
hitting
my
thumb
and
more
worried
about
going
all
blackeyed
baddy
and
bewitching
that
hammer
into
cracking
my
friends'
skulls
open
like
coconuts

of
precog

hard
to
