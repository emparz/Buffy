on
someone
who's
not

real
slayer
could
you
stop
with
the
slayer
thing
i'm
the
damn
slayer
okay
a
scenario

off
i'll
back
off
but
you
promise
not
to
go
all
wiggy
until
we
can
go
to
my
watcher
and
figure
this
out
you
know
no
kicko
no
fighto
so
you
were
sent
here
to
do
what
exactly
what
so
he's
a
real
guy
as
in
nonfictional
we
got
that
part
hon
he
means
your
name
can
you
say
'stuck
in
the
80's'
back
off
pink
ranger

is
my
friend
yeah
as
in
person

a
really
big
mixup

a
minute
just
a
little
what's
the
flum
it's
a
mistake
she
isn't
supposed
to
be
here
she
goes
home
look
no
offense
i
really
don't
mean
this
personally
but
i'm
not
dead
and
frankly
having
you
around
creeps
me
out
just
a
little
bit
and
what's
your
great
plan
for
finding
this
dark
power
you
just
gonna
attack
people
randomly
till
you
find
a
bad
one
then
why
the
hell
did
you
attack
me
oh
a
swing
and
a
miss
for
the
rookie
yes
right
look
you
saw
me
with
angel
and
he
is
a
vampire
but
he's
good
he
had
a
gypsy
curse
y'know
what
just
trust
me
on
this
one
okay
he's
on
the
home
team
now
when
you
what
what
did
you
do
to
him
what
did
you
do
angel
what
yeah
i
know
the
drill
and
i
don't
need
to
kill
you
doesn't
anyone
just
say
'hello'
where
you
come
from
that's
really
good
for
you
percepto
girl
but
we're
not
gonna
get
anything
out
of
him
if
he's
oh
say
unconscious
where's
angel
where'd
he
go
are
you
telling
me
the
truth
i
don't
take
orders
i
do
things
my
way
let's
go
oh
that'll
be
a
treat
ooo
good
plan
let's
go
charge
it's
a
little
more
complicated
than
that
john
wayne
um
how
do
you
know
all
this
so
obviously
you
have
a
lot
of
free
time
wait
handbook
what
handbook
how
come
i
don't
have
a
handbook
well
what
do
you
mean
it
would
be
of
no
use
in
my
case
wha
what's
wrong
with
my
case
hello
and
welcome
to
planet
pocket
protector
eee
career
fair
right
get
a
load
of
the
shegiles
ew
i'll
bet
giles
wishes
i
was
more
of
a
book
geek
yeah
but
did
you
see
how
they
were
vibing
volume
six
ha
ha
ha
i
wonder
no
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
so
bad
being
replaced
maybe
i
mean
maybe
after
this
thing
with
spike
and
the
assassins
is
over
i
could
say
'kendra
you
slay
i'm
going
to
disneyland'
willow
but
not
forever
right
no
disneyland
would
get
boring
after
a
few
months
but
i
could
do
other
stuff
career
day
stuff
maybe
i
could
even
have
a
normal
life
my
tests
say
that
i
should
look
into
law
enforcement

duh

and
environmental
design
i
checked
the
'shrub'
box
but
landscaping
was
yesterday
so
law
enforcement
it
is
hey
will
don't
look
okay
but
no
don't
look
that
guy
over
there
is
totally
checking
you
out
really
then
why
is
he
on
his
way
over
here
right
now
told
you
get
down
how
is
he
she
was
definitely
one
of
the
taraka
gang
giles
and
way
gun
happy
down
girl
just
say
hello
xander
you
and
bug
people
xander
what's
up
with
that
these
taraka
are
definitely
serious
fortunately
for
me
so
is
kendra
they
need
drusilla's
sire
you
mean
the
vamp
that
made
her
angel
he's
drusilla's
sire
will
this
ritual
kill
him
we
need
to
find
this
church
we
need
to
find
where
this
ritual
is
gonna
take
place
look
you've
got
your
priorities
and
i've
got
mine
right
now
they
mesh
so
are
you
gonna
help
me
or
are
you
gonna
get
out
of
my
way
good
'cause
i've
had
it
spike
is
going
down
you
can
attack
me
you
can
send
assassins
after
me
that's
fine
but
nobody
messes
with
my
boyfriend
yep
nope
must
be
in
the
handbook
right
after
the
chapter
on
personality
removal
be
careful
with
that
thing
yeah
it's
okay
kendra
killed
the
bad
lamp
when
this
is
over
i'm
thinking
pineapple
pizza
and
teen
video
movie
fest
possibly
something
from
the
ringwald
oeuvre
you
mean
the
part
where
i
occasionally
have
one
yeah
i
guess
it
is
even
family
how
young
i
don't
know
i
i
guess
it
just
sounds
very
lonely
kendra
my
emotions
give
me
power
they're
total
assets
mm
i
guess
that
explains
it
oh
well
when
we
were
fighting
uh
you're
amazing
your
technique
it's
flawless
it's
hmm
better
than
mine
still
i
woulda
kicked
your
butt
in
the
end
and
ya
know
why
no
imagination
oh
i
know
so
you're
good
but
power
alone
isn't
enough
a
good
fighter
needs
to
know
how
to
improvise
to
go
with
the
flow
uhuh
seriously
don't
get
me
wrong
yyou
really
do
have
potential
that
would
be
anger
you're
feeling
you
feel
it
right
how
the
anger
gives
you
fire
a
slayer
needs
that
i'm
guessing
dating
isn't
big
with
your
watcher
either
unless
you're
pummeling
them
wait
a
minute
that
guy
the
sleazoid
you
nearly
decked
in
the
bar
i
tink
we
might
make
him
what
about
this
ritual
what
have
you
heard
she
likes
to
hit
let's
go
excuse
me
while
we
run
to
giles
this
whole
thing
could
go
down
it's
brainless
you
mean
if
we
don't
go
now
angel
could
die
no
it's
not
all
but
it's
enough
are
you
listening
to
me
he
could
die
angel
what's
that
it's
your
lucky
day
spike
no
waiting
switch
mutual
