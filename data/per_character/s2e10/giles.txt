and
your
watcher
is
iis
sam
zabuto
you
say
we've
never
met
but
he
he's
he's
very
wellrespected
and
you
are
called
buffy
please
uh
there's
obviously
some
some
misunderstanding
here
uhuh
kendra
uh
there
are
aaa
few
people
uh
cicivilians
if
you
like
who
who
know
buffy's
identity
willow
is
one
of
them
aa
and
they
also
um
spend
time
together
uh
socially
well
uh
of
course
uh
but
uh
with
buffy
however
itit's
um
some
flexibility
is
required
uh
it
seems
somehow
that
uh
another
slayer
has
been
sent
to
sunnydale
not
to
my
knowledge
um
ththe
new
slayer
is
only
called
after
the
previous
slayer
has
died
uh
oh
good
lord
you
were
dead
buffy
clearly
it
doesn't
matter
how
long
you
were
gone
you
were
physically
dead
thus
causing
the
activation
of
the
the
next
slayer
she
drowned
but
she
was
revived
it
would
seem
so
this
is
completely
unprecedented
i'm
quite
flummoxed
no
no
no
he's
he's
good
now
kendra
ii've
uh
conferred
with
your
watcher
mr
zabuto
and
uh
we
both
agree
that
uh
until
this
matter
with
spike
and
drusilla
has
been
resolved
that
you
two
should
work
together
yes
well
iiii
think
that's
the
uh
the
dark
power
that
your
your
watcher
rereferred
to
you
see
uh
you
see
drusilla's
not
only
evil
she's
uh
well
she's
also
quite
mad
andandandand
if
she's
restored
to
her
full
health
then
uh
well
there's
no
absolutely
no
telling
what
she
might
do
buffy
yes
i'm
i'm
afraid
it
is
you
see
spike
has
also
called
out
the
order
of
taraka
to
keep
buffy
out
of
the
way
oh
really
wwwhich
volume
after
meeting
you
buffy
i
realized
that
uh
the
handbook
would
be
of
no
use
in
your
case
uh
kendra
um
perhaps
you'd
like
to
show
me
the
the
part
in
uh
dramius
six
where
uh
uh
where
it
refers
to
the
order
of
taraka
really
ii
i
seem
to
have
never
been
able
to
get
through
that
book
it
was
a
bit
stodgy
oh
well
bbuffy
principal
snyder
was
snooping
round
after
you
best
make
an
appearance
i
think
yes
oh
no
well
aaactually
she
had
to
give
up
her
cheerleading
uh
it
was
quite
an
amusing
story
actually
this
um
oz
chap
he
he
he's
alright
we
had
a
a
rather
violent
visit
from
the
order
of
taraka
oh
forgive
me
uh
xander
cordelia
this
is
kendra
uh
iit's
rather
complicated
but
she's
also
a
slayer
xander
um
this
this
uh
assassin
you
encountered
what
uh
what
did
he
look
like
the
uh
thethethe
important
thing
is
everybody's
alright
still
it's
quite
apparent
that
we're
under
serious
attack
and
uh
i
fear
the
worst
is
still
to
come
i've
ii've
discovered
the
remaining
keys
to
drusilla's
cure
the
uh
the
ritual
requires
that
the
presence
of
her
sire
and
it
must
take
place
in
a
church
on
the
night
of
the
new
moon
exactly
and
ii'm
sure
the
assassins
were
here
to
kill
buffy
before
she
could
put
a
stop
to
things
yes
yes
i'm
afraid
it
will
agreed
and
we
must
work
quickly
we
have
five
hours
before
sundown
there
are
fortythree
churches
in
sunnydale
that
seems
a
little
excessive
well
check
and
see
if
any
of
them
are
closed
or
abandoned
well
you
should
have
better
luck
with
this
one
there's
a
whole
section
devoted
to
the
order
of
taraka
is
everything
alright
