'one
night
after
supper
the
lead
dog
turned
up
a
snowshoe
rabbit
the
dog
lay
down
low
to
the
race
his
body
flashing
forward
leap
by
leap'
cut
to
the
library
buffy's
voice
dissolves
into
that
of
willow
who
is
walking
around
the
area
by
the
cage
while
reading
from
the
book
no
there's
a
smooch
spot
up
by
the
woods
that's
usually
where
kids
go
hardly
only
been
on
a
few
dates
yeah
i
guess
but
how
low
how
about
not
but
he
is
blueberry
that
crunchy
munchy
stuff
on
top
but
my
most
favorite
thing
so
far
is
that
he
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
kind
of
hell
beast
okay
i
was
hoping
to
not
get
that
cynical
till
i
was
at
least
forty
i
know
it
is
an
awful
generalization
okay
hey
we
have
a
marching
jazz
band
those
are
pretty
flowers
no
we're
preposy
definitely
what
time
is
it
oh
i
have
to
go
see
mr
platt
today
i
get
to
convince
him
that
i'm
little
miss
stable
so
i
can
stay
in
school
we'd
better
go
i'll
see
you
buffy
summers
reporting
for
sanity
look
i
know
that
i
have
to
do
this
and
ii'll
cooperate
and
i'll
look
at
your
ink
blots
and
everything
but
i
don't
wanna
talk
about
my
life
or
my
childhood
or
anything
for
that
matter
actually
and
uh
i
don't
wanna
be
friends
here
not
too
crazy
those
are
your
credentials
gotta
say
i'm
with
you
on
that
that's
a
long
story
you
know
i'm
i'm
really
over
it
ii'm
moving
on
i
feel
good
i'm
i'm
even
dating
someone
new
i
was
dating
someone
uh
itit
ended
badly
my
mom
and
i
were
fighting
and
i
kinda
freaked
he
was
my
first
i
loved
him
and
then
he
yeah
yes
and
if
you
can't
i'm
afraid
to
ask
it's
okay
we'll
work
together
and
we'll
figure
this
out
oh
uh
bleeding
internally
but
i'll
live
figured
as
much
ow
again
uh
actually
iii
came
to
give
you
the
rest
of
the
night
off
couldn't
sleep
figured
i'd
uh
cram
for
my
french
test
knock
yourself
out
not
literally
though
hey
oh
boy
faith
and
her
nutty
books
yeah
and
she
still
listens
to
heavy
metal
freaky
deaky
what
if
i
told
you
that
i
had
a
dream
about
angel
and
um
it
brought
up
some
questions
i
dreamt
that
he
came
back
this
was
vivid
really
vivid
threedimensional
sensurround
the
hills
are
alive
no
ii
don't
know
i
i
guess
it
just
it
made
me
wonder
is
there
a
chance
even
could
it
happen
let's
just
pretend
for
a
second
that
angel
somehow
found
his
way
back
to
sunnydale
what
would
he
be
like
i
remember
so
he
would've
been
down
there
for
hundreds
of
years
of
torture
a
lost
cause
and
the
second
type
oh
hey
change
of
plans
couldn't
sleep
huh
yeah
uh
what
happened
with
the
inspection
of
the
body
willow
come
on
was
it
werewolf
was
it
a
vampire
how
could
it
not
be
conclusive
what
did
it
look
like
was
he
bit
no
it's
just
i'm
sorry
hey
oh
my
stomach
doesn't
want
hard
food
today
but
there's
fruit
in
it
oh
i'm
i'm
really
out
of
it
today
i
didn't
sleep
well
last
night
i
kinda
liked
him
oh
he
definitely
marches
to
the
beat
of
his
own
drummer
a
actually
i
think
he
makes
his
own
drums
uh
that's
really
sweet
um
and
ii
wish
i
didn't
have
to
but
i
just
remembered
that
i
do
so
uh
i'll
see
you
later
angel
do
you
understand
me
two
o'clock
buffy
summers
right
wait
don't
turn
around
okay
and
don't
say
anything
just
listen
i
mean
that's
that's
your
thing
right
there's
something
going
on
i
mean
ththis
whole
entire
story
is
probably
gonna
convince
you
that
i'm
loonybin
material
but
there's
nobody
else
that
i
can
talk
to
not
willow
and
not
giles
nobody
if
they
if
they
found
out
they'd
freak
on
me
or
they'd
do
something
and
i
need
help
i
just
i
need
to
talk
to
someone
i'm
so
scared
he's
come
back
it's
okay
will
we're
all
glad
oz
is
off
the
hook
and
we
know
that
debbie
knew
platt
i
mean
she
was
seeing
him
and
way
vocal
about
not
having
love
for
the
guy
no
platt
was
dead
in
an
instant
he
didn't
even
drop
his
cigarette
now
what
if
boyfriend
pete's
the
one
doling
out
the
punishment
it's
tricky
covering
a
fresh
shiner
like
that
you
know
what
works
don't
get
hit
what's
going
on
debbie
i'll
bet
the
farm
you
know
normally
i'd
say
you
wanna
play
'i
have
a
secret'
fine
but
people
are
dying
here
you
mean
pete
pete's
not
like
other
guys
is
he
debbie
you
have
to
talk
to
us
we
can't
help
you
until
you
do
debbie
we're
running
out
of
time
where
can
we
find
him
you're
lying
look
at
yourself
why
are
you
protecting
him
anybody
who
really
loved
you
couldn't
do
this
to
you
probably
great
so
what
you
two
live
out
your
grimm
fairy
tale
two
people
are
dead
who's
gonna
be
next
this
is
useless
we
have
to
go
i
have
to
find
pete
i
think
she
was
broken
before
this
got
it
oh
sorry
you
get
the
wolf
oh
god
that's
better
than
the
estrogen
theory
i
heard
he
took
all
of
his
mother's
birth
control
pills
the
only
thing
was
after
a
while
he
didn't
need
the
potion
to
turn
into
a
bad
guy
he
did
it
just
fine
on
his
own
just
himself
uh
i'll
see
you
guys
later
i
don't
know
what
to
say
that's
not
gonna
sound
stupid
or
obvious
is
there
anything
i
can
do
'night
came
on
and
a
full
moon
rose
high
over
the
trees'
cut
to
the
mansion
buffy
watches
as
angel
lies
asleep
on
the
floor
'lighting
the
land
till
it
lay
bathed
in
ghostly
day
and
the
strain
of
the
primitive
remained
alive
and
active'
cut
to
her
the
camera
closes
in
on
her
'faithfulness
and
devotion
things
born
of
fire
and
roof
were
his'
cut
to
angel
he
moves
slightly
and
his
face
contorts
in
anguish
and
pain
as
he
dreams
'yet
he
retained
his
wildness
and
wiliness'
cut
to
buffy
she
is
sitting
on
the
floor
leaning
against
the
wall
watching
him
sleep
and
contemplating
her
life
'and
from
the
depths
of
the
forest
a
call
still
sounded'
