we
need
to
recheck
every
possible
exit
avenue
right
it's
good
to
see
you
um
no
need
to
panic
now
uh
bear
in
mind
uh
most
likely
there
there
there
is
no
deal
but
um
if
if
if
there
was
a
deal
then
it
um
would
concern
murder
last
night
a
male
student
was
was
found
iiin
the
woods
jeff
orkin
i'm
afraid
he
was
he
was
um
terribly
mauled
now
uh
much
as
i
hate
to
think
it
iiit
could
be
the
handiwork
of
of
how
long
exactly
did
you
woke
up
no
oz
may
have
got
out
of
his
cage
last
night
perhaps
perhaps
it's
something
else
entirely
yes
um
buffy
uh
you
uh
you
patrol
the
woods
um
well
i
have
some
research
materials
at
home
i
need
to
look
up
uh
wwwe
could
ask
faith
to
watch
over
him
hmm
hello
'exploring
demon
dimensions'
and
'mystery
of
acathla'
buffy
i'd
say
it
was
to
be
expected
must
have
been
some
dream
i
didn't
think
you
knew
what
a
card
index
was
for
of
course
after
jenny
was
killed
i
had
dreams
that
she
was
sstill
alive
that
i
saved
her
do
you
believe
it
was
a
prophecy
well
there's
no
record
of
anyone
returning
from
a
demon
dimension
once
the
gate
was
closed
iii
can't
imagine
how
it
could
happen
oror
why
i
really
can't
say
from
what
is
known
about
that
dimension
i
it
would
suggest
a
world
of
brutal
torment
and
time
moves
quite
differently
there
so
yes
it
would
take
someone
of
extraordinary
will
and
character
to
survive
that
and
uh
retain
any
semblance
of
self
most
likely
he'd
be
be
a
monster
maybe
maybe
not
in
my
experience
there
are
two
types
of
monster
the
first
uh
can
be
redeemed
or
more
importantly
wants
to
be
redeemed
the
second
is
void
of
humanity
cannot
respond
to
reason
or
love
let
her
finish
buffy
this
creature
is
especially
brutal
i
believe
the
phrase
coined
by
the
coroner
when
describing
mr
platt
was
'pureed'
but
he
did
confirm
that
platt
was
killed
shortly
before
buffy
found
him
indeed
shouldn't
he
be
here
by
now
the
sun
sets
at
530
our
task
now
is
to
determine
what
sort
of
killer
we
are
dealing
with
clearly
we're
looking
for
a
depraved
sadistic
animal
uh
i
wish
we
had
time
to
celebrate
properly
however
we
have
two
victims
jeff
orkin
and
uh
now
platt
uh
maybe
there's
something
they
had
in
common
besides
that
we
should
find
them
both
immediately
all
right
we'll
split
up
um
faith
you
and
i
team
willow
stick
with
buffy
what
was
that
get
the
dart
gun
ow
oh
right
bloody
priceless
