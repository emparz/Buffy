'he
was
sounding
the
deeps
of
his
nature
and
the
parts
of
his
nature
that
were
deeper
than
he
going
back
into
the
wombs
of
time
the
rabbit
could
not'
suddenly
werewolf
oz
leaps
up
against
the
cage
door
and
rattles
it
at
her
she
startles
and
steps
back
okay
uh
maybe
we
should
try
a
less
stimulating
passage
xander
oh
good
some
of
us
are
anyway
it'll
help
you
stay
awake
it's
good
and
and
very
wolfy
seems
to
soothe
the
savage
beast
except
for
the
parts
about
rabbits
it
seems
to
make
him
a
little
overexcited
okay
now
he's
had
his
200
feeding
and
uh
after
sunrise
if
he
forgets
where
his
clothes
are
they're
on
top
of
the
file
cabinet
in
his
cage
i
put
those
towels
up
for
privacy
mm

for
me

more
manageable

the
third
night
tomorrow

total
full
moon

when
he's
a
real
wolfer
