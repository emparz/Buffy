more
important
things

look
we're
not
accusing
you
of
anything
it's
just

you
were
kind
of
taking
it
personal
down
there
you
sure
actually

not
everything
i
uh
might
have

kept
one
or
or
two
things
sort
of
just
in
case
it
won't
take
long
i
can't
you
don't
know
how
much
i
hate
this
i
don't
know
if
there's
even

anything
i
could
do
no
i
can't
if
i
start
i

i
might
not
be
able
to
stop
thanks

for
before
and
and
for
taking
this
stuff
with
you
just
so
you
know
ii
was
never

gonna
use
it
i
mean
not
really
i

i
just
kept
it
like
a
safety
net
'cause

there
was
always
this

thing
in
the
back
of
my
head
this
you
know
voice
saying
like
'what
if
things
get
bad
i
mean
really
bad
and
what
if
you
can't
handle
it'
aand
it
made
me
panic
so

that's
why
i
kept
a
couple
of
things
i

kept
them
so
ii
didn't
have
to
think
about
it
so
i
could
focus
on

on
getting
better
