just
a
followup
after
your

your
loss
and
since
i'm
new
here
i
thought
it
would
give
us
a
chance
to
know
each
other
so
i've
been
looking
through
your
file
and
um

your
grades
have
slipped
a
little
yeah
still
teachers
say
that
you
seem
a
little
distracted
lately
okay
it's
just
you
know
i
know
it
must
seem
weird
talking
to
a
stranger
about
stuff
but
um

i
want
you
to
know
that
if
something's
going
on
something's
up
my
job

the
most
important
part
of
my
job

is
looking
out
for
you
i
know
there's
been

a
lot
of
loss
