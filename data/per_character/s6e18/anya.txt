have
what
been
able
to
stop
the
wedding

of
an
eitheror
deal

you
want
to
get
married
yes
honesty

on
being
honest
now
i
wonder
what
the
medal
will
say
well
duh
and
i
wish
you
were
never
born
i
wish
you
felt
the
pain
of
a
thousand
searing
pokers
boiling
your
heart
in
its
own
juices
i

i
wish
you
had
tentacles
where
your
beady
eyes
should
be
i
wish
your
intestines
were
tied
in
knots
and
ripped
apart
inside
your
lousy
gut
really
right
now
does
it
hurt
those
are
metaphor
intestines
you're
not
in
any
real
pain
what's
wrong
with
me
hmm
i'm
sorry
i
know
i'm
just
distracted
yeah
i
am
the
wronged
party
here
of
course
i
halfrek
you
can't
exact
justice
against
someone
on
behalf
of
yourself
silly
how
long
have
you
been
away
i
haven't
been
scorned
by
a
man
in
like
a
thousand
years
i
never
had
to
make
a
wish
for
myself
there
has
to
be
some
way
around
that
hi
yeah
sorry
i
needed
to
you
know

i
couldn't
stay
here
not
after

everything
that
happened
it's
complicated
you
know
and
there's
a
lot
to
deal
with
let's
talk
about
xander
you
think
it's
anywhere
close
to
what
i
feel
and
men
really
like
to
watch
that
kind
of
stuff
don't
they
men
like
xander
let's
test
that
theory
coagulate
oh
wish
as
in
'i
wish
xander'
dawn
right
that
word
there's
vengeance
demons
out
there
that
are
still
active
remember
any
'i
wish'
could
totally
end
in
horrible
grossness
gimme
a
forinstance
did
i
mention
the
whole
'left
at
the
altar'
thing
didn't
leave
that
out
did
i
okay
let's
talk
about
torture
so
tell
me
more
about
wishing
xander's
brains
and
guts
would
go
blooey
yes
you
did
i
heard
you
didn't
say
what
oh
right
the
mad
thieving
good
yes
there
's
much
to
do
i'm
gonna
put
you
to
work
missy
so
back
to
xander's
brains
and
guts
squish
squish
squish
guys
have
been
running
roughshod
over
you
for
years
torturing
that
perky
little
ticker
aren't
you
sick
of
it
don't
you
wish
guys
like
that
buffy
whoa
guys
there
have
only
been
four

three
three
three
guys
that's
barely
plural
and
didn't
each
of
them
rip
your
heart
out
don't
men
like
that
as
to
pick
an
example
xander
deserve
to
be
punished
we're
comforting
me
it
just
it
hurts
he
hurt
me
so
much
well
congratulations
they
all
still
love
you
even
after
what
you
did
to
me
no
they're
all
'oh
poor
xander
it
took
so
much
out
of
him
all
that
running
away
he
did'
i
just
don't
understand
what's
wrong
with
these
people
well
but
halfrek
do
you
want
retribution
anyanka
i
want
xander
good
and
cursed
get
a
wish
from
someone
who
doesn't
freaking
love
him
yeah
but
my
social
circle
is
a
little
limited
here
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
just
stumble
upon
someone
who
doesn't
give
a
fig's
ass
if
xander
gets
hurt
so
what's
your
pleasure
uh
huh
hang
on
oh
my
god
spike
hates
xander
maybe
i
could
get
him
to
wish

dammit
if
only
he
were
a
woman
got
it
if
i
can
somehow
get
someone
to
wish
that
spike
were
a
woman
then
i
could
go
to
him

well
he'd
be
a
her
by
then

then
i
could
go
to
her

halfrek
anyanka
there's
an
easier
way
now
i
know
you
have
this
whole
femalepower
take
back
the
night
thing
i
think
that's
cute
but
i've
been
telling
you
for
decades

men
need
a
little
vengeance
now
and
then
too
oh
that's
okay
i'm
ready
to
do
some
business
actually
yes
um
giles
left
a
couple
of
supplies
here
and
i
think

this
might
help
eases
the
hurt

makes
the
sun
shine
a
little
brighter
even
makes
boring
people
seem
more
interesting
ah
here
but
he
made
a
fool
of
me
and
nobody
seems
to
care
enough
to
do
anything
but
shouldn't
he
pay
don't
you
wish
he
had
to
pay
in
some
horrible
way
right
so

hypothetically
what
do
you
wish
you
could
do
to
him
thing
about
it
is
none
of
this
was
my
idea
i
didn't
ask
to
be
human
to
tell
you
the
truth

all
i
wanted
was
to
use
him
and
lose
him
i
hadn't
had
a
good
tumble
in
a
thousand
years
yeah

and
he
was

all
bumpy

in
the
right
places
and
nice
to
me
next
thing
you
know

i'm
changing
to
please
him
i
care
if
he
cares
and
i'm
off
my
guard
happy
i'm
singing
in
the
shower
and
doing
my
sexy
dance
screw
'em
i
did
everything
for
that
man
was
it
ever
enough
me
either
i
hate
us
everybody's
so
nice
nobody
says
what's
on
their
mind
really
mm
xander
didn't
think
so
he
thought
i
was
rude
you
think
thank
you
no

thank
you
this
is
the
first
time
since

it
feels
good
to
be
with
someone
who
understands
this
whole
time
i've
been
coming
on
all

hellbent
and
mad
wanting
his
head
you
know
when
really
i

can't
sleep
at
night
thinking
it

has
to
be
my
fault
somehow
what
if
it
was
just
pretending
what
if
he
never
wanted
me

the
way
i
wanted
him
ohh
i'm
sorry
then
why
too
hot
to
handle
um

justjust
one
more
question
can
i
see
your
sexy
dance
wait
wait
what
are
we
doing
you
know
i'm
only
doing
this
'cause
i'm

i'm
lonely
and
drunk
and
you

smell
really
good
xander
no
stop
it
stop
it
stop
it
xander
i
how
it
was
just
it

it
was
just
a
thing
i

i
felt
bad
and
he
was
just

there
and
then
you
weren't
you
left
me
xander
at
the
altar
i
don't
owe
you
anything
where
do
you
get
off
judging
me
no
the
mature
solution
is
for
you
to
spend
your
whole
life
telling
stupid
pointless
jokes
so
that
no
one
will
notice
that
you
are
just
a
scared
insecure
little
boy
buffy
