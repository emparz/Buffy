the
camera
looks
straight
down
from
above
onto
the
cobblestones
a
lone
rider
on
his
horse
passes
underneath
and
the
camera
follows
them
past
a
well
as
angelus
narrates
the
horseman
continues
past
a
tavern
on
the
far
side
of
the
square
the
door
opens
and
a
young
drunk
angel
and
his

are
thrown
out

on
it
a

of
times

friend
moans
angel
staggers
back
over
to
him
and
puts
his
arm
around

they
begin
to
walk
with
a
definite
sway
in
their
step
he'll
never
miss
it
he
eats
with
his
hands
the
pig
his
friend
is
too
drunk
to
go
on
and
faints
dead
away
falling
out
of
angel's
arm
to
the
pavement
angel
looks
down
at
him
he
takes
a
look
around
and
spots
a
noble
lady
in
a
fancy
period
dress
standing
in
an
alley
beyond
an
archway
the
woman
gives
a
slight
backward
glance
to
be
sure
she
has
his
attention
and
starts
to
walk
further
into
the
alley
disappearing
around
a
corner
from
angel's
view
he
follows
her
darla
still
facing
away
darla
turns
to
face
him
angel
approaches
her
he
stops
in

of
her
and
looks
into
her
eyes
darla
smiles
darla
smiles
darla
closes
her
eyes
angel
follows
her
example
the
camera
follows
her
hand
as
she
puts
it
on
his
shoulder
and
continues
up
to
show
her
face
vamped
out
she
smiles
lets
out
a
low
growl
and
opens
wide
as
she
leans
in
to
bite
him
when
he
feels
the
pain
his
eyes
open
wide
and
he
gasps
he
can't
keep
steady
and
sinks
to
his
knees
darla
lets
go
of
her
bite
revealing
his
bloody
neck
and
stands
up
straight
she
lifts
her
hand
to
her
chest
and
draws
a
sharp
fingernail
across
the
skin
above
her
breasts
allowing
blood
to
trickle
out
she
grabs
him
by
the
back
of
the
neck
and
pulls
him
in
to
her
bosom
so
that
his
lips
fall
directly
onto
the
cut
forcing
him
to
taste
of
her
blood
he
puts
his
arms
around
her
and
drinks
the
other
one
comes
at
her
again
with
a
swing
she
ducks
it
and
punches
him
in
the
face
in
the
gut
and
again
in
the
face
he
falls
to
the
ground
dazed
the
first
one
comes
at
her
again
with
a
kick
but
she
blocks
it
with
her
arm
backhand
punches
him
in
the
face
jabs
him
in
the
gut
and
grabs
his
arm
twisting
it
up
high
and
forcing
him
to
his
knees
in
pain
angelus
looks
on
from
behind
a
tree
and
smiles
the
second
vampire
gets
back
up
and
rushes
her
without
letting
go
of
the
first
one
she
cleanly
jams
her
stake
into
the
other
one's
chest
and
he
crumbles
into
ashes
angelus
can't
help
but
snicker
buffy
turns
her
attention
back
to
the
one
she's
holding
and
punches
him
in
the
face
making
him
roll
away

smiles
as
he
listens

vampire
gets
up
and
charges
her

and

around
and
down
to

stake
home

bursts
into
ashes

them
the
whispering
seems
to
be
coming
from

and
stares
at
it
sadly
for
a
moment
she
