god
are
you
disgusting
this
is
really
an
unforgettable
smell
this
is
the
stench
of
death
you're
giving
off
here
and
the
look
says
uh
crazy
homeless
guy
it's
not
good
what
are
you
gonna
do
bite
me
ah
but
you
wouldn't
bite
me
on
account
of
your
poor
tortured
soul
it's
so
sad
a
vampire
with
a
soul
it's
so
poignant
let's
take
a
walk
what
are
you
eating
like
a
rat
once
a
month
hey
look
you're
skin
and
bones
here
butcher
shops
are
throwing
away
more
blood
in
a
day
than
you
could
stand
good
blood
you
lived
in
the
world
a
little
bit
you'd
know
that
and
i
wanna
know
who
you
are
not
yet
but
i'm
looking
to
find
out
'cause
you
could
go
either
way
here
nobody
understands
me
that's
my
curse
dog
me
mustard
my
name's
whistler
thanks
a
demon
technically
i
mean
i'm
not
a
bad
guy
not
all
demons
are
dedicated
to
the
destruction
of
all
life
i
mean
that
you
can
become
an
even
more
useless
rodent
than
you
already
are
or
you
can
become
someone
a
person
someone
to
be
counted
well
yeah
you've
been
left
alone
for
what
ninety
years
already
and
what
a
package
you
are
the
stink
guy
i
want
you
to
see
something
we'd
have
to
leave
now
you
see
and
then
you
tell
me
what
you
wanna
do
she's
gonna
have
it
tough
that
slayer
she's
just
a
kid
the
world's
full
of
big
bad
things
god
jeez
look
at
you
she
must
be
prettier
than
the
last
slayer
this
isn't
gonna
be
easy
the
more
you
live
in
this
world
the
more
you
see
how
apart
from
it
you
really
are
and
this
is
dangerous
work
right
now
you
couldn't
go
three
rounds
with
a
fruit
fly
alright
again
you're
annoying
me
you're
lucky
we
need
you
on
our
side
bottom
line
is
even
if
you
see
'em
coming
you're
not
ready
for
the
big
moments
no
one
asks
for
their
life
to
change
not
really
but
it
does
so
what
are
we
helpless
puppets
no
the
big
moments
are
gonna
come
you
can't
help
that
it's
what
you
do
afterwards
that
counts
that's
when
you
find
out
who
you
are
you'll
see
what
i
mean
