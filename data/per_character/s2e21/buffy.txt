want
you
to
get
a
message
to
angel
for
me

him
i'm
done
waiting

taking
the
fight
to
him

that
need

i
haven't
even
started
studying
for
finals
yet
ah
look
on
the
bright
side
it'll
all
be
over
soon
that's
exactly
how
it
happened
the
theme
is
angel's
too
much
of
a
coward
to
take
me
on
faceto
face
i
wish
people
would
stop
asking
me
that
yes
i'm
ready
i'm
also
willing
and
able
just
the
one
test
i
might
actually
pass
ready
to
rock
yeah
where
they
teach
lunch
sums
it
up
maybe
ii
do
have
to
patrol
no
i
don't
expect
him
to
but
that's
usually
when
he
does
waah
this
doesn't
make
any
sense
it's
senseless
yay
me
well
it
doesn't
matter
anyway
i
mean
when
in
the
real
world
am
i
ever
gonna
need
chemistry
or
history
or
math
or
the
english
language
i'm
a
moron
wow
you
really
are
a
good
teacher
ohh
hold
that
thought
okay
i'm
learn
girl
deja
vu
yeah
i
have
this
perfect
memory
of
the
pencil
and
oh
hey
you
dropped
this
this
feels
kinda
morbid
does
that
make
it
less
morbid
or
you
really
morbid
relax
will
i
was
making
with
the
funny
does
that
say
'restoration'
willow
the
curse
this
is
it
well
she
tried
anyway
and
it
looks
like
it
might
have
worked
i
don't
want
you
putting
yourself
in
any
danger
will
i
care
it's
not
that
simple
stop
it
stop
it
ii
don't
know
what
happened
to
angel
wasn't
his
fault
well
i'll
do
a
couple
of
sweeps
and
then
i'll
stop
by
yeah
xander
was
pretty
much
being
a
willow
where
did
you
learn
that
word
my
god
you
kiss
your
mother
with
that
mouth
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
what
i
wanna
do
i'll
i'll
see
you
in
a
little
while
okay
you
know
polite
people
call
before
they
jump
out
of
the
bushes
and
attack
you
how
about
testing
my
facepunching
'cause
i
think
you'll
find
it's
improved
which
begs
the
question
and
don't
think
i'm
not
glad
to
see
you
but
why
are
you
here
oh
wait
no
let
me
guess
your
watcher
informed
you
dat
a
very
dark
power
is
about
to
rise
in
sunnydale
great
so
you
have
any
idea
what
this
dark
power
is
and
you're
sure
this
was
the
tomb
of
alfalfa
so
that
would
be
the
literal
kind
of
'sucked
into
hell'
neat
willow
i
think
you
should
try
the
curse
oh
i'll
fight
him
i'll
kill
him
if
i
have
to
but
if
i
don't
get
there
in
time
or
if
i
lose
then
willow
might
be
our
only
hope
ah
i'll
wing
it
of
course
if
we
go
to
hell
by
then
i
won't
have
to
take
'em
or
maybe
i'll
be
taking
them
forever
so
i'm
like
'dad
do
you
want
me
to
go
to
the
dance
in
an
outfit

already
worn
