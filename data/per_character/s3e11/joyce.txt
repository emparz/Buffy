i
keep
thinking
about
who

everybody
i
know
in
town
i
told

setting
up

this
is
not
a
good
town
how
many
of
us
have
have
lost
someone
who
who
just
disappeared
or
or
got
skinned
or
suffered
neck
rupture
and
how
many
of
us
have
been
too
afraid
to
speak
out
ii
was
supposed
to
lead
us
in
a
moment
of
silence
but
silence
is
this
town's
disease
for
too
long
wewe've
been
plagued
by
unnatural
evils
this
isn't
our
town
anymore
i
say
it's
time
for
the
grownups
to
take
sunnydale
back
i
say
we
start
by
finding
the
people
who
did
this
and
making
them
pay
i
don't
want
you
seeing
that
willow
anymore
i've
spoken
with
her
mother
i
had
no
idea
her
forays
into
the
occult
had
gone
so
far
honey
they
opened
a
few
lockers
he'll
get
most
of
them
back
moo
just
wants
to
weed
out
the
offensive
material
everything
else
will
be
returned
to
mr
giles
soon
sweetie
those
books
have
no
place
in
a
public
school
library
especially
now
any
student
can
waltz
in
there
and
get
all
sorts
of
ideas
do
you
understand
how
that
terrifies
me
but
is
it
really
i
mean
you
patrol
you
slay
evil
pops
up
you
undo
it
aaand
that's
great
but
is
sunnydale
getting
any
better
it's
not
your
fault
you
don't
have
a
plan
you
just
react
to
things
iiit's
bound
to
be
kind
of
fruitless
buffy
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
mean
to
put
down
just
trying
to
make
things
better
did
you
speak
to
the
families
on
sycamore
street

easy
good
morning
sleepyhead
since
when
does
it
matter
what
i
want

been
such
a
champ

should
stay
close

with
unnatural
forces

of
a
mother
