iii
only
meant
i'm
sorry
i
i
just
want
to
help
do
we
know
how
uh
it
wasn't
a
vampire
oh
uh
12th
century
papal
encyclical
write
on
this
hmm
what
oh
sorry
um
no
it
i
just
wonder
if
we're
looking
for
a
thing
the
use
of
a
symbol
ooon
a
victim
like
this
suggests
a
a
ritual
murder
and
a
cult
sacrifice
by
a
group
yes
i'm
afraid
so
buffy
this
is
a
dreadful
crime
i
know
and
you
have
every
right
to
be
upset
but
ii
wonder
if
you're
not
letting
yourself
get
a
shade
uh
more
personal
because
of
your
mother's
involvement
there
you
are
i
almost
didn't
find
you
in
this
crush
oh
uh
mrs
uh
uh
joyce
quite
a
turnout
you
have
here
right
not
since
um
not
since
not
for
a
while
rrumor
about
us
aaabout
what
indeed
how
strange
actually
i
think
they
may
have
my
research
keeps
bringing
me
back
to
european
wiccan
covens
i'm
pretty
sure
yes
there's
a
a
piece
of
information
i
need
that's
in
a
book
that
willow
borrowed
can
you
find
it
they're
confiscating
my
books
believe
me
i
tried
to
tell
that
to
the
nice
man
with
the
big
gun
i
don't
know
ordinarily
i
would
say
let's
widen
our
research
this
is
intolerable
snyder's
interfered
before
but
i
i
won't
take
this
from
that
twisted
little
homunculus
you
get
out
and
take
your
marauders
with
you
this
is
not
over
session
interrupted
who
said
you
could
interrupt
you
stupid
useless
fad
no
i
said
fad
and
i'll
say
it
again
what
i
just
assumed
someone
had
the
details
i
never
really
well
that
is
strange
yeah
well
somebody
else
do
it
this
thing's
locked
me
out
oh
'two
children
found
dead
mysterious
mark'
no
no
these
children
were
found
near
omaha
in
1949
fifty
years
ago
from
as
far
back
as
1649
can
i
see
that
written
by
a
cleric
from
a
village
near
the
black
forest
he
uh
wait
wait
a
minute
uh
uh
there
is
a
fringe
theory
held
by
a
few
folklorists
that
some
regional
stories
have
actual
um
very
literal
antecedents
of
course
well
it
makes
sense
now
some
demons
thrive
by
fostering
hatred
and
and
uh
persecution
amongst
the
mortal
animals
not
by
not
by
destroying
men
but
by
watching
men
destroy
each
other
now
they
feed
us
our
darkest
fear
and
turn
peaceful
communities
into
vigilantes
and
then
she
and
probably
dozens
of
others
are
persecuted
by
a
righteous
mob
it's
happened
all
throughout
history
it
happened
in
salem
not
surprisingly
stay
in
my
office
cordelia
pity
oh
why
are
you
here
wake
up
in
a
oh
never
mind
we
need
to
save
buffy
from
hansel
and
gretel
shred
the
wolfsbane
that's
the
uh
the
leafy
stuff
and
then
you
can
crush
the
satyrion
root
luften
sie
den
something
schlumer
schluter
it's
a
part
of
an
incantation
it's
in
german
and
without
my
book
it's
about
uh
lifting
a
veil
um
it
should
uh
make
the
demons
appear
in
their
true
form
which
with
any
luck
will
uh
negate
their
influence
and
uh
drop
a
toadstone
into
the
mixture
no
reason
it
should
it's
from
inside
the
toad
