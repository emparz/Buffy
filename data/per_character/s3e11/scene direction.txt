and
into
an
area
surrounded
by
bushes
she
hears
a
rustling
sound
coming
from
the
bush
directly
in

of
her
and
stops
instantly
her
gaze
fixed
on
the
shaking
branches
she
pulls
out
her
stake
and
gets

hears
a
voice
to
her
left
buffy
snaps
her
head
to
the

buffy
distracted
her
attention
is
back
on

rustling
bush
and

to

side
a
bit
suddenly
a
vampire
jumps
out
at
her
and
runs
straight
for
her
she
ducks
as
the
vampire
lunges
at
her
with
his
arms
outstretched
she
gets
back
up
and
delivers
a

hook
to
his

shoulders
and
rolls
onto

and
onto

a
stern
look
she
runs
off
after

joyce
lets
out
a
worried
sigh
and
decides
to
walk
the
short
distance
over
to
the
playground
there
she
sets
down
her
bag
and
the
thermos
on
a
bench
near

shivers
a
bit
from

cold
night
air

steps
over
to
the
concrete
border
between

and
the
sand
of

picks
it
up
and

and
the
energy
of

spell
begins
to
swirl
around

she
shivers
as
the
spell's
power
increases
around
her
building
ever
greater
strength
finally
since

hasn't
directed
the
spell
at
anyone

it
works
on

she
is
engulfed
by
a
sudden
burst
of
flame
people
in
the
crowd
scream
as
they
watch
an
instant
later
amy's
clothes
are
empty
and
they
and

ropes
drop
to
the
books
below
everyone
stares
in
amazement
buffy
and
willow
look
over
to
see
what
happened
to
her
then
a
rat
comes
crawling
out
of
amy's
clothes
it
scampers
down
the
pile
of
books
and
scurries
across
the
floor
the
frightened
adults
jump
out
of
its
way
buffy
can
only
watch
amy
go
willow
desperately
buffy
quietly
the
people
stare
at

and
horror

appear

crushing

picks

up
cordelia
sniffs
it
cordelia
quickly
drops
it
in
they
look

then
they
hear
willow
cry
out
oz
hops
up
on
a
bench
below
a
ventilation
shaft
grate
he
bangs
on
it
a
couple
of
times
and
it
gives
way
he
climbs
in
xander
is
right
behind
buffy
desperately
giles
ignores
her
protests
and
kneels
down
in
from
of
the
doors
he
carefully
inserts
the
pin
into
the
lock
and
begins
to
pick
it
cut
inside
the
flames
are
getting
very
close
to
willow
giles
gets
the
door
open
and
comes
in
buffy
sees
giles
giles
points
cordelia
to
a
fire
hose
in
the
corner
she
goes
to
it
and
smashes
the
glass
with
her
elbow
holding
up
her
hand
to
protect
her
face
from
the
glass
the
noise
gets
the
crowd's
attention
cordelia
pulls
out
the
hose
and
turns
it
on
spraying
the
advancing
crowd
giles
starts
reciting
his
incantation
in
very
bad
unintelligible
german
muffled
by
the
sound
of
the
water
spraying
cordelia
to
the
people
in
spite
of
all
the
spraying
not
very
much
water
has
gotten
on
the
flames
and
they
have
gotten
dangerously
close
to
willow
she
turns
the
stream
of
water
on
the
flames
and
quickly
douses
them
he
throws
the
bottle
to
the
floor
smashing
it
in
front
of
the
children
the
potion
begins
to
steam
around
them
hansel
and
gretel
look
at
each
other
and
embrace
a
moment
later
the
two
children
morph
into
a
single
demon
standing
over
seven
feet
215cm
tall
its
ears
are
pointed
and
huge
fangs
jut
from
its
lower
jaw
its
skin
is
red
and
mottled
and
its
hair
is
long
and
tangled
sheila
and
joyce
stare
up
at
the
demon
in
horror
the
other
people
in
the
room
all
run
out
screaming
the
demon
turns
to
face
buffy
out
of
her
trance
now
joyce
looks
at
the
two
girls
tied
up
and
helpless
against
him
the
demon
roars
and
comes
at
her
buffy
struggles
with
her
bonds
trying
to
get
free
the
ropes
don't
give
but
the
stake
breaks
it's
top
heavy
now
and
forces
buffy
to
bend
over
so
the
tip
is
pointing
at
the
demon
who
can't
stop
his
advance
and
impales
himself
through
the
neck
sheila
and
joyce
look
on
in
disgust
buffy
can't
straighten
herself
back
up
with
the
weight
of
the
demon's
body
at
the
other
end
of
the
stake
and
so
can't
see
the
result
of
her
unwitting
maneuver
suddenly
the
ceiling
gives
way
above
them
and
oz
and
xander
come
crashing
down
the
books
break
their
fall
they
look
up
weakly
at
buffy
and
the
dead
demon
willow
ruefully
she
takes
a
pinch
of
the
herbs
she's
crushed
and
sprinkles
it
onto
a
ceremonial
iron
plate
set
out
between
the
girls
buffy
looks
down
at
their
preparations
and
sighs
she
lights
a
match
and
sets
it
to
the
mixture
of
herbs
and
roots
on
the
plate
while
willow
recites
her
spell
it
begins
to
burn
emitting
purple
smoke
willow
and
buffy
both
look
over
at
amy
the
rat
she
gets
up
on
her
hind
legs
expectantly
nothing
happens
though
and
she
gets
back
down
on
all
fours
seemingly
disappointed
buffy
looks
over
at
willow
