there
were
no
marks
wait
ii
mean
there
there
was
a
mark
um
aa
symbol
iit
was
on
their
hands
the
cops
are
keeping
it
quiet
but
i
got
a
good
look
at
it
there
find

thing
that
uses
this
symbol
and
point
me
at
it
hmm
what
giles
speak
a
group
of
human
beings
someone
with
a
soul
did
this
okay
then
while
you're
looking
for
the
meaning
of
that
symbol
thingy
could
you
also
find
a
loophole
in
that
'slayers
don't
kill
people'
rule
oh
it's
completely
personal
giles
find
me
the
people
that
did
this
please
you
guys
didn't
hear
a
murder
somebody
killed
two
little
kids
they
were
like
seven
or
eight
years
old
my
mom
found
the
bodies
during
patrol
last
night
more
bad
she
picked
last
night
of
all
nights
for
a
surprise
bonding
visit
no
the
point
is
she's
completely
wigging
um
everyone
you
know
'cause
of
what
happened
yeah
he
uh
he
thinks
it
might
be
something
ritual
a
cult
uh
he's
still
looking
in
the
meantime
we're
gonna
add
to
my
patrol
and
and
y'know
keep
an
eye
out
you
know
what
uh
would
you
guys
excuse
us
for
a
little
bit
mom
i
really
think
maybe
this
isn't
the
best
place
to
talk
about
this
no
it's
just
this
hall
is
about
school
and
you're
about
home
mix
them
my
world
dissolves
well
giles
can
always
use
help
in
the
library
you
called
everybody
that
you
know
uhhuh
that's
great
uh
but
you
know
what
a
lot
of
times
when
we're
working
on
stuff
like
this
we
like
to
keep
the
number
of
people
that
know
about
it
kind
of
small
this
is
great
maybe
we
could
all
go
patrolling
together
later
hi
you
guys
okay
i
doubt
they'll
have
any
more
trouble
corde
yeah
i
got
that
one
besides
witches
didn't
do
it
you
found
the
meaning
of
the
symbol
hey
is
willow
around
those
her
books
you
are
guilty
you
got
illicit
smoochies
gonna
have
to
pay
the
price
'cause
he's
usually
such
a
chatterbox
what
is
this
this
is
a
witch
symbol
willow
that
symbol
was
on
the
murdered
children
what
are
they
looking
for
giles
giles
we
need
those
books
no
there's
something
about
the
symbol
that
we're
missing
using
what
aa
dictionary
and
'my
friend
flicka'
answer
to
moo
did
that
sentence
just
make
some
sense
that
i'm
not
in
on
and
who
came
up
with
that
lame
name
you're
the
one
who
ordered
the
raid

you
run
out
of
okay
maybe
i
don't
have
a
plan
lord

i
don't
have
lapel
buttons
and
maybe
next
time
that
the
world
is
getting
sucked
into
hell
i
won't
be
able
to
stop
it
because
the
antihellsucking
book
