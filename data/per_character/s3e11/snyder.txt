this
is
a
glorious
day
for
principals
everywhere
no
pathetic
whining
about
students'
rights
just
a
long
row
of
lockers
and
a
man
with
a
key
ms
rosenberg
my
office
i
love
the
smell
of
desperate
librarian
in
the
morning
oh
my
so
fierce
i
suppose
i
should
hear
you
out
just
how
is
um
'blood
rites
and
sacrifices'
appropriate
material
for
a
public
school
library
chess
club
branching
out
oh
i
should
say
it's
just
beginning
fight
it
if
you
want
'mothers
opposed
to
the
occult'
a
powerful
new
group
that
would
be
the
founder
i
believe
you
call
her
'mom'
