busy
little
slayer

doubt
your
doubt

knows
that
witches
killed
those
kids
and
amy
is
a
witch
and
michael
is
whatever
the
boy
of
witch
is
plus
being
the
poster
child
for
yuck
if
you're
gonna
hang
with
them

badness
'cause
that's
what
you
get
when
you
hang
with
freaks
and
losers
believe
me
i
know
that
was
a
pointed
comment
about
me
hanging
with
you
guys
hey
get
your
grubby
custodial
hands
off
that
that
hair
spray
costs
45
and
it's
imported
wake
up
took
you
long
enough
to
wake
up
my
hand
hurts
things
are
way
out
of
control
giles
first
the
thing
at
school
and
then
my
mom
confiscates
all
of
my
black
clothes
and
scented
candles
i
came
over
here
to
tell
buffy
to
stop
this
craziness
and
found
you
all
unconscious
again
how
many
times
have
you
been
knocked
out
anyway
i
swear
one
of
these
times
you're
gonna
wake
up
in
a
coma
now
let's
be
clear
the
brain
damage
happened
before
i
hit
you
i
can't
believe
you
had
this
stuff
in
your
apartment
it
smells
foul
what
are
you
muttering
about
what
does
it
mean
this
it
doesn't
look
like
a
toad
i
hate
you
ouch
you
got
hair
with
that
god
you
really
were
the
little
youthful
offender
weren't
you
you
must
just
look
back
on
that
and
cringe
you
like
that
huh
how
'bout
some
more
oh
right
okay
i
think
i
liked
the
two
little
ones
more
than
the
one
big
one
