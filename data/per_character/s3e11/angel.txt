people
are
talking

even
talking

another
word
for
dam
buffy
you
know
i'm
still
figuring
things
out
there's
a
lot
i
don't
understand
but
i
do
know
it's
important
to
keep
fighting
i
learned
that
from
you
we
never
win
we
never
will
that's
not
why
we
fight
we
do
it
'cause
there's
things
worth
fighting
for
those
kids
their
parents
look
i
know
it's
not
much
