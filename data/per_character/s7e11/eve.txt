great
so
the
slayer
who's
supposed
to
protect
us
let
her
get
killed
and
why
isn't
she
back
yet
buffy
she
left
to
get
the
new
girl
over
an
hour
ago
mabye
she
ran
into
trouble
you
don't
think
she
was
too
late
again
spike
sorry
i'm
confused
he's
that
vampire
who's
been
killing
people
right
he's
the
one
you're
worried
about
helping
it's
just
well
we've
been
talking
and
do
we
have
some
kind
of
plan
you
know
any
kind
of
plan
to
keep
us
from
dying
what—what
are
we
all
doing
here
i
meant
why
are
we
all
bothering
it's
not
like
we
can
make
a
difference
she's
right
and
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
it
i
mean
i've
never
seen
a
real
vampire
in
my
whole
life
much
less
slayed
one
that's
what
i'm
saying
not
one
of
us
is
remotely
prepared
to
be
activated
as
a
new
chosen
one
well
when
the
slayer
dies
i
mean
nobody
lives
forever
right
get's
activated
uhhuh
like
any
of
this
does
no
matter
how
many
there
are
one
of
us
is
gonna
be
the
next
slayer
with
the
weight
of
the
world
on
her
shoulders
never
too
late
it
could
be
anyone
especially
since
there's
so
few
of
us
left
they'll
just
run
through
each
one
of
us
one
after
the
other
kinda
creepy
huh
all
we
do
is
wait
around
for
each
other
to
die
just
my
personal
opinion
but
i
don't
think
the
slayer
can
protect
us
from
the
first
what's
the
problem
officer
oops
one
more
down
oh
well
can't
save
'em
all
can
ya
buffy
thanks
for
the
slumber
party
girls
it's
been
real
fun
the
last
couple
of
nights
i
learned
a
whole
lot—
or
you'll
do
what
i'll
be
sending
a
guest
over
to
visit
y'all
later
on
tonight
after
the
sun
goes
down
of
course
try
and
make
him
feel
welcome
before
he
rips
y'all
to
pieces
bye
