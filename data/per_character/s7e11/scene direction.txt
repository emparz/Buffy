it
punches
buffy
to
the

she
gets
back
up
to
fight
more
it
throws
her
about
20
feet
away
and
she
lands
on
the
scaffolds
knocking
the
crossbow
out
of
kennedy's
hands
buffy
picks
up
the
weapon
and
aims
it
at
the
turokhan
and
fires
as
it
runs
toward
her
hitting
it
right
in
the
heart
it
only
pauses
for
a
moment
then
comes
at
her
again
buffy
grabs
a
nearby
pipe
from
the
scaffolding
and
uses
it
as
a
staff
she
then
uses
it
to
propel
herself
away
from
the
fight
but
the
turokhan
is
right
behind
her
she
grabs
a
pickaxe
and
swings
it
at
the
turokhan
but
it
ducks
and
pushes
her
into
the
wall
of
the
construction
office
trailer
buffy
falls
to
the
ground
and
the
turokhan
disarms
her
before
throwing
her
back
toward
the
center
of
the
open
area
it
punches
her
again
and
again
she
falls
into
a
pile
of
cinder
blocks
but
picks
one
up
to
throw
at
the
turokhan—but
it
crushes
it
before
she
can
throw
it
it
punches
her
again
and
kicks
her
under
some
scaffolding
before
throwing
her
a
dozen
feet
into
the
air
through
the
scaffold
platform
buffy
manages
to
stay
on
the
platform
and
the
turokhan
scales
the
scaffolding
to
get
to
her
he
grabs
her
by
the
throat
lifting
her
off
the
ground
and
choking
her
as
she
struggles
against
him
buffy
reaches
down
grabs
the
arrow
in
the
turokhan's
chest
pulls
it
out
and
jabs
its
eye
it
roars
and
drops
buffy
while
it's
dealing
with
its
injury
buffy
starts
punching
it
and
kicks
it
to
the
ground
where
it
lands
in
a
pile
of
cinder
blocks
and
boards
weakly
it
tries
to
punch
her
back
but
she
keeps
punching
and
kicking
it
until
finally
she
can
bang
its
head
into
the
metal
scaffolding
buffy
grabs
some
nearby
barbed
wire
and
slips
it
around
the
turokhan's
throat
it
falls
to
the
ground
and
buffy
pulls
on
it
hard
enough
to
sever
its
