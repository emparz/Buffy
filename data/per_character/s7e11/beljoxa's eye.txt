here
it
cannot
be
fought
it
cannot
be
killed
the
first
evil
has
been
and
always
will
be
since
before
the
universe
was
born
long
after
there
is
nothing
else
it
will
go
on
what
am
i
talking
to
myself
here
there's
no
way
the
eye
sees
not
the
future
only
the
truth
of
the
now
and
before
the
opportunity
has
only
recently
presented
itself
the
mystical
forces
surrounding
the
chosen
line
have
become
irrevocably
altered
become
unstable
vulnerable
the
first
evil
did
not
cause
the
disruption
only
seized
upon
it
to
extinguish
the
lives
of
the
chosen
forever
the
slayer
