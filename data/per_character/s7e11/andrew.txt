i'm
with
him
keep
the
chatter
down
or
speak
up
so
i
can
hear
you
i'm
bored
episode
i
bored
hey
rona
so
giles
with
that
thing
guarding
the
entrance
to
the
first's
crib
how
will
buffy
get
to
spike
ow
watch
it
that's
my
joystick
hand
six
times
but
the
book
was
scarier
than
the
movie
'cause
instead
of
crushing
his
foot
with
a
sledge
hammer
kathy
bates
chops
it
off
with—
i'll
be
good
all
right
retrieving
a
potential
let's
do
it
or
i
could
just
go
wash
up
ok
here's
another
interesting
thing
how
come
the
slayer's
always
a
girl
i
think
a
guy
slayer
would
be
badass
like—like
if
there
was
this
ninja
a
guy
slayer
would
be
like
you
may
be
silent
but
this'll
shut
you
up
hiya
the
silent
warrior
ha
ha—i
think
not
she
can't
even
slay
that
special
vampire
everyone's
saying
and
also
why's
she
so
about
saving
spike
he's
a
worse
killer
than
me
by
a
way
lot
what
about
me
did
it
ever
occur
to
anyone
that
i
could
be
a
lot
more
useful
around
here
i
used
to
be
an
evil
genius
hello
well
um
raising
demons
mostly
ok
so
not
for
now
but
also
there
was
planning
there
were
um
blueprints
i
can
be
in
this
kicking
it
righteous
yeah
oh
oh
yeah
not
even
license
to
kill
huh
pretty
cool
you
know
timothy
dalton
never
got
his
props
'cause
he
came
in
at
the
end
of
an
old
regime
but
he
had
it
goin'
on
he
went
rogue
with
the
broccolis
they
were
just
treading
water
stylistically
i'm
so
alone
i
hate
that
you
don't
even
know
the
slayer's
not
getting
it
done
i
have
got
my
ear
to
the
ground
and
that's
the
word
do
you
wanna
play
kevin
bacon
i
need
to
go
wash
up
again
she's
right
where
would
the
justice
league
have
been
if
they
hadn't
put
their
differences
aside
to
stop
the
imperium
and
his
shapeshifting
alien
horde
can
i
have
something
come
on
the
turokhan's
coming
for
me
too
you
know
i
have
a
right
to
defend
myself—
if
you
say
so
um
deflector
shields—deflector
shields
up
hhey
i
need
that
i'm
moving
climbing's
not
my
thing
i
got
a
inner
ear
condition
way
to
keep
up
morale
in
a
crisis
no
wonder
buffy's
the
leader
um
what's
my
position
two
men
enter
one
man
leaves
