no
lie
she
still
looked
like
a
big
bruise
when
i
got
here
and
that
was
already
like
the
day
after
i've
seen
one
well
my
watcher
once
showed
me
a
photograph
of
one
a
blurry
photograph
i
heard
there's
more
than
one
slayer
there's
another
oneâ€”somewhere
we
should
run
it
could
still
be
here
it
could
be
any
one
of
us
and
with
what
maybe
it
can't
be
killed
for
the
moment
it's
the
middle
of
nothing
maybe
it
can't
be
killed
