little
uncomfortable

me

how
many
girls

should
enjoy
having
this
bed

to
myself
as
long
as
i
can
totally
and
with
this
many
girls
well

just
saying
if
we
don't

another
bathroom
in
this
house
soon
things
are
gonna
get
ugly
somebody
not
me
i
only
got
a
halfsister

we
didn't
have
to
share
her
bedroom
was
in
another
wing
of
the
house
yeah
just
a
couple
a
few
our
summer
home
in
the
hamptons

a
trick

a
rabbit

of
something
or
make
something

hey
if
i
wanted
to
sleep
i'd
be
downstairs
catching
z's
with
the
other
girls
it's
called
training
didn't
your
watcher
ever
teach
you
the
word
we
have
to
be
ready
if
something
comes
down—
i
feel
pretty
prepared
more
than
one
what
doesn't
work
that
way
in
fact
the
younger
the
better
in
fact
i'm
starting
to
think
it
might
be
too
late
for
me
who
get
away
from
who
and
go
where
vi
you
heard
her
with
whatever
it
takes
right
hey

a
good
word

said
trying
is
good
it's
this
end
right
here
just
stick
that
in
the
bad
guys
any
more
questions
this'll
do
me
since
i
was
eight
wow

really
can
float
stuff

heard
this
voodoo
once
turned
you
into
the
big
scary
big
scary
willow—that's
something
i'd
almost
like
to
see—
i
said
almost
how's
evil
taste
it's
hurting
her
i'll
stay
or
it
could
just
skip
that
part
and
come
straight
here
