past
the
singer
and
into
the
crowd
cordelia
and
xander
are
dancing
close
with
their
arms
around
each
other
and
smiling
the
language
is
an
annoying
necessity

and
i
depend
on
all
the
regular
things
the
camera
reaches
willow
who
is
looking
around
for
buffy
she
turns
around
looks
up
and
spots
her
on
the
upper
level
leaning
against
the
railing
and
watching
the
band
the
camera
pans
up
to
her
got
a
list
tattooed
on
my
memory

of
how
our
tryst
should
unfold
behind
buffy
a
boy
approaches
her
i'm
falling
from
the
opposite

a
moment

sadly
down
at
the
band

for
the
stairs
i'm
falling
from
the
opposite

what
good

my
heart's
enlarged
and
i

when
buffy
reaches
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
willow
meets
her
my
love
must
be
a
kind
of
blind
love
she
walks
toward
the
sound
and
through
a
pair
of
doors
i
can't
see
anyone
but
you
beyond
them
is
another
set
of
doors
to
the
music
room
a
class
of
'55
sadie
hawkins
dance
flyer
is
taped
to
one
of
the
door
windows
she
steps
over
to
the
other
door
and
looks
in
there
she
sees
james
and
grace
dancing
slowly
to
the
music
the
moon
may
be
high

but
i
can't
see
a
thing
in
the
sky
when
james
turns
into
view
again
buffy
sees
that
his
face
is
all
rotted
'cause
i
only
have
eyes
for
you
buffy
stares
back
in
openmouthed
shock
james
and
grace
are
suddenly
gone
my
love
must
be
a
kind
of
blind
love
she
looks
over
into
a
mirror
and
james
looks
back
at
her
her
eyes
are
full
of
tears
as
she
looks
at
him
he
looks
down
at
the
gun
in
his
hand
i
can't
see
anyone
but
you
the
camera
pans
down
from
buffy's
face
to
the
gun
in
her
hand
she
raises
it
slowly
but
a
hand
takes
it
and
pushes
it
back
down
she
turns
and
finds
herself
face
to
face
with
angelus
