like
this
big
arm
that
came
out
of
the
locker
but
then
we
opened
it
again
it
was
gone
nothing

a
normal
teenager

dr
laura

the
deceased
what
i
don't
know
these
fights

it's
sort
of
specific
he

a
little
more
fallout
from
my
love
life

need
some
alternate
ghost
theories
what
do
we
know
besides
that
which

tonight
1955
okay
here's
the
new
strangeness
i
dreamt
about
this
woman
grace
newman
the
other
day
her
and
this
guy
he
couldn't
make
her
love
him
so
he
killed
her
sicko
smart
sure
i
feel
lousy
for
her
he's
a
murderer
and
he
should
pay
for
it
no
he
should
be
doing
sixty
years
in
a
prison
breaking
rocks
and
making
special
friends
with
roscoe
the
weightlifter
well
considering
how
violent
it
is
i'm
gonna
say
his
who
cares
what
he
wants
we
need
to
shut
him
down
before
some
other
innocent
guy
goes
and
kills
some
poor
nice
girl
and
then
blows
his
brains
out
all
over
the
music
room
wall
what's
the
deal
well
i'll
take
the
hot
spot
if
there's
trouble
that's
where
it'll
be
well
i'm
hoping
he'll
show
i
truly
am
okay
we
all
have
our
places
we
do
the
chant
and
light
the
candle
at
midnight
exactly
any
questions
okay
let's
do
this
out
of
house
and
home
never
to
come
here
again
get
back
he
wants
forgiveness
good
he
doesn't
deserve
it
no
james
destroyed
the
one
person
he
loved
the
most
in
a
moment
of
blind
passion
and
that's
not
something
you
forgive
no
matter
why
he
did
what
he
did
and
no
matter
if
he
knows
now
that
it
was
wrong
and
selfish
and
stupid
it
is
just
something
he's
gonna
have
to
live
with
you're
the
only
one
the
only
person
i
can
talk
to
you
can't
make
me
disappear
just
because
you
say
it's
over
i
don't
give
a
damn
about
a
normal
life
i'm
going
crazy
not
seeing
you
i
think
about
you
every
minute
come
back
here
we're
not
finished
you
don't
care
anymore
is
that
it
then
tell
me
you
don't
love
me
no
a
person
doesn't
just
wake
up
and
stop
loving
somebody
love
is
forever
i'm
not
afraid
to
use
it
i
swear
if
i
can't
be
with
you
bitch
stop
it
stop
it
don't
make
me
don't
talk
to
me
like
i'm
some
stupid
grace
butbut
i
killed
you
oh
it
is
my
fault
how
could
i
angel
james
picked
me
i
guess
i
guess
i
was
the
one
he
could
relate
to
he
was
so
sad
i
still
a
part
of
me
just
doesn't
understand
why
she
would
forgive
him

guess
not
