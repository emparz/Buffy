hey
you're
bailing
you've
been
doing
that
a
lot
patrolling
and
sacking
in
fact
you've
kind
of
been
allworkandnoplay
buffy
you
came
you
saw
you
rejected
well
maybe
you
need
to
date
to
get
in
date
mode
you're
thinking
too
much
maybe
you
need
to
be
impulsive
okay
the
angel
thing
went
badly
i'm
on
board
with
that
but
that's
not
your
fault
and
anyways
love
isn't
always
like
that
love
can
be
nice
so
for
next
time
read
the
chapters
on
information
grouping
and
binary
coding
i
bet
you'll
think
coding
is
pretty
cool
i
mean
if
you
find
twodigit
multistacked
conversions
and
primary
number
clusters
a
big
hoot
giles
i
made
them
laugh
did
you
hear
i
did
the
joke
thing
well
i
had
good
lesson
plans
ms
calendar
had
them
on
her
computer
and
i
found
a
bunch
of
files
and
internet
sites
on
paganism
and
magic
and
stuff
yes
it's
really
interesting
and
uh
i
found
this
in
her
drawer
she
told
me
it
was
a
rose
quartz
and
it
has
healing
powers
i
thought
she'd
want
you
to
have
it
xander
what
happened
did
cordelia
win
another
round
in
the
broom
closet
a
ghost
cool
well
why
is
it
here
does
it
just
wanna
scare
people
well
what
can
we
do
is
there
any
way
to
stop
it
what
about
the
gun
did
you
find
it
but
what
about
the
gun
i
mean
angel
didn't
shoot
ms
she's
right
it's
a
pattern
that
doesn't
fit
with
the
way
ms
this
is
freaky
i
don't
ever
remember
ever
seeing
giles
be
this
weird
okay
but
this
ghost
stuff
is
something
else
let
me
do
a
crosscheck
on
other
shootings
at
the
school
oh
boy
we
know
plenty
it
says
a
student
murdered
a
teacher
on
the
night
of
the
sadie
hawkins
dance
the
rumor
was
they
were
having
an
affair
and
she
tried
to
break
it
off
after
he
killed
her
he
went
into
the
music
room
and
shot
himself
it
all
fits
the
gun
the
sadie
hawkins
dance
how
did
you
know
jim
stanley
he's
the
one
he
did
it
he
looks
so
normal
on
this
picture
he
was
smart
too
he
made
the
honor
roll
i
know
but
well
don't
you
feel
kind
of
bad
for
them
with
his
life
whose
ghost
do
you
think
we're
dealing
with
his
or
hers
well
i've
been
browsing
on
some
of
ms
calendar's
pagan
sites
maybe
i
can
find
a
way
to
communicate
with
them
and
we
can
find
out
what
he
wants
remember
the
plan
to
contact
the
spirit
and
talk
to
it
scrap
that
plan
buffy
you
were
right
the
time
for
touchyfeely
communication
is
passed
i've
done
some
homework
and
found
the
only
solution
is
the
final
solution
not
quite
exorcism
okay
see
here
the
balcony
that's
where
the
original
teacher
died
back
in
1955
and
that
teacher
last
night
that's
the
hot
spot
where
all
the
bad
mojo
is
coming
from
we
need
to
create
a
mangustripod
one
person
chants
here
on
the
hot
spot
and
the
other
three
chant
in
other
places
around
the
school
forming
a
triangle
it's
supposed
to
bind
the
bad
spirit
and
keep
it
from
doing
any
more
harm
