yes
yes
so
it
seems
ii
mean
um
uh
you
did
indeed
good
good
good
show
iii
just
stopped
by
to
to
see
if
you
needed
any
assistance
but
you
seem
to
have
things
quite
under
control
yes
yes
she
was
very
um
uh
dedicated
oh
oh
thank
you
willow
that's
um
that's
very
thoughtful
of
you
loch
ness
monster
ooh
sounds
like
paranormal
phenomena
yes
unfortunately
he
doesn't
know
exactly
what
he
wants
that's
that's
the
trouble
see
uh
many
times
the
spirit
is
plagued
by
all
manner
of
worldly
troubles
being
dead
it
has
no
way
to
uh
to
make
its
peace
so
it
it
lashes
out
growing
ever
more
confused
ever
more
angry
uh
the
only
tried
and
true
way
is
to
work
out
what
unresolved
issues
keep
it
here
andandand
um
resolve
them
only
if
we
can
find
out
who
this
spirit
is
or
was
jenny
what's
going
on
you
just
shot
a
woman
it
was
just
as
with
the
the
couple
you
encountered
the
other
night
buffy
the
the
janitor
remembered
everything
he
he
knew
he'd
killed
this
poor
woman
but
he
had
no
idea
why
well
theythey
had
no
intimate
relationship
no
no
the
police
everybody
wewewewe
searched
high
and
low
i
think
it's
very
clear
what's
happening
here
it's
jenny
well
don't
you
see
well
shesheshe
died
here
under
tragic
circumstances
aaand
now
she's
trapped
the
gun
is
insignificant
it's
the
violence
of
the
thing
that
matters
yes
well
i
uh
i
appreciate
your
thoughts
on
the
matter
i
in
fact
i
well
i
encourage
you
to
to
always
uh
challenge
me
uh
when
you
feel
it's
appropriate
you
should
never
be
cowed
by
authority
except
of
course
in
this
instance
when
i
am
clearly
right
and
you
are
clearly
wrong
god
willow
what
are
you
doing
here
you're
not
supposed
to
be
inside
i'm
uh
i'm
i'm
trying
to
uh
i
think
ii
may
be
close
to
uh
contacting
jenny
what's
that
smell
ah
right
of
course
did
you
use
sulfur
that's
clever
uh
well
uh
run
along
then
ththere
may
be
some
uh
paranormal
phphenomena
if
i
contact
her
yyyou
don't
want
to
be
in
the
line
of
fire
willow
where
are
you
are
you
all
right
i
know
it's
it's
not
her
is
it
careful
up
here
oh
my
god
you
all
right
the
good
news
is
none
of
you
girls
were
shot
well
we've
established
based
on
all
the
parallels
andandand
buffy's
visions
that
it's
james'
spirit
well
he's
obviously
reliving
the
night
of
the
sadie
hawkins
dance
when
he
killed
ms
newman
itit'sit's
common
enough
for
a
spirit
to
do
this
to
recreate
a
a
tragedy
he's
he's
trying
to
resolve
whatever
issues
are
keeping
him
in
limbo
wwwhat
exactly
those
are
i'm
not
yes
i
imagine
he
does
but
when
james
possesses
people
they
act
out
exactly
what
happened
that
night
so
he's
experiencing
a
form
of
purgatory
instead
i
mean
he's
he's
doomed
to
to
kill
his
ms
newman
over
and
over
and
over
again
and
forgiveness
is
impossible
to
forgive
is
an
act
of
compassion
buffy
it's
it's
not
done
because
people
deserve
it
it's
done
because
they
need
it
well
not
now
no
the
uh
the
spirit
is
too
angry
too
too
powerful
no
we
have
to
work
out
exactly
how
and
and
if
this
thing
can
be
defeated
no
i
believe
she's
under
the
spirit's
thrall
he's
he's
calling
her
james
needs
her
to
reenact
everything
that
happened
on
the
night
that
he
he
killed
ms
newman
he
wants
to
change
things
make
make
a
happy
ending
yes
but
the
school's
deserted
there's
no
way
for
james
to
are
you
feeling
any
better
well
they
can
both
rest
now
does
it
matter
