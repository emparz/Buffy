you
can't
protect
her
you
couldn't
protect
me
i
tried
to
scream
doesn't
matter
how
much
you
scream
nobody
ever
hears
you
busy
making
out
with
your
dead
boyfriend
while
i
was
ripped
to
death
by
a
werewolf
is
that
why
you
let
me
die
this
place
is
ours
now
it
was
built
on
our
graves
think
they're
gonna
come
back
we
never
left
we'll
always
be
here
just
like
you
why
do
you
think
we
picked
you
the
ones
no
one
will
miss
the
ones
that
don't
belong
you
spend
all
your
time
trying
to
get
out
of
high
school
and
now
you'll
never
ever
leave
