it
is
my
great
pleasure
and
privilege
to
announce
the
official
opening—on
the
very
ground
that
it
first
stood
upon—of
the
brand
new
state
of
the
art
sunnydale
high
tough
to
let
'em
go
huh
i'm
robin
wood
new
principal
nice
to
meet
you
huh
you
seem
a
bit
young
to
have
such
a
gownup
daughter
oh
right
um
of
course
i
actually
have
heard
of
you
miss
summers
graduated
from
the
old
high
school
am
i
right
well
i
better
get
back
to
work
gotta
start
deadening
young
minds
it's
really
nice
to
meet
you
you
have
fun
whoa
miss
summers
i
didn't
know
you
were
still
about
i
thought
in
general
it
was
customary
for
a
person
who's
graduated
to
um
you
know
go
somewhere
else
you
know
i
um
have
to
be
honest
i
actually
know
a
little
bit
more
about
you
than
i
let
on
before
oh
it
really
is
the
school
board
recommended
i
spend
a
little
time
reading
your
record
it's
um
quite
a
pageturner
kind
of
a
checkered
past
well
it's
clear
your
sister
looks
up
to
you
which
i
think
is
great
well
how
'bout
we
give
her
a
chance
first
just
as
long
as
she
keeps
her
grades
up
and—
that's
a
part
of
the
reason
we
don't
allow
cell
phones
in—
oh
my
god
your
dogs
are
dead
yeah
no
of
course
and
good
luck
with
thatdog
tragedy
curiouser
and
curiouser
carlos
trejo
and
kit
holburn
right
possibly
the
only
two
students
in
this
school
whose
files
are
as
thick
as
yours
was
i
was
looking
for
one
or
both
of
them
to
actually
implode
in
a
fearsome
way
right
before
midterms
and
now
i
see
that
you
got
'em
socializing
and
hugging
and
actually
if
i'm
not
mistaken
headed
to
class
look
i
know
you're
probably
more
than
happy
to
get
out
of
this
place
but
i
gotta
tell
you
miss
summers
i
think
you
belong
here
listen
i
know
this
school's
reputation
what
you
think
i
got
this
job
based
on
seniority
we
got
a
lot
of
troubled
students
here
and
just
enough
money
to
keep
this
place
from
caving
in
well
we
do
have
a
community
outreach
program
and
the
money
we
could
pay
you
wouldn't
even
fold
but
it
would
just
be
a
couple
of
days
a
week
well
we
have
a
guidance
counselor
but
i
was
thinking
the
kids
could
use
someone
you
know
closer
to
their
age
who
still—
what
you
serious
you—you
did
hear
the
part
about
the
money
right
well
that's
great
look
at
that
it's
not
even
noon
and
i've
already
bullied
my
first
family
member
into
helping
out
i'm
going
to
be
the
best
principal
ever
