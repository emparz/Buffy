you
mind
could
you
take
her
to
the
incinerator
i
have
some
business
to
wait

moment

but
it's
imperative
that
i
see
her
here
well
when
will
you
yeah
well
you
are
her
watcher
i'd
expect
her
to
at
least
check
in
to
yes
i'm
aware
that
there's
a
great
deal
of
demonic
activity
in
cleveland
here
it
is
i've
found
it
look
it's
what
um
cordelia
was
wearing
it's
the
the
uh
symbol
of
of
anyanka
well
no
um
anyanka
is
a
sort
of
a
patron
saint
of
scorned
women
uh
shshe
grants
wishes
she
said
something
about
everything
being
different
that
the
she
said
the
uh
the
slayer
was
supposed
to
be
here
was
um
meant
to
have
been
here
already
yes
i
tried
calling
her
but
um
look
i'm
i'm
i'm
gonna
have
to
research
this
anyanka
thing
further
um
i
have
some
more
volumes
at
at
home
you
two
two
get
some
sleep
run
buffy
summers
ah
ah
ah
yes
here
'in
order
to
defeat
anyanka
one
must
destroy
her
powercenter
this
should
reverse
all
the
wishes
she's
granted
rendering
her
mortal
and
powerless
again'
you
see
without
her
powercenter
she'd
jjust
be
aaan
ordinary
woman
again
and
all
this
would
be
um
well
different
well
i'd
say
that
my
my
watcher
muscles
haven't
completely
atrophied
after
all
um
well
um
um
it
doesn't
say
she's
not
a
vampire
i
don't
want
to
kill
her
miss
summers
i
want
to
reverse
whatever
effect
she's
had
on
this
this
world
giles
yeah
well
i'm
sure
it's
not
that
simple
but
i
have
to
believe
in
a
better
world
cordelia
said
she
knew
that
i
was
meant
to
be
your
watcher
she
said
she
knew
you
the
master
sent
his
most
vicious
disciples
to
kill
her
now
she
she
must
have
posed
some
threat
to
him
um
supreme
vampire
around
these
parts
he
he
lives
on
the
outskirts
of
town
in
an
old
club
people
have
tried
you
can't
just
walk
in
there
and
at
least
let's
muster
some
kind
of
force
oh
anyanka
ii
beseech
thee
um
in
the
name
of
all
women
scorned
come
before
me
oh
cordelia
chase
what
did
she
wish
for
you're
gonna
change
it
back
i'm
not
afraid
of
you
your
only
power
lies
in
the
wishing
because
it
has
to
be
