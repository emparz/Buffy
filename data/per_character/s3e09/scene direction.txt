buffy
yells
out
desperately
near
a
picnic
table
xander
is
just
coming
to
apparently
having
been
knocked
around
by
the
monster
as
well
at
the
table
willow
frantically
searches
through
their
bag
of
demonkilling
implements
buffy
struggles
with
the
monster's
hand
at
her
neck
but
can't
get
it
to
budge
and
has
a
hard
time
breathing
willow
still
searching
she
finds
a
knife
and
runs
with
it
to
buffy's
aid
she
tosses
the
knife
to
buffy
who
blindly
grabs
it
from
behind
out
of
midair
and
stabs
the
monster
in
the
chest
the
monster
immediately
falls
over
dead
taking
buffy
down
with
it
willow
and
xander
help
her
up
buffy
takes
a
deep
breath
willow
looks
down
at
the
monster
they
walk
over
to
the
picnic
table
buffy
sits
crosslegged
on
one
end
of
the
table

sits
on
the
other
and

sits
on
the
bench
below
and
between
them
and
grabs
a
drink
xander
munches
on
a
snack
buffy
reaches
for
a
snack
buffy
munches
the
snack
xander
to
willow
the
last
part
of
the
picture
left
in
her
hand
is
of
xander
and
she
cuts
diagonally
right
through
his
face
bye
cordelia's
eyes
and
cheeks
are
heavy
with
tears
she
sighs
takes
a
match
and
strikes
it
she
lights
xander's
part
of
the
picture
she
drops
the
lit
piece
into
the
bowl
and
holds
the
match
to
the
others
they
suddenly
all
burst
into
flame
the
light
of
the
flame
shows
just
how
tired
slagged
and
haggard
cordelia
has
become
she
watches
as
the
flames
consume
the
image
of
xander
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
the
halls
at
sunnydale
high
school
willow
waits
around
the
corner
from
oz's
locker
peeking
around
every
few
seconds
to
see
if
he's
arrived
looking
very
worried

comes
up
behind

at

a
nontouching
hug
and
kisses
on
both
cheeks
harmony
pulls
her
to
the
front
anya
to
cordelia
cordelia
raises
her
eyebrows
they
all
exchange
a
little
fake
nervous
laughter
she
leads
her
over
to
the
outside
stairs
where
jonathon
is
sitting
nursing
a
soft
drink
he
is
taken
aback
by
the
sudden
attention
and
looks
around
to
see
if
they
didn't
really
mean
someone
else
but
there
is
no
one
else
cordelia
realizes
she's
been
had
harmony
giggles
she
laughs
and
she
and
her
group
walk
off

gives
her
a
sympathetic
look
knowing
what
it's
like
and
goes
back
to
nursing
his
soda

stops
opening
his
locker
and
slowly
turns
to
face
her
oz
starts
to
leave
willow
stops
him
he
stops
and
reluctantly
gives
her
his
attention
willow
is
left
feeling
completely
helpless
oz
goes
on
his
way
leaving
her
standing
there
when
he
spots
her
he
stops
cordelia
looks
for
a
way
to
turn
this
to
her
advantage
and
pulls
an
old
boyfriend
out
of
the
crowd
she
smiles
to
expose
her
teeth
and
angles
her
head
up
so
he
can
see
she
shifts
her
head
back
and
forth
and
john
lee
dutifully
follows
her
movements
from
a
distance
it
looks
to
xander
like
they
are
kissing
when
he's
seen
enough
he
goes
back
into
the
cafeteria
when
cordelia
sees
that
he's
gone
she
steps
back
from
john
lee
john
lee
smiles
john
lee
makes
suggestive
eyes
cordelia
surprised
to
find
the
tables
turned
john
lee
leaves
cordelia
can't
believe
what
a
social
leper
she's
suddenly
become
she
starts
back
down
the
hall
and
is
startled
when
anya
bumps
into
her
anya
smiles
cordelia
notices
anya's
pendant
they
start
down
the
hall
deserves
whatever
he
gets
is
it
too
much
to
ask
for
a
little
backup
buffy
puts
her
hand
on
his
knee
buffy
takes
her
hand
back
at
the
bar
cordelia
is
still
enjoying
herself
xander
interrupts
xander
bounces
his
eyebrows
willow
smiles
they
all
put
on
bright
smiles
and
radiate
them
into
the
bronze
slowly
their
luster
fades
and
they
all
end
up
looking
glum
again
willow
and
xander
both
raise
their
hands
she
gets
up
and
heads
for
the
cappuccino
bar
xander
indicates
cordelia
xander
reaches
over
to

in
his
old
familiar
way
xander
jerks
back
his
hand
willow
shrugs
willow
xander
looks
away
willow
xander
looks
back
xander
understands
but
he
sure
isn't
happy
about
it
buffy
decides
to
follow
cut
outside
buffy
catches
up
with
her
cordelia
stops
and
faces
her
because
if
he
did
cordelia
starts
to
go
buffy
follows
buffy
cordelia
faces
her
suddenly
a
vampire
jumps
down
behind
buffy
and
swings
at
her
head
but
she
middle
blocks
it
and
punches
him
in
the
face
which
sends
him
to
the
pavement
on
his
side
buffy
punches
him
in
the
face
while
he's
down
reaches
for
his
shirt
and
yanks
him
back
up
to
his
feet
she
spins
him
around
and
lets
go
of
his
shirt
he
staggers
backward
a
couple
of
steps
but
keeps
his
footing
he
advances
and
does
two
roundhouse
kicks
which
buffy
low
blocks
he
tries
a
wide
punch
to
buffy's
head
but
she
ducks
it
and
rises
back
up
to
deliver
a
roundhouse
kick
to
his
side
this
sends
him
stumbling
backward
right
at
cordelia
cordelia
has
no
time
to
react
and
gets
knocked
into
a
pile
of
garbage
the
vampire
gets
back
up
to
his
feet
and
comes
at
buffy
jumping
into
a
half
spinning
crescent
kick
which
buffy
easily
ducks
she
grabs
him
when
he
comes
at
her
again
and
knees
him
in
the
stomach
then
flips
him
over
onto
his
back
she
pulls
out
her
stake
and
jams
it
home
the
vampire
bursts
into
ashes
buffy
turns
her
attention
back
to
cordelia
who
flicks
a
few
pieces
of
trash
from
her
dress
and
slowly
climbs
out
of
the
garbage
heap
buffy
looks
at
her
apologetically
behind
her
she
hears
the
laughter
of
a
group
of
girls
so
she
quickly
tosses
aside
her
stake
harmony
and
some
of
her
friends
walk
by
look
cordelia
over
and
keep
laughing
as
they
go
after
they've
gone
cordelia
vents
on
buffy
cordelia
winces
in
pain
and
holds
her
side

looks
in
buffy's
direction
anya
follows
cordelia's
gaze
and
sees
buffy
and
company
sitting
on
a
bench
harmony
interrupts
cordelia
and
anya
dumpster
chic
for
the
dumped
she
and
her
troop
rudely
walk
right
between
cordelia
and
anya
giggling
and
smiling
cordelia
looks
down
in
embarrassment
anya
takes
her
pendant
off
cordelia
lifts
her
hair
away
from
her
neck
and
lets
anya
put
it
on
cordelia
eyes
buffy
anya
looks
over
at
buffy
anya
turns
back
to
cordelia
who
gasps
to
see
that
her
face
has
suddenly
become
very
wrinkled
and
rawlooking
the
embodiment
of
anyanka
patron
saint
of
all
women
scorned
the
picture
fades
to
white
the
picture
fades
from

cordelia
looks
around
her
anya

the
place
is
in
fact
rather
a
mess
garbage
and
palm
leaves
are
strewn
about
the
quad
suddenly
she
notices
that
she
no
longer
has
her
injury
anya's
pendant
however
is
still
around
her
neck
slowly
she
begins
to
figure
it
out
cordelia
smiles
she
was
like
a
good
fairy
a
scary
veiny
good
fairy
smiles
widely
she
laughs
as
she
heads
into
the
halls
cut
into
the
halls
just
like
outside
there
are
far
fewer
students
inside
everyone
is
dressed
in
dark
and
drab
clothing
cordelia
is
the
standout
in
her
bright
turquoise
dress
she
sees
harmony
and
her
friends
at
her
locker
and
hesitates
harmony
closes
her
locker
and
sees
her
she
approaches
cordelia
and
her

follow
cordelia
gives
them
a
careful
smile

smiles
he
heads
down
the
hall
a
happy
man
harmony
steps
over
to
her
he
rushes
out
of
the
room
the
students
also
make
a
point
of
getting
out
of
there
quickly
cordelia
gets
up
harmony
and
her
friends
all
stop
and
give
cordelia
a
disbelieving
look
cordelia
smiles
harmony
and
cordette
exchange
a
look
harmony

cordelia
smiles
harmony
confused
cordelia's
smile
fades

how
she
feels
about
that
harmony
rolls
her
eyes
and
leaves
the
room
cordelia
stops
a
passing
janitor

off
