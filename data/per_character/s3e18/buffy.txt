really
seeing
him
bad
even
pretend
bad
and
with
faith
i
don't
know
to
the
naked
eye
it
looked
like
fun
or
maybe
it
wasn't
maybe
he
wasn't
even
tempted
i
just
wish
i
could
be
sure
think
he'd
tell
me
you're
going
to
the
game
i
didn't
know
you
liked
basketball

another
problem
for
the
good
people
at
lubriderm

in
the
disgusting
flesh

an
aspect
of
the
demon

of
the
demon
i
hope
it's
not
the
outside
part
is
it
me
or
is
this
really
lame
nothing
checking
for
horns
what
if
he
is
right
i'm
suddenly
going
to
grow
this
demon
part
and
we
don't
even
know
what
it
is
it
could
be
claws
or
scales
what
it's
just
i'm
scared
will
there's
this
thing
in
me
and
i
can't
find
it
i
can't
stop
it
what
if
it
changes
me
not
just
the
way
i
look
all
of
a
sudden
i
could
be
something
that's
not
me
anymore
still
gotta
mouth
it's
okay
i
didn't
see
you
so
i
should
have
known
you
were
there
what
are
you
doing
here
yeahfaith
shewell
faith
what
can
ya
say
about
her
and
the
fact
that
you're
right
here
does
that
mean
faith's
around
are
you
keeping
me
safe
by
tracking
me
or
are
you
tracking
her
a
lot
of
things
the
most
recent
being
this
demon
actually
two
i
touched
one
of
them
and
now
i'm
gonna
get
a
big
case
of
the
bumpies
or
a
tail
or
something
you
know
the
drill
demon
hype
maybe
not
i
spend
all
my
time
in
the
dark
here
anyway
it's
not
like
i'd
be
at
a
gain
you
know
with
my
friends
where
someone
could
see
me
and
my
new
monster
part
i
liked
everything
until
that
part
hmmm
quietness
we
either
lost
or
we
won
and
you
don't
want
me
to
feel
bad
well
i
thought
i
saw
a
four
legged
demon
but
it
was
just
a
dog
regular
xander
tough
luck
it
really
bugs
you
huh
cordelia
and
wesley
smooching
i'm
sorry
mr
beech
i
will
is
this
the
thing
the
aspect
thing
because
i
gotta
say
if
it
is
it
is
way
better
than
a
tail
i
mean
i
have
a
hard
enough
time
finding
jeans
that
fit
right
i
know
you
just
told
me
that's
why
they
don't
need
mouths
and
you
should
have
known
it
was
happening
out
in
the
hallway
principal
snyder
has
walk
like
an
egyption
stuck
in
his
head
and
the
boys
at
this
school
are
seriously
disturbed
it's
wierd
but
giles
think
about
it
think
about
what
i
could
do
oh
way
better
than
that
jealousy
well
he
was
passed
over
for
promotion
cassio
was
picked
instead
and
people
were
saying
that
othello
slept
with
his
wife
will
who's
that
guy
well
he
um
he
sort
of
admits
himself
that
his
motive
are
spurious
he
um
he
does
things
because
he
he
enjoys
them
it's
like
he's
not
he's
not
really
a
person
he's
a
the
dark
half
of
othello
himself
i
know
uh
i
mean
i
agree
with
that
oooh
sorry
sorry
about
the
daytime
i
just
ducked
out
of
school
and
that's
when
they
have
it
umyou
look
good
i
mean
i
i
know
i
saw
you
last
night
but
sometimes
things
can
change
really
quick
i
mean
really
quick
listen
to
me
i'm
talking
like
faith
you
know
not
that
she
was
so
bad
to
have
around
you

think
she
was
hurting
a
lot
and
some
people
protective
type
people
might
be
drawn
to
that
i
guess
well
the
thing

few
minutes
okay
here's
the
new
plan
we're
going
to
get
snyder
to
evacuate
the
school
i
just
hope
the
killer's
not
waiting
outside
split
up
find
him
ok
jonathan
you
wanna
point
that
somewhere
else
no
no
no
stopping
just
here
for
view
hey
look
city
hall
never
gonna
happen
i
don't
know
jonathan
i
just
doing
what
i
don't
i
don't
think
about
you
much
at
all
nobody
here
really
does
bugs
you
doesn't
it
you
have
all
this
pain
and
all
these
feelings
and
nobody's
really
paying
attention
no
i
think
you're
up
in
the
clock
tower
with
a
highpowered
rifle
because
you
wanna
blend
in
believe
it
or
not
jonathan
i
understand
about
the
pain
you
know
what
i
was
wrong
you
are
an
idiot
my
life
happens
to
on
occasion
suck
beyond
the
telling
of
it
sometimes
more
than
i
can
handle
and
it's
not
just
mine
every
single
person
down
there
is
ignoring
your
pain
because
they're
too
busy
with
their
own
the
beautiful
ones
the
popular
ones
the
guys
that
picks
on
you
everyone
if
you
could
hear
what
they
were
feeling
the
loneliness
the
confusion
it
looks
quiet
down
there
it's
not
it's
deafening
you
know
i
could've
taken
that
by
now
i'd
rather
do
it
this
way
yeah
well
massmurder
not
really
doctor
recommended
for
that
type
of
pain
besides
prison
you
know
it's
a
lot
like
high
school
only
instead
of
noogies
actions
having
consequences
you
know
stuff
like
that
okay
let's
calm
down
i
don't
see
this
being
settled
with
logic
well
we
talked
and
then
he
ripped
out
the
heart
of
a
demon
and
fed
it
to
me
and
then
we
talked
some
more
loving
the
quiet
nobody
in
here
but
me
pretty
crappy
his
parents
are
freaking
he
got
suspended
and
toting
a
piece
to
school
not
exactly
winning
him
a
place
with
the
incrowd
but
i
think
he's
dealing
well
it's
nice
to
be
able
to
help
someone
in
a
nonslaying
capacity
except
he's
starting
to
get
that
look
you
know
like
he's
gonna
ask
me
to
prom
oh
come
on
what
am
i
saint
buffy
he's
like
three
feet
tall
sure
we
can
work
out
after
school
you
know
if
you're
not
too
busy
having
sex
with
my
mother
