buffy
right
very
good
jealousy
clearly
is
the
tool
that
iago
uses
to
undo
othello
but
what's
his
motivation
what
reason
does
iago
give
for
destroying
his
superior
officer
any
other
reason
uh
good
nancy
can't
overlook
that
there's
something
else
at
work
here
buffy
really
very
astute
i
said
something
quite
like
that
in
my
dissertation
yes
and
doesn't
that
also
explain
othello's
readiness
to
believe
iago
he
believes
that
she's
been
unfaithful
and
we're
all
like
that
we
all
have
our
little
internal
iagos
that
tell
us
our
husbands
or
our
girlfriends
or
whatever
don't
really
love
us
but
you
never
really
see
what's
in
someone's
heart
