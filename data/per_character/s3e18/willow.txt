so
scabby
demon
got
away
i
don't
like
this
whole
no
mouth
thing
it's
disquieting
so
have
you
talked
to
angel
lately
he
only
kissed
her
for
the
greater
good
as
always
i
advise
you
to
ask
hi
ok
did
you
finish
the
reading
percy
that's
my
little
trooper
hogan
i
don't
know
what
you're
doing
to
him
i
actually
heard
him
complete
a
sentence
it
had
a
clause
and
everything
wouldn't
miss
it
i
didn't
either
but
i
really
started
getting
into
it
especially
now
that
we're
in
the
championship
it's
so
exciting
too
bad
you're
patrolling
we're
all
going
oz
xander
everybody
well
according
to
freddy's
latest
editorial
'the
pep
rally
is
a
place
for
pseudoprostitutes
to
provoke
men
into
a
sexual
frenzy
which
when
thwarted
results
in
pointless
athletic
competition'
xander
and
the
downside
being
the
school
paper
is
edging
on
depressing
lately
you
guys
notice
that
what
are
you
doing
buffy
ah
you
know
buffy
i
don't
even
think
giles
is
right
about
you
becoming
like
a
demon
i
mean
he's
totally
burnt
you
know
dealing
with
faith
and
this
ascension
thing
between
you
and
me
he's
not
doing
his
best
work
was
it
a
boy
demon
yeah
woohoosorry
they
spelled
percy
and
and
i
have
to
show
supporthe's
needy
but
i
heard
what
you
were
saying
really
and
i
would
be
frightened
too
but
i'm
sure
you're
gonna
be
okay
could
you
believe
it
right
at
the
buzzer
three
points
for
the
win
man
i've
never
seen
anyone
jump
like
hogan
martin
they
should
call
him

the
jumper
well
yeah
it
wasn't
a
really
good
game
yeah
well
i
still
bet
patrolling
was
way
better
cause
wow
important
that's
freddy
iverson
he
writes
those
editorials
for
the
school
paper
he's
sardonic
well
i
think
it's
great
right
i
mean
you
enjoy
your
other
slayer
powers
yeah
she's
super
competitive
and
you
really
showed
her
what's
it
like
buffy

can't
help

sorry
