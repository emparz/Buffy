i
don't
think
it's
that
bad
i
have
the
best
costume
for
the
dance
what
about
the
beautiful
melding
of
two
cultures
you
just
don't
like
him
'cause
of
that
time
he
beat
you
up
every
day
for
five
years
i
got
it
the
nonviolent
approach
is
probably
better
here
that's
probably
not
something
you're
supposed
to
be
doing
you
could
get
in
trouble
are
we
still
on
for
our
chem
tutorial
tomorrow
there're
a
hundred
and
three
i
hope
this
story
ends
with
'and
she
lived
happily
ever
after'
xander
no
i
think
it
ends
with
'and
she
became
a
scary
discolored
shriveled
mummy'
guide
the
incan
people
sacrificed
their
princess
to
the
mountain
god
sebancaya
an
offering
buried
alive
for
eternity
in
this
dark
tomb
they
could've
at
least
wrapped
her
in
those
nice
white
bandages
like
in
the
movies
hey
guys
no
uh
oh
yyes
no
rodney's
missing
his
parents
say
he
never
came
home
last
night
i
didn't
either
i
hope
he
didn't
get
in
trouble
at
the
museum
right
and
it
rose
from
its
tomb
on
the
other
hand
maybe
rodney
just
stepped
out
for
a
smoke
it's
addictive
you
know
does
that
mean
the
mummy's
loose
giles
were
the
incas
very
advanced
did
they
have
orthodontists
rodney
looked
like
he
had
been
dead
for
five
hundred
years
how
could
that
be
the
way
he
bolted
when
he
saw
rodney
i'd
say
he
was
as
freaked
as
we
were
what
if
he
left
already
so
ampata
you're
a
girl
and
not
a
boy
'cause
we
thought
a
boy
was
coming
and
here
ya
are
in
a
girl
way
new
york
that's
exciting
what
was
that
like
i
worked
really
hard
on
my
costume
it's
pretty
cool
well
it's
a
celebration
of
cultures
there
are
lots
of
dress
up
alternatives
bavarians
are
cool
why
are
you
suddenly
so
worried
about
looking
like
an
idiot
our
archeology
club
boy
they
really
like
each
other
oh
yes
i'm
caring
about
mummies
yeah
and
then
xander
can
find
someone
else
who's
not
me
to
obsess
about
at
least
with
you
i
knew
he
didn't
have
a
shot
well
you
know
i
have
a
choice
i
can
spend
my
life
waiting
for
xander
to
go
out
with
every
other
girl
in
the
world
until
he
notices
me
or
i
can
just
get
on
with
my
life
well
i
didn't
choose
yet
where
does
it
say
that
why's
this
guy
so
into
us
i
mean
what's
he
want
is
she
okay
you
should
take
her
to
the
dance
no
i
mean
just
you
i'll
see
you
there
i
know
i
think
i
should've
worn
something
sexy
wow
you
guys
look
great
thanks
that's
what
i
was
going
for
where's
buffy
i
shrugged
sigh
he's
looking
for
ampata
oh
good
xander
backstage
i
think
he
doesn't
know
