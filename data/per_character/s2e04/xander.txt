well
a
lot
of
parents
are
doing
it
this
year
it's
part
of
this
whole
cultural
exchange
magilla
the
exhibit
the
dance
i
think
the
exchange
student
program's
cool
i
do
it's
a
beautiful
melding
of
two
cultures
my
dad
tried
to
send
me
to
some
armenians
once
does
that
count
by
guylike
we
are
talking
big
beefy
guylike
girl
right
hold
on
a
sec
so
this
person
who's
living
with
you
for
two
weeks
is
a
man
with
man
parts
this
is
a
terrible
idea
there's
no
melding
okay
he
better
keep
his
parts
to
himself
uh
that's
rodney
munson
he's
god's
gift
to
the
bell
curve
what
he
lacks
in
smarts
he
makes
up
in
lack
of
smarts
yeah
i'm
irrational
that
way
the
important
thing
is
you
believe
that
typical
museum
trick
promise
human
sacrifice
deliver
old
pots
and
pans
so
buffy
when's
exchangeo
boy
making
his
appearance
ooo
the
sunnydale
bus
depot
classy
what
a
better
way
to
introduce
someone
to
our
country
than
with
the
stench
of
urine
nooot
with
her
in
the
same
house
as
her
am
i
the
only
one
who's
objective
enough
to
make
that
distinction
so
i
guess
we're
dancebound
cool
i
think
i
can
get
my
mom's
car
so
i'm
wheel
man
well
yeah
i'm
gonna
take
willow
but
i'm
not
gonna
take
willow
in
the
sense
of
'take
me'
see
with
you
we're
three
and
everybody's
safe
without
you
we're
two
lips
buffy
i
love
willow
and
she's
my
best
friend
which
makes
her
not
the
kind
of
girl
who
i
think
about
her
lips
that
much
she's
the
kind
of
girl
that
i'm
best
friends
with
willow
hi
we
were
just
talkin'
about
happy
things
like
the
three
of
us
going
to
the
dance
together
see
happy
not
happy
hey
maybe
he
awakened
the
mummy
for
twentyone
hours
okay
i
just
saved
us
right
maybe
we
should
ask
that
crazy
man
with
the
big
old
knife
uhuhuh
buffy
where
are
your
priorities
tracking
down
a
mummifying
killer
or
making
time
for
some
latin
lover
whose
stock
in
trade
is
the
breakage
of
hearts
oh
yeah
fall
for
the
old
'let
me
translate
that
ancient
seal
for
ya'
come
on
tsh
d'ya
know
how
many
times
i've
used
that
so
do
we
have
to
speak
spanish
when
we
see
him
'cause
i
don't
know
anything
much
besides
doritos
and
chihuahua
ay
caramba
i
can
also
say
that
would
you
like
a
drink
it's
just
one
of
those
crazy
mixups
will
where
did
you
go
your
english
is
very
bueno
well
that
works
out
well
because
i
talk
much
okay
but
what
about
me
i've
gotta
think
and
a
corresponding
equal
number
of
mocking
alternatives
all
aimed
at
me
okay
no
shirts
with
ruffles
no
hats
with
feathers
and
definitely
no
lederhosen
they
make
my
calves
look
fat
stay
with
ampata
for
the
day
i'd
love
to
and
this
is
called
a
snack
food
yeah
it's
a
delicious
spongy
golden
cake
stuffed
with
a
delightful
creamy
white
substance
of
goodness
and
here's
how
you
eat
it
mmhm
that's
why
you
bring
two
good
huh
and
the
exciting
part
is
that
they
have
no
ingredients
that
a
human
can
pronounce
so
it
doesn't
leave
you
with
that
heavy
food
feeling
in
your
stomach
girls
always
tell
me
that
right
before
they
run
away
i
like
you
like
it
please
don't
learn
from
my
english
he
said
'give
me
the
seal'
giles
apparently
this
is
more
popular
than
we
realized
i
just
don't
know
what
we
we
should
do
with
it
you're
right
ampata
and
it's
time
we
do
we're
not
an
archeology
club
we're
in
uh
we're
in
the
crime
club
which
is
kinda
like
the
chess
club
only
with
crime
and
um
no
chess
ampata
ampata
listen
to
me
nobody's
gonna
hurt
you
i
won't
let
them
wigged
i'm
tryin'
to
convince
her
that
our
lives
aren't
just
danger
and
peril
around
here

a
good
idea
we'll
all
go

little
bit
scary

a
lot
and
i
want
you
to
go
to
with
me
the
dance
well
because
you
never
know
if
a
girl's
gonna
say
'yes'
or
if
she's
gonna
laugh
in
your
face
and
pull
out
your
still
beating
heart
and
crush
it
into
the
ground
with
her
heel
