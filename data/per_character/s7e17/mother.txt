oh
william
nonsense
it's
magnificent
i
wonder
though
this
cecily
of
whom
you
write
so
often
would
that
be
the
underwood's
eldest
girl
she's
lovely
you
shouldn't
be
alone
you
need
a
woman
in
your
life
but
you
ne—
oh
i'll
be
all
right
it's
passed
just
sit
with
me
a
while
will
you
early
one
morning
just
as
the
sun
was
shining
i
heard
a
maid
sing
in
the
valley
below
william
where
have
you
been
i've
been
beside
myself
for
days
i—i
don't—
who's
this
woman
i
beg
your
pardon
are
you
drunk
what
are
you
talking
about
aand
why
are
you
acting
so
strangely
william
hello
william
mm
yes
all
better
am
i
well
i
suppose
i
have
you
to
thank
for
that
don't
i
how
ever
will
i
repay
you
oh
william
you're
so
tender
ah
yes
us
pleasure
to
take
my
leave
of
you
of
course
the
lark
hath
spake
from
twixt
its
wee
beak
you
honestly
thought
i
could
bear
an
eternity
listening
to
that
twaddle
i
feel
extraordinary
it's
as
though
i've
been
given
new
eyes
i
see
everything
understand
everything
i
hate
to
be
cruel—
no
i
don't
i
used
to
hate
to
be
cruel
in
life
now
i
find
it
rather
freeing
nothing
less
will
pry
your
greedy
little
fingers
off
my
apron
strings
will
it
ever
since
the
day
you
first
slithered
from
me
like
a
parasite
had
i
known
better
i
could
have
spared
myself
a
lifetime
of
tedium
and
just—
dashed
your
brains
out
when
i
first
saw
you
god
i
prayed
you'd
find
a
woman
to
release
me
but
you
scarcely
showed
an
interest
who
could
compare
to
your
doddering
housebound
mum
a
captive
audience
for
your
witless
prattle
darling
it's
who
you'll
always
be
a
limp
sentimental
fool
you
want
to
run
don't
you
scamper
off
and
cry
to
your
new
little
trollop
do
you
think
you'll
be
able
to
love
her
think
you'll
be
able
to
touch
her
without
feeling
me
all
you
ever
wanted
was
to
be
back
inside
you
finally
got
your
wish
didn't
you
sank
your
teeth
into
me
an
eternal
kiss
you
wanted
your
hands
on
me
perhaps
you'd
like
a
chance
to
finish
off
what
you
started
just
like
this
this
is
what
you
always
wanted
who's
my
dark
little
prince
get
out
get
out
there
there
precious
it
will
only
hurt
for
a
moment
