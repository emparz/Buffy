everything's
terrible
total
catastrophe
have
you
seen
the
new
library
there's
nothing
but
computers
there's
not
a
book
to
be
seen
i—i
don't
know
where
to
begin
buffy
i
mean
who
do
we
speak
to
oh
sorry
rupert
giles
sorry
buffy
tells
me
you're
something
of
a
freelance
demon
fighter
oh
yes
yes
i
um
i'm
relieved
we're
running
dangerously
low
on
allies
uh
no
the
seers
at
the
coven
are
certain
the
first
is
continuing
to
gather
its
forces
i'm
afraid
war
is
inevitable
so
we
should
go
before
the
school
board
well
i
can
have
my
backup
library
sent
from
home
in
the
mean
time
it's
not
much
but—
knowledge
comes
from
crafted
bindings
and
pages
buffy
not
ones
and
zeros
um
no
actually
mmy
uh
my
trip
is
about
something
elseregarding
spike
i
told
you
my
concerns
when
you
recklessly
chose
to
remove
the
chip
from
his
head
uh
it's
a
long
story
and
that
would
be
the
abridged
version
unless
the
first
triggers
him
again
not
anymore
we
don't
know
that
the
trigger
is
inactive
what
i
brought
back
may
help
us
to
disarm
it
to
ascertain
exactly
what
it
is
that
causes
spike's
behavior
he
has
no
memory
of
it
is
there
any
part
of
it
that
you
can
remember
well
it
will
require
a
bit
of
magic
not
exactly
the
first
has
brainwashed
you
there's
something
in
your
subconscious
that
it's
using
to
provoke
a
violent
reaction
so
we
have
to
put
this
in
your
brain
the
prokaryote
stone
will
move
within
your
mind
to
reveal
the
root
of
the
trigger's
power
can
unleash
ideas
images
memories
hopefully
once
you
understand
what
it
is
that's
setting
you
off
you
can
break
its
hold
on
you
the
stone's
just
a
catalyst
for
the
process
the
rest
is
up
to
spike
willow
it
has
to
access
the
cerebral
cortex
via
the
optic
nerve
i
don't
think
it
takes
up
that
much
space
do
you
spike
what
do
you
remember
about
the
song
and
spike
listen
to
me
what
is
it
about
your
mother
well
there
has
to
be
more
than
that
what
are
you
doing
buffy
just—
because
he's
not
cooperating
this
process
takes
time
he's
blocking
whatever's
flooding
his
consciousness
and
what
he
does—he's
endangering
us
all
much
as
ever
think
about
what
you're
doing
buffy
what's
on
your
mind
spike
it
does
seem
doubtful
the
first
simply
forgot
it
had
such
a
powerful
weapon
buffy
would
never
allow
it
i
don't
think
you
have
much
of
an
idea
of
the
watcherslayer
dynamic
you
were
crowley
i
remember
the
name
new
york
based
watcher
resigned
shortly
after
his
slayer
was—
you're
nikki
wood's
son
spike
killed
your
mother
does
buffy
know
this
and
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
personal
vengeance
what
exactly
do
you
propose
i'm
still
your
teacher
buffy
as
adept
as
you
are
as
a
slayer
there
are
always
new
things
to
learn
now
more
than
ever
it's
crucial
to
maintain
focus
on
your
calling
for
what
its
worth
everyone
at
your
house
seemedquite
relieved
at
the
arrangement
um
buffy
uhwhile
i'm
not
technically
your
watcher
anymore
the
fact
that
your
life
is
such
chaos
only
underscores
the
importance
of
the
lessons
i
can
impart
to
you
we're
on
the
verge
of
war
it's
time
you
looked
at
the
big
picture
it
takes
more
than
rousing
speeches
to
lead
buffy
if
you're
going
to
be
a
general
you
need
to
be
able
to
make
difficult
decisions
regardless
of
cost
well
that's
what
we're
here
to
find
out
while
we
work
on
the
basics
don't
kill
him
yet
because
i'm
asking
you
not
to
would
you
let
this
vampire
live
if
he
began
saving
the
world
ah
yes
but
things
are
different
aren't
they
after
what
you've
been
through
faced
with
the
same
choice
now
you'd
let
her
die
no
so
you
really
do
understand
the
difficult
decisions
you'll
have
to
make
that
anyone
of
us
is
expendable
in
this
war
that
we
cannot
allow
any
threat
that
would
jeopardize
our
chances
at
winning
and
yet
there
is
spike
spike's
a
liability
buffy
he
refuses
to
see
it
and
so
do
you
angel
left
here
because
he
realized
how
harmful
your
relationship
with
him
was
spike
on
the
other
hand
lacks
such
selfawareness
you
want
spike
here
even
after
what
he's
done
to
you
in
the
past
and
the
first
is
exploiting
that
to
his
advantage
it's
time
to
stop
playing
the
role
of
general
and
start
being
one
this
is
the
way
wars
are
won
buffyi—i
understand
your
anger
please
believe
me
we
did
what
we—
well
that
doesn't
change
anything
what
i
told
you
is
still
true
you
need
to
learn—
