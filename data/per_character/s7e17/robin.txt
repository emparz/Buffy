just
waiting
for
my
moment
so
it
appears
yeah
it's
been
pretty
quiet
around
here
since
you
shut
down
that
seal
you
just
may
have
stopped
this
thing
buffy
you
call
that
easy
you
know
you're
uhyou're
something
else
miss
summers
you
know
i've
been
watching
you
when
you're
out
patrolling
and
you
um—
you
remind
me
of
my
um
yeah
yeah
what
i
remember
of
her
anyway
uh
that
would—that
would
be
me
hi
i'm
robin
wood
what
wait
sorry
chip
triggers
the
chip
so
he
has
a
trigger
a
soul
and
a
chip
the
trigger
because
the
military
gave
him
a
soul
sorry
this
thing
you
brought
to
keep
spike
from
killing
again
how's
it
work
i
thought
you
might
need
support
what's
it
mean
to
you
so
the
trigger's
still
working
mr
giles
you
got
a
moment
the
same
thing
that's
on
yours
we
got
ourselves
a
problem
yeah
if
that
trigger's
still
working
then
the
first
must
be
waiting
for
just
the
right
time
to
use
it
against
us
yeah
a
while
back
it
slipped
up
it
told
andrew
it
wasn't
time
yet
for
spike
so
whatever
the
first's
ultimate
plan
is
it's
obvious
that
spike
must
play
an
integral
part
in
that
something
needs
to
be
done
buffy
would
listen
to
her
watcher
wouldn't
she
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
raised
by
a
watcher
bernard
crowley
took
me
in
when
i
was
a
young
kid
trained
me
yes
yes
she
knows
my
mother
was
a
slayer
shedoesn't
know
about
spike
does
it
matter
he's
an
instrument
of
evil
now
he's
gonna
prove
to
be
our
undoing
in
this
fight
buffy's
undoing
and
she
will
never—never
see
it
coming
now
i'm
talking
about
what
needs
to
be
done
for
the
greater
good
giles
and
you
know
i'm
right
i
just
need
you
to
keep
buffy
away
for
a
few
hours
this
is
just
a
work
room
kind
of
my
uh
sanctuary
well
i
told
you
it's
my
um
sanctuary
it's
the
hell
mouth
spike
you
can
never
be
too
careful
just
um
stay
away
from
the
walls
and
you'll
be
all
right
no
story
really
just
trying
to
do
what's
right
make
a
difference
how
'bout
you
what
kind
of
man
are
you
spike
yeah
makes
sense
see
you
strike
me
as
the
kind
of
guy
who
just
careens
through
life
completely
oblivious
to
the
damage
he's
doing
to
everyone
around
him
oh
i
know
more
about
you
than
you
think
spike
see
i've
been
searching
for
you
for
a
very
very
long
time
ever
since
you
killed
my
mother
yeah
you'd
remember
mine
she
was
a
slayer
no
i
don't
wanna
kill
you
spike
i
wanna
kill
the
monster
who
took
my
mother
away
from
me
there
he
is
that's
right
dog
fight
back
it
hurts
don't
it
is
this
what
it
felt
like
when
you
beat
the
life
out
of
her
toyed
with
her
when
you
snapped
her
neck
animal
like
you
never
cared
for
anyone
but
yourself
no
one
else
mattered
just
all
about
the
hunt
yeah
what
sorry
you
think
sorry's
gonna
make
everything
right
game
well
i
didn't
sign
up
for
it
you
took
my
childhood
you
took
her
away
she
was
all
i
had
she
was
my
world
shut
up

didn't
know
her

delude
yourself
that
man
still
exists
