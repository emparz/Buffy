to
you
oh
impotent
one
but

not
the
big
bad
anymore
you're
not
even
the
kind
of
naughty
you're
nothing
but
a
waste
of
space
–
my
space
and
as
much
as
i
always
got
a
big
laugh
watching
buffy
kick
your
shiny
white
bum
as
much
as
i
know
i
can
give
you
a
little
bumkicking
myself
right

i'm
here
to
tell

not
even
worth
it

out
of
here
dumb
jock
if
it
wasn't
for
you
he
still
would
be
yeah

bad
too

kind
of
the
cbs
logo
hey
could
this
be
the
handiwork
of
one
mr
morley
safer
i
second
that
revulsion
well
a
demon's
got
some
pretty
hilarious
ideas
about
fun
the
sacrifice
of
three
–
three
people
are
going
to
die
we'll
stop
at
my
place
on
the
way
get
some
weapons
and
i'll
change
into
something
that
isn't
quite
as
anchovy
scented
you
were
trying
to
stake
yourself
is
too
for
one
thing
that's
my
shirt
you're
about
to
dust
for
another
we've
shared
a
lot
here
you
should
have
trusted
me
enough
to
do
it
for
you
what
he
wants
to
die
i
want
to
help
hey
fine
but
you
break
anything
else
while
we're
gone
and
you'll
be
sleeping
in
the
garage
buster
think
of
the
happy
if
we
don't
find
what
we're
looking
for
we
face
an
apocalypse
not
even
a
syllable
of
valios
here
it
goes
‘we
can't
jus
leave
him
here
to
stake
himself
it's
not
right'
that
is
no
not
true
we're
part
of
the
team
she
needs
us
you
had
it
here
okay
first
i
thought
you
were
being
too
hard
on
yourself
but
lets
rock
and
roll
sunnydale
high
these
walls
–
if
they
were
still
walls
what
stories
they
could
tell
eew
mayor
meat
extra
crispy
the
blood

get
the
talisman
they
can't
do
the
ritual
you've
got
the
wrong
man
dude
i've
had
a
lot
of
practice
with
my
lunch
money
okay

guess
i
won
the
demons
they
are
the
sacrifice
no
so

one
of
the
commando
guys
huh

kinda
weird
being
back

it
