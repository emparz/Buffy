hey
i
was
in
the
library
during
the
quake
almost
got
buried
under
some
19th
century
literature
and
i
don't
have
to
tell
you
how
hard
it
is
to
dig
through
some
of
that
stuff
you
okay
well
porter
dorm
is
completely
blacked
out
so
naturally
they
are
dealing
with
the
crisis
the
only
way
they
know
how
'aftershock
party'
they
do
seem
to
be
pretty
generous
with
the
milestones
hey
you
should
ask
riley
to
come
much
carousing
by
flattering
candlelight
anything
wrong
percy
hi
stuff
ii
thought
you
got
that
football
scholarship
to
usc
hi

some
party
huh
oh
actually
oz
is
yeah
catch
you
later
buffy
where
are
you
hello

anyone
in
here
buffy
over
here
i'm
so
glad
you're
here
i
found
him
–
this
guy
on
the
bed
with
me
dead
not
me
dead
he
dead
there
was
so
much
blood
and
there
–
there
was
a
symbol
and
percy
said
i
was
a
nerd
i
guess
we
should
report
to
giles
get
with
the
demon
tracking
it
just
made
me
feel
like
i
was
right
back
in
high
school
i
mean
i
know
the

percy
thing
isn't
really
important
it's
the

dead
guy
on
the
bed
ooh
and
something
else
he
the
dead
guy
waswas
propped
up
like
whatever
killed
him
wanted
to
drain
the
blood
out
of
him
so
i'm
thinking
the
whatever
took
a
bunch
of
the
guy's
blood
with
it
and
i
haven't
been
a
nerd
for
a
very
long
time
hello
dating
a
guitarist

or
i

was
right
it
was
carved
into
his
chest
like
a
big
creepy
eye
no
iit
can't
be
we've
done
this
already
so
what
do
we
do
eew
bones
of
a
child
though
i
saw
that
an
ancient
ritual
–
uses
the
blood
of
a
man
the
bones
of
a
child
and
–
something
called
the
word
of
valios
iit's
all
part
of
the
sacrifice
–
the
sacrifice
of
three
well
yeah

iit's
not
big
with
the
details
though
it
doesn't
say
how
the
world
ends
or
what
the
ritual
entails
exactly
if
he
doesn't
already
have
it
i
mean
who
knows
where
he's
been
what
are
you
doing
what
were
you
doing
xander
it's
okay
we
know
him
we
can't
just
let
him
poof
himself
well
the
shirt
is
kinda
–
not
very
threatening
–
and
the
short
pants
but
you
know
it
could
also
be
because
i
know
you
can't
bite
which
i
guess
isn't
really
what
you
need
to
hear
right
now
is
it
we
can't
leave
him
here
like
this
we'll
have
to
take
him
with
us
to
the
museum
great
no
word
of
valios
you
shouldn't
talk
like
that
yeah
okay
so
you
can't
kill
anymore
but
there
are
other
fun
things
you
can
do
you'll
adjust
i
see
what
you're
doing
you're
trying
to
get
us
to
dust
you
we're
not
useless
we
–
we
help
people
we
fight
the
forces
of
evil
if
we
leave
him
alone
he'll
stake
himself
will
do
i
think
we're
near
the
library
whoa
check
out
the
new
floor
plan
i
don't
see
any
sacrifice
people
i've
got
the
bones
here
spike
spike
not
in
the
hole
passing
by
in
your
gi
joe
outfit
yeah
everything
seems
so
small
–
and
more
charred
and
ruiny
