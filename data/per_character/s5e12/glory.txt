no
i'm
good
it's
okay
try
not
cutting
things
so
close
next
time
understood
cool
take
this
mess
out
with
the
rest
of
the
trash
and
you

have
something
to
tell
me
well
i'm
waiting
meaning
fine
i
have
been
cooling
my
heels
in
this
crappy
little
town
long
enough
sunnydale's
got
too
many
demons
and
not
enough
retail
outlets
yes
and
i
bet
mousy
the
vampire
slayer
has
an
idea
where
it
is
baby
if
that
girl's
the
only
thing
between
me
and
my
key
i
don't
need
much
time
jinx
hey
what's
the
deal
with
your
face
isn't
go
isn't
going
to
help
all
he
has
to
do
is
turn
over
that
tiny
squirming
slayer
girl
i
have
business
to
do
with
her
if
she
knows
where
i
can
start
looking
for
my
key
aah
why
won't
he
help
he
knows
her
he
could
go
to
her

he
could
talk
to
her

he
could
seduce
her
and
bang
the
key
out
of
her
well
of
course
he's
attractive
but
he
drives
me
insane
know
what
i
mean
yeah
that's
it
exactly
oh
sweet
lumpy
minion
you're
the
only
one
that
understands
probably
cause
i
haven't
sucked
your
brain
out
yet
he
makes
me
so
mad
if
i
could
just

get
my
hands
on
him
you
know
i'll
just
find
her
myself
long
day
sweetie
so

this
is
where
the
slayer
eats
sleeps
and
combs
her
hair
oh
so
cute
i
can't
even
stand
it
personally
i
need
more
space
but
uh
this
is
good
for
you
it's
it's
so
quaint
and
buffy
if
i
wanted
to
fight
you
could
tell
by
the
being
dead
already
so
play
nice
little
girl
the
key
why
else
do
you
think
i'd
come
here
see
i
think
you
knew
where
it
is
and
that's
a
good
thing
well
it's
the
only
thing
keeping
you
alive
right
now
because
you
may
be
tiny
queen
in
vampire
world
but
to
me
you're
a
bug
you
should
get
down
on
your
knees
and
worship
me
but
oh
no
you
still
think
it's
neat
having
slayer
strength
ooh
big
deal
stronger
than
humans
who
isn't
i
could
crush
the
life
from
you
as
easy
as
you'd
break
a
nail
but
i
need
the
key
kid
come
here
a
sec
not
asking
twice
no
this
is
between
me
and
my
key
you
just
happen
to
be
the
thing
in
the
way
and
you
are
just
the
darlin'est
thing
i
ever
did
see
in
my
life
what's
your
name
honey
dawn

you
know
your
sister
took
my
key
dawnie
and
she
won't
give
it
back
i
bet
you
know
where
she
put
it
don't

takes
your
stuff
all
the
time
