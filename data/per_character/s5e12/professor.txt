now
rasputin
was
associated
with
a
certain
obscure
religious
sect
they
held
the
tenet
that
in
order
to
be
forgiven
one
first
had
to
sin
rasputin
embraced
this
doctrine
and
proceeded
to
sin
impressively
and
repeatedly
the
notion
that
he
was
in
fact
evil
gained
strength
years
later
when
the
conspirators
who
set
out
to
kill
him
found
it
nearly
impossible
to
do
so
i'm
sorry
there's
a
question
miss
summers
of
course
until
they
rolled
his
body
in
a
carpet
and
drowned
him
in
a
canal
i
can
assure
you
there
is
near
consensus
in
the
academic
community
regarding
the
death
of
rasputin
well
i'm
sorry
if
you
find
these
facts
so
boring
miss
summers
maybe
you'd
prefer
i
step
aside
so
that
you
can
teach
your
own
course
speculation
101
perhaps
intro
to
flights
of
fancy
