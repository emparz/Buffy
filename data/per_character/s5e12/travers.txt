no
he's
quite
right
you
wouldn't
want
to
do
anything
dangerous
turn
the
wrong
person
into
a
badger
well
evidently
well
first
i
thought
we
might
catch
up
no
that's
all
right
i
think
i
can
see
what
you've
been
up
to
oh
yes
i
thought
perhaps
you
were
keeping
that
space
for
the
really
dangerous
items
that
should
be
kept
out
of
the
public's
hands
or
maybe
you
don't
worry
about
that
uh
giles
sorry
but
this
is
just
for
the
duration
of
our
stay
i
think
you
can
see
why
i'm
sorry
it's
just
for
the
duration
of
the
council's
review
miss
excuse
me
you
uh
you
work
here
let's
sit
down
and
talk
about
it
over
here
you
used
to
respect
us
giles
you
used
to
be
one
of
us
touche
but
you
were
on
the
inside
once
you
know
what
sort
of
resources
we
command
we've
discovered
information
about
this
creature
your
glory
some
of
it
is
clearly
vital
the
rest
merely
extremely
disturbing
and
it
won't
be
handed
over
until
we're
convinced
that
you
and
your
slayer
are
prepared
for
it
thus
the
review
it's
not
a
test
it's
a
check
of
her
methods
we
need
to
know
that
this
information
is
safe
miss
summers

good
to
see
you
again
giles
has
just
been
telling
us
of
your
training
regimen
perhaps
you'll
favor
us
with
a
demonstration
while
we're
here
no
need
to
rush
you
we've
already
laid
out
our
project
for
mr
giles
nigel
yes
we
understand
you're
still
taking
civilians
out
on
patrols
buffy

i
can
sense
your
resistance
and
i
don't
blame
you
but
i
think
your
watcher
hasn't
reminded
you
lately
of
the
resolute
status
of
the
players
in
our
little
game
the
council
fights
evil
the
slayer
is
the
instrument
by
which
we
fight
the
council
remains
the
slayers
change
it's
been
that
way
from
the
beginning
giles
well
that's
a
very
comforting
bloodless
way
of
looking
at
it
isn't
it
giles
let
me
talk
to
buffy
because
i
think
she's
understanding
me
glory
is
stronger
than
you
she's
a
more
powerful
instrument
if
you
will
we
can
help
you
we
have
information
that
will
help
pass
the
review
and
we
give
it
to
you
without
reservation
fail
the
review
either
through
incompetence
or
by
resisting
our
recommendations
how
much
do
you
want
our
help
i
understand
you
think
this
is
unfair
but
there
are
factors
which
should
motivate
you
to
go
along
with
the
review
now
i
don't
want
to
do
this
but
obviously
we
could
shut
this
place
down
permanently
of
course
we
do
and
a
great
deal
more
in
fact
if
you
insist
on
fighting
us
we'll
arrange
to
have
mr
giles
deported
within
the
day
never
set
foot
in
this
country
again
now
perhaps
you're
used
to
idle
threats
and
sloppy
discipline
miss
summers
but
you're
dealing
with
grownups
now
am
i
making
myself
clear
these
are
the
qualities
that
the
slayer
must
possess
to
do
her
job
as
if
it
were
precious
now
getting
the
best
of
philip
will
require
agility
listening
to
my
instructions
at
the
same
time
that
will
demonstrate
clarity
and
stamina
and
strength
will
win
the
long
fight
good
luck
yeah
i'll
be
telling
you
what
to
do
how
to
counter
philip's
attack
we
assume
you're
familiar
with
the
japanese
names
for
aikido
and
jiujitsu
moves
how
have
you
been
training
her
yes
well
no
that's
all
right
i
don't
think
we
need
to
see
any
more
physical
tests
for
a
while
we
can
move
on
to
the
real
review
look
into
your
strategies
plans

figure
out
what's
going
on
in
that
head
we
start
at
seven
tonight
give
you
time
to
uh

well
however
you
prepare
well
your
slayer's
twenty
minutes
late
and
counting
rupert
yes
but
when
you're
late
we
can
begin
the
review
at
last
we'll
uh
skip
the
more
obvious
questions
sorry
uh
your
terms
are
acceptable
uh
rupert
when
we
inventoried
your
shop
we
found
a
bottle
of
single
malt
scotch
behind
the
uh
incense
holders
i
think
i
could
use
a
glass
well
there's
a
lot
to
go
through
well
that's
the
thing
you
see
glory
isn't
a
demon
she's
a
god
