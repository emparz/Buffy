she's
still
in
the
emergency
room
yes
uh
well
we'll
uh
we'll
get
those
uh
vampires
later
i
hear
it's
best
tto
play
along
um
ii
think
there's
a
a
phone
oh
well
we're
uh
we're
very
fond
of
her
the
uh
the
telephone
oh
uh
thank
you
well
i'm
sure
she'll
be
uh
she'll
be
fine
thank
you
thank
you
may
we
come
in
it's
it's
tradition
among
um
people
um
grapes
well
did
you
uh
pass
the
night
well
enough
we
were
discussing
um
stuff
saw
what
buffy
aaa
frightened
child
cordelia
have
you
actually
ever
heard
of
tact
hmm
oh
i
don't
know
maybe
look
into
the
history
of
the
hospital
bizarre
incidents
that
sort
of
thing
oh
ii
suppose
so
cordelia
may
be
homerically
insensitive
but
she
may
also
be
right
death
and
disease
are
are
things
possibly
the
only
things
that
that
buffy
cannot
fight
it's
only
natural
for
her
to
try
to
create
aa
defeatable
opponent
what
a
monster
that
grownups
can't
see
doesn't
ring
a
bell
unless
well
sometimes
small
children
do
see
something
we
adults
don't
us
our
true
selves
our
our
our
hidden
faces
stanley
backer
was
his
name
no
our
dr
backer
has
something
of
a
rap
sheet
factor
in
buffy's
observation
that
he
gives
her
the
um
uh
wiggins
i
just
wish
i
knew
what
he
was
doing
to
these
children
uh
well
it
looks
as
if
you
uh
were
on
to
something
the
uh
the
the
girl
tina
um
it's
apparent
that
she
she
died
of
the
fever
simple
enough
but
but
her
records
show
her
improving
and
then
suddenly
deteriorating
www
without
any
apparent
cause
um
this
is
your
work
oh
um
well
it
would
help
ifif
we
knew
what
it
was
iit's
invisible
to
you
but
the
the
children
can
see
it
right
yes
um
fascinating
though
this
is
wwwe'll
call
you
if
we
know
something
i'd
best
head
for
the
library
research
beckons
well
you
two
stay
alert
why
do
i
have
to
have
uh
good
thinking
iii
could
do
with
a
research
assistant
yes
what
uh
it
uh
extracts
vital
organs
to
replenish
its
own
mutating
cells
um
iit
elongates
its
mouth
to
uh
engulf
its
victim's
head
with
its
incisors
it
asks
endless
questions
of
those
with
whom
it's
supposed
to
be
working
so
that
nothing
is
getting
done
i
don't
even
know
if
we're
on
the
right
track
since
this
uh
miscreant
has
only
been
seen
by
select
individuals
there's
a
chance
we
won't
ever
find
a
picture
of
it
i
found
a
picture
of
how
it
kills
let
me
talk
to
her
uh
uh
buffy
are
you
are
you
still
there
uh
the
um
the
kindestod
gorges
by
sitting
atop
his
prey
pinning
it
down
uh
helplessly
buffy
hello
buffy
wwhat
is
it
