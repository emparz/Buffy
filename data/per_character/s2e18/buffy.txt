then
i

go
right
iis
that
the
same
virus
the
kids
have
i
think
they
call
those
balloons
homework
you
know
chocolate
says
that
even
better
chocolate
means
nothing
to
me
not
really
something
happened
i
thought
you
you
know
what
let's
take
a
walk
now
this
part
i
could
get
used
to
yes
stuff
um
you
know
a
girl
died
here
last
night
well
the
flu
i
know
but
there's
this
dr
backer
and
he's
been
giving
them
these
experimental
treatments
ii'm
not
sure
what
he's
up
to
but
he's
a
little
creepy
aand
then
there
was
this
kid
ryan
he
said
he
saw
something
death
yeah
but
i
thought
i
saw
something
i'm
not
sure
i
was
really
out
of
it
but
maybe
it
wasn't
death
maybe
it
was
something
else
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
this
little
boy
ryan
is
afraid
of
something
something
real
as
long
as
i'm
forced
to
stay
here
i'm
gonna
find
out
what
hey
remember
me
why
not
nah
i
already
got
what
you
got
oh
what
you
think
because
i'm
a
grownup
believe
me
i'm
not
that
grown
up
ryan
listen
to
me
i'm
not
gonna
let
this
thing
hurt
you
any
of
you
grownups
don't
believe
you
right
well
i
do
we
both
know
that
there
are
real
monsters
but
there's
also
real
heroes
that
fight
monsters
and
that's
me
i
know
it
wasn't
backer
he
was
clean
he's
dead
this
thing
killed
him
and
not
with
kindness
no
it's
invisible
i
saw
backer
nearly
shredded
and
the
thing
knocked
me
down
but
it's
real
which
means
i
get
to
fight
it
no
one
of
the
kids
uh
yeah
but
i
was
pretty
delirious
i
mean
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
why
would
i
see
it
then
and
not
last
night
no
i
should
stay
here
i
think
my
symptoms
are
flaring
up
'cause
i'm
not
well
uh
i
feel
all
oogy
oh
yeah
but
just
for
a
day
or
sso
giles
see
if
you
can
get
a
mug
shot
on
that
guy
i
need
to
know
what
i'm
fighting
i'll
check
backer's
office
see
if
i
can
find
any
postits
marked
'why
a
monster
might
want
me
dead'
xander
sounds
like
a
plan
course
if
i
find
anything
i
won't
know
what
it
means
so
will
i
never
have
yeah
right
go
know
something
soon
yep
another
person
i
wasn't
in
time
to
save
it's
too
bad
angel
didn't
put
me
in
the
hospital
sooner
there's
something
i
never
thought
i'd
hear
myself
say
hmm
sherlock
would
that
work
till
that
thing
stopped
him
who
is
this
where's
giles
well
can
you
put
him
on
right
so
it
did
kill
tina
backer
was
curing
the
kids
and
taking
away
the
kindestod's
food
what
hanging
on
every
eww
it
killed
celia
we
have
to
get
this
thing
willow
before
it
gets
any
more
kids
but
how
ii
can't
even
see
it
did
i
uh
maybe
my
mind
was
playing
tricks
on
me
i
mean
i
was
crazed
with
that
fever
who
knows
i
have
lots
of
thoughts
the
fever
that's
how
you
see
the
kindestod
that's
why
celia
could
see
it
that's
why
ryan
still
can
it's
the
only
way
i
guess
we'll
find
out
willow
i'm
going
to
do
this
oh
they
really
should
put
that
on
the
label
okay
but
this
better
work
fast
faster
than
that
here's
to
my
health
oh
god
i'm
not
sure
this
was
such
a
good
idea
okay
i'm
okay
the
kids
they're
gone
i
don't
know
maybe
we're
too
late
maybe
they
moved
maybe
i
don't
i'm
burning
up
will
i
think
it's
in
there
it's
going
after
them
we
gotta
get
'em
okay
we'll
get
'em
in
a
second
no
no
it's
not
that
bad
no
no
we
need
to
get
to
the
basement
i
thought
i
might
try
violence
you
make
me
sick
actually
i
think
i'm
starting
to
feel
better
oh
that
would
be
his
neck
and
the
juice
that's
my
drink
oh
mom
i
wanted
crunchy
peanut
butter
aand
i
said
extra
jelly
it's
from
ryan
