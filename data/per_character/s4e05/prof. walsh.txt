these
are
the
things
we
want
simple
things
comfort
sex
shelter
food
we
always
want
them
and
we
want
them
all
the
time
the
id
doesn't
learn
it
doesn't
grow
up
it
has
the
ego
telling
it
what
it
can't
have
and
it
has
the
superego
telling
it
what
it
should
want
but
the
id
works
solely
out
of
the
pleasure
principle
it
wants
whatever
social
skills
you've
learned
however
much
we've
evolved
the
pleasure
principal
is
at
work
in
all
of
us
so
how
does
this
conflict
with
the
ego
manifest
itself
in
the
psyche
what
do
we
do
when
we
can't
have
what
we
want
next
class
we'll
be
moving
on
to
personality
types
and
disorders
for
those
of
you
who
have
done
the
reading

some
time
on
her
hands
as
i
was
saying
we
won't
be
able
to
cover
it
all
in
the
class
but
that
doesn't
mean
it
isn't
work
knowing
and
it
doesn't
mean
it
won't
be
on
the
midterm
now
if
i've
been
unclear
in
any
way
speak
now
good
now
before
you
go
make
sure
you
get

complete
worksheet
