thanks
for
the
relocation
i
perform
better
without
an
audience
you
were
thinking
what
a
little
helpless
coed
before
bed
you
know
very
well
you
eat
this
late
you're
gonna
get
heartburn
get
it
heartburn

that's
it
that's
all
i
get
one
lameass
vamp
with
no
appreciation
for
my
painstakingly
thoughtout
puns
i
don't
think
the
forces
of
darkness
are
even
trying
i
mean
you
could
make
a
little
effort
here
you
know
give
me
something
to
work
with
'cause
of
the
gloating
factor
alone
you
know
we're
all
about
college
now
we've
got
heady
discourse
right
so
if
college
is
so
great
what
are
we
doing
here
and
why
is
it
more
fun
giles
trouble
so
much
for
your
predictable
blanky
theory
will
sorry
yes
but
it's
your
cutting
edge
8tracks
that
keep
you
ahead
of
the
scene
hey
why
not
if
the
stones
can
still
keep
rolling
why
can't
giles
so
oz
what
about
dingoes
when
are
you
guys
here
again
what
do
i
have
to
do
i
know
can
you
believe
it
and
she
wants
me
to
lead
a
discussion
group
next
class
that
means
more
work
right
shouldn't
she
have
a
better
reward
system
you
know
like
a
cookie
or
a
toy
surprise
like
at
the
dentist
great
i'm
ta
bound
right
now
and
then
i
will
catch
up
with
you
guys
check
out
the
rapid
exits
was
it
me
i
thought
that
was
the
point
he
thinks
she's
sexy
he
gets
this
blushy
thing
going
on
behind
his
ears
that's
for
me
only
it
doesn't
mean
anything
so
oz
checks
out
another
girl
he
loves
you
exactly
i'm
sure
oz
is
flogging
and
punishing
himself
this
is
sounding
wrong
before
i
even
finish
look
i
promise
you
in
a
couple
of
days
it's
gonna
be
like
veruca
who
absolutely
oz
just
isn't
the
type
to
stray
not
tonight
anyways
he'll
be
locked
in
a
cage

in
danger

the
deal
one
of
my
professors
said
that
she
was
almost
attacked
by
two
wild
dogs
last
night
under
the
light
of
a
nearly
full
moon
could
be
well
i've
not
seen
anything
about
the
attacks
in
the
newspapers
or
on
the
news
my
next
stop
and
i'll
see
what
i
can
find
out
asap
promise
got
out
huh
any
news
about
attacks
but
i
did
hear
about
a
woman
being
chased
by
two
wild
dogs
you
don't
remember
anything
like
that
do
you
another
wolf
you
know
i
find
wolf
number
two
out
on
patrol
tonight
and
you
might
have
a
roomie
in
there
oz
you
ok
and
if
it's
possible
you
seem
more
monosyllabic
than
usual
willow
are
you
ok
thank
you
i
was
too
far
away
willow
what's
the
matter
thank
you
i
have
to
go
i
have
to
find
veruca
before
the
sun
sets
i
will
though
when
i
do
this
thing
stops
she's
bad
news
do
you
want
me
to
get
you
something
before
i
take
off
kleenex
chocolatey
chocolate
anything
i'll
come
back
as
soon
as
this
is
finished
i
just
want
you
to
take
it
easy
ok
riley
was
right
the
main
thing
is
put
the
blame
where
it
belongs
don't
hurt
yourself
you're
ok
i
love
you
where
is
she
we'll
try
that
then
oz
now
might
be
a
good
time
for
your
trademark
stoicism
or
the
dirty
pile
of
clothing
she
left
on
the
ground
unless
she
wanted
to
throw
you
off
the
scent
there
was
just
so
much
going
on
with
oz
and
willow
and
there
still
is
but
i
just
thought
you
should
know
and
he
was
toting
some
serious
weaponry
the
thing
is
i
saw
some
guys
dressed
exactly
like
him
on
halloween
night
i
just
assumed
they
were
in
costume
but
maybe
they
were
working
i
wanna
know
what's
up
the
guy
got
in
my
way
i
almost
didn't
catch
up
with
oz
in
time
and
as
it
was
i
was
too
late
to
right
now
she
wishes
i
hadn't
giles
i've
never
seen
her
like
this
it's
like
it
hurts
too
much
to
form
words
yeah
i
ran
away
and
went
to
hell
and
then
got
through
it
i'm
kind
of
hoping
she
doesn't
use
me
as
a
model
i
just
don't
know
how
they're
gonna
deal
with
this
