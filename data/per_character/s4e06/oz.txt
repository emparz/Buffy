mmhmm
that's
my
decision
no
veruca
was
right
about
something
the
wolf
is
inside
me
all
the
time
and
i
don't
know
where
that
line
is
anymore
between
me
and
it
and
until
i
figure
out
what
that
means
i
shouldn't
be
around
you
or
anybody
i'll
find
someplace
i
don't
know
my
whole
life
i've
never
loved
anything
else
