oh
don't
worry
about
me
how's
buffy
it's
impossible
to
know
for
sure
losing
dawn
after
all
that
buffy's
been
through

i
think
it's
pushed
her
too
far
into
some
sort
of
catatonia
what
do
you
mean
yes
obviously
but
what
kind
excellent
now
do
we
suspect
there
may
be
some
kind
of
connection
between
ben
and
glory
uh
can
you
uh
it
only
hurts
while
i
answer
pointless
questions
where's
buffy
uh
she's
gone
into
buffy's
mind
it's
extraordinarily
advanced
um
i
was
thinking
we
should
check
on
glory's
victims
while

we're
here
gone
to
uh
perform
her
ritual
with
dawn
and
leaving
us
entirely
clueless
buffy
she's
back
uh
something
like
that
yes
um

well
uh

according
to
these
scrolls
uh
it's
possible
for
glory
to
be
stopped
ii'm
afraid
it's
um

well
buffy
i've
read
these
things
very
carefully
and
there's
not
much

margin
for
error
you
understand
what
i'm
saying
um

glory

plans
to
open
a

dimensional
portal

by
way
of
a
ritual
bloodletting
yes
once
the
blood
is
shed
at
a
certain
time
and
place

the
fabric
which
separates
all
realities
will

be
ripped
apart
dimensions
will

pour
into
one
another
uh
with
no
barriers
to
stop
them
reality
as
we
know
it
will
be
destroyed
and

chaos
will
reign
on
earth
the
portal
will
only
close
once
the
blood
is
stopped

and
the
only
way
for
that
to
happen
is
um

buffy
the
only
way
is
to
kill
dawn
