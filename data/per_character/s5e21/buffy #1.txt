this
was
when
i
quit
will
i
was
in
the
magic
shop
nothing
special
about
it
and
then
it
hit
me
glory's
going
to
win
i
felt
it
glory
will
beat
me
i
wanted
it
to
happen
i
wanted
it
over
this
is

all
of
this

it's
too
much
for
me
if
glory
wins

then
dawn
dies
some
part
of
me
wanted
it
and
in
the
moment
glory
took
dawn
and
this
is
why
what
