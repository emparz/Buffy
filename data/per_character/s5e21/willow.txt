when
we're
older
and
in
chem
class
buffy

what
are
we
doing
here
we
don't
have
time
buffy
you
have
to
stop
doing
this
killing
dawn
because
this
never
happened
you
never
killed
your
sister
in
your
imagination
none
of
this
is
real
yyou're
stuck
in
some
kind
of
loop
buffy
why
are
you
doing
this
no
buffy
leave
dawn
alone
what
is
this
i'm
not
talking
about
this
i'm
talking
about
this
right
here
it
happened
i
know
it's
something
small
but
it's
something
what
i'm
not
you're
the
one
who
keeps
dragging
me
back
here
aand
you
wouldn't
be
doing
that
if
you
weren't
trying
to
show
me
something
buffy
come
on
iit's
your
brain
just
tell
me
what
happened
here
you
did
what
hit
you
you
can't
know
that
why
is
that
what
you
think
i
think
spike
was
right
back
at
the
gas
station
snap
out
of
it
all
this

it
has
a
name
it's
called
guilt
it's
a
feeling
and
it's
important
but
it's
not
more
than
that
buffy
buffys
you've
carried
the
weight
of
the
world
on
your
shoulders
since
high
school
and
i
i
know
you
didn't
ask
for
this
but

you
do
it
every
day
and
so
you
wanted
out
for
one
second
so
what
hello
your
sister
not
dead
yet
but
she
will
be
if
you
stay
locked
inside
here
and
never
come
back
to
us
then
i
guess
you're
right
and
you
did
kill
your
sister
where
you're
needed
are
you
coming
