you
sure
brutally
stabbed
mr
wirth
visiting
professor
of
geology
there's
nothing
in
here
that
bellows
motive
the
mayor
wanted
the
good
professor
out
of
the
way
tying
up
loose
ends
lester
had
something
or
knew
something
be
careful
if
faith
should
show
up
nonetheless
keep
watch
faith
has
you
at
a
disadvantage
buffy
both
actually
different
i
wish
that
was
a
relief
anya
witnessed
an
ascension
gavrock
there
not
too
much
blood
here
you
sure
it
was
her
what
a
carcass
yes
that
would
be
something
that
the
mayor
would
want
to
keep
a
secret
if
it's
the
same
kind
of
demon
he's
turning
into
and
it's
dead
it
means
that
well
he's
only
impervious
to
harm
until
the
ascension
in
his
demon
form
he
can
be
killed
we'll
have
to
run
some
tests
call
the
others
get
them
here
we
need
to
move
him
to
the
safety
of
his
own
bed
before
the
sun
comes
up
did
you
reach
the
council
did
you
explain
that
these
were
special
circumstances
buffy
we'll
find
a
cure
i've
nothing
to
say
right
now
of
course
i'll
call
if
there's
any
change
right
right
the
local
villagers
near
the
volcano
site
made
reference
to
the
legend
of
ollokai
might
be
a
bastardization
of
olvikan
i
know
it's
a
demon
a
very
old
one
might
have
a
picture
yes
very
convenient
