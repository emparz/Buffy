it's
just
nice
to
see
that
some
young
people
are
still
interested
in
reading
in
this
modern
era

what
are
kids
reading
nowadays
the
beast
will
walk
upon
the
earth
and
darkness
will
follow
the
several
races
of
man
will
be
as
one
in
their
terror
and
destruction
aw
that's
kind
of
sweet
different
races
coming
together
that's
one
spunky
little
girl
you've
raised
i'm
gonna
eat
her
whoa
well
now
that
was
a
little
thoughtless
violent
outbursts
like
that
in
front
of
the
children
you

mr
giles
they
look
to
you
to
see
how
to
behave
i
smell
fear

smart
some
of
your
deaths
will
be
quick
if
that's
worth
anything
well

my
commencement
address
it's
going
to
be
one
heck
of
a
speech
applause
applause
well
that
should
keep
her
occupied
for
a
spell
the
ritual
of
gavrock
i
have
to
ingest
several
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
box
eat
well
you
don't
have
to
watch
just
you
know
go
home
take
it
easy

a
big
day

little
firecracker

but
how
often
do
things
go

though
get
some
rest
mmm

a
feeling
the
power
of
these
creatures

suffuses
my
being
i
can
feel
the
changes
begin
my
organs
are
shifting
changing
making
ready
for
the
ascension
plus
these
babies
are
high
in
fiber
and
what's
the
fun
in
becoming
an
immortal
demon

don't
knock
during
dark
rituals
