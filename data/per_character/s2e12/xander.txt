shhhshsh
you
know
what
this
would
work
a
lot
better
for
me
if
you
didn't
talk
are
you
saying
that
you
can't
look
at
me
when
we
do
whatever
it
is
we
do
that's
great
that's
just
dandy
we're
repulsed
by
each
other
we
we
hide
from
our
friends
all
in
all
this
is
not
what
i'd
call
a
big
selfesteem
booster
okay
you
know
what
i
don't
need
this
yes
mmhm
oh
you
wanna
talk
negative
consequence
what
about
the
heartbreak
of
halitosis
i
mean
a
girl
may
seem
spiffy
but
if
she
ignores
her
flossing
the
bloom
is
definitely
off
the
rose
what
about
having
to
feign
interest
in
her
vapid
little
chit
chat
just
so
you
can
get
some
touch
hey
i
know
we
just
met
but
isn't
that
xander
jr
you're
holding
i
think
the
word
you're
searching
for
is
'absent'
well
you
know
it's
the
whole
'sex
leads
to
responsibility'
thing
which
i
personally
don't
get
you
gotta
take
care
of
the
egg
it's
a
baby
you
gotta
keep
it
safe
and
teach
it
christian
values
then
teach
it
that
dreidel
song
yeah
the
only
thing
that
stresses
me
is
when
do
we
tell
them
that
they're
adopted
no
man
of
her
own
how
'bout
this
it
says
nothing
it
means
nothing
this
whole
egg
experiment
thing
is
completely
pointless
'nuff
said
i
propose
buffy
slays
'em
all
in
favor
oh
right
i
see
a
lotta
hunting
getting
done
in
that
mr
whitmore's
out
couldn't
find
an
egg
sitter
or
something
sure
apparently
buffy
has
decided
the
problem
with
the
english
language
is
all
those
pesky
words
you
angel
big
smoochies
or
perhaps
it's
the
burden
of
parenthood
notice
how
seriously
you
two
have
taken
this
egg
thing
that's
exactly
what
i'm
talking
about
you
can't
stress
over
every
little
thing
a
child
picks
up
on
that
which
is
a
oneway
ticket
to
neurotic
city
which
is
another
secret
to
conscientious
egg
care
pot
of
scalding
water
and
about
eight
minutes
yeah
i
know
it
sounds
cruel
but
sometimes
you
gotta
be
cruel
to
be
kind
i
mean
you
can
bet
that
little
xander
here
is
thickskinned
now
no
it's
like
a
short
cut
you
know
when
you
run
a
race
i
resent
that
or
possibly
thank
you
and
what
would
that
be
cordelia
barrette
appreciation
day
it
can
wait
you're
right
there
could
be
a
closet
let's
go
you
guys
look
for
more
clues
we'll
meet
back
here
mm

man's
gotta
eat

bring
the
thing
