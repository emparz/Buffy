is
that
job
security
all
boils
down
to
one
simple
thing
politics
now
i'm
not
a
political
animal
but
you
learn
fast
around
here
or
it's
wham
hello
glass
ceiling
i
mean
it's
not
like
we
work
at
burger
world
or
the
happy
bun
where
the
power
structure
is
simple
no
here
at
the
palace
you
gotta
keep
your
friends
close
but
your
enemies
closer
it's
like
machiavelli
says
you
know
machiavelli
right
i'm
sorry
my
bad
i
keep
forgetting
you
dropped
out
of
college
good
luck
with
that
well
gotta
motor
don't
wanna
be
late
for
night
school
i'm
working
on
my
mba
think
i
wanna
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
cleaning
grease
traps
ooh
don't
forget
to
lock
up
before
you
go
and
the
gum
under
the
tables
be
sure
to
give
it
a
good
scrape
before
you
leave
see
you
tomorrow
and
that's
where
even
your
best
political
minds
can
drop
the
ball
zeitgeist
you're
not
taking
the
pulse
of
the
public
the
next
thing
you
know
you're
lbj
handing
the
house
keys
over
to
nixon
heard
back
from
your
college
yet
all
right
you
know
we're
out
of
special
sauce
no
no
your
turn
up
front
i'll
deal
back
here
you
take
the
customers
hellooo

waiting
