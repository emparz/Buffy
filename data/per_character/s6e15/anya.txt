this
seating
chart
makes
no
sense
we
have
to
do
it
again
we
can't
do
it
again
you
do
it
will
you
stop
wolfing
down
those
chips
one
more
bag
and
you'll
pop
right
out
of
your
cummerbund
you're
not
even
hungry
you're
just
nervous
it's
a
hell
radio
of
course
it
said
that
we'll
never
get
to
the
airport
in
time
to
pick
up
your
stupid
uncle
great
so
he
can
sleep
off
his
drunken
stupor
on
our
newly
reupholstered
couch
why
are
you
defending
him
well
the
gnarals
are
teleporting
in
in
twenty
minutes
if
i'm
not
there
to
greet
them
somebody's
getting
incinerated
well
i
can
only
do
so
much
xander
planning
this
marriage
is
like
staging
the
invasion
of
normandy
no
i've
been
through
too
much
planning
this
wedding
and
it
is
going
to
happen
it
is
going
to
be
our
perfect
perfect
day
if
i
have
to
kill
every
one
of
our
guests
and
half
this
town
to
do
it
cajun
fiesta
so
you
think
that
their
marriage
is
better
than
ours
is
that
it
well
you
haven't
shut
up
about
them
so
our
wedding
is
not
our
marriage
and
that
would
be
the
wedding
but
our
marriage
ah
well
that
works
out
nicely
then
