it's
going
to
be
sunny
and
warm
with
temperatures
continuing
in
the
high
70s
throughout
the
holiday
weekend
and
while
most
of
southern
california
is
enjoying
a
balmy
christmas
an
extreme
cold
front
has
sprung
up
out
of
nowhere
around
sunnydale
where
they
are
reporting
heavy
snowfall
for
the
first
time
in
well
ever
sunnydale
residents
shouldn't
expect
to
see
the
sun
at
all
today
that
cold
front
isn't
going
anywhere
with
temperatures
in
the
high
30s

means
you
better
bundle
up
if
you're
planning
to
go
outside
and
enjoy
the
change
in
the
weather
