hungry
daniel

that
you're
somewhat
in
me
debt
a
man
playing
at

have
a
natural
intelligence
or
a
great
deal
of
money
and
you're
sadly
lacking
in
both
so

how
to
get
the
good
reverend
chalmers
into
bed
and
will
not
notice
the
absence
of

with
me
then
you
must
keep
quiet

sure
mistress
will
believe
your
behavior
beyond
reproach
come
make
a
scene
huh

we'll
be
as
quiet
as
