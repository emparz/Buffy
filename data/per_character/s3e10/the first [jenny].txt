hmm
i'm
impressed
hmm
you
think
you
can
fight
me
i'm
not
a
demon
little
girl
i
am
something
that
you
can't
even
conceive
the
first
evil
beyond
sin
beyond
death
i
am
the
thing
the
darkness
fears
you'll
never
see
me
but
i
am
everywhere
every
being
every
thought
every
drop
of
hate
angel
will
be
dead
by
sunrise
your
christmas
will
be
his
wake
you
have
no
idea
what
you're
dealing
with
