of
it
as
affection
i
suppose
no

have
botched
the
ritual
so
that
cordelia's
necklace
actually
protected
her
from
the
spell
thththat
one
should
be
easily
reversible

of
making
me
ill
why
doesn't
one
of
you
try
to
help
me
i
know
it's
not
love
it's
obsession
selfish
banal
obsession
now
xander
has
put
himself
in
very
great
danger
if
you
cared
at
all
about
him
you'd
help
me
save
him
rather
than
wittering
on
about
your
feelings
now
let's
get
on
with
some
work
now
