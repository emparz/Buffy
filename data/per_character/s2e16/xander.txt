so
what
do
you
think
but
do
you
think
cordelia
will
like
it
okay
big
yuks
when
are
you
guys
gonna
stop
making
fun
of
me
for
dating
cordelia
uh
parallel
universe
maybe
here
the
only
other
person
i'm
interested
in
is
um
unavailable
besides
cordy
and
i
are
really
getting
along
we're
not
fighting
as
much
and
yesterday
we
just
sat
together
not
even
speakin'
you
know
just
uh
enjoying
comfortable
silence
well
this
is
new
territory
for
me
i
mean
my
valentines
are
usually
met
with
heartfelt
restraining
orders
i
wish
dating
was
like
slaying
you
know
simple
direct
stake
to
the
heart
no
muss
no
fuss
well
you're
obviously
not
dating
cordelia
ha
ha
ha
this
time
i'm
ready
for
you
no
'f'
for
xander
today
no
this
baby's
my
ticket
to
a
sweet
dminus
did
you
guys
see
that
in
class
i
think
amy
just
worked
some
magic
on
ms
beakman
maybe
i
should
go
talk
to
her
hey
oh
i
let
buffy
dress
me
well
not
physically
okay
clearly
the
fact
that
i
please
you
visually
has
got
us
off
on
the
wrong
foot
here
let
me
finish
i've
been
thinking
a
lot
about
us
lately
the
why
and
the
wherefore
you
know
once
twice
a
kissy
here
a
kissy
there
and
you
can
chalk
it
all
up
to
hormones
aand
maybe
that's
all
we
have
here
tawdry
teen
lust
but
maybe
not
maybe
something
in
you
sees
something
special
inside
me
and
vice
versa
i
mean
i
think
i
do
see
something
so
okay
not
quite
the
reaction
i
was
looking
for
yeah
okay
do
you
know
what's
a
good
day
to
break
up
with
somebody
any
day
besides
valentine's
day
i
mean
what
were
you
running
low
on
dramatic
irony
well
you
did
ooo
buffy
my
bud
you
will
not
believe
do
you
need
help
amy
good
to
see
you
you're
a
witch
yeah
i'm
thinking
it
runs
in
the
family
i
saw
you
working
that
mojo
on
ms
beakman
maybe
i
should
go
tell
somebody
about
blackmail
is
such
an
ugly
word
yeah
but
i'm
about
to
blackmail
you
so
i
thought
i'd
bring
it
up
what
do
i
want
i
want
some
respect
around
here
i
want
for
once
to
come
out
ahead
i
want
the
hellmouth
to
be
working
for
me
you
and
me
amy
we're
gonna
cast
a
little
spell
yeah
you
know
just
the
basic
can't
eat
can't
sleep
can't
breathe
anything
but
little
old
moi
whoa
whoa
back
up
who
said
anything
about
eternity
a
man
can
only
talk
selftanning
lotion
for
so
long
before
his
head
explodes
the
point
is
i
want
her
to
want
me
desperately
so
i
can
break
up
with
her
and
subject
her
to
the
same
hell
she's
been
puttin'
me
right
i
intend
revenge
pure
as
the
driven
snow
now
are
you
gonna
play
or
do
we
need
to
have
another
chat
about
invisible
homework
alright
oh
come
on
don't
flatter
yourself
i'm
not
gonna
make
a
big
scene
i
just
want
the
necklace
back
no
last
night
it
was
a
gift
today
it's
scrap
metal
figure
i
can
melt
it
down
and
sell
it
for
fillings
or
something
come
on
i'm
not
gonna
add
to
the
cordelia
chase
castoff
collection
i
can
wait
morning
ladies
some
kind
of
weather
we've
been
having
huh
is
this
love
'cause
maybe
on
you
it
doesn't
look
that
different
sorry
my
mistake
i
have
a
plan
we
use
me
as
bait
no
i
mean
chop
me
into
little
pieces
and
stick
me
on
hooks
for
fish
to
nibble
at
'cause
it
would
be
more
fun
than
my
life
yeah
not
really
the
popular
theory
really
well
would
lap
dancing
enter
into
that
scenario
at
all
'cause
i
find
that
very
comforting
okay
uh
you
do
know
that
i'm
xander
right
yeah
it's
funny
and
it's
just
gettin'
funnier
yeah
okay
yeah
oh
yeah
it
bombed
no
biggie
oh
no
no
no
it's
okay
you
know
what
it
was
wrong
to
meddle
with
the
forces
of
darkness
i
see
that
now
i
think
we've
all
grown
i
gotta
go
sure
what
not
really
see
them
what
yeah
uh
i
really
gotta
go
right
now
good
job
high
marks
yeah
but
will
we
were
both
in
footy
pajamas
will
i
i
think
i
know
what
you've
been
thinking
but
this
is
all
my
fault
i
cast
a
spell
and
it
sort
of
backfired
a
long
long
time
too
long
to
do
anything
that
might
change
that
now
uh
this
is
good
how
close
we
are
now
i
feel
very
comfortable
with
this
amount
of
closeness
in
fact
i
can
even
back
up
a
few
paces
and
still
be
happy
see
baseman
please
tell
me
we're
talking
baseball
it's
not
that
i
don't
find
you
sexy
yes
he
is
and
you
should
go
to
him
'cause
he's
me
ii
don't
wanna
use
force
ththat's
it
this
has
gotta
stop
it's
time
for
me
to
act
like
a
man
and
hide
it
it's
me
throwing
myself
at
your
mercy
i
made
a
mess
giles
see
i
found
out
that
amy's
into
witchcraft
and
i
was
hurt
i
guess
so
i
made
her
put
the
love
whammy
on
cordy
but
it
backfired
and
now
every
woman
in
sunnydale
wants
to
make
me
her
cuddle
monkey
which
may
sound
swell
on
paper
but
oh
no
i'm
twice
the
fool
it
takes
to
do
something
like
this
i
get
around
amy
and
all
she
wants
to
do
is
talk
honeymoon
plans
buff
give
me
a
heart
attack
buff
for
the
love
of
god
don't
open
that
raincoat
it's
not
that
i
don't
want
to
sometimes
the
remote
impossible
possibility
that
you
might
like
me
was
all
that
sustained
me
but
not
now
not
like
this
this
isn't
real
to
you
you're
only
here
because
of
a
spell
i
mean
if
i
thought
you
had
one
clue
what
it
would
mean
to
me
but
you
don't
so
i
can't
a
game
i
no
buffy
please
calm
down
what
i
uh
uhoh
buffy
oh
my
god
buffy
can
you
focus
for
a
minute
you
just
turned
buffy
into
a
rat
can
you
i'm
not
going
anywhere
until
you
change
her
back
would
you
quit
with
the
hecate
ooo
there
good
buffy
just
kinda
what
was
that
for
i
didn't
touch
her
i
swear
amy
turned
her
into
a
rat
i
think
we
lost
'em
will
come
on
you
don't
wanna
hurt
me
okay
now
i
really
think
we've
lost
them
buffy's
house
let's
get
inside
i'll
explain
later
she's
um
around
i
uh
whatever
insane
is
it
so
impossible
for
you
to
believe
that
other
women
find
me
attractive
that
is
such
a
well
yeah
okay
good
point
upstairs
buffy's
room
good
the
mob
still
hasn't
found
us
we
should
be
safer
up
here
cordy
get
outta
here
buffy
how
really
it
doesn't
say
'spare
me'
by
any
chance
we
couldn't
just
start
with
a
coffee
a
movie
maybe
gimme
a
nail
none
of
this
would've
happened
if
you
hadn't
broken
up
with
me
but
no
you're
so
desperate
to
be
popular
would've
worked
fine
except
your
hide's
so
thick
not
even
magic
can
penetrate
it
stay
behind
me
your
mom
seemed
to
buy
it
well
i'm
back
to
being
incredibly
unpopular
mostly
but
uh
willow
won't
even
talk
to
me
how
much
groveling
are
we
talking
here
you
remember
huh
need
cheese
c'mon
buffy
i
couldn't
take
advantage
of
you
like
that
okay
for
a
minute
it
was
touch
and
go
there
well
tell
that
to
cordelia
sorry
you're
gonna
be
okay
just
keep
walkin'
oh
sure
they
are
if
it
helps
whenever
we're
around
them
you
and
i
can
fight
a
lot
you
can
pretty
much
count
on
it
