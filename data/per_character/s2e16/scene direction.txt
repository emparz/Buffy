the
cemetery
at
night
the
camera
is
focused
on
a
heartshaped
locket
that
xander
is
dangling
in
the
extreme
foreground
so
that
everything
in
the
distance
is
out
of
focus
and
unrecognizable
the
camera
shifts
its
focus
onto
buffy
sitting
on
a
gravestone
xander
approaches
buffy
still
dangling
the
locket
she
pulls
it
toward
herself
with
her
hand
to
take
a
closer
look
he
yanks
it
out
of
her
hand
and
puts
it
and
his
hands
into
his
jacket
pockets
xander
chuckles
buffy
xander
nods
smiles
and
looks
down
xander
looks
up
xander
grins
and
laughs
then
loses
the
grin
and
exhales
man
that
was
dull
buffy
smiles
buffy
facetiously
almost
really
reassuringly
and
don't
stress
over
the
gift
xander
steps
away
he
turns
to
face
her
again
just
as
a
vampire
rises
from
the
fresh
grave
xander
reacts
quickly
and
jerks
back
as
the
newly
risen
demon
comes
for
him
but
he
trips
and
falls
backward
onto
his
butt
buffy
hops
off
of
the
gravestone
and
grabs
the
vampire
from
behind
as
he
is
about
to
grab
xander
and
throws
him
high
and
away
he
hits
the
ground
hard
his
momentum
carries
him
into
a
reverse
somersault
and
he
rolls
to
his
feet
he
starts
to
come
at
buffy
she
leaps
at
him
does
a
double
kick
to
his
chest
with
both
feet
in
rapid
succession
and
lands
upright
as
the
vampire
staggers
back
into
the
corner
column
of
a
small
mausoleum
buffy
comes
at
him
but
he
blocks
her
first
two
punches
and
ducks
a
third
swing
her
fourth
and
fifth
punches
however
land
on
his
face
but
he
isn't
fazed
he
pushes
her
aside
into
the
wall
of
the
mausoleum
and
after
regaining
his
balance
comes
at
her
again
she
slides
down
the
wall
and
kicks
out
with
her
leg
making
him
trip
and
spin
down
to
the
ground
as
he
gets
up
she
leaps
at
him
with
a
high
kick
and
knocks
him
back
down
again
she
reaches
into
her
jacket
for
a
stake
and
when
the
vampire
stands
back
up
again
and
tries
to
make
a
grab
for
her
she
deftly
plunges
it
into
his
chest
he
immediately
bursts
into
a
cloud
of
ashes
buffy
yanks
the
stake
back
and
watches
with
satisfaction
as
the
ash
rains
to
the
ground
then
she
heads
over
to
xander
and
gives
him
a
hand
back
up
to
his
feet
