i
was
just
thinking
about
the
life
of
a
pumpkin
grow
up
in
the
sun

happily
entwined
with
others
then
someone
comes
along
cuts
you
open
and

rips
your
guts
out
the
scary
house
sounds
kinda
lame
i'm
gonna
get
going
i'm
sleepy
you
guys
have
fun
no
i'm
fine
that's
what
i'd
like
to
know
what's
the
next
level
well
no
one's
pushing
you
know
if
it's
too
much
don't
do
it
this
is
an
'encouragement'
talk
i
thought
it
was
'share
my
pain'
magic
see
concerned
boy
sweet
boy
you
know
i
uhm
i
forgot
–
to
be
hungry

just
don't
want
to
deal
with
this
right
now
i'm
taking
a
holiday
from
dealing
happily
vacationing
in
the
land
of
not
coping
willow
i
don't
want
to
meet
someone
i've
reached
my
quota
on
someone's
besides
i
think
i'm
gonna
have
to
patrol
anyway
i'll
doublecheck

to
think
i
should
be
on
active
slayer
duty
he
doesn't
care
about
halloween
oh
–
my
–
god
and
it's
on
your
head
what's
going
on
here
you
hate
halloween
i
was
thinking
that
i
should
patrol
tonight
you
know
possibly
the
cemetery
or
if
you
had
a
better
su
could
you
please
take
that
off
no
but
then
you
know
we
were
all
caught
of
guard
when
ethan
turned
everyone
into
their
costumes
hard
to
believe
excuse
me
professor
walsh
i
came
to
get
today's
assignments
i
uh
couldn't
make
it
to
class
for
personal
reasons
yeah
i
got
the
impression
she
wasn't
saying
it
to
make
me
laugh
does
stretching
count
both
actually
thanks
i'll
get
this
done
tonight
i
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
that's
actually
a
misnomer

are
you
doing
scary
well
thanks
for
the
pep
talk
coach
no
i
mean
it
thanks
again
for
doing
this
at
the
last
minute
oh
it
feels
better
oh
no
someone
is
getting
nostalgic
face
yeah
little
red
riding
hood
was
the
cutting
edge
in
costumes
he
was
such
a
pain
12
years
old
and
i
can't
go
trickortreating
by
myself
no
he
wanted
the
candy
i
was
just
the
beard
not
enough
i
guess
oh
that
just
paved
right
over
memory
lane
huh
i
don't
know
–
i'm
starting
to
feel
like
there
is
a
pattern
here
–
open
your
heart
to
someone
and
he
bails
on
you
maybe
it's
easier
to
just
not
let
anyone
in
why
not
weapons'
just
in
case
like
the
tux
xander
i
hate
to
break
it
to
you
but
you'll
probably
end
up
cool
head
waiter
guy
will
medieval
will
nice
costumes
very
stealthy
perfect
everybody's
got
a
date
but
thirdwheel
buffy
terrifying
if
i
were
abbott
and
costello
this
would
be
fairly
traumatic
yeah
lets
get
to
the
party
part
of
the
–
party
blood
real
blood

do
you
hear
something
like
a

just
went
in
a
circle
