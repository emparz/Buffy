anya
to

she's
having
some
trouble
finding

there
technically
speaking
you're

fifth

it's
just
a
neat
trick
you

something
done
with
wires
or
or
it
might
be
something
else
where
is
the
stairs
my
turn
does
anyone
hear
that
like
i
said
sounds
like
a
hissing
i
thought

word
hissing
kind
of
covered
that
nicely
he's
in
shock
let
me
see
let's
all
take
a
breath
buffy
maybe
well
that
was
a
bunch
of
laughs
look
buffy
we
are
all
tired
and
a
little
edgy
maybe
willow
is
overreacting
i'm
sure
part
of
it
is
because
of
how
you've
been
'pushing
away'
girl
lately
but
now
is
not
the
time
to
let
that
stuff
tear
us
apart
what
i'm
saying
is
i'm
right
with
ya
i'm
right
by
your
side
i'm
funny
how
you
still
haven't
lost
your
sense
of
inappropriate
humor

over
i'm
right
here

just
have
to
live
with
the
fact
that
no
one
else
can
see
me

offer
my
opinion
