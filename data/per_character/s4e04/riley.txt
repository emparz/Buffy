she
means
it
you
know
you've
got
to
be
aware
your
work's
taken
a
little
down
turn
lately
i
can't
remember
the
last
time
i've
seen
your
hand
up
look
things
get
pretty
intense
freshmen
year

as
i
dimly
recall
too
much
fun
or
not
enough
yeah
well

just
got
to
keep
your
priorities
prof
walsh
is
worth
your
time
tonight
it's
halloween
what
you're
not
going
to
dress
up
and
go
party
i
may
be
out
of
line
here
and
it's
not
really
my
business
but

you
seem
like
the
kind
of
person
that
makes
things
really
hard
on
themselves
halloween
isn't
a
night
for
responsibility
it's
when
the
ghosts
and
goblins
come
out
well
i
didn't
mean
real
ones
but
hey
there
is
some
good
scary
fun
to
be
had
on

going
to
sit
here
and

and
hard
to
get
this
pompous
