oh
i'm
sorry
that
must
be
hard
really
'cause
i
got
the
impression
that
you
enjoyed—you
know
inflicting
is
it
like
you're
scared
of
losing
that
feeling
again
and
that
having
it
be
ok
to
hurt
people
and
then
you're
not
in
charge
of
the
power
anymore
because
it's
in
charge
of
you
i
get
it
believe
me
you
too

have
to
find
this
monster

the
powers
from
my
enemy

be
immune
to
magic
but

got
more
than

new
skin
it's
magic
i'm
drawing
power
from
the
earth
to
heal
myself
you
know
giles
says
everything's
part
of
the
earth
this
bed
the
air
us
plus
you
stuck
your
thumbs
in
a
demon
no
please
stay
i
missed
you
so
much
when
i
couldn't
find
you
i
did
it
i
didn't
mean
to
ii
just
remember
thinking
i
wasn't
ready
to
see
you
guys
yet
i
was
afraid
we
wouldn't
you
know
connect
guess
i
have
a
ways
to
go
before
i
master
my
powers
huh
it's
nice
to
be
forgiven
too
bad
i
need
so
much
of
it
i
know
he
did
a
little
heck
i
did
a
little
xander
has
the
luxury
of
not
saying
it
but
you're
the
slayer
you
have
to
say
stuff
like
that
it's
ok
it's
ok
too
if
you
still
don't
think
i
can
recover
from
this
magic
stuff
'cause
honestly
i'm
not
that
sure
about
it
either
it
hurts
too
much
not
to
try
it
just
takes
so
much
strength
i
don't
have
that
much
are
you
sure
much
