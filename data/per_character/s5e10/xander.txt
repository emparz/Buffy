there's
a
clock
behind
you
will
buffy's
pretty
cool
like
that
so
what
do
you
wanna
do
now
dawnster
keeping
in
mind
that
i
won't
chase
you
because
i'm
old
and
i'm
stuffed
full
of
moo
goo
gai
starch
and
after
we
teach
her
to
gamble
maybe
we
can
all
get
drunk
okay
how's
about
a
movie
they're
showing
them
in
theaters
now
i
hear
it's
like
watching
a
video
with
a
bunch
of
strangers
and
a
sticky
floor
the
chimp
playing
hockey
is
that
based
on
the
chekhov
you
pick
dawn
this
is
your
night
we
are
celebrating
your
mom's
good
news
no
that's
not
that's
not
it
at
all
they
just
need
time
to
uh
be
tender
relax
that's
generally
what
happens
when
you
cut
them
off
the
chicken
anya
you
can
back
off
a
little
you
get
paid
willow's
doing
this
on
her
own
time
anya
play
nice
only
in
an
erotic
penthousey
way
not
in
a
spongebathy
geriatric
sort
of
now
i
know
what
to
get
for
the
person
who
has
everything
why
don't
the
vampires
just
kill
'em
what's
the
rush
buff
if
we're
going
into
a
nest
maybe
we
should
come
up
with
a
strategy
wait
for
riley
well
i
guess
everybody
jumped
ship
once
the
word
got
out
that
the
slayer
found
their
crib
i
just
want
to
apologize
for
the
use
of
the
word
'crib'
buffy
do
you
think
they'll
set
up
shop
again
in
town
yeah
i'm
sure
you'll
get
them
next
time
champ
how
long
has
she
been
in
there
yeah
when
we
went
to
deal
with
that
vampire
nest
she
got
all
rambo
and
torched
the
place
something
seriously
bad
is
going
on
with
her
can
you
stop
being
scary
for
a
minute
and
listen
to
what
i'm
trying
to
tell
you
she's
training
not
now
let's
go
anya
anya
in
your
world
maybe
but
where
the
people
are
this
isn't
the
time
for
'tales
of
anya
and
xander's
sexcapades'
anya
oh
uh
well
maybe
we
can
go
home
and
you
know
have
'em
actually
i've
got
some
stuff
to
take
care
of
so
how'd
that
work
out
for
ya
make
you
feel
better
i
thought
you
might
need
to
talk
then
i
saw
the
skirmish
happen
i
was
gonna
lend
a
hand
but
i
noticed
you
grew
a
few
extra
ones
buffy
so
am
i
something's
up
you're
acting
like
a
crazy
person
take
this
for
instance
you
don't
wanna
deal
so
you
hide
it's
not
very
slayerlike
no
good
so
you
and
riley
aren't
imploding
it
doesn't
take
a
genius
what
i
can't
figure
out
is
how
you
never
saw
it
coming
nobody
told
me
anything
buffy
it
was
right
in
front
of
my
xander
face
the
guy
would
do
anything
for
you
you
gonna
let
him
go
of
course
it
is
who
cares
if
it's
fair
in
about
twenty
minutes
riley's
gonna
disappear
maybe
forever
unless
you
do
something
to
stop
him
why
wouldn't
you
to
keep
riley
here
buffy
i
don't
even
know
who
he
is
anymore
i
mean
i
thought
he
was

dependable
dependable
what
is
he
state
farm
yeah
i
think
you
mean
convenient
i
think
you
took
it
for
granted
that
he
was
gonna
show
up
when
you
wanted
him
to
and
take
off
when
you
didn't
oh
boy
is
this
not
about
me
if
you
don't
wanna
hear
what
i
have
to
say
i'll
shut
up
right
now
i
lied
see
what
i
think
you
got
burned
with
angel
then
riley
shows
up
but
you
miss
the
point
you
shut
down
buffy
and
you've
been
treating
riley
like
the
rebound
guy
when
he's
the
one
that
comes
along
once
in
a
lifetime
he's
never
held
back
with
you
he's
risked
everything
and
you're
about
to
let
him
fly
because
you
don't
like
ultimatums
if
he's
not
the
guy
if
what
he
needs
from
you
just
isn't
there
let
him
go
break
his
heart
and
make
it
a
clean
break
but
if
you
really
think
you
can
love
this
guy

i'm
talking
scary
messy
noemotionsbarred
need

if
you're
ready
for
that

then
think
about
what
you're
about
to
lose
run
'cause

i
don't
think
i've
made
it
clear
i'm
in
love
with
you
powerfully
painfully
in
love
the
things
you
do

the
way
you
think

the
way
you
move

i
get
excited
every
time
i'm
about
to
see
you
you
make
me
feel
like
i've
never
felt
before
in
my
life
like
a
man
i
just
thought
you
might
wanna
know
