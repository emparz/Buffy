think
i'll
look
like
i

a
cat
on
my
head

stick
with
a
scarf

must
be
getting
better
'cause
you're
making
fun
of
me

have
more
important
things
to
make
up
i
know
you've
been
missing
a
lot
of
school
well
what
about
slaying
and
your
friends
i
want
you
to
have
your
life
back
fair
enough
but
you
don't
have
to
keep
me
company
all
night
go
out
have
fun
get
get
riley
to
take
you
to
a
movie
or

thinks
of
you
as
a
chore

mean
just
as
long
as

two
of
you
are
spending
some
quality
time
