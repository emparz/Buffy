when
i
was
younger
i
used
to
put
my
chopsticks
in
my
mouth
like
this
and
then
buffy
would
chase
me
around
the
house
yelling
'i'm
the
slayer
i'm
going
to
get
you'
no
it
was
great
i
mean
she
didn't
actually
stake
me
in
the
heart
you
know
for
you
you
always
win
that
one
looks
sad
um
no
the
other
one
i
don't
wanna
see
a
sad
movie
it's
okay
you
guys
don't
have
to
make
a
big
deal
for
me
i'm
only
sleeping
over
here
so
buffy
and
riley
can
boink
'alone
time'
always
translates
into
'get
dawn
out
of
the
house
so
we
can
have
loud
obnoxious
sex'
xander
looks
like
he
wants
to
object
but
doesn't
anya
smiles
then
suddenly
realizes
something
