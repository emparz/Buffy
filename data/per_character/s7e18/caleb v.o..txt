now
it's
a
simple
story
stop
me
if
you've
heard
it
i
have
found
and
truly
believe
that
there
is
nothing
so
bad
it
cannot
be
made
better
with
a
story
and
this
one's
got
a
happy
ending
there
once
was
a
woman
and
she
was
foul
like
all
women
for
adam's
rib
was
dirty—just
like
adam
himself—for
what
was
he
but
human
but
this
woman
she
was
filled
with
darkness
despair
and
why
because
she
did
not
know
she
could
not
see
'cause
they
followed
her
and
all
they
have
to
do
is
take
one
more
step
and
i'll
kill
them
all
see
i
told
you
it
had
a
happy
ending
