are
you
ok
can
you
hear
me
can
you
talk
this
girl's
bleeding
badly
we
have
to
get
her
to
the
hospital
don't
know
seems
to
fit
though
we'll
know
more
when
she
regains
consciousness
yeah
faith
you
were
in
prison
figured
you
were
safe
there
sorry
i
don't
know
much
about
the
big
house
was
it—
i
mean
did
something
happen
in
there
oh
faith
we
didn't—
uh
i
guess
we
should
find
buffy
tell
her
what's
going
on
ii
tried
calling
home
dawn
says
she's
out
patrolling
wait
somebody
should
wait
here
in
case
she
wakes
up
wwwait
uh
maybe
you
meeting
buffy
alone
isn't
the
best
idea
yeah
but
it's
not
like
you're
study
buddies
exactly
maybe
it'd
be
better
if
ieased
her
into
the
whole
thing
we
don't
even
know
where
we're
going
yeah
he
lures
us
away
and
then
kills
the
girls
we
leave
behind
