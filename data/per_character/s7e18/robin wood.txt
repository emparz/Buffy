no
i
don't
but
i'll
be
ok
unless
of
course
you
start
beating
up
on
me
now
thanks
that
means
a
lot
absolutely
you're
fired
effective
immediately
buffy
there's
nothing
here
for
you
i
mean
people
are
leaving
town
half
the
kids
don't
even
bother
showing
up
anymore
you've
got
things
to
deal
with
that
are
much
worse
than
anything
here
look
at
the
big
picture
not
dead
not
dead
not
if
you
get
them
ready
most
wars
aren't
you
know
then
i
guess
maybe
you
should
test
them
and
you're
fired
again
remember
buffy
the
mission's
what
matters
