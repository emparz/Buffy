sorry
faith
i
didn't
realize
that
was
you
you
ok
he's
with
me
he
has
a
soul
sort
of
he
fights
on
my
side
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
for
some
of
us
that's
one
of
the
bad
guys
nice
to
have
you
back
yeah
well
every
piece
of
furniture's
been
destroyed
and
replaced
since
you
left
so
actually
new
house
we
have
a
new
house
guest
look
i
need
to
get
to
the
hospital
some
girl
was
attacked
on
her
way
into
town
we
think
she
might
be
a—
fine
you
look
better
no
you
don't
i
won't
well
i
thought
about
it
i
made
some
doodles
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
we're
on
even
ground
i
meant
what
i
said
i
don't
have
time
for
your
vendetta
but
i
need
you
in
this
fight
i
want
you
on
my
side
so
we're
good
what
you're
firing
me
i
just
refrained
from
kicking
your
ass
right
the
big
picture
the
one
with
the
big
war
and
the
dead
little
girls
i
don't
want
to
lead
them
into
war
it
can't
be
the
right
thing
some
of
these
girl
haven't
even
been
tested
in
battle
couldn't
i
just
come
to
work
parttime
i
could
make
flyers
for
encounter
groups
and
post
them
up
all
over
school
well
it's
nice
to
see
you
two
getting
along
so
well
yeah
i
kind
of
decided
to
cut
back
on
my
hours
down
here
figured
i'd
be
better
off
focusing
on
what's
going
on
around
here
he—he
picked
you
up
on
the
side
of
the
road
what
is
it
we've
got
a
new
player
in
town
dresses
like
a
preacher
calls
himself
caleb
looks
like
he's
working
for
the
first
he's
taunting
us
calling
us
out
says
he's
got
something
of
mine
could
be
another
girl
could
be
something
else
don't
know
don't
care
i'm
tired
of
talking
i'm
tired
of
training
he's
got
something
of
mine
fine
i'm
getting
it
back
and
you
guys
are
coming
with
me
we
need
to
start
arming
the
girls
i
wanna
be
ready
to
move
when
we
find
him
's
why
i
figured
we'd
do
a
little
recon
first
you
up
for
it
it
could
be
a
girl
a
potential
trying
to
get
to
us
going
in
anyway
then
it's
time
we
test
them
look
i'll
just
take
the
ones
that
have
been
here
the
longest
the
rest
can
stay
behind
i
know
that's
why
i
need
you
to
stay
here
with
them
you're
my
most
powerful
weapon
will
i
know
you
can
keep
them
safe
if
anything
happens
he
won't
be
expecting
a
full
attack—not
this
soon
that's
why
we
have
to
move
giles
we
don't
have
time
and
you're
not
going
into
battle
i
need
you
to
stay
behind
with
the
others
help
the
girls
who
still
need
a
teacher
or
something
i
guess
pretty
good
when
they
attack
well
normally
they
show
up
out
of
nowhere
and
then
either
stab
or
get
stabbed
and
then
they
run
off
looks
like
this
guy
wants
to
be
found
i'm
through
waiting
around
for
people
to
attack
us
they're
potential
slayers
just
like
we
were
they're
getting
better
why
did
you
come
back
no
that's
not
what
i
meant
i'mglad
that
you're
here
it's
good
thank
you
willow
said
you
helped
out
angel
really
how
is
he
you
were
in
angel's
mind
look
there's
more
of
them
let's
get
the
cavalry
well
you
always
were
a
little
slow
all
right
let's
saddle
up
ok
set
up
a
perimeter
guard
the
door
i
don't
want
anything
getting
in
behind
us
my
team
goes
in
first
we
check
the
place
out
you
guys
are
our
safetynet
if
this
place
is
a
trap

give
the
signal

in
guns
ablazing
i'm
thinking

and
lots
of
yelling

looks
like
an
old
vineyard

alert
