trouble
is
we
don't
know
which
demon
he
is
going
to
become
so
it's
safe
to
say
we
shouldn't
waste
any
time
of
such
trifling
matters
as
a
school
dance
except
of
course
on
the
actual
night
i
will
be
aiding
mr
giles
in
his
chaperoning
duties
if
i'm
not
mistaken
this
is
a
hellhound
perhaps
we
could
stay
on
the
topic
for
once
what
were
you
doing
this
afternoon
let
me
guess
he
was
quiet
kept
to
himself
but
always
seemed
like
a
nice
young
man
alright
perhaps
strength
in
numbers
would
be

if
that's
your
plan
alright
alright
what
about
the
others
magic
shop
well
i
must
say
this
is
all
rather
odd
to
me
no
of
course
not
unless
you
count
the
nights
you
made
the
lower
classmen
get
up
as
girls
and
watched
them

dip
is
tasty
isn't
it
sauce
is
hot
very
hot
may
i
say
you
look
smashing
very
well
thank
you
mr
giles
i'd
like
your
opinion
while
the
last
thing
i
want
to
do
is
muddle
bad
behavior
in
front
of
impressionable
youth
i
wonder
if
asking
miss
chase
to
dance
would
right
then
thanks
for
that
