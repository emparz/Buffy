i'm
sorry
to
uh
well
i
would
have
called
but
you
know
my
goodness
your
place
is
amazing
no
you
wouldn't
oh
no
thank
you
i
uh
you
don't
drink
beverages
i
mean
oh
i
understand
buffy
spent
the
night
i
i'm
not
interested
in
the
details
that's
not
why
i'm
here
i'm
here
because
i'm
worried
about
you
two
in
general
that's
not
all
i'm
concerned
about
i
don't
have
to
tell
you
that
you
and
buffy
are
from
different
worlds
she's
had
to
deal
with
a
lot
grew
up
fast
sometimes
even
i
forget
that
she's
still
just
a
girl
she's
just
starting
out
in
life
good
because
when
it
comes
to
you
angel
she's
just
like
any
other
young
woman
in
love
you're
all
she
can
see
of
tomorrow
but
i
think
we
both
know
that
there
are
some
hard
choices
ahead
if
she
can't
make
them
you're
gonna
have
to
i
know
you
care
about
her
i
just
hope
you
care
enough
