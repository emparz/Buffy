or
something
where
you
going
no
mirrors
i
think
you
look
perfect
mmmm
that's
right
the
prom
right
i
think
maybe
you
should
go
hunh
mrs
summers
please
you're
always
welcome
yeah
i
like
a
lot
of
space
i
don't
get
out
much
during
the
day
can
i
get
you
something
i
don't
have
any
coffee
no
i
do
it's
just
the
caffeine
it
makes
me
jittery
i'm
sorry
about
that
we
came
back
after
patrol
okay
what
happened
before
when
i
changed
it
won't
happen
again
no
you
don't
i'm
old
enough
to
be
her
ancestor
i
know
i
think
about
it
more
now
that
she's
staying
in
sunnydale
i'm
sure
i
saw
him
come
down
here
what
can
i
say
i
need
closure
since
when
did
patrolling
go
black
tie
we
have
more
important
things
to
think
about
right
now
than
a
dance
buffy
come
on
don't
be
that
way
i'm
sorry
i'm
just
worried
that
you're
getting
tooinvested
in
this
whole
thing
i
know
it's
uh
it's
nothing
i
think
we
need
to
talk
but
not
now
and
not
here
i've
been
thinking
about
our
future
and
the
more
i
do
the
more
i
feel
like
us
you
and
me
being
together
is
unfair
to
you
he
was
right
you
deserve
more
you
deserve
something
outside
of
demons
and
darkness
you
should
be
with
someone
who
can
take
you
into
the
light
someone
who
can
make
love
to
you
you
will
and
children
today
but
you
have
no
idea
how
fast
it
goes
buffy
before
you
know
it
you'll
want
it
all
a
normal
life
right
you'll
always
be
a
slayer
but
that's
all
the
more
reason
why
you
should
have
a
real
relationship
instead
of
this
this
freak
show
i
didn't
mean
that
i'm
sorry
buffy
you
know
how
much
i
love
you
it
kills
me
to
say
this
have
you
rationally
i'm
trying
to
do
what's
right
here
okay
i'm
trying
to
think
with
my
head
instead
of
my
heart
don't
i
don't
it
doesn't
mean
that
i
don't

i'm
leaving
after
the
ascension
after
it's
finished
with
the
mayor
and
faith
if
we
survive
i'll
go
i
don't
know
what
are
you
doing
here
sorry
i'm
just
surprised
how
are
you
if
it
means
anything
i
miss
you
you
still
planning
to
go
let
me
help
you
if
you
ever
need
my
help
it's
a
big
night
i
didn't
want
to
miss
it
it's
just
tonight
it
doesn't
mean
that
i

dance
with
me
