she's
sad
because
her
lover
gave
her
twelve
gold
coins
but
then
the
wizard
cut
open
the
bag
of
salt
and
now
the
dancing
minions
have
nowhere
to
put
their
big
maypole
fish
thing
because
of
that
thing
he
did
with
her
feet
no
that
was
personal
i
know
we
could
go
to
the
bronze
and
sneak
in
our
own
tea
bags
and
ask
for
hot
water
you
dreamed
about
angel
again
what
did
he
do
in
the
dream
oh
stuff
was
it
one
of
those
vivid
dreams
where
you
could
feel
his
lips
and
smell
his
hair
you
two
are
so
right
for
each
other
except
for
the
uh
that
doesn't
make
him
a
bad
person
necessarily
not
during
the
day
but
you
could
ask
him
for
coffee
some
night
it's
the
nonrelationship
drink
of
choice
it's
not
a
date
it's
a
caffeinated
beverage
okay
sure
it's
hot
and
bitter
like
a
relationship
that
way
but
and
you
skipped
three
classes
aren't
you
supposed
to
be
doing
your
homework
in
the
library
jeez
yeah
with
their
charmed
lives
and
their
movie
star
good
looks
and
more
money
than
you
can
count
i'm
hating
you're
going
to
the
fraternity
party
what
made
you
change
your
mind
he's
going
with
you
she's
got
a
date
with
angel
isn't
that
exciting
cordelia
did
i
sound
a
little
jealous
just
then
'cause
i'm
not
really
cordelia
what
happened
with
angel
i
don't
understand
i
mean
he
likes
you
more
than
likes
the
frat
guy
i've
seen
something
like
that
before
in
sunnydale
what
a
surprise
you
lied
to
giles
like
you
don't
have
a
sick
mother
but
you'd
rather
go
to
a
frat
party
where
there's
gonna
be
drinking
and
older
guys
and
probably
an
orgy
i
heard
a
lot
of
wild
things
go
on
at
frat
parties
i
can't
believe
she
lied
to
giles
my
world
is
all
askew
askew
means
cockeyed
well
there's
nothing
we
can
do
about
it
we'll
help
giles
what
you
wanna
protect
her
and
prove
that
you're
just
as
good
as
those
rich
snotty
guys
maybe
catch
an
orgy
bent
rent
went
kent
kent
that's
it
no
kent
preparatory
school
just
outside
of
town
that's
where
i've
seen
these
bracelets
pulling
up
their
school
newsletter
for
the
past
few
months
see
if
there's
anything
about
this
being
sunnydale
and
all
i
guess
we
can
rule
out
something
good
no
because
buffy
aaand
her
mother

mean
like
if
there're
others
brittany

went
to
a
party
at
the
zeta
kappa
house
well

you
gave
her
the
brushoff
and
you
never
let
her
do
anything
except
work
and
patrol
and
i
know
she's
the
chosen
one
but
you're
killing
her
with
the
pressure

i
mean
you're
gonna
live
forever
