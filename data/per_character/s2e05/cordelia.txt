dr
debi
says
when
a
man
is
speaking
you
make
serious
eye
contact
and
you
really
really
listen
and
you
laugh
at
everything
he
says
there's
really
no
comparison
between
college
men
and
high
school
boys
i
mean
look
at
that
well
not
that
it's
any
of
your
business
but
i
happen
to
be
dating
a
delta
zeta
kappa
you'll
go
to
college
someday
xander
i
just
know
your
pizza
delivery
career

the
point
here

it
the
zeta
kappas
have
to
have
a
certain
balance
at
their
party

richard
explained
it
all
to
me

busy
