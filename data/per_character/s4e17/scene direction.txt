night
a
park
like
graveyard
buffy
rolls
backward
she
is
on
her
feet
to
meet
a
snarling
bald
vampire
that
leaps
and
spins
and
kicks
at
buffy's
head
then
it
kicks
her
in
the
stomach
driving
her
back
it
snarls
and
rushes
her
and
she
punches
it
rapidly
perhaps
five
times

vampire
spins
and

down

her
and

with

from

cries
a
warning
a

vampire
a

one

at

flips
it
over

to

up
a
stake
buffy
catches
it
it
is
unclear
whether

and
anya
release
the
vampire
they
are
struggling
with
or
if
it
breaks
free
regardless
it
moves
toward
buffy
and
she
stakes
it

flinches
as

does
so

staking
