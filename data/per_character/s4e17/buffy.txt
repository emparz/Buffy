xander
anya
where's
the
other
one
a
nest
no
biggie
i
bet
i
could
do
it
i
know
could
take
at
least
two
you're
right
it's
too
many
for
just
us
you
know
who
we
need
uh
hi
we
have
a
problem
huff
thanks
for
doing
this
jonathan
ii
wouldn't
ask
but
you
got
me
it
was
very
punchy
and
they
say
no
one
eats
without
the
tv
on
anymore
well
maybe
we
could
make
it
work
for
us
we
could
stake
out
the
entrance
you
know
uh
maybe
use
a
decoy
lure
them
out
i
should
have
gotten
that
one
but
i
let
one
get
by
me
but
that's
just
it
i
don't
think
it
was
my
best
thanks
anya
that
won't
keep
me
awake
all
night
yeah
you
think
that
one
up
with
all
the
time
you
spend
not
being
able
to
bite
people
stupid
guy
you
must
be
feeling
better
are
you
i
mean
you're
not
eating
the
initiatives'
technicolor
food
of
strongness
they're
not
big
with
the
disclosure
huh
i've
felt
that
way
my
entire
life
you'd
think
i
could
do
that
guess
it
takes
different
muscles
than
demon
beheading
now
if
slaying
was
a
competitive
sport
then
i'd
have
a
chance
you
know
we
could
have
figure
staking
and
speed
staking
i
ahhh
sorry
i
this
just
isn't
my
game
i
gotta
it's
all
faith's
fault
she's
like
poison
no
worse
she's
like
acid
that
eats
through
everything
maybe
she's
a
bomb
the
point
is
everything
was
going
along
great
with
riley
and
then
she
comes
along
and
messes
everything
up
there's
no
way
he
could
know
i
mean
you
don't
just
look
at
someone
and
say
'hey
that's
not
your
body
get
out
of
that
body
with
your
hands
up'
maybe
i
have
been
blaming
him
but
how
do
i
get
past
it
hmmph
what
if
it's
too
late
what
if
after
all
this
he
doesn't
want
me
anymore
but
i'm
not
even
sure
if
i
know
how
to
talk
to
him
anymore
how
do
i
make
it
ok
again
they
get
into
a
fistfight
i've
got
a
fifty
on
anya
do
we
have
to
have
the
talk
no
talk
more
dance
i
know
i
know
all
of
that
since
you
put
your
arms
around
me
oh
what
is
it
are
you
ok
what's
going
on
why
are
you
here
jonathan
but
it
did
this
time
it
might
again
maybe
we
should
patrol
no
go
jonathan
did
he
said
it
was
some
brainless
beast
and
that
he
would
take
care
of
it
himself
i
guess
i
don't
know
he
just
he
seemed
a
little
scared
you're
right
it
was
a
great
dance
for
the
first
time
it
felt
like
faith
wasn't
there
like
no
one
was
there
but
us
what's
going
on
oh
my
god
what
happened
what
did
this
tara
what
did
this
this
was
it
this
oh
oh
i
was
kind
of
hoping
to
look
at
some
of
xander's
stuff
may
i
ask
you
something
does
it
every
seem
just
a
little
strange
that
jonathan
is
so
good
at
everything
anya
he
fights
better
than
i
do
and
i'm
the
slayer
the
slayer
that's
supposed
to
mean
something
right
actually
not
needing
validation
right
now
but
thank
you
he
just
seems
too
perfect
i
don't
know
anya
when
you
were
a
demon
you
granted
wishes
right
but
someone
could
wish
the
whole
world
to
be
different
right
that's
possible
here
i'm
just
saying
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
hhe
starred
in
the
matrix
but
he
never
left
town
and
how'd
he
graduate
from
med
school
he's
only
eighteen
years
old
this
is
the
meeting
well
i
was
just
kind
of
wondering
if
maybe
anyone
thought
that
jonathan
was
kind
of
too
perfect
but
that's
just
it
i'm
not
entirely
sure
that
we
can
trust
our
memories
anya
tell
them
about
the
alternate
universes
stop
you're
saying
it
wrong
i
think
that
jonathan
may
be
doing
something
so
that
he's
manipulating
the
world
and
we're
all
like
his
pawns
stop
with
the
shrimp
i
am
trying
to
do
something
here
i'm
not
ok
i
think
jonathan
might
be
ignoring
evidence
i
think
he
might
have
let
tara
get
hurt
no
no
the
monster
had
a
mark
on
it
jonathan
saw
it
aand
he
kind
of
blinked
he
knows
something
about
the
monster
he
was
reacting
to
the
mark
oh
wait
i
remember
something
giles
do
you
have
a
jonathan
swimsuit
calendar
no
no
whoa
no
there
i
don't
know
but
he's
definitely
keeping
jonathan
no
it's
just
the
mark
you
said
it
was
safe
and
it
wasn't
i'm
sorry
i
just
don't
understand
jonathan
let's
go
after
the
monster
right
now
you
and
me
we
can
try
shut
up
spike
you're
pretty
much
relying
on
butcher's
blood
these
days
right
spike
just
that
the
butchers
in
this
town
respect
jonathan
they
do
him
a
favor
and
you
might
find
yourself
getting
kind
of
thirsty
wow
fall
down
there
and
be
dead
for
a
while
jonathan
what
do
i
do
what
but
i
what
lose
your
i
remember
this
this
good
well
in
that
world
it
was
real
poor
xander
i
guess
jonathan
hurt
you
most
of
all
except
of
course
after
tara
yeah
why
did
you
do
it
anyway
no
i
get
why
how
jonathan
you
get
why
everyone
is
angry
though
right
it's
not
just
the
monster
people
didn't
like
being
the
little
actors
in
your
sock
puppet
theater
jonathan
you
can't
keep
trying
to
make
everything
work
out
with
some
big
gesture
all
at
once
things
are
complicated
they
take
time
and
work
watch
out
for
southpaws
yeah
i
remember
i'm
glad
we
talked
this
all
out
oh
well
whatever
we're
doing
we're
doing
it
great
mmmmm
jonathan
