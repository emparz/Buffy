um

there's
something
i
got
to
tell
you
about
showing
you
riley
in
that
place
i
didn't
mean
to

anyway
i
know
you're
feeling
all
betrayed

by
him
not
me
i
was
trying
to
help
you
know
not
like
i
made
him
be
there
after
all
actually
trying
to
help
you
best
intentions
i
mean
you
know
pretty
state
you'd
be
in
thinking
things
are
all
right
while
he's
toddling
halfway
round
the
bend
oh
i'll
insult
him
if
i
want
to
i'm
the
one
who's
on
your
side
me
doing
you
a
favor
and
you
being
dead
petty
about
it

me
getting
nothing
but
your
hatred
and
your
venom
and

you
ungrateful
bitch
bitch
buffy

there's
something
i
wanted
to
tell
you
hey
watch
it
oh
it's
you
i
was
here
first
you
know
now
why
would
i
do
that
when
it's
bugging
you
so
much
having
me
here
they
have
chicken
wings
too
also
a
sort
of
a
flowershaped
thing
they
make
from
an
onion
it's
brilliant
lovely
thought
if
i
don't
hurt
you
myself
the
chip
wouldn't
zap
me
i
could
eat
you
that
way
beat
the
onion
thing
all
to
hell
my
my
someone's
in
a
temper
this
all
sympathetic
misery
borrowed
from
the
slayer
so
she's
all
right
then
not
uh

holding
grudges
oh
yeah
okay
no
need
to
talk
about
her
then
i'm
sure
she's
merrily
slaying
some
pals
of
mine
having
a
grand
old
time
i
know
that
look
lot
of
people
never
really
got
dru
you
know
hmm
what
does
the
slayer
think
of
all
this

friction
in
the
ranks
can't
be
good
for
morale
she's
a
little

preoccupied
maybe
it's
understandable
what
with
all
the
upset
all
the
blaming
of
innocent
bystanders
who
got
caught
up
in
the
mess
i
mean
did
she
want
to
be
made
a
fool
of
and
what
does
a
person
have
to
do
to
make
it
right
hey
watch
it
mate
on
second
thought
do
what
you
like
yeah
i
could
do
that
but
i'm
paralyzed
with
not
caring
very
much
what
do
you
think
the
hospital
they've
got
this
onion
thing
hello
buffy
making
this
woman
more
comfortable
i'm
not
sampling
i'll
have
you
know
just
look
at
all
these
lovely
bloodcovered
people
i
could
but
not
a
taste
for
spike
not
a
lick
know
you
wouldn't
like
it
well
yeah
what's
it
take
