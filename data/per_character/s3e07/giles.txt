is
the
finest
occult
reference
collection
it's
on
order
oh
uh
yes
i
yes
yes
i
do
faith
if
the
council
feels
that
you
need
closer
observation
then
we
will
all
of
course
cooperate
me
oh
uh
what
do
you
propose
there
is
more
than
one
in
sunnydale
uh
twelve
within
the
city
limits
that
was
bracing
i
think
the
council
might
frown
upon
that
well
how
do
you
feel
about
a
spot
of
training
oh
this
is
intolerable
there's
not
a
word
here
about
lagos
or
the
glove
we
don't
have
time
for
this
nearmissing
just
find
out
all
you
can
about
the
demon
itsitsits
strengths
itsits
weaknesses
its
places
of
origin
and
most
importantly
what
it
plans
to
do
with
this
blasted
glove
then
go
home
but
if
you
choose
to
stay
then
work
willow
xander
you
can
stop
your
uh
studying
i've
got
what
i
need
uh
the
probable
location
of
the
glove
of
myhnegon
i
looked
uh
i'm
not
sure
yes
by
all
means
go
no
i'd
say
we're
done
ah

a
wood
engraving

the
glove
of
myhnegon
yes
ah
yes
some
tea
perhaps
mrs
post
i
can
assure
you
that
buffy
is
both
dedicated
and
industrious
and
i
am
in
complete
control
of
my
slayer
will
you
excuse
us
thank
you
that
won't
be
necessary
better
take
a
seat
buffy
we
know
angel
is
alive
xander
saw
you
with
him
it
would
appear
that
you've
been
hiding
him
and
that
you
lied
to
us
oh
don't
you
you
must've
known
it
was
wrong
seeing
angel
or
you
wouldn't
have
hidden
it
from
all
of
us
that's
enough
everybody
now
buffy
knows
our
concerns
and
her
actions
however
illadvised
can
be
understood
our
priority
right
now
is
to
retrieve
the
glove
of
myhnegon
and
try
to
destroy
it
now
all
of
you
back
to
classes
be
quiet
i
won't
remind
you
that
the
fate
of
the
world
often
lies
with
the
slayer
what
would
be
the
point
nor
shall
i
remind
you
that
you've
jeopardized
the
lives
of
all
that
you
hold
dear
by
harboring
a
known
murderer
but
sadly
i
must
remind
you
that
angel
tortured
me
for
hours
for
pleasure
you
should
have
told
me
he
was
alive
you
didn't
you
have
no
respect
for
me
or
the
job
i
perform
yes
i
do
apologize
for
bringing
you
in
at
this
late
hour
would
you
like
some
tea
she's
your
first
slayer
i
take
it
no
i'm
not
i
uh
have
the
utmost
respect
for
your
methods
in
my
own
american
way
i
also
have
the
glove
oh
not
actually
on
me
but
uh
i
believe
it's
safe
it's
in
a
mansion
on
crawford
street
aaa
friend
of
buffy's
is
keeping
it
there
or
better
still
destroy
it
yes
ii
i
didn't
think
it
could
be
done
either
but
it
involves
transforming
fire
into
living
flame
and
immolating
the
glove
iiit's
complex
but
uh
i
believe
i
have
all
the
necessary
materials
wait
buffy
you
must
must
destroy
the
glove
use
living
flame
yes
she
was
she
was
uh
kicked
out
by
the
council
a
couple
of
years
ago
for
misuses
of
dark
power
they
swear
there
was
a
memo
yes
well
we'll
have
to
see
how
that
unfolds
won't
we
