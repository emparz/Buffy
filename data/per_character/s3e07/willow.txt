oz
hey
have
a
seat
except
we
don't
have
any
seats
and
that's
very
beautiful
i
think
it's
great
when
two
people
like
two
people
and
want
to
be
close
to
them
instead
of
anyone
else
sure
hey
speaking
of
people
and
things
they
do
that
aren't
like
usual
anyone
notice
buffy
acting
sort
of
different
well
i
just
mean
you
know
she's
off
by
herself
a
lot
more
and
she's
kind
of
distracted
a
boyfriend
why
wouldn't
she
tell
us
about
your
new
boyfriend
who
we
made
up
unless
we
didn't
really
who
ugh
it's
late
i'm
tired
what
does
he
want
from
us
anyway
my
eyes
are
all
blurry
ohh
oh
stop
yeah
well
that's
great
giles
um
how'd
you
find
it
aand
i'll
just
keep
studying
i
think
we're
on
the
verge
of
a
big
lagos
breakthrough
nobody's
here
to
blame
you
buffy
but
this
is
serious
you
need
help
this
isn't
about
attacking
buffy
remember
'i'
statements
only
'i
feel
angry'
'i
feel
worried'
cordelia
fine
here's
one
i
feel
worried
about
me
last
time
around
angel
barely
laid
a
hand
on
buffy
he
was
way
more
interested
in
killing
her
friends
buffy
i
feel
that
when
it
comes
to
angel
you
can't
see
straight
and
that's
why
we're
we're
all
gonna
help
you
face
this
giles
no
one's
doing
the
'i'
statements
hey
zero
you
were
scared
you
kept
a
secret
you
know
that'sitit's
okay
i
mean
secrets
aren't
bad
you
know
they're
normal
they're
better
than
normal
they're
good
secrets
are
good
must
be
a
reason
why
we
keep
them
right
so
are
you
going
to
the
bronze
tonight
or
uh
are
you
gonna
sneak
away
for
a
notsosecret
rendezvous
with
angel
well
angel
has
the
glove
now
right
ah
but
instead
he
finds
a
buffy
in
a
notsogood
mood
um
not
to
downplay
my
own
slaying
abilities
which
in
some
circles
are
considered
formidable
but
shouldn't
faith
be
here
that's
true
the
emotional
marathon
man
well
sure
you
do
this
big
burden's
been
lifted
i
mean
keeping
secrets
is
a
lot
of
work
one
could
hypothetically
imagine
none
whatsoever
but
can
i
ask
you
a
question
when
you
were
with
angel
and
nobody
knew
about
it
did
that
make
it
feel
you
know
sexier
somehow
oh
nothing
i'm
just
wondering
gotta
keep
asking
the
big
old
questions
when
you're
blessed
with
this
girl's
thirst
for
knowledge
and
okay
there's
something
i
have
to
tell
you
okay
this
will
make
me
feel
better
right
you
know
i
always
consider
myself
a
good
person
floss
do
my
homework
never
cheat
but
lately
and
please
don't
judge
me
on
this
but
i
want
you
to
be
the
first
to
know
that
that
there's
a
demon
behind
you
don't
yes
oh
i
i
opened
my
sat
test
booklet
five
minutes
early
just
doesn't
seem
important
now
does
it
shut
up
and
help
me
well
it's
either
the
catalyst
for
living
flame
or
just
some
really
smelly
sand
we'll
have
to
test
this
what
there's
no
time
to
test
this
what
do
you
think
buffy
and
angel
are
gonna
do
well
he
saved
me
from
a
horrible
flamey
death
that
sort
of
makes
me
like
him
again
the
whole
angel
thing
is
so
weird
