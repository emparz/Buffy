if
i
could
walk
out
oz
looks
out
into
the
crowd
a
smile
for
willow
on
his
face
she
is
sitting
at
a
table
with
xander
and
cordelia
they
have
to
share
it
with
some
other
people
it's
so
crowded
you
know
i'd
never
lie
the
song
ends
with
oz's
last
chord
understated
and
fading
the
crowd
begins
to
applaud
and
cheer
as
devon
takes
his
bows
oz
lifts
his
guitar
from
his
shoulder
leans
the
instrument
against
the
back
wall
of
the
stage
and
heads
down
the
stairs
at
the
side
of
the
stage
to
join
the
gang
at
their
table
