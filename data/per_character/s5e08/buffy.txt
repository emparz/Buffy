i
don't
know
it's
some

xray
i
guess
dawn
i'm
really
riley
i
do
i
do
i'm
glad
i
just
ii
didn't

i
mean
until
we
knew
what
it
was
well
she
just
had
a
cat
scan
i
was
about
to
go
in
and
find
out
will
you

sit
with
dawn
while
i
talk
to
mom
she's
in
the
waiting
room
hi
may
i
come
in
uh
she's
with
riley
they're
watching
tv
in
the
waiting
room
the
or
mom
what
did
they
find
right
no
concern
do
we
have
the
results
yet
no
excuse
me
no
i

i
don't
mean
to
be
rude
i
just
i've
been
sitting
for
hours
i
don't
wanna
sit
i
just

tell
me
please
things
what
things
but
what
can
we
do
is
there
something
that
i

i
mean

can
i
help
what's
a
real
chance
i'm
not
sure
uh
i
think
so
uh
yeah
she
um
sheshe
has
one
of
those
ear
things
uh

ii
don't
know
maybe
i'm
sorry
uh
it's
okay
you
mean

they
they
didn't
need
him
thank
you
it's
ben
right
he
um
he
was
just
telling
me
that
there's
nothing
i
can
do
a
break
it's
bad
i

i
have
to
do
something
yeah
like
you
know
magic
like
a
healing
spell
i
need
to
talk
to
giles
uh
will
you
do
me
a
favor
and
and
drop
dawn
off
at
school
and
tell
her

meet
her
at
the
magic
shop
in
an
hour
when
she
gets
off
tell
her

i
figured
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
mystical
cure
right
i
mean
like
a
a
potion
or
a
spell
or
something
we

what
happened
my
god

no
one
got
hurt
right
okay
so
that's
good

how
did
she
get
away
with
this
bad
mojo
stuff
sobek
okay
so
she's
making
a
monster
what
for
what
does
it
do

you
keep
working
on
it
i'll
go
kill
it
