think
so
oh
i'm
almost
certain
you're
not
but
to
be
fair
i
wasn't
listening
not
as
such
hmm
uh
rather
reckless
of
him
all
that
aside
i
should
think
you'd
be
pleased
to
avoid
the
confrontation
yes
well
um
in
any
event
uh
since
you're
all
here
tara
and
i
could
use
your
help
researching
buffy's
mysterious
woman
ah
weeping
buddha
shoulders
your
spiritual
burden
makes
a
lovely
paperweight
too
thank
you
come
again
something
new
you
mean
that
which
cannot
be
named
predates
language
itself
if
tara's
right
then
we're
blind
there's

there's
no
way
we
can
determine

her
moves
her
habits
where
she'll
turn
up
next
he
turns
around
putting
his
glasses
back
on
and
is
confronted
by
glory
she
has
a
few
items
in
her
hands
oh
i
beg
your
glory
uhhuh
i
want
these
yes
of
course
um
you
find
everything
all
right
that's
um
your
receipt
and

thank
you
she
could
be
anywhere
but
if
she
is
as
powerful
as
uh
buffy
says
i
imagine
it
won't
be
long
before
she
makes
herself
known
anya
your
heys
are
startling
the
customers
yes
i
believe
i
did
allow
me
to
answer
that
question
with
a
firing
be
that
as
it
may
i
still
see
no
reason
for
concern
i
mean
thethe
sobekian
transmogrification
spells
were
lost
thousands
of
years
ago
and
besides
the
young
woman
to
whom
i
sold
them
would
have
to
have
had
enormous
power
oh
dear
lord
the
truth
is
uh
the

mystical
and
the
medical
aren't
meant
to
mix
buffy
sorry
um

the
human
mind
is
very
delicate
too
much
can
go
wrong
nothing
to
concern
you
uh
buffy
giles
the
uh
demon
woman
was
here
the
one
who
attacked
you
oh
no
thankfully
no
uh
no
violence
to
speak
of
i
i
i
i
didn't
know
it
was
her
i
mean
how
could
i
if
it's
any
consolation
i
may
have
overcharged
her
we've
managed
to
decipher
the
markings
that
were
on
the
bloodstone
that
i
sold

that
she
left
with
um
cobra
she's
going
to
transmogrify
a
cobra
that's
the
part

we're
working
on
it
buffy
aleister
crowley
sings
um
sadly
no
ii
don't
carry
that
but
i
do
have
some
very
nice
whale
sounds
oh
excuse
me
for
a
moment
um
sheshe
left
a
while
ago
uh
let
isn't
really
a
factor
when
she
sets
her
mind
to
something
you
know
that
magic
box
your
onestop
spot
to
shop
for
buffy
giles
it's
me
buffy
you
all
right
where
are
you
are
you
badly
hurt
i'll
i'll
come
right
over
do
you
know
why
she
raised
it
i'll
warn
the
others
we'll
get
weapons
we'll
fan
out
buffy
wait
what
time
is
it
half
past
four
why
yes
we'll
not
say
a
word
she's
in
good
hands
buffy
there's
really
nothing
else
you
can
do
bye
none
glory
