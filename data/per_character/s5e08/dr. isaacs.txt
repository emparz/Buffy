excuse
me
i'm
just
gonna
check
on
the
status
of
the
or
everything
went
fine
they're
moving
her
into
recovery
now
let's
um
sit
down
over
here
for
a
minute
your
mother
has

the
term
is
lowgrade
glioma
it's
a
brain
tumor
the
clinical
name
is
oligodendroglioma
it's
in
the
left
hemisphere
of
the
cerebrum
in
your
mother's
case
the
tumor
seems
to
have
started
there
in
other
words
it
hasn't
spread
from
another
part
of
the
body
i
know
this
is
very
difficult
and
uh
because
of
the
nature
of
your
mother's
illness

unfortunately
things
may
progress
very
quickly
symptoms
there's
a
fair
variety
that
might
present
loss
of
vision
or
appetite
lack
of
muscle
control
uh
mood
swings
well
not
much
until
we
determine
if
the
tumor's
operable
which
we
are
working
on
well
there's
some
literature
you
might
want
to
look
at
if
we
aren't
able
to
go
in
surgically
there
are
a
number
of
new
treatments
that
are
very
promising
your
mother's
prognosis
is
a
lot
better
today
than
it
would
have
been
only
a
year
ago
even
if
the
tumor's
not
operable
she
has
a
real
chance
nearly
one
out
of
three
patients
with
this
condition
does
just
fine
now
let
me
ask
does
your
mother's
insurance
company
require
copies
of
the
mri
and
pathology
reports
well
just
let
me
know
as
soon
as
possible
and
i
could
use
some
information
regarding
your
mom's
lifestyle
and
home
environment
for
instance
does
she
use
a
cell
phone
ok
is
your
house
near
any
power
lines
chemical
plants
waste
disposal
facilities
well
the
more
we
know
excuse
me
miss
summers
