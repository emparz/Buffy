no
vampires
transporting
boxes
if
the
bus
depot
is
as
empty
as
the
docks
and
the
airport
yes
cordelia
has
a
point
now
iiif
buffy
and
angel
were
were
harmed
then
we
don't
stand
to
fare
much
better
well
ii
would
have
no
the
judge
iis
he
oh
damn
it
why
didn't
you
call
we
we
we
thought

judge
we
we
must
stop
him
what
can
you
tell
us
in
time
he
won't
need
to
the
stronger
he
gets
he'll
be
able
to
reduce
us
to
charcoal
with
a
look
i
better
continue
researching
must
look
for
a
weak
spot
the
rest
of
you
should
get
to
your
classes
thank
you
but
he
does
do
that
on
occasion
no
is
she
gonna
join
us
here
and
we're
absolutely
certain
that
that
angel
has
reverted
to
his
former
self
i'm
leaning
towards
blind
panic
myself
i'm
sorry
it's
just
that
things
are
bad
enough
with
the
judge
here
angel
crossing
over
to
the
other
side
iii
wasn't
prepared
for
that
what
things
if
only
we
knew
how
it
happened
well
something
set
it
off
some
some
uh
event
must've
triggered
his
transformation
well
if
anyone
would
know
buffy
itit
should
be
you
well
did
anything
happen
last
night
that
that
might
buffy
i'm
sorry
but
we
can't
afford
to
buffy
i'm
not
sure
what
we
should
do
about
buffy
iii
can
imagine
what
she's
going
through
oh
buffy
buffy

iii'll
deal
with
this
yyyou're
you're
all
dismissed
for
god's
sake

can't
go
around
accusing
everybody
jenny
i
don't
understand
wwwhhhow
do
you
know
you
were
responsible
ffor
oh
he's
doing
this
deliberately
buffy

trying
to
make
it
harder
for
you
what
agreed
she
just
said
get
out
we
haven't
a
bead
on
where
they
would
go
it's
not
over
iii
suppose
you
know
that
he'll
come
after
you
particularly
his
profile
uh
well
he
he's
likely
to
strike
out
at
the
things
that
made
him
the
most
human
no
no
no
i'm
not
no
i
don't
believe
it
is
do
you
want
me
to
wag
my
finger
at
you
and
tell
you
that
you
acted
rashly
you
did
aand
i
can
i
know
that
you
loved
him
and
he
has
proven
more
than
once
that
he
loved
you
you
couldn't
have
known
what
would
happen
the
coming
months
aare
gonna
are
gonna
be
hard
