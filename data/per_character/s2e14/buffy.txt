it
easier

on
the
offensive
we
need
to
figure
out
where
they'd
go

do
i
knew
it

take
out
any
lesser
vamps

this
is
now
best
present
ever
we
can't
be
sure
pick
up
the
pieces
and
keep
them
separate
that
doesn't
work
anymore
you're
not
angel
give
me
time
you
must
be
so
disappointed
in
me
but
this
is
all
my
fault

some
singing

some
running
around

just
let
it
burn
