freeze
put
your
hands
up
back
away
from

it
now

do
well
to
keep
your
mouth
shut
missy
but
i
didn't
do
anything
why
do
i
find
that
so
very
hard
to
believe
in
there
you
know
this
girl
buffy
summers
if
there's
trouble
she's
behind
it
you
stupid
little
troll
you
have
no
idea
attitude
problem
serious
look
i
just
wanna
know
if
my
friends
are
okay
all
right
that's
enough
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent
anything
you
say
can
and
stop
get
down
all
units
we
have
a
fugitive
on
foot
at
the
high
school
xander
ohhh
i
was
so
worried
i
didn't
know
if
you
were
okay
the
cops
were
yeah
i
i
heard
them
chase
you
out
i
was
just
coming
out
of
it
souvenir
well
what
about
the
others
are
they
okay
okay
that
was
about
equal
parts
protecting
me
and
copping
a
feel
right
what
is
it
the
doctor
said
it
was
head
trauma
she
can
wake
up
at
any
time
but
um
the
longer
it
lasts
the
less
likely
it
is
i
never
should've
let
her
try
to
do
that
curse
angel
must've
known
where
are
her
parents
with
relatives
in
phoenix
i
gave
them
a
call
they're
does
oz
know
oh
man
um
i
didn't
even
think
hey
hey
how
is
she
the
doctor
told
me
that
yeah
we're
uh
still
waiting
you
okay
i
ran
i
think
i
made
it
through
three
counties
before
i
realized
nobody
was
chasing
me
not
too
brave
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
did
giles
keep
up
with
you
i
didn't
see
giles
you
mean
he's
not
in
the
hospital
no
mm
ohhh
hi
rupert
i
wasn't
sure
you
were
gonna
wake
up
you
had
me
worried
what
do
you
want
i
wanna
torture
you
i
used
to
love
it
and
it's
been
a
long
time
i
mean
the
last
time
i
tortured
somebody
they
didn't
even
have
oh
yeah
acathla
he's
an
even
harder
guy
to
wake
up
than
you
are
i
mean
i
performed
the
rituals
said
all
the
right
phrases
blood
on
my
hand
got
nothing
big
doughnut
hole
for
my
troubles
i
figure
you
know
the
ritual
you're
pretty
up
on
these
things
you
could
probably
tell
me
what
i'm
doing
wrong
but
honestly
i
sorta
hope
you
don't
'cause
i
really
wanna
torture
you
no
iiit's
impossible
there
there's
been
some
terrible
mistake
and
you
have
no
idea
where
your
daughter
is
she
said
she
was
going
to
her
friend
willow's
house
maybe
she
slept
over
is
that
willow
rosenberg
yes
second
victim
what
your
daughter
has
a
history
of
violence
doesn't
she
ms
well
you
call
us
okay
if
she
decides
to
stop
by
be
best
if
she
just
comes
in
giles
giles
i
don't
think
he's
here
who
are
you
whistler
what
are
you
doing
here
i'm
waiting
for
you
why
'cause
iii
need
a
date
to
the
prom
i
have
had
a
really
bad
day
okay
if
you

worth
hearing
then
i
am
grateful

gonna
crack
jokes
then
i'm
gonna
pull
out
your
ribcage
and
wear
it

creep
again
now
what

have
anything
useful

you've
seen
it
before
you
know
what
it

didn't
i
go
with
cordy
to
the

my
things

fill
you
in
sure
i'll
drive

i
resolve
face
be
careful

i
can
stop
the
pain
you've
been
very
brave
but
it's
over
you've
given
enough
now
let
me
make
it
stop
please
just
tell
me
what
i
need

cut
him
up
you'll
never
get
your
answers
since
when
did
you
become
so
levelheaded
right
about
the
time
you
became
so
pigheaded
you
have
your
way
with
him
you'll
never
get
to
destroy
the
world

much
of
a
liability

months

so
muddled
i
oh
oh
buffy
what's
happening
shh
don't
worry
about
it
i
love
you
i
love
you
close
your
eyes
buffy
the
winter
here
is
cold
and
bitter
it's
chilled
us
to
the
bone
we
haven't
seen
the
sun
for
weeks
too
long
too
far
from
home
she
looks
at
the
neighboring
houses
then
back
at
hers
cut
into
the
house
joyce
climbs
the
steps
and
looks
down
the
hall
at
buffy's
door
i
feel
just
like
i'm
sinking
joyce
buffy
and
i
claw
for
solid
ground
she
walks
to
buffy's
room
and
looks
in
the
windows
are
open
and
some
of
her
daughter's
things
are
strewn
on
the
bed
she
steps
in
and
looks
around
i'm
pulled
down
by
the
undertow
she
sees
a
note
on
the
bed
among
a
bunch
of
clothes
i
never
thought
i
could
feel
so
low
she
picks
up
the
note
and
reads
and
oh
darkness
i
feel
like
letting
go
she
begins
to
cry
as
she
reads
and
sits
down
on
the
bed
if
all
of
the
strength
and
all
of
the
courage
come
and
lift
me
from
this
place
cut
to
sunnydale
high
school
xander
and
giles
walk
up
to
oz
pushing
willow
in
a
wheelchair
with
cordelia
at
their
side
giles'
walk
is
a
bit
unsteady
i
know
i
can
love
you
much
better
than
this
full
of
grace
giles
willow
are
you
sure
you
should
be
out
of
bed
look
who's
talking
yes
any
word
you
guys
haven't
seen
her
either
no
but
we
know
the
world
didn't
end
'cause
check
it
out
well
we
uh
we
went
back
to
the
mansion
iit
was
empty
um
and
acathla
was
was
dormant
i
think
the
spell
worked
i
felt
something
go
through
me
plus
the
orb
did
that
cool
glow
thing
well
maybe
it
wasn't
in
time
maybe
she
had
to
kill
him
before
the
cure
could
work
well
then
she'd
wanna
be
alone
i
guess
or
maybe
angel
was
saved
and
they
want
to
be
alone
together
perhaps
well
she's
gotta
show
up
sooner
or
later
we
still
have
school
yeah
she'll
be
here
in
a
while
where
everything
we
said
and
did
hurts
us
all
the
more
they
all
turn
and
head
into
the
school
it's
just
that
we
stayed
too
long
in
the
same
old
sickly
skin
cut
to
buffy
looking
at
the
school
from
behind
a
tree
she
watches
them
as
they
go
in
i'm
pulled
down
by
the
undertow
i
never
thought
i
could
feel
so
low
the
camera
pans
around
her
to
her
face
looking
sadly
at
the
school
a
light
breeze
sweeps
her
hair
back
and
oh
darkness
i
feel
like
letting
go
she
turns
around
and
walks
away
down
the
street
without
looking
back
if
all
of
the
strength
and
all
of
the
courage
come
and
lift
me
from
this
place
dissolve
to
the
inside
of
a
bus
buffy's
reflection
is
visible
in
the
window
as
it
drives
by
her
house
i
know
i
can
love
you
much
better
than
this
full
of
grace
buffy
looks
out
the
window
calmly
as
the
bus
drives
on
i
know
i
can
love
you
much
better
than
this
the
camera
pans
down
to
a
sign
that
reads
now
leaving
sunnydale
come
back
soon
it's
better
this
