'want'
isn't
always
the
right
thing
to
do
to

on
want

to
not
act
on
want
what

again
carpe
diem
you
told

day'
not
carp
carpe

day'
right
i
i
think
we're

certain
point
then
seizing
is
sort
of
inevitable
wow

potential
there's
oz
over
there
what
are
we
thinking
any
sparkage
he's
nice
hey
i
like
his
hands
mm
a
fixation
on
insignificant
detail
is
a
definite
crush
sign
oh
i
don't
know
though
i
mean
he
is
a
senior
you
think
he's
too
old
'cause
he's
a
senior

my
boyfriend

a
bicentennial

the
rest
of
your
life
waiting
for
xander
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
hottie

a
move
do
the
talking
thing

what
if

the
awkwardsilence
thing

until
you
try
hey
hey

yeah
it
helps
itit
creates
a
comfort
zone
do
you
wanna
go
out
with
me
tomorrow
night
oh
i
can't
well
see
i
like
that
you're
unpredictable
oh
it's
just
it's
buffy's
birthday
and
we're
throwing
her
a
surprise
party
it's
okay
but
you
could
come
if
you
want
to
well
i
don't
wanna
crash
no
it's
fine
well
you
could
be
m
my
date
all
right
i'm
in
i
said
'date'
so
buffy's
party
manana
well
just
because
she's
miss
savetheworld
and
everything
you
have
to
make
a
big
deal
i
have
to
cook
and
everything
you're
cooking
well
i'm
chips
and
dips
girl
horrors
all
that
opening
and
stirring
and
shopping
and
carrying
well
then
you
should
have
a
person
who
does
such
things
for
you
well
that's
what
i've
been
saying
to
my
father
but
does
he
listen
um
so
uh
you're
going
and
and
and
i'm
going
should
we
maybe
go
why
i
dunno
this
thing
with
us
despite
our
better
judgment
it
keeps
happening
maybe
we
should
just
admit
that
we're
dating
groping
in
a
broom
closet
isn't
dating
you
don't
call
it
a
date
until
the
guy
spends
money
fine
i'll
spend
then
we'll
grope
whatever
i
just
think
it's
some
kind
of
whacked
that
we
feel
we
have
to
hide
it
from
all
our
friends
well
of
course
you
wanna
tell
everybody
you
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
i
on
the
other
hand
have
everything
to
be
ashamed
of
you
know
what
'nuff
said
forget
it
it
must've
been
my
multiplepersonality
guy
talking
i
call
him
idiot
jed
glutton
for
punishment
oh
good
morning
is
everything
in
order
for
the
party
absolutely
you
ready
to
get
down
you
funky
party
weasel
here
comes
buffy
now
remember
discretion
is
the
better
part
of
valor
you
coulda
just
said
'shh'
god
are
all
you
brits
such
drama
queens
buffy
i
feel
a
prebirthday
spanking
coming
on
i'd
curb
that
impulse
if
i
were
you
xander
check
cancel
spanking
you
alright
buffy
you
seem
a
little
fatigued
rough
night
i
had
a
dream
that
drusilla
was
alive
and
she
killed
angel
iit
just
really
freaked
me
out
you
fear
it
was
more
of
a
a
a
portent
see
i
don't
know
i
don't
wanna
start
a
big
freakout
over
nothing
still
best
to
be
uh
on
the
alert
if
drusilla
is
alive
ii
it
could
be
a
fairly
cataclysmic
state
of
affairs
again
so
many
words
couldn't
you
just
say
'we'd
be
in
trouble'
go
to
class
xander
gone
notice
the
economy
of
phrasing
'gone'
simple
direct
maybe
i
should
get
'gone'
too
uh
don't
worry
unduly
buffy
iii'm
sure
it's
nothing
i
know
i
should
keep
my
slayer
cool
but
it's
angel
which
automatically
equals
maxiwig
hmm
i
have
your
package
just
put
it
on
the
table
near
the
other
gifts
are
you
dead
set
on
this
pet
wouldn't
you
rather
have
your
party
in
vienna
but
the
invitations
are
sent
yeah
it's
just
i've
had
it
with
this
place
nothing
ever
comes
off
like
it's
supposed
to
my
gatherings
are
always
perfect
remember
spain
hey
the
bulls
i
remember
sweet
but
sunnydale's
cursed
for
us
angel
and
the
slayer
see
to
that
shhh
i've
got
good
games
for
everyone
you'll
see
these
flowers
are
wrong
i
can't
abide
them
let's
try
something
different
with
the
flowers
then
can
i
open
one
can
i
can
i
ooo
just
a
peek
love
they're
for
the
party
do
you
like
it
baby
it
reeks
of
death
this
will
be
the
best
party
ever
why
is
that
because
it
will
be
the
last
mall
trip
for
your
birthday
on
saturday
don't
forget
space
on
a
momsponsored
shopping
opportunity
not
likely
hmm
so
does
um
17
feel
any
different
than
16
it's
funny
you
should
ask
that
you
know
i
woke
up
feeling
more
responsible
mature
and
levelheaded
really
tch
it's
uncanny
i
now
possess
the
qualities
one
looks
for
in
a
licensed
driver
buffy
you
said
we
could
talk
about
it
again
when
i
was
17
do
you
really
think
you're
ready
buffy
jenny
calendar
you
startled
me
you
look
well
yes
i'm
fine
i
know
i
haven't
written
as
much
lately
i've
been
busy
i
cannot
imagine
what
is
so
important
to
make
you
ignore
the
responsibility
to
your
people
well
i've
been
working
and
the
elder
woman
has
been
reading
signs
something
is
different
nothing
has
changed
the
curse
still
holds
the
elder
woman
is
never
wrong
she
says
his
pain
is
lessening
she
can
feel
it
there
is
there
is
what
a
girl
what
how
could
you
let
this
happen
i
promise
you
angel
still
suffers
and
he
makes
amends
for
his
evil
he
even
saved
my
life
so
you
just
forget
that
he
destroyed
the
most
beloved
daughter
of
your
tribe
that
he
killed
every
man
woman
and
child
that
touched
her
life
vengeance
demands
that
his
pain
be
eternal
as
ours
is
if
this
this
girl
gives
him
one
minute
of
happiness
it
is
one
minute
too
much
i'm
sorry
i
thought
you
thought
what
you
thought
you
are
jenny
calendar
now
you
are
still
janna
of
the
kalderash
people
a
gypsy
i
know
uncle
i
know
then
prove
it
your
time
for
watching
is
past
the
girl
and
him
it
ends
now
do
what
you
must
to
take
her
from
him
i
will
see
to
it
and
then
my
mom
broke
the
plate
it
was
just
like
my
dream
every
gesture
every
word
it
was
so
creepy
yes
well
iii'd
imagine
it
would
be
fairly
unnerving
hey
it's
the
woman
of
the
hour
it's
happy
birthday
buffy
not
happy
birthday
buffy
iit's
just
that
um
part
of
the
nightmare
that
buffy
had
the
other
night
actually
transpired
which
means
drusilla
might
still
be
alive
giles
in
my
dream
i
couldn't
stop
her
she
blindsided
me
aangel
was
gone
before
i
knew
what
happened
even
if
she
is
alive
uh
we
can
still
protect
angel
dreams
aren't
prophecies
buffy
yyyyou
dreamt
that
the
master
had
risen
but
you
stopped
it
from
happening
you
ground
his
bones
to
make
your
bread
that's
true
except
for
the
bread
part
okay
so
fine
we're
one
step
ahead
but
i
wanna
stay
that
way
absolutely
let
me
read
up
on
drusilla
uh
see
if
she
has
any
particular
patterns
why
don't
you
meet
me
here
at
700
we'll
map
out
a
strategy
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
until
then
go
to
classes
do
your
homework
have
supper
right
be
that
buffy
well
that's
not
a
perky
birthday
puppy
so
much
for
our
surprise
party
i
bought
little
hats
and
everything
mmhm
oh
well
i
guess
i'll
tell
cordelia
no
you
won't
we're
having
a
party
tonight
looks
like
mr
caution
man
but
the
sound
he
makes
is
funny
buffy's
surprise
party
will
go
ahead
as
we
planned
except
i
won't
be
wearing
the
little
hat
but
buffy
and
angel
may
well
be
in
danger
as
they
have
been
before
and
i
imagine
will
be
again
one
thing
i've
learned
in
my
tenure
here
on
the
hellmouth
is
that
there
is
no
good
time
to
relax
and
buffy's
turning
17
just
this
once
and
she
deserves
a
party
you're
a
great
man
of
our
time
and
anyway
angel's
coming
so
she'll
be
able
to
protect
him
and
have
cake
precisely
buffy
oh
my
god
i
didn't
see
you
there
sorry
um
giles
wanted
me
to
tell
you
that
there's
been
a
change
of
plans
uh
he
wants
to
meet
you
someplace
near
his
house
'cause
he
had
to
run
home
and
get
a
book
or
something
'cause
heaven
knows
there
aren't
enough
books
in
the
library
uh
he's
very
thorough
oh
which
is
not
to
bag
it's
kind
of
manly
in
an
obsessivecompulsive
kind
of
way
don't
you
think
mmhm
um
you
know
my
car's
here
why
don't
i
drive
you
okay
are
we
goin'
to
the
bronze
i'm
not
sure
giles
gave
me
an
address
i'm
just
following
his
directions
this
looks
funky
stop
for
a
sec
no
buffy
maybe
you
shouldn't
sorry
sacred
duty
yada
yada
yada
what
is
this
every
time
i
see
you
you're
stealing
something
you
really
should
speak
with
someone
about
this
klepto
issue
where
is
she
shhh
i
think
i
hear
her
coming
surprise
that
pretty
much
sums
it
up
tch
buffy
are
you
okay
yes
wwhat
happened
uh
there
were
these
vamps
outs
wwhat's
going
on
oh
um
a
surprise
party
happy
birthday
you
guys
did
all
this
for
me
that
is
so
sweet
you
sure
you're
okay
yes
i'm
fine
are
you
okay
yeah
hey
did
everybody
see
that
guy
just
turn
to
dust
uh
well
uh
sort
of
yep
vampires
are
real
a
lot
of
them
live
in
sunnydale
willow
will
fill
you
in
i
know
it's
hard
to
accept
at
first
actually
it
explains
a
lot
hey
can
somebody
give
me
a
hand
here
those
creeps
left
this
behind
what
is
it
i
have
no
idea
can
can
it
be
opened
yeah
this
looks
like
a
release
right
here
well
clearly
the
hellmouth's
answer
to
'what
do
you
get
the
slayer
who
has
everything'
giles
good
heavens
buffy
are
you
all
right
man
that
thing
had
major
grip
wwhat
was
that
it
looked
like
an
arm
it
can't
be
she
wouldn't
what
uh
vamp's
version
of
'snakes
in
a
can'
or
do
you
care
to
share
angel
itit's
a
legend
way
before
my
time
of
a
demon
brought
forth
to
rid
the
earth
of
the
plague
of
humanity
separate
the
righteous
from
the
wicked
and
to
burn
the
righteous
down
they
call
him
the
judge
the
judge
this
is
he
not
all
of
him
um
still
needing
backstory
here
um
he
he
he
couldn't
be
killed
yes
um
aan
army
was
sent
against
him
most
of
them
died
but
uh
finally
they
were
able
to
dismember
him
but
uh
not
kill
him
the
pieces
were
scattered
buried
in
every
corner
of
the
earth
so
all
these
parts
are
being
brought
here
by
drusilla
the
vamps
outside
were
spike's
men
she's
just
crazy
enough
to
do
it
do
what
reassemble
the
judge
and
bring
forth
armageddon
is
anybody
else
gonna
have
cake
we
need
to
get
this
out
of
town
angel
what
you
have
to
do
it
you're
the
only
one
that
can
protect
this
thing
what
about
me
what
you're
just
gonna
skip
town
for
a
few
months
'months'
she's
right
i
gotta
get
this
to
the
remotest
region
possible
but
that's
not
months
i
gotta
catch
a
cargo
ship
to
asia
maybe
trek
to
nepal
you
know
those
newfangled
flying
machines
really
are
much
safer
than
they
used
to
be
i
can't
fly
there's
no
sure
way
to
guard
against
the
daylight
iii
don't
like
this
any
more
than
you
do
buffy
but
there's
no
other
choice
when
tonight
as
soon
as
possible
but
it's
my
birthday
i'll
drive
you
to
the
docks
you
lost
it
you
lost
my
present
i
know
i'm
sorry
it
was
a
bad
turn
man
she
can't
have
her
fun
without
the
box
the
slayer
she
came
out
of
nowhere
i
didn't
even
see
her
make
a
wish
what
i'm
going
to
blow
out
the
candles
you
might
give
him
a
chance
to
find
your
lost
treasure
he
is
a
wanker
but
he's
the
only
one
we've
got
with
half
a
brain
if
he
fails
you
can
eat
his
eyes
out
of
the
sockets
for
all
i
care
i'll
get
it
please
i
swear
okay
hurry
back
then
i
should
go
the
rest
of
the
way
alone
okay
but
i'll
be
back
i
will
when
six
months
a
year
you
don't
know
how
long
it's
gonna
take
or
if
we'll
even
hey
if
we'll
even
what
well
if
you
haven't
noticed
someone
pretty
much
always
wants
us
dead
don't
say
that
we'll
be
fine
we
don't
know
that
we
can't
know
buffy
nobody
can
that's
just
the
deal
i
have
something
for
you
for
your
birthday
i
i
was
gonna
give
it
to
you
earlier
but
it's
beautiful
my
people
before
i
was
changed
they
exchanged
this
as
a
sign
of
devotion
it's
a
claddagh
ring
the
hands
represent
friendship
the
crown
represents
loyalty
and
the
heart
well
you
know
wear
it
with
the
heart
pointing
towards
you
it
means
you
belong
to
somebody
like
this
put
it
on
i
don't
wanna
do
this
me
either
so
don't
go
buffy
i
angel
the
box
buffy
they
should
be
back
by
now
maybe
buffy
needed
a
few
minutes
to
pull
herself
together
poor
buffy
on
her
birthday
and
everything
hmm
it's
sad
granted
but
let's
look
at
the
upside
for
a
moment
i
mean
what
kind
of
a
future
would
she've
really
had
with
him
she's
got
2
jobs
denny's
waitress
by
day
slayer
by
night
and
angel's
always
in
front
of
the
tv
with
a
big
blood
belly
and
he's
dreamin'
of
the
glory
days
when
buffy
still
thought
this
whole
creature
of
the
night
routine
was
a
big
turn
on
you've
thought
way
too
much
about
this
no
no
that's
just
the
beginning
have
i
told
you
the
part
where
i
fly
into
town
in
my
private
jet
and
take
buffy
out
for
prime
rib
xander
and
she
cries
what
happened
dru's
guys
ambushed
us
they
got
the
box
where's
jenny
uh
she
took
angel
to
get
clothing
i
i
had
some
here
and
we
needed
clothes
because
we
got
wet
giles
what
do
we
know
the
more
i
study
the
judge
the
less
i
like
him
his
touch
can
literally
burn
the
humanity
out
of
you
a
true
creature
of
evil
can
survive
the
process
no
human
ever
has
what's
the
problem
we
send
cordy
to
fight
this
guy
and
we
go
for
pizza
can
this
guy
be
stopped
without
an
army
um
'no
weapon
forged
can
kill
him'
not
very
encouraging
if
we
could
only
stop
them
from
assembling
him
we
need
to
find
his
weak
spots
and
we
need
to
figure
out
where
they'd
be
keeping
him
this
could
take
time
better
do
a
roundrobin
xander
you
go
first
good
call
round
robin
it's
when
everybody
calls
everybody
else's
mom
and
tells
them
they're
staying
at
everyone's
house
thus
freeing
us
up
for
world
saveage
and
allnight
keggers
what
only
xander
gets
to
make
dumb
jokes
mom
hi
xander
yeah
uh
willow
and
i
are
gonna
be
studying
all
night
long
so
i'm
not
gonna
be
coming

can't
get
over

some
rest

how

now
to
the
place
where
all
the
concubines
meet
and
converse
with
them
marvel
at
their
pale
skin
wonder
how
they
chew
on
their
pointy
teeth
and
hair
are
beauty
they
know
it's
their
duty
to
be
countess
in
their
hearts

their
look

i
have
for
you
ducks
minds

into
their
eyes

transylvanian
concubine
