obscurate
nos
non
diutius
do
not
conceal
any
longer
now
i
think
that
was
the
last
willow
you
okay
yeah
i'm
fine
ththe
shaking
is
is
a
side
effect
of
the
fear
thank
you
well
if
it
wasn't
for
that
clouding
spell
yeah
it
went
good
nothing
melted
like
last
time
these
babes
were
wicked
rowdy
what's
their
deal
i
wish
i
knew
most
of
my
sources
have
dried
up
since
the
uh
council
has
relieved
me
of
my
duties
i
was
aware
there
was
a
nest
here
but
quite
frankly
i
expected
it
to
be
vampires
these
these
are
new
and
improved
yes
i'm
sorry
i
should've
had
you
better
prepared
and
i
should
never
have
allowed
willow
and
uh
and
uh
i'm
good
we're
fine
just
a
little
bit
dirty
good
show
everyone
just
great
i
think
we
have
a
hit
are
you
okay
tiptop
really
if
anyone
sees
my
spine
laying
around
just
try
not
to
step
on
it
xander
one
of
these
days
you're
gonna
get
yourself
hurt
or
killed
or
both
aand
you
know
with
the
pain
and
the
death
maybe
you
shouldn't
be
leaping
into
the
fray
like
that
mmaybe
you
should
be
excuse
me
who
at
a
crucial
moment
distracted
the
lead
demon
by
allowing
her
to
pummel
him
about
the
head
yeah
that
was
real
manly
how
you
shrieked
and
all
i
think
you'll
find
that
was
more
of
a
bellow
uh
what
do
we
do
with
the
trio
here
should
we
burn
them
i
brought
marshmallows
occasionally
i'm
callous
and
strange
i
expect
we
can
leave
them
i'm
more
interested
in
finding
out
what
they
are
and
whether
we
can
expect
more
of
their
kind
i
hope
not
they're
way
too
fit
i
say
bring
'em
on
uh
xander
i
think
in
the
future
perhaps
it
would
be
best
if
you
you
uh
hhung
back
to
the
rear
of
the
battle
you
know
for
your
own
sake
but
gee
mr
white
if
clark
and
lois
get
all
the
good
stories
i'll
never
be
a
good
reporter

stuff
mostly
math
and
spatial
relations
but
certainly
not
challenged
or
anything
can
i
get
you
another
soda
i
oughtta
cut
your
face
open
hey
hey
whoa
whoa
whoa
it
was
an
accident
you
wanna
be
startin'
somethin'
what
starting
something
like
that
michael
jackson
song
right
that
was
a
lot
of
fun
'too
high
to
get
over
yeah
yeah'
remember
that
fun
song
i
get
my
buddies
together
we're
gonna
kick
your
ass
till
it's
a
brandnew
shape
now
get
outta
here
yo
man
the
ball
boy
of
all
the
humiliations
you've
had
i've
witnessed
that
was
the
latest
i
could've
taken
him
oh
please
o'toole
would
macrame'
your
face
he
is
a
psycho
why
is
it
that
i've
come
facetoface
with
vampires
demons
the
most
hideous
creatures
hell
ever
spit
out
and
i'm
still
afraid
of
a
little
bully
like
jack
o'toole
because
unlike
all
those
creatures
that
you've
come
faceto
face
with
jack
actually
noticed
you
were
there
why
am
i
surprised
by
how
comforting
you're
not
it
must
be
really
hard
when
all
your
friends
have
like
superpowers
slayer
werewolf
witches
vampires
and
you're
like
this
little
nothing
you
must
feel
like
jimmy
olsen
i
was
just
talking
to
hey
mind
your
own
business
ooo
i
struck
a
nerve
the
boy
that
had
no
cool
i
happen
to
be
an
integral
part
of
that
group
i
happen
to
have
a
lot
to
offer
oh
please
i
do
'integral
part'
of
the
group
xander
you're
the
the
useless
part
of
the
group
you're
the
zeppo
'cool'
look
it
up
it's
something
that
a
subliterate
that's
repeated
twelfth
grade
three
times
has
and
you
don't
there
was
no
part
of
that
that
wasn't
fun
but
it's
just
that
it's
buggin'
me
this
'cool'
thing
i
mean
what
is
it
how
do
you
get
it
who
doesn't
have
it
and
who
decides
who
doesn't
have
it
what
is
the
essence
of
cool
not
sure
i
mean
you
yourself
oz
are
considered
more
or
less
cool
why
is
that
am
i
is
it
about
the
talking
you
know
the
way
you
tend
to
express
yourself
in
short
noncommittal
phrases
could
be
i
know
you're
in
a
band
that's
like
a
businessclass
ticket
to
cool
with
complementary
mojo
after
takeoff
i
gotta
learn
an
instrument
is
it
hard
to
play
guitar
not
the
way
i
play
it
okay
but
on
the
other
hand
eighth
grade
i'm
taking
the
fl√ºgelhorn
and
gettin'
zero
trim
so
the
whole
instrument
thing
could
be
a
mislead
but
you
need
a
thing
one
thing
nobody
else
has
what
do
i
have
an
exciting
new
obsession
which
i
feel
makes
you
very
special
now
with
the
mocking
which
i
can
handle
because
i
know
i'm
right
about
this
i'm
on
the
track
i
just
need
to
find
my
thing
it
seems
like
you're
overthinking
it
i
mean
you
got
some
identity
issues
it's
not
the
end
of
the
world
can
they
do
that
they
seem
fairly
committed
the
sisterhood
of
jhe
is
an
apocalypse
cult
they
exist
solely
to
bring
about
the
world's
destruction
and
we've
not
seen
the
last
of
them
more
will
follow
and
they're
here
in
sunnydale
for
what
demon
expo
buffy
this
is
no
laughing
matter
hence
my
no
laughing
i'm
sorry
i
know
i'm
no
longer
your
official
watcher
but
hey
hey
um
yyou're
cutting
it
a
bit
close
well
you
know
me
well
do
we
know
why
they're
here
i
think
so
based
on
some
artifacts
i
i
found
with
them
and
um
taking
into
account
the
current
astral
cycle
giles
i
don't
need
to
see
the
math
they
intend
to
open
the
hellmouth
the
hellmouth
the
one
that
opens
about
twenty
feet
from
where
you're
standing
and
if
it
opens
do
you
remember
the
demon
that
almost
got
out
the
night
i
died
every
nightmare
i
have
that
doesn't
revolve
around
academic
failure
or
public
nudity

about
that
thing
in
fact

i
dreamt
that
it
attacked
me
while
i
was
late
for
a
test

naked
well
it'll
be
the
first
to
come
out
and
giles
says
it
won't
be
the
worst
by
a
long
shot
the
world
will
be
overrun
with
demons
if
we
don't
stop
it
do
we
know
when
this
is
supposed
to
happen
giles
is
trying
to
narrow
it
down
iif
you're
up
for
it

heading
into
deep
research
mode

be
offended

these

belua
propulsanda

vitium
suum
noster
spes
sola

the
beast

giles
hey

something
different
about
this
menace

suddenly
very
up
it's
just
um
just

those
two
concepts

antithetical
don't

i'll
steer
you
around
the
curves

having
a
very
strange
night
that

it's
the
hellmouth

not
mad
at
me
in
the
morning

supplies
gotta
think
i
can't
believe
i
had
sex

what
to
do

let
me
decide
for
you

i
can
at
least
buy
you
enough
time
for
willow's
spell
to
bind
it
buffy
this
is
worse
than
anything
we've
ever
faced
it's
the
only
way
i
can't
watch
you
die
again
i
love
you
i
love
you
nothing
can
change
that
not
even
death
don't
talk
to
me
like
that
you
may
be
ready
to
go
but
i
am
not
ready
to
lose
you
okay
this
is
my
fight
and
if
you
won't
do
it
my
way
then
you're
hey
i've
got
this
um
there's
this
uh
it's
probably
a
bad
time
can
i
help
okay
okay
i
can
work
this
out
i
just
got
to
figure
out
what
they'd
be
likely
to
bomb
terra
vente
ignis
et
pluvia
cuncta
quattuor
numina
vos
obsecro
defendete
nos
a
recente
malo
resoluto
earth
wind
fire
and
rain
linger
four
gods
we
implore
you
defend
us
immediately
after
i
will
release
you
okay
oz
is
moved
he
could
barely
walk
after
that
mickey
i
gave
him
but
we
made
it
is
he
gonna
be
alright
there
anywhere
is
safer
than
here
um
help
me
with
the
candles
we're
doing
the
binding
spell
from
the
hebron's
almanac
yes
but
once
it's
ready
you're
to
stay
back
and
let
me
finish
the
recitation
don't
argue
i
want
you
safe
who
knows
what's
going
to
come
up
from
beneath
us
whoo
this
is
gonna
be
large
oh
yeah
giles
will
know
what
to
do
he's
way
more
calm
than
buffy
okay
i
got
a
plan
hey
our
wheels
hey
stop
c'mon
man
stop
where's
the
bomb
it's
in
it's
in
the
high
school
in
the
school
where
oh
god
this
really
really
hurts
stop
it's
in
the
it's
in
the
boiler
room
alright
now
i'm
gonna
ask
you
this
once
and
you
better
pray
you
get
the
answer
right
okay
okay
how
do
i
defuse
i
probably
should've
left
out
that
whole
middle
part
he's
headed
for
the
school
there
he
is
where's
a
slayer
when
you
need
one
oh
my
god
it's
grown
wow
c'mon
man
which
way
he
couldn't
have
gotten
far
let's
split
up
good
for
chopping
now
this
is
what
i
call
fun
should've
learned
by
now
if
you're
gonna
play
with
fire
you
gotta
expect
sooner
or
later
i
wasn't
finished
note
to
self
less
talk
faith
go
for
the
heart
okay
boiler
room
other
way
hello
nasty
less
than
two
minutes
dumb
guy
little
bomb
and
it
just
got
harder
i'm
not
leaving
till
that
thing's
disarmed
then
i
guess
you're
not
leaving
i'm
gonna
carve
you
up
and
serve
you
with
gravy
you
piss
me
off
boy
now
you
pay
the
price
first
the
eyes
then
the
tongue
i'm
gonna
break
every
one
of
your
fingers
you
gonna
do
all
that
in
fortynine
seconds
i
know
what
you're
thinkin'
can
i
get
by
him
get
up
the
stairs
out
of
the
building
seconds
ticking
away
i
don't
love
your
chances
then
you'll
die
too
yeah
looks
like
so
i
guess
the
question
really
is
who
has
less
fear
i'm
not
afraid
to
die
i'm
already
dead
yeah
but
this
is
different
being
blowed
up
isn't
walking
around
and
drinking
with
your
buddies
dead
it's
little
bits
being
swept
up
by
a
janitor
dead
and
i
don't
think
you're
ready
for
that
are
you
i
like
the
quiet
omnia
vasa
veritatis
all
things
the
vessel
of
truth
