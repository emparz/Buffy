it's
not
like
i
don't

great
pumpkin's

twenty
so
much
easier
to
talk
to
when
he
wanted
to
kill
me
ooh
go
help
giles
what
happened
to
xander
he
kept
poking
me
with
his
hook
i
sent
him
over
to
charmed
objects
with
any
luck
he'll
poke
the
wrong
one
and
end
up
in
an
alternative
dimension
inhabited
by
a
50foot
giles
that
squishes
annoying
teeny
pirates
we've
got
a
ton
of
bagging
to
do
here
actually
spike
had
a
really
good
idea
you
know
maybe
i
should
patrol
buffy
you've
been
patrolling
every
night
this
week
besides
it's
halloween
it's
the
one
time
of
the
year
that
supernatural
threats
give
it
a
welldeserved
rest
as
should
you
yeah
what
about
costumes
that
take
over
your
personality
or
wee
little
irish
feardemony
thingies
yes
well
if
anything
calamitous
should
happen
history
suggests
it'll
happen
to
one
of
us
right
exactly
so
i
should
patrol
to
avoid
any
of
that
and
i'm
bagging
da
da
da
da
dada
da
da
happy
halloween
ha
ha
give
you
something
special
this
year
come
again
uhh
in
a
zillion
years
store
go
boom
arr
that
was
the
most
incredible
thing
i
have
ever
experienced
except
for
that
what
you
all
did
for
me
tonight
the
astounding
heaps
of
money
you
helped
me
us
acquire
all
i
can
say
is
i
hope
we
make
as
much
tomorrow
tomorrow
oh
postholiday
clearance
the
cornerstone
of
retail
brooms
all
around
then
or
i
could
whip
up
a
jaunty
selfcleaning
incantation
it'll
be
like
fantasia
we
all
know
how
splendidly
that
turned
out
for
mickey
i
think
i'm
a
little
more
adept
than
a
cartoon
mouse
and
you
have
more
fingers
which
is
good
'cause
there's
no
need
to
wear
those
big
white
gloves
to
overcompensate
you
know
if
you
had
a
real
peg
leg
you
wouldn't
just
have
a
lame
costume
you'd
actually
be
lame
which
is
completely
different
you
do
this
every
night
every
time
i
close
out
the
cash
register
the
dance
of
capitalist
superiority
i'm
gonna
marry
that
girl
what
she's
fifteen
and
my
sister
so
don't
ev
oh
hey
everybody
can
i
um
uh
there's
something
anya
and
i
wanna
tell
you
now
now
we're
getting
married
oh
my
god
congratulations
that
that's
wow
it's
a
big
wow
i
i
thought
you
were
waiting
for
the
right
moment
i
did
here
have
some
money
did
you
know
about
this
no
unless
i
blocked
it
from
my
memory
much
as
i
will
xander's
vigorous
use
of
his
tongue
is
that
why
you're
always
cleaning
your
glasses
so
you
don't
have
to
see
what
we're
doing
tell
no
one
giles
this
is
we
have
to
do
something
and
he
said
he
couldn't
imagine
the
rest
of
his
life
without
me
and
then
he
gave
me
this
which
i'll
be
paying
for
the
rest
of
my
life
can
i
try
it
on
oh
absolutely
not
where
i
come
from
this
sort
of
thing
requires
much
in
the
way
of
libation
god
save
the
queen
sorry
we
couldn't
do
the
big
fancy
you
kinda
caught
us
with
our
parties
down
oh
that's
okay
this
is
just
the
first
premarital
celebration
there'll
be
lots
more
with
gifts
sure
maybe
we'll
even
have
time
to
decorate
for
the
next
one
why
wait
this
is
so
much
better
than
the
way
it
usually
looks
thank
you
the
grocery
store's
still
open
we
could've
bought
decorations
there
why
bother
these
are
perfect
and
extra
biodegradabley
in
a
couple
of
hours
poof
no
they're
they're
great
it's
just
why
use
magic
when
you
can
do
something
naturally
well
you
can
fight
monsters
naturally
with
sticks
and
stones
don't
recommend
it
though
it's
different
how
becau
because
you're
protecting
people
keeping
them
from
being
hurt
which
makes
them
happy
like
pretty
decorations
made
anya
happy
that's
not
the
point
will
why
are
you
being
like
this
this
isn't
about
me
this
is
so
about
you
you're
always
coming
down
on
me
for
for
doing
magic
that
couldn't
harm
a
fly
what's
your
problem

jjust

there
dawn
tell
them
dude
where'd
you
get
the
cool
toys
used
to
design
'em
back
in
'58
nothing
would
give
me
more
pleasure
than
to
see
a
child's
face
light
up
when
he'd
open
one
of
mine
on
a
christmas
or
a
birthday
i
was
good
jeepers
i
was
the
best
and
then
that
thing
happened
one
little
mistake
and
they
took
it
all
away
from
me
they
they
took
my
toys
time
for
the
treats
who
wants
to
help
daddy
in
the
kitchen
how
'bout
you
sally
uh
sally's
not
much
for
the
cookin'
why
don't
i
give
you
a
hand
hands
are
good
always
use
more
hands
more
hands
okay
i
say
we
get
the
funk
out
of
here
before
satan
claus
tries
to
stuff
us
up
the
chimney
what
and
miss
the
big
treat
that
would
break
the
old
guy's
little
heart
assuming
it's
still
beating
she's
right
we
should
just
get
justin
and
go
come
on
the
dude's
a
thousand
years
old
what's
he
gonna
do
drown
us
in
his
drool
cup
hey
where's
its
head
boo
what
the
hell
was
that
justin
justin
let's
go
whwhat
happened
i
swiped
his
wallet
when
he
wasn't
looking
come
on
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
dude
that
guy
was
rank
bet
a
spritz
of
dawn
would
wash
that
right
out
so
what
do
you
think
lunchables
or
should
we
go
all
the
way
and
turn
'em
so
i
was
thinking
maybe
a
june
wedding
but
then
i
remembered
that
they
always
had
the
highest
percentage
of
calls
for
vengeance
so
now
i'm
leaning
towards
as
soon
as
damn
possible
i
mean
mortal
life
being
so
short
we
gotta
get
in
as
much
marital
bliss
as
we
can
before
we
wither
and
die
i
mean
there's
just
so
much
to
consider
though
i
mean
planning
the
wedding
and
and
new
cars
house
and
babies
you
have
to
plan
for
babies
or
they
just
run
roughshod
over
your
entire
existence
yeah
yyou
gotta
know
what
to
call
'em
before
they
hit
college
ah
rupert
is
an
exceptionally
strong
name
ha
ha
ha
yeah
if
we
want
our
progeny
to
eat
paste
and
have
their
lunch
money
stolen
look
all
that
matters
is
that
they're
happy
everything
else
is
thick
gravy
goodness
i
know
i
mean
i
am
the
luckiest
exdemon
in
the
world
i
mean
to
be
able
to
find
the
one
person
in
all
dimensions
that
i
was
meant
to
be
with
and
have
everything
work
out
exactly
as
i
dreamed
i
mean
how
often
does
the
universe
allow
that
to
happen
air
sweet
mother
oxygen
you
okay
yeah
i
just
it's
just
i
didn't
think
it
would
be
so
much
but
this
is
good
i
mean
this
is
love
and
celebration
and
moving
forward
anya's
right
this
is
the
way
life's
supposed
to
work
out
right
deep
pools
of
ooey
delight
i'm
wallowing
not
drowning
definite
wallow
action
okay
so
once
more
into
the
breach
oh
i
think
my
breaches
are
wearing
a
little
thin
i'm
gonna
take
spike
up
on
that
offer
to
patrol
gotta
be
something
out

pretty
hard

ignore
this
kind
of
behavior
something
needs
to
be
done
before
it
spins
out
of
control
you're
right
i'm
glad
you're
here
to
take
care
of
