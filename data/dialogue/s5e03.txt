wish

something
foodlike

hot
plate's
out
of
commission
we
think
the
cat
peed
on
it
i
do
have
spaghettio's
set
'em
on
top
of
the
dryer
and

a
fluff
cycle

lunch
ah
i
guess
the
folks
are
back
no
no
i
was
wrong
just
incompetent
burglars
yeah
maybe
it's
definitely
time
to
start
looking
for
a
new
place
something
a
little
nicer
buffy
you've
been
to
hell
they
have
onebedrooms
right
hey
buffy
how's
that
book
full
of
zippy
dates
and
zesty
names
i'm
fine
heyyy
i'm
enjoying
the
studying
who
are
you
lately
give
it
up
and
watch
the
movie
i
guess
it
has
been
a
long
day
with
the
crusades
i
can
take
a
little
break
from
the
violence
for
some
ooh
fighting
incompetentlydubbed
kung
fu
our
most
valuable
chinese
import
much
more
durable
than
their
hot
plates
just
relax
mm
mm
that
feels
good
ow
what
are
you
doing
i
have
a
dislocated
shoulder
i'm
trying
to
concentrate
on
the
kicking
movie
hey
rubbing
went
away
oh
sorry
i
got
caught
up
in
the
action
yeah
it's
pretty
good
oh
give
me
a
break
this
is
all
wrong
see
first
you
would
get
the
big
guy
with
a
flying
kick
then
you
would
take
out
all
the
little
ones
bam
ba
see
now
with
the
flying
kick
from
a
dead
stop
what's
powering
it
raw
enthusiasm
hey
buff
maybe
you
oughta
leave
the
work
behind
sometimes
you're
not
always
on
slayer
duty
you
know
it
would
drive
you
crazy
if
we
were
watching
an
army
movie
and
they
were
all
saluting
backwards
and
invading
all
willynilly
and
anyway
i
mean
you
know
you
can't
blame
me
for
being
critical
willow's
the
same
way
when
we
watch
a
a
movie
about
witches
right
xander
what
oh
yeah
she's
all
like
what's
that
a
cauldron
who
uses
a
cauldron
any
more
cut
to
a
dark
lair
filled
with
steam
or
smoke
cheesy
dramatic
music
a
demon
is
tending
to
a
huge
cauldron
full
of
bubbling
yellow
liquid
steam
rises
from
it
the
demon
pulls
the
hood
of
his
cloak
back
so
we
can
see
he
has
brownish
skin
with
cracks
through
which
yellowish
ligh
shows
his
eyes
are
sunken
and
red
and
his
voice
is
very
deep
the
last
step
in
thy
forging
is
my
pain
the
price
with
which
i
purchase
the
death
of
the
slayer
if
you
get
the
apartment
this'll
be
your
hallway
we'll
walk
down
this
hall
and
we'll
say
la
la
i'm
on
my
way
to
xander's
buffy
just
warning
you
xander
i
probably
won't
be
doing
that
really
i
will
hey

way
high
so
don't
get
your
hopes

albert

is
me
doing
an
important
voice

excellent
tenant

very
nicelooking
fellow'
anya

a
door

and

and
not
subterranean
it's
very
uh
aboveterranean
i
want
it
pay
anything
xander
harris
uh
no
riley
finn
this
is
xander
hey
ah
i
brought
my
friends
i
see
they
wouldn't
always
be
around
but
we're
clean
andand
quiet
we
can
have
the
scooby
meetings
in
the
living
room
andand
giles
can
explain
the
boring
things
over
there
oh
there's
a
microwave
it
would
be
like
having
hot
and
cold
running
popcorn
phone
and
electricity
are
hooked
up
there's
a
private
balcony
ceiling
fan
closet
space
and
that's
the
bedroom
guys
you
can't
save
it
for
the
bedroom
okay
good
point
i
brought
an
application
for
you
to
fill
out
an
application
i
can't
just
tell
you
my
references
because
there's
albert
we
run
your
credit
check
based
on
the
application
oh
credit
check
little
check
on
the
credit
see
how
credible
my
checks
are
and
we'll
be
asking
for
first
last
security
and
a
small
cleaning
deposit
the
total's
at
the
bottom
of
the
sheet
there
he'll
take
it
xander
go
get
the
furniture
i'll
wait
here
he's
been
living
in
his
drunken
parents'
basement
where
something
urinated
on
the
hot
plate
anya
can
we
talk
quietly
over
there
excuse
us
uh
we
uh
we
like
the
ceiling
fan
yes
it's
very
you
know
kind
of
old
south
but
without
the
unpleasant
slavery
associations
but
why
can't
we
have
it
i
told
you
my
construction
job
is
ending
and
i
won't
have
any
more
money
coming
in
and
by
the
way
you
do
have
your
own
place
so
when
i
wanna
visit
you
i
have
to
be
in
that
awful
basement
not
forever
just
until
things
come
together
which
is
when
xander
'cause
right
now
things
are
looking
pretty
untogether
and
you
can't
expect
me
just
to
wait
around
for
quiet
please
anya
what
is
this
what's
going
on
with
you
what's
going
on
with
me
is
my
arm
hurts
and
i'm
tired
and
i
don't
really
feel
like
taking
a
tour
of
beautiful
things
i
can't
have
i
guess
i'll
just
start
on
that
application
i
think
you'll
like
it
i've
been
told
i
have
lovely
penmanship
miscellaneous
curses
brilliant
be
lucky
if
i
don't
curse
my
hands
off
at
the
wrist
oh
the
slayer
is
not
here
rabbit's
foot
no
wait
that
is
a
fertility
god
feeble
man
you
are
not
going
to
distract
me
giles
hits
him
in
the
head
with
the
statue
he
reels
backward
giles
hits
him
with
the
statue
a
few
more
times
then
toth
shoves
giles
and
he
falls
into
a
pile
of
boxes
you
are
not
the
slayer
you
do
not
concern
me
like
this
and
this
and
this
that
thing's
pretty
heavy
that's
oofdar
goddess
of
childbirth
she's
got
some
nice
heft
to
her
how
badly
did
you
hurt
him
well
hurt
uh
maybe
not
hurt
well
ii'm
sure
he
was
startled
uh
yes
yes
i'd
imagine
it
gave
him
uh
rather
a
turn
he
ran
away
huh
um
sort
of
more
uh
turned
and
swept
out
majestically
i
suppose
he
said
i
didn't
concern
him
so
a
mythic
triumph
over
a
completely
indifferent
foe
well
i'm
not
dead
or
unconscious
so
i
say
bravo
for
me
some
good
demons
in
this
one
see
if
your
guy's
in
here
so
you
bought
the
magic
shop
and
you
were
attacked
before
it
opened
who's
up
for
a
swingin'
chorus
of
the
we
told
you
so
symphony
owning
this
place
does
seem
kinda
dangerous
toth
what
he
called
you
a
toth
it's
a
british
expression
it
means
like
moron
no
toth
is
the
name
of
the
demon
be
careful
with
that
ancient
demon
very
strong
last
survivor
of
the
tothric
clan
it
also
says
that
for
a
demon
he's
unusually
sophisticated
sophisticated
so
i
should
discuss
men's
fashions
with
him
before
i
chop
his
head
off
they're
referring
to
the
fact
that
he
does
not
fight
barehanded
he
uses
tools
devices
oh
he's
also
supposed
to
be
very
focused
and
since
he
mentioned
the
slayer
i
think
we
know
what
the
focus
is
he
mentioned
buffy
where
do
we
find
him
and
how
hard
can
i
kill
him
well
there's
no
mention
of
the
types
of
places
he
might
frequent
but

i
have
an
idea
he
had
a
very
specific
olfactory
presence
well
i
guess
we're
off
to
the
olfactory
i
hate
that
place
i'm
joking
i
know
what
it
means
he
smelled
right
some
demon
rituals
involve
anointing
with
oils
was
it
sort
of
sandalwoody
um
not
even
remotely
but
he
was
very
um
distinctive
the
city
dump
where
smells
go
to
relax
and
be
themselves
people
say
they're
recycling
they're
not
recycling
i
found
a
spell
so
you
can't
smell
anything
but
it
does
it
by
taking
your
nose
off
so
no
what
are
you
doing
here
spike
oh
there's
a
nice
lady
vampire
who
set
up
a
charming
tea
room
over
the
next
pile
of
crap
what
do
you
think
i'm
doing
i'm
scavenging
ain't
i
very
pretty
spike
um
we're
looking
for
a
demon
um
tall
robed
skin
sort
of
hanging
off
deep
voice

great
tall
robey
thing

don't
be
scared
will
just
listen
it's
me
xander
and
i
can
prove
it
um
okay
let's
see
stuff
only
you
and
me
know
okay
on
my
seventh
birthday
i
wanted
a
toy
fire
truck
and
i
didn't
get
it
and
you
were
real
nice
about
it
and
then
the
house
next
door
burnt
down
and
then
real
fire
trucks
came
and
for
years
i
thought
you
set
the
fire
for
me
and
if
you
did
you
can
tell
me
for
a
while
last
year
i
thought
i
was
lactoseintolerant
but
it
was
just
some
bad
brie
oh
every
christmas
we
watch
charlie
brown
together
and
i
do
the
snoopy
dance
xander
stop
dancing
aha
you
called
me
xander
xander
shut
up
why
wouldn't
i
think
you
were
xander
oh
huh
what's
goin'
on
okay
i
woke
up
in
the
dump
this
morning
xander
the
basement
isn't
a
dump
it
it's
more
like
a
really
nice
hovel
no
the
dump
the
city
dump
i
got
hit
last
night
fall
down
boom
woke
up
this
morning
nuh
uh
we
walked
you
home
last
night
remember
you
walked
will
did
i
do
anything
weird
did
i
wave
any
shiny
things
around
shiny
things
what
are
you
talking
about
last
night
that
wasn't
me
there's
a
double
out
there
some
thing
has
stolen
my
face
and
it's
going
around
pretending
to
be
me
and
it's
hypnotizing
people
it
even
got
to
buffy
and
giles
and
riley
it's
over
there
right
now
and
they
have
no
idea
what's
intriguing
me
is
that
there
are
any
number
of
demons
with
the
ability
to
mimic
a
simple
form
but
uh
this
sounds
like
more
than
that
hold
up
do
we
really
have
to
figure
out
what
it
is
let's
just
go
kill
it
yeah
when
the
imposter's
killed
the
body'll
probably
turn
back
into
whatever
it
really
is
and
then
we'll
know
toth
the
demon
with
the
creepy
stick
thing
toth
it's
gotta
be
he
hit
xander
with
that
blast
and
somehow
it
allowed
him
to
take
xander's
form
couldn't
that
be
what
the
creepy
stick
thing
did
yes
i
suppose
yes
yes
it
makes
sense
a
shapeshifting
device
it
does
make
sense
it
must
be
toth
it's
a
robot
it's
an
evil
robot
constructed
from
evil
parts
that
look
like
me
designed
to
do
evil
uh
huh
or
it's
toth
or
it's
toth
i
was
gonna
look
for
toth
anyway
guess
now
i
start
looking
for
you
should
i
go
with
you
i
told
anya
to
meet
me
at
my
new
place
i'd
feel
a
whole
lot
better
knowing
she's
safe
from
this
creep
go
be
with
her
i
i
mean
if
you
were
out
there
looking
for
the
double
too

let's
just
say
that
i
wouldn't
wanna
run
into
you
and
kill
the
wrong
one
good
thinking
when
you
kill
this
thing
you
better
make
sure
you
got
the
one's
who's
actually
cut
back
to
willow's
a
demon
a
demon
has
taken
my
life
from
me
and
he's
living
it
better
than
i
do
well
we're
working
on
it
there
has
to
be
a
way
to
get
to
buffy
to
unhypnotize
her
i'll
find
a
spell
to
snap
her
out
of
it
right
whatever
xander
you
sound
a
little
you
have
to
help
me
figure
this
out
you
know
but
i
never
help
i
get
in
trouble
and
buffy
saves
me
that's
not
true
sometimes
we
all
helped
save
you
and
sometimes
you're
not
in
trouble
i'm
just
another
great
humiliation
but
this
time
it's
even
worse
this
demon
he's
like
taking
my
life
and
everyone's
treating
him
everyone's
treating
him
like
a
grownup
will
i'm
starting
to
feel
like
like
what
like
he's
doing
everything
better
he's
smarter
and

i
don't
know
maybe
i
should
just
let
him
have
it
take
my
life
please
xander
no
you're
just
tired
and
and
all
soggy
that's
why
it
seems
so
hard
but
you
can't
let
him
just
take
your
whole
existence
why
not
it's
not
like
i
was
doing
anything
so
great
with
it
when
i
get
to
the
pearly
gates
i'm
sure
the
guy
is
not
gonna
go
hey
what
a
kickass
comic
book
collection
come
on
in
no
what
have
i
got
that's
even
worth
anya
you
think
he's
after
her
she
won't
know
he
can
just
no
no
way
no
way
he
can
take
anything
but
he
can't
have
her
i
need
her
really
he
could
be
with
her
right
now
figure
out
a
spell
something
revealy
i
gotta
find
her
xander
you
already
knew
he
was
taking
over
your
life
and
you
didn't
think
about
anya
till
just
now
hey
wait
till
you
have
an
evil
twin
see
how
you
handle
it
i
handled
it
fine
anya
an
meet
me
at
the
apartment
you
know
the
one
900
it's
gotta
be
here
where
is
it
you're
lying
it's
a
trick
no
trust
me
you
really
got
this
apartment
i
really
did
and
do
you
know
why
the
ceiling
fans
very
attractive
no
it's
because
i
knew
you
wanted
it
it's
all
for
you
anya
you
didn't
see
me
today
did
you
i
mean
we
didn't
talk
what
do
you
mean
i
just
got
your
phone
message
that's
all
good
so
what
happens
next
well
at
some
point
we
take
off
our
clothes
i
mean
what
happens
next
in
our
lives
when
do
we
get
a
car
a
car
and
a
boat
no
wait
i
i
don't
mean
a
boat
i
mean
a
puppy
or
a
child
i
have
a
list
somewhere
what
are
you
talking
about
just
we
have
to
get
going
i
don't
have
time
just
to
let
these
things
happen
there's
no
hurry
yes
there
is
there's
a
hurry
xander
i'm
dying
i
may
have
as
few
as
fifty
years
left
fifty
years
what
is
thi
oh
wait
a
minute
this
is
about
this
what
about
the
sling
you
haven't
been
hurt
like
this
since
you
became
human
maybe
it's
finally
hitting
you
what
being
human
means
no
that's
not
it
yes
i
think
it
is
you
were
gonna
live
for
thousands
of
years
and
now
you're
gonna
age
and
die
that
must
be
terrifying
you
don't
understand
what
it's
like
being
suddenly
human
i
think
i
can
get
what
that
would
be
like
and
we
can
get
through
it
together
you
can't
make
it
any
different
i'm
going
to
get
old
and
you
can't
promise
you'll
be
with
me
when
i'm
wrinkly
and
my
teeth
are
artificial
and
stuck
into
my
wrinkly
mouth
with
an
adhesive
no
i
can't
promise
that
but
it
doesn't
sound
terrible
and
that's
saying
something
i
promise
you
anya
very
soon
you
won't
be
thinking
about
getting
older
get
away
from
her
xander
xander
get
out
you
don't
belong
here
anya
it's
me
it's
a
demon
he
stole
my
face
he's
trying
to
trick
you
anya
you
know
i'm
me
right
no
what
is
it
make
it
go
away
so
you're
thinking
we
split
up
yeah
you
check
the
places
where
he
might
try
and
go
and
blend
in
as
xander
i'll
check
the
places
where
toth
might
hang
out
i
swear
this
time
i
know
i
had
that
locked
buffy
toth
looks
like
xander
we
already
know
we're
on
our
way
wait
a
second
how
did
you
know
about
this
he
came
to
me
ii
mean
xander
did
and
he's
in
terrible
shape
we
need
to
help
him
he
came
to
us
too
no
we
each
had
a
xander
i
mean
you
didn't
have
a
xander
you
had
a
a
demon
in
a
xander
suit
what
makes
you
so
sure
that
yours
is
the
right
one
he
knew
stuff
he
he
did
the
snoopy
dance
buffy
it
was
xander
and
he
needs
us
oh
dear
lord
buffy
our
xander
did
he
seem
a
little
buffy
he
seemed
kind
of
forceful
and
confident
that's
not
xander
i
said
oh
dear
lord
buffy
you
always
say
that
well
it's
always
important
neither
xander
is
a
demon
um
is
one
of
them
a
robot
what
no
um
uh
the
rod
device
it's
called
a
ferulagemina
it
splits
one
person
in
half
distilling
personality
traits
into
two
separate
bodies
as
near
as
i
can
tell
toth
was
attempting
to
split
the
slayer
into
two
different
entities
two
buffys
yes
one
with
all
the
qualities
inherent
in
buffy
summers
and
the
other
one
with
everything
that
belongs
to
the
slayer
alone
the
uh
thethe
strength
the
uh
speed
the
heritage
and
when
it
hit
xander
i
think
it
separated
him
into
his
strongest
points
and
his
weakest
but
which
one's
the
real
one
they're
both
real
they're
both
xander
neither
one
of
them
is
evil
there's
nothing
in
either
of
them
that
our
xander
doesn't
already
possess
i
still
don't
get
the
original
plan
i
mean
why
do
it
the
slayer
half
would
be
like
slayer
concentrate
pretty
unkillable
but
the
two
halves
can't
exist
without
each
other
kill
the
weaker
buffy
half
and
the
slayer
half
dies
so
the
same
goes
for
the
xanders
we
lose
one
we
lose
them
both
he's
the
demon
or
possibly
a
robot
look
at
me
look
in
my
eyes
can't
you
see
it's
me
i
i
don't
know
please
look
at
him
listen
to
him
he's
all
smooth
you
have
to
know
it's
me
don't
worry
anya
i'll
get
rid
of
this
thing
i'm
thinkin'
this
is
gonna
last
about
fifteen
seconds
i'm
thinkin'
less
no
don't
shoot
him
can't
this
thing
go
any
faster
ultimate
driving
machine
my
ass
we're
pushing
70
riley
do
you
wish
riley
no
no
you
don't
even
know
what
i
was
gonna
say
yes
i
do
you
wanted
to
know
if
i
wished
you
got
hit
by
the
ferulagemina
got
split
in
two
well
you
have
been
kind
of
rankly
about
the
whole
slayer
gig
instead
of
having
slayer
buffy
you
could
have
buffy
buffy
hey
i
have
buffy
buffy
being
the
slayer's
part
of
who
you
are
you
keep
thinking
i
don't
get
that
but
it's
just
i
know
how
unfun
it
can
be
the
bad
hours
frequent
bruising
cranky
monsters
buffy
if
you
led
a
perfectly
normal
life
you
wouldn't
be
half
as
crazy
as
you
are
i
gotta
have
that
i
gotta
have
it
all
i'm
talkin'
toes
elbows
the
whole
badiceskatingmovie
obsession

no
part
of
you

but
you're
both
xander
and
you
can't
kill
each
other
um
well
you
could
but
it
would
be
really
bad
no
way
he
can't
be
me
he's
all
fancy
we
can
prove
that
you're
both
xander
yeah
how
um
um
well
there
has
to
be
a
way
ooh
what
number
am
i
thinking
of
i
don't
think
that's
gonna
do
it
eleven
and
a
half
wrong
oh
but
see
no
we're
not
the
same
we're
all
different
different
properties
went
into
each
of
you
but
you're
both
xander
different
properties
what
different
properties
uh
uh
you
know
uh
sense
of
direction
good
night
vision
stuff
like
that
oh
but
he
has
a
thingy
in
his
pocket
a
shiny
disk
that
stuns
and
disorients
what
disk
cover
your
eyes
this
it'll
melt
your
brain
look
it's
a
nickel
someone
flattened
on
the
railroad
track
i
found
it
on
the
construction
site
and
i
thought
it
was
cool
it's
not
magic
no
i
huh
it
is
kinda
cool
ashington's
still
there
but
he's
all
smushy
and
he
may
be
jefferson
okay
isn't
anyone
gonna
tell
me
why
there
are
two
xanders
i
will
on
the
way
to
giles'
let's
go
oh
great
rod
boy
i
will
not
miss
again
slayer
the
gun
pick
up
the
little
gun
pieces
hey
i
just
made
a
small
cleaning
deposit
sword
oh
yeah
that
cleaning
deposit's
gone
i
was
thinking
the
same
thing
hey
do
you
suppose
we're
both
xander
look
and
admire
ladies
look
there's
a
scar
there
and
there's
the
same
one
right
there
it's
all
double
this
zit
and
this
kinda
funny
dippy
thing
aand
this
weird
little
hair
that
grows
in
the
wrong
way
okay
back
off
ladies
psychologically
this
is
fascinating
doesn't
it
make
everyone
wanna
lock
them
in
separate
rooms
and
do
experiments
on
them
just
me
then
so
you
xanders
really
do
have
all
the
same
memories
all
the
same

physical
attributes
we're
completely
identical
yeah
we
checked
out
some
stuff
in
the
car
on
the
way
over
fingerprints
well
maybe
we
shouldn't
do
this
reintegration
thing
right
away
see
i
can
take
the
boys
home
and
we
can
all
have
sex
together
and
you
know
just
slap
'em
back
together
in
the
morning
she's
joking
no
she's
not
she
entirely
wants
to
have
sex
with
us
together
which
is
wrong
and
and
it
would
be
very
confusing
uh
uh
we
just
need
to
light
the
candles
also
we
should
continue
to
pretend
we
heard
none
of
the
disturbing
sex
talk
check
candles
and
pretense
it's
not
like
it'd
be
cheating
they're
both
xander
now
hold
on
a
sec
if
you
weren't
putting
a
whammy
on
people
with
the
shiny
thing
how'd
you
do
it
how'd
you
get
the
promotion
well
i'm
good
at
that
stuff
i
am
yeah
and
hey
how
'bout
that
lady
huh
the
apartment
manager
how
weird
was
it
when
she
called
me
mister
we're
ready
we
should
do
it
now
what'll
we
do
if
this
doesn't
work
kill
us
both
spock
they're
kinda
the
same
now
yes
he's
clearly
a
bad
influence
on
himself
hey
summon
the
goddess
chant
the
chant
let's
do
it
actually
it's
not
that
hard
your
natural
state
is
to
be
together
toth's
spell
is
doing
all
the
work
of
keeping
you
apart
i
just
have
to
break
it
so
you
two

stand
right
here
side
by
side
we
don't
want
you
to
end
up
with
two
fronts
now
do
we
are
you
sure
you
know
how
to
do
this
here
we
go
brace
yourselves
let
the
spell
be
ended
you
gotta
be
kidding
let
the
spell
be
ended
that's
not
gonna
work
oh
i
liked
it
the
other
way
put
him
back
getting
nostalgic
i
don't
know
at
first
it's
just
a
place
then
you
start
to
make
memories
and
then
you're
like
that's
where
spike
slept
and
there
that's
where
anya
and
i
drowned
the
separvo
demon
oh
and
and
right
there
that's
where
i
got
my
heart
all
ripped
out
i
really
hate
this
place
anya
i
see
you've
joined
the
nonslingwearing
crowd
yes
i'm
feeling
better
and
i
anticipate
many
years
before
my
death
excepting
disease
or
airbag
failure
that
sounds
nice
ooh
presents
not
unless
you
want
my
collection
of
babylon

commemorative
plates

just
thought

strength

we
just
load
her
up
like
one

those
little
horses

your
slave

is
it
that
she
can
always
make
me
feel
suavexander's
left
the
building
you
two
have
your
friction
but
she
digs
the
whole
package
it's
obvious
still
i
do
envy
you
sometimes
i
mean
for
the
sanity
not
that
i'm
still
into
buffy
not
that
i
ever
was
hey
i'm
well
aware
of
how
lucky
i
am
like
lottery

buffy's
like
nobody
else
in
the
world
when
i'm
with
her
it's
like
it's
like
i'm
split
in
two
half
of
me
is
just
on
fire
going
crazy
if
i'm
not
touching
her
the
other
half
is
so
still
and
peaceful
just
perfectly
content
just
knows
this
is
the
one
but
she
doesn't
love
me

something
else
for
me
to
carry
uh

can
help
me
