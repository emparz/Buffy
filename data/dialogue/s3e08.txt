this
is
a
nightmare
this
is
my
world
is
spinning
it's
not
that
bad
willow
really
740
verbal
i'mi'm
pathetic
that's
right
and
the
fact
that
your
740
verbal
closely
resembles
my
combined
scores
in
no
way
compromises
your
position
as
the
village
idiot
i
just
where
did
i
go
wrong
you
did
amazing
willow
as
usual
you
guys
get
your
scores
cordelia
willow
was
very
sad
by
her
academic
failure
how
did
you
do
this
is
not
good
what's
not
good
well
i'm
just
worried
it
may
hurt
my
standing
as
campus
stud
when
people
find
out
i'm
dating
a
brain
please
i
have
some
well
i
can
see
why
you'd
be
upset
that
was
my
sarcastic
voice
you
know
it
sounds
a
lot
like
your
regular
voice
i've
been
told
that
but
we
should
celebrate
do
something
like
the
four
of
us
a
double
date
it
could
have
potential
buffy
hey
did
you
get
your
sat
scores
by
the
look
on
your
face
i'm
guessing
you
and
i
are
gonna
be
manning
the
drivethrough
window
side
by
side
they're
just
test
scores
right
what
do
they
really
mean
anyway
1430
buffy
you
kicked
ass
okay
so
academic
achievement
gets
me
a
little
excited
buff
that's
amazing
let
me
see
that
yeah
with
scores
like
that
you
can
apply
pretty
much
anywhere
you
want
buffy
this
could
like
change
your
whole
future
the
thought
had
occurred
to
me
then
why
the
sour
puss
i
don't
know
i
guess
my
future
i
never
really
thought
about
it
i
wasn't
even
sure
i
was
going
to
have
one
well
i
think
this
is
great
now
you
can
leave
and
never
come
back
well
i
mean
that
in
a
positive
way
get
out
of
sunnydale
home
sweet
home
and
more
much
more
than
this
i
did
it
my
way
cut
to
the
bedroom
in
the
basement
spike
comes
hopping
merrily
down
the
stairs
drusilla
i'm
home
why
did
you
do
it
baby
why
did
you
leave
me
we
were
happy
here
you
stupid
c'mon
it'll
be
fun
i
don't
know
i
just
thought
we
were
gonna
do
something
you
know
classy
what's
classier
than
bowling
apart
from
everything
ever
oz
and
willow
are
down
you're
the
swing
vote
i
guarantee
fun
hey
those
are
from
the
pier
yeah
uh
i
just
got
them
developed
there's
pictures
of
me
in
your
locker
i
never
knew
i
was
locker
door
material
well
just
barely
besides
i
look
really
cute
in
those
pictures
hey
so
what's
the
verdict
do
we
bowl
we
bowl
great
double
bowling
date
i'm
on
oz's
team
yeah
well
prepare
to
be
crushed
maybe
we
should
practice
yeah
they
don't
stand
a
chance
i'm
really
good
or
i
used
to
be
when
they
had
the
inflatable
things
in
the
gutters
what's
this
it's
a
gift
what's
the
occasion
pretty
much
you
are
it's
a
little
uh
pez
witch
it's
kind
of
a
theme
present
do
you
like
it
i
like
ii
more
than
like
oz
this
is
probably
the
sweetest
we
have
to
find
a
little
pez
werewolf
so
little
pez
witch
can
have
a
boyfriend
i
don't
think
they
make
a
werewolf
pez
you
might
have
to
settle
for
a
wacky
cartoon
dog
this
is
just
so
thoughtful
well
i
think
about
you
oh
i
don't
have
anything
to
give
you
yeah
you
do
buffy
this
is
this
is
remarkable
so
is
this
where
is
this
retreat
thingy
the
yukon
it's
quite
nearby
actually
it's
um
it's
the
clearing
at
the
top
of
breaker's
woods
it's
the
site
of
some
fascinating
druidic
rituals
okay
but
you're
just
going
for
a
few
days
right
i
mean
you're
not
gonna
settle
there
and
grow
crops
or
anything
what
oh
my
gear
no
no
this
is
this
is
basic
necessities
giles
you
pack
like
me
here
i
suspect
your
mother
will
want
to
uh
put
it
on
the
refrigerator
yeah
she
saw
these
scores
and
her
head
spun
around
and
exploded
ii've
been
on
the
hellmouth
too
long
yes
she
was
happy
she
started
with
all
this
crazy
talk
about
me
going
to
college
maybe
someplace
else
i
know
i
know
i
said
that
you
were
gonna
have
a
goat
responsibilities
and
all
i
know
the
drill
she
may
be
right
yeah
i
know
i
figured
you'd
okay
be
kind
rewind
with
scores
like
these
buffy
you
could
have
a
firstrate
education
i'm
i'm
not
suggesting
that
you
ignore
your
calling
but
um
you
need
to
look
to
your
future
and
with
faith
here
iiit
may
be
that
you
can
move
on
for
aa
time
at
least
wow
well
let's
um
let's
discuss
it
when
i
get
back
iin
the
meantime
um
i'd
like
you
to
continue
training
while
i'm
while
i'm
gone
and
um
please
don't
do
anything
rash
'anything
rash'
meaning
are
you
planning
on
seeing
angel
yes
actually
i
am
look
but
there's
not
gonna
be
any
rash
anywhere
okay
we're
we're
friends
that's
all
either
of
us
wants
nothing's
gonna
happen
something's
gonna
happen
like
what
uh
it's
a
mistake
it's
a
terrible
fatal
mistake
i
see
that
now
it's
just
bowling
it's
bad
bowling
iit's
a
double
date
with
all
of
us
and
they're
gonna
know
how
are
they
gonna
know
it's
a
very
intimate
situation
it's
all
sexy
with
the
smoke
and
the
sweating
and
the
shoe
rental
you're
turned
on
by
rented
shoes
that's
not
the
issue
okay
well
let
me
ask
you
this
what
are
they
gonna
know
that
we're
friends
old
old
friends
and
maybe
we've
had
one
or
two
indiscretions
but
that's
all
past
look
we're
just
very
good
friends
who
like
to
hang
out
and
can
i
kiss
your
earlobe
no
well
okay
no
pez
maybe
bowling
might
be
too
much
to
handle
man
i
wish
i
wasn't
so
attracted
to
you
i
wish
we
could
make
it
all
stop
any
suggestions
carnegie
mellon
has
a
wonderful
design
curriculum
oh
and
brown
university's
history
program
is
you
like
history
right
could
we
talk
about
this
another
time
all
day
it's
been
like
'congratulations
go
away'
that's
not
it
it's
just
you
belong
at
a
a
good
oldfashioned
college
with
with
keg
parties
and
boys
not
here
with
hellmouths
and
vampires
not
really
seeing
the
distinction
y'know
you're
always
talking
about
how
you
wish
you
could
lead
a
more
normal
life
well
this
is
your
chance
yeah
it's
just
not
that
simple
i
have
responsibilities
i
know
i
know
but
i
spoke
with
mr
giles
and
he
said
that
faith
could
be
miss
sunnydale
in
the
slayer
pageant
i
know
it's
time
to
think
about
your
future
buffy
about
your
whole
life
i
mean
honestly
is
there
anything
keeping
you
here
yeah
you
you
think
i'm
afraid
of
you
we
were
happy
you
brainwashed
her
i
could
just
yeah
i'll
show
you
who's
a
cool
guy
you're
goin'
down
whoa
this
is
just
too
much
did
you
come
in
through
the
back
yeah
i
need
a
curse
a
what
a
curse
y'know
something
nasty
boils
i
wanna
give
him
boils
all
over
his
face
you
know
dripping
pustules
let's
really
go
for
the
gusto
here
i'm
hearing
a
lot
of
negative
energy
and
i
bet
leprosy
alright
a
spell
that
makes
his
parts
fall
off
that
sounds
proper
we
don't
carry
leprosy
would
you
excuse
me
a
moment
blessed
be
anything
in
particular
i
can
help
you
find
yeah
it's
all
here
on
the
list
skink
root
essence
of
rose
thorn
canary
feathers
aha
a
love
spell
want
that
old
lover
to
come
back
to
you
are
you
sure
you
know
what
you're
doing
hon
no
oh
i
mean
yes
i
i
know
how
to
do
a
love
spell
but
this
is
more
of
an
antilove
spell
yeah
uh
kind
of
a
de
lusting
the
supplies
are
basically
the
same
right
basically
although
raven
feathers
tend
to
breed
a
little
more
discontent
than
canary
let
me
just
get
some
things
okay
mmhmm
that'll
be
1580
for
the
lot
thanks
so
did
you
find
a
spell
book
forget
the
book
i
just
got
a
better
idea
oh
look
at
that
every
time
cuts
to
the
left
see
and
it's
not
the
carpet
it's
me
i
swear
i
would
sell
my
soul
for
a
decent
short
game
of
course
it's
a
little
late
for
that
i
don't
suppose
i
could
offer
your
soul
huh
really
help
me
on
the
green
i'm
just
funning
so
we
have
a
spike
problem
do
we
he's
been
spotted
back
in
town
and
there
was
an
incident
at
a
magic
shop
in
broad
daylight
well
yes
y'know
he
was
up
to
all
sorts
of
shenanigans
last
year
we
had
a
world
of
fun
trying
to
guess
what
he'd
do
next
i
remember
but
i
guess
we're
past
that
now
this
year
is
too
important
to
let
a
loose
cannon
rock
the
boat
should
i
have
mr
trick
send
a
committee
to
deal
with
this
loose
cannon
rock
the
boat
is
that
a
mixed
metaphor
uh
boats
did
have
cannons
and
a
loose
one
would
cause
it
to
rock
oh
honestly
i
don't
know
where
my
mind
goes
these
days
why
don't
you
take
care
of
that
spike
problem
a
committee
like
you
said
as
good
as
done
that's
swell
fore
hey
college
huh
higher
education
kind
of
an
intense
proposition
where
do
you
wanna
go
i
have
no
idea
my
mom
was
the
one
that
got
all
these
she's
so
excited
she
can't
stop
talking
about
it
i
had
a
really
hard
time
coming
up
with
an
alibi
so
i
could
come
over
here
she
doesn't
know
about
me
big
no
she's
having
enough
trouble
dealing
with
the
slayer
issue
i
don't
think
she's
ready
to
process
the
information
that
you
and
i
are
friends
again
anyway
i
think
this
college
jones
is
just
a
reaction
to
the
whole
slayer
thing
she
wants
you
to
get
out
someplace
a
little
less
hellmouthy
she
has
a
point
y'know
but
there
are
reasons
to
stay
too
what
are
they
um
you
know
there's
my
slayer
duties
obviously
what
do
you
think
i
should
do
as
a
friend
i
i
think
that
you
should
leave
this
is
a
good
opportunity
for
you
yeah
it's
not
like
there's
any
great
thing
keeping
me
here
thanks
for
the
advice
it's
another
perspective
to
consider
where
are
you
going
you
just
got
here
it's
early
yeah
well
my
mom
starts
worrying
a
lot
earlier
these
days
whoa
it
smells
like
church
in
here
no
wait
evil
church
it's
just
chemistry
stuff
an
experiment
so
you
said
when
you
called
why
do
i
have
to
be
here
it'll
help
you
on
the
exam
you're
way
behind
but
that's
why
you
love
me
right
academically
dangerous
here
hold
this
a
feather
and
who
will
i
be
tickling
shush
okay
bring
mixture
to
a
boil
i
assume
this
isn't
going
to
make
us
late
for
our
evening
of
bowling
magic
there's
no
magic
i
mean
bowling
yeah
cordelia
and
oz
are
gonna
meet
us
here
later
can
we
turn
these
lights
on
is
that
a
spell
book
no
no
no
chemistry
book
wait
a
minute
this
is
love
spell
stuff
you're
doing
a
love
spell
no
of
course
not
this
is
a
purely
scientific
delusting
spell
for
us
i
thought
it
would
go
better
if
you
didn't
know
are
you
nuts
or
have
you
forgotten
that
i
tend
to
have
bad
luck
with
these
sorts
of
spells
but
you
said
you
wished
that
these
feelings
could
just
go
away
yeah
i
wish
for
a
lot
of
things
i
told
you
i
wished
i
was
a
fireman
when
we
were
in
sixth
grade
but
you
didn't
follow
through
on
that
i
can't
do
this
anymore
xander
i
mean
this
whole
'us'
thing
is
bleagh
so
do
you
really
need
to
resort
to
the
black
arts
to
keep
our
hormones
in
check
at
this
point
i'm
thinking
'no'
i'm
gonna
get
the
lights
clean
this
place
up
before
they
get
here
and
start
asking
questions
xander
i
need
to
borrow
the
little
girl
you
don't
mind
do
you
threatening
me
that's
not
nice
we're
all
gonna
be
very
best
friends
xander
a
spell
for
me
you're
gonna
do
a
spell
for
me
uh
what
kind
of
spell
a
love
spell
are
you
brain
dead
i'm
gonna
get
what's
mine
what's
mine
teach
her
to
walk
out
on
me
what
are
you
staring
at
nothing
you
can
do
it
right
you
can
make
dru
love
me
again
make
her
crawl
ii
can
try
what
are
you
talking
about
trying
you'll
do
it
yes
i'll
do
it
you
lie
to
me
and
i'll
shove
this
through
your
face
you
want
that
no
right
through
to
your
brain
no
please
no
she
wouldn't
even
kill
me
she
just
left
she
didn't
even
care
enough
to
cut
off
my
head
or
set
me
on
fire
i
mean
is
that
too
much
to
ask
you
know
some
little
sign
that
she
cared
it
was
that
truce
with
buffy
that
did
it
dru
said
i'd
gone
soft
wasn't
demon
enough
for
the
likes
of
her
and
i
told
her
it
didn't
mean
anything
i
was
thinking
of
her
the
whole
time
but
she
didn't
care
so
we
got
to
brazil
and
she
was
she
was
just
different
i
gave
her
everything
beautiful
jewels
beautiful
dresses
with
beautiful
girls
in
them
but
nothing
made
her
happy
and
she
would
fliiirt
i
caught
her
on
a
park
bench
making
out
with
a
chaos
demon
she
only
did
it
to
hurt
me
so
i
said
'i'm
not
putting
up
with
this
anymore'
and
she
said
'fine'
and
i
said
'yeah
i've
got
an
unlife
you
know'
and
then
she
said
she
said
we
could
still
be
friends
god
i'm
so
unhappy
there
there
i
mean
friends
how
could
she
be
so
cruel
mmm
that
smell
your
neck
i
haven't
had
a
woman
in
weeks
whoa
no
hold
it
well
unless
you
count
that
shopkeeper
now
now
hold
on
ii'll
do
your
spell
for
you
and
and
and
i'll
get
you
drusilla
back
but
but
there
will
be
no
bottleinface
and
there
will
be
no
'having'
of
any
kind
with
me
alright
get
started
now
i'm
not
a
real
witch
you
know
ii
don't
know
if
this
is
gonna
work
right
away
well
if
at
first
you
don't
succeed
i'll
kill
him
and
you
try
again
this
isn't
enough
what
well
there
are
other
ingredients
aand
aaa
book
i
need
a
a
spell
book
this
isn't
it
you've
got
one
though
at
home
not
at
home
i
left
it
somewhere
where
thank
god
you
are
here
yeah
not
all
of
us
have
dates
tonight
something's
up
we
were
supposed
to
meet
in
here
i
don't
know
what
could
have
happened
what
is
all
this
stuff
i'm
thinking
weird
science
was
willow
messing
with
her
magic
tricks
again
maybe
they
disappeared
maybe
she
turned
xander
into
something
ishy
whatever
happened
there
was
obviously
a
fight
i
don't
see
any
blood
yeah
either
they
were
taken
or
they
ran
or
maybe
you're
having
too
many
ors
pick
one
i
don't
know
i
need
you
guys
to
find
giles
okay
i'm
gonna
look
for
them
maybe
they
didn't
get
too
far
where
is
giles
uh
he's
at
a
retreat
in
the
clearing
in
breaker's
woods
yeah
i
know
the

that
you're
not
even
a
loser
anymore
you're
a
shell
of
a
loser
yeah
you're
one
to
talk
meaning
the
last
time
i
looked
in
on
you
two
you
were
fighting
to
the
death
now
you're
back
making
googlyeyes
at
each
other
like
nothing
happened
makes
me
want
to
heave
i
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about
oh
yeah
you're
just
friends
that's
right
you're
not
friends
you'll
never
be
friends
you'll
be
in
love
till
it
kills
you
both
you'll
fight
and
you'll
shag
and
you'll
hate
each
other
till
it
makes
you
quiver
but
you'll
never
be
friends
love
isn't
brains
children
it's
blood
blood
screaming
inside
you
to
work
its
will
i
may
be
love's
bitch
but
at
least
i'm
man
enough
to
admit
it
hmm
eye
of
rat
xander
are
you
okay
dizzy
kind
of
nauseous
too
do
i
remember
having
a
fight
with
spike
you
do
i
won
right
kicked
his
ass
you
were
real
brave
do
you
need
to
barf
no
i'll
be
okay
where
are
we
the
factory
we're
locked
in
the
basement
that
burntout
place
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
so
we're
pretty
much
in
a
'scream
all
you
want'
scenario
pretty
much
why
didn't
he
just
kill
us
hehe
wants
me
to
do
a
love
spell
what
drusilla
broke
up
with
him
gee
and
we
had
all
hoped
those
crazy
kids
would
make
it
work
he's
out
of
control
i
mean
not
that
he
was
joe
restraint
in
the
old
days
so
what
are
our
options
well
i
figure
either
i
refuse
to
do
the
spell
and
he
kills
us
or
i
do
the
spell
and
he
kills
us
give
me
a
third
option
he's
so
drunk
he
forgets
about
us
and
we
starve
to
death
will
we're
not
gonna
die
if
he's
so
drunk
he'll
get
sloppy
and
then
i'll
make
my
move
as
long
as
my
move
doesn't
involve
standing
up
or
using
my
limbs
we'll
be
okay
we're
not
supposed
to
exemption
for
impending
death
situation

cordy
please
hold
on
xander
i
can't
see
you
cordy
he
created
all
things
in
order
that
they
might
exist
and
the
generative
forces
of
this
world
are
wholesome
and
there
is
no
destructive
poison
in
them
for
the
dominion
of
hades
is
not
on
earth
for
righteousness
is
immortal

gonna
be
okay
she
lost
a
lot

vitals
were
punctured
