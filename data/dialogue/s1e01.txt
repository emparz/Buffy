that
gym
was
full
of
vampi
asbestos
buffy

any
other
school
they
might
say
'watch

step'

hey
hey
you
forgot
your
stake
it's
estimated
that
about
25
million
people
died
in
that
one
fouryear
span
but
the
fun
part
of
the
black
plague
is
that
it
originated
in
europe
how
as
an
early
form
of
germ
warfare
if
you'll
look
at
the
map
on
page
63
you
can
trace
the
spread
of
the
disease
into
rome
and
then
north
thanks
and
this
popular
plague
led
to
what
social
changes
steve
hi
i'm
cordelia
i'm
buffy
if
you're
looking
for
a
textbook
of
your
very
own
there's
probably
a
few
in
the
library
oh
great
thanks
where
would
that
be
i'll
show
you
come
on
so
you're
from
hemery

live
in
la
that
close
to
that
many
shoes
well
you'll
be
okay
here
if
you
hang
with
me
and
mine
you'll
be
accepted
in
no
time
of
course
we
do
have
to
test
your
coolness
factor
you're
from
la
so
you
can
skip
the
written
but
let's
see
vamp
nail
polish
um
over
so
over
james
spader
he
needs
to

softer
side

it
out
no
wonder
you're
such
a
guy
magnet
are
you
done
oh
you
wanna
fit
in
here
the
first
rule
is
know
your
losers
once
you
can
identify
them
all
by
sight
they're
a
lot
easier
to
avoid
and
if
you're
not
too
swamped
with
catching
up
you
should
come
by
the
bronze
tonight
the
who
the
bronze
it's
the
only
club
worth
going
to
around
here
they
let
anybody
in
but
it's
still
the
scene
it's
in
the
bad
part
of
town
where's
that
about
a
half
a
block
from
the
good
part
of
town
we
don't
have
a
whole
lot
of

mr
giles
the
librarian

was
told
you

coming
great
so
um
i'm
gonna
need
'perspectives
on
20th
century'
giles
i
know
what
you're
after
that's
not
what
i'm
looking
for
are
you
sure
i'm
way
sure
my
mistake
so
what
is
it
you
said
the
new
kid
she
seems
kind
of
weird
to
me
what
kind
of
name
is
buffy
hey
aphrodisia
oh
hey
well
the
chatter
in
the
caf
is
that
she
got
kicked
out
and
that's
why
her
mom
had
to
get
a
new
job
neg
pos
she
was
starting
fights
negly
well
i
heard
from
blue
and
she
said
that
uh
hi
willow

why
ii
mean
hi
uh
did
you
want
me
to
move
why
don't
we
start
with
'hi
i'm
buffy'
and
uh
then
let's
segue
directly
into
me
asking
you
for
a
favor
it
doesn't
involve
moving
but
it
does
involve
hanging
out
with
me
for
a
while
but
aren't
you
hanging
out
with
cordelia
i
can't
do
both
not
legally

i
really
wanna
get
by
here

cordelia's
been
really
nice
to
me
anyway

i
kinda
have
this
burning
desire
not
to
flunk
all
my
classes

i
heard
a
rumor
that
you
were
the
person
to
talk
to
if
i
wanted
to
get
caught
up
oh
i
could
totally
help
you
out
uh
if
you
have
sixth
period
free
we
could
meet
in
the
library
or
not
or
we
could
meet
someplace
quieter
louder
uh
that
place
just
kinda
gives
me
the
wiggins
oh
it
has
that
effect
on
most
kids
i
love
it
though
it's
a
great
collection
and
the
new
librarian
is
really
cool
he's
new
yeah
he
just
started
he
was
a
curator
at
some
british
museum
or
or
the
british
museum
i'm
not
sure
but
he
knows
everything
and
he
brought
all
these
historical

sitch
sorry

about
the
dead

'cause
it's
the
weirdest
thing
he's
got
two
little
little
holes
in
his
neck
and
all
his
blood's
been
drained
isn't
that
bizarre
aren't
you
just
going
ooo
i
was
afraid
of
this
well
i
wasn't
it's
my
first
day
i
was
afraid
that
i
was
gonna
be
behind
in
all
my
classes
that
i
wouldn't
make
any
friends
that
i
would
have
last
month's
hair
i
didn't
think
there'd
be
vampires
on
campus
and
i
don't
care
then
why
are
you
here
to
tell
you
that
i
don't
care
which
i
don't
and
have
now
told
you
so
bye
is
he
wwill
he
rise
again
who
the
boy
no
he's
just
dead
can
you
be
sure
to
make
you
a
vampire
they
have
to
suck
your
blood
and
then
you
have
to
suck
their
blood
it's
like
a
whole
big
sucking
thing
mostly
they're
just
gonna
kill
you
why
am
i
still
talking
to
you
you
really
have
no
idea
what's
going
on
do
you
you
think
it's
coincidence
your
being
here
that
boy
was
just
the
beginning
oh
why
can't
you
people
just
leave
me
alone
because
you
are
the
slayer
into
each
generation
a
slayer
is
born
one
girl
in
all
the
world
a
chosen
one
one
born
with
the
strength
and
skill
to
hunt
the
vampires
with
the
strength
and
skill
to
hunt
the
vampires
to
stop
the
spread
of
their
evil
blah
blah
blah
i've
heard
it
okay
i
really
don't
understand
this
attitude
you
you've
accepted
your
duty
you
you've
slain
vampires
before
yeah
and
i've
both
been
there
and
done
that
and
i'm
moving
on
what
do
you
know
about
this
town
it's
two
hours
on
the
freeway
from
neiman
marcus
dig
a
bit
in
the
history
of
this
place
you'll
find
a
a
steady
stream
of
fairly
odd
occurrences
now
i
believe
this
whole
area
is
a
center
of
mystical
energy
that
things
gravitate
towards
it
that
that
that
you
might
not
find
elsewhere
like
vampires
like
zombies
werewolves
incubi
succubi
everything
you've
ever
dreaded
was
under
your
bed
but
told
yourself
couldn't
be
by
the
light
of
day
they're
all
real
what
you
like
sent
away
for
the
timelife
series
ah
wwwyes
did
you
get
the
free
phone
um
the
calendar
cool
but
okay
first
of
all
i'm
a
vampire
slayer
and
secondly
i'm
retired
hey
i
know
why
don't
you
kill
'em
ii'm
a
watcher
ii
haven't
the
skill
oh
come
on
stake
through
the
heart
a
little
sunlight
it's
like
falling
off
a
log
a
a
slayer
slays
a
watcher
watches
yes
no
he
he
trains
her
he
he
he
prepares
her
prepares
me
for
what
for
getting
kicked
out
of
school
for
losing
all
of
my
friends
for
having
to
spend
all
of
my
time
fighting
for
my
life
and
never
getting
to
tell
anyone
because
i
might
endanger
them
go
ahead
prepare
me
damn
what
it's
getting
worse
what's
getting
worse
the
influx
of
the
undead
the
supernatural
occurrences
it's
been
building
for
years
there's
a
reason
why
you're
here
and
a
reason
why
it's
now
because
now

the
time

oh
i
just
want
to
believe
can
you
hear
me
can
you
see
me
what's
inside
of
me
oh
i
just
want
to
believe
if
my
life
can
have
a
purpose
help
me
to
believe
everybody
wants
to
find
the
circle
the
line
of
truth
that
has
no
end
because
so
many
nights
i've
slept
with
the
feeling
of
empty
and
i
say
right
now
i'm
ready
to
believe
hey
oh
hi
hi
oh
you're
here
with
someone
no
i'm
just
here
i
thought
xander
was
gonna
show
up
oh
are
you
guys
going
out
no
we're
just
friends
we
used
to
go
out
but
we
broke
up
how
come
he
stole
my
barbie
oh
we
were
five
oh
iii
don't
actually
date
a
whole
lot
lately
why
not
well
when
i'm
with
a
boy
i
like
it's
hard
for
me
to
say
anything
cool
or
or
witty
or
at
all
ii
can
usually
make
a
few
vowel
sounds
and
then
i
have
to
go
away
it's
not
that
bad
no
iit
is
i
think
boys
are
more
interested
in
a
girl
who
can
talk
you
really
haven't
been
dating
lately
it's
probably
easy
for
you
yeah
real
easy
ii
mean
you
don't
seem
too
shy
well
my
philosophy
do
you
wanna
hear
my
philosophy
yeah
i
do
life
is
short
life
is
short
not
original
i'll
grant
you
but
it's
true
you
know
why
waste
time
being
all
shy
and
worrying
about
some
guy
and
if
he's
gonna
laugh
at
you
seize
the
moment
'cause
tomorrow
you
might
be
dead
oh
that's
nice
um
i'll
be
back
in
a
minute
oh
thathat's
okay
you
don't
have
to
come
back
i'll
be
back
in
a
minute
seize
the
moment
i
feel
love
with
my
friends
i
feel
love
in
my
songs
if
i
could
just
hold
love
then
all
the
answers
might
come
i
said
oh
if
we're
all
children
of
god
and
we
just
turned
away
i
got
a
lack
of
belief
i
said
a
world
without
faith
it's
time
we
turn
back
around
so
you
like
to
party
with
the
students
isn't
that
kinda
skanky
oh
right
this
is
me
having
fun
watching
clown
hair
prance
about
is
hardly
my
idea
of
a
party
i'd
much
rather
be
at
home
with
a
cup
of
bovril
and
a
good
book
you
need
a
personality
stat
this
is
a
perfect
breeding
ground
for
vampire
activity
it's
dark
it's
crowded
besides
i
knew
you
were
likely
to
show
up
and
i
have
to
make
you
understand
that
the
harvest
is
coming
i
know
your
friend
told
me
what
did
you
say
the
harvest
that
mean
something
to
you
'cause
i'm
drawing
a
blank
i'm
not
sure
uh
wwho
told
you
this
this
guy
dark
gorgeous
in
an
annoying
sort
of
way
i
figured
you
two
were
buds
no
the
harvest
did
he
say
anything
else
something
about
the
mouth
of
hell
i
really
didn't
like
him
look
at
them
throwing
themselves
about
completely
unaware
of
the
danger
that
surrounds
them
lucky
them
or
perhaps
you're
right
perhaps
there
is
no
trouble
coming
the
signs
could
be
wrong
it's
not
as
though
you've
been
having
the
nightmares
my
mom
doesn't
even
get
out
of
bed
anymore
and
the
doctor
says
it's
epsteinbarr
i'm
like
pleeease
it's
chronic
hepatitis
or
at
least
chronic
fatigue
syndrome
i
mean
nobody
cool
has
epsteinbarr
anymore
hey
cordelia
oh
yay
it's
my
stalker
hey
you
uh
you
look
great
well
i'm
glad
we
had
this
little
chat
listen
uh
you
know
you
wanna
dance
you
know
with
you
well
uh
yeah
well
uh
no
c'mon
guys
fine
plenty
of
other
fish
in
the
sea
oh
yeah
i'm
on
the
prowl
witness
me
prowling
i
didn't
say
i'd
never
slay
another
vampire
it's
not
like
i
have
all
these
fluffy
bunny
feelings
for
them
i'm
just
not
gonna
get
way
extracurricular
with
it
you
know
if
i
see
one
sure
i'll
will
you
be
ready
there's
so
much
you
don't
know
about
them
about
your
own
powers
a
vampire
appears
to
be
completely
normal
until
the
feed
is
upon
them
only
then
do
they
reveal
their
true
demonic
visage
you're
like
a
textbook
with
arms
i
know
this
the
point
is
a
slayer
should
be
able
to
see
them
anyway
without
looking
without
thinking
can
you
tell
me
if
there's
a
vampire
in
this
building
maybe
you
should
know
even
through
this
mass
and
this
din
you
should
be
able
to
sense
them
well
try
reach
out
with
your
mind
you
have
to
hone
your
senses
focus
until
the
energy
washes
over
you
until
you
you
feel
every
particle
oof
there's
one
wwhere
right
there
talking
to
that
girl
you
don't
know
oh
please
look
at
his
jacket
he's
got
the
sleeves
rolled
up
and
the
shirt
deal
with
that
outfit
for
a
moment
it's
dated
it's
carbon
dated
trust
me
only
someone
living
underground
for
ten
years
would
think
that
was
still
the
look
but
you
didn't
hone
oh
no
isn't
that
willow
what's
she
doing
seizing
the
moment
we're
formed
in
liquid
pushed
out
still
dripping
a
world
was
thrown
before
my
eyes
now
paint
a
picture

bluehaired
