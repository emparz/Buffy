from
beneath

screaming
that
was
you
there
was
a
girl
that
would
be
me
uh
no
it
was
just
a
dream
it
was
just
a
dream
right
from
beneath
you
it
devours
that's
what
she
said
and
then
they
there's
more
like
her
dawn
out
there
somewhere
and
they're
gonna
die
no
no
no
no
no
no
now
is
not
the
time
you
know
it
i
know
it
but
making
them
understand
is
a
totally
different
matter
no
manners
is
the
problem
proper
breeding
lack
of
etiquette
all
of
it
lacking
all
of
it
lost
on
them
not
the
time
not
hardly
ready
stop
please
mum
begging
now
make
it
stop
oh
god
ooh
aaahhhh
could
you
die
'cause
seriously
speaking
for
everybody
who
are
me
in
the
car
right
now
we're
very
excited
well
i'm
glad
for
all
of
you
then
i
mean
it's
just
so
cool
you're
coming
to
school
with
me
you'll
be
like
there
the
whole
time
you
understand
you
cannot
talk
to
me
look
at
me
or
hang
out
with
any
of
my
friends
right
look
i
doubt
we'll
be
seeing
each
other
assuming
i
even
halfunderstand
my
fuzzy
job
description
it's
not
fuzzy
you're
what
dealing
with
troubled
kids
at
a
spanking
new
hellmouth
high
please
outside
of
drugs
and
violence
and
the
unwanted
pregnancy
and
uh
unleashing
of
hordes
of
armageddon
that
comes
pouring
out
of
the
school's
foundation
every
now
and
then
what
trouble
could
these
kids
have
guess
i'll
find
out
those
kids
are
damn
lucky
having
a
slayer
and
a
friend
on
campus
there
for
'em
i
hope
they
appreciate
it
i
know
i
did
days
gone
by
huh
i
thought
you
hated
sunnydale
yes
and
no
with
an
emphasis
on
the
yes
but
at
least
then
i
was
dating
you
could
be
dating
now
yeah
um
i
don't
know
what's
not
clicking
for
me
right
now
well
there's
that
thing
with
anya
that
leaving
her
at
the
altar
thing
yeah
that
one
that's
not
something
you
bounce
right
back
from
sure
it
is
she
bounced
back
to
being
a
vengeance
demon
and
i
bounced
back
to
being
a
dateless
nerd
do
you
guys
talk
at
all
i've
seen
her
at
the
bronze
a
couple
of
times
i
guess
there's
a
lot
of
scorned
women
there
making
vengeance
wishes
on
their
exes
i
know
that's
where
i
go
to
get
my
scorn
on
you
guys
need
to
really
to
ease
up
with
the
whole
dating
demons
thing
uh
hello
i'm
sorry
wasn't
that
you
having
the
smoochathon
with
teen
vampire
last
halloween
see
this
is
why
i
don't
want
you
talking
to
my
friends
oh
we'll
sort
of
feel
our
way
around
some
students
will
be
sent
to
you
and
others
i'm
hoping
will
start
to
come
in
on
their
own
what
if
they
don't
should
i
panic
you'll
be
surprised
buffy
you're
the
youngest
and
uh
least
stuffy
member
of
this
faculty
i
think
the
students
are
gonna
want
to
come
in
and
talk
to
you
and
when
they
do
don't
evaluate
them
just
listen
they
need
to
feel
like
there's
someone
around
here
who
actually
understands
them
can
i
give
detention
ok
by
me
a
little
authority
can
be
a
wonderful
thing
just
remember
that
while
you
are
here
to
help
you're
not
here
to
be
their
friend
trust
me
you
open
that
door
and
these
students
will
eat
you
alive
you
heard
about
principal
flutie
right
hmm
forget
it
ok
then
and
buffy
relax
there's
only
three
things
these
kids
understand
the
boot
the
bat
and
the
bastinada
it's
the
it's
a
it's
a
bad
joke
it's
the
bastinada
no
one
ever
knows
what
that
thing
is
wooden
rod
to
slap
the
soles
of
the
feet
in
turkish
prisons
but
if
made
with
the
correct
wood
makes
an
awesome
billy
club
i
think
you're
gonna
fit
in
just
fine
is
there
something
else
um
yeah
uh
just
one
more
thing
i
was
uh
just
curious
you
know
uh—not
that
i'm
not
grateful
or
anything
but
uh
i
guess
i
was
wondering
why
i—
have
this
job
i
still
haven't
finished
college
i
know
was
it
my
sparkling
personality
or
maybe
you
enjoyed
my
work
at
the
doublemeat
palace
i'm
a
vegetarian
these
students
need
someone
around
here
who
understands
them
and
i
need
someone
who
understands
these
students
why
is
there
something
about
you
that
i
don't
know
that
maybe
i
should
nothing
i
can
think
of
oh
if
you'll
excuse
me
first
catch
of
the
day
i'll
be
in
my
office
if
you
need
me
thanks
i'm
just
gonna
have
a
look
around
get
to
know
the
place
make
sure
it's
all
schoollike
spike
spike
the
taxi's
here
i
know
and
in
keeping
with
a
quaint
old
birtish
tradition
you
would
now
be
expected
to
get
into
it
i
don't
know
if
i
can
giles
i'm
not
done
here
that's
your
fear
talking
yes
and
my
fear's
a
big
obnoxious
blabbermouth
you're
the
one
that
keeps
telling
me
to
trust
my
instincts
true
so
shouldn't
we
be
listening
i
don't
want
to
go
back
home
just
so
i
can
screw
up
again
i
why
don't
i
stay
not
forever
just
long
enough
to
i
don't
know
make
my
fear
shut
up
a
little
maybe
it's
possible
but
try
to
be
very
specific
what
exactly
are
you
afraid
of
well
for
starters
how
'bout
the
hellmouth's
getting
all
rumbly
again
and
now
i
know
it's
got
teeth
and
are
those
literal
teeth
'cause
i
don't
know
if
i
can
handle
it
and
what
if
i
can
handle
it
does
that
mean
i
have
to
be
a
bigger
badder
badass
than
the
source
of
all
badness
and
what
if
i
give
up
all
this
control
stuff
and
i
go
all
veiny
and
homicidal
again
and
what
if—
they
won't
take
you
back
uhhuh
willow
we
could
spend
another
two
years
here
training
and
practicing
and
learning
to
hone
your
powers
and
still
there'd
be
no
way
of
knowing
for
sure
that
the
friends
you
left
behind
you
are
still
your
friends
well
sure
i
mean
if
you
put
it
that
way
duh
i'd
love
to
offer
you
some
guarantee
that
you'd
be
welcomed
back
to
sunnydale
with
open
arms
but
i
can't
you
may
not
be
wanted
but
you
will
be
needed
that
all
you
got
for
the
moment
yes
ok
i
guess
i'd
better
trust
yourself
and
the
others
might
follow
rocky
come
on
do
your
business
so
i
can
go
home
could've
gotten
a
cat
but
no
ahh
uh
hello
and
whatever
it
was
it
was
big
and
strong
stronger
than
i
mean
i
don't
know
how
it's
possible
you
hear
thing
in
this
town
living
here
in
sunnydale
but
nobody
actually
believes
them
you
know
you'd
have
to
be
crazy
and
you
guys
think
that
i'm
crazy
don't
you
i
don't
we've
seen
things
too
nancy
and
we're
going
to
take
care
of
this
it's
your
lucky
night
considering
you
know
your
dog
just
got
all
ate
up
and
stuff
hey
can
i
freshen
up
your
tea
no
that's
ok
thanks
so
you
say
this
thing
just
came
up
out
of
the
ground
without
any
warnings
or
signs
or
anything
just
this
kind
of
rumbling
you
know
like
just
before
an
earthquake
from
beneath
you
it
devours
what
nothing
nothing
good
sounding
monsterific
all
right
should
we
round
up
the
gang
good
thinking
except
this
is
the
gang
look
nancy
we're
going
to
get
into
this
and
i
promise
you
if
your
dog
is
alive
we're
going
to
find
him
the
only
thing
that
i
need
is
a
little—
what
you
need
is
help
fortunately
you've
got
me
buffy
spike
who
is
that
he's
it's
buffy's
ex
and
i'm
thinking
it's
a
little
more
complicated
than
just
that
always
is
you've
changed
i
have
new
clothing
better
hair
not
so
much
with
the
crazy
i
like
it
now
what
do
you
want
easy
if
you
think
i
like
putting
myself
here
surrounded
by
people
who
don't
particularly
like
me
you'd
be
wrong
if
you're
uncomfortable
we
can
make
you
leave
i'll
be
quick
we
need
to
talk
want
to
do
that
here
or
privately
i'm
thinking
here
in
the
company
of
good
friends
and
pointy
weapons
you
said
something
about
quick
i
did
before
i
start
and
for
the
record
the
last
you
saw
me
i
was
a
mess—out
of
my
head
admitted
last
week
living
in
the
school
basement
well
you
saw
me
you
did
guys
just
a
second
ok
yes
i
saw
spike
i
just
didn't—
what
you
just
forgot
to
mention
it
things
were
insane
in
the
basement
i
saved
your
life
we
can
discuss
this
later
sure
whatever
you
want
right
'cause
that
seems
to
be
the
only
time
you
let
us
in
buffy
whenever
you
want
now
in
fairness
to
buffy—
shut
up
spike
ok
guys
give
us
a
second
do
not
start
by
saying
you're
sorry
i
didn't
come
here
to
atone
then
what
the
hell
do
you
want
i'm
here
to
help
you
help
me
what
i
was
hoping
you'd
tell
me
you're
the
slayer
connected
to
the
visions
long
line
of
worthies
right
i'm
just
a
guy
with
his
ear
to
the
ground
and
even
i
can
feel
it
something's
coming
i
don't
know
what
exactly
but
something's
brewing
and
it's
so
big
ugly
and
damned
it
makes
you
and
me
look
like
little
bitty
puzzle
pieces
i
mean
if
i'm
wrong
say
so
lovely
no
hard
feelings
i'll
go
out
that
door
and
you
can
lock
it
behind
me
with
any
spell
you
like
so
am
i
wrong
everything
about
you
is
wrong
spike
but
something
is
coming
you're
gonna
need
some
help
since
when
did
you
become
the
champion
of
the
people
i
didn't
i'm
just
a
guy
who
can
lend
a
hand
if
you'll
let
me
ball's
in
your
court
slayer
ok
we're
gonna
split
two
pairs
whatever
this
creature
is
it's
burrowing
through
solid
ground
that
means
a
strength
and
power
that
we
don't
usually
deal
with
but
we
may
have
to
get
used
to
now
that
the
hellmouth
is
getting
all
perky
shouldn't
we
call
the
police
or
something
and
tell
them
i'll
stop
interrupting
xander
take
nancy
home
drive
don't
walk
and
try
not
to
stop
'til
you
get
there
is
your
girlfriend
always
this
commanding
who
buffy
oh
no
no
no
no
no
see
uh
i
mean
she's
a
girl
and
she's
a
friend
but
she's
not
my
girlfriend
xander
a
little
drool
spike
and
i
will
check
out
the
scene
ok
in
the
biggest
way
i
am
not
loving
this
plan
i
am
not
loving
spike
he
tried
to
rape
you
and
he
failed
i
know
i
can
take
him
xander
take
nancy
home
spike
and
i
will
patrol
i'm
command
central
so
everybody
check
in
with
me
ok
i'll
be
here
doing
my
homework
but
the
other
one
sounded
cooler
be
safe
let's
go
rightyo
then
spike
you
sleep
right
you
vampires
you
sleep
yeah
what's
your
point
niblet
well
i
can't
take
you
in
a
fight
or
anything
even
with
a
chip
in
your
head
but
you
do
sleep
if
you
hurt
my
sister
at
all
touch
her
you're
gonna
wake
up
on
fire
you're
awfully
quiet
wouldn't
know
what
to
say
fine
with
me
i
was
more
halfexpecting
to
get
an
earful
anyway
and
when
exactly
did
your
sister
get
unbelievably
scary
what
are
you
doing
what
i
told
you
once
straight
up
i'm
here
to
help
and
that's
all
think
this
here
is
our
spot
how'd
you
guess
i
don't
fancy
sticking
my
head
in
there
well
if
something
bites
it
off
that'd
be
a
clue
so
what
happened
to
you
when
you
saw
me
those
ghostly
types
in
the
school
basement
got
in
my
head
made
me
flatout
bugshaggin'
crazy
and
i'm
not
exactly
braggin'
about
it
but
they
were
stronger
than
i
was
made
me
see
things
do
things
and
how
come
you
never
told
anyone
that
you
saw
me
i
don't
know
i
guess
i
was
partly
hoping
you
were
some
kind
of
mirage
sorry
to
disappoint
not
your
fault
hold
the
torch
would
you
look
this
us
working
together—it's
not
a
way
for
us
to
get
back
together
if
that's
what
you
want
it's
not
look
i
can't
blame
you
for
being
all
skittish
skittish
that's
not
a
word
i
would
use
for
it
you
tried
to
rape
me
i
don't
have
the
words
neither
do
i
i
can't
say
sorry
can't
use
forgive
me
all
i
can
say
is
buffy
i've
changed
i
believe
you
well
that's
something
i
just
don't
know
what
you've
changed
into
you
come
back
to
town
you
make
with
the
big
surprises
twice
i
don't
know
what
your
game
is
spike
but
i
know
there's
something
you're
not
telling
me
you're
right
there
is
but
we're
not
best
friends
anymore
so
too
bad
for
me
i'm
not
sharing
we've
been
through
things
the
end
of
the
world
and
back
i
can
be
useful
'cause
honestly
i've
got
nothing
better
to
do
make
use
of
me
if
you
want
nd
there's
nothing
here
just
a
bit
of
slime
mounds
of
displaced
dirt
and
such
whatever
our
beastie
is
he's
gone
boy
i
still
can't
believe
this
is
happening
i
mean
even
with
this
town's
reputation
for
you
know
unexplained
weirdness
right
sunnydale
come
for
the
food
stay
for
the
dismemberment
there's
good
food
well
thanks
and
that's
a
couple
of
levels
of
lameness
right
there
me
saying
thanks
after
everything
you've
done
for
me
tonight
well
you
could
slip
me
a
twenty
but
then
i'd
have
to
act
all
offended
got
it
so
um
you
think
i
might
instead
give
you
a
call
sometime
just
to
check
in
no
actually
i'm
hitting
on
you
even
better
i'm
very
listed
and
i'm
really
pushy
so
that
works
out
well
then
good
night
uh
nancy
i
just
got
a
swell
idea
run
you
ok
i
just
dumb
question
are
you
injured
are
you
hurt
i
don't
think
so
i
just—i
don't
think
i
can
take
any
more
of
this
two
attacks
in
the
same
night
i'm
starting
to
think
it's
not
coincidence
oh
sure
why
not
a
monster
trying
to
kill
me
it's
just
the
thing
that
was
missing
to
make
my
life
absolutely
perfect
uhh
ronnie
would
love
this
boy
right
who's
ronnie
oh
um
only
my
psycho
exboyfriend
that
i've
been
trying
to
get
rid
of
for
the
past
few
weeks
i
almost
prefer
the
monster
ronnie
was
um
trouble
uhhuh
and
i'm
just
curious
was
this
ronnie
guy
a
borrowing
money
kind
of
trouble
or
was
he
a
raising
demon
trouble
kind
of
guy
ronnie
he
couldn't
he
just
he
was
an
abusive
bastard
is
the
catchy
headline
and
he'd
just
show
up
even
after
you
know
the
feeling
that
you
get
when
your
ex
is
constantly
ruining
every
part
of
your
life
and
it
just
doesn't
stop
yes
and
you
get
so
tired
of
feeling
helpless
that
all
you
can
do
is
just
wish
that
it
would
stop
wish
and
it's
not
the
fact
that
he
cheated
it's
the
way
he
cheated
you
know
i
mean
we
could
have

thinking
of
you
holding
myself
and
spilling
useless
buckets
of
salt
over
your
ending
angel—he
should've
warned
me
he
makes
a
good
show
of
forgetting
but

here
in
me
all
the
time
the
spark
i
wanted
to
give
you
what
you
deserve
and
i
got
it
they
put
the
spark
in
me
and
now
all
it
does
is
burn
your
soul
bit
worse
for
lack
of
use
you
got
your
soul
back
how
it's
what
you
wanted
right
it's
what
you
wanted
right
and—and
now
everybody's
in
here
talking
everything
i
dideveryone
i—
and
him
and
it
the
other
the
thing
beneath—beneath
you
it's
here
too
everybody
they
all
just
tell
me
go
go
to
hell
why
why
would
you
do
that—
buffy
shame
on
you
why
does
a
man
do
what
he
mustn't
for
her
to
be
hers
to
be
the
kind
of
man
who
would
nev—
to
be
a
kind
of
man
she
shall
look
on
him
with
forgiveness
and
everybody
will
forgive
and
love
he
will
be
loved
so
