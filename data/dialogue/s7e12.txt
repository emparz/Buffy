two
are
dead
why
'cause
the
black
chick
always
gets
it
first
ow
what
was
that
rona
i'm
dead
because
he's
a
vampire
i
don't
have
slayer
strength

do
you
think
i
care
about
a
fair
fight
no
no
sir
you
don't
play
by
the
rules
and
i
have
learned
a
valuable
lesson
of
some
sort
ow
ok
spike
you're
right
you
don't
have
slayer
strength
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
you're
not
strong
you
have
inherent
abilities
that
others
do
not
have
not
like
you
do
no
not
yet
but
it's
there
you
have
the
potential
you
have
strength
speed
instinct
you
just
have
to
learn
to
trust
yourself
rona
what
did
your
instincts
tell
you
to
do
just
then
block
his
attack
keep
him
off
balance
gain
the
advantage
no
they
didn't
they
told
me
to
run
vi
they
told
me
to
run
they're
still
sort
of
telling
me
to
run
don't
fight
on
his
terms
your
gut's
telling
them
to
run
run
ok
regain
the
higher
ground
make
the
fight
your
own
spike
what
did
your
instincts
tell
you
to
do
just
then
hunt
kill
come
at
me
full
speed
he
needs
to
kill
to
live
that
tells
you
everything
you
need
to
know
instinct
understand
his
but
trust
yours
you
were
chosen
for
a
reason
are
you
ok
i'm
fine
couple
of
ribs
ain't
quite
set
right
since—
i'm
fine
lemme
see
no
it's
just—
spike
i'm
gonna
be
ok
that's
hot
so
we're
supposed
to
like
make
out
with
them
or
something
careful
buffy
just
when
you
think
it's
part
of
the
lesson
he'll
hurt
your
arm
molly
kennedy
let's
go
you're
up
next
lesson
no
way
one
armed
pushups
are
bull
i
can
do
'em
i
can
do
the
kinda
way
you
clap
between
i'm
more
of
a
chin
up
kinda
girl
i
can
do
chinups
'til
the
cows
come
home
you're
saying
demon
and
i
don't
mean
to
oh
bananas
imagine
yourself
covered
in
human
viscera
you're
all
gonna
die
but
you
knew
that
already
'cause
that's
the
cool
reward
for
being
human
big
dessert
at
the
end
of
the
meal
don't
kid
yourselves
you
guys
this
whole
thing
is
all
about
death
you
think
you're
different
'cause
you
might
be
the
next
slayer
death
is
what
a
slayer
breathes
what
a
slayer
dreams
about
when
she
sleeps
death
is
what
a
slayer
lives
my
death
could
make
you
the
next
slayer
oh
goody
rapt
attention
i
love
that
so
much
now
where
was
i
ah
if
we
go
with
what
anya's
resources
are
telling
us
then
the
first
is
in
remission
for
a
while
which
we
think
means
advantage
us
well
what
does
that
mean
about
the
first
as
best
we
can
tell
he—or
precisely
it—was
putting
a
lot
of
stock
in
that
ubervamp
thing
the
chaka
khan
turokhan
so
when
i
kicked
its
ass
the
whole
firsty
circus
decided
to
back
off
for
a
while
good
news
means
we
probably
don't
have
to
worry
about
it
pulling
spike's
strings
for
a
while
here's
the
halfempty
time
away
means
time
to
regroup
and
part
of
that
regrouping
is
coming
back
stronger
than
ever
the
odds
are
against
us
time
is
against
us
and
some
of
us
will
die
in
this
battle
decide
now
that
it's
not
going
to
be
you
i
know
you're
all
tired
far
away
from
home
anxious
but
you're
all
special
most
people
in
this
world
have
no
idea
why
they're
here
or
what
they
want
to
do
you
do
you
have
a
mission
a
reason
for
being
here
you're
not
here
by
chance
you're
here
because
you
are
the
chosen
ones
dawn
you
better
hurry
up
and
eat
something
so
you're
not
late
for
school
xander
i
know
i'm
sorry—if
you're
gonna
take
a
shower
at
my
house
lock
the
door
of
course
they're
curious
hey
i
gotta
go
uh
has
giles
checked
in
yet
i
thought
he
was
picking
up
that
chaoahn
girl
in
shanghai
yesterday
ok
well
uh
let
me
know
if
he
does
bye
amanda
right
i'm
all
yours
do
people
ever
think
you're
weird
um
i
guess
sure
in
a
charming
endearing
loveable
yeah
i
feel
like
people
think
i'm
weird
and
so
they
pick
on
me
but
i
might
be—weird
amanda
why
do
you
think
that
you're
weird
one
of
the
boys
who
picks
on
me
i
kind
of—see
if
a
guy
picks
on
you
is
it
weird
to
think
he's
cute
oh
it's
just
the
last
few
times
i've
seen
him
i've
wanted
to
you
know
pick
on
himextra
more
uhhuh
the
thing
is
i
can't
tell
my
mom
says
when
a
guy
teases
you
it
means
he
likes
you
sometimes
that's
true
is
it
weird
we're
mean
to
each
other
and
we
like
each
other
well
it
depends
sometimes
that's
how
people
relate
being
mean
to
each
other
even
mortal
enemies—
then
with
the—
and
that
leads
to
no
good
absolutely
no
good
and
much
confusion
aand
then
it's
over
absolutely
seriously
definitely
over
and
that's
confusing
too
the
over
part
which
it
is
over
so
maybe
there
might
be
an
appropriate
place
to
do
that
like
maybe
outside
why
do
we
always
have
to
yell
i
was
only
gone
a
couple
of
hours
buffy
oh
look
everybody
it's
willow
perhaps
with
a
blunt
weapon
of
some
sort
buffy
we
just
got
news
and
she's
sure
positive
althenea
said
the
seers
located
another
potential
slayer
here
in
sunnydale
someone
that
already
lives
here
oh
god
all
these
girls
flocking
to
town
and
this
one's
already
here
and
under
our
noses
wait
the
seers
couldn't
find
out
her
name
or
like
her
address
or
anything
am
i
getting
the
definition
of
seer
wrong
i
was
gonna
take
the
girls
out
tonight
a
little
show
and
tell
but
maybe
now
i
shouldn't
they
were
so
excited
you're
gonna
break
their
little
hearts
this
town
is
lousy
with
bringers
i
don't
want
to
risk
that
they
find
this
new
girl
first
no
you
should
go
i
can
do
a
spell
to
find
her
tonight
i
just
have
to
get
together
a
few
ingredients
but
youyou
shouldn't
skip
your
training
it's
too
important
you
think
you
can
handle
it
no
problemo
yeah
and
you
guys
have
more
important
things
to
do
ok
i'll
take
'em
yes
andrew
you're
not
going
ooh
crossbow
got
to
love
it
feels
like
i'm
storming
a
castle
you
do
a
lot
of
that
do
you
i
might
i
had
a
beauty
like
this
halt
ok
see
that's
why
we
don't
point
the
weapons
in
the
kitchen
it's
not
loaded
that's
always
the
lead
quote
under
the
headline
household
crossbow
accident
claims
teen
oh
a
mace
yeah
that's
better
gotta
go
with
the
stake
it's
classic
i
like
the
feel
of
wood
in
my
hand
lost
me
there
hey
we
gearing
up
already
oh
right
you
guys
are
going
on
your
little
group
patrol
more
than
that
it's
an
outing
i'm
thinking
tonight
we
might
actually
get
to
kill
things
ii've
killed
things
sometimes
i'm
not
begging
you're
like
a
small
dog
dancing
for
snausages
you
don't
want
me
coming
along
'cause
you
think
i'm
evil
he
doesn't
seem
evil
exactly
he's
not
evil
but
when
he
gets
close
to
it
he
picks
up
its
flavor
like
a
mushroom
or
something
but
i'm
reformed
i'm
like
vegeta
on
dragonball
z
i
used
to
be
a
pure
sayan
and
now
i
fight
for
the
side
of
goku
still
not
coming
it's
not
fair
spike
just
killed
people
and
he
gets
to
go
spike
didn't
have
free
will
and
you
did
i
hate
my
free
will
this
is
where
you're
all
hiding
you
ready
to
go
or
what
let's
go
girls
grab
your
weapons
all
right
let's
do
it
i
don't
know
about
you
guys
but
i'm
ready
to
kick
some
serious
you
wanna
play
dragonball
z
ok
i
got
my
tumbleweed
my
eggsgot
my
chrysalises—chrysali
my
butterfly
transformer
pods
hey
whwhere's
my
snakeskin
at
your
ssssservice
miss
rosenberg
ssssir
can
you
imagine
if
every
once
in
a
while
people
just
wriggled
out
of
their
skin
and
left
it
behind
them
like—like
on
the
sidewalk
talk
about
embarrassing
hey
do
you
think
this
girl
this
potential
goes
to
sunnydale
hmm
well
i
guess
probably
huh
i
mean
she's
got
to
be
about
that
age
could
be
anybody
could
be
that
glamazon
in
gym
class
what's
her
name
oh
my
lab
partner
margot
the
freak
boy
i
hope
not
because
she
totally
fainted
right
in
the
middle
of
our
fetal
pig
dissection
somehow
i
just
don't
think
she's
cut
out
for
the
slayage
biz
killing
pigs
is
just
so
wrong
and
also
hard
well
we'll
know
soon
enough
who
the
next
potential
is
somebody's
life
is
about
to
change
how
long
will
it
take
will
we
find
out
who
it
is
right
away
pretty
much
the
spell
will
conjure
up
this
brilliant
light
aand
the
light
will
find
the
potential
and
it'll
illuminate
her
with
a
glowing
aura
cool
i've
enchanted
this
map
so
we
can
track
her
basic
location
we'll
have
to
hotfoot
it
but
i'm
betting
we
find
her
tonight
you
know
if
it
is
margot
she's
so
gonna
faint
to
light
the
aura
of
the
new
skin
of
snake
and
chrysalis
too
oh
good
god
what
is
that
smell
i'm
fairly
sure
that's
the
smell
of
a
hardboiled
egg
being
thrown
into
a
fire
uhhuh
the
smell
will
lead
us
to
the
potential
or
some
poor
soul
who
ate
too
many
chimichangas
she'll
also
be
lit
with
a
brilliant
aura
is
it
supposed
to
be
shimmying
all
over
like
that
i
don't
know
i
don't
think
so
so
you
messed
up
the
spell
again
at
least
it
smells
you
know
otherworldly
oh
look
pretty
i
suck
i'm
sorry
you
guys
i—
maybe
we
could
figure
something
out
on
the
computer
good
call
i'm
gonna
open
the
door
and
let
this
place
air
out
don't
worry
will
it's
really
no
big
i
just—i
was
sure
that
it
was
gonna
work
dawn
i
think
it
worked
dawn
dawn
are
you
ok
maybe
yyou
did
it
wrong
was
it
aambiguous
in
any
way
did
you
maybe
say
potential
sailors
'cause
ii
do
like
the
water
i
did
it
right
wow
she—you're
a
potential
you
could
be
the
next
slayer
whoa
wow
it's
like
one
second
you
were
this
klutzy
teenager
with
fake
memories
and
a
history
of
kleptomania
and
then—then
suddenly
you're
a
hero
a
hero
with
a
much
abbreviated
lifespan
this
is
huge
we
have
to
think
about
this
ii
can't
think
about
this
it
doesn't
fit
in
my
head
a
slayer
makes
sense
i
guess
remember
that
thing
about
they
share
the
same
blood
or
whatever
yeah
i
never
got
that
she
has
to
die
i
mean
if
i
was
ever
the
slayer
it
would
mean
she
died
well
it's
a
lot
like
being
the
pope
in
that
way
except
you
don't
have
to
be
some
old
catholic
i've
got
to
call
buffy
she's
gonna
be
so
excited
no
we
can't
she
didn't
bring
a
cell
phone
well
sure
'cause
all
the
important
people
are
with
her
you
are
important
now
whwhawhat
happens
now
well
you
could
start
by
maybe
sitting
still
for
a
sec
ii
cant
ii
need
to
know
what
happens
to
my
life
well
i
guess
buffy
trains
you
right
i
train
with
the
potentials—other
potentials
learn
to
do
the
stuff
they're
learning
right
we
also
have
to
protect
you
from
the
uh
eyeless
guys
the
ones
with
the
sharp
sharp
knives
bringers
it's
ok
we'll
protect
you
what
if
they
saw
the
spell
saw
the
spell
dawn
they
can't
see
flashcards
big
ones
we
did
a
big
orange
powerful
spell
what
if
they
sensed
it
what
if
they're
on
their
way
are
we
gonna
replace
the
microwave
'cause
i
was
thinking
some
orville
redenbacher
with
fresh
butter
flavor—
what's
going
on
dawn's
gonna
be
a
slayer
holy
crap
excuse
me
plucked
from
an
ordinary
life
handed
a
destiny—
say
skywalker
and
i
smack
ya
does
buffy
know
she
didn't
take
her
phone
incommunicado
well
we'll
tell
her
soon
as
she
gets
back
let's
not
what
dawn
she
has
to
know
ii
know
just
not
right
away
guys
when
mom
appeared
to
me
she
said—
dawnie
no
please
she
said
something
about
buffy
and
i'm
thinking
i'm
just
not
so
sure
buffy
will
be
happy
for
me
of
course
she
will
will
she
i
mean
i'm
not
even
sure
i'm
happy
for
me
everything's
different
for
me
now
that's
because
you're
a
part
of
something
larger
like
being
swallowed
by
something
larger
thisthis
is
too
much
for
my
head
again
i
can't
i—i
need
to
be—
nice
job
with
the
getting
swallowed
analogy
well
it
is
a
mixed
bag
you
know
if
she
gets
to
be
the
slayer
then
her
life
is
short
and
brutal
and
if
she
doesn't
then
it
smells
of
unfulfilled
potential
my
swallowed
analogy
looks
pretty
sweet
right
now
doesn't
it
it's
not
like
that
it's
like
she's
part
of
this
huge
power
i
know
what
that
feels
like
it
feels
wonderful
yes
willow
so
captured
it
it's
like—well
it's
almost
like
this
metaphor
for
womanhood
isn't
it
the
sort
of
flowering
that
happens
when
a
girl
realizes
that
she's
part
of
a
fertile
heritage
stretching
back
to
eve
and—
i'll
pay
you
to
talk
about
star
wars
again
this
isn't
about
womany
power
this
is
about
the
fact
that
dawn
just
might
have
bought
herself
an
early
death
we
don't
know
that
right
all
we
know
is
that
everything
just
changed
someone
should
go
find
buffy
i
still
think
she
needs
to
know
hey
will
what
if
she
doesn't
like
it
are
you
worried
about
what
dawn
said
about
the
ghost
xander
we
don't
even
know
if
that
really
was
joyce
and
we
don't
know
what
she
meant
about
buffy
i'm
not
talking
about
that
i
mean
what
do
you
think
buffy's
going
to
do
with
this
information
jump
up
and
down
teach
dawn
the
secret
handshake
she
know
what
this
means
short
brutal
life
sharp
sharp
knives
i
covered
this
right
you
think
buffy
really
wants
that
for
dawn
and
besides
dawn
doesn't
want
us
telling
her
yet
dawn's
freaking
out
her
input—not
worth
that
much
right
now
she's
a
child
of
course
she
can't
handle
this
hey
something
out
there
says
she
can
handle
this
and
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
something
out
there
chose
her
i'm
chosen
sure
she
can
handle
it
is
that
why
she's
hiding
out
in
her
room
right
now
she's
just
getting
used
to
it
let
it
happen
she
doesn't
have
to
rush
he's
right
we
shouldn't
rush
her
rushing's
only
gonna
get
her
killed
this
is
a
bar
best
damn
field
trip
i
ever
took
look
they're
all—
they're
demons
it's
a
demon
bar
it's
like
a
gay
bar
only
with
demons
spike
long
time
nice
of
you
to
bring
snacks
thouch
them
and
lose
your
privates
i
didn't
like
him
nice
job
of
blending
in
girls
we're
a
bunch
of
15
year
olds
in
a
demon
bar
how
much
blending
did
you

human
blood

body

'cause

wring
some
information

a
room
full
of
friends
who

yeah
you
all
right
sure
just
walking
you
know
aare
you
all
right
you've
got
a
thing
i
guess
i—
i
had
a
bit
of
a—
it's
been
a
bizarre
night
what
happened
who
did
that
to
you
uh
nobodyexactly
i
don't
think
you'd
exactly
believe
me
try
me
ii
was
at
school
late
because
of
you
know
swing
choir
and
i
tore
my
sweater
you
know
the
striped
ones
we
wear
so
i
went
to
home
sciences
to
sew
it
up
uhhuh
and
by
the
time
i
was
finished
the
place
was
empty
so
it
was
all
echoy
and
lonely
and
then
there
was
this
guy—or
thing
and
it
was—it
scratched
me
and
i
kinda
dodged
it
and
it
kinda
hit
its
head
what
kind
of
thing
i
don't
know
it
was
messed
up
in
the
face
'round
here
abouts
and
when
it
scratched
at
you
did
it—was
it
scratching
with
its
teeth
is
it
real
was
it
really
a
vampire
i
bet
you
think
i'm
crazy
i—i
believe
you
well
cool
the
thing
is
after
it
hit
its
head
i
kinda
freaked
out
i
trapped
it
in
a
room
and
it's
still
there
and
now
i
don't
know
what
to
do
it's
ok
this
is
totally
dealable
don't
worry
well
i
was
thinking
of
getting
your
sister
you
know
something
about
my
sister
well
i've
heard
people
talking
a
lot
of
'em
think
she's
some
kind
of
highfunctioning
schizophrenic
but
i
also
heard
that
maybe—like
maybe
she
could
help
with
this
kind
of
thing
do
you
think
we
should
go
get
her
she's
out
i'll
take
this
one
whew
i
think
i
strained
something
maybe
something
i'll
need
later
in
life
uh…
come
on
the
vampire's
upstairs
are
you
spooked
out
no
i'm
all
right
ii
can
do
this
it's
mostly
instinct
i
think
so
if
he
scratched
me
with
a
tooth
am
i—i'm
not
gonna
turn
into
one
am
i
uh
only
if
he
slashed
open
one
of
his
own
veins
and
led
you
to
drink
deep
of
his
blood
nope
good
you're
lucky
he
didn't
hurt
you
way
more
than
that
right
he
can
do
that
so
i
was
thinking
we
don't
have
to
kill
the
vampire
do
we
what
just
suppose
he
got
out
and
was
maybe
like
encouraged
toward
the
gym
while
the
marching
band
was
playing
because
the
way
they
look
down
on
the
swing
choir
it
might
be
you
know
funny
i'm
just
saying
well
he
didn't
break
down
the
door
anyway
yeah
can
they
do
that
they're
very
strong
and
although
they
feel
pain
they
don't
hold
back
because
of
it
guess
you're
some
kind
of
monster
expert
too
let's
just
say
it
runs
in
the
family
i
thought
you
said
it
was
locked
it
was
it
was
here
amanda
it
got
out
where'd
it
go
i
dunno
but
we
have
to
get
out
of
here
what
are
you
doing
i
can't
remember
does
it
have
to
be
upside
down
or
right
side
up
to
work
which
is
it
a
vampire
is
an
animal
sometimes
they
run
in
packs
sometimes
alone
who
can
tell
us
where
we
are
it's
a
nest
how
can
you
tell
only
a
vamp
could
live
like
this
some
yeah
as
a
group
we're
not
known
for
our
tasteful
decor
but
in
all
fairness
to
the
race
this
place
is
seriously
lacking
in
style
thank
you
spike
i'm
merely
saying
he
has
a
point
vampires
can
live
anywhere
any
way
they
want
taste
fashions
living
conditions—they
can
vary
the
animal
inside
always
the
same
where'd
you
live
what
you
mean
before
a
crypt
actually
but
nicer
a
bit
more—i
don't
know
if
posh
is
the
right
word
but
it
was
more
like—
comfy
excuse
me
when
did
you
find
it
comfy
moving
on
you
want
to
stay
alive
you
have
to
spot
and
identify
a
nest
on
site
look
around
all
of
you
look
for
signs
that
just
last
night
maybe
a
dozen
two
dozen
vampires
were
right
where
we're
standing
go
ahead
work
work
work
this
little
excursion
was
just
in
danger
of
being
interesting
you
know
what
spike—
interesting
is
not
a
problem
buffy
i
think
we
found
something
it's
a
body
it's
not
a
body
it's
leftovers
in
here
help
we
need
to
barricade
this
too
small
too
big
stay
down
think
we're
safe
no
one's
safe
not
here
not
ever
see
this
guy
bbut
he
was
dead
a
minute
ago
that
was
a
minute
ago
now
hey
he's
the
enemy
amanda
yes
listen
i'm
listening
we're
gonna
get
out
of
this
both
of
us
alive
alive
you
believe
me
i
believe
you
good
'cause
i
got
a
plan
you
can't
think
too
much
reacting's
better
could
be
the
difference
between
staying
alive
and
that
other
thing
ok
this
plan
of
mine
i'm
not
guaranteeing
it'll
work
better
than
mine
about
him
eating
the
marching
band
besides
your
plan'll
work
in
case
you
haven't
noticed
i
don't
know
what
i'm
doing
here
you're
getting
it
done
the
question
is
never
what
do
you
think
it's
always
what
do
you
know
you
gotta
know
it
if
you
don't
if
you
make
one
mistake
40a
int
classroom

buffy
help
amanda
help
me
i
can't
amanda
no
you
don't
want
her
you
want
me
amanda
what
were
those
amanda
listen
to
me
remember
when
you
said
i
was
special
well
i'm
not
but
the
thing
is
you
are
this
is
your
battle
amanda
no
i
can't
you
can
you've
got
to
look
i've
got
your
back
but
this
is
something
you
have
to
do
it's
something
you
were
born
to
do
here
this
belongs
to
you
buffy
up
here
here
ok
one
minute
i'm
in
swing
choir
and
the
next—
what
the
hell's
going
on
you
tell
me
to
come
to
you
with
problems
turns
out
a
vampire
attacked
me
problem
so
i
go
to
your
house
and
when
i
get
there
this
orange
cloud
hits
me
she
was
at
the
doorway
and
i
don't
know
if
you're
into
the
drugs
but
that's
not
my
deal
all
right
that
cloud
hit
me
and
i
got
a
little
dizzy
and
discombobulated
it
was
willow's
spell
she's
the
potential
slayer
i'm
sure
the
vampire
thought
we
were
like
what
four
helpless
girls
and
then
vi—vi
actually
yells
we're
just
four
helpless
girls
that
was
part
of
my
plan
when
it
all
started
going
down
it
was
like
we
knew
what
we
were
doing
for
real
yeah
like
when
you
dodged
that
first
attack
and
then
cracked
him
across
the
jaw
aw
no
no
no
no
no
see
i
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
do
that
if
you
hadn't've
pulled
his
legs
out
i
hurt
his
arm
yep
and
an
arm
can
be
as
lethal
as
a
mouth
when
you
staked
him
seriously
the
rush
was
like—
so
you
took
one
out
solo
yeah
what
was
that
like
i
don't
know
i
mean
when
i
saw
the
vampire
vamp—
vampire's
good
too
cool
yeah
when
that
vampire
attacked
me
i
felt
this
kind
of
charge
you
know
like
you
realize
in
one
instant
that
your
whole
life
is
different
exactly
it's
that
rush
you're
talking
about
hey
you
ok
yeah
i
was
thinking
of
hitting
the
books
do
some
research
on
the
first
it's
in
retreat
mode
right
now
but
you're
still
gonna
need
to
know
how
to
fight
it
great
sounds
good
hey
you
guys
wanna
head
downstairs
get
our
newest
arrival
up
to
speed
what's
up
aw
i'm
just
thinking
about
the
girls
it's
a
harsh
gig
being
a
potential
just
being
picked
out
of
a
crowd
danger
destiny
plus
if
you
act
now
death
they
can
handle
it
yeah
they're
special
no
doubt
the
amazing
thing
is
not
one
of
them
will
ever
know
not
even
buffy
know
what
how
much
harder
it
is
for
the
rest
of
us
no
way
they've
got—
seven
years
dawn
working
with
the
slayer
seeing
my
friends
get
more
and
more
powerful
a
witch
a
demon
hell
i
could
fit
oz
in
my
shaving
kit
but
come
a
full
moon
he
had
a
wolfy
mojo
not
to
be
messed
with
powerful
all
of
them
and
i'm
the
guy
who
fixes
the
windows
well
you
had
that
sexy
army
training
for
a
while
and—and
the
windows
really
did
need
fixing
i
saw
what
you
did
last
night
yeah
i—
i
guess
i
kinda
lost
my
head
when
i
thought
i
was
the
slayer
you
thought
you
were
all
special
miss
sunnydale
2003
and
the
minute
you
found
out
you
weren't
you
handed
the
crown
to
amanda
without
a
moment's
pause
you
gave
her
your
power
the
power
wasn't
mine
they'll
never
know
how
tough
it
is
dawnie
to
be
the
one
who
isn't
chosen
to
live
so
near
to
the
spotlight
and
never
step
in
it
but
i
know
i
see
more
than
anybody
realizes
because
nobody's
watching
me
i
saw
you
last
night
i
see
you
working
here
today
you're
not
special
you're
extraordinary
maybe
that's
your
power
what
seeing
knowing
maybe
it
is
maybe
i
should
get
a
cape
cape
is
good
yeah
