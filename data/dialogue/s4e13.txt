i
implore
you
neisa
blessed
goddess
of
chance
and
fortune
heed
my
call
send
to
me
the
heart
i
desire
the
camera
is
pulling
back
slowly
and
we
see
she
is
holding
five
cards
you
know
magic
at
the
poker
table
qualifies
as
cheating
that
wasn't
magic
i
was
praying
two
please
five
xander
ahn
i
keep
telling
you
four's
the
max
and
only
if
you
have
an
ace
okay
four
let's
see
the
ace
three
what
a
stupid
game
all
these
rules
just
to
win
little
plastic
disks
chips
they're
called
chips
they
represent
money
since
none
of
us
has
any
money
it
represents
money
but
that's
gonna
change
once
my
merchandise
hits
the
street
hmm
wha'cha
got
in
the
boxes
drugs
it's
not
drugs
is
it
xander
not
drugs
you
are
looking
at
the
new
local
distributor
for
boost
bars
'the
natural
food
bar
that
provides
a
nutritional
energy
boost
for
active
healthconscience
people'
want
one
no
thanks
those
things
usually
taste
kind
of
tasteless
and
then
leave
a
bad
aftertastelessness
well
don't
let
the
healthy
scare
you
check
out
these
ingredients
see
loaded
with
fatty
goodness
come
on
somebody
bet
already
i
got
three
'k'
cards
wish
the
buff
could've
made
it
this
threehand
poker
is
not
quite
the
game
guess
she's
out
with
riley
you
know
how
it
is
with
a
spanking
new
boyfriend
yes
we've
enjoyed
spanking
well

the
thing
is
i
think
riley
is
okay
in
an
oafish
kind
of
way
but
am
i
the
only
one
with
a
big
floating
question
mark
over
his
head
about
this
initiative
thing
well
they
do
seem
to
fall
into
the
'good
guy'
camp
i
mean
they
are
antidemon
probably
pro
exdemon
maybe
i
choose
to
feel
threatened
and
why
not
there's
still
heaps
we
don't
know
about
these
commandos
what
exactly
are
they
up
to
lights
the
brights
of
a
humvee
parked
up
on
a
gradual
hill
illuminates
the
area
and
buffy
and
the
lead
commando
turn
to
see
professor
maggie
walsh
in
a
dark
wool
coat
hurrying
down
to
them
she
walks
past
the
lead
commando
who
his
pulling
off
his
mask
and
we
see
it's
riley
finn
walsh
stands
in
front
of
buffy
and
regards
her
with
a
stoic
expression
it
took
the
patrol
team
42
minutes
to
track
you
and
you
neutralized
them
in
28
seconds
i
was
just
lucky
i
see
well
still
very
impressive
i
was
just
being
modest
with
the
whole
'lucky'
thing
you
got
that
right
i
got
it
awesome
buffy
pfft
see
you're
a
hit
everybody
loves
you
so
then
professor
walsh
said
that
i
was
just
as
amazing
as
riley
had
said
and
later
he
told
me
that
she
couldn't
stop
talking
about
this
move
i
made
where
i
used
one
of
the
commandos
as
a
shield
to
block
a
taser
blast
it
was
like
twelvethousand
volts
it
took
the
guy
almost
two
hours
to
recover
huh
hmm
how
was
your
night
like
a
normal
person's
light
on
the
actionpack
hope
tonight's
not
too
much
of
a
letdown
for
you
excitementwise
you
do
remember
about
tonight
right
bronze
the
gang
are
you
kidding
i
wouldn't
be
anywhere
else
i
miss
you
guys
we
haven't
been
able
to
spend
that
much
time
together
lately
you've
been
busy
fighting
armies
and
stuff
not
to
mention
other
distractions
from
a
romantic
riley
just
walked
in
willow
looks
over
her
shoulder
and
we
see
riley
at
the
lunch
counter
perusing
the
fruit
bowl
do
ya
want
to
let
him
know
you're
here
no
just
enjoying
a
good
stare
tell
me
about
your
night
well
spent
most
of
it
at
xander's
teaching
anya
to
play
poker
that
sounds
like
fun
yeah
except
the
anya
part
and
the
poker
part
will
i
think
you
better
get
used
to
a
twinkie
that's
his
lunch
oh
he
is
so
gonna
be
punished
everyone's
getting
spanked
but
me
what
uh
nothing
hey
wipe
your
feet
when
you
enter
a
person's
home
oh
yes
careless
of
me
tracking
mud
all
over
your
uh
mud
i
admit
it's
a
bit
of
a
fixerupper
needs
a
woman's
touch
care
to
have
a
crack
at
it
while
i'd
loved
to
go
on
trading
jabs
with
you
spike
perhaps
i'll
come
to
the
point
as
much
as
it
pains
me
to
say
it
um
i
owe
you
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
the
help
you
provided
me
in
my
recent
metamorphosis
stuff
the
gratitude
you
owe
me
more
than
that
mate
threehundred
count
it
if
you'd
like
i'll
do
that
um
thinking
about
your
affliction
and
uh
your
newfound
discovery
that
you
can
fight
only
demons
it
occurs
to
me
that
i
realize
this
is
completely
against
your
nature
but
iii
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
there
may
be
a
higher
purpose
ugh
you
made
me
lose
count
what
are
you
still
doing
here
talking
to
myself
apparently
well
piss
off
then
this
bit
of
business
wraps
up
any
i
got
with
you
and
your
slayerettes
from
here
on
i
want
nothing
to
do
with
the
lot
of
you
your
choosing
to
remain
in
sunnydale
might
make
that
a
little
difficult
well
you
and
yours
will
just
have
to
show
a
little
restraint
is
all
get
out
and
i
don't
want
you
crawling
back
here
knocking
on
my
door
pleading
for
help
the
second
teen
witch's
magic
goes
all
wonky
or
little
xander
cuts
a
new
tooth
we're
through
you
got
it
honeymoon
is
over
you
don't
have
to
do
this
i
know
i
mean
if
you'd
rather
wait

i'm
ready
i
want
to
new
retinal
scan
recorded
summers
buffy
my
god
you
said
it
was
big
you
told
me
but
you
never
said
it
was
huuuge
i
don't
like
to
brag
i
had
no
idea
this
is
incredible
but
not
that
i
thought
it
was
some
flybynight
operation
unless
it
is
i
mean
can
you
guys
fly
at
night
with
those
jetpack
things
do
you
have
those
i
can't
really
talk
about
it
this
is
unreal
so
you
like
our
little
operation
yeah
yes
it's
very
clean
your
visitor's
pass
and
i've
assembled
some
reading
material
to
bring
you
up
to
speed
oh
and
i
thought
i
was
never
gonna
get
homework
from
you
again
you
can't
take
that
home
that's
classified
material
highly
sensitive
when
you're
through
reading
those
pages
you'll
have
to
eat
them
she's
joking
don't
worry
it
doesn't
happen
very
often
shall
we
much
of
our
handson
research
with
the
shts
is
performed
here
we
call
this
'the
pit'
buffy
sees
a
pair
of
green
squidfaced
demons
laying
on
two
tables
while
scrubclad
techs
work
on
them
and
what
do
you
call
those
tough
it
took
eight
of
us
to
bring
those
two
down
they'll
be
under
our
control
soon
enough
doctor
angleman
head
of
our
science
team
he's
a
leader
in
the
field
of
xenomorphic
behavior
modification
behavior
modification
we've
made
significant
advances
in
reconditioning
the
subterrestrials
bringing
them
to
a
point
where
they
no
longer
pose
a
threat
so
i've
seen
on
the
discovery
channel
with
gorillas
and
sharks
theythey
made
them
all
nice
you
haven't
seen
it
what's
over
there
the
armory
you'll
have
to
be
cleared
for
use
on
each
of
these
weapons
but
by
this
point
buffy
must
have
felt
like
she
was
back
in
class
for
her
attention
has
already
wandered
and
she
steps
up
to
a
table
behind
walsh
and
riley
she
sees
a
small
looking
device
laying
in
an
open
case
as
she
lifts
it
up
the
image
on
the
monitor
behind
her
also
moves
and
we
see
a
closeup
of
buffy's
eye
as
she
holds
the
device
close
to
her
face
the
more
advance
arsenal
can
be
complicated
but
i'm
certain
in
time
you'll
pick
that
up
don't
pick
that
up
what
is
it
about
twentythousand
dollars
it's
a
prototype
for
a
comcam
communications
camera
soon
to
be
standard
issue
gives
us
a
direct
comlink
to
control
when
we're
out
in
the
field
also
monitors
the
heart
rate
of
the
wearer
a
valuable
tool
for
research
in
stress
in
combat
condition
if
you'll
follow
me
i'll
show
you
the
sht
containment
area
we
have
a
few
more
things
to
give
you
what's
in
there
quick
shot
of
the
metal
security
door
we
saw
in
the
last
episode
a
lab
coat
scientist
uses
a
id
card
to
open
the
door
and
disappears
inside
research
area
very
restricted
for
security
reasons
here
is
your
security
card
and
your
pager
been
thinking
about
getting
one
of
these
we're
the
only
ones
with
the
number
and
it
stays
that
way
right
lose
either
one
of
them
and
there's
hell
to
pay
and
down
here
we
mean
that
literally
again
welcome
to
the
team
this
is
so
cool
wow
i've
been
trying
to
find
the
dollseye
crystal
my
entire
life
well
since
june
anyway
where'd
you
get
it
itit
was
my
grandma's
i
think
i
found
it
a
long
time
ago
in
my
attic
ii
want
you
to
have
it
oh
no
tara
ththat's
really
sweet
i
can't
it's
like
a
family
heirloom
ii
just
wouldn't
feel
comfortable
but
iif
you
wanted
to
try
out
some
spells
with
it
some
time
i
wouldn't
say
no
maybe
tonight
i
mean
if
you're
not
doing
something
you
could
come
over
and
we
could
do
something
tonight
that
sounds
really
nice
but
tonight
i
uh
already
have
plans
with
people
other
oh
um
that's
okay
another
time
absolutely
it's
just
tonight
itit's
kind
of
a
specific
crowd
you
might
feel
out
of
place
i
better
get
to
class
well
um
i'll
see
ya
later
okay
how
did
the
tour
go
i'm
not
sure
she's
unpredictable
she
walks
across
the
room
her
attention
is
on
something
we
cannot
see
she's
an
unnecessary
risk
possibly
how's
our
baby
doing
today
adjusting
nicely
reflexes
motorfunctions
all
off
the
charts
that's
what
i
like
to
hear
almost
time
to
wake
up
adam
cut
to
the
lab
table
we
see
a
young
man
laying
under
a
blanket
only
his
chest
and
head
visible
but
he
doesn't
look
like
a
normal
man
and
take
your
first
look
at
the
world
i
know
you're
gonna
make
me
proud
xander
you
haven't
been
paying
any
attention
to
me
tonight
just
peddling
those
process
food
breaks
i
don't
know
why
well
let
me
put
it
in
a
way
you'll
understand
sell
bars
make
money
take
anya
nice
places
buy
pretty
things
that
does
make
sense
all
right
i
support
you
go
sell
more
oh
well
this
was
the
only
one
i
had
on
me
besides
it's
getting
late
maybe
we
should
go
go
you
can't
go
buffy
hasn't
gotten
here
yet
let's
face
it
will
she's
over
an
hour
late
she's
probably
out
living
the
life
of
riley
i
don't
think
she's
coming
she
is
she
said
she
was
looking
forward
to
spending
quality
time
with
just
us
see
here
she
comes
with
riley
and
some
other
guys
hi
all
sorry
about
the
lateitude
late
really
huh
hadn't
noticed
hope
you
don't
mind
us
tagging
along
no
no
of
course
not
the
more
the
more
this
is
graham
this
is
forrest
that's
kevin
and
that's
jay
in
the
back
how
you
doing
we're
gonna
go
grab
some
drinks
anybody
want
anything
coke
please
i'm
good
no
we're
going
away
to
dance
over
there
we
are
anya
seems
a
bit
on
edge
she's
a
little
angsty
around
commandotypes
exdemon
issues
oh
you
know
i
didn't
think
that
you
would
mind
riley
and
the
guys
were
throwing
a
little
impromptu
celebration
in
my
honor
and
made
it
like
impossible
to
not
invite
them
oh
that's
neat
about
the
celebrating
i
just
thought
this
was
supposed
to
be
you
know
just
us
just
the
scooby
corps
you
know
i
mean
i
could
have
invited
somebody
else
if
i
knew
it
was
an
open
freeforall
i'm
sorry
i
had
no
idea
my
total
bad
so
who
did
you
want
to
invite
what
you
said
you
wanted
to
invite
someone
no
not
no
one
i
meant
a
hypothetical
someone
which
is
to
say
no
one
what
are
we
celebrating
i'm
in
the
initiative
professor
walsh
gave
me
the
grand
tour
and
we're
talking
grand
as
in
canyon
you'd
never
believe
the
size
of
it
that's
really
again
i
say
'neat'
so
what
do
you
mean
exactly
you've
joined
them
no
nnot
exactly
it
just
means
that
when
i
patrol
i'll
have
a
heavily
armed
team
backing
me
up
plus
boyfriend
going
to
work
with
me
big
extra
perk
buffy
do
you
really
think
this
is
a
good
idea
i
mean
don't
you
think
you're
rushing
things
a
little
i
thought
you
liked
riley
not
with
riley
with
the
initiative
i
mean
there's
a
bunch
of
stuff
about
them
we
still
don't
know
i
know
that
like
what
well
what's
their
ultimate
agenda
i
mean
okay
yeah
theythey
neuter
vampires
and
demons
but
then
what
are
they
gonna
reintegrate
them
into
society
get
them
jobs
as
bagboys
at
walmart
does
walmart
have
bagboys
plus
don't
forget
that
'314'
thing
that
ethan
told
giles
about
well
a
man
that
worships
chaos
and
tries
to
kill
you
is
a
man
you
can
trust
well
bad
info
or
not
i
just
think
there's
certain
questions
you
should
ask
before
you
go
off
and
enlist
that's
us
let's
go
when
did
you
get
a
pager
what's
going
that's
our
cue
mother
wants
us
will

i
know
talk
later
so
what's
the
big
emergency
this
is
your
objective
subt
67119
demon
class
polgara
species
though
visual
confirmation
has
not
yet
been
made
we're
confident
of
the
target's
approximate
position
as
it
leaves
behind
a
distinct
protein
marker
dr
angleman
will
brief
you
on
its
defenses
when
threatened
bone
skewers
jut
from
the
creature's
forearms
during
battle
it's
imperative
when
ensnaring
it
not
to
damage
its
arms
that's
all
you
really
need
to
know
question
buffy
why
exactly
can't
we
damage
this
polka
thing's
arms
i
uh
not
that
i
want
to
it's
just
in
my
experience
when
fighting
for
your
life
body
parts
get
damaged
and
better
its
bits
than
mine
or
ours
we
wish
to
study
the
physiology
of
every
subterrestrial's
natural
defenses
it's
part
of
the
research
we
do
here
uh
yes
we
see
that
buffy
had
her
hand
raised
again
what
do
they
want
want
why
are
they
here
sacrifices
treasure
or
they
just
get
rampagy
i
find
it's
easier
to
predict
their
responses
if
i
know
they're
not
sentient
just
destructive
i
believe
they
do
have
keen
eyesight
however
you
might
want
to
be
suited
up
for
this
oh
you
mean
the
cammo
and
stuff
i
thought
about
it
but
i
mean
it's
gonna
look
all
'private
benjamin'
don't
worry
i've
patrolled
in
this
halter
many
times
why
don't
we
give
our
attention
to
dr
angleman
and
save
all
questions
until
the
end
actually
i'm
finished
oh
uh
well
agent
finn
deploy
the
teams
okay
listen
up
we'll
be
going
in
a
four
squad
setup
team
leaders
gates
taggart
and
stavros
alpha
team
you're
with
me
report
for
tls
for
assignment
and
weapons
requisitions
reminder
this
is
a
zapntrap
people
capture
not
a
kill
any
questions
buffy
willow
a
funny
thing
happened
with
my
prior
social
engagement
pretty
much
ended
when
a
friend
of
mine
went
off
to
do
something
with
another
crowd
she
hangs
out
with
irony
is
kind
of
ironic
that
way
anyway
i
know
it's
late
but
ii
thought
maybe
i
mean
if
you
still
wanted
to
do
something
so
i
guess
she
hates
me
now
what
professor
walsh
questions
an
initiative
faux
pas
yes
it's
a
little
unusual
she's
just
not
used
to
it
maybe
because
you
barely
ever
opened
your
mouth
in
her
classroom
but
i
know
she
likes
you
in
fact
she
liked
you
before
i
did
really
told
me
so
herself
maybe
i
should
get
her
a
present
or
something
buffy
can
we
talk
about
this
later
there's
a
dangerous
hostile
out
here
and
since
i
don't
have
your
reflexes
i
kinda
need
to
focus
right
right
what
do
you
mean
she
liked
me
before
you
did
uh

you
didn't
like
me
it
just
isn't
right
he
made
you
team
leader
didn't
he
that's
not
the
point
i've
always
been
riley's
second
in
command
instead
he
picks
a
girl
his
girl
whatever
three
guesses
on
what
that
boy
is
thinking
with
maybe
he
just
wanted
to
give
you
a
chance
to
get
out
from
under
his
shadow
hey
i'm
not
under
anybody's
shadow
it
was
a
joke
man
don't
get
your
panties
in
a
bunch
i'm
just
saying
hang
on
got
something
target
negative
hello
hostile
17
you
two
standard
flanking
go
alert
control
and
alpha
team
we've
tagged
hostile
17
with
a
tracer
and
we're
in
pursuit
sir
graham's
on
the
talkie
for
you
reception's
not
too
good
this
is
alpha
team
go
ahead
we
hear
graham's
garbled
voice
but
can't
make
out
any
of
the
words
say
again
beta
team
you're
breaking
up
riley
so
what
do
you
want
to
do
now
before
he
says
anything
cut
to
riley's
room
which
becomes
now
and
riley
is
on
top
again
as
they
continue
to
make
love
the
music
is
replaced
by
a
more
sinister
theme
as
we
cut
to
a
black
and
white
ceilingshot
of
riley's
room
the
camera
pulls
back
and
we
see
we're
looking
into
a
surveillance
monitor
there
is
a
label
on
top
of
the
monitor
that
has
'finn'
written
on
it
as
the
shot
continues
to
pull
back
we
see
two
more
monitors
to
either
side
of
it
with
similar
shots
of
currently
empty
rooms
one
is
labeled
'gates'
the
other
'miller'
a
control
panel
becomes
visible
under
the
row
of
monitors
there
are
two
reels
of
tape
spinning
obviously
in
'record'
mode
and
there
is
someone
sitting
in
front
of
the
control
panel
i
don't
know
how
many
more
ways
i
can
say
'i'm
not
interested'
we
see
xander
and
anya
are
sitting
on
the
couch
in
the
living
room
area
there
are
several
boost
bar
boxes
on
the
coffee
table
w
try
one
check
these
flavors
cherryberry
maple
walnut
ooo
almond
licorice
ew
anya
we
don't
say
'ew'
in
front
of
potential
customers
just
skip
this
part
and
tell
him
you
want
money
to
buy
me
pretty
things
he'll
understand
very
well
hmm
maple
walnut
an
excellent
choice
please
leave
my
home
now
it's
the
uh
the
gritty
texture
isn't
it
maybe
you're
more
a
cherryberry
fellow
close
the
door
spike
you
may
want
to
give
up
these
morning
jogs
soldiers
boys
are
out
in
force
i've
been
trying
to
keep
them
off
my
scent
run
them
in
circles
but
they
keep
coming
and
how
is
this
our
concern
seeing
as
how
you've
expressed
the
desire
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
us
spike
said
that
mmhmm
that
hurts
all
right
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
i
need
help
and
no
cheek
from
you
look
the
buggers
shot
me
in
the
back
remind
me
why
should
i
help
you
because
you
do
that
you're
the
goodygood
guys
you're
the
bloody
freaking
cavalry
no
you
can
come
up
with
a
better
answer
than
that
why
should
i
help
you
ooh
because
i
helped
you
when
you
turned
into
that
fyarl
demon
i
helped
you
didn't
i
and
that
was
out
of
the
um
evilness
of
your
heart
oh
hell
no
i
made
you
pay
me
you
right
bastard
that's
all
that's
left
i
spent
the
rest
on
blood
and
smokes
which
i'll
never
see
again
ah
come
on
circle
the
wagons
tend
to
the
wounded
here
no
time
for
layabouts
hey
what's
the
matter
weren't
expecting
to
see
me
i
never
know
what
to
expect
your
robot
bird
sounds
hungry
it's
just
a
reminder
to
take
my
vitamins
you're
kidding
sorry
quite
the
regimental
soldier
i
am
how
they
trained
me
they
who
they
you
know
the
government
plucked
me
out
of
special
op
training
for
this
what
did
they
tell
you
it
was
for
they
didn't
in
the
military
you
learn
to
follow
orders
not
ask
questions
i
don't
understand
aren't
you
curious
about
all
the
science
and
research
stuff
they're
doing
hm
i
know
all
i
need
to
know
we're
doing
good
here
protecting
the
public
removing
the
subterrestrial
threat
it's
work
worth
doing
what's
314
riley
we
have
a
situation
you're
needed
on
my
way
what
is
it
don't
know
you're
really
not
one
for
asking
questions
are
you
i'll
leave
that
to
you
lose
your
way
agent
no
ma'am
i've
instructed
beta
team
to
suspend
pursuit
of
hostile
17
until
your
arrival
i
didn't
want
any
slipups
that's
why
i'm
putting
you
in
charge
you'll
rendezvous
with
them
at
these
coordinates
riley
make
me
proud
yes
ma'am
i
think
we've
got
a
situation
angleman
looks
up
from
his
work
and
as
he
pulls
his
mask
down
we
see
his
latexed
fingers
are
bloodied
the
slayer
she's
becoming
a
liability
we
knew
that
was
a
danger
does
she
know
about
the
project
she
knows
it
exists
she
already
holds
too
much
influence
over
riley
over
agent
finn
we
move
to
the
contingency
scenario
right
away
angleman
is
now
using
scissor
clamps
on
the
something
we
still
can't
see
that's
too
bad
she
could
have
been
a
powerful
ally
i
know
and
finn
will
take
it
hard
that's
why
sooner
is
better
we
finally
see
what
angleman
was
working
on
as
he
lifts
the
left
arm
severed
at
the
shoulder
of
the
polgara
demon
lying
on
the
table
he
moves
away
from
the
table
with
it
and
we
can
see
adam
on
a
another
table
several
feet
away
it's
better
oww
watch
it
that
hurts
it
doesn't
appear
to
be
a
bullet
it's
too
deeply
embedded
to
be
a
tranquilizer
dart
also
not
tranquil
some
sort
of
illumination
emanating
from
it
it's
blinking
i
don't
care
if
it's
playing
'rockin'
the
casbah'
on
the
bloody
jew's
harp
just
get
it
out
of
me
anya
there's
a
bottle
of
cognac
in
the
cabinet
next
to
the
sink
can
you
get
it
for
me
what
you're
gonna
get
snockered
now
it's
not
for
me
you
prat
if
i'm
gonna
operate
on
you
then
i
need
you
in
anesthetized
it's
going
to
take
some
time
we
don't
have
any
that
blinking
thing
my
pseudosoldier
memory
bank
tells
me
that's
a
tracer
a
what
a
what
it's
like
a
homing
beacon
and
if
commando
guys
are
reading
the
signal
they're
coming
home
well
we
need
to
buy
some
time
it's
in
deep
and
i'm
no
surgeon
oh
hi
hey
out
all
night
huh
you
too
yeah
sorry
about
bailing
on
you
guys
at
the
bronze
that's
okay
i

don't
worry
about
it
okay
wow
they
really
keep
you
hopping
don't
they
yeah
i
gotta
go
i'll
see
ya
hello
willow
you're
there
at
last
we
have
a
problem
where's
buffy
just
left
beeped
away
by
her
new
buds
you
want
me
to
go
after
her
uh
no
no
it's
your
help
i
need
actually
really
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
it's
a
small
job
reconnaissance
probably
a
waste
of
a
slayer's
abilities
but
my
boys
are
on
assignment
so
i
buffy
no
it's
okay
i'm
up
for
some
action
i
doubt
you'll
get
any
on
this
one
we
have
a
reading
of
a
class
three
subterrestrial
moving
through
the
sewer
tunnels
just
on
the
edge
of
town
class
three
it's
a
lowlevel
threat
minimal
aggression
meager
defenses
professor
walsh
they
barely
show
up
on
the
scanner
and
occasionally
turn
out
to
be
raccoons
wow
you're
not
crazy
about
raccoons
huh
we
always
take
precautions
all
we
need
you
to
do
is
get
a
visual
on
this
thing
this
will
feed
me
back
an
image
and
i
can
advise
you
from
there
i
don't
want
to
put
you
in
any
unnecessary
danger
oh
that's
okay
danger's
my
birthright
sorry
um
professor
walsh
there's
uh
there's
still
some
stuff
about
all
this
that
i'm
not
clear
on
well
when
you
get
back
we
can
have
a
talk
good
okay
when
i
get
back
am
i
supposed
to
salute
you
no
okay
tropo
strato
meso
aero
iono
exo

so
how
is
this
supposed
to
work
again
if
she
succeeds
her
spell
will
ionize
the
atmosphere
around
us
thereby
disrupting
the
tracer's
signal
buys
us
time
elements
are
brought
to
bear
wind
earth
and
water
churn
amidst
the
fire
let
the
air
be
burned
did
it
work
is
the
atmosphere
ionized
shot
of
our
gang
their
hair
is
standing
up
we
can't
see
spike's
hair
in
this
shot
they
glance
at
one
another
and
static
electricity
can
be
heard
doing
the
'snap
crackle
pop'
in
their
hair
i'd
venture
yes
what
do
you
mean
the
signal's
whacked
i
mean
the
blips
a
blob
some
kind
of
interference
messing
with
the
tracer
try
to
lock
it
down
we
headed
in
the
right
general
direction
i
think
so
it's
gonna
put
us
in
populated
areas
okay
then
we
change
into
civvies
and
then
move
out
maybe
something
will
turn
up
professor
walsh
are
you
getting
this
possible
sht
make
it
a
definite
and
he's
brought
along
a
friend
they
seem
talk
to
me
forrest
signal's
somewhere
in
this
neighborhood
estimate
within
a
twoblock
radius
it
feels
and
looks
like
the
ionizing
spell
is
wearing
off
giles
i've
got
it
i've
got
it
he
holds
up
the
tweezers
and
we
see
a
twoinch
dart
with
a
blinking
red
light
on
the
blunt
end
okay
we
want
to
keep
the
hostile
contained
so
no
one
is
to
make
a
move
without
my
wait
signal's
cleared
up
there
let's
go
um
go
what
it's
on
the
move
heading
straight
at
us
forty
meters
and
closing
moving
fast
in
broad
daylight
look
alive
people
weapons
at
the
ready
twentyfive
meters
twenty
fifteen
where
to
the
left
ten
meters
five
anyone
i
got
nothing
this
doesn't
make
sense
it
went
right
past
us
flushed
the
tracers
been
flushed
regret
to
report
hostile
17
is
still
at
large
i
left
beta
team
to
comb
the
area
but
the
tracer's
riley
something's
happened
ii
don't
know
what
to
say
ititit's
about
buffy
buffy
two
of
our
hostiles
broke
free
and
escaped
into
the
tunnels
she
went
after
them
on
her
own
she's
dead
riley
what
i
did
everything
i
could
to
stop
her
i
told
her
to
wait
for
a
backup
team
she
kept
insisting
she
didn't
need
any
team
she
could
handle
it
by
herself
ii'm
so
so
sorry
i
don't
understand
i
know
what
she
meant
to
you
how
could
this
happen
she
was
a
very
very
special
girl
i
didn't
understand
at
first
but
she
had
something
i
don't
know
maybe
i
could
have
stopped
her
it's
hard
not
to
blame
myself
professor
walsh
that
simple
little
recon
you
sent
me
on
wasn't
a
raccoon
turns
out
it
was
me
trapped
in
the
sewers
with
a
faulty
weapon
and
two
of
your
pet
demons
if
you
think
that's
enough
to
kill
me
you
really
don't
know
what
a
slayer
is
trust
me
when
i
say
you're
gonna
find
out
riley

agent
finn
i
order
you
to
stop
agent
finn
riley
it
will
be
dark
soon
i
think
it
will
be
wise
for
you
to
leave
sunnydale
i'm
not
going
anywhere
not
until
those
bastards
undo
whatever
they
did
to
me
put
me
back
the
way
i
was
sure
just
explain
to
the
nice
scientist
guys
that
you
really
miss
killing
and
torturing
innocent
people
do
you
think
that
would
work
spike
lord
knows
why
i'm
telling
you
this
it's
for
your
own
good
as
long
as
the
initiative
is
in
operation
it's
not
safe
for
you
here
no
it's
not
safe
for
any
of
us
cut
to
what's
behind
door
number
314
the
lab
is
dimly
lit
walsh
is
approaching
the
table
where
adam
is
still
sleeping
he
it
no
longer
has
a
sheet
covering
him
and
we
can
see
more
of
his
mismatched
demon
body
he's
wearing
commando
pants
and
boots
there
is
a
strange
metalelectronic
plate
on
his
chest
where
the
heart
would
be
so
all
right
fine
if
she
wants
a
fight
we'll
give
her
one
won't
we
adam
i've
worked
too
long
too
long
to
let
some
little
bitch
threaten
this
project
threaten
me
she
has
no
idea
who
she's
dealing
with
once
she's
gone
riley
will
come
around
he'll
understand
it's
for
the
greater
good
he'll
see
that
and
if
he
doesn't
well
first
things
first
remove
the
complication
and
when
she
least
expects
itahh
adam
walsh
falls
and
she
slides
off
the
spear
adam
raises
his
new
polgara
left
arm
and
we
see
the
blood
on
the
bone
skewer
he's
looking
down
at
walsh's
body
