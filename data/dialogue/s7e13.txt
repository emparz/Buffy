are
you
sure
you'll
all
be
all
right
you'll
only
be
gone
for
two
days
i
think
we've
managed
a
bit
longer
than
that
right
oh
dawn
vi's
left
her
notebook
on
the
mantelpiece
would
you
mind
running
it
out
to
the
car
sure
while
you're
at
it
you
smack
her
in
the
head
with
it
and
remind
her
not
to
leave
it
lying
around
on
it
i'm
just
a
bit
twitchy
about
leaving
you
alone
again
here
while—while
things
are
in
such
a
state
of
flux
i
know
but
you
should
go
this
trip
is
important
for
the
girls
to
understand
the
source
of
their
power
and
to
know
how
to
use
it
right
do
you
think
they
appreciate
the
gravity
of
what
we're
undertaking
it's
frightening
and
it's
difficult
and
then
apparently
someone
told
them
that
the
vision
quest
consists
of
me
driving
them
to
the
desert
doing
the
hokey
pokey
until
a
spooky
rastamama
slayer
arrives
and
speaks
to
them
in
riddles
that's
not
exactly
how
i
put
it
i—
hey
how's
kennedy
still
fluey
bummed
about
missing
the
field
trip
she
says
she
wants
you
to
meditate
extra
hard
for
her
and
to
bring
her
back
some
smores
ah
yes
smores
i'm
going
to
end
up
singing
campfire
songs
aren't
i
oh
yeah
giles
you
might
want
to
get
out
there
oh
god
what
molly
and
rona
are
fighting
over
who
gets
to
drive
the
first
leg
bet
you
wish
you
renewed
that
california
state
driver's
license
now
huh
rona
won
you
should
probably
let
molly
out
of
the
trunk
i
never
actually
realized
just
how
compact
molly
really
is
please
be
safe
while
i'm
away
you
too
hey
hey
giles
is
off
on
the
retreat
give
us
all
a
chance
for
a
breather
eh
from
giles
from
the
constant
pitter
patter
of
clomping
teenage
girly
feet
i
have
no
idea
what
you're
talking
about
come
on
no
i
enjoy
my
responsibility
as
mentor
role
model
life
guide—oh
my
god
i
cannot
believe
i
have
my
bathroom
all
to
myself
for
two
whole
days
it's
like
a
bloody
warzone
up
there
and
not
in
a
good
way
have
you
seen
the
kitchen
since
they've
been
here
i'm
just
trying
to
stay
out
of
their
way
i
noticed
this
is
better
believe
me
it's
safer
ok
but
you've
been
fine
in
close
contact
with
the
girls
with
you
by
my
side
yeah
you
won't
let
me
hurt
one
of
them
and
that's
the
way
it's
gonna
be
until
we're
sure
the
first
is
done
making
me
its
bitch
either
we're
together
or
i'm
on
the
leash
we
just
need
to
make
sure
the
trigger's
deactivated
then
we've
got
a
couple
of
days
lack
of
pitterpatter
and
all
buffy
what
ow
ow
ow
ow
ow
what's
wrong
spike
what
is
going
on
the
chip
god
why
would—
aaahhh
hey
how
is
he
oh
in
the
goes
part
of
comes
and
goes
well
there
seems
to
be
a
definite
lack
of
screaming
that
has
to
be
good
you'd
think
that
for
the
other
patient
yeah
thought
i'd
bring
her
some
tea
help
her
feel
better
mmhmm
it's
just
tea
will
how
much
do
you
know
about
the
chip
spike's
chip
well
i
remember
trying
to
dig
up
stuff
back
then
but
you
know
turns
out
when
a
secret
government
agency
studies
vampires
and
puts
chips
in
their
brains
that
keep
them
from
hurting
people
they
don't
really
build
websites
why
even
with
the
chip
spike
was
able
to
hurt
all
those
people
when
he
was
brainwashed
yeah
but
he
was
under
the
control
of
the
first
maybe
something's
wrong
with
it
the
chip
is
misfiring
all
on
its
own
then
well
this'll
be
fun
remember
when
things
used
to
be
nice
and
boring
no
have
fundelivering
tea
ok
not
when
you
make
it
sound
all
dirty
like
that
it's
just
tea
hey
i
figured
the
best
thing
for
a
cold
is
a
nice
hot
cup
of
boots
hey
for
someone
who's
sick
you
look
surprisingly
robust
and
casual
dressy
well
the
lighting
in
here
is
good
maybe
it's
just—
you
were
never
sick
noi
was
never
sick
oh
you
are
so
busted
xander's
gonna
have
to
drive
you
to
the
desert
and—
willow
chill
there's
a
reason
i
didn't
go
i
have
a
thing
a
separate
thing
what
something's
coming
down
i
have
my
own
mission
and
i
need
you
help
so
i
can
be
happy
again
this
is
a
mission
oh
yeah
and
the
little
pink
umbrellas
are
a
signal
for
what
we're
not
on
a
mission
are
we
hey
trust
me
i
told
you
i
have
a
thing
come
on
come
on
just
hang
out
with
me
a
little
you're
sexy
when
you
pout
why
do
you
do
that
to
get
you
to
stay
all
right
i'll
stay
for
one
drink
then
i'm
going
home
ok
one
drink
i
can
work
with
that
let's
start
with
the
easy
stuff
how
long
have
you
known
that
you're
gay
wait
that's
easy
and
you
just
assume
that
i'm—i'm
gay
i
mean
presume
much
ok
how
long
have
you
enjoyed
having
sex
with
women
hey
what
you
think
you
have
some
special
lesbidar
or
something
ok
you
know
there's
a
better
word
for
that
right
you
really
haven't
been
getting
out
there
much
have
you
well
i
just—can
you
always
tell
just—just
by
looking
at
someone
no
no
of
course
not
that
wouldn't
be
any
fun
the
fun
part
is
the
process
of—of
getting
to
know
a
girl
it's
like—it's
like
flirting
in
code
it's
using
body
language
and
laughing
at
the
right
jokes
and—and
looking
into
her
eyes
and
knowing
she's
still
whispering
to
you
even
when
she's
not
saying
a
word
and
that
sense
that
if
you
can
just
touch
her
just
once
everything
will
be
ok
for
both
of
you
that's
how
you
can
tell
or
if
she's
really
hot
you
just
get
her
drunk—see
if
she
comes
on
to
you
three
years
ago
that's
when
i
knew
and
it
wasn't
women
it
was
woman
just
one
lucky
woman
popped
another
blood
vessel
i
think
there's
gotta
be
a
reason
why
the
chip
is
going
all
wonky
maybe
it's
related
to
the
trigger
or
maybe
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
new
soul
or
maybe
i
wasn't
meant
to
last
this
long
one
more
thing
you
and
i
have
in
common
eh
pet
well
we'll
fix
it
we'll
hit
serious
research
mode—
good
try
behavioral
modification
software
throughout
the
ages
ok
you're
right
not
a
book
thing
it's
a
phone
thing
who
you
gonna
call
god
that
phrase
is
never
gonna
be
useable
again
is
it
doubt
it
do
your
parents
know
yeah
my
mom
was—was
all
proud
like
i
was
making
some
political
statement
then
the
statement
mojo
wore
off
and
i
was
just
gay
she
hardly
ever
even
met
tara
classic
i
didn't
mind
tara
and
i
are
kind
of
private
i'm
sorry
it
must've—
were
i
mean
private
yes
agent
finn
riley
tell
him
we're
having
a
problem
with
spike's
chip
no
his
chip
spike
listen
pet
no
no
finn
is
his
last
name
yeah
well
did
he
used
to
work
there
and
then
he
got
transferred
oh
is
this
actually
a
flower
shop
or
is
this
one
of
those
things
where
i'm
supposed
to
play
along
to
show
that
i
know
it's
really
secret
ops
oh
maybe
i
shouldn't
have
said
that
oh
ok
right
well
if
some
guy
named
finn
shows
up
to
buy
flowers—
yeah
thanks
wrong
number
or
a
giant
government
conspiracy
one
or
the—
spike
this
one
seemed
easier
than
the
others
see
probably
just
gonna
fade—
it
was
gone
with
the
wind
i
saw
that
and
i
knew
i
wanted
to
sweep
scarlet
off
her
feet
you
were
five
well
i'm
not
saying
the
sweeping
would
have
been
easy
what
i
just—i
still
don't
get
it
why
you
like
me
i
mean
you
don't
even
know
me
have
you
seen
you
and
we
like
the
same
things—italian
skate
punk
robert
parker
mysteries
fighting
evil
i
don't
like
any
of
that
stuff
except
the—the
fighting
evil
part
even
then
i
prefer
a
nice
foot
massage
ok
i
dig
the
way
you
always
turn
off
the
moulin
rouge
dvd
at
chapter
32
so
it
has
a
happy
ending
i
like
the
way
you
speak
it's
interesting
and
your
freckleslikeable
i'm
not
so
into
the
magic
stuff
it
seems
like
fairy
tale
crap
to
me
but
if
it
matters
to
you
you
care
about
it
so
it's
cool
well
this
is
my
stop
soglad
we
talked
yes
kinda
cleared
the
air
yeah
totally
air
cleared
check
you
know
in
the
spirit
of
air
clearing
yeah
i
feel
like
i
need
to
be
honest
about
something
iis
something
wrong
no
no
it's
just—
i
think
you
should
know
well
that
was
nice
are
you
ok
i'm
not
used
to
literally
knocking
girls
off
of
their
feet

just
the
power
of
my
own
lips
ok
you
gonna
pick
that
up

freckle
thing

hey
bad
touching
everyone
please
stop
it
it's
willow
i'm
willow
are
you
sure
there
are
other
stories
from
kindergarten
non
yellow
crayon
stories
in
which
you
don't
come
out
in
such
a
good
light
an
incident
involving
aquaman
underoos
for
example
you
want
me
to
start
talking
hey
willow
what
happened
i
don't
know
we
were
there
and
then
i
looked
like
him
oh
like
a
glamour
maybe
but
i
probably
brought
it
on
myself
what
makes
you
think
that
well
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
i
have
a
history
with
my
witchy
subconscious
making
things
go
kerfloopey
remember
the
wacky
i
can't
see
you
you
can't
see
me
spell
guys
it's
so
real
i'm
all
too
aware
ok
say
you're
right
and
you
did
do
this
to
yourself
why
would
your
subconscious
turn
you
into
warren
obviously
because
i
feel
bad—about
killing
him
we'll
deal
we'll
get
help
no
i
can
handle
this
on
your
own
why
i
did
it
i'll
fix
it
i
don't
want
you
seeing
me
this
way
anyway
it's
kinda
a
little
late
for
that
seriously
i'm
not
posing
any
big
threat
to
the
world
looks
like
you've
got
your
hands
full
already
i'll
go
i'll
handle
it
i'll
fix
it
i'll
be
back
before
you
even
know
i'm
gone
promise
spike
buffy
i'm
right
here
the
chip
fired
again
i
kinda
figured
maybe
they'll
call
back
maybe
they'll
send
help
maybe
we
can't
wait
ok
safe
to
say
no
one
will
ever
accuse
you
of
being
too
butch
kennedy
go
home
come
on
i
mean
you
turned
into
a
guy
i
mean
if
you
take
a
step
back
seriously
there's
a
certain
element
of
humor
here
right
well
a
really
really
big
step
i
killed
him
it's
hard
to
see
the
chuckles
so
you
got
a
plan
yeah
get
some
help
reversing
it
i
thought
you
were
gonna
try
it
yourself
i
did
try
something's
blocking
me
all
the
more
reason
for
me
to
go
with
you
plus
i
was
there
when
it
happened
lemme
come
to
try
to
help
too
i
really
think
i'm
fine
with
the
handling
by
yourself
why
i'm
the
one
that
killed
him
i—
it's
hard
to
understand
given
how
'bout
i
just
tag
along
anyway
keep
you
company
i'm
taking
that
as
a
yes
fine
come
try
not
to
get
in
the
way
you
know
where
you're
going
to
see
some
old
friends
of
mine
it's
been
a
while
but
maybe
they
can
help
are
you
sure
you
still
wanna
go
back
in
this
place
with
me
eh
nothing
good
on
tv
tonight
here
we
are
i
don't
know
worked
pretty
good
when
the
initiative
held
me
captive
here
every
time
i'd
get
a
littlerambunctious
the
chip'd
kick
in
i
feel
like
my
head
was
gonna
explode
they'd
dope
me
up
and
everything
would
be
all
daffodils
and
teddy
bears
for
a
couple
of
hours
anyway
maybe
we
should
search
for
files
and
stuff
find
out
everything
we
can
about
the
chip—shelf
life
i'll
take
whatever
i
can
get
ready
yeah
i'll
get
it
i'm
supposed
to
get
a
call
when
the
new
league
of
extraordinary
gentlemen
comes
in
i
gave
them
this
number
ooh
can
you
see
if
you
can
get
two
summers
residence
this
is
andrew
speaking
how
can
i
help
you
loser
hey
do
we
know
some
british
guy
named
robson
he
was
attacked
this
robson
guy
in
england
and
giles
was
there
helping
him
and
there
was
a
bringer
xander
robson
blacked
out
but
the
last
thing
he
remembers
is
giles's
head
about
to
get
really
familiar
with
a
bringer's
very
sharp
axe
oh
my
god
giles
never
mentioned
any
of
this
robson
said
by
the
time
he
came
to
there
was
no
giles
so
what
are
we
saying
maybe
giles
just
didn't
want
to
talk
about
it
or
maybe
he
didn't
make
it
look
i'm
not
saying
it's
a
happy
scenario
but
we're
dealing
with
a
big
bad
that
can
be
any
dead
person
it
wants
because
if
you
want
to
infiltrate
the
inner
circle
of
the
slayer
become
the
one
person
she
trusts
more
than
anybody
else
but
there's
no
way
that
we
can
know
actually
that's
not
true
the
first
can't
take
corporeal
form
so
it
can't
touch
anything
oh
it's
not
like
giles
hasn't
touched
anything
right
hahas
anyone
seen
giles
touch
anything
since
he
got
back
hold
anything
has
anybody
hugged
him
think
very
hard
wait—where're
you
the
desert
we're
gonna
find
giles
oh
good
let
me
just
get
some
tapes
for
the
car
i've
been
working
on
this
mix—
you're
not
coming
what
why
'cause
i
used
to
be
evil
no
actually
'cause
you're
annoying
but
that's
a
good
reason
too
wait
i—don't
leave
me
here
alone
i
keep
getting
attacked
in
this
house
actually
xand
what
if
this
is
all
part
of
the
plan
drive
you
guys
away
so
it
can
have
its
way
with
me
ever
think
of
that
i'll
risk
it
ok
well
if
you
leave
me
here
alone
i'll
do
something
evil
like
burning
something
or
gluing
things
together
for
crying
out
loud

least

keep
an
eye
on
him
xander

the
whole
bake
sale
phase

still
do
that
too
second
tuesday
of
every
month
i'm
sorry
i'm
kind
of
having
a
hard
time
with
the
whole
guy
event
thing

actually
her
i
can

the
thing
hi
here's
the
thing
i'll
just

out
of
the
way
i'm
sorta
screwed
up
but
i
mean
you
already
knew
that
'cause
you
lived
it
gotcha
but
she's
doing
so
much
better
now
amy
it's
ok
vaughn
i
wanna
do
this
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
really
see
myself
but
i
did
because
you
know
that's
the
crazy
thing
about
hitting
rock
bottom
you
get
to
relive
all
the
crappy
things
you
did
and
i
wanted
to
come
find
you
and
tell
you
that
i
was
here
working
on
things
with
these
guys
and
that
they're
good
and
that
i'm
sorry
but
you're
here
looking
like—
wow
how
did
this
happen
that's
what
we're
here
to
find
out
i
mean
if
we're
done
with
all
the
group
hugging
i
got
hit
with
this
like
glamour
thing
and
i
can't
seem
to
shake
it
myself
i
was
hoping
someone
here
might
be
able
to
help
yeah
see
the
thing
is
we're
more
about
healing
spirits
and
nurturing
our
life
force
here
oh
but
we'll
try
her
spirits
true
its
shell
a
lie
what
if
she
can't
handle
this
we
draw
upon
your
very
light
do
you
have
a
better
idea
give
back
the
form
the
soul
requires
see
that
the
balance
is
put
right
it
didn't
work
no
it
didn't
you
dumb
bitch
willow
you
slapped
me
no
i
didn't
it
wasn't
me
it
was
warren
willow
willow
ok
you're
upset
upset
upset
are
you
just
tuning
in
did
you
not
see
that
i'm
turning
into
him
it's
not
a
trick
it's
not
a
glamour
i'm
becoming
him
a
murderous
misogynist
man
i
mean
do
you
understand
what
he
did
what
i
could
do
i
killed
him
for
a
reason
getting
angry
isn't
helping
we
can
still
try
to—
you
understand
nothing
about
magic
in
case
you
hadn't
noticed
our
little
date—it's
over
willow
willow
wait
be
careful
oh
god
they
just
left
them
they
just
sealed
the
place
off
left
everything
as
it
was
i'm
thinking
brief
stay
yeah
you're
not
wrong
i
think
i
can
get
us
to
the
med
lab
find
the
drug
ok
i'll
go
r
ghost
is
is
hard
to
play
by
yourself
how
long
since
they
left
a
few
hours
if
it
is
the
first
and
i'm
not
saying
it
is
what're
we
expecting
to
find
he
didn't
bring
them
out
there
to
meditate
kinda
makes
you
grateful
you
weren't
a
potential
after
all
doesn't
it
safer
not
so
fast
with
the
big
phew
he
might
know
we're
coming
which
means
we're
already
too
late
and
we're
heading
out
to
the
middle
of
nowhere
with
no
slayer
no
powerful
witch
just
a
teenager
a
powerful
former
demon
and
two
big
geeks
ok
license
plate
game
maybe
look
at
me
crying
like
a
little
girl
you
hear
that
yep
think
something
survived
sounds
like
you
see
where
no
it
sounded
like
it
was
coming
from
over
there
whatever
it
is
it's
not—
buffy
where'd
they
go
they
took
off
it
was
a
little
too
creepy
even
for
us
you're
really
worried
about
her
look
she's
gonna
be
fine
really
she's
good
at
this
she's
strong
and
she's
dealt
with
a
lot
worse
long
before
she
ever
went
out
and
found
herself
a
big
old
potential
slayer
bodyguard
ok
just
have
a
little
faith
in
her
i
never
said
i
was
a
potential
slayer
oh
no
i
think
you
did
when
you
first
got
here
you
told
us—
no
i
didn't
how
did
you
know
who
i
was
oops
not
now
spike
so
same
model
as
last
time
how'd
that
work
out
for
you
you'd
be
amazed
touch
him
touch
him
oh
i
feel
him
i
feel
him
me
too
me
too
we
all
feel
each
other
including
some
of
us
who
don't
know
each
other
well
enough
to
take
such
liberties
thank
you
i
assume
there's
a
perfectly
reasonable
and
not
at
all
insane
explanation
here
we
thought
you
might
be
noncorporeal
evil
we
got
a
call
we
couldn't
remember
you
touching
anything
we
had
to
make
sure
you
were
ok
we
were
worried
oh
that's
very
sweet
now
wait
a
minute—you
think
i'm
evil
if
i
bring
a
group
of
girls
on
a
camping
trip
and
don't
touch
them
spike
hey
are
you
still
with
us
yeah
that
guy
was—
just
the
beginning
what's
happening
miss
summers
agent
finn
reported
that
you
tried
to
contact
him
earlier
today
i
knew
it
government
conspiracy
he
indicated
you
might
be
needing
our
assistance
we're
to
provide
you
anything
you
need
to
help
assface
here
those
were
his
exact
words
ma'am
med
team
tells
me
they
took
a
look
at
the
chip
you
were
right
it's
degraded
leave
it
as
it
is
much
longer
it'll
be
fatal
to
him
ok
so
how
long
t—
now
right
of
course
um
what
do
we
do
next
agent
finn
said
it
was
your
call
ma'am
my—what
was
my
call
all
decisions
regarding
hostile
17
are
to
be
left
in
your
hands
this
chipwe
can
either
repair
it
or
remove
it
tell
me
why
you
did
this
to
her
what
did
you
do
to
her
what
to
willow
oh
just
your
standard
penance
malediction
is
all
ok
and
that's
magic
crazy
talk
for
what
i
put
a
hex
on
her
i
got
that
part
but
why
warren
and
why
did
it
happen
after
we
kissed
oh
that's
rich
that
must've
been
some
kiss
you
must
be
good
answer
me
the
hex
i
cast
lets
the
victim's
subconscious
pick
the
form
of
their
punishment
it's
always
better
than
anything
i
can
come
up
with
elegant
you
know
undo
it
let
her
out
ok
oh
wait
i
forgot—no
why
would
you
do
this
to
her
you
really
hate
her
that
much
this
is
not
about
hate
it's
about
power
willow
always
had
all
the
power
long
before
she
even
knew
what
to
do
with
it
just
came
so
easy
for
her
the
rest
of
us—we
had
to
work
twice
as
hard
to
be
half
as
good
but
no
one
cares
about
how
hard
you
work
they
just
care
about
cute
sweet
willow
they
don't
know
how
weak
she
is
she
gave
in
to
evil—stuff
worse
than
i
can
even
imagine—
she
almost
destroyed
the
world
and
yet
everyone
keeps
on
loving
her
so
what's
wrong
with
having
a
little
fun
huh
taking
her
down
a
peg
or
two
fun
she's
disappearing
fading
away
in
that
creep
and
you
think
it's
fun
it
was
just
a
game
it's
not
my
fault
if
she's
losing
herself
i'm
gonna
stop
you
now
you
know
hey
i'm
not
the
bad
guy
here
but
i
wonder
where
he'd
be
right
about
now
well
that
was
a
hell
of
a
thing
think
you
can
just
do
that
to
me
that
i'd
let
you
get
away
with
it
do
get
away
with—
ok
let's
not
get
excited
it's
too
late
for
that
this
is
what
i
am
i
made
it
happen
and
i'll
make
it
stop
willow
what
did
you
make
happen
you
were
there
bitch
you
saw
it
i
killed
her
you
mean

you
kill
willow
it

your
fault

me
got
me
to
forget
tara
shut
up
shut
up
you
do
not
get
to
say
her
name
offering
it
up
to
whoever's
there
tricking
me
into
kissing
you
i
didn't—i
didn't
mean
what
i'm
saying
i—i
can't
make—
kennedy
i
can't
hold
on
he's
winning
no
i'm
being
punished
i
k—i
kissed
you
just—just
for
a
second
but
it
was
enough
i
let
her
go
i
didn't
mean
to
kissing
me
didn't
mean
th—
no
she
was
never

whole
magic

fairy
tales
