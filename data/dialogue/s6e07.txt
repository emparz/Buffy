every
single
night
the
same
arrangement
i
go
out
and
fight
the
fight
still
i
always
feel
this
strange
estrangement
nothing
here
is
real
nothing
here
is
right
i've
been
making
shows
of
trading
blows
just
hoping
no
one
knows
that
i've
been
going
through
the
motions
walking
through
the
part
nothing
seems
to
penetrate
my
heart
i
was
always
brave
and
kind
of
righteous
now
i
find
i'm
wavering
crawl
out
of
your
grave
you'll
find
this
fight
just
doesn't
mean
a
thing
she
ain't
got
that
swing
thanks
for
noticing
she
does
pretty
well
with
fiends
from
hell
but
lately
we
can
tell
that
she's
just
going
through
the
motions
going
through
the
motions
faking
it
somehow
she's
not
even
half
the
girl
she
ow
will
i
stay
this
way
forever
sleepwalk
through
my
life's
endeavor
how
can
i
repay
whatever
i
don't
want
to
beeeeee
going
through
the
motions
losing
all
my
drive
i
can't
even
see
if
this
is
really
me
and
i
just
want
to
be
aliiiiiive
good
morning
buffy
oh
hey
did
dawn
get
off
to
school
all
right
what
oh
uh
yeah
i
think
so
respect
the
cruller
and
tame
the
donut
that's
still
funny
sweetie
so
uh
no
research
nothing
going
on
monsters
or
whatnot
good
good
uh
so
did
anybody
uh
last
night
you
know
did
anybody
um
burst
into
song
merciful
zeus
we
thought
it
was
just
us
well
i
sang
but
i
had
my
guitar
at
the
hotel
it
was
bizarre
we
were
talking
and
then
it
was
like
buffy
like
you
were
in
a
musical
yeah
that
would
explain
the
huge
backing
orchestra
i
couldn't
see
and
the
synchronized
dancing
from
the
room
service
chaps
we
did
a
whole
duet
about
dish
washing
and
we
were
arguing
and
and
then
everything
rhymed
and
there
were
harmonies
and
the
dance
with
coconuts
there
was
an
entire
verse
about
the
couscous
it
was
very
disturbing
what
did
you
sing
about
i
don't
remember
but
iit
seemed
perfectly
normal
but
disturbing
and
not
the
natural
order
of
things
and
do
you
think
it'll
happen
again
i
don't
know
i
should
look
into
it
with
the
books
do
we
have
any
books
on
this
well
we
just
gotta
break
it
down
look
at
the
factors
before
it
happens
again
because
i
for
one
giles
begins
to
sing
interrupting
xander
i've
got
a
theory
that
it's
a
demon
a
dancing
demon
no
something
isn't
right
there
i've
got
a
theory
some
kid
is
dreamin'
and
we're
all
stuck
inside
his
wacky
broadway
nightmare
i've
got
a
theory
we
should
work
this
out
it's
getting
eerie
what's
this
cheery
singing
all
about
it
could
be
witches
some
evil
witches
which
is
ridiculous
'cause
witches
they
were
persecuted
wicca
good
and
love
the
earth
and
woman
power
and
i'll
be
over
here
i've
got
a
theory
it
could
be
bunnies
i've
got
a
bunnies
aren't
just
cute
like
everybody
supposes
they've
got
them
hoppy
legs
and
twitchy
little
noses
and
what's
with
all
the
carrots
what
do
they
need
such
good
eyesight
for
anyway
bunnies
bunnies
it
must
be
bunnies
or
maybe
midgets
i've
got
a
theory
we
should
work
this
fast
because
it
clearly
could
get
serious
before
it's
passed
i've
got
a
theory
it
doesn't
matter
what
can't
we
face
if
we're
together
what's
in
this
place
that
we
can't
weather
apocalypse
we've
all
been
there
the
same
old
trips
why
should
we
care
what
can't
we
do
if
we
get
in
it
we'll
work
it
through
within
a
minute
we
have
to
try
we'll
pay
the
price
it's
do
or
die
hey
i've
died
twice
what
can't
we
face
if
we're
together
what
can't
we
face
what's
in
this
place
that
we
can't
weather
if
we're
together
there's
nothing
we
can't
face
except
for
bunnies
see
okay
that
was
disturbing
i
thought
it
was
neat
so
what
is
it
what's
causing
it
i
thought
it
didn't
matter
well
i'm
not
exactly
quaking
in
my
stylish
yet
affordable
boots
but
there's
definitely
something
unnatural
going
on
here
and
that
doesn't
usually
lead
to
hugs
and
puppies
well
is
it
just
us
i
mean
is
it
only
happening
to
us
'cause
that
would
probably
mean
a
spell
or
buffy
goes
to
the
door
opens
it
the
bell
jingles
they
got
the
mustard
out
they
got
the
mustard
out
it's
not
just
us
oh
my
god
you
will
never
believe
what
happened
at
school
today
everybody
started
singing
and
dancing
i
gave
birth
to
a
pterodactyl
oh
my
god
did
it
sing
so
you
guys
too
huh
so
what'd
you
guys
sing
about
math
thathat's
right
the
the
volume
the
text
what
text
the
volumey
text
you
know
the
the
report
the
what
now
oh
there's
just
a
few
volumes
back
at
the
house
that
deal
with
mystical
chants
bacchanals
it
might
be
relevant
yeah
we
could
um
giles
well
i'm
a
hair's
breadth
from
investigating
bunnies
at
the
moment
so
i'm
open
to
anything
great
we'll
uh
go
check
it
out
and
uh
we'll
give
you
a
call
yeah
this
could
blow
the
whole
thing
wide
open
do
we
have
any
books
at
all
at
home
well
who
wants
to
be
cooped
up
on
a
day
like
this
the
sun
is
shining
there's
songs
going
on
those
guys
are
checking
you
out
what
whwhat
are
they
looking
at
the
hotness
of
you
doofus
those
boys
really
thought
i
was
hot
entirely
oh
my
god
i'm
cured
i
want
the
boys
do
i
have
to
fight
to
keep
you
'cause
i'm
not
large
with
the
butch
i'm
just
not
used
to
that
theythey
were
really
looking
at
me
and
you
can't
imagine
what
they
see
in
you
i
know
exactly
what
they
see
in
me
you
i
lived
my
life
in
shadow
never
the
sun
on
my
face
it
didn't
seem
so
sad
though
i
figured
that
was
my
place
now
i'm
bathed
in
light
something
just
isn't
right
i'm
under
your
spell
how
else
could
it
be
anyone
would
notice
me
it's
magic
i
can
tell
how
you
set
me
free
brought
me
out
so
easily
i
saw
a
world
enchanted
spirits
and
charms
in
the
air
i
always
took
for
granted
i
was
the
only
one
there
but
your
power
shone
brighter
than
any
i've
known
i'm
under
your
spell
nothing
i
can
do
you
just
took
my
soul
with
you
you
worked
your
charms
so
well
finally
i
knew
everything
i
dreamed
was
true
you
made
me
believe
ahhh
ahhh
ahhh
the
moon
to
the
tide
i
can
feel
you
inside
i'm
under
your
spell
surging
like
the
sea
wanting
you
so
helplessly
i
break
with
every
swell
lost
in
ecstasy
spread
beneath
my
willow
tree
you
make
me
complete
ou
make
me
complete
you
make
me
complete
you
make
me
i
bet
they're
not
even
working
who
now
willow
and
tara
you
see
the
way
they
were
with
each
other
the
getaroominess
to
them
i
bet
they're
singing
they're
probably
singing
right
now
i'm
sure
willow
and
tara
are
making
every
effort
oh
yeah
xander
buffy
it's
okay
i
do
know
about
this
stuff
besides
it's
all
kinda
romantic
no
it's
not
come
on
songs
dancing
around
what's
gonna
be
wrong
with
that
that's
entertainment
you
want
some
breakfast
baby
you
don't
have
to
go
to
work
nah
i
shut
the
crew
down
for
the
day
my
guys
start
dancing
around
me
i
don't
know
if
i
can
deal
it's
a
flab
thing
so
waffles
will
you
still
make
me
waffles
when
we're
married
no
i'll
only
make
them
for
myself
but
by
california
law
you
will
own
half
of
them
hey
how
about
omelettes
i
could
do
an
omelette
i've
almost
got
that
xander
continues
talking
unintelligibly
as
anya
sits
up
and
begins
to
sing
to
the
camera
this
is
the
man
that
i
plan
to
entangle
isn't
he
fine
my
claim
to
fame
was
to
maim
and
to
mangle
vengeance
was
mine
but
i'm
out
of
the
biz
the
name
i
made
i'll
trade
for
his
the
only
trouble
is
i'll
never
tell
she
is
the
one
she's
such
wonderful
fun
such
passion
and
grace
warm
in
the
night
when
i'm
right
in
her
tight
embrace
tight
embrace
i'll
never
let
her
go
the
love
we've
known
can
only
grow
there's
just
one
thing
that
no
i'll
never
tell
'cause
there's
nothing
to
tell
he
snores
she
wheezes
say
'housework'
and
he
freezes
she
eats
these
skeezy
cheeses
that
i
can't
describe
i
talk
he
breezes
she
doesn't
know
what
'please'
is
his
penis
got
diseases
from
a
chumash
tribe
the
vibe
gets
kind
of
scary
like
she
thinks
i'm
ordinary
like
it's
all
just
temporary
like
her
toes
are
kind
of
hairy
but
it's
all
very
well
'cause
god
knows
i'll
never
tell
when
things
get
rough
he
just
hides
behind
his
buffy
now
look
he's
getting
huffy
'cause
he
knows
that
i
know
she
clings
she's
needy
she's
also
really
greedy
she
nev
his
eyes
are
beady
this
is
my
verse
hello
she
look
at
me
i'm
dancing
crazy
you
know
you're
quite
the
charmer
my
knight
in
armor
you're
the
cutest
of
the
scoobies
with
your
lips
as
red
as
rubies
and
your
firm
yet
supple
tight
embrace
he's
swell
she's
sweller
he'll
always
be
my
feller
that's
why
i'll
never
tell
her
that
i'm
petrified
i've
read
this
tale
there's
wedding
then
betrayal
i
know
there'll
come
the
day
i'll
want
to
run
and
hide
i
lied
i
said
it's
easy
i've
tried
but
there's
these
fears
i've
can't
quell
is
she
looking
for
a
pot
of
gold
will
i
look
good
when
i've
gotten
old
will
our
lives
become
too
stressful
if
i'm
never
that
successful
when
i
get
so
worn
and
wrinkly
that
i
look
like
david
brinkley
am
i
crazy
am
i
dreamin'
am
i
marrying
a
demon
we
could
really
raise
the
beam
in
making
marriage
a
hell
so
thank
god
i'll
never
tell
i
swear
that
i'll
never
tell
my
lips
are
sealed
i
take
the
fifth
nothing
to
see
move
it
along
i'll
never
tell
it's
a
nightmare
it
has
to
be
stopped
it's
a
plague
it's
like
a
nightmare
about
a
plague
it
was
like
we
were
being
watched
it's
like
i
didn't
wanna
be
saying
things
anya
like
there
was
a
wall
missing
xander
but
they
just
kept
pouring
out
in
our
apartment
and
they
rhymed
and
they
were
mean
and
anya
like
there
were
only
three
walls
and
not
a
fourth
wall
and
xander
my
eyes
are
not
beady
my
toes
are
not
hairy
giles
you've
got
to
stop
it
well
i
am
looking
into
some
leads
and
i
anya
it's
just
clearly
our
number
is
a
retro
pastiche
that's
never
going
to
be
a
breakaway
pop
hit
work
with
me
british
man
give
me
an
axe
and
show
me
where
to
point
it
well
now
xander
it's
not
quite
that
simple
but
i
have
learned
about
some
disturbing
things
basically
they
continue
talking
in
the
background
as
we
focus
on
a
woman
who
is
standing
by
her
car
singing
to
a
policeman
the
cop
is
writing
her
a
parking
ticket
and
we
see
that
her
car
is
parked
next
to
a
fire
hydrant
as
she
sings
we
can
see
giles
xander
and
anya
standing
and
talking
in
background
i'm
asking
you
please
no
it
isn't
right
it
isn't
fair
there
was
no
parking
anywhere
i
think
that
hydrant
wasn't
there
why
can't
you
let
it
go
i
think
i've
paid
more
than
my
share
as
in
burnt
up
somebody
set
people
on
fire
that's
nuts
i
don't
know
one
more
verse
of
our
little
ditty
and
i
would've
been
looking
for
a
gas
can
well
clearly
emotions
are
running
high
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
these
people
burnt
up
from
the
inside
spontaneously
combusted
i've
only
seen
the
one
i
was
able
to
examine
the
body
while
the
police
were
taking
witness
arias
okay
but
we're
sure
that
the
things
are
related
the
singing
and
dancing
and
burning
and
dying
we're
not
sure
of
much
buffy's
looking
for
leads
at
the
local
demon
haunts
at
least
in
theory
she
is
but
she
doesn't
seem
to
xander
she's
easing
back
into
it
we
pulled
her
out
of
an
untold
hell
dimension
ergo
the
weirdness
the
important
thing
is
to
be
there
for
her
i'm
helping
her
as
much
as
i
can
but
uh
the
sun
sets
and
she
appears
come
to
serenade
me
so
you
know
what's
going
on
well
i've
seen
some
damn
funny
things
in
the
last
two
days
a
600
pound
chirago
demon
making
like
yma
sumac
that
one
will
stay
with
you
i
remain
immune
happy
to
say
drink
a
world
of
no
so
any
idea
what's
causing
this
oh
so
that's
all
you've
just
come
to
pump
me
for
information
what
else
would
i
wanna
pump
you
for
i
really
just
said
that
didn't
i
yeah
well
don't
wanna
bore
you
with
the
small
talk
don't
know
a
thing
what's
up
you're
all
bad
moody
nothing
glad
you
could
stop
by
it's
nothing
what
i
died
so
many
years
ago
but
you
can
make
me
feel
like
it
isn't
so
and
why
you
come
to
be
with
me
i
think
i
finally
know
mmm
mmm
you're
scared
ashamed
of
what
you
feel
and
you
can't
tell
the
ones
you
love
you
know
they
couldn't
deal
whisper
in
a
dead
man's
ear
it
doesn't
make
it
real
that's
great
but
i
don't
wanna
play
'cause
being
with
you
touches
me
more
than
i
can
say
but
since
i'm
only
dead
to
you
i'm
saying
stay
away
and
let
me
rest
in
peace
let
me
rest
in
peace
let
me
get
some
sleep
let
me
take
my
love
and
bury
it
in
a
hole
six
foot
deep
i
can
lay
my
body
down
but
i
can't
find
my
sweet
release
so
let
me
rest
in
peace
you
know
you've
got
a
willing
slave
and
you
just
love
to
play
the
thought
that
you
might
misbehave
but
till
you
do
i'm
telling
you
stop
visiting
my
grave
and
let
me
rest
in
peace
i
know
i
should
go
but
i
follow
you
like
a
man
possessed
there's
a
traitor
here
beneath
my
breast
and
it
hurts
me
more
than
you've
ever
guessed
if
my
heart
could
beat
it
would
break
my
chest
but
i
can
see
you're
unimpressed
so
leave
me
be
and
let
me
rest
in
peace
let
me
get
some
sleep
let
me
take
my
love
and
bury
it
in
a
hole
six
foot
deep
i
can
lay
my
body
down
but
i
can't
find
my
sweet
release
let
me
rest
in
peace
why
won't
you
let
me
rest
in
peace
so
you're
not
staying
then
lotta
homework
ah
math
it
seemed
cool
when
we
were
singing
about
it
willow
said
they
have
a
lead
on
the
whole
musical
extravaganza
evil
this
demon
that
can
be
summoned
some
sort
of
lord
of
the
dance
oh
but
not
the
scary
one
just
a
demon
um
do
they
know
who
summoned
it
they
don't
even
know
its
name
yet
but
willow
will
find
out
she's
the
brainy
type
hm
i'm
glad
you
guys
made
up
what
that
fight
you
guys
had
about
magic
and
stuff
it
gives
me
belly
rumblings
when
you
guys
fight
dawn
willow
and
i
never
fought
about
dawn
it's
okay
it's
just
you
guys
are
so
great
together
i
just
hate
it
when
you
tara
puts
her
hand
to
the
herb
on
her
blouse
removes
it
her
i'm
under
your
spell
melody
plays
in
background
but
that
was
the
only
fight
i've
seen
you
guys
have
anyway
but
i'm
still
glad
it's
over
dawn
i
um
there's
something
i
need
at
the
shop
will
you
be
okay
for
a
little
while
yes
the
fifteenyearold
can
spend
a
half
an
hour
alone
in
her
locked
house
ii
won't
be
gone
long
does
anybody
even
notice
does
anybody
even
care
why'd
you
run
away
don't
you
like
my
style
why
don't
you
come
and
play
i
guarantee
a
great
big
smile
the
mouth
disappears
from
his
hand
and
reappears
in
its
normal
place
i
come
from
the
imagination
and
i'm
here
strictly
by
your
invocation
so
what
do
you
say
why
don't
we
dance
awhile
i'm
the
hot
swing
i'm
the
twist
and
shout
when
you
gotta
sing
when
you
gotta
let
it
out
you
call
me
and
i
come
arunning
i
turn
the
music
on
i
bring
the
fun
in
now
we're
partyin'
that's
what
it's
all
about
'cause
i
know
what
you
feel
girl
i
know
just
what
you
feel
girl
so
you're
like
a
good
demon
bringing
the
fun
in
all
these
melodies

they
go
on
too
long
then
that
energy
starts
to
come
on
way
too
strong
all
those
hearts
laid
open
that
must
sting
plus
some
customers
just
start
combusting
that's
the
penalty
when
life
is
but
a
song
you
brought
me
down
into
this
town
so
when
we
blow
this
scene
back
we
will
go
to
my
kingdom
below
and
you
will
be
my
queen
'cause
i
know
what
you
feel
girl
no
you
see
you
and
me
wouldn't
be
very
regal
i'll
make
it
real
girl
what
i
mean
i'm
fifteen
so
this
queen
thing's
illegal
i
can
bring
whole
cities
to
ruin
and
still
have
time
to
get
a
softshoe
in
well
that's
great
but
i'm
late
and
i'd
hate
to
delay
her
something's
cooking
i'm
at
the
griddle
i
bought
nero
his
very
first
fiddle
she'll
get
pissed
if
i'm
missed
see
my
sister's
the
slayer
the
slayer
yuhhuh
find
her
tell
her
tell
her
everything
just
get
her
here
i
want
to
see
the
slayer
burn
now
we're
partying
that's
what
it's
all
about
good
good
i
feel
like
i
should
bow
or
have
honor
or
something
it
may
seem
hokey
but
we
need
to
work
on
precision
and
concentration
as
much
as
power
we're
still
not
sure
what
we're
facing
oh
you'll
figure
it
out
i'm
just
worried
this
whole
session's
gonna
turn
into
some
training
montage
from
an
80's
movie
ah
well
if
we
hear
any
inspirational
power
chords
we'll
just
lie
down
until
they
go
away
anyway
i
don't
think
we
need
to
work
that
much
on
your
strength
yeah
i'm
pretty
spry
for
a
corpse
have
you
spoken
to
dawn
about
that
incident
at
halloween
oh
i
thought
you
took
care
of
that
right
what
would
i
do
without
you
okay
i'm
ready
you're
not
ready
for
the
world
outside
you
keep
pretending
but
you
just
can't
hide
i
know
i
said
that
i'd
be
standing
by
your
side
but
i
your
path's
unbeaten
and
it's
all
uphill
and
you
can
meet
it
but
you
never
will
and
i'm
the
reason
that
you're
standing
still
but
i
i
wish
i
could
say
the
right
words
to
lead
you
through
this
land
wish
i
could
play
the
father
and
take
you
by
the
hand
wish
i
could
stay
here
but
now
i
understand
i'm
standing
in
the
way
the
cries
around
you
you
don't
hear
at
all
'cause
you
know
i'm
here
to
take
that
call
so
you
just
lie
there
when
you
should
be
standing
tall
but
i
i
wish
i
could
lay
your
arms
down
and
let
you
rest
at
last
wish
i
could
slay
your
demons
but
now
that
time
has
passed
wish
i
could
stay
here
your
stalwart
standing
fast
but
i've
been
standing
in
the
way
i'm
just
standing
in
the
way
did
you
just
say
something
i'm
under
your
spell
god
how
can
this
be
playing
with
my
memory
you
know
i've
been
through
hell
willow
don't
you
see
there'll
be
nothing
left
of
me
you
made
me
believe
believe
me
i
don't
wanna
go
and
it'll
grieve
me
'cause
i
love
you
so
but
we
both
know
wish
i
could
say
the
right
words
to
lead
you
through
this
land
wish
i
could
play
the
father
and
take
you
by
the
hand
wish
i
could
trust
that
it
was
just
this
once
but
i
must
do
what
i
must
i
can't
adjust
to
this
disgust
we're
done
and
i
just
wish
i
could
stay
wish
i
could
stay
wish
i
could
stay
wish
i
could
stay
lookie
lookie
what
i
found
isis
this
the
demon
guy
tara
works
for
him
has
a
nice
little
story
for
the
slayer
don't
you
come
on
then
sing
my
master
has
the
slayer's
sister
hostage
at
the
bronze
because
she
summoned
him
and
at
midnight
he's
going
to
take
her
to
the
underworld
to
be
his
queen
what
does
he
want
her
if
that's
all
you've
got
to
say
then
spike
tries
to
grab
the
minion
but
he
breaks
free
and
runs
off
strong
someday
he'll
be
a
real
boy
so
dawn's
in
trouble
must
be
tuesday
ii
just
left
her
for
a
few
minutes
oh
it's
not
your
fault
so
what's
the
plan
plan
schman
let's
mount
up
no
uh
dawn
may
have
had
the
wrong
idea
in
summoning
this
creature
but
i've
seen
some
of
these
underworld
child
bride
deals
and
and
they
never
end
well
well
maybe
once
we're
not
just
gonna
stay
here
yes
we
are
buffy's
going
alone
gah
don't
be
a
stupid
git
there
is
no
giles
if
i
want
your
opinion
spike
i'll
i'll
never
want
your
opinion
a
little
confusion
spell
could
tara
no
i
mean
i
don't
think
it'll
help
look
forget
them
slayer
i've
got
your
back
i
thought
you
wanted
me
to
stay
away
from
you
isn't
that
what
you
sang
spike
sing
a
widdle
song
would
you
say
it
was
a
breakaway
pop
hit
or
more
of
a
book
number
let
it
go
sweetie
fine
i
hope
you
dance
till
you
burn
you
and
the
little
bit
you're
really
not
coming
it's
up
to
you
buffy
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
your
best
i
touch
the
fire
and
it
freezes
me
i
look
into
it
and
it's
black
why
can't
i
feel
my
skin
should
crack
and
peel
i
want
the
fire
back
now
through
the
smoke
she
calls
to
me
to
make
my
way
across
the
flame
to
save
the
day
or
maybe
melt
away
i
guess
it's
all
the
same
so
i
will
walk
through
the
fire
'cause
where
else
can
i
turn
i
will
walk
through
the
fire
and
let
it
the
torch
i
bear
is
scorching
me
buffy's
laughing
i've
no
doubt
i
hope
she
fries
i'm
free
if
that
bitch
dies
i
better
help
her
out
'cause
she
is
drawn
to
the
fire
some
people
she
will
never
learn
and
she
will
walk
through
the
fire
and
let
it
will
this
do
a
thing
to
change
her
am
i
leaving
dawn
in
danger
is
my
slayer
too
far
gone
to
care
what
if
buffy
can't
defeat
it
beady
eyes
is
right
we're
needed
or
we
could
just
sit
around
and
glare
we'll
see
it
through
it's
what
we're
always
here
to
do
so
we
will
walk
through
the
fire
so
one
by
one
they
turn
from
me
i
guess
my
friends
can't
face
the
cold
but
why
i
froze
not
one
among
them
knows
and
never
can
be
told
what
can't
we
face
if
we're
together
she
came
from
the
grave
much
graver
first
he'll
kill
her
then
i'll
save
her
everything
is
turning
out
so
dark
no
i'll
save
her
then
i'll
kill
her
i
think
this
line's
mostly
filler
what's
it
gonna
take
to
strike
a
spark
so
one
by
one
they
turn
to
me
the
distant
redness
as
their
guide
that
single
flame
ain't
what
they
had
in
mind
it's
what
they
have
inside
going
through
the
motions
walking
through
the
part
these
endless
days
are
finally
ending
in
a
blaze
she
will
come
to
me
and
we
are
caught
in
the
fire
the
point
of
no
return
so
we
will
walk
through
the
fire
and
let
it
burn
let
it
burn
let
it
burn
let
it
burn
showtime
i
love
a
good
entrance
how
are
you
with
death
scenes
you
got
a
name
i've
got
a
hundred
well
i
ought
to
know
what
to
call
you
if
you're
gonna
be
my
brotherinlaw
buffy
i
swear
i
didn't
do
it
don't
worry
you're
not
going
anywhere
i
am
what
deal's
this
i
can't
kill
you
you
take
me
to
hellsville
in
her
place
what
if
i
kill
you
trust
me
won't
help
hm
that's
gloomy
that's
life
come
now
is
that
really
what
you
feel
isn't
life
a
miraculous
thing
i
think
you
already
know
life's
a
show
and
we
all
play
our
parts
and
when
the
music
starts
we
open
up
our
hearts
it's
all
right
if
some
things
come
out
wrong
we'll
sing
a
happy
song
and
you
can
sing
along
where
there's
life
there's
hope
every
day's
a
gift
wishes
can
come
true
whistle
while
you
work
so
hard
all
day
to
be
like
other
girls
to
fit
in
in
this
glittering
world
don't
give
me
songs
she
needs
backup
anya
tara
don't
give
me
songs
give
me
something
to
sing
about
ahhhhh
i
need
something
to
sing
about
ahhhhh
life's
a
song
you
don't
get
to
rehearse
and
every
single
verse
can
make
it
that
much
worse
still
my
friends
don't
know
why
i
ignore
the
million
things
or
more
i
should
be
dancing
for
all
the
joy
life
sends
family
and
friends
all
the
twists
and
bends
knowing
that
it
ends
well
that
depends
on
if
they
let
you
go
on
if
they
know
enough
to
know
that
when
you've
bowed
you
leave
the
crowd
there
was
no
pain
no
fear
no
doubt
till
they
pulled
me
out
of
heaven
so
that's
my
refrain
i
live
in
hell
'cause
i've
been
expelled
from
heaven
i
think
i
was
in
heaven
so
give
me
something
to
sing
about
please
give
me
something
life's
not
a
song
life
isn't
bliss
life
is
just
this
it's
living
you'll
get
along
the
pain
that
you
feel
you
only
can
heal
by
living
you
have
to
go
one
living
so
one
of
us
is
living
the
hardest
thing
in
this
world
is
to
live
in
it
now
that
was
a
showstopping
number
not
quite
the
fireworks
that
i
was
looking
for
get
out
of
here
mm
i
smell
power
i
guess
the
little
missus
and
i
should
be
on
our
way
that's
never
going
to
happen
i
don't
make
the
rules
she
summoned
me
i
so
did
not
he
keeps
saying
that
you
have
my
talisman
on
sweet
thing
oh
but
no
i
i
um
uh
this
at
at
the
magic
box
on
the
floor
i
was
i
was
cleaning
and
i
forgot
but
i
didn't
summon
anything
well
now
that's
a
twist
if
it
was
in
the
shop
then
one
of
us
probably
xander
well
i
didn't
know
what
was
gonna
happen
i
just
thought
there
were
gonna
be
dances
and
songs
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
we'd
we'd
work
out
get
a
happy
ending
i
think
everything
worked
out
just
fine
does
this
mean
that
i
have
to
be
your
queen
it's
tempting
but
i
think
we'll
waive
that
clause
just
this
once
big
smiles
everyone
you
beat
the
bad
guy
what
a
lot
of
fun
you
guys
have
been
real
swell
and
there's
not
a
one
who
can
say
this
ended
well
all
those
secrets
you've
been
concealing
say
you're
happy
now
once
more
with
feeling
now
i
gotta
run
see
you
all
in
heeeeeeell
where
do
we
go
from
here
where
do
we
go
from
here
the
battle's
done
and
we
kind
of
won
so
we
sound
our
victory
cheer
where
do
we
go
from
here
why
is
the
path
unclear
when
we
know
home
is
near
understand
we'll
go
hand
in
hand
but
we'll
walk
alone
in
fear
tell
me
where
do
we
go
from
here
when
does
the
end
appear
bugger
this
when
do
the
trumpets
cheer
the
curtains
close
on
a
kiss
god
knows
we
can
tell
the
end
is
near
hey
where
do
we
go
from
here
you
should
go
back
inside
finish
the
big
group
sing
get
your
kumbayayas
out
i
don't
want
to
the
day
you
suss
out
what
you
do
want
there'll
probably
be
a
parade
seventysix
bloody
trombones
spike
look
you
don't
have
to
say
anything
i
touch
the
fire
and
it
freezes
me
i
died
i
look
into
it
and
it's
black
this
isn't
real
but
i
just
want
to
feel
so
many
years
ago
but
you
can
make
me
feel
where
do
we
go
from
here
