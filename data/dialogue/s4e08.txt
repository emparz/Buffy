oh
looking
for
me
holywhat
do
you
want
uhh
hey
look
who's
home
a
slayer
why
don't
you
just
go
back
where
you
came
from
things
were
great
before
you
came
and
they
say
one
person
can't
make
a
difference
of
all
the
duties
of
a
dean
one
of
the
most
pleasant
is
to
see
a
colleague
realize
a
dream
ladies
gentlemen
students
i
present
to
you
professor
gerhardt
of
the
anthropology
department
when
i
first
realized
we
were
outgrowing
our
current
cultural
center
i
was
concerned
then
i
realized
it
was
like
seeing
one's
child
grow
up
and
move
on
to
better
things
in
this
case
a
spacious
new
facility
to
be
built
on
this
site
look
at
him
have
you
ever
seen
anything
so
masculine
you
mean
guerrero
or
his
wife
i
think
she
means
oh
very
manly
not
at
all
village
people
so
much
sexier
than
the
outfit
from
his
last
job
oh
i
miss
the
free
hot
dogs
on
sticks
i'm
imagining
having
sex
with
him
right
now
and
that's
why
it's
appropriate
that
the
groundbreaking
for
the
uc
sunnydale
cultural
partnership
center
is
taking
place
so
soon
before
thanksgiving
because
that's
what
the
melting
pot
is
about
contributions
from
all
cultures
making
our
culture
stronger
what
a
load
of
horse
hooey
we
have
a
counterpoint
yeah
thanksgiving
isn't
about
blending
of
2
cultures
it's
about
one
culture
wiping
out
another
and
then
they
make
animated
specials
about
the
part
where
with
the
maize
and
the
big
big
belt
buckles
they
don't
show
you
the
next
scene
where
all
the
bison
die
and
squanto
takes
a
musket
ball
in
the
stomach
ok
now
for
some
of
that
you
were
channeling
your
mother
well
yeah
sort
of
that's
why
she
doesn't
celebrate
thanksgiving
or
columbus
day
you
know
the
destruction
of
the
indigenous
peoples
i
know
it
sounds
a
little
overwrought
but
really
she'sshe's
right
yeah
i
guess
i
never
really
thought
about
it
that
way
with
mom
at
aunt
darlene's
this
year
i'm
not
getting
a
thanksgiving
maybe
it's
just
as
well
well
i
think
that's
a
shame
i
love
a
ritual
sacrifice
it's
not
really
a
one
of
those
to
commemorate
a
past
event
you
kill
and
eat
an
animal
it's
a
ritual
sacrifice
with
pie
and
thus
a
symbolic
beginning
what's
she
doing
xander
said
he
was
going
to
dig
i
want
to
see
xander
dig
that's
part's
just
ceremonial
well
it
bites
she's
not
rippling
at
all
oh
look
there
he
goes
look
at
him
verydiggy
soon
he'll
be
sweating
i'm
imagining
having
sex
with
him
again
imaginary
xander
is
quite
the
machine
uhh
ow
i'm
ok
i'm
uh
i'm
ok
where
am
i
okay
while
they
were
pulling
xander
out
i
heard
a
couple
of
the
anthro
professors
talking
about
it
man
were
they
excited
it's
the
old
sunnydale
mission
which
everyone
thought
was
lost
huh
is
there
something
out
there
hmm
oh
no
i'm
sorry
a
lost
mission
i
mean
a
hairbrush
i
can
understand
and
by
the
way
i
will
find
that
and
get
that
back
to
you
but
how
do
you
lose
a
mission
huge
earthquake
in
1812
everyone
just
assumed
the
mission
was
leveled
instead
they
built
right
over
it
it's
like
what
happened
in
the
thirties
with
that
church
the
master
was
in
doesn't
it
make
you
wonder
what
else
is
there
like
right
under
our
feet
mostly
i've
just
found
sewers
full
of
demons
oh
right
outside
we
hear
students
running
mad
through
the
halls
with
excitement
man
it's
crazy
out
there
mmhmm
postmidterm
frenzy
and
the
holiday
everyone's
going
home
it
looks
like
a
lot
of
lucky
moms
are
gonna
be
getting
brimming
baskets
of
dirty
laundry
it's
so
not
fair
i
mean
they
all
get
a
family
holiday
just
because
they
can
go
home
to
their
families
hmm
it's
a
turvytopsy
world
you
know
what
i
should
have
my
own
thanksgiving
i
can
cook
the
meal
just
like
my
mom
does
have
all
you
guys
over
it'll
be
great
buffy
earlier
you
agreed
with
me
about
thanksgiving
it's
a
sham
it's
all
about
death
it
is
a
sham
but
it's
a
sham
with
yams
it's
a
yam
sham
you're
not
gonna
jokeyrhyme
your
way
out
of
this
one
i
know
but
i
want
it
it's
like
professor
walsh
was
saying
about
sense
memory
i
smell
a
roasting
turkey
and
i'm
8
years
old
i
liked
having
that
to
look
forward
to
everything's
different
now
well
i
suppose
there
could
be
slight
yams
i
mean
we
could
definitely
use
a
little
comfort
food
i
bet
giles
doesn't
have
any
plans
and
xander
always
tries
to
avoid
all
of
his
family
gatherings
ooh
we
could
not
invite
anya
i
don't
know
she
and
xander
seem
pretty
tight
lately
look
pilgrims
aside
isn't
that
the
whole
point
of
thanksgiving
everybody
has
a
place
to
go
man
i'm
beat
we'll
do
one
more
sweep
then
cash
it
in
i
gotta
pack
tonight
you
got
a
flight
wednesday
night
professor
walsh
wants
me
here
for
the
debriefing
that's
a
pretty
short
thanksgiving
hey
with
a
hostile
on
the
loose
we're
lucky
to
be
going
home
at
all
it's
neutered
the
implant
works
great
he
can't
hurt
a
single
living
thing
as
long
as
he
knows
about
the
initiative
he's
a
threat
we
do
this
the
professor's
way
mama's
boy
that's
a
nasty
cough
you
might
need
to
spend
the
weekend
in
quarantine
oh
no
i'm
done
coughing
i
just
don't
want
anyone
getting
sick
xander
what
are
you
doing
you're
supposed
to
be
digging
i
went
to
watch
you
digging
and
you
weren't
there
doing
it
i'm
going
now
justkinda
tough
getting
going
today
your
head
is
moist
oh
you're
sick
well
you
can't
go
to
work
uh
oh
anya
you're
pasty
and
wet
and
disgusting
they
can
dig
without
you
look
i
don't
really
feel
that
bad
i
inflicted
a
lot
of
putrefying
diseases
on
men
when
i
was
an
avenging
demon
and
you
look
like
you're
getting
all
of
them
ok
i'll
stay
but
you
should
go
you
could
catch
it
we'll
die
together
it's
romantic
let
me
get
your
trousers
off
you're
a
strange
girlfriend
i'm
a
girlfriend
uhthere's
a
chance
i'm
delirious
ah
yes
well
whatever
it
is
that's
making
you
sick
so
far
i
like
it
it's
a
very
exciting
opportunity
i
can't
wait
to
go
down
there
myself
it's
justwell
it's
means
we're
going
to
have
to
start
looking
for
a
new
location
no
it's
really
up
to
the
dean
i
just
hope
this
doesn't
cost
us
another
year
ok
talk
to
you
later
i'll
never
get
used
to
this
one
day
she's
at
the
friendship
ceremony
the
next
day
she's
on
the
news
the
coroner's
office
said
she
was
missing
an
ear
so
i'm
thinking
maybe
we're
looking
for
a
witch
there's
some
great
spells
that
work
much
better
with
an
ear
in
the
mix
that's
one
fun
little
hobby
you've
got
there
will
oror
maybe
an
earharvesting
demon
thatit's
like
building
another
demon
completely
out
of
ears
orooh
thought
we're
just
assuming
someone
else
cut
off
the
ear
what
if
it
was
selfinflicted
like
van
gogh
soshe
brutally
stabs
herself
dumped
the
body
then
cut
off
her
own
ear
no
she
cut
off
her
ear
then
killed
herself
then
dumped
the
body
i'm
really
off
my
game
aren't
i
yeah
wait
something's
missing
from
this
case
early
1800
chumash
knife
there's
a
picture
what's
it
look
like
pretty
darn
scary
it
more
like
a
riot
than
a
ralph's
i
thought
i
was
going
to
have
to
use
slayer
moves
on
this
one
woman
who
was
completely
hoarding
the
pumpkin
pie
filling
and
at
some
point
you
are
going
to
tell
me
about
the
murder
oh
right
the
knife
was
some
sort
of
indian
artifact
chumash
i
think
that's
all
we
got
oh
chumash
indians
they
were
indigenous
to
this
whole
area
that's
interesting
then
of
course
the
murder
weapon
might
have
just
been
a
convenient
choice
uhuh
there
was
a
big
ol'
scissors
lying
right
there
that
knife
was
picked
for
a
reason
do
you
even
own
a
turkey
pan
tell
me
again
why
we're
not
doing
this
at
your
house
giles
if
you
would
like
to
get
by
in
american
society
then
you
are
going
to
have
to
follow
our
traditions
you're
the
patriarch
you
have
to
host
the
festivities
or
it's
all
meaningless
and
this
is
in
no
way
an
elaborate
scheme
to
stick
me
with
the
cleanup
how
about
that
ceremonial
knife
huh
pretty
juicy
piece
of
clueage
don't
you
think
yes
all
right
i'll
look
into
the
chumash
connection
and
see
if
there's
any
ritual
significance
to
the
ear
removal
thank
you
you
all
right
yeah
uh
i
still
need
to
pick
up
a
few
things
so
i'll
check
in
and
keep
your
hands
off
the
food
oh
i'll
try
and
restrain
myself
from
eating
uncooked
potatoes
and
cranberries
so
what
do
you
think
she
sounds
good
kind
of
intense
about
this
thanksgiving
thing
i
think
perhaps
she's
a
little
lonely
but
i
meant
about
the
murder
whatever
killed
the
woman
in
the
museum
that's
probably
the
danger
yeah
well
this
danger
your
friend
has
some
ominous
vision
about
buffy
it's
all
terribly
vague
i
mean
there
are
other
things
happening
on
this
campus
well
maybe
i'm
wrong
but
i
gotta
try
something
i
can't
just
keep
watching
i'm
glad
that
you're
watching
out
for
her
but
i
feel
i
should
remind
you
that
she's
not
helpless
and
it's
not
your
job
to
keep
her
safe
it's
not
yours
anymore
either
are
you
going
to
walk
away
all
right
but
i
feel
we
should
tell
her
i
don't
like
keeping
this
secret
no
if
she
knew
i
was
here
it
was
distract
her
it
could
get
her
hurt
i
don't
want
to
get
in
the
way
um
i'm
assuming
that
there's
some
connection
to
the
old
mission
something
is
angry
about
being
disturbed
or
maybe
it
was
trapped
there
and
now
it's
released
something
that
has
a
fondness
for
ancient
weapons
you
know
father
gabriel
no
he
knows
the
history
of
this
place
pretty
well
his
family
dates
back
to
mission
times
he
might
be
able
to
fill
in
some
blanks
ok
well
i'll
see
about
contacting
him
where
are
you
going
to
watch
her
it's
not
fair
you
know
that's
what
she'd
say
you
can
see
her
but
she
can't
see
you
believe
me
i'm
not
getting
the
good
half
of
this
deal
to
be
on
the
outside
looking
in
at
what
i
can't
well
i'd
forgotten
how
bad
it
feels
but
you
have
whipped
cream
i
saw
it
in
giles'
fridge
but
that's
whipped
cream
in
a
canister
look
it's
only
right
if
you
whip
it
yourself
hey
and
then
later
we
can
churn
our
own
butter
and
make
sweaters
out
of
sheep
ok
it's
the
last
thing
i
promise
besides
i
have
an
appointment
with
that
priest
that
giles
called
about
he
thinks
he
might
have
some
information
buffy
hey
buffy
riley
where'd
you
come
from
i
didn't
see
you
at
all
oh
just
across
the
street

a
couple
of
blocks
down
hey
willow

a
vision

in
danger

she
sees
me
it'll
be
worse

i
don't
get

all
this
leaving
for
her
own
good
garbage
because

what
it
is
you

just
give
up
because
there's
obstacles

not
have
a
ricer
well
do
you
have
one
at
home
i
don't
know
what's
a
ricer
we'll
mash
them
with
forks
much
like
the
pilgrims
must
have
did
you
catch
the
part
about
the
innocent
people
yes
ok
and
i
do
want
to
stop
him
i'd
just
like
to
find
a
nonslayee
way
to
do
it
hey
hey
peas
peas
these
are
frozen
what's
all
that
atrocities
i
got
the
full
poop
on
the
chumash
indians
and
our
fabulous
buried
mission
you
said
you
were
going
to
get
fresh
ones
atrocities
peas
they
come
in
little
pods
you
were
going
to
shell
them
i
didn't
have
time
i
was
busy
reading
about
the
chumash
war
the
chumash
were
peaceful
oh
they
were
peaceful
all
right
they
were
fluffy
indigenous
kittens
till
we
came
along
they're
gonna
be
mushy
they
won't
be
mushy
i
like
mushy
peas
you're
the
reason
we
had
to
have
pilgrims
in
the
first
place
so
what
happened
to
the
chumash
how
about
imprisonment
forced
labor
herded
like
animals
into
a
mission
full
of
bad
european
diseases
boy
cultural
partnership
center
really
didn't
stress
any
of
that
stuff
not
even
a
diorama
and
it
gets
better
the
few
chumash
who
tried
to
rebel
were
hanged
and
when
a
group
was
accused
of
stealing
cattle
they
were
killed
men
women
and
children
and
for
proof
to
bring
back
to
their
accusers
they
cut
off
their
ears
so
hus
wasn't
kidding
about
the
rightful
vengeance
routine
he's
recreating
all
the
wrongs
done
to
his
people
and
it's
up
to
us
to
stop
him
yes
but
after
dinner
right
are
you
sure
we
shouldn't
be
helping
him
no
i
think
perhaps
we
won't
help
the
angry
spirit
with
his
rape
and
pillage
and
murder
well
ok
no
but
we
should
be
helping
him
redress
his
wrongs
bring
the
atrocities
to
light
if
the
history
books
are
full
of
them
i'd
say
they
already
are
giving
his
land
back
it's
not
exactly
ours
to
give
i
don't
think
you
wanna
help
i
think
you
just
wanna
slay
the
demon
then
go
la
la
la
and
i
think
your
sympathy
for
his
plight
has
blinded
you
to
certain
urgent
facts
we
have
to
stop
this
thing
ok
unfeeling
guy
willow
that's
not
fair
i
have
to
baste
willow
i
i
have
reason
to
believe
buffy
herself
may
be
in
particular
danger
from
this
menace
you
mean
angel
i
saw
him
too
that's
not
terribly
stealthy
of
him
i
think
he's
lost
his
edge
but
buffy
doesn't
know
oh
no
not
a
peep
well
that's
good
but
this
is
why
i
think
we
should
all
keep
a
level
head
in
this
and
i
happen
to
think
mine
is
the
level
head
and
yours
is
the
one
things
would
roll
off
of
happy
thanksgiving
xander
you
look
like
death
are
you
ok
you
didn't
bring
rolls
the
doctor
couldn't
figure
out
was
up
with
me
he
said
i
had
a
lot
of
symptoms
that
didn't
connect
i
think
they
do
connect
what
to
this
chumash
spirit
vengeance
guy
didn't
you
say
the
chumash
got
all
diseased
when
they
were
all
holed
up
in
the
mission
yeah
this
has
a
better
account
of
everything
it
lists
the
various
various
as
in
well
the
important
thing
is
not
to
panic
you
just
recited
the
mystical
paniccausing
incantation
so
little
hope
there
let's
talk
about
the
various
well
they
did
suffer
from
malaria
some
smallpox
i
was
gonna
say
smallpox
you
know
syphilis
but
basically
syphilis
well
but
this
is
probably
mystical
and
it'll
all
go
away
as
soon
as
as
soon
as
what
we
still
don't
know
what
we're
gonna
do
well
maybe
i
can
find
something
let's
give
him
some
land
i'm
sure
that'll
clear
everything
right
up
sarcasm
accomplishes
nothing
giles
it's
sort
of
an
end
in
itself
can
we
come
rocketing
back
to
the
part
about
me
and
my
new
syphilis
it'll
make
you
blind
and
insane
but
it
won't
kill
you
the
smallpox
will
maybe
there's
a
wiccan
spell
that
can
cure
it
something
regular
medicine
doesn't
know
ooh
there
was
a
potion
sage
saltonion
that's
the
stuffing
oh
god
uh
you're
gonna
get
vesicles
and
pustules
they
have
pictures
i
hate
this
guy
he's
just
doing
what
was
done
to
him
i
didn't
give
him
syphilis
no
but
you
freed
his
spirit
and
after
a
century
of
unrest
he
saw
you
as
one
of
his
oppressors
what
so
he
rises
up
and
infects
the
first
guy
he
sees
that's
no
fair
like
you've
never
woken
up
cranky
but
why
the
others
why
them
particularly
so
we
take
this
guy
out
buffy
it
is
for
to
be
slaying
sometime
soon
yeah
that's
sort
of
the
question
before
the
court
question
there
are
2
sides
to
it
slaying
him
the
representative
from
syphilis
votes
yea
it's
not
that
simple
he's
a
vengeance
demon
you
don't
talk
to
vengeance
demons
you
kill
them
i
didn't
know
you
felt
that
way
what
anyway
he's
a
spirit
not
a
demon
yes
and
we've
never
faced
this
sort
of
spirit
before
we
really
don't
know
what
will
kill
it
again
with
the
killing
figuratively
speaking
or
bind
it
or
whatever
yes
willow
we
all
appreciate
your
perspective
sometimes
vengeance
is
justified
you
know
that
i
didn't
mean
you
i
don't
think
anyone
appreciates
the
truth
of
the
situation
oh
i
think
we
do
this
is
no
good
it
needs
more
condensed
milk
buffy
xander's
in
real
danger
are
you
sure
the
solution
is
pie
over
bickering
and
confusion
i'll
take
pie
we
will
find
a
solution
and
we
will
have
a
nice
dinner
ok
both
end
of
story
i'm
having
thanksgiving
and
it'll
be
perfect
hus
won't
stop
vengeance
is
never
sated
buffy
hatred
is
a
cycle
all
he
will
do
is
kill
help
me
ohh
what
part
of
help
me
do
you
not
understand
the
part
where
i
help
you
come
on
i'm
parboiling
out
here
want
me
to
help
make
it
quicker

safe
i
can't
bite
anyone
willow
tell'
em
what
i
did
you
said
you
were
gonna
kill

but
let's
skip
that
part
and
get
to
the
part
where
i
couldn't
bite
you
it's
true
he
had
trouble
performing
yeah
well
it
looks
like
they've
done
me
for
good
um
what
are
you
saying
i'm
saying
that
spike
had
a
little
trip
to
the
vet
and
now
he
doesn't
chase
the
other
puppies
anymore
i
can't
bite

i
can't
even

my
circulation
you
don't

more
important
things
to
worry
about
i
came
to
you
in
friendship
well
all
right
seething
hatred
but
i've
got
useful
information
and
i
feel
i'm
being
mistreated
so
tell
me
everything
you
know
i'm
too
hungry
to
remember
everything
then
sit
uh
how
much
butter
goes
in
with
these
about
half
a
stick
and
a
quarter
cup
of
brandy
you
do
have
brandy
don't
you

oh
yes
um
on
the
bookcase
i
wouldn't
say
no
to
a
brandy
what's
wrong
the
victims
apart
from
xander
hus
has
targeted
authority
figures
father
gabriel
the
curator
of
the
cultural
center
who
else
fits
this
pattern
just
a
small
brandy
the
dean
dean
guerrero
he's
the
king
of
us
and
he
was
at
the
ceremony
likely
candidate
we
should
warn
him
will
anything
in
those
books
about
how
to
stop
a
native
american
spirit
guy
some
nice
nonjudgmental
way
to
you
know
kill
him
i'm
not
gonna
help
you
kill
him
i'm
not
on
board
what
choice
do
we
have
buffy
this
isn't
a
western
we're
not
at
fortgiles
with
the
cavalry
coming
to
save
us
it's
one
lonely
guy
oppressed
warrior
guy
who's
just
trying
to
kill
a
lot
of
people
i
didn't
say
he
was
right
will
you
know
how
bad
i
feel
about
this
it's
eating
me
up
14
cup
of
brandy
and
let
it
simmer
but
even
though
it's
hard
we
have
to
end
this
yes
he's
been
wronged
and
i
personally
would
be
ready
to
apologize
oh
someone
put
a
stake
in
me
you
got
a
lot
of
volunteers
in
here
i
just
can't
take
all
this
mambypamby
boohooing
about
the
bloody
indians
uh
the
preferred
term
you
won
all
right
you
came
in
and
you
killed
them
and
you
took
their
land
that's
what
conquering
nations
do
it's
what
caesar
did
and
he's
not
going
around
saying
i
came
i
conquered
i
felt
really
bad
about
it
the
history
of
the
world
isn't
people
making
friends
you
had
better
weapons
and
you
massacred
them
end
of
story
well
i
think
the
spaniards
actually
did
a
lot
of
not
that
i
don't
like
spaniards
listen
to
you
how
you
gonna
fight
anyone
with
that
attitude
we
don't
wanna
fight
anyone
i
just
wanna
have
thanksgiving
heh
heh
yeahgood
luck
if
we
could
talk
to
him
you
exterminated
his
race
what
could
you
possibly
say
that
would
make
him
feel
better
it's
kill
or
be
killed
here
take
your
bloody
pick
maybe
it's
the
syphilis
talking
but
some
of
that
made
sense
i
made
these
points
earlier
but
fine
no
one
listens
to
me
fine
ok
but
someone
still
has
to
go
warn
the
dean
i'll
go
i
need
the
air
not
alone
i'll
go
me
too
sure
you're
up
to
it
oh
leave
that
one
he
looks
like
he's
ready
to
drop
any
minute
and
i
think
i
can
eat
someone
if
he's
already
dead
i'm
up
to
it
i'll
keep
on
looking
for
a
solution
yeah
guys
the
dean's
house
is
up
past
the
gym
and
hurry
dinner's
in
an
hour
hey
when
do
i
get
fed
later
i
hope
the
others
are
ok
you
know
what
happens
to
vampires
who
don't
get
to
feed
i
always
wondered
that
giles
plates
living
skeletons
mate
like
famine
pictures
from
those
dusty
countries
only
not
half
as
funny
you
can
have
gravy
that
has
blood
in
it
right
do
you
know
what
else
has
blood
in
it
blood
do
i
have
to
gag
you
because
i
am
not
gonna
listen
to
you
whine
all
the
way
through
my
dinner
it's
gonna
be
a
nice
quiet
civilized
suddenly
an
arrow
pierces
the
decorative
scarecrow
on
the
table
we
see
hus
in
the
window
with
a
bow
and
arrow
you
listen
maybe
i
wasn't
clear
before
about
how
terrible
we
all
feel
'cause
we're
trying
to
help
what's
going
on
it
isn't
working
uh
you
can
have
casinos
now
get
down
what
about
me
you
gonna
leave
me
here
like
this
hey
watch
the
heart

waste

hadn't
opened
the
conversation
with
'everybody

both
ears'
i
liked
his
wife

hey
gentle
ben
over
here
that's
for
giving
me
syphilis
what
happened
did
we
win
i
feel
lousy
turkey
came
out
rather
splendidly
oh
it
was
yummy
it's
justdid
you
see
me
2
seconds
of
conflict
with
an
indigenous
person
and
i
turned
into
general
custer
violence
does
that
instinct
takes
over
yeah
that's
the
fun
nobody
asked
you
oh
lay
off
you
all
had
a
fine
meal
but
mean
entire
siege
you'd
think
one
of
you
would
bleed
a
little
good
work
buffy
on
both
counts
thanks
well
you
know
you
should
be
very
pleased
wasn't
exactly
a
perfect
thanksgiving
i
don't
know
seemed
kinda
right
to
me
a
bunch
of
anticipation
a
big
fight
and
now
we're
all
sleepy
and
we
did
all
survive
i
guess
that
much
is
true
first
thanksgiving
on
my
own
and
we
all
got
through
it
and
you
know
what
i
think
my
syphilis
is
clearing
right
up
and
they
say
romance
is
dead
or
maybe
they
just
wish
it
well
maybe
we
started
a
new
tradition
this
year
maybe
not
but
at
least
we
all
worked
together
it
was
like
old
times
yeah
especially
with
angel
being
here
and
everything
