hi
angel
so
are
you
shopping
you're
probably
not
shopping
i
couldn't
sleep
vampires
probably
not

big
on
christmas
now
that
i
think
about
it
not
as
a
rule
but
you're
good
i'm
i'm
alright
you
yeah
yeah
i'm
good
i
um
i
was
just
getting
some
christmas
gifts
for
the
gang
um
i'd
better
go
before
the
magic
store
closes
angel
what
is
it
and
then
he
just
bailed
he
didn't
say
anything
he
just
took
off
it
was
so
weird
angel
weird
what
are
the
odds
do
you
think
something's
wrong
maybe
you
should
tell
giles
no
i
don't
wanna
bug
giles
he's
still
kinda
twitchy
when
it
comes
to
the
subject
of
angel
well
it
must
be
that
whole
angelkilledhisgirlfriendand
torturedhim
thing
hey
giles
is
pretty
petty
when
it
comes
to
stuff
like
that
xander
enough
okay
maybe
angel
just
has
the
holiday
blues
everybody
gets
'em
it's
just
so
frustrating
i'm
trying
to
do
the
right
thing
and
stay
away
from
him
and
get
over
it
and
then
boom
there
he
is
i
just
want
a
nice
quiet
christmas
vacation
so
you
doing
anything
special
tree
nog
roast
beast
just
me
and
mom
and
hopefully
an
excess
of
gifts
what
are
you
doing
for
christmas
being
jewish
remember
people
not
everybody
worships
santa
i
just
meant
for
vacation
mm
nothing
fun
oz
and
i
had
planned
but
i
guess
that's
off
well
i'll
be
enjoying
my
annual
christmas
eve
campout
see
i
take
my
sleeping
bag
outside
and
i
go
to
sleep
on
the
grass
sounds
fun
yeah
i
like
to
look
at
the
stars
you
know
feel
the
whole
nature
vibe
i
thought
you
slept
outside
to
avoid
your
family's
drunken
christmas
fights
yes
and
that
was
a
confidence
i
was
hoping
you
would
share
with
everyone
well
i'll
be
in
aspen
skiing
with
actual
snow
i
hear
that
helps
it
must
be
a
drag
to
be
stuck
here
in
sweatydale
but
i'm
thinking
of
you
okay
i'm
done
she
certainly
has
reverted
to
form
it's
not
her
fault
mm
after
what
happened
we
gotta
cut
her
some
slack
that's
the
christmas
spirit
hello
still
jewish
chanukah
spirit
i
believe
that
was
hey
hey
okay
the
thing
is
seeing
you
with
xander
it
was
well
i
never
felt
that
way
before
when
it
wasn't
a
full
moon
but
i
know
you
guys
have
a
history
but
it's
a
history
that's
in
the
past
well
ii
guess
most
history
is
in
the
past
but
it's
over
well
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
that
it
ever
will
be
between
you
two
oz
please
believe
me
this
is
what
i
do
know
i
miss
you
like
every
second
almost
like
i
lost
an
arm
or
worse
a
torso
so
i
think
i'd
be
willing
to
give
it
a
shot
really
yeah
do
you
want
us
to
to
hug
now
yeah
i'm
good
for
that
take
the
other
one
then
do
you
wanna
get
one
with
snow
on
it
be
very
christmasy
i
think
those
are
just
for
display

was
thinking
maybe
we
should
invite
faith
to
spend
christmas
eve
with
us
i
don't
know
faith
and
i
don't
really
hang
out
or
talk

really
wanna
let
her
spend
christmas
eve
all
by
herself
in
that
dingy
little
motel
room
you're
still
number
one
with
a
guilt
trip
mom

try
i'll
ask

a
doll
what

mean
he

with
a
bunch
of
girls
let's
split
up

minute
hello

phrase
strikes
me
as
rather
funny
'sorry
to
bother
me'
angel
i
need
your
help
and
the
funny
keeps
on
coming
i
understand
i
have
no
right
to
ask
for
it
but
there's
no
one
else
alright
i
i
can't
come
in
unless
you
invite
me
i'm
aware
of
that
come
in
i've

lately
about
the
past

it's
like
i'm
living
it
again
it's
it's
so
vivid
i
i
need
to
know
i
need
to
know
why
i'm
here
here
back
on
earth
i
should
be
in
a
demon
dimension
suffering
an
eternity
of
torture
i
don't
feel
particularly
inclined
to
argue
with
that
but
i'm
not
i
was
freed
and
i
don't
understand
why
knowing
why
you
were
back
would
give
you
peace
of
mind
it
might
you
think
that's
something
you
ought
to
have
because
sir

be
blunt
the
last
time
you
became
complacent
about
your
existence
turned

a
dream
about
angel
i
was
in
angel's
dream
i'm
not
sure
that's
giles
there
was
stuff
in
this
dream
that
i
couldn't
possibly
know
about
it
was
angel's
past
he
was
dreaming
it
and
somehow
i
got
sucked
in
there's
something
wrong
with
him
i
know
i've
seen
him
he
wanted
to
know
why
he
was
back
is
there
a
way
for
us
to
find
that
out
uh
possibly
ii've
been
looking
well
let
me
look
too
i'm
not
seeing
him
anymore
i'm
trying
to
put
all
this
behind
me
and
i'm
not
gonna
be
able
to
as
long
as
we're
both
doing
guest
spots
in
each
other's
dreams
so
we'll
help
him
yes
where
do
we
start
look
i'm
aware
i
haven't
been
the
mostest
best
friend
to
you
when
it
comes
to
the
whole
angel
thing
and
um
i
don't
know
maybe
i
finally
got
the
chanukah
spirit
well
we
start
not
surprisingly
with
research
xander
um
the
black
chronicles
and
uh
buffy
the
diary
of
lucious
temple
an
acolyte
of
acathla
expert
on
demons
you
can
skip
the
passages
on
his
garden
unless
you're
keen
on
growing
heartier
beets
are
you
sure
this
is
how
you
wanna
spend
your
christmas
vacation
yeah
this
is
actually
the
most
exciting
thing
i've
got
planned
who
else
can
claim
that
pathetic
a
social
life
hey
guys
what
are
we
doing
he's
gonna
come
over
on
christmas
eve
'cause
my
parents
are
out
of
town
we're
gonna
watch
videos
that's
good
right
you
guys
are
back
it's
good
it's
perfect
in
an
awkward
uncomfortable
sort
of
way
i
just
don't
know
how
to
make
oz
trust
me
xander
has
a
piece
of
you
that
oz
just
can't
touch
i
guess
now
it's
just
about
showing
oz
that
he
comes
first
i
guess
thanks
hey
he
likes
beets
i
read
that
one
already
we're
not
getting
any
closer
the
thing
i
remember
most
was
thinking
how
artful
it
was
in
the
dark
they
looked
just
like
they
were
sleeping
it
wasn't
until
i
bent
down
and
kissed
them
good
night
that
i
felt
how
cold
they
were
you
grabbed
me
and
i
thought
who
would
go
to
so
much
trouble
to
arrange
them
like
that
but
you
see
that's
what
makes
you
different
than
other
beasts
they
kill
to
feed
but
you
took
more
kinds
of
pleasure
in
it
than
any
creature
that
walks
or
crawls
oh
god
yeah
cry
out
make
a
scene
i
was
to
be
married
that
week
but
then
as
i
recall
you
knew
that
it
wasn't
me
it
wasn't
you
a
demon
isn't
a
man
i
was
a
man
once
oh
yes
and
what
a
man
you
were
a
drunken
whoring
layabout
and
a
terrible
disappointment
to
your
parents
i
was
young
i
never
had
a
chance
to
to
die
of
syphilis
you
were
a
worthless
being
before
you
were
ever
a
monster
stop
it
stop
i
don't
wanna
hurt
you
angel
but
you
have
to
understand
cruelty's
the
only
thing
you
ever
had
a
true
talent
for
that's
not
true
shh
rest
rest
you
mistake
it
for
a
curse
angel
but
it's
not

your
destiny

show
you

show
you
you
want
her
no

what
you
want

all
that
frustration
and
all
that
guilt
into
her
and
you'll
be
free
no
you
can't
live
for
eternity
with
all
that
pain

is
what
you
are

a
few
things
you

from
the
underground

so
nice

cool

nice
cool
waste
of
time

a
start
sure
in
a
town
with
fourteen
million
square
miles
of
sewer
plus
a
lot
of
natural
cave
formations
and
a
gateway
to
hell
i
don't
know
what
to

the
best
plan
is
to
deck
the
halls
with
boughs
of
holly
look
we'll
catch
the
bad
guys
sooner
or
later
willow
i
got
videos

oz
isn't
sure
what
to
make
of
this
and
looks
at
willow
she
smiles
back
at
him
too
much
of
anything
is
not
good
for
you

ever
have
that
dream
where

middle
of

just
need

you're

the
plan

it'll

'a
child
shall
be
born
of
man
and
goat
and
have
two
heads
and
the
first
shall
speak
only
in
riddles'

like
this
stuff

like
reading
the
sun

more
posturing
i'm
afraid
um
'for
they
are
the
harbingers
of
death
nothing
shall
grow
above
or
below
them
no
seed
shall
flower
neither
in
man
nor'
they're
rebels
and
they'll
never
ever
be
any
good
nothing
specific
about
their
haunts
let
me
see
that
'the
harbingers
of
death
nothing
shall
grow
above
or
below'

is
suddenly
lost

even
conceive
the
first
evil

am

thing

darkness

sunrise
long
before

time
to
explain
this
you
just
have
to
trust
me
that
thing
that
was
haunting
you

wasn't
haunting
me
it
was
showing
me

you
what
i
am

i
wanted
to
know
why
i
was
back

some
great
evil

credit
for
bringing
you
back
and
you
buy
it
you
just
give
up
i
can't
do
it
again

have
to
get
inside

me
to
kill
you

were
in
the
dream

me
to
lose
my
soul
in
you
and
become
a
monster
again
i
know
what
it
told
you
what
does
it
matter
because
i
wanted
to
because
i
want
you
so
badly
i
want
to
take
comfort
in
you
and
i
know
it'll
cost
me
my
soul
and
a
part
of
me
doesn't
care
look
i'm
weak
i've
never
been
anything
else
it's
not
the
demon
in
me
that
needs
killing
buffy
it's
the
man
you're
weak
everybody
is
everybody
fails
maybe
this
evil
did
bring
you
back
but
if
it
did
it's
because
it
needs
you
and
that
means
that
you
can
hurt
it
angel
you
have
the
power
to
do
real
good
to
make
amends
but
if
you
die
now
then
all
that
you
ever
were
was
a
monster
angel
please
the
sun
is
coming
up
just
go
i
won't
what
do
you
think
this
is
simple
you
think
there's
an
easy
answer
you
can
never
understand
what
i've
done
now
go
you
are
not
staying
here
i
won't
let
you
i
said
leave
oh
my
god
no
no
am
i
a
thing
worth
saving
huh
am
i
a
righteous
man
the
world
wants
me
gone
what
about
me
i
love
you
so
much
and
i
tried
to
make
you
go
away
i
killed
you
and
it
didn't
help
and
i
hate
it
i
hate
that
it's
so
hard
and
that
you
can
hurt
me
so
much
i
know
everything
that
you
did
because
you
did
it
to
me

i
wish
that
i
wished
you
dead
i
don't
i
can't
buffy
please
just
this
once
let
me
be
strong
strong
is
fighting
it's
hard
and
it's
painful
and
it's
every
day
it's
what
we
have
to
do
and
we
can
do
it
together
but
if
you're
too
much
of
a
coward
for
that
then
burn
if
i
can't
convince
you
that
you
belong
in
this
world
then
i
don't
know
what
can
but
do
not
expect
me
to
watch
and
don't
expect
me
to
mourn
for
you
because
and
while
most
of
southern
california
is
enjoying
a
balmy
christmas
an
extreme
cold
front
has
sprung
up
out
of
nowhere
around
sunnydale
where
they
are
reporting
heavy
snowfall
for
the
first
time
in
well
ever
sunnydale
residents
shouldn't
expect
to
see
the
sun
at
all
today
that
cold
front
isn't
going
anywhere
with
temperatures
in
the
high
30s
means
you
better
bundle
up
if
you're
planning
to
go
outside
and
enjoy
the
change
in
the
weather
