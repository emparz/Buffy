women

think
of
her
i
haven't
really
thought
about
what
i
think
of
her
a
girl
that
cute
in
the
face
and
you
form
no
opinion
no
i
mean
she's
all
right
i
guess
she's
just
kind
of
i
don't
know
peculiar
peculiar
hi
hey
graham
what
do
you
think
of
the
blonde
chick
mattressable
n'est
pas
riley's
not
down
doesn't
like
her
i
don't
dislike
her
she
just
she
never
feels
like
she's
really
there
when
you
talk
to
her
i
like
girls
i
can
get
a
grip
on
i
bet
you
do
not
that
way
just
a
little
less
ready
for
takeoff
all
the
time
there's
definitely
something
off
about
her
maybe
she's
canadian
didn't
she
go
out
with
parker
abrams
for
about
30
seconds
abrams
yeah
there's
a
sign
of
good
taste
ok
but
you've
got
to
admit
she's
a
major
league
hottie
well
i'm
not
denying
she's
easy
on
the
eyes
i'm
just
saying
buffy
spills
both
drink
and
yogurt
on
the
floor
would
you
really
want
to
go
out
with
her
hell
yes
i
bet
a
lot
of
guys
would
like
to
get
their
hands
on
her
slayer
i'll
kill
you
not
so
tough
i
kill
slayer
well
based
on
buffy's
description
i
believe
the
men
that
we're
after
look
something
like
um
like
this
the
latest
in
fall
fascism
i
like
it
a
bit
full
in
the
hips
for
my
taste
but
giles
oh
i
think
we
can
safely
assume
they're
human
so
um
no
research
needed
no
studying
damn
next
thing
they'll
tell
me
is
i'll
have
to
eat
jelly
doughnuts
or
sleep
with
a
supermodel
to
get
things
done
around
here
i
ask
you
how
much
can
one
man
give
not
too
much
i'm
afraid
um
once
again
i'd
say
that
you
and
i
will
not
be
needed
to
help
buffy
really
really
well
how
about
this
we
whip
out
the
ouija
board
light
a
few
candles
summon
some
ancient
unstoppable
evil
mayhem
mayhem
mayhem

kick
its
ass

slayer
and
the
next
thing

the
slayer
i

she
took
apart
my
crew

led
me

riley
i
notice
you
left
off
a
name
today
in
roll
call
osbourne
daniel
osbourne
oz
he's
not
in
this
class
anymore
i
hear
he
dropped
out
oh
well
you
heard
way
wrong
then
i
mean
he's
not
gone
hehe
left
temporarily
to
work
out
a
few
things
i
know
that
sounds
lame
in
its
vagueness
but
i
assure
you
oz
will
be
back
not
to
my
class
he
won't
an
educated
guess
you
know
the
rules
you
know
i
hate
exceptions
and
yet
somehow
you
feel
your
exception
is
exceptional
oh
but
walsh
it
is
to
you
but
since
i'm
neither
a
freshman
nor
a
narcissist
i
have
to
consider
the
whole
class
if
your
friend
can't
respect
my
schedule
i
think
it's
best
he
not
come
back
you
know
for
someone
who
teaches
human
behavior
you
might
try
showing
some
it's
not
my
job
to
coddle
my
students
you're
right
a
human
being
in
pain
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
job
i
like
her
really
you
don't
think
she's
a
little
peculiar
here
we
go
gear
for
tonight
if
some
commando
squads
are
out
there
fully
loaded
these
babies
might
give
us
the
edge
we'll
need
that's
a
very
impressive
array
where'd
it
all
come
from
uh
requisitioned
it
back
when
i
was
a
military
guy
that
was
2
years
ago
you
still
100
are
you
kidding
i
put
the
semper
in
semper
fi
i
might
not
be
able
to
assemble
an
m16
blindfolded
like
i
used
to
or
pass
weapons
drill
from
the
mobile
infantry
might
as
well
face
it
right
now
i
don't
have
the
technical
skills
to
join
the
swiss
army
and
all
those
guys
ask
you
to
do
is
uncork
a
couple
of
sassy
cabernets
well
i'm
sure
you'll
be
ready
when
the
time
comes
oh
fear
not
hand
to
hand
i'm
still
the
man
whoever
these
guys
trained
with
i'm
sure
they're
not
ready
to
deal
with
mother
xander
yes
mom
i
made
up
a
nice
fruit
punch
for
you
and
your
friend
would
you
boys
like
some
is
it
uh
raspberry
fruit
punch
so
she
says
'you
teach
human
behavior
maybe
you
ought
to
show
some'
forrest
oh
you're
lying
she
says
that
to
walsh
hope
to
die
doesn't
lack
for
guts
you've
got
to
give
her
that
yeah
but
she's
nuts
oh
come
on
like
you
never
wanted
to
tell
the
professor
off
hey
parker
forrest
what's
up
man
what's
the
scoop
on
buffy
summers
is
she
cool
buffy
yeah
she's
all
right
i
guess
i
mean
kind
of
whiney
how's
that
well
you
know
clingy
i
mean
we
got
a
little
physical
uh
well
fully
physical
and
then
she's
all
over
me
you
know
like
we're
betrothed
or
something
no
but
fun
was
had
yeah
oh
yeah
the
word
is
stamina
i
mean
definitely
a
bunny
in
the
sack
but
later
on
well
you
know
the
difference
between
a
freshman
girl
and
a
toilet
seat
a
toilet
seat
doesn't
follow
you
around
after
you
use
it
i
can't
believe
that
i
did
that
welcome
to
the
club
do
you
have
any
idea
how
much
trouble
you
could
have
gotten
into
if
parker
reported
you
graham
he
won't
he's
too
embarrassed
i
hit
him
what
the
hell
for
hehe
was
just
being
so
crude
please
you've
heard
me
say
much
grosser
things
than
that
and
most
of
those
are
about
your
own
mother
what
is
it
i
just
didn't
like
hearing
him
talk
about
buffy
that
way
i
think
i
well
i
guess
i
like
her
you're
kind
of
like
a
moron
so
you
you
knew
that
i
had
feelings
for
her
everybody
knows
man
oh
she's
peculiar
dead
giveaway
buddy
i'm
always
the
last
to
know
so
whatcha
gonna
do
well
i
guess
i'm
gonna
go
see
a
girl
sorry
can't
stay
got
to
go
see
a
girl
let
me
out
bit
busy
right
now

know
where
the
exit
is
you
spring
me
you're
free
you
don't
you're
dead
hurry
hurry
this
way
new
plan
we
split
up
you
go
that
way
he
shoves
the
vampire
into
the
ops
guys
and
flees
come
in
oh
riley
hi
hi
gee
i
hope
i'm
not
interrupting
anything
really
depressing
what's
up
right
to
the
point
ok
i
was
thinking
of
asking
out
buffy
she's
not
here
i
know
see
i
don't
know
that
much
about
buffy
but
i'm
interested
in
what
she
likes
and
so
far
well
the
only
thing
that
i
know
she
likes
is
you
whatwhat
do
you
want
me
to
do
just
tell
me
something
anything
just
give
me
a
clue
to
here
let
me
help
you
with
that
just
something
that
will
start
us
talking
you
know
i'm
thinking
that
how
'bout
them
broncos
won't
really
cut
it
ok
say
that
i
help
and
you
start
a
conversation
it
goes
great
you
like
buffy
she
likes
you
you
spend
time
together
feelings
grow
deeper
and
one
day
without
even
realizing
it
you
find
you're
in
love
time
stops
and
it
feels
like
the
whole
world's
made
for
you
two
and
you
two
alone
until
the
day
one
of
you
leaves
and
rips
the
stillbeating
heart
from
the
other
who's
now
a
broken
hollow
mockery
of
the
human
condition
yep
that's
the
plan
i
figured
it
was
oh
look
if
you
want
to
tell
me
to
go
to
hell
that's
ok
maybe
this
is
the
last
thing
you
want
to
talk
about
i
just
feel
that
well
i've
never
courted
anyone
like
buffy
before
i
don't
think
i've
ever
met
anyone
like
buffy
before
why
should
i
trust
you
just
sort
of
hoping
you'd
think
i
have
an
honest
face
i've
seen
host
faces
before
they
usually
come
attached
to
liars
all
right
i
guess
i'm
not
gonna
win
here
and
i
appreciate
you
wanting
to
protect
your
friend
i
guess
uh
she
kind
of
brings
that
out
in
people
she
likes
cheese
what
well
i'm
not
saying
it's
the
key
to
her
heart
but
buffy
she
likes
cheese
that's
a
start
she
has
a
stuffed
piggy
named
mr
gordo
loves
ice
capades
without
the
irony
and
she's
dragging
me
to
this
party
tonight
at
lowell
house
oh
you're
going
that's
my
house
i
live
there
well
it'll
give
you
a
chance
to
interact
but
don't
get
fresh
fresh
i
don't
even
know
if
we
like
each
other
yet
hey
does
she
ever
talk
about
me
like
has
she
ever
said
sorry
that's
discouraging
still
i
feel
like
i
have
a
fighting
chance
with
my
new
accomplice

not
your
accomplice

much
hostile
17
broke
restraints
at
exactly
247
pm
that's
a
big
head
start
gets
bigger
every
time
you
interrupt
me
it
was
bagged
and
tagged
locally
so
assume
it
knows
the
area
the
creature
has
every
advantage
right
now
fail
to
recapture
it
and
everything
we've
worked
for
the
initiative
itself
could
end
tonight
nobody's
failin'
on
my
watch
glad
to
hear
it
gentlemen
agent
finn
is
now
in
charge
of
this
operation
i'm
counting
on
you
riley
we
start
with
the
basic
mobilization
pattern
3
teams
sweep
and
search
just
like
practice
thorough
but
fast
cteam
take
the
campus
perimeter
make
sure
it
can't
leave
stake
it
if
you
gotta
but
only
as
a
last
resort
bteam
you're
going
down
tunnels
sewers
cemeteries
gates
and
miller
are
with
me
we
take
the
heart
of
campus
and
work
our
way
out
all
units
maintain
radio
contact
early
and
often
who's
got
questions
move
what
is
wrong
with
him
doesn't
spike
get
that
this
is
my
town
he's
resilient
and
it's
my
night
off
i'm
sure
he'd
pick
another
night
if
he
knew
you
were
busy
with
teutonic
boy
toy
what
is
that
supposed
to
mean
nothing
riley's
a
doof

not
teutonic
we
have
to
assume
that
spike's
main
target
is
you
buffy
fine
you
know
what
he's
worn
out
his
welcome
tonight
i
kill
him
you
have
a
plan
i
am
the
plan
if
spike
wants
me
i
go
alone
no
arguments
lead
him
away
from
the
popular
places
and
give
him
what
he
wants
oh
wait
wait
take
this
a
flare
gun

if
i
find
spike

staking
him

signaling
ships
at
sea
