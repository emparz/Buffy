we
haven't
been
properly
introduced
i'm
buffy
and
you're
history
poor
technique
prioritizing
sub
par
execution
was
adequate
but
a
bit
too
bloody
for
my
taste
giles
don't
mention
it
it
was
my
pleasure
to
make
the
world
safe
for
humanity
again
i'm
not
saying
that
your
methods
are
without
merit
it's
uh
y
you're
spending
too
much
time
and
energy
it
should
simply
be
plunge
and
move
on
plunge
and
hello
oh
that's
great
i
kill
'em
you
fence
their
stuff
what
is
it
i
don't
know
but
it
bothers
you
yes
well
i
i
thought
this
vampire
was
just
on
a
random
kill
but
it
may
be
something
else
something
big
yes
i'd
best
consult
my
books
'and
there
will
be
a
time
of
crisis
of
worlds
hanging
in
the
balance
and
in
this
time
shall
come
the
anointed
the
master's
great
warrior
and
the
slayer
will
not
know
him
will
not
stop
him
and
he
will
lead
her
into
hell'
as
it
is
written
so
shall
it
be
'five
will
die
and
from
their
ashes
the
anointed
shall
rise
the
brethren
of
aurelius
shall
greet
him
and
usher
him
to
his
immortal
destiny'
as
it
is
written
so
shall
it
be
'and
one
of
the
brethren
shall
go
out
hunting
the
night
before
and
get
himself
killed
because
he
couldn't
wait
to
finish
his
job
before
he
ate'
oh
wait
that's
not
written
anywhere
the
anointed
will
be
my
greatest
weapon
against
the
slayer
if
you
fail
to
bring
him
to
me
if
you
allow
that
girl
to
stop
you
here
endeth
the
lesson
that
symbol
on
the
ring
i
believe
it's
the
rune
for
fidelity
but
uh
it
doesn't
connect
with
any
of
the
sects
that
i've
studied
what
about
this
on
the
inside
it's
a
sun
and
three
stars
haven't
we
seen
that
somewhere
let
me
see
no
ii
don't
think
this
um
represents
any
wait
it's
right
here
sun
and
three
stars
yuch
check
these
guys
out
told
you
it
looked
familiar
oh
the
order
of
aurelius
yes
you're
right
ooo
two
points
for
the
slayer
while
the
watcher
has
yet
to
score
oh
owen
hi
what
do
you
want
a
book
oh
see
this
is
a
school
and
we
have
students
and
they
check
out
books
and
then
they
learn
things
i
was
beginning
to
suspect
that
was
a
myth
i
lost
my
emily
dickinson
it's
dumb
but
i
like
her
around
kind
of
a
security
blanket
i
have
something
like
that
well
it's
an
actual
blanket
uh
and
i
don't
really
carry
it
around
anymore
so
emily
dickens
huh
she's
great
dickinson
she's
good
also
poetry
i
didn't
think
i'd
find
you
here
w
why
not
i
i
didn't
mean
i
mean
i
think
you
can
read
thanks
but
you
don't
seem
bookwormy
the
type
of
person
to
lock
themselves
in
a
dark
room
with
a
lotta
musty
old
books
oh
and
i've
offended
you
no
no
i'm
just
surprised
you
gave
any
thought
to
what
i'm
like
you
shouldn't
be
oh
well
i
love
books
i
mean
i
really
love
books
what's
this
not
this
one
this
one
she
doesn't
love
oh
emily
dickinson
we're
both
fans
yes
uh
she's
quite
a
good
poet
i
mean
for
a
a
girl
for
an
american
i'll
uh
see
you
in
math
if
i
open
my
eyes
at
some
point
cool
the
order
of
aurelius
is
a
very
old
and
venerated
sect
if
they're
here
it's
for
a
good
reason
that
was
owen
yes
i
remember
do
you
have
any
more
copies
of
emily
dickinson
i
need
one
buffy
while
the
mere
fact
of
you
wanting
to
check
out
a
book
would
be
grounds
for
a
national
holiday
i
think
we
should
focus
on
the
problem
at
hand
right
i'm
sorry
you're
right
vampires
oh
does
this
outfit
make
me
look
fat
owen
thurman
was
talking
to
you
it's
all
true
wow
he
hardly
talks
to
anyone
he's
solitary
mysterious
he
can
brood
for
forty
minutes
straight
i've
clocked
him
he
was
so
nice
it
was
eerie
what
did
you
guys
have
to
talk
about
emily
dickinson
he
reads
emily
dickinson
he's
sensitive
yet
manly
well
wait

never
even
read
her
you
vixen
has
anybody
given
any
thought
to
what
this
green
stuff

avoiding
the
subject

think
it's
kale
or
possibly
string
cheese
so
buffy

the
slaying
go
last
night
xander
i
mean
how'd
the
laying

some
new
hoidytoidy
vampire
sect
in
town
that's
bad
well
hey
they're
bringing
in
the
muchneeded
tourist
dollars
ooo
look
at
mr
excitement

all
alone
maybe
somebody
should
sit
with
him
mm
just
to
be
polite
good
luck
okay

just
happened
look
an
empty
seat
ooo

thanks
boy
cordelia's
hips

i
thought
eh

least

to
eat
your
soylent
green
owen
a
bunch
of
us
are
loitering
at
the
bronze
tonight

gonna
be
there

besides

she
uh
she
doesn't
like
fun
how
'bout
we
meet
there
at
eight
yeah
eight
there
it's
not
that
big
a
deal
it's
just
a
bunch
of
people
getting
together
it's
a
very
big
deal
it's
not
it
is
tell
her
i'm
afraid
it's
very
big
thank
you
what
are
you
talking
about
what
are
you
talking
about
boys
yes
well
i'm
talking
about
trouble
a
violent
and
disturbing
prophecy
is
about
to
be
fulfilled
the
order
of
aurelius
you
were
spot
on
about
the
connection
who's
that
well
ii
don't
know
exactly
aaaa
warrior
but
but
it
says
he
will
rise
from
the
ashes
of
the
five
on
the
evening
of
the
thousandth
day
after
the
advent
of
septus
well
we'll
be
ready
whenever
it
is
which
is
tonight
tonight
okay
not
okay
it
can't
be
tonight
my
calculations
are
precise
nuh
they're
bad
calculations
bad
buffy
has
a
really
important
date
owen
alright
ii'll
just
jump
in
my
time
machine
go
back
to
the
twelfth
century
and
ask
the
vampires
to
postpone
their
ancient
prophecy
for
a
few
days
while
you
take
in
dinner
and
a
show
okay
at
this
point
you're
abusing
sarcasm
buffy
this
is
no
ordinary
vampire
but
we
have
to
stop
him
before
he
reaches
the
master
but
cute
guy
teenager
postpubescent
fantasies
those
will
just
have
to
be
put
on
hold
the
dark
forces
are
aligning
against
us
and
we
have
a
chance
to
beat
them
back
tonight
we
go
into
battle
perhaps
i
miscalculated
i'm
thinking
yes
well
you
know
what
they
say
90
of
the
vampire
slaying
game
is
is
waiting
you
couldn't
have
told
me
that
90
ago
well
we
we've
certainly
waited
here
long
enough
besides
there
aren't
any
fresh
graves
who's
gonna
rise
apparently
no
one
tonight
then
i
can
bail
i
can
go
to
the
bronze
and
find
owen
oh
very
well
then
follow
your
hormones
if
you
want
but
i
assume
i
don't
have
to
warn
you
about
the
hazards
of
becoming
personally
involved
with
someone
whose
unaware
of
your
unique
condition
yeah
yeah
i
read
the
back
of
the
box
if
your
identity
as
the
slayer
is
revealed
it
could
put
you
and
all
those
around
you
in
grave
danger
well
in
that
case
i
won't
wear
my
button
that
says
'i'm
the
slayer
ask
me
how'
good
night
'five
shall
die
and
from
their
ashes
the
anointed
shall
rise'
i
was
sure
it
was
tonight
i
went
on
an
airplane
a
pale
horse
emerged
with
death
as
its
rider
you
will
be
judged
you
will
be
judged
is
real
then
you
wake
up
shouting
some
familiar
name
it's
not
the
same
you're
just
a
girl
just
a
girl
who
knows
no
shame
whose
desperate
pace
has
lost
its
taste
a
neverending
darkness
weighs
i
can't
avoid
i
can't
complain
i
know
exactly
who's
to
blame
the
girl
who
shares
my
that
day's
gonna
bring
fire
fire
comin'
down
judgment
don't
think
you're
ready
ready
to
look
upon
him
if
there's
sin
in
there
there's
sin
all
around
it's
a
liquid
on
that
day
there
won't
be
anybody
tellin'
us
what
to
do
or
why
we're
doin'
it
you
can't
prepare
on
that
day
hey
you
gotta
sit
down
okay
are
you
willing
to
stand
with
the
righteous
is
everyone
okay
are
you
all
right
can
you
move
so
you
just
went
home
what
was
i
supposed
to
do
say
to
owen
'sorry
i
was
late
i
was
sitting
in
a
cemetery
with
the
librarian
waiting
for
a
vampire
to
rise
so
i
could
prevent
an
evil
prophecy
from
coming
to
pass'
xander
or
flat
tire
i
can't
take
this
anymore
i
feel
like
everyone
is
staring
at
me
the
big
hideous
dateless
monster
what
yeah
that's
right
i
have
no
life
c'mon
nothin'
to
see
here
pal
move
it
along
you're
acting
a
little
overly
aren't
you
i
mean
you
could
have
any
guy
in
school
he's
not
any
guy
he's
more
oweny
sure
he's
got
a
certain
owenosity
but
that's
not
hard
to
find
i
mean
a
lotta
guys
read
i
can
read
hey
buffy
owen
oh
look
it's
owen
buffy
and
owen
and
xander
that'd
be
me
wwhere
were
you
last
night
oh
well
um
my
watch
broke
and
we
don't
have
any
clocks
in
our
house
and
so
i
didn't
know
what
time
it
was
or
even
what
day
it
was
i
thought
i
was
the
only
one
that
happened
to
how
'bout
we
try
it
again
for
tonight
i'll
even
lend
you
my
watch
tonight
yyou
and
me
well
we
could
invite
the
chess
club
but
they
drink
and
they
start
fights
oh
no
it's
just
well
i
sort
of
heard
that
you
and
cordelia
were
somewhat
all
over
each
other
a
little
i
danced
with
her
a
couple
of
times
oh
well
let's
see
if
i
rearrange
that
and
i
push
that
to
n
sure
tonight'll
work
great
i'll
pick
you
up
at
seven
um
seven
that's
when
the
little
hand's
there
oh
between
the
six
and
the
eight
um
i'll
see
you
then
tonight
isn't
that
so
what
me
and
owen
yeah
so
it
is
it
sure
is
so
hey
how's
it
going
uh
alright
that's
great
i
see
we're
still
working
on
that
anointed
one
problem
that'll
probably
take
you
a
few
days
right
i
mean
that's
one
obscure
prophecy
well
yes
there
are
a
few
interpretations
so
tonight's
looking
slow
right
probably
best
to
relax
and
regroup
no
big
disasters
coming
that
is
so
good
i
will
see
you
tomorrow
then
bye
she
is
the
strangest
girl
you
have
done
well
everything
is
in
place
when
this
night's
work
is
done
i
will
have
a
mighty
ally
i'll
be
one
step
closer
to
freeing
myself
from
this
mystical
prison
i've
been
trapped
down
here
so
long
i've
nearly
forgotten
what
it's
like
on
the
surface
well
there'll
be
time
enough
to
remember
when
i
rule
it
if
she
tries
to
stop
you
kill
her
give
your
own
lives
but
do
not
fail
to
bring
the
anointed
i
know
you
won't
disappoint
me
bug
pick
okay
do
i
wanna
appear
shy
coy
and
naive
or
unrestrained
insatiable
and
aggressive
uh
y'know
owen
is
a
little
home
spun
he
probably
doesn't
like
that
overly
assertive
look
oh
hey
here's
something
a
nice
comfy
overcoat
and
a
ski
cap
the
ear
flaps
will
bring
out
your
eyes
maybe
i
should
mix
and
match
okay
guy's
opinion
which
one
do
you
think
owen
will
like
better
the
red
or
the
peach
oh
you
mean
for
kissing
you
and
then
telling
all
his
friends
how
easy
you
are
so
the
whole
school
loses
respect
for
you
and
then
talks
behind
your
back
the
red's
fine
thanks
i'll
go
with
the
peach
here
put
this
on
you're
not
bothering
me
so
where's
he
taking
you
oh
i
don't
know
where
do
you
suppose
young
kids
go
on
dates
these
days
well
i
read
somewhere
once
that
sometimes
they
go
to
movies
movies
interesting
and
i
saw
on
tv
once
a
bunch
of
people
our
age
went
to
a
party
wow
i
never
knew
being
a
teenager
was
so
full
of
possibilities
that's
owen
that's
giles
we
need
to
talk
buffy's
not
home
my
calculations
may
not
have
been
as
far
off
as
i
thought
'five
die
in
van
accident'
out
of
the
ashes
of
five
shall
rise
the
one
that's
the
prophecy
five
people
have
died
in
a
car
crash
i
know
it
doesn't
quite
follow
but
but
it's
worth
investigating
look
among
the
dead
was
andrew
borba
whom
the
police
sought
for
questioning
in
a
double
murder
now
he
may
be
the
anointed
one
the
the
bodies
have
been
taken
to
to
sunnydale
funeral
home
wwe
can
giles
why
do
you
wanna
hurt
me
i
beg
your
pardon
hey
uh
hi
you
have
a
date
yes
but
i
will
return
those
overdue
books
by
tomorrow
wait
you're
not
getting
off
that
easily
man
you
really
care
about
your
work
uh
owen
yeah
a
couple
of
things
about
tonight
another
date
don't
you
ever
do
anything
else
this
is
the
first
date
there's
never
been
a
date
okay
this
is
my
maiden
voyage
what
she
doesn't
like
to
dance
well
it's
a
little
too
late
to
do
anything
about
that
uh
you
should
probably
know
that
buffy
doesn't
like
to
be
kissed
actually
she
doesn't
like
to
be
touched
xander
as
a
matter
of
fact
don't
even
look
at
her
we
don't
even
know
if
this
is
anything
no
we
don't
and
i
haven't
had
a
day
off
in
a
while
true
and
a
cranky
slayer
is
a
careless
slayer
buffy
maintaining
a
normal
social
life
as
a
slayer
iiis
problematic
at
best
this
is
the
90's
the
1990's
in
point
of
fact
and
i
can
do
both
clark
kent
has
a
job
i
just
wanna
go
on
a
date
well
i
i
suppose
it
was
a
fairly
slim
lead
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
and
look
i
won't
go
far
okay
if
the
apocalypse
comes
beep
me
is
everything
cool
all
set
yes
and
uh
you'll
face
a
pretty
hefty
fine
in
the
morning
well
bye
don't
wait
up
is
something
going
on
oh
uh
probably
not
no
i
uh
i
suppose
i'll
just
uh
go
to
the
funeral
home
in
case
just
see
if
anything
comes
up
this
is
bad
i
wish
it
was
just
bad
we
should
go
along
yeah
you're
right
i
don't
trust
that
owen
guy
it's
the
eyes
crazy
xander
we
should
go
with
giles
he
could
get
in
trouble
oh
he's
gone
uh
it's
he's
gonna
be
alright
he's
like
super
librarian
y'know
everyone
forgets
willow
that
knowledge
is
the
ultimate
weapon
i'll
be
right
along
'cause
baby
you're
so
strong
the
thing
about
emily
dickinson
i
love
is
is
she's
just
so
incredibly
morbid
a
lot
of
loss
a
lot
of
death
it
gets
me
with
a
lot
about
bees
for
some
reason
did
she
have
a
tragic
and
romantic
life
with
a
lotta
bees
quiet
kind
of
sequestered
and
uneventful

where
do
you

what
are
any
of
you

made
this
a
double
date
i
didn't
know
you
guys
were
seeing
each
other
oh
yeah
well
we
knew
it
would
happen
eventually
so
we
figured
hey
why
fight
it
and
you
guys
are
thinking
double
'cause
of
the
fun
and
you're
here
because
of
work
hey
maybe
we
should
all
go
somewhere
together
gee
that's
so
nice
of
you
to
ask
but
owen
and
i
were
well
sort
of
owen
and
i
you
know
what'd
be
cool
the
sunnydale
funeral
home
i've
always
wanted
to
go

funeral
home

that
sounds
kinda
cool
do
you
think
we
could
all
sneak
in
we
saw
some
guys
in
there
before
they
seemed
to
be
bite
me
she
looks
up
at
angel
he
gives
her
an
'i
told

were
going
to
the
funeral
home

i'll
tell
you
what
i'll
be
back
in
a
little
while

the
deal

when
you
said
i
was
like
two
different
people

one
of
them
has
to
go
but
the
other
one
is
having
a
really
really
good
time
and
will
come
back
i
promise
she's
the
strangest
girl
which
way
the
room's
around
back
damn
it
this
is
so
cool
uh
owen
you
can't
be
here
oh
and
i
suppose
you
guys
are
allowed
what
are
we
doin'
here
are
we
gonna
see
a
dead
body
possibly
several
guys
watch
him
is
she
mad
oh
she
just
wants
to
make
sure
there're
no
guards
so
we
don't
get
in
trouble
good
thinking
good
thinking
giles
giles
it
is
you
oh
good
what
happened
uh
two
more
of
the
brethren
came
in
here
they
came
after
me
but
i
was
more
than
a
match
for
them
meaning
i
hid
uh
this
uh
chap
was
good
enough
to
bunk
with
me
till
they
went
away
well
wwere
they
here
after
you
or
wwas
it
that
prophecy
thing
ah
well
that's
what
we
have
to
find
out
i
don't
know
what
these
brethren
mean
to
do
exactly
find
the
anointed
or
or
or
or
give
him
something
perhaps
uh
it's
all
all
very
vague
and
the
anointed
may
be
long
gone
but
he
may
not
be
we
must
find
out
okay
i
just
need
to
get
owen
and
the
others
out
of
harm's
way
first
owen
you
brought
a
date
i
didn't
bring
him
he
came
buffy
when
i
said
you
could
slay
vampires
and
have
a
social
life
i
didn't
mean
at
the
same
time
i
know
i'll
get
rid
of
him
yyou
can't
make
him
go
out
there
alone
we
don't
know
where
the
brethren
are
ii'll
just
no
no
giles
he
sees
you
he's
gonna
have
more
questions
than
he
already
does
right
now
i'll
take
care
of
it
is
everything
okay
it
is
and
we'll
be
leaving
we're
not
done
lookin'
around
yet
no
he's
right
so
let's
find
a
nice
safe
fun
room
to
look
around
in
we
tried
the
office
here
but
it's
locked
no
it's
not
well
i
don't
think
we'll
find
much
in
here
that's
the
plan
okay
what
i
have
to
go
now
um
to
the
bathroom
i
have
to
go
to
the
bathroom
if
you
hear
anything
like
a
security
guard
or
something
just
be
really
quiet
and
barricade
the
door
ewww
parts
keep
looking
he
must
be
here
somewhere
what
are
you
guys
doing
uh
just
in
case
oh
my
nothing
the
anointed
must
be
gone
i
guess
i
mean
this
is
where
they
keep
all
the
dead
bodies
right
mmhm
i
read
a
lot
about
death
but
but
i've
never
really
seen
a
dead
body
before
do
they
usually
move
i
have
been
judged
what's
goin'
on
oh
no
he
is
risen
in
me
he
fills
my
head
with
song
pork
and
beans
pork
and
beans
gimme
that
i
can
smell
you
you're
the
chaff
unblessed
i'll
suck
the
blood
from
your
hearts
he
says
i
may
he's
in
there
uh
go
get
out
she'll
be
okay
c'mon
shall
we
gather
at
the
river

beautiful
the
beautiful
river

coming
this
way
oh

is
too
much
what've
you
got
what
what'd
you
bring
do
you
have
a
stake
oh
uh

i
do
um
go
outside
and
make
sure
the
others
are
okay
buffy
somebody's
gotta
help
buffy
owen
they
told
me
about
you
while
i
was
sleeping
uh
why
does
he
hurt
me
buffy
no
did
you
see
that
he
tried
to
bite
me
what
a
sissy
no
dead
he
was
found
wanting
you
killed
my
date
buffy
owen's
jjust
give
her
a
sec
you
killed
my
date
your
turn
does
anyone
have
an
aspirin
or
sixty
owen
what
happened
to
that
guy
oh
we
scared
him
away
oh
good
'cause
y'know
i
would've
i
know
here
i'm
sure
this
isn't
exactly
what
you
had
in
mind
for
our
first
date
yeah
i
was
hoping
maybe
we'd
finish
at
ben
jerry's
we
still
could
no
i
i
i
think
i'll
just
walk
home
i'll
get
you
there
no
i'll
i'll
go
it
alone
we'll
make
sure
he
gets
home
safely
buffy
if
i
might
uh
don't
well
did
owen
say
anything
about
me
on
the
way
home
oh
you
mean
specifically
about
you
or
generally
iin
the
area
in
the
ballpark
any
sort
of
indication
well
in
that
case
no
but
he
was
pretty
incoherent
so
we
might've
missed
it
you
think
no
i
knew
it
i
totally
blew
it
last
night
no
see
what
you
need
is
a
guy
who
already
knows
your
deepest
darkest
secrets
and
still
says
'hey
i
like
that
girl'
someone
like
owen
well
heh
this
is
our
stop
hi
hi
this
is
going
well
i
don't
really
know
how
to
say
this
but
about
last
night
you
don't
even
have
to
i'm
sure
you
were
pretty
freaked
out
totally
and
i
was
wondering
when
i
could
see
you
again
um
that
was
my
hopeful
ear
could
you
repeat
that
i
think
you're
the
coolest
really
i
mean
last
night
was
incredible
i
never
thought
nearly
getting
killed
would
make
me
feel
so
alive
so
that's
why
you
wanna
be
with
me
oh
absolutely
when
can
we
do
something
like
that
again
something
like
like
walk
downtown
at
three
in
the
morning
aand
pick
a
fight
in
a
bar
how
about
tonight
tonight
would
be
not
a
workable
thing
did
i
just
say
that
tomorrow
then
ii'm
free
any
night
this
week
i'm
not
please
don't
take
this
personally
it's
not
you
it's
me
right
it's
you
and
i
was
kinda
hoping
that
maybe
you
and
i
could
still
be
i
i
get
it
you
just
wanna
be
friends
that'd
be
nice
friends
yeah
great
the
world
will
keep
on
turning
it'll
all
be
there
come
morning
so
tonight
yeah
great
let
the
sun
fall
down
all
around
you
i
was
ten
years
old
when
my
father
told
me
i
was
destined
to
be
a
watcher
he
was
one
and
his
uh
mother
before
him
and
i
was
to
be
next
were
you
thrilled
beyond
all
measure
no
i
had
very
definite
plans
about
my
future
i
was
going
to
be
a
fighter
pilot
or
possibly
a
grocer
well
uh
my
father
gave
me
a
very
tiresome
speech
about
uh
responsibility
and
sacrifice
sacrifice
huh
seems
like
a
nice
lad
yeah
but
he
wants
to
be
danger
man
you
xander
willow
you
guys
you
guys
know
the
score
you're
careful
two
days
in
my
world
and
owen
really
would
get
himself
killed
or
i'd
get
him
killed
or
someone
else
i
i
went
to
the
funeral
home
of
my
own
free
will
and
i
should've
been
there
buffy
i
blew
it
i
have
volumes
of
lore
of
prophecies
of
predictions
but
i
don't
have
an
instruction
manual
we
feel
our
way
as
we
go
along
and
i
must
say
as
a
slayer
you're
you're
doing
pretty
well
well
at
least
i
did
stop
that
prophecy
thing
from
coming
true
you
did
handily
no
more
anointed
one
and
i
would
imagine
the
master
wherever
he
is
is
having
a
fairly
bad
day
himself
'and
in
this
time
will
come
the
anointed
and
the
slayer
will
not
know
him
she
will
not
stop
him
and
he
will
lead
her
into
hell'
welcome
my
friend
