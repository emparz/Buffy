it's
about
power
who's
got
it
who
knows
how
to
use
it
so
who's
got
the
power
dawn
well
i've
got
the
stake
the
stake
is
not
the
power
but
he's
new
he
doesn't
know
his
strength
hhe
might
not
know
all
those
fancy
martial
arts
skills
they
inevitably
seem
to
pick
up
who's
got
the
power
he
does
never
forget
it
doesn't
matter
how
well
prepped
you
are
or
how
well
armed
you
are
you're
a
little
girl
woman
little
woman
i'm
taller
than
you
he's
a
vampire
ok
demon
preternaturally
strong
skilled
with
powers
no
human
could
possibly
ever—
excuse
me
i
think
i'm
stuck
you're
stuck
my
foot's
caught
on
a
root
or
something
and
i
don't
even
know
how
i
got
down
there
if
you
girls
could
just
give
me
a
hand
hm
so
he's
got
the
power
zip
it
i
really
appreciate
it
it's
just
it's
so
dark
and
i
don't
even
know
what
i'm
doing
here
whoa
ooh
thanks
that
was
a
help
unfortunately
it
was
the
last—
—thing
you'll
ever
do
listen
up
i'm
the
slayer
you
don't
want
to
get
into
it
with
me
you
want
blood
you
can
have
hers
power
he's
got
it
he's
going
to
use
it
you
don't
have
it
so
—
—use
that
perfect
buffy
it's
real
it's
the
only
lesson
dawn
it's
always
real
let
me
see
it's
nothing
it's
just
a
scrape
plus
i
had
a
plan
the
whole
time
really
yeah
i
planned
to
get
killed
come
back
as
a
vampire
and
bite
you
you
wanted
to
be
trained
well
just
the
next
time
when
you're
gonna
disa—
you
did
pretty
well
i
did
yeah
'cause
you
know
with
the
whole
rolling
thing
i
was
actually
using
his
strength
and
it
was
very
tai
chi
plus
i
nearly
got
the
heart
my
first
time
out
i
missed
the
heart
too
no
way
just
the
once
well
the
next
vampire
i
meet—
the
next
vampire
you
meet
you
run
away
i
just
wish
that
was
all
we
had
to
worry
about
vampires
demons
they're
nothing
compared
to
what's
coming
i
know
i
just
can't
believe
it's
back
believe
me
i
thought
i
was
long
past
it
i
guess
you
never
are
just
a
few
more
days
'til
it
starts
then
we'll
never
know
what's
coming
next
it
is
my
great
pleasure
and
privilege
to
announce
the
official
opening—on
the
very
ground
that
it
first
stood
upon—of
the
brand
new
state
of
the
art
sunnydale
high
that
doesn't
belong
there
no
it
doesn't
that's
the
flora
kua
alaya
a
native
of
paraguay
if
my
botany
serves
is
there
anything
you
don't
know
everything
about
synchronized
swimming
complete
mystery
to
me
yep
paraguay
where
does
it
come
from
paraguay
who
brought
it
through
the
earth
it's
all
connected
the
root
systems
the
moleculesthe
energy
everything's
connected
you
sound
like
miss
hartness
she's
taught
me
a
lot
then
why
aren't
you
in
your
lesson
sorry
it's
alright
she
was
just—
—afraid
yeah
they
all
are
the
coven
is—they're
the
most
amazing
women
i've
ever
met
but
there's
this
look
that
they
get
like
i'm
gonna
turn
them
all
into
bangers
and
mash
or
something
which
i'm
not
even
really
sure
what
that
is
they're
cautious
i
trust
you
understand
that
i
don't
have
that
much
power
i
don't
think
everything's
connected
you're
connected
to
a
great
power
whether
you
feel
it
or
not
well
you
should
just
take
it
from
me
you
know
we
can't
this
isn't
a
hobby
or
an
addiction
it's
inside
you
now
this
magic
you're
responsible
for
it
will
they
always
be
afraid
of
me
maybe
can
you
handle
it
i
deserve
a
lot
worse
i
killed
people
giles
i've
not
forgotten
when
you
brought
me
here
i
thought
it
was
to
kill
me
or
to
lock
me
in
some
mystical
dungeon
for
all
eternity
or—with
the
torture
instead
you
go
all
dumbledore
on
me
i'm
learning
about
magic
all
about
energy
and
gaia
and
root
systems
do
you
want
to
be
punished
i
wanna
be
willow
you
are
in
the
end
we
all
are
who
we
are
no
matter
how
much
we
may
appear
to
have
changed
dawn
xander's
here
just
a
minute
you're
going
to
be
late
i'm
comfortable
with
that
g'morning
well

made
cereal
ok

unconscionably
spiffy
client
meeting
how
exactly
do
you
make
cereal
ah

the
box
near
the
milk
i
saw
it
on
the
food
channel
want
something
i
ate
i'm
good
how
are
you
my
sister's
about
to
go
to
the
same
high
school
that
tried
to
kill
me
for
three
years
i
can't
change
districts
i
can't
afford
private
school
and
i
can't
begin
to
prepare
for
what
could
possibly
come
out
of
there
so
peachy
with
a
side
of
keen
that
would
be
me
well
here's
a
little
something
for
what
ails
ya
mmm
you
got
the
rest
take
a
look
hey
check
out
doubleo
xander
go
talk
with
your
mouth
full
i've
got
two
crews
working
on
this
diabolical
yet
lucrative
new
campus
one
here
finishing
the
science
building
and
one
here
reinforcing
the
gym
there
are
no
pentagrams
no
secret
passageways
everything's
up
to
code
and
safe
as
houses
nothing
creepy
strange
from
beyond
maybe
you're
just
paranoid
well
there
is
one
interesting
detail
i
managed
to
scare
up
the
plan
from
the
old
high
school
you
remember
the
very
center
of
sunnydale's
own
hell
mouth
under
the
library
right
so
i
lined
up
the
plans
new
and
old
and
right
exactly
where
the
library
was
we
now
have
principal's
office
so
the
principal's
evil
or
in
a
boatload
of
danger
well
the
last
two
principals
were
eaten
who
would
even
apply
for
that
job
guess
we'll
see
ooh
we
have
to
leave
though
you
have
everything
books
lunch
stakes
checked
thrice
did
you
give
her
the
no
i
was
saving
it
what
is
it
back
to
school
gift
it's
a
weapon
isn't
it
yes
it
is
i'm
gonna
take
her
to
class
have
a
look
around
ok
i'm
gonna
be
onsite
here
all
day
so
if
you
have
any
needs
now
remember
if
you
see
anything
strange
or
you
knowdead
i
got
it
and
stay
away
from
hyena
people
or
any
lizardtype
athletes
you
know
or
if
you
see
anyone
that's
invisible
hey
buffy
i
think
it's
pretty
safe
to
say
i'm
not
going
to
see
anybody
that's
invisible
you
know
you
could
still
drop
out
only
nerds
finish
high
school
you
know
i
don't
really
think
it's
fair
for
you
to
try
and
scare
me
on
my
first
day
of
high
school
'cause
it
is
so
redundant
the
place
is
evil
tough
to
let
'em
go

competitive
with
you
i
mean
there
was
that
thing
in
the
crimean
war
we
laugh
about
it
now
but
the
fact
is
i've
actually
always
looked
up
to
you
you
were
the
singlemost
hardcore
vengeance
demon
on
the
roster
and
everybody
knew
it
do
i
have
to
mention
mrs
cholgash
hmm
ha
good
times
and
then
you
lost
your
powers
it
happens
and
you
fell
for
this
xander
guy
it
was
a
glitch
a
summer
thing
i
am
so
back
in
the
vengeance
fold
no
deaths
no
eviscerations
you're
not
goading
women
into
anything
inventive
and
you're
not
delivering
when
it
is
i
don't
even
know—
waitress
downtown
wished
her
husband
was
a
frog
you
made
him
french
hmph
he's
smelly
and
with
a
little
mustache
she—
listen
anya
if
it
was
just
me—
what
do
you
mean
if
it
was
just
you
d'hoffrin
the
lower
beings
they're
all
feeling
the
heat
something's
rising
something
older
than
the
old
ones
and
everybody's
tail
is
twitching
this
is
a
bad
time
to
be
a
good
guy
well
what
is
this—an
intervention
shouldn't
all
my
demon
friends
be
here
sweetie
they
are
so
how's
it
looking
does
the
place
pass
inspection
oh
it's
great
if
you're
a
zombie
ghost
thing
so
school's
back
in
session
huh
seems
like
old
times
so
zombies
or
ghosts
i'm
not
sure
they
were
in
the
mirror
but
they
disappeared
um
but
they
touched
me
i
think
well
let's
just
start
with
dead
and
pissed
they
were
after
you
personally
they
talked
about
protecting
people
told
me
to
leave
no
damage
though
i
think
i
may
have
destroyed
dawn's
social
life
in
all
of
about
30
seconds
but
apart
from
that
no
ah
being
popular
isn't
so
great
or
so
i've
read
in
books
this
isn't
a
coincidence
you
know
the
school
being
rebuilt
it
means
something
as
in
what
could
i
borrow
a
pencil
thanks
a
lot
are
you
all
right
i'm
sorry
there
was
a
a
bee
it
flew
in
my
eye
i'm
very
allergic

think
it's
gone

i
go
to
the
bathroom

runs
in
the
family
whoa
ooh
sorry
miss
summers

didn't
know
you
were
still
about
uh
yeah
i
was
just
looking
for—
i
thought
in
general
it
was
customary
for
a
person
who's
graduated
to
um
you
know
go
somewhere
else
well
it's
a
new
campus
i'm
just
getting
to
know
it
you
know
make
sure
it's
safe
for
my
sister

someone
in
here
it's
only
me
no
it's
not
you
know
i
um
have
to
be
honest
i
actually
know
a
little
bit
more
about
you
than
i
let
on
before
isn't
that
interesting
oh
it
really
is
let's
get
you
out
of
here

can
get
some
air

dawn

pretty
creepy

kinda
sorta
think
i
will
was
there
a
pencil
involved
in
any—
oh
god
just
breathe
i
can't
god
just
breathe
what
happened
what
do
you
remember
we
were
talking
and
i
felt
i
felt
the
earth
it's
all
connected
it
is
but
it's
not
all
good
and
pure
and
rootsy
there's
deep
deep
black
there's
i
saw
i
saw
the
earth
giles
i
saw
its
teeth
the
hell
mouth
it's
gonna
open
it's
gonna
swallow
us
all
hey
hey

up
please

up
oh
oh
god
uh
are
you
ok
we
have
to
leave
you're
not
wrong
c'mon
there's
got
to
be
a
staircase
the
school
board
recommended
i
spend
a
little
time
reading
your
record
it's
um
quite
a
pageturner
kind
of
a
checkered
past
huh
more
like
a
plaid
kind
of
a
clan
tartan
of
badness
really
you
know
but
there
were
factors
what
did
you
see
when
i
found
you
in
the
stall
a
girl
she
said
she
died
here
and
that
everybody
dies
here
and
that
we
would
too
here
i
was
worried
about
not
fitting
in
who
are
you
who
are
you
are
you
dead
stop
saying
that
whoa
we're
not
dead
we
saw
creepy
dead
people
and
we're
just
trying
to
get
out
i
just
came
down
here
for
a
smoke
you
know
and
i
saw
it
was
a
janitor
he
was
yelling
at
me
i
thought
he
was
just
pissed
but
i
saw
him
in
the
light
wait
you
came
downstairs
where
man
i
got
no
clue
i
ran
away
like
a
girl
i
don't
know
this
place
at
all
ok
so
we
can
run
around
in
circles
or
do
you
really
think
you
can
run
away
it's
not
real
lesson
one
it's
always
real
i
tried
to
run
too
i
tried
to
scream
doesn't
matter
how
much
you
scream
nobody
ever
hears
you
hear
me
right
ooh
i
got
a
present
what
is
it
a
weapon
well
it's
clear
your
sister
looks
up
to
you
which
i
think
is
great
no
she's
much
much
worse
than
me
troublemaker
expulsion
is
really
the
only
way
to
go
you
know
or
you
can
suspend
her
for
three
years
well
how
'bout
we
give
her
a
chance
first
just
as
long
as
she
keeps
her
grades
up
and—
boy
that's
loud
that's
a
part
of
the
reason
we
don't
allow
cell
phones
in—
excuse
me
yeah
oh
sorry

dog
uh
dog
walker
three

great
personality

was
ripped
to

by
a
werewolf

that
why

find
a
way
upstairs
assuming

one
you
really
weren't
kidding

this
place
i
guess
it
hasn't
changed
i
don't
know
seems
smaller
you
guys
are
gonna
be
ok
school
is
intense
but
you'll
do
all
right
as
long
as
you're
careful
and
you
might
want
to
think
about
sticking
together
thank
you
yeah
i
mean
it
you
are
the
coolest
mom
ever
ok
come
on
we
still
have
a
few
more
classes
to
live
through
curiouser
and
curiouser
what
is
carlos
trejo
and
kit
holburn
right
possibly
the
only
two
students
in
this
school
whose
files
are
as
thick
as
yours
was
you
really
did
your
homework
didn't
you
i
was
looking
for
one
or
both
of
them
to
actually
implode
in
a
fearsome
way
right
before
midterms
and
now
i
see
that
you
got
'em
socializing
and
hugging
and
actually
if
i'm
not
mistaken
headed
to
class
well
we
shared
an
encounter
look
i
know
you're
probably
more
than
happy
to
get
out
of
this
place
but
i
gotta
tell
you
miss
summers
i
think
you
belong
here
hmm
new
listen
i
know
this
school's
reputation
what
you
think
i
got
this
job
based
on
seniority
we
got
a
lot
of
troubled
students
here
and
just
enough
money
to
keep
this
place
from
caving
in
yeah
you
might
need
a
little
extra
there
well
we
do
have
a
community
outreach
program
and
the
money
we
could
pay
you
wouldn't
even
fold
but
it
would
just
be
a
couple
of
days
a
week
are
you
asking
me
to
be
a
counselor
well
we
have
a
guidance
counselor
but
i
was
thinking
the
kids
could
use
someone
you
know
closer
to
their
age
who
still—
i'm
in
what
you
serious
you—you
did
hear
the
part
about
the
money
right
yeah
i
heard
my
schedule
might
be
a
little
funtastic
but
uh
i'll
work
it
out
i'd
like
to
keep
an
eye
on
this
place
well
that's
great
look
at
that
it's
not
even
noon
and
i've
already
bullied
my
first
family
member
into
helping
out
i'm
going
to
be
the
best
principal
ever
the
thing
isi
had
a
speech
i
learned
it
all
oh
god
she
won't
understand
she
won't
understand
of
course
she
won't
understand
sparky
i'm
beyond
her
understanding
she's
a
girl
sugar
and
spice
and
everythinguseless
unless
you're
baking
i'm
more
than
that
more
than
flesh
more
than
blood
i'm
you
know
i
honestly
don't
think
there's
a
human
word
fabulous
enough
for
me
oh
my
name
will
be
on
everyone's
lips
assuming
their
lips
haven't
been
torn
off
but
not
just
yet
that's
alright
though
i
can
be
patient
everything
is
well
within
parameters
she's
exactly
where
i
want
her
to
be
and
so
are
you
number
17
you're
right
where
you
belong
so
what'd
you
think
you'd
get
your
soul
back
and
everything'd
be
jim
dandy
soul's
slipperier
than
a
greased
weasel
why
do
you
think
i
sold
mine
well
you
probably
thought
that
you'd
be
your
own
man
and
i
respect
that
but
you
never
will
you'll
always
be
mine
you'll
always
be
in
the
dark
with
me
singing
our
little
songs
you
like
our
little
songs
don't
you
you've
always
liked
them
right
from
the
beginning
and
that's
where
we're
going
right
back
to
the
beginning
not
the
bang
not
the
word
the
true
beginning
the
next
few
months
are
going
to
be
quite
a
ride
and
i
think
we're
all
going
to
learn
something
about
ourselves
in
the
process
you'll
learn
you're
a
pathetic
schmuck
if
it
hasn't
sunk
in
already
look
at
you
trying
to
do
what's
right
just
like
her
you
still
don't
get
it
it's
not
about
right
not
about
wrong
it's
about
power
