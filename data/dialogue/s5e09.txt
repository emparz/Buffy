listen
you
two
i
know
this
creamed
spinach

promise

won't
be
offended
if
you
go
out
for
some
real
food
you
kidding
me
this
is
the
good
life
relaxing
in
bed
while
people
bring
you
food
on
trays
i
like
the
jello
help
yourself
there's
something
about
food
that
moves
by
itself
that
gives
me
the
heebiejeebies
it's
good
and
wiggly
this
girl
at
school
told
me
that
gelatin
is
made
from
groundup
cow's
feet
and
that
if
you
eat
jello
there's
some
cows
out
limping
with
no
feet
but
i
told
her
i'm
sure
they
kill
'em
before
they
take
off
their
feet
right
you're
the
one
who
insisted
on
teaching
her
to
talk

kriegel

my
girls
buffy

a
break
we

we
got
tons
to

soap
operas
to

and
trashy
magazines
to
read
and
an
adjustable
bed
to
fiddle
with
that
alone
will
keep
me
busy
for
four
hours
or

a
rough
night
i
just
did
two
of

was
pretty
cool
except
the
part
where
i
was
all
terrified
and
and
now
my
knees
are
all
dizzy
not
so
much
a
big
success
night
for
me
but
i
think
i
should
get
points
just
for
showing
up
unlike
some
riley
finn
who
shall
remain
unnamed
yes
that
was
disappointing
things
would
have
been
easier
if
he'd
been
here
oh
piffle
who
needs
him
when
i'm
dusting
two
at
a
ti
whoops
maybe
it
would've
been
good
if
he'd
shown
up
perhaps
he
forgot
care
package
special
delivery
for
the
summers
girls
now
let's
see
what
i
have
in
this
sack
of
mine

just
like
santa
claus
except
thinner
and
younger
and
female
and
well
jewish

is
an
extraspecial
gift
for
your
mom
that
i
know
she'll
need
a
beer
hat
see
iit's
got
cup
holders
and
a
straw
that
goes
directly
into
your
mouth
and
you
can
fill
it
with
other
stuff
than
beer
and
somehow
when
i
was
in
the
store
this
seemed
like
the
most
important
idea
and
now
there's
the
whole
part
where
i'm
crazy
it's
perfect
thank
you
willow
you're
very
sweet
now
let's
see

a
book
to
teach
her
to
break
things
by
looking
at

doing
world
war
one
now
the
last
exam
was
really
pretty
easy

be
no
hassle
to
make
it
up
buffy
i
don't
even
know
if
i'm
gonna
take
that
exam
i'd
rip
it

gonna
take
a
little

uh
i
should
have
told
you

the
thing

pressing
on
her
brain
sometimes
it
it
might
make
her
say
weird
things
does
she
know
she's
saying
them
not
really
it's
sort
of
like
a
flash
you
know
but
you
saw
her
two
seconds
afterward
she
was
normal
and
after
the
operation
no
more
pressing
she'll
be
all
normal
all
the
time

things
rough
at

to
love
to
look
up
at
them
when
i
was
little
they're
supposed
to
make
you
feel
all
insignificant
but
they
made
me
feel
like
like
i
was
in
space
part
of
the
stars
there's
canis
minor
and

and
cassiopeia
and
the
big
pineapple

it's
a
major
one

three
bright
stars
right
over
there
yeah
and
see
those
stars
along
there
that's
the
bottom
of
the
pineapple

big
hence
the
name
the
real
ones

made
sense
to
me
i
sort
of
have
my
own
teach
me

those
stars
over
there
short
man
looking
uncomfortable
they
both
giggle
uh
moose
getting
a
sponge

thathat
was
a
bit
of
a
stretch
you
do
it
what

you
call
mm
that
one
hmm
let's
see
a
huge
flaming
meteor
about
to
crash
into
something
i
know
what
i
said
i
saidi
said
i
won't
go
away
far
a
person
needs
to
respect
a
man
and
then
it
says
that
the
facts
says
he's
got
to
go
take
a
walk
and
get
some
fresh
air
and
find
some
fresh
spaces
and
some
fresh
space
and
needs
to
walk
to
get
to
get
where
he's
going
this
thing
doesn't
work
it
isn't
working
i'm
sure
they
heard
you
i
bet
it's
not
even
hooked
up
to
anything
just
like
the
push
buttons
at
the
crosswalk
that
are
supposed
to
make
the
signal
change
i'm
sure
someone's
on
what
the
push
buttons
aren't
hooked
up
to
anything
oh

him
buffy

all
of
us
my
mom
too

first
thing
i'd
recommend
i
can't
ii
can't
stay
here
waiting
for
two
days
for
this
operation
i
just
can't
it
makes
my
head
hurt
to
be
here

you
tell
that
joyce
there's
no
reason
to
get
upset
no
reason
to
get
upset
oh
right
sorry
i
must
just
think
there
is
because
of
my
brain
tumor
here
dawn
why
don't
you
get
something
from
the
machine
ii'm
sorry
i
said
that
i'm
just
tired
i
know
listen
doctor
i
don't
see
why
we
can't
take
her
home
you
know
just
until
ii
mean
wouldn't
it
be
better
for
her
to
rest
someplace
where
she
felt
safe
and
comfortable
even
if
it
would
mean
some
work
for
you
taking
care
of
her
oh
thank
god
i'll
do
it
anything
there
are
medications
to
administer
i'd
have
to
go
over
those
with
you
and
i'd
need
for
you
to
check
her
vitals
watch
her
pretty
closely
i'm
afraid
you
won't
get
a
lot
of
sleep
i'm
not
much
of
a
sleep
person
anyway
can
we
go
now
let's
go
now
oh
hold
on
lemme
get
all
the
medications
and
all
the
instructions
on
how
to
do
everything
she's
right
let's
do
this
right
we
don't
wanna
forget
anything
everyone
stay
close
i'm
glad
you
called
me
in
on
this
glad
you
answered
oh
yeah
i'm
sorry
about
last
time
heard
i
missed
out
on
some
fun
oh
yeah
fun
was
had
also
frolic
merriment
and
neardeath
hijinks
look
there
it
is
wow
we
have
meteorite
is
it
hot
'cause
uh
if
there's
radiation
you
could
like
go
all
sterile
no
it's
not
hot
it's
warm
and
broken
it's
sort
of
giles
hollow
yeah
so
uh
we're
all
thinking
the
same
thing
right
festive
pinata
delicious
candy
something
evil
crashed
to
earth
in
this
and
then
broke
out
and
slithered
away
to
do
badness
in
all
fairness
we
don't
really
know
about
the
slithered
part
oh
no
i'm
sure
it
frisked
about
like
a
fluffy
lamb
let's
look
around
maybe
we
can
figure
out
where
it
went
it
went
here
no
pulse
yep
the
space
lamb
got
'im
i
don't
see
any
marks
on
him
ii
know
him
he
he
was
at
the
hospital
a
mental
patient
they
released
him
today
uh
riley
what
are
you
doing
i'm
not
sure
there's
something
oh
that
might
be
toxic
don't
touch
it
oh
yeah
touching
it
was
my
first
impulse
luckily
i've
moved
on
to
my
second
which
involves
dryheaving
and
running
like
hell
oh
man
does
that
smell
so
what
do
we
do
now
we
can't
call
buffy
i
wanna
call
buffy
you
can't
she's
got
life
stuff
that
has
to
come
first
so
so
we'll
just
figure
this
out
ourselves
we're
experienced
yes
'cause
it
seems
like
we're
always
dealing
with
creatures
from
outer
space
except
that
we
don't
ever
do
that
this
is
definitely
new
territory
perhaps
we
should
explore
a
bit
more
head
into
the
woods
a
bit
who
votes
research
research
yeah
i
think
that's
a
good
call
there
could
have
been
some
other
cases
like
this
i'm
gonna
stay
here
examine
the
body
some
more
look
around
a
little
bit
yeah
don't
do
anything
hunterly
no
no
i'm
just
not
great
at
research
which
i'm
sure
you
guys
figured
out
i
like
me
a
good
crime
scene
um
give
us
a
call
if
you
need
help
believe
me
something
jumps
out
at
me
in
the
dark
you'll
hear
me
even
without
the
phone
call
me
if
you
learn
anything

from
me
you're
nothing
you're
you're
a
shadow
mom
joyce
i
don't
know
what
you
are
or
how
you
got
here
mom

dawn
dawn

just
tired
we
all
are
come
on
go
to
sleep
i'll
check

on
you
in
a
little
bit
she
hates
me
no
she
called
me
a
thing
she
loves
you
okay
she's
not
herself
i
told
you
what
the
doctor
said
about
the
tumor
no
not
just
mom
people
they
keep
saying
weird
stuff
about
me
are
you
talking
about
the
man
in
the
hospital
he
called
me
a
thing
too
and
there
was
another
one
weird
guy
outside
the
magic
shop
he
said
i
didn't
belong
he
said
i
wasn't
real
why
does
everybody
keep
doing
that
what's
wrong
with
me
nothing
it's
not
you
i
think
there's
something
that
happens
in
people's
brains
when
there's
something
wrong
it's
it's
like
a
shortcircuit
and
it
makes
them
feel
like
nothing's
real
except
for
them
that's
all
it
is
look
it
is
not
you
okay
and
if
anyone
says
anything
like
that
to
you
again
don't
listen
even
if
it's
mom
i
hate
it
i
know
just
don't
listen
look
at
how
teeny
mercury
is
compared
to
like
saturn
whereas
in
contrast
the
cars
of
the
same
name
giles
xander
please
we
have
work
to
do
here
i
still
don't
get
why
we
had
to
come
here
to
get
info
about
a
killer
snot
monster
because
it's
a
killer
snot
monster
from
outer
space
i
did
not
say
that
demons
enter
our
world
in
all
sorts
of
ways
this
one
came
from
above
and
the
university
library's
astronomy
section
is
the
home
of
aboveness
got
it
hey
take
in
the
study
material
too
we've
been
scouring
all
the
international
periodicals
for
any
other
meteorite
landings
in
the
last
week
big
zippo
well
then
it
would
appear
that
the
world
is
not
being
invaded
i'm
pretty
pleased
about
that
uh
guys
i've
got
some
stuff
the
most
recent
meteoric
anomaly
was
the
tunguska
blast
in
russia
in
1917
some
witnesses
claimed
the
meteor
was
hollow
hmm
maybe
with
a
chewy
demon
center
like
ours
how
far
back
does
this
list
of
anomalies
go
pretty
far
back
to
the
queller
impact
in
the
twelfth
century
the
what
queller
ii
don't
know
why
they
call
it
that
it
didn't
hit
a
place
called
queller
or
anything
it
landed
just
outside
of
reykjavik
in
iceland
wait
i
just
saw
queller
quell
here
here
primitive
people
used
to
believe
that
the
moon
was
a
cause
of
insanity
sometimes
they
would
pray
to
the
moon
to
send
a
special
meteor
to
fix
the
problem
the
moon
had
caused
these
meteors
were
expected
to
quell
the
madmen
the
man
in
the
woods
he
was
a
mental
patient
and
he
got
pretty
well
quelled
okay
i'm
looking
in
history
right
now
it
says
in
the
middle
ages
there
were
these
sweeping
plagues
of
madness
people
were
losing
their
marbles
everywhere
but
then
it
would
suddenly
subside
and
these
dates
look
pretty
close
likelike
maybe
it
happened
after
each
one
of
the
meteor
events
so
something
emerged
from
the
meteors
and
quelled
the
madmen
meteor
go
boom
crazy
guy
goes
byebye
xander's
little
book
made
it
sound
like
this
queller
thing
had
to
be
summoned
so
who
summoned
it

else

money's

resident
