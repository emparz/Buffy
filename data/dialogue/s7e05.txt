my
advice
to
you
is
do
exactly
what
everyone
else
does
all
the
time
got
it
do
what
everyone
else
does
wear
what
everyone
else
wears
say
what
everyone
else
says
ok
dawn
people
may
say
something
to
you
you
don't
understand
just
don't
be
afraid
to
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
pretend
like
you
know
what
they're
saying
you
know
dawn
i've
been
to
college
before
people
may
say
something
like
my
protein
window
closes
in
an
hour
just
nod
and
smile
mmhmm
turns
out
it
has
something
to
do
with
fitness
have
you
talked
to
her
lately
not
since
that
night
with
the
gnarl
demon
and
that
wasn't
exactly
the
kind
of
how
have
you
been
kind
of
talk
more
of
the
pierce
its
eye
with
something
sharp
kind
of
talking
i'm
thinking
i
should
call
her
i
just
don't
want
you
to
get
your
hopes
up
hopes
oh
no
no
no
no
no
there
are
no
hopes
anya
and
i
are
done
i
love
being
single
i'm
a
strong
successful
male
who
is
giddy
at
the
thought
of
all
the
women
i
will
no
doubt
be
dating
in
the
near
future
strong
successful
males
say
giddy
i
just
worry
about
her
that's
all
anya
yeah
she
seems
so
sad
she
should
try
acting
like
everybody
else
more
apparently
it's
what
all
the
kids
are
doing
nowadays
well
i'm
not
sure
i
get
the
sad
vibe
but
there's
definitely
a
vengeance
vibe
worth
worrying
about
oh
that
no
no
i
don't
worry
about
that
she
was
hurt
and
she
just
turned
back
to
what
she
knew
when
i—
you
know
but
that's
not
her
anymore
i
hope
you're
right
well
she
turned
that
worm
guy
back
before
any
real
damage
happened
right
it'll
just
take
some
time
i
really
think
she's
coming
around
what
have
i
done
aud
sweet
beautiful
aud
i
am
so
hungry
i
could
eat
a
small
child
olaf
are
you
injured
you
smell
of
blood
and
musk
fear
not
it
takes
more
than
a
band
of
minor
trolls
to
bring
down
the
mighty
olaf
trolls
oh
they
are
wretched
creatures
indeed
the
mere
thought
of
them
makes
me
bend
at
the
knee
and
flex
sweetheart
please
sit
down
allow
me
to
tend
to
you
i
am
fine
really
i
could
go
for
some
mead
though
certainly
is
it
my
imagination
or
do
we
have
substantially
more
rabbits
in
this
house
today
oh
they
breed
so
quickly
that
it's—
all
this
talk
of
breeding
it
makes
me
want
to
breed
honey
of
course
but
here—drink
your
mead
first
ah
yes
mead
the
rapid
reproductive
rate
of
our
rabbitshas
given
me
an
idea
i
can
give
the
excess
out
to
the
townspeople
exchanging
them
not
for
goods
or
services
but
for
goodwill
and
the
sense
of
accomplishment
that
stems
from
selflessly
giving
of
yourself
to
others
ha
ha
ha
sweet
aud
your
logic
is
insane
and
happenstance
like
that
of
a
troll
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
bar
matrons
talk
of
you
you've
been
to
the
bar
it
is
not
my
fault
they
don't
take
kindly
to
you
you
speak
your
mind
and
are
annoying
it's
one
of
the
things
i
love
most
about
you
was
rannveig
there
bah
i've
told
you
a
thousand
times
i
have
no
interest
in
this
rannveig
her
hips
are
large
and
load
bearing
like
a
baltic
woman
your
hips
are
narrow
like
a
baltic
woman
from
a
slightly
more
arid
region
you
are
my
perfect
aud
i
could
never
want
for
another
i
am
sorry
i
simply
love
you
so
muchi
feel
as
though
i
could
burst
at
timesi

not
live
without
you

not
sweet

always
be
my
beautiful

the
sky
watching
cherubs
burn
or
the
heavens
bleed
or
some
nonsense
i
used
to
stare
at
her
and
think
she'd
gone
completely
sack
of
hammers
but
she'd
see
the
sky
when
we
were
inside

it'd
make
her

see
stars

that
no

they

what
they
deserved
thanks
for
sidekicking
i
didn't
want
to
trouble
willow
figure
she's
got
enough
to
do
first
day
back
and
all
are
you
kidding
we're
doing
vent
work
at
the
site
anything's
better
than
breathing
freon
for
eight
hours
so
did
she
say
what
this
thing
is
some
sort
of
spider
demony
thingy
she
had
to
go
pretty
quickly
i
think
she
had
to
sign
up
for
classes
or
something
ah
yes
there
is
little
that
can
distract
the
willow
when
she's
on
the
hunt
for
the
mighty
syllabi
i
don't
know
i
guess
she
was
a
little
more
nervous
than
she
was
letting
on
how
big
did
she
say
this
thing
was
she
didn't
but
i
can't
imagine
she'd
send
us
out
if
it
wasn't—
the
heart
is
completely
ripped
out
this
is
our
guy
or
a
copycat
spider
demon
so
what's
this
black
stuff
aw
it's
sticky
willow
said
it
was
a
spider
demon
maybe
it's
its
webbing
this
isn't
springy
highflying
fun
xander
is
that
it
i
can't
tell
there
is
definitely
something
moving
up
there
maybe
we
can
somehow
lure
it
xander
you
ok
buffy
where'd
it
go
i
think
we
need
more
swords
uhhuh
i
say
we
go
home
pick
up
more
swords
and
some
sort
of
spidery
demon
protection
amulet
we
come
back
and—
or—
i'm
more
concerned
with
where
that
thing
came
from
if
there
are
more
of
those
spider
demons
running
around
we
need
to
know
about
it
we
should
hit
the
research
find
out
if—
i
know
where
it
came
from
how
many
ten
twelve
when
were
you
planning
on
telling
us
i'm
telling
you
now
great
thank
you
willow
it's
anya
how
could
you
let
us—
how
could
you
not
have
told
us
xander
how
could
you
not
have
told
me
xander
it's
ok
she
didn't
tell
us
for
a
reason
she
didn't
tell
us
because
she
knows
what
i
have
to
do
i
have
to
kill
anya
i
swear
i'm
in
awe
of
you
oh
stop
oh
i
will
not
i
grant
wishes
it's
all
inside
the
girl
i
just
bring
it
out
yes
i'm
sure
this
is
what
she
had
in
mind
well
i
don't
know
about
her
mind
but
it
was
in
her
heart
besides
russia
was
ready
to
explode
all
we
did
is
just
give
it
a
little
push
what
should
we
do
with
the
rest
of
our
evening
i
hear
they're
going
to
raze
the
winter
mansion
well
i
thought
we'd
head
on
down
to
madame
dubasov's
no
better
spot
for
vengeance
than
a
brothel
oh
it's
always
work
work
work
with
you
well
of
course
what
else
is
there
what
else
is
there
why
the
whole
world
for
one
darling
take
a
look
around
there's
a
lot
to
see
there's
a
revolution
going
on
outside
that
you
are
somewhat
responsible
for
aren't
you
the
teeniest
bit
interested
well
what
is
there
to
be
interested
in
the
worker
will
overthrow
absolutism
and
lead
the
proletariat
to
a
victorious
communist
revolution
resulting
in
socioeconomic
paradise
on
earth
it's
common
sense
really
i
have
better
things
to
worry
about
but
anyanka
there's
a
whole
world
out
there
yes
filled
with
wronged
women
who
need
my
help
oh
but
you're
talking
work
i'm
talking
about
life
vengeance
is
what
i
do
halfrek
i
don't
need
anything
else
vengeance
is
what
i
am
she's
not
the
anya
that
you
knew
xander
she's
a
demon
that
doesn't
mean
you
have
to
kill
her
don't
act
like
this
is
easy
for
me
you
know
it's
not
there
are
other
options
i've
considered
them
when
just
now
took
you
all
of
ten
seconds
to
decide
to
kill
one
of
your
best
friends
the
thought
that
it
might
come
to
this
has
occurred
to
me
before
it's
occurred
to
you
too
but
we
can
change
what
she
did
fix
it
these
are
mystical
deaths
right
there
has
to
be
something
i
don't
have
anywhere
near
that
kind
of
power
i
didn't
have
that
kind
of
power
when—
and
ii
don't
think
i
trust
the
power
i
do
have
it's
ok
xander
i
know
this
is
hard
for
you
to
hear
but
it's
what
i
have
to
do
hard
for
me
to
hear
buffy
you
wanna
kill
anya
i
don't
want
to
then
don't
this
isn't
new
ground
for
us
when
our
friends
go
all
crazy
and
start
killing
people
we
help
them
sitting
right
here
i'm
sorry
but
it's
true
it's
different
because
you
don't
care
about
her
the
same
way
i
do
buffy
i
still
love
her
i
know
and
that's
why
you
can't
see
this
for
what
it
really
is
willow
was
different
she's
a
human
anya's
a
demon
and
you're
the
slayer
i
see
now
how
it's
all
very
simple
it
is
never
simple
no
of
course
not
you
know
if
there's
a
massmurdering
demon
that
you're
oh
say
boning
then
it's
all
gray
area
spike
was
harmless
he
was
helping
he
had
no
choice
and
anya
did
she
chose
to
become
a
demon
twice
you
have
no
idea
what
she's
going
through
i
don't
care
what
she's
going
through
no
of
course
not
you
think
we
haven't
seen
all
this
before
the
part
where
you
just
cut
us
all
out
just
step
away
from
everything
human
and
act
like
you're
the
law
if
you
knew
what
i
felt—
i
killed
angel
do
you
even
remember
that
i
would
have
given
up
everything
i
had
to
be
with—
i
loved
him
more
than
i
will
ever
love
anything
in
this
life
and
i
put
a
sword
through
his
heart
because
i
had
to
and
that
all
worked
out
ok
do
you
remember
cheering
me
on
both
of
you
do
you
remember
giving
me
willow's
message
kick
his
ass
i
never
said
that—
this
is
different—
it
is
always
different
it's
always
complicated
and
at
some
point
someone
has
to
draw
the
line
and
that
is
always
going
to
be
me
you
get
down
on
me
for
cutting
myself
off
but
in
the
end
the
slayer
is
always
cut
off
there's
no
mystical
guidebook
no
allknowing
council
human
rules
don't
apply
there's
only
me
i
am
the
law
there
has
to
be
another
way
then
please
find
it
i
can't
i'm
sorry

come
to
this
buffy
get
out
of
here
get
out
of
my
way
xander
no
get
out
of
her
way

be
a
pattern
with
you
buffy

there
any
friends
of
your
left
you
haven't
tried
to
kill
c'mon
buffy

you
have
a
clever
retort
for
me
anya
i'm
sorry
you're
apologizing
to
me
what
fight
are
you
watching
or
is
this
like
one
of
your
little
popculture
references
i

get
'cause
i'm
a
vengeance—
i
just
want
happy
ending
honey
honey
what
i'm
awake
i'm
ok
honey

that
weird
that
thing
earlier
with
the
singing
and
the
coconuts
what
no
it's
fine
oh
no
mustard
on
my
shirt
mustard
i'll
never
get
it
out
my
favorite
red
shirt
dry
clean

how
could
you
serve—
mustard
are
you
still
hungry
because
i'd
be—
mr
xander
harris
that's
what
he
is
to
the
world
outside
that's
the
name
he
carries
with
pride
i'm
just
lately
anya
not
very
much
to
the
world
i
know
all
these
years
with
nothing
to
show
i've
boned
a
troll
i've
wreaked
some
wrath
but
on
the
whole
i've
had
no
path
i
like
to
bowl
i'm
good
with
math
but
who
am
i
now
i
reply
that
i'm
the
missus
i
will
be
his
missus
mrs
anya
christina
emanuella
jenkins
harris
what's
the
point
of
loving
i
mean
except
for
the
sweaty
part
what's
the
point
of
losing
your
heart
maybe
if
you're
lucky
being
a
pair
makes
you
twice
as
tall
maybe
you're
not
losing
at
all
no
need
to
cover
up
my
heart
so
maybe
love
is
pretty
smart
and
so
am
i
i
found
my
guy
and
i'll
be
missus
i
will
be
his
missus
mrs
anya
lameassmadeupmaidenname
harris
we'll
never
part
not
if
we
can
and
if
we
start
then
here's
my
plan
i'll
show
him
what
bliss
is
welcome
him
with
kisses
'cause
this
is
a
missus
who
misses
her
man
he's
my
xander
and
he's
awfully
swell
it
makes
financial
sense
as
well
although
he
can
be—i'll
never
tell—
just
stand
aside
here
comes
the
bride
i'll
be
missus
i
will
be
his
missus
i
will
be—
anya
forgotten
how
much
swords
through
the
chest
hurt
aaahh
you
know
better
than
that
buffy
it
takes
a
lot
more
to
kill
a
vengeance
demon
oh
i'm
just
getting
started
stop
trying
to
save
me
xander
oh
please
don't
mind
me
continue
with
whatever
it
was
you
were
doing
oh
breathtaking
it's
like
somebody
slaughtered
an
abercrombie
and
fitch
catalog
easy
now
i'd
be
gone
before
you
could
swing
isn't
that
just
like
a
slayer
solving
all
her
problems
by
sticking
things
with
sharp
objects
i
talked
to
your
friend
miss
rosenberg
she's
a
firebrand
i
have
high
hopes
for
her
stay
away
from
willow
oh
he's
gallant
isn't
he
i
understand
what
you
saw
in
him
look
miss
rosenberg
seems
to
think
anyanka
would
be
better
suited
outside
the
vengeance
fold
i
think
we
already
know
what
lady
hacksaway
wants
and
the
young
man
he
sees
with
the
eyeballs
of
love
but
i'm
not
sure
if
anyone's
bothered
to
find
out
what
anyanka
herself
really
wants
her
name
is
anya
actually
funny
historical
sidebar
her
original
name
was—
i
wanna
take
it
back
i'm
sorry
what
was
that
i
wanna
take
it
back
i
wanna
undo
what
i
did
hmm
you
want
to
take
it
back
must
be
twelve
bodies
in
there
such
a
thing—not
easily
done
but
not
impossible
you're
a
big
girl
anyanka
you
understand
how
this
works
the
proverbial
scales
must
balance
in
order
to
restore
the
lives
of
the
victims
the
fates
require
a
sacrifice
the
life
and
soul
of
a
vengeance
demon
do
it
wait
stay
out
of
this
xander
ok
all
right
that
seems
smart
he
just
said
you
have
to
die
perhaps
there's
some
sort
of
alternate
price
xander
you
can't
help
me
i'm
not
even
sure
there's
a
me
to
help
i
understand
the
price
do
it
you're
sure
this
is
your
wish
this
is
my
wish
undo
what
i
did
very
well
no
anya
hallie
who
did
you
think
you
were
dealing
with
did
you
think
it
would
be
that
easy
to
get
away
why
why
because
you
wished
it
but
she
was
yours
like
you
were
mine
haven't
i
taught
you
anything
anya
never
go
for
the
kill
when
you
can
go
for
the
pain
hold
him
back
slayer
wouldn't
want
anyone
to
get
hurt
i've
got
plenty
of
girls
there
will
always
be
vengeance
demons
but
now
you
anya
you're
out
congratulations
you're
wish
is
granted
you
should've
killed
me
oh
i
wouldn't
worry
about
that
from
beneath
you
it
devours
be
patient
all
good
things
in
time
go
i'll
check
on
the
boys
anya
wait
xander
please
just
go
away
whatever's
between
us—it
doesn't
matter
you
shouldn't
be
alone
in
this
yes
i
should
my
whole
life
i've
just
clung
to
whatever
came
along
well
speaking
as
a
clingee—
i
kinda
didn't
mind
thanks
for
everything
xander—
what
if
i'm
really
nobody
don't
be
a
dope
i'm
a
dope
sometimes
that's
a
start
