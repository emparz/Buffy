so
the
basement
was
filled
with
bodies
apparently
and
spike
could've
sired
countless
others
and
buried
them
around
town
and
we're
waiting
for
him
to
do
what
exactly
do
something
crazy
it's
not
that
simple
shouldn't
we
stab
him
through
the
chest
isn't
that
what
we
do
when
these
things
happen
look
buffy
knows
what
she's
doing
well
xander
you
know
what
we're
all
talking
about
i
mean
you've
always
been
part
of
the
spike
is
evil
faction
i've
got
a
house
to
put
back
together
fine
you
guys
keep
your
heads
buried
in
the
sand
but
i
think
we
should
prepare
ourselves
for
the
possibility
that
william
the
bloody
is
back
all
right
looking
good
how
do
you
feel
good
excellent
we've
got
work
to
do
i
have
to
do
work
right
now
can't
i
just
walk
around
for
a
while
in
my
coat
don't
go
soft
on
me
now
we're
right
in
the
trench
and
the
exhaust
port's
in
sight
i
thought
that
was
it
i
did
what
you
told
me
it's
not
my
fault
it
didn't
work
why
do
i
have
to
do
all
the
wet
works
hey
you
know
the
rules
i
can't
take
corporeal
form
here
feel
mmhmm
cool
pretty
bitchin'
right
i'm
like
obi
wan
or
patrick
swayze
believe
me
i
would
do
this
stuff
if
i
could
i
can't
i
need
you
you're
my
iron
fist
i
just
don't
think
i
can
kill
anybody
else
oh
will
you
stop
whining
about
that
i
didn't
want
to
kill
you
warren
made
me
hey
i'm
glad
he
did
this
is
the
best
thing
that's
ever
happened
to
me
it
didn't
hurt
too
much
ii'm
not
very
good
at
stabbing
you
know
it
wasn't
that
bad
it
was
like
a
sharp
pain
then
a
burning
then
a
general
queasiness
it's
kinda
like
when
i
used
to
get
ulcers
in
high
school
only
at
the
end
i
became
one
with
light
and
hope
i
can't
do
it
i
can't
do
it
anymore
hey
this
isn't
your
fault
ok
it's
my
fault
the
ritual
didn't
work
i
screwed
up
i'm
little—ii
don't
have
as
much
blood
as
other
people
and
i
probably
should've
told
someone
i
was
anemic
don't
worry
we're
gonna
fix
it
you
gotta
trust
us
we
know
what
we're
doing
i
can't
kill
anybody
else
ok
calm
down
we
can
work
around
that
we're
gonna
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
we
just
can't
take
any
chances
don't
make
it
tighter—the
knots'll
give
i
get
free
someone's
gonna
die
now
guys
look
we
can
settle
this
one
of
two
ways
you
can
repaint
the
walls
or
i
can
suspend
you
and
report
this
little
incident
on
your
permanent
record
fine
do
that
ok
i
was
bluffing
i
hadn't
really
thought
that
one
through
listen
this
whole
permanent
record
thing
is
such
a
myth
anyway
colleges
never
ask
for
anything
past
your
sat
scores
and
it's
not
like
employers
are
gonna
be
calling
up
to
check
to
see
how
many
days
you
missed
back
in
high
school
so
listen
ii
could
suspend
you
but
that
would
mean
calling
your
parents
alerting
your
teachers
filling
out
paperwork
and
quite
possibly
having
to
talk
to
the
school
board
all
of
which
sounds
positively
exhausting
to
me
no
no
i
think
it
would
be
much
easier
if
i
just
called
the
police
let
them
deal
with
it
oh
and
in
case
you're
wondering
this
is
the
part
where
i'm
not
bluffing
we'll
repaint
it
good
job
excuse
me
miss
summers
i'm
with
students
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
that
buffy
won't
be
coming
in
today
she's
really
sick
oh
no
yeah
last
night
she
was
vomiting
and
then
this
morning
she
was
vomiting
some
more
and
then
just
when
we
thought
she
was
done
she
was
vomiting
again
yeah
we
got
that
stomach
flu
going
around
her
exact
words
were
i've
got
stuff
coming
out
of
both
ends
thank
you
that's
very
helpful
sure
no
problem
hey
guys
how's
it
going
pretty
good
um
tell
your
sister
not
to
worry
about
it
we'll
soldier
on
without
her
here
just
um
tell
her
to
concentrate
on
getting
better
yeah
she'll
be
fine
she
just
needs
to
get
some
stuff
out
of
her
system
i
need
to
find
him
as
soon
as
possible
he's
not
answering
any
of
his
numbers
miss
summers
the
watcher's
council
does
not
keep
track
of
our
lapsed
employees
ever
since
mr
giles
pulled
up
his
stake
in
sunnydale
we've
not
made
it
our
business
to
follow
his
every
move
you
don't
have
to
get
all
british
and
dodgy
mr
travers
i
know
you
have
ways
of
finding
him
well
i
suppose
if
you
feel
the
matter's
urgent
we
can
look
into
it
i'd
appreciate
it
thank
you
not
at
all
good
day
the
girl
knows
nothing
and
we
need
to
find
rupert
giles
as
soon
as
possible
can
i
do
something
i
think
you
should
probably
go—
here
he's
been
feasting
on
humans
for
weeks
he's
having
some
pretty
bad
withdrawls
i
think
we
need
to
get
him
some
blood
do
you
want
me
to
kill
anya
no
we
should
probably
try
to
wean
him
off
humans
he'll
have
to
make
do
with
animal
blood
i'll
go
get
some
you
don't
mind
no
i
have
to
get
out
of
the
house
xander's
installing
the
new
windows
and
he
keeps
giving
lectures
on
proper
tool
maintenance
tool
talk—not
my
thing
thank
you
how're
you
doing
in
there
he's
in
pretty
bad
shape
past
the
point
where
he
can
tell
me
anything
i
wasn't
asking
about
him
i'll
be
ok
he
won't
feel
a
thing
just
do
it
fast
cut
her
deep
cut
her
quick
it'll
be
over
before
she
knows
what
hit
her
what
if
she
squeals
uh
better
go
for
her
throat
first
babe
2
pig
in
the
city
was
really
underrated
don't
think
about
babe
right
you're
conan
you're
the
destroyer
it's
you
against
nature
you're
the
hunter
you're
primal
you
live
off
the
land
you're
andrew
everyone
knows
you
you
play
by
your
own
rules
it's
kill
or
be
killed
that'll
do
pig
no—you
gotta—you
gotta
corner
it
stay
between
it
and
the
hall
or
it—
that's
the
worst
attempted
pig
slaughtering
i've
ever
seen
i'm
not
very
good
at
stabbing
isn't
there
some
other
way
we
could
get
blood
number
87
i'd
like
12
pork
chops
2
pounds
of
sausage
8
quarts
of
pigs
blood
3
steaks
um
halibut
and
uh
some
toothpaste—

a
butcher's
shop

eternal
pain
dimension

your
revenge

my
best
friend
we're
even

keep
my
skin
ok
i'm
not
bad
i'm
not
bad
anymore

why
do
you
need
lots
and
lots
of
blood
i
am
bad
i'm
bad
i'm
evil
but
i'm
protected
by
powerful
forces
forces
you
can't
even
begin
to
imagine
little
girl
if
you
harm
me
you
shall
know
the
wrath
of
he

is
darkness
and
terror

suffering
stand

defeat
is
at
hand—
shut
your
mouth

am
a
shewitch

very
powerful
shewitch
or
witch

is
more
accurate

be
trifled
with—
but

i'm
talking

interrupt
me
insignificant
man
i
am
willow

you
dare
defy
me
i
will
call
down
my
fury
exact
fresh
vengeance
and
make
your
worst
fears
come
true
ok
look
who
i
found
oh

can't
be
good
guess

was
buying
mass
amounts
of
blood
at
the
butcher's
shop
hey
your
hair's
not
even
black

out
of
me
carpenter

see
about
that
careful
with
my
coat
it's
expensive
is
it
new
hey
ow
now
we
can
do
this
the
hard
way
if
you
want
but
believe
me
if
i
tell
you
this
will
go
much
easier
if
you
just
tell
us
what
you
know
ow
you're
barking
up
the
wrong
asparagus
man
i
don't
know
anything
here's
the
thing
i
don't
believe
you
i
haven't
done
anything
wrong
well
then
you
won't
mind
if
we
ask
you
a
few
questions
yeah
ok
why
were
you
buying
blood
at
the
butcher
shop
i
fell
in
love
with
a
beautiful
vampire
girl
down
in
mehico
now
we're
trying
to
make
a
go
of
it
on
the
straight
and
narrow
and
put
our
lives
back
together
here
in
sunnydale
you
think
this
is
a
game
junior
people
are
dying
friends
lives
are
in
danger
hey
anya
now
you
want
to
waste
time
on
deceptions
not
on
my
watch
hey
anya
can
i
talk
to
you
outside
for
a
second
did
you
see
that
i
actually
made
him
cry
you
were
perfect
i
was
worried
i
overdid
it
with
the
whole
easy
way
hard
way
thing
no
you
were
great
and
i
wasn't
sure
if
i
should
slap
him
but
then
he
made
me
want
to
slap
him
so
i
thought
ok
slap
him
he'll
be
singing
in
no
time
so
what
do
we
do
now
now
we
let
him
stew
in
his
own
juices
for
a
bit
then
we
give
him
the
hard
brace
right
what's
the
status
with
your
guy
he's
not
talking
yet
we'll
get
there
how's
your
guy
the
weasel
wants
to
sing
he
just
needs
a
tune
he's
primed
i'll
be
pumping
him
in
no
time
he'll
give
us
information
soon
better
good
i
don't
remember
anything
well
you
were
having
pretty
bad
withdrawal
no
not
that
i
don't
remember
what
i
did
nothing
it's
all
flashes
here
and
there
it's
like
i'm
watching
someone
elsedo
it
kill
people
i've
been
losing
time
for
a
while
now
waking
up
in
strange
places
when
did
your
chip
stop
working
i
wasn't
aware
that
it
had
you
know
not
'til
now
and
the
losing
time
how
long
has
that
been
going
on
oh
things
have
been
wonky
since
i
got
back
ever
since—
you
got
your
soul
figured
that's
what
it
was
like
it'd
been
so
long
since
i
had
one
how
did
you
do
it
how'd
you
get
your
soul
back
saw
a
man
about
a
girl
i
went
to
seek
a
legend
out
traveled
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
made
a
deal
with
a
demon
just
like
that
no
not
just
like
that
there
was
a
price
there
were
trials
torture
pain
and
suffering
of
sorts
of
sorts
well
it's
all
relative
isn't
it
meaning
meaning
i
have
come
to
redefine
the
words
pain
and
suffering
since
i
fell
in
love
with
you
how
can
you
say
that
apparently
i
just
slaughtered
half
of
sunnydale
pet
i'm
not
really
worried
about
being
polite
anymore
so
that's
what
this
is
about
you
feeling
sorry
for
yourself
spike
i'm
feeling
honest
with
myself
you
used
me
yes
you
told
me
that
of
course
i
never
understood
it
though
not
until
now
you
hated
yourself
and
you
took
it
out
on
me
you
figured
that
out
just
now
soul's
not
all
about
moonbeams
and
pennywhistles
luv
it's
about
selfloathing
i
get
it
had
to
travel
'round
the
world
but
i
understand
you
now
i
understand
the
violence
inside
violence
william
the
bloody
now
has
insight
into
violence
not
the
same
as
bad
as
i
was
as
evil
and
as
wretched
as
i
was
i
never
truly
hated
myself
back
then
not
like
i
do
now
how's
your
face
ok
xander
sorry
about
that
she
shouldn't
have
hit
you
thirsty
go
on
that
chick's
psycho
you
don't
know
the
half
of
it
she's
a
vengeance
demon
you
know
she's
bad
news
this
one
time
i
saw
her
having
sex
with
spike
she's
killed
more
men
than
smallpox
does
smallpox
still
kill
people
she's
killed
a
lot
of
men
she
tortures
them
anyone
who
incurs
her
wrath
one
time
she—
no
never
mind
what
it's
not
important
what'd
she
do
well
there
was
this
one
guy—there
was
this
one
guy
he
uh
he
hurt
her
real
bad
so
she
paid
him
back
she
killed
him
but
she
did
it
real
slow
see
first
she
stopped
his
heart
then
she
replaced
it
with
darkness
then
she
made
him
live
his
life
like
that
but
he
still
had
to
go
do
his
job
and
see
his
friends
and
wake
up
in
the
morning
and
go
to
bed
at
night
but
he
had
to
do
it
all
empty
without
anything
to
look
forward
to
ever
sounds
bad
well
then
she
tore
out
his
intestines
and
rubbed
it
in
his
face
and
took
pictures
of
it
oh
god
but
she's
downstairs
now
don't
worry
about
her
what
if—

the
thing

we've
all

little
on

seal
of
danthaz—
he
didn't

i
mean
he
just
pushed
me
aside
and
charged
at
the
wall
are
you

really
how
is
what's
his
name
he's

a
good
chunk
taken
out
of

he'll
be
all

just
to
keep
him
from
scratching
at
his
bandages
what
the
hell
happened
up

spike
and
i
were
having
a
conversation

he
was
fine

be
and
then
i
went
to
check
on
you

when
i
got
back
it
was
like
he
was
a
completely
different
person
different
like
william
the
bloody
type
different
he
was
talking
to
someone
i
heard
through
the
door
he
was
having
this
conversation
and
then
he
started
singing
maybe
it's
another
musical
a
much
crappier
musical
he—he
mentioned
something
about
a
song
in
the
cellar
uh
aand
he
changed
there
too—i
mean
instantly
became
another
person
trigger
the
horse
no
in
his
head
it's
a
trigger
it's
a
brainwashing
term
it's
how
the
military
makes
sleeper
agents
theythey
brainwash
operatives
and
condition
them
with
a
specific
trigger
like
a
song
that
makes
'em
drastically
change
at
a
moment's
notice
is
this
left
over
from
your
days
in
the
army
no
this
is
left
over
from
every
army
movie
i've
ever
seen
but
it
makes
sense
we've
had
ghosts
or
something
haunting
us
right
well
what
if
spike's
ghosts
have
figured
out
a
way
to—not
only
haunt
him—what
if
they
figured
out
how
to—how
to
control
him
spike
said
he's
been
seeing
things
since
i
found
him
in
the
basement
so
he
gets
his
soul
back
he
starts
seeing
spooky
things
and
he
goes
extraextracrazy
this
trigger
how
do
we
holster—safety
or—i
don't
know
guns
how
do
we
make
it
stop
well
usually
the
operative
completes
his
task
and
either
blows
his
head
off
or
steals
a
submarine
all
right
i
need
information
if
spike's
a
bomb
then
i
need
to
know
how
to
diffuse
him
you
two
i
wanna
know
what
did
this
to
him
spirits
ghosts
demons—check
the
lot
of
them
look
for
anything
that
could
haunt
oror
possibly
control
like
this
i
need
to
know
exactly
what
we're
dealing
with
did
i
hurt
anybody
you
took
a
good
bite
out
of
andrew
who
tucker's
brother
oh
he'll
be
ok
i
don't
remember
it's
ok
buffy
i
don't
know
why
we
think
we
do
something's
playing
you
some
ghost
or
demon
has
figured
out
how
to
control
you
got
the
gang
researching
it
right
now
xander
has
this
theory
that
you're
being
triggered
kill
me
what
buffy
you
have
to
kill
me
you
don't
understand
when
i
left
the
room
earlier
i
heard
you
talking
to
someone—
do
you
have
any
idea
what
i'm
capable
of
i
was
in
the
cellar
with
you
i
saw
what
you
did
i'm
not
talking
about
the
cellar
the
people
in
the
cellar
got
off
easy
i'm
talking
about
me
buffy
you
have
never
met
the
real
me
believe
me
i'm
well
aware
of
what
you're
capable
of
no
you
got
off
easy
too
do
you
know
how
much
blood
you
can
drink
from
a
girl
before
she'll
die
i
do
you
see
the
trick
is
to
drink
just
enough
to
know
how
to
damage
them
just
enough
so
that
they'll
still
cry
when
you—
'cause
it's
not
worth
it
if
they
don't
cry
it's
not
your
fault
you're
not
the
one
doing
this
i
already
did
it
it's
already
done
you
wanna
know
what
i've
done
to
girls
dawn's
age
this
is
me
buffy
you've
got
to
kill
me
before
i
get
out
we
can
keep
you
locked
up
keep
you
here
and
we'll
figure
out—
have
you
ever
really
asked
yourself
why
you
can't
do
it
off
me
after
everything
i've
done
to
you
to
people
around
you
it's
not
love
we
both
know
that
you
fought
by
my
side
you've
saved
lives
you've
helped—
don't
do
that
don't
rationalize
this
into
some
noble
act
we
both
know
the
truth
of
it
you
like
men
who
hurt
you
no
you
need
the
pain
we
cause
you
you
need
the
hate
you
need
it
to
do
your
job
to
be
the
slayer
no
i
don't
hate
like
that
not
you
or
myself
not
anymore
you
think
you
have
insight
now
because
your
soul's
drenched
in
blood
you
don't
know
me
you
don't
even
know
you
was
that
you
who
killed
those
people
in
the
cellar
was
that
you
who
waited
for
those
girls
there's
no
one
else
that's
not
true
listen
to
me
you're
not
alive
because
of
hate
or
pain
you're
alive
because
i
saw
you
change
because
i
saw
your
penance
window
dressing
be
easier
wouldn't
it
it
if
were
an
act
but
it's
not
you
faced
the
monster
inside
of
you
and
you
fought
back
you
risked
everything
to
be
a
better
man
buffy
and
you
can
be
you
are
you
may
not
see
it
but
i
do
i
do
i
believe
in
you
spike
buffy
dawn
she's
ok
is
this
it
i
thought
there
was
more
of
them
spike
they
were
so
fast
and
organized
they
were
after
spike
all
along
and
we
were
just
in
the
way
i
know
these
guys
i
fought
them
before
we
aren't
being
haunted
this
isn't
some
demon
it's
all
the
same
thing
spike's
ghosts
the
people
you
guys
saw
from
beneath
us
it's
all
the
same
thing
i
know
what
we're
up
against
the
first
they
took
our
files
wiped
out
our
records
we've
lost
contact
with
operations
in
munich
switzerland
and
rome
we've
got
casualty
confirmations
coming
in
from
as
far
away
as
melbourne
sir
we
are
crippled
it's
all
right
lydia
we
are
still
masters
of
our
fate
still
captains
of
our
souls
yes
sir
ladies
and
gentlemen
our
fears
have
been
confirmed
the
first
evil
has
declared
allout
war
on
this
institution
their
first
volleys
proved
most
effective
i
for
one
think
it's
time
we
struck
back
give
me
confirmations
on
all
remaining
operatives
visuals
and
tacticals
highest
alert
get
them
here
as
soon
as
possible
begin
preparations
for
mobilization
once
we're
accounted
for
i
want
to
be
ready
to
move
sir
we'll
be
paying
a
visit
to
the
hell
mouth
my
friends
these
are
the
times
that
define
us
proverbs
246
o
by
wise
council
you
shall
make
your
war
you'll
have
to
excuse
the
spectacle
but
i've
always
been
a
bit
of
a
sucker
for
the
old
classics
oh
oh
don't
look
at
me
that
way
i
wanted
to
do
this
more
subtlelike
my
harbingers
have
a
tendency
to
call
attention
to
themselves
oh
you're
the
one
who
couldn't
hold
his
end
of
the
bargain
you're
the
one
who
couldn't
take
care
of
what'shisname
you're
the
one
who
had
to
make
breakthroughs
and
learn
something
about
himself
oh
so
now
fittingly
you're
the
one
who
gets
to
do
the
honors
i
have
to
admit
i'm
glad
it
worked
out
this
way
i
was
going
to
bleed
andrew
but
you
look
a
lot
better
with
your
shirt
off
to
be
honest
i'm
getting
a
little
tired
of
subtle
i
think
it's
about
time
we
brought
some
authority
to
our
presence
now
spike
wanna
see
what
a
real
vampire
looks
like
