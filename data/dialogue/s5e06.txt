tell
me
a
story
okay
once
upon
a
time
there
was
um
a
kitty
she
was
very
little
and
she
was
all
alone
and
nobody
wanted
her
this
is
a
very
upsetting
story
oh
oh
but
it
gets
better
'cause
one
day
the
kitty
was
running
around
in
the
street
and
a
man
came
and
swooped
her
up
and
took
her
to
the
pound
and
at
the
pound
there
were
lots
of
other
kitties
and
there
were
puppies
and
some
ferrets
were
there
dolphins
yes
many
dolphins
at
the
pound
or
was
there
a
camel
there
was
the
front
of
a
camel
a
half
camel
did
the
kitty
get
chosen
by
some
nice
people
well
now
you
ruined
the
ending
mmm
i'm
sleepy
do
you
mind
if
i
keep
the
light
on
i
was
gonna
look
up
some
spells
it's
fine
i
don't
need
to
be
snuggled
vixen
you've
been
spell
gal
night
and
day
lately
well
i
just
wanna
keep
up
with
you
and
i'm
well
i
just
like
to
be
useful
you
know
to
the
gang
i
just
never
feel
useful
you
are
you're
essential
do
you
think
buffy
found
out
anything
tonight
at
the
factory
i
don't
know
if
there
was
something
i
figured
she'd
call
us
uh
i
don't
know
what
to
say
tell
me
about
it
she
has
no
idea
no
she
thinks
she's
my
kid
sister
are
you
going
to
tell
her
how
can
i
she'd
freak
and
that's
the
last
thing
we
need
we
have
to
keep
her
safe
this
woman
this
uh
whatever
she
was
she
knows
you
now
should
we
be
thinking
about
sending
dawn
away
away
where
i
don't
know
uh
your
father's
yeah
he's
um
in
spain
with
his
secretary
living
the
cliche
i
called
him
when
mom
got
sick
he
hasn't
even
i'm
sorry
when
he
bailed
on
us
i
remember
dawn
cried
for
a
week
except
she
didn't
she
wasn't
there
but
i
can
still
feel
what
it
was
like
they
sent
her
to
me
giles
i
think
i
have
to
take
care
of
her
i
want
to
do
we
tell
the
others
no
no
one
theythey'd
act
weird
around
her
and
it's
it's
safer
for
everyone
if
they
don't
know
yes
we
have
to
find
out
who
this
woman
is
and
what
she
needs
dawn
for
i
mean
if
she
comes
after
you
buffy
she'll
come
she'll
come
for
us
okay
now
i'm
upset
ow
thumb
necessary
opposable
thumb
sorry
crybaby
you
know
what
you
guys
just
leave
it
here
got
it
i
don't
need
help
just
be
careful
but
we
just
helped
her
move
the
stuff
in
a
few
days
ago
and
it
was
fun
people
help
each
other
out
anya
it's
one
of
our
strange
customs
giles
i
noticed
you're
doing
the
smallest
amount
of
helping
that
can
actually
be
called
helping
well
i
saw
myself
in
more
of
a
patriarchal
sort
of
role
you
know
lots
of
pointing
and
scowling
you
two
stop
that
he
started
it
he
called
me
a
bad
name
i
think
it
was
bad
it
might've
been
latin
stop
it
or
you're
going
to
break
something
or
i'm
going
to
break
something
still
can't
believe
you're
giving
up
this
cherry
corner
suite
just
a
few
days
after
we
moved
you
in
it's
no
big
you
know
with
mom
not
being
well
i'm
hardly
ever
here
just
figured
i'd
save
a
little
cash
for
this
semester
that's
all
i
think
that's
smart
still
it's
hard
to
give
up
you've
got
the
two
entrances
lot
of
opportunity
for
bawdy
french
farce
and
everybody
loves
bawdy
buffy
where's
dawn
i
think
she
just
walked
out
dawn
some
of
your
cds
are
my
cds
i
know
come
help
me
fold
starting
to
feel
that
fight
nothing
like
gettin'
your
ass
kicked
to
make
your
ass
hurt
you'll
totally
take
her
next
time
'cause
you'll
have
backup
baby

messin'
with
all
of
us
yes
uh
we'll
we'll
uh
find
her
weaknesses

then
uh
tara
yeah
you
learn
her
source
and
uh
we'll
introduce
her

i
forgot
about
the
party
i
mean
there's
kind
of
a
lot
going
on
and
it's
not
you
know
the
most
thrilling
social
event
of
the
season
yeah
it's
a
big
deal
for
willow
though
i
mean
you
are
gonna
be
there
yeah
barring
monsters
hey
hi
gimme
sugar
i've
come
to
buy
sugar
mmm
we
value
your
patronage
so
any
breakthroughs
on
the
identity
of
miss
congeniality
well
i
have
narrowed
it
down
somewhat
your
definition
of
narrow
is
impressively
wide
well
you
didn't
give
me
much
to
go
on
sheshe
looks
human
so
the
mug
shots
aren't
any
use
and
uh
you
can't
be
more
specific
about
what
she's
like
she
was
kinda
like
cordelia
actually
i'm
pretty
sure
she
dyes
her
hair
right
that
one
of
course
our
work
is
done
there
must
be
something
on
her
the
answer
is
somewhere
here
it's
right
in
front
of
us
and
we're
too
blind
to
see
it
i'm
helping
i'm
reading
i'm
quiet
so
what'd
you
get
her
huh
tara
you
said
you
got
a
present
already
yeah
that
was
a
tangled
web
of
lies
sweetie
i'm
not
really
sure
what
kind
of
thing
she'd
i
mean
i
don't
really
know
her
that
well
i
know
i
mean
she's
nice
yeah
yeah
nice
nice
iit's
just
ii
sort
of
i
don't
necessarily
get
her
but
she's
really
nice
yeah
there's
just
that
thing
that
thing
that
thing
of
not
understanding
xander
half
of
what
she
says
as
for
example
but
she's
super
nice
you
betcha
think
there'll
be
a
lot
of
wiccas
there
heavy
wiccan
crowd
well
that's
sort
of
her
deal
her
and
willow
are
all
wiccie
swingin'
with
the
wiccan
lifestyle
which
is
cool
well
yeah
i
just
hope
we
fit
in
not
awkward
with
willow
it's
like
she's
got
this
whole
new
thing
in
her
life
but
she's
still
willow
so
i
can
always
figure
her
out
but
tara
i
just
know
she
likes
willow

she
already
has
one
of
those
ugh

too
many
things
for
me
to
worry
about
relax
you

do
something
to

off
the
tension

the
big
deal
i'm
just
gonna
go
buffy
no
it's
family
night
and
besides

a
bad
influence
i

that
short
i
am
so
glad
you're
moving
back
into
the
house
this
is
the
source
of
my
gladness
she
makes
me
crazy
that's
kinda
the
word
i
was
searching
for
what
she
shouldn't
be
going
over
there
yeah
a
lot
of
young
people
nowadays
are
experimenting
with
shortness
gotta
nip
that
in
the
bud
she
can't
be
running
out
whenever
she'd
like
it's
more
than
that
what
do
you
mean
you
tell
me
we
all
have
to
be
careful
this
demon
chick
is
exciting
and
new
i
don't
know
what
i'm
up
against
if
we're
in
trouble
here
i
could
contact
graham
maybe
get
the
government
boys
on
it
buffy
no
no
iii
don't
want
them
anywhere
near
this
just
a
suggestion
look
the
fewer
people
that
are
involved
the
safer
i
will
feel
every
time
i
think
i'm
getting
close
to
you

i
gotta
take
off
wait
what
i'll
call
you
later
riley
i
want
you
to
help
i'm
not
riley
yeah
know
you
got
a
lot
on
your
mind
you
decide
you
wanna
let
me
in
on
any
of
it
let
me
know
i'll
come
running
the
door
wasn't
locked
i
was
a
little
early
i
suppose
you
wanted
me
to
see
all
these

toys
you
don't
even
try
to
hide
it
anymore
i'd
hoped
maybe
you'd
gotten
over
the
whole
witchcraft
thing
that
if
we
let
you
go
you'd
get
it
out
of
your
system
then
they
told
me
to
look
for
you
in

that
store
i
didn't
i
i
didn't
knknow
that
you
were
coming
of
course
we
came
we
haven't
heard
from
you
in
months
your
birthday's
getting
closer
and
closer
you
know
what
that
means
i
don't
think
it's

it
it
won't
mean
that
mr
maclay
you're
turning
twenty
it's
the
same
age
your
mother
was
when
she
do
your
friends
even
know
yyes
are
you
lying
to
me
tara
you're
coming
home
with
us
you
know
it's
the
only
way
home
you
can't
control
what's
going
to
happen
you
have
evil
inside
of
you
and
it
will
come
out
and
letting
yourself
work
all
this
magic
is
only
going
to
make
it
worse
where
do
you
think
that
power
comes
from
it
it
doesn't
feel
evil
sir
evil
never
does
i
don't
feel
much
like
eating
right

i'll
give
you
some
time
but
we
need
to
be
gone
by
morning
your
family
loves
you
tara
no
matter
what
how
do
you
think
your
friends
are
going
to
feel
when
they
see
your
true
face
finally
i
thought
you
were
gonna
nap
the
whole
day
away
stop
whining
you
know
i
remember
when
the
leiach
were
a
proud
warrior
race
not
sneaking
around
hospitals
looking
for
weak
sickly
types
to
suck
the
bone
marrow
from
but
let's
talk
about
my
problems
for
thirty
seconds
if
that's
perfectly
all
right
with
you
blonde
short
strong
for
a
human

and
massively
rude
broke
my
shoe
took
my
monk
do
you
have
any
idea
who
i'm
talking
about
a
slayer
oh
god
please
don't
tell
me
i
was
fighting
a
vampire
slayer
how
unbelievably
common
if
i
had
friends
and
they
heard
about
this

and
you
know
she's
going
around
telling
everybody
i
mean
she
probably
just
pay
attention
i
am
great
and
i
am
beautiful
and
when
i
walk
into
a
room
all
eyes
turn
to
me
because
my
name
is
a
holy
name
and
you
will
listen
get
your
friends
find
the
girl
kill
the
girl
okay
baby
you
have
the
cutest
little
suppurating
sores
has
anyone
ever
told
you
that
hey
hey

demon
chick

try
that
that
spell
you
know
the
one
to
find
demons
that

work
yeah
but
we
only
tried
it
once

family's
here
