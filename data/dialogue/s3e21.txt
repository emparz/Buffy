teacher
draws
in
the
head
they
always
go
the
the
e
next
steven
hi
hey
so
i
was
wondering
maybe
if
you
were
free
this
weekend
maybe
we
could
do
some
entertaining
thing
would
that
be
along
the
lines
of
you
telling
me
about
all
the
men
you
destroyed
back
in
your
demon
days
cause
pencil
me
in
well
we
could
do
something
else
you
like
we
could
watch
sports
of
some
kind
uh
i
don't
know
men
like
sports
i'm
sure
of
it
yes
men
like
sports
men
watch
the
action
move
they
eat
of
the
beef
and
enjoy
to
look
at
the
bosoms
a
thousand
years
of
avenging
our
wrongs
and
that's
all
you've
learned
i'm
trying
okay
you
don't
need
to
take
my
head
off
i'm
sorry
look
i
don't
even
know
if
i'm
going
to
make
it
to
the
next
weekend
i'll
tell
you
what
i
survive
the
ascension
and
maybe
you
and
i
can
do
some
sports
related
what
faith
you
sure
one
of
her
pieces
i
recognize
the
brush
work
brutally
stabbed
mr
wirth
visiting
professor
of
geology
there's
nothing
in
here
that
bellows
motive
random
killing
perhaps
fit
of
rage
everybody
does
seem
to
be
going
a
bit
mad
lately
faith
has
something
of
a
head
start
doesn't
read
i
think
it's
homework
the
mayor
wanted
the
good
professor
out
of
the
way
which
leads
to
the
question
how
come
i'm
gonna
destroy
the
entire
city
but
i
take
the
time
to
kill
harmless
lester
first
tying
up
loose
ends
lester
had
something
or
knew
something
then
i
wanna
know
too
the
mayor's
trying
to
hide
i
say
we
go
seek
ah
by
attempting
to
keep
a
valuable
clue
from
us
the
mayor
may
have
inadvertently
led
us
right
to
it
what
page
are
you
on
wes
cause
we
already
got
there
yes
well
you
will
go
tonight
look
over
his
apartment
anything
of
note
report
back
here
i
just
love
it
when
you
take
charge
you
man
you
uh
we
was
that
a
yes
i
have
trouble
keeping
track
i'll
go
be
careful
if
faith
should
show
up
i
don't
think
she'll
show
been
there
killed
that
she's
not
much
for
followup
nonetheless
keep
watch
faith
has
you
at
a
disadvantage
buffy
cause
i'm
not
crazy
or
cause
i
don't
kill
people
both
actually
i
hear
you
i
can't
kill
her
fun
as
it
may
sound
i
can
make
her
cry
uncle
though
and
i
mean
to
don't
let
your
feelings
about
faith
interfere
with
your
work
stopping
faith
is
my
work
take
a
beat
to
love
the
synergy
faith
is
a
footnote
our
priority
is
stopping
the
ascension
easier
said
than
done
boy
xander
if
you
don't
have
something
constructive
to
add
you
guys
want
to
know
about
the
ascension
well
meet
the
only
living
person
who's
ever
been
to
one
about
eight
hundred
years
ago
in
the
kastka
vallies
above
the
urals
there
was
a
sorcerer
there
who
achieved
ascension
became
the
embodiment
of
the
demon
lohash
i
was
there
cursing
a
shepherd
who
had
been
unfaithful
his
wife
had
wished
that
all
his
sheep
would
lie
with
can
we
get
back
to
the
chase
sorry
lohash
was
itit
decimated
the
village
within
hours
maybe
three
people
got
out
i've
seen
some
horrible
things
in
my
time
i've
been
the
cause
of
most
of
them
actually
but
this
ahem
i'm
sorry
but
lohash
was
a
fourwinged
soul
killer
am
i
right
i
was
given
to
understand
that
they're
not
that
fierce
of
all
the
demons
that
we've
faced
you've
never
seen
a
demon
uh
excuse
me
kind
of
professionally
four
years
running
all
the
demons
that
walk
the
earth
are
tainted
are
human
hybrids
like
vampires
the
ascension
means
that
a
human
becomes
pure
demon
they're
different
different
how
well
for
one
thing
they're
bigger
kids
are
here
parents
off
to
the
side
there
we'll
go
up
they'll
play
the
processional
and
they
you'll
give
the
address
it
all
looks
wonderful
as
long
as
nobody
makes
any
trouble
oh
stop
worrying
you
just
make
sure
the
kids
show
up
anybody
who
doesn't
feel
like
coming
to
graduation
well
they'll
just
have
to
live
without
a
diploma
they'll
be
here
sir
call
me
richard
you've
done
a
great
job
here
i
know
things
are
well
different
here
in
sunnydale
we've
both
seen
all
sorts
of
things
what's
important
is
that
we
keep
it
under
control
and
that's
what
you've
done
i
believe
in
order
sunnydale
owes
you
a
debt
it
will
be
repaid
yessir
we'll
mark
that
invoice
paid
in
full
it
doesn't
sound
like
lohash
the
rituals
are
all
different
i
wish
that
was
a
relief
what's
going
on
how
come
evil
girl's
in
the
mix
anya
witnessed
an
ascension
oh
okay
then
what
about
the
spiders
the
mayor
had
a
box
of
spiders
that
he
had
to
eat
the
box
of
i
want
to
say
gravlocks
gavrock
it
doesn't
ring
a
bell
well
there
must
be
something
that
you
can
remember
that
would
be
helpful
so
this
is
the
inner
sanctum
faith
tells
me
this
is
where
you
folks
like
to
hang
out
concoct
your
little
schemes
i
tell
you
it's
just
nice
to
see
that
some
young
people
are
still
interested
in
reading
in
this
modern
era
so
what
are
kids
reading
nowadays
the
beast
will
walk
upon
the
earth
and
darkness
will
follow
the
several
races
of
man
will
be
as
one
in
their
terror
and
destruction
aw
that's
kind
of
sweet
different
races
coming
together
you
never
get
even
a
little
tired
of
hearing
yourself
speak
do
you
that's
one
spunky
little
girl
you've
raised
i'm
gonna
eat
her
whoa
well
now
that
was
a
little
thoughtless
violent
outbursts
like
that
in
front
of
the
children
you
know
mr
giles
they
look
to
you
to
see
how
to
behave
get
out
i
smell
fear
that's
smart
some
of
your
deaths
will
be
quick
if
that's
worth
anything
well
see
you
all
at
graduation
you
don't
want
to
miss
my
commencement
address
it's
going
to
be
one
heck
of
a
speech
anya
wait
where
you
going
anywhere
if
there's
a
lunar
shuttle
going
up
anytime
soon
i'm
on
it
we
need
you
here
you
might
be
able
to
help
or
i
might
be
able
to
live
you
can't
stop
the
ascension
xander
you
were
right
the
first
time
the
only
thing
any
sane
person
can
do
now
is
run
what's
her
saga
she's
freaking
about
what
the
mayor
is
going
to
kill
us
all
during
graduation
oh
are
you
going
to
go
to
fifth
period
i'm
thinking
i
might
skip
it
me
too
buffy
i'm
home
do
you
wanna
go
to
uh
what
are
you
doing
you're
running
away
again
and
you're
taking
my
clothes
mom
i
need
you
to
leave
town
tonight
buffy
i'd
miss
your
graduation
yeah
that's
sort
of
the
idea
there's
no
way
i
wouldn't
dream
mom
graduation
is
a
pointless
ceremony
where
you
sit
around
and
listen
to
a
bunch
of
boring
speeches
until
someone
hands
you
a
piece
of
paper
that
says
you
graduated
which
you
already
know
and
maroon
does
nothing
for
my
complection
so
don't
argue
okay
what
is
some
terrible
demon
going
to
attack
the
school
oh
i
see
oh
you
know
buffy
looking
back
on
everything
that's
happened
maybe
i
should
have
sent
you
to
a
different
school
just
promise
me
that
you'll
be
far
away
from
here
i'm
not
leaving
you
to
face
an
awful
monster
if
i
go
anywhere
you're
going
with
me
you
know
that
i
can't
well
then
i
can't
either
mom
i
know
that
sometimes
you
wish
i
were
different
buffy
no
i
wish
i
could
be
a
lot
of
things
for
you
a
great
student
a
star
athlete
remotely
normal
i'm
not
but
there
is
something
i
do
that
i
can
do
better
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
i'm
gonna
fight
this
thing
but
i
can't
do
it
and
worry
about
you
buffy
you
just
can't

you
stay
you'll
get
me
killed
you'll
have
to
trust
me
on
this
can
you
do
that
oh
this
is
so
frustrating
nothing
useful
no
it's
great
if
we
want
to
make
ferns
invisible
or
communicate
with
shrimp
i've
got
the
goods
right
here
our
lives
are
different
than
other
peoples'
oh
who
am
i
kidding
i'm
not
going
to
find
a
spell
to
stop
the
ascension
i'm
no
witch
i
can't
even
change
poor
amy
back
to
a
person
but
you
got
the
swinging
habitrail
going
i
think
amy
is
in
a
good
place
emotionally
oz
what
could
you
just
pretend
to
care
about
what's
happening
please
you
think
i
don't
care
i
think
we
could
be
dead
in
two
days
time
and
you're
being
ironic
detachment
guy
would
it
help
if
i
panic
yes
it
would
be
swell
panic
is
a
thing
people
can
share
in
times
of
crisis
and
everything's
really
scary
now
you
know
and
i
don't
know
what's
gonna
happen
and
there's
all
sorts
of
things
that
you're
supposed
to
get
to
do
after
high
school
and
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
doing
them
and
now
we're
probably
just
gonna
die
and
i
would
like
to
feel
that
maybe
you
would

what
are
you
doing
panicking
ow
stealthy
not
my
best
entrance
i
think
they
were
mopping
in
the
halls
what
are
you
doing
here
i
checked
in
with
giles
he
asked
me
to
back
you
up
he's
afraid
i'll
run
into
faith
and
you're
not
it's
gonna
happen
sooner
or
later
what's
that
a
report
excavation
of
some
old
lava
bed
guy
was
a
volcanoologist
or
something
anything
in
there
that
connects
him
to
the
mayor
i
looked
through
it
but
the
only
thing
i
understood
were
the
commas
gonna
bring
it
to
giles
see
if
he
can
do
better
let
me
give
you
a
hand
you
know
what
thank
you
but
i
can
take
it
from
here

the
ozone
for
all
i
know

this
harder
to
make
this
easier
on
yourself
could
we
stop
with
the
brainteasers
i
just
wish
it
was
over
done
it's
not
that
simple
i
mean
once
the
mayor

know
world
in
peril
and
we
have
to
work
together
this
is
my
last
office
romance
i'll
tell
you
that
i'll
get
out
of
your
face
isn't
it
even
a
little
hard
for
you
how
can
you
ask
me
that
just
because
i'm
not
acting
like
a
brat
doesn't
mean
i
don't
feel
it's
nice
to
know
what
you
thing
of
me
what
do
you
expect
me
to
say
when
you
just
attack
i
just
can't
do
this
anymore
i
can't
have
you
in
my
life
when
i'm
trying
to
move
on
angel
missed
the
heart
meant
to
there
okay
ready
yeah
on
three
one
i
knew
you
were
going
to
do
that
not
too
much
blood
here
i
heal
pretty
fast
i
should
be
alright
i'm
just
glad
faith's
such
a
suck
shot
you
sure
it
was
her
well
i've
narrowed
down
my
list
of
one
suspect
fascinating
what
it
seems
our
mr
wirth
headed
an
expedition
in
hawaii
digging
in
old
lava
beds
near
a
dormant
volcano
i'm
not
fascinated
yet
he
found
something
underneath
a
carcass
buried
by
an
eruption
a
carcass
a
very
large
one
mr
wirth
posits
that
it
might
be
some
heretofore
undiscovered
dinosaur
a
demon
yes
that
would
be
something
that
the
mayor
would
want
to
keep
a
secret
if
it's
the
same
kind
of
demon
he's
turning
into
and
it's
dead
it
means
that
well
he's
only
impervious
to
harm
until
the
ascension
in
his
demon
form
he
can
be
killed
great
so
all
we
need
is
a
million
tons
of
burning
lava
we're
saved
well
it's
a
start
anyway
okay
you've
been
a
real
klutz
today
you
need

damn
we'll
have
to
run
some
tests
you're
burning
up
it's
poison
i
can
feel
it
call
the
others
get
them
here
we
need
to
move
him
to
the
safety
of
his
own
bed
before
the
sun
comes
up
will
you
be
able
to
find
out
what
this
is
the
council
has
all
the
known
toxins
on
file
mystical
or
otherwise
i'll
contact
them
immediately
thanks
you're
going
to
be
okay
i
feel
different
you
know
ii
guess
that
makes
sense
do
you
feel
different
oh
no
you've
already
probably
no
big
change
for
you
it
was
nice
was
it
nice
should
this
be
a
quiet
moment
i
know
exactly
what
you
mean
which
part
everything
from
'it's
different'
hello
we've
gotta
go
he's
dropped
boss
applause
applause
right
in
the
back
he
pitches
over
and
buffy's
freaking
looking
around
all
panicked
it's
a
good
time
well
that
should
keep
her
occupied
for
a
spell
what
next
the
ritual
of
gavrock
i
have
to
ingest
several
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
box
ingest
eat
you're
wicked
gross
well
you
don't
have
to
watch
just
you
know
go
home
take
it
easy
it's
a
big
day
tomorrow
you
gotta
give
me
something
to
do
there's
no
way
i'm
sleeping
don't
you
need
anyone
dead
or
maimed
i
can
settle
for
maimed
you
little
firecracker
my
mom
used
to
call
me
that
when
i
was
little
i
was
always
running
around
tomorrow
at
the
ascension
and
all
that
am
i
going
to
get
to
fight
if
everything
goes
smoothly
you
won't
have
to
but
how
often
do
things
go
smoothly
so
you'll
still
need
me
in
there
always
when
i
was
a
kid
a
couple
of
miles
outside
of
boston
there
was
this
quarry
and
all
the
kids
used
to
swim
there
and
jump
off
the
rocks
and
there
was
this
one
rock
like
forty
feet
up
i
was
the
only
one
that
would
jump
off
it
all
the
older
kids
were
too
scared
not
you
though
naah
i
could
do
it
easy
get
some
rest
good
luck
with
your
spiders
there
they
should
have
all
this
at
the
magic
shop
i
can
run
a
trace
analysis
see
if
it's
a
mystical
poison
i'm
a
little
short
on
cash
just
tell
them
it's
for
me
right
xander
what
are
you
doing
here
i
thought
you'd
be
in
aruba
by
now
hey
i'm
packed
my
car's
right
outside
ii
just
um
ii
had
to
uh
what
you
could
come
with
me
come
with
you
you
mean
that
why
not
we
could
just
get
in
the
car
and
drive
no
one
would
miss
us
we
could
take
turns
driving
keep
each
other
awake
you're
going
to
die
if
you
stay
here
i
guess
i
might
when
i
think
that
something
could
happen
to
you
it
feels
bad
inside
like
i
might
vomit
welcome
to
the
world
of
romance
it's
horrible
no
wonder
i
used
to
get
so
much
work
well
i'm
sorry
i
give
you
barfy
feelings
come
with
me
i
can't
why
not
i
got
friends
on
the
line
so
that
humanity
thing's
still
a
work
in
progress
isn't
it
are
you
really
going
to
be
that
much
help
to
them
i
mean
you'll
probably
just
get
in
the
way
your
stock
is
plummeting
here
sweetheart
fine
you
know
what
i
hope
you
die
aren't
we
gonna
kiss
it'll
be
okay
you'll
be
okay
did
you
reach
the
council
yes
they
they
couldn't
help
couldn't
wouldn't
it's
not
council
policy
to
cure
vampires
did
you
explain
that
these
were
special
circumstances
not
under
any
circumstances
and
yes
i
did
try
to
convince
them
try
again
buffy
they're
very
firm
we're
talking
about
laws
that
have
existed
longer
than
civilization
i'm
talking
about
watching
my
lover
die
i
don't
have
a
clue
what
you're
talking
about
and
i
don't
care
buffy
we'll
find
a
cure
the
council's
orders
are
to
concentrate
on

orders
i
don't
think
i'm
gonna
be
taking
any
more
orders
not
from
you
not
from
them
you
can't
turn
your
back
on
the
council
they're
in
england
i
don't
think
they
can
tell
which
way
my
back
is
facing
giles
talk
to
her
i've
nothing
to
say
right
now
wesley
go
back
to
your
council
and
tell
them
until
the
next
slayer
comes
along
they
can
close
up
shop
i'm
not
working
for
them
anymore
don't
you
see
what's
happening
faith
poisoned
angel
to
distract
you
to
keep
you
out
of
the
mayor's
way
and
it's
working
you
need
a
strategy
i
have
a
strategy
you're
not
in
it
this
is
mutiny
i
like
to
think
of
it
as
graduation
giles
i
can't
stay
here
any
longer
i'm
gonna
see
if
i
can
help
the
others
of
course
you'll
watch
him
i'll
call
if
there's
any
change
buffy
you
don't
know
what
you're
doing
get
a
job
finding
the
poison
wasn't
that
hard
it's
a
mystical
compound
the
latin
name
translates
roughly
to
killer
of
the
dead
used
on
vampires
and
the
cure
there
aren't
a
lot
of
instances
of
it
being
cured
but
there
are
some
one
or
two
pretty
vague
accounts
how
is
he
hold
it
you
got
something
i'm
not
surebuffy
be
sure
okay
killer
of
the
dead
that's
our
boy
and
here's
a
vamp
that
walked
away
from
it
does
it
talk
about
the
cure
damn
nothing
no
it's
in
here
but
wait
completely
reversed
the
effects
oh
what
come
on
guys
the
suspense
is
killing
angel
the
only
way
to
cure
this
thing
is
to
drain
the
blood
of
a
slayer
good
good
what
did
i
miss
no
it's
perfect
angel
needs
to
drain
a
slayer
then
i'll
bring
him
one
buffy
if
angel
drains
faith's
blood
it'll
kill
her
not
if
she's
already
dead
leasing
agreement
it
should
be
recent
it
won't
be
in
her
name
but
if
the
mayor's
putting
her
up
it
might
be
in
his
maybe
he's
charging
it
to
the
city
right
crossreference
realty
with
municipal
funds
you
wanna
drive
sorry
someone
should
take
over
for
giles
after
a
while
watch
angel

don't
mean
to
play
devil's
advocate
here
but
are
you
sure
you're
up
to
this
it's
time
we're
talking
to
the
death

can't
play
kid

is
how
she
wants

address

good
try

plan

mayor

poison

it
was
wicked
painful
there's
a
cure
