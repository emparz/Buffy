that's
right
big
boy
come
and
get
it
i
got
him
go
any
time
now

he's
getting
away
and
ow
that
really
never
works
are
you
guys
all
right
first
of
all
what
was
with
the
acrobatics
how
did
that
happen
wasn't
andy
hoelich
on
the
gymnastics
team
that's
right
he
was
cheater
okay
and
the
uh
second
problem
i'm
having

well

wwell
the
slayer
always
says
a
pun
oror
a
witty
play
on
words
and
i
think
it
throws
the
vampires
off
and
and
it
makes
them
frightened
because
i'm
wisecracking
okay
i
didn't
really
have
a
chance
to
work
on
that
one
but
you
try
it
every
time
uh
if
i
may
suggest
'this
time
it's
personal'
i
mean
there's
a
reason
why
it's
a
classic
i've
always
been
amazed
with
how
buffy
fought
but

in
a
way
i
feel
like
we
took
her
punning
for
granted
xander
past
tense
rule
oh
sorry
i
just
meant
we
in
the
past
took
it
for
granted
and
uh
we
won't
when
she
gets
back
do
you
think
buffy
knows
school's
starting
tomorrow
tomorrow
right
big
day
oh
i'm
gonna
be
busy
a
lot
but
but
only
till
3
and
that's
when
you
usually
get
up
i
can't
wait
to
see
cordelia
i
can't
believe
i
can't
wait
to
see
cordelia
i
wonder
what
our
first
homework
assignment's
gonna
be
hey
you're
excited
over
cordelia
okay
we've
all
got
issues
i
guess
we
should
pack
it
in
yeah
wouldn't
it
be
great
if
buffy
just
showed
up
tomorrow
like
nothing
happened
she
can't
just
show
up
she
got
kicked
out
well
yeah
ii
know
i
just
wish
i
wish
we
knew
where
she
was
how
did
you
find
me
here
if
i
was
blind
i
would
see
you
stay
with
me
forever
that's
the
whole
point
i'll
never
leave
not
even
if
you
kill
me
anything
else
that'll
do
us
peaches
pay
at
the
counter
sure
you
don't
want
me
to
work
it
off
for
you
you
guys
ready
yeah
i
think
we're
good
um

'anne'
what'll
you
have
well
okay
what
can
we
get
with
this
um

can
we
get
cake
don't
be
stupid
we
gotta
eat
healthy
we
can't
have
cake
can
we
get
pie
we've
got
a
peach
pie
i
can't
guarantee
there's
a
peach
in
it
we
shouldn't
have
blown
all
our
money
come
on
it
was
worth
it
hey
check
this
out
it's
nice
it's
nice
and
uh
permanent
yeah
forever
i
mean
that's
the
whole
point
hey
do
i
know
you
i
don't
think
so
really
where're
you
from
i'll
get
your
pie
i'm
not
feeling
great
do
you
think
you
can
cover
for
me
sure
okay
so
no
joy
at
the
cemetery
no
he
got
away
we
still
have
some
glitches
in
the
system
like
vampires
getting
away
but
i
think
we're
improving
for
god's
sake
be
careful
i
mean
uh
i
appreciate
your
efforts
to
keep
the
vampire
population
down
until
buffy
returns
but
uh
well
if
anything
should
happen
to
you
and
you
should
be
killed
i
should
take
it
somewhat
amiss
you'd
be
cranky
entirely
well
we
try
not
to
get
killed
that's
part
of
our
whole
mission
statement
'don't
get
killed'
she
takes
the
books
and
stacks
them
together
again
good
good
i
think
you're
going
to
love
that
one
hi
hey
willow
how
was
your
summer
oh
i
can't
believe
you
brought
that
up
las
palmas
was
the
nightmare
resort
they
order
you
around
and
make
you
have
organized
'fun'
and
i
used
sarcastic
quote
marks
plus
the
fact
there
are
cockroaches
in
mexico
big
enough
to
own
property
it
was
all
about
dread
how
was
your
summer
oh
it
was
okay
is
xander
around
well
uh
yeah
somewhere
good
great
i
haven't
seen
him
yet
do
i
look
okay
oh
yeah
how's
my
hair
uh
it's
good
he
didn't
meet
anybody
over
the
summer
did
he
no
who's
he
gonna
meet
in
sunnydale
but
monsters
and
stuff
but
then
again
he's
always
been
attracted
to
monsters
how's
my
hair
still
good
hi
maybe
he's
forgotten
me
well
i'll
just
have
to
make
him
remember
see
ya
you
came
to
visit
me
you
came
with
books
are
they
books
for
me
well
actually
they're
kind
of
for
me
i
don't
get
it
well
it's
sort
of
a
funny
story
you
remember
when
i
didn't
graduate
well
i
know
you
had
a
lot
of
incompletes
but
that's
what
summer
school
was
for
yeah
well
you
remember
when
i
didn't
go
whoa
slow
down
people
summer
is
over
but
you
never
said
anything
how
am
i
supposed
to
react
to
this
rather
alarming
news
well
actually
i
was
pretty
much
banking
on
you
finding
it
cute
well
traditionally
you
know
repeating
a
grade
isn't
exactly
a
turnon
aand
you're
practically
a
genius
you're
mr
test
scores
iit's
all
a
little
weird
so
the
cute
thing
is
out
have
you
guys
seen
cordelia
yeah
she's
around
here
somewhere
i
don't
want
to
come
on
too
geeky
but
uh
okay
i'm
psyched
there's
gonna
be
some
heat
if
you
know
what
i
mean
so
you
guys
might
want
to
duck
and
cover
and
i'm
starting
to
be
geeky
okay
bye

my
willow
your
hair
is
fine
cool
this

our
year

telling
you
best
football
season
ever
i'm
so
in
shape
i'm
a
rock
it's
all
about
egg
whites
if
we
can
focus
keep
discipline
and
not
have
quite
as
many
mysterious
deaths
sunnydale
is
gonna
rule
i'm
trying
to
get
to
cute
really
but
i'm
still
sorta
stuck
on
'strange'
well
i'd
be
willing
to
bargain
down
to
'eccentric'
with
an
option
on
'cool'
hey

was
all
right
cool
yeah
well
i'll

off
a
group
of

just
you
get

other
time
lily
raises
her
hands
and
waves
off
the
offer
no
it's
okay
it's
okay
forget
about
it
just
a
homeless
man
rudely
pushes
his
way
between
them

two
girls
both
stare
after
him
that's
not
very
polite
are
you
okay
i'm
no
one

didn't
see
you

call
an
ambulance
no
i'm
okay
i
just
i
need
to
go
whoa
oh

where
are
you
running
to
sorry
maybe
i
should
ask
where
are
you
running
from
you're
pretty
new
around
here
uh
you've
got
the
'look'
though
the
'look'
like
you
had
to
grow
up
way
too
fast
what's
your
name
anne
hey
um
i'm
ken
here
go
ahead
take
one
of
these
don't
be
shy
about
stopping
by
i
mean
i
guess
you're
not
starving
but
we're
not
just
interested
in
feeding
the
body
you
might
find
something
you're
missing
i'm
alright
then
why
are
you
here
this
is
not
a
good
place
for
a
kid
to
be
you
get
old
fast
here
the
thing
that
drains
the
life
out
of
them
is
despair
i
mean
kids
come
here
and
they
got
nothing
to
go
home
to
and
this
ends
up
being
the
last
stop
for
a
lot
of
them
shouldn't
have
to
be
that
way
ooooooooo
on
my
way
to
freedom
a
woman
alone
in
the
street
a
boy
and
girl
huddling
together
on
the
curb
a
young
boy
begging
from
a
businessman
who
rejects
him
as
he
walks
by
a
woman
with
a
dirty
face
looking
into
the
camera
i
ask
myself
cut
to
the
bronze
bellylove
is
on
stage
performing
their
ballad
why
did
i
come
again
to
find
my
own
way
to
freedom
the
camera
pans
from
above
down
to
the
singer
then
over
to
the
guitar
player
and
the
change
is
gonna
come
i'm
gonna
find
my
way
find
my
way
find
my
way
back
to
freedom
the
camera
pans
around
behind
the
singer
showing
the
people
in
the
club
it's
not
a
busy
night
xander
is
lounging
on
a
couch
off
to
the
side
willow
is
sitting
in
the
loveseat
set
at
a
right
angle
to
the
couch
i'm
gonna
find
my
way
find
my
way
find
my
way
find
my
way
back
to
freedom
the
camera
cuts
closer
to
xander
and
willow
boy
i'm
glad
we
showed
up
for
depressing
night
willow
i
wonder
what
she's
doing
right
now
oh
i
know
what
she's
doing
gabbing
to
all
of
her
friends
about
her
passionate
affair
with
pedro
the
cabana
boy
laughing
about
me
thinking
how
she
still
might
have
feelings
about
me
oh
it's
possible
you
were
talking
about
buffy
it's
possible
the
bronze
just
never
seems
the
same
without
her
yeah
and
the
slaying
isn't
getting
any
easier
either
i
don't
know
i
think
we're
kinda
getting
a
rhythm
down
we're
losing
half
the
vamps
yeah
but
rhythmically
we
just
need
to
work
on
our
timing
i
think
no
i
know
what
we
need
a
vampire
slayer
next
best
thing
oooooo
my
own
way
to
freedom
xander
bait
uh
hello
hello
um
may
i

oh
uh
of
course
come
on
in
thank
you
i've
uh
just
come
back
from
oakland
a
friend
of
mine
called
with
a
lead
stories
about
someone
fighting
vampires
it
uh
didn't
pan
out
i'm
afraid
no
buffy

vampires
bunch
of
school
kids
in
heavy
mascara
listening
to
extremely
silly
music
well
thank
you
for
going
i
can
hardly
uh

i
can
hardly
leave
the
house
i'm
just
afraid
she'll
call
and
she'll
need
my
help
buffy
is
the
most
capable
child
i've
ever
known
i
mean
she
may
be
confused
uunhappy
but
i
uh
honestly
believe
she's
in
no
danger
i
just
wish
i
could
talk
to
her
the
last
thing
we
did
was
fight
joyce
you
mustn't
blame
yourself
for
her
leaving
i
don't
i
blame
you
you've
been
this
huge
influence
on
her
guiding
her
you
had
this
whole
relationship
with
her
behind
my
back
i
feel
like
you've
taken
her
away
from
me
i
didn't
make
buffy
who
she
is
and
who
exactly
is
she
buffum
anne
can
i
talk
to
you
look
this
really
isn't
a
good
time
can
it
wait
rickie's
gone
i
haven't
seen
him
for
more
than
a
day
ihe's
never
left
for
that
long
i
think
something's
happened
maybe
something's
happened
well
did
you
call
the
police
rickie
skipped
out
on
his
parole
uh
they
would
just
cause
more
trouble
i
don't
know
did
you
did
you
ask
around
can
you
help
me
uh
ii
can't
but
but
that's
who
you
are
and
stuff
right
i
mean
you
help
people
and
you
know
buffy
i
can't
get
into
this
i'm
sorry
lily
you
you
know
how
to
do
stuff
i
don't
not
anymore
but

i
don't
know
what
to
do
we
gave
blood
lots
of
times
'cause
you
get
a
few
bucks
and
they
have
cookies
you're
a
fan
of
the
sugar
rush
it's
nice
hi
you
here
to
donate
blood
uh
we're
looking
for
a
friend
rickie
t
we
come
in
sometimes
rickie
sure
uh
he's
not
here
well
do
you
know
if
he's
been
in
the
last
day
or
so
well
let
me
check
the
sheet
ow
this'll
probably
go
faster
if
we
split
up
can
i
come
with
you
okay
where
did
i
lose
you
on
the
whole
splitting
up
thing
oh
sorry
i
was
thinking
we
could
check
out
some
of
your
hangouts
and
um
i
guess
meet
later
at
my
place
okay
sorry
guys
he
hasn't
been
here
thanks
i'll
tell
him
you
were
looking
great
rickie
did
you
find
rickie
i
thought
ofwell
he
likes
to
go
to
this
movie
house
you
can
get
in
around
the
back
buffy
lily
i
think
he's
dead
but
he
takes
care
of
me
i'm
sorry
we're
gonna
get
a
place
his
cousin
can
get
him
a
job
at
the
car
wash
lily
there's
there's
something
else
the
the
person
that
i
found
was
old
hehe
looked
about
eighty
well
that's
not
rickie
i'm
sure
it
was
i
i
don't
know
how
but
it
was
like
something
drained
the
life
out
of
him
do
you
mean
like
a
vampire
no
a
vampire
couldn't
accelerate
the
aging
process
maybe
it
was
something
in
his
blood
when
was
the
last
time
you
guys
gave
blood
together
i
don't
understand
maybe
it's
not
rickie
okay
lily
this
is
something
you're
just
gonna
have
to
deal
with
but
he
didn't
do
anything
wrong
why
would
this
happen
to
him
that's
not
the
point
these
things
happen
all
the
time
you
can't
just
close
your
eyes
and
hope
that
they're
gonna
go
away
is
it
'cause
of
you
what
you
know
about
monsters
and
stuff

a
big
square
handing
out
leaflets
about

a
real
thing

like
despair
and
hope

fill
up
a
part
of
you
that's
missing
but
rickie

private
files
candidate

i'm
calling
the
police

are
you're
getting
yourself
in
a
lot
of
trouble
i
don't

any
trouble
i
just
want
to
be
alone
and
quiet
in
a
room
with
a
chair
and
a
fireplace
and
a
tea
cozy
i
don't
even
know
what
a
tea
cozy
is
but
i
want
one

i
am
more
than
willing
to

just
i
give
him
the
names
of
the
healthy
ones

you
don't
want

wear
your
own
outfit

the
cleansing
a
cleansing

like
a
baptism
right

same
will

this
station
to
wash
away
the
past
go
ahead

we
let
the
water
run
over
the
sin
and
the
pain
and
the
uncertainty
it
looks
kinda
dirty
yeah
you
know
i
just
i
woke
up
and
i
looked
in
the
mirror
and
i
thought
hey
what's
with
all
the
sin
i
need
to
change
i'm
i'm
dirty
i'm
i'm
bad
with
the
sex
and
the
envy
and
that
that
loud
music
us
kids
listen
to
nowadays
w
oh
i
just
suck
at
undercover
where's
ken
this
is
a
private
moment
if
you
could
just
buffy
how
do
you
make
'em
old
ken
do
you
feed
on
youth
what's
the
deal
do
you
really
wanna
know
what's
going
on
lily
oh

oh
my
face
ow
my
face
do
you
have
any
idea
how
hard
it
is
to
glue
that
thing
on
guards
welcome
to
my
world
i
hope
you
like
it
you're
never
leaving
let
me
just
ask
you
one
thing
how
long
did
it
take
you
to
forget
me
were
you
still
taxiing
down
the
runway
or
was
it
actually
in
the
cab
oh
yeah
mr
faithful
you
probably
met
up
with
some
hot
little
inca
mummy
girl
yeah
i
heard
about
her
help
xander
oh
unh

lily
i
always
knew
i
would
come
here
sooner
or
later
i
knew
i
belonged
here
where
hell
this
isn't
hell
isn't
it
unh

what
is
hell
but
the
total
absence
of
hope
the
substance
the
tactile
proof
of
despair
you're
right
lily
this
is
where
you've
been
heading
all
your
life
just
like
rickie
rickie
he
forgot
you
well
it
took
him
a
long
time
he
remembered
your
name
years
after
he'd
forgotten
his
own
but
in
the
end
lily
years
but
ken
oh
uh
interesting
thing
time
moves
more
quickly
here
than
in
your
reality
a
hundred
long
years
will
pass
here
on
earth
it's
just
a
day
so
you
just
work
us
till
we're
too
old
and
spit
us
back
out
that's
the
plan
see
lily
you'll
die
of
old
age
before
anyone
wonders
where
you
went
not
that
anyone
will
that's
why
we
chose
you
you
didn't
choose
me
no
but
i
know
you
anne
so
afraid
so
pathetically
determined
to
run
away
from
whatever
it
is
you
used
to
be
to
disappear
congratulations
you
got
your
wish
you
work
and
you
live
that
is
all
you
do
not
complain
or
laugh
or
do
anything
besides
work
whatever
you
thought
whatever
you
were
does
not
matter
you
are
no
one
now
you
mean
nothing
who
are
you
aaron
who
are
you
no
one
who
are
you
no
one
who
are
you
i'm
buffy
the
vampire
slayer
and
you
are
anyone
who's
not
having
fun
here
follow
me
there's
no
way
we
can
get
back
up
there
without
meeting
new
people
okay
lily
when
those
guards
leaveand
they
will
leavei
want
you
to
take
these
people
and
get
them
up
there
okay
fast
and
quiet
you're
leaving
me
but
buffy
lily
you
can
handle
this
'cause
i
say
so
we've
gone
public
okay
quick
get
them
up
go
quiet
i'm
sorry
i
said
this
was
your
fault
before
lily
this
can
wait
well
in
case
we
die
buffy
go
go
get
out
of
the
way
come
on
get
out
of
the
way
c'mon
c'mon
everybody
go
go
humans
don't
fight
back
humans
don't
fight
back
that's
how
this
works
get
down
there
one
of
you
fights
and
you
all
die
that
was
not
permitted
yeah
but
it
was
fun
you've
got
guts
i
think
i'd
like
to
slice
you
open
and
play
with
them
let
everyone
know
this
is
the
price
of
rebellio
lily
pushes
him
from
behind
and
he
falls
screaming
from
the
high
ledge
to
the
floor
below
the
guards
holding
buffy
just
watch
as
he
hits
bottom
with
a
loud
thud
buffy
gives
lily
a
surprised
look
and
then
quickly
takes
advantage
of
the
distraction
and
backhand
punches
her
captors
one
in
the
face
and
the
other
in
the
groin
while
the
second
one
is
dazed
she
shoves
her
weight
against
him
and
he
falls
backward
onto
a
barrel
the
first
one
punches
high
but
she
blocks
grabs
his
arm
and
flips
him
over
onto
a
pile
of
burlap
sacks
buffy
jumps
up
onto
the
pile
and
steps
across
her
fallen
attacker
he
tries
to
grab
her
but
misses
she
jumps
high
into
the
air
and
grabs
hold
of
a
heavy
chain
hanging
from
above
she
climbs
it
handoverhand
as
quickly
as
she
can
to
the
ledge
where
lily
is
still
standing
the
two
of
them
run
through
the
door
and
quickly
find
their
way
to
the
others
struggling
with
a
heavy
iron
gate
they'll
be
coming
okay
this
works
the
abs
and
the
glutes
i'm
gonna
feel
this
for
a
week
you've
ruined
you

hey
ken
wanna
see
my
impression
of
gandhi
gandhi
well
you
know
if
he
was
really
pissed
off
what
do
we
do
about
with
a
flash
of
light
the
pool
mysteriously
tiles
itself
over
to
match
the
tiles
along
the
edges
it
now
appears
to
be
a
sixinch
deep
empty
ceremonial
pool

two
girls
just
stare
at
it
in
wonder
let
me
give
you
the
tour

concludes
our
tour

really
nice
