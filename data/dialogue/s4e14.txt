so
maggie
sends
me
down
into
the
sewers
with
one
of
those
blastoguns
and
the
next
thing
i
know
it's
raining
monsters
hallelujah
and
then
this
gate
slams
down
behind
me
and
i
try
to
use
the
gun
but
it
goes
phitt
giles
you're
saying
that
maggie
walsh
set
you
up
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying
she
sent
me
on
a
wayone
recon
gotta
hand
it
to
you
goldilocks
you
do
have
bleeding
tragic
taste
in
men
i
got
a
cousin
married
to
a
regurgitating
frovalox
demon
that's
got
better
instincts
than
you
what
does
my
taste
in
men
have
to
do
with
this
do
you
think
riley
was
out
knitting
booties
for
your
future
offspring
while
maggie
was
stringing
you
up
you
guys
think
riley
had
something
to
do
with
this
probably
not
but
uh
we'd
be
remiss
if
we
didn't
think
of
all
the
possibilities
right
remiss
no
no
maggie
made
sure
he
was
no
where
around
when
she
sent
me
on
this
very
special
make
buffy
dead
assignment
and
plus
riley
he
seems
like
he
wouldn't
tell
a
little
white
lie
let
alone
a
whole
bunch
of
big
dirty
ones
that's
why
they
call
it
the
secret
forces
will
'cause
they
kinda
keep
the
whole
lying
thing
to
themselves
all
i
know
is
that
maggie
has
it
in
for
me
which
means
the
initiative
has
it
in
for
me
i'm
guessing
the
mad
scientist
isn't
too
keen
on
the
fact
that
the
entire
scooby
gang
knows
that
the
initiative
is
up
to
no
good
which
brings
us
back
to
the
not
safe
for
any
of
us
concept
what
could
have
happened
to
make
professor
walsh
want
to
kill
you
i
don't
know
uh
she
wasn't
keen
on
the
fact
that
i
was
asking
a
lot
of
questions
that's
for
sure
so
you
were
getting
too
close
to
something
clearly
although
one
can
only
imagine
what
she'd
be
so
desperate
to
hide
okay
everybody
grab
a
weapon
we
gotta
move
and
storm
the
initiative
yeah
let's
take
on
those
suckers
i
was
thinking
more
that
we'd
hide
oh
thank
god
buffy
i
think
perhaps
we
should
talk
about
this
we
need
to
relocate
some
place
where
we're
less
likely
to
be
found
we
need
to
come
up
with
a
plan
we
could
go
to
my
place
the
initiative
guys
know
how
close
we
are
they'll
automatically
check
the
places
you
hang
out
xander
what
about
your
basement
the
guys
haven't
seen
us
together
that
much
and
there's
enough
room
oh
plus
mirror
ball
cool
come
on
down
and
boogie
at
xander's
hideaway
yes
come
boogie
absolutely
not
i
will
not
squat
in
that
dank
whole
what
it
was
good
enough
for
me
but
you're
above
it
all
precisely
besides
i
don't
see
why
we
can't
stay
right
where
we
are
because
it's
very
unlikely
those
initiative
boys
are
gonna
come
around
here
looking
for
the
front
door
opens
and
riley
steps
inside
buffy
god
buffy
are
you
okay
what
happened
you
know
i
know
something
went
down
tell
me
maggie
tried
to
kill
me
it
didn't
work
but
they're
all
upset
anyway
okay
listen
i
need
you
to
go
over
everything
step
by
step
there
has
has
to
be
some
kind
of
mistake
there
was
no
mistake
and
how
do
you
know
something
happened
i
was
on
a
mission
but
i
came
back
and
i'm
not
sure
look
let's
just
keep
our
heads
and
not
jump
to
any
what
that's
hostile
17
uh
no
i'm
just
a
friend
of
xanderrr's
bugger
it
i'm
your
guy
this
is
spike
he's
uh
it's
a
really
long
story
but
he's
not
bad
anymore
hey
what
i
am
a
bleeding
broken
record
i'm
bad
it's
just
i
can't
bite
anymore
thanks
to
you
wankers
we've
been
looking
all
over
the
place
for
him
but
you've
known
where
he's
been
all
along
it's
not
like
that
then
what
is
it
like
what's
he
doing
here
leaving
you
swabs
to
your
dramatics
thanks
i've
got
my
stories
on
the
telly
for
that
by
the
by
if
you're
trying
to
kill
her

buffy
what
is
this
you're
hiding
an
hst
why
don't
you
just
back
off
and
let
her
ask
the
questions
jack
your
boss
just
tried
to
make
monster
food
out
of
her
ii
didn't
see
much
i
wasn't
there
i
all
i
know
is
professor
walsh
told
me
you
were
dead
but
then
i
saw
you
on
the
monitors
look
this
isn't
professor
walsh
there
must
be
something
making
her
act
this
way
something
i
i
don't
know
controlling
her
we
think
buffy
may
have
been
becoming
too
in
inquisitive
that
she
was
getting
close
to
something
that
professor
walsh
was
trying
to
hide
any
idea
what
that
might
be
what
about
314
maybe
that's
it
maybe
she
was
trying
to
test
you
what
if
it
was
only
a
drill
then
why
did
she
tell
you
i
was
dead
riley
it
wasn't
a
test
see
i've
heard
rumors
that
the
initiative
wasn't
all
that
we've
been
told
that
uh
secretly
they're
working
towards
some
darker
purpose
something
that
might
harm
us
all
no
that's
that's
not
what
happens
there
riley
i
would
know
look
no
one
is
sure
of
anything
okay
we're
just
trying
to
sort
it
out
i
can't
be
here
i'll
sort
it
out
on
my
own
riley
no
just
i'm
sorry
what
am
i
you're
a
monster
i
thought
so
what
are
you
me
i'm
a
boy
a
boy
how
do
you
work
i
don't
know
i
just
do
what's
that
for
dr
walsh
adam
that
would
never
happen
well
no
buff
that's
why
they
call
them
cartoons
not
documentaries
must
we
have
the
noise
my
head
is
splitting
well
look
who's
cranky
bear
in
the
morning
yes
i
can't
imagine
why
i
didn't
sleep
well
in
my
beach
ball
every
time
you
moved
it
made
squeaky
noises
it
was
irritating
really
i'm
surprised
you
could
hear
it
over
your
wagnerian
snoring
okay
you
guys
could
we
not
please
everything's
screwed
up
enough
without
you
two
doing
scenes
from
my
parents'
marriage
sorry
sorry
thank
you
it'll
be
okay
buffy
riley's
just
confused
that's
all
i
don't
know
it
just
seems
like
things
can
get
heavier
his
whole
world's
falling
apart
and
after
everything
you've
been
through
with
angel
you
know
you
really
should
get
yourself
a
boring
boyfriend
like
xander
you
can't
have
xander
that
was
the
idea
riley
was
supposed
to
be
mr
joe
guy
we
were
gonna
do
dumb
things
like
hold
hands
through
the
daisies
going
tra
la
la
poor
buffy
your
life
resists
all
things
average
so
dump
him
but
you
can't
have
xander
i'll
try
and
remember
that
it's
too
late
anyway
i'm
already
at
the
i
hurt
when
he
hurts
i
smile
when
he
smiles
stage
i
hate
that
part
i'll
just
have
to
make
it
work
turn
on
the
tv
now
sunnydale
is
still
reeling
from
news
of
the
crime
a
source
in
the
coroner's
office
tells
us
that
the
boy
was
stabbed
with
what
looks
like
some
kind
of
large
skewer
and
his
body
was
then
mutilated
police
have
not
named
a
suspect
and
the
killer
is
still
at
large
the
polgara
demon
had
a
skewer
in
its
arm
that's
the
one
maggie
insisted
we
bring
back
alive
she
must
have
sent
it
after
you
and
it
got
distracted
god
buffy
it's
not
your
fault
how
could
you
know
she's
right
you
mustn't
blame
yourself
i'm
not
going
to
i'm
going
to
the
crime
scene
to
see
what
i
can
find
out
you
guys
research
the
polgara
demon
i
want
to
know
where
it
is
when
i
find
it
i
am
going
to
make
him
pay
for
taking
that
kid's
life
i'll
make
him
die
in
ways
he
can't
even
imagine
that
probably
would
have
sounded
more
commanding
if
i
wasn't
wearing
my
yummy
sushi
pajamas
hey
where
you
been
all
night
well
congratulations
i
see
you
and
buffy
have
finally
gotten
past
the
shy
phase
i
wasn't
with
buffy
i
needed
to
be
alone
think
some
things
through
what
things
this
is
mighty
ominous
what's
up
man
professor
walsh
tried
to
have
buffy
killed
what
did
buffy
tell
you
that
i
mean
do
you
have
any
proof
i
saw
enough
to
know
it's
true
i
don't
get
it
why
i
don't
know
buffy
thinks
that
she's
getting
too
close
to
something
that
professor
walsh
has
some
secret
i
wouldn't
put
it
past
buffy
to
get
on
professor
walsh's
bad
side
she
tends
to
put
her
nose
where
it
doesn't
belong
what
she's
a
pain
always
wanting
to
know
why
this
and
why
that
and
you're
saying
she
should
die
because
of
that
i
don't
know
maybe
professor
walsh
found
out
that
buffy
was
up
to
something
bad
that
ever
cross
your
mind
why
does
it
bug
you
so
much
that
i'm
hanging
with
her
is
it
because
she's
a
better
soldier
than
you
it
bugs
me
that
she's
using
you
to
infiltrate
our
operations
so
you're
saying
she's
a
spy
you're
crazy
riley
think
about
it
the
professor
is
not
stupid
if
she
tried
to
kill
buffy
maybe
buffy
needed
killing
guys
not
now
graham
what
is
it
professor
walsh
is
dead
look
at
that
wound
she's
been
staked
wouldn't
you
say
brother
what
only
one
person
i
can
think
of
who
could
do
something
like
that
you
better
not
be
saying
what
i
think
you're
saying
wewe
don't
know
that
a
person
did
this
the
polgara
demon
has
a
skewer
that
comes
right
out
of
no
way
that's
your
girlfriend's
mo
hey
that's
a
serious
accusation
you
better
be
ready
to
deal
with
the
consequences
then
bring
'em
on
that
supernatural
freak
has
blinded
you
and
i'm
sick
of
it
that's
enough
stand
back
show
some
respect
listen
everybody's
upset
but
arguing
isn't
going
to
help
anything
and
it's
certainly
not
what
professor
walsh
would
want
no
sir
all
right
good
now
washington
is
sending
in
a
team
to
do
an
internal
investigation
i've
been
told
we
have
to
wait
for
their
word
what
do
you
mean
wait
this
has
to
be
the
work
of
the
polgara
demon
we
captured
last
week
probably
looks
like
last
night
the
polgara
escaped
through
tunnel
seventytwo
it's
out
loose
somewhere
i'm
afraid
so
then
we
have
to
go
after
it
my
orders
from
washington
are
for
a
total
lockdown
until
they
arrive
i'm
sorry
now
return
to
your
quarters
there's
nothing
you
can
do
here
listen
angleman
can
talk
all
he
wants
but
i'm
still
in
charge
until
the
brass
gets
here
and
tells
me
otherwise
i
say
we
got
a
demon
to
hunt
now
suit
up
for
armed
patrol
and
by
that
i
mean
loaded
guns
man
target
practice
is
over
we're
going
for
blood
somebody's
been
staying
here
what
do
think
a
homeless
guy
could
be
or
a
squatter
of
the
demon
variety
but
not
the
polgara
who
cares
i
see
a
demon
it
dies
it's
warm
damn
animals
buffy
hey
hey
look
i'm
sorry
about
earlier
i
know
everyone
came
on
pretty
strong
and
the
spike
thing
isn't
as
tweaked
as
it
looked
okay
maybe
it
is
but
there's
an
explanation
that
almost
makes
sense
hello
i'm
apologizing
here
and
i
think
that's
pretty
big
of
me
considering
i'm
the
one
who
was
almost
made
a
demon
sandwich
this
is
the
part
where
you
throw
me
a
bone
maggie's
dead
happy
now
how
can
you
ask
me
that
of
course
i'm
not
happy
what
happened
that's
classified
classifi
the
polgara
it
got
her
and
escaped
didn't
it
i'm
gonna
find
it
i'm
gonna
find
it
and
destroy
it
and
then
you
can
stop
asking
me
how
happy
all
this
death
makes
me
howdy
i
just
got
your
message
a
minute
ago
i
was
in
class
but
i
was
about
to
call
you
i
had
so
much
fun
the
other
night
the
spells
yeah
that
was
nice
i
hope
you
don't
think
that
i
just
come
over
for
the
spells
and
everything
i
mean
i
really
like
just
talking
and
hanging
out
with
you
and
stuff
i
know
that
but
you
want
to
do
a
spell
yeah
but
only
because
it's
really
important
there's
this
no
you
don't
have
to
explain
i
don't
mind
really
i've
been
um
thinking
about
that
last
spell
we
did
all
day
you
have
well
this
one
should
be
fun
too
we
conjure
the
goddess
thespia
to
help
us
locate
demonic
energy
in
the
area
it
shouldn't
be
too
tricky
the
goddess
thespia
are
you
sure
we're
ready
for
that
you
and
me
this
is
beneath
us
okay
if
you
say
so
you're
killing
me
here
oh
i
missed
you
too

joint's
jumping
yeah

know
making
some
changes
with
my
life

away
from
my
old
image

as
a
doubledealing
snitch
uhhuh
i
know
you
gonna
think
i'm
blowing
smoke
but
after
those
apocalypse
demons

did
me
in
i
had
an
experience
of
the
spiritual
variety
that's
swell
really
but
i
need
to
know
if
you've
heard
anything
about
a
polgara
demon
doing
some
killings
in
the
last
few
of

whatever
you
are
leave
him
alone
riley
he's
human

he's
human

of
what
happened

professor
walsh

see
it
now
let
go
of
me
hold
it
you
no
leaving
until
i
say
so
got
it
hey
we
got
new
rules
here
no
killing
right
except
the
rules
don't
seem
to
apply
much
these
days
do
they
like
if
i
shot
you
right
now
i
don't
know
if
i'd
have
a
corpse
on
my
hands
or
one
pissed
off
vampire
riley
i
mean
who
do
you
believe
first
it
sounds
like
lies
then
it
sounds
like
truth
riley

what's
happening
to
me
riley
why
don't
you
lie
down
you'll
be
more
comfortable
stop
it
i
can't
it's
like
something's
growing
inside
no
you're
hurting
yourself
c'mere
okay
shh
i
thought
i
knew
but
i
don't
i
don't
know
anything
shh
you're
sick
once
you
get
some
rest
no
buffy
i
don't
know
anything
i
don't
know
which
team
i'm
on
who
the
bad
guys
are
maybe
i'm
the
bad
guy
maybe
i'm
the
thing
you
should
kill
no
don't
you
even
think
that
okay
listen
to
me
you're
sick
you
just
need
to
get
some
sleep
please
lie
down
for
me
come
on
you're
gonna
be
okay
how
is
he
this
isn't
just
grief
making
him
act
this
way
something's
effecting
him
physically
and
it's
getting
worse
you
think
professor
walsh
did
something
to
him
i
don't
know
but
i'm
ready
to
find
out
that's
gonna
be
tough
what
with
maggie's
deadness
and
all
she
must
have
kept
records
somewhere
aabout
riley
about
314
about
all
of
it
and
i'm
sure
she
wasn't
the
only
person
that
knew
what
she
was
up
to
so
what's
the
plan
giles
anya
keep
researching
xander
you
and
i
are
going
undercover
hey
remember
before
no
xander
not
in
a
boyfriend
way
or
a
lead
him
to
a
certain
death
way
he's
the
only
one
with
military
experience
it's
not
like
he
was
in
the
'nam
he
was
gi
joe
for
one
night
it's
okay
anya
i've
backed
up
buffy
before
can't
you
do
something
else
to
help
them
like
xerox
handouts
or
something
i'll
be
careful
promise
it's
a
minor
point
but
how
do
you
plan
to
get
in
to
the
initiative
i'm
sure
their
security
system's
almost
impenetrable
i
have
my
clearance
i'm
hoping
she
didn't
have
time
to
revoke
it
okay
well
as
for
the
whereabouts
of
this
polgara
demon
i'm
afraid
we've
we've
not
turned
up
much
there've
been
no
reports
since
its
original
capture
then
we'll
just
have
to
keep
looking
so
the
square
is
sunnydale
right
it's
like
a
map
we
both
take
different
parts
of
the
potion
and
when
we
do
the
incantation
we
both
blow
it
onto
the
square
at
the
exact
same
time
but
how
does
it
work
well
that's
the
cool
part
when
the
potion
mixes
and
thespia's
called
it
creates
this
mist
over
the
parts
where
the
demons
are
iit
even
makes
different
colors
for
different
breeds
wow
you
ready
let's
do
it
thespia
we
walk
in
shadow
walk
in
blindness
you
are
the
protector
of
the
night
thespia
goddess
ruler
of
all
darkness
we
implore
you
open
a
window
to
the
world
of
the
underbeing
with
your
knowledge
may
we
go
in
safety
with
your
grace
may
we
speak
of
your
benevolence
or
not
seems
pretty
quite
it
usually
is
this
time
of
buff
maybe
you
should
check
the
look
later
shh
oww
what'd
you
do
that
for
sorry
i'm
the
only
one
that
can
pass
the
retinal
scan
the
re
eww
i
don't
wanna
see
that
retinal
scan
xander
well
we'll
know
in
a
few
seconds
if
my
clearance
is
still
good
or
if
we're
about
to
die
at
the
hands
of
fifty
grieffilled
military
goons
retinal
scan
recorded
summers
buffy
why
am
i
not
entirely
comforted
by
the
arrival
of
the
mansized
microwave
holy
moly
i
know
i
totally
get
it
now
can
i
have
sex
with
riley
too
quick
pretend
to
make
out
with
me
what
what
are
you
talking
about
well
i
uh
you
know
in
the
movies
the
guy
and
the
girl
have
to
hide
please
could
you
possibly
draw
more
attention
to
us
this
is
the
initiative
xander
military
guys
and
scientists
do
not
make
out
with
each
other
well
maybe
that's
what's
wrong
with
the
world
ever
think
about
that
it
totally
failed
it
wasn't
even
like
the
spell
went
wrong
it
just
wouldn't
if
it's
any
consolation
we
haven't
fared
much
better
here
really
is
riley
okay
well
hhe's
asleep
finally
but
he
doesn't
look
good
and
the
uh
research
is
troubling
as
well
i
mean
thisthis
demon
we're
after
seems
highly
atypical
for
a
polgara
this
child
that
it
killed
was
mutilated
there's
no
recorded
cases
of
a
polgara
ever
having
done
such
a
thing
also
the
polgara
have
to
eat
every
two
hours
factor
in
the
low
iq
and
you
have
a
demon
who's
not
exactly
low
profile
so
how
has
he
been
hiding
out
in
sunnydale
for
the
last
two
days
without
anyone
seeing
him
exactly
riley
where's
buffy
she
went
out
cancan
i
get
you
something
just
tell
me
where
she
is
you're
not
well
riley
yyou
need
to
rest
did
she
find
the
polgara
well
no
we're
still
looking
but
but
what
she
went
to
find
out
what's
making
you
sick
i'm
not
sick
you're
telling
me
she
went
to
the
initiative
riley
she's
just
trying
to
help
you
she
doesn't
belong
there
riley
listen
stand
away
from
the
stairs
no
you're
gonna
get
buffy
killed
hey
you
all
right
how
many
of
the
men
are
still
out
the
longer
they
go
without
their
meds

everyone's
off
their
schedules
because
of
the
professor's
death
it's
dangerous
i
don't
want
to
think
about
the
damage
our
guys
could
do
under
the
stress
of
withdrawal
especially
since
they
won't
understand
what's
happening
to
them
these
guys
don't
know
they've
been
getting
meds
in
their
food
so
we
better
get
them
in
here
stat
we've
located
all
but
a
few
the
last
ones
were
in
pretty
bad
shape
but
we
stabilized
them
but
finn
wasn't
one
of
them
right
no
find
him
he's
the
one
i
care
about
he's
too
important
to
the
work
to
lose
now
indeed
doubleshot
of
oneg
'keep
and
make
it
the
good
stuff
i
don't
want
no
freaking
orangutan
got
ya
been
a
pisser
of
a
day
isn't
it
those
army
blokes
are
on
a
tear
they
ran
me
outta
my
place
and
all
over
town
yeah
what's
that
keep
me
posted
i'll
be
in
records
he
walks
away
and
the
other
scientist
heads
in
the
other
direction
now
i
don't
generally
like
to
kill
humans
but
i've
learned
that
it
pays
to
be
flexible
in
life
i
was
wondering
when
you'd
turn
up
oh
darn
so
this
isn't
a
surprise
now
you
can
tell
me
what
you
did
to
riley
and
after
that
we
can
take
a
tour
of
room
314
somebody's
coming
you
know
i'm
sure
they've
already
seen
you
on
the
security
monitors
monitors
are
nonfunctional
at
this
time
sir
went
down
about
ten
minutes
ago
what
i
didn't
do
that
thank
god
for
small
favors
and
we'll
worry
about
details
later
huh
buff
finn
take
this
girl
to
the
stockade
immediately
riley
he
can
tell
us
what
we
need
to
know
maggie
wanted
me
dead
didn't
she
she
did
but
understand
the
initiative
has
no
interest
in
eliminating
the
slayer
it
was
her
own
vendetta
why
spell
it
out
for
me
i
feel
an
attack
of
dumb
blonde
coming
on
i
don't
know
well
think
harder
it
was
the
project
project
314
it

it
escaped
that's
enough
you're
making
her
sound
like
some
psychopath
she
wasn't
like
that
she
was
a
brilliant
woman
she
was
iit's
not
riley
all
she
was
doing
was
trying
to
help
people
and
this
is
the
way
you
want
them
to
remember
her
angleman
said
walsh
was
feeding
you
drugs
you're
doing
this
to
me
aren't
you
this
all
started
because
of
you
look
if
you
will
just
listen
to
me
okay
i
am
trying
to
help
you
get
to
the
truth
you
want
truth
then
tell
me

what
did
you
do
to
her
buffy
stop
it
i
didn't
do
anything
riley
stop
this
isn't
about
us
everything
that
we
need
to
know
is
here
we
just
need
to
find
out
what
was
in
314
me
i've
been
thinking
about
the
world
i
wanted
to
see
it
learn
it
i
saw
the
inside
of
that
boy
and
it
was
beautiful
but
it
didn't
tell
me
about
the
world
it
just
made
me
feel
so
now
i
want
to
learn
about
me
why
i
feel
what
i
am
so
i
came
home
i'm
a
kinematically
redundant
biomechanical
demonoid
designed
by
maggie
walsh
she
called
me
adam
and
i
called
her
mother
adam
maggie
would
want
you
to
stand
down
yes
but
i
seem
to
have
a
design
flaw
in
addition
to
organic
material
i'm
equipped
with
gp2d11
infrared
detectors
a
harmonic
decelerator
plus
dc
servo
she
pieced
you
together
from
parts
of
other
demons
and
man
and
machine
which
tells
me
what
i
am
but
not
who
i
am
mother
wrote
things
down
hard
data
but
also
her
feelings
that's
how
i
learned
that
i
have
a
job
here
and
that
she
loved
me
she
wasn't
your
mother
and
she
didn't
love
you
is
that
really
the
issue
she
made
you
because
she
was
a
scientist
rileeey
riley
finn
stop
those
files
oh
mother
created
you
too
maggie
is
not
my
mother
i
have
a
mother
a
real
a
birth
mother
yes
but
after
you
met
maggie
she
was
the
one
who
shaped
your
basic
operating
system
she
taught
you
how
to
think
how
to
feel
she
fed
you
chemicals
to
make
you
stronger
your
mind
and
body
she
said
that
you
and
i
were
her
favorite
children
her
art
that
makes
us
brothers
family
no
i'm
not
like
you
that's
pain
isn't
it
why
because
your
feeding
schedule
the
chemicals
have
been
interrupted
or
do
you
miss
her
tell
me
i'll
kill
you
you
won't
you
haven't
been
programmed
to
i
cannot
be
programmed
i'm
a
man
it's
here
the
plan
she
had
for
us
what
happens
how
it
ends
no
do
you
want
to
hear
no
doctor
thank
you
this
has
been
very
interesting
back
away
from
the
door
riley
are
you
okay
secure
the
room
go
go
we
got
a
demon
in
here
it
escaped
through
that
vent
it's
not
the
polgara
it
looks
sort
of
half
man
right
and
you
just
happened
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
she's
telling
the
truth
i
saw
it
it
killed
angleman
go
now
yes
sir
he
needs
to
go
to
a
hospital
we'll
take
it
from
here
i'm
going
with
him
it's
a
military
hospital
no
back
off
we
take
care
of
our
own
around
here
understand
buffy
escort
them
out
buffy
what
did
you
expect
spike
a
welcome
party
word's
out
you've
been
making
war
on
the
demon
world
war
with
the
slayer
you
kill
other
demons
and
the
rest
of
us
don't
hold
with
that
still
if
i
see
you
around
here
again
i'll
be
inclined
to
break
that
code
do
you
understand
no
word
from
riley
nothing
the
initiative
probably
has
him
locked
in
some
medical
ward
there's
no
way
i
can
get
near
him
until
i
come
up
with
a
better
plan
than
just
storming
in
and
getting
us
all
shot
yeah
you
might
want
to
work
the
kinks
out
of
that
one
what
am
i
going
to
do
he
needs
me
and
i
can't
get
near
him
you'll
find
a
way
it's
not
like
i
can
spend
all
of
my
energy
going
after
the
initiative
not
while
adam's
out
there
he's
really
that
big
of
a
threat
i
could
barely
fight
him
iit
was
like
maggie
designed
him
to
be
the
ultimate
warrior
he's
smart
and
fast
he
gave
the
commando
guys
the
slip
with
no
problem
there's
gotta
be
a
flaw
i
think
the
part
where
he's
pure
evil
and
kills
randomly
was
an
oversight
i
never
should
have
let
them
take
riley
i
need
to
be
with
him
i'm
sure
he's
okay
there's
no
way
he
can
be
everything
he's
ever
believed
in
has
been
taken
away
or
he's
alone
he
has
nothing
to
hold
on
to
cut
to
the
corridors
of
the
initiative
commandos
and
scientists
are
going
about
business
as
usual
one
commando
is
standing
guard
at
a
closed
door
dissolve
to
interior
and
the
camera
pans
across
the
medical
room
where
we
see
riley
lying
on
a
bed
his
abdomen
is
wrapped
heavily
in
bandages
a
small
red
stain
over
his
wound
he's
still
sweating
a
little
but
no
longer
seems
agitated
he's
staring
at
the
wall
