chloe
it
is
chloe
right
it's
not
enough
i'm
a
bright
girl
good
education
quick
on
the
uptake
so
tell
me
why
in
the
name
of
almighty
grothnar
would
i
let
myself
become
human
again
you're
really
talking
to
the
wrong
fella
i
mean
sure
the
vengeance
demon
gig
has
some
downsides
all
jobs
do
but
being
human
ugh
you're
always
icky
on
the
inside
disgusting
on
the
outside
your
outside's
not
so
bad
you
know
the
only
thing
worse
than
being
human
is
being
trapped
inside
a
house
full
of
humans
preaching
to
the
choir
luv
i
mean
it's
like
we
live
in
slayer
central
i
swear
if
buffy
rooms
or
boards
one
more
of
the
potential
girls
i'm
gonna
call
a—i'm
gonna
call
a
health
inspector
i
like
my
plan
better
get
up
get
out
get
drunk
repeat
as
needed
it's
just
more
elegant
thanks
for
having
me
along
don't
mention
it
at
first
i
thought
it's
weird
is
spike
asking
me
out
on
a
date
'cause
that
would
just
be
nuts
right
i'm
just
out
for
the
alcohol
right
there
with
you
scooter
tonight
i
plan
to
drink
you
under
the
table
you're
on
then
good
of
course
once
you're
down
there
i
could
join
you
kidding
i
like
my
sex
on
top
of
the
table
would
you
let
it
go
you're
like
a
dog
with
a
bone
so
what
it's
my
bone
just
drop
it
ok
ok
i
wasn't
proposing
time
goes
by
girl
gets
hungry
you
should
know
oh
thank
god
what
demon
huh
d'hoffryn
says
you
die
of
course
he
does
oh
hey
this
may
mean
more
than
you
think
is
that
so
because
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
a
couple
of
chuckleheads
who
thought
that
a
cafeteria
fist
fight
would
impress
i'm
not
impressed
buffy
are
you
impressed
still
i'm
gonna
cut
you
guys
some
slack
this
time
third
fight
this
week
and
it's
just
getting
worse
plus
a
rise
in
vandalism
three
students
missing
tell
me
something
buffy
in
your
professional
opinion—
it's
started
hasn't
it
the
hellmouth
has
begun
its
semiannual
percolation
usually
it
blows
around
may
was
it
like
this
before
i
mean
it
just
seems
to
me
as
if
things
are
getting
bad
faster
than
we
thought
we're
a
little
ahead
of
schedule
i
can't
say
i'm
too
surprised
i
knew
i
signed
on
for
something
but
buffy
i'm
just
a
guy
granted
a
cool
and
sexy
vampirefighting
guy
but
still
don't
forget
snappy
dresser
mm
thank
you
but
this
is
gonna
get
bigger
than
me
yeah
it
is
that's
why
i've
decided
to
give
you
this
what
is
it
an
emergency
kit
this
bag
belonged
to
my
mother
a
slayer
keepsake
ii
couldn't
well
you
have
to
technically
it
should
have
been
passed
down
directly
to
you
through
the
years
but
after
my
mother
died
i
guess
i
just
couldn't
part
with
it
wow
i
don't
know
what's
inside
exactly
but
i
know
it
has
something
to
do
with
her
power
well
your
power
now
ii
don't
know
what
to
say
try
saying
thank
you
principal
wood
thank
you
principal
wood
ah
call
me
robin
now
i'd
like
to
see
where
you
work
uh
here
actually
uh
ththis
is
my
desk
and
uh
these
are
my
pencils
no
where
you
do
your
other
work
so
all
the
potential
slayers—who
seem
to
keep
popping
up
from
like
every
corner
of
the
earth—
were
getting
killed
by
the
first
agents
of
we
thought
the
council
could
protect
them
but
unfortunately
no
one
was
protecting
the
council
and
all
their
watchers
were
killed
word
got
out
and
they've
all
been
coming
here
since
well
there's
nothing
like
the
end
of
the
world
to
bring
people
together
it's
heartwarming
anyway
this
is
uh
it
command
central
where
the
hell
have
you
been
this
funnel
cake
is
kicking
my
ass
yeah
i
hear
they're
tricky
robin
wood
this
isandrew
it's
a
pleasure
andrew
is
our—actually
he's
our
hostage
i
like
to
think
of
myself
more
as
a
guestage
so
you—you
hold
him
here
against
his
will
well
he
was
evil
and
people
got
killed
and
now
hebakes
it's
a
thing
oh
could
we
try
to
just
keep
our
secret
headquarters
a
little
bit
secret
keep
bringing
people
in
they're
gonna
see
everything
they'll
see
the
big
board
andrew
we
don't
have
a
big
board
i
uh
made
it
myself
oh
i
wouldn't
have
guessed
uh
this
is
us
and
this
represents
the
first
in
various
incarnations
and
uh
there's
no
pattern
to
the
naked
eye
yet
but
the
instant
one
emerges
yours
truly
is
on
it
where
do
we
put
our
receipts
you'll
have
to
forgive
andrew
or
not
your
call
we
do
have
a
lot
more
working
for
us
than
just
the
uh
big
board
so
i
see
huh
punch
block
combo
huh
cross
block
kick
huh
chamber
your
energy
punch
block
combo
hold
it
what
the
hell
do
you
call
that
potential
try
that
in
the
field
you
are
dead
drop
and
give
me
20
20
what
pushups
maggot
i
love
this
job
did
you
see
that
i
called
that
girl
maggot
hi
who
the
hell
are
you
an
ally
so
what
do
you
think
my
girls
ready
to
kick
some
ass
or
what
looking
strong
but
well
i'm
just
not
sure
the
first
has
an
ass
that
you
can
actually
you
know
kick
guess
we'll
see
principal
wood
hi
it's
so
weird
seeing
you
outside
of
school
what
are
you
waving
at
potential
attention
huh
rising
sun
begin
you're
right
it's
not
enough
that's
not
what
i
said
buffy
it's
an
impressive
group
of
recruits
they're
not
recruits
recruits
arerecruited
these
girls
were
chosen
you're
doing
the
best
you
can
with
what
you've
got
they're
not
all
gonna
make
it
some
will
die
and
nothing
i
can
do
will
stop
that
oh
hi
hey
well
buffy
i—i
see
that
our
preparation
for
the
schoolpepdancecheerdrill
contest
are
coming
along
bring
it
on
it's
ok
i
filled
him
in
on
everything
oh
thank
god
if
i
had
to
explain
all
these
weapons
i
had
nothing
buffy
tells
me
you
have
been
um—oh
how
shall
i
put
it—experimenting
with
the
magicks
oh
yeah
oh
nothing
too
heavy
though
just
the
lighter
safer
stuff
uh
if
kennedy
asks
her
pointy
stuff's
right
there
see
you
inside
so
much
cooler
than
snyder
she
really
almost
destroyed
the
world
yep
remind
me
not
to
make
her
crabby
it
might
be
better
if
you
did
how's
that
work
oh
i
don't
know
it's
just—the
first
is
coming
and
then
look
at
us
the
army
we've
got
a
bunch
of
fighters
with
nothing
to
hit
a
wicca
who
won'ta
and
the
brains
of
our
operation
wears
oven
mitts
hm
well
you're
redefining
the
job
buffy
and
that
takes
guts
this
isn't
your
full
arsenal
anyway
show
me
the
vampire
but
you
just
let
him
go
after
saving
your
life
for
now
that
was
one
of
d'hoffryn's
killers
spike
he
won't
stop
coming
'til
he
kills
me
yet
here
you
are
walking
talking
annoying
but
you
fought
like
such
a
wimpire
what
with
the
lifting
and
the
running
why
not
just
kill
him
anya
think
i
fight
demon
boy
gets
lucky
i
get
knocked
out
you
get
killed
true
we
both
know
the
safest
and
sanest
way
of
saving
your
life
was
to
keep
you
with
me
away
from
danger
no
need
to
thank
me
i'm
just
the
one
who
beat
him
off
repelled
him
would
perhaps
be
the
better
phrase
demon
figured
i
hope
we're
not
intruding
not
a
bit
and
just
what
brings
our
good
principal
to
this
neck
of
the
gloom
i'm
showing
him
our
operation
us
fine
by
me
big
fight
against
evil
coming
up
the
more
good
guys
we've
got
the
longer
we'll
all
live
is
that
what
you
are
a
good
guy
i
haven't
heard
any
complaints
well
i
have
heard
a
few
complaints
over
the
years
but
then
i
just
killed
whoever
spoke
up
and
that
was
pretty
much
that
he's
joking
no
he's
not
no
i'm
not
butthat's
the
old
me
i'm
talking
about
why
don't
you
tell
me
about
that
not
much
to
tell
i've
changed
oh
now
that
you
have
a
soul
yeah
that
was
a
big
deal
very
private
what
are
you
just
telling
everyone
now
oh
come
on
spike
don't
blame
buffy
i
asked
right
the
educator
yeah
i
went
to
great
lengths
lots
of
trouble
and
now
i'm
unique
well
more
or
less
got
myself
a
soul
whatever
that
means
and
how's
that
working
out
for
you
in
progress
well
you've
had
some
time
you've
been
in
sunnydale
what
years
how
many
a
few
before
that
around
i
think
we'd
better
get
back
upstairs
right
give
him
the
full
tour
you
don't
want
to
miss
a
look
at
her
weapons'
chest
so
i
took
a
look
inside
that
emergency
bag
of
principal
wood's
and
smelled
weird
kinda
like
grandma's
closet
but
worse
i
didn't
know
what
was
possible
anything
we
could
use
trinkets
weapons
one
very
large
textbook
translation's
gonna
be
a
bitch
but
do
you
know
that
ancient
sumerians
do
not
speak
english
they're
worse
than
the
french
anything
else
uh
yeah
a
box
a
big
fat
unopenable
box
i'm
betting
whatever
the
big
deal
about
this
emergency
bag
is
you'll
find
it
in
the
box
good
keep
on
it
don't
you
have
any
real
homework
oh
you
mean
like
schoolwork
yes
well
i've
got
a
system
it's
called
flunking
out
no
just
kidding
i'm
paying
someone
to
do
my
work
i'm
kidding
i
love
to
see
your
eyeballs
change
color
when
you
think
i'm
gonna
flunk
out
of—
what
happened
we
heard—
dawn
get
a
knife
we're
cutting
her
down
good
thinking
but
on
the
other
hand
why
rush
up
or
down
i'll
still
be
dead
you're
not
chloe
yeah
well
neither
is
she
anymore
now
she's
just
chloe's
body
what
did
you
do
to
her
nothing
we
just
talked
all
night
well
i
did
most
of
the
talking
but
chloe
isi'm
sorry
was
a
good
listener
'til
she
hanged
herself
like
when
you
called
her
maggot—she
really
heard
that
don't
listen
to
it
any
of
you
it's
the
first
oh
let
'em
the
only
reason
why
chloe
offed
herself
is
'cause
she
knew
what
you're
not
getting
i'm
coming
you're
going
all
this—it's
almost
over
we'll
be
here
all
of
you
but
wait
i
thought—
they're
not
all
gonna
make
it
some
will
die
and
there's
nothing
i
can
do
that
will
stop
it
hey
i
didn't
say
it
but
i'll
be
seeing
all
of
you
one
by
one
ttfn
what's
ttfn
it's
ta
ta
for
now
it's
what
tigger
says
when
he
leaves
chloe
loved
winnie
the
pooh
dawn
where's
that
knife
is
everyone
here
all
accounted
for
anyone
want
to
say
a
few
words
about
chloe
let
me
chloe
was
an
idiot
chloe
was
stupid
she
was
weak
and
anyone
in
a
rush
to
be
the
next
dead
body
i
bury
it's
easy
justthink
of
chloe
and
do
what
she
did
and
i'll
find
room
for
you
next
to
her
and
annabelle
i'm
the
slayer
the
one
with
the
power
and
the
first
has
me
using
that
power
to
dig
our
graves
i've
been
carrying
you—all
of
you—too
far
too
long
ride's
over
you're
out
of
line
no
she's
not
you're
gonna
let
her
talk
to
you
like
that
willow
she's
not
even
the
most
powerful
one
in
this
room
with
you
here
she's
not
close
you're
new
here
and
you're
wrong
because
i
use
the
power
that
i
have
the
rest
of
you
are
just
waiting
for
me
well
yeah
but
only
because
you
kinda
told
us
to
you're
our
leader
buffy
as
in
follow
the
well
from
now
on
i'm
your
leader
as
in
do
what
i
say
ja
wohl
but
let's
not
try
to
forget
we're
also
your
friends
i'm
not
then
why
are
you
here
aside
from
getting
rescued
what
is
it
that
you
do
i
provide
muchneeded
sarcasm
um
that
would
kinda
be
my
job
actually
you're
here
because
you're
scared
same
goes
for
everyone
in
this
room
fine
anya
all
of
you
be
as
scared
as
you'd
like
just
be
useful
while
you're
at
it
come
on
buffy
you
know
everyone
here's
doing
everything
they
can
the
first
isn't
impressed
it
already
knows
us
it
knows
what
we
can
do
and
it's
laughing
you
want
to
surprise
the
enemy
surprise
yourselves
force
yourself
to
do
what
can't
be
done
or
else
we
are
not
an
army—we're
just
a
bunch
of
girls
waiting
to
be
picked
off
and
buried
where
are
you
going
out
since
i'm
neither
a
girl
nor
waiting
all
this
speechifying
doesn't
really
apply
to
me
does
it
fine
take
a
cell
phone
that
way
if
i
need
someone
to
get
weepy
or
whaled
on
i
can
call
you
if
you've
got
something
to
say—
just
said
it
you
keep
holding
back
you
might
as
well
walk
out
that
door
holding
back
you're
blind
i've
been
here
right
in
it—fighting
scrapping
since
you
got
your
soul
back
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
haven't
quite
been
relishing
the
kill
the
way
i
used
to
you
were
a
better
fighter
then
i
did
this
for
you
the
soul
the
changes—it's
what
you
wanted
what
i
want
is
the
spike
that's
dangerous
the
spike
that
tried
to
kill
me
when
we
met
oh
you
don't
know
how
close
you
are
to
bringing
him
out
i'm
nowhere
near
him
dawn
get
the
potentials
upstairs
and
break
out
that
emergency
kit
what
are
you
gonna
do
i'm
declaring
an
emergency
we
thought
you'd
want
to
be
here
yeah
you
thought
right
that
emergency
bag's
got
some
neat
stuff
in
it
weapons
charms
advanced
reading
assignments
yeah
cool
stuff
but
we've
seen
it
all
before
well
not
this
we
haven't
what's
inside
it
mm
i
don't
know
it
hasn't
been
opened
since—
well
since
now
puppets
that's
it
the
first
hates
puppets
now
if
we
can
just
airlift
kermit
fozzie
the
bear
and
miss
piggy
into
town
the
first'll
be
arunning
those
are
muppets
and
these
things
are
shadowcasters
you
put
them
in
motion
and
they
tell
you
a
story
it
says
you
can't
just
watch
you
have
to
see
what
the
hell
does
that
mean
it's
cryptic
i
don't
like
it
every
time
instructions
get
cryptic
someone
gets
hurt—usually
me
you
can't
just
watch
you
have
to
see
see
what
that's
where
all
my
fancy
translating
skills
break
down
but
i
think
it's
an
origin
myth
the
story
of
the
very
first
slayer
ii
saw
her
you
saw
the
first
slayer
the
other
night—in
my
dream
it's
gotta
mean
something
right
ok
according
to
this
i
think—you
put
on
those
puppet
guys
one
by
one
they
cast
shadows
and
the
shadows
tell
the
story
first
there
is
the
earth
what's
that
sound
ok
so
far
so
creepy
hmm
ok
then
there
came
the
demons
after
demons
there
came
men
men
found
a
girl
and
the
men
took
the
girl
to
fight
the
demon—all
demons
they—they
chained
her
to
the
earth
and
then—and
i—i
can't
read
this
something
about
darkness
what
about
darkness
it
says
you
cannot
be
shown
you
cannot
just
watch
but
you
must
see
see
for
yourself
but
only
if
you're
willing
to
make
the
exchange
when
did
you
get
so
good
at
sumerian
it's
not
in
sumerian
anymore
but
what
does
it
mean
it
means
i
have
to
go
in
there
no
it
doesn't
where
does
it
say
that
it
doesn't
say
that
buffy
you
don't
even
know
what
you're
exchanging
you
don't
know
if
you're
ready
yet
that's
the
point
no
buffy
we
don't
know
where
you're
going
or
how
we'll
get
you
back
buffy
you
can't
how
will
we
get
you
back
find
a
way
she's
gone
huh
what
was
that
about
an
exchange
ah
this
must
be
the
exchange
student
willow
use
your
magic
send
him
back
um
trying
redi
weapons
get
out
of
here—all
of
you
unless
you
want
to
end
up
all
dead
and
useless
what
are
you
gonna
do
what
i
do
best
are
you
injured
just
hurt
don't
make
a
case
out
of
it
how
'bout
you
i
think
we'll
live
except
maybe
spike
is
getting
thrown
through
the
ceiling
what
he
does
best
i'll
go
check
on
him
we've
got
bigger
problems
than
that
yeah
demon
loose
no
slayer
we
need
buffy
you
gotta
get
her
back
looks
like
it's
spell'o'clock
which
spell
i
mean
didn't
you
see
that
thing
and
you
expect
to
reopen
the
portal
without
sending
willow
off
the
deep
end
thanks
for
your
support
well
it's
true
we're
going
to
have
to
find
another
way
there
isn't
and
buffy
knew
it
i've
got
to
get
her
back
we
don't
even
know
where
she
went
well
guess
that
worked
dawnie
what's
the
book
say
not
much
once
buffy
left
it
got
a
little
tougher
to
read
oh
it's
ok
we'll
just
start
with
what
we
know
and
take
it
from
there
great
so
far
we
know
jack
about
squat
let's
go
from
there
you've
got
the
magic
use
it
iii
don't
even
know
what
magic
to
use
why
not
just
try
all
32
flavors
worst
thing
that
happens
is
you
go
brunette
that's
not
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
she's
right
and
you
know
we
have
a
choice
we
can
risk
willow's
life
and
the
rest
of
our
lives
to
get
buffy
back
or
we
leave
her
out
there
if
we
play
it
safe
back
here
buffy
could
stay
lost
you
missed
her
everyone
sucks
but
me
speech
if
she's
so
superior
let
her
find
her
own
way
back
anya
the
first
is
already
up
and
running
every
second
that
buffy's
not
here
is
an
opportunity
for
it
to
show
up
and
rip
us
to
pieces
willow
how
would
you
get
buffy
back
that's
what
i'm
saying—i
don't
even
know
ok
but
if
another
witch
was
to
do
it
where
would
she
start
uh
physics
principles
basic
laws
such
as
uh
conservation
of
energies
you
can't
really
create
or
destroy
anything
only
transfer
i'm
sorry
are
you
helping
no
but
at
least
i'm
not
galloping
off
in
the
wrong
direction
magic
works
off
physics
not
without
a
catalyst
if
you're
talking
about
transferring
energies
you
need
some
kind
of
conduit
like
aa
kraken's
tooth
yeah
skin
of
draconis
um
ground
up
baltic
stones
something
ok
good
plus
we
need
an
exchange
like
you
said
i'm
thinking
a
slayer
for
a
demon
right
if
we
want
buffy
back
then
we
have
to
find
that
demon
and
send
it
through
it
matter
if
it's
dead
or
alive
i
vote
dead
the
slayer's
counting
on
you
willow
get
cracking
on
that
portal
and
don't
be
stingy
with
the
mojo
the
demon's
mine
hate
to
say
it
big
bad
but
you
look
like
you
can
barely
stand
we're
trained
and
the
only
thing
we
know
for
sure
about
this
demon
is
it
kicked
your
ass
it
did
at
that
where
are
you
going
something
i
need
hello
i'm
buffy
i'm
the
slayer
subtitle
we
know
who
you
are
subtitle
and
we
know
why
you're
here
subtitle
we've
been
waiting
good
that's
good
then
um
you
know
i
know
we
have
bigger
issues
to
deal
with
but
how'd
i
understand
anything
you
guys
just
said
oh
i
know
ancient
magicks
i
just
thought
it
was
neat
subtitle
we
have
been
here
since
the
beginning
subtitle
now
we
are
almost
at
the
end
the
neat
of
it
just
left
end
of
what
subtitle
you
are
the
hellmouth's
last
guardian
latest
you
mean
latest
guardian
subtitle
no
ok
um
i
have
a
first
to
fight
ok
so
just
tell
me
what
i
need
to
know
i
came
to
learn
subtitle
we
cannot
give
you
knowledge
only
power
you
know
what
i
think
i'm
not
really
here
at
all
none
of
this
is
actually
happening
this
is
like
a
play
like
some
shadowplay
some
nonreality
reenactment
hologramy—
and
this
is
gonna
help
us
how
the
sand
forms
a
circle
the
circle
acts
as
a
barrier
and
the
barrier
contains
the
portal
now
what
we
hold
hands
and
chant
kumbaya
or
something
maybe
'til
we
get
the
magicks
up
and
running
i'm
kinda
working
on
my
best
guess
here
will
maybe
we
should
wait
for
what
spike—to
see
if
he
can
bring
back
that
demon
no
i
don't
think
we
should
wait
right
now
opening
a
portal
this
size
could
take
days
better
get
started
i
think
i
might
pee
my
pants
you
can
do
it—the
magicks
not
the
pants
thing
ok
via
temporis
iam
clamo
ad
te
via
spatii
te
jubeo
aperire
aperi
dawnie
you'd
better
put
on
some
coffee
this
could
take
awhile—
what
is
this
subtitle
we
are
at
the
beginning
the
source
of
your
strength
the
well
of
the
slayer's
power
subtitle
this
is
why
we
have
brought
you
here
i
thought
i
brought
me
here
listen
you
guys
i'm
already
the
slayer
bursting
with
power
really
don't
need
any
more
subtitle
the
first
slayer
did
not
talk
so
much
subtitle
herein
lies
your
truest
strength
subtitle
the
energy
of
the
demon
its
spirit
subtitle
its
heart
this
is
how
you—
subtitle
created
the
slayer
yes
subtitle
it
must
become
one
with
you
no
subtitle
this
will
make
you
ready
for
the
fight
by
making
me
less
human
subtitle
this
is
how
it
was
then
how
it
must
be
now
subtitle
this
is
all
there
is
make
this
stop
subtitle
this
is
what
you
came
for
no
this
isn't
the
way
subtitle
do
not
fight
this
where
you
going
got
a
job
nice
coat
where'd
you
get
it
new
york
via
concursus
tempus
spatium
audi
me
ut
imperio
screw
it
mighty
forces
i
suck
at
latin
ok
but
that's
not
the
issue
i'm
the
one
in
charge
and
i'm
telling
you
open
up
portal
now
it's
not
happening
will
give
her
time
she's
getting
it
or
something's
getting
her
will
think
you
better
back
up
a
little
no
oh
come
on
now
nancy
call
yourself
a
demon
i
thought
you
were
up
for
a
proper
fight
now
we're
talking
yeah
you
think
i
came
all
this
way
to
get
knocked
up
by
some
demon
dust
i
can't
fight
this
i
know
that
now
but
you
guys
you're
just
men
just
the
men
who
did
thisto
her
whoever
that
girl
was
before
she
was
the
first
slayer
subtitle
you
don't
understand
no
you
don't
understand
you
violated
that
girl
made
her
kill
for
you
because
you're
weak
you're
pathetic
and
you
obviously
have
nothing
to
show
me
i
don't
know
your
feelings
big
guy
but
to
me
a
tussle
like
that
is
good
for
the
soul
i
knew
it
it's
always
the
staff
subtitle
we
offered
you
power
tell
me
something
i
don't
know
subtitle
as
you
wish
hey
you
ok
you've
been
kinda
quiet
since
you
sucked
the
life
out
of
me
yeah
since
then
look
it's
important
that
you
know
what
i
am
what
i'm
like
when
i'm
like
that
i
thought
it
would
be
i
don't
know—cool
somehow
it
just
hurt
i'm
really
sorry
it's
just
you
were
the
most
powerful
person
nearby
and—well
that's—that's
how
it
works
that's
how
i
work
i
got
that
you
told
me
i'll
see
you
in
the
morning
how
you
doing
thanks
for
bringing
me
back
again
well
that's
what
i
do
i
was
hard
on
you
guys
today
aw
it's
all
right
you
needed
to
be
although
twinkies
and
kisses—also
peachy
motivational
tools
you
ok
i
think
i
made
a
mistake
what
those
men
that
i
met—you
know
the
shadow
men
they
offered
me
more
power
but
i
didn't
like
the
loophole
so
you
turned
it
down
it's
ok
buffy
we'll
get
by
we
always
do
i
don't
know
they
showed
me
showed
you
what
that
the
first
slayer
was
right—it
isn't
enough
why
buffy
what
did
you
see
what
did
they
show
you
