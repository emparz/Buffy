buffy
parker
stay
down
buffy
buffy
i
don't
know
what
to
say
after
the
way
i've
treated
you
and
now
i
owe
you
my
life
it's
nothing
it's
everything
you're
everything
and
i'm
going
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
get
you
to
forgive
me
do
you
think
one
day
you
might
noooo
these
are
the
things
we
want
simple
things
comfort
sex
shelter
food
we
always
want
them
and
we
want
them
all
the
time
the
id
doesn't
learn
it
doesn't
grow
up
it
has
the
ego
telling
it
what
it
can't
have
and
it
has
the
superego
telling
it
what
it
should
want
but
the
id
works
solely
out
of
the
pleasure
principle
it
wants
whatever
social
skills
you've
learned
however
much
we've
evolved
the
pleasure
principal
is
at
work
in
all
of
us
so
how
does
this
conflict
with
the
ego
manifest
itself
in
the
psyche
what
do
we
do
when
we
can't
have
what
we
want
buffy
i
don't
know
what
to
say
after
the
way
i've
treated
you
and
now
i
owe
you
my
life
can
you
ever
forgive
me
rough

essential
part
of
your
collegy

on
the
townie

the
new
bartender
over
at
the
pub
got
my
lighter
my
rag
my
empathy
face
aren't
you
two
young
to
be
a
bartender
oh
contraire
mon
frere
mon
frere
means
brother
mon
girlfrere
behold
behold
i
don't
believe
this
is
entirely
on
the
up
and
up
what
gives
it
away
looking
at
it
well
no
one's
going
to
see
it
anyway
now
i'm
the
bartender
i
kick
people
out
you
know
there's
more
to
it
than
wiping
and
kicking
mixing
drinks
for
instance
well
i've
seen
cocktail
i
can
do
the
hippyhippy
shake
well
even
if
i've
had
a
pretend
cigarette
i
couldn't
tell
you
my
pretend
problems
the
real
ones
have
clogged
up
my
headspace
ooh
unload
em
right
here
baby
rough
day
you
wanna
talk
about
it
shutting
up
now
i'm
pregnant
by
my
stepbrother
who'd
rather
be
with
my
best
friend
whose
left
me
with
no
place
to
live
no
food
except
this
bottle
of
wild
turkey
which
i
drank
all
up
that
was
me
being
tanked
and
friendless
for
ya
gets
my
oscar
nod
you
know
what
it's
class
time
so
are
you
going
to
come
by
tonight
to
the
pub
oz
bronze
date
you
know
maybe
maybe
he's
just
having
trouble
dealing
i
mean
don't
guys
sometimes
put
the
girl
they
really
really
like
inside
these
deep
little
brain
fantasy
bubbles
where
everything's
perfect
they
do
that
right
how's
that
fugue
state
coming
along
parker
maybe
i'm
in
his
bubble
and
then
pretty
soon
he's
going
to
realize
that
he
wants
more
than
just
bubble
buffy
and
he'll
pop
me
out
and
we'll
go
to
dinner
and
it
could
happen
right
buffy
and
as
my
best
friend
you
need
to
stop
thinking
about
parker
he's
no
good
there
are
men
better
men
wherein
the
mind
is
stronger
than
the
penis
nothing
can
defeat
the
penis
too
loud
very
unseemly
i
mean
i'm
sorry
do
be
so
course
but
i
feel
strongly
about
stinky
parker
man
he
can
be
really
sweet
i'm
telling
you
i
think
he
had
intimacy
problems
because
of
the
death
of
his
father
not
interested
you
got
troubles
tell
em
to
the
bartender
that's
right
cause
the
bartender's
always
ready
to
listen
what
what
okay
and
you
had
a
rum
and
coke
and
you
had
a
poker's
light
and
a
vodka
on
the
rocks
and
a
water
is
that
right
do
i
have
to
write
it
down
for
you
a
glass
of
ice
water
a
simple
request
ice
water
a
cold
ale
a
canadian
lager
a
glass
of
white
wine
and
a
daiquiri
ice
water
right
do
you
want
that
on
the
rocks
oooh
riley
i'm
so
sorry
that's
okay
you
know
but
most
people
go
around
i'm
not
saying
you
can't
go
through
me
it's
just
that
the
other
is
much
quicker
in
my
defense
you
do
take
up
a
lot
of
space
i
do
i'm
you
looking
for
someone
um
i
just
saw
parker
over
there
right
parker
and
his
latest
conquest
you
know
that
boy
should
have
he's
kinda
a
girl
chaser
huh
sets
em
up
and
knock's
em
down
i
guess
maybe
i'm
oldfashioned
but
my
father
says
that
if
you
wanna
be
a
gentleman
you
don't
even
care
what
my
father
says
i'm
sorry
what
forget
about
it
you
know
i've
got
some
people
waiting
i'll
see
you
in
class
right
rough
day
nay
it's
been
super
we
accepted
melody's
pledge
and
made
her
an
official
sister
of
beta
delta
gamma
and
our
pins
arrived
today
i
designed
it
myself
you
are
so
sharp
hey
paula
you
keeping
this
fine
bartender
from
his
duty
a
man's
gotta
make
a
living
s'all
right
so
the
guys
and
i
are
about
to
celebrate
uh
i
said
it
was
all
right
i'm
due
for
a
break
oh
so
what
were
you
discussing
maybe
we
could
all
join
be
nice
what
ah
forget
it
oh
no
i
rudely
interrupted
and
it
sounds
like
the
two
of
you
were
having
quite
the
meeting
of
minds
possibly
debating
the
geopolitical
ramifications
of
bioengineering
you
got
a
take
on
that
i've
got
beer
you
want
some
beer
yeah
a
pitcher
of
black
frost
you
see
i
think
we
have
a
perfect
venue
here
for
conducting
a
little
sociometry
a
bipolar
continuum
of
attraction
and
rejection
no
given
your
sociological
statuses
i
foresee
a
b
rejects
a
dyad
i'm
sorry
lemme
clarify
you
see
we
are
the
future
of
this
country
and
you
keep
our
bowl
of
peanuts
full
we
are
what
these
girls
want
and
uh
four
glasses
how's
about
i
see
some
id
cause
you're
not
seeing
a
drop
until
i'm
satisfied
that
just
give
em
a
beer
buffy
rough
day
wanna
tell
me
about
it
it's
just
parker's
problem
with
intimacy
turns
out
to
be
that
he
can't
get
enough
of
it
and
knew
it
i
knew
what
he
was
if
he
were
tied
and
gagged
and
left
in
a
cave
that
vampires
happen
to
frequent
it
wouldn't
really
be
like
i
killed
him
really
buffy
i'm
a
slut
no
idiot
no
you
gotta
stop
being
so
hard
on
hey
sorry
so
sorry
i'm
better
this
has
helped
do
not
go
anywhere
oh
oh
i'm
so
sorry
i
just
keep
running
into
people
today
i
can't
imagine
anybody
minding
you're
not
thinking
about
leaving
are
you
because
we
have
a
strict
policy
against
you
leaving
at
least
until
you've
had
a
drink
yeah
well
what
my
friend
is
just
saying
is
you
shouldn't
be
sad
and
alone
right
now
i
mean
you're
a
very
beautiful
girl
who
should
be
covered
with
men
and
could
we
be
those
men
it's
on
us
hey
you
got
a
table
i
had
to
kill
a
man

go
back
to
your
place
i
could
make
you
soup
no
that's
okay
i'm
fine
thanks

you
know
her
veruca

the
thing
that
the
modern
day
society
failed
to
realize
is
that
all
the
socioeconomical
and
psychological
problems
inherent
in
modern
society
can
be
solved
by
the
judicious
application
of
way
too
much
beer
black
frost
is
the
only
beer
my
mother
always
said
that
beer
was
evil
evil

absolutes

predate
the
absolution
of
malt

it's
time
to
go

buffy
buffy

i've
cut
you

did
it

out
you
go
ow
oh
want
beer
like
beer
beer
good
beer
bad
bad
bad
beer
what
the
hell
am
i
saying
buffy
go
home
and
go
to
bed
say
bye
bye
bye
hey
where'd
girl
go
hey
did
you
want
something
yes
i
wanted
to
give
you
a
piece
of
my
mind
i'm
tired
of
you
men
and
your
manness
buffy's
really
hurting
right
now
in
fact
she's
in
need
of
a
big
mental
tidy
parker
how
could
you
do
this
to
her
oh
i
don't
get
what
you
mean
what
did
i
do
she
shared
something
very
intimate
with
you
and
you
act
like
it's
nothing
more
than
a
bag
of
some
kind
of
snack
food
willow
i'm
not
sure
i
need
to
explain
my
actions
here
but
if
that's
what
you
want
yes
followed
by
an
admission
of
undeniable
guilt
but
go
on
some
relationships
center
on
a
deep
emotional
tie
or
a
loyal
friendship
or
something
but
most
are
just
two
people
passing
through
life
enriching
or
aggravating
each
other's
lives
briefly
go
on
just
for
one
night
can't
two
people
who
feel
an
attraction
come
together
and
create
something
wonderful
and
then
go
back
to
their
lives
the
next
day
better
for
it
but
never
over
analyzing
it
or
wanting
it
to
be
more
than
it
was
i
have
she
should
too
people
like
buffy
aand
me
assume
that
intimacy
means
friendship
and
respect
people
shouldn't
have
to
ask
first
if
you're
going
to
be
eyeing
other
prospects
tomorrow
people
shouldn't
have
to
preface
casual
sex
with
“just
so
you
know
i'll
never
grow
any
older
with
you”
it
takes
the
fire
out
of
it
maybe
willow
i
don't
regret
what
happened
or
what
we
did
but
i
am
sorry
that
buffy's
hurting
and
if
i
mislead
her
than
i'm
sorry
for
that
too
i
didn't
mean
to
i'm
impressed
that
you
care
so
much
about
her
you're
a
good
friend
alright
time
to
pay
up
and
go
home
guys
let's
see
i'll
take
this
one

i've
always

a
problem
calculating

so
dapper
and
brain
maybe
you
can
help
me

right
amount

been
taking
abuse
from
snotnosed
kids
for
twenty
years
they're
always
coming
in
here
with
their
snotty
attitude
drinking
their
fruity
little
micro
brews
and
spouting
out
some
philosophy
like
it
means
a
damn
thing
thinking
they're
different
than
us
xander
they
are
now
they
ain't
that's
the
great
thing
about

makes
all
men

same
why
are
we
talking
about
beer
the
guys

the
pleasure
principle

only
thing
you're
