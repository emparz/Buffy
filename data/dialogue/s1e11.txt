behold
the
weirdness

i'm
doing
with
this
stuff
huh
wow
i'm
not
uh
for
history
class
mr
giles
has
this
like
hobby
of
collecting
stuff
which
he
lent
me
for
show
and
tell
ddid
i
mention
it's
for
history
class
she
is
always
hanging
with
that
creepy
librarian
in
that
creepy
library
hey
did
i
ever
tell
you
about
the
time
that
she
attacked
me
at
the
bronze
i
don't
know
why
this
school
admits
mentals
like
her
'if
you
prick
us
do
we
not
bleed
if
you
tickle
us
do
we
not
laugh
if
you
poison
us
do
we
not
die
and
if
you
wrong
us
shall
we
not
revenge'
okay
so
talk
to
me
people
how
does
what
shylock
says
here
about
being
a
jew
relate
to
our
discussion
about
the
anger
of
the
outcast
in
society
well
how
about
color
me
totally
selfinvolved
care
to
elaborate
yeah
with
shylock
it's
whine
whine
whine
like
the
whole
world
is
about
him
he
acts
like
it's
justice
him
getting
a
pound
of
antonio's
flesh
it's
not
justice
it's
yicky
but
has
shylock
suffered
what's
his
place
in
venice
society
well
everyone
looked
down
on
him
that
is
such
a
twinkie
defense
shylock
should
get
over
himself
people
who
think
their
problems
are
so
huge
craze
me
like
this
time
i
sort
of
ran
over
this
girl

the
most
traumatizing
event
of
my
life
and
she's
trying
to
make
it
about
her

raised
an
interesting
point
here
which
we'll
pursue
at
a
later

the
hat
oh
god

hat
gee
it's
fun
that
we're
speaking
in
tongues
i'm
sorry
it's
just
that
we
had
this
uh
you
had
to
be
there
it's
not
even
funny
really
uh
cordelia
just
has
a
history
of
trying
too
hard
yeah
what
kind
of
moron
would
wanna
be
may
queen
anyway
i
was
you
what
at
my
old
school
oh
so
the
uh
good
kind
of
moron
would
do
that
the
uh
nonmoron
i
mean
well
we
didn't
call
it
'may
queen'
but
we
had
the
coronation
and
the
dance
and
all
that
stuff
it
was
nice
well
you
know
you
don't
need
that
anymore
you
got
us
be
my
deputy
oh
god
guys
c'mon
mitch
got
whaled
on
i
think
he's
dead
of
course
not
what
are
you
ghouls
there
are
no
dead
students
here
this
week
clear
back
make
room
all
of
you
mitch
what
happened
i
don't
know
i
i
heard
something
i
tried
to
grab
a
a
bat
that
hit
me
what
hit
you
the
bat
by
itself
the
thing
was
floating
it
knocked
me
out
i'd
better
check
out
the
scene
where
do
you
think
you're
going
um
mitch
wanted
me
to
get
his
comb
he
he
likes
his
comb
i
don't
think
mitch
needs
his
comb
right
now
i
think
mitch
needs
medical
attention
and
you
need
to
stay
away
from
the
crime
scene
always
sticking
your
nose
in
sue
what
did
you
say
mitch
was
gonna
sue
the
school
sue
who
well
his
dad
is
the
most
powerful
lawyer
in
sunnydale
hold
on
what
have
you
two
heard
his
dad
the
lawyer
you
haven't
heard
of
him
other
lawyers
call
him
'the
beast'
'look'
that's
all
it
said
look
at
what
look
at
mitch
maybe
all
i
know
is
it's
a
message
and
ah
here
you
are
and
monsters
don't
usually
send
messages
it's
pretty
much
crush
kill
destroy
this
was
different
i'd
have
to
say
you're
right
i
love
it
when
he
says
that
any
theories
uh
i'm
uh
it's
a
bit
of
a
puzzle
really
um
i've
never
actually
heard
of
anyone
attacked
by
a
lone
baseball
bat
before
maybe
it's
a
vampire
bat
i'm
alone
with
that
one
huh
well
assuming
the
bat
itself
is
not
possessed
uh
there
are
a
few
possibilities
that
bear
investigating
uh
someone
with
telekinesis
uh
the
power
to
move
objects
at
will
uh
uh
an
invisible
creature
um
or
possibly
a
poltergeist
a
ghost
yes
and
a
very
angry
one
yeah
i'd
say
the
locker
room
was
a
real
scene
if
it's
a
ghost
then
we're
talking
about
a
dead
kid
i
guess
so
you
know
why
don't
you
compile
a
list
of
dead
or
missing
kids
it's
probably
a
good
place
to
start
and
uh
i'll
research
all
the
possibilities
ghosts
included
but
uh
xander
if
you're
not
doing
anything
would
you
like
to
help
me
what
so
there's
homework
now
when
did
that
happen
it's
all
part
of
the
glamorous
world
of
vampire
slayage
well
what
part
do
you
have
gonna
find
out
what
i
can
about
mitch
this
attack
wasn't
random
well
i
want
that
part
fine
you
can
do
it
ask
around
talk
to
his
friends
talk
to
cordelia
talk
to
cordelia
so
research
huh
hi
oh
hi
cordelia
you
weren't
in
fifth
period
i
went
to
the
hospital
oh
mitch
how
is
he
will
he
be
okay
well
the
doctor
says
he'll
be
fine
they're
gonna
send
him
home
tomorrow
but
you
should've
seen
him
lying
there
all
black
and
blue
how's
he
gonna
look
in
our
prom
pictures
how
am
i
ever
gonna
be
able
to
show
them
to
anyone
well
they
can
do
wonderful
things
with
airbrushes
these
days
you
think
hi
hi
did
you
see
mitch
he
just
broke
up
with
wendy
eight
seconds
ago
and
he's
already
nosing
around
it's
shameless
in
the
spring
if
he
makes
varsity
baseball
maybe
i'll
take
him
on
a
test
drive
hi
guys
what
do
you
want
i
just
hope
they
can
prop
him
up
long
enough
to
take
the
picture
cordelia
can
i
talk
to
you
oh
great
why
is
she
always
try
uff
harmony
oh
for
heaven
sakes
clear
back
everyone
give
her
some
air
you
school
nurse
now
ow
oh
my
ankle
i
think
it's
broken
what
happened
hey
who's
the
principal
here
what
happened
she
fell
she
she
we
were
standing
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
she
just
fell
all
by
herself
no
i
was
pushed
ow
don't
sue
is
anybody
here
hey
who's
here
okay
i
know
someone's
here
look
i'm
not
gonna
hurt
you
i
just
wanna
talk
to
you
giles
have
you
ever
touched
a
ghost
uh
no
from
what
i've
heard
uh
having
a
a
ghost
pass
through
you
is
a
singular
experience
it's
a
it's
a
rather
uh
cold
amorphous
feeling
it
makes
your
hair
stand
on
end
you
see
that's
my
problem
i
touched
the
thing
but
it
didn't
go
through
me
it
bumped
into
me
and
it
wasn't
cold
so
we're
talking
about
what
an
invisible
person
a
girl
she
laughed
a
girl
on
campus
with
the
ability
to
become
invisible
that
is
so
cool
cool
well
yeah
i
would
give
anything
to
be
able
to
turn
invisible
well
i
wouldn't
use
my
powers
to
beat
people
up
but
i'd
use
my
powers
to
protect
the
girls'
locker
room
it
must
be
a
fairly
heady
experience
having
that
ability
how'd
she
get
it
is
she
a
witch
'cause
we
can
fight
a
witch
hmm
greek
myths
speak
of
cloaks
of
invisibility
but
they're
usually
for
the
gods
research
boy
comes
through
with
the
knowledge
this
girl's
sorta
petty
for
a
god
she's
got
a
grudge
but
why
harmony
harmony
and
mitch
the
common
denominator
is
cordelia
so
what
now
first
thing
tomorrow
why
don't
you
pull
up
that
missing
kids
list
got
it
i'll
see
ya
then
bye
see
ya
oh
hey
do
you
wanna
come
to
our
place
tonight
for
dinner
mom's
making
her
famous
phone
call
to
the
chinese
place
xander
do
you
guys
even
have
a
stove
so
i'll
look
into
ways
that
you
can
decloak
an
invisible
someone
what
about
you
i
think
cordelia's
gonna
be
workin'
on
her
may
queen
dress
tonight
maybe
there'll
be
some
action
guess
i'm
gonna
start
the
hunt
how
exactly
do
you
propose
to
hunt
someone
you
can't
see
you
may
have
to
work
on
listening
to
people
very
funny
i
thought
so
should
i
wear
my
hair
up
do
you
think
i
should
wear
it
up
how
does
the
um
hem
go
is
it
is
it
long
enough
or
isn't
it
beautiful
who's
there
a
vampire
casts
no
reflection
don't
worry
i'm
not
here
to
eat
buffy
told
me
you
don't
feed
from
humans
anymore
not
for
a
long
while
is
that
why
you're
here
to
see
her
i
can't
it's
uh
it's
too
hard
for
me
to
be
around
her
a
vampire
in
love
with
a
slayer
it's
rather
poetic
in
a
maudlin
sort
of
way
what
can
i
uh
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
know
you've
been
researching
the
master
yes
the
vampire
king
i've
tried
to
learn
as
much
as
i
can
about
him
for
the
day
that
buffy
must
face
him
something's
already
in
motion
something
big
but
i
don't
know
what
you've
read
all
the
slayer
lore
there
is
right
ii've
studied
all
the
extant
volumes
of
course
but
the
uh
most
salient
books
of
slayer
prophecy
have
been
lost
the
tiberius
manifesto
the
pergamum
codex
the
codex
it's
reputed
to
have
contained
the
most
complete
prophecies
about
the
slayer's
role
in
the
end
years
unfortunately
the
book
was
lost
in
the
15th
century
not
lost
misplaced
i
can
get
it
that
would
be
most
helpful
uh
mmy
own
volumes
have
been
rather
useless
of
late
legends
of
vishnu
there's
an
invisible
girl
terrorizing
the
school
that's
not
really
my
area
of
expertise
nor
mine
i'm
afraid
uh
it's
fascinating
though
by
all
accounts
it's
a
a
a
wonderful
power
to
possess
oh
i
don't
know
looking
in
the
mirror
every
day
and
seeing
nothing
there
it's
an
overrated
pleasure
god
i
am
never
sitting
through
another
one
of
those
alumni
lectures
again
two
hours
of
'my
trek
through
nepal'
hello
there
is
nobody
caring
and
did
you
guys
see
his
toupee
i
mean
it
looks
like
a
cabbage
and
those
slides
'that's
a
mountain
that's
a
mountain
too
now
look
at
some
mountains'
harmony
i
swear
he
had
three
slides
and
just
used
them
over
and
over
i
know
but
did
you
guys
see
his
toupee
i
mean
it
was
like
the
worst
we're
talking
okay
oh
and
did
you
guys
check
out
that
extreme
toupee
yeah
that's
realistic
it
looked
like
a
cabbage
the
winner
is
cordelia
chase
let's
bring
up
our
new
may
queen
thank
you
for
making
the
right
choice
and
for
showing
me
how
much
you
all
love
me
being
this
popular
is
not
just
my
right
but
my
responsibility
and
i
want
you
to
know
i
take
it
very
seriously
it
all
began
when
so
giles
said
you'd
be
here
why
are
you
being
here
last
night
was
a
bust
but
i
still
think
cordy's
the
key
this
is
the
dead
and
missing
list
i
pulled
up
their
classes
activities
medical
records
good
work
has
cordelia
hired
a
bodyguard
or
something
hey
you
guys
check
out
this
one
it's
the
most
recent
one
marcie
ross
disappeared
like
six
months
ago
i
don't
know
her
me
neither
her
only
activity
was
band
she
played
the
flute
so
well
last
night
when
i
was
hunting
i
heard
this
flute
but
i
couldn't
figure
out
where
it
was
coming
from
and
it
was
in
the
band
room
that
i
lost
miss
invisible
yesterday
you
know
what
this
all
tracks
i'm
gonna
check
it
out
see
you
guys
later
okay
we'll
see
you
after
geometry
ask
not
what
your
school
can
do
for
you
ask
hey
what
am
i
wearing
to
the
spring
fling
marcie
ross
so
it
is
you
cordelia
could
you
possibly
be
on
time
who's
there
ms
miller
oh
my
god
ms
miller
oh
my
god
are
you
okay
ms
miller
what
happened
attacked
didn't
see
a
nest
it
looked
like
she'd
been
there
for
months
it's
where
i
found
this
oh
my
god
'have
a
nice
summer
have
a
nice
summer'
this
girl
had
no
friends
at
all
uh
once
again
i
teeter
at
the
precipice
of
the
generation
gap
'have
a
nice
summer'
is
what
you
write
when
you
have
nothing
to
say
it's
the
kiss
of
death
you
guys
didn't
know
marcie
ross
never
met
her
why
'cause
you
both
wrote
it
too
'have
a
nice'
yeesh
where
am
i
oh
'have
a
great
summer'
see
i
cared
you
guys
don't
remember
her
no
i
probably
didn't
see
her
except
to
sign
the
book
i
mean
this
is
a
big
school
xander
we
each
had
four
classes
with
her
last
year
so
no
one
noticed
her
and
now
she's
invisible
what
she
turned
invisible
because
no
one
noticed
her
of
course
i've
been
investigating
the
mystical
causes
of
invisibility
when
i
i
should
have
looked
at
the
quantum
mechanical
physics
i
think
i
speak
for
everyone
here
when
i
say
huh
it's
a
rudimentary
concept
that
that
reality
is
shaped
even
even
created
by
our
perception
and
with
the
hellmouth
below
us
sending
out
mystical
energy
people
perceived
marcie
as
as
as
invisible
and
and
and
and
she
became
so
so
who
knows
the
answer
to
this
one
think
about
it
cordelia
well
just
because
the
story's
about
him
doesn't
necessarily
mean
he's
the
hero
right
exactly
so
what
do
we
call
him
willow
well
the
protagonist
xander
why
can't
he
be
both
i
mean
he
did
do
some
things
that
are
pretty
heroic
absolutely
who
doesn't
agree
with
that
okay
and
how
about
you
this
isn't
this
great
power
that
she
can
control
it's
something
that
was
done
to
her
that
we
did
to
her
no
wonder
she's
miffed
what
does
she
want
just
what
we
thought
cordelia
what
i
knew
you'd
be
here
buffy
i
uh
i
i
know
we've
had
our
differences
with
you
being
so
weird
and
all
and
hanging
out
with
these
total
losers
ooo
well
anyway
despite
all
of
that
i
know
that
you
share
this
feeling
that
we
have
for
each
other
deep
down
nausea
somebody
is
after
me
they
just
tried
to
kill
ms
miller
uh
she
was
helping
me
with
my
homework
and
mitch
and
harmony
this
is
all
about
me
me
me
me
wow
for
once
she's
right
so
you've
come
to
me
for
help
because
you're
always
around
when
all
this
weird
stuff
is
happening
and
i
know
you're
very
strong
and
you've
got
all
those
weapons
i
was
kind
of
hoping
you
were
in
a
gang
please
i
don't
have
anyone
else
to
turn
to
please
sit
down
okay
thanks
you
know
i
i
don't
recall
ever
seeing
you
here
before
oh
no
i
have
a
life
okay
cordelia
your
attacker
is
an
invisible
girl
who
is
really
really
angry
at
you
which
i
can't
imagine
personally
but
it
takes
all
kinds
y'know
well
i
don't
care
what
it
is
just
get
rid
of
it
well
it's
not
that
simple
it's
a
person
it's
it's
this
person
now
do
you
have
any
idea
why
she'd
be
so
oh
god
is
she
really
wearing
laura
ashley
so
homicidal
i
have
no
idea
i've
never
seen
this
girl
before
in
my
life
i
won
'cause
you
didn't
see
me
coming
cordelia
you
don't
remember
me
i
remember
you
all
your
idiot
slut
friends
i
hate
them
they
take
your
life
and
they
suck
it
out
of
you
but
then
they
didn't
see
me
coming
they
gotta
learn
they
gotta
learn
according
to
what
you
told
us
about
the
attack
on
ms
miller
we
now
have
two
messages
from
marcie
'look'
and
'listen'
messages
we
don't
understand
i
don't
think
we're
supposed
to
yet
marcie's
not
quite
ready
but
from
what
she
did
to
cordelia's
picture
i
would
say
that
she's
wigged
on
the
whole
may
queen
thing
maybe
she's
gonna
do
something
about
it
stop
the
coronation
tonight
maybe
keep
you
guys
away
from
the
bronze
nothing
is
keeping
me
from
the
bronze
tonight
uh
can
we
just
revel
in
your
fabulous
lack
of
priorities
if
i'm
not
crowned
tonight
then
then
marcie's
won
and
that
would
be
bad
she's
evil
okay
way
eviler
than
me
cordelia
has
a
point
buffy's
with
me
on
this
anyway
continuing
the
normal
may
queen
activities
may
be
the
best
way
to
draw
marcie
out
we
can
use
cordelia
as
bait
great
bait
willow
xander
you'll
help
me
begin
our
research
anew
unless
we
find
a
way
to
cure
marcie's
invisibility
then
buffy
will
be
a
sitting
duck
c'mon
well
i
have
to
try
on
my
dress
and
am
i
really
bait
so
how
much
the
creepy
is
it
that
this
marcie's
been
at
this
for
months
spying
on
us
learning
our
most
guarded
secrets
so
are
you
saying
she's
invisible
because
she's
so
unpopular
that
about
sums
it
up
bummer
for
her
it's
awful
to
feel
that
lonely
hmm
so
you've
read
something
about
the
feeling
hey
you
think
i'm
never
lonely
because
i'm
so
cute
and
popular
i
can
be
surrounded
by
people
and
be
completely
alone
it's
not
like
any
of
them
really
know
me
i
don't
even
know
if
they
like
me
half
the
time
people
just
want
to
be
in
a
popular
zone
sometimes
when
i
talk
everyone's
so
busy
agreeing
with
me
they
don't
hear
a
word
i
say
well
if
you
feel
so
alone
then
why
do
you
work
so
hard
at
being
popular
well
it
beats
being
alone
all
by
yourself
shhh
listen
come
on
we
could
talk
to
her
perhaps
reason
with
her
or
possibly
grab
her
there
are
three
of
us
let's
go
if
you
ever
tell
to
anyone
that
i
changed
in
a
mop
closet
your
secret
dies
with
me
looks
okay
but
hurry
okay
over
here
marcie
we
know
what
happened
to
you
please
can
we
talk
to
you
we're
sorry
we
ignored
you
can
you
say
'gulp'
what's
that
sound
you
know
what
you
were
saying
before
i
understand
somehow
it
doesn't
seem
to
matter
how
popular
you
are
when
you
were
popular
in
what
alternate
universe
in
la
ththe
point
is
i
did
sort
of
feel
like
something
was
missing
is
that
when
you
became
weird
and
got
kicked
out
okay
can
we
have
the
heartfelt
talk
with
a
little
less
talk
from
you
cordelia
cordelia
cordelia
buffy
it's
gas
she's
snuffed
out
the
pilot
light
the
gas
is
on
full
i
can't
find
the
shutoff
valve
is
this
it
okay

give
us
a
few
minutes
but
we
b
if

don't
get
out
of
this
room
soon
why
is
marcie
doing
this
the
loneliness
the
constant
exile
she's
she
has
gone
mad

you're
not
the
student
you're
the
lesson
what
did
you
do
to
my
face
your
face
that's
what
this
is
all
about
isn't
it
your
beautiful
face
that's
what
makes
you
shine
just
a
little
bit
brighter
than
the
rest
of
us
we
all
want
what
you
have
to
be
noticed

to
be

gonna
dream
about
you
and
every
one
of
your
your

be
with
all
your
friends

feel
so
alone
'cause
they
don't
really
know
you
you're
just
a
typical
selfinvolved
spoiled
little
brat
and
you
think
you
can
charm
your
way
