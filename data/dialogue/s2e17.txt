think
i
slip
the
net
but
i
cut
myself
free
cut
to
the
crowd
below
buffy
and
xander
are
dancing
together
but
not
close
and
exchange
a
few
words
as
they
move
around
behind
them
cordelia
and
willow
are
sitting
at
a
table
and
chatting
i'm
not
losing
yet
so
don't
forget
me
i'll
say
it
replay
it
passion
and
try
tomorrow
angelus
it
lies
in
all
of
us
i'll
say
it
replay
it
sleeping
and
live
with
sorrow
angelus
waiting
and
though
unwanted
you'd
think
i'd
learn
by
now
angelus
unbidden
it
will
stir
there's
never
an
easy
way
he
begins
to
move
around
the
room
all
the
while
keeping
his
stare
on
buffy
open
its
jaws
and
howl
i'll
get
through
somehow
i'm
on
my
knees
to
pray
cut
outside
to
the
alley
willow
and
buffy
come
walking
out
of
the
bronze
buffy
has
her
arm
hooked
into
willow's
cordelia
and
xander
are
behind
them
with
their
arms
around
each
other
you'd
think
i'd
learn
by
now
there's
never
an
easy
way
they
walk
past
a
couple
apparently
engaged
in
a
kiss
the
camera
stops
on
the
couple
i'll
get
through
somehow
it
speaks
to
us
guides
us
passion
rules
us
all
and
we
obey
what
other
choice
do
we
have
he
was
in
my
room
who
angel
he
was
in
my
room
last
night
are
you
sure
positive
when
i
woke
up
i
found
a
picture
he'd
left
me
on
my
pillow
a
visit
from
the
pointedtooth
fairy
wait
i
thought
vampires
couldn't
come
in
unless
you
invited
them
in
yes
but
uh
once
you've
invited
them
in
thereafter
they're
they're
always
welcome
y'know
i
think
there
may
be
a
valuable
lesson
for
you
gals
here
about
inviting
strange
men
into
your
bedrooms
oh
god
i
invited
him
in
my
car
once
that
means
he
can
come
into
my
car
whenever
he
wants
yep
you're
doomed
to
havin'
to
give
him
and
his
vamp
pals
a
lift
whenever
they
feel
like
it
and
those
guys
never
chip
in
for
gas
giles
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
spell
to
reverse
the
invitation
right
like
a
barrier
a
no
shoes
no
pulse
no
service
kind
of
thing
yeah
that
works
for
a
car
too
yes
well
iii
could
check
on
my
hello
excuse
me
but
have
you
ever
heard
of
knocking
we're
supposed
to
get
some
books
on
stalin
does
this
look
like
a
barnes
noble
this
is
a
school
library
xander
since
when
uh
yyes
yes
uh
third
row
historical
biographies
thanks
what
oh
hey
did
you
say
that
was
the
hello
so
angel
has
decided
to
step
up
his
harassment
of
you
by
sneaking
in
her
room
and
leaving
stuff
at
night
why
doesn't
he
just
slit
her
throat
or
strangle
her
while
she's
sleeping
or
cut
her
heart
out
what
i'm
trying
to
help
yes
uh
uh
look
it'sit's
classic
battle
strategy
to
throw
one's
opponent
off
his
game
hehehe's
just
trying
to
provoke
you
uh
to
taunt
you
to
to
goad
you
into
uh
some
mishap
of
some
sort
the
nahnahnahnahnahnah
approach
to
battle
yes
xander
once
more
you've
managed
to
boil
a
complex
thought
down
to
its
simplest
possible
form
giles
angel
once
told
me
that
when
he
was
obsessed
with
drusilla
the
first
thing
hhe
did
was
to
kill
her
family
your
mom
i
know
i'm
gonna
have
to
tell
her
something
the
truth
no
youyouyouyou
can't
do
that
yeah
the
more
people
who
know
the
secret
the
more
it
cheapens
it
for
the
rest
of
us
but
i've
gotta
tell
her
something
i've
gotta
do
something
giles
angel
has
an
allaccess
pass
to
my
house
and
i'm
not
always
there
when
my
mother
is
i
can't
protect
her
i
told
you
i
will
find
aa
spell
what
about
until
you
find
a
spell
until
then
you
and
your
mother
are
welcome
to
ride
around
with
me
in
my
car
buffy
ii
understand
your
concern
but
it's
imperative
that
you
keep
a
level
head
through
all
this
that's
easy
for
you
to
say
you
don't
have
angel
lurking
in
your
bedroom
at
night
i
know
how
hard
this
is
for
you
all
right
i
don't
but
as
the
slayer
you
don't
have
the
luxury
of
being
a
slave
to
your
your
passions
you
mustn't
let
angel
get
to
you
no
matter
how
provocative
his
behavior
may
become
so
what
you're
basically
saying
is
'just
ignore
him
and
maybe
he'll
go
away'
yes
precisely
hey
how
come
buffy
doesn't
get
a
snotty
'once
again
you
boil
it
down
to
the
simplest
form'
thing
watcher's
pet
don't
forget
i
need
your
sample
spreadsheets
by
the
end
of
the
week
oh
and
i
want
both
a
paper
printout
and
a
copy
on
disk
thank
you
willow
yes
um
i
might
be
a
little
late
tomorrow

you
think
you
could
cover
my
class
till
i
show
really
me
teach
the
class
sure
cool
oh
wait
wwhat
if
they
don't
recognize
my
authority
what
if
they
try
to
convince
me
that
you
always
let
them
leave
class
early
what
if
there's
a
fire
drill
what
if
there's
a
fire
willow
you're
gonna
be
fine
and
i'll
try
not
to
be
too
late
okay
okay
good
earlier
is
good
will
i
have
the
power
to
assign
detention
or
make
'em
run
laps
hey
will
hi
buffy
rupert
willow
i
thought
i
might
take
in
a
class
figured
i
could
use
someone
who
knows
where
they
are
sorry
i
have
to
talk
to
her
she's
a
teacher
and
teachers
are
to
be
respected
even
if
they're
only
filling
in
until
the
real
teacher
shows
up
because
otherwise
chaos
could
ensue
how
have
you
been
uh
not
so
good
actually
uh
since
angel
lost
his
soul
he's
regained
his
sense
of
whimsy
well
that
sounds
bad
he's
been
in
buffy's
bedroom
iii
need
to
drum
up
a
spell
to
uh
keep
him
out
of
the
house
this
might
help
i've
been
doing
a
little
reading
since
angel
changed
i
don't
think
you
have
that
one
thank
you
so
how's
buffy
doing
how
do
you
think
i
know
you
feel
betrayed
yes
well
that's
one
of
the
unpleasant
side
effects
of
betrayal
rupert
i
was
raised
by
the
people
that
angel
hurt
the
most
my
duty
to
them
was
the
first
thing
i
was
ever
taught
i
didn't
come
here
to
hurt
anyone
aand
i
lied
to
you
because
i
thought
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
i
i
didn't
know
what
would
happen
i
didn't
know
i
was
gonna
fall
in
love
with
you
oh
god
is
it
too
late
to
take
that
back
do
you
want
to
i
just
wanna
be
right
with
you
i
don't
expect
more
i
just
want
so
badly
to
make
all
this
up
to
you
i
understand
but
i'm
not
the
one
you
need
to
make
it
up
to
thank
you
for
the
book
okay
what's
wrong
it's
nothing
come
on
you
can
tell
me
anything
i've
read
all
the
parenting
books
you
cannot
surprise
me
do
you
remember
that
guy
angel
angel
the
um
the
college
boy
who
was
tutoring
you
in
history
right
uh
he
ii
oh
god
um
we're
sort
of
dating
were
dating
um
going
through
a
serious
offagain
phase
right
now
don't
tell
me
he's
changed
he's
not
the
same
guy
you
fell
for
in
a
nutshell
aanyway
um
since
he
changed
he's
been
kinda
following
me
around
he's
having
trouble
letting
go
buffy
has
he
done
anything
no
no
it's
not
like
that
he's
just
been
hanging
around
a
lot
just
sending
me
notes
that
kind
of
thing
i
just
don't
wanna
see
him
right
now
i
mean
if
he
shows
up
i'll
talk
to
him
just
don't
invite
him
in
i
agree
with
giles
you
need
to
just
try
and
not
let
him
get
to
you
angel's
only
doing
this
to
try
to
get
you
to
do
something
stupid
i
swear
men
can
be
such
jerks
sometimes
dead
or
alive
i
just
hope
giles
can
find
a
keepout
spell
soon
i
know
i'll
sleep
easier
when
i
can
sleep
easier
i'm
sure
he
will
he's
like
bookman
and
what
willow
willow
thanks
for
having
me
over
buffy
especially
on
a
school
night
and
all
no
problem
hey
sorry
about
your
fish
oh
it's
okay
we
hadn't
really
had
time
to
bond
yet
although
for
the
first
time
i'm
glad
my
parents
didn't
let
me
have
a
puppy
it's
so
weird
every
time
something
like
this
happens
my
first
instinct
is
still
to
run
to
angel
i
can't
believe
it's
the
same
person
he's
completely
different
from
the
guy
that
i
knew
well
sort
of
except
except
what
you're
still
the
only
thing
he
thinks
about
i
brought
something
for
you
poor
thing
she's
an
orphan
her
owner
died
without
a
fight
do
you
like
her
hmm
i
won't
have
you
feeding
me
like
a
child
dru
why
not
she
already
bathes
you
carries
you
around
and
changes
you
like
a
child
why
angel
where
have
you
been
the
sun
is
almost
up
and
it
can
be
so
hurtful
we
were
worried

we
weren't
you
must
forgive
spike
he's
just
a
bit
testy
tonight
well
maybe
next
time
i'll
bring
you
with
me
spike
might
be
handy
to
have
you
around
if
i
ever
need
a
really
good
parking
space
have
you
forgotten
that
you're
a
bloody
guest
in
my
bloody
home
and
as
a
guest
if
there's
anything
i
can
do
for
you
any
responsibility
i
can
assume
while
you're
spinning
your
wheels
anything
i'm
not
already
doing
that
is
that's
enough
aww

two
boys
fightin'
over

a
girl
feel
dru

is
it
pet

worries
welcome
how
may
i
serve
you
today

love
potion

voodoo
doll

that
unfaithful
i
need
an
orb
of
thesulah

lot
of
tourists
shopping

mystical
revenge
of
past
lovers

couple
as
new
age
paperweights
last
year
yeah
i
just
love
those
newagers
boy
they
helped
to
send
my
youngest
to

by
the
way
you
do
know
that
the
transliteration
annals
for
the
ritual
of
the
undead
were
lost
without
the
annals
the
surviving
text
is
gibberish
and
without
a
translated
text
the
orbs
of
thesulah
are
pretty
much
useless
yeah
i
know
well
i
only
mention
it
because
i
have
a
strict
policy
of
no
refunds
it's
okay
i'm
working
on
a
computer
program
to
translate
the
rumanian
liturgy
to
english
based
on
a
random
sampling
of
the
text
yecchh
i
don't
like
computers
they
give
me
the
willies
well
thank
you
you're
welcome
by
the
way

any
of
my
business

text

a
friend
of
mine

gonna
give
him

of
a
'pajama

the
presence
of
mind

locate
a
camera

capture
the
moment
i
have
to
go
i
have
a
class
to
teach
in
about
five
minutes

hours
of
lesson
planning
yesterday
down
the
drain

that
shoddy
gypsy
craftsmanship

never
cease
to
be
amazed

much
the
world

and
a
half

apartment
tonight

all
right

it
went
fine
until
angel
showed
up
and
told
buffy's
mom
that
he
and
buffy
had
well
you
know
that
they
had
you
know
you
do
know
right
oh
yes
yes
sorry
oh
good
'cause
i
just
realized
that
being
a
librarian
and
all
you
maybe
didn't
know
oh
thank
you
i
got
it
you
would
have
been
proud
of
her
though
she
totally
kept
her
cool
okay
well
i'll
tell
buffy
you
stopped
by
would
you
um
perhaps
i
should
intervene
on
on
buffy's
behalf
wwwith
her
mother
um
maybe
say
something
sure
like
what
would
you
say
w
uh
you
will
tell
buffy
i
dropped
by
you
bet
that
stuff
with
the
latins
and
the
herbs
uh
he's
just
real
superstitious
oh
we
just
thought
if
was
he
the
first
no
wait
i
don't
wanna
know
i
don't
think
i
want
to
yeah
he
was
the
first
i
mean
the
only
he's
older
than
you
i
know
too
old
buffy
and
he's
obviously
not
very
stable
i
really
wish
i
just
thought
you
would
show
more
judgment
he
wasn't
like
this
before
are
you
in
love
with
him
i
was
were
you
careful
mom
this
is
no
time
don't
'mom'
me
buffy
you
don't
get
to
get
out
of
this
you
had
sex
with
a
boy
you
didn't
even
see
fit
to
tell
me
you
were
dating
i
made
a
mistake
yeah
well
don't
just
say
that
to
shut
me
up
because
i
think
you
really
did
i
know
that
ii
can't
tell
you
everything
how
about
anything
buffy
you
can
shut
me
out
of
your
life
i
am
pretty
much
used
to
that
but
don't
expect
me
to
ever
stop
caring
about
you
because
it's
never
gonna
happen
i
love
you
more
than
anything
in
the
world
that
would
be
your
cue
to
uh
roll
your
eyes
and
tell
me
i'm
grossing
you
out
you're
not
oh
well
i
guess
that
was
the
talk
so
how'd
it
go
i
don't
know
it
was
my
first
hello
jenny
it's
me
mr
giles
i
need
to
ask
you
to
come
with
us
just
to
answer
a
few
questions
of
course
yes
procedure
i
need
to
make
a
phone
call
if
that's
all
right
yes
passion
is
the
source
of
our
finest
moments
the
joy
of
love
the
clarity
of
hatred
and
the
ecstasy
of
grief
hello
giles
hey
we
did
the
the
thing
it
worked
what
giles
what
no
no
noooo
where's
giles
no
luck
by
the
time
we
got
to
the
station
the
cops
said
he'd
already
left
i
guess
they
just
wanted
to
ask
him
some
questions
cordelia
will
you
drive
us
to
giles'
house
of
course
but
don't
you
think
he
wants
to
be
left
alone
i'm
not
worrying
about
what
he
wants
i'm
worried
about
what
he's
gonna
do
hello
giles
i
guess
giles
had
a
big
night
planned
tonight
giles
didn't
set
this
up
angel
did
this
is
the
wrapping
for
the
gift
oh
man
poor
giles
look
all
his
weapons
are
gone
but
i
thought
he
kept
his
weapons
at
the
library
no
those
are
his
uh
everyday
weapons
these
were
his
good
weapons
the
ones
he
uh
breaks
out
when
company
comes
to
visit
so
he's
not
here
well
then
where
is
he
he'll
go
to
wherever
angel
is
that
means
the
factory
right
so
giles
is
gonna
try
to
kill
angel
then
well
it's
about
time
somebody
did
xander
i'm
sorry
but
let's
not
forget
that
i
hated
angel
long
before
you
guys
jumped
on
the
bandwagon
so
i
think
i
deserve
a
little
something
for
not
saying
'i
told
you
so'
long
before
now
and
if
giles
wants
to
go
after
the
uh
fiend
that
murdered
his
girlfriend
i
say
'faster
pussycat
kill
kill'
you're
right
thank
you
there's
only
one
thing
wrong
with
giles'
little
revenge
scenario
and
what's
that
it's
gonna
get
him
killed
are
you
insane
we're
supposed
to
kill
the
bitch
not
leave
gag
gifts
in
the
friends'
beds
but
spike
the
bad
teacher
was
going
to
restore
angel's
soul
what
if
she
did
if
you
ask
me
i
find
myself
preferring
the
old
buffywhipped
angelus
this
new
improved
one
is
not
playing
with
a
full
sack
i
love
a
good
slaughter
as
much
as
the
next
bloke
but
his
little
pranks
will
only
leave
us
with
one
incredibly
brassedoff
slayer
don't
worry
roller
boy
i've
got
everything
under
control
jeez
whatever
happened
to
wooden
stakes
uhuh
no
fair
going
into
the
ring
unless
he
tags
you
first
all
right
you've
had
your
fun
but
you
know
what
it's
time
for
now
my
fun
are
you
gonna
let
your
old
man
just
burn
why
did
you
come
here
this
wasn't
your
fight
are
you
trying
to
get
yourself
killed
you
can't
leave
me
i
can't
do
this
alone
it
hurts
sometimes
more
than
we
can
bear
if
we
could
live
without
passion
maybe
we'd
know
some
kind
of
peace
but
we
would
be
hollow
empty
rooms
shuttered
and
dank
without
passion
we'd
be
truly
dead
in
my
years
as
watcher
i've
buried
too
many
people
but
jenny
was
the
first
i've
loved
i'm
sorry
i'm
sorry
i
couldn't
kill
him
for
you
for
her
when
i
had
the
chance
i
wasn't
ready
but
i
think
i
finally
am
hi
principal
snyder
asked
me
to
fill
in
for
ms

until

new
computer
