ok
ok
i'm
coming
i'm
up
it's
430
in
the
morning
sweet
mamalooshin
who
is
it
it's
me
buffy
where's
spike
spike
spike
xander
is
he
here
no
he's
out
at
least
he
was
when
i
got
home
any
idea
where
he
went
i
don't
know
creature
of
the
night
buff
he's
probably
out
creaturing
why
what
happened
is
he
in
trouble
i
hope
not
nora
nora
buffy
she's
not
here
dawn
oh
my
god
what're
you—
dawn
what
happened
here
what—
you're
cut
i'm
all
right
let
me
see
make
sure
i
saw
mom
what
she
was
here
willow
i
saw
her
she
was
here
and
she
spoke
to
me
oh
sweetie
no
she
was
right
here
and—and
then
she
wasn't
she—
it
wasn't
her
what
at
least
i
don't
think
ii
saw
something
too
and
it
looked
like
someone
else
but
it
wasn't
i
don't
understand
it's
the
big
bad
dawn
the
one
we
knew
was
coming
but
that's
what
she
said
mom
she
said
that
things
were
coming
that
things
were
on
their
way
and
that
she
loves
us
so
it
had
to
be
her
right
i
mean
her
warning
was
true
i
don't
know
i
just
don't
think
we
can
trust
anything
right
now
so
maybe
the
evil
thing
messing
with
you
was
here
too
only
maybe
it
was
the
thing
trying
to
keep
mom
away
'cause
she
was
trying
to
protect
me
maybe
why
would
a
vampire
lie
about
who
sired
him
what's
that
some
kind
of
status
symbol
for
the
undead
my
sire
can
beat
up
your
sire
i'm
not
saying
i
don't
believe
him
you
just
don't
want
to
ok
let's
look
at
this
objectively
figure
it
out
in
a
cold
impersonal
csilike
manner
'cause
we're
a
couple
of
carpet
fibers
away
from
a
case
spike
can't
be
the
one
doing
this
he
couldn't
if
he
wanted
to
why
not
well
for
one
thing
pain
chip
remember
he
can't
hurt
anyone
didn't
stop
him
from
hurting
you
hey
objective
here
maybe
the
chip's
not
working
anymore
oh
it's
working
i've
seen
it
is
it
or
is
that
what
spike
wants
you
to
think
you
think
it's
an
act
i
don't
really
know
and
neither
do
you
no
mmmmm
there's
something
ii
can
feel
it
he's
different
he's
changed
and
if
it
is
an
act
then
the
oscar
goes
to
well
this
can't
be
good
you
here
at
this
hour
there
trouble
no
no
trouble
i
was
just—
uh
we
were
just—
right
none
of
my
business
no
worries
spike
i—
how
was
your
night
's
all
right
and
yours
did
you
uh
bag
any
baddies
one
vampire
uh
someone
i
used
to
know
actually
a
little
holden
holden
webster
you
knew
him
huh
that
must've
been
a
picnic
yeah
well
i'm
gonna
turn
in
before
i
drop
g'night
you
see
that
you
see
how
he
reacted
when
you
mentioned
webs
cool
as
cool
whip
what's
up
with
that
the
sun's
coming
up
i
need
to
get
home
and
check
on
dawn
we
need
to
keep
an
eye
on
spike
whoa
whoa
whoa
when
you
say
we
you
mean
me
and
me's
gotta
go
to
work
i
got
a
big
client
meeting
in
a
couple
of
hours
xander
this
is
serious
we
cannot
let
him
leave
this
house
until
we
know
if
he's
killing
again
we
need
to
find
someone
that
can
watch
him
uhuh
forget
it
harris
come
on
anya
you
said
you'd
do
it
on
the
phone
yeah
but
that—
that
was
before
you
told
me
spike's
killing
again
and
now
you
want
me
to
be
alone
with
him
you
didn't
mind
being
alone
with
him
before
what
was
that
nothing
look
we
don't
actually
know
that
he's
killed
anyone
you
know
lately
might
all
just
be
a
mistake
yeah
but
you
don't
think
so
ok
have
you
searched
his
room
for
clues
trophies
from
victims
killers
like
to
keep
trophies
sometimes
scalps
necklaces
made
from
human
teeth
you
know
it
didn't
occur
to
me
to
look
but
thanks
for
the
tip
ok
so
you'll
be
safe
in
here
plenty
of
sunlight
for
you
to
hide
in
what
that's
it
you're
not
at
least
gonna
like
leave
me
a
crossbow
or
a
flame
thrower
something
to
protect
myself
we
don't
want
him
to
know
we
suspect
anything
besides
if
he
tries
to
leave
i
don't
want
you
confronting
him
call
buffy
and
just
let
her
know
that
he's
on
the
move
you're
gonna
be
fine
better
be
because
if
i
get
vamped
i'm
gonna
bite
your
ass
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
what
was
that
dawn
dawn
buffy
it's
ok
she's
ok
not
hurt
she's
just
exhausted
finally
fell
off
to
sleep
what
the
hell
happened
downstairs
looks
like—
hell
happened
yeah
this
big
evil
that's
been
promising
to
devour
us—well
i
think
it's
started
chomping
oh
god
and
it
started
with
dawn
both
of
us
buffy
this
thing
knows
us
it
made
us
think
that
we
were
talking
to
people
we
knew
mine
said
it
came
with
a
message
from
tara
but
dawn
actually
saw
your
mother
this
thing—it
had
me
for
a
while—i
mean
before
it
started
letting
loose
with
the
pulsepounding
terror
but
before
that
the
lies
were
very
convincing
it
just
seems
real
lies
i
mean
maybe—maybe
to
confuse
us
to
mess
us
up
or
maybe
just
to
be
cool
vampire
i
killed
last
night
told
me
spike
sired
him—two
nights
ago
well
that's
impossible
right
so
maybe
it
was
another
one
a
fakeout
you
got
one
too
it
wasn't
a
real
vamp
it
dusted
real
enough
buffy
do
you
think
spike
is—
i
can't
i
hope
not
but
if
i'm
wrong
and
he
is
then
i
have
to
see
it
for
myself
i
have
to
be
there
to
stop
it
anya
do
be
specific
and
tell
a
fellow
just
exactly
what
you're
doing
here
well
spike
i'm
here
obviously
forumsex
uh
beg
pardon
you
and
me
here
and
now
let's
go
let's
get
it
on
you
big
bad
boy
wait
wait
anya
just
a
minute
this
is
not
exactly—is
that
a
stake
yes
kinky
uh
well
yeah
but
what
do
you—
shh
no
questions
no
talking
i
can't
help
it
i
can't
stop
thinking
about
you
and
us
and
our
brief
but
unforgettable
time
together
i
mean
it's—why
else
would
i
be
here
i
mean
it's
not
like
i'm
snooping
around
looking
for
proof
that
you're
some
sort
of
wacked
out
serial
killer
i
don't
know
why
i
said
that
forget
i
said
that
it's
craziness

just
nerves

andand
horniness
oh
just
shut
up
william
and
take
me
take
me
now

hmm

not
that
i'm
not
tempted
obviously

things
were
different
you're
a
right
catch
i
got
it
no
problem
i
understand
you
think
i'm
fat
what
well
it's
either
that
or
the
haircut

do's
quite
fetching
oh

like
the
haircut

it
sure
as
a
friend
anya
you
know
you
were
a
lot
more
fun
when
you
didn't
have
a
soul
oh
come
on
now
i've
just
explained
to
you—
all
i'm
saying
is
soulless
spike
would
have
had
me
upside
down
and
half
way
to
happy
land
by
now
i
need
my
pants
didn't
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
luv
who's
hurt
i'm
fine
right
look
uh
i
got
things
to
do
don't
stick
around
on
my
account
it's
me
he's
leaving
so
um
what
kind
of
name
is
spike
what—are
you
gonna
make
me
guess
all
right
i'll
guess
you're
a
little
bit
bad
huh
am
i
right
are
you
a
bad
boy
'cause
i
don't
mind
you
know
i
was
getting
pretty
bored
waiting
over
there
in
that
line
i
hate
waiting
know
what
i
mean
you
know
you
want
it
you
know
i
want
you
to
um
is
everything—
there's
my
guy
now
doesn't
that
feel
better
how
could
you
use
a
poor
maiden
so
did
you
kill
her
what
the
girl
last
night
what
girl
what
are
you
talking
about
i
caught
the
first
act
i
missed
the
curtain
call
did
you
kill
her
did
you
turn
her
is
she
one
of
your
kind
now
diddid
you—are
you
following
me
answer
the
question
where
is
she
who
knows
i
talked
to
her
is
all
really
looked
like
more
than
talking
to
me
well
i
certainly
didn't
off
her
where
are
you
getting
this
you
know
i
can't
right
the
chip
no
not
the
chip
not
the
chip
dammit
you
honestly
think
i'd
go
to
the
end
of
the
underworld
and
back
to
get
my
soul
and
then—
buffy
i
can
barely
live
with
what
i
did
it
haunts
me
all
of
it
if
you
think
that
i
would
add
to
the
body
count
now
you
are
crazy
so
what—you
just
troll
the
promenade
looking
for
drunk
coeds
cause
you're
hungry
for
conversation
oh
is
that
what
this
is
right
what
you're
jealous
don't
play
games
not
now
yeah
you
saw
me
chatting
up
another
bird
giving
the
eye
to
somebody
else
touched
a
nerve
didn't
it
don't
flatter
yourself
it
burns
huh
but
you
can't
admit
it
so
you
trump
up
some
charge
about
me
being
back
on
the
juice
this
vampire
i
killed
told
me—
told
you
what
that
i
go
out
yeah
i
talk
to
people
women
talk
to
them
'cause
i
can't
talk
to
you
oh
spike
save
it
as
daft
a
notion
as
soulful
spike
the
killer
is
it
is
nothing
compared
to
the
idea
that
another
girl
could
mean
anything
to
me
this
chip—they
did
to
me
i
couldn't
help
it
but
the
soul
i
got
on
my
own—for
you
i
know
so
yeah
i
go
and
pass
the
time
with
someone
but
that's
all
it
is
is
time
'cause—god
help
me
buffy—it's
still
all
about
you
spike
this
vampire
told
me
you
sired
him
that
doesn't
mean—
he
said
you
killed
him
dumped
him
in
a
parking
lot
somewhere
and
you
believe
him
vampires
aren't—
i
did
follow
you
last
night
and
you
know
what
you
didn't
look
lonely
or
casual
to
me
you
looked
like
you
were
on
the
prowl
you
can't
know
that
so
then
tell
me
tell
me
what
happened
you
talked
to
her
then
what
we
talked
that's
all
i
remember
all
you
remember
i
don't
know
i
go
out
i
talk
to
people
or
i
don't
it's
boring
it
all
bleeds
together
well
if
you
seem
to
forget
that
much
then—
not
that
the
taste
of
human
blood
that
i'd
remember
you
were
camped
out
on
the
hell
mouth
talking
to
invisible
people
recently
how
can
you
be
sure
of—
no
you
are
wrong
you've
got
an
accusation
from
a
pile
of
dust
and
not
a
shred
of
proof
so
i'll
get
some
ok
guys
find
me
some
evidence
that
he
did
this
really
are
you
sure
that's
what
you
want
find
me
the
proof
that
he
didn't
you
only
think
spike
is
turning
people
'cause
that
vampire
told
you
so
right
but
that
night
we
were
all
told
things
that
weren't
true
maybe
what
what
maybe
well
just
because
those
weren't
the
spirits
of
you
know
our
people—just
because
it
was
some
evil
thing
doesn't
mean
what
they
said
can't
be
true
i
used
to
tell
the
truth
all
the
time
when
i
was
evil
look
we
can't
assume
anything
we
need
hard
facts
well
if
spike
is
biting
people
again
should
there
be
more
dead
people
with
neck
trauma
right
we
can
find
that
no
no
we
can't
find
that
but
that's
easy
that
computer's
a
moron
i
mean
no
there's
not
really
an
increase
in
neck
injuries
but
but
what
oh
missing
people
eight
maybe
oh
ten
of
them
no
bodies
they're
just
missing
mostly
young
lots
of
girls
so
it's
true
what
that
vampire
told
buffy
turned
out
to
be
true
maybe
but
it
still
doesn't
prove
that
it's
spike
right
now
he's
the
only
one
who
knows
for
sure
no
no
no
you're
not
going
out
i
have
to
go
buffy
was
very
clear
about
the
not
leaving
of
you
i
know
what
the
slayer
told
you
it's
not
true
now
let
me
go
and
i'll
find
a
way
to
prove
it
ok
i'm
gonna
list
the
reasons
that
won't
happen
one—
ow
this
is
how
it
goes
you'll
get
angry
at
yourself
and
think
you
can
think
of
something
else
and
i'll
hear
the
clanging
of
the
bells
'cause
i
can't
stop
you
baby
'cause
i
don't
have
a
bribery
in
place
no
bright
shiny
surface
to
my
face
so
i
won't
go
near
the
marketplace
with
what
i'm
selling
lately
'cause
this
is
how
it
goes
she
had
blonde
hair
a
nice
looking
girl
i
was
here
talking
with
her
the
other
night
i
was
looking
for
someone
who
might've
seen
her
no
sorry
this
is
how
it
goes
it's
all
about
shame
and
whatever
they
want
don't
tell
'em
your
name
he
hit
you
knocked
me
out
he's
been
gone
at
least
half
an
hour
any
idea
where
he's
headed
one
of
them
take
your
wallet
what's
that
the
way
you're
scanning
that
crowd—you
look
like
you're
out
for
blood
i'm
just
looking
for
a
certain
bird
i
met
here
the
other
night
hmm
was
it
me
sorry
luv
don't
think
so
not
even
if
i
ask
nice
or
are
you
the
type
that
has
to
be
convinced
friendly
warning
pet
i'm
the
type
best
left
alone
huh
i
get
it
you'd
rather
i
slip
into
something
more
comfortable
should
we
pick
off
the
crowd
onebyone
or
block
the
exits
and
ravish
the
place
get
away
from
me
what's
with
the
wallflower
act
you
didn't
seem
so
shy
when
you
were
biting
me

wanna
be
soul
mates
just
figured
you'd
wanna
have
some
fun

going
against
the
plan
but
we
can
make
it
work
down
here
you
won't
come
down
i
understand
it's
a
risky
proposition
there's
an
order
the
slayer's
not
in
order
but
it
can't
hurt
to
play
get
your
claws
in
the
mouse

know
you
are
not
here
all
right
what
do
you
want
to
show
me
i've
been
remembering
the
girl
i
walked
her
home
the
one
you
saw
and
the
one
before
that
and
i
think
i
killed
her
and

think

think
i
killed
the
lady
who
lived
here
and
there
might
be
others

god

think
i
buried
them
here

well
i
don't
know

i
i
don't
even
know
how
shouldn't
be
able—
early
one
morning
just
as
the
sun
was
rising
i
heard
the
fair
maid
sing
in
the
valley
down
below
oh
don't
deceive
me
oh
never
leave
me
how
could
you
use
a
poor
maid
so
what
what
is
it
spike
what
are
you
doing
oh
spike
listen
to
me
you
don't
want
to
do
this
and
it's
just
about
to
get
fun
oh
god

know
what
i
want
you
to
do
they're
waiting
for
you

her
taste

her
weak

gonna
kill
you

lose
mate
sorry
ma'am
but
it's
my
job
do
it
fast
ok
he
said
you'd
do
it
who
said
me
it
was
me
i
saw
it
i
was
here
the
whole
time
talking
and
singing
there
was
a
song
what
are
you
talking
about
i
don't
know
please
i
don't
remember
don't
make
me
remember
make
it
so
i
forget
again
i
did
what
you
wanted
there's
something
here
oh
god
no
please
i
need
that
i
can't
cry
the
soul
out
of
me
it
won't
come
i
killed
and
i
can
feel
'em
i
can
feel
every
one
of
them
there's
something
playing
with
us
all
of
us
what
is
it
why
is
it
doing
this
to
me
i
don't
know
will
you
help
me
can
you
help
me
i'll
help
you
and
you
believe
him
you
didn't
see
him
down
there
he
really
didn't
know
what
he'd
done
it
wasn't
in
his
control
oh
an
out
of
control
serial
killer
you're
right
that
is
a
great
houseguest
wait
is
he—is
he
staying
here
i
don't
know
but
i'm
not
letting
him
out
of
my
sight
that's
for
sure
buffy
he's
been
feeding
on
human
blood
that's
gotta
do
stuff
i'm
not
keeping
him
around
just
to
help
him
i
think
there
was
something
there
talking
to
him
making
him
do
things
something
like
what
was
talking
to
us
maybe
but
if
it
was
it's
been
screwing
with
spike
big
time
so
you
want
him
around
because
look
there's
something
evil
working
us
and
if
we
are
ever
gonna
have
a
chance
to
fight
it
we
need
to
learn
everything
we
can
about
it
this
thing
has
been
closer
to
spike
than
any
of
us
and
if
you
want
to
understand
it
i'm
gonna
have
to
get
close
to
spike
nah
it's
too
dangerous
i
don't
have
a
choice
whatever
this
thing
is
from
beneath
us
it's
bad
and
it's
only
getting
worse
oh
dear
god
robson
are
you
here
robson
you
too
dear
god
i
thought
you—
gather
them
it's
started
it's
all
right
i
understand
i'll
take
care
of
it—
