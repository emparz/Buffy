spike
spike
wants
me
how
obscene
is
that
well
it
is
very
strange
i
can't
imagine
what
he's
thinking
uh
not
not
that
you're
not
uh
attractive
i
feel
gross
you
know
like
like
dirty
that's
ridiculous
you
can't
be
responsible
for
what
spike
thinks
or
feels
well
aren't
i
responsible
i
mean
something
about
me
had
to
make
him
feel
that
right
something
that
made
him
say
'woof
that's
the
one
for
me'
she
resumes
punching
very
violently
and
finishes
by
kneeing
the
target
sharply
buffy
i
think
you
should
perhaps
calm
down
me
too
oh
puffy
xander
uh
i'm
sorry
i
got
guess
i
got
carried
away
are
you
okay
i'm
alive
i
can
tell
'cause
of
the
pain
do
you
wanna
sit
down
i'm
not
that
bendy
i
could
lean
i'll
get
some
ice
here
comfy
oh
yeah
this
leaning
this
is
the
stuff
that's
my
secret
to
attracting
men
you
know
it's
simple
really
you
slap
'em
around
a
bit
you
torture
'em
you
make
their
lives
a
living
hell
xander
buff
and
sure
the
nice
guys
they'll
run
away
but
every
now
and
then
you'll
meet
a
real
prince
of
a
guy
like
spike
who
gets
off
on
it
buffy

stand
me
up
the
problem
is
not
you
don't
do
this
to
yourself
please
it's
just
i
just
wanna
know
that
there's
gonna
be
another
good
one
one
that
i
won't
chase
away
there
will
be
promise
he's
out
there
he
could
come
along
any
minute
yeah
and
the
minute
after
that
i
can
terrify
him
with
my
alarming
strength
and
remarkable
selfinvolvement
what
i
don't
think
you're
like
that
maybe
i
could
change
you
know
i
could
i
could
work
harder
i
could
spend
less
time
slaying
i
could
laugh
at
his
jokes
i
mean
men
like
that
right
the
the
jokelaughingat
or
maybe
you
could
just
be
buffy
he'll
see
your
amazing
heart
and
he'll
fall
in
love
with
you
xander
that's
aw
this
is
the
day
you
choose
to
hug
me
buffy
mm
you
ever
think
maybe
the
reason
you
haven't
found
a
great
relationship
on
the
hellmouth
is
because
it's
a
hellmouth
seems
to
me
it's
a
pretty
terrible
place
to
try
to
build
anything
mm
thank
you
for
picking
me
up
i'm
very
grateful
for
the
ride
you
sure
you
want
to
get
out
here
i
mean
this
place
is
kinda

what
are
you
looking
for
in
sunnydale
anyway
true
love
i
might
like
it
more
than
the
others
can
you
spin
around
again
ooh
i'm
not
sure
once
more
now
could
you
go
the
other
way
you're
messing
with
me
we
just
wanted
to
see
how
many
times
we
could
get
you
to
do
it
was
that
five
or
four
and
a
half
so
is
anyone
gonna
talk
about
my
dress
i
like
it
you
sure
i
mean
it's
not
too
momish
oh
that
was
why
i
liked
it
you're
both
crazy
it's
not
momish
at
all
it's
sexy
it
screams
'randy
sex
kitten
buy
me
one
drink
and
i'll'
oh
wait
that's
not
really
good
either
oh
god
what
time
is
it
423
you
have
lots
of
time
until
seven
vast
acres
of
time
in
which
you
could
plant
crops
now
tell
me
about
this
brian
and
what
his
intentions
are
maybe
he's
a
gigolo
was
his
shirt
all
shiny
no
he
works
for
a
publishing
house
he's
a
nice
normal
guy
okay
i
think
i've
heard
of
those
he
came
to
the
gallery
my
first
day
back
when
i
was
you
know
kinda
shaky
starting
over
and
he
asked
a
question
about
these
antique
cameos
and
i
was
so
lost
because
carol
had
been
doing
the
ordering
while
i
was
sick
well
it
turned
out
that
he
didn't
know
anything
about
them
either
so
we
had
a
lot
to
talk
about
so
what's
the
plan
for
tonight
dinner
and
then
a
movie
or
maybe
it
was
a
movie
and
then
dinner
which
might
be
better
because
you
know
then
we
could
talk
about
the
movie
or
maybe
a
movie
isn't
a
good
idea
at
all
because
well
you
know
you
can't
talk
during
and
and
then
you
know
what's
the
point
of
any
of
it
oh
and
about
the
restaurant
do
you
think
that
it
should
be
one
with
candles
and
romantic
music
or
is
that
pushing
it
buffy
what
do
you
think
should
i
you
know
try
to
make
things
romantic
or
sorta
let
him
set
the
pace
oh
no
love
doctor
buffy
is
not
in
i
am
not
qualified
to
give
dating
advice
i've
had
exactly
two
boyfriends
and
they
both
left
really
left
left
town
left
honey
you
just
had
some
bad
luck
well
you're
going
to
that
spring
break
party
tonight
maybe
you'll
find
someone
there
mmhmm
or
maybe
brian
has
a
son
and
mom
and
i
can
go
on
some
unspeakably
awkward
double
dates
oh
god
brian
what
time
is
it
now
424
you
sure
the
dress
is
okay
hmm
spin
again
real
fast
this
time
willow's
good
at
all
that
computer
stuff
but
me
not
so
much
do
you
really
understand
all
that
oh
well
at
first
it
was
confusing
just
the
idea
of
computers
was
like
'whoa
i'm
eleven
hundred
years
old
i
had
trouble
adjusting
to
the
idea
of
lutherans'
tara
i
go
online
sometimes
but
everyone's
spelling
is
really
bad
and
it's
depressing
but
you
have
to
try
online
trading
it's
great
the
secret
is
avoiding
the
tech
companies
everyone
was
jumping
on
and
and
going
with
the
smaller
firms
that
supply
the
basic
components
uhhuh
anyway
i
took
the
money
from
working
for
giles
and
i
tripled
it
tripled
like
first
money
then
money
money
money
yes
i'm
thinking
about
buying
something
very
expensive
maybe
an
antelope
hi
hi
i'm
looking
for
warren
do
you
know
where
warren
is

a
machine

a
mold
of
some
sort
who's
that
warren

girl
tara

a
strange
evenness

precisely
well
some
of
us
like
that
kind
of
thing
in
a
girl

gonna
see
me
she
who
what's
up
warren
it
doesn't
matter
come
on
is
warren
here
i
thought
you
were
getting
the
crunchies
xander
got
hypnotized
by
the
strange
girl
i
am
remaining
calm
however
uhuh
no
i'm
i'm
right
with
you
you
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about
here
she
comes
i
heard
that
warren
was
here
is
warren
here
um
warren
who
he's
warren
and
he's
looking
for
me
he
lost
me
is
warren
here
it's
that
girl
again
is
she
still
looking
for
warren
weird
it's
been
like
all
day
there's
something
strange
about
her
she
talks
funny
some
men
find
that
appealing
have
you
guys
seen
warren
i
just
hope
she
finds
him
somehow
i
don't
think
a
girl
that
looks
like
that's
gonna
be
lonely
for
too
long
definitely
not
oh
not
me
i
i
was
just
saying
a
pretty
girl
like
that
there's
always
someone
lurking
around
looking
for
some
action
small
world
oh
dear
if
looks
could
stake
you
having
fun
pet
you
trolling
for
your
next
ex
i
gotta
say
you
can
do
better
i
told
you
i
wa
spike
thought
i
was
gonna
leave
town
it's
a
free
country
free
party
if
you
want
me
to
leave
you
can
put
your
hands
on
my
hot
tight
little
body
and
make
me
get
away
from
me
was
that
guy
bothering
you
should
i
um
offer
to
get
inappropriately
violent
or
something
no
good
'cause
honestly
i
don't
wanna
so
are
you
ready
to
dance
um
first
what's
that
uh
yeah
my
phone
number
i
was
gonna
try
to
subtly
work
it
into
the
conversation
but
it
didn't
pan
out
and
i
thought
i
should
try
to
give
it
to
you
before
you
see
me
dance
you
know
in
case
you
wanna
get
coffee
thank
you
um
i
i
just
ii
think
you
should
know
that
i

i
kind
of
have
this
bad
history
in
which
you
know
we
go
get
coffee
and
well
it
all
ends
with
with
you
leaving
town
and
you
just
got
here
and
everything
apparently
we'd
be
risking
a
tragic
chain
reaction
but
i
just
really
like
coffee
i
think
coffee
might
be
worth
it
and
i
would
like
to
get
to
know
coffee
better
then
i'll
call
you
have
you
seen
warren
no
sorry
and
who
are
you
darlin'
i'm
april
i'm
looking
for
my
fella
maybe
you
just
found
him
really
where
oh
hey
hey
hey
that
would
be
wrong
you
are
not
my
boyfriend
bloody
hell
you
threw
me
through
a
window
what's
that
about
you
do
not
make
those
suggestions
to
me
i
have
a
boyfriend
warren
is
my
boyfriend
you
know
what
my
bleeding
sympathies
to
warren
no
one
but
warren
can
touch
me
excuse
me
hi
um
uh
maybe
you
and
i
could
talk
you
know
'cause
throwing
spike
through
a
window
well
that's
really
good
um
but
you
know
generally
speaking
april
do
you
know
my
boyfriend
okay
i
think
you
need
to
take
a
second
and
stop
looking
for
your
boyfriend
i
have
to
find
him
if
i
hurt
you
just
now
i'm
sorry
and
i
hope
that
your
boyfriend
will
take
good
care
of
you
ow
i
don't
know
about
you
guys
but
i've
had
it
with
superstrong
little
women
who
aren't
me
well
at
least
she
didn't
do
too
much
damage
are
you
kidding
doubleglazed
windows
ain't
cheap
and
the
jamb
needs
to
be
completely
repaired
oh
dear
god
i'm
the
grownup
who
sees
the
world
through
my
job
i'm
like
my
uncle
dave
the
plumber
i
must
be
shunned
okay
so
what
do
you
guys
think
she
is
i
mean
this
may
sound
nuts
but
i
kinda
got
the
impression
that
she
was
a
tara
robot
oh
yeah
robot
yeah
i
was
gonna
say
robot
what
do
you
think
she
wants
warren
whoever
that
is
it's
gotta
be
the
guy
that
built
her
it's
an
unusual
name
there's
hardly
any
except
warren
beatty
and
you
know
president
harding
itit's
probably
not
either
of
them
will
can
you
track
down
this
guy
with
only
a
first
name
given
enough
time
i
can
get
a
list
of
the
sunnydale
students
named
warren
tonight
but
then
we'll
have
to
call
them
or
go
to
their
dorms
so
we
probably
can't
start
narrowing
it
down
till
tomorrow
she
could
do
a
lot
of
damage
by
then
to
who
spike
see
how
vigorously
i
don't
care
she
was
looking
for
this
warren
but
it
didn't
sound
like
she
wanted
to
hurt
him
she
said
he's
her
boyfriend
i
agree
i'm
not
sure
this
is
a
code
red
hey
is
there
a
code
pink
we
need
more
codes
okay
we'll
track
down
warren
tomorrow
tonight
i
better
go
rescue
giles
he's
been
watching
dawn
while
my
mom's
out
on
her
date
and
i
have
a
feeling
there's
only
so
much
he
can
take
oh
giles
and
dawnie
i
bet
they
ended
up
having
a
blast
dear
god
buffy
there's
only
so
much
i
can
take
we're
going
to
have
to
change
the
system
a
fourteenyearold's
too
old
to
be
babysat
and
it's
not
fair
on
her
what'd
she
make
you
do
um
well
we
listened
to
aggressively
cheerful
music
sung
by
people
chosen
for
their
ability
to
dance
then
we
ate
cookie
dough
and
talked
about
boys
i'm
sorry
i'm
very
very
sorry
but
if
it
makes
you
feel
any
better
my
'fun
time
buffy
party
night'
involved
watching
a
robot
throw
spike
through
a
window
so
if
you
wanna
trade
no
wait
i
wouldn't
give
that
memory
up
for
anything
a
robot
sounds
interesting
we're
gonna
work
on
it
in
the
morning
i
mean
unless
you
wanna
stay
for
a
while
and
then
you
and
i
could
joyce
appears
behind
giles
entering
the
house
with
a
big
smile
who
wants
to
hear
everything
listen
to
my
mom
talk
about
boys
right
must
go
see
you
tomorrow

didn't
see
prince
charming
i
didn't
even
see

goodnight

pretty
tame
to
me

i
suppose
by
your
standards
it
could
seem
pretty

bra

over
in
dutton
i've
got
a
local
address
where
his
folks
still
live
he's
probably
home
for
spring
break
well
i'll
go
talk
to
him
no
no
no
no
no
wait
we
don't
know
what
you're
walking
into
uh
we
have
no
idea
what
his
motive
is
for
building
this
thing
um
don't
you
think
se's
just
yeah
she's
just
sort
of
a
she's
a
sexbot
i
mean
what
guy
doesn't
dream
about
that
beautiful
girl
with
no
other
thought
but
to
please
you
willing
to
do
anything
too
many
girls
i
miss
oz
he'd
get
it
he
wouldn't
say
anything
but
he'd
get
it
why
would
anyone
do
that
if
they
could
have
a
real
live
person
maybe
he
couldn't
find
a
real
person
oh
come
on
the
guy's
just
a
big
wedge
of
sleaze
don't
make
excuses
for
him
i'm
not
i'm
just
saying
people
get
lonely
and
maybe
having
someone
around
even
someone
you
made
up
maybe
it's
easier
but
it's
so
weird
i
mean
everyone
wants
a
nice
normal
person
to
share
with
but
this
guy
if
he
couldn't
find
that
i
guess
it's

was
afraid
of

misrepresentations
misunderstandings
slurs
and
allegations
i
don't
know
what
buffy
told
you
but
the
thing
is
the
slayer

i
worked
together
side
by
side
to
get
rid
of
dru
who
was
up
to
no
good
and
i
don't
mind
telling
you
giles
spike
listen
to
me
it's
just
i'm
trying
to
explain
she
might
have
said
some
things
that
sounded
like
i
expressed
some
kind
of
feeling
giles
shoves
spike
backward
he
stumbles
into
a
bookshelf
giles
walks
slowly
up
to
him
glaring
angrily
we
are
not
your
friends
we
are
not
your
way
to
buffy
there
is
no
way
to
buffy
clear
out
of
here
and
spike
this
thing
get
over
it
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
yes
you
do
move
the
hell
on
i'm
looking
for
my
boyfriend
warren
what
he
comes
from
here
and
i
need
him
but
it's
confusing
and
i've
already
walked
a
really
long
way
i'm
sure
he's
nearby
oh
warren
you're
looking
for
warren
yes
do
you
know
him
do
you
know
where
he
is
man
let
me
think
please
think
geez
this
is
too
bad
you
you
just
missed
him
yes
where
did
he
go
warren
uh
he
headed
out
uh
that
way
hurry
you
might
catch
him
oh
thank
you
i
was
getting
very
tired
thank
you
who's
warren
hell
if
i
know
so
you
have
girl
troubles
they're
not
talking
to
you
you're
not
gettin'
dates
you
start
thinking
'hey
this
isn't
fair'
warren
yeah
i
mean
i
felt
like
i
deserved
to
have
someone
you
know
i
mean
everyone
deserves
to
have
someone
so
naturally
you
turned
to
manufacturing
kinda
and
how
long
did
it
take
to
build
yourself
that
little
toy
oh
no
she's
not
a
toy
i
mean
i
know
what
you're
thinking
but
she's
more
than
that
i'm
sure
she
has
many
exciting
laborsaving
attachments
no
i
made
her
to
love
me
i
mean
she
cares
about
what
i
care
about
and
she
wants
to
be
with
me
she
listens
to
me
and
supports
me
i
didn't
make
a
toy
i
made
a
girlfriend
a
girlfriend
are
you
saying
are
you
in
love
with
her
i
really
thought
i
would
be
i
mean
she's
perfect
i
don't
know
i
i
guess
it
was
too
easy
and
predictable
you
know
she
got
boring
she
was
exactly
what
i
wanted
and
i
didn't
want
her
i
thought
i
was
going
crazy
really
you
then
something
happened
katrina
was
in
my
engineering
seminar
and
she
was
really
funny
and
cool
you
know
she
was
always
givin'
me
a
hard
time
real
unpredictable
she
builds
these
little
model
monorails
that
run
with
magnets
and

anyway
i
fell
in
love
with
katrina
swell
romance
and
magnetic
trains
but
first
you
decided
to
take
april
out
of
the
box
play
with
her
for
five
minutes
and
then
what
you
got
bored
decided
to
dump
her
tell
her
to
go
away
kinda
and
she
got
mad
she
didn't
go
huh
okay
i
didn't
really
dump
her
as
much
as
i
uh
went
out
and
uh
didn't
come
back
i
left
her
i
left
her
in
my
dorm
room
you
left
her
in
your
dorm
room
well
i
figured
i
could
just
kinda
get
away
until
her
batteries
gave
out
which
should
have
been
days
ago
did
you
even
tell
her
i
mean
did
you
even
give
her
a
chance
to
fix
what
was
wrong
i
didn't
need
to
fix
anything
i
mean
her
batteries
were
supposed
to
run
down
really
they
should
be
completely
dead
by
now
so
why
aren't
they
i
don't
i
don't
know
i
mean
maybe
uh
she
must
be
recharging
them
somehow
warren
this
is
important
is
she
dangerous
she's
only
programmed
to
be
in
love
then
she's
dangerous
do
you
have
any
idea
how
to
find
her
well
she's
looking
for
me
so
my
guess
is
she's
probably
pretty
close
hi

you
know
where
warren
is
i
need
to
get

i
made
it
so
that
if

of
feedback

supposed
to

i
was
a
good
girlfriend
i'm
sure
you
were
i'm
only
supposed
to
love
him
if
i
can't
do
that
what
am
i
for
what
do
i
exist
for
i
don't
know
it
isn't
fair
he
wasn't
fair
to
you
it's
getting
dark
it's
so
early
to
be
dark
yeah
what
if
he
comes
back
and
he
can't
find
me
in
the
dark
i'm
here
i'll
make
sure
that
he
finds
you
maybe
this
is
a
girlfriend
test
if
i
wait
here
patiently
this
time
he'll
come
back
i'm
sure
he
will
and
he'll
he'll
tell
you
how
sorry
he
is
you
know
he
told
me
how
proud
he
was
of
you
and
how
impressed
he
was
with
how
much
you
loved
him
and
how
you
tried
to
help
him
he
didn't
mean
to
hurt
you
he's
going
to
take
me
home
and
things
will
be
right
again
it'll
be
fine
when
things
are
sad
you
just
have
to
be
patient
because
because
every
cloud
has
a
silver
lining
and
when
life
gives
you
lemons
make
lemonade
clouds
and
lemonade
huh
yes
and
and

things
are
always
darkest
before
see
you
construct
the
wood
jamb
and
frame
the
glass
into
it
and
that's
what
you
set
into
the
opening
yeah
one
of
the
cool
things
about
that
you
see
is
uh
the
jamb
can
be
shimmed
to
be
square
even
if
the
opening
isn't
shimmed
is
that
even
a
real
word
do
you
have
any
idea
what
you're
talking
about
yeah
i
do
scary
isn't
it
i
think
i've
actually
turned
into
someone
you
want
around
after
a
crazed
robot
attack
and
if
you
ever
start
your
own
business
you
have
your
slogan
right
there
and
she
wasn't
crazed
yeah
she
devoted
everything
to
making
this
one
person
happy
and
then
it
was
like
with
him
gone
there
was
just
no
reason
for
her
to
exist
any
more
robots
are
the
strangest
people
no
people
are
the
strangest
people
i
mean
look
at
me
obsessing
about
being
with
someone
it's
like
i
don't
need
a
guy
right
now
i
need
me
i
need
to
get
comfortable
being
alone
with
buffy

pretty
cool
person
to
be
alone
