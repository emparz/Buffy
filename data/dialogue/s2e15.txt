of
them

thing
they
all

an
'f'

minutes

'sharing

misery'
thing

welldeserved
darn
tootin'
i'm
just
saying
xander
and
cordelia
i
mean
what
does
he

her
anyway
but
what
could
she
possibly
see
in
him
excuse
me
we
didn't
come
here
to
talk
about
willow
we
came
here
to
do
things
i
can
never
tell
my
father
about
because
he
still
thinks
i'm
a
good
girl
i
just
don't
trust
oz
with
her
i
mean
he's
a
senior
he's
attractive
okay
maybe
not
to
me
but
and
he's
in
a
band
and
we
know
what
kind
of
element
that
attracts
i've
dated
lots
of
guys
in
bands
thank
you
do
you
even
wanna
be
here
i'm
not
running
away
because
when
you're
not
babbling
about
poor
defenseless
willow
you
are
raving
about
the
allpowerful
buffy
i
do
not
babble
i
occasionally
runon
every
now
and
then
i
yammer
xander
yeah
look
around
we're
in
my
daddy's
car
it's
just
the
two
of
us
there
is
a
beautiful
big
full
moon
outside
tonight
it
doesn't
get
more
romantic
than
this
so
shut
up
did
you
hear
that
what
is
it
now
i
thought
i
heard
something
iis
willow
sending
out
some
sorta
distress
signal
that
only
you
can
hear
huh
okay
now
i
know
i
heard
something
alright
that's
it
you
know
your
mind
hasn't
been
here
all
night
how
about
i
just
drop
you
off
get
us
outta
here
where
are
the
keys
we
should
be
moving
let's
go
oh
i
got
'em
got
'em
told
ya
i
heard
something
and
you're
sure
it
was
a
werewolf
well
let's
see
um
six
feet
tall
claws
a
big
old
snout
in
the
middle
of
his
face
like
a
wolf
um
yeah
i'm
sticking
with
my
first
guess
seems
wise
oh
oh
and
then
there
was
that
little
thing
where
it
tried
to
bite
us
it
was
so
awful
i
know
daddy
just
had
this
car
detailed
so
what's
the
word
well
it
seems
there
were
a
a
number
of
other
attacks
by
a
wild
dog
around
town
several
animal
carcasses
were
found
mutilated
you
mean
like
bunnies
and
stuff
no
don't
tell
me
oh
don't
worry
i
mean
they
might
not
look
it
but
bunnies
can
really
take
care
of
themselves
yeah
yeah
yes
uh
um
fortunately
no
people
were
injured
that
falls
into
the
'that's
a
switch'
column
well
for
now
but
my
guess
is
that
this
werewolf
will
be
back
at
next
month's
full
moon
what
about
tonight's
full
moon
pardon
well
last
night
was
the
night
before
the
full
moon
traditionally
known
as
'the
night
before
the
full
moon'
giles
meaning
the
accepted
legend
that
werewolves
only
prowl
during
a
full
moon
might
be
erroneous
or
it
could
be
a
crock
unless
the
werewolf
was
using
last
year's
almanac
looks
like
giles
has
some
schooling
to
do
yes
i
must
admit
i
i
am
intrigued
werewolves
it's
it's
one
of
the
classics
i
i'm
sure
my
books
and
i
are
in
for
a
fascinating
afternoon
he
needs
to
get
a
pet
sunnydale
is
becoming
more
dangerous
all
the
time
and
a
full
moon
like
tonight
tends
to
bring
out
the
crazies
but
with
some
simple
basics
of
selfdefense
each
of
you
can
learn
how
to
protect
yourself
here's
a
suggestion
move
away
from
the
hellmouth
what
you
wanna
do
is
gain
advantage
of
the
situation
as
quickly
as
possible
tag
your
attacker
may
have
the
benefit
of
surprise
would
you
look
at
that
he's
all
over
her
but
if
you
plot
ahead
psst
hey
buddy
this
is
a
public
forum
here
then
you
can
turn
that
advantage
to
yourself
i
think
you
splashed
on
just
a
little
too
much
'obsession
for
dorks'
by
being
prepared
you
have
the
power
okay
everyone
get
into
your
assigned
groups
what
happened
oh
last
week
some
huge
dog
jumped
out
of
the
bushes
and
bit
me
i've
been
there
man
my
cousin
jordy
just
got
his
grownup
teeth
in
does
not
like
to
be
tickled
theresa
be
still
my
shorts
we're
in
the
same
group
i
may
have
to
attack
you
no
aaactually
i
think
uh
in
our
group
there
are
a
few
of
us
and
i'm
one
of
the
few
don't
forget
you're
supposed
to
be
a
meek
little
girliegirl
like
the
rest
of
us
spoil
my
fun
okay
everyone
listen
up
i
wanna
show
you
what
to
do
should
you
be
attacked
from
behind
in
this
situation
bend
forward
using
your
back
and
shoulders
uhh
uhh
oh
summers
you
are
turning
me
on
that
works
too
and
uh
while
there's
absolutely
no
scientific
explanation
for
lunar
effect
on
the
human
psyche
uh
the
phases
of
the
moon
uh
do
seem
to
exert
a
great
deal
of
psychological
influence
and
ththe
full
moon
is
is
seems
to
bring
out
our
darkest
qualities
and
yet
ironically
uh
led
to
the
invention
of
the
moon
pie
oh
yes
the
moon
pie
yyou
see
uh
thethe
werewolf
uh
is
such
a
a
potent
eeextreme
representation
of
our
inborn
animalistic
traits
that
it
eemerges
for
three
full
consecutive
nights
the
full
moon
and
uh
the
two
nights
surrounding
it
quite
the
party
animal
quite
and
it
uh
acts
onon
pure
instinct
no
conscience
uh
uh
predatory
and
and
aggressive
in
other
words
your
typical
male
on
behalf
of
my
gender
hey
yes
let's
not
jump
to
any
conclusions
i
didn't
jump
i
took
a
tiny
step
and
there
conclusions
were
the
point
is
that
our
wolfman
could
also
be
aaa
wolfwoman
or
or
anyone
who
was
bitten
by
a
werewolf
so
then
i'm
guessing
your
standard
silver
bullets
are
in
order
here
no
no
bullets
no
matter
who
this
werewolf
is
iit's
still
a
human
being
who
may
be
completely
unaware
of
his
or
her
condition
so
tonight
we
bring
'em
back
alive
anything
yet
yes
and
you
won't
believe
what
i
saw
brittany
podell
was
making
out
with
owen
stadeel
but
he
goes
with
barrett
williams
if
she
ever
found
no
um
no
no
sign
of
the
werewolf
how
about
you
uh
the
same
i
thought
we
might
uh
i
thought
we
might
knock
on
a
few
windows
uh
ask
if
anyone
has
seen
anything
yet
giles
no
one's
seen
anything
oh
yes
no
ofofof
course
not
no
yes
gotcha
what
the
hell
giles
giles
hey
whoa
hands
are
good
right
about
there
who
who
are
you
what
are
you
doing
the
name's
cain
i'm
the
one
with
the
gun
which
means
i'm
the
one
who
gets
to
do
the
interviewing
ahem
hey
before
we
get
all
chummy
here
how
about
we
do
something
about
me
being
in
this
net
thing
you
alright
yeah
gotta
say
i'm
impressed
excuse
me
well
it's
good
to
get
the
fruit
while
it's
fresh
you'd
be
wise
to
take
that
back
hey
what
a
man
and
a
girl
do
in
lovers'
lane
at
night
is
nobody's
busi
oh
okay
hey
enough
repulsive
brain
it's
not
what
you
think
we're
hunting
werewolves
okay
it's
funny
if
you
don't
believe
in
werewolves
no
it's
funny
thinking
about
you
two
catching
one
i
mean
this
guy
looks
like
he's
auditioning
to
be
a
librarian
and
you
well
you're
a
girl
i
assure
you
she's
quite
capable
uhhuh
lemme
ask
you
something
sweetheart
exactly
how
many
of
these
animals
have
you
taken
out
as
of
today
i
tore
a
tooth
from
the
mouth
of
every
werewolf
that
i
killed
this
next
one
will
bring
the
total
to
an
even
dozen
so
you're
just
gonna
kill
it
well
see
that's
the
thing
their
pelts
fetch
a
pretty
penny
in
sri
lanka
and
it's
a
little
hard
to
skin
'em
when
they're
alive
yyou
hunt
werewolves
ffor
sport
no
no
i'm
in
it
purely
for
the
money
and
it
doesn't
bother
you
that
a
werewolf
is
a
person
twenty
eight
days
out
of
the
month
that's
why
i
only
hunt
'em
the
other
three
i'd
really
love
to
stay
and
chat
but
i'm
on
a
tight
schedule
any
idea
where
else
the
boys
and
girls
like
to
get
together
around
here
you're
looking
for
a
party
no
but
the
werewolf
is
they're
suckers
for
that
whole
sexual
heat
thing
sense
it
miles
away
since
this
little
doggie
ain't
here
i
guess
he
found
another
place
sorry
wish
i
could
help
you
but
you
don't
know
squat
gee
what
a
surprise
where
are
we
going
i
think
i
know
where
to
look
we
just
have
to
make
it
there
before
mein
furrier
everything
okay
yeah
i
just
uh
i
i
thought
i
heard
something
behind
me
no
one
there
oh
i
guess
i
was
wrong
i
could
have
sworn
that
it's
okay
it
can
get
pretty
scary
out
here
all
alone
at
night
yeah
hey
don't
i
know
you
from
somewhere
don't
you
go
to
school
with
buffy
oh
you
know
buffy
yes
i
do
very
well
oh
come
on
i'll
get
you
home
and
then
sweep
this
town
into
a
monster
truck
of
shame
carved
out
of
soap
and
steel
and
clay
and
salty
fame
you
are
the
first
to
look
away
and
against
me
you
shake
the
squirrel
out
your
tree
cut
to
cordelia
and
willow
sitting
on
opposite
sides
of
a
couch
by
a
low
table
i
mean
with
xander
it's
always
'buffy
did
this'
'willow
said
that'
buffy
buffy
willow
willow
it's
like
i
don't
even
exist
i
sometimes
feel
like
that
and
then
when
i
call
him
on
it
he
acts
all
confused
like
i'm
the
one
with
the
problem
his
'do
i
smell
something'
look
all
a
part
of
his
little
guy
games
it's
like
he's
there
but
then
he's
not
there
and
he
wants
it
but
then
he
doesn't
want
it
he's
so
busy
looking
around
at
everything
he
doesn't
have
he
doesn't
even
realize
what
he
does
have
well
he
should
at
least
realize
that
you
have
oz
mm
i'm
not
sure
i
do
oz
and
i
are
in
some
sort
of
holding
pattern
except
without
the
holding
or
anything
else
what's
he
waiting
for
what's
his
problem
yeah
him
and
xander
guys
who
do
they
think
they
are
a
couple
of
guys
looks
as
though
your
hunch
was
right
who
could
resist
sunnydale's
own
house
of
hormones
the
werewolf
it's
in
there
coming
through
you
let
it
get
away
i
didn't
let
it
do
anything
i
had
the
chain
around
its
neck
chain
what
were
you
gonna
do
take
it
for
a
walk
i
was
going
to
lock
it
up
that's
beautiful
this
is
what
happens
when
a
woman
tries
to
do
a
man's
job
now
you
look
here
mr
cain
this
girl
risked
her
life
trying
to
capture
a
beast
that
you
haven't
as
yet
been
able
to
find
uhhuh
and
daddy's
doing
a
great
job
carrying
her
bag
of
milk
bones
you
know
sis
if
that
thing
out
there
harms
anyone

going
to
be
on
your
pretty
little
head

live
with
that
i
live
with
that
every
day
first
they
tell
me
i
can't
hunt
an
elephant
for
its
ivory

gotta
deal
with

ethical
treatment
of

something
to
howl
about
hmm
but
while
we
hang
here
doing
nothing
there's
a
human
werewolf
walking
around
out
there
probably
making
fun
of
us
the
way
werewolves
always
do
but
there's
really
no
way
to
tell
who
it
is
oh
sure
there
is
giles
knows
stuff
and
i'm
practically
an
expert
on
the
subject
on
account
of
once
you
were
a
hyena
i
know
what
it's
like
to
crave
the
taste
of
freshly
killed
meat
to
be
taken
over
by
those
uncontrollable
urges
you
said
you
didn't
remember
anything
about
that
i
said
i
didn't
remember
anything
about
that
look
the
point
is
is
i
have
an
affinity
with
this
thing
i
can
get
inside
of
its
head
i'm
a
big
bad
wolf
i'm
on
the
prowl
i'm
sniffing
i'm
snarling
i'm
a
slobbering
predator
i'm
wait
a
second
it's
right
in
front
of
us
it's
obvious
who
i
am
i'm
larry
the
guy's
practically
got
wolfboy
stamped
on
his
forehead
you
got
the
dog
bite
you
got
the
aggression
not
to
mention
the
excessive
back
hair
and
he
was
awfully
gleeful
about
tormenting
theresa
still
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
i'm
gonna
go
talk
to
him
gonna
force
a
confession
out
of
him
good
go
uh
in
the
meantime
we
need
to
cover
our
bases
where
are
we
going
iif
none
of
that
works
i
think
i
may
have
an
alternative
yeah
me
and
the
werewolf
alone
in
a
cage
for
three
minutes
that's
all
i
ask
are
you
okay
what
you
kind
of
knew
theresa
oh
yeah
i
uh
i'm
trying
not
to
think
about
it
it's
it's
a
lot
it
is
but
we
can
do
stuff
to
help
sometimes
it
feels
good
to
help
uhhuh
well
like
looking
up
stuff
i'm
gonna
be
doing
that
most
of
the
night
you
could
help
me
help
together
i
can't
um
uh
i'm
busy
oh
so
i
i
gotta
go
harris
sheesh
next
time
wear
a
bell
why
so
jumpy
larry
geeks
make
me
nervous
is
that
really
it
or
is
there
something
you're
hiding
i
could
hide
my
fist
in
your
face
i
know
your
secret
big
guy
i
know
what
you've
been
doing
at
night
you
know
harris
that
nosey
little
nose
of
yours
is
going
to
get
you
into
trouble
someday
like
today
hurting
me
isn't
gonna
make
this
go
away
people
are
still
gonna
find
out
alright
what
do
you
want
hush
money
is
that
what
you're
after
i
don't
want
anything
i
just
wanna
help
what
you
think
you
have
a
cure
no
it's
just
i
know
what
you're
going
through
because
i've
been
there
that's
why
i
know
you
should
talk
about
it
yeah
that's
easy
for
you
to
say
i
mean
you're
nobody
i've
got
a
reputation
here
larry
please
before
someone
else
gets
hurt
look
if
this
gets
out
it's
over
for
me
i
mean
forget
about
playing
football
they'll
run
me
outta
this
town
i
mean
come
on
how
are
people
going
to
look
at
me
after
they
find
out
i'm
gay
oh
wow
i
said
it
and
it
felt
okay
i'm
gay
i
am
gay
i
heard
you
the
first
time
i
can't
believe
it
it
was
almost
easy
i
never
felt
i
could
tell
anyone
and
then
you
you
of
all
people
you
bring
it
outta
me
it
probably
would
have
slipped
out
even
if
i
wasn't
here
no
no
because
knowing
you
went
through
the
same
thing
made
it
easier
for
me
to
admit
it
the
same
thing
it's
ironic
i
mean
all
those
times
i
beat
the
crap
out
of
you
it
musta
been
because
i
recognized
something
in
you
that
i
didn't
want
to
believe
about
myself
larry
no
i
am
not
of
course
of
course
not
don't
worry
i
wouldn't
do
that
to
you
your
secret's
safe
with
me
wow
so
what's
the
scuttlebutt
anybody
besides
larry
fit
our
werewolf
profile
there
is
one
name
that
keeps
getting
spit
out
aggressive
behavior
runins
with
authorities
about
a
screenful
of
violent
incidents
okay
most
of
those
were
not
my
fault
somebody
else
started
'em
i
was
just
standing
up
for
myself
they
say
it's
a
good
idea
to
count
to
ten
when
you're
angry
one
two
three
i'll
keep
looking
i
um
noticed
you
were
looking
solo
yeah
oz
wanted
to
be
someplace
that
was
i'm
sorry
i
can't
figure
him
out
i
mean
he's
so
hot
and
cold
or
lukewarm
and
cold
welcome
to
the
mystery
that
is
men
i
think
it
goes
something
like
they
grow
body
hair
they
lose
all
ability
to
tell
you
what
they
really
want
it
doesn't
seem
like
a
fair
trade
well
if
you
wanna
up
the
speed
quotient
with
oz
maybe
you
need
to
do
something
daring
maybe
you
need
to
make
the
first
move
well
that
won't
make
me
a
slut
i
think
your
reputation
will
remain
intact
it
used
to
be
so
much
easier
to
tell
if
a
boy
liked
you
he'd
punch
you
on
the
arm
and
then
run
back
to
his
friends
those
were
the
days
hey
i'll
see
you
guys
later
cordelia
asked
me
to
look
over
her
history
homework
before
class
i
think
that
means
i
might
have
to
do
it
wow
those
two
gals
are
hanging
out
a
lot
together
this
would
be
a
good
time
to
panic
so
how'd
it
go
with
larry
what's
that
supposed
to
mean
i
think
it's
supposed
to
mean
'so
how'd
it
go
with
larry'
he's
not
the
werewolf
can't
we
just
leave
it
at
that
must
you
continue
to
push
and
push
i'm
sorry
i
was
just
wondering
well
he's
not
okay
okay
but
there
goes
our
lead
suspect
you're
not
boned
you're
buffy
eradicator
of
evil
defender
of
um
things
that
need
defending
tell
that
to
theresa
she
could
have
used
my
defending
before
she
was
ripped
apart
by
that
werewolf
nowhere
in
any
of
the
reports
did
it
say
anything
about
her
being
mauled
i
mean
they
were
linked
to
the
animal
attacks
from
the
other
night
so
we
just
assumed
werewolf
what
else
should
we
have
assumed
vampire
so
that's
good
right
i
mean
in
the
sense
of
the
werewolf
didn't
get
her
and
no
there
is
no
good
here
no
good
instead
of
not
protecting
theresa
from
the
werewolf
i
was
able
to
not
protect
her
from
something
just
as
bad
she
had
a
lot
of
friends
buffy
you
can't
blame
yourself
for
every
death
that
happens
in
sunnydale
if
it
weren't
for
you
people'd
be
lined
up
five
deep
waitin'
to
get
themselves
buried
willow
would
be
robbie
the
robot's
love
slave
i
wouldn't
even
have
a
head
and
theresa's
a
vampire
angel
sends
his
love
angel
are
you
okay
this
isn't
happening
he's
gonna
keep
coming
after
me
don't
let
him
get
to
you
he's
not
the
same
guy
you
knew
oh
no
my
life's
not
too
complicated
willow
what
are
you
doing
i
had
this
whole
thing
worked
out
and
i
had
it
written
down
uh
but
then
it
didn't
make
any
sense
when
i
was
reading
it
back
willow
this
is
not
a
very
good
time
i
mean
what
am
i
supposed
to
think
first
you
buy
me
popcorn
and
then
you're
all
glad
that
i
didn't
get
bit
and
you
put
the
tag
back
in
my
shirt
but
i
guess
none
of
that
means
anything
because
instead
of
looking
up
names
with
me
here
you
are
all
alone
in
your
house
doing
nothing
by
yourself
willow
we'll
talk
about
this
tomorrow
i
promise
no
damn
it
we'll
talk
about
this
now
buffy
told
me
that
sometimes
what
a
girl
makes
has
to
be
the
first
move
and
now
that
i'm
saying
this
i'm
starting
to
think
that
the
written
version
sounded
pretty
good
but
you
know
what
i
mean
i
know
i
know
it's
me
i'm
i'm
goin'
through
some
changes
well
welcome
to
the
world
things
happen
don't
you
think
i'm
going
through
a
lot
not
like
me
oh
what
so
now
you're
special
you're
special
boy
with
chains
and
stuff
why
do
you
have
chains
and
stuff
willow
please
get
outta
here
oz
oz
what
is
it
what's
wrong
there
you
are
sorry
i'm
late
i
had
to
do
some
unscheduled
slayage
in
the
form
of
theresa
she's
a
vampire
was
angel
sent
her
to
me
a
little
token
of
his
affection
buffy
i'm
so
sorry
not
now
giles
we
can
all
have
ourselves
a
good
cry
after
we
bag
us
a
werewolf
all
set
let's
go
find
this
thing
one
question
how
exactly
do
we
find
this
thing
it's
oz
it's
oz
whwhat's
oz
the
werewolf
are
you
certain
can't
you
just
trust
me
on
this
hehe
said
he
was
going
through
all
these
changes
then
he
went
through
all
these
where
is
he
now
in
the
woods
let's
go
go
where
you're
not
gonna
kill
oz
yeah
he's
a
werewolf
but
he
doesn't
mean
to
be
don't
worry
willow
we're
not
going
to
hurt
him
i
put
enough
phenobarbital
in
this
thing
to
sink
a
small
elephant
it
should
be
enough
for
a
large
werewolf
that's
it
let
me
see
you
come
on
suppertime
good
doggy
now
play
dead
careful
damn
it
i
shot
oz
you
saved
us
no
wonder
this
town's
overrun
with
monsters
no
one
here's
man
enough
to
kill
'em
oh
i
wouldn't
be
too
sure
of
that
how
about
you
let
the
door
hit
you
in
the
ass
on
the
way
out
of
town
you
think
it'll
be
okay
he'll
be
a
little
sore
in
the
morning
but
he'll
be
oz
this
is
all
so
weird
i
mean
how
are
we
supposed
to
act
when
we
see
him
well
it's
gotta
be
weird
for
him
too
now
that
we
know
so
much
all
i
know
is
i'll
never
be
able
to
look
at
him
the
same
again
he's
still
a
human
being
most
of
the
time
who
are
we
talking
about
oz
who
are
you
talking
about
no
one
hey
let
me
get
those
thanks
hey
xander
look
about
what
you
did
i
i
owe
you
what'd
you
do
it's
really
nothing
we
should
be
talking
about
i
know
i
know
it's
just
well
thanks
that
was
weird
what
it's
not
okay
for
one
guy
to
like
another
guy
just
because
he
happened
to
be
in
the
locker
room
with
him
when
absolutely
nothing
happened
and
i
thought
i
told
you
not
to
push
all
i
meant
is
that
he
didn't
try
to
look
up
my
skirt
oh
oh
yeah
that's
that's
the
weirdness
weirdness
abounds
lately
maybe
it's
the
moon
that
does
stuff
to
people
i've
heard
that
certainly
gonna
put
a
strain
on
willow
and
oz's
relationship
what
relationship
i
mean
what
life
could
they
possibly
have
together
we're
talking
obedience
school
paper
training
oz
is
always
in
back
burying
their
things
and
that
kind
of
breed
can
turn
on
its
owner
i
don't
know
i
kinda
see
oz
as
the
loyal
type
all
i'm
saying
is
she's
not
safe
with
him
if
it
were
up
to
me
xander
it's
not
up
to
you
hey
hey
did
you
want
to
go
first
i
spoke
to
giles
he
said
i'll
be
okay
i
just
have
to
lock
myself
up
around
the
full
moon
only
he
used
more
words
than
that
and
a
globe
i'm
sorry
about
how
all
this
ended
up
with
me
shooting
you
and
all
it's
okay
i'm
i'm
sorry
i
almost
ate
you
it's
okay
i
kind
of
thought
you
would
have
told
me
i
didn't
know
what
to
say
i
mean
it's
not
everyday
you
find
out
you're
a
werewolf
that's
fairly
freaksome
it
may
take
a
couple
days
getting
used
to
yeah
it's
a
complication
so
maybe
it'd
be
best
if
i
just
sorta
what
well
you
know
like
stayed
out
of
your
way
for
awhile
i
don't
know
i'm
kind
of
okay
with
you
being
in
my
way
you
mean
you'd
still
well
i
like
you
you're
nice
and
you're
funny
and
you
don't
smoke
yeah
okay
werewolf
but
that's
not
all
the
time
i
mean
three
days
out
of
the
month
i'm
not
much
fun
to
be
around
either
you
are
quite
the
human
so
i'd
still
if
you'd
still
i'd
still
i'd
very
still
okay
no
biting
though
agreed
a
werewolf
in
love
