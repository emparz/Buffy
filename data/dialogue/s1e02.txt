no
get
off
hey
xander
xander
are
you
okay
man
something
hit
me
where's
jesse
i
don't
know
they
surrounded
us
that
girl
grabbed
him
and
took
off
which
way
i
don't
know
jesse
this
world
is
older
than
any
of
you
know
contrary
to
popular
mythology
it
did
not
begin
as
a
paradise
for
untold
eons
demons
walked
the
earth
they
made
it
their
home
their
their
hell
but
in
time
they
lost
their
purchase
on
this
reality
the
way
was
made
for
mortal
animals
for
for
man
all
that
remains
of
the
old
ones
are
vestiges
certain
magicks
certain
creatures
and
vampires
okay
this
is
where
i
have
a
problem
see
because
we're
talking
about
vampires
we're
having
a
talk
with
vampires
in
it
isn't
that
what
we
saw
last
night
no
no
ththose
weren't
vampires
those
were
just
guys
in
thundering
need
of
a
facial
or
maybe
they
had
rabies
it
could
have
been
rabies
aand
that
guy
turning
to
dust
just
a
trick
of
light
that's
exactly
what
i
said
the
first
time
i
saw
a
vampire
well
after
i
was
done
with
the
screaming
part
oh
i
i
need
to
sit
down
you
are
sitting
down
oh
good
for
me
so
vampires
are
demons
the
books
tell
the
last
demon
to
leave
this
reality
fed
off
a
human
mixed
their
blood
he
was
a
human
form
possessed
infected
by
the
demon's
soul
he
bit
another
and
another
and
so
they
walk
the
earth
feeding
killing
some
mixing
their
blood
with
others
to
make
more
of
their
kind
waiting
for
the
animals
to
die
out
and
the
old
ones
to
return
move
is
this
for
me
an
offering
master
he's
a
good
one
his
blood
is
pure
you've
tasted
it
i'm
your
faithful
dog
you
bring
me
scraps
i
i
didn't
mean
it
i
have
waited
for
three
score
years
i
have
waited
while
you
come
and
go
i
am
stuck
here
here
in
this
house
of
worship
my
ascension
is
almost
at
hand
pray
that
when
it
comes
i'm
in
a
better
mood
master
forgive
me
we
had
more
offerings
but
there
was
trouble
a
girl
and
there
was
a
girl
she
fought
well
and
she
knew
of
our
breed
it
is
possible
that
she
may
be
a
slayer
and
that
would
be
a
what
for
as
long
as
there
have
been
vampires
there's
been
the
slayer
one
girl
in
all
the
world
a
chosen
one
he
loves
doing
this
part
alright
the
slayer
hunts
vampires
buffy
is
a
slayer
don't
tell
anyone
well
i
think
that's
all
the
vampire
information
you
need
except
for
one
thing
how
do
you
kill
them
you
don't
i
do
well
jesse's
my
jesse
is
my
responsibility
i
let
him
get
taken
that's
not
true
if
you
hadn't
shown
up
they
would
have
taken
us
too
does
anybody
mind
if
i
pass
out
breathe
breathe
breathe
this
big
guy
luke
he
talked
about
an
offering
to
the
master
now
i
don't
know
what
or
who
but
if
they
weren't
just
feeding
then
jesse
may
still
be
alive
i'm
gonna
find
him
uh
this
may
be
the
dumb
question
but
shouldn't
we
call
the
police
and
they'd
believe
us
of
course
well
we
don't
have
to
say
vampires
we
we
could
just
say
that
there's
a
a
bad
man
they
couldn't
handle
it
even
of
they
did
show
up
they'd
only
come
with
guns
you
have
no
idea
where
they
took
jesse
i
looked
around
but
soon's
they
got
clear
of
the
graveyard
they
could
have
just
voom
they
can
fly
they
can
drive
oh
i
don't
remember
hearing
a
car
let's
take
an
enormous
intuitive
leap
shall
we
and
say
they
went
underground
vampires
really
jam
on
sewer
systems
you
can
get
anywhere
in
the
entire
town
without
catching
any
rays
but
i
didn't
see
any
access
around
there
well
there's
an
electrical
tunnel
that
runs
under
the
whole
town
if
we
had
a
diagnostic
of
the
tunnel
system
it
might
indicate
a
a
meeting
place
it
would
uh
i
suppose
we
could
go
to
the
building
commission
we
so
don't
have
time
uh
guys
there
may
be
another
way
a
slayer
have
you
any
proof
only
that
she
fought
me
and
yet
lives
hmm
very
nearly
proof
enough
i
can't
remember
the
last
time
that
happened
1843
madrid
he
caught
me
sleeping
she
mustn't
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
the
harvest
i
would
never
let
that
happen
don't
worry
about
it
i
believe
she'll
come
to
us
we
have
something
she
wants
if
she
is
a
slayer
and
this
boy
lives
she'll
try
to
save
him
i
thought
you
nothing
more
than
a
meal
boy
congratulations
you've
just
been
upgraded
to
bait
there
it
is
that
runs
under
the
graveyard
i
don't
see
any
access
so
all
the
city
plans
are
just
uh
open
to
the
public
um
well
iin
a
way
i
sort
of
stumbled
onto
them
when
i
accidentally
decrypted
the
city
council's
security
system
someone's
been
naughty
there's
nothing
here
this
is
useless
i
think
you're
being
a
bit
hard
on
yourself
you're
the
one
that
told
me
that
i
wasn't
prepared
enough
understatement
i
thought
i
was
on
top
of
everything
and
then
that
monster
luke
came
out
of
nowhere
what
he
didn't
come
out
of
nowhere
he
came
from
behind
me
i
was
facing
the
entrance
he
came
from
behind
me
and
he
didn't
follow
me
out
the
access
to
the
tunnels
is
in
the
mausoleum
the
girl
must
have
doubled
back
with
jesse
after
i
got
out
god
i
am
so
mentally
challenged
so
what's
the
plan
we
saddle
up
right
there's
no
'we'
okay
i'm
the
slayer
and
you're
not
i
knew
you'd
throw
that
back
in
my
face
xander
this
is
deeply
dangerous
i'm
inadequate
that's
fine
i'm
less
than
a
man
buffy
i'm
not
anxious
to
go
into
a
dark
place
full
of
monsters
but
i
do
want
to
help
i
need
to
well
then
help
me
i've
been
researching
this
harvest
affair
it
seems
to
be
some
sort
of
preordained
massacre
rivers
of
blood
hell
on
earth
quite
charmless
i'm
a
bit
fuzzy
however
on
the
details
it
may
be
that
you
can
wrest
some
information
from
that
dread
machine
that
was
a
bit
um
british
wasn't
it
welcome
to
the
new
world
i
want
you
to
go
on
the
'net
oh
sure
i
can
do
that
then
i'm
outta
here
if
jesse's
alive
i'll
bring
him
back
do
i
have
to
tell
you
to
be
careful
and
where
do
we
think
we're
going
we
i
me
we're
not
leaving
school
grounds
are
we
no
no
i'm
just
admiring
the
fence
you
know
this
is
quality
fence
work
because
if
we
were
leaving
schools
grounds
on
our
second
day
at
a
new
school
after
getting
kicked
out
of
our
old
school
for
delinquent
behavior
do
you
see
where
i'm
going
with
this
mr
giles
what
he
asked
me
to
get
a
book
for
him
uh
from
the
store
'cause
i
have
a
free
period
and
i'm
a
big
reader
did
it
mention
that
in
my
transcripts
mr
giles
ask
him
well
maybe
that's
how
they
do
things
in
britain
they've
got
that
royal
family
and
all
kinds
of
problems
but
here
at
sunnydale
nobody
leaves
campus
while
school's
in
session
are
we
clear
we're
clear
that's
the
buffy
summers
i
want
in
my
school
sensible
girl
with
her
feet
on
the
ground
murder
death
disaster
what
else
paranormal
unexplained
did
you
get
natural
disasters
earthquake
flood
rain
of
toads
right
rain
of
toads
do
you
think
they'd
have
anything
like
that
in
the
paper
i'll
put
it
on
the
computer
search
if
it's
in
there
it'll
turn
up
anything
that'll
lead
us
to
vampires
and
i
in
the
meantime
will
help
by
standing
around
like
an
idiot
not
like
an
idiot
just
standing
buffy
doesn't
want
you
getting
hurt
i
don't
want
you
getting
hurt
this
is
just
too
much
i
mean
yesterday
my
life's
like
'uh
oh
pop
quiz'
today
it's
'rain
of
toads'
i
know
and
everyone
else
thinks
it's
just
a
normal
day
nobody
knows
it's
like
we've
got
this
big
secret
we
do
that's
what
a
secret
is
when
you
know
something
other
guys
don't
right
look
maybe
you
should
get
to
class
you
mean
'we'
we
should
get
to
class
yeah
buffy'll
be
okay
whatever's
down
there
i
think
she
can
handle
it
yeah
i
do
too
so
do
i
i
don't
suppose
you've
got
a
key
on
you
they
really
don't
like
me
dropping
in
why
not
they
really
don't
like
me
how
could
that
possibly
be
i
knew
you'd
figure
out
this
entryway
sooner
or
later
actually
i
thought
it
was
gonna
be
a
little
sooner
sorry
you
had
to
wait
okay
look
if
you're
gonna
be
popping
up
with
this
cryptic
wise
man
act
on
a
regular
basis
can
you
at
least
tell
me
your
name
angel
angel
it's
a
pretty
name
don't
go
down
there
deal
with
my
going
you
shouldn't
be
putting
yourself
at
risk
tonight
is
the
harvest
unless
you
can
prevent
it
the
master
walks
well
if
this
harvest
thing
is
such
a
suckfest
why
don't
you
stop
it
'cause
i'm
afraid
they'll
be
expecting
you
i've
got
a
friend
down
there
or
at
least
a
potential
friend
do
you
know
what
it's
like
to
have
a
friend
that
wasn't
supposed
to
be
a
stumper
when
you
hit
the
tunnels
head
east
towards
the
school
that's
where
you're
likely
to
find
them
you
gonna
wish
me
luck
good
luck
did
you
see
anything
xander
what
are
you
doing
here
something
stupid
i
followed
you
well
you
i
couldn't
just
sit
at
home
and
do
nothing
i
understand
now
go
away
no
xander
you're
gonna
have
to
look
jesse's
my
bud
okay
if
i
can
help
him
out
that's
what
i
gotta
do
besides
it's
this
or
chem
class
okay
so
crosses
garlic
stake
through
the
heart
that'll
get
it
done
cool
of
course
i
don't
actually
have
any
of
those
things
good
thinking
well
the
part
of
my
brain
that
would
tell
me
to
bring
that
stuff
is
still
busy
telling
me
not
to
come
down
here
i
have
this
though
turn
that
off
okay
okay
so
what
else
what
else
what
for
vampire
slayage
oh
fire
beheading
sunlight
holy
water
the
usual
you've
done
some
beheading
in
your
time
oh
yeah
there
was
this
time
i
was
pinned
down
by
this
guy
that
played
left
tackle
for
varsity
well
at
least
he
used
to
before
he
was
a
vampire
anyway
he
had
this
really
really
thick
neck
and
all
i
had
was
a
little
little
exacto
knife
you're
not
loving
this
story
no
actually
i
find
it
oddly
comforting
'for
they
will
gather
and
be
gathered
from
the
vessel
pours
life'
p
pours
life
'on
the
night
of
the
crescent
moon
the
first
past
the
solstice
it
will
come'
of
course
that's
tonight
no
it's
supposed
to
find
the
syntax
and
match
it
or
wait
are
we
going
to
the
bronze
tonight
no
we're
going
to
the
other
cool
place
in
sunnydale
of
course
we're
going
to
the
bronze
friday
night
no
cover
but
you
should
have
been
there
last
night
'cause
i
ran
into
buffy
and
can
she
be
any
weirder
she
attacked
me
do
you
believe
it
i
think
we
did
this
part
wrong
why
do
we
have
to
devise
these
programs
isn't
that
what
nerds
are
for
what'd
she
do
uh
she's
doing
something
else
okay
and
then
pattern
run
right
or
go
to
end
that's
it
maybe
so
anyway
i
come
outta
the
bathroom
and
she
comes
running
at
me
screaming
with
a
stick
'i'm
gonna
kill
you
i'm
gonna
kill
you'
i
swear
who
buffy
the
new
girl
what's
her
deal
well
she's
crazed
did
you
hear
about
her
old
school
booted

exhibit
no
surprise
why
was
she
kicked
out
uh
because

a
psycho
loony

she's
not
a
psycho
you
don't
even
know
her
excuse
me
who
gave
you
permission
to
exist

i
horn
in
on
your
private
discussions

why
because

think

program's
done

the
nightmare

it

your
instrument

most
hallowed
night

luke

anything
that
can
make
this
day
any
worse
how
about
the
end
of
the
world
knew
i
could
count
on
you
this
is
what
we
know
some
sixty
years
ago
a
very
old
very
powerful
vampire
came
to
this
shore
not
just
to
feed
he
came
'cause
this
town's
a
mystical
who's
it
yes
the
spanish
who
first
settled
here
called
it
'boca
del
inferno'
roughly
translated
'hellmouth'
it's
a
sort
of
um
portal
between
this
reality
and
the
next
this
vampire
hopes
to
open
it
bring
the
demons
back
end
of
the
world
but
he
blew
it
or
i
mean
there
was
an
earthquake
that
swallowed
half
the
town
and
him
too
you
see
opening
dimensional
portals
is
a
tricky
business
odds
are
he
got
himself
stuck
rather
like
a
uh
cork
in
a
bottle
and
this
harvest
thing
is
to
get
him
out
it
comes
once
in
a
century
on
this
night
the
master
can
draw
power
from
one
of
his
minions
while
it
feeds
enough
power
to
break
free
and
open
the
portal
the
minion
is
called
the
vessel
and
he
bears
this
symbol
so
i
dust
anyone
sporting
that
symbol
and
no
harvest
simply
put
yes
any
idea
where
this
little
gettogether
is
being
held
there
there
are
a
number
of
possibilities
they're
goin'
to
the
bronze
are
you
sure
come
on
all
those
tasty
young
morsels
all
over
the
place
anyway
that's
where
jesse's
gonna
be
trust
me
then
we
should
get
there

sun

i
always
wanted
to
kill
a
slayer
one
at
a
time
quickly
quickly
we're
going
to
have
to
open
the
front
as
well
jesse
i
know
there's
still
a
part
of
you
in
there
okay
let's
deal
with
this
jesse
was
an
excruciating
loser
who
couldn't
get
a
date
with
anyone
in
the
sighted
community
look
at
me
i'm
a
new
man
master
taste
of
this
and
be
free
how'd
it
taste
get
off
of
him
ooo
alright
put
me
out
of
my
misery
you
don't
have
the
guts
you
forget
metal
can't
hurt
me
there's
something
you
forgot
about
too
sunrise
it's
in
about
nine
hours
moron
noooooooo
noooooooo
she
did
it
i'll
be
damned
i
take
it
it's
over
did
we
win
well
we
averted
the
apocalypse
i
give
us
points
for
that
one
thing's
for
sure
nothing's
ever
gonna
be
the
same
well
i
heard
it
was
rival
gangs
you
know
fighting
for
turf
but
all
i
can
tell
you
is
they
were
an
ugly
way
of
looking
and
buffy
like
knew
them
which
is
just
too
weird
i
mean
i
don't
even
remember
that
much
but
i'm
telling
you
it
was
a
freak
show
oh
i
wish
i'd
been
there
you
should
have
been
there
it
was
so
creepy
what
exactly
were
you
expecting
i
don't
know
something
i
mean
the
dead
rose
we
should
at
least
have
an
assembly
people
have
a
tendency
to
rationalize
what
they
can
and
forget
what
they
can't
believe
me
i've
seen
it
happen
well
i'll
never
forget
it
none
of
it
good
next
time
you'll
be
prepared
next
time
next
time
is
why
we've
prevented
the
master
from
freeing
himself
and
opening
the
mouth
of
hell
that's
not
to
say
he's
going
to
stop
trying
i'd
say
the
fun
is
just
beginning
more
vampires
not
just
vampires
the
next
threat
we
face
may
be
something
quite
different
i
can
hardly
wait
we're
at
the
center
of
a
mystical
convergence
here
we
may
in
fact
stand
between
the
earth
and
its
total
destruction
well
i
gotta
look
on
the
bright
side
maybe
i
can
still
get
kicked
out
of
school
oh
yeah
that's
a
plan
'cause
lots
of
schools
aren't
on
hellmouths
maybe
you
could
blow
something
up
they're
really
strict
about
that
i
was
thinking
of
a
more
subtle
approach
y'know
like
excessive
not
studying
the
earth
is
doomed
