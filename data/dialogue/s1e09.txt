i
will
be
whole
i
will
be
new
learning
to
love
yourself
is
the
greatest
love
of
all
i
decided
long
ago
never
to
walk
in
anyone's
shadow
if
i
fail
if
i
succeed
at
least
thank
you
cordelia
thathat's
going
to
be
lovely
but
i
didn't
do
the
part
with
the
sparklers
um
wwe'll
um
save
that
for
the
dress
rehearsal
uh
lisa
please
uhhh
if
it
isn't
the
great
producer
had
to
see
this
to
believe
it
oh
you
three
the
school
talent
show
how
ever
did
you
finagle
such
a
primo
assignment
our
new
f√£hrer
mr
snyder
i
think
they
call
'em
'principals'
now
mm
he
thought
it
would
behoove
me
to
have
more
contact
with
the
students
i
did
try
to
explain
that
my
vocational
choice
of
librarian
was
a
deliberate
attempt
to
minimize
said
contact
but
uh
he
would
have
none
of
it
giles
unto
every
generation
is
born
one
who
must
run
the
annual
talentless
show
you
cannot
escape
your
destiny
if
you
had
any
shred
of
decency
you
would
have
participated
or
at
least
um
helped
nah
i
think
i'll
take
on
your
traditional
role
and
watch
and
mock
and
laugh
okay
i
think
maybe
we
better
leave
our
mr
giles
to
this
business
he
calls
a
show
principal
snyder
so
we
think
school
events
are
stupid
and
we
think
authority
figures
are
to
be
made
fun
of
no
no
we
don't
wunless
you
do
and
we
think
our
afternoon
classes
are
optional
all
three
of
you
left
campus
yesterday
yeah
but
we
were
fighting
a
demon
fighting
not
fighting
no
we
uh
left
to
avoid
fighting
real
antisocial
types
you
need
to
integrate
into
this
school
people
i
think
i
just
found
three
eager
new
participants
for
the
talent
show
what
no
please
i've
been
watching
you
three
always
getting
into
one
scrape
or
another
well
we're
really
really
sorry
but
about
the
talent
show
pleeease
you
can't
make
us
my
predecessor
mr
flutie
may
have
gone
in
for
all
that
touchyfeely
relating
nonsense
but
he
was
eaten
you're
in
my
world
now
and
sunnydale
has
touched
and
felt
for
the
last
time
can
i
just
mention
that
detention
is
a
timehonored
form
of
punishment
i
know
the
three
of
you
will
come
up
with
a
wonderful
act
for
the
school
to
watch
and
mock
and
laugh
at
no
thank
you
ewww
dummy
dyow
mime
i
think
dummies
are
cute
you
don't
uuuhhh
they
give
me
the
wig
ever
since
i
was
little
what
happened
i
saw
a
dummy
it
gave
me
the
wig
there
really
wasn't
a
story
there
hi
i'm
morgan
and
i'm
sid
hey
morgan
would
you
like
to
tell
some
jokes
would
i
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
it's
also
a
wood
nose
and
a
wood
mouth
i
didn't
sleep
at
all
last
night
alright
time
out
let's
stop
this
before
someone
gets
hurt
kid
you
are
the
worst
even
i
can
see
your
lips
move
c'mon
sid
you're
spoiling
my
act
i
worked
on
these
jokes
for
weeks
you
call
those
jokes
my
jockey
shorts
are
made
out
of
better
material
and
they're
edible
there
you
see
i'm
sure
you
three
can
come
up
with
something
is
anybody
there
hello
hello
i
will
be
flesh
i
reach
into
the
hat
and
out
comes
has
anybody
seen
a
rabbit
i
can't
do
this
xander
come
on
i
i
can't
i
have
my
pride
okay
i
don't
have
a
lot
of
my
pride
but
i
have
enough
so
that
i
can't
do
this
a
dramatic
scene
is
the
easiest
way
to
get
through
the
talent
show
because
it
doesn't
require
an
actual
talent
but
we
have
talent
we
can
do
stuff
buffy
uh
what
am
i
gonna
do
slay
vampires
on
stage
maybe
in
a
funny
way
willow
you
can
do
stuff
uh
the
piano
you
play
a
little
well
that's
cool
you
can
accompany
us
and
we
can
attempt
to
sing
oh
iin
front
of
other
people
then
no
i
don't
play
whatever
happened
to
corporal
punishment
mm
mm
mm
look
at
the
goodies
morgan
you're
really
getting
good
where
did
you
come
up
with
that
voice
it's
kind
of
an
imitation
of
my
dad
sounds
real
it
is
real
i'm
the
one
with
the
talent
here
the
kid's
dead
weight
how
about
you
and
i
do
a
little
rehearsin'
on
our
own
honey
uh
hey
you
know
what
they
say
once
you
go
wood
nothin's
as
good
okay
morgan
we
get
the
joke
horny
dummy
ha
ha
it's
very
funny
but
you
might
wanna
consider
getting
some
new
shtick
unless
you
want
your
prop
ending
up
as
a
duraflame
log
kids
today
need
discipline
that's
an
unpopular
word
these
days
'discipline'
i
know
principal
flutie
would
have
said
'kids
need
understanding
kids
are
human
beings'
that's
the
kind
of
woollyheaded
liberal
thinking
that
leads
to
being
eaten
i
i
think
perhaps
it
was
a
little
more
complex
than
um
this
place
has
quite
a
reputation
suicide
missing
persons
spontaneous
cheerleader
combustion
you
can't
put
up
with
that
you've
gotta
keep
an
eye
on
the
bad
element
like
those
three
kids
i
don't
like
them
from
now
on
you're
gonna
see
a
very
different
sunnydale
high
tight
ship
clean
orderly
and
quiet
it
was
emily
emily
dancer
emily
oh
man
i
hate
this
school
uh
it
must
have
happened
just
after
uh
dress
rehearsals
there
was
a
crosscountry
meet
at
melville
she
she
she
never
showed
up
for
it
vampire
um
i
think
not
giles
share
what
happened
her
heart
was
removed
yikes
does
that
mean
anything
to
you
besides
ooooooo
uh
there
are
various
demons
which
which
feed
off
human
hearts
but
but
demons
have
claws
and
teeth
they
got
no
use
for
a
big
old
knife
which
more
than
likely
makes
our
murderer
human
did
i
mention
that
i
hate
this
school
so
emily
was
killed
by
a
regular
human
person
the
evidence
certainly
points
that
way
no
wait
ii'm
not
buying
you
guys
remember
the
hellmouth
mystical
activity
is
totally
rife
here
this
to
me
says
demon
i'd
like
to
think
you're
right
a
demon
is
a
creature
of
evil
pure
and
very
simple
a
person
driven
to
kill
is
is
um
it's
more
complex
the
creep
factor
is
also
heightened
it
could
be
anyone
it
could
be
me
it's
not
though
uh
demon
or
no
we
have
some
investigating
to
do
i
suggest
we
start
with
your
your
talent
show
compatriots
one
of
them
may
have
been
the
last
to
see
her
alive
i
didn't
know
her
too
well
there's
that
whole
dancerband
rivalry
y'know
i've
heard
about
that
but
i
did
speak
to
her
a
little
the
day
that
yesterday
how
did
she
seem
she
was
happy
i
guess
she
was
psyched
to
be
doing
the
show
she
was
a
really
good
dancer
here
pick
a
card
uh
um
no
waiwaiwaiwait
not
that
one
pick
this
one
do
you
remember
the
last
time
you
saw
her
she
was
talkin'
to
someone
who
that
smart
guy
the
one
with
the
dummy
what's
his
name
morgan
yeah
that's
it
he
was
actin'
kinda
strange
strange
how
it's
just
such
a
tragedy
for
me
emma
was
like
my
best
friend
emily
well
morgan's
just
strange
he's
always
rubbing
his
head
a
lot
and
moaning
especially
the
other
day
he
seemed
kinda
paranoid
lookin'
around
at
everyone
and
i
think
i
saw
him
arguing
with
his
dummy
all
i
can
think
is
it
coulda
been
me
we
can
dream
right
now
you
and
me
gotta
be
on
the
lookout
figure
out
who's
gonna
be
next
how
are
we
supposed
to
oh
hi
hello
i
was
just
working
on
throwing
my
voice
uh
morgan
did
you
notice
anything
weird
going
on
around
here
yesterday
weird
what
d'you
mean
with
emily
did
she
say
anything
to
you
was
she
arguing
with
anyone
no
she
was
dancing
sid
and
i
were
talking
talking
rehearsing
so
you
didn't
notice
anything
weird
at
ohhh
morgan
are
you
okay
look
sweetheart
he
answered
your
question
now
leave
him
alone
okay
morgan
how
'bout
talking
to
me
yourself
now
he
said
all
he's
gonna
say
it's
okay
sid
we're
done
i'm
sorry
look
i
didn't
mean
to
make
you
mad
no
i'm
it's
him
he's
we
have
to
go
cute
couple
okay
next
time
we
split
up
someone
else
is
on
cordy
detail
five
more
minutes
with
her
and
we
woulda
had
another
organ
donor
i
think
i
had
a
bit
more
luck
everyone
i
talked
to
seemed
to
point
their
fingers
at
the
same
person
morgan
morgan
we
have
a
winner
i
fear
i
was
led
to
the
same
conclusion
well
what
do
we
do
we
don't
slay
him
right
we
wanna
bring
him
to
justice
we
could
set
up
a
complex
sting
operation
where
we
get
him
to
confess
uh
i
should
wear
a
wire
whoa
hey
you
guys
all
we
know
is
that
morgan
is
a
grade
a
large
weirdo
that
doesn't
lead
directly
to
murderer
guy
talks
to
his
puppet
and
for
his
puppet
well
yeah
but
what
about
the
whole
'it's
a
demon'
theory
i'm
looking
into
that
but
uh
my
investigation
is
somewhat
hampered
by
our
life
in
the
theater
uh
priority
check
giles
yeah
we
can't
do
the
talent
show
it's
unthinkable
i'm
not
able
to
think
it
principal
snyder
is
watching
us
all
very
closely
now
if
he
chooses
he
can
make
all
our
lives
extremely
difficult
a
slayer
cannot
afford
that
we
will
find
this
murderer
but
in
the
meantime
the
show
must
go
on
this
is
so
unfair
buffy
you
uh
watch
morgan
check
his
locker
see
if
there's
anything
there
like
a
heart
or
something
alright
i'll
pull
up
his
locker
number
can
i
still
wear
a
wire
okay
two
to
the
left
three
to
the
right
principal
snyder
what
are
you
doing
uh
looking
for
something
school
hours
are
over
you
therefore
should
be
gone
and
i'm
going
any
minute
now
there
are
things
i
will
not
tolerate
students
loitering
on
campus
after
school
horrible
murders
with
hearts
being
removed
and
also
smoking
well
i
don't
do
any
of
those
things
not
ever
there's
something
going
on
with
you
i'll
figure
it
out
sooner
or
later
do
you
need
something
here
oh
yeah
right
um
a
friend
wanted
me
to
get
something
out
of
his
case
he
must've
taken
it
and
just
forgotten
to
tell
me
mmhmm
get
along
home
now
it's
late
no
i
can't
do
it
it's
the
only
way
i
don't
want
she's
the
one
but
you
saw
what
she
did
how
strong
she
is
i
know
but
she's
the
last
just
this
one
more
and
i'll
be
free
i
won't
i
will
hi
hon
how's
it
uh
going
with
the
talent
show
it'll
be
over
soon
it
can't
be
that
bad
i
for
one
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
your
act
seeing
iin
the
sense
of
actually
attending
of
course
uhuh
no
mom
yyyou
can't
and
i
mean
if
i
know
you're
out
there
watching
i'll
freeze
up
stage
fright
but
i
wanna
support
what
you're
doing
look
mom

you
really
love
me
and
wanna
show
your
support

stay
away
far
away
honey

there
uh

there
something
bothering
you
ii
mean
besides
your
fabulous
debut
nothing
there's
just
a
lot
going
on
right
now
well
get
some
sleep
you'll
feel
better
in
the
morning
good
plan
honey
what
is
it
in
the
bed
in
the
covers
there's
something
where
there's
something
there
well
well
there
there's
nothing
there
now
are
are
you
sure
you
didn't
have
a
nightmare
no
there's
some
there
is
yeah
you're
probably
right
i'm
sorry
i
got
you
up
don't
worry
about
it
i
was
dreaming
about
bills
sweetheart
you
shouldn't
go
to
sleep
with
the
window
open
i
didn't
and
my
lovely
assistant
steps
into
the
box
and
behold
you
were
supposed
to
leave
i
don't
understand
why
i
why
i
have
to
follow
brett
and
his
stupid
band
because
we
have
to
clear
their
equipment
before
the
finale
i
told
you
but
the
mood
it'll
be
all
wrong
my
song
is
about
dignity
and
human
feelings
and
personal
hygiene
or
something
anyway
it's
sappy
and
no
one
is
gonna
be
feeling
sappy
after
all
that
rock
and
roll
uhhh
what
oh
i'm
sorry
um
your
hair
uh
there's
something
wrong
with
my
hair
ohmigod
xander
was
right
it
worked
like
a
charm
hello
you
look
a
bit
worse
for
uh
what
exactly
are
you
the
worse
for
where's
morgan
uh
i
i
haven't
seen
him
did
he
do
something
to
you
no
it
was
his
sid
the
dummy
okay
everyone
look
at
me
like
i'm
in
a
bunny
suit
'cause
that's
how
stupid
i
feel
saying
this
i
think
sid
was
in
my
room
last
night
with
morgan
no
he
was
alone
and
alive
did
you
see
him
well
i
saw
something
iit
ran
across
my
floor
under
my
bed
and
then
it
attacked
me
attacked
you
how
it
was
like
it
pounced
on
my
face
like
a
cat
yeah
exactly
but
when
i
turned
the
lights
on
it
was
already
gone
ii
think
it
went
out
my
window
like
a
cat
yeah
no
it
was
sid
the
dummy
or
possibly
the
nightmare
of
somebody
who
had
dummies
on
her
mind
you
did
say
they
creep
you
out
excuse
me
can
i
have
a
little
support
here
please
i'm
not
just
some
crazy
person
i'm
the
slayer
the
dummy
slayer
there's
nothing
funny
about
that
well
on
the
side
of
the
'morgan's
just
crazy'
theory
there
is
well
morgan
i'd
like
to
see
morgan
without
his
better
half
for
a
few
minutes
bet
he
could
tell
me
something
oh
uh
iif
it's
any
consolation
i
i
may
have
found
a
possible
demon
culprit
thethere's
a
reference
in
here
to
a
brotherhood
of
seven
demons
who
take
uh
the
form
of
young
humans
every
seven
years
these
demons
need
human
organs
aaa
brain
and
a
heart
to
maintain
their
humanity
otherwise
they
they
they
revert
back
to
their
original
form
which
is
uh
uh
slightly
less
appealing
so
morgan
could
still
be
the
guy
only
demon
morgan
instead
of
crazy
morgan
it's
said
that
these
demons
are
are
are
preternaturally
strong
and
and
and
morgan
is
is
well
he
seems
to
be
getting
weaker
every
day
it
was
as
a
result
of
this
that
president
monroe
put
forth
the
eponymous
meaning
named
after
one's
self
monroe
doctrine
which
in
one
sense
established
the
us
as
a
local
peacekeeper
looks
like
someone
digs
you
that's
adorable
you
and
the
dummy
could
tour
in
the
freak
show
okay
who
can
tell
me
how
spain
responded
to
this
policy
morgan
morgan
what
morgan
has
other
things
on
his
mind
give
me
your
puppet
i'll
put
him
away
you'll
get
it
back
after
school
okay
then
in
the
first
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
i'm
still
watchin'
you
morgan
that
is
enough
mrs
jackson
morgan
you
said
you'd
give
me
oh
of
course
y'know
i
wanted
to
ask
you
is
everything
okay
at
home
here
at
school
yeah
it's
great
i
feel
like
you've
become
a
little
detached
mm
you're
one
of
the
brightest
kids
i've
seen
in
a
long
time
but
lately
it
seems
like
you're
not
all
there
try
not
to
let
other
things
get
in
the
way
okay
can
i
get
sid
now
sure
it's
gone
gone
whadaya
mean

some
hunting
of
our
own
to
do
once
again
i'm
banished
to
the
demon
section
of
the
card
catalog
you
concentrate
on
reanimation
theory
i'll
peck
about
in
organ
harvesting
unless
of
course
you
prefer
that's
okay
you
can
have
the
organs

just
you

me
huh

looks
more
comfortable
morgan
morgan
principal
snyder
looking
for
something
have
you
seen
morgan
shay
you
know
with
everything
that's
been
going
on
recently
i'm
not
sure
how
safe
it
is
for
a
girl
like
yourself
to
be
here
alone
well
i
was
just
leaving
and
i
know
how
to
take
care
of
myself
alright
then
look
what
i
found
in
the
section
on
toys
and
magic
'on
rare
occasions
inanimate
objects
of
human
quality
such
as
dolls
and
mannequins
already
mystically
possessed
of
consciousness
have
acted
upon
their
desire
to
become
human
by
harvesting
organs'
giles
emily's
heart
morgan's
dummy
mm
whoa
what
is
it
he's
gone
sid's
gone
what
oh
uhhh
morgan
morgan
demon's
got
himself
a
brain
who's
ever
out
there
i'm
gonna
hurt
you
badly
if
you'll
just
gimme
a
minute
you
win
now
you
can
take
your
heart
and
your
brain
and
move
on
i'm
sure
they
would
have
made
great
trophies
for
your
case
that
woulda
been
justice
yeah
except
for
one
thing
you
lost
and
now
you'll
never
be
human
yeah
well
neither
will
you
what
this
is
what
i
do
i
hunt
demons
yeah
you
wouldn't
know
it
to
look
at
me
let's
just
say
there
was
me
there
was
a
really
mean
demon
there
was
a
curse
and
the
next
thing
i
know
i'm
not
me
anymore
i'm
sitting
on
some
guy's
knee
with
his
hand
up
my
shirt
and
ever
since
then
you've
been
a
living
dummy
the
kid
here
was
right
all
along
i
shoulda
picked
you
to
team
up
with
but
i
didn't
because
because
you
thought
i
was
the
demon
who
can
blame
me
for
thinking
look
at
you
you're
strong
athletic
limber
nubile
i'm
back
in
any
case
now
that
this
demon's
got
the
heart
and
brain
he
gets
to
keep
the
human
form
he's
in
for
another
seven
years
i
must
say
it's
a
welcome
change
to
have
someone
else
explain
all
these
things
there
were
seven
of
these
guys
i've
killed
six
if
i
can
get
the
last
one
the
curse
will
be
lifted
and
i'll
be
free
i'm
sure
it's
someone
in
that
stupid
talent
show
yeah
but
now
that
demon
has
what
he
wants
he'll
be
moving
on
so
once
we
know
who's
missing
from
the
show
we'll
know
who
our
demon
is
the
show
what
it's
gonna
start
i'm
supposed
to
be
there
okay
um
start
pulling
everyone's
addresses
in
the
talent
show
iif
they're
not
there
maybe
we
can
catch
them
at
home
and
you
get
'em
all
on
stage
form
the
power
circle
then
we
can
see
who's
a
noshow
um
uh
the
what
the
power
circle
you
get
everyone
together
you
get
'em
you
know
revved
up
right
how'd
he
ever
get
that
gig
fifteen
minutes
to
curtain
everyone
uh
fifteen
minutes
i
i
can't
go
out
there
all
those
people
staring
at
me
and
judging
me
like
i'm
some
kind
of
buffy
what
if
i
mess
up
cordelia
there
uh
therethere's
uh
uh
an
adage
uh
that
uh
if
you're
feeling
nervous
then
uh
you
should
imagine
the
entire
audience
are
in
their
underwear
eww
even
mrs
franklin
uhhh
perhaps
not
yeah
um
alright
um
we'll
assemble
on
the
stage
in
five
minutes
for
the
um
uh
power
thing
so
what's
your
deal
kid
i
don't
figure
you
for
a
demon
hunter
i'm
a
vampire
slayer
you
you're
the
slayer
damn
i
knew
a
slayer
in
the
30's
korean
chick
very
hot
we're
talking
muscle
tone
man
we
had
some
times
hey
that
was
pre
dummy
alright
now
i
was
a
guy
so
you
kill
the
demon
and
the
curse
is
lifted
right
that's
the
drill
you
don't
actually
turn
into
a
prince
do
you
ii
mean
your
body
is
dust
and
bones
when
i
say
free
you
mean
dead
don't
get
sniffly
on
me
sis
i've
lived
a
lot
longer
than
most
demon
hunters
or
slayers
for
that
matter
of
course
if
you
want
to
snuggle
up
and
comfort
me
so
that
horny
dummy
thing
really
isn't
an
act
is
it
nope
yuk
iis
everybody
here
okay
here
comes
our
lineup
quickly
everyone
uh
um
power
circle
well
that's
that
then
um
everybody
uh
get
ready
hold
on
no
one's
missing
so
the
demon
isn't
in
the
show
it
seems
not
uh
tell
the
others
look
it's
nearly
curtain
i
must
get
the
show
rolling
right
right
sid
sid
i'm
never
gonna
stop
washing
my
hands
so
the
dummy
tells
us
that
he's
a
demon
hunter
and
we're
like
fine
la
la
la
la
he
takes
off
and
now
there's
a
brain
does
anybody
else
feel
like
they've
been
keyser
soze'd
sid's
on
the
level
i'm
sure
of
it
but
why
would
the
demon
have
rejected
the
brain
ii
mean
i
thought
morgan
was
the
smartest
kid
in
school
he
was
look
at
his
grades
all
a's
he
was
even
taking
college
classes
wait
a
second
what
all
these
sick
days
he
was
off
for
like
half
the
year
check
the
school
nurse's
file
look
at
this
'in
case
of
emergency
contact
dr
dale
leggett
california
institute
of
neurosurgery
cancer
ward'
xander
brain
cancer
that's
why
he
had
all
the
headaches
this
means
that
whatever's
out
there
still
needs
a
healthy
intelligent
brain
in
other
words
i'm
safe
and
it's
gonna
be
looking
for
the
smartest
person
around
what
yes
if
you
you
calibrated
the
units
of
weight
then
you
could
calculate
the
uh
specific
maximum
velocity
achieved
before
the
point
of
impact
gee
mr
giles
you're
really
smart
could
you
do
me
a
favor
what
could
a
demon
possibly
want
from
me
what's
the
square
root
of
841
29
oh
yeah
don't
worry
willow
as
long
as
you're
with
us
there's
absolutely
no
way
that
demon
is
gonna
get
what
he
wants
oh
my
pretty
cool
huh
are
you
sure
there's
no
one
else
who
could
help
you
out
my
assistant
got
sick
you
won't
have
to
say
anything
i'll
i'll
show
you
lie
down
uh
uh
how
how
exactly
does
it
work
a
good
magician
never
tells
his
secrets
c'mon
we
haven't
got
much
time
this
is
ridiculous
we
can't
just
sit
here
and
wait
for
him
to
come
to
us
we
have
to
figure
out
who
we're
dealing
with
i
still
vote
dummy
no
okay
so
we
ruled
out
all
the
people
in
the
talent
show
that's
because
they
were
all
there
but
that's
before
we
found
the
brain
right
so
it
probably
is
one
of
them
and
and
giles
doesn't
know
he's
with
them
all
right
now
uch
giles
can
handle
himself

mean
he
is
really
smart
giles
shshshouldn't
it
be
aimed
at
my
neck
no

this
way
your
scalp
gets
sliced
off

pouring
out
