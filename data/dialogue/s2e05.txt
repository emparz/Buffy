is
she
dying
i
think
she's
singing
to
a
telephone
in
hindi
now
that's
entertainment
why
is
she
singing
she's
sad
because
her
lover
gave
her
twelve
gold
coins
but
then
the
wizard
cut
open
the
bag
of
salt
and
now
the
dancing
minions
have
nowhere
to
put
their
big
maypole
fish
thing
uhhuh
why
is
she
singing
her
lover
i
thought
that
was
her
chiropractor
because
of
that
thing
he
did
with
her
feet
no
that
was
personal
hmm
and
we
thought
just
because
we
didn't
have
any
money
or
anyplace
to
go
this
would
be
a
lackluster
evening
i
know
we
could
go
to
the
bronze
and
sneak
in
our
own
tea
bags
and
ask
for
hot
water
hop
off
the
outlaw
train
will
before
you
land
us
all
in
jail
i
for
one
am
giddy
and
up
there's
a
kinda
hush
all
over
sunnydale
no
demons
or
vampires
to
slay
i'm
here
with
my
friends
so
how
does
the
water
buffalo
fit
in
again
callie
callie
where're
you
going
the
party's
just
getting
started
see
dr
debi
says
when
a
man
is
speaking
you
make
serious
eye
contact
and
you
really
really
listen
and
you
laugh
at
everything
he
says
you
dreamed
about
angel
again
third
night
in
a
row
what
did
he
do
in
the
dream
stuff
oh
stuff
was
it
one
of
those
vivid
dreams
where
you
could
feel
his
lips
and
smell
his
hair
it
had
surround
sound
i'm
just
thinking
about
him
so
much
lately
you
two
are
so
right
for
each
other
except
for
the
uh
vampire
thing
that
doesn't
make
him
a
bad
person
necessarily
i'm
brainsick
i
can't
have
a
relationship
with
him
not
during
the
day
but
you
could
ask
him
for
coffee
some
night
it's
the
nonrelationship
drink
of
choice
it's
not
a
date
it's
a
caffeinated
beverage
okay
sure
it's
hot
and
bitter
like
a
relationship
that
way
but
what's
like
a
relationship
nothing
i
have
coffee
huh
there's
really
no
comparison
between
college
men
and
high
school
boys
i
mean
look
at
that
so
cor
you're
datin'
college
guys
now
well
not
that
it's
any
of
your
business
but
i
happen
to
be
dating
a
delta
zeta
kappa
oh
an
extraterrestrial
so
that's
how
you
get
a
date
after
you
exhausted
all
the
human
guys
you'll
go
to
college
someday
xander
i
just
know
your
pizza
delivery
career
will
take
you
so
many
exciting
places
oh
i
told
giles
i'd
meet
him
in
the
library
ten
minutes
ago
aw
he
won't
be
upset
there
hasn't
been
much
paranormal
activity
lately
just
because
the
paranormal
is
more
normal
and
less
para
of
late
is
no
excuse
for
tardiness
or
letting
your
guard
down
i
haven't
let
my
guard
down
oh
really
you
yawned
your
way
through
weapons
training
last
week
you
you
you
you
skipped
handtohand
entirely
are
you
gonna
be
prepared
if
a
demon
springs
up
behind
you
and
does
this
yeah
well
i'm
i'm
not
a
demon
which
is
why
you
should
let
go
now
thank
you
when
you
live
on
top
of
a
a
mystical
convergence
it's
only
a
matter
of
time
before
a
fresh
hell
breaks
loose
now
is
the
time
that
you
should
train
more
strictly
you
should
hunt
and
patrol
more
keenly
you
should
hone
your
skills
day
and
night
and
the
little
slice
of
life
that
still
belongs
to
me
from
i
don't
know
seven
to
sevenohfive
in
the
morning
can
i
do

fuzzy
feelings
towards
one
uh
digging
on
the
undead
doesn't
exactly
do
wonders

your
social

you
hate
these
guys
yeah
with
their
charmed
lives
and
their
movie
star
good
looks
and
more
money
than
you
can
count
i'm
hating
i'm
going
to
attack
you
a
word
of
warning
for
your
own
good
i
won't
be
pulling
any
punches
please
don't
good
so
um
you're
on
patrol
and
uh
i'll
see
you
in
the
morning
there's
blood
on
it
hi
it's
nice
to
blood
i
can
smell
it
oh
it's
pretty
thin
it
probably
belonged
to
a
girl
probably
ii
was
just
thinking
wouldn't
it
be
funny
some
time
to
see
each
other
when
it
wasn't
a
blood
thing
what
are
you
sayin'
you
wanna
have
a
date
no
you
don't
wanna
have
a
date
who
said
'date'
iii
never
said
'date'
right
you
just
wanna
have
coffee
or
somethin'
coffee
i
knew
this
was
gonna
happen
what
what
do
you
think
is
happening
you're
sixteen
years
old
i'm
two
hundred
and
fortyone
i've
done
the
math
you
don't
know
what
you're
doing
you
don't
know
what
you
want
oh
no
i
i
think
i
do
i
want
out
of
this
conversation
listen
if
we
date
you
and
i
both
know
one
thing's
gonna
lead
to
another
one
thing
already
has
led
to
another
you
think
it's
a
little
late
to
be
reading
me
a
warning
label
i'm
just
tryin'
to
protect
you
this
could
get
outta
control
isn't
that
the
way
it's
supposed
to
be
this
isn't
some
fairy
tale
when
i
kiss
you
you
don't
wake
up
from
a
deep
sleep
and
live
happily
ever
after
no
when
you
kiss
me

wanna
die

respect
you
too
much

really
isn't
the
point
here
is
it
the
zeta
kappas
have
to
have
a
certain
balance
at
their
party
and
richard
explained
it
all
to
me
but
i
was
so
busy
really
listening
that
i
didn't
hear
much
anyway
the
deal
is
they
need
you
to
go
and
if
you
don't
go
i
can't
i'll
go
you'll
go
great
i'll
drive

it's
complicated
if

bends
then
she
breaks
you're
big
on
responsibility
i
like
that
but
there's
such
a
thing
as
being
too
mature
she
loves
you

then
she
takes
it
away
you
should
relax
enjoy
yourself
once
in
a
while
she
bends
and
she
bows
you
think
i'm
too
mature
i
talk
too
much
have
you
picked
up
on

she
melts
like
snow
anyway
the

you
don't
have
to
dance
with
me
she
bends
she
breaks
he
might
come
back
she
hates
you
but
then
she
makes
a
mistake
confused
and
a
lot
to
take
and
where
to
fall
out
