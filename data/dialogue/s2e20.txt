all
i'm
saying
is
it's
a
stupid
idea
to
have
a
victory
party
at
the
beach
it's
officially
nippy
so
say
my
nips
i
think
it's
festive
a
party
with
nature
well
it's
the
team's
choice
it
was
their
victory
team
swim
team
hardly
what
i'd
call
a
team
the
yankees
abbott
and
costello
the
'a'
now
those
were
teams
jealous
no
yyes
but
'no'
more
than
'yes'
i
mean
look
at
that
dodd
mcalvy
last
month
he's
the
freak
with
jicama
breath
who
waxes
his
back
he
wins
a
few
meets
and
suddenly
inherits
the
cool
gene
well
all
i
know
is
my
cheerleading
squad
wasted
a
lot
of
pep
on
losers
it's
about
time
our
school
excelled
at
something
hmm
you're
forgetting
our
high
mortality
rate
we're
number
one
huh
beautiful
isn't
it
yeah
it's
just
so
eternal
a
true
mother
giving
birth
to
new
life

adaptable
and
nurturing

like
solitaire
with
naked
ladies
on
the
cards
what's
your
point
no
point
nice
work
in
yesterday's
meet
son
now
let's
go
for
it
uh
hi
there
sir
rosenberg
how's
the
class
everything
in
order
well
actually
great
i've
been
talking
to
the
board
we've
been
having
trouble
finding
a
competent
teacher
this
late
in
the
term
do
you
think
you
could
continue
subbing
through
finals
oh
sure
i
like
teaching
isn't
that
nice
you're
a
team
player
and
i
like
that
a
team
player
wants
everyone
on
the
team
to
succeed
wants
everyone
to
pass
well
yeah
sure
i
understand
there's
a
problem
with
gage
petronzi
oh
good
then
you
know
well
yeah
besides
the
behavior
problem
he
won't
do
homework
and
his
test
scores
are
well
actually
he
doesn't
have
any
test
scores
because
he
never
shows
up
when
we
have
i'm
not
interested
in
any
of
that
i'm
interested
in
why
when
this
school
is
on
the
brink
of
winning
its
first
state
championship
in
fifteen
years
you
slap
a
crucial
member
of
that
team
with
a
failing
mark
that
would
force
his
removal
is
that
how
you
show
your
school
spirit
yes
well
i
mean
no
i'm
just
trying
to
grade
fairly
gage
is
a
champion
he's
under
more
pressure
than
the
other
students
and
i
think
we
need
to
cut
him
some
slack
you're
asking
me
to
change
his
grade
i
never
said
any
such
thing
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
you
recheck
your
figures
and
i
think
we'll
find
a
grade
more
fitting
to
an
athlete
of
gage's
stature
just
like
that
he
actually
told
you
to
alter
his
grade
exactly
except
for
actually
telling
me
to
but
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
of
what
he
wasn't
telling
me
that
is
wrong
a
big
fat
spanking
wrong
it's
a
slap
in
the
face
to
every
one
of
us
who
studied
hard
and
worked
long
hours
to
earn
xander
i
know
you
take
pride
in
being
the
voice
of
the
common
wuss
but
the
truth
is
certain
people
are
entitled
to
special
privileges
they're
called
winners
that's
the
way
the
world
works
and
what
about
that
nutty
'all
men
are
created
equal'
thing
propaganda
spouted
out
by
the
ugly
and
less
deserving
i
think
that
was
lincoln
disgusting
mole
and
stupid
hat
actually
it
was
jefferson
kept
slaves
remember
you
know
what
really
grates
my
cheese
that
buffy's
not
here
to
share
my
moral
outrage
about
swim
team
perks
she's
too
busy
being
one
of
them
i
don't
know
a
dolphin
a
dolphin
in
the
ocean
because
you
know
when
i'm
in
the
vastness
of
the
ocean
it's
it's
like
i'm
never
alone
you
ever
hear
of
a
woman
named
gertrude
ederle
no
no
i
can't
say
that
i
have
cam
first
woman
to
swim
the
english
channel
same
thing
i
mean
she
would
talk
to
it
i
mean
she'd
carry
on
entire
conversations
with
it
sometimes
i
do
that
i
mean
once
i
was
out
in
you
know
what
cam
thanks
i'd
forgotten
how
nice
it
is
to
just
talk
or
in
my
case
listen
without
any
romantic
pressure
hey
i'm
not
about
pressure
i
just
want
you
to
be
comfortable
i'm
comfy
i'm
so
comfy
i'm
nodding
off
actually
which
is
why
are
you
wearing
a
bra
what
come
on
i
mean
tell
me
you
haven't
been
thinking
about
this
ever
since
last
night
what
i'm
thinking
about
is
that
i
should
probably
get
out
of
this
car
relax
i'm
not
gonna
hurt
you
oh
it's
not
me
i'm
worried
about
you
like
it
rough
ow
oh
oh
ah
oh
you
broke
my
nose
ah
ow
i
wasn't
the
attacker
principal
snyder
i
was
the
attacked
that's
not
how
it
looked
from
where
i
was
standing
i
don't
know
what
happened
i
mean
first
she
leads
me
on
then
she
goes
schizo
on
me
lead
you
on
when
did
i
lead
you
on
oh
come
on
i
mean
look
at
the
way
she
dresses
coach
how
we
doing
cameron
coach
marin
how
bad
does
it
look
well
luckily
it's
not
broken
but
sure
as
hell
it's
gonna
sting
for
a
few
days
i
mean
our
chances
of
winning
the
state
championship
oh
can
we
still
do
it
i'm
gonna
need
cameron
back
at
a
hundred
and
ten
percent
what
happened
to
dodd
that's
none
of
your
concern
you'd
better
hope
that
boy's
nose
heals
before
the
meet
this
friday
walker
i
want
you
to
hit
the
steam
room
as
soon
as
you're
done
here
and
try
to
keep
those
sinuses
clear
take
care
of
my
boy
ruthie
i
always
do
and
you
try
to
dress
more
appropriately
from
now
on
this
isn't
a
dance
club
so
i'm
treated
like
the
baddie
just
because
he
has
a
sprained
wrist
and
a
bloody
nose
and
i
don't
have
a
scratch
on
me
which
granted
hurts
my
case
a
little
on
the
surface
but
meanwhile
he
gets
away
with
it
because
he's
on
the
'aren't
we
the
most'
swim
team
who
by
the
way
if
no
one's
noticed
have
been
acting
like
real
jerks
lately
so
anything
new
with
you
guys
thank
you
for
taking
an
interest
apparently
some
remains
were
found
on
the
beach
this
morning
some
human
remains
dodd
mcalvy's
remains
vampire
no
no
he
was
eviscerated
nothing
left
but
skin
and
cartilage
in
other
words
this
was
no
boating
accident
so
something
ripped
him
open
and
ate
out
his
insides
like
an
oreo
cookie
well
except
for
you
know
without
the
chocolatey
cookie
goodness
yes
um
principal
snyder
has
has
asked
the
faculty
to
keep
the
news
quiet
for
now
um
so
as
not
to
unduly
upset
the
students
for
'students'
read
'swim
team'
so
we're
looking
for
a
beastie
that
uh
eats
humans
whole
except
for
the
skin
this
doesn't
make
any
sense
yeah
the
skin's
the
best
part
any
demons
with
high
cholesterol
you're
gonna
think
about
that
later
mister
and
you're
gonna
laugh
okay
son
i
think
you've
had
enough
time
to
hit
the
shower
too
much
research
need
beverage
hey
watch
it
oh
forgive
me
your
swim
teamliness
loser
likin'
the
nose
cam
good
look
for
you
meaning
what
meaning
buffy
must
not
be
on
your
list
of
privileges
after
all
man
i
love
it
when
you
guys
mess
with
her
you're
lucky
i'm
hungry
oh
the
cafeteria's
closed
not
to
me
god
what
is
that
grape
orange
orange
grape
oh
my
god
no
no
no
the
mouth's
a
lot
bigger
and
downward
like
this
with
more
teeth
i'm
doing
the
best
i
can
is
that
what
you
saw
xander
y
yeah
i
think
so
pretty
much
aaaaare
you
sure
well
it
was
dark
and
the
thing
went
through
the
window
so
quick
and
i
was
a
little
shocked
when
i
saw
it
and
go
ahead
say
it
you
ran
like
a
woman
hey
if
you
saw
this
thing
you'd
run
like
a
woman
too
buffy
was
right
according
to
the
statistics
dodd
and
cameron
were
the
best
swimmers
on
the
team
first
and
second
actually
which
means
if
my
theory's
correct
gage
petronzi
the
thirdbest
swimmer
on
the
team
would
be
the
next
item
on
the
menu
god
this
is
so
sad
we're
never
gonna
win
the
state
championship
i
think
i've
lost
all
will
to
cheerlead
raise
your
hand
if
you
feel
her
pain
if
you're
saying
these
killings
aren't
random
it
would
suggest
someone's
out
for
revenge
and
raise
the
possibility
that
someone
brought
forth
this
sea
monster
from
whence
it
came
to
exact
that
revenge
'from
whence
it
came'
i'm
spending
way
too
much
time
around
you
who
would
hate
the
swim
team
that
much
though
besides
me
i
mean
ooo
willow
jonathon
he
was
bullied
by
dodd
the
other
day
on
the
beach
remember
he
did
say
he
could
take
care
of
things
himself
it's
a
good
call
you
should
question
him
really
me
i'll
crack
him
like
an
egg
meanwhile
i
think
uh
swimmer
number
three
might
benefit
from
your
watchful
eye
and
protection
discreetly
of
course
i'm
on
it
what
about
me
what
can
i
do
well
you
could
go
out
to
the
parking
lot
and
practice
running
like
a
man
so
jonathon
you
tried
out
for
the
swim
team
twice
and
never
made
it
i'm
asthmatic
i
couldn't
keep
up
you
resented
it
didn't
you
maybe
you
hated
being
pushed
around
by
dodd
and
the
others
so
so
you
wanted
revenge
didn't
you
didn't
you
yeah
okay
i
did
so
you
delved
into
the
black
arts
and
conjured
up
a
hellbeast
from
the
ocean's
depths
to
wreak
your
vengeance
huh
didn't
you
what
no
i
snuck
in
yesterday
and
peed
in
the
pool
oh
eww
this
is
such
a
blow
sooner
or
later
the
rest
of
my
boys
are
gonna
find
out
how
can
i
ask
them
to
swim
it's
a
terrible
terrible
tragedy
we
all
feel
your
pain
coach
i
don't
know
two
finer
boys
than
cameron
and
that
other
one
but
i
know
they'd
want
their
friends
to
go
on
and
win
that
state
championship
it's
time
to
think
about
the
team
well
i
don't
have
a
complete
team
as
it
is
if
we
don't
find
someone
by
this
afternoon's
tryouts
we
won't
be
eligible
to
compete
you'll
find
someone
all
he
has
to
do
is
wear
a
bathing
suit
right
if
you'd
listen
we
wouldn't
have
to
go
through
this
gage
takes
a
shot
and
makes
it
he
walks
around
the
table
for
his
next
one
if
you'd
just
let
me
finish
stop
cuttin'
and
jumpin'
ahead
gage
bends
down
and
makes
his
next
shot
yeah
if
you'd
just
shut
your
pretty
mouth
you'd
save
yourself
some
tears
buffy
is
bored
at
the
bar
and
gets
up
she
looks
around
nonchalantly
and
walks
closer
to
the
table
then
gets
behind
a
pillar
and
peeks
out
from
behind
it
at
gage
her
change
of
position
is
not
lost
on
gage
and
he
stiffens
up
frustrated
at
being
watched
so
closely
he
shoots
her
a
look
and
she
quickly
looks
away
gage
has
had
enough
he
puts
down
his
pool
cue
and
walks
around
behind
the
pillar
you
came
back
from
the
bathroom
buffy
peeks
back
at
the
pool
table
and
sees
he's
gone
she
steps
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
pillar
to
look
around
and
practically
runs
into
gage
with
somethin'
on
your
shoe
she
steps
back
over
to
the
pool
table
side
of
the
pillar
and
gage
follows
her
around
the
other
way
and
leans
against
it
yeah
draggin'
it
behind
you
gage
this
meandmyshadow
act
it's
getting
old
what
do
you
want
from
me
lookin'
kinda
foolish
buffy
well
um
it's
a
little
embarrassing
you
see
i'm
a
swim
groupie
aha
oh
yeah
you
know
there's
just
something
about
the
smell
of
chlorine
on
a
guy
oh
baby
hmm
uh
okay
okay
okay
obviously
my
sex
appeal
is
on
the
fritz
today
so
i'll
just
give
it
to
you
straight
there's
something
lurking
out
there
and
it's
making
fillets
of
the
populace
and
i
think
you
might
be
next
uhhuh
and
you
think
that
because
well
it's
already
attacked
it's
already
killed
some
people
you're
one
twisted
sister
you
know
that
cam
told
me
about
your
games
go
find
someone
else
to
harass
what
a
psycho
bitch
man
gotta
be
talking
about
buffy
how'd
you
know
uh
she
and
i
had
this
thing
once
biggest
mistake
of
my
life
yeah
my
condolences
dude
she's
a
real
headtripper
tell
me
about
it
girl
acts
like
she's
god's
gift
or
something
who
is
she
the
chosen
one
exactly
you
know
what
she
really
needs
is
for
someone
to
really
knock
her
down
off
her
notches
yeah
that'd
be
sweet
anyone
in
mind
you're
in
luck
my
friend
just
so
happens
i'm
recruiting
no
ah
somebody
help
ah
help
ah
ah
get
him
off
me
help
ah
why
miss
summers
you're
beautiful
oh
was
that
the
thing
that
killed
cameron
no
that
was
something
else
ssomething
else
yeah
unfortunately
we
have
a
lot
of
something
elses
in
this
town
good
night
hey
walk
me
home
swimmers
take
position
keep
the
stroking
up
alright
keep
it
going
keep
it
going
all
the
way
to
the
end
all
the
way
to
the
end
breathe
deep
gage
you
with
us
or
not
c'mon
let's
go
so
he
spit
it
out
i
thought
angel
liked
blood
he
used
to
maybe
his
eyes
were
too
big
for
his
stomach
or
maybe
there
was
something
in
gage's
blood
that
angel
didn't
like
say
for
example
steroids
that
would
explain
all
their
behavioral
changes
and
their
winning
streak
so
maybe
whatever's
in
their
blood
is
what's
attracting
this
creature
to
them
any
luck
researching
our
fish
monster
zippo
we
couldn't
find
any
sea
demon
that
matched
the
description
that
xander
gave
us
not
that
chicken
little's
much
of
a
witness
but
oh
oh
oh
my
now
that
girls
is
my
kind
of
xander
xander
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
here

sees
you
impersonating
a
member
of
the
swim
team
i
don't
do
impersonations
i
tried
out
for
the
team
last
night
i
made
it
really
yeah
i
figured
i
can
keep
an
eye
on
gage
and
the
others
when
buffy
can't
when
you're
nude
ii
meant
to
say
'changing'
harris
you
can
flirt
on
your
own
time
okeydokey
coachie
i'm
dating
a
swimmer
from
the
sunnydale
swim
team
you
can
die
happy
what
about
jonathon
is
he
involved
oh
no
he
just
sort
of
peed
in
the
pool
oh
oh
don't
you
guys
get
claustrophobic
in
here
i
mean
what's
the
deal
you
perspire
a
lot
you
can't
breathe
oor
read
i
mean
i
guess
you
could
but
the
pages
would
probably
get
all
wet
you
gotta
love
this
undercover
deal
twenty
minutes
in
a
hot
room
with
a
bunch
of
sweaty
guys
where's
gage
i
don't
know
he
was
right
behind
me
putting
his
sneakers
on
oh
my
god
help
me
help
me
ah
help
me
gage
i
don't
think
that
this
is
going
to
need
stitches
but
you
might
wanna
have
your
family
physician
take
a
look
at
it
how
are
you
i'm
definitely
feeling
the
burn
well
the
uh
good
news
is
that
it
would
appear
that
none
of
your
team
actually
died
but
the
bad
news
is
they're
monsters
how
could
this
happen
are
you
saying
you
don't
know
well
you
work
so
hard
you
start
to
win
suddenly
you
think
it's
just
you
you're
inspiring
the
boys
to
greatness
but
in
the
back
of
your
mind
you
start
to
wonder
you
never
asked
any
of
the
boys
if
they
were
taking
anything
maybe
i
was
afraid
to
there
dodd
mcalvy
torn
tendon
gage
petronzi
fractured
wrist
depression
headaches
it's
all
there
in
the
school
medical
records
all
symptomatic
of
steroid
abuse
but
is
steroid
abuse
usually
linked
with
'hey
i'm
a
fish'
there
must
be
something
else
in
the
mix
but
the
point
is
these
boys
were
obviously
drugged
and
nurse
greenleigh
treated
every
one
of
them
she
must
have
known
if
steroids
are
that
dangerous
why
would
they
do
that
to
themselves
they
needed
to
win
and
winning
equals
trophies
which
equals
prestige
for
the
school
you
see
how
they're
treated
it's
been
like
that
forever
sure
the
discus
throwers
got
the
best
seats
at
all
the
crucifixions
meanwhile
i'm
breaking
my
nails
every
day
battling
the
forces
of
evil
and
my
french
teacher
can't
even
remember
my
name
so
what's
the
drill
get
nurse
greenleigh
let's
throw
the
book
at
her
she
probably
went
home
for
the
day
i
think
it
can
wait
xander
why
don't
you
see
if
you
can
find
out
what
these
boys
are
taking
or
at
least
how
they're
taking
it
powders
pills
syringe
i'm
lookin'around
guy
what
about
you
giles
loaded
up
the
tranquilizer
gun
we're
going
fishing
i
feel
good
lovin'
the
swimmin'
had
some
carrot
juice
this
morning
a
little
wheat
germ
mixed
in
with
it
woke
me
right
up
nothin'
like
it
huh
breakfast
of
state
champions
you
betcha
okay
what
do
you
mean
who's
carrying
i
need
a
little
something
to
improve
my
performance
give
me
an
edge
rrr
the
steroids
where
are
they
you're
soakin'
in
it
bud
huh
aromatherapy
it's
in
the
steam
this
has
got
to
stop
carl
those
poor
children
what
are
you
a
quitter
we
got
no
room
for
quitters
on
this
team
do
you
even
understand
what's
happening
listen
to
yourself
i'm
very
close
to
perfecting
this
we
just
need
to
adjust
the
mix
carl
you
can't
be
thinking
of
continuing
to
expose
these
boys
they're
gonna
be
the
best
i
don't
accept
anything
less
they're
gonna
be
monsters
carl
please
don't
make
it
any
worse
you've
already
lost
three
lost
why
they're
not
lost
carl
what
are
you
doing
i'm
just
lookin'
after
my
boys
they
may
be
out
of
the
game
right
now
but
they're
still
a
team
and
a
team's
gotta
eat
carl
you
quitter
they're
absorbing
the
steroid
mixture
through
the
steam
not
they
we
me
we
have
to
find
an
antidote
don't
you
think
the
clock
is
ticking
people
i
wouldn't
break
out
the
tartar
sauce
just
yet
i
mean
it's
not
like
you
were
exposed
more
than
once
three
times
a
fish
guy
oh
whoa
what
am
i
gonna
do
you
you
you
what
about
me
it's
one
thing
to
be
dating
the
lame
unpopular
guy
but
it's
another
to
be
dating
the
creature
from
the
blue
lagoon
black
lagoon
the
creature
from
the
blue
lagoon
was
brooke
shields
and
thank
you
so
much
for
your
support
i
think
we'd
better
find
the
rest
of
the
swim
team
and
lock
them
up
before
they
get
in
touch
with
their
inner
halibut
yes
yes
good
uh
we
also
need
to
know
exactly
what's
in
this
this
steroid
gas
so
that
the
hospital's
toxicology
lab
can
develop
an
antidote
well
i'll
talk
to
nurse
greenleigh
you're
really
getting
into
this
interrogation
thing
the
trick
is
not
to
leave
any
marks
on
that
note
i
think
i'm
gonna
go
have
a
little
talk
with
our
coach
somehow
i
doubt
all
he's
been
giving
these
boys
is
inspiration
you
got
some
imagination
missy
oh
well
right
now
i'm
imagining
you
in
jail
you're
wearing
a
big
orange
suit
and
oh
look
the
guards
are
beating
you
up
you
don't
have
any
proof
tell
me
what's
in
the
steam
after
the
fall
of
the
soviet
union
documents
came
into
light
detailing
experiments
with
fish
dna
on
their
olympic
swimmers
tarpon
mako
shark
but
they
couldn't
crack
it
and
you
did
sort
of
why
what
kind
of
question
is
that
for
the
win
to
make
my
team
the
best
they
could
be
do
you
understand
we
have
a
shot
at
the
state
championship
do
you
understand
that
i
don't
care
it's
over
there's
not
gonna
be
any
swim
team
boy
when
they
were
handin'
out
school
spirit
you
didn't
even
stand
in
line
did
you
no
i
was
in
the
line
for
shred
of
sanity
which
you
obviously
skipped
get
in
the
hole
in
now
this
isn't
over
in
you
think
i
don't
care
about
my
boys
but
i
do
they
count
on
me
so
what
you're
just
gonna
feed
me
to
'em
oh
they've
already
had
their
dinner
but
boys
have
other
needs
no
one
willow
and
giles
must've
rounded
up
the
rest
of
the
swim
team
does
my
neck
look
scaly
to
you
well
of
course
it
looks
scaly
the
way
you've
been
rubbing
it
dry
like
an
idiot
i
need
to
look
in
a
mirror
wait
here
but
feel
free
to
come
in
if
you
hear
me
scream
any
gills
yet
xander
what
are
you
doing
xander
oh
my
god
xander
it's
me
cordelia
i
know
you
can't
answer
me
but
god
this
is
all
my
fault
you
joined
the
swim
team
to
impress
me
you
were
so
courageous
and
you
looked
really
hot
in
those
speedo's
and
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
still
care
about
you
no
matter
what
you
look
like
and
and
we
can
still
date
or
or
not
i
mean
uh
cordy
that's
not
me
oh
my
god
iin
you
go
stay
calm
chaps
either
we'll
find
an
effective
antidote
or
or
uh
sstay
calm
everyone's
accounted
for
except
sean
i
think
we
can
safely
say
we've
found
sean
he
was
in
the
pool
skinlessdipping
where's
buffy
she
hasn't
come
back
yet
great
this
is
just
what
my
reputation
needs
that
i
did
it
with
the
entire
swim
team
what's
up
coach
oh
harris
uh
how
you
feelin'
little
dry
nothing
a
lemon
butter
sauce
won't
cure
where's
buffy
buffy
hurry
your
hand
hold
on
pull
hold

doin'
my
part
for
our
team

then
i'm
meetin'
some
of
the
guys
for
plasma
transfusions
at
five
it's
turned
into
quite
the
busy
afternoon
the
fun
never
stops
with
you
does
it
giles
seems
pretty
confident
that
the
treatments
are
gonna
work
well
turning
into
a
creepycrawly
wasn't
on
my
top
ten
list
of
things
to
do
before
i
turn
twenty
i
want
you
to
know
that
you've
really
proven
yourself
to
me
and
you
don't
have
to
join
the
new
team
next
year
if
you
don't
want
i'd
be
just
as
happy
if
you
played
football
the
people
from
animal
control
have
just
left
our
creatures
have
apparently
made
a
a
dash
for
it
um
so
to
speak
does
that
mean
we're
gonna
have
to
hunt
them
again
no
i
don't
think
so
i
don't
think
we'll
be
seeing
them
anymore
where
do
you
think
they'll
go
home
