i
understand
i'll
take
care
of
i—
it
was
uh
extraordinary
good
luck
of
course
and—and
uh
training—years
of
training
chaoahn
keep
up
you're
new
here
chaoahn
so
take
note
remember
about
training
but
i
honestly
feel
the
largest
part
of
it
was
instinct
instinct
andand
reflexes
there's
a
sort
of
wary
watchfulness
i've
developed
over
the
years
it's
like
another
sense—
spike
spike
hey
what
anya
said
you
were
the
first
said
you
were
evil
you're
supposed
to
be
all
gothroughable
then
what
the
hell
did
you
tackle
me
for
you
berk
what's
that
supposed
to
do
i
uh
i
didn't
think
of
that
more
importantly
you
just
hit
me
why
didn't
your
chip
go
off
yeah
well
well
uh
when
we
were
at
the
initiative
there
was
a
choice
right
either
repair
the
chip
or
to
remove
it
you
had
it
remov—you
removed
the
chip
yeah
had
to
make
a
choice
it
really
is
ok
what's
a
chip
they
removed
the
chip
you
know
this
is
very
dangerous
ah
you
just
heard
the
horror
stories
wear
hoops
they'll
catch
on
something
rip
your
lobe
off
lobes
flying
everywhere
that's
not
what
i'm
talking
about
you
mean
spike
not
having
a
chip
free
range
spike
i
have
to
ask—why
on
earth
did
you
make
that
decision
guess
it
was
instinct
like
you
were
talking
about
i
made
that
up
i
knew
the
bringer
was
there
because
his
shoes
squeaked
buffy
it's
crucial
that
we
keep
these
girls
safe
i
can't
count
the
dangers—the
first
the
bringers
random
demons
and
now
spike
and
the
principal
what
oh
nothing
much
he
was
in
the
school
basement
holding
a
shovel
acting
evasive
plus
he's
got
that
whole
too
charming
to
be
real
thing
going
on
i'm
looking
into
it
oh
well
that
sounds
very
responsible
of
you
balances
out
the
vampireontheloose
issue
nothing's
changed
giles
spike
had
a
chip
before
remember
when
the
first
had
him
kill
and
sire
all
those
people
we
have
no
idea
if
his
chip
was
working
then
a
new
chip
might
restrain
him
should
the
first
attempt
to
activate
him
again
spike
has
a
soul
now
that's
what's
gonna
stop
him
from
hurting
people
buffy
he
can
be
a
good
man
giles
i
feel
it
but
he's
never
gonna
get
there
if
we
don't
give
him
the
chance
buffy
i
want
more
for
you
your
feelings
for
him
are
coloring
your
judgement
i
can
hear
it
in
your
voice
and
that
way
lies
a
future
filled
with
pain
i
don't
want
that
for
you
we
haven't—
things
have
been
different
since
he
came
back
it
doesn't
matter
if
you're
not
physical
with
each
other
anymore
there's
a
connection
you
rely
on
him
he
relies
on
you
that's
what's
affecting
your
judgment
you
think
i'm
losing
sight
of
the
big
picture
but
i'm
not
when
spike
had
that
chip
it
was
like
having
him
in
a
muzzle
it
was
wrong
you
can't
beat
evil
by
doing
evil
i
know
that
well
i
hope
you're
right
you're
gambling
with
a
lot
of
lives
hi
can
i
help
you
seem
kind
of
confused
you
aren't
wearing
a
green
apron
confused
but
sort
of
randomly
observant
sorry
i
just
mean
you
don't
work
here
right
no
right
just
helpful
i'm
xander
lissa
and
i
guess
i
could
use
some
advice
i
can't
even
figure
out
if
i've
got
the
right
kind
of
rope
that
depends
on
what
you
need
it
for
something
like
functional
around
the
house
or
you
know
recreational
by
which
i
mean
for
example
boating
or
mountain
climbing—not
for
tying
someone
up
for
sexy
funky
fun
in
conclusion
rope
can
be
useful
in
various
ways
i
have
a
kayak
again
with
the
random
i
like
it
sorry
i
need
to
store
my
kayak
so
i
was
thinking
maybe
i
could
sorta
suspend
it
from
the
ceiling
in
the
garage
with
ropes
and
a
pulley
or
a
winch
thing
not
a
bad
plan
you'll
need
stronger
rope
than
that
wanna
have
coffee
with
me
later
what
oh
you're
the
only
one
that
gets
to
be
random
now
if
i
were
a
sign
of
being
evil
where
would
i
be
uh
buffy
principal
wood
it's
you
you
looking
for
something
file
folders
and
mechanical
pencils
well
i
want
to
write
on
a
file
folder
with
a
mechanical
pencil
the
supply
cabinet
in
the
outer
office
has
those
things
oh
this
isn't
a
supply
cabinet
my
bad
ok
thanks
hey
buffy
yeah
um
what're
you
doing
tonight
preparing
for
tomorrow's
counseling
sessions
no
really
watching
a
reality
show
about
a
millionaire
well
then
i'd
um—
i'd
like
to
take
you
out
to
dinner
if
that's
all
right
with
you
i
mean
you
don't
have
to
i'm
certainly
not
saying
come
to
dinner
if
you
enjoy
having
a
job
you
know
i
may
have
to
make
up
a
document
saying
i
didn't
just
say
that
and
have
you
sign
it
sure
i'd
be
happy
to
have
dinner
with
you
great
i'll
draw
up
the
paperwork
so
he
asked
you
out
to
dinner
yeah
isn't
that
weird
i
mean
he's
a
principal
he's
a
young
hot
principal
with
earrings
but
he's
a
principal
why
do
you
think
he
asked
me
out
i
mean
he
could
be
interested
right
yeah
sure
you're
a
frisky
vixen
or
it
could
be
workrelated
maybe
i'm
getting
promoted
for
doing
such
a
good
job
oh
right
that—that
makes
sense
too
or
maybe
he
knows
that
i
suspect
he's
up
to
something
and
he's
taking
me
out
to
kill
me
well
you'll
have
to
dress
for
the
ambiguity
you
know
it's
not
even
that
he's
acting
that
suspicious
it's
just—there
he
is
on
the
hell
mouth
all
day
every
day
that's
got
to
be
like
being
showered
with
evil
only
from
underneath
not
really
a
shower
a
bidet
like
a
bidet
of
evil
buff
if
he's
really
interested
are
you
interested
back
i
don't
know
he's
goodlooking
and
he's—he's
solid
he's
smart
he's
normal
so
not
the
wicked
energy
which
is
nice
'cause
i
don't
want
to
only
be
attracted
to
wicked
energy
or
what
if
he
is
wicked
in
which
case
is
that
why
i'm
attracted
to
him
i'm
gonna
wait
for
that
sentence
to
come
around
again
before
i
jump
on
you
know
what
yeah
i
mean
i
think
i
like
him
and
he'd
be
good
for
me
right
help
you
move
on
why
does
everybody
in
this
house
think
i'm
still
in
love
with
spike
no
ii
meant
move
on
from
this
imposed
superselfreliance
let
somebody
get
close
oh
hey
someone's
here
guys
guess
what
happened
buffy
got
a
date
no
i
did
fine
way
to
steal
my
thunder
sorry
if
it
makes
you
feel
better
it's
principal
wood
and
i
think
he's
aligned
with
the
first
also
like
ten
years
older
than
you
right
which
is
like
100
years
younger
than
your
type
yay
someone
who
doesn't
remember
the
industrial
revolution
i
think
they're
gonna
end
up
making
out
oh
principal
wood
she'll
gasp
i
love
your
lack
of
wicked
energy
watch
it
or
i'm
gonna
make
you
talk
about
your
new
girlfriend
who
you
hold
hands
with
under
the
dinner
table
and
think
we
don't
notice
how
'bout
yours
xander
is
she
evil
well
she's
interested
in
me
so
there's
a
good
chance
but
i'm
hoping
for
the
best
we're
going
for
coffee
she
has
a
kayak—
dear
lord
i
hate
that
mall
the
shop
assistants
are
rude
and
everything
in
the
food
court
is
sticky
looks
like
you
found
her
some
stuff
oh
hello
yes
that's
gotta
be
rough
getting
just
like
pulled
out
of
your
home
being
told
you're
a
potential
slayer
not
being
able
to
bring
anything
yes
and
the
language
barrier
is
formidable
i
was
concerned
that
my
mandarin
is
a
little
thin
but
as
it
turns
out
she
speaks
cantonese
which
is
thinner
but
we
muddled
through
and
as
i
suspected
ice
cream
is
a
universal
language
like
many
from
asia
i
am
lactose
intolerant
i'm
very
uncomfortable
what'd
she
say
she's
grateful
to
be
in
the
land
of
plenty
let's
um
go
and
put
away
your
new
clothes
hey
will
do
you
think
you
can
do
a
computer
check
on
principal
wood
see
if
you
can
find
anything
out
yeah
sure
want
me
to
check
your
girl
out
while
i'm
at
it
xand
nope
i'm
going
in
blind
i'm
gonna
be
an
optimist
about
this
why
go
looking
for
trouble
if
it's
gonna
find
you
it's
gonna
find
you
getting
the
most
out
of
your
new
microwave
hm
nice
clock
comma
setting
the
page
3
you
don't
need
a
manual
it's
intuitive
there's
a
button
marked
clock
set
for
pity's
sake
what
kind
of
a
nerd
are
you
no
wonder
you
crashed
your
jet
pack
no
get
thee
behind
me
i
rebuke
thee
take
that
the
first
look
you
monkey
ooh
ahh
it
burns
as
it
ineffectually
passes
through
me
i'm
not
corporeal
remember
also
not
a
vampire
so—a
cross
what
do
you
want
from
me
jonathan
slash
the
first
i
have
an
assignment
for
you
um
i
follow
buffy's
orders
now
i'm
redeeming
myself
for
killing
you—i
mean
for
killing
jonathan
really
why
so
you
can
earn
a
spot
on
her
little
pep
squad
you
think
she'll
ever
let
you
in
you're
a
murderer
confidentially
a
lot
of
her
people
are
murderers
anya
and
willow
and
spike
interesting
and
you're
the
only
one
she
makes
seek
redemption
does
that
seem
fair
to
you
i
guess
not
you
know
we're
headed
toward
a
fight
don't
you
yeah
what
do
you
think
the
world's
gonna
be
like
after
that
newsflash
there's
not
going
to
be
a
slayer
gang
anymore
but
there
is
going
to
be
evil
and
as
long
as
there
is
evil
i
live
and
as
long
as
i
live
you
can
dwell
at
my
side
that
sounds
nice
your
assignment
won't
be
hard
they're
just
little
girls
you
want
me
to
hurt
the
girls
uh
no
not
all
of
them
not
dawn
not
anya
not
willow
and
not
your
friend
buffy
just
the
potential
slayers
that's—that's
horrible
i'mi'm
gonna
scream
and—and
get
buffy
in
here
she
can't
see
me
and
i'm
gonna
keep
talking
until
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say
so
listen
up
ok
the
girls
must
die
i
could
never
do
that
all
those
girls
aall
that
blood—ii
didn't
like
the
stabbing
before
you
don't
have
to
stab
this'll
be
easy
andrew
i
want
you
to
think
willow
brought
something
to
this
house—something
good
something
you
can
use
the
new
microwave
the
gun
i
want
you
to
think
hard
where
did
they
put
the
gun
hmm
i
don't
think
it's
really
a
date
that's
what
i
think
well
it
is
unclear
that's
why
i
chose
a
top
that
says
you
know
i'm
comfortable
in
a
stodgy
office
or
a
swinging
casual
setting—or
killing
you
you
know
if
you're
a
demon
it
also
says
i
sometimes
get
blood
on
my
shoulder
or
it
might
be
pizza
i
don't
think
i
can
fix
it
thanks
for
trying
and
i
wasn't
talking
about
your
date
anyway
i
was
talking
about
this
sham
date
of
xander's
i
think
it's
part
of
a
plan
to
make
me
jealous
well
it's
not
working
are
you
nuts
of
course
it's
working
observe
mymy
bitter
ranting
hear
the
shrill
edge
of
hysteria
in
my
voice
um
i
should
really
go
find
something
else
to
wear
fine
go
leave
me
here
to
stew
in
my
impotent
rage
i'm
also
gonna
pee
so
you
should
probably
go
you
look
nice
oh
thanks
uh
traditionally
one
wears
something
over
this
heard
you
got
a
date
well
it's
unclear
i
mean
i
have
this
whole
theory
about
a
promotion
or
he's
evil
buffy
i'm
all
right
you
don't
have
to—
what
be
noble
i'm
not
really
i'm
all
right
think
i
still
dream
of
a
crypt
for
two
with
a
white
picket
fence
my
eyes
are
clear
good
i'm
glad
thank
you
never
much
cared
for
picket
fences
anyway
bloody
dangerous
you
should
try
this
too
the
going
out
thing
i
mean
i
mean
there's
that
girl
you
brought
to
anya
and
xander's
notawedding
oh
yeah
right
there's
always
girls
who
like
the
look—bad
boy
you
know
does
it
for
some
of
them
yeah
i
can
see
that
i
should
go
i
don't
wanna
be
late
lissa
hi
i
was
afraid
you
weren't
coming
you
said
830
right
did
you
think
i
was
going
to
stand
you
up
well
it
would
be
kind
of
karmic
what
forget
it
i'm
just
glad
you're
here
you're
gonna
love
the
coffee
got
myself
a
redeye—it's
black
coffee
with
a
shot
of
espresso
it's
kinda
rough
if
you're
not
used
to
that
sort
of
thing—
it's
hot
cocoa
well
sometimes
i
don't
sleep
too
good
i
just
lost
macho
points
didn't
i
hey
who
wants
macho
i
like
that
you
like
hot
cocoa
redeye
please
sounded
good
nothing
no
records
or
certificates
college
transcripts
looks
like
the
only
stuff
in
the
system
about
principal
robin
wood
is
superrecent
like
since
he
moved
to
sunnydale
i've
googled
'til
i
just
can't
google
no
more
he's
not
in
there
well
that's
suspicious
anya
calm
down
they're
educational—
what's
this
giles
made
them
for
chaoahn
and
now
she's
locked
herself
in
the
bathroom
there's
other
girls
upstairs
and
they're
starting
to
complain
those
are
flashcards
ii
made
them
to
facilitate
her
training
chaoahn
never
had
a
watcher
the
language
problem—
you
showed
her
these
i
wanted
her
to
understand
the
seriousness
of
her
situation
holy
crap
perhaps
i'll
rethink
the
approach
in
the
meanwhile
wanna
help
us
get
researchy
we're
trying
to
invade
buffy's
date's
privacy
buffy
has
a
date
yes
didn't
you
hear
everybody
has
a
date
buffy
has
a
date
willow's
been
completely
making
out
with
this
girl—
hey
xander's
out
with
some
hardwarestorewhore
it's
date
fest
2003
actually
buffy's
investigating
principal
wood
it's
not
a
date
really
might
be
a
date
for
god's
sake
how
can
anyone
think
about
their
social
life
we
are
about
to
fight
the
original
primal
evil
these
girls
are
in
mortal
danger
didn't
you
see
the
flashcards
this
isn't
right
this
isn't
right
i
know
it
doesn't
look
promising
but
i
swear
this
place
is
great
it's
the
best
kept
secret
in
town
it's
just
right
down
this
way
well
it
is
one
of
the
nicer
dark
alleys
i
promise
you
it's
just
a
little
bit
further
ok
as
they
walk
down
the
alley
a
vampire
steps
out
in
front
of
them
then
two
more
step
up
behind
them
growling
buffy
starts
fighting
them
immediately
there's
a
horde
of
them
now
she
manages
to
punch
them
and
kick
them
away
from
her
one
by
one
until
she
has
opportunity
to
get
her
stake
out
of
her
purse
she
stakes
one
then
another
then
another
you
set
me
up
you
son
of
a—
what
i
guess
we
should
talk
the
restaurant's
right
there
and
you
still
have
to
see
her
like
everyday
yeah
but
i
guess
that's
good
how
is
that
a
good
thing
i
mean
it
seems
like
she
never
let
you
forget
what
happened
well
it's
on
her
mind
a
lot
right
now
because
our
anniversary's
coming
up—i
mean
it
would
have
been
our
anniversary
and
maybe
i
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
forget
it
i
did—it
was
a
bad
thing
and
it
hurt
her
real
bad
and
if
you'd
gone
ahead
and
married
her
even
though
you
had
doubts
that
would've
been
better
i
guess
not
sounds
to
me
like
in
the
long
run
you're
both
better
off
i
know
it
turned
out
good
for
me
and
that's
what
really
matters
right
i
should
have
taken
you
on
a
nicer
date
than
this
well
i
can
think
of
something
fun
to
do
thank
you
this
place
is
nice
how
the
hell
did
you
do
that
i've
had
a
little
practice
never
took
on
two
at
once
before
but
i
have
taken
out
a
vamp
here
or
there
and
some
demons
so
you're
freelance
hm
freelance—
i
guess
that's
a
good
way
to
put
it
and
you
know
who
i
am
you're
the
slayer
right
ok
um
so
i'm
guessing
that
you
don't
work
in
an
office
15
feet
above
the
hell
mouth
because
you
enjoy
educational
administration
well
i
actually
do
enjoy
the
work
but
yeah
yeah
you're
right
i
maneuvered
myself
into
that
school
that
office—just
like
i
maneuvered
you
there
the
hell
mouth
draws
the
bad
things
in
close
and
now
we're
headed
for
something
big
buffy
really
big
and
i
need
to
be
here
when
it
happens
i
want
to
help
so
yyou
didn't
hire
me
for
my
counseling
skills
they're
valuable
too
whwhy
didn't
you
tell
me
about
you
i
wasn't
sure
about
things
yet
yyou
didn't
think
you
could
trust
me
no
no
no
i
wasn't
sure
i
was
ready
yet—ready
to
jump
into
this
fight
and
now
you
are
well
now
the
fight
is
starting—or
starting
to
start—and
i
don't
have
time
to
worry
anymore
i
have
to
do
something
so
you
knew
who
i
was
before
you
even
came
here
yes
how
how
do
you
know
about
slayers
right
ok
see
when
i
was
a
little
boy
my
mother
was
one
the
one
actually—the
slayer
your
mother—
wow
i
didn't
know
that
any
slayers
had
children
well
i
don't
know
of
any
others
she
was
killed
when
i
was
four
i
still
remember
her
but
it's
a
littlefuzzy
you
know
um
something
got
her
a
demon—
a
vampire
oh
man
i
went
through
this
whole
avenging
son
phase
in
my
twenties
but
i
never
found
him
so
now
i
just
dust
as
many
of
them
as
i
can
find
i
figure
eventually
i'll
get
him
that's
probably
why
we
got
jumped
outside
i'm
not
very
popular
with
the
bumpyforeheaded
crowd
and
i
bet
you
aren't
either
no
not
most
of
them
um
so
do
you
have
any
slayer
powers
i'm
sorry
i—i'm
just
so
floored
ii
have
no
idea
what
to
ask
no
i
don't
have
powers
no
superstrength
or
mythic
responsibilities
i'm
just
a
guy
with
a
few
skills
'cause
her
watcher
took
me
in
and
raised
me
so
you
decided
to
tell
me
that's
right
in
a
darkened
little
romantic
french
restaurant
um
yeah
yeah
i'm
not
really
sure
how
that
happened
but
yeah
did
you
find
the
gun
yes
it
was
in
buffy's
underwear
drawer
she
has
nice
things
show
me
well
i
didn't
take
'em
but
there
were
thongs
and
regular
underpants—
show
me
the
gun
oh
here
willow
tried
shooting
kennedy
with
that
great
there's
gonna
be
panic
and
fleeing
when
you
start
firing
so
you're
gonna
have
to
get
them
trapped
someplace
like
the
basement
and
we're
killing
them
because
because
they're
the
future
of
the
slayer
line
when
they're
gone
the
line
is
gone
uhhuh
uhhuh
um
so
why
not
have
spike
do
it
he's
the
one
with
the
trigger
it's
not
time
for
him
yet
you
can
wait
for
the
next
time
they're
training
in
the
basement
but
don't
rely
on
a
locked
door
to
keep
them
in
you'll
need
more
ok
say
um
do
you
have
any
weaknesses
i
should
know
about
if
i'm
gonna
work
for
you
like
uh
kryptonite
or
allergies
what
are
you
asking
oh
nothing
um
are
you—are
you
made
out
of
the
evil
impulses
of
humans
so
if
everyone
was
unconscious
at
the
same
time
you
would
fade
away
you're
asking
a
lot
of
questions
yes
well
i
uh
because
'cause
i'm
evil
and
i
want
to
do
the
best
i
can
at
that
so
i
want
to
know
stuff
like
when—when
do
we
kill
buffy
are
you
wearing
a
wire
wh—what's
going
on
you
think
you
can
trick
the
first
you
think
you
could
squirm
free
i
hold
you
andrew
i
made
you
do
this
jonathan
suffered
he
was
your
friend
and
he
trusted
you
and
now
he
spends
eternity
in
pain
because
of
what
you
did
no
what's
happening
to
you
this
is
what
you
did
to
him
took
away
everything
he
was
and
left
him
like
this
you
started
down
a
road
with
that
action
you
have
to
keep
going
stop
looking
like
jonathan
you're
not
him
you're
the
first
and
you're
trying
to
get
me
to
shoot
innocent
girls
but
i
won't
do
it
i'm
good
now
when
the
fight
is
over
i'm
gonna
pay
for
killing
jonathan
you're
gonna
pay
for
more
than
that
do
you
know
why
because
the
biggest
baddest
first
evil
in
the
world's
angry
with
you
you
think
this
was
smart
wait
i'm
hearing
something
you
think
you
can
trick
me
women
it's
not
in
the
headphones
it's
out
here
you
only
hear
what
i
want
you
to
hear
you
only
see
what
i
want
you
to
see
so
many
dead
girls
there'll
be
so
many
i
knew
it
see
i
knew
it
thanks
for
your
help
selecting
the
ropes
the
one
i
picked
wasn't
strong
enough
yeah
that
would've
been
bad
listen
is
this
because
i'm
friends
with
buffy
who's
buffy
the
slayer
you
know
the
slayer
this
can't
just
happen
it
can't
just
keep
happening
that
demon
women
find
me
attractive
there's
gotta
be
a
reason
you
just
seem
like
a
nice
guy
that's
all
and
i
wanted
to
get
to
know
you
and
kill
me
sure
do
the
ropes
hurt
yes
good
so
we're
thinking
it
didn't
go
too
well
you
should've
let
me
do
this
fast
no
no
no
i
hate
that
ow
you
tried
to
recall
the
ultimate
evil
why
in
a
complex
effort
to
royally
piss
it
off
guess
we
succeeded
pretty
good
huh
god
i
never
should
have
gone
in
wired
redemption
is
hard
getting
back
to
spike's
question
why
did
you
try
to
recall
it
ooh
to
study
it
to
see
if
we
could
figure
something
out
from
what
it
was
saying
because
guys
we
have
to
face
it
we
know
nothing
about
the
first
owie
ow
ow
well
we
know
not
to
record
it
that's
something
why
did
it
appear
to
this
one
then
i
thought
it
was
supposed
to
be
pulling
my
strings
it
said
it
wasn't
time
for
you
yet
ow
i'm
frightened
and
my
chest
hurts
where
the
tape
was
it's
ok
andrew
you
did
good
you
stood
up
to
it
that's
really
amazing
thank
you
you're
a
peach
yeah
what
did
it
want
you
to
do
anyway
shoot
all
the
girls
shoot
girls
not
you
just
the
potentials
oh
well
that's
something
anyway
something
tragic
this
proves
my
point
this
time
is
crucial
we
should
be
circling
the
wagons
instead
of
doing
things
like
going
out
on
dates
when—when
gunplay
is
imminent
willow
call
buffy
get
her
back
here
we
need
to
dispose
of
the
gun
andand
figure
out
our
next
move
i'll
go
get
her
i'll
call
bet
that's
her
sometimes
you're
thinking
about
calling
someone—
no
it's
a
text
message
oh
it's
from
xander
it's
one
of
our
signals
signals
yeah
the
system
we
set
up
a
while
back
like
codes
uh
this
one's
either
i
just
got
lucky
don't
call
me
for
a
while
or
my
date's
a
demon
who's
trying
to
kill
me
you
don't
remember
which
it
was
a
long
time
ago
well
if
we
play
the
percentages
something's
eating
xander's
head
say
that's
gratifying
buffy
will
know
what
to
do
i'll
go
get
her
that's
ok
we
don't
even
know
where
she
went
that's
not
good
i'll
go
get
buffy
i
can
probably
still
track
her
scent
she'll
be
worried
about
the
boy
oh
my
god
mmm
oh
my
god
that
might
be
the
best
thing
i've
ever
had
in
my
mouth
isn't
it
good
they
soak
the
pears
in
brandy
here
you
need
a
bite
with
sauce
mm
what
are
you
doing
here
is
there
a
problem
it's
xander
look
i
know
what
happens
if
that
seal
down
there
gets
all
excited
i
don't
think
you
understand
what
you're
getting
yourself
into
the
seal
opens
and
a
vicious
feral
vampire
creature
comes
out
well
then
you
do
understand
but
uh
what
makes
you
think
that's
like
a
good
idea
the
end
is
coming
the
final
fight
and
everyone
is
hearing
the
drumbeat
it's
telling
us
to
pick
our
partners
align
ourselves
with
the
good
or
the
evil
aaah
couldn't
have
done
it
without
you
xander
thanks
for
the
great
date
you
sure
he's
in
the
high
school
willow
did
a
locator
spell
usual
stuff
i'm
not
surprised
that
school's
at
the
center
of
everything
how
much
longer
'til
we
get
there
ten
minutes
so
how
do
you
two
know
each
other
he
works
with
me
uh
you
know
in
the
struggle
against
evil
mm
cool
xander
buffy
he's
a
vampire
oh
god
hurry
hey
i
think
your
friend's
gonna
be
ok
hey
xand
i'm
here
so
how's
your
date
going
where

believe
buffy
hasn't
brought
him
home
yet
his
slut
ate
him
up
his
slut
didn't
eat
him
up
and
besides
i
thought
you
were
all
angry
at
him
my
feelings
are
changeable
but
intense
i
understand
your
fear

fear
myself
'cause
you
know
i
um
i
enraged
that
primal
force

worried
ii
think
we
should
go
find
them
xander
could
be
injured
or
trapped
or
eaten
up
it
is
late
perhaps
a
little
reconnaissance

be
helpful
