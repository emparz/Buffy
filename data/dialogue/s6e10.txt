plus
a
mother
of
all
nightwedgies
uhoh

dawn
why
didn't
anybody
wake
us
up
where

everyone
willow
didn't
come
home

they
were
out
all
night
where

they
i'm
sure

sure
they
just
lost
track
of
time
when

when
did
the
building
fall
down
i
don't
know
must
have
been
sometime
between
the
first
time
and

shoe
what's
the
hurry

the
hurry

i
left

call
me
love
you
didn't
seem
to
take
issue
with
that
last
night
or
with
any
of
the
other
little
nasties
we
whispered
can
we
not
talk
i
just
don't
see
why
you
have
to
run
off
so
quick
thought
we
could
not
gonna
happen
last
night
was
the
end
of
this
freak
show
don't
say
that
what
did
you
think
was
gonna
happen
what
we're
gonna
read
the
newspaper
together
play
footsie
under
the
rubble
not
exactly
what
i
had
in
mind
stop
make
me
no
no
no
no
ii
have
to
spike
stay
i'm
stuck
here
sun's
up
i
knew
i
knew
the
only
thing
better
than
killing
a
slayer
would
be
f
buffy
what
is
that
what
this
is
about
doing
a
slayer
well
i
wouldn't
throw
stones
pet
you
seem
to
be
quite
the
groupie
yourself
shut
up
i'm
just
sayin'
vampires
get
you
hot
a
vampire
got
me
hot
one
but
he's
gone
you're
just
you're
just
convenient
so
what
now
you
go
back
to
treating
me
like
dirt
till
the
next
time
you
get
an
itch
you
can't
scratch
well
forget
it
last
night
changed
things
i'm
done
being
your
whipping
boy
nothing's
changed
it
was
a
mistake
bollocks
it
was
a
bloody
revelation
you
can
act
as
high
and
mighty
as
you
like
but
i
know
where
you
live
now
slayer
i've
tasted
it
get
a
grip
like
you're
god's
gift
hardly
wouldn't
be
nearly
as
interesting
would
it
no
let
me
go
i
may
be
dirt
but
you're
the
one
who
likes
to
roll
in
it
slayer
you
never
had
it
so
good
as
me
never
uhh
you're
bent
yeah
and
it
made
you
scream
didn't
it
i
swear
to
god
if
you
tell
anyone
about
last
night
i
will
kill
you
right
you're
gonna
want
these
too
pancakes
uh
sure
um
should
we
call
xander
what
if

all
in
a
ditch
somewhere

bad
mom
always
used
to
talk
about
the
ditches
nobody's
in
a
ditch
we'll
call

we'll
give
them
some
time
before
we
wake
them
up
funny
shapes
or

amy

this
blowhard
dude
first
she
made
his
mouth
disappear
thank

angrily
at
willow
i'm

track
of
time
oh
i
never

mean
you
know
it
wasn't
intentional
and
you
know
everyone's
safe

dawnie
no

i'll
just

go
find
some
awake
people
claudete
claudete
all
these
demons
are
starting
to
look
alike
you
got
reptiles
reptiles
with
horns
reptiles
with
gills
and
i'm
still
finding
nothing
of
the
'steal
a
diamond
freeze
a
guy'
variety
ahn
would
you
hand
me
that
one
next
to
you
great
we're
not
even
married
yet
and
already
you've
stopped
listening
to
me
anya
i'm
sorry
but
this
is
pointless
we've
been
researching
forever
and
we're
not
even
close
to
finding
out
who
robbed
that
museum
what's
up
anya
has
a
theory
she
thinks
that
martha
stewart
froze
that
guy
don't
be
ridiculous
martha
stewart
isn't
a
demon
she's
a
witch
please
she
really
of
course
nobody
could
do
that
much
decoupage
without
calling
on
the
powers
of
darkness
guys
while
this
is
fascinating
we
still
have
work
to
do
i
know
i
do
i
can't
decide
whether
to
put
my
bridesmaids
in
cocktail
dresses

or
the
traditional
burlap
with
blood
larva
the
traditional
what
well
i
was
a
demon
for
a
thousand
years
you
don't
expect
me
to
turn
my
back
on
all
the
ways
of
my
people
uh
can
i
weigh
in
on
this
whole
me
wearing
larva
anya
and
xander
no
at
least
i'm
not
asking
you
to
perform
the
groom's
rite
of
selfflagellation
uh
guys
there's
something
out
there
there
is
and
as
much
as
i
hate
to
admit
that
my
bizarre
bridetobe
has
a
point
we're
gettin'
nowhere
here
buff
maybe
it's
time
to
try
something
new
you
know
hit
the
streets
get
spike
on
it
no
no
no
spike
and
no
hit
the
streets
we
we
we
stay
put
you
know
away
from
distractions
we'll
figure
this
out
what
about
willow
can't
she
do
something
maybe
but
she's
home
sleeping
sleeping
she
sick
no
she
was
out
late
with
amy
and
i'm
bizarre
at
least
i
didn't
dump
you
to
hang
out
with
an
exrat
no
it's
not
like
that
you
know
she's
just
helping
amy
through
a
transition
and
making
herself
a
playmate
to
do
magic
with
someone
who
won't
monitor
her
like
tara
no
willow's
a
grownup
you
know
maybe
she
doesn't
need
to
be
monitored
you
know
she's
going
through
something
but
we're
not
her
i
mean
mmaybe
she
has
reasons
for
acting
this
way
and
so
what
if
she
crossed
a
line
you
know
we
all
do
stuff
stupid
stuff
but
then
we
learn
and
and
we
learn
and
and
we
don't
do
it
again
okay
so
you
know
who
are
we
to
get
all
judgey
not
judgey
buff
just
observey
yeah
all
we're
saying
is
she's
acting
different
you
know
she's
not
herself
so
what
do
you
wanna
do
it's
gonna
be
hard
to
top
last
night
yeah
i
don't
know
if
i
can
i
felt
awful
today
and
i
couldn't
do
magic
took
me
all
day
to
get
my
powers
back
i
think
we
should
just
take
it
easy
i
have
a
better
idea
what
i
know
this
guy
and
he
knows
spells
that
last
for
days
and
the
burnout
factor
is
like
nothing
really
he's
a
warlock
i
guess
look
i
am
not
kidding
you
this
guy
will
blow
your
mind
he
will
take
you
to
places
that
you
can't
even
imagine
is
it
dangerous
would
that
stop
you
this
is
it
where
i
thought
you
said
the
guy
lived
around
here
he
does
you
can't
feel
it
what
do
you
amy
takes
willow's
hand

holds
it
up
to
the
air

i
certainly
don't
understand
why
you'd
drag
dawn
into
it
i
don't
know
the
magic
i
i
thought
i
had
it
under
control
and
then
i
didn't
because
of
tara
no
it
started
before
she
left
it's
why
she
left
seemed
like
things
were
going
so
well
it
was
but
i
mean
if
you
could
be
you
know
plain
old
willow
or
super
willow
who
would
you
be
i
guess
you
don't
actually
have
an
option
on
the
whole
super
thing
will
there's
nothing
wrong
with
you
you
don't
need
magic
to
be
special
don't
i
i
mean
buffy
who
was
i
just
some
girl
tara
didn't
even
know
that
girl
you
are
more
than
some
girl
and
tara
wants
you
to
stop
she
loves
you
we
don't
know
that
i
know
that
i
promise
you
i
just
it
took
me
away
from
myself
i
was
free
i
get
that
more
than
you
but
it's
wrong
people
get
hurt
if
something
had
happened
to
dawn
tonight
something
worse
i
know
no
i
don't
think
you
do
ii
i
was
out
of
my
mind
i
i
did
things
i
can't
even
it
won't
happen
again
i
promise
no
more
spells
i'm
finished
good
i
think
it's
right
to
give
it
up
no
matter
how
good
it
feels
it's
not
worth
it
not
if
it
messes
with
the
people
i
love
the
magic
wasn't
all
great
i
won't
miss
the
nosebleeds
and
the
headaches
and
stuff
there
you
go
or
keeping
stinky
yak
cheese
in
my
bra
don't
ask
now
i
don't
have
to
'cause
it's
over
exactly
it's
over
joss
whedon
and
marti
noxon
