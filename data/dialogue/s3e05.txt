i
think
we
should
get
a
limo
a
limo
yeah
a
big
expensive
limo
that
sounds
like
fun
and
it
is
our
last
homecoming
dance
so
maybe
we
should
make
a
big
deal
of
it
you
wanna
talk
fun
public
bus
you
meet
the
funnest
people
back
me
up
here
oz
well
if
it's
a
dollar
issue
we
could
all
take
my
van
van
the
homecoming
queen
doesn't
go
to
the
dance
in
a
van
well
technically
you
haven't
been
elected
yet
although
you
certainly
and
without
a
doubt
will
be
who
else
likes
a
limo
a
private
limo
it
it
is
pretty
cuddlesome
and
if
we
all
split
the
cost
um
maybe
you
know
if
i
go
and
all
why
wouldn't
you
go
you
already
have
your
tickets
i
mean
unless
you
don't
have
a
da
ay
oor
two
to
think
about
it
we
should
all
think
about
it
what's
going
on
here
did
scott
not
ask
her
to
the
homecoming
dance
yet
thanks
cordelia
humiliation's
really
good
for
my
color

think
it

corny
or
something

in
i
mean
you
know
if
you
are
if
you
want
to

want
to
well

accept
that
as
a
'yes'

you
want
me
to
get
you
another
drink
um

excited
about
the
dance
me

iit's
just
me
here
how

nice
solid
guy

makes
me
happy

this
happen
where
was
i
buffy
it's
just
before
we
were
going
out
you

seemed
so
full
of
life
like
a
force
of
nature
now
you
just
seem
distracted
all
the
time
and
yeah
i
know
it's
i'm
getting
better
honest
in
fact
from
here
on
you
are
gonna
see
a
drastic
distraction
reduction
'drastic
distraction
reduction'

saying
that
ten
times
fast

so
glad
that
i
ran
into
you
um
i
had
this
little
incident
last
year
of
getting
kicked
out
of
school
and
i'm
back
now
though
i've
done
all
of
my
makeup
tests
but
i
still
need
one
written
recommendation
from
a
teacher
i
think
the
word
that
principal
snyder
used
was
'glowing'
uh
to
put
in
my
file
so
i
can
prove
that
i
belong
here
and
um
you
are
buffy
bbuffy
summers
third
row
i
sat
by
the
window
uh
your
class
contemporary
american
heroes
from
amelia
earhart
to
maya
angelou
the
class
that
changed
my
life
were
you
absent
a
lot
um
buffy
hi
i
hope
you'll
consider
me
for
homecoming
queen
i
can't
believe
it
my
favorite
teacher
and
she
didn't
even
remember
who
i
was
i'm
like
a
nonperson
am
i
invisible
can
you
see
me
big
as
life
at
hemery
i
was
prom
princess
i
was
fiesta
queen
i
was
on
the
cheerleading
squad
and
the
yearbook
was
like
a
story
of
me
now
it's
senior
year
and
i'm
going
to
be
one
crappy
picture
on
oneeighth
of
one
crappy
page
uh
no
actually
you're
not
what
do
you
mean
well
you
uh
missed
the
picturetaking
when
why
we
did
'em
yesterday
didn't
cordelia
tell
you
thanks
for
your
support
buffy
you
look
so
cute
in
that
outfit
i'm
not
voting
for
you
then
make
it
snappy
how
come
you
didn't
tell
me
they
were
doing
the
yearbook
pictures
didn't
i
oh
i
guess
i
forgot
what's
the
big
it's
just
you
could've
thought
about
somebody
else
for
thirty
seconds
that's
all
hey
i
am
under
a
lot
of
pressure
here
oh
yeah
campaigning
rough
gig
what
would
you
know
about
it
just
because
you
were
guacamole
queen
when
you
were
three
doesn't
mean
you
understand
how
this
works
obviously
it
involves
handing
out
entirely
lame
flyers
no
it
involves
being
part
of
this
school
and
having
actual
friends
now
if
it
was
about
monsters
blood
and
innards
then
you'd
be
a
shooin
i'd
like
to
see
you
try
to
win
the
crown
you
would
then
you
will
what
does
that
mean
i'm
gonna
show
you
how
it's
done
i'm
gonna
run
for
homecoming
queen
and
i'm
going
to
win
this
is
starting
to
be
sad
sorry
cordy
but
you
have
no
idea
who
you're
messing
with
what
the
slayer
i'm
not
talking
about
the
slayer
i'm
talking
about
buffy
competition
competition
is
a
beautiful
thing
it
makes
us
strive
it
makes
us
accomplish
occasionally
it
makes
us
kill
we
all
have
the
desire
to
win
whether
we're
human
vampire
and
whatever
the
hell
you
are
my
brother
you
got
them
spinylooking
head
things
i
ain't
never
seen
that
before
i
am
kulak
of
the
miquot
clan
isn't
that
nice
point
is
you're
all
here
for
the
same
reason
well
it
sure
ain't
no
philosophy
class
now

it
mr
gorch

account
statement
says
that
your
deposit

in
a
few
days'
time
the
first
target
buffy
you've
all
seen
the
second
faith
is
a
little
more
elusive
but
they
will
both
be
together
and
ready
for
the
killing
and
that
is
a
moneyback
guarantee
ladies
gentlemen
spinyheaded
looking
creatures
welcome
to
slayerfest
'98
what
do
you
think
of
this
nice
it's
my
first
big
dance
you
know
where
there's
a
boy
and
a
band
and
not
just
me
alone
in
my
room
pretending
that
there's
a
boy
and
a
band
i
didn't
come
this
far
willow
i
just
want
it
to
be
special
that's
why
i
spared
no
expense
on
the
tux
the
tux
i
thought
you
uh
borrowed
it
from
your
cousin
rigby
for
you
to
make
this
hard
for
me
expense
to
my
pride
will
they're
our
only
relations
with
money
and
they
shun
us
as
they
should
and
now
you
want
to
ask
me
'how'
what
do
you
think
about
this
it's
like
how
does
your
heart
beat
nice
why
do
you
breathe
how
does
your
heart
beat
what
and
why
do
you
breathe

was
just
why

you
come
here

the
eighthgrade
cotillion
you
had
that
clipon
you
weren't
invited
xander

was
pretty
stylin'
with
a
clipon

outside

stay
on
the
outside

and
i
are
gonna
be
in
neighboring
rest
homes
while
i
come
over
so
you
can
adjust
my
um
and
now
you
want
to
ask
me
'why'
my
uh
well
i
can't
think
of
anything
that's
not
really
gross
it's
like
how
does
your
heart
beat
and
how
do
you
cry
so
uh
you
and
oz
how
does
your
heart
beat
how
do
i
put
this
are
we
on
first
second
or
uh
ye
gods
that's
none
of
your
business
alexander
harris
and
there
are
some
things
that
i
like
to
figure
out
xander
ooo
rounding
second
you
don't
know
that
what
about
you
and
cordelia
there
are
some
things
that
i
can
do
without
xander
oh
a
gentleman
never
talks
about
his
conquests
oh
yeah
well
since
when
did
you
become
a
you
and
your
letters
are
gone
forever
they
are
both
struck
dumb
when
they
see
each
other
she
is
wearing
an
elegant
black
sleeveless
fulllength
dress
xander
is
looking
dapper
in
his
tuxedo
they
don't
say
anything
for
a
long
moment
willow
finally
breaks
the
silence
to
finish
her
sentence
gentleman
uh
i
know
'nice'
xander
i
was
gonna
go
with
'gorgeous'
really
you
too
iin
a
guy
way
with
all
the
things
that
you
could
be
xander
oz
is
very
lucky
so
is
cordelia
iin
a
girl
way
you
never
could
learn
how
to
be
me
i
don't
know
if
i
can
dance
in
this
i
don't
know
if
i
can
dance
come
on
piece
of
cake
here
and
now
you
want
to
ask
me
'how'
well
that
seems
to
um
it's
like
how
does
your
heart
beat
why
do
you
breathe
yeah
this
shouldn't
be
a
problem
how
does
your
heart
beat
no
why
do
you
breathe
no
problem
how
does
your
heart
beat
why
do
you
breathe
how
do
you
breathe
that
didn't
just
happen
no
i
mean
it
did
but
it
didn't
because
i
respect
you
and
oz
and
i
would
never
i
would
never
either
iit
must
be
the
clothes
iit's
a
fluke
it's
a
clothes
fluke
that's
what
it
is
and
there'll
be
no
more
fluking
not
ever
we
gotta
get
out
of
these
clothes
right
now
oh
i
didn't
mean
i
didn't
me
either
a
campaign
is
like
a
war
it's
won
or
lost
in
the
trenches
holly
michelle
and
our
real
competition
cordelia
all
have
big
head
starts
speaking
of
big
heads
if
i
had
a
watermelon
as
big
as
cordelia's
i'd
be
rich
waits
for
laugh
okay
you're
right
making
fun
of
the
competition
only
makes
me
seem
petty
now
this
is
just
like
any
other
popularity
contest
i've
done
this
before
the
only
difference
being
this
time
i'm
not
actually
popular
although
i'm
not
exactly
unpopular
a
lot
of
people
came
to
my
welcome
home
party
but
they
were
killed
by
zombies
good
point
okay
here's
the
plan
willow
i
need
you
to
make
a
database
see
who's
for
us
who's
on
the
fence
and
where
our
real
crisis
areas
are
oz
you
take
the
fringe
musicians
those
not
normally
inclined
to
vote
xander
what
uh
cordelia
okay
look
i
know
this
is
a
little
awkward
but
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
we
all
can't
get
along
during
this
campaign
time
i
mean
we're
almost
friends
and
we
are
all
riding
together
in
the
limo
yeah
great
willow
how's
that
database
coming
uh
it's
just
about
done
xander
i
got
your
new
flyers
let's
get
cracking
she's
my
girlfriend
it's
just
that
she
needs
it
so
much
more
than
you
do
as
willow
goes
so
goes
my
nation
thanks
for
what
you
said
buffy
i
think
we're
getting
along
great
don't
you
seems
like
a
lot
of
fuss
for
one
little
title
well
you
know
it's
no
fun
if
you
don't
try
your
best
as
long
as
fun
is
still
in
the
mix
sure
it's
not
like
anyone
takes
it
that
seriously
well
i
don't
wanna
be
president
the
camera
pans
again
and
the
scene
dissolves
to
trick's
abode
and
jungle
bob
checking
his
rifle
superman
or
clark
kent
he
walks
past
the
gruenstahler
brothers
wrestling
with
each
other
i
don't
wanna
walk
'round
in
their
shoes
the
camera
continues
panning
past
lyle
and
candy
gorch
kissing
on
a
couch
'cause
i
don't
know
whose
side
i'm
on
buffy
walks
up
to
the
board
and
posts
her
much
larger
flyer
right
on
top
of
cordelia's
i
don't
know
my
right
from
wrong
cut
to
the
gruenstahler's
boss
checking
maps
and
coordinates
on
his
computer
i
don't
know
where
i'm
going
to
behind
him
his
boys
keep
up
with
their
training
cut
to
jungle
bob
testing
a
bear
trap
he
sticks
a
mannequin
leg
into
it
and
the
jaws
instantly
snap
shut
shattering
the
leg
cut
to
kulak
he
raises
his
arms
and
snaps
them
down
so
his
forearms
are
extended
out
from
him
horizontally
at
his
waist
i
don't
know
about
you
both
of
kulak's
forearms
split
open
from
elbow
to
wrist
and
a
long
serrated
green
throwing
weapon
pops
out
of
each
arm
and
into
his
hands
i'll
be
the
rain
falling
on
your
fire
escape
at
the
bottom
she
fakes
dropping
her
stack
of
flyers
scott
sees
them
fall
and
quickly
kneels
down
to
pick
them
up
sorry
here
and
i
may
not
be
the
man
you
want
me
to
scott
i
heard
you
were
doing
this
uh
yeah
it's
just
something
to
pass
the
time
i
can
be
myself
buffy
it's
silly
really
how
'bout
you
i
don't
think
so
for
what
it's
worth
you
have
my
vote
no
i
don't
want
you
to
feel
thank
you

to
herself
and
pulls
out
her
campaign
notebook

your
dad
she
opens
it
to
a
list
of
names
and
checks
off

dream
come

she
closes
it
notices
another
boy
coming
and
tosses
her
flyers
on

an
accident

down
to
pick
them
up

to
a
hall
buffy

wearing
a
sunnydale
high
team
jacket
and
talks
to
a
group
of
athletes
also
wearing
team
jackets
they
all
smile
at
her
as
she
makes
small
talk
with
them
'cause
i
don't
know
just
what
i've
found
cut
to
her
campaign
book

checks
off
the
name
of
daryl
sancton
cut
to
the
quad
holly
is
about
to
offer
a
brownie
to
a
boy
when
buffy
comes
up
to
him
and
gives
him
a
huge
chocolate
cupcake
she
gives
him
a
radiant
smile
and
then
smiles
smugly
to
herself
as
she
walks
off
i
don't
know
my
sky
from
ground
cut
to
her
campaign
notebook
she
checks
off
leafe
small's
name
i
don't
know
where
i'm
going
to
cut
to
the
quad
after
giving
away
two
more
chocolate
cupcakes
buffy
walks
over
to
a
column
to
post
a
flyer
cordelia
comes
up
to
the
two
students
and
smiles
brightly
as
she
hands
them
each
a
basket
full
of
sweets
and
chocolates
i
don't
know
about
you
cordelia
then
holds
open
a
bag
for
them
to
dump
their
cupcakes
into
hey
hi
how
are
you
you
good
you
look
good
anything
new
hey
did
i
mention
you
look
good
willow
it's
okay
that
you're
helping
cordelia
we're
best
friends
i'm
not
gonna
hold
it
against
you
no
i'm
not
a
friend
i'm
a
rabid
dog
who
should
be
shot
but
there're
forces
at
work
here
dark
incomprehensible
forces
and
i'm
sure
they're
more
important
than
all
we've
been
through
together
or
the
number
of
times
that
i've
saved
your
life
what
do
you
want
fifteen
minutes
alone
on
your
computer
with
cordelia's
database
'kay
good
oh
so
i
spoke
to
the
limo
people
and
we're
all
set
they'll
pick
up
faith
then
me
then
swing
by
and
get
you
guys
now
what's
your
database
tell
you
about
my
weaknesses
you
know
jonathon
i've
always
felt
a
special
bond
between
you
and
me
cordelia
gave
me
six
bucks
that
buys
a
whole
lotta
cupcakes
are
you
kidding
i've
been
doing
the
vulcan
death
grip
since
i
was
four
so
you
really
are
giving
out
money
huh
is
that
any
more
tacky
than
your
faux
'i'm
shy
but
deep'
campaign
posters
yes
this
whole
trying
to
be
like
me
really
isn't
funny
anymore
i
was
never
trying
to
be
like
you
and
when
was
it
funny
i
don't
see
why
your
pathetic
need
to
recapture
your
glory
days
gives
you
the
right
to
splinter
my
vote
how
can
you
think
it's
okay
to
talk
to
people
like
this
do
you
have
parents
yeah
two
of
them
unlike
some
people
your
brain
isn't
even
connected
to
your
mouth
is
it
why
don't
you
do
us
both
a
favor
and
stay
out
of
my
way
don't
ever
do
that
again
you're
sick
you
know
that
okay
let's
not
say
something
we'll
uh
regret
later
you
crazy
freak
vapid
whore
like
that
what
did
you
call
me
this
is
just
the
worst
thing
that's
ever
happened
ever
i
know
i
know
it's
just
when
i
look
at
you
now
it's
like
i'm
seeing
you
for
the
first
time
i'm
talking
about
buffy
and
cordelia
me
too
what
are
we
gonna
do
i
mean
we
have
to
do
something
how
do
you
get
from
'chick
fight'
to
'our
fault'
because
we
felt
so
guilty
about
the
fluke
we
overcompensated
helping
cordelia
and
we
spun
the
whole
group
dynamic
out
of
orbit
and
we're
just
a
big
meteor
shower
heading
for
earth
okay
calm
down
let's
just
put
our
heads
together
and
think
of
something
okay
one
of
us
here
is
pretty
darn
smart
and
i
am
just
in
hell
ii
mean
ii
thought
being
a
senior
at
last
what
sometimes
when
you're
falling
to
pieces
your
mouth
it
just
does
the
sweetest
thing
what
are
we
gonna
do
we
just
have
to
get
the
two
of
them
communicating
i'm
talking
about
us
what's
going
on
here
where's
faith
well
they
bought
us
corsages
i
took
the
orchid
okay
i
don't
see
what
the
big
deal
is
i'm
not
making
a
big
deal
you
wanted
the
orchid
you
got
the
orchid
it
goes
with
my
complexion
better
it
does
have
that
sallow
tint

gonna
get
the
chance
to
tell
