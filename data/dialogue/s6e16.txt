buffy
it's
hideous
oh
my
god
buffy
look
at
its
arms
i
know
but
it's
my
duty
i'm
buffy
the
bridesmaid
dutyschmuty
i'm
supposed
to
be
best
man
shouldn't
i
be
all
marlene
dietrichy
in
a
dashing
tuxedo
number
no
oh
that
would
be
totally
unfair
we
must
share
equally
in
the
cosmic
joke
that
is
bridesmaidsdom
well
maybe
if
i
ask
anya
i
can
still
go
with
the
traditional
blood
larva
and
burlap
i
mean
she
was
a
a
vengeance
demon
for
like
a
thousand
years
she
would
know
all
the
most
flattering
larvae
what
was
she
thinking
i
think
she's
probably
too
stressed
to
be
thinking
right
now
what
with
xander's
relatives
and
her
demons
oh
my
god
last
night
that
rehearsal
dinner
that
was
like
a
a
zoo
without
the
table
manners
and
i
bet
it
got
worse
after
we
left
i
just
can't
believe
everyone
bought
that
story
about
anya's
people
being
circus
folk
did
you
see
the
guy
with
the
tentacles
what's
he
supposed
to
be
inky
the
squid
boy

xander's
family

haven't
seen
them

more
moved
'i'll

it
like

little
stray'
wait
no
'like

you
just
leave
i
wanted
to
i
should
have
yeah
you
should
have
'cause
then
maybe
i
would
have
gotten
some
touch
in
the
past
twenty
years
i
wasn't
the
one
who
stopped
touching
oh
maybe
but
you
weren't
touching
me
what
did
you
expect

to
do
you
wouldn't
come
near
me
after
buffy
xander
don't
bring
her
into

fine
forget
her
maybe
you
were
just
born
to
be
a
bitter
angry
old
man
shut
up
no
i
want
my
life
back
if
i
hadn't
married
you
i
wouldn't
have
had
to
hate
myself
for
the
last
thirty
years
shut
up
i'm
so
sorry
i
didn't
want
to
show
you
what
happened
what
was
that
a
glimpse
of
your
future
harnessed
by
magic
is
she
okay
is
she
okay
what
did
i
do
listen
i
don't
have
long
here
the
spell
that
brought
me
back
it
won't
last
but
you
can
change
things
it
doesn't
have
to
go
like
this
but
you
can't
marry
anya
but
old
man
you'll
hurt
her
less
today
than
you
will
later
believe
me
sometimes
two
people
all
they
bring
each
other
is
pain
hello
buffy
hey
it's
a
happy
occasion
you
meet
my
friend
no
not
yet
but
she
seems
like
a
very
nice
attempt
at
making
me
jealous
is
it
working
a
little
it
doesn't
change
anything
but
if
you're
wildly
curious
yeah
it
hurts
i'm
sorry
or
good
you
want
us
to
go
no
no
i
you
have
every
right
to
be
here
i
pretty
much
deserve
spike
that's
not
true
you
god
this
is
hard
yeah
i
think
we'll
go
go
where
to
your
place
yeah
i
suppose
that
was
the
idea
yeah
evil
of
course
but
i
won't
or
i
i'll
just
go
give
'em
my
best
or
whatever
the
happy
couple
i
will
it's
nice
to
watch
you
be
happy
for
them
even
i
don't
see
it
a
lot
you
uh
you
glow
that's
because
the
dress
is
radioactive
i
should
yeah
but
it
hurts
yeah

welcome

what
about
the
wedding

suddenly
there
was
you
and
you
knew
me
you
saw
me
and
it
was
this
thing
you
make
me
feel
safe
and
warm'

back
to
the
bridal
room
'so

cut
to
the
main
room

restless
fidgeting
in
their
seats
all
the
demons
