alright
you
can
open
them
up
now
fab
what's
the
occasion
faith
as
if
i
need
a
reason
to
show
you
my
affection
or
appreciation
for
running
a
small
errand
at
the
airport
airport
what's
next
gonna
want
me
to
help
a
buddy
of
yours
move
a
sofa
this
isn't
a
free
ride
young
lady
you
know
i'm
beginning
to
think
that
somebody's
getting
a
little
spoiled
maybe
i
should
take
this
back
sorry
sir
that's
my
girl
another
cookie
now
a
package
is
arriving
tomorrow
night
from
central
america
something
and
i
can't
stress
this
enough
something
crucially
important
to
my
ascension
without
it
well
what
would
toll
house
cookies
be
without
the
chocolate
chips
a
pretty
darn
big
disappointment
i
can
tell
you
open
your
present
there
that
look
on
your
face
is
my
reward
this
is
a
thing
of
beauty
boss
well
it
cost
a
pretty
penny
so
you
just
take
good
care
of
it
and
you
be
careful
not
to
put
somebody's
eye
out
with
that
thing
until
i
tell
you
to
any
particular
eyes
in
mind
sorry
honey
that's
okay
well
there's
something
you
don't
see
every
day
unless
of
course
you're
me
that
was
bracing
want
to
do
another
sweep
it's
what
i
live
for
sad
to
say
you
too
tired
no
it's
just
do
you
get
the
feeling
that
we're
kind
of
in
a
rut
a
rut
you
never
take
me
any
place
new
what
about
that
fire
demon
nest
in
the
cave
by
the
beach
i
felt
that
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
so
this
is
our
future
this
is
how
we're
going
to
spend
our
nights
when
i'm
fifty
and
you're
the
same
age

are

great
school

what's
in
the
bag
my
lunch
is
that
the
new
drug
lingo
no
it's
my
lunch
sit
up
straight
sounds
like
your
mom's
in
a
state
of
denial
more
like
a
continent
she
just
has
to
realize
that
i
can't
go
away
well
maybe
not
now
but
soon
maybe
or
maybe
i
too
hail
from
denial
land
faith's
turn
to
the
dark
side
of
the
force
pretty
much
put
the
proverbial
kibosh
on
any
away
plans
for
me
uc
sunnydale
â€“
at
least
i
got
in
you
i
mean
i
can't
believe
you
got
into
oxford
it's
pretty
exciting
that's
some
deep
academia
there
that's
where
they
make
gileses
i
know
i
could
learn
and
and
have
scones
although
ii
don't
know
how
i
feel
about
going
to
school
in
a
foreign
country
everything
in
life
is
foreign
territory
kerouac
he's
my
teacher
the
open
road
is
my
school
making
the
open
dumpster
your
cafeteria
go
ahead
mock
me
i
think
she
just
did
we
bohemian
antiestablishment
types
have
always
been
persecuted
well
sure
you're
all
so
weird
i
think
it's
neat
you
doing
the
backpack
trail
mix
happy
wanderer
thing
i'm
aware
it
scores
kinda
high
on
the
hokeymeter
but
i
think
it
will
be
good
for
me
you
know
help
me
to
find
myself
and
help
us
to
lose
you
everyone's
a
winner
well
look
who
just
popped
open
a
fresh
can
of
venom
hey
did
you
hear
about
willow
getting
into
oxnard
oxford
oxford
and
mit
and
yale
and
every
other
college
on
the
face
of
the
planet
as
in
your
face
i
rub
it
oxford
whoopee
four
years
in
teabag
central
sounds
thrilling
and
mit
is
a
clearasil
ad
with
housing
and
yale
is
a
dumping
ground
for
those
who
didn't
get
into
harvard
i
got
into
harvard
any
clue
on
what
college
you
might
be
attending
so
we
can
start
calculating
minimum
safe
distance
none
of
your
business
certainly
nowhere
near
you
losers
okay
you
guys
don't
forget
to
breathe
between
insults
i'm
sorry
buffy
this
conversation
is
reserved
for
people
who
actually
have
a
future
an
angry
young
woman
oh
buffy
she
was
just
being
cordelia
only
more
so
don't
pay
any
attention
to
her
she's
definitely
got
a
chip
going
maybe
if
you
didn't
goad
her
so
much
i
can't
help
it
it's
my
nature
maybe
you
need
a
better
nature
i
don't
understand
well
i
don't
think
i
can
talk
any
slower
wes
i
want
to
leave
what
now
no
not
now
after
i
graduate
you
know
college
but
you're
a
slayer
yeah
i'm
also
a
person
you
can't
just
define
me
by
my
slayerness
that's
somethingism
buffy
i
know
we've
talked
about
you
going
away
i
got
into
northwestern
that's
wonderful
news
good
for
you
alright
everyone
monsters
demons
world
in
peril
i
bet
you
they
have
all
that
stuff
in
illinois
you
cannot
leave
sunnydale
by
the
power
invested
in
me
by
the
council
i
forbid
it
ah
yes
that
should
settle
it
faith
gone
bad
and
the
mayor's
ascension
coming
up

i
know
it's
complicated
i'm
aware
that
my
graduation
may
be
among
other
things
posthumous
but
what
if
i
stop
the
ascension
what
if
i
capture
faith
i
very
much
hope
you
will
if
i
do
that
then
all
you
guys
have
to
do
is
keep
the
runofthemill
unholy
forces
at
bay
through
midterms
and
i'll
be
back
in
time
for
homecoming
and
every
school
break
after
that
can
we
at
least
think
about
it
perhaps
if
circumstances
were
different
i'll
make
them
different
what
i'm
tired
of
waiting
for
mayor
mcsleaze
to
make
his
move
while
we
sit
on
our
hands
counting
down
to
ascension
day
i
mean
let's
take
the
fight
to
him
no
no
much
too
reckless
we're
at
a
distinct
disadvantage
we
don't
know
anything
about
the
mayor's
ascension
she's
right
time's
running
out
we
need
to
take
the
offensive
what's
your
plan
i
gotta
have
a
plan
really
i
can't
just
be
proactive
with
pep
no
you
want
to
take
the
fight
to
them
i
suggest
the
first
step
would
be
to
find
out
exactly
what
they're
up
to
oh
i
actually
knew
that
i
thought
you
meant
a
more
specific
plan
you
know
like
with
maps
and
stuff
great
we'll
find
out
what
they're
up
to
is
he
in
the
car
no
i'll
take
you
to
him
the
mayor
was
supposed
to
be
here
in
person
with
the
money
well
the
price
just
went
up
i
don't
like
surprises
surprise
you
killed
him
what
are
you
the
narrator
keys
to
the
cuffs
nothing
that
won't
cut
through
steel
no
but
it
will
cut
through
bone
hey
ho
there
it
is
hahahaha
ah
what
happened
to
the
courier
i
was
supposed
to
pay
him
hunh
made
him
an
offer
he
couldn't
survive
you
are
one
heck
of
a
girl
you
know
that
i
mean
geez
the
initiative
the
the
skill
go
on
go
on
i
will
you
know
i'll
tell
you
if
buffy

hey
hey
hey
hey
if
buffy
summers
walked
in
here
and
said
she
wanted
to
switch
to
our
side
i'd
say
no
thanks
sister
i've
got
all
the
slayer
one
man
could
ever
need
what
nothing
oh
it's
cause
i
used
the
bword
huh
don't
tell
me
you're
still
sore
about
that
whole
angelbuffy
thing
no
i'm
over
it
she
can
have
him
better
believe
she
can
she
deserves
that
poor
excuse
for
a
creature
of
the
night
you
on
the
other
hand
can
do
better
don't
do
that
so
what's
in
the
box
the
box
of
gavrock
it
houses
some
great
demonic
energy
or
something
which
his
honor
needs
to
chow
down
on
come
aday
what's
that
maps
and
stuff
plans
for
city
hall
they
were
in
the
water
and
power
mainframe
the
box
is
being
kept
under
guard
in
a
conference
room
on
the
top
floor
there
unfortunately
that's
all
i
could
get
out
of
my
informant
before
his
aggressive
tendencies
forced
me
to
introduce
him
to
mr
pointy
well
now
here's
what
i
think
we
should
do
i
figure
we
can
enter
through
the
skylight
i'll
take
angel
with
me
agreed
and
there's
a
fire
ladder
on
the
east
side
of
the
building
here
yes
yes
fine
but
we
still
need
to
consider
whether
the
mayor
it
won't
be
enough
to
simply
have
possession
of
the
box
right
we
have
to
destroy
it
not
just
physically
ritually
with
some
down
and
dirty
black
magic
hang
on
we
don't
know
what
such
a
ritual
would
require
i
think
the
breath
of
the
atropyx
is
standard
for
this
sort
of
thing
fairly
simple
recipe
xander
i
know
i'm
ingredient
getting
guy
alright
stop
i
demand
everyone
stop
this
instant
i'm
in
charge
here
and
i
say
this
is
all
moving
much
too
fast
we
need
time
to
fully
analyze
the
situation
and
devise
a
proper
and
strategic
strategem
wes
hop
on
the
train
or
get
off
the
tracks
the
mayor
will
most
assuredly
have
supernatural
safeguards
protecting
the
box
oh
we
all
forgot
about
that
did
we
looks
like
a
job
for
wiccan
girl
what
do
you
say
will
big
time
danger
hey
i
eat
danger
for
breakfast
but
oddly
enough
she
panics
in
the
face
of
breakfast
foods
let's
get
to
work
i
have
a
theory
your
snide
remarks
earlier
i'm
guessing
grapes
a
little
on
the
sour
side
didn't
get
into
any
schools
did
you
the
grades
were
there
but
ooh
if
it
weren't
for
that
pesky
interview
ten
minutes
with
you
and
the
admissions
department
decided
that
they'd
already
reached
their
meanspirited
superficial
princess
quotas
and
once
again
the
gold
medal
in
the
being
wrong
event
goes
to
xander
i'm
as
stupid
as
i
look
harris
read
'em
and
weep
creep
usc
colorado
state
duke
and
columbia
wow
these
are
great
colleges
i'm
guessing
they
must
have
seen
a
different
side
of
your
father's
money
go
away
sure
if
you'll
excuse
me
i
have
to
go
back
to
helping
to
save
some
lives
carry
on
i
know
that
you
have
some
important
accessorizing
to
do
now
remember
if
anything
should
go
awry
wesley
and
i
will
create
a
diversion
let's
synchronize
our
watches
i
have
twentyone
four
yes
typical
maybe
we
could
just
count
one
one
thousand
two
one
thousand

be
careful
all
of
you
tea
you
got
the
goods
yeah
essence
of
toad
twiceblessed
sage
maybe
that's
the
toad
well
we
better
be
sure
destroying
this
box
is
supposed
to
be
a
pretty
delicate
operation
well
then
they
shouldn't
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
the
lay
people
oh
willow
laid
it
out
for
us
pretty
well
wow
she
even
drew
helpful
diagrams
that's
the
pedestal
and
the
ingredients
and
us
see
there's
you
and
there's
me
well
how
can
you
tell
which
is
which
i
mean
they
both
look
kinda
stickfigurey
to
me
well
this
one's
me
see
the
little
guitar
oh
gotcha
nobody
like
my
willow
no
sir
there
is
not
okay
toad

oh
yeah
i'm
bad
four
stars
will
now
get
going

gone
got
it
angel
it's
jammed
i'd
like
very
much
to
come
up
now
please
angel
i
know
don't
suppose
you
want
to
help
me
get
down
didn't
think
so
well
this
is
very
unfortunate
i
just
had
this
conference
room
redecorated
for
pete's
sake
at
taxpayers'
expense
and
oh
yeah

they've
got
my
box
yeah
they
do
but
looky
what
we
got
how
did
you
guys
let
how
did
this
happen
we
thought
she
stayed
with
you
they
must
have
grabbed
her
when
she
hit
the
ground
buffy
i'm
sorry
look
it's
nobody's
fault
okay
we
just
need
to
focus
and
deal
oz
i
swear
i
won't
let
them
hurt
her
we
go
back
fullon
assault
they'll
kill
her
we're
assuming
they
haven't
already
no
no
they
know
what
she
means
to
us
she's
too
valuable
as
long
as
we
still
have
the
box
we
trade
we
can't
no
it's
the
safest
plan
it's
the
only
way
right
it
might
well
be
look
we
call
the
mayor
and
arrange
a
meeting
this
box
must
be
destroyed
i
need
a
volunteer
to
hit
wesley
giles
you
know
i'm
right
about
this
wes
you
want
to
duck
and
cover
at
this
point
damn
it
you
listen
to
me
this
box
is
the
key
to
the
mayor's
ascension
thousands
of
lives
depend
on
our
getting
rid
of
it
now
i
want
to
help
willow
as
much
as
the
rest
of
you
but
we
will
find
another
way
there
is
no
other
way
you're
the
one
who
said
take
the
fight
to
the
mayor
you
were
right
this
is
the
town's
best
hope
of
survival
it's
your
chance
to
get
out
you
think
i
care
about
that
are
you
made
of
human
parts
alright
let's
deal
with
this
rationally
why
are
you
taking
his
side
you'd
sacrifice
thousands
of
lives
your
families
your
friends
it
can
all
end
right
here
we
have
the
means
to
destroy
this
box
giles
make
the
phone
call
what
are
you
doing
oh
uh
i'm
looking
for
a
sucking
candy
cause
my
mouth
gets
dry
when
i'm
nervous
or
held
prisoner
against
my
will
and
suddenly
i'm
thinking
sucking
isn't
a
good
word
to
use
around
vampires
hey
did
you
get
permission
to
eat
the
hostage
i
don't
think
so
you're
going
to
be
in
some
trouble
when
the
mayor
ow
just
a
little
taste
she's
not
gonna
be
braindead
but
she'd
be
to
come
back
here
tonight
ever
had
a
dog
what
i
did
rusty
irish
setter
a
dog's
friendship
is
stronger
than
reason
stronger
than
it's
own
sense
of
selfpreservation
buffy's
like
a
dog
and
hey
before
you
can
say
jack
robinson
you'll
get
to
see
me
kill
her
like
one
check
out
the
bookworm
faith
anyone
with
brains
anyone
who
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
to
her
would
try
to
claw
her
way
out
of
this
place
but
you
you
just
can't
stop
nancy
drewing
can
you
guess
now
you
know
too
much
and
that
kinda
just
naturally
leads
to
killing
faith
wait
i
want
to
talk
to
you
oh
yeah
give
me
the
speech
again
please
faith
we're
still
your
friends

can
help
you
it's
not
too
late
it's
way
too
late
you
know
it
didn't
have
to
be
this
way
but
you
made
your
choice
i
know
you
had
a
tough
life
i
know
that
some
people
think
you
had
a
lot
of
bad
breaks
well
boo
hoo
poor
you
you
know
you
had
a
lot
more
in
your
life
than
some
people
i
mean
you
had
friends
in
your
life
like
buffy
now
you
have
no
one
you
were
a
slayer
and
now
you're
nothing
you're
just
a
big
selfish
worthless
waste
you
hurt
me
i
hurt
you
i'm
just
a
little
more
efficient
aw
here
i
just
thought
you
didn't
have
a
comeback
you're
begging
for
some
deep
pain
i'm
not
afraid
of
you
let's
see
what
we
can
do
about
that
girls
i
hope
i
don't
have
to
separate
you
two
faith
you
can
play
with
your
new
toy
later
something's
come
up
faith
you
know
i
don't
like
repeating
myself
i
got
someone
i
got
him
i
just
received
a
heck
of
an
interesting
phone
call
the
whole
place
is
locked
down
except
for
the
front
yeah
it
gives
me
that
comforting
trapped
feeling
one
way
out
means
one
way
in
i
want
to
see
them
coming
guess
they're
shy
i
can
see
alright
well
this
is
exciting
isn't
it
clandestine
meetings
by
dark
of
night
exchange
of
prisoners
i
just
i
i
feel
like
we
should
all
be
wearing
trench
coats
let
her
go
no
not
until
the
box
is
in
my
hands
so
you're
the
little
girl
that's
been
causing
me
all
this
trouble
she's
pretty
angel
a
little
skinny
still
don't
understand
why
it
couldn't
work
out
with
you
and
my
faith
guess
you
kind
of
just
have
strange
taste
in
women
well
what
can
i
say
i
like
them
sane
angel
well
i
wish
you
kids
the
best
i
really
do
but
if
you
don't
mind
a
bit
of
fatherly
advice
i
uh
ii
just
don't
see
much
of
a
future
for
you
two
i
don't
sense
a
lasting
relationship
and
not
just
because
i
plan
to
kill
you
you
two
have
a
bumpy
road
ahead
i
don't
think
we
need
to
talk
about
this
god
you
kids
you
know
you
don't
like
to
think
about
the
future
you
don't
like
to
make
plans
unless
you
want
faith
to
gut
your
friend
like
a
sea
bass
show
a
little
respect
for
your
elders
you're
not
my
elder
i've
got
a
lotta
years
on
you
yeah
and
that's
just
one
of
the
things
you're
going
to
have
to
deal
with
you're
immortal
she's
not
it's
not
i
married
my
edna
may
in
oughtthree
and
i
was
with
her
right
until
the
end
not
a
pretty
picture
wrinkled
and
senile
and
cursing
me
for
my
youth
wasn't
our
happiest
time
and
let's
not
forget
the
fact
that
any
moment
of
true
happiness
will
turn
you
evil
i
mean
come
on
what
kind
of
a
life
can
you
offer
her
i
don't
see
a
lot
of
sunday
picnics
in
the
offing
i
see
skulking
in
the
shadows
hiding
from
the
sun
she's
a
blossoming
young
girl
and
you
want
to
keep
her
from
the
life
she
should
have
until
it
has
passed
her
by
my
god
i
think
that's
a
little
selfish
is
that
what
you
came
back
from
hell
for
is
that
your
greater
purpose
make
the
trade
well
that
went
smooth
nobody
moves
i
knew
you
kids
were
up
to
something
snyder

not
giving
orders

suppose

going
to
tell
me

a
problem

about
fifty
billion
of
these
happy
little
critters

you
like
to
see

your
hand

invulnerable
faith

alright
so
faith
was
like
i'm
going
to
beat
you
up
and
i'm
all
i'm
not
afraid
of
you
and
then
she
had
the
knife
which
was
less
fun
aand
then
oh
ii
told
her
you
made
your
choice
buffy
was
your
friend
this
is
fascinating
but
let's
get
back
to
the
point
you
actually
had
your
hands
on
the
books
of
ascension
volumes
one
through
five
is
there
anything
you
can
remember
that
could
be
of
use
to
us
anything
at
all
well
i
was
in
a
hurry
and
what
i
did
read
was
kind
of
overinvolved
if
you
ask
me
way
overwritten
actually
there
were
a
few
pages
that
looked
kind
of
interesting
but
i
didn't
have
a
chance
to
read
them
fully
see
what
you
can
make
of
them
this
is
your
night
for
suave
will
you
should
get
captured
more
often
no
thank
you
well
let's
hope
there
is
something
useful
in
those
pages
the
mayor
has
the
box
of
gavrock
as
of
now
we
are
right
back
where
we
started
wouldn't
you
say
deep
thoughts
deep
and
meaningful
as
in
as
in
i'm
never
getting
out
of
here
i
kept
thinking
if
i
stopped
the
mayor
or
but
i
was
kidding
myself
i
mean
there
is
always
going
to
be
something
i'm
a
sunnydale
girl

other
choice
must
be
tough
i
mean
here

to
any
college
in
the
country

of
you
the
other
night
you
know
being
captured
and

kind
of
got
clear
i
mean
you've
been
fighting
evil
here
for
three
years
and
i've
helped
some
and
now
we're
supposed
to
decide
what
we
want
to
do
with
our
lives
and
i
just
realized
that
that's
what
i
want
to
do
fight
evil
help
people
i
mean
ii
think
it's
worth
doing
and
i
don't
think
you

it
because
you
have
to
it's
a
good
fight
buffy
and
i
want
in
i
kind
of
love
you
and
besides
i
have
a
shot
at
being
a
badass
wiccan
and
what
better
place
to
learn
i
feel
the
need
for
more
sugar
than
the
human
body
can
handle
mochas
yes
please
it's
weird
you
look
at
something
and
you
think
you
know
exactly
what
you're
seeing
and
then
you
find
out
it's
something
else
entirely
neat
huh
sometimes
it
is
chase
what
are
you
doing
your
break's
been
over
for
ten
minutes
i
still
need
you
to
restock
the
shelves
and

the
storage
room

go
it's
gonna
be
fun
will
and
i
are
going
to
go
on
saturday
to
check
out
the
campus
i'm
hoping
mom
will
let
me
live
there
it's
too
far
to
come
home
every
night
plus
the
whole
lack
of
cool
factor
either
way
i'll
be
close
to
your
place
i
don't
know
what
the
mayor
was
talking
about
how
could
he
know
anything
about
us
well
he's
evil
big
time
he
doesn't
even
know
what
a
lasting
relationship
is
no
probably
the
only
lasting
relationship
he's
ever
had
is
with
evil
yeah
big
stupid
evil
guy
we'll
be
okay
we
will
