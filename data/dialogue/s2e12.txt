an
outfit
an
outfit
that

never
buy
but
i
looked
good
in
it
you
looked
like
a
streetwalker
but
a
thin
streetwalker
that's
probably
not
gonna
be
the
winning
argument
is
it
you're
just
too
young
to
wear
that
yeah
and
i'm
gonna
be
too
young
to
wear
it
until

i'll
just
have
to
fit

in
tomorrow
sorry
a
little
responsibility
is
all
i
ask
honestly
don't
you
ever
think
about
anything
besides
boys
and
clothes
saving
the
world
from
vampires
i
swear
sometimes
i
don't
know
what
goes
on
in
your
head
xander
shhhshsh
it's
just
that
i'm
worried
we're
gonna
miss
class
you
know
what
this
would
work
a
lot
better
for
me
if
you
didn't
talk
well
it'd
work
a
lot
better
for
me
with
the
lights
off
are
you
saying
that
you
can't
look
at
me
when
we
do
whatever
it
is
we
do
no
it's
not
that
i
can't
it's
just
more
i
don't
want
to
that's
great
that's
just
dandy
we're
repulsed
by
each
other
we
we
hide
from
our
friends
well
i
should
hope
so
please
all
in
all
this
is
not
what
i'd
call
a
big
selfesteem
booster
tell
me
about
it
just
look
at
you
and
those
clothes
where
did
you
get
those
shoes
okay
you
know
what
i
don't
need
this
ditto
like
a
hole
in
the
head
sex
sex
the
sex
drive
in
the
human
animal
is
intense
how
many
of
us
have
lost
countless
productive
hours
plagued
by
unwanted
sexual
thoughts
and
feelings
yes
mmhm
that
was
a
rhetorical
question
mr
harris
not
a
poll
oh
of
course
for
teenagers
such
as
yourselves
these
feelings
are
even
more
overwhelming
with
all
sorts
of
hormones
surging
through
your
bodies
compelling
you
to
action
it's
often
difficult
to
remember
that
there
are
negative
consequences
to
uh
having
sex
would
anyone
care
to
offer
one
such
consequence
well
that
depends
are
you
talking
about
sex
in
the
car
or
out
of
the
car
because
i
have
a
friend
not
me
that
was
in
a
miata
at
parked
at
the
top
of
the
hill
and
then
she
kicked
the
gearshift
and
and
yeah
i
i
was
thinking
of
something
a
little
more
commonplace
ms
chase
you
wanna
talk
negative
consequence
what
about
the
heartbreak
of
halitosis
i
mean
a
girl
may
seem
spiffy
but
if
she
ignores
her
flossing
the
bloom
is
definitely
off
the
rose
like
that
compares
to
kissing
a
guy
who
thinks
the
hoover
technique
is
a
big
turnon
what
about
having
to
feign
interest
in
her
vapid
little
chit
chat
just
so
you
can
get
some
touch
now
another
consequence
of
sexual
activity
anyone
uh
else
how
about
pregnancy
that
would
be
a
major
one
right
thank
you
ms
rosenberg
among
teens
unwanted
pregnancy
is
the
number
one
negative
consequence
of
sexual
activity
so
as
discussed
last
week
i
present
you
with
your
offspring
you
will
split
into
parenting
teams
you
and
your
partner
will
share
equally
in
the
daily
task
of
raising
your
egg
now
please
choose
a
partner
and
come
pick
up
your
children
you
wanna
have
a
baby
hey
i
know
we
just
met
but
isn't
that
xander
jr
you're
holding
buffy
how
come
you
weren't
in
class
vampire
issues
did
mr
whitmore
notice
i
was
tardy
i
think
the
word
you're
searching
for
is
'absent'
tardy
people
show
right
and
yes
he
did
notice
so
he
wanted
me
to
give
you
this
as
far
as
punishments
go
this
is
fairly
abstract
no
it's
your
baby
okay
i
get
it
even
less
well
you
know
it's
the
whole
'sex
leads
to
responsibility'
thing
which
i
personally
don't
get
you
gotta
take
care
of
the
egg
it's
a
baby
you
gotta
keep
it
safe
and
teach
it
christian
values
my
egg
is
jewish
then
teach
it
that
dreidel
song
i
can't
do
this
i
can't
take
care
of
things
i
killed
my
giga
pet
literally
i
sat
on
it
and
it
broke
you'll
do
fine
yeah
the
only
thing
that
stresses
me
is
when
do
we
tell
them
that
they're
adopted
i'll
just
lay
that
one
off
on
my
partner
who'd
i
get
well
there
were
an
uneven
number
of
students
and
you
didn't
show
so
i'm
a
single
mother
no
man
of
her
own
do
you
know
what
this
says
about
me
that
i
am
doomed
to
lead
my
mother's
life
how
deeply
scary
is
that
how
'bout
this
it
says
nothing
it
means
nothing
this
whole
egg
experiment
thing
is
completely
pointless
success
at
last
your
playmate
is
a
fellow
of
repute
it
seems
that's
um
lyle
gorch
and
that
one's
his
brother
tector
friendly
little
demons
that
was
before
they
became
vampires
bbut
um
the
good
news
is
that
they're
not
amongst
the
great
thinkers
of
our
times
i
doubt
if
they're
up
to
much
they're
probably
just
drawn
here
by
the
uh
hellmouth's
energy
'nuff
said
i
propose
buffy
slays
'em
all
in
favor
aye
ii
don't
think
you
should
underestimate
them
i
mean
yyou
may
need
to
have
some
help
if
if
if
if
why
do
you
all
have
eggs
hey
maybe
you
can
have
angel
help
you
find
the
gorches
yes
yes
yes
that's
not
a
bad
idea
strength
in
numbers
oh
right
i
see
a
lotta
hunting
getting
done
in
that
please
like
angel
and
i
are
just
helpless
slaves
to
passion
i
really
i
know
you
know
this
isn't
hunting
in
the
classical
sense
we
should
you're
right
okay
okay
okay
you
see
anything
no
okay
enough
hunting
that
the
slayer
yep
ain't
that
angelus

her
yep

and
how
come
he's
about
to
make
me
blush
well
i
don't

how
come

always
askin'
me
so
many
stupid
questions
so
you
wanna
take

lyle
i
say
we
leave
it
wait
till
she's
alone
why
you
scared
nope
i
could
whip
'em
both
right
now
if
i
wanted
to
then
why
don't
ya
'cause
i
got
me
a
plan
i'm
the
one
that
does
the
thinkin'
'member
yeah

the
thinkin'
lyle

your
department

nice
place
a
motel

safe
we're
just
gonna
follow
her
around
a
little
while
find
our
time
'cause
this
ain't
over
i
think
you
are
afraid
of
the
slayer
alright
i'm
gonna
beat
you
like
a
redheaded
stepchild
throw
your
ass
out
in
that
sunlight
c'mon

think
you
can
giddyup
son
oh
man
yippekiyay
matey
oh
oh
god
at
least
eat
something
if
you're
gonna
drink
that
not
that
hungry
how's
the
parenting
going
fine
are
you
sure
your
egg
is
secure
in
that
did
i
ask
for
backseat
mommying
are
we
a
little
touchy
this
morning
no
i
just
feel
all
funky
hmm
you
don't
have
a
fever
oh
no
it's
not
that
i
just
i
didn't
sleep
well
what's
the
matter
your
egg
keep
you
up
all
night
you're
killing
me
parenting's
a
pain
wait
till
it
starts
dating
oh
why
are
you
three
hanging
about
don't
you
have
classes
to
go
to
teen
health
got
canceled
mr
whitmore's
out
couldn't
find
an
egg
sitter
or
something
well
then
can
you
give
me
a
hand
no
sure
how
did
the
um
hunt
go
last
night
buffy
no
go
uh
'no'
'no'
you
didn't
go
or
or
or
you
were
unsuccessful
no
gorches
apparently
buffy
has
decided
the
problem
with
the
english
language
is
all
those
pesky
words
you
angel
big
smoochies
shut
up
iit's
true
buffy
you
and
willow
do
seem
a
little
sluggish
are
you
quite
sure
everything's
alright
maybe
something
we
ate
or
perhaps
it's
the
burden
of
parenthood
notice
how
seriously
you
two
have
taken
this
egg
thing
xander
maybe
you
shouldn't
that's
exactly
what
i'm
talking
about
you
can't
stress
over
every
little
thing
a
child
picks
up
on
that
which
is
a
oneway
ticket
to
neurotic
city
it
didn't
break
how
come
it
didn't
break
which
is
another
secret
to
conscientious
egg
care
pot
of
scalding
water
and
about
eight
minutes
you
boiled
your
young
yeah
i
know
it
sounds
cruel
but
sometimes
you
gotta
be
cruel
to
be
kind
i
mean
you
can
bet
that
little
xander
here
is
thickskinned
now
technically
that
would
be
cheating
yes
no
it's
like
a
short
cut
you
know
when
you
run
a
race
that
would
also
be
cheating
you
should
be
ashamed
i
suppose
there
is
a
sort
of
machiavellian
ingenuity
to
your
transgression
i
resent
that
or
possibly
thank
you
figures
you
three
would
all
be
hanging
in
the
dungeon
while
something
major's
going
on
at
sunnydale
high
and
what
would
that
be
cordelia
barrette
appreciation
day
mr
whitmore
didn't
show
today
that
news
is
of
the
past
he's
missing
presumed
dead
presumed
by
whom
well
me
i
think
we
should
give
him
a
few
hours
before
we
give
up
on
him
completely
well
i
think
we
should
look
around
don't
you
xander
it
can
wait
well
his
body
could
fall
out
of
a
closet
somewhere
so
we
should
check
some
closets
to
see
if
he's
in
a
closet
you're
right
there
could
be
a
closet
let's
go
you
guys
look
for
more
clues
we'll
meet
back
here
we'll
get
right
on
it
are
they
getting
weirder
have
you
noticed
the
weirdness
of
them
they're
weird
should
i
have
guilt
about
not
looking
for
mr
whitmore
ii'd
rather
you
conserve
your
strength
for
hunting
the
gorches
i'll
be
fine
by
tonight
maybe
i'll
sweep
the
cemetery
well
be
careful
iiif
you're
still
feeling
a
little
sluggish
no
worries
and
angel's
helping
you
right
he
does
what
he
can
ahh
as
much
as
i
hate
to
say
this
we
should
really
go
kill
bad
guys
it's
late
you
should
really
get
home
hmm
what
about
the
gorches
i'll
hunt
really
you'd
do
that
not
like
i
have
an
early
day
tomorrow
mm
true
i
still
have
to
go
home
and
fill
out
my
egg
diary
your
what
oh
i
told
you
that
faux
parenting
gig
we're
doing
at
school
like
i'm
really
planning
to
have
kids
anytime
soon
uh
maybe
someday
in
the
future
when
i'm
done
having
a
life
but
right
now
kids
would
be
just
a
little
too
much
to
deal
with
i
wouldn't
know
i
don't
well
you
know
i
i
can't
oh
that's
okay
um
ii
figured
there
were
all
sorts
of
things
vampires
couldn't
do
you
know
like
work
for
the
telephone
company
or
volunteer
for
the
red
cross
or
have
little
vampires
so
you
don't
think
about
the
future
no
never
no
you
really
don't
care
what
happens
a
year
from
now
angel
when
i
look
into
the
future
aa
all
i
see
is
you
all
i
want
is
you
i
know
the
feeling
hello

anybody
in
here

fine
but
but
your
egg
iis
totally
normal
uh

gorch

sure
she

much
better
than
that
young
lady
i
had
a
bad
dream
oh
no
you're
about
to
have
a
bad
dream

dream

mr
whitmore
gave
you
it's
in
my
bear
so
your
egg
isn't
acting
odd
or
anything
it
isn't
acting
anything
it's
an
egg
buffy
it
doesn't
emote
shanisse
is
that
your
real
hair
hey
hi
mm
cardboardy
sorry
junior
but
a
man's
gotta
eat
so
was
there
any
more
hatchling
activity
last
night
no
uh
you
were
probably
right
it
was
just
a
trap
from
them
set
for
me
and
mm
everyone
else's
egg
seemed
perfectly
normal
did
you
bring
the
thing
that
attacked
you
yeah
giles
wants
to
see
it
he's
in
full
research
mode
okay
well
bring
it
to
the
science
lab
and
i'll
get
giles
and
we'll
analyze
it
great
you
know
i
always
say
that
a
day
without
an
autopsy
hey
can
i
just
say
gyughhh
i
see
your
'gyughhh'
and
raise
you
a
nyaghhh
what
is
it
we
don't
know
what
it
is
cordelia
that's
why
we're
here
'capisce'
what
are
you
world
traveler
now
hey
where's
giles
i
know
he
won't
wanna
miss
this
he
said
to
get
started
he'll
be
by
as
soon
as
possible
so
okay
get
started
buffy
dissect
it
or
something
me
why
do
i
have
to
dissect
it
uh
because
you're
the
slayer
and
i
slayed
my
work
here
is
done
oh
no
i
almost
ate
one
of
those
things
i
think
i've
fulfilled
my
grossout
quota
for
the
decade
guys
do
we
even
know
what
to
look
for
i
mean
how
are
we
supposed
to
figure
out
what
this
thing
is
turn
it
over
maybe
we
missed
its
id
bracelet
so
now
i
guess
uh
we
know
what
happened
to
mr
whitmore
he
saw
this
and
ran
away
try
best
case
scenario
it's
possible
that
mr
whitmore
wasn't
harmed
maybe
the
offspring
simply
used
him
to
return
to
the
mother
bezoar
yeah
maybe
he
what

bez
