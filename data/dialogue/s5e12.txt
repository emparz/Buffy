here
i'll
get
that
sorry
mom's
still
not
a
hundred
percent
and
i
guess
i
haven't
really
been
taking
up
the
slack
no
the
place
looks
fine
buffy
yeah
it's
just
us
that
must
have
belonged
to
uh
um
aren't
we
supposed
to
have
a
meeting
uh
yes
yes
we
we're
here
for
a
reason
i've
had
some
rather
uh
well
i've
had
some
news
it
seems
that
the
council
of
watchers
has
found
some
information
that
may
help
us
out
about
glory
presumably
we'll
find
that
out
when
they
arrive
could
be
very
important
arrive
they're
coming
here
now
wwhy
do
they
have
to
come
here
yeah
don't
they
have
phones
'allo
buffy
here's
some
stuff
we
know
pip
pip'
buffy
yeah
phones
see
i'd
like
them
on
phones
well
what's
so
bad
about
them
coming
here
aren't
they
good
guys
i
mean
watchers
that's
just
like
other
gileses
right
yeah
they're
scary
and
horrible
um
they
well
they
can
appear
a
bit
well
uh
hardnosed
but
uh
well
essentially
their
agenda
is
the
same
as
ours
they
want
to
save
the
world
and
kill
demons
kill
the
current
demons
right
current
demons
giles
i
don't
want
them
to
come
here
i
don't
trust
them
make
them
not
come
here
they're
probably
already
on
their
way
our
old
friend
quinton
travers
is
heading
up
the
delegation
they
put
me
through
that
test
and
it
almost
killed
me
and
then
when
i
was
faith
they
almost
killed
me
again
honestly
i
really
can't
handle
almost
being
killed
right
now
i
don't
like
the
sound
of
this
they
don't
sound
very
exdemoncompatible
are
you
sure
they're
english
ii
thought
english
people
were
um
gentler
then
uh
normal
maybe
it
won't
be
so
bad
this
time
i
mean
buffy
they
did
think
you
were
faith
last
time
now
that
they
know
you're
just
you
maybe
they
won't
care
enough
to
kill
you
it's
not
just
that
they're
gonna
screw
everything
up
iit's
a
delicate
time
right
now
ii
have
to
take
care
of
dawn
and
xander
but
that's
not
new
you've
always
taken
care
of
her
right
right
i
i
know
that
it's
just
you
know
there's
there's
glory
and
and
i
don't
need
the
council
looking
over
my
shoulder
when
i
don't
even
know
what
we're
dealing
with
well
that's
precisely
why
we
need
to
talk
to
them
dawn
honey
what
are
you
doing
up
at
this
hour
go
back
to
bed
i
was
just
getting
a
snack
dawn
are
you
listening
i
can
get
a
snack
if
i
want
to
she
was
listening
does
it
matter
i
mean
is
she
really
gonna
set
the
junior
high
school
buzzing
with
'ooh
there's
a
delegation
acoming'
no
i
i
guess
not
you
know
it's
just
sometimes
we
say
stuff
and
and
it's
all
good
giles
you
were
saying
something
um
just
that
if
the
council
knows
something
about
glory
her
agenda
or
her
origins
then

then
maybe
it
will
help
us
get
a
a
a
grip
on
what
we're
dealing
with
right
now
i
think
we're
we're
a
bit
lost
mistress
at
last
we've
found
one
look
don't
hurt
me
i
beg
of
you
if
you
just
let
me
go
i
swear
i
won't
tell
anyone
help
her
we're
here
for
you
great
one
what
dreg
drink
oh
what
is
this
what
the
what
the
hell
are
you
things
doing
to
me
very
good
delicious
no
i'm
good
it's
okay
i
know
you're
all
always
looking
at
me
i
can
tell
always
tell
i
can
see
i
my
hat
where's
my
hat
try
not
cutting
things
so
close
next
time
understood
yes
we
live
to
serve
as
always
cool
take
this
mess
out
with
the
rest
of
the
trash
and
you

have
something
to
tell
me
indeed
glorificus
well
i'm
waiting
we
have
found
that
the
signs
of
the
alignment
are
moving
faster
than
expected
meaning
if
you
are
to
use
the
key
you
must
act
quickly
fine
i
have
been
cooling
my
heels
in
this
crappy
little
town
long
enough
sunnydale's
got
too
many
demons
and
not
enough
retail
outlets
all
you
need
is
the
key
yes
and
i
bet
mousy
the
vampire
slayer
has
an
idea
where
it
is
if
i
may
remind
your
eminence
you
don't
have
much
time
baby
if
that
girl's
the
only
thing
between
me
and
my
key
i
don't
need
much
time
well
if
you're
serious
about
these
matters
all
right
but
you
need
to
be
very
careful
measure
precisely
and
and
please
don't
step
ahead
no
he's
quite
right
you
wouldn't
want
to
do
anything
dangerous
turn
the
wrong
person
into
a
badger
quinton
i
didn't
realize
you
were
here
well
evidently
been
a
while
i
see
you've
uh
brought
some
of
our
colleagues
with
you
would
you
care
to
introduce
us
well
first
i
thought
we
might
catch
up
well
certainly
certainly
uh
well
um
this
is
the
shop
obviously
uh
iit's
been
a
very
interesting
transition
into
the
world
of
retail
but
i
think
it's
gone
rather
well
i'll
give
you
the
grand
tour
if
you
like
no
that's
all
right
i
think
i
can
see
what
you've
been
up
to
yes
well
i
i
uh
do
limit
my
time
here
obviously
buffy
and
i
have
been
training
a
great
deal
these
days
uh
there's
a
a
back
room
oh
yes
i
thought
perhaps
you
were
keeping
that
space
for
the
really
dangerous
items
that
should
be
kept
out
of
the
public's
hands
or
maybe
you
don't
worry
about
that
i'm
very
careful
most
of
this
stuff
couldn't
harm
anyone
incense
dime
store
trinkets
but
there
are
some
things
i'm
sorry
who
are
you
there
are
some
very
potent
elements
here
focusing
crystals
runic
artifacts
an
amulet
of
cauldis
also
this
statue
its
removal
from
burma
is
a
criminal
offense
and
when
triggered
it
has
the
power
to
melt
human
eyeballs
in
that
case
i
severely
underpriced
it
uh
giles
sorry
but
this
is
just
for
the
duration
of
our
stay
i
think
you
can
see
why
what
what
whawhat
is
just
for
the
duration
magic
box
shoppers
we're
going
to
have
to
ask
you
to
leave
the
store
is
uh
closing
early
today
terribly
sorry
for
the
inconvenience
hey
giles
what
are
they
doing
customers
please
bring
your
money
back
you
knew
you
were
gonna
do
this
before
you
even
saw
the
place
i'm
sorry
it's
just
for
the
duration
of
the
council's
review
council
you're
the
council
welcome
to
our
store
we're
closed
now
i'll
be
in
the
back
what
review
quinton
let's
just
stop
a
moment
and
talk
about
this
miss
excuse
me
you
uh
you
work
here
yes
i
do
ever
since
i
moved
here
from
southeastern
indiana
where
i
was
raised
by
both
a
mother
and
a
father
anya
just
go
you
don't
have
to
talk
to
him
she
works
for
me
now
tell
me
about
this
review
no
one
said
anything
to
me
about
this
let's
sit
down
and
talk
about
it
over
here
you
all
stand
around
and
look
somber
good
job
you
used
to
respect
us
giles
you
used
to
be
one
of
us
you
used
to
pay
me
if
you
recall
firing
me
was
not
my
idea
touche
but
you
were
on
the
inside
once
you
know
what
sort
of
resources
we
command
we've
discovered
information
about
this
creature
your
glory
some
of
it
is
clearly
vital
the
rest
merely
extremely
disturbing
and
it
won't
be
handed
over
until
we're
convinced
that
you
and
your
slayer
are
prepared
for
it
thus
the
review
i'm
not
having
you
put
her
through
another
one
of
your
insane
tests
it's
not
a
test
it's
a
check
of
her
methods
we
need
to
know
that
this
information
is
safe
you
can
trust
her
buffy's
come
very
far
recently
she's
acquired
a
remarkable
focus
now
rasputin
was
associated
with
a
certain
obscure
religious
sect
they
held
the
tenet
that
in
order
to
be
forgiven
one
first
had
to
sin
rasputin
embraced
this
doctrine
and
proceeded
to
sin
impressively
and
repeatedly
the
notion
that
he
was
in
fact
evil
gained
strength
years
later
when
the
conspirators
who
set
out
to
kill
him
found
it
nearly
impossible
to
do
so
nearly
impossible
i'm
sorry
there's
a
question
miss
summers
of
course
i
uh
about
you
know
killing
him
you
know
they
they
poisoned
him
and
and
they
beat
him
and
they
shot
him
and
he
didn't
die
until
they
rolled
his
body
in
a
carpet
and
drowned
him
in
a
canal
but
there
are
reported
sightings
of
him
as
late
as
the
1930s
aren't
there
i
can
assure
you
there
is
near
consensus
in
the
academic
community
regarding
the
death
of
rasputin
there
was
also
near
consensus
about
columbus
you
know
until
someone
asked
the
vikings
what
they
were
up
to
in
the
1400s
and
they're
like
'discovering
this
americashaped
continent'
i
just
i'm
only
saying
you
know
it
might
be
interesting
if
we
came
at
it
from
you
know
a
different
perspective
that's
all
well
i'm
sorry
if
you
find
these
facts
so
boring
miss
summers
maybe
you'd
prefer
i
step
aside
so
that
you
can
teach
your
own
course
speculation
101
perhaps
intro
to
flights
of
fancy
i
only
meant
professor
what
was
it
you
were
going
on
about
last
week
mysterious
sleeping
patterns
of
the
prussian
generals
now
some
of
us
are
here
to
learn
believe
it
or
not
we're
interested
in
finding
out
what
actually
happened
it's
called
studying
history
you
can
sit
down
now
unless
you
have
something
else
to
add
professor
miss
summers
some
of
us
are
here
to
learn
professor
maybe
you'd
like
to
teach
your
own
class
who
are
you
talking
to
spike
why
did
you
do
that
not
for
money
if
that's
what
you're
thinking
your
heartfelt
gratitude's
plenty
i
expect
i'll
be
getting
that
any
moment
gratitude
for
getting
in
my
way
gegetting
in
your
way
i
saved
you
i
was
regrouping
you
were
about
to
be
regrouped
into
separate
piles
you
needed
help
i
didn't
need
you
i
never
need
you
spike
oh
i
get
it
you
just
don't
like
who
did
the
rescuin'
that's
all
wishin'
i
was
your
boyfriend
what'shisface
oh
wait
he's
run
off
you
know
what
i
don't
need
a
boyfriend
to
rescue
me
or
for
any
other
reason
don't
need
or
can't
keep
you
keep
making
notches
in
the
headboard
but
eventually
they
get
up
out
of
the
bed
and
run
off
don't
they
you're
disgusting
oh
rough
talk
maybe
that's
your
problem
maybe
you
push
'em
away
or
is
it
the
other
maybe
you
cling
too
much
or
maybe
your
beauty's
fading
the
stress
of
slaying
aging
you
prematurely
things
not
as
high
not
as
firm
you
know
what
spike
the
more
i
get
to
know
you
the
more
i
wish
i
didn't
or
maybe
you
just
don't
hold
their
interest
begging
permission
to
speak
with
you
sir
don't
touch
me
you're
crusty
what
do
you
want
oh
not
me
the
magnificent
glory
she
wants
she
wants
more
information
on
the
slayer
she
knows
you
know
her
the
slayer
i
don't
know
any
slayer
get
away
from
me
you
shouldn't
be
here
oh
i
believe
you
do
sir
she's
short
symmetrical
hair
on
top
buffy
something
buffy
summers
is
the
slayer
that's
the
one
very
clever
of
you
sir
the
slayer
how
does
glory
know
this
i
do
not
know
i
was
not
there
but
the
beauteous
glory
said
for
you
to
tell
us
please
where
her
dwelling
is
who
her
friends
are
why
so
glory
can
find
her
do
something
to
her
why
would
i
do
that
i
don't
know
sir
she
just
said
to
tell
you
to
do
it
for
her
that
was
her
message
well
i've
got
a
message
for
glory
too
we've
been
developing
sort
of
a
a
hybrid
fighting
style
let
me
outline
her
progress
for
you
and
ii
think
you'll
see
that
your
review
isn't
strictly
needed
bad
day
bad
baaad
miss
summers

good
to
see
you
again
mr
travers
giles
has
just
been
telling
us
of
your
training
regimen
perhaps
you'll
favor
us
with
a
demonstration
while
we're
here
right
now
no
need
to
rush
you
they're
staying
a
little
longer
than
i'd
anticipated
we've
already
laid
out
our
project
for
mr
giles
nigel
it's
an
exhaustive
examination
of
your
procedures
and
abilities
we'll
observe
your
training
talk
to
your
friends
talk
to
my
friends
yes
we
understand
you're
still
taking
civilians
out
on
patrols
oh
you've
gotta
be
kidding
me
buffy
i
can
sense
your
resistance
and
i
don't
blame
you
but
i
think
your
watcher
hasn't
reminded
you
lately
of
the
resolute
status
of
the
players
in
our
little
game
the
council
fights
evil
the
slayer
is
the
instrument
by
which
we
fight
the
council
remains
the
slayers
change
it's
been
that
way
from
the
beginning
giles
well
that's
a
very
comforting
bloodless
way
of
looking
at
it
isn't
it
giles
let
me
talk
to
buffy
because
i
think
she's
understanding
me
glory
is
stronger
than
you
she's
a
more
powerful
instrument
if
you
will
we
can
help
you
we
have
information
that
will
help
pass
the
review
and
we
give
it
to
you
without
reservation
fail
the
review
either
through
incompetence
or
by
resisting
our
recommendations
resisting
your
recommendations
she
fails
if
we
don't
do
whatever
you
say
how
much
under
your
thumb
do
you
think
we
are
how
much
do
you
want
our
help
she's
not
your
bloody
instrument
and
you
have
no
right
to
do
any
of
this
giles
i
understand
you
think
this
is
unfair
but
there
are
factors
which
should
motivate
you
to
go
along
with
the
review
now
i
don't
want
to
do
this
but
obviously
we
could
shut
this
place
down
permanently
you
can't
do
that
you
don't
have
that
kind
of
power
of
course
we
do
and
a
great
deal
more
in
fact
if
you
insist
on
fighting
us
we'll
arrange
to
have
mr
giles
deported
within
the
day
never
set
foot
in
this
country
again
now
perhaps
you're
used
to
idle
threats
and
sloppy
discipline
miss
summers
but
you're
dealing
with
grownups
now
am
i
making
myself
clear
jinx
hey
what's
the
deal
with
your
face
it's
a
message
from
ben
he
isn't
going
to
help
isn't
go
isn't
going
to
help
no
all
he
has
to
do
is
turn
over
that
tiny
squirming
slayer
girl
i
have
business
to
do
with
her
if
she
knows
where
i
can
start
looking
for
my
key
aah
why
won't
he
help
he
knows
her
he
could
go
to
her
he
could
talk
to
her

he
could
seduce
her
and
bang
the
key
out
of
her
he
is
quite
attractive
well
of
course
he's
attractive
but
he
drives
me
insane
know
what
i
mean
he
drives
you
insane
yeah
that's
it
exactly
oh
sweet
lumpy
minion
you're
the
only
one
that
understands
probably
cause
i
haven't
sucked
your
brain
out
yet
he
makes
me
so
mad
if
i
could
just
get
my
hands
on
him
you
know
i'll
just
find
her
myself
it's
a
power
play
that's
what
it
is
it's
about
who
has
the
power
i'm
guessing
they
do
big
power
outage
in
buffy
county
i
should
have
set
you
loose
on
them
that's
what
i
should
have
done
giles
that
travers
guy
is
like
sixty
i
can't
hit
him
can
i
i
suppose
not
well
i
could
i
think
i
will
can
they
really
do
the
stuff
they
threatened
kick
you
out
the
country
in
a
heartbeat
see
the
rough
stuff
they're
all
right
out
there
a
bit
hamhanded
but
they
get
it
done
but
uh
this
stuff
the
uh
bureaucracy
the
pulling
of
political
strings
they're
the
best
in
the
world
they
can
kill
you
with
the
stroke
of
a
pen
poncy
sods
am
i
gonna
be
able
to
get
through
this
review
well
i
i
suppose
they'll
make
it
as
difficult
as
they
want
to
the
physical
stuff
could
be
a
bit
of
a
challenge
that's
not
what
i'm
worried
about
it's
the
other
stuff
examining
decisions
i've
made
i
mean
twice
now
i've
been
within
slaying
distance
of
glory
and
twice
she's
kicked
my
ass
without
even
tensing
a
muscle
and
i
haven't
been
able
to
figure
out
what
she
is
or
anything
about
her
except
that
she
wants
the
key
which
i
have
and
i
can't
even
figure
out
if
it's
okay
for
me
to
tell
anyone
that
buffy
no
one
could
have
done
any
better
than
you
but
no
one
else
is
gonna
be
asked
the
questions
that
i
can't
answer
they're
gonna
expect
me
to
to
be
like
a
slayer
and
and
know
stuff
but
i'm
just
me
and
i
don't
know
anything
and
they're
gonna
go
away
and
they're
not
gonna
tell
me
how
to
fight
glory
and
i'm
not
gonna
be
able
to
protect
dawn
buffy
calm
down
the
scandal
here
is
not
anything
you've
done
wrong
it's
the
way
they're
behaving
holding
what
they
know
hostage
with
a
gun
pointed
at
my
bleeding
green
card
no
less
it's
humiliating
also
smart
they
picked
the
perfect
thing
i
can't
lose
you
thank
you
i
guess
i
should
be
getting
ready
what
do
you
think
it'll
be
like
i
mean
how
do
you
think
they'll
start
anya
christina
emanuella
jenkins
twenty
years
old
born
on
the
fourth
of
july
and
don't
think
there
weren't
jokes
about
that
my
whole
life
mister
'cause
there
were
'who's
our
little
patriot'
they'd
say
when
i
was
younger
and
therefore
smaller
and
shorter
than
i
am
now
so
you
spell
it
anya
yes
yes
fine
now
we
can
get
to
the
questions
questions
great
well
we
can
answer
questions
good
i
need
to
know
a
little
bit
more
about
the
slayer
and
about
the
both
of
you
your
relationship
whatever
you
can
tell
me
ooour
relationship
we're
friends
good
friends
girlfriends
actually
yes
we're
girlfriends
we're
in
love
we're
lovers
we're
lesbian
gaytype
lovers
i
meant
your
relationship
with
the
slayer
um
just
good
friends
best
friends
willow
and
me
and
buffy
the
three
of
us
have
been
together
from
the
beginning
we've
always
gone
on
patrols
and
uh
done
demon
research
with
her
and
everything
have
you
mastered
any
fighting
disciplines
over
the
years
no
so
you
have
no
special
skills
or
powers
or
knowledge
that
you
bring
to
the
mix
neither
of
you
just
enthusiasm
for
killing
the
demons
go
deadness
for
the
demons
i
don't
have
any
powers
but
i
do
help
how
be
specific
last
year
uh
willow
giles
and
me
combined
our
essences
with
buffy
which
isn't
as
weird
as
it
sounds
we
merged
and
i
was
the
heart
part
of
a
superbuffy
again
let
me
stress
the
notasweird
thing
i'm
told
it
was
all
very
professional
are
you
saying
that
the
slayer
needs
that
level
of
help
from
you
often
no
no
she
doesn't
need
help
she'd
be
fine
without
us
sometimes
she
goes
off
and
does
stuff
without
even
telling
us
not
that
she's
like
a
a
weird
loner
or
anything
i'm
not
sure
we're
saying
this
right
see
here's
the
thing
we
we
can
help
because
we
do
magicks
i'm
working
on
this
ball
of
sunshine
thing
see
i
have
this
theory
it's
very
cool
aand
if
it
works
easier
slaying
for
buffy
not
that
it's
hard
for
her
now
interesting
what
level
are
you
at
level
magical
proficiency
level
oh
uh
high
a
high
level
very
high
one
of
those
top
levels
five
and
you're
registered
as
practicing
witches
under
the
names
as
you
gave
them
to
me
rregistered
oh
yes
yes
of
course
we're
tara
rrregistered
do
either
of
you
know
anything
about
the
key
nope
but
it
sounds
demony
to
me
i
don't
hold
with
that
demon
nonsense
muffin
i
cooked
them
myself
so
buffy
sometimes
protects
you
from
the
dangerous
elements
of
her
work
yes
she's
saved
my
life
lots
of
times
the
vampires
in
this
town
hate
her
but
we
understand
that
you
help
the
slayer
i
pitch
in
when
she
pays
me
she
pays
you
she
gives
you
money
money
a
little
nip
of
blood
out
of
some
stray
victim
whatever
blood
well
if
they're
gonna
die
anyway
come
to
think
of
it
though
that's
a
bit
scandalous
isn't
it
personally
i'm
shocked
the
girl's
slipping
you've
noticed
a
decline
in
her
work
oh
yeah
see
the
poor
little
twig
can't
keep
a
man
gets
her
all
down
few
more
disappointments
she'll
be
cryin'
on
my
shoulder
mark
my
words
is
that
what
you
want
i'd
think
you'd
want
to
kill
her
you've
killed
slayers
before
heard
of
me
have
you
i
wrote
my
thesis
on
you
well
well
isn't
that
neat
tell
me
pet
now
we're
such
good
friends
how's
the
slayer
doing
is
she
okay
high
marks
in
all
categories
agility
clarity
stamina
and
strength
cut
to
the
workout
room
in
the
back
of
the
magic
shop
nigel
is
tying
a
blindfold
around
buffy's
head
giles
and
the
other
watchers
are
standing
around
these
are
the
qualities
that
the
slayer
must
possess
to
do
her
job
what
came
after
agility
if
you
want
her
to
attack
the
dummy
travers
no
no
philip
will
attack
the
dummy
the
slayer's
job
is
to
protect
it
do
you
understand
protect
the
dummy
as
if
it
were
precious
now
getting
the
best
of
philip
will
require
agility
listening
to
my
instructions
at
the
same
time
that
will
demonstrate
clarity
and
stamina
and
strength
will
win
the
long
fight
good
luck
instructions
yeah
i'll
be
telling
you
what
to
do
how
to
counter
philip's
attack
we
assume
you're
familiar
with
the
japanese
names
for
aikido
and
jiujitsu
moves
japanese
and
go
whoa
hold
on
a
second
we
uh
you
know
in
america
we
usually
just
work
our
way
up
to
'go'
philip
bows
toward
buffy
he's
holding
a
short
axe
huh
he
wants
you
to
bow
take
a
bow
oh
punch
him
thanks
giles
sorry
uhback
kick
elbow
buffy
backkicks
and
philip
moves
out
of
the
way
she
thrusts
with
her
elbow
and
he
avoids
it
elbowstrike
how
have
you
been
training
her
i've
trained
her
to
win
you
know
what
i'm
gonna
have
to
do
it
my
way
guys
uhoh
i
think
she
just
broke
my
rib
yes
well
i
didn't
mean
to
um
you
know
i
i
can
do
better
i
think
i
might
be
getting
this
like
inner
ear
thing
and
so
maybe
maybe
if
i
got
a
note
i
i
could
try
again
no
that's
all
right
i
don't
think
we
need
to
see
any
more
physical
tests
for
a
while
we
can
move
on
to
the
real
review
look
into
your
strategies
plans
figure
out
what's
going
on
in
that
head
good
head
stuff
we
start
at
seven
tonight
give
you
time
to
uh

well
however
you
prepare
mom
long
day
sweetie
so
this
is
where
the
slayer
eats
sleeps
and
combs
her
hair
oh
so
cute
i
can't
even
stand
it
personally
i
need
more
space
but
uh
this
is
good
for
you
it's
it's
so
quaint
and
buffy
if
i
wanted
to
fight
you
could
tell
by
the
being
dead
already
so
play
nice
little
girl
what
do
you
want
the
key
why
else
do
you
think
i'd
come
here
see
i
think
you
knew
where
it
is
and
that's
a
good
thing
i'm
glad
you
think
so
well
it's
the
only
thing
keeping
you
alive
right
now
because
you
may
be
tiny
queen
in
vampire
world
but
to
me
you're
a
bug
you
should
get
down
on
your
knees
and
worship
me
but
oh
no
you
still
think
it's
neat
having
slayer
strength
ooh
big
deal
stronger
than
humans
who
isn't
i
could
crush
the
life
from
you
as
easy
as
you'd
break
a
nail
but
i
need
the
key

this
is
a
onetimeonly
deal
next
time
we
meet
something
you
love
dies
bloody
you
know
you
can't
take
me
you
know
you
can't

buffy

that
pack

the
slayer

i
was
worried
so
what's

the
family
outing
i
need
your
help
great
i
need
your
cash
i'm
serious
you
have
to
look
after
them
well
that's
a
boatload
of
manly
responsibility
to
come
flying
out
of
nowhere
what's
the
matter
slayer
you're
not
feeling
a
hundred
percent
no
they
didn't
put
a
chip
in
your
head
did
they
no
be
funny
if
they
did
spike
i
need
an
answer
now
in
or
out
you're
the
only
one
strong
enough
to
protect
them
all
right
then
ladies
come
on
in
there's
plenty
of
blood
in
the
fridge
do
you
mean
like
real
blood
what
do
you
think
mostly
i
think
'ew'
buffy
keep
dawn
here
as
long
as
you
can
i'll
be
back
soon
okay
i
don't
think
i
need
to
remind
you
but
spike
yeah
yeah
'anything
happens
to
'em
i'll
stake
you
good
and
proper'
sing
me
a
new
one
sometime
eh
that
bit's
gone
stale
i
i
love
what
you've
um
neglected
to
do
with
the
place
just
don't
break
anything
and
don't
make
a
lot
of
noise
passions
is
coming
on
passions
oh
do
you
think
timmy's
really
dead
oh
no
no
she
can
just
sew
him
back
together
he's
a
doll
for
god's
sake
uh
what
about
the
wedding
i
mean
there's
no
way
they're
gonna
go
through
with
that
look
at
them
big
tough
council
members
pickin'
on
the
books
fascists
why
doesn't
mr
giles
put
them
all
out
of
here
because
if
they
deport
him
they're
not
just
destroying
his
career
they're
condemning
the
man
to
a
lifetime
diet
of
blood
sausage
bangers
and
mash
well
your
slayer's
twenty
minutes
late
and
counting
rupert
buffy
will
be
here
i
assure
you
yes
but
when
crap
uh
guys
aany
way
we
could
not
do
this
okay
let's
see
what
you
are
or
who
you
are
one
soldier
in
a
vast
army
what
army
the
knights
of
byzantium
an
ancient
order
and
now
your
enemy
you
work
for
glory
you
think
we
align
ourselves
with
the
beast
you
must
be
mad
you're
the
ones
tried
killing
me
no
we
were
fools
three
alone
but
if
it
takes
a
hundred
men
we
send
a
hundred
men
and
if
it
takes
a
thousand
we
send
a
thousand
a
thousand
so
long
as
you
protect
the
key
the
brotherhood
will
never
stop
until
we
destroy
it
and
you
you
are
the
slayer
and
we
know
what
we
must
do
now
be
done
with
it
kill
us
and
let
legions
follow
go
you're
late
yeah
was
was
there
an
attack
yeah
we
can
begin
the
review
at
last
we'll
uh
skip
the
more
obvious
questions
there
isn't
gonna
be
a
review
sorry
no
review
no
interrogation
no
questions
you
know
i
can't
answer
no
hoops
no
jumps

and
no
interruptions
see
i've
had
a
lot
of
people
talking
at
me
the
last
few
days
everyone
just
lining
up
to
tell
me
how
unimportant
i
am
and
i've
finally
figured
out
why
power
i
have
it
they
don't
this
bothers
them
glory
came
to
my
home
today
buffy
are
you
buffy
just
to
talk
she
told
me
i'm
a
bug
i'm
a
flea
she
could
squash
me
in
a
second
only
she
didn't
she
came
into
my
home
and
we
talked
we
had
what
in
her
warped
brain
probably
passes
for
a
civilized
conversation
why
because
she
needs
something
from
me
because
i
have
power
over
her
you
guys
didn't
come
all
the
way
from
england
to
determine
whether
or
not
i
was
good
enough
to
be
let
back
in
you
came
to
beg
me
to
let
you
back
in
to
give
your
jobs
your
lives
some
semblance
of
meaning
this
is
beyond
insolence
buffy
grabs
the
sword
from
the
table
and
throws
it
across
the
room
in
a
single
movement
it
flies
pointfirst
into
the
wall
directly
in
front
of
nigel's
nose
he
jumps
back
looking
shocked
i'm
fairly
certain
i
said
no
interruptions
that
was
excellent
you're
watchers
without
a
slayer
you're
pretty
much
just
watchin'
masterpiece
theater
you
can't
stop
glory
you
can't
do
anything
with
the
information
you
have
except
maybe
publish
it
in
the
'everyone
thinks
we're
insaneo's
home
journal'
so
here's
how
it's
gonna
work
you're
gonna
tell
me
everything
you
know
then
you're
gonna
go
away
you'll
contact
me
if
and
when
you
have
any
further
information
about
glory
the
magic
shop
will
remain
open
mr
giles
will
stay
here
as
my
official
watcher
reinstated
at
full
salary
retroactive
to
be
paid
retroactively
from
the
month
he
was
fired
i
will
continue
my
work
with
the
help
of
my
friends
i
uh
i
don't
want
a
sword
thrown
at
me
but
but
civilians
i
we're
talking
about
children
we're
talking
about
two
very
powerful
witches
and
a
thousandyearold
exdemon
willow's
a
demon
the
boy
no
power
there
the
boy
has
clocked
more
field
time
than
all
of
you
combined
he's
part
of
the
unit
that's
rileyspeak
i've
clocked
field
time
now
you
all
may
be
very
good
at
your
jobs
the
only
way
we're
gonna
find
out
is
if
you
work
with
me
you
can
all
take
your
time
thinking
about
that
but
i
want
an
answer
right
now
from
quinton
'cause
i
think
he's
understanding
me
uh
your
terms
are
acceptable
see
no
biggie
uh
rupert
quinton
when
we
inventoried
your
shop
we
found
a
bottle
of
single
malt
scotch
behind
the
uh
incense
holders
well
it's
it's
not
you
know
during
working
hours
i
think
i
could
use
a
glass
well
i
suppose
we
could
just
a
minute
glory
i
wanna
