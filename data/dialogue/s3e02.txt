want
to
put
this
whole
thing
behind
us
get
back
to
normal
you
go
okay
didn't
anyone
ever
warn
you
about
playing
with
pointy
sticks
it's
all
fun
and
games
until
somebody
loses
an
eye
you
shouldn't
sneak
up
on
people
like
that
jeez
buff
come
in
nighthawk
everything
okay
nighthawk
ooh
oh
hey
buffy
hey
guys
you
know
imaybe
it's
too
late
maybe
we
should
just
come
back
tomorrow
what
if
he's
mad
mad
just
because
you
ran
away
and
abandoned
your
post
and
your
friends
and
your
mom
and
made
him
lay
awake
every
night
worrying
about
you
maybe
we
should
wait
out
here
check
it
out
the
watcher
is
back
on
the
clock
and
just
when
you
were
thinking
career
change
maybe
becoming
a
a
looker
or
a
a
seer
thank
you
xander
welcome
home
buffy
i
got
in
a
few
hours
ago
but
i
wanted
to
go
see
my
mom
first
yes
yes
of
course
how
how
did
you
find
her
well
i
pretty
much
remembered
the
address
ah
eh
i
mean
uh

how
are
things
between
you
ah
excuse
me
hey
so
you're
not
wanted
for
murder
anymore
good
that
was
such
a
drag
so
where
were
you
did
you
go
to
belgium
why
would
i
go
to
belgium
i
think
the
relevant
question
is
why
wouldn't
you
belgium
what
about
you
xander
what's
up
with
you
oh
you
know
same
old
same
old
hardly
okay
i
lied
a
whole
lot
is
new
well
that's
good
isn't
it
new
is
good
oh
yeah
absolutely
except
for
the
obvious
it's
not
too
much

yeah
'cause
you
weren't
at
the
hotel
cordelia's
parents
dragged
her
onto
a
luxury
vacation
i
feel
for
you
here
we
are
then
cheer
us
up
so
were
you
like
living
in
a
box
or
what
well
it's
a
long
story
so
skip
the
heartwarming
stuff
about
kindly
old
people
and
saving
the
farm
and
get
right
to
the
dirt
perhaps
buffy
could
use
a
little
time
to
adjust
before
we
grill
her
on
her
summer
activities
what
he
said
fair
enough
in
fact
you
can
leave
the
slaying
to
us
while
you
settle
in
we
got
you
covered
i
noticed
you
guys
seem
down
with
the
slayage
all
tricked
out
with
your
walkies
and
everything
yeah
but
the
outfits
suck
this
whole
rambo
thing
is
so
over
i'm
thinking
more
sporty
like
hilfiger
maybe
still
we
were
getting
good
we
dusted
nine
out
of
ten
six
out
of
ten
six
out
of
ten
whatever
we
were
kicking
a
little
undead
booty
well
thank
you
for
the
offer
but
i
think
i
just
wanna
get
back
to
my
normal
routine
you
know
school
slaying
kid's
stuff
in
fact
i'm
jonesing
for
a
little
brainless
fun
what
are
you
doing
tomorrow
oh
i
would
but
uh
you
wish
will
um
tomorrow
i
buffy
oh
come
on
friends
don't
let
friends
browse
alone
okay
i
had
some
schoolwork
but
i
can
change
my
plans
as
for
school
buffy
uh
you
know
you'll
have
to
talk
to
principal
snyder
before
buffy
on
it
mom
is
making
an
appointment
with
his
ugliness
i
know
she
can
break
him
absolutely
not
under
no
circumstances
but
you
can't
keep
her
out
of
school
you
don't
have
the
right
i
have
not
only
the
right
but
also
a
nearly
physical
sensation
of
pleasure
at
the
thought
of
keeping
her
out
of
school
i'd
describe
myself
as
tingly
buffy
was
cleared
of
all
those
charges
yes
and
while
she
may
live
up
to
the
notamurderer
requirement
for
enrollment
she
is
a
troublemaker
destructive
to
school
property
and
the
occasional
student
and
her
grade
point
average
is
enough
to

i'm
sorry
another
tingle
moment
i
don't
see
how
you
can
be
so
cavalier
about
a
young
girl's
entire
future
i'm
quite
sure
that
a
girl
with
the
talents
and
abilities
of
buffy
will
land
on
her
feet
in
fact
i
noticed
as
i
came
in
this
morning
that
hot
dog
on
a
stick
is
hiring
you
will
look
so
cute
in
that
hat
let's
go
mom
this
isn't
over
if
i
have
to
i'll
go
all
the
way
to
the
mayor
wouldn't
that
be
interesting
don't
worry
about
school
honey
if
we
can't
get
you
back
into
sunnydale
maybe
we
can
swing
private
school
private
school
you
mean
like
jackets
and
kilts
you
want
me
to
get
field
hockey
knees

not
that
bad

just
for
scary
religious
people
anymore
we'll
work
something
out

i
dreaming
i'm
probably
the
wrong
person
to
ask
you'd

i'm
afraid
you

be
i've
been
on
the
phone
with
the
uh
superintendent
of

some
bad
choices
you
just
might
have
to

some
consequences
nothing's
settled
yet
i
just
wish
you
didn't
have
to
be
so
secretive
about

i
mean
it's
not
your
fault
you
have
a
special
circumstance
they
should
make
allowances
for
you
mom
i'm
a
slayer
it's
not
like
i
need
to
ride
a
little
bus
to
school
couldn't
you
just
tell
a
few
people
like
principal
snyder
and
maybe
the
police
i
mean
i
would
think
they
would
be
happy
to
have
a
a
superhero
is
that
the
right
term
i
mean
it's
not
offensive
is
it
welcome
to
the
hellmouth
petting
zoo
oh
my
god

a
stench
you
know
i
wanted
forest
pine
or
april

i'll
get
it

giles
don't
you

anything
regular
golf
usa
today
or
anything
i'm
trying
to
find
out
how

why
it
rose
from
the
grave
it's
not
as
if
i'm
going
to
take
it
home
and
offer
it
a
saucer
of
warm
milk
well
i
like

i
think
you

patches
what
about
buffy's
welcome
home
dinner
tonight
i
had
told
her
mom
we'd
help
out
bring
stuff
i'm
the
dip
uh
you
gotta
admire
the
purity
of
it
what
onion
dip
stirring
not
cooking
it's
what
i
bring
we
should
figure
out
what
kinda
deal
this
is
i
mean
is
it
aa
gathering
a
shindig
or
a
hootenanny
what's
the
difference
well
a
gathering
is
brie
mellow
song
stylings
shindig
dip
less
mellow
song
stylings
perhaps
a
large
amount
of
malt
beverage
and
hootenanny
well
it's
chock
full
of
hoot
just
a
little
bit
of
nanny
well
i
hate
brie
i
know
it
smells
like
giles's
cat
it's
not
my
xander
and
what'll
we
talk
about
at
a
gathering
anyway
'so
buffy
did
you
meet
any
nice
pimps
on
your
travels
and
oh
by
the
by
thanks
for
ruining
our
lives
for
the
past
three
months'
willow
xander
you
know
what
i
mean
she
doesn't
want
to
talk
about
it
we
don't
want
to
talk
about
it
so
why
don't
we
just
shut
up
and
dance
well
buffy
said
she
did
want
to
loosen
up
you
know
have
some
kid
time
aren't
you
guys
rehearsing
tonight
why
don't
you
play
at
the
party
yeah
i
think
i
could
supply
some
dingo
action
uh
ii'm
not
sure
that
a
a
um
shindig

hootenanny
hhootenanny
iiis
really
the
order
of
the
day
uh
uh
it
should
maybe
something
a
little
more
intimate
iii
mean
buffy
has
just
got
home
i'm
i'm
sure
she's
still
feeling
a
little
disoriented
all
the
more
reason
to
make
her
feel
welcome
aand
a
big
party
says
'welcome
buffy'
xander
slaps
giles
on
the
back
giles
turns
to
give
him
a
look
okay
so
one
vote
from
the
old
guy
for
a
smelly
cheese
night
and
how
many
votes
for
actual
fun
huh
alright
alright
have
it
your
way
i'm
just
glad
to
have
her
home
now
things
can
get
back
to
normal
hey
there
you
are
not
thinking
about
any
more
flights
of
fancy
i
hope
joyce
said
there
was
room
for
one
more
so
i
said
forget
facial
night
and
let's
party
i
bet
you
like
empanadas
do
you
want
to
see
my
mom
please
mom
oh
pat
good
buffy
i
hope
you
don't
mind
hi
you
look
great
hey
buffy
so
where
do
you
want
the
band
to
set
up
whthe
band
hey
hey
you
can
send
me
a
savior
buffy
this
is
large
you
like
that
lives
till
the
end
of
time
buffy
yeah
it's
great
ii
was
just
sort
of
hoping
it
would
be
us
time
willow
sorry
what
the
promise
of
heaven
buffy
this
is
amazing
but
i
was
sort
of
hoping
we
could
just
hang
together
the
gang
but
that
only
leaves
me
dry
willow
indicates
to
the
band
and
makes
like
she
totally
can't
hear
buffy
she
turns
her
attention
back
to
oz
and
smiles
at
him
dry
buffy
senses
that
willow
is
more
into
watching
oz
play
with
the
band
than
anything
else
at
the
moment
and
decides
to
leave
her
alone
too
many
saviors
and
i
won't
die
after
walking
a
ways
back
into
the
crowd
buffy
changes
her
mind
deciding
that
she
wants
to
talk
to
willow
now
i
never
cried
but
i
needed
more
from
you
she
touches
willow
on
the
arm
and
indicates
they
should
go
someplace
to
talk
willow
lets
buffy
lead
her
away
through
the
crowd
i
found
my
life
without
you
now
buffy
finds
a
relatively
quiet
spot
in
the
dining
room
where
they
can
talk
and
i
never
mind
i'm
only
half
as
blind
buffy
is
everything
okay
cause
i
needed
more
from
you
buffy
you
you
seem
to
be
avoiding
me
iin
the
oneonone
sense
what
and
i
never
mind
willow
this
isn't
avoiding
see
here
you
are
here
i
am
i'm
only
half
as
blind
buffy
so
we're
cool
cause
i
needed
more
from
you
willow
way
that's
why
with
the
party
'cause
we're
all
glad
you're
back
okay
okay
good
you
say
my
reflection
never
fades
from
your
eyes
cut
to
joyce's
bedroom
the
mask's
eyes
begin
to
glow
a
deep
red
again
i
got
another
rope
over
me
but
i
won't
hang
i
can
feel
you
covet
my
faith
cut
to
xander
and
cordelia
sucking
some
serious
face
by
the
stairs
i
said
another
lie
i
know
why
i
don't
wanna
sway
buffy
comes
walking
out
of
the
crowd
and
sees
them
she
tries
to
walk
by
without
being
noticed
but
xander
sees
her
cordelia
doesn't
stop
kissing
him
on
the
face
and
neck
while
he
talks
to
buffy
hey
buff
uh
what
are
you
doing
i
was
just
taking
a
break
from
all
this
wacky
fun
i
don't
wanna
sway
xander
some
kind
of
party
huh
i
guess
a
lot
of
people
are
glad
to
have
you
back
it
seems
like
people
i
didn't
even
know
missed
me
did
giles
say
he
was
going
to
be
late
seize
these
worlds
or
never
live
again
xander
uh
he
was
library
man
last
time
i
saw
him
but
he'll
be
here
he
wants
to
celebrate
your
homecoming
we
all
do
i
mean
it's
great
to
have
the
buffster
back
seize
these
worlds
xander
isn't
it
totally
or
never
live
again
cordelia
except
you
were
kinda
turning
me
on
with
that
whole
boy
slayer
look
was
i
now
you
bet
nighthawk
well
i'll
just
be
uh

oh
yeah
breathe
breathe
alright
look
these
burns
are
too
extensive
it's
743
let's
call
it
oh
my
god
you
know
i
roll
it
over
in
my
head
a
guy
reaches
in
front
of
her
and
grabs
a
handful
of
party
mix
leans
his
head
back
and
dumps
it
into
his
mouth
most
of
it
spills
to
the
sides
and
onto
the
floor
i
won't
feel
you
covet
my
faith
buffy
just
gives
a
shrug
grabs
a
few
more
cups
and
turns
to
go
throw
them
out
she
passes
two
guys
talking
and
overhears
their
conversation
hey
what's
the
deal
with
this
party
anyway
you've
said
another
lie

pat
bends
down
to
pick
up
the
mask
and
holds
it
to
her
face
as
she
stands
back
up
the
eyes
suddenly
glow
a
very
bright
red
and
the
mask
integrates
itself
into
pat's
face
the
zombie
immediately
stops
fighting
willow
and
falls
to
his
knees
screaming
and
cowering
before
ovu
mobani
incarnate
generally
speaking
when
scary
things
get
scared
not
good
i
live
you
die
willow
don't

out
back
not

an
appointment
i'd
like

have
a
word
with
you
if
that
word
is
buffy
then
i
have
two
words
for
you
'good'
and
'riddance'
now
if
you
don't
mind
i
have
an
appointment
with
the
mayor
you
can't
keep
her
out
of
this
school
i
think
you'll
find
i
can
you
had
no
grounds
for
expelling
her
i
have
grounds
i
have
precedent
and
a
tingly
kind
of
feeling
buffy
summers
is
a
minor
and
is
entitled
to
a
public
education
your
personal
dislike
of
the
girl
does
not
legally
entitle
you
to
why
don't
you
take
it
up
with
the
city
council
i
thought
i'd
start
with
the
state
supreme
court
you're
powerful
in
local
circles
but
i
believe
i
can
make
life
very
difficult
for
you
professionally
speaking
and
buffy
will
be
allowed
back
in
sorry
i'm
not
convinced
would
you
like
me
to
convince
you
i
mean
i'm
not
a
fullfledged
witch

teeny
glamour

zit

tried
to
communicate
with
the
spirit
world

ready
for

being
pulled
apart
inside
