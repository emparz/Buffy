just
i
just
started
underlining
all
the
pages
i
really
wanted

i
don't

went
over
to
his
place
he
was
acting
well
very
antigiles
he
wouldn't
let
me
in
and
he
looked
really
bad
ii
think
he
might've
been
i
think
he
was
drinking
he
was
home
alone
drinking
but
tea
right
wasn't
tea
will
yep
yep
i
knew
this
would
happen
nobody
can
be
wound
as
straight
and
narrow
as
giles
without
a
dark
side
erupting
my
uncle
roary
was
the
stodgiest
taxidermist
you've
ever
met
by
day
by
night
it
was
booze
whores
and
fur
flying
were
there
whores
he
was
alone
give
it
time
so
none
of
you
guys
have
noticed
anything
different
lately
no
not
really
uh
you
haven't
seen
anything
weird
nope
no
he
seemed
perfectly
normal
yesterday
when
i
saw
him
talking
to
the
police
and
you
waited
till
now
to
tell
us
this
because
i
didn't
think
it
was
important
we
understand
it
wasn't
about
you
well
what
were
the
police
talking
to
him
about
oh

from
dead
guys
attacking

i
care
from
you
lost
weekending
in
your
apartment
i
wasn't
i
was
just
trying
to
find
a
solution
giles
share
what
is
the
mark
of
eyghon
hey
this
is
not
your
battle
and
as
your
watcher
i'm
telling
you
unequivocally
to
stay
out
of
it
i
have
to
get
jenny
home
mm
thank
you
we
have
work
to
do
will
i
want
you
to
find
out
anything
and
everything
you
can
about
the
mark
of
eyghon
i'll
try
the
'net
but
'mark
of
eyghon'
sounds
like
giles
and
his
books
sorta
deal
then
we
hit
the
books
xander
how
do
you
feel
about
digging
through
some
of
giles'
personal
files
and
seeing
what
you
can
find
i
feel
pretty
good
about
it
does
that
make
me
a
sociopath
what
what
about
me
i
care
about
giles
uh
work
with
xander
well
when
i
say
'care'
i
i
mean
cordelia
okay
okay
thanks
for
bringing
me
here
not
quite
ready
to
be
home
alone
just
yet
ooo
jenny
uh
i'm
so
very
sorry
about
all
of
this
i
uh
i
never
meant
for
you
to
be
involved
in
in
uh
any
of
this
so
i
got
involved
that's
what
happens
when
two
people
get
involved
i
really
am
however
gonna
have
to
get
you
home
it's
not
uh
i'm
not
a
very
safe
person
to
be
around
at
the
moment
nothing's
safe
in
this
world
rupert
don't
you
know
that
by
now
ah
aha
it's
not
egyptian
it's
etruscan
mistaken
for
egyptian
by
the
design
pattern
but
any
fool
can
see
it
predates
their
iconology
look
the
mark
of
eyghon
worn
by
his
initiates
'eyghon
also
called
the
sleepwalker
can
only
exist
in
this
reality
by
possessing
an
unconscious
host
temporary
possession
imbues
the
host
with
a
euphoric
feeling
of
power'
buffy
yeah
but
what
about
nontemporary
'unless
the
proper
rituals
are
observed
the
possession
is
permanent
and
eyghon
will
be
born
from
within
the
host'
cordelia
i'm
guessing
eww
wait
hey
listen
'once
called
eyghon
can
also
take
possession
of
the
dead
but
its
demonic
energy
soon
disintegrates
the
host
and
it
must
jump
to
the
nearest
dead
or
unconscious
person
to
continue
living'
buffy
i
still
don't
get
what
this
has
to
do
with
giles
i
don't
know
about
giles
but
ancient
sects
used
to
induce
possession
for
bacchanals
and
and
orgies
okay
giles
and
orgies
in
the
same
sentence
i
coulda
lived
without
that
one
uh
wait
a
minute
the
dead
guy's
all
puddly
now
so
the
demon's
gone
there
was
no
one
dead
to
jump
into
i
mean
we're
all
not
dead
right
no
no
one
dead
but
someone
unconscious
what
was
that
what
was
what
i
thought
i
heard
something
i
didn't
here
drink
that
and
then
i'll
drive
you
home
you
could
take
me
home
or
you
could
take
advantage
of
me
in
my
weakened
state
thank
you
operator
there's
no
answer
at
ms
calendar's
and
giles'
phone
is
out
of
order
i'm
gonna
go
over
there
jenny
uh
i'm
i'm
really
very
attracted
tto
you
good
but
um
now
really
isn't
the
right
time
oh
there's
never
been
a
better
time
it's
not
right
i
would
be
taking
advantage
god
you
just
don't
change
do
you
what
it's
not
right
it
wouldn't
be
proper
people

my
destiny
i
dropped
out
i
went
to
london

an
extraordinary
high
god

couldn't
control
it
one
of
us
randall

lost
control
eyghon
took
him
whole
we
tried
to
exorcise
the
demon
from
randall
but
it
killed
him
no
we
killed
him
we
thought
we
were
free
of
the
demon
after
that
but
now
he's
back

one
by
one
he
will
kill
us

grownup

find
out
that
you're
a
person
most
grownups
are
who
would've
thought
some
are
even
uh
shortsighted
foolish
people
so
after
all
this
time
we
finally
find
out
that
we
do
have
something
in
common
which
apart
from
being
a
little
weird
is
kind
of
okay

better

bay
city
rollers

music
