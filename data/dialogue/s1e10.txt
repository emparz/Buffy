of
um

looking
for
insane
about
what

of

unruffled
by

now
if

mm
it
was
pretty
intense
thank

center
of
mystical
convergence
supernatural
monsters

up
giles
maybe
he's
in
the
faculty
room
hey
giles
wakey
wakey
i
was
uh
in
the
stacks
i
got
lost
did
you
find
any
theories
on
spiders
coming
out
of
books
big
hairy
crawly
it's
funny
if
you're
me
i
couldn't
find
anything
uh
particularly
illuminating
um
i
think
perhaps
you'd
best
have
a
chat
with
wendell
himself
okay
if
he
can
still
talk
hey
wendell
how
are
you
huh
you
okay
good
talking
to
ya
man
do
you
guys
want
something
we
just
thought
you
might
wanna
talk
about
what
happened
you
know
yesterday
with
the
spiders
i
don't
know
what
to
say
about
that
there's
nothing
to
say
you
saw
two
hundred
insects
you
gonzoed
anybody
would
have
they're
not
insects
they're
arachnids
they're
from
the
middle
east
spiders
are
arachnids
they
have
eight
legs
insects
only
have
six
why
does
everyone
make
that
mistake
don't
know
has
anything
like
this
ever
happened
before
when
lots
of
times
ew
you
must
hate
spiders
more
than
i
do
i
don't
hate
spiders
i
love
'em
they
hate
me
i
hope
you
studied
for
the
history
test
what
history
test
the
one
we're
having
in
fourth
period
right
now
there's
a
history
test
nobody
told
me
there
was
a
history
test
i
haven't
i
okay
i
will
catch
up
with
you
guys
later
what
do
you
mean
you
love
spiders
it
is
platonic
right
i
had
the
best
collection
in
the
tricounty
area
browns
and
tarantulas
and
black
widows
then
my
folks
shipped
me
off
to
wilderness
camp
all
my
brother
had
to
do
was
maintain
their
habitats
instead
he
left
their
heat
lamp
on
for
a
week
when
i
came
home
they
were
all
dead
that's
when
the
nightmares
started
the
nightmares
it's
always
the
same
i'm
sitting
in
the
classroom
teacher
asks
me
to
read
something
i
open
up
my
book
and
then
there
they
are
they're
comin'
after
me
god
can
you
blame
them
after
what
i
did
and
that's
how
it
happens
every
time
yesterday
in
class
i
thought
i'd
just
nodded
off
again
but
then
everyone
else
started
screaming
too
you
don't
know
where
class
is
do
you
uh
hardly
a
shocker
you've
cut
history
just
about
every
time
we've
had
it
well
i
was
there
the
first
day
i
think
it's
in
here
i
haven't
been
to
class
i
haven't
read
any
of
the
assignments
how
am
i
gonna
pass
this
test
blind
luck
well
at
least
i
know
my
name
well
they
both
got
detention
which
is
completely
unfair
since
sean
started
it
anyway
it
means
we
can't
do
the
movie
i'm
gonna
take
a
break
you
shouldn't
go
in
there
lucky
nineteen
i
think

you
know
the
girl
to
say
hi
to
laura's
nice
enough
nobody
saw
who
attacked
her
well
i
was
rather
hoping
that
laura
did
hey
laura
hi
i
hope
we're
not
intruding
um
that's
okay
i
don't
wanna
be
left
alone
you
understand
we're
anxious
to
make
sure
this
this
doesn't
happen
again
can
you
tell
us
what
happened
i
was
in
the
basement
i
went
down
for
a
smoke
there
was
someone
there
someone
you
knew
i've
never
seen
anything
like
it
it
can
you
describe
it
hey
that's
okay
don't
worry
about
it
yes
you
you
you
just
rest
now
you
know
but
hi
laura
iif
you
remember
anything
you
can
tell
us
even
if
it
may
seem
weird
she
needs
her
rest
now
'lucky
nineteen'
buffy
and
giles
stop
and
turn
around
i'm
sorry
it's
what
he
said
right
before
he
said
'lucky
nineteen'
that's
weird
right
yes
yes
it
is
feel
better
take
care
doctor
is
she
gonna
be
alright
you
family
friends
she'll
recover
she's
got
a
couple
of
shattered
bones
a
little
internal
bleeding
she
got
off
pretty
easy
easy
have
you
looked
up
the
word
lately
well
the
first
one's
still
in
a
coma
first
what
first
victim
they
found
him
a
week
ago
exact
same
mo
as
the
girl
only
he's
in
worse
shape
if
he
doesn't
wake
up
soon
somebody's
gotta
stop
this
guy
somebody
will
listen
i'm
not
afraid
of
him
hey
if
he
wants
to
fight
then
i'm
takin'
him
down
i'm
not
backin'
off
on
this
this
is
about
honor
i'll
break
his
neck
i'm
just
saying
wendell
had
a
dream
and
then
that
exact
thing
happened
which
is
a
fair
wiggins
i
admit
but
do
you
think
that
ties
in
with
laura
i
dunno
maybe
she
dreamed
about
getting
beat
up
we
should
ask
buffy
when
she
gets
back
from
the
hospital
oh
there's
my
little
baby
mom
what
are
you
doing
here
mom
how's
my
little
pookie
mom
mom
please
don't
kiss
me
in
front
of
the
guys
it's
embarrassing
mom
please
you
cute
little
rascal
you
mom
thanks
but
mom
please
my
friends
are
right
here
it
could
be
a
coincidence
y'know
wendell
finds
a
spider's
nest
and
we
all
wig
because
he
dreamt
about
spiders
so
it
may
not
be
connected
if
there
is
a
connection
it
doesn't
sound
like
anything
what
xander
what
happened
to
your
iii
dunno
i
was
uh
dressed
a
minute
ago
it's
a
dream
it's
gotta
be
a
dream
ow
wake
up
ow
gotta
wake
up
this
can't
be
happening
this
can't
be
what's
the
word
oh
uh
i've
got
back
issues
of
the
uh
papers
um
to
try
to
do
some
research
did
you
find
anything
i
don't
know
you
don't
know
if
you
didn't
find
anything
i'm
having
a
problem
what
is
it
ii
can't
read
what
do
you
mean
you
can
read
like
three
languages
five
actually
on
a
normal
day
ththe
words
here
don't
make
any
ssense
iit's
gibberish
that's
him
who
the
kid
i've
been
seeing
around
school
'twelveyearold
billy
palmer
was
found
beaten
and
unconscious
after
his
kiddie
league
game
saturday
doctors
describe
his
condition
as
critical'
when
was
this
published
last
week
it
says
he's
in
a
coma
in
intensive
care
this
is
the
boy
from
the
hospital
the
first
victim
uh
you
you've
seen
him
around
the
school
yeah
first
when
the
spiders
got
wendell
and
and
then
when
i
didn't
know
a
thing
on
the
history
test
i
thought
it
was
weird
seeing
this
kid
around
but
i
forgot
about
it
uh
the
boy's
been
in
a
coma
for
a
week
how
can
this
be
possible
what
am
i
knowledge
girl
now
explanations
are
your
terrain
uh
well
um
there's
astral
projection
uh
the
theory
that
while
one
sleeps
one
has
another
body
aan
astral
body
which
can
travel
through
time
and
space
billy's
in
a
coma
that's
like
sleep
right
in
a
manner
of
speaking
aaalthough
one
doesn't
always
awake
from
a
coma
could
i
be
seeing
billy's
asteroid
body
astral
body
and
ii
don't
know
as
usual
one
doesn't
have
an
inordinate
amount
of
information
to
work
with
lucky
nineteen
there
you
are
i've
been
looking
everywhere
why
aren't
you
in
class
dad
what
are
you
doing
here
yyou're
not
supposed
to
pick
me
up
till
after
school

i
i
need
to
talk
to
you

is
wrong

it
mom

not
your
mother

i
speak
with
you
for
a
moment
privately
um

yeah
uh
oh
i'm
sorry
dad
this
is
mr
giles
the
librarian
uh
this
is
my
dad
hank
summers
my
pleasure
likewise
i'll
be
back
i
came
early
because
there's
something
i've
needed
to
tell
you
about
your
mother
and
me
why
we
split
up
well
you
always
told
me
it
was
because
uh
i
know
we
always
said
it
was
because
we'd
just
grown
too
far
apart
yeah
isn't
that
true
well
c'mon
honey
let's
let's
sit
down
you're
old
enough
now
to
know
the
truth
is
there
someone
else
no
no
it
was
nothing
like
that
then
what
was
it
it
was
you
me
having
you
raising
you
seeing
you
everyday
i
mean
do
you
have
any
idea
what
that's
like
what
gosh
you
don't
even
see
what's
right
in
front
of
your
face
do
you
well
big
surprise
there
all
you
ever
think
about
is
yourself
you
get
in
trouble
you
embarrass
us
with
all
the
crazy
stunts
you
pull
and
do
i
have
to
go
on
no
please
don't
you're
sullen
and
rude
and
you're
not
nearly
as
bright
as
i
thought
you
were
going
to
be
hey
buffy
let's
be
honest
could
you
stand
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
a
daughter
like
that
why
are
you
saying
all
these
things
because
they're
true
i
think
that's
the
least
we
owe
one
another
you
know
i
don't
think
it's
very
mature
getting
blubbery
when
i'm
just
trying
to
be
honest
speaking
of
which
i
don't
really
get
anything
out
of
these
weekends
with
you
so
what
do
you
say
we
just
don't
do
them
anymore
i
sure
thought
you'd
turn
out
differently
red
alert
where's
buffy
uh
she
she
just
stepped
out
her
her
father
came
by
early
he
he
needed
to
talk
to
her
w
where
are
your
other
clothes
oh
don't
i
wish
i
had
the
answer
to
that
question
xander
kinda
found
himself
in
front
of
our
class
not
wearing
much
of
anything
except
my
underwear
yeah
it
was
really
bad
it
was
a
bad
thing
'bad
thing'
i
was
naked
'bad
thing'
doesn't
cover
it
everyone
staring
i
would
hate
to
have
everyone
paying
attention
to
me
like
that
with
nudity
it's
a
total
nightmare
well
yeah
xander
iit's
your
nightmare
except
the
part
with
me
waking
up
goin'
'it's
all
a
dream'
it
happened
like
it
happened
to
wendell
that
thing
with
the
spiders
wendell
had
a
recurring
dream
about
that
ii
dreamt
that
i
got
lost
in
the
stacks
and
i
i
couldn't
read
of
course
uh
our
dreams
are
coming
true
dreams
that
would
be
a
musical
comedy
version
of
this
nightmares
our
our
nightmares
are
coming
true
so
why
is
this
happening
billy
well
that
explanation
was
shorter
than
usual
it's
billy
who's
billy
he's
a
boy
in
the
local
hospital
he
was
beaten
he's
in
a
coma
somehow
i
think
he's
crossed
over
from
the
nightmare
world
he's
trapped
in
and
he
brought
the
nightmare
world
with
him
thanks
a
bunch
billy
how
could
he
do
that
things
like
that
are
easy
when
you
live
on
a
hellmouth
well
um
we
have

when
the
clown
chased
you
and
you
got
so
scared
that
you
had
oh
no
sign
of
buffy
you
are
a
lousy
clown
your
balloon
animals
are
pathetic
everyone
can
make
a
giraffe
i
feel
good
i
feel
liberated
you
seem
to
be
the
only
one
things
are
getting
worse
in
a
few
hours
reality
will
fold
completely
into
the
realm
of
nightmares
well
what
do
we
do
the
only
thing
i
can
think
is
to
try
and
wake
billy
uh
no
we
can't
leave
without
buffy
agreed
but
who
knows
where
she
might
have
gone
excuse
me
when
did
they
put
a
cemetery
in
across
the
street
and
when
did
they
make
it
night
over
there
whose
nightmare
is
this
it's
mine
i've
failed
in
my
duty
to
protect
you
i
should
have
been
more
c
cautious
taken
more
time
to
train
you
but
you
were
so
gifted
and
the
evil
was
so
great
i'm
sorry
buffy
i
thought
i
was
dead
buffy
your
face
oh
god
buffy
don't
look
at
me
you
never
told
me
you
dreamt
of
becoming
a
vampire
this
isn't
a
dream
no
no
it's
not
but
there's
a
chance
that
we
can
make
it
go
away
this
all
comes
from
billy
now
if
if
we
can
only
wake
him
up
i
believe
that
the
nightmares
will
stop
and
reality
will
shift
back
into
place
but
we
must
do
it
now
i
need
you
to
hold
together
long
enough
to
help
us

you
do
that

can
thank
you

eight
other
players
on

surprised

where
he
belongs

was
kinda
heroic
