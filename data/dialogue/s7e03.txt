hi
how
are
you
doing
hi
honey
good
and
how's
it
going
with
you
two
hi
dad
go
on
see
what
you
did
hey
stop
acting
up
you
think
she'll
get
the
sign
get
the
sign
i
don't
think
she's
gonna
see
the
sign
why
is
it
so
pale
i
used
yellow
crayon
it
was
a
thing
from
when
i
talked
to
willow
on
the
bluff
i
hope
she
gets
it
oh
tell
us
again
what
you
said
well
i
was
talking
from
my
heart
and
i
knew
evil
willow
wasn't
really
ready
to—
you
were
kidding
mmhmm
a
little
bit
we've
heard
the
crayon
speech
a
few
times
not
that
it's
not
great
of
course
i
saved
the
world
with
talking
from
my
mouth
my
mouth
saved
the
world
uhhuh
i'm
getting
nervous
are
you
nervous
yeah
it's
gonna
be
weird
seeing
her
what
do
you
say
to
someone
in
this
situation
i'm
gonna
say
hi
willow
c'mon
you're
saying
it's
not
going
to
be
the
least
bit
strange
we
saw
her
kill
someone
she
was
about
to
kill
dawn—
and
giles
wouldn't
let
her
leave
unless
she
completed
that
whatever
recovery
course
right
right
she
kinda
didn't
finish
she
didn't
finish
she
didn't
finish
being
not
evil
hhe
said
it
was
really
important
that
she
come
back
early
and
that
she
was
doing
really
well
and
we
shouldn't
worry
guys
i
just
noticed
something
everyone's
off
the
plane
so
where's
willow
hi
how
are
you
doing
hi
honey
good
and
how's
it
going
with
you
two
hi
dad
go
on
see
what
you
did
hey
stop
acting
up
welcome
home
me
all
alone
are
you
frightened
to
be
all
alone
is
somebody
there
the
wind
talks
when
you're
alone
you
better
clear
out
whoever
you
are
buffy
hello
dawn
did
i
hear
the
door
they
absolutely
put
her
on
the
plane
in
london
so
she
got
off
in
chicago
when
they
stopped
she
could've
caught
a
flight
anywhere
from
there
maybe
she
doubled
back
got
off
the
plane
in
london
after
giles
left
well
if
she's
doing
that—ducking
giles—then
she's
evil
right
well
i've
avoided
giles
tons
of
times
just
meant
i
was
lazy
not
evil
i
hope
you're
right
because
defeating
lazy
willow—probably
less
hard
we
should
check
the
messages
see
if
she
tried
to
reach
us
here
's
a
good
idea
what
was
that
upstairs
willow
is
that
you
definitely
not
up
there
she
didn't
leave
a
message
i
checked
with
giles
again
too
hasn't
heard
from
her
is
he
throwing
a
tasteful
british
wiggins
oh
with
extra
wig
he's
blaming
himself
pretty
hard
like
he
should've
known
she
wasn't
ready
to
come
back
ii
kept
telling
him
you
know
it
wasn't
his
fault
maybe
something
about
us
she
couldn't
face
like
she
didn't
think
we
were
ready
to
forgive
her
i
get
that
so
giles
is
blaming
giles
and
we're
blaming
us
is
anyone
gonna
blame
willow
oh
don't
give
me
shock
face
i
mean
will
anyone
around
here
ever
start
asking
for
help
when
they
need
it
look
if
willow
flipped
out
it's
her
bad
we
can
only
be
here
for
her
so
much
if
she
won't
be
you
know
here
hello
i'm
calling
for
giles
uh
mr
giles
right
council
meeting
all
day
no
no
i
know
he
can't
be
reached
there
thanks
bye
anya
anya
don't
don't
run
away
what
are
you
doing
here
i
thought
you
were
with
giles
studying
how
to
not
kill
people
i
just
got
back
just
got
back
as
in
you're
all
better
or
just
got
back
to
bring
about
a
fiery
apocalypse
of
death

have
been
studying
working
real
hard

i

you're
even
thinking

it
won't
suspect
you
even
for
a
minute
no
ii
don't—
when
did
you
get
all
insightful
i'm
surprisingly
sensitive
so
will
you
help
me
is
it
difficult
or
timeconsuming
this
isn't
going
to
get
all
sexy
is
it
i'd
be
shocked
ok
do
you
have
your
powder
oh
i
ate
that
i
have
it
ok
we
scatter
it
over
the
map
and
everywhere
there's
a
demon
a
little
light
appears
oh
pretty
will
it
hurt
the
carpet
no
ok
scatter
oh
hey
look—that's
me
hello
what's
that
huge
clump
it's
the
high
school
it's
all
hellmouthy
is
underneath
things
have
been
stirring
there
lately
is
it
getting
brighter
smoke
ah
ok
remember
our
talk
about
the
carpet
thithis
could
be
it
it's
strong
it's
near
the
body
and
it's
all
by
itself
hiding
in
the
woods
oror
maybe
cave
there
are
a
couple
of
good
caves
around
there
i
don't
know
sounds
pretty
thin
to
me
well
that's
why
you
teleport
over
there
real
quick
like
a
bunn—real
quick
and
uh
see
if
i'm
right
no
sorry
you
damaged
my
carpet
anya
you're
a
vengeance
demon
just
teleport
well
as
it
turns
out
teleporting
isn't
a
right
it's
a
privilege
i
withdrew
a
vengeance
spell
last
week
and
this
is
my
punishment
i
can
only
teleport
for
official
business
i
have
to
file
a
flight
plan
and
everything
oh
i'm
sorry
that
must
be
hard
yeah
it
bites
a
pretty
big
one
and
the
vengeance
itself
iit's
not
as
fulfilling
as
i
remember
really
'cause
i
got
the
impression
that
you
enjoyed—you
know
inflicting
well
causing
pain
sounds
really
cool
i
know
but
turns
out
it's
really
upsetting
didn't
use
to
be
but
now
it
is
is
it
like
you're
scared
of
losing
that
feeling
again
and
that
having
it
be
ok
to
hurt
people
and
then
you're
not
in
charge
of
the
power
anymore
because
it's
in
charge
of
you
wow
that
was
really
overdramatically
stated
but
yeah
that's
it
i
get
it
believe
me
i'm
sorry
willow
i
wish
it
were
better
for
you
you
too
it
did
get
a
little
sexy
didn't
it
i
have
to
find
this
monster
willow
um
isn't
there
another
spell
i
mean
you're
trying
to
find
buffy
and
xander
couldn't
we
use
a
spell
to
do
that
i
did
ii
tried
and
something
went
kaflooey
and
it
didn't
work
what
did
it
say
it
said
they
don't
exist
ok
so
i
looked
up
demons
that
skin
their
victims
and
demons
that
flay
their
victims
'cause
you
know
same
thing
there's
a
ton
of
prospects
anything
else
gone
uh
eyeballs
toenails
or
viscera
that's
guts
she
knows
about
viscera
makes
you
proud
just
skin
ok
i'll
work
on
that
what's
up
i
need
to
do
something
i
just—i
have
this
feeling
in
my
gut—
in
your
viscera
—that
we
know
exactly
who
did
this
and
all
of
this
work
that
we're
doing
is
just
a
way
for
us
to
convince
ourselves
that
willow's
ok
oh
guys
i
got
a
good
one
a
demon
called
gnarl
he's
a
parasite
with
these
nasty
long
fingernails
he
secretes
something
through
them
and
uses
that
to
paralyze
his
victims
he
then
cuts
strips
of
their
skin
while
they're
still
alive
it
takes
hours
we
didn't
find
any
strips
of
skin
which
by
the
way
gghhhh
you
wouldn't
he
eats
them
that's
why
he's
a
parasite
it's
like
his
natural
food
dawn
you're
new
at
this
and
i
get
why
you're
proud
but
i'm
not
exactly
sure
why
this
demon
is
any
more
likely
than
any
of
the
others
you
never
said
pool
of
blood
there
was
no
pool
just
splatters
then
this
is
your
guy
he
laps
up
the
blood
you
could
say
it's
like
his
natural
beverage
you're
terrifying
now
if
we
just
knew
how
to
find
this
thing
well
we
could
ask
some
questions
over
at
willy's
place
or
we
could
be
smart
sorry
xander
what
wwhoever
did
this
had
to
get
blood
on
them
which
means
they
left
a
trail
right
minute
traces
of
blood
and
we
have
a
way
to
track
it
we
have
a—
oh
i
get
it
what
how
what's
going
on
william's
a
good
boy
carries
her
water
carries
her
sin
supposed
to
get
easier
isn't
it
supposed
to
help
to
help
but
it
doesn't
still
so
heavy
should've
put
a
leash
on
him
yes
let's
tie
ourselves
to
the
crazy
vampire
you
really
think
it's
gonna
work
it's
pretty
easy
spike
follows
the
exciting
smell
of
blood
and
we
follow
the
fairly
ripe
smell
of
spike
it's
smellementary
also
i'm
sure
there's
tons
of
stuff
like
this
you
know
procedures
we
can
use
that
don't
involve
magic
spells
just
good
solid
detective
work
and
we
can
develop
a
database
of
tooth
impressions
and
demon
skin
samples
and
i
could
wear
high
heels
more
often
wow
that
was
so
close
to
being
empowered
everybody
loves
a
slender
ankle
that's
it
end
of
the
line
everyone
off
keep
your
ticket
you'll
need
that
that's
a
rock
cliff
well
give
him
a
break
buffy
maybe
it's
a
vicious
skineating
rock
cliff
there's
a
cave
in
it
look
i'm
insane
what's
his
excuse
all
alone
dark
and
dank
i
was
hoping
it'd
be
dark
and
dank
shh
do
you
hear
that
no
i
don't
but
now
i
do
something's
moving
in
here
guess
we're
in
the
right
place
look
at
the
shorn
lamb
see
how
he
trembles
is
it
the
cold
wind
or
is
it
that
the
flock
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
poor
little
lamb
all
alone
you
guys
hear
that
right
yep
it's
echoing
i
know
it
sounds
close
but
i
don't
think—
dawn
are
you
ok
i
guess
so
poison
paralyzes
dawn
ok
we
need
to
get
her
out
of
here
we'll
deal
with
him
later
seal
him
in
what's
going
on
who's
there
no
stop
ha
ha
ha
no
way
out
now
no
way
out
protect
me
goddess
in
thy
name
i
supplicate
myself
take
the
powers
from
my
enemy
and
lay
him
lower
than
the
lowest
field
gnarl
loves
spells
he
keeps
them
as
pets
they
love
him
and
they
leave
him
alone
you
may
be
immune
to
magic
but
i've
got
more
than
that
you
wanna
fight
your
friends
left
you

not
dying
she's
just
paralyzed
oh
paralyzed
how
paralyzed
how
in
the
not
moving
way
well
there's
lots
of
different
ways
did
you
try
this
hey
hey
oh
you're
poseable
she's
poseable
it's
a
common
variety
watch
this
huh
neat
as
you
please
hardly
a
need
to
undo
her
where'd
you
get
the
nuts
brazil
no
need
to
thank
me
by
the
way
for
sitting
with
her
i'm
feeling
very
benevolent
today
helping
willow
helping
you
you
might
even
call
it
even
for
that
whole
worm
thing
last
week
yeah
i
don't
think
we
could
call—
wait
you
saw
willow
umhmm
oh
she's
looking
for
you
by
the
way
decided
you
might
be
out
in
some
cave
sounded
pretty
tenuous
cave
anya
listen
this
is
really
important
did
willow
go
to
that
cave
mmhmm
last
time
i
saw
her
that's
where
she
was
headed
shall
i
make
her
salute
that'd
be
very
cute
xander
she
could
be
there
right
now
willow
could
be
trapped
with
the
gnarl
uh
it's
not
the
gnarl
just
gnarl
oh
wouldn't
it
be
tragic
if
you
were
here
being
kinda
silly
with
your
comically
paralyzed
sister
while
willow
was
dying
anya
you
know
about
this
creature
uhhuh
sure
you're
coming
with
us
they
wouldn't
leave
they'll
return
they
don't
want
you
lock
you
in
nice
white
skin
and
if
they
do
return
where
will

find
you
inside
me

this
feeling
that

sorry
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
that's
all
i
had
left
in
me
anyway
i
didn't
realize
meditating
was
such
hard
work
i'm
healing
growing
new
skin
wow
that's
magic
right
i
mean
when
most
people
when
they
meditate
don't
get
extra
skin
right
'cause
clem
should
like
cut
back
it's
magic
i'm
drawing
power
from
the
earth
to
heal
myself
we're
on
the
second
floor
you
know
giles
says
everything's
part
of
the
earth
this
bed
the
air
us
explains
why
my
fingernails
get
dirty
even
when
i
don't
do
anything
plus
you
stuck
your
thumbs
in
a
demon
true
you're
wiped
out
ii
should
go
no
please
stay
i
missed
you
so
much
when
i
couldn't
find
you
we
missed
you
too
i
missed
you
dawn's
uh
working
on
what
caused
the
mutual
noseeums
but
so
far
we
haven't—
i
did
it
you
did
a
spell
i
didn't
mean
to
ii
just
remember
thinking
i
wasn't
ready
to
see
you
guys
yet
i
was
afraid
we
wouldn't
you
know
connect
so
you
made
it
happen
just
by
thinking
it
guess
i
have
a
ways
to
go
before
i
master
my
powers
huh
it's
ok
as
long
as
you're
all
right
it's
nice
to
be
forgiven
too
bad
i
need
so
much
of
it
i
have
a
confession
to
make
i
thought
it
might
be
you
with
the
flaying
i
know
i
wanna
be
the
kind
of
person
that
wouldn't
think
that
xander
never
thought
it
he
did
a
little
heck
i
did
a
little
xander
has
the
luxury
of
not
saying
it
but
you're
the
slayer
you
have
to
say
stuff
like
that
it's
ok
it's
ok
too
if
you
still
don't
think
i
can
recover
from
this
magic
stuff
'cause
honestly
i'm
not
that
sure
about
it
either
i
thought
you
were
too
tired
it
hurts
too
much
not
to
try
i'm
sorry
it
just
takes
so
much
strength
i
don't
have
that
much
i
got
so
much
strength
i'm
giving
it
away
are
you
sure
will
it
help
much
good
