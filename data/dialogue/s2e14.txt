active
oh
damn
it
he
nearly
killed

we
thought
well
we
we
had
to

stuck
in
the
sewer
tunnels
and
with
the
hiding
we
just
split
up
uh
no
one's
heard
from
him
i'm
sure
he'll
come
by
yeah
i'm
i'm
sure
you're
right
buffy
the
judge
we
we
must
stop
him
i
know
what
can
you
tell
us
not
much
i
um
i
kicked
him
it
was
just
like
a
sudden
fever
if
he'd
got
his
hands
on
me
in
time
he
won't
need
to
the
stronger
he
gets
he'll
be
able
to
reduce
us
to
charcoal
with
a
look
also
not
the
prettiest
man
in
town
i
better
continue
researching
must
look
for
a
weak
spot
the
rest
of
you
should
get
to
your
classes
yeah
i
better
go
too
yeah
yeah
yeah
buffy
wait
up
i'll
uh
go
on
the
'net
and
search
for
anything
on
the
judge
thank
you
after
classes
i'll
come
back
and
help
you
research
yeah
you
might
find
something
useful
if
it's
in
an
'i
can
read'
book
you
don't
think
angel
would
have
gone
after
the
judge
himself
do
you
no
he'd
know
better
than
that
maybe
he
just
needed
i
don't
know
i
just
i
wish
he'd
contact
me
i
need
to
talk
to
him
are
we
feeling
better
then
i'm
naming
all
the
stars
you
can't
see
the
stars
love
that's
the
ceiling
also
it's
day
i
can
see
them
but
i've
named
them
all
the
same
name
and
there's
terrible
confusion
did
you
see
any
further
do
you
know
what
happens
to
angel
well
he
moves
to
new
york
and
tries
to
fulfill
that
broadway
dream
it's
tough
sledding
but
one
day
he's
working
in
the
chorus
when
the
big
star
twists
her
ankle
you
don't
give
up
do
you
as
long
as
there's
injustice
in
the
world
as
long
as
scum
like
you
is
walking
well
rolling
the
streets
i'll
be
around
look
over
your
shoulder
i'll
be
there
uh
yeah
angel
um
look
over
your
shoulder
hurts
doesn't
it
well
you
know
it
kinda
itches
a
little
don't
just
stand
there

him
gee
maybe
he's
broken
what
the
hell
is
going
on
this
one
cannot
be
burnt
he
is
clean
clean
you
mean
he's
there's
no
humanity
in
him
i
couldn't
have
said
it
better
myself
angel
yeah
baby
i'm
back
is
it
really
true
it's
really
true
you've
come
home
no
more
of
this
'i've
got
a
soul'
crap
what
can
i
say
hmm
i
was
going
through
a
phase
this
is
great
this
is
so
great
everything
in
my
head
is
singing
we're
family
again
we'll
feed
grrr
and
we'll
play
i've
got
to
tell
you
it
made
me
sick
to
my
stomach
seeing
you
being
the
slayer's
lap
dog
how
did
this
happen
you
wouldn't
believe
me
if
i
told
you
oh
who
cares
what
matters
is
now
he's
back
now
it's
four
against
one
which
are
the
kind
of
odds
i
like
to
play
psst
we're
going
to
destroy
the
world
want
to
come
yeah
destroying
the
world
great
i'm
really
more
interested
in
the
slayer
well
she's
in
the
world
so
that
should
work
out
give
me
tonight
hmm
what
do
you
mean
lie
low
for
a
night
i
guarantee
you
by
the
time
you
go
public
she
won't
be
anything
resembling
a
threat
you've
really
got
a
yen
to
hurt
this
girl
haven't
you
she
made
me
feel
like
a
human
being
that's
not
the
kind
of
thing
you
just
forgive
ok
no
no
he
didn't
but
i'm
sure
he'll
well
buffy
he
probably
has
some
plan
and
he's
trying
to
protect
you
well
ii
don't
know
what
i'm
not
in
on
the
plan
it's
his
plan
no
don't
even
say
that
angel
is
not
dead
say
'hi'
for
me
yeah
of
course
we'll
be
here
okay
bye
say
'hi'
for
me
what's
the
word
she's
checked
every
place
she
can
think
of
she
even
beat
up
willy
the
snitch
a
couple
of
times
angel's
vanished
but
he
does
do
that
on
occasion
no
oh
yeah
but
she's
extra
wigged
this
time
i
guess
'cause
of
her
dreams
god
what
if
something
really
happened
to
him
is
she
gonna
join
us
here
yeah
she's
just
stopping
at
home
first
nada
did
you
find
anything
this
book
mentions
the
judge
but
nothing
useful
big
scary
no
weapon
forged
can
stop
him
took
an
army
to
take
him
down
blah
blah
blah
we
need
some
insight
a
weak
spot
well
we're
not
gonna
find
it
here
sorry
i
snapped
at
you
before
well
i'm
reeling
from
that
new
experience
i
was
crazed
i
wasn't
thinking
i
know
you
were
too
busy
rushing
off
to
die
for
your
beloved
buffy
you'd
never
die
for
me
no
i
might
die
from
you
does
that
get
me
any
points
no
come
on
can't
we
just
kiss
and
make
up
i
don't
wanna
make
up
but
i'm
okay
with
the
other
part
willow
uh
we
were
just
willow
willow
willow
come
on
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
well
not
'knew
it'
in
the
sense
of
having
the
slightest
idea
but
i
knew
there
was
something
i
didn't
know
you
two
were
fighting
way
too
much
it's
not
natural
i
know
it's
weird
weird
it's
against
all
laws
of
god
and
man
it's
cordelia
remember
the
the
'we
hate
cordelia'
club
of
which
you
are
the
treasurer
look
i
was
gonna
tell
you
gee
what
stopped
you
could
it
be
shame
all
right
let's
overreact
shall
we
but
i'm
willow
we
were
just
kissing
it
doesn't
mean
that
much
no
it
just
means
that
you'd
rather
be
with
someone
you
hate
than
be
with
me
angel
hey
oh
hey
oh
my
god
i
was
so
worried
i
didn't
mean
to
frighten
you
where
did
you
go
been
around
ohhh
oh
my
god
i
was
freaking
out
you
just
disappeared
what
i
took
off
but
you
didn't
say
anything
you
just
left
yeah
like
i
really
wanted
to
stick
around
after
that
what
you
got
a
lot
to
learn
about
men
kiddo
although
i
guess
you
proved
that
last
night
what
are
you
saying
let's
not
make
an
issue
out
of
it
okay
i
i
don't
understand
was
it
mme
was
i
not
good
you
were
great
really
i
thought
you
were
a
pro
how
can
you
say
this
to
me
lighten
up
it
was
a
good
time
it
doesn't
mean
like
we
have
to
make
a
big
deal
it
is
a
big
deal
it's
what
bells
ringing
fireworks
a
dulcet
choir
of
pretty
little
birdies
come
on
buffy
it's
not
like
i've
never
been
there
before
don't
touch
me
i
should've
known
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
handle
it
angel
i
love
you
love
you
too
i'll
call
you
you
know
what
it
is
this
thing
vengeance
uncle
i
have
served
you
i
have
been
faithful
i
need
to
know
to
the
modern
man
vengeance
is
a
verb
an
idea
you
told
me
to
watch
angel
you
told
me
to
keep
him
from
the
slayer
i
tried
but
there
are
other
factors
there
are
terrible
things
happening
here
that
we
cannot
control
we
control
nothing
we
are
not
wizards
janna
we
merely
play
our
part
angel
could
be
of
help
to
us
i
mean
he
may
be
the
only
chance
we
have
to
stop
the
judge
it
is
too
late
for
that
why
the
curse
angel
is
meant
to
suffer
not
to
live
as
human
one
moment
of
true
happiness
of
contentment
one
moment
where
the
soul
that
we
restored
no
longer
plagues
his
thoughts
and
that
soul
is
taken
from
him
then
if
somehow
if
if
it's
happened
then
angelus
is
back
i
hoped
to
stop
it
but
i
realize
now
it
was
arranged
to
be
so
buffy
loves
him
and
now
she
will
have
to
kill
him
unless
he
kills
her
first
uncle
this
is
insanity
people
are
going
to
die
yes
it
is
not
justice
we
serve
it
is
vengeance
you
are
a
fool
we're
all
fools
will
hey
where'd
you
go
home
i'm
glad
you
came
back
we
can't
do
this
without
you
let's
get
this
straight
i
don't
understand
it
i
don't
wanna
understand
it
you
have
gross
emotional
problems
and
things
are
not
okay
between
us
but
what's
happening
right
now
is
more
important
than
that
okay
what
about
the
judge
where
do
we
stand
on
a
pile
of
really
boring
books
that
say
exactly
the
same
thing
lemme
guess
'no
weapon
forged'
xander
'it
took
an
army'
willow
yeah
where's
an
army
when
you
need
one
what
whoa
whoa
i
i
think
i'm
having
a
thought
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's
a
thought
now
i'm
having
a
plan
now
i'm
having
a
wiggins
what's
going
on
let's
get
to
the
library
willow
xander
angel
thank
god
you're
okay
did
you
see
buffy
yeah
what's
up
with
the
lights
i
don't
know
listen
i
think
i
have
an
idea
forget
about
that
now
i
i
got
something
to
show
you
show
us
yeah
xander
go
get
the
others
okay
and
willow

away
from
him
what
walk
to
me
what
are
you
talking
about
it's
ang

do
that
oh
i
think
i
do
that
angel
he's
not
angel
anymore
are
you
wrong
i
am
angel
at
last
oh
my
god
i
got
a
message
for
buffy
why
don't
you
give
it
to
me
yourself
well
it's
not
really
the
kind
of
message
you
tell
it
sort
of
involves
finding
the
bodies
of
all
your
friends
this
can't
be
you
gee
we
already
covered
that
subject
angel
there
must
be
some
part
of
you
inside
that
still
remembers
who
you
are
dream
on
schoolgirl
your
boyfriend
is
dead
you're
all
gonna
join
him
leave
willow
alone
and
deal
with
me
but
she's
so
cute
and
helpless
really
a
turnon
things
are
about
to
get
very
interesting
buffy
you
okay
buffy
and
we're
absolutely
certain
that
that
angel
has
reverted
to
his
former
self
yeah
uh
we're
all
certain
anyone
not
feeling
certain
here
giles
you
wouldn't
have
believed
him
he
was
so
he
came
here
to
kill
us
what
are
we
gonna
do
i'm
leaning
towards
blind
panic
myself
rupert
don't
talk
like
that
the
kids
i'm
sorry
it's
just
that
things
are
bad
enough
with
the
judge
here
angel
crossing
over
to
the
other
side
iii
wasn't
prepared
for
that
none
of
us
were
are
you
okay
is
there
anything
i
can
do
i
should've
known
when
i
saw
him
at
the
house
he
was
different
the
things
he
said
what
things
it's
private
but
you
didn't
know
he
had
turned
bad
how
did
you
what
well
you
knew
you
told
me
to
get
away
from
him
well
i
saw
his
face
if
only
we
knew
how
it
happened
what
do
you
mean
well
something
set
it
off
some
some
uh
event
must've
triggered
his
transformation
well
if
anyone
would
know
buffy
itit
should
be
you
i
don't
well
did
anything
happen
last
night
that
that
might
giles
please
i
can't
buffy
i'm
sorry
but
we
can't
afford
to
buffy
giles
shut
up
this
is
great
there's
an
unkillable
demon
in
town
angel's
joined
his
team
the
slayer
is
a
basket
case
i'd
say
we've
hit
bottom
i
have
a
plan
oh
no
here's
a
lower
place
i
don't
know
what's
up
with
angel
but
i
think
i
may
have
a
way
to
deal
with
this
judge
guy
what
do
we
do
i
think
um
i
think
i
may
need
cordelia
for
this
one
and
we
may
need
wheels
well
my
car
is
it
might
have
to
be
bigger
no
problem
i'll
get
oz
he
has
a
van
good
okay
care
to
let
me
in
on
the
plan
i'm
a
part
of
no
why
not
because
if
i
tell
you
then
you
won't
do
it
just
meet
me
at
willow's
house
in
half
an
hour
and
wear
something
trashy
er
i'm
not
sure
what
we
should
do
about
buffy
assuming
they
don't
attack
tonight
i
think
we
should
just
let
her
be
i
agree
iii
can
imagine
what
she's
going
through
no
i
don't
think
you
can
you
should've
seen
her
face
it
was
priceless
i'll
never
forget
it
so
you
didn't
kill
her
then
of
course
not
now
i
know
you
haven't
been
in
the
game
for
a
while
mate
but
we
still
do
kill
people
sort
of
our
raison
d'etre
you
know
you
don't
want
to
kill
her
do
you
you
want
to
hurt
her
just
like
you
hurt
me
nobody
knows
me
like
you
do
dru
she'd
better
