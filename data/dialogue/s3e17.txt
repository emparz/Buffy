soul

nose
in
it
suddenly
wondering

expression
comes
from

don't
need
to
see
movies

get
worked
up

i'm
gonna
lose
control

slayers
highly
unusual
talk
fast
how
would
you
like
to
get
your
hands
on
the
books
of
ascension
never
heard
of
'em
books
of
ascension
very
powerful
works
and
i'm
not
talking
about
the
prose
they
deal
with
some
ah
dark
stuff
and
the
mayor
would
hate
for
somebody
to
get
a
hold
before
he
ah
well
you
know
don't
know
before
he
what
hey
hey
read
'em
and
weep
that's
all
i
got
to
say
tomorrow
i
get
the
books
meet
me
here
and
if
the
price
is
right
well
i
give
the
books
to
you
not
really
looking
to
trade
with
a
demon
and
if
this
were
still
a
barter
economy
that
would
be
a
problem
i
want
cash
princess
five
large
for
the
whole
set
so
you
can
buy
i'm
guessing
here
some
skin
care
products
plane
ticket
out
of
the
hellmouth
before
its
adios
slayer
loco
so
five
g's
what
do
you
say
i
think
die
fiend
sums
it
up
wouldn't
you
say
oh
let
him
go
i
don't
think
he
falls
into
the
deadly
threat
to
humanity
category
a
demon's
a
demon
i'd
like
to
know
about
these
books
of
ascension
anything
that
would
pin
the
mayor
down
would
be
great
yeah
it'd
be
great
and
what
exactly
did
this
demon
look
like
demonic
ah
and
you
say
he
has
the
books
of
ascension
or
will
soon
and
he
was
what
willing
to
sell
them
that's
what
i
said
hmm
you
know
what
i
wish
i
wish
you'd
pull
your
hair
back
i
know
i
know
fashion's
not
exactly
my
thing
but
gosh
darn
it
you
know
you've
got
such
a
nice
face
i
can't
understand
why
you
hide
it
yeah
sure
whatever
it's
just
a
matter
of
time
before
this
demon
guy
is
gonna
spill
then
buffy
and
the
superfriends
are
gonna
you
know
you
worry
too
much
for
a
girl
for
your
age
that's
unnecessary
stress
luckily
i've
got
just
the
thing
there
you
go
now
first
you
load
up
on
calcium
then
find
this
demon
kill
the
heck
out
of
him
and
bring
the
books
to
me
and
if
buffy
gets
to
him
first
oh
well
frankly
i
don't
like
to
think
about
that
i
like
good
positive
up
thoughts
if
you
fail
me
in
that
way
well
you
know
replacing
mr
trick
was
chore
enough
oh
come
on
don't
worry
drink
up
there's
nothing
uncool
about
healthy
teeth
and
bones
and
you
say
this
demon
wanted
cash
that's
very
unusual
demons
after
money
whatever
happened
to
the
still
beating
heart
of
a
virgin
no
one
has
any
standards
anymore
well
he
said
the
books
were
worth
the
price
what's
this
ascension
mean
i'm
not
sure
no
not
really
a
common
term
in
demonology
ooh
ooh
the
marenschadt
text
i
think
in
the
section
on
genocide
they
mention
ascension
well
we
have
a
winner
and
more
importantly
two
losers
where
did
you
find
that
volume
in
the
top
of
your
book
cabinet
with
the
stuff
you
try
to
keep
hidden
hidden
are
there
any
engravings
i
should
know
about
no
just
magic
secrets
giles
doesn't
think
i'm
ready
for
ah
yes
yes
here
we
are
there's
a
reference
here
to
the
journal
of
desmond
kane
pastor
of
a
town
called
sharpsville
of
kane
of
sharpsville
the
town
more
or
less
disappeared
so
ascension
possibly
not
a
lovein
i
think
you
should
meet
with
this
demon
buffy
yeah
anybody
got
five
thousand
dollars
i
have
something
important
to
ask
you
important
let's
start
calculating
those
odds
people
what
are
you
doing
friday
night
uh
i
uh
as
always
my
sacred
duty
as
a
watcher
prevents
me
from
ah
why
i
have
a
paper
to
write
for
english
and
you're
english
so
i
thought

what
is
it
so
wrong
to
be
getting
an
insider's
perspective
i
study
best
in
a
good
restaurant
around
eightish
think
it
over
and
on
the
day
the
words
flimsy
excuse
were
redefined
we
stood
in
awe
and
watched
right
books
of
ascension
mayor
slaughter
tell
you
what
why
don't
we
try
to
find
this
demon
sooner
rather
than
later
i
think
faith
might
be
useful
in
that
persuasion
part
i
imagine
so
where
is
faith
anyway
hey
slayer
you
know
i
wasn't
expecting
company
give
me
a
minute
and
i'll
have
the
place
tidied
up
for
you
you
got
the
books
well
that
depends
you
got
my
money
you're
tough
in
negotiations
and
i
respect
that
check
'em
out
now
ah
that
is
quality
merchandise
that's
worth
five
grand
easy
books
of
ascension
mm
hmm
original
editions
and
everything
uh
great
condition
okay
it's
a
little
worn
on
one
spine
some
slight
foxing
but
otherwise
perfect
now
the
five
grand
it's
ah
you
know
negotiable
i
don't
like
to
haggle
faith
angel
i
got
nowhere
else
to
go
look
i
hate
asking
for
help
but
i'm
asking
cause
uh
i'm
in
trouble
i'm
in
trouble
the
real
bad
kind
it's
okay
no
it's
a
couple
of
county
lines
over
from
okay
believe
me
look
just
talk
come
on
start
from
the
beginning
mind
if
i
skip
past
the
'mom
never
loved
me'
part
and
get
right
to
it
i'm
scaring
myself
i
know
the
feeling
that's
why
i
came
to
you
i
don't
want
to
get
all
twelve
steppy
but
remember
when
you
told
me
that
killing
people
would
make
me
feel
like
some
kind
of
god
i
think
i
just
came
down
to
earth
it's
not
human
if
that's
what
you're
thinking
not
that
that
makes
me
feel
any
better
or
this
guy
any
less
dead
faith
you
need
help
you
can't
do
this
alone
i
know
for
real
now
i'm
scared
scared
of
what
i
am
what
i'm
turning
into
coldblooded
straight
up
killer
like
you
not
like
me
i
didn't
have
a
choice
but
you
do
you
can
stop
this
believe
me
i
don't
want
to
end
up
the
way
everybody
said
i
would
dead
or
alone
or
a
loser
no
you
don't
have
to
i
don't
know
maybe
it's
too
late
for
me
it's
not
angel
i'm
so
scared
it's
alright
shh
it's
okay
whoa
faith
i
look
i
can
be
here
for
you
but
not
like
that
alright
i'm
with
buffy
buffy
yeah
i
didn't
mean
it
like
that
maybe
i
did
but
i
wouldn't
press
it
you
love
her
don't
you
i
love
her
good
for
you
the
two
of
you
you're
lucky
friends
yeah
we're
friends
then
i'm
lucky
too
i'd
better
go
where
i
need
to
cool
down
spend
some
time
alone
don't
worry
about
me
you've
been
a
big
help
just
knowing
somebody
cares
hey
i
know
i
shouldn't
be
asking
this
but
do
you
think
if
things
were
different
that
things
between
you
and
me
would
be
different
too
we'll
never
know
right
how
could
we
take
care
of
yourself
lifetime
of
practice
it's
not
like
i
wasn't
trying
okay
hey
there's
no
need
to
convince
me
i'm
sure
you
gave
it
your
level
best
i
just
don't
understand
what
that
boy
could
be
thinking
try
buffy
summers
like
in
a
big
fat
one
track
way
hey
come
on
don't
be
discouraged
you're
a
bright
young
energetic
girl
with
a
whole
life
ahead
of
her
and
i
won't
tolerate
brooding
so
you
couldn't
give
him
that
one
moment
of
true
happiness
i
was
thinking
more
along
the
lines
of
a
long
weekend
but
okay
and
he
spurns
your
advances
so
be
it
there's
more
than
one
way
to
skin
a
cat
and
i
happen
to
know
that's
factually
true
we
want
to
take
angel's
soul
away
if
we
can't
do
it
by
giving
him
happiness
well
by
golly
we'll
just
have
to
do
it
in
the
most
painful
way
imaginable
find
anything
six
course
banquet
of
nothing
with
a
scoop
of
sodall
as
a
palate
closer
i've
had
no
better
luck
there
must
be
something
about
this
accession
somewhere
perhaps
i
should
contact
the
council
maybe
run
a
search
no
i
don't
uh
it
should
be
i
that
the
council
isn't
entirely
aware
that
i'm
letting
you
work
for
me
um
with
me
i
don't
think
they'd
be
very
happy
at
the
idea
of
the
two
of
us
collaborating
well
i
wasn't
about
to
burst
into
glorious
song
about
it
myself
why
don't
you
call
i
think
the
most
expedient
plan
would
be
to
find
these
books
of
ascension
themselves
buffy
you
and
faith
must
find
this
demon
and
soon
well
i'll
go
back
to
the
scene
see
if
i
can
track
him
wait
for
faith
that
could
be
hours
the
girl
makes
godot
look
punctual
i'll
just
go
myself
buffy
this
is
a
job
for
the
both
of
you
this
demon
could
be
anywhere
if
these
books
are
important
as
he
says
he
has
good
reason
to
hide
finding
him
is
going
to
be
extremely
difficult
found
your
demon
fashion
tip
wes
mouth
looks
better
closed
got
the
address
i
beat
it
out
of
willy
the
snitch
personally
you
beat
up
willy
sure
well
actually
let's
just
say
i
applied
some
pressure
or
more
accurately
that
i
asked
politely
and
then
uh
okay
i
bribed
him
how
much
twentyeight
bucks
does
the
council
reimburse
for
that
kind
of
stuff
did
you
get
a
receipt
damn
i
know
this
it's
down
by
the
bus
station
not
the
nicest
part
of
town
again
see
no
standards
i
mean
any
selfrespecting
demon
should
be
living
in
a
pit
of
filth
or
a
nice
crypt
i'll
remember
to
mention
that
mention
what
where
we
going
girlfriend
actually
i
can
handle
this
one
solo
why
should
you
get
to
have
all
the
fun
share
share
that's
fair
right
right
got
our
demon
oh
well
let's
go
look
him
up
is
it
me
or
did
it
just
get
really
cold
in
here
faith
careful
right
missed
you
last
night
yeah
i
was
patrolling
no
shortage
of
scum
you
gotta
watch
in
sunnydale
right
so
i've
heard
looks
like
somebody
got
here
first
betting
they
got
the
books
too
some
hit
this
wasn't
just
a
hit
this
was
somebody's
idea
of
a
party
maybe
the
guy
put
up
a
fight
we
gotta
get
going
come
on
nothing
we
can
do
here
now
you
coming
mint
didn't
think
so
well
scheduling
a
man
of
your
talents
is
quite
the
chore
i'll
tell
you
between
the
chanting
and
the
sacrifice
oh
my
golf
game
is
shot
but
heeere
you
are
you
know
why
i've
summoned
you
can
you
do
it
need
anything
from
me
you
have
risked
great
danger
in
calling
on
me
the
deadliest
magics
are
needed
to
rob
this
creature
of
its
soul
big
job
alright
and
so
it
shall
be
done
oh
that's
just
swell
listen
you
sure
you
don't
want
any
are
you
okay
you
seem
a
little
on
edge
is
there
anything
that's
wrong
it's
nothing
it's
nothing
what
about
her
i
went
to
angel's
last
night
and
faith
was
there
they
looked
sort
of
intimate
no
way
i
know
what
you're
thinking
and
no
way
you're
right
faith
would
never
do
that
faith
would
totally
do
that
faith
was
built
to
do
that
comfort
remember
comfort
here
i
mean
please
does
angel
come
up
to
faith's
standards
for
a
guy
let's
see
is
he
breathing
actually
no
but
buffy
angel
there's
no
way
he
would
ever
do
that
i
mean
you're
the
only
thing
in
the
world
to
him
sometimes
i
wonder
angel
and
faith
have
a
lot
in
common
but
it's
so
clear
the
way
he
feels
about
you
buffy
i
too
know
the
love
of
a
taciturn
man
and
you
have
to
look
at
their
actions
i
was
well
what
did
he
say
say
you
mean
when
i
straightforwardly
asked
him
what
was
going
on
so
you
bailed
i
couldn't
i
mean
not

enough
stop
with
the
crazy
go
talk
to
angel
but
i

no
go
i
give
you
leave
to
go
thank
you
faith
hey
sorry
to
bust
in
uninvited
what
do
you
want
look
i'm
not
so
good
at
apologies
mostly
because
i
think
the
world's
out
to
screw
me
so
i'm
generally
more
owed
than
owing
but
i've
been
thinking
about
last
night
and
i
want
you
to
know
i
was
really
sorry
it's
alright
faith
no
it's
not
alright
yeah
i
was
freaked
and
needed
somebody
but
you're
with
buffy
i
should
know
better
yeah
okay
you
don't
trust
me
it's
not
that
hey
no
problem
join
the
club
look
faith
i
know
what
you're
going
through
alright
and
how
hard
it
can
be
it's
important
you
have
somebody
who's
been
there
and
who
understands
what
you're
going
through
look
i
want
to
trust
you
chump
faith
i
wanted
to
do
this
the
oldfashioned
way
but
hey
your
loss
lucky
i've
got
some
tricks
buffy
don't
know
yet
you
don't
have
to
do
this
i
know
but
it's
fun
now
relax
it'll
be
over
soon
thanks
so
much
it's
good
to
have
the
taste
of
a
slayer
back
in
my
mouth
it's
like
cigarettes
you
know
just
when
i
thought
i'd
quit
no
don't
get
up
it's
good
to
be
back
in
sunnydale
nice
climate
plenty
to
eat
no
tortured
humanity
to
hold
me
down
but
you
know
what
bothers
me
you
don't
seem
to
be
getting
the
big
picture
here
faith
now
i
don't
know
why
you
turned
me
but
i'm
just
glad
you
did
i've
got
my
reasons
let
me
guess
you
summoned
back
the
true
angelus
because
you
need
a
new
boy
toy
doesn't
work
that
way
you
wanna
be
smart
you
listen
to
me
funny
thing
about
vampires
faith
we
don't
establish
meaningful
dialogue
with
slayers
not
how
buffy
tells
it
i
should
have
known
you'd
like
it
on
top
you
want
to
listen
or
you
want
to
die
as
long
as
you're
there
i
mostly
want
you
to
wriggle
but
i'm
listening
last
time
you
got
like
this
buffy
kicked
your
ass
all
the
way
back
to
hell
you
want
to
do
better
this
time
still
listening
good
boy
now
all
you
got
to
do
is
play
nice
and
call
truce
and
i'll
hook
you
up
with
the
real
power
in
this
town
interested
very
then
get
ready
to
meet
the
new
boss
our
enemy
has
us
at
a
disadvantage
we
seem
to
be
consistently
one
step
behind
him
now
he
has
the
books
of
ascension
we
must
take
definitive
action
you
have
the
greatest
voice
have
you
ever
thought
about
doing
books
on
tape
way
to
focus
cc
yes
let's
uh
let's
try
to
stay
on
track
we
need
everyone
working
together
here
where's
angel
i
don't
know
i
went
to
the
mansion
but
he
wasn't
there
and
faith
she's
missing
too
which
means
nothing
two
unconnected
events
what
should
we
do
buffy
i
think
you
should
try
to
retrieve
the
books
of
ascension
check
out
the
mayor's
office
but
be
damned
careful
do
not
confront
the
mayor
we
don't
know
a
thing
about
him
i'll
go
home
and
stock
up
on
weapons
slip
into
something
a
little
more
breakandenterish
right
willow
how
far
did
you
get
with
the
mayor's
files
excuse
me
i
believe
wesley
is
running
this
meeting
it's
uh
it's
quite
alright
willow
it's
all
bad
news
by
the
time
i
got
through
the
encryptions
the
files
were
empty
guess
he
saw
me
coming
what
about
the
hall
of
records
go
to
the
source
good
idea
there
must
be
information
on
the
mayor
there
wesley
why
don't
you
take
the
group
and
start
looking
right
i'm
in
wesley's
group
there
is
just
the
one
group
yes
and
i
am
in
it
anyone
mind
if
i
skip
the
trip
i'm
gonna
cruise
town
keep
my
ear
to
the
ground
and
i
think
five's
a
crowd
it
really
is
i'll
drive
they
liked
your
plan
anyone
finds
anything
check
in
with
me
be
careful
so
can
i
keep
him
let's
just
take
things
step
by
step
for
the
moment
now
then
angelus
may
i
call
you
angel
well
actually
i'm
thinking
more
along
the
lines
of
you
calling
me
master
ah
you
know
angelus
attitude
may
get
you
attention
but
courtesy
wins
respect
i
am
the
one
responsible
for
your
new
attitude
that's
why
i'm
here
no
problems
with
the
transition
no
side
effects
had
a
soul
now
i'm
free
that's
terrific
poetic
too
not
that
i
read
much
poetry
except
for
those
little
ones
in
the
reader's
digest
you
know
some
of
those
are
quite
catchy
hey
i
don't
mean
to
rush
things
here
but
are
you
trying
to
get
to
some
kind
of
point
kids
today
rush
rush
rush
well
the
point
angel
is
you're
a
very
powerful
young
man
good
for
faith
and
there
just
may
be
future
for
you
in
sunnydale
i
see
you're
admiring
my
letter
opener
well
actually
i
was
thinking
of
stabbing
you
through
the
heart
with
it
please
do
nice
shot
you
see
i'm
what
you
might
call
impervious
can't
be
killed
or
harmed
in
any
way
and
that's
just
a
cornerstone
in
my
plans
for
this
great
town
of
ours
mmmm
can't
be
killed
but
you
don't
like
germs
uck
eew
awful
things
unsanitary
but
my
question
is
now
that
faith
has
brought
you
back
what
are
your
intentions
well
gee
sir
i
thought
i'd
find
that
slayer
that's
given
you
so
much
trouble
and
torture
maim
and
kill
her
fine
you
know
it's
nice
to
see
you're
not
one
of
those
slacker
types
running
around
town
today
torture
buffy
killing
her's
fine
just
make
it
a
slow
one
my
favorite
kind
wonderful
wonderful
we
don't
want
a
replacement
slayer
anytime
soon
they
can't
all
turn
out
like
my
girl
faith
have
fun
let's
do
it
uh
try
to
have
her
home

little

anymore
i
love
when
you

love
when
you
sing
wesley
can
you
say
the
words
jailbait
wesley
limey
bastard
hey

found
you
before
we
left
we
got
the
books
they're
at
the
mansion
we'd
take
'em
to
giles
ourselves
but
i
think
strength
in
numbers
is
the
way
to
go
come
on
let
me
get
those
for
you
okay
let's
get
the
books
someplace
safe
where
are
they
actually
there's
been
a
slight
change
in
plan
buff
buff
you
just
called
what's
the
matter
with
you
nothing
matter
of
act
i
haven't
felt
this
good
in
a
long
time
angel
you
know
i
never
properly
thanked
you
for
sending
me
to
hell
no
yeah
and
i'm
just
wondering
where
do
i
start
card
fruit
basket
evisceration
no
yeah
i
know
what
you're
thinking
maybe
there's
still
some
good
deep
down
inside
of
me
that
remembers
and
loves
you
if
only
you
could
reach
me
then
again
we
have
reality
i
will
kill
you
before
i
let
you
touch
me
faith
we
need
to
get
out
of
here
now
speak
for
yourself
b
me
i
like
it
here
one
thing
i
learned
about
buffy
she's
so
cute
when
she's
sleeping
hey
i
know
a
way
to
make
investigating
the
mayor
even
more
boring
on
second
thought
no
i
don't
hey
whoa
whoa
big
hey
whoa
guys
check
this
out
wow
like
father
like
son
how
about
like
exact
same
guy
like
exact
same
guy
mayor
wilkins
is
over
one
hundred
years
old
he's
not
human
i
uh
hate
to
spoil
the
mood
but
this
is
so
much
worse
than
you
think
xander
what
happened
to
you
you
know
how
some
people
hate
to
say
i
told
you
so
not
me
i
told
you
so
angel's
back
in
the
really
bad
sense
and
uh
i
told
you
so
angelus
has
turned
xander
this
is
terribly
serious
are
you
sure
gee
let
me
think
kind
of
hard
to
tell
last
thing
i
remember
was
his
fist
we
must
contact
giles
immediately
good
thinking
let's
waste
time
with
a
lively
debate
leave
buffy
alone
see
how
dead
she
gets
slow
down
xander
this
isn't
wesley's
fault
actually
it
is
faith
was
your
responsibility
guess
who's
angel's
new
playmate
faith
and
angel
together
imagine
the
possibilities
morning
sleepyhead
you
know
what
i
just
can't
believe
all
of
our
time
together
and
we
never
tried
chains
well
can't
dwell
on
the
past
especially
with
the
future
we
have
ahead
bondage
looks
good
on
you
b
the
outfit's
all
wrong
but
hey
you
don't
know
what
you're
doing
really
weird
because
something
about
all
this
just
feels
so
right
maybe
it's
one
of
those
unhappy
childhood
things
see
when
i
was
a
kid
i
used
to
beg
my
mom
for
a
dog
didn't
matter
what
kind
i
just
wanted
you
know
something
to
love
a
dog's
all
i
wanted
well
that
and
toys
but
mom
was
so
busy
you
know
enjoying
the
drinking
and
passing
out
parts
of
life
that
i
never
really
got
what
i
wanted
until
now
faith
listen
to
me
very
closely
angel's
a
killer
when
he's
done
with
me
he'll
turn
on
you
she's
right
i
probably
will
yeah
hunh
guess
we'll
just
have
to
keep
you
around
for
a
while
then
before
we
get
started
i
just
want
you
to
know
if
you're
a
screamer
feel
free
why
faith
what's
in
it
for
you
what
isn't
you
know
i
come
to
sunnydale
i'm
the
slayer
i
do
my
job
kicking
ass
better
than
anyone
what
do
i
hear
about
everywhere
i
go
buffy
so
i
slay
i
behave
i
do
the
good
little
girl
routine
and
who's
everybody
thank
buffy
it's
not
my
fault
everybody
always
asks
why
can't
you
be
more
like
buffy
but
did
anyone
ever
ask
if
you
could
be
more
like
me
i
know
i
didn't
you
get
the
watcher
you
get
the
mom
you
get
the
little
scooby
gang
what
do
i
get
jack
squat
this
is
supposed
to
be
my
town
faith
listen
to
me
why
so
you
can
impart
some
special
buffy
wisdom
that
it
do
you
think
you're
better
than
me
do
you
say
it
you
think
you're
better
than
me
i
am
always
have
been
um
maybe
you
didn't
notice
angel's
with
me
and
how
did
you
get
him
faith
magic
cast
some
sort
of
spell
cause
in
the
real
world
angel
would
never
touch
you
and
we
both
know
it
you
had
to
tie
me
up
to
beat
me
there's
a
word
for
people
like
you
faith
loser
uh
huh
you're
just
trying
to
make
me
mad
so
i'll
kill
you
for
what
your
boss's
lame
ascension
like
i
couldn't
stop
it
you
can't
i
will
keep
dreaming
no
one
can
stop
the
ascension
mayor's
got
it
wired
b
he
built
this
town
for
demons
to
feed
on
and
come
graduation
day
he's
getting
paid
and
i'll
be
sitting
at
his
right
hand
assuming
he
has
hands
after
the
transformation
i'm
not
too
clear
on
that
part
and
all
your
little
lame
ass
friends
are
going
to
be
kibbles'n'bits
think
about
that
when
your
boyfriends
cutting
into
you
i
never
knew
you
had
so
much
rage
in
you
what
can
i
say
i'm
the
world's
best
actor
second
best
graduation
day
you
think
we
missed
anything
i
think
we
know
everything
she
knows
may
i
say
something
psych
you
played
me
you
played
me
what
are
you
gonna
do
b
kill
me
you
become
me
you're
not
ready
for
that
yet
are
you
okay
the
task
is
finished
yes
thank
you
for
coming
to
me
and
for
that
rather
effective
light
show
you
put
on
this
restores
the
balance
between
us
rupert
giles
my
debt
to
you
is
now
repaid
in
full
do
not
call
upon
me
i
shan't
peace
with
you
and
with
you
his
debt
to
you
is
repaid
what
did
you
do
i
introduced
him
to
his
wife
well
i
for
one
protest
you
pitted
slayer
against
slayer
in
a
dangerous
charade
that
could've
gotten
them
both
killed
without
informing
me
i'm
telling
the
council
i
think
you
should
we
have
a
rogue
slayer
on
our
hands
i
can't
think
of
anything
more
dangerous
at
least
now
we
know
and
we
know
a
little
bit
more
about
the
ascension
graduation
day
there's
a
big
scary
unfun
at
least
angel's
not
bad
though
that's
good
right
yes
i
feel
so
much
better
knowing
that
he
broke
my
face
in
a
good
way
it's
a
good
bruise
he
was
only
acting
xander
it
was
just
an
act
well
you
win
some
you
lose
some
from
where
i'm
sitting
it's
batting
average
that
counts
so
you
lost
some
friends
i
wouldn't
exactly
call
them
friends
well
what
are
you
worried
about
chin
up
you
don't
see
me
looking
disappointed
heck
no
you
know
why
because
i
know
you'll
always
have
me
faith
i'm
the
best
the
most
important
friend
you'll
ever
have
besides
you
know
once
the
ascension
starts
the
'in'
crowd
you're
so
concerned
about
whoo
they'll
be
lucky
if
there's
enough
left
of
them
to
fill
a
pothole
promise
still
unhappy
okeydoke
i've
got
two
words
that
are
going
to
make
all
the
pain
go
away
miniature
golf
how
you
doing
been
better
not
hard
to
believe
you
were
a
real
soldier
last
night
buffy
that's
me
one
of
the
troops
i
know
how
hard
it
was
for
you
i
really
doubt
that
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
make
it
better
look
i
know
you
only
did
what
i
asked
and
we
we
got
what
we
wanted
i
never
wanted
it
to
go
that
far
i
know
that
it's
not
even
a
question
of
that
it's
just
after
i
need
a
little
bit
of
a
break
please
you
still
my
girl
always
