locate
mister

uh
talk
to
him
a
little
more
oh
it
was
a
genuine
pleasure
if
i
were
to
stop
saving
his
life
it
would
simple
things
up
so
much
do
you
think
she
walked
around
on
clouds
wearing
like
birkenstocks
and
played
a
harp
'cause
those
are
just
not
flattering
you
know
the
clonky
sandals
not
a
harp
i
mean
who
doesn't
look
good
with
a
harp
what
i'm
just
saying
what
everyone's
thinking
right
baby
you
are
attractive
and
have
many
good
qualities
it's
totally
not
stupid
to
wonder
what
it
was
like
for
buffy
but
it
could
have
been
any
one
of
a
zillion
heavenly
dimensions
all
we
know
is
that
it
was
a
good
place
and
she
was
happy
there
and
we
took
her
away
from
that
we
wrecked
it
for
her
we
didn't
wreck
we
didn't
know
we
didn't
wanna
know
we
were
so
selfish
i
was
so
selfish
maybe
we
were
i
just
feel
weird
feeling
bad
that
my
friend's
not
dead
it's
too
mindboggling
so
i've
decided
to
simplify
the
whole
thing
me
like
buffy
buffy's
alive
so
me
glad
not
to
be
miss
psycho
pep
squad
but
we
have
got
to
stop
obsessing
about
what
we
did
and
start
trying
to
make
things
better
for
buffy
i'm
with
miss
psycho
pep
squad
ah
we
need
to
spend
more
time
with
her
just
hang
out
maybe
have
weekly
dinners
over
here
or
uh
a
book
club
short
books
videos
i
can
fix
it
i
know
a
spell
no
no
more
spells
then
what
this
isn't
something
that's
gonna
be
fixed
by
a
video
club
i
know
i
messed
up
okay
and
i
wanna
fix
it
i
can't
believe
that
we
are
talking
about
this
again
you
know
how
powerful
magic
is
how
dangerous
you
could
hurt
someone
you
you
could
hurt
yourself
i
know
a
spell
that
will
make
her
forget
she
was
ever
in
heaven
god
what
is
wrong
with
you
i'm
gonna
go
get
that
phone
you
probably
don't
hear
highpitched
ring
ears
like
a
dog
i'm
gonna
help
you
with
that
do
you
think
i'm
stupid

not
to
fight
any
more
i
love
you
if
you
don't
wanna
fight
you
don't
fight
you
don't
use
magic
to
make
a
fight
disappear
but
ii
just
wanted
to
make
things
better

for
us
but
you
don't
get
to
decide
what
is
better
for
us
will
we're
in
a
relationship
we
are
supposed
to
decide
together
okay
i'm
i
realize
i
i
did
it
wrong
you
did
it
the
way
you're
doing
everything
when
things
get
rough
you
you
don't
even
consider
the
options
you
just
you
just
do
a
spell
it's
not
good
for
you
willow
and
it's
not
what
magic
is
for
but
i
i
just
wanna
help
people
maybe
that's
how
it
started
but
you're
helping
yourself
now
fixing
things
to
your
liking
including
me
tara
no
i
don't
think
this
is
gonna
work
hey
it
is
iit's
working
tara
please
i
need
you

i
won't
no
giving

protect
the
cash
register
and
do
some
spells
oh

by
dawn
cuts
off
with
a
gasp
as
a
vampire
appears
in
front
of
them
they
all
scream
turn
and
run
back
the
way
they
came
the
vampire
pursues
them
this
must
be
nice
for
us
sorry
i
mean
i
know
there's
the
vampire
problem
and
our
memory
loss
and
all
that
but
still
to
spend
this
time
together
alone
must
be
nice
uh
yes
yes
um
i'm
sure
that's
right
um
which
uh
which
book
shall
we
start
with
this
is
the
book
for
us
oh
good
does
it
focus
on
mind
control
oror
memory
loss
not
exactly
i
just
um
my
intuition
tells
me
this
is
the
book
and
i
figure
being
a
magic
shop
owner
and
a
natural
at
the
supernatural
i
should
trust
my
intuition
yyes
fine
but
as
you
recall
i
too
am
a
magic
shop
owner
true
but
my
intuition
says
that
you're
not
so
much
the
magic
guy
and
more
of
a
paperwork
type
okay
here
we
go
but
you
don't
even
know
anya
bara
bara
himble
gemination
wait
up
bloody
hell
what
are
you
doing
you
don't
know
who
you
are
right
none
of
us
do
and
we're
being
chased
by
buffy
you're
a
vampire
how
can
you
say
i
me
a
vampire
no
check
the
lumpies
and
the
teeth
i
kill
your
kind
and
i
bite
yours
so
how
come
i
don't
wanna
bite
you
and
why
am
i
fightin'
other
vampires
i
must
be
a
noble
vampire
a
good
guy
on
a
mission
of
redemption
i
help
the
hopeless
i'm
a
vampire
with
a
soul
a
vampire
with
a
soul
oh
my
god
how
lame
is
that
perhaps
we
should
try
another
book
no
this
book
made
the
little
fluffers
and
this
book's
gonna
send
'em
back
i've
got
it
this
time
okay
'himble
abri
abri
voyon'
another
bunny
appears
by
giles's
feet
yes
dear
i'm
a
hero
really
i
mean
to
be
cast
such
an
ugly
lot
in
life
and
then
to
rise
above
it
to
seek
out
better
nobler
things
it's
inspirational
isn't
it
and
the
two
of
us
natural
enemies
thrown
together
to
stand
against
the
forces
of
darkness
utter
trust
no
thought
of
me
biting
you
no
thought
of
you
staking
me
depends
on
how
long
you
keep
on
yapping
come
on
this
way
up
the
ladder
he's
coming
clearly
that
is
not
a
helpful
book
darling
come
down
and
we
will
go
about
fixing
this
in
a
sensible
fashion
sensible
you
think
it's
sensible
for
me
to
go
down
into
that
pit
of
cottontop
hell
and
let
them
hippityhop
all
over
my
vulnerable
flesh
fine
then
just
stay
up
there
and
keep
making
bunnies
that's
a
capital
plan
what
capital
i
never
know
what
you're
talking
about
loo
shag
brolly
what
the
hell
is
all
that
