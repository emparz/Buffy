y'know
i
just
gotta
say
that
this
has
been
the
most
boring
summer
ever
yeah
but
on
the
plus
side
no
monsters
or
stuff
i'm
just
so
restless
i'm
actually
looking
forward
to
school
startin'
up
again
yeah
and
that
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
a
certain
girl
we
both
know
who
is
a
vampire
slayer
please
i'm
so
over
her
did
she
uh
mention
when
she
might
be
gettin'
back
about
which
i
do
not
care
i
haven't
heard
from
her
i
got
a
couple
postcards
when
she
went
to
la
but
then
like
nothing
well
she's
probably
with
her
dad
having
a
good
time
and
you
don't
care
well
okay
there
might
be
some
interest
i'm
a
man
i
have
certain
desires
certain
needs
uhhh
i
don't
wanna
know
i
got
a
movie
for
ya
xander
you're
amish
you

tasty
willow
go
hi
guys
miss
me
buffy
hey
hey
hey
will
man
your
timing
really
doesn't
suck
when'd
you
get
back
uh
just
now
dad
drove
me
down
and
i
figured
you
two
losers
would
be
getting
into
some
kind
of
trouble
i
think
we
had
the
upper
hand
iin
a
subtle
way
does
either
of
you
even
have
a
cross
very
sloppy
well
it's
been
a
slow
summer
i
mean
that's
the
first
vampire
we've
seen
since
you
killed
the
master
it's
like
they
knew
i
was
coming
back
so
what
about
you
how
was
your
summer
did
you
slay
anything
no
uh
just
hung
out
partied
some
shopping
was
also
a
major
theme
well
you
haven't
lost
your
touch
that
vampire
i
did
kinda
whale
on
him
didn't
i
i
like
your
hair
so
how
did
you
guys
fare
did
you
have
any
fun
without
me
no
yes
uh
our
summer
was
kinda
yawnworthy
our
biggest
excitement
was
burying
the
master
that's
right
you
missed
it
right
out
by
that
tree
giles
buried
the
bones
and
we
poured
holy
water
and
we
got
to
wear
robes
very
intense
you
shoulda
been
have
you
seen
giles
why
would
i
do
that
i'll
see
him
at
school
man
i'm
really
glad
you're
back
me
too
okay
then
this
is
the
last
of
it
more
clothes
oh
do
shoes
count
as
clothes
how
much
shopping
did
you
let
her
do
oh
i
just
thought
i
was
saving
you
from
the
big
backtoschool
clothing
nightmare
my
nightmares
of
buffy
in
school
have
nothing
to
do
with
clothes
did
she
manage
to
stay
out
of
trouble
in
la
she
did
yeah
she
was
um
you
know
great
but
she
was
just
i
don't
know
um
distant
not
brooding
or
sulking
just
there
was
no
connection
the
more
time
we
spent
together
the
more
i
felt
like
she
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
hence
the
shoes
i
may
have
overcompensated
a
little
bit
hmm
it's
so
strange
you
know
at
least
when
she
was
burning
stuff
down
i
knew
what
to
say
well
welcome
to
my
world
i
haven't
been
able
to
get
through
to
her
for
so
long
i'll
just
be
happy
if
she
makes
it
through
the
school
year
it
was
a
nightmare
a
total
nightmare
i
mean
they
promised
me
they'd
take
me
to
st
croix
and
then
they
just
decide
to
go
to
tuscany
art
and
buildings
i
was
totally
beachless
for
a
month
and
a
half
no
one
has
suffered
like
i
have
of
course
i
think
that
that
kind
of
adversity
builds
character
well
then
i
thought
i
already
have
a
lot
of
character
is
it
possible
to
have
too
much
character
the
first
day
back
it
always
gets
me
yes
i
mean
it's
incredible
one
day
the
campus
is
completely
bare
empty
the
next
there
are
children
everywhere
like
locusts
crawling
around
mindlessly
bent
on
feeding
and
mating
destroying
everything
in
sight
in
their
relentless
pointless
desire
to
exist
i
do
enjoy
these
pep
talks
have
you
ever
considered
given
your
abhorrence
of
children
school's
principal
was
not
perhaps
your
true
vocation
somebody's
got
to
keep
an
eye
on
them
they're
just
a
bunch
of
hormonal
time
bombs
every
time
a
pretty
girl
walks
by
every
boy
turns
into
a
gibbering
fool
ms
calendar
mr
giles
well
i
uh
um
hello
you
see
the
way
these
kids
gaze
at
each
other
all
moony
it's
good
to
see
you
yes
you
think
they're
thinking
about
learning
uh
were
you
headed
to
the
uh
faculty
room
sounds
like
fun
i
try
and
tell
'em
about
the
important
things
in
life
discipline
responsibility
punctuality
might
as
well
be
talking
to
myself
how
was
your
summer
extreme
i
did
burning
man
in
black
rock
ohhh
such
a
great
festival
you
should've
been
there
they
had
drum
rituals
mobile
sculptures
raves
naked
mud
dances
you
would've
just
hated
it
with
a
fiery
passion
i
can't
imagine
finding
any
redeeming
uh
naked
hmm
and
you
probably
spent
all
summer
with
your
nose
in
a
book
yes
i
suppose
you'd
consider
that
frightfully
dull
depends
on
the
book
giles
yo
gman
what's
up
nice
to
see
you
and
don't
ever
call
me
that
hi
kids
hi
how
are
you
live
and
kicking
buffy
killed
a
vampire
last
night
uh
i
think
you
can
get
a
little
more
volume
if
you
speak
from
the
diaphragm
sorry
we've
got
vampires
i
thought
the
hellmouth
was
closed
well
it's
it's
closed
but
not
gone
the
mystical
energy
that
emanates
from
it
is
still
concentrated
in
this
area
which
means
we're
still
the
undead's
favorite
party
town
i
wonder
if
they're
here
for
any
purpose
particularly
you're
the
watcher
i
just
work
here
yes
ii
must
consult
my
books
oh
eight
minutes
and
thirtythree
seconds
pay
up
i
called
ten
minutes
before
you'd
consult
your
books
about
something
thanks
we
better
get
to
class
oh
uh
buffy
uh
i
realize
you've
only
just
returned
but
when
you're
ready
ii
think
we
should
start
your
training
again
i'm
ready
i'll
see
you
after
school
well
iii
understand
if
if
you
want
a
few
days
to
i'm
ready
buffy
that's
enough
buffy
uh
safe
to
say
you've
stayed
in
shape
i'm
ready
whatever
they've
got
coming
next
i'm
ready
yeah
we
have
been
put
down
kinsmen
we
have
lost
our
way
we
have
lost
the
night
but
despair
is
for
the
living
where
they
are
weak
we
will
be
strong
where
they
weep
we
rejoice
where
they
bleed
we
drink
within
three
days
a
new
hope
will
arise
we
will
put
our
faith
in
him
he
will
show
us
the
way
buffy
buffy
fine
i'm
fine
good
it's
good
that
you're
fine
what
were
you
thinking
about
nothing
oh
c'mon
you
can
tell
us
we're
your
bosom
friends
the
friends
of
your
bosom
xander
i
wasn't
thinking
anything
really
what'd
you
do
last
night
mm
slept
i
had
weird
dreams
dreams
are
meaningful
tsh
tell
me
about
it
the
other
night
i
dreamt
that
xander
uh
iit
wasn't
xander
iin
fact
it
wasn't
me
it
was
a
friend's
dream
and
she
doesn't
remember
it
i
bet
she
doesn't
buffy
giles
what
is
it
you
look
worried
this
vampire
activity
i
think
i
know
what
they're
up
to
well
we'll
deal
with
it
i
hope
it's
that
simple
it
is
not
to
worry
trust
me
oh
i
don't
know
i
mean
i've
killed
you
once
it
shouldn't
be
too
difficult
to
do
it
again
what
hello
mind
if
i
come
in
be
my
guest
how
are
you
peachy
so
is
this
a
social
call
it
is
kinda
late
or
well
it
is
for
me
anyway
what
is
it
for
you
lunch
hour
it's
not
a
social
call
ah
so
lemme
guess
that
means
grave
danger
gosh
it's
good
to
be
home
i'm
sorry
i
wish
i
had
better
news
so
some
of
your
cousins
are
in
town
for
a
family
barbecue
and
we're
all
on
the
menu
the
anointed
one
he's
been
gathering
forces
somewhere
in
town
i'm
not
sure
why
guess
i'll
find
out
soon
enough
huh
you
don't
sound
too
concerned
i
can
handle
myself
besides
i
could
use
a
little
action
anyway
don't
underestimate
the
anointed
one
just
because
he
looks
like
a
child
he
has
power
over
the
rest
of
them
they'll
do
anything
for
him
is
that
it
is
that
everything
y'know
'cause
you
woke
me
up
from
a
really
good
dream
sorry
i'll
go
i
missed
you
i
missed
you
it
doesn't
matter
what
i
want

matter
if
i
cry
how
are
your
new
classes
good
don't
matter
if
i
bleed
good
is
there
the
slightest
chance
that
if
i
asked
you
what
was
wrong
you
would
tell
me
you've
been
on
a
road
course
not
it
would
take
all
the
fun
out
of
guessing

where
it
leads

like
i'm
not

i
don't
know
where
that
comes
from
what

you
contemplate
getting
over
yourself
for
a
second
there's
no
'us'
look
angel
i'm
sorry
if
i
was
supposed
to
spend
the
summer
mooning
over
you
but
i
didn't
i
moved
on
to
the
living
i'm
on
a
concrete
way
the
wind
is
blowing
hey
hi

to
the
northnorthwest

smells
like
sands
of
the
southern
island

black
cat

my
path

i'm
riding
on
a
camel
that
has
big
eyes
the
buildings
are
changing
into
coconut
trees
little
by
little
xander
did
i
ever
thank
you
for
saving
my
life
when
a
black
cat
no
crosses
my
path
a
woman
in
the

is
singing

don't
you
wish
i

la
la
la
la
buffy
you're
really
campaigning
for
bitchof
theyear
aren't
you
as
defending
champion
you
nervous
i
can
hold
my
own
you
know
we've
never
really
been
close
which
is
nice
'cause
i
don't
really
like
you
that
much
but
you
have
on
occasion
saved
the
world
and
stuff
so
i'm
gonna
do
you
a
favor
and
this
great
favor
is
i'm
gonna
give
you
some
advice
get
over
it
excuse
me
whatever
is
causing
the
joan
collins
'tude
deal
with
it
embrace
the
pain
spank
your
inner
moppet
whatever
but
get
over
it
'cause
pretty
soon
you're
not
even
gonna
have
the
loser
friends
you've
got
now
i
think
it's
about
time
you
start
minding
your
own
business
it's
long
past
nightynight
i'll
just
see
if
angel
feels
like
dancing
ms
ms
calendar
oh
god
ms
calendar
she's
possessed
possessed
that's
the
only
explanation
that
makes
any
sense
i
mean
you
should've
seen
her
last
night
that
wasn't
buffy
are
we
overlooking
the
idea
that
she
may
be
very
attracted
to
me
she's
possessed
possessed
by
what
aaaaa
possessing
thing
well
that
narrows
it
down
well
you're
the
expert
hey
maybe
when
the
master
killed
her
some
mystical
bad
guy
transference
thing
happened
that's
what
it
was
i
mean
why
else
would
she
be
acting
like
such
a
bitch
willow
i
think
we're
all
a
little
too
old
to
be
spelling
things
out
a
bitca
yes
i
suggest
that
uh
the
explanation
for
her
behavior
may
be
something
more
more
mundane
she
may
simply
have
what
you
americans
refer
to
as
issues
uh
her
experience
with
the
master
must
have
been
extremely
traumatic
well
she
was
for
at
least
a
few
minutes
technically
dead
ii
don't
think
she's
dealt
with
that
on
a
conscious
level
she's
convinced
herself
that
she's
invulnerable
for
the
very
reason
that
she
feels
that's
a
very
interesting
point
about
trout
you
just
brought
up
now
trout
trout
yes
trout
iis
a
fish
good
morning
did
you
sleep
well
like
a
rock
master's
gone
i'm
sorry
the
master
i
went
by
his
grave
last
night
and
they
have
a
vacancy
good
god
what
would
somebody
want
with
master
bones
a
trophy
a
horrible
conversation
piece
they're
gonna
bring
him
back
they're
gonna
bring
the
master
back
to
life
and
i
seem
to
recall
you
telling
me
he
was
history
buffy
iii've
never
heard
of
aa
revivification
ritual
being
successful
but
you've
heard
of
them
thanks
for
the
warning
well
buffy
giles
did
bury
him
and
look
this
is
slayer
stuff
okay
could
we
have
just
a
little
less
from
the
civilians
please
okay
that's
just
about
enough
i
believe
some
of
us
have
class
and
some
of
us
have
jobs
yyes
well
i'll
uh
i'll
see
you
all
uh
in
the
library
later
we'll
we'll
continue
this
discussion
about
trout
there're
some
things
i
can
just
smell
it's
like
a
sixth
sense
no
actually
that
would
be
one
of
the
five
that
summers
girl
i
smell
trouble
i
smell
expulsion
and
just
the
faintest
aroma
of
jail
well
before
you
throw
away
the
key
you
might
consider
giving
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
she
may
surprise
you
you
really
have
faith
in
those
kids
don't
you
yes
i
do
weird
alright
alright
iii've
got
something
it's
latin
so
bear
with
me
uh
to
revive
the
vampire
they
need
his
bones
uh
wwhich
they
have
and
um
the
blood
this
is
very
unclear
of
the
closest
person
uh
someone
connected
to
the
vampire
that'd
be
me
perhaps
we
were
close
we
killed
each
other
it
really
promotes
togetherness
well
is
there
anything
on
when
the
ceremony
might
take
whoa
this
is
cordelia's
'come
to
the
bronze
before
it
opens
or
we
make
her
a
meal'
xander
they're
gonna
cook
her
dinner
i'll
pretend
i
didn't
say
that
what
do
we
do
i
go
to
the
bronze
and
save
the
day
i
don't
like
this
nor
i
yeah
well
you
guys
aren't
going
what
do
you
mean
i
can't
do
it
anymore
i
can't
look
after
the
three
of
you
guys
while
i'm
fighting
well
what
about
the
rest
of
the
note
what
rest
of
the
note
the
part
that
says
'ps
this
is
a
trap'
you'll
be
playing
straight
into
their
hands
i
can
handle
this
stop
saying
that
god
what's
wrong
with
you
cordelia
may
be
dead
this
is
my
fight
y'know
being
stalked
isn't
really
a
big
turnon
for
girls
you
need
help
someone
to
watch
your
back
sure
you
don't
mean
my
neck
why
are
you
ridin'
me
because
i
don't
trust
you
you're
a
vampire
oh
i'm
sorry
was
that
an
offensive
term
should
i
say
'undead
american'
you
have
to
trust
someone
you
can't
do
this
alone
i
trust
me
you're
not
as
strong
as
you
think
you
think
you
can
take
me
what
oh
c'mon
i
mean
you
must've
thought
about
it
what
would
happen
if
it
ever
came
down
to
a
fight
you
vampire
me
the
slayer
i
mean
you
must've
wondered
well
why
don't
we
find
out
i'm
not
gonna
fight
you
come
on
kick
my
ass
don't
you
have
somewhere
to
be
i
do
well
you're
wasting
time
just
stay
out
of
my
way
happy
to
oblige
that's
not
cordelia
cordelia
couldn't
make
it
where
is
she
i'm
not
supposed
to
tell
i
don't
like
this
don't
like
what
there's
the
bait
where's
the
hook
you're
right
why
would
they
send
just
one
i
still
think
we
should've
gone
with
her
buffy's
about
to
lose
it
i
think
we
should
be
trying
to
reach
minimum
safe
distance
xander
you
know
it's
a
trap
ah
ah
ah
ah
uh
uh
the
latin
is
is
translated
from
the
sumerian
aaand
rather
badly
closest
to
the
master
actually
translates
as
'nearest'
physically
the
the
the
person
or
persons
who
were
with
him
when
he
it
is
a
trap
it
just
isn't
for
her
watch
her
don't
kill
her
unless
you
have
to
buffy
what's
goin'
on
i'll
be
back
xander
what
happened
vampires
the
ones
you
could
handle
yourself
where
are
the
others
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
what
your
problem
is
what
your
issues
are
but
as
of
now
i
officially
don't
care
if
you'd
worked
with
us
for
five
seconds
you
coulda
stopped
this
we
we
just
have
to
think
where
would
they
have
taken
them
if
they
hurt
willow
i'll
kill
you
why
did
they
take
them
and
not
you
giles
said
the
ritual
was
um
they
needed
people
who
were
close
to
the
master
physically
close
when
he
uh
the
ones
who
were
with
the
master
when
he
died
giles
willow
cordelia
ms
calendar
odds
are
they've
got
a
complete
set
by
now
we
need
to
find
out
where
how
one
more
time
where
are
they
you're
too
late
your
friends
are
dead
tell
me
where
they
are
what
are
you
gonna
do
kill
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
yes
but
since
i'm
not
gonna
kill
you
any
time
soon
the
question
becomes
how
are
we
gonna
pass
the
time
till
then
so
one
more
time
begin
behold
these
four
mortals
witnesses
to
our
master's
wretched
demise
they
will
breathe
their
last
this
night
the
blood
that
pours
from
their
throats
will
bring
new
life
to
the
old
one
we
gather
for
his
resurrection
for
the
dawn
of
this
new
hell
buffy
buffy
we
gotta
do
something
now
you
two
get
the
others
out
of
here

need
you
to
distract
the
vampires

what
are
you
gonna
do
i'm
gonna
kill
them
all
that
oughta
distract
them
for
the
old

the
dark
the
sacrifices

where's
buffy

she's
working
out
her
issues
enough

grind
you
into
a
sticky
paste
and
hear
you
beg
before
i
smash
in
your
face
so
are
you
gonna
kill
me

making
small
talk
it's
over
no
it's
not
it's
okay
it's
okay
what
an
ordeal
and
you
know
what
the
worst
part
is
what
it
stays
with
you
forever
no
matter
what
they
tell
you
none
of
that
rust
and
blood
and
grime
comes
out
i
mean
you
can
dryclean
till
judgment
day
you
are
living
with
those
stains
yeah
that's
the
worst
part
of
being
hung
upside
down
by
a
vampire
who
wants
to
slit
your
throat
the
stains
i
hear
ya
i
don't
think
i
can
face
them
hmm
of
course
you
can
i
can't
what
am
i
supposed
say
'sorry
i
almost
got
your
throat
slit
what's
the
homework'
giles
punishing
yourself
like
this
is
pointless
it's
entirely
pointy
i
was
a
moron
i
put
my
best
friends
in
mortal
danger
on
the
second
day
of
school
what
are
you
gonna
do
crawl
inside
a
cave
for
the
rest
of
your
life
would
it
have
cable
buffy
you
acted
wrongly
i
admit
that
but
believe
me
that
was
hardly
the
the
worst
mistake
you'll
ever
make
uh
that
wasn't
quite
as
comforting
as
it
was
meant
to
be
well
points
for
effort
see
ya
hey
buffy
hey
we
saved
you
a
seat
there's
a
rumor
going
around
that
uh
mr
cox
is
the
most
boring
teacher
in
the
entire
world
like
i
think
he
won
a
belt
or
something
like
yes
well
i
hear
he
nods
off
a
lot
so
that's
a
plus
so
we
bronzin'
it
tonight
wednesday
it's
kinda
beat
well
we
could
grind
our
enemies
into
talcum
powder
with
a
sledgehammer
but
gosh
we
did
that
last
night
hey
i
got
a
plan
how
'bout
miniature
golf
there's
no
course
here
okay
uh
miniature
tennis
a
very
tiny
form
of
tennis
that
we
could
invent
i
hate
that
girl
