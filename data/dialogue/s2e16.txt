what
do
you
think

do
you
think
cordelia
will
like
it
i
don't

she

what
one
of

are
you

find
somebody
more
better
uh
parallel
universe

only
other
person
i'm
interested
in
is
um
unavailable

uh

comfortable
silence

you

getting
along

this
is
new
territory
for
me
i

my
valentines
are

heartfelt
restraining
orders

love
it
i
wish
dating
was
like
slaying
you
know
simple
direct
stake
to
the
heart
no
muss
no
fuss
sorry
to
say
xand
slaying
is
a
tad
more
perilous
than
dating
well

obviously
not
dating
cordelia

just
a
cheap
gimmick
to

chocolate
bad
breakup
huh
believe
me
when
i
say
'uhhuh'
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
amy

just
hate
to
think
of
you
solo
on
valentine's
day
i'll
be
fine
mom
and
i
are
gonna
have
a
pigout
and
vid
fest

worked
some
magic
on
ms
beakman
you
mean
like
witchcraft
you
know
her
mom's
a
witch
and
an
amateur
psycho
amy's
the
last
person
that
should
be
messing
with
that
stuff
maybe
i
should
go
talk
to
her
buffy
buffy
might
i
have
a
word
have
a
sentence
even
oh
good
well
uh
back
it
up
before
you
leave
rupert
ms
calendar
i'm
glad
we
ran
into
each
other
actually
i
was
hoping
that
we
could
uh
do
you
have
a
minute
um
actually
not
not
just
now
um
right
let's
go
are
you
okay
me
iii'll
be
fine
um
i
was
more
concerned
about
you
actually
and
around
valentine's
day
he
he
he's
rather
prone
to
uh
well
um
brutal
displays
of
uh
he
would
think
of
it
as
affection
i
suppose
like
what
no
no
uh
no
need
to
go
into
details
that
bad
suffice
it
to
say
i
i
think
it
would
be
best
if
you
stayed
off
the
streets
for
a
few
nights
iii'll
um
i'll
patrol
and
keep
an
eye
on
things
better
safe
than
sorry
it's
a
little
late
for
both
fancy
it
pet
ahhh
it's
beautiful
mm
nothing
but
the
best
for
my
gir
happy
valentine's
day
dru
oh
angel
it's
still
warm
i
knew
you'd
like

found
it
in
a
quaint
little
shopgirl
cute
here
i'll
get
it
done
i
know
dru
gives
you
pity
access
but
you
have
to
admit
it's
so
much
easier
when
i
do
things
for
her
you
would
do
well
to
worry
less
about
dru
and
more
about
that
slayer
you've
been
tramping
around
with
dear
buffy
i'm
still
trying
to
decide
the
best
way
to
send
my
regards
why
don't
you
rip
her
lungs
out
it
might
make
an
impression
lacks
poetry
it
doesn't
have
to
what
rhymes
with
lungs
don't
worry
spike
angel
always
knows
what
speaks
to
a
girl's
heart
feeling
i've
been
lost
for
years
oz
smiles
over
at
willow
and
then
looks
down
at
his
guitar
you
can
never
understand
me
unless
you've
seen
those
tears
but
you
never
get
to
sleep
willow
looks
up
at
oz
and
smiles
oz
smiles
back
as
he
plays
when
i'm
away
i
don't
mind
the
deeper
oz
has
his
cool
hair
today
that
you
lay
willow
i
think
i'm
a
groupie
out
of
time
cut
to
cordelia
coming
out
of
the
restrooms

i
can't
sleep
she

sees
her
friends

get
outta
here

just
startled
me
a
little
i
was
just
checking
the
back
door
somebody
um
left
these
for
you
pain
i
can't
sleep
pain
i
can't
sleep
xander
looks
around
and
spots
cordelia
sitting
alone
at
a
table
pain
i
can't
sleep
he
slowly
gets
to
his
feet
and
walks
over
to
her
she
notices
him
coming
looks
at
him
and
stands
up
to
meet
him
the
song
is
over
now
hey
your
clothes
you
look
so
good
oh
i
let
buffy
dress
me
well
not
physically
perfect
you
had
to
make
this
harder
didn't
you
okay
clearly
the
fact
that
i
please
you
visually
has
got
us
off
on
the
wrong
foot
here
xander
let
me
finish
i've
been
thinking
a
lot
about
us
lately
the
why
and
the
wherefore
you
know
once
twice
a
kissy
here
a
kissy
there
and
you
can
chalk
it
all
up
to
hormones
aand
maybe
that's
all
we
have
here
tawdry
teen
lust
but
maybe
not
maybe
something
in
you
sees
something
special
inside
me
and
vice
versa
i
mean
i
think
i
do
see
something
so
xander
thank
you
it's
beautiful
i
wanna
break
up
okay
not
quite
the
reaction
i
was
looking
for
i
know
i'm
sorry
it's
just
who
are
we
kidding
even
if
parts
of
us
do
see
specialness
we
don't
fit
yeah
okay
do
you
know
what's
a
good
day
to
break
up
with
somebody
any
day
besides
valentine's
day
i
mean
what
were
you
running
low
on
dramatic
irony
i
know
i
didn't
mean
to
do
it
this
way
well
you
did
dude
way
to
get
dumped
ooo
buffy
my
bud
you
will
not
believe
can't
talk
right
now
angel
do
you
need
help
it's
alright
gee
xander
maybe
you
should
learn
a
second
language
so
that
even
more
girls
can
reject
you
what
are
you
doing
amy
good
to
see
you
you're
a
witch
no
i'm
not
that
that
was
my
mom
remember
yeah
i'm
thinking
it
runs
in
the
family
i
saw
you
working
that
mojo
on
ms
beakman
maybe
i
should
go
tell
somebody
about
that's
not
even
that
is
so
mean
blackmail
is
such
an
ugly
word
i
didn't
say
blackmail
yeah
but
i'm
about
to
blackmail
you
so
i
thought
i'd
bring
it
up

want
i
want
some
respect
around

the
point

after
you
no
i
mean
chop
me
into
little
pieces
and
stick
me
on
hooks
for
fish
to
nibble
at
'cause
it
would
be
more
fun
than
my
life
yeah
i
heard
about
you
and
cordy
that's
her
loss
yeah
not
really
the
popular
theory
you
know
what
i'd
like
why
don't
you
and
i
do
something
together
tonight
just
the
two
of
us
really
yeah
we
can
comfort
each
other
well
would
lap
dancing
enter
into
that
scenario
at
all
'cause
i
find
that
very
comforting
play
your
cards
right
okay
uh
you
do
know
that
i'm
xander
right
i
don't
know
i
just
heard
that
you
and
cordy
broke
up
and
i
guess
i
was
just
surprised
how
glad
i
was
it's
funny
how
you
can
see
someone
every
day
but
not
really
see
them
you
know
yeah
it's
funny
and
it's
just
gettin'
funnier
xander
can
i
talk
to
you
for
a
minute
yeah
okay
xander
yeah
i
don't
think
the
spell
worked
out
right
oh
yeah
it
bombed
no
biggie
well
we
can
always
try
again
i
am
still
pretty
new
at
this
oh
no
no
no
it's
okay
you
know
what
it
was
wrong
to
meddle
with
the
forces
of
darkness
i
see
that
now
i
think
we've
all
grown
i
gotta
go
oh
we
don't
have
to
cast
any
spells
we
can
just
hang
out
sure
what
well
i
liked
spending
time
with
you
you're
so
sweet
you
know
it's
funny
how
you
can
you
can
see
a
person
every
day
and
not
really
see
them
exactly
so
anyway
i
thought
it
might
hi
xander
what
you're
in
mr
baird's
history
class
right
yeah
i
thought
maybe
we
could
study
together
tonight
do
you
mind
we
were
talking
uh
i
really
gotta
go
right
now
sorry
i
wanted
to
surprise
you
good
job
high
marks
don't
be
so
jumpy
i've
been
in
your
bed
before
yeah
but
will
we
were
both
in
footy
pajamas
xand
i've
been
thinking
will
i
i
think
i
know
what
you've
been
thinking
but
this
is
all
my
fault
i
cast
a
spell
and
it
sort
of
backfired
how
long
have
we
been
friends
a
long
long
time
too
long
to
do
anything
that
might
change
that
now
well
friendships
change
all
the
time
people
grow
apart
they
grow
closer
uh
this
is
good
how
close
we
are
now
i
feel
very
comfortable
with
this
amount
of
closeness
in
fact
i
can
even
back
up
a
few
paces
and
still
be
happy
see
i
want
you
xander
to
be
my
first
baseman

you
make
me
sick
okay

you
two
sit
and
be
quiet
we
have
to
catch
the
buffy
rat
ooo
there
good
buffy
just
that
kinda
hurt
kinda
what
was
that
for
i
was
on
the
phone
all
night
listening
to
willow
cry
about
you
now
i
don't
know
exactly
what
happened
but
i
was
left
with
a
very
strong
urge
to
hit
you
i
didn't
touch
her
i
swear
xander
where's
buffy
amy
turned
her
into
a
rat
oh
i
don't
see
her
if
anything
happens
to
her
i'll
oh
just
go
home
lock
yourself
away
you're
only
going
to
cause
more
problems
here
now
amy
jenny
and
i
will
uh
try
and
break
the
spell
oz
if
if
you
could
aid
us
in
in
finding
um
buffy
sure
absolutely
just
go
get
out
of
my
sight
buffy
what
are
you
doing
you
guys
are
crazy
you
thought
you
could
do
better
is
that
it
no
i
we'll
knock
that
snotty
attitude
right
out
of
you
ow
stop
you
must
have
botched
the
ritual
so
that
cordelia's
necklace
actually
protected
her
from
the
spell
thththat
one
should
be
easily
reversible
wwwhere
did
you
learn
animal
transformation
why
did
you
send
xander
away
he
needs
me
that's
a
laugh
he
loves
me
we
look
into
each
other's
souls
no
one
can
love
two
people
at
once
what
we
have
is
real
instead
of
making
me
ill
why
doesn't
one
of
you
try
to
help
me
you
have
no
idea
what
i'm
going
through
i
know
it's
not
love
it's
obsession
selfish
banal
obsession
now
xander
has
put
himself
in
very
great
danger
if
you
cared
at
all
about
him
you'd
help
me
save
him
rather
than
wittering
on
about
your
feelings
now
let's
get
on
with
some
work
now
jenny
great
i
think
we
lost
'em
i
should've
known
i'd
find
you
with
her
will
come
on
you
don't
wanna
hurt
me
oh
no
you
don't
know
how
hard
this
is
for
me
i
love
you
so
much
i'd
rather
see
you
dead
than
with
that
bitch
get
away
from
him
he's
mine
okay
now
i
really
think
we've
lost
them
damn
it
xander
what's
going
on
who
died
and
made
you
buffy's
house
let's
get
inside
i'll
explain

all
scratched
up

bathroom

me
uh
get
you
something
to
drink
you
in
the
mood

so
tense
mm

are
you
doing
make

hands
off
me
and
keep
your
momaged
mitts
off
my
boyfriend
former
why

everyone
gone
insane
insane

it
so
impossible
for
you
to
believe
that
other
women
find
me
attractive
the
only
way
you
could
get
girls
to
want
you
would
be
witchcraft
that
is

a
well

none
of
this
would've
happened
if
you
hadn't
broken
up
with
me
but
no
you're
so
desperate
to
be
popular
me
i'm
not
the
one
who
embraced
the
black
arts
just
to
get
the
girls
to
like
me
well
congratulations
it
worked
would've
worked
fine
except
your
hide's
so
thick
not
even
magic
can
penetrate
it
you
mean
the
spell
was
for
me
oh
please
let
me
touch
you
goddess
of
creatures
great
and
small
i
conjure
thee
to
withdraw
hecate
i
hereby
license
thee
to
depart

no
more
thy
siren's
song

off
me
what's
going
on
where
am
i
what's
going
on
hi
oz
hi
i
seem
to
be
having
a
slight
case
of
nudity
here
but
you're
not
a
rat
so
call
it
an
upside
you
think
maybe
you
could
get
me
some
clothing
yes
i
can
just
uh
don't
go
anywhere
really
not
an
issue
what
what
did
we
boy
that
was
the
best
scavenger
hunt
ever
scavenger
hunt
your
mom
seemed
to
buy
it
so
she
says
i
think
she's
just
so
wigged
at
hitting
on
one
of
my
friends
that
she's
repressing
she's
getting
pretty
good
at
that
i
should
probably
start
worrying
well
i'm
back
to
being
incredibly
unpopular
it's
better
than
everyone
trying
to
axmurder
you
right
mostly
but
uh
willow
won't
even
talk
to
me
any
particular
reason
she
should
how
much
groveling
are
we
talking
here
oh
a
month
at
least
xander
come
on
i
mean
this
is
worse
for
her
than
anyone
she
loved
you
before
you
invoked
the
great
roofie
spirit
the
rest
of
us
you
remember
huh
oh
yeah
i
remember
coming
on
to
you
i
remember
begging
you
to
undress
me
and
then
a
sudden
need
for
cheese
i
also
remember
that
you
didn't
need
cheese
undress
me
it
meant
a
lot
to
me
what
you
said
c'mon
buffy
i
couldn't
take
advantage
of
you
like
that
okay
for
a
minute
it
was
touch
and
go
there
you
came
through
there
might
just
be
hope
for
you
yet

that
to
cordelia

on
your
own
there
