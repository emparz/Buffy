riley
buffy
what
are
you
doing
here
my
job
well
i
just
thought
you
were
in
the
north
sector
watch
out
never
mind
why
do
i
even
bother
to
show
up
spike
what
are
you
doing
here
same
thing
as
you
and
your
cub
scout
here
i'll
wager
a
spot
of
violence
before
bedtime
what
i
softened
him
up
better
keep
out
of
my
way
spike
i'm
not
gonna
take
this
much
longer
and
i
should
do
what
in
my
spare
time
sit
at
home
knitting
cunning
sweater
sets
would
it
keep
you
out
of
my
way
she's
right
you
shouldn't
be
out
here
when
she's
patrolling
oh
i
saw
that
looks
like
neither
boy's
entirely
welcome
you
should
take
him
home
slayer
make
him
stay
there
i've
got
knitting
needles
he
can
borrow
spike
i
just
saw
you
taste
your
own
nose
blood
you
know
what
i'm
too
grossed
out
to
hear
anything
you
have
to
say
go
home
it's
blood
it's
what
i
do
hey
hope
i
didn't
get
in
the
way
of
course
not
ii
was
just
startled
and
you
know
i
don't
love
the
idea
of
you
patrolling
alone
not
much
for
benchwarming
no
you
made
the
squad
you
threw
that
vampire
like
he
was
a
teenyweeny
little
vampire
hey
wanna
go
again
come
on
i
bet
this
place
is
just
teeming
with
aerodynamic
vampires
nah
unless
you
wanna
go
back
and
kill
spike
for
the
fun
of
it
i
will
know
your
blood
slayer
i
will
make
your
neck
my
chalice
and
drink
deep
ow
you
can't
possibly
be
arguing
that
marat
didn't
betray
the
french
revolutionaries
this
was
the
guy
who
declared
the
rights
of
man
and
then
the
next
thing
you
know
he's
killing
girondin
like
it's
going
out
of
style
will
you're
totally
missing
my
point
now
i
agree
that
marat
wasn't
a
real
martyr
but
the
death
in
the
tub
the
neck
wound
all
that
blood
just
a
little
more
fangy
than
knifey
i
mean
charlotte
corday
wasn't
a
real
martyr
either
but
buffy
what
listen
to
us
wewe're
arguing
we're
having
a
debate
about
a
college
lecture
i
have
dreamt
of
this
day
since
forever
you
are
turning
into
quite
the
student
should
i
be
watching
my
occipital
lobe
your
what
occipital
the
lobe
in
the
back
of
your
brain
you
know
like
should
i
be
watching
my
back
but
you
know
the
back
of
your
brain
apparently
not
don't
worry
will
you
still
wear
the
smartypants
in
the
family
i
don't
know
you've
been
studying
really
a
lot
i'm
trying
but
they're
really
piling
on
the
reading
and
giles
fills
any
free
time
i
have
with
extra
training
i'm
starting
to
think
this
working
hard
is
hard
work
isn't
it
crazy
like
that
i
thought
it
was
gonna
be
like
in
the
movies
you
know
inspirational
music
a
montage
me
sharpening
my
pencils
me
reading
writing
falling
asleep
on
a
big
pile
of
books
with
my
glasses
all
crooked
'cause
in
my
montage
i
have
glasses
but
real
life
is
slow
and
it's
starting
to
hurt
my
occipital
lobe
aw
poor
buffy's
brain
actually
i'm
heading
to
training
now
do
you
wanna
come
with
i'm
in
maybe
we
can
argue
some
more
about
the
french
revolution
hey
wasn't
that
robespierre
the
coolest
robespierre
you're
kidding
me
right
i'm
just
gettin'
it
goin'
it
seems
the
plans
worked
perfectly
yes
blueprints
not
a
bad
idea
that
and
getting
straight
measure
twice
cut
once
you
know
for
the
longest
time
i
had
it
backwards
messy
well
i
must
say
i'm
very
impressed
yeah
carpentry
is
pretty
cool
oh
who
put
the
monkey
heads
near
the
styx
water
do
we
want
to
pick
exploded
monkey
out
of
our
hair
trick
or
treat
hello
you
two
come
on
in
thank
you
kind
proprietor
hey
you
hey
oh
wow
this
place
looks
great
oh
i
feel
like
a
witch
in
a
magic
shop
ooh
are
these
real
newt
eyes
no
too
rich
for
my
blood
i'm
afraid
no
these
are
salamander
eyes
it's
the
cataracts
which
give
them
their
newtlike
appearance
they're
really
equally
effective
though
it's
just
a
matter
of
overcoming
snobberies
i'm
telling
you
giles
you
gotta
set
up
a
blind
taste
test
and
prove
once
and
for
all
that
generic
amphibian
eyeballs
are
just
as
good
i
don't
know
if
you
ask
me
the
newt
name
still
means
something
you
ready
to
train
you
betcha
shall
we
then
we
shall
then
i
just
keep
thinking
how
cool
it
would
be
if
we
got
a
real
psychic
to
sit
up
here
and
read
fortunes
and
stuff
you
should
do
it
not
me
but
but
i'd
love
to
to
watch
and
learn
from
someone
who's
really
good
you
know
you're
really
good
i'll
prove
it
here
do
me
hmm

a
stake
she
won't
give
up
until
she's
killed
me
to
death
buffy's
looking
for
you
of
course
that's
why
i'm
on
the
lam
didn't
you
hear
i'm
totally
her
archnemesis
is
that
right
i
must
have
missed
the
memo
there
was
a
mem
spike
oh
my
god
this
is
like
a
real
emergency
uhh
i
need
a
hideout
so
bad
you're
my
only
hope
we're
just
gonna
have
to
rise
above
our
petty
differences
listen
spike
i'm
desperate
desperate
are
you
come
on
spike
pretty
please
i'll
do
anything
anything
will
you
yeah
i
said
i'll
do
anything
ohhhh
you
mean
will
i
have
sex
with
you
well
yeah
taking
up
smoking
are
you
i
am
a
villain
spike
hellooooo
i
guess
you
are
at
that
what
with
the
slayer
on
your
tail
and
all
she's
not
the
type
to
give
up
either
she'll
hunt
you
down
day
and
night
till
you're
too
tired
and
too
hungry
to
run
any
more
and
then
then
that
is
you
i
guess
you're
gonna
have
to
kill
her
i
tried
it
was
all
hard
and
stuff
you
do
it
i'd
love
to
but
i
can't
remember
i've
got
this
cute
little
government
chip
in
my
head
oh
right
guess
it'll
have
to
be
me
after
all
can
you
help
with
the
thinking
yeah
i
suppose
i
could
do
that
yeah
mm
that
was
relaxing
you
uh
wanna
relax
some
more
again
right
away
again
maybe
you're
too
tired
hey
i
have
the
endurance
of
ten
men
let's
make
it
women
okay
just
for
the
imagery
whatever
you
know
it
takes
a
lot
to
wear
me
out
oh
i
love
a
challenge
mm
well
wouldn't
you
every
kid
tries
to
make
the
substitute
cry
it's
like
a
rite
of
passage
i
certainly
would
not
being
a
substitute
is
an
extremely
difficult
job
besides
honestly
dawn
how
many
bowls
of
cereal
are
you
planning
on
eating
oh
these
aren't
for
eating
i'm
just
trying
to
get
the
extra
out
of
the
way
so
i
could
get
this
anyway
i
want
eggs
you
want
the
cereal
prize
but
you
don't
want
the
cereal
you
are
growing
up
all
righty
half
an
omelette
coming
up
oh
um
with
ketchup
if
you
please
mmhmm
oh
what
is
the
who
are
you
hey
how's
mom
are
you
okay
i'm
okay
and
your
mom's
doing
just
fine
this
is
ben
he
gave
me
his
stethoscope
lent
you
his
stethoscope
buffy
right
i'm
ben
i'm
an
intern
here
i've
had
the
pleasure
of
hanging
out
with
the
renowned
dr
dawn
here
while
your
mom's
being
tested
so
what's
goin'
on
what
happened
well
she's
doing
okay
now
the
doctors
don't
really
know
what
caused
the
collapse
it
could've
just
been
a
dizzy
spell
low
blood
sugar
that
sort
of
thing
but
it's
nothing
bad
i
i
mean
it's
not
serious
right
very
unlikely
so
your
mom
doesn't
have
a
history
of
fainting
no
i
mean
not
that
i
know
of
she's
usually
really
healthy
well
i
think
they'll
be
running
tests
for
a
few
more
hours
then
they'll
probably
want
her
to
come
back
for
some
followup
tests
in
a
couple
weeks
but
it
really
doesn't
look
like
anything
too
serious
oh
thank
god
i
was
freaking
out
i
think
you'll
be
able
to
take
her
home
before
too
long
well
that
is
definitely
good
news
i
know
i'm
repeating
myself
here
but
i
don't
know
what
else
to
say
to
convince
you
i
have
never
in
all
my
years
of
medicine
let
a
patient
with
tachycardia
this
severe
leave
a
hospital
you
said
you
couldn't
keep
me
legally
no
i
can't
force
you
to
do
a
thing
but
with
that
pulse
believe
me
i'd
get
on
my
knees
and
beg
you
if
i
thought
i
could
change
your
mind
you
can't
i'm
going
home
and
your
friend
here
can't
convince
you
to
riley
holds
up
a
hand
to
stop
her
i'm
going
all
right
then
but
you're
leaving
against
my
recommendation
what's
going
on
what
are
you
doing
what
if
you
have
a
heart
attack
listen
to
me
calm
down
me
calm
down
i'm
not
the
one
with
a
pulse
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
my
heart's
different
than
yours
buffy
it
works
differently
now
but
it's
okay
but
you're
still
a
human
riley
you
could
still
have
a
heart
attack
i'm
a
human
who
was
used
as
a
lab
rat
for
months
hi
hey
how
are
you
oh
embarrassed
mostly
i'm
sorry
to
put
you
through
this
but
no
more
tests
so
you
can
take
this
pincushion
home
yes
let's
uh
get
outta
here
what
about
a
crossword
some
people
say
feed
a
cold
i
say
puzzle
it
oh
no
thanks
willow
i
like
chicken
fingers
with
mustard
when
i'm
sick
i
know
you
do
sweetie
i
can
make
us
some
later
oh
uhuh
you
are
sitting
right
here
on
this
couch
today
i
feel
silly
lying
here
like
a
lump
you
could
make
a
game
out
of
it
aa
very
quiet
game
about
being
a
lump
i
feel
fine
honestly
i'm
more
concerned
about
riley
than
i
am
about
me
you
shouldn't
even
be
thinking
about
that
he's
not
worried
so
i
don't
think
we
should
be
i
don't
get
what
he's
thinking
why
isn't
he
worried
maybe
he
thinks
his
body
can
handle
it
he
is
in
really
good
shape
nobody's
body
can
handle
a
heart
attack
i
know
i'm
sorry
buffy
i'm
trying
too
hard
to
make
it
okay
i
just
keep
coming
back
to
the
initiative
it
does
have
that
icky
government
feel
to
it
did
you
know
that
one
time
the
cia
tried
to
kill
fidel
castro
with
poisonous
aspirin
dawn
please
i
know
i
have
to
do
something
i
just
don't
know
what
another
time
the
cia
buffy
dawn
it's
important
tried
to
make
castro
go
crazy
by
putting
itching
powder
in
his
beard
it's
about
the
government
call
the
initiative
if
they
know
what's
wrong
with
him
they
have
to
help
yeah
but
call
them
how
first
of
all
they
don't
exist
any
more
and
secondly
they
never
claimed
to
exist
in
the
first
place
it's
so
unfair
i
mean
iit's
like
big
brother
can
spy
on
you
all
the
time
andand
the
second
i
have
something
to
say
no
one
will
listen
sounds
more
like
big
sister
there
has
to
be
a
way
like
what
take
a
tour
of
the
white
house
and
pretend
to
get
lost
and
look
for
some
door
with
a
sign
on
it
that
says
secret
government
monster
hunters
if
they're
really
spying
on
you
all
the
time
you
just
say
something
so
you
know
they'll
hear
you
like
sometimes
i
write
fake
things
in
my
diary
in
case
i
gotta
go
uh
see
you
guys
later
what'd
i
say
riley
riley's
in
trouble
he
needs
help
no
way
man
i'm
out
graham
riley
can
we
talk
agent
goodman
agent
brown
so
talk
what's
goin'
on
man
you
gotta
get
this
taken
care
of
immediately
we
gotta
get
you
into
an
operating
room
very
convincing
makes
me
completely
wanna
put
myself
under
government
control
please
take
me
where
they
can
make
me
unconscious
and
naked
hey
you
think
i'd
pull
something
on
you
you're
still
in
i'm
out
i
don't
know
what
orders
you're
following
oh
come
on
you
know
walsh
pumped
all
those
chemicals
and
crap
into
us
you
got
more
than
anyone
she
messed
us
up
bad
and
now
the
government's
knocking
themselves
out
to
kiss
it
and
make
it
better
riley
i'm
tellin'
you
you
need
help
i'm
not
saying
it
to
trick
you
maybe
you
even
believe
it
i
know
it
you
don't
want
this
you're
sure
you
got
the
fix
for
it
yeah
we
got
a
guy
a
doctor
he's
gonna
take
care
of
you
and
we're
going
to
him
now
i'm
not
givin'
you
a
choice
i
guess
you're
not
so
you
messed
up
and
now
he's
gone
and
when
are
you
even
gonna
tell
me
what's
wrong
with
him
i'm
not
permitted
to
say
say
hyperadrenal
overload
and
a
bunch
of
stuff
that
sounds
even
worse
than
that
and
all
it
means
is
he's
way
stronger
than
he
oughta
be
and
feeling
no
pain
his
heart
can't
take
it
we've
been
at
him
for
weeks
about
it
there's
a
specialist
waiting
at
sunnydale
general
fourth
floor
neurology
get
riley
there
if
you
don't
buffy
i'll
get
him
there
i'll
tell
the
doc
buffy
if
you
tell
me
to
hurry
i'll
kick
your
ass
poor
riley
could
he
have
simply
gone
back
to
his
apartment
no
he's
not
at
his
apartment
he's
not
at
the
gym
he's
not
at
the
library
he's
gone
somewhere
where
he
doesn't
wanna
be
found
so
basically
he's
gone
awol
basically
exactly
poor
buffy
maybe
he
just
needs
some
time
alone
like
i
had
this
friend
once
who
really
liked
this
girl
and
he
got
all
worried
that
maybe
she
didn't
like
him
back
and
maybe
that
made
him
act
like
a
total
jerk
maybe
riley
reminds
me
of
that
friend
what
are
you
talking
about
then
again
maybe
not
maybe
he
just
wants
attention
well
here's
a
hot
tip
if
you
want
attention
be
there
so
people
can
give
it
to
you
i
care
about
you
xander
thanks
don't
be
insecure
thanks
i
won't
and
i
also
have
this
friend
and
uh
i
have
it
on
really
good
authority
that
she
really
likes
that
guy
your
friend
and
by
the
by
my
friend
buffy
you
guys
enough
okay
riley
is
in
real
danger
here
anya
xander
why
don't
you
guys
check
the
docks
aye
aye
tara
and
i
can
scope
out
the
burnedout
school
riley
hid
there
once
maybe
he
feels
it's
homey
or
something
homey
you
know
what
else
he
might
find
homey
in
a
dank
unpleasant
evil
sort
of
way
the
initiative
caves
i
don't
know
them
too
well
we
do
have
an
associate
who
knows
those
caves
like
the
back
of
his
melanindeprived
hand
i
so
don't
want
to
deal
with
spike
right
now
that
guy
is
really
starting
to
bug
me
in
that
special
i
wanna
shove
something
wooden
through
his
heart
kinda
way
he
does
seem
extra
twitchy
lately
maybe
the
whole
not
killing
is
gettin'
to
him
plus
hanging
out
all
day
in
that
moldy
crypt
you
just
know
he's
doing
something
nasty
okay
is
it
bigger
than
a
breadbox
no
four
left
so
it's
smaller
than
a
breadbox
no
only
three
harmony
is
it
a
sodding
breadbox
yes
oh
my
god
someone's
blondie
bear
is
a
twentyquestion
genius
she's
found
me
i've
got
a
proposition
for
you
funny
i've
got
a
proposition
for
you
what
about
knocking
seems
only
fair
since
we
vamps
can't
enter
your
flat
without
an
invite
you
could
at
least
say
look
at
those
pretty
pieces
of
paper
riley's
sick
with
some
initiative
thing
and
he's
missing
i
think
he
might
be
in
the
caves
you
find
him
bring
him
to
the
fourth
floor
of
the
hospital
their
doctors
get
to
him
in
time
you
get
the
cash
oh
dear
is
the
enormous
hall
monitor
sick
tell
me
is
he
gonna
die
he
is
not
the
only
person
that
can
die
hey
i'm
just
saying
if
it's
really
that
important
to
you
i
think
i'll
get
half
now
so
what'd
she
say
about
me
any
word
they'll
be
here
any
minute
that's
soon
enough
right
i
mean
if
we
bring
him
in
now
i'll
be
honest
i'm
not
sure
it's
soon
enough
if
you
brought
him
in
yesterday
finally
you
got
yourself
a
new
patient
doc
look
you
don't
understand
this
is
a
complicated
neurological
procedure
and
i've
never
performed
it
before
little
performance
anxiety
eh
doc
butterflies
in
the
old
belly
harm
do
us
a
favor
shoot
the
nasty
butterflies
for
the
good
doctor
there
you
go
it's
not
so
complicated
just
do
whatever
those
initiative
lab
monkeys
did
only
backwards
this
is
a
medical
school
not
a
proper
operating
facility
these
instruments
they
look
pointy
enough
they'll
do
you're
not
listening
that
chip
is
deeply
imbedded
in
your
cerebral
cortex
removing
it
could
leave
you
a
vegetable
that's
not
gonna
happen
mate
see
i
have
faith
in
your
survival
instinct
yeah
you'll
have
me
up
and
killing
before
the
night's
over
come
on
doc
you'll
do
me
right
nothing
bad'll
happen
to
you
oops
string
was
slippy
riley
this
place
kinda
creeps
me
out
you
shoulda
been
here
when
it
was
a
school
riley
oof
darkness
piles
of
it
we
shoulda
brought
a
flashlight
ooh
i
know
better
to
light
a
candle
than
curse
the
damn
darkness
a
little
spell
fiat
lux
wow
there
that's
better
riley
come
on
out
how'd
you
do
that
with
the
light
oh
you
know
you
taught
me
i
taught
you
teeny
tinkerbell
light
okay
so
i
tinkered
with
the
tinkerbell
it
was
easy
and
besides
isn't
this
better
than
using
a
flashlight
like
some
kind
of
doofus
riley
riley
answer
me
please
riley
you
know
this
doesn't
even
hurt
your
hand
is
bleeding
don't
feel
a
thing
this
stops
now
i'm
taking
you
to
the
doctor
the
one
from
the
government
you
mean
like
the
ones
who
did
this
to
me
in
the
first
place
he's
the
only
one
that
understands
what's
wrong
with
you
he's
the
only
one
that
can
help
what's
wrong
with
me
i'm
more
powerful
than
i've
ever
been
buffy
most
people
would
kill
to
feel
this
way
yeah
and
this
feeling
is
going
to
kill
you
riley
your
body
was
not
built
for
this
kind
of
strength
riley
i
can
handle
it
this
is
my
deal
buffy
just
back
off
what
is
this
what's
happening
to
you
i
go
back
let
the
government
get
whimsical
with
my
innards
again
they
could
do
anything
that
bestcase
scenario
they
turn
me
into
joe
normal
just
just
another
guy
and
that's
not
enough
for
you
it's
not
enough
for
you
why
would
you
say
that
come
on
your
last
boyfriend
wasn't
exactly
a
civilian
so
that's
what
this
is
about
you're
going
to
die
all
over
some
macho
pissing
contest
it's
not
about
him
it's
about
us
you're
getting
stronger
every
day
more
powerful
i
can't
touch
you
every
day
you're
just
a
little
further
out
of
my
reach
you
wanna
touch
me
i'm
right
here
i'm
not
the
one
running
away
not
yet
so
you
have
this
all
figured
out
i'm
bailing
because
you're
not
in
the
super
club
it's
human
nature
don't
psych
101
me
not
now
not
after
everything
that
nobody
has
ever
known
me
the
way
you
do
nobody
i've
opened
up
to
you
in
ways
that
i've
never
opened
up
to
god
you're
just
sitting
back
there
thinking
that
none
of
this
means
anything
to
me
i
never
said
that
because
it
obviously
doesn't
mean
anything
to
you
do
you
really
think
so
little
of
me
riley
buffy
no
no
do
you
think
that
i
spent
the
last
year
with
you
because
you
had
super
powers

that's
what
i
wanted
then
i'd
be
dating
spike

need
you
i
need
you
with
me
and
i
need
you
healthy

don't
trust
me

to
hurry

the
scariest
thing

ever
done

don't
know
why

doctor
