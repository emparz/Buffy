just
me
sorry
can
i
get
you
anything
no
thank
you
riley
no
i'm
fine
what
time
is
it
there's
a
clock
behind
you
will
i
know
but
there's
a
watch
right
above
your
hand
that
can't
be
right
oh
i
can't
stand
this
what's
taking
so
long
it
doesn't
mean
anything
you
think
i'd
worry
more
if
your
mom
was
out
of
surgery
quickly
might
mean
that
you
know
they
couldn't
do
much
okay
your
mom's
in
recovery
what
happened
is
she
all
right
it
was
possible
to
visualize
the
tumor
completely
which
means
i
was
able
to
get
all
of
it
so
barring
complications
in
recovery
i
think
your
mother's
going
to
be
fine
of
course
we're
still
going
to
have
to
watch
your
mother
carefully
and
uh
have
her
back
in
here
for
some
followup
testing
but
uh
overall
i'd
consider
the
procedure
a
complete
success
oh
my
goodness
doctor
thank
you
thank
you
so
much
please
it's
my
pleasure
sorry
sorry
when
i
was
younger
i
used
to
put
my
chopsticks
in
my
mouth
like
this
and
then
buffy
would
chase
me
around
the
house
yelling
'i'm
the
slayer
i'm
going
to
get
you'
that's
disturbing
you're
emotionally
scarred
and
will
end
up
badly
no
it
was
great
i
mean
she
didn't
actually
stake
me
in
the
heart
you
know
buffy's
pretty
cool
like
that
so
what
do
you
wanna
do
now
dawnster
keeping
in
mind
that
i
won't
chase
you
because
i'm
old
and
i'm
stuffed
full
of
moo
goo
gai
starch
well
we
could
play
that
game
again
life
that
was
fun
for
you
you
always
win
well
we
can
make
a
wager
this
time
you
can
give
me
real
money
that
would
be
different
and
after
we
teach
her
to
gamble
maybe
we
can
all
get
drunk
i
don't
think
the
bar
would
serve
her
but
we
could
bring
something
in
strawberry
schnapps
taste
just
like
real
ice
cream
okay
how's
about
a
movie
they're
showing
them
in
theaters
now
i
hear
it's
like
watching
a
video
with
a
bunch
of
strangers
and
a
sticky
floor
that
one
looks
sad
the
chimp
playing
hockey
is
that
based
on
the
chekhov
there's
a
chimp
playing
hockey
um
no
the
other
one
i
don't
wanna
see
a
sad
movie
we
have
to
see
the
chimp
playing
hockey
that's
hilarious
the
ice
is
so
slippery
and
and
monkeys
are
all
irrational
we
have
to
see
this
you
pick
dawn
this
is
your
night
we
are
celebrating
your
mom's
good
news

monkey

can
boink
no

not
that's
not
it
at
all
they
just
need
time
to
uh
be
tender
relax
he's
not
very
convincing
is
he
'alone
time'
always
translates
into
'get
dawn
out
of
the
house
so
we
can
have
loud
obnoxious
sex'
xander
looks
like
he
wants
to
object
but
doesn't
anya
smiles
then
suddenly
realizes
something
oh
does
that
mean
we
can't
can
we
put
this
song
on
repeat
whatever
you
want
can
we
put
the
whole
night
on
repeat

can't
believe
how
relaxed
i
feel
it's
like
all
the
tension's
just
left
my
body

a
long

back
we're
not

we're
army
just
like

damn
what
makes
monsters
tick
we

real
deal
high

and
maybe
not
midnight
tomorrow
the
decision's
yours
and
so
it
begins
no
longer
a
victim
of
crass
holiday
commercialization
i'm
a
purveyor
of
it
oh
who
ordered
more
chickens'
feet
the
ones
we
have
aren't
moving
at
all
that's
generally
what
happens
when
you
cut
them
off
the
chicken
i'm
serious
maybe
we
could
do
a
holiday
promotion
one
free
with
every
purchase
oh
yeah
dear
holiday
memories
merry
tykes
by
the
fire
enjoying
their
new
christmas
chicken
feet
aw
holding
them
tight
as
they
fall
asleep
painting
their
little
toenails
that's
so
very
humorous
make
fun
of
the
exdemon
i
can
just
hear
you
in
private
'i
dislike
that
anya
she's
newly
human
and
strangely
literal'
willow
anya
i
don't
say
that
no
one
says
that
no
one
talks
that
way
there's
nothing
wrong
with
my
idea
anyway
i've
been
very
good
for
this
store
if
it
wasn't
for
me
giles
would
be
a
terrified
old
man
staring
at
a
quarterly
tax
statement
and
wetting
himself
i
say
that's
an
exaggeration
anya
you've
helped
out
a
lot
but
i
have
too
yes
i
forgot
about
all
the
vigorous
sitting
around
anya
you
can
back
off
a
little
you
get
paid
willow's
doing
this
on
her
own
time
i'm
sorry
willow
thank
you
for
making
time
in
your
busy
life
to
come
in
here
and
get
in
the
way
of
mine
anya
play
nice
you
know
fine
take
her
side
instead
of
mine
even
though
i'm
the
one
who
sleeps
with
you
and
feeds
you
bathes
you
she
bathes
you
only
in
an
erotic
penthousey
way
not
in
a
spongebathy
geriatric
sort
of
please
stop
i
beg
of
you
i
need
to
find
out
everything
i
can
about
a
vamp
nest
downtown
a
nest
what
sort
of
buffy
there
were
people
there
it
um
it
looked
like
they
were
paying
vampires
to
bite
them
now
i
know
what
to
get
for
the
person
who
has
everything
who
would
pay
to
get
bitten
oh
that's
been
going
on
for
centuries
humans
hire
vampires
to
feed
off
them
they
well
you
know
theythey
get
off
on
the
rush
and
the
hazards
of
the
underworld
can
become
addictive
to
some
people
why
don't
the
vampires
just
kill
'em
because
they
get
cash
hot
and
cold
running
blood
and
they
don't
leave
any
corpses
behind
so
they
don't
get
hunted
but
still
iit
can
be
terribly
dangerous
for
humans
i
mean
people
can
end
up
dying
accidentally
or
or
meeting
a
a
vampire
who
only
pretends
to
play
by
the
house
rules
you
knew
about
this
and
you
didn't
tell
me
i
hadn't
seen
it
since
my
ripper
days
i
had
no
idea
it
was
going
on
in
sunnydale
well
it
is
and
i'm
gonna
stop
it
buffy
even
if
i
had
known
about
this
i
might
not
have
told
you
right
now
what
why
well
i'm
not
sure
this
is
where
your
efforts
are
best
spent
perhaps
you
should
focus
on
a
less
ambiguous
evil
glory
for
instance
you
said
people
are
dying
they're
willing
victims
i
mean
there
are
people
out
there
who
deserve
your
help
who
aren't
vampires
are
vampires
and
my
job
description
is
pretty
clear
are
you
coming
with
me
or
not
what's
the
rush
buff
if
we're
going
into
a
nest
maybe
we
should
come
up
with
a
strategy
wait
for
riley
back
me
up
or
not
i'm
going
anya
will
you
mind
the
store
have
a
nice
day
don't
get
killed
i
don't
understand
this
place
was
doing
serious
business
last
night
well
i
guess
everybody
jumped
ship
once
the
word
got
out
that
the
slayer
found
their
crib
i
just
want
to
apologize
for
the
use
of
the
word
'crib'
buffy
do
you
think
they'll
set
up
shop
again
in
town
it's
hard
to
say
i'm
sure
they'll
lie
low
for
a
bit
but
they're
around
somewhere
there's
gotta
be
a
way
to
find
these
creeps
don't
worry
buff
you'll
find
them
yeah
i'm
sure
you'll
get
them
next
time
champ
what
took
you
guess
it
takes
a
while
to
get
back
to
full
strength
after
those
bites
hey
hey
let's
be
reasonable
about
this
you
may
have
noticed
spike
i
left
reasonable
about
three
exits
back
look
i'm
not
the
one
who
got
you
into
this
don't
kill
the
messenger
why
the
hell
not
ow
bloody
hell
oh
god
hey
plastic
woodgrain
looks
real
doesn't
it
don't
think
i
don't
know
what's
goin'
on
with
you
spike
stay
away
from
her
or
we'll
do
this
for
real
next
time
oh
man
you
are
really
under
it
aren't
you
what
look
at
you
all
afraid
i'm
hot
for
your
honey
because
you
are
well
yeah
but
that's
not
your
problem
even
if
i
wasn't
in
the
picture
you're
never
gonna
be
able
to
hold
onto
her
ow
bloody
hell
maybe
i
didn't
almost
kill
you
enough
come
on
you're
not
the
long
haul
guy
and
you
know
it
shut
up
you
know
it
or
else
you
wouldn't
be
getting
suck
jobs
from
twobit
vampire
trulls
the
girl
needs
some
monster
in
her
man
and
that's
not
in
your
nature
no
matter
how
low
you
try
to
go
you
actually
think
you've
got
a
shot
with
her
no
i
don't
fella's
gotta
try
though
gotta
do
what
he
can
riley
if
you
touched
her
you
know
i'd
kill
you
for
real
i
had
this
chip
outta
my
head
i'da
killed
you
long
ago
ain't
love
grand
sometimes
i
envy
you
so
much
it
chokes
me
and
sometimes
i
think
i
got
the
better
deal
to
be
that
close
to
her
and
not
have
her
to
be
all
alone
even
when
you're
holding
her
feeling
her
feeling
her
beneath
you
surrounding
you
the
scent

no
you
got
the
better
deal
i'm
the
lucky
guy
yeah
i'm
the
guy
how
long
has
she
been
in
there
a
while
now
seems
pretty
gungho
about
it
too
didn't
even
stop
to
say
hello
yeah
when
we
went
to
deal
with
that
vampire
nest
she
got
all
rambo
and
torched
the
place
something
seriously
bad
is
going
on
with
her
oh
i
don't
know
maybe
you're
overreacting
i
mean
who
hasn't
done
stuff
like
that
from
time
to
time
i
mean
i
made
this
one
guy
spontaneously
combust
and
he
set
his
whole
village
on
fire
can
you
stop
being
scary
for
a
minute

listen
to
what
i'm
trying
to
tell
you

training

take
care
of
we
need
to
talk
i'm
not
ready
to
talk
to
you
yet
too
bad
i'm
serious
unless
you
wanna
fight
so
let's
fight
we
need
to
have
this
out
buffy
right
now
and
say
what
riley
'what
were
you
thinking
how
long
have
you
been
lying
to
me'
nothing
you
say
right
now
is
gonna
make
this
better
i
realize
that
i
don't
expect
i
just
need
you
to
hear
me
out
fine
get
your
hand
off
of
me
i
think
when
this
thing
started
it
was
just
some
stupid
immature
game
i
wanted
to
even
the
score
after
you
let
dracula
bite
you
i
did
not
let
dracula
riley
i
know
on
some
level
i
know
that
but
i
was
still
spun
i
don't
know
i
i
wanted
to
know
what
you
felt
i
wanted
to
know
why
dracula
and
angel
have
so
much
power
over
you
you
so
don't
get
it
i
wanted
to
get
it
buffy
i
wanted
to
get
you
so
this
is
my
fault
hey
gee
buffy's
so
mysterious
i
think
i'll
go
out
and
almost
die
i
think
i'll
go
and
let
some
other
w
this
isn't
your
fault
it's
mine
i
feel
like
hell
for
what
i've
put
you
through
it's
just
these
girls
buffy
vampires
killers
they
made
me
feel
something
buffy
something
i
didn't
even
know
i
was
missing
until
buffy
i
can't
i
can't
hear
this
you
need
to
hear
this
fine
fine
tell
me
about
your
whores
tell
me
what
on
earth
they
were
giving
you
that
i
can't
they
needed
me
they
needed
your
money
it
wasn't
about
you
no
on
some
basic
level
it
was
about
me
my
blood
my
body
when
they
bit
me
it
was
beyond
passion
they
wanted
to
devour
me
all
of
me
why
are
you
telling
me
this
it
wasn't
real
i
know
it
was
just
physical
but
the
fact
that
i
craved
it
that
that
i
kept
going
back
even
if
it
was
fleeting
they
made
me
feel
like
they
had
such
hunger
for
me
and
i
don't
make
you
feel
that
way
how
on
earth
can
you
compare
me
to
that
how
can
you
tell
me
you
understand
what
those
vampires
are
feeling
you
aren't
a
passion
to
them
you
are
a
snack
a
willing
idiotic
snack
no
i
know
exactly
what
they
feel
when
they
bite
me
because
i
feel
it
every
time
we're
together
it's
like
the
whole
world
falls
away
and
all
there
is
is
you
and
you
think
that
i
don't
feel
the
same
way
about
you
how
dare
you
tell
me
what
i
feel
you
keep
me
at
a
distance
buffy
you
didn't
even
call
me
when
your
mom
went
into
the
hospital
oh
i'm
sorry
you
know
um
i'm
sorry
that
i
couldn't
take
care
of
you
when
i
thought
that
my
mother
was
dying
it's
about
me
taking
care
of
you
it's
about
letting
me
in
so
you
don't
have
to
be
on
top
of
everything
all
the
time
but
i
do
that's
part
of
what
being
a
slayer
is
and
that's
what
this
is
really
about
isn't
it
you
can't
handle
the
fact
that
i'm
stronger
than
you
it's
hard
sometimes
yeah
but
that's
not
it
then
what
what
else
do
you
want
from
me
riley
i've
given
you
everything
that
i
have
i've
given
you
my
heart
my
body
and
soul
you
say
that
but
i
don't
feel
it
i
just
don't
feel
it
well
whose
fault
is
that
because
i'm
telling
you
this
is
it
this
is
me
this
is
the
package
and
if
it's
so
deficient
that
you
need
to
get
your
kicks
elsewhere
then
we
really
have
a
problem
they
want
me
back
buffy
the
military
it's
deep
undercover
no
contact
with
civilians
transport's
leaving
tonight
tonight
when
were
you
gonna
tell
me
about
this
i'm
telling
you
now
are
you
going
i
don't
know
if
we
can't
work
this
out
then
what
this
is
goodbye
you
are
unbelievable
you're
giving
me
an
ultimatum
no
i'm
not
yes
you
are
you
expect
me
to
get
over
it
now
or
you're
gone
i
don't
buffy
that's
not
what
i
meant
well
i
have
heard
enough
i
will
not
take
the
blame
for
this
i'm
not
asking
you
to
let
go
of
me
or
what
you'll
hit
me

ahead
come
on
do
it
get
out
of
my
way

leaving
buffy
unless
you
give
me
a
reason
to
stay
i'm
leaving
tonight
the
pyro
act
was
a
bad
idea
slayer
felt
pretty
good
to
me
i'm
not
running
and
you're
not
shutting
me
down
in
fact
you're
not
gonna
make
it
through
the
night
blackout
walk
away
i'm
serious
don't
do
this
not
now
so
how'd
that
work
out
for
ya
make
you
feel
better
what
are
you
doing
here
i
thought
you
might
need
to
talk
then
i
saw
the
skirmish
happen
i
was
gonna
lend
a
hand
but
i
noticed
you
grew
a
few
extra
ones
go
home
xander
buffy
i'm
serious
so
am
i
something's
up
you're
acting
like
a
crazy
person
take
this
for
instance
you
don't
wanna
deal
so
you
hide
it's
not
very
slayerlike
just
leave
me
alone
xander
you
have
no
idea
what's
going
on
no
good
so
you
and
riley
aren't
imploding
it
doesn't
take
a
genius
what
i
can't
figure
out
is
how
you
never
saw
it
coming
what
who
told
you
nobody
told
me
anything
buffy
it
was
right
in
front
of
my
xander
face
the
guy
would
do
anything
for
you
the
guy
got
himself
bit
by
a
vampire
he
lied
to
me
he
ran
around
behind
my
back
and
almost
got
himself
killed
and
now
he
tells
me
that
he's
leaving
with
some
covert
military
operation
at
midnight
unless
i
convince
him
not
to
now
tell
me
that
you
understand
because
i
sure
as
hell
don't
you
gonna
let
him
go
it's
not
my
decision
to
make
of
course
it
is
well
it's
not
fair
who
cares
if
it's
fair
in
about
twenty
minutes
riley's
gonna
disappear
maybe
forever
unless
you
do
something
to
stop
him
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
beg
him
to
stay
why
wouldn't
you
to
keep
riley
here
buffy
i
don't
even
know
who
he
is
anymore
i
mean
i
thought
he
was
dependable
dependable
what
is
he
state
farm
you
know
what
i
mean
yeah
i
think
you
mean
convenient
i
think
you
took
it
for
granted
that
he
was
gonna
show
up
when
you
wanted
him
to
and
take
off
when
you
didn't
look
who's
talking
look
who
has
anya
following
him
around
like
a
lovesick
puppy
oh
boy
is
this
not
about
me
is
she
more
than
a
convenience
'cause
that
would
kinda
be
a
surprise
if
you
don't
wanna
hear
what
i
have
to
say
i'll
shut
up
right
now
good
'cause
i
don't
i
lied
see
what
i
think
you
got
burned
with
angel
then
riley
shows
up
i
know
the
story
xander
but
you
miss
the
point
you
shut
down
buffy
and
you've
been
treating
riley
like
the
rebound
guy
when
he's
the
one
that
comes
along
once
in
a
lifetime
he's
never
held
back
with
you
he's
risked
everything
and
you're
about
to
let
him
fly
because
you
don't
like
ultimatums
if
he's
not
the
guy
if
what
he
needs
from
you
just
isn't
there
let
him
go
break
his
heart
and
make
it
a
clean
break
but
if
you
really
think
you
can
love
this
guy
i'm
talking
scary
messy
noemotionsbarred
need
if
you're
ready
for
that
then
think
about
what
you're
about
to
lose
xander
run
riley
riley
riley
riley
i've
gotta
say
something
'cause
i
don't
think
i've
made
it
clear
i'm
in
love
with
you
powerfully
painfully
in
love
the
things
you
do
the
way
you
think
the
way
you
move
i
get
excited
every
time
i'm
about
to
see
you
you
make
me
feel
like
i've
never
felt
before
in
my
life
like
a
man
i
just
thought
you
might
wanna
know
joss
