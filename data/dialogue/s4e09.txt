hey
thanks
riley
looks
good
oh
hey
buffy
is
there
something
you
want
to
tell
me
what
oh
yes
—
i
am
a
lesbian
well
it's
good
that
you're
so
open
about
it
oh
hey
you
know
how
we
were
talking
about
having
a
picnic
i
was
thinkin'
—
do
you
ever
hang
out
at
rhode's
field
it's
beautiful
there
usually
not
that
crowded
either
i
thought
maybe
we
could
have
a
little
spread
—
sandwiches
maybe
some
ants
it'll
be
fun
we
were
talking
about
having
a
picnic
so
was
that
a
conversation
i
actually
had
or
one
i
was
just
practicing
practicing
okay
yes
—
i
have
been
known
to
do
a
little
prep
work
before
our
conversations
it's
not
easy
you
know
talking
to
you
sometimes
it's
like
an
oral
exam
boy
that's
just
what
every
girl
longs
to
hear
well
you're
tricky
like
an
exam
i
never
know
how
you're
going
to
react
to
something
that's
why
i
like
you
so
much
you're
a
mystery
probably
every
beautiful
girl
in
the
world
has
some
jerk
telling
her
she's
a
mystery
but
i
swear
you
really
are
there's
a
lot
about
you
that
needs
puzzling
out
i
loose
you
somewhere
right
around
beautiful
hey
—
don't
you
just
love
a
picnic
it's
just
different
you
know
a
picnic
first
of
all
daylight
—
kind
of
a
new
venue
buffywise
and
the
best
part
—
he
said
he
would
bring
all
the
food
so
all
i
have
to
do
was
to
show
up
and
eat
those
are
two
things
i'm
really
good
at
so
he's
nice
very
very
and
there's
sparkage
yeah
he's—
have
you
seen
his
arms
those
are
good
arms
to
have
i
really
like
him
i
do
but
i
don't
know
i
really
like
being
around
him
you
know
and
i
think
he
cares
about
me
but
i
just
feel
like
something's
missing
he's
not
making
you
miserable
exactly
riley
seems
so
solid
like
he
wouldn't
cause
me
heartache
get
out
get
out
while
there's
still
time
i
know
i
have
to
get
away
from
that
bad
boy
thing
there's
no
good
there
seeing
angel
in
la
even
for
five
minutes
hello
to
the
pain
the
pain
is
not
a
friend
but
i
can't
help
thinking
—
isn't
that
where
the
fire
comes
from
can
a
nice
safe
relationship
be
that
intense
i
know
it's
nuts
but
part
of
me
believes
that
real
love
and
passion
have
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
pain
and
fighting
i
wonder
where
i
get
that
from
soyou
saw
their
faces
but
you
can't
describe
them
well
they
were
human
two
eyes
each
kind
of
in
the
middle
uh
huh
and
the
lab
underground
i
came
out
through
an
air
vent
i
don't
know
exactly
where
i'm
done
put
the
telly
on
it's
about
time
hope
you
got
it
warm
enough
i
don't
know
why
you're
so
dainty
all
of
a
sudden
you've
done
this
for
angel
—
you
must
have
hey
give
it
okay
that's
it
the
invalid
amnesiac
routine
is
over
the
kitchen
is
closed
until
you
can
tell
me
something
useful
about
the
commandos
i'm
tryin'
to
remember
it
was
very
traumatic
how
long
are
you
going
to
pull
this
crap
how
long
am
i
going
to
live
once
i
tell
you
look
look
spike
—
we
have
no
intention
of
killing
a
harmless
uh
creature
but
we
have
to
know
what's
been
done
to
you
we
can't
let
you
go
until
we're
sure
that
you're
impotent
—
hey
sorry
poor
choice
of
words
until
we're
sure
you're
you're
flaccid
you
are
one
step
away
missy
giles
help
he's
going
to
scold
me
you
know
what
i
don't
think
you
want
us
to
let
you
go
maybe
we
made
it
a
little
too
comfy
in
here
for
ya
comfy
i'm
chained
in
a
bathtub
drinkin'
pig's
blood
from
a
novelty
mug
doesn't
rank
huge
in
the
zagut's
guide
you
want
something
nicer
a
look
at
my
poor
neck
all
bare
and
tender
and
exposed
all
that
blood
just
pumping
away
oh
please
giles
make
her
stop
if
those
two
don't
kill
each
other
i
might
lend
a
hand
what
about
a
truth
spell
i'm
not
positive
it
would
work
on
a
vampire
but
we
could
try
make
him
fess
up
a
truth
spell
of
course
why
didn't
i
think
of
that
‘cause
you
had
your
hands
full
with
the
undead
english
patient
yes
we'll
have
a
go
looks
pretty
simple
i'll
stop
by
the
magick
shop
tomorrow
excellent
alright
i'll
be
back
in
the
morning
with
donuts
and
motherwort
bye
buffy
i'll
see
you
at
home
bye
great
thank
you
willow
um
willow
may
have
had
a
very
helpful
idea
she
seems
to
be
coping
better
with
oz's
departure
don't
you
think
she
still
has
a
way
to
go
but
yeah
—
i
think
she's
dealing
what
are
you
people
blind
she's
hangin'
on
by
a
thread
any
ninny
can
see
that
devon
said
that
he
sent
for
his
stuff
i
guess
that
means
he's
planning
on
settling
down
somewhere
else
not
here
i
guess
so
i
feel
like
i've
been
split
down
the
center
and
half
of
me
is
lost
i
know
it
feels
like
that
now
oz
is
gone
come
on
now
it's
telly
time
this
is
buffy
and
willow
we're
not
in
right
now
so
please
leave
a
message
oh
uh
willow
it's
giles
um
i
thought
you
were
bringing
the
ingredients
for
that
spell
i
really
have
to—
passions
is
on
timmy's
down
the
bloody
well
and
if
you
make
me
miss
it
i'll—
you'll
do
what
lick
me
to
death
look
uh
willow
i
think
we
ought
to
try
the
spell
among
other
things
i'd
like
to
shower
sometime
today
alone
driving
yeah
you
seriously
drive
for
fun
well
not
fourwheeling
or
anything
but

more
my
specialty
i'm
an
avid
pedestrian
you're
kidding
right
i
mean
you
know
how
to
drive
well
i
took
the
class
cars
and
buffy
are
like
unmixy
things
it's
just
because
you
haven't
had
a
good
experience
yet
you
can
have
the
best
time
in
a
car
it's
not
about
getting
somewhere
you
have
to
take
your
time
forget
about
everything
just
relax
let
it
wash
over
you
the
air
motion
just
let
it
roll
we
are
talking
about
driving
right
thought
i
was
i'm
taking
you
some
night

it's
warm
up
past
the
vineyards

going
to
change

that
yeah
yeah
geez

for
his
stuff
and
didn't
even

pretty
harsh

my
powers

liquify
his
entrails
for
her
that's
sweet
god
poor

shimmy
it
off

like
a
good
policy

in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
we're
all

such
aa
strong
word

guttural
anglosaxon

drowning
of

sorrows
not

just
how
it
is
you
have
to
go
through
the
pain
well
isn't
there
someway
i
can
just
make
it
go
away
just
‘cause
i
say
so
can't
i
just
make
it
go
'poof'
harken
all
ye
elements
i
summon
thee
now
control
the
outside
control
within
land
and
sea
fire
and
wind
out
of
my
passions
a
web
be
spun
from
this
eve
forth
my
will
be
done
so
mote
it
be
it
is
my
will
that
my
heart
be
healed
now
i
will
that
this
book
speak
it's
words
to
me
i
will
that
this
qtip
gets
unbendy
come
in
giles
what
are
you
doing
here
i'm
a
bit
concerned
about
you
actually
did
buffy
tell
you
about
the
beer
'cause
uh
buffy
didn't
tell
me
anything
oh
well
forget
the
beer
part
then
happily
i
came
because
we
had
an
appointment
the
other
day
oh
right
right
the
truth
spell
yes
um
willow
i
know
that
you're
going
through
a
very
difficult
time
but
shirking
your
responsibilities—
but
i
didn't
—
shirk
i
did
the
research
and
i
picked
up
the
motherwort
i
just
forgot
the
doing
the
spell
part
well
that
isn't
like
you
at
all
i
know
ii've
been
off
ii
even
tried
to
do
a
spell
last
night
to
have
my
will
done
i
was
hoping
it
would
make
me
feel
better
but
it
just
went
kablooey
a
spell
i
don't
think
it's
wise
for
you
to
be
doing
that
alone
right
now
your
energy's
too
unfocused
well
that's
not
true
i
said
i
was
off
not
incompetent
i
only
meant
that
you're
grieving
and
it
might
be
wise
if
you
took
a
break
from
doing
spells
without
supervision
so
i
get
punished
‘cause
i'm
in
pain
it's
not
punishment
i'm
only
saying
this
because
i—
oh
you
care
yeah
everybody
cares
nobody
wants
to
be
inconvenienced
you
all
want
me
to
take
the
time
and
go
through
the
pain
as
long
as
you
don't
have
to
hear
about
it
anymore
no
that's
not
fair
isn't
it
‘cause
i'm
doing
the
best
i
can
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
enough
for
you
guys
and
i
see
how
you
could
feel
that
way
i
do—
no
you
don't
you
say
that
you
do
but
you
don't
see
anything
um
oh
sorry
um
sorry
pperhaps
i'd
better
be
going
let's
um
let's
talk
about
this
later
oh
i'm
sorry
so
sorry
elobe
enemy
be
now
quiet
you
know
not
too
keen
about
this
spell
stuff
tends
to
be
a
bit
unpredictable
yes
well
you
might
have
thought
about
that
sooner
um
let
your
deceitful
tongue
be
be
uh
let
no
untruths
be
spoken
hey
what's
that
all
about
hm
oh
nothing
i
just
got
ash
in
my
eye
well
i
won't
have
you
doin'
mojo
on
me
if
you
can't
read
properly
you
might
turn
me
into
a
stink
beetle
or
what
all
t'would
be
a
generous
ending
for
you
spike
i
mean
i'm
going
through
something
i
just
don't
see
why
he
was
getting
down
on
me
giles
just
worries
spells
can
be
dangerous
it
doesn't
mean
he
thinks
you're
a
bad
witch
i
am
a
bad
witch
no
you're
a
good
witch
i'm
not
kidding
anyone
if
i
had
any
real
power
i
could
have
made
oz
stay
with
me
will
you
wouldn't
have
wanted
him
to
have
stayed—
and
i
didn't
have
the
guts
to
do
the
spell
on
veruca
and
my
i
will
it
so
spell
went
nowhere
the
only
real
witch
here
is
fuzzy
little
amy
i
think
you're
being
a
too
hard
on
yourself
she's
got
access
to
powers
i
can't
even
invoke
i
mean
first
—
she's
a
perfectly
normal
girl
then
poof
—
she's
a
rat
i
could
never
do
something
like
that
hello
uhh
i'll
be
right
there
spike
escaped
aand
you're
going
now
sorry
—
duty
thing
well
i
mean
what's
the
rush
spike
can't
hurt
anyone
right
and
i
figured
since
i'm
kinda
grievey
we
could
uhyou
know
have
a
girl's
night
we
could
eat
sundaes
and
watch
steel
magnolias
and
you
can
tell
me
how
at
least
i
don't
have
diabetes
will
i
can't
hang
out
with
you
until
i
get
spike
back
to
giles
you
know
that
okay
i'll
be
back
as
soon
as
i
can
i
promise
i
don't
see
the
big
he's
probably
just
standing
out
there
you
could
find
him
in
two
seconds
thought
that
was
gonna
take
longer
me
too
musta
got
turned
around
hang
hang
on
this—
this
is
it
wait
no
yes
what
are
you
talking
about
the
lab
commando
lab
the
door
was
right
here
where
i
escaped
i
don't
think
so
open
up
i'm
gonna
kill
you
spike
there's
nothing
there
let
me
in
fix
me
okay
drop
the
act
get
off
okay
that's
it—
i'm
gonna
gag
you
hey
watch
it
one
more
word
out
of
you
and
i
swear
swear
what
you're
not
gonna
do
anything
to
me
you
don't
got
the
stones
oh
i
got
the
stones
i
got
a
whole
bunch
of
stones
yeah
you're
all
talk
giles
i
accidentally
killed
spike
that's
okay
right
uhuhum
just
a
minute
i
mean
i'm
going
through
something
you'd
think
every
once
in
a
while
buffy
would
make
best
friends
a
priority
you
know
will
it's
not
like
she
could
just
let
spike
go
i
get
this
spell
reversed
they'll
be
finding
your
body
for
weeks
oh
make
a
move
—
please
i'm
dying
for
a
good
slay
spike's
more
important
than
me
i
get
it
buffy's
gotta
find
out
what's
up
with
those
commandos
right
now
she
needs
spike
well
fine
why
doesn't
so
just
go
marry
him
if
the
two
of
you
could
remain
civil
long
enough
to—
it's
just
so
sudden
i
don't
know
what
to
say
just
say
yes
and
make
me
the
happiest
man
on
earth
oh
spike
of
course
it's
yes
giles
you'll
never
believe
what's
happened
it's
just
not
fair
willow
i
know
it's
hard
to
see
it
right
now
but
everything
you're
feeling
is
because
of
you
and
oz
not
because
of
buffy
and
me
or
anybody
but
eventually
you'll
meet
somebody
else
and
it'll
be
better
yeah
‘cause
most
relationships
are
great
and
troublefree
i
don't
think
so
i
think
we're
all
doomed
to
badness
we're
not
doomed
oh
yeah
let'slet's
look
at
your
bio
insect
lady
mummy
girl
anya
you're
a
demon
magnet
i
was
just
trying
to
help
willow
it'sit's
me
something's
happened
i
need
your
help
i
can't
see
very
well
everything's
blurred
i'm
certain
it's
a
spell
of
some
kind
because
wellit
seems
something
else
is
going
wrong
here
you
go
986
horribly
wrong
there's
so

with
the
big
pile
of
dust
under
the
trees
indirect
sunlight
only
warm
breeze

the
leaves
aside
and
again
—
you're
registering

my
father's

bit
of
time

will
but
you

weren't
crazy
about

the
photographer
angel

have
liked
hey
you
think
i
don't
live
with
the
shadow
of
drusilla
over
my
head
that
i'm
not
wondering
if
you're
going
to
be
thinking
of
her
on
our
honeymoon
when
you're
making
sweet
love
to
me
she
walks
to
spike
and
sits
in
his
lap
they

reaches
for
his
glass
of
scotch
knocking
it
to
the
floor

gonna
be
spike'll
even
take
care
of
you
while
i'm
at
the
magick
shop
from
now
on
we're
a
family
that's
alright
i
have
more
scotch
cut
to
buffy
exiting
the
magick
shop
she
stops
in
the
middle
of
the
street
staring
at
a
window
display
of
a
beautiful
wedding
gown
she
walks
over
to
it
memorized
in
the
background
we
see
riley
walking
by
he
sees
her
and
walks
up
hey
buffy
what's
up
riley
look
—
aren't
they
beautiful
um
yeah
they're
nice
a
little
dressy
maybe
for
school
but
riley
buffy
i
really
like
you
i
hope
you
know
that
you
mean
a
lot
to
me
and
if
things
were
different—
different
than
what
i
want
you
to
promise
me
that
we
can
always
be
friends

i'd
really
like
you

day
when

wedding
the
wedding

wedding
my
wedding
i'm
getting

you
believe
it
i
don't
think
no
is
a
strong
enough
word
i
know
it's
crazy
i
mean
we
fought
for
all
these
years
and
then
sometimes
you
just
look
at
someone
and
you
know
you
know
no
i
think
maybe
we
fought
because
we
couldn't
admit
how
we
really
felt
about
each
other
can
we
start
again
you'll
really
like
him
well
nobody
really
likes
him
i
just
need
to
clear
a
few
things
up
i
don't
even
really
like
him
buffy
but
i
love
him
i
do
who
what
what's
his
name
who
the
groom
spike
that's
a
name
don't
be
mad
i'm
not
mad
no
you
are
mad
no
i
am
er
i
really
wow
who
is
this
guy
does
he
go
here
spike
oh
no
he's
totally
old
old
well
not
as
old
as
my
last
boyfriend
was
okay
it's
late
and
i'm
i'm
very
tired
now
so
i'm
just
gonna
go
far
away
and
be
away
but—
no
stay
you're
ruining
my
happy
day
that's
okay
mom
—
we
don't
need
anymore
snacks
i
liked
those
fruit
rollups
shush
i
thought
she'd
never
clear
out
besides
just
think
of
my
lips
as
the
fruit
rollups
of
love
okay
that
was
gross
i'm
a
little
distracted
willow
was
really
upset
i
shouldn't
have
let
her
go
away
mad
regaining
focus
we
just
got
rid
of
your
mom
let's
not
bring
willow
into
this
it's
time
for
just
the
two
of
us
no
no
it's
a
pargo
demon
drowning
it's
the
only
way
to
kill
it
what
the
hell
is
going
on
duh
dum
dada
duh
dum
dada
duh
dum
da
da
dum
da
da
dum
da
da
so
the
plan
is
to
cure
my
total
incapacitating
blindness
tomorrow
they
were
all
out
of
tagas
root
at
the
magick
shop
they'll
have
more
tomorrow
i'm
completely
on
top
of
it
aren't
they
a
perfect
little
us
i
don't
like
him
he's
insipid
clearly
human
oo
red
paint
we
could
smear
a
little
on
his
mouth
—
blood
of
the
innocent
that's
my
girl
stop
that
right
now
i
can
hear
the
smacking
honey
we
need
to
talk
about
the
invitations
now
do
you
wanna
be
william
the
bloody
or
just
spike
‘cause
either
way
it's
gonna
look
majorly
weird
whereas
the
name
buffy
gives
it
that
touch
of
classic
elegance
what's
wrong
with
buffy
huh
such
a
good
question
well
it's
a
terrible
name
my
mother
gave
me
that
name
your
mother
yeah
she's
a
genius
don't
you
start
in
on
my
mother
board
up
the
windows
and
barricade
the
doors
what's
going
on
demons
they
keep
coming
and
coming
i
think
we
lost
them
but
i
couldn't
see
spike
he's
all
untied
which
you
probably
noticed
xander
calm
down
okay
if
you
lost
them
that'll
give
us
some
time
to
figure
this
out
maybe
the
demons
have
something
to
do
with
giles
being
blind
giles
is
blind
please
stop
whatever
you're
doing
you
smell
like
fruit
rollups
this
is
the
crack
team
that
foils
my
every
plan
i
am
deeply
shamed
spike's
right
we
really
should
get
organized
why
are
you
holding
hands
they
have
to
hear
it
sooner
or
later
spike
and
i
are
getting
married
how
what
how
three
excellent
questions
what
are
you
lookin'
at
the
man
i
love
can
i
be
blind
too
wait
married
i
know
something
what
is
it
everything's
so
familiar
work
brain
—
work
oh
oh
oh
willow
mmwhat
about
will
mmm
honey
get
off
something
about
willow
and
her
griefypoorme
mood
swings
—
so
so
tired
of
it
you
mean
i
don't
have
to
be
nice
about
her
anymore
well
we're
all
tired
of
it
but
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
what's
going
on
she
told
me
i
was
a
demon
magnet
aand
you
two
should
get
married
and
that
i
didn't
see
anything
she
did
a
spell
yes
to
have
her
will
done
whatever
she
says
is
coming
true
and
you
both
were
effected
i
probably
only
escaped
because
i'm
the
slayer
some
kind
of
natural
immunity
yeah
right
you're
marrying
spike
because
you're
so
right
for
each
other
xander
that's
it
—
you're
off
the
usher
list
people
willow
is
out
there
and
she
probably
doesn't
know
what
she's
doing
we
gotta
find
her
before
somebody
gets
really
hurt
why
does
he
have
to
come
xander
spike

going
to
be
my
husband
