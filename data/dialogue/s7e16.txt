oh
hello
there
gentle
viewers
you
caught
me
catching
up
on
an
old
favorite
it's
wonderful
to
get
lost
in
a
story
isn't
it
adventure
and
heroics
and
discovery—don't
they
just
take
you
away
come
with
me
now
if
you
will
gentle
viewers
join
me
on
a
new
voyage
of
the
mind
a
little
tale
i
like
to
call
buffy
slayer
of
the
vampyrs
it
was
cold
last
night
and
the
wind
was
crewell
but
the
slayer
had
a
job
to
do
unfortunately
vampires
have
a
job
to
do
too
ouch
my
goodness
things
look
bad
for
the
slayer
don't
they
she
didn't
see
that
second
vampire
concealed
by
cover
of
darkness
ready—
ready
to
attack
and
make
her
his
own
vampirical
spawn
let's
rejoin
them
now
to
see—
for
god's
sakes
andrew
you've
been
in
here
for
30
minutes
what
are
you
doing
entertaining
and
educating
why
can't
you
just
masturbate
like
the
rest
of
us
that
was
great
i
completely
got
you
dusting
that
guy
on
film
hey
why
do
vampires
show
up
on
video
i
told
you
i
didn't
want
you
doing
that
it's
distracting
ok
i'll
cut
the
footage
together
and
do
the
intro
tomorrow
she
was
a
woman
in
danger
or
was
she
are
you
still
filming
me
stop
but
it's
a
valuable
record
an
important
document
for
the
ages
a
slayer
in
action
a
nerd
in
pain
would
they
like
that
'cause
we
could
do
that
but
the
story
needs
to
be
told
birds
need
to
fly
and
girls
need
to
use
the
toilet
and
why
were
you
video
taping
yourself
anyway
sounds
like
kinky
business
to
me
the
world's
gonna
want
to
know
about
buffy
it's
a
story
of
ultimate
triumph
tainted
with
the
bitterness
for
what's
been
lost
in
the
struggle
it's
a
legacy
for
future
generations
if
there
are
any
buffy
seems
to
think
that
this
apocalypse
is
going
to
actually
be
you
know
apocalyptic
i
think
your—your
story
seems
pretty
pointless
oh
i
was
gonna
interview
you
later
today
'cause
you
know
your
whole
perspective
on
the
whole
thing
give
it
editorial
balance
and
uh
glamour
oh
well
balance
is
important
people
don't
always
take
that
into
account
i
could
bring
that
to
you
absolutely
let's
explore
the
world
of
our
story
shall
we
this—uh
buffy
lives
in
sunnydale
california
um
this
is
the
local
high
school
there's
a
hellmouth—hellmouth—underneath
the
high
school
see
weird
things
happen
on
the
hellmouth
that
attracts
all
sorts
of
uh
bad
people
and
demons
and
vampires
and
now
there's
this
thing
in
the
basement
of
the
high
school
called
thethe
seal
of
danzal—danzalthar
and
it's
sort
of
a
door
to
the
hellmouth
uh
due
to
some
circumstances
it
got
opened
up
a
little
bit
recentlyuh
and
this
uh
nasty
nasty
vampire
thing
came
out
of
it
it
was
uh
it
was
just
awful
awful
this
whole
thing—
whole
thing—is
being
orchestrated
by
something
called
the
first
it's
made
up
of
all
the
evil
in
the
whole
world
oh
there's
also
these
guys
they
work
for
the
first
we
don't
know
much
about
them
except
that
they're
very
ugly
and
they're
very
mobile
for
blind
people
is
that
all
clear
it's
morning
in
sunnydale—
who
the
hell's
got
the
lowfat
milk
it's
morning
in
sunnydale
and
the
women
of
command
central
take
the
time
to
fortify
themselves
for
the
day
ahead
hey
women
and
xander
hey
i'm
gonna
do
your
special
intro
later
the
man
who
is
the
heart
of
the
slayer
machine
yeah
the
heart
things
are
tense
in
command
central
this
morning
buffy
is
clearly
concerned
with
some
unknown
danger
and
the
air
is
filled
with
foreboding
oh
um
we're
out
of
raisin
bran
i'll
put
it
on
the
list
that's
probably
not
the
unknown
danger
look
at
this
place
damn
girls'
dorm
is
what
it
is
that's
nice
secondhand
stinkiness
full
house
i
think
it's
a
good
time
to
do
some
introductions
don't
you
gentle
viewers
i'm
amanda
and
i
grew
up
right
here—
not
you
sweetheart
let's
start
from
the
top
you've
already
met
buffy
she's
beautiful
with
a
lion's
heart
and—
and
the
face
of
an
angel
she's
never
afraid
'cause
she
knows
her
side
will
always
win
buffy
and
spike
have
some
kind
of
history—you
can
feel
the
heat
between
them
although
technically
as
a
vampire
he's
room
temperature
anya
a
feisty
waif
with
a
firey
temper
and
a
vulnerable
heart
that
she
hides
even
from
herself
this
lovely
girl—i
don't
remember
her
name—
oh
for
god's
sake
is
he
doing
that
again
can't
we
make
him
stop
i
don't
know
if
we
save
the
world
it
will
be
kind
of
nice
to
have
a
record
of
it
if
we
don't
save
the
world
then
nothing
matters
that's
catchy
amanda
let's
make
that
our
slogan
yeah
it
is
kinda
strange
how
you
keep
saving
the
world
and
there's
not
any
proof
yeah
you
know
for
future
generations
and
it
does
help
the
girls
with
training—you
know
viewing
the
tapes
come
on
no
one
else
thinks
this
is
idiotic
or
is
it
important
i
mean
buff
i
don't
get
why
this
is
bothering
you
so
much
because
it's
a
waste
of
time
come
on
someone
has
to
agree
with
me
spike
long
as
you're
not
pointing
that
thing
at
me
seems
like
a
fine
way
to
keep
the
boy
busy
this
isn't
about
keeping
busy
this
is
about
war
i'm
sorry
to
jump
all
over
you
guys
but
i
have
to
tell
you
what's
really
going
on
there's
something
new
amanda
dawn—you're
gonna
stay
home
from
school
today
we
can
survive
what's
coming
but
not
like
this
i
had
a
vision
of
what's
to
come—a
horrible
vision
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
honestly
gentle
viewers
these
motivating
speeches
of
hers
tend
to
get
a
little
long
i'll
take
you
back
in
there
in—in
a
little
while
but
in
the
inbetween
time
i
thought
you
might
want
to
know
a
little
about
me
your
humble
host
you
see
i
am
a
man
with
a
burden
a
man
with
a
dark
past
you
see
i
was
once
a
super
villain
thus
the
validity
of
the
bronsteddebyehuckel
equation
at
low
ionic
strength
has
been
amply
tested
and
the
charges
on
the
reactant
ions
are
wellknown
if
their
reagents
are
properly
characterized
it
smells
funny
know
kinda
sweaty
what'll
it
do
to
buffy
make
her
super
magnetic
wow
she
won't
be
able
to
get
out
of
her
car
and
knives
and
other
sharp
things
will
fly
at
her
we
could
walk
right
by
her
and
she
wouldn't
be
able
to
stop
us
unless
we
were
wearing
metal
belt
buckles
then
we
would
stick
to
her
in
my
plan
we
are
beltless
wow
you're
the
best
andrew
yep
and
goodlooking
and
smart
too
yeah
wow
warren
was
cool
and
wasn't
jonathan
just
the
cutest
thing
well
shall
we
see
if
buffy's
still
talking
i
mean
mentally
and
from
what
i've
seen
so
far
there's
is
no
way
your
girls
are
ready
you
have
to
she's
not
done
even
willow
looks
bored
and
she
usually
can
take
a
lot
of
that
stuff
look
at
her
ooh
ooh
do
you
see
that
thatthat's
important
willow
and
kennedy
have
been
in
kind
of
a
bad
place
lately
but
things
are
looking
up
you
see
kennedy
pursued
the
reluctant
willow
and
won
her
heart
only
to
find
herself
frightened
when
she
glimpsed
the
darkness
that
still
lies
within
the
witch's
mind
side
note—i
once
had
my
own
personal
encounter
with
dark
willow
jonathan
andrew
you
boys
like
magic
don't
you
abracadabra
yee
haltem
ok
didn't
see
that
coming
that's
because
we
have
power
you
can't
imagine
we
do
you
dark
willow
wield
a
force
of
mighty
evil
it's
true
but
you
are
new
to
the
game
little
one
you
know
what
they
say
if
at
first
you
don't
succeed
holy
cats
here
it
comes
again
i
deflect
thy
power
damn
that
is
one
effective
counter
spell
thank
you
little
one
thank
you
she
was
something
indeed
she
was
hey
i
think
buffy
stopped
talking
that
usually
means
she
had
to
go
to
work
let's
see
what
the
little
locusts
left
for
breakfast
shall
we
not
late
not
late
'til
the
bell
rings
hey
hey
break
it
up
get
to
class
uhoh
hey
shy
girl
don't
do
this
oh
you
knew
i
was
there
yeah
you
noticed
me
it's
ok
i
promise
it
may
seem
ba—
whwhwhat's
wrong
the
mirror
said
i
was
fat
it
said
it
i'm
so—i
can't
take
this
semester
anymore
it's
just
so
much
for
me
to
handle
so
not
only
does
mr
hildebrand
move
up
the
trig
exam
to
today
but
he
also
makes
it
cover
three
more
chapters
and
i've
got
an
english
paper
due
tomorrow
i
feel
like
i'm
gonna
explode
hey
uh
i
can
help
you
just
need
to
relax
you
know
you
know
um
maybe
one
of
you
guys
could
give
him
a
foot
rub
what
something
bad
is
going
on
oh
is
that
right
ooh
you're
hurt
what
happened
someone
threw
a
rock
at
me
as
i
got
out
of
my
car
i
didn't
really
get
a
good
chance
to
see
who
yeah
well
it
could
have
been
any
of
them
students
teachers—something
is
going
on
today
yes
well
um
that
occurred
to
me
as
i
ducked
the
other
two
rocks
buffy
what
the
hell
is
this
everything
slowly
i
may
be
concussed
here
there
this
thing
that
happens
here
in
this
school
over
the
hell
mouth
where
the
way
a
thing
feels—it
kind
of
starts
being
that
wayfor
real
i've
seen
all
these
things
beforejust
not
all
at
once
so
what
it's
like
hell's
a
bustin'
out
all
over
exactly
so
what's
the
worst
that
can
happen
war
pretty
much
oh
i
see
you're
being
amusing
now
with
comical
exaggeration
being
in
high
school
can
feel
like
being
at
war
now
it's
true
the
students
feel
like
the
teachers
are
out
to
get
them
the
chess
club
resents
the
french
club
for
taking
the
activities
room
and
well
everybody
hates
the
cheerleaders
if
we
don't
do
something
about
this
we're
gonna
have
a
riot
on
our
hands
and
a
lot
of
other
nasty
stuff
too
like
what
really
should
have
had
that
foot
rub
dawn
is
a
typical
american
teenager
bubbly
and
sweet
with
a
hunger
for
fun
and
a
smile
that
lights
up
the
room
hello
dawn
used
to
be
a
key
i
don't
really
know
what
that
means
hey
here's
something
i
think
you're
going
to
be
interested
in
gentle
viewers
look
at
the
fine
work
xander
did
on
that
replacing
that
window
sash
you
can't
even
tell
it's
new
it
blends
in
so
well
he's
extraordinary
you've
dealt
with
this
before
i
mean
you've
seen
stuff
like
this
in
a
high
school
sure
you
know
swim
team
monsters
or
killer
prom
dogs
again
not
all
at
once
so
what
makes
now
so
special
my
guess—it's
that
seal
thing
in
the
basement
it's
like
all
the
hellmouth's
energy
is
trying
to
escape
in
that
one
little
spot
and
it's
getting
all—
focusy
careful
you're
starting
to
speak
like
me
now
this
is
xander
and
anya
interview
number
1
for
buffy
a
slayer
of
the
vampyrs
that's
what
you're
calling
it
either
that
or
buffy
the
slayer
who
knew
no
fear
i
like
that
one
thank
you
xander
that's
sweet
of
you
i
understand
that
exactly
one
year
ago
today
you
left
anya
at
the
altar
any
comment
on
that
whoa
what
the
hell
i
just
think
people
will
be
interested
i
know
i
am
what
do
you
have
to
say
for
yourself
one
year
later
i've
apologized
enough
that's
what
i
have
to
say
but
you
think
it
was
something
that
called
for
an
apology
well
yes
so
you
don't
think
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
of
course
he
doesn't
think
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
what
interesting
i
think
we're
getting
something
here
look
anya
if
i
had
married
you
it
would
have
been
against
everything
i
thought
was
best
it
wouldn't
have
worked
but
we—we
still
spark
i
mean
i
get
jealous
of
you
you
get
jealous
of
me
you
still
love
me
is
that
true
xander
do
you
still
love
her
i
swear
we
just
covered
this
thing
up
it
doesn't
want
to
stay
hidden
anymore
it
wants
to
turn
these
kids
into
monsters
and
victims
and
who
knows
what
it's
more
than
that
look
robin
i
um
i
had
a
vision
the
other
day
you
have
visions
sometimes
oh
well
how
do
you
know
that
they're
not
just
dreams
you're
running
to
catch
the
bus
naked
that's
a
dream
army
of
vicious
vampire
creatures
that's
a
vision
also
i
was
awake
a
bus
to
where
i
mean
an
army
of
how
many
hundreds
maybe
hundreds
of
hundreds
all
i
know
is
the
last
ubervamp
i
faced
crawled
out
of
that
very
hole
it
makes
me
awfully
nervous
what
are
you
doing
now
have
you
ever
really
studied
it
you
know
gotten
close
well
i
know
it's
a
goat
with
its
tongue
out
uh
willow
did
a
search
on
the
symbolic
database
but
it
turns
out
everybody
loves
a
good
goat's
tongue
rock
groups
covens
and
greek
cookbooks
she
said
she
couldn't
narrow
it
down
and
you
trust
her
yes
why
wouldn't
i
trust
her
i
don't
know
why
any
of
you
should
trust
each
other
you've
all
been
evil
at
some
point
right
no
that's
not
true
yeah
willow
had
a
bad
patch
but
i've
never
been
evil
is
what
evil
does
and
i
know
what
you're
doing
you're
with
that
vampire
screwing
that
vampire
you
filthy
whore
robin
are
you
ok
whoa
what
happened
i—i
think
it
was
controlling
you
buffy
we've
got
to
get
rid
of
this
seal
we've
got
to
shut
it
down
before
it
starts
affecting
everyone
i
think
i
have
a
pretty
good
idea
who
we
should
talk
to
yeah
who's
that
the
guy
that
fed
it
it's
first
drop
of
blood
god
i
hope
that's
not
a
student
i
thought
i
told
you
to
piss
off
with
this
bloody
camera
yet
here
you
are
again
with
that
thing
in
my
face
would
you
sod
off
before
i
rip
your
throat
out
and
eat—
ok
spike
the
light
was
kind
of
behind
you
oh
right
uh
what
is
this
better
then
i
thought
i
told
you
to
piss
off
with
this
bloody
camera
yet
here
you
are
again
with
that
thing
in
my
face
would
you
sod
off—
you
keep
dodging
the
question
i
don't
mean
to
it's
just—you
know
how
i
feel
right
and
you
were
the
one
who
didn't
want
to
keep
seeing
each
other
and
here's
where
we
hop
on
the
merrygoround
of
rotating
knives
i
blame
you
and
you
blame
me
and
we
both
end
up
all
cut
to
shreds
please
just
tell—
do
you
still
love
me
yes
i
still
love
you
i
always
will
i
just
don't
know
if
that
means
anything
for
us
anymore
well
i
love
you
too
i
don't
know
if
that
means
anything
either
well
it's
nice
to
hear
i'm
not
gonna
find
anyone
out
there
like
you
am
i
doesn't
seem
likely
i
guess
i'm
more
replaceable
obviously
no
there's
no
one

up

danger

hands

no
weapons

were
ready
to
protect

your
life

heads
up
andrew

got
to
talk
we
just
spent
the
day
keeping
a
lid
on
a
war
ooh
that
would
be
very
exciting
on
tape
the
school
is
out
of
control
with
energy
from
the
hellmouth
it's
time
for
you

let's
try
looking
it
up
again
in
the
morning
in
the
dictionario
holy
cats
that
was
terrifying
we're
fugitives
haunted
by
our
past
tormented
by
a
message
we
don't
understand
we're
hunted
men
driven
mad
by
forces
beyond
our
understanding
we're
men
of
hidden
power
tortured
from
within
byby
a
voice
from
out
of
nowhere
i
don't
deserve
this
i
wasn't
even
that
evil
i
thought
you
were
evil
yeah
sure
i
respected
your
ideas
for
evil
projects
and
i
thought
you
had
good
followthrough
oh
well
thanks
it's
nice
that
you
noticed
ok
i
think
we're
getting
a
little
off
track
here
i
don't
want
to
do
this
anymore
everyone's
staring
at
me
just
focus
on
the
charm
you
have
to
focus
on
the
charm
to
pull
the
memories
out
tell
us
about
the
seal
but
it
tickles
and
i'm
all
tense
can't
i
have
a
cool
refreshing
zima

zima
shut
your
face
about
the
zima

the
first
one
to
uncover
the
seal
and
feed
it
blood
how
did
you
know
it
was
there
how
did
you
know
what
to
do
ii

look
at
the
charm
but
i—i'm
not

a
detached
journalist

with
a
neutral
eye

going
to
smash
this
camera

a
wild
desperate
thing

of
weird
weapons

good
friend
to
me
here
in
mehico
he
said
he'll
buy
me
a
burro
oh
you
can
stab
him
it's
all
part
of
the
plan
that
boy's
blood
is
a
powerful
tribute
it's
a—it's
a
gift
to
something
very
big
very
important
and
ultimately
won't
even
hurt
him
we
get
a
reward
you
and
me
and
him
too
we
live
as
gods
that's
right
man
the
trio
living
as
gods
we
are
gods
oh
we
are
gods
we
are
as
gods
we
are
as
gods
there's
power
in
that
knife
drive
the
words
deep
into
him
it's
the
only
way
for
us
to
get
our
reward
got
it
if
i
kill
him
with
this
knife
we
live
as
gods
wait
a
second
go
back
what
was
that
part
again
you
mean
this
part
we
are
as
gods
not
that
part
we
need
to
see
that
knife
there's
something
there
kennedy
search
his
stuff
find
the
knife
it's
not
in
my
stuff
it's
in
the
kitchen
in
the
cutlery
drawer
you
didn't
have
any
steak
knives
you
put
your
old
murder
weapon
in
with
our
utensils
i
washed
it
what
are
you
looking
for
he
said
the
first
said
something
about
words
drive
the
words
deep
into
him
there
was
some
carving
on
the
blade
i
just
thought
it
was
a
pattern
found
it
ok
you're
mr
demonsummoner
how
are
you
with
demon
languages
whoa
you
were
right
it's
in
tawarick
it's
uh
like
prototawarick
it's
really
really
old
but
what's
the
big
we
never
knew
anything
about
this
seal
now
we
know
this
knife
and
this
language
are
connected
to
it
somehow
andrew
do
you
speak
tawarick
yeah
i'm
ok
with
it
it
says
the
blood
which
i
spill
i
consecrate
to
the
oldest
evil
creepy
will
what're
you
thinking
you
think
you
can
do
something

a
shot
guess
what
andy
you
just
won
yourself
a
free
vacation
to
the
beautiful
downtown
hellmouth
so

what
yell
at
it
in
its
own
language
maybe
what
i—i'm
not
following
look
we
have
to
deal
with
the
seal
right
away
we
already
might
have
to
just
shut
the
school
down
and
i'm
not
losing
any
more
territory
to
the
first
besides
it's
the
only
thing
we've
got
the
seal
responds
to
this
language
somehow
oror
the
first
wouldn't
have
needed
this
knife
andrew
knows
the
language
can
really
talk
to
it
maybe
give
it
commands
robin

a
biographer
especially
a
murderer
yeah
well

keep
tossing
that
word
around
but
that's
not

what
happened
what
you
stabbed
jonathan
to
death
what
were
you
trying
to
do
scratch
his
back
from
the
front
it
was
confusing
jonathan
and
i
were
digging
but
warren
was
there
and
only
i
could
see
him—
not
one
of
them
cares
about
you
but
i
care
about
them
that's
why
i'm
here
do
it
stab
him
no
i
can't
do
it
what
do
it
now
this
isn't
right
stab
him
spill
the
blood
who
are
you
talking
to
what
isn't
right
what's
wrong
with
you
are
you
a
little
coward
no
but
did
you
actually
think
i
could
use
this
that
good
a
knife
just
do
it
it'll
feel
good
what's
going
on
he's
making
me
do
it
you
tricked
me
damn
you
i'll
kill
you
first
i'll
kill
you
stab
him
you
have
to
if
you
fail
you'll
die
a
lost
soul
and
i'll
hate
you
forever
no
see
i'm
a
man
trapped
by
circumstances
into
paying
for
a
crime
i
didn't
even—
what
no
i
just
thought
you
would
say
that
i
saw
the
seal
possess
wood
like
that
earlier
today
yes
yes
see
that's
why
i'm
here
die
die
die
what
have
i
done
get
out
of
my
brain
aaaah
you
just
completely
changed
your
entire
story
did
not
uh
ya
did
too
did—uh
hey
here
we
are
there's
someone
in
there
no
we're
going
in
just
be
prepared
ok
the
seal
could
have
done
anything
to
them
go
nope
they're
ok
wow
wow
wow
that
was
nice
certainly
was
you
carpenter
you
it's
too
bad
buffy
took
spike's
chains
down
huh
you
said
it
mmm
i
feel
good
well
yeah
i'm
a
spitfire
in
the
bedroom
yeah
i
knew
we'd
always
do
that
again
yeah
one
more
time
anyway
is
that
what
that
was
one
more
time
do
you
think
there
should
be
more
i
don't
know
it
was
nice
it
felt
um—it
felt
like
a
one
more
time
i
think
maybe
we're
really
over
which
is—it's
good
right
i
mean
now
we
can
move
on
sure
wonder
what's
keeping
'em
i
thought
they'd
be
up
here
by
now
how'd
they
make
this
in
here
you
suppose
wood
shop
i
guess
it's
nice
to
know
they're
paying
attention
in
class
she's
like
a
woman
fighting
for
more
than
life
she
fights
like
fighting
is
her
life
it's
like
the
air
she
breathes
and
she
knows
she
will
win
because
there
is
no
alternative
it's
your
turn
andrew
so
you
figure
what
i
uh
i
stand
on
the
seal
and
hold
the
knife
and
command
it
to
stop
glowing
in
tawarick
or
we
could
do
this
what
doesn't
really
make
sense
does
it
bringing
you
here
to
talk
to
it
this
thing
doesn't
understand
words
it
understands
blood
blood
opens
it
you
don't
want
to
open
it
opening
it
would
be
bad
yeah
willow
did
a
little
research
turns
out
the
blood
of
the
person
that
awoke
it—you—different
kind
of
deal
it
reverses
the
whole
thing
so
how
much
bloodare
you
gonna—
i
don't
know
maybe
not
enough
to
kill
you
so
this
is
my
redemption
at
last
i
buy
back
my
bruised
soul
with
the
blood
of
my
heart
butbut
not
enough
to
kill—
stop
stop
telling
stories
life
isn't
a
story
sorry
sorry
shut
up
you
always
do
this
you
make
everything
into
a
story
so
no
one's
responsible
for
anything
because
they're
just
following
a
script
please
don't
kill
me
warren
said
jonathan
would
be
ok
i
trusted
him
and
i
lost
my
friend
you
didn't
lose
him
you
murdered
him
i
know
but
you
don't
need
to
kill
me
you
said
we
could
all
get
through
this
i
made
it
up
i'm
making
it
all
up
what
kind
of
hero
does
that
make
me
no
you're
doing
great
really
kudos
yeah
well
i
don't
like
having
to
give
a
bunch
of
speeches
about
how
we're
all
gonna
live
because
we
won't
this
isn't
some
story
where
good
triumphs
because
good
triumphs
good
people
are
going
to
die
girls
maybe
me
probably
you
probably
right
now
don't
please
don't
please
when
your
blood
pours
out
it
might
save
the
world
what
do
you
think
about
that
does
it
buy
it
all
back
are
you
redeemed
no
why
not
because
i
killed
him
because
i
listened
to
warren
and
i
pretended
i
thought
it
was
him
but
i
knew—i
knew
it
wasn't
and
i
killed
jonathan
and
now
you're
gonna
kill
me
and
i'm
scared
and
i'm
going
to
die
and
this—this
is
what
jonathan
felt
it
stopped
didn't
want
blood
it
wanted
tears
thanks
sorry
i
had
to—
you—you
weren't
really
going
to
stab
me
were
you
i
wasn't
going
to
stab
you
what
if
the
tears
didn't
work
she
got
it
done
always
has
so
far
here's
the
thing
i
killed
my
best
friend
there's
a
big
fight
coming
and
i
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
i
don't
even
think
i'm
going
to
live
through
it
that's
uh
probably
the
way
it
should
be
i
guess
i'm—
