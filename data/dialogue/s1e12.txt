you
know
how
i
feel
about
you
it's
uh
pretty
obvious
isn't
it
there's
never
been
anyone
else
for
me
but
you

we're
good
friends
and
it's
time
to
take
the
next
step

terrible
right

buffy
spring
fling

isn't
any
dance
it's
a
time
for

observe
their
mating
rituals
and
tag
them
before
they
migrate
just
kill
me
you're
doing
fine
why's
it
so
hard
i
should
just
walk
up
to
her

say
'hey

go
to
the
dance

usual
what

glad

a
science

that's
a
good
start
buffy
i
like
you
a
lot
and
i
know
we're
friends
and
we've
had
experiences
we've
fought
some
bloodsucking
fiends
and
that's
all
been
a
good
time
but
i
want
more
i
wanna
dance
with
you
xander
you're
one
of
my
best
friends
you
and
willow
well
willow's
not
looking
to

you
or
if

pretty
close
to
the
chest
i
don't
want
to
spoil
the
friendship
that
we
have
well
i
don't
want
to
spoil
it
either
but

you
don't
i
don't
xander

you
that
way
well
try

wait
xander

gotta
be
undead
to

time
with
you
that's
really
harsh
look
i'm
sorry
i
don't
handle

know
what
it
is
what
do
you
know
well
i
have
been
surfing
the
'net
looking
for
unexplained
incidents
you
know
people
are
always
sending
stuff
my
way
they
know
the
occult's
my
turf
now
here
is
the
latest
a
cat
last
week
gave
birth
to
a
litter
of
snakes
a
family
was
swimming
in
whisper
lake
when
the
lake
suddenly
began
to
boil
and
mercy

born
with
his
eyes
facing
inward
i'm
not
stupid
this
is
apocalypse
stuff
and
throw
in
last
night's
earthquake

i'd
say

a
problem

would
say
the
end
is
pretty
seriously
nigh
i
don't
know
if
i
can
trust
you
i
helped
you
cast
that
demon
out

some
trust

got
this
this
crazy
monk
emailing
me
from
cortona

this
monk
uh
a

luca
something
keeps
sending
out
global
mailings
about
a
prophecy
i
need
you

talk
to
him
find

everything
he
knows

need
a
favor
what

the
bronze

hey
hey
how'd
it
go
on
a
scale
of
one
to
ten
it
sucked
oh
well
i
guess
it
could
be
worse
i
could
have
gangrene
on
my
face
well
what'd
she
say
apart
from
'no'
does
it
really
matter
she's
still
jonesin'
for
angel
and
could
care
less
about
me
at
least
now
you

right
the
deal's
done
the
polls
are
in

you
think
i
wanna
go
to
the
dance
with
you
and
watch
you
wish
you
were
at
the
dance
with
her
you
think
that's
my
idea
of
hijinks
you

know
better
i
didn't
think
i'm
sorry
it
didn't
work
out
for
you
i'll
see
you
on
monday
that's
okay
i
don't
wanna
go
i'm
just
gonna
go
home
lie
down
and
listen
to
country
music
the
music
of
pain
giles
you
are
not
gonna
believe
this
it's
clear
it's
what's
gonna
happen
uh
it's
happening
now
angel
it
can't
be
you've
gotta
be
wrong
i've
checked
it
against
all
my
other
volumes
it's
very
real
well
there's
gotta
be
some
way
around
it
listen
some
prophecies
are
are
a
bit
dodgy
they're
they're
mutable
buffy
herself
has
has
thwarted
them
time
and
time
again
but
this
is
the
codex
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
does
not
come
to
pass
then
you're
reading
it
wrong
i
wish
to
god
i
were
but
it's
very
plain
tomorrow
night
buffy
will
face
the
master
and
she
will
die
well
have
you
verified
the
text
so
that's
it
huh
i
remember
the
drill
one
slayer
dies
next
one's
called
wonder
who
she
is
will
you
train
her
or
will
they
send
someone
else
buffy
i
they
say
how
he's
gonna
kill
me
do
you
think
it'll
hurt
don't
touch
me
were
you
even
gonna
tell
me
i
was
hoping
that
i
wouldn't
have
to
that
there
was
some
way
around
it
i
i've
got
a
way
around
it
i
quit
it's
not
that
simple
i'm
making
it
that
simple
i
quit
i
resign
ii'm
fired
you
can
find
someone
else
to
stop
the
master
from
taking
over
i'm
not
sure
that
anyone
else
can
all
the
the
signs
indicate
the
signs
read
me
the
signs
tell
me
my
fortune
you're
so
useful
sitting
here
with
all
your
books
you're
really
a
lotta
help
no
i
don't
suppose
i
am
i
know
this
is
hard
what
do
you
know
about
this
you're
never
gonna
die
you
think
i
want
anything
to
happen
to
you
do
you
think
i
could
stand
it
we
just
gotta
figure
out
a
way
i
already
did
i
quit
remember
pay
attention
buffy
if
the
master
rises
i
don't
care
i
don't
care
giles
i'm
sixteen
years
old
i
don't
wanna
die
i
fall
to
pieces
each
time
i
see
you
again
i
never
knew
what
enough
was
hi
honey
you
alright
until
i'd
had
more
than
my
share
buffy
sure
probably
just
full
from
that
bite
of
dinner
you
nearly
had
i
let
the
darkness
in
feel
like
telling
me
what's
on
your
mind
and
it
was
then
i
lost
the
dare
mom
let's
go
away
what
anywhere
just
for
a
while
all
weekend
honey
i
no
it'll
be
great
you
and
me
a
motherdaughter
thing
we
can
talk
about
all
the
embarrassing
things
you
love
to
bring
up
you
know
the
gallery's
open
on
weekends
mom
please
isn't
the
prom
tomorrow
night
or
spring
fling
whatever
they're
calling
it
ii
guess
nobody
asked
you
oh
someone
but
not
the
right
someone
see
sometimes
i
actually
do
know
what
you're
thinking
well
then
uh
this
probably
isn't
the
best
time
for
this
but
uh
i
saw
you
eyeing
it
at
the
store
i
figured
mom
we
can't
afford
this
the
way
you've
been
eating
we
can
afford
it
it's
beautiful
i
think
you
should
wear
it
to
the
dance
no
ii
can't
go
to
the
dance
says
who
is
it
written
somewhere
you
should
do
what
you
want
homecoming
my
freshman
year
of
college
i
didn't
have
a
date
so
i
got
dressed
up
and
i
went
anyway
was
it
awful
it
was
awful
for
about
an
hour
then
what
happened
i
met
your
father
he
didn't
have
a
date
either
he
did
and
that's
a
much
funnier
story
that
you
will
not
get
to
hear
oh
but
it
was
a
beautiful
night
and
you
had
your
whole
life
ahead
of
you
yeah
must
be
nice
oh
kevin
said
that
he'd
bring
everything
to
the
bronze
last
night
he
promised
we'll
never
get
everything
ready
in
time
he
probably
forgot
it's
not
that
big
a
deal
uh
you
don't
understand
i'm
not
mad
he
totally
flaked
on
me
on
me
and
i
don't
even
care
god
help
me
i
think
it's
cute
oh
there
they
are
they're
watching
cartoons
that's
so
cu
that's
not
cute
that's
annoying
i'm
annoyed
right
i'm
furious
men
i
don't
know
why
we
put
up
with
them
i
hear
ya
obviously
kevin
has
underestimated
the
power
of
my
icy
stare
oh
my
god
kevin
no
kevin
buffy
there's
something
on
the
news
willow
i've
seen
so
much
i
thought
i
could
take
anything
but
buffy
this
this
was
different
it'll
be
alright
i'm
trying
to
think
how
to
say
it
to
explain
it
so
you
understand
it
doesn't
matter
as
long
as
you're
okay
i'm
not
okay
i
knew
those
guys
i
go
to
that
room
every
day
and
when
i
walked
in
there
it
it
wasn't
our
world
anymore
they
made
it
theirs
and
they
had
fun
what
are
we
gonna
do
what
we
have
to
promise
me
you'll
stay
in
tonight
okay
buffy
i
like
your
dress
take
care
soon
soon
okay
so
this
master
guy
tried
to
open
the
hellmouth
but
he
got
stuck
in
it
and
now
all
the
signs
are
reading
that
he's
gonna
get
out
which
opens
the
hellmouth
which
brings
the
demons
which
ends
the
world
yes
that
about
sums
it
up
yes
the
part
that
gets
me
though
is
where
buffy
is
the
vampire
slayer
she's
so
little
you
know
how
to
get
in
touch
with
this
uh
brother
luca
chap
hmm
as
far
as
i
can
tell
no
one
can
he's
disappeared
what
did
it
say
isaiah
116
which
i
dutifully
looked
up
'the
wolf
shall
live
with
the
lamb
the
leopard
shall
lie
down
with
the
kid
the
calf
the
lion
and
the
fatling
together
and
the
little
child
to
lead
them'
ms
calendar
that's
kinda
warm
and
fuzzy
for
a
message
of
doom
well
that
depends
where
he's
leading
them
to
aurelius
wrote
of
the
anointed
one
'the
slayer
will
not
know
him
and
he
will
lead
her
into
hell'
ms
calendar
so
luca
thinks
the
anointed
is
a
kid
if
the
vampire
that
buffy
killed
was
in
fact
not
the
anointed
then
it
may
well
be
well
then
we
need
to
warn
her
i
don't
intend
involving
her
at
all
what
do
you
mean
buffy's
not
gonna
face
the
master
i
am
no
you're
not
so
i'm
looking
for
a
kid
huh
and
he'll
lead
me
to
the
master
buffy
i'm
not
gonna
send
you
out
there
to
die
now
you
were
right
ii've
waded
around
in
these
old
books
for
so
long
i've
forgotten
what
the
real
world
is
like
iit's
time
i
found
out
you're
still
not
going
up
against
the
master
i've
made
up
my
mind
so
have
i
i
made
up
my
mine
first
i'm
older
and
wiser
than
you
and
just
just
do
what
you're
told
for
once
alright
that's
not
how
it
goes
i'm
the
slayer
i
don't
care
what
the
books
say
i
defy
prophecy

club

the
master

hellmouth

even
breathe
if

lucky
how
can
i
say
this
clearly
i
don't
like
you
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
pretty
much
think
you're
a
vampire
but
buffy's
got
this
big
old
yen
for
you
she
thinks
you're
a
real
person
and
right
now
i
need
you
to
prove
her
right
you're
in
love
with
her
aren't
you
the
master
is
as
old
as
any
vampire
on
record
there's
no
telling
how
powerful
he'll
be
if
he
reaches
the
surface
okay
here's
my
question
the
hellmouth
opens
yes
where
if
he's
underground
and
it's
right
where
he
is
where's
it
gonna
open
good
point
uh
well

have
a
look
through
the
black
chronicles
okay
uh
willow
willow
huh
could
you
look
through
the
local
histories
please
check
for
any
common
denominators
uh
locations
of
incidences
and
such
right
okay
welcome
thanks
for
having
me
y'know
you
really
oughtta
talk
to
your
contractor
looks
like
you
got
some
water
damage
oh
good
the
feeble
banter
portion
of
the
fight
why
don't
we
just
cut
to
the
nice
shot
this
way
what
you
were
looking
at
my
neck
what
you
were
checking
out
my
neck
i
saw
that
no
i
wasn't
just
keep
your
distance
pal
i
wasn't
looking
at
your
neck

told
you
to
eat
before
we
left
you're
not
going
to
kill
me
with
that
thing
don't
be
so

don't
understand
your
part
in
all
this
do
you
you
are
not
the
hunter
you
are
the
lamb
well
let's
think
about
this
then
the
vampires
have
been
gathering
they
know
he's
coming
they
will
be
his
army
do
you
think
they'll
gather
at
the
hellmouth
well
the
last
time
the
master
tried
to
rise
was
the
harvest
he
sent
a
bunch
of
vampires
to
get
him
fresh
blood
well
where
did
that
go
down
the
bronze
