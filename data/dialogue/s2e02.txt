of
us

a
ton
of
trig
homework
waiting
hey
is
this
a
bad
time
are
you
crazy
you
don't
just
sneak
up
on
people
in
a
graveyard
you
make
noise
when
you
walk
you
stomp
or
yodel
i
heard
you
were
on
the
hunt
i'm
supposed
to
be
but
lazy
bones
here
doesn't
wanna
come
out
and
play
when
you
first
wake
up
it's
a
little
disorienting
he'll
show
it's
weird
to
think
of
you
going
through
that
it's
weird
to
go
through
so
uh
you're
here
alone
yeah
why
i
just
thought
you'd
have
somebody
with
you
xander
or
someone
xander
or
someone
nope
why
are
you
jealous
of
xander
please
he's
just
a
kid
is
it
'cause
i
danced
with
him
'danced
with'
is
a
pretty
loose
term
'mated
with'
might
be
a
little
closer
don't
you
think
you're
being
a
little
unfair
it
was
one
little
dance
which
i
only
did
to
make
you
crazy
by
the
way
behold
my
success
i
am
not
jealous
you're
not
jealous
what
vampires
don't
get
jealous
see
whenever
we
fight
you
always
bring
up
the
vampire
thing
well
i
didn't
come
here
to
fight
oh
right
i
did
where's
my
stake
ii
know
i
had
a
stake
i
didn't
see
a
stake
what
do
you
mean
he's
just
a
kid
does
that
mean
i'm
just
a
kid
too
look
obviously
i
made
a
mistake
coming
here
tonight
oh
no
you
don't
you
can't
just
turn
and
walk
away
from
me
like
that
it
takes
more
than
that
to
get
rid
of
me
oof
uhhh
you
okay
i'm
fine
gee
i
wish
people
wouldn't
leave
open
graves
lying
around
like
this
so
another
vampire
has
risen
tonight
i
don't
think
so
look
at
those
tracks
whoever
was
buried
here
didn't
rise
from
this
grave
she
was
dragged
from
it
wwwwhat
i'm
proposing
is
um
and
ii
don't
mean
to
appear
indecorous
is
is
um
a
aaa
social
engagement
um
a
a
a
aa
date
if
you're
amenable
you
idiot
boy
i
guess
we
never
realized
how
much
you
like
that
chair
iii
was
just
working
on
your
pickup
lines
um
in
a
manner
of
speaking
yes
then
if
you
wouldn't
mind
a
little
gene
and
roger
you
might
wanna
leave
off
the
'idiot'
part
being
called
an
idiot
tends
to
take
people
out
of
the
dating
mood
hmm
it
actually
kinda
turns
me
on
i
fear
you
you
also
might
wanna
avoid
words
like
'amenable'
and
'indecorous'
y'know
speak
english
not
whatever
they
speak
in
um
england
yeah
you
just
say
'hey
i
got
a
thing
you
maybe
have
a
thing
maybe
we
could
have
a
thing'
giles
oh
thank
you
cyrano
i'm
not
finished
then
you
say
'how
do
you
feel
about
mexican'
giles
about
mexicans
mexican
food
you
take
her
for
food
for
which
you
then
pay
oh
right
so
this
chairwoman
we
are
talking
ms
calendar
right
wwhat
makes
you
think
that
simple
deduction
ms
calendar
is
reasonably
dollsome
especially
for
someone
in
your
age
bracket
she
already
knows
that
you're
a
school
librarian
so
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
how
to
break
that
embarrassing
news
to
her
and
she's
the
only
woman
we've
actually
ever
seen
speak
to
you
add
it
all
up
and
it
all
spells
'duh'
now
is
it
time
to
have
a
talk
about
the
facts
of
life
you
know
i'm
suddenly
deciding
this
is
none
of
your
business
y'know
because
that
whole
stork
thing
is
a
smoke
screen
so
um
how
did
things
go
last
night
did
mr
korshak
show
up
on
schedule
more
or
less
angel
and
i
took
care
of
him
angel
there's
something
else
though
we
found
an
empty
grave
another
vampire
no
no
this
one
was
dug
up
and
the
body
was
taken
out
grave
robbing
that's
new
interesting
i
know
you
meant
to
say
gross
and
disturbing
yes
yes
yes
of
course
uh
terrible
thing
must
must
put
a
stop
to
it
damn
it
so
why
does
someone
want
to
dig
up
graves
well
i'll
uh
collect
some
theories
uh
it
would
help
if
we
knew
who
the
body
belonged
to
meredith
todd
ring
a
bell
no
she
died
recently
she
was
our
age
drawin'
a
blank
why
don't
we
ask
willow
to
uh
fire
this
thing
up
and
uh
track
meredith
down
smile
hey
oh
look
at
those
legs
no
thank
you
eric
will
you
knock
it
off
hey
chris
hey
oh
i
i
was
just
wondering
what
you
were
gonna
do
this
year
why
'cause
every
year
you
win
and
i
place
second
so
i
just
thought
i'd
see
what
i'm
up
against
you
know
what
the
key
is
if
dr
clark
doesn't
understand
your
experiment
he
gives
you
higher
marks
so
it
looks
like
he
understands
your
experiment
'the
effects
of
subviolet
light
spectrum
deprivation
on
the
development
of
fruit
flies'
that
should
do
the
trick
okay
i'm
doing
this
under
protest
it
is
not
fair
that
they're
making
participation
in
this
year's
science
fair
mandatory
i
don't
think
anyone
should
have
to
do
anything
educational
in
school
if
they
don't
want
to
'the
tomato
fruit
or
vegetable'
i
wanted
to
do
something
i
could
finish
in
a
weekend
alright
stop
it
what
are
you
doing
we
are
under
florescent
light
for
god's
sake
the
camera
loves
you
i
didn't
think
yearbook
nerds
came
out
of
hibernation
till
spring
it's
for
my
private
collection
eric
will
you
quit
it
comin'
through
sorry
uh
sorry
to
interrupt
willow
but
it's
the
bat
signal
okay
sure
see
you
later
chris
thanks
for
the
tip
okay
uhhh
cordelia's
so
fine
y'know
she'd
be
just
perfect
for
us
don't
be
an
idiot
she's
alive
this
shouldn't
take
long
i'm
probably
the
only
girl
in
school
who
has
the
coroner's
office
bookmarked
as
a
favorite
place
hi
sorry
to
interrupt
your
little
undead
playgroup
but
i
need
to
ask
willow
if
she'll
help
me
with
my
science
fair
project
it's
a
fruit
i
would've
asked
chris
to
help
me
but
then
that
would've
brought
back
too
many
memories
of
daryl
i
found
it
meredith
todd
died
in
a
car
accident
last
week
of
course
i
have
learned
to
deal
with
my
pain
how
was
her
neck
fine
except
for
being
broken
hello
can
we
deal
with
my
pain
please
there
there
it
says
that
meredith
and
two
other
girls
in
the
car
were
killed
instantly
they
were
all
on
the
fondren
high
pep
squad
on
the
way
to
a
game
you
know
what
this
means
that
fondren
might
actually
beat
sunnydale
in
the
crosstown
body
count
competition
this
year
she
wasn't
killed
by
vampires
somebody
did
dig
up
her
corpse
eww
why
is
it
that
every
conversation
you
people
have
has
the
word
'corpse'
in
it
okay
so
we
got
a
body
snatcher
what
does
that
mean
uh
hhere's
what
i've
come
up
with
demons
who
eat
the
flesh
of
the
dead
to
absorb
their
souls
or
iiit
could
obviously
be
a
a
voodoo
practitioner
you
mean
making
a
zombie
uh
zombies
more
likely
for
most
traditional
purposes
a
voodoo
priest
would
require
more
than
one
so
we
should
see
if
the
other
girls
from
the
accident
are
awol
too
maybe
we
can
figure
out
what
this
creep
has
in
mind
if
we
know
whether
or
not
he's
dealing
in
volume
so
we
dig
up
some
graves
tonight
oh
boy
a
field
trip
are
you
gonna
call
angel
i
don't
think
so
yeah
why
bother
him
huh
angel
and
i
have
been
um
never
mind
as
far
as
angel's
concerned
i'm
taking
the
night
off
okay
so
we're
set
then
say
nineish
byo
shovel
and
i'll
pack
some
food
who
else
likes
those
little
powdered
doughnuts
me
cordelia
darn
i
have
cheerleader
practice
tonight
boy
i
wish
i
knew
we
were
gonna
be
digging
up
dead
people
sooner
i
would've
canceled
alright
but
if
you
come
across
the
army
of
zombies
can
you
page
us
before
they
eat
your
flesh
xander
huh
zombies
don't
eat
the
flesh
of
the
living
yeah
i
knew
that
but
did
you
see
the
look
on
her
face
i
couldn't
believe
angel
he
was
acting
all
jealous
and
he
wouldn't
even
admit
it
jealous
of
what
of
xander
because
you
did
that
sexy
dance
with
him
am
i
ever
gonna
live
that
down
no
anyway
he
was
being
totally
irrational
love
makes
you
do
the
wacky
that's
the
truth
y'know
this
might
go
a
lot
faster
if
you
femmes
actually
picked
up
a
shovel
too
here
here
sorry
but
i'm
an
oldfashioned
gal
i
was
raised
to
believe
that
men
dig
up
the
corpses
and
the
women
have
the
babies
so
speaking
of
the
wacky
what
was
cordelia's
whole
riff
about
painful
memories
who's
daryl
daryl
epps
chris'
older
brother
he
was
a
big
football
star
allstate
two
years
ago
he
was
a
running
he
was
a
running
uh
someone
who
runs
and
catches
was
he
studly
big
time
all
of
the
girls
were
crazy
for
him
and
he
broke
cordy's
heart
thus
possibly
proving
its
existence
he
died
rock
climbing
or
something
he
fell
man
that's
lousy
poor
chris
ever
since
then
chris
has
been
real
quiet
kind
of
in
his
own
world
i
heard
their
mother
doesn't
even
leave
the
house
anymore
i
think
we're
there
by
the
way
are
we
hoping
to
find
a
body
or
no
body
call
me
an
optimist
but
i'm
hoping
to
find
a
fortune
in
gold
doubloons
um
body
would
mean
flesheating
demon
no
body
would
point
towards
the
uh
army
of
zombies
thing
take
your
pick
really
right
then
uh
go
on
you're
closer
pathetic
much
move
over
guys
if
we
don't
get
this
down
by
tomorrow
no
one's
gonna
be
led
by
our
cheers
practice
okay
see
ya
later
hello
xander
harris
if
this
is
some
kind
of
joke
cordelia
this
is
the
last
place
i
expected
you
to
hang
out
oh
god
god
it's
you
why
were
you
following
me
i
wasn't
sure
it
was
you
at
first
i'm
looking
for
buffy
buffy
well
she's
uh
big
shock
she's
at
the
graveyard
she
said
she'd
be
home
well
she
lied
isn't
she
a
rascal
well
you're
in
luck
it
just
so
happens
that
my
night
is
free
uh
hold
on
my
skirt
is
caught
there
so
both
coffins
are
empty
that
makes
three
girls
signed
up
for
the
army
of
zombies
is
it
an
army
if
you
just
have
three
zombie
drill
team
then
you're
back
angel
xander
angel
i
thought
you
were
takin'
the
night
off
i
i
was
um
but
something
came
up
cordelia
told
me
the
truth
that's
gotta
be
a
first
um
as
long
as
you're
here
perhaps
you
could
be
of
some
help
hmm
hmm
we
were
investigating
somebody's
been
digging
up
the
bodies
of
dead
girls
i
know
we
found
some
of
them
you
mean
like
two
of
the
three
i
mean
like
some
of
them
like
parts
it
was
horrible
angel
saved
me
from
an
arm
god
there
were
so
many
parts
they
were
everywhere
why
are
these
terrible
things
always
happening
to
me
karma
so
much
for
our
zombie
theory
so
much
for
all
our
theories
i
don't
get
it
why
go
to
all
the
trouble
to
dig
up
three
girls
only
to
chop
them
up
and
throw
them
away
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
especially
from
a
time
management
standpoint
well
what
i
saw
didn't
add
up
to
three
whole
girls
i
think
they
kept
some
parts
could
this
get
yuckier
they
probably
kept
the
other
parts
to
eat
question
answered
why
dispose
of
the
remains
five
miles
from
the
cemetery
at
a
school
of
all
places
maybe
because
whoever
did
it
had
some
business
in
the
neighborhood
like
say
classes
oh
ah
this
was
no
hatchet
job
whoever
made
those
incisions
really
knew
what
they
were
doing
yes
really
what
student
here
is
gonna
be
that
well
versed
in
physiology
well
i
can
think
of
five
or
six
guys
in
the
science
club
and
me
so
will
come
clean
promise
to
never
do
it
again
and
we'll
call
it
a
night
he
joked
willow
why
don't
you
get
these
guys'
locker
numbers
so
we
can
do
some
checking
no
i
have
to
go
home
now
i
have
to
take
a
bath
and
burn
my
clothes
you
have
to
go
aw
too
bad
keep
in
touch
buhbye
i
don't
wanna
go
alone
i'm
still
fragile
can
you
take
me
great
i'll
drive
how
about
that
i
always
pegged
him
as
a
onewoman
vampire
i'm
going
out
mom
i'll
be
back
later
okay
mom
daryl
daryl
daryl
daryl
daryl
you
understand
in
my
capacity
as
school
official
this
search
is
completely
unauthorized
and
i
i
cannot
condone
it
fine
your
butt's
covered
wanna
grab
a
locker
uh
yes
yes
of
course
okay
eric
let's
see
what's
on
your
annoying
little
mind
nothing
in
here
but
back
issues
of
scientific
american
ooo
i
haven't
read
this
one
nothing
remarkable
here
guys
your
friend
chris
epps'
locker
'grey's
anatomy'
'mortician's
desk
reference'
'robicheaux's
guide
to
muscles
and
tendons'
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
chris
is
involved
he's
into
corpses
alright
but
we
still
don't
know
why
yes
we
do
i
guess
you'll
say
what
can
make
me
feel
this
way
my
girl
talkin'
'bout
my
girl
my
girl
how's
my
baby
she's
not
your
baby
she's
not
gonna
be
anybody's
baby
if
we
don't
finish
her
soon
i'm
working
on
it
so
am
i
friend
so
am
i
any
sign
of
our
suspects
not
yet
i
don't
get
it
why
would
anybody
wanna
make
a
girl
you
mean
when
there's
so
many
premade
ones
just
lying
around
the
things
we
do
for
love
love
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
maybe
not
but
i'll
tell
you
this
people
don't
fall
in
love
with
what's
right
in
front
of
them
people
want
the
dream
what
they
can't
have
the
more
unattainable
the
more
attractive
and
for
eric
the
unattainable
would
include
everyone
that's
alive
uh
eric's
sick
enough
to
do
something
like
this
but
what
about
chris
he
seems
like
a
human
person
i
dunno
that
thing
with
his
brother
was
really
hard
on
him
and
he
talked
about
death
a
lot
maybe
he
just
wanted
to
get
oneup
on
it
but
it's
not
doable
i
mean
making
someone
from
scraps
actually
making
them
live
if
it
is
my
science
project's
definitely
coming
in
second
this
year
and
speaking
of
love
we
were
talking
about
the
reanimation
of
dead
tissue
do
i
deconstruct
your
segues
hey
oh
yes
hello
still
no
sign
of
our
mad
doctors

oh
uh
corpses

if
it's
important
why
don't
you
just
tell
me
at
the
game
game
oh
uh
you're
going
to
the
football
game
yeah
you
seem
surprised
no
no
iiiiii
just
assumed
that
you
you
you
spent
your
evenings
downloading
incantations
and
and
and
casting
bones
on
game
night
are
you
nuts
you're
going
too
right
oh
of
course
always
always
do
so
we
should
just
go
together
look
i
could
pick
you
up
after
school
and
we'll
grab
a
bite
to
eat
on
the
way
if
you
like
how
do
you
feel
about
mexican
good
okay
and
whatever
it
is
you
wanna
tell
me
you
can
just
tell
me
then
okay
okay
tonight
then
that
went
well
i
think
i
still
don't
get
how
chris
could
do
it
i
mean
arresting
the
cell
deterioration
is
one
thing
but
hello
i
wanna
get
ahead
maybe
an
electrical
current
combined
with
an
adrenaline
boost
for
the
love
of
god
can
somebody
scratch
my
nose
well
it's
official
chris
and
eric
didn't
come
to
school
today
that's
no
coincidence
maybe
they
finished
their
project
god
what
if
it
worked
what
what
if
that
poor
girl
is
walking
around
poor
girls
technically
what
could
she
be
thinking
and
what
are
they
gonna
do
with
her
i
don't
think
we
need
to
worry
about
that
just
yet
i
spoke
to
a
press
person
this
morning
about
the
remains
the
police
have
finished
sorting
through
them
and
apparently
they
found
three
heads
in
the
dumpster
they
only
had
three
girls
precisely
so
they
don't
have
the
whole
uh
package
heads
must
be
no
good
huh
i
found
'em
attractive
enough
well
obviously
i'm
not
as
sick
as
chris
and
eric
based
on
what
the
police
have
put
together
i
would
say
they're
one
step
short
of
completing
their
masterpiece
one
step
we're
running
out
of
time
if
we
wait
too
long
the
onset
of
atrophy
in
the
limbs
will
be
irreversible
we
can
turn
up
the
current
that'll
buy
us
a
day
at
least
we
will
lose
the
entire
body
if
we
don't
attach
a
head
soon
we
have
time
we
don't
the
crash
with
the
girls
was
lucky
but
we
can't
just
keep
waiting
around
for
another
lucky
accident
to
drop
a
head
in
our
laps
you
know
what
we
have
to
do
hell
it's
just
one
lousy
girl
i
won't
do
it
i
i
can't
kill
anyone
please
understand
i
i
can't
do
that
please
don't
make
me
but
you
gave
me
your
word
you
promised
me
little
brother
that
i
wouldn't
be
alone
the
body
is
perfect
and
if
we
harvest
a
head
tonight
she'll
be
ready
by
sunrise
when
you
brought
me
back
you
promised
you'd
take
care
of
me
i
need
this
chris
i
need
someone
please
don't
ask
me
to
do
this
don't
ask
me
to
take
a
life
i
tried
to
tell
him
if
you
take
a
life
in
order
to
make
a
life
the
whole
thing
is
a
wash
no
harm
no
foul
maybe
you
could
you
could
go
out
no
let
people
know
they
can't
see
me
chris
you've
always
been
smarter
than
me
you
were
always
the
brains
you're
the
only
one
who

long
seconds

ha
ha
a
man
of
taste
my
girl
talkin'
'bout
my
girl
my
girl
i
checked
the
obits
nothing
that
would
make
for
a
likely
candidate
they
seem
kinda
picky
for
guys
who
had
three
heads
to
begin
with
formaldehyde
formaldehyde
yes
yes
yes
yes
of
course
it
accelerates
neural
decay
in
the
brain
cells
after
a
couple
days
they're
useless
they're
gonna
need
something
really
fresh
how
fresh
as
fresh
as
possible
buffy
you
don't
think
that
they
would
i
think
anybody
who
cuts
dead
girls

pieces

not
get
the
benefit
of
any
doubt
i
wanna
end
this
thing

all
of
a
sudden
someone
jumped

shh
quiet
down

the
fight
song

cheerleader
pyramid

out
there
yeah
you
don't
understand
i
have
to
go
i'm
the
apex
chris
i
know
what
you're
trying
to
do
you
and
eric
i
know
about
the
bodies
from
the
cemetery
but
you
haven't
hurt
anyone
yet
look
i
know
what
it's
like
to
lose
someone
that
you're
close
to
but
that's
no
excuse
what
you're
doing
is
wrong
i
have
to
do
this
for
him
he
needs
someone
who
eric
he
needs
industrial
strength
therapy
he
always
looked
out
for
me
stood
up
for
me
he's
all
alone
everybody
loved
him
and
now
he's
all
alone
who
are
you
talking
oh
my
god
you
promised
me
you
promised
i
wouldn't
have
to
be
alone
it's
not
too
late
nothing's
changed
we
can
still
do
this
you
and
me
your
brother's
not
the
only
one
who
can
create
life
whadaya
say
let's
go
scare
you
up
a
date
daryl
daryl
daryl
he's
not
here
where
else
could
he
be
but
he
would
never
go
out
uunless
he's
gonna
pick
up
where
you
left
off
go
razorbacks
go
go
team
go
go
razorbacks
go
go
team
go
i
don't
know
what
it
is
about
football
that
does
it
for
me
i
mean
it
lacks
the
the
grace
of
basketball
the
uh
poetry
of
baseball
at
its
best
it's
unadorned
aggression
it's
such
a
rugged
contest
rugged
american
football
and
that's
funny
because
no
i
just
think
it's
rather
odd
that
a
nation
that
prides
itself
on
its
virility
should
feel
compelled
to
strap
on
forty
pounds
of
protective
gear
just
in
order
to
play
rugby
is
this
your
normal
strategy
for
a
first
date
dissing
my
country's
national
pastime
did
you
just
say
'date'
you
noticed
that
huh
hi
ms
calendar
hi
giles
hey
guys
what's
up
eric's
was
a
bust
nothing
there
yeah
nothing
but
a
bunch
of
computer
equipment
and
a
pornography
collection
so
prodigious
it
even
scared
me
did
buffy
get
back
yet
no
uh
no
uh
perhaps
you
should
uh
circulate
nearer
the
field
see
what
you
can
find
so
what's
the
score
i
don't
see
her
do
you
no
please
what's
going
on
just
take
off
the
blindfold
i
promise
i
won't
scream
i
promise
she's
beautiful
no
it's
bad
luck
for
the
groom
to
see
the
bride
before
the
wedding
please
just
take
off
the
blindfold
i
promise
i
won't
scream
i
promise
cordelia
you
can
scream
all
you
want
we're
in
an
abandoned
building

were
always
good
to
me
always
noticed
me
but
i
ignored
you
i'm
sorry
i'm
glad
i
have
a
second
chance
to
tell
you
that
ddaryl
i
was
thoughtless
i
see
that

i've
changed

learned

appreciate
how
much
it
meant
that
you
wanted
to
be
with
me
we're
ready
ready
ready
for
what
you're
gonna
feel
a
little
pinch

worry

you
wake
up

have
the
body

seventeenyearold

rest
of
the
body

the
lab
where
is
that
i
promised
him
that
i
look

kill
cordelia

just
give
and

lives

not
your
job

the
old
science

the

brought
him
back
ii
was
just
tryin'
to
look
out
for
him
like
he
woulda
done
for
me
i
saw
the
fire
i
figured
you'd
be
here
is
everyone
okay
yeah
we're
okay
sorry
about
all
this
it's
okay
although
a
good
rule
of
thumb
for
a
first
date
is
don't
do
anything
so
exciting
that
it'll
be
hard
to
top
on
the
second
date
believe
it
or
not
since
i've
moved
here
to
live
on
top
of
the
hellmouth
the
events
of
this
evening
actually
qualify
as
a
slow
night
did
you
just
say
'second
date'
you
noticed
that
huh
well
i
guess
that
makes
it
official
everybody's
paired
off
vampires
get
dates
hell
even
the
school
librarian
sees
more
action
than
me
you
ever
think
that
the
world
is
a
giant
game
of
musical
chairs
and
the
music's
stopped
and
we're
the
only
ones
who
don't
have
a
chair
all
the
time
xander
i
just
wanted
to
thank
you
for
saving
my
life
what
you
did
in
there
was
really
brave
and
heroic
and
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
if
there
was
anything
that
i
could
ever
do
to
do
you
mind
we're
talking
here
so
where
were
we
wondering
why
we
never
get
dates
yeah
so
why
do
you
think
that
is
god
the
whole
thing
was
so
creepy
well
at
the
same
time
i
mean
he
did
do
it
all
for
his
brother
sounds
like
he
took
it
a
little
over
the
edge
love
makes
you
do
the
wacky
what
crazy
stuff
oh
crazy
like
a
twohundredandfortyoneyearold
being
jealous
of
a
high
school
junior
are
you
fessing
up
i've
thought
about
it
maybe
it
bothers
me
a
little
i
don't
love
xander
yeah
but
he's
in
your
life
he
gets
to
be
there
when
i
can't
take
your
classes
eat
your
meals
hear
your
jokes
and
complaints
he
gets
to
see
you
in
the
sunlight
i
don't
look
that
good
in
direct
light
it'll
be
morning
soon
i
should
probably
go
i
could
walk
you
home
