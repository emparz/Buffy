are
you
guys
crazy
that
was
an
incredible
game
i've
never
cheered
so
hard
in
my
life
i
still
have
knee
marks
on
my
back
from
the
pyramid
i
don't
see
what
this
has
to
do
with
me
ok
what
are
you
talking
about
because
you
are
soooo
creepy
right
now
whatever
can
i
go
i
told
them
not
to
move
you
they
probably
severed
your
spinal
cord
xander
yeah
because
that
never
happens
in
american
high
schools
i
think
i
should
work
with
wesley
oh
please
like
shame
has
something
to
be
proud
of
hi
mr
beech
i
was
just
wondering
were
you
planning
on
killing
a
bunch
of
people
tomorrow
oh
it's
for
the
yearbook
the
newspaper
guy
but
we
can't
figure
out
if
it's
him
without
the
worksheet
right
we
have
no
shot
the
killer
could
be
anyone
we
lose
by
this
time
tomorrow
you'll
all
know
what
i've
done
i'm
sure
you
understand
that
i
had
to
do
it
and
that
although
death
is
never
easy
it's
the
only
way'
god
doesn't
anyone
write
in
to
praise
the
cheerleaders
we
are
so
unsung
