just
wanna
make
sure
you're
you

ok
that
you're
safe
i'm
tracking
you
something's
bothering
you
an
aspect
of
the
demon
by
rumor
that
doesn't
mean
anything
i
mean
sometimes
demons
they
just
exagerate
their
power
hey
i
won't
let
anything
happen
to
you
if
i
can
help
it
no
matter
what
i'll
always
be
with
you
hey
i'll
love
you
even
if
you're
covered
with
slime
you
can't
get
into
my
mind
it's
like
the
mirror
the
thoughts
are
there
but
they
create
no
reflection
in
you
you
got
the
aspect
of
the
demon
you
don't
have
to
play
games
with
me
buffy
ever
so
ask
me
what
do
you
wanna
know
about
faith
how
i
felt
kissing
her
pretending
to
have
no
soul
watching
you
suffer
i
hated
hurting
you
more
than
i
could
stand
kissing
her
meant
nothing
i
don't
want
a
bad
girl
i've
done
that
before
i've
lived
a
long
time
buffy
and
i'm
past
that
i've
been
with
dozens
of
girls
like
her
more
i
mean
there's
no
comparison
in
twohundredfortythree
years
i've
loved
exactly
one
person
next
time
just
ask
and
buffy
be
careful
with
this
gift
a
lot
of
things
that
seem
strong
and
good
and
powerful
they
can
be
painful
exactly
i'm
dying
to
get
rid
of
that
i'm
a
funny
guy

got
it
i'm
gonna
help
you
giles
