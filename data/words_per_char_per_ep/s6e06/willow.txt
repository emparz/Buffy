i'm
just
saying
you
might
wanna
rethink
the
stereotype
before
someone
turns
you
into
a
toad
and
while
you're
at
it
why
don't
you
try
removing
that
broomstick
from
your
dawn
if
i
see
one
more
idiot
that
thinks
witches
are
all
hairy
moles
and
rotted
teeth
oh
look
at
you
you
are
just
the
cutest
thing
i
know
but
look
with
the
hat
and
the
the
wart
oh
let's
go
fill
your
tummy
up
with
sugary
niblets
okay
or
i
could
whip
up
a
jaunty
selfcleaning
incantation
it'll
be
like
fantasia
i
think
i'm
a
little
more
adept
than
a
cartoon
mouse
that

that's

wow
why
wait
why
bother
these
are
perfect
and
extra
biodegradabley
in
a
couple
of
hours
poof
well
you
can
fight
monsters
naturally
with
sticks
and
stones
don't
recommend
it
though
how
which
makes
them
happy
like
pretty
decorations
made
anya
happy
why
are
you
being
like
this
this
is
so
about
you

always
coming
down
on
me
for
for
doing
magic
that
couldn't
harm
a
fly

your
problem

a
hot
mamayama

from
humble
geekinfested
roots

have
to
try
now

look
over
here

take
too
long
one
among
many
many
fade
to
one
i'm
just
gonna
clear
the
crowd
i'll
just
shift
everyone
who
isn't
a
fifteenyearold
girl
into
an
alternate
dimension
no
it'll
be
for
like
a
fraction
of
a
second
they
won't
even
notice
why
well
it
won't
sukut

you
taking
his
side
now
you
two
have
been
talking
about
me
behind
my
back

me
feel
well

be
a
good
start
takulum

monster
mashing

missed
it

what's
tara

i'm
sorry

want
me
to
do
reverse
time
and
take
it
back
