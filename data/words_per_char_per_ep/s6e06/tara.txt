could
use
some
help
in
magical
texts
i'm
not
really
much
for
the
timber

more
fingers
which
is
good
'cause
there's
no
need
to
wear
those
big
white
gloves
to
overcompensate
congratulations

maybe
we'll
even
have
time
to
decorate
for
the
next
one
the
grocery
store's
still
open
we

could've
bought
decorations
there
no
they're
they're
great
it's
just

why
use
magic
when
you
can
do
something
naturally
it's
different
becau
because
you're
protecting
people
keeping
them
from
being
hurt

not
the
point
will

isn't
about
me
