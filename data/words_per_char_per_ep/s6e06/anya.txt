eyeball
get

second
one
free

angel

this
is
a
special
kind
of
angel
called
a
charlie
we
don't
have
wings
we
just
skate
around
with
perfect
hair
fighting
crime
where's
your
costume
but
you
get
to
dress
up
and
play
games
xander's
gonna
teach
me
a
new
one
after
work
called
shiver
me
timbers

play
how
'bout
you
ever
play
shiver
me
timbers
buffy
we're
running
low
on
mandrake
root
check
the
basement
ooh
go
help
giles
that
was
the
most
incredible
thing
i
have
ever
experienced
except
for
that
what
you
all
did
for
me
tonight

the
astounding
heaps
of
money
you
helped
me
us
acquire
all
i
can
say
is
i
hope
we
make
as
much
tomorrow
oh
postholiday
clearance
the
cornerstone
of
retail
every
time
i
close
out
the
cash
register
the
dance
of
capitalist
superiority
now
i

i
thought
you
were
waiting
for
the
right
moment
here
have
some
money
and
he
said
he
couldn't
imagine
the
rest
of
his
life
without
me
and
then
he
gave
me
this
oh
absolutely
not
oh
that's
okay
this
is
just
the
first
premarital
celebration
there'll
be
lots
more
with
gifts
this
is
so
much
better
than
the
way
it
usually
looks
thank
you
yes
please
so
i
was
thinking
maybe
a
june
wedding
but
then
i
remembered
that
they
always
had
the
highest
percentage
of
calls
for
vengeance
so
now
i'm
leaning
towards
as
soon
as
damn
possible
i
mean
mortal
life
being
so
short
we
gotta
get
in
as
much
marital
bliss
as
we
can
before
we
wither
and
die
i
mean
there's
just
so
much
to
consider
though
i
mean
planning
the
wedding
and
and
new
cars
house
and
babies
you
have
to
plan
for
babies
or
they
just
run
roughshod
over
your
entire
existence
ha
ha
ha
yeah
if
we
want
our
progeny
to
eat
paste
and
have
their
lunch
money
stolen
i
know
i
mean
i
am
the
luckiest
exdemon
in
the
world
i
mean
to
be
able
to
find
the
one
person
in
all
dimensions
that
i
was
meant
to
be
with
and
have
everything
work
out
exactly
as
i
dreamed
i
mean
how
often
does
the
universe
allow
that
to
happen
it
gave
me
more
time
to
plan
the
bridal
shower
where
do
we
order
obscenely
muscular
male
strippers
well
i'm
kidding
geez
