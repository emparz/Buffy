looking
for
me
look
who's
home
and
they
say
one
person
can't
make
a
difference
you
mean
guerrero
or
his
wife
oh
very
manly
not
at
all
village
people
so
much
sexier
than
the
outfit
from
his
last
job
we
have
a
counterpoint
ok
now
for
some
of
that
you
were
channeling
your
mother
yeah
i
guess
i
never
really
thought
about
it
that
way
with
mom
at
aunt
darlene's
this
year
i'm
not
getting
a
thanksgiving
maybe
it's
just
as
well
it's
not
really
a
one
of
those
that's
part's
just
ceremonial
imaginary
xander
is
quite
the
machine
huh
hmm
oh
no
i'm
sorry
a
lost
mission
i
mean
a
hairbrush
i
can
understand
and
by
the
way
i
will
find
that
and
get
that
back
to
you
but
how
do
you
lose
a
mission
mostly
i've
just
found
sewers
full
of
demons
mmhmm
postmidterm
frenzy
and
the
holiday
everyone's
going
home
it's
so
not
fair
i
mean
they
all
get
a
family
holiday
just
because
they
can
go
home
to
their
families
you
know
what
i
should
have
my
own
thanksgiving
i
can
cook
the
meal
just
like
my
mom
does
have
all
you
guys
over
it'll
be
great
it
is
a
sham
but
it's
a
sham
with
yams
it's
a
yam
sham
i
know
but
i
want
it
it's
like
professor
walsh
was
saying
about
sense
memory
i
smell
a
roasting
turkey
and
i'm
8
years
old
i
liked
having
that
to
look
forward
to
everything's
different
now
i
mean
we
could
definitely
use
a
little
comfort
food
i
bet
giles
doesn't
have
any
plans
and
xander
always
tries
to
avoid
all
of
his
family
gatherings
i
don't
know
she
and
xander
seem
pretty
tight
lately
look
pilgrims
aside
isn't
that
the
whole
point
of
thanksgiving
everybody
has
a
place
to
go
that's
one
fun
little
hobby
you've
got
there
will
soshe
brutally
stabs
herself
dumped
the
body
then
cut
off
her
own
ear
yeah
wait
something's
missing
from
this
case
early
1800
chumash
knife
there's
a
picture
pretty
darn
scary
it
more
like
a
riot
than
a
ralph's
i
thought
i
was
going
to
have
to
use
slayer
moves
on
this
one
woman
who
was
completely
hoarding
the
pumpkin
pie
filling
oh
right
the
knife
was
some
sort
of
indian
artifact
chumash
i
think
that's
all
we
got
that's
interesting
uhuh
there
was
a
big
ol'
scissors
lying
right
there
that
knife
was
picked
for
a
reason
do
you
even
own
a
turkey
pan
giles
if
you
would
like
to
get
by
in
american
society
then
you
are
going
to
have
to
follow
our
traditions
you're
the
patriarch
you
have
to
host
the
festivities
or
it's
all
meaningless
how
about
that
ceremonial
knife
huh
pretty
juicy
piece
of
clueage
don't
you
think
thank
you
yeah
uh
i
still
need
to
pick
up
a
few
things
so
i'll
check
in
and
keep
your
hands
off
the
food
but
that's
whipped
cream
in
a
canister
look
it's
only
right
if
you
whip
it
yourself
ok
it's
the
last
thing
i
promise
besides
i
have
an
appointment
with
that
priest
that
giles
called
about
he
thinks
he
might
have
some
information
riley
where'd
you
come
from
i
didn't
see
you
at
all
it'll
be
just
like
it
was
when
i
was
a
kid
only
without
me
building
a
fort
out
of
my
mashed
potatoes
it
will
be
um
you
know
if
you
don't
already
have
plans
you
should
come
i'm
a
great
cook
in
theory
i've
eaten
a
lot
iowa
that's
one
of
the
ones
in
the
middle
right
sounds
nice
exactly
if
i
knew
who
that
was
well
have
fun
at
the
homestead
they
have
to
take
you
in
father
gabriel
father
gabriel
father
are
you
out
here
god
you're
very
wrong
about
that
they
tell
you
to
start
an
ear
collection
it's
plenty
uncommon
for
me
to
freeze
up
during
a
fight
i
mean
i
had
the
guy
i
was
ready
for
the
takedown
and
i
stopped
and
native
american
we
don't
say
indian
and
the
thing
is
i
like
my
evil
like
i
like
my
men
evil
you
know
straight
up
black
hat
tied
to
the
train
tracks
soon
my
electroray
will
destroy
metropolis
bad
not
all
mixed
up
with
guilt
and
the
destruction
of
an
indigenous
culture
ok
you
know
what
we
need
to
boil
those
and
put
them
through
the
ricer
you
don't
have
a
ricer
what
do
you
mean
how
could
someone
not
have
a
ricer
i
don't
know
what's
a
ricer
yes
ok
and
i
do
want
to
stop
him
i'd
just
like
to
find
a
nonslayee
way
to
do
it
hey
peas
these
are
frozen
you
said
you
were
going
to
get
fresh
ones
peas
they
come
in
little
pods
you
were
going
to
shell
them
they're
gonna
be
mushy
you're
the
reason
we
had
to
have
pilgrims
in
the
first
place
so
what
happened
to
the
chumash
boy
cultural
partnership
center
really
didn't
stress
any
of
that
stuff
so
hus
wasn't
kidding
about
the
rightful
vengeance
routine
yes
but
after
dinner
right
i
have
to
baste
you
didn't
bring
rolls
i
think
they
do
connect
didn't
you
say
the
chumash
got
all
diseased
when
they
were
all
holed
up
in
the
mission
that's
the
stuffing
that's
sort
of
the
question
before
the
court
this
is
no
good
it
needs
more
condensed
milk
over
bickering
and
confusion
i'll
take
pie
we
will
find
a
solution
and
we
will
have
a
nice
dinner
ok
both
end
of
story
i'm
having
thanksgiving
and
it'll
be
perfect
the
part
where
i
help
you

want
me
to
help
make
it
quicker
what
are
you
saying
so
you
haven't
murdered
anybody
lately
let's
be
best
pals
you
don't
have
any
circulation
get
used
to
it
i
have
more
important
things
to
worry
about
so
tell
me
everything
you
know
then
sit
about
half
a
stick
and
a
quarter
cup
of
brandy
you
do
have
brandy
don't
you
what's
wrong
just
a
small
brandy
the
dean
dean
guerrero
he's
the
king
of
us
and
he
was
at
the
ceremony
will
anything
in
those
books
about
how
to
stop
a
native
american
spirit
guy
some
nice
nonjudgmental
way
to
you
know
kill
him
what
choice
do
we
have
kill
a
lot
of
people
will
you
know
how
bad
i
feel
about
this
it's
eating
me
up
14
cup
of
brandy
and
let
it
simmer
but
even
though
it's
hard
we
have
to
end
this
yes
he's
been
wronged
and
i
personally
would
be
ready
to
apologize
uh
the
preferred
term
well
i
think
the
spaniards
actually
did
a
lot
of
not
that
i
don't
like
spaniards
i
just
wanna
have
thanksgiving
fine
ok
but
someone
still
has
to
go
warn
the
dean
not
alone
sure
you're
up
to
it
yeah
guys
the
dean's
house
is
up
past
the
gym
and
hurry
dinner's
in
an
hour
later
i
hope
the
others
are
ok
i
always
wondered
that
giles
plates
you
can
have
gravy
that
has
blood
in
it
right
do
i
have
to
gag
you
because
i
am
not
gonna
listen
to
you
whine
all
the
way
through
my
dinner
it's
gonna
be
a
nice
quiet
civilized
you
listen
maybe
i
wasn't
clear
before
about
how
terrible
we
all
feel
'cause
we're
trying
to
help
uh
you
can
have
casinos
now
who
was
that
yes
let's
talk
about
it
some
more
where's
your
weapons
chest
ohh
shut
up
spike
how
many
it's
too
many
we
need
help
giles
these
guys
they
don't
die
your
knife
can
kill
you
a
bear
i
didn't
mean
to
oh
it
was
yummy
nobody
asked
you
thanks
wasn't
exactly
a
perfect
thanksgiving
i
guess
that
much
is
true
first
thanksgiving
on
my
own
and
we
all
got
through
it
and
they
say
romance
is
dead
or
maybe
they
just
wish
it
