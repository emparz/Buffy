she
sounds
good
kind
of
intense
about
this
thanksgiving
thing
whatever
killed
the
woman
in
the
museum
that's
probably
the
danger
well
maybe
i'm
wrong
but
i
gotta
try
something
i
can't
just
keep
watching
it's
not
yours
anymore
either
are
you
going
to
walk
away
no
if
she
knew
i
was
here
it
was
distract
her
it
could
get
her
hurt
i
don't
want
to
get
in
the
way
or
maybe
it
was
trapped
there
and
now
it's
released
something
that
has
a
fondness
for
ancient
weapons
you
know
father
gabriel
he
knows
the
history
of
this
place
pretty
well
his
family
dates
back
to
mission
times
he
might
be
able
to
fill
in
some
blanks
to
watch
her
believe
me
i'm
not
getting
the
good
half
of
this
deal
to
be
on
the
outside
looking
in
at
what
i
can't
well
i'd
forgotten
how
bad
it
feels
i'm
not
evil
i'm
here
to
help
buffy
my
friend
had
a
vision
buffy's
in
danger
if
she
sees
me
it'll
be
worse
willow

know
how
i
feel
about
her
if
there
was
any
way

justeverything's
different
now
willow
i'm
here
to
protect
buffy
i
don't

a
whole
lot
of
time
for
personal
stuff
well
if
you
can
just
tell
me
who's
that
guy
willow

everyone
think
that
i
haven't
been
evil

a
long
time

the
chumash
weapons

from
the
cultural
center
