when
i
first
realized
we
were
outgrowing
our
current
cultural
center
i
was
concerned
then
i
realized
it
was
like
seeing
one's
child
grow
up
and
move
on
to
better
things
in
this
case
a
spacious
new
facility
to
be
built
on
this
site
and
that's
why
it's
appropriate
that
the
groundbreaking
for
the
uc
sunnydale
cultural
partnership
center
is
taking
place
so
soon
before
thanksgiving
because
that's
what
the
melting
pot
is
about
contributions
from
all
cultures
making
our
culture
stronger
and
thus
a
symbolic
beginning
it's
a
very
exciting
opportunity
i
can't
wait
to
go
down
there
myself
it's
justwell
it's
means
we're
going
to
have
to
start
looking
for
a
new
location

no
it's
really
up
to
the
dean

i
just
hope
this
doesn't
cost
us
another
year

ok
talk
to
you
later
