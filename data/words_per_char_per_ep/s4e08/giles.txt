and
at
some
point
you
are
going
to
tell
me
about
the
murder
oh
chumash
indians
they
were
indigenous
to
this
whole
area
then
of
course
the
murder
weapon
might
have
just
been
a
convenient
choice
tell
me
again
why
we're
not
doing
this
at
your
house
and
this
is
in
no
way
an
elaborate
scheme
to
stick
me
with
the
cleanup
yes
all
right
i'll
look
into
the
chumash
connection
and
see
if
there's
any
ritual
significance
to
the
ear
removal
you
all
right
oh
i'll
try
and
restrain
myself
from
eating
uncooked
potatoes
and
cranberries
so
what
do
you
think
i
think
perhaps
she's
a
little
lonely
but
i
meant
about
the
murder
yeah
well
this
danger
your
friend
has
some
ominous
vision
about
buffy
it's
all
terribly
vague
i
mean
there
are
other
things
happening
on
this
campus
i'm
glad
that
you're
watching
out
for
her
but
i
feel
i
should
remind
you
that
she's
not
helpless
and
it's
not
your
job
to
keep
her
safe
all
right
but
i
feel
we
should
tell
her
i
don't
like
keeping
this
secret
um
i'm
assuming
that
there's
some
connection
to
the
old
mission
something
is
angry
about
being
disturbed
no
ok
well
i'll
see
about
contacting
him
where
are
you
going
it's
not
fair
you
know
that's
what
she'd
say
you
can
see
her
but
she
can't
see
you
it's
clear
we're
dealing
with
a
spirit
of
some
kind
it's
very
common
for
indian
spirits
to
change
to
animal
form
sorry
oh
right
yes
yes
um
always
behind
on
the
terms
still
trying
not
to
refer
to
you
lot
as
bloody
colonials
this
spirit
warrior
hus
you
called
him
has
killed
innocent
people
i
don't
think
i
have
a
ricer
well
do
you
have
one
at
home
we'll
mash
them
with
forks
much
like
the
pilgrims
must
have
did
you
catch
the
part
about
the
innocent
people
what's
all
that
the
chumash
were
peaceful
i
like
mushy
peas
they
cut
off
their
ears
he's
recreating
all
the
wrongs
done
to
his
people
and
it's
up
to
us
to
stop
him
no
i
think
perhaps
we
won't
help
the
angry
spirit
with
his
rape
and
pillage
and
murder
if
the
history
books
are
full
of
them
i'd
say
they
already
are
it's
not
exactly
ours
to
give
and
i
think
your
sympathy
for
his
plight
has
blinded
you
to
certain
urgent
facts
we
have
to
stop
this
thing
willow
that's
not
fair
willow
i
i
have
reason
to
believe
buffy
herself
may
be
in
particular
danger
from
this
menace
that's
not
terribly
stealthy
of
him
but
buffy
doesn't
know
well
that's
good
but
this
is
why
i
think
we
should
all
keep
a
level
head
in
this
xander
you
look
like
death
i'm
sure
that'll
clear
everything
right
up
it's
sort
of
an
end
in
itself
no
but
you
freed
his
spirit
and
after
a
century
of
unrest
he
saw
you
as
one
of
his
oppressors
but
why
the
others
why
them
particularly
yes
and
we've
never
faced
this
sort
of
spirit
before
we
really
don't
know
what
will
kill
it
figuratively
speaking
or
bind
it
or
whatever
yes
willow
we
all
appreciate
your
perspective
oh
i
think
we
do
buffy
xander's
in
real
danger
are
you
sure
the
solution
is
pie
hus
won't
stop
vengeance
is
never
sated
buffy
hatred
is
a
cycle
all
he
will
do
is
kill
no
it's
fairly
unlikely
what
oh
yes
um
on
the
bookcase
the
victims
apart
from
xander
hus
has
targeted
authority
figures
father
gabriel
the
curator
of
the
cultural
center
who
else
fits
this
pattern
likely
candidate
we
should
warn
him
i
made
these
points
earlier
but
fine
no
one
listens
to
me
i'll
keep
on
looking
for
a
solution
it
isn't
working
get
down
hhello
yes

yes
wwwe're
well
aware
of
that

wewe're
under
siege
now
actually

thank
you
asomeone
uh
we
need
a
plan
over
there
buffy
uh
the
leader
upstairs
2
by
the
living
room
windows
uh
one
through
the
window
by
the
door
bit
busy
over
here
turkey
came
out
rather
splendidly
violence
does
that
instinct
takes
over
good
work
buffy
on
both
counts
well
you
know
you
should
be
very
pleased
