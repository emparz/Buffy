i
think
she
means
oh
i
miss
the
free
hot
dogs
on
sticks
what
a
load
of
horse
hooey
yeah
thanksgiving
isn't
about
blending
of
2
cultures
it's
about
one
culture
wiping
out
another
and
then
they
make
animated
specials
about
the
part
where
with
the
maize
and
the
big
big
belt
buckles
they
don't
show
you
the
next
scene
where
all
the
bison
die
and
squanto
takes
a
musket
ball
in
the
stomach
well
yeah
sort
of
that's
why
she
doesn't
celebrate
thanksgiving
or
columbus
day
you
know
the
destruction
of
the
indigenous
peoples
i
know
it
sounds
a
little
overwrought
but
really
she'sshe's
right
verydiggy
while
they
were
pulling
xander
out
i
heard
a
couple
of
the
anthro
professors
talking
about
it
man
were
they
excited
it's
the
old
sunnydale
mission
which
everyone
thought
was
lost
is
there
something
out
there
huge
earthquake
in
1812
everyone
just
assumed
the
mission
was
leveled
instead
they
built
right
over
it
it's
like
what
happened
in
the
thirties
with
that
church
the
master
was
in
doesn't
it
make
you
wonder
what
else
is
there
like
right
under
our
feet
oh
right
outside
we
hear
students
running
mad
through
the
halls
with
excitement
man
it's
crazy
out
there
it
looks
like
a
lot
of
lucky
moms
are
gonna
be
getting
brimming
baskets
of
dirty
laundry
hmm
it's
a
turvytopsy
world
buffy
earlier
you
agreed
with
me
about
thanksgiving
it's
a
sham
it's
all
about
death
you're
not
gonna
jokeyrhyme
your
way
out
of
this
one
well
i
suppose
there
could
be
slight
yams
ooh
we
could
not
invite
anya
i'll
never
get
used
to
this
one
day
she's
at
the
friendship
ceremony
the
next
day
she's
on
the
news
the
coroner's
office
said
she
was
missing
an
ear
so
i'm
thinking
maybe
we're
looking
for
a
witch
there's
some
great
spells
that
work
much
better
with
an
ear
in
the
mix
oror
maybe
an
earharvesting
demon
thatit's
like
building
another
demon
completely
out
of
ears
orooh
thought
we're
just
assuming
someone
else
cut
off
the
ear
what
if
it
was
selfinflicted
like
van
gogh
no
she
cut
off
her
ear
then
killed
herself
then
dumped
the
body
i'm
really
off
my
game
aren't
i
what's
it
look
like
but
you
have
whipped
cream
i
saw
it
in
giles'
fridge
hey
and
then
later
we
can
churn
our
own
butter
and
make
sweaters
out
of
sheep
hi
well
i'm
just
gonna
let
you
two
look
they're
selling
coffee
in
the
coffee
shop
yum
oh
angel
evil
you're
all
evil
again
what's
going
on
so
tell
her
help
her
see
i
don't
get
that
all
this
leaving
for
her
own
good
garbage
because
that's
what
it
is
you
can't
just
give
up
because
there's
obstacles
what
kind
sorry
my
stuff
yeah
i
know
hey
is
cordelia
really
working
for
you
'cause
that's
gotta
be
a
special
experience
of
all
the
people
you
could've
hired
right
well
how
can
i
help
hey
peas
atrocities
i
got
the
full
poop
on
the
chumash
indians
and
our
fabulous
buried
mission
atrocities
i
didn't
have
time
i
was
busy
reading
about
the
chumash
war
oh
they
were
peaceful
all
right
they
were
fluffy
indigenous
kittens
till
we
came
along
they
won't
be
mushy
how
about
imprisonment
forced
labor
herded
like
animals
into
a
mission
full
of
bad
european
diseases
not
even
a
diorama
and
it
gets
better
the
few
chumash
who
tried
to
rebel
were
hanged
and
when
a
group
was
accused
of
stealing
cattle
they
were
killed
men
women
and
children
and
for
proof
to
bring
back
to
their
accusers
are
you
sure
we
shouldn't
be
helping
him
well
ok
no
but
we
should
be
helping
him
redress
his
wrongs
bring
the
atrocities
to
light
giving
his
land
back
i
don't
think
you
wanna
help
i
think
you
just
wanna
slay
the
demon
then
go
la
la
la
ok
unfeeling
guy
you
mean
angel
i
saw
him
too
i
think
he's
lost
his
edge
oh
no
not
a
peep
and
i
happen
to
think
mine
is
the
level
head
and
yours
is
the
one
things
would
roll
off
of
are
you
ok
yeah
this
has
a
better
account
of
everything
it
lists
the
various
well
the
important
thing
is
not
to
panic
well
they
did
suffer
from
malaria
some
smallpox
you
know
syphilis
but
basically
well
but
this
is
probably
mystical
and
it'll
all
go
away
as
soon
as
we
still
don't
know
what
we're
gonna
do
well
maybe
i
can
find
something
let's
give
him
some
land
sarcasm
accomplishes
nothing
giles
maybe
there's
a
wiccan
spell
that
can
cure
it
something
regular
medicine
doesn't
know
ooh
there
was
a
potion
sage
saltonion
he's
just
doing
what
was
done
to
him
like
you've
never
woken
up
cranky
there
are
2
sides
to
it
it's
not
that
simple
anyway
he's
a
spirit
not
a
demon
again
with
the
killing
i
don't
think
anyone
appreciates
the
truth
of
the
situation
you
said
you
were
gonna
kill
me
then
buffy
it's
true
he
had
trouble
performing
i'm
not
gonna
help
you
kill
him
i'm
not
on
board
buffy
this
isn't
a
western
we're
not
at
fortgiles
with
the
cavalry
coming
to
save
us
it's
one
lonely
guy
oppressed
warrior
guy
who's
just
trying
to
i
didn't
say
he
was
right
we
don't
wanna
fight
anyone
if
we
could
talk
to
him
i'll
go
i
need
the
air
maybe
if
anya
hadn't
opened
the
conversation
with
'everybody
got
both
ears'
so
what
do
we
do
now
angel's
here
to
protect
buffy
she's
not
supposed
to
know
he's
here
angel
do
you
have
something
new
still
at
giles'
she
sent
us
to
check
on
dean
guerrero
we
think
he's
going
after
someone
in
charge
a
leader
buffy
we
gotta
get
over
there
whydon'tyoudie
i
feel
lousy
it's
justdid
you
see
me
2
seconds
of
conflict
with
an
indigenous
person
and
i
turned
into
general
custer
but
mean
entire
siege
i
don't
know
seemed
kinda
right
to
me
a
bunch
of
anticipation
a
big
fight
and
now
we're
all
sleepy
and
we
did
all
survive
well
maybe
we
started
a
new
tradition
this
year
maybe
not
but
at
least
we
all
worked
together
it
was
like
old
times
