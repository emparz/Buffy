aren't
you
two
young
to
be
a
bartender
i
don't
believe
this
is
entirely
on
the
up
and
up
looking
at
it
i'm
pregnant
by
my
stepbrother
who'd
rather
be
with
my
best
friend
whose
left
me
with
no
place
to
live
no
food
except
this
bottle
of
wild
turkey
which
i
drank
all
up
that
was
me
being
tanked
and
friendless
for
ya
oz
bronze
date
parker
buffy
and
as
my
best
friend
you
need
to
stop
thinking
about
parker
he's
no
good
there
are
men
better
men
wherein
the
mind
is
stronger
than
the
penis
i
mean
i'm
sorry
do
be
so
course
but
i
feel
strongly
about
stinky
parker
man
not
interested
you
got
troubles
tell
em
to
the
bartender
i
had
to
kill
a
man
i
copied
out
my
notes
for
psyche
since
you
were
so
elsewhere
this
morning
we
could
go
back
to
your
place
i
could
make
you
soup
do
you
know
her
my
name's
veruca
i'm
in
a
band
i'm
oz
i'm
in
a
band
too
oh
and
this
is
willow
oh
how
fun
and
creepy
groovy
buff
have
you
heard
of
this
veruca
chick
dresses
like
faith
voice
like
an
albatross
what
did
you
do
with
buffy
you
didn't
not
with
parker
again
four
oh
ow
oh
buffy
are
you
okay
do
you
wanna
talk
about
it
and
then
group
sex
drowning
your
troubles
over
parker
mind
frying
man
he
deserves
a
slow
and
torturous
death
by
spiderbites
well
for
today
we'll
just
have
to
throw
spitballs
at
his
neck
in
class
uh
getting
dressed
would
be
fun
to
buffy
buffy
are
you
okay
yeah
i've
been
up
at
the
library
how
are
you
feeling
well
you
weren't
in
class
again
shy
two
veruca
shows
in
two
nights
are
you
sure
you
wanna
share
your
groupie
i
think
i'm
gonna
study
because
of
the
fun
see
ya
yes
i
wanted
to
give
you
a
piece
of
my
mind
i'm
tired
of
you
men
and
your
manness
buffy's
really
hurting
right
now
in
fact
she's
in
need
of
a
big
mental
tidy
parker
how
could
you
do
this
to
her
she
shared
something
very
intimate
with
you
and
you
act
like
it's
nothing
more
than
a
bag
of
some
kind
of
snack
food
yes
followed
by
an
admission
of
undeniable
guilt
but
go
on
go
on
people
like
buffy
aand
me
assume
that
intimacy
means
friendship
and
respect
people
shouldn't
have
to
ask
first
if
you're
going
to
be
eyeing
other
prospects
tomorrow
maybe
well
getting
to
know
people
is
good
okay
i
mean
i
feel
you've
shown
me
a
perspective
i
haven't
really
thought
much
about
before
what
was
it
you
wanted
to
tell
me
me
too
i
mean
with
you
you
know
i'm
wondering
something
about
you
just
how
gullible
do
you
think
i
am
i
mean
with
you
gentle
eyes
and
your
shy
smile
and
your
ability
to
talk
openly
even
to
me
you're
unbelievable
this
isn't
sharing
this
isn't
connecting
it's
the
pleasure
principle
that's
right
i
got
your
number
id
boy
the
only
thing
you're
thinking
about
is
how
long
you
can
jump
on
my
bones
i
mean
you
men
it's
all
about
the
sex
you
find
a
woman
drag
her
to
your
den
do
whatever's
necessary
just
as
long
as
you
get
the
sex
i
tell
you
men
haven't
changed
since
the
dawn
of
time
you
see
buffy's
still
in
there
yes
please
