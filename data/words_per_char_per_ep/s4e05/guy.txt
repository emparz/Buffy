this
fine
bartender
from
his
duty
a
man's
gotta
make
a
living

are
about

like
the
two
of
you
were
having
quite
the
meeting
of
minds
possibly
debating

geopolitical
ramifications

a
take
on
that

a
perfect
venue
here
for
conducting
a
little
sociometry
a
bipolar
continuum
of
attraction
and
rejection

your
sociological
statuses

foresee

a
dyad

are
the
future
of
this
country
and

our
bowl
of
peanuts
