buffy
i
don't
know
what
to
say
after
the
way
i've
treated
you
and
now
i
owe
you
my
life
it's
everything
you're
everything
and
i'm
going
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
get
you
to
forgive
me
do
you
think
one
day
you
might
buffy
i
don't
know
what
to
say
after
the
way
i've
treated
you
and
now
i
owe
you
my
life
can
you
ever
forgive
me
hey
did
you
want
something
oh
i
don't
get
what
you
mean
what
did
i
do
willow
i'm
not
sure
i
need
to
explain
my
actions
here
but
if
that's
what
you
want
some
relationships
center
on
a
deep
emotional
tie
or
a
loyal
friendship
or
something
but
most
are
just
two
people
passing
through
life
enriching
or
aggravating
each
other's
lives
briefly
just
for
one
night
can't
two
people
who
feel
an
attraction
come
together
and
create
something
wonderful
and
then
go
back
to
their
lives
the
next
day
better
for
it
but
never
over
analyzing
it
or
wanting
it
to
be
more
than
it
was
i
have
she
should
too
people
shouldn't
have
to
preface
casual
sex
with
“just
so
you
know
i'll
never
grow
any
older
with
you”
it
takes
the
fire
out
of
it
willow
i
don't
regret
what
happened
or
what
we
did
but
i
am
sorry
that
buffy's
hurting
and
if
i
mislead
her
than
i'm
sorry
for
that
too
i
didn't
mean
to
i'm
impressed
that
you
care
so
much
about
her
you're
a
good
friend
i
don't
mean
this
in
a
bragging
way
but
i
do
get
to
know
a
lot
of
women
but
i
haven't
found
the
one
yet
i've
yet
to
find
the
girl
that
i
can
just
sit
with
feel
totally
at
ease
feeling
whatever's
on
my
mind
or
even
sit
with
comfortably
in
silence
willow
can
i
tell
you
something
kinda
private
just
that
i've
enjoyed
talking
to
you
here
tonight
what
what
look
if
you
think
that
i'm
oh
god
help
me
i
can't
breathe

buffy
oh
god
what
do
we
do
buffy
buffy
i
i
dunno
how
to
say
this
i'm
sorry
for
how
i
treated
you
before
it
was
wrong
of
me
and
i'm
sorry
you
were
great
tonight
really
i
might
not
deserve
this
but
do
you
think
that
you
could
forgive
me
