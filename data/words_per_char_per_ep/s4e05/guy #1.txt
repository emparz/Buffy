the
thing
that
the
modern
day
society
failed
to
realize
is
that
all
the
socioeconomical
and
psychological
problems
inherent
in
modern
society
can
be
solved
by
the
judicious
application
of
way
too
much
beer
evil
good
these
are
moral
absolutes
that
predate
the
absolution
of
malt
and
fine
hops

see
wait
where
was
i
beer
had
the
earliest
morality
developed
under
the
influence
of

would
be
no

would
just
be
kinda
nice

cool
everything
would
be
different
