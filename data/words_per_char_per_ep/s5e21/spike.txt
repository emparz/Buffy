crafty
glory's
worked
the
kind
of
mojo

little
prestochangeo
instantly
forgets

yours
truly
being
somewhat
other
than
human

stands
immune
kewpie

much
as
a
demon
but
still
bookish
all
tuned
in
to
the
nastier
corners
of
this
our
magic
world
it's
a
bit
of
a
last
resort
really
but
still
we
might
persuade
him
to
suss
out
glory's
game
plan
sound
worthy
