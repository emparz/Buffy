don't
be
death
is
my
gift
it's
really
not
that
complicated
it's
what
i
do
i
mean
come
on
you've
known
me

for
how
long
it's
what
i'm
here
for
it's
all
i
am
what
i
keep
telling
you
will
ii
figured
it
out
death
is
my
gift
doing
what
why
will
i
did
this
i
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about
'scuse
me
my
gift
this
is
what
i
do
don't
go
there
will
do
i
just
for
a
second
i
put
a
book
back
for
giles
i
can't
beat
glory
i
didn't
just
know
it
and
in
that
second
of
knowing
it
will
i
just
wanted
it
over
and
i
would
grieve
people
would
feel
sorry
for
me
but
it
would
be
over
and
i
imagined
what
a
relief
it
would
be
i
killed
dawn
i
know
i
could
have
done
something
better
but
i
didn't
i
was
off
by
some
fraction
of
a
second
i
killed
my
sister
what
i
got
dawn
killed
but
what
if
i
can't
wait
