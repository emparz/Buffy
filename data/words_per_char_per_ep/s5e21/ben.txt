can't
kill
the
girl
dawn
has
glory
hurt
you
where
is
it
all
the
blood
i
can
feel
it

still
warm
and

wet
glory
oh
god
she
slaughtered
hundreds
of
men
but
i
can
feel
them

breaking
i'm
remembering
her
aren't
i
the
things
she's
done

things
she's
going
to
do
how
could
she
do
this
how
i'll
take
you
as
far
as
i
can
ditch
you
before
she
comes
back
just
stay
close
to
me
don't
look
back
shh
stay
very
still
i
said
leave
her
alone
do
you
ever
stop
talking
i
don't
know
which
is
worse
waking
up
in
a
dress
not
knowing
where
i've
been
or
having
to
hear
all
your
selfinvolved
ranting
wrong
glory
i'm
no
animal
this
is
humanity
you're
feeling
welcome
to
the
world
i
won't
let
you
hurt
her
glory
you
really
think
i'll
just
let
that
happen
you
need
her
blood
when
i'm
through
there
won't
be
enough
left
to
fill
a
bottle
cap
then
you
hellbitch
have
nowhere
left
glory
to
go
huh
you
can't
you're
immortal
do
you
really
believe
with
all
i
know
that
you
can
trick
me
and
i
disappear
i
won't
make
a
deal
with
you
glory
i
believe
you
that's
not
the
problem
you
make
me
immortal
then
what
i'd
have
to
kill
her
to
do
it
and
i
won't
be
able
to
live
with
that
not
even
for
a
day
forget
about
eternity
i
can't
accept
that
i'm
sorry
don't
make
this
harder
than
it
already
is
i'm
sorry
i
got
no
choice
it's
you
or
me
