dreaming
of
me
again
aren't
you
poor
spike
he
still
thinks
i
believe
in
him
be
realistic
i
don't
even
believe
in
myself
at
least
not
enough
to
risk
my
skin
to
save
your
ass
not
enough
to
face
that
i'm
sorry
spike
but
you
need
to
accept
this
you
know
it
never
would've
worked
out
you
need
to
let
go
so
we
can
both
move
on
i
promise
soon
it'll
all
beâ€”
i
just
love
having
you
all
to
myself
