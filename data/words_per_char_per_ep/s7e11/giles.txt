molly
why
don't
you
show
our
new
houseguest
where
the
kitchen
is
i'm
sure
she's
hungry
after
her
travels
everything
all
right
i
must
warn
the
coven
to
be
cautious
i—i
don't
know
buffy
i've
exhausted
all
the
sources
i
have
left
with
little
result
the
watcher's
records
are
still
really
all
we
have
to
go
on
there
is
one
avenue
that
we
haven't
tried
yet—
beljoxa's
eye
beljoxa's
eye
it's
an
oracle
type
creature
that
exists
in
a
dark
dimension
the
point
is
only
demons
can
open
the
gateway
to
it
you're
still
friends
in
the
fold
murderous
acquaintances
anyway
i'm
sorry
perhaps
we
could
skip
the
nostalgia—
sorry
no
no
carry
on
um
perhaps
this
might
change
your
mind
you
help
us
and
the
slayer
won't
kill
your
clientele
and
burn
your
establishment
to
the
ground
come
on
where's
the
beljoxa's
eye
i
refuse
to
believe
that
there
must
be
some
way
to
destroy
it
are
you
saying
that
the
first
will
succeed
in—in
wiping
out
the
line
of
slayers
if
the
first
has
been
around
for
all
time
then
why
hasn't
it
attempted
something
like
this
before
why
now
opportunity
then
what
has
caused
the
disruption
what—what
is
responsible
for
letting
this
happen
are
you
all
right
it's
not
because
she
died
the
beljoxa's
eye
was
quite
clear
about
that
in
its
enigmatic
way
it's
because
she
lives
again
buffy's
not
responsible
for
that
