know
anything
or
didn't

beljoxa's
eye

any
of
the
answers

looking
for
why

a
heart
six
spleens
two
stomachs
half
a
brain

but
no
heart

was
one
date

wasn't
even
a
date

just
happened
to
be
invited
to
the
same
massacre
and—and

on
me
after
i
had
a
few
those

this
tiny
little
gateway
to
the
beljoxa's
eye
for
me
and
i'll—
you
and
i
will
go—

have
sex
with
you

rejecting
my
offer
of
sexual
bribery

with
something
a
little
bit
more
demony
something

don't
understand
how
buffy's
death
mucked
up
the
whole
slayer
mojo

not
like
she
hasn't
died
before
oh

the
ones
who
brought
buffy
back

the
reason

here
the
reason
those
girls
were
murdered

our
fault

been
better
off
if
buffy
had
just
stayed
dead
