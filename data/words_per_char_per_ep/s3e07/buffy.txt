the
magic
mitten
thingy

all
the
tragedy
masks

you
think
but
he's
better
now
what
is
this
demons
anonymous
i
don't
need
an
intervention
here
i
was
going
to
tell
you
i
was
iit
was
just
that
i
i
didn't
know
why
he
came
back
i
just
wanted
to
wait
i'm
not
going
to
we're
not
together
like
that
you
were
spying
on
me
what
gives
you
the
right
it
was
an
accident
it
was
wrong
okay
i
know
that
and
i
know
that
it
can't
happen
again
but
you
guys
have
to
believe
me
i
would
never
put
you
in
any
danger
if
i
thought
for
a
second
that
angel
was
going
to
hurt
anyone
but
he's
better
now
i
swear
look
you
guys
he's
the
one
that
found
the
glove
of
myhnegon
hhe's
keeping
it
safe
for
us
in
the
mansion
you
would
just
love
an
excuse
to
hurt
him
wouldn't
you
right
this
is
all
nobility
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
jealousy
don't
you
start
with
me
thanks
for
the
bail
in
there
i
know
this
is
a
lot
to
absorb
but
angel
did
find
the
glove
and
that
was
a
good
hey
so
on
a
scale
of
one
to
a
million
how
much
are
you
hating
me
right
now
yeah
i
guess
none
of
the
above
i'm
gonna
try
and
kill
this
lagos
guy
peace
offering
to
giles
yep
but
lagos
doesn't
know
that
i
figure
sooner
or
later
he's
bound
to
show
up
at
that
crypt
looking
for
it
that's
my
brilliant
plan
i
tried
calling
but
no
one
was
home
look
if
you're
feeling
any
demonophobia
please
splitting
is
totally
an
option
you're
not
the
one
in
trouble
with
giles
how
long
do
you
think
he
can
stay
angry
at
me
anyway
yeah
i
can't
really
blame
him
it's
weird
though
now
that
my
secret
angel
it's
all
out
in
the
open
i
feel
better
you
have
no
idea
not
really
it's
too
much
pressure
after
a
while
it
even
makes
the
fun
parts
not
so
fun
what
makes
you
think
all
this
secret
stuff
is
sexy
anyway
what
now
we're
talking
sorry
about
that
so
what
were
you
saying
your
secret's
safe
with
me
come
on
let's
go
bring
giles

happiness

gonna
be
psyched
that
we
showed
up
stuffy
old
mrs
post
oh
my
god
what
happened
giles
what
happened
what
happened
what
makes
you
think
that
angel
had
anything
to
do
with
this
so
you
just
assume
what
did
you
tell
her
how
much
of
a
head
start
does
she
have
go
through
giles'
research
figure
out
how
to
destroy
the
glove
i
can't
let
you
do
it
faith
there's
a
lot
that
you
don't
understand
faith

can
figure
this
out

sound
funny
coming
from
someone
that

spent
a
lot
of
time
kicking
your
face
