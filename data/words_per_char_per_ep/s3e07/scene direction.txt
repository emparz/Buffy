a
look

walks
around

looking
around
at
the
few
stacks
there
are
in
the
study
area
of
the
library
apparently
unaware
that
the
main
stacks
are
up
the
stairs
and
through
a
set
of
french
doors
well
out
of
view
giles
slips
on
his
glasses
giles
gives
her
a
confused
look

thinly
gwendolyn
interrupts

away
knowing
that
while
his

a
hopeful
look

not
at
all
happy
with
the
situation
gwendolyn
to
giles
that
takes
giles
by
surprise
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
innocently
giles
glares
at
her
she
just
gives
it
right
back
to
him
gwendolyn
inhales
giles
taken
aback
buffy
surprised
gwendolyn
condescendingly
giles
a
bit
flustered
giles
looks
at
the
books
on
the
table
yes
uh
he
sits
at
the
table
and
begins
to
look
through
one
of
the
books
giles
stops
looking
very
taken
aback
he
begins
to
seethe
giles
folds
his
hands
over
his
books
and
looks
up
at
her
giles
turns
his
head
away
from
her
and
takes
off
his
glasses
buffy
gives
faith
a
look
faith
just
gives
gwendolyn
an
even
stare
gwendolyn
takes
a
deep
breath
giles
puts
his
glasses
back
on
and
starts
to
look
through
his
books
again
giles
lets
his
book
drop
to
the
table
and
makes
a
point
of
looking
directly
away
from
her
rubbing
his
fingers
keeping
his
cool
gwendolyn
faith
almost
startles
she
gives
faith
a
thin
smile
and
walks
from
the
library
faith
gives
buffy
a
glance
then
follows
her
out
giles
visibly
relaxes
when
they've
gone
he
slaps
his
glasses
onto
the
table
and
leans
his
lips
into
his
fist
giles
lowers
his
fist
his
expression
indicates
he's
considering
it
anyway
but
soon
discards
the
notion
giles
stands
up
buffy
glances
over
at
angel
watching
his
elegant
movements
she
turns
her
attention
back
to
the
exercise
and
crosses
her
right
wrist
over
her
left
they
both
sweep
their
crossed
arms
in
a
wide
arc
from
left
to
right
and
then
draw
their
hands
in
to
their
waists
and
make
a
quarter
turn
to
their
left
so
that
buffy
has
her
back
to
angel
they
both
extend
their
arms
and
slowly
raise
them
never
stopping
their
fluid
movements
until
their
hands
are
again
held
high
angel
takes
the
two
steps
over
to
buffy
and
puts
his
hands
over
hers
buffy
looks
up
at
his
hands
on
hers
as
he
pulls
her
arms
down
and
around
her
she
slowly
turns
to
face
him
and
angles
her
face
up
toward
him
their
lips
almost
meet
when
buffy
suddenly
pulls
away
and
walks
over
to
one
of
the
two
couches
set
at
right
angles
to
each
other
to
get
her
things
angel
turns
away
a
confused
expression
on
his
face
buffy
pulls
on
her
backpack
buffy
starts
to
leave
angel
pulls
on
his
shirt
buffy
stops
buffy
quietly
angel
looks
at
her
and
steps
toward
her
as
he
buttons
his
shirt
buffy
turns
to
face
him
buffy
smiles
weakly
buffy
loses
the
smile
bad
bad
habit
to
be
broken
buffy
with
resolve
they
both
look
at
each
other
for
a
long
moment
knowing
it's
just
not
that
easy
buffy
weakly
and
desperately
angel
looks
away
as
buffy
turns
again
to
go
she
only
gets
a
couple
of
steps
when
she
sighs
and
turns
to
face
angel
again
angel
faces
her
again
upon
hearing
that
demon's
name
buffy
angel
sits
suddenly
worried
buffy
sees
his
worried
look
angel
can't
bring
himself
to
look
at
her
again
and
so
just
stares
off
into
space
buffy
turns
and
heads
out
of
the
mansion
angel
watches
her
back
as
she
goes
and
when
she's
gone
he
gets
up
to
start
some
work
of
his
own
willow

standing
behind
the
railing
of
the
stack

standing
at

begins
to
pace

and
yanks
off
his
glasses

points
at

with
his
glasses
xander
gives
giles
an
annoyed
smile
he
makes
frustrated
tracks
into
his
office
xander
stares
after
him
for
a
moment
then
starts
up
the
stairs
to
the
stack
level
for
more
research
willow
steps
over
to
meet
him
they
head
into
the
stacks
they
stop
at
a
spot
where
a
few
books
are
lying
open
on
the
floor
and
sit
down
xander
takes
one
of
them
and
starts
to
look
through
it
she
leans
forward
and
rests
her
head
in
her
hands
for
a
moment
then
starts
rubbing
her
temples
with
her
fingers
she
moans
as
she
rubs
xander
looks
over
at
her
concerned
he
sets
down
his
book
nudges
a
bit
closer
and
reaches
over
to
do
the
rubbing
for
her
when
she
feels
his
fingers
at
her
temples
willow
drops
her
own
hands
into
her
lap
and
lets
him
minister
to
her
letting
out
a
few
more
moans
xander
continues
rubbing
xander
keeps
rubbing
xander
finally
stops
he
leans
back
away
from
her
she
sits
up
a
bit
he
takes
his
book
again
to
continue
his
research
suddenly
willow
reaches
for
him
grabs
his
face
and
plants
a
hard
kiss
on
his
lips
xander
responds
and
puts
his
hands
around
her
to
pull
her
closer
they
kiss
passionately
for
a
few
seconds
when
giles
suddenly
comes
walking
by
his
attention
focused
on
a
book
in
his
hands
as
he
reads
willow
and
xander
don't
notice
him
at
all
they
stop
kissing
and
quickly
scramble
to
their
feet
they
wipe
and
cover
their
mouths
in
guilt
but
aren't
yet
sure
if
they've
been
caught
since
giles
is
looking
at
a
bookcase
willow
bites
her
nails
nervously
xander
trying
to
be
cool
giles
faces
them
it's
uh
housed
in
the
von
hauptman
family
crypt
giles
continues
his
reading
xander
starts
out
xander
leaves
willow
nervously
giles
looks
up
from
his
book
he
starts
back
out
of
the
stacks
willow
lets
out
a
deep
sigh
ridden
with
guilt
and
halfway
convinced
that
they've
been
caught
buffy
gets
a
doubtful
look
from
faith
really
i've
read
about
them
faith
laughs
they
stop
walking
faith
shrugs
faith
shrugs
buffy
looks
away
buffy
smiles
thinly
faith
nods
down
the
street
faith
goes
she
watches
her
go
for
a
moment
before
turning
and
heading
home
faith
to
herself
she
starts
to
run
toward
him
and
jumps
into
a
flying
side
kick
to
lagos'
back
he
hardly
budges
and
turns
his
head
to
see
who
is
disturbing
him
faith
grabs
his
arm
and
whips
him
around
to
face
her
she
backhand
punches
him
in
the
face
and
instantly
follows
up
with
another
swing
to
his
face
then
punches
him
in
the
gut
and
again
in
the
face
she
pushes
him
away
slightly
to
get
some
distance
between
them
and
then
roundhouse
kicks
him
in
the
side
unfazed
and
tired
of
the
interruption
lagos
grabs
her
by
the
neck
and
throws
her
high
and
far
she
slams
into
the
side
of
a
mausoleum
and
falls
to
the
ground
lagos
turns
his
attention
back
to
the
open
coffin
faith
scrambles
to
her
feet
and
starts
to
run
at
him
again
lagos
hears
her
coming
this
time
and
turns
to
face
her
she
tries
to
grab
his
neck
but
he
blocks
her
arm
and
does
an
uppercut
to
faith's
diaphragm
which
makes
her
airborne
once
again
she
hits
the
ground
hard
and
starts
to
struggle
for
breath
lagos
ignores
her
and
goes
back
to
his
rummaging
he
pulls
the
last
of
the
coffin's
contents
out
sees
that
it's
nothing
he
wants
and
throws
it
aside
in
disgust
he
wastes
no
time
getting
out
of
there
stomping
right
past
faith
not
giving
her
even
so
much
as
another
glance
with
her
breath
knocked
out
of
her
faith
is
unable
to
get
up
to
pursue
him
xander
smiling
dripping
with
sarcasm
he
stops
in
his
tracks
when
he
thinks
he
hears
a
noise
sure
enough
a
second
later
he
can
hear
the
sound
of
stone
grinding
against
stone
coming
from
inside
the
crypt
he
swiftly
ducks
behind
a
group
of
bushes
crouches
down
and
waits
to
see
who
will
come
out
a
figure
soon
comes
out
of
the
crypt
and
pulls
the
door
closed
in
its
arms
it
holds
something
wrapped
in
a
bunch
of
rags
the
figure
turns
its
back
to
xander
as
it
grabs
the
outer
iron
gate
and
swings
it
closed
as
well
xander
rises
up
just
a
bit
so
he
can
better
see
who
it
is
the
figure
turns
around
again
and
begins
to
cautiously
make
its
way
out
of
the
graveyard
as
it
nears
xander
he
sees
that
it's
angel
xander
doesn't
take
his
eyes
off
of
him
as
he
walks
past
when
angel
is
far
enough
ahead
of
him
xander
comes
out
from
behind
the
bushes
pulls
out
his
stake
and
starts
to
follow
there
to
his
shock
he
sees
buffy
with
angel
kissing
passionately
angel's
mansion
he
and
buffy
are
kissing
passionately
the
camera
circles
around
them
as
they
continue
kissing
suddenly
buffy
breaks
it
off
and
takes
a
couple
of
steps
backward
and
looks
away
from
his
face
angel
confused
buffy
looks
up
at
him
angel
still
confused
angel
doesn't
know
how
to
respond
to
that
he
puts
his
hand
to
his
forehead
buffy
heads
over
to
her
things
on
the
couch
she
starts
to
pull
on
her
jacket
angel
steps
over
and
takes
it
from
her
hands
buffy
looks
up
to
him
waiting
for
an
explanation
he
leads
her
by
the
hand
over
to
a
pedestal
where
the
thing
he
got
from
the
crypt
lies
still
wrapped
up
in
rags
he
unwraps
the
rags
to
reveal
their
contents
it's
an
ancientlooking
glove

crashing
through

into
the
atrium

away
from

between

hard
back
at

doorway

does
a
diving
punch
knocking

in
the
head
and
making
her
cry
out
in
pain
cut
inside

makes
a
beeline
for
the
trunk
with
the
glove
she
throws
the
lid
open
and
unfolds
the
rags
wrapped
around
the
glove
reverently
she
takes
the
glove
out
of
the
trunk
and
cradles
it
in
her
hands
gwendolyn
smiling
wickedly
behind
her
willow
is
confused
by
her
words
and
actions
sensing
willow's
proximity
gwendolyn
swings
the
glove
around
in
a
wide
arc
hitting
her
in
the
face
she
falls
to
the
marble
floor
unconscious
buffy
grabs
onto
faith's
throat
and
faith
reaches
up
to
try
to
pry
buffy's
hand
off
of
her
cut
inside
gwendolyn
holds
the
glove
in
her
left
hand
and
looks
down
at
it
slowly
she
slides
her
right
arm
into
the
glove
once
it's
inside
she
makes
a
fist
with
the
clawed
fingers
suddenly
the
metal
claws
surrounding
the
glove's
opening
begin
closing
puncturing
her
arm
one
at
a
time
until
all
ten
have
become
permanently
embedded
in
her
forearm's
flesh
she
holds
up
her
gloved
arm
and
smiles
maniacally
at
the
sight
seemingly
oblivious
to
the
pain
she
extends
her
arm
above
her
up
toward
the
huge
skylight
and
recites
the
gaelic
spell
that
will
invoke
the
power
of
the
glove
up
in
the
sky
lightning
strikes
and
thunder
booms
outside
buffy
and
faith
stop
their
fighting
to
see
what's
going
on
inside
gwendolyn
breathes
excitedly
as
she
waits
for
the
power
to
become
hers
lightning
strikes
again
above
the
skylight
outside
buffy
and
faith
stare
at
gwendolyn
still
holding
onto
each
other
not
yet
willing
to
take
the
chance
on
releasing
their
grip
inside
gwendolyn
stares
intently
up
at
the
sky
awaiting
her
reward
for
being
the
new
wearer
of
the
glove
of
myhnegon
outside
the
two
slayers
realize
their
fight
is
no
longer
with
each
other
and
let
go
gwendolyn
allows
herself
to
be
distracted
lowers
her
gloved
arm
and
looks
over
at
faith
gwendolyn
smiling
maliciously
faith
and
buffy
both
look
at
her
in
disbelief
gwendolyn
once
again
raises
her
arm
to
the
sky
and
utters
the
words
that
will
call
forth
the
power
of
the
glove
on
the
floor
willow
wakes
up
and
turns
around
just
in
time
to
see
a
blindlingly
bright
bolt
of
lightning
smash
through
the
skylight
and
strike
the
glove
shards
of
shattered
glass
fall
everywhere
but
gwendolyn
ignores
them
and
rejoices
in
her
newfound
power
she
turns
to
face
the
slayers
and
extends
the
glove
toward
them
the
bolt
of
energy
leaps
from
the
glove
at
the
two
girls
they
scramble
out
of
the
way
and
the
bolt
hits
a
tree
in
the
atrium
instantly
setting
it
ablaze
buffy
and
faith
look
at
it
in
amazement
then
turn
their
attention
to
what
they
can
do
about
gwendolyn
angel
also
comes
to
now
and
quickly
takes
in
the
situation
willow
gets
to
her
feet
and
begins
backing
away
stiff
with
fear
staring
at
gwendolyn
in
shocked
horror
the
wouldbe
watcher
spins
around
and
aims
the
glove
at
her
thinking
fast
angel
jumps
to
his
feet
and
rushes
toward
willow
a
lightning
bolt
shoots
through
the
skylight
hits
the
glove
and
is
redirected
at
willow
angel
reaches
her
just
in
time
and
roughly
tackles
her
to
the
floor
out
of
harm's
way
the
bolt
hits
the
fireplace
instead
and
leaves
a
deep
scorch
mark
in
the
marble
outside
buffy
comes
up
with
a
plan
buffy
to
faith
faith
gets
to
her
feet
and
runs
into
the
mansion
gwendolyn
sees
her
coming
faith
ducks
into
a
hallway
and
keeps
running
gwendolyn
surmises
that
faith
will
appear
at
the
other
hallway
leading
from
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
and
extends
her
arm
in
that
direction
another
lightning
bolt
strikes
the
glove
and
is
sent
in
the
direction
of
the
hallway
just
as
faith
comes
running
out
of
it
she
dives
behind
the
couch
avoiding
the
blast
from
the
glove
thrilled
with
the
power
that
is
now
hers
gwendolyn
holds
the
glove
up
before
her
staring
at
it
with
lustful
desire
in
her
eyes
outside
buffy
sifts
through
the
broken
glass
finds
a
larger
shard
gets
to
her
feet
and
runs
into
the
mansion
gwendolyn
looks
over
at
buffy
in
surprise
buffy
throws
the
shard
of
glass
end
over
end
it
flies
like
a
spinning
blade
at
gwendolyn
and
slices
cleanly
through
her
upper
arm
severing
it
and
the
glove
from
her
body
with
nothing
to
control
it
now
the
power
of
the
glove
becomes
erratic
and
small
bolts
and
sparks
leap
from
it
in
random
directions
another
bolt
of
lightning
strikes
through
the
skylight
and
not
having
a
target
this
time
hits
gwendolyn
in
the
chest
with
a
few
small
tendrils
going
in
through
her
eyes
she
screams
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
as
her
body
begins
to
writhe
in
pain
everyone
watches
helplessly
as
she
keeps
screaming
and
the
lightning
bolts
keep
coming
buffy
shuts
her
eyes
to
the
sight
a
moment
later
with
one
final
bright
lightning
strike
what's
left
of
a
onearmed
gwendolyn
vanishes
in
a
bright
flash
of
light
and
energy
a
few
small
arcs
of
electricity
are
all
that
remain
as
the
last
of
the
energy
dissipates
and
the
mansion
is
again
in
relative
darkness
buffy
opens
her
eyes
willow
and
angel
get
to
their
feet
outside
xander
gets
up
also
and
heads
inside
faith
stands
up
from
behind
the
couch
all
that
is
left
in
the
center
of
the
room
are
bits
of
glass
and
framework
from
the
skylight
a
cloud
of
smoke
slowly
rising
upward
and
the
glove
of
myhnegon
with
gwendolyn's
severed
arm
still
firmly
in
its
grip
one
by
one
the
ten
claws
open
up
releasing
it
xander
nods
cordelia
gives
him
a
strange
look
willow
smiles
thinly
cordelia
doesn't
like
the
way
xander
phrased
that
and
crosses
her
arms
buffy
walks
up
the
stairs
to
meet
them
xander
sits
up
straight
buffy
looks
down
sadly
buffy
sits
next
to
xander
buffy
sighs
she
looks
over
at
xander
and
cordelia
they
both
look
back
buffy
hesitatingly
xander
pauses
buffy
raises
her
eyebrows
not
all
that
surprised
behind
her
giles
clears
his
throat
and
she
turns
to
face
him
he's
leaning
against
the
railing
with
a
large
bandage
on
his
left
temple
giles
cautiously
takes
the
steps
buffy
to
xander
she
gets
up
and
heads
out
of
the
lounge
willow
sighs
giles
slowly
sits
next
to
xander
there's
a
knock
on
faith's
door
buffy
opens
the
door
peeks
in
and
then
comes
into
the
room
faith
doesn't
respond
but
just
continues
paging
through
her
magazine
even
giles
faith
without
looking
up
faith
looks
up
amused
faith
tosses
the
magazine
aside
faith
nods
buffy
shakes
her
head
faith
shrugs
she
averts
her
eyes
and
stares
at
the
tv
buffy
takes
the
hint
and
turns
to
go
faith
shakes
her
head
having
a
second
thought
buffy
faces
her
expectantly
faith
reconsiders
again
for
a
long
moment
and
changes
her
mind
again
buffy
lowers
her
eyes
disappointed
slowly
she
turns
back
to
the
door
opens
it
and
leaves
faith
looks
around
her
spartan
room
and
inhales
and
exhales
deeply
cut
outside
buffy
goes
over
to
the
stairs
and
pauses
for
a
moment
staring
sadly
into
space
and
then
starts
down
the
steps
cut
inside
the
camera
pulls
back
on
faith
alone
in
her
bed
staring
out
of
the
window
for
a
moment
then
back
at
the
tv
