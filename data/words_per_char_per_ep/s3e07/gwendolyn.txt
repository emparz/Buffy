sloppy
you
telegraph
punches
leave
blind
sides
open
and
uh
for
a
schoolnight
slaying
take
entirely
too
much
time
which
one
of
you
is
faith
gwendolyn
post
mrs
your
new
watcher
duly
noted
and
fortunately
it's
not
up
to
you
mr
giles
where
do
you
keep
the
rest
of
your
books
yes
the
actual
library
oh
i
see
this
side
of
the
atlantic
i'm
sure
do
you
have
hume's
paranormal
encyclopedia
the
labyrinth
maps
of
malta
well
i
suppose
that
you
have
sir
robert
kane's
twilight
compendium
of
course
you
do
i
have
been
sent
by
the
council
for
a
very
important
reason
faith
needs
a
watcher
i
am
to
act
in
that
capacity
and
report
back
the
council
wishes
me
to
report
on
the
entire
situation
here
including
you
the
fact
is
there
is
talk
in
the
council
that
you
have
become
a
bit
too
american
a
demon
named
lagos
is
coming
here
to
the
hellmouth
mr
giles
an
illustration
of
lagos
if
you
please
perhaps
later
lagos
seeks
the
glove
of
myhnegon
no
record
of
this
glove's
full
power
exists
but
we
do
know
it
is
highly
dangerous
and
must
not
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
demon
lagos
must
be
stopped
well
if
it's
not
too
radical
a
suggestion
i
thought
we
might
kill
him
i
suggest
two
slayers
at
full
strength
for
a
coordinated
hunt
we
believe
the
glove
to
be
buried
in
a
tomb
somewhere
so
lagos
will
be
headed
for
the
cemetery
i
see
how
many
well
we'll
just
have
to
take
them
one
at
a
time
anything
in
your
books
that
might
pinpoint
the
exact
location
of
the
tomb
would
be
useful
but
then
we
cannot
ask
for
miracles
we
will
begin
tomorrow
at
sunset
faith
with
me
please
yes
engraved
by
father
theodore
of
wolsham
based
i
believe
on
very
sketchy
and
unreliable
folk
legends
the
pictures
are
fun
to
look
at
mr
giles
but
one
really
ought
to
read
the
nice
words
as
well
i
know
that
you
must
find
me
tiresome
but
it's
insidious
really
a
person
slips
up
on
the
little
things
and
soon
everything
has
gone
to
hell
in
a
handbasket
for
example
buffy
your
slayer
would
you
like
some
assistance
a
word
of
advice
vampires
rarely
knock
especially
in
daylight
so
this
is
your
home
faith
do
you
know
who
the
spartans
were
they
were
the
fiercest
warriors
known
to
ancient
greece
and
they
lived
in
quarters
very
much
like
these
do
you
know
why
because
a
true
fighter
needs
nothing
else
i'm
going
to
be
very
hard
on
you
faith
i
will
not
brook
insolence
or
laziness
and
i
will
not
allow
blunders
like
last
night's
attack
you
will
probably
hate
me
a
great
deal
of
the
time
but
i
will
make
you
a
better
slayer
and
that
will
keep
you
alive
you
have
to
trust
that
i
am
right
god
only
knows
what
mr
giles
has
been
filling
your
head
with
his
methods
are
unfathomable
to
me
i
find
him
entirely
confounding
but
that
is
not
important
let
him
have
his
games
and
secret
meetings
oh
i
don't
know
something
with
buffy
and
her
friends
and
why
does
he
let
her
socialize
so
much
it
hardly
seems
no
matter
would
you
like
to
do
some
training
yes
that's
the
idea
you
wanted
to
see
me
mr
giles
please
a
good
watcher
must
be
awake
and
alert
at
all
hours
god
yes
please
i'm
completely
knackered
i
spent
the
afternoon
training
with
faith
she
doesn't
lack
for
energy
if
you're
questioning
my
qualifications
well
we
must
get
to
it
immediately
hide
it
before
someone
else
finds
it
destroy
it
well
i
must
say
mr
giles
good
show
good
show
indeed
gwen
post
mr
giles
sent
me
to
help
you
destroy
the
glove
is
that
the
living
flame
look
i'm
sorry
to
be
so
abrupt
but
lagos
is
on
his
way
here
now
if
you're
performing
the
ritual
incorrectly
it
will
only
make
the
glove
more
powerful
good
where
is
the
glove
that's
what
i
love
about
this
town
everyone's
so
helpful
bugger
bugger
it
was
supposed
to
kill
you
if
you'd
been
human
it
would
have
but
i
believe
this
is
your
poison
faith
she
doesn't
know
she's
blinded
by
love
trust
me
the
glove
it's
in
the
trunk
help
faith
finally
taou
huogan
maqachte
milegaing
faith
a
word
of
advice
you're
an
idiot
tauo
freim
tauo
freim
tauo
freim
tauo
freim
there's
nothing
you
can
do
to
me
now
i
have
the
glove
with
the
glove
comes
the
power
