willow
i'll
take
her
we
should
meet
up
somewhere
doesn't
sound
like
they
found
willow
and
xander
i
think
i
think
the
woods
let
out
over
this
way
we
should
keep
off
the
streets
take
alleys
if
we
can
let's
go
willow
xander
they're
not
here
yet
they're
all
right
i
don't
know
anya
they're
not
because
he's
with
willow
and
if
something

happened
i'd
know
and
so
would
you
i'm
sure
of
it
they're
fine
they're
both
fine
maybe
they
got
lost
in
the
woods
no
it's
okay
lost
is
good
willow
and
i
always
know
how
to
find
each
other
ssh
aradia
hear
my
words
are
you
willow
uh
not
yet
but
but
i
will
be
we've
been
calling
the
house
but
xander
maybe
they're
on
their
way
here
i
mean
this
place
is
norad
and
we
are
at
defcon
one
if
we're
gonna
go
we
should
go
now
they're
just
getting
more
and
more
worked
up
by
the
moment
it
wasn't
your
fault
we
we
don't
know
if
the
spell
would
have
worked
even
if
the
demons
hadn't
willow
it
would
have
worked
well

maybe
maybe
it
wasn't
supposed
to
i
mean
those
demons
showing
up
at
the
exact
wrong
time
maybe
we
really
were
in
over
our
heads
invoking
forces
that
we
have
no
right
to
maybe
the
fates
sent
down
all
that
destruction
on
us
to
stop
us
i
mean
no
no
her
hands
are
bleeding
her
fingers
she
had
to

dig
out
of
her
own
grave
you
aren't
reaching
her
she's
too
traumatized
incindere
more
than
one
well
they
wanted
a
massacre
should
we
follow
her
nobody
messes
with
my
girl
my
first
