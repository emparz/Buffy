well
um
it's
just

we're
minus
a
buffybot
and
uh
spike
is
missing
in
action
somewhere
with
dawn
and
giles
flew
away
and
uh
well
you
you're
looking
a
little
magickedout
it's
just
how
are
we
supposed
to
fight

we
can
take
a
vampire
or
two
sure
but
there's
a
whole
cavalcade
of
demons
out
there

i
mean
i
think
this
you
know

it
it
takes
um

i
mean
i

we
need
buffy
i'm
not
saying
we
announce
it
this
second
well
i
think
it
would
please
them
to
know
we're
engaged
and
i
think
willow
in
particular
could
use
a
real
moralebooster
right
now
well
but
it's
just
all
the
excuses
for
not
telling
everyone
we're
engaged
are
gone
now
i
mean
aside
from
hell
bikers
there's
nothing
standing
in
our
way
this
is
it
no
more
surprises
it

it's
the
buffy
bot
where
is
she
what's
wrong
with
her
oh
she's
filthy
hey

some
good
news
that
might
perk
you
right
up
uh
xander
and
i
have
an
announcement
what
just
trying
to
help
plus
we
have
a
slayer
here
uh
who
might
actually
be
looking
to
eat
some
brains
so
i
think
a
little
quiet
moseying
no
hard
feelings
and
i'm
sure
your
demon
horde
won't
think
any
the
less
of
you
don't
don't
do
that
why
would
she
do
that
does
this
mean
