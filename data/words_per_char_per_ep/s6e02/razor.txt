i'll
service
ya
girl
toy
say
hello
to
your
new
home
boys
this
here
is
a
momentous
occasion
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
now
no
question
the
open
backroads
and
highways
have
been
good
to
us
but
we've
got
ourselves
a
juicy
little
burg
here
just
ripe
for
the
picking
and
i
ain't
in
no
hurry
to
leave
it
you
so
i
figure
what
better
way
to
kick
off
our

semisettlingdown
than
with
a
little
christening
a
symbolic
act
commemorating
the
new
order
around
here

and
ridding
ourselves
of
any
notsopleasant
reminders
of
the
old
all
in
one
quick
really
really
violent
fell
swoop
gentlemen
start
your
engines
byebye
slayer
another
one
for
the
fire
boys
tear
it
up
yeah
welcome
home
slayer
alive
and
kickin'
after
all
well
alive
anyway
not
looking
too
good
though
is
she
big
axe
you
got
there
ah
so
you
got
a
witch
in
the
mix
now
my
boys
see
that's
tricky
they
came
looking
for
a
massacre
and
i
think
you
got
exactly
enough
magic
between
you
for
a
kiddie
birthday
party
whoa
well
i
better
back
off
or
you
might
what
pull
a
rabbit
out
of
a
hat
of
course
we
want
trouble
we're
demons
we're
really
all
about
trouble
oh
i
get
your
point
now
let
me
tell
you
something
children
we're
not
gonna
fight
you
we're
just
gonna
hold
you
down
and
enjoy
ourselves
for
a
few
hours
you
might
even
live
through
it
except
that
certain
of
my
boys
got
some
anatomical
incompatibilities
that
uh
tend
to
tear
up
little
girls
so
who
wants
to
go
first
i
was
really
hoping
it'd
be
you
now
what
kind
of
slayer
is
it
runs
out
on
her
buddies
just
when
they
need
her
the
most
so
witch
got
a
little
power
after
all
well
let's
see
what
tricks
you
can
manage
while
i
choke
the
life
outta
suddenly
he
gasps
and
lets
willow
go
she
falls
to
the
ground
razor
falls
facefirst
beside
her
with
the
axe
buried
in
his
back
