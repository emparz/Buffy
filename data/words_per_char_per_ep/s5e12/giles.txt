uh
yes
yes
we
we're
here
for
a
reason
i've
had
some
rather
uh

well
i've
had
some
news
it
seems
that
the
council
of
watchers
has

found
some
information
that
may
help
us
out
presumably
we'll
find
that
out
when
they

arrive
could
be
very
important
um
they
well
they
can
appear
a
bit

well
uh
hardnosed
but
uh
well
essentially
their
agenda
is
the
same
as
ours
they
want
to
save
the
world
and
kill
demons
they're
probably
already
on
their
way
our
old
friend
quinton
travers
is

heading
up
the
delegation
well
that's
precisely
why
we
need
to
talk
to
them
um
just
that

if
the
council
knows
something
about
glory
her
agenda
or
her
origins
then

then
maybe
it
will
help
us
get
a
a
a
grip
on
what
we're
dealing
with
right
now
i
think
we're
we're
a
bit
lost
well
if
you're
serious
about
these
matters
all
right
but

you
need
to
be
very
careful
measure
precisely
and
and
please
don't
step
ahead
quinton
i
didn't
realize
you
were
here
been
a
while
i
see
you've
uh
brought
some
of
our

colleagues
with
you
would
you
care
to
introduce
us
well
certainly
certainly
uh
well
um
this
is
the
shop
obviously
uh
iit's
been
a
very
interesting
transition
into
the
world
of
retail
but
i
think
it's
gone
rather
well
i'll
give
you
the
grand
tour
if
you
like
yes
well
i
i
uh
do
limit
my
time
here
obviously
buffy
and
i
have
been
training
a
great
deal
these
days
uh
there's
a
a
back
room
i'm
very
careful
i'm
sorry
who
are
you
in
that
case
i
severely
underpriced
it
what
what
whawhat
is
just
for
the
duration
you
knew
you
were
gonna
do
this
before
you
even
saw
the
place
what
review
quinton
let's
just
stop
a
moment
and
talk
about
this
anya
just
go
you
don't
have
to
talk
to
him
she
works
for
me
now
tell
me
about
this
review
no
one
said
anything
to
me
about
this
you
all
stand
around
and
look
somber
good
job
you
used
to
pay
me
if
you
recall
firing
me
was
not
my
idea
i'm
not
having
you
put
her
through
another
one
of
your
insane
tests
you
can
trust
her
buffy's
come
very
far
recently
she's
acquired
a
remarkable
focus
we've
been
developing
sort
of
a
a
hybrid
fighting
style

let
me
outline
her
progress
for
you
and
ii
think
you'll
see
that
your
review
isn't
strictly
needed
they're

staying
a
little
longer
than
i'd
anticipated
well
that's
a
very
comforting
bloodless
way
of
looking
at
it
isn't
it
resisting
your
recommendations
she
fails
if
we
don't
do
whatever
you
say
how
much
under
your
thumb
do
you
think
we
are
she's
not
your
bloody
instrument
and
you
have
no
right
to
do
any
of
this
it's
a
power
play
that's
what
it
is
it's
about
who
has
the
power
i
should
have
set
you
loose
on
them
that's
what
i
should
have
done
i
suppose
not
well
i
could
i
think
i
will
in
a
heartbeat
see
the
rough
stuff
they're
all
right
out
there
a
bit
hamhanded
but
they
get
it
done
but
uh

this
stuff
the
uh
bureaucracy
the
pulling
of
political
strings
they're
the
best
in
the
world
they
can
kill
you
with
the
stroke
of
a
pen
poncy
sods
well
i
i
suppose
they'll
make
it
as
difficult
as
they
want
to
the
physical
stuff
could
be
a
bit
of
a
challenge
buffy
no
one
could
have
done
any
better
than
you
buffy
calm
down
the
scandal
here
is
not
anything
you've
done
wrong
it's
the
way
they're
behaving
holding
what
they
know
hostage
with
a
gun
pointed
at
my
bleeding
green
card
no
less
it's
humiliating
thank
you
if
you
want
her
to
attack
the
dummy
he
wants
you
to
bow
take
a
bow
punch
him
sorry
uhback
kick
elbow
elbowstrike
i've
trained
her
to
win
buffy
will
be
here
i
assure
you
was
was
there
an
attack
buffy
are
you
retroactive
quinton
well
it's
it's
not
you
know
during
working
hours
well
i
suppose
we
could
