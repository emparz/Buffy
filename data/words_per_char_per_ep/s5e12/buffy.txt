sorry
mom's
still
not
a
hundred
percent
and
i
guess
i
haven't
really
been
taking
up
the
slack
about
glory
arrive
they're
coming
here
now
wwhy
do
they
have
to
come
here
yeah
they're
scary
and
horrible
giles
i
don't
want
them
to
come
here
i
don't
trust
them
make
them
not
come
here
they
put
me
through
that
test
and
it
almost
killed
me
and
then
when
i
was
faith
they
almost
killed
me
again
honestly
i
really
can't
handle
almost
being
killed
right
now
it's
not
just
that
they're
gonna
screw
everything
up
iit's
a
delicate
time
right
now
ii
have
to
take
care
of
dawn
and
xander
but
that's
not
new
you've
always
taken
care
of
her
right
right
i
i
know
that
it's
just
you
know
there's
there's
glory
and
and
i
don't
need
the
council
looking
over
my
shoulder
when
i
don't
even
know
what
we're
dealing
with
dawn
are
you
listening
she
was
listening
no
i
i
guess
not
you
know
it's
just

sometimes
we

say
stuff
and
and

it's
all
good
giles
you
were
saying

something
nearly
impossible
i
uh
about
you
know
killing
him

you
know
they
they
poisoned
him
and
and
they
beat
him
and
they
shot
him
and
he
didn't
die
but
there
are
reported
sightings
of
him
as
late
as
the
1930s
aren't
there
there
was
also
near
consensus
about
columbus
you
know
until
someone
asked
the
vikings
what
they
were
up
to
in
the
1400s
and
they're
like
'discovering
this
americashaped
continent'
i
just

i'm
only
saying
you
know
it
might
be
interesting
if
we

came
at
it
from
you
know
a
different
perspective
that's
all
i
only
meant
professor
what
was
it
you
were
going
on
about
last
week
mysterious
sleeping
patterns
of
the
prussian
generals
now
some
of
us
are
here
to
learn
believe
it
or
not
we're
interested
in
finding
out
what
actually
happened
it's
called
studying
history
you
can
sit
down
now
unless
you
have
something
else
to
add
professor
some
of
us
are
here
to
learn
professor
maybe
you'd
like
to
teach
your
own
class
spike

why
did
you
do
that
gratitude
for
getting
in
my
way
i
was
regrouping
i
didn't
need
you
i
never
need
you
spike
you
know
what
i
don't
need
a
boyfriend
to
rescue
me
or
for
any
other
reason
you're
disgusting
you
know
what
spike
the
more
i
get
to
know
you
the
more
i
wish
i
didn't
bad
day

to
my
friends

you've
gotta
be
kidding
me
giles
you
can't
do
that
you
don't
have
that
kind
of
power
i'm
guessing
they
do
big
power
outage
in
buffy
county
giles
that
travers
guy
is
like
sixty
i
can't
hit
him
can
i
can
they
really
do
the
stuff
they
threatened
kick
you
out
the
country
am
i
gonna
be
able
to
get
through
this
review
that's
not
what
i'm
worried
about
it's
the
other
stuff
examining
decisions
i've
made
i
mean
twice
now
i've
been
within
slaying
distance
of
glory
and
twice
she's
kicked
my
ass
without
even
tensing
a
muscle
and
i
haven't
been
able
to
figure
out

what
she
is
or
anything
about
her
except
that
she
wants
the
key
which
i
have
and
i
can't
even
figure
out
if
it's
okay
for
me
to
tell
anyone
that
but
no
one
else
is
gonna
be
asked
the
questions
that
i
can't
answer
they're
gonna
expect
me
to

to
be
like
a
slayer
and
and
know
stuff
but
i'm
just
me
and
i
don't
know
anything
and
they're
gonna
go
away
and
they're
not
gonna
tell
me
how
to
fight
glory
and
i'm
not
gonna
be
able
to
protect
dawn
also
smart
they
picked
the
perfect
thing
i
can't
lose
you
i
guess
i
should
be
getting
ready
what
do
you
think
it'll
be
like
i
mean
how
do
you
think
they'll
start

a
lot
of
people
talking
at
me
the
last
few
days
everyone
just
lining
up
to
tell
me
how
unimportant
i
am

why
power
i
have
it
they

this
bothers
them
glory

to
my
home
today
you

in
you
came
to
beg
me
to
let
you
back
in
to
give
your
jobs
your
lives
some
semblance
of

i'm
fairly
certain
i

you're
watchers
without
a
slayer
you're
pretty
much
just
watchin'
masterpiece
theater
you
can't
stop
glory
you

the
information
you

it
in
the
'everyone

insaneo's
home
journal'
