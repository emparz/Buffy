one
soldier
in
a
vast
army
the
knights
of
byzantium
an
ancient
order
and
now
your
enemy
you
think
we
align
ourselves
with
the
beast
you
must
be
mad
no
we
were
fools
three
alone
but
if
it
takes
a
hundred
men
we
send
a
hundred
men
and
if
it
takes
a
thousand
we
send
a
thousand
so
long
as
you
protect
the
key
the
brotherhood
will
never
stop
until
we
destroy
it
and
you
you
are
the
slayer
and
we
know
what
we
must
do
now
be
done
with
it
kill
us
and
let
legions
follow
