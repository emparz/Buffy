that
must
have
belonged
to
uh
um
aren't
we
supposed
to
have
a
meeting
yeah
don't
they
have
phones
'allo
buffy
here's
some
stuff
we
know
pip
pip'
but
that's
not
new
you've
always
taken
care
of
her
best
friends
willow
and
me
and
buffy
the
three
of
us
have
been
together
from
the
beginning
we've
always
gone
on
patrols
and
uh
done
demon
research
with
her
and
everything
no
i
don't
have
any
powers
but
i
do
help
last
year
uh
willow
giles
and
me
combined
our
essences
with
buffy
which
isn't
as
weird
as
it
sounds
we
merged
and
i
was
the
heart
part
of
a
superbuffy
again
let
me
stress
the
notasweird
thing
yes
she's
saved
my
life
lots
of
times
the
vampires
in
this
town
hate
her
look
at
them
big
tough
council
members
pickin'
on
the
books
because
if
they
deport
him
they're
not
just
destroying
his
career
they're

condemning
the
man
to
a
lifetime
diet
of
blood
sausage
bangers
and
mash
that
was
excellent
i've
clocked
field
time
