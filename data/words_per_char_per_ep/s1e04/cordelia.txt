excuse
you
medically
prescribed
lunch
my
doctor
ships
it
daily
i'll
only
be
here
as
long
as
i
can
hold
my
breath
his
head
his
head
oh
my
god
where's
his
head
i
don't
know
what
to
say
it
was
really
i
mean
one
minute
you're
in
your
normal
life
and
then
who's
in
the
fridge
it
really
gets
to
you
a
thing
like
that
it
was
let's
just
say
i
haven't
been
able
to
eat
a
thing
since
yesterday
i
think
i
lost
like
seven
and
a
half
ounces
way
swifter
than
that
socalled
diet
that
quack
put
me
on
oh
i'm
not
saying
that
we
should
kill
a
teacher
every
day
just
so
i
can
lose
weight
i'm
just
saying
when
tragedy
strikes
we
have
to
look
on
the
bright
side
you
know
like
how
even
used
mercedes
still
have
leather
seats
