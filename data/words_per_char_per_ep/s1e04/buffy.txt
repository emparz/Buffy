major
extenuating
circumstances

uh
kinda
funny
destructo
girl

'great'
in
a
bad
way
the
homework
thing
yeah

i
don't
believe
it
well
look
who's
here
i'd
say
it's
nice
to
see
you
but
then
we
both
know
that's
a
big
fib
no
you'll
just
give
me
a
cryptic
warning
about
some
exciting
new
catastrophe
and
then
disappear
into
the
night
right
you
can
take
it
a
little
big
on
me
what
happened
to
somebody
with
a
big
fork
the
fork
guy
okay
i'll
give
you
improved
marks
for
that
one
ripping
a
throat
out
it's
a
strong
visual
it's
not
cryptic
sweet
dreams
to
you
too
that's
all
cryptic
guy
said
fork
guy
bright
sunny
beautiful
however
can
we
escape
this
torment
what
happened
is
he
sick
he's
missing
if
something's
wrong
yeah
dr
gregory
dropped
his
glasses
why
wouldn't
he
pick
them
up
do
you
know
when
he's
coming
back
well
the
words
'bugugly'
kinda
spring
to
mind
eww
hot
dog
surprise
be
still
my
heart
oh
i
understand
the
younger
man
is
too
dumb
to
wonder
why
an
older
woman
can't
find
someone
her
own
age
and
too
desperate
to
care
about
the
surgical
improvements
and
so
terribly
innocent
no
thank
you
so
did
i
count
on
it
oh
not
a
lot
um
he
was
killed
here
on
campus
i'm
guessing
the
last
day
we
saw
him
he
didn't
change
his
clothing
angel
he
warned
me
that
something
was
coming
cut
off
his
hand
and
replaced
it
with
a
fork
fork
guy
doesn't
do
heads
and
dr
gregory's
blood
wasn't
drained
we're
on
a
hellmouth
it's
a
center
of
mystical
convergence
guess
it's
the
same
thing
where
was
that
guy
killed
weatherly
park
cross
my
heart
yes
yes
i
lied
i'm
a
bad
person
let's
move
on
more
like
a
jumbo
claw
and
i
saw
something
else
something
much
more
interesting
than
your
average
runofthemill
killer
vampire
do
you
know
miss
french
the
teacher
that's
subbing
for
dr
gregory
well
i'm
chasing
claw
guy
last
night
and
miss
well
proportioned
is
heading
home
the
claw
guy
takes
one
look
at
her
and
runs
screaming
for
cover
he
was
petrified
uh
huh
so
i'm
an
undead
monster
that
can
shave
with
my
hand
how
many
things
am
i
afraid
of
so
what's
her
deal
then
i
better
get
to
class
um
you
mean
yesterday
in
the
cafeteria
when
we
found
him
well
no
i'm
gonna
be
late
for
biology
but
i
really
don't
need
but
i
really
really
don't
but
mr
flutie
i
oh
great
a
pop
quiz

i'm
not
saying

craned
her
neck

are
talking
full
on
exorcist
twist
which
reminds
me
how
come
blayne
who
worked
with
her
oneon
one
yesterday
isn't
here
today
any
luck
try
looking
under
things
that
can
turn
their
heads
all
the
way
around
no
nothing
human
there
are
some
insects
that
can
whatever
she
is
i'm
gonna
be
ready
for
her
my
homework
where
are
the
books
on
bugs
dig
this
'the
praying
mantis
can
rotate
its
head
180
degrees
while
waiting
for
its
next
meal
to
walk
by'
ha
well
c'mon
guys
ha
okay
factoid
1
only
the
praying
mantis
can
rotate
its
head
like
that
factoid
2
a
pretty
whackedout
vampire
is
scared
to
death
of
her
factoid
3
her
fashion
sense
screams
predator
exactly
entomawho
i
knew
that
okay
don't
panic
i'll
warn
him
but
i
need
you
to
hack
onto
the
coroner's
office
for
me
autopsy
on
dr
gregory
i've
been
trying
to
figures
out
these
marks
that
i
saw
on
his
corpse
i'm
thinking
they
were
teeth
and
uh
these
cuddlies
should
definitely
be
brushing
after
every
meal
and
you
were
saying
something
about
a
beast
of
course
good
idea
hey
so
how'd
it
go
with
miss
french
xander
she's
not
what
she
seems
okay
um
i'm
gonna
have
to
tell
you
something
about
her
and
i'm
gonna
need
you
to
really
listen
okay
i
don't
think
she's
human
technically
a
big
bug
this
sounds
really
weird
i'm
aware
of
that
what
i
know
i
read
all
about
it
it's
call
um
a
pheromone
it's
a
chemical
attractant
that
insects
give
off
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
wha
oh
you
hurt
your
hand
there
are
teeth
marks
which
match
perfectly
the
one
insect
that
nips
off
its
prey's
head
huh
it's
the
way
they
feed
head
first
it's
also
the
way
they
mate
the
female
bites
off
the
male's
head
while
they're
hey
hey
take
it
easy
willow
xander
is
not
in
any
immediate
danger
i
saw
him
leave
school
he's
probably
safe
at
home
right
now
it
being
giles
while
we're
young
virgins
well
xander's
not
a
uh
i
mean
he's
probably
okay
okay
so
this
thing
is
breeding
and
we
need
to
find
it
and
snuff
it
any
tips
on
the
snuffing
part
slice
and
dice
well
your
buddy
carlyle
faced
it
and
he's
still
around
okay
admiral
way
to
inspire
the
troops
see
if
you
can
get
her
address
off
the
substitute
rolls
and
you
need
to
record
bat
sonar
and
fast
bats
eat
them
the
mantis
hears
sonar
its
entire
nervous
system
goes
kaplooey
in
the
vid
library
there're
no
books
but
it's
dark
and
musty
you'll
feel
right
at
home
go
i
guess
i'll
handle
the
armory
great
giles
let's
roll
yeah
that
would
be
wrong
i'm
looking
for
miss
french
natalie
french
the
substitute
biology
teacher
i
can't
believe
this
she
used
miss
french's
records
to
get
into
the
school

saw
her
walking
past
