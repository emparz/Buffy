for
science

thank
you
blayne
my
name
is
natalie
french
and
i
will
be
substituting
for
dr
gregory

um
buffy
they
just
call
and
tell
me
where
they
want
me
excuse
me
blayne
yes
his
notes
tell
me
you
were
right
in
the
middle
of
insect
life
the
praying
mantis
is
a
fascinating
creature
forced
to
live
alone
who
can
tell
me
why
buffy
there
is
nothing
ugly
about
these
unique
creatures
the
reason
they
live
alone
is
because
they're
cannibals
oh
well
it's
hardly
their
fault
it's
the
way
nature
designed
them
noble
solitary
and
prolific
over
1800
species
worldwide
and
in
nearly
all
of
them
the
female
is
larger
and
more
aggressive
than
the
male
the
california
mantis
lays
her
eggs
and
then
finds
a
mate
to
fertilize
them
once
he's
played
his
part
she
covers
the
eggs
in
a
protective
sack
and
attaches
it
to
a
leaf
or
twig
out
of
danger
now
if
she's
done
her
job
correctly
in
a
few
months
she'll
have
several
hundred
offspring
you
know
we
should
make
some
model
egg
sacks
for
the
science
fair
