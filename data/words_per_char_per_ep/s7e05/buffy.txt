you
talked
to
her
lately
i
just
don't
want
you
to
get
your
hopes
up
strong
successful
males
say
giddy
well
i'm
not
sure
i
get
the
sad
vibe
but
there's
definitely
a
vengeance
vibe
worth
worrying
about
i
hope
you're
right
spike
i
can
help
you
it's
different
you're
different
spike
it's
me
it's
you
and
it's
me
and
we'll
get
through
this
we'll
get
through
this
spike
this
basement
is
killing
you
this
is
the
hellmouth
there
is
something
bad
down
here
possibly
everything
bad
you
have
a
soul
fine
show
me
get
up
and
get
out
of
this
basement
hello
willow
hey
is
everything—
a
spider
demon
wh—
hhold
on
aare
you
all
right
like
how
uhhuh
uhhuh
wait
ok
go
ahead
no
no
no
no
no
it's
all
good
i'll
get
xander
to
go
but
seriously
you
just—
whoa
ripped
out
the
heart
my
god
hey
did
you
get
that
physics
class
you
wanted
thanks
for
sidekicking
i
didn't
want
to
trouble
willow
figure
she's
got
enough
to
do
first
day
back
and
all
some
sort
of
spider
demony
thingy
she
had
to
go
pretty
quickly
i
think
she
had
to
sign
up
for
classes
or
something
i
don't
know
i
guess
she
was
a
little
more
nervous
than
she
was
letting
on
she
didn't
but
i
can't
imagine
she'd
send
us
out
if
it
wasn't—
the
heart
is
completely
ripped
out
this
is
our
guy
willow
said
it
was
a
spider
demon
maybe
it's
its
webbing
xander
i
can't
tell
there
is
definitely
something
moving
up
there
xander
you
ok
uhhuh
i'm
more
concerned
with
where
that
thing
came
from
if
there
are
more
of
those
spider
demons
running
around
we
need
to
know
about
it
we
should
hit
the
research
find
out
if—
how
many
xander
xander
it's
ok
she
didn't
tell
us
for
a
reason
she
didn't
tell
us
because
she
knows
what
i
have
to
do
i
have
to
kill
anya
she's
not
the
anya
that
you
knew
xander
she's
a
demon
don't
act
like
this
is
easy
for
me
you
know
it's
not
i've
considered
them
the
thought
that
it
might
come
to
this
has
occurred
to
me
before
it's
occurred
to
you
too
it's
ok
xander
i
know
this
is
hard
for
you
to
hear
but
it's
what
i
have
to
do
i
don't
want
to
it's
different
i
know
and
that's
why
you
can't
see
this
for
what
it
really
is
willow
was
different
she's
a
human
anya's
a
demon
it
is
never
simple
spike
was
harmless
he
was
helping
and
anya
did
she
chose
to
become
a
demon
twice
i
don't
care
what
she's
going
through
i
killed
angel
do
you
even
remember
that
i
would
have
given
up
everything
i
had
to
be
with—
i
loved
him
more
than
i
will
ever
love
anything
in
this
life
and
i
put
a
sword
through
his
heart
because
i
had
to
do
you
remember
cheering
me
on
both
of
you
do
you
remember
giving
me
willow's
message
kick
his
ass
it
is
always
different
it's
always
complicated
and
at
some
point
someone
has
to
draw
the
line
and
that
is
always
going
to
be
me
you
get
down
on
me
for
cutting
myself
off
but
in
the
end
the
slayer
is
always
cut
off
there's
no
mystical
guidebook
no
allknowing
council
human
rules
don't
apply
there's
only
me
i
am
the
law
then
please
find
it

out
of
my
way
