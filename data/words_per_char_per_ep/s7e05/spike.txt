i
don't
trust
what
i
see
anymore
i
don't
know
how
to
explain
it
exactly
it's
like
i've
been
seeing
things
dru
used
to
see
things
you
know
she'd
always
be
staring
up
at
the
sky
watching
cherubs
burn
or
the
heavens
bleed
or
some
nonsense
i
used
to
stare
at
her
and
think
she'd
gone
completely
sack
of
hammers
but
she'd
see
the
sky
when
we
were
inside
and
it'd
make
her
so
happy
she'd
see
showers
she'd
see
stars
now
i
see
her
i'm
in
trouble
buffy
i
could
never
ask
not
after
i
could
never
ask
never
can't
hear
you
can't
hear
you
scream
montresor
all
you
like
pet
i
don't
have
anywhere
else
to
go
