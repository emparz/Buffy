still
fluey
bummed
about
missing
the
field
trip
she
says
she
wants
you
to
meditate
extra
hard
for
her
and
to
bring
her
back
some
smores
hey
how
is
he
well
there
seems
to
be
a
definite
lack
of
screaming
that
has
to
be
good
yeah
thought
i'd
bring
her
some
tea
help
her
feel
better
it's
just
tea
spike's
chip
well
i
remember
trying
to
dig
up
stuff
back
then
but
you
know
turns
out
when
a
secret
government
agency
studies
vampires
and
puts
chips
in
their
brains
that
keep
them
from
hurting
people
they
don't
really
build
websites
why
yeah
but
he
was
under
the
control
of
the
first
the
chip
is
misfiring
all
on
its
own
then
well
this'll
be
fun
no
ok
not
when
you
make
it
sound
all
dirty
like
that
it's
just
tea
hey
i
figured
the
best
thing
for
a
cold
is
a
nice
hot
cup
of
boots
for
someone
who's
sick
you
look
surprisingly
robust
and
casual
dressy
you
were
never
sick
oh
you
are
so
busted
xander's
gonna
have
to
drive
you
to
the
desert
and—
what
this
is
a
mission
and
the
little
pink
umbrellas
are
a
signal
for
what
we're
not
on
a
mission
are
we
why
do
you
do
that
all
right
i'll
stay
for
one
drink

i'm
going
home

easy
and
you
just
assume
that
i'm—i'm
gay

much
hey
what
you
think
you
have
some
special
lesbidar
or
something
