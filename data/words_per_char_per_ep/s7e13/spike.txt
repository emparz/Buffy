a
breather
eh
from
the
constant
pitter
patter
of
clomping
teenage
girly
feet
come
on
it's
like
a
bloody
warzone
up
there
and
not
in
a
good
way
i'm
just
trying
to
stay
out
of
their
way
this
is
better
believe
me
it's
safer
with
you
by
my
side
yeah
you
won't
let
me
hurt
one
of
them
and
that's
the
way
it's
gonna
be
until
we're
sure
the
first
is
done
making
me
its
bitch
either
we're
together
or
i'm
on
the
leash
buffy
ow
ow
ow
ow
the
chip

another
blood
vessel

think

maybe
i
wasn't
meant
to
last
this
long
one
more
thing

i
have
in
common
eh
pet

gonna
be
useable
again

chip
fired
again

wanna
go
back
in
this

pretty
good
when
the
initiative
held
me
captive
here
every
time

get
a
littlerambunctious
the
chip'd
kick
in
i
feel
like

head
was
gonna
explode

dope
me
up

would
be
all
daffodils
and
teddy
bears
for
a
couple
of
hours
anyway
i'll
take
whatever
i
can
get

just
sealed
the
place
off
