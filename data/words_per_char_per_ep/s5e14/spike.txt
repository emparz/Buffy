bleedin'
crime
is
what
it
is
jackin'
up
the
bar
price
to
pay
for
fixin'
up
this
sinkhole
not
my
fault
insurance
doesn't
cover
act
of
troll
i've
half
a
mind
to
especially
since
the
flowering
onion
got
remodeled
off
the
sodding
menu
's
the
only
thing
this
place
had
going
for
it
wha
what
do
you
mean
what
am

i

well
i
saw
you

sitting
here
alone
thought
i
don't
know
you
could
maybe
do
with
a
bit
of
uh
you
know
company
suit
yourself
although
it's
just
we
took
on
that
glory
chippie
together
i
was
right
there
with
you
fightin'
the
fight
still
points
for
intent
you'd
think
that
would
be
enough
to
cut
me
a
sliver
of
slack
earn
a
little
consideration
respect
bugger
it
and
you're
saying
i
didn't
and
you're
making
it
into
very
hard
work
yeah
like
you
could
ever
hurt
me
i'm
not
tired
harm

really
not
in
the
mood
right
now
like
what
you
stop
yammering
for
two
seconds
oh
it's
you
what
are
you
doing
here
lurking
about
nothing
no
why
are
you
does
buffy
know
you're
here
go
home
then
well
you
can't
bloody
well
stay
here
because
i've
got
things
to
do
bad
evil
things
that
are
not
for
a
child's
eyes
yeah
well
originally
i
was
i
got
over
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
it
matters
very
much
how
you
start
out
they're
just
trying
to
keep
you
safe
i
expect
take
that
back
she
does
is
that
right
so
um
what
else
does
buffy
say
about
me
well
i
had
hubby
by
the
throat
didn't
i
promised
her
he'd
live
if
she
gave
me
the
invite
what
do
you
think
too
much
for
you
and
i
kill
'em
right
quick
the
whole
lot
but
there's
someone
missing
supposed
to
be

this
little
girl
so
i
get
real
quiet
and
i
hear
this
tiny
noise
coming
from
the
coal
bin
this
little
sigh
so
i
listened
harder
it's
very
very
quiet
oh

bloody
hell
right
yeah
so
uh
i
knew
the
girl
was
in
the
coal
bin
so
i
rip
it
open
very
violent
haul
her
out
of
there

and
then
i
give
her
to
a
good
family
in
a
nice
home
where
they're
never
ever
mean
to
her
and
didn't
lock
her
in
the
coal
bin
i
was
just
about
to
send
her
home
i
knew
you'd
be
frettin'
that's
funny
and
really
how
many
do
you
need
amphorae
i
got
a
bit
of
info
you
might
be
keen
on
knowin'
i
got
a
bead
on
the
guy
who
killed
those
people
the
ones
on
the
train
i'll
do
better
than
that
i'll
show
what's
the
matter

vamps
holed
up
in
a
warehouse
downtown

pointy
sticks

the
ramones
well
that
was
sad
i'm
embarrassed
for
our
kind
so
should
we
chase
after
'em

they
couldn't
have
gone
far
so

you're
saying
they're
a
couple
of
poofters

you
can't
deny
it
there's
something
between

heat
desire
angel
was
a
vampire
and
i
can
be
too
i've
changed

i
can't
stop
thinking
about
you
and
if
that
means
turning
my
back
on
the
whole
evil
thing
buffy
you
don't
know
what
you
mean
you
don't
know
what
feelings
are
i
damn
well
do
i
lie
awake
every
night
yeah
but

you
are
missing
the
point
this
is
real
here
i

working
on
turning
angel

bad
self

got
you
what
all
nostalgic
now

it
to
los
angeles
i've
done
the
whole
la
scene
dru

agree
with
me
besides
i've
got
a
sweet
little
setup
here
in
sunnyd
decent
digs
not
to
mention
all
the
tasty
townies
i
can
eat
right
so
you've
heard
poor
spike's
become
a
cautionary
tale
for
vampires
right
'you
better
be
good
kiddies
or
else
they
might
wire
you
up
someday'
yeah
but
the
pain

love
you
don't
understand
it's

it's
searing
it's
um
blinding
oh
bloody
hell
harm
harm
you
moron
this
is
drusilla
harm
it's
been
fun
while
it
lasted
harm
but
i
think
it'd
be
best
now
if
you
hit
the
road
no
because
i
am
see
anything
interesting
you
remember
my
ex
don't
you
slayer
come
back
she
did
couldn't
live
without
me
i'm
through
playing
bloody
well
through
playing
there
she
is
beginning
to
think
you'd
sleep
the
night
away
sorry
pet
my
house
my
rules
simple
i'm
gonna
prove
something
i
love
you
no
look
at
me
i

love
you
you're
all
i
bloody
think
about
dream
about
you're
in
my
gut

my
throat

i'm
drowning
in
you
summers
i'm
drowning
in
you
i
can
do
without
the
laugh
track
dru
you
can't
tell
me
that
there
isn't
anything
there
between
you
and
me
i
know
you
feel
something
you
still
don't
believe
still
don't
think
i
mean
it
you
want
proof
huh
how's
this
i'm
gonna
kill
drusilla
for
you
don't
mock
this
this
is
drusilla
girl
you
have
the
slightest
idea
what
she
means
to
me
it's
the
face
of
my
salvation
she
delivered
me
from
mediocrity
for
over
a
century
we

cut
a
swath
through
continents
a
hundred
years
she
never
stopped
surprising
me
never
stopped
taking
me
to
new
depths
i
was
a
lucky
bloke
just
to
touch
such
a
black
beauty
so
you
see
it
means
something
here's
why
if
you
don't
admit

that
there's
something
there

some
tiny
feeling
for
me

then
i'll
untie
dru
let
her
kill
you
instead
just

give
me
something

a
crumb

a
barest
smidgen

tell
me

maybe
someday
there's
a
chance
oh
what
ohh
gaaah
what
the
bleeding
hell
is
wrong
with
you
bloody
women
what
the
hell
does
it
take
why

do
you
bitches
torture
me
look
i
i'm
at
the
end
of
my
bleeding
tether
you
know
i
don't
even
know
why
i
even
bother
you
know
this
is
your
fault
you're
the
one
to
blame
for
all
this
bloody
right
you
are
if
you
hadn't
left
me
for
that
chaos
demon
i
never
would
have
come
back
here
never
would
have
had
this
sodding
chip
in
my
skull
and
you

wouldn't
be
able
to
touch
me
because
this
with
you
is
wrong
i
know
it
i'm
not
a
complete
idiot
you
think
i
like
having
you
in
here
destroying
everything
that
was
me
until
all
that's
left
is
you
in
a
dead
shell
you
say
you
hate
it
but
you
won't
leave
you
know
what
i
should
just
do
is
get
rid
of
both
of
you
burn
you
cut
you
into
little
pieces
so
there
won't
be
any
more
bints
to
cock
up
things
for
spi
he
suddenly
stops
talking
and
spins
around
falls
over
as
we
see
an
arrow
protruding
from
his
back
and
harmony
standing
behind
him
with
a
crossbow
oh
great
oh
so
now
you're
all
ganging
up
buffy
come
on
now
stop
you
can't
just
walk
away
from
this
so
we
had
a
fight
it's
not
our
first
love
and
it
doesn't
change
anything
no
it's
not
that
easy
we
have
something
buffy
it's
not
pretty
but
it's
real
and
there's
nothing
either
one
of
us
can
do
about
it
like
it
or
not
i'm
in
your
life
you
can't
just
shut
me
out
