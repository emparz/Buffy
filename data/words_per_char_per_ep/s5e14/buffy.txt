i
always
knew
that
he
had
this

weird
fixation
with
me
there's
nothing

let's
go
and
he
just
decided
to

hang
out
for
a
while
what
about
sorry

out
of
cash
why
don't
you
hit
on
giles

hit
up
giles

for
the
money
why

y
these
vamps

a
while
they've
nested

had
nothing
to
do
with
last
night's
murders
whoever
did
it
only
arrived
in
town
last
night
looks
like
you've
wasted
my
time
what
are
you
doing
what
is
this
what

is
this
the
latenight
stakeout
the
bogus
suspects
the
flask
is
this
a
date
oh
my
god
oh

oh
no
are
you
out
of
your
mind
no
no
no
feelings
do
not
develop
no
feelings
loathing
disgust
please
spike
you're
a
vampire
angel
was
good
what
that
chip
in
your
head
that's
not
change
thathat's
just

holding
you
back
you're
like
a
serial
killer
in
prison
uhh
uhh
you
don't
know
what
you
mean
you
don't
know
what
feelings
are
you
sleep
during
the
day
don't
don't
say
it
i'm
going
she
starts
to
walk
toward
the
door
again
we
don't
need
to
do
anything
okay
there
is
no
we
understand
well
ii
didn't
let
him
get
that
far
but

i
could
see
the
words
coming
well
i

i
do
beat
him
up
a
lot
for
spike
that's
like
third
base
not
really
as
long
as
it's
still
chips
ahoy
in
spike's
head
he
can't
hurt
me
or
any
of
us
you
know
besides
this'll
probably
just
blow
over
you
know
it's
just
some
weird
spike
thing
he'll
have
the
hots
for
some
gak
demon
before
we
know
it
pretty
twisted
yeah
i
i
think
so
i
don't
know
i
i
was
just
so
thrown
what
no
no
no
no
i
have
to
avoid
him
again
the
bud
nips
me
thanks
but

i
think
this
is
something
i
have
to
do
myself
besides
you
know
maybe
i'm
wrong
maybe
this
this
whole
thing's
just
been
blown
way
out
of
proportion
and

he's
already
gone
back
to
wanting
me
dead
you
know
what
though
there
is
one
thing
you
can
do
for
me
while
i'm
gone
spike

are
you
here
spike
spike
i
uh

what

what
happened
dru

drusilla
what's
going
on
oh
my
god
it's
called
revulsion
and
whatever
you
think
you're
feeling
it's
not
love
you
can't
love
without
a
soul
that
doesn't
prove
anything

except
that
you're
a
sick
miserable
vampire
that
i
should
have
dusted
a
long
time
ago
and
hey
already
there
go
mock
yourself
not
to
me
kill
her
why
do
i
care
spike
the
only
chance
you
had
with
me
was
when
i
was
unconscious
which
question
do
you
want
me
to
answer
first
what
part
of
punching
you
in
the
face
do
you
not
understand
it
changes
everything
spike
i
want
you
out
i
want
you
out
of
this
town
i
want
you
off
this
planet
