you
you
bad
evil
vampire
and
i'm
gonna
slay
you
i'm
sneaking
up
and
i'm
going
to
stake
you
so
much
with
my
slaying

because
i'm
the
chosen
oh

our
little
sex
game

just
the
beginning
now
you've
gone
and
picked
up
some
cheap
queen
of
the
damned
to
dress
up
like
your
precious
droodzilla
you'd
better
not
be
thinking
what
i
think
you're
thinking
'cause
my
answer
is
the
same
as
always
no
threesomes

time
after
breaking
my
sweet
booboo's
heart

you
have
any
idea
how
hard
it's
been
to
break
down
the
walls
he
put
up
after
you
left
i
mean
serious
trust
issues
so
it's
no
use
you
crawling
back
to
him
'cause

that
game
any
more
morticia

back
what
about
me
spike
you
forget
about
me
again
the
actual
girlfriend
i
gave
you
the
best

bunch
of
months
of
my
life
i
thought
i
could
change
you
spike
i
thought
maybe
if
i
gave
and
i
gave
and
gave
maybe
you'd
come
around
maybe
be
a
little
nicer
stop
treating
me
like
your
dog
but
now
i
see
it's
you
you're
the
dog
who
needs
to
be
put
d
ow
you're
on
my
hair
oh
spikey
and
you
can
say
goodbye
to
this
because
you're
not
gonna
see
it
any
more
ever
unless
you
run
into
me
somewhere
and
it's
me
walking
away
from
you
but
even
then

i'll
probably
just

you
know

back
away
