that
book
full
of
zippy
dates
and
zesty
names
who
are
you
lately
give
it
up
and
watch
the
movie
just
relax
oh

sorry
i
got
caught
up
in
the
action
hey
buff
maybe
you
oughta
leave
the
work
behind
sometimes
you're
not
always
on
slayer
duty
you
know
really
i
will
uh
no
riley
finn
this
is
xander
uh
we
uh

we
like
the
ceiling
fan
that
thing's
pretty
heavy
owning
this
place
does
seem
kinda
dangerous
what
he
mentioned
buffy
where
do
we
find
him
and
how
hard
can
i
kill
him
people
say
they're
recycling
they're
not
recycling
what
are
you
doing
here
spike
take
cover
hey
you
okay
easy
easy
he
disappeared
that
had
to
hurt
right
it'll
be
good
yeah
when
the
imposter's
killed
the
body'll
probably
turn
back
into
whatever
it
really
is
and
then
we'll
know
so
you're
thinking
we
split
up
we
already
know
we're
on
our
way
he
came
to
us
too
buffy
our
xander
did
he
seem
a
little
but
which
one's
the
real
one
i
still
don't
get
the
original
plan
i
mean
why
do
it
the
slayer
half
would
be
like
slayer
concentrate
pretty
unkillable
we're
pushing
70
no
yes
i
do
you
wanted
to
know
if
i
wished
you
got
hit
by
the
ferulagemina
got
split
in
two
hey
i
have
buffy
buffy
being
the
slayer's
part
of
who
you
are
you
keep
thinking
i
don't
get
that
but
buffy
if
you
led
a
perfectly
normal
life
you
wouldn't
be
half
as
crazy
as
you
are
i
gotta
have
that
i
gotta
have
it
all
i'm
talkin'
toes
elbows
the
whole
badiceskatingmovie
obsession
everything
there's
no
part
of
you
i'm
not
in
love
with
you
own
a
gun
wild
we
can
prove
that
you're
both
xander
um
well
there
has
to
be
a
way
i
don't
think
that's
gonna
do
it
different
properties
went
into
each
of
you
but
you're
both
xander
psychologically
this
is
fascinating
doesn't
it
make
everyone
wanna
lock
them
in
separate
rooms
and
do
experiments
on
them
just
me
then
getting
nostalgic
you
two
have
your
friction
but

she
digs
the
whole
package
it's
obvious
hey
i'm
well
aware
of
how
lucky
i
am
like
lottery
lucky
buffy's
like
nobody
else
in
the
world
when
i'm
with
her
it's
like

it's
like
i'm
split
in
two
half
of
me
is
just

on
fire
going
crazy
if
i'm
not
touching
her
the
other
half

is
so
still
and
peaceful

just
perfectly
content
just
knows
this
is
the
one
but
she
doesn't
love
me
uh
you
can
help
me
pack
this
