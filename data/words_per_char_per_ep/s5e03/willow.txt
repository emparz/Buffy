kind
of
old
south

oofdar
goddess
of

startled
some
good
demons

this
one
see
if
your
guy's
in
here
some
demon
rituals
involve
anointing
with
oils
was
it
sort
of

sandalwoody
i
found
a
spell
so
you
can't
smell
anything
but
it
does
it
by
taking
your
nose
off
so

no
very
pretty
buffy
he's
gone
um

okay
xander

stop
dancing
xander
shut
up
why
wouldn't
i
think
you
were
xander
what's
goin'
on
xander
the
basement
isn't
a
dump
it
it's
more
like
a
really
nice
hovel
nuh
uh
we
walked
you
home
last
night
remember
shiny
things
what
are
you
talking
about
uh

toth
well
we're
working
on
it
there
has
to
be
a
way
to
get
to
buffy
to

unhypnotize
her
i'll
find
a
spell
to
snap
her
out
of
it
xander
you
sound
a
little

you
have
to
help
me
figure
this
out
you
know
that's
not
true
sometimes
we
all
helped
save
you
and
sometimes
you're
not
in
trouble
like
what
xander
no
you're
just
tired
and

and
all
soggy
that's
why
it
seems
so
hard
but
you
can't
let
him
just
take
your
whole
existence
you
think
he's
after
her
really
xander
you
already
knew
he
was
taking
over
your
life
and

you
didn't
think
about
anya
till
just
now
i
handled
it
fine
buffy
toth
looks
like
xander
he
came
to
me
ii
mean
xander
did
and
he's
in
terrible
shape
we
need
to
help
him
no
we
each
had
a
xander
i
mean

you
didn't
have
a
xander
you
had
a
a
demon
in
a
xander
suit
he
knew
stuff
he
he
did
the
snoopy
dance
buffy

was
xander

one
of
them
a
robot

all
double
this
zit
and
this

kinda
funny
dippy
thing
aand
this
weird
little
hair
that
grows
in
the
wrong
way
check
candles
and
pretense
we're
ready
we
should
do
it
now
actually
it's
not
that
hard
your
natural
state
is
to
be
together
toth's
spell
is
doing
all
the
work
of
keeping
you
apart
i
just
have
to
break
it
so
you
two

stand
right
here
side
by
side
we
don't
want
you
to
end
up
with
two
fronts
now
do
we
here
we
go
brace
yourselves
let
the
spell
be
ended
