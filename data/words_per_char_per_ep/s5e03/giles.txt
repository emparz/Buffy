miscellaneous
curses
brilliant
be
lucky
if
i
don't
curse
my
hands
off
at
the
wrist
oh
rabbit's
foot
no
wait
like
this

and
this

and
this
well
hurt
uh

maybe
not

hurt
uh
yes
yes
i'd
imagine
it
gave
him
uh
rather
a
turn
um
sort
of
more

uh

turned
and
swept
out
majestically
i
suppose
he
said
i
didn't
concern
him
well
i'm
not
dead
or
unconscious
so
i
say
bravo
for
me
toth
no
toth
is
the
name
of
the
demon
be
careful
with
that
ancient
demon
very
strong
last
survivor
of
the
tothric
clan
it
also
says
that
for
a
demon
he's
unusually
sophisticated
they're
referring
to
the
fact
that
he
does
not
fight
barehanded
he
uses
tools
devices
oh
he's
also
supposed
to
be
very
focused
and
since
he
mentioned
the
slayer
i
think
we
know
what
the
focus
is
well
there's
no
mention
of
the
types
of
places
he
might
frequent
but

i
have
an
idea
he
had
a
very
specific
olfactory
presence
um

not
even
remotely
but
he
was
very
um
distinctive
spike
um

we're
looking
for
a
demon
um
tall
robed
skin
sort
of
hanging
off
deep
voice
take
it
slowly
what's
intriguing
me
is
that
there
are
any
number
of
demons
with
the
ability
to
mimic
a
simple
form
but
uh

this
sounds
like
more
than
that
yes

i
suppose
yes
yes
it
makes
sense
a
shapeshifting
device
i
swear
this
time
i
know
i
had
that
locked
oh
dear
lord
i
said
oh
dear
lord
well
it's
always
important
neither
xander
is
a
demon
what
no
um
uh
the
rod
device
it's
called
a
ferulagemina
it
splits
one
person
in
half
distilling
personality
traits
into
two
separate
bodies
as
near
as
i
can
tell
toth
was
attempting
to
split
the
slayer
into
two
different
entities
yes
one
with
all
the
qualities
inherent
in
buffy
summers
and
the
other
one
with
everything
that
belongs
to
the
slayer
alone

the
uh
thethe
strength
the
uh
speed
the
heritage
and
when
it
hit
xander
i
think
it
separated
him
into
his
strongest
points
and
his
weakest
they're
both
real
they're
both
xander
neither
one
of
them
is
evil
there's
nothing
in
either
of
them
that
our
xander
doesn't
already
possess
but
the
two
halves
can't
exist
without
each
other
kill
the
weaker
buffy
half
and
the
slayer
half
dies
uh
uh
we
just
need
to
light
the
candles
also
we
should
continue
to
pretend
we
heard
none
of
the
disturbing
sex
talk
yes
he's
clearly
a
bad
influence
on
himself
