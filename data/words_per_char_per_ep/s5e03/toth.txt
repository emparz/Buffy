the
last
step
in
thy
forging
is
my
pain

the
price
with
which
i
purchase

the
death
of
the
slayer
the
slayer
is
not
here
that
is
a
fertility
god
feeble
man
you
are
not
going
to
distract
me
giles
hits
him
in
the
head
with
the
statue
he
reels
backward
giles
hits
him
with
the
statue
a
few
more
times
then
toth
shoves
giles
and
he
falls
into
a
pile
of
boxes
you
are
not
the
slayer
you
do
not
concern
me
i
will
not
miss
again
slayer
