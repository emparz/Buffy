harris
right
yeah
right
i'll

be
right
there
huh
i'm
not
sure
i
guess
yeah
that
would
be
great
i
already
have
an
idea
how
right
there
comes
a
point
where
you
either
have
to
move
on
or
just
buy
yourself
a
klingon
costume
and

go
with
it
thank
you
anya
you
there

look
i
know
you're
still
mad
but

i
figure
you're
probably
sitting
there
pretending
you're
not
home
but
listening
anyway
look
i
have
something
to
show
you
meet
me
at
the
apartment
you
know
the
one
nine
o'clock
no
no
he
looked
exactly
like
me
it
stole
my
face
we
have
to
find
it
and
we
have
to
kill
it
hold
up
do
we
really
have
to
figure
out
what
it
is
let's
just
go
kill
it
toth
it
does
make
sense
it
must
be
toth
should
i
go
with
you
i

told
anya
to
meet
me
at
my
new
place
i'd
feel
a
whole
lot
better
knowing
she's
safe
from
this
creep
good
thinking
when
you
kill
this
thing
you
better
make
sure
you
got
the
one's
who's
actually
cut
back
to
willow's
meet
me
at
the
apartment
you
know
the
one
900
no
trust
me
i
really
did
and
do
you
know
why
no
it's
because
i
knew
you
wanted
it
it's
all
for
you
anya
you
didn't
see
me
today
did
you
i
mean
we
didn't
talk
good
well
at
some
point
we
take
off
our
clothes
a
car
what
are
you
talking
about
there's
no
hurry
fifty
years
what
is
thi
oh
wait
a
minute
this
is
about
this
you
haven't
been
hurt
like
this
since
you
became
human
maybe
it's
finally
hitting
you
what
being
human
means
yes
i
think
it
is
you
were
gonna
live
for
thousands
of
years
and
now
you're
gonna
age
and
die
that
must
be
terrifying
being
suddenly
human
i
think
i
can
get
what
that
would
be
like
and
we
can
get
through
it
together
no
i
can't
promise
that
but
it
doesn't
sound
terrible
and
that's
saying
something
i
promise
you
anya
very
soon
you
won't
be
thinking
about
getting
older
get
out
you
don't
belong
here
it's
a
demon
he
stole
my
face
he's
trying
to
trick
you
anya
you
know
i'm
me
right
don't
worry
anya
i'll
get
rid
of
this
thing
