it
crapped
out
on
us
though
yeah
they're
gonna
look
like
mortally
wounded
easter
baskets
aw
come
on
what
does
it
really
matter
giles
knows
his
single
malt
antiseptics
yup
many
of
these
girls
will
die
slaughterhouse
is
what
it
is
ohtrying
to
talk
will
just
kill
you
sooner
yeah
well
i
could
use
a
cookie
but
i'm
not
making
reckless
wishes
you
are
i
am
ok
i'll
get
kennedy
to
watch
the
girls
she's
tough
imminent
death
won't
bother
her
they'd
only
be
useful
if
something
big
was
attacking
and
then
we
could
shove
one
down
their
throat
and
blow
'em
up
like
roy
scheider
did
with
that
shark
in
jaws
what
i've
often
thought
so
wanna
rob
oh
show
me
show
me
the
box
full
of
ointments
you
little
freak
and
get
cotton
packing
for
the
big
wounds
yeah
yeah
i
did
once
before
wellthere
was
this
other
apocalypse
this
one
time
and
well
i
took
off
but
this
time
i
don'ti
don't
know
welli
guess
i
waskinda
new
to
bein'
around
humans
before
but
now
i've
seen
a
lot
more
gotten
to
know
people
seen
what
they're
capable
of
and
i
guess
i
just
realizedhow
amazingly
screwedup
they
all
are
i
mean
really
really
screwedup
in
a
monumental
fashion
and
they
have
no
purpose
that
unites
them
so
they
just
drift
around
blundering
through
life
until
they
diewhich
theythey
know
is
coming
yet
every
single
one
of
them
is
surprised
when
it
happens
to
them
they're
incapable
of
thinking
about
what
they
want
beyond
the
moment
they
kill
each
other
which
is
clearly
insane
and
yet
here's
the
thing
when
it's
something
that
really
matters
they
fight
i
mean
they're
lame
morons
for
fighting
but
they
do
they
never
never
quit
so
i
guess
i
will
keep
fighting
too
i
do
not
stop
it
i
don't
love
them
and
i'll
kill
you
if
you
tell
anybody
i
don't
know
you
might
survive
yeah
