mission
found
the
holy
grail

the
holy
hand
grenade
or
whatever
the
hell
that
is
well
pointy
and
wooden
is
not
exactly
the
look
i
wanna
know
better
but
it
does
have
flair
can
see
why
a
girl
would
ditch
a
fella
for
one
of
these
it
doesn't
matter
you're
back
in
the
bosom
all's
forgiven
and
uh

nightwas
just
a
glitch
a
bit
of
cold
comfort
from
the
cellar
dweller

don't
make
a
thing
out
of
it
oh

another
solo
mission

don't
have
to
get
shirty
about
it
all
right
all
right
big
secret
mission
it's
fine
and
that's
the
thing
the
preacher
man
was
so
anxious
to
keep
out
of
your
mitts
well
maybe
i'll
swing
by
the
vineyard
when
you
go
make
sure
