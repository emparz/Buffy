yeah
you
want
it
i
know
you're
backing
away
get
the
wounded
we're
leaving
there's
always
more
let's
move
will
come
here
she's
losing
a
lot
of
blood
the
room
upstairs
is
ready
for
her
i'll
be
up
in
a
second
yeah
i
don't
know
i
took
it
from
caleb
it
might
be
important
what
you
guys
it
was
a
trap
it's
not
her
fault
that
could've
just
as
easily
happened
to
me
i
don't
know
i
guess
i'm
not
leaving
yeah
there's
a
plan
get
ready
time's
up
we've
still
got
work
to
do
i
think
it's
maybe
some
kind
of
scythe
the
only
thing
i
know
for
sure
is
it
made
caleb
back
off
in
a
hurry
kills
strong
bodies
3
ways
not
much
but
it's
strong
and
i
knew
it
belonged
to
me
i
just
knew
it
yeah
i
figured
that
one
out
when
i
king
arthured
it
out
of
the
stone
well
the
good
guys
are
not
traditionally
known
for
their
communication
skills
the
first's
guys
clearly
wanted
it
out
of
that
stone
it's
not
just
a
tool
it's
important
we
need
to
find
out
whatever
we
can
who
made
it
when
why
does
it
have
a
name
i
don't
know
a
credit
report
just
find
out
fast
good
because
right
now
that
thing's
all
we've
got
going
for
us
you
got
it
you
know
it's
for
the
good
of
course
i'm
not
putting
you
out
to
pasture
what
does
that
even
mean
i'm
not
i
know
that's
why
i
need
you
to
do
this
xander
i
need
someone
that
i
can
count
on
no
matter
what
happens
hey
thanks
a
lot
i
know
what
you
meant
you
will
be
you're
my
strength
xander
you're
the
reason
i
made
it
this
far
i
trust
you
with
my
life
that's
why
i
need
you
to
do
this
for
me
also
you
can't
shoot
a
bow
and
arrow
anymore
and
every
time
you
pick
up
a
sword
i
worry
that
you're
gonna
break
one
of
our
good
lamps
don't
look
at
me
you're
the
one
who
said
i'm
gonna
die
yeah
ok
sure
i
know
it
belongs
to
the
slayer
i
honestly
don't
know
does
it
matter
it
wasn't
your
fault
you're
not
you
didn't
blow
it
people
die
you
lead
them
into
battle
they're
gonna
die
it
doesn't
matter
how
ready
you
are
or
how
smart
you
are
war
is
about
death
needless
stupid
death
that's
the
funny
part
did
i
miss
something
sorry
sorry
go
principal
wood
and
you
and
in
my—
no
no
no
no
we're
just
good
friends
or
mortal
enemies
depending
on
which
day
of
the—
yeah
i
love
my
friends
i'm
very
grateful
for
them
but
that's
the
price
being
a
slayer
also
you
went
evil
and
were
killing
people
but
you're
right
i
mean
i
i
guess
everyone's
alone
but
being
a
slayer
there's
a
burden
we
can't
share
takes
the
edge
off
mmhmm
yeah
right
now
we're
going
with
scythe
you
like
i'm
sorry
about
that
great
i
have
work
to
do
yeah
it
is
i'm
not
shirty
and
what
is
shirty
that's
not
even
a
word
it's
not
a
secret
well
i
mean
it
is
but
that's
the
point
of
the
mission
find
out
the
secret
this
thing
was
forged
by—
i
don't
even
know
i
mean
something
about
a
tomb
on
unconsecrated
ground
that's
what
i
have
to
do
i
need
to
find
out
what
this
is
and
why
i
have
it
that
it
is
great
you're
a
dope
you're
a
dope
and
a
bonehead
and
you're
shirty
do
you
see
this
this
may
actually
help
me
fight
my
war
this
might
be
the
key
to
everything
and
the
reason
i'm
holding
it
is
because
of
you
because
of
the
strength
that
you
gave
me
last
night
look
i
am
tired
of
defensiveness
and
weird
mixed
signals
you
know
i
have
faith
for
that
let's
just
get
to
the
truth
here
ok
i
don't
know
how
you
felt
about
last
night
but
i
will
not—
of
what
spike
i
just
told
you
it
did
you
don't
have
to
be
i
was
i
don't
know
does
it
have
to
mean
something
maybe
when
ok
spike
we'll
go
be
heroes
who
are
you
so
what
are
you
some
kind
of
ghost
what
is
it
buffy
yeah
met
those
guys
didn't
really
care
too
much
for
'em
oh
so
you're
like
what
are
you
hence
the
luxor
casino
theme
i
don't
understand
how
is
it
possible
that
we
didn't
know
any
of
this
does
this
mean
i
can
win
yeah
oh
angel
you
look
timely
and
also
good
really
kinda
is
see
under
control
