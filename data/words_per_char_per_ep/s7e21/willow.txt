it
just
took
us
to
an
empty
house
she
must
have
moved
on
already
we
have
to
go
to
her
got
it
so
it's
true
scythe
matters
and
you
say
you
sense
something
when
you
hold
it
so
maybe
it's
like
some
kind
of
traditional
slayer
weapon
yeah
don't
worry
buff
we'll
find
out
everything
there
is
to
know
ok
before
the
vineyard
was
just
you
know
a
vineyard
it
was
a
monastery
could've
been
put
there
then
some
creepy
monks
messing
with
powers
they
don't
understand
ok
well
i
found
reference
to
stories
the
monks
used
to
tell
about
something
older
uh
like
some
kind
of
pagan
temple
no
i
don't
know
ugh
ok
maybe
we're
just
going
about
this
the
wrong
way
maybe
we
should
research
the
weapon
itself
likelook
maybe
it's
the
axe
of
dekeron
said
to
have
been
forged
in
hell
itself
lost
since
the
children's
crusade
where
it
was
said
to
have
killedâ€”
oh
children
i
hope
that's
not
it
gotta
say
no
must
be
a
slayer
thing
maybe
but
i
mean
if
caleb
is
scared
of
this
thing
it
must
be
pretty
dangerous
and
tapping
into
that
if
i
tried
something
big
i'd
change
and
then
it's
all
black
hair
and
veins
and
lightning
bolts
i
can
hardly
do
a
locator
spell
without
getting
dark
roots
honestly
i
don't
know
i
guess
so
ugh
man
none
of
these
sound
right
i
mean
look
here's
one
that's
just
m
question
mark
what
the
heck
is
that
a
whoey
yes
absolutely
carvings
like
you'd
have
on
a
pagan
temple
