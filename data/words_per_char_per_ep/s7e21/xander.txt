no
guess
so
i
hope
we're
in
time
careful
is
she
breathing
ok
wait
i'm
not
to
the
got
it
place
yet
i'm
still
in
the
neighborhood
of
you've
gotta
be
kidding
i
don't
buffy
do
you
get
that
if
i
do
this
that's
it
for
me
for
this
fight
i
feel
like
you're
putting
me
out
to
pasture
well
you
know
it's
like
uh
when
a
cow
gets
old
and
loses
an
eye
or
its
ability
to
be
milked
the
farmer
takes
it
and
puts
it
in
a
different
pasture
so
it
won't
have
to
fightwith
the
priests
look
i
don't
need
you
to
protect
me
i
got
hurt
but
i'm
not
done
i
can
still
fight
i
just
always
thought
that
i
would
i
would
be
there
with
you
you
know
for
the
end
well
not
that
this
is
the
end
no
no
no
by
the
end
i
meant
uh
a
heroic
uplifting
way
see
i'm
still
optimistic
you're
just
thrown
off
a
little
by
this
grittylooking
eye
patch
i
should
be
at
your
side
that's
all
i'm
saying
ok
hey—
i
never
said
you
were
gonna
die
i—i
implied
that
you
were
gonna
die
it's
totally
different
besides
if
you
die
i'll
just
bring
you
back
to
life
that's
what
i
do
hey
did
you
know
i
have
to
take
a
driving
test
every
year
now
no
because
of
my
eye
it's
a
whole
state
law
they
don't
trust
my
depth
perception
anymore
and
you
know
what's
even
worse
all
the
stupid
it's
all
fun
and
games
until
someone
loses
an
eye
jokes
hey
xander
so
no
more
fun
and
games
huh
that's
not
the
point
it's
an
obvious
joke
it'd
be
like
someone
calling
me
a
cyclops
i
mean
uh
give
me
some
eye
of
the
beholder
jokes
you
know
or
uh
some
eye
for
an
eye
jokes
or
maybe
even
a
postmodern
i
claudius
joke
you
know
it's
about
standards
dawnie
sighs
just
uh
be
creative
hey
dawn
dawn
you
awake
um
i
thought
you
might
say
that
it
was
chloroform
chloroform
are
you
still
loopy
away
just
open
it
