a

voice
speaks
spike
looks
nervous
but
covers
it
we
see
a
demon
in
the
darkness
but
all
we
can
see
is
an
indistinct
shape
and
a
pair
of
green
glowing
eyes

willow
comes
to
a
small
clearing
looks
around
smiles
a
little
suddenly
something
hits
her
she
falls
down
facefirst
we
see
warren
standing
behind
her
a
longhandled
axe
is
buried
in
willow's
back
warren
stares
down
at
her
looking
nervous
blackout
open
on
the
same
scene
warren
stands
over
willow
still
nervous
but
starting
to
smile
a
little
suddenly
willow
rises
upward
and
onto
her
feet
lifted
by
magic
she
turns
to
face
warren
reaching
her
arm
behind
her
to
pull
the
axe
out
of
her
back
warren
stares
at
her
fearfully
she
tosses
the
axe
to
the
ground
warren
runs
off
willow
follows
warren
runs
through
the
forest
panting
reaching
behind
him
to
pull
something
out
of
his
backpack
it's
a
small
metal
box
warren
stops
running
and
pulls
a
pin
on
the
side
of
the
box
little
metal
wings
appear
from
holes
on
two
sides
of
the
box
the
wings
begin
to
flap
warren
smiles
as
the
box
lifts
off
his
hand
and
up
into
the
air
it
zooms
away
with
quick
flitting
movements
like
a
bat
but
the
explosion
instead
of
moving
continuously
outward
only
expands
to
a
diameter
of
about
ten
feet
it
surrounds
willow
in
a
shimmering
ball
of
energy
like
solidified
air
and
fire
holding
her
motionless
but
then
she
steps
forward
and
the
ball
shatters
into
large
pieces
like
glass
willow
resumes
walking
warren
nervous
laugh
willow
is
silent
just
walks
toward
him
he
backs
away
very
nervous
close
on
warren's
hand
in
his
pants
pocket
grasping
for
something
he
continues
moving
backward
as
willow
continues
advancing
on
him
warren
turns
to
run
away
willow
holds
out
both
her
hands
and
sends
a
huge
blast
of
magical
energy
at
warren
knocking
him
down
he
quickly
pulls
his
arms
out
of
his
backpack
straps
he
throws
something
at
willow
looks
like
a
small
ball
of
blue
goo
it
hits
her
in
the
stomach
and
begins
to
expand
first
around
her
body
pinning
her
arms
to
her
sides
then
up
and
down
until
her
whole
body
and
head
are
surrounded
by
shimmery
transparent
blue
her
mouth
opens
as
if
trying
to
speak
but
she
can't
warren
jumps
up
and
runs
off
again
leaving
his
backpack
behind
close
on
willow's
eyes
behind
the
goo
they
begin
to
glow
fiery
orange
the
goo
in
front
of
her
eyes
melts
and
then
the
entire
cocoon
melts
and
slides
down
off
her
body

getting
desperate
now

willow
opens
her
hand
revealing
the
bullet
that
she
took
from

chest
earlier
she
waves
her
other
hand
and
warren's
shirt
rips
open
warren
seriously
freaked
willow
holds
the
bullet
about
an
inch
from
warren's
chest
right
over
his
heart
she
lets
go
but
the
bullet
continues
to
hover
in
place
willow
warren
looking
nervously
down
at
the
bullet
then
up
at
her
the
bullet
slowly
starts
to
push
its
way
into
warren's
chest
warren
strained
warren
is
clearly
in
a
lot
of
pain
as
the
bullet
continues
penetrating
his
body
willow
angrily
willow
lifts
a
hand
and
suddenly
warren's
lips
are
sewn
shut
with
large
stitches
of
thread
he
can
only
groan
and
whimper
she
pauses
as
if
affected
by
her
own
words
looking
at
the
little
wound
on
warren's
chest
warren
just
grunts
and
squeezes
his
eyes
shut
in
pain
willow
pensively
willow
warren
groaning
loudly
now
she
looks
warren
in
the
eye
again
refocusing

continues
trembling
groaning
in
pain
and
fear
another
shot
of
the
bullet
hole
in
warren's
chest
warren
continues
whimpering
in
pain
she
leads
them
off
to
the
left
cut
back
to
warren
and
willow
he
continues
grunting
through
his
sewnshut
mouth
she
waves
her
hand
and
the
stitches
disappear

stares
at
him

visible
a
few
hundred
feet
away
rushing
toward
her
warren
panting
willow
makes
a
casual
gesture
with
one
hand
a
bolt
of
magic
rips
through
warren
and
tears
the
skin
off
his
body
in
a
single
piece
anya
buffy
and
xander
arrive
just
in
time
to
see
this
warren's
skinless
body
sags
against
the
vines
that
still
hold
him
very
icky
willow
stands
looking
at
it
buffy
shocked
willow
continues
looking
at
the
lifeless
body
willow
looks
over
at
her
friends
then
back
at
the
body
suddenly
it
bursts
into
flame
and
burns
to
nothing
in
an
instant
willow
calmly
smoke
begins
to
curl
up
around
willow's
body
as
red
fire
flashes
in
her
eyes
again
lightning
flashes
as
her
whole
body
dissipates
into
smoke
and
is
gone
the
others
stand
there
staring
in
horror
blackout
