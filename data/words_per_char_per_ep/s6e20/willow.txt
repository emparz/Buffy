calm
down
when

a
longhandled
axe
is
buried
in
willow's
back
axe

oh
you
mean
instead
of
killing
my
best
friend
you
killed
my
girlfriend
well
this
is
irretite
cute
tricks
i'm
asking
for
it
she
wasn't
your
first
tara
she
wasn't
the
first
girl
you
killed
because
you
liked
it
you
never
felt
you
had
the
power
with
her
not
until
you
killed
her
you
get
off
on
it
that's
why
you
had
a
madon
for
the
slayer
she
was
your
big
o
wasn't
she
warren
what's
the
matter
thought
you
wanted
to
talk
okay
i'll
talk
shhh
wanna
know
what
a
bullet
feels
like
warren
a
real
one
it's
not
like
in
the
comics
i
think
you
need
to
feel
it
it's
not
going
to
make
a
neat
little
hole
first
it'll
obliterate
your
internal
organs
your
lung
will
collapse
feels
like
drowning
when
it
finally
hits
your
spine
it'll
blow
your
central
nervous
system
the
pain
will
be
unbearable
but
you
won't
be
able
to
move
bullet
usually
travels
faster
than
this
of
course
but
the
dying
it'll
seem
like
it
takes
forever
something
isn't
it
one
tiny
piece
of
metal
destroys
everything
it
ripped
her
insides
out

took
her
light
away
from
me
from
the
world
now
the
one
person
who
should
be
here
is
gone

and
a
waste
like
you
gets
to
live
tiny
piece
of
metal
can
you
feel
it
now
i
said
can
you
feel
it
one
down
