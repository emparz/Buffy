you
find

have
haggled
most
of
my
customers'll
bring
you
here
for
five
killing
a
slayer
that's
big
business
for
a
kid
okay
right
what
were
you
a
band
or
something
sorry
so
why
aren't
your
guys
helping
you
slayer
is
the
least
of
your
problems
if
i
were
you
i'd
be
worried
about
the
witch
willow
slayer's
pal
she's
the
new
power
man
anybody
with
intuition
can
feel
it
she's
going
to
blow
this
town
apart

starting

with
you
i
feel
death
she
might
but
somebody's
stone
cold
and
that

is
why
the
witch
wants
your
head
she
can
sense
your
essence
right
now
man
it's
just
a
matter
of
time
before
she
finds
you
hide
or
fight
i
can't
guarantee
anything
not
this
time
the
girl
is
running
on
pure
fury
i've
never
felt
anything
like
it
