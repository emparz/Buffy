what
happened
sure
how'd
i
get
here
willow
what's
wrong
why
we
need
to
stop
i
don't
like
this
and
we'll
catch
him
and
he'll
go
to
jail
look
i'm
finding
the
whole
getting
shot
very
motivating
but
you're
using
magic
maybe
but
this
isn't
right
okay
this
isn't
how
i
want
it
will
you
do
have
a
choice
this
isn't
good
for
you
willow
wait
and
then
what
okay
you
need
to
calm
down
look
you're
angry
i
i
am
too
there's
no
excuse
for
what
warren
did
but
that
oh
my
god
oh
my
god

tara
wwillow
please
just
stop
we
love
you
and
tara
but
we
don't
kill
humans
it's
not
the
way
i
know

i
know
and
i

can't
understand

anything
not
what
happened

aand
not
what
you
must
be
going
through
willow
if
you
do
this
you
let
warren
destroy
you
too
will
please
please
we'll
get
through
this
together
please
just
willow
dawn
i
left
there
hours
ago
she'd
be
back
by
now
dawn
oh
god
dawn
sweetheart
come
on
honey
we
need
to
get
out
of
here
okay
dawn
sweetheart
be
strong
for
me
okay
dawn
we
need
to
go
downstairs
i
don't
understand
either
are
the
police
gone
too
we
need
to
find
willow
dawn
don't
say
that
because
you
don't
really
feel
that
way
xander
being
a
slayer
doesn't
give
me
a
license
to
kill
warren's
human
so
the
human
world
has
its
own
rules
for
dealing
with
people
like
him
sometimes
they
do
sometimes
they
don't
we
can't
control
the
universe
if
we
were
supposed
to

then
the
magic
wouldn't
change
willow
the
way
it
does
and

we'd
be
able
to
bring
tara
back
there
are
limits
to
what
we
can
do
there
should
be
willow
doesn't
want
to
believe
that
and
now
she's
messing
with
forces
that
want
to
hurt
her
all
of
us
i
know
and
now
it
has
to
stop
warren's
going
to
get
what
he
deserves
i
promise

but
i
will
not
let
willow
destroy
herself
i
don't
know
um

maybe
the
magic
box
for
some
kind
of
locating
spell
i
could
go
myself
dawn
can't
stay
here
by
herself
no
honey
it's
too
dangerous
she
does
and
you'll
help
her
lots
okay
but
first
we
have
to
get
her
home
in
one
piece
dawn
i'm
serious
you've
been
through
enough
for
more
than
one

ever
you
should
be
someplace
where
you
feel
safe
all
right
xander
i'll
get
the
coats
he
won't
hurt
dawn
i
hehe
physically
can't
besides
he
wouldn't
dawn
feels
safe
with
him
we
don't
have
a
choice
right
now
he's
all
we've
got
spike
oh
clem
i

sorry
i
didn't
mean
to
startle
you
i
made
you
spill
your
snacks
we're
looking
for
spike
actually
tell
me
what
oh
we're
fine
thank
you
um
but
you
could
do
us
a
favor
do
you
think
maybe
dawn
could
hang
out
here
with
you
for
a
while
i
have
some
stuff
that
i
need
to
do
and
uh
i
really
don't
want
her
to
be
alone
dawn
we've
been
through
this
what
do
you
think
i'll
be
back
as
soon
as
i
can
i
promise
thank
you
did
he
say
when
he'd
be
back
is
everyone

willow

spell
oh
she
wants
to
do
it
herself
