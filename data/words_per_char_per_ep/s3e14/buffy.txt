faith
really
now
is
not
the
time
how
many
times
do
i
have
to
say
it
i
have
never
done
it
with
xander
he's
just
a
friend
thanks
for
the
poetry
and
no
i
love
xander
i
just
don't
love
xander
besides
i
think
it
ruins
friendship
to
do
that
stuff
hey
there's
one
more
i
think
too
much
okay
count
of
three
one
three
diverted
that
was
me
fighting
for
my
life
miss
attention
span
the
count
of
three
isn't
a
plan
it's
sesame
street
i
don't
know
they
didn't
seem
local
look
why
don't
we
grab
the
weapons
maybe
giles
the
wooing
stage
is
always
fun
well
i
think
it's
great
early
admission
now
there's
nothing
standing
between
you
and
a
brilliant
future
i
hear
it's
nice
and
a
place
i'll
never
go
if
i
don't
pass
mrs
taggart's
chemistry
test
tomorrow
i'm
there
oh
i
have
to
go
see
giles
report
on
last
night's
patrol
what
about
is
he
okay
new
watcher
is
he
evil
the
last
one
was
evil
is
he
evil
vampires
killed
'em
uh
one
of
them
had
swords
i
don't
think
he
was
with
the
other
two
mmm
both
pointy
with
like
jewels
and
things
i
really
really
believe
that
and
they're
back
'cause
a
little
bit
late
i
will
whenever
giles
sends
me
on
a
mission
he
always
says
'please'
and
afterwards
i
get
a
cookie
now
why
didn't
i
just
say
that
i'll
see
if
i
can
get
her
back
don't
say
anything
terribly
interesting
while
i'm
gone
faith
wait
look
i
know
this
new
guy's
a
dork
but
well
i
have
nothing
to
follow
that
he's
pretty
much
just
a
dork
that's
the
job
what
else
can
we
do
oh
that
would
be
tragic
taking
the
fun
out
of
slaying
stabbing
beheading
i
don't
you're
way
off
base
again
with
the
grunting
you
realize
i'm
not
comfortable
with
this
what
about
the
assignment
strike
one
no
amulet
there
game
over
faith
looking
for
the
amulet
wasn't
counting
on
the
special
guest
stars
six
against
one
hence
the
hiding
wait
stop
think
it's
a
manhole
tight
space
no
escape
six
against
two
not
unlike
three
against
one
you're
just
gonna
go
down
there
that's
your
plan
we're
surrounded
i
hate
it
when
they
drown
me
we
came
for
the
amulet
it
didn't
suck
how
about
verifying
that
your
'nearly
extinct'
cult
was
out
in
magnum
force
last
night
faith
and
i
got
into
a
serious
party
situation
i
had
to
lather
rinse
and
repeat
about
five
million
times
to
get
the
sewer
out
of
my
hair
but
otherwise
i'm
of
the
good
thank
you
for
asking
that's
one
word
three
times
i
have
a
chem
test
so
sad
that
i'm
actually
happy
about
that
giles
we
need
to
talk
we'll
talk
it
was
intense
it
was
like
i
just
let
go
and
became
this
force
i
just
didn't
care
anymore
i
don't
think
you
can
it's
kind
of
a
slayer
thing
i
don't
even
think
i'm
explaining
it
well
you
see
the
thing
was
faith

didn't
even
wanna
go
down
there
okay

best
part

down
there
in
the
sewers
and
faith
got
three
of
them
on
her
at
once
how
come
your
eye
twitches
every
time
i
say
faith's
name
faith
what's
up
uh
faith
unless
there's
a
total
eclipse
in
the
next
five
minutes
