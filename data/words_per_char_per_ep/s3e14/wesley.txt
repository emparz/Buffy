of
course
training
procedures
have
been
updated
quite
a
bit
since
your
day
much
greater
emphasis
on
field
work
oh
yes
not
all
books
and
theory
nowadays
i
have
in
fact
faced
two
vampires
myself
under
controlled
circumstances
of
course
vampires
well
hello
wesley
wyndampryce
it's
very
nice
to
meet
you
evil
oh
yes
gwendolyn
post
we
all
heard
no
mr
giles
has
checked
my
credentials
rather
thoroughly
and
phoned
the
council
but
i'm
glad
to
see
you're
on
the
ball
as
well
a
good
slayer
is
a
cautious
slayer
well
i'm
glad
that's
cleared
up
as
i'm
sure
none
of
us
is
anxious
to
waste
any
time
on
pleasantries
why
don't
you
tell
me
everything
about
last
night's
patrol
yes
anything
else
you
can
tell
me
swords
swords
one
long
one
short
it
should
fifteenth
century
duelist
cult
deadly
in
their
day
their
numbers
dwindled
in
later
centuries
due
to
an
increase
in
antivampire
activity
and
a
lot
of
pointless
dueling
they
eventually
became
the
acolytes
of
a
demon
called
balthazar
who
brought
them
to
the
new
world
specifically
here
i
didn't
get
this
job
because
of
my
looks
i've
researched
this
town's
history
extensively
they
were
driven
out
a
hundred
years
ago
happily
balthazar
was
killed
i
don't
know
by
whom
balthazar
had
an
amulet
purported
to
give
him
strength
when
he
was
killed
it
was
taken
by
a
wealthy
landowner
named
i
don't
want
to
bore
you
with
the
details
named
gleaves
it
was
buried
with
him
and
i
believe
the
few
remaining
eliminati
are
probably
looking
for
it
for
sentimental
value
oh
no
not
at
all
nonetheless
we
may
as
well
keep
it
from
them
buffy
you
will
go
to
the
gleaves
family
crypt
tonight
and
fetch
the
amulet
are
you
not
used
to
being
given
orders
i
don't
feel
we're
getting
off
on
quite
the
right
foot
ah
this
is
perhaps
faith
they'll
get
used
to
me
these
are
all
the
diaries
then
yours
included
oh
yes
here's
your
first
entry
mm
'her
abuse
of
the
english
language
is
such
that
i
understand
only
every
other
sentence'
oh
this
is
going
to
make
fascinating
reading
not
to
fret
my
mission
scenario
has
her
back
in
one
minute
shouldn't
be
any
trouble
well
looks
authentic
enough
of
course
there
are
tests
to
be
made
before
actual
verification
perhaps
there
were
a
few
more
than
we'd
anticipated
but
i'd
expect
you
to
be
ready
for
anything
remember
the
three
key
words
for
any
slayer
preparation
preparation
buffy
i
must
ask
you
to
remember
that
i
am
your
watcher
from
now
on
anything
you
have
to
say
about
slaying
you
will
say
to
me
you're
not
helping
ah
there
you
are
you're
certainly
giving
me
a
run
for
my
money
i
think
we
ought
to
establish
that
if
you're
going
to
go
out
slaying
you
leave
me
a
number
where
i
can
contact
you
who
are
you
it's
somewhere
safe
how
did
you
know
now
hang
on
a
minute
if
i
may
balthazar
is
dead
am
i
the
only
one
that
remembers
that
what's
going
on
i
didn't
say
you
had
emotional
problems
i
said
you
had
an
emotional
problem
it's
quite
different
the
way
you've
handled
this
assignment
is
something
of
an
embarrassment
to
the
council
the
fact
is
you're
no
longer
qualified
to
act
as
watcher
it's
not
your
fault
you've
done
well
it's
simply
time
for
somebody
else
to
take
the
field
oh
god
oh
god
stay
calm
mr
giles
we
have
to
stay
calm
what
is
that
thing
there's
no
need
to
get
snippy
are
you
out
of
your
mind
this
is
hardly
the
time
for
games
now
hold
on
wewewe
can
deal
with
this
rationally
we
have
something
you
want
you
have
something
we
want
nooo
no
no
no
the
slayer
ggave
it
to
someone
a
tall
man
a
friend
a
friend
of
hers
i
can
tell
you
everything
but
i'd
like
to
have
my
kneecaps
yes
sir
i
didn't
actually
catch
it
giles
