she
burns
friends
like
a
piece
of
wood
when
buffy
reaches
angel
she
jumps
up
on
him
and
wraps
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
her
legs
around
his
hips
angel
supports
her
at
the
waist
and
she's
jealous
of
me
because
she
never
could
angel
i
saw
you
making
friends
hold
herself
up
without
a
spine
buffy
boys
i
like
you
and
she'll
look
me
up
when
she's
doing
fine
angel
reacts
in
his
usual
somber
way
buffy
hops
down
off
of
him
