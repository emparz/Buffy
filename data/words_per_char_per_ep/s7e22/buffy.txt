risk
you

i
need
you
gone
if

a
second
front
and
i
need
you
to
run

whole
smelling
people
thing's
a
little
gross

a
soul

god

you're
not
getting
the
brush
off
are
you
just
gonna
come
here
and
go
all
dawson
on
me
every
time
i
have
a
boyfriend
he's
not
buthe
is
in
my
heart
what
was
the
highlight
of
our
relationship
when
you
broke
up
with
me
or
when
i
killed
you
i'm
well
aware
of
my
stellar
history
with
guys
and
no
i
don't
see
fat
grandchildren
in
the
offing
with
spike
but
i
don't
think
that
really
matters
right
now
you
know
in
the
midst
of
all
this
insanity
a
couple
things
are
actually
starting
to
make
sense
and
the
guy
thing—
i
always
feared
there
was
something
wrong
with
me
you
know
because
i
couldn't
make
it
work
but
maybe
i'm
not
supposed
to
because—ok
i'm
cookie
dough
i'm
not
done
baking
i'm
not
finished
becoming
whoever
the
hell
it
is
i'm
gonna
turn
out
to
be
i
make
it
through
this
and
the
next
thing
and
the
next
thing
and
maybe
one
day
i
turn
around
and
realize
i'm
ready
i'm
cookies
and
then
you
know
if
i
want
someone
to
eat—
or
enjoy
warm
delicious
cookie
me
thenthat's
fine
that'll
be
then
when
i'm
done
i'm
not
really
thinking
that
far
ahead
that's
kind
of
the
point
angel
i
do
sometimes
think
that
far
ahead
be
a
long
time
coming
years
if
ever
ow
if
you
get
killed
i'm
telling
it
slices
dices
and
makes
julienne
preacher
i
cut
him
in
half
let
me
guess
you
can
smell
him
it
wasa
hello
there
were
no
tongues
besides
he's
gone
good
good
i
haven't
had
quite
enough
jealous
vampire
crap
for
one
night
you
know
one
of
these
days
i'm
just
gonna
put
you
2
in
a
room
and
let
you
wrestle
it
out
there
could
be
oil
of
some
kind
involved
the
whoket
how
do
you
figure
it's
volatile
we
don't
know—
angel
said
the
amulet
was
meant
to
be
worn
by
a
champion
faith
still
has
my
room
i
understand
oh
thank
god
you're
not
him
an
army
of
vampires
however
will
i
fight—
have
you
ever
considered
a
cool
name
i
mean
since
you're
incorporeal
and
basically
powerless
how
about
the
taunter
strikes
fear
in
the
heart—
talk
on
i'm
not
afraid
of
you
you're
right
no
yeah
i
just
realized
something
something
that
really
never
occurred
to
me
before
we're
gonna
win
what
do
you
think
you
don't
think
it's
a
good
idea
you
mean
that
i
really
do
i
wouldn't
ask
if
i
didn't
think
you
could
do
it
dawn
needs
to
do
a
research
thing
i
hate
this
i
hate
being
here
i
hate
that
you
have
to
be
here
i
hate
that
there's
evil
and
that
i
was
chosen
to
fight
it
i
wish
a
whole
lot
of
the
time
that
i
hadn't
been
i
know
a
lot
of
you
wish
i
hadn't
been
either
but
this
isn't
about
wishes
this
is
about
choices
i
believe
we
can
beat
this
evil
not
when
it
comes
not
when
its
army
is
ready
now
tomorrow
morning
i'm
opening
the
seal
i'm
going
down
into
the
hellmouth
and
i'm
finishing
this
once
and
for
all
right
now
you're
asking
yourself
what
makes
this
different
what
makes
us
anything
more
than
a
bunch
of
girls
being
picked
off
one
by
one
it's
true
none
of
you
have
the
power
that
faith
and
i
do
so
here's
the
part
where
you
make
a
choice
ok
potentials
in
the
basement
follow
faith
and
spike
it's
right
over
the
seal
xander
i
want
you
with
dawn
dawn
so
what
do
you
guys
want
to
do
tomorrow
i
was
thinking
about
shopping
as
per
usual
i'm
having
a
wicked
shoe
craving
oh
you
could
go
with
full
black
secret
agent
look
i'm
not
worried
i'm
not
worried
i'm
not
worried
i'm
not
worriedas
long
as
willow
can
work
her
spell
before
they—
see
us
willow
so
here's
the
part
where
you
make
a
choice
what
if
you
could
have
that
powernow
in
every
generation
one
slayer
is
born
because
a
bunch
of
men
who
died
thousands
of
years
ago
made
up
that
rule
they
were
powerful
men
this
woman
is
more
powerful
than
all
of
them
combined
so
i
say
we
change
the
rule
i
say
my
power
keep
the
line
together
drive
them
to
the
edge
we
can't
let
them
do—
hold
the
line
i
want
you
to
get
out
of
my
face
spike
what
no
no
you've
done
enough
you
could
still—
spike
i
love
you
spike
