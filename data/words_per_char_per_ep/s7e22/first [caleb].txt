pretty
ain't
it
no
you
killed
him
right
and
proper
terrible
loss
this
man
was
my
good
right
arm
'course
it
don't
pain
me
too
much
don't
need
an
arm
got
an
army
every
day
our
numbers
swell
but
then
you
do
have
an
army
of
your
own
some
thirtyodd
pimplyfaced
girls
don't
know
the
pointy
end
of
a
stake
maybe
i
should
call
this
off
i
will
overrun
this
earth
and
when
my
army
outnumbers
the
humans
on
this
earth
the
scales
will
tip
and
i
will
be
made
flesh
then
why
aren't
you
asleep
in
your
dead
lover's
arms
'cause
he
can't
help
you
nor
faith
nor
your
friends
certainly
not
your
wannaslay
brigade
none
of
those
girlies
will
ever
know
real
power
unless
you're
dead
you
know
the
drill
