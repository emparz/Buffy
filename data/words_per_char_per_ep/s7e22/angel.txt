well
i
guess
that
qualifies
as
happy
to
see
me
not
saving
the
damsel
in
distress
that's
for
sure
got
your
share
of
distress
though
i
got
coverage
on
the
whole
thing
it's
very
gripping
it
needs
a
third
act
it's
the
first
right
the
first
evil
the
power
that
tried
to
convince
me
to
kill
myself
yeah
well
it
failed
once
and
i'm
here
to
tell
you—
ok
now
i'm
pissed
where
is
he
not
remotely
i
uh
brought
something
else
as
well
it's
not
for
you
i
don't
know
everything
it's
very
powerful
and
probably
very
dangerous
it
has
a
purifying
power
a
cleansing
power
possibly
scrubbing
bubbles
the
translation
is
uh—anyway
it
bestows
strength
to
the
right
person
who
wears
it
someone
ensouled
but
stronger
than
human
a
champion
as
in
me
no
i
don't
know
nearly
enough
about
this
to
risk
you
wearing
it
besides
you
got
that
real
cool
axething
going
for
you
shoulder
to
shoulder
i'm
yours
no
what
why
the
hell
not
you
need
me
in
this
why
ok
that's
one
reason
what's
the
other
is
it
spike
you're
not
telling
me
something
and
his
scent
i
remember
it
pretty
well
is
he
your
boyfriend
you
in
love
with
him
ok
maybe
i'm
outta
line
but
this
is
kind
of
a
curve
ball
for
me
i
mean
we
are
talking
about
spike
here
oh
well
that's
great
everyone's
got
a
soul
now
you
know
i
started
it
the
whole
having
a
soul
before
it
was
all
the
cool
new
thing
i'm
getting
the
brush
off
for
captain
peroxide
it
doesn't
necessarily
bring
out
the
champion
in
me
aha
boyfriend
that'll
end
well
because
you're
the
slayer
any
thoughts
on
who
might
enjoy—
do
i
have
to
go
with
the
cookie
analogy
i'll
go
start
working
on
the
second
front
make
sure
i
don't
have
to
use
it
sometimes
is
something
i
ain't
getting
any
older
