it's
one
hell
of
a
risky
idea
yeah
there's
one
more
vent
right
by
the
stairs
we
block
that
they
got
no
sewer
access
should
drive
them
straight
up
into
the
school
proper
which
no
offense
i
am
i
think
i've
had
my
share
thanks
yeah
you
know
what
i
figured
that
one
out
all
by
myself
that's
bleak
that's
good
to
know
'cause
for
a
second
there
i
thought
it
was
more
defensive
isolationist
slayer
crap
faith
there's
a
whole
world
out
there
that
you
don't
even
know
about
and
a
lot
of
the
men
in
it
are
pretty
decent
guys
they'd
surprise
you
why
because
you're
so
hot
oh
please
i
am
so
much
prettier
than
you
are
oh
and
uh
for
the
record
our
little
encounter
didn't
exactly
change
my
world
no
no
no
no
it
was—it
was—it
was
nice
enough
you
know
and
you're—you're
very
um
mm
enthused
and
i
think
with
a
little
more
experience—
yeah
of
course
let's
finish
up
faith—
make
me
a
deal
all
right
we
live
through
this
you
give
me
the
chance
to
surprise
you
you
do
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
right
good
enough
a
little
bit
yeah
welcome
to
sunnydale
high
there's
no
running
in
the
halls
no
yelling
no
gum
chewing
apart
from
that
there's
only
one
rule
if
they
move
kill
them
willow
my
office
is
straight
through
there
ok
civilians
the
vampires
get
upstairs
we
have
3
areas
they
could
get
through
to
another
building
and
then
down
into
the
sewers
down
the
hall
in
the
atrium
the
north
hall
here
and
the
primary
target
through
the
lounge
straight
to
the
science
building
now
odds
are
most
of
them
will
head
there
i
concur
the
bus
get
them
on
the
bus
hey
did
we—
did
we
make
it
surprise
