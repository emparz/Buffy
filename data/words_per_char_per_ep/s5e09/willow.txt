i
just
did
two
of
'em
yay
on
me
that
was
pretty
cool
except
the
part
where
i
was
all
terrified
and

and
now
my
knees
are
all
dizzy
oh
piffle
who
needs
him
when
i'm
dusting
two
at
a
ti
whoops
maybe
it
would've
been
good
if

he'd
shown
up
care
package
special
delivery
for
the
summers
girls
now
let's
see
what
i
have
in
this
sack
of
mine
oh
i
feel
just
like
santa
claus
except
thinner
and
younger
and
female
and
well
jewish
this
is
an
extraspecial
gift
for
your
mom
that
i
know
she'll
need
a
beer
hat
see
iit's
got
cup
holders
and
a
straw
that
goes
directly
into
your
mouth
and
you
can
fill
it
with
other
stuff
than
beer
and
somehow
when
i
was
in
the
store
this
seemed
like
the
most
important
idea
and
now
there's
the
whole
part
where
i'm
crazy
now
let's
see
who's
next
dawn
i
believe
i
have
something
in
here
for
you
all
right
dawn
to
keep
you
busy
oh
well
it
doesn't
actually
have
spells
in
it
just
history
and
anecdotes

have
this
for
you
and
a
yoyo
the
book
is
just
in
case
you
get
a
chance
to
look
it
over
we're
doing
world
war
one
now
the
last
exam
was
really
pretty
easy
just
underlying
causes
and
trench
foot
so
it
should
be
no
hassle
to
make
it
up
buffy
i
don't
even
know
if
i'm
gonna
take
that
exam
she's
gonna
be
fine
and
after
the
operation
no
more
pressing
she'll
be
all
normal
all
the
time
hi
you
know
what's
weird
yes
and
also
you
know
some
of
the
stars
we're
looking
at

don't
even
exist
anymore
in
the
time
that
it
takes
for
their
light
to
reach
us
they've
died
exploded
poof
you
know
i
used
to
love
to
look
up
at
them
when
i
was
little
they're
supposed
to
make
you
feel
all
insignificant
but

they
made
me
feel
like

like
i
was
in
space

part
of
the
stars
there's

canis
minor

and

and
cassiopeia
hmm
you
know
i'm
not
sure
i
remember
that
one
yeah
it's
big
teach
me
hmm
let's
see
a
huge
flaming
meteor
about
to
crash
into
something
wow
we
have
meteorite
something
evil
crashed
to
earth
in
this
and
then
broke
out
and

slithered
away
to
do
badness
it
went
here
ii
know
him
he
he
was
at
the
hospital
a
mental
patient
they
released
him
today
we
can't
call
buffy
i
wanna
call
buffy
so
so
we'll
just
figure
this
out
ourselves
we're
experienced
research
you
got
it
i
don't
wanna
be
the
one
who
finds
the
bodies
any
more
uh
guys
i've
got
some
stuff
the
most
recent
meteoric
anomaly
was
the
tunguska
blast
in
russia
in
1917
some
witnesses
claimed
the
meteor
was
hollow
pretty
far
back
to
the
queller
impact
in
the
twelfth
century
queller
ii
don't
know
why
they
call
it
that
it
didn't
hit
a
place
called
queller
or
anything
it
landed
just
outside
of
reykjavik
in
iceland
okay
i'm
looking
in
history
right
now
it
says
in
the
middle
ages
there
were
these
sweeping
plagues
of
madness
people
were
losing
their
marbles
everywhere
but
then
it
would
suddenly
subside
and
these
dates
look
pretty
close
likelike
maybe
it
happened
after
each
one
of
the
meteor
events
we
should
call
buffy
eexcept
we
can't
call
buffy
can
we
yeah
that's
our
perp
it's
sort
of
a
scavenger
that
can
be
summoned
to
kill
riley
crazy
people
yeah
how'd
you
know
you're
at
the
hospital
oh
listen
riley
i

i
saw
buffy's
mom
earlier
and
she
was
acting
kinda

wacky
insane
wacky
if
you
know
what
i
mean
oh
good
aand
the
thing
the
queller
is
it
still
there
well
okay
but
shouldn't
we
come
help
oooookay
