sorry
my
god
what
a
rough
night
yes
that
was
disappointing
things
would
have
been
easier
if
he'd
been
here
perhaps
he
forgot
hollow
in
all
fairness
we
don't
really
know
about
the
slithered
part
uh
riley
what
are
you
doing
perhaps
we
should
explore
a
bit
more
head
into
the
woods
a
bit
um
give
us
a
call
if
you
need
help
xander
please
we
have
work
to
do
here
because
it's
a
killer
snot
monster
from
outer
space
i
did
not
say
that
demons
enter
our
world
in
all
sorts
of
ways
this
one
came
from
above
well
then
it
would
appear
that
the
world
is
not
being
invaded
how
far
back
does
this
list
of
anomalies
go
so
something
emerged
from
the
meteors

and
quelled
the
madmen
no
but
we
better
call
riley
