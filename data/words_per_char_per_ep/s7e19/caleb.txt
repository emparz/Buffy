oh
now
look
things
don't
go
exactly
your
way
so
here
come
the
waterworks
ain't
that
just
like
a
woman
now
now
little
girl
manners
i
do
imagine
that
firebrand
tongue
of
yours
has
inflamed
many
a
man
weak
as
they
are
this
here's
a
uh
public
school
ain't
it
kinda
deserted
only
just
i
suppose
folks
work
so
hard
at
keepin'
the
lord
out
and
look
what
happens
in
return
he
abandons
you
not
that
he
could
do
you
much
good
now
anyway—
ah
ah
ah
wouldn't
do
that
were
i
you
swee'pea
fightin'
back
didn't
do
you
much
good
last
time
did
it
and
how
is
poor
sweet
xander
let
him
know
he's
in
my
prayers
and
any
time
he's
willin'
i'm
ready
to
finish
the
job
mind
your
manners
i
do
believe
i
did
warn
you
once
you're
angry
frustrated
scared
i
like
that
in
a
girl
you
really
should
relax
a
little
look
at
where
you
are
history's
gonna
look
back
at
you
at
me
at
this
place
and
they're
gonna
see
the
glory
great
things
are
happenin'
now
right
here
this
school
the
seal
it's
all
gonna
be
a
part
of
the
great
sweepin'
tide
of
change
and
you're
gonna
be
a
part
of
it
now
why
would
you
wanna
miss
that
more
importantly
why
would
you
want
to
get
in
its
way
ha
ha
ha
oh
i
knew
you'd
be
a
wild
one—
i'm
gonna
take
such
sweet
pleasure
in
taming
you
i'll
see
you
soon
little
lady
you
know
what
i
figured
out
tonight
every
high
school
in
this
country
from
one
end
to
the
other
smells
exactly
alike
now
why
do
you
suppose
that
is
they
always
think
they
should
put
up
a
fight
that
i
did
reckon
she
got
the
message
even
if
she
doesn't
know
it
yet
so
now
the
big
strong
slayer
goes
back
to
those
girls
she's
just
so
ready
to
walk
them
right
into
it
and
all
we
have
to
do
is
give
her
that
one
final
gentle
nudge
