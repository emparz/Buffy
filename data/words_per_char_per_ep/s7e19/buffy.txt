hey
yeah
you'd
think
these
people
had
never
seen
an
apocalypse
before
what
about
you
just
going
for
a
quick
spin
to
7eleven
in
nebraska
right
yeah
i
probably
should
and
that
you
should
expect
to
see
some
bruising
when
you
remove
the
bandages
bruising
around
the—
area
the
uh
bone
structure
and
musculature
was
hit
pretty
hard
well
we're
looking
at
a
possible
release
as
early
as
tonight
um
we're
just
waiting
for
your
labs
to
get
back
and
dr
kallet
said
that
should
be
a
couple
of
hours
ok
um
i
think
we're
all
caught
up
then
thank
you
for
this
this
was
um
really
great
work
oh
no
i
just—
i
should
really
get
back
i
want
to
get
everyone
started
on
this
i
think
we're
really
close
to
something
he's
doing
really
well
he's
ready
to
come
home
i
think
info
that
giles
and
willow
were
able
to
pull
off
the
police
database
we
figured
with
caleb's
you
know
overt
religiosity
thing
if
we
wanna
learn
more
about
him
let's
find
out
where
he's
been
yeah
i
figure
we
start
with
california
we
don't
find
anything
there
we'll
expand
the
search
but
a
guy
like
caleb
didn't
just
get
in
the
game
he's
been
playing
for
a
while
and
i
wanna
know
where
whatever
it
takes
you
good
to
help
good
ok
try
to
find
anything
that
looks
like
caleb
his
church
his
ring
uh
it's
ok
umyou
know
i—i
have
to
go
to
the
school
to
pick
up
the
rest
of
my
stuff
it's
fine
really
it's
fine
don't
worry
about
it
hey
uh
isn't
anya
doing
that
thing
for
you
guys
today
ok
i'll
be
back
soon
see
that
everyone
else
gets
started
on
this
get
out
of
here
go
near
xander
again
and
i
will
end
you
i
guess
i'm
just
ornery
hey
guys
how's
it—
going
oh
caleb
came
back
looking
for
seconds
still
able
to
make
me
see
cartoon
birdies
all
around
my
head
you
betcha
the
short
lack
of
consciousness
was
nice
i
feel
rested
sohow
did
those
police
files
work
out
were
they
helpful
that's
great
that's—
spike
is
this
a
mission
from
which
you
intend
spike
to
return
alive
again
i
ask
the
question
yeah
well
those
are
the
ones
that
have
been
scaring
me
you
sent
away
the
one
person
that's
been
watching
my
back—again
funny
that's
not
really
what
it
feels
like
where
did
everybody
go
faith
the
girls
where
are
they
faith
what
are
you
doing
girls
go
home
i
need
to
talk
to
faith
for
a
minute
dawn—
you
too
go
what
is
this
taking
a
break
is
one
thing—i
get
blowing
off
steam—but
they
were
fighting
and
those
girls
were
drunk
what
were
you
thinking
yeah
what
if
someone
had
gotten
hurt
faith
i
need
to
know
that
these
girls
are
gonna
be
safe
when
i'm
not
around
learning
from
your
mistakes
is
one
thing
but
you
don't
throw
children
into—
that
really
isn't
the
point
what
welcome
home
xander
i
wanted
you
to
be
here
for
this
i
think
you'll
be
interested
in
what
i
found
out
iit's
about
the
cellar
look
i
know
that
night
wasn't
fun
for
any
of
us
but
i
figured
out
some
things
about
that
place
and
i
realize
now
what
we
have
to
do
we're
going
back
in
look
i
know
what
you're
thinking
but
i
had
a
visit
at
the
school
today
from
caleb
i'm
fine
i
mean
it
wasn't
fun
but
i'm
fine
i'm
better
than
fine
i—i
figured
something
out
he
kept
making
all
this
noise
about
the
school
no
that's
just
it
we've
spent
all
this
time
worrying
about
the
seal
and
the
hellmouth
why
isn't
caleb
guarding
them
why
doesn't
he
have
someone
there
protecting
it
why
is
he
camped
out
at
the
vineyard
the
bad
guys
always
go
where
the
power
is
so
if
the
seal
was
so
important
to
caleb
and
the
first
they
would
be
there
right
now
they're
protecting
the
vineyard
or
something
at
the
vineyard
i
say
it's
their
power
and
i
say
it's
time
we
go
in
and
take
it
away
from
them
i'm
not
saying
it's
gonna
be
easy
did
you
come
here
to
fight
there
is
something
there
i—i
don't
understand
this
for
7
years
i've
kept
us
safe
by
doing
this—
exactly
this
making
the
hard
decisions
and
now
what—
suddenly
you're
all
acting
like
you
can't
trust
me
is
that
why
you
sent
spike
away
to
ambush
me
what
that's
not
what
i'm
doing
what
do
you
mean
you're
not
look
i
wish
this
could
be
a
democracy
i
really
do
democracies
don't
win
battles
it's
a
hard
truth
but
there
has
to
be
a
single
voice
you
need
someone
to
issue
orders
and
be
reckless
sometimes
and
not
take
your
feelings
into
account
you
need
someone
to
lead
you
no
i—
i—
anya
but
you
didn't
earn
it
you
didn't
work
for
it
you've
never
had
anybody
come
up
to
you
and
say
you
deserve
these
things
more
than
anyone
else
they
were
just
handed
to
you
so
that
doesn't
make
you
better
than
us
it
makes
you
luckier
than
us
i've
gotten
us
this
far
xander—
look
i'm
willing
to
talk
strategy
ok
i'll
hear
suggestions
on
how
to
break
this
down
but
this
is
the
plan
we
have
to
be
together
on
this
or
we
will
fail
again
which
is
why
you
have
to
fall
in
line
i'm
still
in
charge
here
because
i'm
the
slayer
no
no
you
don't
get
to
vote
until
i've
had
my
chance
to
pal
around
you
know
get
everybody
drunk
see
i
didn't
get
this
was
a
popularity
contest
i
should
have
equal
time
to
bake
them
cookies
braid
their
hair—
you're
just
lovin'
this
aren't
you
come
in
here
take
everything
that
i
have
you
did
it
before
did
you
tell
them
that
did
you
tell
them
how
you
used
to
kill
people
for
fun
hey
you
guys
think
that's
nifty
wait
guys—
i
can't
watch
you
just
throw
away
everything
that—
i
know
i'm
right
about
this
i
just
need
a
little—
i
can't
stay
here
and
watch
her
lead
you
into
some
disaster
don't
don'tbe
afraid
to
lead
them
whether
you
wanted
it
or
not
their
lives
are
yours
it's
only
gonna
get
harder
protect
them
but
lead
them
