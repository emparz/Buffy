how
was
xander's
mood

and
did
you
get
a
chance
to
talk
to
the
doctor

talk
about
this
later

here's
the
one
that
stood
out
it's
um
a
mission
up
north
in
gilroy
exactly
no
vandalism
at
all
the
place
was
abandoned
um
locals
started
noticing
after
a
few
days
that
no
one
was
going
in
or
out
6
members
of
the
order
lived
there
but
when
the
cops
showed
up
all
gone
unsolved
oh
oh
good

am
i
looking
for
that's
not
a
knothole

helpif
this
does
bring
us
closer
to
caleb
well

are
always
saying
you
wanna
get
out
of
the
house
more
so
see
that's
something
right

have
some
news
soon

actually
be
one
of
the
signs

you
can't
stay
here
buffy
i
love
you
but
you
were
right
we
have
to
be
together
on
this
you
