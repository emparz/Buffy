now
she's
some
kind
of

selling
stuff
person
with
each

had
that
bonus
for
getting
her
fired
only
from
a
perspective
external

timothy
dalton

he
was
a
rogue
agent
that's
edgy
and
he
was
amazing
in
the
living
daylights
timothy
dalton

get
an
oscar

did
good
plus
look
what
warren
and
me
discovered
by
accident
before
we
drove
away
