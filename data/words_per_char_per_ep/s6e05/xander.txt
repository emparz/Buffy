uh
actually
you
won't
be
building
so
much
as
lifting
and
toting
it's
just
a
temp
gig
buff
you
know
unless
it
tanks
since
you're
not
union
i
had
to
call
in
a
few
favors
to
get
you
on
a
crew
uhhuh
so
giles
have
any
thoughts
about
your
little
fastforward
freakout
at
school
okay
first
tip
of
the
day
when
i
introduce
you
to
tony
the
foreman
you
might
wanna
leave
out
stuff
about
blacking
out
and
evil
lint
hey
tony
this
is
buffy
you
know
that
friend
i
told
you
about
give
her
a
chance
she's
stronger
than
she
looks
that's
the
spirit
don't
mind
him
he
may
seem
pigignorant
rude
and
a
little
hostile
have
fun
upstairs
i
need
to
supervise
the
sheet
rock
hangers
don't
sweat
it
i'll
be
back
to
check
on
you
later
oh
my
god
buffy
what

what
happened
how

aw
buffy
i
know
these
guys
can
be
jerks
but
was
it
really
necessary
no
no
not
here
not
at
my
job
that's
your
job
buffy
would
you
look
at
this
mess
do
you
have
any
idea
how
much
it's
gonna
cost
to
repair
this
and
what
am
i
supposed
to
say
to
the
clients
should
i
just
show
them
the
demon
bodies
and
say
it's
all
their
fault
i
know
i
believe
you
in
fact
i'm
starting
to
think
between
this
attack
and
the
school
thing
that
somebody's
messin'
with
you
well
there's
something
going
on
i
think
it's
worth
checking
out
and
i
don't
mean
later
you
need
to
see
giles
and
get
on
it
right
away
i'd
start
with
id'ing
those
demons
big
time
the
whole
melty
thing
oughta
help
narrow
it
down
uh
try
sketching
them
that
always
helps
and
then
maybe
when
i
get
off
work
i'll
help
you
go
through
the
mug
shots
