hello
oh
yep
it's
me
and
i
brought
dinner
deep
fried
chicken
parts
hope
you're
hungry
you
already
ate
it's
okay
more
for
me
what
so
um

it
was

intense
i
don't
iit's

not
important
past
i'd
just

rather
keep
this
one
to
myself
if
that's
okay
oh
um
i've
been
giving
that
a
lot
of
thought
actually
i
think
i've
figured
it
out
what
i
should
do
yeah
i
figure
if
i
hold
off
paying
the
plumber
i
can
pay
the
utility
bill
and
then
i
can
wait
to
reshingle
the
roof
until
we
get
the
refund
back
oh
life
plans
um

well
i
have
no
idea
i
guess
um

well
i
i
left
school
you
know
when
mom
got
sick
but
i
always
figured
i'd
go
back

and
then
she
um
so
ii
was
thinking
about
reenrolling
but
i
missed
the
registration
cutoff
busy
being
dead
and
all
audit
ii
guess
i
could
do
that
yeah
that

sounds
like
a
good
plan
what
do
you
think
giles
i
thought
it
might
be
a
little
weird
being
back
i
mean
it
is
weird
but
like
a
good
kind
of
weird
you
call
your
teacher
mike
boy
school
sure
has
changed
since
my
day
will
i'm
not
following
this
too
well
flowgoing
would
be
a
lot
easier
if
your
classmates
weren't
such
big
brains
maybe
i
should
ease
back
in
with
some
nontaxing
classes
like
introduction
to
pies
or
maybe
advanced
walking
no
look
it's
fine
i
just
need
to
spend
a
little
more
time
reacclimating
you
know
to
get
back
into
the
swing
of
things
what
was
that
uh

that
that
noise
whwhat
was
that
about
about
cooking
whose
yummy
face
i
guess
i

must
have
spaced
out
what
the
f
tara
tara
missed
uh
tara
something
freaky's
going
on
it's
like
i'm
look
there
there
uh
did
you
see
crap
tara
tara
wait
that
noise
there's
something
on
me
diving
into
the
workforce
being
a
breadwinner
building
things
with
my
hands
toting
well
i
appreciate
it
muchly
you
saved
me
from
having
to
accept
giles'
offer
to
work
at
the
magic
box
i
mean
retail
yeee
i'd
rather
be
dead
again
no
oh
well
he
implied
that
maybe
it
was
stressrelated
like
i
was
imagining
it
or
something
i
don't
know
maybe
i
guess
i
i

could
have
been
blacking
out
but

there
was
this
thing
on
my
sweater
you
know
and
then
it
just
blew
away
or
went
poof
maybe
it
was
lint
maybe
it
was
evil
lint
nice
to
meet
you
tony
guys
uh
excuse
me
but
i
whoa
where
are
you
going
it's
buffy
which
way
thanks
so
basically
i'm
just
trying
to
learn
everything
i
can
you
know
'cause
i
don't
want
just
a
job
you
know
i
want
a
career
you
know
something
i
can
grow
into
i
mean
i
never
thought
i'd
be
working
in
construction

but
when
you
think
about
it
kinda
makes
sense
ooh
oh
hey
i
didn't
do
this
wh

i
saved
you
from
the
the
demons
they
were
these
three
big
apey
things
i
can't
help
where
the
forces
of
darkness
attack
me
xander
you
can't
they
melted
but

uh

there
there
are
witnesses
vince
vince
you'll
tell
him
right
how
i
jumped
in
and
protected
you
from
those

things
what
you
were
huddled
in
a
corner
crying
like
a
baby
i
didn't
imagine
this
xander
really
you
think
they're
connected
you're
firing
me
aren't
you
you
know
i've
always
been
interested
in
um
interested
in
retail
uh

is
this
all
research
or
just
some
kind
of
stress
test
for
the
table

i'll
have
to
find
my
own
style
