pretty
sure
it
claimed
to
be
the
original
evil
the
one
that
came
before
anything
else
it
wasn't
a
line
when
i
came
up
against
this
thing
i
felt
it
it
was
ancient
and
enormous
it
nearly
got
angel
to
kill
himself
and
if
we
don't
rescue
spike
soon
god
only
knows
what
the
first'll
get
him
to
do
dawn
he'll
come
to
when
he
comes
to
keep
reading
if
we're
gonna
rescue
spike
we
need
to
figure
out
how
to
fight
this
thing
hand
me
the
watchers'
codex
again
mom
you're
not
real
you're
the
first
no
stop
stop
being
like
this
it's
a
lie
what
hm
did
you
see
it
oh
nothing
it
was
nothing
what
no
was
going
to
ask—
for
the
time
being
but
if
you
don't
tell
us
what
we
need
to
know
then
i'm
gonna
offer
you
to
the
first
on
a
platter
and
let
him
chop
you
into
tiny
pieces
hey
i
was
intimidating
here
forget
it
where's
the
seal
you
better
be
right
this
time
what's
it
do
the
seal
could've
been
activated
i
bet
that's
what
the
first
needed
spike
for
boys
can
we
save
the
encounter
session
we
need
to
cover
this
thing
up
whatever
it
does
we
can't
leave
it
exposed
like
this
i
don't
know
the
first
was
camped
underground
last
time
i
found
him
but—
hey
pills
and
a
cream
and
i'm
all
better
that's
some
fullservice
principaling
oh
i
was
down
here
helping
dawn
with
a
school
project
we
buried
a
um
uh
time
capsule
we
better
go
oh
uh
yeah
uh
i'm
sorry
you
know
i
was
just—i've
been
ill
and
stuff
well
iii'll
be
there
tomorrow
no
problem
100
ooze
free
ok
buffy
and
dawn
walk
away
one
direction
and
principal
wood
walks
away
in
the
other
direction
buffy
turns
to
look
at
him
quizzically
then
turns
back
then
principal
wood
turns
to
look
at
buffy
twirling
his
shovel
as
he
walks
away
dawn's
trying
to
find
out
anything
she
can
about
the
seal
of
danzalthar
will's
about
to
do
a
locator
spell
see
if
we
can
find
the
first
nah
ii
couldn't
sleep
too
much
going
on
you
didn't
see
the
first
i
did
i
felt
it
it
was
like—
will
will
no
it's
not
it's
gone
you're
ok
we
won't
i
promise
ok
i
promise
we
won't
use
magic
to
fight
this
thing
until
we
know
what
we're
doing
i'm
going
alone
it's
out
there
it's
hurting
my
friends
i'll
find
it
giles
the
others
were
murdered
the
first
that's
what
it
wants
and
then
faith
and
then
me
and
with
all
the
potentials
gone
and
no
way
of
making
another
it's
the
end
no
more
slayer
ever
can
we
gag
him
but
what
do
these
records
say
about
the
first
and
that's
what
this
thing
claims
to
be
no
she's
not
wrong
we
need
more
muscle
that's
why
we
need
to
find
spike
under
it
there
was
a
hidden
cavern
just
happened
to
be
under
a
tree
lot
the
bringers
were
doing
some
kind
of
ritual
giles
this
is
bad
isn't
it
a
new
kind
of
bad
you
know
i
didn't
even
realize
it
was
december
maybe
when
we
get
home
we
should
decorate
the
rubble
think
you'll
ever
show
up
for
a
real
visit
the
kind
where
the
world
isn't
about
to
end
good
'cause
i
miss
you
yeah
i'm
pretty
sure
it
was
around
here
somewhere
peachy
except
my
knees
bend
backwards
now
ok
giles
stay
up
there
i'm
gonna
check
it
out
the
others
just
yet
it'll
give
us
a
chance
to—
oh
yeah
i'm
ok
i
just
got
into
a
fight
is
all
you
want
to
tell
me
with
what
you
mean
not
in
front
of
the
next
generation
no
time
to
coddle
them
giles
welcome
to
the
war
room
guys
so
the
first
shows
up
and
now
this
you
think
it's
a
coincidence
no
it's
still
out
there
somewhere
all
of
us
dead
but
for
now
it
looks
like
sunlight
is
keeping
this
ubervamp
away
no
sleep
today
can't
ah
it
comes
with
the
gig
somehow
i
don't
think
taking
on
prehistoric
evil
comes
with
nap
time
sorry
potential
guys
i
know
you
came
a
long
way
and
you
wanna
get
into
it

best
thing
you
can
do
right
now
is
just
sit
tight
wait
it
out
i'm
gonna
go
to
work
see
what
i
can
find
out
i'll
be
back

the
best
plan
ever
yeah
well
i
already
rechecked
the
basement

something
maybe
the
first

modern
technology
displaying
results

through
10
of
900517
ok
i
gotta
narrow
this
down
i'll
call
you
back
yeah
uh
i
know
it's
not
the
alltime
most
kosher
use
of
my
office
hours
um
but
you
know
looking
at
some
down
time
and
what
can
i
say
i
just
love
those
evil
evil
movies
like
exorcist
you
know
blair
witch
different
kind
of
evil
well
it's
not
for
the
kids

kind
of
movies
do
you
like
ow
oh

uh
oh
it's
ok
mom

i
don't
have
time
everyone's
counting
on
me
something
evil
is
coming
and
i
have
to
stop
it
ii
don't
know
yet
but—
oh
um
i'm
sorry
what
were
we
talking
about
no
no
no
no
i'm
different
i'm
hip
i
relate
to
the
young
people
no
don't
go
uh
uh
roger
see
i
knew
that
oh
you'll
be
ok
no
one
expects
you
to
make
everything
right
don't
ok
i'll
be
ok
ok
or
better
it's
like
my
guarantee
uh
i
don't
know
about
that—
we
should
load
them
up
giles
and
that'll
help
us
how
and
when
were
you
good
before
how're
we
doing
on
time
i
just
hope
i'm
calling
the
right
ones
giles
that's
not
exactly
what
i
needed
to
hear
right
now
you're
right
we
don't
know
how
to
fight
it
we
don't
know
when
it'll
come
we
can't
run
can't
hide
can't
pretend
it's
not
the
end
'cause
it
is
something's
always
been
there
to
try
and
destroy
the
world
we've
beaten
them
back
but
we're
not
dealing
with
them
anymore
we're
dealing
with
the
reason
they
exist
evil
the
strongest
the
first
i'm
beyond
tired
i'm
beyond
scared
i'm
standing
on
the
mouth
of
hell
and
it
is
gonna
swallow
me
whole
and
it'll
choke
on
me
we're
not
ready
they're
not
ready
they
think
we're
gonna
wait
for
the
end
to
come
like
we
always
do
i'm
done
waiting
they
want
an
apocalypse
oh
we'll
give
'em
one
anyone
else
who
wants
to
run
do
it
now
'cause
we
just
became
an
army
we
just
declared
war
from
now
on
we
won't
just
face
our
worst
fears
we
will
seek
them
out
we
will
find
them
and
cut
out
their
hearts
one
by
one
until
the
first
shows
itself
for
what
it
really
is
and
i'll
kill
it
myself
there
is
only
one
thing
on
this
earth
more
powerful
than
evil
and
that's
us
any
questions
