was
about
to
be
dead
you
saved
me
the
first
what
oh
not
very
ominous
sounding
no
an
evil
name
should
be
like
lex
or
voldemort
or—
oh
sorry
um
go
ahead

around
this
corner
i
think
i
told
you—i'm
not
sure
i
don't
know
something
not
good
it
didn't
work
'cause
there
wasn't
enough
blood
ok
that
wasn't
there
before
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
he's
in
a
place
of
joy
and
peace
he
told
me
man
this
place
gives
me
the
creeps
it's
like
in
wonder
woman
issue
297299—
and
it
cost
them
their
lives
go
on
so
how
long
have
you
followed
buffy

seems
like
a
good
leader
her
hair
is
shiny

she
make
you
stab
things

to
me
man
i've
got
a
bad
feeling
about
this

above
and
beyond
that
i'm
telling
you
that
my
spidersense
is
tingling

is
gonna
get
hairy

i'm
a
supervillain
like
dr
doom
or
apocalypse
oror
the
riddler

i
admit
i
went
over
to
the
dark
side

to
pick
up
a
few
things
aand
now
i'm
back
i've
learned
i'm
good
again

touché
but
i'm
like
vader
in
the
last
5
minutes
of
jedi
with
redemptive
powers
minus
a
redemptive
struggle
of
epic
redemption
which
chronicles
these
ropes
itch
