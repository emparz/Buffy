buffy
sorry
to
barge
in
we
have
a
slight
apocalypse
potential
slayers
waiting
for
one
to
be
called
there
were
many
more
like
them
all
over
the
world
but
um
now
there's
just
a
handful
and
they're
all
on
their
way
to
sunnydale
in
cold
blood
as
well
as
their
watchers
we
always
feared
that
this
day
would
come
when
there'd
be
an
attack
against
not
just
an
individual
slayer
but
against
the
whole
line
yes
to
erase
all
the
slayers
in
training
and
their
watchers
along
with
their
methods
that's
because
it
predates
any
written
history
and
it
rarely
shows
its
true
face
the
only
record
i
know
was
in
the
council
library
gone
obliterated
they
were
in
session
and
uh
there
was
an
explosion
annabelle
that's
what's
left
the
mystic
secrets
of
the
watchers
and
whatever
i
could
find
on
the
first
when
i
learned
what
was
happening
ii
um
i
stole
them
not—i
didn't
must've
been
an
agent
of
the
first
after
my
little
burglary
session
the
knowledge
contained
in
these
files
had
to
be
protected
and
there
wasn't
time
forfor
bureaucracy
or
debate
the
council
knows
no
other
way
uh
very
little
it
can
change
form
uh
it
only
appears
in
the
guise
of
someone
who's
passed
away
also
it's
not
corporeal
it
can't
touch
or
fight
on
it's
own
it
only
works
through
those
it
manipulates
and
its
followers
the
bringers
the
first
is
unlike
anything
we've
faced
before
i
mean
there's
evil
and
then
there's
the
thing
that
created
evil
the
source
that's
what
it
is
it
has
eternities
to
act
endless
resources
how
to
defeat
it—ii—
honestly
i
don't
know
but
we
have
to
find
a
way
if
the
slayer
line
is
eliminated
then
the
hell
mouth
has
no
guardian
the
balance
is
destroyed
i'm
afraid
it
falls
to
you
buffy
sorry
i
mean
we'll
do
what
we
can
but
you're
the
only
one
who
has
the
strength
to
protect
these
girls—and
the
world—against
what's
coming
of
course
we'll
use
all
our
resources—
this
place
you
originally
saw
the
first—you
say
it
was
in
a
christmas
tree
lot
just
in
time
for
christmas
if
we
survive
this
i
promise
i
miss
you
too
so
the
entrance
to
the
cave
was
above
ground
here
well
we'll
just
keep—
good
lord
are
you
all
right
right
yes
buffy
but
don't
you
think
we
should
uh
discuss
this
privately
uh
what
you
fought
was
a
vampire
but
it
was
um
something
more
than
that
it
was
a
turokhan
as
neanderthals
are
to
human
beings
the
turokhan
are
to
vampires
primordial
ferociously
powerful
killing
machines
as
singleminded
as
animals
they
are
the
vampires
that
vampires
fear
an
ancient
and
entirely
different
race
and
until
this
morning
i
thought
they
were
a
myth
i
think
it's
more
likely
that
the
turokhan
is
here
as
an
agent
of
the
first
so
until
sunset
i
suggest
you
get
some
rest
a
few
hours
sleep
will
do
a
world
of
difference
oh
come
on
you're
exhausted
how
do
you
plan
to
research
something
as
illdefined
as
the
first
this
day's
almost
over
and
the
sun
will
go
down
in
17
minutes
sunset
should
be
any
minute
now
done
everything
we
can
and
don't
worry
everyone
here
understands
that
you're
calling
the
shots
you
have
all
my
faith
and
they're
depending
on
you
we're
back
at
square
one
i'm
not
sure
the
first
predates
everything
we've
ever
known
or
can
know
it's
everywhere
it's
pure
i
don't
know
if
we
can
fight
it
buffy
i—ii
know
you're
tired
