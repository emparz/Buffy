kick
a
dolly
when
he's
down
that
was
always
your
style
has
buckets
of
energy
poor
dear
he's
been
laying
in
wait
for
his
moment
since
before
the
bug
walked
there
there
pet
soon
as
the
moon
comes
you'll
have
your
carnage
little
girls
tear
so
easily
like
pink
paper
'til
then
we'll
have
our
way
with
this
one
got
it
coming
he
does
that's
why
our
kind
make
such
good
dollies
hard
to
kill
tried
to
enlighten
little
buffy
didn't
you
spilled
spilled
spilled
our
secrets
like
seed
but
you
forgot
i
say
what
you
tell
and
what
you
know
i
say
when
this
is
over
and
i'm
not
done
with
you
yet
not
nearly
think
of
it
as
a
game
a
fun
funny
game
without
all
the
rules
or
any
of
the
bothersome
winning
part
but
still
there
are
sides
you
have
to
choose
a
side
spike
then
we
can
flyâ€”be
free
and
visit
all
our
friends
as
they
come
squirming
up
from
out
the
earth
i
know
you
like
a
good
wriggle
and
a
giggle
and
a
squiggle
no
i'm
really
not
ooh
daddy
no
kicking
it's
almost
christmas
day
today
and
you've
gone
spoiling
it
i've
been
so
very
good
all
year
but
i
could
be
bad
if
you
like
bad
daddy
needs
a
caning
never
learned
his
headmaster's
lesson
while
all
the
school
bells
ring
and
ring
and
ring
and
ring
and
ring
choose
a
side
choose
our
side
you
know
that
it's
delicious
what
do
you
say
hmm
stupid
stubborn
daddy
ringing
ringing
ringing
do
you
know
why
you're
alive
you're
alive
for
one
reason
and
one
reason
only
because
i
wish
it
do
you
know
why
i
wish
it
because
i'm
not
done
with
you
and
what
makes
you
think
you
have
a
choice
what
makes
you
think
you
will
ever
be
any
good
at
all
in
this
world
