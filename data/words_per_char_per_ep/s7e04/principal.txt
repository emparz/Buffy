well
you
did
what
you
were
supposed
to
do
you
reported
the
situation
to
me
listen
buffy
it's
hard
kids
this
age
they're
hurting
they're
pissed
off
and
they
say
things
sometimes
they
say
awful
things
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
had
a
thing
with
this
guy
right
real
bully
i
kept
telling
everyone
that
he'd
better
sleep
with
one
eye
open
'cause
i
was
gonna
bust
his
ass
well
i
got
suspended
talk
like
that
is
taken
pretty
seriously
where
i
come
from
beverly
hills
which
is
a
hood
listen
the
point
is
i
was
talking
big
because
i
was
scared
i
couldn't
bust
a
move
back
in
high
school
let
alone
someone's
ass
most
of
the
time
that's
what
it
is
when
these
students
act
out
fear
pain—
every
time
there's
a
threat
like
this
we
do
the
same
dance
inform
teachers
search
lockers
but
we
can't—we
can't
know
what's
gonna
happen
and
we
can't
search
their
brains
we
just—we
just
do
what
we
can
what
do
you
mean
usually
hey
how're
we
doing
oh
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
mean
to
scare
you
it's
been
a
long
week
huh
well
thank
god
it's
friday
i
can't
believe
i
just
said
that
see
you
later
well
there's
nothing
in
this
one
what've
you
got
seems
like
someone's
got
quite
a
coin
collection
huh
