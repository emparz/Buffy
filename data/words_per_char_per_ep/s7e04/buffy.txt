actually
talking
to
the
kids
what
if
their
problems
are
all
weird
and
tricky
check
out
perfect
me
taking
my
sister
on
an
educational
outing
to
the—
the
paper
said
she
had
unusual
cuts
and
contusions
on
her

caskets
were
more
tasteful
anyway

in
hi
do
you
know
why
ok
that's
fine
ok
cut
to
9
int
buffy's
cubicle

what's
on
your
mind
are
you
worried
about
school
uh
friends
girls
your
parents
what
about
them
you
know
it's
awful
being
teased
but
the
thing
is
you
know
with
bullies
like
this
they're
really
just—
divorce
is
terrible
my
parents
got
divorced
when
i
was
a
kid
you
have
to
stick
up
for
yourself
amanda
you
need
to
show
this
bully
that
you're
not
gonna
take
any
more
of
his
sh—guff
uh
any
guff
you
what
sounds
like
your

pretty
tough
you
are
not
messed
up
it
is
not

of

you
should
know
that
there
is
nothing
shameful
about
being
gay
nothing

it's
difficult
for
you
like
maybe
your
sister
makes
it
hard
for
you
to
establish
your
own
identity
you
said
she's
controlling
she
doesn't
let
you
make
your
own
decisions—
i
understand
that
must
be
hard
so
you're
not
doing
your
homework
i
know
high
school
can
seem
kind
of
frustrating
but
if
you
just
get
through
it
then
you
can
go
to
college
you
know
or
you
can
join
the
french
foreign
legion

foreign
legion
