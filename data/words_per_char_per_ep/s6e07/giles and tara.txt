and
it'll
grieve
me
'cause
i
love
you
so
but
we
both
know
wish
i
could
say
the
right
words

to
lead
you
through
this
land

wish
i
could
play
the
father

and
take
you
by
the
hand
wish
i
could
trust
that
it
was
just
this
once

but
i
must
do
what
i
must

i
can't
adjust
to
this
disgust

we're
done
and
i
just
wish
i
could
stay
wish
i
could
stay

wish
i
could
stay
wish
i
could
stay
so
we
sound
our
victory
cheer

where
do
we
go
from
here
