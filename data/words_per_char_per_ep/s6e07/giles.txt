good
morning
buffy
well
i
sang
but
i
had
my
guitar
at
the
hotel
that
would
explain
the
huge
backing
orchestra
i
couldn't
see
and
the
synchronized
dancing
from
the
room
service
chaps
what
did
you
sing
about
i
don't
know
i
should
look
into
it
i've
got
a
theory

that
it's
a
demon

a
dancing
demon

no
something
isn't
right
there
what
can't
we
face
if
we're
together
i
thought
it
didn't
matter
what
text
well
i'm
a
hair's
breadth
from
investigating
bunnies
at
the
moment
so
i'm
open
to
anything
i'm
sure
willow
and
tara
are
making
every
effort
well
i
am
looking
into
some
leads
and
i
well
now
xander
it's
not
quite
that
simple
but
i
have
learned
about
some
disturbing
things
basically
well
clearly
emotions
are
running
high
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
these
people
burnt
up
from
the
inside
spontaneously
combusted
i've
only
seen
the
one
i
was
able
to
examine
the
body
while
the
police
were
taking
witness
arias
we're
not
sure
of
much
buffy's
looking
for
leads
at
the
local
demon
haunts
at
least

in
theory
she
is
but

she
doesn't
seem
to
i'm
helping
her
as
much
as
i
can
but
uh
good
good
it
may
seem
hokey
but
we
need
to
work
on
precision
and
concentration
as
much
as
power
we're
still
not
sure
what
we're
facing
ah
well
if
we
hear
any
inspirational
power
chords
we'll
just
lie
down
until
they
go
away
anyway
i
don't
think
we
need
to
work
that
much
on
your
strength
have
you
spoken
to
dawn
about
that
incident
at
halloween
right
you're
not
ready
for
the
world
outside

you
keep
pretending
but
you
just
can't
hide
i
know
i
said
that
i'd
be
standing
by
your
side
but
i
your
path's
unbeaten
and
it's
all
uphill
and
you
can
meet
it
but
you
never
will
and
i'm
the
reason
that
you're
standing
still
but
i
i
wish
i
could
say
the
right
words

to
lead
you
through
this
land
wish
i
could
play
the
father

and
take
you
by
the
hand
wish
i
could
stay
here

but
now
i
understand
i'm
standing
in
the
way
the
cries
around
you
you
don't
hear
at
all
'cause
you
know
i'm
here
to
take
that
call
so
you
just
lie
there
when
you
should
be
standing
tall

but
i
i
wish
i
could
lay
your
arms
down

and
let
you
rest
at
last

wish
i
could
slay
your
demons

but
now
that
time
has
passed

wish
i
could
stay
here

your
stalwart
standing
fast

but
i've
been
standing
in
the
way
i'm
just
standing

in
the
way
believe
me
i
don't
wanna
go
what
does
he
want
no
yes
we
are
buffy's
going
alone
if
i
want
your
opinion
spike
i'll
i'll
never
want
your
opinion
it's
up
to
you
buffy
your
best
will
this
do
a
thing
to
change
her

am
i
leaving
dawn
in
danger

is
my
slayer
too
far
gone
to
care
what's
it
gonna
take
to
strike
a
spark
so
one
by
one
they
turn
to
me

the
distant
redness
as
their
guide

that
single
flame

ain't
what
they
had
in
mind

it's
what
they
have
inside

going
through
the
motions

walking
through
the
part
she
needs
backup
anya
tara
that's
never
going
to
happen
if
it
was
in
the
shop

then
one
of
us
probably
the
battle's
done

and
we
kind
of
won
tell
me
