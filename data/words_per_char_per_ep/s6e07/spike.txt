the
sun
sets
and
she
appears
come
to
serenade
me
well
i've
seen
some
damn
funny
things
in
the
last
two
days
a
600
pound
chirago
demon
making
like
yma
sumac
that
one
will
stay
with
you
i
remain
immune
happy
to
say
drink
oh
so
that's
all
you've
just
come
to
pump
me
for
information
yeah
well

don't
wanna
bore
you
with
the
small
talk
don't
know
a
thing
nothing
glad
you
could
stop
by
it's
nothing
i
died

so
many
years
ago
but
you
can
make
me
feel

like
it
isn't
so
and
why
you
come
to
be
with
me

i
think
i
finally
know

mmm
mmm

you're
scared

ashamed
of
what
you
feel
and
you
can't
tell
the
ones
you
love

you
know
they
couldn't
deal
whisper
in
a
dead
man's
ear

it
doesn't
make
it
real
that's
great

but
i
don't
wanna
play
'cause
being
with
you
touches
me

more
than
i
can
say

but
since
i'm
only
dead
to
you
i'm
saying
stay
away
and
let
me
rest
in
peace
let
me
rest
in
peace

let
me
get
some
sleep
let
me
take
my
love
and
bury
it

in
a
hole
six
foot
deep

i
can
lay
my
body
down
but
i
can't
find
my
sweet
release
so
let
me
rest
in
peace
you
know

you've
got
a
willing
slave
and
you
just
love
to
play
the
thought

that
you
might
misbehave
but
till
you
do
i'm
telling
you
stop
visiting
my
grave
and
let
me
rest
in
peace
i
know
i
should
go

but
i
follow
you
like
a
man
possessed

there's
a
traitor
here
beneath
my
breast
and
it
hurts
me
more
than
you've
ever
guessed
if
my
heart
could
beat
it
would
break
my
chest
but
i
can
see
you're
unimpressed
so
leave
me
be
and
let
me
rest
in
peace

let
me
get
some
sleep
let
me
take
my
love
and
bury
it

in
a
hole
six
foot
deep
i
can
lay
my
body
down

but
i
can't
find
my
sweet
release
let
me
rest
in
peace

why
won't
you

let
me
rest
in
peace
so

you're
not
staying
then
lookie
lookie
what
i
found
works
for
him
has
a
nice
little
story
for
the
slayer
don't
you
come
on
then
sing
if
that's
all
you've
got
to
say
then
spike
tries
to
grab
the
minion
but
he
breaks
free
and
runs
off
strong
someday
he'll
be
a
real
boy
gah
don't
be
a
stupid
git
there
is
no
giles
if
i
want
your
opinion
spike
i'll
i'll
never
want
your
opinion
look
forget
them
slayer
i've
got
your
back
fine
i
hope
you
dance
till
you
burn
you
and
the
little
bit
the
torch
i
bear
is
scorching
me

buffy's
laughing
i've
no
doubt
i
hope
she
fries

i'm
free
if
that
bitch
dies
i
better
help
her
out
she
will
first
he'll
kill
her
then
i'll
save
her
no
i'll
save
her
then
i'll
kill
her
life's
not
a
song

life
isn't
bliss

life
is
just
this

it's
living
you'll
get
along
the
pain
that
you
feel

you
only
can
heal

by
living

have
to
go
one
living

so
one
of
us
is
living
bugger

should
go
back
inside

the
big
group
sing

your
kumbayayas
out
the
day
you
suss
out
what
you
do
want

probably
be
a
parade
seventysix
bloody
trombones
look

don't
have
to
say
anything
i
died
