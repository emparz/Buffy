oh
hey
did
dawn
get
off
to
school
all
right
we
thought
it
was
just
us
we
did
a
whole
duet
about
dish
washing
there
was
an
entire
verse
about
the
couscous
with
the
books
i've
got
a
theory

some
kid
is
dreamin'

and
we're
all
stuck
inside
his
wacky
broadway
nightmare
i've
got
a
theory
we
should
work
this
fast
i
thought
it
was
neat
the
volumey
text
you
know
the
the
report
yeah
we
could
um
great
we'll
uh
go
check
it
out
and
uh
we'll
give
you
a
call
well
who
wants
to
be
cooped
up
on
a
day
like
this
the
sun
is
shining
there's
songs
going
on
those
guys
are
checking
you
out
the
hotness
of
you
doofus
entirely
do
i
have
to
fight
to
keep
you
'cause
i'm
not
large
with
the
butch
and
you
can't
imagine
what
they
see
in
you
tara
we're
not
just
gonna
stay
here
a
little
confusion
spell
could
i
think
this
line's
mostly
filler
get
out
of
here
