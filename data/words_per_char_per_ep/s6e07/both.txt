'cause
there's
nothing
to
tell
the
vibe
gets
kind
of
scary
but
it's
all
very
well

'cause
god
knows
i'll
never
tell
you
know
i
lied

i
said
it's
easy

i've
tried

but
there's
these
fears
i've
can't
quell
we
could
really
raise
the
beam
in
making
marriage
a
hell

so
thank
god
i'll
never
tell

i
swear
that
i'll
never
tell
i'll
never

tell
