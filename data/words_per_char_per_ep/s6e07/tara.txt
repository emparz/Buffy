whole
thing

were
really
looking
at
me
i
know
exactly
what
they
see
in
me
you
i
lived
my
life
in
shadow

never
the
sun
on
my
face

it
didn't
seem
so
sad
though

i
figured
that
was
my
place

now
i'm
bathed
in
light
something
just
isn't
right

i'm
under
your
spell

how
else
could
it
be

anyone
would
notice
me

it's
magic
i
can
tell

how
you
set
me
free

brought
me
out
so
easily
i
saw
a
world
enchanted

spirits
and
charms
in
the
air
i
always
took
for
granted

i
was
the
only
one
there
but
your
power
shone

brighter
than
any
i've
known
i'm
under
your
spell

nothing
i
can
do

you
just
took
my
soul
with
you
you
worked
your
charms
so
well

finally
i
knew

everything
i
dreamed
was
true

you
made
me
believe
the
moon
to
the
tide

i
can
feel
you
inside

i'm
under
your
spell
surging
like
the
sea
wanting
you
so
helplessly

i
break
with
every
swell
lost
in
ecstasy

spread
beneath
my
willow
tree

you
make
me
complete
ou
make
me
complete

you
make
me
complete

you
make
me
lotta
homework
willow
said
they
have
a
lead
on
the
whole
musical
extravaganza
evil
this
demon
that
can
be
summoned
some
sort
of
lord
of
the
dance
oh
but
not
the
scary
one
just
a
demon
they
don't
even
know
its
name
yet
but
willow
will
find
out
she's
the
brainy
type
what
dawn
willow
and
i
never
fought
about
dawn
i
um

there's
something
i
need
at
the
shop
will
you
be
okay
for
a
little
while
ii
won't
be
gone
long
i'm
under
your
spell

god
how
can
this
be

playing
with
my
memory
you
know
i've
been
through
hell

willow
don't
you
see
there'll
be
nothing
left
of
me

you
made
me
believe
isis
this
the
demon
guy
ii
just
left
her
for
a
few
minutes
no
i
mean
i
don't
think
it'll
help
everything
is
turning
out
so
dark
