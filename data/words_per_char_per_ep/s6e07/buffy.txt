every
single
night
the
same
arrangement

i
go
out
and
fight
the
fight

still
i
always
feel
this
strange
estrangement

nothing
here
is
real
nothing
here
is
right
i've
been
making
shows
of
trading
blows

just
hoping
no
one
knows
that
i've
been
going
through
the
motions

walking
through
the
part
nothing
seems
to
penetrate
my
heart
i
was
always
brave
and
kind
of
righteous

now
i
find
i'm
wavering
crawl
out
of
your
grave
you'll
find
this
fight
just
doesn't
mean
a
thing
thanks
for
noticing
will
i
stay
this
way
forever

sleepwalk
through
my
life's
endeavor
whatever
i
don't
want
to
beeeeee
going
through
the
motions

losing
all
my
drive

i
can't
even
see

if
this
is
really
me

and
i
just
want
to
be
aliiiiiive
what
oh
uh
yeah
i
think
so
so
uh
no
research
nothing
going
on
monsters
or
whatnot
good
good
uh
so
did
anybody

uh

last
night
you
know
did
anybody
um

burst
into
song
like
you
were
in
a
musical
i
don't
remember
but
iit
seemed
perfectly
normal
i've
got
a
theory
it
doesn't
matter
what
can't
we
face
if
we're
together

what's
in
this
place
that
we
can't
weather

apocalypse

we've
all
been
there

the
same
old
trips

why
should
we
care
hey
i've
died
twice
so
what
is
it
what's
causing
it
well
i'm
not
exactly
quaking
in
my
stylish
yet
affordable
boots
but
there's
definitely
something
unnatural
going
on
here
and
that
doesn't
usually
lead
to
hugs
and
puppies
it's
not
just
us
everybody
started
singing
and
dancing
who
now
xander
so
you
know
what's
going
on
a
world
of
no
so
any
idea
what's
causing
this
what
else
would
i
wanna
pump
you
for
i
really
just
said
that
didn't
i
what's
up
you're
all
bad
moody
what
i
feel
like
i
should

bow
or

have
honor
or
something
oh
you'll
figure
it
out
i'm
just
worried
this
whole
session's
gonna
turn
into
some
training
montage
from
an
80's
movie
yeah
i'm
pretty
spry
for
a
corpse
oh
i
thought
you
took
care
of
that
what
would
i
do
without
you
okay
i'm
ready
did
you
just
say
something
so
dawn's
in
trouble
must
be
tuesday
oh
it's
not
your
fault
so
what's
the
plan
i
thought
you
wanted
me
to
stay
away
from
you
isn't
that
what
you
sang
you're
really
not
coming
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
i
touch
the
fire
and
it
freezes
me

i
look
into
it
and
it's
black

why
can't
i
feel
my
skin
should
crack
and
peel
i
want
the
fire
back
now
through
the
smoke
she
calls
to
me

to
make
my
way
across
the
flame
to
save
the
day

or
maybe
melt
away

i
guess
it's
all
the
same

so
i
will
walk
through
the
fire

'cause
where
else
can
i
turn

i
will
walk
through
the
fire

and
let
it
so
one
by
one
they
turn
from
me

i
guess
my
friends
can't
face
the
cold

but
why
i
froze
not
one
among
them
knows

and
never
can
be
told

what
can't
we
face

if
we're
together
how
are
you
with
death
scenes
you
got
a
name
well
i
ought
to
know
what
to
call
you
if
you're
gonna
be
my
brotherinlaw
don't
worry
you're
not
going
anywhere
i
am
deal's
this
i
can't
kill
you
you
take
me
to
hellsville
in
her
place
trust
me
won't
help
that's
life
i
think
you
already
know
life's
a
show

and
we
all
play
our
parts

and
when
the
music
starts
we
open
up
our
hearts
it's
all
right

if
some
things
come
out
wrong
we'll
sing
a
happy
song

and
you
can
sing
along
where
there's
life
there's
hope

every
day's
a
gift

wishes
can
come
true

whistle
while
you
work
so
hard
all
day
to
be
like
other
girls
to
fit
in
in
this
glittering
world
don't
give
me
songs
don't
give
me
songs
give
me
something
to
sing
about
i
need
something
to
sing
about
life's
a
song

you
don't
get
to
rehearse

and
every
single
verse

can
make
it
that
much
worse
still
my
friends

don't
know
why
i
ignore

the
million
things
or
more

i
should
be
dancing
for
all
the
joy

life
sends

family

and
friends

all
the
twists

and
bends

knowing
that

it
ends

well
that

depends
on
if
they
let
you
go
on
if
they
know
enough
to
know
that
when
you've
bowed

you
leave
the
crowd
there
was
no
pain

no
fear
no
doubt

till
they
pulled
me
out

of
heaven
so
that's
my
refrain
i
live
in
hell
'cause
i've
been
expelled

from
heaven

i
think
i
was
in
heaven
so
give
me
something
to
sing
about
please

give
me
something
hey
i
don't
want
to
spike
i
touch
the
fire
and
it
freezes
me
