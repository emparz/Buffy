and
yet
you
say
that
the
the
vampire
went
to
the
demon's
aid
the
two
of
them
were
working
as
a
team
extraordinarily
odd
as
a
rule
demons

have
no
empathy
for
any
of
the
species
other
than
their
own
in
fact
most
think
of
vampires
as

abominations
mixing
with
human
blood
and
all
adam
um
i
suggest
that
uh
over
the
next
several
nights
you
two
concentrate
your
patrol
in
that
same
area
if
there's
any
other
peculiar
pairings
or
groupings
you
let
me
know
party
at
a
time
like
this
who
well
whose
idea
was
that
point
taken
well
much
as
i
uh
long
for
a
good
kegger
i
have
other
plans
the
espresso
pump
i'm
um
uh
it's
a
a
meeting
of
uh
grownups
it
couldn't
possibly
be
of
any
interest
to
you
lot
yes
thank
you
willow
i
did
attend
university
in
the
mesozoic
era
i
do
remember
what
it's
like
no
one
knows
what
it's
like

to
be
the
bad
man

to
be
the
sad
man

behind
blue
eyes

no
one
knows
what
it's
like

to
be
hated
to
be
fated
but
my
dreams
they
are
as
empty
as
my
conscience
seems
to
be
i
have
hours
only
lonely
my
love
is
vengeance
that's
never
freeee
no
one
knows
what
it's
like
and
i
blame
you
the
song
trails
off
as
we
cut
back
to
lowell
house
now
deserted
wreckage
everywhere
the
camera
pans
across
the
room
and
up
the
stairs
to
riley's
door
just
like
before
only
now
the
vines
cover
the
entire
door
and
much
of
the
ceiling
and
floor
nearby
muffled
howling
and
screeching
noises
when
you
called
to
buffy
and
riley
they
didn't
cry
out
or
or
respond
in
any
way
doing
what
i
didn't
think
you
meant

in
the
midst
of
all
that
do
you
really
think
they
were
keeping
it
up
oh
for
a
different
phrasing
in
what
way
well
it
could
be
some
form
of
uh
succubi
or
a
satyr's
prank
it
could
even
be
energy
coming
from
the
the
lab
underneath
the
lowell
fraternity
if
there
were
deaths
then
uh
perhaps
we're
dealing
with
a
fairly

standard
haunting
when
did
she
die
of
course
i
i
suppose
you
were
like
a
mother
to
them
you
did
everything
for
them
yes
wonderful
uh
congratulations
um
this'll
sound
a
little
strange
but
ah
did
you
notice
any
odd
disturbances
in
the
house
wewell
um
like
uh
furniture
moving
of
its
own
accord
or
uh
objects
appearing
out
of
nowhere
or
or
perhaps
you
saw
someone
appear
one
moment
and
then
they
were
gone
the
next
iinexplicably
yes
it
does
doesn't
it
yes
um
well
forgive
me
for
for
asking
this
but
um
the
children
in
your
care
were
any
of
them
ever
ill
or
did
anything
ever
happen
to
any
of
them
oh
yes
well
ah
children
will
be
children
they
you
know
they
do
like
to
play
in
the
uh
the
muck
very
uh
perceptive
of
you
but
you

helped
them
you
held
them
under
well
someone
ought
to
you
traumatized
and
and
abused
these
children
children
who
who
have
no
doubt
become
extremely
disturbed
adults
you
have
ruined
lives
mrs
holt
furthermore
what
you
did
has
now
manifested
itself
as
a
a
malevolent
presence
which
threatens
still
more
lives
you
have
a
great
deal
to
answer
for
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
ghosts
not
a
ghost
an
apparition
i
believe
we're
dealing
with
a
kind
of
poltergeist
a
whole
cluster
of
them
in
fact
born
out
of
intense
adolescent
emotion
and
sexual
energy
yes
and
now
the
poltergeists
are
drawing
more
and
more
energy
out
of
them
feeding
on
them
in
fact
buffy
and
riley
are
are
powering
this
whole
thing
she's
right
you
should
just
stay
outside
hohow
will
we
know
when
it
works
find
it
in
your
hearts
to
leave
our
friends
passage
what's
happened
