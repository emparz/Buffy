you
know
why
not
those
initiative
men
make
me
not
comfortable
and
you
don't
care
so

you
don't
think
i'm
desirable
enough
to
be
flirted
with
is
that
it
you
don't
find
me
attractive
anymore
oh
really
well
then
why
didn't
we
have
sex
last
night
i
know
twice
i
can't
believe
we're
breaking
up
of
course
we
are
you
you've
obviously
grown
tired
of
me
i
mean
i've
seen
it
happen
to
thousands
of
women
over
the
centuries
i
just
never
thought
it
would
happen
to
me
i
don't
understand
i'm
pretty
i'm
young
i
mean
why
didn't
you
take
advantage
of
me
is
something
wrong
with
your
body
well
there
must
be
i
saw
that
wrinkled
man
on
tv
talking
about
erectile
dysfunction
spike
what
are
you
doing
you
made
me
yell
really
high
i'm
not
paying
you
for
scaring
me
oh
well
now
that's
just
ludicrous
you
can't
hurt
me
because
you've
got
that
chip
in
your
brain
also
i
like
my
money
the
way
it
is
when
it's
mine
oh
now
come
on
you're
not
even
bumpy
anymore
does
this
really
work
scaring
people
into
giving
you
their
money
i'm
beginning
to
understand
why
you're
so
friendless
a
year
and
a
half
ago
i
could
have
eviscerated
him
with
my
thoughts
now
i
can
barely
hurt
his
feelings
things
used
to
be
so
much
simpler
yeah
now
everything's
complicated
of
course
it
did
it
always
does
seen
a
thousand
relationships
first
there's
the
love
and
sex
and
then
there's
nothing
left
but
the
vengeance
that's
how
it
works
i
don't
know
i
just
can't
you
can
go
do
dru
though
initiative
soldiers
they
live
here
experiments
happen
in
the
lab
under
the
house
it's
where
they
kept
you
put
in
your
chip
let's
have
fun
it's
not
very
convincing
is
it
xander
stop
we
didn't
have
sex
if
that's
what
you
mean
that's
all
i
do
now
not
have
sex
yes
the
normal
part
of
the
ending
a
relationship
right
before
the
vengeance
begins
relax
i'm
not
gonna
do
it
i'm
just
trying
to
tell
you
that
we
have
nothing
in
common
besides
both
of
us
liking
your
penis
and
now
i
don't
even
have
that
so
i
get
to
say
when
it's
done
and
it's
done
you're
leaving
me
where
are
you
going
well
then
then
i'm
staying
too
to
to
show
you
how
much
i'm
not
bothered
by
you
having
fun
because
i'll
be
having
more
fun
me
too

big
soldier

ghosts

repression

disembodied
spirits

have
no
ass

of
being
without

little
hungry
