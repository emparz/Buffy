no
no
i
don't
mind
at
all
i
was
up
early
morning
prayer
and
i
like
talking
about
my
kids
i
still
call
them
that
my
kids
oh
yes
i
fed
them
clothed
them
educated
them
in
the
way
of
the
lord
i
was
given
a
medal
i
don't
understand
why
that
sounds
like
crazy
talk
well
some
had
the
flu
and
such
no
one
died
if
that's
what
you
mean
the
engraving
on
the
medal
says
how
good
i
was
with
the
children
i
treated
them
as
i
would
my
own
flesh
and
blood
gave
them
hugs
and
praise
when
they
were
good
and

punished
them
when
they
were
dirty
my
kids
didn't
think
i
knew
but
i
did
without
me
they
would
have
been
shut
out
of
the
kingdom
lost
to
lust
the
girls
felt
the
vanity
more
than
the
boys
i'd
see
them
preening
like
jezebel
doting
over
their
pretty
hair
i'd
remove
the
temptation
to
admire
themselves
they
were
better
for
it
i
performed
baptisms
on
the
most
unclean
those
who
were
tainted
with
impure
thought
and
deed
they
needed
to
be
reborn
you
choose
to
pass
judgment
on
me
i
refuse
to
listen
to
this
when
i
can
smell
the
sin
on
each
and
every
one
of
you
