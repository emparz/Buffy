see
the
thing
that
they're
afraid
to
teach
us
about
is
the
inherent
sensuality
of
language
i
mean
you
you
learn
french
and
they
make
it
all
about
conjugations
and
uh
fronted
vowels

but
nobody
really
talks
about

you
know
the
way
language
tastes
you
know
the
the
way
it
feels
rolling
over
your
tongue
i
mean
just
think
about
car
versus
voiture
oh
wow
fine
i

oh
oh
my
god
wow
wow
yeah
well
hey
evan
evan
come
here
you
gotta
see
this
no
no
no
first

just

put
your
hand
right

here
here
now
stay
don't
move
