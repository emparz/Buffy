she's
not
here
i'm
all
right
i
saw
mom
she
was
here
willow
i
saw
her
she
was
here
and
she
spoke
to
me
no
she
was
right
here
and—and
then
she
wasn't
she—
what
i
don't
understand
but
that's
what
she
said
mom
she
said
that
things
were
coming
that
things
were
on
their
way
and
that
she
loves
us
so
it
had
to
be
her
right
i
mean
her
warning
was
true
so
maybe
the
evil
thing
messing
with
you
was
here
too
only
maybe
it
was
the
thing
trying
to
keep
mom
away
'cause
she
was
trying
to
protect
me
maybe
you
only
think
spike
is
turning
people
'cause
that
vampire
told
you
so
right
but
that
night
we
were
all
told
things
that
weren't
true
what
what
maybe
so
it's
true
what
that
vampire
told
buffy
turned
out
to
be
true
wait
is
he—is
he
staying
here
