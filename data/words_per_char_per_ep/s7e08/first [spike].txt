you
shouldn't
have
done
that
it's
not
time
yet
not
nearly
you're
going
against
the
plan
but
we
can
make
it
work
there's
an
order
the
slayer's
not
in
order
but
it
can't
hurt
to
play
get
your
claws
in
the
mouse
you
know
early
one
morning
just
as
the
sun
was
rising
i
heard
the
fair
maid
sing
in
the
valley
down
below
oh
don't
deceive
me
oh
never
leave
me
how
could
you
use
a
poor
maid
so
and
it's
just
about
to
get
fun
you
know
what
i
want
you
to
do
they're
waiting
for
you
take
her
taste
her
make
her
weak
you
failed
them
now
she's
gonna
kill
you
you
lose
mate
