so
um
what
kind
of
name
is
spike
what—are
you
gonna
make
me
guess
all
right
i'll
guess
you're
a
little
bit
bad
huh
am
i
right
are
you
a
bad
boy
'cause
i
don't
mind
you
know
i
was
getting
pretty
bored
waiting
over
there
in
that
line
i
hate
waiting
know
what
i
mean
um
is
everything—
one
of
them
take
your
wallet
the
way
you're
scanning
that
crowd—you
look
like
you're
out
for
blood
hmm
was
it
me
not
even
if
i
ask
nice
or
are
you
the
type
that
has
to
be
convinced
huh
i
get
it
you'd
rather
i
slip
into
something
more
comfortable
should
we
pick
off
the
crowd
onebyone
or
block
the
exits
and
ravish
the
place
what's
with
the
wallflower
act
you
didn't
seem
so
shy
when
you
were
biting
me
i'm
not
asking
if
you
wanna
be
soul
mates
just
figured
you'd
wanna
have
some
fun
i
take
him
you
take
her—or
the
other
way
around
whatever
is
that
all
i
was
to
you—a
onebite
stand
