who
are
these
people
i'm
sorry
i
was
just
no
not
thinking
having
a
lot
of
happy
nonthoughts
i
love
it
when
things
are
quiet
around
here
yeah
but
we'll
let
you
off
this
time
angel's
sources
say
the
contract's
off
getting
better
oh
yeah
xander
you
guys
wait
here
a
second
mom
oh
my
i'm
sorry
i
i
heard
hi
so
all
these
late
nights
at
the
gallery
recently
i
gather
you
were
cataloging
more
than
art
how'd
you
meet
to
meet
new
people
and
smooch
them
in
my
kitchen
no
thanks
i'm
okay
i
am
any
others
what
i
kill
vampires
that's
my
job
yeah
fine
i
killed
a
vampire
here
on
wednesday
why
are
they
hanging
out
at
the
park
vampires
are
creeps
i
mean
people
are
perfectly
happy
getting
along
and
then
vampires
come
and
they
run
around
and
they
kill
people
and
they
take
over
your
whole
house
they
start
making
these
stupid
little
mini
pizzas
and
everyone's
like
'i
like
your
mini
pizzas'
but
i'm
telling
you
i
am
no
forget
it
think
there'll
be
anymore
ii
can
wait
if
you
say
one
more
word
things
will
become
dire
fine
so
he's
a
good
cook
well
what
does
that
really
tell
you
about
a
person
i
don't
know
him
i
i
mean
so
far
all
i
see
is
someone
who
apparently
has
a
good
job
seems
nice
and
polite
and
my
mother
really
likes
him
i'm
just
saying
there's
something
a
little
too
clean
about
this
clown
he's
not
my
father
figure
i
am
not
okay
i
admit
it's
weird
seeing
my
mother
frenching
a
guy
is
definitely
a
ticket
to
therapy
land
but
it's
more
than
that
i'm
pretty
good
at
sensing
what's
going
on
around
me
and
there
is
definitely
something
wrong
with
this
ted
of
course
ted
who'd
you
think
i
was
talking
about
what
are
you
doing
here
well
uh
you
know
what
we
we
would
love
to
honestly
but
um
unfortunately
we
have
that
thing
on
saturday
so
mom's
like
'do
you
think
ted
will
like
this'
and
'this
is
ted's
favorite
show'
and
'ted's
teaching
me
computers'
and
'ted
said
the
funniest
thing'
and
i'm
like
'that's
really
great
mom'
and
then
she
said
i
was
being
sarcastic
which
i
was
but
i'm
sorry
if
i
don't
wanna
talk
about
ted
all
the
time
i'm
sorry
i
just
have
so
much
to
deal
with
i
don't
need
some
new
guy
in
my
life
well
sure
if
you're
gonna
use
wisdom
okay
so
my
mom
needs
a
guy
in
her
life
does
it
have
to
be
ted
my
dad
yeah
okay
that's
not
gonna
happen
fine
fine
i'll
give
ted
a
chance
i'll
play
minigolf
and
i'll
smile
and
curtsy
and
be
the
dutiful
daughter

i
have
to
like
him
finally
something
i
wanna
do

just
go
hit
my
ball
from
the
rough
hey
how
'bout
that
got
a
hole
in
two
okay
so
fine
my
score
or
whatever
it's
just
a
game
then
i
guess
it's
a
good
thing
i'm
not
in
your
house
hey
i'd
just
like
to
eat
something
around
here
that
ted
didn't
make
look

know
you
think
he's
great
and
all
but

him
when
you're
a
single
parent

threatened
me
he
threatened
me
he
said
that
he
was
gonna

my
face
yeah
i
kicked
my
ball
in
put
me
in
jail
