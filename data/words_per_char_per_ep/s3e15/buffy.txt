but
that's
ii
mean
that's
that's
not
really
our
jurisdiction
is
it
she's
a
friend
done
i
mean
we
were
done
right
faith
we
have
to
tell
i
can't
pretend
to
investigate
this
i
can't
pretend
that
i
don't
know
i
am
trying
to
protect
you
look
ifif
we
don't
do
the
right
thing
it's
only
gonna
make
things
worse
for
you
faith
what
we
did
was
hey
not
right
now
ii
um
i
think
she
bailed
willow
i
was
won
um
you
go
ahead
okay
see
you
oh
it's
okay
faith
i
know
i
don't
think
he
was
in
that
alley
by
chance
i
think
he
was
looking
for
us
i'd
like
to
know
why
you
were
saying
except
that
somebody
didn't
want
us
to
prove
anything
actually
yeah
i
didn't
get
the
bad
guy
vibe
off
of
him
i
guess
you
know
a
lot
about
that
it's
just
look
at
you
faith
less
than
twentyfour
hours
ago
you
killed
a
man
aand
now
it's
all
zipadeedoodah
it's
not
your
real
face
and
i
know
it
look
i
know
what
you're
feeling
because
i'm
feeling
it
too
dirty
like
something
sick
creeped
inside
you
and
you
can't
get
it
out
and
you
keep
hoping
that
it
was
just
some
nightmare
but
it
wasn't
and
we
are
gonna
have
to
figure
out
just
let
me
talk
to
giles
okay
i
swear
and
if
it
doesn't
and
that's
it
you
just
live
with
it
you
see
the
dead
guy
in
your
head
every
day
for
the
rest
of
your
life
we
help
people
it
doesn't
mean
we
can
do
whatever
we
want
maybe
but
what
if
he
was
coming
to
us
for
help
to
kill
demons
but
it
does
not
mean
that
we
get
to
pass
judgment
on
people
like
we're
better
than
everybody
else
i
am
late
um
aa
little
past
100
i
guess
we
were
at
faith's
watching
tv
infomercial
is
that
it
i'm
kinda
beat
i
wish
i
could
help
you
hey
i
need
to
talk
to
you
yeah
me
too
it's
more
complicated
than
that
will
i'm
in
trouble
and
faith
acts
like
she
doesn't
even
care
the
way
she
talks
it's
like
she
didn't
even
make
a
mistake
i
don't
know
and
i
think
that
detective
knows
more
than
he's
saying
i
think
he
knew
that
i
was
lying
giles
uh
i
don't
really
know
how
to
say
this
so
i'm
i'm
i'm
just
gonna
say
it
i
know
i've
kept
things
from
you
before
but
but
um
but
ii've
been
blowing
off
my
classes
you
know
inin
the
sense
of
not
attending
and
uh
you
told
him
what
i
did
giles
no
thathat's
just
not
what
happened
no
it
you
can't
be
serious
you're
setting
me
up
giles
please
you
have
to
giles
i
didn't
do
this
i
swear
look
i
know
that
i
messed
up
badly
but
the
murder
iit
it
was
oh
oh
god
i
thought
try
far
like
all
the
way
i
know
well
i
i
wanted
to
it's
not
all
her
fault
giles
we
both
thought
it
was
a
vampire
ii
only
realized
it
a
second
before
it's
not
wwhat
do
you
do
she's
freaking
so
so
then
we
just
have
to
help
her
deal
right
ii
could
talk
to
her
or
maybe
i'm
too
close
maybe
maybe
one
of
the
guys
could
okay
of
course
you
mean
like
that
intervention
thing
that
you
guys
did
on
me
as
i
recall
xander
and
i
nearly
came
to
blows
a
connection
why
would
you
think
that
when
did
you
guys
hang
out
and
you
guys
talked
then
why
would
you
oh
alright
look
ii
know
that
you
mean
well
xander
but
um
ii
just
don't
see
faith
opening
up
to
you
she
doesn't
take
the
guys
that
she
has
a
'connection'
with
very
seriously
and
they're
they're
kind
of
a
big
joke
to
her
no
offense
yeah
they
they
seemed
pretty
cozy
the
other
night
what
about
faith
she
needs
help
now
i
owe
her
that
cut
to
the
girls'
bathroom
the
camera
pulls
in
to
a
stall
with
its
door
not
quite
closed
wish
we
never
met
by
kathleen
wilhoite
plays
over
the
scene
how's
she
doing
but
you'll
keep
trying
right
so
what
do
i
do
well
this
could
take
awhile
right
so
i'll
just
go
to
faith's
and
i'll
get
some
of
her
stuff
that
way
she'll
see
that
we're
on
her
side
okay
i'll
be
back
she
does
she
just
doesn't
know
how
to
say
it
giles
said
with
counseling
they
might
not
even
need
to
lock
her
up
i
know
and
then
what
so
we
head
them
off
at
the
airport
and
stop
them
she's
out
of
control
i
know
but
angel
was
getting
somewhere
with
her
she
was
opening
up
if
we
could
just
stop
wesley
but
you
didn't
you
probably
destroyed
her
i
better
find
her
before
she
does
any
more
damage
we're
gonna
need
to
split
up
i'll
check
the
docks
that's
probably
where
she
is
giles
why
don't
you
go
to
her
motel
xander
willow
her
haunts
and
be
careful
you
still
got
your
ticket
back
to
the
mother
country
not
on
my
friends
no
we
could
be
it's
not
too
late
faith
nobody
is
asking
you
to
be
like
me
but
you
can't
go
on
like
this
yeah
it
scares
me
faith
you're
hurting
people
you're
hurting
yourself
no
no
faith
you're
sick
don't
you
dare
bring
him
into
this
no
no
i'm
not
gonna
do
this
oh
god
she
could
have
left
me
there
to
die
giles
but
she
didn't
i'm
not
gonna
give
up
on
her
