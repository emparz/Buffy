hey
where's
faith
ii
saw
her
around
figured
you
two
were
gonna
go
kill
some
more
nasty
stuff
actually
i'm
i'm
late
ii'm
meeting
michael
the
warlock
guy
we're
still
trying
to
derat
amy
so
see
ya
hey
good
'cause
i've
been
letting
things
fester
and
i
don't
like
it
i
wanna
be
festerfree
i
mean
don't
get
me
wrong
ii
completely
understand
why
you
and
faith
have
been
doing
the
bonding
thing
you
guys
work
together
you
you
should
get
along
but
see
it's
that
exact
thing
thatthat's
just
ticking
me
off
it's
this
whole
'slayers
only'
attitude
i
mean
since
when
wouldn't
i
understand
you
you
talk
to
me
about
everything
iit's
like
all
of
a
sudden
ii'm
not
cool
enough
for
you
because
i
can't
kill
things
with
my
bare
hands
oh
oh
buffy
don't
cry
i'm
sorry
ii
was
too
hard
on
you
sometimes
i
unleash
ii
don't
know
my
own
strength
iiit's
bad
iii'm
bad
i'm
a
bad
bad
bad
person
do
you
think
she's
like
iin
shock
you
have
to
go
to
giles
buffy
he'll
know
what
to
do
well
maybe
we
should
all
talk
to
faith
together
i
don't
need
to
say
'oh'
i
got
it
before
they
slept
together
what
oh
uh
sure
i
can
try
then
he
figured
it
out
can
i
ii'm
just
wondering
why
i'm
not
the
most
objective
i
know
i
kind
of
have
an
issue
with
faith
sharing
my
people
but
she
murdered
someone
and
accused
buffy
then
she
hurt
xander
i
hate
to
say
it
but
maybe
she
belongs
behind
bars
