disappointment
stops
by
from
time
to
time
the
sound
of
sobbing
is
coming
from
inside
the
stall
cut
inside
willow
sits
there
crying
her
eyes
out
to
see
how
i'm
doing

and
he
came
by
last
night
right
after
you
left

my
life
in
ruin
cut
to
the
library
xander
sits
on
the
steps
to
the
stack
level
staring
off
into
space
and
tapping
his
fingers
when
i
don't
get
what
i
want
cut
to
faith's
room
she's
lying
on
her
bed
idly
watching
tv
the
spoiled
child
inside
breaks
down
she
hears
a
knock
at
her
door
she
rolls
off
her
bed
and
goes
to
answer
it
it's
xander
