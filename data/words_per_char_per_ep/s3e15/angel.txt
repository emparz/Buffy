your
hand
i'm
sorry
about
the
chains
it's
not
that
i
don't
trust
you
actually
it
is
that
i
don't
trust
you
and
he
forgot
the
safety
word
is
that
it
i
bet
you're
not
big
on
trust
games
now
are
you
faith
no
i
just
wanna
talk
to
you
it's
like
talking
to
a
wall
only
you
get
more
from
a
wall
sure
we're
just
getting
started
look
right
now
there's
nothing
that
you
can
do
that's
a
good
idea
look
i
i
don't
want
you
to
get
your
hopes
up
buffy
she
may
not
want
us
to
help
her
she
killed
a
man
that
changes
everything
for
her
that's
not
what
i
mean
she's
taken
a
life
she's
got
a
taste
for
it
now
i
know
what's
goin'
on
with
you
hmm
but
i
know
what
it's
like
to
take
a
life
to
feel
a
future
a
world
of
possibilities
snuffed
out
by
your
own
hand
i
know
the
power
in
it
the
exhilaration
it
was
like
a
drug
for
me
hmm
a
professional
couldn't
have
helped
me
it
stopped
when
i
got
my
soul
back
my
human
heart
faith
you
have
a
choice
you've
tasted
something
few
ever
do
i
mean
to
kill
without
remorse
is
to
feel
like
a
god
but
you're
not
a
god
you're
not
much
more
than
a
child
going
down
this
path
will
ruin
you
you
can't
imagine
the
price
for
true
evil
you
and
me
faith
we're
a
lot
alike
time
was
i
thought
humans
existed
just
to
hurt
each
other
but
then
i
came
here
and
i
found
out
that
there
are
other
types
of
people
people
who
genuinely
wanted
to
do
right
and
they
make
mistakes
and
they
fall
down
you
know
but
they
keep
caring
it
was
the
new
watcher
he
had
a
couple
of
guys
helping
him
that's
good
work
first
you
terrorize
her
then
you
put
her
back
in
the
streets
i'll
try
the
airport
