uh
you
nearly
came
to
blows
buffy
i
nearly
came
to
loss
of
limbs
well
i
can
be
the
one
on
her
one
let's
rephrase
i
think
she
might
listen
to
me
we
kind
of
have
um
a
connection
i'm
just
saying
it's
worth
a
shot
that's
all
yeah
but
we
hung
out
a
little
recently
and
she
seemed
to
be
um
responsive
oh
she
was
fighting
one
of
those
uh
apocalypse
demon
things
and
i
helped
her
gave
her
a
ride
home
not
extensively
no
oh
no
i
mean
why
would
i
be
offended
by
that
i
just
uh
came
by
to
see
how
you
are
actually
can
i
come
in
just
to
talk
i
promise
hey
yeah
got
me
there
pretty
much
not
gonna
try
to
take
you
under
any
circumstances
see
here
feel
that
probably
like
a
wet
noodle
to
you
huh
that's
all
i
need
for
talking
and
conversation
i'm
um
quick
as
a
bunny
it's
just
uh
i
heard
about
what
happened
and
i
thought
you
might
need
a
friend
yeah
i
heard
that
version
either
way
iit
sounds
like
it
was
an
accident
and
that's
the
important
part
faith
you
may
not
think
so
but
i
sort
of
know
you
and
i've
seen
you
postbattle
and
i
know
firsthand
that
you're
um
like
a
wild
thing
and
half
the
time
you
don't
know
what
you're
doing
see
you're
trying
to
hurt
me
but
right
now
you
need
someone
on
your
side
what
happened
wasn't
your
fault
and
i'm
willing
to
testify
to
that
in
court
if
you
need
me
no
nnnnno
that's
not
it
no
i
mean
it
was
nice
it
was
great
it
was
kind
of
a
blur
faith
come
on
i
came
here
to
help
you
i
thought
we
had
a
connection
no
no
wait
it
was
more
than
that
