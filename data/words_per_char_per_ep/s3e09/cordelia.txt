get
impaled
why
do
i
get
bitten
by
snakes
why

i
think
i've
finally
figured
it
out
what
my
problem
is
it's
buffy
summers
that's
when
all
my
troubles
started
when
she
moved
here
oh
i
just
pulled
some
stitches
last
night
know
why
surprise
it
was
buffy's
fault
yeah
i
can
use
some
luck
and
a
stick
with
pointy
sharp
bits
if
that
buffy
wasn't
i
swear
she's
a
pain
i
never
would've
looked
twice
at
xander
if
buffy
hadn't
made
him
marginally
cooler
by
hanging
with
him
yeah
i
swear
i
wish
buffy
summers
had
never
come
to
sunnydale
anya
'i
wish
buffy
summers
had
never
come
to
sunnydale'
yeah
i'll
get
back
to
you
yeah

do
i
mean
i
do
so

with
the
winter
brunch
thing

the
rush
since
when

going
out
tonight
curfew
come
on
i'm
in
a
really
good
mood
let's
go
to
the
bronze
oh
the
bronze
isn't
cool
in
this
reality
i've
gotta
make
these
little
adjustments
you're
right
i
just
well
i
bumped
my
head
yesterday
and
i
keep
forgetting
stuff
not
that
i
care
but
xander
harris
he's
miserable
right
and
that
willow
freak
he
hangs
with
not
even
a
blip
on
the
radar
screen
right
okay
not
funny
hey
you
where
did
you
put
my
car
my
auto
el
convertablo
what
what
is
this
some
kind
of
sick
joke
harmony
told
me
you
were
dead
listen
to
me
we
have
to
find
buffy
she'll
figure
out
a
way
to
save
us
she
was
supposed
to
be
here
and
as
much
as
it
kills
me
to
admit
it
things
were
better
when
she
was
around
no
buffy
the
dogfaced
girl
duh
who
do
you
think
i'm
talking
about
what's
up
with
you
two
and
the
leather
no
no
no
way
i
wish
us
into
bizarro
land
and
you
guys
are
still
together
i
cannot
win
no
giles
it's
all
my
fault
i
wasn't
i
made
this
stupid
wish
no
you
have
to
get
buffy
buffy
changes
it
it
wasn't
like
this
it
was
better
i
mean
the
clothes
alone
but
people
were
happy
mostly
and
what
what
i
wish
buffy
summers
had
never
come
to
sunnydale
that
would
be
cool
no
wait
i
wish
buffy
summers
had
never
been
born
and
i
wish
that
xander
harris
never
again
knows
the
touch
of
a
woman
and
that
willow
wakes
up
tomorrow
covered
in
monkey
hair
in
fact
i
wish
all
men
except
maybe
the
dumb
and
the
really
agreeable
kind
disappear
off
the
face
of
the
earth
that
would
be
so
