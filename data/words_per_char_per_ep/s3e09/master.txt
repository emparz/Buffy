ahh
xander
willow
hungry
i've
lost
my
appetite
for
this
one
she
keeps
looking
at
me
i'm
trying
to
eat
and
she
looks
at
me
go
on
i
remember
that
lust
for
the
kill
now
what
news
on
the
rialto
he'll
be
dealt
with
soon
enough
she
talked
of
summoning
the
slayer
here
now
at
this
time
and
you
didn't
kill
her
the
plant
begins
operation
in
less
than
twentyfour
hours
you
will
find
this
girl
you
will
kill
her
before
she
contacts
the
slayer
or
i'll
see
you
two
kissing
daylight
you
killed
the
girl
that
sought
the
slayer
excellent
the
opening
will
commence
as
scheduled
ecstatic
ooo
be
my
guest
vampires
come
behold
the
technical
wonder
which
is
about
to
alter
the
very
fabric
of
our
society
some
have
argued
that
such
an
advancement
goes
against
our
nature
they
claim
that
death
is
our
art
i
say
to
them
well
i
don't
say
anything
to
them
because
i
kill
them
undeniably
we
are
the
world's
superior
race
yet
we
have
always
been
too
parochial
too
bound
by
the
mindless
routine
of
the
predator
hunt
and
kill
hunt
and
kill
titillating
yes
bring
on
the
first
she's
still
alive
you
see
for
the
freshness
welcome
to
the
future
