so
how
come
faith
was
a
noshow
i
thought
mucusy
demons
were
her
favorites
i
detect
worry
well
burial
detail
aside
does
this
cap
us
off
for
the
day
i
cannot
stress
enough
how
much
i
don't
have
plans
i've
left
a
few
messages
sixty
seventy
but
you
know
what
really
bugs
me
okay
we
kissed
it
was
a
mistake
but
i
know
that
was
positively
the
last
time
we
were
ever
gonna
kiss
and
they
burst
in
rescuing
us
without
even
knocking
i
mean
this
is
really
all
their
fault
mine
is
much
more
advanced
right
i
mean
you
went
through
it
with
angel
and
you're
still
standing
so
tell
us
wise
one
how
do
you
deal
excuse
me
i
need
to
be
both
giving
and
receiving
of
mirth
look
you
want
to
do
guiltapalooza
fine
but
i'm
done
with
that
starting
this
minute
i'm
gonna
grab
ahold
of
that
crazy
little
thing
called
life
and
let
it
do
its
magical
little
healy
thing
what's
done
is
done
let's
be
in
the
moment
behold
the
beauty
that
is
now
who's
with
me
look
at
her
tears
of
a
clown
baby
or
is
it
grins
of
a
sad
person
or
maybe
it's
oops
sorry
but
why
'oops'
i
mean
we
always
touch
digits
it's
a
friend
thing
comfort
like
chocolate
well
whadaya
know
cordelia
chase
now
why
would
she
say
something
like
that
buffy
the
slayer
it's
not
that
i
don't
appreciate
your
appetite
will
but
i
thought
we
agreed
it
was
my
turn
probably
not
but
i'll
give
you
a
head
start

the
parts

the
white
hats

wannaslay
librarian

up
weird
thing

talking
about
buffy
'gotta

that
what
they
called
the
slayer
someone
has
to
talk
to
her
people

name
is
striking
fear
in
nobody's
hearts

too
bright
book
