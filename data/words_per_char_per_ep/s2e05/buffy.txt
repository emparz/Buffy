the
slayer
or
what
it's
like
to

fuzzy
feelings

the
undead

do
i
want
out
of
this
conversation
one
thing
already
has
led
to
another
you
think
it's
a
little
late
to
be
reading
me
a
warning
label
isn't
that
the
way
it's
supposed
to
be
no
when
you
kiss
me

ii'm
not
going
with
angel
i'm

whole
lotta

angel
angel
barely
says
two
words
to
me
and
when
he
does
he
treats
me
like
i'm
a
child
you

carry
on
a
conversation
found

it's
broken
in
two
i
don't
know
what
the
rest
of
the
letters
might
have
spelled
and
there's
blood
on
it
angel
showed
up
he
could
smell
it
uh

got
a
mountain
of
homework

probably
use
my
help

not
really
feeling
all
that
well
myself
oh
