hey
um
dawn's
kind
of
ready
to
go
can
we
take
her
with
us
what
about
you
we
can
wait
if
you
want
sure
she
does
we're
witches
we
know
stuff
you
make
a
place
for
her
in
your
heart
it's
sort
of
like
she
becomes
a
part
of
you
does
that
make
sense
okay
we
can
just

sit
or
or
whatever
you
want
of
course
you
wanna
bring
your
mother
back
and

i
wish
we
could
but
it's
not
possible
this
is
different
magic
can't
be
used
to
alter
the
natural
order
of
things
they
did
and
it's
awful
and
unfair
but
this
isn't
the
way
that's
not
the
point
because
witches
can't
be
allowed
to
alter
the
fabric
of
life
for
selfish
reasons
wiccans
took
an
oath
a
long
time
ago
to
honor
that
maybe
they
could
but
we
can't
take
care
dawn
hmm
sassy
eggs
what
are
you
writing
this
for
that's
new
down
to
every
last
bagel
huh
what
happened
to
history
of
witchcraft
dawn
must
have
taken
it
this
is
bad
this
is
really
bad
well
it's
not
a
howto
guide
but
it
refers
to
specific
resurrection
spells
and
potions
ii
don't
know
but

god
what
else
did
she
take
no
no
we
can't
waste
time
on
that
now
we
don't
know
what
she's
up
to
