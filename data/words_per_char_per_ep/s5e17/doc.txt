experience
with
uh
spells
of
this
magnitude
didn't
think
so
well
your

a
good
candidate
at
least
strong
dna
we've
got
the
ghora
demon
standing
between
you
and
success
that's
the
translation
you
were
missing
yeah
they
like
to
stick
close
to
the
hellmouth
egg
of
the
ghora
gives
life
it's
key
to
the
spell
if
it
was
as
easy
as
making
an
omelet
everyone
would
try
it
no
you
have
to
steal
the
egg
from
the
nest
of
the
demon
and
the
ghora
won't
be
happy
about
it
first
things
first
we'll
need
an
image
of
your
mother
a
photo
a
painting
once
you
get
all
the
ingredients
together
put
them
in
the
center
of
a
sacred
circle
with
the
photo
of
your
mother
then
say
this
incantation
three
times
she
won't
appear
you
know
poof
it'll
take

a
while
but
she
will
come
to
you
got
it
oh
anything
goes
wrong
the
only
way
to
reverse
the
spell

is
to
destroy
the
image
of
your
mother
understand
it's
a
tricky
spell
girl
i
can't
say
for
sure
your
mother
will
come
back
exactly
like
she
was
sometimes
these

things

get
a
little
off

or
less
