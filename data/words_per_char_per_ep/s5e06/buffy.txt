the
last
thing
we
need
we
have
to
keep
her
safe
away
where

in
spain
with
his
secretary
living
the
cliche
i
called
him
when

when
he
bailed
on
us

i
remember
dawn
cried
for
a
week

she
didn't
she
wasn't
there

i
can
still
feel
what
it

think

i
have
to
take
care
of
her
i
want
to

act
weird
around
her

come
she'll
come
for
us
you
know
what
you
guys

called
helping

going
to
break
something
it's
no
big
you
