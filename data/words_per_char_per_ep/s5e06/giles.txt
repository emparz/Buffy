uh
i
don't
know
what
to
say
she
has
no
idea
are
you
going
to
tell
her
this

woman
this
uh
whatever
she
was
she
knows
you
now
should
we
be
thinking
about

sending
dawn
away
i
don't
know
uh

your
father's
i'm
sorry
do
we
tell
the
others
yes
we
have
to
find
out
who
this
woman
is
and
what
she
needs
dawn
for
i
mean
if
she
comes
after
you
people
help
each
other
out
anya
it's
one
of
our
strange
customs
well
i
saw
myself
in
more
of
a

patriarchal
sort
of
role
you
know
lots
of
pointing
and
scowling
you
two
stop
that
stop
it
or
you're
going
to
break
something
yes
uh
we'll
we'll
uh
find
her
weaknesses
and
then
uh
could
we
please
be
a
little
less
effusive
anya
don't
want
to
frighten
the
people
yes
well
why
don't
you
start
organizing
the
shipping
orders
well
i
have
narrowed
it
down
somewhat
well
you
didn't
give
me
much
to
go
on
sheshe
looks
human
so
the
mug
shots
aren't
any
use
and
uh
you
can't
be
more
specific
about
what
she's
like
right
that
one
of
course
our
work
is
done
come
up
with
anything
yet
and
you
are
talking
about
what
on
earth
you're
in
a
magic
shop
and
you
can't
think
what
tara
would
like
i
believe
you're
both
profoundly
stupid
bloody
well
better
not
i've
got
mine
already
wrapped
uh
private
collection
uh
books
for
sale
are
against
the
walls
over
there
was
there
something
in
particular
you
were
looking
for
no
no
no
no
nothing
earthshattering
to
relate
i
just
have
a
few
thoughts
and
uh
wanted
to
make
sure
that
we
were
all
on
the
same
page
well
first
of
all
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about

safety
um
this
creature
could
be
will
be
coming
after
buffy
and
possibly
all
of
us
now
i
may
have
a
lead
on
this
monk
that
buffy
spoke
of
there
there
are
a
few
orders
that
ii've
read
up
on
ii'm
sorry
where
was
i
yes
um
i'd
like
us
all
to
start
looking
at
these
orders
iit's
possible
whichever
one
this
monk
belonged
to
was
wiped
out
entirely
certainly
not
dawn
would
you
close
the
door
under
there
go
how
many
are
there
you
cast
a
spell
on
us
to
keep
us
from
seeing
your

demon
side
that's
why
we
couldn't
see
our
attackers
and

you're
not
just
dealing
with
uh
two
little
girls
mr
maclay
i
would
say
your
business
here
is
finished
