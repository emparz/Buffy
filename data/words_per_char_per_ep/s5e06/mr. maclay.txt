well
here's
my
girl
one
of
your
dormmates
said
i
might

find
you
here
pleasure
well
i
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
your
plans
i
know
we've
come
on
you
kind
of
suddenly
but
i
thought
we
could
have
dinner
why
don't
i
pick
you
up
at
six
and
we'll

do
some
catching
up
forgive
me
for
running
out
we're
doubleparked
the
door
wasn't
locked
i
was
a
little
early
i
suppose
you

wanted
me
to
see
all
these

toys
you
don't
even
try
to
hide
it
anymore
i'd
hoped
maybe
you'd
gotten
over
the
whole
witchcraft
thing
that
if
we
let
you
go
you'd

get
it
out
of
your
system
then
they
told
me
to
look
for
you
in

that
store
of
course
we
came
we
haven't
heard
from
you
in
months
your
birthday's
getting
closer
and
closer
you
know
what
that
means
are
you
lying
to
me
tara
you're
coming
home
with
us
you
know
it's
the
only
way
you
can't
control
what's
going
to
happen
you
have
evil
inside
of
you
and
it
will
come
out
and
letting
yourself
work
all
this
magic
is
only
going
to
make
it
worse
where
do
you
think
that
power
comes
from
evil
never
does
i
don't
feel
much
like
eating
right
now
i'll
give
you
some
time
but
we
need
to
be
gone
by
morning
your
family
loves
you
tara
no
matter
what
how
do
you
think
your
friends
are
going
to
feel
when
they
see
your
true
face
tara
what
in
god's
name
is
that
i
don't
understand
demon
the
women
in
our
family
have
demon
in
them
her
mother
had
it
that's
where
the
magic
comes
from
we
came
to
take
her
home
before
well
before
things
like

this
started
happening
the
camper's
outside
that's
not
the
point
and
it's
not
your
concern
she
belongs
with
us
we
know
how
to
control
her

problem
it's
not
your
decision

lady
you're
going
to
do
what's
right

i'm
taking
you
out
of

clear
to
the
rest
of
you

a
joke

be
threatened
by
two
little
