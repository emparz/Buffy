a
little
strong
but
he
does
have
a
point
you
know
for
the
last
two
years
more
email
was
sent
than
regular
mail
more
digitized
information
went
across
phone
lines
than
conversation
i'll
bet
it
is
alright

wrap
it
up
for
today
cool
thanks
did
you
ever
leave
morning

nice
short
visit
okay
hey
fritz
i'm
uh
lookin'
at
the
logs
you
and
dave
are
clockin'
a
pretty
scary
amount
of
computer
time
ooo
will
i
be
excited
i
just
came
by
to
check
your
new
data
base
make
sure
your
cross
reference
table
isn't
glitching
'cause
i'm
guessing
you
haven't
gone
anywhere
near
it
hmm
you're
here
again
kids
really
dig
the
library
don't
cha
you're
a
snob
oh
you
are
a
big
snob
you
you
think
that
knowledge
should
be
kept
in
these
carefully
guarded
repositories
where
only
a
handful
of
white
guys
can
get
at
it
this
isn't
a
fad
rupert
we
are
creating
a
new
society
here
well
i
think
you'll
be
very
happy
here
with
your
musty
old
books
hmm
this
one
doesn't
have
a
whole
lot
more
to
say
what
is
it
like
a
diary
what
is
it
we
were
fighting
hi
i
got
your
message
what's
so
urgent
i
know
come
on
there've
been
portents
for
days
i
mean
power
surges
online
shutdowns
you
should
see
the
bones
i've
been
casting
i
knew
this
would
happen
sooner
or
later
i
mean
it's
probably
a
a
mischief
demon
y'know
like
kelkor
or
the
corrupter
oh
boy
i
shoulda
remembered
i
just
don't
i
teach
computer
science
at
the
local
high
school
wrong
and
wrong
snobby
you
think
the
realm
of
the
mystical
is
limited
to
ancient
texts
and
relics
that
bad
old
science
made
the
magic
go
away
mm
the
divine
exists
in
cyberspace
same
as
out
here
mm
i
don't
have
that
kinda
power
'technopagan'
is
the
term
there
are
more
of
us
than
you
think
well
i
can
help
i
think
i
hope
i
mean

is
my
first
real

you
want
him

to
do
is
form
the
circle
of
kayless

have
to
form
the
circle
inside

putting
out
a
flash
i
just
hope
enough
of
my
group

betting
he

figure
out
what
we're
doing
until

too
late
