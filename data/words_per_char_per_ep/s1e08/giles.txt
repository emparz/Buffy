oh
uh
i
uh
haven't
gone
through
the
new
arrivals
uh
put
it
in
uh
in
in
that
pile
uh
when
i've
examined
it
you
can
uh
uh
skim
it
of
course
ms
calendar
i'm
sure
your
computer
science
class
is
fascinating
but
i
happen
to
believe
that
one
can
survive
in
modern
society
without
being
a
slave
to
the
um
idiot
box
i
still
prefer
a
good
book
oh
that
is
a
fact
that
i
regard
with
genuine
horror
i'm
i'm
just
gonna
stay
and
clean
up
a
little
i'll
uh
i'll
be
back
in
the
middle
ages
those
boys
aren't
sparklingly
normal
as
it
is
ii
do
iii
really
don't
know
how
to
advise
you
things
involved
with
a
computer
fill
me
with
a
childlike
terror
now
if
it
were
a
nice
ogre
or
some
such
i'd
be
more
in
my
element
well
ii
suppose
you
could
um
tail
dave
see
if
he's
up
to
something
what
was
the
name
of
this
place
well
itit's
just
somewhat
unprecedented
we
still
don't
know
an
enormous
amount
whatever
is
going
on
there
may
be
on
the
upandup
your
spider
sense
yes
well
i
think
we're
still
at
a
stand
still
uh
uh
short
of
breaking
into
the
place
i
don't
see
a
moment
please
of
quiet
reflection
i
do
not
suggest
that
you
illegally
enter
the
data
into
the
file
so
the
book
will
be
listed
by
title
as
well
as
by
author
uh
i'm
still
sorting
through
the
chaos
you
left
behind
you
uh
wwe'll
uh
continue
this
conversation
at
another
time
i
am
no
such
thing
nonsense
i
simply
don't
adhere
to
a
a
kneejerk
assumption
that
because
something
is
new
it's
better
a
society
in
which
human
interaction
is
all
but
obsolete
in
which
people
can
be
completely
manipulated
by
technology
well
well
thank
you
i'll
pass
these
musty
old
books
have
a
great
deal
more
to
say
than
in
any
of
your
fabulous
web
pages
how
odd
i
haven't
looked
through
all
the
volumes
yet
i
didn't
um
uh
nothing
um
a
a
diary
yes
i
imagine
that's
what
it
is
well
it's
been
so
nice
talking
to
you
must
do
it
again
sometime
yes
bye
now
she
was
only
grounded
for
a
moment
still
if
you'd
been
anyone
but
the
slayer
uh
oh
yes
i
think
perhaps
i
do
does
this
look
familiar
to
either
of
you
in
the
dark
ages
the
souls
of
demons
were
sometimes
trapped
in
certain
volumes
they
remained
locked
within
the
book
harmless
unless
the
pages
were
read
aloud
unless
i'm
mistaken
this
is
moloch
the
corrupter
a
very
deadly
and
seductive
demon
he
draws
people
to
him
with
promises
of
love
power
knowledge
preys
on
impressionable
minds
dave
and
who
knows
how
many
others
not
anymore
i
didn't
read
it
that
dreadful
calendar
woman
found
it
and
and
it
was
already
blank
i
don't
know
and
i
don't
know
who
could've
read
that
book
it
wasn't
even
in
english
uh
in
a
pile
with
others
that
were
um
uh
scanned
the
scanner
read
the
book
it
brought
moloch
out
as
information
to
be
absorbed
he's
everywhere
willow
scanned
him
into
her
file
it
may
be
a
futile
gesture
but
i
suggest
we
um
uh
delete
it
this
is
very
bad
randomize
traffic
signals
destroy
the
world's
economy
right
yours
was
best
damn
it
what
did
you
find
how
i
i
have
records
of
the
ceremonies
but
but
that's
for
a
creature
of
the
flesh
ththis
could
be
something
completely
different
well
even
if
she
could
how
am
i
gonna
convince
her
that
there's
a
demon
on
the
internet
binding
rituals
um
thank
you
for
coming
uh
i
need
your
help
but
before
that
um
i
need
you
to
believe
something
that
um
you
may
not
want
to
uh
there's
uh
something's
got
into
the
um
iiinside
um
there's
a
demon
in
the
internet
you
already
know
how
exactly
is
that
it's
moloch
uh
you
don't
seem
exactly
surprised
by
who
are
you
a
profession
that
hardly
lends
itself
to
the
casting
of
bones
are
you
a
witch
well
uh
you
can
definitely
help
me
um
what's
in
cyberspace
at
the
moment
is
less
than
divine
i
have
the
binding
rituals
at
hand
but
i'm
completely
out
of
my
idiom
he
was
uh
'scanned'
is
the
term
i
believe
buffy
willow
where
are
you
ms
calendar
and
i
are
uh
working
to
get
moloch
offline
form
a
circle
but
there's
only
two
of
us
that's
really
more
of
a
line
won't
moloch
just
shut
you
down
hoping
and
betting
that's
what
we've
got
couldn't
you
just
stop
moloch
by
by
entering
some
computer
virus
uh
i
am
by
the
power
of
the
divine
by
the
essence
of
the
word
i
command
you
by
the
power
of
the
circle
of
kayless
i
command
you
kayless
with
a
'k'
demon
come
i
command
you
demon
come
he's
not
in
the
book
i'm
remaining
calm
thank
you
uh
i
just
wanted
to
uh
return
this
i
found
it
among
the
new
books
and
naturally
i
thought
of
you
uh
well
i'll
i'll
see
you
anon
truthfully
i'm
even
less
anxious
to
be
around
computers
than
i
used
to
be
the
smell
i
know
smell
is
the
most
powerful
trigger
to
the
memory
there
is
a
certain
flower
or
a
a
whiff
of
smoke
can
bring
up
experiences
long
forgotten
books
smell
musty
and
and
and
and
rich
the
knowledge
gained
from
a
computer
is
uh
it
it
has
no
no
texture
no
no
context
it's
it's
there
and
then
it's
gone
if
it's
to
last
then
then
the
getting
of
knowledge
should
be
uh
tangible
it
should
be
um
smelly
well
ii
don't
dangle
a
corkscrew
from
my
ear
