oh
will
you
stop
whining
about
that
hey
i'm
glad
he
did
this
is
the
best
thing
that's
ever
happened
to
me
you
know
it
wasn't
that
bad
it
was
like
a
sharp
pain
then
a
burning
then
a
general
queasiness
it's
kinda
like
when
i
used
to
get
ulcers
in
high
school
only
at
the
end
i
became
one
with
light
and
hope
hey
this
isn't
your
fault
ok
it's
my
fault
the
ritual
didn't
work
i
screwed
up
i'm
littleâ€”ii
don't
have
as
much
blood
as
other
people
and
i
probably
should've
told
someone
i
was
anemic
don't
worry
we're
gonna
fix
it
you
gotta
trust
us
we
know
what
we're
doing
ok
calm
down
we
can
work
around
that
