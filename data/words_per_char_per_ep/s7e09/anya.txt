the
chest

evil
faction
fine
you
guys
keep
your
heads
buried
in

should
prepare
ourselves
for
the
possibility
that
william

bloody

it
new
you
think
this
is
a
game

in
danger

to
waste
time
on
deceptions

on
my
watch

you
see
that
i
actually
made
him
cry
no
you
were
great
and
i
wasn't
sure
if
i
should
slap
him
but
then
he
made
me
want
to
slap
him
so
i
thought
ok
slap
him
so
what
do
we
do
now
right
what's
the
status
with
your
guy
the
weasel
wants
to
sing
he
just
needs
a
tune

lying
son
of
a
bitch
you're
gonna
tell
us

gonna
tell
us
right
