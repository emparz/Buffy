don't
make
it
tighter—the
knots'll
give
i
get
free
someone's
gonna
die
i
think
you
should
probably
go—
i
don't
remember
anything
no
not
that
i
don't
remember
what
i
did
it's
all
flashes
here
and
there
it's
like
i'm
watching
someone
elsedo
it
kill
people
i've
been
losing
time
for
a
while
now
waking
up
in
strange
places
i
wasn't
aware
that
it
had
you
know
not
'til
now
oh
things
have
been
wonky
since
i
got
back
ever
since—
figured
that's
what
it
was
like
it'd
been
so
long
since
i
had
one
saw
a
man
about
a
girl
i
went
to
seek
a
legend
out
traveled
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
made
a
deal
with
a
demon
no
not
just
like
that
there
was
a
price
there
were
trials
torture
pain
and
suffering
of
sorts
well
it's
all
relative
isn't
it
meaning
i
have
come
to
redefine
the
words
pain
and
suffering
since
i
fell
in
love
with
you
apparently
i
just
slaughtered
half
of
sunnydale
pet
i'm
not
really
worried
about
being
polite
anymore
i'm
feeling
honest
with
myself
you
used
me
you
told
me
that
of
course
i
never
understood
it
though
not
until
now
you
hated
yourself
and
you
took
it
out
on
me
soul's
not
all
about
moonbeams
and
pennywhistles
luv
it's
about
selfloathing
i
get
it
had
to
travel
'round
the
world
but
i
understand
you
now
i
understand
the
violence
inside
not
the
same
as
bad
as
i
was
as
evil
and
as
wretched
as
i
was
i
never
truly
hated
myself
back
then
not
like
i
do
now
what's
that
nobody
i
was
just
uh
keeping
myself
company
fine
how
are
you
i'm
fine
buffy
really
i'm
justfeeling
a
bit
peckish
i
suppose
do
you
mind
did
i
hurt
anybody
who
oh
i
don't
remember
buffy
i
don't
know
why
kill
me
buffy
you
have
to
kill
me
do
you
have
any
idea
what
i'm
capable
of
i'm
not
talking
about
the
cellar
the
people
in
the
cellar
got
off
easy
i'm
talking
about
me
buffy
you
have
never
met
the
real
me
no
you
got
off
easy
too
do
you
know
how
much
blood
you
can
drink
from
a
girl
before
she'll
die
i
do
you
see
the
trick
is
to
drink
just
enough
to
know
how
to
damage
them
just
enough
so
that
they'll
still
cry
when
you—
'cause
it's
not
worth
it
if
they
don't
cry
i
already
did
it
it's
already
done
you
wanna
know
what
i've
done
to
girls
dawn's
age
this
is
me
buffy
you've
got
to
kill
me
before
i
get
out
have
you
ever
really
asked
yourself
why
you
can't
do
it
off
me
after
everything
i've
done
to
you
to
people
around
you
it's
not
love
we
both
know
that
don't
do
that
don't
rationalize
this
into
some
noble
act
we
both
know
the
truth
of
it
you
like
men
who
hurt
you
you
need
the
pain
we
cause
you
you
need
the
hate
you
need
it
to
do
your
job
to
be
the
slayer
there's
no
one
else
window
dressing
buffy
oh
oh
oh
