spike
is
being
strapped
to

of

while
a

person
a

of
the

also
known
as
a

straps

spike
grins
wickedly
fondly
eyeing
spike's
predicament
spike
is
tied
to
the
wheellike
construct
with
all
four
corners
of
his
body
pulled
in

directions
a

takes
out
a

tied

spike
is
now
hanging
from
the
wheel
about
ten
feet
from
the
ground
bleeding
steadily
from
his
ritualized
symbolshaped
cuts
spike's
blood
is
falling
on
the
seal
of
danthazar
that's
right
below
him
it's
pooling
in
the
grooves
and
being
absorbed
into
the
seal
the
seal
starts
to
glow
one

the
pointed
tips
of
the
pentagram
at
its

fold
up
forming
a
pyramid
light
comes
out

the
pyramid
sinks
into

the

of
the
seal
follow
suit
spike
glares
at

then
watches
the
hole
where
the
seal
is
something
sticks
it's
withered
gray
pointyfingered
hand
out
of
the
hole
a
monster
climbs
out
wearing
black
leather
pan
up
to
show
its
horrible
disfigured
face
it's
bald
with
a
distinct
vampire
forehead
and
brows
and
trademark
fanged
teeth
it
looks
gaunt
with
extremely
hollow
cheekbones
it
raises
its
hands
toward
the

and
looks
around
the

growling
menacingly
