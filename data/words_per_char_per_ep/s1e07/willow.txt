ah
the
fumigation
party
it's
an
annual
tradition
the
closing
of
the
bronze
for
a
few
days
to
nuke
the
cockroaches
it's
a
lot
of
fun
what's
it
like
where
you
are
so
we're
talking
about
a
guy
you
lack
a
guy
what
about
angel
oh
yeah
just
sitting
here
watching
our
barren
lives
pass
us
by
oh
look
a
cockroach
oh
don't
go
want
a
free
drink
that
is
so
romantic
did
you
uh
i
mean
did
he
uh
it
was
pretty
impressive
although
later
there
was
an
ick
factor
how
is
it
you
always
know
this
stuff
you
always
know
what's
going
on
i
never
know
what's
going
on
no
i
was
sleeping
angel's
a
vampire
so
that'd
be
a
no
huh
that
musta
been
so
embarrassing
when
you
thought
he
had
read
your
diary
but
then
it
turned
out
he
hadn't
but
then
he
felt
the
same
way
i'm
listening
so
angel's
been
around
for
a
while
so
he
is
a
good
vampire
i
mean
on
a
scale
of
one
to
ten
ten
being
someone
who's
killing
and
maiming
every
night
and
one
being
someone
who's
not
okay
so
let's
review
reconstruction
began
when
buffy
after
the
destruction
of
the
civil
war
are
we
gonna
talk
about
boys
or
are
we
gonna
help
you
pass
history
sometimes
i
have
this
fantasy
that
xander's
just
gonna
grab
me
and
kiss
me
right
on
the
lips
no
no
no
no
no
speaking
up
that
way
leads
to
madness
and
sweaty
palms
okay
so
here's
something
i
gotta
know
when
angel
kissed
you
i
mean
before
he
turned
into
how
was
it
wow
and
it
is
kinda
novel
how
he'll
stay
young
and
handsome
forever
although
you'll
still
get
wrinkly
and
die
and
oh
and
what
about
the
children
i'll
be
quiet
now
so
that
you
can
okay
the
era
of
the
congressional
reconstruction
usually
called
radical
what
happened
if
you
care
about
somebody
you
care
about
them
you
can't
change
that
by
we're
near
the
bronze
what
now
buffy
it
wasn't
angel
who
attacked
your
mom
it
was
darla
so
no
word
from
angel
well
in
a
way
he
sort
of
is
in
the
way
of
that
he's
right
over
there
nothin'
