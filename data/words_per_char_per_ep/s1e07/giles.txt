can
we
steer
this
riveting
conversation
back
to
the
events
that
happened
earlier
in
the
evening
you
left
the
bronze
and
were
set
upon
by
three
unusually
virile
vampires
did
they
look
like
this
it
seems
you
encountered
the
three
warrior
vampires
very
proud
and
very
strong
well
you
weren't
here
from
midnight
until
six
researching
it
uh
oobviously
you're
hurting
the
master
very
much
he
he
wouldn't
send
the
the
three
for
just
anyone
we
must
step
up
our
training
with
weapons
angel
and
buffy
are
are
not
in
any
immediate
jeopardy
um
nothing
the
crossbow
comes
later
you
must
first
become
proficient
with
the
basic
tools
of
combat
and
let's
begin
with
the
quarterstaff
which
incidentally
will
uh
require
countless
hours
of
vigorous
training
i
speak
from
experience
you
never
know
with
whom
or
what
you'll
be
fighting
and
these
traditions
have
been
handed
down
through
the
ages
now
you
show
me
good
steady
progress
with
the
quarterstaff
and
in
due
course
we'll
discuss
the
crossbow
put
on
your
pads
well
we'll
see
about
that
en
garde
good
let's
move
on
to
the
crossbow
a
vampire
isn't
a
person
at
all
it
may
have
the
movements
the
the
memories
even
the
personality
of
the
person
that
it
took
over
but
iit's
still
a
demon
at
the
core
there
is
no
halfway
uh
it
is
a
slayer's
duty
here's
something
at
last
there's
nothing
about
angel
in
the
texts
but
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
it's
been
ages
since
i've
read
the
diaries
of
any
of
the
watchers
before
me
there's
mention
some
two
hundred
years
ago
in
ireland
of
of
angelus
the
one
with
the
angelic
face
does
this
uh
angel
have
um
a
tattoo
behind
his
right
shoulder
not
long
for
a
vampire
uh
two
hundred
and
forty
years
or
so
angelus
leaves
ireland
uh
wreaks
havoc
in
in
europe
for
uh
several
decades
and
then
um
about
eighty
years
ago
the
most
curious
thing
happens
he
he
comes
to
uh
to
america
um
shuns
other
vampires
and
and
lives
alone
there's
there's
no
no
record
of
him
hunting
here
i
say
that
there's
no
record
but
uh
vampires
hunt
and
kill
it's
it's
what
they
do
uh
like
all
of
them
uh
a
vicious
violent
animal
uh
ii
just
came
to
pay
my
respects
wish
you
a
speedy
recovery
a
little
low
it
presents
itself
like
mild
anemia
uh
you
you
were
uh
lucky
you
got
to
her
as
soon
as
you
did
buffy
this
is
no
ordinary
vampire
if
there
is
such
a
thing
now
he
knows
you
he
he's
faced
the
three
i
think
this
is
gonna
take
more
than
a
simple
stake
she
makes
quite
an
impression
herself
she
lives
very
much
in
the
now
um
and
uh
history
of
course
is
is
very
much
about
the
uh
the
then
bbbut
there's
no
reason
darla
iii
don't
believe
i
know
uh
darla
came
to
your
house
tonight
shshe's
the
friend
that
you
mentioned
earlier
yes
someone
should
right
away
i'll
do
it
we
have
a
problem
keep
looking
for
her
