very
very
old
and
it's

just
don't
think
he
did
i
met
him
outside
last
night
and
then
i
went
back
where
we
met
and
it
looked
there
had
been
a
struggle
and
we
need
to
stop
this
and
eddie's

be
keeping
it
somewhere
on
campus
or
at
least
near
by
uhh
they
weren't
too
common
before
'82
'psi
theta

at

you
don't
want
to
touch
that
you
want
to
know
the
truth
i
only
need
one
when
you
look
back
at
this
in
the
three
seconds

take
you
to
turn
to
dust

think
you'll
find
the
mistake
was
touching
my
stuff

me
answer
that
with
a
headbutt

for
the
record
the
arm

can
handle
at
least
i
know
what
to
expect
