i
think
we've
just
put
our
finger
on
why
we're
the
sidekicks
game
over
ignis
incende
it's
no
big
you
just
have
to
balance
the
elements
so
when
you
affect
one
you
don't
wind
up
causing
i
didn't
do
it
i
didn't
do
it
there
you
go
all
set
just
call
me
the
computer
whisperer
let's
get
scannin'
i
want
to
see
this
puppy
go
start
where
is
finish
but

now
doesn't
winter
seem
more
like
archiving
season
no
it's
fine
it's
just
you've
been
mr
project
all
summer
you
know
labeling
the
amulets
and
indexing
your
diaries
i
draw
the
line
at
making
giant
rubber
band
balls
that's
when
you'll
just
have
to
get
a
life
it
might
go
better
if
you
left
the
house
uhoh
oh
god
well
i
guess
now
that
i
know
there's
something
to
know
i
can't
not
know
just
because
i'm
afraid
somebody'll
know
i
know
you
know
yeah
you're

what
but
you
can't
you're

buffy's
watcher
i
mean
in
a
fired
way
but
but
what
about
the
rest
of
us
we
still
need
to
be
watched
personally
i
can't
get
through
a
day
without
a
little
hairy
eyeball
when
are
you
gonna
tell
buffy
xand

what
if
somebody
had
a
secret
and
that
somebody
promised
somebody
else
that
they
wouldn't
tell
anyone
no
thithis
isn't
about
me
and
tara
sorry
this
is
of
the
nonnaughty
variety
and
i'm
not
telling
you
sure
so
if
i
was
gonna
tell
you
which
i'm
not
going
to
you
look
like
you
just
buffy
get
out
of
here
now
hi
and
then
he
lunges
at
us
like
whoosh
sexy
i
bet
he
made
it
sound
sexy
oh
no
he
he
was

yuck
no
big
whoop
what
about
that
thing
where
he
turned
himself
into
a
bat
that
was
awesome
me
too
the
whole
time
i
was
thinking
'gosh
i
wish
giles
were
here
he'd
know
what
to
do'
giles
smiles
tolerantly
he
knows
what
she's
trying
to
do
didn't
you
guys

think
that
great
point
that
is
so
giles
to
think
of
something
like
that
you
know
that
that
we

would
have
never
well
i
think
we
have
dracula
factoids
a
lot
of
it
we
already
knew
turnoffs
wood
fire
crosses
garlic
turnons
nice
duds
minions
long
slow
bites
that
last
for
days
actually
my
research
backs
riley
up
drac
isn't
the
laylow
type
only
because
you
gave
me
super
pointers
i
never
would
have
ok
dracula's
modus
operandi
is
different
from
other
vampires
he
will
kill
just
to
feed
but
he'd
rather
have
a
connection
with
his
victims
and
he
has
all
of
these
mental
powers
to
draw
them
in
he
he
can
read
and
control
minds
appear
in
dreams
makes
sense
that
stare

he
just
kinda

looked
right
through
you
didn't
you
feel
it
buffy
two
deep
puncturey
scratches
got
it
how'd
he
get
inside
anyway
a
good
sunnydale
rule
of
thumb
avoid
whiteskinned
men
in
capes
