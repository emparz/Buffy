really
care
what
time
it

you

dinner
bell
you
know
maybe
we
should
make
a
regular
date
of
this
when
school
starts
i'm
sorry
duty
calls
it's
a
total
drag
that
was
no
hunt
that
was
just
another
day
on
the
job
care
to
step
up
for
some
overtime
do
you
know
what
a
slayer
is
who
are
you
get
out
so
lemme
get
this
straight
you're

dracula
the
guy
the
count
and
you're
sure
this
isn't
just
some
fanboy
thing
cause

i've
fought
more
than
a
couple
of
pimply
overweight
vamps
that
called
themselves
lestat
you're
heard
of
me
naw
really
yeah
i
prefer
the
term
slayer
you
know
killer
just
sounds
so
like
i

paint
clowns
or
something
i'm
the
good
guy
remember
no
you
know
what
i
feel
bored
okay
that's
cheating
get
out
of
here
now
behind
you
xander
i'm
pretty
sure
that's
dracula
bat
ooh
bat
i
told
you
he'd
heard
of
me
right
i
mean
can
you
believe
that
count
famous
heard
of
me
i'm
sorry
am
i
repeatogirl
i
was
just

blown
away
i
guess
just

the
way
he
said
it
you
know
i
mean
he
made
it
sound
so
kinda
he
of
the
dark
penetrating
eyes
and
lilty
accent
actually
i
was
more
thinking
'bat'
so
we
should
take
things
slow
with
dracula
i
mean
he
said
that
we
would
meet
again
but
i
would
like
to
avoid
that
until
we
do
some
serious
homework
so
we
hold
off
no
killing
until
we
know
exactly
what
we're
dealing
with
noooo
his
eyes
were

there
were

there
was
no
penetration
cross
my
heart
we
might
not
be
as
fast
but
we'll
find
him
you
guys
we'll
reconvene
here
in
the
morning
big
sleep
my
count
encounter
wiped
me
out
you
sure
i
mean
maybe
if
you
just
lie
down
with
me
i
guess
you're
right
i'll
see
you
in
the
morning
mm
heaven
see
a
little
sugar
and
i'm
all
yours
dracula
schmacula
i
bet
you
say
that
before
you
bite
all
the
girls
kindred
hardly
i
you
think
you
can
just
waft
in
here
with
your
music
video
wind
and
your
hypnoeyes
he
was
no
no
yeah
we'll
check
all
the
swanky
places
first
what
else

i
am
not
under
the
thrall
of
the
dark
prince
oh

is
ridiculous
i'm
not
sure
why
i
tried
to
hide
it
uh
there
was
just
this
voice
and
it
was
it
was
telling
me
to
cover
it
but
it
does
seem
like
he
has
this

control
over
me
i

even
though
a
big
part
of
me
is
resisting
i
am
not
transfery
i
swear
to
you

your
girl

i'm
gonna
stay
that
way
i
can't
go
home
he
already
got
inside
once
take
me
to
him

because
i'm
under
your
thrall
well
guess
again
pal
okay
right
that

was
not

you
i
did
that
i
did
that
because

i
wanted
to
maybe
i
should
rethink
that
thrall
thing
stay
away
from
me
no
last
night

it's
not
gonna
happen
again
i
any
minute
now
'cause

need
to
know
i
won't
let
you
what

you
if
i
drink
that
i'm
not
hungry
wow
that
was
gross
looks
like
you
know
i
really
think
the
thrall
has
gone
out
of
our
relationship
but
i
want
to
thank
you
for
opening
up
my
eyes
a
little
my
true
nature
you

thanks
ooh

i
rate
the
little
cookie
treatment
actually
i
have
something
that
i'd
like
to
talk
to
you
about
too
no
go
ahead
you
haven't
been
my
watcher
for
a
while
i
haven't
been
training

and
i
haven't
really
needed
to
come
to
you
for
help
and
then
this
whole
thing
with
dracula

it
made
me
face
up
to
some
stuff
ever
since
we
did
that
spell
where
we
called
on
the
first
slayer

i've
been
going
out
a
lot
every
night
hunting
that's

what
dracula
called
it
and
he
was
right
he
understood
my
power
better
than
i
do
he
saw
darkness
in
it
i
need
to
know
more
about
where
i
come
from
about
the
other
slayers
i
mean
maybe

maybe
if
i
could
learn
to
control
this
thing
i
could
be
stronger
i
could
be
better
but

i'm
scared
i
know
it's
gonna
be
hard
and
i
can't
do
it

without
you
i
need
your
help
i
need
you
to
be
my
watcher
again
boy

just
i
just
keep
talking

i
i'm
sorry
youyou

something
