thank
you
willow
obstinate
bloody
machine
simply
refused
to
work
for
me
start
with
those
willow
it's
essential
that
we
begin
archiving
the
library
i
mean
most
of
these
texts
have
no
duplicates
well
you
don't
have
to
willow
i
mean
you're
you're
welcome
to
leave
if
uh
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
do
actually
is
um
get
a
life
willow
um
you
mustn't
repeat
what
i'm
about
to
say
especially
not
to
buffy
you
promise
did
that
mean
yes
we're
doing
all
this
because
i
i
want
you
and
the
others
to
have
everything
you
need
at
your
fingertips
you
see
i'm
i'm
going
back
to
england
well
it's
become
quite
obvious
that
buffy
doesn't
need
me
ii
don't
say
that
in
a
selfpitying
way
i'm
i'm
quite
proud
actually
i
appreciate
the
sentiment
but
it's
it's
just
not
so
you'll
be
fine
you
all
will
and
you
know
we'll
we'll
stay
in
touch
you
can
always
call
me
whenever
you
like
soon
it
won't
be
easy
but
um
i
know
she'll
understand
it
must
have
been
yes
i
must
admit
i'm
sorry
i
missed
that
i
i
have
no
idea
there's
a
great
deal
of
myth
about
dracula
i
imagine
the
trick
to
defeating
him
lies
in
separating
the
fact
from
the
fiction
all
right
willow
you
and
tara
find
out
everything
you
can
about
the
actual
legend
of
vlad
the
impaler
on
the
internet
and
uh
i'll
check
the
library
so
we
can
uh
check
out
the
nicer
places
don't
you
think
buffy
buffy
well
willow
has
most
of
it
actually
just
go
ahead
willow
the
point
is
though
he
goes
through
the
motions
of
an
intimate
seduction
the
end
result
is
the
same
he
turns
them
into
a
vampire
um

just
be
aware
that
he
he
tends
to
form
a
relationship
with
his
prey
it's
not
enough
for
him
to
take
her
she
must
want
to
be
taken
she
must

burn
for
him
why
didn't
you
say
anything
uh
riley's
right
you
should

you
should
stay
out
of
sight
let
the
rest
of
us
look
for
dracula
good
um
riley
and
i
can
uh
can
search
for
dracula
and
willow
you
and
tara
could
uh
could
do
a
protection
spell
on
buffy's
mother's
house
and
prevent
him
from
returning
and
it's
getting
dark
i
should
have
turned
up
a
better
lead
there
must
be
an
easier
way
to
find
him
uh
a
castle
oh
good
show
giles
uhh
at
least
you
didn't
get
knocked
out
for
a
change
oh

would

be
the
three
sisters
