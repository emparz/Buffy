i'm
exhausted
just
looking
at
those
two
all
the
splashing
and
jumping
and
running
shouldn't
relaxing
involve
less
exertion
the
uh
fire's
not
cooperating
it's
comforting
to
know
that
i
lack
the
culinary
finesse
of
a
caveman
news
flash
will
everybody
knows
oh
well
not
that
i
wouldn't
be
all
ears
if
you
wanted
to
tell
me
a
secret
about
you
two
even
if
it
was
very
very
naughty
okay
want
to
see
if
buffy's
hanging
around
the
headstones
hey
buff
what's
up
fine
but
i
was
gonna
give
you
a
sip
of
my
doublemint
mocha
but
nice
look
who's
got
a
bad
case
of
dark
prince
envy
no
we're
not
going
to
leave
you
and
where'd
you
get
that
accent
sesame
street
vun
two
three

three
victims
mwa
ha
ha
wow
really
hey
sorry
man
i
was

just
jokin'
around
and
then
frigging
dracula's
standing
right
behind
us
he
totally
looked
shorter
in
person
how
would
you
know
please
he
was
no
big
whoop
how
come
he
can
do
that
second
adorable
or
better
yet
why
don't
you
just
go
sit
on
top
of
a
crypt
and
flaunt
your
neck
cleavage
until
dracula
shows
up
then
you
two
can
talk
private
oh
no
just
because
you're
panting
over
the
guy
you
don't
wanna
come
back
to
my
place
fine
i
suppose
dracula
doesn't
use
bleach
huh
he's
a
darksonly
man
great
perfect
you
know
what
you're
not
so
big
one
round
of
oldfashioned
fisticuffs
you'd
fold
like
a
bitty
baby
okay
let's
do
it
and
no
poofing
come
on
puffy
shirt
pucker
on
up
'cause
you
can
kiss
your
pale
ass
dracula
silence
yes
master
no
that's
not
dracula
you
will
be
my
emissary
my
eyes
and
ears
in
daylight
your
emissary
blood
yes
yes
i
will
serve
you
your
excellent
spookiness
or
master
i'll
just
stick
with
master
but
master
how
can
i
find
brilliant
what
an
exit
guy's
a
genius
got
it
got
it
mine
mine
like
any
of
that's
enough
to
fight
the
dark
master
bator
ah
but
he's
smart
enough
to
figure
that
we
probably
already
know
that
i'm
guessing
he's
lying
low
see
buffy
didn't
feel
it
i
think
you're
drawing
a
low
of
crazy
conclusions
about
the
unholy
prince
bator
well
that
is
intimate
dracula's
gifting
these
ladies
with
his
own
blood
and
blood

blood
is
life
according
to
them
'cause
she
didn't
want
to
worry
us
right
buffster
it's
nothin'
just
a
scratch
you're
saying
dracula
has
some
sort
of
freaky
mind
control
over
her
you're
watching
too
many
creature
features
man
you
can
come
over
to
my
place
i'll
make
sure
you
stay
put
i'm
supposed
to
deliver
you
to
the
master
now
there's
this
whole
deal
where
i
get
to
be
immortal
you
cool
with
that
master
i
deliver
the
slayer
she
who
you
most
desire
sorry
whom
so
now
comes
the
immortality
right
you
do
the
thing
and
dracula
leave
us
you
bet
nobody
harms
my
master
you
want
him
you
come
through
me
where
is
he
where's
the
creep
that
turned
me
into
his
spidereating
manbitch
dammit
you
know
what
i'm
sick
of
this
crap
i'm
sick
of
being
the
guy
who
eats
insects
and
gets
the
funny
syphilis
as
of
this
moment
it's
over
i'm
finished
being
everybody's
buttmonkey
