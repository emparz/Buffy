anybody
ever
tell
team
you
the
quarterback
throws
like
a
girl
uh
buffy
slayed
the
football
yeah
man
i'm
starving
cow
me
i
couldn't
believe
it
the
first
twenty
times
you
told
us
but
it's
starting
to
sink
in
now
it's
not
that
surprising
that
he's
heard
of
you
buffy
you
are
the
slayer
i
don't
know
i
mean
he
may
have
a
bunch
of
swell
party
tricks
but
he's
still
just
a
vampire
i
say
we
load
up
with
stakes
and
crossbows
and
go
after
him
now
you're
not
just
saying
that
because
of
those
dark
penetrating
eyes
of
his
are
you
if
the
initiative
was
still
around
we'd
be
able
to
find
everything
on
this
guy
in
a
few
hours
what's
your
plan
i'm
kinda
wired
maybe
i
should
just
let
you
get
your
rest
nothing
you
are
about
to
say
will
lead
to
rest
mmhmm
with
donuts
i'd
put
that
down
unless
you're
bucking
for
one
hell
of
a
headache
i'm
looking
for
some
information
might
pay
a
little
what
can
you
tell
me
about
dracula
you
know
him
but
he's
not
just
a
regular
vampire
i
mean
he
has
special
powers
right
he's
in
town
making
his
presence
known
actually
he's
gunning
for
buffy
but
i'm
out
to
find
him
before
he
gets
another
shot
at
her
so
you're
saying
i
should
check
out
mansions
that
sort
of
thing
you've
helped
buffy
before
so
she
has
a
problem
with
killing
you
now
that
you're
helpless
i
don't
would
you
here's
a
jelly
one
you
want
it
yeah
i
did
a
little
research
too
dracula
likes
to
live
in
style
which
means
we
can
rule
out
the
usual
dumps
vampires
haunt
you
shouldn't
go
by
yourself
buffy
i
mean
this
guy's
seriously
dangerous
hey
take
off
that
scarf
you're
under
the
thrall
of
the
dark
prince
then
take
off
the
scarf
and
what
did
i
tell
you
that's
thrall
no
that's
okay
i
shouldn't
take
this
personally
i
mean
what
with
angel
i
mean
it's
understandable
that
there
would
be
transference
i
mean
they're
both
broody
immortals
okay
but
you
are
not
going
anywhere
near
him
again
another
bust
too
late
to
worry
about
that
now
if
we
hurry
we
can
hit
these
last
places
i've
lived
in
sunnydale
a
couple
of
years
now
know
what
i've
never
noticed
before
a
big
honking
castle
your
master
okeydokey
buffy
are
you
in
giles
giles
come
on
come
on
grab
my
hand
come
on
no
no
no
sir
no
more
chick
pit
for
you
come
on
buffy
you
okay
it
coulda
been
worse
at
least
you
weren't
making
time
with
the
dracubabes
like
giles
here
