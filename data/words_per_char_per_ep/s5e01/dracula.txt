i
am
you
know
who
i
am
as
i
would
now
without
question
that
you
are
buffy
summers
naturally
you're
known
throughout
the
world
why
else
would
i
come
here
for
the
sun
i
came
to
meet
the
renowned

killer
naked
perhaps
but
your
power
is
rooted
in
darkness
you
must
feel
it
i
have
no
interest
in
you
leave
us
this
is
not
the
time
i
will
see
you
soon
silence
you
will
be
my
emissary
my
eyes
and
ears
in
daylight
serve
me
well
you
will
be
rewarded
i
will
make
you
an
immortal
a
child
of
darkness
that
feeds
on
life
itself
on
blood
you
are
strange
and
offputting
go
now
you
are
magnificent
no
you
are
different
kindred
pull
your
hair
back
i
have
searched
the
world
over
for
you
i
have
yearned
for
you
for
a
creature
whose
darkness
rivals
my
own
you
have
been
tasted
unworthy
he
let
you
go
but
the
embrace

his
bite

you
remember
do
not
fight
i
can
feel
your
hunger
leave
us
we
must
not
be
interrupted
i
knew
you'd
come
put
the
stake
down
are
you
afraid
i
will
bite
you
slayer
that's
why
you
came
stop
me
stake
me
do
you
know
why
you
cannot
resist
because
you
do
not
want
to
they're
here
they
will
not
find
us
we
are
alone
always
alone
there
is
so
much
i
have
to
teach
you
your
history
your
power

what
your
body
is
capable
of
you
long
to
and
you
will
have
eternity
to
discover
yourself
but
first

a
little
taste
i
didn't
mean
for
me
all
those
years
fighting
us
your
power
so
near
to
our
own
and
you've
never
once
wanted
to
know
what
it
is
that
we
fight
for
never
even
a
taste
i
have
not
drunk
enough
for
you
to
change
you
must
be
near
death
to
become
one
of
us
and
that
comes
only
when
you
plead
for
it
no
your
craving
goes
deeper
than
that
you
think
you
know

what
you
are

what's
to
come
you
haven't
even
begun
find
it
the
darkness
find
your
true
nature
you
are
resisting
come
here
come
to
me
what
is
this
