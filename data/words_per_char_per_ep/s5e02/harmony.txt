know
i'm
being
you
know
sarcastic
or
whatever
anyway
i'm
feeling
really
good
about
this
new
plan
people
i
think
it's
a
winner
we
don't
not
yet
because
that's
not
the
plan
do
i
have
to
go
over
the
plan
again
we
use
the
sister
as
bait
we
send
buffy
a
note
we
send
buffy
a
note
telling
her
that
if
she
wants
to
see
her
sister
again
she
has
to
come
alone
to
a
place
we
choose
she
comes
we
jump
her
we
kill
her
i
guess
we're
not
eating
the
girl
cause
that's
not
the
plan
they
don't
respect
me
they
pretend
they
do
but
deep
down
they
think
i'm
nothing
i
mean
i'm
the
one
who
put
this
group
together
me
but
they
treat
me
like
i
don't
even
matter
do
you
have
any
idea
what
that
feels
like
they
have
no
idea
how
much
pressure
i'm
under
i
have
to
make
all
the
hard
decisions
and
it's
hard
excuse
me
i
didn't
hear
anybody
