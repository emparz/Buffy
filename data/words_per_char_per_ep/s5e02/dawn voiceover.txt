nobody
knows
who
i
am
not
the
real
me
it's
like
nobody
cares
enough
to
find
out
i
mean
does
anyone
ever
ask
me
what
i
want
to
do
with
my
life
or
what
my
opinion
is
on
stuff
or
what
restaurant
to
order
in
from
no
underline
exclamation
point
exclamation
point
exclamation
point
no
one
understands
no
one
has
an
older
sister
who's
a
slayer
people
wouldn't
be
so
crazy
about
her
if
they
had
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
her
every
single
day
everybody
cares
what
she
thinks
just
'cause
she
can
do
backflips
and
stuff
like
that's
such
a
crucial
job
skill
in
the
real
world
plus
mom
lets
her
get
away
with
everything
your
sister's
saving
the
world
i
could
so
save
the
world
if
somebody
handed
me
super
powers
but
i'd
think
of
a
cool
name
and
wear
a
mask
to
protect
my
loved
ones
which
buffy
doesn't
even
if
this
town
wasn't
so
lame
everyone
would
completely
know
what
she
does
and
then
i
bet
they
wouldn't
even
be
that
impressed
because
like
killing
things
with
wood
oh
scary
vampires
they
die
from
a
splinter
riley
my
sister's
boyfriend
is
so
into
her
they're
always
kissing

and
groping
i
bet
they
have
sex
i
don't
think
buffy's
watcher
likes
me
too
much
i
think
it's
'cause
he's
just
so

old
i'm
not
sure
how
old
he
is
but
i
heard
him
use
the
word
newfangled
one
time
so
he's
gotta
be
pretty
far
gone
willow's
the
awesomest
person
she's
the
only
one
i
know
who
likes
school
as
much
as
me
even
her
friends
are
cool
like
tara
she
and
willow
are
both
witches
they
do
spells
and
stuff
which
is
so
much
cooler
than
slaying
i
told
mom
one
time
i
wished
they'd
teach
me
some
of
the
things
they
do
together
aand
then
she
got
really
quiet
and
made
me
go
upstairs
huh
i
guess
her
generation
isn't
cool
with
witchcraft
xander
is
so
much
cuter
than
anyone
and
smarter
too
he
totally
skipped
college
and
got
a
job
working
construction
which
is
so
kind
of

deep
you
know
he
builds
things
and
he's
brave
too
just
last
week
he
went
undercover
to
stop
that
dracula
guy
xander
treats
everyone
like
an
equal
he
doesn't
look
down
on
people
even
when
he
should
he
says
i'm
like
a
kid
sister
but
sometimes
when
he
looks
at
me
i
feel
like
he
sees
me
as
i
am
as
a
woman
buffy
probably
would've
gotten
in
way
more
trouble
than
me
anyway
but
i
guess
it
was
pretty
okay
of
her
not
to
say
anything
to
mom
anya's
gonna
be
okay
and
xander
wasn't
mad
at
me
so
stuff
mostly
worked
out
not
that
buffy's
really
changed
at
all
like
she
ever
would
