find
it

breathe
into
it
well
i
sympathize
with
you
buffy
i
truly
do
but
i'm
certain
that
riley
understands
better
than
anyone
else
the
importance
of
training
you
can't
allow
personal
concerns
to
distract
you
from
dawn
will
you
stop
fiddling
with
the
radio
and
sit
down
you're
entering
a
new
realm
here
buffy
one
for
which
i
myself
am
not
entirely
prepared
are
you
ready
for
this
commitment
blast
i'm
just
not
used
to
this
automatic
transmission
ii
loathe
this
sitting
here
not
contributing
no
iit's
not
working
out
well
it
did
seduce
me
all
red
and
sporty
iii
don't
know
i
just

i
was
so
at
loose
ends
ii
found
myself
searching
for

some
way
of
feeling
more
perhaps
as
i
am
to
act
as
your
watcher
again
a
modicum
of
respect
might
be
in
order
i'm
serious
buffy
there's
going
to
be
far
less
time
for
the
sort
of
flighty
frivolous
dawn
hey
there's
willow
and
tara
ooh
they
haven't
seen
my
new
car
handles
like
a
dream
i
can
hear
you
willow
that's
odd
i
make
it
four
at
least
come
on
buffy
this
could
be
very
serious
whoever's
leading
this
pack
of
vampires
appears
to
be
interested
in
learning
more
about
you
perhaps
searching
for
weaknesses
or

good
lord
well
i
had
no
idea
the
profit
margins
on
a
shop
like
this
were
so
high
look
at
this
uh
low
overhead
outofstate
orders
international

it's
no
wonder
there's
never
any
trouble
attracting
new
owners
a
place
like
this
is
a
virtual
buffy
deathtrap
what
well
uh
yes
there
is
that
but
uh
still
location
pedestrian
traffic
buffy
you
should
begin
looking
for
their
lair
straight
away
impressive
square
footage
i
bet
the
death
rate
keeps
the
rent
down
oh
hello
something's
been
taken
from
this
case
look
here
i
should
think
an
item
of
of
value
oror
power
possibly
even
a
willow
a
unicorn
10inch
ceramic
unicorn
imported
from
thailand
which
begs
the
question
what
kind
of
an
unholy
creature
fancies
cheap
tasteless
statuary
why
wouldn't
i
be
i
was
a
librarian
for
years
this
is
exactly
the
same
except
people
pay
for
the
things
they
don't
return
it'll
give
me
focus
increase
my
resources
and
it'll
prevent
you
lot
from
trampling
all
over
my
flat
at
all
hours
there
may
even
be
some
space
for
you
to
train
in
the
back
i
watched
passions
with
spike
let
us
never
speak
of
it
