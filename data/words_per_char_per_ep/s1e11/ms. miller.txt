'if
you
prick
us
do
we
not
bleed
if
you
tickle
us
do
we
not
laugh
if
you
poison
us
do
we
not
die
and
if
you
wrong
us
shall
we
not
revenge'
okay
so
talk
to
me
people
how
does
what
shylock
says
here
about
being
a
jew
relate
to
our
discussion
about
the
anger
of
the
outcast
in
society
care
to
elaborate
but
has
shylock
suffered
what's
his
place
in
venice
society
well
cordelia's
raised
an
interesting
point
here
which
we'll
pursue
at
a
later
time
good
observations
today
cordelia
it's
always
exciting
to
know
someone's
actually
done
the
reading
well
i
have
your
outline
here
but
why
don't
you
stop
by
tomorrow
after
school
we'll
go
over
it
then
you're
welcome
i'll
see
you
then
cordelia
could
you
possibly
be
on
time
who's
there
attacked
didn't
see
so
who
knows
the
answer
to
this
one
think
about
it
cordelia
exactly
so
what
do
we
call
him
willow
xander
absolutely
who
doesn't
agree
with
that
okay
and
how
about
you
