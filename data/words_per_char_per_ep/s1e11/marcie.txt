see
his
toupee
i
mean
it

'cause

i
remember
you
all
your
idiot
slut

i
hate
them
they
take
your
life
and
they
suck
it
out
of
you
but
then
they
didn't
see
me
coming
they
gotta
learn
they
gotta
learn
uh
i'm
disappointed
i'd
really
hoped
you
guys
had
figured
it
out
by
now
you
don't
get
it
you're
not
the
student
you're
the
lesson
your
face
that's
what
this
is
all
about
isn't
it
your
beautiful
face
that's
what
makes
you
shine
just
a
little
bit
brighter
than
the
rest
of
us
we
all
want
what
you
have
to
be
noticed
remembered
to
be
seen
well
i'm
fulfilling
your
fondest
wish
i'm
gonna
give
you
a
face
no
one
will
ever
forget
what
are
you
gonna
do
slay
me
you
shoulda
stayed
outta
my
way
y'know
i
i
thought
i
thought
you
would
understand
my
vision
but
you're
just
like
them
you
should
be
grateful
i
mean
people
who
pass
you
in
the
street
are
gonna
remember
you
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
children
are
gonna
dream
about
you
and
every
one
of
your
your
friends
who
comes
to
the
coronation
tonight
will
take
the
sight
of
the
may
queen
to
their
graves
no
we
really
have
to
get
started
the
local
anesthetic's
gonna
wear
off
soon
and
i
don't
want
you
to
faint
it's
less
fun
if
you're
not
awake
let
me
see
i
think
we
should
start
with
your
smile
i
think
it
should
be
wider
yeah
i'll
bet
you
know
how
i
feel
i'm
sure
you
can
just
be
with
all
your
friends
and
feel
so
alone
'cause
they
don't
really
know
you
you're
just
a
typical
selfinvolved
spoiled
little
brat
and
you
think
you
can
charm
your
way
out
of
this
don't
you
isn't
that
what
you
think
i
see
right
through
you
hey
moron
i'm
invisible
how
are
you
gonna
fight
someone
you
can't
see
oh
my
god
where
are
we
going
hey
cool
