don't
worry
i'm
not
here
to
eat
not
for
a
long
while
i
can't
it's
uh
it's
too
hard
for
me
to
be
around
her
i
know
you've
been
researching
the
master
something's
already
in
motion
something
big
but
i
don't
know
what
you've
read
all
the
slayer
lore
there
is
right
the
codex
not
lost
misplaced
i
can
get
it
legends
of
vishnu
that's
not
really
my
area
of
expertise
oh
i
don't
know
looking
in
the
mirror
every
day
and
seeing
nothing
there
it's
an
overrated
pleasure
come
on
you
tell
me
i
brought
you
the
codex
i
came
in
through
the
basement
i
smelled
the
gas
i'll
get
it
it's
not
like
i
need
the
oxygen
