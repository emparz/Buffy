oh

fertility
statue

need
to
see
it
uhhuh
sounds
like
her
mom
doesn't
have
a
lot
to
do
look
what
i
found
it's
my
yearbook
from
junior
year
oh
look
there
i
am
this
is
gidgit
hair
don't
they
teach
you
anything
in
history
well
i
was
thinking
i
know
the
cheerleading
thing
didn't
work
out
maybe
you
should
think
about
joining
the
yearbook
staff
i
did
it
was
a
lot
of
fun
i
was
uh
photo
editor
i
got
to
be
on
every
page
made
me
look
much
more
popular
than
i
was
some
of
the
best
times
i
had
in
school
were
working
on
the
yearbook
your
own
thing
whatever
it
is
got
you
kicked
out
of
school
and
we
had
to
move
here
to
find
a
decent
school
that
would
take
you
honey
uhhh
uhhh
great
parenting
form
little
shaky
on
the
dismount
you're
in
a
good
mood
listen
honey
about
yesterday
i
really
still
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
despite
the
problems
you've
had
i
really
a
what
buffy
are
you
feeling
well
i
don't
get
it
i've
been
doing
a
lot
of
thinking
about
where
you're
coming
from
how
to
relate
to
you
and
i've
come
to
a
very
simple
conclusion
i
don't
get
it
you're
sixteen
i
think
there's
a
a
biological
imperative
whereby
i
can't
understand
you
because
i'm
not
sixteen
oh
that's
a
frightful
notion
go
through
all
that
again
not
even
if
it
helped
me
understand
you
i
don't
get
it
