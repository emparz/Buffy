people
scoff
at
things
like
school
spirit
but
look
at
these
girls
giving
their
all
like
this
ooo
stretchy
where
was
i
who
said
i
was
pretending
oh
hey
here's
a
good
luck
thing
for
tryouts
so
we
have
no
idea
what
caused
this
that's
a
comfort
so
maybe
amber's
got
this
power
to
make
herself
be
on
fire
it's
like
the
human
torch
only
it
hurts
i'll
ask
around
about
her
what
d'ya
mean
we're
a
team
aren't
we
a
team
oh
huh
i
laugh
in
the
face
of
danger
then
i
hide
until
it
goes
away
cool
was
she
wearin'
it
the
bracelet
she
was
wearin'
it
right
pretty
much
like
we're
goin'
out
so
i'm
just
a
figure
of
fun
i
should
ask
her
out
right
that's
why
you're
so
cool
you're
like
a
guy
you're
my
guy
friend
that
knows
about
girl
stuff
oh
hey
they're
posting
the
list
cover
me
i'm
goin'
in
one
of
those
girls
hit
me
really
hard
you
should
test
for
steroids
okay
not
only
did
you
make
the
team
but
you
miss
summers
are
the
first
alternate
and
amy's
number
three
and
what
a
better
way
to
celebrate
than
with
a
romantic
drive
through
for
i
am
xander
king
of
cretins
may
all
lesser
cretins
bow
before
me
cordelia
you
haven't
been
mean
to
me
all
day
is
it
something
i've
done
okay
see
how
she
has
no
clue
that
i'm
even
a
mammal
much
less
a
human
being
this
is
the
invisible
man
syndrome
a
blessing
in
cordelia's
case
a
curse
in
buffy's
it's
worse
i'm
just
like
a
part
of
the
scenery
like
an
old
shoe
or
a
rug
that
you
walk
on
every
day
but
don't
even
really
see
it
will
yeah
that
is
the
point
you
don't
have
to
drive
it
through
my
head
like
a
railroad
spike
i'm
gonna
take
your
advice
and
not
beat
around
the
bush
nah
i
gotta
be
a
man
and
ask
her
out
y'know
i
gotta
stop
giving
her
id
bracelets
uh
subtle
innuendos
taking
polaroids
outside
of
her
bedroom
window
late
at
night
that
last
part
is
a
joke
to
relieve
the
tension
because
here
she
comes
okay
into
battle
i
go
would
you
ask
her
out
for
me
no
man
me
battle
buffy
would
you
like
to
uh
huh
oh
i
don't
know
what
i'm
saying
is
accompany
me
friday
night
first
vampires
now
witches
no
wonder
you
can
still
afford
a
house
in
sunnydale
yeah
those
guys
don't
hang
so
you
guys
are
leaning
towards
amy
look
we
still
have
to
stop
amy
we
should
grab
her
and
uh
no
no
that
would
be
the
last
thing
you
would
do
you
don't
wanna
leave
a
paper
trail
forget
that
we
don't
have
a
minute
cheerleaders
are
in
danger
buffy's
in
danger
you
were
the
first
alternate
you
are
on
the
team
now
that
cordelia's
out
you
could
be
next
we
gotta
get
you
to
a
safe
house
yeah
alright
alright
it's
not
what
you
think
oh
well
uh
ii
guess
it
is
what
you
think
i
can't
how's
buffy
doing
with
the
hair
wave
'hi'
to
the
nice
little
witch
we're
right
behind
you
only
further
back
did
you
see
amy
was
as
freaked
out
as
the
rest
of
us
is
it
me
or
is
buffy
a
bit
looped
yeah
before
she
hurts
someone
ay
she's
on
medication
a
wise
choice
indeed
i
don't
think
it
was
your
fault
let
her
speak
well
that's
great
a
vengeance
spell
like
she's
trying
to
get
even
with
buffy
well
how
do
we
reverse
the
spell
show
of
hands
look
i
don't
care
why
i
just
care
that
you
go
on
breathing
i
got
her
i
got
her
cut
her
head
off
saving
you
but
she's
evil
oh
uh
hey
willow
it's
cool
yeah
i
took
care
of
it
