wasting
my
youth
so
she
took
it
i

anything
about
her
powers
i

when
dad
was
here
they
would
fight
and
yell
and
he
would
call
her
a
witch
and
i
mean
i
would
just
thought

left
i
wanted
to
go
with
him
but
she
wouldn't
even
let
me
call
she
went
crazy

mean
she'd
lock
herself
upstairs
for
days
and
she
was
always
coming
down
on
me
telling
me
i
didn't
deserve
to
have
it
so
easy
and
that
i
didn't
know
how
hard
it
was
to
be
her
and
i
guess
she
showed
me
huh
a
few
months
ago
i
woke
up
in
h
her
bed
i
didn't
know
where
i
was
and
then
i
looked
in
the
mirror

she
finds
out

been
here
she'll
kill
me

are
you
going

little
brat
how
dare
you
raise
your
hand
to
your
mother
i
gave
you
birth
i
gave
up
my
life
so
you
could
drag
that
worthless
carcass
around
and
call
it
living
you've
never
been
anything
but
trouble
i'm
going
to
put
you
where
you
can't
make
trouble
again
that
body
was
mine

i
shall
look
upon
my
enemy

shall
look
upon
her
and
the
dark
place
will
have
her
soul
corsheth

her
