you
don't
like
the
color
no
i
believe
that's
your
trick
i
told
you
i'm
trying
out
for
the
cheerleading
squad
and
you'll
be
stopping
me
how
i
will
still
have
time
to
fight
the
forces
of
evil
okay
i
just
wanna
have
a
life
i
wanna
do
something
normal
something
safe
he
totally
lost
his
water
we
haven't
seen
a
vampire
in
over
a
week
i'd
say
he
should
get
a
girlfriend
if
he
wasn't
so
old
what's
this
oh
how
sweet
'yours
always'
xander
iiit
came
that
way
really
they
all
said
that
hi
they
have
cheerleading
coaches
hmm
that
much
quality
time
with
my
mom
would
probably
lead
to
some
quality
matricide
what
the
it's
okay
it's
okay
you're
gonna
be
okay
god
i've
been
slaying
vampires
for
more
than
a
year
now
and
i
have
seen
some
pretty
cringe
worthy
things
but
nobody's
hands
ever
got
toasted
before
so
this
isn't
a
vampire
problem
but
it
is
funky
right
not
of
the
norm
any
common
denominators
in
cases
of
spontaneous
combustion
i
need
to
get
the
skinny
on
amber
find
out
if
she's
had
any
colorful
episodes
before
you
guys
don't
have
to
get
involved
i
just
don't
like
putting
you
guys
in
danger
okay
just
walk
softly
at
least
until
we
know
a
little
more
i
mean
what
if
amber
isn't
causing
these
problems
herself
hey
mm
a
reverent
joy
what's
all
this
cool
we
had
tryouts
today
i
didn't
actually
get
to
try
out
there
was
an
accident
pretty
fierce
competition
though
mom
what
was
i
trying
out
for
that's
okay
your
platitudes
are
good
for
all
occasions
it
was
cheerleading
i'm
not
in
trouble
what
y'know
there's
this
girl
amy
and
um
she
trains
with
her
mom
like
three
hours
a
day
sounds
like
her
mom's
pretty
into
it
jeepers
don't
worry
you'll
do
great
no
catherine
madison
get
down
with
your
bad
self
that's
kinda
romantic
okay
that
part's
less
romantic
my
folks
split
up
too
uh
she
sounds
really
great
amy
but
um
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
need
to
lock
step
as
far
as
this
cheerleading
thing
no
amy
you
did
fine
wait
no
no
she's
she's
wiggin'
about
her
mom
big
cheer
queen
back
when
nazi
like
so
mommy
dearest
is
really
mommy
dearest
hey
any
word
on
amber
hmm
so
we
just
have
to
wait
and
we'll
see
what
happens
maybe
nothing
will
excuse
me
at
least
it's
over
and
you
know
what
i
think
we
should
do
about
it
brownie
pigout
my
house
after

underestimating
the
amount
of
pressure
a

carbon
copy

tend
to
wig
