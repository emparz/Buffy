she's
right
here
table
four
i
put
her
with
your
family
well
where
do
i
put
d'hoffryn
we
have
to
he's
my
exboss
you're
inviting
your
work
buddies
well
that
remains
to
be
seen
like
you
you
cut
your
hair
really
how
short
ahh
that
sounds
so
adorable
i
was
thinking
about
getting
my
hair
cut
before
the
wed
why
would
anyone
make
her
invisible
anyway
i
mean
invisible
slayer's
gotta
be
way
more
effective
than
the
standard
variety
well
it
would
help
if
we
had
a
little
bit
more
to
go
on
or

anything
to
go
on
well
seems
pretty
obvious
it's
some
kind
of
spell
that's
done
this
to
her
maybe
it's
a
mistake
oh
i
got
it
yeah
we'll
put
d'hoffryn
at
your
parents'
table
and
move
your
uncle
rory
to
table
five
near
the
bar
well
obviously
i
haven't
found
anything
yet
at
least
nothing
that
would
explain
why
things
near
buffy
become
invisible
ew
xander
an
unpleasant
tactile
experience
like
putting
my
hand
in
pudding
like
pudding
am
i
right
rice
or
tapioca
lumpy
like
that
i
don't
think
buffy's
gonna
be
too
broken
up
over
a
pylon
she's
pudding
tell
her
tell
her
about
the
pudding
