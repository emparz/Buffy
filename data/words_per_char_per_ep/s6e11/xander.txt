whatever's
happening
to
the
pylon
will
probably

don't
figure
out
how
this
was
done
spike

a
little
trouble
upstairs
minidisaster
area

she's
come
down
with
a
slight
case
of
invisibility
we
don't
know
yet
anyway
she's
not
at
the
house
and
i
really
really
need
to
find
her
after
your

exercises
you
know
kidding

a
new
problem
here

isn't
reversed
you're
gonna

well
dissolve
or

fade

into
nothing
