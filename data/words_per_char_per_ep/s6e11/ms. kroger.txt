oh
good
morning
you
must
be
dawn
i'm
doris
kroger
from
social
services
we
had
an
appointment
this
is
wednesday
little
bit
on
the
tardy
side
isn't
she
um
miss
summers
if
you
and
your
boyfriend
would
like
to
buffy
he
is
not
spike
looks
over
with
a
scowl
i'm
sorry
did
you
say
buffy
crib
he
said
crib
you
know
kids
today
and
their
buggin'
street
slang
he
sleeps
here
oh
so
you
live
with
another
woman
i
think
i've
seen
enough
it's
been
a
bad
time
now
for
a
while
hasn't
it
ms
summers
your
sister's
grades
have
fallen
sharply
in
the
last
year
due
in
large
part
to
her
frequent
absences
and
lateness
oh
i'm
sure
there
are
but
my
interest
is
in
dawn's
welfare
and
the
stability
of
her
home
life
something
i'm
just
not
convinced
that
an
unemployed
young
woman
like
yourself
can
provide
well
we'll
just
have
to
see
about
that
then
won't
we
oh
and
i'm
uh
going
to
recommend
immediate
probation
in
my
report
it
means
that
i'll
be
monitoring
you
very
closely
ms
summers
and
if
i
don't
see
that
things
are
improving
well
i'll
be
forced
to
recommend
that
you
be
stripped
of
your
sister's
guardianship
i
do
what
is
in
dawn's
best
interest

as
should
you
have
a
nice
day
what

where's
my
losing
my
mind
okay

the
she
turns
and
finds
the
mug
sitting
on
top
of
her
computer
monitor
as
she
reaches
for
it
it
floats
up
into
the
air
and
dances
around
a
little
what

mug

mug

gone
again

a
complete
boss

play
make
doris
a
dull
girl'
what
i
