oh
good
morning
you
must
be
dawn
i'm
doris
kroger
from
social
services
we
had
an
appointment
this
is
wednesday
little
bit
on
the
tardy
side
isn't
she
um
miss
summers
if
you
and
your
boyfriend
would
like
to
i'm
sorry
did
you
say
he
sleeps
here
oh
so
you
live
with
another
woman
i
think
i've
seen
enough
it's
been
a
bad
time
now
for
a
while
hasn't
it
ms
summers
your
sister's
grades
have
fallen
sharply
in
the
last
year
due
in
large
part
to
her
frequent
absences
and
lateness
oh
i'm
sure
there
are
but
my
interest
is
in
dawn's
welfare
and
the
stability
of
her
home
life
something
i'm
just
not
convinced
that
an
unemployed
young
woman
like
yourself
can
provide
well
we'll
just
have
to
see
about
that
then
won't
we
oh
and
i'm
uh
going
to
recommend
immediate
probation
in
my
report
it
means
that
i'll
be
monitoring
you
very
closely
ms
summers
and
if
i
don't
see
that
things
are
improving
well
i'll
be
forced
to
recommend
that
you
be
stripped
of
your
sister's
guardianship
i
do
what
is
in
dawn's
best
interest

as
should
you
have
a
nice
day
what

where's
my
losing
my
mind
okay
who's
the
what
not
you
the
mug
it's
but
i

i
heard
something
shut
up
shut
up
just
shut
up
what
oh
oh
yes
the
um
summers
file
it's
uh
it's
right
over
here
uh
it's
a
fifteenyearold
girl
living
under
her
older
sister's
guardianship
the
house
is
a
complete
what
i

i
i
i
i
didn't
do
this
i

it
was
the
voice
there
was
a
voice
before
it
made
my
coffee
dance
it
told
me
to
nothing
but
what
about
my
cases
i'm
not
crazy
i
am
not
crazy
