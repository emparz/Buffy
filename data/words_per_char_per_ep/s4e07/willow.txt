temporarily
to
work
out
a
few
things
i
know
that
sounds
lame
in
its
vagueness
but
i
assure
you
oz
will
be
back
oh
but
walsh
it
is
to
you
but
since
i'm
neither
a
freshman
nor
a
narcissist
i
have
to
consider
the
whole
class
if
your
friend
can't
respect
my
schedule
i
think
it's
best
he
not
come
back
come
in
oh
riley
hi
what's
up
she's
not
here
whatwhat
do
you
want
me
to
do
ok
say
that
i
help
and
you
start
a
conversation
it
goes
great
you
like
buffy
she
likes
you
you
spend
time
together
feelings
grow
deeper
and
one
day
without
even
realizing
it
you
find
you're
in
love
time
stops
and
it
feels
like
the
whole
world's
made
for
you
two
and
you
two
alone
until
the
day
one
of
you
leaves
and
rips
the
stillbeating
heart
from
the
other
who's
now
a
broken
hollow
mockery
of
the
human
condition
i
figured
it
was
why
should
i
trust
you
i've
seen
host
faces
before
they
usually
come
attached
to
liars
she
likes
cheese
she
has
a
stuffed
piggy
named
mr
gordo
loves
ice
capades
without
the
irony
and
she's
dragging
me
to
this
party
tonight
at
lowell
house
well
it'll
give
you
a
chance
to
interact
but
don't
get
fresh
sorry
i'm
not
your
accomplice
i'm
not
we're
clear
uhhuh
nono
we're
here
for
fun
i'm
gonna
grab
a
soda
i'lli'll
find
you
guys
ok
she's
wearing
the
halter
top
with
sensible
shoes
that
means
mostly
dancing
light
contact
but
don't
push
your
luck
heavy
conversation's
out
of
the
question
ask
her
to
dance
what's
the
matter
then
talk
keep
eye
contact
funny
is
good
but
don't
be
glib
and
remember
if
you
hurt
her
i
will
beat
you
to
death
with
a
shovel
a
vague
disclaimer
is
nobody's
friend
have
fun
you
really
really
did
well
you
failed
extremely
well
you
need
to
relax
i
mean
you're
not
proposing
you're
just
making
contact
getting
a
reaction
any
reaction
is
ok
except
projectile
vomiting
but
what
are
the
chances
of
that
a
dingoes
ate
my
babies
song
comes
on
willow
gets
a
horrificly
depressed
look
this
song
big
thank
you
now

i
i
want
you
to
find
buffy
and
tell
her
that
i
went
home
and
not
to
worry
about
me
which
at
least
will
give
you
something
to
say
you'll
do
fine
come
in
spike
whwhat
do
you
want
uh
a
spell
i
can

that
ii'll
scream
no
maybe
you
were
nervous
maybe
you're
trying
too
hard
doesn't
this
happen
to
every
vampire
it's
me
isn't
it
well
you
came
looking
for
buffy
then
settled
ii
you
didn't
want
to
bite
me
i
just
happened
to
be
around
i
know
i'm
not
the
kind
of
girl
vamps
like
to
sink
their
teeth
into
it's
always
like
'ooh
you're
like
a
sister
to
me'
or
'oh
you're
such
a
good
friend'
spike
don't
be
ridiculous
i'd
bite
you
in
a
heartbeat
really
when
i
never
would
have
guessed
you
played
the
bloodlust
kinda
cool
but
if
you
could
you
know
this
doesn't
make
you
any
less
terrifying
you're
being
too
hard
on
yourself
why
don't
we
wait
a
half
an
hour
and
try
again
or
