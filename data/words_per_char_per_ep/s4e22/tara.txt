i
think
it's
strange
i
mean
i
think
i
should
worry
that
we
haven't
found
her
name
you'd
think
she'd
let
us
know
her
name
by
now
you're
not
worried
you
don't
know
everything
about
me
oh
you
know
that
they
will
find
out
you
know
about
you
are
you
gonna
finish
in
time
for
class
but
you've
never
taken
drama
before
might
miss
something
important
why
not
things
aren't
going
very
well
you
don't
understand
yet
do
you
yes
the
play's
already
started
that's
not
the
point
everyone's
starting
to
wonder
about
you
the
real
you
if
they
find
out
they'll
punish
you
i

i
can't
help
you
with
that
shh
we
just
think
you're
really
interesting
do
you
wanna
come
in
the
back
with
us
for
who
you
lost
them
oh

that
clock's
completely
wrong
here
you
think
you
know

what's
to
come

what
you
are
you
haven't
even
begun
someone
has
to
speak
for
her
the
first
the
slayer
does
not
walk
in
this
world
