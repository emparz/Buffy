in
return
for
your
silence
no
doubt
you
sure
you
won't
join
us
still
feel
a
little
bit
too
wired
all
right
everyone
pay
attention
in
just
a
few
moments
that
curtain
is
going
to
open
on
our
very
first
production
now
everyone
that
willow's
ever
met

is
out
in
that
audience
including
all
of
us
that
means
we
have
to
be
perfect
stay
in
character
remember
your
lines
and
energy
energy
energy
especially
in
the
musical
numbers
acting
is
not
about
behaving
it's
about
hiding
the
audience
wants
to
find
you
strip
you
naked
and
eat
you
alive
so
hide
stop
that
now
costumes
sets
um
the
things
that
you
uh
you
know
uh
you
um
shot
from
above
we
see
the
cast
gathered
harmony
still
jumping
up
behind
giles
trying
to
bite
him
you
hold
them
you
touch
them
uh
use
them
um
no
yes
it's
all
about
subterfuge
that's
very
annoying
now
go
on
out
there
lie
like
dogs
and
have
a
wonderful
time
now
if
we
can
stay
in
focus
keep
our
heads
and
if
willow
can
stop
stepping
on
everyone's
cues
i
know
this'll
be
the
best
production
of
death
of
a
salesman
we've
ever
done
stop
it
good
luck
everyone
break
a
leg
not
very
much
at
all
really
i
have
to
say
i
really
feel
that
apocalypse
now
is
overrated
oh
i'm
beginning
to
understand
this
now
it's
all
about
the
journey
isn't
it
spike's
like
a
son
to
me
very
good
go
on
put
your
back
into
it
a
watcher
scoffs
at
gravity
xander
what
are
you
doing
here
it's
because
of
what
we
did
i
know
that
hm
now
the
others
have
gone
on
ahead
now
listen
very
carefully
your
life
may
depend
on
what
i'm
about
to
tell
you
you
need
ce
n'est
pas
le
temps
pour
des
jeux
this
is
not
the
time
for
games
c'est
que
j'ai
vous
dire
that's
what
i
said
allonsy
la
let's
go
it's
more
serious
than
we
thought
this
is
the
way
women
and
men
have
behaved
since
the
beginning
before
time
now
look
into
the
light
well
it
appears
she's
never
heard
the
fable
about
patience
the
the
one
about
the
fox
and
the
uh
less
patient
fox
yes
go
ahead
buffy
you
have
a
sacred
birthright
to
protect
mankind
don't
stick
out
your
elbow
i
haven't
got
any
treats
this
is
my
business
blood
of
the
lamb
and
all
that
oh
now
you're
gonna
get
that
all
over
your
face
i
know
you
don't
push
me
around
you
know
i
have
a
great
deal
to
do
sideshow
freak
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
with
all
of
this
i
still
think
buffy
should
have
killed
you
honestly
you
meet
the
most
appalling
sorts
of
people
he
walks
on
in
the
background
we
see
spike
still
in
jesus
pose
more
flashbulbs
going
off
i'm
so
sorry
i'm
late
there's
a
great
deal
going
on
and
all
at
once
she's
doing
quite
well
we
have
to
think
of
the
facts
willow
i'm
very
busy
i
have
a
gig
myself
you
know
that
used
to
be
us
it's
strange
it's
not
like
anything
we've
faced
before
it
seems
familiar
somehow
of
course
the
spell
we
cast
with
buffy

must
have
released
some
primal
evil
that's
come
back
seeking
i'm
not
sure
what

willow
look
through
the
chronicles
for
some
reference

to
a
warrior
beast
i've
got
to
warn
buffy

there's
every
chance
she
might
be
next

xander
help
willow
and
try
not
to
bleed
on
my
couch
i've
just
had
it
steamcleaned
no
wait
well
that
was

obvious
i
know
who
you
are
and
i
can
defeat
you

with
my
intellect
i

can
cripple
you
with
my
thoughts
of
course
you
underestimate
me
you
couldn't
know
you
never
had
a
watcher
somehow
our
joining
with

buffy
and

invoking
the
essence
of
the
the
slayer's
power
was
an
affront
to
the
source
of
that
power
i
did
i
said
there
could
be
dire
consequences
you
all
right
you
seem
a
bit
uh
