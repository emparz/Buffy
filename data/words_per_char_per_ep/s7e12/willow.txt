my
chrysalises—chrysali
my
butterfly
transformer
pods

to
be
about
that
age
well
we'll
know
soon
enough
who
the
next
potential
is
somebody's
life
is
about
to
change
pretty
much
the
spell
will
conjure
up
this
brilliant
light
aand
the
light
will
find
the
potential
and
it'll
illuminate
her
with
a
glowing
aura
i've
enchanted
this
map
so
we
can
track
her
basic
location
we'll
have
to
hotfoot
it
but
i'm
betting
we
find
her
tonight
to
light
the
aura
of
the
new
skin
of
snake
and
chrysalis
too
the
smell
will
lead
us
to
the
potential
she'll
also
be
lit
with
a
brilliant
aura
i
don't
know
i
don't
think
so
i
suck
i'm
sorry
you

maybe
we
could
figure
something
out
on
the
computer
i
just—i
was
sure
that
it
was
gonna
work
dawn
i
think
it
worked
dawn
are
you
ok
i
did
it
right
a
slayer
makes
sense
i
guess
remember
that
thing
about
they
share
the
same
blood
or
whatever
i've
got
to
call
buffy
she's
gonna
be
so
excited

i
guess
buffy
trains
you
it's
ok
we'll
protect
you
well
we'll
tell
her
soon
as
she
gets
back
what
dawn
she
has
to
know
dawnie
of
course
she
will
it's
not
like
that
it's
like
she's
part
of
this
huge
power
i
know
what
that
feels
like
it
feels
wonderful
we
don't
know
that
come

a
locator
