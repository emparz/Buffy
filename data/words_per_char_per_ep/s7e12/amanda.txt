do
people
ever
think
you're
weird
i
feel
like
people
think
i'm
weird
and
so
they
pick
on
me
but
i
might
be—weird
one
of
the
boys
who
picks
on
me
i
kind
of—see
if
a
guy
picks
on
you
is
it
weird
to
think
he's
cute
it's
just
the
last
few
times
i've
seen
him
i've
wanted
to
you
know
pick
on
himextra
more
the
thing
is
i
can't
tell
my
mom
says
when
a
guy
teases
you
it
means
he
likes
you
is
it
weird
we're
mean
to
each
other
and
we
like
each
other
hey
dawn
whatcha
doing
um
yeah
just
walking
too
k
well
have
a
good
walk
i
guess
i'll
see
you
monday
morning
you
all
right
i
guess
i—
i
had
a
bit
of
a—
it's
been
a
bizarre
night
uh
nobodyexactly
i
don't
think
you'd
exactly
believe
me
ii
was
at
school
late
because
of
you
know
swing
choir
and
i
tore
my
sweater
you
know
the
striped
ones
we
wear
so
i
went
to
home
sciences
to
sew
it
up
and
by
the
time
i
was
finished
the
place
was
empty
so
it
was
all
echoy
and
lonely
and
then
there
was
this
guy—or
thing
and
it
was—it
scratched
me
and
i
kinda
dodged
it
and
it
kinda
hit
its
head
i
don't
know
it
was
messed
up
in
the
face
'round
here
abouts
is
it
real
was
it
really
a
vampire
i
bet
you
think
i'm
crazy
well
cool
the
thing
is
after
it
hit
its
head
i
kinda
freaked
out
i
trapped
it
in
a
room
and
it's
still
there
and
now
i
don't
know
what
to
do
well
i
was
thinking
of
getting
your
sister
well
i've
heard
people
talking
a
lot
of
'em
think
she's
some
kind
of
highfunctioning
schizophrenic
but
i
also
heard
that
maybe—like
maybe
she
could
help
with
this
kind
of
thing
do
you
think
we
should
go
get
her
come
on
the
vampire's
upstairs
are
you
spooked
out
so
if
he
scratched
me
with
a
tooth
am
i—i'm
not
gonna
turn
into
one
am
i
nope
right
he
can
do
that
so
i
was
thinking
we
don't
have
to
kill
the
vampire
do
we
just
suppose
he
got
out
and
was
maybe
like
encouraged
toward
the
gym
while
the
marching
band
was
playing
because
the
way
they
look
down
on
the
swing
choir
it
might
be
you
know
funny
i'm
just
saying
yeah
can
they
do
that
guess
you're
some
kind
of
monster
expert
too
it
was
it
was
here
where'd
it
go
what
are
you
doing
too
big
think
we're
safe
yes
i'm
listening
i
believe
you
better
than
mine
about
him
eating
the
marching
band
besides
your
plan'll
work
you're
getting
it
done
i
can't
what
were
those
no
i
can't
ok
one
minute
i'm
in
swing
choir
and
the
next—
what
the
hell's
going
on
you
tell
me
to
come
to
you
with
problems
turns
out
a
vampire
attacked
me
problem
so
i
go
to
your
house
and
when
i
get
there
this
orange
cloud
hits
me
and
i
don't
know
if
you're
into
the
drugs
but
that's
not
my
deal
all
right
that
cloud
hit
me
and
i
got
a
little
dizzy
and
discombobulated
i
don't
know
i
mean
when
i
saw
the
vampire
vamp—
cool
yeah
when
that
vampire
attacked
me
i
felt
this
kind
of
charge
you
know
