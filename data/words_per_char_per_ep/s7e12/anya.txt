all
these
girls
flocking
to
town
and
this
one's
already
here
and
under
our
noses
i'm
fairly
sure
that's
the
smell
of
a
hardboiled
egg
being
thrown
into
a
fire
so
you
messed
up
the
spell
again
at
least
it
smells
you
know
otherworldly
oh
look
pretty
wow
it's
like
one
second
you
were
this
klutzy
teenager
with
fake
memories
and
a
history
of
kleptomania
and
thenâ€”then
suddenly
you're
a
hero
a
hero
with
a
much
abbreviated
lifespan
yeah
i
never
got
that
well
it's
a
lot
like
being
the
pope
in
that
way
except
you
don't
have
to
be
some
old
catholic
well
you
could
start
by
maybe
sitting
still
for
a
sec
right
we
also
have
to
protect
you
from
the
uh
eyeless
guys
the
ones
with
the
sharp
sharp
knives
dawn's
gonna
be
a
slayer
that's
because
you're
a
part
of
something
larger
like
being
swallowed
by
something
larger
well
it
is
a
mixed
bag
you
know
if
she
gets
to
be
the
slayer
then
her
life
is
short
and
brutal
and
if
she
doesn't
then
it
smells
of
unfulfilled
potential
my
swallowed
analogy
looks
pretty
sweet
right
now
doesn't
it
this
isn't
about
womany
power
this
is
about
the
fact
that
dawn
just
might
have
bought
herself
an
early
death
short
brutal
life
sharp
sharp
knives
i
covered
this
he's
right
we
shouldn't
rush
her
rushing's
only
gonna
get
her
killed
want
me
to
kick
down
the
door
what
it'd
be
funny
besides
she's
been
sulking
in
there
forever
oh
crap
double
crap
