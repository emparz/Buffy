she
totally
fainted
right
in
the
middle
of
our
fetal
pig
dissection
somehow
i
just
don't
think
she's
cut
out
for
the
slayage
biz
how
long
will
it
take
will
we
find
out
who
it
is
right

it
supposed
to
be
shimmying
all
over
like
that
good
call
i'm
gonna
open
the
door
and
let
this
place
air
out
maybe
yyou
did
it
wrong
was
it
aambiguous
in
any
way
did
you
maybe
say
potential
sailors
'cause
ii
do
like
the
water
whoa
ii
can't
think
about
this
it
doesn't
fit
in
my
head
she
has
to
die
i
mean
if
i
was
ever
the
slayer
it
would
mean
she
died
well
sure
'cause
all
the
important
people
are
with
her
whwhawhat
happens
now
ii
cant
ii
need
to
know
what
happens
to
my
life
right
i
train
with
the
potentials—other
potentials
learn
to
do
the
stuff
they're
learning
bringers
what
if
they
saw
the
spell
we
did
a
big
orange
powerful
spell
what
if
they
sensed
it
what
if
they're
on
their
way
let's
not
ii
know
just
not
right
away
guys
when
mom
appeared
to
me
she
said—
no
please
she
said
something
about
buffy
and
i'm
thinking
i'm
just
not
so
sure
buffy
will
be
happy
for
me
will
she
i
mean
i'm
not
even
sure
i'm
happy
for
me
everything's
different
for
me
now
thisthis
is
too
much
for
my
head
again
i
can't
i—i
need
to
be—
i'm
chosen
hey
uh
just
walking
you
yeah
sure
just
walking
you
know
aare
you
all
right
you've
got
a
thing
what
happened
who
did
that
to
you
try
me
uhhuh
what
kind
of
thing
and
when
it
scratched
at
you
did
it—was
it
scratching
with
its
teeth
i—i
believe
you
it's
ok
this
is
totally
dealable
don't
worry
you
know
something
about
my
sister
she's
out
i'll
take
this
one
whew
i
think
i
strained
something
maybe
something
i'll
need
later
in
life
uh…
no
i'm
all
right
ii
can
do
this
it's
mostly
instinct
i
think
uh
only
if
he
slashed
open
one
of
his
own
veins
and
led
you
to
drink
deep
of
his
blood
good
you're
lucky
he
didn't
hurt
you
way
more
than
that
what
well
he
didn't
break
down
the
door
anyway
they're
very
strong
and
although
they
feel
pain
they
don't
hold
back
because
of
it
let's
just
say
it
runs
in
the
family
i
thought
you
said
it
was
locked

or
right
side
up
to
work
which
is
it
in
here
help
we
need
to
barricade
this
too
small
stay
down
amanda
listen
we're
gonna
get
out
of
this
both
of
us
alive
alive
you
believe
me
good
'cause
i
got
a
plan
ok
this
plan
of
mine
i'm
not
guaranteeing
it'll
work
in
case
you
haven't
noticed
i
don't
know
what
i'm
doing
here
help
amanda
help
me
amanda
no

to
me
remember
when
you
said
i
was
special

the
thing
is
you
are
this
is
your
battle
amanda
you
can
you've
got
to
look
i've
got
your
back
but
this
is
something
you
have
to
do
it's
something
you
were
born
to
do
here
this
belongs
to
you
she
was
at
the
doorway
it
was
willow's
spell
she's
the
potential
slayer
yeah
i
was
thinking
of
hitting
the
books
do
some
research
on
the
first
it's
in
retreat
mode
right
now
but
you're
still
gonna
need
to
know
how
to
fight
it
what's
up
they
can
handle
it
know
what
no
way
they've
got—
well
you
had
that
sexy
army
training
for
a
while
and—and
the
windows
really
did
need
fixing
yeah
i—
i
guess
i
kinda
lost
my
head
when
i
thought
i
was
the
slayer
the
power
wasn't
mine
maybe
that's
your
power
seeing
knowing
cape
is
good
