um
i
was
missing
something

afternoon

i
mean

tough
but
when
oz
walked
in
it
seemed
like
emotions
were
running
extra
high
hold
that
thought
man

was
record
time

for
yourself
base

is
agent

a
werewolf

say
i'm
surprised
i
didn't
think
willow
was
that
kind
of
girl
into
dangerous
guys
she
seems
smarter
than
that
whoa
hey
how
did
we
get
to
bigot
i'm
just
saying
it's
a
little
weird
to
date
someone
who
tries
to
eat
you
once
a
month
i'm
not
talking
about
you
morning
no
just
a
good
way
to
start
the
day

up
less
than
a
minute
and
somehow
i've
managed
to
piss
you
off
no
come
on
is
it
that
whole
thing
about
willow
last
night
look
i
only
said
what
i
said
because
i'm
concerned
i
don't
wanna
see
her
get
hurt
something
wrong
with
that
theorem
evil
name
one
bad
graham
does
it
matter
we'll
take
it
back
we'll
make
an
id
if
it
is
we'll
put
him
down
what's
the
holdup
i
thought
graham
gave
you
a
full
description
and
how
long
is
that
gonna
take
i
don't
need
a
bunch
of
tests
to
know
that
this
thing's
a
killer
hey
he's
coming
to
oz
why
he's
not
a
threat
now
oh
hey
that's
enough
come
on
the
guy's
a
student
i
know
him
oz
put
these
on
man
permission
to
speak
colonel
sir
the
prisoner
how'd
you
get
in
buffy
i
leave
now
i
can't
ever
come
back
i
just
wanted
to
hear
that
out
loud
no
sir
i'm
an
anarchist
it
was
better
besides
i
think
it's
mostly
me
the
initiative
wants
now
we'll
be
safe
for
tonight
at
least
the
campus
is
still
blacked
out

figure
out
my
next
move
tomorrow
i
don't
know
i'm
sorry
it
ended
that
way
but
i
am
glad
it's
done
i'm
glad
i
know
where
i
stand
finally
i
was
wrong
about
oz
i
was
being
a
bigot
still
i
was
in
a
totally
black
and
white
space
people
versus
monsters
and
it
ain't
like
that
especially
when
it
comes
to
love
