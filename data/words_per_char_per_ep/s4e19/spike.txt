means
you're
in
for
a
world
of
pain

you

sounds
like
a
lot
of
fun
i
get
that
i'm
still
not
sure
how
the
slayer
fits
in
yeah
the
thing
about
the
slayer
is
she
is
a
whiny
little
thing
but
when
it
comes
to
the
fighting
she
does
have
a
slight
tendency
to
win
this
all
goes
down
the
chip
comes
out
yeah
no
tricks

were
a
boy
scout
or
you
could
just
use
the
back
way

might
wanna
watch

news
travels
fast
with
us

all
like
a
good
laugh
i
happen
to
be
seeking
monetary
gratification
yeah
but
i
also
get
a
kick
out
of
jackin'
up
those
army
ginks
myself
i
know
how
to
find
the
big
guy
who
can
take
you

not
interested

i
was
stuck
in
that
hole

heard
things
from
other
guys
who've
gotten
out
i
can
get
you
in
no
alarms

cameras

waiting
look

i
wear

their
locks
