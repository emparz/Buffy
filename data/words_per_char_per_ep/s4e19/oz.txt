pretty
much
now

sorry
i'll
pass
thanks
look
i'm
going
to
devon's
to
see
if
he's
got
a
place
i
can
crash
but
i
was
hoping
that
we
could
talk
later
tonight
i'll
come
by
your
place
it's
great
to
see
you
guys
again
really
hey
actually
i
want
you
to
come
outside
i
wanna
show
you
something
it's
real
look
up
look
at
the
sky
i
guess
you
stopped
keeping
track
of
'em
after
i
left
full
moon
it's
a
long
story
i
talked
to
xander
and
he
said
you
didn't
have
a
new
guy
i
know
what
i
put
you
through
and
i'm
not
gonna
push
but
i
am
a
different
person
than
when
i
left
and
i
can
be
what
you
need
now
that's
what
i
want
that's
why
i'm
here
a
woman
in
tibet
traded
it
to
me
for
the
radiohead
record
got
a
lot
of
mileage
out
of
the
barter
system
well
it's
where
i
stayed
the
longest
this
warlock
in
romania
sent
me
to
the
monks
there
to
learn
some
meditation
techniques
very
intense
all
about
keeping
your
inner
cool
no
there's
more
i
take
some
herbs
and
stuff
some
chanting
a
couple
of
charms
doesn't
mean
you
haven't
gone
through
a
lot
well
thanks
for
that
yeah
we
talked
all
night
or
we
could
just
sleep
a
little
while
whatever
you
want
breakfast
it
is
are
you
looking
for
willow
she's
just
in
the
bathroom
down
the
hall
i
saw
you
at
giles'
yesterday
you
sure
you
don't
wanna
come
in
your
friend
came
by
the
blonde
girl
but
she
wouldn't
stay
so
what
do
you
think
where
you
wanna
go
hey
i
thought
i
smah
heard
willow
pretty
much
feeling

oddly
motivated
i
hope
so
is
that
her
sweater
you
smell
like
her
she's
all
over
you
do
you
know
that
but
there's
something
to
talk
about
are
you
two
involved
'cause
she
never
said
anything
to
me
like
that
we
talked
all
night
and
she
never
no
stop
is
she
in
love
with
you
tell
me
is
she
run
will
get
back
well
it
broke
down
outside
of
mexico
and
i
traded
my
bass
to
have
it
fixed
and
garaged
i
shouldn't
have
come
back
now
i
just
thought
i'd
changed
but
i
couldn't
look
at
you
i
mean
it
turns
out
the
one
thing
that
brings
it
out
in
me
is
you
which
falls
under
the
heading
of
ironic
in
my
book
well
so
we're
safe
then
'cause
you'll
never
do
that
again
but
you're
happy
it
may
be
safer
for
both
of
us
if
you
don't
it
was
stupid
to
think
that
you'd
just
be
waiting
i
know
but
now
is
not
that
time
i
guess
i
think
i
better
take
off
pretty
much
now
