spike
situation
still
normal
well
or
as
normal
as
this
school
ever
sees
well
no
fires
no
one's
head's
going
kablooey
and
the
swing
choir
and
the
marching
band
have
gone
back
to
their
normal
healthy
seething
resentment
no
it
can't
be
that
easy
hey
any
apocalypse
i
avert
without
dying
yeah
those
are
the
easy
ones
your
mother
got
to
tell
you
not
a
line
every
girl
likes
to
hear
but—in
this
case—
compliment
taken
maybe
you're
right
maybe
everything
is
fine
giles
what's
wrong
so
we
didn't
stop
it
then
giles
so
did
you
bring
back
any
potentials
spike
what
about
him
the
military
put
a
chip
in
spike's
head
so
he
couldn't
hurt
anyone
but
he
wouldn't
hurt
anyone
anymore
because
he
has
a
soul
now
no
the
trigger's
a
posthypnotic
thing
the
first
put
it
in
his
head
it
was—made
him—
he
was
killing
again
it
was
killing
him
giles
no
the
chip
the
trigger's
not
active
anymore
it
was
that
song
giles
i'm
telling
you
it
was
that
song
that
spike
was
singing
it
wasn't
like
it
had
a
catchy
hook
or
anything
like
i'm
coming
up
so
you
better
get
this
party
started
it
was
boring
old
and
english
just
like
you—ull
yule
brenner
a
british
yule
brenner
spike
spike
listen
to
me
are
you
all
right
don't
you
think
you
should
take
a
little
time
calm
down
she'll
be
ok
she's
tough
i'm
going
to
unchain
him
this
is
pointless
giles
he
doesn't
know
anything
your
prophylactic
stone
didn't
work
what's
wrong
could
use
a
little
of
that
ok
i
guess
now
is
as
good
a
time
as
we're
likely
to
see
for
a
while
just
hurry
back
i
have
don't
i
don't
know
giles
is
this
really
a
primo
time
for
a
training
session
in
case
you
haven't
noticed
our
plates
are
kinda
full
right
now
plus
i'm
not
really
sure
how
i
feel
about
leaving
spike
at
robin's
house
to
watch
over
him

away

found
her
dead
on
the
couch
i
understand
what
you
tried
to
do
but
she's
dead
i'm
preparing
to
fight
a
war
and
you're
looking
for
revenge
on
a
man
that
doesn't
exist
anymore
spike
is
the
strongest
warrior
we
have
we
are
gonna
need
him
if
we're
gonna
come
out
of
this
thing
alive
you
try
anything
again
he'll
kill
you
more
importantly
i'll
let
him
i
have
a
mission
to
win
this
war
to
save
the
world
i
don't
have
time
for
vendettas
the
mission
is
what
matters

taught
me
everything
i
need
