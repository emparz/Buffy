to
you
i
don't
give
a
piss
about
your
mum

was
a
slayer

was
a
vampire

the
way
the
game
is
played
she
knew
what
she
was
signing
up
for

the
rub

you
didn't
sign
up
for
it
and
you
weren't
hers

how
many
people
they've
got
around
them
they
fight
alone
life
of
the
chosen
one
the
rest
of
us
be
damned
your
mother
was
no
different
but
not
enough
to
quit
though
was
it
not
enough
to
walk
away
for
you
i'll
tell
you
a
story
about
a
mother
and
son
see
like
you
i
loved
my
mother
so
much
so
i
turned
her
into
a
vampire
so
we
could
be
together
forever
she
said
some
nasty
bits
to
me
after
i
did
that
been
weighing
on
me
for
quite
some
time
but
you
helped
me
figure
something
out
you
see
unlike
you
i
had
a
mother
who
loved
me
back
when
i
sired
her
i
set
loose
a
demon
and
it
tore
into
me
but
it
was
the
demon
talking
not
her
i
realize
that
now
my
mother
loved
me
with
all
her
heart
i
was
her
world
that's
a
nice
little
song
you
got
there
thanks
doc
you
cured
me
after
all
i
got
my
own
free
will
now
i'm
not
under
the
first's
or
anyone
else's
influences
now
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
before
i
kill
you
i
gave
him
a
pass
let
him
live
on
account
of
the
fact
i
killed
his
mother
but
that's
all
he
gets
he
even
so
much
as
looks
at
me
funny
again
i'll
kill
him
