fixated
on
a
couple
of
kisses
spike
look
i'm
sorry
okay
i'mi'm
sorry
if
you
thought
that
it
meant
more
but

when
i
kissed
you

you
know
i
was
thinking
about
giles
right
what
oh
gross
spike
he
left
i
was
depressed
ergo
vulnerability
and
and
bad
kissing
decisions
okay
but
that's
all
that
it
was
you
have
to
let
it
go
what
please
stop
you're
not
a
man
you're
a
thing
don't
touch
me
you're
a
thing
an
evil
disgusting
thing
anya
what
should
we
do
should
we
call
him
it's
like
the
middle
of
last
night
there
or
maybe
it's
tomorrow
anyone
remember
how
that
works
ii
don't
think
we
need
to
resort
to

i
mean
oh
hey
cool
that's
great
will
i
haven't
seen
you
do
that
in
a
long
time
ii
don't
remember
that
part
well
is
it
a
a
supernatural
diamond
you
know
like
healing
powers
or
or
goodlucky
let's
definitely
not
leave
her
alone
in
the
house
too
long
well
maybe
he
doesn't
eat
them
you
know
maybe
he
just

thinks
they're
pretty
we
suck
out
with
amy
i
guess
but
at
least
she's
not
all
cooped
up
and
crying
that's
forward
momentum
now
i
know
that
i
don't

know
everything
that
happened
with
her
and
tara
but
it
i
know
but
ii
think
she'll
be
fine
you
know
it's
it's
willow
she
of
the
level
head
right
she
might
go
crazy
and
start
alphabetizing
everything
that's
not
true
okay
okay
we'll
we'll
keep
an
eye
but
we
can't
assume
that
everybody's
getting
seduced
