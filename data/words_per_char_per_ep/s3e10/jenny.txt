off
the
menu

sorry
for
me

over
it
if
you
wanna
feel
sorry
for
someone
you
should
feel
sorry
for
yourself
oh
but
i
guess
you've
already
got
that
covered
it
wasn't
you
oh
yes
and
what
a
man
you
were
i
don't
wanna
hurt
you
angel
but
you
have
to
understand
cruelty's
the
only
thing
you
ever
had
a
true
talent
for
shh
rest
rest
you
mistake
it
for
a
curse
angel
but
it's
not
it's
your
destiny
i'll
show
you
i'll
show
you
you
want
her
take
her
take
what
you
want
pour
all
that
frustration
and
all
that
guilt
into
her
and
you'll
be
free
you
can't
live
for
eternity
with
all
that
pain
this
is
what
you
are
this
is
why
we
brought
you
back

her
and
then
you'll
be
ready
to
kill
her
she
wants
you
to
touch
her
what
are
you
waiting
for
she

have
to
do
it
what
else

you
almost
smell
her
skin
you
never
were
a
fighter
angel
don't
start
trying
now
sooner
or
later
you
will
drink
her
you
were
born
to
hurt
her
have
you
learned
nothing
as
long
as
you
are
alive
you
don't
have
the
strength
to
kill
yourself
you're
not
supposed
to
die
this
isn't
the
plan
but
it'll
do
