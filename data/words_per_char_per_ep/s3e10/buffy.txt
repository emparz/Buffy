angel
what

it
and
then
he
just
bailed
he

he's
still
kinda
twitchy
when
it
comes
to
the
subject
of
angel

over
it
and

it
evil
angel
angel
angel
please
i
need
for
you
to
get
inside
th
there's
only
a
few
minutes
left
i
don't
have
time
to
explain
this
you
just
have
to
trust
me
that
thing
that
was
haunting
you
showing
you
were
you
don't

credit
for

have
to
get
inside

does
it
matter
you're
weak
everybody
is
everybody
fails
maybe
this
evil
did
bring
you
back
but
if
it
did
it's
because
it
needs
you
and
that
means
that
you
can
hurt
it
angel
you
have
the
power
to
do
real
good
to
make
amends
but
if
you
die
now
then
all
that
you
ever
were
was
a
monster
angel
please
the
sun
is
coming
up
i
won't
you
are
not
staying
here
i
won't
let
you
no
no
what
about
me
i
love
you
so
much
and
i
tried
to
make
you
go
away
i
killed
you
and
it
didn't
help
and
i
hate
it
i
hate
that
it's
so
hard
and
that
you
can
hurt
me
so
much
i
know
everything
that
you
did
because
you
did
it
to
me
oh
god
i
wish
that
i
wished
you
dead
i
don't
i
can't
strong
is
fighting
it's
hard
and
it's
painful
and
it's
every
day
it's
what
we
have
to
do
and
we
can
do
it
together
but
if
you're
too
much
of
a
coward
for
that
then
burn
if
i
can't
convince
you
that
you
belong
in
this
world
then
i
don't
know
what
can
but
do
not
expect
me
to
watch
and
don't
expect
me
to
mourn
for
you
because
