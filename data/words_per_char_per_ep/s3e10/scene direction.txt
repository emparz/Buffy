all
dressed
in
warm
cloaks
a
carriage
goes
by
behind
it
a
very
worriedlooking
young
man
hurries
along
the
street
he
constantly
looks
back
to
see
if
he's
being
followed
he
passes
a
choir
group
singing
silent
night
but
pays
them
no
mind
in
a
more
crowded
area
he
pushes
his
way
through
the
people
eliciting
a
few
comments
on
his
rudeness
suddenly
a
pair
of
arms
reach
out
from
an
alleyway
pull
him
in
and
throw
him
to
the
snowcovered
cobblestones
he
looks
up
to
see
who
his
aggressor
is
and
finds
angelus
standing
over
him
sporting
his
game
face
daniel
afraid
angelus
agreeably
daniel
begs
daniel
frightened
daniel
tries
to
get
up
and
flee
but
angelus
grabs
him
by
the
coat
and
roars
daniel
looking
up
terrified

interrupts
he
bites
him
violently

angel
walks
past
the
shop
window
at
a
brisk
pace
and
crosses
the
street
somewhere
on
the
block
is
a
group
of
carolers
singing
god
rest
ye

gentlemen
angel
passes
a
santa
claus
ringing
a
bell
and
collecting
for
the
salvation
army
a
passerby
drops
some
coins
into
his
pot
angel
stops
short
when
he
unexpectedly
runs
into
buffy
they
are
both
surprised
and
don't
say
anything
for
a
moment
angel
breaks
the
silence
another
awkward
silence
sets
in
for
a
while
buffy
realizes
how
silly
that
sounds
buffy
smiles
buffy
looks
down
at
the
boxes
she's
carrying
angel's
attention
is
diverted
to
behind
buffy
in
the
middle
of
the
street
he
sees
an
apparition
of
daniel
looking
sadly
back
at
him
angel
and
daniel
exchange
a
long
look
then
daniel
walks
away
buffy
notices
angel's
distraction
she
looks
behind
herself
and
sees
nothing
then
turns
her
concerned
attention
back
to
angel
angel
is
frozen
with
fear
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays

school
the
bell
rings
and
students
begin
to
pour
out
of
the
classrooms
into
the
halls
buffy
willow
and
xander
come
out
of
one
and
head
over
to
the
girls'
lockers
the
girls
both
work
their
locker
combinations
xander
gets
a
look
from
buffy
they
both
open
their

and
get
what
they
need
she
takes
off
her
jacket
and
hangs
it
in
her
locker
buffy
takes
a
paper
bag
from
her
locker
and
then
closes
the
door
willow
zips
up
her
book
bag
and
closes
her
locker
as
well
they
all
start
down
the
hall
especially
when
they're
alone
buffy
smiles
they
take
the
steps
up
to
the
couches
cordelia
is
sitting
on

with
a
friend

is
instantly
nervous
buffy
takes
her
bag
over
to
the

out
of

and
putting
them
in

sit
on

heartiness
cordelia
and
her

over
to
the
stairs
and
waits
while
cordelia
hangs
around
to
add
her
point
of
view
cordelia
smiling
smugly
xander
gives
her
a
look
like
he
expected
no
less
from
her
xander
smiles
sarcastically
buffy
joins
the
group
again
she
leaves
wearing
a
shark
smile
wellsatisfied
with
her
results
anyway
forgiveness
is
pretty
much
a
big
theme
with
me
this
year
'cause
of
the
she
stops
when
she
sees
oz
come
up
to
the
group
oz
glances
over
at
xander
who
is
suddenly
quite
uncomfortable
oz
turns
his
attention
to
willow
willow
looks
at
him
hopefully
willow
imploringly
oz
looks
at
her

stands
up
and
smiles
tentatively
oz
stands
up
and
smiles
willow
smiles
more
warmly
willow
looks
at
him
hopefully
oz
smiles
they
step
closer
to
each
other
and
hug
tightly
oz
with
one
arm
around
her
back
and
the
other
gently
caressing
her
head
while
willow
holds
onto
him
as
tightly
as
she
can
enfolding
him
in
her
arms
off
to

buffy
gives
in
joyce
interrupts
joyce
takes
a
deep
breath
she
goes
off
to
her
right
buffy
sighs
and
continues
looking
she
notices
an
area
where
a
bunch
of
the
trees
are
all
brown
and
walks
over
to
them
for
a
closer
look
the
tree
merchant
comes
up
to
her
joyce
from
a
distance
buffy
goes
to
see
what
her
mother
has
found
suddenly
the
view
angles
up
from
the
table
and
into
the
face
of
one
of
the
three
figures
it
has
no
eyes
but
instead
has
runes
branded
in
the
flesh
where
eyes
should
be

is
a
knock
at

dismayingly
buffy
steps
toward
the

but
looks
around
and

has
strung
up
around
the

with
her

back
to
the
days
before

and
drinking
pulling

are
lying
in

caress
each
other
for
several
moments

are
several
sudden
flashes
of
light

removes
his
hands
from

thunderclap
is
heard
grabs
buffy's
wrists
hard
forcibly
pinning
her
down
to
the

the
priests
sitting
around
it
the
priests
get
up
and
buffy
jumps
down
to
fight
them
she
swings
the
handle
of
her
ax
into
one
priest's
stomach
and
he
goes
down
she
swings
it
into
another
one
who
doubles
over
she
follows
up
with
another
swing
to
his
head
and
he
goes
down
too
the
third
one
runs
away
buffy
uses
the
ax
to
destroy
the
arrangement
of
artifacts
on
the
table
the
next
thing
she
knows
jenny
is
in
the
cave
with
her
buffy
hesitates
at
first
surprised
to
see
jenny
there
but
quickly
realizes
that
it's
not
really
her
buffy
defiantly
buffy
loses
her
patience
the
first
jenny
unimpressed
buffy
dripping
with
sarcasm
the
apparition
of
jenny
shrinks
and
is
replaced
for
an
instant
by
an
image
of
a
huge
horned
and
clawed
beast
coming
at
her
roaring
and
with
eyes
glowing
red
it
fades
as
quickly
as
it
appeared
buffy
stares
in
shock
at
the
place
where
it
appeared
it
screams
a
final
warning
buffy
runs
from
the
cave
terrified
for
angel's
life
he
hears
her
say
his
name
and
briefly
glances
in
her
direction
before
looking
back
out
over
the
rooftops
buffy
slowly
walks
over
to
him
buffy
out
of
breath
buffy
anxiously
and
hurried
angel
interrupts
buffy
confused
buffy
insistently
angel
harshly
buffy
desperately
angel
raises
his
voice
he
sobs
buffy
is
at
a
loss
for
words
angel
doesn't
want
to
believe
her
buffy
pleadingly
buffy
raises
her
voice
she
looks
out
at
the
sky
as
it
begins
to
lighten
buffy
begging
frantically
buffy
grabs
his
arm
he
jerks
his
arm
free
of
her
grasp
in
her
anger
and
desperation
buffy
punches
him
he
reacts
by
shoving
her
away
from
him
roughly
making
her
fall
face
forward
hard
to
the
ground
angel
quietly
to
himself
he
goes
to
her
and
crouches
over
her
grabbing
her
by
the
shoulders
and
turning
her
around
to
face
him
buffy
fears
his
intentions
and
cries
out
he
grabs
her
roughly
by
the
arms
and
holds
her
firmly
angel
shakes
her
angel
shakes
her
buffy
tearfully
she
shoves
him
off
of
her
and
gets
up
buffy
crying
buffy
sobs
then
harshly
buffy
whispers
angel
gets
up
now
too
angel
struggles
with
himself
knowing
she's
right
buffy
resolvedly
that
doesn't
help
so
he
reflexively
pulls
the
flap
closed
over
his
head
fallen
snow
and
all
this
wakes
him
up
and
a
moment
later
he
pushes
back
the
flap
and
looks
up
in
wonder
at
the
falling
snow
weatherman
about
3c
the
camera
pans
down
into
the
street
which
is
deserted
except
for
buffy
and
angel
who
walk
along
handinhand
still
looking
up
at
the
snow
as
it
comes
down
