just
a
minute
hello
sorry
coming
from
you
that
phrase
strikes
me
as
rather
funny
'sorry
to
bother
me'
angel
i
need
your
help
and
the
funny
keeps
on
coming
alright
i'm
aware
of
that
come
in
here
back
on
earth
i
don't
feel
particularly
inclined
to
argue
with
that
knowing
why
you
were
back
would
give
you
peace
of
mind
you
think
that's
something
you
ought
to
have
because
sir
to
be
blunt
the
last
time
you
became
complacent
about
your
existence
turned
out
rather
badly
what
who
you
had
a
dream
about
angel
i'm
not
sure
that's
i
know
i've
seen
him
he
wanted
to
know
why
he
was
back
uh
possibly
ii've
been
looking
yes
well
we
start
not
surprisingly
with
research
xander
um
the
black
chronicles
and
uh
buffy
the
diary
of
lucious
temple
an
acolyte
of
acathla
expert
on
demons
you
can
skip
the
passages
on
his
garden
unless
you're
keen
on
growing
heartier
beets
here
buffy
take
a
look
these
letters
contain
references
to
a
a
an
ancient
power
known
as
the
first
evil
absolute
evil
older
than
man
than
demons
it
could
have
had
the
power
to
bring
angel
back
you
had
another
dream
with
angel
what
happened
um
they're
known
as
the
uh
as
the
bringers
ooor
harbingers
they're
high
priests
of
the
first
they
uh
they
can
conjure
spirit
manifestations
and
set
them
on
people
influence
them
haunt
them
yyou
can't
fight
the
first
buffy
it's
not
aa
physical
being
i'm
still
not
sure
what
let's
not
lose
our
heads
look
you
realize
if
he
truly
becomes
a
danger
you
may
have
to
kill
him
again
can
you
do
that
yes
ah
um
yes
but
uh
more
more
posturing
i'm
afraid
um
'for
they
are
the
harbingers
of
death
nothing
shall
grow
above
or
below
them
no
seed
shall
flower
neither
in
man
nor'
they're
rebels
and
they'll
never
ever
be
any
good
nothing
specific
about
their
haunts
what
