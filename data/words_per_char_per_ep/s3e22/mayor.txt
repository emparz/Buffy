it's
your
day
well
i'd
get
set
for
some
weeping
if
i
were
you
i'd
get
set
for
a
world
of
pain
misery
loves
company
young
man
and
i'm
looking
to
share
that
with
you
and
your
whore
looks
like
somebody
has
been
eating
his
spinach
no
it's
okay
folks
it's
all
right
the
show's
not
over
but
there
will
be
a
short
intermission
don't
want
to
miss
the
second
act
all
kinds
of
excitement
…how
it's
going
to
lay
out
the
transformation
should
begin
at
exactly
328
i'll
just
be
finishing
my
speech

you
know
it's
too
bad
you
fellows
have
to
miss
that
because
i
think
it
speaks
to
every
one
of
us
i
mean
heck
i've
been
working
on
it
for
a
hundred
years
it
better
be
good
they'll
try
to
run
of
course
and
this
is
when
i'll
need
you
boys
in
flanking
position
not
a
problem
you
come
up
through
the
sewers
here
the
important
thing
is
containment
i'll
need
to
feed
it's
crucial
in
the
first
few
minutes
to
sustain
the
change
what
does
that
mean
no
snacking
i
see
blood
on
your
lips
it's
a
visit
to
the
wood
shed
for
you
boys
kill
don't
feed
remember
fast
and
brutal
it's
going
to
be
a
whole
new
world
come
nightfall
don't
want
to
weaken
now
and
boys

let's
watch
the
swearing
well
what
a
day
this
is

special
day
today
is
our
centennial
the
one
hundreds
anniversary
of
the
founding
of
sunnydale
and
i
know
what
that
means
to
all
you
kids
not

a
darn
thing
because
today
something
much
more
important
happens
today
you
all
graduate
from
high
school
today
all
the
pain
all
the
work
all
the
excitement
is
finally
over
and
what's
a
hundred
years
of
history
compared
to
that
you
know
what
kids
…
for
all
of
you
it
may
be
that
there
is
a
place
in
sunnydale's
history
whether
you
like
it
or
not
it's
been
a
long
road
getting
here
for
you…
for
sunnydale
there
has
been
achievement
joy
good
times…
and
there
has
been
grief
there's
been
loss
some
people
who
should
be
here
today…
aren't
but
we
are

journey's
end
and
what
is
a
journey
is
it
just…
distance
traveled
time
spent
no
it's
what
happens
on
the
way
it's
the
things
that
happen
to
you
at
the
end
of
the
journey
you're
not
the
same
today
is
about
change
graduation
doesn't
just
mean
your
circumstances
change
it
means
you
do
you
ascend…
to
a
higher
level
nothing
will
ever
be
the
same
nothing
and
so
as
we
look
back
on…
on
the
events
that
brought
us
to
this
day
we…
we
must
all…
it
has
begun
my
destiny
it's
a
little
sooner
than
i
expected
i
had
this
whole
section
on
civic
pride…
but
i
guess
we'll
just
skip
to
the
big
finish
well
gosh
