bumps
into
the

then
stumbles
and
catches
himself
on
the
sofa
table
spilling
a
pewter
pitcher
and
plate
onto
the
floor
buffy
grabs

by

still
doesn't
go
down

it
takes
him
a

longer
to
come
back
up
buffy
hits
him
a
third
time
and
this
time
angel
spins
back
with
a
growl
vamped
out
he
just
stands
there
staring
at
her
while

pulls
down
the

strap
of

by
the
hair
at
the
back
of
his
head

looks
at

for
a
moment
then
firmly
pulls
his
head
down
against

neck
and
holds
him
there
for
a
moment

remain
like

bites
down

gasps
with
the
pain

some
blood
is
running
out
beneath

and
running
down
her
shoulder
buffy's
face
scrunches
up
she
mouths
what
looks
like
'oh

and
slowly
sinks
backwards
to
the

lying
on

reaches
out
and
finds
the
pewter
pitcher
she
crushes
it
in
her
hand
the
camera
keeps
jerking
around
the
whole
time
and
buffy
is
clearly
not
enjoying
the
experience
she
puts
her
hands
against
his
sides
as
if
she
was
going
to
push
him
off
but
kicks
out
with
her
left
leg
instead
breaking
the
sofa
table
in
half
she
stares
up
into
the
camera
a
tear
in
the
corner
of
her
left
eye
then
her
eyes
drift
shut
and
her
head
sinks
to
the
side
just
as

finally
rolls
off

panting
his
face
morphs
back
