i
know
how
you
feel
maybe
i
can
help
he's
a
man
look
no
further
well

it
isn't
always
about
looks
or
a
beating
heart
sometimes
intimate
sweaty
relations
with
the
wrong
person
just
seems
like
a
good
idea
at
the
time
likes
'em
fleshy
huh
bet
you
wish
he'd
bloat
up
a
coupla
thousand
pounds
and
pop
like
a
big
ol'
meat
zeppelin
don't
you
oh
gee
then
he
must
have
meant
it
'cause
hey
guys
never
say
anything
they
don't
really
mean
do
they
and
then
you
get
all
excited
with
the
tingly
anticipation
but
wait
not
so
fast
there's
the
apocalypse
aand
the
back
from
the
grave
and
the
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
and
by
the
time
you're
finally
standing
there
in
that
beautiful
expensive
white
dress
you've
dreamed
about
ever
since
you
became
human
he's
gets
all
heebiejeebie
and
decides
you
know
i'd
rather
just
go
steady
beat
the
other
woman
has
stopped
crying
now
she
just
looks
bitter
