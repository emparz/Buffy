i
know
how
you
feel
maybe
i
can
help
he's
a
man
look
no
further
well

it
isn't
always
about
looks
or
a
beating
heart
sometimes
intimate
sweaty
relations
with
the
wrong
person
just
seems
like
a
good
idea
at
the
time
likes
'em
fleshy
huh
bet
you
wish
he'd
bloat
up
a
coupla
thousand
pounds
and
pop
like
a
big
ol'
meat
zeppelin
don't
you
oh
gee
then
he
must
have
meant
it
'cause
hey
guys
never
say
anything
they
don't
really
mean
do
they
they
say
i
love
you
and
and
you
think
it's
true
they
say
oh
anya
i
want
to
be
with
you
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
and
you
believe
them
you
believe
they
feel
the
same
way
about
you
because
that's
the
way
love's
supposed
to
be
right
and
then
you
get
all
excited
with
the
tingly
anticipation
but
wait
not
so
fast
there's
the
apocalypse
aand
the
back
from
the
grave
and
the
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
and
by
the
time
you're
finally
standing
there
in
that
beautiful
expensive
white
dress
you've
dreamed
about
ever
since
you
became
human
he's
gets
all
heebiejeebie
and
decides
you
know
i'd
rather
just
go
steady
and
you
know
he
said
it
isn't
me
but
how
can
i
believe
him
i
mean

he
knew
he
didn't
want
to
get
married
deep
down
he
knew
but
he
lied
to
me
every
day
for
months
he
lied
and
lied
and
then
lied
some
more
'cause
hey

who's
gonna
notice
with
all
the
other
lies
flying
around
like
little
monkeys
and
then
he
thinks
he
can
just
sweep
the
carnage
underneath
the
rug
by
saying

oh
