the
interior
of
the
geek
trio's
lair
still
decorated
in
cheesy
lovepad
fashion
but
empty
of
people
buffy
looks
quite
displeased
she
walks
down
the
stairs
into
the
lair
looks
around
she
wanders
over
to
a
desk
there's
an
imac
and
a
bunch
of
papers
on
it
buffy
frowns
picks
up
some
of
the
papers
looks
around
more
pan
over
a
variety
of
geektype
knickknacks
and
such
she
looks
at
a

where
a
bunch
of
action
figures
are
set
up

mostly
of
women
in
extremely
skimpy
outfits
buffy
pokes

she
gets
distracted
by
more
piles
of
paper
and
stuff
on
a
chair
she
sifts
through
them
picks
some
up
frowns
continues
walking
she
discovers
the
whiteboard
on
which
the
nerd
herd
had
written
their
evil
plans
buffy
turns
it
on
its
squeaky
axle
to
reveal
the
surface
all
it
says
now
is
too
late
buffy
frowns
suddenly
a
huge
circular
buzzsaw
cuts
through
the
whiteboard
and
comes
slicing
toward
buffy
cutting
through
everything
in
its
path
sawdust
and
debris
flying
everywhere
buffy
shields
her
face
with
her
hands
dives
to
the
floor
just
in

to
avoid
being
sliced
in

several
more

appear
at

some
horizontally
some

some
on

buffy
does
a
flip
to
duck
under

and
over

grabs
a

of
random
papers
and

and
runs
for

gets
caught
in
