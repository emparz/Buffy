didn't
go
to
anya
for
that
i
was
looking
for
a
spell
it
wasn't
for
you
i
wanted
something

anything
to
make
these
feelings
stop
i
just
wanted
it
to

feel
it
squirming
in
my
head

bits
and
chunks

used
to
be
so
clear
slayer
vampire
vampire
kills
slayer
sucks
her
dry
picks
his
teeth
with
her
bones
it's
always
been
that
way
i've
tasted
the
life
of
two
slayers
but
with
buffy
it
isn't
supposed
to
be
this
way
it's
the
chip
steel
and
wires
and
silicon
it
won't
let
me
be
a
monster
and
i
can't
be
a
man
i'm
nothing
yeah
they
do
if
you
make
them
get
nice
and
comfy
