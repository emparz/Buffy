when
did
morning
happen
mmm
i
forgot
how
good
this
could
feel
us
together
without
the
magic
it's
getting
late
no
oh
god
no
i
was
just
thinking
about
buffy
i
didn't
hear
her
she
wouldn't
talk
about
what
happened
at
the
magic
shop
when
she
got
home
last
night
she
just
wanted
to
know
how
close
i
was
to
tracing
the
camera
signal
back
to
the
empire
of
the
nerds
and
then
she
left
again
yeah
i'm
not
really
worried
about
her
going
up
against
warren
and
the
others
i
know
this
is
going
to
sound
crazy
but

i
think
something
might
be
going
on
with
spike
and
buffy
i
mean
she
looked
so
hurt
when
she
saw
him
with
anya
i
think
maybe
tara
they've
been
sleeping
together
no
i
wouldn't
go
that
far
sleeping
together
you
mean
like
the
naked
kind
of
together
does
everybody
else
know
am
i
the
only
one
she
didn't
tara
god
no
she
she
didn't
even
mean
to
tell
me
it
just
came
out
how
could
she
hide
something
like
this
from
me
oh
no
i'm
not

i'm
just
trying
to
understand
wow
she
probably
really
needs
someone
to
talk
to
buffy
uh
not
yet
i'm
sure
she'll
be
home
soon
everything's
fine
just
go
back
to
bed
oh
uh
she
told
you
about
spike
yeah
i
totally
knew
it's
gonna
be
all
right
it's
just

complicated
you
know
when
when
people
have
such
strong
feelings
for
each
other
sometimes
tara
is
she
back
yet
okay
we're
here
ready
for
action
uh
bad
guy
fighting
action
super
okay
all
right
we'll
stop
we
should
go
back
uh
tara
and
i
can
sherlock
around
buffy
there's
nothing
left
there
now
giant
buzz
saw
it
was
a
thing
this
was
all
that
i
could
save
i
i
know
it's
not
much
but
we
need
to
go
through
it
and
see
if
we
can
find
anything
that
might
tell
us
what
what
they're
doing
where
they're
going
should
we
call
xander
it's
all
a
mess
sure
we'll
decipher
codes
foil
evil
schemes
i
was
with
you
up
until
there
whoa
uh
one
of
their
data
cds
it's
filled
with
encrypted
blueprints
schematics
i'm
not
sure
the
designations
have
been
stripped
would
that
involve
getting
up
then
i'm
coming
out
firmly
against
it
well
i'm
kinda
busy
working
on
my
own
hey
i
think
we
finally
have
something
she
pauses
seeing
xander's
bloody
face
and
buffy's
bruised
condition
buffy
quickly
pulls
her
robe
down
to
hide
the
bruise
on
her
leg
what
happened
we
were
able
to
decipher
pretty
much
everything
except
these
it
was
filled
with
encoded
blueprints
and
schematics
they're
looking
to
score
some
serious
dinero
we
don't
think
they're
planning
just
one
job
you
don't
have
to
we
think
there's
one
they
may
hit
tonight
hey
clothes
hmm
yes
ma'am
okay
not
quite
the
response
i
was
fishing
for
think
they're
making
up
tara
tara
baby
baby
come
on
get
up
no
no
