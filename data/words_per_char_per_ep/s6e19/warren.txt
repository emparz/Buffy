word
for
me

screwing
a
dead
guy
you
hit
like
a
girl

see
how
popular
you
are
without
a
face
we
go
when
i'm
ready

your
lucky
night

bring
her
on
i
was
wondering
when
super
bitch
would
show
up
nothing
i
can't
handle
that
all
you
got
what's
the
matter
baby
you
never
fight
a
real
man
before

almost
hurt
kitten

who
i
am
huh

too
but
more
to
the
point
buffy
swings
at
him
he
blocks
the
punch
and
backhands
her
and
it's
not
the
muscles
baby
it's
the
brains
whoa
sparky
i
didn't
think
you
had
it
in
you
say
good
night
bitch
get
away
from
me
you
think
you
can
just
do
that
to
me

think

let
you
get
away
with
that
think
again
