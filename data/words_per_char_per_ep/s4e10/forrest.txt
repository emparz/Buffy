well
you
can't
this
is
the
burden
we
bear
brother
we
have
a
gig
that
would
inevitably
cause
any
girl
living
to
think
we
are
cool
upon
cool
yet
we
must
clark
kent
our
way
through
the
dating
scene
never
to
use
our
unfair
advantage
thank
god
we're
pretty
you
think
she's
special
wow
the
first
486
times
you
told
me
it
didn't
register
but
now
i
'see'
that
you
think
she's
special
then
get
with
the
kissing
it's
all
over
town
