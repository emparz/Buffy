oh
i
just
want
to
believe

can
you
hear
me

can
you
see
me

what's
inside
of
me

oh
i
just
want
to
believe

if
my
life
can
have
a
purpose

help
me
to
believe

oh
i
just
want
to
believe

can
you
hear
me

can
you
see
me

what's
inside
of
me

oh
i
just
want
to
believe

if
my
life
can
have
a
purpose

help
me
to
believe
everybody
wants
to
find
the
circle

the
line
of
truth
that
has
no
end

because
so
many
nights
i've
slept
with
the
feeling
of
empty

and
i
say
right
now
i'm
ready
to
believe
i
feel
love
with
my
friends

i
feel
love
in
my
songs

if
i
could
just
hold
love

then
all
the
answers
might
come

i
said
oh
if
we're
all
children
of
god

and
we
just
turned
away

i
got
a
lack
of
belief

i
said
a
world
without
faith

it's
time
we
turn
back
around
we're
formed
in
liquid

pushed
out
still
dripping

a
world
was
thrown
before
my
eyes
now
paint
a
picture

crayon
stick
figures

with
bluehaired
people
purple
skies
