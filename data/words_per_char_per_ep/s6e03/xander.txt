that
look
you're
just
covering
don't
tell
me
you're
not
happy
look
me
in
the
eyes
and
tell
me
when
you
saw
buffy
alive
that
wasn't
the
happiest
moment
of
your
entire
existence
huh
what
do
what
hello
attacked
a
vampire
in
the
house
all
right
willow
you
need
to
get
out
of
there
just
get
everyone
out
wake
up
buffy
and
dawn
don't
make
a
big
deal
gah
anya
anya
very
bad
very
very
very
bad
bad
a
hitchhiker
okay
fine
but

what
are
we
gonna
do
i
mean
i'm
feeling
the
need
for
some
vigorous
doing
you
know
can
we
do
that
kill
it
buff
yeah
this
thing
this
haunting
thing
we'll
fix
it
and
then
we'll
still
have
you
back
which
is

it's
so
important
demons
that
might
have
come
out
of
hell
at
the
same
time
buffy
did
so
should
we
concentrate
on
how
to
kill
those
or
should
we
try
to
find
more
uh
do
you
want
us
to
go
with
you
fire
fire
fire
is
she
okay
yeah
it's
gone
it's
getting
light
out
buffy's
probably
on
her
way
home
from
patrolling
hey
tara
this
is
probably
crazy

but
spike
got
me
to
thinking
this
spell
we
did

it's
having
consequences
isn't
it
i
mean

it
sure
seems
like
it
and
i
was
just
wondering

did
you
know
that
this
might
happen
do
you
think

could
someone
have
known
i
know
i
know
huh
backing
off
quickly
hands
in
the
air
i
just
meant
we
made
a
demon
bad
us
so
we
need
to
uncreate
it
right
we
need
to
send
it
the
rest
of
the
way
out
of
our
world
we
will
what
is
thanks
for
the
tip
i
can't
i
did
not
send
the
demon
i
was
possessed
the
demon
used
me
to
eavesdrop
on
our
conversation
oodgay
ideayay
anyay
it's
okay
dawnie
willow
and
tara
are
doing
a
spell
no
of
course
not
it's
just
that
she
can't
fight
this
thing
if
it's
all

misty
so
they
make
it
more
solid
so
buffy
can
kick
its
fully
embodied
ass
hey
you
get
dawn
off
to
school
all
right
'cause
i
was
thinking
if
you
need
help
picking
her
up
i
welcome
home
buffy
