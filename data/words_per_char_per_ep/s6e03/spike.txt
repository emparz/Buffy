pike

you
there
thank
god
you
scared
me
half
to
death

or
more
to
death
you

i
could
kill
you
i
mean
it
i
could
rip
your
head
off
onehanded
and
drink
from
your
brain
stem
yeah
i've
seen
the
bloody
bot
before
didn't
think
she'd
patch
up
so
he
breaks
off
staring
at
buffy
she
continues
down
the
stairs
returning
his
gaze
i'm

what
did
you
do
her
hands
i
do
clawed
her
way
out
of
a
coffin
that's
how
isn't
that
right
done
it
myself
um

we'll
take
care
of
you
come
here
get
some
stuff
uh
mercurochrome
bandages
hundred
fortyseven
days
yesterday
uh

hundred
fortyeight
today
'cept
today
doesn't
count
does
it
how
long
was
it
for
you

where
you
were
you
didn't
tell
me
you
brought
her
back
and
you
didn't
tell
me
i
worked
beside
you
all
summer
listen
i've
figured
it
out
maybe
you
haven't
but
i
have
willow
knew
there
was
a
chance
that
she'd
come
back
wrong
so
wrong
that
you'd
have

that
she
would
have
to
get
rid
of
what
came
back
and
i
wouldn't
let
her
if
any
part
of
that
was
buffy
i
wouldn't
let
her
and
that's
why
she
shut
me
out
oh
is
that
right
that's
the
thing
about
magic
there's
always
consequences
always
buffy
you
should
be
careful
never
know
what
kind
of
villain's
got
a
knife
at
your
back
hmm
same
with
you
willow's
getting
pretty
strong
isn't
she
bringing
you
back
it's
hard
to
get
a
good
night's
death
around
here
you
can
sit
down
got
furniture
you
should
see
the
downstairs
too
it's
quite
posh
uh

i
do
remember
what
i
said
the
promise
to
protect
her
if
i
had
done
that

even
if
i
didn't
make
it

you
wouldn't
have
had
to
jump
but
i
want
you
to
know
i
did
save
you
not
when
it
counted
of
course
but

after
that
every
night
after
that
i'd
see
it
all
again

do
something
different
faster
or
more
clever
you
know
dozens
of
times
lots
of
different
ways

every
night
i
save
you
buffy
i
was
gonna
go
inside
but
i
overheard
you
and
the
superfriends
exchanging
a
special
moment
and
i
came
over
a
bit
queasy
say
aren't
you
leaving
a
hole
in
the
middle
of
some
soggy
group
hug
oh
uh
right
then
thanks
ever
so
buff

slayer
are
you
okay
buffy
if
you're
in

if
you're
in
pain

or
if
you
need
anything
or
if
i
can
do
anything
for
you
well
i
haven't
been
to
a
hell
dimension
just
of
late
but
i
do
know
a
thing
or
two
about
torment
