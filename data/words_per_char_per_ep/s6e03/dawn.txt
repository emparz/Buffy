that
if
you
think
you
can
give
her
back
to
me
and
then
take
her
away
again
no
that's
worse
than
if
you'd
never
brought
her
back
you
can't
mess
with
people's
lives
this
way
how
can
you
let
her
do
this
how
can
you
even
talk
about
letting
her
go

could
drive
faster

i
can't
drive
stop
talking

in
pig
latin
and
drive
buffy's
in
trouble
you
sure
it
won't
send
buffy

of
thing

what's
wrong
you
made
me
lunch
wow
thanks
thank
you

care
about
you
a
lot
when
you
were
gone

it
was
bad
when
you
were
gone
but
it'll
be
better
now
now
that
they
can
see
you
being
happy
that's
all
they
want
