you
aren't
wearing
a
green
apron
sorry
i
just
mean
you
don't
work
here
right
lissa
and
i
guess
i
could
use
some
advice
i
can't
even
figure
out
if
i've
got
the
right
kind
of
rope
i
have
a
kayak
sorry
i
need
to
store
my
kayak
so
i
was
thinking
maybe
i
could
sorta
suspend
it
from
the
ceiling
in
the
garage
with
ropes
and
a
pulley
or
a
winch
thing
what
you
said
830
right
did
you
think
i
was
going
to
stand
you
up
what
it's
hot
cocoa
hey
who
wants
macho
i
like
that
you
like
hot
cocoa
redeye
please
sounded
good
and
you
still
have
to
see
her
like
everyday
how
is
that
a
good
thing
i
mean
it
seems
like
she
never
let
you
forget
what
happened
and
if
you'd
gone
ahead
and
married
her
even
though
you
had
doubts
that
would've
been
better
sounds
to
me
like
in
the
long
run
you're
both
better
off
i
know
it
turned
out
good
for
me
and
that's
what
really
matters
right
well
i
can
think
of
something
fun
to
do
thanks
for
your
help
selecting
the
ropes
the
one
i
picked
wasn't
strong
enough
who's
buffy
you
know
the
slayer
you
just
seem
like
a
nice
guy
that's
all
and
i
wanted
to
get
to
know
you
sure
do
the
ropes
hurt
good
the
seal
opens
and
a
vicious
feral
vampire
creature
comes
out
the
end
is
coming
the
final
fight
and
everyone
is
hearing
the
drumbeat
it's
telling
us
to
pick
our
partners
align
ourselves
with
the
good
or
the
evil
couldn't
have
done
it
without
you
xander
thanks
for
the
great
date
