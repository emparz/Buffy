you
look
good
i
give
you
a
compliment
and
you
don't
say
thank
you
did
i
raise
you
that
way
well
i
was
dead
'cause
you've
been
coming
up
in
the
world—taking
the
demons
out
it
makes
a
mother
proud
would
you
like
to
know
who
killed
me
i
know
you
went
looking
for
him
is
that
right
well
you
can
check
it
out
after
i
tell
you
check
the
timing
reread
what
the
witnesses
said
and
the
people
in
the
subway
station—
you
met
him
you
know
him
you
fought
at
his
side
now
what
do
you
say
