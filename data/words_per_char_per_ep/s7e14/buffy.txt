spike
well
uh
when
we
were
at
the
initiative
right
either
repair
the
chip
or
to
remove
it
yeah
it
really
is
ok
ah
you
just
heard
the
horror
stories
wear
hoops
they'll
catch
on
something
rip
your
lobe
off
lobes
flying
everywhere
you
mean
spike
not
having
a
chip
free
range
spike
guess
it
was
instinct
like
you
were
talking
about
and
the
principal
oh
nothing
much
he
was
in
the
school
basement
holding
a
shovel
acting
evasive
plus
he's
got
that
whole
too
charming
to
be
real
thing
going
on
i'm
looking
into
it
nothing's
changed
giles
spike
had
a
chip
before
remember
when
the
first
had
him
kill
and
sire
all
those
people
spike
has
a
soul
now
that's
what's
gonna
stop
him
from
hurting
people
he
can
be
a
good
man
giles
i
feel
it
but
he's
never
gonna
get
there
if
we
don't
give
him
the
chance
we
haven't—
things
have
been
different
since
he
came
back
you
think
i'm
losing
sight
of
the
big
picture
but
i'm
not
when
spike
had
that
chip
it
was
like
having
him
in
a
muzzle
it
was
wrong
you
can't
beat
evil
by
doing
evil
i
know
that
now
if
i
were
a
sign
of
being
evil
where
would
i
be
principal
wood
it's
you
file
folders
and
mechanical
pencils
well
i
want
to
write
on
a
file
folder
with
a
mechanical
pencil
oh
this
isn't
a
supply
cabinet
my
bad
ok
thanks
yeah
preparing
for
tomorrow's
counseling
sessions
watching
a
reality
show
about
a
millionaire
sure
i'd
be
happy
to
have
dinner
with
you
yeah
isn't
that
weird
i
mean
he's
a
principal
he's
a
young
hot
principal
with
earrings
but
he's
a
principal
why
do
you
think
he
asked
me
out
i
mean
he
could
be
interested
right
or
it
could
be
workrelated
maybe
i'm
getting
promoted
for
doing
such
a
good
job
or
maybe
he
knows
that
i
suspect
he's
up
to
something
and
he's
taking
me
out
to
kill
me
you
know
it's
not
even
that
he's
acting
that
suspicious
it's
just—there
he
is
on
the
hell
mouth
all
day
every
day
that's
got
to
be
like
being
showered
with
evil
only
from
underneath
a
bidet
like
a
bidet
of
evil
i
don't
know
he's
goodlooking
and
he's—he's
solid
he's
smart
he's
normal
so
not
the
wicked
energy
which
is
nice
'cause
i
don't
want
to
only
be
attracted
to
wicked
energy
or
what
if
he
is
wicked
in
which
case
is
that
why
i'm
attracted
to
him
you
know
what
yeah
i
mean
i
think
i
like
him
and
he'd
be
good
for
me
why
does
everybody
in
this
house
think
i'm
still
in
love
with
spike
oh
hey
someone's
here
sorry
if
it
makes
you
feel
better
it's
principal
wood
and
i
think
he's
aligned
with
the
first
yay
someone
who
doesn't
remember
the
industrial
revolution
watch
it
or
i'm
gonna
make
you
talk
about
your
new
girlfriend
who
you
hold
hands
with
under
the
dinner
table
and
think
we
don't
notice
what'd
she
say
hey
will
do
you
think
you
can
do
a
computer
check
on
principal
wood
see
if
you
can
find
anything
out
well
it
is
unclear
that's
why
i
chose
a
top
that
says
you
know
i'm
comfortable
in
a
stodgy
office
or
a
swinging
casual
setting—or
killing
you
you
know
if
you're
a
demon
thanks
for
trying
well
it's
not
working
um
i
should
really
go
find
something
else
to
wear
oh
thanks
uh
traditionally
one
wears
something
over
this
well
it's
unclear
i
mean
i
have
this
whole
theory
about
a
promotion
or
he's
evil
you
don't
have
to—
good
i'm
glad
thank
you
you
should
try
this
too
the
going
out
thing
i
mean
i
mean
there's
that
girl
you
brought
to
anya
and
xander's
notawedding
yeah
i
can
see
that
i
should
go
i
don't
wanna
be
late
this
isn't
right
well
it
is
one
of
the
nicer
dark
alleys
ok
as
they
walk
down
the
alley
a
vampire
steps
out
in
front
of
them
then
two
more
step
up
behind
them
growling
buffy
starts
fighting
them
immediately
there's
a
horde
of
them
now
she
manages
to
punch
them
and
kick
them
away
from
her
one
by
one
until
she
has
opportunity
to
get
her
stake
out
of
her
purse
she
stakes
one
then
another
then
another
you
set
me
up
you
son
of
a—
what
this
place
is
nice
how
the
hell
did
you
do
that
so
you're
freelance
and
you
know
who
i
am
right
ok
um
so
i'm
guessing
that
you
don't
work
in
an
office
15
feet
above
the
hell
mouth
because
you
enjoy
educational
administration
so
yyou
didn't
hire
me
for
my
counseling
skills
whwhy
didn't
you
tell
me
about
you
yyou
didn't
think
you
could
trust
me
and
now
you
are
so
you
knew
who
i
was
before
you
even
came
here
how
how
do
you
know
about
slayers
your
mother—
wow
i
didn't
know
that
any
slayers
had
children
um
something
got
her
a
demon—
no
not
most
of
them
um
so
do
you
have
any
slayer
powers
i'm
sorry
i—i'm
just
so
floored
ii
have
no
idea
what
to
ask
so
you
decided
to
tell
me
in
a
darkened
little
romantic
french
restaurant
oh
my
god
mmm
oh
my
god
that
might
be
the
best
thing
i've
ever
had
in
my
mouth
mm
what
are
you
doing
here
you
sure
he's
in
the
high
school
how
much
longer
'til
we
get
there
he
works
with
me
uh
you
know
in
the
struggle
against
evil
xander
hey
hey
xand
i'm
here
what
if
you
just
start
attracting
male
demons
willow
did
the
first
is
back
in
the
mix
no
you
have
to
stay
that's
not
why
i
need
you
here
'cause
i'm
not
ready
for
you
to
not
be
here
