uh
buffy
you
looking
for
something
the
supply
cabinet
in
the
outer
office
has
those
things
hey
buffy
um
what're
you
doing
tonight
no
really
well
then
i'd
um—
i'd
like
to
take
you
out
to
dinner
if
that's
all
right
with
you
i
mean
you
don't
have
to
i'm
certainly
not
saying
come
to
dinner
if
you
enjoy
having
a
job
you
know
i
may
have
to
make
up
a
document
saying
i
didn't
just
say
that
and
have
you
sign
it
great
i'll
draw
up
the
paperwork
i
know
it
doesn't
look
promising
but
i
swear
this
place
is
great
it's
the
best
kept
secret
in
town
it's
just
right
down
this
way
i
promise
you
it's
just
a
little
bit
further
i
guess
we
should
talk
the
restaurant's
right
there
thank
you
i've
had
a
little
practice
never
took
on
two
at
once
before
but
i
have
taken
out
a
vamp
here
or
there
and
some
demons
hm
freelance—
i
guess
that's
a
good
way
to
put
it
you're
the
slayer
well
i
actually
do
enjoy
the
work
but
yeah
yeah
you're
right
i
maneuvered
myself
into
that
school
that
office—just
like
i
maneuvered
you
there
the
hell
mouth
draws
the
bad
things
in
close
and
now
we're
headed
for
something
big
buffy
really
big
and
i
need
to
be
here
when
it
happens
i
want
to
help
they're
valuable
too
i
wasn't
sure
about
things
yet
no
no
no
i
wasn't
sure
i
was
ready
yet—ready
to
jump
into
this
fight
well
now
the
fight
is
starting—or
starting
to
start—and
i
don't
have
time
to
worry
anymore
i
have
to
do
something
yes
right
ok
see
when
i
was
a
little
boy
my
mother
was
one
the
one
actually—the
slayer
well
i
don't
know
of
any
others
she
was
killed
when
i
was
four
i
still
remember
her
but
it's
a
littlefuzzy
you
know
a
vampire
oh
man
i
went
through
this
whole
avenging
son
phase
in
my
twenties
but
i
never
found
him
so
now
i
just
dust
as
many
of
them
as
i
can
find
i
figure
eventually
i'll
get
him
that's
probably
why
we
got
jumped
outside
i'm
not
very
popular
with
the
bumpyforeheaded
crowd
and
i
bet
you
aren't
either
no
i
don't
have
powers
no
superstrength
or
mythic
responsibilities
i'm
just
a
guy
with
a
few
skills
'cause
her
watcher
took
me
in
and
raised
me
that's
right
um
yeah
yeah
i'm
not
really
sure
how
that
happened
but
yeah
isn't
it
good
they
soak
the
pears
in
brandy
here
you
need
a
bite
with
sauce
is
there
a
problem
i'm
not
surprised
that
school's
at
the
center
of
everything
ten
minutes
so
how
do
you
two
know
each
other
mm
cool
he's
a
vampire
i
think
your
friend's
gonna
be
ok
you're
not
my
mother
you
didn't
raise
me
at
all
so
you're
the
first
why
are
you
here
why
now
yeah
well
think
how
pleased
she'll
be
when
i
help
take
you
out
until
it's
time
for
that
i've
got
no
use
for
you
you
don't
know
anything
who
is
it
spike
thank
you
