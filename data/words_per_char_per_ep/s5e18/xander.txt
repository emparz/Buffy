it
we're

whiz
kid
gets
back
from
chem
lab
can
you
have
her

you

bulk
up
the
spell

little
if
you
want
maybe
while

was
the
whole
visionquest

all
we
haven't
seen
any
vamps
are
you
sure
there's
uh

buffy
i
wish
giles
told
us
they
were
back
from
the
desert
i
wish
i
knew
what
went
on
there
whatever
it
was
i
think
she's
still
a
little
spacy
yeah
hey
she
never
asked
about
dawn
something's
wrong
i
hear
something
where's
dawn
good
buffy's
gone
insane
brace
yourself
you're
not
gonna
believe
it
i'm
gonna
go
find
her
and
talk
to
her
if
she's
losing
it
we
gotta
help
her
before
she
gets
herself
hurt
no
but
if
i
have
to
see
her
straddle
spike
again
i
will
definitely
knock
myself
unconscious
i
saw
you

in
the
cemetery
with
buffy
it
is
my
business
because
buffy's
my
friend

and
she's
gone
through
some
stuff
lately
that

well
it's
affected
her
and
you're
taking
advantage
of
her
yes
you
are
a
monster
vampires
are
monsters
they
make
monster
movies
about
them
spike
buffy
has
lost
of
friends
and
we
love
her
very
much
and
we'll
do
whatever
it
takes
to
protect
her
now
if
that
means
killing
you
then
well
that's
just
a
bonus
guys
guys
wake
up
guys

demony
kinds
of
guys
buffy
the
guys
that
work
for
glory
you
said
they're
kind
of
like
hobbits
with
leprosy
well
this
was
a
whole
flock
of
hobbits
and
they
just
grabbed
spike
i
think
they're
taking
him
to
glory
so
how
do
we
find
him
yeah
i
got
nothin'
let's
hit
your
place
we'll
stock
up
if
we're
gonna
stop
spike
from
blabbing
about
dawn
we're
gonna
need
these
yeah
so
we
should
look
okay
buff
it's
okay
you're
right
you
shouldn't
have
to
know
everything
okay
this
has
gone
way
too
far
she
thinks
we're
going
to
rescue
spike
find
him
keep
him
from
talking
whatever
it
takes
then
we're
gonna
have
to
talk
to
her
yeah
'cause
what
we
need
right
now
is
a
sane
buffy
buffy
we
need
to
talk
buffy
we
care
about
you
and
we're
worried
about
you
the
way
you're
acting
the
things
you're
doing
no
one
is
judging
you
it's
understandable
spike
is
strong
and
mysterious
and
sort
of
compact
but
wellmuscled
buffy
i
saw
you
anya
too
we
saw
you
and
spike

with
the
straddling
and
so
say
all
of
us
hey
i
know
this
they're
both
buffy
spike
must
have
had
her
built
so
he
could
program
her
t
already
got
the
visual
we
were
gonna
bring
that
up
it's
not
a
lot
to
go
on
we
dumped
him
back
in
his
crypt
god
i
feel

kind
of
bad
for
the
guy
gets
all
whupped
and
his
best
toy
gets
taken
away
no
no
travesty
completely
on
board
it's
just

the
guy
was
so
thrashed
