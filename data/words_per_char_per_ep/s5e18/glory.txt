he's
getting
stronger
i'm
losing
him
i'm
losing
control
of
him
he
stabbed
you
in
your
body
if
time
runs
out
on
us
and
all
we're
left
with
is
info
then
we're
screwed
no
we're
screwed
i'm
a
god
in
exile
far
from
the
hellfires
of
home
and

sharing
my
body
with
an
enemy
that
stabs
my
boys
in
their
fleshy
little
stomachs
uhh
i'm
in
pain
the
slayer
and
the
key
are
connected
she's
going
to
have
contact
with
it
find
out
who's
new
in
her
life

special
who's
different
watch
her
i
want
to
hear
about
everyone
she
has
contact
with
that
girl
has
my
key

and
i'm
trusting
you
boys
to
get
it
for
me
if
you
love
me

get
it
for
me
what
the
hell
is
that
and
why
is
his
hair
that
color
really
that's
fantabulous
and
impossible
he
can't
be
the
key
because
see
the
key

has
to
be
pure

is
a
vampire
lesson

completely
useless

take
a
peek
at
you
precious
oh
he
doesn't
look
very
fancy
to
me
but
if
the
slayer
protects
him
maybe
appearances
are
deceiving
maybe
there's
something
on
the
inside
shhh

do
you
know
precious
what
can
i
dig
out
of
you
i
have
a
riddle
for
you

is
a
vampire
that
won't
talk

like
an
apple

i
can
do
you
in
one
long
strip

tired
of
these
games

need
time

need
a
drink

a
very
needy
little
bloodsucker
and
it's
not
very
attractive

talkin'
on
the
television

am
a
god
