oh
come
on
i
quite
like
to
cook
helping
you
two
out
makes
me
feel
useful
hmm
how
tempting
how's
she
doing
and
you
i'm
so
sorry
all
i
can
say
is
iit
will
get
better
good
routine's
good
in
fact
i
was
thinking
that
we
might

return
to
our
training
schedule
but
you
were
doing
so
well
stuff
but
you've
mastered
so
much
i
mean
your
strength
and
resilience
alone
buffy
yeah
strength
resilience

those
are
all
words
for
hardness
i'm
starting
to
feel
like

being
the
slayer
is
turning
me
into
stone
turning
you
into
stone
buffy
buffy
just

think
about
it
i
was
never
there
for
riley
not
like
i
was
for
angel
i
was
terrible
to
dawn
at
a
time
like
this
buffy
no
you're
bound
to
feel
emotionally
numb
oh
she
knew
always
buffy
well
i
shouldn't
wonder
how
serious
are
you
about
this
there
is
something

in
the
watchers'
diaries

a
quest
not
a
grail
maybe
answers
it
would
take
a
day
perhaps
two
some
slayers
before
buffy
found
it
helpful
in

regaining
their
focus
learning
more
about
their
role
there's
a
sacred
place
in
the
desert
it's
it's
not
far
supplies
what
about
a
book
a
gourd
and
a
bunch
of
twigs
they're
for
me
come
on
this
way
you
see
the
location
of
the
sacred
place
is
a
guarded
secret
i
can't
take
you
there
myself
i'll
have
to
perform
a
ritual
to

transfer
my
guardianship
of
you
temporarily
to
to
a
guide
this'll
do
buffy
please
it
takes
more
than
a
week
to
bleach
bones
i
uh
jump
out
of
the
circle
and
then
jump
back
in
it
and
then
um

i
shake
my
gourd
go
quest
quite
extraordinary
really
guyles
spike
didn't
even
bother
to
program
my
name
properly
buffy
we're
here
buffy
tried
to
find
out
if
he'd

told
her
anything
but
he
was
too
badly
beaten
to
make
much
sense
but
uh
not
to
worry
you
know
i'm
sure
we'll
all
be
perfectly
safe
