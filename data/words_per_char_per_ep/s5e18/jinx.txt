you're
speaking
of
ben
most
glamorous
yet
tasteful
one
oh
surely
not
how
can
we
help
we'll
lay
down
our
lives
gentlemen
i'm
so
sorry
to
intrude
but
i
wondered
if
i
might
beg
a
moment
of
your
time
tie
his
hands
glory
will
want
him
restrained
careful
with
him
she
will
want
the
key
intact
but
your
holiness
we
observed
the
slayer
she
protected
this
one
above
all
others
she
treated
him
as
precious
oh
bob
barker
the
slayer
was
there
she
seemed
to
be
everywhere
at
once
they
may
have
been
demons
