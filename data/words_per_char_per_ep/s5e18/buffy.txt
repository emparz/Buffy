giles
you
don't
have
to
help
you
cooked
dawn
if
there
are
any
plates
in
your
room
let's
have
them
before
they
get
furry
and
we
have
to
name
them
i'm
okay
well
some
minutes
are
harder
than
others
it
has
to
we're
holding
up
though
you
know
getting
into
a
routine
i
don't
know
i
was
um
thinking
about

maybe

taking
a
break
or
something
just
ease
off
for
a
while
not
get
into
full
slay
mode
aand
you
were
great
helping
me
with
everything
i'm
just

starting
to
feel

uneasy
about
stuff
training
slaying
all
of
it
it's
just

i
mean

i
can
beat
up
the
demons
until
the
cows
come
home
and
then
i
can
beat
up
the
cows

but
i'm
not
sure
i
like
what
it's
doing
to
me
yeah
strength
resilience

those
are
all
words
for
hardness
i'm
starting
to
feel
like

being
the
slayer
is
turning
me
into
stone
just

think
about
it
i
was
never
there
for
riley
not
like
i
was
for
angel
i
was
terrible
to
dawn
no
before
that
riley
left
because
i
was
shut
down
he's
gone
and
now
my
mom
is
gone

and
i
loved
her
more
than
anything

and

i
don't
know
if
she
knew
i
don't
know
to
slay
to
kill

iit
means
being
hard
on
the
inside
maybe
being
the
perfect
slayer
means
being
too
hard
to
love
at
all
i
already
feel
like
i
can
hardly
say
the
words
giles

i
love
you
love

love
love
love
love
giles
it
feels
strange
ten
i'm
serious
to
the
amount
of
ten
a
quest
like
finding
a
grail
or
something
i'm
not
leaving
dawn
not
with
glory
looking
for
her
but
i
can't
go
i'm
not
leaving
you
dawn
i
love
you
dawn
you
know
that
right
i
love
you

really
love
you
sorry
but
it's
important
that
i
tell
you
weird
love's
better
than
no
love
what's
in
the
trunk
supplies
i
was
wondering
about
that
like
food
water
maybe
a
compass
i
don't
think
i'll
be
that
hungry
a
guide
but
no
food
or
water
so
it
leads
me
to
the
sacred
place
and
then
a
week
later
it
leads
you
to
my
bleached
bones
so
how's
it
start
i
know
this
ritual
the
ancient
shamans
were
next
called
upon
to
do
the
hokeypokey
and
turn
themselves
around
and
that's
what
it's
all
about
hello
kitty

know
this
place
