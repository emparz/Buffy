so
you
had
trouble
getting
past
kathy
and
you
thought
your
days
of
sneaking
out
of
your
room
were
over
i'm
chewing
my
gum
kinda
loud
my
sneakers
are
squeaky
oh
sorry
no
oh
kathy's
still
spinnin'
the
divas
yeah
i
mean
this
whole
dorm
thing
is
just
an
adjustment
we
need
to
make
you
know
i
mean
my
roomie
is
kind
of
challenging
too
exactly
i
mean
did
we
not
put
the
'grr'
in
girl
well
here's
where
i
get
off
happy
hunting
and
eat
off
my
plate
so
spill
what
was
that
all
about
with
the
cutie
patootie
it
looked
like
more
than
that
to
me
he
got
all
googlyeyed
hi
bear
i'm
sure
it's
not
easy
for
her
she's
not
like
you
she
doesn't
know
anybody
here
yeah
i
guess
it's
hard
uh
but
i'm
sure
the
sweater
thing
was
an
accident
me
too
i
would
vote
for
that
too
he's
our
grownup
friend
nnot
in
a
creepy
way
so
we
need
to
figure
out
if
this
ritual
their
dreaming
about
has
some
special
use
or
meaning
ok
so
that
was
the
evil
twin
right
'cause
she
was
bordering
on
cordeliaesque
aand
she
hasn't
been
sleeping
yeah
both
of
them
i
mean
what
kind
of
demon
runs
around
putting
ookie
blood
dreams
into
people's
heads
like
some
kind
of
nightmare
fairy
it's
not
right
and
buffy's
completely
being
not
herself
if
it
wasn't
for
this
english
paper
i'd
be
there
right
now
um
listening
doing
the
girly
best
friend
thing
you
can
you're
the
best
oh
she's
probably
patrolling
by
now
check
around
the
science
center
if
you
need
me
i'll
be
at
the
library
iit
sounds
like
things
are
rough
but
don't
you
want
to
be
talking
to
buffy
about
this
well
normal
is
relative
right
buffy
come
on
we
were
only
just
saying
hi
buffy
this
has
to
stop
i
mean
ii
get
it
i
have
a
sucky
roomie
too
but
you
just
have
to
deal
good
that's
better
you
have
to
kill
her
don't
you
think
you
could
just
switch
rooms
or
something
toenails
good
thinking
'cause
in
the
middle
of
the
night
those
toenails
could
have
attacked
you
and
left
little
halfmoon
marks
all
over
your
body
of
course
iit
makes
sense
now
but
you
better
show
those
bad
puppies
to
giles
before
you
do
anything
just
to
be
sure
uh
you
hurry
on
to
giles
i'll
hang
here
andand
keep
an
eye
on
kathy
giles
ii
just
talked
to
buffy
and
yeah
i
think
she's
feeling
a
little
insane
no
nnot
bitchy
crazy
more
like
homicidal
maniac
crazy
so
i
told
her
to
come
to
you
kay
can
i
come
in
i
don't
know
exactly
but
i've
been
thinking
it
might
be
a
good
idea
for
you
and
buffy
to
give
each
other
some
apart
time
in
fact
you
might
want
to
be
uh
apart
before
she
gets
back
iit's
not
fair
i
know
i
don't
know
about
that
uh
buffy's
going
through
something
yes
but
herself
hi
you
did
she's
at
giles
uh
ok
you
know
during
that
really
short
phone
call
i
realized
you
are
so
right
i
mean
it's
not
fair
to
make
you
leave
your
own
room
so
you're
good
you
just
stay
right
there
kay
guys
i
just
saw
kathy
and
she's
acting
oh
my
god
are
you
ok
ii'll
call
kathy
tell
her
to
get
out
of
there
no
answer
and
that's
a
demon
thing
so
buffy
was
right
all
along
later
on
big
remorse
how's
that
about
thatthe
kathy
thingi'm
sorry
i
doubted
you
that's
a
pretty
big
'except'
you
going
to
finish
this
