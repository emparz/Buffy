i
was
just
lucky
i
was
just
being
modest
with
the
whole
'lucky'
thing
you
got
that
right
so
then
professor
walsh
said
that
i
was
just
as
amazing
as
riley
had
said
and
later
he
told
me
that
she
couldn't
stop
talking
about
this
move
i
made
where
i
used
one
of
the
commandos
as
a
shield
to
block
a
taser
blast
it
was
like
twelvethousand
volts
it
took
the
guy
almost
two
hours
to
recover
hmm
how
was
your
night
bronze
the
gang
are
you
kidding
i
wouldn't
be
anywhere
else
i
miss
you
guys
we
haven't
been
able
to
spend
that
much
time
together
lately
riley
just
walked
in
willow
looks
over
her
shoulder
and
we
see
riley
at
the
lunch
counter
perusing
the
fruit
bowl
no
just
enjoying
a
good
stare
tell
me
about
your
night
that
sounds
like
fun
will
i
think
you
better
get
used
to
a
twinkie
that's
his
lunch
oh
he
is
so
gonna
be
punished
what
i
know
i'm
ready
i
want
to
my
god
you
said
it
was
big
you
told
me
but
you
never
said
it
was
huuuge
i
had
no
idea
this
is
incredible
but
not
that
i
thought
it
was
some
flybynight
operation
unless
it
is
i
mean
can
you
guys
fly
at
night
with
those
jetpack
things
do
you
have
those
this
is
unreal
yeah
yes
it's
very



clean
oh
and
i
thought
i
was
never
gonna
get
homework
from
you
again
and
what
do
you
call
those
behavior
modification
so
i've
seen



on
the
discovery
channel
with
gorillas
and
sharks
theythey
made
them
all
nice
you
haven't
seen
it
what's
over
there
what
is
it
what's
in
there
quick
shot
of
the
metal
security
door
we
saw
in
the
last
episode
a
lab
coat
scientist
uses
a
id
card
to
open
the
door
and
disappears
inside
been
thinking
about
getting
one
of
these
right
hi
all
sorry
about
the
lateitude
coke
please
anya
seems
a
bit
on
edge
oh
you
know
i
didn't
think
that
you
would
mind
riley
and
the
guys
were
throwing
a
little
impromptu
celebration
in
my
honor
and
made
it
like
impossible
to
not
invite
them
i'm
sorry
i
had
no
idea
my
total
bad
so
who
did
you
want
to
invite
you
said
you
wanted
to
invite
someone
i'm
in
the
initiative
professor
walsh
gave
me
the
grand
tour
and
we're
talking
grand
as
in
canyon
you'd
never
believe
the
size
of
it
no
nnot
exactly
it
just
means
that
when
i
patrol
i'll
have
a
heavily
armed
team
backing
me
up
plus
boyfriend
going
to
work
with
me

big
extra
perk
i
thought
you
liked
riley
i
know
that
like
what
does
walmart
have
bagboys
well
a
man
that
worships
chaos
and
tries
to
kill
you
is
a
man
you
can
trust
will



so
what's
the
big
emergency
question
why
exactly
can't
we
damage
this
polka
thing's
arms
i
uh
not
that
i
want
to
it's
just
in
my
experience
when
fighting
for
your
life
body
parts
get
damaged
and
better
its
bits
than
mine
or



ours
what
do
they
want
why
are
they
here
sacrifices
treasure
or
they
just
get
rampagy
i
find
it's
easier
to
predict
their
responses
if
i
know
oh
you
mean
the
cammo
and
stuff
i
thought
about
it
but
i
mean
it's
gonna
look
all
'private
benjamin'
don't
worry
i've
patrolled
in
this
halter
many
times
so
i
guess
she
hates
me
now
professor
walsh
questions
an
initiative
faux
pas
yes
really
maybe
i
should
get
her
a
present
or
something
right
right
what
do
you
mean
she
liked
me
before
you
did
you
didn't
like
me
riley
so



what
do
you
want
to
do
now
before
he
says
anything
cut
to
riley's
room
which
becomes
now
and
riley
is
on
top
again
as
they
continue
to
make
love
the
music
is
replaced
by
a
more
sinister
theme
as
we
cut
to
a
black
and
white
ceilingshot
of
riley's
room
the
camera
pulls
back
and
we
see
we're
looking
into
a
surveillance
monitor
there
is
a
label
on
top
of
the
monitor
that
has
'finn'
written
on
it
as
the
shot
continues
to
pull
back
we
see
two
more
monitors
to
either
side
of
it
with
similar
shots
of
currently
empty
rooms
one
is
labeled
'gates'
the
other
'miller'
a
control
panel
becomes
visible
under
the
row
of
monitors
there
are
two
reels
of
tape
spinning
obviously
in
'record'
mode
and
there
is
someone
sitting
in
front
of
the
control
panel
i
never
know
what
to
expect
your
robot
bird
sounds
hungry
you're
kidding

the
regimental
soldier

approaching
the
table
where

still
sleeping

a
sheet
covering
him

more
of
his
mismatched
demon
body

wearing
commando
pants
and
boots
there
is
a
strange
metalelectronic
plate
on
his
chest
where
the
heart
would
be
