you
know
magic
at
the
poker
table
qualifies
as
cheating
let's
see
the
ace
chips
they're
called
chips
they
represent
money
since
none
of
us
has
any
money
it
represents
money
but
that's
gonna
change
once
my
merchandise
hits
the
street
not
drugs
you
are
looking
at
the
new
local
distributor
for
boost
bars
'the
natural
food
bar
that
provides
a
nutritional
energy
boost
for
active
healthconscience
people'
want
one
well
don't
let
the
healthy
scare
you
check
out
these
ingredients
see
loaded
with
fatty
goodness
wish
the
buff
could've
made
it
this
threehand
poker
is
not
quite
the
game
well


the
thing
is



i
think
riley
is



okay
in
an
oafish
kind
of
way
but



am
i
the
only
one
with
a
big
floating
question
mark
over
his
head
about
this
initiative
thing
and
why
not
there's
still
heaps
we
don't
know
about
these
commandos
what
exactly
are
they
up
to
well
let
me
put
it
in
a
way
you'll
understand
sell
bars
make
money
take
anya
nice
places
buy
pretty
things
oh
well
this
was
the
only
one
i
had
on
me
besides
it's
getting
late
maybe
we
should
go
let's
face
it
will
she's
over
an
hour
late
she's
probably
out
living
the
life
of
riley
i
don't
think
she's
coming
late
really
huh
hadn't
noticed
no
we
are
w
try
one
check
these
flavors
cherryberry
maple
walnut
ooo
almond
licorice
anya
we
don't
say
'ew'
in
front
of
potential
customers
an
excellent
choice
it's
the
uh
the
gritty
texture
isn't
it
maybe
you're
more
a
cherryberry
fellow
spike
you
may
want
to
give
up
these
morning
jogs
spike
said
that



that
hurts
we
don't
have
any
that
blinking
thing
my
pseudosoldier
memory
bank
tells
me
that's
a
tracer
it's
like
a
homing
beacon
and
if
commando
guys
are
reading
the
signal
they're
coming
home
so
how
is
this
supposed
to
work
again
giles
sure
just
explain
to
the
nice
scientist
guys
that
you
really
miss
killing
and
torturing
innocent
people
