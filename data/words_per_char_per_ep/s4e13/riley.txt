alpha
team

me
what
it's



a
little
unusual
she's
just
not
used

it
maybe
because
you
barely
ever
opened
your
mouth
in
her
classroom
but
i
know
she
likes
you
in
fact
she
liked
you
before
i
did
told
me
so
herself
buffy

we
talk
about
this
later
there's
a
dangerous
hostile
out
here

don't
have
your
reflexes

kinda
need
to
focus
uh

hear
graham's
garbled
voice

make
out
any
of
the
words
say
again
beta

breaking
up

how
they
trained
me
you
know
the
government
plucked
me
out
of
special
op
training
for
this
they
didn't
in
the
military

to
follow
orders
not
ask
questions
hm
i
know
all
i
need
to
know
we're
doing
good
here

the
public

the
subterrestrial
threat
