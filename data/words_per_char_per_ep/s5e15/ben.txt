buffy
well
actually
these
are
orthopedic
pants
man
that
sounded
so
funny
in
my
head
you
having
a
good
time
i
am
now
i'm
not
really
good
you
know
rhythm
uh
sure
i'd
love
to
let
me
just
dump
this
i'll
be
right
back
was
that
guy
bothering
you
should
i
um
offer
to
get
inappropriately
violent
or
something
good
'cause
honestly
i
don't
wanna
um
first
uh
yeah
my
phone
number
i
was
gonna
try
to
subtly
work
it
into
the
conversation
but
it
didn't
pan
out
and
i
thought
i
should
try
to
give
it
to
you
before
you
see
me
dance
you
know
in
case
you
wanna
get
coffee
apparently
we'd
be
risking
a
tragic
chain
reaction
but

i
just
really
like

coffee
i
think
coffee
might
be
worth
it
and
i
would
like
to
get
to
know

coffee
better
hello
no
i
just

i
just
got
in
is
all
night
shift
at
the
hospital
i'm
glad
you
called
yeah
yes
coffee
would
be
great

tomorrow
night
sure
bye
