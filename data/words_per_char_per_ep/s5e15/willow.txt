a
good
deed
i
thought
you
were
getting
the
crunchies
there's
something
strange
about
her
she
talks
funny
definitely
not
oh
not
me
i
i
was
just
saying
a
pretty
girl
like
that
there's
always
someone
lurking
around
looking
for
some
action
okay
it's
an
unusual
name
there's
hardly
any
except

warren
beatty
and
you
know
president
harding
itit's
probably
not
either
of
them
given
enough
time
i
can
get
a
list
of
the
sunnydale
students
named
warren
tonight
but

then
we'll
have
to
call
them
or
go
to
their
dorms
so
we
probably
can't
start
narrowing
it
down
till
tomorrow
i
agree
i'm
not
sure
this
is
a
code
red
hey
is
there
a
code
pink
we
need
more
codes
and
got
nothin'
i
found
one
warren
but
he
moved
out
of
the
country
a
year
ago
i'm
checking
nearby
schools
hey
i
think
i
found
him
a
warren
mears
he
went
to
sunnydale
high
with
us
for
a
semester
and
then
he
went
to
the
tech
college
over
in
dutton
i've
got
a
local
address
where
his
folks
still
live
yeah

she's
just
sort
of
a
maybe
he
couldn't
find
a
real
person
i'm
not
i'm
just
saying
people
get
lonely
and
maybe
having
someone
around
even
someone
you
made
up

maybe
it's
easier
nope
whole
new
robot
this
one
was
a
girl
yeah
and
by
the
way
we're
working
on
a
way
to
deinvite
you
from
here
even
if
it
is
a
public
place
