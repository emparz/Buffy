april
her
voice
gets
deeper
like
a
tape
running
too
slow
she
stops
frozen
with
a
small
smile
on
her
face
her
eyes
stay
open
buffy
looks
at
her
with
a
frown
then
looks
down
pensively
the
camera
pulls
up
and
out
to
a
wide
aerial
shot
as
buffy
turns
away
then
turns
back
still
sitting
on
the
swing
next
to
april
we
see
buffy
sitting
nearby
watching
xander
smiles
buffy
pauses
looks
thoughtful
xander
skeptical
buffy
she
looks
down
as
xander
continues
working
buffy
smiles
xander
turns
back
to
the
window
again
buffy
picks
up
the
piece
of
paper
with
ben's
phone
number
on
it
looks
at
it
bites
her
lip
buffy
on
machine
pan
up
to
glory
wearing
a
sparkly
gold
dress
with
her
arms
crossed
over
her
chest
listening
we
see
jinx
behind
her
glory
confused
glory
shakes
her
head
firmly
jinx
shrugs
glory
frowns
looks
from
him
to
the
answering
machine
and
back
again
glory
pouting
he
sighs
goes
to
hang
up
the
phone
turns
around
and
gasps
in
shock
as
he
sees
spike
standing
behind
him
holding
the
box
full
of
buffy
shrine
stuff
spike
walks
closer
spike
shoves
the
box
into
warren's
hands
shot
of
the
box
full
of
buffy
photos
and
the
buffy
wig
warren
stares
at
spike
spike
smiles
buffy
calling
she
turns
sees
some
flowers
on
the
table
beside
the
door
she
opens
the
card
that
came
with
the
flowers
shot
of
the
card
which
reads

buffy
to
herself
she
turns
to
call
up
the
stairs
putting
down
her
jacket
buffy
calls
in
the
background
on
the
living
room
sofa
we
can
see
someone
or
something
but
it's
out
of
focus
the
focus
is
on
buffy
in
the
foreground
buffy
frowns
looks
down
the
hall
toward
the
kitchen
she
turns
and
looks
in
the
living
room
she
walks
into
the
living
room
stops
shot
of
joyce
lying
on
the
sofa
her
eyes
are
open
staring
sightlessly
at
the
ceiling
one
arm
hangs
loosely
over
the
edge
of
the
sofa
she
does
not
move
or
blink
buffy
quieter
buffy
even
quieter
buffy
very
quietly
blackout
