what
is
a
cat
scan
exactly
where
do
they
get
the
cat
scan
from
i
mean

they
test
it
on
cats
or

or
does
the
machine
sort
of
look
like
a
cat
oh

i'm
not
hungry

i
just

this
is
better
i
had
my
tenth
birthday
party
here
mmhmm
we'd
just
moved
to
sunnydale
and

mom
rented
the
carousel
for
an
entire
hour
for
just
me
and
my
friends
except
i
hadn't
made
any
friends
yet
so

it
was
just
me
and
mom
and
buffy
riding
it
by
ourselves
over
and
over
and
over
again
for
the
whole
hour
just
so
mom
felt
like
we'd
gotten
our
money's
worth
she's

she's
not
gonna
get
better
is
she
i'm
really
glad
you're
here
buffy's
glad
too
she
sure
cries
a
lot
less
with
you
than
she
did
with
angel
everything
with
him
was
all

eee
you
know
you
know

my
boyfriend's
a
vampire
crazy
crazy
every
day
was
like
the
end
of
the
world

doesn't
get
all
worked
up
like
that
over
you

been
really
good
for
her

she
awake
yet

we
take
her
home
now
