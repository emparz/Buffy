i
wouldn't
call
it
rude
oh
nice
tomb
go
boom
it'd
be
nice
if
we
knew
where
she
was
where
she's
hiding
out
it
feels
like
we're
going
around
in
circles
what
do
you
mean
giles
the
dagon
sphere
you
said
that
was
created
to
repel
so
i'm
thinking
maybe
she
oh
i
do
it
was
an
ancient
egyptian
cult
heavy
into
dark
magic
young
woman
we
can
look

i
mean
we
will
but

i
haven't
seen
anything
it's
no
biggie
sheshe
just
got
an
amulet
and
a
bloodstone
okay
biggie
transmogrifying
is
changing
a
living
thing
into
a
different
kind
of
thing
but
you
buffy
but
what
will
i
can't
just
sit
here
i
have
to
do
something
tara
and
i
did
a
minipatrol
earlier
but
biggie
snake
was
nowhere
to
be
suddenly
the
snake
creature
bursts
in
through
the
display
window
everyone
turns
as
it
slithers
inside
and
rears
up
looking
at
them
dawn
is
in
the
forefront
the
snake
smacks
a
display
case
with
one
arm
and
it
topples
over
onto
buffy
knocking
her
to
the
floor
the
snake
moves
toward
dawn
who
screams
continuously
as
it
looms
over
her
its
eyes
glow
red
again
dawn
continues
screaming
as
buffy
struggles
to
get
out
from
under
the
case
and
the
snake
stares
at
dawn
then
it
turns
and
slithers
quickly
back
out
the
way
it
came
in
blackout
why
was
the
big
snake
afraid
of
dawn
