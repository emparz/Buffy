and
plus
riley
he
seems
like
he
wouldn't
tell
a
little
white
lie
let
alone
a
whole
bunch
of
big
dirty
ones
we
could
go
to
my
place
oh
plus
mirror
ball
well
no
buff
that's
why
they
call
them
cartoons
not
documentaries
well
look
who's
cranky
bear
in
the
morning
it'll
be
okay
buffy
riley's
just
confused
that's
all
poor
buffy
your
life
resists
all
things
average
buffy
it's
not
your
fault
how
could
you
know
howdy
i
had
so
much
fun
the
other
night
the
spells
i
hope
you
don't
think
that
i
just
come
over
for
the
spells
and
everything
i
mean
i
really
like
just
talking
and
hanging
out
with
you
and
stuff

only
because
it's
really
important
there's
this
you

one
should
be
fun
too
we
conjure
the
goddess
thespia
to
help
us
locate
demonic
energy
in
the
area
it
shouldn't
be
too
tricky
you
and
me
this
is
beneath
us
right
it's
like
a
map
we
both
take
different
parts
of
the
potion
and
when
we
do
the
incantation
we
both
blow
it
onto
the
square
at
the
exact
same
time
well
that's
the
cool
part
when
the
potion
mixes
and
thespia's
called
it
creates
this
mist
over
the
parts
where
the
demons
are
iit
even
makes
different
colors
for
different
breeds
you
ready
let's
do
it
thespia
goddess
ruler
of
all
darkness
we
implore
you



open
a
window
to
the
world
of
the
underbeing
with
your
knowledge
may
we
go
in
safety
with
your
grace
may
we
speak
of
your
benevolence
or
not
