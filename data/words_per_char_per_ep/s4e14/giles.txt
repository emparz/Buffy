probably
not
but
uh



we'd
be
remiss
if
we
didn't
think
of
all
the
possibilities
what
could
have
happened
to
make
professor
walsh
want
to
kill
you
clearly
although
one
can
only
imagine
what
she'd
be
so
desperate
to
hide
buffy
i
think
perhaps
we
should
talk
about
this
absolutely
not
i
will
not
squat
in
that
dank
whole
precisely
besides
i
don't
see
why
we
can't
stay
right
where
we
are
because
it's
very
unlikely
those
initiative
boys
are
gonna
come
around
here
looking
for
the
front
door
opens
and
riley
steps
inside
we
think
buffy
may
have
been
becoming
too
in
inquisitive
that
she
was
getting
close
to
something
that
professor
walsh
was
trying
to
hide
any
idea
what
that
might
be
see
i've
heard
rumors
that
the
initiative
wasn't
all
that
we've
been
told
that
uh
secretly
they're
working
towards
some
darker
purpose
something
that
might
harm
us
all
must
we
have
the
noise
my
head
is
splitting
yes
i
can't
imagine
why
i
didn't
sleep
well
in
my
beach
ball
really
i'm
surprised
you
could
hear
it
over
your
wagnerian
snoring
sorry
she
must
have
sent
it
after
you
she's
right
you
mustn't
blame
yourself
how
is
he
it's
a
minor
point
but
how
do
you
plan
to
get
in
to
the
initiative
i'm
sure
their
security
system's
almost
impenetrable
okay
well
as
for
the
whereabouts
of
this
polgara
demon
i'm
afraid
we've


we've
not
turned
up
much
there've
been
no
reports
since
its
original
capture
if
it's
any
consolation
we
haven't
fared
much
better
here
well
hhe's
asleep
finally
but
he
doesn't
look
good
and
the
uh
research
is
troubling
as
well
i
mean
thisthis
demon
we're
after
seems
highly
atypical
for
a
polgara
this
child
that
it
killed


was
mutilated
there's
no
recorded
cases
of
a
polgara
ever
having
done
such
a
thing
exactly
you're
not
well
riley
yyou
need
to
rest
well
no
we're
still
looking
but
hey
you
all
right
