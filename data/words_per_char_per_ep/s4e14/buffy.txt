so
maggie
sends
me
down
into
the
sewers
with
one
of
those
blastoguns
and
the
next
thing
i
know
it's
raining
monsters
and
then
this
gate
slams
down
behind
me
and
i
try
to
use
the
gun
but
it
goes
phitt
giles
you're
saying
that
maggie
walsh
set
you
up
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying
she
sent
me
on
a
wayone
recon
what
does
my
taste
in
men
have
to
do
with
this
you
guys
think
riley
had
something
to
do
with
this
right
remiss
no
no
maggie
made
sure
he
was
no
where
around
when
she
sent
me
on
this
very
special
make
buffy
dead
assignment
all
i
know
is
that
maggie
has
it
in
for
me
which
means
the
initiative
has
it
in
for
me
which
brings
us
back
to
the
not
safe
for
any
of
us
concept
i
don't
know
uh



she
wasn't
keen
on
the
fact
that
i
was
asking
a
lot
of
questions
that's
for
sure
okay
everybody
grab
a
weapon
we
gotta
move
i
was
thinking
more
that
we'd
hide
we
need
to
relocate
some
place
where
we're
less
likely
to
be
found
we
need
to
come
up
with
a
plan
the
initiative
guys
know
how
close
we
are
they'll
automatically
check
the
places
you
hang
out
xander
what
about
your
basement
the
guys
haven't
seen
us
together
that
much
and
there's
enough
room
you
know
maggie
tried
to
kill
me
what
this
is
spike
he's
uh



it's
a
really
long
story
but
he's
not
bad
anymore
it's
not
like
that
what
about
314
maybe
that's
it
then
why
did
she
tell
you
i
was
dead
riley
it
wasn't
a
test
riley
look
no
one
is
sure
of
anything
okay
we're
just
trying
to
sort
it
out
riley
that
would
never
happen
okay
you
guys
could
we
not
please
everything's
screwed
up
enough
without
you
two
doing
scenes
from
my
parents'
marriage
thank
you
i
don't
know
it
just
seems
like
things
can
get
heavier
his
whole
world's
falling
apart
that
was
the
idea
riley
was
supposed
to
be
mr
joe
guy
we
were
gonna
do
dumb
things
like
hold
hands
through
the
daisies
going
tra
la
la
i'll
try
and
remember
that
it's
too
late
anyway
i'm
already
at
the
i
hurt
when
he
hurts
i
smile
when
he
smiles
stage
i'll
just
have
to
make
it
work
the
polgara
demon
had
a
skewer
in
its
arm
that's
the
one
maggie
insisted
we
bring
back
alive
and
it
got
distracted
god
i'm
not
going
to
i'm
going
to
the
crime
scene
to
see
what
i
can
find
out
you
guys
research
the
polgara
demon
i
want
to
know
where
it
is
when
i
find
it
i
am
going
to
make
him
pay
for
taking
that
kid's
life
i'll
make
him
die
in
ways
he
can't
even
imagine
that
probably
would
have
sounded
more
commanding
if
i
wasn't
wearing
my
yummy
sushi
pajamas
hey
look
i'm
sorry
about
earlier
i
know
everyone
came
on
pretty
strong
and
the
spike
thing
isn't
as
tweaked
as
it
looked
okay
maybe
it
is
but
there's
an
explanation
that
almost
makes
sense
hello
i'm
apologizing
here
and
i
think
that's
pretty
big
of
me
considering
i'm
the
one
who
was
almost
made
a
demon
sandwich
this
is
the
part
where
you
throw
me
a
bone
how
can
you
ask
me
that
of
course
i'm
not
happy
what
happened
classifi
the
polgara
it
got
her
and
escaped
didn't
it
i'm
gonna
find
it
i'm
gonna
find
it
and
destroy
it
and
then
you
can
stop
asking
me
how
happy
all
this
death
makes
me
oh
i
missed
you
too
the
joint's
jumping
you
mean
as
a
doubledealing
snitch
that's
swell
really
but
i
need
to
know
if
you've
heard
anything
about
a
polgara
demon
doing
some
killings
in
the
last
few
of
days
i'm
gonna
have
to
punch
you
aren't
i
not
yet
i
haven't
touched
you
what
have
you
heard
about
the
polgara
and
that
was
the
last
you
heard
what
about
those
army
guys
what
do
you
know
you
heard
anything
about
314
what
are
you
doing
here
following
me
oh

smooth
officer
riley
they
teach
you
those
undercover
moves
in
special
forces
leave
him
alone
riley
he's
human
you're
shaking
you
have
the
truth
you
are
just
too
screwed
up
because
of
what
happened
to
professor
walsh
to
see
it
now
let
go
of
me
riley
riley


riley
why

be
more
comfortable

hurting
yourself

you're
gonna
be
okay
this
isn't
just
grief
making
him
act
this
way
something's
effecting
him
physically
and
it's
getting
worse
i
don't
know
but
i'm
ready
to
find
out
she
must
have
kept
records
somewhere
aabout
riley
about
314
about
all
of
it
and
i'm
sure
she
wasn't
the
only
person
that
knew
what
she
was
up
to
giles
anya
keep
researching
xander
you
and
i
are
going
undercover
he's
the
only
one
with
military
experience
i
have
my
clearance
i'm
hoping
she
didn't
have
time
to
revoke
it
then
we'll
just
have
to
keep
looking
it
usually
is
this
time
of
shh
sorry
i'm
the
only
one
that
can
pass
the
retinal
scan
retinal
scan
xander
well
we'll
know
in
a
few
seconds
if
my
clearance
is
still
good
i
know
what
what
are
you
talking
about
please
could
you
possibly
draw
more
attention
to
us
this
is
the
initiative
xander
military
guys
and
scientists
do
not
make
out
with
each
other
now
i
don't
generally
like
to
kill
humans
but
i've
learned
that
it
pays
to
be
flexible
in
life
oh
darn
so
this
isn't
a
surprise
now
you
can
tell
me
what
you
did
to
riley
and
after
that
we
can
take
a
tour
of
room
314
what
i
didn't
do
that
riley
he
can
tell
us
what
we
need
to
know
maggie
wanted
me
dead
didn't
she
why
spell
it
out
for
me
i
feel
an
attack
of
dumb
blonde
coming
on
well
think
harder
project
314
angleman
said
walsh
was
feeding
you
drugs
look
if
you
will
just
listen
to
me
okay
i
am
trying
to
help
you
get
to
the
truth
stop
it
i
didn't
do
anything
riley
stop
this
isn't
about
us
everything
that
we
need
to
know
is
here
we
just
need
to
find
out
what
was
in
314
she
pieced
you
together
from
parts
of
other
demons
riley
are
you
okay
it's
not
the
polgara
it
looks
sort
of
half
man
he
needs
to
go
to
a
hospital
i'm
going
with
him
no
nothing
the
initiative
probably
has
him
locked
in
some
medical
ward
there's
no
way
i
can
get
near
him
until
i
come
up
with
a
better
plan
than
just
storming
in
and
getting
us
all
shot
what
am
i
going
to
do
he
needs
me
and
i
can't
get
near
him
it's
not
like
i
can
spend
all
of
my
energy
going
after
the
initiative
not
while
adam's
out
there
i
could
barely
fight
him
iit
was
like
maggie
designed
him
to
be
the
ultimate
warrior
he's
smart
and
fast
he
gave
the
commando
guys
the
slip
with
no
problem
i
think
the
part
where
he's
pure
evil
and
kills
randomly
was
an
oversight
i
never
should
have
let
them
take
riley
i
need
to
be
with
him
there's
no
way
he
can
be
everything
he's
ever
believed
in
has
been
taken
away
or



he's
alone
he
has
nothing
to
hold
on
to
cut
to
the
corridors
of
the
initiative
commandos
and
scientists
are
going
about
business
as
usual
one
commando
is
standing
guard
at
a
closed
door
dissolve
to
interior
and
the
camera
pans
across
the
medical
room
where
we
see
riley
lying
on
a
bed
his
abdomen
is
wrapped
heavily
in
bandages
a
small
red
stain
over
his
wound
he's
still
sweating
a
little
but
no
longer
seems
agitated
he's
staring
at
the
wall
