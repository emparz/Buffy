dr
walsh
adam
stand
back
show
some
respect
listen
everybody's
upset
but
arguing
isn't
going
to
help
anything
and
it's
certainly
not
what
professor
walsh
would
want
all
right
good
now
washington
is
sending
in
a
team
to
do
an
internal
investigation
i've
been
told
we
have
to
wait
for
their
word
probably
looks
like
last
night
the
polgara
escaped
through
tunnel
seventytwo
i'm
afraid
so
my
orders
from
washington
are
for
a
total
lockdown
until
they
arrive
i'm
sorry
now
return
to
your
quarters
there's
nothing
you
can
do
here
how
many
of
the
men
are
still
out
the
longer
they
go
without
their
meds



it's
dangerous
i
don't
want
to
think
about
the
damage
our
guys
could
do
under
the
stress
of
withdrawal
especially
since
they
won't
understand
what's
happening
to
them
these
guys
don't
know
they've
been
getting
meds
in
their
food
so
we
better
get
them
in
here
stat
but
finn
wasn't
one
of
them
right
find
him
he's
the
one
i
care
about
he's
too
important
to
the
work
to
lose
now
keep
me
posted
i'll
be
in
records
he
walks
away
and
the
other
scientist
heads
in
the
other
direction
i
was
wondering
when
you'd
turn
up
somebody's
coming
you
know
i'm
sure
they've
already
seen
you
on
the
security
monitors
finn
take
this
girl
to
the
stockade
immediately
she
did
but
understand
the
initiative
has
no
interest
in
eliminating
the
slayer
it
was
her
own
vendetta
i
don't
know
it
was



the
project
it



it
escaped
she
was
iit's
not
riley
all
she
was
doing
was
trying
to
help
people



and
this
is
the
way
you
want
them
to
remember
her
adam
maggie
would
want
you
to
stand
down
