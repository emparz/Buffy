don't
you
hate
her
i
think
it's
contagious
the
whole
senior
class
has
turned
into
the
sixties
or
what
i
would
have
imagined
the
sixties
would
have
been
like
without
the
war
and
the
hairy
armpits
no
i
don't
i
guess
i'll
miss
stuff
but
i
just
don't
get
the
whole
graduation
thing
i
mean
you
get
a
piece
of
paper
and
nothing
changes
i
don't
even
think
i'm
gonna
go
ascension
mayor
becoming
a
demon
snacking
up
on
populace
i
was
planning
on
fighting
him
go
to
graduation
and
fight
the
mayor
hear
what
i
don't
believe
this
the
mayor
at
graduation
a
hundred
helpless
kids
to
feed
on
got
any
other
surprises
for
us
faith
one
of
her
pieces
i
recognize
the
brush
work
doesn't
read
i
think
it's
homework
which
leads
to
the
question
how
come
i'm
gonna
destroy
the
entire
city
but
i
take
the
time
to
kill
harmless
lester
first
then
i
wanna
know
too
the
mayor's
trying
to
hide
i
say
we
go
seek
what
page
are
you
on
wes
cause
we
already
got
there
i
just
love
it
when
you
take
charge
you
man
you
i'll
go
i
don't
think
she'll
show
been
there
killed
that
she's
not
much
for
followup
cause
i'm
not
crazy
or
cause
i
don't
kill
people
i
hear
you
i
can't
kill
her
fun
as
it
may
sound
i
can
make
her
cry
uncle
though
and
i
mean
to
stopping
faith
is
my
work
take
a
beat
to
love
the
synergy
can
we
get
back
to
the
chase
uh
excuse
me
kind
of
professionally
four
years
running
how
what
about
the
spiders
the
mayor
had
a
box
of
spiders
that
he
had
to
eat
the
box
of
i
want
to
say
gravlocks
well
there
must
be
something
that
you
can
remember
that
would
be
helpful
you
never
get
even
a
little
tired
of
hearing
yourself
speak
do
you
get
out
mom
i
need
you
to
leave
town
tonight
yeah
that's
sort
of
the
idea
mom
graduation
is
a
pointless
ceremony
where
you
sit
around
and
listen
to
a
bunch
of
boring
speeches
until
someone
hands
you
a
piece
of
paper
that
says
you
graduated
which
you
already
know
and
maroon
does
nothing
for
my
complection
so
don't
argue
okay
just
promise
me
that
you'll
be
far
away
from
here
you
know
that
i
can't
mom
i
know
that
sometimes
you
wish
i
were
different
i
wish
i
could
be
a
lot
of
things
for
you
a
great
student
a
star
athlete
remotely
normal
i'm
not
but
there
is
something
i
do
that
i
can
do
better
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
i'm
gonna
fight
this
thing
but
i
can't
do
it
and
worry
about
you
you
stay
you'll
get
me
killed
you'll
have
to
trust
me
on
this
can
you
do
that
stealthy
what
are
you
doing
here
he's
afraid
i'll
run
into
faith
it's
gonna
happen
sooner
or
later
a
report
excavation
of
some
old
lava
bed
guy
was
a
volcanoologist
or
something
i
looked
through
it
but
the
only
thing
i
understood
were
the
commas
gonna
bring
it
to
giles
see
if
he
can
do
better
you
know
what
thank
you

i
can
take
it
from
here

into
the
ozone

all
i
know

have
to
work
together

is
a
million
tons
of
burning
lava

i'm
talking
about
watching
my
lover
die
i
don't
have
a
clue
what
you're
talking
about
and
i
don't
care
orders
i
don't
think
i'm
gonna
be
taking
any
more
orders
not
from
you
not
from
them
they're
in
england
i
don't
think
they
can
tell
which
way
my
back
is
facing
wesley
go
back
to
your
council
and
tell
them
until
the
next
slayer
comes
along
they
can
close
up
shop
i'm
not
working
for
them
anymore
i
have
a
strategy
you're
not
in
it
i
like
to
think
of
it
as
graduation
giles
i
can't
stay
here
any
longer
i'm
gonna
see
if
i
can
help
the
others
you'll
watch
him
get
a
job
and
the
cure
but
there
are
some
nothing
what
good
no
it's
perfect
angel
needs
to
drain
a
slayer
then
i'll
bring
him
one
not
if
she's
already
dead
someone
should
take
over
for
giles
after
a
while
watch
angel
it's
time
i
can't
play
kid
games
anymore
this
is
how
she
wants
it
i
won't
get
hurt
just
get
me
an
address
thought
i'd
stop
by
he's
not
gonna
die
it
was
a
good
try
though
your
plan
there's
a
cure
your
blood
as
justice
goes
it's
not
unpoetic
don't
you
think
not
a
problem
you
told
me
i
was
just
like
you
that
i
was
holding
it
in
try
me
stick
around
what's
the
matter
all
that
killing
you
afraid
to
die
you're
about
to
get
it
back
