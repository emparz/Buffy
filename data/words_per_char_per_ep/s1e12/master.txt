yes
yes
shake
earth
this
is
a
sign
we
are
in
the
final
days
my
time
has
come
glory
glory
whadaya
think
51
soon
soon
welcome
oh
good
the
feeble
banter
portion
of
the
fight
why
don't
we
just
cut
to
the
nice
shot
you're
not
going
to
kill
me
with
that
thing
you
still
don't
understand
your
part
in
all
this
do
you
you
are
not
the
hunter
you
are
the
lamb
i'm
waiting
for
you
i
want
this
moment
to
last
i
understand
you
tried
it
was
noble
of
you
you
heard
the
prophecy
that
i
was
about
to
break
free
and
you
came
to
stop
me
but
prophecies
are
tricky
creatures
they
don't
tell
you
everything
you're
the
one
that
sets
me
free
if
you
hadn't
come
i
couldn't
go
think
about
that
oh
god
the
power
and
by
the
way
i
like
your
dress
my
world
oh
my
beautiful
world
yes
come
forth
my
child
come
into
my
world
you're
dead
you
were
destined
to
die
it
was
written
come
here
did
you
really
think
you
could
best
me
here
when
you
couldn't
below
what
where
are
your
jibes
now
you
laugh
when
my
hell
is
on
earth
