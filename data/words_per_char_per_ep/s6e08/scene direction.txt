at
the
bar
staring
vacantly
in

of
her
i've
been
searchin'
deep
down
in
my
soul
words
that
i'm
hearin'
are
starting
to
get
old
buffy
looks
on
the
verge
of
tears
again
cut
back
to
the
band
onstage
feels
like
i'm
starting
all
over

to
everything
that

clothes
guitar
music
continues
cut
back
to
the
bronze
close
shot
on
the
singer
as
she
starts
the
second
verse
closin'
my
eyes
you
chase
my
thoughts
away
to
a
place
where
i
am
blinded
by
the
light
but
it's
not
right
goodbye
to
you
cut
back
to
willow
still
sitting
crying
goodbye
to
everything
that
i
knew

one
thing
that
i
tried
cut
back
to
buffy
in
the
bronze
to
hold
on
to
spike
walks
up
beside
buffy
she
looks
over
at
him
he
looks
at
her
questioningly
buffy
turns
her
face
away
from
spike
breathes
deeply
as
if
trying
to
hold
back
tears
spike
looks
frustrated
walks
away
fade
back
to
the
band
onstage
and
it
hurts
to
want
everything
and
nothing
at
the
same
time
i
want
what's
yours
and
i
want
what's
mine
the
song

for
a
moment
then
resumes
goodbye
to
everything
that
i
knew

is
on
the
porch
leaning
against
a
post

puts
her
box
on

before
she
can
touch
her
dawn
turns
and
runs
back
inside
you
were
the
one
i
loved
the
one
thing
that
i
tried
to
hold
on
to
tara
watches
dawn
go
looks
sad
goodbye
to
you
pan
around
the
stairs
and
we
discover

and
buffy
standing
underneath
the
stairs
kissing
goodbye
to
everything
that
i
knew

pulls
back
for
a
moment
then
resumes
kissing

were
the
one
