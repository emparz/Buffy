it's
totally
not
stupid
to
wonder
what
it
was
like
for
buffy
but
it
could
have
been
any
one
of
a
zillion
heavenly
dimensions
all
we
know
is
that

it
was
a
good
place
and
she
was
happy
there
not
to
be
miss
psycho
pep
squad
but
we
have
got
to
stop
obsessing
about
what
we
did
and
start
trying
to
make
things
better
for
buffy
no
no
more
spells
i
can't
believe
that
we
are
talking
about
this
again
you
know
how
powerful
magic
is
how
dangerous
you
could
hurt
someone
you

you
could
hurt
yourself
god
what
is
wrong
with
you
do
you
think
i'm
stupid
i
know
you
used
that
spell
on
me
if
you
don't
wanna
fight
you
don't
fight
you
don't
use
magic
to
make
a
fight
disappear
but
you
don't
get
to
decide
what
is
better
for
us
will
we're
in
a
relationship
we
are
supposed
to
decide
together
you
did
it
the
way
you're
doing
everything
when
things
get
rough
you

you
don't
even
consider
the
options
you
just

you
just
do
a
spell
it's
not
good
for
you
willow
and
it's
not
what
magic
is
for
maybe
that's
how
it
started
but

you're
helping
yourself
now
fixing
things
to
your
liking
including
me
i
don't
think
this
is
gonna
work
go
a
week
one
week
without
magic
go
a
week
and
then
we'll
see
i
don't
know
i
just

think
we
both
need
some

i
don't
know
space
oh
i
can't
believe
i'm
saying
this
fine
this
is
a
magic
shop
aaa
real
magic
shop
i
think
it's
pretty
tara
and
look
i'm
a
student
at
uc
sunnydale
maybe
it's
halloween
i
don't
know
but
we
nneed
our
memories
back
we
have
to
get
to
a
hospital
'slay
her'
that's
just
what
they
said
before
thththey're
gonna
use
the
spikes
to
buffy
to
slay
someone
a
female
someone
who
do
those
jerks
think
they
are
come
on
this
way
up
the
ladder
