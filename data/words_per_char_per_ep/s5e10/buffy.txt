and
you
didn't
tell
me

they're
around
somewhere
there's
gotta
be
a
way
to
find
these
creeps
i'm
not
ready
to
talk
to
you
yet
i'm
serious
unless
you
wanna
fight
and
say
what
riley
'what
were
you
thinking
how
long
have
you
been
lying
to
me'
nothing
you
say
right
now
is
gonna
make
this
better
fine
get
your
hand
off
of
me
i
did
not
let
dracula
you
so
don't
get
it
so
this
is
my
fault
hey
gee
buffy's
so
mysterious
i
think
i'll
go
out
and
almost
die
i
think
i'll
go
and
let
some
other
w
vampires
killers
i
can't
i
can't
hear
this
fine
fine
tell
me
about
your
whores
tell
me
what
on
earth
they
were
giving
you
that
i
can't
they
needed
your
money
it
wasn't
about
you
why
are
you
telling
me
this
and
i
don't

make
you
feel
that
way
how
on
earth
can
you
compare
me
to
that
how
can
you
tell
me
you
understand
what
those
vampires
are
feeling
you
aren't
a
passion
to
them
you
are
a
snack
a
willing
idiotic
snack
and
you
think
that
i
don't
feel
the
same
way
about
you
how
dare
you
tell
me
what
i
feel
oh
i'm
sorry
you
know
um
i'm
sorry
that
i
couldn't
take
care
of
you
when
i
thought
that
my
mother
was
dying
but
i
do
that's
part
of
what
being
a
slayer
is
and
that's
what
this
is
really
about
isn't
it
you
can't
handle
the
fact
that
i'm
stronger
than
you
then
what
what
else
do
you
want
from
me
riley
i've
given
you
everything
that
i
have
i've
given
you
my
heart
my
body
and
soul
well
whose
fault
is
that
because
i'm
telling
you
this
is
it
this
is
me
this
is
the
package
and
if
it's
so
deficient
that
you
need
to
get
your
kicks
elsewhere

really
have
a
problem
tonight
when
were
you
gonna
tell
me
