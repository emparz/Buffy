no
i'm
fine
it
doesn't
mean
anything
i'd
worry
more
if
your
mom
was
out
of
surgery
quickly
might
mean
that
you
know
they
couldn't
do
much
whatever
you
want
absolutely
oh

'cause
i
had
that
scheduled
for
a
little
later
on
always
i
want
tonight
to
be
special
for
you
well
i'm
glad
you
deserve
it
after
everything
you've
been
through
it
was
a
lot
and
you
were
incredible
don't
sell
yourself
short
you
stayed
strong
throughout
buffy
you
never
even
cried
oh
harder
buffy
buffy
back
off
man
i
didn't
know
i
said
back
off
get
out
i'm
not
in
a
talkin'
mood
talk
fast
and
you're
telling
me
this
because
i'm
a
civilian
i
quit
the
government
a
long
way
back
what
do
you
need
me
for
you
may
have
noticed
spike
i
left
reasonable
about
three
exits
back
why
the
hell
not
plastic
woodgrain
looks
real
doesn't
it
don't
think
i
don't
know
what's
goin'
on
with
you
spike
stay
away
from
her
or
we'll
do
this
for
real
next
time
what
because
you
are
maybe
i
didn't
almost
kill
you
enough
shut
up
you
actually
think
you've
got
a
shot
with
her
i'm
the
lucky
guy
yeah
i'm
the
guy
she
in
there
would
you
guys
mind
clearing
out
i
need
a
minute
alone
with
her
we
need
to
talk
too
bad
so
let's
fight
we
need
to
have
this
out
buffy
right
now
i
realize
that
i
don't
expect
i
just
need
you
to
hear
me
out
i
think
when
this
thing
started
it
was
just
some
stupid
immature
game
i
wanted
to
even
the
score
after
you
let
dracula
bite
you
i
know
on
some
level
i
know
that
but
i
was
still
spun
i
don't
know
i

i
wanted
to
know
what
you
felt
i
wanted
to
know
why
dracula
and
angel
have
so
much
power
over
you
i
wanted
to
get
it
buffy
i
wanted
to
get
you
this
isn't
your
fault
it's
mine
i
feel
like
hell
for
what
i've
put
you
through
it's
just
these
girls
they
made
me
feel
something
buffy
something
i
didn't
even
know
i
was
missing
until
you
need
to
hear
this
they
needed
me
no
on
some
basic
level
it
was
about
me
my
blood
my
body
when
they
bit
me

it
was
beyond
passion
they
wanted
to
devour
me
all
of
me
it
wasn't
real
i
know
it
was
just
physical
but
the
fact
that
i
craved
it

that
that
i
kept
going
back

even
if
it
was
fleeting
they
made
me
feel
like
they
had
such
hunger
for
me
no
i
know
exactly
what
they
feel
when
they
bite
me
because
i
feel
it
every
time
we're
together
it's
like
the
whole
world
falls
away
and
all
there
is
is
you
you
keep
me
at
a
distance
buffy
you
didn't
even
call
me
when
your
mom
went
into
the
hospital
it's
about
me
taking
care
of
you
it's
about
letting
me
in
so
you
don't
have
to
be
on
top
of
everything
all
the
time
it's
hard
sometimes
yeah
but
that's
not
it
you
say
that
but
i
don't
feel
it
i
just
don't
feel
it
they
want
me
back
buffy

military

deep
undercover

contact
