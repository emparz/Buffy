just
me
sorry
can
i
get
you
anything
riley
and
so
it
begins
no
longer
a
victim
of
crass
holiday
commercialization
i'm

a
purveyor
of
it
oh
yeah
dear
holiday
memories
merry
tykes
by
the
fire
enjoying
their
new
christmas

chicken
feet
i
say
that's
an
exaggeration
please
stop
i
beg
of
you
a
nest
what
sort
of
and
the

hazards
of
the
underworld
can
become
addictive
to

some
people
but
still
iit
can
be
terribly
dangerous
for
humans
i
mean
people
can
end
up
dying
accidentally
or
or
meeting
a
a
vampire
who
only
pretends
to
play
by
the
house
rules
i
hadn't
seen
it
since
my
ripper
days
i
had
no
idea
it
was
going
on
in
sunnydale
buffy
even
if
i
had
known
about
this
i
might
not
have
told
you
right
now
well
i'm
not
sure
this
is
where
your
efforts
are
best
spent
perhaps
you
should
focus
on

a
less
ambiguous
evil
glory
for
instance
they're
willing
victims
i
mean
there
are
people
out
there
who
deserve
your
help
who
aren't
anya
will
you
mind
the
store
it's
hard
to
say
i'm
sure
they'll
lie
low
for
a
bit
