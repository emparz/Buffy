that's
disturbing
you're
emotionally
scarred
and
will
end
up
badly
well
we
could
play
that
game
again
life
that
was
fun
well

we
can
make
a
wager
this
time
you
can
give
me
real
money
that
would
be
different
i
don't
think
the
bar
would
serve
her
but
we
could
bring
something
in
strawberry
schnapps
taste
just
like
real
ice
cream
there's
a
chimp
playing
hockey
we
have
to
see
the
chimp
playing
hockey
that's
hilarious
the
ice
is
so
slippery
and
and
monkeys
are
all
irrational
we
have
to
see
this
go
monkey
choose
monkey
he's
not
very
convincing
is
he
oh
does
that
mean
we
can't
oh
who
ordered
more
chickens'
feet
the
ones
we
have
aren't
moving
at
all
i'm
serious
maybe
we
could
do
a

holiday
promotion
one
free
with
every
purchase
that's
so
very
humorous
make
fun
of
the
exdemon
i
can
just
hear
you
in
private
'i
dislike
that
anya
she's
newly
human
and
strangely
literal'
there's
nothing
wrong
with
my
idea
anyway
i've
been
very
good
for
this
store
if
it
wasn't
for
me
giles
would
be
a
terrified
old
man
staring
at
a
quarterly
tax
statement
and
wetting
himself
yes
i
forgot
about
all
the
vigorous
sitting
around
i'm
sorry
willow
thank
you
for
making
time
in
your
busy
life
to
come
in
here
and
get
in
the
way
of
mine
you
know
fine
take
her
side
instead
of
mine
even
though
i'm
the
one
who
sleeps
with
you
and
feeds
you
bathes
you
oh
that's
been
going
on
for
centuries
humans
hire
vampires
to
feed
off
them
they
well
you
know
theythey
get
off
on
the
rush
because
they
get
cash
hot
and
cold
running
blood
and

they
don't
leave
any
corpses
behind
so
they
don't
get
hunted
have
a
nice
day
don't
get
killed
a
while
now
seems
pretty
gungho
about
it
too
didn't
even
stop
to
say
hello
oh
i
don't
know
maybe
you're
overreacting
i
mean
who
hasn't
done
stuff
like
that
from
time
to
time
i
mean
i
made
this
one
guy
spontaneously
combust
and
he
set
his
whole
village
on
fire
a
little
afterhours
hankypanky
in
the
training
room
huh
boy
xander
and
i
could
tell
you
some
stories
there's
a
funny
thing
with
the
vaulting
horse
that
you
can
tr
what
he
started
it
oh
uh
well
maybe
we
can
go
home
and
you
know
have
'em
