fear
is
a
wonderful
thing
it
is
the
most
powerful
force
in
the
human
world
not
love
not
hate
fear
when
you
were
a
mortal
boy
what
did
you
fear
ooo
we
are
defined
by
the
things
we
fear
this
symbol
these
two
planks
of
wood
it
confounds
me
suffuses
me
with
mortal
dread
but
fear
is
in
the
mind
like
pain
it
can
be
controlled
if
i
can
face
my
fear
it
cannot
master
me
something
is
happening
above
something
new
powerful
psychic
force
do
you
feel
it
change
yes
for
the
worse
nobody
died
what's
the
fun
of
burying
someone
if
they're
already
dead
so
this
is
the
slayer
you're
prettier
than
the
last
one
you
still
don't
understand
do
you
i
am
free
because
you
fear
it
because
you
fear
it
the
world
is
crumbling
your
nightmares
are
made
flesh
you
have
little
billy
to
thank
for
that
a
dream
is
a
wish
your
heart
makes
this
is
real
life
come
on
slayer

are
you
afraid
of
how
'bout
being
buried
alive
