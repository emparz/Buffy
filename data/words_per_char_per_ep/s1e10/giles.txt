i
was
uh
in
the
stacks
i
got
lost
i
couldn't
find
anything
uh
particularly
illuminating
um
i
think
perhaps
you'd
best
have
a
chat
with
wendell
himself
do
you
know
the
girl
well
i
was
rather
hoping
that
laura
did
i
hope
we're
not
intruding
um
you
understand
we're
anxious
to
make
sure
this
this
doesn't
happen
again
can
you
describe
it
yes
you
you
you
just
rest
now
i'm
sorry
yes
yes
it
is
take
care
doctor
is
she
gonna
be
alright
have
you
looked
up
the
word
lately
this
can't
be
happening
this
can't
be
oh
uh
i've
got
back
issues
of
the
uh
papers
um
to
try
to
do
some
research
i
don't
know
i'm
having
a
problem
ii
can't
read
five
actually
on
a
normal
day
ththe
words
here
don't
make
any
ssense
iit's
gibberish
who
the
first
victim
uh
you
you've
seen
him
around
the
school
uh
the
boy's
been
in
a
coma
for
a
week
how
can
this
be
possible
uh
well
um
there's
astral
projection
uh
the
theory
that
while
one
sleeps
one
has
another
body
aan
astral
body
which
can
travel
through
time
and
space
in
a
manner
of
speaking
aaalthough
one
doesn't
always
awake
from
a
coma
astral
body
and
ii
don't
know
as
usual
one
doesn't
have
an
inordinate
amount
of
information
to
work
with
my
pleasure
uh
she
she
just
stepped
out
her
her
father
came
by
early
he
he
needed
to
talk
to
her
w
where
are
your
other
clothes
ii
dreamt
that
i
got
lost
in
the
stacks
and
i
i
couldn't
read
of
course
dreams
that
would
be
a
musical
comedy
version
of
this
nightmares
our
our
nightmares
are
coming
true
billy
he's
a
boy
in
the
local
hospital
he
was
beaten
he's
in
a
coma
somehow
i
think
he's
crossed
over
from
the
nightmare
world
he's
trapped
in
things
like
that
are
easy
when
you
live
on
a
hellmouth
and
soon
or
else
everyone
in
sunnydale
is
gonna
be
facing
their
own
worst
nightmares
buffy
doesn't
know
this
is
happening
and
given
the
sort
of
thing
that
she
tends
to
dream
about
it's
imperative
that
we
find
her
they
come
through
the
doors
into
the
hall
good
idea
no
sign
of
buffy
you
seem
to
be
the
only
one
things
are
getting
worse
in
a
few
hours
reality
will
fold
completely
into
the
realm
of
nightmares
the
only
thing
i
can
think
is
to
try
and
wake
billy
agreed
but
who
knows
where
she
might
have
gone
it's
mine
i've
failed
in
my
duty
to
protect
you
i
should
have
been
more
c
cautious
taken
more
time
to
train
you
but
you
were
so
gifted
and
the
evil
was
so
great
i'm
sorry
buffy
you
never
told
me
you
dreamt
of
becoming
a
vampire
no
no
it's
not
but
there's
a
chance
that
we
can
make
it
go
away
this
all
comes
from
billy
now
if
if
we
can
only
wake
him
up
i
believe
that
the
nightmares
will
stop
and
reality
will
shift
back
into
place
but
we
must
do
it
now
i
need
you
to
hold
together
long
enough
to
help
us
can
you
do
that
thank
you
oh
uh
positive
willow
do
shut
up
doctor
is
the
boy
billy
still
here
um
billy
billy
billy
uh
billy
you
have
to
wake
up
why
from
what
let's
get
a
doctor
