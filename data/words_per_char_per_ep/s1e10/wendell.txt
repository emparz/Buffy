want
something
i
don't
know
what
to
say
about
that
they're
not
insects

arachnids
spiders
are
arachnids
they
have
eight
legs
insects
only
have
six
why
does
everyone
make
that
mistake
lots
of
times
i
don't
hate
spiders
i
love
'em
they
hate
me
i
had
the
best
collection
in
the
tricounty
area
browns
and
tarantulas
and
black
widows
then
my
folks
shipped
me
off
to
wilderness
camp
all
my
brother
had
to
do
was
maintain
their
habitats
instead
he
left
their
heat
lamp
on
for
a
week
when
i
came
home
they
were
all
dead
that's
when
the
nightmares
started
it's
always
the
same
i'm
sitting
in
the
classroom
teacher
asks
me
to
read
something
i
open
up
my
book
and
then
there
they
are
they're
comin'
after
me
god
can
you
blame
them
after
what
i
did
yesterday
in
class
i
thought
i'd
just
nodded
off
again
but
then
everyone
else
started
screaming
too
