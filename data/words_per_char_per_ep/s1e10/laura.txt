well
they
both
got
detention
which
is
completely
unfair
since
sean
started
it
anyway
it
means
we
can't
do
the
movie
i'm
gonna
take
a
break
hi
that's
okay
i
don't
wanna
be
left
alone
i
was
in
the
basement
i
went
down
for
a
smoke
there
was
someone
there
i've
never
seen
anything
like
it
'lucky
nineteen'
buffy
and
giles
stop
and
turn
around
it's
what
he
said
right
before
he
said
'lucky
nineteen'
that's
weird
right
