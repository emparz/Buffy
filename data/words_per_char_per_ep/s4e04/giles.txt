happy
hallow

hello
buffy
it's
a
sombrero
it
seemed
festive
uhm
come
in
candy
i
never
said
any
such
a
thing
as
my
watcher's
duties
took
precedence
i
simply
haven't
taken
time
to
–
well
to
embrace
its
inherent
charms
–
until
now
look
look
it's
alive
see
–
how
he
shakes

is
–
is
there
something
you
wanted
oh
yes
of
course
i
see
is
there
some
specific
danger
you
were
sensing
true
but
what
happened
then
was
anomalous
creatures
of
the
night
shy
away
form
halloween
they
find
it
all
much
too
crass
well
ii
promise
you

there
is
little
likelihood
of
any
supernatural
activity
tonight
you
sure
you
don't
want
one
just
a
minute

coming
happy
hall
anya
uh
ah
where
is
buffy
and
the
others
slow
down
i
need
you
to
be
more
specific
she
vanished
from
the
window
hmm
matter
and
reality
distortion
like
a
summoning
spell's
temporal
flux
hmm
oh
never
mind
i
just
need
to
get
some

supplies
together
i
wouldn't
worry
about
xander
at
least
he's
amongst
friends
we're
gonna
have
to
create
a
door
i
can
the
walls
closed
up
behind
us
gachnar
of
course
it's
presence
infects
the
reality
of
the
house
but
it's
not
managed
to
achieve
full
manifestation
we
can
not
allow
this
to
come
into
being
buffy
this
is
gachnar
i
have
it
i
have
it
uhm
'the
summoning
spell
for
gachnar
can
be
shut
down
in
one
of
two
ways
destroying
the
mark
of
gachnar
–
is
not
one
of
them
and
will
in
fact
immediately
bring
forth
the
fear
demon
itself
don't
taunt
the
fear
demon
no
it's
just
–
tacky
be
that
as
it
may
buffy
when
it
comes
to
slaying
please
finish
them
oh
bloody
hell
the
inscription
i
should
have
translated
the
gaelic
inscription
under
the
illustration
of
gachnar
actual
size
