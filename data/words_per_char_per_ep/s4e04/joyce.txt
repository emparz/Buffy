i'm
just
glad
i
could
find
it
there
try
it
now
i
let
down
the
hem
and
loosened
it
a
little
around
the
hood
i'm
sorry
i'm
thinking
about
the
little
girl
who
wore
that
what
is
it
five
six
years
ago
your
father
loved
to
take
you
out
he
just
wanted
to
keep
you
safe
oh
that's
not
true
actually
the
candy
was
for
me

your
father
loved
spending
time
with
you
buffy
our
divorce
had
nothing
to
do
with
you
i
thought
it
might
be
easier
you
must
have
noticed
that
i
am
not
exactly
the
social
butterfly
i
was
when
i
was
with
your
dad
i
don't
think
i
made
a
single
new
friend
the
year
we
moved
to
sunnydale
fear
i
didn't
believe
i
could
trust
anyone
again
it's
taken
time
and
a
lot
of
effort
but
i've
got
a
nice
circle
of
friends
now

i
mean
don't
get
me
wrong
i
â€“
i'm
still
a
little
gun
shy
it
certainly
didn't
help
that
my
last
boyfriend
turned
out
to
be
a
homicidal
robot
i
will
always
be
here
for
you
and
you
got
mr
giles
and
your
friends
believe
me
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
