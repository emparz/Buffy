her
feet
and
turns
to
face
him
in
a
front
stance
when
he
gets
up
she
punches
him
in
the
face
and
kicks
him
in
the
stomach
with
a
hopping
front
snap
kick
he
staggers
backward
and
stumbles
into
his
disappearingact
box
and
the
door
closes
on
him
willow
keeps
hacking
at
the
lock
on
the
guillotine
that
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
because
marc
just
punches
through
the
box
and
reaches
for
her
she
quickly
backs
away
as
he
kicks
and
shoves
his
way
out
of
the
box
he
has
completely
reverted
to
his
demon
form
now
he
comes
at
her
grabs
her
by
the
neck
and
lifts
her
from
the
floor
giles
yells
willow
keeps
hacking
the
demon
slams
buffy
up
against
a
wall
with
his
hand
around
her
throat
he
pulls
her
away
and
slams
her
into
the
wall
again
xander
can
only
watch
as
he
holds
on
to
the
rope
willow
gets
the
lock
to
break
and
quickly
pulls
it
off
she
and
giles
push
the
head
restraint
up
and
he
gets
out
as
fast
as
he
can
he
reaches
down
to
undo
the
restraint
at
his
feet
sid
finally
shows
up
jumps
onto
the
demon's
back
and
begins
stabbing
with
his
knife
the
demon
ignores
sid
and
continues
slamming
buffy
into
the
wall
giles
gets
himself
loose
sid
has
forced
the
demon
to
let
go
of
buffy
and
has
jumped
off
she
hits
the
demon
in
the
face
with
an
open
hand
punch
followed
by
a
backhand
punch
giles
gets
off
of
the
bench
as
buffy
does
a
full
spinning
side
kick
to
the
demon's
gut
making
him
stagger
back
onto
the
bench
and
land
with
his
neck
in
the
guillotine
buffy
to
xander
xander
lets
go
and
the
blade
falls
chopping
off
the
demon's
head
its
body
slumps
lifeless
on
the
bench
willow
cringes
at
the
sight
they
all
stare
at
what's
left
of
the
demon
he
has
positioned
himself
over
the
demon's
chest
with
his
knife
she
holds
out
her
hand
for
the
knife
he
wields
back
with
the
knife
and
plunges
it
into
the
demon's
heart
he
pulls
back
to
do
it
again
but
his
aim
was
true
the
first
time
and
he
just
slumps
over
onto
the
demon
with
the
knife
still
in
his
hands
now
a
lifeless
puppet
buffy
looks
at
sid
sadly
and
lets
out
a
deep
breath
giles
takes
off
his
glasses
buffy
gently
lifts
sid
from
the
demon
and
holds
him
in
her
arms
she
starts
to
walk
offstage
