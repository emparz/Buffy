learning
to
love
yourself
is
the
greatest
love
of
all
i
decided
long
ago
never
to
walk
in
anyone's
shadow
if
i
fail
if
i
succeed
at
least
but
i
didn't
do
the
part
with
the
sparklers
uhhh
it's
just
such
a
tragedy
for
me
emma
was
like
my
best
friend
all
i
can
think
is
it
coulda
been
me
i
don't
understand
why
i
why
i
have
to
follow
brett
and
his
stupid
band
but
the
mood
it'll
be
all
wrong
my
song
is
about
dignity
and
human
feelings
and
personal
hygiene
or
something
anyway
it's
sappy
and
no
one
is
gonna
be
feeling
sappy
after
all
that
rock
and
roll
uhhh
what
there's
something
wrong
with
my
hair
ohmigod
looks
like
someone
digs
you
that's
adorable
you
and
the
dummy
could
tour
in
the
freak
show
i
i
can't
go
out
there
all
those
people
staring
at
me
and
judging
me
like
i'm
some
kind
of
buffy
what
if
i
mess
up
eww
even
mrs
franklin
uhhh
yeah
