i
think
they
call
'em
'principals'
now
and
laugh
please
i
think
dummies
are
cute
you
don't
what
happened
a
dramatic
scene
is
the
easiest
way
to
get
through
the
talent
show
because
it
doesn't
require
an
actual
talent
maybe
in
a
funny
way
a
little
oh
iin
front
of
other
people
then
no
i
don't
play
morgan
you're
really
getting
good
where
did
you
come
up
with
that
voice
emily
dancer
emily
yikes
so
emily
was
killed
by
a
regular
human
person
the
creep
factor
is
also
heightened
it
could
be
anyone
it
could
be
me
it's
not
though
morgan
strange
how
i
think
i
had
a
bit
more
luck
everyone
i
talked
to
seemed
to
point
their
fingers
at
the
same
person
morgan
we
could
set
up
a
complex
sting
operation
where
we
get
him
to
confess
and
for
his
puppet
like
a
heart
i'll
pull
up
his
locker
number
with
morgan
you
did
say
they
creep
you
out
well
on
the
side
of
the
'morgan's
just
crazy'
theory
there
is
well
morgan
so
morgan
could
still
be
the
guy
only
demon
morgan
instead
of
crazy
morgan
what
do
we
do
with
him
once
again
i'm
banished
to
the
demon
section
of
the
card
catalog
that's
okay
you
can
have
the
organs
look
what
i
found
in
the
section
on
toys
and
magic
'on
rare
occasions
inanimate
objects
of
human
quality
such
as
dolls
and
mannequins
already
mystically
possessed
of
consciousness
have
acted
upon
their
desire
to
become
human
by
harvesting
organs'
giles
emily's
heart
morgan's
dummy
uhhh
and
ever
since
then
you've
been
a
living
dummy
he
was
look
at
his
grades
all
a's
he
was
even
taking
college
classes
wait
a
second
all
these
sick
days
look
at
this
'in
case
of
emergency
contact
dr
dale
leggett
california
institute
of
neurosurgery
cancer
ward'
xander
brain
cancer
that's
why
he
had
all
the
headaches
what
what
could
a
demon
possibly
want
from
me
29
oh
yeah
that's
because
they
were
all
there
but
that's
before
we
found
the
brain
where
are
the
keys
