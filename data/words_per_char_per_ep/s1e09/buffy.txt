all
we

is
that
morgan
is
a
grade
a
large
weirdo
that
doesn't
lead
directly
to
murderer
well
yeah
but
what
about
the
whole
'it's
a
demon'
theory
uh
priority
check
giles
this
is
so
unfair
alright
okay
two
to
the
left
three
to
the
right
principal
snyder
uh
looking
for
something
and
i'm
going
any
minute
now
well
i
don't
do
any
of
those
things
not
ever
oh
yeah
right
um
a
friend
wanted
me
to
get
something
out
of
his
case
he
must've
taken
it
and
just
forgotten
to
tell
me
it'll
be
over
soon
seeing
iin
the
sense
of
actually
attending
uhuh
no
mom
yyyou
can't
and
i
mean
if
i
know
you're
out
there
watching
i'll
freeze
up
stage
fright
look
mom
if
you
really
love
me
and
wanna
show
your
support
you'll
stay
away
far
away
nothing
there's
just
a
lot
going
on
right
now
good
plan
in
the
bed
in
the
covers
there's
something
there's
something
there
no
there's
some
there
is
yeah
you're
probably
right
i'm
sorry
i
got
you
up
i
didn't
where's
morgan
no
it
was
his
sid
the
dummy
okay
everyone
look
at
me
like
i'm
in
a
bunny
suit
'cause
that's
how
stupid
i
feel
saying
this
i
think
sid
was
in
my
room
last
night
no
he
was
alone
and
alive
well
i
saw
something
iit
ran
across
my
floor
under
my
bed
and
then
it
attacked
me
it
was
like
it
pounced
on
my
face
yeah
exactly
but
when
i
turned
the
lights
on
it
was
already
gone
ii
think
it
went
out
my
window
yeah
no
it
was
sid
the
dummy
excuse
me
can
i
have
a
little
support
here
please
i'm
not
just
some
crazy
person
i'm
the
slayer
i'd
like
to
see
morgan
without
his
better
half
for
a
few
minutes
bet
he
could
tell
me
something
where
did
you
get
that
i
really
don't
think
you
should
be
doing
that
xander
quit
it
i'll
go
find
morgan
you
watch
the
dummy
morgan
morgan
principal
snyder
have
you
seen
morgan
shay
well
i
was
just
leaving
and
i
know
how
to
take
care
of
myself
morgan
morgan
demon's
got
himself
a
brain
who's
ever
out
there
i'm
gonna
hurt
you
badly
if
you'll
just
gimme
a
minute
i'm
sure
they
would
have
made
great
trophies
for
your
case
yeah
except
for
one
thing
you
lost
and
now
you'll
never
be
human
because
you
thought
i
was
the
demon
yeah
but
now
that
demon
has
what
he
wants
he'll
be
moving
on
we'll
know
who
our
demon
is
what
okay
um
start
pulling
everyone's
addresses
in
the
talent
show
iif
they're
not
there
maybe
we
can
catch
them
at
home
i'm
a
vampire
slayer
so
you
kill
the
demon
and
the
curse
is
lifted
right
you
don't
actually
turn
into
a
prince
do
you
ii
mean
your
body
you
mean
dead
so
that
horny
dummy
thing
really
isn't
an
act
is
it
yuk
hold
on
so
the
demon
isn't
in
the
show
right
sid
sid
i'm
never
gonna
stop
washing
my
hands
sid's
on
the
level
i'm
sure
of
it
but
why
would
the
demon
have
rejected
the
brain
ii
mean
i
thought
morgan
was
the
smartest
kid
in
school
what
check
the
school
nurse's
file
this
means
that
whatever's
out
there
still
needs
a
healthy
intelligent
brain
and
it's
gonna
be
looking
for
the
smartest
person
around
don't
worry
willow
as
long
as
you're
with
us
there's
absolutely
no
way
that
demon
is
gonna
get
what
he
wants
this
is
ridiculous
we
can't
just
sit
here
and
wait
for
him
to
come
to
us
we
have
to
figure
out
who
we're
dealing
with
no
okay
so
we
ruled
out
all
the
people
in
the
talent
show
right
so
it
probably
is
one
of
them
and
and
giles
doesn't
know
he's
with
them
all
right
now
giles
ewww
how
do
you
lock
this
thing
let
go
what
are
you
doing
let
me
