thank
you
cordelia
thathat's
going
to
be
lovely
um
wwe'll
um
save
that
for
the
dress
rehearsal
uh
lisa
please
oh
you
three
our
new
f√£hrer
mr
snyder
mm
he
thought
it
would
behoove
me
to
have
more
contact
with
the
students
i
did
try
to
explain
that
my
vocational
choice
of
librarian
was
a
deliberate
attempt
to
minimize
said
contact
but
uh
he
would
have
none
of
it
if
you
had
any
shred
of
decency
you
would
have
participated
or
at
least
um
helped
thank
you
there
you
see
i'm
sure
you
three
can
come
up
with
something
i
i
think
perhaps
it
was
a
little
more
complex
than
um
it
was
emily
uh
it
must
have
happened
just
after
uh
dress
rehearsals
there
was
a
crosscountry
meet
at
melville
she
she
she
never
showed
up
for
it
um
i
think
not
her
heart
was
removed
uh
there
are
various
demons
which
which
feed
off
human
hearts
but
which
more
than
likely
makes
our
murderer
the
evidence
certainly
points
that
way
i'd
like
to
think
you're
right
a
demon
is
a
creature
of
evil
pure
and
very
simple
a
person
driven
to
kill
is
is
um
it's
more
complex
uh
demon
or
no
we
have
some
investigating
to
do
i
suggest
we
start
with
your
your
talent
show
compatriots
one
of
them
may
have
been
the
last
to
see
her
alive
uh
um
do
you
remember
the
last
time
you
saw
her
who
i
fear
i
was
led
to
the
same
conclusion
i'm
looking
into
that
but
uh
my
investigation
is
somewhat
hampered
by
our
life
in
the
theater
principal
snyder
is
watching
us
all
very
closely
now
if
he
chooses
he
can
make
all
our
lives
extremely
difficult
a
slayer
cannot
afford
that
we
will
find
this
murderer
but
in
the
meantime
the
show
must
go
on
buffy
you
uh
watch
morgan
check
his
locker
see
if
there's
anything
there
or
something
because
we
have
to
clear
their
equipment
before
the
finale
i
told
you
oh
i'm
sorry
um
your
hair
uh
xander
was
right
it
worked
like
a
charm
hello
you
look
a
bit
worse
for
uh
what
exactly
are
you
the
worse
for
uh
i
i
haven't
seen
him
attacked
you
how
or
possibly
the
nightmare
of
somebody
who
had
dummies
on
her
mind
oh
uh
iif
it's
any
consolation
i
i
may
have
found
a
possible
demon
culprit
thethere's
a
reference
in
here
to
a
brotherhood
of
seven
demons
who
take
uh
the
form
of
young
humans
every
seven
years
these
demons
need
human
organs
aaa
brain
and
a
heart
to
maintain
their
humanity
otherwise
they
they
they
revert
back
to
their
original
form
which
is
uh
uh
slightly
less
appealing
it's
said
that
these
demons
are
are
are
preternaturally
strong
and
and
and
morgan
is
is
well
he
seems
to
be
getting
weaker
every
day
i
imagine
he's
looking
for
his
puppet
willow
we
have
some
hunting
of
our
own
to
do
you
concentrate
on
reanimation
theory
i'll
peck
about
in
organ
harvesting
unless
of
course
you
prefer
mm
what
is
it
what
oh
i
must
say
it's
a
welcome
change
to
have
someone
else
explain
all
these
things
the
show
it's
gonna
start
i'm
supposed
to
be
there
um
uh
the
what
right
fifteen
minutes
to
curtain
everyone
uh
fifteen
minutes
cordelia
there
uh
therethere's
uh
uh
an
adage
uh
that
uh
if
you're
feeling
nervous
then
uh
you
should
imagine
the
entire
audience
are
in
their
underwear
perhaps
not
um
alright
um
we'll
assemble
on
the
stage
in
five
minutes
for
the
um
uh
power
thing
iis
everybody
here
quickly
everyone
uh
um
power
circle
well
that's
that
then
um
everybody
uh
get
ready
no
one's
missing
it
seems
not
uh
tell
the
others
look
it's
nearly
curtain
i
must
get
the
show
rolling
right
yes
if
you
you
calibrated
the
units
of
weight
then
you
could
calculate
the
uh
specific
maximum
velocity
achieved
before
the
point
of
impact
oh
my
are
you
sure
there's
no
one
else
who
could
help
you
out
uh
uh
how
how
exactly
does
it
work
shshshouldn't
it
be
aimed
at
my
neck
what
exactly
is
the
trick
marc
mmarc
marc's
got
it
hurry
what's
happening
uh
i
must
say
all
of
you
your
ttiming
is
impeccable
