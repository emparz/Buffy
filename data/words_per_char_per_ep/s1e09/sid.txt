a
little
rehearsin'
on

how
strong
she

she's
the
last
just
this
one
more
and
i'll

other
things
on
his

that
woulda
been
justice
yeah
well
neither
will
you
this
is
what
i
do
i
hunt
demons
yeah
you
wouldn't
know
it
to
look
at
me
let's
just
say
there
was
me
there
was
a
really
mean
demon
there
was
a
curse
and
the
next
thing
i
know
i'm
not
me
anymore
i'm
sitting
on
some
guy's
knee
with
his
hand
up
my
shirt
the
kid
here
was
right
all
along
i
shoulda
picked
you
to
team
up
with
but
i
didn't
because
who
can
blame
me
for
thinking
look
at
you
you're
strong
athletic
limber
nubile
i'm
back
in
any
case
now
that
this
demon's
got
the
heart
and
brain
he
gets
to
keep
the
human
form
he's
in
for
another
seven
years
there
were
seven
of
these
guys
i've
killed
six
if
i
can
get
the
last
one
the
curse
will
be
lifted
and
i'll
be
free
i'm
sure
it's
someone
in
that
stupid
talent
show
so
once
we
know
who's
missing
from
the
show
and
you
get
'em
all
on
stage
form
the
power
circle
then
we
can
see
who's
a
noshow
the
power
circle
you
get
everyone
together
you
get
'em
you
know
revved
up
how'd
he
ever
get
that
gig
so
what's
your
deal
kid
i
don't
figure
you
for
a
demon
hunter
you
you're
the
slayer
damn
i
knew
a
slayer
in
the
30's
korean
chick

hot
we're
talking
muscle
tone
man
we
had
some
times
hey
that
was
pre
dummy
alright
now
i
was
a
guy
that's
the
drill
is
dust
and
bones
when
i
say
free
don't
get
sniffly
on
me
sis
i've
lived
a
lot
longer
than
most
demon
hunters
or
slayers
for
that
matter
of
course
if
you
want
to
snuggle
up
and
comfort
me
nope
okay
here

our
lineup

found
you
and
now
for
the
big
finish

not
enough
