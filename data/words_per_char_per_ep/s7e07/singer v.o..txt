i
fall
and
where
were
you
wolf
grin
and
where
were
you
i
fell
into
the
moon
can
i
spend
the
night
high
tide
inside
the
air
is
dew
and
where
were
you
while
i
i
crawled
out
of
the
world
and
you
said
i
shouldn't
stay
i
crawled
out
of
the
world
can
i
make
it
right
can
i
spend
the
night
alone
i
fell
into
the
moon
and
it
covered
you
in
blue
i
fell
into
the
moon
can
i
make
it
right
can
i
spend
the
night
alone
