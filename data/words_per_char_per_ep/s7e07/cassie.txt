so
this
is
the
uc
library
huh
it's
so
big
hey
yeah
i
know
it's
kinda
weird
'cause
we
never
really
met
yeah
well
no
no
i'm
here
i
mean
notnot
here
here
it's
kinda
complicated
kind
of
ironic
too
you
know
i
wrote
all
that
intense
poetry
about
the
end
and
here
i
am
again
chatting
you
up
i
knew
this
would
completely
freak
you
out
it's
just
she
asked
that
i
come
talk
to
you
it's
important
don't
worry
i'm
not
gona
hurt
you
or
anything
she
says
she
still
sings
remember
that
time
on
the
bridge
when
you
sang
to
each
other
well
she
says
even
though
you
can't
hear
it
she
still
sings
to
you
she's
sorry
she
couldn't
come
herself
she
just
can't
because
of
what
you
did
you
killed
people
you
can't
see
her
that's
just
how
it
is
i'm
sorry
she's
crying
she
misses
you
too
she
wishes
she
could
touch
you
it
will
it
can
but
you're
not
you're
strong
like
an
amazon
remember
well
you
were
grieving
it
was
the
power
the
power
is
bigger
than
you
are
things
are
more
clear
where
tara
is
where
we
are
we
can
see
your
path
and
you
have
to
stop
you
can't
use
magic
again
not
ever
it's
too
dangerous
you
can't
take
the
chance
that
you'll
lose
control
of
course
you
don't
she
says
you're
not
gonna
be
ok
you're
gonna
kill
everybody
that's
why
i
came
we
needed
to
warn
you
you
don't
want
to
know
what
we
saw
but
if
you
stopcompletely
no
more
magic
you
can't
if
you
do
so
much
as
another
spell
don't
think
that
way
well
there
is
one
thingone
thing
you
could
do
to
stop
it
and
you
could
see
her
you
wouldn't
have
to
talk
through
me
that's
what
you
want
isn't
it
so
go
be
with
her
everybody
will
be
safe
and
you'll
be
together
again
it's
not
that
bad
really
it's
just
like
going
to
sleep
suicide
thing
was
too
far
huh
hmm
you
seemed
so
ripe
i
stand
by
my
opinion
the
world
would
be
a
better
place
if
you
took
a
razorblade
to
your
wrist
i
can
see
it
now
candlelight
the
indigo
girls
playing
picture
of
your
dead
girlfriend
on
your
bloody
lap
oh
baby
you
left
such
a
big
hole
it
hurt
so
bad
you
don't
know
hurt
this
last
year's
gonna
seem
like
cake
after
what
i
put
you
and
your
friends
through
and
i
am
not
a
fan
of
easy
death
fact
is
the
whole
goodversusevil
balancing
the
scales
thingi'm
over
it
i'm
done
with
the
mortal
coil
but
believe
me
i'm
going
for
a
big
finish
oh
not
it
me
