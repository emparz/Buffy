chest
she
struggles

fire
going
in

clear
though
that
no

for
years
the

stop
and
look
across
the

a
tall
wooden
crate
with
a
heavy
lock
on
it
giles
absently
he
sets
the
largest
blue
crystal
on
the
table
in

of
buffy
he
absently
sets
the
box
aside
buffy
looks
up
at
him
hopefully
he
leans
against
the
table
buffy
gives
in
and
starts
to
concentrate
on
the
crystal

a
small
stakeshaped
flaw
in
an
otherwise
nearly
clear
blue
crystal
faint
wind
chimes
can
be
heard
as
buffy
slowly
goes
into
a
trance
giles
leans
over
further
and
looks
into
her
face
satisfied
that
she
is
caught
in
the
crystal's
thrall
he
pulls
a
small
case
from
his
briefcase
sets
it
on

a
hypodermic

liquid
and
an

eye
on

takes
the
pad
and
leans
toward
her
he
takes
her
arm
pushes
up
her
sleeve
and
wipes
the
pad
on
a
spot
near
the
inside
of
her
elbow
he
fills
the
syringe
taps
it
to
get
any
air
bubbles
to
the
tip
and
pushes
on
the
plunger
until
the
fluid
begins
to
squirt
out
again
he
checks
to
be
sure
buffy
is
under
then
he
takes
her
arm
in
one
hand
and
with
the
other
sticks
in
the
needle
slowly
he
depresses
the
plunger
all
the
while
keeping
an
eye
on
his
charge
she
doesn't
stir
in
the
least
he
pulls
the
needle
back
out
buffy
does
not
bleed
from
the
site
quickly
he
puts
everything
away
buffy
remains
in
the
crystal's
thrall
giles
sits
on
the
table
trying
to
be
casual
and
waves
his
hand
between
buffy
and
the
crystal

comes
out

her
trance
and
looks
up
at

brings
the
ax
over
and
swings
it
at
the
metal
strap
where
it's
attached
to
the
crate
on
the
left
side
of
kralik's
head
then
on

right
the
strap
falls
to
the

steps
out

grunts
as

pulls
the
straightjacket
off

arm
and
lets
it
fall
he
goes
over
to
his
pill
bottle
and
pops
a
couple
into

takes
a
good
swallow
of

broadly
and
downs
the
rest
of

water
kralik
points
at
hobson's
room
the
boardinghouse
later
that
night
giles
opens
the
door
and
takes
a
tentative
look
inside
everything
seems
quiet
he
steps
in
and
closes
the
door
still
wary
of
the
place
he
goes
into
the
sitting
room
nothing
seems
amiss
he
walks
back
out
and
down
the
hall
looking
up
the
stairs
still
all
seems
well
but
it's
just
too
quiet
he
takes
a
few
steps
up
to
the
landing
he
notices
that
the
stair
railing
feels
clammy
and
looks
at
his
hand
it's
covered
with
fresh
blood
from
the
landing
he
looks
into
the
other
room
and
sees
the
closed
crate
standing
there
he
rushes
down
the
stairs
and
looks
for
a
weapon
he
grabs
one
of
the
stair
rail
supports
and
breaks
it
out
with
the
heel
of
his
other
hand
he
heads
straight
for
the
crate
intending
to
dust
whatever's
inside
but
finds
it
empty
alarmed
he
looks
around
and
then
down
at
the
floor
there
he
sees
tracks
of
blood
leading
into
the
kitchen
he
follows
them
ready
for
anything
holding
his
makeshift
stake
up
and
ready
he
grabs
the
doorknob
and
swings
it
open
but
nothing
is
there
to
meet
him
he
searches
for
the
light
switch
first
on
one
side
then
the
other
and
flips
it
on
when
he
finds
it
he
sees
what's
left
of
hobson
lying
on
the
table
the
camera
only
shows
his
arm
but
the
mauling
hobson
received
must
have
been
horrific
because
giles
immediately
drops
the
stake
backs
out
of
the
kitchen
puts
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
does
his
best
not
to
vomit
quickly
he
regains
his
composure
and
makes
tracks
out
of
the
house
man
to
the
other
man
to
buffy's
back
man
buffy
stops
cold
they
laugh
to
themselves
buffy
begins
to
turn
around
but
thinks
better
of
taking
them
on
in
her
weakened
state
she
continues
along
the
street
the
men
make
no
move
to
follow
her
buffy
wryly
she
rounds
a
corner
and
hears
humming
but
doesn't
see
anyone
around
she
stops
and
looks
behind
her
but
sees
no
one
there
either
she
starts
to
walk
again
as
she
turns
back
and
runs
right
into
kralik
he
holds
onto
her
by
the
arms
while
she
tries
to
pull
away
she
pulls
harder
and
he
yanks
her
back
kralik
playfully
she
starts
to
struggle
in
earnest
and
call
for
help
she
gets
her
left
arm
loose
pulls
her
right
arm

through

catches
up
and
grabs

get
around

but
he
just
keeps
going

looks
over
at
blair
who
couldn't
get
through

at

on
any
longer

is
distracted
by

pounding
on
the
door
she
runs
to
the
counter
and
rifles
through
the
drawers
looking
for
anything
she
can
use

finds
nothing

up

is
shallow
and
panting
with
fear

steps
back
to
the
door
and
quietly
opens

coast
is
clear
so
she
comes
into
the
hall

constantly
looks
around
as
she
makes
her
way
toward

almost
there

makes
a
dash
for
them
and
starts
to
run
up

punches
his
arm
through
the
railing
and
trips
her

fall
and

her
forehead
against

her
down

broken
piece

and
stabs
at

run
up

to
her
feet

down

opens
and
she
runs
in
slamming
the
door
behind
her
the
room
is
pitch
dark
buffy
searches
around
until
she
finds
a
string
hanging
from
the
ceiling
she
pulls
it
and
the
light
goes
on
she
stares
in
shock
at
the
walls
around
her
they
are
covered
with
polaroids
of
her
mother
she
grabs
one
off
the
wall
to
make
sure
just
then
she
hears

pounding
at
the
door

punches
through
and

knob
to

out
and
puts
his
hand
on

tries
to
push
him
away
but
he's
too
strong
and
bends
down
toward
her
neck
kralik
reassuringly
she
strains
hard
to
keep
him
at

has
one
of
his
attacks
he
grabs
his
head
and
begins
to
scream

tries
to
get
past
him

he
shoves
her
into
the
wall
stunning
her
he
pulls
out
his
pill
bottle
and
struggles
to
get
it
open

regains
her
head
and
grabs
the
bottle
out
of
his
hands
she
runs
down
the
hall
away
from
him
he
has
a
hard
time
coming
after
her
with
the
pain
in
his
head
buffy
reaches
the
far
end
of
the
hall
and
leaps
into
the
laundry
chute
kralik
looks
down
the
chute
and
hears
her
sliding
but
doesn't
follow
instead
he
staggers
back
the
other
way
buffy
gets
up
and
scrambles
over
to
her
mother

smashes

in
and
comes
running
down
the
stairs
demanding
his
pills
he
runs
into
the
room
and
buffy
fakes
trying
to
get
past
him
and
up
the
stairs
he
grabs
her
and
shoves
her
against
a
wall
he
sees
the
pill
bottle
in
her
hands
and
snatches
it
from
her
he
struggles
with
the
lid
as
he
stumbles
over
to
where
he
sees
a
glass
of
water
near
the
wine
racks
he
gets
the
lid
off
pops
a
couple
of
pills
and
gulps
down
the
water
he
gasps
for
air
and
takes
several
deep
breaths
as
he
begins
to
calm
down
knowing
that
the
medicine
should
soon
take
effect
he
smiles
evilly
over
at
buffy
and
takes
some
forced
steps
in
her
direction
buffy
just
watches
him
come
suddenly
he
realizes
something
is
very
wrong
and
stops
in
his
tracks
kralik
looks
down
at
the
glass
in

begins
to
shake
and
looks
back
up
at

pulls
the
nowempty
bottle
of
holy
water
from
her
pocket
and
holds
it
up
for
him
to

to
shake
violently
grunting
and
groaning
in
pain
smoke
begins
to
puff
out
of
his
clothes
buffy
watches
coolly
he
screams
loudly
one
final
time
and
then
crumbles
to
ashes
from
the
inside
out
buffy
closes
her
eyes
and
lets
out
a
sigh
of
relief
she
pockets
the
bottle
and
rushes
over
to
her
mother
she
pulls
the
gag
from
her
mouth
and
begins
to
work
on
the
ropes
