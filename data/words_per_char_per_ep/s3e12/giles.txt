this
one
used
for
charm
bags
money
spells
and
for
cleansing
one's
aura
buffy
i'm
aware
of
your
distaste
for
studying
vibratory
stones
but
since
it
is
part
of
your
training
i
would
appreciate
your
glibfree
attention
well
faith
is
not
interested
in
proper
training
so
i
must
rely
on
you
to
keep
up
with
yours
and
as
for
patrolling
well
you'll
be
there
soon
enough
why
so
anxious
well
in
due
time
but
uh
for
the
present
if
it's
not
entirely
beyond
your
capabilities
try
to
concentrate
bit
early
in
the
day
wrong
ah
perhaps
you
shouldn't
well
perhaps
you've
got
a
bad
flu
bug
or
something
well
just
um
take
it
easy
for
fortyeight
hours
you
know
forego
patrolling
until
you
feel
yourself
again
thank
you
yes
i
think
we
should
start
with
the
grounding
crystal
again
now
look
very
carefully
for
the
tiny
flaw
at
its
core
hmm
yes
but
buffy
i
think
we
should
concentrate
now
now
look
for
the
flaw
at
its
center
buffy
it's
best
to
take
care
of
that
perhaps
we
should
um
good
night
i'm
sure
it'll
sort
itself
out
a
girl
look
buffy
i
i
i
assure
you
um
given
time
wwwe'll
get
to
the
bottom
of
of
whatever's
causing
this
um
anomaly
yes
i
give
you
my
word
it's
an
archaic
exercise
in
cruelty
to
lock
her
in
this
if
any
one
of
the
council
still
had
actual
contact
with
a
slayer
they
would
see
but
i'm
the
one
in
the
thick
of
it
that's
not
true
or
she'll
be
dead
for
it
uh
no
not
yet
quentin
hello
quentin
hob
hurry
it's
an
organic
compound
of
muscle
relaxants
and
adrenal
suppressers
the
effect
is
temporary
you'll
be
yourself
again
in
a
few
days
it's
a
test
buffy
it's
given
to
the
slayer
once
she
uh
well
if
she
reaches
her
eighteenth
birthday
the
slayer
is
disabled
and
then
entrapped
with
a
vampire
foe
whom
she
must
defeat
in
order
to
pass
the
test
the
vampire
you
were
to
face
has
escaped
his
name
is
zackary
kralik
as
a
mortal
he
murdered
and
tortured
more
than
a
dozen
women
before
he
was
committed
to
an
asylum
for
the
criminally
insane
when
a
vamp
i
wanted
to
in
matters
of
tradition
and
protocol
i
must
answer
to
the
council
my
role
in
this
was
very
specific
i
was
to
administer
the
injections
and
to
direct
you
to
the
old
boardinghouse
on
prescott
lane
buffy
please
i
am
deeply
sorry
buffy
and
you
have
to
understand
you
have
to
listen
to
me
because
i've
told
you
this
the
test
is
invalidated
you
will
be
safe
now
i
promise
you
now
whatever
i
have
to
do
to
deal
with
kralik
and
to
win
back
your
trust
you
can't
walk
home
alone
buffy
it
isn't
safe
i
was
just
trying
to
reach
you
then
you
know
what's
happened
he's
killed
hobson
and
made
blair
one
of
his
own
your
perfectly
controlled
test
seems
to
have
spun
rather
impressively
out
of
control
don't
you
think
well
then
allow
me
i've
told
buffy
everything
yes
interestingly
i
don't
give
a
rat's
ass
about
the
council's
orders
there
will
be
no
test
why
this
is
not
business
you're
waging
a
war
she's
fighting
it
there
is
a
difference
the
test
is
done
we're
finished
on
what
grounds
i'm
not
going
anywhere
oh
we're
very
clear
