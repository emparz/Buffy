how
much
longer
hobson
once
you
finish
you
and
blair
can
get
some
rest
but
sleep
in
shifts
we're
getting
very
close
the
slayer's
preparation
is
nearly
complete
you're
having
doubts
cruciamentum
is
not
easy
for
slayer
or
watcher
but
it's
been
done
this
way
for
a
dozen
centuries
whenever
a
slayer
turns
eighteen
it's
a
timehonored
rite
of
passage
which
is
why
you're
not
qualified
to
make
this
decision
you're
too
close
a
slayer
is
not
just
physical
prowess
she
must
have
cunning
imagination
a
confidence
derived
from
selfreliance
and
believe
me
once
this
is
all
over
your
buffy
will
be
stronger
for
it
rupert
if
this
girl
is
everything
you
say
then
you've
nothing
to
worry
about
take
care
of
it
come
on
come
on
that's
enough
close
it
up
i
was
on
watch
over
by
the
boardinghouse
yes
it
changes
nothing
that
is
in
direct
opposition
to
the
council's
orders
the
test
has
already
begun
your
slayer
entered
the
field
of
play
about
ten
minutes
ago
i
don't
know
i
returned
there
just
as
she
entered
now
giles
we've
no
business
congratulations
you
passed
you
exhibited
extraordinary
courage
and
clearheadedness
in
battle
the
council
is
very
pleased
i
understand
that
you're
upset
you
think
the
test
was
unfair
we're
not
in
the
business
of
fair
miss
summers
we're
fighting
a
war
mr
giles
if
you
don't
mind
not
quite
she
passed
you
didn't
the
slayer
is
not
the
only
one
who
must
perform
in
this
situation
i've
recommended
to
the
council
and
they've
agreed
that
you
be
relieved
of
your
duties
as
watcher
immediately
you're
fired
your
affection
for
your
charge
has
rendered
you
incapable
of
clear
and
impartial
judgment
you
have
a
father's
love
for
the
child
and
that
is
useless
to
the
cause
it
would
be
best
if
you
had
no
further
contact
with
the
slayer
no
well
i
didn't
expect
you
would
adhere
to
that
however
if
you
interfere
with
the
new
watcher
or
countermand
his
authority
in
any
way
you
will
be
dealt
with
are
we
clear
congratulations
again
yes
well
colorful
girl
