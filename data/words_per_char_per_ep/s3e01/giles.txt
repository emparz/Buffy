so
no
joy
at
the
cemetery
for
god's
sake
be
careful
i
mean
uh
i
appreciate
your
efforts
to
keep
the
vampire
population
down
until
buffy
returns
but
uh



well
if
anything
should
happen
to
you
and



you
should
be
killed
i
should
take
it
somewhat
amiss
entirely
good
good
i
think
you're
going
to
love
that
one
yes
thank
you
thank
you

have
a
lead

friend
in
oakland

aaa
sketchy
report
of
a



young
girl
fending
off
a
group
of
vampires

believe
there's
a
meal
on
this
flight

mascara
listening
to
extremely
silly
music

the
most
capable
child

she
is
