that
really
never
works
are
you
guys
all
right
wasn't
andy
hoelich
on
the
gymnastics
team
uh
if
i
may
suggest
'this
time
it's
personal'
i
mean
there's
a
reason
why
it's
a
classic
tomorrow
right
big
day
i
guess
we
should
pack
it
in
well
actually
they're
kind
of
for
me
well
it's
sort
of
a
funny
story
you
remember
when
i
didn't
graduate
yeah
well
you
remember
when
i
didn't
go
well
actually
i
was
pretty
much
banking
on
you
finding
it
cute
so
the
cute
thing
is
out
well
i'd
be
willing
to
bargain
down
to
'eccentric'
with
an
option
on
'cool'
i
don't
know
i
think
we're
kinda
getting
a
rhythm
down
yeah
but



rhythmically
a
vampire
slayer
i
think
this
is
a
good
spot
is
everybody
packin'
let's
do
it
