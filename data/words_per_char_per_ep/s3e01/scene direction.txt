the
sunnydale
cemetery
at
night
the
camera
fades
in
on
a
gravestone
andrew
hoelich
19811998and
slowly
pans
down
to
the
ground
in
front
of
it
a
bouquet
of
fresh
flowers
is
there
a
hand
comes
out
of
the
freshly
filled
grave
and
claws
for
solid
ground
slowly
andrew
pulls
himself
out
of
his
grave
now
a
newly
made
vampire
he
growls
when
his
head
clears
the
earth
and
continues
to
climb
out
on
his
stomach
he
crawls
along
the
ground
pulling
out
his
legs
as
the
camera
pulls
back
and
stops
when
he
sees
a
pair
of
widespread
legs
standing
before
him
he
looks
up
to
see
who
it
is
willow
smiles
mischievously
andrew
suddenly
hops
to
his
feet
and
roars
at
her
taken
aback
by
this
willow
takes
a
few
quick
steps
backward
the
vampire
takes
two
steps
toward
her
xander
grabs
him
by
the
collar
of
his
suit
and
pulls
him
back
away
from
willow
andrew
loses
his
balance
in
the
process
oz
jumps
out
from
behind
a
bush
and
starts
to
run
toward
them
but
then
hesitates
a
moment
to
get
a
stake
from
his
jacket
pocket
andrew
has
regained
his
balance
and
using
xander's
grip
to
stabilize
himself
kicks
up
with
both
legs
and
does
a
double
pike
snapping
kick
to
oz's
face
oz
stumbles
backward
and
falls
without
pausing
andrew
leaps
up
again
and
does
a
back
tuck
over
xander's
head
xander
tries
to
rush
him
but
andrew
uses
his
momentum
to
deflect
him
into
willow
they
both
go
crashing
to
the
ground
willow
moans
but
quickly
sits
up
to
watch
andrew
run
away
oz
scrambles
to
his
feet
and
picks
up
his
stake
he
watches
the
demon
running
and
holds
his
stake
by
the
tip
preparing
to
throw
it
like
a
knife
andrew
leaps
over
a
rock
and
continues
running
oz
throws
the
stake
it
whistles
through
the
air
as
it
flies
end
over
end
and
hits
a
gravestone
bouncing
off
of
it
with
a
loud
thunk
and
flying
wild
oz
shaking
his
head
willow
and
xander
get
up
and
oz
turns
to
them
oz
looking
in
the
direction
that
andrew
went
xander
gestures
with
his
arm
xander
shouting
after
andrew
oz
gives
xander
a
brief
look
and
then
stares
into
the
distance
again
looking
for
andrew
xander
to

'come

goes
to

xander
pauses
willow
smiling
xander
puts
his
hands
on
his
hips
and
gives
her
a
look
they
all
start
to
walk
away
from
andrew's
grave
she
lowers
her
hand
to
take
his
again
at
her
waist
and
closes
her
eyes
she
embraces
his
arms
tightly
to
her
angel
whispering
into
her
ear
buffy's
expression
turns
from
contented
to
dismayed
the
camera
pans
away
from
the
window
past
the
sidewalk
and
into
the
street
a
police
siren
gets
louder
as
it
nears
and
an
instant
later
an
lapd
squad
car
races
across
the
intersection
at
the
end
of
the
block
against
the
red
light
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
behind
the
counter
at
a
small
sleazy
diner
named
helen's
kitchen
the
cook
puts
two
burgers
with
fries
up
on
the
pickup
counter
a
waitress
walks
past
the
counter
to
hang
an
order
on
the
spinner
buffy
walks
behind
her
to
pick
up
the
two
burgers
she
has
her
hair
in
two
short
braids
to
keep
it
out
of
the
way
her
expression
emotes
a
combination
of
sadness
and
boredom
she
takes
the
two
plates
walks
them
over
to
a
nearby
table
and
sets
them
down
in
front
of
two
roughneck
types
they
both
eye
her
lecherously
buffy
takes
out
her
order
pad
she
tears
off
their
bill
and
puts
it
on
the
table
the
other
roughneck
laughs
at
that
buffy
walks
away
and
as
she
goes
he
reaches
out
with
his
hand
and
slaps
her
on
the
behind
buffy
stops
in
her
tracks
the
two
men
just
chuckle
she
turns
her
head
slightly
but
thinks
better
of
doing
anything
about
it
she
walks
up
to
another
table
where
a
young
couple
is
sitting
they
are
too
into

to

out
their

buffy
looks
at
their

as
they
hold
them
out
together
and
sees
they

begin
to
pursue
the
girls

and
lily
run
through
a
maze
of
halls
and
come
out
on
a
ledge
that
overlooks
what
looks
like
a
large
iron
works
there
are
huge
vats
of
molten
metal
sparks
are
flying
through
the
air
from
one
side
and
it
is
hot
and
smoky
buffy
looks
closer
and
in
the
shadows
sees
people
being
used
as
slave
labor
kept
in
line
by
more
guards
with
whips
the
camera
pans
through
the
place
showing
zombielike
humans
pounding
the
metal
on
anvils
pushing
wheelbarrows
from
place
to
place
and
swinging
sledgehammers
some
of
them
cough
hard
as
they
work
the

watch
and
crack
their
whips
every
so
often

comes
up
behind

as
she
takes
in
the
scene

hits
buffy
hard
in
the
face
with
his
club
knocking
her
out

to

he
smiles
and
licks
his
lips
the
sunnydale
cemetery
cordelia
and

are
still
arguing
xander
raises
his
finger
at
her
and
is
about
to
respond
when
they
hear

get
tackled
to
the
ground
and
scream
their
attention
is
immediately
diverted
to
willow
and
they
begin
to
run
to
her
aid

is
quicker
and
beats
them
there
he
jumps
over

and
grabs
him
on

comes
at

with

and
they
begin
to
struggle
cordelia
watches

decides
to
join
the
fight
and
attacks
andrew
from
behind
pushing
him
and
xander
down
to
the
ground
they
end
up
with
andrew
sandwiched
between
xander
on
the
bottom
and
cordelia
on
the
top
with
cordelia's
weight
on
top
of
him
and
xander's
leverage
against
the
ground
andrew
can't
hold
back
the
stake
any
longer
and
it
plunges
into
his
chest
he
explodes
into
ashes
between
them
and
cordelia
falls
down
on
top
of
xander
the
two
of

look
at

and
muscle
and
