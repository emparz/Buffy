was
so
surprised
to

how
it
is
when
you
gotta
get

i
know
this
guy
he's
gonna
have
this
kinda
rave
thing
in
his
basement
we
could
go

i
could
show
you

'cause
i'm
broke
i
didn't
mean
to
bug
you
no
it's
okay
it's
okay
forget
about
it
just
a
homeless
man
rudely
pushes
his
way
between
them
the
two
girls
both
stare
after
him
that's
not
very
polite
are
you
okay

maybe
maybe
you
shouldn't
move
buffum
anne

i
talk
to
you
rickie's
gone
i
haven't
seen
him
for
more
than
a
day

happened
maybe
something's
happened
rickie
skipped
out
on
his
parole

they
would
just
cause
more
trouble

who
you
are
and
stuff
right
i
mean
you
help
people
and
you
know
buffy
i
can't
get
into
this
i'm
sorry
lily
you
you
know
how
to
do
stuff
but



i
don't
know
what
to
do
we
gave
blood
lots
of
times
'cause
you
get
a
few
bucks
and
they
have
cookies
it's
nice
rickie
t
we
come
in
sometimes
can
i
come
with
you

likes
to
go
to
this
movie
house

can
get
in
around
the
back
buffy
lily



i
think
he's
dead
but



he
takes
care
of
me
we're
gonna
get
a
place
his
cousin

get
him
a
job
at
the
car
wash
well
that's
not
rickie
do
you
mean
like
a
vampire
i
don't
understand
maybe
it's
not
rickie
okay
but
he
didn't
do
anything
wrong
why
would
this
happen
to
him
is
it
'cause
of
you
you
know
about



monsters
and
stuff
you
could
have
brought
this
with
you
you
can't
but
rickie



you've
seen
rickie

like
a
baptism
right

i
see
rickie
after
it
looks
kinda



dirty
what's
going
on

a
flash
of
light

tiles
itself
over
to
match
the
tiles
along
the
edges

now
appears
to
be
a
sixinch
deep
empty
ceremonial
pool
the
two
girls
just
stare
at
it
in
wonder
it's
really
nice
i'm

of
myself
