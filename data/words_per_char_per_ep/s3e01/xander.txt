the
uh
second
problem
i'm

i've
always
been
amazed
with

but



in
a
way
i
feel
like
we
took
her
punning
for
granted
oh
sorry
i
just
meant
we
in
the
past
took
it
for
granted
and
uh



we
won't
when
she
gets
back
i
can't
wait
to
see
cordelia
i
can't
believe
i
can't
wait
to
see
cordelia

she
can't
just
show
up

got
kicked
out
have
you
guys
seen
cordelia

don't
want
to

gonna
be
some
heat
if
you
know
what

depressing
night
willow
i

what
she's
doing
gabbing
to
all
of
her
friends
about
her
passionate
affair
with
pedro
the
cabana
boy
laughing
about
me
thinking
how
she
still
might
have
feelings
about
me

possible

were
talking
about
buffy
yeah
and
the
slaying
isn't
getting
any
easier

losing
half
the
vamps

to
bury
that
piece
of
the
past

down
the
runway
or
was
