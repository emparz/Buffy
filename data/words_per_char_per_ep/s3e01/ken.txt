hey
how
are
you
can
i
talk
to
you
for
a
moment
i
have
something
you
might
be
interested
in
whoa
oh



where
are
you
running
to
maybe
i
should
ask
where
are
you
running
from
you're
pretty
new
around
here
uh
you've
got
the
'look'
though
like
you
had
to
grow
up
way
too
fast
what's
your
name
hey
um
i'm
ken
here
go
ahead
take
one
of
these
don't
be
shy
about
stopping
by
i
mean
i
guess
you're
not
starving
but



we're
not
just
interested
in
feeding
the
body
you
might
find
something
you're
missing
then
why
are
you
here
this
is
not
a
good
place
for
a
kid
to
be
you
get
old
fast
here
the
thing
that
drains
the
life
out
of
them
is
despair
i
mean
kids
come
here
and
they
got
nothing
to
go
home
to
and



this
ends
up
being
the
last
stop
for
a
lot
of
them
shouldn't
have
to
be
that
way
are
you
okay
hey
it's
okay
maybe
i
can
help
look
i
know
you
all
think
i'm
a
big
square
handing
out
leaflets
about
hope
but
hope
is
a
real
thing
just
like
despair
and
hope
can
fill
up
a
part
of
you
that's
missing
rickie
say
are
you
lily
right
right
he
was
talking
about
you
oh
sure
rickie's
with
us
now
well
someone's
sure
handed
you
a
tall
tale
rickie's
no
more
dead
than
i
am
why
don't
you
come
to
family
home
we'll
get
you
taken
care
of
well
don't
you
look
nice
well
you
don't
want
to
wear
your
own
outfit
to
the
cleansing
not
quite
the
same
oh
of
course
he's
waiting
for
you
he's
very
excited
we
come
to
this
station
to
wash
away
the
past
go
ahead
kneel
we
let
the
water
run
over
the
sin
and
the
pain
and
the
uncertainty
yeah
this
is
a
private
moment
if
you
could
just
buffy
how
do
you
make
'em
old
ken
do
you
feed
on
youth
what's
the
deal
do
you
really
wanna
know
oh
my
face
ow
my
face
do
you
have
any
idea
how
hard
it
is
to
glue
that
thing
on
guards
welcome
to
my
world
i
hope
you
like
it
you're
never
leaving
isn't
it
what
is
hell
but
the
total
absence
of
hope
the
substance
the
tactile
proof
of
despair
you're
right
lily
this
is
where
you've
been
heading
all
your
life
just
like
rickie
he
forgot
you
well
it
took
him
a
long
time
he
remembered
your
name
years
after
he'd
forgotten
his
own
but
in
the
end
lily
years
but
ken
oh
uh
interesting
thing
time
moves
more
quickly
here
than
in
your
reality
a
hundred
long
years
will
pass
here
on
earth
it's
just
a
day
that's
the
plan
see
lily
you'll
die
of
old
age
before
anyone
wonders
where
you
went
not
that
anyone
will
that's
why
we
chose
you
no
but



i
know
you



anne
so
afraid
so
pathetically
determined
to
run
away
from
whatever
it
is
you
used
to
be
to
disappear
congratulations
you
got
your
wish
humans
don't
fight
back
humans
don't
fight
back
that's
how
this
works
get
down
there
one
of
you
fights



and
you
all
die
that



was
not



permitted
you've
got
guts
i
think
i'd
like
to
slice
you
open
and
play
with
them
let
everyone
know
this
is
the
price
of
rebellio
lily
pushes
him
from
behind
and
he
falls
screaming
from
the
high
ledge
to
the
floor
below
the
guards
holding
buffy
just
watch
as
he
hits
bottom
with
a
loud
thud
buffy
gives
lily
a
surprised
look
and
then
quickly
takes
advantage
of
the
distraction
and
backhand
punches
her
captors
one
in
the
face
and
the
other
in
the
groin
while
the
second
one
is
dazed
she
shoves
her
weight
against
him
and
he
falls
backward
onto
a
barrel
the
first
one
punches
high
but
she
blocks
grabs
his
arm
and
flips
him
over
onto
a
pile
of
burlap
sacks
buffy
jumps
up
onto
the
pile
and
steps
across
her
fallen
attacker
he
tries
to
grab
her
but
misses
she
jumps
high
into
the
air
and
grabs
hold
of
a
heavy
chain
hanging
from
above
she
climbs
it
handoverhand
as
quickly
as
she
can
to
the
ledge
where
lily
is
still
standing
the
two
of
them
run
through
the
door
and
quickly
find
their
way
to
the
others
struggling
with
a
heavy
iron
gate
you've
ruined



you
