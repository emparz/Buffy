okay
then
this
is
the
last
of
it
oh
do
shoes
count
as
clothes
oh
i
just
thought
i
was
saving
you
from
the
big
backtoschool
clothing
nightmare
she
did
yeah
she
was
um
you
know
great
she
was
just
i
don't
know
um
distant
not
brooding
or
sulking
just
there
was
no
connection
the
more
time
we
spent
together
the
more
i
felt
like
she
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
may
have
overcompensated
a
little
bit
it's
so
strange
you
know
at
least
when
she
was
burning
stuff
down
i
knew
what
to
say
