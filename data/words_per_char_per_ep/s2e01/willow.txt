okay
um
i
alright
okay
uh
'in
the
few
hours
that
we
had
together
we
loved
a
lifetime's
worth'
xander
terminator
good
great
oh
sorry
go
ahead
planet
of
the
apes
okay
good
me
uh
i'm
thinking
'use
the
force
luke'
xander
do
i
even
have
to
dignify
that
with
a
guess
i
couldn't
think
of
anything
it's
a
dumb
game
anyway
well
yes
if
you're
always
scissors
of
course
your
tendons
are
gonna
strain
yeah
but
on
the
plus
side
no
monsters
or
stuff
yeah
and
that
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
a
certain
girl
we
both
know
who
is
a
vampire
slayer
i
haven't
heard
from
her
i
got
a
couple
postcards
when
she
went
to
la
but
then
like
nothing
and
you
don't
care
uhhh
i
don't
wanna
know
xander
witness
my
nose
is
cold
xander
buffy
when'd
you
get
back
i
think
we
had
the
upper
hand
iin
a
subtle
way
yes
that's
right
you
missed
it
right
out
by
that
tree
giles
buried
the
bones
and
we
poured
holy
water
and
we
got
to
wear
robes
have
you
seen
giles
giles
hi
buffy
killed
a
vampire
last
night
sorry
we
better
get
to
class
what
were
you
thinking
about
xander
what'd
you
do
last
night
tsh
tell
me
about
it
the
other
night
i
dreamt
that
xander
uh
iit
wasn't
xander
iin
fact
it
wasn't
me
it
was
a
friend's
dream
and
she
doesn't
remember
it
angel
stopped
by
wow
was
there
well
i
mean
was
it
having
to
do
with
kissing
what
did
he
say
cibo
matto
they're
playing
cibo
matto
can
clog
dance
oh
sarcasm
right
the
three
musketeers
were
cool
uh
yes
our
own
personal
demons
you
haven't
been
talking
about
our
little
adventure
all
summer
have
you
a
little
too
good
i
just
think
something's
up
is
all
buffy's
never
acted
like
this
before
ever
since
she
got
back
she's
different
she's
never
been
mean
no
the
band's
cool
though
hi
what's
wrong
with
angel
she's
possessed
that's
the
only
explanation
that
makes
any
sense
i
mean
you
should've
seen
her
last
night
that
wasn't
buffy
aaaaa
possessing
thing
that's
what
it
was
i
mean
why
else
would
she
be
acting
like
such
a
bitch
what
would
somebody
want
with
master
bones
well
buffy
giles
did
bury
him
and
about
trout
what
do
we
do
what
do
you
mean
well
what
about
the
rest
of
the
note
the
part
that
says
'ps
this
is
a
trap'
stop
saying
that
god
what's
wrong
with
you
i
still
think
we
should've
gone
with
her
xander
you
know
it's
a
trap
it's
over
hey
buffy
we
saved
you
a
seat
well
i
hear
he
nods
off
a
lot
so
that's
a
plus
wednesday
it's
kinda
beat
there's
no
course
here
