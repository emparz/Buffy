very
intense

such
as
as
as
lust
and
uh
thrift
no
it's
see
we
can't
mention
that
stuff
in
front
of
other
people
buffy
being
the
slayer
and
all
now
that
was
a
good
insult
willow
you're
paranoid
buffy's
always
been
different
any
sign
of
her
she
said
she
was
coming
yeah
cool
you
got
somethin'
on
your
nose
hey
oookay

are
we
overlooking
the
idea
that
she
may
be
very
attracted
to
me
she's
possessed
well
you're
the
expert
hey
maybe
when
the
master
killed
her
some
mystical
bad
guy
transference
thing
happened
a
bitca
that's
a
very
interesting
point
about
trout
you
just
brought
up
now
a
trophy
a
horrible
conversation
piece
okay
that's
just
about
enough
well
is
there
anything
on
when
the
ceremony
might
take
whoa
i
don't
like
this
cordelia
may
be
dead
buffy's
about
to
lose
it
i
think
we
should
be
trying
to
reach
minimum
safe
distance
vampires
the
ones
you
could
handle
yourself
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
what
your
problem
is
what
your
issues
are
but
as
of
now
i
officially
don't
care
if
you'd
worked
with
us
for
five
seconds
you
coulda
stopped
this
if
they
hurt
willow
i'll
kill
you
giles
said
the
ritual
was
um
they
needed
people
who
were
close
to
the
master
physically
close
when
he
uh
giles
willow
cordelia
odds
are
they've
got
a
complete
set
by
now
how
buffy
buffy
we
gotta
do
something
now
what
are
you
gonna
do
uh
she's
working
out
her
issues
no
it's
not
there's
a
rumor
going
around
that
uh
mr
cox
is
the
most
boring
teacher
in
the
entire
world
like
i
think
he
won
a
belt
or
something
so
we
bronzin'
it
tonight
well
we
could
grind
our
enemies
into
talcum
powder
with
a
sledgehammer
but
gosh
we
did
that
last
night
hey
i
got
a
plan
how
'bout
miniature
golf

very
tiny
form
of
tennis
that
we
could
invent
