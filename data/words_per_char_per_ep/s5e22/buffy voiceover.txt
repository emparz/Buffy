summers
blood
it's
just
like
mine
dawn
listen
to
me
listen
i
love
you
i
will
always
love
you
but
this
is
the
work
that
i
have
to
do
tell
giles

tell
giles
i
figured
it
out
and
and
i'm
okay
and
give
my
love
to
my
friends
you
have
to
take
care
of
them
now
you
have
to
take
care
of
each
other
you
have
to
be
strong
dawn
the
hardest
thing
in
this
world

is
to
live
in
it
for
me
