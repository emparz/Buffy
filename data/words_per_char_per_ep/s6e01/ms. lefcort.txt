as
you
can
see
we've
provided
the
best
in
progressive
learning
but
we
can't
teach
your
children
unless
you
do
as
parents
you
have
a
responsibility
to
create
the
right
attitude
to
teach
your
child
what
school
can
mean
ms
summers
exactly
parents
let
kids
focus
on
school
as
a
social
experience
rather
than
a
learning
experience
we
want
you
to
get
your
kids
just
as
excited
about
education
as
they
are
about
the
lunch
hour
oh
