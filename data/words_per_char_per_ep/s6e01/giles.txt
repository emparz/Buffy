i'm
fine
i
just
need
to

to
die
for
a
minute
good
god
i
hope
he
doesn't
try
to
operate
heavy
machinery
spike
spike
you
might
have
let
me
in
on
your
plan
while
he
throttled
me
we
just
can't
have
her
messing
up
in
front
of
the
wrong
person
or
the
wrong
thing
we
we
need
the
the
world
and
the
underworld
to
believe
that
buffy
is
alive
and
well
and
she's
gone
anya
this
register
report
for
january
looks
a
bit
off
pull
the
files
again
mad
no
i'mi'm
i'm
sorry
if
you
resent
my
authority
but
i
won't
feel
comfortable
leaving
here
until
i
know
that
absolutely
everything
it's
not
inventory
it's
my
personal
collection
no
you
give
it
ow
ow
ow
i'm
not
leaving
the
store
to
anyone
i'm
going
to
england
i'm
not
dead
i'm
still
a
partner
that
was
splendid
now

try
it
again

only
this
time
remember
your
breathing
no
uh
that's
good
but
uh

think
of
the
breath
as
chi
air
as
a
a
life
source
of
course
strictly
speaking
but
i'm
testing
her
responses
after
her
injury
i
see
no
harm
in
imparting
a
little
eastern
philosophy
yes
well
i
appreciate
your
input
anya
but
i
think
buffybot
has
responded
nicely
to
our
sessions
no
perhaps
we
should
call
it
a
day
your

your
responses
are
fine
perhaps
anya's
right
perhaps
i
am
trying
to
teach
you
as
if
you
were
yes
i'm
not
so
sure
about
that
nothing
i
just
can't
help
but
wonder
if

she
would
have
been
better
off
without
me
buffy
right
yes
i
was
a
perfect
watcher
i
did
what
any
good
watcher
would
do
got
my
slayer
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
of
course
not
that's
how
all
slayerwatcher
relationships
end
isn't
it
she's
gone
i
did
my
job
i
was
trying
to
avoid
a
scene
really
not
you
me
thank
you
this
is
uh

impossible
really
yes
i
have
no
doubt
that's
me
just
yes
well
if
we're
going
to
do
this
let's
do
it
properly
i'm
just
a
phone
call
away

if
you
need
anything
you
must
promise
me
willow
i
don't
know
where
to
start
right
right
um
well
i
suppose
that's
the
question
really
just
uh

be
careful
please
