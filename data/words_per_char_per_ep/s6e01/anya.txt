it's
kind
of
intrusive
you
could
knock
first
or
something
xander
are
you
mad
at
me
well
then
why
are
you
torturing
me
you
know
i
used
to
punish
people
like
this
when
i
was
a
demon
i
made
them
doublecheck
spreadsheets
for
all
eternity
you're
taking
the
ramadan
effigy
oh
huh
aren't
you
mister
dicey
semantics
so
what
you
think
you
can
just
take
anything
you
want
give
it
silent
oversees
partner
i
know
i
know
it's
just

he
keeps
saying
he's
going
and
then
he
doesn't
and
i
keep
almost
being
in
charge
but
then
i'm
not
and
maybe
he
shouldn't
be
going
at
all
but
we
can't
talk
about
that
and
it
all
just
leaves
me
with
this
stress
and
bossiness
stored
up
and
it
just

leaks
out
i
was
being
patient
but
it
took
too
long
i
mean
ii
miss
buffy
i
do
but
life
shouldn't
just
stop
because
she's
gone
i'm
sick
of
waiting
to
take
over
here
and
i'm
sick
of
waiting
to
tell
everyone
about
us
why
not
it's
happy
news
happy
news
in
hard
times
is
a
good
thing
you've
been
saying
that
all
summer
fine
whatever
just
remember
that
this
whole
marriage
thing
was
your
stupid
idea
i
didn't
ask
to
be
all
crazy
yeah
it
wasn't
easy
i
went
through
every
supplier
the
magic
box
has
he's
too
busy
not
leaving
to
pay
attention
to
me
besides
i
ended
up
getting
it
on
ebay
yeah
from
this
desert
gnome
in
cairo
he
drove
a
really
hard
bargain
but
i
finally
got
him
to
throw
in
a
limited
edition
backstreet
boys
lunchbox
for
a

a
friend
are
you
sure
um
didiscovery
channel
has
monkeys
and
our
tape
machine's
all
wonky
you
did
and
then
you
said
let's
vote
and
it
was
unanimous
should
we
maybe
tell
giles
you
know
now
that
we're
really
ready
it's
not
like
he's
going
anywhere
ever
zombies
don't
eat
brains
anyway
unless
instructed
to
by
their
zombie
masters
a
lot
of
people
get
that
wrong
um

maybe
you
should
stick
to
the
standard
drill
you
know
you
don't
want
her
to
blow
another
gasket
well
i
just
think
that
the
concept
of
chi
might
be
a
little
you
know
hard
for
her
to
grasp
you
know
she's
not
the
descendant
of
a
long
line
of
mystical
warriors
she's
the
descendant
of
a
toaster
oven
well
you're
the
boss
still
well
it
must
be
something
pretty
intense
the
black
market's
all
baby
teeth
and
spooky
fluids
yyou
wanna
look
at
the
money
i
find
it
always
calms
me
um

well
it's
your
lucky
day
then
i
have
something
that
will
distract
you
um
we
uh
brought
you
some
lovely
parting
gifts
it's
american
get
it
apple
pie
to
remind
you
of
all
the
good
food
you
won't
be
eating
i'll
take
really
good
care
of
your
money
he'd
still
be
all
worried
just

eight
hours
ahead
maybe
we
should
have
told
him
i
mean
what
if
it
works
i'm
trying
my
lighter
won't
stay
lit
i
got
it
i
got
it
i
got
it
oh
god
what
is
that
noise
