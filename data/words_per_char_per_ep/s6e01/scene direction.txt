still
hear
the
motorcycles
all
around
pan
down
to
the
ground
into
blackness
fade
in
on
a
wrinkled
desiccated
hand
pan
up
across
a
body
encased
in
black
clothing
the
orange
mist
from
before
swirls
around
the
head
which
is
a
skull
with
much
of
the
skin
rotting
off
and
the
hair
decaying
as
the
mist
moves
around
the
body
the
eyeballs
reappear
the
skin
and
hair
repair
themselves
and
it
resolves
into
buffy
wideeyed
and
gasping
she's
inside
her
coffin
she
looks
around
panting
with
an
expression
of
extreme
fear
blackout
