the
timeliness

why
the
sudden
rushyrush

the
bot
blow
our
cover
at
school
and
they
still
thought
it
was
buffy

let's
apply
the
brakes
and
check
the
rear
and
sideview
mirrors

deep
stuff

talking
about

feels
wrong
excuse
me
who
made
you
the
boss
of
the
group
valid
points

but
we

i
mean
we
were
just
talking

scenario

we
raise
buffy
from
the
grave
she
tries
to
eat
our
brains

we
a
congratulate
ourselves
on
a
job
well
done
we
saw
her
body

you
can
dump
the
cryptic
okay

vino
de
madre
anyway
oh
we
were
it
just
felt
weird
hanging
out
on
our
own
i've
gone
not
one
for
long
goodbyes
i
thought
it
best
to
slip
out
quietly
love
to
you
all
giles
and
i
wanted
to
buy
you
a
can
of
old
english
800
'cause
you
know
england
and
you
and

because
at
the
time
it
sounded
really
funny
but
the
guy
who
lives
in
the
box
in
front
of
the
store
he
uh
wouldn't
buy
it
for
us
it's
a
good
thing
my
face
was
getting
sore
from
all
that
faux
smiling
can
you
believe
the
timing
i
mean
he's
leaving
right
when
we're
ready
to
do
the
thing
tonight

be
dark
soon
a
minute
till
midnight
