has
anybody
given
any
thought
to
what
this
green
stuff
is
i
think
it's
kale
or
possibly
string
cheese
so
buffy
how'd
the
slaying
go
last
night
i
mean
how'd
the
laying
go
no
i
don't
mean
that
either
well
hey
they're
bringing
in
the
muchneeded
tourist
dollars
ooo
look
at
mr
excitement
okay
what
just
happened
so
you
just
went
home
you're
acting
a
little
overly
aren't
you
i
mean
you
could
have
any
guy
in
school
sure
he's
got
a
certain
owenosity
but
that's
not
hard
to
find
i
mean
a
lotta
guys
read
i
can
read
oh
look
it's
owen
buffy
and
owen
and
xander
that'd
be
me
what
yeah
so
it
is
it
sure
is
so
uh
y'know
owen
is
a
little
home
spun
he
probably
doesn't
like
that
overly
assertive
look
oh
hey
here's
something
a
nice
comfy
overcoat
and
a
ski
cap
the
ear
flaps
will
bring
out
your
eyes
oh
you
mean
for
kissing
you
and
then
telling
all
his
friends
how
easy
you
are
so
the
whole
school
loses
respect
for
you
and
then
talks
behind
your
back
the
red's
fine
you're
not
bothering
me
yeah
a
couple
of
things
about
tonight
well
it's
a
little
too
late
to
do
anything
about
that
uh
you
should
probably
know
that
buffy
doesn't
like
to
be
kissed
actually
she
doesn't
like
to
be
touched
as
a
matter
of
fact
don't
even
look
at
her
i
wish
it
was
just
bad
yeah
you're
right
i
don't
trust
that
owen
guy
it's
the
eyes
crazy
oh
he's
gone
uh
it's
he's
gonna
be
alright
he's
like
super
librarian
y'know
everyone
forgets
willow
that
knowledge
is
the
ultimate
weapon
we
saw
two
guys
going
in
after
you
are
they
look
i
hate
to
state
the
obvious
but
this
looks
like
a
job
for
buffy
look
we'll
get
her
just
uh
hang
in
there
you
don't
know
the
half
of
it
what's
he
doing
here
look
we
gotta
get
to
uh
uhhhh
we
thought
it'd
be
fun
if
uh
we
made
this
a
double
date
'cause
of
the
fun
hey
maybe
we
should
all
go
somewhere
together
you
know
what'd
be
cool
the
sunnydale
funeral
home
we
saw
some
guys
in
there
before
they
seemed
to
be
good
thinking
and
we'll
be
leaving
gimme
that
he's
in
there
she'll
be
okay
c'mon
jjust
give
her
a
sec
we'll
make
sure
he
gets
home
safely
well
in
that
case
no
no
no
see
what
you
need
is
a
guy
who
already
knows
your
deepest
darkest
secrets
and
still
says
'hey
i
like
that
girl'
someone
like
