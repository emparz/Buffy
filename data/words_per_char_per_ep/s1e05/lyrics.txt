is
real

then
you
wake
up
shouting
some
familiar
name

it's
not
the
same
you're
just
a
girl

just
a
girl
who
knows
no
shame

whose
desperate
pace
has
lost
its
taste

a
neverending
darkness
weighs

i
can't
avoid
i
can't
complain

i
know
exactly
who's
to
blame

the
girl
who
shares
my
i'll
be
right
along

'cause
baby
you're
so
strong
baby
baby
i
know
it's
always
been
so

physical
love
is
oh
so
meaningful
for
you
so
strong

baby
i'm
yours

you
know

because
you're
so

so
strong
you're
so
so
strong
you
would
suffer
suffer
for
me
i
have
a
window
in
my
mind

i
can
turn
to
look
right
through
you
won't
cost
you
anything
but
time

to
see
me
feel
like
you
do
the
world
will
keep
on
turning

it'll
all
be
there
come
morning

so
tonight
let
the
sun
fall
down
all
around
you
