back
of
the
box
well
in
that
case
i
won't
wear
my
button
that
says
'i'm
the
slayer
ask

i
was
sitting
in
a
cemetery
with
the
librarian
waiting
for
a
vampire
to
rise
so
i
could
prevent
an
evil
prophecy
from
coming
to
pass'
xander
or
flat
tire
i
can't
take
this
anymore
i
feel
like
everyone
is
staring
at
me
the
big
hideous
dateless
monster
what
yeah
that's
right
i
have
no
life
c'mon
nothin'
to

of
you

sort
of
owen
and
i
the

'i

i'll
tell
you
what
i'll
be

little
while

uh
you
remember
when
you
said
i
was
like
two
different
people

one
of
them
has
to
go
but
the
other
one
is
having
a
really
really
good
time
and
will
come
back
i
promise
which
way
damn
it
uh
owen
you
can't
be

possibly
several
guys
watch
him
giles
giles
what
happened
meaning
well
wwere
they
here
after
you
or
wwas
it
that
prophecy
thing
but
he
may
not
be
okay
i
just
need
to
get
owen
and
the
others
out
of
harm's
way
first
i
didn't
bring
him
he
came
i
know
i'll
get
rid
of
him
no
no
giles
he
sees
you
he's
gonna
have
more
questions
than
he
already
does
right
now
i'll
take
care
of
it
it
is
no
he's
right
so
let's
find
a
nice
safe
fun
room
to
look
around
in
no
it's
not
that's
the
plan
i
have
to
go
now
um
to
the
bathroom
i
have
to
go
to
the
bathroom
if
you
hear
anything
like
a
security
guard
or
something
just
be
really
quiet
and
barricade
the
door
ewww
parts
nothing
i
guess
i
mean
this
is
where
they
keep
all
the
dead
bodies
right
oh
no
uh
go
get
out
what've
you
got
what'd
you
bring
do
you
have
a
stake
thank
you
um
go
outside
and
make
sure
the
others
are
okay
no
you
killed
my
date
you
killed
my
date
owen
oh
we
scared
him
away
i
know
here
i'm
sure
this
isn't
exactly
what
you
had
in
mind
for
our
first
date
we
still
could
i'll
get
you
there
don't
well
did
owen
say
anything
about
me
on
the
way
home
or
generally
iin
the
area
in
the
ballpark
any
sort
of
indication
you
think
i
knew
it
i
totally
blew
it
last
night
owen
hi
this
is
going
well
you
don't
even
have
to
i'm
sure
you
were
pretty
freaked
out
um
that
was
my
hopeful
ear
could
you
repeat
that
really
so
that's
why
you
wanna
be
with
me
something
like
tonight
would
be
not
a
workable
thing
did
i
just
say
that
i'm
not
please
don't
take
this
personally
it's
not
you
it's
me
and
i
was
kinda
hoping
that
maybe
you
and
i
could
still
be
that'd
be
nice
yeah
great
were
you
thrilled
beyond
all
measure
sacrifice
huh
yeah
but
he
wants
to
be
danger
man
you
xander
willow
you
guys
you
guys
know
the
score
you're
careful
two
days
in
my
world
and
owen
really
would
get
himself
killed
or
i'd
get
him
killed
or
someone
else
and
i
should've
been
there
i
blew
it
well
at
least
i
did
stop
that
prophecy
thing
from
coming
true
