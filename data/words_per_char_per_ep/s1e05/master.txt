'and
there
will
be
a
time
of
crisis
of
worlds
hanging
in
the
balance
and
in
this
time
shall
come
the
anointed
the
master's
great
warrior
and
the
slayer
will
not
know
him
will
not
stop
him
and
he
will
lead
her
into
hell'
as
it
is
written
so
shall
it
be
'five
will
die
and
from
their
ashes
the
anointed
shall
rise
the
brethren
of
aurelius
shall
greet
him
and
usher
him
to
his
immortal
destiny'
as
it
is
written
so
shall
it
be
'and
one
of
the
brethren
shall
go
out
hunting
the
night
before
and
get
himself
killed
because
he
couldn't
wait
to
finish
his
job
before
he
ate'
oh
wait
that's
not
written
anywhere
the
anointed
will
be
my
greatest
weapon
against
the
slayer
if
you
fail
to
bring
him
to
me
if
you
allow
that
girl
to
stop
you
here
endeth
the
lesson
you
have
done
well
everything
is
in
place
when
this
night's
work
is
done
i
will
have
a
mighty
ally
i'll
be
one
step
closer
to
freeing
myself
from
this
mystical
prison
i've
been
trapped
down
here
so
long
i've
nearly
forgotten
what
it's
like
on
the
surface
well
there'll
be
time
enough
to
remember
when
i
rule
it
if
she
tries
to
stop
you
kill
her
give
your
own
lives
but
do
not
fail
to
bring
the
anointed
i
know
you
won't
disappoint
me
bug
'and
in
this
time
will
come
the
anointed
and
the
slayer
will
not
know
him
she
will
not
stop
him
and
he
will
lead
her
into
hell'
welcome
my
friend
