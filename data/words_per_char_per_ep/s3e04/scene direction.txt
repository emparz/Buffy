night
in
a
wood
near

the
full
moon
rises
slowly
above
the
trees
cut
into
the
wood
the
camera
moves
among
the
trees
and
bushes
low
to
the
ground
in
slow
motion
buffy
reads
from
'call
of
the
wild'
in
a
voiceover
she
flips
through
the
pages
of
the
book
while
oz
growls
at
her
and
settles
back
down
in
the
cage
xander
walks
into
the
library
carrying
a
thermos
and
a
couple
of
magazines
looking
very

looks
up
from

yawns
as

walks
up
to

and
takes
the
book
out
of
her
hands
willow
takes
back
the
book
willow
looks
at
oz
she
takes

and
leads
him
away
from

toward
the
table
as
the
camera
pulls
back
with
them
the
towels
draped
across
most
of
the
cage
come
into
view
willow
quietly
willow
whispers
oz
hears
that
and
he
jumps
against

banging
it
loudly

and

both
jump
and
look
back
at

with

of
nervous
gesturing

realizes
willow
with
a
big
smile
willow
reaches
across
the
table
she
holds
up
the
dart
rifle
xander
takes
it
from
her
with
his
right
hand
while

holding
his
things
with
his
left
and
slips
his
index
finger
into

guard
he
holds
the
stock
of
the
weapon
against

shoulder
xander
looks
at

things

points
with
the
gun
xander
chuckles
willow
isn't
thrilled
with
the
way
he's
handling
the
rifle
and
so
takes
it
out
of
his
hand
giving
him
a
nervous
smile
she
sets
it
down
on
the
table
gives
him
a
little
wave
goodbye
and
starts
out
on
the
way
past

wave
too

easy
on
himself
he
climbs
onto

the
book
down
at

lies
on

willow
upset
giles
and
oz
both
go
over
to

willow
gives

a
betrayed
look

looks
down
from

your
eyes
for
glares
at
him
oz
just
stares
into
space
turning
the
implications
over
in
his
mind
xander
searches
for
words
giles
angrily
oz
walks
over
to
willow
looking
at
her
sadly
she
takes
his
hand
to
comfort
him
he
looks
at
giles
imploringly
he
makes
no
move
to
turn
around
to
face
her
buffy
smiles
her
smiles
fades
when
she
realizes
he
still
isn't
going
to
turn
around
instead
he
just
blows
out
a
huge
cloud
of
cigarette
smoke
mr
platt
finally
turns
mr
platt
smiles
at
her
mr
platt
waves
his
hand
at
her
mr
platt
takes
another
drag
from
his
cigarette
mr

crushes
it
out
reaches
into
his
desk
drawer
that's
not
what
you
need
right
now
pulls
out
a
can
of
deodorizer
what
you
need
is
a
trained
not
too
crazy
professional
who
will
always
give
you
his
honest
opinion
he
pops
the
top
off
of
the
aerosol
can
and
gives
a
couple
of
sprays
around
himself
buffy
just
gives
him
an
odd
look
and
says
nothing
he
looks
back
at
her
for
a
moment
before
gesturing
to
a
chair
he
caps
the
can
and
puts
it
away
as
she
sits
in
the
chair
he
stands
up
and
starts
to
walk
around
his
desk
mr
platt
sits
on
his
desk
buffy
averts
her
eyes
buffy
looks
down
at
her
hands
mr
platt
buffy
looks
up
at
him
in
surprise
mr
platt
crosses
his
arms
she
looks
up
for
a
moment
then
begins
to
fidget
and
lean
back
in
her
seat
buffy
smiles
weakly
mr
platt
shrugs
mr
platt
gestures
widely
with
his
arms
mr
platt
inhales
and
leans
back
buffy
awkwardly
she
looks
up
at
him
for
a
long
moment
before
letting
out
a
breath
and
looking
down
at
her
hands
again
she
looks
up
at
him
surprised
again
buffy
doesn't
know
what
to
add
or
how
to
respond
buffy
considers
mr
platt
inhales
she
didn't
expect
to
hear
it
put
quite
that
way
buffy
crosses
her
arms
willow
glares
xander
annoyed
xander
cordelia
rolls
her
eyes
xander
buffy
looks
at
giles
inquiringly
is
it
oz's
fault
that
oz
lowers
his
head
you
know
side
effect
people
get
cut
to
ribbons
and
maybe
then
he'll
take
a
little
nibble
and
willow
gives
him
a
hurt
look
i'm
not
helping
am
i
giles
thinks
uh
the
others
um
check
out
the
morgue
willow
hopeful
willow
glances
at
oz
next
to
her
buffy
nods
and
looks
at
oz
oz
looks
up
at
giles
he
gets
up
to
leave
not
willing
to
listen
to
any
more
of
this
willow
gives
buffy
a
concerned
look
and
gets
up
to
go
after
him
she
reaches
out
and
touches
him
on
the
shoulder
he
stops
and
turns
to
face
her
she
tries
to
give
him
a
reassuring
smile
oz
inhales
oz
exhales
she
glances
and
gestures
at
the
clock
on
the
wall
and
sighs
oz
looks
over
at
it
too
5
34pm
almost
sunset
he
looks
back
at
her
and
the
others
realizing
this
isn't
the
time
to
do
the
guy
thing
and
lets
out
a
heavy
sigh
he
looks
over
at
the
cage
and
reluctantly
goes
to
lock
himself
up
willow
follows
him
the
door
squeaks
when
he
pulls
it
open
and
again
as
he
pulls
it
closed
it
locks
shut
with
a
clang
oz
unwilling
to
look
at
her
willow
confused
by
his
tone
of
voice
oz
still
not
looking
at
her
willow
still
won't
go
he
turns
his
back
to
her
willow
is
hurt
and
confused
by
his
behavior
again
a
figure
dashes
by
and
this
time
buffy
sees
it
she
runs
after
it
through
the
bushes
suddenly
she
stops
in
her
tracks
when
she
sees
it
come
straight
for
her
she
stares
in
disbelief
as
the
man
rushes
her
and
knocks
her
down
as
he
runs
by
buffy
steadies
herself
on
the
ground
and
looks
up
as
he
goes
he
stops
and
looks
back
at
her
it's
angel
and
he
growls
and
snarls
at
her
there
is
blood
around
his
mouth
but
he
has
on
his
human
face
not
his
vampire's
she
can
only
stare
at
him
in
complete
surprise
in
the
woods
angel
continues
to
growl
at
buffy
he
charges
her
as
she
gets
up
she
grabs
him
and
throws
him
to
the
ground
but
also
falls
under
his
weight
angel
rolls
to
a
stop
and
crawls
quickly
back
to
her
before
she
can
get
back
up
he
lunges
at
her
and
she
uses
his
momentum
to
flip
him
over
herself
and
onto
his
back
she
rises
to
one
knee
and
punches
him
as
he
tries
to
regain
his
footing
he
takes
the
blow
in
the
head
but
just
spins
around
and
delivers
a
solid
backhand
punch
to
her
face
making
her
fall
onto
her
back
angel
jumps
on
her
again
but
she
uses
her
leverage
to
send
him
onto
his
back
once
again
he
twists
his
body
reaches
over
and
punches
her
in
the
gut
she
quickly
rolls
away
and
gets
to
a
standing
position
she
does
a
full
spinning
low
hook
kick
hitting
him
in
the
head
as
he
tries
to
stand
he
slumps
down
on
all
fours
and
as
he
looks
up
at
her
she
punches
him
solidly
in
the
face
making
him
slump
to
the
ground
badly
beaten
after
a
few
breaths
he
loses
consciousness
and
his
body
relaxes
buffy
breathes
hard
as
she
looks
down
at
him
still
not
believing
what
she
sees
he
bends
over
holding
his
mouth
trying
to
hold
it
back
willow
just
hands
him
the
flashlight
he
doesn't
hold
it
very
steadily
and
willow
tries
to
adjust
his
arm
as
she
would
an
unruly
desk
lamp
she
takes
jeff's
hand
and
tries
to
get
a
look
at
his
fingers
suddenly
xander
spins
around
and
shines
the
flashlight
into
cordelia's
face
willow
just
reaches
for
xander's
hand
again
and
pulls
it
around
to
shine
the
light
where
she
needs
it
it's
not
working
out
very
well
xander
to
cordelia
he
finally
gives
willow
his
attention
again
and
holds
the
light
steady
cordelia
gets
a
look
at
jeff's
mauled
body
cordelia
covers
her
face
willow
just
calmly
goes
about
getting
some
samples
from
under
jeff's
fingernails
she's
finished
with
jeff's
hand
and
puts
it
back
under
the
plastic
she
moves
the
flashlight
in
xander's
hand
around
and
inspects
the
rest
of
the
body
xander
interrupts
willow
starts
to
pick
at
jeff's
chest
with
the
tweezers
cordelia
stares
taken
aback
they
could
be
from
the
attacker
cordelia
holds
her
nose
against
the
stench
she
drops
the
tweezers
and
faints
dead
away
falling
back
into
xander
he
quickly
gets
an
arm
under
her
as
she
goes
down
and
they
all
sink
to
the
floor
he
steadies
willow's
head
against
his
chest
so
it
doesn't
flop
around
cordelia
they
look
up
at
jeff
back
in
the
main
room
she
throws
one
end
over
an
iron
bracket
holding
up
the
high
marble
fireplace
mantel
and
locks
the
shackles
on
angel's
wrists
she
steps
back
as
he
lies
unconscious
on
the
floor
with
one
arm
held
high
by
the
chain
he
wakes
up
and
gets
to
his
knees
suddenly
he
lashes
out
at
her
but
she
jumps
back
in
time
and
he
misses
he
leans
against
his
bonds
and
growls
at
buffy
then
crouches
down
and
cowers
like
a
trapped
animal
she
walks
around
him
in
a
wide
arc
and
stops
when
she
notices
the
place
where
he
fell
from
the
dimensional
portal
there
is
a
silhouette
of
him
on
the
floor
surrounded
by
scorch
marks
from
the
intense
light
angel
continues
to
growl
and
struggle
with
the
chain
buffy
cringes
to
see
him
like
this
she
kneels
down
by
the
silhouette
for
a
closer
look
angel
makes
another
attempt
to
grab
her
and
she
jerks
back
but
he's
too
far
away
to
do
any
harm
she
looks
back
down
at
the
scorch
marks
and
winces
at
the
sound
of
angel
struggling
behind
her
he
soon
stops
and
slumps
to
the
floor
with
one
arm
raised
high
by
the
chain
instinctively
faith
spins
around
and
lands
a
swinging
backhand
punch
to
buffy's
face
she
stumbles
backward
and
steadies
herself
against
the
portable
card
catalog
buffy
holds
her
jaw
faith
shrugs
with
the
cd
player
buffy
takes
a
breath
and
arches
her
back
buffy
shrugs
buffy
takes
off
her
jacket
she
heads
for
the
door
handing
buffy
the
keys
to
the
cage
on
the
way
buffy
follows
her
with
her
gaze
the
door
can
be
heard
closing
behind
her
buffy
looks
at
oz
for
a
moment
then
turns
her
attention
to
the
card
catalog
she
sets
the
keys
on
it
pulls
out
the
first
drawer
and
begins
to
search
through
them
giles
sips
his
coffee
buffy
quickly
realizes
what
it
must
look
like
her
surrounded
by
all
these
books
and
tries
to
play
it
off
buffy
stands
up
giles
reads
some
book
titles
buffy
walks
toward
the
stairs
she
realizes
that
he
hasn't
bought
it
and
leans
against
the
railing
he
gives
her
his
attention
and
slowly
comes
over
to
her
as
she
speaks
giles
sips
his
coffee
she
sits
down
on
the
steps
giles
comes
down
to
sit
with
her
giles
sets
the
cup
aside
she
stops
when
she
realizes
her
use
of
jenny's
metaphor
giles
takes
off
his
glasses
and
considers
for
a
moment
buffy
inhales
deeply
giles
looks
away
in
thought
giles
looks
up
at
her
giles
swallows
hard
buffy
hopelessly
willow
shows
up
unexpectedly
bringing
a
box
of
donuts
with
her
buffy
comes
down
to
her
willow
smiles
willow
gestures
willow
sighs
behind
her
oz
has
dressed
and
comes
out
of
the
cage
she
notices
buffy
look
behind
her
with
wide
eyes
oz
slips
on
his
outer
shirt
and
comes
up
next
to
her
willow
offers
the
box
oz
ignores
the
donuts
willow
smiles
avoiding
the
issue
willow
sets
the
box
down
on
the
table
her
expression
shows
that
she's
not
overly
anxious
to
say
buffy
looks
back
at
him
she
realizes
the
sensitivity
of
the
issue
with
oz
standing
right
there
she
sits
down
giles
just
calmly
waits
for
willow
to
finish
her
report
she
comes
over
to
him
sitting
with
debbie
and
pete
and
sets
down
her
plate
scott
sees
what's
on
her
plate
buffy
points
at
the
green
jello
scott
whispers
buffy
looks
at
it
debbie
and
pete
give
her
curious
looks
buffy
sighs
debbie
giggles
debbie
can't
resist
a
giggle
scott
to
buffy
buffy
gives
him
a
weak
smile
he
turns
to
face
her
completely
buffy
smiles
buffy
stands
up
she
pats
him
on
the
shoulder
as
she
walks
around
him
on
the
way
out
leaving
her
jello
behind
debbie
and
pete
follow
her
briefly
with
their
gazes
scott
isn't
too
pleased
with
that
comment
buffy
stops
at
the
wall
opposite
him
and
looks
at
him
suffering
slowly
she
comes
toward
him
angel
just
remains
hunched
over
in
his
crouch
not
looking
up
or
giving
any
indication
that
he
knows
she's
there
he
doesn't
seem
to
hear
her
still
nothing
from
him
she
comes
even
closer
the
tattoo
on
his
back
beckons
to
her
slowly
she
reaches
out
and
touches
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
he
suddenly
and
very
violently
lashes
out
at
her
and
roars
she
instantly
takes
several
steps
backward
away
from
him
he
goes
back
to
his
pathetic
whimpering
buffy
looks
at
him
terribly
hurt
and
rushes
from
the
mansion
angel
growls
deeply
at
her
above
him
the
mantel
bracket
begins
to
loosen
dust
falls
from
the
stone
as
he
pulls
against
the
chain
he
