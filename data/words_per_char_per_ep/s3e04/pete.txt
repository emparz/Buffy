that
did
you
debbie
what's
going
on
so
the
bottle
just
jumped
out
of
the
cabinet
and
spilled
on
its
own
you
were
trying
to
get
rid
of
it
you
think
this
has
anything
to
do
with
how
i
get
when
i
drink
it
nothing
debbie
nothing
i
don't
need
this
anymore
okay
i
am
way
way
past
that
now
you
see
you
see
no
more
you
could
pour
out
everything
i
made
and
it
wouldn't
help
and
you
wanna
know
why
you
wanna
know
why
because
all
it
takes
now
is
you
debbie
you
and
your
stupid
grating
voice
you're
the
reason
i
started
the
formulas
in
the
first
place
to
be
the
man
you
wanted
and
you
pay
me
back
how
by
whoring
around
with
other
guys
and
taunting
me
is
that
something
your
shrink
taught
you
debbie
huh
huh
to
share
to
communicate
to
piss
me
off
well
guess
what
even
he's
not
going
to
listen
to
your
pathetic
ramblings
anymore
i'm
all
you've
got
now
debbie
do
you
hear
me
i
am
all
you've
got
oh
my
god
hey
debbie
hey
listen
you
know
you
shouldn't
make
me
mad
huh
you
know
what
happens
debbie
please
are
you
all
right
since
when
do
you
touch
my
girl
well
i
guess
you
didn't
think
about
that
when
you
put
the
moves
on
debbie
you
won't
be
alive
to
see
it
did
you
kiss
that
whore
huh
did
she
like
it
how
did
she
know
debbie
did
you
run
your
big
mouth
so
you
filled
in
the
blanks
but
what
did
i
expect
from
a
screwup
like
you
you're
nothing
but
a
waste
of
space
all
the
same
you're
all
the
same
