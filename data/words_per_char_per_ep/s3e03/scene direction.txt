under
him

looks
over
at

who
is
whaling
away
on
her
vampire
with

grabs
her
by

for
an
instant
then
continues
desperately
clawing
for
the

pays
her
no

and
just
keeps
punching
her
vampire
to
a
pulp
the
alley

keeps
reaching
for
the
twobyfour
faith
continues
her
pounding
buffy
finally
manages
to

board
and
she
swings
it
up
and
beans
one
of
the
vampires
in
the
face
with
it
and
turning
to
the
other
push
kicks
him
off
of
her
she
quickly
gets
to
her
feet
and
looks
over
at
faith
the
one
she
kicked
off
makes
a
grab
at
her
from
behind
and
she
instinctively
turns
and
jams
the
makeshift
stake
home
the
vampire
crumbles
to

and
drops
the
box

with
an
echoing
clinking

backward
and
over
a

walks
into
the
building
his
oneeyed
gaze
fixed
on

buffy
rolls
to
a
stand
on
the
table

picks
up
a
crowbar
and
swings
it
baseball
style
at

another
vampire
advancing
towards

her
attention
buffy
throws
her
the
crowbar
faith
catches
the
crowbar
in
midair
but
before
she
can
swing
it
at
kakistos
he
punches
her
hard
and
knocks
her
into
a
bunch
of
large
wooden
beams
leaning
against
the
wall
she
hits
the
floor
as
the
beams
go
tumbling

nodding
his
head
and
observing

and
throws
him
into
an
assisted
front
tuck
off
of
the
table
kakistos
calmly
steps
up
to
faith
as
she
scrambles
up
against
the
wall
cowering
he
reaches
down
and
grabs
her
by
the
shirt
picking
her
up
off
of
the
floor
once
he
has
her
up
he
punches
her
squarely
in
the
face
buffy
is
no
longer
on
the
table
and
she
roundhouse
kicks
over
it
knocking
the
legs
out
from
under
a
vampire
standing
on
it
he
rolls
off
of
the
table
and
onto
his
back
and
buffy
stakes
him
cleanly
she
looks
up
at
faith
being
whaled
on
by
kakistos
behind
her
the
unconscious
vampire
wakes
kakistos
finally
hits
faith
hard
enough
to
knock
her
from
his
own
grip
onto
the
floor
he
roars
loudly
buffy
jumps
up
and
runs
over
to
attack
him
she
roundhouse
kicks
him
in
the
back
of
the
knee

around
and
tries
to
backhand
him
in
the
face
but
he
blocks
it
she
spins
around
the
other
way
and
backhands
him
in
the
face
the
now
wakened
vampire
gets
back
up
from
the
floor
and
trick
comes
up
behind
her
he
considers
that
for
a
moment
and
decides
that
wouldn't
be
such
a
bad
thing
he
and
the
vampire
turn
to
leave
buffy
tries
to
stake
kakistos
but
the
stake
can't
easily
penetrate
his
thick
hide
and
so
has
no
effect
on
him
he
grabs
buffy
by
the
hair
lifts
her
and
throws
her
back
trick
and
the
vampire
calmly
continue
on
their
way
out
buffy
backhands
kakistos
landing
a
hard
punch
he
swings
at
her
but
she
ducks
she
stands
up
and
tries
to
stake
him
again
but
even
though
the
stake
goes
in
deeper
this
time
it
still
has
no
effect
on
him
again
he
grabs
her
by
the
head
and
shoves
her
back
into
the
wall
faith
recovers
from
her
daze
and
sees
him
looming
before
her
but
looking
at
buffy
instead
of
at
her
kakistos
laughs
maniacally
faith
sees
that
one
of
the
fallen
beams
has
a
broken
end
she
lifts
it
up
over
her
shoulder
and
before
kakistos
can
turn
his
attention
back
onto
her
she
thrusts
the
beam
through
his
chest
and
out
his
back
he
looks
down
at
it
and
back
up
at
faith
and
then
explodes
into
ashes
buffy
stares
in
amazement
faith
heaves
a
few
heavy
breaths
buffy
pulls
the
hair
back
from
her
face
and
steps
over
to
faith
who
looks
around
to
make
sure
nothing
else
is
about
to
attack
they
both
look
down
at
the
pile
of
ash
left
by
kakistos
they
both
head
out
of
the
building
giles
walks
around
the
table
giles
picks
up
some
papers
buffy
is
sitting
on
the
table
and
willow
is
sitting
in
a
chair
buffy
slides
off
of
the
table
giles
looks
over
the
papers
buffy
looks
down
at
the
table
sadly
and
quietly
for
a
long
moment
giles
looks
up
buffy
to
willow
buffy
willow
looks
up
taking
it
all
in
she
looks
down
at
the
table
again
for
another
long
moment
the
others
stay
silent
willow
very
sympathetically
buffy
gives
them
a
little
smile
buffy
pauses
then
smiles
thinly
she
walks
out
of
the
library
while
looking
down
at
the
floor
willow
watches
her
friend
go
contemplating
the
meaning
of
it
all
giles
eventually
starts
to
go
back
to
his
office
as
he
walks
around
willow
she
gets
up
from
her
chair
he
starts
toward
his
office
again
willow
begins
to
realize
that
he'd
made
the
whole
spell
issue
up
to
get
buffy
to
talk
and
release
her
inner
sorrow
scott
stops
scott
pulls
on
his
backpack
buffy
begins
to
ramble
buffy
exhales
scott
looks
around
awkwardly
scott
shrugs
buffy
nods
in
understanding
he
starts
down
the
hall
for
a
few
steps
stops
and
immediately
comes
back
buffy
smiles
scott
smiles
buffy
smiles
back
at
him
warmly
buffy
quietly
gently
she
places
the
ring
on
the
floor
she
reflects
for
a
moment
before
standing
back
up
looking
at
the
great
hall
around
her
she
turns
around
and
slowly
starts
to
walk
away
toward
the
main
door
the
camera
shows
her
walking
from
a
high
angle
giving
a
good
view
of
the
cavernous
room
when
she's
gone
the
camera
cuts
to
the
ring
the
picture
fades
to
black
a
moment
later
a
bright
beam
of
light
illuminates
the
ring
on
the
floor
it
gets
more
and
more
intense
and
the
ring
begins
to
vibrate
clinking
madly
against
the
marble
suddenly
the
room
is
awash
with
a
blindingly
bright
white
light
emanating
from
a
dimensional
portal
opening
above
the
ring
a
body
falls
through
and
hits
the
stone
floor
hard
the
light
fades
as
the
portal
closes
and
a
naked
man
is
left
lying
there
he
is
unsteady
as
he
tries
to
get
up
but
he
is
too
weak
to
do
more
than
lift
his
face
it
is
angel
looking
very
dazed
his
breathing
is
shallow
and
labored
and
he
shivers
violently
as
he
looks
up
at
the
room
around
him
