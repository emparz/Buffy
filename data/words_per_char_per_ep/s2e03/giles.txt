her
calculations

the
night
of
st
vigeous

he
led
a
crusade
of
of
uh
vampires
they
swept
through
edessa
harran
and
points
east
you're
being
a
tad
flip

you
think
this
is
serious

slaves
to
the
uh
television
young
people
nowadays
shall
we
go
spike
that's
what
the
other
vampire
called
him
that's
a
little
unorthodox
isn't
it
perhaps
he
went
by
another
name
in
times
past
well
he
can't
be
any
worse
than
any
other
creature
you've
faced
uh
we
do
have
slightly
more
urgent
matters
to
discuss
angel
do
you
know
if
this
spike
fellow
goes
under
any
other
name
for
three
nights
the
unholy
ones
scourge
themselves
into
a
fury
um
culminating
in
a
savage
attack
on
the
night
of
st
vigeous
oh
there
you
are
our
new
friend
spike
he's
known
as
'william
the
bloody'
earned
his
nickname
by
torturing
his
victims
with
railroad
spikes
very
pleasant
well
here's
some
good
news
he's
barely
two
hundred
he's
not
even
as
old
as
angel
is
oh
i
think
your
suggestion
of
running
away
this
saturday
might've
been
a
good
one
spike
has
fought
two
slayers
in
the
last
century
and
he's
killed
them
both
what
the
hell
back
they've
cut
the
phones
wait
a
minute
there's
an
old
boarded
upcellar
behind
the
stacks
you
can
get
out
that
way
find
angel
he
knows
about
spike
we
need
him
no
one
will
be
alright
unless
we
get
some
help
