being
crushed

buffy
looks
at
him
like
he's
insane
he
does
his
best
not
to
scream
but
lets
out
a
few
grunts
of
pain
buffy
keeps
scraping
the
rope
on
the
screw
he
wakes
he
quickly
gets
up
grabs
his
coat
and
staggers
out
the
door
still
weak
and
not
bothering
to
close
it
behind
him
he
and
buffy
see
a
diffuse
green
light
shine
through
the
shop
windows
and
the
shadow
of
eyghon
jenny
coming
to
the
door
the
door
opens
and
eyghon
jenny
steps
in
well
on
her
way
to
transforming
into
eyghon
eyghon
jenny
to
ethan
in
a
deep
male
voice
buffy
is
almost
through
the
rope
under
the
table
eyghon
jenny
steps
up
to
ethan
he
stares
at
her
in
fear
she
sniffs
a
few
times
and
realizes
he's
not
the
one
she's
after
anymore
she
turns
to
buffy
and
her
eyes
glow
eyghon
jenny
shoves
ethan
aside
just
as
buffy
gets
through
the
rope
buffy
rolls
off
of
the
table
and
onto
the
floor
as
eyghon
jenny
lunges
for
her
she
kicks
up
and
flips
eyghon
jenny
and
the
table
over
and
onto
the
floor
they
both
get
up

pushing
her
into

out
at

and
she
goes
flying
into
a
pile
of
boxes
eyghon
jenny
grabs
giles
by
the
collar

around
and
down

stands
over

bends
down
to

convulsing
when

hits
the
floor

lets
go
of
giles
and
he
immediately
gets
on
his

face
twists
and
contorts
as
the
demons
inside
of
him
fight
it
out
he
is
thrown
to
the
crate
and
hits
his
head
his
face
goes
through
a
few
more
contortions
when
eyghon
suddenly
appears
apparently
gaining
the
upper
hand
after
a
moment
angel's
face
shifts
back
to
normal
then
back
to
eyghon
then
back
to
normal
again
he
is
thrown
back
against
the
wall
another
moment's
struggle
and
the
demon
inside

throws
eyghon
out
without
a
host
body
to
occupy

quickly
crumbles
into
ashes
