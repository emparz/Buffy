yeah
the
hype
was
out
of
control
may
be
more
where
that
came
from
i
say
we
go
back
out
again
tonight
don't
worry
about
it
giles
you
got
that
danger
room
set
up
out
back
i'm
feeling
the
need
for
a
little
physical
rehab
about
now
sure
thing
so
what
do
i
do
new
terrain
so
you
need
me
to
light
incense
and
pour
sand
something
you
do
alone
you
sure
this
isn't
just
your
way
of
trying
to
make
me
feel
less
what
are
the
words
cute
and
weak
and
kittenish
right
much
manlier
look
i
really
am
okay
so
i'm
not
quite
super
guy
anymore
it
was
borrowed
power
anyway
had
to
give
it
back
some
time
maybe
instead
of
you
trying
to
take
care
of
me
we
agree
to
take
care
of
each
other
deal
for
luck
have
a
nice
trip
