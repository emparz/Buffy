i
looked
up
demons

their
victims

that
oh

i
got
a
good
one
a
demon
called
gnarl
he's
a
parasite
with
these
nasty
long
fingernails
he
secretes
something
through
them
and
uses
that
to
paralyze
his
victims
he
then
cuts
strips
of
their
skin
while
they're
still
alive
it
takes
hours
you
wouldn't
he
eats
them
that's
why
he's
a
parasite
it's
like
his
natural
food
you
never
said
pool
of
blood
then
this
is
your
guy
he
laps
up
the
blood
you
could
say
it's
like
his
natural
beverage
now

we
just
knew
how
to
find
this
thing
right
minute
traces
of
blood

have
a—

smellementary

i'm
sure
there's
tons
of
stuff
like
this
you
know
procedures
we
can
use
that
don't
involve
magic
spells
just
good
solid
detective
work
and
we
can
develop
a
database
of
tooth
impressions
and
demon
skin
samples
and
i
could
wear
high
heels
more
often
everybody
loves
a
slender
ankle
