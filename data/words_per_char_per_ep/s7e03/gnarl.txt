they
were
here
here
they
were
and
there
they
went
gone
all
gone
what
a
pretty
song
they
sealed
you
in
with
me
i
love
a
gifty
can't
wait
to
unwrap
it
gnarl
makes
a
pretty
picture
it's
easy
when
you
know
how
it's
easy
when
everyone
helps
they
helped
me
too
bad
there's
no
one
to
help
you
they
don't
want
you
lock
you
in
nice
white
skin
and
if
they
do
return
where
will
the
find
you
inside
me
you'll
already
be
aww
love
it
