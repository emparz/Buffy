get
the
sign
i
don't
think
she's
gonna
see
the
sign
we've
heard
the
crayon
speech
a
few
times
not
that
it's
not
great
of
course
yeah
it's
gonna
be
weird
seeing
her
what
do
you
say
to
someone
in
this
situation
c'mon
you're
saying
it's
not
going
to
be
the
least
bit
strange
we
saw
her
kill
someone
she
was
about
to
kill
dawn—
she
kinda
didn't
finish
hhe
said
it
was
really
important
that
she
come
back
early
and
that
she
was
doing
really
well
and
we
shouldn't
worry
they
absolutely
put
her
on
the
plane
in
london
maybe
she
doubled
back
got
off
the
plane
in
london
after
giles
left
i
hope
you're
right
because
defeating
lazy
willow—probably
less
hard
's
a
good
idea
upstairs
definitely
not
up
there
i
checked
with
giles
again
too
hasn't
heard
from
her
oh
with
extra
wig
he's
blaming
himself
pretty
hard
like
he
should've
known
she
wasn't
ready
to
come
back
ii
kept
telling
him
you
know
it
wasn't
his
fault
maybe
something
about
us
she
couldn't
face
look
if
willow
flipped
out
it's
her
bad
we
can
only
be
here
for
her
so
much
if
she
won't
be
you
know
here
no
skin
and
yet
my
eyes
refuse
to
look
away
stupid
eyes
i
got
to
get
a
job
where
i
don't
get
called
right
away
for
this
stuff
i
think
i
hear
him
spike
spike
the
church
you
scared
me
a
little
i
didn't—i
didn't
know
what
to
think
spike
we
need
to
know
who
did
this
spike
please
this
isn't
the
time
might
as
well
go
he's
talking
about
willow
maybe
he
saw
her
is
there
something
here
something
that
killed
she
knows
about
viscera
makes
you
proud
i
need
to
do
something
i
just—i
have
this
feeling
in
my
gut—
—that
we
know
exactly
who
did
this
and
all
of
this
work
that
we're
doing
is
just
a
way
for
us
to
convince
ourselves
that
willow's
ok
dawn
you're
new
at
this
and
i
get
why
you're
proud
but
i'm
not
exactly
sure
why
this
demon
is
any
more
likely
than
any
of
the
others
there
was
no
pool
just
splatters
or
we
could
be
smart
sorry
xander
wwhoever
did
this
had
to
get
blood
on
them
which
means
they
left
a
trail
and
we
have
a
way
to
track
it
yes
let's
tie
ourselves
to
the
crazy
vampire
it's
pretty
easy
spike
follows
the
exciting
smell
of
blood
and
we
follow
the
fairly
ripe
smell
of
spike
wow
that
was
so
close
to
being
empowered
that's
a
rock
cliff
shh
do
you
hear
that
guess
we're
in
the
right
place
it's
echoing
i
know
it
sounds
close
but
i
don't
think—
dawn
are
you
ok
dawn
ok
we
need
to
get
her
out
of
here
we'll
deal
with
him
later
seal
him
in
the
computer
that
thing
dawn
was
reading
might
have
an
antidote
for
the
paralysis
what
oh
it's
ok
just
like
you
said
it
would
so
good
on
you
ok
watch—watch
the
head
ok
i'm
gonna
check
the
computer
find
that
page
see
if
there's
an
antidote
oh
got
it
it
says
the
paralysis
is
permanent
no
oh
wait
my
bad
permanent
until
the
creature
dies
sorry
guess
we
have
to
go
back
do
you
think
she'll
vomit
i'll
call
anya
she
can
watch
her
she's
not
dying
she's
just
paralyzed
hey
she's
poseable
where'd
you
get
the
nuts
yeah
i
don't
think
we
could
call—
wait
you
saw
willow
anya
listen
this
is
really
important
did
willow
go
to
that
cave
xander
she
could
be
there
right
now
willow
could
be
trapped
with
the
gnarl
anya
you
know
about
this
creature
you're
coming
with
us
hurry
what's
going
on
where's
willow
i
don't
know
but
i'm
starting
to
get
why
we
haven't
seen
her
i
have
this
feeling
that
whatever's
causing
this
invisible
thing
is
a
whole
separate
issue
from
the
skineating
monster
close
one
willow
are
you
here
willow
willow
wwe
can't
exactly
see
you
but
we're
really
glad
that
you're
back
ii
don't
know
how
badly
you're
hurt
but—
it's
gonna
be
ok
willow
you're
gonna
be
ok
oh
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
i
didn't
realize
meditating
was
such
hard
work
wow
that's
magic
right
i
mean
when
most
people
when
they
meditate
don't
get
extra
skin
right
'cause
clem
should
like
cut
back
we're
on
the
second
floor
explains
why
my
fingernails
get
dirty
even
when
i
don't
do
anything
true
you're
wiped
out
ii
should
go
we
missed
you
too
i
missed
you
dawn's
uh
working
on
what
caused
the
mutual
noseeums
but
so
far
we
haven't—
you
did
a
spell
so
you
made
it
happen
just
by
thinking
it
it's
ok
as
long
as
you're
all
right
i
have
a
confession
to
make
i
thought
it
might
be
you
with
the
flaying
i
wanna
be
the
kind
of
person
that
wouldn't
think
that
xander
never
thought
it
i
thought
you
were
too
tired
i'm
sorry
i
got
so
much
strength
i'm
giving
it
away
will
it
help
good
