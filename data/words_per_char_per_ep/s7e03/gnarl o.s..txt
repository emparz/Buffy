all
alone

are
you
frightened
to
be
all
alone
the
wind
talks
when
you're
alone
all
alone
look
at
the
shorn
lamb
see
how
he
trembles
is
it
the
cold
wind
or
is
it
that
the
flock
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
poor
little
lamb
all
alone

ha
ha
ha
no
way
out
now
no
way
out
gnarl
loves
spells
he
keeps
them
as
pets
they
love
him
and
they
leave
him
alone
your
friends
left
you
here

no
one
comes
to
save
you

they
wanted
me
to
have
you
did
they
leave
you
as
a
gifty
for
me
are
you
a
tasty
little
gifty
or
did
they
just
throw
you
away
