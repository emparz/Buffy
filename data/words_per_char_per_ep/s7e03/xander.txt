you
think
she'll
get
the
sign
i
used
yellow
crayon
it
was
a
thing
from
when
i
talked
to
willow
on
the
bluff
i
hope
she
gets
it
well
i
was
talking
from
my
heart
and
i
knew
evil
willow
wasn't
really
ready
toâ€”
you
were
kidding
i
saved
the
world
with
talking
from
my
mouth
my
mouth
saved
the
world
i'm
gonna
say
hi
willow
and
giles
wouldn't
let
her
leave
unless
she
completed
that
whatever
recovery
course
guys
i
just
noticed
something
everyone's
off
the
plane
so
where's
willow
so
she
got
off
in
chicago
when
they
stopped
well
i've
avoided
giles
tons
of
times
just
meant
i
was
lazy
not
evil
willow
is
that
you
is
he
throwing
a
tasteful
british
wiggins
like
she
didn't
think
we
were
ready
to
forgive
her
i
get
that
tough
to
look
at
i
found
it
first
thing
this
morning
i
gave
my
crew
the
day
off
and
i
called
you
right
away
yeah
i
know
exactly
what
you're
thinking
maybe
willow
is
back
we
can't
use
the
blueprints
to
find
our
way
around
down
here
it's
like
the
walls
move
or
something
we're
here
for
a
reason
spike
he
knows
he
must
have
seen
the
body
boy
he's
extrauseful
today
and
that
means
something
because
he's
chockfullosanity
her
boy
i'm
her
boy
just
skin
what's
up
in
your
viscera
we
didn't
find
any
strips
of
skin
which
by
the
way
gghhhh
you're
terrifying
well
we
could
ask
some
questions
over
at
willy's
place
what
what
how
what's
going
on
should've
put
a
leash
on
him
you
really
think
it's
gonna
work
well
give
him
a
break
buffy
maybe
it's
a
vicious
skineating
rock
cliff
dark
and
dank
i
was
hoping
it'd
be
dark
and
dank
no
i
don't
but
now
i
do
yep
you
couldn't
help
it
it
had
paralyzing
fingernails
gotcha
sofa
she's
right
face
up
is
better
it'll
be
all
right
we'll
get
you
fixed
up
you'll
be
doing
limbo
in
no
time
no
not
as
a
pole
i
promise
we
can't
just
leave
her
here
like
this
what
if
she
vomits
right
she'll
love
being
called
for
vomit
watch
paralyzed
how
in
the
not
moving
way
oh
you're
poseable
anya
you
gotta
keep
up
what
where
there's
nothing
here
because
we
haven't
seen
her
ew
ew
thumbs
i
can't
believe
you
did
that
where
is
she

alive

of
hereish

not
going
away
