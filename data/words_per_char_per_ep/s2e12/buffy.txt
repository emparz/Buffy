have
kids
anytime
soon
uh
maybe
someday
in
the
future
when
i'm
done
having
a
life

right
now
kids
would
be
just
a
little
too
much
to
deal
with
oh
that's
okay
um
ii
figured
there
were
all
sorts
of
things
vampires

work
for
the
telephone
company
or
volunteer
for
the
red
cross

just
a
trap
from

perfectly
normal
yeah
giles

research
mode
great
you

i
always
say
that
a
day

dissect
it
and
i
slayed
my
work

bez
hey
xander
hey
you

i'm
gonna
have
a
big
bump
something

out
of
the
way
giles
well
he
picked
a
helluva
time
to
get
a
life
we
can't
fight
these
things
until
we
know
something
about
'em
a
bozo
not
a
bozo
that's
it
okay
so
now
we
look
it
up
a
book
giles
said
he
was
gonna
try
to
find
something
and
i'd
say
he
found
something
'preprehistoric
parasite
the
mother
hibernates
underground
laying
eggs
the
offspring
then
attach
themselves
to
a
host
taking
control
of
their
motor
functions
through
neural
clamping'
xander
'neural
clamping'
that
sounds
skippable
so
our
people
are
taking
orders
from
the
mama
bezoar
which
begs
the
question
are
you
