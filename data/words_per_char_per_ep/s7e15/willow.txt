heavy
though
just
the
lighter
safer
stuff
uh

much
cooler
than

not
come
on
buffy
you
know
everyone
here's
doing
everything
they
can
those
are
muppets
no
it
doesn't
where
does
it
say
that
it
doesn't
say
that
no
buffy
we

we
get
you

buffy
thanks
for
your
support
there

and
buffy
knew
it
i've
got
to
get
her
back
oh
iii
don't
even
know
what
magic
to
use
that's
not
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
that's
what
i'm
saying—i
don't
even
know
uh
physics
principles
basic
laws
uh
conservation
of
energies
you
can't
really
create
or
destroy
anything
only
transfer
magic
works
off
physics
like
aa
kraken's
tooth
maybe
'til
we
get
the
magicks
up
and
running
i'm
kinda
working
on
my
best
guess
here
no
i
don't
think
we
should
wait
right
now
opening
a
portal
this
size
could
take
days
i
think
i
might
pee
my
pants
ok
via
temporis
iam
clamo
ad
te
via
spatii
te
jubeo
aperire
aperi
dawnie
you'd
better
put
on
some
coffee
this
could
take
awhile—
via
concursus
tempus
spatium
audi
me
ut
imperio
screw
it
mighty
forces
i
suck
at
latin
ok
but
that's
not
the
issue
i'm
the
one
in
charge
and
i'm
telling
you
open
up
portal
now
no
hey
you
ok
you've
been
kinda
quiet
since
yeah
since
then
look
it's
important
that
you
know
what
i
am
what
i'm
like
when
i'm
like
that
i'm
really
sorry
it's
just
you
were
the
most
powerful
person
nearby
and—well
that's—that's
how
it
works
that's
how
i
work
how
you
doing
well
that's
what
i
do
aw
it's
all
right
you
needed
to
be
although
twinkies
and
kisses—also
peachy
motivational
tools
you
ok
what
so
you
turned
it
down
