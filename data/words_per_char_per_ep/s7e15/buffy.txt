potential
slayers—who
seem
to
keep
popping
up
from
like
every
corner
of
the
earth—
were
getting
killed
agents
of
we
thought
the
council
could
protect
them
but
unfortunately
no
one
was
protecting
the
council
and
all
their
watchers
were
killed
word
got
out
and
they've
all
been
coming
here
since
it's
heartwarming

just—the
first
is
coming
and
then
look
at
us

a
bunch
of
fighters
with
nothing
to
hit
a
wicca

the
brains
of
our
operation
wears
oven
mitts
figured
i'm
showing
him
our
operation

think
we'd
better
get
back
upstairs
and
i
didn't
know
what
was
possible
anything
we
could
use
they're
worse
than
the
french

keep
on
it
don't

any
real
homework

of
you

the
first
we'll
be
here
what's
ttfn
dawn
where's
that
knife
is
everyone
here
anyone
want
to
say
a
few
words
about
chloe
let
me
chloe
was
an
idiot
chloe
was
stupid
she
was
weak
and
anyone
in
a
rush
to
be
the
next
dead
body
i
bury
it's
easy
justthink
of
chloe
and
do
what
she
did
and
i'll
find
room
for
you
next
to
her
and
annabelle
i'm
the
slayer
the
one
with
the
power
and
the
first
has
me
using
that
power
to
dig
our
graves
i've
been
carrying
you—all
of
you—too
far
too
long
ride's
over
you're
new
here
and
you're
wrong
because
i
use
the
power
that
i
have
the
rest
of
you
are
just
waiting
for
me
well
from
now
on
i'm
your
leader
as
in
do
what
i
say
then
why
are
you
here
aside
from
getting
rescued
what
is
it
that
you
do
you're
here
because
you're
scared
fine
anya
all
of
you
be
as
scared
as
you'd
like
just
be
useful
while
you're
at
it
the
first
isn't
impressed
it
already
knows
us
it
knows
what
we
can
do
and
it's
laughing
you
want
to
surprise
the
enemy
surprise
yourselves
force
yourself
to
do
what
can't
be
done
or
else
we
are
not
an
army—we're
just
a
bunch
of
girls
waiting
to
be
picked
off
and
buried
where
are
you
going
fine
take
a
cell
phone
that
way
if
i
need
someone
to
get
weepy
or
whaled
on
i
can
call
you
just
said
it
you
keep
holding
back
you
might
as
well
walk
out
that
door
since
you
got
your
soul
back
you
were
a
better
fighter
then
what
i
want
is
the
spike
that's
dangerous
the
spike
that
tried
to
kill
me
when
we
met
i'm
nowhere
near
him
dawn
get
the
potentials
upstairs
and
break
out
that
emergency
kit
i'm
declaring
an
emergency
we
thought
you'd
want
to
be
here
you
can't
just
watch
you
have
to
see
see
what
ii
saw
her
the
other
night—in
my
dream
it's
gotta
mean
something
right
what
about
darkness
it
means
i
have
to
go
in
there
that's
the
point
find
a
way
well
guess
that
worked
hello
i'm
buffy
i'm
the
slayer
good
that's
good
then
um
you
know
i
know
we
have
bigger
issues
to
deal
with
but
how'd
i
understand
anything
you
guys
just
said
oh
i
know
ancient
magicks
i
just
thought
it
was
neat
the
neat
of
it
just
left
end
of
what
latest
you
mean
latest
guardian
ok
um
i
have
a
first
to
fight
ok
so
just
tell
me
what
i
need
to
know
i
came
to
learn
you
know
what
i
think
i'm
not
really
here
at
all
none
of
this
is
actually
happening
this
is
like
a
play
like
some
shadowplay
some
nonreality
reenactment
hologramy—
what
is
this
i
thought
i
brought
me
here
listen
you
guys
i'm
already
the
slayer
bursting
with
power
really
don't
need
any
more
this
is
how
you—
no
by
making
me
less
human
make
this
stop
no
this
isn't
the
way
you
think
i
came
all
this
way
to
get
knocked
up
by
some
demon
dust
i
can't
fight
this
i
know
that
now
but
you
guys
you're
just
men
just
the
men
who
did
thisto
her
whoever
that
girl
was
before
she
was
the
first
slayer
no
you
don't
understand
you
violated
that
girl
made
her
kill
for
you
because
you're
weak
you're
pathetic
and
you
obviously
have
nothing
to
show
me
i
knew
it
it's
always
the
staff
tell
me
something
i
don't
know
thanks
for
bringing
me
back
again
i
was
hard
on
you
guys
today
i
think
i
made
a
mistake
those
men
that
i
met—you
know
the
shadow
men
they
offered
me
more
power
but
i
didn't
like
the
loophole
i
don't
know
they
showed
me
that
the
first
slayer
was
right—it
isn't
enough
