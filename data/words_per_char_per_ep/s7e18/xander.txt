i
know
it's
hard
hey
listen
it's
gonna
be
ok
buffy
knows
what
she's
doing
she's
not
gonna
send
you
into
battle
until
she's
sure
you're
ready
for
action
you
have
to
trust
us
well
believe
it
or
not
i
was
younger
than
you
when
i
started
all
this
yeah
well
uh—
colleen
um
we
can't
the
others
might
hear
us
wha—
what's
going
on
i
was
sleeping
i'll
be
right
out
got
uh
a
leg
cramp
an
unknown
man
breezes
into
town
says
he
has
something
of
yours
buffy
this
thing's
got
trap
written
all
over
it
now
remember
we're
looking
for
killing
blows
only
people
so
chest
and
throat
if
it's
a
vampire
stomach
chest
and
face
if
it's
a
bringer
could
happen
something
otherworldly
and
here's
a
handy
rule
don't
go
for
the
flashy
tentacles
just
because
they're
waving
'em
about
trying
to
get
attention
go
for
the
center—
brains
heart
eyes
everything's
got
eyes
except
the
bringers
matthew
broderick
did
not
kill
godzilla
he
killed
a
big
dumb
lizard
that
was
not
the
real
godzilla
than
who
well
that's
where
generally
speaking
you'd
go
to
find
the
bad
guy
and
i
don't
think
you
came
here
to
fight
plaque
well
you
signed
on
to
fight
with—
let
me
tell
you
something
about
buffy
in
fact
you
should
all
listen
to
this
i've
been
through
more
battles
with
buffy
than
you
all
can
ever
imagine
she's
stopped
everything
that's
ever
come
up
against
her
she's
laid
down
her
life—literally—to
protect
the
people
around
her
this
girl
has
died
two
times
and
she's
still
standing
you're
scared
that's
smart
you
got
questions
you
should
but
you
doubt
her
motives
you
think
buffy's
all
about
the
kill
then
you
take
the
little
bus
to
battle
i've
seen
her
heart
and
this
time—not
literally
and
i'm
telling
you
right
now
she
cares
more
about
your
lives
than
you
will
ever
know
you
gotta
trust
her
she's
earned
it
so
what's
the
signal
got
it
buffy
are
you
ok
let's
go
come
on
let's
go
come
on
