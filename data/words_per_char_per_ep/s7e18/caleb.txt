what's
goin'
on
was
someone
hurt
what
is
it
well
that
was
uh
are
you
all
right
well
let's
not
give
him
credit
for
everything
no
i'm
funning
you
i
don't
believe
it
was
a
coincidence
i
also
don't
believe
young
girls
should
be
out
in
the
woods
late
at
night—should
be
tucked
in
bed
i
expect
you
do
at
that
look
i
don't
mean
to
pry
but
those
boys
they
looked
like—
well
you
didn't
happen
to
fall
in
with
devil
worshipers
did
you
na
i'm—i'm
sorry
you
uh
you
look
like
you've
been
traveling
a
while
i
didn't
think
that—
is
there
some
place
you'd
like
me
to
drop
you
you
heading
some
place
i'm
going
there
myself
i
ain't
never
been
but
i
expect
we
could
find
a
police
station
or
a—
call
me
caleb
never
was
nobody's
daddy
well
shannon
you
feel
like
telling
me
why
those
freaky
joe's
were
after
you
well
do
you
ever
think
that
maybe
they
were
chasing
you
because
you're
a
whore
now
i
know
what
you're
thinking
crazy
preacher
man
spoutin'
off
at
the
mouth
about
the
whore
of
babylon
or
somesuch
that
ain't
me
i'm
not
here
to
lecture
you
i
mean
what's
the
point
my
words
just
curdle
in
your
ears
wouldn't
take
in
a
thing
head's
filled
with
so
much
filth
that
ain't
no
room
for
words
of
truth
well
you
know
what
you
are
shannon
dirty
now
now
now
there's
no
blame
here
you
were
born
dirty
born
without
a
soul
born
with
that
gaping
maw
wants
to
open
up
suck
out
a
man's
marrow
makes
me
puke
to
think
too
hard
on
it
yeah
that
there
door's
problematical
i
don't
know
as
i
could
recommend
steppin'
out
at
this
speed
anyway
you're
like
as
not
to
tumble
some
but
of
course
there's
my
boys
back
there—ooh
they
hate
to
miss
a
mark
well
they
ain't
exactly
my
blue
eyed
boys
but
they're
hard
workers
and
they
don't
truck
with
satan—that
was
just
me
having
fun
satan
is
a
little
man
i
don't
like
backseat
drivers
well
now
is
this
the
part
where
you
offer
to
do
anything
because
i
tried
to
make
it
clear—you
got
nothin'
i
want
to
explore
oh
yeah
that's
it
that's
a
cleansing
fire
hallelujah
now
if
i'm
not
mistaken
there's
a
car
a
little
ways
behind
us
and
i
do
believe
there's
some
folk
in
it
goin'
the
same
place
you
are
now
i
want
you
to
deliver
a
message
for
me
but
it's
not
for
them
it's
for
the
other
one—the
one
and
only
the
original
acceptnosubstitutes
slayer
would
you
tell
her
something
for
me
thank
you
shannon
now
let's
see
what
we
can't
do
about
that
door
drink
of
this
for
it
is
my
blood
you
know
i
always
loved
the
story
of
the
last
supper
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
becoming
rich
red
wine
i
recall
as
a
boy
though
i
couldn't
help
but
think
what
would
happen
if
you
were
at
the
last
supper
and
you
ordered
the
white
a
nice
oaky
chardonnay
or
white
zin
i
mean
would
he
make
that
out
of
his
lymph
or
someall
never
did
bring
it
up
suppose
there
was
a
reason
why
i
never
spent
too
long
in
one
parish
just
looking
for
answers
just
looking
for
the
lord
in
the
wrong
damn
places
then
you
showed
me
the
light
i
certainly
do
not
i
am
beyond
concepts
like
that
man
can't
turn
his
back
on
what
he
come
from
besides
black
is
slimming
everyone
knows
that
just
another
dirty
girl
and
since
you
only
dress
up
in
dead
folk
i'm
guessing
one
who's
already
been
paid
her
wage
strength
and
the
loneliness
that
comes
with
real
strength
you're
her
at
long
last
all
this
time
all
the
work
i've
done
for
you
blowing
up
the
council
organizing
the
ray
charles
brigade
and
stickin'
all
them
splits—you
never
showed
me
oh
yeah
yeah
she'll
get
the
message
curiosity
woman's
first
sin
i
offer
her
an
apple
what
can
she
do
but
take
it
i'll
see
you
soon
you're
searching
for
something
girl
what
would
that
be
now
is
that
right
well
the
truth
is
like
a
sword
isn't
it
girl
cuts
deep
the
words
i
use
got
a
power
to
them
a
power
now
they're
not
just
words—they're
truth
they
called
you
you
know
why
because
you're
human
you
got
your
urges
a
woman's
got
hers
a
man's
got
his
our
whole
race
can
be
do
damnably
weak
that's
why
we
seek
the
strength
the
power
oh
no
child
it's
not
wrong
just
human
heathens
no
appreciations
for
life's
pleasures
do
it
again
no
save
them
for
later
i'm
in
more
of
an
old
memory
lane
kind
of
mood
back
before
i
met
you
there
was
this
choir
girl
in
knoxville
i
used
to
give
singing
lessons
towhy
she
even
screamed
on
key
show
me
her
i
only
told
them
the
truth
as
for
following
well
that
seems
to
be
what
they
do
best
well
now
you
girls
are
just
burning
with
righteousness
aren't
you
problem
is
you
think
you're
blazing
like
suns
when
really
you're
burning
like
matchsticks
in
the
face
of
the
darkness
you
having
fun
now
i
hope
my
boys
haven't
worn
you
out
too
much—i
need
you
fit
for
when
i
purify
you
well
i
do
now
you
liked
my
little
message
did
you
you
know
i
ruined
a
perfectly
good
knife
on
that
girl
got
her
soiled
blood
all
over
the
place
i
may
have
to
get
a
new
truck
so
you're
the
slayer
the
slayer
the
strongest
the
fastest
the
most
aflame
with
that
most
precious
invention
of
all
mankind—the
notion
of
goodness
the
slayer
must
indeed
be
powerful
so
what
else
you
got
miss
i
do
believe
you
have
your
own
problems
you
should
be
worrying
about
oh
good
there's
more
of
you
well
you're
the
other
one
aren't
you
your
cain
to
her
abel
no
offense
meant
to
cain
of
course
oh
it
has
its
moments
paul
had
some
good
stuff
for
instance
but
overall
i
find
it
a
tad
complicated

i
like
to
keep
things
simple
good
folk
bad
folk
clean
folk
dirty
folk
yes
what
can
i
say
i
work
in
mysterious
ways
also
some
fairly
straightforward
ones
you're
the
one
who
sees
everything
aren't
you
well
let's
see
what
we
can't
do
about
that
she
didn't
know
the
good
news
the
glory
that
was
coming
that'd
be
you
for
the
kingdom
the
power
and
the
glory
are
yours
now
and
forever
you
show
up
they'll
get
in
line
