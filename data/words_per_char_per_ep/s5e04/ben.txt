lent
you
his
stethoscope
buffy
right
i'm
ben
i'm
an
intern
here
i've
had
the
pleasure
of
hanging
out
with
the
renowned
dr
dawn
here
while
your
mom's
being
tested
well
she's
doing
okay
now

the
doctors
don't
really
know
what
caused
the
collapse

it
could've
just
been
a
dizzy
spell
low
blood
sugar
that
sort
of
thing
very
unlikely
so
your
mom
doesn't
have
a

history
of
fainting
well
i
think
they'll
be
running
tests
for
a
few
more
hours
then
they'll
probably
want
her
to
come
back
for
some
followup
tests
in
a
couple
weeks
but
it
really
doesn't
look
like
anything
too
serious
i
think
you'll
be
able
to
take
her
home
before
too
long
