i
know
i'm
repeating
myself
here
but
i
don't
know
what
else
to
say
to
convince
you
i
have
never
in
all
my
years
of
medicine
let
a
patient
with
tachycardia
this
severe
leave
a
hospital
legally
no
i
can't
force
you
to
do
a
thing
but
with
that
pulse
believe
me
i'd
get
on
my
knees
and
beg
you
if
i
thought
i
could
change
your
mind
and
your
friend
here
can't
convince
you
to
riley
holds
up
a
hand
to
stop
her
all
right
then
but
you're
leaving
against
my
recommendation
