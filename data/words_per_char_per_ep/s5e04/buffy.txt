riley
my
job
watch
out
never
mind
why
do
i
even
bother
to
show
up
spike
what
are
you
doing
here
better
keep
out
of
my
way
spike
i'm
not
gonna
take
this
much
longer
would
it
keep
you
out
of
my
way
spike

i
just
saw
you
taste
your
own
nose
blood
you
know
what
i'm
too
grossed
out
to
hear
anything
you
have
to
say
go
home
of
course
not
ii
was
just

startled
and
you
know
i
don't

love
the
idea
of
you
patrolling
alone
no
you
made
the
squad
you

threw
that
vampire
like
he
was
a

teenyweeny
little
vampire
nah
unless
you
wanna
go
back
and
kill
spike
for
the
fun
of
it
will
you're
totally
missing
my
point
now
i
agree
that
marat
wasn't
a
real
martyr
but
the
death
in
the
tub

the
neck
wound
all
that
blood
just
a
little
more
fangy
than
knifey
i
mean
charlotte
corday
wasn't
a
real
martyr
either
but
what
your
what
apparently
not
don't
worry
will
you
still
wear
the
smartypants
in
the
family
i'm
trying

really
piling
on
the
reading
and
giles
fills
any
free
time

have
with
extra
training

starting
to
think

occipital
lobe

have
a
heart
attack
hey

are
you
oh
uhuh

i
don't
think
we
should
be
i
don't
get
what
he's
thinking
why
isn't
he
worried
nobody's
body
can
handle
a
heart
attack
i
just
keep
coming

to
the
initiative
dawn

i
have
to
do
something
i
just
don't
know
what
yeah
but
call
them
how
first
of
all
they
don't
exist
any
more
and
secondly
they
never
claimed
to
exist
in
the
first
place
it's
so
unfair
i
mean
iit's
like
big
brother
can
spy
on
you
all
the
time
andand
the
second
i
have
something
to
say
no
one
will
listen
like
what
take
a
tour
of
the
white
house
and
pretend
to
get
lost
and
look
for
some
door
with
a
sign
on
it
that
says
secret
government
monster
hunters
i
gotta
go
uh
see
you
guys
later
riley
riley's

you
even
gonna
tell
me
what's
wrong
with
him

if
you
tell
me
to
hurry

i'll
kick
your
ass
no
he's
not
at
his
apartment
he's
not
at
the
gym
he's
not
at
the
library

he's
gone
somewhere
where
he
doesn't
wanna
be
found
basically
exactly
well
here's
a
hot
tip
if
you
want
attention
be
there
so
people
can
give
it
to
you
homey
you
know
what
else
he
might
find
homey
in
a

dank
unpleasant
evil
sort
of
way
the
initiative
caves
i
don't
know
them
too
well
i
so
don't
want
to
deal
with
spike
right
now
that
guy
is
really
starting
to
bug
me
in
that
special
i
wanna
shove
something
wooden
through
his
heart
kinda
way
plus
hanging
out
all
day
in
that
moldy
crypt
you
just
know
he's
doing
something
nasty
i've
got
a
proposition
for
you
riley's
sick
with
some
initiative
thing
and
he's
missing
i
think
he
might
be
in
the
caves
you
find
him
bring
him
to
the
fourth
floor
of
the
hospital
their
doctors
get
to
him
in
time
you
get
the
cash
he
is
not
the
only
person
that
can
die
riley
riley
answer
me
please
riley
your
hand
is
bleeding
this
stops
now
i'm
taking
you
to
the
doctor
he's
the
only
one
that
understands
what's
wrong
with
you
he's
the
only
one
that
can
help
yeah
and
this
feeling
is
going
to
kill
you
riley
your
body
was
not
built
for
this
kind
of
strength
riley
i
can
handle
it
this
is
my
deal
buffy
just

back
off
what
is
this
what's
happening
to
you

that's
not
enough
for
you
why
would
you
say
that
so
that's
what
this
is
about
you're
going
to
die
all
over
some
macho
pissing
contest

never
opened
up
to

god
you're
just
sitting
back
there

that
none
of
this
means
anything
to
me

mean
anything
to
you
do
you
really
think
so
little
of
me
riley
buffy
no
no

you
think
that
