do
you
think
you're
ready
to
fight
angel
don't
say
that
you're
gonna
pass
everything
i
will
get
you
through
this
semester
if
i
have
to
sweat
blood
it
was
only
metaphor
blood
sixth
period
after
my
computer
class
we'll
rock
on
chemistry
i
love
it
i
really
do
i
didn't
read
anything
about
oh
i
get
it
do
you
wanna
come
by
my
house
tonight
and
study
too
again
do
you
really
expect
angel
to
turn
up
tonight
well
sure
it
does
see
oh
no
this
doesn't
make
any
sense
it
is
but
at
least
you
know
that
so
you're
learning
okay
i
see
your
problem
will
you
stop
that
you're
not
stupid
you've
just
had
a
lot
on
your
mind
you
can
learn
this
real
easily
but
if
you're
just
gonna
give
up
then
don't
waste
my
time
okay
look
at
this
a
covalent
bond
which
means
these
two
atoms
are
linked
by
this
okay
so
see
here
really
it's
not
mine
it
might
be
something
of
ms
calendar's
i've
gone
through
most
of
her
files
already
i
had
to
to
teach
her
class
it's
one
of
her
spells
i
think
ms
calendar
wasn't
a
practicing
witch
but
she
did
dabble
oh
boy
oh
boy
oh
boy
looks
like
ms
calendar
was
trying
to
replicate
the
original
curse
to
restore
angel's
soul
again
well
i've
been
going
through
her
files
and
and
researching
the
black
arts
for
fun
or
educational
fun
and
i
may
be
able
to
work
this
and
i
don't
want
danger
big
'no'
to
danger
but
i
may
be
the
best
person
to
do
this
xander
what
do
you
wanna
do
okay
somebody
explain
the
whole
'he
will
suck
the
world
into
hell'
thing
because
that's
the
part
i'm
not
loving
i
don't
wanna
be
our
only
hope
uh
i
crumble
under
pressure
let's
have
another
hope
i
need
about
a
day
and
an
'orb
of
thesulah'
whatever
that
is
this
means
i
can't
help
you
study
for
tomorrow's
final
i
just
want
to
crosscheck
okay
then
i
need
maybe
half
an
hour
once
we're
all
set
up
'not
dead
nor
not
of
the
living
spirits
of
the
interregnum
i
call'
cut
to
the
graveyard
buffy
ducks
a
punch
from
angelus
and
comes
up
behind
him
he
spins
around
to
block
her
return
swing
he
blocks
another
jab
from
her
and
punches
her
in
the
face
he
follows
up
with
a
left
hook
and
buffy
loses
her
balance
and
nearly
falls
down
angelus
grabs
her
by
the
back
of
her
coat
and
throws
her
over
onto
the
grounds
she
rolls
away
and
onto
her
back
and
looks
up
at
him
'let
him
know
the
pain
of
humanity
gods
reach
your
wizened
hands
to
me
give
me
the
sword'
suddenly
a
vampire
comes
out
from
the
stacks
and
attacks
xander
from
behind
the
main
doors
fly
open
and
kendra
spins
around
to
defend
as
two
more
vampires
walk
in
giles
points
to
the
steps
and
yells
at
the
girls
as
a
fourth
vampire
appears
from
the
stacks
