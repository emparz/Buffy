hello
yes
oh
not
at
all
it's
flattered
to
be
asked
oh
he
may
have
uh
exaggerated
a
little
ah
is
this
the
a
few
none
i'd
care
to
share
until
i
can
verify
you
have
uh
carbon
dated
it
um
yes
it
it
certainly
predates
any
uh
settlements
we've
read
about
um
may
may
i
i
assume
you've
uh
you
haven't
tried
to
open
it
i
don't
know
yes
but
could
i
ask
um
would
you
wait
i
uh
aas
a
rule
no
yes
yes
so
am
i
what
are
you
saying
she
said
it
couldn't
be
done
um
well
this
um
certainly
points
the
way
but
the
ritual
itself
requires
a
greater
knowledge
of
the
black
arts
than
i
i
i
can
claim
wwillow
channeling
such
potent
magicks
through
yourself
it
could
open
a
door
that
you
may
not
be
able
to
close
let's
not
lose
our
perspective
here
xander
curing
angel
seems
to
have
been
jenny's
last
wish
don't
you
ever
speak
of
her
in
that
tone
again
i've
been
on
the
phone
to
the
museum
the
artifact
in
question
is
missing
and
the
curator
has
been
murdered
vampires
acathla
and
yes
the
information
provided
by
kendra's
watcher
seems
conclusive
well
the
uh
the
demon
universe
exists
in
a
dimension
separate
from
our
own
with
one
breath
acathla
will
create
a
vortex
aa
kind
of
um
whirlpool
that
will
pull
everything
on
earth
into
that
dimension
where
any
nondemon
life
will
suffer
horrible
and
eternal
torment
ooh
may
i
may
i
thank
you
well
llet's
uh
hope
all
else
doesn't
fail
um
how
close
are
you
to
ffiguring
out
the
ritual
of
the
curse
spirit
vault
for
rituals
of
the
undead
i've
got
one
ii've
been
using
it
as
a
paperweight
angel
has
a
ritual
of
his
own
to
perform
before
he
can
remove
the
sword
and
awaken
acathla
with
any
luck
it
should
take
some
time
which
means
you
just
have
to
hold
angel
off
don't
let
him
close
on
you
if
the
curse
succeeds
you'll
you'll
know
quod
perditum
est
invenietur
get
out
go
