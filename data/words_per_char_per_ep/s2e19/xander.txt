something
weird
is
going
on
isn't
that
our
school
motto
i
don't
wanna
poopoo
your
wiggins
but
a
domestic
dispute
a
little
case
of
chalkboard
tourette's
all
sounds
like
hellmouth
lite
to
me
you're
just
a
big
bucket
of
funny
will
i'll
have
you
know
i
was
just
accosted
by
some
kind
of
um
locker
monster
this
was
right
after
buffy's
history
teacher
starts
doing
some
freaky
channeling
thing
in
class
oh
no
no
no
no
cool
this
was
no
wimpy
chain
rattler
this
was
'i'm
dead
as
hell
and
i'm
not
gonna
take
it
anymore'
giles
well
despite
the
xanderspeak
that's
a
fairly
accurate
definition
of
a
poltergeist
i
defined
something
accurately
fill
me
in
then
'cause
i've
read
the
book
seen
the
movie
and
i'm
still
fuzzy
about
what's
going
on
you
think
she's
the
ghost
i
know
he's
usually
investigatethingsfromeveryboringangle
guy
now
he's
iclingontomyonelameidea
guy
what
gives
dog
spit
is
cleaner
than
human
ladies
and
gentlemen
we
have
a
ghost
it
is
one
of
those
two
right
how
come
we've
never
heard
about
this
murdersuicide
thing
before
when
did
it
happen
your
dreams
are
getting
wicked
accurate
buff
you
wouldn't
happen
to
see
me
coming
across
some
big
cash
or
possibly
knowing
the
love
of
a
woman
in
a
full
body
sense
he
killed
a
person
and
killed
himself
those
are
pretty
much
two
of
the
dumbest
things
you
could
do
yikes
the
quality
of
mercy
is
not
buffy
that
tracks
okay
who's
hungry
obviously
some
hairylegged
feminist
nuke
the
school
i
like
that
this
ghost
this
james
guy
is
fixating
on
you
buffy
the
dreams
the
yearbook
you
sure
you
can
handle
it
okay
so
we
can
flip
the
ghost
over
when
it
turns
a
nice
golden
brown
oh
yeah
baby
it's
snakalicious
in
here
out
of
marrow
and
bone
check
it
i'd
say
school's
out
for
good
but
why
what
does
he
want
actually
that's
an
interesting
point
he
can't
live
with
it
buff
he's
dead
so
what
now
not
even
a
megavat
of
raid's
gonna
do
the
trick
here
so
buffy
should
be
safe
until
we
find
a
way
to
get
her
out
explain
to
me
again
how
that's
a
good
thing
