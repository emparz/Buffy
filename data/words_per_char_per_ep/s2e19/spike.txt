it's
paradise
big
windows
lovely
gardens
it'll
be
perfect
when
we
want
the
sunlight
to
kill
us
well
our
old
place
was
just
fine
till
you
went
and
had
it
burned
down
very
funny
mate
yeah
you're
a
giver
what
about
your
pretty
dress
sweet
it'll
get
all
dirty
fortunately
nobody
cares
what
you
like
mate
what
gate
pet
what
do
you
see
big
deal
he
won't
do
anything
our
man
angel
here
likes
to
talk
but
he's
not
much
for
action
all
hat
and
no
cattle
really
you
might
want
to
let
up
they
say
when
you've
drawn
blood
you've
exfoliated
oh
i
will
sooner
than
you
think
