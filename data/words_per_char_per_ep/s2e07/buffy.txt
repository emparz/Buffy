get
back
on
the
vampire
tip
here
these
guys
were
here
with
a
purpose
i
sent
him
home
he
did
bag
a
vamp
his
first
time
out
gotta
give
him
credit
for
that
who's
this
well
they
don't
make
angry
mobs
like
they
used
to
'cause
this
girl's
alive
i
saw
her
with
angel
yeah
he
is
he
said
he
killed
it
that's
the
vampire
ford
said
he
killed
sure
i
thought
once
you
were
invited
you
could
always
just
walk
in
do
we
who
is
these
days
willow
and
xander
wow
everybody's
in
it's
like
a
great
big
exciting
conspiracy
i'm
talking
about
the
people
i
trust
who's
drusilla
and
don't
lie
to
me
i'm
tired
of
it
for
what
i
can
take
it
i
can
take
the
truth
what
i
love
you
i
don't
know
if
i
trust
you
maybe
i'm
the
one
who
should
decide
and
you
made
her
a
vampire
well
i
asked
for
the
truth
ford
i'm
glad
not
busy
i
like
surprises
sure
at
nine
he
told
me
everything
it's
okay
i
will
no
it's
really
not
i'm
sorry
ford
i
just
couldn't
wait
till
tonight
i'm
rash
and
impulsive
it's
a
flaw
i'm
still
a
little
fuzzy
on
exactly
what
yours
is
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
being
a
lying
scumbag
what
do
you
want
ford
what's
this
all
about
i
don't
need
to
understand
i
just
need
to
know
you
wanna
be
a
vampire
you
know
vampires
are
a
little
picky
about
who
they
change
ov
you
were
gonna
offer
them
a
trade
yeah
well
i
still
feel
awfully
chatty
you
were
gonna
give
them
me
tonight
you
had
to
know
i'd
figure
it
out
what's
supposed
to
happen
tonight
ford
if
these
people
are
still
around
when
they
get
here
there's
gotta
be
another
way
out
of
here
at
least
let
the
other
people
go
what
i
see
is
that
right
after
the
sun
goes
down
spike
and
all
of
his
friends
are
going
to
be
pigging
out
at
the
allyoucaneat
moron
bar
i
think
you
should
try
i
am
trying
to
save
you
you
are
playing
in
some
serious
traffic
here
do
you
understand
that
you're
going
to
die
and
the
only
hope
you
have
of
surviving
this
is
to
get
out
of
this
pit
right
now
and
my
god
could
you
have
a
dorkier
outfit
no
i
don't
us
we
have
something
in
common
now
yeah
well
let
me
explain
something
to
you
you're
what
we
call
the
bad
guy
these
people
aren't
gonna
get
changed
are
they
the
rest
of
them
they're
just
fodder
well
i've
got
a
news
flash
for
you
braintrust
that's
not
how
it
works
you
die
and
a
demon
sets
up
shop
in
your
old
house
and
it
walks
and
it
talks
and
it
remembers
your
life
but
it's
not
you
and
your
life
is
nothing
ford
these
people
don't
deserve
to
die
i'm
sorry
i
had
no
idea
but
what
you're
doing
is
still
very
wrong
you
have
a
choice
you
don't
have
a
good
choice
but
you
have
a
choice
you're
opting
for
mass
murder
here
and
nothing
you
say
is
gonna
make
that
okay
i
think
this
is
all
part
of
your
little
fantasy
drama
isn't
this
exactly
how
you
imagined
it
you
tell
me
how
you've
suffered
and
i
feel
sorry
for
you
well
i
do
feel
sorry
for
you
and
if
those
vampires
come
in
here
and
start
feeding
i'll
kill
you
myself
ford
help
me
stop
this
please
people
listen
to
me
this
is
not
the
mothership
people
this
is
ugly
death
come
to
play
spike
good
idea
now
you
let
everyone
out
or
your
girlfriend
fits
in
an
ashtray
down
the
stairs
you
guys
are
just
in
time
they're
contained
they'll
get
out
eventually
though
we
should
probably
go
we
can
come
back
when
they're
gone
for
the
body
