one
of
them
i'm
going
to
i
don't
think
i
wanna
talk
anymore
yes
actually
i
was
counting
on
it
this
is
so
cool
it's
just
like
it
played
in
my
head
you
know
that
part
where
you
ask
me
what's
supposed
to
happen
it's
already
happening
rigged
up
special
once
it's
closed
it
can
only
be
opened
from
the
outside
as
soon
as
the
sun
sets
they'll
be
comin'
this
is
the
end
buffy
no
one
gets
outta
here
alive
this
is
a
bomb
shelter
buffy
i
knew
i
wasn't
gonna
be
able
to
overpower
you
but
this
is
three
feet
of
solid
concrete
trust
me
when
i
say
we're
in
for
the
long
haul
i
gotta
back
her
up
d
you
look
like
a
big
ninny
627
sunset
hey
you
never
give
up
do
you
that's
a
good
quality
in
a
person
too
many
people
they
just
lay
back
and
take
it
but
us
more
than
you
think
i
guess
i
am
technically
yes
but
i'm
in
i
will
become
immortal
it's
better
than
nothing
well
neither
do
i
but
apparently
no
one
took
that
into
consideration
'cause
i'm
still
dying
i
look
good
don't
i
well
let
me
tell
you
something
i've
got
maybe
six
months
left
and
by
then
what
they
bury
won't
even
look
like
me
it'll
be
bald
and
shriveled
and
it'll
smell
bad
no
i'm
not
going
out
that
way
i'm
sorry
summers
did
i
screw
up
your
righteous
anger
riff
okay
well
you
try
vomiting
for
twentyfour
hours
straight
because
the
pain
in
your
head
is
so
intense
and
then
we'll
discuss
the
concept
of
right
and
wrong
these
people
are
sheep
they
wanna
be
vampires
'cause
they're
lonely
miserable
or
bored
i
don't
have
a
choice
you
think
i
need
to
justify
myself
to
you
you
know
what
summers
i
really
did
miss
you
what
happened
buffy
