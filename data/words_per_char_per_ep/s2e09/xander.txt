introduce
too
many
variables
into
their
mushroom
head
numbercrunching
little
world
no
it's
just
these
people
can't
tell
from
one
multiplechoice
test
what
we're
gonna
be
doing
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
it's
ridiculous

and
suck
all
the
spontaneity
out
of
being
young
and
stupid

rather
live
in
the
dark

always
ready
to
give
a
helping
hand
to
the

between
you
and
your
god
yup
high
risk
subminimum

kind
of
attitude

a
bright
future

an
employee
at
the
dmv
motivational
speaker
on
what
ten
ways
to
a
more
annoying
you

you
know
me
about

well
as
anyone
else
maybe
even
better
than
i
know
myself
when
you
look
at
me
do
you
think
'prison
guard'
they
just
put
up
the
assignments
for
the
career
fair
and
according
to
my
test
results
i
can
look
forward
to
being
gainfully
employed
in
the
growing
field
of
corrections
ha
ha
ha
ha
laugh
now
missy
they
assigned
you
to
the
booth
for
law
enforcement
professionals
as
in
polyester
doughnuts
and
brutality
i
did
and
you
weren't
on
the
list

i
guess
you

passed
your
name

went
with
giles
about
an
hour
ago
some
kind
of
field
trip
deal
principal
snyder
great
career
fair
sir
really
in
fact
i'm
so
inspired
by
your
leadership
i'm
thinking
principal
school
i
wanna
walk
in
your
shoes
not
your
actual
shoes
of
course
because
you're
a
tiny
person
not
tiny
in
the
small
sense
of
course
okay
i'm
done
now
for
what
it's
worth
well
i'm
glad
you
feel
comfortable
enough
to
be
so
honest
with
me
and
i
can
only
hope
that
one
day
i'm
in
the
position
to
be
that
honest
with
you
well
love
to
stay
and
chat
but
i
got
an
appointment
with
the
warden
on
standard
riot
procedure
ciao
so
why
go
to
all
the
trouble
of
inventing
something
and
then
giving
it
a
weak
name
like
that
i
mean
i'da
gone
with
'the
crosso
matic'
or
uh
'the
amazing
mr
cross'
a
fear
we'll
soon
get
to
experience
for
ourselves
up
close
and
personal
will
you
need
a
life
in
the
worst
way
that's
untrue
buffy
you
totally
contribute
you
go
for
snacks
but
hohos
are
a
vital
part
of
my
cognitive
process
and
didn't
they
beat
the
elks
this
year
in
the
sunnydale
adult
bowling
league
championships
bowling
is
a
vicious
game
well
she
didn't
go
home
i
let
the
phone
ring
a
few
hundred
times
before
i
remembered
her
mom
is
out
of
town
no
it's
a
statistical
impossibility
for
a
sixteenyearold
girl
to
unplug
her
phone
ya
think
that's
what
a
lot
of
the
guys
say
but
it's
just
locker
room
talk
i
wouldn't
pay
it
any
mind
i
like
to
think
of
you
more
as
my
witless
foil
but
have
it
your
way
buffy
c'mon
cordelia
you
wanna
be
a
member
of
the
scooby
gang
you
gotta
be
willing
to
be
inconvenienced
every
now
and
then
buffy
could
be
in
trouble
well
at
least
i'm
the
lameness
who
cares
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
about
you
buffy
i'm
gonna
check
upstairs
buffy
