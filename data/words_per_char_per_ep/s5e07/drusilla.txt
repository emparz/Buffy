and
i
wonder
what
possible
catastrophe
came
crashing
down
from
heaven
and
brought
this
dashing
stranger
to
tears
oh
i
see
you
a
man
surrounded
by
fools
who
cannot
see
his
strength
his
vision
his
glory
that
and
burning
baby
fish
swimming
all
around
your
head
don't
need
a
purse
your
wealth
lies
here
and
here
in
the
spirit
and
imagination
you
walk
in
worlds
the
others
can't
begin
to
imagine
i
see
what
you
want
something
glowing
and
glistening
something
effulgent
do
you
want
it
the
king
of
cups
expects
a
picnic
but
this
is
not
his
birthday
oh
spike
look
at
the
wonderful
mess
you've
made
that's
a
slayer
you've
done
in
naughty
wicked
spike
may
i
tell
my
little
spike
just
killed
himself
a
slayer
i
smell
fear
it's
intoxicating
why
can't
you
kill
her
but
you're
lying
i
can
still
see
her
floating
all
around
you
laughing
why
why
won't
you
push
her
away
i
have
to
find
my
pleasures
spike
you
taste
like
ashes
you
can't
blame
the
ghoul
spike
you're
all
covered
with
her
i
look
at
you
all
i
see
is
the
slayer
