oh
leave
me
alone
you
and
i
i'm
going
to
ask
you
a
very
personal
question
and
i
demand
an
honest
answer
do
you
understand
your
poetry
it's
they're
not
written
about
me
are
they
yes
but
are
they
about
me
oh
god
please
stop
i
do
see
you
that's
the
problem
you're
nothing
to
me
william
you're
beneath
me
