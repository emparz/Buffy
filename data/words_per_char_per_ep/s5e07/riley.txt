buffy
what
happened
oh
yeah
i
like
a
girl
who
can
play
a
few
hard
sets
of
tennis
with
a
major
stab
wound
i
said
i've
seen
worse
there's
a
difference
i
still
think
you
need
to
see
a
real
doctor
so
tell
me
about
the
bad
guy
or
guys
what
do
you
think
they
were
how
many
so
what
he
was
like
a
supervampire
or
something
that
ever
happen
before
hey
mrs
summers
how're
you
feeling
glad
to
hear
it
so
dawn
takes
household
duty
i'll
take
tonight's
patrol
just
a
sweep
okay
i
will
patrol
with
the
group
tonight
it
means
yell
real
loud
so
the
vampires
who
don't
know
we're
coming
will
have
a
sporting
chance
guys
i'm
thinking
if
we
split
up
we
could
cover
more
ground
tell
you
what
i'll
take
the
cemeteries
you
guys
get
the
bronze
okay
just
ditch
the
chips
and
watch
my
back
guys
that's
him
let's
go
forget
about
crashing
there's
too
many
of
them
we'll
come
back
at
daybreak
when
they're
asleep
and
we're
better
armed
it's
okay
we
can
kill
them
just
as
dead
in
the
morning
you
know
what
they
put
in
museums
mostly
dead
things
