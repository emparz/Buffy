perhaps
it's
my
advancing
years
that
makes
me
so
forgetful
william
remind
me
why
don't
we
kill
you
what's
that
i'm
not
your
mate
and
when
did
you
start
talking
like
that
you've
got
me
and
my
women
hiding
in
the
luxury
of
a
mine
shaft
all
because
william
the
bloody
likes
the
attention
this
is
not
a
reputation
we
need
all
the
more
reason
to
use
a
certain
amount
of
finesse
and
every
time
you
do
we
become
the
hunted
that's
a
brilliant
strategy
really
pure
cunning
no
a
real
kill
a
good
kill
it
takes
pure
artistry
without
that
we're
just
animals
you
can't
keep
this
up
forever
if
i
can't
teach
you
maybe
someday
an
angry
crowd
will
that
or
the
slayer
