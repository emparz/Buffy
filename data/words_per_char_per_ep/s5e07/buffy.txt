you
know
it's
probably
none
of
my
business
but
i
just
gotta
ask
you
smell
this
bad
when
you
were
alive
'cause
if
it's
a
postmortem
thing
then
boy
is
my
face
red
but
just
so
you
know
the
fastgrowing
field
of
personal
grooming
has
come
a
long
way
since
you
became
a
vampire
i
can't
believe
i
passed
out
do
you
think
i'm
a
total
wuss
now
you
said
it
wasn't
that
bad
well
at
least
no
major
organs
got
kebabed
that
would
put
me
in
a
real
hospital
which
would
get
my
real
mom
real
freaked
out
i
can't
do
it
don't
worry
accelerated
healing
powers
come
with
the
slayer
package
and
the
boyfriend
who
comes
complete
with
combat
medical
training
that's
just
a
buffy
summers
bonus
vampire
one
no
he
was
the
regular
kind
he
just
beat
me
i'm
in
the
best
physical
shape
of
my
life
i
mean
if
you're
asking
how
it
happened
i
don't
dawn
you
got
it
huh
oh
uh
you
are
a
very
short
annoying
man
if
i
show
you
something
you
promise
you
won't
tell
and
mom
cannot
know
okay
you'll
help
me
with
the
household
stuff
by
yourself
do
me
a
favor
will
you
take
the
gang
along
with
not
until
you're
never
good
let's
hope
she'll
be
more
helpful
than
this
last
one
same
as
all
the
others
slayer
called
blah
blah
great
protector
blah
blah
scary
battles
blah
blah
oops
she's
dead
where
are
the
details
gotta
love
a
gal
with
an
anvil
but
where
are
the
details
of
the
slayer's
last
battle
you
know
what
made
that
fight
special
why
did
she
lose
got
really
close
i
slipped
up
giles
i've
been
training
harder
than
ever
and
still
i
and
there's
nothing
in
any
of
these
books
to
help
me
understand
why
i
mean
look
i
realize
that
every
slayer
comes
with
an
expiration
mark
on
the
package
but
i
want
mine
to
be
a
long
time
from
now
like
a
cheeto
if
there
were
just
a
few
good
descriptions
of
what
took
out
the
other
slayers
maybe
it
would
help
me
to
understand
my
mistake
to
keep
it
from
happening
again
it's
okay
to
use
the
dword
giles
why
didn't
the
watchers
keep
fuller
accounts
of
it
the
journals
just
stop
unseemly
damn
love
ya
but
you
watchers
are
such
prigs
sometimes
don't
even
start
spike
slayers
you
killed
two
of
them
you're
gonna
show
me
how
update
spike
we're
not
here
to
discuss
the
fine
choice
of
hops
it's
about
two
slayers

one
in
china
during
the
boxer
rebellion
one
in
new
york
both
got
killed
by
you
tell
the
tale
you
get
the
cash
that's
not
what
i
what
excuse
me
don't
get
all
excited
i'm
fine
just
tell
me
what
i
want
to
know
were
you
born
this
big
a
pain
in
the
ass
so
you
traded
up
on
the
food
chain
then
what
so
how'd
you
kill
her
you
got
off
on
it
not
enough
and
that
would
be
what
not
really
i
just
know
i
can
handle
myself
so
that's
it
lesson
over
give
it
to
me
what
what's
the
difference
how'd
you
kill
the
second
one
that
didn't
hurt
yeah
this
hurt
too
how'd
you
kill
'em
spike
i'm
ready
you
think
we're
dancing
get
out
of
my
sight
now
i
mean
it
spike
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
say
it's
true
say
i
do
want
to
it
wouldn't
be
you
spike

would
never
be
you

beneath
me

together
that
grocery
list
for
you

under
the
sink
