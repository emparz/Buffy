not
that
i'm
knocking
the
nacho
cheese
ones
i
like
the
taste
it's
just
the
texture
i
can't
deal
with
so
gritty
kinda
hurts
my
tongue
so
i'd
give
'em
a
seven
maybe
a
sevenfive

and
you
think
this
is
dumb
don't
you
i
can
be
a
real
boredombuster
if
you
just
give
me
half
a
chance
still
i
feel
responsible
it's
not
fair

girl
your
age
cooped
up
in
a
crypt

you
what
let
me
get
my
hat
and
coat

take
you
to
a
movie

go
nuts
pgthirteen

if
there's
anything
i
can
do
to
help

name
it
ohh

you're
not
going
to
get
yourself
in
trouble
now
are
you
or
me
'cause
your
sister's
the
slayer

a
demon

real
good
incentive
to
get
along
with
her
spike's
gone
oh
huh
i
don't
feel
anything
oh
well
not
here
let's
go
home
know
why
rack
moves
all
the
time
because
he's
shady
a
bad
element
comes
down
here
we
in
a
face
to
face
way
no
no
it's
fine
i'm
good
it's
just
rack
isn't
partial
to
the
floppyeared
he
has
a
thing
but
but
hey
i'm
in
absolutely
say
rack
does
know
where
willow
is
he's
not
going
to
tell
you
for
nothing
he's
gonna
want
something
that's
not
the
kind
of
something
he's
gonna
want
rack
likes
little
girls
i
i
don't
know
if
you've
thought
this
through
i'm
supposed
to
keep
you
safe
and
this
whole
thing
is
i
mean
even
if
you
find
willow

you
really
think
you
can
stop
her
it's
not
very
clean
it's
just
i'm
still
not
so
sure
you
should
be
here
i'm
not
so
sure
i
should
be
here
if
that
works
for
you
