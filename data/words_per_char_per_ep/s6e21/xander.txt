i
think
i'm
gonna
be
sick
i
know
it's
just

what
happened
back
there
the
sounds
of
it
the
smell
willow
did
that
you
don't
think
she's
gonna
kill
them
too
she
wouldn't
it
doesn't
make
sense
longer
than
what
right
vengeance
demon
well
at
least
she'll
get
there
first
well
anya
can
handle
herself
well

she
should
be
coming
down
at
some
point
shouldn't
she
i
mean
back
there
she
was
out
of
her
head

running
on
grief
and
magicks
warren
was
a
coldblooded
killer
of
women
just
warming
up
you
ask
me
that
bastard
had
it
coming
to
him
this
is
still
willow
we're
dealing
with
right
willow
sure
how
are
you
gonna
okay
then
i'll
just

catch
up
she's
only
my
best
friend
you
know
no
big
deal
just
glad
i
could
help
get
in
i
don't
see
anything
boys
if
you
don't
knock
it
off
i
will
pull
this
car
over
and
you
can
just
walk
to
your
painful
deaths
from
here
hate
to
admit
it
buff
but
jonathan
may
have
a
point
why
isn't
she
right
here
right
now
guess
we
keep
running
then
just
willow
ookay
any
ideas
this
is
faster
she's
whating
thanks
anya
for
getting
here
so
fast
it's
a
big
help
whatever
so
can
you
still
sense
willow
knowing
her
location'd
be
a
real
big
comfort
right
about
now
did
i
mention
me
needing
the
comfort
and
i
could
smack
you
so
hard
your
eyeballs
would
switch
sockets
buffy
no
one
is
getting
killed
sit
down
took
everything
what
is
it
think
you
can
work
this
stuff
i
think
willow's
in
a
league
of
her
own
about
now
dabbleboy
buffy
let's
say
this
works
and
we
stop
willow
from
working
the
hoodoo
for
a
minute
what
then
great
and
say
what
how
am
i
supposed
to
read
well
how's
the
translation
coming
hat
have
we
got
so
far
great
babylonian
thanks
a
bushel
but
unless
you
can
read
babylonian
why
don't
you
sit
back
down
hey
now
play
nice
fellas
or
you'll
break
our
concentration
and
willow
will
make
you
two
boneless
chickens
skinless
too
you've
never
had
any
tiny
bit
of
sex
have
you
she
won't
we're
her
friends
anya
her
family
she
would
never
hurt
us
guess
you
two
finally
have
something
in
common
again
with
the
comfort
look
we
both
know
things
might
get
ugly
at
uh
wiccapalooza
and
if
it
gets
really
bad
i
need
to
know
if
you're
gonna
turn
on
me
use
this
little
shindig
as
an
excuse
for
some
sweet
revenge
right
'cause
you
varnishing
the
table
with
spike
how
could
that
possibly
have
hurt
it
may
have
chafed
if
that's
what
you
need
to
do
i'm
not
you
think
i
don't
know
that
you
think
i'm
the
hero
of
this
piece
i
saw
the
gun
before
warren
raised
it
i

i
saw
it
and
i
couldn't
move
he
shot
two
of
my
friends

before
i
could
even
you
want
me
to
know
how
useless
i
am
that
it's
my
fault
thanks

got
the
memo

don't
let's
go
buffy
can
handle
her

that's
why
we're
leaving

but
i
don't
know
if
you
wanna
keep
breathing
you
gotta
keep
moving

just
gotta
find
a
place
to
hide
you
