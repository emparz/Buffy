lifts
her

with
the

shot
of

sitting
on

both
leaning
against
the
counter
looking
weak

continues
throwing
magic
across
the

at
the
geeks
who
are
scared
but
untouched
reveal
anya
in
a
hidden
nook
around
the
corner
holding
the
magic
book
and
muttering
in
sumerian
or
possibly
babylonian
she
looks
nervously
around
the
corner
and
we
can
see
the
light
from
willow's
magic
illuminating
anya
she
looks
back
down
at
the

continuously
chanting

bends
her
head
and
mutters
something
in
latin
more
swirling
magic
and
crackles
of
lightning
just
around
