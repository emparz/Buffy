trade
a
pack
of
cigarettes
in
for
tin

nice
antenna

girlfriend's
pathetic
over
so

how
far
it's
gotten
you
checking
every
hole
in
your
sad
little
body
for
transmitters
that
don't
exist

off
what's
going
on
um

you're
gonna
have
to
break
this
down
for
us
a
little
oh
my
god

me
guard
guard
yes
we
did
we
signed
on
we
teamed
up
we
wanted
to
see
where
our
plans
would
take
us
well
take
a
look
this
is
it
i
i
don't
think
so
i
don't
believe
this
i
don't
get
it
willow's
a
witch
why
doesn't
she
just

you
know
wave
her
arms
and
make
us
dead
i
still
can't
believe
that
was
willow
i
mean
i've
known
her
almost
as
long
as
you
guys
willow
was

you
know
she
packed
her
own
lunches
and
wore
floods
and
was
always
just
willow
geez
it
she
knows
you're
in
this
car
too
right
right
she's
draining
just
keep
going
could
i
take
a
look
at
it
right
i
just
thought
you
know
as
long
as
you're
protecting
us
the
least
i
could
do
is
buffy
i'm
not
protecting
you
jonathan
none
of
us
are
we're
doing
this
for
willow
the
only
reason
it
happens
to
be
your
lucky
day
is
because
willow
kills
you
she
crosses
a
line
i
lose
a
friend
and
i
hate
losing
i
get
that
it's
just

you
know
she's
running
out
of
power
right
i
can
tell
i
can
practically
feel
it
i've
dabbled
in
the
magicks
but
still
running
that
hot
for
that
long
it's
just
a
matter
of
time
before
you
gotta
recharge
no
matter
how
juiced
up
you
are
about
me
shutting
up
right
i'm
pretty
sure
it's
babylonian
the
text
is
similar
but
the
dialect
is
completely
different
because
they're
saving
our
lives
you
moron
so
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
and
do
what
you
want
an
order
grow
up
we're
alive
let's
get
out
of
here
what
about
willow
like
where

more
