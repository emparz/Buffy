witch
at
her
level

can
only
go
airborne

a
thing

it
does
take
longer
teleporting

you
out
of
here
or

and
being
the
most
powerful
wicca
in
the
western
hemisphere
decided
to
get
the
payback
with
interest
she
killed
him
ripped
him
apart
and
bloodied
up
the
forest
doing
it
now
she's
coming
here
and
the
two
of
you
are
next
something's
coming
something
bad
you
have
to
let
these
men
out
of
here
or
i
guarantee
you
there
will
be
hell
to
pay
one
of
the
many
things
in
this
world
you
are
not
prepared
to
deal
with
yes
and
we're
running
out
of
time
so
just
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
these
things
are
real
they're
dangerous
and
they're
coming
so
please
stop
looking
at
me
like
it's
your
first
trip
to
the
circus
and
do
your
job
let
them
out
are
you
even
listening
this
is
the
one
place
they
won't
be
safe
i
can't
it
doesn't
work
that
way
willow

just
stop
for
a
second
and
listen
to
once
again
xander
in
need
of
the
big
help
no
i
can't
which
means
whatever
she's
feeling
it's
gone
way
beyond
simple
vengeance
not
everything
um
book
of
protection
spells
antimagic
our
last
resort
ah
okay
well
the
good
news
is
text
is
intact
bad
news
is
ah
i
can't
read
a
word
of
it
it's
like
in
ancient
sumerian
or
something
you're
too
close
i
don't
know
i'm
staring
right
at
this
stuff
and
i
can't
read
it
so
far
we've
got
the
well
either
the
or
towards
i'm
not
really
sure
i
can't
do
this
i'm
in
retail
stupid
ancient
sumerian
which
means
no
protection
spell
the
annoying
virgin
has
a
point
what
if
willow
fillets
their
soles
and
then
comes
after
us
you
don't
know
that
she
tried
to
use
you
for
a
hood
ornament
xander
she
doesn't
care
if
you
live
or
die
i
care
if
you
live
or
die
xander
i'm
just
not
sure
which
one
i
want
let
me
guess
you'll
propose
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
that
could
give
me
greater
or
more
lasting
satisfaction
than
to
reap
bloody
vengeance
upon
you
xander
harris
but
i
can't
not
officially
not
magically

so
smile
it's
your
lucky
day
you
got
away
with
it
i
can't
hurt
you
that
wasn't
vengeance
it
was
solace
look

i
really
can't
hurt
you
so
i'm
just
gonna
have
to
settle
for
hating
you
don't
you
don't
get
to
play
the
martyr
you
know
none
of
this
would
be
happening
if
it
weren't
for
you
i
was
talking
about
us
i
can't
i
i
have
to
stay
here
to
keep
the
spell
going
on
willow
go
do
something
right
help
me
help
me
you're
hurting
me
