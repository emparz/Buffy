some

mystic
ball
of
energy

why
you're
crying
all
the
time

constant
whining

my
way
i'm
doing
fine
on
my
own
thanks
don't
we're
all
friends
let
me
tell
you
something
about
willow
she's
a
loser
and
she
always
has
been
people
picked
on
willow
in
junior
high
school
high
school
up
until
college
with
her
stupid
mousy
ways
and
now
willow's
a
junkie
the
only
thing
willow
was
ever
good
for
the
only
thing
i
had
going
for
me

were
the
moments

just
moments

when
tara
would
look
at
me
and
i
was
wonderful
and
that
will
never
happen
again
promise
why
not
oh
please
this
is
your
pitch
buffy
you
hate
it
here
as
much
as
i
do
i'm
just
more
honest
about
it
you're
trying
to
sell
me
on
the
world
the
one
where
you
lie
to
your
friends
when
you're
not
trying
to
kill
them
and
you
screw
a
vampire
just
to
feel
and
insane
asylums
are
the
comfy
alternative
this
world
buffy
it's
me
i
know
you
were
happier
when
you
were
in
the
ground
the
only
time
you
were
ever
at
peace
in
your
whole
life
is
when
you
were
dead
until
willow
brought
you
back
you
know
with
magic
oh
sorry
the
trip
can
be
kind
of
rough
if
you're
you
know

not
me
jonathan
andrew
you
boys
like
magic
don't
you
abracadabra
okay
didn't
see
that
coming
you
guys
want
to
take
it
slow
i
can
do
that
too
ask
warren
no
no
stay
i
mean
we're
just
getting
started
i've
got
big
party
plans
guys
come
on
i'm
just
getting
wood
for
the
violence
here
and
you
know
what
they
say

if
at
first
you
don't
succeed
damn
that
is
one
effective
counterspell
won't
keep
you
alive
though
i
get
it
you
boys
put
a
a
spell
on
yourselves
didn't
you
protecting
you
from
harm

from
magicks
that's
cute
how
'bout
i
back
off
right
after
so
which
one
of
you
boys
worked
the
mojo
doesn't
matter
really
i'm
just
curious
just
because
i
can't
do
magicks
to
you
doesn't
mean
i
can't
do
them
on
myself
now
i'm
pretty
sure
i'm
strong
enough
to
beat
you
to
death
not
a
problem
no
so
here
we
are
come
on
this
is
a
huge
deal
for
me
six
years
as
a
side
man
and
now
i
get
to
be
the
slayer
oh
buffy
you
really
need
to
have
every
square
inch
of
your
ass
kicked
get
off
superbitch
i
thought
you
were
gonna
show
me
what
a
slayer
was
well
hey
isn't
that
interesting
anya's
still
here
looks
like
i've
been
beating
on
the
wrong
gal
you
can't
block
my
spells
if
you
can't
chant
and
you
can't
chant
if
you're
sleepin'
buffy

i
gotta
tell
ya

i
get
it
now
the
slayer
thing
really
isn't
about
the
violence
it's
about
the
power
and
there's
no
one
in
the
world
with
the
power
to
stop
me
now
