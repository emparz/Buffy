meet
at
last
mister
drippy
no
yes
dawn
i'm
on
it
okay
ah
there
all
better
you
were
right
the
plumber
will
make
everything
good
dawn
breakfast
is
the
most
important
meal
of
the
day
it's
unbelievably
important
you
should
eat
breakfast
at
least
three
times
a
day
thank
you
so
we'll
pay
him
what's
the
big
deal
lying
flat
on
my
back
okay

so
you're
telling
me
i'm
broke
but
i
haven't
spent
any
money
i
was
all

dead
and
frugal
how
am
i
doing
that
easy
we
burn
the
house
to
the
ground
and
collect
the
insurance
plus
fire
pretty
you
guys
i'm
kidding
okay
it's
it's
bills
it's
money
it's
pieces
of
paper
sent
by
bureaucrats
that
we've
never
even
met
it's
not
like
it's
the
end
of
the
world
which
is
too
bad
you
know
'cause
that
i'm
really
good
at
i'll
take
care
of
this
i
promise
i

just
don't
know
how
yet
for
what
well
that's
an
idea

you
would
have
any
other
suggestions
this
is
my
first
big
loan
stupid
skirt
hello
buffy
summers
loan
applierfor
i
i
didn't
know
exactly
what
you
would
need
so
um
i
brought
everything
i'm
very
responsible
in
that
way
so

about
my
getting
a
loan
i
know
and
i
figured
you
could
just
you
know
cut
through
that
tangle
with
scissors
you
know
where
the
loan
is
the
scissors
are
you
saying
you
won't
give
me
my
loan
no
job
i
wish
hey
are
you
in
the
wrong
line
that's
for
deposits
that's
for
withdrawals
and
this
one

is
for
getting
kicked
in
the
face
stupid
skirt
may
i
these
things
never
helpful
now
about
my
loan
i'm
not
saying
i'm
charging
you
for
saving
your
life
or
anything
but

let's
talk
rates
you're
asking
the
wrong
gal
you
noticed
it'll
pass
well

that's
good
then
it's
gone
now
and
you
know
i
really
doubt
it
will

what
the
hell
are
you
doing
yes
true
why
what
do
you
mean
you
do
research
now
want
a
cappuccino
and
a
pack
of
cigarettes
to
go
with
it
maybe
they
turned
down
his
loan
application
that's
him
big
bad
this
thing
was
strong
guys
no
weapons
that
i
could
see
but


still

real

dangerous
huh
oh
sorry
i
take
a
little
getting
used
to
i'm
still
getting
used
to
me
a
miracle
i
can
start
how
was
england
how
was

life
always
a
good
time
and
now
you're
back
wow
giles
are
you
miserable
about
it
or
just
really
british
i'm
guessing
the
word
is
inconvenient
me
nah
fine
i
mean
yeah
you
know
sleeping's
hard
but

just
because
of
the
whole
waking
up
in
a
box
thing
so
maybe
waking
up's
the
problem
you
know
but
just
for
a
second
i
sleep
okay
great
even
except
you
know
for
the
dreams

well
actually
it
wasn't
me
willow
brought
me
back
i
just
lay
there
well
i
i
uh
better
start
prepping
the
slayage
seems
that
way
i
know
they're

so
cute
you
could
die
but
it's
all
i
got
they
were
mine
when
i
was
little
couldn't
find
the
guest
sheets
mom
always
did
this
stuff
they
don't
actually
fit
i
blame
the
sofa
we
need
one
of
those
pullout
kinds
the
kind
with
no
payments
'til
twothousandandinfinity
oh
it's

just
money
stuff
it
turns
out

mom
left
me
some
and
while
i
was
dead
it
got
squandered
on
luxuries
like

food
and
clothing
anya
says
pretty
bad
i'm
kinda
taking
her
word
for
it
actually
i'm
kinda
trying
to
not
think
about
it
figured
i'd
put
it
out
of
my
mind
you
know
take
a
break
get
some
perspective

and
then
wake
up
at
four
am
terrified
in
the
meantime
i'm
scaring
people
i
guess
i'm
glad
you're
back
hello
spike
just
enough
to
make
me
feel
crappy
i
guess
everyone

they
all
care
they
all
care
so
much
it

makes
it
all
harder
i
don't
know
i
just
i
feel
like
i'm
spending
all
of
my
time
trying
to
be
okay
so
they
don't
worry
it's
exhausting
and
then
i
why
are
you
always
around
when
i'm
miserable
me
neither
so
what
do

know
about
finances
you're
payin'
