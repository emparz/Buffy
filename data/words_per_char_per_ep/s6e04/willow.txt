it's
like
little
clown
cars
in
the
circus
full
copper
repipe
that
sounds
potentially
pricey
um

buffy
ii
know
you're
still
getting
back
on
your
feet
after
yeah
uh
but
there's
some
money
stuff
we're
gonna
have
to
talk
to
you
about
not
yet
but

ii
know
this
comes
as
a
bit
of
a
shock
after

a
bit
of
a
shock
but

it
took
us
by
surprise
too
pretty
much
sucked
up
all
the
money
you're
throwin'
away
a
gold
mine
he
still
turned
you
down
that's
crazy
i
mean
even
if
the
bank
did
get
robbed
which
you
battling
demons
couldn't
possibly
know

you
would
think
there
would
be
some
kind
of
reward
but
no
they're
like
oh
we're
not
gonna
give
you
money
unless
you
prove
you
don't
need
it
i
mean
what
kind
of
system
is
that
hey
buffy
you're
mad
no
anger

is
a
big
powerful
emotion
you
should
feel
okay

uh
let
me
make
you
mad
again
uh

ready
um

last
semester
i
slept
with
riley
caught
me
big
fib
to

cover
up
the
sleazy
affair
i
had
with
angel
pissing
you
off
well
'cause
you
know
since
you've

been
back
you
haven't
exactly
been
big
with

the
whole
range
of
human
emotions
thing
well
you
haven't

no
i
mean
it's
just
um

you
know
this
is
really

my
problem
i'm
just
i'm
all
over
the
place
and
you
should
just
uh
forget
i
even
said
anything
cause
cause
well
'cause
you
know
banks
man
this
one
robs
banks
hey
giles
you
have
a
good
talk
with
buffy
isn't
it
awesome
oh
okay
first
of
all
so
scary
like
the
blair
witch
would
have
had
to
watch
like
this
and
and
and
this
giant
snake
came
out
my
mouth
and
there
was
all
this
energy
crackling
and
this
pack
of
demons
interrupted
but
i
totally
kept
it
together
and
then
the
next
thing
you
know
buffy
what
giles
i
thought
you'd
be

impressed
or
or
something
are
you
saying
you
don't
trust
me
i
brought
her
back
risk
of
what
making
her
deader
no
giles
i
did
what
i
had
to
do
i
did
what
nobody
else
could
do
no
probably
not
but

well
they're
the
bad
guys
i'm
not
a
bad
guy
i
brought
buffy
back
into
this
world
aand
maybe
the
word
you
should
be
looking
for
is
congratulations
that's
not
what
i
did
giles
i
wasn't
lucky
i
was
amazing
and
how
would
you
know
you
weren't
even
there
you're
right
the
magicks
i
used
are
very
powerful
i'm
very
powerful
and
maybe
it's
not
such
a
good
idea
for
you
to
piss
me
off
come
on
giles
ii
don't
want
to
fight
