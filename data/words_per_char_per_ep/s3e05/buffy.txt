that

even
thinking
about
college
aand
i'm
involved
with
someone
his
name
is
scott
he's
a
nice
solid
guy
he
makes
me
happy
and
that's
what
i
need

someone
i
can
count
on

i'm
getting
better
honest
in
fact
from

drastic
distraction

'drastic
distraction
reduction'
try

not
ms
moran
hi
i'm
so
glad
that
i
ran
into
you
um
i
had
this
little
incident
last
year
of
getting
kicked
out
of
school
and
i'm
back
now
though
i've
done
all
of
my
makeup
tests
but
i
still
need
one
written
recommendation
from
a
teacher
i
think
the
word
that
principal
snyder
used
was
'glowing'
uh
to
put
in
my
file
so
i
can
prove
that
i
belong
here
buffy
bbuffy
summers
third
row
i
sat
by
the
window
uh
your
class
contemporary
american
heroes
from
amelia
earhart
to
maya
angelou
the
class
that
changed
my
life
buffy
i
can't
believe
it
my
favorite
teacher
and
she
didn't
even
remember
who
i
was
i'm
like
a
nonperson
am
i
invisible
can
you
see
me
at
hemery
i
was
prom
princess
i
was
fiesta
queen
i
was
on
the
cheerleading
squad
and
the
yearbook
was
like
a
story
of
me
now
it's
senior
year
and
i'm
going
to
be
one
crappy
picture
on
oneeighth
of
one
crappy
page
what
do
you
mean
when
why
i'm
not
voting
for
you
how
come
you
didn't
tell
me
they
were
doing
the
yearbook
pictures
it's
just
you
could've
thought
about
somebody
else
for
thirty
seconds
that's
all
oh
yeah
campaigning
rough
gig
obviously
it
involves
handing
out
entirely
lame
flyers
you
would
then
you
will
i'm
gonna
show
you
how
it's
done
i'm
gonna
run
for
homecoming
queen
and
i'm
going
to
win
sorry
cordy
but
you
have
no
idea
who
you're
messing
with
i'm
not
talking
about
the
slayer
i'm
talking
about
buffy
a
campaign
is
like
a
war
it's
won
or
lost
in
the
trenches
holly
michelle
and
our
real
competition
cordelia
all
have
big
head
starts
speaking
of
big
heads
if
i
had
a
watermelon
as
big
as
cordelia's
i'd
be
rich
waits
for
laugh
okay
you're
right
making
fun
of
the
competition
only
makes
me
seem
petty
now
this
is
just
like
any
other
popularity
contest
i've
done
this
before
the
only
difference
being
this
time
i'm
not
actually
popular
although
i'm
not
exactly
unpopular
a
lot
of
people
came
to
my
welcome
home
party
good
point
okay
here's
the
plan
willow
i
need
you
to
make
a
database
see
who's
for
us
who's
on
the
fence
and
where
our
real
crisis
areas
are
oz
you
take
the
fringe
musicians
those
not
normally
inclined
to
vote
xander
what
uh
cordelia
okay
look
i
know
this
is
a
little
awkward
but
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
we
all
can't
get
along
during
this
campaign
time
i
mean
we're
almost
friends
and
we
are
all
riding
together
in
the
limo
well
you
know
it's
no
fun
if
you
don't
try
your
best
sure
it's
not
like
anyone
takes
it
that
seriously
sorry
uh
yeah
it's
just
something
to
pass
the
time
no
i
don't
want
you
to
feel
thank
you
hey
willow
it's
okay
that
you're
helping
cordelia
we're
best
friends
i'm
not
gonna
hold
it
against
you
and
i'm
sure
they're
more
important
than
all
we've
been
through
together
or
the
number
of
times
that
i've
saved
your
life
fifteen
minutes
alone
on
your
computer
with
cordelia's
database
good
oh
so
i
spoke
to
the
limo
people
and
we're
all
set
they'll
pick
up
faith
then
me
then
swing
by
and
get
you
guys
now
what's
your
database
tell
you
about
my
weaknesses
you
know
jonathon
i've
always
felt
a
special
bond
between
you
and
me
so
you
really
are
giving
out
money
huh
yes
i
was
never
trying
to
be
like
you
and
when
was
it
funny
how
can
you
think
it's
okay
to
talk
to
people
like
this
do
you
have
parents
your
brain
isn't
even
connected
to
your
mouth
is
it
don't
ever
do
that
again
vapid
whore
what's
going
on
here
where's
faith
well
they
bought
us
corsages
okay
i'm
not
making
a
big
deal
you
wanted
the
orchid
you
got
the
orchid
it
does
have
that
sallow
tint
finally
we're
here
what's
massively
wrong
with
this
picture
get
down
that's
gotta
smart
now
i
can
let
you
out
of
that
or
i
can
put
a
bullet
in
your
head
how
many
are
there
in
this
little
game
and
what
are
they
packing
that
everybody
we
should
be
safe
in
here
for
a
while
you
need
to
find
a
weapon
yeah
you
are
if
you
just
stand
there
yes
you
are
we
are
gonna
get
out
of
here
and
we
are
gonna
head
back
to
the
library
where
giles
and
the
rest
of
the
weapons
live
then
i'm
gonna
take
out
the
rest
of
these
guys
just
in
time
for
you
to
congratulate
me
on
my
sweeping
victory
as
homecoming
queen
you
really
love
xander
that's
it
a
telephone
and
you
didn't
think
that'd
be
helpful
if
you
get
this
message
giles
get
help
and
get
out
here
hello
it
went
dead
giles
it's
me
and
cordelia

in
a
cabin
in
miller's
woods
and
we're
in
big
trouble

to
my
life
well
there's
the
door
please
feel
free
to
walk
out
at
any
time
and
live
your
life
and
that's
all
i
wanted
too
cordelia
i
spent
a
year's
allowance
on
this
dress
because
this
is
all
i
do
this
is
what
my
life
is
you
couldn't
understand
i
just
thought
homecoming
queen
i
could
pick
up
a
yearbook
someday
and
say
i
was
there
i
went
to
high
school
i
had
friends
and
for
one
moment
i
got
to
live
in
the
world
and
there'd
be
proof
proof
that
i
was
chosen
for
something
other
than
this
besides
i
look
cute
in
a
tiara
cor
the
gun
ooh
cordelia
the
spatula
we
gotta
get
back
to
the
library
jungle
bob
and
spikehead
are
down
and
out
we've
lost
the
germans
twice
but
they
seem
to
keep
finding
us
if
we
take
them
out
and
the
gorches
we
can
still
make
homecoming
we
just
need
to
find
giles
that
should
teach
him
to
mistake
you
for
a
slayer
aw
it's
okay
it
gave
cor
and
i
a
chance
to
spend
some
quality
death
time
jungle
bob
said
that
the
germans
were
hooked
into
a
computer
system
and
they're
hooked
into
us
i
need
some
wet
toilet
paper
long
story
apparently
not
that
long
tell
you
one
thing
though
you
don't
wanna
mess
with
cordelia
damn
important
