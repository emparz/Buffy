seems
like
a
lot
of
fuss
for
one
little
title
as
long
as
fun
is
still
in
the
mix
we
have
to
find
buffy
something
terrible's
happened
iii
think
i'll
retreat
to
the
library
until
the
coronation
yes
i
must
admit
i
do
feel
partly
responsible
i
did
give
your
friends
tacit
approval
to
make
the
switch
in
the
limousine
oh
that's
nice
although
i
don't
recall
them
mentioning
corsages
