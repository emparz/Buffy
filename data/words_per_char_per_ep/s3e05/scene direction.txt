willow
looks
back
at

xander
just
stares
at
him
lyrics
sees
xander's
sandwich
he
goes
off
to
find
the
buffet
table
to
get
a
few
sandwiches
of
his
own
xander
looks
back
at
the
band
now
too
buffy
scans
the
forest
around
them
as
they
go
cordelia
just
follows
her
they
slow
to
a
walk
buffy
ignores
cordelia's
comment
and
keeps
scanning
around
them
cordelia
looks
down
and
sees
that
buffy
is
about
to
step
into
a
bear
trap
with
her
fast
slayer
reflexes
buffy
instantly
lifts
her
foot
back
up
and
the
trap
snaps
shut
empty
knowing
someone
must
be
near
buffy
grabs
cordelia
and
pulls
her
to
the
ground
as
jungle
bob
takes
aim
with
his
rifle
he
shoots
and
misses
buffy
grabs
the
sprung
trap
and
hurls
it
at
jungle
bob
it
hits
him
hard
and
he
staggers
back
and
steps
into
another
bear
trap
he
grunts
when
it
snaps
shut
on
his
leg
buffy
hurries
over
to
him
with
cordelia
not
far
behind
she
picks
up
his
rifle
and
points
it
at
him
jungle
bob
tries
to
pry
open
the
trap
he
just
stares
at
her
refusing
to
speak
buffy
pumps
a
fresh
round
into
the
gun's
chamber
this
gives
him
cause
to
think
again
yellowskinned
demon
with
long
knives
vampire
couple
from
texas
named
gorch
cordelia
screams
and
jumps
back
as
kulak's
serrated
weapons
slice
into
the
tree
in
front
of
her
lyrics
with
lots
of
gesturing
lyrics
puts
her
hands
on
his
chest
scott's
date
isn't
sure
what
to
make
of
that
faith
turns
to
her
and
touches
her
on
the
shoulder
the
camera
pans
back
across
the
buffet
table
to
giles
he
chews
on
a
bite
of
his
finger
sandwich
and
steps
over
to
willow
and
xander
sitting
angled
away
from
each
other
willow
stares
at
the
floor
while
xander
leans
his
face
into
his
fist
xander
gives
him
a
quick
disgusted
glance
willow
just
stares
sadly
at
the
floor
he
gets
no
reaction
from
either
of
them
cordelia
panting
with
fright
buffy
pulls
back
the
drapes
from
another
window
to
close
its
shutters
but
it
comes
loose
in
her
hand
and
falls
to
the
floor
buffy
shrugs
she
pulls
the
drapes
across
to
at
least
block
the
view
and
goes
on
to
do
the
rest
of
the
windows
cordelia

buffy
allows
her
attention
to
be
diverted
by
cordelia
for
a
moment
she
sighs
and
goes
over
to
her
buffy
heads
back
to
a
window
cordelia
buffy
turns
back
to
face
her
she
looks
around
and
sees
an
end

with
drawers
walks
over
to
it
and
starts
searching
for
anything
that
she
can
use
buffy
resumes
her
surveillance
at
the
window
she
finds
a
spatula
and
takes
it
over
to
buffy
she
swings
it
a
few
times
and
realizes
it
probably
won't
be
of
much
use
cordelia
exhales
he
zeros
in
on
a
grid
on
his
computer
map
the
phone
clicks
and
goes
dead
kulak
gives
him
a
disgusted
grunt
and
walks
off
after

staring
out
a
window
buffy
looks
back
at
her
buffy
points
with
the
rifle
she
walks
over
to
another
window
and
looks
out
again
buffy
turns
to
face

lets
out
a
little
laugh

they
hear
a
growl
outside
of
the
cabin
suddenly
kulak
comes
crashing
through
a
window
he
immediately
grabs
buffy
and
throws
her
down
onto
an
old
mattress
and
pillow
on
the
floor
making
her
drop
the
rifle
she
rolls
out
of
the
way
as
he
swings
at
her
with
his
green
serrated
blades
and
they
just
slice
into
the
pillow
buffy
rushes
to
the
far
wall
and
takes
down
a
set
of
antlers
to
use
for
defense
kulak
swings
his
blades
at
her
while
cordelia
slaps
him
on
the
back
with

blocks
the
blades
with
the
antlers
and
shoves
the
antlers
aside
kulak
goes
down
with
them
kulak
gets
to
his
knees
and
takes
a
wide
swing
at
buffy

her
slightly
on
the
arm
and
making
her
fall
cordelia
finds
the
rifle
on
the
floor
and
picks
it
up

stands
up
and
tries
another
swing
but
buffy
grabs
the
end
of
the
rug
he's
standing
on
and
yanks
it
out
from
under
him
making
him
fall
backward
and
hit
the
floor
hard
on
his
back

has
the
gun
raised
now

it
around

for
a
target
kulak
gets
back
to
his
feet
and
cordelia
shoots
but
misses

a
bottle
on
a
shelf
instead
cut
inside
the
cabin
kulak
takes
a
lunging
swing
at
buffy
she
avoids
it
and
grabs
the
hanging
lamp
above
her
and
uses
it
to
support
herself
to
deliver
a
solid
midair
roundhouse
kick
to
kulak's
face
he
goes
flying
backward
into
a
desk
against
the
wall

to

tries
to
get

her
the
rifle
she
aims
it
at
kulak
as
he
gets
up
from
the
floor
he
roars
and
starts
to
come
at
her
buffy
pulls
the
trigger
but
the
chamber
is
still
empty
from
cordelia's
shot
so
the
hammer
just
clicks
on
nothing
buffy
quickly
raises
the
rifle
above
her
head
to
block
kulak's
swing
his
blade
embeds
itself
in
the
rifle's
stock
and
buffy
twists
it
around
pulling

arm
with
it
and
pinning
him
down

in

cordelia
both
jump
and
crash
through
the
glass
kulak
jumps
also
but
his

is
shuttered
behind
the
curtain
so
he
just
bounces
off
of
it
and
back
into
the
room
by
the
grenade
he
takes
a
quick
terrified
breath
cut

stagger
a
bit
she
grabs
buffy
by
the

of
the
neck
and
shoves
her
into

and
breaking
several
of

as

falls
to
