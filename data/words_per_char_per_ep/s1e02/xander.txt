me
that
girl
grabbed
him
and
took
off
i
don't

is
where
i
have
a
problem
see
because
we're
talking
about
vampires
we're
having
a
talk
with
vampires
in
it
so
vampires
are
demons
and
that
would
be
a
what
except
for
one
thing
how
do
you
kill
them
well
jesse's

can
fly

an
electrical
tunnel
that
runs
under
the
whole
town
i
don't
see
any
access
someone's
been
naughty
what
so
what's
the
plan
we
saddle
up
right
i
knew

throw
that
back
in
my
face
i'm
inadequate

less
than
a
man
paranormal

of
toads
rain
of
toads

you
think
they'd
have
anything
like

in
the
paper

in
the
meantime
will
help
by
standing
around
like
an
idiot

is
just
too
much
i
mean

my
life's
like
'uh

through
the
heart

of
those
things
