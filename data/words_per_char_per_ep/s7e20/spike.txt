of
the
apocalypse

i
heard
i
was
over
there
that
bitch
she's
all
about
smiles
and
reformation
when
you're
on
your
feet
but
the
moment
you're
down
she's
all
about
the
kicking
isn't
that
right
makes
me
want—
no
this'll
change
your
tune
i
came
here
'cause
i
got
something
to
tell
you
you
were
right
caleb
is
trying
to
protect
something
from
you
and
i
think
you
were
spot
on
all
the
way
i
think
it's
at
the
vineyard
so
you
were
right
buffy
you're
not
fooling
me
well
you're
not
a
quitter
you
were
their
leader
and
you
still
are
this
isn't
something
you
gave
up
it's
something
they
took
we
can
take
it
back
no
you
mean
no
as
in
eventually
you
can
get
them
back
they
need
you
it's
bloody
chaos
over
there
without
you
yeah
yeah
it's
uh
there's
junk
you
know
food
cartons
sleeping
bags
not
rolled
up
everyone's
very
scared
and
uh
unkempt
i
didn't
see
a
lot
i
came
hit
faith
a
bunch
of
times
and
left
oh
you
say
the
word
and
she's
a
footnote
in
history
i'll
make
it
look
like
a
painful
accident
there's
always
casualties
in
war
i
seem
to
recall
a
certain
amount
of
connecting
you
think
that's
all
that
was
oh
no
no
let's
hold
on
here
i'm
hummed
along
to
your
pityditty
and
i
think
i
should
have
the
mic
for
a
bit
you're
insufferable
i'm
not
trying
to
cheer
you
up
i
don't
know
i'll
know
when
i'm
done
saying
it
something
pissed
me
off
and
i
just—
unattainable
that's
it
you
listen
to
me
i've
been
alive
a
bit
longer
than
you
and
dead
a
lot
longer
than
that
i've
seen
things
you
couldn't
imagine
and
done
things
i
prefer
you
didn't
i
don't
exactly
have
a
reputation
for
being
a
thinker
i
follow
my
blood
which
doesn't
exactly
rush
in
the
direction
of
my
brain
so
i
make
a
lot
of
mistakes
a
lot
of
wrong
bloody
calls
a
100+
years
and
there's
only
one
thing
i've
ever
been
sure
of
you
hey
look
at
me
i'm
not
asking
you
for
anything
when
i
say
i
love
you
it's
not
because
i
want
you
or
because
i
can't
have
you
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
i
love
what
you
are
what
you
do
how
you
try
i've
seen
your
kindness
and
your
strength
i've
seen
the
best
and
the
worst
of
you
and
i
understand
with
perfect
clarity
exactly
what
you
are
you're
a
hell
of
a
woman
you're
the
one
buffy
i
don't
wanna
be
this
good
looking
and
athletic
we
all
have
crosses
to
bear
you
get
some
rest
now
i'll
check
in
before
first
light
you
can
decide
how
you
want
sure
that
diabolical
old
torture
device
the
comfy
chair
it'll
do
me
fine
