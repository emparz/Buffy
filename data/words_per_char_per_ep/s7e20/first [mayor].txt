hello

a
nice
to

little
more
welcome

the
end
of
humanity

the
end
of
courtesy

late
mayor
and
founder
of
sunnydale
here
i'll
prove
it
to
you

me
a
question
only
i
know
the
answer
to
something
like
where
did
i
hide
the
moon
pies
in
my
office
or
who
was
my
favorite
character
in
little
women
meg
i
know
i
know
most
people

beth
but
meg
she's
such
a
proper
young
lady
remember
when
jo
burned
her
hair
hey

hey
hey
hey
language
you're
a
leader
now
you
keep
throwing
the
hedouble
hockey
sticks
around
pretty
soon
the
girls
are
going
to
pick
up
on
it
then
what
of
course
of
course
you're
doing
a
great
job
with
them
by
the
way
much
better
than
buffy
ever
did
you
were
smart
to
kick
her
out
why
are
you
protecting
her
you
think
she
cares
about
you
she
nearly
killed
you
faith
no
matter
what
you
do
buffy
will
always
see
you
as
a
killer
not
as
a
person
and
now
you
have
what
she
so
desperately
wants
the
respect
of
these
girls
all
she
needs
is
an
excuse
and
she'll
finish
what
she
started
when
she
stuck
that
knife
in
your
belly
you
stay
on
guard
faith
buffy's
dangerous
if
you're
not
careful
she'll
destroy
you
i'm
just
saying
deep
down
you
always
wanted
buffy
to
accept
you
to
love
you
even
why
do
you
think
that
is
you
keep
looking
for
love
and
acceptance
from
these
people
these
friends
of
yours
but
you're
never
gonna
find
it
the
truth
is
nobody
will
ever
love
you
not
the
way
i
love
you
they'll
forever
see
you
as
a
killer
i'll
always
be
with
you
firecracker
in
everything
you
do
