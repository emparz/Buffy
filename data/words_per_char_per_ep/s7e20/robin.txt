maybe
you
don't
have
to
be
so
blunt
about
the
losing
of
the
necks
bit
maybe
we
should
break
down
into
small
groups
so
it
wouldn't
be
so
chaotic
faith
what
do
you
think
how
do
you
think
we
should
catch
one
if
they
don't
want
to
be
found
faith
sorry
i
knocked
just—you're
looking
spooked
what
happened
are
you
sure
you're
all
right
ok
you
know
what
i
came
up
here
to
talk
to
you
about
weapons
listen
i'm
gonna
leave
you
alone
i
didn't
mean
to
intrude
well
you're
really
in
the
game
now
faith
the
first
doesn't
show
itself
unless
it
thinks
you
matter
that's
exactly
what
the
first
does—finds
your
achilles'
heel
um
it's
a
phrase
your
weak
spot
so
who
was
it
the
first
just
a
boss
and
he's
got
you
shaking
like
this
wouldn't
give
you
a
raise
huh
oh
it
was
my
mother
when
it
came
to
me
and
i
mean
it
was
her
right
down
to
the
perfume
yeah
yeah
so
did
i
but
i
still
wanted
my
mother
to
hold
me
like
a
little
baby—
in
a
manly
way
of
course
listen
nobody
wants
to
be
alone
faith
we
all
want
someone
who
cares
to
be
touched
that
way
i
mean
the
first
deals
in
figments
but
that
wanting
is
real
among
other
things
yeah
well
what
do
you
think
she's
not
the
only
one
you're
a
slayer
too
faith
and
i
think
you're
a
good
leader
yeah
well
i'm
the
principal
of
a
school
where
nobody
finished
and
i
am
completely
out
of
my
league
in
this
so
um
tomorrow
then
no
you're
the
leader
where
do
you
want
me
faith
