we're
wasting
time
arguing
about
how
to
argue

pushing
too
hard
oh

think
i've
read
a
translation
of
it

think
so
i
just
need
to
get
together
a
few
ingredients
uhwhile
you
were
gone
we
all
got
together
and
ttalked
out
some
disagreements
that
we
were
having
um
and
eventually
after
much
discussion
buffy
decided
that
it
would
be
best
for
all
of
us
if
she
took
a
little
time
off
a
little
breather
we're
her
friends
we
just
want—
speak
to
us
i
don't
know

that
should
have
worked
ok

do
you—the
we—do
for
the
first
ok
guys
giles
said
faith
wants
us
to
start
early
in
the
morning
so—
what
happened
to
the
girls

about
the
other

then
good
yeah
ggood
feeling
but
also
well
sort
of
the
unrestrained
part
but
i've
just—i've
kind
of
been
in
this
space
where
i
should
be
restrained
i've
been
controlling
myself
and
i—
if
i
lose
that
control
let
myself
go
i
could
just
go

not
stupid
