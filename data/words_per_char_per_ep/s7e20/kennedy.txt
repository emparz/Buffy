what
we're
saying
is
we're
in
charge
in
charge
of
ourselves
all
i'm
saying
is
now
that
buffy's
not
here
we
finally
have
some
say
in
how
and
when
we
lose
our
necks
i
just
wonder
if
those
of
us
who
have
been
here
longer
should
have
more
of
a
say
shouldn't
we
get
down
to
business
do
we
really
have
time
to
waste
i'll
check
the
fuse
box
which
means
we
also
know
that
caleb
told
buffy
that
everything's
going
down
at
the
seal
i
think
we
should
head—
faith
i'm
sorry—
and
what
hold
it
ransom
ok
i'm
not
sure
this
is
such
a
good
idea
why
try
and
get
information
when
we
already
know
about
the
seal
why
don't
we
send
a
team
to
the
high
school
do
some
recon
and—
just
like
that
you're
not
even
listening
i
thought
things
would
be
different
now
but
you
keep
shutting
me
down
i've
never
been
the
bait
before
that
was
uh
actually
kind
of
scary
i'm
method
let's
get
this
back
to
the
captain
quiet
somebody
needs
a
reality
check
how
tell
me
exactly
what
the
bringers
are
doing
looks
like
there's
only
one
girl
here
nope
nice
and
necessary
come
here
you
foreplay
was
threatening
to
turn
into
twelveplay
something
not
right
it's
probably
stupid
to
ask
why
huh
death
war
apocalypse
and
then
isn't
that
the
good
part
bad
stuff
like
unrestrained
moaning
and
screaming
with
joy
hm
you
worried
you're
gonna
turn
into
big
bad
willow
it's
not
stupid
but
it's
not
gonna
happen
i
just
want
you
to
know
you're
safe
with
me
you
can
float
around
and
i'll
tether
you
down
mmhmm

be
a
kite
and
i'll
be
your
kite
string
ok
