at

spanking
new
hellmouth
high
please
outside
of
drugs
and
violence
and
the
unwanted
pregnancy
and
uh
unleashing
of
hordes
of
armageddon
that
comes
pouring
out
of
the
school's
foundation
every
now
and
then
what
trouble
could
these
kids
have
those
kids

damn
lucky
having
a
slayer

a
friend
on
campus

appreciate
it

did
days
gone
by

being
a
vengeance
demon
and
i
bounced
back
to
being
a
dateless
nerd
i've
seen
her
at
the
bronze
a
couple
of
times

guess
there's
a
lot
of
scorned
women
there
making
vengeance
wishes
on
their
exes
