rocky
come
on
do
your
business
so
i
can
go
home
could've
gotten
a
cat
but
no
ahh
and
whatever
it
was
it
was
big
and
strong
stronger
than
i
mean
i
don't
know
how
it's
possible
you
hear
thing
in
this
town
living
here
in
sunnydale
but
nobody
actually
believes
them
you
know
you'd
have
to
be
crazy
and
you
guys
think
that
i'm
crazy
don't
you
no
that's
ok
thanks
just
this
kind
of
rumbling
you
know
like
just
before
an
earthquake
what
who
is
that
and
i'm
thinking
it's
a
little
more
complicated
than
just
that
shouldn't
we
call
the
police
or
something
i'll
stop
interrupting
is
your
girlfriend
always
this
commanding
boy
i
still
can't
believe
this
is
happening
i
mean
even
with
this
town's
reputation
for
you
know
unexplained
weirdness
there's
good
food
well
thanks
and
that's
a
couple
of
levels
of
lameness
right
there
me
saying
thanks
after
everything
you've
done
for
me
tonight
got
it
so
um
you
think
i
might
instead
give
you
a
call
sometime
no
actually
i'm
hitting
on
you
and
i'm
really
pushy
so
that
works
out
well
then
good
night
i
just
i
don't
think
so
i
just—i
don't
think
i
can
take
any
more
of
this
oh
sure
why
not
a
monster
trying
to
kill
me
it's
just
the
thing
that
was
missing
to
make
my
life
absolutely
perfect
uhh
ronnie
would
love
this
boy
oh
um
only
my
psycho
exboyfriend
that
i've
been
trying
to
get
rid
of
for
the
past
few
weeks
i
almost
prefer
the
monster
ronnie
was
um
trouble
ronnie
he
couldn't
he
just
he
was
an
abusive
bastard
is
the
catchy
headline
and
he'd
just
show
up
even
after
you
know
the
feeling
that
you
get
when
your
ex
is
constantly
ruining
every
part
of
your
life
and
it
just
doesn't
stop
and
you
get
so
tired
of
feeling
helpless
that
all
you
can
do
is
just
wish
that
it
would
stop
no
way
are
you
saying
that
thing
was
ronnie
well
we
were
just
talking
i
think
i'm
gonna
be
sick
xander
who
is
this
woman
oh
i
thought
you
were
xander's
exgirlfriend
but
you
and
spike
but
weren't
you
buffy—
is
there
anyone
here
that
hasn't
slept
together
wait
i
didn't
wish
for
that
i
mean
i
don't
even
know
what
this
whatchamacallit
demon
thing
is
freaks
why
do
i
always
surround
myself
with
freaks
