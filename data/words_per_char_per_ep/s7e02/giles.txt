the
taxi's
here
and
in
keeping
with
a
quaint
old
birtish
tradition
you
would
now
be
expected
to
get
into
it
that's
your
fear
talking
true
it's
possible
but
try
to
be
very
specific
what
exactly
are
you
afraid
of
they
won't
take
you
back
willow
we
could
spend
another
two
years
here
training
and
practicing
and
learning
to
hone
your
powers
and
still
there'd
be
no
way
of
knowing
for
sure
that
the
friends
you
left
behind
you
are
still
your
friends
i'd
love
to
offer
you
some
guarantee
that
you'd
be
welcomed
back
to
sunnydale
with
open
arms
but
i
can't
you
may
not
be
wanted
but
you
will
be
needed
for
the
moment
yes
trust
yourself
and
the
others
might
follow
