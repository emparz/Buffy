i
know
i
don't
know
if
i
can
giles
i'm
not
done
here
yes
and
my
fear's
a
big
obnoxious
blabbermouth
you're
the
one
that
keeps
telling
me
to
trust
my
instincts
so
shouldn't
we
be
listening
i
don't
want
to
go
back
home
just
so
i
can
screw
up
again
i
why
don't
i
stay
not
forever
just
long
enough
to
i
don't
know
make
my
fear
shut
up
a
little
maybe
well
for
starters
how
'bout
the
hellmouth's
getting
all
rumbly
again
and
now
i
know
it's
got
teeth
and
are
those
literal
teeth
'cause
i
don't
know
if
i
can
handle
it
and
what
if
i
can
handle
it
does
that
mean
i
have
to
be
a
bigger
badder
badass
than
the
source
of
all
badness
and
what
if
i
give
up
all
this
control
stuff
and
i
go
all
veiny
and
homicidal
again
and
what
ifâ€”
uhhuh
well
sure
i
mean
if
you
put
it
that
way
duh
that
all
you
got
ok
i
guess
i'd
better
