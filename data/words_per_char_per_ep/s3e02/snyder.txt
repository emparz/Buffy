absolutely
not
under
no
circumstances
i
have
not
only
the
right
but
also
a
nearly
physical
sensation
of
pleasure
at
the
thought
of
keeping
her
out
of
school
i'd
describe
myself
as
tingly
yes
and
while
she
may
live
up
to
the
notamurderer
requirement
for
enrollment
she
is
a
troublemaker
destructive
to
school
property
and
the
occasional
student
and
her
grade
point
average
is
enough
to



i'm
sorry
another
tingle
moment
i'm
quite
sure
that
a
girl
with
the
talents
and
abilities
of
buffy
will
land
on
her
feet
in
fact
i
noticed
as
i
came
in
this
morning
that
hot
dog
on
a
stick
is
hiring
you
will
look
so
cute
in
that
hat
wouldn't
that
be
interesting
do
we
have
an
appointment
if
that
word
is
buffy
then
i
have
two
words
for
you
'good'
and
'riddance'
now
if
you
don't
mind
i
have
an
appointment
with
the
mayor
i
think
you'll
find
i
can
i
have
grounds
i
have
precedent
and
a
tingly
kind
of
feeling
why
don't
you
take
it
up
with
the
city
council
sorry
i'm
not
convinced
