you
shouldn't
sneak
up
on
people
like
that
jeez
buff
mad
just
because
you
ran
away
and
abandoned
your
post
and
your
friends
and
your
mom
and
made
him
lay
awake
every
night
worrying
about
you
maybe
we
should
wait
out
here
check
it
out
the
watcher
is
back
on
the
clock
and
just
when
you
were
thinking
career
change
maybe
becoming
a



a
looker
or
a



a
seer
so
where
were
you
did
you
go
to
belgium
i
think
the
relevant
question
is
why
wouldn't
you
belgium
oh
you
know
same
old
same
old
okay
i
lied
a
whole
lot
is
new
oh
yeah
absolutely
except
for
the
obvious
it's
not
too
much



cordelia's
parents
dragged
her
onto
a
luxury
vacation
so
skip
the
heartwarming
stuff
about
kindly
old
people
and
saving
the
farm
and
get
right
to
the
dirt
fair
enough
in
fact
you
can
leave
the
slaying
to
us
while
you
settle
in
we
got
you
covered
whatever
we
were
kicking
a
little
undead
booty
oh
i
would
but
uh
uh
you
gotta
admire
the
purity
of
it
well
i
hate
brie
you
know
what
i
mean
she
doesn't
want
to
talk
about
it
we
don't
want
to
talk
about
it
so
why
don't
we
just
shut
up
and
dance
okay
so
one
vote
from
the
old
guy
for
a
smelly
cheese
night
and
how
many
votes
for
actual
fun
huh
hey
buff
uh



what
are
you
doing
was
i
now
well
you
did
you
should've
seen
what
you
put
her
through
you
know
maybe
you
don't
want
to
hear
it
buffy
but
taking
off
like
you
did
was
incredibly
selfish
and
stupid
did
you
even
try
talking
to
anybody
yeah
and
you
see
how
well
that
one
worked
out
you
can't
just
bury
stuff
buffy
it'll
come
right
back
up
to
get
you
look
i'm
sorry
that
your
honey
was
a
demon
but
most
girls
don't
hop
a
greyhound
over
boy
troubles
let
her
finish
you
at
least
owe
her
that
fine
you
stop
acting
like
an
idiot
i'll
stop
annoying
you
i
got
your
back
man
this
sucker
wobbles
but
he
won't
fall
down
i
got
him
go
help
buffy
hurry
hurry
hurry
hurry
i
kind
of
think
we
die
generally
speaking
when
scary
things
get
scared
not
good
nice
moves
