she's
in
ecstasy

her
hollowed
sky

pours
down
heavenly

fakes
desire
i've
been
living
here

in
the
red

i've
been
feeling
i'm

dead
again
we've
been
bored
before
i
have
never
felt

so
alone
since
the
time
we
left
ourselves

half
past
gone
we've
been
living
here

up
against
the
red
i've
been
feeling
i'm

dead
again

we've
been
bored
before
we'll
be
bored
again

we've
been
bored
before
and
again
she's
in
ecstasy

her
hollowed
sky
time's
healing
i'm
ahead

find
a
reason
once
again

take
a
moment
outta
time

i'll
be
standing
back
behind
on
a
wing

so
outta
line
mm
taken
in

so
outta
time
sound
the
season
in
my
head
so
outta
time

all
it
takes
is
living

i
want
to
fly
i've
never
known
fate
i've
never
known
your
name
i've
never
known
fate
someone
take
me
home

get
me
outta
here
