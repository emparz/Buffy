shall
now
proceed
into
the
incan
burial
chamber
the
human
sacrifice
is
about
to
begin
five
hundred
years
ago
the
incan
people
chose
a
beautiful
teenage
girl
to
become
their
princess
the
princess
remained
there
protected
only
by
a
cursed
seal
placed
there
as
a
warning
to
any
who
would
wake
her
now
if
you'll
follow
me
this
way
