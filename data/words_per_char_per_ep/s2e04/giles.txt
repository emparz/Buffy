i
think
not
because
you
are
the
chosen
one
well
i'm
afraid
that
is
not
you
have
responsibilities
that
other
girls
do
not
it's
as
if
you
know
me
your
secret
identity
is
gonna
be
difficult
enough
to
maintain
while
this
exchange
student
is
living
with
you
fine
go
i'll
just
go
and
introduce
my
shoulder
to
a
an
icepack
trouble
with
mr
munson
again
we'll
deal
with
that
when
we've
ruled
out
evil
curses
there
was
a
seal
look
at
this
series
of
pictograms
well
we'll
fret
about
the
details
later
let's
just
get
out
of
here
before
he
comes
back
yes
yes
very
my
resources
on
this
subject
are
extremely
limited
ii
gather
that
this
particular
mummy
was
from
the
sebancaya
region
of
eastern
peru
it's
very
remote
now
if
there's
an
answer
then
it's
it's
locked
in
the
it's
gonna
take
me
weeks
to
translate
these
pictograms
well
we'll
start
tonight
with
i
was
gonna
suggest
hunting
how
do
you
do
i
was
i
was
wondering
if
you
could
um
translate
this
well
uh
uh
it's
well
it's
an
artifact
from
from
uh
your
region
iit's
uh
from
the
tomb
of
aan
incan
mummy
aaactually
we
were
trying
to
translate
it
uh
um
as
aa
project
for
our
um
very
good
is
is
uh
anything
you
recognize
here
um
um
this
this
um
this
chchap
here
with
the
knife
for
instance
bodyguard
interesting
well
uh
yes
well
that's
um
that's
a
very
good
starting
point
for
our
um
club
um
right
i'll
uh
continue
with
the
translation
buffy
you
research
this
uh
bodyguard
thing
and
uh
willow
willow
good
lord
good
work
yes
this
is
most
illuminating
it
seems
rodney's
killer
might
be
the
mummy
well
here
it
implies
that
the
mummy
is
capable
of
feeding
on
the
life
force
of
a
person
effectively
freezedrying
them
you
might
say
extraordinary
well
the
answer
to
that
is
somewhere
still
in
here
or
in
the
rest
of
the
seal
here
you
are
i'm
afraid
someone
already
has
well
um
perhaps
he
needs
to
put
it
together
with
the
other
pieces
and
if
he
didn't
then
then
they'd
still
be
at
the
museum
and
hopefully
we'll
be
ready
alright
we'll
meet
there
tonight
after
it
closes
thank
heavens
you're
home
no
he's
already
been
found
in
a
school
restroom
mummified
well
i've
crossreferenced
and
uh
i've
looked
at
the
pictograms
anew
he
was
a
guard
alright
but
it
was
his
job
to
insure
that
the
mummy
didn't
awaken
and
escape
perhaps
yes
i
suppose
she
was
i
beg
your
pardon
it's
certainly
all
boys'
clothes
why
would
a
girl
pack
these
it
is
down
and
then
she
wanted
us
to
destroy
it
becau
oh
wait
well
we
already
know
that
the
seal
was
used
to
contain
the
mummy
if
breaking
it
freed
her
i'll
go
to
the
museum
i'll
drop
you
off
i'll
try
to
piece
together
the
fragments
there
'incan
cosmology
unites
the
bird
head
with
its
paler
twin'
um
oh
here
its
paler
twin
there
that's
it
just
one
more
piece
