spike
of

with
that
new
diet
of
yours
you
wanna
be
careful
what
you
try
puttin'
in
your
mouth
now
spikey
okeydokey
'scuse
us
hey
mister
passiveaggressive
guy
seriously
you
wanna
take
it
down
a
notch
or
two
in
there
we
do
not
joke
about
eating
people
in
this
house
i
should
have
thrown
you
out
the
second
you
got
here
i
was
insane
to
ever
think
you
could
just
hang
out
with
my
friends
i
think
it's
time
for
you
to
go
okay
i'll
go
fine
i'm
actually
trying
to
move
right
now
well

this
can't
be
good
there's
something
keeping
us
in
this
house
hence
the
problem
i
know
i
know
we
all
have
places
that
we'd
rather
be
i
think
the
first
priority
has
to
be
to
find
a
way
out
dawn
did
you
do
something
dawnie
it's
okay
you
know
we're
not
gonna
be
mad
dawn
we're
just
trying
to
figure
out
what's
going
on
dawn
if
you
want
us
to
spend
time
with
you
she's
just
so
angry
i
know
i
just
can't
figure
out
why
she
didn't
come
to
me
i
think
magic's
gonna
be
our
best
bet
something
general
you
know
cast
a
wide
net
well
we
don't
have
any
in
the
house
we
got
rid
of
everything
that's
the
demon
i
killed
two
nights
ago
hey
iit's
gonna
be
okay
just
trust
me
i
promise
we'll
be
out
of
here
soon
okay
so
maybe
'soon'
was
a
bit
of
an
overstatement
i'm
gonna
go
check
upstairs
keep
an
eye
on
things
down
here
you
stay
here
okay
grab
the
sword
are
you
hurt
here
let
me
see
it's
getting
kinda
scary
you
okay
fine
stay
with
spike
i
never
said
that
you
did
what
did
you
want
dawn
come
on
what
are
you
talking
about
i
don't
know
what
what
you're
not
alone
i
wish
you
would
have
told
me
what
i
haven't
been
what
dawn

the
most
important
job
that
i
have

is
looking
out
for
you
counselor
and
you'd

never
met
her
before
and

she
got
you
to
start
talking
about
things
that
bothered
you
at
home
you
didn't
by
any
chance
happen
to

express
like
a
a
wish
oror
something
to
her
anya
it
wasn't
her
fault
anya
hold
on
okay
tell
her
you
didn't
do
this
tell
her
it's
a
mistake
oh
look
ii
don't
think
she
i
don't
think
it's
all
her
fault
okay
she

there
was
a
guidance
counselor
or
someone
pretending
to
be
a
guidance
counselor
she
she
made
dawn
make
a
wish
you
guys
know
each
other

it's
worn
off
