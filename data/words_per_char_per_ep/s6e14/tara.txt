plan
for
a
sleepover
i
know
iit's
like
i
wanna
leave
but
i
don't
want
to
has
everyone
tried
to
get
out
do
you
know
something
'cause
we
want
you
to
feel
like
you
can
tell
us
phones
are
all
out
we're
totally
cut
off
it
happens
we
all
went
through
it
even
if
dawn
does
know
something
she's
obviously
not
gonna
help
us
right
now
we
need
another
way
no
i'll
do
it
it's
just
oobviously
i
didn't
bring
any
supplies
just

bring
me
what
you
have
but
i'm
doing
this
alone
you
need
to
stay
away
from
it
release
try
the
door
let's
get
him
upstairs
we
need
to
get
him
to
a
doctor
soon
i
just
think
we
haven't
thought
of
the
right
way
out
yet
that's
all
i'd
say
we
do
another
spell
but
i
i
think
we've
tried
everything
she
said
no
and
that's
it
you're
not
gonna
make
her
do
something
that
she
doesn't
want
to
and
if
you
try
you're
gonna
have
to
go
through
me
first
understood
i
thought
vengeance
demons
only
punished
men
who
wronged
women
no
problem
i
get
it
ii
really
do
but
it's
time
to
work
without
the
net
will
you
know
i
don't
know
if
you
noticed
but
it
actually
did
get
bad
in
there
really
bad
and

and
you
still
said
no
wow
look
at
the
stars
