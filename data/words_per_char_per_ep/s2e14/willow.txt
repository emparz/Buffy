no
xander's
right
my
god
you
people
are
all
well
i'm
upset
and
i
can't
think
of
a
mean
word
right
now
but
that's
what
you
are
and
we're
going
to
the
factory
buffy
well
some
of
us
were
i'm
sure
he'll
come
by
buffy
wait
up
you
don't
think
angel
would
have
gone
after
the
judge
himself
do
you
ok
no
no
he
didn't
but
i'm
sure
he'll
well
buffy
he
probably
has
some
plan
and
he's
trying
to
protect
you
well
ii
don't
know
what
i'm
not
in
on
the
plan
it's
his
plan

even
say
that
angel
is
not
dead
yeah
of
course
we'll
be
here
okay
bye
say
'hi'
for
me
she's
checked
every
place
she
can
think
of
she
even
beat
up
willy
the
snitch
a
couple
of
times
angel's
vanished
oh
yeah
but
she's
extra
wigged
this
time
i
guess
'cause
of
her
dreams
god
what
if
something
really
happened
to
him
yeah
she's
just
stopping
at
home
first
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
well
not
'knew
it'
in
the
sense
of
having
the
slightest
idea
but
i
knew
there
was
something
i
didn't
know
you
two
were
fighting
way
too
much
it's
not
natural
weird
it's
against
all
laws
of
god
and
man
it's
cordelia
remember
the
the
'we
hate
cordelia'
club
of
which
you
are
the
treasurer
gee
what
stopped
you
could
it
be
shame
but
i'm
no
it
just
means
that
you'd
rather
be
with
someone
you
hate
than
be
with
me

this
straight

don't
understand
it
i
don't
wanna
understand
it
you
have
gross
emotional
problems
and
things

more
important
than
that
