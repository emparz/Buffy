xander
where's
angel
yeah
i
better
go
too
i'll
uh
go
on
the
'net
and
search
for
anything
on
the
judge
uncle
i
have
served
you
i
have
been
faithful
i
need
to
know
you
told
me
to
watch
angel
you
told
me
to
keep
him
from
the
slayer
i
tried
but
there
are
other
factors
there
are
terrible
things
happening
here
that
we
cannot
control
angel
could
be
of
help
to
us
i
mean
he
may
be
the
only
chance
we
have
to
stop
the
judge
why
then
if
somehow
if
if
it's
happened
then
angelus
is
back
buffy
loves
him
unless
he
kills
her
first
uncle
this
is
insanity
people
are
going
to
die
you
are
a
fool
we're
all
fools
willow
get
away
from
him
walk
to
me
he's
not
angel
anymore
are
you
rupert
don't
talk
like
that
the
kids
none
of
us
were
but
you
didn't
know
he
had
turned
bad
what
well
i
saw
his
face
assuming
they
don't
attack
tonight
i
think
we
should
just
let
her
be
i
didn't
know
exactly
i
was
told
oh
god
i
was
sent
here
to
watch
you
they
told
me
to
keep
you
and
angel
apart
they
never
told
me
what
would
happen
i'm
sorry
rupert
angel
was
supposed
to
pay
for
what
he
did
to
my
people
i
didn't
know
what
would
happen
until
after
i
swear
i
would've
told
you
i
think
so
i
mean
if
you
the
curse
if
angel
achieved
true
happiness
even
just
a
moment
of
he
would
lose
his
soul
if
there
is
anything
that
no
ii
can't
i
mean
those
magicks
are
long
lost
even
to
my
people
it
can't
be
done
i
can't
help
you
oh
my
god
do
you
uh
is
there
something
i
can
do
ii
just
want
to
help
