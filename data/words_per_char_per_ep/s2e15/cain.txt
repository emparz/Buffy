fresh
hey
what
a
man
and
a
girl
do
in
lovers'
lane
at
night

nobody's
busi

it's
funny
thinking
about
you

catching
one
i
mean
this
guy
looks
like
he's
auditioning
to
be
a
librarian
and
you
well
you're
a
girl
uhhuh
lemme
ask
you
something
sweetheart
exactly
how
many
of
these
animals
have
you
taken
out
i
tore
a
tooth
from
the
mouth
of
every
werewolf
that
i
killed
this
next
one
will
bring
the
total
to
an
even
dozen
well
see
that's
the
thing
their
pelts
fetch
a
pretty
penny
in
sri
lanka
and
it's
a
little
hard
to
skin
'em
when
they're
alive
no
no
i'm
in
it
purely
for
the
money
that's
why
i
only
hunt
'em
the
other
three
i'd
really
love
to
stay
and
chat
but
i'm
on
a
tight
schedule
any
idea
where
else
the
boys
and
girls
like
to
get
together
around
here
no
but
the
werewolf
is
they're
suckers
for
that
whole
sexual
heat
thing
sense
it
miles
away
since
this
little
doggie
ain't
here
i
guess
he
found
another
place
but
you
don't
know
squat
gee
what
a
surprise
you
let
it
get
away
chain
what
were
you
gonna
do
take
it
for
a
walk
that's
beautiful
this
is
what
happens
when
a
woman
tries
to
do
a
man's
job
uhhuh
and
daddy's
doing
a
great
job
carrying
her
bag
of
milk
bones
you
know
sis
if
that
thing
out
there
harms
anyone
it's
going
to
be
on
your
pretty
little
head
i
hope
you
can
live
with
that
first
they
tell
me
i
can't
hunt
an
elephant
for
its
ivory
now
i've
gotta
deal
with
people
for
the
ethical
treatment
of
werewolves
there
you
are
that's
it
let
me
see
you
come
on
suppertime
good
doggy

wonder
this
town's
overrun
with
monsters

man
enough
to
kill
'em
