well
it
seems
there
were
a
a
number
of
other
attacks
by
a
wild
dog
around
town
several
animal
carcasses
were
found
mutilated
yes
uh
um
fortunately
no
people
were
injured
well
for
now
but
my
guess
is
that
this
werewolf
will
be
back
at
next
month's
full
moon
pardon
yes
i
must
admit
i
i
am
intrigued
werewolves
it's
it's
one
of
the
classics
i
i'm
sure
my
books
and
i
are
in
for
a
fascinating
afternoon
and
uh
while
there's
absolutely
no
scientific
explanation
for
lunar
effect
on
the
human
psyche
uh
the
phases
of
the
moon
uh
do
seem
to
exert
a
great
deal
of
psychological
influence
and
ththe
full
moon
is
is
seems
to
bring
out
our
darkest
qualities
oh
yes
the
moon
pie
yyou
see
uh
thethe
werewolf
uh
is
such
a
a
potent
eeextreme
representation
of
our
inborn
animalistic
traits
that
it
eemerges
for
three
full
consecutive
nights
the
full
moon
and
uh
the
two
nights
surrounding
it
quite
and
it
uh
acts
onon
pure
instinct
no
conscience
uh
uh
predatory
and
and
aggressive
yes
let's
not
jump
to
any
conclusions
the
point
is
that
our
wolfman
could
also
be
aaa
wolfwoman
or
or
anyone
who
was
bitten
by
a
werewolf
no
no
bullets
no
matter
who
this
werewolf
is
iit's
still
a
human
being
who
may
be
completely
unaware
of
his
or
her
condition
anything
yet
uh
the
same
i
thought
we
might
uh
i
thought
we
might
knock
on
a
few
windows
uh
ask
if
anyone
has
seen
anything
yet
oh
yes
no
ofofof
course
not
no
yes
hey
whoa
who
who
are
you
what
are
you
doing
you
alright
excuse
me
you'd
be
wise
to
take
that
back
i
assure
you
she's
quite
capable
yyou
hunt
werewolves
ffor
sport
where
are
we
going
looks
as
though
your
hunch
was
right
now
you
look
here
mr
cain
this
girl
risked
her
life
trying
to
capture
a
beast
that
you
haven't
as
yet
been
able
to
find
pillock
right
let's
move
out
uhh
oh
no
i'm
uh
i'm
okay
i'm
just
um
fine
uh
just
uh
i'm
uh
uh
any
sign
of
the
uh
werewolf
it's
uh
it's
it's
uh
gonna
be
light
soon
so
we'd
better
buffy
we're
gonna
get
this
thing
we
have
another
whole
night
there's
nothing
more
we
can
do
now
it's
nearly
sunrise
that
werewolf
won't
be
a
werewolf
much
longer
well
we
we
have
one
more
night
still
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
good
go
uh
in
the
meantime
we
need
to
cover
our
bases
iif
none
of
that
works
i
think
i
may
have
an
alternative
she's
a
vampire
buffy
i'm
so
sorry
all
set
let's
go
find
this
thing
are
you
certain
let's
go
i
put
enough
phenobarbital
in
this
thing
to
sink
a
small
elephant
it
should
be
enough
for
a
large
werewolf
damn
it
you
saved
us
he'll
be
a
little
sore
in
the
morning
but
he'll
be
oz
