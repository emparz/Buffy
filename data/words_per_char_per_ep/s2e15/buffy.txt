well
i
think
it's
nice
that
he's
not
just
being
an
animal
have
you
dropped
any
hints
ah
he'll
come
around
what
guy
could
resist
your
wily
willow
charms
well
none
of
them
know
a
thing
they
all
get
an
'f'
in
willow
he
will
i
wish
you
wouldn't
i'm
holding
i
was
going
on
two
minutes
there
without
thinking
about
angel
but
i
would
do
a
lot
better
if
you
and
xander
and
i
could
do
that
'sharing
our
misery'
thing
tonight
meow
welldeserved
and
you're
sure
it
was
a
werewolf
so
what's
the
word
that
falls
into
the
'that's
a
switch'
column
looks
like
giles
has
some
schooling
to
do
he
needs
to
get
a
pet
here's
a
suggestion
move
away
from
the
hellmouth
and
i'm
one
of
the
few
spoil
my
fun
uhh
uhh
in
other
words
your
typical
male
i
didn't
jump
i
took
a
tiny
step
and
there
conclusions
were
so
tonight
we
bring
'em
back
alive
yes
and
you
won't
believe
what
i
saw
brittany
podell
was
making
out
with
owen
stadeel
but
he
goes
with
barrett
williams
if
she
ever
found
no
um
no
no
sign
of
the
werewolf
how
about
you
giles
no
one's
seen
anything
giles
giles
ahem
hey
before
we
get
all
chummy
here
how
about
we
do
something
about
me
being
in
this
net
thing
yeah
oh
okay
hey
enough
repulsive
brain
it's
not
what
you
think
we're
hunting
werewolves
okay
it's
funny
if
you
don't
believe
in
werewolves
as
of
today
so
you're
just
gonna
kill
it
and
it
doesn't
bother
you
that
a
werewolf
is
a
person
twenty
eight
days
out
of
the
month
you're
looking
for
a
party
sorry
wish
i
could
help
you
i
think
i
know
where
to
look
we
just
have
to
make
it
there
before
mein
furrier
who
could
resist
sunnydale's
own
house
of
hormones
coming
through
i
didn't
let
it
do
anything
i
had
the
chain
around
its
neck
i
was
going
to
lock
it
up
i
live
with
that
every
day
giles
giles
i
didn't
see
you
there
i
thought
something
had
happened
no
i'm
guessing
you
didn't
see
anything
either
from
that
vantage
point
of
having
your
eyes
closed
wait
i
can't
believe
i
let
that
thing
get
away
cain
was
right
i
shoulda
killed
it
when
i
had
the
chance
uh
the
uh
the
werewolf
ititit
was
out
last
night
yeah
but
he
got
someone
theresa
and
i
coulda
stopped
it
oh
yeah
believe
me
i'm
gonna
give
that
wolfie
something
to
howl
about
you
said
you
didn't
remember
anything
about
that
and
he
was
awfully
gleeful
about
tormenting
theresa
where
are
we
going
yeah
me
and
the
werewolf
alone
in
a
cage
for
three
minutes
that's
all
i
ask
so
what's
the
scuttlebutt
anybody
besides
larry
fit
our
werewolf
profile
okay
most
of
those
were
not
my
fault
somebody
else
started
'em
i
was
just
standing
up
for
myself
one
two
three
i
um
noticed
you
were
looking
solo
i'm
sorry
welcome
to
the
mystery
that
is
men
i
think
it
goes
something
like
they
grow
body
hair
they
lose
all
ability
to
tell
you
what
they
really
want
well
if
you
wanna
up
the
speed
quotient
with
oz
maybe
you
need
to
do
something
daring
maybe
you
need
to
make
the
first
move
i
think
your
reputation
will
remain
intact
those
were
the
days
so
how'd
it
go
with
larry
i
think
it's
supposed
to
mean
'so
how'd
it
go
with
larry'
i'm
sorry
i
was
just
wondering
okay
but
there
goes
our
lead
suspect
tell
that
to
theresa
she
could
have
used
my
defending
before
she
was
ripped
apart
by
that
nowhere
in
any
of
the
reports
did
it
say
anything
about
her
being
mauled
i
mean
they
were
linked
to
the
animal
attacks
from
the
other
night
so
we
just
assumed
werewolf
vampire
no
good
instead
of
not
protecting
theresa
from
the
werewolf
i
was
able
to
not
protect
her
from
something
just
as
bad
she
had
a
lot
of
friends
angel
this
isn't
happening
he's
gonna
keep
coming
after
me
sorry
i'm
late
i
had
to
do
some
unscheduled
slayage
in
the
form
of
theresa
was
angel
sent
her
to
me
a
little
token
of
his
affection
not
now
giles
we
can
all
have
ourselves
a
good
cry
after
we
bag
us
a
werewolf
one
question
how
exactly
do
we
find
this
thing
whwhat's
oz
where
is
he
now
don't
worry
willow
we're
not
going
to
hurt
him
oh
i
wouldn't
be
too
sure
of
that
how
about
you
let
the
door
hit
you
in
the
ass
on
the
way
out
of
town
well
it's
gotta
be
weird
for
him
too
now
that
we
know
so
much
he's
still
a
human
being
most
of
the
time
oz
who
are
you
talking
about
what'd
you
do
that
was
weird
all
i
meant
is
that
he
didn't
try
to
look
up
my
skirt
weirdness
abounds
lately
maybe
it's
the
moon
that
does
stuff
to
people
certainly
gonna
put
a
strain
on
willow
and
oz's
relationship
i
don't
know
i
kinda
see
oz
as
the
loyal
type
xander
it's
not
up
to
you
