haven't
found
a
reference
to
any
uh
rituals
seems
more
like
aa
family
meal
if
you
will
ii'm
sorry
buffy
but
i
just
don't
understand
what
you're
trying
to
say
of
course
but
it
may
be
a
little
out
of
your
depth
how
did
he
ignore
evidence
no
yes
it
was
a
gift
xander
don't
speak
latin
in
front
of
the
books
yes
in
order
to
balance
the
new
force
of
good
the
spell
has
to
create
the
opposing
force
of
evil
the
worst
of
everything
everyone's
nightmare
yes
it
seems
that
the
wellbeing
of
this
creature
is
linked
to
jonathan
if
it
dies
the
spell
is
broken
and
jonathan
reverts
to
whatever
he
was
before
well
actually
it'll
remain
pretty
much
the
same
except
jonathan
won't
be
jonathan

not
our
jonathan
anyway
ii
honestly
don't
know
she's
never
stood
alone
against
something
like
this
before
