let
'em
surprise
you
thanks
rupert
well
it's
good
to
know
we're
not
walking
into
the
unholy
feast
of
something
or
other
or
i
bet
there
we
can
get
in
that
way
i'm
sure
you
would
have
i
think
we
have
a
plan
buffy
you
go
in
first
let
'em
get
a
look
at
the
slayer
xander
the
nimzowitsch
defense
let's
see
if
i

hmmmmmm
mate

time

anya
you
back
up
buffy
i'll
be
the
surprise
guest
everyone
lets
show
these
fiends
that
they
came
to
the
wrong
town
you
got
two
of
them
and
that
second
one
was
ready
for
you
you
should
feel
pretty
good
don't
worry
you
know
it
only
matters
that
you
do
your
best
ok
guys
that's
enough
vampires
only
form
nests
to
make
hunting
easier
they're
not
big
on
the
cooperation
they
mostly
like
to
hang
out
all
creepy
and
alone
in
the
shadows
don't
you
agree
spike
what
are
you
doing
here
careful
he's
still
pretty
dangerous
spike
you're
the
worst
type
of
scum
the
second
you're
back
to
your
old
tricks
well
let's
just
say
before
you
even
sniff
out
your
first
victim
you'll
be
pretty
indistinguishable
from
oh
what
should
we
say
instant
soup
mix
buffy
you
know
what
i
think

i
don't
think
this
about
you
being
angry
with
faith
i
think
you're
angry
with
riley
sure
i
mean
you
have
this
amazing
connection
with
him
and
then
at
the
one
moment
when
it
matters
the
most
he
looks
into
your
eyes
and
he
doesn't
even
see
that
it's
not
you
looking
back
at
him
i
know
you
know
that
but
you
have
to
believe
it
buffy
if
there's
any
part
of
you
that's
blaming
riley
for
what
happened
it
seems
like
there's
a
part
of
you
that
needs
to
forgive
him
hi
karen
thank
you
oh
is
that
my
book
well
i
could
uh
so
what
do
think
buffy
i
mean
if
i'm
wrong
smack
me
karen
with
a
k
will
lend
you
a
book
and
it's
pretty
heavy
heh
he
does
it's
not
going
to
be
easy
buffy
but
you
guys
are
very
special
together
that's
worth
a
little
hard
work
if
you
really
want
it
thank
you
colonel
men
before
we
can
locate
adam
we
need
to
understand
him
better
and
there's
something
that's
bothered
me
almost
from
the
start
he
doesn't
eat
we've
known
him
to
kill
but
never
to
eat
the
kill
so
i've
pulled
some
of
professor
walsh's
original
design
schematics
and
i've
found
something

his
power
source
is
not
biological
at
all
it's
here
the
design
attempts
to
hide
it
but
i
believe
that
there's
a
small
reservoir
of
uranium
235
essentially
forever
it
also
means
that
cutting
off
his
head
is
useless
killing
adam
means
annihilating
him
completely
but
first
we
have
to
find
him
she's
ready
to
forget
it
you
better
be
ready
too
she's
scared
scared
of
what
you're
thinking
about
she
knows
that
faith
is

experienced
have
you
let
her
know
that
good
evening
everyone
i'd
to
dedicate
this
to
some
friends
of
mine

a
very
special
couple
who've
been
going
through
a
tough
time
when
i
hear
that
serenade
in
blue
i'm
somewhere
in
another
world
alone
with
you
sharing
all
the
joys
we
used
to
know
many
moons
ago
once
again
your
face
comes
back
to
me
just
like
the
theme
of
some
forgotten
melody
in
the
album
of
my
memory
serenade
in
blue
seems
like
only
yesterday

a
small
caf√©
a
crowded
floor
and
as
we
danced
the
night
away

i
hear
you
say
forever
more

and
then
the
song
became
a
sigh
forever
more
became
goodbye

but
you
remain
in
my
heart
tell
me
darling
is
there
still
a
spot
karen
that's
your
name
isn't
it
ii
signed
my
book
for
you
tell
me
what
hurt
you
karen
i
can
help
let's
get
you
warmed
up
that's
all
right
sergeant
i
have
it
under
control
karen
i
know
you're
scared
but
i
need
to
hear
your
description
again
that
must
have
been
very
frightening
i'm
so
sorry
a
mark
well
this
is
a
clue
i've
heard
of
this
it's
not
a
demon
just
a
monster
not
much
more
than
an
animal
it
sticks
to
the
woods
doesn't
come
near
populated
areas
actually
i
think
karen
simply
startled
it
probably
more
afraid
of
you
than
you
were
of
it
i'll
patrol
but
you
don't
need
to
worry
about
it
i
can
handle
it
on
my
own
now
let's
see
about
getting
karen
a
ride
home
be
right
there
is
this
a
private
conversation
or
can
mr
july
sit
in
buffy
then
i'll
explain
buffy
is
right
i
do
have
a
history
with
the
creature
the
monster
the
problem
is
every
time
i
face
it
my
mind
becomes
sort
of
confused
there's
some
kind
of
power
it
possesses
maybe
i
just
knows
it
takes
all
my
energy
to
try
and
fight
the
confusion
that's
why
i
had
his
mark
tattooed
on
me
so
that
i
wouldn't
underestimate
it
next
time
i'm
sure
it's
left
town
by
now
that's
been
its
pattern
sure
let's
do
that
goodbye
that's
enough
of
the
creepy
small
talk
we're
looking
for
a
monster
every
demon
in
this
town's
gunning
for
you
right
now
so
i
figure
you're
probably
keeping
pretty
good
track
of
them
big
arms
mark
on
its
head
have
you
seen
it
we're
not
getting
anything
out
of
him
that
was
very
good
yeah
don't
want
that
to
happen
come
on
we've
got
a
monster
to
i
think
you're
going
to
have
to
handle
this
one
solo
you'll
know
you
used
to
and
the
more
you
hurt
it
the
more
i'll
lose
my
hi
i
wasn't
sure
you'd
come
over
everyone's
mostly
forgetting
but
i
think
some
people
are
kind
of
angry
nobody's
even
talking
to
me
and
the
twins
moved
out
after
the
thing
with
the
bell
tower
and
the
gun
i
went
to
counseling
you
know
other
kids
with
problems
aand
one
of
them
had
this
spell
he
glossed
right
over
the
monster
well
anyway
i
just

ii
just
wanted
to
apologize
nobody
was
supposed
to
get
hurt
you
weren't
you
weren't
socks
we
were
friends
yeah
right
hey
hey
buffy
you
remember
i
gave
you
some
advice
uh
no
about
you
and
riley
i
mean
things
are
starting
to
blur
but
this
cool
thing
i
said
um
that
i
don't
really
remember
i
think
it's
right
i
think
it's
kind
of
the
same
thing
you
just
said
to
me
about
things
taking
work
good
because
it's
true
what
you
have
is
really
complicated
but
it's
worth
it
i
think
that's
what
i
said
