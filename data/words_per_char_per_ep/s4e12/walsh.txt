so
the
slayer
we
thought
you
were
a
myth
and
to
think
all
that
time
you
were
sitting
in
my
class
well
most
of
those
times
i
always
knew
you
could
do
better
than
a
b
minus
now
i
understand
your
energies
were
directed
in
the
same
places
as
ours
in
fact
it's
only
our
methods
that
differ
we
use
the
latest
in
scientific
technology
and
stateoftheart
weaponry
and
you
if
i
understand
correctly
poke
them
with
a
sharp
stick
oh

i'm
heh
quite
sure
of
that
as
i'm
just
as
sure
that
we
can
learn
much
from
each
other
i'm
working
on
getting
you
clearance
to
come
into
the
initiative
i
think
you'll
find
the
results
of
our
operation
most
impressive
agent
finn
here
alone
has
killed
or
captured
how
many
is
it
what
about
you
how
many
hostiles
would
you
say
you've
slain
yeah
can
i
help
you
with
something
mr




i'm
sorry
buffy's
not
here
but
if
i
see
her



i
don't
lecture
from
the
text
book
but
i'm
glad
she's
inspired
by
the
material
she's
bright
all
she's
really
been
lacking
is
encouragement
in
the
academic
sect
and
if
it's
true
about
hiking
ergo
it
must
be
true
about
life
i
think
i
do
know
her
and
i
have
found
her
to
be
a
unique
woman
she's
very
selfreliant
very
independent
which
is
not
always
a
good
thing
i
think
it
can
be
unhealthy
to
take
on
adult
roles
too
early
what
i
suspect
i'm
seeing
is
a
reaction
to
the
absence
of
a
male
role
model
buffy
clearly
lacks
a
strong
father
figure
i'm
sorry
i
have
things
to
do
i'll
tell
buffy
her
friend
was
looking
for
her
so
she
walks
in
and
the
rules
just
suddenly
break
be
careful
with
her
she
reacts
on
instinct
there's
no
discipline
there
her
loyalties
are
uncertain
oh
no
oh
no
spontaneous
poetic
exclamations
lord
spare
me
college
boys
in
love
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
i
think
you're
probably
right
