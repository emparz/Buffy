while

she's
absolutely
the
smartest
person
i've
ever
met
oh

stories
it's
no
big
really
hey
who
wants
ice
cream
look
if
you've
been
fighting
since
you
were
fifteen
you'd
have
a
hefty
resume'
too
i
know
wow
the
point
is
that
that
we
have
different
amounts
of
experience
you
know
and
plus
i
do
have
that
whole
preternatural
slayer
strength
deal
that
all
depends
on
your
meaning
are
you
maybe
a
little
too
are
you
sure
riley
are
you
hurt
i'm
so
sorry
ii
didn't
mean
to
uh
i
like
pancakes
'cause
they're
stackable
ooo
and
waffles
'cause
you
can
put
things
in
the
little
holes
if
you
wanted
to
hey
i
didn't
hear
you
come
in
last
night
where
were
you
yikes
someone
else
doing
majiks
hmm
i'll
tell
giles
about
it
or
maybe
i'll
tell
maggie
she
seemed
kind
of
interested
in
learning
the
mystical
side
of
the
whole
demon
hunting
biz
i
did
i
didn't
well
i
didn't
at
first
because
riley
said
not
to
and


and
then
meow
cat
out
of
the
bag
and
ii
guess
i
just
forgot
that
he
didn't
know
i'll
make
it
up
to
him
when
i
see
him
tomorrow
i'm
spending
today
with
riley
it's
just
going
so
well
right
now
i
think
i
hope
i
sort
of
kicked
him
across
the
room
last
night
well
we
were
sparring
and
he
said
not
to
hold
back
and
he's
a
little
dented
but
he
said
he
was
okay
with
it
and
i
think
he's
okay
with
it
dodo
you
think
he's
okay
with
it
right
i
held
back
a
little
so
it
had
pointy
things
what
kind
of
pointy
things
giles
looks
like
xander
wasn't
the
only
one
to
get
a
visitor
today
okay
there's
a
demon
and
giles
is
gone
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
he's
hurt
i
mean
there's
no
blood
anywhere
so
maybe
the
demon
just
took
him
somewhere
we'll
figure
it
out
oh
this
one
has
tufty
ears
riley
what
are
you
doing
here
this
is
giles'
apartment
he's
missing
the
calls
did
anyone
see
what
did
it
we'll
get
him
back
uh
we
have
stuff
pictures



thanks
i
just
wish
i
knew
what
i
needed
i
keep
thinking
let's
ask
giles
and
then
i
remember
mucous
how
do
i
kill
it
a
demon
that
steals
a
car
has
a
reason
a
purpose
but
it
doesn't
sound
like
these
fyarl
demons
are
really
big
independent
thinkers
so
will
the
spells
that
are
going
wrong



could
they
be
caused
by
someone
using
majiks
to
control
a
demon
making
this
fyarl
demon
attack
giles
okay
willow
xander
stay
here
who's
ever
controlling
this
demon
may
call
and
ask
for
a
ransom
give
them
anything
they
want
riley
you
and
i
are
going
to
the
magic
shop
maybe
they
needed
supplies
uh
something
silver



then
i'll
have
to
put
some
muscle
behind
it
okay
credit
card
slips
sales
receipt

do
not
have
