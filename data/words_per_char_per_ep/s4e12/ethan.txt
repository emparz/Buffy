through
clear
that
something's
harming

as
bright
as
steel
things
like
that
they're
scared
there's
something
called
314
that's
got
them
scared
most
of
all
the
kind
of
scared
that
turns
to
angry
i
know
we're
not
particularly
fond
of
each
other
rupert
but
we
are
a
couple
of
old
mystics
this
knew
outfit
it's
blundering
into
new
places
it
doesn't
belong
it's
throwing
the
worlds
out
of
balance
and
that's
way
beyond
chaos

headed
quite
literally

hell

an
hour

to
do
to
me
