this
please
okay
here
we
go
early
to

early
to
rise
balanced
breakfast

new
beginning
discipline

i
thought
i
told
you
to
do
your
homework
please
don't
lie
to
me

homework
at
home
please

your
stuff
it's
really
important
that
dawn
finishes
her
schoolwork
right
now
it's
really
important
that
dawn
finishes
her
schoolwork
right
now
look
willow
i
know
that
you
mean
well
but
you
just
don't
understand
and
there's
no
way
that
you
could
i'm
more
than
stressed
out
i'm
freaked
out
i
don't
think
so
i
can't
do
it
will
don't
worry
it's
not
like
i
don't
have
a
life
i
do
i
have
dawn's
life
ready
okay
so
ii
think
the
next
step
is
to
make
a
chart
a
schedule
i'll
write
down
all
the
things
you're
supposed
to
do
and
when
you
have
to
do
them
and
then
i'll
leave
a
box
next
to
it
which
you
can
mark
with
an
x
when
you've
accomplished
the
task
what
you
want
gold
stars
okay
you
can
have
gold
stars
i'm
just
trying
to
give
you
a
normal
life
this
is
for
real
dawn
it's
a
chart
not
a
graph
and
you
are
real
damn
it
dawn
this
is
serious
because
they'll
take
you
away
they'll
take
you
away
from
me
that's
what
your
principal
told
me
when
you
weren't
in
the
room
if
i
can't
make
you
go
to
school
then
i
won't
be
found
fit
to
be
your
legal
guardian
i
don't
know
dad
maybe

or
foster
care

i
i
didn't
really
want
to
ask
i
just
did
hey
will
i'm
so
sorry
tara
i'm
sorry
it
took
me
so
long
but
dawn's
safe
with
spike
so
ii
can
stay
as
long
as
you
need
will
you
just
have
to
rest
okay
right
now
there's
nothing
you
can
do
no
no
way
you
cannot
even
think
about
taking
on
glory
no
you
have
to
let
her
get
away
with
it
even
i'm
no
match
for
her
you
know
that
you're
not
and
i
won't
let
you
go
this
is
not
the
time
when
we
have
a
chance
we'll
fight
her
when
we
have
a
chance
you
wouldn't
last
five
minutes
with
her
willow
she's
a
god
it's
the
only
way
can
i
do
anything
no
sweetheart
it
is
not
your
fault
she
was
looking
to
go
all
paybacky
on
glory
for
a
minute
but
i
cooled
her
down
a
little
actually
a
lot
no
i
explained
that
there
was
no
point
what
you
think
she'd

no
i
told
willow
it
would
be
like
suicide
they
used
to
bow
down
to
gods
things
change
chicken
salad
eggplant
that's
me

salami
with

ew
peanut
butter
