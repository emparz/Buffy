will
not
betray

i
will
never
talk
no

what
heinous
torture

talking
quite
a
lot
just
not
about
the
right
things
tell
us
why
you're
here
no
words
shall
pass
my
lips
that
will
bring
peril
to
glorificus

glory
fetches
the
key
too

late
glorificus
will
find
the
witch

do
to
stop
her

have
found
her
by
now
