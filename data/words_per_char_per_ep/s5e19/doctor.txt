i've
been
calling
you
for
two
weeks

wanna

i'm
sorry
to
fire
you

also
tell
me
that
the
dog
ate
your
homework

maybe
eating
twinkies

that
there's
really
a
wicked
demonic
creature
living
inside
you
that
takes
control
of
your
body
and
forces
you
to
do
its
bidding
take
responsibility
for
your
actions

keep
her
for
the
night

can
get
her
released

one
night
in
the
psych
ward

for
observation
we'll
keep
an
eye
on
her

a
couple
basic
tests

you
can
take
her
