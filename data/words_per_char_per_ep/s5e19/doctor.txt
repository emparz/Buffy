is
a
pleasant
surprise

not
late
sure
you
can
also
tell
me
that
the
dog
ate
your
homework
or
maybe
eating
twinkies
made
you
do
it
or

maybe
yeah
that
there's
really
a
wicked
demonic
creature
living
inside
you
that
takes
control
of
your
body
and
forces
you
to
do
its
bidding
take
responsibility
for
your
actions
ben
unfortunately
no
hospital
policy
dictates
we
keep
her
for
the
night
she
your
sister
well
you
can
get
her
released
first
thing
in
the
morning
but
she's
gotta
spend
one
night
in
the
psych
ward
just
for
observation
we'll
keep
an
eye
on
her
do
a
couple
basic
tests
then
you
can
take
her
home

that
sound
fair

i'll
send
a
nurse

in
a
few
minutes
