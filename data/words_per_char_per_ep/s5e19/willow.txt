democracy
you
don't
say
we
were
acting
out
a
geometry
problem
'cause
i
read
this
really
neat
article
that
said
kids
learn
math
better
if
you
you
stimulate
their
uh
visual
learning
pattern
you
know
using
the
right
side
of
the
brain
instead
of
just
the
left
stuff
like
that
so
we
made
a
triangle
with
our
bodies
and
that's
when
i
called
xander
obtuse
and
he
got
really
grumpy
and
then
dawn
said
we
were
acute
triangle
and
well
hilarity
ensued
please
don't
be
grouchy
with
her
who
among
us
can
resist
the
allure
of
really
funny
math
puns
yeah
i
know
but
we
were
having
good
clean
educational
fun
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
was
all
gloom
and
doom
and
the
outlawing
of
human
triangles
i
know
it
is
and
i'm
a
big
fan
of
school
you
know
me
i'm
like
go
school
it's
your
birthday
or
something
to
that
effect
i
do
so
understand
it

you're
stressed
out
yeah
well
maybe
you
need
a
break
to
defreak
hey
you
could
go
to
the
world's
culture
fair
if
you
want
to
with
me
and
tara
come
on
you
can
bring
dawn
it'll
be
fun
good
educationaltype
fun
in
a
discipliney
sort
of
way
it
wasn't
anything
really
buffy
was
just
a
little
crabby
at
dawn
about
her
schoolwork
yeah
sure
it
is
i'd
totally
be
blowing
off
classes
if
i
were
in
dawnie's
shoes
buffy
what
yeah
but
not
in
a
miss
minchin's
select
seminary
for
girls
way
i
mean
she's
just
gonna
make
dawnie
more
rebellious
yeah
i
know
that
no
i
just

i

i
know
i
can't
know
what
you
went
through
but
i
just

it's
no
big
no
no
no
it's
okay
this
whole
buffy
thing
let's
just
forget
it
no
i
was
snippy
gal
it's
just

i
know
i
can't

on
some
level

it's
like
my
opinion
isn't
worth
anything
because
i
haven't
been
through

i
didn't
lose
my
mom
so
i
don't
know
no
sort
of
i
mean
i
just
feel
like
thethe
junior
partner
you've
been
doing
everything
longer
than
me
you've
been
out
longer

you've
been
practicing
witchcraft
way
longer
that's
a
weird
word
it
frightens
you
i
frighten
you
well
i
took
psych
101
i
mean
i
took
it
from
an
evil
government
scientist
who
was
skewered
by
her
frankensteinlike
creation
before
the
final
but
i
know
what
a
freudian
slip
is
ddon't
you
trust
me
that's
not
what
i
mean
i
don't
feel
real
multicultural
right
now
wh

what
is
it
about
me
that
you
don't
trust
where
i'm
heading
no
i
think
you're
being
pretty
clear
this
isn't
about
the
witchcraft
it's
about
the
other
changes
in
my
life
when

i
change
back
yeah
this
is
a
college
thing
just
a
a
little
experimentation
before
i
get
over
the
thrill
and
head
back
to
boys'
town
you
think
that
i'm
really
sorry
that
i
didn't
establish
my
lesbo
street
cred
