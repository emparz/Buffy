i'm
hungry
we
got
this
part
right
that's
for
sure
lot
of
sucky
things
in
this
dimension

bubble
baths
not
one
of
'em
know
what
i
mean
i
wasn't
talking
to
you
eww
yeah
right
like
any
of
you
have
ever
bathed
anyway
so
what
i
think
we
have
here
is
a
failure
for
you
to
do
your
frickin'
jobs
pardon
my
french
mimosa
mmm

vitamins
so
i
think
you
better
rack
your
little
minion
brains
and
tell
me
everything
that
you
saw
when
you
were
spying
on
buffy
and
her
wacky
pals
everything
mm
then
i'll
figure
out
who
the
key
is
so
it's
her
under
our
noses
all
this
time
i
like
the
detail
work
those
monks
did
quirks
foibles
passions

it's
all
so
cute
so

human
you
know
pretty
convincing
really
but
not
convincing
enough
you
all
know
your
assignments
i
think
it's
time
to
collect
the
key
is
this
seat
taken
oh
this
is
nice
just
hangin'
out
just
us
girls
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
don't
you
don't

make
a
sound
nah
they
won't
help
you
i'd
kill
them
you
know
that
there's
no
one
here
that
can
stop
me
i'll
kill
her
and

and
them
i'll
kill
him
and
her
and
her
and
it'll
all
be
your
fault
kinda
funny
isn't
it
all
these
people
here
and

no
one
who
can
do
a
thing
not
a
person
who
can
help
you
but
that's
people
for
ya
they're
pretty
worthless
but
keys
on
the
other
hand

keys
are
worth
a
very
lot
you
lying
little
tramp
you're
not
the
key
you're
nothing
just
another
worthless
human
being
if
you
tell
me
who
the
key
really
is

i'll
let
you
go
think
about
it
you
think
your
hand
hurts
imagine
what
you'd
feel
with
my
fingers
wiggling
in
your
brain
it
doesn't
kill
you
what
it
does

is
make
you
feel
like
you're
in
a
noisy
little
dark
room

naked
and
ashamed

and
there
are
things
in
the
dark
that
need
to
hurt
you
because
you're
bad

little
pinching
things
that
go
in
your
ears

and
crawl
on
the
inside
of
your
skull
and
you
know

that
if
the
noise
and
the
crawling
would
stop

that
you
could
remember
how
to
get
out
but
you
never
ever
will
who

is

the
key
fine
let's
get
crazy
you
know
i
think
i'm
a
little
buzzed
from
eating
that
witch
what
a
mind
she
has
mmm
nummy
treat
did
anybody
order
an
apocalypse
uhh
it's
the
lover
that's
so
cute
is
that
it
is
that
the
best
you
can
do
you
think
i
care
about
all
this
the
apartment
the
clothes
now
sucking
on
your
girlfriend's
mind
that
was
something
to
treasure
what's
this
bag
of
tricks
now
this
is
getting
weak
and
so
are
you
honey
aren't
ya
know
what
they
used
to
do
to
witches
lover
crucify
'em
that
witch
barely
slowed
me
down
this
isn't
over
you
hear
me
it
isn't
over
i
told
you
this
wasn't
over
