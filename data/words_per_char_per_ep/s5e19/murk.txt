uh
begging
your
pardon
and
begging
in
general
but

were
you
talking
to
me
oh
but
we
do
your
scrumptiousness
we
bathe
in
your
splendiforous
radiance
your
aromatic
glory
how
about
you
shut
up
and
listen
to
me
you
disgusting
little
fools
okay
now
i
asked
for
the
key
and
you
brought
me
a
vampire
a
pulseless
impure
folliclyfried
vampire
loofah
