sort
of
forget
that
he's
gone

central
republic
of
whereinthehell

of
piling
up
on
the
buffy
highway

can
do
it

there
she'll
be
great
so
how
goes
the
slaying
in
any
other
room

frightening
declaration

welcome
distraction

us
all
about
the
killing

not
gonna
let
you
pull
me
into
this
whatever
the
issue
is
between
you

figure
it
out
without
me
spike
don't
let
me
stop
you
from
not
being
here
uhhuh
go
away
are
you
talking
to
me
hoping
that
i'll
get
so
depressed
that
i'll
impale
myself
on
a
fork
right
in
front
of
you
hey
those
are
mine
what
no
nothing
to
do
with
buffy
what
are
you
talking
about
what
does
buffy
have
to
do
with
anything
what
grudges
and
they
get
in
these
fights
and
they're
both
looking
at
me
like
i'm
the
referee
also
sometimes
i'll
say
something
about
anya
and
willow'll
get
this
look
this
um
what
the
hell
do
you
see
in
her
look
well
she
was
insane
then
it's
like
well
i
get
all
torn
because
willow's
my
best
friend
and
i
really
value
her
opinion
but
uh
anya's
my
girlfriend
you
know
i
don't
know
what
so
uh

think
i
should
run
and
get
buffy
i'm
gonna
run
and
get
buffy
or
maybe
you
could
fight
him
what
shut
up
um

listen
well
we
can
take
care
of
the
hungry
so
how's
about
you
just
sit
down
in
one
of
the

sturdier
chairs
and
we
can

have
a
calm
talk
and
something
to
eat
well
not
so
much
but
maybe

some
roast
pigs
and

stags
and

much
hearty
grog
uh
a
big
guy
hammer
i
think
i
noticed
him
you
dated
him
but
but
you
seem
to
enjoy
the
the
being
a
troll
no
get
away
from
them
you
are
not
touching
these
women
no
you
are
one
crazy
troll
i

i'm
not
choosing
between
my
girlfriend
and
my
best
friend
that's
insane
troll
logic
i'm
not
choosing
you
really
dated
him
but
you
like
me
better
right
the
place
is
trashed
enough
anyway
