i'm
envious
mr
giles
a
trip
to
england
sounds
so
exciting
and
exotic
unless
you're
english
i
said
quirky
hellebore
one
of
my
favorites
there's
this
thing
you
can
do
where
you
create
light
and
we
thought
what
if
you
could
make
like
simulated
sunlight
only
it
won't
be
presto
exactly
you
don't
wanna
look
right
at
it
though
it's
a
book
this
cat
does
all
this
mischief
willow
maybe
we
should
just
pay
you
really
shouldn't
pull
him
into
this
um
you
know
i
think
uh
maybe
maybe
you
guys
have
some
stuff
you
need
to
work
out
you
know
just
really

talk
i
think
this
one's
gonna
be
kind
of
fun
greek
art's
gonna
touch
on
so
many
things

mythology
history
philosophy
that
was
just
you
know
um
enthusiasm
we'll
sit
farther
back
next
time
hmm
is
it
that
bad
willow
says
that
things
always
happen
for
a
reason
i
guess
we
could
she
might
still
be
at
the
magic
shop
i
was
there
earlier
and
she
and
anya
kinda
got
in
this
little
squabble

xander
and
i
sort
of
cleared
out
he
was
pretty
upset
oh
no
ii
said
that
all
wrong
it
was
nothing
willow
and
anya
were
sort
of
fighting
and
then
xander
kind
of
snapped
at
both
of
them
and
he
left
ummm

no
not
left
her
left
her
he
just
left
it
was
only
a
little
thing
it
oh
dear
oh
i
think
i
think
they'll
be
fine
what
they're
not
back
there
either
they're
gone
buffy
something's
been
here
and
willow's
gone
there's
a
world
without
shrimp
i'm
allergic
