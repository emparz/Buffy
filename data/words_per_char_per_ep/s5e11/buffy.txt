drool

you're
gonna
talk
to
them
about
right
answer
me
but
you're
gonna
tell
them
about
the
key
that
glory's
looking
for
something
called
the
key
i
know
it's
just
i
trust
these
watchers
about
as
far
as

you
could
throw
them
i'm
just
freaked
about
the
idea
of
giving
them
any
information
that
could
possibly
lead
them
to
dawn
it's
okay
you
can
say
his
name
i'm
doing
all
right
these
things
happen
people
break
up
and
they
move
on

for
a
while
it
feels
like
the
end
of
the
world
you
know
but

big
picture
not
so
huge
i
just
said
it
feels
like
the
end
of
the
world
don't
you
listen
i'm
teasing
sort
of
i'll
be
okay
look
if
it
help
you
find
out
something
about
glory
i'm
thrilled
to
have
you
gone
look
don't
worry
about
the
shop
we'll
take
care
of
it
we
can
open
and
close
and
and
we'll
deal
with
everyone
i
killed
something
in
a
convent
last
night
pretty
standard
vampire
staking
ooh
but
i
met
a
nun
and
she
let
me
try
on
her
wimple
you
you
with
the
actual
clothing
who
are
you
dawn
come
look
at
this
no
more
bathrobe
i
don't
think
the
rest
of
us
will
miss
it
much
either
maybe
we
should
burn
it
let's
go
i
think
we've
tired
her
out
playing
soccer
don't
touch
anything
yeah
it
wasn't
like
that
i
was
never
angry
with
him
okay
that's
a
lie
but
it's
not
like
i
don't
want
to
see
his
face
it
wasn't
really
so
fast
him
leaving
according
to
everyone
who
isn't
me
it
was
kind
of
gradual
no
stop
being
insightful
it's
creepy
it
hurts
in
all
kinds
of
horrible
ways
in
the
way
where
i'm
furious
at
him

in
the
way
where
i
blame
myself

and
all
the
little
ways
i
imagine

how
i
could
have
fixed
things
i
hope
so
yes
it
has
to
i'll
just
keep
going
like
i
have
been
and
every
day
it'll
get
a
little
bit
better
not
really
but
it'll
be
better
soon
but
you
never
know
maybe
he'll
come
back
maybe
he'll
hate
the
jungle

or
maybe
he'll
want
to
give
it
another
try
i
could

say
all
the
things
i
didn't
get
to
say
new
semester
new
classes
whole
new
vistas
of
knowledge
to
be
confused
and
intimidated
by
the
professor
spit
too
much
when
he
talked
it
was
like
being
at
sea
world
the
first
five
rows
will
get
wet
it
seemed
very
much
like
saliva
good
plan
i
need
to
keep
this
course
the
only
other
thing
that
fits
into
my
schedule
is
central
american
geopolitics
and
no
thank
you
i
even
hear
the
word
jungle
all
i
can
think
of
is
him
you
know
is
that
the
one
riley's
in
really
don't
need
a
daily
200
knife
in
the
heart
sort
of
but
i'm
starting
to
get
perspective
on
the
whole
situation
you
know
maybe
riley's

where
he's
supposed
to
be
you
know
maybe
he
needed

to
be
where
he
was
needed
but
you
ever
notice
people
only
say
that
about
bad
things
but
not
for
me
the
furrowed
brow
what
do
you
say
we
go
pick
up
willow
and
indulge
ourselves
in
a
little
afterschool
hamburger
anya
and
and
xander
are
in
trouble
he
left
xander
left
anya
little
thing
see
the
thing
is
the

little
things
get
bigger
you
know
and
and
and
and
if
you
don't
catch
the
little
thing
and
then
boom
you
have
this
this
this
whole
huge
thing
not
not
not
them
with
the
little
things
they
can't
break
up
they
have
a
beautiful
love
they
have
a
miraculous
love
a
miraculous
love
willow
anya
don't
worry
we'll
get
her
back
i
promise

on
this
thing's
probably

a
huge
trail
i'm
here
what's
going
on
where
did
he
come
from
you
did
this

dated
a
troll

he
xander
follow
him
anya
willow

the
magic
shop

a
spell
that
will
actually
stop
him
what
are
you
doing

want
credit
for
not
feeding
on
bleeding
disaster
victims

disgusting
so
your
power's
in
your
hammer
their
love

some
magicks
