second
left

said
it
there
that
parked
car
we're
still
on
his
trail
no
one
made
him
he
must
have
been
trapped
in
that
crystal
and
you
released

look
just
find
the
reversal
spell
and
hurry
look
what
he
did
to
that
lamppost
well
i
don't
know
how
to
put
the
top
up
i
only
just
figured
out
what
the
left
pedal
does
it
makes
us
stop
well
i
couldn't
know
if
i
could
until
i
tried
could
i
troll
troll
on
the
loose
now
hold
on
i'm
gonna
press
the
right
pedal
harder
i
expect
us
to
accelerate
it's
likely
we're
going
very
fast
you
should
have
listened
to
me
and
not
done
the
spell
giles
put
me
in
charge
xander
agreed
well
what
do
you
mean
by
that
find
that
spell
quickly
xander
you
shouldn't
be
here
there's
a
troll
willow
stole
ingredients
and
released
him
from
a
purple
crystal
he's
a
troll
well
we
can
stop
him
willow
do
the
spell
uh
um
well
he
wasn't
a
troll
then
you
know
he
was
just
a
big
dumb
guy
and

well
you
know
he
cheated
on
me
and
i
made
him
into
a
troll
which
by
the
way
is
how
i
got
the

job
as
a
vengeance
demon
in
case
we
need
'em
i'm
getting
more
of
all
the
things
you
stole
what
rules
are
stupid
i
am
a
human
and
there
are

many
humans
who
are
stranger
than
me
well
now
that's
a
very
complicated
proced
oh
you
think
i'm
gonna
hurt
xander
i
would
never
hurt
xander
you
really
think
i
would
do
that
i
was
a
demon
then
and
and
i
don't
even
have
any
powers
now
is
this
the
spell
i
don't
do
magic
now
you're
the
one
with
that
kind
of
power
in
fact
d'hoffryn
offered
you
my
old
job
you're
closer
to
being
a
vengeance
demon
than
i
am
maybe
xander
should
be
afraid
of
you
oh
and
you
don't
want
anyone
else
to
have
him
i
know
what
broke
up
him
and
cordelia
you
know
it
was
you
and
your
lips
why
not
but
you're
always
doing
everything
you
can
to
to
point
out
how
much
i'm
an
outsider
you've
known
him
since
you
were
squalling
infants
together
you'll
always
know
him
better
than
i
do
you
could
sweep
in
and
and
poison
his
mind
against
me
well
i'm
not
either
go
xander
i
love
you
olaf
no
no
choose
me
just
don't
take
him
don't
take
xander
buffy
buffy
the
hammer
the
strength's
in
the
hammer
how
can
i
help
i
don't
know
how
hey
olaf
you're
as
inadequate
a
troll
as
you
were
a
boyfriend
uh
yyou're
hairy
and
unattractive
and
even
women
trolls
are
put
off
by
your
various
odors
your
menacing
stance
is
merely
alarming
and
your
roar
is
less
than
fullthroated
hey
good
job
oh
yeah
i
forgot
he
still
has
all
that
troll
strength
poor
baby
yes
yes
oh
and
willow
likes
you
too
but
not
in
a
sexy
way
you
know
'cause
she's
gay
and
she's
not
gonna
try
to
break
us
up
so
you
know
it's
all
okay
the
land
of
the
trolls
he'll
like
it
there
full
of
trolls
it's
possible
that
he's
in
the
land
of
perpetual
wednesday

or
the
crazy
melty
land

or
you
know
the
world
without
shrimp
