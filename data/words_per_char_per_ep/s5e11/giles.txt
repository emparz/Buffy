all
right
switch
left
lead
uh
if
you
mean
are
they
gonna
help
us
find
out
something
about
glory

i
saw
that
coming
you're
dropping
your
shoulder
uh
the
resources
that
the

watchers
council
has
at
their
disposal
i
mean
the
central
library
alone
is
just
i'm
sorry
but
we
we've
really
exhausted
the
materials
i
have
here
and
we're
coming
up
empty
you're
you're
still
dropping
your
shoulder
i
can
see
when
you're
gonna
go
with
your
right
you're
doing
it
again
ow
let's
let's
take
a
break
i
i'm
not
gonna
mention
dawn's
name
i
wouldn't
do
that
i
promise
well
knowing
her
goal
is
is
crucial
i
mean
iiif
anything
helps
them
uncover
her
origins
her
her
plans
thank
you
very
much
truly
buffy
if
i
saw
an
alternative

if
if
the
initiative
were
still
around
i'd
consider
using
them
but
they're
gone
and
then
riley
was
was
uh
the
last
link
we
had
to
the
government
sorry
i
didn't
mean
to
not
so
huge
oh
well
i
do
hate
to
go
if
you're
feeling
badly
yes
yes
everybody
seems
delighted
about
it
you
ah
wwell
it's
quite
a
lot
for
one
person
to
take
care
of
well
ii
mean
the
trash
men
for
example
i
mean
they
they
they've
been
making
such
a
mess
in
the
back
alley
the
recycling
people
can't
get
in
there
to
collect
well
somebody
has
to
talk
to
them
um
anya
while
while
i
completely
trust
you
uh
uh
to
take
care
of
the
inventory
and
the
money
um

dealing
with
people
requires
a
certain
uh

finesse
perhaps
i'd
better
call
the
airline
schedule
an
earlier
flight
back
excuse
me
i
cringe
to
think
what
the
place
would
have
looked
like
if
i'd
been
away
for
longer
than
three
days
yes
'cause
nothing
could
possibly
go
wrong
with
that
well
they
don't
know
it

yet
i
mean
they
have
no
record
of
of
glory
or
anyone
like
her
but
uh
based
on
the
information
that
i've
given
them
they're
gonna
look
into
it
um
they
might
have
something
soon
yes
you
you
know
all
of
this
well
they're
interested
certainly
and
uh
full
of
theories
most
of
them

nonsensical
no
it
is
disorienting
i
don't
know
