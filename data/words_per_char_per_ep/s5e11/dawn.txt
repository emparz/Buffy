whoa
it
was
getting
a
little
ripe
mom
it
would
keep
the
bugs
away
whatcha
doin'
can
i
hang
out
in
here
you
took
down
his
pictures
i

i
think
i
would've
done
that
sooner
like
boom
don't
wanna
see
that
face
again
buffy
it
wasn't
like
that
i
was
never
angry
with
him
okay
that's
a
lie
but
it's
not
like
i
don't
want
to
see
his
face
i
was
just
starting
to
kinda
like
the
guy
and
then

gone
so
fast
oh
does
that
make
it
any
better
because
you
should
have
noticed
earlier
it'll
get
better
won't
it
really
every
day
it
still
feels
all
sudden
to
me
with
him
gone
where
no
one
can
talk
to
him
