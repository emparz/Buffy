that
at
the
wedding

we
'cause
there's
this
last
thread
of
dignity
i've
been
desperately
clinging
to
yeah
you
know
some
days
are
harder
than
the
really
hard
days
it's
easier
like
this
though
when
i'm
not
alone

that's
not

it's
okay
we
know
you've
been
all
tied
up
with
your
job
and
the
slaying
and
despite
that
i
succumb
to
the
beat
the
funky
monkey
claims
another
victim
tara
what
are
you
doing
here
i
mean

uh
it's
okay
for
you
to
be
here
if
you
have
things
that

you
have
to
be
here
for
only
if
you
don't
stretch
first
the
brekenkrieg
grimoire
light
reading
no
it's
okay
i
i
didn't
expect
you
to
stop
doing
magic
just
because

you
don't
have
to
hide
it
i'm
not

i'm
i'm
doing
better

spells
for
thirtytwo
days
i
can
even
go
to
the
magic
shop
now
as
long
as
someone's
with
me
at
all
times
but
uh
but
it's
better
now
it
really
is
you

if
you
were
checking
on
me
