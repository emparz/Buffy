i'm

sleeping
over
at
janice's
i
didn't
think
you'd
care
you're
never
home
so
her
mom's
cooking
mexican
she's
gonna
teach
me
how
to
make
real
tortillas
not
like
i
knew
you'd
be
around
what
time
is
it
what's
wrong
why
are
you
talking
like
this
buffy
oh
my
god
is
she
all
right
the
police
but

what's
going
to
happen
they'll
take
you
away
won't
they
no
you're
not
you're
never
here
you
can't
even
stand
to
be
around
me
you
don't
want
to
be
here
with
me
you
didn't
want
to
come
back
i
know
that
you
were
happier
where
you
were
you
want
to
go
away
again
then
go
you're
not
really
here
anyway
does
this
mean
you're
not
going
away
