so
complicated
with
the
wedding
and
with
my
family
and
with
her

demons
and

what
if
it
all
goes
to
hell
aand
forever
but

i've
had
this
painful
hole
inside

i'm
the
idiot
that
dug
it
out
i
screwed
up
real
bad
spike

this
crap
from
you
i
forgot
willy
wannabite

take
care
of
her
and
when
you
say
poke

on
that's
ridiculous
what
you
think
this
isn't
real
just
because
of
all
the
vampires
and
demons
and
exvengeance
demons
and
the
sister
that
used
to
be
a
big
ball
of
universedestroying
energy
spike
we
need
muscle
not
color
commentary
okay
one
more
syllable
about
anya
the
demon
leaps
out
at
them
growling
xander
yelps
we
see
that
xander
is
also
holding
a
rifle
'cause
i
can't
say
glar
the
demon
attacks
it
knocks
xander
to
the
ground
and
kicks
at
spike
who
ducks
spike
punches
the
demon
a
few
times
and
then
kicks
it
back
xander
gets
up
holding
the
rifle
he
fires
a
dart
which
sticks
in
the
demon's
chest
the
demon
blocks
a
punch
from
spike
hits
him
and
kicks
him
spike
spins
around
and
falls
down
i
altered
his
reality
get
it
i
never
mind
hold
it
hold
it
yeah
i'd
like
both
my
arms
too
thanks

help
when
the

blistering
pain
subsides
make
sure
