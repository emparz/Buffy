back
when

got
so
scared
i
told
my
parents

they
completely
freaked
out
they
thought

was
something
seriously
wrong
with
me
so
they
sent
me
to
a
clinic
i
was
only
there
a
couple
of
weeks
i
stopped
talking
about
it
and
they
let
me
go
eventually

my
parents
just

forgot

if
i'm
still
there
what
if
i
never
left
that
clinic
alone
