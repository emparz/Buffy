the
other
hand

might
explain
some
things

this
all
being
in
that
twisted
brain
of
hers

thinks
up
some
chip
in
my
head
make
me
soft
fall
in
love
with
her

turn
me
into
her
soddin'
sex
slave

alternative
realities
where
we're
all
little
figments
of
buffy's
funnyfarm
delusion
you
know
in
a
different
reality
you
might
not
have
left
your
bride
at
the
altar
you
might
have
gone
through
with
it
like
a
man

antidote's
gonna
rid
you
of
that
nasty
martyrdom
see
i
figured
it
out
luv
you
can't
help
yourself
you're
not
drawn
to
the
dark
like
i
thought
you're
addicted
to
the
misery
it's
why
you
won't
tell
your
pals
about
us
might
actually
have
to
be
happy
if
you
did
they'd
either
understand
and
help
you
god
forbid

or
drive
you
out

where
you
can
finally
be
at
peace
in
the
dark
with
me
either
way
you'd
be
better
off
for
it
but
you're
too
twisted
for
that
let
yourself
live
already
and
stop
with
the
bloody
hero
trip
for
a
sec
we'd
all
be
the
better
for
it
you
either
tell
your
friends
about
us

or
i
will
