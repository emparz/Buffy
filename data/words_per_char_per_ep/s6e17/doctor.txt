do
you
know
where
you
are
buffy
no
none
of
that's
real
none
of
it
you're
in
a
mental
institution
you've
been
with
us
now
for
six
years
do
you
remember
it's
okay
buffy
buffy
it's
okay
look
look
who's
here
she's
lucid
keep
talking
maybe
the
sound
of
your
voice
will
ground
her
possibilities
for
a
full
recovery
but
we
have
to
proceed
cautiously
if
we're
not
careful
joyce
wait
mrs
summers
you
have
to
understand
the
severity
of
what's
happened
to
your
daughter
for
the
last
six
years
she's
been
in
an
undifferentiated
type
of
schizophrenia
buffy's
delusions
are
multilayered
she
believes
she's
some
type
of
hero
the
slayer
right
but
that's
only
one
level
she's
also
created
an
intricate
latticework
to
support
her
primary
delusion
in
her
mind
she's
the
central
figure
in
a
fantastic
world
beyond
imagination
she's
surrounded
herself
with
friends
most
with
their
own
superpowers

who
are
as
real
to
her
as
you
or
me
more
so
unfortunately
together
they
face

grand
overblown
conflicts
against
an
assortment
of
monsters
both
imaginary
and
rooted
in
actual
myth
every
time
we
think
we're
getting
through
to
her
more
fanciful
enemies
magically
appear
buffy
how
did
i
miss
doctor
and
she's
buffy
warren
and
jonathan
they
did
this
to
me
buffy
it's
all
right
they
can't
hurt
you
here
you're
with
your
family
a
magical
key
buffy
inserted
dawn
into
her
delusion
actually
rewriting
the
entire
history
of
it
to
accommodate
a
need
for
a
familial
bond
buffy
but
that
created
inconsistencies
didn't
it
your
sister
your
friends
all
of
those
people
you
created
in
sunnydale
they
aren't
as
comforting
as
they
once
were
are
they
they're
coming
apart
buffy
you
used
to
create
these
grand
villains
to
battle
against
and
now
what
is
it
just
ordinary
students
you
went
to
high
school
with
no
gods
or
monsters

just
three
pathetic
little
men

who
like
playing
with
toys
it's
not
gonna
be
easy
buffy
you
have
to
take
it
one
step
at
a
time
you
have
to
start
ridding
your
mind
of
those
things
that
support
your
hallucinations
you
understand
there
are
things
in
that
world
that
you
cling
to
for
your
delusion
they're
safeholds
but
for
your
mind
they're
traps
we
have
to
break
those
down
yes

but
i'm
talking
about
those
things
you
want
there
what
keeps
you
going
back
that's
right
last
summer
when
you
had
a
momentary
awakening
it
was
them
that
pulled
you
back
in
you
have
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
convince
yourself
of
that
buffy
whatever
it
takes
make
it
as
easy
on
yourself
as
possible
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that
i'm
sorry
there's
no
reaction
at
all
i'm
afraid
we
lost
her
