andrew
grins
and

he
turns
and
picks
up
a
very
long
wooden
tube
about
three
inches
in
diameter
painted
with
various
abstract
designs
he
sits
back
in
his
chair
puts
his

to
one
end
of
the

and
blows
it
makes
a
low
sound
like
a
flugelhorn
buffy
walks
into
the
alley
looking
from
her
piece
of
paper
to
the
house
and
back
something
drops
from
the
roof
of
the
nerds'
house
and
lands
behind
buffy
she
turns
to
look
at
it
it's
an
ugly
demon
with
waxy
skin
and
weird
marblelike
eyes
it
growls
and
advances
the

takes
a
swing
at

and

again
and
then
tries
a

kick
which

ducks
underneath
she
blocks
a
punch
and
punches
it
in
the
stomach

head
goes
through

car
window
breaking
it
close

on
the
demon's
hand
pressed
against
the
car
door
a
long
thin
bony

suddenly
shoots
out
of
its
