they
all
run
toward
the
bank
of
computers
along
one
wall
cut
back
to
magic
box
kissing
continues
as
anya
climbs
onto
spike's
lap
straddling
him
he
pushes
his
hands
up
underneath
her
shirt
and
pushes
the
shirt
up
revealing
a
black
bra
cut
back
to
the
lair
the
geeks
still
racing
for
the
computers
jonathan
still
holds
the
fire
extinguisher
cut
back
to
magic
box
spike
sweeps
a
pile
of
stuff
including
the
empty
liquor
bottle
off
the
table
with
one
arm
then
retreats
out
of
shot
so
all
we
see
is
the
bare
table
then
spike's
hands
place
anya
on
the
table
now
wearing
just
her
black
bra
and
short
red
skirt
she
lies
back
on
the
table
panting
then
spike
moves
on
top
of
her
between
her
legs
they
resume
kissing
she
continues
typing
and
looking
at
the
screen
she
stands
up
quickly
staring
at
the
screen
warren
os
shot
of
the
monitors
with
various
windows
flashing
chaotically
across
the
screens
jonathan
reaching
across
warren
to
andrew's
keyboard
they
all
freeze
staring
at
one
monitor
close
on
the
monitor
showing
a
fullcolor
view
of
spike
and
anya
having
sex
on
the
table
in
the
magic
box
the
geeks
stare
dropping
their
hands
from
the
keyboards
we
get
another
shot
of
the
screen
as
the
action
heats
up
the
kissing
becomes
more
frantic
andrew
riveted
andrew
glances
at
the
others
selfconsciously
warren
shaking
his
head
they
all
continue
to
watch
intently
xander
looks
buffy
stares
at
the
screen
looks
over
at
xander
back
to
the
screen
close
on
the
screen
it's
monochrome
unlike
the
geeks'
setup
but
the
image
of
spike
and
anya
kissing
and
writhing
on
the
table
is
quite
clear
shot
of
buffy
and
xander
both
watching
in
horror
sound
of
a
door
opening

through
the

looks
at
the

quickly
puts
her
hand
over
dawn's
eyes

looks
at

with
concern
then
at
