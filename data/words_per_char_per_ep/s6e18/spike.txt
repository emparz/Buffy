how
you
doin'
here
i
could
take
care
of
this
guy
if
you
want
i
mean
sure
he
don't
look
like
much
but
i'd
wager
he
could
give
you
a
bit
o'
nasty
save
you
the
staking
all
you
gotta
do
is
buffy
i
am
not
telling
my
friends
about
us
right
i'll
just
be
dropping
him
down
to
you
then
in
that
case
why
won't
you
sleep
with
me
again
like
hell
what's
this
yeah
i
got
that
part
why
am
i
holding
it
oh
the
great
xander
thinks
so
shudder
gasp
it
must
be
true
you
believe
him
don't
you
you
think
i
was
spying
on
you
you
think
i
could
do
that
i
don't
hurt
you
no
you
don't
i've
tried
to
make
it
clear
to
you
but
you
won't
see
it
something
happened
to
me
the
way
i
feel

about
you

it's
different
and
no
matter
how
hard
you
try
to
convince
yourself
it
isn't
it's
real
hey
i
need
a
thing
fresh
of
out
of
pleasure
that's
why
i'm
here
i
need
something
numbing
spell
maybe
sorry
to
bust
up
the
little
girls'
night
out
right
then
got
something
that'll
dull
the
ache
a
bit
so
then
this
girl
says
real
for
you
anya
right
but
getting
back
to
xander
xander
let's
not
waste
any
more
breath
on
that
wanker
i
care
what
he
done
to
you
i've
never
stooped
that
low
and
i'm
an
'evil
soulless
thing'
according
to
some
people
absolutely
take
him
on
myself
if
it
wasn't
for
my
little
handicap
you
name
it
pet
you're
the
wronged
party
something
uh
gruesome
how
'bout
right
and
i
didn't
ask
for
this
bloody
chip
in
my
head
me
too
the
using
part
i
just
wanted
to
know
what
i
was
missing
move
on
she
was
so
raw
i've
never
felt
anything
like
it
right
exactly
i

have
no
dance
to
the
rafters
never
i
was
always
going
above
and
beyond
i
saved
the
scoobies
how
many
times
and
i
can't
stand
the
lot
of
you
you
do
that's
why
you're
the
only
one
of
them
i
wouldn't
bite
if
i
had
the
chance
absolutely
i
have
nothing
but
respect
for
a
woman
who
is
forthright
drusilla
was
always
straightforward
didn't
have
a
single
buggering
clue
about
what
was
going
on
in
front
of
her
but
she
was
straight
about
it
that's
a
virtue
that's
because
he's
one
of
them
uptight
repressed
please
it's
no
wonder
they
couldn't
deal
with
the
likes
of
you
and
me
luv
we
should
have
been
dead
hundreds
of
years
ago

and
we're
the
only
ones
who
are
really
alive
here
ladies
last
take
it
quick
or
my
chivalry'll
run
out
intimately
yeah
shh
now
now
he
would
have
to
be
more
than
just
the
git
he
is
anya
he'd
have
to
be
deaf
dumb
and
blind
not
to
want
a
woman
like
you
the
two
of
them

they're
weak
is
all
but
i'll
tell
you
what
though
they'll
uh
miss
the
water
now
that
the
well's
gone
dry
too
hot
hmm
i'll
show
you
mine
moving
on
see
forthright
i'm
not
gonna
fight
you
chip
it's
good
enough
for
buffy
bloody
xander
muckin
up
everything
you
know
i
wish
anya
don't
