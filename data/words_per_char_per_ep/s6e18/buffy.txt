oh
fine
you
know
same
old
same
old
whatever
your
call
i
am
not
telling
my
friends
about
us
you
wanna
tell
them
so
badly
go
ahead
you
know
why
i
tried
to
kill
my
friends
my
sister
last
week

and
guess
how
much
they
hate
me
zero
zero
much
so
i'm
thinking
sleeping
with
you
they'll
deal
because
i
don't
love
you
okay
how
about
this
store
you
stole
a
toothbrush
yeah
but
you
stole
a
toothbrush
as
far
as
rebellious
teenagers
go
you're
kinda
square
guess
this
was
kind
of
a
lame
sisters'
day
out
huh
i
make
up
for
trying
to
kill
you
by
taking
you
to
places
you
can't
go
in
hey
how
about
the
pet
store
you
didn't
take
anything
from
there
did
you
okay
good
we
can
go
and
we
can
look
at
all
the
puppies
yeah
but
puppies
cute
come
on
you
used
to
love
the
pet
store
it'll
pass
you've
returned
all
the
stuff
that
you
still
had
and
we're
paying
for
the
rest
we'll
figure
it
out
nope
got
up
early
and
it
felt
like
a
breakfast
kind
of
morning
okay
what
kind
of
syrup
do
you
want
on
your
pancakes
oh
also
you
know
i
was
thinking
after
the
mall
yesterday
maybe
we
we
shouldn't
go
out
tonight
you
know
maybe
we
could
stay
in
and
uh
ow

um
you
know
get
a
pizza
or
uh
rent
a
movie
also
i
didn't
know
if
you
know
if
you
had
plans
this
weekend
but
i
thought
maybe
we
could
this
isn't
guilt
i
want
us
to
spend
time
but
i'm
cramping
your
teenage
style
yes
i
am
i'm
the
embarrassing
mom
who
tries
too
hard
when
did
this
happen
oh
and
then
maybe
we
can
invite
over
some
strangers
and
ask
them
to
feed
you
candy
true

but
technically
you're
oneandahalf
see
i
thought
a
little
levity
might

but
okay
also
no
i'm
sure
you
could
but
it's
a
little
more
dangerous
than
i
had
in
mind
dawn
i
work
very
hard
to
keep
you
away
from
that
stuff
okay
i
don't
want
you
around
dangerous
things
that
can
kill
you
but
you
don't
need
to
go
looking
for
them
now
eat
up
you're
gonna
be
late
for
school
i
don't
think
he
could
feel
any
worse
anya
xander's
my
friend
i
know
what
he
did
was
wrong
and

if
it
had
happened
to
me
i'd
i
don't
really
think
i
should
no
look
i

i
know
what
he
did
was
wrong
god
if
it
happened
to
me
i

ii
it
must
have
been
torture
whoa
guys
there
have
only
been
four

three
three
three
guys
that's
barely
plural
anya
i
know
you're
hurting
but
no
that's
not
what
i'm
saying
at
all
what
he
did
was
wrong
he
knows
that
he
really
did
look
ii
wish
that
okay
not
not
crazy
about
that
idea
or
in
the
land
of
the
sane
you
could
give
her
some
space
let
her
cool
down
true
uh
but
at
least
crap
guy
gets
to
keep
all
of
his
appendages
okay
see
that's
exactly
why
a
hearttoheart
is
probably
not
your
best
course
of
action
right
now
when
you're
both
angry
and
upset
and

what
the
hell
is
that
creepy
little
thing
doing
in
my
yard
did
willow
put
that
there
when
i
was
dead
'cause
if
i
had
known
i
would
have
crawled
out
of
the
grave
sooner
to
oh
my
god
what
the
who
it's
a
camera
someone
was
using
it
to
spy
on
me
on
my
house
xander
thinks
it's
you
spike
because
you
don't
lie
or
cheat
or
steal
or
manipulate
i
know
i
think
it
is
for
you
i
know
that's
not
what
you
want
to
hear
i'm
sorry
i
really
am
but
spike
you
have
to
move
on
you
have
to
get
over
how's
it
coming
can
you
see
who's
getting
the
camera's
signal
i
want
to
find
these
guys
talk
to
me
will
but
can
you
get
us
a
location
what
what
that's
enough
and
a
lot
of
monsters
but
it's
over
spike
i
kinda
didn't
wanna
admit
it
to
myself
didn't
take
long
did
it
xander
