too
hard
when

it's
just

what

could
hang
out
with
you
why

i
come
patrolling
with
you
tonight

guys
went
out
patrolling
every
night
when
you
were
my
age

just

i
just
think
i
could
help
but
buffy
dawn
i
work
very
hard
to
keep
you
away
from
that
stuff
okay
i
don't
want
you
around
dangerous
things
that
can
kill
you
which
would
be
a
perfectly
reasonable
argument
if
my
sister
was
chosen
to
protect
the
world
from
tax
audits
but
see
my
sister
is
you
and

dangerous
things
that
want
to
kill
me
seem
to
find
me
he
feels
awful
no
but
anya
what
if
it
were
you
dawn
what
if

all
you
dreamed
about
was
that
magical
day
the
day
when
the
one
person
you
loved
with
all
your
soul
would
promise
to
cherish
and
protect
your
heart
for
the
rest
of
his
life
but
instead
he
shatters
it
into
a
million
jagged
pieces
i
never
use
that
word
anymore
wish
i
didn't
say
that
no
i
didn't
i
swear
i
didn't
say
that
um

i
just
saw
you
were
back
and
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
working
off
my
debt
you
know
my
whole
stickyfingers
grabbyhands
thing
hey
guys
what's
up
so
this
is
it
this
is
the
stuff
you've
been
protecting
me
from
you
and
spike
uhhuh
i
wish
you'd
told
me
i
get
that
i
know
it
must
hurt
to
feel
like
you
have
to
hide
to
keep
secrets
from
everybody
