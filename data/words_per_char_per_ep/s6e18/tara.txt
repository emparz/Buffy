the
whole
basement
deal
and
buffy's

enjoying
the
refreshing
sanity
and

is
becoming
kind
of
a
regular
thing

and
me
after
class

this
time
you
stuck
around
she
was
just
a
friend
you
rushed
off
before
i
could
you
know
explain
unofficially

was
after
the
invisible
ray
okay
i'm
gone
for
a
couple
of
months
willow
oh
did
i
tell
you
about
the
demon
eggs
see
now
now
i
know
you're
just
trying
to
make
me
jealous
mm
it's
not
the
same
it's
not
like
living
with
a
house
full
of
family
or
sharing
a
room
with
someone
you
we've
been
so
worried
no
no
no
we
we
totally
understand
well
it's
it's
not
really
so
much
about
hating
the
men
well
ii
guess
it's

natural
for
guys
to
be
interested
in
anya
god
what
kind
of
lesbians
are
you
if
you
love
men
so
much
go
love
men
things
fall
apart
they
fall
apart
so
hard
you
can't
ever

put
them
back
the
way
they
were
i'm
sorry
it's
just

you
know
it
takes
time
you
can't
just

have
coffee
and
expect
willow
i
know
there's
just
so
much
to
work
through
trust
has
to
be
built
again
on
both
sides

you
have
to
learn
if

if
we're
even
the
same
people
we
were
if
you
can
fit
in
each
other's
lives
it's
a
long
important
process
and

can
we
just
skip
it
cancan
you
just
be
kissing
me
now
