we
have
one
more
award
to
give
out
is
buffy
summers
here
tonight
did
she
um
this
is
actually
a
new
category
first
time
ever
i
guess
there
were
a
lot
of
writein
ballots
and
um
the
prom
committee
asked
me
to
read
this
we're
not
good
friends
most
of
us
never
found
the
time
to
get
to
know
you
but
that
doesn't
mean
we
haven't
noticed
you
we
don't
talk
about
it
much
but
it's
no
secret
that
sunnydale
high
isn't
really
like
other
high
schools
a
lot
of
weird
stuff
happens
here
crowd
outbursts
zombies
hyena
people
snyder
but
whenever
there
was
a
problem
or
something
creepy
happened
you
seemed
to
show
up
and
stop
it
most
of
the
people
here
have
been
saved
by
you
or
helped
by
you
at
one
time
or
another
we're
proud
to
say
that
the
class
of
'99
has
the
lowest
mortality
rate
of
any
graduating
class
in
sunnydale
history
and
we
know
at
least
part
of
that
is
because
of
you
so
the
senior
class
offers
its
thanks
and
gives
you
uh
this
jonathan
produces
a
multicolored
glittering
miniature
umbrella
with
a
small
metal
plaque
attached
to
the
shaft
it's
from
all
of
us
and
it
has
written
here
buffy
summers
class
protector
the
crowd
breaks
into
sustained
applause
and
cheering
buffy
walks
to
the
stage
and
takes
her
award
