xander
no
i
will
though
it's
just
a
matter
of
time
that's
right
the
power
of
the
wish
made
me
a
righteous
sword
to
smite
the
unfaithful
you
know
you
can
laugh
but
i
have
witnessed
a
millennium
of
treachery
and
oppression
from
the
males
of
the
species
and
i
have
nothing
but
contempt
for
the
whole
libidinous
lot
of
them
i
don't
have
a
date
for
the
prom
men
are
evil
will
you
go
with
me
you
know
this
happens
to
be
all
your
fault
you
were
unfaithful
to
cordelia
so
i
took
on
the
guise
of
a
twelfthgrader
to
tempt
her
with
the
wish
when
i
lost
my
powers
i
got
stuck
in
this
persona
and
now
i
have
all
these
feelings
i
don't
understand
it
i
don't
like
it
all
i
know
is
i
really
want
to
go
to
this
dance
and
i
want
someone
to
go
with
me
you're
not
quite
as
obnoxious
as
most
of
the
alpha
males
around
here
plus
i
know
you
don't
have
a
date
fine
look
i
know
you
find
me
attractive
i've
seen
you
looking
at
my
breasts
whatever
look
do
you
wanna
go
with
me
or
not
so
she
wished
her
husband's
head
would
explode
which
was
great
except
we
were
standing
three
feet
from
him
at
the
time
what
a
mess
of
course
you
know
during
the
plague
it
was
always
parts
falling
off
well
that
got
old
since
pretty
much
they
were
anyway
the
renaissance
that
was

so
then
this
one
time
this
girl
wished
her
ex
would
cannibalize
himself
even
i
had
a
hard
time
watching
that
let
me
tell
you
this
isn't
bad
