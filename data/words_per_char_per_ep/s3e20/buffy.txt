what
do
i
have
funny
bed
hair
or
something
i
guess
we
got
a
little
carried
away
with
the
whole
postslayage
nap
thing
ohhh
not
good
to
go
kill
a
cat
on
my
head
you
know
this
place
really
isn't
girlfriendly
no
mirrors
no
natural
light
oh
yeah
i
really
like
okay
maybe
we
should
think
about
getting
a
few
mirrors
and
maybe
a
drawer
you
know
for
some
of
my
stuff
because
that's
what
couples
do
they
have
drawers
you
know
ii
figure
that
way
sometimes
i
could
spend
the
night
like
after
the
prom
it
would
be
nice
to
be
able
to
just
come
back
here
and
spend
some
time
together
end
of
high
school
rite
of
passage
thingy
think
cotillion
with
spiked
punch
and
electric
slide
oh
don't
worry
it's
at
night
and
lots
of
girls
have
older
girlfriends
you'll
blend
noo
must
be
a
few
more
hours
before
sunrise
ooh
sorry
i
guess
it's
later
than
we
thought
well
at
least
we
all
have
someone
to
go
with
now
some
of
us
are
going
with
demons
but
i
think
that's
a
valid
lifestyle
choice
more
importantly
i
have
the
kick
dress
angel's
gonna
lose
it
but
not
his
soul
he's
gonna
lose
it
his
it
so
it
was
blue
and
sorta
short
a
prom
dress
that
will
was
thinking
of
getting
can't
you
ever
get
your
mind
out
of
the
hellmouth
we'll
get
you
a
dress
you
know
we
should
check
april
fools
giles
we
get
it
miles
to
go
before
we
sleep
but
especially
if
we're
all
gonna
vaporize
or
something
on
graduation
day
we
deserve
a
little
prommy
fun
one
night
of
glory
not
to
much
to
ask
angel
i
always
say
patrol's
not
complete
without
a
trip
to
the
stinky
sewers
couldn't
we
just
let
this
be
the
vamp
that
got
away
we
could
say
he
was
this
big
you
need
clothes
you
don't
have
a
tux
do
you
for
the
prom
silly
sorry
giles
i'll
just
be
quiet
not
now
i'm
not
being
that
way
every
time
i
say
the
word
'prom'
you
get
grouchy
what
whole
thing
isn't
this
the
stuff
that
i'm
supposed
to
get
invested
in
going
to
a
formal
graduating
growing
up

the
dire
no

have
'something'

have
something
to
say

cryptic
you're
scaring
me

this
about
what
the
mayor
said
because
he
was
just
trying
to
shake
us
up
no
no
he
wasn't
he's
the
bad
guy
i
don't
care
about
that
children

say
jumping
the
gun
