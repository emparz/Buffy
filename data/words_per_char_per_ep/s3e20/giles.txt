be
delighted
to
however
the
day
of
the
mayor's
ascension
is
fast
approaching
and
we
don't
know
what
to
expect
on
the
contrary
no
we
uh
we
know
the
ascension
refers
to
a
human
transforming
into
a
demon
the
living
embodiment
of
an
immortal
and
graduation
day
our
mayor
wilkins
is
scheduled
to
do
just

are
thousands
of
species

be
wearing
pink
taffeta
as
chenille

not
go
with
my
complexion
can
we
please
talk
about
the
ascension
yes
it's
particularly
vicious
it's
sort
of
a
demon
foot
soldier
bred
during
the
machash
wars
trained
solely
to
kill
they
feed
off
the
brains
of
their
foes
so
we
have
a
threat
against
the
students
on
their
big
night
a
hellhound
trained
to
attack
people
in
formal
wear
tucker
is
planning
to
attack
the
prom
tonight
um
i
suppose
buffy
they're
right
you
need
i
don't
have
to
tell
you
that
you're
being
rather
rash
finding
an
address
hardly
adds
up
to
case
closed
angel's
not
taking
you
is
he
oh
buffy
i'm
sorry
i
don't
really
know
what
to
say
um
i
understand
that
this
sort
of
thing
requires
ice
cream
of
some
kind
you
sure
oh
yes
at
an
allmale
preparatory
they
didn't
go
in
for
this
sort
of
thing
for
god's
sake
man
she's
eighteen
and
you
have
the
emotional
maturity
of
a
blueberry
scone
just
have
at
it
would
you
and
stop
fluttering
about
you
did
good
work
tonight
buffy
i
had
no
idea
that
children
en
masse
could
be
gracious
every
now
and
then
giles
takes
her
umbrella
and
leaves
buffy
turns
to
see
angel
at
the
door
they
meet
