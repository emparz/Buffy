look
i
know
mom
wants
to
gather
and
make
with
the
merry
tomorrow
night
but
with
everything
that's
going
on
i
just
don't
think
this
is
the
best
time
to
break
out
the
party
pinata
we
need
to
stay
focused
if
we're
gonna
find
a
way
to
stop
glory
she's
right
i've
thrown
everything
i've
got
at
her
and
she
just
shrugs
it
off
i
guess
glory
found
one
the
question
is
why
okay
so
we
know
where
glory's
from
what
do
we
know
about
her
you
know
she's
tough
yeah
but
but
no
bolts
of
lightning
no
blasts
of
fire
shouldn't
a
god
be
able
to
do
that
kind
of
stuff
crazy
people
we
have
to
find
a
way
to
stop
her
i
don't
think
that's
what
we
should
be
worrying
about
right
now
we
did
giles
and
me
we
we
know
where
it
is
look
iif
glory
knew
that
you
guys
knew
where
it
was
i

ii
just
didn't
wanna
put
you
in
that
kind
of
danger
will
there
you're
right
it's
time
if
they're
gonna
be
risking
their
lives
they
deserve
to
know
there's
something
that
you
need
to
know

about
dawn
you
always
think
harder
is
better
maybe
next
time
i
patrol
i
should
carry
a
load
of
bricks
use
a
stake
made
of
butter
that
true
how
was
school
today
just
how
i
remember
it
so
what's
the
homework
sitch
maybe
later
i
have
some
stuff
i
have
to
do
first
glory
and
no
it's
not
right
a
young
delicate
pain
in
my
butt
glory
is
evil
and
powerful
and
in
no
way
prettier
than
me
you
are
very
very
wise
now
gimme
gimme
gimme
ohh

it's
beautiful
thank
you
guys
it's
not
gonna
explode
is
it
i
remember
thank
you
no
dawn
what
are
you
doing
in
there
party
gettin'
slow
you
know
what
let's
not
have
this
exchange
of
images
right
now
i
wasn't
really
expecting
one
no
contact
with
civilians
there's
probably
a

code
name
for
it
you
know
like
radio
silence
it's
'greeting
card
silence'
maybe
it's
time
to
start
a
new
tradition
birthdays
without
boyfriends
it
could
be
just
as
much
fun
dawn
what
did
you
do
thanks
this
is
a
family
thing
we
should
deal
with
this
we
were
going
to
it
just
six
months
ago
dawn

mom
and
i
know
what
we
feel
i
know
i
care
about
you
i
know
that
i
worry
about
you
i
worry
because
my
sister
is
cutting
herself
dawn
we
need
answers
giles
we
need
to
find
out
everything
we
can
about
the
key
what's
it
for
who
created
it
this
isn't
about
her
it's
about
dawn
she
deserves
to
know
where
she
came
from
she
needs
to
know
or
it's
just
gonna
eat
away
at
her
how
could
you
let
her
find
out
like
that
from
books
and
papers
you
hate
me
that
much
you
could
have
stopped
her
she
shouldn't
have
found
out
like
that
she
needs
time
we
can't
force
her
to
be
all
right
with
this
no
but
if
i
were
her
i'd
want
a
little
bit
of
time
right
now
i
wouldn't
want
my
mother
and
my
sister
coming
at
me
from
all
sides
she
probably
feels
like
she
can
say
or
do
anything
right
now
she's
not
real
we're
not
her
family
we
don't
even
know
what
she
is
i'm
not
i'm
just

saying
that's
probably
how
she
feels
it's
not
that
simple
we're
not
gonna
be
able
to
fix
this
with
a
hug
and
a
kiss
and
a
bowl
of
soup
dawn
needs
to
know
where
she
came
from
she
needs
real
answers
the
slayer
is
the
only
thing
standing
between
dawn

and
this
god
from
the
bitch
dimension
that
wants
to
shove
her
in
some
kind
of
lock
and
give
her
a
good
twirl
mom
i
need
to
be
out
there
doing
my
job
oh
my
god
glory

willow's
spell

could
have
burned
the
house
down

tore
up
her
room

burned
all
of
her
diaries
since
