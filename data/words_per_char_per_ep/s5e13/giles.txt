that
might
pose
some
difficulty
from
what
the
council's
been
able
to
discover
from
the
book
of
tarnis
and
and
and
other
sources
glory
and
two
of
her
fellow
hellgods
ruled
over

one
of
the
more
seriously
unpleasant
demon
dimensions
all
pushing
on
the
edges
of
our
reality
trying
to
find
a
way
in
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
here
just

vague
references
to

chaos
and
destruction
uh
usually
yes
but
um
being
in
human
form
must
be
severely
limiting
her
powers
all
we
have
to
worry
about
right
now
is
she's
immortal
invulnerable
and
insane
from
what
i've
been
able
to
gather
her
living
in
this
world
is

seriously
affecting
her
mental
state
as
well
she's
only
being
able
to
keep
her
mind
intact
by
uh
extracting
energy
from
us
well
from
from
the
human
brain
she
um

'absorbs
the
energies
that
bind
the
human
mind
into
a
cohesive
whole'
once
drained
all
that's
left
behind
is
uh
which
is
i'm
afraid
why
there's
been
a
marked
increase
in
the
ranks
of
the
mentally
unstable
here
in
sunnydale
there
were

reasons
are
you
sure
i'm
not
sure
our
regular
workout
is

challenging
you
any
more
perhaps
we
should
make
it
harder
very
amusing
i'm
sure
dawn
feels
that
way
about
her
schoolwork
sometimes
i'm
fairly
certain
i
wasn't
i've
got
one
just
like
it
well
now
wait
just
a
second
i
assume
you're
talking
about
her
existence
rather
than
her
intentions
perhaps
i
should
stay
you
know
just
in
case
okay
how
did
she
find
these
how
did
she
get
in
here
well
it
takes
some
getting
used
to
the
idea
of
a

bright
fourteenyearold
actually
being
living
energy
thousands
of
years
old
people
have
killed
died
for
it

summoned
armies
to
control
the
key
your
point
being
that
was
an
incredibly

dangerous
spell
for
an
adept
at
your
level
