i
wasn't
lurking
i
was
standing
about
it's
a
whole
different
vibe
shouldn't
you
be
tucked
away
in
your
beddybye
all
warm
and
safe
where
nothing
can
eat
you
little
tremble
wouldn't
hurt
are
not
magic
shop
eh
all
number
of
beasties
between
here
and
there
bet
they'd
really
go
for
a
little
red
riding
hood
like
you
bet
that
wouldn't
sit
too
well
with
big
sister
yeah
all
right
give
us
a
sec
i
usually
just
burst
through
doors
that's
right
who's
bad
now
girl
with
a
mission
eh
what's
the
caper
jewels
ancient
artifacts
or
just
plain
hard
cash
liberated
from
the
till
all
this
for
a
book
where
did
he
learn
to
write
so
bloody
small
from
a
fruit
fly
didn't
go
with
my
stuff
anyway
mm
secondsight
blokes
mostly
or
even
just
your
runofthemill
lunatics
what
else
does
it
say
about
this
key
is
it
made
out
of
gold
maybe
we
can
hock
it
split
the
take
'the
monks
possessed
the
ability
to
transform
energy
bend
reality'
blah
blah
blah
good
lord
giles
writes
as
dull
as
he
talks
doesn't
he
'they
started
work
but
the
council

has
suggested

to
us
that
they
were
interrupted
presumably
by

glory'
'they
obviously
did
manage
to
accomplish
the
taste'
'accomplish
the
task
they
had
to
be
certain
the
slayer
would
protect
it
with
her
life
so
they
sent
the
key
to
her

in
human
form
in
the
form
of
a
sister'
zoom
in
on
dawn's
shocked
expression
huh
i
guess
that's
you
nibblet
morning
sunshine
if
you've
come
around
for
eggs
or
sausage
i'm
fresh
out
hey
careful
these
are
wet
i
was
just
along
for
the
ride
not
like
i
knew
she
was
mystical
glowy
key
thing
nobody
keeps
me
in
the
bloody
loop
do
they
oh
yeah
here
it
comes
something
goes
wrong
in
your
life
blame
spike
news
flash
blondie
if
kid
sis
wants
to
grab
a
midnight
stroll
she'll
find
a
way
sooner
or
later
i
just
thought
she'd
be
safer
with
big
bad
looking
over
her
shoulder
you
didn't
think
you
could
keep
the
truth
from
her
forever
did
you
maybe
if
you
had
been
more
honest
with
her
in
the
first
place
you
wouldn't
be
trying
to
make
yourself
feel
better
with
a
round
of
kick
the
spike
yeah
that
should
do
it
the
nibblet
scampered
off
to
get
away
from
you
she
hears
you
bellowing
she's
gonna
pack
it
in
the
opposite
direction
can't
say
i
blame
her
look
she
probably
would
have
skipped
off
anyway
even
if
she
never
found
out
she's
not
just
a
blob
of
energy
she's
also
a
fourteenyearold
hormone
bomb
which
one's
screwing
her
up
more
right
now
spin
the
bloody
wheel
you'll
find
her
just
in
the
nick
of
time
that's
what
you
hero
types
do
you'll
find
her
i
thought
you
said
this
skank
was
tough
