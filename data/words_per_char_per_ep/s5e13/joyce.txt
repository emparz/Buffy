it
still
seems
to
me
like
there's
a
lot
you
don't
know
about
this
i
mean
is
she
dangerous
exactly
oh
baby
oh
sweetie
no
whawhat
is
this
all
about
we
thought
it
would
be
better
if
we
waited
until
you
were
older
you're
fourteen
sweetheart
you
know
that
honey
you've
been
alive
a
lot
longer
than
that
to
us
sweetheart
dawn
get
out
honey
you're
gonna
be
late
for
school
you
want
me
to
make
you
some
soup
i
think
there's
some
chicken
and
stars
honey
calm
down
okay
we
can't
just
let
her
sit
up
there
all
alone
that's
your
answer
just

leave
her
alone
and
hope
that
everything
works
itself
out
her
school
called
today
she
was
suspended
she
yelled
at
a
teacher
the
things
she
said
buffy
i
mean
she
never
used
language
like
that
buffy
she
probably
feels
like
she
can
say
or
do
anything
right
now
she's
not
real
we're
not
her
family
we
don't
even
know
what
she
is
how
can
you
talk
about
dawn
as
if
she's
a
thing
well
then
we
have
to
show
her
that
it
isn't
true
she
needs
to
know
that
she's
still
a
part
of
this
family
and
that
we
love
her
what
she
needs
is
her
sister
buffy
not
the
slayer
wait
it's
not
glory
buffy
buffy

she's
gone
