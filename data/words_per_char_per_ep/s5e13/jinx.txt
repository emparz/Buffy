you
really
think
he
is
going
to
help
you
i
fear
your
faith
is
gravely
misplaced
yes
they've
arrived
unfortunate
but
not
completely
unexpected
their
numbers
are
few
for
the
moment
but
they
will
grow
the
knights
of
byzantium
are
like
ants
first
you
see
one
then
two
then
the
picnic's
ruined
no
matter
how
many
we
kill
they'll
keep
coming

wave
after
wave
it's
time
to
set
old
animosities
aside
your
fate
is
directly
linked
to
her
magnificentlyscented
glorificus
she's
been
extremely
forgiving
of
your
considerable
foibles
up
until
now
but
if
you
persist
in
your
defiance
she'll
be
forced
to
ben
to
what
what
is
she
going
to
do
send
a
sixpack
of
minions
to
bore
me
to
death
glory
can't
lay
a
finger
on
me
you
know
it
i
know
it
she
knows
it
so
save
the
threats
or
i'll
finish
the
job
i
started
on
your
head
