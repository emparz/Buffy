it's
about
power
who's
got
it
who
knows
how
to
use
it
so
who's
got
the
power
dawn
the
stake
is
not
the
power
who's
got
the
power
never
forget
it
doesn't
matter
how
well
prepped
you
are
or
how
well
armed
you
are
you're
a
little
girl
little
woman
he's
a
vampire
ok
demon
preternaturally
strong
skilled
with
powers
no
human
could
possibly
ever—
you're
stuck
zip
it
listen
up
i'm
the
slayer
you
don't
want
to
get
into
it
with
me
you
want
blood
you
can
have
hers
power
he's
got
it
he's
going
to
use
it
you
don't
have
it
so
—
—use
that
perfect
it's
real
it's
the
only
lesson
dawn
it's
always
real
let
me
see
really
you
wanted
to
be
trained
you
did
pretty
well
yeah
my
first
time
out
i
missed
the
heart
too
just
the
once
the
next
vampire
you
meet
you
run
away
i
just
wish
that
was
all
we
had
to
worry
about
vampires
demons
they're
nothing
compared
to
what's
coming
believe
me
i
thought
i
was
long
past
it
i
guess
you
never
are
just
a
few
more
days
'til
it
starts
then
we'll
never
know
what's
coming
next
dawn
xander's

going
to
be
late

the
box
near
the
milk

saw
it
on
the
food
channel
want
something

sister's
about
to
go
to
the
same
high
school
that

to
kill
me

three
years
i
can't
change
districts
i
can't
afford
private
school

i
can't
begin
to
prepare
for
what

possibly
come
out
of
there
so
peachy
with
a
side
of
keen
that
would
be
me

with
your
mouth
full
nothing
creepy
strange
from
beyond
under
the
library

really
think
she's
my
it's
my
hair

um
i

uh

in
danger
of
smoking
i'll
be
around
oh

great
if
you're
a
zombie
ghost
thing

like
old
times
i'm
not
sure
they
were
in
the
mirror
but
they
disappeared
um
but
they
touched
me
i
think
well
let's
just
start
with
dead
and
pissed
they
talked
about
protecting
people
told
me
to
leave
i
think
i
may
have
destroyed
dawn's
social
life
in
all
of
about
30
seconds
but
apart
from
that
no
this
isn't
a
coincidence
you
know
the
school
being
rebuilt
it
means
something
ooh
sorry
uh
yeah
i
was
just
looking
for—
well
it's
a
new
campus
i'm
just
getting
to
know
it
you
know
make
sure
it's
safe
for
my
sister
isn't
that
interesting
huh
more
like
a
plaid
kind
of
a
clan
tartan
of
badness
really
you
know
but
there
were
factors
no
she's
much
much
worse
than
me
troublemaker
expulsion
is
really
the
only
way
to
go
you
know
or
you
can
suspend
her
for
three
years
boy

loud
excuse
me

dog
uh
dog
walker
three
dead
