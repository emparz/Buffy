get
out
do
you
really
think
you
can
run
away
too
late
but
then
you're
always
too
late

you
sure
as
hell
didn't
save
me
i
think
she's
lost
she's
not
gonna
hear
you
this
place
is
like
a
maze
all
we
want
is
for
you
to
leave
so
we
can
rest
again
you
can
thank
your
sister
for
this

you
going
to
do
kill
us
