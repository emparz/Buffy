night

yeah
it
made
her
delusional
what
happened
wow
and
she
was
eight
buffy's
not
here
for
cosmetic
surgery
do
you
think
angel
will
attack
buffy
in
here
that's
true
not
to
be
outdone
it's
my
way
of
saying
'get
well
soon'
i
did
all
your
assignments
all
you
have
to
do
is
sign
your
name
do
you
want
me
to
go
real
fast
not
that
i
would
how
the
death
as
in
'it
is
your
time'
did
it
have
an
hourglass
your
mom
did
tell
us
about
your
cousin
so
where
do
we
start
i'm
sensing
a
little
less
than
full
committal
here
that's
true
but
on
the
'we
live
on
the
hellmouth'
side
these
kids
may
have
seen
a
monster
unless
so
the
kids
might
be
afraid
of
a
regular
person
let's
look
him
up
reprimands
for
controversial
experiments
risky
procedures
a
malpractice
suit
looks
like
it
was
dropped
suddenly
this
may
be
our
death
guy
so
we
checked
dr
backer
out
this
guy
was
not
a
solid
citizen
you
saw
it
she
doesn't
look
well
oh
yeah
i'm
good
at
medical
stuff
since
xander
and
i
used
to
play
doctor
all
the
time
wrong
why
how
did
you
play
doctor
it's
weird
going
through
his
things
hey
wait
i
think
i
have
something
okay
this
makes
sense
dr
backer
was
trying
to
inoculate
the
kids
with
a
controlled
dosage
of
the
same
virus
they
already
had
oh
raising
their
temperatures
to
burn
the
fever
out
of
them
according
to
this
it
was
starting
to
so
he
really
was
trying
to
help
the
kids
thanks
your
cousin
you
will
we
will
you
saw
it
once
buffy
think
about
this
it's
crazy
but
how
are
you
gonna
fight
this
thing
with
107
degree
temperature
buffy
buffy
that's
100
pure
it'll
kill
you
in
an
instant
it
needs
to
be
diluted
hang
in
there
you'll
be
okay
what
could
have
happened
what
i
uh
she's
not
feeling
well
again
she's
sorry
frogs
frogs
get
'em
off
of
me
oh
my
god

them
off
of
me
please
help
get
'em
off
frogs

god
