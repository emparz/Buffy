half
the
school's
out
with
this
flu
it's
a
serious
deal
buffy
we're
all
concerned
about
how
gross
you
look
she
fainted
what
does
that
mean
they
won't
let
us
in
there
i
think
she
wants
to
go
yuk
i
don't
know
lysette
got
her
nose
done
here
and
she
came
in
looking
for
the
gwyneth
paltrow
and
it
looked
more
like
the
mr
potatohead
no
but
while
she's
in
here
she
might
as
well
get
that
thing
done
you
know
that
thing
on
her
face
you
know
that
thing
am
i
the
only
one
that's
noticed
that
thing
nobody
told
me
i
was
supposed
to
bring
a
gift
i
was
out
of
the
loop
on
gifts
death
but
you
do
know
that
you
saw
death
so
this
isn't
about
you
being
afraid
of
hospitals
'cause
your
friend
died
and
you
wanna
conjure
up
a
monster
that
you
can
fight
so
you
can
save
everybody
and
not
feel
so
helpless
tact
is
just
not
saying
true
stuff
i'll
pass
you
had
to
ask
that
didn't
you
this
is
what
happens
when
you're
compassionate
towards
sick
people
they
take
advantage
of
you
i
didn't
wanna
be
the
first
one
to
say
it
right
stereotypes
are
so
unfair
oh
well
you
know
i
think
that
security
guards
are
way
sexier
than
firemen
they're
all
sooty
mm
how
thrilling
do
you
ever
get
scared
i
bet
you
see
a
lot
of
tragedy
you
know
like
that
little
girl
what's
that
uh
you
know
i
didn't
hear
anything
you
know
you
have
the
most
perfect
nose
i've
ever
seen
you
must
work
out
mmhm
jealous
what
about
you
oh
right
your
obsession
with
protecting
buffy
have
i
told
you
how
attractive
that's
not
yeah
well
i've
seen
you
watch
her
back
well
i
was
using
the
phrase
'watch
her
back'
as
a
euphemism
for
'looking
at
her
butt'
you
know
sort
of
a
pun
well
you
do
fine
watch
my
back
what
do
you
mean
'clean'
but
you
said
you
did
see
something
the
other
night
you
sure
didn't
he's
invisible
let's
go
tactguy
be
careful
eww
what
does
this
do
what
does
this
do
wow
what
does
this
one
do
ouch
wait
what
does
this
one
do
boy
there's
a
demon
for
everything
well
it's
not
in
here
it's
called
der
kindestod
it's
me
i've
got
your
monster
looking
up
stuff
hey
i
found
your
guy
okay
just
listen
the
name
means
'child
death'
this
book
says
that
he
feeds
off
of
children
by
sucking
the
life
out
of
them
eew
but
anyway
afterwards
it
looks
like
they
died
because
they
were
sick
yeah
that's
my
take
'cause
it
would
be
looking
at
the
children's
ward
as
basically
an
allyoucaneat
kind
of
thing
y'know
hence
the
sliceage
oh
eww
oh
uh
you
should
see
this
thing
the
way
it
does
its
thing
i
mean
eww
why
do
i
let
you
guys
drag
me
into
this
stuff
