eye
on

to
hold

eyes
bug
out
and

they
extend
from

make
contact
with

feels
his
energy
being
drained
suddenly
the
kindestod
gets
hit
in
the
head
with
a
large
section
of
pipe
and
its

snap
back
into

stands
over

pipe
held
ready
the
kindestod
stands
up
and

her

blocks
it
and
knocks
it
from

grip
although
xander
can't
see
it
he
sees
that

is
fighting
something
and
takes
the
opportunity
to
go
to

him
up
from

carries
the
boy
over
to
the

her
against
a
pipe

throwing
a
few
glances
over
at

along
the
way
she
swings
twice
at
the
monster

and
avoids
the
blows

get
hit
and
she
spins
around
and

out
a
grunt
of
pain
