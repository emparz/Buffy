around

carrying
a

quietly
speaks
her
spell

blows
out

has
very

of
horns
starting
just
above
its
eyes
and
continuing
up
on
its
high
thick
forehead

but
she's
ready
and
pulls
the
trigger
the
dart
flies
from
the
barrel
and
hits
him
in
the
side
and
he
yelps
and
falls
to
the
floor
it's
not
enough
to
keep
him
down
in
his
agitated
state
though
and
he
gets
back
up
on
all

behind
him
giles
scrambles
to

table
dragging
giles
down
on

shallowly
as

steps
up
to
him
and
soothingly
pets
the
thick
fur
on
his
head
willow
remorsefully
to
oz
he
checks
himself
in
the
rearview
mirror
and
thinks
about
what
just
happened
he
sighs
and
looks
into
the
back
seat
there
he
sees
the
two
bags
of
stolen
ingredients
and
grabs
one
to
see
what's
inside
in
it
he
finds
a
can
of
kerosene

short
length
of

when
they
realize
they
don't
have
time
for
this
jack
glances
over
at
the
exit
sign
above
a
door
xander
raises
his
eyebrows
jack
tries
to
psyche
xander
out
he's
proven
right
when
jack
makes
a
move
for
the
door
xander
matches
his
move
and
jack
realizes
there's
no
way
he
can
get
out
they
face
each
other
from
opposite
sides
of
the
bomb
xander
is
oddly
calm
whereas
jack
is
clearly
afraid
xander
glances
at
the
bomb
smiles
thinly
from
above
him
at
the
stack
level
she
starts
to
swing
at
the
creature
with
a
battleaxe

xander
stands
his

thoughts

xander
gives
jack
a
little
frown
saying
in
essence
'too
late
now'

jack
caves
and
quickly
reaches
in
and
pulls
a
wire
the
timer
goes
blank
he
drops
the
wires
and
pulls
his
hands
away
it
takes
xander
a
moment
to
realize
that
it's
over
he
steps
over
to
jack
and
looks
him
straight
in
the
eyes
he
goes
over
to
the
door
he
entered
from
gives
jack
one
last
look
opens
it
and
leaves
closing
it
behind
him
jack
walks
toward
the
other
door
he
pulls
the
door
open
and
werewolf
oz
jumps
out
at
him
jack
screams
as
he
hits
the
floor
and
gets
mauled
the
camera
pans
over
to
buffy
and
willow
buffy's
right
arm
is
in
a
sling
willow
shakes
her
head
buffy
to
giles
buffy
he
looks
up
at
her
giles
grins
he
turns
his
face
revealing
several
nasty
scratches
across
his
left
cheek
ear
and
neck
xander
finds
them
xander
shrugs
xander
grins
giles
quietly
he
goes
to
get
his
snack
but
runs
into
cordelia
who
is
eager
to
begin
the
game
again
he
just
smiles
at
her
if
only
she
knew
of
course
she
doesn't
have
a
clue
he
smiles
more
broadly
and
just
walks
past
her
cordelia
unnerved
xander
just
keeps
walking
away
never
looking
back
cordelia
insistently
