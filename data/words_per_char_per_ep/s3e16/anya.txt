was
robbed

for
a
thousand
years
i
wielded
the
powers
of
the
wish
i
brought
ruin
to
the
heads
of
unfaithful
men
i
brought
forth
destruction
and
chaos
for
the
pleasure
of
the
lower
beings
i
was
feared
and
worshipped
across
the
mortal
globe
and

stuck
at
sunnydale
high
mortal
child

flunking

a
family
heirloom
passed
down
for

endless
one
offer

temporal
fold

i
pour
the
sacred
sand
on
the
representation
of
the
necklace
and
eryishon
brings
it
forth
from
the
time
