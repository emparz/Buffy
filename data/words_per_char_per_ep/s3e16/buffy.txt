iit's
me
i'm
the
one
that

have
gone
out
and
gotten
attacked
which
she
never
would
have
done
if
i
hadn't
have
called
her
reliable
and
now
my
best
friend
is
willow
you're
alive
oh
you
are
ii
mean
you
you
were
giles
planning
on
jumping
in
with
an
explanation
any
time
soon
it
was
exactly
you
will
every
detail
except
for
your
not
being
a
dominatrix
as
far
as
we
know
oh
yeah
we
saw
her
too
at
the
bronze
we
can
figure
out
who
she
is
after
we
stop
the
feeding
frenzy
how
many
of
them
were
there
should
we
call
faith
i
don't
know
will
i
mean
we
just
have
to
stop
them
willow
just
remember
a
vampire's
personality
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
person
it
was
uh
i
have
a
really
bad
idea
are
you
okay
in
that
first
sign
of
trouble
you
give
us
a
signal
we
come
in
hard
and
fast
now
you're
sure
you're
up
to
this
we'll
be
right
outside
well
i
work
out
i'm
not
sure
about
releasing
this
thing
into
the
wild
will
it
is
a
demon
no
me
neither
there
but
for
the
grace
of
getting
bit
you
wanna
go
out
tonight
you
know
you
can
od
on
virtue
you
wanna
go
out
tonight
