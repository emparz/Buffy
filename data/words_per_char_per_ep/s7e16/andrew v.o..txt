it
was
cold
last
night
and
the
wind
was
crewell
but
the
slayer
had
a
job
to
do
unfortunately
vampires
have
a
job
to
do
too
you've
already
met
buffy

she's
beautiful
with
a
lion's
heart
and—

and
the
face
of
an
angel
she's
never
afraid
'cause
she
knows
her
side
will
always
win

buffy
and
spike
have
some
kind
of
history—you
can
feel
the
heat
between
them
although
technically
as
a
vampire
he's
room
temperature

anya
a
feisty
waif
with
a
firey
temper
and
a
vulnerable
heart
that
she
hides
even
from
herself

this
lovely
girl—i
don't
remember
her
name—
