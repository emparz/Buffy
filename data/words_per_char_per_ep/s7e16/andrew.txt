oh
hello

gentle
viewers
you

me
catching
up

old

it
adventure
and
heroics
and
discovery—don't
they
just
take
you
away
come
with
me
now

the
mind

little
tale
i
like
to
call
buffy
slayer
of
the
vampyrs
ouch
my
goodness
things
look
bad
for
the
slayer
don't
they
she
didn't
see
that
second
vampire
concealed
by
cover
of
darkness
ready—
ready
to
attack
and
make
her
his
own
vampirical
spawn
let's
rejoin
them
now
to
see—
entertaining
and
educating

you
dusting
that
guy
on
film
hey
why
do
vampires
show
up
on
video
ok
i'll
cut
the
footage
together
and
do
the
intro
tomorrow
she
was
a
woman
in
danger
or
was
she
but
it's
a
valuable
record
an
important
document
for
the
ages
a
slayer
in
action
but
the
story
needs
to
be
told
the
world's
gonna
want
to
know
about
buffy
it's
a
story
of
ultimate
triumph
tainted
with
the
bitterness
for
what's
been
lost
in
the
struggle
it's
a
legacy
for
future
generations
oh
i
was
gonna
interview
you
later
today
'cause
you
know
your
whole
perspective
on
the
whole
thing
give
it
editorial
balance
and
uh
glamour
let's
explore
the
world
of
our
story
shall
we
this—uh
buffy
lives
in
sunnydale
california
um
this
is
the
local
high
school
there's
a
hellmouth—hellmouth—underneath
the
high
school
see
weird
things
happen
on
the
hellmouth
that
attracts
all
sorts
of
uh
bad
people
and
demons
and
vampires
and
now
there's
this
thing
in
the
basement
of
the
high
school
called
thethe
seal
of
danzal—danzalthar
and
it's
sort
of
a
door
to
the
hellmouth
uh
due
to
some
circumstances
it
got
opened
up
a
little
bit
recentlyuh
and
this
uh
nasty
nasty
vampire
thing
came
out
of
it
it
was
uh
it
was
just
awful
awful
this
whole
thing—
whole
thing—is
being
orchestrated
by
something
called
the
first
it's
made
up
of
all
the
evil
in
the
whole
world
oh
there's
also
these
guys
they
work
for
the
first
we
don't
know
much
about
them
except
that
they're
very
ugly
and
they're
very
mobile
for
blind
people
is
that
all
clear
it's
morning
in
sunnydale—
it's
morning
in
sunnydale
and
the
women
of
command
central
take
the
time
to
fortify
themselves
for
the
day
ahead
women
and
xander
hey
i'm
gonna
do
your
special
intro
later
the
man
who
is
the
heart
of
the
slayer
machine
things
are
tense
in
command
central
this
morning
buffy
is
clearly
concerned
with
some
unknown
danger
and
the
air
is
filled
with
foreboding
that's
probably
not
the
unknown
danger
full
house
i
think
it's
a
good
time
to
do
some
introductions
don't
you
gentle
viewers
not
you
sweetheart
let's
start
from
the
top
honestly
gentle
viewers
these
motivating
speeches
of
hers
tend
to
get
a
little
long
i'll
take
you
back
in
there
in—in
a
little
while
but
in
the
inbetween
time
i
thought
you
might
want
to
know
a
little
about
me
your
humble
host
you
see
i
am
a
man
with
a
burden
a
man
with
a
dark
past
you
see
i
was
once
a
super
villain
thus
the
validity
of
the
bronsteddebyehuckel
equation
at
low
ionic
strength
has
been
amply
tested
and
the
charges
on
the
reactant
ions
are
wellknown
if
their
reagents
are
properly
characterized

know
kinda
sweaty
make
her
super
magnetic
we
could
walk
right
by
her
and
she
wouldn't
be
able
to
stop
us
in
my
plan
we
are
beltless
warren
was
cool
and
wasn't
jonathan
just
the
cutest
thing
well
shall
we
see
if
buffy's
still
talking
she's
not
done
even
willow
looks
bored
and
she
usually
can
take
a
lot
of
that
stuff
look
at
her
ooh
ooh
do
you
see
that
thatthat's
important
willow
and
kennedy
have
been
in
kind
of
a
bad
place
lately
but
things
are
looking
up
you
see
kennedy
pursued
the
reluctant
willow
and
won
her
heart
only
to
find
herself
frightened
when
she
glimpsed
the
darkness
that
still
lies
within
the
witch's
mind
side
note—i
once
had
my
own
personal
encounter
with
dark
willow
haltem
that's
because
we
have
power
you
can't
imagine
you
dark
willow
wield
a
force
of
mighty
evil
it's
true
but
you
are
new
to
the
game
little
one
i
deflect
thy
power
thank
you
little
one
thank
you
she
was
something
indeed
she
was
hey
i
think
buffy
stopped
talking
that
usually
means
she
had
to
go
to
work
let's
see
what
the
little
locusts
left
for
breakfast
shall
we
dawn
is
a
typical
american
teenager
bubbly
and
sweet
with
a
hunger
for
fun
and
a
smile
that
lights
up
the
room
dawn
used
to
be
a
key
i
don't
really
know
what
that
means
hey
here's
something
i
think
you're
going
to
be
interested
in
gentle
viewers
look
at
the
fine
work
xander
did
on
that
replacing
that
window
sash
you
can't
even
tell
it's
new
it
blends
in
so
well
he's
extraordinary
this
is
xander
and
anya
interview
number
1
for
buffy
a
slayer
of
the
vampyrs
either
that
or
buffy
the
slayer
who
knew
no
fear
thank
you
xander
that's
sweet
of
you
i
understand
that
exactly
one
year
ago
today
you
left
anya
at
the
altar
any
comment
on
that
i
just
think
people
will
be
interested
but
you
think
it
was
something
that
called
for
an
apology
so
you
don't
think
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
interesting
i
think
we're
getting
something
here
is
that
true
xander
do
you
still
love
her
ok
spike
the
light
was
kind
of
behind
you
ooh
that
would
be
very
exciting
on
tape
well
right
now
i'm
really
more
about
the
recording
of
the—
jesus
desme
abdo
tay
deborah
what
does
it
mean
what
does
it
mean
we're
fugitives
haunted
by
our
past
tormented
by
a
message
we
don't
understand
we're
men
of
hidden
power
tortured
from
within
byby
a
voice
from
out
of
nowhere
i
thought
you
were
evil
sure
i
respected
your
ideas
for
evil
projects
and
i
thought
you
had
good
followthrough
i
don't
want
to
do
this
anymore
everyone's
staring
at
me
but
it
tickles
and
i'm
all
tense
can't
i
have
a
cool
refreshing
zima
ii
don't
know
stuff
happened
i
forget
but
i—i'm
not
a
part
of
this
i
document
i
don't
participate
i'm
a
detached
journalist
recording
with
a
neutral
eye
i
wasn't
off
topic
it's
gonna
get
relevant
in
a
second
because
jonathan's
gonna
go
to
the
bathroom
la
cucaracha
la
cucaracha
la
la
la
la
la
oh
gosh
gosh
i'm
glad
to
see
you
am
i
iprobably
have
pillow
creases
yeah
it
wasn't
easy
i
had
to
meet
this
demon
guy
who
sells
all
kinds
of
weird
weapons
and
stuff
well
i
didn't
buy
them
but
there
were
poison
arrows
and
this
sort
of
collapsible
sword—
oh
right
oh
it'll
be
a
while
he's
got
a
shy
bladder
jonathan
you
ok
in
there
pretty
knife
except
the
uh
the
stabbing—i
don't—i
don't
think
i
can
do
it
jonathan
has
been
a
good
friend
to
me
here
in
mehico
he
said
he'll
buy
me
a
burro
we
live
as
gods
we
are
gods
oh
we
are
gods
we
are
as
gods
we
are
as
gods
got
it
if
i
kill
him
with
this
knife
we
live
as
gods
you
mean
this
part
we
are
as
gods
it's
not
in
my
stuff
it's
in
the
kitchen
in
the
cutlery
drawer
you
didn't
have
any
steak
knives
i
washed
it
there
was
some
carving
on
the
blade
i
just
thought
it
was
a
pattern
whoa
you
were
right
it's
in
tawarick
it's
uh
like
prototawarick
it's
really
really
old
yeah
i'm
ok
with
it
it
says
the
blood
which
i
spill
i
consecrate
to
the
oldest
evil
check
out
spike
and
the
principal
there's
something
going
on
there
sexual
tension
you
could
cut
with
a
knife
oh
god
struck
down
before
i
achieve
redemption
so
i'll
be
staying
here
with
these
men
helping
out
that
holding
the
line
thing
i'll
be
with
buffy
we
make
our
way
down
the
stairs
carefully
alert
for
any
danger
i
was
just—
but
i
just—i
just
want
the
world
to
see
what
you
do
ooh
i
like
that
yeah
well
see
about
that—we
just
keep
tossing
that
word
around
but
that's
not
really
what
happened
it
was
confusing
jonathan
and
i
were
digging
but
warren
was
there
and
only
i
could
see
him—
not
one
of
them
cares
about
you
no
i
can't
do
it
this
isn't
right
no
but
did
you
actually
think
i
could
use
this
he's
making
me
do
it
no
see
i'm
a
man
trapped
by
circumstances
into
paying
for
a
crime
i
didn't
even—
what
yes
yes
see
die
die
die
what
have
i
done
get
out
of
my
brain
aaaah
did
not
did—uh
hey
here
we
are
she's
like
a
woman
fighting
for
more
than
life
she
fights
like
fighting
is
her
life
it's
like
the
air
she
breathes
and
she
knows
she
will
win
because
there
is
no
alternative
so
you
figure
what
i
uh
i
stand
on
the
seal
and
hold
the
knife
and
command
it
to
stop
glowing
in
tawarick
what
blood
opens
it
you
don't
want
to
open
it
opening
it
would
be
bad
so
how
much
bloodare
you
gonna—
so
this
is
my
redemption
at
last
i
buy
back
my
bruised
soul
with
the
blood
of
my
heart
butbut
not
enough
to
kill—
sorry
sorry
please
don't
kill
me
warren
said
jonathan
would
be
ok
i
trusted
him
and
i
lost
my
friend
i
know
but
you
don't
need
to
kill
me
you
said
we
could
all
get
through
this
no
you're
doing
great
really
kudos
don't
please
don't
please
no
because
i
killed
him
because
i
listened
to
warren
and
i
pretended
i
thought
it
was
him
but
i
knew—i
knew
it
wasn't
and
i
killed
jonathan
and
now
you're
gonna
kill
me
and
i'm
scared
and
i'm
going
to
die
and
this—this
is
what
jonathan
felt
it
stopped
thanks
you—you
weren't
really
going
to
stab
me
were
you
what
if
the
tears
didn't
work
here's
the
thing
i
killed
my
best
friend
there's
a
big
fight
coming
and
i
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
i
don't
even
think
i'm
going
to
live
through
it
that's
uh
probably
the
way
it
should
be
i
guess
i'm—
