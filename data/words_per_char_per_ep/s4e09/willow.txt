the
beer
part
then
oh
right

the
truth
spell
but
i
didn't
—
shirk
i
did
the
research
and
i
picked
up
the
motherwort
i
just
forgot
the
doing
the
spell
part
i
know
ii've
been
off
ii
even
tried
to
do
a
spell
last
night
to
have
my
will
done
i
was
hoping
it
would
make
me
feel
better
but
it
just
went
kablooey
well
that's
not
true
i
said
i
was
off
not
incompetent
so
i
get
punished
‘cause
i'm
in
pain
oh
you
care
yeah
everybody
cares
nobody
wants
to
be
inconvenienced
you
all
want
me
to
take
the
time
and
go
through
the
pain
as
long
as
you
don't
have
to
hear
about
it
anymore
isn't
it
‘cause
i'm
doing
the
best
i
can
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
enough
for
you
guys
no
you
don't
you
say
that
you
do
but
you
don't
see
anything
i
mean
i'm
going
through
something
i
just
don't
see
why
he
was
getting
down
on
me
i
am
a
bad
witch
i'm
not
kidding
anyone
if
i
had
any
real
power
i
could
have
made
oz
stay
with
me
and
i
didn't
have
the
guts
to
do
the
spell
on
veruca
and
my
i
will
it
so
spell
went
nowhere
the
only
real
witch
here
is
fuzzy
little
amy
she's
got
access
to
powers
i
can't
even
invoke
i
mean
first
—
she's
a
perfectly
normal
girl
then
poof
—
she's
a
rat
i
could
never
do
something
like
that
aand
you're
going
now
well
i
mean
what's
the
rush
spike
can't
hurt
anyone
right
and
i
figured
since
i'm
kinda
grievey
we
could
uhyou
know
have
a
girl's
night
we
could
eat
sundaes
and
watch
steel
magnolias
and
you
can
tell
me
how
at
least
i
don't
have
diabetes
i
don't
see
the
big
he's
probably
just
standing
out
there
you
could
find
him
in
two
seconds
i
mean
i'm
going
through
something
you'd
think
every
once
in
a
while
buffy
would
make
best
friends
a
priority
spike's
more
important
than
me
i
get
it
well
fine
why
doesn't
so
just
go
marry
him
it's
just
not
fair
yeah
‘cause
most
relationships
are
great
and
troublefree
i
don't
think
so
i
think
we're
all
doomed
to
badness
oh
yeah
let'slet's
look
at
your
bio
insect
lady
mummy
girl
anya
you're
a
demon
magnet
ii'm
sorry
i'll
try
for
a
quiet
rage
bye
pain
what
pain
oh
god
but
i
didn't
mean
to
no
please
you
have
to
help
them
really
no
offense
intended
i
mean
you've
been
supernice
and
everything
but
i
don't
want
to
be
a
demon
i
just
wanna
go
back
and
help
my
friends
itit
is
let
the
healing
power
begin
let
my
will
be
safe
again
as
these
words
of
peace
are
spoken
let
this
harmful
spell
be
broken
hi
guys
oh
until
i
don't
feel
so
horribly
guilty
i
figure
about
a
million
chips
from
now
also
i
have
to
detail
giles'
car
look
cookies
a
very
notevil
thing
i
did
oatmeal
eat
a
cookie
ease
my
pain
well
baking
lifts
about
30
of
my
guilt
but
only
7
of
my
inner
turmoil
guess
that'll
just
take
a
while
did
i
mention
about
the
sorry
part
well
atat
least
you
were
getting
along
what
