is
there
something
you
want
to
tell
me
well
it's
good
that
you're
so
open
about
it
we
were
talking
about
having
a
picnic
practicing
boy
that's
just
what
every
girl
longs
to
hear
like
an
exam
right
around
beautiful
it's
just
different
you
know
a
picnic
first
of
all
daylight
—
kind
of
a
new
venue
buffywise
and
the
best
part
—
he
said
he
would
bring
all
the
food
so
all
i
have
to
do
was
to
show
up
and
eat
those
are
two
things
i'm
really
good
at
very
very
yeah
he's—
have
you
seen
his
arms
those
are
good
arms
to
have
i
really
like
him
i
do
i
don't
know
i
really
like
being
around
him
you
know
and
i
think
he
cares
about
me
but
i
just
feel
like
something's
missing
exactly
riley
seems
so
solid
like
he
wouldn't
cause
me
heartache
i
know
i
have
to
get
away
from
that
bad
boy
thing
there's
no
good
there
seeing
angel
in
la
even
for
five
minutes
hello
to
the
pain
but
i
can't
help
thinking
—
isn't
that
where
the
fire
comes
from
can
a
nice
safe
relationship
be
that
intense
i
know
it's
nuts
but
part
of
me
believes
that
real
love
and
passion
have
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
pain
and
fighting
i
wonder
where
i
get
that
from
soyou
saw
their
faces
but
you
can't
describe
them
uh
huh
and
the
lab
okay
that's
it
the
invalid
amnesiac
routine
is
over
the
kitchen
is
closed
until
you
can
tell
me
something
useful
about
the
commandos
how
long
are
you
going
to
pull
this
crap
flaccid
giles
help
he's
going
to
scold
me
you
know
what
i
don't
think
you
want
us
to
let
you
go
maybe
we
made
it
a
little
too
comfy
in
here
for
ya
you
want
something
nicer
a
look
at
my
poor
neck
all
bare
and
tender
and
exposed
all
that
blood
just

pumping
away
bye
she
still
has
a
way
to
go
but
yeah

i
think
she's
dealing
