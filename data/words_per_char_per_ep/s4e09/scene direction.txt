jumps
out
from

stakes
him
without
so
much
as
looking

crumbles
to

playing
coy

straw
protruding
from

contains
blood

it
to
buffy
without
saying
a
word
she
takes
it
sighs
and
makes
a
face
as
she
puts
it
close
enough
to
spike
that
he
can
suck
through
the
straw
he
makes
a
big
to
do
out
of
it
so
as
to
disgust
her
more
buffy
pulls
the
mug
away
leaving

with
the
straw
dangling
from
between
his
lips
buffy
sarcastically

growls
trying
to
grab
buffy
but
the
chains
hold
him
and
only
make
his
struggles
comical

she
leans
her
head
to
the

smiles
softly
and
joins

blue
gleam
as

speaks
the
words

is
covered
with
grass
no
sign
of
