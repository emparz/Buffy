look
look
spike
—
we
have
no
intention
of
killing
a
harmless
uh
creature
but
we
have
to
know
what's
been
done
to
you
we
can't
let
you
go
until
we're
sure
that
you're

impotent
—
sorry
poor
choice
of
words
until
we're
sure
you're
you're
oh
please
if
those
two
don't
kill
each
other
i
might
lend
a
hand
a
truth
spell
of
course
why
didn't
i
think
of
that
yes
we'll
have
a
go
excellent
great
thank
you
willow
um
willow
may
have
had
a
very
helpful
idea
she
seems
to
be
coping
better
with
oz's
departure
don't
you
think
oh
uh
willow
it's
giles
um
i
thought
you
were
bringing
the
ingredients
for
that
spell
i
really
have
to—
you'll
do
what
lick
me
to
death
look
uh
willow
i
think
we
ought
to
try
the
spell
among
other
things
i'd
like
to
shower
sometime
today
alone
i'm
a
bit
concerned
about
you
actually
uh
buffy
didn't
tell
me
anything
happily
i
came
because
we
had
an
appointment
the
other
day
yes
um
willow
i
know
that
you're
going
through
a
very
difficult
time
but
shirking
your
responsibilities—
well
that
isn't
like
you
at
all
a
spell
i
don't
think
it's
wise
for
you
to
be
doing
that
alone
right
now
your
energy's
too
unfocused
i
only
meant
that
you're
grieving
and
it
might
be
wise
if
you
took
a
break
from
doing
spells
without
supervision
it's
not
punishment
i'm
only
saying
this
because
i—
no
that's
not
fair
and
i
see
how
you
could
feel
that
way
i
do—
um
oh
sorry
um
sorry
pperhaps
i'd
better
be
going
let's
um
let's
talk
about
this
later
oh
i'm
sorry
so
sorry
elobe
enemy
be
now
quiet
yes
well
you
might
have
thought
about
that
sooner
um
let
your
deceitful
tongue
be
be
uh
let
no
untruths
be
spoken
hm
oh
nothing
i
just
got
ash
in
my
eye
t'would
be
a
generous
ending
for
you
spike
uhuhum
just
a
minute
if
the
two
of
you
could
remain
civil
long
enough
to—
willow
it'sit's
me
something's
happened
i
need
your
help
i
can't
see
very
well
everything's
blurred
i'm
certain
it's
a
spell
of
some
kind
because
wellit
seems
something
else
is
going
wrong

horribly
wrong
yes
please
stop
thankfully
not
very
well
oh
buffy
that's
that's
so
oh
for
god's
sake
this
is
nonsense
something
is
making
you
act
this
way
don't
you
realize
what
you're
doing
he's
gonna
have
to
take
a
bit
of
time
to
get
used
to
it
pet
i
rather
think
not
i
seem
to
be
rather
rather
blind
completely
in
fact
a
spell
i
believe
are
you
helping
me
that's
alright
i
have
more
scotch
so
the
plan
is
to
cure
my
total
incapacitating
blindness

tomorrow
stop
that
right
now
i
can
hear
the
smacking
huh
such
a
good
question
what's
going
on
please
stop
whatever
you're
doing
you
smell
like
fruit
rollups
three
excellent
questions
and
that
i
didn't
see
anything
yes
to
have
her
will
done
whatever
she
says
is
coming
true
people
willow
is
out
there
and
she
probably
doesn't
know
what
she's
doing
aha
five
past
two
thursday
yes
very
funny
they're
chocolate
chip
i
can
see
them

more
specific
and
give
me
