uh
some
sort
of
i've
been
all
over
downtown
and
i
can't
find
his
place
so
let's
go
anything
spike
if
you're
dragging
this
out
like
you've
never
drawn
things
out
before
will
you
quit
that
the
only
thing
that's
different
is
that
i'm
disgusted
with
myself
that's
the
power
of
your
charms
last
night

was
the
most
perverse

degrading
experience
of
my
life
that
might
be
how
you
get
off
but
it's
not
my
style
not
love
that
that's
it
i
want
you
out
of
my
life
out
of
my
work
out
of
my
home
i'll
find
dawn
myself
dawn
now
you're
scared
better
late
than
never
dawn
what
happened
are
you
okay
i
need
to
see
okay
let
me
see
your
arm
okay
we
need
to
get
her
to
a
doctor
back
off
will
i
got
her
i
mean
it
stay
away
from
her
get
up
yeah
you
know
what
you
did
screw
up
okay
you
could
have
killed
her
you
almost
did
you
can
she's
sleeping
the
er
doc
gave
her
something
for
the
pain
it
knocked
her
out
it's
a
fracture
you
know
it's
gonna
take
some
time
i
just
don't
understand
i
don't
understand
why
you'd
go
to
see
somebody
like
rack
and
i
certainly
don't
understand
why
you'd
drag
dawn
into
it
because
of
tara
seemed
like
things
were
going
so
well
will
there's
nothing
wrong
with
you
you
don't
need
magic
to
be
special
you
are
more
than
some
girl
and
tara
wants
you
to
stop
she
loves
you
i
know
that
i
promise
you
i
get
that
more
than
you
but
it's
wrong
people
get
hurt
i
know
good
i
think
it's
right
to
give
it
up
no
matter
how
good
it
feels
there
you
go
now
i
don't
have
to
exactly
it's
over
