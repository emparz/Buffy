i'm
sorry
but
this
is
pointless
we've
been
researching
forever
and
we're
not
even
close
to
finding
out
who
robbed
that
museum
don't
be
ridiculous
martha
stewart
isn't
a
demon
she's
a
witch
of
course
nobody
could
do
that
much
decoupage
without
calling
on
the
powers
of
darkness
i
know
i
do
i
can't
decide
whether
to
put
my
bridesmaids
in
cocktail
dresses

or
the
traditional
burlap
with
blood
larva
well
i
was
a
demon
for
a
thousand
years
you
don't
expect
me
to
turn
my
back
on
all
the
ways
of
my
people
at
least
i'm
not
asking
you
to
perform
the
groom's
rite
of
selfflagellation
what
about
willow
can't
she
do
something
and
i'm
bizarre
at
least
i
didn't
dump
you
to
hang
out
with
an
exrat
yeah
all
we're
saying
is
she's
acting
different
you
know
she's
not
herself
