it
was
an
earthquake
buffy
a
not
uncommon
occurrence
in
southern
california
no
reason
to
think
it
was
anything
more
yes
i
know
that

and

therefore
i
completely
understand
your
anxiety
but
unless
evidence
suggests
otherwise
i
think
that
we
can
assume
that
it's
shifting
landmasses
and
not
a
portent
of
some
imminent
doom
now
in
the
meantime
i've
got
a
few
theories
about
our
mysterious
commando
friends
now
based
on
the
locations
of
our
various
sightings
and

spike's
reluctant
description
of
their
underground
installation
buffy

if
the
quake
heralds
some
such
catastrophe
i'm
sure
there
will
be
other
signs
to
follow
which
will
afford
us
plenty
of
time
to
avert
it
now

i
believe
that
the
commando
installation
is
either
very
close
to
or
directly
underneath
your
school
now
if
that
is
the
case
i'm
convinced
that
one
or
more
of
them
may
be
in
your
very
midst
what
buffy
will
you
stop
worrying
about
what
may
be
and
concentrate
on
what
is
vigilance
is
all
very
good
but
as
we
are
getting
close
the
is
a
much
more
pressing
question
it's
the
end
of
the
world
it's
ah
the
earthquake

that
symbol
yes
i'm
so
very
sorry
my
contrition
completely
dwarfs
the
impending
apocalypse
it's
the
end
of
the
world
everyone
dies
it's
rather
important
really
a
vahrall
demon
yes
‘slick
like
gold
and
gird
in
moonlight
father
of
portents
and
brother
to
blight'
oh
–
as
usual
–
dear
it's
my
fault
i
should
have
known
the
word
of
valios
–
is
the
name
of
a
talisman
–
not
a
book
i
blame
myself
entirely
i
had
it
here
oh
thank
you
i
bought
it
at
a
sorcerer's
estate
sale
i
really
only
glanced
at
it
once
i
thought
it
was
a
knock
off
they're
on
their
way
to
perform
the
sacrifice
now
the
hellmouth
they
are
going
to
open
the
hellmouth

the
one
in
the
library
