i
guess
we
do
somebody
should
speak
before
one
of
us
graduates
capricorn
on
the
cusp
of
aquarius
you
also
passionate
artistic
and
inquisitive

who
are
you
well
then
let
me
you're
part
of
some
military
monster
squad
that
captures

demons
vampires
probably
have
some
official
sounding
euphemisms
for
them

like
unfriendlies
or
–
nonsapiens
so
you
deliver
these
–
hsts
to
a
bunch
of
lab
coats
who
perform
experiments
on
them
which
among
other
things
turn
some
into
harmless
little
bunnies
how
am
i
doing
so
far
meanwhile
by
day
you
pretend
to
be
riley
finn
cornfed
iowa
boy
ever
been
to
iowa
riley
god
if
that's
even
your
name
i
thought
a
professional
demon
chaser
like
yourself
would
have
figured
it
out
by
now

i'm
the
slayer
slayer

chosen
one
she
who
hangs
out
a
lot
in
cemeteries

you're
kidding

up

slayer
comma
the
you
did
pretty
well
yourself
you're
not
looking
hard
enough
i
don't
know

i
just
i
really
thought
that
you
were
a
nice
normal
guy
maybe
by
this
town's
standards
but
i'm
not
grading
on
a
curve
i
think
we
both
need
a
little
time
to
–
process
everything
maybe
then
i
won't
say
a
word
sorry
i'm
so
excited
this
is
my
first
earthquake
it's
not
mine
yeah
a
couple
of
broken
knickknacks
but
no
biggies
ah
this
from
the
dorm
that
brought
us
the
‘somebody
sneezed'
party
and
the
‘day
that
ends
in
y'
party
ah
riley
is
–
ahm
busy
i'm
pretty
sure
but
you
know
you
go
on
ahead
and
i'll
catch
up
with
you
there
i'm
on
my
way
for
a
little
giles
oneonone
wrong
no
mmmm
not
at
all
something
horrible
is
going
to
happen
giles
oh
i
so
have
a
reason
a
darn
good
reason
the
last
time
we
had
an
earthquake
i
died
oh
good
because
i'd
hate
for
my
little
untimely
horrible
death
concern
to
be
ambiguous
oh

really
what
if
the
quake
was
a
sign
ah
a
bad
omen
and
we
just
ignore
it
there
is
going
to
be
a
lot
of
red
faces
when
the
world
comes
to
an
end
plague
what
if
the
end
of
the
world
is
coming
in
the
form
of
a
plague
then
too
many
people
may
be
infected
by
the
time
we
actually
wow
i
wasn't
sure
where
the
party
was
and
then
i
saw
the
flashing
lights
and
the
ambulance
and
i
was
like
right
of
course
death
carnage
–
it's
a
buffy
party
what
happened
god
are
you
okay
vampire
percy
called
you
a
nerd
does
he
even
go
here
tell
me
about
this
symbol
i'm
telling
you
i've
seen
this
somewhere
before
i
just
can't
remember
where
i
mean
it's
like
i
told
you
ii
said
end
of
the
world
and
you're
like
poopoo
southern
california
poopoo
i
stop
it
i
wonder
where
i've
seen
this
before
where
else
the
place
i
spend
most
of
my
waking
hours
memorizing
stuff
of
the
sides
of
mausoleums
big
freaky
cereal
boxes
of
death
door
was
open
where
did
it
go
and
you
didn't
follow
it
i
do
lilac
very
commandory
–
lilac
not
withstanding
what
are
you
doing
here
i
have
to
–
get
the
demon
it's
not
that
simple
riley
i
just
can't
can't
any
of
it

i
can't
be
with
you

it's
just
a
huge
black
pit
of
a
mistake
and
i
can't
go
there
again
no
look
i
was
involved
you
don't
know
what
my
life
is
like
dying
being
the
operative
word
here
okay
there
is
too
much
risk
there
is
too
much
it's
just
doomed
and
i
can't
do
doomed
again
right
now
sorry
but
that's
not
enough
pain

death

apocalypse

none
of
it
fun
–
do
you
know
what
a
hellmouth
is
do
you
have
a
fancy
term
for
it
because
i
went
to
high
school
on
it
for
three
years
we
do
not
have
that
much
in
common
this
is
a
job
to
you
it's
an
adventure
great
but
for
me
it's
destiny
it
is
something
that
i
can't
change
something
that
i
can't
escape
i'm
stuck
riley
no
riley

my
answer
is
no
limbs
with
talons
eyes
like
knives
bane
to
the
blameless
thief
of
lives
this
thing
isn't
digging
up
the
bones
of
a
child
for
fun
let
me
guess
–
ends
the
world
no
they
won't
because
claw
boy
is
not
getting
all
of
his
ingredients
we
have
to
find
that
third
one
the
word
of
valios
keep
him
from
getting
it
i'll
check
the
magic
shop
see
if
they've
heard
of
a
book
called
the
word
of
valios
willow
xander
how
about
the
book
archives
at
the
museum
you
guys
this
thing
takes
wicked
very
seriously
be
careful
i
couldn't
stand
anybody
getting
hurt
is
this
really
the
time
for
donkey
kong
and
actually
i
need
to
go
big
bad
needs
to
be
squished
i
know
which
is
why
we
can't
do
it
the
you
and
me
thing
wow
with
sweet
talk
like
that
you'll
definitely
melt
my
reservations
you
know
there
is
nothing
more
dangerous
than
a
psychgradstudent
yeah
but
you're
an
amateur
–
fry
cook
and
i
come
form
a
long
line
of
fry
cooks
that
don't
live
past
25
fun
the
last
person
i
know
that
believed
that
is
in
a
coma
right
now
because
she
had
so
much
fun
on
the
job
that
i
should
just
turn
my
frown
upside
down
is
that
it
i
wish
i
could
but
this
isn't
the
kind
of
gig
where
you
can
just
hang
it
up
at
the
end
of
the
night
and
snuggle
with
your
honey
because
i've
tried
it
okay
and
every
time
it
just
fell
apart
and
then
i
get
sucked
right
back
in
to
the
uberevil
you
have
no
idea
what
you're
talking
about
you
barely
know
me
you
are
so
out
of
line
is
my
business
so
why
don't
you
just
leave
me
alone
what
happened
giles
well
they
have
it
and
they
probably
have
their
sacrifices
by
now
too
on
their
way
where
you
found
out
what
the
ritual
is
for
looks
like
we're
going
back
to
high
school
be
careful
you
guys
the
place
doesn't
look
to
stable
why
is
he
even
here
it's
not
like
he
can
fight
and
that's
bad
because

fine
whatever
just
keep
him
out
of
the
way
i
do
not
have
time
for
this
okay
when
we
get
to
the
library
keep
a
look
out
for
victims
they're
keeping
alive
for
the
sacrifice
getting
them
out
is
the
first
priority
okay
–
you
guys
ready
three
of
them
they
must
be
around
here
somewhere
the
ritual
is
not
finished
and
it's
not
gonna
be
get
out
of
here
the
building
is
going
to
come
down
don't
let
it
jump
into
the
hellmouth
i'm
going
in
no
offence
but
you
do
look
wicked
conspicuous
you
never
called
so
i
didn't
know
you
have
a
security
code
and
rank
no
it's
not
