i
guess
we
have
to
talk
what
are
you
sorry
that
came
out
a
little
blunter
than
i
intended

it's
just
you
are
amazing
your
speed
your
strength
you
know
who
i
am
the
rest
what
i
do
i
can't
tell
you
hostile
sub
terrestrials
a
little
too
well
it
is
born
and
raised
and
hey
bulletin
i'm
not
the
only
one
who's
been
a
little
less
than
honest
here
and
you
fight
demons
i
mean
you
waled
on
those
guys
but
i'm
a
walking
bruise
today
you
see
me
with
my
clothes
off
i
look
like
i
mean
i
have
–
bruises
i
don't
see
a
scratch
on
you
i'm
looking
pretty
hard
so
then
what
do
we
do
i
am
a
nice
normal
guy
yeah
yeah
i
think
that's
a
good
idea
oh

i
don't
think
i
need
to
tell
you
good
it'll
be
safer
for
all
over
here
wow
that
was
some
ride
what's
a
slayer
no
a
girl
with
powers
fill
me
in
you're
telling
me
she
doesn't
exist
how
do
you
explain
the
things
we
deal
with
forrest
never
mind
animals
rattling
their
cages
doing
it
all
day
wonder
what's
got
them
all
worked
up
i'm
just
trying
to
–
make
up
my
mind
about
something

buffy

she's
pretty
cool
isn't
she
one
of
ours
no
i'll
go
do
a
little
recon
see
if
it
falls
in
our
domain
you
alert
prof
walsh
tell
her
we
have
a
casualty
of
an
indeterminate
nature
let's
not
make
a
move
until
we
get
the
whole
story
wow
that
flippything
you
did
i
saw
it
take
off
towards
the
woods
no
weapons
no
backup
you
don't
go
after
a
demon
that
size
by
yourself
yeah
well
i'm
no
slayer
base
one
this
is
lilac
one
confirmed
sighting
of
an
unidentified
subt
mobilize
patrol
team
for
debriefing
at
o800
hours
looking
for
you
she
who
hangs
out
in
cemeteries
don't
sweat
it
we'll
bag
it
yeah
but

i
really
think
can't
talk
again
you've
dated
me
before
but
i'm
dying
to
find
out
ii
don't
understand
where
this
is
coming
from
i
know
you
like
me
and
it's
not
like
we
don't
have
anything
in
common
buffy
i'm
thrown
by
this
i'm
confused

but
i
can
feel
my
skin
humming
my
hands
my
every
inch
of
me
i've
never
been
this
excited
about
anybody
before
i'm
not
trying
to
scare
you
and
i'm
not
going
to
force
myself
on
you
but
i'm
by
god
not
going
to
walk
away
because
i
think
it
might
not
work
i
don't
know
what's
happened
in
your
past
it's
not
just
a
job
you
don't
have
to
be
you're
not
in
high
school
anymore
you
can
change
things
i
know
it
may
seem
three
meters
tall
approximately
100
–120
kilograms
based
on
my
visual
analysis
unknown
probably
nothing
we
haven't
handled
before
there
is
no
pattern
we
can
discern
yet
so
we
got
to
assume
that
it
is
on
a
basic
killcrushdestroy
here
is
one
for
the
good
guys
this
thing
has
a
pheromone
signature
a
mile
wide
agent
gates
has
been
working
with
the
detection
system
the
lab's
developing
we're
going
out
in
civies
day
clothes
only
guys
weapons
stowed
in
packs
keep
‘em
out
of
sight
til
nightfall
remember
this
isn't
a
capture
it's
a
kill
buffy
what
oh
it
ah
takes
trace
readings
of
creatures
pheromones
and
it's
either
mating
season
for
this
thing
or
it's
moving
all
over
town

you
know
buffy
right
i'm
on
it
too
it's
just

this
thing
this
you
and
me
thing
it's
stupid
no
i
mean
you're
stupid
i
mean
–
i
don't
mean
that
–
no
i
think
maybe
i
do
i'm
serious
you
have
this
twisted
way
of
looking
at
things
this
doom
and
gloom
mentality
you
keep
thinking
like
that
and
things
will
probably
turn
out
just
the
way
you
expect
buffy
where
is
the
bad
here
it
just
turns
out
–
we
are
even
more
wellmatched
than
we
thought
we
were
i
mean
you're
a
–
fry
cook
–
and
so
am
i
which
is
exactly
the
attitude
i'm
talking
about
look
i
know
the
risks
of
what
we
do
i
also
know
it's
more
rewarding
than
any
other
job
on
the
planet
–
and
fun
i'm
not
saying
that
you
shouldn't
take
your
work
seriously
but
why
why
can't
it
be
welcome
to
the
story
of
the
world
things
fall
apart
buffy
and
evil
–
it
comes
and
goes
but
the
way
people
manage
is
they
don't
do
it
alone
they
pull
each
other
through
if
you
weren't
so
selfinvolved
you'd
see
that
i
know
that
it's
not
just
a
job
thing
i'm
sure
that
there
is
some
goodlooking
guy
that
done
you
wrong
in
there
too
but
mostly
i
think
you
want
to
stay
down
in
that
dark
place
because
maybe
it's
safer
down
there
no
see
i
don't
think
so
look
we
have
an
opportunity
here
you
and
me
and
the
fact
that
you're
too
scared
to
even
give
it
a
try
fair
enough
you're
coming
back
out
buffy
well
hey
willow
–
and
xander
right
jeez
what
are
the
chances
huh
yeah
i
was
just
passing
by
when
i
thought
i
heard
people
inside
i
do
but
it's
–
paintball
yeah
i
was
playing
paintball
and
then
the
aftershocks
oh
no
no
no
no
commando
no
i
mean
don't
i
know
you
oh
that's
nice
come
in
oh
hey
–
i'm
sorry
i'm
just
–
i'm
a
dead
man
–
secret
highly
–
or
it's
supposed
to
be
and
–
and
then
you
find
out
i
can
deal
you're
special
but
last
night
with
your
friends
was
a
disaster
i
mean
could
i've
been
less
convincing
i
was
trained
to
be
sneaky
and
stuff
and
i'm
like
–
hi
paintball
–
just
passing
by
i
should
have
just
given
them
my
security
code
and
rank
no
did
i
just
say
this
is
so
not
good
everybody
knows
about
me
i'm
finished
it's
the
end
of
the
world
