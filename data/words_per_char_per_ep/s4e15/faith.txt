just
when
we
made
it
so
nice

like
it

the
big
girl
on
campus
thing's
really
working
for
you
i've
been
standing
still
for
eight
months
b
how
hard
did
you
look
fivebyfive
it's
that
thing
about
a
coma
wake
up
all
rested
and
rejuvenated
and
ready
for
payback
what
did
you
think
i'd
wake
up
and
we'd
go
for
tea
you
tried
to
gut
me
bonny
lets
have
another
go
at
it
see
who
ends
on
top
actually
i
think
it
has
to
be
exactly
like
this
no
such
animal
i
could
say
the
same
about
you
i
mean
you're
still
the
same
betterthanthou
buffy
i
mean
i
knew
it
somehow
i
kept
having
this
dream
i'm
not
sure
what
it
means
but
in
the
dream
the
selfrighteous
blond
chick
stabs
me
and
you
wanna
know
why
that's
one
interpretation
but
in
my
dream
she
does
it
for
a
guy
try
it
red
and
you'll
lose
an
arm
i
wake
up
to
find
the
blond
chick
isn't
even
dating
the
guy
she
was
so
nuts
about
before
i
mean
she's
moved
on
to
the
first
college
beefstick
she
meets
not
only
has
she
forgotten
about
the
love
of
her
life
but
she's
forgotten
about
the
chick
she
nearly
killed
for
him
so
that's
my
dream
that
and
some
stuff
about
cigars
and
a
tunnel
but
tell
me
college
girl
what
does
it
mean
you
took
my
life
b
payback's
a
bitch

you
around
hi

come
in
ruby
sunsetburgendy
skylineharlot
mmmmmmm
way
to
go
joyce
now
normally
i
wouldn't
be
going
for
something
this
dark
but
i
read
in
some
magazine
that
eight
months
in
a
coma
will
damage
a
girl's
natural
skin
tone
good
thing
pale
is
in
this
yearn
or
was
it
last
year
anyway
for
real
now
i
wanna
ask
you
something
and
i
want
you
to
promise
to
be
honest
and
to
not
spare
my
feelings
just
because
i
could
kill
you
you
promise
ok
how
do
i
look
mmmmmmm
i
was
shooting
for
sultry
but
hey

i
know
what
you're
thinking

thinking
you'll
never
get
away
with
this
moi
that
a
fact
whoa
you
got
a
pair
on
you
joyce
i
like
seeing
that
in
a
woman
your
age
guess
you
can
afford
to
talk
that
way
i
mean
in
the
world
according
to
joyce
buffy
is
gonna
come
crashing
through
that
door
any
minute
but
look
what
i
found
buffy
summers
buffy
summers
buffy
summers
buffy
buffy
buffy
lotta
letters
she
hasn't
been
by
in
a
while
huh
and
you'd
think
with
a
crazy
chick
like
me
on
the
loose
crazy
chick
with
a
wicked
grudge
against
her
no
less
she'd
call
give
you
a
headsup
but
buffy's
too
into
her
own
deal
to
remember
dear
old
mom
don't
i
i
know
what
it's
like
you
think
you
matter
you
think
you're
a
part
of
something
and
you
get
dumped
it's
like
the
whole
world
is
moving
and
you're
stuck
it's
like
those
animals
in
the
tar
pits
it's
like
you
just
keep
sinking
a
little
deeper
everyday
and
noone
even
sees
don't
tell
me
you
don't
see
it
joyce
you've
served
you
purpose
squirted
out
the
kids
raised
her
up
and
now
you
might
as
well
be
dead
nobody
cares
nobody
remembers
especially
not
buffy
fabulous
superhero
sooner
or
later
you're
going
to
have
to
face
it
she
was
over
us
a
long
time
ago
joyce
too
busy
climbing
onto
her
new
boytoy
to
give
a
single
though
to
the
people
that
matter
i
mean
you're
her
mother
and
she
just
leaves
you
hear
to
die
thought
i'd
go
after
the
queen
marine
didn't
ya
he's
a
cutie
looks
like
he
could
use
a
good
roll
in
the
sack
he's
probably
just
never
tried
it
just
something
to
remember
me
by
once
i've
moved
on
