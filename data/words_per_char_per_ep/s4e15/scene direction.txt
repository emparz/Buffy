a
white
sheet
descends
and
we
see
buffy
draping
it
over
a
bed
she
is
in
her
bedroom
at
home
making
her
bed
through
the
windows
it
looks
like
its
late
afternoon
as
sunlight
shines
into
the
room
buffy
smoothing
the
edges
buffy
smiling
buffy
stops
smiling
buffy
hesitantly
faith
knowingly
they've
worked
their
way
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
now
and
are
beside
each
other
buffy
regretfully
she
stops
as
she
hears
something
she
looks
down
and
sees
that
two
drops
of
blood
have
hit
the
sheet
a
dark
red
on
the
clean
white
two
more
drops
quickly
follow
faith
looks
at
buffy
she
straightens
and
looks
down
at
her
body
as
she
faces
buffy
she
lifts
her
eyes
to
meet
buffy's
whose
expression
has
suddenly
become
stoic
faith
concerned
she
indicates
to
her
abdomen
close
up
of
buffy's
hand
wrapped
around
the
handle
of
faith's
large
knife
the
one
buffy
had
stabbed
her
with
cannot
see
the
blade
because
most
of
it
is
in
faith's
stomach
and
blood
is
seeping
from
the
wound
buffy's
face
is
emotionless
as
she
gazes
into
faith's
eyes
a
second
later
she
suddenly
jerks
the
knife
upwards
horrified
faith
opens
her
mouth
in
a
silent
scream
faith
is
in
a
room
that
obviously
doesn't
see
much
human
presence
from
a
window
we
cannot
see
lightning
flashes
outside
and
splashes
across
her
face
faith
continues
to
sleep
wolf's
howl
buffy
theme
and
credits
roll
fade
in
close
up
of
an
initiative
taser
rifle
the
top
panel
of
the
weapon
is
off
and
hanging
to
the
side
trailing
wires
as
xander
examines
the
inside
with
a
pair
of
pliers
in
his
hand
frustrated
xander
drops
the
pliers
on
the
counter
and
lets
the
rifle
fall
on
its
side
willow
eagerly
giles
folding
a
pair
of
boxers
buffy
turns
and
walks
towards
the
couch
xander
rights
the
rifle
again
and
picks
up
a
screwdriver
buffy
sits
down
on
the
couch
and
rests
her

worried
xander's
back
is
to
us
he's
leaning
over
the
blaster
when
it
suddenly
lets
out
a
big
spark
he
does
a
short
electrocuted
dance
as
he
holds
it
in
his
hands
and
a
puff
a
smoke
is
rising
from
the
gun
willow
unaware
of
the
blast
xander
has
let
go
of
the
blaster
and
turns
to
face
the
others
with
a
wideeyed
expression
on
his
face
he's
wavering
on
his
feet
still
feeling
the
effects
of
the
shock
and
sees
nobody
noticed
what
happened
without
a
word
he
turns
around
and
picks
up
the
weapon
again
to
continue
working
on
it
at
the
door
leading
into
the
infirmary

is
a
