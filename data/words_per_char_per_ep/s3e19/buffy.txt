sorry
honey
well
there's
something
you
don't
see
every
day
unless
of
course
you're
me
it's
what
i
live
for
sad
to
say
no
it's
just
do
you
get
the
feeling
that
we're
kind
of
in
a
rut
you
never
take
me
any
place
new
so
this
is
our
future
this
is
how
we're
going
to
spend
our
nights
when
i'm
fifty
and
you're

the
same
age
you
are
now
liking
that
plan
alright
busted
i
didn't
think
you'd
miss
them
right
it's
wonderful
you
said
that
before
mom
you
know
that
i
can't

ii
just
can't
decide
on
a
school
right
now
i
mean
i
want
to
sleep
on
it
you
know
mull
it
over
raise
them
up
my
inner
flagpole
see
which
one
i
salute
i
know
you're
proud
of
me
more
like
a
continent
she
just
has
to
realize
that
i
can't
go
away
faith's
turn
to
the
dark
side
of
the
force
pretty
much
put
the
proverbial
kibosh
on
any
away
plans
for
me
uc
sunnydale
â€“
at
least
i
got
in
you
i
mean
i
can't
believe
you
got
into
oxford
that's
where
they
make
gileses
making
the
open
dumpster
your
cafeteria
okay
you
guys
don't
forget
to
breathe
between
insults
well
i
don't
think
i
can
talk
any
slower
wes
i
want
to
leave
no
not
now
after
i
graduate
you
know
college
yeah
i'm
also
a
person
you
can't
just
define
me
by
my
slayerness
that's

somethingism
i
got
into
northwestern
i
bet
you
they
have
all
that
stuff
in
illinois
i
know
it's
complicated
i'm
aware
that
my
graduation
may
be
among
other
things
posthumous
but
what
if
i
stop
the
ascension
what
if
i
capture
faith
if
i
do
that
then
all
you
guys
have
to
do
is
keep
the
runofthemill
unholy
forces
at
bay
through
midterms
and
i'll
be
back
in
time
for
homecoming
and
every
school
break
after
that
can
we
at
least
think
about
it
i'll
make
them
different
i'm
tired
of
waiting
for
mayor
mcsleaze
to
make
his
move
while
we
sit
on
our
hands
counting
down
to
ascension
day
i
mean
let's
take
the
fight
to
him
i
gotta
have
a
plan
really
i
can't
just
be
proactive
with
pep
oh
i
actually
knew
that
i
thought
you
meant
a
more
specific
plan
you
know
like
with
maps
and
stuff
great
we'll
find
out
what
they're
up
to
so
what's
in
the
box
the
box
of
gavrock
it
houses
some
great
demonic
energy
or
something
which
his
honor
needs
to
chow
down
on
come
aday
the
box
is
being
kept
under
guard
in
a
conference
room
on
the
top
floor
there
unfortunately
that's
all
i
could
get
out
of
my
informant
before
his
aggressive
tendencies
forced
me
to
introduce
him
to
mr
pointy
i
figure
we
can
enter
through
the
skylight
i'll
take
angel
with
me
wes
hop
on
the
train
or
get
off
the
tracks
looks
like
a
job
for
wiccan
girl
what
do
you
say
will
big
time
danger
let's
get
to
work
four
stars
will
now
get
going
got
it
angel
i'd
like
very
much
to
come
up
now
please
angel
don't
suppose
you
want
to
help
me
get
down
didn't
think
so
how
did
you
guys
let

how
did
this
happen
look
it's
nobody's
fault
okay
we
just
need
to
focus
and
deal
oz
i
swear
i
won't
let
them
hurt
her
no
no
they
know
what
she
means
to
us
she's
too
valuable
as
long
as
we
still
have
the
box
we
trade
no
it's
the
safest
plan
it's
the
only
way
right
look
we
call
the
mayor
and
arrange
a
meeting
wes
you
want
to
duck
and
cover
at
this
point
there
is
no
other
way
you
think
i
care
about
that
are
you
made
of
human
parts
why
are
you
taking
his
side
giles
make
the
phone
call
one
way
out
means
one
way
in
i
want
to
see
them
coming
let
her
go
i
don't
think
we
need
to
talk
about
this
snyder
get
out
of
here
wait
listen
snyder
you
alive
in
there
we
did
alright
this
is
your
night
for
suave
will
you
should
get
captured
more
often
deep
and
meaningful
as
in
i'm
never
getting
out
of
here
i
kept
thinking
if
i
stopped
the
mayor
or

but
i
was
kidding
myself
i
mean
there
is
always
going
to
be
something
i'm
a
sunnydale
girl
no
other
choice
please
tell
me
you're
going
somewhere
with
this
uc
sunnydale
are
you
serious
i
can't
believe
it
are
you
serious
ah
wait
what
am
i
saying
you
can't
i
won't
let
you
there
are
better
schools
okay
well
there
are
safer
schools
there
are
safer
prisons
i
can't
let
you
stay
because
of
me
i
kind
of
love
you
i
feel
the
need
for
more
sugar
than
the
human
body
can
handle
yes
please
it's
weird
you
look
at
something
and
you
think
you
know
exactly
what
you're
seeing
and
then
you
find
out
it's
something
else
entirely
sometimes
it
is
it's
gonna
be
fun
will
and
i
are
going
to
go
on
saturday
to
check
out
the
campus
i'm
hoping
mom
will
let
me
live
there
it's
too
far
to
come
home
every
night
plus
the
whole
lack
of
cool
factor
either
way
i'll
be
close
to
your
place
i
don't
know
what
the
mayor
was
talking
about
how
could
he
know
anything
about
us
big
time
he
doesn't
even
know
what
a
lasting
relationship
is
probably
the
only
lasting
relationship
he's
ever
had
is
with
evil
big
stupid
evil
guy
we'll
be
okay
