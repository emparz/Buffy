alright
you
can
open
them
up
now
faith
as
if
i
need
a
reason
to
show
you
my
affection
or
appreciation
for
running
a
small
errand
at
the
airport
this
isn't
a
free
ride
young
lady
you
know
i'm
beginning
to
think
that
somebody's
getting
a
little
spoiled
maybe
i
should
take
this
back
that's
my
girl
another
cookie
now
a
package
is
arriving
tomorrow
night
from
central
america
something
and
i
can't
stress
this
enough
something
crucially
important
to
my
ascension
without
it

well
what
would
toll
house
cookies
be
without
the
chocolate
chips
a
pretty
darn
big
disappointment
i
can
tell
you
open
your
present
there
that
look
on
your
face
is
my
reward
well
it
cost
a
pretty
penny
so
you
just
take
good
care
of
it
and
you
be
careful
not
to
put
somebody's
eye
out
with
that
thing
until
i
tell
you
to
hey
ho
there
it
is
hahahaha
ah
what
happened
to
the
courier
i
was
supposed
to
pay
him
you
are
one
heck
of
a
girl
you
know
that
i
mean
geez
the
initiative
the

the
skill
i
will
you
know

tell
you
if
buffy

slayer

ever
need
what

cause
i
used
the
bword
huh

tell
me
you're
still
sore
about
that
whole
angelbuffy
thing
better
believe
she
can
she
deserves
that
poor
excuse
for
a
creature
of
the
night
you
on
the
other
hand
can
do
better
don't
do
that
well
this
is
very
unfortunate
i
just
had
this
conference
room
redecorated
for
pete's
sake
at
taxpayers'
expense
and
oh
yeah

they've
got
my
box
ever
had
a
dog
i
did
rusty
irish
setter
a
dog's
friendship
is
stronger
than
reason
stronger
than
it's
own
sense
of
selfpreservation
buffy's
like
a
dog
and
hey
before
you
can
say
jack
robinson
you'll
get
to
see
me
kill
her
like
one
girls
i
hope
i
don't
have
to
separate
you
two
faith
you
can
play
with
your
new
toy
later
something's
come
up
faith
you
know
i
don't
like
repeating
myself
i
just
received
a
heck
of
an
interesting
phone
call
well
this
is
exciting
isn't
it
clandestine
meetings
by
dark
of
night
exchange
of
prisoners
i
just
i
i
feel
like
we
should
all
be
wearing
trench
coats
no
not
until
the
box
is
in
my
hands
so
you're
the
little
girl
that's
been
causing
me
all
this
trouble
she's
pretty
angel
a
little
skinny
still
don't
understand
why
it
couldn't
work
out
with
you
and
my
faith
guess
you
kind
of
just
have
strange
taste
in
women
well
i
wish
you
kids
the
best
i
really
do
but
if
you
don't
mind
a
bit
of
fatherly
advice
i
uh
ii
just
don't
see
much
of
a
future
for
you
two
i
don't
sense
a
lasting
relationship
and
not
just
because
i
plan
to
kill
you
you
two
have
a
bumpy
road
ahead
god
you
kids
you
know
you
don't
like
to
think
about
the
future
you
don't
like
to
make
plans
unless
you
want
faith
to
gut
your
friend
like
a
sea
bass
show
a
little
respect
for
your
elders
yeah
and
that's
just
one
of
the
things
you're
going
to
have
to
deal
with
you're
immortal
she's
not
it's
not
i
married
my
edna
may
in
oughtthree
and
i
was
with
her
right
until
the
end
not
a
pretty
picture
wrinkled
and
senile
and
cursing
me
for
my
youth
wasn't
our
happiest
time
and
let's
not
forget
the
fact
that
any
moment
of
true
happiness
will
turn
you
evil
i
mean
come
on
what
kind
of
a
life
can
you
offer
her
i
don't
see
a
lot
of
sunday
picnics
in
the
offing
i
see
skulking
in
the
shadows
hiding
from
the
sun
she's
a
blossoming
young
girl
and
you
want
to
keep
her
from
the
life
she
should
have
until
it
has
passed
her
by
my
god
i
think
that's
a
little
selfish
is
that
what
you
came
back
from
hell
for
is
that
your
greater
purpose
make
the
trade
well
that
went
smooth
principal
snyder
i
think
we
have
a
problem
no
it's
i
who
should
apologize
coming
down
here
at
night
what
must
you
be
thinking
but
you
see
i
just
needed
to

no
don't
do
that
wouldn't
leave
that
open
ah
not
really
you
see
there's
about
fifty
billion
of
these
happy
little
critters
in
here
would
you
like
to
see
raise
your
hand
if
you're
invulnerable
faith
let's
go
faith
