good
to
know
i
was
kinda
feelin'
like
a
tool
and
now
i
know
why
holy
crap
oh
yes
like
how
the
cow
and
the
chicken
come
together
even
though
they've
never
met
it's
like
sleepless
in
seattle
if
if
meg
and
tom
were
like
minced
right
yyou
mentioned
that
a
couple
of
times
when
i
filled
out
the
application
well
ii
kinda
need
money
pretty
quickly
like
today
and
and
so
i
didn't
want
to
go
through
a
lengthy
interview
process
and
i
figured
this
was
probably
the
fastest
way
to
because
i

wanted
to
be
part
of
the
doublemeat
experience
hi
what
happened
uh

there's
there's
someone's
stuff
in
there
sure
they're
not
coming
back
are
they
gonna
do
something
lifers
wow
they're
all
so

identical
oh
no
not
the
employees
the
the
chicken
slices
oh
i
know
the
medley
it's
just
uh
the
video
was

kind
of
graphic
with
the
slaughter
oh
you
know
i
had
aa
big
breakfast
i'll
just
wait
for
uh

but
it
smells
so
good
mm
so
what
is
your
secret
ingredient
mmhmm
so

what's
the
deal
with
manny
the
manager
if
i
ask
him
really
nice
can
i
write
a
children's
book
called
that
fill
this
i
didn't
know
there
was
gonna
be
drug
testing
on
this
job
why
i
prefer
the
one
that
goes
'manny's
a
humorless
dolt
who
picks
the
pocket
of
heshouldbiteme'
you
hit
so
many
buttons

just
stare
into
space
