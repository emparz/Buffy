hey
no
thank
you
hey
chris
oh
i
i
was
just
wondering
what
you
were
gonna
do
this
year
'cause
every
year
you
win
and
i
place
second
so
i
just
thought
i'd
see
what
i'm
up
against
'the
tomato
fruit
or
vegetable'
okay
sure
see
you
later
chris
thanks
for
the
tip
this
shouldn't
take
long
i'm
probably
the
only
girl
in
school
who
has
the
coroner's
office
bookmarked
as
a
favorite
place
it's
a
fruit
i
found
it
meredith
todd
died
in
a
car
accident
last
week
fine
except
for
being
broken
it
says
that
meredith
and
two
other
girls
in
the
car
were
killed
instantly
they
were
all
on
the
fondren
high
pep
squad
on
the
way
to
a
game
you
mean
making
a
zombie
oh
boy
a
field
trip
are
you
gonna
call
angel
and
i'll
pack
some
food
who
else
likes
those
little
powdered
doughnuts
cordelia
jealous
of
what
because
you
did
that
sexy
dance
with
him
no
love
makes
you
do
the
wacky
daryl
epps
chris'
older
brother
he
was
a
big
football
star
allstate
two
years
ago
he
was
a
running
he
was
a
running
uh
someone
who
runs
and
catches
big
time
all
of
the
girls
were
crazy
for
him
he
died
rock
climbing
or
something
he
fell
ever
since
then
chris
has
been
real
quiet
kind
of
in
his
own
world
i
heard
their
mother
doesn't
even
leave
the
house
anymore
by
the
way
are
we
hoping
to
find
a
body
or
no
body
is
it
an
army
if
you
just
have
three
so
much
for
our
zombie
theory
they
probably
kept
the
other
parts
to
eat
well
i
can
think
of
five
or
six
guys
in
the
science
club
and
me
nothing
in
here
but
back
issues
of
scientific
american
ooo
i
haven't
read
this
one
'grey's
anatomy'
'mortician's
desk
reference'
'robicheaux's
guide
to
muscles
and
tendons'
and
for
eric
the
unattainable
would
include
everyone
that's
alive
i
dunno
that
thing
with
his
brother
was
really
hard
on
him
and
he
talked
about
death
a
lot
maybe
he
just
wanted
to
get
oneup
on
it
if
it
is
my
science
project's
definitely
coming
in
second
this
year
we
were
talking
about
the
reanimation
of
dead
tissue
i
still
don't
get
how
chris
could
do
it
i
mean
arresting
the
cell
deterioration
is
one
thing
but
maybe
an
electrical
current
combined
with
an
adrenaline
boost
maybe
they
finished
their
project
and
what
are
they
gonna
do
with
her
so
they
don't
have
the
whole
uh
package
one
step
i
checked
the
obits
nothing
that
would
make
for
a
likely
candidate
formaldehyde
after
a
couple
days
they're
useless
they're
gonna
need
something
really
fresh
as
fresh
as
possible
buffy
you
don't
think
that
they
would
buffy
don't
be
too
hard
on
chris
i
mean
he's
not
a
vampire
hi
ms
calendar
hi
giles
eric's
was
a
bust
nothing
there
did
buffy
get
back
yet
all
the
time
wondering
why
we
never
get
dates
