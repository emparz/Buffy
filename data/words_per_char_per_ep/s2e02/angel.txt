hey
is
this
a
bad
time
i
heard
you
were
on
the
hunt
when
you
first
wake
up
it's
a
little
disorienting
he'll
show
it's
weird
to
go
through
so
uh
you're
here
alone
i
just
thought
you'd
have
somebody
with
you
xander
or
someone
or
someone
of
xander
please
he's
just
a
kid
'danced
with'
is
a
pretty
loose
term
'mated
with'
might
be
a
little
closer
i
am
not
jealous
see
whenever
we
fight
you
always
bring
up
the
vampire
thing
i
didn't
see
a
stake
look
obviously
i
made
a
mistake
coming
here
tonight
you
okay
so
another
vampire
has
risen
tonight
cordelia
this
is
the
last
place
i
expected
you
to
hang
out
i
wasn't
sure
it
was
you
at
first
i'm
looking
for
buffy
she
said
she'd
be
home
you're
back
xander
i
thought
you
were
takin'
the
night
off
cordelia
told
me
the
truth
i
know
we
found
some
of
them
i
mean
like
some
of
them
like
parts
well
what
i
saw
didn't
add
up
to
three
whole
girls
i
think
they
kept
some
parts
this
was
no
hatchet
job
whoever
made
those
incisions
really
knew
what
they
were
doing
i
saw
the
fire
i
figured
you'd
be
here
is
everyone
okay
sounds
like
he
took
it
a
little
over
the
edge
what
oh
crazy
like
a
twohundredandfortyoneyearold
being
jealous
of
a
high
school
junior
i've
thought
about
it
maybe
it
bothers
me
a
little
yeah
but
he's
in
your
life
he
gets
to
be
there
when
i
can't
take
your
classes
eat
your
meals
hear
your
jokes
and
complaints
he
gets
to
see
you
in
the
sunlight
it'll
be
morning
soon
