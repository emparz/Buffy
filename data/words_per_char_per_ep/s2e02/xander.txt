hmm
it
actually
kinda
turns
me
on
so
this
chairwoman
we
are
talking
ms
calendar
right
simple
deduction
ms
calendar
is
reasonably
dollsome
especially
for
someone
in
your
age
bracket
she
already
knows
that
you're
a
school
librarian
so
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
how
to
break
that
embarrassing
news
to
her
now
is
it
time
to
have
a
talk
about
the
facts
of
life
y'know
because
that
whole
stork
thing
is
a
smoke
screen
angel
so
why
does
someone
want
to
dig
up
graves
no
drawin'
a
blank
that
fondren
might
actually
beat
sunnydale
in
the
crosstown
body
count
competition
this
year
okay
so
we
got
a
body
snatcher
what
does
that
mean
so
we
dig
up
some
graves
tonight
yeah
why
bother
him
huh
so
we're
set
then
say
nineish
byo
shovel
me
alright
but
if
you
come
across
the
army
of
zombies
can
you
page
us
before
they
eat
your
flesh
huh
yeah
i
knew
that
but
did
you
see
the
look
on
her
face
y'know
this
might
go
a
lot
faster
if
you
femmes
actually
picked
up
a
shovel
too
call
me
an
optimist
but
i'm
hoping
to
find
a
fortune
in
gold
doubloons
you're
closer
so
both
coffins
are
empty
that
makes
three
girls
signed
up
for
the
army
of
zombies
angel
that's
gotta
be
a
first
karma
so
will
come
clean
promise
to
never
do
it
again
and
we'll
call
it
a
night
he
joked
you
have
to
go
aw
too
bad
keep
in
touch
buhbye
how
about
that
i
always
pegged
him
as
a
onewoman
vampire
guys
your
friend
chris
epps'
locker
he's
into
corpses
alright
but
we
still
don't
know
why
any
sign
of
our
suspects
you
mean
when
there's
so
many
premade
ones
just
lying
around
the
things
we
do
for
love
maybe
not
but
i'll
tell
you
this
people
don't
fall
in
love
with
what's
right
in
front
of
them
people
want
the
dream
what
they
can't
have
the
more
unattainable
the
more
attractive
and
speaking
of
love
do
i
deconstruct
your
segues
best
of
luck
hello
i
wanna
get
ahead
for
the
love
of
god
can
somebody
scratch
my
nose
that's
no
coincidence
poor
girls
technically
heads
must
be
no
good
huh
i
found
'em
attractive
enough
well
obviously
i'm
not
as
sick
as
chris
and
eric
they
seem
kinda
picky
for
guys
who
had
three
heads
to
begin
with
yeah
nothing
but
a
bunch
of
computer
equipment
and
a
pornography
collection
so
prodigious
it
even
scared
me
so
what's
the
score
buffy
well
i
guess
that
makes
it
official
everybody's
paired
off
vampires
get
dates
hell
even
the
school
librarian
sees
more
action
than
me
you
ever
think
that
the
world
is
a
giant
game
of
musical
chairs
and
the
music's
stopped
and
we're
the
only
ones
who
don't
have
a
chair
do
you
mind
we're
talking
here
so
where
were
we
yeah
so
why
do
you
think
that
is
