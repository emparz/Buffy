wwwwhat
i'm
proposing
is
um
and
ii
don't
mean
to
appear
indecorous
is
is
um
a
aaa
social
engagement
um
a
a
a
aa
date
if
you're
amenable
you
idiot
iii
was
just
working
on
um
in
a
manner
of
speaking
yes
england
oh
right
wwhat
makes
you
think
that
you
know
i'm
suddenly
deciding
this
is
none
of
your
business
so
um
how
did
things
go
last
night
did
mr
korshak
show
up
on
schedule
another
vampire
grave
robbing
that's
new
interesting
yes
yes
yes
of
course
uh
terrible
thing
must
must
put
a
stop
to
it
damn
it
well
i'll
uh
collect
some
theories
uh
it
would
help
if
we
knew
who
the
body
belonged
to
why
don't
we
ask
willow
to
uh
fire
this
thing
up
and
uh
track
meredith
down
there
there
uh
hhere's
what
i've
come
up
with
demons
who
eat
the
flesh
of
the
dead
to
absorb
their
souls
or
iiit
could
obviously
be
a
a
voodoo
practitioner
uh
zombies
more
likely
for
most
traditional
purposes
a
voodoo
priest
would
require
more
than
one
xander
zombies
don't
eat
the
flesh
of
the
living
here
here
i
think
we're
there
um
body
would
mean
flesheating
demon
no
body
would
point
towards
the
uh
army
of
zombies
thing
take
your
pick
really
right
then
uh
go
on
um
as
long
as
you're
here
perhaps
you
could
be
of
some
help
hmm
hmm
so
much
for
all
our
theories
why
dispose
of
the
remains
five
miles
from
the
cemetery
at
a
school
of
all
places
oh
ah
yes
really
what
student
here
is
gonna
be
that
well
versed
in
physiology
you
understand
in
my
capacity
as
school
official
this
search
is
completely
unauthorized
and
i
i
cannot
condone
it
uh
yes
yes
of
course
nothing
remarkable
here
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
chris
is
involved
oh
yes
hello
what
oh
uh
corpses
yes
evil
huh
very
good
very
very
good
personalize
it
what
oh
don't
leave
uh
ms
calendar
jenny
then
you
know
uh
jenny
um
would
it
aappear
indecorous
uh
no
not
ininindecorous
um
well
um
wha
ah
ah
um
what
what
i'm
proposing
is
you
idiot
game
oh
uh
you're
going
to
the
football
game
no
no
iiiiii
just
assumed
that
you
you
you
spent
your
evenings
downloading
incantations
and
and
and
casting
bones
oh
of
course
always
always
do
okay
tonight
then
that
went
well
i
think
i
don't
think
we
need
to
worry
about
that
just
yet
i
spoke
to
a
press
person
this
morning
about
the
remains
the
police
have
finished
sorting
through
them
and
apparently
they
found
three
heads
in
the
dumpster
precisely
based
on
what
the
police
have
put
together
i
would
say
they're
one
step
short
of
completing
their
masterpiece
formaldehyde
yes
yes
yes
yes
of
course
it
accelerates
neural
decay
in
the
brain
cells
i
second
that
oh
i'm
supposed
to
be
at
the
big
game
ii
believe
it's
called
well
yes
but
shouldn't
i
ii
um
fine
yes
rugged
american
football
no
i
just
think
it's
rather
odd
that
a
nation
that
prides
itself
on
its
virility
should
feel
compelled
to
strap
on
forty
pounds
of
protective
gear
just
in
order
to
play
rugby
did
you
just
say
'date'
no
uh
no
uh
perhaps
you
should
uh
circulate
nearer
the
field
see
what
you
can
find
sorry
about
all
this
believe
it
or
not
since
i've
moved
here
to
live
on
top
of
the
hellmouth
the
events
of
this
evening
actually
qualify
as
a
slow
night
did
you
just
say
'second
date'
