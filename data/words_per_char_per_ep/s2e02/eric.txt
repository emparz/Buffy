for
my
private
collection

so
fine
y'know
she'd
be
just
perfect
for
us
i
guess
you'll
say

what
can
make
me
feel
this
way

my
girl

talkin'
'bout
my
girl

my
girl
how's
my
baby

not
gonna
be
anybody's
baby
if
we
don't
finish
her
soon
so
am
i
friend
so
am
i
we're
running
out
of
time
if
we
wait
too
long
the
onset
of
atrophy
in
the
limbs
will
be
irreversible
we
will
lose
the
entire
body
if
we
don't
attach
a
head
soon
we
don't
the
crash
with
the
girls
was
lucky
but
we
can't
just
keep
waiting
around
for
another
lucky
accident
to
drop
a
head
in
our
laps
you
know
what
we
have
to
do
hell
it's
just
one
lousy
girl
the
body
is
perfect
and
if
we
harvest
a
head
tonight
she'll
be
ready
by
sunrise
i
tried
to
tell
him
if
you
take
a
life
in
order
to
make
a
life
the
whole
thing
is
a
wash
no
harm
no
foul
ha
ha
a
man
of
taste
my
girl

talkin'
'bout
my
girl

girl
it's
not
too
late
nothing's
changed
we
can
still
do
this

brother's
not
the
only
one
who
can
create
life
whadaya

let's
go
scare
you
up
a
date

it's
bad
luck
for
the
groom
to
see
the
bride
before
the
wedding
you
can
scream
all
you
want
we're
in
an
abandoned
building
okay

enough
we're
ready
you're
gonna
feel
a
little
pinch
maybe
some
discomfort
around
the
neck
area
but
don't
worry
when
you
wake
up
you'll
have
the
body
of
a
seventeenyearold
in
fact
you'll
have
the
body
of
several
sterile

for
government
work
