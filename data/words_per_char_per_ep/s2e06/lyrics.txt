i
don't
say
much
but
i
but
i
like
to
sing
won't
tell
you
what
i'm
thinking
just
have
to
wait
and
sing
i
have
no
skin
left
on
my
on
my
fingertips
but
still
my
heart
pours
out
out
from
my
lips
well
i'm
mute
but
i'm
not
quite
mute
and
i
say
the
things
you
want
to
hear
i'm
mute
but
i'm
not
quite
mute
and
i
keep
to
myself
to
defend
yeah
i'm
alright
oh
now
don't
want
to
fight
i'm
an
angel
burning
out

oh
now
