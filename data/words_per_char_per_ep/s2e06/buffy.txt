hi
i'm
rough
day
at
the
office
hey
it's
a
look
a
seasonal
look
know
what
i
need
to
go
put
a
bag
over
my
head
you're
sweet
a
terrible
liar
but
sweet
a
date
so
did
i
but
who
am
i
kidding
dates
are
things
normal
girls
have
girls
who
have
time
to
think
about
nail
polish
and
facials
you
know
what
i
think
about
ambush
tactics
beheading
not
exactly
the
stuff
dreams
are
made
of
what's
the
deal
yikes
i'll
stick
to
vampires
principal
snyder
gosh
i'd
love
to
sign
up
but
i
recently
developed
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
and
can
tragically
no
longer
hold
a
flashlight
great
i
was
gonna
stay
in
and
veg
the
one
night
a
year
things
are
supposed
to
be
quiet
for
me
not
according
to
giles
he
swears
that
tomorrow
night
is
like
dead
for
the
undead
they
stay
in
get
gone
ooo
diet
saved
you
a
dollar
oh
that
forget
about
it
xander
don't
you
think
you're
i
think
i
just
violated
the
guy
code
big
time
misfire
i
was
late
due
to
unscheduled
slayage
showed
up
looking
trashed
actually
he
was
pretty
unmad
which
probably
had
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
cordelia
was
drooling
in
his
cappuccino
you
mean
that
'actually
showing
up
wearing
a
stunning
outfit
embracing
personal
hygiene'
act
are
you
sure
i
mean
i
don't
know
what
his
type
is
i've
known
him
less
than
a
year
and
if
you
haven't
noticed
he's
not
exactly
one
to
over
share
yeah
it's
too
bad
that
stuff
is
private
most
importantly
it
would
be
wrong
nothing
hi
you're
beginning
to
scare
me
giles
you
need
to
have
some
fun
you
know
there's
this
place
you
can
go
right
and
you
sit
in
the
dark
and
there
are
these
moving
pictures
right
and
the
pictures
tell
a
story
such
as
do
you
stuff
your
own
shirts
or
do
you
send
them
out
so
how
come
halloween
is
such
a
big
yawner
i
mean
do
the
demons
just
hate
how
commercial
it's
become
of
course
it's
of
interest
to
me
i'm
the
slayer
i
need
to
know
these
things
you
can't
keep
me
in
the
dark
any
longer
look
at
me
when
i
talk
to
you
ms
calendar
said
you
were
a
babe
well
she
said
that
you
were
a
hhunk
of
burning
something
or
other
so
whadaya
think
of
that
look
you
know
how
disgusting
it
is
for
me
to
even
contemplate
you
grownups
having
smoochies
but
i
think
you
should
go
for
it
but
i've
overstepped
my
bounds
it's
none
of
my
business
you
know
what
was
i
thinking
my
god
shame
shame
i
gotta
go
man
look
at
her
it
doesn't
say
but
the
entry's
dated
1775
so
that's
the
kinda
girl
he
hung
around
she's
pretty
coiffed
and
clearly
this
girl
was
a
workaholic
i'll
never
be
like
this
thank
you
now
i
feel
better
musta
been
wonderful
put
on
some
fantabulous
gown
and
go
to
a
ball
like
a
princess
and
have
horses
and
servants
and
yet
more
gowns
i'll
bet
cordelia
i
think
his
parents
have
been
dead
for
a
couple
of
