i
know
is
the
bronze
so
not
happening
or
what
hi
great
i'm
supposed
to
be
meeting
devon
but
he's
nowhere
to
be
seen
it's
like
he
thinks
being
in
a
band
gives
him
an
obligation
to
flake
well
his
loss
is
your
incredible
gain
so
i
told
devon
'you
call
that
leather
interior
my
barbie
dream
car
had
nicer
seats'
buffy
love
the
hair
it
just
screams
street
urchin
cappuccino
so
buffy
you
ran
off
last
night
and
left
poor
little
angel
all
by
his
lonesome
but
i
did
everything
i
could
to
comfort
him
so
what's
his
story
anyway
i
mean
i
never
see
him
around
oh
please
don't
tell
me
he
still
lives
at
home
like
he
has
to
wait
for
his
dad
to
get
back
before
he
can
take
the
car
oh
good
i
mean
oh
he's
a
vampire
of
course
but
the
cuddly
kind
like
a
carebear
with
fangs
you
know
what
i
think
i
just
think
you're
trying
to
scare
me
off
'cause
you're
afraid
of
the
competition
look
buffy
you
may
be
hot
stuff

it
comes
to
demonology
