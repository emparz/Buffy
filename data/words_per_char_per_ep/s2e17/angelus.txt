all
ye
who

knowledge'
angelus

the
local
boogedyboogedy

orb
of
thesulah
if

serves
this
is
supposed
to
summon
a
person's
soul
from
the
ether
store
it
until
it
can
be
transferred
you
know
what
i
hate
most
about
these
things
they're
so
damn
fragile
must
be
that
shoddy
gypsy
craftsmanship
huh
i
never
cease
to
be
amazed
how
much
the
world
has
changed
in
just
two
and
a
half
centuries
it's
a
miracle
to
me
you
you
put
the
secrets
to
restoring
my
soul
in
here
it
comes
out
here
'the
ritual
of
restoration'
wow
this
this
brings
back
memories
oh
my
cure
no
thanks
been
there
done
that
and
deja
vu
just
isn't
what
it
used
to
be
my
isn't
this
my
lucky
day
the
computer
and
the
pages
looks
like
i
get
to
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
and
teacher
makes
three
oh
good
i
need
to
work
up
an
appetite
first
sorry
jenny
this
is
where
you
get
off
ah
i
never
get
tired
of
doing
that
passion
is
the
source
of
our
finest
moments
the
joy
of
love
the
clarity
of
hatred
and
the
ecstasy
of
grief
don't
worry
roller
boy
i've
got
everything
under
control
jeez
whatever
happened
to
wooden
stakes
all
right
you've
had
your
fun
but
you
know
what
it's
time
for
now
are
you
gonna
let
your
old
man
just
burn
it
hurts
sometimes
more
than
we
can
bear
if
we
could
live
without
passion
maybe
we'd
know
some
kind
of
peace
but
we
would
be
hollow
empty
rooms
shuttered
and
dank
without
passion
we'd
be
truly
dead
