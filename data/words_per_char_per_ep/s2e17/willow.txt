yes
really
me
teach
the
class
sure
oh
wait
wwhat
if
they
don't
recognize
my
authority
what
if
they
try
to
convince
me
that
you
always
let
them
leave
class
early
what
if
there's
a
fire
drill
what
if
there's
a
fire
okay
good
earlier
is
good
will
i
have
the
power
to
assign
detention
or
make
'em
run
laps
sorry
i
have
to
talk
to
her
she's
a
teacher
and
teachers
are
to
be
respected
even
if
they're
only
filling
in
until
the
real
teacher
shows
up
because
otherwise
chaos
could
ensue
i
agree
with
giles
you
need
to
just
try
and
not
let
him
get
to
you
angel's
only
doing
this
to
try
to
get
you
to
do
something
stupid
i
swear
men
can
be
such
jerks
sometimes
dead
or
alive
i'm
sure
he
will
he's
like
bookman

for
having
me
over
buffy

on
a
school
night
and

okay
we
hadn't
really
had
time
to
bond
yet
although
for
the
first
time
i'm
glad
my
parents
didn't
let
me
have
a
puppy
well
sort
of
except
you're
still
the
only
thing
he
thinks
about
we
had
kind
of
a
'pajama
party
sleepover
with
weapons'
thing
i
have
to
go
i
have
a
class
to
teach
in
about
five
minutes

have
to
arrive
early

glare
disapprovingly
at
the
stragglers

my
dad

her
bedroom
wall
i
have
to
go
over
to
xander's
house
just
to
watch
'a
charlie
brown
christmas'

year
although
it
is
worthwhile
to
see
him
do
the
snoopy
dance

for
you
'hicce
verbis
consensus
rescissus
est'
translation
by
these
strong
unanimous
words

rescinded

i
just
realized
that

been
proud
of
her
though
she
totally
kept
her
cool
