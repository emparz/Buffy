think
i
slip
the
net

but
i
cut
myself
free
cut
to
the
crowd
below
buffy
and
xander
are
dancing
together
but
not
close
and
exchange
a
few
words
as
they
move
around
behind
them
cordelia
and
willow
are
sitting
at
a
table
and
chatting
i'm
not
losing
yet

so
don't
forget
me

i'll
say
it
replay
it
and
try
tomorrow
angelus
it
lies
in
all
of
us
i'll
say
it
replay
it
and
live
with
sorrow
angelus
waiting
and
though
unwanted
you'd
think
i'd
learn
by
now
angelus
unbidden
it
will
stir
there's
never
an
easy
way
he
begins
to
move
around
the
room
all
the
while
keeping
his
stare
on
buffy
i'll
get
through
somehow

i'm
on
my
knees
to
pray
cut
outside
to
the
alley
willow
and
buffy
come
walking
out
of
the
bronze
buffy
has
her
arm
hooked
into
willow's
cordelia
and
xander
are
behind
them
with
their
arms
around
each
other
you'd
think
i'd
learn
by
now

there's
never
an
easy
way
they
walk
past
a
couple
apparently
engaged
in
a
kiss
the
camera
stops
on
the
couple
i'll
get
through
somehow
