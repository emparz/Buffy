ah
it's
a
fair
cop
you
caught
me
slayer
however
in
all
honesty
i
think
we
have
to
say
this
one
doesn't
count
after
all
i
wasn't
exactly
hiding
no
what
kind
of
answer
is
that
you
haven't
even
heard
the
question
yet
and
we
both
know

that
i'm
not
the
only
one
thinking
it
why
not
so
it's
the
fear
of
getting
caught
then
is
it
needn't
be
an
obstacle
i
hear
you're
serious
so
am
i
i
want
you

you
want
me
i
can't
go
inside
so

maybe
the
time
is
right

for
you
to
come
outside
buffy
hey
now
if
i'da
known
you
were
coming
i'da
baked
a
cake
well
suppose
i
could
be
helpful
if
the
price
is
right
i'm
not
sure
i'm
selling
out
at
double
meat
palace
wages
though
human
clock
ticking
soon
but
not
now
i
love
you
you
know
i
do
i
always
want
you
in
point
of
fact
well
looky
here
i
don't
usually
use
the
word
delicious
but
i've
gotta
wager
this
little
tableau
must
sting
a
bit
eh
me
and
your
former
must
kill
what
can
i
say
girl
just
needs
a
little
monster
in
her
man
here
i
thought
we'd
run
you
out
of
town
mate
last
time
i
saw
you
if
memory
serves
you
were
getting
the
juice
sucked
out
of
you
by
some
undead
ladies
of
very
questionable
reputation
now
be
a
good
tin
soldier
and
uh
where
are
what
and
why
do
you
keep
calling
me
that
look
crew
cut
she's
not
your
bint
any
more
and
if
i
can
speak
frankly
she
always
had
a
little
thing
for
me
even
when
she
was
shagging
you
eggs
you're
off
your
nut
it
must
be
those
drugs
they
were
keeping
you
on
i
did
warn
you
no
need
to
defend
me
luv
over
my
dead
body
well
you're
not
gonna
oh
this
is

unconstitutional
is
what
it
is
here
there's
nothin'
to
see
down
there
i
can
explain
you
can
stop
calling
me
that
any
time
if
i
may
the
thing
of
it
is
i'm
holding
these
for
a
friend
who
well
that's
bloody
funny
coming
from
you
no
more
games
that's
all
you've
ever
done
is
play
me
you
keep
playing
with
rules
you
make
up
as
you
like
you
know
what
i
am
you've
always
known
you
come
to
me
all
the
same
so
she's
back
thought
you'd
be
off
snogging
with
soldierboy
so
you
come
for
a
bit
of
cold
comfort
the
bed's
a
bit
blown
up
but
then
that
was
never
our
so
this
is
worse
then
is
it
this
is
you
telling
me
i've
memorized
this
tune
luv
think
i
have
the
sheet
music
doesn't
change
what
you
want
i
don't
call
five
hours
straight
a
little
while
really
not
complaining
here
