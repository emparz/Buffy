pleasure
mine
oh
honey

that's
okay
let
me
guess
captain
cando
over
here
forgot
to
mention
that
this
was
a
homing
operation
but
it's
nice
to
finally
meet
you
by
the
way
knife
damn
we're
too
late
finn

how
could
you
recruit
the
slayer
without
filling
her
in
on
the
objective
if
we
weren't
under
severe
time
constraints
i'd
seriously
think
about
ripping
you
a
new
one
oh
he
wishes
we
better
regroup
buffy
i
hate
to
impose
further
but

you
got
a
safe
house
hi
yeah
three
months
old
and
growing
fast
yeah
just
follow
the
villages
with
nothing
in
them
but
body
parts
oh
come
on
finn
she
looks
all
grownup
to
me
that
is
if
it's
all
right
with
you
no
it
came
here
to
the
hellmouth
to
to
spawn
but
we
think
it
already
hatched
its
eggs
somewhere
unless
we
stop
it
buffy
it's
good
that
you
killed
the
suvolte
before
it
killed
us
disposable
cameras
yeah
you
you
know
little
plastic
ones
ten
bucks
a
pop
you
arrange
them
like
table
settings
guests
snap
photos
breaks
the
ice
and
when
the
wedding's
over
you
get
to
take
home
the
pictures
we
think
they're
gonna
be
sold
on
the
black
market
there
are
some
foreign
military
powers
that
would
love
to
have
their
own
suvolte
you
could
never
train
it
but
drop
it
on
an
urban
population
lots
of
'em
money's
been
exchanged
there's
a
dealer
in
town
calls
himself
the
the
doctor
willow
you
think
you
can
help
with
a
little
locating
spell
oh
riley
says
you're
comin'
on
as
one
majorleague
wicca
you
know
i
don't
wanna
be
dragging
down
the
slayer
you've
got
speed
and
power
i
can't
even
hey
willow
i'm
sorry
i
think
i
really

stepped
in
it
in
there
you
know
back
in
the
jungle

we
had
not
one
but
two
hardcore
shamans
working
for
us

they
were
working
the
dark
magicks
and

got
addicted
and
now
they're
gone
gone

as
in

there's
nothing
left
i've
never
met
anyone
with
enough
strength
to
quit
before
i'm
just
saying
maybe
not
for
you
i
gotta
tell
you
buffy
i'm
a
little
bit
intimidated
i
mean
patrolling
with
the
real
live
slayer
you're
like

santa
claus
or
buddha
or
something
legendary
and
it's
not
just
slayer
status
i'm
talking
about
it's
you
he
didn't
say
anything
for
a
long
time
but
i
could
tell
he
was
ripped
up
inside
more
like
miraculous
i
went
down
to
central
america
with
the
peace
corps
one
night
my
entire
infirmary
got
slaughtered
by
i
didn't
know
what
they
were
i
got
saved
quit
the
corps
joined
the
squad
my
first
firefight
i
met
riley
we
started
talking
you
know
first
about
tactics
missions
stuff
like
that
and
then
about
you
do
you
wish
you
hadn't
i
didn't
mean
to
put
you
on
the
spot
buffy
there's
no
bad
guys
in
this
one
the
only
thing
that
could

help
riley
work
it
out
was
time
lots
of
time
took
him
a
year
to
get
over
you
so
you
seeing
anyone
new
someone
special
yeah
better
no
guy
than
the
wrong
guy
