incredible
patheticness
softened
the
blow
for
you

kinda
love
her
too
no
riley
that
night
i
never
got
the
chance

to
tell
you

how
sorry
i
was
about
what
happened
between
us
he's
gone
i'm
not
here
to
and
i'm
not
here
to
bust
your
chops
about
your
stupid
scheme
either
that's
just
you
i
should
have
remembered
it's
over
i
know
that
i
do
want
you
being
with
you

makes
things

simpler
for
a
little
while
i'm
using
you
i
can't
love
you
i'm
just

being
weak
and
selfish
and
it's
killing
me
i
have
to
be
strong
about
this
i'm
sorry
