the
seating
chart's
fine
let's
get
back
to
the
table
arrangements
i'm
starting
to
have
dreams
of
gardenia
bouquets
i
am
so
glad
my
manly
coworkers
didn't
just
hear
me
say
that
yeah
wedding
one
week
we
have
friends
family
demons
flying
in
a
todo
list
getting
no
shorter
and
do
not
take
my
chips
the
radio
said
no
traffic
it
just
gives
my
uncle
rory
more
time
at
the
bar
trust
me
he'll
be
happy
he
can't
afford
a
hotel
i'm
not
i
hate
my
uncle
i
hate
my
whole
family
that's
why
i'm
marrying
you
to
start
a
new
family
have
children
make
them
hate
us
then
one
day
they'll
get
married
we'll
sleep
on
their
couch
it's
the
circle
of
life
why
did
we
ever
agree
to
have
your
friends
who
are
demons
and
my
family
who
are
monsters
stay
at
our
place
without
the
laughs
we
should
have
eloped
mm
cool
ranch
hey
there's
the
man
life
taker
heartbreaker
you
know
figuratively
speaking
we're
here
to
help
just
like
old
times
except
with
you
being
all
big
with
the
married
life
okay
so
we
track
down
the
demon
find
the
nest
mr
and
mrs
finn
here
make
with
the
killin'
and
everyone
goes
home
happy
but
seriously
married
man
if
forced
to
choose
between
a
photographer
and
place
settings
buffy
we
can't
track
the
demon
i
killed
it
so
who's
hungry
we
got
uh
dawn
ice
cubes
di

wah
i
like
it
yeah
he's
taken
and
that's
not
the
point
no
but
granted
i
have
a
hard
time
imagining
nick
and
nora
fury
hiding
out
from
their
own
relatives
in
the
bathroom
and
i
have
no
idea
what
riley
and
mrs
riley's
wedding
was
like
well
they
have
a
great
marriage
and
it
bummed
buffy
out
but
i
can
see
it
and
anya

i
really
have
no
clue
what
their
wedding
was
like
separate
things
one
fills
me
with
a
dread
akin
to
public
speaking
engagements
which
will
be
over
soon
that
lasts
forever
huh
and
just
curious
what's
a
chopper
rental
run
these
days
oh
bye
bye
riley
bye
sam
