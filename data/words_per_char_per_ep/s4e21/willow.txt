i
forgot
my
laptop
and
the
disks
no
that's
okay
got
'em
sosee
ya
ok
bye
can't
not
now
ii
think
i'm
on
to
something
i've
been
assuming
thethe
ciphertext
was
encrypted
with
an
asymmetric
algorithm
then
it
hit
me
a
hexogonic
key
pattern
it's
i
didn't
i
haven't
even
finished
typing
in
the
new
code
must
be
programmed
to
selfdecrypt
to
a
certain
point
that
is
so
annoying
it's
like
someone
blurting
out
the
answer
to
a
riddle
just
when
you'vei
mean
yippee
we
have
the
information
and
i
don't
think
tara
felt
welcome
well
umspike
specifically
but
me
too
sowhy
do
you
think
spike
made
with
the
head
games
oh
i
decrypted
them
well
they
decrypted
themselves
but
i
almost
had
it
a
bunch
of
stuff
we
already
know
about
314
but
it
also
said
there's
some
final
phase
where
adam
manufactures
a
bunch
of
creepy
cyberdemonoids
like
him
there's
a
special
lab
in
the
initiative
but
it
didn't
say
where
hidden
somewhere
what
do
you
mean
and
adam
has
a
neat
pile
of
body
parts
to
start
assembling
his
army
diabolical
yet
gross
riley
what
about
magic
some
kind
of
i
don't
knowuranium
extracting
spell
i
know
i'm
reaching
right
don't
you
have
to
speak
it
in
sumerian
or
something
nervous
the
adjoining
spell
is
it
powerful
enough
to
defeat
adam
super
what
was
i
thinkin'
using
stairs
all
this
time
it's
not
your
fault
spike
stirred
up
trouble
maybe
a
little
but
you
know
first
year
of
college

hard
to
keep
the
old
high
school
gang

the
slayer
buffy

stuff

pretty
crucial

haven't
been
miss

to
this
there's
air

and
electrical
conduits
all
running
into
there
so
there's
no
