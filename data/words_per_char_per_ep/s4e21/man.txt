it
was
an
experiment
the
initiative
represented
the
government's
interests
in
not
only
controlling
the
otherworldly
menace
but
harnessing
its
power
for
our
own
military
purposes
the
considered
opinion
of
this
counsel
is
that
this
experiment
has
failed
it
is
therefore
our
recommendation
that
this
project
be
terminated
and
all
records
concerning
it
expunged
our
soldiers'll
be
debriefed
standard
confidentiality
clause
we
will
monitor
the
civilians
and
usual
measures
prepared
should
they
try
to
go
public
i
don't
think
they
will
the
initiative
itself
will
be
filled
in
with
concrete
burn
it
down
gentlemen
burn
it
down
and
salt
the
earth
