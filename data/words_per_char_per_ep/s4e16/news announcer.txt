and
barricaded
themselves
in
the
church
with
at
least
20
parishioners
one
of
the
few
who
escaped
described
the
three
men
as
frighteningly
disfigured
almost
inhuman
so
far
one
escapee
has
since
died
of
severe
neck
wounds
there
is
no
report
on
the
condition
of
the
parishioners
still
trapped
inside
but
their
assailants
have
vowed
to
kill
all
of
them
if
police
attempt
to
storm
the
church
