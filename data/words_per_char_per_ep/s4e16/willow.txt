i
wonder
where
she
is
yeah
i
wish
she
would
make
a
move
she's
making
my
stomach
all
acidy
i
think
so
but
that
doesn't
mean
faith
won't
hurt
someone
else
hey
tara
it's
not
like
i
don't
want
my
friends
to
know
you
it's
just
well
buffy's
like
my
best
friend
and
she's
really
special
and
there's
this
whole
bunch
of
us
and
we
sort
of
have
this
group
thing
that
revolves
around
the
slaying
andand
i
i
really
want
you
to
meet
them
but
i
kind
of
like
having
something
that's
just
you
know
mine
and
ii
usually
don't
use
so
many
words
to
say
stuff
that
little
but
do
you
get
it
at
all
i
should
check
in
with
giles
get
a
situation
update
what
where
is
she
what's
wetworks
yeah
i
hope
they
throw
the
book
at
her
they
could
throw
other
things
after
what
she's
done
to
you
oh
i
wish
those
council
guys
would
let
me
have
an
hour
alone
in
the
room
with
her
if
i
was
larger
and
had
grenades
what's
up
i
know
i
can't
believe
you've
never
been
here
the
bronze
is
the
coolest
place
in
sunnydale
ofof
course
there's
not
a
lot
of
competition
i
think
the
vending
machine
at
bergen's
came
in
second
buffy
wow
ii
didn't
think
she'd
be
here
come
on
i
want
you
to
meet
her
hey
buffy
tara
was
in
my
wicca
group
so
what's
up
patrol
a
nogo
good
for
you
you
shouldn't
work
yourself
too
hard
anyone
want
a
soda
buffy
guy
in
the
corner
vampire
you
want
help
everything
poofed
tara's
not
feeling
well
i'm
gonna
walk
her
home
are
you
gonna
be
in
later
or
you
going
over
to
riley's
i'm
sorry
you're
feeling
all
blechy
but
we'll
get
together
with
buffy
another
time
sometime
soon
i
think
you'll
really
like
her
i
may
have
overestimated
the
you
liking
her
factor
you
lost
me
so
you
think
buffy's
not
herself
like
she's
been
possessed
or
something
you
didn't
sense
a
hyena
energy
at
all
did
you
because
hyena
possession
is
justunpleasant
of
buffy's
uhhhh
oh
this
ring
if
it'll
help
her
what
i
trust
you
i
trust
you
giles
oh
my
god
you're
buffy
you
and
faith
switched
bodies
probably
through
a
draconian
katra
spell
tara
tara
this
is
buffy
only
really
this
time
tara's
a
really
powerful
witch
no
really
she
knew
right
away
that
you
weren't
you
so
we
connected
with
the
nether
realms
to
find
out
what
happened
and
we
conjured
this
it's
a
katra
or
the
homeconjured
version
itit
should
switch
you
back
if
you
can
get
a
hold
of
faith
we've
gotta
get
inside
but
we
can't
we've
gotta
y
you
don't
understand
