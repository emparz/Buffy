it
was
too
crowded
we
gotta
hold
out
for
a
few
hours
pick
up
a
straggler
some
drunk
can't
be
calling
attention
to
ourselves
this
is
my
place
kill
this
guy
already
you
can
have
the
place
i
mean
we
don't
have
to
stay
here
anymore
ok
we're
a
paradox
that's
cool
tell
us
what
to
do
we're
ready
it's
hard
to
believe
i've
been
avoiding
this
place
for
so
many
years
and
it's
nothing
it's
nice
it's
got
the
pretty
windows
the
pillars
lots
of
folks
to
eat
where's
the
thing
i
was
so
afraid
of
you
know
the
lord
he
was
supposed
to
be
here
he
gave
us
this
address
well
we'll
just
have
to
start
killing
off
his
people
see
if
he
shows
up
i
told
the
cops
they
send
anyone
in
i
start
the
whole
massacre
thing
now's
a
good
time
to
start
why
not
you're
the
slayer
you
think
we're
afraid
of
you
we're
not
afraid
of
anything
anymore
heh
i
got
a
better
idea
i
have
strength
you
couldn't
dream
of
adam
has
shown
me
the
way
and
there
is
nothing
aaaaahhhhhh
