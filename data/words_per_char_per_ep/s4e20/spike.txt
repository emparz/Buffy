cast
an
eye
to
the
front
door
every
now

i
left
one
buffy
around
i
need
to
speak
to
the
lady
of
the
house

a
pet
and
give
her
a
message
for
me
would
you
tell
her
i
just
might
have
something
she
just
might
want
information
highly
classified
not
cheap
wordonthestreet
prattle
either
i'm
talking
about
the
good
stuff
now
it's
nothing
i
know
what
you
think
i'd
come
running
over
saying
i've
got
a
secret
beat
me
till
i
talk
there's
files
in
the
initiative
i'm
pretty
sure
i
know
where
yeah
secrets
mission
statements
design
schematics
all
of
maggie
walsh's
dirty
laundry
which
i
guess
would
include
lots
of
tidbits
about
well
yeah
say
someone
were
to
risk
his
life
and
limb
well
limb
anyway
to
obtain
said
files
it
might
be
worth
a
little
something
that
person'd
be
right
rupert
supply
and
demand
and
it
won't
be
cheap
this
time
hmm
year
supply
of
blood
guaranteed
protection
merry
bushels
of
cash
and
most
important
a
guarantee
that
i'm
not
to
be
in
anyway
slain
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
from
you
sorry
not
close
to
good
enough
this
deal's
with
the
slayer
oh
you'll
tell
her
great
comfort
that
what
makes
you
think
she'll
listen
to
you
very
convincing
i
think
you're
neglecting
the
pasttense
there
rupert
besides
she
barely
listened
to
you
when
you
were
in
charge
i've
seen
the
way
she
treats
you
very
much
like
a
retired
librarian
look
i've
got
what
she
wants
as
long
as
she
has
what
i
want
spread
the
word
she
knows
where
to
find
me
hello
this
is
just
swell
gotta
say
liking
this
quite
a
lot
kinda
changes
the
balances
of
powoww
akk
oh
come
on
you
got
to
be
kidding
it
doesn't
work
what
about
selfdefense
i'm
taking
a
risk
here
you
know
attitude
see
how
far
that'll
take
you
in
boot
camp
say
i
hope
you
get
one
of
those
toughsasnails
drill
sergeants
who's
only
hard
on
the
men
because
he's
trying
to
keep
them
alive
when
the
bullets
start
flying
i
love
that
stuff
what
you
changed
your
mind
not
gonna
join
oh
your
girliemates
were
talking
something
about
uh
being
all
you
can
be
or
all
you
can
be
and
having
a
laugh
figured
you
were
signing
up
say
have
you
got
anything
larger
in
the
toy
gun
line
terrific
you
didn't
have
these
cleaned
after
the
last
time
did
you
hey
it
was
just
a
laugh
there's
no
need
to
go
insane
over
it
sir
no
sir
i
think
i
lost
the
buggers
took
what
they
had
should
be
something
useful
on
one
of
them
no
i
mean
a
couple
of
them
made
me
on
the
way
out
but
i
took
care
of
'em
well
yeah
when
do
i
get
paid
i
could've
gone
straight
to
the
slayer
you
know
i
cut
you
in
let
you
pretend
you're
actually
in
charge
now
you've
got
to
wait
for
red's
permission
to
finish
the
deal
gibberish
can
you
fix
'em
you're
not
exactly
the
whiz
these
days
either
god
i'm
never
gonna
get
paid
no
i
just
heard
you
weren't
your
mates
said
you
weren't
playing
with
computers
so
much
into
the
new
thing
you
know
you
two
the
whole
wicca
thing
can
we
get
back
to
business
here
i've
got
a
deal
at
stake
talking
about
you
know
it's
a
phase
you'll
get
over
it
no
she
was
defending
you
'cause
xander
said
you
were
just
being
trendy
i
don't
know
what
they
were
going
on
about
a
person
wants
be
a
witch
that's
their
business
pressing
business
ladies
don't
want
to
get
sidetracked
still
got
your
monsters
to
fight
now
that
was
fun
easier
than
i'd
thought
it'd
be
too
feel
it
in
my
bones
it's
uh
called
the
yoko
factor
don't
tell
me
you've
never
heard
of
the
beatles
what
a
surprise
the
point
is
they
were
once
a
real
powerful
group
it's
not
a
stretch
to
say
they
ruled
the
world
and
when
they
broke
up
everyone
blamed
yoko
but
the
fact
is
the
group
split
itself
apart
she
just
happened
to
be
there
and
you
know
how
it
is
with
kids
they
go
off
to
college
they
grow
apart
way
of
the
world
well
since
we've
got
all
our
ducks
in
a
row
and
not
talking
to
each
other
guess
it's
time
for
the
grand
plan
huh
you
know
the
one
where
i
get
the
chipectomy
you
got
everything
you
need
right
