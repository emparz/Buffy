stratagems
i'm
very
help
me
out
this
is
so
like
them
lately
it's
all
about
them
and
the
college
life
well
you

what
college
is
it's
high
school
only
without
the
actual
going
to

well
high
school
was
kinda
like
that
too
but
the
point
is
i'm
out
there
working
hard
to
make
a
living
it's
nothing
but
a
huge
joke
to
them
xander
got
fired
from
starbucks
xander
got
fired
from
that
phonesex
line
and
they
hate
you
is
anybody
talking
to
you
so
she
doesn't
go
alone
giles
weapons
all
around
oh
okay
you
and
willow
go
do
the
superpower
thing
i'll
stay
behind
and
putt

the
batcave
with
crusty
old
alfred
here

other
ways
want
some
fighting
pants
buff
i
can
get
ya
some
new
fighting
pants
right
i'm
so
good
at
it
you
might
have
to
ship
me
off
to
the
army
to
get
me
out
of
the
way
you
didn't
think
i
knew
about
that
did
you
you
two
talking
about
me
behind
my
back
uhhuh
but
maybe
that
all
changes
when
i'm
doing
situps
over
at
fort
dix
stupid
so
you
finally
have
the
guts
to
say
it
to
my
face
and
if
i
did
join
the
army
i'd
be
great
you
know
why
'cause
they
might
give
me
a
job
that
couldn't
be
done
by
any
welltrained
border
collie
i
knew
it
i
knew
you
hated
her
oh
and
superior
don't
forget
that
just
because
you're
better
than
us
doesn't
mean
that
you
can
be
all
superior
no
it
was
bad
before
that
since
you
two
went
off
to
college
and
forgot
about
me
just
left
me
in
the
basement
to
tara's
your
girlfriend
really
not
wanted
buffy
