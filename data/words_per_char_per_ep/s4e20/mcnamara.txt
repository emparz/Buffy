these
are
exceptional
boys
their
capture
ratio
just
keeps
increasing
they're
keeping
it
together
morale's
a
problem
the
death
of
professor
walsh
the
escape
of
the
prototype
controlling
the
hsts
is
getting
harder
we
have
serious
overcrowding
in
the
containment
areas
as
he
spoke
the
camera
has
slowly
panned
away
from
the
monitor
to
the
colonel
we
can
see
he
is
standing
in
some
kind
of
communications
center
in
the
initiative
there
is
a
large
world
map
on
one
wall
he
is
the
only
one
there
it's
not
my
mess
sir
i'm
just
holding
the
fort
while
you
figure
out
what
you
want
to
do
with
the
place
fell
in
with
a
bad
crowd
quite
frankly
i
don't
think
he
was
ever
the
soldier
that
you
all
hoped
he
was
boy
thinks
too
much
we'll
catch
up
to
him
my
feeling
is
he
won't
stray
too
far
from
the
girl
she's
just
a
girl
they're
animals
lieutenant
we
pack
them
in
until
we're
out
of
room
and
then
we
pack
them
in
some
more
i
have
no
problem
with
that
scenario
as
they
reach
the
other
side
of
the
containment
area
we
see
two
demons
in
the
last
cell
fighting
their
claws
at
each
other's
throat
