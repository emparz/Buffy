let's
lay
her
out
how
long's
she
been
like
this
was
she
conscious
we're
gonna
intubate
just
trying
to
get
her
to
breathe
all
right
this
your
mother
she
have
any
serious
physical
health
problems
any
history
of
heart
disease
let's
get
her
on
the
truck
now
i'm
calling
ahead
she's
cold
man
call
it
i'm
sorry
i'm
sorry
but
i
have
to
tell
you
that
your
mother's
dead
it
looks
like
she
did
die
a
good
while
before
you
found
her
there's

nothing
you
could
have
done
i'm
guessing
it
must
have
been
a
aneurysm
or
some
clotting
some
complication
from
surgery
she
probably
felt
very
little
pain
i'm
gonna
call
it
in
the
coroner's
office
will
come
by
and
take
her
in
and
they'll
determine
the
cause
of
death
conclusively
all
right
i'm
gonna
call
this
right
away
now
the
coroner's
office
may
take
a
while
in
the
meanwhile
i
think
you
should
sit
have
a
glass
of
water
and
try
not
to
disturb
the
body
do
you
need
anything
is
there
someone
you
can
call
i'm
very
sorry
for
your
loss
