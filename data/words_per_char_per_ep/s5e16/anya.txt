disemboweled
children
but
otherwise
you're
doubleparked
so

and
i
thought

never
have
any
more
fruit
punch
ever
and
she'll
never
have
eggs
or
yawn
or
brush
her
hair
not
ever
and
no
one
will
explain
to
me
why
my
god
is
your
hand
okay
you
could
have
hit
an
electrical
thing
xander
decided
that
he
blames
the
wall
bandaids
how
are
we
going
to
help
i
wish
that
joyce
didn't
die
because
she
was
nice
and
now
we
all
hurt
the
sandwiches
are
meat
