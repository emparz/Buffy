we
have
to
keep
moving
just
one
truckglory
looks
to
her
right
too
late
as
a
huge
semi
smashes
into
her
i
don't
know
how
we
got
away
that
truck
couldn't
have
slowed
her
down
for
more
than
a
second
safe
we've
barely
been
able
to
manage
not
getting
seriously
dead
every
time
we've
crossed
paths
with
glory
now
that
she
knows
that
dawn
is
the
key
well
we
can't
stay
here
she'll
just
kill
us
off
one
by
one
until
there's
no
one
left
standing
between
her
and
dawn
no
we
stay
we
die
show
of
hands
for
that
option
all
right
nobody
goes
home
nobody
tells
anybody
we're
leaving
just
pack
up
whatever
supplies
we
need
and
that's
it
we're
gone
just
get
your
stuff
together
i'll
handle
the
rest
he's
here
because
we
need
him
if
glory
finds
us
he's
the
only
one
besides
me
that
has
any
chance
of
protecting
dawn
maybe
later
for
what
yeah
i'm
doin'
a
great
job
i'm
the
slayer
the
chosen
one
all
mythic
and
defendery
evil
nasties
are
supposed
to
flee
from
me
not
the
other
way
around
quaintly
referred
to
in
some
cultures
as
the
big
scaredy
runaway
it
just
keeps
coming
glory

riley

tara

mom

is
you
know
this
is
your
fault
for
saying
that
giles
dawn
get
down
under
the
table

won't
aim
for
the
horsies
stay
low
watch
out
for
the
the
sword
point
comes
in
directly
at
buffy's
head
spike
reaches
up
with
both
hands
and
grabs
the
sword
stops
it
from
stabbing
buffy
in
the
head
she
ducks
xander
hatch
careful
spike

heal
wewewe'll
rest
here
for
a
minute
but

find
will
how
is
he
will
okay
okay
justjust
give
me
a
minute
dawn
get
down
willow
will
how
long
will
it
hold
let's
find
out
he
understands
me
don't
you
took
you
long
enough
what
are
you
supposed
to
be
some
kind
of
chief
general
in
charge
of
what
getting
captured
look
at
her
that
way
again
and
she
will
be
the
last
thing
you
ever
see
it's
not
that
simple
she
doesn't
remember
anything
about
being
this
key
you're
all
looking
for
the
only
thing
that
she
remembers
is
growing
up
with
a
mother
and
a
sister
that
love
her
what
kind
of
god
would
demand
her
life
for
something
that
she
has
no
control
over
we
are
not
your
enemy
tell
your
men
to
stand
down
it
is
not
her
fault
she's
human
now
i
will
not
let
anyone
tell
me
buffy
breaks
off
as
we
hear
a
wailing
from
the
next
room
and
willow
saying
shh
shh
xander
turns
to
look
through
the
door
what
happened
i'm
sorry
we
should
have
stayed
if
we
had
none
of
this
would
have
happened
running
away
willow
open
a
door
one
of
my
friends
was
hurt
when
you
attacked
us
will
you
let
someone
come
and
help
him
or
not
i'm
done
asking
hey
uh
iit's
buffy
i
need
to
ask
you
a
really
big
favor
sorry
ii
didn't
know
who
else
to
call
thank
you

for
coming
well
i
think
the
guys
with
the
pointy
swords
kinda
have
other
ideas
look
i
know
this
must
seem
extra
outer
limits
to
you
look
if
this
gets
too
weird
just
tell
me
i'll
understand
we're
all
gonna
make
it
i'm
not
losing
anyone
check
the
supplies
see
if
anyone's
hungry
shut
up
why
don't
you
tell
me
strong
fast
hellgod
a
demon
dimension
i
know
she
ruled
with
two
other
hellgods
right
a
god
afraid
kill
the
man

and
the
god
dies
i
don't
understand
now
i've
seen
glory
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
the
hairy
chest
department
dawn
why
didn't
they
just
destroy
it
if
the
key
is
as
dangerous
as
gregor
because
they
were
fools
they
thought
they
could
harness
its
power
for
the
forces
of
light
they
failed
and
paid
with
their
blood
that's
it
that's
glory's
master
plan

to
go
home
dawn
i
don't
know
it's
not
you
you
know
that
i
won't
let
anything
happen
to
you
i
promise
what
happened
okay
wwill
open
a
door
dawn
willow
get
it
down
now
