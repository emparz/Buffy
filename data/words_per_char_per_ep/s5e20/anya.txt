you
threw
it
at
her
piano
we
should
drop
a
piano
on
her
well
it
always
works
for
that
creepy
cartoon
rabbit
when
he's
running
from
that
nice
man
with
the
speech
impediment
run
away
finally
a
sensible
plan
anybody
else
feel
that
cold
draft
of
paralyzing
fear
overwhelming
how
much
more
than
whelming
would
that
be
exactly
shouldn't
somebody
be
asking
are
we
there
yet
isn't
that
what
small
entertaining
children
do
do
we
know
where
we're
going
yet
he
doesn't
travel
well
he's
like
fine
shrimp
ooh
snacks
the
secret
to
any
successful
migration
who's
up
for
some
tasty
fried
meat
products
not
a
piano
but
hey
um
you
have
another
plan
right
one
that
doesn't
involve
pointy
knives
and
a
winnebago
ii
don't
know
she
just
went
nuts
want
me
to
try
