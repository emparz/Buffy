eye
on

enough
room
for
me

gonna
toss
your
cookies
on
my
shoes
fine
shrimp

stopped
smoking
you
go
ahead
and

peekaboo
with
mister
sunshine

keeps
the
ride
from
getting
boring

be
a
good
time
for
something
heroic
i

easy
with
the
delicates
florence
bloody
nightingale
to
the
rescue
so
what's
the
story
with
these
roleplaying
rejects
you
sure
scarface
here
can
habla
the
english
handier
than
a
swiss

this
nasty
squeak

you
could
ow
thanks

mighta
let
it
slip
in

once
or
twice
nothing
compared
to
the
little
bits
we're
gonna
get
chopped
into
when
the
renaissance
faire
kicks
the
door
in
and
here
we
bloody
sit
could
make
a
break
for
it
use
general
armorall
as
a
shield
get
to
the
doc's
car
and
look
we
stay
here
we
all
die
at

of
us
might
get
the
car

the
keys
