of
my
body
oh
god
not
really
my
color
anyway
that's
not
how
it
works
you
know
that
if
i
did
do
you
really
think
i
would
tell
you
glory
her
name
is
glory
and
she's
your
god
you
little
scab
not
mine
you
mean
her
divine
failure
don't
you
i
didn't
ask
for
any
of
this
i
just
want
to
be
normal
nothing's
mine
is
it
this
life
this
body
it's
all
infected
the
only
thing
i
ever
cared
about
she's
taken
away
from
me
you
know
why
i
wanted
to
be
a
doctor
to
be
close
to
people
to
witness
their
lives
and
their
deaths
to
be
there
alongside
them
a
part
of
everyday
humanity
maybe
it's
the
drugs
find
the
right
combination
keep
her
buried
where
she
belongs
oh
yeah
i'm
thrilled
especially
with
the
part
where
she
gets
her
key
back
and
i
cease
to
exist
not
if
i
get
the
key
first
it
doesn't
matter
how
i
came
by
it
it's
mine
and
i
plan
on
keeping
it
you
uh
forgot
to
mention
the
costume
party
outside

it's
okay

mean
yeah

how
i
pictured
seeing
you
again

take
what
i
can
get
my
pleasure

lot
of
damage

worn
out
my
welcome

a
friend
of
the
family

my
life

terrible
things

to
good
people
