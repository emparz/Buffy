you
have
him
welcome
home
orlando
i
swear
by
my
sword
your
sacrifice

will
not
go
unavenged
yes
i
suppose
it
is
watch
him
make
sure
he's
comfortable
the
key
you've
seen
it
the
monks
they've
made
it
human
prepare
to
advance
we
end
this
now
the
key
you
were
warned
we
would
return
slayer
general
you
do
not
frighten
me
child
the
instrument
of
chaos
must
be
destroyed
as
i've
been
told
you
protect
the
key
of
the
beast
yes
the
key
has
been
transformed
given

breath
life
yet
this
makes
no
difference
the
key
is
the
link
the
link
must
be
severed
such
is
the
will
of
god
no
the
key
is
too
dangerous

to
be
allowed
to
exist
no
matter
what
form
it
has
been
pressed
into
dissention
in
the
ranks
seldom
a
harbinger
of
glad
tidings
poor
frightened
girl
you've
no
idea
what
you've
gotten
yourself
into
would
it
make
a
difference
what
do
you
know
of
the
beast
from
a
dimension
of
unspeakable
torment
along
with
the
beast
they
were
a
triumvirate
of
suffering
and
despair
ruling
with
equal
vengeance
but
the
beast's
power
grew
beyond
even
what
they
could
conceive
as
did
her
lust
for
pain
and
misery
they
looked
upon
her
what
she
had
become

and
trembled
such
was
her
power
they
feared
she
would
attempt
to
seize
their
dimension
for
herself
and
decided
to
strike
first
a
great
battle
erupted
in
the
end
they
stood
victorious
over
the
beast

barely
she
was
cast
out
banished
to
this
lower
plane
of
existence
forced
to
live
and
eventually
die
trapped
within
the
body
of
a
mortal

a
newborn
male
created
as
her
prison
that
is
the
beast's

only
weakness
unfortunately
the
identity
of
the
human
vessel
has
never
been
discovered
you
have
seen
a
glimpse
of
the
true
beast
her
power
was
too
great
to
be
completely
contained
she's
found
a
way
to
escape
her
mortal
prison

for
brief
periods
before
her
energies
are
exhausted
and
she's
forced
back

into
her
living
cell
of
meat
and
bone
the
key

is
almost
as
old
as
the
beast
itself
where
it
came
from
how
it
was
created

the
deepest
of
mysteries
all
that
is
certain
is
that
its
power
is
absolute
countless
generations
of
my
people
have
sacrificed
their
lives
in
search
of
it
to
destroy
it
before
its
wrath
could
be
unleashed
yes
and
hid
it
with
their
magicks
because
they
were
fools
they
thought
they
could
harness
its
power
for
the
forces
of
light
they
failed
and
paid
with
their
blood
you
were
created

to
open
the
gates
that
separate
dimensions
the
beast
will
use
your
power

to
return
home
and
seize
control
of
the
hell
she
was
banished
from
you
misunderstand
once
the
key
is
activated
it
won't
just
open
the
gates
to
the
beast's
dimension
it's
going
to
open
all
the
gates
the
walls
separating
realities
will
crumble
dimensions
will
bleed
into
each
other
order
will
be
overthrown
and
the
universe
will
tumble
into
chaos

all
dark

forever
that

is
what
you
were
created
for
you
you
are
not
a
part
of
this
are
you
would
you
die
for
them
because
that
is
what
your
future
holds
if
you
align
yourself
with
the
slayer
and
her
misguided
people
it's
not
just
your
life
unimaginable
legions
will
perish
including
everyone
here
you
can
stop
this
you
can
save
all
their
lives
by
ending
one
the
little
girl
the
key
destroy
it
and
the
will
of
the
beast
will
be
broken
she
will
fade
a
distant
memory

and
all
of
this
madness
will
end
the
beast
