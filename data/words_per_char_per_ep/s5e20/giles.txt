i
knew
you'd
best
glory
eventually
i
mean
allall
our
years
of
training
buffy
a
truck
hit
her
oh
well
how
isn't
important
all
that
matters
is
that
the
two
of
you
are
safe
there
must
be
something
in
the
book
of
tarnis
that
we've
missed
something
we
can
use
against
glory
yes
or
perhaps
we
could
paint
a
convincing
tunnel
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
let's
just
keep
thinking
everyone
perhaps
we
should
reassemble
at
the
magic
shop
see
if
there's
anything
buffy
we
can't
fight
her
wwell
not
yet
no
but
buffy
no
not
ever
she's
too
strong
giles
we're
not
gonna
win
this
with
with
stakes
or
spells
or
pulling
out
some
uranium
power
core
she's
a
god
and
she's
coming
for
us
so
let's
just
not
be
here
when
she
starts
knocking
buffy
we
all
understand
the
severity
of
the
situation
but
there
must
be
another
way
we
just
need
to
stay
calm
look
everything
will
be
all
right
we
just
need
to
stay
here
calmly
as
soon
as
buffy
arrives
a
large
winnebago
drives
up
and
screeches
to
a
halt
in
front
of
them
the
windows
are
all
covered
with
aluminum
foil
the
door
swings
open
we'll
feel
oddly
worse
what's
he
doing
here
out
step
on
what
i've
driven
tricycles
with
more
power
well
buffy
has
a
point
in
a
confrontation
spike
may
prove
useful
she's

been
through
more
than
her
fair
share
of
late
she
just
needs
a
chance
to
catch
her
breath
regroup
she'll
be
all
right
i
see
them
weapons
everyone
all
right
for
what
don't
what
you
did

wwas
necessary

what
i've
always
admired
being
able
to
place

your
heart

above
all
else
i'm
so
proud
of
you
you've
come
so
far
you're
everything
a
watcher

everything
i
could
have
hoped
for
