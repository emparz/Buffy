just
wanted
to
let
you

and
it's
not
real
safe
here
so
if
you
want
to
walk
back
to
your
dorm
see
you
guys
uh
hobbies
interests
i
feel
like
there's
so
much
i
don't
know
about
you
what
do
you
like
to
do
yeah
i
was
into
that
for
a
while
hey
what's
that
you
have
a
scar
oh
mine
are
all
psychological
well
my
father
died
last
year
no
i'm
okay
to
talk
about
it
now
and
i'm
not
doing
to
deep
get
sympathy
routine
i
mean
don't
you
just
hate
guys
that
are
all
'i'm
dark
and
brooding
so
give
me
love'
i
just
wanted
to
say
that
it
was
so
sad
cause
there
was
well
a
lot
of
stuff
that
he
didn't
finish
it
make
me
think
about
you
know
living
for
now
that's
great
i
mean
everybody
says
they
get
it
'oh
man
me
too
live
for
today'
but
what
they
really
what
is
a
reason
to
goof
off
not
study
for
finals
it's
cool
to
find
someone
else
who
understands
i'm
going
to
regret

being
too
nervous
to
ask
you
to
go
to
the
party
at
wolfhouse
tomorrow
night
do
you
want
to
go
to
the
party

it's
nice
is
your
neck
okay
i'll
pick
you
up
tomorrow
night
for
the
party
some
party
huh
last
day
in
rome
you
want
to
dance
looks
like
your
friend
started
the
party
a
little
early
huh
hi
i'm
parker
i
was
getting
a
little
worried
it's
okay
you
did
a
good
thing
for
your
friend
did
uh
you
and
he
used
to
go
out
good
now
we
have
time
to
make
up
for
think
i
could
get
a
dance
with
the
prettiest
girl
at
the
party
well
i
declared
premed
but
i
hated
it
so
i
switched
to
history
but
there
something
amazing
about
these
huge
events
that
when
you
dig
down
into
them
they're
just
about
regular
people
trying
to
make
choices
when
you
look
back
at
it
seems
like
people
were
swept
up
in
events
they
couldn't
control
but
i
don't
believe
that
i
believe
you
have
a
choice
in
everything
you
do
is
this
okay
because
i
can
stop
if
you
wanna
it's
your
choice
what
are
you
doing
hey
you're
up
i
live
here
it
looked
like
you
were
going
to
be
out
for
a
while
so
i
ran
for
coffee
better
than
what
i
got
around
here

soda
