you're
gonna
live
in
that
small
room
over
there
i
know
it
looks
like
a
closet
but
it's
a
room
now
you're
not
gonna
touch
my
food
i
take
the
first
shower
in
the
morning
and
if
i
use
up
all
the
hot
water
that's
your
tough
noogies
and
i
hate
this
plan
are
you
keeping
up
or
do
you
need
some
kind
of
englishtoconstantpaininmyass
translation
is
there
something
more
emphatic
than
hate
can
i
revile
the
plan
fine
i
invite
you
in
nimrod
i
just
don't
understand
when
his
problems
became
your
problems—more
specifically
mine
why
not
crazybasementguy
is
better
than
stalkingbuffyguy
i'm
sure
that'll
be
a
real
comfort
when
he
soulfully
attacks
you
again
things
are
a
lot
better
i
see
right
with
the
wailing
and
the
crying
still
better
than
a
cozy
evening
with
spike
shall
i
order
a
pizza
don't
teens
in
a
snit
like
pizza
remember
when
she
used
to
have
a
crush
on
me
i
miss
the
much
cuter
me
crush
now
now
let's
not
be
hasty
not
the
right
time
it's
the
jacket
it's
true
something
about
the
big
letter
on
the
chest
makes
girls
get
all
swoony
and
crushy
i
saw
it
all
the
time
in
school
and
you
couldn't
just
pin
any
old
felt
letter
to
your
coat
and
get
play—
not
that
i
tried
well
spike
definitely
seems
a
little
more
cogent
less
blblblblbl
i'm
just
saying
once
you
get
back
the
soul
doesn't
that
mean
you
start
like
picking
up
your
own
wet
towels
off
the
floor
buff
he
don't
seem
so
tough
daddy
like
oh
oh
no
daddy—
no
i
wasn't—
when
i
was
looking
i
wasn't—
oh
god
dawn
what's
wrong
is
this—
did
that
guy
in
the
jacket—
i
just
called
him
that
guy
in
the
jacket
dawnie
honey
you
seem
extremely
perturbed
maybe
i
should
go
get
buffy—
i
thought
that
was
about
that
guy
in
the—
um
that
guy
with
the
thing
buffy
i
think
dawn
needs
y—
uuh
i'm
sorry
it's
just
checkout
time
was
an
hour
ago
we
were
hoping
to
make
up
the
bed
also
it's
a
classroom
you
chowderhead
now
get
off
the
boy
buffy
we're
going
home

under
a
love
spell
that's
what
this
has
to
be
we'll
be
working
well
at
least
the
yelling
went
away
it
was
starting
to
sound
like
christmas
morning
with
my
family
hey
been
there
good
times
family
stuff
hey
i
knew
his
brother
he
was
a
big
jock
at
sunnydale
high
too
couple
years
ahead
of
us
he
used
to
stick
chewing
gum
in
my
hair
huh
well
i
think
my
relationship
with
rj's
brother
was
complex
at
best
butmaybe
he's
a
way
in
i'm
just
saying
we're—we're
tangling
with
a
powerful
spell
here
we
don't
know
what
the
deal
is
so—so
keep
an
eye
out
if
this
guy
looks
twitchy
and
don't
let
this
guy
charm
you
either
he
had
everyone
around
him
practically
kissing
his
ring
back
in
high
school
yeah
good
it's
just—
i
know
a
girl
that
might
be
going
out
with
him
and
i
was
wondering—
yeah
i
gather
that
rj
is
pretty
popular
too
and
do
you
have
any
idea
why
he
you
know
burst
into
a
flower
all
of
a
sudd—
so
lance
where
did
you
get
the
jacket
wow
that's
wonderful
boy
it's
getting
late
we
really
gotta
go
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
will
honey
rj's
a
guy
much
time
before
what
and
how
are
they
gonna
do
that
exactly
fine
ok
let's
start
there
hey
crazy
chicks—look
now
you're
sure
you
understand
the
plan
that
my
friends
is
the
smell
of
sweet
sweet
victory
i
refuse
to
answer
that
on
the
grounds
that
it
didn't
fit
yeah
welcome
to
the
hellmouth
where
even
outerwear
isn't
safe
true
you
fell
for
a
mystical
ancient
curse
who
hasn't
made
that
mistake
seven
eight
times
