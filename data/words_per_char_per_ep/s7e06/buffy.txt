already
stopped
talking
to
invisible
people
ok
so
there
was
that
one
episode
in

your
closet

a
good
question

feeling
i
think
i
can't
stand
him
but
sometimes
no
i—i
feel
for
him
dawn
for
the
record
spike

i
guess
d'hoffryn
decided
to
take
you
out
after
all
i
get
it
after
last
week
you
feel
you
need
to
be
all
renegade
and
broody
taking
yourself
out
of
the
loop—
another
something
bad
is
happening

sure
he
already
noticed
you
i
mean
with
the
falling

the
spirit
spirit

of
you
it'd
be
nice

his
lies
didn't
involve
my
sister

a
refreshing
and
delightful
change

the
thickest

is—
lead
a
team
of
high
school
athletes
trying
their
best
to
do
a
good
job
everyone
depending
on
me
that
is
a
lot
of
pressure
but
it
doesn't
mean
you
get
to
disregard
other
people's
feelings
i
know
i
know
that
it's
just—
you're
a
leader
a
captain
ok
people
look
up
to
you
you
need
to
keep
that
in
mind
when
you—

run
a
lot

mean
they
work
you
pretty
hard
