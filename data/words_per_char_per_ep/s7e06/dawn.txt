it's
true
you
guys
aren't
you're
not
starting
up
again
with
the
whole—
yeah
what
does
that
mean
exactly—that
spike
is
all
soulhaving
so
what
is
it
last
night
you
said
you
weren't
helping
spike
out
of
pity
what
is
it
is
sitting
there
drinking
soda
some
kind
of
a
zen
nonanswer
you
love
him
feel
what
exactly
no
i'm—i'm
just
trying
to
understand
i
mean
none
of
it
makes
sense
first
you
say
spike
disgusts
you
but
secretly
you
two
are
doing
it
like
bunnies
and
then
spike
says
he'd
die
for
you
but
he
tries
to
rape
you
but
to
get
a
soul
like
that
would
make
him
a
better
man
xander
had
a
soul
when
he
stood
anya
up
at
the
altar
and
now
he
says
he
still
wants
her
i
just
don't
think
it's
the
school
basement
that's
making
people
crazy
i
just
don't
see
why
people
bother
i
mean
you
put
all
this
energy
into
chasing
and
having
and
brooding
and—
i
just
don't
understand
these
relationships
where
you
all
do
insane
things
well
you
could
like
paint
a
beautiful
mural
on
every
ugly
wall
in
the
world
and
then
you
could
paint
a
beautiful
mural
on
every
ugly
mural
in
the
wor—

in
a
good
fun
way
hey
um
so
you
know
i
heard
someone
saying
yesterday
that
we're
gonna
go
all
the
way
to
the
championships
this
year
in
football
the
quarterback
is
like
the
most
important
member
of
the
team
he
is
like
the
rudder
that
guides
the
ship
yeah
you're
all
on
the
team
we'll
talk
later
guys
that's
cool

gonna
play
we
got
a
secret
weapon
and
his
name
is
rj

us
cheer
hear
us
yell
listen
what
we
say
razorbacks
razorbacks
go
rj
how
would
you
even
know
rj's
never
gonna
notice
me
now
go
away
it
is
not
a
snit
ii
finally
met
him—they
guy
of
my
dreams
ok—and
i
blew
it
rj
hates
me
now
just
the
end
of
my
life
i'll
buy
you
a
new
one
i
do
know
him
i
know
his
soul
it
isn't
a
crush
it's
love
i
love
rj
what
you're
telling
me
i
don't
feel
what
i
feel
you
know
what
maybe
i
don't
want
advice
from
the
dysfunction
queen
you
have
no
idea
how
i
feel
you
have
no
idea
what
real
love
is
maybe
if
you
did
you
wouldn't
make
fun
of
me
this
way
just
go
leave
me
alone
you
can't
do
this
to
rj
it
isn't
fair
he
works
so
hard
but
nobody's
better
than
rj
it
all
happened
so
fast
i
mean
one
minute
he
was
walking
and
the
next
he
stumbled
and
then
he
fell
i
don't
know
maybe
he
was
just
embarrassed
it's
hard
being
clumsy
especially
when
you're
popular
and
athletic
i'd
bet
at
least
you
still
got
rj
to
take
over
that's
ok
i'm
just
really
sorry
it
happened
hi
well
yeah
yes
yeah
no
one
expects
the
spanish
inquisition
god
it's
like
i
have
a
disease
or
something
it
was
really
no
big
deal
we
just
talked
he
just
wanted
me
to
tell
him
about
the
accident
right
out
of
nowhere
uh
hmm
what
yeah
well
i
think
i
look
hot
and
so
does
rj
no
don't
you
dare
embarrass
me
in
front
of
him
it's
my
life
i'll
do
what
i
want
to
oh
so
what—suddenly
you're
mom
now
you
just
can't
handle
it
you've
always
been
the
special
one
hot
little
buffy
with
her
boyfriends
the
slayer
and
now
someone
likes
me
and
you
just
can't
stand
that
i'm
getting
the
attention
no
it's
not
and
i'm
sorry
but
i
like
the
way
rj
makes
me
feel
and
if
you
think
that
makes
me
a
slut
or
whatever
i
don't
care
rj
rj's
cheerleader
friend
steps
out
from
the
shadows
so
we
were
just
dancing
you
know
what's
sad
a
girl
who
can't
move
on
when
she's
been
dumped
let
go
of
me
this
isn't
finished
ambush
really
tell
me
what
he
said
about
me—every
word—including
intonation
and
facial
expressions
yes
he
did
i
can
tell
oh
my
god
i'm
the
pushy
queen
of
slut
town
i'm
just
scared
that
while
i'm
laying
back
some
other
girl's
gonna
come
and
sweep
him
up
yeah
i
guess
so
thank
you
i'm
not
coming
on
too
strong
if
i
just
look
at
him
uh
i
don't
even
want
to
hear
his
name
anymore
that's
what
i
used
to
call
him
in
my
head
before
i
knew
his
real
name
no
i
don't
ever
want
to
see
her
again
no
it's
about
both
of
them
what
do
you
know
about
our
love
it's
true
and
real
this
isn't
magic
this
is
my
heart
it
is
so
real
i
love
him
you
knew
how
i
felt—like
i
finally
found
something
and
you
betrayed
me
your
lover
you're
lover
that's
right
you
lied
to
me
it's
not
a
crush
stop
you're
not
supposed
to
do
this
no
because
you
were
the
one
i
trusted
what's
going
on
what
no
you
two
can't
do
this
this
isn't
fair
how
can
you
all
be
doing
this
to
me
uh
this
isn't
a
spell
he
owns
my
heart
i
need
him
no
never
it
doesn't
matter
what
am
i—gonna
compete
with
you
you're
older
and
hotter
and
have
sex
that's
rough
and
kill
people
i
don't
have
any
of
that
stuff
but
if
i
did
this
then
his
whole
life
he'd
know
there
was
someone
that
loved
him
so
much
they'd
give
up
their
life
and
it
would
be
true
forever
rj
is
and
don't
say
he
isn't
look
what
you
were
willing
to
do
but
i—i
thought
you
wanted
him
for
you
i
hear
ya
i'm
just
so
the
way
i
acted
the
way
i
talked
to
you
i
feel
so
stupid
all
over
a
spell
