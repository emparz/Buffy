hey
summers
we
all
did
i
actually
kinda
liked
him
yeah
we
actually
have
a
good
shot
considering
we're
a
new
team
oh
like
you
could
do
better
wait
you
actually
think
coach'd
start
you
at
quarterback
over
me
right
could
i
give
you
a
hand
with
that
hey
we're
all
on
the
same
team
all
right
yeah
i
told
you
man—all
those
fumbles
in
practice—he
was
gonna
come
down
on
you
great
who
knew
fumbling
all
the
time
was
the
key
yeah
sure
summers
hey
i
heard
wood
hauled
you
into
his
office
about
o'donnell
that
sucks
facing
the
whole
inquisition
thing
no
it
was
i
think
it's
cool
that
you
faced
him
wood
yeah
it
sucks
when
these
things
just
happen—out
of
nowhere
you
know
i
was
thinking
of
heading
out
tonight
after
practice
you
want
to
meet
up
whatever
oh
man
like
it's
not
bad
enough
i
got
that
guy
riding
my
back
all
the
time
now
i
gotta
deal
with
you
too
yeah
but
come
on—
hey
i
told
him
i
was
sorry
about
the
homework
hey
i
didn't
do
anything
to
your
sister
and
you
saw
how
hot
she
looked
last
night
i
think
that
proved
that
she—
ok
look
it's
not
like
that
i
just—
get
along
really
well
with
girls
it's
not
like
i
meant
to
hurt
anyone
yeah
i
guess
so
i
think
i
hear
what
you're
saying
ok
thanks
there's
no
one
here
the
thing
of
it
is
the
time
nobody
gets
how
much
time
goes
into
it
with
practices
and
games
i
still
say
wood's
the
worst
you
haven't
seen
the
way
that
guy
rides
me
i
wish
somebody'd
get
him
off
my
back
and
sometimes
i
didn't
even
do
anything
wrong—
you're
like
a
teacher
not
so
much
hey
guy
it's
called
knocking
i
was
looking
for
buffy
miss
summers
are
you
sure
uhhuh
ok
tell
her
to
call
me
