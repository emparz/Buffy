they're
just
test
scores
right
what
do
they
really
mean
anyway
the
thought
had
occurred
to
me
i
don't
know
i
guess
my
future
i
never
really
thought
about
it
i
wasn't
even
sure
i
was
going
to
have
one
so
is
this
where
is
this
retreat
thingy
the
yukon
okay
but
you're
just
going
for
a
few
days
right
i
mean
you're
not
gonna
settle
there
and
grow
crops
or
anything
giles
you
pack
like
me
yeah
she
saw
these
scores
and
her
head
spun
around
and
exploded
yes
she
was
happy
she
started
with
all
this
crazy
talk
about
me
going
to
college
maybe
someplace
else
i
know
i
know
i
said
that
you
were
gonna
have
a
goat
responsibilities
and
all
i
know
the
drill
yeah
i
know
i
figured
you'd
okay
be
kind
rewind
wow
'anything
rash'
meaning
yes
actually
i
am
look
but
there's
not
gonna
be
any
rash
anywhere
okay
we're
we're
friends
that's
all
either
of
us
wants
nothing's
gonna
happen
could
we
talk
about
this
another
time
all
day
it's
been
like
'congratulations
go
away'
not
really
seeing
the
distinction
yeah
it's
just
not
that
simple
i
have
responsibilities
that
faith
could
be
miss
sunnydale
in
the
slayer
pageant
i
know
higher
education
kind
of
an
intense
proposition
i
have
no
idea
my
mom
was
the
one
that
got
all
these
she's
so
excited
she
can't
stop
talking
about
it
i
had
a
really
hard
time
coming
up
with
an
alibi
so
i
could
come
over
here
big
no
she's
having
enough
trouble
dealing
with
the
slayer
issue
i
don't
think
she's
ready
to
process
the
information
that
you
and
i
are
friends
again
anyway
i
think
this
college
jones
is
just
a
reaction
to
the
whole
slayer
thing
someplace
a
little
less
hellmouthy
she
has
a
point
y'know
but
there
are
reasons
to
stay
too
um
you
know
there's
my
slayer
duties
obviously
what
do
you
think
i
should
do
yeah
it's
not
like
there's
any
great
thing
keeping
me
here
thanks
for
the
advice
it's
another
perspective
to
consider
yeah
well
my
mom
starts
worrying
a
lot
earlier
these
days
yeah
not
all
of
us
have
dates
tonight
what
is
all
this
stuff
i'm
thinking
weird
science
whatever
happened
there
was
obviously
a
fight
yeah
either
they
were
taken
or
they
ran
or
maybe
i
don't
know
i
need
you
guys
to
find
giles
okay
i'm
gonna
look
for
them
maybe
they
didn't
get
too
far
uh
he's
at
a
retreat
in
the
clearing
in
breaker's
woods
so
motor
giles
uh
no
mom
actually
that's
great
but
now's
really
not
a
good
time

be
me

you
come
on
