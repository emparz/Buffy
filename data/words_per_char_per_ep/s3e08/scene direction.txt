morning
at
sunnydale
high
school
willow
and
xander
slowly
walk
together
across
the
lawn
toward
the
walkway
to
the
main
entrance
in
their
hands
they
have
the
results
of
their
scholastic
aptitude
tests
with
which
neither
is
particularly
happy
willow
searches
for
a
word
illiterate
i'm
cletus
the
slackjawed
yokel
xander
shrugs
they
fold
up
their
score
reports
as
they
near
a
bench
at
the
side
of
the
walkway
willow
sits
and
slouches
depressed
xander
sits
down
next
to
her
and
puts
his
arm
around
her
in
comfort
but
not
missing
the
opportunity
to
give
her
hair
a
gentle
stroke
behind
them
oz
and
cordelia
approach
xander
instantly
lets
go
of
willow
hops
to
his
feet
and
rushes
to
meet
her
xander
points
xander
reaches
for
cordelia's
score
report
he
snags
it
from
her
hand
unfolds
it
and
reads
it
oz
gives
willow
a
reassuring
stroke
of
her
hair
she
just
sadly
hands
him
her
report
to
see
cordelia
yanks
her
scores
from
his
hand
experience
in
covering
these
things
up
oz
to
willow
willow
gives
him
a
hurt
look
grabs
her
report
back
from
him
and
looks
down
at
the
ground
her
feelings
of
failure
evident
in
her
furrowed
brow
oz
trying
to
be
upbeat
she
gives
xander
a
pointed
look
shaking
her
head
and
clearly
mouthing
no
he
ignores
her
completely
buffy
walks
up
the
steps
from
the
street
a
long
look
on
her
face
and
joins
the
gang
willow
brightens
and
stands
up
buffy
gives
her
a
weak
nod
buffy
hands
hers
to
willow
willow
unfolds
it
and
reads
willow
very
excited
buffy
raises
her
eyebrows
at
her
friend
cordelia's
eyes
go
wide
with
amazement
willow
more
calmly
willow
folds
the
report
buffy
hands
her
scores
to
xander
for
him
to
see
she
yanks
it
out
of
xander's
hand
before
he
can
even
begin
to
unfold
it
and
checks
it
out
buffy
unsure
what
to
make
of
it
cordelia
smiling
hugely
she
gets
looks
from
everyone
xander
hands
buffy
back
her
scores
that's
a
good
thing
what
kind
of
moron
would
ever
wanna
come
back
here
spike
chuckles
he
passes
out
and
collapses
back
to
the
pavement
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
spike's
old
burnedout
factory
the
place
is
a
shambles
although
the
great
table
where
giles
started
the
fire
is
essentially
intact
if
scorched
spike
strolls
through
the
area
stepping
over
the
strewn
chairs
while
singing
a
few
bars
from
my
way
when
he
reaches
the
bottom
he
breaks
out
into
a
pathetic
fit
of
giggles
which
quickly
turn
to
sobs
he
sniffs
a
few
times
and
wipes
his
nose
on
his
sleeve
he
sees
what's
left
of
the
burned
bed
and
steps
up
to
it
steadying
himself
on
a
pillar
in
despair
he
tosses
his
liquor
bottle
onto
the
bed
and
steps
around
the
column
from
there
he
sees
those
members
of
drusilla's
doll
collection
that
didn't
survive
the
fire
piled
on
her
dresser
all
badly
scorched
he
reaches
for
one
and
picks
it
up
the
features
on
its
fine
porcelain
face
can
still
be
made
out
but
the
paint
hair
and
dress
are
long
gone
he
stares
at
the
doll
intensely
he
tries
to
suppress
a
sob
and
shakes
it
off
and
suddenly
he's
wearing
his
game
face
he
roars
at
the
doll
angrily
and
throws
it
hard
down
at
the
concrete
floor
he
spins
around
looking
for
something
to
smash
it
with
he
finds
a
tall
iron
candlestick
grabs
it
and
wields
it
back
spike
swings
the
candlestick
spike
swings
again
worthless
swings
again
bitch
calms
a
bit
look
what
you've
done
to
me
he
stares
down
at
what's
left
of
the
doll
its
delicate
porcelain
features
smashed
and
scattered
limbs
torn
and
singed
he
drops
the
iron
candlestick
on
top
of
it
cordelia
raises
her
eyebrows
at
him
let's
see
xander
skips
around
to
her
other
side
cordelia
can't
help
but
give
him
a
warm
smile
and
giggle
from
his
new
vantage
point
xander
can
now
see
the
inside
of
her
locker
door
there
are
three
pictures
of
them
one
of
the
two
of
them
sitting
on
a
bench
with
their
arms
around
each
other
and
smiling
another
of
just
xander
sporting
a
huge
smile
and
the
third
of
her
riding
on
xander's
back
smiling
playfully
with
her
arms
wrapped
tightly
around
his
neck
xander
not
yet
sure
what
to
make
of
it
she
closes
her
locker
and
they
begin
walking
down
the
hall
cordelia
smiles

coming
the

way

gives

look

and
then

down
the
hall
to
class
willow
follows
him
with
her
gaze
for
a
moment
her
expression
showing
her
worry
about
the
levels
of
complexity
this
just
added
to
her
life
she
looks

all
the
way
he
holds
his
hands
under

it's
going
at
just
a
trickle
quickly
he
bends
down
and
jams
his
hand
into
the
pool
of
water
at
its
base
dousing
the
flames
no
sooner

problem
gone
than
he

beginning
to
smoke
elsewhere

pulls
at
