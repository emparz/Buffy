and
what
exactly
did
this
demon
look
like
ah
and
you
say
he
has
the
books
of
ascension
or
will
soon
and
he
was
what
willing
to
sell
them
hmm
you
know
what
i
wish
i
wish
you'd
pull
your
hair
back
i
know
i
know
fashion's
not
exactly
my
thing
but
gosh
darn
it
you
know
you've
got
such
a
nice
face
i
can't
understand
why
you
hide
it
you
know
you
worry
too
much
for
a
girl
for
your
age
that's
unnecessary
stress
luckily
i've
got
just
the
thing
there
you
go
now
first
you
load
up
on
calcium
then
find
this
demon
kill
the
heck
out
of
him
and
bring
the
books
to
me
oh
well
frankly
i
don't
like
to
think
about
that
i
like
good
positive
up
thoughts
if
you
fail
me
in
that
way
well
you
know
replacing
mr
trick
was
chore
enough
oh
come
on
don't
worry
drink
up
there's
nothing
uncool
about
healthy
teeth
and
bones
hey
there's
no
need
to
convince
me
i'm
sure
you
gave
it
your
level
best
i
just
don't
understand
what
that
boy
could
be
thinking
hey
come
on
don't
be
discouraged
you're
a
bright
young
energetic
girl
with
a
whole
life
ahead
of
her
and
i
won't
tolerate
brooding
so
you
couldn't
give
him
that
one
moment
of
true
happiness
and
he
spurns
your
advances
so
be
it
there's
more
than
one
way
to
skin
a
cat
and
i
happen
to
know
that's
factually
true
we
want
to
take
angel's
soul
away
if
we
can't
do
it
by
giving
him
happiness
well
by
golly
we'll
just
have
to
do
it
in
the
most
painful
way
imaginable
mint
didn't
think
so
well
scheduling
a
man
of
your
talents
is
quite
the
chore
i'll
tell
you
between
the
chanting
and
the
sacrifice
oh
my
golf
game
is
shot
but
heeere
you
are
you
know
why
i've
summoned
you
can
you
do
it
need
anything
from
me
big
job
alright
oh
that's
just
swell
listen
you
sure
you
don't
want
any
let's
just
take
things
step
by
step
for
the
moment
now
then
angelus
may
i
call
you
angel
ah
you
know
angelus
attitude
may
get
you
attention
but
courtesy
wins
respect
i
am
the
one
responsible
for
your
new
attitude
no
problems
with
the
transition
no
side
effects
that's
terrific
poetic
too
not
that
i
read
much
poetry
except
for
those
little
ones
in
the
reader's
digest
you
know
some
of
those
are
quite
catchy
kids
today
rush
rush
rush
well
the
point
angel
is
you're
a
very
powerful
young
man
good
for
faith
and
there
just
may
be
future
for
you
in
sunnydale

see
you're
admiring
my
letter

what

just
a
cornerstone
in
my
plans
for
this
great
town
of
ours
uck
eew
awful
things
unsanitary
but
my
question
is
now
that
faith
has
brought
you
back
what
are
your
intentions
fine

know
it's
nice
to
see
you're
not
one
of
those
slacker
types
running
around
town

fine
just
make
it
a
slow
one
wonderful

we
don't
want
a
replacement

can't
all
turn
out
like
my
girl
faith

fun
uh
try
to
have
her
home
by

not
a
little
girl
anymore

always
have
me
faith

the
best
the
most
important
friend
you'll
ever
have
besides
you
know
once
the
ascension
starts
the
'in'
crowd
you're
so
concerned
about
whoo
they'll
be
lucky
if
there's
enough
left
of
them
to
fill
a
pothole
promise
still
unhappy
okeydoke
i've
got
two
words
that
are
going
to
make
all
the
pain
go
away
