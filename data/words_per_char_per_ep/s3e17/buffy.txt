well
that
was
very

artistic
wasn't
what
i
expected
i've
never
actually
seen
well
from
the
title
i
thought
it
was
about
food
right
the
the
scene
with
the
the
food
so
feel
like
getting
some
hot
chocolate
or
some
cold
shower
a
little
scary
and
a
little
not
which
is
also
scary
i'm
sorry
i
just
i
don't
like
getting
you
worked
up
like
that
we
can't
actually
do
any
of
those
things
you'd
lose
your
soul
just
don't
like
to
rub
your
nose
in
it
suddenly
wondering
where
that
expression
comes
from
it
doesn't
drive
you
crazy
when
we're
close
patrol
okay
goodnight
thanks
faith
when
it
comes
to
angel
do
me
a
favor
duck
people
never
heard
of
'em
don't
know
before
he
what
not
really
looking
to
trade
with
a
demon
oh
let
him
go
i
don't
think
he
falls
into
the
deadly
threat
to
humanity
category
i'd
like
to
know
about
these
books
of
ascension
anything
that
would
pin
the
mayor
down
would
be
great
well
he
said
the
books
were
worth
the
price
well
we
have
a
winner
so
ascension
possibly
not
a
lovein
yeah
anybody
got
five
thousand
dollars
i
think
faith
might
be
useful
in
that
persuasion
part
well
i'll
go
back
to
the
scene
see
if
i
can
track
him
that
could
be
hours
the
girl
makes
godot
look
punctual
i'll
just
go
myself
fashion
tip
wes
mouth
looks
better
closed
you
beat
up
willy
how
much
i
know
this
it's
down
by
the
bus
station
not
the
nicest
part
of
town
i'll
remember
to
mention
that
actually
i
can
handle
this
one
solo
right
got
our
demon
faith
careful
missed
you
last
night
so
i've
heard
looks
like
somebody
got
here
first
this
wasn't
just
a
hit
this
was
somebody's
idea
of
a
party
it's
nothing
it's
nothing
i
went
to
angel's
last
night
and
faith
was
there
they
looked
sort
of
intimate
you're
right
faith
would
never
do
that
comfort
remember
comfort
here
actually
no
sometimes
i
wonder
angel
and
faith
have
a
lot
in
common
i
was
say
you
mean
when
i
straightforwardly
asked
him
what
was
going
on
i
couldn't
i
mean
not

but
i

thank
you
i
don't
know
i
went
to
the
mansion
but
he
wasn't
there
she's
missing
too
what
should
we
do
i'll
go
home
and
stock
up
on
weapons
slip
into
something
a
little
more
breakandenterish
where
have
you
guys
been
okay
let's
get
the
books
someplace
safe
where
are
they
buff
you
just
called

the
matter
with
you
angel

will
kill
you
before
i
let
you
touch
me

to
get
out
of
here

you
don't
know
what
you're
doing
faith
listen
to
me
very
closely
angel's
a
killer
when
he's
done
with
me
he'll
turn
on
you
why
faith
what's
in
it
for
you
it's
not
my
fault
faith
listen
to
me
i
am
always
have
been
and
how
did
you
get
him
faith
magic
cast
some
sort
of
spell
cause
in
the
real
world
angel
would
never
touch
you
and
we
both
know
it
you
had
to
tie
me
up
to
beat
me
there's
a
word
for
people
like
you
faith
loser
for
what
your
boss's
lame

so
much
rage
in
you
graduation
day

think
we
missed
anything
may
i
say
something
psych
at
least
now

know
he
was
only
acting
xander

was
just
an
act
been
better
that's
me
one
of
the
troops
i
really
doubt
that
look
i
know
you
only
did
what
i
asked
and
we
we
got
what
we
wanted
i
know
that
it's
not

a
question
of
that
it's
just
after

little
bit
of
a
break
please
always
