faith

thanks
so
much
it's
good
to
have
the
taste
of
a
slayer
back
in
my
mouth
it's
like
cigarettes
you
know
just
when
i
thought
i'd
quit
no
don't
get
up
it's
good
to
be
back
in
sunnydale
nice
climate
plenty
to
eat
no
tortured
humanity
to
hold
me
down
but
you
know
what
bothers
me
you
don't
seem
to
be
getting
the
big
picture
here
faith
now
i
don't
know
why
you
turned
me
but
i'm
just
glad
you
did
let
me
guess
you
summoned
back
the
true
angelus
because
you
need
a
new
boy
toy
doesn't
work
that
way
funny
thing
about
vampires
faith
we
don't
establish
meaningful
dialogue
with
slayers
i
should
have
known
you'd
like
it
on
top
as
long
as
you're
there
i
mostly
want
you
to
wriggle
but
i'm
listening
still
listening
very
well
actually
i'm
thinking
more
along
the
lines
of
you
calling
me
master
that's
why
i'm
here
had
a
soul
now
i'm
free
hey
i
don't
mean
to
rush
things
here
but
are
you
trying
to
get
to
some
kind
of
point
well
actually
i
was
thinking
of
stabbing
you
through
the
heart
with
it
mmmm
can't
be
killed
but
you
don't
like
germs
well
gee
sir
i
thought
i'd
find
that
slayer
that's
given
you
so
much
trouble
and
torture
maim
and
kill
her
my
favorite
kind
that
guy
just
bugs
me
hi

in
a
long
time
you

hell
yeah
and
i'm
just
wondering
where
do
i
start
card
fruit
basket
evisceration

know
what
you're
thinking
maybe
there's
still
some
good
deep
down
inside
of
me
that
remembers
and
loves
you
if
only
you
could
reach
me
then
again
we
have
reality
one
thing
i
learned
about
buffy
she's
so
cute
when
she's
sleeping
morning
sleepyhead
you
know
what
i
just
can't
believe
all
of
our
time
together
and
we
never
tried
chains
well
can't
dwell
on
the
past
especially
with
the
future
we
have
ahead
she's
right
i
probably
will
i

not
hard
to
believe

were
a
real
soldier
last
night
buffy
i
know
how
hard
it
was
for
you
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
make
it
better

never
wanted
it
to
go
that
far
you
still
my
girl
