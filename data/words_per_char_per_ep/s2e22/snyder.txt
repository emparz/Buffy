why
do
i
find
that
so
very
hard
to
believe
buffy
summers
if
there's
trouble
she's
behind
it
attitude
problem
serious
you
do
know
this
is
a
crime
scene
don't
you
but
then
you're
a
criminal
so
that
pretty
much
works
out
in
case
you
haven't
noticed
the
police
of
sunnydale
are
deeply
stupid
it
doesn't
matter
anyway
whatever
they
find
you've
proved
too
much
of
a
liability
for
this
school
these
are
the
moments
you
want
to
savor
you
wish
time
would
stop
so
that
you
could
live
them
over
and
over
again
your
point
being
it's
snyder
tell
the
mayor
i
have
good
news
