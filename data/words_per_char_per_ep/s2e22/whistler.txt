waiting
for
you

a
date
to
the
prom

wasn't
supposed
to
go
down
like
this

saw
you
coming

figured
this
for
angel's
big
day
but
i
thought
he
was
here
to
stop
acathla
not
to
bring
him
forth
then
you
two
made
with
the
smoochies
now
he's
a
creep

i
should
ask
what
are
you
prepared
to
give
up

in
the
end
you're
always
by
yourself

all

got
the
sword

gotta
be
ready

gotta
know
how
to
use
it
you

raiding
an
englishman's
fridge
is
like
dating
a
nun
you're
never
gonna
get
the
good
stuff
angel's
the
key
his
blood
will
open
the
door
to
hell
acathla
opens
his
big
mouth
creates
a
vortex
then
only
angel's
blood
will
close
it
it's
all
on
the
line
here

one
more
thing
