day'
right
i
i
think
we're

a
certain
point
then
seizing
is
sort
of
inevitable
yeah
oh
yeah
hey
speaking
of
'wow'
potential
there's
oz
over
there
what
are
we
thinking
any
sparkage
mm
a
fixation
on
insignificant
detail
is
a
definite
crush
sign
you
think
he's
too
old
'cause
he's
a
senior
please
my
boyfriend
had
a
bicentennial
you
can't
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
waiting
for
xander
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
hottie
make
a
move
do
the
talking
thing
well
you
won't
know
until
you
try
rough
night
i
had
a
dream
that
drusilla
was
alive
and
she
killed
angel
iit
just
really
freaked
me
out
see
i
don't
know
i
don't
wanna
start
a
big
freakout
over
nothing
maybe
i
should
get
'gone'
too
i
know
i
should
keep
my
slayer
cool
but
it's
angel
which
automatically
equals
maxiwig
space
on
a
momsponsored
shopping
opportunity
not
likely
it's
funny
you
should
ask
that
you
know
i
woke
up
feeling
more
responsible
mature
and
levelheaded
i
now
possess
the
qualities
one
looks
for
in
a
licensed
driver
you
said
we
could
talk
about
it
again
when
i
was
17
and
then
my
mom
broke
the
plate
it
was
just
like
my
dream
every
gesture
every
word
it
was
so
creepy
which
means
drusilla
might
still
be
alive
giles
in
my
dream
i
couldn't
stop
her
she
blindsided
me
aangel
was
gone
before
i
knew
what
happened
that's
true
except
for
the
bread
part
okay
so
fine
we're
one
step
ahead
but
i
wanna
stay
that
way
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
until
then
right
be
that
buffy
oh
my
god
i
didn't
see
you
there
'cause
heaven
knows
there
aren't
enough
books
in
the
library
oh
which
is
not
to
bag
it's
kind
of
manly
in
an
obsessivecompulsive
kind
of
way
don't
you
think
okay
are
we
goin'
to
the
bronze
this
looks
funky
stop
for
a
sec
sorry
sacred
duty
yada
yada
yada
every
time

this
klepto
issue
uh

were
these
vamps
outs
wwhat's
going
on
you

major
grip

still
needing
backstory
here
by
drusilla
the
vamps
outside

spike's
men
what
what
about
me
'months'
but
that's
not
months
you

newfangled
flying
machines

safer
than
they
used
to
be
when
but
it's
my
birthday
okay
when
six
months
a
year
you
don't
know
how
long
it's
gonna
take

even
well
if
you
haven't
noticed
someone
pretty
much
always
wants
us
dead
we
don't

some
here

do
we
know
can
this
guy
be
stopped
without
an
army
we
need
to
find
his
weak
spots
and
we
need
to
figure
out
where
they'd
be
keeping
him
good
call
thus
freeing
us
up
for
world
saveage

be
coming
into
town
shipping
yards
airports
anything
we
need
to
stop
them
from
getting
all
the
boxes
in
one
place
this
thing
is
nasty
and
it's
real
giles
we
can't
wait
