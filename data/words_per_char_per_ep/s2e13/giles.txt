oh
good
morning
is
everything
in
order
for
the
party
here
comes
buffy
now
remember

discretion
is
the
better
part
of
valor
you
alright
buffy
you
seem
a
little
fatigued
you
fear
it
was
more
of
a
a
a
portent
still
best
to
be
uh
on
the
alert
if
drusilla
is
alive
ii
it
could
be
a
fairly
cataclysmic
state
of
affairs
go
to
class
xander
uh
don't
worry
unduly
buffy
iii'm
sure
it's
nothing
hmm
yes
well
iii'd
imagine
it
would
be
fairly
unnerving
iit's
just
that
um
part
of
the
nightmare
that
buffy
had
the
other
night
actually
transpired
even
if
she
is
alive
uh
we
can
still
protect
angel
dreams
aren't
prophecies
buffy
yyyyou
dreamt
that
the
master
had
risen
but
you
stopped
it
from
happening
absolutely
let
me
read
up
on
drusilla
uh
see
if
she
has
any
particular
patterns
why
don't
you
meet
me
here
at
700
we'll
map
out
a
strategy
go
to
classes
do
your
homework
have
supper
no
you
won't
we're
having
a
party
tonight
buffy's
surprise
party
will
go
ahead
as
we
planned
except
i
won't
be
wearing
the
little
hat
may
well
be
in
danger
as
they
have
been
before
and
i
imagine
will
be
again
one
thing
i've
learned
in
my
tenure
here
on
the
hellmouth
is
that
there
is
no
good
time
to
relax
and
buffy's
turning
17
just
this
once
and
she
deserves
a
party
precisely
yes
wwhat
happened
oh
um
a
surprise
party
i
have
no
idea
can
can
it
be
opened
the
judge
this
is
he
um
he
he
he
couldn't
be
killed
yes
um
aan
army
was
sent
against
him
most
of
them
died
but
uh
finally
they
were
able
to
dismember
him
but
uh
not
kill
him
we
need
to
get
this
out
of
town
they
should
be
back
by
now
what
happened
where's
jenny
the
more
i
study
the
judge
the
less
i
like
him
his
touch
can
literally
burn
the
humanity
out
of
you
a
true
creature
of
evil
can
survive
the
process
no
human
ever
has
um
'no
weapon
forged
can
kill
him'
not
very
encouraging
if
we
could
only
stop
them
from
assembling
him
this
could
take
time
round
robin
angel
any
luck
shshsh
seems
buffy
needed
some
rest
buffy
what's
happening
that's
very
good
however
you
you
do
need
a
plan
ii
know
you're
concerned
buffy
but
you
can't
just
go
off
halfcocked
yes
yes
well
um
actually
that's
quite
a
good
plan
right
