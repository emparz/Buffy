well
it's
the
team's
choice
it
was
their
victory
jealous
well
all
i
know
is
my
cheerleading
squad
wasted
a
lot
of
pep
on
losers
it's
about
time
our
school
excelled
at
something
xander
i
know
you
take
pride
in
being
the
voice
of
the
common
wuss
but
the
truth
is
certain
people
are
entitled
to
special
privileges
they're
called
winners
that's
the
way
the
world
works
propaganda
spouted
out
by
the
ugly
and
less
deserving
disgusting
mole
and
stupid
hat
kept
slaves
remember
i'm
doing
the
best
i
can
go
ahead
say
it
you
ran
like
a
woman
god
this
is
so
sad
we're
never
gonna
win
the
state
championship
i
think
i've
lost
all
will
to
cheerlead
well
you
could
go
out
to
the
parking
lot
and
practice
running
like
a
man
so
he
spit
it
out
i
thought
angel
liked
blood
and
their
winning
streak
zippo
we
couldn't
find
any
sea
demon
that
matched
the
description
that
xander
gave
us
not
that
chicken
little's
much
of
a
witness
but
oh
oh
oh
my
now
that
girls
is
my
kind
of
xander
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
here
get
out
of
here
before
someone
sees
you
impersonating
a
member
of
the
swim
team
really
i'm
dating
a
swimmer
from
the
sunnydale
swim
team
whoa
you
you
you
what
about
me
it's
one
thing
to
be
dating
the
lame
unpopular
guy
but
it's
another
to
be
dating
the
creature
from
the
blue
lagoon
no
one
willow
and
giles
must've
rounded
up
the
rest
of
the
swim
team
well
of
course
it
looks
scaly
the
way
you've
been
rubbing
it
dry
like
an
idiot
any
gills
yet
xander
what
are
you
doing
xander
oh
my
god
xander
it's
me
cordelia
i
know
you
can't
answer
me
but
god
this
is
all
my
fault
you
joined
the
swim
team
to
impress
me
you
were
so
courageous
and
you
looked
really
hot
in
those
speedo's
and
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
still
care
about
you
no
matter
what
you
look
like
and
and
we
can
still
date
or
or
not
i
mean
oh
my
god
i
think
we
can
safely
say
we've
found
sean
he
was
in
the
pool
skinlessdipping
i
want
you
to
know
that
you've
really
proven
yourself
to
me
and
you
don't
have
to
join
the
new
team
next
year
if
you
don't
want
i'd
be
just
as
happy
if
you
played
football
