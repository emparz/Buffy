nice
work
in
yesterday's
meet
son
now
let's
go
for
it
rosenberg
how's
the
class
everything
in
order
great
i've
been
talking
to
the
board
we've
been
having
trouble
finding
a
competent
teacher
this
late
in
the
term
do
you
think
you
could
continue
subbing
through
finals
isn't
that
nice
you're
a
team
player
and
i
like
that
a
team
player
wants
everyone
on
the
team
to
succeed
wants
everyone
to
pass
i
understand
there's
a
problem
with
gage
petronzi
i'm
not
interested
in
any
of
that
i'm
interested
in
why
when
this
school
is
on
the
brink
of
winning
its
first
state
championship
in
fifteen
years
you
slap
a
crucial
member
of
that
team
with
a
failing
mark
that
would
force
his
removal
is
that
how
you
show
your
school
spirit
gage
is
a
champion
he's
under
more
pressure
than
the
other
students
and
i
think
we
need
to
cut
him
some
slack
i
never
said
any
such
thing
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
you
recheck
your
figures
and
i
think
we'll
find
a
grade
more
fitting
to
an
athlete
of
gage's
stature
that's
not
how
it
looked
from
where
i
was
standing
coach
coach
marin
how
bad
does
it
look
i
mean
our
chances
of
winning
the
state
championship
can
we
still
do
it
that's
none
of
your
concern
you'd
better
hope
that
boy's
nose
heals
before
the
meet
this
friday
it's
a
terrible
terrible
tragedy
we
all
feel
your
pain
coach
i
don't
know
two
finer
boys
than
cameron
and
that
other
one
but
i
know
they'd
want
their
friends
to
go
on
and
win
that
state
championship
it's
time
to
think
about
the
team
you'll
find
someone
all
he
has
to
do
is
wear
a
bathing
suit
right
