time
how
could

happen
well
you
work
so
hard
you
start
to
win
suddenly
you
think
it's
just
you
you're
inspiring
the
boys
to
greatness
but
in
the
back
of
your
mind
you
start
to
wonder
maybe
i
was
afraid
to
what
are
you
a
quitter
we
got
no
room
for
quitters
on
this
team
i'm
very
close
to
perfecting
this
we
just
need
to
adjust
the
mix
they're
gonna
be
the
best
i
don't
accept
anything
less
lost
why
they're
not
lost
i'm
just
lookin'
after
my
boys

may
be
out
of
the
game

they're
still
a
team
and
a
team's
gotta
eat
you
quitter

got
some
imagination

don't
have
any
proof

fall
of
the
soviet
union

came
into
light
detailing
experiments
with
fish
dna
on
their
olympic
swimmers
tarpon
mako
shark
but
they
couldn't
crack
it
what
kind
of
question
is
that
for
the
win
to
make
my
team
the
best
they
could
be
do
you
understand
we
have
a
shot
at
the
