yeah
it's
just
so
boy
i
was
just
gonna
go
with
big
and
wet
funny
that's
how
i
feel
most
of
the
time
so
cameron
walker
you
just
won
the
state
semifinals
what
are
you
going
to
do
next
hey
pause
that
tape
for
a
second
nice
tat
what
they
ran
out
of
tweety
bird
hey
let's
let's
get
you
a
towel
see
it's
fun
to
hang
out
with
me
no
no
i
can't
say
that
i
have
cam
you
know
what
cam
thanks
i'd
forgotten
how
nice
it
is
to
just
talk
or
in
my
case
listen
without
any
romantic
pressure
i'm
comfy
i'm
so
comfy
i'm
nodding
off
actually
which
is
why
what
what
i'm
thinking
about
is
that
i
should
probably
get
out
of
this
car
oh
it's
not
me
i'm
worried
about
i
wasn't
the
attacker
principal
snyder
i
was
the
attacked
lead
you
on
when
did
i
lead
you
on
what
happened
to
dodd
so
i'm
treated
like
the
baddie
just
because
he
has
a
sprained
wrist
and
a
bloody
nose
and
i
don't
have
a
scratch
on
me
which
granted
hurts
my
case
a
little
on
the
surface
but
meanwhile
he
gets
away
with
it
because
he's
on
the
'aren't
we
the
most'
swim
team
who
by
the
way
if
no
one's
noticed
have
been
acting
like
real
jerks
lately
so
anything
new
with
you
guys
vampire
so
something
ripped
him
open
and
ate
out
his
insides
this
doesn't
make
any
sense
any
demons
with
high
cholesterol
you're
gonna
think
about
that
later
mister
and
you're
gonna
laugh
first
and
second
actually
which
means
if
my
theory's
correct
gage
petronzi
the
thirdbest
swimmer
on
the
team
would
be
the
next
item
on
the
menu
and
raise
the
possibility
that
someone
brought
forth
this
sea
monster
from
whence
it
came
to
exact
that
revenge
'from
whence
it
came'
i'm
spending
way
too
much
time
around
you
willow
he
did
say
he
could
take
care
of
things
himself
it's
a
good
call
you
should
question
him
i'm
on
it
oh
yeah
you
know
there's
just
something
about
the
smell
of
chlorine
on
a
guy
oh
baby
uh
okay
okay
okay
obviously
my
sex
appeal
is
on
the
fritz
today
so
i'll
just
give
it
to
you
straight
there's
something
lurking
out
there
and
it's
making
fillets
of
the
populace
and
i
think
you
might
be
next
well
it's
already
attacked
it's
already
killed
some
people
no
that
was
something
else
yeah
unfortunately
we
have
a
lot
of
something
elses
in
this
town
good
night
he
used
to
or
maybe
there
was
something
in
gage's
blood
that
angel
didn't
like
say
for
example
steroids
any
luck
researching
our
fish
monster
not
under
much
you
can
die
happy
what
about
jonathon
is
he
involved
oh
oh
where's
gage
gage
i'm
definitely
feeling
the
burn
but
the
bad
news
is
they're
monsters
there
it's
all
there
in
the
school
medical
records
and
nurse
greenleigh
treated
every
one
of
them
she
must
have
known
they
needed
to
win
and
winning
equals
trophies
which
equals
prestige
for
the
school
you
see
how
they're
treated
it's
been
like
that
forever
meanwhile
i'm
breaking
my
nails
every
day
battling
the
forces
of
evil
and
my
french
teacher
can't
even
remember
my
name
she
probably
went
home
for
the
day
i
think
it
can
wait
xander
why
don't
you
see
if
you
can
find
out
what
these
boys
are
taking
or
at
least
how
they're
taking
it
powders
pills
syringe
giles
loaded
up
the
tranquilizer
gun
we're
going
fishing
i
wouldn't
break
out
the
tartar
sauce
just
yet
i
mean
it's
not
like
you
were
exposed
more
than
once
i
think
we'd
better
find
the
rest
of
the
swim
team
and
lock
them
up
before
they
get
in
touch
with
their
inner
halibut
you're
really
getting
into
this
interrogation
thing
on
that
note
i
think
i'm
gonna
go
have
a
little
talk
with
our
coach
somehow
i
doubt
all
he's
been
giving
these
boys
is
inspiration
oh
well
right
now
i'm
imagining
you
in
jail
you're
wearing
a
big
orange
suit
and
oh
look
the
guards
are
beating
you
up
tell
me
what's
in
the
steam
and
you
did
sort
of
why
do
you
understand
that
i
don't
care
it's
over
there's
not
gonna
be
any
swim
team
no
i
was
in
the
line
for
shred
of
sanity
which
you
obviously
skipped
this
isn't
over
so
what
you're
just
gonna
feed
me
to
'em
great
this
is
just
what
my
reputation
needs
that
i
did
it
with
the
entire
swim
team
pull
thanks
oh
grab
my
hand
those
boys
really
love
their
coach
the
fun
never
stops
with
you
does
it
no
i
don't
think
so
i
don't
think
we'll
be
seeing
them
anymore
home
