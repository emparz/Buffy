bored
at
the

looks
around

closer
to
the

behind
a
pillar
and
peeks
out
from
behind
it
at
gage
her
change
of
position
is
not
lost
on

he
stiffens
up
frustrated
at

shoots
her
a
look
and
she
quickly
looks
away

puts
down
his

back
at
the

steps
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
pillar
to
look
around
and
practically
runs
into
gage
with
somethin'
on
your
shoe
she
steps
back
over
to
the
pool
table
side
of
the
pillar
and
gage
follows
her
around
the
other
way
and
leans
against
it
