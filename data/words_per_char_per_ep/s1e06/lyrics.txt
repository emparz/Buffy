oh
reluctant
man
who's
afraid
to
touch
the
world

why
are
you
hiding

what
is
the
base
of
all
your
fears
do
you
find
yourself
in
a
cold
cruel
world
dark
and
desperate
scared
and
lonely
selfish
man

who
never
gave
to
no
one
else

what
are
you
holding

is
it
worth
the
price
you
pay
'cause
your
eyes
they
see
just
what
you
want
to
see
and
i
hope
they're
not
staring
blindly
at
me
i'm
sure
this
rain
won't
last

i'm
sure
its
time
is
up

though
it's
pouring
down
i'm
sure
this
rain
won't
last

and
it
falls
on
job's
eyes

this
water
of
doubt

and
i'm
wading
in
lies

it's
wearing
me
out

but
if
you
want
it
alright

i'll
buy
it

i'll
buy
it

i'll
buy
it

i'll
buy
it

i'll
buy
it

i'll
