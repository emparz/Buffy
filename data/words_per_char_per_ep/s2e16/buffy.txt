can
comfort
each
other
play
your
cards
right
i
don't
know
i
just
heard
that
you
and
cordy
broke
up
and
i
guess
i
was
just
surprised
how
glad
i
was
it's
funny
how
you
can
see
someone
every
day
but
not
really
see
them
you
know
alone
at
last
oh
i'm
gonna
give
you
more
than
that
come
on
it's
a
party
aren't
you
gonna
open
your
present
so
you're
saying
this
is
all
a
game
you
make
me
feel
this
way
and
then
you
reject
me
what
am
i
a
toy
i'll
calm
down
when
you
explain
yourself
oh
i
don't
think
so
funny
i
know
what
your
face
wants
what
is
this
you're
twotiming
me
hi
oz
i
seem
to
be
having
a
slight
case
of
nudity
here
you
think
maybe
you
could
get
me
some
clothing
really
not
an
issue
scavenger
hunt
so
she
says
i
think
she's
just
so
wigged
at
hitting
on
one
of
my
friends
that
she's
repressing
she's
getting
pretty
good
at
that
i
should
probably
start
worrying
it's
better
than
everyone
trying
to
axmurder
you
right
any
particular
reason
she
should
oh
a
month
at
least
xander
come
on
i
mean
this
is
worse
for
her
than
anyone
she
loved
you
before
you
invoked
the
great
roofie
spirit
the
rest
of
us
oh
yeah
i
remember
coming
on
to
you
i
remember
begging
you
to
undress
me
and
then
a
sudden
need
for
cheese
i
also
remember
that
you
didn't
undress
me
it
meant
a
lot
to
me
what
you
said
you
came
through
there
might
just
be
hope
for
you
yet
you're
on
your
own
there
