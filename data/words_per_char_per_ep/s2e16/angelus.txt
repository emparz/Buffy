happy
valentine's
day
dru
i
knew
you'd
like
it
i
found
it
in
a
quaint
little
shopgirl
cute
here
done
i
know
dru
gives
you
pity
access
but
you
have
to
admit
it's
so
much
easier
when
i
do
things
for
her
dear
buffy
i'm
still
trying
to
decide
the
best
way
to
send
my
regards
lacks
poetry
works
in
theory
where's
buffy
perfect
i
wanted
to
do
something
special
for
buffy
actually
to
buffy
but
this
is
so
much
better
if
it's
any
consolation
i
feel
very
close
to
you
right
now
i
don't
know
what
you're
up
to
dru
but
it
doesn't
amuse
you've
gotta
be
kidding
him
i
guess
i
really
did
drive
you
crazy
ahh
sorry
dru
i
guess
you're
not
invited
