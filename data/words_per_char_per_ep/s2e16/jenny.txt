back
it
up
before
you
leave
rupert
i'm
glad
we
ran
into
each
other
actually
i
was
hoping
that
we
could
uh
do
you
have
a
minute
rupert
we
need
to
talk
hey
xander
nice
shirt
look
rupert
i
know
that
you're
angry
at
me
and
i
don't
blame
you
but
i
am
not
just
gonna
go
away
i
mean
i
care
far
too
much
about
you
to
have
you
been
working
out
xander
gives
giles
a
'see
what
i
mean'
look
giles
grabs
jenny
by
the
arms
and
pulls
her
away
and
behind
him
oh
rupert
maybe
i
need
to
talk
to
xander
alone
no
you
heard
him
so
why
don't
you
undo
your
little
magic
trick
and
get
lost
well
what
can
i
say
i
guess
xander's
just
too
much
man
for
the
pimple
squad
that's
a
laugh
no
one
can
love
two
people
at
once
what
we
have
is
real
he's
mine
get
off
