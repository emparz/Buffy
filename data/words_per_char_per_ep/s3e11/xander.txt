a
genuine
complaint
here

getting
sick
of

talking
about
the
future
guilt

expects
me

mess
up
again
like

see
how
he
is
around
me
you
know
that
steely
gaze
that
pointed
silence

but
it's
different
now
it's
more
a
verbal
nonverbal
he
speaks
volumes
with
his
eyes
aw

nazi
germany
and
i've
got
playboys
in
my
locker
