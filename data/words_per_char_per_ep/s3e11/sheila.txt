willow
ii
didn't
know
you
were
going
to
be
here
oh
hi
bunny
oh
well
i
read
about
it
in
the
paper
and
what
with
your
dad
out
of
town
willow
you
cut
off
your
hair
huh
i
like
it
hello
joyce
there's
a
rumor
going
around
mr
giles
about
witches
people
calling
themselves
witches
are
responsible
for
this
brutal
crime
well
actually
not
that
strange
i
recently
coauthored
a
paper
about
the
rise
of
mysticism
among
adolescents
and
i
was
shocked
at
the
statistical
oh
oh
aare
we
starting
oh
sit
down
honey
yes
he's
quite
concerned
oh
you
don't
have
to
explain
honey
this
isn't
exactly
a
surprise
oh
well
identification
with
mythical
icons
is
perfectly
typical
of
your
age
group
it's
a
a
classic
adolescent
response
to
the
pressures
of
incipient
adulthood
of
course
i
wish
you
could've
identified
with
something
a
little
less
icky
but
developmentally
speaking
oh
honey
i
understand
you
think
you
can
and
that's
what
concerns
me
the
delusions
well
with
king
friday
lording
it
over
all
the
lesser
puppets
and
this
is
your
way
of
trying
to
get
it
now
i
have
consulted
with
some
of
my
colleagues
and
they
agree
that
this
is
a
cry
for
discipline
you're
grounded
you're
upset
i
hear
you
willow
honey
you
don't
need
to
act
out
like
this
to
prove
your
specialness
oh
willow
willow
please
i'm
not
listening
to
this
that's
enough
is
that
clear
now
you
will
go
to
your
room
and
stay
there
until
i
say
otherwise
and
we're
gonna
make
some
changes
i
don't
want
you
hanging
out
with
those
friends
of
yours
it's
clear
where
this
little
obsession
came
from
you
will
not
speak
to
bunny
summers
again
willow
i
thought
i
made
myself
clear
you're
not
minding
me
i
see
what
you're
doing
you're
challenging
me
but
i
will
not
have
you
communicating
with
your
cybercoven
or
what
have
you
well
that
was
before
i
talked
in
depth
with
ms
summers
and
her
associates
it
seems
i've
been
rather
closeminded
i
believe
you
dear
now
all
i
can
do
is
let
you
go
with
love
it's
time
to
go
oh
and
get
your
coat
it's
chilly
out
i
said
get
your
coat
witch
hold
still
be
a
good
girl
there's
no
cure
but
the
fire
torch
oh
you
too
joyce
oh
i'd
like
that
how
nice
