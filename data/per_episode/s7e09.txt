it
didn't
hurt
too
much
ii'm
not
very
good
at
stabbing
you
know
it
wasn't
that
bad
it
was
like
a
sharp
pain
then
a
burning
then
a
general
queasiness
it's
kinda
like
when
i
used
to
get
ulcers
in
high
school
only
at
the
end
i
became
one
with
light
and
hope
i
can't
do
it
i
can't
do
it
anymore
hey
this
isn't
your
fault
ok
it's
my
fault
the
ritual
didn't
work
i
screwed
up
i'm
little—ii
don't
have
as
much
blood
as
other
people
and
i
probably
should've
told
someone
i
was
anemic
don't
worry
we're
gonna
fix
it
you
gotta
trust
us
we
know
what
we're
doing
i
can't

seated

in

now
guys
look
we
can
settle
this
one
of
two
ways
you
can
repaint
the
walls
or
i
can
suspend
you
and
report
this
little
incident
on
your
permanent
record
fine
do
that
ok
i
was
bluffing
i
hadn't
really
thought
that
one
through
principal
wood
leans
forward
listen
this
whole
permanent
record
thing
is
such
a
myth
anyway
colleges
never
ask
for
anything
past
your
sat
scores
and
it's
not
like
employers
are
gonna
be
calling
up
to
check
to
see
how
many
days
you
missed
back
in
high
school
so
listen
ii
could
suspend
you
principal
wood
stands
walks
around
desk
but
that
would
mean
calling
your
parents
alerting
your
teachers
filling
out
paperwork
and
quite
possibly
having
to
talk
to
the
school
board
principal
wood
sits
on
desk
in
front
of
them
all
of
which
sounds
positively
exhausting
to
me
no
no
i
think
it
would
be
much
easier
if
i
just
called
the
police
let
them
deal
with
it
principal
wood
looks
in

eyes
oh
and
in
case
you're
wondering
this
is

your
chip
stop
working
i
wasn't
aware
that
it
had
you
know
not
'til
now
and
the
losing
time
how
long
has
that
been
going
on
oh
things
have
been
wonky
since
i
got
back
ever
since—
you
got
your
soul

how'd
you
get
your
soul
back

traveled
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
made
a
deal
with
a
demon
just
like
that
no

just
like
that
there
was
a
price
there
were
trials
torture
pain
and
suffering
of
sorts
of
sorts
well
it's
all
relative
isn't
it
meaning
meaning
i
have
come
to
redefine
the
words
pain
and
suffering
since
i
fell
in
love
with
you
buffy

how
can
you
say
that

i
never
understood
it
though
not
until
now
you

it
out
on
me

just
now

wretched
as
i
was
i

buffy's
sitting

talking
to
willow
and
dawn
who
are
on
the
couch
he
didn't
seem
to
want
anything
to
do
with
me
i
mean
he
just
pushed
me
aside
and
charged
at
the
wall
are
you
hurt
xander
and
anya
come
downstairs
and
join
the
conversation
not—not
really
dawn
to
xander
how
is
what's
his
name
he's
got
a
good
chunk
taken
out
of
his
neck
but
he'll
be
all
right
had
to
tie
him
up
again
but
mainly
just
to
keep
him
from
scratching
at
his
bandages
xander
to
buffy
what
the
hell
happened
up
there
ii
don't
know
spike
and
i
were
having
a
conversation
and
he
was
fine
i
mean
you
know
fine
as
spike
can
be
and
then
i
went
to
check
on
you
guys
and
when
i
got
back
it
was
like
he
was
a
completely
different
person
different
like
william
the
bloody
type
different
he
was
talking
to
someone
i
heard
through
the
door
he
was
having
this
conversation
and
then
he
started
singing
maybe
it's
another
musical
anya
buffy
glares
a
much
crappier
musical
he—he
mentioned
something
about
a
song
in
the
cellar
uh
aand
he
changed
there
too—i
mean
instantly
became
another
person
trigger
the
horse
no
in
his
head
it's
a
trigger
it's
a
brainwashing
term
it's
how
the
military
makes
sleeper
agents
theythey
brainwash
operatives
and
condition
them
with
a
specific
trigger
like
a
song
that
makes
'em
drastically
change
at
a
moment's
notice
is
this
left
over
from
your
days
in
the
army
no
this
is
left
over
from
every
army
movie
i've
ever
seen
but
it
makes
sense
we've
had
ghosts
or
something
haunting
us
right
well
what
if
spike's
ghosts
have
figured
out
a
way
to—not
only
haunt
him—what
if
they
figured
out
how
to—how
to
control
him
spike
said
he's
been
seeing
things
since
i
found
him
in
the
basement
so
he
gets
his
soul
back
he
starts
seeing
spooky
things
and
he
goes
extraextracrazy
this
trigger
how
do
we
holster—safety
or—i
don't
know
guns
how
do
we
make
it
stop
well
usually
the
operative
completes
his
task
and
either
blows
his
head
off
or
steals
a
submarine
all
right
i
need
information
if
spike's
a
bomb
then
i
need
to
know
how
to
diffuse
him
buffy
to
dawn
and
willow
you
two
i
wanna
know
what
did
this
to
him
spirits
ghosts
demons—check
the
lot
of
them
look
for
anything
that
could
haunt
oror
possibly
control

this

it
right
now
buffy

pulls

xander
has
this

that
you're
being
triggered
kill
me
buffy
turns
to
face
him
what
buffy
you
have
to
kill
me
you
don't
understand
when
i
left
the
room
earlier
i
heard
you
talking
to
someone—
do
you
have
any
idea
what
i'm
capable
of
i
was
in
the
cellar
with
you
i
saw
what
you
did
i'm
not
talking
about
the
cellar
the
people
in
the
cellar
got
off
easy
i'm
talking
about
me
buffy
you
have
never
met
the
real
me
buffy
crosses
arms
believe
me
i'm
well
aware
of
what
you're
capable
of
no
you
got
off
easy
too
spike
stands
do
you
know
how
much
blood
you
can
drink
from
a
girl
before
she'll
die
i
do
you
see
the
trick
is
to
drink
just
enough
to
know
how
to
damage
them
just
enough
so
that
they'll
still
cry
when
you—
spike
chokes
up
'cause
it's
not
worth
it
if
they
don't
cry
it's
not
your
fault
you're
not
the
one
doing
this
i
already
did
it
it's
already
done

then
steps
purposefully
toward
buffy
you
wanna
know
what
i've
done
to

this
is
me
buffy
you've
got
to
kill
me
before
i
get
out
we
can
keep
you
locked
up
keep
you
here
and
we'll
figure
out—
have
you
ever
really
asked
yourself
why
you
can't
do
it
off
me
after
everything
i've
done
to
you
to
people
around
you
it's
not
love
we
both
know
that
you
fought
by
my
side
you've
saved
lives
you've
helped—
don't
do
that
spike
rolls
eyes
don't
rationalize
this
into
some
noble
act
we
both
know
the
truth
of
it
spike
looks
down

away
you
like
men
who
hurt
you
no

job
to
be
the
slayer
no
i
don't
hate
like
that
not
you
or
myself
not
anymore
you
think
you
have
insight
now
because
your
soul's
drenched
in

so
instruments
of

a

with
a
leather
belt
spike
is
being
strapped
to
a
construct
made
of

beams
spikefirst
is
talking
to
him
while
a
robed
person
a
priest
of
the
first
also
known
as
a
harbinger
straps
spike
to
the
construct
you'll
have
to
excuse
the
spectacle
but
i've
always
been
a
bit
of
a
sucker
for
the
old
classics
first
spike
grins
wickedly
fondly
eyeing
spike's
predicament
spike
is
tied
to
the
wheellike
construct
with
all
four
corners
of
his
body
pulled
in
opposite
directions
a
harbinger
takes
out
a
knife
and
cuts
spike
with
it
spike
moans
in
excruciating
pain
oh
oh
don't
look
at
me
that
way
i
wanted
to
do
this
more
subtlelike
my
harbingers
have
a
tendency
to
call
attention
to
themselves
a
harbinger
cuts
spike
again
oh
first
spike
leans
forward
you're
the
one
who
couldn't
hold
his
end
of
the
bargain
you're
the
one
who
couldn't
take
care
of
what'shisname
you're
the
one
who
had
to
make
breakthroughs
and
learn
something
about
himself
a
harbinger
cuts
spike
again
oh
so
now
fittingly
you're
the
one
who
gets
to
do
the
honors
first
spike
crosses
arms
first
spike
morphs
into
buffy's
form
i
have
to
admit
i'm
glad
it
worked
out
this
way
i
was
going
to
bleed
andrew
but
first
buffy
sighs
you
look
a
lot
better
with
your
shirt
off
a
harbinger
cranks
a
wheel
attached
to
a
mechanism
that
hoists
the
wheel
spike's
tied
to
into
the
air
spike
is
now
hanging
from
the
wheel
about
ten
feet
from
the
ground
bleeding
steadily
from
his
ritualized
symbolshaped
cuts
to
be
honest
i'm
getting
a
little
tired
of
subtle
i
think
it's
about
time
we
brought
some
authority
to
our
presence
now
spike
wanna
see
what
a
real
vampire
looks
like
spike's
blood
is
falling
on
the
seal
of
danthazar
that's
right
below
him
it's
pooling
in
the
grooves
and
being
absorbed
into
the
seal
the
seal
starts
to
glow
one
by
one
the
pointed
tips
of
the
pentagram
at
its
center
fold
up
forming
a
pyramid
light
comes
out
from
under
it
the
pyramid
sinks
into
the
ground
the
remaining
pieces
of
the
seal
follow
suit
spike
glares
at
buffyfirst
then
watches
the
hole
where
the
seal
is
something
sticks
it's
withered
gray
pointyfingered
hand
out
of
the
hole
a
monster
climbs
out
wearing
black
leather
pan
up
to
show
its
horrible
disfigured
face
it's
bald
with
a
distinct
vampire
forehead
and
brows
and
trademark
fanged
teeth
it
looks
gaunt
with
extremely
hollow
cheekbones
it
raises
its
hands
toward
the
sky
and
looks
around
the
room
growling
menacingly
closing
