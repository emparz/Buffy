prologue

night
in
a
wood
near
sunnydale
the
full
moon
rises
slowly
above
the
trees
cut
into
the
wood
the
camera
moves
among
the
trees
and
bushes
low
to
the
ground
in
slow
motion
buffy
reads
from
'call
of
the
wild'
in
a
voiceover
'one
night
after
supper
the
lead
dog
turned
up
a
snowshoe
rabbit
the
dog
lay
down
low
to
the
race
his
body
flashing
forward
leap
by
leap'
cut
to
the
library
buffy's
voice
dissolves
into
that
of
willow
who
is
walking
around
the
area
by
the
cage
while
reading
from
the
book
'he
was
sounding
the
deeps
of
his
nature
and
the
parts
of
his
nature
that
were
deeper
than
he
going
back
into
the
wombs
of
time
the
rabbit
could
not'
suddenly
werewolf
oz
leaps
up
against
the
cage
door
and
rattles
it
at
her
she
startles
and
steps
back
okay
uh
maybe
we
should
try
a
less
stimulating
passage
she
flips
through
the
pages
of
the
book
while
oz
growls
at
her
and
settles
back
down
in
the
cage
xander
walks
into
the
library
carrying
a
thermos
and
a
couple
of
magazines
looking
very
tired
private
harris
reporting
for
oz
watch
willow
looks
up
from
the
book
xander
oh
good
xander
yawns
as
he
walks
up
to
her
and
takes
the
book
out
of
her
hands
oh
'call
of
the
wild'
aren't
we
reading
the
cliff
notes
to
this
for
english
some
of
us
are
willow
takes
back
the
book
anyway
it'll
help
you
stay
awake
it's
good
and
and
very
wolfy
willow
looks
at
oz
seems
to
soothe
the
savage
beast
she
takes
xander's
arm
and
leads
him
away
from
the
cage
toward
the
table
as
the
camera
pulls
back
with
them
the
towels
draped
across
most
of
the
cage
come
into
view
willow
quietly
except
for
the
parts
about
willow
whispers
rabbits
oz
hears
that
and
he
jumps
against
the
cage
banging
it
loudly
xander
and
willow
both
jump
and
look
back
at
him
xander
snags
the
book
rabbis
xander
looks
it
over
willow
takes
the
book
back
again
it
seems
to
make
him
a
little
overexcited
willow
puts
it
on
the
table
okay
now
he's
had
his
200
feeding
and
uh
after
sunrise
if
he
forgets
where
his
clothes
are
they're
on
top
of
the
file
cabinet
in
his
cage
willow
indicates
the
cage
i
put
those
towels
up
for
privacy
uh
no
worries
i
can
handle
the
oz
full
monty
xander
smirks
i
mean
not
'handle'
handle
like
'hands
to
flesh'
handle
willow
nods
mm
okay
willow
with
lots
of
nervous
gesturing
well
it's
not
for
you
it's
for
me
'cause
i'm
still
getting
used
to
half
a
monty
oh
good
xander
realizes
half
you
and
oz
which
half
willow
with
a
big
smile
wouldn't
you
like
to
know
anyway
he's
more
manageable
tonight
and
on
the
third
night
tomorrow
night
the
total
full
moon
that's
when
he's
a
real
wolfer
willow
reaches
across
the
table
but
in
case
there's
trouble
there
won't
be
but
if
she
holds
up
the
dart
rifle
xander
takes
it
from
her
with
his
right
hand
while
still
holding
his
things
with
his
left
and
slips
his
index
finger
into
the
trigger
guard
sleepy
time
gotcha
he
holds
the
stock
of
the
weapon
against
his
shoulder
thanks
again
for
doing
this
i
wouldn't
have
asked
but
i
have
this
test
no
big
you
can
count
on
me
xander
looks
at
his
things
i
got
my
coffee
magazines
figured
i'd
read
maybe
xander
points
with
the
gun
run
the
stairs
over
there
a
little
bit
xander
chuckles
i'm
good
willow
isn't
thrilled
with
the
way
he's
handling
the
rifle
and
so
takes
it
out
of
his
hand
giving
him
a
nervous
smile
she
sets
it
down
on
the
table
gives
him
a
little
wave
goodbye
and
starts
out
on
the
way
past
the
cage
she
gives
werewolf
oz
a
little
wave
too
bye
oz
raises
his
head
and
growls
as
he
watches
her
go
xander
picks
the
book
up
from
the
table
inspects
the
cover
and
looks
up
at
oz
he
decides
to
make
things
easy
on
himself
he
climbs
onto
the
table
sets
the
book
down
at
one
end
and
lies
on
his
stomach
using
the
book
as
a
pillow
he
smiles
as
he
settles
himself
for
a
relaxing
nap
in
the
cage
oz
lets
out
a
loud
growl
cut
to
the
cemetery
faith
and
buffy
are
strolling
through
on
patrol
nice
place
do
you
ever
catch
kids
doing
the
diddy
out
here
no
there's
a
smooch
spot
up
by
the
woods
that's
usually
where
kids
go
yeah
bet
you
and
scott
have
been
up
there
kicking
the
gearshift
faith
grins
buffy
gives
her
a
look
hardly
only
been
on
a
few
dates
but
you
like
him
and
when
you
think
about
him
you
get
that
faith
inhales
good
downlow
tickle
right
buffy
smiles
yeah
i
guess
but
buffy
realizes
what
she
may
have
meant
and
gives
her
the
eye
how
low
faith
grins
broadly
you
tell
me
how
about
not
buffy
looks
around
dreamily
but
he
is
buffy
sighs
nice
and
he's
funny
and
quite
a
muffin
she
gives
buffy
a
smile
buffy
smiles
back
blueberry
that
crunchy
munchy
stuff
on
top
but
my
most
favorite
thing
so
far
buffy
sighs
is
that
he
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
kind
of
hell
beast
all
men
are
beasts
buffy
okay
i
was
hoping
to
not
get
that
cynical
till
i
was
at
least
forty
it's
not
cynical
i
mean
it's
realistic
every
guy
from
manimal
down
to
mr
ilovetheenglishpatient
has
beast
in
him
and
i
don't
care
how
sensitive
they
act
they're
all
still
just
in
it
for
the
chase
buffy
has
to
tacitly
admit
that
faith
may
have
a
point
cut
to
the
woods
a
boy
runs
through
the
bushes
in
a
panic
the
camera
chases
him
and
a
creature's
growling
and
heavy
breath
can
be
heard
the
boy
looks
back
to
check
on
his
pursuer
and
trips
over
a
low
branch
he
rolls
onto
his
back
and
tries
to
push
himself
away
with
his
feet
but
whatever
is
chasing
him
is
quickly
on
top
of
him
and
drags
him
away
the
boy
screams
loudly
as
he
disappears
from
the
camera's
view
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

sunnydale
high
school
willow
oz
and
buffy
climb
the
outside
stairs
from
the
quad
up
to
the
balcony
i
don't
think
that's
true
that
every
guy
is
in
it
only
for
the
chase
i
know
it
is
an
awful
generalization
hey
buffy
she
looks
along
the
balcony
to
see
him
approaching
at
a
quick
pace
willow
gives
oz
a
smile
that's
what
i
stopped
you
for
basically
hey
okay
buffy
smiles
hey
scott's
friends
debbie
and
pete
approach
the
group
oz
notices
them
and
holds
up
his
hand
in
greeting
debbie

holding
a
bouquet
of
flowers
how

debbie

hard

the
marching
we
have
a
marching
jazz
band
buffy
looks
at
scott
inquisitively
yeah

best
jazz

all
directions

into
floats

willow
smiles
at
everyone

in
mind

most
likely
there
there

is
no
deal

stops
and
looks
at
xander
but
um
if
if

a
deal

the

into
the
cage
and
the
window
unbreakable
and
xander
looks
up
at
the
window

he
points
up
at
it
as
he
comes
back
out
of
the
cage
willow
upset
oh
god
giles
and
oz
both
go
over
to
check
the
window
too
not
to
freak
i
rested
my
eyes
now
and
then
that's
all
willow
gives
him
a
betrayed
look
giles
looks
down
from
the
window
how
long
exactly
did
you
rest
your
eyes
for
glares
at
him
oz
just
stares
into
space
turning
the
implications
over
in
his
mind
a
little
now
uh
a
little
then
but
i
never
heard
oz
leave
and
he
was
here
in
the
morning
when
i
um
xander
searches
for
words
when
i
giles
angrily
woke
up
you
could
put
it
that
way
if
you
want
to
mr
technical
oz
walks
over
to
willow
looking
at
her
sadly
oh
god
she
takes
his
hand
to
comfort
him
he
looks
at
giles
imploringly
cut
to
the
school
psychologist's
office
the
door
opens
and
buffy
enters
she
closes
it
behind
herself
and
steps
up
to
the
desk
mr
platt
is
sitting
in
his
chair
facing
away
looking
out
the
window
while
his
everpresent
cigarette
smolders
in
his
fingers
two
o'clock
miss
summers
he
makes
no
move
to
turn
around
to
face
her
buffy
smiles
buffy
summers
reporting
for
sanity
her
smiles
fades
when
she
realizes
he
still
isn't
going
to
turn
around
instead
he
just
blows
out
a
huge
cloud
of
cigarette
smoke
look
i
know
that
i
have
to
do
this
and
ii'll
cooperate
and
i'll
look
at
your
ink
blots
and
everything
but
i
don't
wanna
talk
about
my
life
or
my
childhood
or
anything
for
that
matter
actually
and
uh
i
don't
wanna

mr
platt
finally
turns
we're
not
gonna
be
friends
mr
platt
smiles
at
her

i
hope
mr
platt
waves
his
hand
at
her
friends
are
a
good
thing
mr
platt
takes
another
drag
from
his
cigarette
mmhm

with
you

his
desk
drawer

not
what
you
need
right
now

out
a
can
of
deodorizer
what
you
need
is
a
trained
not
too
crazy
professional
who
will
always
give
you
his
honest
opinion
he
pops
the
top
off
of
the
aerosol
can
and
gives
a
couple
of
sprays
around
himself
buffy
just
gives
him
an
odd
look
and
says
nothing
which
i
offer
he
looks
back
at
her
for
a
moment
before
gesturing
to
a
chair
have
a
seat
he
caps
the
can
and
puts
it
away
as
she
sits
in
the
chair
not
too
crazy
those
are
your
credentials
he
stands
up
and
starts
to
walk
around
his
desk
look
buffy
any
person
grownup
shrink
mr
platt
sits
on
his
desk
pope
any
person
who
claims
to
be
totally
sane
is
either
lying
or
not
very
bright
i
mean
everyone
has
problems
everybody
has
demons
right
buffy
averts
her
eyes
gotta
say
i'm
with
you
on
that
buffy
looks
down
at
her
hands
excellent
so
the
hope
i
bring
you
is
demons
can
be
fought
mr
platt
buffy
looks
up
at
him
in
surprise
people
can
change
you
can
change
now
your
turn
mr
platt
crosses
his
arms
let's
start
with
why
you
ran
away
she
looks
up
for
a
moment
then
begins
to
fidget
and
lean
back
in
her
seat
buffy
smiles
weakly
that's
a
long
story
mm
mr
platt
shrugs
bore
me
you
know
i'm
i'm
really
over
it
ii'm
moving
on
i
feel
good
i'm
i'm
even
dating
someone
new
all
good
things
mr
platt
gestures
widely
with
his
arms
but
still
you're
mr
platt
inhales
and
leans
back
you're
bringing
me
in
at
the
end
of
the
movie
buffy
awkwardly
i
was
dating
someone
uh
itit
ended
badly
my
mom
and
i
were
fighting
and
i
kinda
freaked
well
tell
me
more
about
this
guy
the
bad
ending
guy
she
looks
up
at
him
for
a
long
moment
before
letting
out
a
breath
and
looking
down
at
her
hands
again
he
was
my
first
i
loved
him
and
then
he
changed
she
looks
up
at
him
surprised
again
yeah
he
got
mean
yes
and
you
didn't
stop
loving
him
buffy
doesn't
know
what
to
add
or
how
to
respond
look
lots
of
people
lose
themselves
in
love
it's
it's
no
shame
they
write
songs
about
it
the
hitch
is
you
can't
stay
lost
sooner
or
later
you
you
have
to
get
back
to
yourself
buffy
considers
and
if
you
can't
if
you
can't
mr
platt
inhales
well
love
becomes
your
master
and
you're
just
its
dog
she
didn't
expect
to
hear
it
put
quite
that
way
cut
to
the
library
buffy
comes
in
and
finds
giles
pacing
and
everyone
else
sitting
on
the
steps
and
looking
gloomy
she
sets
her
bag
on
the
table
i'm
afraid
to
ask
buffy
crosses
her
arms
oz
ate
someone
last
night
willow
glares
he
did
not
xander
annoyed
oz
does
not
eat
people
xander
cordelia
rolls
her
eyes
it's
more
werewolf
play
xander
buffy
looks
at
giles
inquiringly
you
know
i
bat
you
around
a
little
bit
like
a
cat
toy
i
have
harmless
wolf
fun
is
it
oz's
fault
that
oz
lowers
his
head
you
know
side
effect
people
get
cut
to
ribbons
and
maybe
then
he'll
take
a
little
nibble
and
willow
gives
him
a
hurt
look
i'm
not
helping
am
i
no
oz
may
have
got
out
of
his
cage
last
night
or
maybe
there's
a
another
werewolf
roaming
the
woods
perhaps
perhaps
it's
something
else
entirely
it's
okay
we'll
work
together
and
we'll
figure
this
out
yes
um
giles
thinks
buffy
uh
you
uh
you
patrol
the
woods
uh
the
others
um
check
out
the
morgue
willow
hopeful
right
we
can
see
if
it's
a
werewolf
kill
or
not
willow
glances
at
oz
next
to
her
but
what
about
oz
um
well
i
have
some
research
materials
at
home
i
need
to
look
up
uh
wwwe
could
ask
faith
to
watch
over
him
buffy
nods
and
looks
at
oz
oz
looks
up
at
giles
what
you're
having
a
slayer
watch
me
oh
good
we're
not
overreacting
he
gets
up
to
leave
not
willing
to
listen
to
any
more
of
this
willow
gives
buffy
a
concerned
look
and
gets
up
to
go
after
him
she
reaches
out
and
touches
him
on
the
shoulder
he
stops
and
turns
to
face
her
she
tries
to
give
him
a
reassuring
smile
okay
uh
you
know
that
thing
where
you
bail
in
the
middle
of
an
upsetting
conversation
oz
inhales
i
have
to
do
that
oz
exhales
it's
kinda
dramatic
i
know
but
sometimes
it's
a
necessary
guy
thing
and
i
want
you
to
do
the
guy
thing
but
she
glances
and
gestures
at
the
clock
on
the
wall
and
sighs
oz
looks
over
at
it
too
5
34pm
almost
sunset
he
looks
back
at
her
and
the
others
realizing
this
isn't
the
time
to
do
the
guy
thing
and
lets
out
a
heavy
sigh
he
looks
over
at
the
cage
and
reluctantly
goes
to
lock
himself
up
willow
follows
him
the
door
squeaks
when
he
pulls
it
open
and
again
as
he
pulls
it
closed
it
locks
shut
with
a
clang
oz
oz
unwilling
to
look
at
her
get
away
from
the
cage
willow
confused
by
his
tone
of
voice
what
oz
still
not
looking
at
her
it's
gonna
happen
soon
willow
still
won't
go
get
away
from
me
he
turns
his
back
to
her
willow
is
hurt
and
confused
by
his
behavior
cut
to
the
woods
later
that
night
buffy
patrols
through
them
by
herself
looking
around
and
listening
carefully
the
camera
watches
her
from
behind
some
branches
a
figure
quickly
and
silently
slips
in
front
of
the
camera
buffy
thinks
she
heard
something
and
raises
her
stake
again
a
figure
dashes
by
and
this
time
buffy
sees
it
she
runs
after
it
through
the
bushes
suddenly
she
stops
in
her
tracks
when
she
sees
it
come
straight
for
her
she
stares
in
disbelief
as
the
man
rushes
her
and
knocks
her
down
as
he
runs
by
buffy
steadies
herself
on
the
ground
and
looks
up
as
he
goes
he
stops
and
looks
back
at
her
it's
angel
and
he
growls
and
snarls
at
her
there
is
blood
around
his
mouth
but
he
has
on
his
human
face
not
his
vampire's
she
can
only
stare
at
him
in
complete
surprise
part
2

in
the
woods
angel
continues
to
growl
at
buffy
he
charges
her
as
she
gets
up
she
grabs
him
and
throws
him
to
the
ground
but
also
falls
under
his
weight
angel
rolls
to
a
stop
and
crawls
quickly
back
to
her
before
she
can
get
back
up
he
lunges
at
her
and
she
uses
his
momentum
to
flip
him
over
herself
and
onto
his
back
she
rises
to
one
knee
and
punches
him
as
he
tries
to
regain
his
footing
he
takes
the
blow
in
the
head
but
just
spins
around
and
delivers
a
solid
backhand
punch
to
her
face
making
her
fall
onto
her
back
angel
jumps
on
her
again
but
she
uses
her
leverage
to
send
him
onto
his
back
once
again
he
twists
his
body
reaches
over
and
punches
her
in
the
gut
she
quickly
rolls
away
and
gets
to
a
standing
position
she
does
a
full
spinning
low
hook
kick
hitting
him
in
the
head
as
he
tries
to
stand
he
slumps
down
on
all
fours
and
as
he
looks
up
at
her
she
punches
him
solidly
in
the
face
making
him
slump
to
the
ground
badly
beaten
after
a
few
breaths
he
loses
consciousness
and
his
body
relaxes
buffy
breathes
hard
as
she
looks
down
at
him
still
not
believing
what
she
sees
cut
to
the
morgue
a
flashlight
shines
into
a
room
where
several
bodies
are
lying
on
gurneys
cut
to
an
adjacent
room
willow
comes
in
and
shines
her
flashlight
on
the
closed
body
drawers
along
a
wall
she
finds
the
one
she
wants
and
opens
it
she
pulls
out
the
drawer
and
lifts
the
plastic
sheet
away
from
jeff
orkin's
face
she
sets
her
metal
scoobydoo
lunch
box
on
his
chest
and
opens
it
behind
her
xander
approaches
she
pulls
out
a
plastic
bag
and
a
pair
of
tweezers
when
xander
reaches
her
he
takes
one
look
at
the
body
and
nearly
vomits
oh
god
he
bends
over
holding
his
mouth
trying
to
hold
it
back
willow
just
hands
him
the
flashlight
here
hold
this
he
doesn't
hold
it
very
steadily
and
willow
tries
to
adjust
his
arm
as
she
would
an
unruly
desk
lamp
she
takes
jeff's
hand
and
tries
to
get
a
look
at
his
fingers
suddenly
xander
spins
around
and
shines
the
flashlight
into
cordelia's
face
aah
god
willow
just
reaches
for
xander's
hand
again
and
pulls
it
around
to
shine
the
light
where
she
needs
it
it's
not
working
out
very
well
xander
to
cordelia
we're
doing
crime
here
you
don't
sneak
up
during
crime
he
finally
gives
willow
his
attention
again
and
holds
the
light
steady
god
have
a
cordelia
gets
a
look
at
jeff's
mauled
body
okay
cordelia
covers
her
face
scarred
for
life
oh
god
willow
just
calmly
goes
about
getting
some
samples
from
under
jeff's
fingernails
willow
how
can
you
stand
it
yeah
will
i
mean
this
guy
is
pretty
barfworthy
can't
we
be
elsewhere
like
you
know
is
oz
cleared
or
what
huh
she's
finished
with
jeff's
hand
and
puts
it
back
under
the
plastic
she
moves
the
flashlight
in
xander's
hand
around
and
inspects
the
rest
of
the
body
i'm
not
sure
i
mean
there
are
a
lot
of
incised
wounds
but
they
could
be
from
anything
anything
with
big
sharp
teeth
and
vicious
xander
interrupts
do
you
wanna
go
back
to
the
car
and
wait
willow
starts
to
pick
at
jeff's
chest
with
the
tweezers
cordelia
stares
taken
aback
no
god
i'm
just
saying
almost
done
lemme
just
get
a
few
stray
hairs
from
the
body
they
could
be
from
the
attacker
cordelia
holds
her
nose
against
the
stench
great
so
we
got
everything
we
need
yep
that's
it
she
drops
the
tweezers
and
faints
dead
away
falling
back
into
xander
he
quickly
gets
an
arm
under
her
as
she
goes
down
and
they
all
sink
to
the
floor
oh
okay
uh
little
too
much
excitement
for
the
wilster
here
he
steadies
willow's
head
against
his
chest
so
it
doesn't
flop
around
doesn't
look
good
for
oz
does
it
it
really
doesn't
cordelia
they
look
up
at
jeff
this
guy
was
ripped
apart
by
a
big
wild
animal
cut
to
the
mansion
buffy
finds
drusilla's
trunk
and
knocks
miss
edith
and
the
other
dolls
from
it
she
throws
open
the
lid
and
dumps
the
contents
out
onto
the
floor
there
she
finds
a
heavy
chain
and
shackles
back
in
the
main
room
she
throws
one
end
over
an
iron
bracket
holding
up
the
high
marble
fireplace
mantel
and
locks
the
shackles
on
angel's
wrists
she
steps
back
as
he
lies
unconscious
on
the
floor
with
one
arm
held
high
by
the
chain
he
wakes
up
and
gets
to
his
knees
suddenly
he
lashes
out
at
her
but
she
jumps
back
in
time
and
he
misses
he
leans
against
his
bonds
and
growls
at
buffy
then
crouches
down
and
cowers
like
a
trapped
animal
she
walks
around
him
in
a
wide
arc
and
stops
when
she
notices
the
place
where
he
fell
from
the
dimensional
portal
there
is
a
silhouette
of
him
on
the
floor
surrounded
by
scorch
marks
from
the
intense
light
angel
continues
to
growl
and
struggle
with
the
chain
buffy
cringes
to
see
him
like
this
she
kneels
down
by
the
silhouette
for
a
closer
look
angel
makes
another
attempt
to
grab
her
and
she
jerks
back
but
he's
too
far
away
to
do
any
harm
she
looks
back
down
at
the
scorch
marks
and
winces
at
the
sound
of
angel
struggling
behind
her
he
soon
stops
and
slumps
to
the
floor
with
one
arm
raised
high
by
the
chain
cut
to
the
library
werewolf
oz
growls
in
his
cage
faith
is
oblivious
as
she
moves
around
to
the
sounds
of
mark
ferrari
on
her
portable
cd
player
buffy
comes
in
behind
her
and
taps
her
on
the
shoulder
instinctively
faith
spins
around
and
lands
a
swinging
backhand
punch
to
buffy's
face
oh
she
stumbles
backward
and
steadies
herself
against
the
portable
card
catalog
oh
uh
buffy
are
you
okay
what
are
you
doing
here
buffy
holds
her
jaw
uh
bleeding
internally
but
i'll
live
god
i'm
sorry
faith
shrugs
with
the
cd
player
i
guess
i
didn't
hear
you
figured
as
much
ow
again
buffy
takes
a
breath
and
arches
her
back
uh
actually
iii
came
to
give
you
the
rest
of
the
night
off
get
out
of
jail
free
huh
how
come
buffy
shrugs
couldn't
sleep
buffy
takes
off
her
jacket
figured
i'd
uh
cram
for
my
french
test
that's
cool
i
was
going
kinda
crazy
in
here
but
i
can
get
in
a
few
stakings
before
sunrise
she
heads
for
the
door
handing
buffy
the
keys
to
the
cage
on
the
way
buffy
follows
her
with
her
gaze
knock
yourself
out
not
literally
though
yeah
later
the
door
can
be
heard
closing
behind
her
buffy
looks
at
oz
for
a
moment
then
turns
her
attention
to
the
card
catalog
she
sets
the
keys
on
it
pulls
out
the
first
drawer
and
begins
to
search
through
them
cut
to
morning
sunlight
pours
in
through
the
cage
window
and
down
on
oz
lying
there
naked
the
camera
pans
up
to
giles
arriving
with
a
cup
of
coffee
in
his
hand
he
looks
down
at
oz
to
make
sure
he's
not
a
wolf
unlocks
the
door
and
pulls
it
slightly
open
he
takes
a
sip
from
his
cup
and
heads
over
to
where
he
sees
buffy
in
the
stacks
curled
up
and
asleep
in
a
chair
with
a
book
on
her
lap
and
a
drawer
from
the
card
catalog
next
to
her
on
a
stepstool
other
books
are
lying
on
the
floor
around
her
he
quietly
takes
the
steps
to
the
upper
level
and
reaches
down
for
one
of
the
books
as
he
does
so
buffy
stirs
from
her
slumber
and
looks
up
at
him
hey
hmm
hello
giles
sips
his
coffee
buffy
quickly
realizes
what
it
must
look
like
her
surrounded
by
all
these
books
and
tries
to
play
it
off
oh
boy
buffy
stands
up
faith
and
her
nutty
books
giles
reads
some
book
titles
'exploring
demon
dimensions'
and
'mystery
of
acathla'
yeah
and
she
still
listens
to
heavy
metal
buffy
walks
toward
the
stairs
freaky
deaky
buffy
she
realizes
that
he
hasn't
bought
it
and
leans
against
the
railing
he
gives
her
his
attention
and
slowly
comes
over
to
her
as
she
speaks
what
if
i
told
you
that
i
had
a
dream
about
angel
and
um
it
brought
up
some
questions
i'd
say
it
was
to
be
expected
must
have
been
some
dream
i
didn't
think
you
knew
what
a
card
index
was
for
giles
sips
his
coffee
i
dreamt
that
he
came
back
she
sits
down
on
the
steps
giles
comes
down
to
sit
with
her
of
course
after
jenny
was
killed
giles
sets
the
cup
aside
i
had
dreams
that
she
was
sstill
alive
that
i
saved
her
this
was
vivid
really
vivid
threedimensional
sensurround
the
hills
are
alive
she
stops
when
she
realizes
her
use
of
jenny's
metaphor
giles
takes
off
his
glasses
and
considers
for
a
moment
do
you
believe
it
was
a
prophecy
no
ii
don't
know
i
buffy
inhales
deeply
i
guess
it
just
it
made
me
wonder
giles
looks
away
in
thought
is
there
a
chance
even
could
it
happen
well
there's
no
record
of
anyone
returning
from
a
demon
dimension
once
the
gate
was
closed
iii
can't
imagine
how
it
could
happen
oror
why
let's
just
pretend
for
a
second
that
angel
somehow
found
his
way
back
to
sunnydale
what
would
he
be
like
i
really
can't
say
from
what
is
known
about
that
dimension
i
it
would
suggest
a
world
of
brutal
torment
and
time
moves
quite
differently
there
so
i
remember
so
he
would've
been
down
there
for
hundreds
of
years
yes
giles
looks
up
at
her
of
torture
it
would
take
someone
of
extraordinary
will
and
character
to
survive
that
and
uh
retain
any
semblance
of
self
giles
swallows
hard
most
likely
he'd
be
be
a
monster
buffy
hopelessly
a
lost
cause
maybe
maybe
not
in
my
experience
there
are
two
types
of
monster
the
first
uh
can
be
redeemed
or
more
importantly
wants
to
be
redeemed
and
the
second
type
the
second
is
void
of
humanity
cannot
respond
to
reason
or
love
willow
shows
up
unexpectedly
bringing
a
box
of
donuts
with
her
i
thought
faith
was
on
duty
oh
hey
change
of
plans
buffy
comes
down
to
her
glazed
or
cake
willow
smiles
it's
fun
to
watch
them
make
them
willow
gestures
they
use
this
spritzy
thing
and
they
drop
the
batter
into
this
couldn't
sleep
huh
willow
sighs
i've
been
at
mister
donut
since
the
tv

snowy
thing
behind
her
oz
has
dressed
and
comes
out
of

coldblooded

behind

with
wide
eyes
oz
slips
on
his
outer
shirt
and
comes
up
next
to
her
jelly
doughnut
willow
offers
the
box
oz
ignores
the
donuts
everything
all
right

body
willow
smiles
avoiding
the
issue

delicious
willow
come

it
werewolf
willow
sets
the
box
down
on
the
table
her
expression
shows
that
she's
not
overly
anxious
to
say

a
vampire
iit
wasn't
conclusive
how
could
it
not
be
conclusive
what
did
it
look
like

he
bit
let
her
finish
buffy
buffy
looks
back
at
him
no
it's
just
she
realizes
the
sensitivity
of
the
issue
with
oz
standing
right
there
i'm
sorry
she
sits
down
giles
just
calmly
waits
for
willow
to
finish
her
report
cut
to
the
cafeteria
buffy
has
a
plate
of
various
flavors
of
jello
and
looks
for
a
place

giggle

weak
smile

him
on
the
shoulder
as
she
walks
around
him
on
the
way
out
leaving
her
jello
behind

briefly
with
their
gazes

the
manicdepressive
chick
scott
isn't
too
pleased
with
that
comment
cut
to
the
hall
buffy
comes
out
of
the
cafeteria
and
pauses
for
a
moment
to
reflect
on
pete's
comment
before
continuing
down
the
hall
cut
to
the
mansion
buffy
comes
in
through
the
heavy
drapes
hanging
across
the
side
entrance
angel
crouches
against
the
wall
whimpering
buffy
stops
at
the
wall
opposite
him
and
looks
at
him
suffering
slowly
she
comes
toward
him
angel
just
remains
hunched
over
in
his
crouch
not
looking
up
or
giving
any
indication
that
he
knows
she's
there
angel
he
doesn't
seem
to
hear
her
do
you
understand
me
still
nothing
from
him
she
comes
even
closer
the
tattoo
on
his
back
beckons
to
her
slowly
she
reaches
out
and
touches
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
he
suddenly
and
very
violently
lashes
out
at
her
and
roars
she
instantly
takes
several
steps
backward
away
from
him
he
goes
back
to
his
pathetic
whimpering
buffy
looks
at
him
terribly
hurt
and
rushes
from
the
mansion
angel
growls
deeply
at
her
above
him
the
mantel
bracket
begins
to
loosen
dust
falls
from
the
stone
as
he
pulls
against
the
chain
cut
to
the
school
cut
to
pete
and
debbie
walking
along
a
back
hall
debbie
come
on
just
for
a
minute
he
takes
both
of
her
hands
and
tries
to
nudge
her
against
the
wall
but
she
evades
him
and
pulls
away
no
i
can't
i
have
to
meet
a
friend
he
pulls
her
back
to
him
by
both
wrists
so
you'll
be
late
but
happy
he
kisses
her
and
reaches
behind
him
with
one
hand
to
open
a
door
he
backs
into
the
dark
supply
room
pulling
her
in
with
him
debbie
giggles
and
once
inside
he
pulls
her
close
and
they
embrace
and
kiss
passionately
pete
breaks
off
the
kiss
and
backs
away
toward
a
shelf
no
no
let's
stay
here
relax
debbie
what's
wrong
with
you
today
he
takes
her
in
his
arms
again
and
kisses
her
some
more
after
a
moment
he
notices
an
empty
jar
on
the
shelf
all
that's
left
in
it
is
the
last
few
drops
of
a
green
fluorescent
fluid
what
is
that
she
turns
his
face
to
hers
and
tries
to
kiss
him
again
debbie
giggles
nothing

me
debbie
kisses
him
no
debbie
you
did
not
drink
that
did
you
debbie
looks
at
the
jar

it
debbie
giggles
you
know
i
didn't
pete
looks
intensely
at
her
debbie
what's
going
on
her
giddiness
fades
and
she
looks
back
nervously
cut
to
mr
platt's
office
buffy
opens
the
door
comes
in
and
closes
it
behind
her
she
finds
him
turned
away
again
looking
out
of
the
window
his
signature
cigarette
smoldering
between
his
fingers
two
o'clock
buffy
summers
right
she
fears
he'll
turn
around
again
and
although
he
can't
see
her
she
extends
her
arm
in
a
gesture
to
stop
him
wait
don't
turn
around
buffy
realizes
her
useless
gesture
okay
and
don't
say
anything
buffy
clutches
her
jacket
just
listen
buffy
begins
to
pace
and
breathe
nervously
i
mean
that's
that's
your
thing
right
she
stops
pacing
and
stands
behind
a
chair
shifting
her
weight
from
leg
to
leg
and
fidgeting
with
her
jacket
against
the
chair's
backrest
there's
something
going
on
buffy
her
voice
shakes
i
mean
ththis
whole
entire
story
is
probably
gonna
convince
you
that
i'm
loonybin
material
but
buffy
shrugs
there's
nobody
else
that
i
can
talk
to
buffy
inhales
nervously
not
willow
and
not
giles
nobody
buffy
starts
to
pace
again
if
they
if
they
found
out
they'd
freak
on
me
or
they'd
do
something
and
buffy
stops
and
faces
him
i
need
help
i
just
i
need
to
talk
to
someone
buffy
takes
a
few
breaths
i'm
so
scared
buffy
sheds
a
tear
it's
this
guy
steps
up
to
the
desk
hhhe
she
notices
his
cigarette
now
it's
burned
completely
down
to
the
filter
not
once
having
had
the
ashes
tapped
off
she
realizes
that
something
is
very
wrong
he's
come
back
the
camera
pans
over
from
her
to
mr
platt
sitting
dead
in
his
chair

been
severely
mauled

the
supply
room

is
seething
with
anger
he
goes
over
to
the
empty
bottle
and
picks
it
up
so
the
bottle
just
pete
faces
debbie
jumped
out
of
the
cabinet
and
spilled
on

down
and
throws
it
to
the
floor
breaking

and
you
wanna

why
he
grabs
her
by
the
arms
she
whimpers
in
fright
you
wanna

why
because
all
it
takes
now
is
you
debbie
pete
grits
his
teeth
you
and
your
stupid
grating
voice
his
neck
muscles
suddenly
become
tense
and
he
yells
out
in
pain
he
grunts
as
his
head
jerks
back
and
forth
and
the
skin
on
his
face
and
neck
begins
to
thicken
and
the
veins
bulge
out
he
screams
as
his
head
whips
around
violently
debbie
watches
in
terror
with
a
final
scream
his
transformation
to
his
alter
ego
is
complete
his
face
is
mottled
and
grotesquely
misshapen
debbie
is
too
frightened
to
even
breathe
pete
shakes
her
by
the
arms
pete
angrily
you're
the
reason
i
started
the
formulas
in
the
first
place
to
be
the
man
you
wanted
and
you
pay
me
back
how
pete
debbie
sobs
in
fear
by
whoring
around
with
other
guys
and
taunting
me
no
i
don't
i
don't
even
look
pete
backhand
punches
her
in
the
face
and
shoves
her
to
the
floor
she
gets
to
her
hands
and
knees
and
crawls
around
to
face
him
slowly
she
stands
back
up
is
that
something
your
shrink
taught
you
debbie
huh
huh
to
share
pete
approaches
her
to
communicate
to
piss
me
off
he
swings
another
backhand
punch
at
her
and
she
falls
to
the
floor
again
this
time
she
stays
down
and
cowers
well
guess
what
even
he's
not
going
to
listen
to
your
pathetic
ramblings
anymore
pete
she
looks
up
at
him
frightened
i'm
all
you've
got
now
debbie
do
you
hear
me
pete
points
at
her
i
am
all
you've
got
she
looks
up
at
him
very
afraid
and
pushes
herself
up
against
a
crate
pete
suddenly
realizes
what
he's
doing
and
calms
down
a
bit
he
looks
down
at
his
gnarled
hands
then
back
at
debbie
oh
my
god
he
has
calmed
enough
now
that
he
changes
back
to
his
regular
self
he
sees
her
sobbing
and
looks
at
her
remorsefully
he
quickly
gets
down
and
kneels
by
her
pete
whispering
hey
debbie
pete
she
turns
away
hey
listen
pete
quietly
you
know
you

make
me

takes
her
head
in
his
hands
and
turns
her
to
face
him
debbie

all
right
he
kisses
her
forehead
she
responds
and
puts
her
arms
around
his
head
she
strokes
his
hair
as
they
hold
each
other
tightly
it's
okay
she
keeps
petting
him
gently
her
own
breathing
becoming
calmer
it's
okay
cut

the
library
giles
paces

talks
while
buffy

especially
brutal

phrase
coined
by
the
coroner
when
describing
mr
platt
was
'pureed'
but
he
did
confirm
that
platt
was
killed
shortly
before
buffy
found
him
which
means
that
he
was
killed
during
the
day

a
depraved
sadistic
animal
oz
comes
in

up
and
goes
over
to
him
pushing
giles
aside
in
her
eagerness
to
reach
him

a
coldblooded
jelly

an
instant
buffy
exhales
he

immediately
he
and
buffy

in
the
cage
cut
to
the
girls'
locker
room

is
trying
to
hide
her
black
eye
with
makeup
the
door
opens
behind
her
and
buffy
and
willow
enter
debbie
just
keeps
on
applying
makeup
it's
tricky
covering
a
fresh
shiner
like
that
you
know
what
works
what
debbie
puts
away
her
makeup
don't
get
hit
she

debbie
i'll
bet
the
farm
you

debbie
looks
at

takes
a
few
steps
away
debbie
turns
around
to

seething
with
anger

pete
screams
as
his
head
whips
around
and

transforms
into
his
alter
ego
again
he
looks
at
oz
with
murder
in
his
eyes
when
the
change
is
complete
oz
