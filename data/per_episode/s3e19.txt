free
ride
young

you

i'm

sorry

mayor
faith
takes

stress
this
enough
something
crucially
important
to
my
ascension

with
an
intricate
design
this
is
a
thing
of
beauty
boss

it
cost
a
pretty
penny
so
you
just
take
good
care
of
it
and
you

somebody's
eye
out
with
that
thing
until

academia
there
that's
where
they
make
gileses
i

i
could
learn

mix
happy

i'm

it
scores
kinda
high

face
of
the
planet
as
in

i
rub
it
oxford
whoopee
four
years
in

central
sounds
thrilling
and
mit
is
a
clearasil
ad
with
housing
and
yale
is
a
dumping
ground
for
those
who
didn't
get
into
harvard
i
got
into
harvard
any
clue
on
what
college
you
might
be
attending
so
we
can
start
calculating
minimum
safe
distance
none
of
your
business
certainly
nowhere

you
losers
okay
you
guys
don't
forget
to
breathe

i'm
sorry
buffy

who
actually
have
a

cordelia
leaves
an
angry
young

oh
buffy
she
was
just
being
cordelia
only
more
so
don't
pay
any
attention
to
her
she's
definitely
got
a
chip
going
maybe
if
you
didn't
goad
her

now
no
not
now
after
i
graduate
you
know
college
but
you're
a
slayer
yeah
i'm
also
a
person
you
can't
just
define
me
by
my
slayerness
that's
somethingism
giles
is
listening
from
the
door
of
his
office
buffy
i
know
we've
talked
about
you
going
away
i
got
into
northwestern
that's
wonderful
news
good
for
you
alright
everyone
monsters
demons
world
in
peril
i
bet
you
they
have
all
that
stuff
in

you
cannot
leave
sunnydale
by
the
power
invested
in
me
by
the
council
i
forbid
it

said
while
crossing
his
wrists
over
his
heart
watcher
authority
hand
signal
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
and
turns
her
back
on
wesley
ah
yes
that
should
settle
it
wesley
counting
on
fingers
faith
gone
bad
and
the
mayor's
ascension
coming
up

i
know
it's
complicated
i'm
aware
that
my
graduation
may
be
among
other
things
posthumous
but
what
if
i
stop
the
ascension
what
if
i
capture
faith
i
very
much
hope
you
will
if
i
do
that
then
all
you
guys
have
to
do
is
keep
the
runofthemill
unholy
forces
at
bay
through
midterms
and
i'll
be
back
in
time
for
homecoming
and
every
school
break
after
that
can
we
at
least
think
about
it
perhaps
if
circumstances
were
different
i'll
make
them
different
what
i'm
tired
of
waiting
for
mayor
mcsleaze
to
make
his
move
while
we
sit
on
our
hands
counting
down
to
ascension
day
i
mean
let's
take
the
fight
to
him
no
no
much
too
reckless
we're
at
a
distinct
disadvantage
we
don't
know
anything
about
the
mayor's
ascension
she's
right
time's
running
out
we
need
to
take
the
offensive
giles
to
buffy
what's
your
plan
i
gotta
have
a
plan
really
i
can't
just
be
proactive
with
pep
no
you
want
to
take
the
fight
to
them
i
suggest
the
first
step
would
be
to
find
out
exactly
what
they're
up
to
oh
i
actually
knew
that
i
thought
you
meant
a
more
specific
plan
you
know
like
with

and
stuff
great
we'll
find
out
what
they're
up

buffy
sits
at

looking

xander
and
wesley
look
on
the

of

it
houses
some
great
demonic

something

his

enter
giles
carries
some
large

what's
that

and

plans
for

they
were

power
mainframe
the

is
being
kept
under

in

on

buffy
points
to
a

sheet
there
unfortunately
that's
all
i
could
get
out
of
my
informant
before
his
aggressive
tendencies
forced
me
to
introduce
him
to
mr
pointy
well
now
here's
what
i
think
we
should
do
i
figure
we
can
enter
through
the
skylight
i'll
take
angel
with
me
agreed
and
there's
a
fire
ladder
on
the
east
side
of
the
building
xander
points
here
yes
yes
fine
but
we
still
need
to
consider
whether
the
mayor
it
won't
be
enough
to
simply
have
possession
of
the
box
right
we
have
to
destroy
it
not
just
physically
ritually
with
some
down
and
dirty
black
magic
hang
on
we
don't
know
what
such
a
ritual
would
require
giles
flipping
through
a
book
i
think
the
breath
of
the
atropyx
is
standard
for
this
sort
of
thing
fairly
simple
recipe
xander
wesley
attempts
to
read
over
giles's
shoulder
but
giles
hands
the
book
to
xander
i
know
i'm
ingredient
getting
guy
alright
stop
i
demand
everyone
stop
this
instant
wesley
everyone
looks
at
him
i'm
in
charge
here
and
i
say
this
is
all
moving
much
too
fast
we
need
time
to
fully
analyze
the
situation
and
devise
a
proper
and
strategic
strategem
wes
hop
on
the
train
or
get
off
the
tracks
the
mayor
will
most
assuredly
have
supernatural
safeguards
protecting
the
box
wesley

oh
we
all
forgot
about
that
did

ooh
if

the
two
vampire
guards

clandestine

i
just
i
i
feel
like
we
should
all
be
wearing
trench
coats
let
her
go
no
not
until
the
box
is
in
my
hands
so
you're
the
little
girl
that's
been
causing
me
all
this
trouble
she's
pretty
angel
a
little
skinny
still
don't
understand
why
it
couldn't
work
out
with
you
and
my
faith
guess
you
kind
of
just
have
strange
taste
in
women
well
what
can
i
say
i
like
them
sane
willow
makes
a
sound
as
faith
tightens
her
grip
angel
well
i
wish
you
kids
the
best
i
really
do
but
if
you
don't
mind
a
bit
of
fatherly
advice
i
uh
ii
just
don't
see
much
of
a
future
for
you
two
i
don't
sense
a
lasting
relationship
and
not
just
because
i
plan
to
kill
you
you
two
have
a
bumpy
road
ahead
i
don't
think
we
need
to
talk
about
this
god
you
kids
you
know
you
don't
like
to
think
about
the
future
you
don't
like
to
make
plans
unless
you
want
faith
to
gut
your
friend
like
a
sea
bass
show
a
little
respect
for
your
elders
you're
not
my
elder
i've
got
a
lotta
years
on
you
yeah
and
that's
just
one
of
the
things
you're
going
to
have
to
deal
with
you're
immortal
she's
not
it's
not
i
married
my
edna
may
in
oughtthree
and
i
was
with
her
right
until
the
end
not
a
pretty
picture
wrinkled
and
senile
and
cursing
me
for
my
youth
wasn't
our
happiest
time
and
let's
not
forget
the
fact
that
any
moment
of
true
happiness
will
turn
you
evil
i
mean
come
on
what
kind
of
a
life
can
you
offer
her
i
don't
see
a
lot
of
sunday
picnics
in
the
offing
i
see
skulking
in
the
shadows
hiding
from
the
sun
she's
a
blossoming
young
girl
and
you
want
to
keep
her
from
the
life
she
should
have
until
it
has
passed
her
by
my
god
i
think
that's
a
little
selfish
is
that
what
you
came
back
from
hell
for
is
that
your
greater
purpose

collapses
to

floor
and
stops
moving
the
spider
releases
him

sits
up
with
wounds
on
his
face

stares
in
horror
at
the
mayor's
face

books
of
ascension
volumes
one
through
five
is
there
anything
you
can
remember
that
could
be
of
use
to
us
anything
at
all
well
i
was
in
a
hurry
and
what
i
did
read
was
kind
of
overinvolved
if
you
ask
me
way
overwritten
actually
there
were
a
few
pages
that
looked
kind
of
interesting
but
i
didn't
have
a
chance
to
read
them
fully
giles
looks
disheartened
willow
pulls
some
folded
pages
out
of
a
pocket
see
what
you
can
make
of
them
giles
smiles
like
a
kid
at
christmas
and
rushes
off
this
is
your
night
for
suave
will
you
should
get
captured
more
often
no
thank
you
well
let's
hope
there
is
something
useful
in
those
pages
the
mayor
has
the
box
of
gavrock
as
of
now
we
are
right
back
where
we
started

they
tumble
onto
the
ground
i

you
although
i'm
fond

get
me
wrong
of
you
the
other
night
you
know
being
captured
and
all
facing
off
with
faith
things
just
kind
of
got
clear
i
mean
you've
been
fighting
evil
here
for
three
years
and
i've
helped
some
and
now
we're
supposed
to
decide
what
we
want
to
do
with
our
lives
and
i
just
realized
that
that's
what
i
want
to
do
fight
evil
help
people
i
mean
ii
think
it's
worth
doing
and
i
don't
think
you
do
it
because
you
have
to
it's
a
good
fight
buffy
and
i
want
in
i
kind
of
love
you
and
besides
i
have
a
shot
at
being
a
badass
wiccan
and
what
better
place
to
learn
i
feel
the
need
for
more
sugar
than
the
human
body
can
handle
mochas
yes
please
it's
weird
you
look
at
something
and
you
think
you
know
exactly
what
you're
seeing
and
then
you
find
out
it's
something
else
entirely
neat
huh
sometimes
it
is
scene
change

in
the
dress
shop
where
xander
and
cordelia
last
fought
cordelia
is
holding
a
dress
in
front
of
her
looking
in
a
fulllength
mirror
a
woman
in
a
suit
enters
the
room
behind
her
chase
what
are
you
doing
your
break's

scene
change

night
in
a
graveyard
buffy
and
angel
are
holding
hands
sitting
on
a
blanket
leaning
against
a
gravestone
it's
gonna
be
fun

and
i
are
going
to
go
on
saturday
to
check
out
the
campus
i'm
hoping
mom
will
let
me
live
there
it's
too
far
to
come
home
every
night
plus
the
whole
lack
of
cool
factor
either
way
i'll
be
close
to
your
place
i
don't
know
what
the
mayor
was
talking
about
how
could
he
know
anything
about
us
well
he's
evil
big
time
he
doesn't
even
know
what
a
lasting
relationship
is
no
probably
the
only
lasting
relationship
he's
ever
had
is
with
evil
yeah
big
stupid
evil
guy

be
okay
we
will
