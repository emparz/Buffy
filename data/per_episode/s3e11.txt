a
sunnydale
park
at
night
buffy
slowly
strolls
along
the
perimeter
and
into
an
area
surrounded
by
bushes
she
hears
a
rustling
sound
coming
from
the
bush
directly
in
front
of
her
and
stops
instantly
her
gaze
fixed
on
the
shaking
branches
she
pulls
out
her
stake
and
gets
ready
to
fight
when
suddenly
she
hears
a
voice
to
her
left
is
it
a
vampire
buffy
snaps
her
head
to
the
left
and
sees
her
mother
walk
toward
her
carrying
a
bag
in

hand
and
a
large
thermos
in

pretty
dull
you

buffy
distracted
bam

stick
poof
her
attention
is
back
on
the
rustling
bush
and
she
nudges
her
mother
to
the
side
a
bit
suddenly
a
vampire
jumps
out
at
her
and
runs
straight
for
her
she
ducks
as
the
vampire
lunges
at
her
with
his
arms
outstretched
she
gets
back
up
and
delivers
a
right
hook
to
his
face
followed
by
a
backhand
punch
on
the
backswing
and
a
left
to
the
face
making
him
take
a
step
back
her
mother
cheers
her
on
good
honey
kill
him
buffy
does
an
outtoin
crescent
kick
which
he
easily
ducks
she
tries
to
punch
him
in
the
face
again
but
he
grabs
onto
her
shoulders
and
rolls
onto
his
back
sending
her
rolling
over
him
and
onto
her
back
she
lets
out
a
pained
grunt
and
looks
around
to
get
her
bearings
joyce
points
buffy
hehe's
over
here
the
vampire
faces
her
and
roars
oh
my
god
it's
mr
sanderson
from
the
bank
he
comes
at
buffy
with
a
front
snap
kick
which
she
low
blocks
he
tries
to
punch
her
but
she
ducks
it
buffy
does
a
half
spinning
intoout
crescent
kick
followed
swiftly
by
a
leg
sweep
knocking
the
vampire's
legs
out
from
under
him
she
stands
back
up
and
gets
ready
to
punch
him
but
he's
had
enough
he
scrambles
to
his
feet
and
hightails
it
out
of
there
joyce
points
with
the
thermos
and
he's
getting
away
buffy
gives
her
a
stern
look
stay
she
runs
off
after
the
vampire
joyce
lets
out
a
worried
sigh
and
decides
to
walk
the
short
distance
over
to
the
playground
there
she
sets
down
her
bag
and
the
thermos
on
a
bench
near
the
swings
she
shivers
a
bit
from
the
cold
night
air
she
steps
over
to
the
concrete
border
between
the
grass
and
the
sand
of
the
playground
and
notices
a
toy
pickup
truck
that
was
left
behind
in
a
small
puddle
she
picks
it
up
and
smiles
as
she
looks
it
over
then
something
catches
her
eye
at
the
other
side
of
the
playground
cut
to
buffy
on
the
ground
with
the
vampire
bending
over
her
she
grabs
him
and
pulls
him
over
and
down
onto
the
ground
next
to
her
she
scrambles
to
her
knees
and
jams
her
stake
home
the
vampire
explodes
in
a
cloud
of
ashes
cut
to
joyce
as
she
makes
her
way
over
to
the
carousel
when
she's
close
enough
to
get
a
good
look
she
stops
in
horror
shocked
at
what
she
sees
oh
god
joyce
takes
a
breath
oh
cut
to
a
long
shot
of
her
with
the
carousel
in
the
foreground
the
body
of
a
young
boy
lies
dead
on
it
and
next
to
it
on
the
sand
lies
the
body
of
a
young
girl
joyce
can't
believe
her
eyes
each
of
the
children
has
one
arm
outstretched
and
drawn
in
black
on
the
palms
of
their
hands
is
a
triangle
it
has
a
wide
ushaped
symbol
in
the
middle
with
its
ends
extending
out
from
the
triangle
and
bending
in
a
sharp
arc
at
the
tips
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part

the
playground
several
police
cars
and
a
coroner's
van
have
arrived
and
the
detectives
are
looking
over
the
scene
no
one
has
touched
the
bodies
yet
the
police
photographer
steps
up
to
the
carousel
and
takes
aim
at
the
young
boy
with
his
camera
a
series
of
blackandwhite
photos
follow
the
boy's
outstretched
arm
with
the

an
interview
with
a
police
officer

asks
him
if

and
her

tiny
buffy
sympathetically
i
saw
joyce
shaking
her
head
who
could
do
something
like

i
just
joyce

buffy
hugs
her
mother
closely
joyce
begins
to
sob
buffy
comfortingly
i

i'll
take
care
of
everything
i
promise

and
calm
down
cut
to
the
library
the
next
morning
buffy
looks
up
at
giles
standing
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
to
the
book
stacks
buffy
upset
don't
tell
me
to
calm
down
giles
taken
aback
iii
only
meant
they
were
kids
giles
little
kids
you
don't
know
what
it
was
like
to
see
them
there
my
mom
can't
even
talk
giles
takes
a
few
steps
down
i'm
sorry
i
i
just
want
to
help
buffy
calms
a
bit
i
know
giles
comes
down
the
rest
of
the
way
and
goes
over
to
the
center
table
buffy
follows
and
leans
against
the
back
of
a
chair
do
we
know
how
uh
it
wasn't
a
vampire
giles
sits
on
the
table
no
there
were
no
marks
giles
lifts
his
mug
for
a
sip
of
his
tea
but
stops
as
buffy
continues
wait
ii
mean
there
there
was
a
mark
um
aa
symbol
she
steps
around
the
chair
grabs
a
pen
from
the
table
and
sits
to
draw
it
giles
hurriedly
sets
down
his
mug
and
quickly
reaches
over
to
stop
buffy
before
she
can
deface
the
parchments
lying
there
in
front
of
her
oh
uh
12th
century
papal
encyclical
write
on
this
he
gently
picks
up
the
parchments
and
nudges
a
spiral
notebook
over
to
her
buffy
flips
the
notebook
to
a
blank
page
and
draws
as
giles
sets
down
the
parchments
and
picks
up
his
mug
again
iit
was
on
their
hands
the
cops
are
keeping
it
quiet
but
i
got
a
good
look
at
it
she
pushes
the
drawing
over
for
giles
to
see
there
find
me
the
thing
that
uses
this
symbol
and
point
me
at
it
giles
thoughtfully
hmm
hmm
what
giles
speak
giles
torn
from
his
reverie
what
oh
sorry
um
no
it
giles
picks
up
the
notebook
i
just
wonder
if
we're
looking
for
a
thing
the
use
of
a
symbol
ooon
a
victim
like
this
suggests
a
a
ritual
murder
and
a
cult
sacrifice
by
a
group
a
group
of
human
beings
someone
with
a
soul
did
this
yes
i'm
afraid
so
he
goes
over
to
the
bookshelves
behind
the
table
and
starts
his
research
okay
then
while
you're
looking
for
the
meaning
of
that
symbol
thingy
could
you
also
find
a
loophole
in
that
'slayers
don't
kill
people'
rule
giles
looks
back
at
her
from
his
crouched
position
buffy
this
is
a
dreadful
crime
i
know
giles
stands
up
and
you
have
every
right
to
be
upset
but
ii
wonder
if
you're
not
letting
yourself
get
a
shade
uh
more
personal
because
of
your
mother's
involvement
buffy
stands
and
faces
him
oh
it's
completely
personal
giles
find
me

people

of
such
a

crime

what
a
caring
community
sunnydale
is
now
sure
we've
had
our
share
of
misfortunes
but
we're
a
good
town
with
good
people
and
i
know
that
none
of
us
will
rest
easy
until
this
horrible
murder
is
solved
with
that
in
mind
mayor

picks
up
one
of
the
signs
i
make
these
words
my
pledge
to
you
mayor
wilkins
holds
it
up
for
everyone
to

your
attention
to
the
woman
who

here
tonight
joyce

away
as
joyce
walks
to
the
front
of
the
room
and
steps
up
to
the
lectern
thank
you
she
considers
her
words
for
a
moment
before
beginning
mr
mayor
you're
dead
wrong
joyce
people
begin
to
murmur
this
is
not
a
good
town
how
many
of
us
have
have
lost
someone
who
who
just
disappeared
or
or
got
skinned
or
suffered
neck
rupture
and
how
many
of
us
have
been
too
afraid
to
speak
out
ii
was
supposed
to
lead
us
in
a
moment
of
silence
but
silence
is
this
town's
disease
for
too
long
wewe've
been
plagued
by
unnatural
evils
this
isn't
our
town
anymore
it
belongs
to
the
monsters
and
and
the
witches
and
the
slayers
buffy
looks
at
her
mother
in
openmouthed
shock
she
and
willow
exchange
a
worried
glance
giles
can't
believe
what
he's
hearing
either
i
say
it's
time
for
the
grownups
to
take
sunnydale
back
i
say
we
start
by
finding
the
people
who
did
this
and
making
them
pay
the
people
in
the
crowd
begin
to
applaud
hear
hear
sheila
claps
her
hands
and
looks
around
at
the
other
people
a
man
nods
his
head
in
silent
agreement
buffy
is
too
much
in
shock
to
do
anything
but
stare
at
her
mother
cut
to
a
panning
shot
of
a
sunnydale
residential
area
at
night
the
streets
are
quiet
cut
to
willow's
house
the
light
from
her
room
is
clearly
visible
from
the
street
cut
inside
the
camera
is
centered
on
a
skull
with
a
hole
at
the
crest
of
the
cranium
it
is
resting
on
a
throw
rug
next
to
a
burning
candle
a
hand
reaches
over
the
hole
in
the
skull
and
drops
in
a
short
string
of
beads
the
camera
pans
up
to
michael
a
witch
draped
in
a
black
hooded
cloak
he
folds
his
hands
intertwining
his
fingers
and
glances
up
at
another
cloaked
figure
as
it
steps
around
him
the
figure
kneels
to
pick
up
the
skull
and
it's
amy
she
stands
back
up
and
carries
the
skull
around
the
rug
to
a
position
opposite
michael
the
camera
follows
her
panning
low
across
the
rug
where
there
are
other
candles
cups
of
powders
and
potions
and
a
small
cauldron
amy
sets
down
the
skull
and
sits
she
takes
a
cup
of
powder
and
hands
it
to
a
third
figure
who
takes
it
from
her
and
pours
the
contents
into
the
steaming
liquid
in
the
cauldron
the
camera
pans
up
to
reveal
the
third
figure
as
willow
also
cloaked
in
black
she
stares
silently
down
at
the
boiling
mixture
cut
to
a
shot
from
above
the
camera
pulls
up
from
the
cauldron
taking
in
the
array
of
things
and
the
three
witches
around
it
and
continues
until
it's
high
enough
to
see
the
pattern
in
the
center
of
the
throw
rug
a
large
triangle
with
a
ushaped
symbol
in
the
middle
its
ends
extending
out
of
the
triangle
and
bending
in
a
sharp
arc
at
the
tips

a
group
of

up

and
shakes
his
head

comes
to
michael's
defense

by

and
slams

lockers
everyone

he's
into
that
voodoo

in
my
face
and
you'll
find
out
buffy
steps
up
behind
amy
and
gives
him
a
smile
he
notices
her
and
suddenly
thinks
better
of
going
any
further
he
lets
michael
go
and
straightens
his
shirt
a
bit
no
problem
here
roy
nods
to
the
other
boys
we're
walking
buffy
follows
them
for
a
few
steps
then
turns
back
to
michael
and
amy

michael
walks
off
amy
smiles

buffy
amy
walks
off
buffy
looks
back
down
the
hall
to
make
sure
the
gang
is
still
headed
away
giles
comes
around
the
corner
and
buffy
starts
toward
him
but
is
headed
off
by
cordelia
you'll
be
one
busy
little
slayer
babysitting
them
i
doubt
they'll
have
any
more
trouble
i
doubt
your
doubt
everyone
knows
that
witches
killed
those
kids
and
amy
is
a
witch
and
michael
is
whatever
the
boy
of
witch
is
plus
being
the
poster
child
for
yuck
corde
cordelia
interrupts
if
you're
gonna
hang
with
them
expect
badness
'cause
that's
what
you
get
when
you
hang
with
freaks
and
losers
believe
me
i
know
she
starts
down
the
hall
but
stops
and
turns
back
to
buffy
cordelia
smiling
that
was
a
pointed
comment
about
me
hanging
with
you
guys
cordelia
turns
and
leaves
yeah
i
got
that
one
buffy
loudly
after
her
besides
witches
didn't
do
it
buffy
turns
to
giles
giles
whispers
actually
i
think
they
may
have
my
research
keeps
bringing
me
back
to
european
wiccan
covens
you
found
the
meaning
of
the
symbol
giles
exhales
i'm
pretty
sure
yes
there's
a
a
piece
of
information
i
need
that's
in
a
book
that
willow
borrowed
can
you
find
it
he
goes
down
the
hall
toward
the
library
buffy
looks
around
into
the
student
lounge
to
see
if
willow
happens
to
be
there
she
sees
xander
sitting
on
one
of
the
couches
and
heads
over
to
him
buffy
hi
hey
is
willow
around
xander
exasperated
how
can
i
convince
you
people
that
it's
over
you
assume
because
i'm
here
she's
here
that
i
somehow
mysteriously
know
where
she
is
buffy
points
those
her
books
yeah
she's
in
the
bathroom
xander
points
buffy
takes
a
step
toward
willow's
books
but
stops
as
xander
continues
but
the
fact
that
i
know
that
doesn't
change
that
i
have
a
genuine
complaint
here
look
i'm
getting
sick
of
the
judgment
the
innuendos
is
a
man
not
innocent
until
proven
guilty
you
are
guilty
you
got
illicit
smoochies
gonna
have
to
pay
the
price
she
tries
again
to
go
to
willow's
books
but
xander
isn't
finished
yet
but
i'm
talking
about
the
future
guilt
look
everyone
expects
me
to
mess
up
again
like
oz
i
see
how
he
is
around
me
you
know
that
steely
gaze
that
pointed
silence
'cause
he's
usually
such
a
chatterbox
this
time
she
just
goes
to
willow's
books
and
lets
xander
talk
no
but
it's
different
now
it's
more
a
verbal
nonverbal
he
speaks
volumes
with
his
eyes
buffy
finds
the
book
in
question
and
picks
it
up
underneath
it
is
a
spiral
notebook
on
the
exposed
page

the
triangle
symbol
buffy
picks
it
up
and
stares

protection

snyder

group
with
the
bags
in
hand
ms
rosenberg
my
office
he
holds
up
the
bags
of
henbane
and
mandrake
root
willow
stares
back
at
him
eyes
wide
with
worry
and
fear
buffy
discreetly
walks
in
front
of
her
and
takes
giles'
book
from
her
arms
willow
starts
down
the
halls
in
front
of
snyder
oz
accompanies
her
with
his
hand
on
her
back
in
a
gesture
of
comfort
cut
to
the
library
a
police
officer
kicks
open
the
cage
door
and
strides
out
into
the
room
with
a
stack
of
books
in
his
hands
he
carries
them
over
to
the
table
and
drops
them
unceremoniously
into
a
box
another
officer
comes
down
from
the
stacks
with
another
armful
of
books
buffy
comes
into
the
library
as
still
another
officer
walks
out
carrying
one
of
the
boxes
she
heads
straight
for
giles
who
watches
helplessly
giles
they're
confiscating
my
books
giles
we
need
those
books
believe
me
i
tried
to
tell
that
to
the
nice
man
with
the
big
gun
they
move
to
the
side
to
talk
giles
watches
the
activity
around
him
seething
with
anger
no
there's
something
about
the
symbol
that
we're
missing
willow
said
she
used
it
in
a
protection
spell
it's
harmless
not
a
big
bad
so
then
why
would
it
turn
up
in
a
ritual
sacrifice
i
don't
know
ordinarily
i
would
say
let's
widen
our
research
using
what
aa
dictionary
and
'my
friend
flicka'
she
sets
the
book
on
the
counter
as
giles
steps
back
into
the
room
this
is
intolerable
snyder's
interfered
before
but
i
i
won't
take
this
from
that
twisted
little
homunculus
snyder
walks
into
the
library
holding
a
cup
of
coffee
snyder
smirking
i
love
the
smell
of
desperate
librarian
in
the
morning
giles
approaches
him
angrily
you
get
out
and
take
your
marauders
with
you
snyder
unaffected
oh
my
so
fierce
snyder
walks
past
him
i
suppose
i
should
hear
you
out
just
how
is
um
snyder
takes
a
book
from
an
officer
reads
the
title
'blood
rites
and
sacrifices'
appropriate
material
for
a
public
school
library
chess
club
branching
out
snyder
sips
his
coffee
this
is
not
over
oh
i
should
say
it's
just
beginning
fight
it
if
you
want
just
remember
lift
a
finger
against
me
and
you'll
have
to
answer
to
moo
buffy
incredulous
answer
to
moo
did
that
sentence
just
make
some
sense
that
i'm
not
in
on
'mothers
opposed
to
the
occult'
a
powerful
new
group
snyder
sips
his
coffee
and
who
came
up
with
that
lame
name
snyder
heads
out
that
would
be
the
founder
i
believe
you
call
her
'mom'
buffy
can't
believe
it
cut
to
willow's
house
that
night
she
opens
the
door
and
goes
in
in
the
living
room
she
finds
her
mother
looking
over
a
bunch
of
her
things
taken
from
her
room
her
mother
notices
her
come
in
oh
sit
down
honey
willow
goes
to
the
couch
principal
snyder
talk
to
you
willow
takes
off
her
pack
and
sits
yes

quite
concerned
sheila
looks
at
an
old
picture
mom

know
what
this
looks
like
and
i
can
totally
sheila
interrupts
oh
you
don't
have
to
explain
honey
this
isn't
exactly
a
surprise
sheila
turns
over
the
picture
willow
fidgets
confused
why
not
sheila
shrugs
oh
well
identification
with
mythical
icons
is
perfectly
typical
of
your
age
group
it's
a
a
classic
adolescent
response
to
the
pressures
of
incipient
adulthood
sheila
set
the
picture
down
oh
is
that
what
it
is
sheila
picks
up
a
bag
of
herbs
of
course
i
wish
you
could've
identified
with
something
a
little
less
icky
sheila
shrugs
but
developmentally
speaking
mom
i'm
not
an
age
group
i'm
me
willow
group
oh
honey
she
puts
down
the
bag
and
gets
up
to
go
over
to
her
daughter
i
understand
sheila
sits
next
to
her
no
you
don't
willow
faces
her
mom
this
may
be
hard
for
you
to
accept
but
i
can
do
stuff
nothing
bad
or
dangerous
but
i
can
do
spells
you
think
you
can
and
that's
what
concerns
me
the
delusions
mom
how
would
you
know
what
i
can
do
i
mean
the
last
time
we
had
a
conversation
over
three
minutes
it
was
about
the
patriarchal
bias
of
the
mr
rogers
show
well
sheila
makes
finger
quotes
with
king
friday
lording
it
over
all
the
lesser
puppets
mom
you're
not
paying
attention
and
this
is
your
way
of
trying
to
get
it
now
i
have
consulted
with
some
of
my
colleagues
and
they
agree
that
this
is
a
cry
for
discipline
you're
grounded
willow
surprised
grounded
this
is
the
first
time
ever
i've
done
something

a
rebel

a
rebellion
sheila
smiling
willow

don't
need
to
act
out
like
this
to
prove
your
specialness
mom
i'm
not
acting
out
i'm
a
witch
ii
can
make
pencils
float
and
i
can
summon
the
four
elements

her
mother
doesn't

buffy
and
maybe

that
the
world
is

antihellsucking

the
playground
where
the
children
were
found
the
carousel
is
bedecked
with
candles
and
flowers
and
pictures
of
the
children
buffy
quietly
walks
up
to
it
she
pulls
her
arms
to
her
body
for
warmth
to
her
right
she
notices
angel
approaching
hey
hi
they
embrace
each
other
lovingly
for
a
long
moment
buffy
looks
up
into
his
face
how
are
you
i'm
alright
i
think
i'm
better
than
you
right
now
they
both
look
over
at
the
carousel
i
heard
about
this
people
are
talking
people
are
even
talking
to
me
it's
strange
people
die
in
sunnydale
all
the
time
i've
never
seen
anything
like
this
they
both
stroll
over
to
a
bench
they
were
children
innocent
it
makes
a
difference
they
sit
facing
each
other
and
mr
sanderson
from
the
bank
had
it
coming
buffy
sighs
my
mom
said
some
things
to
me
about
being
the
slayer
that
it's
fruitless
shakes
her
head
no
fruit
for
buffy
she's
wrong
is
she
is
sunnydale
any
better
than
when
i
first
came
here
okay
so
i
battle
evil
but
i
don't
really
win
the
bad
keeps
coming
back
and
getting
stronger
like
that
kid
in
the
story
buffy
gestures
the
boy
that
stuck
his
finger
in
the
duck
dike
buffy
gives
him
a
confused
look
angel
smiles
it's
another
word
for
dam
oh
okay
that
story
makes
a
lot
more
sense
now
buffy
you
know
i'm
still
figuring
things
out
there's
a
lot
i
don't
understand
but
i
do
know
it's
important
to
keep
fighting
i
learned
that
from
you
but
we
never
we
never
win
not
completely
we
never
will
that's
not
why
we
fight
we
do
it
'cause
there's
things
worth
fighting
for
those
kids
their
parents
buffy
has
an
epiphany
their

point
i
will
become

heart
we

looks
at

hopefully
as
the
two
boys
go
to
stand
behind
him
you
can
put
the
heart
back
we
can't
get
them
they're
locked
up
in

xander
teases
'frisky

comes
striding
into

his

up
the
next
page
'1899

giles
oz
confused
a
hundred

how
is
this
possible
there's
no
mention
of

they've
never
been

this
one

dated
1649
and
has
a
hand
drawing
of
the
two
children
an
instant
message
window
pops
up
with
a
note
from
willow
ah
there
were
more
articles
every
fifty
years
all
the
same
giles
intrigued
from
as
far
back
as
1649
can
i
see
that
oz
surrenders
his
place
to
giles
he
types
a
bit
then
reads
the
german
and
translates
written
by
a
cleric
from
a
village
near
the
black
forest
he
found
the
bodies
himself
two
children
greta
strauss
age

i
thought
i
made
myself
clear
you're
not
minding
me
she
folds
down
the
screen
and
pulls
out
the
phone
line
mom
i
see
what
you're
doing
you're
challenging
me
but
i
will
not
have
you
communicating
with
your
cybercoven
or
what
have
you
willow
sits
up
coven
what
happened
to
me
being
delusional
and
acting
out
well
that
was
before
i
talked
in
depth
with
ms
summers
and
her
associates
it
seems
i've
been
rather
closeminded
so
you
believe
me
sheila
sighs
i
believe
you
dear
now
all
i
can
do
is
let
you
go
with
love
willow
doesn't
like
the
sound
of
that
let
me
go
what
does
that
mean
her
mother
turns
and
walks
out
of
the
room
without
saying
a
word
pulling
the
door
closed
behind
her
and
locking
it
from
the
outside
mom
cut
to
the
library
giles
paces
while
oz
keeps
looking
for
more
information
on
the
web
uh
wait
wait
a
minute
uh
uh
there
is
a
fringe
theory
held
by
a
few
folklorists
that
some
regional
stories
have
actual
um
very
literal
antecedents
and
in
some
language
that's
english
fairy
tales
are
real
hans
and
gre
buffy
her
mind
clicks
hansel
and
gretel
wait
hansel
and
gretel
breadcrumbs
ovens
gingerbread
house
of
course
well
it
makes
sense
now
yeah
it's
all
falling
into
place
of
course
that
place
is
nowhere
near
this
place
giles
sits
on
the
table
some
demons
thrive
by
fostering
hatred
and
and
uh
persecution
amongst
the
mortal
animals
not
by
not
by
destroying
men
but
by
watching
men
destroy
each
other
now
they
feed
us
our
darkest
fear
and
turn
peaceful
communities
into
vigilantes
hansel
and
gretel
run
home
to
tell
everyone
about
the
mean
old
witch
and
then
she
and
probably
dozens
of
others
are
persecuted
by
a
righteous
mob
it's
happened
all
throughout
history
it
happened
in
salem
not
surprisingly
whoa

before

unclean

she
is
engulfed
by
a
sudden
burst
of
flame
people
in

instant
later

drop
to
the
books
below
everyone
stares
in
amazement
buffy
and
willow
look
over
to
see
what
happened
to
her
then
a
rat
comes
crawling
out
of
amy's
clothes
it
scampers
down
the
pile
of
books
and
scurries
across
the
floor
the
frightened
adults
jump
out
of
its
way

can
only
watch
amy
go
she
couldn't
do

about
uh
lifting
a
veil
um
it
should
uh
make
the
demons
appear
in
their
true
form
which
with
any
luck
will
uh
negate
their
influence
and
uh
drop
a
toadstone
into
the
mixture
cordelia
picks
it
up
this
cordelia
sniffs
it
it
doesn't

the
noises
coming
from

rushes
over
to
the
doors
but
finds

desperation
and
unexpectedly
reaches
into
cordelia's
hair
and
pulls
out
a
hairpin
ouch

with
that
giles
ignores
her
protests
and
kneels
down
in
from
of
the
doors

carefully
inserts
the
pin
into
the
lock
and
begins
to
pick
it
god
you

little
youthful
offender

and
cringe

getting
very
close
to
willow
buffy
i
can't
take
it

and
comes
in
it
wouldn't
be
buffy
sees
giles
giles
points
cordelia
to
a
fire
hose
in
the
corner
she
goes
to
it
and
smashes
the
glass
with
her
elbow
holding
up
her
hand
to
protect
her
face
from
the
glass
the
noise
gets
the
crowd's
attention
stop
them
cordelia
pulls
out
the
hose
and
turns
it
on
spraying
the
advancing
crowd
giles
starts
reciting
his
incantation
in
very
bad
unintelligible
german
muffled
by
the
sound
of
the
water
spraying
cordelia
to
the
people
you
like
that
huh
how
'bout
some
more
in
spite
of
all
the
spraying
not
very
much
water
has
gotten
on
the
flames
and
they
have
gotten
dangerously
close
to
willow
buffy
i'm
on
fire
cordelia
put
out
the
fire
oh
right
she
turns
the
stream
of
water
on
the
flames
and
quickly
douses
them
cut
to
the
ventilation
shafts
oz
and
xander
are
still
trying
to
find
their
way
to
the
room
cut
to
the
room
cordelia
gets
the
last
of
the
flames
extinguished
and
turns
off
the
water
hansel
and
gretel
slowly
walk
up
to
them
buffy
and
willow
pant
in
relief
the
children
keep
closing
in
on
giles
giles
raises
the
bottle
with
his
potion
high
and
recites
an
incantation
ihr
goetter
ruft
euch
an
verbergt
euch
nicht
hinter
falschen
gesichtern
you
gods
i
call
upon
you
do
not
hide
behind
false
faces
he
throws
the
bottle
to
the
floor
smashing
it
in
front
of
the
children
the
potion
begins
to
steam
around
them
hansel
and
gretel
look
at
each
other
and
embrace
a
moment
later
the
two
children
morph
into
a
single
demon
standing
over
seven
feet
215cm
tall
its
ears
are
pointed
and
huge
fangs
jut
from
its
lower
jaw
its
skin
is
red
and
mottled
and
its
hair
is
long
and
tangled
okay
i
think
i
liked
the
two
little
ones
more
than
the
one
big
one
sheila
and
joyce
stare
up
at
the
demon
in
horror
the
other
people
in
the
room
all
run
out
screaming
the
demon
turns
to
face
buffy
out
of
her
trance
now
joyce
looks
at
the
two
girls
tied
up
and
helpless
against
him
oh
my
god
protect
us
kill
the
bad
girls
you
know
what
not
as
convincing
in
that
outfit
the
demon
roars
and
comes
at
her
buffy
struggles
with
her
bonds
trying
to
get
free
the
ropes
don't
give
but
the
stake
breaks
it's
top
heavy
now
and
forces
buffy
to
bend
over
so
the
tip
is
pointing
at
the
demon
who
can't
stop
his
advance
and
impales
himself
through
the
neck
sheila
and
joyce
look
on
in
disgust
buffy
can't
straighten
herself
back
up
with
the
weight
of
the
demon's
body
at
the
other
end
of
the
stake
and
so
can't
see
the
result
of
her
unwitting
maneuver
did
i
get
it
did
i
get
it
suddenly
the
ceiling
gives
way
above
them
and
oz
and
xander
come
crashing
down
the
books
break
their
fall
they
look
up
weakly
at
buffy
and
the
dead
demon
we're
here
to
save
you
cut
to
willow's
house
on
another
night
cut
into
her
room
she
and
buffy
have
a
number
of
bowls
and
jars
of
powders
and
potions
laid
out
several
candles
are
burning
willow
idly
crushes
some
herbs
in
a
bowl
your
mom
doesn't
mind
us
doing
this
in
the
house
she
doesn't
know
business
as
usual
hmm
sort
of
she's
doing
that
selective
memory
thing
your
mom
used
to
be
so
good
at
she
forgot
everything
willow
ruefully
no
she
remembered
the
part
where
i
said
i
was
dating
a
musician
she
takes
a
pinch
of
the
herbs
she's
crushed
and
sprinkles
it
onto
a
ceremonial
iron
plate
set
out
between
the
girls
oz
has
to
come
for
dinner
next
week
so
that's
sort
of
like
taking
an
interest
buffy
looks
down
at
their
preparations
and
sighs
okay
should
we
try
this
again
let's
do
it
i
think
we
got
the
mix
of
herbs
right
this
time
okay
ready
she
lights
a
match
and
sets
it
to
the
mixture
of
herbs
and
roots
on
the
plate
while
willow
recites
her
spell
it
begins
to
burn
emitting
purple
smoke
diana
hecate
i
hereby
license
thee
to
depart
goddess
of
creatures
great
and
small
i
conjure
thee
to
withdraw
willow
and
buffy
both
look
over
at
amy
the
rat
she
gets
up
on
her
hind
legs
expectantly
nothing
happens
though
and
she
gets
back
down
on
all
fours
seemingly
disappointed
buffy
looks
over
at
willow
maybe
we
should
get
her
one
of
those
wheel
thingies
