oz's
room
all
his
stuff
still
remains
willow
is
walking
around
then
sits
on
his
bed
bringing
one
of
his
shirts
to
her
face
and
smelling
it
cut
to
uc
sunnydale
student
lounge
buffy
is
walking
through
and
sees
riley
who
is
hanging
a
banner
that
reads
uc
sunnydale
lesbian
alliance
hey
thanks
riley
riley
climbs
down
off
the
ladder
taking
a
look
buffy
walks
up
behind
him
looks
good
riley
notices
buffy
oh
hey
buffy
buffy
jokingly
is
there
something
you
want
to
tell
me
what
buffy
looks
towards
the
banner
riley
does
the
same
catching
on
oh
yes
—
i
am
a
lesbian
well
it's
good
that
you're
so
open
about
it
he
smiles
and
they
head
off
through
the
lounge
oh
hey
you
know
how
we
were
talking
about
having
a
picnic
i
was
thinkin'
—
do
you
ever
hang
out
at
rhode's
field
it's
beautiful
there
usually
not
that
crowded
either
i
thought
maybe
we
could
have
a
little
spread
—
sandwiches
maybe
some
ants
it'll
be
fun
we
were
talking
about
having
a
picnic
so
was
that
a
conversation
i
actually
had
or
one
i
was
just
practicing
practicing
okay
yes
—
i
have
been
known
to
do
a
little
prep
work
before
our
conversations
it's
not
easy
you
know
talking
to
you
sometimes
it's
like
an
oral
exam
boy
that's
just
what
every
girl
longs
to
hear
well
you're
tricky
like
an
exam
i
never
know
how
you're
going
to
react
to
something
that's
why
i
like
you
so
much
you're
a
mystery
probably
every
beautiful
girl
in
the
world
has
some
jerk
telling
her
she's
a
mystery
but
i
swear
you
really
are
there's
a
lot
about
you
that
needs
puzzling
out
buffy's
just
staring
at
him
with
this
wistful
look
in
her
eyes
i
loose
you
somewhere
right
around
beautiful
he
smiles
shyly
hey
—
don't
you
just
love
a
picnic
cut
to
the
graveyard
willow
and
buffy
are
patrolling
it's
just
different
you
know
a
picnic
first
of
all
daylight
—
kind
of
a
new
venue
buffywise
and
the
best
part
—
he
said
he
would
bring
all
the
food
so
all
i
have
to
do
was
to
show
up
and
eat
those
are
two
things
i'm
really
good
at
so
he's
nice
very
very
and
there's
sparkage
yeah
he's—
have
you
seen
his
arms
those
are
good
arms
to
have
i
really
like
him
i
do
but
i
don't
know
i
really
like
being
around
him
you
know
and
i
think
he
cares
about
me
but
i
just
feel
like
something's
missing
he's
not
making
you
miserable
exactly
riley
seems
so
solid
like
he
wouldn't
cause
me
heartache
willow
fake
worry
get
out
get
out
while
there's
still
time
i
know
i
have
to
get
away
from
that
bad
boy
thing
there's
no
good
there
seeing
angel
in
la
even
for
five
minutes
hello
to
the
pain
the
pain
is
not
a
friend
but
i
can't
help
thinking
—
isn't
that
where
the
fire
comes
from
can
a
nice
safe
relationship
be
that
intense
i
know
it's
nuts
but
part
of
me
believes
that
real
love
and
passion
have
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
pain
and
fighting
suddenly
a
vampire
jumps
out
from
behind
a
bush
buffy
stakes
him
without
so
much
as
looking
the
other
way
he
crumbles
to
dust
and
she
and
willow
continue
on
their
way
i
wonder
where
i
get
that
from
opening
credits

cut
to
giles'
bathroom
buffy
is
sitting
on
the
end
of
the
bathtub
in
which
spike
is
chained
up
buffy
exasperated
soyou
saw
their
faces
but
you
can't
describe
them
spike
playing
coy
well
they
were
human
two
eyes
each
kind
of
in
the
middle
uh
huh
and
the
lab
underground
i
came
out
through
an
air
vent
i
don't
know
exactly
where
i'm
done
put
the
telly
on
giles
enters
carrying
a
mug
that
reads
kiss
the
librarian
with
a
straw
protruding
from
it
it
contains
blood
it's
about
time
hope
you
got
it
warm
enough
giles
hands
it
to
buffy
without
saying
a
word
she
takes
it
sighs
and
makes
a
face
as
she
puts
it
close
enough
to
spike
that
he
can
suck
through
the
straw
he
makes
a
big
to
do
out
of
it
so
as
to
disgust
her
more
i
don't
know
why
you're
so
dainty
all
of
a
sudden
you've
done
this
for
angel
—
you
must
have
buffy
pulls
the
mug
away
leaving
spike
with
the
straw
dangling
from
between
his
lips
hey
give
it
okay
that's
it
the
invalid
amnesiac
routine
is
over
the
kitchen
is
closed
until
you
can
tell
me
something
useful
about
the
commandos
i'm
tryin'
to
remember
it
was
very
traumatic
how
long
are
you
going
to
pull
this
crap
how
long
am
i
going
to
live
once
i
tell
you
look
look
spike
—
we
have
no
intention
of
killing
a
harmless
uh
creature
but
we
have
to
know
what's
been
done
to
you
we
can't
let
you
go
until
we're
sure
that
you're
impotent
—
hey
sorry
poor
choice
of
words
until
we're
sure
you're
you're
flaccid
you
are
one
step
away
missy
buffy
sarcastically
giles
help
he's
going
to
scold
me
spike
growls
trying
to
grab
buffy
but
the
chains
hold
him
and
only
make
his
struggles
comical
you
know
what
i
don't
think
you
want
us
to
let
you
go
maybe
we
made
it
a
little
too
comfy
in
here
for
ya
comfy
i'm
chained
in
a
bathtub
drinkin'
pig's
blood
from
a
novelty
mug
doesn't
rank
huge
in
the
zagut's
guide
you
want
something
nicer
buffy
she
leans
her
head
to
the
side
exposing
her
throat
to
him
a
look
at
my
poor
neck
all
bare
and
tender
and
exposed
all
that
blood
just
pumping
away
spike
by
this
time
is
all
but
licking
his
lips
oh
please
giles
make
her
stop
giles
walks
out
of
the
bathroom
and
into
the
living
room
speaking
to
willow
who's
reading
through
some
books
if
those
two
don't
kill
each
other
i
might
lend
a
hand
what
about
a
truth
spell
i'm
not
positive
it
would
work
on
a
vampire
but
we
could
try
make
him
fess
up
a
truth
spell
of
course
why
didn't
i
think
of
that
‘cause
you
had
your
hands
full
with
the
undead
english
patient
she
hands
giles
the
book
she
was
reading
yes
we'll
have
a
go
looks
pretty
simple
i'll
stop
by
the
magick
shop
tomorrow
excellent
alright
i'll
be
back
in
the
morning
with
donuts
and
motherwort
bye
buffy
i'll
see
you
at
home
bye
great
thank
you
willow
willow
heads
out
and
giles
heads
back
to
the
bathroom
where
buffy
is
once
again
feeding
spike
through
the
straw
um
willow
may
have
had
a
very
helpful
idea
she
seems
to
be
coping
better
with
oz's
departure
don't
you
think
she
still
has
a
way
to
go
but
yeah
—
i
think
she's
dealing
what
are
you
people
blind
she's
hangin'
on
by
a
thread
any
ninny
can
see
that
cut
to
oz's
room
it's
completely
bare
willow
enters
and
stops
looking
around
surprised
cut
to
buffy
and
willow's
dorm
room
buffy
is
sitting
on
her
bed
and
willow
is
in
her
pajamas
under
the
covers
of
her's
crying
devon
said
that
he
sent
for
his
stuff
i
guess
that
means
he's
planning
on
settling
down
somewhere
else
not
here
i
guess
so
i
feel
like
i've
been
split
down
the
center
and
half
of
me
is
lost
i
know
it
feels
like
that
now
oz
is
gone
cut
to
an
aerial
view
of
sunnydale
cut
to
giles'
bathroom
where
spike
is
reaching
desperately
for
the
tv
with
no
success

think

he
hangs
up
cut
to

sighing
exasperated
in
the
tub
cut
to
buffy
and
riley
at
their
picnic
driving
yeah
you
seriously
drive
for
fun
well
not
fourwheeling
or

you
actually
nowheeling
is
more
my
specialty
i'm
an
avid
pedestrian
you're
kidding
right
i
mean
you
know
how
to
drive
well
i
took
the
class
cars
and
buffy
are
like
unmixy
things
it's
just
because
you
haven't
had
a
good
experience
yet
you
can
have
the
best
time
in
a
car
it's
not
about
getting
somewhere
you
have
to
take
your
time
forget
about
everything
just
relax
let
it
wash
over
you
the
air
motion
just
let
it
roll
the
air
between
them
has
shifted
the
situation
has
become
more
intense
we
are
talking
about
driving
right
thought
i
was
they
share
a
moment
which
riley
snaps
out
of
i'm
taking
you
some
night
when
it's
warm
up
past
the
vineyards
—
it's
going
to
change
everything
for
you
i'm
in
willow
comes
wandering
up
all
downcast
hey
willow
willow
merely
smiles
in
response
hey
i
interrupted
you've
got
apples
my
mist
she
turns
to
go
wait
sit
there's
plenty
to
go
around
she
smiles
softly
and
joins
them
did
something
happen
is
something
wrong
no
everything's
fine
same
oh
your
apples
are
turning
brown
the
way
they
do
yeah

that
yeah
yeah
cut
to
the
bronze
swinging
as
usual
anya
xander
and
buffy
share
a
table
geez
you
mean
oz
just
sent
for
his
stuff
and
didn't
even
call
her
that's
pretty
harsh
i
only
wish
i
had
my
powers
back
i'd
liquify
his
entrails
for
her
that's
sweet
god
poor
will
no
wonder
she's—
cut
to
willow
dancing
up
a
storm
on
the
dance
floor
—having
a
wonderful
time
wow
way
to
rebound
i
believe
that's
the
dance
of
a
brave
little
toaster
willow
sees
them
and
walks
over
to
the
table
just
as
happy
as
can
be
hey

nice
to
see
you
brought
your
boogie

been
sort
of
a
partypoop
lately
so
i
said
to
myself
self
i
said
it's
time
to
shake
and
shimmy
it
off
sounds
like
a
good
policy
yeah
and
it
works
too
you
know
i
figure
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
we're
all
just—
willow
grabs
her
jacket
and
from
underneath
it
falls
a
bottle
of
beer
it's
contents
foaming
out
drunk
willow
laughs
and
picks
up
the
bottle
drunk
i
mean
that's
such
aa
strong
word
kind
of
a
guttural
anglosaxon
word
drunk
will
not
loving
the
drowning
of
the
sorrows
not
drowning
—
wading
aaand

still
with

asleep

and

trunk
containing

bathroom
willow
has
a
circle
of
red
candles
surrounding
her
an
incense
censer
a
bowlpentacle
in

a
goblet

drops
something
into

bowlpentacle
in

goblet
into
the
bowlpentacle
a
flicker
of
electricity

her
to

candles
and
all
of
the
flames
rise
high
signifying
the
spell's
success
cut
to
the
dorm
room
the
next
morning
buffy
is
gone
willow
is
looking
at
herself
in
a
mirror
it
is
my
will
that
my
heart
be
healed
now
willow
she
sighs
and
puts
the
mirror
down
when
nothing
happens
picks
up
the
spellbook
i
will
that
this
book
speak
it's
words
to
me
willow
she
sighs
again
putting
the
book
down
when
nothing
happens
she
picks
up
a
bent
qtip
i
will
that
this
qtip
gets
unbendy
there's
a
knock
at
the
door
come
in
giles
enters
looking
slightly
worried
giles
what
are
you
doing
here
i'm
a
bit
concerned
about
you
actually
did
buffy
tell
you
about
the
beer
'cause
uh
buffy
didn't
tell
me
anything
oh
well
forget
the
beer
part
then
happily
i
came
because
we
had
an
appointment
the
other
day
oh
right
right
the
truth
spell
yes
um
willow
i
know
that
you're
going
through
a
very
difficult
time
but
shirking
your
responsibilities—
but
i
didn't
—
shirk
i
did
the
research
and
i
picked
up
the
motherwort
i
just
forgot
the
doing
the
spell
part
well
that
isn't
like
you
at
all
i
know
ii've
been
off
ii
even
tried
to
do
a
spell
last
night
to
have
my
will
done
i
was
hoping
it
would
make
me
feel
better
but
it
just
went
kablooey
a
spell
i
don't
think
it's
wise
for
you
to
be
doing
that
alone
right
now
your
energy's
too
unfocused
well
that's
not
true
i
said
i
was
off
not
incompetent
i
only
meant
that
you're
grieving
and
it
might
be
wise
if
you
took
a
break
from
doing
spells
without
supervision
so
i
get
punished
‘cause
i'm
in
pain
it's
not
punishment
i'm
only
saying
this
because
i—
oh
you
care
yeah
everybody
cares
nobody
wants
to
be
inconvenienced
you
all
want
me
to
take
the
time
and
go
through
the
pain
as
long
as
you
don't
have
to
hear
about
it
anymore
no
that's
not
fair
isn't
it
‘cause
i'm
doing
the
best
i
can
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
enough
for
you
guys
and
i
see
how
you
could
feel
that
way
i
do—
no
you
don't
you
say
that
you
do
but
you
don't
see
anything
her
eyes
take
on
a
strange
blue
gleam
as
she
speaks
the
words
giles
removes
his
glasses
suddenly
finding
his
vision
a
bit
blurred
um
oh
sorry
um
sorry
pperhaps
i'd
better
be
going
let's
um
let's
talk
about
this
later
he
leaves
walking
down
the
hall
in
a
bit
of
a
daze
he
runs
into
a
student
oh
i'm
sorry
so
sorry
he
puts
his
glasses
back
on
quite
confused
with
what
is
happening
cut
to
spike
and
giles
in
giles'
living
room
spike
is
still
chained
up
but
sitting
on
the
floor
giles
is
walking
around
him
holding
a
bundle
of
burning
herbs
and
reading
from
a
book
elobe
enemy
be
now
quiet
you
know
not
too
keen
about
this
spell
stuff
tends
to
be
a
bit
unpredictable
yes
well
you
might
have
thought
about
that
sooner
um
giles
continues
reading
let
your
deceitful
tongue
be
giles
has
trouble
with
he
words
be
uh
let
no
untruths
be
spoken
he's
having
a
very
hard
time
making
out
the
words
now
he
gets
frustrated
and
sets
the
book
down
taking
out
a
handkerchief
and
cleaning
his
glasses
spike
who
has
been
watching
this
cautiously
glances
down
and
sees
the
key
to
the
chains
by
giles'
feet
he
slowly
reaches
for
it
with
his
boot
hey
what's
that
all
about
hm
oh
nothing
i
just
got
ash
in
my
eye
well
i
won't
have
you
doin'
mojo
on
me
if
you
can't
read
properly
you
might
turn
me
into
a
stink
beetle
or
what
all
t'would
be
a
generous
ending
for
you
spike
spike
grabs
the
key
and
unlocks
himself
he
jumps
up
pushes
giles
out
of
the
way
and
runs
out
the
door
cut
to
willow
and
buffy's
dorm
willow
is
playing
with
amy
the
rat
on
her
bed
i
mean
i'm
going
through
something
i
just
don't
see
why
he
was
getting
down
on
me
giles
just
worries
spells
can
be
dangerous
it
doesn't
mean
he
thinks
you're
a
bad
witch
i
am
a
bad
witch
no
you're
a
good
witch
i'm
not
kidding
anyone
if
i
had
any
real
power
i
could
have
made
oz
stay
with
me
will
you
wouldn't
have
wanted
him
to
have
stayed—
and
i
didn't
have
the
guts
to
do
the
spell
on
veruca
and
my
i
will
it
so
spell
went
nowhere
the
only
real
witch
here
is
fuzzy
little
amy
i
think
you're
being
a
too
hard
on
yourself
she's
got
access
to
powers
i
can't
even
invoke
i
mean
first
—
she's
a
perfectly
normal
girl
rat
morphs
to
naked
amy
on
willow's
bed
amy
smiles
excitedly
then
poof
—
she's
a
rat
amy
morphs
back
into
a
rat
i
could
never

the
blue
glow
thing

cut
to
spike
standing
outside

to
the
ground
which
is
covered
with
grass
no
sign
of
a
door
of
any
kind
just
a
lawn
buffy
incredulous

at
the
ground

punches
her
in
the
nose
then

punches
him
back
in
the
nose
he
yells
in
pain
again
cut
to
giles
in
his
bathroom

in
his
eyes

and

barging
in
through

to
bathroom
giles

distracted
uhuhum
just
a
minute
cut
to
xander's
basement
willow's
pacing
back
and
forth
complaining
about
buffy
xander
sits
idly
by
and
listens
i
mean
i'm
going
through
something
you'd
think
every
once
in
a
while
buffy
would
make
best
friends
a
priority
you
know
will
it's
not
like
she
could
just
let
spike
go
cut
to
giles'
living
room
buffy
slams
spike
down
into
a
chair
spike
sneering
i
get
this
spell
reversed
they'll
be
finding
your
body
for
weeks
oh
make
a
move
—
please
i'm
dying
for
a
good
slay
they
glare
at
each
other
cut
back
to
xander's
basement
spike's
more
important
than
me
i
get
it
buffy's
gotta
find
out
what's
up
with
those
commandos
right
now
she
needs
spike
well
fine
why
doesn't
so
just
go
marry
him
willow's
eyes
go
blueglowy
cut
to
giles'
apartment
giles
comes
out
of
the
bathroom
if
the
two
of
you
could
remain
civil
long
enough
to—
cut
to
buffy
sitting
in
the
chair
spike
was
once
occupying
spike
on
his
knees
in
front
of
her
holding
her
hand
it's
just
so
sudden
i
don't
know
what
to
say
just
say
yes
and
make
me
the
happiest
man
on
earth
oh
spike
of
course
it's
yes
they
embrace
and
kiss
and
it's
overall
mushy
giles
walks
forward
and
takes
off
his
glasses
quite
baffled
by
the
whole
thing
buffy
sees
giles
giles
you'll
never
believe
what's
happened
buffy
holds
up
her
now
ringed
ringfinger
giles
just
stares
like
he's
gone
crazy
cut
to
xander's
basement
it's
just
not
fair
willow
i
know
it's
hard
to
see
it
right
now
but
everything
you're
feeling
is
because
of
you
and
oz
not
because
of
buffy
and
me
or
anybody
but
eventually
you'll
meet
somebody
else
and
it'll
be
better
yeah
‘cause
most
relationships
are
great
and
troublefree
i
don't
think
so
i
think
we're
all
doomed
to
badness
we're
not
doomed
oh
yeah
let'slet's
look
at
your
bio
insect
lady
mummy

anya
you're
a
demon
magnet
i
was
just
trying
to
help

need
your
help

can't
see
very
well
everything's
blurred
giles
grabs
the
scotch
i'm
certain
it's
a
spell
of
some
kind
because
wellit
seems
something
else
is
going
wrong
cut
to
buffy
bring
spike
a
mug
of
blood
she
sits
on
his
lap
here
you
go
986
buffy
they
kiss
horribly
wrong
there's
so
much
to
decide
ceremony
guests
reception
well
first
thing
i'd
say
we're
not
having
a
church
wedding
how
'bout
a
daytime
ceremony
in
the
park
fabulous
enjoy
your
honeymoon
with
the
big
pile
of
dust
under
the
trees
indirect
sunlight
only
giles
makes
his
way
carefully
into
the
living
room
glass
of
scotch
in
hand
he
takes
a
seat
on
the
couch
warm
breeze
tosses
the
leaves
aside
and
again
—
you're
registering
as
mr
and
mrs
bigpileofdust
stop

this
is
our
wedding
and
you're
treating
it
like
a
big
joke
oh
pouty
look
at
that
lip
gonna
get
it
gonna
get
it
she
giggles
and
they
kiss
and
such
buffy
playfully
oh
stop
yes
please
stop
giles
takes
a
good
swig
of
his
drink
buffy
holds
her
hand
out
in
giles'
direction
giles
did
you
see
my
ring
thankfully
not
very
well
giles
leans
back
and
rubs
his
eyes
buffy
gets
up
from
spike's
lap
and
goes
to
sit
beside
giles
i'm
not
crazy
and
i
know
that
you
probably
don't
approve
and
my
father's
not
that
far
away
i
mean
he
could—
but
this
day
is
about
family
—
my
real
family
—
and
i
would
like
you
to
be
the
one
to
give
me
away
giles
touched
oh
buffy
that's
that's
so
giles
comes
to
his
senses
oh
for
god's
sake
this
is
nonsense
something
is
making
you
act
this
way
don't
you
realize
what
you're
doing
she
smiles
and
looks
back
at
spike
living
a
dream
he's
gonna
have
to
take
a
bit
of
time
to
get
used
to
it
pet
they
all
will
buffy
turns
back
to
giles
but
you
guys
weren't
crazy
about
angel
at
first
either
spike
gets
upset
you
weren't
gonna
say
that
name
sorry
why
don't
we
talk
about
where
we're
going
to
register
well
where
would
angel
like
to
register
and
can
we
have
the
photographer
angel
would've
wanted
and
flowers
angel
would
have
liked
buffy
stands
hey
you
think
i
don't
live
with
the
shadow
of
drusilla
over
my
head
that
i'm
not
wondering
if
you're
going
to
be
thinking
of
her
on
our
honeymoon
when
you're
making
sweet
love
to
me
she
walks
to
spike
and
sits
in
his
lap
they
you
guessed
it
kiss
giles
reaches
for
his
glass
of
scotch
knocking
it
to
the
floor
giles
are
you
okay
i
rather
think
not
i
seem
to
be
rather
rather
blind
completely
in
fact
buffy
walks
over
to
him
concerned
what
how
could
this
happen
she
waves
her
hand
in
front
of
his
face
spike
stands
and
walks
to
the
bookshelf
a
spell
i
believe
well
we'll
fix
it
don't
worry
what
you
want
is
a
general
reversal

my
fatherinlaw

gonna
be
spike'll
even
take
care
of
you
while
i'm
at
the
magick
shop
buffy
stands
and
walks
to
spike
who
takes
her
in
his
arms
from
now
on
we're
a
family
they
kiss
giles
gets
all
panicky
he
stands
and
wobbles
his
way
to
the
kitchen
that's
alright
i
have
more
scotch
cut
to
buffy
exiting
the
magick
shop
she
stops
in
the
middle
of
the
street
staring
at
a
window
display
of
a
beautiful
wedding
gown
she
walks
over
to
it
memorized
in
the
background
we
see
riley
walking
by
he
sees
her
and
walks
up
hey
buffy
what's
up
buffy
turns
back
staring
at
the
dress
riley
look
—
aren't
they
beautiful
um

nice
a
little
dressy
maybe
for
school
but
buffy
walks
towards
him
riley
buffy
i
really
like
you
i
hope
you
know
that
you
mean
a
lot
to
me
and
if
things
were
different—
different
than
what
she
takes
his
hand
he
looks
rightly
confused
i
want
you
to
promise
me
that
we
can
always
be
friends
and
i'd
really
like
you
to
be
there
on

a
strong
enough
word
i
know
it's
crazy
i
mean
we
fought
for
all
these
years
and
then
sometimes
you
just
look
at
someone
and
you
know
you
know
no
i
think
maybe
we
fought
because
we
couldn't
admit
how
we
really
felt
about
each
other
riley
confused
can
we
start
again
you'll
really
like
him
well
nobody
really
likes
him
i
just
need

a
few
things
up
i
don't
even
really
like
him
buffy
but
i
love

spike
buffy
laughs
oh

old
as
my
last
boyfriend
was
riley
befuddled
okay
it's
late
and
i'm
i'm
very
tired
now
so
i'm
just
gonna
go
far
away
and
be
away
but—
no

riley
walks
off
looking
extremely
confused
buffy
just
stands
there
watching
him
go
a
forlorn
look
on
her
face
you're
ruining
my
happy
day
cut
to
xander's
basement
that's
okay
mom
—
we
don't
need
anymore
snacks
i
liked
those
fruit
rollups
shush
i
thought
she'd
never
clear
out
besides
just
think
of
my
lips
as
the
fruit
rollups
of
love
xander
pause
okay
that
was
gross
i'm
a
little
distracted
willow
was
really
upset
i
shouldn't
have
let
her
go
away
mad
anya
grabs
him
and
kisses
him
hard
regaining
focus
we
just
got
rid
of
your
mom
let's
not
bring
willow
into
this
it's
time
for
just
the
two
of
us
they
kiss
and
fall
down
on
the
bed
suddenly
a
demon
busts
through
the
side
door
they
jump
up
xander
runs
at
the
demon
and
it
tosses
him
aside
anya
goes
after
it
with
a
bat
but
it
grabs
the
bat
from
her
xander
jumps
back
up
grabs
his
clothesline
and
tries
to
strangle
the
thing
no
no
it's
a
pargo
demon
drowning
it's
the
only
way
to
kill
it
they
drag
the
thing
over
to
the
sink
shoving
it's
head
underwater
as
soon
as
the
demon
drowns
another
busts
through
the
window
above
the
sink
what
the
hell
is
going
on
xander
grabs
anya
and
they
run
off
cut
to
giles'
apartment
buffy
is
holding
the
cake
topper—
a
man
and
a
woman
both
blonde—
and
walking
them
up
spike's
arm
humming
the
wedding
march
duh
dum
dada
duh
dum
dada
duh
dum
da
da
dum
da
da
dum
da
da
giles
is
laying
on
the
couch
a
towel
over
his
eyes
so
the
plan
is
to
cure
my
total
incapacitating
blindness
tomorrow
buffy
unconcerned
they
were
all
out
of
tagas
root
at
the
magick
shop
they'll
have
more
tomorrow
i'm
completely
on
top
of
it
looks
to
spike
holding
the
figurines
up
aren't
they
a
perfect
little
us
i
don't
like
him
he's
insipid
clearly
human
oo
red
paint
we
could
smear
a
little
on
his
mouth
—
blood
of
the
innocent
that's
my
girl
he
grabs
the
back
of
her
head
and
pulls
her
into
a
kiss
stop
that
right
now
i
can
hear
the
smacking
buffy
and
spike
stop
buffy
sets
the
figurines
down
and
picks
up
a
notebook
from
the
table
honey
we
need
to
talk
about
the
invitations
now
do
you
wanna
be
william
the
bloody
or
just
spike
‘cause
either
way
it's
gonna
look
majorly
weird
whereas
the
name
buffy
gives
it
that
touch
of
classic
elegance
what's
wrong
with
buffy
huh
such
a
good
question
spike
ignoring
giles
well
it's
a
terrible
name
my
mother
gave
me
that
name
your
mother
yeah
she's
a
genius
don't
you
start
in
on
my
mother
anya
and
xander
suddenly
burst
through
the
front
door
everyone
stands
as
xander
pulls
a
bookshelf
in
front
of
the
door
board
up
the
windows
and
barricade
the
doors
what's
going
on
demons
they
keep
coming
and
coming
i
think
we
lost
them
but
i
couldn't
see
xander
sees
spike
spike
he's
all
untied
xander
pauses
which
you
probably
noticed
xander
calm
down
okay
if
you
lost
them
that'll
give
us
some
time
to
figure
this
out
buffy
to
spike
maybe
the
demons
have
something
to
do
with
giles
being
blind
giles
is
blind
xander
walks
over
to
giles
and
starts
waving
his
fingers
in
front
of
giles'
face
please
stop
whatever
you're
doing
you
smell
like
fruit
rollups
this
is
the
crack
team
that
foils
my
every
plan
i
am
deeply
shamed
buffy
hanging
on
spike's
arm
spike's
right
we
really
should
get
organized
xander
and
anya
are
staring
at
spike
and
buffy
why
are
you
holding
hands
buffy
and
spike
look
at
each
other
lovingly
they
have
to
hear
it
sooner
or
later
buffy
excitedly
spike
and
i
are
getting
married
xander
baffled
how
what
how
three
excellent
questions
spike
to
buffy
what
are
you
lookin'
at
the
man
i
love
they
kiss
a
lot
anya
and
xander
look
a
bit
disgusted
can
i
be
blind
too
anya
nods
in
agreement
wait
married
i
know
something
what
is
it
everything's
so
familiar
work
brain
—
work
oh
oh
oh
willow
buffy
talking
around
the
kissing
mmwhat
about
will
mmm
honey
get
off
buffy
pulls
away
from
spike
something
about
willow
and
her
griefypoorme
mood
swings
—
so
so
tired
of
it
you
mean
i
don't
have
to
be
nice
about
her
anymore
well
we're
all
tired
of
it
but
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
what's
going
on
she
told
me
i
was
a
demon
magnet
aand
you
two
should
get
married
xander
gestures
to
spike
and
buffy
giles
coming
to
realization
and
that
i
didn't
see
anything
she
did
a
spell
yes
to
have
her
will
done
whatever
she
says
is
coming
true
and
you
both
were
effected
i
probably
only
escaped
because
i'm
the
slayer
some
kind
of
natural
immunity
yeah
right
you're
marrying
spike
because
you're
so
right
for
each
other
xander
that's
it
—
you're
off
the
usher
list
people
willow
is
out
there
and
she
probably
doesn't
know
what
she's
doing
we
gotta
find
her
before
somebody
gets
really
hurt
giles
nods
in
agreement
and
starts
forward
falling
over
his
couch
and
landing
on
the
other
side
cut
to
willow
walking
down
the
hallway
in
stevenson
hall
she
walks
into
her
room
and
is
snatched
up
by
a
demon
placing
one
hand
on
each
side
of
her
head
causing
electricitylike
bolts
to
wind
around
her
head
cut
to
buffy
spike
xander
and
anya
walking
down
the
hallways
of
stevenson

indicating
spike
xander
spike

going
to
be
my
husband

of
work

a
look
of
horror
and
disgust
passing
over
their
faces

up

wiping
their
mouth
and
gagging
and
carrying
on
