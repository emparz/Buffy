the
summers
house
at
night
cut
to
xander
in
buffy's
room
weird
hindi
music
and
singing
is
coming
from
the
tv
is
she
dying
the
camera
pans
past
willow
over
to
buffy
she
and
xander
are
lying
on
the
bed
willow
is
sitting
on
the
floor
letting
them
braid
her
hair
i
think
she's
singing
to
a
telephone
in
hindi
now
that's
entertainment
the
hindi
woman
on
tv
dances
around
the
room
while
singing
into
the
phone
why
is
she
singing
she's
sad
because
her
lover
gave
her
twelve
gold
coins
but
then
the
wizard
cut
open
the
bag
of
salt
and
now
the
dancing
minions
have
nowhere
to
put
their
big
maypole
fish
thing
willow
takes
a
sip
of
her
drink
uhhuh
why
is
she
singing
her
lover
i
thought
that
was
her
chiropractor
because
of
that
thing
he
did
with
her
feet
no
that
was
personal
hmm
and
we
thought
just
because
we
didn't
have
any
money
or
anyplace
to
go
this
would
be
a
lackluster
evening
i
know
we
could
go
to
the
bronze
and
sneak
in
our
own
tea
bags
and
ask
for
hot
water
willow
smiles
hop
off
the
outlaw
train
will
before
you
land
us
all
in
jail
i
for
one
am
giddy
and
up
there's
a
kinda
hush
all
over
sunnydale
no
demons
or
vampires
to
slay
i'm
here
with
my
friends
buffy
tilts
her
head
at
the
tv
so
how
does
the
water
buffalo
fit
in
again
xander
shakes
his
head
cut
to
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
delta
zeta
kappa
fraternity
house
the
camera
pans
along
the
grass
and
then
up
to
the
house
cut
to
the
balcony
a
girl
crashes
through
the
glass
door
she
rolls
over
the
balcony
railing
and
doesn't
hesitate
to
drop
to
the
ground
below
a
fraternity
brother
in
a
dark
hooded
robe
rushes
out
onto
the
balcony
after
her
when
he
sees
that
she
jumped
he
quickly
goes
back
inside
cut
to
the
girl
on
the
ground
now
she
gets
up
apparently
not
hurt
in
the
fall
and
begins
to
run
as
fast
as
she
can
five
brothers
all
wearing
robes
come
streaming
out
of
the
house
after
her
she
runs
into
the
trees
looks
around
for
which
way
to
go
and
makes
tracks
for
the
wall
to
the
north
just
as
she
reaches
it
she
trips
and
falls
but
quickly
gets
up
climbs
a
low
tree
branch
and
jumps
over
to
the
wall
she
shimmies
over
the
top
and
drops
down
the
other
side
into
the
cemetery
the
fraternity
brothers
follow
her
over
the
wall
one
by
one
she
runs
through
the
cemetery
for
all
she's
worth
as
the
boys
give
chase
one
of
the
brothers
is
waiting
ahead
of
her
and
she
runs
into
him
and
screams
callie
callie
where're
you
going
the
party's
just
getting
started
she
sobs
uncontrollably
as
he
shoves
her
over
to
the
others
and
they
take
her
away
he
has
a
look
around
to
make
sure
no
one
saw
pulls
his
hood
over
his
head
and
follows
them
back
to
the
house
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

sunnydale
high
school
cut
to
the
hall
cordelia
is
demonstrating
her
fake
laugh
to
another
girl
cordelia
fake
laughter
see
dr
debi
says
when
a
man
is
speaking
you
make
serious
eye
contact
and
you
really
really
listen
and
you
laugh
at
everything
he
says
cordelia
laughs
again
cut
to
the
stairs
willow
and
buffy
come
down
and
head
down
the
hall
you
dreamed
about
angel
again
third
night
in
a
row
what
did
he
do
in
the
dream
stuff
willow
smiles
wide
oh
stuff
willow
buffy
smiles
was
it
one
of
those
vivid
dreams
where
you
could
feel
his
lips
and
smell
his
hair
it
had
surround
sound
i'm
just
thinking
about
him
so
much
lately
you
two
are
so
right
for
each
other
except
for
the
uh
vampire
thing
that
doesn't
make
him
a
bad
person
necessarily
i'm
brainsick
i
can't
have
a
relationship
with
him
not
during
the
day
but
you
could
ask
him
for
coffee
some
night
it's
the
nonrelationship
drink
of
choice
xander
comes
out
of
a
classroom
sees
them
and
hurries
to
catch
up
it's
not
a
date
it's
a
caffeinated
beverage
okay
sure
it's
hot
and
bitter
like
a
relationship
that
way
but
what's
like
a
relationship
nothing
i
have
coffee
huh
he
stops
by
cordelia
as
willow
and
buffy
get
a
drink
at
the
fountain
cordelia
to
the
girl
there's
really
no
comparison
between
college
men
and
high
school
boys
cordelia
looks
up
at
xander
i
mean
look
at
that
so
cor
you're
datin'
college
guys
now
well
not
that
it's
any
of
your
business
but
i
happen
to
be
dating
a
delta
zeta
kappa
oh
an
extraterrestrial
so
that's
how
you
get
a
date
after
you
exhausted
all
the
human
guys
you'll
go
to
college
someday
xander
i
just
know
your
pizza
delivery
career
will
take
you
so
many
exciting
places
xander
has
no
comeback
for
that
and
joins
the
girls
at
the
drinking
fountain
buffy
and
willow
have
smiles
on
their
faces
from
overhearing
the
bell
rings
buffy
remembering
oh
i
told
giles
i'd
meet
him
in
the
library
ten
minutes
ago
aw
he
won't
be
upset
there
hasn't
been
much
paranormal
activity
lately
she
heads
for
the
library
cut
to
the
library
giles
paces
while
he
lectures
her
just
because
the
paranormal
is
more
normal
and
less
para
of
late
is
no
excuse
for
tardiness
or
letting
your
guard
down
i
haven't
let
my
guard
down

your
way
through

swings
his
arm
over
her
shoulder
from
behind
but
she
grabs
it
and
pulls
it
behind
his
back
forcing
him
to
bend
over
and
wince
in
pain
she
has
a
bored
look
on
her
face
giles
in
pain
yeah

i'm
not
a
demon
which
is
why
you
should
let
go
now
she
lets
him
go
giles
quietly
thank
you
he
straightens
up
and
rubs
his
wrist
when
you
live
on
top
of
a
a
mystical
convergence
it's
only
a
matter
of
time
before
a
fresh
hell
breaks
loose
now
is
the
time
that
you
should
train
more
strictly

hunt
and
patrol
more
keenly

stick
at
her
she
sidesteps
him
and
the
end
of
the
stick
hits
the
floor
she
pins
his
arm
down
and
stomps
on
the
stick
breaking
it
he
tries
to
lunge
at
her
but
she
sidesteps
again
and
he
runs
into

table
and

good
so
um

to
the
cemetery
at
night
buffy
strolls
through
keeping
a
careful
watch
she
spots
a
bracelet
on
the
ground
and
bends
down
to
pick
it
up
angel
suddenly
appears
behind
her
there's
blood
on
it
buffy
gets
up
startled
and
faces
him
hi
it's
nice
to
blood
i
can
smell
it
oh
buffy
looks
at
the
bracelet
it's
pretty
thin
it
probably
belonged
to
a
girl
probably
buffy
exhales
ii
was
just
thinking
wouldn't
it
be
funny
some
time
to
see
each
other
when
it
wasn't
a
blood
thing
buffy
smiles
briefly
not
funny
ha
ha
what
are
you
sayin'

have
a
date
no
you
don't
wanna
have
a
date

just
wanna
have
coffee
or
somethin'
buffy

starts
to
walk
past
him
angel
bumps
into
her
listen
if
we
date
you
and
i
both
know
one
thing's
gonna
lead
to
another
one
thing
already
has
led
to
another
you
think
it's
a
little
late
to
be
reading
me
a
warning
label
i'm
just
tryin'
to
protect
you
this
could
get
outta
control
isn't
that
the
way
it's
supposed
to
be
he
grabs
her
by
the
shoulders
and
pulls
her
closer
she
draws
a
startled
breath
this
isn't
some
fairy
tale
when
i
kiss
you
you
don't
wake
up
from
a
deep
sleep
and
live
happily
ever
after
no
when
you
kiss
me
i
wanna
die

pulls
herself
free
and
runs
off

to

the
next
morning

over
and
the

up
from

into
the
room
buffy
did
you

respect
you
too
much
to
be
dishonest
the
hair's
a
little
cordelia
smiles
widely
well
that
really
isn't
the
point
here
is
it
the
zeta
kappas
have
to
have
a
certain
balance
at
their
party
and
richard
explained
it
all
to
me
but
i
was
so
busy
really
listening
that
i
didn't
hear
much
anyway
the
deal

drink
and
picks
it
up
again
love
is
in
the
air
she
stirs
it
idly
for
a
moment

looks
around

by
louie
says

toward
her
new

wideeyed
surprise
when

into
her
he
looks
up
surprised
at
her
disappearance
he
sees
another
girl
walk
by
and
follows
her
instead
if
she
bends
then
she
breaks
thanks

loves
you

she
takes
it
away

but
there's
such
a
thing
as
being
too
mature
she
loves
you

she
takes
it
away

yourself
once
in
a
while

she
bows

too
mature
