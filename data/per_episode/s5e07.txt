all
is
quiet
in
the
mistshrouded
graveyard
suddenly
the
peace
is
shattered
as
buffy
pounds
a
vampire
dressed
like
a
van
halen
reject
to
the
ground
you
know
it's
probably
none
of
my
business
but
i
just
gotta
ask
the
vampire
lunges
at
her
and
she
backhands
it
you
smell
this
bad
when
you
were
alive
she
kicks
the
vampire
into
a
headstone
'cause
if
it's
a
postmortem
thing
then
boy
is
my
face
red
she
flips
him
over
the
headstone
and
whips
out
a
stake
but
just
so
you
know
the
fastgrowing
field
of
personal
grooming
has
come
a
long
way
since
you
became
a
vampire
buffy
somersaults
over
the
headstone
stake
raised
and
ready
to
strike
but
the
vampire
seizes
her
arm
as
she
lands
spins
her
around
and
plunges
the
stake
into
buffy's
abdomen
her
eyes
go
wide
with
shock
and
pain
as
she
looks
down
at
the
stake
protruding
from
her
body

resume
buffy
looks
down
in
horror
at
the
stake
in
her
gut
she
grips
the
shaft
and
with
a
gasp
of
pain
pulls
it
out
her
sweater
is
soaked
with
her
blood
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
buffy
feels
fear
she
turns
and
flees
trying
to
escape
the
vampire
the
hunter
had
become
the
hunted
her
wound
slows
her
however
and
she
casts
terrified
glances
over
her
shoulder
suddenly
the
vampire
leaps
in
front
of
her
and
she
stops
with
a
gasp
looking
around
desperately
for
an
escape
route
you're
going
but
you
were
having
so
much
fun
a
minute
ago
buffy
brings
the
stake
up
but
the
creature
easily
knocks
it
from
her
grasp
and
tosses
her
against
a
nearby
crypt
she
doubles
over
in
pain
as
the
vampire
picks
up
her
stake
and
approaches
with
a
predatory
grin
buffy
is
helpless
she
realizes
that
this
is
the
moment
she's
been
dreading
but
always
knew
would
come
she's
going
to
die
as
the
vampire
raises
the
stake
for
the
killing
blow
he's
suddenly
tackled
to
the
ground
by
riley
he
rains
blows
down
on
the
demon
and
takes
out
a
taser
but
the
vampire
knocks
it
from
his
hand
before
he
can
use
it
and
takes
off
across
the
graveyard
riley
is
about
to
give
chase
when
he
notices
buffy's
obvious
distress
and
rushes
to
her
aid
buffy
what
happened
she
holds
up
her
bloody
hands
then
collapses
in
arms
unconscious

riley
moves
stealthily
among
the
headstones
ducking
from
shadow
to
shadow
he
pauses
behind
a
large
marble
slab
and
raises
his
arm
fist
closed
and
pumps
it
up
and
down
twice
before
moving
further
into
the
cemetery
willow
anya
and
xander
follow
about
twenty
yards
behind
him
munching
potato
chips
and
making
no
effort
to
conceal
themselves
xander
to
willow
what's
with
the
hand
move
does
that
like
mean
something
it's
code
i
think
it
breaks
down
to
choochoo
she
mimics
pulling
a
train
whistle
it
means
to
follow
him
that
or
wait
here
for
him
they
watch
riley's
covert
movements
for
a
moment
then
willow
turns
to
xander
ask
xander
yells
hey
riley
what's
the
xander
hand
gesture
all
about
riley
exasperated
it
means
yell
real
loud
so
the
vampires
who
don't
know
we're
coming
will
have
a
sporting
chance
xander
to
willow
see
now
he's
all
mean
and
sarcastic
that's
because
you
were
doing
all
the
yelling
mr
stealthypants
anya
to
riley
it's
their
fault
guys
i'm
thinking
if
we
split
up
we
could
cover
more
ground
tell
you
what
i'll
take
the
cemeteries
you
guys
get
the
bronze
are
we
not
being
covert
enough
we're
sorry
sorry
we'll
be
sneakier
promise
he
munches
loudly
on
a
handful
of
chips
okay
just
ditch
the
chips
and
watch
my
back
done
she
reaches
into
the
bag
and
grabs
a
handful
of
chips
herself
before
setting
the
bag
down
riley
moves
off
into
the
cemetery
again
xander
to
anya
you
know
what
he's
like
he's
like
a
cat
you
know
a
big
jungle
cat
how
come
i'm
not

that
it's
just
so
cool

cut
to

int
the
magic
box
night
5
the
reading
table
is
piled
high
with
books
giles
and
buffy
are
into
some
deep
research
here's
another
one
early
18th
century
slayer
buffy
closes
her
book
with
a
sigh
and
sets
it
on
the
stack
good
let's
hope
she'll
be
more
helpful
than
this
last
one
why
what
does
it
say
same
as
all
the
others
slayer
called
blah
blah
great
protector
blah
blah
scary
battles
blah
blah
oops
she's
dead
where
are
the
details
details
well
it
says
this
slayer
forged
her
own
weapons
he
hands
the
book
to
buffy
gotta
love
a
gal
with
an
anvil
but
where
are
the
details
of
the
slayer's
last
battle
you
know
what
made
that
fight
special
why
did
she
lose
you
didn't
lose
last
night
buffy
you
just
got
really
close
i
slipped
up
giles
i've
been
training
harder
than
ever
and
still
i
buffy
beat
and
there's
nothing
in
any
of
these
books
to
help
me
understand
why
i
mean
look
i
realize
that
every
slayer
comes
with
an
expiration
mark
on
the
package
but
i
want
mine
to
be
a
long
time
from
now
like
a
cheeto
if
there
were
just
a
few
good
descriptions
of
what
took
out
the
other
slayers
maybe
it
would
help
me
to
understand
my
mistake
to
keep
it
from
happening
again
yes
well
the
problem
is
after
a
final
battle
it's
difficult
to
get
any
well
the
slayer's
not
she's
rather
it's
okay
to
use
the
dword
giles
dead
and
hence
not
very
forthcoming
why
didn't
the
watchers
keep
fuller
accounts
of
it
the
journals
just
stop
well
i
suppose
if
they're
anything
like
me
they
just
find
the
whole
subject
too
unseemly
damn
love
ya
but
you
watchers
are
such
prigs
sometimes
painful
i
was
going
to
say
buffy
and
giles
share
a
meaningful
look
but
you're
right
accounts
of
the
final
battles
would
be
very
helpful
but
there's
no
one
left
to
tell
the
tales
buffy
has
a
sudden
revelation
what
cut

int
spike's
crypt
night

buffy

while
buffy

a
few
american
beers
that
are
highly
underrated
this
unfortunately
is
not
one
of
them
update
spike
we're
not
here
to
discuss
the
fine
choice
of
hops
it's
about
two
slayers
one
in
china
during
the
boxer
rebellion
one
in
new
york
she
holds
up
a
wad
of
cash
and

cash

up

plate
i'm
feelin'
peckish
buffy
sighs
and
turns
to
signal
a
waitress
excuse
me
the
movement
aggravates
her
injury
and
she
winces
in
pain
as
i
thought

nasty
thing
got
a
taste
of
you
don't
get

victorian
parlor
night

a
very
different
spike
is
sitting
and
composing
poetry
off
in
the
corner
of
a
dinner
party
the
spirited
laughter
of
the
partygoers
can
be
heard
in
the
background
spike's
hair
is
long
and
unruly
and
he's
dressed
as
a
proper
gentleman
complete
with
tie
and
reading
spectacles
he's
awkward
and
bookish
none
of
the
confident
swagger
we're
used
to
spike
to
himself
luminous
oh
no
no
no
irradiant's
better
a
waiter
approaches
and
holds
out
a
tray

for
an
hors

sir
oh
quickly
i'm
the
very
spirit
of
vexation
what's
another
word
for
gleaming
it's
a
perfectly
perfect
word
as
many
words
go
but
the
bother
is
nothing
rhymes
you
see
the
waiter
smiles
patronizingly
and
moves
off
into
the
crowd
spike's
eyes
are
drawn
to
cecily
young
woman
just
entering
the
party
cecily
he
turns
back
to
his
poem
with
renewed
purpose
and
jots
down
several
more
lines
then
gets
up
and
moves
through
the
crowd
toward
her

cut
to
a
group
of
young
aristocrats
a
woman
and
her
two
male
companions
are
gathered
discussing
current
events
i
mean
to
point
out
that
it's
something
of
a
mystery
and
the
police
should
keep
an
open
mind
one
of
the
men
turns
to
spike
as
he
passes
by
aristocrat

to

ah

do
you

a
sour
look
snatches
back
his
poem
and
follows
her
and
that's
actually
one
of
his
better
compositions
have
you
heard
they
call
him
william
the
bloody
because
of
his
bloody
awful
poetry
it
suits
him
i'd
rather
have
a
railroad
spike
through
my
head
than
listen
to
that
awful
stuff
cut

approaches
cecily
who
is
sitting
on
a
sofa
away
from
the
main
party
and
looking
out
the
window
cecily
she
turns
and
sighs
when
she
sees
him
oh
leave
me
alone
oh
they're
vulgarians
they're
not
like
you
and
i
you
and
i
i'm
going
to
ask
you
a
very
personal
question
and
i
demand
an
honest
answer
do
you
understand
he
nods
your
poetry
it's
they're
not
written
about
me
are
they
they're
about
how
i
feel
yes
but
are
they
about
me
every
syllable
oh
god
oh
i
know
it's
sudden
and
please
if
they're
no
good
they're
only
words
but
the
feeling
behind
them
i
love
you
cecily
please
stop
i
know
i'm
a
bad
poet
but
i'm
a
good
man
and
all
i
ask
is
that
that
you
try
to
see
me
i
do
see
you
that's
the
problem
you're
nothing
to
me
william
you're

down

up
his

into

sitting
on

finishing

of
destroying
his

he
looks
up
at
the
sound
of
a
woman's
voice
to
find
drusilla
standing
serenely
in
the
dark
alley
with
him
and
i
wonder
what
possible
catastrophe
came
crashing
down
from
heaven
and
brought
this
dashing
stranger
to
tears
nothing
i
wish
to
be
alone
oh
i
see
you
a
man
surrounded
by
fools
who
cannot
see
his
strength
his

a
profound
and
powerful
experience
i

is

snaps
a

down

raising

stops

you're
gettin'

drops

the

was
the
subject
of
cold
sweat

i
never

i
was

how'd
you

should
ask
his

whips
out
and
takes
her
by
the
neck
she
instinctually
reacts
bringing
the

up
as
a
weapon
but

holds
her
at

the

must
always

his

the

already

he
shakes
his

returns

thing
we're

that
would

what

whispers
in

one

buffy
pushes
him
away
from

hey

wraps

around

pinning

against

spike
smiles
and
laughs
what
lesson
the
second
ask
the
right
questions
you
want
to
know
how
i
beat
'em
buffy
releases
him
and
steps
back
the
question
isn't
how'd
i
win
the
question
is
why'd
they
lose
what's
the
difference
spike
lunges
at
her
the
pool
cue
aimed
at
her
throat
spike
stops
it
inches
from
her
skin
buffy
never
even
flinches
there's
a
big
difference
love
buffy
kicks
the
cue
from
his
hands
how'd
you
kill
the
second
one
hmm
a
bit
like
this
he
sends
a
series
of
punches
at
her
but
buffy
easily
ducks
them
all
that
didn't
hurt
i
knew
i
couldn't
touch
you
if
there's
no
intent
to
hurt
you
then
that
chip
they
shoved
up
my
brain
never
activates
if
on
the
other
hand
spike's
face
changes
and
he
lunges
at
her
but
he's
brought
up
short
by
a
crippling
brain
seizure
see
now
that
hurt
yeah
this
hurt
too
buffy
gutpunches
him
then
pounds
him
to
the
ground
how'd
you
kill
'em
spike
he
jumps
up
and
attacks
but
buffy
flips
him
over
onto
the
ground
again
whips
out
a
stake
and
lands
on
top
of
him
spike
seizes
her
wrist
before
she
can
plunge
it
into
his
chest
you're
not
ready
to

to
buffy
the
first
was
all
business
but
the
second
she
had
a
touch
of
your
style
spike
and
the
slayer
trade
blows
this
slayer
does
indeed
fight
much
like
buffy
she
runs
spike
headfirst
into
the
train
car's
window
smashing
it
spike
looses
a
cry
of
delight
and
attacks
again
spike
to
buffy
she
was
cunning
resourceful
oh
did
i
mention
hot
i
could
have
danced
all
night
with
that
one
you
think
we're
dancing
that's
all
we've
ever
done
spike
breaks
one
of
the
subway
car's
handrails
and
wields
it
as
a
weapon
spike
vo
and
the
thing
about
the
dance
is
you
never
get
to
stop
spike
flips
the
pool
cue
up
and
spins
it
like
the
handrail
spike
to
buffy
every
day
you
wake
up
it's
the
same
bloody
question
that
haunts
you
is
today
the
day
i
die
he
brings
the
pool
cue
down
in
a
vicious
arc
and
buffy
counterattacks
enraged
spike
cracks
the
slayer
across
the
face
with
the
metal
rail
sending
her
reeling
to
the
floor
and
pounds
her
repeatedly
with
it
spike
vo
death
is
on
your
heels
baby
and
sooner
or
later
it's
gonna
catch
you
spike
brings
the
rail
down
for
another
blow
but
the
slayer
catches
it
and
slams
it
back
into
his
face
spike
to
buffy
and
part
of
you
wants
it
not
only
to
stop
the
fear
and
uncertainty
but
because
you're
just
a
little
bit
in
love
with
it
buffy
has
heard
enough
she
backhands
spike
across
the
face
on
the
subway
spike
falls
to
the
floor
and
the
slayer
jumps
on
his
chest
straddling
him
she
pounds
him
repeatedly
in
the
face
as
the
train
car's
lights
go
out
when
they
come
back
on
the
slayer
is
on
her
back
with
spike
straddling
her
his
hands
around
her
throat
death
is
your
art
you
make
it
with
your
hands
day
after
day
buffy
stares
at
him
her
face
a
blank
mask
the
slayer
struggles
beneath
spike
that
final
gasp
that
look
of
peace
part
of
you
is
desperate
to
know
what's
it
like
where
does
it
lead
you
and
now
you
see
that's
the
secret
not
the
punch
you
didn't
throw
or
the
kicks
you
didn't
land
every
slayer
has
a
death
wish
spike
grips
the
slayer's
head
between
his
hands
and
twists
violently
snapping
her
neck
and
killing
her
spike
to
buffy
even
you
spike
stands
up
and
faces
buffy
in
the
subway
he
walks
to
the
end
of
the
car
and
pulls
the
emergency
cord
as
the
train
grinds
to
a
halt
he
returns
to
the
dead
slayer
and
pulls
off
her
black
leather
coat
the
only
reason
you've
lasted
as
long
as
you
have
is
you've
got
ties
to
the
world
your
mum
your
brat
kid
sister
the
scoobies
they
all
tie
you
here
but
you're
just
putting
off
the
inevitable
spike
shrugs
into
the
slayer's
coat
sooner
or
later
you're
gonna
want
it
and
the
second
the
second
that
happens
spike
claps
his
hands
together
inches
from
buffy's
face
you
know
i'll
be
there
i'll
slip
in
have
myself
a
real
good
day
he
stares
intently
into
buffy's
eyes
then
steps
back
here
endeth
the
lesson
i
just
wonder
if
you'll
like
it
as
much
as
she
did
buffy
cold
get
out
of
my
sight
now
oh
did
i
scare
ya

the
slayer

about
it

good
swing

want
to
i
mean
it
so
do
i
give
it
me
good
buffy
do
it
the
tension
is
rising
between
them
spike
his
passion
aroused
spike
leans
in
to
kiss
her
she
backs
away
in
horror
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
he
grabs
buffy
by
the
arms
his
words
coming
in
a
breathless
pant
come
on
i
can
feel
it
slayer
you
know
you
want
to
dance
say
it's
true
say
i
do
want

she
shoves
him
to
the
ground
and
looks
down
at
him
with
disgust
it
wouldn't
be
you
spike
it
would
never
be
you
she
tosses
the
wad
of
cash
at
him
contemptuously
you're
beneath
me
buffy
turns
and
walks
off
into
the
night
leaving
spike
alone
in
the
dark
alley
he
begins
to
gather
up
the
money
stifling
a
sob
as
buffy's
words
ring
down
through
the
years
he
becomes
the
same
spurned
and
awkward
young
man
he
once
was
her
words
have
hurt
him
more
than
her
blows
ever
have
he
closes
his
eyes
in
anguish
takes
a
deep
breath
and
when
he
looks
up
again
only
murderous
hate
remains
cut
to
26
int
spike's
crypt
night
26
spike
throws
open
an
old
trunk
and
starts
searching
through
the
contents
harmony
looks
at
him
with
concern
spike
what
are
you
doing
spike
to
himself
beneath
me
i'll
show
her
he
takes
out
a
doublebarreled
shotgun
cracks
the
breech
and
loads
two
rounds
put
her
six
bloody
feet
beneath
me
hasn't
got
a
death
wish
bitch
won't
need
one
fade

to
27
int

crypt
night
27
spike
is
gathering
up
his
things
preparing
to
go
after
buffy
harmony
is
worried
about
him
okay
i'm
trying
to
be
supportive
here
so
don't
drive
a
stake
through
my
heart
like
last
time
but
you
can't
kill
buffy
she's
the
slayer
she
is
so
gonna
kick
your
ass
i've
got
two
barrels
here
that'll
prove
you
wrong
i
knew
you'd
take
this
personally
you
are
so
sensitive
how
are
you
going
to
kill
her
think
the
second
you
even
point
that
thing
at
her
you're
gonna
be
all
ahhh
she
holds
her
hand
to
her
head
in
mock
pain
and
then
you'll
get
bitchslapped
up
and
down
main
street
unless
she's
had
enough
and
just
stakes
you
sure
it'll
hurt
like
hell
for
about
two
hours
he
grabs
harmony
by
the
neck
and
twists
she
gasps
in
pain
but
she'll
be
dead
just
a
little
longer
than
that
he
tosses
harmony
aside
and
runs
out
fine
but
don't
come
crying
to
me
when
you
fail
you
couldn't
kill
her
before
you
got
the
chip
you
had
plenty
of
chances
cut
to
28
ext

drusilla

did
it
for
you

night

they
say
even
if
there
is
something

still
very
early
if
they

the
back
door

and
buffy
walks
out
and
sits
down
on
the
back
steps
she
is
terrified
for
her
mother
her
eyes
brimming
with
tears
she
puts
her
head
in
her
lap
and
sobs
uncontrollably
spike
watches
her
from
the
bushes
then
moves
forward
striding
purposefully
toward
her
gun
at
his
side
he
raises
the
gun
and
cocks
it
buffy
looks
up
at
the
sound
her
face
wet
with
tears
what
do
you
want
now
spike
is
about
to
pull
the
trigger
when
he
sees
her
tears
and
through
them
her
pain
his
rage
vanishes
in
an
instant
what's
wrong

don't
want
to
talk
about
it
spike
lowers
the
gun
is
there
something
i
can
do

says
nothing
the
reality
of
her
mother's
situation
hitting
her
like
a
steel
weight
overcoming
her
spike
sits
down
next
to
her
and
tentatively
pats
her
back
trying
to
comfort
her
she
lets
him
pull
back
on
the
two
of
them
sitting
together
side
by
side
fade
to
black
end
