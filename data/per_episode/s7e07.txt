do
you
mean
in
all
relationships
or
just
yours
my
parents
weren't
exactly
the
paragon
of
staytogethereyness
maybe
that's
part
of
it
i
think
there're
people
out
there
who'd
make
it
i
just
target
the
impossible
ones
with
deadly
accuracy
you
think
you
do
that
on
purpose
maybe
you're
trying
to
protect
yourself
protecting
myself
from
heartbreak
misery
sexual
violence
and
possible
death
not
so
much
from
committing
buffy
sits
up
i
commit

you're
reaching
out
they're
just
not
coming
through
buffy
shifts
her
body
it's
different
i
think
you're
confusing
me
because
you're
evil
i
just
think
you're
in
some
pain
herewhich
i
do
kind
of
enjoy
'cause
i'm
evil
nowbut
you
should
just
ease
up
on
yourself
it's
not
exactly
like
you
have
the
patent
on
bad
relationships
wouldn't
it
be
cool
if
i
did
and
what
are
yousupposed
to
be
settling
down
already
at

you
know
my
girlfriend
at
college
she's
so
sweet
we
have
this
great
thing
but
that
doesn't

to
you
in
high
school
and
now
we're
like
mortal
enemies
hey
wouldn't
it
be
cool
if
we
became
nemeses
is
that
how
you
say
the
word
we're
gonna
have
to
fight
to
the
death
aren't
we
it's
the
timehonored
custom
wow
reality
just
shows
up
sometimes
doesn't
it
but
you
know
i've
got
the
bloodlust
pumping
and
i
kinda
get
it
i'm
looking
for

you've
been
great
and

catching
up
i
haven't
really
kept
in

up
pretty
soon
holden

yeah
hey
i
don't
mean
to
be
count
buttinsky
here
but
you
just
don't
seem

because
we're
gonna
fight
's
'cause
i'm
gonna
win
holden

this
graveyard
buffy
shrugs
can't
let
ya
do
the
words
superiority
complex
mean
anything
to
you
you
think
i'm
gonna
let
you
go
kill
a
bunch
of
people
you
know
i'm
sworn
to
no
no
i
get
the
battle
against
evil
that's
not
the
issue
there
is
no
issue
don't
issue
me
just
answer
me
this
whose
fault
was
your
parents
divorce
buffy
rolls
eyes
ok
you
know
this
is
beyond
evil
this
is
insane
troll
logic
what
do
my
parents
have
to
do
with
holden
sits
on
sarcophagus
i'm
just
curious
your
opinion
buffy
sighs
sits
on

next
to
him
they
both
have
a
lot
of
off
the
top
of
your
head
buffy
hangs
head
my
dad
uhhuh
he
cheated
um
i
think
he
cheated
so
of
all
of
these
relationships
of
yoursthat
you
knew
subconsciously
were
totally
doomedwhose
fault
is
that
it's
incredibly
different
i
was
just
wondering
holden
stands
is
it
possible
even
a
little
bit
that
the
reason
you
have
trouble
connecting
to
guys
is
because
you
think
maybe
they're
not
worth
it
maybe
you
think
you're
better
than
them
buffy
glares
say
there's
that
bloodlust
i
was
looking
for
struck
a
nerve
i'm
gonna
strike
a
nerve
cluster
in
a
minute
you
don't
get
off
this
i
don't
remember
you
being
this
annoying
you
don't
remember
me
at
all
yes
i
do
yeah
like
after
30
minutes
of
reminding
and
i
don't
take
it
personally
because
clearly
you
were
in
your
own
little
world
in
high
school
all
chosen
all
destiny
who
could
live
with
that
for
seven
years
and
not
feel
superior
i'm
not
my
god
if
anything
i
buffy
hangs
head
