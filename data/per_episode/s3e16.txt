prologue

a
dark
chapel
dozens
of
candles
on
several
tall
iron
candle
holders
are
standing
around
the
chamber
an
altar
stands
at
one
end
upon
it
sits
the
high
demon
d'hoffryn
kneeling
before
him
on
a
small
rug
is
anya
she
who
was
anyanka
once
demon
but
now
doomed
to
be
mortal
pleading
her
case
d'hoffryn
resolutely
do
not
ask
again
anya
shocked
but
but
i
d'hoffryn
sternly
interrupts
your
powers
were
a
gift
of
the
lower
beings
you
have
proved
unworthy
of
them
i
was
robbed
of
them
by
your
carelessness
anya
dramatically
for
a
thousand
years
i
wielded
the
powers
of
the
wish
i
brought
ruin
to
the
heads
of
unfaithful
men
i
brought
forth
destruction
and
chaos
for
the
pleasure
of
the
lower
beings
i
was
feared
and
worshipped
across
the
mortal
globe
anya
disgustedly
and
now
i'm
stuck
at
sunnydale
high
anya
despondently
mortal
child
and
i'm
flunking
math
d'hoffryn
dismissively
this
is
no
concern
of
ours
you
will
live
out
your
mortal
life
and
die
anya
pleadingly
give
me
another
chance
you
can
fold
the
fabric
of
time
send
me
back
to
that
place
and
i'll
change
it
i
won't
fail
again
your
time
is
passed
anya
desperately
do
you
have
any
idea
how
boring
twelfth
graders
are
anya
stands
up
i'm
getting
my
power
center
back
anya
defiantly
and
if
you
won't
help
me
then
by
the
pestilent
gods
i
will
find
someone
who
will
cut
to
sunnydale
high
willow
is
lying
on
a
grassy
area
concentrating
hard
soon
a
pencil
floats
up
into
view
and
starts
to
slowly
turn
end
over
end
willow
smiles
at
her
successful
levitation
beside
her
buffy
does
situps
the
watcher
council
shrink
is
heavy
into
tests
he's
got
tests
for
everything
tats
rorschach
associative
logic
buffy
grunts
and
sits
up
he
even
has
that
test
to
see
if
you're
crazy
that
asks
if
you
ever
hear
voices
or
you
ever
wanted
to
be
a
florist
willow
looks
over
at
buffy
ooo
i
used
to
want
willow
reconsiders
wait
florist
means
crazy
right
willow
turns
back
to
her
pencil
i
never
wanted
to
do
that
buffy
does
some
stretching
exercises
while
she
watches
the
pencil
as
well
buffy
smiles
impressed
neat
willow
grins
thanks
it's
all
about
emotional
control
plus
obviously
magic
willow
looks
at
buffy
giddily
hey
you
wanna
go
to
the
espresso
pump
and
get
sugared
up
on
mochas
i'm
gonna
pass
hit
the
pool
and
do
some
laps
willow
bewildered
how
come
the
sudden
calisthenics
aren't
you
sort
of
naturally
buff
buff
willow
smiles
and
giggles
buff
buff
well
they've
got
us
running
around
on
the
physical
side
too
a
lot
of
reflex
evaluation
and
precision
training
you
know
ii
just
well
ii
wanna
do
willow
smiles
knowingly
better
than
faith
buffy
embarrassed
so
very
shallow
willow
sits
up
competition
is
natural
and
healthy
plus
you'll
definitely
ace
her
on
the
psych
tests
just
don't
mark
the
box
that
says
'i
sometimes
like
to
kill
people'
buffy
willow
ruefully
i
know
faith's
not
gonna
be
on
the
cover
of
sanity
fair
but
she
had
it
rough
different
circumstances
that
could
be
me
willow
shakes
her
head
no
way
some
people
just
don't
have
that
in
them
buffy
apologetically
look
i'm
sorry
ii
know
how
you
hate
talking
about
faith
no
it's
okay
no
really
we
should
just
buffy
glances
at
the
pencil
no
iit
doesn't
bother
me
i
mean
it
buffy
notices
the
pencil
uh
will
willow
looks
at
it
oh
the
pencil
is
spinning
wildly
an
instant
later
it
darts
off
and
buries
itself
deeply
into
a
tree
willow
gives
buffy
a
concerned
look
emotional
control
willow
abashed
i'm
working
on
it
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part

sunnydale
high
school
cut
to
principal
snyder's
office
he
stands
at
the
door
hands
in
pockets
looking
with
great
satisfaction
at
willow
and
percy
west
who
are
seated
facing
his
desk
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
this
is
a
marriage
made
in
heaven
snyder
takes
off
his
jacket
willow
rosenberg
despite
her
unsavory
associations
snyder
hangs
it
on
the
coat
rack
represents
the
pinnacle
of
academic
achievement
at
sunnydale
high
snyder
strolls
up
to
them
percy
west
represents
a
devastating
fast
break
snyder
puts
his
hand
on
percy's
shoulder
and
50
from
behind
the
threepoint
line
goes
around
his
desk
to
his
chair
willow
confused
ii'm
not
sure

understand
the
marriage
part
willow
glances
at
percy

fast
break

perfect
match

snyder
sits
percy
is
flunking
history
nothing
seems
to
be
able
to
motivate
him
percy
flippantly
hey
i'm
challenged
snyder
raises
his
eyebrows
you're
lazy
selfinvolved
and
spoiled
that's
quite
the
challenge
but
we
need
a
winning
year
especially
after
last
year's
debacle
with
the
swim
team
can't
have
our
point
guard
benched
snyder
to

a
little
teaching
job

feeble
excuses

all
in
his
eyes

study
table
willow
sets

panting
heavily

quite
well
on
the
obstacle
field
wesley

still
a
little
sloppy
though

sternly
faith
this
evaluation
is
a
necessary
part
of
the
council's
faith
apologetically
i
know
i'm
on
board
here
just
shooting
my
mouth
off
i
better
change
she
starts
to
walk
out
as
she
passes
by
faith
leans
toward
her
good
luck
she
reaches
out
lightly
brushes
buffy's
shoulder
with
her
hand
and
gives
her
a
little
smile
buffy
returns
the
smile
weakly
and
continues
out
wesley
takes
a
deep
breath
and
follows
her
faith
notices
willow
at
the
computer
and
hops
up
on
the
counter
to
sit
and
watch
what
cha
doin'
willow
trying
to
concentrate
i'm
trying
to
access
the
mayor's
personal
files
faith
surprised
can
you
do
that
well
he's
got
some
tricky
barriers
set
up
faith
warily
can
you
get
past
'em
willow
stubbornly
eventually
i'll
get
through
faith
watches
intently
as
willow
continues
her
hacking
cut
to
a
spacious
new
studio
apartment
mayor
wilkins
considers
faith's
report
mayor
wilkins
musingly
that's
very
interesting
yeah
i
thought
so
too
faith
looks
around
are
you
serious
about
this
place
faith
continues
exploring
of
course
i
am
no
slayer
of
mine
is
gonna
live
in
a
fleabag
hotel
that
place
has
a
very
unsavory
reputation
there
are
immoral
liaisons
going
on
there
faith
checks
out
the
kitchen
yeah
plus
all
the
screwing
this
place
is
the
kick
she
walks
past
a
leather
punching
bag
hanging
in
a
corner
and
continues
into
the
sleeping
area
we'll
keep
your
old
place
in
case
you
need
to
see
your
friends
there
but
from
now
on
faith
jumps
up
on
the
bed
and
bounces
mayor
wilkins
appalled
oh
hey
hey
hey
shoes
shoes
faith
hops
off
of
the
bed
and
goes
up
to
the
mayor
faith
smiling
sultrily
thanks
sugar
daddy
mayor
wilkins
admonishingly
now
faith
i
don't
find
that
sort
of
thing
amusing
i'm
a
family
man
he
steps
aside
to
let
faith
continue
looking
around
mayor
wilkins
briskly
now
let's
kill
your
little
friend
faith
gives
him
an
uneasy
look
mayor
wilkins
reassuringly
don't
worry
i
wouldn't
ask
you
to
do
it
not
this
early
in
the
relationship
faith
sits
doubtfully
considers
besides
i
think
a
vampire
attack
would
be
less
suspicious
anyway
in
the
meantime
let's
take
a
look
at
the
rest
of
the
apartment
huh
faith
stands
up
again
if
i'm
not
mistaken
some
lucky
girl
has
herself
a
playstation
faith
grins
broadly
no
way
mayor
wilkins
grins
back
proudly
yes
way
mayor
wilkins
chuckles
happily
faith
heads
over
to
the
tv
to
check
it
out
cut
to
the
halls
at
sunnydale
high
oz
finds
willow
as
she
walks
along
hey

at

other
and
move
closer
to
hug

something
about
you
that's
causing
me
to
hug
you
oz
teasingly
it's
like
i
have
no
will
of
my
own
they
move
apart
willow
has
a
huge
smile
on
her
face
where

yesterday
they
start
walking
holding
hands
mm
we
got
back
late

of
very
willow
perplexed
we
who
where

night
they
stop
by
a
classroom
willow
distressed
oh

would
have
liked

go
didn't
figure
you
for
missing
school
willow
disappointed
you
think
i'm
boring
i'd
call
that
a
radical
interpretation
of
the
text
we're
playing
tonight
at
the
bronze
willow
apologetically
i
can't
i
have
too
much
homework
oz
invitingly
if
you
get
done
early
he
steps
toward
the
classroom
their
hands
don't
part
until
necessary
cut
to
the
quad
percy
comes
up
the
stairs
from
the
underpass
below
the
administrative
offices
willow
catches
up
with
him
he
just
continues
walking
completely
disinterested
percy
hey
listen
i
thought
we
could
get
together
today
at
lunch
and
go
over
your
roosevelt
paper
you
know
what
books
you'll
need
and
stuff
percy
purposely
obtuse
what
are
you
talking
about
me
tutoring
you
your
your
history
paper
oh
yeah
yeah
snyder
said
you
were
gonna
do
it
willow
surprised
he
never
said
that
percy
gives
her
an
obnoxious
look
what
meeting
were
you
at
look
ii'll
get
the
books

need
just
meet
me
at
lunch
and
percy
interrupts
no

gotta
hang
out

percy
stops
and
faces
her
impatiently
what

you
got
something
better
to
do
just
type
it
up
and
put
my
name
on
it
oh
and
don't
type
too
good
dead
giveaway
percy
leaves
willow
can't
believe
his
attitude
and
sinks
down
on
one
of
the
benches
dejectedly
she
takes
off
her
pack
reaches
in
and
pulls
out
a
banana
willow
with
resolve
i'm
eating
this
now
willow
daringly
it's
not
lunchtime
i
don't
even
care
before
she
can
begin
peeling
it
buffy
and
xander
walk
up
to
her
hey
willow
did
you
remember
to
tape
biography
last
friday
willow
absently
uhhuh
willow
struggles
with
the
banana
buffy
to
xander
proudly
see
i
told
you
old
reliable
xander
nods
and
smiles
willow
is
not
amused
willow
sourly
oh
thanks
buffy
taken
aback
what
'old
reliable'
yeah
great
willow
reprovingly
there's
a
sexy
nickname
well
ii
didn't
mean
it
as
no
it's
fine
i'm
'old
reliable'
she
just
means
you
know
the
geyser
you're
like
a
geyser
of
fun
that
goes
off
at
regular
intervals
willow
disgustedly
that's
old
faithful
isn't
that
the
dog
that
that
the
guy
had
to
shoot
willow
incensed
that's
old
yeller
xander
i
beg
you
not
to
help
me
will
ii
didn't
mean
it
as
a
bad
thing
ii
think
it's
good
to
be
reliable
willow
stands
up
annoyed
well
maybe
i
don't
wanna
be
reliable
all
the
time
maybe
i'm
not
just
some
doormat
person
homework
gal
i'm
thinking
nerve
strike
willow
huffs
at
him
and
starts
to
go
but
turns
back
maybe
i'll
change
my
look
or
cut
class
you
don't
know
buffy
and
xander
just
give
her
surprised
looks
willow
holds
up
her
banana
defiantly
and
i'm
eating
this
banana
lunchtime
be
damned
strides
off
buffy
goes
after
her
will
wait
i'm
really
sorry
willow
interrupts
chiding
gently
buff
i'm
storming
off
it
doesn't
really
work
if
you
come
with
me
buffy
chastened
oh
willow
goes
on
her
way
buffy
looks
back
sadly
at
xander
cut
to
the
halls
willow
starts
trudging
up
the
stairs
anya
notices
her
uh
willow
willow
turns
around
uh
hi
willow
doesn't
recognize
anya
gestures
at
herself
anya
anya
smiles
i'm
sort
of
new
here
anya
hopefully
um
i
know
cordelia
willow
smiles
thinly
oh
fun
yeah
um
listen
anya
steps
up
closer
to
her
i
have
this
little
project
i'm
working
on
and
i
heard
you
were
the
person
to
ask
if
willow
interrupts
ironically
yeah
that's
me
reliabledoggeyser
person
what
do
you
need
oh
it's
nothing
big
anya
secretively
just
a
little
spell
i'm
working
on
anya
shrugs
willow
suddenly
interested
steps
down
to
her
a
spell
willow
nonchalantly
oh
i
like
the
black
arts
i
just
need
a
secondary
to
create
a
temporal
fold
i
heard
you
were
a
pretty
powerful
wicca
so
anya
shrugs
again
willow
smiles
excitedly
you
heard
right
mister
iii'm
always
ready
to
work
some
dark
mojo
willow
hopefully
so
tell
me
is
it
dangerous
anya
dismissively
oh
no
anya
shakes
her
head
willow
disappointed
well
could
we
pretend
it
is
cut
to
an
empty
classroom
after
school
the
camera
pulls
back
from
a
large
white
plate
with
a
representation
of
anya's
lost
necklace
painted
on
it
willow
kneels
facing
it
arranging
herbs
bones
and
candles
anya
sits
at
a
desk
and
prepares
a
mixture
of
sands
and
powders
the
necklace
was
a
family
heirloom
passed
down
for
generations
then
it
was
stolen
from
my
mom's
apartment
how
does
the
spell
work
anya
gets
up
uh
well
we
both
call
on
eryishon
anya
kneels
opposite
willow
the
endless
one
offer
up
the
standard
supplication
then
there's
a
teensy
temporal
fold
anya
smiles
weakly
we
hope
um
then
i
pour
the
sacred
sand
on
the
representation
of
the
necklace
and
eryishon
brings
it

there
is
a
low
rumbling
and
a
pillar
of
energy
appears
over
the
plate
and
around
the
girls'
hands
their
hands
begin
to
shake
and
willow
whips
open
her
eyes
surprised
by
how
powerful
this
spell
actually
is
she
sees
scenes
from
an
alternate
universe
anyanka
choking
giles
licking
her
fingers
herself
and
xander
as
vampires
anyanka's
necklace
buffy
staking

broken
wood
of

smashed
her
vampire
self
attacking

and
getting

the

falling
to
the
floor
being
grabbed
by

sitting
alone
in
an
empty
factory
without

oz
coming
for

grabbing

in

anya
turns
over
the
bottle
of
sand
and
it
pours
out
some
of
it
sifts
through
willow's
fingers
before
hitting
the
plate
more
visions
follow
angel
letting
the
imprisoned
humans
out
herself
fighting
one
oz
still
coming
for

reaching
out
to
grab
her
suddenly
she
disappears
from
the
scene
willow
flashes
back
to
the
classroom
where
she
has
a
wideeyed
look
of
surprise
and
shock
on
her
face
the
pillar
of
energy
fades
and
she
pulls
back
her
hands
breathing
hard
that
was
wwwhat

that
willow
slowly
stands
up
anya
feels
for
her
necklace
in

anguished
nothing

cut
to
the
factory

empty
except
for
a
lot
of
small
debris
evil
willow
jerks
up
from
the
floor
and
looks
around
shocked
to
suddenly
find
that
the
master
his
machine
the
humans
the
vampires
everything
is
gone
this
is
weird
part

cut
to
the
street
in
front
of
the
sun
cinema
hotel
and
the
goose
ran
are
the
featured
films
the
camera
pans
down
from
the
sign
to
several
children
running
along
the
sidewalk
and
comes
up
on
evil
willow
she's
standing
in
the
street
disoriented
and
confused
by
everything
she
sees
around
her
there
are
so
many
people
and
children
boldly
walking
and
running
around
at
night
without
a
care
in
the
world
to
her
it's
all
strange
very
strange
these
people
should
be
cowering
in
their
homes
not
out
enjoying
themselves
as
she
walks
along
the
yellow
centerline
some
people
walk
by
her
crossing
the
street
from
the
theater
to
the
espresso
pump
coming
within
reaching
distance
blissfully
unaware
of
who
she
is
no
one
fears
her
no
one
even
notices
her
behind
her
she
hears
a
girl
screaming
and
turns
to
look
but
the
girl
is
just
resisting
some
teasing
from
her
boyfriend
not
shaking
in
fear
of
a
vampire
an
old
woman
approaches
her
not
even
put
off
by
her
full
leather
attire
eeexcuse
me
young
lady
evil
willow
faces
her
and
snarls
the
lady
is
frightened
and
she
backs
away
shaken
but
she's
not
terrified
as
evil
willow
would
have
expected
probably
assuming
she
was
just
another
punk
she
rolls
her
eyes
and
continues
cut
to
the
bronze
k's
choice
is
on
stage
performing
virgin
state
of
mind
a
slow
bluesy
number
while
several
couples
slow
dance
to
it
there's
a
chair
in
my
head
on
which
i
used
to
sit
took
a
pencil
and
i
wrote
the
following
on
it
now
there's
a
key
where
my
wonderful
mouth
used
to
be
evil
willow
enters
and
looks
around
the
place
is
calm
especially
compared
to
what
she's
used
to
people
are
hanging
out
chatting
drinking
playing
pool
only
a
few
eyes
notice
her
in
her
black
leather
dig

at
me
dig

willow
stops
by
a
pool
table
and
looks
forlornly
all
around
taking
in
the
situation
where
can
i
run
to
where
can
i
hide
who
will
i
turn
to
now
i'm
in
the
virgin
state
of

a
guy
in
a
leather
jacket
can't
help
but
notice
evil
willow
as
she
walks
around
him
staring
appraisingly
at
him
with
her
evil
scowl
she
just
keeps
going
he
doesn't
want
anything
to
do
with
her
got
a
knife
to
disengage
the
voids
that
i
can't
bear
cut
out
words
i've
got
written
on
my
chair
like
do
you
think
i'm
sexy
and

begins
to
get
depressed
about
how

raises
her
eyes
and
looks
at
him
with
weary
amusement
bored
now
she
shoves
the
heel
of
her
hand
squarely
into
his
chest
sending
him
flying
onto
a
pool
table
he
lands
hard
on
his
back
and
his
momentum
forces
him
into
a
back
roll
off

around

are
shocked

tries
to

she
idly
blocks
him
and
looks
up
into
his
eyes
sadly
at
first
but
then
with
a
wide
grin
when
percy
can't
pull
her
hand
off

nods
obediently
at
his
new
boss
cut
to
the
library
buffy
and
xander
come
in
both
silent
very
detached
from
reality
giles
hears
them
come
in
and
walks
out
from
his
office
oh
buffy
i
thought
you
were
going
out

the
oppressive
grief
in
their
expressions

very
worried
what
is
it
cut
to
later
after
they've
explained
they
all
sit
on
the
stairs
to
the
stacks
detached
and
staring
off
into
space
giles
dangles
his
glasses
from
his
hands
xander
idly
handles
a
cross
xander
takes
a
breath
this
isn't

numbly
i
can't
feel
anything
arms
legs
anything
she
was
truly
the
finest
of
all
of
us
way
better
than
me
giles
nods
decisively
much

better
it's
all
my
fault
buffy
despairingly
no
it's
me
iit's
me
i'm
the
one
that
called
her
reliable
she
must
have
gone
out
and
gotten
attacked
which
she
never
would
have
done
if

hadn't
have
called
her
reliable
and
now

in
and
finds

curiously
what's
going

all
look
up
surprised
xander
lifts
his
cross
in
defense
willow
notices
their
sad
faces
and
is
amazed
at
their
expressions
jeez

notices
just
how
deeply
sad
they
really
are
and
realizes
she
may
have
gotten
it
right

jumps
up
and
gets
in
willow's
face
with
the
cross
back
get
back
demon
she
doesn't
cower
from
it
but
instead
shows
deep
concern
for
him
thinking
maybe
he's
flipped
out
or
something
xander
shakes
the
cross
as
though
it
were
broken
and
puts
it
back
in
her
face
buffy
and
giles

that
she's
not
frightened
of
the
cross
and
slowly

without
any
further
hesitation

two
steps
to
her
best
friend
and
hugs
her
hard
and
close
oh
willow
is
surprised
and
lets
out
a
little
groan
from
the
tightness
of
the
embrace

hugging
her
for
all
he's

issue
they
both
let
go
smiling
at
her
with
tears
in
their
eyes
she
smiles
back
but
still
doesn't
know
what
to
make
of
it
all
giles
what's
going
on
with
these
before
she
can
finish
she
finds
herself
being
warmly
embraced
again
by
the
normally
reserved
watcher
oh

she
groans
from
the
tightness
of
the
hug
and

a
bit
embarrassed
at

closely
by

when

alone
at

willow
sweetly
what's
your

sandy
evil
willow
lightly
brushes
her
hands
along
sandy's
arm
and
takes
her
hand

slowly
pulls
her
onto
the
dance
floor
where
everyone
can
see

disarmingly
just
to

to

make
you

and

around
to

and
stands
behind

continuing
to
fondle
sandy's
shoulders
and
head
evil
willow
enticingly
we'll
have
fun
sandy
flinches
when
evil
willow
grasps
her
hair
and
pulls
it
to
the
side
forcing
sandy
to
tilt
her
head
leaving
her
neck
bare
evil
willow
lasciviously
licks
the
girl's
neck
if
you're
not
she
looks
around
warningly
vamps
out
smiles
licks
her
lips
and
roars
as
she
bites
sandy
savagely
on
the
neck
and
drains
her
dry
oz
tries
to
run
from
the
stage
to
sandy's
aid
but
is
stopped
by
one
of
the
vampires
devon
to
oz
no
man
when
evil
willow
is
finished
feeding
she
lets
sandy's
lifeless
body
collapse
to
the
floor
and
morphs
back
to
her
human
guise
evil
willow
idly
curious
questions
comments
oz
shocked
willow
you
don't
wanna
do
this
evil
willow
approaches
blithely
i
don't
evil
willow
smiles
proudly
but
i'm
so
good
at
it
the
vampire
holding
oz
lets
him
go
down
to
meet
her
oz
horrified
who
did
this
to
you
evil
willow
recognizes
him
i
know
you
evil
willow
disgustedly
you're
a
white
hat
evil
willow
eyes
narrow
puzzled
how
come
you're
talking
to
me
like
we're
friends
anya
slowly
comes
up
to
her
from
behind
anya
unafraid
'cause
he
thinks
you're
someone
else
he
thinks
you're
the
willow
that
belongs
in
this
reality
evil
willow
confused
another
me
you
know
this
isn't
your
world
right
i
mean
you
know
you
don't
belong
here
evil
willow
softly
no
this
is
a
dumb
world
evil
willow
smiles
wistfully
in
my
world
there
are
people
in
chains
and
we
can
ride
them
like
ponies
anya
states
the
obvious
you
wanna
get
back
there
evil
willow
nods
mournfully
yeah
so
do
i
cut
to
the
school
cut
to
the
library
giles
sits
deep
in
thought
willow
leans
in
giles'
office
doorway
while
buffy
and
xander
sit
on
the
study
table
this
is
creepy
i
don't
like
the
thought
that
there's
a
vampire
out
there
that
looks
like
me
not
looks
like
is
it
was
exactly
you
will
every
detail
except
for
your
not
being
a
dominatrix
buffy
uneasily
as
far
as
we
know
willow
rolls
her
eyes
grins
sardonically
oh
right
me
and
oz
play
'mistress
of
pain'
every
night
giles
furrows
his
brow
buffy
and
xander's
eyes
glaze
over
did
anyone
else
just
go
to
a
scary
visual
place
oh
yeah
they
all
look
up
when
angel
makes
a
quick
and
noisy
entrance
breathing
hard
from
running
angel
very
upset
buffy
i
i
just
something's
happened
that
he
pauses
when
he
gets
patient
waiting
looks
from
buffy
and
xander
angel
blurts
it
out
willow's
dead
buffy
and
xander
nod
knowingly
willow
straightens
up
from
leaning
against
the
door
frame
angel
notices
her
angel
distractedly
hey
willow
he
looks
back
at
buffy
and
xander
xander
raises
his
eyebrows
at
him
suddenly
it
clicks
in
angel's
mind
and
he
does
a
double
take
at
willow
angel
very
confused
wait
a
second
he
looks
back
at
buffy
and
xander
for
confirmation
giles
raises
his
eyebrows
rolls
his
eyes
and
grimaces
xander
understandingly
we're
right
there
with
you
buddy
we
saw
her
too
at
the
bronze
willow
smiles
reassuringly
at
him
and
blithely
waves
angel
still
somewhat
unsure
okay
she's
there
now
with
a
cadre
of
vampires
looking
to
party
they
all
immediately
get
up
and
head
out
buffy
resignedly
we
can
figure
out
who
she
is
after
we
stop
the
feeding
frenzy
cut
to
the
hall
how
many
of
them
were
there
eight
or
ten
buffy
to
giles
should
we
call
faith
no
i
don't
want
her
in
combat
yet
not
around
civilians
xander
heartily
hear
hear
willow
holds
back
guys
willow
they
stop
and
look
back
what
are
we
gonna
do
with
me
the
other
me
the
three
men
look
at
each
other
uncomfortably
shuffling
their
feet
and
hanging
back
buffy
realizes
she
has
to
take
the
lead
buffy
comes
closer
to
willow
i
don't
know
will
buffy
hesitates
i
mean
we
just
have
to
stop
them
ii
get
that
i
just
kind
of
wanted
to
know
willow
thinks
of
something
oh
hey
uh
go
ii'll
catch
up
she
heads
back
into
the
library
as
the
others
go
cut
inside
the
library
willow
goes
to
the
checkout
counter
and
leans
over
but
can't
reach
what
she's
looking
for
she
starts
to
go
around
it
but
an
arm
reaches
around
from
behind
and
grabs
her
a
hand
clamps
over
her
mouth
to
prevent
her
from
screaming
evil
willow
gloating
alone
at
last
part

the
library
evil
willow
turns
willow
around
and
looks
her
up
and
down
particularly
noticing
her
pink
sweater
evil
willow
appraisingly
well
look
at
me
evil
willow
doubtfully
i'm
all
fuzzy
what
do
i
want
with
you
willow
catches
herself
uh
evil
willow
grimly
your
little
school
friend
anya
said
that
you're
the
one
that
brought
me
here
she
said
that
you
could
get
me
back
to
my
world
oh
willow
gets
it
oh
oops
but
i
don't
know
evil
willow
smiles
wickedly
i
kinda
like
the
idea
of
the
two
of
us
she
turns
willow
around
again
caressing
her
shoulders
we
could
be
quite
a
team
evil
willow
meaningfully
if
you
came
around
to
my
way
of
thinking
willow
uncertainly
would
that
mean
we
have
to
snuggle
evil
willow
brushes
willow's
hair
away
from
her
neck
evil
willow
coaxing
what
do
you
say
she
gives
willow's
neck
an
eager
lengthy
lick
willow
shudders
with
loathing
and
grimaces
at
the
feeling
evil
willow
enticingly
wanna
be
bad
willow
completely
unnerved
this
just
can't
get
more
disturbing
evil
willow
growls
horribly
with
desire
and
bares
her
teeth
behind
willow's
neck
willow
freaks
out
and
whirls
around
stepping
back
and
away
from
her
willow
flapping
her
hands
with
disgust
ack
ew
no
more
you're
really
starting
to
freak
me
out
she
tries
to
go
around
evil
willow
but
gets
blocked
she
snatches
up
xander's
cross
from
the
counter
and
nervously
waves
it
in
evil
willow's
face
who
roars
and
bats
her
arm
away
sending
the
cross
flying
she
grabs
willow
and
throws
her
hard
up
and
over
the
counter
willow
lands
with
a
crash
hitting
her
head
hard
against
the
metal
filing
cabinet
ow
evil
willow
stalks
grimly
around
the
counter
you
don't
wanna
play
i
guess
i
can't
force
you
willow
reaches
under
the
counter
for
what
she
originally
came
for
and
pulls
out
the
dart
rifle
just
as
evil
willow
comes
through
the
door
to
behind
the
counter
oh
wait
willow
locks
the
bolt
in
place
evil
willow
smiling
meanly
i
can
willow
frantically
aims
and
fires
the
dart
hits
evil
willow
dead
center
of
her
chest
stunned
she
looks
down
at
the
protruding
dart
staggers
and
starts
to
fall
evil
willow
moans
bitch
she
hits
the
floor
willow
stares
in
fearful
amazement
at
her
other
fallen
self
cut
to
later
angel
and
xander
drag
evil
willow
by
the
arms
into
the
book
cage
giles
dumbfounded
it's
extraordinary
willow
appalled
it's
horrible
that's
me
as
a
vampire
willow
angel
closes
the
door
i'm
so
evil
and
skanky
willow
aside
to
buffy
worried
and
i
think
i'm
kinda
gay
buffy
reassuringly
willow
just
remember
a
vampire's
personality
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
person
it
was
angel
without
thinking
well
actually
angel
gets
a
look
from
buffy
that's
a
good
point
so
uh
what
do
we
do
now
we
still
have
to
get
to
the
bronze
well
even
if
they're
supposed
to
wait
for
her
they
may
start
feeding
vampires
are
not
notoriously
reliable
xander
hopefully
so
we
charge
in
much
in
the
style
of
john
wayne
high
casualty
risk
i
haven't
any
other
plan
though
buffy
raises
her
hand
uh
i
have
a
really
bad
idea
cut
to
the
bronze
the
camera
pans
from
the
sign
down
to
the
group
angel
drops
down
from
the
roof
onto
a
crate
then
down
to
the
pavement
they're
still
in
a
holding
pattern
that's
good
it
means
they
must
really
be
afraid
of
you
willow
walks
up
to
them
wearing
evil
willow's
leather
ensemble
who
wouldn't
be
she
shifts
around
uncomfortably
trying
to
get
the
feel
of
the
tight
outfit
are
you
okay
in
that
it's
a
little
binding
i
guess
vampires
really
don't
have
to
breathe
willow
notices
her
cleavage
gosh
look
at
those
xander
stares
with
wide
eyes
giles
stammers
um
ahem
willow
you
uh
you
go
in
and
defuse
the
situation
as
best
you
can
at
least
try
and
get
some
of
them
to
come
out
and
even
up
the
odds
a
bit
first
sign
of
trouble
you
give
us
a
signal
we
come
in
hard
and
fast
what
is
the
signal
willow
worried
me
screaming
giles
you
and
xander
wait
by
the
back
entrance
good
they
go
buffy
shows
concern
for
her
friend
now
you're
sure
you're
up
to
this
don't
worry
i
won't
do
anything
that
could
be
interpreted
as
brave
willow
smiles
we'll
be
right
outside
willow
nods
wanly
and
heads
for
the
door
still
twisting
uncomfortably
in
the
leather
she
takes
a
deep
breath
and
knocks
with
firm
resolve
cut
inside
a
vampire
opens
the
door
willow
smiles
and
waves
at
him
in
greeting
hi
i'm
back
she
slowly
comes
in
alfonse
and
anya
meet
her
inside
willow
does
her
best
not
to
show
her
fear
did
you
find
the
girl
willow
tries
to
sound
authoritative
yep
i
did
anya
mystified
where
is
she
willow
bravely
i
killed
her
anya
gives
her
a
look
of
stunned
disbelief
and
sucked
her
blood
willow
nods
triumphantly
as
we
vampires
do
the
silence
is
thick
with
tension
making
her
nervous
she
turns
to
the
doorman
willow
quietly
aside
to
him
you
know
i
think
maybe
i
heard
something
out
there
why
don't
you
go
check
he
opens
the
door
and
goes
out
closing
the
door
behind
him
outside
angel
grabs
him
by
the
shoulders
and
holds
him
steady
as
buffy
plunges
a
stake
into
his
chest
back
inside
anya
confronts
willow
anya
incredulous
hhow
could
you
kill
her
she
was
our
best
shot
at
getting
your
world
back
willow
walks
past
her
straightens
challengingly
i
don't
like
that
you
dare
question
me
oz
notices
that
something's
up
willow
now
enjoying
herself
maybe
i'll
have
my
minions
take
you
out
back
and
kill
you
horribly
she
sneaks
oz
a
little
smile
and
wave
he
barely
reacts
just
raising
an
eyebrow
a
bit
anya
follows
her
onto
the
dance
floor
anya
muttering
vampires
always
thinking
with
your
teeth
willow
haughtily
she
bothered
me
she's
so
weak
and
accommodating
she's
always
letting
people
walk
all
over
her
willow
turns
to
face
her
and
then
she
gets
cranky
with
her
friends
for
no
reason
i
just
couldn't
let
her
live
she
steps
over
to
another
vampire
indicating
the
door
willow
chummily
you
know
he's
been
gone
for
a
while
why
don't
you
go
check
on
him
willow
pats
his
shoulder
approvingly
he
heads
for
the
door
and
goes
out
alfonse
impatiently
well
boss
since
that
plan
is
out
why
don't
we
get
with
the
killing
willow
suddenly
worries
that
her
plan
may
have
backfired
cut
to
the
library
evil
willow
regains
consciousness
in
the
book
cage
now
dressed
in
willow's
pink
sweater
and
flowery
skirt
she
sits
up
and
notices
her
change
of
clothes
evil
willow
recoiling
oh
this
is
like
a
nightmare
the
door
opens
and
cordelia
comes
into
the
library
she's
dressed
in
a
shimmery
evening
dress
carrying
a
couple
of

she
heads
behind
the
counter
evil
willow

up
cordelia
puts
in

of
unlocking

she
looks
up
at
evil
willow
and
has
a
thought

cordelia
briskly
it
occurs
to
me
that

locked
up
evil

the
ethics
of
boyfriend
stealing
evil
willow
can't
believe
it
cut
to
the
bronze
i
don't
know
if
i
feel
like
killing

anya
and
alfonse
can't
believe
their
ears
willow
walks
past
a
girl
at
a
table
i'm
so
bored
she
idly
rakes
her
fingers
through
the
girl's
long
hair
but
they
get
tangled
rather
than
pull
them
through
harder
to
keep
in
character
she
gently
lays
the
girl's
hair
back
anya
begins
to
get
suspicious
willow
strolls
over
to
the
stage
putting
oz
to
her
back
iit
would
be
like
shooting
fish
in
a
barrel
where's
the
fun
alfonse
smiles
grimly
with
all
due
respect
boss
the
fun
would
be
the
eating
willow
brilliantly
maybe
we
should
let
everyone
go
and
give
them
a
thirty
second
head
start
anya
finally
figures
it
out
wait
a
minute
willow
frowns
fretfully

my
plan

try
willow
desperately
okay
let's
get
to
the
killing
willow
hurriedly
to
alfonse
why
don't
we
start
with
her
why
don't
we
start
with
you
anya
to
alfonse
in
disgust

a
vampire

the
creature
from

willow
hangs
onto

extremely
bored
cordelia
has
made
herself
comfortable
seated
in
a
chair
facing
the
cage
and
holding
a
mug
of
coffee
cordelia
rationalizing
and
okay
it
isn't
even
like
i
was
that
attracted
to
xander
it
was
more
just
that
we
kept
being
put
in
these
life
or
death
situations
and
that's
always
all
sexy
and
stuff
evil
willow
just
stares
blankly
out
of
the
cage
cordelia
gets
up
i
mean
i
more
or
less
knew
he
was
a
loser
cordelia
sets
down
the
mug
cordelia
huffily
but
that
doesn't
make
it
okay
for
you
to
come
around
and
cordelia
notices
evil
willow's
stare

humanitarian
cordelia

shoots
out
screaming
wildly
and
runs
down
the
hall
cut
to
a
dark
empty
classroom
cordelia
runs
in
and
backs
up
along
two
rows
of
desks
pulling
them
together
as
she
goes
to
block
evil
willow's
way
cordelia
desperately

cordelia
runs
away
screaming
through
the
classroom's
back
door
cut
to
the
hall
in
front
of
the
library
wesley
is
walking
toward
the
doors
when
another
scream
from
cordelia
catches
him
by
surprise
he
reacts
defensively
dropping
his
briefcase
and
spinning
round
but
quickly
recovers
himself
and
starts
running
in
the
direction
of
the
scream
abandoning
his
briefcase
reaching
under
his
jacket
for
a
cross
cut
to
the
girls'
bathroom
cordelia
runs
in
and
realizes
she's
made
a
mistake
trapping
herself
evil
willow
strolls
in
behind
her
no
more
hiding
cordelia
backs
away
as
she
advances
suddenly
wesley
jumps
out
and
brandishes
his
cross
in

quickly
but
nervously
reaches
into
his
jacket
and
pulls
out
a
vial
of
holy
water
evil
willow
sighs
he
holds
it
up
threatening
to
throw
it
on
her
evil
willow
sighs
heavily
whatever
she
turns
and
leaves
wesley
slowly
relaxes
heaving
a
sigh
of
relief
and
lowering
the
cross
and
the
vial
cordelia
walks
up
behind
him
and
lightly
touches
him
on
the
shoulder
he
freaks
out
screams
and
spins
around
thrusting
the
cross
and
holy
water
right
into
cordelia's
face
he
lowers
them
when
he
recognizes
her
and
tries
to
catch
his
breath
cordelia
whines
apologetically
i'm
sorry

the
water
away

deeply

on

runs
over
to
engage

cue
to

a
high
punch
from
alfonse
and
then
hits
him
in

she
spins

instead
of

head
angel

then
follows
up
with
a
full
spinning

him
things
are
looking
dire
for

buffy
runs
to
her
aid
smashing
the
cue
into
the
back
of
a
vampire's
head
along
the
way
and
breaking
it
resulting
in
a
sharp
makeshift
stake

leaps
up
onto
the
stage
and
is
about
to
stab
down
hard
with
it
into
evil
willow's
back
with
it
when
willow
shouts
out
to
stop
her
willow
urgently
buffy
no
buffy
reacts
instantly
holding

just
short
of
penetration
and
instead
grabs
evil
willow
and
yanks
her
roughly
away
from
willow
restraining
her
securely
angel
is
finished
with
his
fight
also
and
hops
up
onto

outnumbered
willow
stands
up
and
gingerly
massages
her
neck

nothing

but
still
buffy
understandingly
there
but
for
the
grace
of
getting

willow
resolutely
we
send

the
way

their
heads
at

delusions
of
grandeur

willow
helpfully
try
not

kill
people
evil
willow
doesn't
display
any
emotion
but
willow
smiles
warmly
at
her
and
gives
her
a
big
hug
evil
willow
isn't
sure
what
to
make
of
that
but
gets
into
the
spirit
and
does
some
naughty
touching

evil
willow
gives
her
a
naughty
knowing
smile
the
two
of

kneel
down
as

and
then
returns
to
the
ongoing
fight
in
the
alternate
universe
evil
willow
materializes
and
smiles
relieved
to
be
back
in
her
own
reality
only
to
be
suddenly
grabbed
by
oz
and
shoved
back
onto
a
broken
piece
of

effectively
impaling
her
through
the
heart

one
both
are
nicely
bound
in
folders
buffy
gives
willow
a
knowing
smile
willow
just
stares
at
him
in
stunned
amazement
percy
respectfully
um
and
i
know
they're
kinda
kinda
short
but
i
can
flesh
them
out
oh
and
here's
the
bibliography
percy
hands
it
to
her
um
and
i
can
retype
that
if
you
want
you
just
let
me
know
what
i
did
wrong
and
i'll
get
on
it
willow
is
speechless
amazed
by
his
sudden
change
in
attitude
he
starts
to
go
but
comes
back
to
lay
an
apple
on
the
folders
in
her
lap
he
leaves
again
hopping
athletically
over
a
low
wall
buffy
innocently
you
wanna
go
out
tonight
willow
hopefully

sound
good
