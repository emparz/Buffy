clean
slate
buffy
that's
what
you

piece
of
paper

mr
flutie
reads
whoa

torn
sheet

that
gym
was
full
of
vampi
asbestos
buffy
don't
worry
any
other
school
they
might
say
'watch
your
step'
or
'we'll
be
watching
you'
but
that's
just
not
the
way
here
we
want
to
service
your
needs
and
help
you
to
respect
our
needs
and
if
your
needs
and
our
needs
don't
mesh
he
puts
the
poorly
repaired
sheet
back
into
her
file
and
slaps
it
shut
she
gives
him
a
thin
nervous
smile
cut
to
the
hall
buffy
comes
out
of
mr
flutie's
office
she
opens
her
bag
and
rummages
through
it
as
she
walks
into
the
hall
right
in
front
of
a
girl
and
a
boy
the
girl
bumps
into
her
making
her
lose
her
grip
on
the
bag
and
spill
its
contents
oh
sorry
that's
okay
buffy
looks
down
at
the
mess
oh
xander
hears
the
noise
looks
back
quickly
comes
over
and
squats
down
next
to
her
to
help
her
gather
her
things
can
i
have
you
she
gives
him
a
confused
look
duh
xander
chuckles

buffy
smiles

i
i'm
buffy

new
xander
is
is
me
hi
xander
smiles
um
thanks
they
finish
gathering
up
everything
well
uh
maybe
i'll
see
you
around
maybe
at
school
since
we
both
go
there
great
buffy
they
stand
up
it
was
nice
to
meet
you
she
starts
down
the
hall
xander
unimpressed
with
himself
we
both
go
to
school
very
suave
very
not
pathetic
he
notices
a
stake
still
on
the
floor
oh
hey
xander
picks
it
up
hey
you
forgot
your
stake
buffy
doesn't
hear
him
and
continues
down
the
hall
xander
holds
on
to
the
stake
cut
to
a
classroom
the
teacher
writes
'the
black
death'
on
the
board
and
then
turns
to
the
class
it's
estimated
that
about
25
million
people
died
in
that
one
fouryear
span
but
the
fun
part
of
the
black
plague
is
that
it
originated
in
europe
how
cordelia
is
taking
notes
so
is
buffy
seated
next
to
her
as
an
early
form
of
germ
warfare
if
you'll
look
at
the
map
on
page
63
you
can
trace
the
spread
of
the
disease
into
rome
and
then
north
buffy
doesn't
have
a
book
and
looks
around
for
help
cordelia
notices
and
shares
her
book
buffy
to
cordelia
thanks
and
this
popular
plague
led
to
what
social
changes
steve
the
bell
rings
and
the
students
get
up
to
leave
hi
i'm
cordelia
cordelia
offers
her
hand
buffy
accepts
it
i'm
buffy
if
you're
looking
for
a
textbook
of
your
very
own
there's
probably
a
few
in
the
library
oh
great
thanks
buffy
they
get
up
where
would
that
be
i'll
show
you
come
on
cordelia
they
start
out
of
the
classroom
so
you're
from
hemery
right
in
la
uh
yeah
oh
i
would
kill
to
live
in
la
that
close
to
that
many
shoes
buffy
has
to
laugh
as
they
go
into
the
hall
cut
to
the
two
of
them
walking
down
another
part
of
the
hall
well
you'll
be
okay
here
if
you
hang
with
me
and
mine
you'll
be
accepted
in
no
time
of
course
we
do
have
to
test
your
coolness
factor
you're
from
la
so
you
can
skip
the
written
but
let's
see
vamp
nail
polish
um
over
so
over
james
spader
he
needs
to
call
me
frappaccinos
trendy
but
tasty
john
tesh
the
devil
that
was
pretty
much
a
gimme
but
you
passed
oh
goody
they
turn
toward
a
drinking
fountain
willow
is
there
she
straightens
up
and
sees
them
coming
willow
nice
dress
good
to
know
you've
seen
the
softer
side
of
sears
uh
oh
well
my
mom
picked
it
out
no
wonder
you're
such
a
guy
magnet
are
you
done
willow
looks
at
the
fountain
then
back
at
cordelia
oh
she
turns
and
leaves
buffy
watches
her
go
for
a
moment
then
looks
back
at
cordelia
after
she
starts
talking
again
you
wanna
fit
in
here
the
first
rule
is
know
your
losers
once
you
can
identify
them
all
by
sight
cordelia
glances
after
willow
they're
a
lot
easier
to
avoid
buffy
lets
out
a
nervous
laugh
and
nods
she
looks
at
willow
again
who
has
gone
through
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
willow
looks
back
at
them
before
she
continues
cut
to
another
area
in
the
halls
the
two
of
them
continue
their
walk
to
the
library
and
if
you're
not
too
swamped
with
catching
up
you
should
come
by
the
bronze
tonight
the
who
the
bronze
it's
the
only
club
worth
going
to
around
here
they
let
anybody
in
but
it's
still
the
scene
it's
in
the
bad
part
of
town
where's
that
buffy
stops
outside
the
library
doors
about
a
half
a
block
from
the
good
part
of
town
cordelia
laughing
we
don't
have
a
whole
lot
of
town
here
but

looks
toward
the
library
uh

everything
there
is
to

about
you
cordelia
waves
and
goes
buffy
waves
back
great
buffy
to
herself
oh
that
sounds
like
fun
she
goes
into
the
library
cut
to
inside
she
comes
in
and
looks
around
it
looks
deserted
hello
buffy
continues
in
is
anybody
here
she
looks
on
the
counter
and
sees
a
newspaper
with
a
picture
that's
been
circled
the
caption
above
the
picture
reads
'local
boys
still
missing'
giles
comes
up
behind
her
and
taps
her
on
the
shoulder
she
spins
around
startled
ooo
buffy
exhales
anybody's
here

i
help
you
i
was
looking
for
some
well
books

were
coming
he
heads
around
behind
the
counter
great
so
um
i'm
gonna
need
'perspectives
on
20th
century'
giles
buffy
interrupting
i
know
what
you're
after
with
a
big
grin
on
his
face
he
pulls
out
a
large
old
book
with
the
word
'vampyr'
written
in
gold
leaf
on
the
front
cover
buffy
looks
up
at
him
with
an
uneasy
gaze
that's
not
what
i'm
looking
for
are
you
sure
i'm
way
sure
giles
confused
my
mistake
he
puts
the
book
back
behind
the
counter
buffy
quickly
leaves
giles
straightening
back
up
so
what
is
it
you
said
he
sees
her
go
out
of
the
library
their
first
encounter
leaves
him
puzzled
cut
to
the
girls'
locker
room
two
girls
are
discussing
buffy
the
new
kid
she
seems
kind
of
weird
to
me
what
kind
of
name
is
buffy
hey
aphrodisia
oh
hey
well
the
chatter
in
the
caf
is
that
she
got
kicked
out
and
that's
why
her
mom
had
to
get
a
new
job
the
girls
work
the
combinations
to
their
gym
lockers
neg
pos
she
was
starting
fights
negly
aura
opening
her
locker
well
i
heard
from
blue
and
she
said
that
the
dead
boy
falls
out
of
the
locker
onto
aura's
arm
she
screams
and
lets
the
body
fall

outside
at
school
willow
is
sitting
on
a
bench
in
front
of
a
wall
taking
out
her
lunch
buffy
approaches
her
uh
hi
willow
right
willow
looks
up
why
ii
mean
hi
uh
did
you
want
me
to
move
why
don't
we
start
with
'hi
i'm
buffy'
and
uh
then
let's
segue
directly
into
me
asking
you
for
a
favor
buffy
sits
next
to
her
it
doesn't
involve
moving
but
it
does
involve
hanging
out
with
me
for
a
while
but
aren't
you
hanging
out
with
cordelia
i
can't
do
both
not
legally
buffy
exhales
look
i
really
wanna
get
by
here
new
school
and
cordelia's
been
really
nice
to
me
anyway
but
um
i
kinda
have
this
burning
desire
not
to
flunk
all
my
classes
and
i
heard
a
rumor
that
you
were
the
person
to
talk
to
if
i
wanted
to
get
caught
up
oh
i
could
totally
help
you
out
uh
if
you
have
sixth
period
free
we
could
meet
in
the
library
or
not
or
we
could
meet
someplace
quieter
louder
uh
that
place
just
kinda
gives
me
the
wiggins
oh
it
has
that
effect
on
most
kids
i
love
it
though
it's
a
great
collection
and
the
new
librarian
is
really
cool
he's
new
yeah
he
just
started
he
was
a
curator
at
some
british
museum
or
or
the
british
museum
i'm
not
sure
but
he
knows
everything
and
he
brought
all
these
historical
volumes
and
biographies
and
am
i
the
single
dullest
person
alive
not
at
all
xander
hops
up
on
the
wall
behind
the
girls
and
sits
on
it
between
them
jesse
stands
in
front
of
them
and
drops
his
bag
hey
you
guys
busy
are
we
interrupting

tosses
his
bag
to
jesse

his
own
buffy

is
jesse
and
that's
xander
oh
me
and
buffy
go
waaay
back
old
friends
very
close
then
there's
that
period
of
estrangement
where

as
people

are
like
old
times

feel

a
scary
home

this
xander
holds

fence

sneaks
up
to
an
outside
entrance

uses
her
strength
to
break
the
door
and
goes
in
looking
around
to
make
sure
no
one
sees
her
cut
to
the
locker
room
buffy
finds
the
body
and

into
the
light
yes
she
drops
her
bag
on
the
table
and
heads
up
the
stairs
'cause
it's
the
weirdest
thing
he's
got
two
little
little
holes
in
his
neck
and
all
his
blood's
been
drained
buffy
meets
him

bizarre
aren't
you
just
going
ooo
i
was
afraid
of
this
well
i
wasn't
it's
my
first
day
i
was
afraid
that
i
was
gonna
be
behind
in
all
my
classes
that
i
wouldn't
make
any
friends
that
i
would
have
last
month's
hair
i
didn't
think
there'd
be
vampires
on
campus
and
i
don't
care
then
why
are
you
here
to
tell
you
that
i
don't
care
which
i
don't
and
have
now
told
you
so
bye
buffy
turns
away
to
go
is
he
wwill
he

again
buffy
turns
back
who
the
boy
no
he's
just
dead
can
you
be
sure
to
make
you
a
vampire
they
have
to
suck
your
blood
and
then
you
have
to
suck
their
blood
it's
like
a
whole
big
sucking
thing
mostly
they're
just
gonna
kill
you
why
am
i
still
talking
to
you
buffy
turns
and
goes
down
the
stairs
giles
moves
over
to
the
railing
you
really
have
no
idea
what's
going
on
do
you
you
think
it's
coincidence
your
being
here
that
boy
was
just
the
beginning
oh
why
can't
you
people
just
leave
me
alone
because
you
are
the
slayer
giles
comes
down
the
stairs
into
each
generation
a
slayer
is
born
one
girl
in
all
the
world
a
chosen
one
one
born
with
the
strength
and
skill
to
hunt
the
vampires
buffy
interrupts
and
joins
in
with
the
strength
and
skill
to
hunt
the
vampires
to
stop
the
spread
of
their
evil
blah
blah
blah
i've
heard
it
okay
i
really
don't
understand
this
attitude
you
you've
accepted
your
duty
you
you've
slain
vampires
before
yeah
and
i've
both
been
there
and
done
that
and
i'm
moving
on
what
do
you
know
about
this
town
giles
goes
into
his
office
it's
two
hours
on
the
freeway
from
neiman
marcus
dig
a
bit
in
the
history
of
this
place
you'll
find
a
a
steady
stream
of
fairly
odd
occurrences
now
i
believe
this
whole
area
is
a
center
of
mystical
energy
giles
comes
back
with
four
books
that
things
gravitate
towards
it
that
that
that
you
might
not
find
elsewhere
giles
sets
them
on
the
table
like
vampires
he
puts
the
volumes
into
buffy's
arms
one
by
one
as
he
lists
off
various
monsters
and
demons
like
zombies
werewolves
incubi
succubi
everything
you've
ever
dreaded
was
under
your
bed
but
told
yourself
couldn't
be
by
the
light
of
day
they're
all
real
what
you
like
sent
away
for
the
timelife
series
ah
wwwyes

you
get
the
free
phone
um
the
calendar
cool
but
okay
buffy
gives
back
the
books
first
of
all
i'm
a
vampire
slayer
and
secondly
i'm
retired
hey
i
know
why
don't
you
kill
'em
ii'm
a
watcher
ii
haven't
the
skill
oh
come
on
stake
through
the
heart
a
little
sunlight
it's
like
falling
off
a
log
a
a
slayer
slays
a
watcher
watches
yes
no
giles
sets
down
the
books
he
he
trains
her
he
he
he
prepares
her
prepares
me
for
what
for
getting
kicked
out
of
school
for
losing
all
of
my
friends
for
having
to
spend
all
of
my
time
fighting
for
my
life
and
never
getting
to
tell
anyone
because
i
might
endanger
them
go
ahead
prepare
me
they
just
look
at
each
other
for
a
moment
buffy
exhales
turns
and
leaves
the
library
in
disgust
giles
hesitates
for
an
instant
giles
to
himself
damn
he
runs
after
buffy
xander
walks
out
from
behind
the
stacks
what
cut
to
the
hall
giles
catches
up
with
buffy
it's
getting
worse
what's
getting
worse
he
guides
her
over
to
the
wall
and
speaks
with
her
in
a
low
voice
the
influx
of
the
undead
the
supernatural
occurrences
it's
been
building
for
years
there's
a
reason
why
you're
here
and
a
reason
why
it's
now
because
now
is
the
time
my
mom
moved
here
she
tries
to
evade
him
but
he
puts
his
arm
out
to
stop
her
something's
coming
something
something
something
is
is
gonna
happen
here
soon
gee
can
you
vague
that
up
for
me
the
signs
as
far
as
i
can
tell
point
to
a
crucial
mystical
upheaval
very
soon
days
possibly
less
oh
come
on
this
is
sunnydale
how
bad
an
evil
can
there
be
here
cut
to
outside
the
school
the
camera
descends
behind
some
bushes
and
sinks
through
the
ground
into
the
lair
of
the
master
there
are
candles
everywhere
vampires
bearing
torches
are
gathering
the
camera
moves
around
the
lair
as
luke
speaks
and
eventually
comes
to
rest
on
him
the
sleeper
will
wake
the
sleeper
will
wake
the
sleeper
will
wake
the
sleeper
will
wake
and
the
world
will
bleed

very
nurturing
environment
which
is
just
what
you
need
well
actually
oh
not
too
nurturing
i
know
you're
sixteen
i've
read
all
about
the
dangers
of
overnurturing
buffy
goes
to
her
bed
and
lays
out
a
couple
of
outfits
it's
hard
new
town
and
everything
it
is
for
me

a
good
girl
buffy
joyce
pats
her
on
the
head
you

fell
in
with
the
wrong
crowd
but
that
is
all
behind
us
now
it
is
from
now
on
i
am
only
going
to
hang
out
with
the
living
buffy
they
let
go
of
their
hands
and
she
picks
up
her
dresses
i
mean
lively
people
buffy
heads
back
to
her
closet
with
an
awkward
look
on
her
face
hmm
okay
you
have
fun
cut
outside
later
that
evening
buffy
is
walking
down
a
dark
street
when
someone
appears
behind
her
she
senses
that
she
is
being
followed
after
walking
for
a
ways
when
she
gets
a
chance
she
ducks
down
an
alley
and
looks
around
for
a
place
to
hide
a
cat
yowls
and
kicks
some
cans
as
it
runs
away
she
spies
something
above
her
angel
comes
into
the
alley
but
doesn't
see
her
as
he
slowly
walks
along
the
camera
pulls
up
to
reveal
buffy
in
a
handstand
on
a
bar
high
above
the
pavement
when
angel
has
passed
underneath
her
she
swings
down
and
kicks
him
in
the
back
he
is
knocked
to
the
ground
and
buffy
positions
herself
above
him
with
a
foot
on
his
chest
ah
heh
is
there
a
problem
ma'am
yeah
there's
a
problem
why
are
you
following
me
i
know
what
you're
thinking
don't
worry
i
don't
bite
she
backs
off
and
lets
him
get
up
but
keeps
her
fighting
stance
truth
is
i
thought
you'd
be
taller
or
bigger
muscles
and
all
that
you're
pretty
spry
though
angel
massages
his
neck
what
do
you
want
the
same
thing
you
do
buffy
lets
down
her
guard
okay
what
do
i
want
angel
steps
toward
her
to
kill
them
to
kill
them
all
sorry
that's
incorrect
but
you
do
get
this
lovely
watch
and
a
year's
supply
of
turtle
wax
what
i
want
is
to
be
left
alone
she
starts
a
determined
walk
away
do
you
really
think
that's
an
option
anymore
you're
standing
at
the
mouth
of
hell
and
it's
about
to
open
she
stops
turns
to
him
and
looks
at
him
with
a
wideeyed
gaze
he
reaches
into
his
jacket
and
pulls
out
a
small
box
don't
turn
your
back
on
this
angel
tosses
her
the
box
you've
gotta
be
ready
what
for
for
the
harvest
who
are
you
let's
just
say
i'm
a
friend
angel
starts
to
leave
yeah
well
maybe
i
don't
want
a
friend
angel
turns
back
i
didn't
say
i
was
yours
he
leaves
buffy
stares
after
him
for
a
moment
then
opens
the
box
it
contains
a
silver
cross
and
chain
she
takes
it
out
holds
it
in
her
hand
and
takes
another
glance
in
his
direction
cut
to
outside
the
bronze
people
are
arriving
and
meeting
buffy
is
wearing
the
cross
around
her
neck
she
walks
up
to
the
entrance
gives
the
doorman
some
cash
and
goes
in
sprung
monkey
is
playing
believe
loudly
and
the
dance
floor
is
crowded
with
people
oh
i
just
want
to
believe
can
you
hear
me
can
you
see
me
what's
inside
of
me
oh
i
just
want
to
believe
if
my
life
can
have
a
purpose
help
me
to
believe
oh
i
just
want
to
believe
can
you
hear
me
can
you
see
me
what's
inside
of
me
oh
i
just
want
to
believe
if
my
life
can
have
a
purpose
help
me
to
believe
buffy
moves
to
the
music
a
bit
she
sees
a
guy
waving
in
her
direction
and
waves
back
then
notices
someone
behind
her
waving
back
and
pulls
her
hand
down
embarrassed
everybody
wants
to
find
the
circle
the
line
of
truth
that
has
no
end
because
so
many
nights
i've
slept
with
the
feeling
of
empty
and
i
say
right
now
i'm
ready
to
believe
she
finds
the
bar
and
sees
willow
sitting
there
hey
oh
hi
buffy
walks
around
her
and
sits
on
the
stool
next
to
her
willow
turns
to
face
her
hi
oh
you're
here
with
someone
no
i'm
just
here
i
thought
xander
was
gonna
show
up
oh
are
you
guys
going
out
no
we're
just
friends
we
used
to
go
out
but
we
broke
up
how
come
he
stole
my
barbie
willow
buffy
looks
confused
oh
we
were
five
oh
iii
don't
actually
date
a
whole
lot
lately
why
not
well
when
i'm
with
a
boy
i
like
it's
hard
for
me
to
say
anything
cool
or
or
witty
or
at
all
ii
can
usually
make
a
few
vowel
sounds
and
then
i
have
to
go
away
it's
not
that
bad
no
iit
is
i
think
boys
are
more
interested
in
a
girl
who
can
talk
you
really
haven't
been
dating
lately
it's
probably
easy
for
you
yeah
real
easy
ii
mean
you
don't
seem
too
shy
well
my
philosophy
do
you
wanna
hear
my
philosophy
yeah
i
do
life
is
short
life
is
short
not
original
i'll
grant
you
but
it's
true
you
know
why
waste
time
being
all
shy
and
worrying
about
some
guy
and
if
he's
gonna
laugh
at
you
seize
the
moment
'cause
tomorrow
you
might
be
dead
oh
that's
nice
buffy
looks
up
and
sees
giles
on
the
upper
level
um
i'll
be
back
in
a
minute
buffy
gets
up
to
go
oh
thathat's
okay
you
don't
have
to
come
back
buffy
smiles
i'll
be
back
in
a
minute
willow
to
herself
seize
the
moment
cut
to
buffy
making
her
way
to
the
stairs
the
camera
follows
her
up
i
feel
love
with
my
friends
i
feel
love
in
my
songs
if
i
could
just
hold
love
then
all
the
answers
might
come
i
said
oh
if
we're
all
children
of
god
and
we
just
turned
away
i
got
a
lack
of
belief
i
said
a
world
without
faith
it's
time
we
turn
back
around
buffy
finds
giles
so
you
like
to
party
with
the
students
isn't
that
kinda
skanky
oh
right
this
is
me
having
fun
watching
clown
hair
prance
about
is
hardly
my
idea
of
a
party
i'd
much
rather
be
at
home
with
a
cup
of
bovril
and
a
good
book
you
need
a
personality
stat
giles
points
to
the
crowd
below
this
is
a
perfect
breeding
ground
for
vampire
activity
it's
dark
it's
crowded
besides
i
knew
you
were
likely
to
show
up
and
i
have
to
make
you
understand
that
the
harvest
is
coming
i
know
your
friend
told
me
what
did
you
say
the
harvest
that
mean
something
to
you
'cause
i'm
drawing
a
blank
i'm
not
sure
uh
wwho

you
this
this
guy
dark
gorgeous
in
an
annoying
sort
of
way
i
figured

two
were
buds

harvest
did
he
say
anything
else
something
about
the
mouth
of
hell
i
really
didn't
like
him
the
band

finished
its
song
and
there's
lots
of
applause
they
soon
start
their
next
song
swirl
giles
moves
around
buffy
leans
on
the
railing
and
looks
down
at
the
crowd
look
at
them
throwing
themselves
about
completely
unaware
of
the
danger
that
surrounds
them
lucky
them

you're
right
perhaps
there
is
no
trouble
coming
the
signs

be
wrong

been
having
the
nightmares

prowling
cut
to
buffy
and
giles
on
the
upper
level
i
didn't
say
i'd
never
slay
another
vampire
it's
not
like
i
have
all
these
fluffy
bunny
feelings
for
them
i'm
just
not
gonna
get
way
extracurricular
with
it
you
know
if
i
see
one

i'll
giles
interrupting
will
you
be
ready
there's
so
much
you
don't
know
about
them
about
your
own
powers
a
vampire
appears
to
be
completely
normal
until
the
feed
is
upon
them
only
then
do
they
reveal
their
true
demonic
visage
you're
like
a
textbook
with
arms
i
know
this
the
point
is
a
slayer
should
be
able
to
see
them
anyway
without
looking
without
thinking
can
you
tell
me
if
there's
a
vampire
in
this
building
maybe
you
should
know
even
through
this
mass
and
this
din
you
should
be
able
to
sense
them
well
try
reach
out
with
your
mind
giles
buffy
looks
around
you
have
to
hone
your
senses
focus
until
the
energy
washes
over
you
until
you
you
feel
every
particle
oof
there's
one
wwhere
right
there
talking
to
that
girl
you
don't
know
oh
please
look
at
his
jacket

got
the
sleeves
rolled
up
and
the
shirt
deal
with
that
outfit
for
a
moment
it's
dated
it's
carbon
dated
trust
me
only
someone
living
underground
for
ten
years
would
think
that
was
still
the
look
but
you
didn't
hone
buffy
notices
that
the
girl
is
