fighto
kendra
considers

offer
a
moment
then
relaxes
her

and
crosses
her

i

scenario
so

by
my
watcher
to

what
exactly
to
do
my
duty
i

here
to
kill
vampires
cut
to
the
back
room
at
willy's
bar
the
camera
pans
from
the
window
over
to
the
cage
the
sunlight
has
advanced
past
the
cage
door
and
is
only
about
three
feet
from
the
far
wall
angel
is
crouched
in
the
far
corner
cowering
and
afraid
he
looks
up
at
the
light
coming
through
the
window
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

the
library
kendra
stands
at
attention
as
giles
paces
buffy
just
leans
on
a
chair
with
her
left
hand
and
has
her
right
hand
on
her
hip
and
your
watcher
is
iis
sam
zabuto
you
say
yes
sir
we've
never
met
but
he
he's
he's
very
wellrespected
what
so
he's
a
real
guy
as
in
nonfictional
and
you
are
called
i
am
de
vampire
slayer
we
got
that
part
hon
he
means
your
name
oh
dey
call
me
kendra
i
have
no
last
name
sir
buffy
haughty
can
you
say
'stuck
in
the
80's'
buffy
please
uh
there's
obviously
some
some
misunderstanding
here
willow
comes
bouncing
into
the
library
with
a
smile
on
her
face
kendra
marches
around
buffy
to
intercept
her
willow
greets
them
hey
identify
yourself
willow
is
taken
aback
and
her
smile
fades
to
a
frown
back
off
pink
ranger
this
is
my
friend
friend
yeah
as
in
person
you
hang
with
amigo
i
don't
understand
buffy
to
giles
exasperated
you
try
i'm
tapped
buffy
sits
uhuh
kendra
uh
there
are
aaa
few
people
uh
cicivilians
if
you
like
who
who
know
buffy's
identity
willow
is
one
of
them
aa
and
they
also
um
spend
time
together
uh
socially
and
you
allow
dis
sir
well
uh
but
de
slayer
must
work
in
secret
for
security
of
course
uh
but
uh
with
buffy
however
itit's
um
some
flexibility
is
required
buffy
gives
giles
a
look
why
willow
confused
hi
guys
wwhat's
goin'
on
willow
goes
to
sit
across
from
buffy
apparently
there's
been
a
really
big
mixup
uh
it
seems
somehow
that
uh
another
slayer
has
been
sent
to
sunnydale
is
that
even
possible
i
mean
two
slayers
at
the
same
time
not
to
my
knowledge
um
ththe
new
slayer
is
only
called
after
the
previous
slayer
has
died
uh
giles
realizes
oh
good
lord
you
were
dead
buffy
i
was
only
gone
for
a
minute
clearly
it
doesn't
matter
how
long
you
were
gone
you
were
physically
dead
thus
causing
the
activation
of
the
the
next
slayer
giles
nods
toward
kendra
she
died
just
a
little
she
drowned
but
she
was
revived
so
there
really
are
two
of
them
it
would
seem
so
this
is
completely
unprecedented
i'm
quite
flummoxed
giles
sits
what's
the
flum
it's
a
mistake
she
isn't
supposed
to
be
here
she
goes
home
buffy
to
kendra
look
no
offense
i
really
don't
mean
this
personally
but
i'm
not
dead
and
frankly
having
you
around
creeps
me
out
just
a
little
bit
i
cannot
just
leave
i
was
sent
here
for
a
reason
mr
zabuto
said
all
de
signs
indicate
dat
a
very
dark
power
is
about
to
rise
in
sunnydale
buffy
gets
up
and
what's
your
great
plan
for
finding
this
dark
power
you
just
gonna
attack
people
randomly
till
you
find
a
bad
one
of
course
not
then
why
the
hell
did
you
attack
me
i
tought
you
were
a
vampire
oh
a
swing
and
a
miss
for
the
rookie
buffy
walks
around
kendra
to
willow
i
had
good
reason
to
tink
you
were
did
i
not
see
you
kissing
a
vampire
willow
stands
up
in
her
defense
buffy
would
never
do
that
willow
realizes
oh
willow
to
buffy
except
for
that
sometimes
you
do
that
willow
to
kendra
but
only
with

buffy

sunnydale
high
giles
kendra
willow

come
down

ii've
uh
conferred
with
your

mr
zabuto
and
uh
we
both
agree
that
uh
until

matter
with
spike
and
drusilla
has
been
resolved
that
you
two
should
work
together

a
treat
so
you
believe
dat
spike
is
attempting
to
revive
dis
drusilla

uh
the
dark

uh
you
see
drusilla's
not

no
absolutely
no
telling
what
she
might
do
den
we
will
stop
spike

a
little
more
complicated
than

john
wayne

also
called
out
the
order
of

look
from
buffy
'cause
that
would
be
cool
willow
rolls
her
eyes
after

i
realized
that
uh
the
handbook

do
you

it
would
be
of
no
use
in
my
case
wha

you'd
like
to
show
me

the
part
in
uh
dramius
six
where
uh
uh
where
it
refers
to
the
order
of
taraka
really
ii
i
seem
to
have
never
been
able
to
get
through
that
book
it
was
a
bit
stodgy
kendra
smiles
it
was
difficult
all
dose
footnotes
giles
and
kendra
laugh
out
loud
buffy
to
willow
hello

planet
pocket
protector

bbuffy
principal
snyder
was
snooping
round
after
you
buffy
stops
eee
career
fair
best
make
an
appearance
i
think
right
buffy's
a
student
here
yes
riiight
of
course
and
i
imagine
she's
a
cheerleader
as
well
oh
no
well
aaactually
she
had
to
give
up
her
cheerleading
giles
gets
a
look
from
kendra
uh
it
was
quite
an
amusing
story
actually
uh
uh
let's
go
and
find
the
book
shall
we
the
two
of
them
head
off
to
the
library
buffy
and
willow
continue
their
walk
get
a
load
of
the
shegiles
creepy
ew
i'll
bet

enough
of
a
book
geek
for
the
both
of
you

mean
maybe
after
this

could
say
'kendra

slay
i'm
going
to
disneyland'
willow
but
not
forever
right
no
disneyland
would
get
boring
after
a
few
months
but
i
could
do
other
stuff
career
day
stuff
maybe
i
could
even
have
a
normal
life
cut
to
buffy's
basement
cordelia
is
pacing
could
you
sit
down
or
change
your
pattern
or
something
you're
making
me
queasy
cordelia
leans
on
the
washer
because
you're
just
sitting
there
you
should
be
thinking
up
a
plan
i
have
a
plan
we
wait
buffy
saves
us
how
will
she
even
know
where
to
find
us
cordelia
this
is
buffy's
house
odds
are
she'll
find
us
well
what
if
she
doesn't
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
just
waste
away
down
here
with
you
haw
haw
no
thank
you
cordelia
makes
tracks
for
the
stairs
xander
gets
up
to
stop
her
what
are
you
doin'
cordelia
stops
and
faces
him
going
to
see
if
he's
gone
that's
brilliant
what
if
he
isn't
oh
right
you
think
we
should
just
slack
here
and
hope
that
somebody
else
decides
to
be
a
hero
cordelia
goes
back
to
the
washer
sorry
forgot
i
was
stranded
with
a
loser
cordelia
leans
and
crosses
her
arms
and
yet
i
never
forgot
that
i'm
stuck
with
the
numbbrain
that
let
mr
mutant
in
the
house
in
the
first
place
he
looked
normal
what
is
he
supposed
to
have
an
arrow
with
the
word
'assassin'
over
his
head
all
it
took
was
the
prospect
of
a
free
makeover
and
you
licked
his
hand
like
a
big
dumb
dog
you
know
what
cordelia
heads
for
the
stairs
again
i'm
going
xander
just
raises
his
eyebrows
ready
to
let
her
go
she
stops
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
faces
him
again
i'd
rather
be
worm
food
than
look
at
your
pathetic
face
then
go
i'm
not
stopping
ya
i
bet
you
wouldn't
i
bet
you'd
let
a
girl
go
off
to
her
doom
all
by
herself
not
just
any
girl
xander
nods
you're
special
i
can't
believe
that
i'm
stuck
spending
what
will
probably
be
my
last
few
moments
on
earth
here
with
you
i
hope
these
are
my
last
few
moments
three
more
seconds
with
you
and
i'm
gonna
xander
steps
closer
cordelia
steps
closer

they
look
at
each
other
for
another
second
before
grabbing
each
other
and
engaging
in
a
mad
passionate
kiss
it
goes
on
for
several
seconds
before
they
suddenly
release
each
other
and
look
at
each
other
in
surprise
we
so
need
to
get
outta
here
cordelia
nods
mmhm
she
rushes
up
the
stairs
with
xander
right
behind
they
stop
at
the
top
crouch
down
and
give
each
other
anxious
looks
xander
grabs
one
end
of
the
tape
and
pulls
it
off
there
aren't
any
worms
on
the
other
side
xander
moves
the
broom
aside
and
opens
the
door
slowly
they
both
look
out
into
the
hall
for
any
sign
of
the
mealworms

gone
xander
steps
out
and
peeks
around
the
corner
down
the
hall
to
the
dining
room
the
coast
looks
clear
so
xander
makes
a
dash
for
the
front
door
cordelia
follows
a
moment
later
and
when
she
comes
through
the
dining
room
door
mealworms
begin
falling
onto
her
from
the
ceiling
she
screams
as

fall
on
her
en
masse
and
runs
for
the
door
cut
outside

throws
the
door
open
and
dashes
into

out
screaming

and
starts
spraying
the
mealworms
off
of
her

keeps
screaming
and
turns
her
back
to
him

tries
to
brush
them
off
she
turns

reaches
down
the
back
of
her
dress
to

she
runs
for
her
car
xander
follows
her
with
the
hose
for
another
instant
then
drops
it
and
follows
her
cut

to
come
around

camera
pans
to

his

willow
raises
her
eyebrows
at
them
cut
to
the
office
kendra
is
handling
a
stake
your
life
is
very
different
dan
mine
you
mean
the
part
where
i
occasionally
have
one
yeah
i
guess
it
is
buffy
carves
at
a
stake
de
tings
you
do
and
have
i
was
taught
distract
from
my
calling
friends
school
even
family
even
family
my
parents
dey
sent
me
to
my
watcher
when
i
was
very
young
how
young
i
don't
remember
dem
actually
i've
seen
pictures
but
uh
dat's
how
seriously
de
calling
is
taken
by
my
people
my
modder
and
fadder
gave
me
to
my
watcher
because
dey
believed
dat
dey
were
doing
de
right
ting
for
me
and
for
de
world
kendra
puts
down
the
stake
and
gets
a
sympathetic
look
from
buffy
please
i
don't
feel
sorry
for
meself
why
should
you
i
don't
know
i
i
guess
it
just
sounds
very
lonely
emotions
are
weakness
buffy
you
shouldn't
entertain
dem
kendra
my
emotions
give
me
power
they're
total
assets
kendra
picks
up
her
knife
maybe
for
you
but
i
prefer
to
keep
an
even
mind
kendra
wipes
the
blade
buffy
puts
down
her
knife
mm
i
guess
that
explains
it
explains
what
buffy
plays
with
the
stake
oh
well
when
we
were
fighting
uh
you're
amazing
your
technique
it's
flawless
it's
hmm
better
than
mine
i
know
still
i
woulda
kicked
your
butt
in
the
end
and
ya
know
why
no
imagination
kendra
rubs
her
blade
more
vigorously
really
ya
tink
so
kendra
puts
down
the
rag
oh
i
know
so
you're
good
but
power
alone
isn't
enough
a
good
fighter
needs
to
know
how
to
improvise
to
go
with
the
flow
uhuh
seriously
don't
get
me
wrong
yyou
really
do
have
potential
buffy
puts
away
the
stake
kendra
holds
her
knife
ready
potential
i
could
wipe
de
floor
wit
you
right
now
buffy
looks
kendra
in
the
eye
that
would
be
anger
you're
feeling
what
you
feel
it
right
how
the
anger
gives
you
fire
a
slayer
needs
that
they

look
over
at
xander
as
he
walks
into
the

while
he
grabs
a
book
from
the
desk
xander
notices
her
knife
nice

i'm
guessing
dating

big
with
your
watcher

i'm
not
permitted
to
speak
with
boys
unless
you're
pummeling
them
buffy

what
drusilla
