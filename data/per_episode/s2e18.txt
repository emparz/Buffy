the
cemetery
the
camera
closes
in
on
the
top
of
the
perimeter
wall
a
pair
of
hands
hook
over
the
top
and
buffy
pulls
herself
up
she
coughs
while
she
pulls
her
legs
over
she
jumps
down
the
other
side
when
she
hits
the
ground
she
can't
keep
her
balance
and
has
to
use
her
hands
to
keep
from
toppling
over
she
breathes
heavily
through
her
mouth
because
her
nose
is
stuffed
up
every
now
and
then
she
sniffles
she
pulls
a
stake
out
of
her
jacket
she
puts
her
hand
on
her
forehead
and
moans
as
she
stands
up
slowly
she
starts
to
make
her
way
across
the
graveyard
cut
to
in
front
of
her
the
camera
follows
her
as
she
walks
still
sniffling
and
rubbing
her
nose
she
senses
something
and
tries
to
concentrate
while
she
slowly
approaches
a
small
mausoleum
she
raises
her
stake
and
jumps
around
the
corner
swinging
it
to
strike
at
whatever's
there
xander
screams
and
reflexively
jumps
back
holding
on
tightly
to
his
own
stake
cordelia
lets
out
a
highpitched
scream
behind
him
willow
is
there
too
and
the
girls
both
reflexively
hold
up
crosses
at
buffy
nonvampire
plus
two
willow
sternly
as
she
puts
her
cross
away
hi

away
buffy
this
is
not
the
time
to

ultimate
fighting
championship
xander
gestures
with
his
stake
he's
at
full
strength
you're
only
half
a
slayer
yeah
but
i'm
still
the
slayer
and
as
long
as
i
am
angel's
not
gonna
kill
anybody
else
angelus
behind
her
aw
c'mon
angelus
she
turns
to
face
him
just
one
more
he
attacks
and
the
girls
scream
he
runs
right
past
buffy
straight
for
cordelia
and
tackles
her
to
the
ground
buffy
grabs
him
by
the
back
of
his
coat
and
pulls
him
off
of
her
she
turns
him
around
takes
him
by
the
coat
collar
and
swings
at
him
with
her
stake

blocks
her
with

hers
and
makes
her
drop
the
stake
not
feeling
well
lover
buffy
looks
up
at
him
and
punches
him
in
the
jaw
he
glares
back
at
her
and
tries
to
kick
her
but
she
grabs
his
foot
and
shoves
his
leg
up
making
him
fall
hard
onto
his
back
that
helps
angelus
scrambles
to
all
fours
she
comes
at
him
from
behind
and
tries
to
kick
him
but
he
kicks
out
with
his
leg
into
her
chest
and
she
staggers
back
a
ways
until
she
regains
her
balance
he
gets
up
and
comes
toward
her
she
takes
a
couple
of
swings
at
him
but
he
evades
them
easily
he
blocks

her
arm
and
takes
her
by
the
throat

and
she
stumbles
backward
again

punches
her
in
the
gut
then
grabs
her
by
the
neck
and
shoves
her
around
and
into
a
corner
column
of
the
small
mausoleum
she
is
dazed
and
tries
to
regain
her
balance
but
doesn't
get
a
chance
because

wastes
no
time
punching
her
in
the

sunnydale
general
xander
is
sitting
on
a
chair
outside
the
waiting
room
across
from
the
nurses'
station
that
is
down
the
hall
from
buffy's
room
there
are
two
police
officers
talking
to
a
security
guard
nurses
and
orderlies
are
going
about
their
tasks
angelus
comes
walking
out
of
the
waiting
room
from
the
elevator
bearing
some
white
flowers
and
whistling
a
few
bars
of
ode
to
joy
from
beethoven's
9th
symphony
xander
hears
him
and
looks
to
see
who's
coming
when
he
sees
angelus
he
quickly
gets
up
and
faces
him
down
in
the
hall
visiting
hours
are
over
well
i'm
pretty
much
family
xander
trying
hard
to
stay
cool
yeah
why
don't
you
come
back
during
the
day
oh
gee
no
i
guess
you
can't
angelus
threateningly
if
i
decide
to
walk
into
buffy's
room
do
you
think
for
one
microsecond
that
you
could
stop
me
maybe
not
maybe
that
security
guard
couldn't
either
or
those
cops
or
the
orderlies
but
i'm
kinda
curious
to
find
out
you
game
angelus
pauses
buffy's
white
knight
you
still
love
her
angelus
leans
in
close
it
must
just
eat
you
up
that
i
got
there
first
xander
fighting
his
nervousness
you're
gonna
die
and
i'm
gonna
be
there
angelus
slaps
the
flowers
against
xander's
chest
tell
her
i
stopped
by
he
gives
xander
one
final
look
and
then
goes
back
through
the
waiting
room
to
the
elevator
xander
shudders
covers
his
mouth
and
lets
out
a
breath
of
relief
cut
to
a
flashback
of
little
buffy
and
celia
celia
is
on
the
bedroom
floor
covered
with
pillows
and
writhing
around
pretending
to
be
trapped
under
a
pile
of
snow
and
ice
help
me
help
avalanche
help
help
i'm
trapped
avalanche
help
help
little
buffy
comes
in
through
the
door
and
stops
in
a
heroic
stance
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
power
girl
to
the
rescue
she
kneels
down
and
starts
to
heave
off
the
pillows
as
though
they're
huge
heavy
blocks
of
ice
and
snow
and
thuds
them
aside
help
me
help
help
please
help
buffy
gets
the
last
pillows
off
of
celia's
face
and
she
sits
up
you
saved
me
thank
you
power
girl
the
two
girls
embrace
you're
safe
now
cut
to
a
flashback
of
little
buffy
coming
into
celia's
hospital
room
she
slowly
approaches
the
curtain
around
the
bed
and
opens
it
enough
to
look
in
at
her
cousin
she
steps
through
celia
is
lying
there
peacefully
asleep
cut
to
buffy
in
her
hospital
bed
she
wakes
with
a
start
dr
wilkinson
coming
in
good
morning
buffy
moans
rubs
her
eyes
and
sits
up
could've
fooled
me
how
are
you
feeling
looks
like
your
fever's
gone
down
well
good
thanks
for
having
me
let's
try
and
keep
in
touch
buffy
tries
to
get
out
of
bed
dr
wilkinson
pushes
her
back
not
so
fast
dr
wilkinson
inspects
buffy's
bandaged
arm
hmm
good
'hmm'
or
bad
'hmm'
swelling's
gone
dr
wilkinson
looks
up
does
this
hurt
nope
amazing
dr
wilkinson
gets
the
chart
well
then
i
should
probably
go
right
buffy
tries
to
go
again
dr
wilkinson
stops
her
again
no
soon
we
have
to
make
sure
that
fever
is
gone
that's
a
strong
virus
you
have
maybe
not
as
strong
as
you
but
iis
that
the
same
virus
the
kids
have
before
dr
wilkinson
can
answer
there's
a
knock
on
the
door
may
we
come
in
please
dr
wilkinson
they
all
come
in
maybe
you
can
keep
our
patient
from
bolting
dr
wilkinson
to
buffy
sternly
rest
hmm
dr
wilkinson
leaves
xander
presenting
five
balloons
flowers
for
milady
buffy
looks
up
at
them
i
think
they
call
those
balloons
xander
looks
up
yeah
stick
'em
in
water
maybe
they'll
grow
not
to
be
outdone
willow
sets
school
books
on
the
bed
homework
it's
my
way
of
saying
'get
well
soon'
you
know
chocolate
says
that
even
better
i
did
all
your
assignments
all
you
have
to
do
is
sign
your
name
giles
munches
on
a
grape
chocolate
means
nothing
to
me
willow
steps
back
and
looks
up
at
cordelia
nobody
told
me
i
was
supposed
to
bring
a
gift
cordelia
looks
at
giles
i
was
out
of
the
loop
on
gifts
it's
it's
tradition
among
um
people
um
giles
walks
up
to
the
bed
grapes
giles
sets
down
the
bag
well
did
you
uh
pass
the
night
well
enough
a
nurse
comes
into
the
room
and
walks
around
the
bed
not
really
something
happened
i
thought
you
the
nurse
checks
buffy's
iv
you
know
what
let's
take
a
walk
cut
to
outside
the
hospital
main
entrance
the
camera
pans
over
to
willow
pushing
buffy
along
in
a
wheelchair
while
the
others
walk
alongside
now
this
part
i
could
get
used
to
do
you
want
me
to
go
real
fast
willow
gets
a
look
from
giles
not
that
i
would
we
were
discussing
um
stuff
yes
stuff
um
you
know
a
girl
died
here
last
night
how
well
the
flu
flu
doesn't
exactly
sound
monsterrific
i
know
but
there's
this
dr
backer
and
he's
been
giving
them
these
experimental
treatments
they
stop
by
a
bench
and
giles
sits
ii'm
not
sure
what
he's
up
to
but
he's
a
little
creepy
aand
then
there
was
this
kid
ryan
he
said
he
saw
something
saw
what
death
death
the
death
as
in
'it
is
your
time'
buffy
aaa
frightened
child
yeah
but
i
thought
i
saw
something
i'm
not
sure
i
was
really
out
of
it
but
but
you
do
know
that
you
saw
death
did
it
have
an
hourglass
ooo
if
he
asks
you
to
play
chess
don't
even
do
it
the
guy's
like
a
whiz
maybe
it
wasn't
death
maybe
it
was
something
else
so
this
isn't
about
you
being
afraid
of
hospitals
'cause
your
friend
died
and
you
wanna
conjure
up
a
monster
that
you
can
fight
so
you
can
save
everybody
and
not
feel
so
helpless
cordelia
have
you
actually
ever
heard
of
tact
tact
is
just
not
saying
true
stuff
i'll
pass
your
mom
did
tell
us
about
your
cousin
cordelia
sits
also
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
this
little
boy
ryan
is
afraid
of
something
something
real
as
long
as
i'm
forced
to
stay
here
i'm
gonna
find
out
what
so
is
this
the
part
where
we
say
what
can
we
do
to
help
cut
to
the
hospital
records
room
after
hours
that
evening
the
place
is
deserted
cordelia
and
xander
quietly
come
in
cordelia
whispers
you
had
to
ask
that
didn't
you
they
walk
over
to
a
records
cabinet
xander
quietly
pft
it'll
be
cake
just
gotta
figure
out
what
killed
this
little
girl
tina
we'll
be
out
five
minutes
tops
xander
opens
a
cabinet
door
cordelia
leans
against
the
wall
this
is
what
happens
when
you're
compassionate
towards
sick
people
they
take
advantage
of
you
xander
gives
cordelia
a
look
uhhuh
buffy
almost
died
just
to
put
you
out
i
didn't
wanna
be
the
first
one
to
say
it
he
finds
nothing
and
points
over
to
the
cabinet
to
his
right
you
there
xander
points
to
his
left
me
here
right
he
goes
on
the
next
one
around
the
corner
she
reluctantly
goes
back
to
the
one
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
where
they
came
in
she
opens
the
cabinet
and
looks
in
suddenly
a
security
guard
appears
next
to
her
and
she
jumps
and
gasps
what
are
you
doing
here
she
gives
him
a
worried
smile
and
lets
out
a
breath
cut
to
the
library
willow
and
giles
come
walking
in
so
where
do
we
start
hmm
oh
i
don't
know
maybe
look
into
the
history
of
the
hospital
bizarre
incidents
that
sort
of
thing
i'm
sensing
a
little
less
than
full
committal
here
they
stop
by
the
counter
oh
ii
suppose
so
cordelia
may
be
giles
inhales
homerically
insensitive
but
she
may
also
be
right
death
and
disease
are
are
things
possibly
the
only
things
that
that
buffy
cannot
fight
it's
only
natural
for
her
to
try
to
create
aa
defeatable
opponent
especially
now
after
after
jenny
willow
gives
giles
a
sad
look
that's
true
but
on
the
'we
live
on
the
hellmouth'
side
these
kids
may
have
seen
a
monster
giles
starts
toward
the
stacks
what
a
monster
that
grownups
can't
see
doesn't
ring
a
bell
giles
pauses
unless
willow
sits
on
the
table
unless
well
sometimes
small
children
do
see
something
we
adults
don't
us
our
true
selves
our
our
our
hidden
faces
so
the
kids
might
be
afraid
of
a
regular
person
willow
realizes
like
the
weird
doctor
stanley
backer
was
his
name
no
let's
look
him
up
willow
goes
to
get
her
laptop
cut
back
to
the
hospital
records
room
cordelia
has
the
guard
wrapped
around
her
finger
she
smiles
sweetly
at
him
and
pretends
to
be
interested
as
he
leans
against
the
wall
and
talks
you
know
most
people
think
that
security
guards
are
just
guys
that
failed
the
police
exam
but
that's
not
me
this
is
my
career
stereotypes
are
so
unfair
i
did
take
the
fireman's
exam
though
i
didn't
do
so
good
oh
well
you
know
i
think
that
security
guards
cordelia
plays
with
his
badge
are
way
sexier
than
firemen
they're
all
sooty
well
this
is
where
all
the
action
is
anyhow
i'm
all
the
time
restraining
people
cut
to
xander
behind
the
other
storage
cabinets
he's
found
the
file
he
wants
and
is
waiting
and
listening
for
an
opportunity
to
get
out
mm
how
thrilling
cordelia
cut
to
her
do
you
ever
get
scared
'fear
is
for
the
weak'
that's
my
motto
either
that
or
'live
in
the
now'
i
haven't
decided
yet
i
bet
you
see
a
lot
of
tragedy
you
know
like
that
little
girl
oh
one
of
dr
backer's
patients
dr
backer's
a
great
man
he
understands
cut
to
xander
he
cringes
at
what
he's
hearing
and
thuds
lightly
back
into
the
cabinet
the
real
truth
about
children
cordelia
cut
to
her
what's
that
sometimes
they
die
cordelia
closes
her
eyes
xander
makes
another
bumping
noise
this
time
loud
enough
that
the
security
guard
hears
it
what
was
that
guard
draws
his
baton
uh
you
know
i
didn't
hear
anything
cordelia
tries
to
get
his
attention
you
know
you
have
the
most
perfect
nose
i've
ever
seen
he
turns
to
face
her
she
giggles
and
reaches
up
her
finger
to
run
it
over
his
forehead
and
down
the
length
of
his
nose
behind
the
guard
xander
steps
over
to
the
door
quietly
opens
it
and
goes
out
you
must
work
out
guard
gives
her
a
little
growl
yeah
cordelia
smiles
and
nods
her
head
mmhm
cut
to
the
hall
outside
the
records
room
xander
waits
around
the
corner
for
cordelia
she
walks
around
it
and
lets
out
a
surprised
gasp
when
she
runs
into
him
there
could
you
make
just
a
little
more
with
the
touchygropey
jealous
of
rogaine
boy
xander
chuckles
i
don't
think
so
xander
hands
her
the
file
here
take
this
to
giles
okay
what
about
you
i'm
gonna
stay
here
oh
right
your
obsession
with
protecting
buffy
have
i
told
you
how
attractive
that's
not
cordelia
someone's
gotta
watch
her
back
yeah
well
i've
seen
you
watch
her
back
what
is
that
supposed
to
mean
well
i
was
using
the
phrase
'watch
her
back'
as
a
euphemism
for
'looking
at
her
butt'
you
know
sort
of
a
pun
oh
right
xander
gets
the
insult
hey
well
you
do
jealous
fine
watch
my
back
she
walks
past
him
and
down
the
hall
he
turns
around
and
watches
her
go
he
tilts
his
head
to
check
out
her
butt
but
quickly
straightens
back
up
again
cut
to
the
hall
outside
the
children's
ward
buffy
comes
along
stops
by
the
door
and
looks
into
the
room
ryan
is
sitting
at
a
table
drawing
a
picture
with
crayons
buffy
walks
over
to
him
hey
remember
me
you
shouldn't
be
here
why
not
contagious
nah
i
already
got
what
you
got
she
sits
down
by
the
table
ryan
goes
back
to
drawing
his
picture
oh
what
you
think
because
i'm
a
grownup
believe
me
i'm
not
that
grown
up
she
takes
a
look
at
his
picture
it's
of
the
monster
that
he's
seen
coming
after
the
other
kids
buffy
briefly
flashes
back
to
when
she
saw
it
walk
past
her
door
in
her
dream
he'll
come
again
tonight
ryan
listen
to
me
buffy
he
looks
at
her
i'm
not
gonna
let
this
thing
hurt
you
any
of
you
grownups
don't
believe
you
right
well
i
do
we
both
know
that
there
are
real
monsters
but
there's
also
real
heroes
that
fight
monsters
and
that's
me
he
looks
away
and
goes
back
to
drawing
his
picture
can't
fight
death
cut
to
the
library
willow
is
sitting
at
the
table
surfing
for
information
on
her
laptop
giles
is
standing
behind
her
looking
over
her
shoulder
dr
backer's
medical
database
file
comes
up
on
the
screen
our
dr
backer
has
something
of
a
rap
sheet
reprimands
for
controversial
experiments
risky
procedures
a
malpractice
suit
looks
like
it
was
dropped
suddenly
giles
takes
off
his
glasses
factor
in
buffy's
observation
that
he
gives
her
the
um
uh
wiggins
giles
turns
away
and
thinks
this
may
be
our
death
guy
giles
turns
back
to
her
i
just
wish
i
knew
what
he
was
doing
to
these
children
she
looks
up
at
him
cut
to
a
deserted
hall
in
the
hospital
cut
to
dr
backer's
office
he's
deep
into
his
research
and
mutters
under
his
breath
he
looks
up
from
his
printouts
and
steps
over
to
his
refrigerator
he
opens
it
pulls
a
specimen
from
a
rack
checks
the
label
and
marks
it
he
puts
the
test
tube
back
closes
the
fridge
and
reaches
for
a
reference
volume
on
his
desk
he
sits
back
down
as
he
quickly
leafs
through
it
and
finds
the
page
he
wants
he
reads
it
back
to
himself
and
jots
some
notes
onto
his
papers
yes

cut
to
the
hall
xander
is
sitting
on
a
chair
waiting
out
his
self
imposed
sentry
duty
he
nearly
nods
off
but
jerks
his
head
back
up
cut
to
the
table
between
his
chair
and
the
next
one
a
bag
of
krispy
kreme
doughnuts
plops
down
onto
it
the
camera
pulls
back
and
cordelia
walks
in
front
of
it
and
sets
down
a
tray
with
two
cups
of
coffee
xander
looks
up
at
her
as
she
sits
down
she
looks
back
at
him
then
turns
her
attention
to
a
copy
of
cosmopolitan
that
she
brought
with
her
xander
reaches
for
one
of
the
coffees
he
gives
cordelia
another
look
and
takes
the
bag
of
doughnuts
also
he
takes
a
long
sip
of
coffee
and
then
opens
the
bag
cut
to
the
hall
outside
dr
backer's
office
he
walks
out
and
the
camera
precedes
him
as
he
makes
his
way
to
the
children's
ward
he
goes
through
one
of
a
pair
of
doors
the
camera
stops
pans
over
to
buffy
waiting
behind
the
other
door
and
closes
in
on
her
suspicious
face
cut
to
the
children's
ward
dr
backer
comes
in
and
looks
around
at
the
various
beds
as
he
makes
his
way
over
to
a
particularly
sick
child
the
boy
is
asleep
he
checks
his
watch
and
looks
at
the
child
for
a
moment
the
boy
lets
out
a
labored
breath
dr
backer
raises
a
syringe
taps
it
twice
to
get
the
air
bubbles
to
the
top
and
depresses
the
plunger
until
the
fluid
starts
to
squirt
out
he
takes
the
iv
line
and
pushes
the
needle
into
the
drug
administration
stopper
behind
him
he
hears
a
muffled
laugh
and
turns
to
look
but
sees
nothing
he
looks
back
at
the
boy
again
suddenly
he
gets
hit
in
the
back
and
spun
around
by
something
unseen
uhh
he
is
hit
again
in
the
chest
and
yells
out
in
pain
ryan
sees
what's
happening
from
his
bed
and
cowers
in
fear
dr
backer
is
choking
four
slashes
appear
on
his
lab
coat
that
go
deep
and
draw
blood
he
grabs
his
wound
but
is
bent
backward
onto
the
bed
still
being
choked
on
the
wall
a
shadow
can
be
seen
swinging
its
arm
for
another
slice
at
the
doctor
he
screams
and
blood
sprays
onto
the
wall
ryan
cowers
further
under
his
covers
cut
to
the
hall
buffy
slowly
approaches
the
door
to
the
ward
and
looks
in
but
she
quickly
has
to
step
back
and
out
of
the
way
as
dr
backer
comes
flying
out
and
onto
the
floor
he
groans
and
she
bends
down
to
help
him
but
something
pushes
her
away
and
throws
her
back
into
the
wall
she
hits
it
hard
and
slides
down
to
the
floor
unconscious
dr
backer's
arms
are
lifted
by
the
unseen
being
and
his
body
is
pulled
around
and
dragged
down
the
hall
further
down
the
hall
he
is
dragged
around
a
corner
and

on
the

appears
in
the
doorway
and
knocks
buffy
looks
up
as
he
xander
and
the
girls
come
into
the
room
willow
closes
the
door
behind
her
uh
well
it
looks
as
if
you
uh
were
on
to
something
i
know
giles
walks
around
the
bed
the
uh
the
the
girl
tina
um
it's
apparent
that
she
she
died
of
the
fever
giles
sits
simple
enough
but
but
her
records
show
her
improving
and
then
suddenly
deteriorating
www
without
any
apparent
cause
so
we
checked
dr
backer
out
this
guy
was
not
a
solid
citizen
it
wasn't
backer
he
was
clean
what
do
you
mean
'clean'
what
do
you
mean
'was'
he's
dead
this
thing
killed
him
and
not
with
kindness
buffy
hands
giles
the
picture
you
saw
it
giles
looks
at
the
rough
child's
drawing
no
it's
invisible
i
saw
backer
nearly
shredded
and
the
thing
knocked
me
down
but
it's
real
which
means
i
get
to
fight
it
um
giles
takes
off
his
glasses
this
is
your
work
giles
indicates

it
would
help
ifif
we
knew
what
it
was
giles
exhales
iit's
invisible
to
you

the
the
children

but
you
said
you
did
see
something
the
other
night
uh
yeah
but
i
was
pretty
delirious
i

any
sense
why

i
see
it
then
and
not
last
night
the
door
to
the
room
opens
and
buffy's
mother
comes

back
out
of
the
room
cordelia

the
drill

oh

good
at

all
the
time
xander
chuckles

being
literal
xander
gets
a
look
from
cordelia
she
used
to
have
all
these
medical
volumes

didn't
have
the
heart

wrong
willow
to
xander
wrong
why
willow
to
buffy
how
did

cordelia
raises

sits
down
on
the

across
from
the
nurse's
station
cut
to
the
children's
ward
that
evening
ryan
opens
the

and
looks

controlled
dosage
of
the
same
virus
they
already
had
willow
gets
a
confused
look
from
buffy
oh
raising
their
temperatures
to
burn
the
fever
out
of
them

that
work
according

this
it

are
going
through
a
stack
of
books
on

page
and
finds
a
picture
of
a
demon

takes
a
sip
of
his
tea
eww
what
does
this
do
giles
puts
his
mug
down

do
cordelia
pushes
the
book
toward
him
uh
it
uh
extracts
vital
organs
to
replenish
its
own
mutating
cells
wow
cordelia
leans
over
to
look
at
his
book
what
does
this
one
do
cordelia
points
to
a
drawing
giles
looks
up

um
iit
elongates
its
mouth
to
uh
engulf
its
victim's
head
with
its
incisors
ouch

cordelia
points
to
another
giles
frustrated
it
asks
endless
questions
of
those
with
whom
it's
supposed
to
be
working
so
that
nothing
is
getting
done
boy
there's
a
demon
for
everything
he
slaps
down
ryan's
picture

gets
up
from
the
table
in
disgust
he
takes
off
his
glasses
and
rubs
his
forehead
i
don't
even
know
if
we're
on
the
right
track
since
this
uh
miscreant
has

closes
her
book

tricks
on
me
i
mean
i
was
crazed
with
that
fever
who
knows
cut
inside
dr
backer's
refrigerator
the
door
opens
and
the
light
goes
on
buffy
think
about
this
i
have
lots
of
thoughts
buffy
crouches
down
it's
crazy
buffy
searches
the
testtubes
the
fever
that's
how
you
see
the
kindestod
that's
why
celia
could
see
it
that's
why
ryan
still
can
buffy
finds
the
right
one
it's
the
only
way
cut
to
the
office
buffy
stands
back
up
and
faces
willow
but
how
are
you
gonna
fight
this
thing
with
107
degree
temperature
willow
42d
c
i
guess
we'll
find
out
she
uncaps
the
tube
and
raises
it
to
drink
the
serum
willow
quickly
stops
her
buffy
willow
i'm
going
to
do
this
buffy
that's
100
pure
it'll
kill
you
in
an
instant
oh
they
really
should
put
that
on
the
label
willow
reaches
into
the
refrigerator
for
a
bottle
of
drinking
water
and
grabs
a
beaker
that's
sitting
on
top
buffy
closes
the
fridge
while
willow
sets
the
beaker
on
the
desk
and
opens
the
bottle
it
needs
to
be
diluted
she
pours
some
water
into
the
beaker
and
closes
the
bottle
okay
but
this
better
work
fast
willow
takes
the
testtube
and
draws
some
of
the
serum
into
a
dropper
she
holds
it
over
the
beaker
and
lets
a
single
drop
fall
in
faster

up

i
think

in
there
a
form
begins
to
take
shape
as
though
unfolding
it
steps
over

a
bed
and
suddenly
the
kindestod
is
clearly
visible
to
buffy
it
looks
into
a
bed
and
finds
it
empty
she
stares
at
it
through
the
door's
window
the
monster
looks
over
at
another
bed
and
notices
her
staring

straightens
itself
up
and

at

just
giggles
maniacally
and
takes
off
its
hat
to
her

keeps
an
eye
on
her
for
another
moment
as

holding

up
to

buffy
running
down
the
tunnel

to
the
kindestod
still
holding
up

aside
and
he
hits
the
concrete
floor
hard
oof
the
kids
keep
screaming
ryan
tries
to
get
up
the
monster
growls
as
it
slowly
comes
for
him
ryan
turns
around
and
looks
up
at
the
kindestod
he
can't
scream
for
fear
it
kneels
and
leans
over
him
and
now
ryan
starts
to
scream
again
it
takes
his
head
to
hold
him
steady
the
boy
watches
as
the
monster's
eyes
bug
out
and
split
open
they
extend
from
their
sockets
down
toward
his
forehead
the
monster
drools
heavily
and
licks
its
lips
its
eyes
make
contact
with
ryan's
forehead
he
screams
as
he
feels
his
energy
being
drained
suddenly
the
kindestod
gets
hit
in
the
head
with
a
large
section
of
pipe
and
its
eyes
snap
back
into
their
sockets
buffy
stands
over
it
with
the
pipe
held
ready
you
make
me
sick
the
kindestod
stands
up
and
faces
her
she
swings
the
pipe
at
it
again
but
the
monster
blocks
it
and
knocks
it
from
her
grip
although
xander
can't
see
it
he
sees
that
buffy
is
fighting
something
and
takes
the
opportunity
to
go
to
ryan
and
lift
him
up
from
the
floor
up
he
carries
the
boy
over
to
the
other
kids
buffy
is
not
in
top
form
as
she
fights
the
kindestod
and
it
gains
the
upper
hand
and
punches
her
twice
in
the
face
then
throws
her
against
a
pipe
xander
finds
the
other
children
and
starts
to
herd
them
away
c'mon
c'mon
c'mon
hurry
he
follows
them
throwing
a
few
glances
over
at
buffy
along
the
way
she
swings
twice
at
the
monster
but
it
just
leans
back
and
avoids
the
blows
it
grabs
her
again
and
throws
her
into
another
pipe
she
recovers
quickly
spots
a
raised
grating
and
hops
up
onto
it
she
takes
a
good
look
at
the
kindestod
and
then
jumps
from
the
grate
and
lands
a
hard
kick
on
its
face
it
stumbles
back
and
to
its
knee
as
she
lands
on
her
feet
she
kicks
it
three
more
times
while
it
tries
to
get
back
up
xander
comes
back
after
leading
the
kids
away
and
watches
her
fight
he
sees
her
kick
but
to
him
it
looks
like
she's
fighting
thin
air
he
hears
her
get
hit
and
she
spins
around
and
lets
out
a
grunt
of
pain
the
monster
takes
her
by
the
shoulder
and
backhand
punches
her
in
the
face
again
he
takes
her
by
the
throat
lifts
her
up
and
throws
her
into
some
sections
of
large
duct
tube
buffy
is
dazed
and
just

there
on
the
pipe

down
for
its
hat
brushes
it
off
and
puts
it
back
on

from
her
daze

and
reaches
for

holds
her
steady
with
both
hands

eyes
bug
out
and
split
open
again
she
reaches
up
for
its
head
with
both
