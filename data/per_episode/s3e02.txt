prologue

buffy's
room
she
takes
the
last
of
her
things
out
of
her
bag
walks
over
to
her
closet
and
dumps
them
in
she
turns
around
and
looks
at
the
room
that
she's
missed
so
much
for
the
last
few
months
it
all
seems
so
familiar
and
yet
not
certainly
it's
too
neat
and
clean
she
reaches
into
her
closet
for
a
sweater
and
heads
over
to
her
mother's
room
cut
to
joyce's
room
she's
hammering
a
nail
into
the
wall
by
the
window
to
hang
an
ancient
tribal
mask
buffy
steps
into
the
room
mom
joyce
is
very
startled
and
jumps
accidentally
slamming
the
hammer
through
the
drywall
oh
buffy
buffy
cringes
at
the
sight
of
the
hole
in
the
wall
her
mother
pulls
the
hammer
out
and
turns
to
face
her
smiling
while
still
holding
the
hammer
in
one
hand
the
mask
in
the
other
um

worry
about
it
ii

just
got
used
to
all
the
quiet
while
you
were
gone
joyce
smiles
but
it's
no
problem
she
looks
down
at
the
mask
in
her
hand
and
turns
around
to
hang
it
on
the
wall
over
the
hole
it's
carved
from
a
reddish
wood
with
cutouts
for
eyes
which
are
slanted
inward
to
appear
very
evil
there
are
a
series
of
long
pointed
teeth
with
extra
long
fangs
for
incisors
set
into
the
upper
lip
there
is
no
lower
jaw
portion

the
mask
on

a
very
exciting
shipment

around

a
few
pieces

cheers
up
the
room
buffy
looking
at
the
mask
it's
angry
at
the
room
mom
it
wants
the
room
to
suffer
joyce
nods

have
no
appreciation
of
primitive
art
joyce
sees
that
buffy
is
holding
a
sweater

sweater

inhales
deeply

good
time
okay
she
smiles
and
gives
her
mom
a
nervous
little
wave
then
leaves
the
room
cut
to
an
alley
a
truck
drives
by
behind
it
buffy
walks
along
looking
around
she
hears
something
fall
to
the
ground
and
break
and
stops
to
look
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
slowly
she
starts
to
walk
in
that
direction
cut
to
an
intersection
in
the
alley
buffy
comes
around
the
corner
and
looks
down
the
adjoining
way
there
she
sees
a
man
dressed
in
black
walking
suspiciously
as
though
looking
for
something
she
begins
to
follow
silently
but
doesn't
notice
an
empty
aluminum
can
on
the
pavement
and
steps
on
it
the
man
reacts
instantly
to
the
noise
spins
around
and
swings
at
her
with
a
stake
buffy
throws
up
her
arms
and
cross
blocks
the
swing
then
deftly
takes
the
stake
from
the
man's
hands
and
raises
it
to
counter
attack
he
steps
back
and
the
white
cross
hanging
from
his
neck
swings
around
standing
out
in
marked
contrast
to
the
rest
of
his
attire
buffy
sees
that
it's
xander
and
stays
her
attack
xander
is
taken
completely
by
surprise
and
just
stares
back
at
her
buffy
lowers
the
stake
didn't
anyone
ever
warn
you
about
playing
with
pointy
sticks
buffy
shakes
it
at
him
it's
all
fun
and
games
until
somebody
loses
an
eye
you
shouldn't
sneak
up
on
people
like
that
he
breathes
hard
trying
to
catch
his
breath
he
looks
at
her
trying
to
convince
himself
that
it's
really
her
and
finally
manages
a
weak
smile
jeez
buff
suddenly
a
vampire
smashes
his
way
out
of
a
crate
leaning
against
a
wall
he
lunges
at
xander
and
buffy
knocking
them
and
himself
to
the
pavement
xander
quickly
tries
to
grab
the
vampire
as
he
gets
up
but
the
demon
grabs
xander
instead
and
pulls
him
up
he
draws
his
fist
back
for
a
punch
but
buffy
jumps
in
and
hits
the
vampire
in
the
stomach
with
a
powerful
side
kick
making
him
fall
backwards
into
a
pile
of
trashcans
and
bags
cordelia's
voice
comes
over
the
walkietalkie
at
xander's
belt
come
in
nighthawk
everything
okay
buffy
taken
aback
nighthawk
the
vampire
is
back
on
his
feet
and
comes
at
them
ooh
he
tackles
xander
and
sends
him
reeling
backwards
into
a
chain
link
fence
buffy
tries
to
stake
him
but
he
sidesteps
her
and
shoves
her
into
the
fence
as
well
xander
tries
to
come
up
behind
him
but
the
vampire
swings
out
with
a
backhand
fist
to
xander's
face
knocking
him
to
the
ground
buffy
gets
to
her
feet
and
sweep
blocks
two
punches
from
the
demon
she
high
clocks
his
third
punch
and
gets
a
hand
under
his
chin
to
hold
him
at
bay
he
pushes
her
back
into
the
fence
as
the
two
struggle
for
control
now
willow
cordelia
and
oz
come
running
the
two
girls
grab
the
vampire
by
the
arms
and
drag
him
off
of
buffy
and
across
the
alley
slamming
him
hard
into
a
steel
rollup
door
buffy
catches
her
breath
as
she
looks
on
in
astonishment
the
vampire
growls
at
the
girls
as
oz
tries
to
move
in
with
a
stake
but
the
vamp
roundhouse
kicks
oz
sending
him
to
the
pavement
next
to
xander
he
then
shoves
cordelia
away
and
buffy
quickly
moves
to
catch
her
so
she
won't
get
hurt
the
vampire
then
throws
willow
aside
and
she
falls
onto
xander
and
oz
cordelia
recognizes
oh
hey
buffy
buffy
pushes
her
aside
and
wields
back
her
stake
when
she
sees
the
vampire
come
after
them
cordelia
loses
her
balance
and
falls
to
the
pavement
next
to
willow
buffy
plunges
her
stake
cleanly
into
the
vampire
and
he
bursts
into
ashes
as
the
dust
settles
down
she
looks
over
at
her
friends
staring
up
at
her
from
the
ground
they
are
all
breathing
hard
buffy
gives
them
a
little
wave
and
a
weak
smile
hey
guys
they
just
keep
staring
back
xander
lets
his
head
drop
back
to
the
pavement
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

giles'
apartment
building
c
ut
to
outside
his
door
the
kids
are
all
standing
there
you
know
imaybe
it's
too
late
maybe
we
should
just
come
back
tomorrow
no
one
makes
a
move
to
go
buffy
looks
at
the
door
then
back
at
the
others
what
if
he's
mad
mad
just
because
you
ran
away
and
abandoned
your
post
and
your
friends
and
your
mom
and
made
him
lay
awake
every
night
worrying
about
you
xander
to
oz
and
willow
maybe
we
should
wait
out
here
buffy
gives
him
a
look
she
turns
around
to
face
the
door
reaches
for
the
knocker
and
taps
it
a
few
times
cut
inside
giles
opens
the
door
and
sees
buffy
standing
there
flanked
by
the
others
his
face
remains
expressionless
for
a
long
moment
xander
to
giles
check
it
out
the
watcher
is
back
on
the
clock
xander
giles
slips
on
his
glasses
and
just
when
you
were
thinking
career
change
maybe
becoming
a
a
looker
or
a
a
seer
thank
you
xander
he
looks
at
his
slayer
welcome
home
buffy
buffy
smiles
up
at
him
he
pulls
the
door
open
further
and
steps
back
so
they
can
all
come
in
cut
to
giles'
living
room
oz
willow
buffy
and
xander
are
all
on
he
couch
cordelia
is
sitting
in
a
facing
chair
giles
is
leaning
on
the
backrest
of
another
chair
i
got
in
a
few
hours
ago
but
i
wanted
to
go
see
my
mom
first
yes
yes
of
course
how
how
did
you
find
her
well
i
pretty
much
remembered
the
address
ah
eh
i
mean
uh

the
teakettle
in
his
kitchen
begins
to
whistle
how
are
things
between
you
giles
notices
the
whistling
ah
excuse
me
giles
goes
into
the
kitchen
hey
so
you're
not
wanted
for
murder
anymore
good
that
was
such
a
drag
so
where
were
you
did
you
go
to
belgium
buffy
gives
him
an
odd
look
why
would
i
go
to
belgium
i
think
the
relevant
question
is
why
wouldn't
you
xander
smiles
hugely
and
giggles
belgium
they
both
laugh
cut
into
the
kitchen
giles
gets
the
cups
out
of
his
cupboard
he
smiles
as
he
listens
to
the
conversation
in
the
living
room
pleased
that
they
are
getting
along
so
well
again
so
quickly
what
about
you
xander
what's
up
with
you
oh
you
know
same
old
same
old
giles
removes
his
glasses
and
leans
with
his
arm
against
the
cupboard
enjoying
the
sound
of
his
slayer's
voice
again
after
so
many
months
hardly
okay
i
lied
a
whole
lot
is
new
well
that's
good
isn't
it
new
is
good
giles
shakes
himself
out
of
his
reverie
and
puts
his
glasses
back
on
oh
yeah
absolutely
except
for
the
obvious
it's
not
too
much

xander
inaudible
yeah
'cause
you
weren't
at
the
hotel
giles
lifts
up
the
serving
tray
and
takes
it
into
the
living
room
cordelia's
parents
dragged
her
onto
a
luxury
vacation
i
feel
for
you
here
we
are
then
giles
sets
the
tray
on
the
coffee
table
cheer
us
up
he
sits
down
in
his
chair
and
takes
the
teapot
buffy
and
xander
each
take
a
cookie
from
the
tray
so
were
you
like
living
in
a
box
or
what
well
it's
a
long
story
so
skip
the
heartwarming
stuff
about
kindly
old
people
and
saving
the
farm
and
get
right
to
the
dirt
giles
pours
several
cups
perhaps
buffy
could
use
a
little
time
to
adjust
before
we
grill
her
on
her
summer
activities
what
he
said
fair
enough
in
fact
you
can
leave
the
slaying
to
us
while

settle
in
we
got
you
covered
i
noticed
you

the
slayage

out
with
your
walkies
and
everything
yeah
but
the
outfits

maybe
still

dusted
willow
nods
nine
out
of
ten
oz
whispers
to

six

whatever
we
were
kicking
a
little
undead
booty
well

my
normal
routine

jonesing
for
a
little
brainless
fun
buffy
to
xander
what

doing
tomorrow
oh
i
would
but
uh
xander
reaches
his
hands
around
cordelia's
arm
i'm
kind
of
tied
up
smiles
you
wish
cordelia
pushes
him
away
xander
sits
back
into
the
couch
embarrassed
buffy
to
willow
will
um
tomorrow
i
buffy
oh
come
on
friends
don't
let
friends
browse
alone
okay
i
had
some
schoolwork
but
i
can
change
my
plans
giles
raises
his
cup
as
for
school
buffy
uh
you
know
you'll
have
to
talk
to
principal
snyder
before
buffy
on
it
mom
is
making
an
appointment
with
his
ugliness
i
know
she
can
break
him
giles
looks
up
from
his
tea
and
gives
her
an
unsure
little
grin
cut
to
principal
snyder's
office
at
sunnydale
high
snyder
looks
at
joyce
and
buffy
intently
from
behind
his
desk
absolutely
not
under
no
circumstances
but
you
can't
keep
her
out
of
school
you
don't
have
the
right
i
have
not
only
the
right
but
also
a
nearly
physical
sensation
of
pleasure
at
the
thought
of
keeping
her
out
of
school
i'd
describe
myself
as
tingly
buffy
was
cleared
of
all
those
charges
yes
and
while
she
may
live
up
to
the
notamurderer
requirement
for
enrollment
she
is
a
troublemaker
destructive
to
school
property
and
the
occasional
student
and
her
grade
point
average
is
enough
to

snyder
his
eyes
glaze
over
for
an
instant
i'm
sorry
another
tingle
moment
snyder
smiles
smugly
joyce
with
controlled
anger
in
her
voice
i
don't
see
how
you
can
be
so
cavalier
about
a
young
girl's
entire
future
i'm
quite
sure
that
a
girl
with
the
talents
and
abilities
of
buffy
will
land
on
her
feet
in
fact
snyder
leans
toward
buffy
i
noticed
as
i
came
in
this
morning
that
hot
dog
on
a
stick
is
hiring
snyder
buffy
gives
him
an
angry
stare
you
will
look
so
cute
in
that
hat
let's
go
mom
she
gets
up
and
walks
toward
the
door
her
mother
stands
up
and
faces
snyder
this
isn't
over
if
i
have
to
i'll
go
all
the
way
to
the
mayor
joyce

and
kiss

as
she
releases
her
seatbelt
and

of
the
cafe'
buffy
is
standing
and
waiting
for
willow
she
checks
her
watch
and
then
lets
her
arms
droop
disappointed
she
walks
over
to
a
bench
and
sits
down
to
watch
and
wait
for
her
friend
she
watches
all
the
people
going
by
her
expression
starts
to
get
sad
and
a
little
bit
annoyed
as
she
checks
her
watch
again
cut
to
buffy's
house
much
later
she
walks
up
the
path
toward
the
house
the
front

opens
and

sees
a
woman
come
out
and
pull
the
door

grabs
a
stepstool
and
sets
it
down
in
front
of
an
old
bookcase
full
of
stuff
she
steps
up
on
it
and
notices
a
picture
on
an
upper
shelf
she
pulls
it
out
into
the
light
it's
a
photo
of
her
with
willow
and
xander
they
are
on
a
lawn
and
she
is
sitting
with
willow
behind
her
and
xander
laying
his
head
on
her
legs
with
his
eyes
turned
up
at
her
she
looks
at
it
for
a
long
moment
remembering
the
time
it
was
taken
she
then
puts
it
back
and
looks
up
where
the
good
china
is
she
reaches
for
the
box
and
starts
to
pull
it
down
when
a
dead
and
rotting
cat
suddenly
falls
off
of
it
oh
she
jerks
her
head
forward
and
the
cat
falls
behind
her
to
the
floor
she
looks
down
at
it
squeamishly
eww
cut
to
the
backyard
buffy
grunts
as
she
shovels
out
a
bunch
of
dirt
among
some
bushes
to
make
a
shallow
grave
for
the
cat
next
time

and
turns
back
to
the
hole
to
fill
it
back
in
cut
to
buffy's
room
at

that
night
she
reaches
over
to
the
lamp
on
her
nightstand
and
turns
it
off
she
lies
back
in
her
bed
and
hugs
the
covers
to
herself
she
looks
around
in
the
dark
lonely
room
and
waits
to
fall
asleep
cut
to
joyce's
room
she
is
sound
asleep
in
her
bed
the
camera
pans
up
from
her
and
over
to
the
nigerian
mask
on
the
wall
its
eyes
begin
to
glow
a
deep
red
cut
to
the
bushes
in
the
backyard
the
dirt
covering
the
dead
cat
begins
to
move
a
moment
later
the
cat
pokes
its
head
through
the
soil
meows
menacingly
and
claws
its
way
out
once
out
it
continues
hissing
and
growling
as
it
walks
off

sunnydale
high
buffy
walks
into
the
hall
from
outside
the
door
closes
behind
her
with
an
echoing
clang
startling
her
she
looks
back
at
it
but
then
continues
walking
the
school
is
deserted
she
walks
past
the
empty
lounge
toward
the
library
the
doors
are
wide
open
and
she
looks
in
for
a
moment
it's
just
as
deserted
as
the
rest
of
the
school
cut
outside
the
sun
shines
brightly
down
on
the
quad
buffy
slowly
walks
down
the
outside
stairs
all
the
while
looking
around
for
any
indication
that
anyone
else
is
there
when
she
reaches
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
she
turns
out
into
the
quad
she
stops
when
she
sees
angel
coming
toward
her
but
then
keeps
walking
as
he
gets
behind
her
and
follows
her
across
the
quad
i
thought
they'd
be
here
they
are
they're
waiting
for
you
buffy
looks
at
him
am
i
dreaming
angel
smiles
and
chuckles
i'm
probably
the
wrong
person
to
ask
angel
buffy
looks
ahead
again
you'd
better
go
buffy
looks
at
him
i'm
afraid
angel
shrugs
and
looks
at
her
you
should
be
he
stops
walking
and
watches
her
go
the
school
bell
rings
cut
to
buffy's
room
the
school
bell
blends
into
the
sound
of
her
alarm
buzzer
going
off
buffy
wakes
from
her
dream
she
turns
over
and
looks
at
her
alarm
clock
7
am
she
reaches
over
and
turns
it
off
cut
to
the
kitchen
buffy
stares
into
the
refrigerator
while
she
listens
to
her
mother
talking
i've
been
on
the
phone
with
the
uh
superintendent
of
schools
at
least
he
seems
more
reasonable
than
that
nasty
little
horrid
bigoted
rodentman
mom

anyway
um
i'm
going
in
to
speak
with
him
this
afternoon
uh
as
for
private
schools
uh
miss
porter's
accepts
late
admissions
buffy
closes
the
fridge
and
turns
to
give
her
mom
a
look
i
uh
i
wrote
the
information
down
for
you
a
girls'
school
buffy
goes
to
the
island
to
read
the
slip
of
paper

back
at
her
mom

to
throw
in
a
little
footbinding
joyce
sets
down
her
coffee
mug
and
steps
over
to
her
daughter
buffy
you
made
some
bad
choices

just
might
have

with
some
consequences
buffy
looks
down
at
the
island
knowing
that
her
mom
is
right
nothing's
settled
yet
joyce
looks
for
something
to
do
and
spies
the
trash
i
just
wish

didn't
have
to
be
so
secretive
about
things
joyce
ties
off
the
trashbag
i

a
special
circumstance

with
the
trash
couldn't
you

a
few
people
like
principal
snyder
and
maybe
the
police
buffy
looks
at
her
like
she's
got
to
be
kidding

would
be
happy
to
have
a
a
superhero
buffy
can't
believe
her
ears
is
that
the
right
term
i
mean
it's
not
offensive
is
it
she
opens
the
door
to
take
out
the
trash
and
gasps
in
fright
when
she
sees
the
dead
cat
run
in
it
stops
and
meows
at
them
menacingly
cut
to
later
at

opens
it
to
admit
giles
holding
a
cage
welcome
to
the
hellmouth
petting
zoo
she
indicates
upstairs

looks
up
and
starts
to
climb
the
stairs
while
buffy
closes
the
door
behind
him
she
follows
him
up
cut
to
joyce's
bedroom
the
cat
is
hiding
under
the

origins
he
lifts

engrossed
in

up
at
everyone
what
onion
dip
stirring
not

shindig

a
good
spot
whthe

him
in
carrying
parts
of

up
in
the
corner
of
the
living
room
and
are
playing
never

the
camera
pans
from
the
drummer
past
oz
on
his
guitar
and
devon
at
his
mic
into
the
crowd
half
of
sunnydale
high
must
be
in
attendance
the
place
is
so
densely
packed
with
people
the
camera
settles
on
willow
leaning
against
a
table
and
smiling
at
oz
while
moving
to
the
beat
of
the
music
the
camera
turns
back
into
the
crowd
and
follows
a
party
guest
until
she
passes
buffy
buffy
looks
around
at
all
of
the
people
not
sure
who
half
of
them
are
trying
to
find
willow
she
spots
her
and
walks
up
to
her
hey
willow
smiling
hey
willow
listens
to
the
band
you
can
send
me
a
savior
buffy
this
is
large
willow
looks
at
buffy
you
like
that
lives
till
the
end
of
time
buffy
yeah
it's
great
lyrics
looks
back
at
the
band
ii
was
just
sort
of
hoping
it
would
be
us
time
willow
sorry
what
lyrics
indicates
that
it's
too
loud
to
hear
the
promise
of
heaven
buffy
lyrics
louder
this
is
amazing
but
i
was
sort
of
hoping
we
could
just
hang
together
the
gang
but
that
only
leaves
me
dry
willow
indicates
to
the
band
and
makes
like
she
totally
can't
hear
buffy
she
turns
her
attention
back
to
oz
and
smiles
at
him
dry
buffy
senses
that
willow
is
more
into
watching
oz
play
with
the
band
than
anything
else
at
the
moment
and
decides
to
leave
her
alone
too
many
saviors
and
i
won't
die
after
walking
a
ways
back
into
the
crowd
buffy
changes
her
mind
deciding
that
she
wants
to
talk
to
willow
now
i
never
cried
but
i
needed
more
from
you
she
touches
willow
on
the
arm
and
indicates
they
should
go
someplace
to
talk
willow
lets
buffy
lead
her
away
through
the
crowd
i
found
my
life
without
you
now
buffy
finds
a
relatively
quiet
spot
in
the
dining
room
where
they
can
talk
and
i
never
mind
i'm
only
half
as
blind
buffy
is
everything
okay
cause
i
needed
more
from
you
buffy
you
you
seem
to
be
avoiding
me
iin
the
oneonone
sense
willow
looks
surprised
what
and
i
never
mind
willow
this
isn't
avoiding
see
here
you
are
here
i
am
i'm
only
half
as
blind
buffy
so
we're
cool
cause
i
needed
more
from
you
willow
way
that's
why
with
the
party
'cause
we're
all
glad

back
she
isn't
being
very
