episode
begins

loud
rock
music
fade
in
on
a
large
sign
reading
'grand
opening'
with
a
piece
of
paper
stuck
in
between
the
words
reading
're'
as
in
grand
reopening
pan
across
to
a
neon
sign
holding
the
bronze's
new
logo
the
word
bronze
in
pink
in
a
futuristic
script
cut
to
inside
the
bronze
which
has
been
extensively
remodeled
following
its
demolition
by
olaf
in
'triangle'
the
basic
layout
is
the
same
but
the
fixtures
and
furniture
have
a
new
style
less
gothicindustrial
and
more
modern
it
is
filled
with
people
dancing
talking
etc
we
can
see
willowtara
and
xanderanya
dancing
the
group
summercamp
is
onstage
performing
their
song
'play
it
by
ear'
i'm
amused
by
the
overwhelming
choices
i
guess
the
hardest
part
is
knowing
when
to
stop
i'm
confused
and
i
think
i'm
hearing
voices
things
are
happening
so
fast
do
i
save
the
best
for
last
closer
shot
of
xander
and
anya
dancing
pan
across
them
to
willow
and
tara
dancing
all
smiling
pan
over
to
buffy
sitting
by
a
low
round
table
by
herself
watching
the
dancers
looking
pensive
spike
os
bleedin'
crime
is
what
it
is
buffy
looks
up
as
spike
sits
in
the
chair
beside
her
instead
of
his
usual
attire
he
wears
khaki
pants
a
bluegray
buttondown
shirt
open
over
a
black
tshirt
and
a
shiny
brown
leather
jacket
jackin'
up
the
bar
price
to
pay
for
fixin'
up
this
sinkhole
not
my
fault
insurance
doesn't
cover
act
of
troll
gee
maybe
it's
time
you
found
a
new
place
to
patronize
spike
sits
back
i've
half
a
mind
to
especially
since
the
flowering
onion
got
remodeled
off
the
sodding
menu
spike
leans
forward
's
the
only
thing
this
place
had
going
for
it
buffy
frowns
what
are
you
doing
spike
frowns
wha
what
do
you
mean
what
am
i

here
at
this
table
talking
to
me
like
we're
some
kind
of
talking
buddies
well
i
saw
you
sitting
here
alone
thought
i
don't
know
you
could
maybe
do
with
a
bit
of
uh
you
know
company
buffy
raises
her
eyebrows
at
him
spike
frowns
suit
yourself
he
gets
up
focus
on
buffy
looking
back
over
at
the
dance
floor
spike
os
although
he
sits
back
down
as
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
it's
just
we
took
on
that
glory
chippie
together
i
was
right
there
with
you
fightin'
the
fight
actually
you
were
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
knocked
unconscious
still
points
for
intent
spike
buffy
looks
doubtful
you'd
think
that
would
be
enough
to
cut
me
a
sliver
of
slack
earn
a
little
consideration
respect
xander
os
hey
uh
evil
dead
you're
in
my
seat
we
see
xander
and
anya
standing
behind
spike
he
turns
his
head
to
look
at
them
sighs
bugger
it
he
reaches
for
his
beer
bottle
knocks
it
over
accidentally
grabs
it
and
gets
up
buffy
watches
him
go
in
some
confusion
as
xander
and
anya
sit
xander
i
think
you
may
have
hurt
his
feelings
and
you
should
never
hurt
the
feelings
of
a
brutal
killer
xander
ponders
you
know
that's
uh
that's
actually
some
pretty
good
advice
buffy
doesn't
reply
willow
and
tara
come
over
and
sit
so
who's
up
for
some
more
liquid
refreshments

he
has
noticed

cut

a
porter
leans
against
a
fence
reading
a
spiderman
comic
as
a
train
approaches
the
horn
blowing
it
comes
to
a
stop
lingering
shot
of
the
stair
in

straightening
up
waiting
for
the

calls
inside
sunnydale
station
last
stop
this
line
nothing
he
looks
around
the
platform
is
empty
cut
to
the
porter
entering
one
of
the

cars
he
walks
to
the
first
row
of
seats
stops
and
looks
shocked
shot
of
a
male
passenger
lying
slumped
over
with
blood
on
his
neck
and
on
the
pillow
behind
his
head
shot

the

looking
shocked
short
of
a
female
passenger
also
lying
slumped
over
dead
and
bloody
the

walks
farther
into
the
train
and
we
see
more
dead
passengers
in
the
seats
shot
of
another
female
passenger
with
her
arm
stretched
out
into
the
aisle
covered
with

from
a
wound
on

the

breathes
heavily
sound
of
footsteps
he
turns
and
sees
something

he
runs
back
the
way
he
came
cut
to
exterior
shot

the
train's
doorway
the
porter
appears
still
screaming
'help

before
he
can
make
his
way
down
the
stairs
something
grabs
him
from
behind
and
drags
him
back
into
the
train
we
hear
him
screaming
wolf
howl
opening
credits
act
i

open

door
buffy
buffy
enters
i'm
back
by
popular
demand
did
you
have
a
nice
time
buffy
ponders
sits
you
know
i
think
i
did
muchneeded
fun
apart
from
willow's
headaches
and
spike's
cameo
appearance
spike
was
there
unfortunately
joyce
comes
forward
to
sit
beside
buffy
well
i'm
relieved
that
you're
home
because
to
be
honest
i
wasn't
feeling
all
that
safe
with
you
gone
shot
of
giles
sipping
tea
raising
his
eyebrows
in
an
injured
manner
buffy
looks
meaningfully
from
her
mother
to
giles
and
back
joyce
quickly
at
first
and
then
i
um
remembered
that
um
rupert
was
here
and
i
felt
much
much
safer
giles
puts
down
book
gets
up
yes
well
thank
you
for
the
little
backpedal
but
uh
i'm
forced
to
agree
that
i'm
barely
an
adequate
substitute
for
a
slayer
in
the
house
giles
moves
toward
the
door
good
night
good
night
buffy
gets
up
and
follows
giles
to
the
hallway
where
he
begins
putting
on
his
coat
so
how
is
dawn
she's
uh
she's
coping
very
well
extremely
well
really
considering
the
extraordinary
circumstances
of
her
origin
then
lemme
ask
you
something
um
we've
been
going
easy
on
her
the
last
week
letting
things
slide
oh
i
don't
think
that's
at
all
wise
you
don't
no
the
best
thing
you
can
do
now
is
behave
exactly
as
you
always
have
any
special
treatment
at
this
stage
is
likely
to
undermine
dawn's
sense
of
normality
you
think
so
absolutely
buffy
nods
thanks
buffy
turns
around
and
yells
sharply
dawn
dawn
jumps
up
from
the
floor
what
what
did
i
tell
you
about
borrowing
my
clothing
i
didn't
take
your
clothes
bull
i
never
touched
your
stuff
really
then
what
happened
to
my
blue
cashmere
sweater
cut
to
spike
sitting
in
his
crypt
fondling
buffy's
blue
cashmere
sweater
harmony
os
spikey
spike
quickly
hides
the
sweater
behind
him
and
turns
in
his
chair
we
see
harmony
wearing
a
silk
negligee
aren't
you
coming
to
bed
i'm
not
tired
me
neither
she
comes
forward
and
slides
onto
spike's
lap
giving
him
an
excellent
view
of
her
cleavage
he
turns
his
head
aside
looking
annoyed
don't
you
wanna
come
in
and
tire
me
out
harm

spike
she
kisses
his
ear
really
not
in
the
mood
right
now
harmony
annoyed
you're
never
in
the
mood
harmony
kisses
his
ear
again
we
could
do
something
different
tonight
like
what
you
stop
yammering
for
two
seconds
harmony
caressing
his
face
well
we
could
i
don't
know
maybe
play
a
game
spike
looks
at
her
thoughtful
cut
to
harmony
jumping
out
of
the
shadows
wearing
buffy's
blue
sweater
and
a
pair
of
tight
brown
leather
pants
holding
a
stake
she
stalks
dramatically
around
the
crypt
oh
i'm
gonna
stake
you
harmony
looks
around
i'm
coming
after
you
you
bad
evil
vampire
harmony
gestures
with
the
stake
and
i'm
gonna
slay
you
harmony
pauses
and
thinks
for
a
moment
i'm
sneaking
up
and
i'm
going
to
stake
you
so
much
with
my
slaying
powers
that
i
have
because
i'm
the
chosen
she
shrieks
as
spike
shirtless
lunges
into
the
shot
and
grabs
her
around
the
waist
growling
pulling
her
to
the
ground
the
camera
doesn't
follow
them
down
but
remains
focused
on
the
darkened
crypt
harmony
os
oh
spike
cut
to
exterior
uc
sunnydale
building
day
i
just
don't
see
why
he
couldn't
end
up
with
esmerelda
cut
to
inside
tara
buffy
and
willow
are
walking
along
the
hallways
they
could
have
the
wedding
right
there
beneath
the
very
belltower
where
he
labored
thanklessly
for
all
those
years
no
see
it
can't
it
can't
end
like
that
'cause
all
of
quasimodo's
actions
were
selfishly
motivated
he
had
no
moral
compass
no
understanding
of
right
everything
he
did
he
did
out
of
love
for
a
woman
who
would
never
be
able
to
love
him
back
tara
they
come
to
a
vending
machine
and
stop
walking
tara
digs
in
her
purse
willow
looks
in
hers
as
well
also
you
can
tell
it's
not
gonna
have
a
happy
ending
when
the
main
guy's
all
bumpy
willow
takes
some
money
out
of
her
purse
and
hands
it
to
tara
who
smiles
and
turns
to
the
vending
machine
what
did
you
think
buffy
the
test
isn't
till
tomorrow
right
buffy
shrugs
i
don't
have
an
opinion
till
then
but
you
read
it
right
kinda
not
i
rented
the
movie
tara
takes
her
snack
out
of
machine
oh
with
um
with
charles
laughton
i
don't
know
was
he
one
of
the
singing
gargoyles
oh
boy
willow
they
all
begin
to
walk
off
what
i
i'm
kidding
buffy
notices
a
guy
reading
a
newspaper
you're
done
with
this
buffy
grabs
the
paper
from
him
yeah
hi
uh
kind
of
reading
that
buffy
ignores
him
taking
the
paper
over
to
willow
and
tara
staring
at
the
front
page
shot
of
front
page
of
the
sunnydale
press
reading
'metrotrain
murder
six
found
murdered
on
train
at
sunnydale
station'
'six

tara
glory
buffy
shakes
her
head
'unconfirmed
reports
of
severe
trauma
to
the
throats
of
one
or
more
of
the
victims'
buffy
lowers
the
paper
survey
says
vampire
cut
to
spike
climbing
up
some
stairs
emerging
in
his
crypt
a
woman
is
watching
him
we
only
see
her
from
the
back
spike
reaches
the
top
of
the
stairs
sees
her
and
gasps
in
surprise
oh
it's
you
spike
frowns
what
are
you
doing
here
lurking
about
he
bends
over
to
slide
a
trapdoor
cover
over
the
hole
in
the
floor
that
he
just
emerged
from
we
see
the
visitor
is
dawn
i'm
not
lurking

looking
what
are
you

that
how

the
daytime

the
sewers
or
something

pauses
sighs

buffy
know
you're
here
spike
takes
out
a
cigarette
lights
it
yeah
right
dawn
turns
and
walks
a
little
bit
away
'cause
nothing
would
make
her
happier
than
to
find
out
i'm
hanging
out
after
school
in
the
vampire's
lair
especially
yours
spike
snaps
off
his
lighter
in
annoyance
go
home
then
i
don't
feel
like
it
right
now
well
you
can't
bloody
well
stay
here
why
not
because
i've
got
things
to
do
dawn
folds
her
arms
over
her
chest
looking
skeptical
spike
approaches
her
bad
evil
things
spike
dawn
tries
to
stifle
a
grin
that
are
not
for
a
child's
eyes
dawn
stops
smiling
i'm
not
a
child
dawn
goes
to
lean
against
a
pillar
i'm
not
even
human
not
originally
spike
sighs
yeah
well
originally
i
was
i
got
over
it
spike
sits
on
the
edge
of
a
coffin
doesn't
seem
to
me
it
matters
very
much
how
you
start
out
that's
smart
i
get
that
dawn
pauses
i
like
how
you
talk
to
me
like
i
can
understand
things
everyone
else
is
being
all
twitchy
and
secretive
they're
just
trying
to
keep
you
safe
i
expect
i
feel
safe
with
you
spike
chokes
on
his
cigarette
smoke
in
horror
he
begins
to
cough
and
jumps
down
from
the
casket
dawn
moves
forward
from
the
pillar
in
alarm
take
that
back
dawn
quickly
i
i
mean
you
have
that
whole
superpower
thing
and
you're
just
as
tough
as
buffy
is
maybe
tougher
dawn
quieter
buffy
thinks
so
too
she
does
well
she's
always
worried
about
what
she's
gonna
do
if
you
ever
get
that
chip
out
of
your
head
is
that
right
so
um
spike
he
sits
back
down
on
the
coffin
and
dawn
leans
back
against
the
pillar
what
else
does
buffy
say
about
me
cut
to
buffy
entering
the
summers
house

holding
an
armful
of
books

tiny
noise
coming
from

little
sigh
spike
looks
at
dawn
so
i
listened
harder

very
very
quiet

word
suddenly
there's
a
loud
noise
of
the
crypt
door
banging
open
dawn
jumps
with
a
very
startled
gasp
spike
starts
too
looks
over

shoulder
at
the
door
oh

hell
buffy
comes
rushing
in
spike

short
when
she
sees

here
buffy
spike
gets
down
from
the
coffin
spike
was
just
telling
a
story
aand
he
was
just
at
this
really
cool
part
buffy
dawn
to
spike
what
the
hell
is
this
what
is
she
doing
here
just
hanging
out
buffy
raises
eyebrows
here
can
you
please
let
him
finish
the
story
then
you
could
do
the
lecture
buffy
scowls
looks
over
at
spike
yeah

let's
hear
the
story
that
spike
is
telling
my
little
sister
spike
nervous
right
yeah
spike
shot
of
the
two
girls
watching
dawn
interested
buffy
with
her
arms
folded
so
uh
i
knew
the
girl
was
in
the
coal
bin
so
i
rip
it
open
very
violent
haul
her
out
of
there

spike
looks
at
buffy
and
then
i
give
her
to
a
good
family
in
a
nice
home
spike
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
where
they're
never
ever
mean
to
her
and
didn't
lock
her
in
the
coal
bin
what
that's
so
lame
spike
to
buffy
i
was
just
about
to
send
her
home
i
knew
you'd
be
frettin'
dawn
get
your
stuff
we're
getting
out
of
here
spike
watches
them
leave
frowning
cut
to
buffy
and
dawn
walking
through
the
graveyard
why
doesn't
that
register
with
you
crypt
plus
vampire
equals
bad
'cause
it
was
spike
hanging
out
with
spike
is
not
cool
dawn
okay
it
is
it
is
dangerous
and
icky
dawn
pauses
smiles
bashfully
i
don't
think
spike's
icky
yeah
well
think
again
sister
buffy
sees
dawn's
expression
and
stops
dawn
tries
to
hide
her
face
buffy
folds
her
arms
across
her
chest
you
have
a
crush
on
him
no
i
don't
it's
just
dawn
giggles
he's
got
cool
hair
and
he
wears
cool
leather
coats
and
stuff
dawn
stops
smiling
and
he
doesn't
treat
me
like
an
alien
he's
a
killer
dawn
you
cannot
have
a
crush
on
something
that
is
dead
and
and
evil
and
a
vampire
right
that's
why
you
were
never
with
angel
for
three
years
buffy
quietly
angel's
different
he
has
a
soul
spike
has
a
chip
same
diff
buffy
turns
away
gesturing
angrily
i
i
can't
listen
to
this
buffy
sighs
turns
back
spike
is
a
monster
okay
aand
plus
you
are
only
fourteen
years
old
i
like
hanging
out
with
him
is
all
and
even
if
i
did
have
a
crush
he
wouldn't
notice
in
a
million
years
not
with
you
around
what
does
that
mean
spike's
totally
into
you
buffy
is
speechless
oh
come
on
you
didn't
notice
buffy
spike
is
completely
in
love
with
you
buffy
stares
at
her
huh
blackout
act
ii

fade
in
on
a
piece
of
yellow
police
tape
crime
scene
do
not
cross
stretched
across
the
doorway
of
the
train
a
hand
rips
it
down
pan
over
to
buffy
and
xander
standing
on
the
platform
buffy
has
the
yellow
tape
in
her
hand
xander
is
holding
a
flashlight
so
tell
me
again
what
we're
looking
for
clues
she
goes
into
the
train
oooohkay
he
follows
cut
to
inside
the
train
tape
on
the
seats
marks
where
the
victims
were
found
buffy
and
xander
enter
look
around
could
you
give
me
a
clue
about
what
kind
of
clues
something
anything
buffy
looks
around
just
wanna
know
this
was
a
vamp
attack
if
it
was
how
many
we're
talking
about
xander
shines
his
flashlight
around
well
sunnydale's
finest
didn't
leave
us
a
lot
of
stuff
to
examine
who
knows
how
many
people
have
traipsed
through
here
buffy
is
thinking
about
something
else
xander
what
buffy
starts
to
speak
stops
never
mind
they
each
turn
to
look
at
a
different
part
of
the
train
car
then
buffy
turns
back
iit's
just
that
dawn
said
that
yeah
forget
it
buffy
xander
walks
toward
her
she
thinks
that
she
said
that

buffy
xander
nods
waits
for
it
spike's
in
love
with
me
xander
frowns
for
a
second
then
bursts
out
laughing
i'm
not
joking
xander
still
laughing
oh
i
hope
not
it's
funnier
if
it's
true
i'm
serious
xander
this
is
serious
he
stops
laughing
with
an
effort
puts
up
a
hand
to
show
willing
xander
seriously
all
right
xander
clears
throat
after
a
moment
he
snickers
and
begins
laughing
again
buffy
pouts
sits
down
on
a
seat
right
inside
the
tape
outline
of
a
corpse
it's
creepy
no
not
creepy
'cause
it's
not
real
i
mean
how
upset
can
you
really
get
over
one
of
spike's
fevered
daydreams
that's
not
gonna
happen
i
guess
so
where
did
dawn
how
did
she
come
to
this
extremely
entertaining
conclusion
buffy
gets
up
she
was
hanging
out
with
spike
i
think
she
has
a
crush
on
him
she
walks
past
xander
who
turns
to
watch
her
in
dismay
what
i
mean
i
always
knew
that
he
had
this
weird
fixation
with
me
i'm
the
one
she
has
a
crush
on
me
buffy
shakes
head
there's
nothing
here
let's
go
buffy
turns
to
leave
it's
always
been
me
big
funny
xander
oh
what
she
just
suddenly
decides
i'm
not
the
cool
one
any
more
why
is
that
okay
xander
follows
buffy
out
the
camera
pans
up
to
the
cargo
compartment
in
the
ceiling
of
the
train
car
we
see
an
antique
doll
lying
on
its
side
with
a
red
blindfold
tied
around
its
eyes
cut
to
buffy
entering
her
home
walking
down
the
hall
toward
the
kitchen
joyce
os
but
what
they
didn't
get
was
that
it
was
a
copy
of
the
bill
of
lading
pan
down
the
hallway
we
see
joyce
leaning
on
the
kitchen
island
as
the
camera
moves
closer
we
see
dawn
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
listening
and
smiling
so
they
thought
that
it
was
another
order
form
so
now
i've
got
two
shipments
of
greek
amphorae
on
my
hands
the
camera
pans
further
and
we
see
spike
sitting
on
the
counter
behind
dawn
all
three
laugh
at
the
conclusion
of
joyce's
story
that's
funny
and
really
how
many
do
you
need
amphorae
they
all
laugh
more
buffy
enters
folding
her
arms
over
her
chest
joyce
sees
her
joyce
giggling

by
to
apologize
for
yesterday
joyce
puts
her
hands
over
dawn's

a
while

buffy
sitting
in
a
car
watching

looks
at
buffy
she
gives
him
a
sharp
look
back

looks
away
buffy
frowns
at
him
looking
very
suspicious
and
nervous
spike
suddenly
reaches
toward
her
and
buffy
flinches
back
in
her
seat
hey

opens
the
glove
compartment
and
takes
out
a
flask
buffy
looks
relieved

takes
a
swig
and
then
offers
her
the
flask
ew

he
shakes
his
head
reaches
across
buffy
to
put
the
flask
back

back
and
sighs
he
begins
to
hum
tapping
his
fingers
on
the
steering
wheel
buffy
gives
him
a
look
which
he
doesn't
notice
spike

this
for
the
money

spike
shh
they
both
look
out
the
front
window
two
figures
walk
across
the
street
closer
shot
of
the
two
male
vamps
going
up
to
a
door
opening
it
and
entering
the
warehouse
spike
and
buffy
get
out

embarrassed
for

the
vamps'
furniture

in
a
cozy
grouping
spike
comes
forward
goes
a
few
steps
in
the
direction
the
vampires
went
the
popcorn
disappears
at
this
point
so

gone
far
buffy
is
still
staring
at
the
furniture
and
stuff

buffy
she
opens
the
door
and
exits
spike
watches
her
go
cut
to
spike
entering
his
crypt
moving
slowly
it's
dark
he
walks
in
makes
a
face
and
puts
his
hand
to
his
face
suddenly
there's
a
sniffling
noise
spike
looks
up
looks
around
suspiciously
who's
there
a
voice
comes
from
the
shadows
behind
him
he
turns
a
happy
memory
pretty
spike
drusilla
walks
out
from
the
shadows
holding
a
red
rose
look
who's
come
to
make
everything
right
again
spike
stares
at
her
astonished
she
puts
the
rosebud
against
her
cheek
and
draws
it
down
across
her
face
blackout

working
on
turning
angel
into
his

bad
self
again
mmhmm

like
lollipops
at
the
circus
although

for
angelus
setting

drusilla
she
touches
her

the
whole
la

spike
sits
in

'can't'
in
an
imitation
of
spike
being
zapped
by
the
chip
you've

a
chip
she
tries
to
put
her
hands
on
spike's
head
but
he
gets
up
from
the
chair
and
moves
away
right

spike's
become
a
cautionary
tale
for
vampires
right
'you
better
be
good
kiddies
or
else
they
might

harmony
turns

he
grabs
her
by
the
throat
spike
looking
at
dru
it's
been
fun
while
it
lasted
harm
spike
dru
smiles
but
i
think
it'd
be
best
now
if
you
hit
the
road
he
throws
harmony
across
the
room
she
hits
the
wall
and
slides
down
to
the
floor
clutching
her
throat
and
panting
why
because
she's
back
spike
still
looking
at
dru
no
spike
moves
closer
to
dru
because
i
am
dru
smiles
harmony
begins
to
get
to
her
feet
spike
puts
his
arm
around
dru's
waist
and
pulls
her
up
against
him
and
there
you
are
my
darling
deadly

puts
her

on
the
back
of
his

and
they

cut

joyce
buffy
and
willow
sitting
in
the

well
he
he

he
said
'i

you'
well
ii
didn't
let
him
get
that
far
but
i
could
see
the
words
coming
honey
did
you
somehow
unintentionally
lead
him
on
in
any
way
uh
send
him
signals
buffy
ponders
well
i
i
do
beat
him
up

joyce

up
buffy

i
he

really
as
long
as
it's
still
chips
ahoy
in
spike's
head
he
can't
hurt
me
or
any
of
us
you

besides
this'll
probably
just
blow
over
you
know
it's
just
some
weird
spike
thing
he'll
have
the
hots
for
some
gak
demon
before
we

and
spike
i

he's
pretty
twisted

clear
right
that
it
could
never
happen
that
there's
no
possible
way
ever

at
them
i
i
think

buffy
you
have
to
talk
to
him
again
what
no

no
no
i
have
to
avoid
him
again
not
until
you
shut
him
down
completely
if
he
thinks
there's
even
a
little
chance
with
you
there's
no
telling
what
he'll
do
buffy

concerned

slightly
she
delivered

a
hundred
years
she
never

caresses
drusilla's
cheek
ad

into
his

me
to

depths
i

dru
smiles
just
to

such
a
black
beauty
shot
of

face
as
she
smiles

lifts
the
stake
again
and
puts
it
firmly
against
dru's
chest
she
gasps
and
winces
ow

his
hand
down

why

some
tiny
feeling
for

intensely
at

he
moves
right
up
close
to
her
spike
he
looks
hopeful
the
only
chance
you

with

was
unconscious
spike
puzzled
oh

spike
makes
a
face
of
extreme
frustration

butt
because

somewhere

it's
me
walking
away
from
you

buffy
shrine
bringing

mannequin
and
all
the
pictures
crashing
down
buffy
turns
and
walks
off

up
covered
in
buffy
pictures
and
sighs

to
buffy
walking
quickly
down
the
street
near
her
home
spike
runs
up
behind
her
buffy
come
on
now
stop
he
reaches
her
and
begins
walking
by
her
side
you
can't
just
walk
away
from
this
what
part
of
punching
you
in
the
face
do
you
not
understand
so
we
had
a
fight
it's
not
our
first
love
and
it
doesn't
change
anything
buffy
stops
walking
turns
to
him
angrily
it
changes
everything
spike
i
want
you
out
i
want
you
out
of
this
town
i
want
you
off
this
planet

my
friends
or
my
family

walks
off

his
head
and
follows
no

not
that
easy
we
have
something
buffy
spike
buffy
is
walking
up
the
stairs
to
the
front
door
of
her
house
spike
follows
it's
not
pretty
but
it's
real
and
there's
nothing
either
one
of
us
can
do
about
it
buffy
opens
the
door
and
enters
turning
to
face
spike
who
is
right
on
her
heels
like
it
or
not
i'm
in
your
life
you
can't
just
shut
me
out
he
stops
suddenly
at
the
doorway
as
an
invisible
force
prevents
him
from
entering
buffy
stands
right
inside
the
door
giving
him
a
grim
look
spike
stares
in
surprise
gives
a
tentative
smile
not
quite
getting
it
yet
it
begins
to
dawn
on
him
that
his
invitation
to
the
summers
house
has
been
revoked
buffy
steps
back
and
closes
the
door
in
his
face
blackout
joss
