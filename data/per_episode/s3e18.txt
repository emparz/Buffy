knocking

of
the

set
she
rolls
to
her
feet

turns
to
her
roundhouse

the
face
and
it
drops
she
pulls
out
a
knife
you
demons
can't
resist
a

at
one
of
the
creatures
and

opening

high
on
a
school
day
morning
cut
to
willow
and
buffy
walking
into
the
library
so
scabby
demon
got
away
scabby
demon
number
two
got
away
scabby
demon
number
one
big
check
in
the
slay
column
i
don't
like
this
whole
no
mouth
thing
it's
disquieting
well
no
mouth
means
no
teeth
unless
they
have
them
somewhere
else
they
sit
down
at
the
main
table
where
xander
and
oz
already
are
giles
comes
out
of
his
office
nearby
here
we
go
we've
been
researching
the
uh
mayor's
forthcoming
ascension
it's
pretty
riveting
stuff
what
do
we
know
what
don't
we
know
tell
her
giles
based
upon
the
supposed
date
graduation
day
and
the
mayor
being
impervious
to
harm
i've
crossreferenced
xander
he's
a
crossreferencing
fool
and
i've
eliminated
several
possibilities
it's
not
the
ritual
flaying
of
the
demon
azarath
nor
the
uh
i
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
that
was
kind
of
an
anticlimax
we
don't
know
anything
the
whole
fake
angel
thing
was
for
nothing
no
no
no
if
nothing
else
angel's
charade
has
brought
faith's
treachery
to
the
open
and
this
information
on
the
ascension
will
prove
useful
eventually
i
just
need
to
put
it
together
we
see
buffy
scratching
at
her
hand
as
wesley
enters
looking
dapper
as
ever
terribly
sorry
i
was
detained
official
counsel
business
mr
giles
you
were
speaking
i
was
just
filling
buffy
in
on
my
progress
regarding
the
research
on
the
ascension
oh
and
what
took
up
the
rest
of
the
minute
touch√©
of
course
my
work
is
un
official
i'm
sure
however
with
the
resources
of
the
council
at
your
disposal
you
will
have
something
to
add
well
i
am
pleased
to
state
with
certainty
that
the
demon
azarath
will
not
in
any
way
be
involved
the
whole
gang
minus
giles
gets
up
and
heads
out
of
the
library
leaving
wesley
standing
at
the
head
of
the
table
i'm
sure
we'll
find
out
more
soon
demon
azarath
cut
to
buffy
and
willow
in
the
school
hallway
at
willow's
locker
so
have
you
talked
to

bad
and
with
faith
he
only
kissed
her
for
the
greater
good
i
don't
know
to
the
naked
eye
it
looked
like
fun
or
maybe
it
wasn't
maybe
he
wasn't
even
tempted
i
just
wish
i
could
be
sure
as
always
i
advise
you
to
ask

tell
me

everybody

buffy
buffy
scratches
her
hand
again
cut
to
the
library
office
with
giles
giles
has
his
nose
buried
in
a
tome
you
touched
one
of
the
demons
buffy
examines
her
hand
under
a
magnifying
lamp
a
good
touch
not
a
bad
touch
anyway
it's
been
itching
like
crazy
buffy
she
switches
off
the
lamp
and
swings
it
aside
no
big
just
another
problem
for
the
good
people
at
lubriderm
right
giles
finds
a
picture
of
the
demon
he
set
the
book
down
in
front
of
buffy
that's
the
demon
in
question
in
the
disgusting
flesh
hmm
he
picks
the
book
back
up
and
steps
away
from
her
reading
it
what
it
says
they
can
infect
the
host
infect
infect
giles
is
still
reading
giles
infect
oh
um
infect
the
host
with
an
aspect
of
the
demon
that's
all
it
says
an
aspect
of
the
demon
buffy
grabs
the
book
from
him
looks
at
it
intently
it's
rather
terse
isn't
it
you
mean
like
a
part
of
it
there
could
be
any
number
of
explanations
for
your
hand
a
new
fabric
softener
can
cause
irritation
in
any
case
i
would
advise
not
to
attempt
to
track
the
one
that
got
away
let's
minimize
your
exposure
part
of
the
demon
i
hope
it's
not
the
outside
part
cut
to
the
outside
quad
cordy
and
some
other
cheerleaders
are
leading
a
rally
for
the
basketball
team
the
gang
is
sitting
on
a
bench
off
to
the
side
h
o
g
a
n
it's
hogan
goooo
hogan
everyone
claps
and
cheers
as
hogan
steps
out
is
it
me
or
is
this
really
lame
i
don't
know
i
usually
enjoy
lameness
and
this
is
leaving
me
kinda
cold
willow
reading
the
school
newspaper
well
according
to
freddy's
latest
editorial
'the
pep
rally
is
a
place
for
pseudoprostitutes
to
provoke
men
into
a
sexual
frenzy
which
when
thwarted
results
in
pointless
athletic
competition'
xander
and
the
downside
being
the
school
paper
is
edging
on
depressing
lately
you
guys
notice
that
i
don't
know
i
always
go
straight
to
the
obits
willow
notices
buffy
running
her
hands
over
her
hair
what
are
you
doing
buffy
nothing
checking
for
horns
buffy
hops
off
the
bench
away
from
them
willow
quickly
goes
after
her
and
they
stop
to
talk
a
short
distance
away
from
oz
and
xander
who
still
watch
the
rally
ah
you
know
buffy
i
don't
even
think
giles
is
right
about
you
becoming
like
a
demon
i
mean
he's
totally
burnt
you
know
dealing
with
faith
and
this
ascension
thing
between
you
and
me
he's
not
doing
his
best
work
what
if
he
is
right
i'm
suddenly
going
to
grow
this
demon
part
and
we
don't
even
know
what
it
is
it
could
be
claws
or
scales
willow's
expression
turns
shocked
what
was
it
a
boy
demon
cut
to
cheerleaders
t
o
m
it's
tom
goooo
tom
cut
to
oz
and
xander
on
the
bench

good
their
spelling's
improved
you
know
oz
i
look
at
all
this
beauty
all
these
healthy
young
woman
and
i
wonder
why
i
ever
wasted
my
time
on
cordelia
i
mean

at
her
she's
no
better
looking
than
the
rest
of
them
none
of
them
are
really
my
oh
my
god
he's
looking
at
her
xander
sees
wesley
a
distance
away
on
the
stairs
staring
at
cordelia
in
awe
he's
got
his
filthy
adult
pierce
brosny
eyes
all
over
my
cordy
wesley
shakes
his
head
and
continues
up
the
stairs
you're
a
very
complex
man
aren't
you
back
to
will
and
buffy
it's
just
i'm
scared
will
there's
this
thing
in
me
and
i
can't
find
it
i
can't
stop
it
what
if
it
changes
me
not
just
the
way
i

of
a
sudden

not
me
anymore

but
i'm
sure
you're
gonna
be
okay
dissolve
to
buffy
walking
down
the
sidewalk
at
night
she
stops
and
pulls
out
her
compact
mirror
takes
a
look
still
gotta
mouth
she
turns
and
is
startled
by
angel
standing
right
behind
her
sorry

okay
i
didn't
see
you
so
i
should
have
known
you
were
there
what
are
you

here
it's
a
dangerous
time
you
know
with
faith
yeahfaith
shewell
faith

about
her
they
walk
together
i
just
wanna
make
sure

stops
and
faces
him
and

fact
that

me
safe
by
tracking

bothering
you
a
lot
of
things
they
start
walking
again
the
most
recent
being
this
demon
actually
two
i
touched
one
of
them
and
now
i'm
gonna
get
a
big
case
of
the
bumpies
or
a
tail
or
something
an
aspect
of
the
demon
you
know
the
drill
by
rumor
that
doesn't
mean
anything
i
mean
sometimes
demons
they
just
exagerate
their
power
demon
hype
maybe
not
i
spend
all
my
time
in
the
dark
here
anyway
it's
not
like
i'd
be
at
a
gain
you
know
with
my
friends
where
someone
could
see
me
and
my
new
monster
part
angel
grabs
her
arm
and
pulls
her
around
to
face
him
hey
i
won't
let
anything
happen
to
you
if
i
can
help
it
no
matter
what
i'll
always
be
with
you
hey
i'll
love
you
even
if
you're
covered
with
slime
i
liked
everything
until
that
part
cut
to
the
school
the
next
morning
willow
oz
and
xander
are
excitedly
entering
the
lounge
area
could
you
believe
it
right
at
the
buzzer
three
points
for
the
win
they
all
sit
down
it
was
intense
yeah
for
a
minute
there
i
thought
you're
gonna
make
an
expression
well
i
felt
one
coming
on
i
won't
lie
man
i've
never
seen
anyone
jump
like
hogan
martin
they
should
call
him
the
jumper
or
a
name
that
isn't
an
article
of
women's
clothing
hey
remember
when
willow
shhh
xander
shuts
up
as
buffy
approaches
the
group
hmmm
quietness
we
either
lost
or
we
won
and
you
don't
want
me
to
feel
bad
well
yeah
it
wasn't
a
really
good
game
yeah
tall
hoops
with
thin
tall
guys
what's
the
point
cordelia
walks
up
to
get
something
off
a
table
nearby
pretty
dull
are
you
guys
crazy
that
was
an
incredible
game
i've
never
cheered
so
hard
in
my
life
i
still
have
knee
marks
on
my
back
cordelia
off
their
looks
from
the
pyramid
yeah
well
i
still
bet
patrolling
was
way
better
cause
wow
important
well
i
thought
i
saw
a
four
legged
demon
but
it
was
just
a
dog
a
weredog
regular
xander
tough
luck
xander
looks
at
cordy
talking
with
her
friends
i
wonder
if
she
and
wesley
have
kissed
it
really
bugs
you
huh
what
cordelia
and
wesley
smooching
man
you
read
my
mind
slow
zoom
in
on
buffy
as
she
realizes
what
just
happened
act
two

buffy
walks
down
the
school
hallway
in
her
own
world
she
bumps
into
a
teacher
ooo
whoa
there
you
watch
where
you're
going
now
i'm
sorry
mr
beech
i
will
mr
beech
vo
as
he
walks
away
students
if
we
could
just
get
rid
of
all
the
students
buffy
continues
down
the
hall
students
thoughts
assail
her
when
i'm
a
sophomore
jillionaire
and
you're
all
flipping
burgers
who's
the
loser
then
'maybe
i'll
take
french
i
said
how
hard
can
it
be
french
babies
learn
it'
idiot
i
swear
someday
my
pants
are
gonna
fall
right
off
buffy
is
so
beautiful
she
stops
gives
a
furtive
glance
at
the
guy
i
mean
look
at
that
body
she
raises
her
arm
to
shield
a
blush
god
i
would
love
to
shove
her
against
that
locker
right
now
and
just
oooh
she
mentally
freaks
and
hurries
past
she
almost
bumps
into
another
guy
who
looks
at
her
we
don't
hear
his
thought
but
she
breaks
into
a
run
cut
to
buffy
talking
to
giles
in
the
library
is
this
the
thing
the
aspect
thing
because
i
gotta
say
if
it
is
it
is
way
better
than
a
tail
i
mean
i
have
a
hard
enough
time
finding
jeans
that
fit
right
buffy
slow
down
i'm
not
even
convinced
that
this
is
genuine
mind
reading
you're
most
likely
projecting
your
buffy
when
i
walked
in
a
few
minutes
ago
you
thought
'look
at
her
shoes
if
a
fashion
magazine
told
her
to
she'd
wear
cats
strapped
to
her
feet
ium
the
demons
are
telepathic
i
should
have
known
that's
why
they
didn't
need
mouths
of
course
demons
are
telepathic
i
know
you
just
told
me
that's
why
they
don't
need
mouths
and
you
should
have
known
this
is
astounding
it
was
happening
out
in
the
hallway
principal
snyder
has
walk
like
an
egyption
stuck
in
his
head
and
the
boys
at
this
school
are
seriously
disturbed
it's
wierd
but
giles
think
about
it
think
about
what
i
could
do
it
could
be
very
useful
you
could
anticipate
your
opponent's
every
move
turn
his
plans
against
him
oh
way
better
than
that
cut
to
buffy
in
literature
class
jealousy
willow
is
seated
to
her
right
with
xander
behind
her
nancy
annoying
missknowitall
is
to
buffy's
left
the
teacher
walks
around
the
room
buffy
right
very
good
i
knew
that
jealousy
clearly
is
the
tool
that
iago
uses
to
undo
othello
but
what's
his
motivation
what
reason
does
iago
give
for
destroying
his
superior
officer
cassio
has
my
place
twix
my
sheets
he's
done
my
office
well
he
was
passed
over
for
promotion
cassio
was
picked
instead
and
people
were
saying
that
othello
slept
with
his
wife
buffy
did
the
reading
buffy
understood
the
reading
when
did
she
study
was
i
supposed
to
study
ms
murray's
kinda
hot
i
was
gonna
say
cassio
uh
i
hate
her
any
other
reason
nancy
blurting
out
race
uh
good
nancy
can't
overlook
that
boy
sitting
at
willow's
right
is
freddy
look
at
them
scrambling
for
the
teacher's
praise
like
pigeons
for
thrown
bread
crust
buffy
turns
buffy
whispering
will
who's
that
guy
that's
freddy
iverson
he
writes
those
editorials
for
the
school
paper
he's
sardonic
bread
crusts
that's
deep
i
should
write
that
down
buffy
turns
and
looks
back
at
the
teacher
now
at
the
front
of
the
room
there's
something
else
at
work
here
well
he
um
he
sort
of
admits
himself
that
his
motive
are
spurious
he
um
he
does
things
because
he
he
enjoys
them
it's
like
he's
not
he's
not
really
a
person
he's
a
the
dark
half
of
othello
himself
huh
woah
the
teacher
steps
out
from
behind
her
desk
and
approaches
buffy
buffy
really
very
astute
i
said
something
quite
like
that
in
my
dissertation
i
know
uh
i
mean
i
agree
with
that
yes
and
doesn't
that
also
explain
othello's
readiness
to
believe
iago
within
seconds
he
turns
on
desdomona
camera
moves
in
on
buffy
as
the
teacher
speaks
he
believes
that
she's
been
unfaithful
and
we're
all
like
that
we
all
have
our
little
internal
iagos
that
tell
us
our
husbands
or
our
girlfriends
or
whatever
don't
really
love
us
but
you
never
really
see
what's
in
someone's
heart
the
classroom
scene
fades
to
angel
walking
toward
his
draped
over
doorway
buffy
opens
the
drapes
angel
brings
up
his
arm
shielding
himself
from
the
daylight
oooh
sorry
sorry
about
the
daytime
i
just
ducked
out
of
school
and
that's
when
they
have
it
they
head
into
the
main
room
umyou
look
good
i
mean
i
i
know
i
saw
you
last
night
but
sometimes
things
can
change
really
quick
they
sit
down
on
the
couch
i
mean
really
quick
listen
to
me
i'm
talking
like
faith
his
eyes
snap
to
hers
then
he
looks
down
again
you
know
not
that
she
was
so
bad
to
have
around
you
know
before
the
evil
you
know
i
think
she
was
hurting
a
lot
and
some
people
protective
type
people
might
be
drawn
to
that
i
guess
well
the
thing
about
faith
you
can't
get
into
my
mind
how
did
youwhy
not
it's
like
the
mirror
the
thoughts
are
there
but
they
create
no
reflection
in
you
you
got
the
aspect
of
the
demon
yeah
giles
doesn't
know
how
long
it's
gonna
last
it's
ok
a
little
headachy
but
you
don't
have
to
play
games
with
me
buffy
ever
well
you're
not
exactly
joehere's
whati'mthinking
so
ask
me
oh
but
that
woulda
made
sense
what
do
you
wanna
know
about
faith
how
i
felt
kissing
her
pretending
to
have
no
soul
watching
you
suffer
well
since
you
bring
it
up
i
hated
hurting
you
more
than
i
could
stand
look
the
thing
about
faith
i'd
understand
you
know
she
has
you
know
that
whole
bad
girl
thing
working
for
her
kissing
her
meant
nothing
i
don't
want
a
bad
girl
i've
done
that
before
i've
lived
a
long
time
buffy
and
i'm
past
that
i've
been
with
dozens
of
girls
like
her
more
oh
this
honesty
stuff
is
funnn
i
mean
there's
no
comparison
in
twohundredfortythree
years
i've
loved
exactly
one
person
ohhit
is
me
right
next
time
just
ask
ok
and
buffy
be
careful
with
this
gift
a
lot
of
things
that
seem
strong
and
good
and
powerful
they
can
be
painful
like
say
immortality
exactly
i'm
dying
to
get
rid
of
that
funny
i'm
a
funny
guy
cut
to
the
library
where
willow
oz
xander
cordelia
buffy
giles
and
wesley
are
gathered
around
the
table
she
can
read
our
minds
our
every
impulse
and
fantasy
every
one
oh
god
i
don't
see
what
this
has
to
do
with
me
i
don't
see

to
do
with
me

something

but
this
is
important
talk

use
the
sample
questions
they
look
over
the

eyes
them
today
people
the
three
go

exit
the

oh
write
neatly

will
in
the
library
interrogating
jonathan
fantasy's

uh
i
guess
we
all
have
fantasies
that
we're
powerful
more
respected
where
people
pay
attention
to
us
uh
maybe
but
sometimes
the
fantasy
isn't
enough
is
it
jonathan
sometimes
we
have
to
make
it
so
people
don't
ignore
us
make
them
pay
attention
you

talking
about
don't

how
much
of
a
strain
does
it
put
on
you
to
maintain
it
uh

that
a
good
answer
i
want
to
get
this
right

buffy
closes
the
window
and
climbs
into

the
thoughts
blend
into
one
long
rambling
incoherent
stream
our
heroine
curls
up
under
the
covers
and
presses
a
pillow
to
her
head
cut
to
giles
and
wesley
putting
in
late
night
research
at
the

wesley
is
mixing

seems
to
be
coming
along
all
right
yes
buffy's
being
driven
mad
we
have
no
proof
that
this
is
going
to
work
and
it
still
requires
the
heart
of
the
second
demon
which
we
have
no
idea
how
to
get
without
the
slayer
negative
thinking
doesn't
solve
problems
who
is
going
to
get
the
demon
heart
giles

himself
burke

throw
a
punch

it
dodges
the

punches
angel
angel
shrugs
it
off
returns
a

a
solid
punch
that
backflips
it
off
the

ends
up
twisting
the
demon's
arm
and
throwing
it

comes
in
to
continue
but
the

good
of
you
to
check
on
him
well
it's
nice
to
be
able
to
help
someone
in

nonslaying
capacity
except
he's
starting
to
get
that
look
you
know
like
he's
gonna
ask
me
to
prom
well
it
would
probably
be
good
for
his
selfesteem
if
you
oh

what
am
i
saint
buffy

three
feet
tall
