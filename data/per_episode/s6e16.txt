of
buffy's
and
willow's
faces
in
a
room
staring
at
something
offscreen
outside
the
window
lightning
flashes
and
thunder
rumbles
willow
horrified
buffy
it's
hideous
oh
my
god
buffy
look
at
its
arms
buffy
nods
bravely
i
know
but
it's
my
duty
cut
to
a
longer
shot
we
see
both
buffy
and
willow
reflected
in
the
fulllength
mirror
in
buffy's
bedroom
they
both
wear
extremely
ugly
dresses
of
some
shiny
teal
fabric
buffy's
dress
has
short
sleeves
and
willow's
has
elbowlength
sleeves
there
are
ruffles
on
all
the
sleeves
and
on
the
skirts
from
knee
to
floor
each
dress
also
has
a
large
green
flower
over
the
heart
buffy's
hair
is
up
in
a
bun
and
a
large
white
flower
is
attached
to
one
side
of
her
head

dutyschmuty

supposed
to
be
best
man
shouldn't
i
be
all
marlene
dietrichy
in
a
dashing
tuxedo
number
no
oh
willow
pouts
that
would
be
totally
unfair
we
must
share
equally
in
the
cosmic
joke
that
is
bridesmaidsdom
buffy
groans
and
sits
down
on
the
bed
willow
whining
well
maybe
if
i
ask
anya
i
can
still
go
with
the
traditional
blood
larva
and
burlap
willow
buffy
putting
on
earrings
i
mean
she
was
a
a
vengeance
demon
for
like
a
thousand
years
she
would
know
all
the
most
flattering
larvae
willow
makes
a
face
what
was
she
thinking
i
think
she's
probably
too
stressed
to
be
thinking
right
now
what
with
xander's
relatives
and
her
demons
oh
my
god
last
night
that
rehearsal
dinner
that
was
like
a
a
zoo
without
the
table
manners
and
i
bet
it
got
worse
after
we
left
i
just
can't
believe
everyone
bought
that
story
about
anya's
people
being
circus
folk
did
you
see
the
guy
with
the
tentacles
what's
he
supposed
to

bat
mitzvah

mr

a
sympathetic
face
anya
appears
in
the
doorway
wearing
a
bathrobe
she
sees
the
other
two
gasps
and
puts
her
hands
to
her
mouth
oh
buffy
and
willow
exchange
a
look
unsure
whether
anya
is
delighted
or
horrified
ohh
anya
sighs

so
beautiful
she
walks
over
and
hugs
them

time

happiest

of
my
whole

tara
and

'i'll

anya

like
it
anya
turns
back
to
them
nervously
oh

these
ridiculous
traditions

his
arm
around
the
caterer's
shoulders
so
she
is
forced
to
turn
with
him
uncle
rory
noticing
something
oh
bad
head
what
we
see
a
large
bison
head
mounted
on
the
wall
it
wears
a
bridal
veil
well
the
lip
wasn't
split
right
uncle
rory
lets
her
go
walks
over
to
the
head
you
see
what
you
gotta
do
is
you
gotta
grab
the
lip
between
your
thumb
and
your
finger
and
then
you
have
to
slice
right
through
the
center
of
the
meat
he
makes
demonstrating
gestures
the
caterer
nods
politely
then
he
puts
his
arm
around
her
again
it
was
my
trade
uncle
rory
leading
her
away
i
used
to
stuff
things

through
the
crowd
a

at

to
the
front

just
as
d'hoffryn
enters
carrying
a
bright
orange
box
with
a
purple
bow

gives

a
strong
purple
light
suddenly
the
light
shoots
in
a
beam
from
the
orb
onto

to
morph
into
the
beam
of
light

swings
the
frying
pan
toward
her
face
we
flash
back
to
the
present
the
purple
light
clears
away
from
xander's
face
shot
of
the
orb
in
the
old
man's
hands
the
light
goes
back
into
it
and
it
stops
glowing
xander
is
panting
looks
shocked
i'm
so
sorry

old
man
xander
still
looking
shellshocked
but
you
can
change
things
it
doesn't
have
to
go
like
this
but
you
can't
marry
anya
but
old
man
you'll
hurt
her
less
today
than

later
believe
me
sometimes
two
people
all
they
bring
each
other
is
pain
xander
stares
at
him
horrified
cut
to
the
lobby
buffy
walks
by
most
of
the
guests
have
taken
their
seats
in
the
main
room
there
are
short
white
pedestals
holding
vases
of
flowers
at
the
entrance
to
the
aisle
buffy
walks
along
the
corridor
pauses
as
she
spots
something
up
ahead
reveal
spike
leaning
against
a
wall
his
skanky
date
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
he
looks
up
notices
buffy
looks
down
at
the
floor
buffy
looks
nervous
steels
herself
and
walks
over
to
him
spike
quietly
hello
buffy
hey
it's
a
happy
occasion
you
meet
my
friend
no
not
yet
but
she
seems
like
a
very
nice
attempt
at
making
me
jealous
spike
small
smile
is
it
working
buffy
quietly
a
little
it
doesn't
change
anything
but
if
you're
wildly
curious
yeah
it
hurts
spike
softly
i'm
sorry
spike
remembers
himself
or
good
buffy
smiles
a
little
you
want
us
to
go
no
no
i
you
have
every
right
to
be
here

pretty
much
deserve
spike

buffy
sighs
looks
at
the
ceiling
god

is
hard

back
shot
of
the
main
room
as
the
brawling
guests
begin
to
notice
the
fight
in
the
hallway
and
turn
to
look
anya
runs
over
to
xander
i'm
so

so
glad

was
all
lies
what
he
showed
you
it
wasn't
true
he
just
wanted
to
break
us
up
buffy
is
still
fighting
the
demon
it
grabs
her
by
the
shoulders
but
she
breaks
free
and
punches
it
in
the
gut
it
doesn't
matter
now
so
we'll
be
okay
xander
still
looks
upset
watching
buffy
and
the
demon
fight
buffy
kicks
the
demon
making
it
fall
to
its
knees
she
grabs
its
head
and
slams
it
on
the
floor
the
demon
lies
there
groaning
buffy
rushes
over
to
xander
and
anya
pushes
between
them
excuse
me
she
grabs
the
veil
off
of
the
mounted
bison
head
runs
back
over
as
the
demon
is
starting
to
get
up
she
wraps
the
veil
around
its
neck
and
pulls
the
demon
struggles
gagging
suddenly
a
white
pedestal
hits
the
demon
in
the
face
he
falls
down
unconscious
we
see
it
was
xander
wielding
the
pillar
angle
on
xander
and
buffy
looking
down
at
the
demon
xander
lifts
the
pedestal
again
and
slams
it
down
onto
the
demon
camera
angle
stays
on
their
faces
the
whole
time
it's
dead

whole
crowd
of
demons
and
harrises
bursts
into
cheers
and
applause

gives
a
little
smile
xander

looks
at

looking
in
shock

xander
looks
over
at
the
main
room
shot
of
xander's
parents
yelling
at
each
other
mr
harris
is
standing
while
mrs
harris
sits
in
a
chair
shot
of
xander
watching
closer
shot
of
xander's
dad
yelling
angrily
pan
down
to
xander's
mom
arguing
back
at
him
it
looks
like
he
tries
to
hit
her
and
she
grabs
his
hand
cut
back
to
xander
still
watching
them
xander
tearful
we
can't
start
over
if
this
is
a
mistake
it's
forever
and
i
don't
want
to
hurt

close
shot
on
their
hands
separating
falling
to
their
sides
i'm
sorry
xander
anya
crying
i
am
so
sorry
anya
sniffles
wipes
her
eyes
with
her
hand
continues
crying
slowly
in
a
daze
she
turns
and
walks
away
xander
watches
her
go
then
he
turns
and
walks
outside
looks
like
it
has
stopped
raining
and
is
sunny
anya
walks
to
the
beginning
of
the
aisle
still
holding
her
bouquet
the
cuts
on
her
arm
are
a
little
bloody
but
not
serious
the
string
quartet
begins
to
play
the
wedding
march
the
guests
all
rise
anya
starts
to
walk
down
the
aisle
still
looking
dazed
her
face
streaked
with
tears
the
guests
stare
in
dismay
she
stops
at
the
other
end
of
the
aisle
and
just
stands
there
cut
to
close
shot
of
a
coffeetable
with
a
mug
on
it
a
hand
reaches
out
and
picks
it
up
dawn
os
should
we
do
something
for
her
we
see
dawn
holding
the
mug
she's
in
the
summers
living
room
on
the
armchair
anything
we
see
buffy
sitting
on
the
sofa
looking
sad
willow
os
she
wants
to
be
alone
that's
what
she
wants
we
see
willow
sitting
beside
buffy
holding
another
mug
willow
softly
oh
god
it
just
hurts
my
heart
to
think
of
her
buffy
softly
i
know
the
whole
thing
hurts
my
heart
dawn
softly
i
thought
they
were
happy
they
were
i
know
they
were
they
were
supposed
to
be
my
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
i
guess
they
were
a
train
why
did
this
happen
i
don't
know
i
feel
like
i
should
be
hating
xander
but
i
can't
willow
sighs
i
just
i
just
hope
he's
okay
i
wonder
where
he
is
cut
to
hallway
of
a
crappy
motel
the
manager
opens
a
door
marked
7
revealing
a
crappy
little
room
he
walks
in
followed
by
xander
still
wearing
his
tux
the
manager
hands
xander
the
key
not
much
to
explain
air
conditioner's
busted
xander
looks
around
blankly
that's
it
checkout's
at
eleven
the
manager
exits
closing
the
door
behind
him
leaving
xander
just
standing
there
blankly
fade
to
close
shot
on
anya's
face
still
tearstreaked
still
wearing
her
wedding
gown
but
not
the
veil
around
her
it's
all
black
as
in
a
featureless
demon
realm
a
hand
comes
into
shot
holding
a
handkerchief
in
front
of
anya
she
takes
it
but
doesn't
look
up
pull
out
to
reveal
d'hoffryn
circling
around
behind
her
are
you
okay
anya
shakes
her
head
i'm
tired
anya
sniffles
of
crying
anya
teary
i'm
just
so
tired
d'hoffryn
d'hoffryn
sighs
oh
anyanka
i'm
sorry
d'hoffryn
pause
but
you
let
him
domesticate
you
when
you
were
a
vengeance
demon
you
were
powerful
at
the
top
of
your
game
you
crushed
men
like
him
anya
doesn't
react
it's
time
you
got
back
to
what
you
do
best
don't
you
think
anya
finally
lifts
her
face
up
to
look
at
him
her
expression
is
blank
blackout
joss
whedon
and
marti
noxon
