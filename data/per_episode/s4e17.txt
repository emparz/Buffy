prologue

night
a
park
like
graveyard
buffy
rolls
backward
she
is
on
her
feet
to
meet
a
snarling
bald
vampire
that
leaps
and
spins
and
kicks
at
buffy's
head
then
it
kicks
her
in
the
stomach
driving
her
back
it
snarls
and
rushes
her
and
she
punches
it
rapidly
perhaps
five
times
the
vampire
spins
and
backhands
buffy
knocking
her
down
it
rushes
her
and
she
kicks
with
both
legs
knocking
it
back
xander
anya
the
bald
vampire
rolls
over
backwards
willow
from
the
bushes
cries
a
warning
buffy
another
one
a
second
vampire
a
darkhaired
one
snarls
and
grabs
at
the
still
prone
buffy
and
she
flips
it
over
as
the
bald
vampire
comes
to
its
feet
xander
grabs
it
from
behind
by
the
jacket
and
anya
tries
to
hold
it
from
the
front
buffy
kicks
the
darkhaired
vampire
in
the
face
and
he
gets
up
and
runs
away
buffy
willow
flips
buffy
who
has
gotten
up
a
stake
buffy
catches
it
it
is
unclear
whether
xander
and
anya
release
the
vampire
they
are
struggling
with
or
if
it
breaks
free
regardless
it
moves
toward
buffy
and
she
stakes
it
but
flinches
as
she
does
so
the
staking
seems
awkward
where's
the
other
one
xander
pointing
scampered
like
a
big
bunny
anya
also
pointing
in
there
the
four
of
them
run
in
the
same
direction
as
the
vampire
did
cut
to
interior
of
a
large
crypt
five
vampires
are
feeding
off
of
a
single
victim
sucking
sounds
are
heard
buffy
holding
a
stake
looks
back
worriedly
at
xander
willow
and
anya
they
have
stopped
descending
a
staircase
and
are
looking
at
the
vampires
cut
to
exterior
the
scoobies
exit
from
the
crypt
looking
depressed
i
don't
care
if
it
is
an
orgy
of
death
there's
still
such
a
thing
as
a
napkin
a
nest
no
biggie
i
bet
i
could
do
it
i
know
could
take
at
least
two
yes
and
we
could
run
for
help
while
the
other
three
suck
your
heart
out
through
your
neck
you're
right
it's
too
many
for
just
us
you
know
who
we
need
cut
to
exterior
view
of
mansion
cut
to
overhead
view
in
a
large
room
buffy
and
the
scoobies
walk
slowly
as
supplicants
towards
a
desk
uh
hi
we
have
a
problem
the
chair
behind
the
desk
spins
around
to
reveal
the
short
stocky
jonathan
dressed
very
sharply
in
a
black
turtleneck
a
guitar
makes
a
bondlike
twang
jonathan
is
smiling
and
exuding
confidence
sounds
like
you
could
use
my
help
a
trumpet
blares
playfully
act
1

the
interior
of
giles'
apartment
huff
buffy
is
practicing
her
forms
she
does
a
sequence
of
punches
giles
is
reading
a
book
anya
is
working
on
opening
a
milk
carton
jonathan
is
holding
a
pistol
crossbow
and
checking
it
out
willow
is
working
on
a
laptop
computer
xander
is
walking
toward
anya
he
stops
he
practices
drawing
at
stake
and
making
a
stabbing
motion
with
it
as
he
does
it
he
makes
whooshing
sounds
sshh
sssh
quick
draws
about
more
than
speed
it's
also
about
pointing
a
stake
the
right
way
xander
quick
draws
again
sshh
sssh
and
there
can
be
splinter
issues
it
is
a
true
test
of
dexterity
anya
extends
the
quart
sized
milk
carton
anya
to
xander
can
you
open
this
no
i
tear
it
and
it
gets
all
sloshy
xander
quick
draws
again
sshh
sssh
thanks
for
doing
this
jonathan
ii
wouldn't
ask
but
hey
don't
worry
about
it
nest
full
of
vampires
you
come
get
me
ok
box
full
of
puppies
that's
more
of
a
judgement
call
buffy
laughs
with
him
hit
me
buffy
attacks
and
jonathan
blocks
one
or
two
of
her
punches
and
stops
short
of
landing
a
counter
punch
you
got
me
it
was
very
punchy
watch
out
for
southpaws
buff
don't
let
'em
surprise
you
giles
looks
up
from
his
book
haven't
found
a
reference
to
any
uh
rituals
seems
more
like
aa
family
meal
if
you
will
and
they
say
no
one
eats
without
the
tv
on
anymore
thanks
rupert
jonathan
puts
his
hand
on
giles'
shoulder
well
it's
good
to
know
we're
not
walking
into
the
unholy
feast
of
something
or
other
jonathan
removes
hand
oh
jonathan
i'm
in
jonathan
walks
over
to
willow
schematics
for
the
crypt
part
of
the
original
plan
for
the
cemetery
sometime
there's
a
oh
no
back
way
in
just
the
one
entrance
buffy
rapidly
well
maybe
we
could
make
it
work
for
us
we
could
stake
out
the
entrance
you
know
uh
maybe
use
a
decoy
buffy
faster
still
lure
them
out
or
i
bet
jonathan
reaches
to
the
computer
there
we
can
get
in
that
way
buffy
is
upset
willow
is
impressed
oh
of
course
why
didn't
i
think
of
that
i'm
sure
you
would
have
willow
smiles
and
coos
ooh
i
think
we
have
a
plan
jonathan
hands
xander
a
crossbow
and
flips
anya
a
stake
buffy
jonathan
flips
buffy
a
stake
you
go
in
first
let
'em
get
a
look
at
the
slayer
xander
jonathan
looks
at
chessboard
the
nimzowitsch
defense
let's
see
if
i
remember
jonathan
moves
piece
hmmmmmm
mate
in
four
you
almost
got
me
that
time
rupert
giles
is
disbelieving
xander
willow
and
anya
you
back
up
buffy
i'll
be
the
surprise
guest
everyone
lets
show
these
fiends
that
they
came
to
the
wrong
town
cut
to
interior
of
crypt
a
vampire
rises
from
feeding
and
looks
a
twanging
and
whoosh
is
heard
and
an
arrow
thunks
into
it's
chest
and
it
turns
to
dust
three
more
vampires
rise
together
and
see
buffy
anya
xander
and
willow
a
figure
crashes
through
the
skylight
jonathan
lands
and
fires
his
minicrossbow
hitting
another
vampire
in
the
chest
argh
the
last
three
vampires
charge
one
is
grabbed
by
the
scoobies
jonathan
fires
again
a
thunk
is
heard
buffy
stakes
a
vampire
vampire
the
remaining
vampire
breaks
free
from
the
scoobies
and
slaps
the
stake
out
of
buffy's
hand
and
rushes
past
her
buffy
he's
getting
away
jonathan
does
a
flip
then
aims
and
fires
buffy
turns
to
see
the
last
vampire
get
hit
and
turn
to
dust
i
should
have
gotten
that
one
you
got
two
of
them
and
that
second
one
was
ready
for
you
jonathan
smiles
you
should
feel
pretty
good
buffy
distressed
but
i
let
one
get
by
me
don't
worry
you
know
it
only
matters
that
you
do
your
best
jonathan
walks
past
her
but
that's
just
it
cut
to
the
outside
i
don't
think
it
was
my
best
cacophony
of
five
or
more
photographers
swarm
hey
jonathan
over
here
photographer
takes
a
shot
quick
photo
please
another
one
right
here
ok
guys
that's
enough
i
think
we
did
great
we
knocked
em
dead
which
they
already
were
we
knocked
'em
deader
they
weren't
very
well
organized
if
they
had
all
rushed
at
buffy
they
could
have
killed
her
right
away
thanks
anya
that
won't
keep
me
awake
all
night
vampires
only
form
nests
to
make
hunting
easier
they're
not
big
on
the
cooperation
they
mostly
like
to
hang
out
all
creepy
and
alone
in
the
shadows
don't
you
agree
jonathan
turning
head
spike
sinister
guitar
music
plays
spike
steps
out
from
behind
a
bush
well
well
the
man
himself
what
are
you
doing
here
jonathan
and
spike
circle
each
other
slowly
the
sinister
guitar
music
resumes
and
continues
i
live
here
i
wasn't
exactly
pining
for
a
noisy
visit
from
'wonder
jonathan
and
his
fluffy
battle
kittens'
yeah
you
think
that
one
up
with
all
the
time
you
spend
not
being
able
to
bite
people
careful
he's
still
pretty
dangerous
yeah
back
off
'betty'
buffy
it's
buffy
you
big
bleached
music
ends
stupid
guy
spike
you're
the
worst
type
of
scum
the
second
you're
back
to
your
old
tricks
well
let's
just
say
before
you
even
sniff
out
your
first
victim
you'll
be
pretty
indistinguishable
from
oh
what
should
we
say
instant
soup
mix
one
last
chord
of
sinister
guitar
music
cut
to
tara's
room
willow
and
tara
are
sitting
next
thing
i
know
this
crazed
vamp
is
like
running
right
at
me
and
i
know
if
it
gets
past
me
there's
no
telling
who's
in
danger
next
come
on
you
have
fun
admit
it
living
the
scooby
life
i
was
going
for
a
kind
of
stoic
bravery
but
yeah
and
it
was
exciting
with
the
ceiling
coming
in
and
everything
willow
puts
tape
on
a
small
piece
of
paper
willow
sticks
the
paper
on
something
oh
that's
a
cute
one
aand
buffy
she
was
ok
oh
she
was
great
twang
poof
tara
looks
confused
that
was
the
sound
the
crossbow
vampire
dusting
i
mean
she
was
a
little
cranky
that
she
missed
that
one
vamp
wwell
ii
kind
of
meant
personally
tara
sticks
something
on
the
wall
that
whole
thing
with
faith
it
pretty
much
freaked
me
out
and
i
was
just
sensing
it
from
a
distance
oh
yeah
i
know
she's
not
over
the
whole
riley
sleeping
with
faith
thing
oh
you
know
i
mean
faith's
insides
and
buffy's
outsides
when
her
insides
were
out
the
camera
angle
changes
to
reveal
they
are
working
on
a
large
montage
of
jonathan
photos
on
the
wall
i
hope
they'll
be
ok
i
sure
it'll
blow
over
they're
probably
all
with
the
smoochies
right
now
cut
to
riley's
room
riley
is
picking
up
a
toy
basketball
he
has
one
in
each
hand
buffy
sitting
on
bed
you
must
be
feeling
better
riley
tosses
the
toy
ball
through
a
hoop
underneath
the
hoop
is
a
poster
of
jonathan
in
a
basketball
outfit
riley
catches
the
ball
as
it
bounces
back
to
him
yeah
yeah
i'm
a
lot
stronger
i'm
no
jonathan
but
i'm
doing
ok
are
you
i
mean
you're
not
what
eating
the
initiatives'
technicolor
food
of
strongness
no
uh
uh
they
uh
they
swear
they've
stopping
treating
the
food
but
i'm
not
taking
the
chance
you
know
i
uh
i
don't
know
if
that
means
i'll
get
weaker
or
dumber
or
smarter
they're
not
big
with
the
disclosure
huh
they
still
haven't
released
a
full
profile
on
adam
and
we're
having
zero
luck
tracking
him
i
just
if
they'd
just
put
a
little
trust
in
me
i
know
i
could
get
the
job
done
i've
felt
that
way
my
entire
life
riley
sits
beside
buffy
uneasy
buffy
stands
she
misses
a
basket
you'd
think
i
could
do
that
guess
it
takes
different
muscles
than
demon
beheading
you
just
need
a
few
pointers
riley
stands
and
moves
behind
buffy
she
becomes
uneasy
again
now
if
slaying
was
a
competitive
sport
then
i'd
have
a
chance
you
know
we
could
have
figure
staking
and
speed
staking
i
buffy
becomes
more
uneasy
and
turns
bumping
the
still
injured
riley
ahhh
sorry
i
this
just
isn't
my
game
i
gotta
buffy
leaves
cut
to
a
coffee
shop
buffy
is
pouring
cream
in
a
huge
cup
of
coffee
it's
all
faith's
fault
she's
like
poison
no
worse
she's
like
acid
that
eats
through
everything
buffy
switches
to
pouring
sugar
maybe
she's
a
bomb
buffy
stirs
the
point
is
everything
was
going
along
great
with
riley
and
then
she
comes
along
and
messes
everything
up
buffy
hands
the
cup
of
coffee
to
jonathan
jonathan
is
dressed
in
a
very
dapper
suit
with
a
lime
green
shirt
and
a
handkerchief
in
his
breast
pocket
that
matches
his
tie
buffy
you
know
what
i
think
i
don't
think
this
about
you
being
angry
with
faith
i
think
you're
angry
with
riley
hi
could
you
please
jonathan
accepts
a
pen
and
a
notepad
from
a
blonde
girl
who
can't
stop
grinning
sure
jonathan
signs
an
autograph
i
mean
you
have
this
amazing
connection
with
him
he
hands
the
autograph
back
to
the
girl
thank
you
and
then
at
the
one
moment
when
it
matters
the
most
he
looks
into
your
eyes
and
he
doesn't
even
see
that
it's
not
you
looking
back
at
him
there's
no
way
he
could
know
i
mean
you
don't
just
look
at
someone
and
say
'hey
that's
not
your
body
get
out
of
that
body
with
your
hands
up'
buffy
gestures
with
her
hands
up
i
know
you
know
that
but
you
have
to
believe
it
buffy
if
there's
any
part
of
you
that's
blaming
riley
for
what
happened
it
seems
like
there's
a
part
of
you
that
needs
to
forgive
him
you're
jonathan
levinson
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
my
name
is
karen

i
think

picture
of

the
back
cover

my
book

a
k

a
moment

a
k
will
lend
you
a
book
and
it's
pretty
heavy
heh
he
sips

coffee
maybe
i
have
been
blaming
him
but
how
do
i
get
past
it
hmmph
what
if
it's
too
late
what
if
after
all
this
he
doesn't
want
me
anymore
he
does
it's
not
going
to
be
easy
buffy
but
you
guys
are
very
special
together
that's
worth
a
little
hard
work
he
stands
and
walks
away
buffy
stands
reaches
into
her
pocket
and
leaves
some
money
on
the
table
but
i'm
not
even
sure
if
i
know
how
to
talk
to
him
anymore
how
do
i
make
it
ok
again
if
you
really
want
it
the
camera
angle
on
jonathan
changes
so
a
billboard
of
jonathan
hawking
tennis
shoes
is
visible
'light
as
a
feather'
is
the
slogan
you
can
make
anything
happen
cut
to
the
initiative
a
man
in
a
full
dress
uniform
is
addressing
slightly
more
than
a
dozen
military
members
of
the
initiative
before
a
table
not
all
of
the
military
can
be
next
to
the
table
for
those
of
you
who
don't
already
know
my
name
is
colonel
george
haviland
i'm
commanding
officer
here
until
such
time
as
the
facility
review
is
completed
this
review
does
not
mean
our
primary
mission
is
changed
in
any
way
recovery
of
the
hostile
known
as
adam
is
our
first
and
most
important
job
to
this
end
i've
asked
our
tactical
consultant
here
to
address
us
today
mr
levinson
jonathan
steps
up
previously
hidden
by
much
taller
members
of
the
initiative
thank
you
colonel
graham
aside
to
riley
it's
about
time
we
brought
out
the
big
guns
jonathan
unfolds
a
schematic
of
a
skeletal
structure
and
spreads
it
on
the
table
men
before
we
can
locate
adam
we
need
to
understand
him
better
and
there's
something
that's
bothered
me
almost
from
the
start
he
doesn't
eat
we've
known
him
to
kill
but
never
to
eat
the
kill
so
i've
pulled
some
of
professor
walsh's
original
design
schematics
and
i've
found
something
his
power
source
is
not
biological
at
all
it's
here
jonathan
points
to
center
of
chest
in
the
skeletal
schematic
the
design
attempts
to
hide
it
but
i
believe
that
there's
a
small
reservoir
of
uranium
235
sir
how
long
will
it
last
essentially
forever
it
also
means
that
cutting
off
his
head
is
useless
killing
adam
means
annihilating
him
completely
but
first
we

spying
on
jonathan's
mansion
looking
in
his
windows
where
are
you
jonathan
are
you
like
never
home
her
view
goes
dark
and
she
lowers
the
binoculars
to
see
a
growling
monster
coming
toward
her
with
an
arm
raised
to
strike
she
screams
the
monster
is
tan
with
very
long
arms
and
clawlike
hands

is
bald
and
has
fangs
and
a
mark
on
its
forehead

the
monster
also
has
a
brown
mane
down
its
back
karen
screams
the
monster
knock
her
down
with
a
swipe
it
holds
her
with
one
paw
or
hand
and
swings
at
her
with
the
other
she
swings
at
the
monster
and
hits
it
with
her
binoculars
knocking
it
down
she
runs
off
the
monster
jumps
up
chittering
and
snarling
she
drops
her
binoculars
as
she
runs
splashing
through
the
wet
grass
cut
to
the
initiative
jonathan
and
riley
talking
she's
ready
to
forget
it
you
better
be
ready
too
jonathon
ties
a
black
cloth
around
his
neck
i
don't

jonathan
i
mean
i
don't
know
if
she'll
really
ever
forget
it
every
time
i
try
to
touch
her
she's
scared
scared
of
me
scared
of
what
you're
thinking
about
what
do
you

knows
that
faith
is
experienced
jonathon
pushes
a
clip
into
the
pistol
and
cocks
it
what
are

she
think
that
what
that
i'd
be
comparing

that
i
think
i
haven't

she
has
to
know
jonathan
people

always
see
what's
right
in
front
of
them
jonathan
has
blindfolded
himself
and
he
aims
the
pistol
toward
three
members
of
the
initiative
who
have
apples
on
their
heads
trumpet
music
plays
the
music
continues
as
the
scene
changes
cut
to
the
bronze
witch
doctor
stirred
it
up
for
me
i
took
sips
from
your
sweet
lips

into
a
fistfight

buffy
looks
at
riley
the
song
ends
the
audience
applauds
jonathan
dressed
in
a
white
jacketed
tuxedo
comes
to
the
microphone
good
evening
everyone
i'd
to
dedicate
this
to
some
friends
of
mine
a
very
special
couple
who've
been
going
through
a
tough
time
some
of
the
audience
coos
jonathan
sings
when
i
hear
that
serenade
in
blue
i'm
somewhere
in
another
world
alone
with
you
riley
stands
and
extends
his
hand
to
buffy
jonathan
sings
sharing
all
the
joys
we
used
to
know
many
moons
ago
buffy
takes
riley's
hand
and
they
move
to
the
dance
floor
jonathan
sings
once
again
your
face
comes
back
to
me
they
start
to
dance
buffy
puts
her
head
on
riley's
shoulder
and
puts
her
hand
on
his
back
holding
him
a
little
tighter
jonathan
sings
just
like
the
theme
of
some
forgotten
melody
in
the
album
of
my
memory
tara
and
willow
smile
enjoying
the
song
jonathan
sings
serenade
in
blue
the
melody
becomes
more
uptempo
jonathan
sings
seems
like
only
yesterday
a
small
café
a
crowded
floor
again
buffy
hugs
riley
jonathan
sings
and
as
we
danced
the
night
away
i
hear
you
say
forever
more
and
then
the
song
became
a
sigh
anya
cuddles
and
caresses
xander
while
looking
at
the
stage
jonathan
sings
forever
more
became
goodbye
but
you
remain
in
my
heart
the
melody
resumes
its
original
tempo
jonathan
sings
tell
me
darling
is
there
still
a
spot
singing
continues
in
the
background
buffy
i
want
you
to
know
do
we
have
to
have
the
talk
no
talk
more
dance
i
just
want
to
say
i'm
sorry
that
it's
only
you
that
i
want
i
know
i
know
all
of
that
you
do
buffy
nods
since
when
since
you
put
your
arms
around
me
the
song
ends
applause
is
heard
jonathan
blows
a
trumpet
oh
my
god
he's
going
to
do
something
off
the
new
album
xander
she
is
staring
raptly
at
jonathan
yeah
let's
go
have
sex
now
cut
to
xander
who
is
also
staring
raptly
at
jonathan
yeah
ok
they
walk
off
holding
hands
neither
taking
their
eyes
from
jonathan
until
the
last
possible
moment
karen
rushes
in
and
buffy
takes
her
arm
oh
what
is
it
are
you
ok
jonathan
stops
playing
waves
cut
to
the
band
and
jumps
down
off
the
stage
karen
that's
your
name
isn't
it
ii
signed
my
book
for
you
jonathan
holds
her
arms
tell
me
what
hurt
you
karen
i
can
help
cut
to
the
interior
of
jonathan's
mansion
jonathan
leading
karen
to
fireplace
let's
get
you
warmed
up
buffy
to
a
policeman
what's
going
on
why
are
you
here
riley
is
beside
buffy
in
a
different
room
another
policeman
is
visible
through
glass
mr
levinson
someone
on
your
staff
reported
a
disturbance
a
third
policeman
is
visible
in
the
room
when
i
realized
it
was
on
your
property
i
thought
i'd
better
come
down
in
person
that's
all
right
sergeant
i
have
it
under
control
of
course
sir
glad
to
see
you're
alright
karen
i
know
you're
scared
but
i
need
to
hear
your
description
again
it
was
ugly
big
ugly
all
bent
over
sort
of
with
these
huge
arms
and
like
scabs
and
stuff
that
must
have
been
very
frightening
i'm
so
sorry
oh
oh
i
forgot
it
had
a
mark
a
mark
on
it's
forehead
like
a
symbol
riley
hands
her
pen
and
a
notepad
and
she
draws
the
symbol
a
triangle
with
a
six
pointed
star
or
asterisk
in
it
jonathan
takes
the
notepad
and
rises
his
confidence
and
warmth
have
evaporated
well
this
is
a
clue
buffy
sensing
something
jonathan
jonathan
in
the
calm
voice
i've
heard
of
this
it's
not
a
demon
just
a
monster
not
much
more
than
an
animal
it
sticks
to
the
woods
doesn't
come
near
populated
areas
but
it
did
this
time
it
might
again
buffy
eager
maybe
we
should
patrol
riley
eager
to
please
if
you
want
me
to
mobilize
the
squad
actually
i
think
karen
simply
startled
it
probably
more
afraid
of
you
than
you
were
of
it
i'll
patrol
but
you
don't
need
to
worry
about
it
i
can
handle
it
on
my
own
now
let's
see
about
getting
karen
a
ride
home
buffy
looks
suspicious
cut
to
a
library
pan
past
a
disemboweled
body
to
adam
and
a
vampire
adam
is
sitting
in
front
of
five
screens
showing
television
scenes
two
of
the
screens
have
visible
computers
attached
i
wish
you'd
get
rid
of
that
body
the
smell's
making
me
hungry
you
wouldn't
want
it
it
had
a
blood
disease
it
didn't
know
it
but
it
would
have
been
dead
within
the
year
humans
sense
so
little
of
what
they
carry
inside
oh
alright
well
you're
the
evil
messiah
guy
so
heh
oh
hey
there's
something
new
in
town
yeah
attacked
a
girl
caused
a
little
fuss
oh
he
was
there
pfft
he
has
gestured
to
television
images
of
jonathan
jonathan
jonathan
tell
me
who
is
he
heh
you're
joking
right
jonathan
is
jonathan
look
all
five
screens
or
televisions
seem
to
have
scenes
of
jonathan
these
are
lies
adam
turns
off
the
tvs
none
of
this
is
real
the
world
has
been
changed
it's
intriguing
but
it's
wrong
the
vampire
looks
back
and
forth
feels
ok
to
me
you're
under
his
spell
just
like
the
others
i
seem
to
be
the
only
one
who
is
not
really
and
what
makes
you
so
special
i'm
aware
i
know
every
molecule
of
myself
and
everything
around
me
no
one
no
human
no
demon
has
ever
been
as
awake
and
alive
as
i
am
you
are
all
just
shadows
oh
so
what
do
what
do
you
do
now
vampire
enthused
hey
you
could
kill
jonathan
vampire
shakes
head
well
or
you
could
try
the
guy's
like
a
dynamo
of
action
i
don't
need
to
do
anything
these
magicks
are
unstable
corrosive
they
will
inevitably
lead
to
chaos
and
i
am
interested
in
chaos
cut
to
jonathan
staring
in
the
fire
in
his
mansion
the
music
is
pensive
the
camera
revolves
around
him
slowly
a
blonde
girl
in
some
printed
lingerie
comes
to
a
landing
and
looks
down
at
him
girl
in
a
nordic
accent
jonathan
aren't
you
coming
to
bed
her
twin
comes
up
beside
her
yeah
it's
getting
late
be
right
there
he
removes
his
robe
revealing
the
same
triangle
with
the
six
pointed
asterisk
in
it
that
the
monster
has
on
its
forehead
the
symbol
has
been
scarred
on
the
back
of
his
left
shoulderblade
cut
to
campus
lawns
night
buffy
willow

i'm
glad

ok
everyone
in

have
go
fight
this
thing

the
weapons

at
giles'
it
shouldn't
take
too
long
no
go

'no

jonathan
did
he
said
it
was
some
brainless
beast
and
that
he
would
take
care
of
it
himself
oh
cool
i
guess
i
don't
know
he
just
he
seemed
a
little
scared
heh
buffy
this
is
jonathan
you
know
he
doesn't
get
scared
you
talked
about
it
when
you
gave
him
the
class
protector
award
at
the
prom
you're
right
ummm
my
exit
willow
ii'll
see
you
tomorrow
willow
takes
tara
by
the
forearm
briefly
ok
tara
walks
off
so
saw
you
and
riley
with
the
dancing
it
was
a
great
dance
yeah
for
the
first
time
it
felt
like
faith
wasn't
there
like
no
one
was
there
but
us
cut
to
interior
halls
tara
walking
alone
in
the
halls
hears
something
and
she
walks
more
quickly
double
doors
in
front
of
her
crash
open
and
the
monster
is
there
the
monster
backhands
her
and
she
falls
it
swipes
at
her
as
she
is
on
her
back
and
she
holds
her
hands
up
defensively
act

tara
slides
on
the
floor
as
she
was
pushed
from
behind
or
ran
forward
and
fell
she
turns
back
toward
the
monster
and
chants
desperately
as
she
scuttles
backwards
on
her
hands
bottom
and
heels
sensus
confundantur
at
aer
oppleatur
she
holds
her
arms
out
and
dust
or
smoke
springs
from
her
arms
blinding
the
monster
the
monster
chitters
as
it
waves
at
the
dust
tara
gets
up
and
runs
into
a
janitor's
closet
the
lock
clicks
the
monster
bangs
on
the
door
cut
to
tara's
room
knocking
willow
lets
buffy
in
what's
going
on
buffy
sees
tara
laying
on
the
bed
with
scratches
and
abrasions
oh
my
god
tara
lies
on
the
bed
in
a
semifetal
position
shivering
she's
gonna
be
ok
but
she's
terrified
what
happened
what
did
this
someone
found
her
in
the
janitor's
closet
about
an
hour
ago
ii
think
she
was
there
all
night
she
was
all
alone
tara
what
did
this
big
lumpy
had
something
on
its
on
its
head
like
a
greek
letter
only
not
buffy
takes
some
paper
and
draws
the
symbol
that
karen
did
this
was
it
this
tara
nods
buffy
jonathan
said
we
were
all
safe
jonathon
said
it
cut
to
a
street
buffy
walks
and
thinks
in
the
background
is
poster
after
poster
of
jonathancom
cut
to
xander's
basement
anya
is
standing
in
the
doorway
xander's
not
here
oh
buffy
stays
you're
not
going
away
why
aren't
you
going
away
oh
i
was
kind
of
hoping
to
look
at
some
of
xander's
stuff
oh
anya
smiles
sure
come
on
in
anya
waves
buffy
in
make
yourself
at
home
and
so
on
anya
sits
on
the
couch
and
starts
reading
jonathan's
book
buffy
sees
a
poster
of
jonathan
a
jonathan
comic
and
lots
of
trading
cards
of
jonathan
many
pictures
of
jonathan
adorn
the
walls
after
looking
around
buffy
sits
on
a
table
or
couch
arm
near
anya
oh
you're
still
here
anya
smiles
faintly
that's
nice
may
i
ask
you
something
does
it
every
seem
just
a
little
strange
that
jonathan
is
so
good
at
everything
anya
shrugs
he's
jonathan
she
resumes
reading
the
book
buffy
takes
the
book
hey
i
was
just
at
the
part
where
he
invented
the
internet
anya
he
fights
better
than
i
do
and
i'm
the
slayer
buffy
points
to
self
the
slayer
that's
supposed
to
mean
something
right
oh
buck
up
you
anya
punches
buffy
in
the
arm
very
softly
you
kill
the
best
anya
makes
rah
rah
gestures
go
you
kill
kill
actually
not
needing
validation
right
now
but
thank
you
he
just
seems
too
perfect
buffy
looks
at
the
book
which
is
titled
'oh
jonathan'
an
autobiography
i
don't
know
so
i
can
have
my
book
back
anya
when
you
were
a
demon
you
granted
wishes
right
vengeance
wishes
on
exboyfriends
i'd
wish
he
was
a
dog
or
ugly
or
in
love
with
president
mckinley
or
something
but
someone
could
wish
the
whole
world
to
be
different
right
that's
possible
sure
alternate
realities
you
could
uh
could
have
like
a
world
without
shrimp
or
with
you
know
nothing
but
shrimp
you
could
even
make
like
a
freaky
world
where
jonathan's
some
kind
of
not
perfect
mouth
breather
if
that's
what's
blowing
up
your
skirt
these
days
just
don't
ask
me
to
live
there
now
if
i
uh
could
just
have
book
back
you
could
be
on
your
way
someplace
else
buffy
handing
back
book
here
cut
to
giles'
apartment
buffy
is
addressing
riley
giles
xander
anya
and
willow
i'm
just
saying
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
hhe
starred
in
the
matrix
but
he
never
left
town
and
how'd
he
graduate
from
med
school
he's
only
eighteen
years
old
effective
time
management
ii'm
sorry
buffy
but
i
just
don't
understand
what
you're
trying
to
say
yeah
and
when
is
jonathan
going
to
get
here
and
start
the
meeting
this
is
the
meeting
this
is
the
meeting
well
i
was
just
kind
of
wondering
if
maybe
anyone
thought
that
jonathan
was
kind
of
too
perfect
no
he's
not
he's
just
perfect
enough
he
crushed
the
bones
of
the
master
he
blew
up
a
big
snake
made
out
of
mayor
and
he
coached
the
us
women's
soccer
team
to
stunning
world
cup
victory
we
saw
him
doing
those
things
but
that's
just
it
i'm
not
entirely
sure
that
we
can
trust
our
memories
anya
tell
them
about
the
alternate
universes
oh
ok
umm
say
you
really
like
shrimp
a
lot
or
we
could
say
you
don't
like
shrimp
at
all
giles
nods
but
keeps
eating
blah
i
wish
there
weren't
any
shrimp
you
would
say
to
yourself
stop
you're
saying
it
wrong
i
think
that
jonathan
may
be
doing
something
so
that
he's
manipulating
the
world
and
we're
all
like
his
pawns
or
prawns
buffy
stares
at
anya
stop
with
the
shrimp
i
am
trying
to
do
something
here
giles
still
eating
of
course
but
it
may
be
a
little
out
of
your
depth
i'm
not
sounds
like
nonsense
buffy
looks
discouraged
but
i'm
starting
to
know
this
girl
pretty
well
riley
stands
walks
and
stops
beside
buffy
and
i
think
she
sees
things
that
the
rest
of
us
don't
i
think
for
once
we
should
follow
her
lead
ok
i
think
jonathan
might
be
ignoring
evidence
i
think
he
might
have
let
tara
get
hurt
on
purpose
no
no
how
did
he
ignore
evidence
the
monster
had
a
mark
on
it
jonathan
saw
it
aand
he
kind
of
blinked
he
blinked
the
man
moistened
his
eyeballs
and
we're
having
a
meeting
about
it
he
knows
something
about
the
monster
he
was
reacting
to
the
mark
oh
buffy
jumps
up
wait
i
remember
something
giles
do
you
have
a
jonathan
swimsuit
calendar
no
buffy
frowns
in
confusion
and
stares
at
giles
yes
it
was
a
gift
all
move
to
look
at
calendar
buffy
flipping
through
the
months
of
the
calendar
no
no
whoa
no
there
willow
dismayed
oh
yeah
pretty
darn
lickable
the
other
kind
of
oh
that's
it
that's
what
tara
saw
why
would
jonathan
have
the
same
mark
as
the
monster
i
don't
know
but
he's
definitely
keeping
jonathan
standing
in
doorway
is
this
a
private
conversation
or
can
mr
july
sit
in
again
he
is
dressed
in
a
very
sharp
suit
and
tie
combination
jonathan
anya
rapidly
hi
buffy
was
just
saying
how
you
had
a
monster
cut
up
willow's
friend
and
buffy
turns
suddenly
to
anya
anya
silently
mouths
'what'
buffy
no
buffy
closes
door
it's
just
the
mark
you
said
it
was
safe
and
it
wasn't
i'm
sorry
i
just
don't
understand
then
i'll
explain
all
sit
or
take
positions
to
listen
buffy
is
right
xander
distressed
no
willow
looks
upset
i
do
have
a
history
with
the
creature
the
monster
the
problem
is
every
time
i
face
it
my
mind
becomes
sort
of
confused
there's
some
kind
of
power
it
possesses
oh
oh
he's
like
your
kryptonite
maybe
i
just
knows
it
takes
all
my
energy
to
try
and
fight
the
confusion
that's
why
i
had
his
mark
tattooed
on
me
so
that
i
wouldn't
underestimate
it
next
time
buffy
is
suspicious
riley
satisfied
this
does
explain
everything
i
knew
you
wouldn't
do
anything
on
purpose
willow
relieved
and
smiling
me
too
and
that
whole
alternate
universe
thing
was
too
freaky
jonathan
let's
go
after
the
monster
right
now
you
and
me
i'm
sure
it's
left
town
by
now
that's
been
its
pattern
we
can
try
jonathan
not
confident
sure
let's
do
that
bye
jonathan
goodbye
they
leave
cut
to
graveyard
oh
look
jonathan
taking
the
little
sidekick
out
for
a
walk
are
we
shut
up
spike
spike
laughs
ooh
ooh
ooh
semi
harsh
language
from
betty
you're
feisty
when
the
big
guy
standing
beside
you
spike
sighs
someday
sweet
slayer
spike
puts
a
hand
on
buffy's
hair
i
would
love
to
take
you
on
spike
moves
his
hand
to
her
neck
and
just
below
her
throat
see
you
face
the
evil
alone
for
once
as
he
starts
to
move
his
hand
lower
jonathan
grabs
spike's
wrist
and
shoves
him
back
against
a
nearby
crypt
that's
enough
of
the
creepy
small
talk
we're
looking
for
a
monster
why
would
i
know
about
that
every
demon
in
this
town's
gunning
for
you
right
now
so
i
figure
you're
probably
keeping
pretty
good
track
of
them
big
arms
mark
on
its
head
have
you
seen
it
no
but
then
again
i'm
probably
lying
jonathan
releases
spike
and
turns
to
buffy
we're
not
getting
anything
out
of
him
he
walks
away
and
spike
holds
the
back
of
his
head
buffy
lunges
forward
and
shoves
spike
back
against
the
crypt
again
spike
surprised
hey
what
are
you
doing
jonathan
turns
around
surprised
as
well
you're
not
supposed
to
do
that
you're
pretty
much
relying
on
butcher's
blood
these
days
right
spike
what
are
you
saying
just
that
the
butchers
in
this
town
respect
jonathan
they
do
him
a
favor
and
you
might
find
yourself
getting
kind
of
thirsty
she
lets
spike
go
and
throws
her
hands
up
jonathan
tilts
his
head
and
looks
at
spike
spike
sighs
look
i
don't
know
much
ok
some
vampires
got
kicked
out
of
a
cave
in
the
hills
behind
brookside
park
jonathan
tilts
his
head
and
he
and
buffy
walk
off
i
don't
know
what
did
the
kicking
out
but
it's
probably
pretty
big
jonathan
holds
his
hand
up
dismissively
as
he
and
buffy
stroll
off
spike
sighs
and
grabs
the
back
of
his
head
again
that
was
very
good
buffy
smiles
jonathon
rebuttons
his
jacket
very
good
cut
to
giles'
apartment
riley
is
walking
back
and
forth
with
a
book
anya
and
willow
are
reading
on
the
couch
and
xander
is
sitting
and
reading
opposite
them
these
spells
these
really
work
i
mean
can
you
really
'turn
your
enemies
inside
out'
or
learn
to
'excrete
gold
coins'
that
one's
not
so
much
fun
they
work
riley
but
they
take
concentration
being
attuned
with
the
forces
of
the
universe
right
you
can't
just
go
'librum
incendere'
and
expect
the
page
of
xander's
book
bursts
into
flame
xander
is
shocked
and
riley
looks
up
xander
slams
the
book
closed
extinguishing
the
fire
xander
don't
speak
latin
in
front
of
the
books
hey
ii
found
the
mark
it's
part
of
an
augmentation
spell
willow
distressed
jonathan
did
an
augmentation
spell
what
uh
did
he
have
uh
you
know
him
and
how
we
see
him
this
spell
turns
the
sorcerer
into
a
sort
of
paragon
the
best
of
everything
everyone's
ideal
butbut
there's
a
drawback
a
drawback
that
happens
a
lot
giles
reading
the
book
over
willow's
shoulder
yes
in
order
to
balance
the
new
force
of
good
the
spell
has
to
create
the
opposing
force
of
evil
the
worst
of
everything
everyone's
nightmare
he
created
the
monster
so
we're
saying
he
did
a
spell
just
to
make
us
think
he
was
cool
yes
that
is
so
cool
giles
buffy
and
jonathan
are
going
after
this
nightmare
thing
are
they
going
to
be
ok
it
seems
that
the
wellbeing
of
this
creature
is
linked
to
jonathan
if
it
dies
the
spell
is
broken
and
jonathan
reverts
to
whatever
he
was
before
jonathan
isn't
gonna
want
buffy
to
get
very
far
cut
to
interior
of
a
cave
jonathan
and
buffy
stop
at
the
precipice
of
a
seemingly
bottomless
pit
wow
fall
down
there
and
be
dead
for
a
while
yeah
jonathan
thinking
and
looking
at
buffy
don't
want
that
to
happen
jonathan
slowly
reaches
and
grabs
buffy's
wrist
as
she
is
looking
around
the
cave
buffy
looks
at
him
jonathan
leading
her
away
from
the
pit
come
on
we've
got
a
monster
to
the
monster
growls
as
he
strikes
jonathan
with
an
uppercut
and
sends
him
flying
back
over
the
pit
he
falls
unconscious
the
monster
roars
act

willow
confused
buffy
was
right
willow
trying
again
buffy
was
right
it
doesn't
sound
very
likely
does
it
so
if
this
is
the
world
he
created
what's
the
real
world
like
i'm
scared
everything's
going
to
change
well
actually
it'll
remain
pretty
much
the
same
except
jonathan
won't
be
jonathan
not
our
jonathan
anyway
no
no
no
world
without
sunshine
world
without
joy
but
wait
it
only
changes
back
if
buffy
kills
this
thing
i
mean
if
she
loses
then
we
could
be
stuck
in
this
wrong
world
forever
things
looking
up
i
mean
we're
all
happy
here
right
you
know
if
she
doesn't
get
killed
giles
can
buffy
do
it
ii
honestly
don't
know
she's
never
stood
alone
against
something
like
this
before
cut
to
interior
of
cave
jonathan
is
slowly
waking
up
to
the
sounds
of
the
monster
growling
and
blows
being
exchanged
the
monster
grabs
buffy
and
throws
her
she
tumbles
and
falls
trumpet
music
blares
jonathan
flips
to
his
feet
breaks
off
a
stalactite
and
hits
the
monster
in
the
head
with
it
twice
driving
it
to
its
knees
buffy
comes
to
jonathan
ducks
a
swipe
and
grabs
the
monster
from
behind
jonathan
what
do
i
do
i
think
you're
going
to
have
to
handle
this
one
solo
what
but
i
you'll
know
you
used
to
and
the
more
you
hurt
it
the
more
i'll
lose
my
he
kicks
the
monster
in
the
head
while
holding
it
what
lose
your
jonathan
spins
the
monster
towards
buffy
buffy
trips
the
stumbling
monster
and
it
falls
jonathan
shudders
as
if
his
strength
is
gone
and
hides
behind
a
rock
buffy
delivers
a
sequence
of
kicks
to
the
monster
when
the
monster
tries
to
strike
her
she
catches
its
arm
and
kicks
it
twice
more
and
it
falls
buffy
smiling
i
remember
this
this
good
buffy
tries
to
punch
the
monster
but
it
catches
her
and
throws
her
down
jonathan
jumps
out
from
behind
the
rock
as
the
trumpets
blare
the
monster
charges
buffy
but
she
kicks
it
again
again
jonathan
runs
back
behind
the
rock
buffy
delivers
some
more
kicks
to
the
monster
knocking
it
down
the
monster
jumps
to
its
feet
and
buffy
charges
it
it
sidesteps
and
throws
her
down
one
of
her
arms
is
in
the
pit
and
her
head
is
over
it
before
the
monster
can
finish
off
buffy
jonathan
charges
and
tackles
it
from
behind
knocking
it
into
the
pit
he
falls
in
too
but
buffy
reaches
and
grabs
him
by
the
ankle
he
whimpers
a
little
hanging
upside
down
cut
to
a
shimmering
wave
of
light
passes
over
the
town
the
billboard
of
jonathan
selling
shoes
changes
to
a
newspaper
with
a
dalmatian
saying
they
aren't
just
in
black
white
a
movie
marquee
saying
'being
jonathan
levinson'
changes
to
'closed
for
repairs'
a
'jonathancom'
poster
changes
to
a
'the
dingoes
ate
my
baby'
poster
cut
to
campus
lawns
daylight
the
gang
is
sitting
beside
a
tree
buffy
riley
xander
willow
anya
and
tara
i
can't
believe
we
believed
it
riley
it
seemed
so
real
well
in
that
world
it
was
real
alternate
realities
are
neat
you
know
what
i'll
always
remember
the
swimsuit
calendar's
sticking
in
my
mind
buffy
looks
at
him
and
raises
her
eyebrows
not
in
a
good
way
i'll
always
remember
the
way
he
made
me
feel
about
me
valued
respected
sort
of
tingly
now
i'm
just
empty
anya
is
also
depressed
poor
xander
i
guess
jonathan
hurt
you
most
of
all
tara
raises
her
hand
ummm
except
of
course
after
tara
willow
smiles
at
tara
did
anyone
else
feel
way
too
tall
i
felt
way
too
tall
buffy
sees
jonathan
looking
over
at
her
and
walks
to
meet
him
i
liked
his
clothes
he
had
really
cool
clothes
still
not
understanding
how
he
got
the
house
and
everything
and
who
really
did
star
in
the
matrix
riley
fading
as
buffy
gets
farther
away
wait
that
wasn't
real
either
hi
i
wasn't
sure
you'd
come
over
everyone's
mostly
forgetting
but
i
think
some
people
are
kind
of
angry
yeah
nobody's
even
talking
to
me
and
the
twins
moved
out
why
did
you
do
it
anyway
no
i
get
why
how
after
the
thing
with
the
bell
tower
and
the
gun
i
went
to
counseling
you
know
other
kids
with
problems
aand
one
of
them
had
this
spell
he
glossed
right
over
the
monster
well
anyway
i
just
ii
just
wanted
to
apologize
nobody
was
supposed
to
get
hurt
jonathan
you
get
why
everyone
is
angry
though
right
it's
not
just
the
monster
people
didn't
like
being
the
little
actors
in
your
sock
puppet
theater
you
weren't
you
weren't
socks
we
were
friends
jonathan
you
can't
keep
trying
to
make
everything
work
out
with
some
big
gesture
all
at
once
things
are
complicated
they
take
time
and
work
yeah
right
he
turns
to
leave
but
stops
and
turns
back
hey
hey
buffy
you
remember
i
gave
you
some
advice
buffy
less
than
amused
watch
out
for
southpaws
uh
no
about
you
and
riley
i
mean
things
are
starting
to
blur
but
this
cool
thing
i
said
um
that
i
don't
really
remember
i
think
it's
right
i
think
it's
kind
of
the
same
thing
you
just
said
to
me
jonathan
pauses
about
things
taking
work
buffy
thoughtful
yeah
i
remember
good
because
it's
true
what
you
have
is
really
complicated
but
it's
worth
it
i
think
that's
what
i
said
he
walks
away
cut
to
riley's
bedroom
buffy
and
riley
are
sitting
and
smooching
i'm
glad
we
talked
this
all
out
we
haven't
talked
at
all
oh
well
whatever
we're
doing
we're
doing
it
great
smooching
resumes
mmmmm
jonathan
riley
pulls
back
buffy
is
almost
smiling
ironic
music
plays
end
