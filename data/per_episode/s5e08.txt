what

waiting

as
various
staff
people
walk
by
cut
to
a
telephone
book
open
to
a
page
where
we
see
a
large
advertisement
for
the
magic
box
your
onestop
spot
to
shop
for
all
your
occult
needs
we
see
tara
and
giles
standing
behind
the
counter
looking
at
the
ad
catchy
think
so
uhhuh
in
a
hard
to
read
sort
of
way
but
i
think
it's
great
oh
tara
moves
away
as
giles
studies
the
ad
and
soundlessly
mouths
the
words
to
himself
the
door
opens
and
anya
enters
followed
by
xander
and
willow
anya
immediately
begins
straightening
the
merchandise
on
the
shelves
i'm
just
saying
i
think
it's
rude
i
wouldn't
call
it
rude
rudeish
rudeesque
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
when
a
person
makes
a
destroy
all
vampires
date
it's
simple
courtesy
to
wait
for
your
codestroyers
am
i
right
giles
i'm
almost
certain
you're
not
but
to
be
fair
i
wasn't
listening
oh
thethe
new
phone
book's
in
with
mr
giles'
ad
anya
races
around
the
counter
shoving
past
tara
oh
nice
yay
am
i
mentioned
anya
looking
eagerly
at
the
ad
not
as
such
anya
disappointed
oh
okay
we
were
supposed
to
hook
up
with
riley
this
morning
to
take
on
a
nest
o'vamps
holed
up
in
a
tomb
so
we
get
there
and
guess
what

him
will
tomb
go
boom
yep
captain
america
blowed
it
up
real
good
all
by
his
lone
wolf
lonesome
hmm
uh
rather
reckless
of
him
giles
we
see
anya
still
studying
the
ad
i'd
say
very
rather
all
that
aside
i
should
think
you'd
be
pleased
to
avoid
the
confrontation
that's
what
i've
been
saying
i
mean
i
for
one
didn't
want
to
start
my
day
with
a
slaughter
anya
suddenly
gets
a
look
of
realization
on
her
face
excitedly
which
really
just
goes
to
show
how
much
i've
grown
anya
smiles
hugely
willow
and
tara
grin
at
each
other
yes

i
could
use
your
help
researching
buffy's
mysterious
woman

fruitful
trying
to
look
up
something

saw
and
don't
know
the
name
of

do
what
i
do
flip
through
the
pages
and
look
busy
it'd
be
nice
if
we
knew
where
she
was
where
she's
hiding
out
no
doubt
lurking
around
some
sewer
or
condemned
church
or
ratinfested
warehouse
you
know
the
usual
haunts
cut
to
a
beautiful
wellappointed
apartment

incantation

and
great
dangers

been
faced
to

make
my
ankle
look
bony

your
terrifically
smooth

is
the
epitome

an
ankle
would
be

i'm
not

and
goes
to
the
window
peeking
around
the
curtain

nothing
worse

takes
off
his
jacket
then
notices
something
on
the
floor
and
picks
it
up
it's
a
blanket
he
frowns
looks
up
the
stairs
drops
both
blanket
and
jacket
and
starts
up
the
stairs
cut
to
spike
holding
a
pink
sweater
up
to
his
face
and
inhaling
deeply
he
lowers
the
sweater
sighing
happily
then
takes
another
sniff
as
riley
appears
behind
him
what

whirls
around
and
we

quickly
hides
the
sweater
behind
his
back

he's
holding
riley
bemused

he
sniffs
the
sweater
again

spike
presses
the
sweater
against
his
face
and
makes
angry
growling
noises
riley
snatches
the
sweater
away
from
him
tosses
it
aside
then
grabs
spike
by
the
front
of
his
shirt
out
as
riley
hustles
spike
out
spike
grabs
a
piece
of
lacy
pink
underwear
from

just
a
shadow
they
smile
bravely
at
each
other
buffy
turns
to
look
at
the
images
again
i
just
wish
we
knew
what
we
were
dealing
with
cut
to
magic
box
the
table
is
spread
with
books
xander
tara
and
willow
sitting
around
it
it
feels
like
we're
going
around
in
circles
in
the
background
we
see
anya
looking
at
bookshelves
and
a
customer
walking
through
the
shop
our
circles
are
going
around
in
circles
we've
got
dizzy
circles
here
giles
the
customer
walks
up
to
the
counter
and
hands
giles
an
item
ah
weeping
buddha
shoulders
your
spiritual
burden
giles
wraps
the
item
makes
a
lovely
paperweight
too
maybe
she's
not
in
the
books
what

mean
what
if
she's
not
a
demon
or
sorceress
or
spirit
or
whatever
these
books

tara
giles
looks

predates
the
written
word
willow
thinks
of
something
giles
the
dagon
sphere
you
said
that
was
created
to
repel
that
which
cannot
be
named
giles
removes
glasses
thoughtfully
so
i'm
thinking
maybe
she
predates
language
itself
willow
nods
significantly
xander
looks
puzzled
well
hey
if
it
means
i
don't
have
to
read
any
more
woo
and
might
i
add
a
big
hoo
if

right
then
we're
blind
there's
there's
no
way
we
can
determine
her
moves
her
habits
where
she'll
turn
up
next
he
turns
around
putting
his
glasses
back
on
and
is
confronted
by
glory

comes
over
to
sit
next
to
her
she
puts
her
head
on

of
her
head

up

in
the
left

of
the
cerebrum

tumor
seems
to
have
started
there
in
other
words
it
hasn't
spread
from
another
part
of
the
body
he
keeps
talking
but
his
voice
fades
out
as
the
camera
zooms
slowly
in
on
buffy's
dismayed
face
blackout
act
ii

fade
back
in
on
buffy
still
listening
to
the
doctor
i
know
this
is
very
difficult
and
uh
because
of
the
nature
of
your
mother's
illness
unfortunately
things
may
progress
very
quickly
things
what
things
symptoms
there's
a
fair
variety
that
might
present
loss
of
vision
or
appetite
lack
of
muscle
control
uh
mood
swings
but
what
can
we
do
well
not
much
until
we
determine
if
the
tumor's
operable
which
we
are
working
on
dr
isaacs
leads
buffy
over
to
some
chairs
and
they
sit
is
there
something
that
i
i
mean
can
i
help
well
there's
some
literature
you
might
want
to
look
at
if
we
aren't
able
to
go
in
surgically
there
are
a
number
of
new
treatments
that
are
very
promising
your
mother's
prognosis
is
a
lot
better
today
than
it
would
have
been
only
a
year
ago
even
if
the
tumor's
not
operable
she
has
a
real
chance
what's
a
real
chance
nearly
one
out
of
three
patients
with
this
condition
does
just
fine
dr
isaacs
buffy
sits
back
looking
shocked
camera

at
school
and

the
magic
shop
in
an
hour
when
she
gets
off
of
course
whatever
you
need
me
to
do
riley
buffy
starts
to
leave
buffy
riley
she
stops
what
do
you
want
me
to
tell
dawn
about
your
mom
they
both
look
at
dawn
still
sleeping
in
the
chair
with
riley's
jacket
over
her
tell
her
we
don't
know
anything
yet
riley
nods
buffy
turns
and
leaves
cut
to
magic
shop
anya
is
looking
through
a
pile
of
receipts
we
see
xander
in
the
background
suddenly
anya
stops
and
stares
at
a
receipt
hey
anya
louder
hey
anya
shouting
hey
xander
turns
to
look
at
her
anya
holds
up
the
receipt
and
waves
it
as
giles
willow
and
tara
come
rushing
over
giles
wears
a
large
false
smile
hey
anya
your
heys
are
startling
the
customers
andand
pretty
much
the
state
you
sold
someone
a
khul's
amulet
and
a
sobekian
bloodstone
yes
i
believe
i
did
giles
takes
receipt
and
examines
it
are
you
stupid
or
something
allow
me
to
answer
that
question
with
a
firing
she's
kidding
xander
to
anya
an
we
talked
about
the
employeeemployer
vocabulary
nonos
that
was
number
five
anya
grabs
receipt
back
from
giles
you
never
sell
these
things
together
ever
bad
news
don't
you
know
about
the
sobekites
oh
i
do
it
was
an
ancient
egyptian
cult
heavy
into
dark
magic
willow
anya
nods
and
the
khul's
amulet
wasn't
that
a
transmogrification
conduit
damn
straight
be
that
as
it
may
i
still
see
no
reason
for
concern
i
mean
thethe
sobekian
transmogrification
spells
were
lost
thousands
of
years
ago
and
besides
the
young
woman
to
whom
i
sold
them
would
have
to
have
had
enormous
power
giles
stops
suddenly
willow
quietly
young
woman
oh
dear
lord
everyone
looks
alarmed
except
xander
who
looks
confused
what
cut
to
a
carousel
whirling
around
brightly
lit
playing
cheerful
music
pan
down
to
riley
and
dawn
sitting
on
a
bench
in
front
of
it
dawn
is
holding
an
icecream
float
poking
at
it
with
her
spoon
distracted
you're
melting
oh
um
guess
i'm
not
hungry
maybe
i'm
not
making
this
any
better
no
i
just
this
is
better
dawn
they
smile
nervously
at
each
other
and
are
quiet
for
a
moment
i
had
my
tenth
birthday
party
here
really
mmhmm
we'd
just
moved
to
sunnydale
and
mom
rented
the
carousel
for
an
entire
hour
for
just
me
and
my
friends
dawn
pauses
except
i
hadn't
made
any
friends
yet
so
it
was
just
me
and
mom
and
buffy
riding
it
by
ourselves
over
and
over
and
over
again
dawn
riley
smiles
for
the
whole
hour
just
so
mom
felt
like
we'd
gotten
our
money's
worth
dawn
pause
then
dawn
speaks
with
her
voice
breaking
she's
she's
not
gonna
get
better
is
she
riley
leans
toward
her
absolutely
she
will
summers
women
are
tough
dawn
smiles
i'm
really
glad
you're
here
thanks
buffy's
glad
too
riley
smiles
skeptically
yeah
she
sure
cries
a
lot
less
with
you
than
she
did
with
angel
riley
surprised
angel
made
her
cry
a
lot
huh
everything
with
him
was
all

dawn
grimaces
makes
claw
motions
with
hands
eee
you
know
all
you
know
my
boyfriend's
a
vampire
crazy
crazy
dawn
riley
nods
every
day
was
like
the
end
of
the
world
she
doesn't
get
all
worked
up
like
that
over
you
riley
looks
stung
but
tries
not
to
show
it
dawn
realizes
she
didn't
say
the
right
thing
i
think
you've
been
really
good
for
her
she
smiles
encouragingly
riley
tries
to
return
her
smile
but
he
doesn't
really
feel
it
cut
to
magic
shop
so
i
figured
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
mystical
cure
right
i
mean
like
a
a
potion
or
a
spell
or
something
we
have
to
look
during
this
speech
the
camera
pans
around
the
table
showing
us
anya
xander
tara
buffy
and
willow
sitting
and
giles
standing
leaning
with
his
hands
on
the
table
we
can
look
i
mean
we
will
but
i
haven't
seen
anything
the
truth
is
uh
the
mystical
and
the
medical
aren't
meant
to
mix
buffy
sorry
um
the
human
mind
is
very
delicate
too
much
can
go
wrong
yeah
i've
heard
stories
about
people
trying
healing
spells
if
we
did
something
it
could
make
things
a
lot
worse
buffy
we've
done
just
about
enough
making
things
worse
for
one
day
haven't
we
everyone
looks
guilty
except
buffy
who
looks
confused
why
what
do
you
mean
uh
nothing
anya
broke
a
bippity
boppity
boo
a
thing
don't
worry
about
it
i
did
not
i
didn't
break
giles
anya
buffy
doesn't
need
to
hear
about
your
clumsiness
right
now
anya
sighs
my
clumsiness
i
mean
that
is
so
anya
willow
and
xander
give
her
meaningful
looks
she
looks
at
buffy
like
me
slippery
slippery
butterfingers
buffy
not
fooled
what
happened
nothing
to
concern
you
uh
buffy
giles
giles
sighs
the
uh
giles
embarrassed
demon
woman
was
here
the
one
who
attacked
you
buffy
looks
alarmed
it's
no
biggie
sheshe
just
got
an
amulet
and
a
bloodstone
that
can
create
a
monster

biggie
my
god

you

okay
though
i
mean
did
no
one
got
hurt
right
oh
no
thankfully
no
uh
no
violence
to
speak
of
okay
so
that's
good

buffy
not
understanding
why
everyone
looks
guilty
how
did
she
get
away
with
this
bad
mojo
stuff
pause
the
others
look
at
each
other
in
embarrassment
anya
whispering
giles
sold
it
to
her
anya
buffy
looks
at
giles
accusingly
giles
defensive
i
i
i
i
didn't
know
it
was
her
i
mean
how
could
i
giles
sighs
if
it's
any
consolation
i
may
have
overcharged
her
anya
figured
out
what
the
demon
lady's
up
to

their
high
priest
khul

mystic
powers

apprehensive

aside
exposing
his
neck
sandy
leans
forward
to
bite

jerks
in
pain
as

on

slithering
down
darkened
streets
with
giles'
car
in
pursuit
they
careen
around
a
corner
and
nearly
slam
into
another
car
the
snake
tears
down
a
section
of
fence
that's
covered
with
a
tarp
and
moves
off
past
it
as
giles'
car
passes
the
fence
with
a
screech
of
tires
giles
reverses
back
into
view
and
buffy
leaps
out
of
the
car
and
runs
through
the
broken
fence
past
picnic
tables
across
a
wide
expanse
of
grass
we
see
buffy
running
across
the
grass
after
the
snake
she
seems
to
be
tiring
the
creature
knocks
over
a
sign
reading
bike
path
closed
after
dusk
buffy
pauses
to
grab
a
piece
of
chain
from
another
section
of
fence
as
the
snake
flees
into
a
more
wooded
area
buffy
leaps
up
onto
a
large
rock
as
the
snake
passes
around
it
she
leaps
off
the
rock
and
lands
on
the
snake's
back
looping
the
chain
around
its
neck
the
snake
rears
up
and
thrashes
trying
to
throw
her
off
but
she
holds
on
tightening
the
chain
around
its
neck
and
riding
it
like
a
wild
horse
it
bucks
and
fights
but
finally
goes
still
as
a
gray
film
comes
down
over
its
eyes
buffy
frowns
and
lets
go
of
the
chain
which
drops
to
the
ground
suddenly
the
gray
film
slides
aside
and
the
snake
rears
up
again
throwing
buffy
off
she
flies
backward
and
lands
on
her
back
in
the
grass
the
snake
turns
to
growl
at
her
as
she
gets
up
she
punches
it
in
the
face
making
it
reel
backward
she
climbs
on
top
of
it
and
begins
punching
it
in
the
face
over
and
over
we
see
the
tip
of
its
tail
thrashing
and
finally
lying
still
as
the
creature
dies
buffy
continues
to
punch
it
grunting
with
each
blow
long
shot
of
buffy
crouching
over
the
dead
creature
and
still
steadily
punching
it
pan
up
across
lawn
and
trees
and
we

looming
up

glory
in
one
of

looking

in
on

frowns
and
looks
from
