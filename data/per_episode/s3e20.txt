buffy
is
napping
in
angel's
bed
angel
is
watching
her
sleep
he
smiles
at
her
as
she
wakes
buffy
smiles
what
do
i
have
funny
bed
hair
or
something
or
something
i
guess
we
got
a
little
carried
away
with
the
whole
postslayage
nap
thing
buffy
feels
her
hair
ohhh
not
good
buffy
sits
up
where
you
going
to
go
kill
a
cat
on
my
head
no
mirrors
you
know
this
place
really
isn't
girlfriendly
no
mirrors
no
natural
light
i
think
you
look
perfect
oh
yeah
i
really
like
okay
buffy
lays
down
maybe
we
should
think
about
getting
a
few
mirrors
and
maybe
a
drawer
you
know
for
some
of
my
stuff
because
that's
what
couples
do
they
have
drawers
mmmm
that's
right
you
know
ii
figure
that
way
sometimes
i
could
spend
the
night
like
after
the
prom
it
would
be
nice
to
be
able
to
just
come
back
here
and
spend
some
time
together
the
prom
end
of
high
school
rite
of
passage
thingy
think
cotillion
with
spiked
punch
and
electric
slide
right
oh
don't
worry
it's
at
night
and
lots
of
girls
have
older
girlfriends
you'll
blend
i
think
maybe
you
should
go
hunh
noo
must
be
a
few
more
hours
before
sunrise
buffy
gets
up
and
walks
to
the
window
when
she
pulls
back
the
blackout
curtain
it
lets
in
a
blast
of
sunlight
directly
onto
the
bed
with
an
exclamation
angel
rolls
out
of
bed
away
from
the
light
apparently
unharmed
buffy
pulls
the
curtains
closed
suddenly
ooh
sorry
i
guess
it's
later
than
we
thought
angel
has
a
worried
look
opening
credits
scene

daylight
outside
sunnydale
high
xander
is
walking
slowly
when
anyanka
intercepts
him
and
walks
beside
him
xander
well
hey
it's
demon
anya
punisher
of
evil
males
still
haven't
got
your
powers
back
xander
serious
you
haven't
right
no
i
will
though
it's
just
a
matter
of
time
so
now
how
did
that
work
women
would
wish
horrible
things
upon
their
exboyfriends
you'd
show
up
and
make
it
happen
that's
right
the
power
of
the
wish
made
me
a
righteous
sword
to
smite
the
unfaithful
well
hey
good
luck
with
that
hope
it
works
out
for
you
you
know
you
can
laugh
but
i
have
witnessed
a
millennium
of
treachery
and
oppression
from
the
males
of
the
species
and
i
have
nothing
but
contempt
for
the
whole
libidinous
lot
of
them
then
why
are
you
talking
to
me
anya
averts
her
eyes
i
don't
have
a
date
for
the
prom
well
gosh
i
wonder
why
not
it
couldn't
possibly
have
anything
to
do
with
your
sales
pitch
men
are
evil
will
you
go
with
me
one
of
us
is
very
confused
and
i
honestly
don't
know
which
you
know
this
happens
to
be
all
your
fault
my
fault
you
were
unfaithful
to
cordelia
so
i
took
on
the
guise
of
a
twelfthgrader
to
tempt
her
with
the
wish
when
i
lost
my
powers
i
got
stuck
in
this
persona
and
now
i
have
all
these
feelings
i
don't
understand
it
i
don't
like
it
all
i
know
is
i
really
want
to
go
to
this
dance
and
i
want
someone
to
go
with
me
be
still
my
heart
oh
wait
it
is
how
come
i
got
the
short
straw
you're
not
quite
as
obnoxious
as
most
of
the
alpha
males
around
here
plus
i
know
you
don't
have
a
date
i
haven't
settled
on
anyone
yet
fine
look
i
know
you
find
me
attractive
i've
seen
you
looking
at
my
breasts
nothing
personal
but
when
a
guy
does
that
it
just
means
his
eyes
are
open
whatever
look
do
you
wanna
go
with
me
or
not
silence

a
picnic

daylight
oz

buffy
and
xander
anya
huh
interesting
choice
choice
is
kind
of
a
broad
term
for
my
situation
see
it's
either
anya
or
the
sock
puppet
of
love
for
this
boy
xander
holds
his
right
hand
in

speaks
in

i
love
you
xander
i'll
never

anya
tries

you
killed

this
anya
is
she
prettier

me
she
just
better
not
try

cross
me
that's
all
i'm
saying
well
at
least
we
all
have
someone
to
go
with
now
some
of
us
are
going
with
demons
but
i
think
that's
a
valid
lifestyle
choice
more
importantly
i
have
the
kick
dress
ooh
the
pink
one
angel's
gonna
lose
it
but
not
his

he's
gonna
lose

there
is
a
knock
at

and
lets
joyce
inside
mrs
summers
i'm
sorry
to
uh
well
i
would
have
called
but
you
know
please
you're
always
welcome
my
goodness
your
place
is
amazing
yeah
i
like
a
lot
of
space
i
don't
get
out
much
during
the
day
no
you
wouldn't
joyce
her
gaze
pauses
on
a
set
of
manacles
that
are
fastened
to
a
wall
can
i
get
you
something
i
don't
have
any
coffee
oh
no
thank
you
i
uh
you
don't
drink
beverages
i
mean
no
i
do
it's
just
the
caffeine
it
makes
me
jittery
oh
i
understand
buffy
spent
the
night
i'm
sorry
about
that
we
came
back
after
patrol
i
i'm
not
interested
in
the
details
that's
not
why
i'm
here
okay
i'm
here
because
i'm
worried
about
you
two
in
general
what
happened
before
when
i
changed
it
won't
happen
again
that's
not
all
i'm
concerned
about
i
don't
have
to
tell
you
that
you
and
buffy
are
from
different
worlds
no
you
don't
she's
had
to
deal
with
a
lot
grew
up
fast
sometimes
even
i
forget
that
she's
still
just
a
girl
i'm
old
enough
to
be
her
ancestor
she's
just
starting
out
in
life
i
know
i
think
about
it
more
now
that
she's
staying
in
sunnydale
good
because
when
it
comes
to
you
angel
she's
just
like
any
other
young
woman
in
love
you're
all
she
can
see
of
tomorrow
but
i
think
we
both
know
that
there
are
some
hard
choices
ahead
if
she
can't
make
them
you're
gonna
have
to
i
know
you
care
about
her
i
just
hope
you
care
enough
scene

in
the
library
willow
oz
buffy
and
xander
so
it
was
blue
and
sorta
short
not
too
short
medium
and
it
had
this
weird
sorta
fringey
stuff
on
its
arms
giles
walking
in
what's
that
a
demon
a
prom
dress
that
will
was
thinking
of
getting
can't
you
ever
get
your
mind
out
of
the
hellmouth
i'd
be
delighted
to
however
the
day
of
the
mayor's
ascension
is
fast
approaching
and
we
don't
know
what
to
expect
well
what
about
the
pages
that
will
stole
from
the
mayor's
book
look
she
put
her
life
on
the
line
there
pal
don't
tell
me
they're
useless
on
the
contrary
no
we
uh
we
know
the
ascension
refers
to
a
human
transforming
into
a
demon
the
living
embodiment
of
an
immortal
and
graduation
day
our
mayor
wilkins
is
scheduled
to
do
just
that
wesley
enters
followed
closely
by
cordelia
wesley
enters
trouble
is
we
don't
know
which
demon
he
is
going
to
become
there
are
thousands
of
species
so
it's
safe
to
say
we
shouldn't
waste
any
time
of
such
trifling
matters
as
a
school
dance
well
that's
too
bad
because
i
bet
you
would
look
way
007
in
a
tux
except
of
course
on
the
actual
night
i
will
be
aiding
mr
giles

with
my
complexion
can
we
please
talk
about
the
ascension
giles
we
get
it
miles
to
go
before
we
sleep
but
especially
if
we're
all
gonna
vaporize

we

a

to
the
stinky
sewers
i'm
sure
i
saw
him
come
down
here
couldn't
we
just
let
this
be
the
vamp
that
got
away
we
could
say
he
was
this
big
buffy
holds
hands
apart
like
a

what
can
i
say
i
need
closure
you
need

you
don't
have
a

do
you
since
when
did
patrolling
go
black
tie
for
the
prom
silly
we
have
more
important
things
to
think
about
right
now
than
a
dance
buffy
sorry
giles
i'll
just
be
quiet
come
on
don't
be
that
way
a
vampire
drops
from
the

growling
not

buffy
casually
stakes
the
vampire
and
turns
to
angel
i'm
not
being
that
way
every
time
i
say
the
word
'prom'
you
get
grouchy
i'm
sorry
i'm
just
worried
that
you're
getting
tooinvested
in
this
whole
thing
what
whole
thing
isn't
this
the
stuff
that
i'm
supposed
to
get
invested
in
going
to
a
formal
graduating
growing
up
i
know
then
what
what's
with
the
dire
it's
uh
it's
nothing
no
you
have
'something'
face
i
think
we
need
to
talk
but
not
now
and
not
here
no
no
if
you
have
something
to
say
then
say
it
buffy
silence
angel
drop
the
cryptic
you're
scaring
me
i've
been
thinking
about
our
future
and
the
more
i
do
the
more
i
feel
like
us
you
and
me
being
together
is
unfair
to
you
is
this
about
what
the
mayor
said
because
he
was
just
trying
to
shake
us
up
he
was
right
no
no
he
wasn't
he's
the
bad
guy
you
deserve
more
you
deserve
something
outside
of
demons
and
darkness
you
should
be
with
someone
who
can
take
you
into
the
light
someone
who
can
make
love
to
you
i
don't
care
about
that
you
will
and
children
children
can
you
say
jumping
the
gun
i
kill
my
goldfish
today
but
you
have
no
idea
how
fast
it
goes
buffy
before
you
know
it
you'll
want
it
all
a
normal
life
i'll
never
have
a
normal
life
right
you'll
always
be
a
slayer
but
that's
all
the
more
reason
why
you
should
have
a
real
relationship
instead
of
this
this
freak
show
angel
buffy
is
stunned
i
didn't
mean
that
i'm
gonna
go
angel
grabs
her
arm
i'm
sorry
buffy
you
know
how
much
i
love
you
it
kills
me
to
say
this
then
don't
who
are
you
to
tell
me
what's
right
for
me
you
think
i
haven't
thought
about
this
have
you
rationally
no
no
of
course
not
i'm
just
some
swoony
little
schoolgirl
right
i'm
trying
to
do
what's
right
here
okay
i'm
trying
to
think
with
my
head
instead
of
my
heart
heart
you
have
a
heart
it
isn't
even
beating
don't
don't
what
don't
love
you
i'm
sorry
you
know
what
i
didn't
know
that
i
got
a
choice
in
that
i'm
never
gonna
change
i
can't
change
i
want
my
life
to
be
with
you
i
don't
you
don't
want
to
be
with
me
i
can't
believe
you're
breaking
up
with
me
it
doesn't
mean
that
i
don't

how
am
i
supposed
to
stay
away
from
you
i'm
leaving
after
the
ascension
after
it's

he's

he's

person
if
you
ask

and
he's
a
supermaxijerk
for
doing
it
right
before
the

it's
not
his
fault
he's
243
years
old
he
doesn't
exactly
get
the
prom
but
he
should
if

will
it's
okay
you
don't
have
to
make
him
the
bad
guy
but
that's
the
best
friend's
job
vilifying
and
grousing
usually
yeah
but
he's
right
i
mean
i
think
maybe
in
the
long
run
that
he's
right
yeah
i
think
he
is
i
mean
i
tried
to
hope
for
the
best
but
i'm
sorry
it
must
be
horrible
i

horrible
is
still

the
same
punch
the
escaped
creature
from
the
dingy
house
bursts
through
the
front
window
of
the
shop
xander
pushes
cordelia
out
of
harm's
way
and
attempts
to
grapple
the
creature
it
pushes
him
down
and
jumps
on
top
of
him
then
it
sees
a
man
wearing
a
tux
and
attacks
that
man
rending
and
tearing
savagely
scene
change

in
the
library
the
scooby
gang
including
wesley
sit
around
the
table
watching
a
surveillance
tape
of
the
attack
right
there
see
it's
it's
like
he
just
realized
he
forgot
to
put
money
in
the
meter
or
something
you
know
the
part
that
totally
weirded
me
out
that
thing
had
good
taste
i
mean
he
chucks
xander
and
went
right
for
the
formal
wear
that's
right
he
left
behind
his
copy
of
monsters
wear
daily
i'm
serious
look
at
the
outfit
that
xander's
wearing
now
look
at
the
kid
that
the
monster
went
after
very
smooth
lines
'til
he
was
shredded
i
don't
want
to
see
it
again
giles
buffy
i
know
it's
horrible
but
if
you're
going
to
hunt
this
creature
you
should
study
it
think
i
got
it
she's
right
i
mean
you've
seen
one
big
hairy
bringer
of
death
you've
seen
'em
all
if
i'm
not
mistaken
this
is
a
hellhound
yes
it's
particularly
vicious
it's
sort
of
a
demon
foot
soldier
bred
during
the
machash
wars
trained
solely
to
kill
they
feed
off
the
brains
of
their
foes
look
right
there
zoom
in
on
that
it's
a
videotape
so
they
do
it
on
television
all
the
time
not
with
a
regular

they
don't
perhaps
we
could
stay
on
the
topic
for
once
what
were
you

this
afternoon
what
um
i
was
burning
a
hole
in
daddy's

after
them
and
tell
them
that
they
can't
go
that

oh
buffy
i'm
sorry

really
know
what

of
thing
requires
ice
cream
of
some
kind
ice
cream
will
come
first
i
want
to
take
out
psycho
boy
you

xander
and
anya
stroll

so
she
wished
her
husband's
head
would
explode
which
was
great
except
we
were
standing
three
feet
from
him
at
the
time
what
a
mess
of
course
you
know
during
the
plague
it
was
always
parts
falling
off
well
that
got
old
since
pretty
much
they
were
anyway
the
renaissance
that
was

anya
voice
fades
as
they
exit
stage
right
giles
and
wesley
stand
by
a
table
munching
horsd'oeuvres
well
i
must
say
this
is
all
rather
odd
to
me
oh
yes
at
an
allmale
preparatory
they
didn't
go
in
for
this
sort
of
thing
no
of
course
not
unless
you
count
the
nights
you
made
the
lower
classmen
get
up
as
girls
and
watched
them

wesley
stops

besieged
bedeviled
or
beheaded
or
something
it's
not
gonna
happen
you're
not
even
a
little
nervous
you

let
us
down
want
to
share
some
punch
oz
and
willow
walk
by
wesley
approaches
cordelia
may
i
say
you
look
smashing
it's
a
start
cordelia
takes
wesley's
arm
pan
to
xander
and
anya
xander
has
a
glazed
look
so
then
this
one
time
this
girl
wished
her
ex
would
cannibalize
himself
even
i
had
a
hard
time
watching
that
let
me
tell
you
cordelia
wesley

with
labels
like

disarms
him
and
ties
his
hands
behind
him
with
an
electrical
cord

opens
a
door
and
starts
to
push
him
through
it

nervous

the
attention
this
is
actually
a
new
category
first
time
ever
i
guess
there
were
a
lot
of
writein
ballots
and
um
the
prom
committee
asked
me
to
read
this
we're
not
good
friends
most
of
us
never
found
the
time
to
get
to
know
you
but
that
doesn't
mean
we
haven't
noticed
you
we
don't
talk
about
it
much
but
it's
no
secret
that
sunnydale
high
isn't
really
like
other
high
schools
a
lot
of
weird
stuff
happens
here
crowd
outbursts
zombies
hyena
people
snyder
jonathan
laughter
but
whenever
there
was
a
problem
or
something
creepy
happened
you
seemed
to
show
up
and
stop
it
most
of
the
people
here
have
been
saved
by
you
or
helped
by
you
at
one
time
or
another
we're
proud
to
say
that
the
class
of
'99
has
the
lowest
mortality
rate
of
any
graduating
class
in
sunnydale
history
jonathan
applause
from
the
crowd
and
we
know
at
least
part
of
that
is
because
of
you
so
the
senior
class
offers
its
thanks
and
gives
you
uh

giles
is
watching
the
dancing
and
wesley
approaches
him
mr
giles
i'd
like
your
opinion
while
the
last
thing
i
want
to
do
is
muddle
bad
behavior
in
front
of
impressionable
youth
i
wonder
if
asking
miss
chase
to
dance
would
for
god's
sake
man
she's
eighteen
and
you
have
the
emotional
maturity
of
a
blueberry
scone
just
have
at
it
would
you
and
stop
fluttering
about
giles
walks
away
right
then
thanks
for
that
cut
to
the
dance
floor
wesley
and
cordelia
begin
to
dance
pan
to
xander
and
anya
dancing
close
this
isn't
bad
cut
to
buffy
watching
the
dancers
giles
comes
up
behind
her
you
did
good
work
tonight

and
i
got
a
little
toy
surprise
i
had
no
idea
that
children
en
masse
could
be
gracious
every
now
and
then
people
surprise
you

looking
past
her
every
now
and
then
giles
takes
her
umbrella
and
leaves
buffy
turns
to
see
angel
at
the
door
they
meet
i
never
thought
you'd
come
it's
a
big
night
i
didn't
want
to
miss
