prologue

cut
to
a
forresty
area
see
a
guy
walking
along
he
pauses
as
a
branch
breaks
nearby
he
continues
walking
after
a
minute
he
turns
around
and
sees
buffy
oh
looking
for
me
holywhat
do
you
want
buffy
punches
him
the
guy
looks
startled
then
vamps
out
uhh
hey
look
who's
home
a
slayer
why
don't
you
just
go
back
where
you
came
from
things
were
great
before
you
came
buffy
punches
him
again
then
kicks
him
he
goes
down
and
as
he
gets
he
backhands
her
in
the
stomach
she
backhands
him
in
the
face
and
he
hits
the
ground
as
he's
getting
up
she
grabs
him
from
behind
and
stakes
him
and
they
say
one
person
can't
make
a
difference
then
pan
to
where
angel
can
be
seen
hiding
in
the
foliage
part
1

cut
to
a
lawn
outside
a
building
site
see
the
dean
on
a
podium
making
a
speech
there
is
a
small
gathering
watching
of
all
the
duties
of
a
dean
one
of
the
most
pleasant
is
to
see
a
colleague
realize
a
dream
ladies
gentlemen
students
i
present
to
you
professor
gerhardt
of
the
anthropology
department
prof
gerhardt
replaces
the
dean
at
the
podium
when
i
first
realized
we
were
outgrowing
our
current
cultural
center
i
was
concerned
then
i
realized
it
was
like
seeing
one's
child
grow
up
and
move
on
to
better
things
in
this
case
a
spacious
new
facility
to
be
built
on
this
site
cut
to
where
buffy
willow
and
anya
are
standing
together
xander
is
at
the
site
as
a
construction
worker
look
at
him
have
you
ever
seen
anything
so
masculine
you
mean
guerrero
or
his
wife
i
think
she
means
willow
referring
to
xander
who's
waiting
to
begin
digging
oh
very
manly
not
at
all
village
people
so
much
sexier
than
the
outfit
from
his
last
job
oh
i
miss
the
free
hot
dogs
on
sticks
i'm
imagining
having
sex
with
him
right
now
cut
back
to
gerhardt
continuing
her
speech
and
that's
why
it's
appropriate
that
the
groundbreaking
for
the
uc
sunnydale
cultural
partnership
center
is
taking
place
so
soon
before
thanksgiving
because
that's
what
the
melting
pot
is
about
contributions
from
all
cultures
making
our
culture
stronger
cut
to
the
girls
again
buffy
begins
to
clap
but
stops
as
willow
interjects
what
a
load
of
horse
hooey
we
have
a
counterpoint
yeah
thanksgiving
isn't
about
blending
of
2
cultures
it's
about
one
culture
wiping
out
another
and
then
they
make
animated
specials
about
the
part
where
with
the
maize
and
the
big
big
belt
buckles
they
don't
show
you
the
next
scene
where
all
the
bison
die
and
squanto
takes
a
musket
ball
in
the
stomach
ok
now
for
some
of
that
you
were
channeling
your
mother
well
yeah
sort
of
that's
why
she
doesn't
celebrate
thanksgiving
or
columbus
day
you
know
the
destruction
of
the
indigenous
peoples
i
know
it
sounds
a
little
overwrought
but
really
she'sshe's
right
yeah
i
guess
i
never
really
thought
about
it
that
way
with
mom
at
aunt
darlene's
this
year
i'm
not
getting
a
thanksgiving
maybe
it's
just
as
well
well
i
think
that's
a
shame
i
love
a
ritual
sacrifice
it's
not
really
a
one
of
those
to
commemorate
a
past
event
you
kill
and
eat
an
animal
it's
a
ritual
sacrifice
with
pie
cut
back
to
the
professor's
speech
and
thus
a
symbolic
beginning
she
goes
over
and
commences
with
the
groundbreaking
ceremony
anya
incensed
what's
she
doing
xander
said
he
was
going
to
dig
i
want
to
see
xander
dig
that's
part's
just
ceremonial
well
it
bites
she's
not
rippling
at
all
oh
look
there
he
goes
anya
sees
xander
begin
digging
in
earnest
she
sighs
look
at
him
verydiggy
soon
he'll
be
sweating
i'm
imagining
having
sex
with
him
again
imaginary
xander
is
quite
the
machine
xander
is
still
digging
when
suddenly
the
ground
breaks
away
beneath
him
he
plummets
to
an
underground
chamber
uhh
ow
i'm
ok
i'm
uh
i'm
ok
xander
looks
around
where
am
i
okay
angel
in
the
shadows
hiding
behind
trees
again
he's
staring
up
at
buffy's
window
cut
to
buffy
and
willow's
room
while
they
were
pulling
xander
out
i
heard
a
couple
of
the
anthro
professors
talking
about
it
man
were
they
excited
it's
the
old
sunnydale
mission
which
everyone
thought
was
lost
buffy
staring
out
the
window
huh
is
there
something
out
there
hmm
oh
no
i'm
sorry
a
lost
mission
i
mean
a
hairbrush
i
can
understand
and
by
the
way
i
will
find
that
and
get
that
back
to
you
but
how
do
you
lose
a
mission
huge
earthquake
in
1812
everyone
just
assumed
the
mission
was
leveled
instead
they
built
right
over
it
it's
like
what
happened
in
the
thirties
with
that
church
the
master
was
in
doesn't
it
make
you
wonder
what
else
is
there
like
right
under
our
feet
mostly
i've
just
found
sewers
full
of
demons
oh
right
outside
we
hear
students
running
mad
through
the
halls
with
excitement
man
it's
crazy
out
there
mmhmm
postmidterm
frenzy
and
the
holiday
everyone's
going
home
it
looks
like
a
lot
of
lucky
moms
are
gonna
be
getting
brimming
baskets
of
dirty
laundry
it's
so
not
fair
i
mean
they
all
get
a
family
holiday
just
because
they
can
go
home
to
their
families
hmm
it's
a
turvytopsy
world
you
know
what
i
should
have
my
own
thanksgiving
i
can
cook
the
meal
just
like
my
mom
does
have
all
you
guys
over
it'll
be
great
buffy
earlier
you
agreed
with
me
about
thanksgiving
it's
a
sham
it's
all
about
death
it
is
a
sham
but
it's
a
sham
with
yams
it's
a
yam
sham
you're
not
gonna
jokeyrhyme
your
way
out
of
this
one
i
know
but
i
want
it
it's
like
professor
walsh
was
saying
about
sense
memory
i
smell
a
roasting
turkey
and
i'm
8
years
old
i
liked
having
that
to
look
forward
to
everything's
different
now
well
i
suppose
there
could
be
slight
yams
i
mean
we
could
definitely
use
a
little
comfort
food
i
bet
giles
doesn't
have
any
plans
and
xander
always
tries
to
avoid
all
of
his
family
gatherings
ooh
we
could
not
invite
anya
i
don't
know
she
and
xander
seem
pretty
tight
lately
look
pilgrims
aside
isn't
that
the
whole
point
of
thanksgiving
everybody
has
a
place
to
go
cut
to
spike
walking
around
the
forrest
wearing
a
blanket
looking
desolate
cut
to
riley
graham
and
forrest
in
commando
gear
patrolling
the
forrest
looking
for
spike
man
i'm
beat
we'll
do
one
more
sweep
then
cash
it
in
i
gotta
pack
tonight
you
got
a
flight
wednesday
night
professor
walsh
wants
me
here
for
the
debriefing
that's
a
pretty
short
thanksgiving
hey
with
a
hostile
on
the
loose
we're
lucky
to
be
going
home
at
all
it's
neutered
the
implant
works
great
he
can't
hurt
a
single
living
thing
as
long
as
he
knows
about
the
initiative
he's
a
threat
we
do
this
the
professor's
way
forrest
coughing
the
words
mama's
boy
that's
a
nasty
cough
you
might
need
to
spend
the
weekend
in
quarantine
oh
no
i'm
done
coughing
i
just
don't
want
anyone
getting
sick
riley
pats
forrest
on
the
arm
cut
to
xander's
basementroom
anya
comes
in
as
xander
is
finishing
dressing
for
work
he
looks
worn
out
xander
what
are
you
doing
you're
supposed
to
be
digging
i
went
to
watch
you
digging
and
you
weren't
there
doing
it
i'm
going
now
justkinda
tough
getting
going
today
anya
feeling
his
forehead
your
head
is
moist
oh
you're
sick
well
you
can't
go
to
work
anya
pushes
him
back
on
the
bed
uh
oh
anya
you're
pasty
and
wet
and
disgusting
they
can
dig
without
you
xander
groaning
look
i
don't
really
feel
that
bad
i
inflicted
a
lot
of
putrefying
diseases
on
men
when
i
was
an
avenging
demon
and
you
look
like
you're
getting
all
of
them
xander
giving
in
ok
i'll
stay
but
you
should
go
you
could
catch
it
anya
perkily
we'll
die
together
it's
romantic
let
me
get
your
trousers
off
anya
begins
to
undress
him
you're
a
strange
girlfriend
i'm
a
girlfriend
uhthere's
a
chance
i'm
delirious
ah
yes
well
whatever
it
is
that's
making
you
sick
so
far
i
like
it
cut
to
the
professor
gerhardt
on
the
phone
it's
a
very
exciting
opportunity
i
can't
wait
to
go
down
there
myself
it's
justwell
it's
means
we're
going
to
have
to
start
looking
for
a
new
location
no
it's
really
up
to
the
dean
i
just
hope
this
doesn't
cost
us
another
year
ok
talk
to
you
later
see
green
smoke
coalescing
around
an
ancient
knife
the
professor
inspects
it
and
the
smoke
turns
into
a
native
american
he
grabs
the
knife
seizes
the
professor
and
slits
her
throat
part
2

willow
and
buffy
are
inspecting
the
site
of
the
professor's
death
i'll
never
get
used
to
this
one
day
she's
at
the
friendship
ceremony
the
next
day
she's
on
the
news
the
coroner's
office
said
she
was
missing
an
ear
so
i'm
thinking
maybe
we're
looking
for
a
witch
there's
some
great
spells
that
work
much
better
with
an
ear
in
the
mix
that's
one
fun
little
hobby
you've
got
there
will
oror
maybe
an
earharvesting
demon
thatit's
like
building
another
demon
completely
out
of
ears
orooh
thought
we're
just
assuming
someone
else
cut
off
the
ear
what
if
it
was
selfinflicted
like
van
gogh
soshe
brutally
stabs
herself
dumped
the
body
then
cut
off
her
own
ear
no
she
cut
off
her
ear
then
killed
herself
then
dumped
the
body
i'm
really
off
my
game
aren't
i
yeah
wait
something's
missing
from
this
case
buffy
reads
the
inscription
early
1800
chumash
knife
there's
a
picture
what's
it
look
like
cut
to
buffy
in
giles
kitchen
getting
the
food
ready
for
thanksgiving
dinner
pretty
darn
scary
it
more
like
a
riot
than
a
ralph's
i
thought
i
was
going
to
have
to
use
slayer
moves
on
this
one
woman
who
was
completely
hoarding
the
pumpkin
pie
filling
and
at
some
point
you
are
going
to
tell
me
about
the
murder
oh
right
the
knife
was
some
sort
of
indian
artifact
chumash
i
think
that's
all
we
got
oh
chumash
indians
they
were
indigenous
to
this
whole
area
that's
interesting
then
of
course
the
murder
weapon
might
have
just
been
a
convenient
choice
uhuh
there
was
a
big
ol'
scissors
lying
right
there
that
knife
was
picked
for
a
reason
do
you
even
own
a
turkey
pan
tell
me
again
why
we're
not
doing
this
at
your
house
giles
if
you
would
like
to
get
by
in
american
society
then
you
are
going
to
have
to
follow
our
traditions
you're
the
patriarch
you
have
to
host
the
festivities
or
it's
all
meaningless
and
this
is
in
no
way
an
elaborate
scheme
to
stick
me
with
the
cleanup
how
about
that
ceremonial
knife
huh
pretty
juicy
piece
of
clueage
don't
you
think
yes
all
right
i'll
look
into
the
chumash
connection
and
see
if
there's
any
ritual
significance
to
the
ear
removal
thank
you
buffy
pauses
looking
lost
in
thought
you
all
right
yeah
uh
i
still
need
to
pick
up
a
few
things
so
i'll
check
in
and
keep
your
hands
off
the
food
oh
i'll
try
and
restrain
myself
from
eating
uncooked
potatoes
and
cranberries
buffy
leaves
and
angel
walks
out
from
a
room
in
the
back
of
the
apartment
so
what
do
you
think
she
sounds
good
kind
of
intense
about
this
thanksgiving
thing
i
think
perhaps
she's
a
little
lonely
but
i
meant
about
the
murder
whatever
killed
the
woman
in
the
museum
that's
probably
the
danger
yeah
well
this
danger
your
friend
has
some
ominous
vision
about
buffy
it's
all
terribly
vague
i
mean
there
are
other
things
happening
on
this
campus
well
maybe
i'm
wrong
but
i
gotta
try
something
i
can't
just
keep
watching
i'm
glad
that
you're
watching
out
for
her
but
i
feel
i
should
remind
you
that
she's
not
helpless
and
it's
not
your
job
to
keep
her
safe
it's
not
yours
anymore
either
are
you
going
to
walk
away
all
right
but
i
feel
we
should
tell
her
i
don't
like
keeping
this
secret
no
if
she
knew
i
was
here
it
was
distract
her
it
could
get
her
hurt
i
don't
want
to
get
in
the
way
um
i'm
assuming
that
there's
some
connection
to
the
old
mission
something
is
angry
about
being
disturbed
or
maybe
it
was
trapped
there
and
now
it's
released
something
that
has
a
fondness
for
ancient
weapons
you
know
father
gabriel
no
he
knows
the
history
of
this
place
pretty
well
his
family
dates
back
to
mission
times
he
might
be
able
to
fill
in
some
blanks
ok
well
i'll
see
about
contacting
him
where
are
you
going
to
watch
her
it's
not
fair
you
know
that's
what
she'd
say
you
can
see
her
but
she
can't
see
you
believe
me
i'm
not
getting
the
good
half
of
this
deal
to
be
on
the
outside
looking
in
at
what
i
can't
well
i'd
forgotten
how
bad
it
feels
cut
to
willow
and
buffy
walking
along
outside
in
the
business
district
but
you
have
whipped
cream
i
saw
it
in
giles'
fridge
but
that's
whipped
cream
in
a
canister
look
it's
only
right
if
you
whip
it
yourself
hey
and
then
later
we
can
churn
our
own
butter
and
make
sweaters
out
of
sheep
ok
it's
the
last
thing
i
promise
besides
i
have
an
appointment
with
that
priest
that
giles
called
about
he
thinks
he
might
have
some
information
riley
runs
up
to
them
buffy
hey
buffy
riley
where'd
you
come
from
i
didn't
see
you

all
oh
just

a
couple
of
blocks
down

just
gonna
let
you
two
look

selling
coffee

the
coffee
shop

into
the
coffee
shop
and
into
angel
he
grabs
her
and
covers
her
mouth
with
his
hand
she's
trying
to
talk
through
it
and
it
comes
out
garbled
oh

a
vision

in
danger

sees
me

be

window

sees
buffy
and
riley
chatting
who's
that
guy
cut
to
outside
where
buffy
and
riley
are
talking

be
just
like
it
was
when
i
was
a
kid
only
without
me
building
a
fort
out
of
my
mashed
potatoes

outside
of
a
church

buffy
walking
around

gabriel
father
gabriel
buffy
goes
through
a
set
of
double
doors
father

here
buffy
sees
the
indian
in
the
middle
of
slicing
the
throat
of
the
priest
he's
hung
god
buffy
runs
the
rest
of
the
way
to
the
indian
and
punches
him
in
the
stomach
she
then
redirects
him
a
few
feet
away
he
gets
up
to
a
defensive
crouch
in
a
fighting
stance
you
can't
stop
me
you're
very
wrong
about
that
he
rushes
her
again
but
she
sidesteps
him
and
redirects
him
forward
which
makes
him
slam
his
head
into
a
conveniently
low
hung
bell
he
lands
a
few
feet
back
gets
up
and
tries
to
slice
buffy
with
his
knife
she
dodges
back
again
he
tries
to
punch
her
and
she
dodges
making
him
hit
an
ornamental
stand
yaugh
they
fall
and
he
is
on
top
of
her
wielding
a
knife
i
am
vengeance
i
am
my
people's
cry
they
call
for
hus
for
the
avenging
spirit
to
carve
out
justice
they
tell
you
to
start
an
ear
collection
buffy
kicks
high
which
throws
him
off
she
rolls
over
punching
him
then
slams
his
knife
arm
into
a
tree
but
he
doesn't
let
go
he
punches
her
but
she
kicks
the
legs
out
from
under
him
she
grabs
him
and
he's
stuck
holding
his
knife
to
his
throat
you
slaughtered
my
people
now
you
kill
their
spirit
this
is
a
great
day
for
you
she
shoves
him
away
and
he
gets
up
then
he
turns
into
a
group
of
bats
and
they
fly
off
part
3

cut
to
buffy
and
giles
in
his
kitchen
again
they're
back
to
getting
dinner
ready
buffy's
checking
the
settings
on
the
stove
and
giles
peeling
vegetables
in
the
sink
it's
clear
we're
dealing
with
a
spirit
of
some
kind
it's
very
common
for
indian
spirits
to
change
to
animal
form
it's
plenty
uncommon
for
me
to
freeze
up
during
a
fight
i
mean
i
had
the
guy
i
was
ready
for
the
takedown
and
i
stopped
and
native
american
sorry
we
don't
say
indian
oh
right
yes
yes
um
always
behind
on
the
terms
still
trying
not
to
refer
to
you
lot
as
bloody
colonials
and
the
thing
is
i
like
my
evil
like
i
like
my
men
evil
you
know
straight
up
black
hat
tied
to
the
train
tracks
soon
my
electroray
will
destroy
metropolis
bad
not
all
mixed
up
with
guilt
and
the
destruction
of
an
indigenous
culture
this
spirit
warrior
hus
you
called
him
has
killed
innocent
people
ok
you
know
what
we
need
to
boil
those
and
put
them
through
the
ricer
i
don't
think
i
have
a
ricer
you
don't
have
a
ricer
what
do
you
mean
how
could
someone
not
have
a
ricer
well
do
you
have
one
at
home
i
don't
know
what's
a
ricer
we'll
mash
them
with
forks
much
like
the
pilgrims
must
have
did
you
catch
the
part
about
the
innocent
people
yes
ok
and
i
do
want
to
stop
him
i'd
just
like
to
find
a
nonslayee
way
to
do
it
there's
a
knock
at
the
door
buffy
opens
it
and
see
willow
standing
with
a
huge
pile
of
books
hey
hey
peas
peas
buffy
takes
the
small
box
of
peas
leaving
willow
to
struggle
with
a
mound
of
books
these
are
frozen
what's
all
that
atrocities
i
got
the
full
poop
on
the
chumash
indians
and
our
fabulous
buried
mission
you
said
you
were
going
to
get
fresh
ones
atrocities
peas
they
come
in
little
pods
you
were
going
to
shell
them
i
didn't
have
time
i
was
busy
reading
about
the
chumash
war
the
chumash
were
peaceful
oh
they
were
peaceful
all
right
they
were
fluffy
indigenous
kittens
till
we
came
along
they're
gonna
be
mushy
they
won't
be
mushy
i
like
mushy
peas
you're
the
reason
we
had
to
have
pilgrims
in
the
first
place
so
what
happened
to
the
chumash
how
about
imprisonment
forced
labor
herded
like
animals
into
a
mission
full
of
bad
european
diseases
boy
cultural
partnership
center
really
didn't
stress
any
of
that
stuff
not
even
a
diorama
and
it
gets
better
the
few
chumash
who
tried
to
rebel
were
hanged
and
when
a
group
was
accused
of
stealing
cattle
they
were
killed
men
women
and
children
and
for
proof
to
bring
back
to
their
accusers
they
cut
off
their
ears
so
hus
wasn't
kidding
about
the
rightful
vengeance
routine
he's
recreating
all
the
wrongs
done
to
his
people
and
it's
up
to
us
to
stop
him
yes
but
after
dinner
right
are
you
sure
we
shouldn't
be
helping
him
no
i
think
perhaps
we
won't
help
the
angry
spirit
with
his
rape
and
pillage
and
murder
well
ok
no
but
we
should
be
helping
him
redress
his
wrongs
bring
the
atrocities
to
light
if
the
history
books
are
full
of
them
i'd
say
they
already
are
giving
his
land
back
it's
not
exactly
ours
to
give
i
don't
think
you
wanna
help
i
think
you
just
wanna
slay
the
demon
then
go
la
la
la
and
i
think
your
sympathy
for
his
plight
has
blinded
you
to
certain
urgent
facts
we
have
to
stop
this
thing
ok
unfeeling
guy
willow
that's
not
fair
buffy
running
to
the
kitchen
i
have
to
baste
willow
i
giles
in
hushed
tones
i
have
reason
to
believe
buffy
herself
may
be
in
particular
danger
from
this
menace
you
mean
angel
i
saw
him
too
that's
not
terribly
stealthy
of
him
i
think
he's
lost
his
edge
but
buffy
doesn't
know
oh
no
not
a
peep
well
that's
good
but
this
is
why
i
think
we
should
all
keep
a
level
head
in
this
and
i
happen
to
think
mine
is
the
level
head
and
yours
is
the
one
things
would
roll
off
of
there
is
another
knock
at
the
door
giles
opens
it
and
anya
and
xander
are
there
happy
thanksgiving
xander
you
look
like
death
are
you
ok
you
didn't
bring
rolls
xander
and
anya
walk
in
xander
lays
on
the
couch
and
anya
tends
to
them
the
doctor
couldn't
figure
out
was
up
with
me
he
said
i
had
a
lot
of
symptoms
that
didn't
connect
i
think
they
do
connect
what
to
this
chumash
spirit
vengeance
guy
didn't
you
say
the
chumash
got
all
diseased
when
they
were
all
holed
up
in
the
mission
yeah
this
has
a
better
account
of
everything
it
lists
the
various
various
as
in
well
the
important
thing
is
not
to
panic
you
just
recited
the
mystical
paniccausing
incantation
so
little
hope
there
let's
talk
about
the
various
well
they
did
suffer
from
malaria
some
smallpox
i
was
gonna
say
smallpox
willow
softly
mumbles
you
know
syphilis
but
basically
xander
in
shock
syphilis
well
but
this
is
probably
mystical
and
it'll
all
go
away
as
soon
as
as
soon
as
what
we
still
don't
know
what
we're
gonna
do
well
maybe
i
can
find
something
let's
give
him
some
land
i'm
sure
that'll
clear
everything
right
up
sarcasm
accomplishes
nothing
giles
it's
sort
of
an
end
in
itself
can
we
come
rocketing
back
to
the
part
about
me
and
my
new
syphilis
anya
stroking
his
forehead
it'll
make
you
blind
and
insane
but
it
won't
kill
you
the
smallpox
will
maybe
there's
a
wiccan
spell
that
can
cure
it
something
regular
medicine
doesn't
know
ooh
there
was
a
potion
willow
looks
through
a
book
and
pulls
out
a
piece
of
paper
and
begins
reading
sage
saltonion
that's
the
stuffing
oh
god
uh
you're
gonna
get
vesicles
and
pustules
they
have
pictures
anya
tries
to
show
him
the
book
i
hate
this
guy
he's
just
doing
what
was
done
to
him
i
didn't
give
him
syphilis
no
but
you
freed
his
spirit
and
after
a
century
of
unrest
he
saw
you
as
one
of
his
oppressors
what
so
he
rises
up
and
infects
the
first
guy
he
sees
that's
no
fair
like
you've
never
woken
up
cranky
but
why
the
others
why
them
particularly
so
we
take
this
guy
out
buffy
it
is
for
to
be
slaying
sometime
soon
yeah
buffy
looking
up
from
her
stirring
that's
sort
of
the
question
before
the
court
question
there
are
2
sides
to
it
slaying
him
the
representative
from
syphilis
votes
yea
it's
not
that
simple
he's
a
vengeance
demon
you
don't
talk
to
vengeance
demons
you
kill
them
anya
drawing
back
i
didn't
know
you
felt
that
way
xander
totally
confused
what
anyway
he's
a
spirit
not
a
demon
yes
and
we've
never
faced
this
sort
of
spirit
before
we
really
don't
know
what
will
kill
it
again
with
the
killing
figuratively
speaking
or
bind
it
or
whatever
yes
willow
we
all
appreciate
your
perspective
sometimes
vengeance
is
justified
you
know
that
i
didn't
mean
you
i
don't
think
anyone
appreciates
the
truth
of
the
situation
oh
i
think
we
do
buffy
getting
up
abruptly
holding
the
bowl
this
is
no
good
it
needs
more
condensed
milk
buffy
flees
into
the
kitchen
buffy
xander's
in
real
danger
are
you
sure
the
solution
is
pie
buffy
adding
more
condensed
milk
over
bickering
and
confusion
i'll
take
pie
we
will
find
a
solution
and
we
will
have
a
nice
dinner
ok
both
end
of
story
i'm
having
thanksgiving
and
it'll
be
perfect
hus
won't
stop
vengeance
is
never
sated
buffy
hatred
is
a
cycle
all
he
will
do
is
kill
there's
a
knock
at
the
door
buffy
goes
to
answer
it
and
spike
is
standing
there
cowering
below
a
blanket
smoke
rises
as
he's
being
seared
by
the
indirect
sun
help
me
buffy
shoves
him
back
and
he
goes
tumbling
ohh
what
part
of
help
me
do
you
not
understand
the
part
where
i
help
you
come
on
i'm
parboiling
out
here
giles
hands
her
a
stake
want
me
to
help
make
it

did
you
said
you
were

part
and
get
to
the
part
where
i
couldn't
bite
you
it's
true

trouble
performing
yeah
well
it
looks
like
they've
done
me
for
good
um

saying
that
spike
had
a
little
trip

in
and
you
killed
them
and
you
took
their
land
that's
what
conquering
nations
do
it's
what
caesar
did
and
he's
not
going
around
saying
i
came
i
conquered
i
felt
really
bad
about
it
the
history
of
the
world
isn't
people
making
friends
you
had
better
weapons
and
you
massacred
them
end
of
story
well
i
think
the
spaniards
actually
did
a
lot
of
not
that
i
don't
like
spaniards
listen
to
you
how
you
gonna
fight
anyone
with
that
attitude
we
don't
wanna
fight
anyone
i
just
wanna
have
thanksgiving
heh
heh
yeahgood
luck
if
we
could
talk
to
him
you
exterminated
his
race
what
could
you
possibly
say
that
would
make
him
feel
better
it's
kill
or
be
killed
here
take
your
bloody
pick
maybe
it's
the
syphilis
talking
but
some
of
that
made
sense
i
made
these
points
earlier
but
fine
no
one
listens
to
me
fine
ok
but
someone
still
has
to
go
warn
the
dean
i'll
go
i
need
the
air
not
alone
i'll
go
me
too
sure
you're
up
to
it
oh
leave
that
one
he
looks
like

can
eat
someone
if
he's
already
dead
xander
getting
up

up
to
it

keep
on
looking
for
a
solution
yeah

dean's
house
is
up
past
the
gym
and
hurry
dinner's

an
hour
hey

i
get
fed
later
i
hope
the
others
are
ok
you
know
what
happens
to
vampires
who
don't
get
to
feed
i
always
wondered
that
giles
plates
living
skeletons

like
famine
pictures

those
dusty
countries

not
half
as
funny
you
can
have
gravy

you
know
what
else
has
blood
in
it
blood

i
have
to
gag
you
because
i
am
not
gonna
listen
to
you
whine
all
the
way
through
my
dinner
it's
gonna
be
a
nice
quiet
civilized
suddenly
an
arrow
pierces
the
decorative
scarecrow
on
the
table
we
see
hus
in
the
window
with
a
bow
and
arrow
you

i
wasn't
clear

how
terrible
we
all
feel
'cause
we're
trying
to
help
what's
going
on
it
isn't
working
uh

can
have
casinos
now

down
giles
and
buffy
crouch
behind
the
table
as
arrows
rain
through
the
window
what
about
me

right
of
his
heart

xander

his

you
hus
turns
into
a
large
bear
a
bear
you
made
a
bear
i
didn't
mean
to
undo
it
undo
it
hey
gentle
ben
over
here
xander
starts
throwing
food
at
him
that's
for
giving
me
syphilis
buffy
stabs
the
bear
in
the
back
as
he's
distracted
by
xander
what
happened
did
we
win
everyone
is
gathered
around
the
table
eating
i
feel
lousy
turkey
came
out
rather
splendidly
oh
it
was
yummy
it's
justdid
you
see
me
2
seconds
of
conflict
with
an
indigenous
person
and
i
turned
into
general
custer
violence
does
that
instinct
takes
over
yeah
that's
the
fun
nobody
asked
you
oh
lay
off
you
all
had
a
fine
meal
but
mean
entire
siege
you'd
think
one
of
you
would
bleed
a
little
good
work
buffy
on
both
counts
thanks
well
you
know
you
should
be
very
pleased
wasn't
exactly
a
perfect
thanksgiving
i
don't
know
seemed
kinda
right
to
me
a
bunch
of
anticipation
a
big
fight
and
now
we're
all
sleepy
and
we
did
all
survive
i
guess
that
much
is
true
first
thanksgiving
on
my
own
and
we
all
got
through
it
xander
patting
anya
on
the
shoulder
and
you
know
what
i
think
my
syphilis
is
clearing
right
up
and
they
say
romance
is
dead
or
maybe
they
just
wish
it
well
maybe
we
started
a
new
tradition
this
year
willow
gets
a
look
from
everyone
maybe
not
but
at
least
we
all
worked
together
it
was
like
old
times
yeah
especially
with
angel
being
here
and
everything
everyone
looks
at
buffy
