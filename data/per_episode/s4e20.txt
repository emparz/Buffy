prologue

fade
in
close
up
of
a
widescreen
monitor
a
whitehaired
man
in
a
suit
is
sitting
behind
a
desk
the
office
he's
in
is
dark
and
the
reflection
of
colonel
mcnamara
is
seen
on
the
glass
of
the
monitor
and
the
men
these
are
exceptional
boys
their
capture
ratio
just
keeps
increasing
they're
keeping
it
together
morale's
a
problem
the
death
of
professor
walsh
the
escape
of
the
prototype
controlling
the
hsts
is
getting
harder
we
have
serious
overcrowding
in
the
containment
areas
as
he
spoke
the
camera
has
slowly
panned
away
from
the
monitor
to
the
colonel
we
can
see
he
is
standing
in
some
kind
of
communications
center
in
the
initiative
there
is
a
large
world
map
on
one
wall
he
is
the
only
one
there
quite
a
mess
it's
not
my
mess
sir
i'm
just
holding
the
fort
while
you
figure
out
what
you
want
to
do
with
the
place
this
incident
with
finn
was
unfortunate
fell
in
with
a
bad
crowd
quite
frankly
i
don't
think
he
was
ever
the
soldier
that
you
all
hoped
he
was
boy
thinks
too
much
nevertheless
we
want
him
back
the
government's
invested
a
sub
we'll
catch
up
to
him
my
feeling
is
he
won't
stray
too
far
from
the
girl
yes
uh
mr
ward
puts
on
reading
glasses
to
look
at
something
on
his
desk
buffy
summers
mr
ward
removes
glasses
our
data
banks
don't
have
much
on
her
she's
just
a
girl
cut
to
spike
spike
sighs
she's
a
lot
more
than
that
he
is
in
a
chamber
underground
in
the
sewers
light
reflecting
off
water
is
shimmering
on
the
wall
behind
him
as
he
walks
across
the
room
the
slayer's
dangerous
is
all
i'm
saying
camera
tracks
spike
until
we
see
adam
standing
in
front
of
a
computer
setup
this
is
his
hideout
adam
is
sliding
a
disk
into
the
drive
slot
in
the
metal
plate
covering
his
left
pectoral
yes
she
makes
things
interesting
spike
walks
up
to
him
no
see
you're
not
getting
it
mr
bits
you're
gonna
be
interestingly
dead
spike
paces
again
little
miss
tiny's
got
a
habit
of
bollixing
up
the
plans
of
every
wouldbe
unstoppable
badass
who
sets
foot
in
this
town
he
stops
to
face
adam
just
want
you
to
know
when
the
big
ugly
goes
down
the
slayer's
gonna
be
right
in
the
thick
of
it
you
ready
for
that
i'm
counting
on
it
wolf's
howl
buffy
theme
and
opening
credits
roll
part
one

fade
in
close
up
of
a
zippo
in
spike's
hand
he
flips
the
lid
open
with
his
thumb
and
strikes
the
flame
he
brings
the
lighter
up
to
the
cigarette
in
his
mouth
two
slayers
spike
closing
the
lighter
that's
right
cut
to
wider
shot
adam
is
now
pacing
the
chamber
spike
is
sitting
back
in
an
old
beatup
couch
stuffing
sticking
out
in
large
patches
and
you
killed
them
both
spike
grinning
yeah
i
killed
the
hell
out
of
them
yet
you
fear
this
one
spike
offended
hey
watch
it
mate
i
don't
fear
anything
just
know
my
enemies
do
you
then
why
haven't
you
killed
this
slayer
yet
because
spike
trails
off
stinking
rotten
luck
is
why
on
top
of
that
now
i
got
this
buggering
chip
up
my
head
yes
your
behavior
modification
circuitry
i
know
what
you
feel
spike
scoffs
softly
not
likely
adam
stands
in
front
of
him
you
feel
smothered
trapped
like
an
animal
pure
in
its
ferocity
unable
to
actualize
the
urges
within
clinging
to
one
truth
like
a
flame
struggling
to
burn
within
an
enclosed
glass
that
a
beast
this
powerful
cannot
be
contained
inevitably
it
will
break
free
and
savage
the
land
again
i
will
make
you
whole
again
make
you
savage
moved
spike
has
to
blink
back
tears
spike
awed
wow
spike
composes
himself
i
mean
yeah
i
get
why
the
demons
all
fall
in
line
with
you
spike
sits
up
you're
like
tony
robbins
if
he
was
a
big
scary
frankenstein
looking
spike
reconsiders
you're
exactly
like
tony
robbins
i
will
restore
you
to
what
you
once
were
when
i
have
the
slayer
how
and
where
i
want
her
spike
sighs
easier
said
she's
crafty
her
and
her
little
friends
friends
there's
your
what
do
you
call
it
variable
the
slayer's
got
pals
you
want
her
evening
the
odds
in
a
fight
you
don't
want
the
slayerettes
mucking
about
take
them
away
from
her
spike
perks
up
at
that
idea
now
there's
a
plan
she's
working
solo
she
won't
have
a
chance
to
come
after
us
when
the
wild
rumpus
begins
spike
chuckles
plus
it
will
make
her
miserable
and
i
never
get
tired
of
that
he
sits
back
again
he
smiles
at
that
prospect
spike
to
himself
yeah
leave
'em
to
me
you
can't
hurt
them
what
can
you
do
to
make
sure
they're
out
of
the
picture
not
a
blessed
thing
they're
gonna
do
it
for
me
he
brings
his
cigarette
to
his
lips
and
as
he
takes
a
drag
cut
to
stevenson
hall
room
214
the
room
is
dark
the
door
opens
and
buffy
enters
switching
on
the
light
she
is
still
wearing
the
clothes
we
saw
her
in
when
she
was
in
la
to
see
angel
sanctuary
as
she
closes
the
door
she
sees
willow's
bed
which
looks
as
if
it
hasn't
been
slept
in
for
quite
sometime
she
tiredly
rubs
a
hand
over
her
face
and
crosses
the
room
to
lay
on
her
own
bed
she
doesn't
close
her
eyes
and
there
is
a
forlorn
look
on
her
face
cut
to
exterior
shot
of
the
ruins
of
sunnydale
high
school
cut
to
interior
of
one
of
the
burnt
out
hallways
amidst
the
debris
we
see
the
small
camp
riley
had
set
up
in
the
last
episode
a
lantern
is
the
only
source
of
light
aside
from
streams
of
moonlight
shining
through
holes
in
the
ceiling
it
looks
like
he's
been
there
for
a
while
xander
is
there
with
a
backpack
on
his
shoulder
do
you
know
if
she's
back
yet
la
woman
haven't
heard
from
her
she'll
probably
come
here
first
thing
though
hey
who's
your
buddy
xander
swings
the
backpack
from
his
shoulder
and
tosses
it
to
riley
so
you
don't
have
to
be
gi
joe
while
your
civvies
are
getting
washed
riley
pulls
out
a
pair
of
really
baggy
pants
with
a
blue
and
white
confetti
pattern
try
those
on
you'll
feel
like
a
new
man
would
this
man
have
a
bright
red
nose
and
big
floppy
feet
perturbed
xander
purses
his
lips
and
raises
his
eyebrows
hey
i'm
sorry
that's
the
cabin
fever
talking
xander
looks
the
place
over
but
as
postapocalypsesplendor
goes
i've
done
wonders
with
the
place
yeah
still
the
sooner
buffy
gets
back
the
better
i'll
feel
riley
sits
down
on
his
sleeping
bag
his
back
against
the
blackened
wall
you
and
me
both
big
guy
i
take
it
you're
not
an
angel
fan
either
well
it's
not
like
i
hate
the
guy
just
you
know
the
guts
part
of
him
can't
blame
you
but
to
be
fair
it's
not
him
you
hate
it's
the
curse
xander
doesn't
respond
right
what
did
buffy
tell
you
xander
sits
down
on
the
cooler
on
angel
everything
more
than
i
wanted
to
know
sometimes
she
loved
him
he
turned
evil
he
uh
killed
people
she
cured
him
he
left
interesting
little
curse
one
moment's
happiness
what
do
you
mean
you
know
it's
his
trigger
angel's
an
okay
guy
if
he's
mopey
and
sad
and
brooding
but
if
you
give
him
even
one
second
of
pure
real
pleasure
and
that
sets
him
off
only
in
the
big
ol
kill
your
friends
kind
of
way
and
you
know
what
makes
angel
happiest
i'll
give
you
a
hint
it
not
creme
brulee
riley
doesn't
say
anything
for
a
couple
of
seconds
buffy
xander
nods
opening
his
palms
in
a
there
you
go
gesture
riley
dwells
on
this
for
a
moment
and
it
dawns
on
him
sex
riley
scoffs
softly
with
buffy
xander's
jaw
drops
as
he
realizes
she
kind
of
left
that
part
out
huh
yeah
she
did
that
explains
a
lot
of
things
that
i
wish
weren't
explained
hey
man
that's
all
ancient
history
riley
scoffs
she
went
running
to
la
to
bone
up
on
her
history
no
i'm
sure
it's
boneless
she
just
needs
to
make
sure
everything's
okay
she's
probably
back
already
maybe
you'll
feel
a
lot
better
when
you
see
her
but
riley
doesn't
look
so
sure
i
guess
we'll
see
cut
to
exterior
of
giles'
apartment
building
giles
singing
if
i
leave
here
tomorrow

cut
to
giles'
apartment
he
is
sitting
on
the
side
of
his
sofa
playing
freebird
on
his
guitar
giles
singing
would
you
still
remember
me

camera
pans
slowly
around
him
giles
singing
well
i
must
be
traveling
on
now
there's
too
many
places
i've
got
to
see

giles
singing
and
if
i
stay
here
with
you
girl
things
just
couldn't
be
the
same

giles
singing
'cause
i'm
as
free
as
bird
now
giles
highpitched
gasp
he
jumps
up
from
the
couch
as
he's
startled
to
see
spike
standing
in
his
home
the
vampire
starts
heading
for
the
kitchen
you
know
for
someone
who's
got
watcher
on
his
resume'
you
might
want
to
cast
an
eye
to
the
front
door
every
now
and
again
giles
has
removed
his
glasses
and
looks
peeved
he
rounds
the
sofa
and
stands
at
the
entrance
of
the
hallway
as
spike
opens
the
refrigerator
what
do
you
want
ah
spike
he
takes
out
a
transfusion
blood
bag
knew
i
left
one
spike
closes
fridge
buffy
around
why
giles
moves
in
front
of
the
bar
as
spike
pops
the
plastic
bag
into
the
microwave
and
turns
it
on
i
need
to
speak
to
the
lady
of
the
house
hey
be
a
pet
and
give
her
a
message
for
me
would
you
tell
her
i
just
might
have
something
she
just
might
want
and
what
might
that
something
be
spike
regards
him
with
little
importance
information
highly
classified
not
cheap
wordonthestreet
prattle
either
i'm
talking
about
the
good
stuff
now
unimpressed
giles
sits
on
one
of
the
stools
and
puts
his
glasses
back
on
he
crosses
his
arms
thrill
me
spike
sighs
it's
nothing
i
know
what
you
think
i'd
come
running
over
saying
i've
got
a
secret
beat
me
till
i
talk
there's
files
in
the
initiative
i'm
pretty
sure
i
know
where
giles'
interest
is
perked
the
microwave
beeps
files
spike
taking
out
the
bag
yeah
secrets
he
bites
open
a
corner
of
the
bag
grabs
a
coffee
mug
and
starts
to
pour
the
blood
mission
statements
design
schematics
all
of
maggie
walsh's
dirty
laundry
which
i
guess
would
include
lots
of
tidbits
about
giles
removing
glasses
adam
well
yeah
say
someone
were
to
risk
his
life
and
limb
well
limb
anyway
to
obtain
said
files
it
might
be
worth
a
little
something
spike
lifts
the
mug
to
his
mouth
and
drains
it
aat
this
point
a
cynical
person
might
think
that
you're
offering
just
what
we
need
when
we
need
it
most
that
person'd
be
right
rupert
supply
and
demand
and
it
won't
be
cheap
this
time
what
do
you
want
spike
seems
to
think
about
it
as
he
sets
the
mug
down
next
to
the
sink
hmm
year
supply
of
blood
guaranteed
protection
merry
bushels
of
cash
and
most
important
a
guarantee
that
i'm
not
to
be
in
anyway
slain
giles
puts
on
glasses
done
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
from
you
sorry
not
close
to
good
enough
this
deal's
with
the
slayer
i'll
tell
her
oh
you'll
tell
her
great
comfort
that
what
makes
you
think
she'll
listen
to
you
because
giles
trails
off
unsure
very
convincing
i'm
her
watcher
i
think
you're
neglecting
the
pasttense
there
rupert
besides
she
barely
listened
to
you
when
you
were
in
charge
i've
seen
the
way
she
treats
you
giles
grows
uncomfortable
at
those
words
he
grabs
a
bottle
off
the
bar
and
starts
to
pour
himself
a
drink
oh
yes
and
how's
that
very
much
like
a
retired
librarian
giles
doesn't
say
anything
and
continues
to
pour
look
i've
got
what
she
wants
as
long
as
she
has
what
i
want
he
walks
out
of
the
kitchen
and
heads
for
the
door
as
he
passes
giles
spread
the
word
she
knows
where
to
find
me
giles
softly
without
authority
i'll
think
about
it
the
front
door
closes
and
giles
brings
the
glass
to
his
lips
cut
to
tara's
dorm
room
willow
is
sitting
on
the
bed
playing
with
a
small
black
and
white
kitten
in
her
lap
tara
is
sitting
on
the
large
chest
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
she
is
looking
though
the
course
selection
booklet
oh
i
keep
thinking
okay
that's
the
cutest
thing
ever
and
then
she
does
something
cuter
and
completely
resets
the
whole
scale
did
you
see
her
yawn
earlier
yes
i
thought
i
was
going
to
die
willow
picks
up
the
kitten
to
look
into
its
eyes
willow
babying
voice
oh
i
love
you
miss
kitty
fantastico
we
got
to
get
her
a
real
name
it's
so
cool
that
she's
ours
willow
pauses
uh
yours
that
she's
yours
isis
cool
she
can
be
ours
if
you
want
willow
just
smiles
at
that
you
still
need
an
elective
tara
glances
down
at
booklet
how
about
sophomore
level
psychology
oh
kinda
psyched
out
since
professor
walsh
maybe
something
fun
like
drama
i
could
be
dramatic
willow
picks
the
kitten
up
again
in
front
of
her
face
willow
dramatic
voice
you
cannot
have
more
catnip
you
have
a
catnip
problem
tara
laughing
definitely
drama
the
kitty
starts
pawing
at
willow's
hair
and
face
she
lowers
it
to
her
lap
again
i
haven't
even
dealt
with
the
housing
situation
yet
have
you
done
anything
i
hear
there
some
offcampus
places
that
are
way
cool
for
groups
to
you
know
go
in
on
oh
i
just
figured
you'd
be
dorming
it
up
with
buffy
again
well
we
haven't
really
talked
about
it
i
used
to
assume
we'd
be
roomies
through
grad
school
well
into
little
old
lady
hood
you
know
cheating
at
bingo
together
and
forgetting
to
take
our
pills
but
but
i
don't
know
it
hardly
feels
like
we're
roomies
now
i
mean
she's
busy
with
riley
and
i'm
gone
a
lot
too
willow
considers
this
and
doesn't
look
happy
about
it
i
guess
i
should
ask
her
cut
to
exterior
of
stevenson
hall
the
next
day
cut
to
close
up
of
the
chocolate
poster
on
buffy's
door
there
is
a
knock
on
the
other
side
buffy
opens
it
to
reveal
riley
i
got
a
little
tired
of
sitting
around
waiting
so
buffy
is
looking
at
the
pants
he
has
on
and
grins
slightly
you
joined
the
circus
xander
took
my
clothes
to
clean
'em
and
left
me
these
riley
stepping
inside
does
he
uh
hate
me
in
some
way
i
don't
know
about
yet
i
think
i
would've
attracted
less
attention
in
my
uniform
buffy
uncertain
is
it
okay
for
you
to
be
here
you
tell
me
i
just
meant
with
the
government
branch
hunting
you
down
and
all
i'm
good
he
reaches
into
his
back
pocket
and
pulls
out
a
small
cell
phone
which
looks
as
if
it's
been
juryrigged
and
uh
it
took
me
a
while
but
i
patched
into
their
frequency
riley
clicks
it
on
and
we
hear
a
garbled
voice
can't
sneak
up
on
a
guy
if
he's
listening
in
you're

spike
mock

cut
to
the
woods
buffy

patrolling
walking
on
a
dirt
path
leading
up
to
a
cave
entrance
she
is
carrying
the
blaster
professor
walsh
had
given
her
spike
the
i
in
team
she's
heading
towards
the
cave
when
forrest
gates
jumps
out
into
the
path
behind
her
and
she
whirls
around
to
face
him
they
are
pointing
their
blasters
at
each
other
don't
shoot
give
me
a
reason
not
to
you're
killing
humans
now
not
yet
buffy
lowers
blaster
beating
you
senseless
should
do
just
fine
i
can
have
a
patrol
here
in
under
a
minute
so
here's
the
plan
you
go
you're
way
i'll
go
mine
buffy
turns
and
continues
to
the
cave
forrest
starts
to
follow
but
stops
when
she
looks
back
at
him
i'm
checking
out
that
cave
my
orders
exactly
alone
we're
spread
a
little
thin
so
yeah
family's
tearing
apart
buffy
sarcastic
family
what
kind
of
family
are
you
corleones
she
turns
and
enters
the
cave
cut
to
interior
buffy
steps
inside
followed
by
forrest
we
weren't
until
you
showed
up
what
no
girls
in
the
club
you
think
you're
the
first
girlfriend
riley's
ever
had
buffy
stops
to
glare
at
his
back
as
he
continues
ahead
such
a
big
head
on
that
skinny
little
body
forrest
stops
to
face
her
no
you're
just
the
first
one
to
get
him
to
commit
treason
riley
had
a
career
and
a
future
till
he
met
you
and
yeah
i
got
a
problem
with
that
a
future
a
future
doing
what
buffy
steps
closer
to
him
illegal
experiments
torture
murder
i
guess
killing
someone
isn't
really
a
problem
for
you
less
and
less
and
why
don't
you
get
the
hell
out
of
here
before
i
he
takes
a
threatening
step
to
her
buffy
angry
touch
me
and
you'll
find
out
what
slayer
strength
is
like
forrest
gamely
i
think
it's
about
time
you
showed
me
then
adam
os
yes
they
look
back
the
way
they
came
and
see
adam
suddenly
standing
there
i
think
that
would
be
interesting
off
buffy
and
forrest's
oh
shit
expressions
fade
out
part
two

fade
in
buffy
steps
forward
ready
to
fire
her
blaster
but
adam
swings
his
arm
and
knocks
it
out
of
her
hands
she
quickly
strikes
with
a
front
kick
that
does
little
damage
and
blocks
adam's
arm
when
he
swings
it
at
her
again
forrest
rushes
in
to
attack
but
buffy
is
between
him
and
adam
and
shoves
him
back
hard
get
out
of
here
as
forrest
falls
to
the
ground
buffy
hits
adam
in
the
face
with
a
hard
backhand
adam
hardly
feels
it
and
grabs
her
by
the
neck
throwing
her
across
the
cave
she
slams
into
the
rock
wall
and
drops
to
the
ground
adam
turns
his
attention
to
forrest
and
his
polgara
skewer
juts
out
of
his
left
arm
forrest
is
getting
back
to
his
feet
not
moving
he
raises
his
blaster
and
fires
it
at
adam
reacting
to
the
blast
adam
arches
back
his
arms
wide
as
if
accepting
the
charge
the
rings
of
electricity
course
over
his
body
then
seem
to
be
absorbed
within
him
he
looks
at
forrest
thank
you
buffy
saw
this
and
is
rising
to
her
knees
go
get
out
but
forrest
charges
adam
and
the
demonoid
cyborg
meets
him
with
the
skewer
shoving
it
through
his
chest
no
forrest
quickly
goes
limp
and
buffy
runs
towards
them
with
his
free
arm
adam
tosses
forrest's
body
in
the
air
and
it
slides
off
his
skewer
and
crashes
into
buffy
knocking
her
down
adam
immediately
picks
up
forrest's
blaster
oh
god
buffy
rolls
forrest's
body
off
of
herself
and
is
rising
to
her
feet
when
adam
fires
the
blaster
the
charge
hits
her
full
force
and
sends
her
flying
back
where
she
collides
with
a
large
boulder
she
drops
to
her
knees
and
as
soon
as
she's
on
her
feet
bolts
for
the
entrance
adam
tracks
her
with
the
gun
and
fires
another
blast
it
just
barely
misses
her
blowing
apart
a
huge
chunk
of
the
cave
wall
cut
to
outside
we
see
buffy
stumbling
out
of
the
cave
on
legs
that
don't
seem
to
work
right
but
she
continues
to
pick
up
speed
as
she
runs
down
the
hill
she
takes
a
quick
glance
over
her
shoulder
it
doesn't
look
like
adam
is
after
her
but
she
doesn't
stop
desperate
to
escape
she
suddenly
loses
her
footing
on
the
edge
of
a
steeper
slope
and
tumbles
down
the
incline
she
doesn't
roll
very
far
before
she's
stopped
by
a
large
rock
sticking
out
of
the
ground
hitting
her
head
hard
cut
to
overhead
shot
looking
down
on
her
buffy
is
lying
unconscious
beside
the
rock
her
head
turned
to
the
side
we
can
see
a
gash
on
the
left
side
of
her
forehead
and
a
bruise
already
forming
next
to
her
eye
cut
to
elevated
shot
of
sunnydale
nighttime
cut
to
spike
walking
casually
down
the
steps
to
the
courtyard
of
giles'
apartment
building
he
is
wearing
the
commando
garb
xander
provided
him
with
he
stops
before
reaching
giles'
front
door
taking
one
last
pull
on
his
cigarette
then
grounds
it
out
under
his
boot
he
stands
there
for
a
moment
then
takes
a
couple
of
deep
breaths
prepping
himself
and
rushes
into
the
apartment
spike
closing
the
door
i
think
i
lost
the
buggers
willow
stands
up
from
where
she
was
sitting
at
giles'
desk
any
luck
with
the
disks
he
pulls
out
a
few
disks
from
the
pockets
of
his
flak
jacket
and
commando
pants
spike
handing
them
to
her
took
what
they
had
should
be
something
useful
on
one
of
them
hope
so
willow
sits
down
again
in
front
of
her
laptop
tara
is
standing
beside
her
what
are
we
looking
for
willow
sliding
one
of
the
disks
into
her
laptop
anything
about
adam
giles
is
sitting
at
the
bar
pouring
himself
a
drink
he
doesn't
sound
completely
sober
giles
unconcerned
were
there
any
problems
getting
in
and
out
no
i
mean
a
couple
of
them
made
me
on
the
way
out
but
i
took
care
of
'em
giles
sarcastic
gave
them
a
good
runningawayfromthem
did
you
spike
shoots
him
a
look
well
yeah
when
do
i
get
paid
when
willow
tells
me
you've
brought
us
something
useful
spike
turns
his
attention
to
willow
tara
is
looking
at
what
she's
doing
with
interest
and
he
notices
the
subtle
but
intimate
way
she's
stroking
a
lock
of
willow's
hair
he
raises
a
thoughtful
eyebrow
taking
note
of
this
then
he
steps
up
behind
giles
i
could've
gone
straight
to
the
slayer
you
know
i
cut
you
in
let
you
pretend
you're
actually
in
charge
now
you've
got
to
wait
for
red's
permission
to
finish
the
deal
giles
is
seething
into
his
drink
as
soon
as
we
see
what's
on
the
disks
the
laptop
starts
making
electronic
jittery
noises
it
looks
like
gibberish
giles
and
spike
look
over
at
them
gibberish
they're
encrypted
oh
wonderful
giles
steps
away
from
the
bar
and
disappears
down
the
hall
on
the
laptop
there
are
small
symbols
crisscrossing
the
screen
can
you
fix
'em
crack
a
government
encryption
code
on
my
laptop
easy
as
really
difficult
pie
why
spike
sighs
you're
not
exactly
the
whiz
these
days
either
god
i'm
never
gonna
get
paid
effected
by
the
offhanded
remark
willow
shifts
uncomfortably
in
her
chair
i
am
a
whiz
she
is
a
whiz
if
every
a
whiz
there
was
ii
just
need

just
heard

weren't
willow
hits
a
key
and
the
jittering
stops
your
mates
said

weren't
playing
with
computers
so
much
spike
indicates
tara
into
the
new
thing

a
phase

get
over
it
what

it
buffy
willow
to
tara
'cause

an
alley
and
we
see
a
commando
go
flying
across
the
alley
and
hit
the
wall
riley
comes
running
around
the
corner
just
in
time
to
see
him
fall
to
the
pavement
unconscious
he
hears
fighting
further
down
the
alley
and
raises
his
flashlight
shining
it
on
the
back
of
a
figure
in
a
long
black
coat
as
soon
as
the
light
hits
him
the
person
whirls
around
and
glares
at
riley
off
angel's
pissed
off
expression
fade
out
part
three

fade
in
angel
and
riley
are
facing
each
other
angel
is
standing
amidst
the
bodies
of
three
more
unconscious
commandos
riley
lowers
the
flashlight
riley
finn
riley
slips
the
flashlight
into
his
cargo
pocket
i
know
you
we
have
a
friend
in
common
recognition
fills
riley's
expression
angel
angel
takes
a
step
forward
glancing
down
at
the
commandos
on
the
ground
welcoming
committee
your
idea
way
i
heard
it
you
were
all
peaceable
now
you
didn't
by
any
chance
go
and
lose
that
pesky
soul
again
did
you
angel
dangerously
don't
push
me
boy
if
riley
had
tail
feathers
they
would
have
been
ruffled
if
he
had
whiskers
they
would
have
bristled
riley
calm
rage
now
what
possibly
could've
happened
with
buffy
that
would
make
you
lose
your
soul
angel
is
walking
a
slow
path
that
would
take
him
around
riley
angel
coolly
that'd
be
between
me
and
her
riley
steps
in
angel's
path
and
hits
the
release
on
the
asp
in
his
hand
extending
it
to
a
baton
where
do
you
think
you're
going
going
to
see
an
old
girlfriend
they
are
now
standing
right
in
front
of
each
other
oh
you
really
think
i'm
gonna
let
that
happen
you
think
you're
gonna
stop
me
i
surely
do
angel
throws
a
right
cross
at
riley's
face
but
he
deflects
it
with
his
free
hand
and
whips
the
baton
into
angel's
face
riley
quickly
spins
into
a
backhand
swing
and
angel
catches
his
arm
forcing
him
down
on
one
knee
and
slams
a
knee
into
riley's
face
angel
doesn't
let
him
go
and
lifts
him
back
to
his
feet
to
swing
him
around
and
throw
him
through
the
air
riley
flies
back
into
a
large
heap
of
trash
bags
and
card
board
boxes
next
to
the
loading
dock
of
a
building
he
scrambles
out
of
the
trash
onto
the
loading
dock
and
picks
up
his
baton
where
it
had
landed
angel
leaps
high
through
the
air
landing
on
the
dock
before
riley
can
get
to
his
feet
riley
uses
the
baton
to
block
angel's
kick
but
the
weapon
is
knocked
out
of
his
hand
and
the
vampire
punches
him
across
the
face
still
on
his
knees
riley
retaliates
with
a
fist
to
angel's
groin
and
as
the
vampire
bends
down
around
his
pain
gets
to
his
feet
picking
up
an
empty
liquor
bottle
and
smashes
it
over
his
head
he
grabs
angel
by
the
coat
and
rams
a
knee
into
his
back
sending
him
against
the
building
angel
swings
a
backhand
but
riley
blocks
it
and
slams
the
same
knee
into
his
stomach
angel
recovers
and
grabs
riley's
flak
jacket
slamming
him
back
against
a
heavy
door
he
hits
angel
in
the
face
with
a
left
cross
but
angel
just
slams
him
against
the
door
again
getting
his
hands
around
his
throat
as
riley
is
forced
down
under
angel's
strength
he
pulls
out
a
taser
from
his
jacket
and
shoves
into
angel's
chest
the
shock
flings
him
back
and
he
falls
into
the
trash
heap
riley's
on
his
feet
and
goes
after
him
angel
raises
his
head
and
growls
at
him
in
full
vamp
face
riley
plants
a
hard
kick
into
his
chest
and
angel
tumbles
out
onto
the
pavement
standing
over
him
riley
tries
to
hit
him
with
the
taser
once
more
but
angel
catches
his
wrist
forcing
him
to
drop
it
and
drives
a
fist
into
his
stomach
he
lifts
riley
over
his
head
and
growls
as
he
runs
with
him
across
the
alley
to
send
him
crashing
into
a
group
of
storage
drums
against
the
side
of
a
warehouse
riley
tumbles
to
the
ground
but
angel
picks
him
up
again
and
sends
him
flying
to
the
other
side
of
the
alley
he
lands
on
a
pile
of
large
metal
conduit
tubes
which
break
his
fall
none
to
gently
and
he
flops
to
the
pavement
angel
hears
the
loud
engine
of
an
approaching
vehicle
and
quickly
climbs
up
the
side
of
the
warehouse
disappearing
over
the
top
riley
is
on
his
knees
when
he
sees
the
humvee
rounding
the
corner
he
manages
to
get
to
his
feet
and
hurries
on
unsteady
legs
down
a
narrow
passage
between
two
of
the
buildings
before
the
headlights
sweep
the
alley
cut
to
buffy's
dorm
room
she
walks
inside
looking
like
hell
and
removes
her
jacket
as
she
steps
up
to
the
mirror
on
the
wall
ugly
bruising
has
formed
around
the
gash
on
her
forehead
and
she
winces
as
she
touches
it
with
her
fingers
cut
to
outside
her
door
someone
steps
in
front
of
it
and
knocks
a
moment
later
buffy
opens
the
door
and
is
surprised
to
see
angel
hi
can
i
come
in
buffy
softly
i
guess
he
hesitates
uh
i
need
a
little
more
than
that
oh
um
come
in
he
walks
inside
past
her
and
she
closes
the
door
he
turns
to
face
her
and
she
takes
notice
of
the
blood
on
his
temple
and
his
split
bottom
lip
buffy
stoic
you're
hurt
you
too
i'll
live
you
want
to
tell
me
who
ran
your
face
into
that
doorknob
not
really
it's
not
worldinperil
stuff
let
me
guess
buffy
a
touch
of
venom
you
thought
of
something
else
really
hurtful
to
say
and
well
you
couldn't
tell
me
on
the
phone
because
the
funniest
part
is
that
look
on
my
face
buffy
please
i
really
don't
have
a
lot
of
time
she
hears
the
slight
urgency
in
his
voice
buffy
concerned
what's
going
on
the
door
bursts
open
a
riley
steps
in
steadying
himself
against
the
shelf
of
willow's
desk
he
raises
his
arm
and
aims
the
baretta
in
his
hand
at
angel
thumbing
back
the
hammer
riley
pissed
i
told
you
you
weren't
coming
near
her
buffy
takes
in
his
battered
appearance
she
goes
ballistic
buffy
pissed
you've
got
to
be
kidding
me
this
is
why
you
came
no
this
was
accident
buffy
very
pissed
running
a
car
into
a
tree
is
an
accident
running
your
fist
into
somebody's
face
is
a
plan
please
explain
this
to
me
angel
doesn't
answer
her
but
looks
at
riley
angel
calmly
put
that
gun
down
it's
pretty
much
all
i
got
left
so
i'm
thinking
not
he
attacked
four
of
my
men
buffy
i
think
he's
up
to
his
old
tricks
he
won't
hurt
anybody
buffy
to
angel
tell
him
angel
starts
to
move
forward
angel
with
contained
violence
might
hurt
you
riley
steps
forward
please
try
heh
some
threat
you
can
barely
stand
riley
brandishes
the
gun
in
front
of
his
face
trigger
finger
feels
okay
angel
sideglance
to
buffy
you
actually
sleep
with
this
guy
while
his
head's
turned
riley
punches
him
in
the
face
angel
quickly
hits
him
back
okay
stop
it
buffy
steps
in
between
them
and
shoves
them
apart
riley
slams
back
against
willow's
desk
and
angel
goes
flying
onto
willow's
bed
okay
that's
enough
i
see
one
more
display
of
testosterone
poisoning
and
i
will
personally
put
you
both
in
the
hospital
she
glances
back
and
forth
between
them
riley
looks
like
he
still
wants
to
shoot
angel
buffy
challengingly
anybody
think
i'm
exaggerating
he
started
buffy
points
a
warning
finger
at
him
and
he
wisely
shuts
up
she
gives
him
a
working
my
last
nerve
look
and
walks
over
to
riley
buffy
softly
riley
buffy
glances
at
his
gun
i'm
sorry
riley
holsters
it
just
wanted
to
know
that
you
were
safe
buffy
gently
i
need
to
talk
to
angel
for
a
minute
riley
exasperated
what
riley
please
he
looks
over
at
angel
who's
just
sitting
down
on
the
bed
elbows
resting
on
his
knees
he
looks
down
at
buffy
again
riley
quietly
firm
i'm
not
leaving
this
room
riley
crosses
his
arms
i
mean
it
riley
continues
to
glare
at
angel
buffy
looks
over
her
shoulder
and
gives
angel
a
slight
tilt
of
her
head
then
walks
past
riley
to
the
door
angel
stands
up
to
follow
her
and
doesn't
even
bother
to
hide
the
smirk
on
his
face
as
he
passes
riley
he
closes
the
door
and
riley
is
left
alone
not
moving
a
muscle
out
in
the
empty
hall
buffy
turns
on
angel
buffy
angry
okay
i
come
to
see
you
to
help
you
and
you
treat
me
like
i'm
just
your
ex
well
technically
shut
up
and
then
you
order
me
out
of
your
city
and
then
you
come
here
and
start
pounding
on
my
boyfriend
i
would
really
like
to
know
what
the
hell
are
you
trying
to
do
i
was
trying
to
make
things
better
she
regards
his
sincere
expression
and
can't
keep
herself
from
laughing
it
becomes
contagious
because
angel
can't
help
but
to
smile
also
heh
well
angel
chuckles
it's
a
going
pretty
good
don't
you
think
buffy
is
leaning
against
the
wall
buffy
smiling
swell
you
know
heh
angel
seriously
i
couldn't
leave
it
like
that
the
way
i
spoke
to
you
i
came
to
apologize
i
i
had
no
right
and
riley
i
got
jumped
by
some
soldiers
he
came
in
in
the
middle
and
wasn't
real
forthcoming
with
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
put
yourself
in
his
place
angel
does
consider
this
i
get
it
buffy
is
looking
down
at
the
floor
look
you
weren't
entirely
wrong
what
you
said
in
la
buffy
meets
his
eyes
we
don't
live
in
each
other's
worlds
anymore
i
had
no
right
to
barge
in
on
yours
and
make
judgments
i'm
still
sorry
thank
you
and
next
time
i'll
apologize
by
phone
buffy
laughs
softly
uh
things
are
pretty
tense
around
here
buffy
rests
her
head
back
tiredly
they
really
are
can
i
do
anything
honestly
i
think
the
best
thing
you
can
do
right
now
is
angel
understandingly
okay
it
means
a
lot
that
you
came
angel
just
looks
at
her
for
a
moment
then
starts
walking
down
the
hall
buffy
his
heading
to
her
door
when
angel
turns
around
again
oh
and
riley
yeah
i
don't
like
him
buffy
smiles
thank
you
angel
turns
and
continues
down
the
hall
buffy
watches
him
for
a
couple
of
seconds
then
returns
to
her
room
she
opens
the
door
and
we
see
that
riley
did
in
fact
move
several
muscles
for
he
is
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
he
has
removed
his
flak
jacket
and
turns
to
face
her
cut
to
adam's
lair
he
is
sitting
in
front
of
his
computer
setup
the
metal
plate
on
the
left
side
of
his
head
is
open
and
there
is
a
cable
plugged
into
a
socket
wiring
him
directly
to
the
system
we
hear
a
heavy
door
being
opened
and
he
looks
over
to
see
spike
walking
into
the
chamber
the
vampire
is
back
in
his
usual
attire
and
is
finishing
off
a
can
of
beer
spike
happily
now
that
spike
crushes
can
and
throws
it
down
was
fun
you
were
successful
spike
scoffs
easier
than
i'd
thought
it'd
be
too
you're
sure
spike
scoffs
feel
it
in
my
bones
it's
uh
called
the
yoko
factor
spike
lights
a
cigarette
and
adam
just
looks
at
him
don't
tell
me
you've
never
heard
of
the
beatles
adam
disconnects
the
cable
and
closes
his
face
plate
i
have
adam
stands
i
like
helter
skelter
adam
crosses
to
the
other
side
of
the
chamber
what
a
surprise
the
point
is
they
were
once
a
real
powerful
group
it's
not
a
stretch
to
say
they
ruled
the
world
and
when
they
broke
up
everyone
blamed
yoko
but
the
fact
is
the
group
split
itself
apart
she
just
happened
to
be
there
and
you
know
how
it
is
with
kids
they
go
off
to
college
they
grow
apart
way
of
the
world
so
you
separated
the
slayer
from
her
friends
i'm
pleased
adam
turns
and
gazes
down
at
the
ground
looking
thoughtful
well
since
we've
got
all
our
ducks
in
a
row
and
not
talking
to
each
other
guess
it's
time
for
the
grand
plan
huh
you
know
the
one
where
i
get
the
chipectomy
you
got
everything
you
need
right
adam
looks
at
him
no
there's
one
more
thing
spike
regards
him
with
a
frown
part
four

fade
in
from
where
we
left
buffy
and
riley
she's
stepping
up
to
him
and
they're
standing
between
the
beds
buffy
softly
how

i
thought
we
had
i
don't
know
much
about
angel
buffy
lowers
her
eyes
or
your
relationship
with
him
but
all
i
ask
is
if
you're
gonna
break
heart

it
fast
buffy
looks
up
at
him
frowning
what
you
think
that
angel
and
i
didn't
you
no
of
course
not
how
can
you
even
ask
me

riley
sighs

the
deadest
man
in
deadonia

fault

prodded
and
he
explained
how
angel
went
bad

uh
trigger
buffy
quietly
oh
and
uh
riley
chuckles
after
that
i
went
a
little
nuts
you
know
i
mean
on
the
one
hand
i
should
believe
in
us
but
on
the
other
sometimes
things
happen
between

i
saw
that
he
was
bad

not
bad
riley
just
looks
at
her

a
good
day
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
in
confirmation

takes
riley's
hand
and

on
her
bed

reason
to
feel
that

can't
trust

riley
looks
into
buffy's
eyes
riley
meaningfully
because
i'm
so
in
love
with

i
can't
think
straight
her
eyes
start
to
glisten

me
about
it
he
hugs
her
and
she
closes
her
eyes
as
she
holds
him
tight
riley
buffy
pulls
away
i
still
have
to
tell
you
something
and
there's
no
easy
way

say
it
buffy
takes
a
beat

riley
takes
this
news
and
leans
his
elbows
on
his
knees
resting
his
face
in
his
hands
buffy
gently
i'm
so
sorry

was
a
fight

his
head
and

now
riley
walks
to
the
door
grabbing
his
flak
jacket
off
willow's
chair
and
leaves
buffy's
looks
concerned

long
before

not
be
accused
of
crazy
talk
giles
is
in
the
kitchen
pouring
himself
a
drink
and
more
inebriated
than
ever
what
ever
happened
to
latin

least
when
that
made
no
sense
the
church
approved
buffy
slightly
impatient
i
can't
just
wait
around

the
disk
is
no
good
to
me
unless
you
crack
it
soon
buffy
doesn't
see
willow's
withering
look
behind
her
back
as
she
walks
towards
the
living
room
area
anya
is
sitting
on
the
arm
of
the
couch
her
feet
on
the
cushion
xander
is
sitting
next
to

not
looking
entirely
happy

xander
delivered
clothing

the
cork
of
the
liquor
bottle
with
his
palm
sorry

reason

out
track
him
if
i
have
to
willow

he
can
rip
your
arms
off
for
you
willow
sternly
buffy

shocked

steps
out
of
the
kitchen
drink
in
hand
and
leans
against
the
entrance
of
the
hallway
sorry

a
bit
honest
giles
drunken
grin
terribly
sorry
xander
standing
so
she
doesn't
go
alone
xander
turns
to
him
giles
weapons
all
around

xander
xander
turns
to
face
her
giving
her
a
hard
look
yyou'd
get
hurt
xander
as
if
expecting
this
oh

she's
standing
at
one
end
of
the
coffee
table
across
from
buffy
xander
is
between
them
tara
slips
past
giles
and
disappears
down
the
hallway
willow
still
sarcastic
oh

have
your
new
no
arms
we

all
say

the
way
of

anya

up
from

to
ship
me
off
to
the
army
to

out
of
the
way
the
army
you
didn't
think
i
knew
about

you
you
two
talking
about
me
behind
my
back
willow
frowns
at
him
us
talking
about
you
how
about
you
telling
riley
every
last
detail
of
my
life
with
angel
and
besides
when
is
there
any
us
two
you
two
are
the
two
who
are
the
two

the
other
one
uhhuh
but

that
all
changes
when
i'm
doing
situps
over
at
fort
dix
giles
almost
chokes
on
his
drink
fort
dix
giles
bursts
out
in
a
wheezing
laugh
the
three
of
them
stare
at
him
are
you
drunk
giles
happily
yes
quite
a
bit
actually
well
stop
it
buffy
to
xander
and
willow
this
is
stupid
stupid
so
you
finally
have
the
guts
to
say
it
to
my
face
i
didn't
say
you
were
stupid
so
stop
being
an
idiot
and
let
me
fix
this
xander
rolls
his
head
in
an
exasperated
way
and
sits
down
on
the
couch
okay
i
need
you
i
need
both
of
you
all
the
time
just
not
now
adam
is
very
dangerous
wait
how
do
you
need
me
really
you're
good
with
the
computer
stuff
willow
accepts
that
usually
willow
glares
at
her
andand
there's
the
witch
stuff
willow
accusingly
witch
stuff
what
exactly
do
you
mean
by
witch
stuff
you
guys
what
is
happening
this
is
crazy
oh
no
it's
not
giles
moves
to
his
desk
it's
all
finally
making
perfect
sense
and
i'm
not
going
to
miss
a
moment
of
it
he
sets
his
drink
down
and
tries
to
sit
but
his
aim
is
off
and
his
ass
doesn't
come
close
to
hitting
the
chair
and
he
drops
to
the
floor
cut
to
giles'
very
clean
white
bathroom
anya
is
sitting
on
the
closed
lid
of
the
toilet
and
tara
is
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
tub
they
can
still
hear
the
muffled
argument
on
the
other
side
of
the
closed
door
you
think
this
will
go
on
for
a
while
anya
nonchalant
hard
to
say
they
fall
silent
as
they
look
around
the
bathroom
nice
bathroom
anya
nodding
like
the
tile
cut
back
to
the
others
xander
is
on
his
feet
again
rounding
to
stand
behind
the
couch
behind
him
giles
stumbles
towards
the
stairs
taking
off
his
glasses
and
if
i
did
join
the
army
i'd
be
great
you
know
why
'cause
they
might
give
me
a
job
that
couldn't
be
done
by
any
welltrained
border
collie
that's
it
i'm
going
to
bed
giles
struggles
to
pull
his
sweater
over
his
head
as
he
stomps
up
the
stairs
willow
stands
beside
xander
no
you'd
do
wonderful
in
the
army
hey
do
you
think
the
umbilical
cord
between
you
and
anya
can
stretch
that
far
i
knew
it
i
knew
you
hated
her
giles'
sweater
drops
down
from
the
loft
above
and
falls
on
him
covering
his
face
xander
yanks
it
off
his
head
look
i'm
not
the
one
being
judgmental
here
i'll
leave
that
territory
to
you
and
buffy
judgmental
if
i
was
anymore
openminded
about
the
choices
you
two
make
my
whole
brain
would
fall
out
xander
to
willow
oh
and
superior
don't
forget
that
xander
to
buffy
just
because
you're
better
than
us
doesn't
mean
that
you
can
be
all
superior
he
walks
past
her
and
crosses
his
arms
as
he
leans
against
a
cabinet
dresser
behind
her
you
guys
stop
this
what
happened
to
you
today
it's
not
today
buffy
things
have
been
wrong
for
a
while
don't
you
see
that
what
do
you
mean
wrong
well
they
certainly
haven't
been
right
since
tara
we
have
to
face
it
you
can't
handle
tara
being
my
girlfriend
no
it
was
bad
before
that
xander
steps
out
in
between
them
again
since
you
two
went
off
to
college
and
forgot
about
me
just
left
me
in
the
basement
to
xander
turns
on
willow
in
shock
tara's
your
girlfriend
giles
from
upstairs
bloody
hellll
enough
all
i
know
is
you
want
to
help
right
be
part
of
the
team
willow
and
xander
shake
their
heads
grumbling
i
don't
know
anymore
xander
in
unison
really
not
wanted
buffy
raising
her
voice
no
no
you
said
you
wanted
to
go
so
let's
go
all
of
us
we'll
walk
into
that
cave
with
you
two
attacking
me
and
the
funny
drunk
drooling
on
my
shoe
hey
hey
maybe
that's
the
secret
way
of
killing
adam
buffy
buffy
hurt
and
angry
is
that
it
is
that
how
you
can
help
buffy
takes
a
beat
you're
not
answering
me
how
can
you
possibly
help
they
don't
reply
and
turn
their
eyes
away
from
her
she
regards
them
silently
for
a
moment
buffy
somberly
so
i
guess
i'm
starting
to
understand
why
there's
no
ancient
prophecy
about
a
chosen
one
and
her
friends
buffy
hurries
to
the
door
grabbing
her
jacket
if
i
need
help
i'll
go
to
someone
i
can
count
on
they
don't
move
as
she
slams
the
door
leaving
them
behind
cut
to
adam's
lair
we
hear
the
heavy
door
opening
again
adam
is
standing
and
turns
when
someone
walks
into
the
chamber
i've
been
waiting
for
you
cut
to
close
up
of
riley
and
now
i'm
here
to
be
continued
