in
and
aims
his
gun
at
her
freeze
officer1
buffy
faces
him
put
your
hands
up
back
away
from
the
girl
slowly
another
officer
comes
in
behind
the
first
gun
drawn
and
surveying
the
scene
buffy
slowly
gets
to
her
feet
and
raises
her
hands
look
i
didn't
do
anything
do
it
now
the
second
officer
holsters
her
gun
and
crouches
down
to
feel
for
kendra's
pulse
but
can't
find
one
this
one's
dead
what
about
up
there
officer1
nods
toward
the
mezzanine
buffy
and
officer2
look
up
at
the
stacks
and
see
xander
lying
unconscious
on
the
floor
behind
the
railing

she
starts
to
go
to
him
but
officer2
grabs
her
and
pushes
her
back

her
out
of
here

if

the
second
officer
hands

off
to

and
then
goes
to
check
on
xander
buffy
offers
no
resistance
and
lets
herself
be
led
out
officer2
crouches
down
by
xander
to
check
him
out
cut
to
the
hall
outside
the
library
officer1
leads
buffy
out
please
you
don't

you'd
do
well
to
keep
your
mouth
shut
missy
they
turn
down
the
hall
and
see
snyder
coming
down
followed
by
two
more
officers
but
i
didn't
do
anything
why
do
i
find
that
so
very
hard
to
believe
officer1
to
the
other
officers
in
there
officer1
to
snyder
you
know
this
girl
buffy
summers
if
there's
trouble
she's
behind
it
buffy
angrily
you
stupid
little
troll
you
have
no
idea
attitude
problem
serious
buffy
faces
the
officer
look
i
just
wanna
know
if
my
friends
are
okay
all
right
that's
enough
he
spins
her
back
around
and
gets
out
his
handcuffs
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent
anything
you
say
can
and
buffy
glances
over
her
shoulder
and
without
warning
backhand
punches
the
officer
in
the
face
he
grunts
in
pain
and
stumbles
backward
into
the
lockers
she
grabs
him
by
the
neck
and
pushes
his
head
down
flipping
him
over
onto
his
back
snyder
takes
a
shocked
step
back
he
is
too
stunned
by
what
he
just
saw
her
do
to
move
and
just
lets
her
run
down
the
hall
without
even
looking
officer2
comes
out
of
the
library
and
sees
her
partner
on
the
floor
and
buffy
running
away
she
raises
her
gun
and
takes
aim
at
buffy
stop
now
snyder
turns
around
to
see
buffy
running
away
but
he's
still
too
shook
up
to
have
the
sense
to
get
out
of
the
officer's
way
get
down
buffy
looks
back
and
turns
down
an
adjacent
hall
and
the
officer
takes
a
shot
the
bullet
shatters
the
window
of
the
hall
door
the
other
two
officers
come
out
of
the
library
guns
drawn
and
ready
and
she
waves
them
in
buffy's
direction
they
run
in
pursuit
she
grabs
the
radio
mic
at
her
shoulder
and
puts
out
a
bulletin
on
buffy

the
hall
outside
the
emergency
room
at
sunnydale
general
hospital
buffy
comes
into
the
hall
wearing
a
wool
cap
and
a
long
dark
coat
she
averts
her
eyes
from
the
doctors
and
nurses
on
the
wall
she
finds
a
slot
with
a
few
patient
histories
and
checks
the
names
on
them
there
are
none
she's
interested
in
she
continues
slowly
down
the
hall
avoiding
the
eyes
of
a
passing
doctor
she
checks
another
series
of
slots
for
names
on
paperwork
but
finds
nothing
further
down
the
hall
she
turns
down
the
left
passageway
behinds
her
xander
walks
up
and
touches
her
on
the
back
she
gasps
and
spins
around
but
is
very
relieved
to
see
him
standing
there
xander
buffy
hugs
him
tightly
ohhh
he
hugs
her
back
and
they
hold
each
other
for
a
long
moment
then
buffy
lets
go
i
was
so
worried
i
didn't
know
if
you
were
okay
the
cops
were
yeah
i
i
heard
them
chase
you
out
i
was
just
coming
out
of
it
xander
holds
up
his
arm
in
a
cast
souvenir
well
what
about
the
others
xander
sees
two
police
officers
come
into
the
hall
behind
her
are
they
okay
he
grabs
her
in
another
tight
hug
buffy
goes
along
with
it
but
wonders
what's
up
when
she
glimpses
the
cops
she
hides
her
face
in
xander's
shoulder
while
they
head
down
the
hall
in
the
direction
that
she
came
in
when
the
police
have
gone
they
separate
again
okay
that
was
about
equal
parts
protecting
me
and
copping
a
feel
right
buffy
smiles
xander
doesn't
smile
back
he
turns
his
face
down
looking
sad
and
very
worried
what
is
it
cut
to
willow
lying
unconscious
in
a
hospital
bed
she
has
a
bandaged
cut
on
her
forehead
and
a
black
eye
but
otherwise
seems
unhurt
the
camera
pans
up
from
her
face
to
buffy
and
xander
standing
next
to
the
bed
the
doctor
said
it
was
head
trauma
she
can
wake
up
at
any
time
but
um
the
longer
it
lasts
the
less
likely
it
is
i
never
should've
let
her
try
to
do
that
curse
angel
must've
known
she
reaches
up
to
willow's
face
and
brushes
back
a
few
stray
hairs
where
are
her
parents
with
relatives
in
phoenix
i
gave
them
a
call
they're
they're
getting
on
a
plane
back
does
oz
know
xander
realizes
his
omission
oh
man
um
i
didn't
even
think
um
i'll
call
him
buffy
hears
some
footsteps
behind
her
and
turns
quickly
to
see
who
it
is
xander
looks
over
his
shoulder
too
and
they
see
cordelia
come
in
he
goes
over
to
her
hey
cordelia
whispers
hey
they
kiss
and
hold
each
other
close
cordelia
sighs
how
is
she
cordelia
they
separate
and
look
at
willow
the
doctor
told
me
that
yeah
we're
uh
still
waiting
you
okay
i
ran
i
think
i
made
it
through
three
counties
before
i
realized
nobody
was
chasing
me
not
too
brave
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
did
giles
keep
up
with
you
i
didn't
see
giles
you
mean
he's
not
in
the
hospital
no
buffy
gives
them
a
very
concerned
stare
cut
to
angelus'
mansion
giles
is
lying
on
the
floor
angelus
lies
on
the
floor
facing
him
and
waiting
for
him
to
regain
consciousness
mm
giles
stirs
a
bit
and
exhales
ohhh
giles
lifts
his
head
hi
rupert
i
wasn't
sure
you

gonna
wake
up
you

me
worried
angelus
hops
to
his
feet
giles
standing
up
slowly
what
do
you
want
i
wanna
torture
you
i
used
to
love

and
it's
been
a
long
time
i

last
time
i
tortured
somebody
they
didn't
even
have
chainsaws
he
strolls
past
giles
over
to
acathla
giles
turns
to
watch
him
and
sees
the
stone
demon
with
the
sword
protruding
from
its
chest
angelus
notices
giles'
stare
oh
yeah
acathla
he's
an
even
harder

performed
the
rituals

the
right
phrases
blood
on
my
hand

doughnut

for
my
troubles
i
figure

the
ritual

pretty
up
on
these
things
you
could
probably
tell
me
what
i'm
doing
wrong
angelus
approaches
giles
but
honestly
i
sorta
hope
you
don't
angelus
stops
in
front
of
him
'cause
i
really
wanna
torture
you
angelus
stares
evilly
cut
to
the
summers
house
a
police

comes
down
the
stairs
to
where

is
questioning

very
worried
and
confused
cut

so
buffy
just
comes
right
in
giles
giles
she
looks
around
but
doesn't
see
him
behind
her
whistler
comes
down
the
stairs
from
the
loft
i
don't
think
he's
here
buffy
pivots
around
to
face
him
who
are
you
whistler
what
are
you
doing
here
whistler
reaches
the
base
of
the
stairs
i'm

why
'cause
iii
need
a
date
to
the
prom
buffy
is
not
in
the
mood
for

right
now
so
she
takes
the
two
steps
over
to
him
grabs
him
by
the
throat
and
shoves
him
up
against
the
wall
i

had
a
really
bad
day

have
information
worth

your
ribcage
and
wear
it
as
a
hat
buffy
lets

hello
to
the
imagery
very
nice
whistler

it
wasn't
supposed
to
go
down
like
this
whistler
moves
away
from
the
wall
nobody
saw
you
coming
i
figured
this
for
angel's
big
day
but
i
thought
he
was
here
to
stop
acathla
not
to
bring
him
forth
then
you
two
made
with
the
smoochies
now
he's

creep
again
now
what

you
gonna
do
wwhat
are
you

to
maybe
i
should
ask

prepared
to
give
up
buffy
exhales
you
don't
have
anything
useful
to
tell
me
do
you
what

just
some
immortal
demon
sent
down
to
even
the
score
between
good
and
evil
whistler
impressed
wow
good
guess
whistler
grins
buffy
steps
up
to
him
well
why
don't
you
try
getting
off
your
immortal
ass
and
fighting
evil
once
in
a
while
'cause
i'm
sick
and
tired
of
doing
it
myself
in
the
end
you're
always
by
yourself
you're
all
you've
got
that's
the
point
buffy
disgusted
spare
me
buffy
starts
to
leave
the
sword
isn't
enough
you
gotta
be
ready
whistler
raises
his
voice
you
gotta
know
how
to
use
it
she
goes
out
the
door
and
slams
it
behind
her
cut
to
the
park
buffy
walks
through
it
with
her
head
down
a
car
drives
by
she
steps
into
the
street
and
watches
as
the
car
goes
when
she
turns
back
she
sees
a
police
car
coming
but
doesn't
run
instead
hoping
that
the
officer
won't
notice
her
he
does
though
and
turns
on
his
lightbar
and
lets
the
siren
give
a
brief
loud
tone
he
pulls
the
car
aside
stops
and
gets
out
buffy
ignores
him
and
keeps
walking
right
past
the
front
of
the
vehicle
the
officer
draws
his
gun
hold
right
there
officer3
slams
his
door
buffy
spins
around
to
face
him
put
your
hands
on
your
head
do
it
she
stares
at
his
gun
frightened
and
begins
to
raise
her
hands
suddenly
the
gun
gets
kicked
out
of
the
officer's
hands
he
gets
kicked
in
the
face
and
in
the
shin
then
grabbed
and
thrown
onto
the
hood
of
his
car
where
he
lies
unconscious
his
attacker
faces
a
surprised

toward
buffy
and
she
immediately
decks
him
twice
in
the
face
he
grabs
her
by
the
shoulders
to
restrain
her
but
she
brings
her
knee
up
into
his
gut
now
you

gives
her
a

and
spike
aside
and

spike
she
pulls
out
a
stake
while
spike
gives
him
a
series
of
punches
to
the
face
spike's
last
blow
sends
the
vampire
spinning
around
and
staggering

thrusts
the

into

chest
and
he
instantly
crumbles
to
ash

of
angel's
boys
yeah

exchanges
a
look
with

and
realizes
that
it's
time
she
steps
up
to
her
mom
and
looks
up
at
her
hoping
against
hope
for
understanding
mom

blinks
her
eyes
raises

crime
scene

snyder
buffy
looks
up
at
him
approaching

you're
a
criminal
so

much
works
out
snyder
stops

the
police
will
figure
it
out
in
case
you
haven't
noticed
the
police
of
sunnydale
are
deeply
stupid
snyder
takes
a
few
steps
closer
it
doesn't
matter
anyway
whatever
they
find
you've
proved
too
much
of
a
liability
for
this
school
snyder
takes
a
breath
these
are
the
moments
you
want
to
savor
you
wish
time
would
stop
so
that
you
could
live
them
over
and
over
again
smiles
smugly
you're
expelled
buffy
reaches
into
the
bag
and
pulls
out
the
sword
blessed
by
the
knight
who
first
slew
acathla
she
holds
it
up
and
turns
it
in
her
hand
snyder
looks
at
it
at
her
and
gulps
buffy
gazes
at
the
polished
blade

never
ever
got
a
single
date
in
high
school
buffy
turns
her
eyes
to
him
did
you
your
point
being
she
starts
out
of
the
library
and
leans
the
blade
into
his
face
as
she
passes
him
he
bends
back
nervously
and
watches
her
go
this
time
she
makes
no
attempt
to
avoid
the
chalk
markings
on
the
floor
snyder
pulls
out
his
cell
phone
and
dials

checks

holds
the

up
to

runs
her

down

cheek
let's

what's
inside
she
runs
her
hand
up
the
back
of
giles'
head
and
over
the
top
she
closes
her
eyes
and
concentrates
on
reading
his
thoughts
it
doesn't
take
long
for
her
to
discover
something
useful
she
gasps
and
removes
her
hand
drusilla
into
giles'
ear
of
course
she
stands
up
and
goes
around
to
his
other
side
and
holds
up
two
fingers
to
hypnotize
him
look
at
me
giles
turns
his
head
weakly
to
look
away
trying
to
resist
she
comes
around
the
rest
of
the
way
in

of
him
waving
her
fingers
mmmmmmmm
finally
giles
can
no
longer
resist
and

waves
her
fingers
around
some
more
and
draws
them
in
toward
her
own
eyes
be
in

his
weakened
state
giles
quickly
falls
under
her
spell
she
looks
into
his
eyes
and
smiles

covers
his
eyes
with
her
hand
and

whistler
walks
into

i
strongly
suggest

bright
light

thrusts
at

with

with
a
thrust
of
his
own
which
she
also
parries

times

arcing
swing
from

thrust
and

and
escapes
to

up
on

jumps
up
and
over

tries
for

attempt
with
her
blade

trade
several
swings

tries
a
wide
swing
again

this
time
cuts
her
superficially
on
the
arm
he
tries
to
take
advantage
of
her
distraction
and
comes
at
her
with
his
sword
held
high
intending
to
swing
from
above
but
she
drops
to
the
floor
and
rolls
out

smash
a
bowl
on
a
table
behind

kicks
his
legs
out
from
under
him
and
scrambles
back
up

still
on

knees
and
swings
three
times
in
rapid
succession
all
of
which
she
parries

knocks
his
sword
into

table
with
her
parry
and
pins
it
there
he
backhand
punches
her
in
the
face
and
she
spins
away

pulls
the
sword
from

it
hard
at
her

blocks
it
with
hers
and
kicks
him
in
the
gut
making
him
double
over

jumps
over
him
into
the
clear
and
raises
her
sword
to
continue

thrusts
and

he
kicks
her
in

and
she
stumbles
back

to
the

and
breathes
heavily

head
snaps
back
down
and
her
eyes
stare
into

cut
to
angelus'
mansion
the
fight
has
moved
out
into
the
atrium
buffy
hits
the
ground
and
scrambles
back
to
her
feet
as
angelus
slowly
advances
she
thrusts
and
he
parries
she
spins
around
and
swings
at
him
and
he
blocks
her
her
sword
bounces
off
of
his
and
falls
with
the
tip
onto
the
low
wall
of
a
planting
bed
angelus
stomps
on
the
blade
before
she
can
raise
it
again
and
knocks
it
from
her
grip
he
spins
around
and
elbows
her
in
the
face
knocking
her
back
into
a
stone
table
which
collapses
and
falls
with
her
cut
to
acathla
deep
thundering
growls
and
noises
come
from
him
as
he
begins
to
wake
cut
to
spike
choking
drusilla
she
begins
to
lose
consciousness
and
slumps
over
in
his
arms
sorry
baby
wish
there
was
another
way
when
she
begins
to
fall
he
catches
her
lifts
her
into
his
arms
and
starts
to
carry
her
out
on
the
way
he
passes
the
doorway
to
the
atrium
and
glances
outside
when
he
sees
them
he
stops
to
take
a
better
look
buffy
is
backing
up
against
the
wall
without
her
sword
while
angelus
slowly
and
deliberately
advances
on
her
holding
his
god
he's
gonna
kill
her
he
watches
for
another
moment
then
shrugs
and
heads
for
the
garage
with
drusilla
cut
to
the
atrium
angelus
plays
with
his
sword
idly
pointing
it
at
buffy
she
looks
up
at
him
frightened
now
that's
everything
huh
no
weapons
no
friends
no
hope
buffy
closes
her
eyes
and
steels
herself
for
whatever's
coming
take
all
that
away
and
what's
left
he
draws
the
sword
back
and
thrusts
it
directly
at
her
face
with
lightningfast
reflexes
she
swings
up
with
both
arms
and
catches
the
blade
between
the
palms
of
her
hands
she
opens
her
eyes
and
meets
his
me
she
shoves
the
blade
away
from
her
and
the
hilt
of
the
sword
hits
angelus
in
the
face
he
staggers
back
and
she
hops
to
her
feet
and
kicks
him
in
the
chest
he
stumbles
back
even
more
and
she
reaches
down
and
picks
up
her
sword
she
swings
it
around
and
thrusts
at
him
but
he
manages
to
parry
they
exchange
several
blows
blocking
each
other
buffy
spins
around
and
swings
her
sword
down
at
him
from
above
he
holds
up
his
own
to
block
but
she
hits
it
hard
and
he
falls
to
one
knee
she
swings
again
and
he
blocks
she
spins
around
with
a
roundhouse
kick
to
his
side
and
he
collapses
to
the
ground
cut
outside
the
garage

through
the
door
with

lying
unconscious
in
the
passenger's
seat
spike
concentrates
on
the
road
and
whips
around
a
corner
when
heading
straight
again
he
looks
over
at
her
he
reaches
around
her
neck
and
pulls
her
over
to
him
and
holds
her
close
as
he
keeps
driving
with
only
one
hand
on
the
wheel
cut
to
the
mansion
buffy
kicks
angelus
and
he
comes
flying
in
through
the
door
hits
the
floor
and
rolls
to
a
stop
before
he
can
get
all
the
way
back
to
his
feet
buffy
leaps
in
and
swings
her
sword
at
him
he
almost
misses
parrying
her
blow
and
he
steps
back
to
get
his
footing
they
exchange
a
few
more
swings
angelus
misses
a
block
and
gets
sliced
on
his
hand
cut
to
the
hospital

table
lurches
hard
the
camera
pans
around

and
closes
in
on
her
face

angelus
has
dropped
his
sword
and
holds
his
cut
buffy
does
a
high
kick
to
his
face
and
he
falls
backward
into
acathla
and
lands
on
his
knees
before
her
cut
to
the
hospital
acum
now
the
orb
glows
brightly
for
a
brief
moment
and
goes
dark
willow
suddenly
relaxes
and
looks
around
blankly
cut
to
the
mansion
buffy
raises
her
sword
to
dispatch
angelus
but
stays
herself
when
he
suddenly
gasps
loudly
and
groans
in
pain
she
sees
his
eyes
glow
bright
red
for
an
instant
and
go
back
dark
he
looks
up
at
her
but
quickly
collapses
to
the
floor
crying
buffy
stares
down
at
him
but
still
holds
her
sword
raised
behind
her
angel
raises
himself
back
up
his
eyes
heavy
with
tears
and
looks
into
her
eyes
angel
softly
buffy
angel
sobs
what's
going
on
she
just
looks
at
him
confused
but
not
yet
ready
to
lower
the
sword
he
looks
around
a
bit
and
gets
to
his
feet
where
are
we
ii
don't
remember
finally
buffy
realizes
that
the
curse
has
worked
and
she
slowly
lowers
her
sword
buffy
softly
angel
angel
sees
her
wound
you're
hurt
she
looks
down
at
her
wound
and
feels
his
gentle
touch
on
her
arm
she
ignores
her
cut
looks
back
up
at
him
and
steps
closer
he
embraces
her
tightly
oh
buffy
god
she
still
isn't
completely
sure
that
it's
true
but
accepts
the
hug
i
i
feel
like
i
haven't
seen
you
in
months
finally
she
accepts
it
closes
her
eyes
and
breathes
out
a
deep
sigh
oh
my
god
everything's
so
muddled
i
he
holds
her
even
more
closely
oh
he
sighs
deeply
and
kisses
her
on
the
shoulder
oh
buffy
she
cries
into
his
shoulder
and
hugs
him
back
behind
him
acathla
lets
out
a
low
rumble
buffy
opens
her
eyes
and
stares
in
shock
as
acathla's
face
contorts
his
brows
angle
down
his
eyes
glow
red
his
mouth
opens
grotesquely
and
the
swirling
vortex
to
hell
opens
small
at
first
but
growing
steadily
in
size
and
emanating
a
deep
red
glow
buffy
lets
go
of
angel
and
looks
up
into
his
face
angel
confused
what's
happening
buffy
whispers
reassuringly
shh
don't
worry
about
it
she
brushes
her
fingers
over
his
lips
and
across
his
cheek
she
lays
her
hand
on
his
cheek
and
kisses
him
softly
he
returns
the
kiss
and
it
becomes
more
passionate
behind
them
the
vortex
has
grown
to
about
five
feet
15
m
across
and
continues
to
get
larger
buffy
breaks
off
the
kiss
and
looks
deeply
into
angel's
eyes
buffy
whispers
i
love
you
angel
whispers
i
love
you
she
touches
his
lips
with
her
fingers
again
close
your
eyes
she
nods
reassuringly
and
he
closes
his
eyes
she
tries
hard
not
to
start
crying
and
kisses
him
again
gently
she
steps
back
draws
back
her
sword
and
thrusts
it
into
his
chest
his
eyes
whip
open
in
surprise
and
pain
and
a
bright
light
emanates
from
the
sword
she
steps
away
from
him
he
reaches
out
to
her
and
looks
down
at
the
sword
thrust
completely
through
him
he
looks
at
her
imploringly
completely
bewildered
by
this
turn
of
events
she
can
only
stare
at
the
sword
protruding
from
his
chest
and
slowly
steps
further
back
buffy
behind
him
the
power
of
the
sword
begins
to
swirl
into
the
vortex
buffy
steps
further
back
still
looking
only
at
the
sword
in
his
chest
and
not
into
his
face
the
vortex
has
enlarged
to
about
twelve
feet
35
m
across
and
the
two
energies
begin
to
interact
angel
still
holds
out
his
hand
to
buffy
when
the
vortex
finally
meets
him
it
suddenly
closes
into
acathla's
mouth
without
so
much
as
a
spark
taking
him
with
it
buffy
stares
at
the
stone
demon
for
a
long
moment
a
light
of
awareness
dawning
in
her
eyes
as
she
truly
realizes
what
she
has
done
what
she
has
lost
she
begins
to
sob
her
heart
breaking
in
the
background
full
of
grace
by
sarah
mclachlan
begins
to
play
over
the
scene
the
winter
here
is
cold
dissolve
to
buffy's
street
she
walks
across
it
toward
her
house
and
bitter
it's
chilled
us
to
the
bone
we
haven't
seen
the
sun
for
weeks
too
long
too
far
from
home
she
looks
at
the
neighboring
houses
then
back
at
hers
cut
into
the
house
joyce
climbs
the
steps
and
looks
down
the
hall
at
buffy's
door
i
feel
just
like
i'm
sinking
joyce
buffy
and
i
claw
for
solid
ground
she
walks
to
buffy's
room
and
looks
in
the
windows
are
open
and
some
of
her
daughter's
things
are
strewn
on
the
bed
she
steps
in
and
looks
around
i'm
pulled
down
by
the
undertow
she
sees
a
note
on
the
bed
among
a
bunch
of
clothes
i
never
thought
i
could
feel
so
low
she
picks
up
the
note
and
reads
and
oh
darkness
i
feel
like
letting
go
she
begins
to
cry
as
she
reads
and
sits
down
on
the
bed
if
all
of
the
strength
and
all
of
the
courage
come
and
lift
me
from
this
place
cut
to
sunnydale
high
school
xander
and
giles

up
to
oz
pushing

side

a
bit

and
squints
well
we
uh
we
went
back
to
the
mansion
iit
was
empty
um
and
acathla
was
was
dormant
i
think
the
spell
worked
i
felt
something
go
through
me
plus
the
orb
did
that
cool
glow
thing
well
maybe
it
wasn't
in
time
maybe
she
had
to
kill
him
before
the
cure
could
work
well
then
she'd
wanna
be
alone
i
guess
or
maybe
angel
was
saved
and
they
want
to
be
alone
together
perhaps
well
she's
gotta
show
up
sooner
or
later
we
still
have
school
yeah
willow
looks
around
for
her
she'll
be
here
in
a
while
where
everything
we
said
and
did
hurts
us
all
the
more
they
all
turn
and
head
into
the
school
it's
just
that
we
stayed
too
long
in
the
same
old
sickly
skin
cut
to
buffy
looking
at
the
school
from
behind
a
tree
she
watches
them
as
they
go
in
i'm
pulled
down
by
the
undertow
i
never
thought
i
could
feel
so
low
the
camera
pans
around
her
to
her
face
looking
sadly
at
the
school
a
light
breeze
sweeps
her
hair
back
and
oh
darkness
i
feel
like
letting
go
she
turns
around
and
walks
away
down
the
street
without
looking
back
if
all
of
the
strength
and
all
of
the
courage
come
and
lift
me
from
this
place
dissolve
to
the
inside
of
a
bus
buffy's
reflection
is
visible
in
the
window
as
it
drives
by
her
house
i
know
i
can
love
you
much
better
than
this
full
of

looks
out
the

calmly
as
the

drives
on
cut
to
a
twolane
road
leading
out

the
bus
passes
under
