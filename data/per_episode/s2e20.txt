sunnydale
state
beach
at
night
there
is
a
large
party
going
on
with
about
fifty
students
in
attendance
mann's
chinese
by
naked
plays
in
the
background
the
camera
pans
from
a
few
parked
cars
through
the
crowd
of
students
laughing
and
celebrating
and
stops
at
a
fire
where
xander
cordelia
and
willow
are
warming
themselves
all
i'm
saying
is
it's
a
stupid
idea
to
have
a
victory
party
at
the
beach
it's
officially
nippy
xander
looks
down
at
himself
so
say
my
nips
i
think
it's
festive
a
party
with
nature
well
it's
the
team's
choice
it
was
their
victory
team
swim
team
xander
chuckles
hardly
what
i'd
call
a
team
the
yankees
abbott
and
costello
the
'a'
now
those
were
teams
jealous
no
yyes
but
'no'
more
than
'yes'
a
member
of
the
swim
team
staggers
by
with
a
girl
under
each
arm
i
mean
look
at
that
xander
indicates
them
dodd
mcalvy
last
month
he's
the
freak
with
jicama
breath
who
waxes
his
back
he
wins
a
few
meets
and
suddenly
inherits
the
cool
gene
well
all
i
know
is
my
cheerleading
squad
wasted
a
lot
of
pep
on
losers
it's
about
time
our
school
excelled
at
something
hmm
you're
forgetting
our
high
mortality
rate
cordelia
smiles
at
that
xander
pumps
his
fist
we're
number
one
xander
looks
around
huh
he
gets
a
few
positive
responses
from
nearby
students
the
camera
pans
from
them
over
to
buffy
sitting
by
herself
behind
a
pile
of
sand
and
staring
out
over
the
ocean
with
a
tunedout
look
on
her
face
after
a
moment
another
member
of
the
swim
team
approaches
her
from
behind
beautiful
cameron
stands
behind
her

it
buffy
still
staring
at
the
ocean

just

true
mother
giving
birth
to
new
life
and
devouring
old
cameron

always
adaptable
and
nurturing
yet
constant
and
merciless
buffy
looks
at
him

a
week

he
shoves
jonathon's
head
back
into
the
tub
suddenly
a
hand
appears
on
his
shoulder
and
pulls
him
up
raising
his
short
sleeve
in
the
process
he
has
a
tattoo
of
a
meanfaced
shark
smoking
a
cigar
on

jonathon
leaves
buffy
sighs
see

fun
to
hang
out
with

cut
to
dodd
and
gage
walking
further
down
the
beach
i
can't
believe
buffy
man
that
girl
gives
me
the
creeps
he
lags
behind
a
bit
and
then
stops
staring
out
over
the
ocean
as
gage
continues
to
walk
he
looks
back
and
forth
with
his
eyes
between
the
ocean
and
gage
walking
ahead
of
him
after
a
long
pause
he
continues
to
walk
as
well
cut
to
gage
he
smells
something
and
stops
in
his
tracks
he
takes
another
sniff
of
the
ranksmelling
air
oh
dude
what
is
that
foulness
he
looks
behind
him
and
sees
that
dodd
has
disappeared
hey
dodd
gage
looks
around
the
other
way
dude
gage
gives
up
huh
he
goes
on
to
the
group
of
people
gathered
under
the
pier
the
camera
stops
following
him
and
pans
up
the
beach
a
muffled
scream
can
be
heard
followed
by
some
tearing
sounds
and
painful
moaning
finally
a
deep
growl
is
heard
as
the
camera
reaches
dodd
or
at
least
what's
left
of
him
it's
just
a
pile
of
rippedup
clothes
and
torn
and
bloody
skin
steaming
in
the
cold
night
air
the
camera
stops
on
his
shark
tattoo
for
a
moment
then
pans
up
to
a
large
storm
drain
coming
out
of
the
hillside
a
hunchedover
creature
walks
into
it
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

computer
science
class
at
sunnydale
high
school
the
camera
focuses
on
a
pie
chart
appearing
on
a
student's
screen
willow
walks
up
the
aisle
and
the
camera
follows
her
through
the
classroom
as
she
looks
around
at
the
students'
work
okay
good
pie
charts
everyone
willow
looks
at
another
good
willow
looks
at
another
all
good
thanks
willow
continues
on
nice
willow
walks
around
another
good
willow
looks
at
gage's
pc
gage
your
pie
chart
is
looking
a
lot
like
solitaire
willow
looks
closer
with
naked
ladies
on
the
cards
gage
looks
up
at
her
what's
your
point
the
bell
rings
and
gage
gets
up
to
go
no
point
principal
snyder
walks
into
the
room
past
the
leaving
students
he
spots
gage
and
stops
nice
work
in
yesterday's
meet
son
now
let's
go
for
it
snyder
pumps
his
fist
gage
gives
him
an
acknowledging
nod
and
continues
out
of
the
classroom
snyder
turns
his
attention
to
willow
uh
hi
there
sir
rosenberg
how's
the
class
everything
in
order
willow
worried
well
actually
snyder
interrupts
great
i've
been
talking
to
the
board
we've
been
having
trouble
finding
a
competent
teacher
this
late
in
the
term
do
you
think
you
could
continue
subbing
through
finals
willow
smiles
oh
sure
i
like
teaching
isn't
that
nice
you're
a
team
player
and
i
like
that
a
team
player
wants
everyone
on
the
team
to
succeed
wants
everyone
to
pass
well
yeah
sure
willow
goes
to
her
desk
snyder
follows
her
i
understand
there's
a
problem
with
gage
petronzi
he
stops
at
one
of
the
pc's
and
looks
at
it
with
his
back
to
willow
oh
good
then
you
know
well
yeah
besides
the
behavior
problem
he
won't
do
homework
and
his
test
scores
are
snyder
looks
up
exasperated
not
wanting
to
hear
this
well
actually
he
doesn't
have
any
test
scores
because
he
never
shows
up
when
we
have
snyder
turns
to
her
and
interrupts
i'm
not
interested
in
any
of
that
i'm
interested
in
why
when
this
school
is
on
the
brink
of
winning
its
first
state
championship
in
fifteen
years
you
slap
a
crucial
member
of
that
team
with
a
failing
mark
that
would
force
his
removal
is
that
how
you
show
your
school
spirit
willow
flustered
yes
well
i
mean
no
i'm
just
trying
to
grade
fairly
gage
is
a
champion
he's
under
more
pressure
than
the
other
students
and
i
think
we
need
to
cut
him
some
slack
he
starts
to
leave
the
classroom
willow
considers
his
words
for
a
moment
you're
asking
me
to
change
his
grade
willow
faces
him
snyder
stops
and
turns
back
i
never
said
any
such
thing
snyder
steps
over
to
her
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
you
recheck
your
figures
and
i
think
we'll
find
a
grade
more
fitting
to
an
athlete
of
gage's
stature
perhaps
something
in
a
'd'
he
turns
and
leaves
willow
is
unsure
of
how
to
deal
with
what
he
just
told
her
cut
to
the
halls
xander
cordelia
and
willow
come
down
the
stairs
and
walk
down
the
hall
just
like
that
he
actually
told
you
to
alter
his
grade
exactly
except
for
actually
telling
me
to
but
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
of
what
he
wasn't
telling
me
that
is
wrong
a
big
fat
spanking
wrong
it's
a
slap
in
the
face
to
every
one
of
us
who
studied
hard
and
worked
long
hours
to
earn
our
d's
xander
i
know
you
take
pride
in
being
the
voice
of
the
common
wuss
but
the
truth
is
certain
people
are
entitled
to
special
privileges
they're
called
winners
that's
the
way
the
world
works
and
what
about
that
nutty
'all
men
are
created
equal'
thing
propaganda
spouted
out
by
the
ugly
and
less
deserving
i
think
that
was
lincoln
cordelia
exhales
disgusting
mole
and
stupid
hat
actually
it
was
jefferson
kept
slaves
remember
you
know
what
really
grates
my
cheese
that
buffy's
not
here
to
share
my
moral
outrage
about
swim
team
perks
cut
to
cameron's
mustang
pulling
up
to
the
school
buffy
is
in
the
passenger's
seat
she's
too
busy
being
one
of
them
i
don't
know
a
dolphin
a
dolphin
in
the
ocean
because
you
know
when
i'm
in
the
vastness
of
the
ocean
it's
cameron
they
pull
to
a
stop
it's
like
i'm
never
alone
he
turns
off
the
engine
and
leans
against
his
door
to
face
buffy
she
leans
her
elbow
against
her
door
with
her
head
propped
up
on
her
hand
you
ever
hear
of
a
woman
named
gertrude
ederle
no
no
i
can't
say
that
i
have
cam
first
woman
to
swim
the
english
channel
cameron
buffy
nods
slowly
bored
same
thing
i
mean
she
would
talk
to
it
i
mean
she'd
carry
on
entire
conversations
with
it
sometimes
i
do
that
i
mean
once
i
was
out
in
buffy
sits
up
you
know
what
cam
thanks
i'd
forgotten
how
nice
it
is
to
just
talk
or
in
my
case
listen
without
any
romantic
pressure
hey
i'm
not
about
pressure
i
just
want
you
to
be
comfortable
buffy
smiles
i'm
comfy
i'm
so
comfy
i'm
nodding
off
actually
which
is
why
cameron
interrupts
are
you
wearing
a
bra
cameron
looks
at
her
suggestively
buffy
in
disbelief
what
cameron
grins
come
on
i
mean
tell
me
you
haven't
been
thinking
about
this
ever
since
last
night
what
i'm
thinking
about
is
that
i
should
probably
get
out
of
this
car
she
reaches
for
the
door
lever
but
cameron
quickly
hits
the
master
lock
button
locking
her
in
relax
i'm
not
gonna
hurt
you
oh
it's
not
me
i'm
worried
about
cameron
snickers
you
like
it
rough
he
reaches
over
to
put
his
arm
around
her
and
she
grabs
it
and
pulls
him
down
toward
her
ow
with
her
other
hand
she
grabs
the
back
of
his
neck
and
jerks
him
up
oh
she
smashes
his
head
into
the
steering
wheel
the
horn
honks
oh
he
sits
up
and
holds
his
nose
in
pain
ah
buffy
notices
principal
snyder
outside
of
the
car
he
walks
up
to
the
front
and
looks
in
through
the
windshield
at
her
oh
you
broke
my
nose
buffy
cringes
at
the
sight
of
principal
snyder
ah
snyder
raises
his
hand
and
motions
with
his
finger
for
her
to
come
with
him
cameron
groans
in
pain
cut
to
nurse
greenleigh's
office
she
slams
a
cold
pack
onto
a
table
to
start
the
chemical
reaction
and
kneads
it
a
little
before
holding
it
up
to
cameron's
nose
and
gently
laying
it
on
ow
he
takes
hold
of
it
and
the
nurse
leaves
him
alone
the
camera
pans
over
to
buffy
i
wasn't
the
attacker
principal
snyder
i
was
the
attacked
that's
not
how
it
looked
from
where
i
was
standing
i
don't
know
what
happened
i
mean
first
she
leads
me
on
then
she
goes
schizo
on
me
buffy
steps
over
to
him
lead
you
on
when
did
i
lead
you
on
oh
come
on
cameron
to
snyder
i
mean
look
at
the
way
she
dresses
she
looks
down
at
herself
the
door
opens
and
the
swim
team
coach
carl
marin
comes
in
buffy
steps
back
and
leans
against
a
table
coach
how
we
doing
cameron
coach
marin
goes
to
him
snyder
follows
coach
marin
how
bad
does
it
look
well
luckily
it's
not
broken
but
sure
as
hell
it's
gonna
sting
for
a
few
days
snyder
leads
the
coach
away
from
cam
i
mean
our
chances
of
winning
the
state
championship
oh
can
we
still
do
it
i'm
gonna
need
cameron
back
at
a
hundred
and
ten
percent
uh
he's
my
best
swimmer
now
with
dodd
uh
what
happened
to
dodd
that's
none
of
your
concern
you'd
better
hope
that
boy's
nose
heals
before
the
meet
this
friday
coach
marin
goes
to
cam
walker
i
want
you
to
hit
the
steam
room
as
soon
as
you're
done
here
and
try
to
keep
those
sinuses
clear
coach
marin
to
the
nurse
take
care
of
my
boy
ruthie
i
always
do
coach
marin
steps
over
to
buffy
and
you
try
to
dress
more
appropriately
from
now
on
this
isn't
a
dance
club
he
leaves
the
office
snyder
gives
buffy
a
look
and
follows
the
coach
out
cameron
looks
over
at
her
and
grins
cut
to
the
library
buffy
stands
between
the
cage
and
the
table
and
talks
toward
the
table
behind
the
camera
so
i'm
treated
like
the
baddie
just
because
he
has
a
sprained
wrist
and
a
bloody
nose
buffy
considers
and
i
don't
have
a
scratch
on
me
which
granted
hurts
my
case
a
little
on
the
surface
but
meanwhile
he
gets
away
with
it
because
he's
on
the
'aren't
we
the
most'
swim
team
the
camera
cuts
to
show
xander
giles
and
willow
studying
a
number
of
books
at
the
table
they
all
look
up
at
her
who
by
the
way
if
no
one's
noticed
have
been
acting
like
real
jerks
lately
she
notices
their
expressions
of
impatience
and
tries
to
find
some
sympathy
there
they
have
none
to
give
so
buffy
giggles
nervously
anything
new
with
you
guys
buffy
sits
thank
you
for
taking
an
interest
apparently
some
remains
were
found
on
the
beach
this
morning
some
human
remains
dodd
mcalvy's
remains
vampire
no
no
he
was
eviscerated
nothing
left
but
skin
and
cartilage
in
other
words
this
was
no
boating
accident
so
something
ripped
him
open
and
ate
out
his
insides
like
an
oreo
cookie
willow
xander
shoots
her
a
look
well
except
for
you
know
without
the
chocolatey
cookie
goodness
yes
um
principal
snyder
has
has
asked
the
faculty
to
keep
the
news
quiet
for
now
um
so
as
not
to
unduly
upset
the
students
for
'students'
read
'swim
team'
so
we're
looking
for
a
beastie
that
uh
eats
humans
whole
except
for
the
skin
giles
looks
into
his
book
this
doesn't
make
any
sense
yeah
the
skin's
the
best
part
any
demons
with
high
cholesterol
giles
slowly
turns
to
her
and
gives
her
a
look
buffy
points
at
giles
you're
gonna
think
about
that
later
mister
and
you're
gonna
laugh
cut
to
the
steam
room
in
the
boy's
locker
room
cameron
sits

walks
in

slowly
walks
through
while
looking
around
the
place

a
shambles
with
tables
and
chairs
knocked
over
everywhere
he
sniffs
the
air
and
looks
down
as
he
passes
a
table
there
he
sees
cameron's
remains
just
a
pile
of
torn
clothes
and
steaming
skin
oh
my
god
he
puts
his
hand
over
his
mouth
in
shock
and
fights
back
his
urge
to
vomit
he
straightens
back
up
and
turns
to
go
standing
there
blocking
his
way
is
a
dark
green
humanoid
sea
monster
with
catfish
whiskers
sharp
teeth
and
three
scaly
ridges
across
the
top
of
its
head
roaring

the
library
xander
is
standing
behind
cordelia
sitting
at
the
table
and
watches
her
sketch
the
monster
he
saw
no
no
no
the
mouth's
a
lot
bigger
and
downward
like
this
she
looks
at
him
make
a
face
with
the
corners
of
his
mouth
turned
down
and
she
sighs
with
more
teeth
she's
had
enough
she
puts
the
sketchpad
down
gets
up
and
goes
over
to
giles
at
the
counter
i'm
doing
the
best
i
can
giles
takes
off
his
glasses
and
looks
up
from
his
book
over
at
xander
is
that
what
you
saw
xander
xander
picks
up
and
looks
at
the
sketch
y
yeah
xander
considers
i
think
so
xander
considers
some
more
pretty
much
aaaaare
you
sure
cordelia
faces
xander
and
crosses
her
arms
well
it
was
dark
and
the
thing
went
through
the
window
so
quick
and
i
was
a
little
shocked
when
i
saw
it
and
go
ahead
say
it
you
ran
like
a
woman
cordelia
grins
hey
if
you
saw
this
thing
you'd
run
like
a
woman
too
willow
and
buffy
come
into
the
library
and
head
for
the
counter
buffy
was
right
according
to
the
statistics
dodd
and
cameron
were
the
best
swimmers
on
the
team
willow
hands
giles
the
figures
first
and
second
actually
which
means
if
my
theory's
correct
gage
petronzi
the
thirdbest
swimmer
on
the
team
would
be
the
next
item
on
the
menu
god
this
is
so
sad
we're
never
gonna
win
the
state
championship
i
think
i've
lost
all
will
to
cheerlead
xander
goes
to
the
counter
raise
your
hand
if
you
feel
her
pain
cordelia
gives
him
a
disgusted
look
if
you're
saying
these
killings
aren't
random
it
would
suggest
someone's
out
for
revenge
and
raise
the
possibility
that
someone
brought
forth
this
sea
monster
from
whence
it
came
to
exact
that
revenge
buffy
reconsiders
her
words
'from
whence
it
came'
buffy
willow
smiles
buffy
to
giles
i'm
spending
way
too
much
time
around
you
who
would
hate
the
swim
team
that
much
though
xander
gets
looks
from
buffy
and
cordelia
besides
me
i
mean
willow
raises
her
hand
ooo
willow
jonathon
he
was
bullied
by
dodd
the
other
day
on
the
beach
remember
he
did
say
he
could
take
care
of
things
himself
it's
a
good
call
you
should
question
him
willow
smiles
really
me
willow
menacingly
i'll
crack
him
like
an
egg
meanwhile
i
think
uh
swimmer
number
three
might
benefit
from
your
watchful
eye
and
protection
discreetly
of
course
i'm
on
it
buffy
leaves
what
about
me
what
can
i
do
well
you
could
go
out
to
the
parking
lot
and
practice
running
like
a
man
xander
hugs
his
arms
around
himself
to
protect
against
the
sting
of
her
words
cut
to
the
student
lounge
gage
is
sitting
and
playing
with
his
gameboy
on
one
of
the
couches
with
his
feet
up
on
the
table
the
camera
pulls
back
until
buffy
is
also
in
view
sitting
in
a
chair
and
watching
him
while
pretending
to
read
a
magazine
gage
can
feel
her
eyes
on
him
and
shoots
her
a
glance
buffy
quickly
jerks
her
head
back
to
stare
into
her
magazine
gage
shakes
the
feeling
off
and
goes
back
to
his
gameboy
buffy
slowly
turns
her
head
to
watch
him
again
cut
to
willow's
classroom
jonathon
is
sitting
in
a
chair
at
the
front
of
the
room
willow
aims
a
reading
lamp
at
him
the
camera
pans
from
it
up
to
her
face
determined
to
get
what
she
wants
out
of
him
so
jonathon
willow
crosses
her
arms
you
tried
out
for
the
swim
team
twice
and
never
made
it
jonathon
fidgets
i'm
asthmatic
i
couldn't
keep
up
you
resented
it
didn't
you
maybe
willow
approaches
him
you
hated
being
pushed
around
by
dodd
and
the
others
so
willow
walks
around
to
his
other
side
so
you
wanted
revenge
didn't
you
willow
leans
in
suddenly
willow
sternly
didn't
you
jonathon
nervously
yeah
okay
i
did
willow
smiles
and
straightens
back
up
so
you
delved
into
the
black
arts
and
conjured
up
a
hellbeast
from
the
ocean's
depths
to
wreak
your
vengeance
huh
didn't
you
jonathon
confused
what
no
i
snuck
in
yesterday
and
peed
in
the
pool
willow

but
i
know
they'd
want
their
friends
to
go
on
and
win
that
state
championship
it's
time
to
think
about
the
team
well
i
don't
have
a
complete
team
as
it
is
if
we
don't
find
someone
by
this
afternoon's
tryouts
we
won't
be
eligible
to
compete
you'll
find
someone
snyder
they
continue
all
he
has
to
do
is
wear
a
bathing
suit
right
the
camera
follows
them
for
a
moment
and
then
stops
on
xander
he
overheard
and
he
looks
back
and
watches
them
go
cut
to
the
bronze
there's
a
dj
tonight
and
no
cover
charge
people
come
and
go
cut
inside
the
dj

nero's
rome
buffy

at
the
bar
sucking
on
a
drink
and
watching
gage
at
a
pool
table
practicing
shots
by
himself
if
you'd
listen
we
wouldn't
have
to
go
through
this
gage
takes
a
shot
and
makes
it
he
walks
around
the
table
for
his
next
one
if
you'd
just
let
me
finish
stop
cuttin'
and
jumpin'
ahead
gage
bends
down
and
makes
his
next
shot
yeah
if
you'd
just
shut
your
pretty
mouth
you'd
save
yourself
some
tears
buffy
is
bored
at
the
bar
and
gets
up
she
looks
around
nonchalantly
and
walks
closer
to
the
table
then
gets
behind
a
pillar
and
peeks
out
from
behind
it
at
gage
her
change
of
position
is
not
lost
on
gage
and
he
stiffens
up
frustrated
at
being
watched
so
closely
he
shoots
her
a
look
and
she
quickly
looks
away
gage
has
had
enough
he
puts
down
his
pool
cue
and
walks
around
behind
the
pillar
you
came
back
from
the
bathroom
buffy
peeks
back
at
the
pool
table
and
sees
he's
gone
she
steps
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
pillar
to
look
around
and
practically
runs
into
gage
with
somethin'
on
your
shoe
she
steps
back
over
to
the
pool
table
side
of
the
pillar
and
gage
follows
her
around
the
other
way

outside

notches
yeah
that'd
be
sweet
anyone
in
mind
you're

luck
my
friend
gage
turns
to
look
at
angelus
and
sees
that
he
has
disappeared
just
so
happens
gage
turns
back
quickly
and
sees
angelus
standing
there
in
front
of
him
in
his
game
face
i'm
recruiting
gage
looks
horrified
as
angelus
grabs
him
and
bites
his
neck

buffy
strolls
out
of
the
bronze
and
hears
gage's
screams
ah

she
rushes
to
his
aid

and
begins
to
spit
out
his
blood
he
wipes
his
mouth
and
spits
some
more
buffy
comes
running
around
the
corner
and
just
as
he
looks
up
she
does
a
roundhouse
kick
to
his
face
he
isn't
fazed
and
just
looks
at
her
she
pulls
out
the
stick
holding
her
hair
up
and
holds
it
ready
to
stake
him
as
her
hair
falls
down
around
her
face
why
miss
summers
you're
beautiful
he
quickly
bends
down
picks
gage
up
and
throws
him
at
her
knocking
her
to
the
pavement
he
spits
a
few
more
times
and
leaves
smiling
buffy
scrambles
to
her
feet
and
watches
him
go
gage
gets
up
also
and
rubs
his
neck
oh
was
that
the
thing
that
killed
cameron
no
that
was
something
else
gage
confused
ssomething
else
yeah
unfortunately
we
have
a
lot
of
something
elses
in
this
town
good
night
buffy
goes
gage
looks
back
and
forth
between
buffy
and
the
direction
angelus
went
hey
buffy
stops
and
looks
back
at
him
he
goes
over
to
her
gage
laughs
nervously
walk
me
home
she
motions
for
him
to
follow
and
they
leave
cut
to
the
pool
at
sunnydale
high
school
six
members
of
the
swim
team
are
on
the
blocks
ready
to
start
a
heat
swimmers
take
position
they
all
bend
down
to
dive
in
the
coach
blows
his
whistle
and
they're
off
he
walks
along
the
edge
of
the
pool
past
the
stands
as
they
swim
willow
buffy
and
cordelia
are
watching
from
the
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
pool
gage
stops
stands
up
and
lifts
off
his
goggles
keep
the
stroking
up
alright
keep
it
going
keep
it
going
all
the
way
to
the
end
all
the
way
to
the
end
breathe
deep
gage
sees
buffy
in
the
stands
and
waves
to
her
the
coach
blows
his
whistle
buffy
waves
back
to
gage
discreetly
but
willow
notices
and
gives
her
a
smile
buffy
looks
back
at
her
with
a
smile
gage
you
with
us
or
not
coach
marin
gage
swims
off
c'mon
let's
go
cordelia
to
buffy
so
he
spit
it
out
i
thought
angel
liked
blood
he
used
to
maybe
his
eyes
were
too
big
for
his
stomach
or
maybe
there
was
something
in
gage's
blood
that
angel
didn't
like
say
for
example
steroids
that
would
explain
all
their
behavioral
changes
and
their
winning
streak
so
maybe
whatever's
in
their
blood
is
what's
attracting
this
creature
to
them
any
luck
researching
our
fish
monster
zippo
we
couldn't
find
any
sea
demon
that
matched
the
description
that
xander
gave
us
not
that
chicken
little's
much
of
a
witness
but
her
eye
is
caught
by
a
swimmer
coming
out
of
the
locker
room
oh
the
camera
cuts
to
a
shot
of
the
swimmer's
knees
and
pans
up
along
his
athletic
legs
past
his
crimson
speedo's
and
tight
abs
and
up
to
his
hairless
chest
oh

of
the

the
swimmer's

cordelia

xander
when
he
hears
their
voices
he
scrambles
over
to
a
pile
of
kickboards
grabs
the
one
off
the
top
and
hides
himself
behind
it
the
girls

and
goes
to
join
the
rest
of
the
team
covering
his
butt
with
his
free
hand
he
lamely
tosses
the
kickboard
back
onto
the
pile
but
it
just
falls
off
he
reaches
the
others
and
listens
in
on
what
the
assistant
swim
coach
is
saying
cordelia
smiles
proudly
i'm
dating
a
swimmer
from
the
sunnydale
swim
team
you
can
die
happy
she
and
willow
watch
as
xander
gets
up
on
a
starting
block
and
puts
on
his
swim
cap
buffy
to
willow
what
about
jonathon
is
he
involved
oh
no
he
just
sort
of
peed
in
the
pool
oh
the
girls
look
back
at
xander
to
watch
as
he
dives
in
his
dive
is
a
bit
sloppy
but
not
at
all
bad
the
girls
all
look
on
in
wideeyed
shock
as
they
realize
what
he
just
dove
into
buffy
cringes
oh
cut
to
the
steam
room
after
practice
the
camera
looks
in
through
the
window
from
the
locker
room
xander
joins
the
others
and
finds
an
available
spot
don't
you
guys
get
claustrophobic
in
here
xander
sits
i
mean
what's
the
deal
you
perspire
a
lot
you
can't
breathe
oor
read
i
mean
i
guess
you
could
but
the
pages
would
probably
get
all
wet
the
camera
pans
down
from
the
window
to
a
grate
in
the
floor
of
the
locker
room
several
green
clawed
fingers
poke
through
and
lift
up
the
grating
cut
to
the
halls
outside
of
the
locker
room
buffy
waits
for
xander
and
gage
to
come
out
she
leans
against
the
wall
and
exhales
a
moment
later
xander
comes
out
with
a
towel
over
his
head
rubbing
his
hair
dry
you
gotta
love
this
undercover
deal
twenty
minutes
in
a
hot
room
with
a
bunch
of
sweaty
guys
where's
gage
i
don't
know
he
was
right
behind
me
putting
his
sneakers
on
but
it's
not
the
velcro
kind
so
give
him
a
couple
of
extra
minutes
taps
her
on
the
shoulder
tag
you're
it
leaves
buffy
sighs
and
resigns
herself
to
waiting
cut
to
the
locker
room
gage
is
tying
his
shoes
on
a
changing
bench
he
sniffs
smelling
something
foul
he
sniffs
at
his
own
armpits
to
see
if
it
isn't
himself
he
smells
it's
not
and
he
gets
up
to
investigate
he
walks
through
the
locker
room
looking
around
passing
the
steam
room
and
the
whirlpool
bath
the
smell
gets
stronger
as
he
goes
down
a
row
of
lockers
he
sniffs
deeply
outside
of
one
and
opens
it
cut
to
the
hall
buffy
is
still
waiting
for
gage
to
come
out
suddenly
she
hears
him
scream
oh
my
god
she
wastes
no
time
running
into
the
locker
room
cut
to
the
locker
room
one
of
the
monsters
stands
before
gage
it
roars
as
he
screams
help
me
help
me
ah
help
me
buffy
comes
rushing
in
and
pushes
the
terrified
gage
away
from
the
monster
the
creature
roars
and
buffy
confronts
it
with
a
look
of
disgust
but
it
just
stands
there
and
doesn't
move
to
attack
her
behind
her
gage
has
collapsed
to
the
floor
and
continues
to
scream
not
in
fear
anymore
but
instead
in
agony
and
writhes
on
the
floor
in
pain
buffy
looks
back
at
gage
concerned
gage
he
reaches
out
to
her
for
help
but
can't
get
up
and
continues
to
convulse
buffy
takes
a
step
closer
but
then
stops
and
stares
at
him
in
shock
he
has
managed
to
get
to
his
knees
and
pulls
open
his
shirt
then
he
grabs
at
his
chest
and
begins
to
tear
open
his
skin
beneath
is
the
chest
of
another
monster
gage
holds
up
his
hand
and
watches
as
the
skin
tears
along
the
back
and
a
green
clawed
hand
emerges
buffy
takes
a
quick
look
behind
her
at
the
other
monster
but
it's
not
advancing
so
she
turns
back
to
gage
and
continues
to
watch
dumbfounded
the
monster
that
was
gage
now
stands
up
and
what's
left
of
gage's
clothes
and
skin
fall
away
from
him
buffy
stares
up
at
it
in
horror
and
starts
to
back
off
it
roars
advances
on
her
and
takes
a
swipe
at
her
with
its
sharp
claws
the
first
monster
advances
on
her
from
behind
now
and
she
finds
herself
trapped
between
them
part
3

the
boys'
locker
room
buffy
is
trapped
between
the
two
sea
creatures
she
does
a
roundhouse
kick
to
the
one
behind
her
and
uses
her
angular
momentum
to
follow
up
with
a
high
kick
to
the
other
one
knocking
it
to
the
floor
she
grabs
a
trashcan
and
throws
it
at
the
first
one
but
it
just
deflects
the
can
buffy
grabs
a
mop
leaning
against
the
wall
and
thrusts
it
at
the
second
monster
as
it
gets
up
spins
around
with
it
to
hit
the
first
one
in
the
face
knocking
it
down
and
then
jabs
the
other
one
again
in
the
side
it
is
momentarily
stunned
and
buffy
follows
up
with
another
swing
of
the
mop
to
its
back
and
a
kick
to
its
chest
making
it
fall
to
the
floor
the
first
creature
is
back
up
grabs
buffy
from
behind
turns
her
around
and
sinks
its
sharp
teeth
deeply
into
her
arm
she
screams
out
in
pain
the
monster
shoves
her
away
into
a
bank
of
lockers
and
she
falls
to
the
floor
coach
marin
suddenly
appears
and
quickly
helps
her
to
her
feet
the
two
monsters
give
up
the
fight
and
launch
themselves
across
the
floor
and
slide
one
after
the
other
into
the
stillopen
grate
cut
to
the
school
nurse's
office
she
finishes
bandaging
buffy's
arm
giles
and
the
coach
are
standing
behind
her
by
the
window
i
don't
think
that
this
is
going
to
need
stitches
but
you
might
wanna
have
your
family
physician
take
a
look
at
it
nurse
greenleigh
walks
off
giles
approaches
buffy
how
are
you
i'm
definitely
feeling
the
burn
giles
to
coach
marin
well
the
uh
good
news
is
that
it
would
appear
that
none
of
your
team
actually
died
but
the
bad
news
is
they're
monsters
how
could
this
happen
are
you
saying
you
don't
know
well
you
work
so
hard
you
start
to
win
suddenly
you
think
it's
just
you
you're
inspiring
the
boys
to
greatness
but
in
the
back
of
your
mind
you
start
to
wonder
you
never
asked
any
of
the
boys
if
they
were
taking
anything
maybe
i
was
afraid
to
buffy
and
giles
exchange
a
look
cut
to
willow's
classroom
she
buffy
and
xander
are
at
the
computer
surfing
through
the
school
medical
files
there
dodd
mcalvy
torn
tendon
gage
petronzi
fractured
wrist
depression
headaches
it's
all
there
in
the
school
medical
records
all
symptomatic
of
steroid
abuse
but
is
steroid
abuse
usually
linked
with
'hey
i'm
a
fish'
there
must
be
something
else
in
the
mix
but
the
point
is
these
boys
were
obviously
drugged
and
nurse
greenleigh
treated
every
one
of
them
she
must
have
known
if
steroids
are
that
dangerous
why
would
they
do
that
to
themselves
they
needed
to
win
and
winning
equals
trophies
which
equals
prestige
for
the
school
you
see
how
they're
treated
it's
been
like
that
forever
sure
the
discus
throwers
got
the
best
seats
at
all
the
crucifixions
meanwhile
i'm
breaking
my
nails
every
day
battling
the
forces
of
evil
and
my
french
teacher
can't
even
remember
my
name
so
what's
the
drill
get
nurse
greenleigh
willow
stands
up
willow
sternly
let's
throw
the
book
at
her
she
probably
went
home
for
the
day
i
think
it
can
wait
xander
why
don't
you
see
if
you
can
find
out
what
these
boys
are
taking
or
at
least
how
they're
taking
it
powders
pills
syringe
i'm
lookin'around
guy
what
about
you
giles
loaded
up
the
tranquilizer
gun
we're
going
fishing
cut
to
the
sewers
it's
dark
and
very
wet
buffy
comes
around
a
corner
with
a
flashlight
scanning
as
she
goes
behind
her
giles
follows
with
his
dart
gun
held
ready
they
hear
a
noise
ahead
of
them
and
giles
raises
the
gun
to
take
aim
buffy
shines
the
flashlight
and
they
see
it
was
only
a
rat
she
puts
her
hand
on
his
arm
to
stop
him
and
he
lowers
the
rifle
they
continue
on
and
come
to
an
intersection
in
the
tunnels
buffy
shines
her
light
down
one
of
them
and
gestures
to
giles
that
they
should
go
that
way
she
takes
another
quick
look
in
the
other
directions
and
begins
down
the
adjacent
tunnel
giles
looks
around
again
also
and
then
follows
buffy
they
both
walk
down
past
the
camera
then
it
focuses
on
the
tunnel
opposite
the
direction
they
came
and
one
of
the
creatures
pokes
its
head
around
the
corner
to
watch
them
as
they
go
around
a
corner
further
down
the
tunnel
cut
to
the
boys'
steam
room
the
entire
swim
team
is
relaxing
in
the
fog

sean
inhales
deeply
and
exhales
aromatherapy
it's
in
the
steam
xander
gives
him
a
stunned
look
cut
to
the
pool
the
nurse
follows
the
coach
at
a
brisk
pace
this
has
got
to
stop
carl
those
poor
children
what
are

a
quitter

room
for
quitters
on
this
team
do

happening
listen
to
yourself
i'm
very
close
to
perfecting
this
we
just
need
to
adjust
the
mix
they
head
down
some
stairs
to
the
pool
equipment
room
below
carl
you
can't
be
thinking
of
continuing
to
expose
these
boys
they're
gonna
be
the
best
i
don't
accept
anything
less
they're
gonna
be
monsters
carl
please
don't
make
it
any
worse
you've
already
lost
three
the
coach
stops
and
looks
at
the
nurse
lost
why
they're
not
lost
he
grabs
her
by
the
arms
pulls
her
around
and
shoves
her
down
into
a
hole
to
a
pool
of
water
in
the
sewers
below
she
screams
as
she
falls
the
water
is
not
deep
and
she
quickly
gets
to
her
feet
wipes
the
water
from
her
eyes
and
looks
up
at
him
through
the
hole
carl
what
are
you
doing
i'm
just
lookin'
after
my
boys
they
may
be
out
of
the
game
right

but
they're
still
a
team
and
a
team's
gotta
eat
he
lifts
the
grating
back
into
place
carl
you
quitter
he
stands
there
to
watch
nurse
greenleigh
looks
around
and
begins
to
panic
suddenly
she
screams
and
gets
pulled
under
the
water

the
library
xander
paces
giles
gets
up
from
cleaning
his
glasses
and
heads
for
the
table
where
willow
and
buffy
are
sitting
cordelia
is
on
the
stairs
to
the
mezzanine
level
behind
the
table
they're
absorbing
the
steroid
mixture
through
the
steam
xander
follows
him
not
they
we
me
we
have
to
find
an
antidote
don't
you
think
the
clock
is
ticking
people
i
wouldn't
break
out
the
tartar
sauce
just
yet
i
mean
it's
not
like
you
were
exposed
more
than
once
buffy
gets
a
worried
look
from
xander
twice
three
times
a
fish
guy
xander
crosses
his
arms
oh
whoa
what
am
i
gonna
do
you
you
you
what
about
me
it's
one
thing
to
be
dating
the
lame
unpopular
guy
but
it's
another
to
be
dating
the
creature
from
the
blue
lagoon
xander
paces
over
to
her
black
lagoon
the
creature
from
the
blue
lagoon
was
brooke
shields
and
thank
you
so
much
for
your
support
xander
sits
by
her
buffy
quietly
to
giles
and
willow
i
think
we'd
better
find
the
rest
of
the
swim
team
and
lock
them
up
before
they
get
in
touch
with
their
inner
halibut
yes
yes
good
uh
we
also
need
to
know
exactly
what's
in
this
this
steroid
gas
so
that
the
hospital's
toxicology
lab
can
develop
an
antidote
willow
stands
up
well
i'll
talk
to
nurse
greenleigh
you're
really
getting
into
this
interrogation
thing
the
trick
is
not
to
leave
any
marks
willow
leaves
buffy
gets
up
on
that
note
i
think
i'm
gonna
go
have
a
little
talk
with
our
coach
somehow
i
doubt
all
he's
been
giving
these
boys
is
inspiration
buffy
leaves
cut
to
the
pool
equipment
room
the
coach
leads
buffy
to
the
same
hole
through
which
he
shoved
nurse
greenleigh
you
got
some
imagination
missy
oh
well
right
now
i'm
imagining
you
in
jail
you're
wearing
a
big
orange
suit
and
oh
look
the
guards
are
beating
you
up
you
don't
have
any
proof
buffy
stops
following
buffy
sternly
tell
me
what's
in
the
steam
coach
marin
faces
her
after
the
fall
of
the
soviet
union
documents
came
into
light
detailing
experiments
with
fish
dna
on
their
olympic
swimmers
tarpon
mako
shark
but
they
couldn't
crack
it
and
you
did
sort
of
why
what
kind
of
question
is
that
for
the
win
to
make
my
team
the
best
they
could
be
do
you
understand
we
have
a
shot
at
the
state
championship
do
you
understand
that
i
don't
care
it's
over
there's
not
gonna
be
any
swim
team
boy
when
they
were
handin'
out
school
spirit
you
didn't
even
stand
in
line
did
you
no
i
was
in
the
line
for
shred
of
sanity
the
coach
reaches
into
the
desk
behind
him
and
pulls
out
a
beretta
9mm
semiautomatic
pistol
he
pulls
back
the
hammer
and
points
the
gun
at
buffy
which
you
obviously
skipped
get
in
the
hole
coach
marin
indicates
with
the
gun
buffy
looks
down
at
the
hole
and
back
up
at
the
coach
in
now
she
sits
down
on
the
edge
with
her
legs
dangling
in
and
looks
up
at
him
this
isn't
over
in
she
gives
him
one
last
look
and
drops
herself
into
the
water
below
it's
about
a
fifteenfoot
drop
so
she
submerges
completely
and
comes
back
up
soaked
through
and
wiping
the
water
from
her
eyes
she
looks
up
at
the
coach
leaning
over
the
hole
you
think
i
don't
care
about
my
boys
but
i
do
they
count
on
me
buffy
understands
now
and
looks
around
for
the
monsters
when
she
turns
back
around
she
screams
at
the
sight
of
what's
left
of
nurse
greenleigh's
body
as
it
floats
by
she
looks
back
up
at
the
coach
so
what
you're
just
gonna
feed
me
to
'em
oh
they've
already
had
their
dinner
but
boys
have
other
needs
cut
to
the
pool
xander
and
cordelia
come
walking
in
looking
for
other
members
of
the
swim
team
xander
is
rubbing
his
neck
expecting
to
find
gills
growing
there
no
one
willow
and
giles
must've
rounded
up
the
rest
of
the
swim
team
does
my
neck
look
scaly
to
you
well
of
course
it
looks
scaly
the
way
you've
been
rubbing
it
dry
like
an
idiot
i
need
to
look
in
a
mirror
wait
here
but
feel
free
to
come
in
if
you
hear
me
scream
he
runs
off
into
the
locker
room
cordelia
keeps
walking
around
the
pool
she
hears
a
door
close
and
glances
behind
her
but
sees
no
one
she
continues
along
the
side
of
the
pool
she
hears
a
door
open
and
assumes
it's
xander
any
gills
yet
behind
her
a
creature
comes
in
and
jumps
into
the
pool
she
looks
into
the
pool
but
at
first
can't
make
out
the
monster
because
of
the
splash
on

spins
around
quickly
startled
and
draws
a
frightened
breath
xander
points
into
the
pool
that's

they

look
at
the
creature
it
suddenly
makes
a
lunge
for
them
from
the
water
and
cordelia
screams
xander
pulls
her
up
and
away

sean
he
was
in
the
pool
skinlessdipping
where's
buffy
she
hasn't
come
back
yet
cut
to
the
sewers
the
camera
pans
around
the
pool
of
water
one
of
the
monsters
pokes
its
head
out
of
the
water
behind
a
pillar
and
observes
buffy
the
camera
continues
until
it
stops
on
her
great
this
is
just
what
my
reputation
needs
that
i
did
it
with
the
entire
swim
team
another
one
of
the
creatures
pokes
its
head
up
to
look
at
buffy
she
makes
a
tentative
jump
to
see
about
getting
out
of
there
she
hears
them
growl
and
looks
around
the
one
by
the
pillar
submerges
again
and
begins
to
swim
buffy
looks
into
the
water
to
try
to
see
where
they
are
cut
underwater
one
of
them
swims
right
past
her
legs
she
sees
its
head
emerge
further
away
from
her
and
draws
a
frightened
breath
cut
to
the
pool
equipment
room
xander
walks
in
and
spots
the
coach
leaning
over
the
hole
and
gloating
what's
up
coach
coach
marin
looks
back
startled
oh
harris
uh
coach
marin
stands
up
how
you
feelin'
little
dry
nothing
a
lemon
butter
sauce
won't
cure
they
both
chuckle
nervously
where's
buffy
the
coach's
eyes
focus
on
his
gun
laying
on
a
barrel
just
behind
xander
cut
to
below
buffy
keeps
looking
for
the
sea
monsters
one
suddenly
rises
up
behind
her
and
lunges
at
her
she
quickly
grabs
it
and
throws
it
aside
another
one
comes
for
her
and
she
deflects
it
into
the
wall
but
loses
her
balance
and
falls
underwater
one
grabs
her
leg
and
she
kicks
out
she
grabs
it
and
throws
it
off
of
her
standing
again
she
grabs
another
one's
arm
as
it
attacks
her
and
flips
it
over
into
the
wall
cut
above
coach
marin
makes
a
grab
for
his
gun
but
xander
grabs
his
arm
pounds
it
into
the
barrel
and
makes
him
drop
it
he
elbows
the
coach
in
the
face
who
falls
over
unconscious
cut
below
buffy
knocks
and
flips
the
monsters
away
as
they
each
come
for
her
in
turn
soon
they've
had
enough
and
the
three
of
them
surround
her
and
slowly
close
in
cut
above
xander
steps
over
to
the
hole
and
looks
down
when
he
sees
what's
going
on
below
he
quickly
lies
down
and
reaches
into
the
hole
with
his
arm
buffy
hurry
your
hand
buffy
looks
up
and
sees
him
there
she
takes
a
breath
crouches
down
into
the
water
and
leaps
up
the
ten
feet
to
grab
xander's
hand
hold
on
he
starts
to
pull
for
all
he's
worth
below
the
creatures
paw
at
buffy's
legs
trying
to
pull
her
back
down
two
of
them
grab
hold
and
she
kicks
and
flails
to
shake
them
off
the
monsters
can't
keep
hold
of
her
and
fall
into
the
water
pull
hold
on
he
pulls
again
but
he's
not
as
strong
as
he
thinks
and
it
goes
slowly
one
of
the
monsters
leaps
up
and
grabs
buffy's
leg
again
she
kicks
it
with
her
free
leg
and
it
goes
tumbling
down
xander
pulls
again
as
buffy
raises
her
legs
up
out
of
the
creature's
reach
slowly
she
emerges
from
the
hole
and
climbs
onto
the
floor
coughing
and
panting
thanks
just
doin'
my
part
for
our
team
behind
him
the
coach
has
regained
consciousness
and
hits
xander
across
the
back
with
a
large
pipe
wrench
oh
he
starts
to
take
a
swing
at
buffy
with
it
too
but
she
ducks
away
and
trips
him
with
her
leg
he
falls
and
screams
as
he
rolls
into
the
hole
buffy
reacts
fast
and
grabs
his
ankle
don't
let
go
don't
let
go
of
me
hold
me
buffy
can't
maintain
her
grip
and
he
falls
into
the
water
below

coach
stands
up
in
the
water
shaking
it
out
of
his
face
and
coughing
buffy
reaches
down
grab
my
hand
he's
too
busy

worried
about

sea
monsters
surrounding
him
to

what
buffy
is
saying

amused
look
