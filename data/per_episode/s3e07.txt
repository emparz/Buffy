the
bronze
people
are
coming
and
going
cut
inside

especially
crowded
tonight
dingoes
ate
my
baby
four
star
mary
are
on
stage
finishing
the
last
song
of
their
set
run
if
i
could
walk
out
oz
looks
out
into
the
crowd
a
smile
for
willow
on
his
face
she
is
sitting
at
a
table
with
xander
and
cordelia
they
have
to
share
it
with
some
other
people
it's
so
crowded
you
know
i'd
never
lie
the
song
ends
with
oz's
last
chord
understated
and
fading
the
crowd
begins
to
applaud
and
cheer
as
devon
takes
his
bows
oz
lifts
his
guitar
from
his
shoulder
leans
the
instrument
against
the
back
wall
of
the
stage
and
heads
down
the
stairs
at
the
side
of
the
stage
to
join
the
gang
at
their
table
willow
smiles
oz
hey
have
a
seat
except
we
don't
have
any
seats
it's
okay
i'll
just
scrunch
in
willow
nudges
over
a
bit
with
her
stool
to
make
room
for
oz
at
the
table
and
bumps
into
xander
she
gives
him
a
nervous
look
xander
hurriedly
scoots
over
a
bit
as
well
nudging
up
hard
against
cordelia
xander
why
are
you
giving
me
a
lap
dance
xander
smiles
weakly
and
strokes
her
arm
what
i
just
like
you
cordelia
pulls
her
arm
away
from
him
and
squirms
around
a
bit
to
get
comfortable
again
willow
stammers
smiling
nervously
and
that's
very
beautiful
i
think
it's
great
when
two
people
like
two
people
and
want
to
be
close
to
them
instead
of
anyone
else
oz
smiles
to
himself
enjoying
it
as
always
whenever
willow
does
that
cute
stammering
thing
xander
also
nervous
here
here
yeah
well
put
oz
points
at
a
cup
hey
can
i
snag
a
sip
sure
willow
reaches
for
her
cup
xander
reaches
also
yeah
you
got
it
their
hands
touch
as
they
both
reach
for
her
cup
they
look
at
each
other
in
surprise
and
instantly
jerk
back
their
arms
in
doing
so
they
knock
a
tray
of
drinks
out
of
the
hand
of
the
waitress
standing
behind
them
xander
slips
off
of
his
stool
and
tries
to
catch
them
but
of
course
he's
too
late
and
can
only
look
down
at
the
spilled
drinks
around
him
the
crowd
begins
to
applaud
his
graceful
maneuver
he
goes
with
the
situation
and
raises
his
hands
to
the
crowd
in
acknowledgment
willow
however
is
embarrassed
thank
you
xander
turns
around
thank
you
xander
waves
uh
we're
here
through
saturday
enjoy
the
veal
xander
smiles
willow
is
terribly
embarrassed
now
and
tries
to
hide
her
face
xander
gets
back
on
his
stool
oz
reaches
for
a
cup
on
his
own
why
are
you
guys
so
hyper
oz
takes
a
drink
from
willow's
cup
willow
nervously
tries
to
cover
hey
speaking
of
people
and
things
they
do
that
aren't
like
usual
anyone
notice
buffy
acting
sort
of
different
oz
grimaces
at
the
drink
and
puts
the
cup
back
on
the
table
let's
see
uh
killing
zombies
uh
torching
sewer
monsters
and
no
that's
pretty
much
the
uh
xander
grins
weakly
same
old
buffster
willow
concerned
well
i
just
mean
you
know
she's
off
by
herself
a
lot
more
and
she's
kind
of
distracted
cordelia
smiles
think
maybe
she
has
a
new
honey
a
boyfriend
why
wouldn't
she
tell
us
excuse
me
when
your
last
steady
killed
half
the
class
and
then
your
rebound
guy
sends
you
a
dumpogram
it
makes
a
girl
shy
but
we're
the
best
of
buffy's
bestest
buds
she'd
tell
us
buffy
arrives
behind
them
tell
you
what
about
your
new
boyfriend
who
we
made
up
unless
we
didn't
willow
gives
her
an
inquiring
look
buffy
raises
her
eyebrows
this
was
a
topic
of
discussion
well
raised
but
never
discussed
so
are
you
dating
somebody
or
not
buffy
angles
her
eyes
up
and
sways
around
a
bit
considering
what
she
should
say
i
wouldn't
use
the
word
'dating'
buffy
looks
at
them
but
i
am
going
out
with
somebody
tonight
as
a
matter
of
fact
really
who
faith
puts
her
hand
on
xander's
shoulder
and
pulls
him
aside
a
little
so
she
can
squeeze
in
yo
what's
up
faith
nudges
buffy's
shoulder
hey
time
to
motorvate
buffy
puts
her
arm
around
faith
really
we're
just
good
friends
the
two
slayers
head
out
of
the
club
together
cut
to
a
cemetery
buffy
and
faith
both
roll
onto
their
backs
side
by
side
each
with
a
vampire
on
top
of
them
buffy
backhand
punches
her
attacker
while
faith
struggles
to
get
control
over
hers
buffy's
vampire
tries
to
punch
her
but
she
redirects
his
arm
to
hit
the
ground
next
to
her
giles
watches
calmly
while
sitting
behind
them
on
a
nearby
bench
buffy
is
still
on
her
back
while
her
assailant
is
now
standing
over
her
throwing
punches
down
at
her
faith
log
rolls
away
from
them
taking
her
attacker
with
her
giles
takes
off
his
glasses
and
begins
to
clean
them
faith
manages
to
roll
on
top
of
her
vampire
she
yanks
him
by
the
lapels
of
his
jacket
to
a
standing
position
spins
halfway
around
and
throws
him
into
a
log
roll
over
a
stone
bench
he
hits
the
ground
and
keeps
on
rolling
buffy
is
up
now
and
ducks
a
halfspinning
jumping
hook
kick
from
her
vampire
and
then
sidesteps
to
avoid
a
punch
faith
jumps
up
onto
the
bench
and
then
back
down
to
the
ground
her
attacker
aims
a
punch
at
her
face
but
rethinks
his
maneuver
and
decides
to
snap
kick
her
in
the
gut
thinking
quickly
faith
grabs
his
foot
and
throws
it
over
his
head
forcing
him
to
flip
over
in
a
back
layout
he
lands
hard
on
his
stomach
buffy
throws
a
punch
at
her
assailant's
face
but
he
ducks
it
she
tries
for
another
one
but
he
blocks
it
she
then
aims
for
his
stomach
with
another
punch
but
is
blocked
yet
again
the
vampire
tries
to
punch
her
but
she
latches
onto
his
arm
and
yanks
him
backwards
then
forwards
and
twists
his
arm
sending
him
flipping
onto
his
back
giles
calmly
watches
and
takes
notes
faith
has
a
firm
grip
on
her
attacker
and
throws
his
head
backward
sending
him
flying
backwards
onto
a
bench
his
momentum
carries
him
sliding
over
it
faith
jumps
up
onto
the
bench
following
him
over
ready
to
attack
buffy
sends
her
vampire
spinning
back
to
the
ground
with
a
twokick
combination
of
a
roundhouse
followed
by
a
hook
kick
she
pauses
for
a
moment
to
let
him
get
back
up
and
then
roundhouse
kicks
him
in
the
gut
followed
immediately
by
a
punch
to
his
face
as
the
momentum
of
her
kick
carries
her
around
giles
picks
up
his
cup
of
coffee
and
continues
his
calm
vigilance
faith
jumps
down
from
the
bench
and
roundhouse
kicks
her
vampire
in
the
face
buffy
roundhouse
kicks
hers
again
in
the
stomach
faith
punches
her
vampire
in
the
stomach
and
takes
aim
with
her
stake
buffy
shoves
hers
against
faith's
and
they
end
up
back
to
back
the
slayers
both
plunge
their
stakes
into
their
respective
demons
simultaneously
causing
them
both
to
explode
into
ashes
after
the
dust
settles
they
give
each
other
a
highfive
and
head
over
to
giles
synchronized

giles
lowers
his
coffee
cup
but
keeps
it
held
at

sloppy
they
all
turn
to
look
at
the
woman
who's
just
walked
into
view
her
hair
is
pulled
up
in
a
severe
hair
style
and
she
has
a
very
serious
look
on
her
face

leaning
against
the
stair
railing
cleaning
his
glasses
buffy
is
sitting
near
the
middle
of
the
large
central
table
there
are
several
books
lying
open
on
it
faith
is
standing
by
a
corner
of
the
table
addressing
mrs
post
who
is
looking
through
some
of
giles'
collection

new
watcher

this
problem
with
authority
figures
they
end
up
kind
of
dead
she
nods
sarcastically
and
takes
a
seat
next
to
buffy
gwendolyn
walking
past
the
table
duly
noted
and
fortunately
it's
not
up
to
you
buffy
and
faith
exchange
a
look
gwendolyn
walks
around
the
table
below
the
railing
of
the
upper
level
looking
around
at
the
few
stacks
there
are
in
the
study
area
of
the
library
apparently
unaware
that
the
main
stacks
are
up
the
stairs
and
through
a
set
of
french
doors
well
out
of
view
mr
giles
where
do
you
keep
the
rest
of
your
books
ii'm
sorry

on
his
glasses

rest

actual
library
giles
gives
her
a
confused
look
oh
gwendolyn
smiles
thinly
i

can
assure
you
mrs

is
the
finest
occult
reference
collection
gwendolyn
interrupts
this
side
of
the
atlantic
i'm
sure
do
you
have
hume's
paranormal
encyclopedia
giles
looks
away
knowing
that
while
his
collection
is
superior
it
is
still
not
complete
the
labyrinth
maps
of
malta
buffy
gives
him
a
hopeful
look
it's
on
order
well
i
suppose
that
you
have
sir
robert
kane's
twilight
compendium
oh
uh
giles
looks
around

book
yes
giles

it
out

do
giles
holds
it
up
gwendolyn
unimpressed
of
course
you
do
gwendolyn
paces
past
him
i
have
been
sent
by
the
council
for
a
very
important
reason
faith
needs
a
watcher
i
am
to
act
in
that
capacity
and
report
back
faith
leans
forward
in
her
chair
excuse
me
mary
poppins
you
don't
seem
to
be
listening
giles
interrupts
faith
if
the
council
feels
that
you
need
closer
observation
then
we
will
all
of
course
cooperate
faith
leans
back
again
not
at
all
happy
with
the
situation
the
council
wishes
me
to
report
on
the
entire
situation
here
gwendolyn
to
giles
including
you
that
takes
giles
by
surprise
mm
academic
probation's
not
so
funny
today
huh
giles
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
innocently
giles
glares
at
her
she
just
gives
it
right
back
to
him
the
fact
is
there
is
talk
in
the
council
that
you
have
become
a
bit
too
gwendolyn
inhales
american
giles
taken
aback
me
buffy
surprised
him
a
demon
named
lagos
is
coming
here
to
the
hellmouth
gwendolyn
condescendingly
mr
giles
an
illustration
of
lagos
if
you
please
giles
a
bit
flustered
oh
uh
giles
looks
at
the
books
on
the
table
yes
uh
he
sits
at
the
table
and
begins
to
look
through
one
of
the
books
perhaps
later
giles
stops
looking
very
taken
aback
he
begins
to
seethe
lagos
seeks
the
glove
of
myhnegon
no
record
of
this
glove's
full
power
exists
but
we
do
know
it
is
highly
dangerous
and
must
not
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
demon
lagos
must
be
stopped
giles
folds
his
hands
over
his
books
and
looks
up
at
her
what
do
you
propose
well
if
it's
not
too
radical
a
suggestion
i
thought
we
might
kill
him
giles
turns
his
head
away
from
her
and
takes
off
his
glasses
i
suggest
two
slayers
at
full
strength
for
a
coordinated
hunt
buffy
gives
faith
a
look
faith
just
gives
gwendolyn
an
even
stare
we
believe
the
glove
to
be
buried
in
a
tomb
somewhere
so
lagos
will
be
headed
for
the
cemetery
there
is
more
than
one
in
sunnydale
i
see
how
many
uh
twelve
within
the
city
limits
gwendolyn
takes
a
deep
breath
well
we'll
just
have
to
take
them
one
at
a
time
giles
puts
his
glasses
back
on
and
starts
to
look
through
his
books
again
anything
in
your
books
that
might
pinpoint
the
exact
location
of
the
tomb
would
be
useful
but
then
we
cannot
ask
for
miracles
giles
lets
his
book
drop
to
the
table
and
makes
a
point
of
looking
directly
away
from
her
rubbing
his
fingers
keeping
his
cool
we
will
begin
tomorrow
at
sunset
faith
gwendolyn
faith
almost
startles
with
me
please
she
gives
faith
a
thin
smile
and
walks
from
the
library
faith
gives
buffy
a
glance
then
follows
her
out
giles
visibly
relaxes
when
they've
gone
that
was
bracing
he
slaps
his
glasses
onto
the
table
and
leans
his
lips
into
his
fist
interesting
lady
can
we
kill
her
giles
lowers
his
fist
i
think
the
council
might
frown
upon
that
his
expression
indicates
he's
considering
it
anyway
but
soon
discards
the
notion
well
giles
stands
up
how
do
you
feel
about
a
spot
of
training
cut
to
angel's
mansion
he
and
buffy
are
practicing
t'ai
chi
in
front
of
the
great
fireplace
angel
concentrates
on
the
exercises
but
buffy
watches
his
moves
and
does
her
best
to
mirror
them
they
each
begin
with
their
arms
stretched
high
above
and
ahead
of
them
hands
together
they
lower
their
arms
to
waist
level
with
a
graceful
bend
at
the
elbows
buffy
glances
over
at
angel
watching
his
elegant
movements
she
turns
her
attention
back
to
the
exercise
and
crosses
her
right
wrist
over
her
left
they
both
sweep
their
crossed
arms
in
a
wide
arc
from
left
to
right
and
then
draw
their
hands
in
to
their
waists
and
make
a
quarter
turn
to
their
left
so
that
buffy
has
her
back
to
angel
they
both
extend
their
arms
and
slowly
raise
them
never
stopping
their
fluid
movements
until
their
hands
are
again
held
high
angel
takes
the
two
steps
over
to
buffy
and
puts
his
hands
over
hers
buffy
looks
up
at
his
hands
on
hers
as
he
pulls
her
arms
down
and
around
her
she
slowly
turns
to
face
him
and
angles
her
face
up
toward
him
their
lips
almost
meet
when
buffy
suddenly
pulls
away
and
walks
over
to
one
of
the
two
couches
set
at
right
angles
to
each
other
to
get
her
things
uhh
i
gotta
go
big
night
for
us
slayer
types
angel
turns
away
a
confused
expression
on
his
face
buffy
pulls
on
her
backpack
people
to
see
demons
to
kill
buffy
starts
to
leave
better
hurry
before
somebody
figures
out
what
we're
doing
angel
pulls
on
his
shirt
what
are
we
doing
buffy
stops
training
buffy
quietly
and
almost
kissing
angel
looks
at
her
and
steps
toward
her
as
he
buttons
his
shirt
buffy
turns
to
face
him
sorry
it's
just
buffy
smiles
weakly
old
habit
buffy
loses
the
smile
bad
bad
habit
to
be
broken
it's
hard
it's
not
hard
buffy
with
resolve
cold
turkey
that's
the
key
to
quitting
they
both
look
at
each
other
for
a
long
moment
knowing
it's
just
not
that
easy
buffy
weakly
and
desperately
you
think
they
make
a
patch
for
this
you
have
to
go
i
really
do
angel
looks
away
as
buffy
turns
again
to
go
she
only
gets
a
couple
of
steps
when
she
sighs
and
turns
to
face
angel
again
i'm
gonna
try
and
vent
a
little
hormonal
angst
by
going
out
there
and
killing
a
lagos
whatever
that
is
angel
faces
her
again
upon
hearing
that
demon's
name
lagos
some
demon
looking
for
some
allpowerful
thingamabob
buffy
angel
sits
suddenly
worried
and
i
gotta
stop
him
before
he
unleashes
unholy
havoc
buffy
sees
his
worried
look
and
it's
another
tuesday
night
in
sunnydale
angel
can't
bring
himself
to
look
at
her
again
and
so
just
stares
off
into
space
be
careful
buffy
turns
and
heads
out
of
the
mansion
angel
watches
her
back
as
she
goes
and
when
she's
gone
he
gets
up
to
start
some
work
of
his
own
cut
to
the
library
giles
is
sitting
at
the
large
table
reading
through
a
book
with
a
dozen
other
volumes
open
and
spread
out
in
front
of
him
willow
is
standing
behind
the
railing
of
the
stack
level
behind
him
xander
is
standing
at
the
end
of
the
table
giles
looks
up
from
his
book
oh
this
is
intolerable
giles
slams
the
book
shut
there's
not
a
word
here
about
lagos
or
the
glove
giles
stands
up
we
don't
have
time
for
this
giles
drops
the
book
in
frustration
nearmissing
giles
turns
to
willow
and
xander
just
find
out
all
you
can
about
the
demon
itsitsits
strengths
itsits
weaknesses
giles
begins
to
pace
its
places
of
origin
giles
stops
and
yanks
off
his
glasses
and
most
importantly
giles
points
at
xander
with
his
glasses
what
it
plans
to
do
with
this
blasted
glove
xander
gives
giles
an
annoyed
smile
hey
you're
not
the
watcher
of
me
then
go
home
but
if
you
choose
to
stay
then
work
he
makes
frustrated
tracks
into
his
office
xander
stares
after
him
for
a
moment
then
starts
up
the
stairs
to
the
stack
level
for
more
research
willow
steps
over
to
meet
him
ugh
it's
late
i'm
tired
what
does
he
want
from
us
anyway
they
head
into
the
stacks
the
number
of
a
qualified
surgeon
to
remove
the
british
flag
from
his
butt
they
stop
at
a
spot
where
a
few
books
are
lying
open
on
the
floor
and
sit
down
xander
takes
one
of
them
and
starts
to
look
through
it
my
eyes
are
all
blurry
she
leans
forward
and
rests
her
head
in
her
hands
for
a
moment
then
starts
rubbing
her
temples
with
her
fingers
ohh
she
moans
as
she
rubs
xander
looks
over
at
her
concerned
he
sets
down
his
book
nudges
a
bit
closer
and
reaches
over
to
do
the
rubbing
for
her
when
she
feels
his
fingers
at
her
temples
willow
drops
her
own
hands
into
her
lap
and
lets
him
minister
to
her
letting
out
a
few
more
moans
oh
stop
right
xander
continues
rubbing
stop
means
no
xander
keeps
rubbing
and
no
means
no
so
um
xander
finally
stops
stop
he
leans
back
away
from
her
she
sits
up
a
bit
he
takes
his
book
again
to
continue
his
research
suddenly
willow
reaches
for
him
grabs
his
face
and
plants
a
hard
kiss
on
his
lips
xander
responds
and
puts
his
hands
around
her
to
pull
her
closer
they
kiss
passionately
for
a
few
seconds
when
giles
suddenly
comes
walking
by
his
attention
focused
on
a
book
in
his
hands
as
he
reads
willow
and
xander
don't
notice
him
at
all
willow
xander
they
stop
kissing
and
quickly
scramble
to
their
feet
you
can
stop
your
uh
studying
they
wipe
and
cover
their
mouths
in
guilt
but
aren't
yet
sure
if
they've
been
caught
since
giles
is
looking
at
a
bookcase
willow
bites
her
nails
nervously
i've
got
what
i
need
xander
trying
to
be
cool
what
have
you
got
uh
the
probable
location
of
the
glove
of
myhnegon
giles
faces
them

uh
housed
in
the
von
hauptman
family
crypt
yeah

over
at
the
restfield
cemetery

continues
his
reading
where's
buffy
at
uh

crypt
xander
starts
out

stops
by
xander

willow
nervously
aand
i'll
just
keep
studying
i
think

on
the
verge
of
a
big
lagos
breakthrough
giles
looks
up
from
his
book
no
i'd
say
we're
done
he
starts
back
out
of
the
stacks
willow
lets
out
a
deep
sigh
ridden
with
guilt
and
halfway
convinced
that
they've
been
caught
cut
to
the
streets
at
night
faith
and
buffy
walk
along
as
people
and
cars
go
by
ronnie
deadbeat
steve
klepto
kenny
drummer
eventually
i
just
had
to
face
up
to
my
destiny
as
a
loser
magnet
now
it's
strictly
get
some
get
gone
you
can't
trust
guys
you
can
trust
some
guys
buffy
gets
a
doubtful
look
from
faith
really
i've
read
about
them
faith
laughs
yeah
so
what
about
you
you
mean
like
me
and
guys
me
mmhm
not
much
to
tell
these
days
yeah
but
you
gotta
have
stories

mean
i've
had
my
share
of
losers
but
you
you
boinked
the
undead
what
was
that
like
life
with
angel's
was
complicated
it's
still
a
little
hard
for
me
to
talk
about
well
try
they
stop
walking
look
faith
all
the
angel
issues
are
still
kind
of
with
me
so
if
you
don't
mind
i'd
rather
not
faith
shrugs
yeah
faith
shrugs
yeah
whatever
buffy
looks
away
you
know
what
we're
oh
for
six
tonight
why
don't
we
just
blow
this
off
yeah
i
am
kinda
beat
butbut
shady
hill's
pretty
close
i'll
swing
through
it

on
my
way
anyway

miss
priss
on
my
back
now
i
don't
need
another
baby
sitter
i'll
holler
if
i'm
having
any
fun
buffy
smiles
thinly
okay
faith
nods
down
the
street
later
faith
goes
thanks
she
watches
her
go
for
a
moment
before
turning
and
heading
home
cut
to
shady
hill
cemetery
faith
walks
around
a
hedge
and
into
view
scanning
the
graveyard
as
she
goes
suddenly
the
lid
of
a
stone
coffin
slams
into
the
ground
in
front
of
her
she
jerks
back
startled
but
unhurt
in
front
of
her
she
sees
lagos
a
warrior
demon
grabbing
things
out
of
the
coffin
and
throwing
them
aside
as
he
quickly
rummages
through
it
faith
to
herself
son
of
a
bitch
it's
my
lucky
day
she
starts
to
run
toward
him
and
jumps
into
a
flying
side
kick
to
lagos'
back
he
hardly
budges
and
turns
his
head
to
see
who
is
disturbing
him
faith
grabs
his
arm
and
whips
him
around
to
face
her
she
backhand
punches
him
in
the
face
and
instantly
follows
up
with
another
swing
to
his
face
then
punches
him
in
the
gut
and
again
in
the
face
she
pushes
him
away
slightly
to
get
some
distance
between
them
and
then
roundhouse
kicks
him
in
the
side
unfazed
and
tired
of
the
interruption
lagos
grabs
her
by
the
neck
and
throws
her
high
and
far
she
slams
into
the
side
of
a
mausoleum
and
falls
to
the
ground
lagos
turns
his
attention
back
to
the
open
coffin
faith
scrambles
to
her
feet
and
starts
to
run
at
him
again
lagos
hears
her
coming
this
time
and
turns
to
face
her
she
tries
to
grab
his
neck
but
he
blocks
her
arm
and
does
an
uppercut
to
faith's
diaphragm
which
makes
her
airborne
once
again
she
hits
the
ground
hard
and
starts
to
struggle
for
breath
lagos
ignores
her
and
goes
back
to
his
rummaging
he
pulls
the
last
of
the
coffin's
contents
out
sees
that
it's
nothing
he
wants
and
throws
it
aside
in
disgust
he
wastes
no
time
getting
out
of
there
stomping
right
past
faith
not
giving
her
even
so
much
as
another
glance
with
her
breath
knocked
out
of
her
faith
is
unable
to
get
up
to
pursue
him
cut
to
restfield
cemetery
xander
finds
his
way
through
the
gravestones
to
the
von
hauptman
family
crypt
his
breathing
is
heavy
and
nervous
he
finds
the
crypt
and
peeks
at
it
from
behind
a
bush
making
sure
no
one
and
nothing
else
is
around
he
steps
out
from
behind
the
bush
nervously
looking
around
while
he
makes
his
way
toward
the
crypt
xander
smiling
dripping
with
sarcasm
hey
giles
here's
a
nifty
idea
why
don't
i
alleviate
my
guilt
by
goin'
out
and
gettin'
myself
really
really
killed
he
stops
in
his
tracks
when
he
thinks
he
hears
a
noise
sure
enough
a
second
later
he
can
hear
the
sound
of
stone
grinding
against
stone
coming
from
inside
the
crypt
he
swiftly
ducks
behind
a
group
of
bushes
crouches
down
and
waits
to
see
who
will
come
out
a
figure
soon
comes
out
of
the
crypt
and
pulls
the
door
closed
in
its
arms
it
holds
something
wrapped
in
a
bunch
of
rags
the
figure
turns
its
back
to
xander
as
it
grabs
the
outer
iron
gate
and
swings
it
closed
as
well
xander
rises
up
just
a
bit
so
he
can
better
see
who
it
is
the
figure
turns
around
again
and
begins
to
cautiously
make
its
way
out
of
the
graveyard
as
it
nears
xander
he
sees
that
it's
angel
xander
doesn't
take
his
eyes
off
of
him
as
he
walks
past
when
angel
is
far
enough
ahead
of
him
xander
comes
out
from
behind
the
bushes
pulls
out
his
stake
and
starts
to
follow
cut
to
the
atrium
at
angel's
mansion
xander
sneaks
down
the
stairs
to
the
main
gallery
and
tiptoes
over
to
a
window
where
he
can
see
inside
there
to
his
shock
he
sees
buffy
with
angel
kissing
passionately
part
2

angel's
mansion
he
and
buffy
are
kissing
passionately
the
camera
circles
around
them
as
they
continue
kissing
suddenly
buffy
breaks
it
off
and
takes
a
couple
of
steps
backward
and
looks
away
from
his
face
oh
god
angel
confused
buffy
what
am
i
doing
buffy
looks
up
at
him
what
are
you
doing
angel
still
confused
i
don't
know
shame
on
you
angel
doesn't
know
how
to
respond
to
that
he
puts
his
hand
to
his
forehead
buffy
heads
over
to
her
things
on
the
couch
oh
god
i
i
don't
even
know
why
i
came
back
here
she
starts
to
pull
on
her
jacket
angel
steps
over
and
takes
it
from
her
hands
it's
good
you
did
buffy
looks
up
to
him
waiting
for
an
explanation
i
think
i
have
what
you're
looking
for
he
leads
her
by
the
hand
over
to
a
pedestal
where
the
thing
he
got
from
the
crypt
lies
still
wrapped
up
in
rags
great
just
wherever
this
was
giftwrapped
remind
me
not
to
shop
there
he
unwraps
the
rags
to
reveal
their
contents
it's
an
ancientlooking
glove
made
of
leather
chain
mail
and
plate
mail
there
are
small
spikes
along
the
plates
that
cover
the
back
of
the
hand
and
the
forearm
ringed
around
the
opening
are
ten
hinged
claws
that
look
something
like
crab
legs
but
made
of
steel
and
very
sharp
glove
of
myhnegon
the
world's
ugliest
fashion
accessory
she
reaches
out
to
touch
it
angel
quickly
stays
her
hand
with
his
no
don't
once
you
put
it
on
the
glove
can
never
be
removed
so
no
touching
buffy
nods
looks
at
their
hands
kinda
like
us
angel
gets
the
hint
and
releases
her
hand
he
wraps
the
glove
back
up
in
the
rags
you
hold
on
to
it
i'll
i'll
tell
giles
in
the
morning
at
least
he'll
be
happy
cut
to
giles'
apartment
he
is
researching
through
a
book
at
his
desk
gwendolyn
walks
in
front
of
the
camera
and
around
to
giles'
side
he
seems
to
have
found
something
ah
yes
there
we
are
in
the
book
is
a
sketch
of
a
battle
scene
with
an
inset
of
the
glove
it
resembles
the
real
thing
only
vaguely
he
sets
the
book
down
for
her
to
see
there's
a
wood
engraving
see
the
glove
of
myhnegon
gwendolyn
looks
at
it
unimpressed
yes
engraved
by
father
theodore
of
wolsham
yes
based
i
believe
on
very
sketchy
and
unreliable
folk
legends
the
pictures
are
fun
to
look
at
mr
giles
but
one
really
ought
to
read
the
nice
words
as
well
giles
looks
up
from
the
books
but
stares
ahead
not
wanting
gwendolyn
to
see
the
look
of
raw
annoyance
in
his
eyes
in
the
kitchen
the
tea
kettle
begins
to
whistle
ah
giles
stands
up
yes
giles
puts
his
hands
in
his
pockets
some
tea
perhaps
he
strides
into
the
kitchen
gwendolyn
takes
the
few
steps
over
to
the
bar
where
he
has
two
cups
already
set
out
for
the
tea
and
sits
on
one
of
the
stools
giles
grabs
the
kettle
from
the
stove
i
know
that
you
must
find
me
tiresome
but
it's
insidious
really
giles
pours
the
hot
water
into
one
of
the
cups
gwendolyn
looks
down
at
the
teabag
in
her
still
empty
cup
takes
it
out
and
sets
it
aside
a
person
slips
up
on
the
little
things
and
soon
everything
has
gone
to
hell
in
a
handbasket
giles
doesn't
say
anything
to
her
rejection
of
his
teabag
she
opens
her
purse
and
pulls
out
a
small
box
with
her
own
supply
of
tea
for
example
buffy
your
slayer
giles
struggling
to
control
his
voice
mrs
post
giles
pours
her
hot
water
i
can
assure
you
that
buffy
is
both
dedicated
and
industrious
and
i
am
in
complete
control
of
my
slayer
suddenly
his
apartment
door
whips
open
and
xander
runs
into
the
room
giles
we
have
a
big
problem
it's
buffy
gwendolyn
give
giles
a
snooty
look
will
you
excuse
us
he
walks
very
stiffly
from
the
kitchen
and
nods
to
xander
to
follow
they
go
to
the
far
side
of
the
room
and
whisper
between
themselves
gwendolyn
takes
her
own
teabag
and
puts
it
in
her
cup
to
steep
would
you
like
some
assistance
giles
and
xander
stop
their
whispering
and
look
at
her
giles
smiling
thinly
thank
you
that
won't
be
necessary
they
go
back
to
their
private
discussion
gwendolyn
looks
at
her
cup
to
see
how
far
along
her
tea
is
cut
to
sunnydale
high
cut
to
the
library
giles
paces
slowly
in
the
main
area
behind
him
the
door
opens
and
he
hears
someone
walk
in
he
slowly
turns
to
see
that
it's
buffy
lagos
is
out
of
luck
i
got
the
magic
mitten
thingy
she
stops
to
see
that
xander
cordelia
oz
and
willow
are
all
sitting
at
the
center
table
looking
as
glum
as
giles
does
what's
with
all
the
tragedy
masks
giles
indicates
a
chair
better
take
a
seat
buffy
xander
gets
up
out
of
his
chair
nudges
it
over
a
bit
so
it's
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
steps
away
to
stand
next
to
cordelia
buffy
slowly
steps
over
to
the
chair
what's
going
on
buffy
sits
we
know
angel
is
alive
giles
buffy
looks
shocked
xander
saw
you
with
him
it
would
appear
that
you've
been
hiding
him
and
that
you
lied
to
us
buffy
looks
away
trying
to
absorb
this
new
turn
of
events
nobody's
here
to
blame
you
buffy
but
this
is
serious
you
need
help
buffy
looks
up
at
willow
it's
not
what
you
think
hope
not
because
i
think
you're
harboring
a
vicious
killer
buffy
can't
believe
xander's
callousness
willow
trying
to
mediate
this
isn't
about
attacking
buffy
remember
'i'
statements
only
'i
feel
angry'
'i
feel
worried'
cordelia
fine
here's
one
i
feel
worried
about
me
last
time
around
angel
barely
laid
a
hand
on
buffy
he
was
way
more
interested
in
killing
her
friends
but
he's
better
now
better
for
how
long
buffy
i
mean
did
you
even
think
about
that
buffy
stands
up
what
is
this
demons
anonymous
buffy
starts
to
leave
i
don't
need
an
intervention
here
oh
don't
you
giles
buffy
stops
and
faces
him
you
must've
known
it
was
wrong
seeing
angel
or
you
wouldn't
have
hidden
it
from
all
of
us
buffy
desperate
and
defensive
i
was
going
to
tell
you
i
was
iit
was
just
that
i
i
didn't
know
why
he
came
back
i
just
wanted
to
wait
for
what
for
angel
to
go
psycho
again
the
next
time
you
give
him
a
happy
buffy
raising
her
voice
defensively
i'm
not
going
to
buffy
raises
her
hand
to
him
we're
not
together
like
that
but
you
were
kissing
him
willow
gives
oz
a
quick
look
then
looks
at
buffy
worried
buffy
thinks
about
the
implication
of
oz's
accusation
and
looks
at
xander
you
were
spying
on
me
buffy
steps
toward
him
what
gives
you
the
right
what
gives
you
the
right
to
suck
face
with
your
demon
lover
again
buffy
defensive
again
it
was
an
accident
what
you
just
tripped
and
fell
on
his
lips
it
was
wrong
okay
i
know
that
and
i
know
that
it
can't
happen
again
but
you
guys
have
to
believe
me
i
would
never
put
you
in
any
danger
if
i
thought
for
a
second
that
angel
was
going
to
hurt
anyone
you
would
stop
him
like
you
did
last
time
with
ms
calendar
buffy
is
completely
taken
aback
by
xander's
totally
insensitive
and
unfair
attack
and
can't
utter
a
word
in
response
willow
senses
that
it's
time
to
intercede
willow
nervously
buffy
i
feel
that
when
it
comes
to
angel
you
can't
see
straight
and
that's
why
we're
we're
all
gonna
help
you
face
this
but
he's
better
now
i
swear
look
you
guys
he's
the
one
that
found
the
glove
of
myhnegon
hhe's
keeping
it
safe
for
us
in
the
mansion
xander
spreads
his
arms
right
great
plan
leave
tons
of
firepower
with
the
scary
guy
and
leave
us
to
clean
up
the
mess
he
makes
tracks
to
leave
the
library
intent
on
doing
something
about
this
buffy
takes
him
by
the
arm
and
spins
him
around
to
face
her
you
would
just
love
an
excuse
to
hurt
him
wouldn't
you
i
don't
need
an
excuse
i
think
lots
of
dead
people
actually
constitutes
a
reason
right
this
is
all
nobility
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
jealousy
xander
gives
her
a
haughty
grin
but
is
interrupted
before
he
can
continue
hello
miss
notoveryourselfyet
buffy
shakes
her
head
in
warning
don't
you
start
with
me
cordelia
looks
to
giles
for
support
willow
upset
giles
no
one's
doing
the
'i'
statements
that's
enough
everybody
now
buffy
knows
our
concerns
and
her
actions
however
illadvised
can
be
understood
giles
cordelia
shakes
her
head
our
priority
right
now
is
to
retrieve
the
glove
of
myhnegon
and
try
to
destroy
it
now
all
of
you
back
to
classes
one
after
the
other
they
all
get
up
gather
their
things
and
go
giles
goes
into
his
office
his
hands
firmly
stuffed
into
his
pockets
once
there
he
takes
off
his
jacket
and
hangs
it
around
the
back
of
his
chair
buffy
follows
him
and
stops
by
the
office
door
buffy
uneasily
thanks
for
the
bail
in
there
giles
doesn't
face
her
and
instead
unbuttons
his
vest
i
know
this
is
a
lot
to
absorb
but
angel
did
find
the
glove
and
that
was
a
good
giles
interrupts
be
quiet
giles
slowly
turns
to
face
her
giles
sternly
i
won't
remind
you
that
the
fate
of
the
world
often
lies
with
the
slayer
what
would
be
the
point
nor
shall
i
remind
you
that
you've
jeopardized
the
lives
of
all
that
you
hold
dear
by
harboring
a
known
murderer
but
sadly
i
must
remind
you
that
angel
tortured
me
for
hours
for
pleasure
you
should
have
told
me
he
was
alive
you
didn't
you
have
no
respect
for
me
or
the
job
i
perform
buffy
averts
her
eyes
in
shame
giles
turns
back
to
his
desk
sits
down
and
leans
back
in
thought
buffy
just
stands
in
the
doorway
for
a
long
moment
before
leaving
quietly
cut
to
faith's
motel
room
there
is
a
knock
at
the
door
faith
opens
it
stake
raised
and
ready
she
is
surprised
to
see
gwendolyn
standing
there
she
lowers
the
stake
as
mrs
post
enters
a
word
of
advice
vampires
rarely
knock
especially
in
daylight
gwendolyn
closes
the
door
oh
right
gwendolyn
looks
around
so
this
is
your
home
yeah
faith
gestures
around
the
room
the
decorator
actually
just
left
faith
do
you
know
who
the
spartans
were
gwendolyn
leans
against
the
dresser
wild
stab
a
bunch
of
guys
from
spart
faith
sits
on
the
bed
they
were
the
fiercest
warriors
known
to
ancient
greece
and
they
lived
in
quarters
very
much
like
these
do
you
know
why
because
a
true
fighter
needs
nothing
else
i'm
going
to
be
very
hard
on
you
faith
i
will
not
brook
insolence
or
laziness
and
i
will
not
allow
blunders
like
last
night's
attack
you
will
probably
hate
me
a
great
deal
of
the
time
faith
smiles
sardonically
you
think
gwendolyn
steps
over
to
the
bed
but
i
will
make
you
a
better
slayer
gwendolyn
sits
next
to
faith
and
that
will
keep
you
alive
you
have
to
trust
that
i
am
right
god
only
knows
what
mr
giles
has
been
filling
your
head
with
giles
is
okay
gwendolyn
stands
his
methods
are
unfathomable
to
me
i
find
him
entirely
confounding
but
that
is
not
important
let
him
have
his
games
and
secret
meetings
what
meetings
oh
i
don't
know
something
with
buffy
and
her
friends
oh
right
i
guess
that
doesn't
include
me
and
why
does
he
let
her
socialize
so
much
it
hardly
seems
no
matter
would
you
like
to
do
some
training
training
faith
stands
up
as
in
kicking
and
punching
and
stabbing
gwendolyn
smiles
yes
that's
the
idea
i'm
your
girl
cut
to
the
halls
at
sunnydale
high
the
bell
rings
buffy
walks
around
the
corner
and
stops
when
she
sees
willow
at
her
locker
she
takes
a
breath
to
calm
herself
and
heads
over
to
her
friend
hey
hey
willow
continues
gathering
her
stuff
so
on
a
scale
of
one
to
a
million
how
much
are
you
hating
me
right
now
willow
jumpy
trying
to
hide
her
feelings
zero
you
were
scared
you
kept
a
secret
you
know
willow
zips
closed
her
backpack
that'sitit's
okay
i
mean
secrets
aren't
bad
you
know
they're
normal
willow
slips
her
pack
onto
her
shoulder
they're
better
than
normal
they're
good
secrets
are
good
must
be
a
reason
why
we
keep
them
right
willow
closes
her
locker
yeah
i
guess
they
start
down
the
hall
so
are
you
going
to
the
bronze
tonight
or
uh
are
you
gonna
sneak
away
for
a
notsosecret
rendezvous
with
angel
none
of
the
above
i'm
gonna
try
and
kill
this
lagos
guy
peace
offering
to
giles
well
angel
has
the
glove
now
right
yep
but
lagos
doesn't
know
that
i
figure
sooner
or
later
he's
bound
to
show
up
at
that
crypt
looking
for
it
ah
but
instead
he
finds
a
buffy
in
a
notsogood
mood
that's
my
brilliant
plan
cut
to
the
bronze
that
evening
xander
makes
his
breaking
shot
at
a
pool
table
he
goes
over
to
the
pocket
where
he
accidentally
sank
his
cue
ball
retrieves
it
and
walks
back
around
the
table
to
continue
practicing
faith
approaches
the
table
you
look
pissed
rough
day
xander
chooses
his
shot
tell
me
about
it
xander
places
the
cue
ball
rather
just
shoot
xander
aims
his
cue
stick
don't
think
i
don't
know
what
you
and
your
pals
were
talking
about
behind
my
back
today
xander
takes
his
shot
yeah
and
what
was
that
xander
looks
for
his
next
shot
more
about
this
glove
deal
than
you're
saying
the
glove
of
myhnegon
right
xander
aims
his
cue
stick
how'd
you
like
a
hit
of
some
real
news
angel's
still
alive
he
takes
his
shot
and
starts
walking
around
the
table
again
looking
for
his
next
shot
faith
looks
at
him
in
wideeyed
surprise
the
vampire
back
in
town
saw
him
myself
toting
the
popular
and
famous
glove
he
bends
down
again
to
take
aim
for
his
shot
angel
xander
makes
this
shot
and
watches
the
balls
ricochet
guy
like
that
with
that
kind
of
glove
could
kill
a
whole
mess
of
people
said
the
same
thing
to
buffy
myself
weird
how
she
didn't
seem
to
care
xander
aims
for
his
next
shot
buffy
knew
he
was
alive
xander
takes
his
shot
i
can't
believe
her
xander
walks
around
the
table
she
says
he's
clean
yeah
well
i
say
we
can't
afford
to
find
out
faith
has
xander's
full
attention
i
say
i
deal
with
this
problem
right
now
i
say
i
slay
can
i
come
he
puts
down
his
cue
stick
and
they
head
out
cut
to
giles'
office
at
the
library
he
is
researching
at
his
desk
he
hears
footsteps
and
turns
around
to
stand
up
and
see
who
it
is
you
wanted
to
see
me
mr
giles
giles
grabs
his
coat
yes
i
do
apologize
for
bringing
you
in
at
this
late
hour
giles
pulls
it
on
please
a
good
watcher
must
be
awake
and
alert
at
all
hours
would
you
like
some
tea
he
tosses
his
glasses
onto
his
desk
and
steps
over
to
his
teamaking
implements
to
prepare
his
teapot
and
two
cups
god
yes
please
i'm
completely
knackered
gwendolyn
goes
to
giles'
chair
i
spent
the
afternoon
training
with
faith
gwendolyn
sits
she
doesn't
lack
for
energy
giles
chuckles
she's
your
first
slayer
i
take
it
if
you're
questioning
my
qualifications
no
i'm
not
giles
pours
water
from
the
kettle
into
his
teapot
i
uh
have
the
utmost
respect
for
your
methods
giles
faces
her
holding
the
teapot
in
my
own
american
way
giles
leans
against
his
desk
i
also
have
the
glove
giles
gwendolyn
looks
at
him
expectantly
oh
not
actually
on
me
but
uh
i
believe
it's
safe
it's
in
a
mansion
on
crawford
street
aaa
friend
of
buffy's
is
keeping
it
there
gwendolyn
stands
up
well
we
must
get
to
it
immediately
hide
it
before
someone
else
finds
it
or
better
still
destroy
it
gwendolyn
surprised
destroy
it
giles
stands
up
and
sets
down
the
teapot
yes
ii
i
didn't
think
it
could
be
done
either
but
giles
goes
to
his
desk
for
a
book
it
involves
transforming
fire
giles
show
her
the
book
into
living
flame
and
immolating
the
glove
gwendolyn
reads
the
pages
where
giles
indicates
iiit's
complex
but
uh
i
believe
i
have
all
the
necessary
materials
he
goes
back
to
his
desk
and
checks
his
gathered
inventory
well
gwendolyn
puts
the
book
down
i
must
say
mr
giles
good
show
she
steps
up
behind
him
and
hits
him
across
the
back
of
the
neck
with
a
wooden
tribal
statue
his
knees
give
and
he
stumbles
but
doesn't
fall
he
turns
to
face
her
giving
her
a
stunned
look
good
show
indeed
she
swings
the
statue
again
at
his
temple
it
hits
him
hard
and
he
falls
unconscious
to
the
floor
part
3

the
restfield
cemetery
in
front
of
the
von
hauptman
family
crypt
willow
paces
and
buffy
sits
on
a
stone
bench
while
they
wait
for
lagos
to
show
up
um
not
to
downplay
my
own
slaying
abilities
which
in
some
circles
are
considered
formidable
but
shouldn't
faith
be
here
i
tried
calling
but
no
one
was
home
look
if
you're
feeling
any
demonophobia
please
splitting
is
totally
an
option
you're
not
the
one
in
trouble
with
giles
that's
true
willow
continues
pacing
how
long
do
you
think
he
can
stay
angry
at
me
anyway
the
emotional
marathon
man
willow
shrugs
yeah
i
can't
really
blame
him
it's
weird
though
now
that
my
secret
angel
it's
all
out
in
the
open
i
feel
better
well
sure
you
do
this
big
burden's
been
lifted
i
mean
keeping
secrets
is
a
lot
of
work
willow
stops
pacing
one
could
hypothetically
imagine
you
have
no
idea
willow
laughs
uneasily
none
whatsoever
but
willow
sits
next
to
buffy
can
i
ask
you
a
question
willow
buffy
nods
when
you
were
with
angel
and
nobody
knew
about
it
did
that
make
it
feel
you
know
sexier
somehow
not
really
it's
too
much
pressure
after
a
while
it
even
makes
the
fun
parts
not
so
fun
willow
disappointed
oh
buffy
wondering
what's
up
what
makes
you
think
all
this
secret
stuff
is
sexy
anyway
willow
nervously
defensive
nothing
i'm
just
wondering
gotta
keep
asking
the
big
old
questions
when
you're
blessed
with
this
girl's
thirst
for
knowledge
and
willow
gives
in
okay
there's
something
i
have
to
tell
you
what
willow
gets
up
okay
this
will
make
me
feel
better
right
you
know
i
always
consider
myself
a
good
person
floss
do
my
homework
never
cheat
but
lately
and
please
don't
judge
me
on
this
but
i
want
you
to
be
the
first
to
know
that
that
willow
sees
lagos
there's
a
demon
behind
you
buffy
looks
behind
her
and
kicks
her
legs
up
to
spin
herself
around
on
the
bench
she
uses
the
momentum
of
the
spin
to
start
a
running
attack
she
jumps
into
a
twin
pike
kick
to
lago's
stomach
it
has
no
real
effect
on
lagos
just
making
him
take
a
step
backward
as
she
falls
flat
to
the
ground
willow
looks
on
worried
and
unable
to
help
lagos
reaches
down
for
buffy
and
grabs
her
by
the
neck
he
pulls
her
up
only
to
flip
her
back
down
to
the
ground
in
a
sloppy
front
tuck
she
lands
hard
on
her
back
willow
wants
to
help
but
can
only
watch
buffy
gets
to
her
feet
and
comes
at
lagos
with
a
combination
of
a
punch
to
the
gut
and
the
face
a
half
spin
a
backhand
punch
to
the
face
another
half
spin
and
another
backhand
punch
she
tries
for
an
elbow
jab
but
he
blocks
it
grabs
her
arm
and
reaches
for
her
leg
and
lifts
her
up
above
his
head
willow
is
afraid
for
her
friend
and
waves
her
hands
wildly
in
protest
don't
lagos
suddenly
drops
buffy
and
she
lands
hard
on
her
back
willow
cringes
at
the
sight
buffy
quickly
gets
to
her
feet
and
steps
to
her
right
as
lagos
swings
a
fist
at
her
head
he
misses
her
and
smashes
his
fist
into
a
stone
cross
taking
advantage
of
the
opening
buffy
steps
in
and
front
snap
kicks
him
in
the
gut
following
up
with
a
roundhouse
kick
to
his
face
a
full
spin
and
another
roundhouse
kick
to
his
crotch
lagos
doubles
over
in
pain
willow
winces
at
how
painful
it
looked
buffy
spies
the
battleax
on
his
back
now
we're
talking
she
grabs
the
ax
pulls
it
from
its
sheath
and
swings
it
around
as
lagos
straightens
back
up
in
one
stroke
lagos
is
suddenly
headless
his
head
rolls
along
the
ground
a
ways
before
coming
to
rest
willow
pumps
her
fists
into
the
air
in
front
of
her
yes
she
quickly
plays
down
her
gesture
into
crossed
arms
buffy
comes
walking
back
to
her
sorry
about
that
so
what
were
you
saying
oh
i
willow
decides
against
a
confession
i
opened
my
sat
test
booklet
five
minutes
early
willow
buffy
gives
her
a
blank
look
just
doesn't
seem
important
now
does
it
buffy
smiles
your
secret's
safe
with
me
buffy
looks
at
lagos'
body
come
on
let's
go
bring
giles
some
happiness
she
shoulders
the
battleax
and
the
two
girls
head
for
the
library
cut
to
the
library
faith
and
xander
barge
in
and
head
for
the
cage
and
the
weapons
cabinet
within
good
old
sunnydale
library
fully
equipped
with
reference
books
file

could
actually
do
such
a
thing
and
then
runs
from
the
library
willow
watches
her
go
then
looks
at

gwendolyn
looks
it
over
if

angel
steps
up
to
the
flame
good
where

the
glove
it's
in
the
trunk
he
turns
around
again
to
get
the
glove
from

gwendolyn
grabs
a
shovel
that's
leaning
against

and
swings
it
hard
into

falls
to

hurries
over
to
the
trunk
and
tries
to
open
it
she
finds
it
locked
bugger
she
tries
yanking
at
the
old
padlock
but
it
doesn't
give
bugger
she
takes
the
shovel
and
jams
it
into
the
padlock
a
few
times
the
old
lock
breaks
readily
she
reaches
down
to
remove
it
behind
her
angel
gets
up
from
the
floor
sporting
his
game
face
okay
gwendolyn
looks
at
him
in
surprise
that
hurt
gwendolyn
holds
the
shovel
defensively
it
was
supposed
to
kill
you
if
you'd
been
human
it
would
have
but
gwendolyn
breaks
the
handle
over
her
knee
i
believe
this
is
your
poison
she
swings
at
angel's
midsection
with
her
long
makeshift
stake
but
he
sidesteps
her
to
avoid
the
blow
she
swings
back
the
other
way
but
this
time
aims
for
his
face
and
he
ducks
it
she
swings
again
but
angel
middle
blocks
the
hit
and
takes
the
opportunity
to
punch
her
in
the
face
she
falls
down
hard
and
loses
her
grip
on
the
shovel
handle
she
scrambles
onto
all
fours
and
starts
to
make
a
run
for
it
angel
circles
around
the
urn
with
the
living
flame
grabs
her
by
the
back
of
the
neck
as
she
rises
to
her
feet
pushes
down
on
her
neck
to
stop
her
and
throws
her
against
a
wall
she
slides
to
the
floor
nearly
unconscious
angel
grabs
her
by
the
shoulder
just
as

blow
taking
only
a
slight
step
backward
gwendolyn
begins
to
come
to
and
watches
the
fight
angel
does
a
backhand
swing
to
faith's
head
making
it
snap
back
and
to
the
side
she
whirls
back
around
infuriated
and
delivers
a
backhand
punch
to
his
face
followed
immediately
with
another
punch
angel
tries
to
return
with
a
punch
but
he
swings
too
wide
and
faith
has
plenty
of
time
to
duck
it
angel's
follow
through
leaves
him
in
an
awkward
position
and
faith
takes
immediate
advantage
she
bends
over
his
right
side
and
holds
onto
him
for
support
as
she
kicks
up
backwards
hitting
him
in
the
head
with
a
reverse
snap
kick
he
is
dazed
with
pain

steps
away
from

down
on
the
back
of

right
knee
causing
him
to
collapse

grabs
angel
by
the
shirt
and
launches
him
into
the
air

lands
on

side
of

couch
and
backrolls
over
the
coffee

to
the

right
angle

is
severely
stunned

runs
over
to
him
sees
that
he
is
defenseless
and
raises
her
stake
she
swings
down
hard
with

directly
at
his
chest
when
out
of
nowhere
an
arm
reaches
in
and
stays
her
swing
she
looks
to
her
side
and
sees
that
it's
buffy

catalyst
for

sand
willow
looks
at
xander
worried
we'll
have
to
test
this
i'll
doublecheck
he
reads
through
his
book
and
willow
notices
his
suddenly
intent
stare
while
reading
what
i
know
what
the
glove
does
he
angles
the
book
so
she
can
read
and
points
to
a
passage
she
quickly
absorbs
the
information
there's
no
time
to
test
this
she
quickly
grabs
a
plastic
bag
and
pulls
it
open
xander
blows
out
the
candles
on
the
table
grabs
the
grinding
bowl
and
pours
the
mix
into
the

whirls
around
and
punches

hand
catching

off
guard

leans
in
again

drops
to

jumps
to

kick
that
hits

fingers
and
pulls
them
backward
cracking
her
knuckles
auuuugh
now

is
able
to
throw

off
with
a
twist
of

beeline
for

with
the
glove

throws

and
unfolds

off

the
glove
in
her
left
hand
and
looks
down
at

slowly
she
slides
her
right
arm
into
the
glove
once
it's
inside
she
makes
a
fist
with
the
clawed
fingers
suddenly
the
metal
claws
surrounding
the
glove's
opening
begin
closing
puncturing
her
arm
one
at
a
time
until
all
ten
have
become
permanently
embedded
in
her
forearm's
flesh
she
holds
up
her
gloved
arm
and
smiles
maniacally
at
the
sight
seemingly
oblivious
to
the
pain
she
extends
her
arm
above

the
gaelic

the
power

in

and

outside

their
fighting
to
see
what's
going
on
inside
gwendolyn
breathes
excitedly
as
she
waits
for
the
power
to
become
hers
lightning
strikes
again
above
the
skylight
outside
buffy
and
faith
stare
at
gwendolyn
still
holding
onto
each
other
not
yet
willing
to
take
the
chance
on
releasing
their
grip
inside
gwendolyn
stares
intently
up
at
the
sky
awaiting
her
reward
for
being
the
new
wearer
of
the
glove
of
myhnegon
outside
the
two
slayers
realize
their
fight
is
no
longer
with
each
other
and
let
go
what's
going
on
gwendolyn
allows
herself
to
be
distracted
lowers
her
gloved
arm
and
looks
over
at
faith
gwendolyn
smiling
maliciously
faith
a
word
of
advice
you're
an
idiot
faith
and
buffy
both
look
at
her
in
disbelief
gwendolyn
once
again
raises
her
arm
to
the
sky
and
utters
the
words
that
will
call
forth
the
power
of
the
glove
tauo
freim
be
free
on
the
floor
willow
wakes
up
and
turns
around
just
in
time
to
see
a
blindlingly
bright
bolt
of
lightning
smash
through
the
skylight
and
strike
the
glove
shards
of
shattered
glass
fall
everywhere
but
gwendolyn
ignores
them
and
rejoices
in
her
newfound
power
she
turns
to
face
the
slayers
and
extends
the
glove
toward
them
tauo
freim
be
free
the
bolt
of
energy
leaps
from
the
glove
at
the
two
girls
they
scramble
out
of
the
way
and
the
bolt
hits
a
tree
in
the
atrium
instantly
setting
it
ablaze
buffy
and
faith
look
at
it
in
amazement
then
turn
their
attention
to
what
they
can
do
about
gwendolyn
angel
also
comes
to
now
and
quickly
takes
in
the
situation
willow
gets
to
her
feet
and
begins
backing
away
stiff
with
fear
staring
at
gwendolyn
in
shocked
horror
the
wouldbe
watcher
spins
around
and
aims
the
glove
at
her
tauo
freim
be
free
thinking
fast
angel
jumps
to
his
feet
and
rushes
toward
willow
a
lightning
bolt
shoots
through
the
skylight
hits
the
glove
and
is
redirected
at
willow
angel
reaches
her
just
in
time
and
roughly
tackles
her
to
the
floor
out
of
harm's
way
the
bolt
hits
the
fireplace
instead
and
leaves
a
deep
scorch
mark
in
the
marble
outside
buffy
comes
up
with
a
plan
buffy
to
faith
can
you
draw
her
fire
you
bet
i
can
go
do
it
faith
gets
to
her
feet
and
runs
into
the
mansion
gwendolyn
sees
her
coming
faith
ducks
into
a
hallway
and
keeps
running
gwendolyn
surmises
that
faith
will
appear
at
the
other
hallway
leading
from
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
and
extends
her
arm
in
that
direction
tauo
freim
be
free
another
lightning
bolt
strikes
the
glove
and
is
sent
in
the
direction
of
the
hallway
just
as
faith
comes
running
out
of
it
she
dives
behind
the
couch
avoiding
the
blast
from
the
glove
thrilled
with
the
power
that
is
now
hers
gwendolyn
holds
the
glove
up
before
her
staring
at
it
with
lustful
desire
in
her
eyes
there's
nothing
you
can
do
to
me
now
outside
buffy
sifts
through
the
broken
glass
finds
a
larger
shard
gets
to
her
feet
and
runs
into
the
mansion
i
have
the
glove
with
the
glove
comes
the
power
i'm
getting
that
gwendolyn
looks
over
at
buffy
in
surprise
buffy
throws
the
shard
of
glass
end
over
end
it
flies
like
a
spinning
blade
at
gwendolyn
and
slices
cleanly
through
her
upper
arm
severing
it
and
the
glove
from
her
body
with
nothing
to
control
it
now
the
power
of
the
glove
becomes
erratic
and
small
bolts
and
sparks
leap
from
it
in
random
directions
another
bolt
of
lightning
strikes
through
the
skylight
and
not
having
a
target
this
time
hits
gwendolyn
in
the
chest
with
a
few
small
tendrils
going
in
through
her
eyes
she
screams
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
as
her
body
begins
to
writhe
in
pain
everyone
watches
helplessly
as
she
keeps
screaming
and
the
lightning
bolts
keep
coming
buffy
shuts
her
eyes
to
the
sight
a
moment
later
with
one
final
bright
lightning
strike
what's
left
of
a
onearmed
gwendolyn
vanishes
in
a
bright
flash
of
light
and
energy
a
few
small
arcs
of
electricity
are
all
that
remain
as
the
last
of
the
energy
dissipates
and
the
mansion
is
again
in
relative
darkness
buffy
opens
her
eyes
willow
and
angel
get
to
their
feet
outside
xander
gets
up
also
and
heads
inside
faith
stands
up
from
behind
the
couch
all
that
is
left
in
the
center
of
the
room
are
bits
of
glass
and
framework
from
the
skylight
a
cloud
of
smoke
slowly
rising
upward
and
the
glove
of
myhnegon
with
gwendolyn's
severed
arm
still
firmly
in
its
grip
one
by
one
the
ten
claws
open
up
releasing
it
cut
to
sunnydale
high
the
next
day
cut
to
the
student
lounge
willow
and
oz
are
sitting
on
one
of
the
couches
across
the
coffee
table
from
xander
and
cordelia
who
are
sitting
on
the
other
so
there's
no
more
glove
thingy
no
little
living
flame
little
mesquite
gone
for
good
sounds
like
we
missed
a
lot
of
fun
then
we're
telling
it
wrong
what
do
you
think
buffy
and
angel
are
gonna
do
boy
do
i
don't
know
xander
nods
cordelia
gives
him
a
strange
look
well
he
saved
me
from
a
horrible
flamey
death
that
sort
of
makes
me
like
him
again
willow
smiles
thinly
well
as
long
as
she
and
angel
don't
get
pelvic
we'll
be
okay
i
guess
cordelia
doesn't
like
the
way
xander
phrased
that
and
crosses
her
arms
buffy
walks
up
the
stairs
to
meet
them
xander
sits
up
straight
what
are
you
guys
talking
about
oddly
enough
your
boyfriend
again
buffy
looks
down
sadly
he's
not
my
boyfriend
buffy
sits
next
to
xander
really
truly
he's
buffy
sighs
i
don't
know
she
looks
over
at
xander
and
cordelia
they
both
look
back
buffy
hesitatingly
are
we
cool
yeah
just
seeing
the
two
of
you
kissing
after
everything
that
happened
i
leaned
toward
the
postal
xander
pauses
but
i
trust
you
i
don't
just
for
the
record
buffy
raises
her
eyebrows
not
all
that
surprised
behind
her
giles
clears
his
throat
and
she
turns
to
face
him
he's
leaning
against
the
railing
with
a
large
bandage
on
his
left
temple
let
me
guess
gwendolyn
post
not
a
watcher
yes
she
was
giles
cautiously
takes
the
steps
she
was
uh
kicked
out
by
the
council
a
couple
of
years
ago
for
misuses
of
dark
power
they
swear
there
was
a
memo
well
i
better
go
buffy
to
xander
little
more
damage
control
she
gets
up
and
heads
out
of
the
lounge
willow
sighs
the
whole
angel
thing
is
so
weird
giles
slowly
sits
next
to
xander
yes
well
we'll
have
to
see
how
that
unfolds
won't
we
cut
to
faith's
motel
room
she's
lying
on
the
bed
flipping
through
a
magazine
and
watching
dragnet
in
black
and
white
a
man
opens
his
door
to
talk
with
the
officers
yes
sir
police
officers
my
name's
friday
this
is
there's
a
knock
on
faith's
door
how
are
you
come
in
buffy
opens
the
door
peeks
in
and
then
comes
into
the
room
hey
called
the
police
just
a
little
while
ago
talked
to
a
man
down
there
i
didn't
get
his
name
though
the
place
looks
nice
yeah
it's
real
spartan
can
you
show
us
where
they
broke
in
please
how
are
you
fivebyfive
i'll
interpret
that
as
good
faith
doesn't
respond
but
just
continues
paging
through
her
magazine
look
gwendolyn
post
or
whoever
she
may
be
had
us
all
fooled
even
giles
faith
without
looking
up
yeah
well
you
can't
trust
people
i
should've
learned
that
by
now
i
realize
this
is
gonna
sound
funny
coming
from
someone
that
just
spent
a
lot
of
time
kicking
your
face
but
you
can
trust
me
faith
looks
up
amused
is
that
right
faith
tosses
the
magazine
aside
i
know
i
kept
secrets
but
i
didn't
have
a
choice
i'm
on
your
side
i'm
on
my
side
faith
nods
and
that's
enough
buffy
shakes
her
head
not
always
faith
shrugs
is
that
it
yeah
i
guess
alright
well
then
i'll
see
you
she
averts
her
eyes
and
stares
at
the
tv
buffy
takes
the
hint
and
turns
to
go
faith
shakes
her
head
having
a
second
thought
uh
buffy
buffy
faces
her
expectantly
yeah
faith
reconsiders
again
for
a
long
moment
and
changes
her
mind
again
nothing
buffy
lowers
her
eyes
disappointed
slowly
she
turns
back
to
the
door
opens
it
and
leaves
faith
looks
around
her
spartan
room
and
inhales
and
exhales
deeply
cut
outside
buffy
goes
over
to
the
stairs
and
pauses
for
a
moment
staring
sadly
into
space
and
then
starts
down
the
steps
cut
inside
the
camera
pulls
back
on
faith
alone
in
her
bed
staring
out
of
the
window
for
a
moment
then
back
at
the
tv
