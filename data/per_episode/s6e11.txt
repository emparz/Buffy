crazy
hard
on
her
as
it
is
buffy
turns
away
as
she
continues
talking
dawn
rolls
her
eyes
and
turns
to
pick
up
the
statue
buffy
on
the
sofa
moving
cushions
around
any
reminder
of
of
what
it
is
that
she's
trying
to
stay
away
from
you
know
could
cause
her
to
give
in
to
temptation
buffy
digs
among
the
sofa
cushions
and
finds
something
it's
a
cigarette
lighter
she
flips
it
open
and
stares
at
it
flash
to
buffy
and
spike
in
the
abandoned
building
kissing
and
slamming
each
other
up
against
the
walls
flash
back
to
the
present
buffy
still
stares
at
the
lighter
and
that
would
be
bad
she
turns
and
tosses
the
lighter
into
the
cardboard
box
cut
to
a
closeup
of
the
stolen
diamond
seen
through
a
magnifying
glass
a
hand
takes
it
out
of
its
blackvelvetlined
case
and
holds
it
up
cut
out
to
reveal
warren
wearing
safety
goggles
and
sitting
at
a
workbench
a
device
of
some
sort
vaguely
machinegunshaped
is
on
the
bench
in
front
of
him
he
puts
the
diamond
into
a
space
on
top
of
the
device
in
the
middle
of
a
star
shape
formed
by
six
metal
spikes
he
places
a
glass
cover
over
the
diamond
warren
triumphant
okay
that's
it
it's
finally
done
jonathan
and
andrew
come
up
behind
him
to
look
i
mean
it
still
needs
a
trial
run
but
it's
jonathan
kind
of
clunkylooking
what
i
pictured
something
cooler
more
ilm
less
ed
wood
warren
gets
up
angrily
you
wanna
see
cool
i'll
show
you
cool
warren
picks
up
the
device
jonathan
and
andrew
look
alarmed
back
away
warren
points
the
device
at
them
for
a
moment
then
turns
away
fiddling
with
the
controls
the
device
makes
a
whirring
noise
as
the
starshaped
bit
on
top
spins
around
a
bolt
of
reddish
light
shoots
out
and
hits
one
of
the
leather
chairs
on
the
platform
the
chair
disappears
the
geeks
stare
in
awe
andrew
pushes
past
the
others
and
goes
over
to
where
the
chair
was
jonathan
follows
slowly
mama
warren
watches
with
a
smirk
andrew
and
jonathan
stand
on
either
side
of
where
the
chair
was
andrew
makes
gestures
like
he's
feeling
around
in
the
air
did
it
is
it
yeah
jonathan
grins
excitedly
turns
and
very
carefully
sits
down
on
the
invisible
chair
he
spins
around
a
few
times
giggles
crazily
andrew
stares
in
awe
jonathan
laughing
to
warren
i'd
call
that
a
successful
test
well
that's
just
half
the
test
warren
begins
flipping
switches
again
the
diamond
begins
to
whirl
hey
hey
andrew
leaps
for
cover
and
jonathan
pulls
his
arms
and
legs
up
to
shield
himself
as
warren
zaps
him
again
the
chair
reappears
jonathan
looks
nervously
at
his
arms
making
sure
he's
still
visible
then
gets
up
angrily
you
penis
oh
cheer
up
frodo
because
thanks
to
my
brains
and
our
mystical
gem
we
got
ourselves
an
invisibility
ray

pretty
much
unstoppable

small
sigh
of
pleasure

ms
summers
your
sister's
grades
have
fallen
sharply
in
the
last
year
due
in
large
part
to
her
frequent
absences
and
lateness
but
therethere
are
good
reasons
oh
i'm
sure
there
are
but
my
interest
is
in
dawn's
welfare
and
the
stability
of
her
home
life
something
i'm
just
not
convinced
that
an
unemployed
young
woman
like
yourself
can
provide
i
can
i
i
do
well
we'll
just
have
to
see
about
that
then
won't
we
she
goes
to
the
door
stops
and
turns
back
oh
and
i'm
uh
going

immediate
probation
in
my
report
what

that
mean
it
means
that

be
monitoring

very
closely
ms
summers
and
if
i
don't
see
that
things
are
improving
well
i'll
be
forced
to
recommend
that
you
be
stripped
of
your
sister's
guardianship
you
can't
do
that
ms
kroger
opens
the
door
i
do
what

a
nice
day

lunges
forward
and
pins
buffy
against
the
wall
one
hand
on
the
wall
beside
her
head
their
faces
are
inches
apart
spike
does
something
with
his

hand
out

and
buffy
closes
her
eyes
breathes
heavily
close
shot
of
spike's
hand
inside
buffy's
front
jeans
pocket
moving
around

he
pulls
out
his
lighter
and
holds
it
up
in

of
her
face
just
getting
what
i
came
for
luv

moves
in
closer
as
if
to
kiss
her
but
then

away
and
strides
off
down
the
hall
toward
the
kitchen
spike
not
looking
back
so
long
goldilocks
buffy
sighs
stands
there
breathing
a
little
heavily
and
looking
upset
after
a
moment
she
moves
away
from
the
wall
cut
to
buffy's
room
she
walks
in
slams
the
door
and
leans
against
it
looking
upset
whimpering
a
little
she
puts
her
face
in
her
hands
then
walks
forward
shaking
her
arms
and
moving
her
shoulders
around
she
paces
a
bit
sits
down
in
front
of
her
vanity
table
puts
her
head
in
her
hands
again
then
she
lifts
her
head
looks
at
herself
in
the
mirror
she
turns
to
open
a
drawer
searches
through
it
closes
it
opens
another
drawer
takes
out
a
pair
of
scissors
she
grabs
a
fistful
of
her
hair
and
chops
it
off
with
the
scissors
she
drops
the
hair
on
the
floor
and
starts
cutting
off
another
piece
looking
angrily
at
her
reflection
shot
of
the
locks
of
hair
lying
on
the
carpeted
floor
cut
to
close
shot
of
a
woman
with
a
wild
tousled
hairdo
well
ii
think
i
can
work
with
this
we
see
that
she's
standing
behind
buffy
who
sits
in
a
barber's
chair
both
looking
at
buffy
in
the
mirror
buffy's
shorn
hair
is
about
shoulderlength
and
all
uneven
what
exactly
would
you
like
me
to
do
just
make
me
different
cut
to
the
street
day
warren
emerges
from
the
rear
of
the
geeks'
black
van
closes
the
door
and
walks
around
the
side
of
the
van
carrying
something
covered
by
a
cloth
andrew
and
jonathan
appear
on
either
side
of
him
walking
we
see
that
they're
in
an
alley
i'm
scared
what
if
we
get
caught
no
way
we'll
be
invisible
plus
their
security's
gotten
lax
warren
chuckles
you
should
know
you've
cased
this
joint
enough
they
emerge
from
the
alley
onto
a
main
street
turn
the
corner
and
approach
a
large
storefront
the
sign
in
the
window
reads
spa
women
only
bikini
wax
wednesdays
and
a
cartoon
picture
of
a
woman
okay

others

warren
removes
the
black
cloth
revealing
the
invisibility
ray
gun

professionals
the
others
nod
uncertainly
andrew
looks
away
long
shot
of
buffy
emerging
from
the
hairdresser's
across
the
street
her
hair
is
now
neatly
styled
at
shoulderlength
she
begins
to
walk
across
the
sidewalk
andrew
nudging
jonathan
nervously
uh
slayer
what
whwhere
there
headed
this
way
warren
turns
to
look
fearfully
buffy
walks
between
some
parked
cars
one
minivan
with
bumper
stickers
reading
god
bless
america
and
united
we
stand
and
begins
to
cross
the
street
cut
back
to
warren
staring
at
her
he
lifts
his
hand
and
suddenly
realizes
the
invisibility
ray
isn't
in
it
he
turns
and
realizes
that
the
other
two
geeks
aren't
standing
behind
him
any
more
jonathan
os
give
it
cut
to
the
alley
just
around
the
corner
andrew
and
jonathan
are
fighting
over
the
ray

runs
around
the
corner
and
finds
them

warren
runs
over
and
tries
to
get
the
ray
away
from
them
the
bit
on
top
is
spinning
and
the
whirring
noise
intensifies
suddenly
the
red
light
bursts
out
of
the
invisibility
ray
it
hits
buffy
as
she
walks
past
the
mouth
of
the
alley
it
also
hits
a
tree
a
fire
hydrant
some
traffic
cones
and
a
dumpster
all
of
which
immediately
disappear
the
geeks
stare
in
dismay

to
freaking
out
about
noshow
buffy
anya

looks
chastised
this
is
serious
i
know
it
kind
of
fits
the
day
i've
had
the
camera
moves
over
to
a
table
where
there's
a
basket
full
of
baseballsized
balls
one
of
them
lifts
into
the
air
and
begins
moving
around
as
if
buffy
is
tossing
it
from
hand
to
hand
willow's
still
a
wreck
dawn's
mad
at
both
of
us
and
the
social
services
lady
put
me
through
a
wringer
says
she's
gonna
watch
me
i'd
like
to
see
her
try
now
invisible
buffy
holds
up
a
second
ball
the
balls
have
symbols
painted
on
them
that
make
them
look
a
little
like
eyes
she
holds
them
next
to
each
other
moves
them
as
if
the
eyes
are
looking
side
to
side
you
know
there
may
be
an
upside
to
noseeme
invisible
buffy
the
balls
float
over
toward
anya
buff
did
you
say
anyone
or
anything
suspicious
before
you
cleared
out
buffy
continues
playing
with
the
'eyes'
next
to
anya's
head
making
anya
nervous
she
turns
them
so
they
look
crosseyed
nope
didn't
see
nothin'
invisible
buffy
laughs
see
what
i
did
there
with
the
eyeballs
anya
nervously
to
xander
why
would
anyone
make
her
invisible
anyway
i
mean
invisible
slayer's
gotta
be
way
more
effective
than
the
standard
variety
through
this
the
'eyeballs'
turn
to
'look'
at
anya
and
then
at
xander
now
they
move
away
we
hear
buffy's
footsteps
yeah
i'm
less
with
the
why
and
more
with
the
how
we
get
the
how
then
we
got
how
to
make
her
unseen
sight
seen
again
right
a
human
skull
floats
up
beside
xander's
shoulder
its
mouth
moves
up
and
down
'saright
xander
annoyed
buffy
could
you
focus
please
invisible
buffy
making
the
skull
'look
around'
i
am
just
this
is
kind
of
fun
well
it
would
help
if
we
had
a
little
bit
more
to
go
on
or
anything
to
go
on
well
i
could
go
check
the
spot
where
buffy
disappeared
snoop
for
clues
invisible
buffy
putting
skull
back
on
a
shelf
yeah
right
uh
hey
you
know
what
i'm
just
gonna
go
for
a
walk
invisible
buffy
footsteps
heading
toward
the
door
a
walk
yeah
um
clear
my
head
invisible
buffy
xander
following
her
toward
the
door
you
guys
keep
working
on
those
whats
and
hows
invisible
buffy
laughs
clear
my
head
the
door
opens
buffy
the
door
closes
anya
grimaces
and
shrugs
sits
down
in
front
of
the
seating
plan
again
well
seems
pretty
obvious
it's
some
kind
of
spell
that's
done
this
to
her
spell
from
who
you
said
it
yourself
it
makes
no
sense
for
one
of
her
enemies
to
make
her
invisible
maybe
it's
a
mistake
a
magical
mistake
xander
small
laugh
who'd
be
messing
with
that
kind
of
pow
suddenly
he
stops
looking
thoughtful
anya
turns
to
look
at
him
cut
to
the
summers
house
dining
room
pan
across
the
table
covered
with
open
books
willow's
computer
is
set
up
at
the
end
of
the
table
and
she
sits
in
front
of
it
drinking
from
a
bottle
of
water
she
puts
the
water
down
picks
up
a
book
and
looks
under
it
looks
under
another
pile
of
books
looks
across
and
sees
the
book
she
wants
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
willow
holds
out
her
hand
the
book
moves
a
little
she
stops
pulls
her
hand
back
sound
of
the
door
opening
willow
willow
os
xander
xander
enters
from
the
front
door
and
walks
into
the
dining
room
willow
looks
guilty
how's
it
going
um
good
willow
xander
sits
i
i
uh
found
out
some
stuff
about
the
diamond
stolen
from
the
museum
willow
xander
not
really
listening
it's
called
the
illuminata
and
there's
rumors
of
it
having
quasimystical
quantum
properties
willow
we
need
to
talk
willow
nervous
we
are
talking
well
i'm
talking
and
you're
looking
at
me
funny
is
there
something
you
wanna
tell
me
they
look
at
each
other
for
a
moment
willow
looks
upset
it
was
nothing
i
ii
didn't
slip
will
nobody's
mad
relapse
is
a
part
of
recovery
we
understand
that
we
just
have
to
figure
a
way
to
fix
it
willow
confused
fix
what
fix
buffy
buffy's
broken
will
you
know
what
i'm
talki

xander
sees
her
expression
you
don't
know
willow
shakes
her
head
still
confused
rhymes
with
'blinvisible'
what
buffy
was
in
town
leaving
the
haircutting
place
when
she
suddenly
just
willow
buffy
got
her
hair
cut
xander
sarcastic
yeah
adorable
apparently
i
personally
couldn't
tell
since
she's
all
'blinvisible'
willow
xander
upset
and
you
think
i
had
something
to
do
with
this
uh
no
not

xander
sighs
well
come
on
will
some
of
the
spells
you've
done
have
caused
some
weird
stuff
to
happen
to
each
of
us
at
one
time
or
another
and
let's
not
forget
the
recent
forgetting
oh
i
see
so
now
when
anything
nasty
happens
i
get
conveniently
blamed
for
it
no
one's
blaming
willow
stands
up
so
i
guess
it
wouldn't
matter
if
i
just
jump
off
the
wagon
completely
since
you
already
think
i'm
making
pit
stops
well
look
if
you
said
you
didn't
do
it

xander
willow
grabs
her
coat
and
goes
past
him
willow
where
you
going
for
a
walk
she
opens
the
front
door
and
exits
xander
watches
her
go
in
dismay
cut
to
the
geek
trio's
underground
lair
warren
is
working
on
the
invisibility
ray
using
a
small
blowtorch
jonathan

bonehead
the

look
around
very
nervously
andrew
quietly
watching
listening
to
every
word
we
say
andrew
very
dramatically
for
all
we
know
she
could
be
one
of
us
warren
and
jonathan
look
each
other
up
and
down
for
a
long
moment
anxiously
suddenly
they
all
burst
into
relieved
laughter
oh
wait
no
guys
that
isn't
true
warren
returning
to
his
work
i
wouldn't
sweat
the
slayer
too
much
says
you
in
my
book
an
invisible
slayer
means
a
whole
world
of
trouble
cut
to
a
park
day
a
young
woman
sits
on
a
bench
reading
a
book
she
wears
a
purple
baseball
cap
the
camera
moves
toward
her
we
can
see
that
the
edges
of
the
cap
are
decorated
with
metal
studs
suddenly
the
cap
lifts
off
the
woman's
head
and
floats
around
in
front
of
her
face
she
looks
very
surprised
invisible
buffy
spooky
voice
i
am
the
ghost
of
fashion
victims
past

looks
scared

up
and
runs
away

favor
the
camera
buffy's
pov
swings
down
to
discover
a
garbage
can
the
cap
drops
into
it
then
the
camera
moves
around
to
see
two
people
jogging
past
naah
too
easy
the
camera
moves
forward
toward
the
street
we
see
a
cop
standing
next
to
a
parked
suv
writing
a
ticket
the
camera
moves
closer
hmm
the
camera
moves
back
to
find
the
cop's
golfcartlike
vehicle
parked
behind
the
suv
cut
back
to
the
cop
he
looks
up
in
surprise
at
the
sound
of
an
engine
starting
so
long
copper
the
golf
cart
drives
past
him
and
on

spun
around
by

he
looks
down
at
his

chest
close
on

frowns
in

gasp
of
pleasure

to
a
dark
residential
street

walks
along
pauses
looks
at
a
house
and
then
at

piece
of
paper
in

covered
by

goes
slowly
down

and
into
the
basement
lair

walks
around
looking
around
she
spots
a
bulletin
board
with
a
large
piece
of
paper
tacked
up
it's
a
blueprint
or
schematic
of
the
invisibility
ray
conveniently
labeled
with

smiles
looks
at

her
which
has
more
blueprints
on

turns
and
walks
across
to
the
workbench
where
the
invisibility

is
still
sitting
willow
takes
a
swivellamp
and
moves
it
over
to
shed
more
light
on
the
invisibility
ray
she
lifts
her
hand
as
if
to
touch
it
warren

willow
turns
in
surprise
reveal
a
roll
of
silver
ducttape
floating
in
the
air
a
few
feet
away
suddenly
willow's
arms
rise
up
as
if
they
had
been
grabbed
by
invisible
hands
she
struggles
hey

of
me
a
piece
of
duct
tape
unrolls
itself
from
the
roll
and
rips
free
it
floats
toward
willow

and
he
looks
confused
the
camera
follows
the
invisible
person
into
the
arcade
a
few
kids
get
shoved
aside
and
go
hey
we
move
further
into
the
arcade
and
discover
willow
standing
by
a
pinball
machine
looking
nervous
just

the
invisibility
ray

to
buffy
and
willow
exiting
the
arcade
willow
still
carries
the
invisibility
ray
pretty
neat
you
finding
the
van
buffy
they
begin
walking
down
the
street
so
how
did
you
manage
to
do
it
exactly
i
mean
to
locate
it
the
hard
way
the
spellfree
way
the
ohmygodmyhead'sgonnafalloff
willow
grimaces
whines
myfeetarekillingme
way
willow
sighs
makes
a
pained
face
sits
down
on
the
edge
of
the
curb
buffy
sits
beside
her
i
don't
know
how
i
got
through
this
day
well
the
important
thing
is
that
you
did
it's
a
good
first
step
how
are
you
doing
postinvisibleness
buffy
shrugs
okay
i
still
have
to
do
some
damage
control
from
my
giddyfest
dawn
was
pretty
freaked
out
buffy
pauses
the
whole
takingavacationfromme
thing
didn't
work
out
so
well
willow
nods
tell
me
about
it
except
when
i
got
xander's
message
you
know
that
i
was
fading
away
i
actually
got
scared
well
yeah
who
wouldn't
me
i
wouldn't
not
too
long
ago
i
probably
would
have
welcomed
it
but
i
realized
i'm
not
saying
that
i'm
doing
backflips
about
my
life
but
buffy
nods
i
didn't
i
don't
wanna
die
buffy
looks
hopefully
at
willow
that's
something
right
it's
something
longer
shot
of
the
two
of
them
sitting
there
sidebyside
on
the
curb
looking
morose
so
