at

the
camera
is
high

angled
down
sharply
on

sitting
on
a
blanket
with
her
legs
covered
by
another
one
and
giles
behind
a
nearby
gravestone
he
has
a
book
open
and
reads
from
it
as
the
camera
pans
down
and
pulls
in
until
it
is
level
with
him
'and
on
that
tragic
day
an
era
came
to
its
inevitable
end'
that's
all
there

me
which
of
the
following
best
expresses
the
theme
of
the
passage

violence

violence
b
all
things
must
end
c
buffy
looks
down
at
her
answer
sheet
and
fills
in
a
bubble
with
her
no
2
pencil
'b'

too
late
to
join
a
tribe
where
they
just
pierce
something
or
cut
something
off
buffy
please
concentrate
giles
looks
back
at
his
book
she
sees
a
vampire
approach
behind
him
roll
she
tosses
her
notebook
and
answer
sheet
off
of
her
lap
and
scrambles
out
from
under
her
blanket
and
to
her
feet
giles
looks
up
what
he
sees
her
rushing
toward
him
instantly
realizes
that
he
needs
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
shoulder
rolls
onto
the
ground
out
of
danger
buffy
vaults
herself
over
the
gravestone
finishing
in
a
roundoff
to
the
ground
and
without
a
moment's
hesitation
side
kicks
the
advancing
vampire
in
the
stomach
he
goes
flying
backward
landing
hard
on
his
back
buffy
rushes
him
grabs
his
legs
and
pushes
them
up
forcing
him
into
a
back
roll
away
from
her
the
vampire
ends
up
in
a
standing
position
and
tries
to
punch
her
but
misses
her
entirely
she
tries
a
punch
but
he
middle
blocks
her
and
takes
a
swing
with
his
free
hand
at
her
face
she
ducks
both
it
and
the
next
punch
he
throws
she
straightens
back
up
and
roundhouse
kicks
him
in
the
side
but
he
keeps
his
balance
and
tries
to
roundhouse
kick
her
in
turn
she
ducks
it
and
his
momentum
carries
him
around
in
a
spin
he
comes
to
a
stop
facing
her
and
tries
to
punch
her
in
the
face
but
she
grabs
onto
his
arm
and
blocks
his
next
punch
he
brings
his
free
hand
up
again
but
she
smashes
her
forearm
down
to
block
it
seeing
an
opening
buffy
takes
her
pencil
and
stabs
him
cleanly
in
the
chest
she
pulls
it
back
out
and
the
vampire
bursts
into
ashes
buffy
starts
back
to
her
blanket
she
looks
at
the
tip
of
her
pencil
and
sees
that
it's
broken
hmm
i
broke
my
no
2
pencil
we'll
have
to
do
this
again
sometime
giles
extends
his
hand
to
her
holding
a
sharpened
no
2
pencil
c
all
systems
tend
towards
chaos
she
flips
her
broken
pencil
at
him
and
snatches
the
new
one
from
his
hand
giles
watches
her
old
pencil
fly
by
him
and
hit
the
ground
next
to
him
buffy
sits
back
down
crosslegged
on
her
blanket
and
picks
up
her
notebook
and
answer
sheet
i
just
know
that
us
and
the
undead
are
the
only
people
in
sunnydale

up
at
giles
and
waits
for

start
reading
again

starts
to
walk
out
from
behind
his
desk

beast

the
way

lives
up

rep
trick

mayor
wilkins
unlocks
the
cabinet
you

that's
what
separates
me
from

mr

he
opens

shelves
are
full
of
occult
paraphernalia
skulls
a
fetus
preserved
in
a

urns
and
chests
a
shrunken
head
the
bones
of
a
forearm
and

and
various
tools
of
the
trade

looks
uneasily
at
all
of
it
from
his
vantage
point
by
the
mayor's
desk
i
keep
my
campaign
promises
he
reaches
in
and
takes
out
the
shrunken
head
he
pulls
on
the
tuft
of
hair
at
the
top
and
a
small
section
of
the
head
pulls
open
and
folds
back
on
the
leathery
skin
the
mayor
takes
a
quick
sniff
from
the
hole
and
closes
the
flap
of
skull
and
skin
again
where'd
i
put

in

practicing
the
slow
elegant
forms
of
t'ai
chi
he
brings
his
arms
down
together
in
front
of
him
and
then
over
to
his
right
as
he
brings
his
left
arm
up
across
his
abdomen
he
crosses
his
right
arm
over
his
left
his

slowly
moves
his
left
arm
out
in

of
him

up
and
extends
his
right
arm
out
to
his
side
he
draws
his
arms
together

this
time
crossing
his
left
arm
over
his
right
and
repeats
a
mirror
image
of
his
last
move
never
stopping
his
motion
he
brings
both
hands
to
his
waist
palms
facing
forward
and
slowly
raises
his
right
arm
and
sweeps
it
across
in

of
himself

down
while
he
sweeps
his
left
arm
across
below
his
right
palm
up
buffy
walks
into
the
doorway
and
stops
just
to
watch
him
amazed
at
the
fluidity
and
smoothness
of
his
motions
angel
doesn't
notice
her
and
continues
the
exercises
he
has
his
arms
extended
his
left
hand
angled
up
sharply
from
his
forearm
and
his
right
hand
clasping
the
heel
of
his
left
he
brings
them
around
in
a
broad
sweeping
motion
toward

and
then
raises
them

them
and
spreads
them
apart
with
his
palms
facing
away
from
him
he
raises
his
head
as
he
does
so
and
sees
buffy
standing
there
watching
him
buffy
she
looks
down
briefly
slightly
embarrassed
to
be
caught
watching
him
like
that
and
then
looks
up
at
him
again
with
a
little
smile
on
her
lips
i
didn't
know
you
could
do
that
he
gives
her
the
briefest
glimpse
of
a
small
smile
as
he
tries
to
straighten
himself
up
from
his
slightly
bent
stance
ii'm
feeling
better
he
can't
maintain
his
posture
and
bends
back
over
supporting
himself
with
his
right
hand
on

knee
buffy
rushes
to
his
aid

under

there
is
an
entire
box
of
them
on
the
coffee
table
next
to
various
picture
books
he
starts
to
unwrap
his
bar
yeah
but
at
least
most
parents
have
some
idea
what
to
protect
their
children
from
yeah
and
i
think
we
should
both
be
especially
careful
he
breaks
off
a
piece
sticks
it
into
his
mouth
and
hands
the
rest
to
joyce
mm
she
takes
a
piece

on
the
table
for
yet
another

cut
to
the
milkbar
factory
makers
of

according
to
the
box
a
worker
opens
the
top
box
of
an
as
yet
unsealed
case
and
reaches
in
for
a
bar
he
pulls
back
the
outer
wrapper
looks
around
to
see
if
anyone
is
watching
and
starts
to
peel
back
the
foil
when
suddenly
ethan
rayne
comes
up
behind
him
and
puts
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
trust
me
ethan
steps
around
the
worker
to
face
him
you
don't
want

ethan
walks
off
as
the
worker
quickly
puts
the
bar
back
into
its
box
before
it
gets
sealed
for
shipping

almost
manages
to
catch
the
paper
snags
it
as
it's
about
to
roll
from

and
sets
it
aside
a
moment
later
he
takes
it
again
and
looks
back
at
the
boy
who
threw
it
watching
for
an
opening
the
camera
closes
in
on
cordelia
and
buffy
sitting
at
the

behind
him
cordelia
sighs
i
heard
that
there
was
a
secret
rule
that
if

more
than
ten
minutes
late
we

all
leave
buffy
looks

tight

fine
even
though
it
was
huge
cordelia
buffy
gives
her
a
look
i
was
sad
to
return
it
cordelia

it
was
perfect
for
starting
conversations
with
college
boys
cordelia
lets
out
a
little
laugh
of
course
that
was
bx
bx
buffy
gets

immediately
whip
their
legs
apart
cut
above
they

hit
opposite

her
thumb
ends
up
on
xander's
and

both
feel
the
electricity
between
them
as
they
allow
the
touch
to
linger
longer
than
it
needs
to
they
look
at
and
then
away
from
each
other
willow

snyder
watches

go
sticks
another
piece
of
chocolate
into
his
mouth
and
lets
out
a
deep
sigh
cut
to
buffy
confronting
ethan
so

pretty
much
in
a
talkor
bleed
situation
your
call
hit
him
buffy
glares
at
him
for
an
instant
then
looks
back
at
ethan
ii'd
just
like
to
point
out
that
this
wasn't
my
idea
giles
paces
behind
buffy
meaning
i'm
subcontracting
it's
trick
you
want
i'm
just
helping
him
collect
a
tribute
for
a
demon
he's
lying
hit
him
i
don't
think
he
is
and
shut
up
giles
excitedly
you're
my
slayer
giles
points
at
ethan
go
knock
his
teeth
down
his
thr
buffy
interrupts
giles
he
turns
away
from
her
and
continues
pacing
buffy
to
ethan
what
demon
i
don't
remember
buffy
punches
him
solidly
in
the
nose
he
stumbles
back
against
the
broken
crate
giles
jumps
and
swings
his
fist
through
the
air
giles
smiles
yes
buffy
gives
giles
a
glaring
look
he
loses
his
smile
lurconis
demon
named
lurconis
they
wanted
a
way
to
get
the
tribute
away
from
people
so
you're
just
diversion
guy
more
than
a
diversion
well
they
said
the
tribute
was
big
so
big
that
people
would
never
let
them
take
it
that
people
had
to
be
out
ofit
and
later
on
when
the
candy
wore
off
they'd
blame
themselves
buffy
sighs
hence
land
of
the
irresponsible
so
where's
trick

up
her
fist
and
gives
ethan
a
threatening

delivering
the
tribute
buffy
steps
closer
which

us
to
the
bonus
question

me
when
i
say
a
wrong
answer
will
cost
you
all
your
points
behind
her
giles

up
joyously
with
a
huge

just
ignores

all
and
watches
her
small
television
four
vampires
boldly
enter
the

and
walk
right
past
the

'principal

and
that's
a
big
'yep'
snyder
eyes
xander
cordelia
willow
and
oz
just
standing
there
in
the
hall
you
look
like
four
young
people
with
too
much
time
on
your
hands
not
really
busy
like
a
bee
actually
cordelia
smiles
beelike
good
it
seems
we
had
some
vandalism
friday
on
school
property
and
i
was
just
looking
for
some
volunteers
to
help
clean
it
up
they
all
look
at
the
bank
of
lockers
just
down
the
hall
willow
reads
the
words
spraypainted
in
the
typical
lettering
style
of
a
rock
band
as
snyder
walks
through
the
group
and
closes
xander's
locker
'kiss
rocks'
why
would
anyone
want
to
kiss
willow
gets
a
look
from
snyder
oh

get
it
snyder
nods
and
continues
on
let's
get
you
some
paint
remover
the
four
of
them
reluctantly
follow
him
cut
to
the
front
of
the
school
giles
and
buffy
walk
toward
the
street
it
was
just
too
much
to
deal
with
it
was
like
nothing
made
sense
anymore
the
things
that
i
thought
i
understood
were
gone
i
just
felt
so
alone
was
that
the
math
or
the
verbal
mostly
the
math
well
if
you
scored
low
then
you
can
take
them
again
more
sats
buffy
sighs
is
there
really
a
point
i
could
die
before
i
even
apply
to
college
the
brakes
of
joyce's
jeep
squeal
as
she
pulls
to
a
stop
at
the
curb
giles
and
buffy
take
the
steps
down
to
the
sidewalk
and
then
you
very
possibly
might
not
well
let's
just
keep
hope
alive
joyce
gets
out
closes
her
door
and
walks
up
onto
the
curb
hello
giles
smiles
awkwardly
joyce
shyly
hi
giles
sees
the
dent
i
say
your
car
seems
to
have
had
an
adventure
doesn't
it
they
all
look
at
the
severely
dented
rear
door
and
back
panel
uh
buffy
assures
me
that
it
happened
battling
evil
so
i'm
letting
her
pay
for
it
on
the
installment
plan
uh
hey
the
way
things
were
going
buffy
points
at
the
dent
be
glad
that's
the
worst
that
happened
at
least
i
got
to
the
two
of
you
before
you
actually
did
something
she
walks
around
to
the
passenger's
side
to
get
in
giles
and
joyce
both
look
at
the
pavement
embarrassed
and
not
willing
even
to
go
there
but
knowing
that
they
did
right
indeed
yyes
they
both
quickly
pivot
and
head
off
in
opposite
directions
