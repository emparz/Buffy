cut
to
a
lecture
hall
professor
walsh
is
lecturing
to
buffy
and
the
class
riley
is
leaning
against
a
wall
so
this
is
what
it
is
talking
about
communication
talking
about
language
not
the
same
thing
it's
about
inspiration
not
the
idea
but
the
moment
before
the
idea
when
its
total
when
it
blossoms
in
your
mind
and
connects
to
everything
it's
about
the
thoughts
and
experiences
that
we
don't
have
a
word
for
a
demonstration
buffy
summers
come
on
down
to
the
front
here
buffy
walks
down
a
typical
college
girl
one
assumes
walsh
to
buffy
lie
down
on
my
desk
what
go
ahead
you're
perfectly
safe
oh
buffy
sits
then
lies
on
the
desk
but
doesn't
completely
lie
down
she
is
resting
on
her
elbows
riley
if
you
could
oblige
a
demonstration
right
be
a
good
boy
riley
leans
over
buffy
he
puts
a
hand
on
her
waist
this
feels
very
strange
don't
worry
if
i
kiss
you
it'll
make
the
sun
go
down
they
kiss
and
the
class
watches
he
brings
a
hand
around
her
holding
her
up
and
she
brings
her
arm
around
him
and
then
to
his
neck
they
continue
to
kiss
and
it
gets
darker
the
classroom
is
empty
when
the
camera
zooms
out
from
them
see
she
sits
up
fortune

the
brave
faintly
a
little
girl
is
humming
or
chanting

hear
that
buffy
walks
towards
the
sound

eventually
sees
a
little
girl
holding
an
ornate
box
