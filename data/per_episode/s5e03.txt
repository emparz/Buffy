there's
a
bang
another
door
slamming
plaster
dust
from
the
ceiling
drifts
down
onto
anya
yeah

it's
definitely
time
to
start
looking
for
a
new
place
something
a
little
nicer
buffy
you've
been
to
hell
they
have
onebedrooms
right
riley
laughs

book
full
of
zippy
dates
and
zesty
names
buffy
not
listening
i'm
fine
riley
leans
forward
reaching
his
arms
over
buffy's
shoulders
and
placing
his
palms
on
the
book
pages
heyyy
i'm
enjoying
the
studying

movie
i
guess
it
has
been
a
long
day
with
the
crusades
i
can
take
a
little
break
from
the
violence
for
some
buffy
looks
up
at
tv
ooh
fighting
onscreen
the
kungfu
guys
argue
their
mouths
move
and
we
hear
the
english
that
has
been
badly
dubbed
in
incompetentlydubbed
kung
fu
our
most
valuable
chinese
import
much
more
durable
than
their
hot
plates
riley
leans
forward
to
rub
buffy's
shoulders
just
relax
mm
mm
that
feels
good
xander
looks
at
them
cracks
his
knuckles
and
puts
his
hands
on
anya's
shoulders
ow
what
are
you
doing
i
have
a
dislocated
shoulder
anya
xander
stops
rubbing
riley
stops
rubbing
buffy's
shoulders

i'm
trying
to
concentrate
on
the
kicking
movie

rubbing
went
away

rubbing
again
oh
sorry
i
got
caught
up
in

action
riley
gesturing
at
tv
yeah
it's
pretty
good
on
screen
the
fighting
continues
oh
give
me
a
break
this
is
all
wrong
see
first
you
would
get
the
big
guy
with
a
flying
kick
then
you
would
take
out
all
the
little
ones
bam
ba
see
now
with
the
flying
kick
buffy
scornfully
from
a
dead
stop
what's
powering
it
raw
enthusiasm
hey
buff
maybe
you
oughta
leave
the
work
behind
sometimes
you're
not
always
on
slayer
duty
you
know
it
would
drive
you
crazy
if
we
were
watching
an
army
movie
and
they
were
all
saluting
backwards
and
invading
all
willynilly
more
shouting
and
banging
from
upstairs
xander
and
anya
shift
uncomfortably
riley
coughs
and
anyway
i
mean
you
know
you
can't
blame
me
for
being
critical
willow's
the
same
way
when
we
watch
a
a
movie
about
witches
right
xander
xander
distracted
by
the
noise
from
upstairs
what
oh
yeah
she's
all
like
what's
that
a
cauldron
who
uses
a
cauldron
any
more
cut
to
a
dark
lair
filled
with
steam
or
smoke
cheesy
dramatic
music
a
demon
is
tending
to
a
huge
cauldron
full
of
bubbling
yellow
liquid
steam
rises
from
it
the
demon
pulls
the
hood
of
his
cloak
back
so
we
can
see
he
has
brownish
skin
with
cracks
through
which
yellowish
ligh
xander

shows
his
eyes
are
sunken
and
red
and
his
voice
is
very
deep
the
last
step
in
thy
forging
is
my
pain
the
price
with
which
i
purchase
the
death
of
the
slayer
he
has
some
kind
of
rod
or
stick
in
his
hand
he
plunges
it
into
the
cauldron
along
with
his
hand
he
screams

xander
laughs
nervously
anya
can
we
talk
quietly
over
there
xander
to
manager
excuse

he
pulls
anya
aside
leaving
the
other

with

nervously
at
her
uh
we
uh
we
like
the
ceiling
fan

very
you

of
old
south

awful
basement
not

just
until

together
which
is
when
xander
'cause
right
now
things
are
looking
pretty
untogether
and
you
can't
expect
me
just
to
wait
around
for
anya
her
voice
rises
and
the
others
try
not
to
notice
quiet
please
anya
what
is
this
what's
going
on
with
you
anya
loudly
what's
going
on

she
stalks
out
manager
looks
a
little
suspicious
the
others
smile
gamely
xander
with
a
big
fake
smile
i
guess
i'll
just
start
on
that
application
i
think
you'll
like
it
i've
been
told
i
have
lovely
penmanship
he
takes
the
application
puts
it
on
a
counter
and
begins
filling
it
out
manager
watches
looking
skeptical
cut
to
exterior
shot

cut
to
inside
giles
is
surrounded
by
boxes
looking
at
one
giles
to
himself
miscellaneous
curses
giles
laughs
picks
up
something
unidentifiable
from
the
box
brilliant
be
lucky
if
i
don't
curse
my
hands
off
at
the
wrist
he
picks
up
the
box
turns
and
is
confronted
by
toth
oh
toth
raising
his
stick
the
slayer
is
not
here
giles
grabs
something
out
of
the
box
and
holds
it
up
toward
toth
rabbit's
foot
no
wait
giles
tosses
it
aside
and
looks
in
the
box
for
something
else
toth
brushes
the
box
out
of
giles'
hands
giles
gasps
and
holds
up
a
wooden
statue
about
a
foot
and
a
half
high
that
is
a
fertility
god
toth
giles
looks
at
it
in
dismay
feeble
man
you
are
not
going
to
distract
me
giles
hits
him
in
the
head
with
the
statue
he
reels
backward
giles
hits
him
with
the
statue
a
few
more
times
then
toth
shoves
giles
and
he
falls
into
a
pile
of
boxes
toth
pointing
the
stick
at
giles
you
are
not
the
slayer
toth
giles
rolls
over
and
looks
up
at
him
you
do
not
concern
me
toth
turns
and
walks
out
his
black
cape
flowing
behind
him
giles
watches
stunned
then
lets
his
head
drop
back
onto
the
floor
with
a
groan
cut
to
a
shot
of
giles
standing
holding
the
statue
making
hitting
motions
like
this
and
this
and
this
the
camera
follows
him
as
he
moves
across
the
magic
shop
floor
and
we
see
riley
buffy
willow
and
xander
the
girls
sit
on
the
floor
with
books
in
their
laps
the
guys
are
standing
around
watching
giles
demonstrate
what
happened
that
thing's
pretty
heavy
that's
oofdar
goddess
of
childbirth
she's
got
some
nice
heft
to
her
how
badly
did
you
hurt
him
well
hurt
uh
maybe
not
hurt
well
ii'm
sure
he
was
startled
uh
yes
yes
i'd
imagine
it
gave
him
uh
rather
a
turn
buffy
grinning
he
ran
away
huh
um
sort
of
more
uh
turned
and
swept
out
majestically
i
suppose
he
said
i
didn't
concern
him
so
a
mythic
triumph
over
a
completely
indifferent
foe
giles
insulted
well
i'm
not
dead
or
unconscious
so
i
say
bravo
for
me
willow
holding
up
a
book
some
good
demons
in
this
one
see
if
your
guy's
in
here
giles
walks
over
to
take
the
book
so
you
bought
the
magic
shop
and
you
were
attacked
before
it
opened
who's
up
for
a
swingin'
chorus
of
the
we
told
you
so
symphony
riley
hefting
the
oofdar
statue
owning
this
place
does
seem
kinda
dangerous
riley
takes
a
few
experimental
swings
giles
looking
up
from
the
book
toth
what
he
called
you
a
toth
it's
a
british
expression
it
means
like
moron
no
toth
is
the
name
of
the
demon
giles
sees
xander
holding
a
crystal
be
careful
with
that
giles
xander
looks
around
at
the
others
puts
the
crystal
down
carefully
ancient
demon
very
strong
last
survivor
of
the
tothric
clan
it
also
says
that
for
a
demon
he's
unusually
sophisticated
sophisticated
so
i
should
discuss
men's
fashions
with
him
before
i
chop
his
head
off
giles
exasperated
they're
referring
to
the
fact
that
he
does
not
fight
barehanded
he
uses
tools
devices
oh
he's
also
supposed
to
be
very
focused
and
since
he
mentioned
the
slayer
i
think
we
know
what
the
focus
is
he
mentioned
buffy
where
do
we
find
him
and
how
hard
can
i
kill
him
giles
consulting
book
well
there's
no
mention
of
the
types
of
places
he
might
frequent
but

giles
closes
book
and
stands
up
i
have
an
idea
giles
walks
around
talking
thoughtfully
he
had
a
very
specific
olfactory
presence
well
i
guess
we're
off
to
the
olfactory
i
hate
that
place
xander
everyone
rolls
their
eyes
at
him
i'm
joking
i
know
what
it
means
he
smelled
xander
uncertainly
right
some
demon
rituals
involve
anointing
with
oils
was
it
sort
of
sandalwoody
um
not
even
remotely
but
he
was
very
um
distinctive
cut
to
exterior
location
night
giles
xander
buffy
riley
and
willow
walk
along
cautiously
buffy
carries
a
large
axe
the
city
dump
where

to
relax
and
be
themselves
people
say
they're
recycling
riley
shakes
head
they're
not
recycling
riley
xander
pats
him
on
the
shoulder
i
found
a
spell
so
you
can't
smell
anything
but
it
does
it
by
taking
your
nose
off
so
no
they
hear
noises
and
see
someone
rooting
around
in
the
trash
what

has
a
crossbow
spike

arm
and
the
lamp
in
a
shopping
cart
nearby
spike
um
we're
looking
for
a
demon
um
tall
robed
skin
sort
of
hanging
off
deep
voice
you
mean
a
great
tall
robey
thing
like
that
one
spike
pointing
behind

toth
standing
there

points
his
stick
at
them
fire
flashes
out
of
it
and
they
all
duck
just
in
time
take

yeah

take
it
slowly
they
walk
off
the
camera
pans
slowly
back
across
the
piles
of
trash
among
the
bags
we
see
another
xander
lying
apparently
unconscious
blackout
act
ii

fade
in
on
the
city
dump
day
the
camera
pans
across
mounds
of
trash
to
where
scruffyxander

lying
yawning
and
beginning
to
wake
up
eyes
closed
he
makes
a
disgusted
face
anya

trying
to
use
the
hot
plate
again
slowly
he
opens
his
eyes
looks
around

can
hear
flies
buzzing
uhoh
he
gets
up
and
walks
off
cut
to
scruffyxander
walking
around
the
corner
of
his
parents'
house
looking
confused
and
disheveled
he
goes
down
the
outer
stairs
to
his
basement
door
tries
to
open
it
but
it's
locked
he
knocks
anya
an

lies
on

smoothly
ducking
underneath
a
big
pipe
being
carried
by
two
other
guys
the
door
of
the
portapotty
opens
and
smacks
scruffyxander
in

a
hardhatted
guy
exiting

puts
a

to
his

harris
where's
your
hard

makes
a
face
and

does
so
putting

hard
hat
on
the
desk
shot
of
scruffyxander
outside
walking
up
to
the
trailer
trying
to
look
through
the
window
but
it's
too
high
cut
back
inside
how
long
you
work
here
harris
we
see
that
suavexander
has
something
shiny
in
his
hand
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
us
quarter
he's
turning
it
around
in
his
fingers
huh
i'm
not
sure
about
three
months
i
guess
yeah
cut
back
outside
scruffyxander
is
trying
to
make
a
table
to
stand
on
by
pulling
together
some
random
pieces
of
wood
that
were
lying
around
he
climbs
up
on
it
and
peers
in
the
window
we
see
the
boss
and
suavexander
from
scruffyxander's
perspective
boss
os
and
you
haven't
done
much
construction
work
before
this
is
that
right
i
knew

been
firstrate
yeah
we
have
another
job
lined
up
in
carlton
when

finished
here
cut
back
inside
we
see
that
the
shiny
thing
in
suavexander's
hand
is
reflecting
the
light
onto
the
boss's
face
and
chest
you
ever
think
about
staying
on
fulltime
cut
back
outside
what
why
isn't
he
firing
me
him
cut
back
inside
i
was
thinking

you
head
up
our
interior
carpentry
crew

boss
closeup
of
the
shiny
thing
in
suavexander's
hand
reflecting
the
light

how
it
goes
it's
more
responsibility
but
the
pay
is
better
suavexander
enthusiastically
that
would
be
great
cut
to
outside
promotion
but
i
i
mean
he
didn't
doesn't
he
see
the
shiny
thing
scruffyxander
gestures
angrily
at
the
window
this
causes
him
to
lose
his
balance
and
fall
off
his
perch
cut
back
inside
the
boss
shakes
suavexander's
hand
congratulations

night
still
raining
cut

she
enters

some
books
a
moment
later
the
door
bursts
open
and
scruffyxander
comes
in
thoroughly
drenched
don't
be
scared
will
just
listen
it's
me
xander
willow
puts
her
books
on
the
bed
looking
confused
and
i
can
prove
it
um
okay
willow
sits
on
the
bed
let's
see
scruffyxander
paces
stuff
only
you
and
me
know
okay
on
my
seventh
birthday
i
wanted
a
toy
fire
truck
and
i
didn't
get
it
and
you
were
real
nice
about
it
and
then
the
house
next
door
burnt
down
and
then
real
fire
trucks
came
and
for
years
i
thought
you
set
the
fire
for
me
and
if
you
did
you
can
tell
me
scruffyxander
grins
nervously
willow
doesn't
respond
he
paces
more
for
a
while
last
year
i
thought
i
was
lactoseintolerant
but
it
was
just
some
bad
brie
oh
scruffyxander
points
at
willow
every
christmas
we
watch
charlie
brown
together
and
i
do
the
snoopy
dance
he
begins
to
do
the
snoopy
dance
wearing
a
big
grin
willow
watches
for
a
moment
and
then
gets
up
willow
smiling
xander
stop
dancing
aha
you
called
me
xander
xander
shut
up
why
wouldn't
i
think
you
were
xander
oh
huh
what's
goin'
on
scruffyxander
sighs
okay
i
woke
up
in
the
dump
this
morning
xander
the
basement
isn't
a
dump
it
it's
more
like
a
really
nice
hovel
no
the
dump
the
city
dump
i
got
hit
last
night
fall
down
boom
woke
up
this
morning
nuh
uh
we
walked
you
home
last
night
remember
willow
sits
down
on
bed
again
you
walked
will
did
i
do
anything
weird
did
i
wave
any
shiny
things
around
shiny
things
what
are
you
talking
about
last
night
that
wasn't
me
there's
a
double
out
there
some
thing
has
stolen
my
face
and
it's
going
around
pretending
to
be
me
and
it's
hypnotizing
people
it
even
got
to
buffy
and
giles
and
riley
it's
over
there
right
now
and
they
have
no
idea
cut
to
giles'
apartment
what's
intriguing
me
is
that
there
are
any
number
of
demons
with
the
ability
to
mimic
a
simple
form
but
uh
this
sounds
like
more
than
that
hold
up
do
we
really
have
to
figure
out
what
it
is
let's
just
go
kill
it
yeah
when
the
imposter's
killed
the
body'll
probably
turn
back
into
whatever
it
really
is
and
then
we'll
know
toth
they
all
look
at
her
the
demon
with
the
creepy
stick
thing
suavexander
thoughtfully
toth
it's
gotta
be
he
hit
xander
with
that
blast
and
somehow
it
allowed
him
to
take
xander's
form
couldn't
that
be
what
the
creepy
stick
thing
did
yes
i
suppose
yes
yes
it
makes
sense
a
shapeshifting
device
giles
moves
offscreen
toward
his
bookshelves
it
does
make
sense
it
must
be
toth
cut
back
to
willow's
room
willow
and
scruffyxander
are
sitting
sidebyside
on
the
bed
he's
wringing
out
his
wet
clothing
scruffyxander
angrily
it's
a
robot
it's
an
evil
robot
constructed
from
evil
parts
that
look
like
me
designed
to
do
evil
uh
huh
or
it's
toth
scruffyxander
still
angrily
or
it's
toth
cut
back
to
giles'
i
was
gonna
look
for
toth
anyway
guess
now
i
start
looking
for
you
should
i
go
with
you
i
told
anya
to
meet
me
at
my
new
place
i'd
feel
a
whole
lot
better
knowing
she's
safe
from
this
creep
buffy
nods
go
be
with
her
i
i
mean
if
you
were
out
there
looking
for
the
double
too

buffy
looks
at
riley
then
back
at
suavexander
let's
just
say
that
i
wouldn't
wanna
run
into
you
and
kill
the
wrong
one
good
thinking
when
you
kill
this
thing
you
better
make
sure
you
got
the
one's
who's
actually
cut
back
to
willow's
a
demon
a
demon
has
taken
my
life
from
me
and
he's
living
it
better
than
i
do
he's
now
standing
and
has
his
hawaiian
shirt
in
his
hands
he
gives
it
a
shake
to
remove
the
water
willow
is
still
sitting
on
the
bed
and
winces
as
the
water
sprays
her
well
we're
working
on
it
there
has
to
be
a
way
to
get
to
buffy
to
unhypnotize
her
i'll
find
a
spell
to
snap
her
out
of
it
willow
stands
up

realizes
that
was
unhelpful
and
sometimes
you're
not
in
trouble
they
both
sit
on
the
bed
again

just
another
great
humiliation
scruffyxander
willow

like
taking
my
life

everyone's
treating
him
everyone's
treating
him

grownup

starting
to
feel
like
like
what
like
he's
doing
everything
better
he's
smarter
and

scruffyxander
shakes
head
i
don't

i
should
just
let
him
have
it
take
my
life
please
xander
no
willow
puts
hand
on
his
shoulder
you're
just
tired
and
and
all
soggy
that's
why
it
seems
so
hard
but
you
can't
let
him
just
take
your
whole
existence
why
not
it's
not
like
i
was
doing
anything
so
great

apartment
suavexander
is
getting
together
a
bottle
of
wine
and
two
glasses
anya
stands
in
the
living
room
on
a
blanket
that's
spread
on
the
floor
a
picnic
basket
is
at
her
feet
you're
lying
it's
a
trick
no
trust
me
he
walks
over
with
the
wine
and
puts
it
on
the
floor
next
to
the
basket
you
really

this
apartment
i
really
did
and
do
you
know
why
anya
looks
around
the
ceiling
fans
very
attractive

because
i
knew

all
for
you
she
moves
closer
to
him
and
they
kiss
anya
you
didn't

you
i
mean
we
didn't
talk
what
do
you
mean
i
just
got
your
phone
message
that's
all
good
they
kiss
some
more
kneel
and
then
sit
on
the
blanket
so
what
happens
next
well
at
some
point
we
take
off
our
clothes
i
mean
what
happens
next
in
our
lives
when
do
we
get
a
car
suavexander
confused
a
car
and
a
boat
no
wait
i
i
don't

a
boat
i
mean
a
puppy
or
a
child
i
have
a
list
somewhere
what
are
you
talking
about
just
we
have
to
get
going
i
don't
have
time
just
to
let
these
things
happen
there's
no
hurry
yes
there
is
there's
a
hurry
xander
i'm
dying
suavexander
looks
shocked
i
may
have
as
few
as
fifty
years
left
fifty
years
what
is
thi
oh
wait
a
minute
this
is
about
this
suavexander
touching
her
arm
sling
what
about
the
sling
you
haven't
been
hurt
like
this
since
you
became
human
suavexander
she
nods
reluctantly
maybe
it's
finally
hitting
you
what
being
human
means
anya
pouting
no
that's
not
it
yes
i
think
it
is
you
were
gonna
live
for
thousands
of
years
suavexander
anya
nods
and
now
you're
gonna
age
and
die
that
must
be
terrifying
you
don't
understand
what
it's
like
being
suddenly
human
i
think
i
can
get
what
that
would
be
like
and
we
can
get
through
it
together
you
can't
make
it
any
different
i'm
going
to
get
old
and
you
can't
promise
you'll
be
with
me
when
i'm
wrinkly
and
my
teeth
are
artificial
and
stuck
into
my
wrinkly
mouth
with
an
adhesive
no
i
can't
promise
that
but
it
doesn't
sound
terrible
and
that's
saying
something
suavexander
anya
looks
somewhat
comforted
i
promise
you
anya
very
soon
you
won't
be
thinking
about
getting
older
they
smooch
suddenly
the
door
bursts
open
and
scruffyxander
rushes
in
suavexander
and
anya
look
up
get
away
from
her
xander
anya
and
suavexander
stand
up
anya
to
suavexander
xander
suavexander
to
scruffyxander
get
out
you
don't
belong
here
anya
it's
me
anya
looks
in
confusion
from
one
to
the
other
she
starts
to
walk
toward
scruffyxander
but
suavexander
stops
her
it's
a
demon
he
stole
my
face
he's
trying
to
trick
you
anya
looks
from
one
to
the
other
very
confused
anya
you
know
i'm
me
right
no
anya
looks
at
scruffyxander
again
and
moves
closed
to
suavexander
what
is
it
make
it
go
away
cut
to
giles'
riley
is
looking
at
a
map
we
see
giles
in
the
background
looking
at
books
so
you're
thinking
we
split
up
yeah
you
check
the
places
where
he
might
try
and
go
and
blend
in
as
xander
i'll
check
the
places
where
toth
might
hang
out
the
door
bursts
open
and
willow
enters
i
swear
this
time
i
know
i
had
that
locked
buffy
toth
looks
like
xander
we
already
know
we're
on
our
way
wait
a
second
how
did
you
know
about
this
he
came
to
me
ii
mean
xander
did
and
he's
in
terrible
shape
we
need
to
help
him
shot
of
giles
reading
a
book
not
listening
to
them
he
came
to
us
too
no
we
each
had
a
xander
i
mean
you
didn't
have
a
xander
you
had
a
a
demon
in
a
xander
suit
what
makes
you
so
sure
that
yours
is
the
right
one
he
knew
stuff
he
he
did
the
snoopy
dance
willow
another
shot
of
giles
reading
buffy
it
was
xander
and
he
needs
us
oh
dear
lord
buffy
our
xander
did
he
seem
a
little
buffy
he
seemed
kind
of
forceful
and
confident
that's
not
xander
i
said
oh
dear
lord
buffy
you
always
say
that
well
it's
always
important
giles
coming
forward
to
join
them
carrying
book
neither
xander
is
a
demon
um
is
one
of
them
a
robot
what
no
um
uh
the
rod
device
it's
called
a
ferulagemina
it
splits
one
person
in
half
distilling
personality
traits
into
two
separate
bodies
as
near
as
i
can
tell
toth
was
attempting
to
split
the
slayer
into
two
different
entities
giles
hands
the
book
to
willow
two
buffys
yes
one
with
all
the
qualities
inherent
in
buffy
summers
and
the
other
one
with
everything
that
belongs
to
the
slayer
alone
the
uh
thethe
strength
the
uh
speed
the
heritage
and
when
it
hit
xander
i
think
it
separated
him
into
his
strongest
points
and
his
giles
grimaces
weakest
but
which
one's
the
real
one
they're
both
real
they're
both
xander
neither
one
of
them
is
evil
there's
nothing
in
either
of
them
that
our
xander
doesn't
already
possess
i
still
don't
get
the
original
plan
i
mean
why
do
it
the
slayer
half
would
be
like
slayer
concentrate
pretty
unkillable
but
the
two
halves
can't
exist
without
each
other
kill
the
weaker
buffy
half
and
the
slayer
half
dies
so
the
same
goes
for
the
xanders
we
lose
one
we
lose
them
both
cut
back
to
xander's
apartment
he's
the
demon
scruffyxander
anya
looks
uncertainly
at
suavexander
or
possibly
a
robot
look
at
me
look
in
my
eyes
can't
you
see
it's
me
anya
looks
from
one
to
the
other
still
completely
confused
i
i
don't
know
scruffyxander
desperately
please
look
at
him
listen
to
him
he's
all
smooth
you
have
to
know
it's
me
don't
worry
anya
i'll
get
rid
of
this
thing
i'm
thinkin'
this
is
gonna
last
about
fifteen
seconds
suavexander
walks
slowly
toward
scruffyxander
scruffyxander
reaches
inside
his
clothing
and
pulls
out
a
gun
he
points
it
at
suavexander
i'm
thinkin'
less
blackout
act
iv

fade
back
in
on
the
standoff
scruffyxander
points
the
gun
at
suavexander
with
anya
behind
suddenly
anya
rushes
forward
no
don't
shoot
him
she
pushes
the
gun
so
it
points
at
the
ceiling
suavexander
comes
forward
and
grabs
scruffyxander's
hands
and
they
all
three
grapple
for
the
gun

suavexander
gives
him
a
big
grin
anya
stares
at
them
cut
to
a
shot
of
the
two
xanders
sidebyside
now
they're
dressed
the
same
both
in
yellow
tshirts
and
identical
hawaiian
shirts
but
scruffyxander's
shirt
is
all
dirty
whereas
suavexander's
is
clean
and
scruffyxander's
hair
is
much
messier
look
and
admire
ladies
we
see
that
they're
in
the
magic
shop
willow
buffy
and
anya
are
in
a
row
staring
at
the
xanders
fascinated
in
the
background
we
see
riley
watching
and
giles
on
the
floor
making
markings
with
chalk
buffy
looking
closely
look
there's
a
scar
there
buffy
pointing
at
scruffyxander's
forehead
and
there's
the
same
one
right
there
buffy
pointing
at
suavexander's
forehead
it's
all
double
willow
pointing
this
zit
and
this
kinda
funny
dippy
thing
aand
this
weird
little
hair
that
grows
in
the
wrong
way
willow
pointing
to
scruffyxander's
nose
okay
back
off
ladies
psychologically
this
is
fascinating
doesn't
it
make
everyone
wanna
lock
them
in
separate
rooms
and
do
experiments
on
them
everyone
gives
him
an
odd
look
just
me
then
so
you
xanders
really
do
have
all
the
same
memories
all
the
same

anya
looking
downward
physical
attributes
anya
laughs
suggestively
we're
completely
identical
yeah
we
checked
out
some
stuff
in
the
car
on
the
way
over
scruffyxander
anya
frowns
in
puzzlement
fingerprints
anya
turning
to
the
others
well
maybe
we
shouldn't
do
this
reintegration
thing
right
away
see
i
can
take
the
boys
home
and
we
can
all
have
sex
together
and
you
know
just
slap
'em
back
together
in
the
morning
giles
tries
not
to
look
appalled
buffy
and
riley
grin
she's
joking
no
she's
not
she
entirely
wants
to
have
sex
with
us
together
which
is
wrong
and
and
it
would
be
very
confusing
giles
getting
up
from
the
floor
uh
uh
we
just
need
to
light
the
candles
also
we
should
continue
to
pretend
we
heard
none
of
the
disturbing
sex
talk
check
candles
and
pretense
everyone
moves
around
getting
stuff
ready
except
the
xanders
it's
not
like
it'd
be
cheating
they're
both
xander
now
hold
on
a
sec
if
you
weren't
putting
a
whammy
on
people
with
the
shiny
thing
how'd
you
do
it
how'd
you
get
the
promotion
well
i'm
good
at
that
stuff
i
am
yeah
and
hey
how
'bout
that
lady
huh
the
apartment
manager
how
weird
was
it
when
she
called
me
mister
the
xanders
grin
goofily
at
each
other
we're
ready
we
should
do
it
now
willow
the
xanders
turn
their
grins
toward
her
what'll
we
do
if
this
doesn't
work
xanders
unison
kill
us
both
spock
xanders
they
look
at
each
other
and
laugh
delightedly
they're
kinda
the
same
now
yes
he's
clearly
a
bad
influence
on
himself
hey
summon
the
goddess
chant
the
chant
let's
do
it
actually
it's
not
that
hard
your
natural
state
is
to
be
together
toth's
spell
is
doing
all
the
work
of
keeping
you
apart
i
just
have
to
break
it
so
you
two

willow
takes
them
both
and
positions
them
inside
the
chalk
markings
stand
right
here
side
by
side
we
don't
want
you
to
end
up
with
two
fronts
now
do
we
are
you
sure
you
know
how
to
do
this
willow
exhales
here
we
go
brace
yourselves
the
two
xanders
close
their
eyes
and
prepare
let
the
spell
be
ended
closeup
of
a
single
xander
still
with
eyes
closed
you
gotta
be
kidding
let
the
spell
be
ended
that's
not
gonna
work
he
opens
his
eyes
and
sees
there's
only
one
of
him
oh
willow
smiles
proudly
i
liked
it
the
other
way
put
him
back
shot
of
buffy
raising
her
eyebrows
cut
to
interior
of
xander's
basement
xander
and
riley

carrying
boxes
out
anya
is
sitting
on
a
stool
reading
a
magazine
riley
and
xander
put
the
boxes
by
the
door
and
xander
pauses
to
look
around
getting
nostalgic
i
don't
know
at
first
it's
just
a
place
then
you
start
to
make
memories
and
then
you're
like
xander
pointing
that's
where
spike
slept
and
xander
pointing
there
that's
where
anya
and
i
drowned
the
separvo
demon
oh
xander
points
and
and
right
there
that's
where
i
got
my
heart
all
ripped
out
xander
shakes
head
i
really
hate
this
place
he
and
riley
turn
to
pick
up
the
boxes
as
buffy
walks
by
she
goes
to
pick
up
another
box
passing
anya
anya
i
see
you've
joined
the
nonslingwearing
crowd
anya
smiling
yes
i'm
feeling
better
and
i
anticipate
many
years
before
my
death
excepting
disease
or
airbag
failure
that
sounds
nice
buffy
walks
off
carrying
box
xander
walks
up
to
anya
carrying
another
box
ooh
anya
tosses
magazine
aside
presents

unless
you
want
my
collection
of
babylon

commemorative
plates

a
little
me

super
strength

just
your
slave
anya
takes
box
and
goes
out
xander
watches
her
go
riley
watches
too
while
packing
a
box
how
is
it
that
she
can
always
make
me
feel
suavexander's
left
the
building
you
two
have
your
friction
but
she
digs
the
whole
package
it's
obvious
still
i
do
envy
you
sometimes
xander
riley
looks
up
at
him
i
mean
for
the
sanity
not
that
i'm
still
into
buffy
xander
quickly
not
that
i
ever
was
riley
grinning
hey
i'm
well
aware
of
how
lucky
i
am
like
lottery
lucky
buffy's
like
nobody
else
in
the
world
when
i'm
with
her
it's
like
it's
like
i'm
split
in
two
half
of
me
is
just
on
fire
going
crazy
if
i'm
not
touching
her
the
other
half
is
so
still
and
peaceful
just
perfectly
content
just
knows
this
is
the
one
riley
smiles
a
little
continues
packing
for
a
moment
then
looks
up
at
xander
again
but
she
doesn't
love
me
xander
stares
at
him
not
knowing
what
to
say
buffy
reenters
got
something
else
for
me
to
carry
uh
you
can
help
me
pack
this
sure
buffy
goes
over
to
riley
and
kisses
him
sure
they
both
turn
to
the
packing
as
xander
watches
blackout
