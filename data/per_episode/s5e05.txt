through

we
have
to
protect
the

the
two
monks

to
the
center
of
the
great
room
and
join
a
third
senior

help
me
perform
the
ritual
all
three
monks
extend
their
arms
and
begin
chanting
as
they
speak
the
ancient
words
a
tremendous
crash
echoes
through
the
monastery
and
the
massive
wooden
door
trembles
in
its
frame
as
the
junior
monks
glance
fearfully
at
the

the
ritual
resumes
and
a
breeze
springs
up
inside
the
chamber
the
relentless
pounding
on
the
door
continues
the
crossbeam
starts
to
splinter
suddenly
a
bright
flash
of
light
leaps
from
the
center
of
their
circle
then
all
goes
dark
as
the
door
finally
gives
way
and
shatters

in
on
a
sign
mounted
on
a
chain

property
no

be
prosecuted
title
card
now
buffy
flies
into
frame
and
slams
against
the
sign
she
ducks
just
as
a
vampire's
fist
smashes
into
it
where
her
head
was
an
instant
before
the
vampire
is
a
huge
burly
hell's
angel
bikertype
and
he
looms
menacingly
over
buffy
i've
always
wanted
to
kill
the
slayer
and
i've
always
wanted
piano
lessons
so
really
who's
surprised
we
have
all
this
unexpressed
rage
buffy
punctuates
her
words
with
blow
after
blow
knocking
the
hulking
vampire
back
several
feet
he
retaliates
with
a
brutal
punch
to
her
face
sending
her
reeling
she
blocks
a
second
blow
and
wrenches
the
demon's
arm
behind
his
back
and
flattens
him
against
the
fence
but
honestly
i
think
i'm
expressing
mine
better
tell
you
what
you
find
yourself
a
good
anger
management
class
the
vampire
throws
her
off
but
she
slams
him
back
into
the
fence
again
and
whips
out
a
stake
and
i'll
jam
this
pokey
wood
stick
through
your
heart
before
the
vampire
can
react
buffy
stakes
him
to
dust
and
slips
the
stake
back
into
her
coat
buffy
to
herself
i
think
that
sets
the
world
speed
record
for
closure
man
os
hey
a
bright
light
shines
in
buffy's
eyes
as
she
turns
to
see
the
factory
night
watchman
approaching
miss
if
you're
looking
for
one
of
those
rave
parties
i'm
afraid
you're
late
chased
a
bunch
of
kids
out
of
here
last
night
buffy
covers
oh
right
yeah
darn
my
fellow
ravers
will
be
so
disappointed
it
was
my
turn
to
bring
the
bundt
cake
you
know
if
it
was
my
call
i'd
let
you
do
whatever
you
want
it's
not
like
anybody's
using
this
place
or
nothin'
but
they
just
don't
pay
me
enough
to
argue
with
the
boss
so
already
gone
she
turns
to
leave
but
the
guard
stops
her
oh
hey
hold
it
miss
take
your
whatever
this
is
with
you
he
bends
over
picks
up
a
glowing
yellow
orb
and
hands
it
to
buffy
who
looks
at
it
curiously
thank
you
glow
balls
huh
night
watchman
laughs
i
swear
i
don't
get
your
generation
what
is
that
thing
buffy
distracted
i'll
let
you
know
as
soon
as
i
find
out
she
turns
and
walks
off
into
the
night

buffy
enters
and
glances
up
at
the
quaint
bell
that
rings
when
she
opens
the
door
she
strolls
into
the
store
taking
in
the
curios
and
knickknacks
lining
the
shelves
the
store
is
quiet
and
empty
she
looks
up
to
find
giles
standing
serenely
in
the
center
of
the
store
dressed
in
a
spangled
purple
robe
and
pointed
purple
warlock's
cap
giles
smiles
at
buffy
cheerily
who
merely
stares
him
down
finally
he
drops
the
facade
and
shrugs
out
of
the
costume
just
as
dawn
bursts
through
the
door
behind
buffy
gasping
for
breath
dawn
to
buffy
i
told
you
you
couldn't
ditch
me

a
good
thing
you
all
right
you
seem
a
little
distracted

is
getting
medical
attention

a
voice
echoes
in
the
cavernous
chamber
speaking
in
czech
god
help
me
pan
down
to
reveal
the
monk
from
the
czech
monastery
crouched
on
the
floor
amid
a
circle
of
lit
candles
and
magickal
icons
similar
to
the
one
we
saw
before
he's
marking
locations
on
a
map
of
sunnydale
suddenly
a
deep
boom
reverberates
through
the
factory
and
he
looks
up
fearfully
at
the
tempered
steel
door
the
massive
portal
shudders
as
it's
struck
by
some
titanic
force
from
outside
the
beast
the
pounding
continues
and
the
steel
buckles
inward
with
each
blow
the
door
suddenly
flies
into
the
room
taking
a
good
portion
of
the
surrounding
wall
with
it
when
the
dust
settles
glory
an
attractive
blond
woman
in
a
formfitting
red
dress
stands
incongruously
amid
the
rubble
she
strides
into
the
room
and
smiles
manically
at

releases
him
it's
okay

a
new
kind
of
nasty
any
suspects

got
the
list
narrowed
down
to
just
under

willow
carries
the
hourglass
over
to
anya
the

hanging
off
it
does
this
look
right
to
you

be
this
french
sorcerer
back
in
the
16th
idon'tknowwhat

the
curtain
back

spells
well
all
spells
leave
a
trace
signature
it's
just
not
perceptible
to
the
human
eye
in
this
case
it
could
be
the
image
of
a
hand
choking
your
mother
or
a
cloud
of
mist
around
her
or
maybe
the
shape
of
the
demon
that's
performing
the
spell

called
the
dagon
sphere
and
it
has
a
history
going
back
many
centuries
what's
it
do
it's
a
protective
device
used
to
ward
off
ancient
primordial
evil
any
word
on
what
this
evil
looks
like
unfortunately
no
this
is
where
giles
to
customer
excuse
me
giles
to
buffy
this
is
where
accounts
get
vague
all
we've
managed
to
uncover
so
far
is
the
dagon
sphere
was
created
to
repel
that
which
cannot
be
named
i'm
going
to
go
back
to
the
factory
where
i
found
it
whoever
planted
this
doohickey's
got
answers
buffy
you've
heard
me
say
this
before
but
do
be
careful
anything
that
goes
unnamed
is
usually
an
object
of
deep
worship
or
great
fear
maybe
both
have
you
completed
the
trance
seen
what's
harming
your
mother
that's
the
thing
i
just
saw
buffy
breaks
off
when
she
senses
dawn
standing
behind
her
yes
nothing
it
didn't
work
she
drops
the
phone
in
its
cradle
and
faces
dawn
what
are
you
talking
about
slayer
stuff
i'm
going
out
buffy
heads
for
the
door
do
you
really
think
i
care
you're
the
slayer
buffy
stops
and
turns
to
her
what's
that
supposed
to
mean
dawn
gives
her
a
cold
look
i'll
be
home
in

buffy
walks
down

something
she
reaches
behind
a
tree
and
yanks

out
into

hi

out
for
a
walk
at
night
by
my
house
no

selfinvolved
worldview
your
house
happens
to
be
directly
between

and
other
parts
of
this

sees
the

semiconscious

crazy
buffy
presses
the
attack
hitting
and
kicking
for
all
she's
worth
forcing

her
blows
seem
more
to

swings
her
around
