riley
sitting
on
willow's
bed
i
guess
we
have
to
talk
buffy
sitting
on
her
bed
i
guess
we
do
they
sit
silently
looking
mainly
at
the
floor
only
throwing
occasional
glances
at
each
other
somebody
should
speak
before
one
of
us
graduates
riley
gets
up
with
a
sigh
after
a
little
more
time
what
are
you
capricorn
on
the
cusp
of
aquarius
you
sorry
that
came
out
a
little
blunter
than
i
intended
it's
just
you
are
amazing
your
speed
your
strength
also
passionate
artistic
and
inquisitive
who
are
you
you
know
who
i
am
the
rest
what
i
do
riley
shakes
his
head
i
can't
tell
you
buffy
gets
up
well
then
let
me
you're
part
of
some
military
monster
squad
that
captures
demons
vampires
probably
have
some
official
sounding
euphemisms
for
them
like
unfriendlies
or
–
nonsapiens
riley
nods
hostile
sub
terrestrials
so
you
deliver
these
–
hsts
to
a
bunch
of
lab
coats
who
perform
experiments
on
them
which
among
other
things
turn
some
into
harmless
little
bunnies
how
am
i
doing
so
far
a
little
too
well
meanwhile
by
day
you
pretend
to
be
riley
finn
cornfed
iowa
boy
riley
looks
down
ever
been
to
iowa
riley
god
if
that's
even
your
name
it
is
born
and
raised
and
hey
bulletin
i'm
not
the
only
one
who's
been
a
little
less
than
honest
here
buffy
sits
back
down
i
thought
a
professional
demon
chaser
like
yourself
would
have
figured
it
out
by
now
i'm
the
slayer
riley
just
looks
at
her
slayer
chosen
one
riley
is
still
lost
she
who
hangs
out
a
lot
in
cemeteries
you're
kidding
buffy
gets
back
up
ask
around
look
it
up
slayer
comma
the
and
you
fight
demons
i
mean
you
waled
on
those
guys
you
did
pretty
well
yourself
but
i'm
a
walking
bruise
today
you
see
me
with
my
clothes
off
i
look
like
buffy
raises
her
eyebrows
at
him
i
mean
i
have
–
bruises
i
don't
see
a
scratch
on
you
you're
not
looking
hard
enough
i'm
looking
pretty
hard
buffy
takes
a
deep
breath
both
of
them
look
away
so
then
what
do
we
do
i
don't
know
i
just
buffy
sighs
i
really
thought
that
you
were
a
nice
normal
guy
i
am
a
nice
normal
guy
maybe
by
this
town's
standards
but
i'm
not
grading
on
a
curve
riley
shifts
and
swallows
i
think
we
both
need
a
little
time
to
–
process
everything
buffy
takes
a
deep
breath
maybe
then
yeah
yeah
i
think
that's
a
good
idea
they
look
at
each
other
for
a
while
then
riley
starts
to
leave
riley
turns
back
oh
i
don't
think
i
need
to
tell
you
buffy
sitting
on
her
bed
with
her
arms
crossed
i
won't
say
a
word
good
it'll
be
safer
for
all
he
trails
off
and
looks
over
at
amyrat
who's
squeaking
like
crazy
in
her
cage
shortly
thereafter
the
whole
room
begins
to
shake
riley
points
at
the
open
closet
door
over
here
they
hurry
and
stand
in
the
door
frame
until
the
earth
stops
shaking
wow
that
was
some
ride
buffy
walks
out
into
the
room
looking
spooked
sorry
i'm
so
excited
this
is
my
first
earthquake
it's
not
mine
intro

cut
to
spike
pulling
the
big
red
leather
chair
in
xander's
basement
to
one
side
of
the
water
leaking
from
a
pipe
in
the
ceiling
sodden
sleeping
chair
is
bloody
–
sodden
xander
sets
a
pan
underneath
to
catch
the
water
the
quake
just
knocked
a
couple
of
pipes
lose
there
is
a
wrench
hanging
up
over
there
by
the
workbench
try
tightening
the
coupling
do
i
look
like
a
plumber
to
you
no
you
look
like
a
big
mooch
that
doesn't
lift
a
finger
around
here
but
i
have
to
get
to
work

delivering
melted
cheese
on
bread
doing
your
part

pal
xander
picks
up
the
wrench
and
hands
it
to
spike

xander
turns
away
spike
takes
the
wrench
when
you're
done
fixing
that
leak
xander
spike
hauls
back
the
wrench
but
is
stopped
from
hitting
xander
by
the
intense
pain
in
his
head
try
cleaning
up
this
mess
and
doing
a
little
laundry
for
once
wouldn't
kill
you
xander
turns
back
to
see
spike
holding
his
head
groaning
with
the
pain
unfortunately
cut
to
buffy
getting
ready
to
leave
her
dorm
room
just
as
willow
comes
in
hey
i
was
in
the
library
during
the
quake
almost
got
buried
under
some
19th
century
literature
and
i
don't
have
to
tell
you
how
hard
it
is
to
dig
through
some
of
that
stuff
you
okay
yeah
a
couple
of
broken
knickknacks
but
no
biggies
well
porter
dorm
is
completely
blacked
out
so
naturally
they
are
dealing
with
the
crisis
the
only
way
they
know
how
'aftershock
party'
ah
this
from
the
dorm
that
brought
us
the
‘somebody
sneezed'
party
and
the
‘day
that
ends
in
y'
party
they
do
seem
to
be
pretty
generous
with
the
milestones
hey
you
should
ask
riley
to
come
much
carousing
by
flattering
candlelight
ah
riley
is
–
ahm
busy
i'm
pretty
sure
but
you
know
you
go
on
ahead
and
i'll
catch
up
with
you
there
i'm
on
my
way
for
a
little
giles
oneonone
anything
wrong
wrong
no
mmmm
not
at
all
cut
to
giles
sitting
at
the
table
in
his
courtyard
buffy
pacing
something
horrible
is
going
to
happen
giles
it
was
an
earthquake
buffy
a
not
uncommon
occurrence
in
southern
california
no
reason
to
think
it
was
anything
more
oh
i
so
have
a
reason
a
darn
good
reason
the
last
time
we
had
an
earthquake
i
died
yes
i
know
that
and
therefore
i
completely
understand
your
anxiety
oh
good
because
i'd
hate
for
my
little
untimely
horrible
death
concern
to
be
ambiguous
but
unless
evidence
suggests
otherwise
i
think
that
we
can
assume
that
it's
shifting
landmasses
and
not
a
portent
of
some
imminent
doom
giles
lifts
up
a
map
of
sunnydale
on
a
board
with
red
pins
stuck
on
it
in
clusters
now
in
the
meantime
i've
got
a
few
theories
about
our
mysterious
commando
friends
buffy
sits
down
oh
really
now
based
on
the
locations
of
our
various
sightings
and
spike's
reluctant
description
of
their
underground
installation
buffy
jumps
up
what
if
the
quake
was
a
sign
ah
a
bad
omen
and
we
just
ignore
it
there
is
going
to
be
a
lot
of
red
faces
when
the
world
comes
to
an
end
giles
gets
up
buffy
if
the
quake
heralds
some
such
catastrophe
i'm
sure
there
will
be
other
signs
to
follow
which
will
afford
us
plenty
of
time
to
avert
it
now
i
believe
that
the
commando
installation
is
either
very
close
to
or
directly
underneath
your
school
now
if
that
is
the
case
i'm
convinced
that
one
or
more
of
them
may
be
in
your
very
midst
plague
what
what
if
the
end
of
the
world
is
coming
in
the
form
of
a
plague
then
too
many
people
may
be
infected
by
the
time
we
actually
buffy
will
you
stop
worrying
about
what
may
be
and
concentrate
on
what
is
buffy
gets
ready
to
say
something
he
stops
her
with
a
gesture
vigilance
is
all
very
good
but
as
we
are
getting
close
the
is
a
much
more
pressing
question
cut
to
riley
and
forrest
walking
down
a
white
walled
corridor
in
fatigues
what's
a
slayer
slayer
thrash
band
anvil
handed
guitar
band
with
delusions
of
black
sabbath
no
a
girl
with
powers
oh
the
slayer
oh
yeah
i've
heard
of
the
slayer
fill
me
in
well
the
way
i
got
it
figured
the
slayer
is
like
some
kind
of
boogeyman
for
the
subterrestrials
something
they
tell
their
little
spawn
to
make
them
eat
their
vegetables
and
clean
up
their
slime
pits
you're
telling
me
she
doesn't
exist
oh
wait
a
sec
am
i
bursting
somebody's
bubble
here
maybe
this
is
a
bad
time
to
tell
you
about
–
the

forrest
laughs
sorry
sorry
it's
a
myth
rye
all
part

that
medieval

up
to
explain
things
we
deal
with
every
day
a
labcoat
and
another
guy
are
leading
down
a
horned
demon
how
do
you
explain
the
things
we
deal
with
forrest
they're
just
animals
man
plain
and
simple
granted
they're
a
little
rarer
than
the
one's
you
grew
up
with
on
that
little
farm
in
smallville
there
is
a
commotion
behind
them
the
horned
demon
has
broken
loose
they
run
to
help
subdue
it
forrest
with
the
demons
arm
around
his
neck
where
is

hypo
the

is
fumbling
to
get
his
syringe
filled
drops
the
container
riley
grabs
the
nightstick
the
other
guy
dropped
and
hits
the
demon
over
the
head
knocking
it
out

holding
his
throat
and
gasping
for

a
topless
guy
trailing
two
girls
makes
his
way
across
the
room
and
walks
through
a
door
as
the
door
swings
shut
behind
them
we
see
the
green
clawed
fingers
of
a
demon
gripping
the
edge
cut
to
the
same
guy
alone
in
a
room
fixing
four
drinks

guy
yells
over
towards
the
next
room

he
picks
up
the
four
drinks
and
turns
around
an
ugly
green
demon
roars
and
slices
him
across
the
throat
with
its
claws
we
see
the
drinks
drop
to
the
floor
blood
drips
on
them
cut
to
willow
at
the
party

the
two
of
them
sitting
on
a
couch
their
backs
to
her
i

walks
away
looking
unhappy
as
they
kiss
cut
to
willow
opening
the
door
to
a
dark
room
hello
anyone
in
here
she
closes
the
door
behind
her
and
walks
further
into
the
room
she
stumbles
against
something
and
reaches
down
to
feel
what
it
was
then
lays
down
on
the
bed
suddenly
the
lights
come
back
on
and
we
see
that
the
guy
with
the
sliced
throat
is
laying
on
the
other
side
of
her
willow
slowly
turns
and
jumps
off
the
bed
panting
with
fear
she
stares
at
the
symbol
of
a
pyramid
with
an
eye
in
it
that
has
been
carved
into
his
chest
cut
to
xander
walking
down
into
his
basement
carrying
a
pizza
box

spike
wearing
one
of
xander's
kneelength

out

looks
after
xander
at
a
loss
for
words
cut
to
the
dead
guy
being
wheeled
away
in
a
body
bag
as
buffy
walks
in
willow
sitting
on
some
stairs
buffy
over
here
buffy
goes
to
sit
next
to
her
with
a
sigh
wow

demon
tracking
buffy
as
they
walk
out

he
even
go
here
cut
to
riley

in
their
dorm
room

the
third
member
of
their
team
comes
in
the
ball

the
head

him
wanted
to
drain
the
blood
out
of
him
so
i'm
thinking
the
whatever
took
a
bunch
of
the
guy's
blood
with
it
and
i
haven't
been
a
nerd
for
a
very
long
time
hello
dating
a
guitarist
or
i
was
tell
me
about
this
symbol
willow
takes
out
a
yellow
napkin
and
unfolds
it
right
it
was
carved
into
his
chest
like
a
big
creepy
eye
xander
looks
at
her
drawing
it's
kind
of
the
cbs
logo
hey
could
this
be
the
handiwork
of
one
mr
morley
safer
i'm
telling
you
i've
seen
this
somewhere
before
i
just
can't
remember
where
i
mean
it's
like
it's
the
end
of
the
world
again
it's
ah
the
earthquake
that
symbol
yes
i
told
you
ii
said
end
of
the
world
and
you're
like
poopoo
southern
california
poopoo
i'm
so
very
sorry
my
contrition
completely
dwarfs
the
impending
apocalypse
no
iit
can't
be
we've
done
this
already
it's
the
end
of
the
world
everyone
dies
it's
rather
important
really
so
what
do
we
do
buffy
goes
and
picks
up
a
crossbow
i
stop
it
everyone
looks
down
on
the
symbol
on
the
napkin
which
blends
into
the
same
symbol
on
the
side
of
a
crypt
i
wonder
where
i've
seen
this
before
where
else
the
place
i
spend
most
of
my
waking
hours
memorizing
stuff
of
the
sides
of
mausoleums
big
freaky
cereal
boxes
of
death
there
is
a
noise
of
stone
scraping
cut
to
the
green
demon
picking
up
the
bones
of
a
child's
skeleton
and
putting
them
into
a
burlap
sack
door
was
open
demon
turns
and
roars
at
her
she
shoots
it
in
the
shoulder
with
the
crossbow
then
throws
the
crossbow
at
it
it
bats
the
crossbow
aside
and
comes
at
her
the
two
of
them
start
fighting
after
a
while
the
fight
moves
outside
at
the
end
the
demon
picks
buffy
up
and
slams
her
down
on
top
of
a
grave
marker
buffy
lies
on
the
ground
groaning
for
a
moment
but
when
a
shadow
falls
over
her
she
flips
back
to
her
feet
turns
and
hauls
back
with
a
hard
right
at
–
riley
who
just
manages
to
block
it
wow
that
flippything
you
did
buffy
looks
around
where
did
it
go
i
saw
it
take
off
towards
the
woods
and
you
didn't
follow
it
no
weapons
no
backup
you
don't
go
after
a
demon
that
size
by
yourself
i
do
riley
pulls
out
a
handheld
radio
yeah
well
i'm
no
slayer
riley
to
radio
base
one
this
is
lilac
one
lilac
riley
holds
up
a
hand
to
quiet
her
confirmed
sighting
of
an
unidentified
subt
mobilize
patrol
team
for
debriefing
at
o800
hours
copy
that
very
commandory
–
lilac
not
withstanding
riley
laughs
putting
his
radio
away
what
are
you
doing
here
looking
for
you
she
who
hangs
out
in
cemeteries
buffy
frowns
and
turns
away
i
have
to
–
get
the
demon
don't
sweat
it
we'll
bag
it
buffy
turns
back
it's
not
that
simple
yeah
but
i
really
think
riley
i
just
can't
can't
talk
can't
any
of
it
i
can't
be
with
you
it's
just
a
huge
black
pit
of
a
mistake
and
i
can't
go
there
again
again
you've
dated
me
before
no
look
i
was
involved
buffy
sighs
you
don't
know
what
my
life
is
like
but
i'm
dying
to
find
out
dying
being
the
operative
word
here
okay
there
is
too
much
risk
there
is
too
much
buffy
sighs
it's
just
doomed
and
i
can't
do
doomed
again
right
now
sorry
ii
don't
understand
where
this
is
coming
from
i
know
you
like
me
and
it's
not
like
we
don't
have
anything
in
common
but
that's
not
enough
buffy
i'm
thrown
by
this
i'm
confused
but
i
can
feel
my
skin
humming
my
hands
my
every
inch
of
me
i've
never
been
this
excited
about
anybody
before
i'm
not
trying
to
scare
you
and
i'm
not
going
to
force
myself
on
you
but
i'm
by
god
not
going
to
walk
away
because
i
think
it
might
not
work
i
don't
know
what's
happened
in
your
past
buffy
backs
up
a
step
pain
death
apocalypse
none
of
it
fun
–
do
you
know
what
a
hellmouth
is
do
you
have
a
fancy
term
for
it
because
i
went
to
high
school
on
it
for
three
years
buffy
shakes
her
head
we
do
not
have
that
much
in
common
this
is
a
job
to
you
it's
not
just
a
job
it's
an
adventure
great
but
for
me
it's
destiny
it
is
something
that
i
can't
change
something
that
i
can't
escape
i'm
stuck
you
don't
have
to
be
you're
not
in
high
school
anymore
you
can
change
things
riley
no
i
know
it
may
seem
riley
my
answer
is
no
she
turns
and
walks
away
and
he
watches
her
go
before
turning
and
leaving
himself
cut
to
the
gang
researching
at
giles
a
vahrall
demon
willow
looking
over
at
his
book
eew
i
second
that
revulsion
yes
‘slick
like
gold
and
gird
in
moonlight
father
of
portents
and
brother
to
blight'
buffy
reading
over
his
shoulder
limbs
with
talons
eyes
like
knives
bane
to
the
blameless
thief
of
lives
cut
to
riley
debriefing
his
patrol
team
three
meters
tall
approximately
100
–120
kilograms
based
on
my
visual
analysis
special
hazards
unknown
probably
nothing
we
haven't
handled
before
there
is
no
pattern
we
can
discern
yet
so
we
got
to
assume
that
it
is
on
a
basic
killcrushdestroy
cut
to
buffy
this
thing
isn't
digging
up
the
bones
of
a
child
for
fun
well
a
demon's
got
some
pretty
hilarious
ideas
about
fun
bones
of
a
child
though
i
saw
that
willow
pulls
a
book
over
to
her
and
flips
pages
an
ancient
ritual
–
uses
the
blood
of
a
man
the
bones
of
a
child
and
–
something
called
the
word
of
valios
iit's
all
part
of
the
sacrifice
–
the
sacrifice
of
three
let
me
guess
–
ends
the
world
well
yeah
iit's
not
big
with
the
details
though
it
doesn't
say
how
the
world
ends
or
what
the
ritual
entails
exactly
the
sacrifice
of
three
–
three
people
are
going
to
die
no
they
won't
because
claw
boy
is
not
getting
all
of
his
ingredients
we
have
to
find
that
third
one
the
word
of
valios
keep
him
from
getting
it
if
he
doesn't
already
have
it
i
mean
who
knows
where
he's
been
cut
to
riley
here
is
one
for
the
good
guys
this
thing
has
a
pheromone
signature
a
mile
wide
agent
gates
has
been
working
with
the
detection
system
the
lab's
developing
forrest
gets
up
can't
tell
where
it's
going
but
i've
got
a
bead
on
where
it's
been
forrest
stands
next
to
riley
residual
traces
showing
up
in
populated
areas
the
thing's
not
shy
we're
going
out
in
civies
day
clothes
only
guys
weapons
stowed
in
packs
keep
‘em
out
of
sight
til
nightfall
remember
this
isn't
a
capture
it's
a
kill
forrest
as
the
meeting
breaks
up
get
your
quadrant
assignment
from
me
we'll
blanket
the
town
cut
to
buffy
i'll
check
the
magic
shop
see
if
they've
heard
of
a
book
called
the
word
of
valios
buffy
puts
on
her
coat
willow
xander
how
about
the
book
archives
at
the
museum
we'll
stop
at
my
place
on
the
way
get
some
weapons
and
i'll
change
into
something
that
isn't
quite
as
anchovy
scented
you
guys
this
thing
takes
wicked
very
seriously
be
careful
i
couldn't
stand
anybody
getting
hurt
cut
to
a
stake
clamped
to
the
edge
of
a
table
camera
pans
up
to
reveal
spike
standing
on
a
chair
before
it
his
arms
spread
wide
goodbye
dru
see
you
in
hell
he
lets
himself
fall
forward
just
as
willow
and
xander
walk
in
he
turns
in
the
air
to
look
at
them
and
misses
the
stake
smashing
the
table
what
are
you
doing
spike
picks
himself
up
bloody
rot
can't
a
person
knock
what
were
you
doing
you
were
trying
to
stake
yourself
fag
off
it's
no
concern
of
yours
is
too
for
one
thing
that's
my
shirt
you're
about
to
dust
for
another
we've
shared
a
lot
here
you
should
have
trusted
me
enough
to
do
it
for
you
xander
what
he
wants
to
die
i
want
to
help
it's
okay
we
know
him
we
can't
just
let
him
poof
himself
oh
but
you
can
you
know
i'd
drain
you
drier
than
the
sahara
if
i
had
half
a
chance
and
besides
i'm
beyond
pathetic
stuck
in
this
basement
washing
skivvies
for
a
blighter
i
wouldn't
have
bothered
to
bite
a
few
months
ago
xander
in
the
process
of
changing
hey
i
mean
am
i
even
remotely
scary
anymore
tell
me
the
truth
willow
just
looks
at
him
and
he
jumps
at
her
curling
his
hands
into
claws
well
the
shirt
is
kinda
–
not
very
threatening
–
and
the
short
pants
but
you
know
it
could
also
be
because
i
know
you
can't
bite
which
i
guess
isn't
really
what
you
need
to
hear
right
now
is
it
stop
please
just
clear
out
fine
but
you
break
anything
else
while
we're
gone
and
you'll
be
sleeping
in
the
garage
buster
we
can't
leave
him
here
like
this
we'll
have
to
take
him
with
us
to
the
museum
oh
you
go
on
i
won't
do
anything
i
feel
better
now
promise
xander
puts
an
arm
around
spike's
shoulder
as
they
walk
towards
the
steps
think
of
the
happy
if
we
don't
find
what
we're
looking
for
we
face
an
apocalypse
really
you're
not
just
saying
that
cut
to
buffy
walking
down
the
street
she
sees
riley
slowly
walking
down
the
street
looking
at
a
little
handheld
device
and
waits
for
him
to
get
to
her
buffy
is
this
really
the
time
for
donkey
kong
riley
frowns
confused
what
buffy
looks
at
the
thing
in
his
hand
oh
it
ah
takes
trace
readings
of
creatures
pheromones
and
and
it's
either
mating
season
for
this
thing
or
it's
moving
all
over
town
you
know
buffy
actually
i
need
to
go
big
bad
needs
to
be
squished
riley
falls
in
beside
her
right
i'm
on
it
too
riley
steps
in
front
of
her
it's
just
this
thing
this
you
and
me
thing
it's
stupid
i
know
which
is
why
we
can't
do
it
the
you
and
me
thing
no
i
mean
you're
stupid
riley
buffy
looks
at
him
i
mean
–
i
don't
mean
that
–
no
i
think
maybe
i
do
wow
with
sweet
talk
like
that
you'll
definitely
melt
my
reservations
i'm
serious
you
have
this
twisted
way
of
looking
at
things
this
doom
and
gloom
mentality
you
keep
thinking
like
that
and
things
will
probably
turn
out
just
the
way
you
expect
buffy
starts
to
walk
past
him
you
know
there
is
nothing
more
dangerous
than
a
psychgradstudent
riley
follows
and
steps
back
in
front
of
her
buffy
where
is
the
bad
here
buffy
sighs
and
rubs
her
neck
it
just
turns
out
–
we
are
even
more
wellmatched
than
we
thought
we
were
i
mean
you're
a
riley
sees
some
people
walking
by
–
fry
cook
–
and
so
am
i
yeah
but
you're
an
amateur
–
fry
cook
and
i
come
form
a
long
line
of
fry
cooks
that
don't
live
past
25
which
is
exactly
the
attitude
i'm
talking
about
look
i
know
the
risks
of
what
we
do
i
also
know
it's
more
rewarding
than
any
other
job
on
the
planet
–
and
fun
fun
the
last
person
i
know
that
believed
that
is
in
a
coma
right
now
because
she
had
so
much
fun
on
the
job
i'm
not
saying
that
you
shouldn't
take
your
work
seriously
that
i
should
just
turn
my
frown
upside
down
is
that
it
i
wish
i
could
but
this
isn't
the
kind
of
gig
where
you
can
just
hang
it
up
at
the
end
of
the
night
and
snuggle
with
your
honey
but
why
why
can't
it
be
because
i've
tried
it
okay
and
every
time
it
just
fell
apart
and
then
i
get
sucked
right
back
in
to
the
uberevil
welcome
to
the
story
of
the
world
things
fall
apart
buffy
and
evil
–
it
comes
and
goes
but
the
way
people
manage
is
they
don't
do
it
alone
they
pull
each
other
through
if
you
weren't
so
selfinvolved
you'd
see
that
buffy
after
a
beat
you
have
no
idea
what
you're
talking
about
you
barely
know
me
she
walks
past
him
and
he
stays
beside
her
i
know
that
it's
not
just
a
job
thing
i'm
sure
that
there
is
some
goodlooking
guy
that
done
you
wrong
in
there
too
but
mostly
i
think
you
want
to
stay
down
in
that
dark
place
riley
buffy
stops
to
look
at
him
and
he
steps
in
front
of
her
because
maybe
it's
safer
down
there
you
are
so
out
of
line
no
see
i
don't
think
so
riley
puts
his
hands
on
her
arms
look
we
have
an
opportunity
here
you
and
me
and
the
fact
that
you're
too
scared
to
even
give
it
a
try
is
my
business
so
why
don't
you
just
leave
me
alone
riley
straightens
up
slowly
and
looks
at
her
fair
enough
after
another
moment
he
walks
past
her
buffy
closes
her
eyes
for
a
moment
then
walks
on
herself
cut
to
willow
xander
and
spike
in
front
of
the
historical
museum
of
sunnydale
great
no
word
of
valios
not
even
a
syllable
of
valios
which
means
i'm
one
step
closer
to
melting
in
a
sea
of
molten
hellfire
yeah
you
shouldn't
talk
like
that
yeah
okay
so
you
can't
kill
anymore
but
there
are
other
fun
things
you
can
do
you'll
adjust
spike
stops
and
turns
around
adjust
and
what
end
up
like
the
two
of
you
no
thank
you
here
it
goes
‘we
can't
jus
leave
him
here
to
stake
himself
it's
not
right'
i
should
think
you
would
be
glad
to
greet
the
end
of
days
i
mean
neither
one
of
you
is
making
much
of
a
go
at
it
spike
gestures
at
xander
you
kids
your
age
are
going
off
to
university
you've
made
it
as
far
as
the
basement
and
red
here
you
couldn't
even
keep
dogboy
happy
you
can
take
the
loser
out
of
high
school
but
i
see
what
you're
doing
you're
trying
to
get
us
to
dust
you
am
not
i
just
don't
want
pity
from
geeks
more
useless
than
i
am
we're
not
useless
we
–
we
help
people
we
fight
the
forces
of
evil
buffy
fights
the
forces
of
evil
you're
her
groupies
she'd
do
just
as
well
without
you
–
better
i'd
wager
since
she
wouldn't
have
to
go
about
saving
your
hides
all
the
time
that
is
no
not
true
we're
part
of
the
team
she
needs
us
or
you're
just
the
same
tenth
grade
losers
you've
always
been
and
she's
too
much
of
a
softy
to
cut
you
lose
willow
and
xander
stand
there
speechless
and
after
a
moment
spike
turns
and
walks
on
a
satisfied
grin
spreading
over
his
face
cut
to
giles
looking
through
a
book
he
finds
a
picture
of
the
word
of
valios
which
turns
out
to
be
a
15th
century
talisman
oh
–
as
usual
–
dear
goes
to
dig
through
his
chest
pulls
out
a
box
filled
with
necklaces
and
talismans
and
pulls
out

buffy
walking

giles
house
what
happened
giles
looking
beat
up
is
sitting
on
the
couch
next
to
xander
it's
my
fault
i
should
have
known
giles
the
word
of
valios
–
is
the
name
of
a
talisman
–
not
a
book
i
blame
myself
entirely
i
had
it
here
you
had
it
here
okay
first
i
thought
you
were
being
too
hard
on
yourself
but
willow
brings
some
ice
wrapped
into
a
dishtowel
and
giles
presses
it
against
his
head
oh
thank
you
i
bought
it
at
a
sorcerer's
estate
sale
i
really
only
glanced
at
it
once
i
thought
it
was
a
knock
off
well
they
have
it
and
they
probably
have
their
sacrifices
by
now
too
they're
on
their
way
to
perform
the
sacrifice
now
on
their
way
where
you
found

for
the
hellmouth
they
are
going
to
open
the
hellmouth
the
one
in
the

me

he
even
here
it's
not
like
he
can
fight
if
we
leave
him
alone
he'll
stake
himself
and
that's
bad
because
fine
whatever
just
keep
him
out
of
the
way
i
do
not
have
time
for
this
buffy
sighs

a
look
out

there
is
no
pain
no
pain

the
demon
again
i
can
hurt
a
demon

out
and
starts
to
make
up
for
all
the
violence
he's
missed
out
on
having
a
great
old
time
spike
as
the
demon
finally
drops

a
bloody
animal

spike
picks
up
the
vahrall
not
noticing
that
it

just
gathered
up
the
sack
of
bones
and
lifts
it
high
above
his
head
no
spike

in
the
hole

throws
the
vahrall
into
the
hellmouth

the
earth

out
of
here
the
building
is
going
to
come
down
starting
with
a
beam

to
the
ground

runs
over
and
helps
him
up

continues
to
beat
up
on
the
last
vahrall
demon
she
even
picks
up
a
piece
of
wood
and
stakes
it
at
one
point
but
to
little
effect
as
the
vahrall
hauls
back
to
hit
buffy
its
arm
is
grabbed
from
behind
by
riley
who
pulls
it
around
and
starts
to
beat
up
on
it
buffy
still
on
the
floor

it
jump
into
the
hellmouth

vahrall
grabs
riley
and
throws
him
across
the
room

to
get
dropped
by
a
hard
kick
to
his
stomach
buffy
is
back
up
and
waling
on
the
demon
riley
gets
back
up
and
the
beat
up
on
it
in
tandem
for
a
moment
before
buffy
kicks
it
across
the
room
a
beam
drops
on
riley
and
while
buffy
is
distracted
the
vahrall
picks
up
the
talisman
and
slides
headfirst
into
the
hellmouth
i'm
going
in

hooks
a
cable
to
her
belt
you're
coming

buffy
runs
and
dives
into
the
hellmouth
we
get
a
shot
of
the
demon
falling
a
shot
of
riley
and
the
cable
being
pulled
from
a
round
box
on
his
belt
a
shot
of

shot
of

wrapping
the
cable
around
a
piece
of
rebar
sticking
out
of
some
broken
concrete
the
cable
stops
being
pulled
out
and
riley
starts
to
pull
buffy
back
up
while
the
earth
is
shaking
again
buffy's
arm
hooks
over
the
edge
of
the
hole
and
riley
hurries
forward
and
helps
her
climb
out
of
the
hole

is
holding
on
to
the
demon
with
her
left
hand

helps
her
to
pull
it
out
of
the
hellmouth
buffy
the
vahrall
demon
slumps
down
dead
and
the
earth
stops
shaking
