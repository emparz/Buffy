gets
up

willow
away
as

falls
to
the
ground
again
the
vampire
goes
to
where
giles
and

are
still
standing
by
the
crypt
and
shoves
them
up
against
it
with
one
hand
on
each
of
their
chests
they
stare
at
her
in
alarm
willow
runs
up
behind
the
vampire
and
stakes
her
the
guys
gasp
and
pant
as
willow
begins
to
grin
my
god
what
a
rough
night
willow
giggling
grabbing
at
xander
i
just
did
two
of
'em
yay
on
me
willow
giggles
in
exhilaration
xander
grins
the
guys
come
on
either
side
of
willow
and
they
begin
to
walk
off
that
was
pretty
cool
except
the
part
where
i
was
all
terrified
and
and
now
my
knees
are
all
dizzy
giles
stops
them
as
he
spots
something
on
the
ground
and
bends
over
to
pick
it
up
it
turns
out
to
be
his
glasses
not
so
much
a
big
success
night
for
me
xander
they
resume
walking
as
giles
begins
cleaning
his
glasses
on
his
shirt
but
i
think
i
should
get
points
just
for
showing
up
unlike
some
riley
finn
who
shall
remain
unnamed
yes
that
was
disappointing
things
would
have
been
easier
if
he'd
been
here
giles
puts
glasses
on
oh
piffle
who
needs
him
when
i'm
dusting
two
at
a
ti
willow
she
suddenly
staggers
and
they
catch
her
each
grabbing
an
arm
whoops
willow
smiles
nervously
at
xander
maybe
it
would've
been
good
if
he'd
shown
up
perhaps
he
forgot

hmm
let's
see
shot
of
the
starry
sky
one
of
the
stars
suddenly
enlarges
and
streaks
toward
the
earth
trailing
a
golden
tail
a
huge
flaming
meteor
about
to
crash
into
something
they
scramble
to
their
feet
as
the
thing
flies
past
them
and
lands
somewhere
in
the
distance
a
burst
of
light
momentarily
flashes
from
behind
trees
cut
to
darkness
bits
of
flaming
rubble
slowly
appear
as
we
see
from
the
perspective
of
something
digging
its
way
out
of
something
the
camera
moves
jerkily
as
the
something
looks
around
finds
itself
in
a
trench
carved
by
the
passage
of
the
meteor
our
perspective
rises
as
we
climb
up
out
of
the
trench
and
find
rocky
earth
surrounded
by
trees
in
the
distance
we
see
the
security

no

gestures
ii

it
be
better
for
her
to
rest
someplace
where
she
felt
safe
and
comfortable
even
if
it
would
mean
some
work
for

taking

sitting
in
the
hallway
reading
her
book
shot
of
her
from
overhead
in
the
alien
creature's
point
of
view
shot
of
dawn
reading
as
we
see
the
creature
crawling
along
the
ceiling
above
her
head
cut
to
willow
and
tara
walking
through
forest
night
then
we
see
riley
xander
anya
and
giles
walking
behind
them
giles
has
a
flashlight
everyone
stay
close
riley
to
xander

also
frolic
merriment
and
neardeath
hijinks
look
there
it
is
riley
pushes
past
willow
and
tara
they
approach
a
long
trench
in
the
ground
it's
about
four
feet
deep
ten
feet
wide
and
several
hundred
feet
long
at
its
end
there's
a
large
chunk
of
what
looks
like
rock
they
all
run
up
to
the
edge
of
the
trench
riley
jumps
down
into
it
as
giles
moves
his
flashlight
over
the
rock
wow
we
have
meteorite
the
rock
at
the
end
of
the
trench
is
steaming
or
smoking
is
it
hot
riley
puts
his
hands
toward
it
'cause
uh
if
there's
radiation
you
could
like
go
all
sterile
riley
looks
alarmed
xander
jumps
backward
riley
touches
the
rock
carefully
no
it's
not
hot
it's
warm
and
broken
riley
kneels
to
look
at
it
everyone
stares
it's
sort
of
giles
hollow
yeah
so
uh
we're
all
thinking
the
same
thing
right
festive
pinata
delicious
candy
something
evil
crashed
to
earth
in
this
and
then
broke
out
and
slithered
away
to
do
badness
in
all
fairness
we
don't
really
know
about
the
slithered
part
oh
no
i'm
sure
it
frisked
about
like
a
fluffy
lamb
let's
look
around
maybe
we
can
figure
out
where
it
went
they
move
off
riley
climbs
out
of
the
trench
to
join
them
they
all
go
a
little
way
into
the
woods
willow
moves
around
some
trees
and
finds
the
security
guard
lying
on
the
ground
it
went
here
they
all
rush
over
riley
kneels
by
the
body
and
feels
its
neck
no
pulse
xander
joins
riley
by
the
guard's
head
yep
the
space
lamb
got
'im
anya
giles
gives
her
a
disgusted
look
i
don't
see
any
marks
on
him
ii
know
him
he
he
was
at
the
hospital
a
mental
patient
they
released
him
today
everyone
leans
down
to
look
at
the
body
riley
takes
out
a
pen
and
brings
it
toward
the
guard's
mouth
uh
riley
what
are
you
doing
i'm
not
sure
there's
something
he
sticks
the
pen
in
the
guard's
mouth
and
it
comes
out
covered
with
a
clear
slimy
substance
everyone
reacts
at
the
same
time
making
disgusted
noises
and
covering
their
noses
as
it
obviously
smells
bad
oh
that
might
be
toxic
don't
touch
it
oh
yeah
touching
it
was
my
first
impulse
luckily
i've
moved
on
to
my
second
which
involves
dryheaving
and
running
like
hell
xander
straightens
up
oh
man
does
that
smell
so
what
do
we
do
now
we
can't
call
buffy
willow
beat
i
wanna
call
buffy
you
can't
she's
got
life
stuff
that
has
to
come
first
so
so
we'll
just
figure
this
out
ourselves
we're
experienced
yes
'cause
it
seems
like
we're
always
dealing
with
creatures
from
outer
space
except
that
we
don't
ever
do
that
riley
gets
up
this
is
definitely
new
territory
perhaps
we
should
explore
a
bit
more
head
into
the
woods
a
bit
they
all
look
into
the
woods
it's
dark
and
scarylooking
who
votes
research
everyone
raises
their
hands
and
starts
to
walk
away
except
riley
research
yeah
i
think
that's
a
good
call
there
could
have
been
some
other
cases
like
this
i'm
gonna
stay
here
examine
the
body
some
more
look
around
a
little
bit
yeah
don't
do
anything
hunterly
no
no
i'm
just
not
great
at
research
which
i'm
sure
you
guys
figured
out
i
like
me
a
good
crime
scene
um
give
us
a
call
if
you
need
help
believe
me
something
jumps
out

for
any
other
meteorite
landings
in
the
last

big
zippo
anya

pretty
pleased
about
that
uh
guys
i've
got
some
stuff
willow
everyone
looks
at
her
the
most
recent
meteoric
anomaly
was
the
tunguska
blast
in
russia
in
1917
willow
giles
gets
up
to
come
behind
her
and
look
at
the
screen
some
witnesses
claimed
the
meteor
was
hollow
hmm
maybe
with
a
chewy
demon
center
like
ours
how
far
back
does
this
list
of
anomalies
go
pretty
far
back
to
the
queller
impact
in
the
twelfth
century
the
what
queller
ii
don't
know
why
they
call
it
that
it
didn't
hit
a
place
called
queller
or
anything
it
landed
just
outside
of
reykjavik
in
iceland
wait
i
just
saw
xander
flipping
pages
queller
quell
here
here
primitive
people
used
to
believe
that
the
moon
was
a
cause
of
insanity
sometimes
they
would
pray
to
the
moon
to
send
a
special
meteor
to
fix
the
problem
the
moon
had
caused
these
meteors
were
expected
to
quell
xander
slams
the
book
down
on
the
table
the
madmen
the
man
in
the
woods
he
was
a
mental
patient
and
he
got
pretty
well
quelled
okay
i'm
looking
in
history
right
now
it
says
in
the
middle
ages
there
were
these
sweeping
plagues
of
madness
people
were
losing
their
marbles
everywhere
but
then
it
would
suddenly
subside
and
these
dates
look
pretty
close
likelike
maybe
it
happened
after
each
one
of
the
meteor
events
so
something
emerged
from
the
meteors
and
quelled
the
madmen
meteor

in
followed
by
the
commandos
spike
and
buffy
turn
and
see
more
commandos
coming
in
the
back
door
the
commandos
yell
random
orders
to
each
other
riley
looks
at
spike
and
buffy
apparently
holding
hands
spike
gives
him
a
sour
look
riley
to
buffy
are

okay
buffy
frowns
at
him
then
rushes
to
the
stairs
spike
to
riley
you
just
missed
a
real
nice
time
riley
looks
down
and
sees
the
queller
lying
dead
with
the
knife
in
its
back
buffy
bursts
into
joyce's
bedroom

putting
their
heads
on
her
shoulders

puts
her
arms
around

everything's
all

everything's
all
right
cut
to
exterior
hospital
night
ben
comes
down
some
stairs
walks
over
to
a
car
unlocks
it
and
gets
in
looking
around
nervously
as
he
closes
the
door
a
voice
speaks
up
from
the
back
seat
it's
strange
dreg
ben
looks
up
startled
and
looks
at
him
in
the
rearview
mirror
a
body
might
ask
what
exactly
it
is
you
think
you're
doing
he
might
ask
what
all
this
was
meant
to
accomplish
because
to
a
humble
postulant
it
looks
like
chaos
like
unnecessary
attention
drawn
where
it
ought
not
to
be
ben
angrily
get
out
sir
dreg
gets
out
stands
by
the
driver'sside
window
sir
forgive
me
i
just
want
to
understand
why
summon
the
queller
what
do
you
think
because
i'm
cleaning
up
glory's
mess
just
like
i've
done
my
whole
damn
life
he
starts
the
car
and
drives
off
as
dreg
watches
cut
to
hospital
a
nurse
is
putting
an
iv
in
joyce's
arm
as
buffy
sits
on
the
bed
by
her
holding
her
other
hand
joyce
winces
as
the
needle
enters
her
arm
the
nurse
finishes
and
leaves
buffy
sighs
buffy
uh
joyce
clears
throat
i'm
gonna
ask
you
something
aand
if
i'm
if
i'm
being
crazy
you
just
tell
me

buffy
nods
you
got
it
the
other
day

actually
i'm
i'm
not
sure
when
the
days
seem
to
all
bleed
together
it's
not
important

i
guess
it
isn't
i
do
know
i
was
pretty
out
of
it
and
i
had
notnot
a
dream

more
like

this
knowledge
iit
just
came
to
me
like
truth
you
know
joyce
buffy
frowns
even
though
it
didn't
seempossible
even
though
i
shouldn't
even
think
such
things
what
that
dawn
buffy
looks
very
startled
she's
not
mine
is
she
buffy
stares
at
her
mom
then
looks
down
she
comes
to
a
decision
and
looks
joyce
in
the
eye
no
joyce
absorbs
this
for
a
moment
she's
she
does
belong
to
us
though
yes
she
does
and
she's
important
to
the
world
precious
joyce
buffy
nods
as
precious
as
you
are
to
me
buffy
smiles
and
nods
again
joyce
nods
back
then
we
have
to
take
care
of
her
buffy
promise
me
if
anything
happens
if
i
don't
come
through
this
buffy
mom

no

me
no

i
do
without
you
buffy
hugs
her
mom
tightly
looking
as
if
she'd
like
to
ask
the
same
question
cut
to
joyce
on
a
gurney
being
wheeled
away
she
has
one
arm
up
behind
her
head
and
she
smiles
down
the
hall
as
she
moves
backward
shot
of
buffy
and
dawn
with
arms
around
each
other
watching
behind
them
we
can
see
riley
xander
anya
giles
tara
and
willow
the
camera
moves
back
from
them
as
if
we
see
them
from
joyce's
perspective
shot
of
joyce
looking
very
calm
as
the
nurses
take
her
away
shot
of
the
others
watching
the
camera
continues
to
pull
back
from
them
and
then
fades
to
black
joss
whedon
