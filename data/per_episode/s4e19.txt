prologue

willow
and
tara
walking
across
campus
do
you
like
cats
i'm
more
of
a
dog
person
myself
but
i'm
not
like
death
to
all
cats
why
'cause
i
was
thinking
of
getting
one
can
you
have
one
in
the
dorms
no
but
this
would
be
a
sneaky
cat
that
would
be
cool
you
mean
it'd
be
sort
of
like
a
familiar
actually
ii
was
thinking
it
would
be
sort
of
like
a
pet
you
know
we
could
we
could
name
her
trixie
or
miss
kitty
fantastico
or
something
and
we
could
make
kitty
go
bonkers
with
string
and
catnip
and
stuff
absolutely
fun
i'm
in
so
you're
not
allergic
or
anything
nope
good
cause
i
want
my
room
to
be
willowfriendly
me
too
they
hold
hands
and
keep
walking
so
i'm
excited
about
the
scooby
meeting
i
think
what's
it
about
i'm
not
sure
probably
just
your
gardenvariety
disaster
zippo
cut
to
giles'
apartment
patrol's
been
totally
uneventful
my
kill
count's
way
down
see
the
gang
buffy
sitting
on
giles'
desk
riley
standing
in
living
room
anya
on
xander's
lap
xander
willow
and
tara
on
stools
against
the
kitchen
counter
giles
in
kitchen
willow
to
tara
she
means
there's
been
less
badguy
activity
well
we
know
what
that
often
indicates
buffy
doesn't
make
her
quota
xander
shakes
finger
at
buffy
bad
slayer
well
i
wish
it
were
that
innocuous
but
with
adam
around
i
feel
he's
involved
somehow
giles
is
holding
a
bag
of
snacks
he
pours
snacks
into
a
bowl
willow
to
tara
when
things
get
slow
it's
usually
because
there's
some
extra
evil
brewing
tara
nods
except
the
weird
thing
is
we've
been
busy
at
the
initiative
our
squads
are
pulling
a
lot
more
captures
we
got
demons
coming
out
our
ears
willow
to
tara
that's
a
metaphor
tara
smiling
i
got
it
thanks
i'm
overhelping
aren't
i
tara
laughs
giles
coming
out
of
kitchen
with
bowl
so
the
activity's
shifted
but
not
stopped
giles
hands
bowl
to
willow
but
she
doesn't
take
it
that's
fascinating
giles
sits
at
desk
and
puts
bowl
down
to
an
extremely
bored
person
maybe
giles
looks
annoyed
well
that
was
a
thrilling
hour
everyone
starts
to
get
up
giles
rising
you
know
i
really
don't
appreciate
your
snide
remarks
anya
anya
and
xander
look
at
him
in
surprise
now
i
have
a
great
deal
of
experience
in
these
matters
hear
the
door
open
buffy
and
riley
look
toward
it
giles
keeps
talking
and
if
i
say

is
a
matter
of
some
import
brewing
ii
giles
notices
everyone

i
was
missing
something
this
afternoon

i
riley
and
buffy
walk
through
graveyard
he
wears
his
battle
fatigues
buffy
wears
a
long
leather
coat
and
a
white
cap
riley
carries
a
bag
i
mean
breakups
are
tough
but
when
oz
walked
in
it
seemed
like
emotions
were
running
extra
high
oz
and
willow
had
a
rough
breakup
riley
nods
grr
hold
that
thought
buffy
ducks
and
riley
punches
the
demon
over
her
head
then
he
lifts
buffy
by
the
waist
and
she
kicks
the
demon
it
spins
away
punches
buffy
ducks
riley
punches
buffy
kicks
riley
grabs
the
demon
and
hurls
it
over
a
gravestone
it
falls
unconscious
man
that
was
record
time
buffy
pouting
it's
no
fun
when
they're
that
easy
riley
grinning
speak
for
yourself
riley
takes
out
radio
base
this
is
agent
finn
we've
an
hst
down
please
send
a
retrieval
team
to
sector
72
radio
unintelligible
finn
we'll
get
there
as
soon
as
we
can
riley
puts
radio
away
and
picks
up
his
bag
they
walk
on
so
i
was
just
about
to
say
something
fascinating
oz
and
willow
right
they
had
a
rough
breakup
some
stuff
came
up
and
oz
pretty
much
bailed
overnight
it
left
will
really
devastated
i
remember
the
thing
is
before
that
they
were
doing
great
i
mean
she
was
totally
dealing
with
oz
being
a
werewolf
it
wasn't
even
whoa
wait
they
stop
walking
oz
is
a
werewolf
and
willow
was
dating
him
yes
hence
the
high
emotions
you're
kidding
me
gotta
say
i'm
surprised
i
didn't
think
willow
was
that
kind
of
girl
what
kind
of
girl
into
dangerous
guys
she
seems
smarter
than
that
oz
is
not
dangerous
something
happened
to
him
that
wasn't
his
fault
god
i
never
knew
you
were
such
a
bigot
buffy
starts
to
walk
away
riley
stopping
her
whoa
hey
how
did
we
get
to
bigot
i'm
just
saying
it's
a
little
weird
to
date
someone
who
tries
to
eat
you
once
a
month
yeah
well
love
isn't
logical
riley
it's
not
like
you
can
be
mister
joe
sensible
about
it
all
the
time
riley
rolls
his
eyes
god
knows
i
haven't
been
i'm
not
talking
about
you
how
about
we
don't
talk
about
this
at
all
okay
let's
just
patrol
she
walks
off
looking
angry
riley
is
confused
he
follows
her
cut
to
willow's
dorm
willow
opens
her
dorm
room
door
oz
is
leaning
against
the
door
frame
hey
willow
nervous

oz
smiles
so

both
wearing
jackets
willow
stops
walking
oz
oz

walking
too
this
is
all
so
weird
oz
sighs
fidgets
with
something
on
his
hand
iii
feel
like
this
isn't
really
happening
like
it's
a
dream
or
or
something
it's
real
look
up

story
willow
looks
up
again
then
down
smiling

god
oz
she
hugs
him
he
holds
her
and
closes
his
eyes
willow

and
takes
her
hand

graham
takes
out
his
handgun
they
all
look
and
see
rustling
in
the
bushes
a
noise
from
behind

them
turn
and
then
something
comes
out
of
the
bushes
it
looks
like
a
werewolf
they
try
to
grab
it

graham
and
another
soldier
graham
goes
flying
backward
into
a
tree
and
falls
to
the
ground

other
soldier
flies
back
onto
the
ground

up
but
is
pushed
over
again
the
creature
is
on
top
of
him
and
he
screams
the
third
commando

attacked
by
another
creature
and
flies
into
another
tree
graham
lifts
his
head
and
sees
the
first

with
its
mouth
covered
in
blood
graham's
head
drops
back
onto
the
ground

buffy
with
false
cheer
like

willow

buffy
stops
herself
sighs

buffy
sits
on

question
willow
looks
skeptical
i'm
glad

told
me
what

then
we
started

sympathetic

oz
you
know
yeah
i
know
i
don't
wanna
hurt
anyone
buffy
no
matter
what
somebody's
gonna
get
hurt
and
the
important
thing
is
you
just
have
to
be
honest
or
it's
gonna
be
a
lot
worse
willow
nods
cut
to
the
tombs
spike
lying
on
top
of
a
coffin
covered
with
a
blanket
footsteps
slowly
approaching
a
greenish
hand
reaches
for
spike's
throat
but
he
grabs
it
spike
not
opening
his
eyes
from
the
sound
of
those
massive

just
gasps
and
stares
at
him
are
you
two
involved
i

i
i
i

and
she
never
tara
starts
to
walk
away
no
stop
oz
grabs
her
again
tara
looks
scared
oz
yelling
is
she
in
love
with
you
tell
me
is
she
oz
shakes
her
by
the
shoulders
then
he
lets
her
go
he's
panting
they
look
down
at
his
hand
and
it
grows
fur
and
claws
tara
looks
really
scared
oz
looks
up
his
face
is
halfwolfed
and
his
eyes
are
black
run
commercial

tara
runs
through
the
hallways
not
carrying
books
anymore
the
werewolf
chases
her
she
runs
into
a
classroom
up
the
tiers
of
chairs
tries
to
get
out
the
back
door
but
it's
locked
the
werewolf
chases
her
up
the
stairs
then
back
down
she
tries
to
get
away
but
he
corners
her
tara
screams
and
throws
a
chair
at
him
he
collapses
and
doesn't
move
tara
stands
there
panting
we
see
a
tranquilizer
dart
sticking
out
of
the
werewolf
riley
and
forrest
and
a
bunch
of
other
initiative
guys
come
in
riley
is
putting
away
the
tranquilizer
gun
are
you
okay
what's
going
on
we'll
take
it
from
here
riley
and
the
others
are
putting
oz
in
a
bag
this
thing
looks
like
it
may
be
one
of
the
demons
that
took
out
graham's
guys
the
other
night
we'll
take
it
back
we'll
make
an
id
if
it
is
we'll
put
him
down
you
don't
understand
that's

tara
stuttering
listen
we
know
what
we're
doing
you're
in
shock
but
we'll
handle
it
forrest
walks
away
no
cut
to
adam's
underground
lair
well
that
sounds
like
a
lot
of
fun
you
see
my
problem
though
total
annihilation
of
the
humans
doesn't
help
me
i'll
be
needing
heavy
casualties
on
both
sides
i
get
that
i'm
still
not
sure
how
the
slayer
fits
in
the
humans
need
a
leader
a
champion
the
slayer
can
do
that
spike
skeptical
yeah
the
thing
about
the
slayer
is
she
is
a
whiny
little
thing
but
when
it
comes
to
the
fighting
she
does
have
a
slight
tendency
to
win
then
i
guess
you
should
be
on
her
side
spike
smiles
tolerantly
this
all
goes
down
the
chip
comes
out
yeah
no
tricks
scout's
honor
you
were
a
boy
scout
parts
of
me
cut
to
willow
in
the
school
library
pretending
to
read
tara
rushes
in
willow
sees
her
and
gets
up
what's
up
you
okay
oz
we
were
talking
and
he
changed
right
in
front
of
me
what
it's
daylight
i
know
but
it
happened
oh
my
god
are
you
all
right
i'm
fine
riley
and
the
commando
guys
they
stopped
him
but
they
don't
know
it's
oz
i
tried
to
tell
them
but
they
took
him
away
when
just
now
tara
nods
i
think
they
might
hurt
him
i
i
have
to
go
i
have
to
find
buffy
i
know
willow
runs
off
tara
looks
upset
cut
to
giles'
place
xander
and
anya
on
the
sofa
giles
behind
it
willow
pacing
buffy
in
the
background
on
the
phone
tara
said
they
took
him
right
before
she
found
me
so
that's
good
right
i
mean
they
probably
haven't
had
time
to
eviscerate
him
yet
willow
sits
on
sofa
an
you
can
help
by
making
this
a
quiet
time
once
again
we're
faced
with
a
fairly
daunting
prospect
of
having
to
infiltrate
the
initiative
it'd
be
great
if
we
knew
someone
dating
a
man
on
the
inside
someone
with
connections
buffy
hangs
up
phone
and
comes
around
to
the
sofa
oh
wait
xander
gestures
at
buffy
he's
still
not
answering
his
pages
i
left
him
another
message
so
what
do
we
do
well
we
need
to
move
fast
so
we
make
a
plan
without
riley
shot
of
giles
looking
concerned
and
hope
he
calls
cut
to
underground
at
the
initiative
ozwolf
is
in
a
cage
growling
and
trying
to
get
out
riley
forrest
soldiers
with
guns
and
scientists
in
white
coats
are
watching
another
scientist
approaches
what's
the
word
doc
is
this
the
animal
that
took
apart
our
men
we
don't
know
yet
soldier
what's
the
holdup
i
thought
graham
gave
you
a
full
description
the
holdup
is
that
he
described
characteristics
present
in
over
40
known
varieties
of
demon
so
we're
crosschecking
dna
evidence
hair
fibers
riley
impatient
and
how
long
is
that
gonna
take
doc
1
annoyed
i
have
no
idea
i
don't
need
a
bunch
of
tests
to
know
that
this
thing's
a
killer
takes
out
his
gun
and
points
it
at
oz
suddenly
oz
stops
growling
and
morphs
back
into
his
human
self
riley
lowers
his
gun
and
steps
back
everyone
looks
surprised
oz
looks
up
at
them
panting
and
closing
his
eyes
fade
to
white
screen
fade
to
oz's
perspective
lying
on
a
table
with
two
docs
over
him
and
many
more
in
the
background
doc

is
on
the
left
shining
a
flashlight

groggy
riley
pushes
forward

talk
for
a
while
we
gave
him
haldol
to
keep
him
quiet
doc
1
shining
flashlight
on
oz's
teeth
why
he's
not
a
threat
now
i
allowed
you
to
stay
as
long
as
you
let
us

our
work
agent
finn
only
colonel
mcnamara
can
place
a
cease
order
on
medical
testing
and
he's
told
us
to
proceed
i
always
suspected
that
stuff
about
werewolf
transformations
being
based
on
a
lunar
cycle
was
campfire
talk
doc
2
injects
oz
with
something
oz
groans

points
to
the
other
soldiers

angry
but
lets
the
other
soldiers
escort
him
away
doc
2
puts
the
tip
of
the
instrument
on
oz's
chest
and
zaps
him
with
electricity
oz
screams
and
turns
into
the
werewolf
see
that
transformation
related
to
negative
stimulation
the
docs
exchange
a
look
cut
to
giles'
house

past
the
guy
standing
guard
outside

to
him

i

buffy
just
looks
at
him
i
just
wanted
to
hear
that
out
loud
they

cut
to
the
gang
walking
down
the
halls
with
buffy
holding
her
crossbow
to
the
colonel's
head

the
hallway
in
front
of
them
suddenly
fills
up
with
soldiers
holding
guns

oz
in
his
cell
nearby
watching
buffy
sees
him
too
more
soldiers
appear
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
buffy
and
the
gang
are
trapped
stay
back
or
i'll
pull
a
william
burroughs
on
your
leader
here
everyone
looks
confused
you'll
bore
him
to
death
with
free
prose
buffy
looks
annoyed
was
i
the
only
one
awake
in
english
that
day
buffy
slowly
like
you'd
talk
to
an
idiot
i'll
kill
him
buffy
to
the
colonel
get
him
out
the
colonel
nods
to
one
of
the
soldiers
who
drops
his
gun
and
lets
oz
out
willow
starts
forward
oz
will
get
back
he
looks
down
at
his
hand
which
is
hairy
and
clawed
again
willow
steps
back
looking
shocked
oz
concentrates
and
his
hand
goes
back
to
normal
riley
steps
forward
and
grabs
him
let's
go
still
holding
the
colonel
they
go
back
down
the
hall
the
soldiers
follow
they
get
into
the
elevator
everyone
stands
silently
looking
at
each
other
until
the
elevator
stops
everyone
gets
out
except
riley
buffy
and
the
colonel
riley
opens
the
elevator
control
panel
and
rips
out
the
wires
creating
lots
of
sparks
he
and
the
colonel
glare
at
each
other
buffy
gets
out
of
the
elevator
still
covering
the
colonel
with
her
crossbow
riley
follows
you're
a
dead
man
finn
riley
turns
back
no
sir
i'm
an
anarchist
he
punches
the
colonel
in
the
face
and
walks
away
cut
to
the
old
sunnydale
high
ruins
buffy
and
riley
are
setting
up
a
campsite
they
have
coolers
and
a
camp
lantern
riley
spreads
a
sleeping
bag
on
the
ground
buffy
is
pouring
from
a
thermos
i
hope
everybody
else
is
okay
it
was
better
to
split
up
right
i
mean
we're
just
too
findable
in
a
big
clump
it
was
better
besides
i
think
it's
mostly
me
the
initiative
wants
now
he
sits
on
the
sleeping
bag
and
sighs
probably
so
what
should
we
do
riley
puts
his
head
in
his
hands
we'll
be
safe
for
tonight
at
least
the
campus
is
still
blacked
out
so
that
oughta
slow
the
initiative
down
i'll
riley
gestures
vaguely
figure
out
my
next
move
tomorrow
buffy
sighs
quite
a
day
huh
riley
nods
you
woke
up
to
a
big
bowl
of
wheaties
now
you're
a
fugitive
buffy
comes
over
to
sit
next
to
him
i
don't
know
i'm
sorry
it
ended
that
way
but
i
am
glad
it's
done
i'm
glad
i
know
where
i
stand
finally
buffy
looks
pensive
i
was
wrong
about
oz
i
was
being
a
bigot
buffy
shakes
her
head
no
you
weren't
you
were
thrown
you
found
out
that
willow
was
in
kind
of
an
unconventional
relationship
and
it
gave
you
a
momentary
wiggins
it
happens
still
i
was
in
a
totally
black
and
white
space
people
versus
monsters
and
it
ain't
like
that
especially
when
it
comes
to
love
buffy
looks
up
she
comes
to
a
decision
i
have
to
tell
you
some
stuff
about
my
past
and
it's
not
all
stuff
that
you're
gonna
like
riley
looks
a
little
nervous
he
can
tell
this
is
important
you
can
tell
me
anything
i
think
so
buffy
smiles
i
think
i
can
cut
to
oz
and
willow
sitting
in
oz's
van
this
thing
looks
pretty
good
considering
you
drove
it
overseas
oz
doesn't
look
at
her
well
it
broke
down
outside
of
mexico
and
i
traded
my
bass
to
have
it
fixed
and
garaged
pause
i
shouldn't
have
come
back
now
i
just
thought
i'd
changed
you
have
changed
willow
smiles
you
stopped
the
wolf
from
coming
out
i
saw
it
but
i
couldn't
look
at
you
oz
still
can't
i
mean
it
turns
out
the
one
thing
that
brings
it
out
in
me
is
you
which
falls
under
the
heading
of
ironic
in
my
book
it
was
my
fault
i
upset
you
he
finally
looks
at
her
well
so
we're
safe
then
oz
sarcastic
'cause
you'll
never
do
that
again
willow
tries
to
look
amused
but
you're
happy
willow
smiles
i
am
i
can't
explain
it
it
may
be
safer
for
both
of
us
if
you
don't
willow
looks
sad
i
missed
you
oz
i
wrote
you
so
many
letters
but
i
didn't
have
any
place
to
send
them
you
know
pause
i
couldn't
live
like
that
it
was
stupid
to
think
that
you'd
just
be
waiting
i
was
waiting
i
feel
like
some
part
of
me
will
always
be
waiting
for
you
like
if
i'm
old
and
bluehaired
and
i
turn
the
corner
in
istanbul
and
there
you
are
i
won't
be
surprised
because
you're
with
me
you
know
i
know
oz
pauses
but
now
is
not
that
time
i
guess
willow
shakes
her
head
no
they
look
at
each
other
what
are
you
gonna
do
i
think
i
better
take
off
when
pretty
much
now
willow
nods
she's
teary
again
oz
leans
over
and
they
hug
shot
of
the
campus
still
in
darkness
cut
to
tara
in
her
darkened
dorm
room
looking
out
the
window
there's
a
knock
on
the
door
she
gets
up
to
answer
it
it's
willow
holding
a
candle
no
candles
well
i
brought
one
it's
extra
flamey
tara
doesn't
say
anything
willow
steps
forward
and
gives
her
the
candle
closes
the
door
behind
herself
tara
i
have
to
tell
you
no
ii
understand
you
have
to
be
with
the
person
you
llove
willow
smiles
i
am
tara
looks
amazed
you
mean
i
mean
willow
pause
okay
oh
yes
i
feel
horrible
about
everything
i
put
you
through
aand
i'm
gonna
make
it
up
to
you
starting
right
now
tara
starts
to
smile
right
now
willow
smiles
and
nods
tara
blows
out
the
candle
end
