breath
and
turns
around

to
her
cut
to

park
who
buffy
walks
along
the
roof
keeping
watch
the
girl
the
slayer
buffy
senses
something
and
heads
for
the
edge
of
the
roof
cut
to
the
park
your
heart
stinks
of
her
drusilla
puts
her
hand
on
his
chest
poor
little
thing
drusilla
cut
to
buffy
she
has
no
idea
what's
in
store
buffy
looks
over
the
edge
and
sees
them
standing
close
together
she
can
overhear
this
can't
go
on
drusilla
it's
gotta
end
she
tilts
her
head
and
reaches
up
for
a
kiss
oh
no
my
pet
this
is
just
the
beginning
she
pulls
away
without
kissing
and
gives
him
an
evil
smile
she
keeps
her
head
turned
to
him
as
she
slowly
walks
away
buffy
swallows
at
what
she
sees
angel
watches
drusilla
go
for
another
moment
then
turns
to
leave
also
buffy
steps
away
from
the
edge
of
the
roof

sunnydale
high
school

a
secret
cut
inside
jenny

giles

down
the
stairs

kind
of
a
secret
uh
the
kind
that's
secret
you
know
where
i
don't
actually
tell
you
what
it
is
i
think
it's
customary
that
when
two
people
are
going
out
on
an
evening
that
they
they
both
have
an
idea
of
where
they're
going
oh
come
on
where
is
your
sense
of
adventure
well
i
i
uh
how
will
i
know
what
to
wear
jenny
looks
at
his
tweed
suit
do
you
own
anything
else
uh
wwell
not
as
such
no
um
jenny
laughs
rupert
you're
gonna
have
to
trust
me
alright
alright
i
pput
myself
in
your
hands
that
sounds
like
fun
jenny
starts
on
her
way
okay
tomorrow
night
730
right
yes
buffy
comes
up
to
him
as
jenny
leaves
hey
hello
giles
they
start
to
the
library
um
did
we
hunt
last
night
i
did
a
couple
quick
sweeps
downtown
any
encounters
nothing
vampirey
uh
i've
been
researching
your
friend
spike
uh
the
profile
is
fairly
unappetizing
but
ii
still
haven't
got
a
bead
on
why
he's
here
you'll
figure
it
out
you
alright
you
seem
a
little
glum
i'm
fine
they
stop
outside
the
library
why
don't
you
take
the
night
off
okay
that'd
be
nice
yes
you
could
spend
some
time
with
angel
i
don't
know
he
might
have
other
plans
she
walks
off
to
class
giles
wonders
what
that
was
all
about
cut
to
class
buffy
opens
a
note
from
willow
do
you
know
who
she
was
well
it
seems
like
louis
xvi
was
just
sort
of
a
weak
king
buffy
and
willow
glance
at
each
other
buffy
starts
to
write
an
answer
to
the
note
that's
fair
enough
uh
any
other
impressions
the
camera
pans
forward
to
cordelia
sitting
in
front
of
buffy
xander
is
across
from
her
in
front
of
willow
and
looks
over
at
cordelia
with
his
head
propped
up
on
his
fist
i
just
don't
see
why
everyone's
always
picking
on
marie
antoinette
i
can
so
relate
to
her
she
worked
really
hard
to
look
that
good
and
people
just
don't
appreciate
that
kind
of
effort
buffy
has
finished
her
answer
to
willow's
note
no
dark
hair
old
dress
pretty
cordelia
and
i
know
the
peasants
were
all
depressed
i
think
you
mean
'oppressed'
whatever
they
were
cranky
buffy
folds
the
note
and
hands
it
back
to
willow
so
they're
like
'let's
lose
some
heads'
uhhh
that's
fair
and
and
marie
antoinette
cared
about
them
she
was
gonna
let
them
have
cake
the
camera
pans
over
to
willow
finishing
another
note
yes
well
that's
a
very
interesting
perspective
willow
hands
buffy
the
note
um
would
anyone
else
like
to
comment
buffy
opens
the
note
vampire
the
bell
rings
cut
to
the
hall
buffy
willow
and
xander
come
out
of
class
i
don't
know
i
don't
think
so
they
seemed
pretty
friendly
who's
friendly
no
one
angel
and
a
girl
willow
do
we
have
to
be
in
total
share
mode
hey

me
if
angel's
doing
somethin'
wrong
i
wanna
know
'cause

me
a
happy
xander

into
the
lounge

happy
aw

wild

buffy
crosses
her
arms
depressed
very
calm
dance
party
at
the
bronze
xander
buffy
gives
him
a
glum
look
moping
at
the
bronze
he
sits
on
a
couch
next
to
willow
ford
walks
up
the
steps
behind
buffy
i'd
suggest
a
box
of
oreos
dunked
in
apple
juice
but
maybe
she's
over
that
phase
buffy
uncrosses
her
arms
and
turns
around
ford

be
taken
and
casts
a
nervous
look
at
xander
and
willow
of

i
had
no

stops
when

can
hear
a
woman
crying

he's
almost
there
a
woman
comes
running
around
the
corner
and
past
him

continues
on
and
is
startled
by
a
metal
trashcan
flying
in

of
him
and
into
a
stack
of
crates
he
can
hear
punching
and
grunting
he
sees
someone
hit
the
pavement
face
first
he
peeks
around
the
corner
and
sees
a
vampire
get
up
and
take
a
swing
at
buffy
she
ducks
the
punch
and
kicks
the
vampire
in
the
face
the
vampire
swings
again
and
buffy
grabs
his
fist
and
holds
on
while
she
punches
him
in
the
face
ford
watches
as
she
pulls
out
a
stake
and
thrusts
it
into
the
vampire's
chest
he
staggers
back
into
the
wall
and
explodes
into
ashes

and
heads
back
to
his
library
cut
outside
the
school
at
night
buffy
and
ford
are
strolling
along
and
on
your
right
once
again
the
beautiful
campus
i
think
you've
now
seen
everything
there
is
to
see
in
sunnydale
well
it's
really
feel
free
to
say
dull
okay
dull's
good
ford
sees
two
vampires
running
or
maybe
not
so
dull
ford
buffy
sees
them
too
is
that
more
vampires
must
be
the
weather
she
pulls
out
a
stake
and
a
cross
and
hands
the
cross
to
ford
he
takes
it
and
reaches
into
his
back
pocket
to
pull
out
a
stake
of
his
own
he
smiles
and
waves
it
about
stay
close
to
me
she
hops
up
the
steps
the
vampires
just
ran
up
and
cautiously
looks
around
ford
is
close
behind
cross
and
stake
held
ready
she
looks
around
a
corner
and
sees
nothing
maybe
they
were
just
passing
through
buffy
turns
around
i
don't
think
so
a
blonde
female
vampire
grabs
her
from
behind
and
tries
to
bite
ford
takes
a
startled
step
back
buffy
does
a
high
kick
into
her
face
then
grabs
her
by
the
arm
and
flips
her
over
onto
her
back
a
male
vampire
rushes
her
and
grabs
her
pulling
her
over
a
railing
with
him
she
lands
in
a
crouch
on
the
grass
below
and
gets
up
while
the
vampire
rolls
to
his
feet
she
kicks
him
in
the
jaw
making
him
fall
backward
ford
looks
down
at
his
stake
and
cross
and
then
glances
at
the
fight
a
moment
before
quickly
approaching
the
other
vampire
and
holding
the
cross
in
her
face
and
the
stake
up
and
ready
she
hisses
at
him
you've
got
one
chance
to
live
tell
me
what
i
wanna
know
and
i'll
let
you
go
below
buffy
knocks
the
vampire
out
with
a
punch
to
the
face
and
stakes
him
she
runs
back
up
the
stairs
to
ford
who's
crouched
where
the
vampire
was
where's
the
other
one
i
killed
her
ford
coughs
i
i
killed
her
and
she
just
turned
to
dust
it
was
amazing
buffy
raises
her
eyebrows
in
surprise
cut
to
xander
willow
and
angel
walking
down
the
alley
to
the
sunset
club
the
only
thing
i
could
track
down
was
this
address
the
sunset
club
still
didn't
find
anything
incriminating
he
leaves
no
paper
trail
no
records
that's
incriminating
enough
yeah
i'm
gonna
have
to
go
with
dead
boy
on
this
one
could
you
not
call
me
that
he
knocks
on
the
door
the
viewport
opens
and
the
doorman
looks
out
we're
friends
of
ford's
the
doorman
nods
cut
inside
they
walk
in
through
the
inside
door
and
look
around
it's
gloomy
in
the
extreme
willow
wearing
a
colorfully
striped
shirt
boy
we
blend
right
in
in
no
way
do
we
stick
out
like
sore
thumbs
let's
look
around
you
guys
check
out
downstairs
sure
thing
bossy
the
cow
xander
they
start
down
okay
but
do
they
really
stick
out
what
sore
thumbs
do
they
stick
out
i
mean
have
you
ever
seen
a
thumb
and
gone
'wow
that
baby
is
sore'
xander
you
have
too
many
thoughts
willow
is
a
bit
hurt
by
that
angel
looks
down
from
the
balcony
and
continues
around
reptile
by
creaming
jesus
is
playing
the
one
hungry
life
my
life
with
the
other
willow
and
xander
walk
by
a
man
standing
in
a
coffin
dressed
as
a
movie
vampire
man
waves
hi
xander
waves
back
and
looks
around
more
are
you
probably
noticing
a
theme
here
as
in
'vampires
yay'
that's
the
one
chantarelle
gets
up
and
comes
up
behind
them
you
guys
are
newbies
i
can
tell
willow
turns
to
face
her
oh
no
we
come
here
all
the
time
don't
be
ashamed
it's
cool
that
you're
open
to
it
we
welcome
anyone
who's
interested
in
the
lonely
ones
angel
comes
down
the
stairs
behind
them
the
lonely
ones
vampires
oh
we
usually
call
them
the
nasty
pointy
bitey
ones
so
many
people
have
that
misconception
but
they
who
walk
with
the
night
are
not
interested
in
harming
anyone
they
are
creatures
above
us
exalted
you're
a
fool
xander
gives
him
a
look
you
don't
have
to
be
so
confrontational
about
it
other
viewpoints
than
yours
may
be
valid
you
know
chantarelle
goes
away
nice
meeting
you
they
turn
to
angel
you
really
are
a
people
person
now
nobody's
gonna
talk
to
us
i've
seen
enough
i've
seen
this
type
before
i
mean
they're
children
making
up
bedtime
stories
of
friendly
vampires
to
comfort
themselves
in
the
dark
is
that
so
bad
i
mean
the
dark
can
get
pretty
dark
sometimes
you
need
a
story
these
people
don't
know
anything
about
vampires
what
they
are
how
they
live
how
they
dress
a
young
man
dressed
exactly
like
angel
comes
down
the
stairs
behind
him
and
looks
him
up
and
down
before
continuing
on
angel
clears
his
throat
they
start
up
the
stairs
to
get
out
of
the
club
you
know
i
love
a
good
diatribe
but
i'm
still
curious
why
ford
the
bestest
friend
of
the
slayer
is
hanging
with
a
bunch
of
vampire
wannabes
something's
up
with
him
you're
right
about
that
diego
overheard
them
and
watches
them
go
the
girl
talking
to
him
is
confused
about
his
reaction
are
you
okay
cut
to
the
library
buffy
comes
in
followed
by
jenny
and
giles
sorry
to
beep
you
guys
in
the
middle
of
stuff
but
it
seemed
really
weird
no
you
did
the
right
thing
absolutely
jenny
stops
in
her
tracks
you
hated
it
that
much
no
but
but
uh
vampires
on
campus
is
could
have
implications
very
very
grave
you
coulda
just
said
something
uh
honestly
i
i've
always
i've
always
been
interested
in
in
uh
monster
trucks
you
took
him
to
monster
trucks
i
thought
it
would
be
a
change
it
was
a
change
look
we
could've
just
left
whawhat
and
miss
the
nitroburning
funny
cars
no
couldn't
have
that
okay
can
we
get
back
on
the
vampire
tip
here
these
guys
were
here
with
a
purpose
yes
yes
and
uh
we
must
uh
ascertain
what
that
purpose
is
where's
your
friend
i
sent
him
home
giles
sits
at
the
table
oh
uh
good
yes
the
less
he's
involved
in
all
this
the
safer
he'll
be
he
did
bag
a
vamp
his
first
time
out
giles
takes
an
open
book
from
on
top
of
another
and
exposes
an
old
picture
of
drusilla
gotta
give
him
credit
for
buffy
notices
the
picture
that
something
wrong
buffy
picks
up
the
picture
who's
this
um
she's
called
drusilla
a
sometime
paramour
of
spike's
she
was
killed
by
an
angry
mob
in
prague

angry
mobs
like
they
used
to
'cause
this
girl's
alive

saw
her
with
angel
giles

aback
with
angel
isn't
he
supposed
to
be
a
good
guy
buffy

the
picture
back
down

need
to
read
up
on
this
nice
lady
giles
gets
up
and
heads
for
his
office
well
some
of
my
new
volumes

more
helpful

my
own
research
is
the
blonde
vampire
runs
into
him
as
she
runs
from
his
office
jenny
draws
a
startled
breath
buffy
comes
to
giles'
aid
but
is
knocked
to
the
floor
underneath
him
when
the
vampire
gives
him
a
hard
shove
she
jumps
up
onto
the
table
and
leaps
over
the
mezzanine
railing
making
her
escape
through
the
stacks
jenny
helps
giles
and
buffy
up
are

the
kitchen
at
the
summers
house
buffy
is
nursing
a
cup
of
coffee
angel
slowly
pushes
the
door
open
buffy
may
i
come
in
buffy
looks
up
sure
i
thought
once
you
were
invited
you
could
always
just
walk
in
i
can
i
was
just
being
polite
angel
closes
the
door
we
need
to
talk
do
we
buffy
picks
up
her
coffee
and
heads
into
the
dining
room
it's
about
your
friend
ford
he's
not
what
he
seems
who
is
these
days
willow
ran
him
down
on
the
computer
willow
we
found
this
address
we
checked
it
out
with
xander
and
it
turned
out
buffy
disbelieving
and
xander
wow
everybody's
in
it's
like
a
great
big
exciting
conspiracy
what
are
you
talking
about
i'm
talking
about
the
people
i
trust
who's
drusilla
angel
lowers
his
eyes
seeing
he's
been
caught
in
a
lie
and
don't
lie
to
me
i'm
tired
of
it
some
lies
are
necessary
for
what
sometimes
the
truth
is
worse
you
live
long
enough
you
find
that
out
i
can
take
it
i
can
take
the
truth
do
you
love
me
what
do
you
she
takes
a
moment
to
consider
her
answer
i
love
you
i
don't
know
if
i
trust
you
maybe
you
shouldn't
do
either
angel
turns
away
maybe
i'm
the
one
who
should
decide
i
did
a
lot
of
unconscionable
things
when
i
became
a
vampire
angel
turns
back
but
doesn't
make
eye
contact
drusilla
was
the
worst
she
was
an
obsession
of
mine
she
was
pure
and
sweet
and
chaste
and
you
made
her
a
vampire
first
i
made
her
insane
angel
looks
at
her
killed
everybody
she
loved
visited
every
mental
torture
on
her
i
could
devise
angel
buffy
looks
away
she
eventually
fled
to
a
convent
and
on
the
day
she
took
her
holy
orders
i
turned
her
into
a
demon
well
i
asked
for
the
truth
ford's
part
of
some
society
that
reveres
vampires
practically
worships
them
i
don't
know
what
he
wants
from
you
but
you
can't
trust
him
fade

buffy
smiles
weakly
when
angel
came
to
my
room
he

and
puts
his

to
his
forehead
they're
not

the
pain
passes
it's
gonna

top
of
the

to
diego
it's
kinda
drafty
in
here
buffy
starts
down
the
stairs
i'm
sorry
ford
i
just
couldn't
wait
till

i'm
rash
and
impulsive
it's
a
flaw
we
all
have
flaws
i'm
still
a
little
fuzzy
on
exactly
what
yours

i
think
it
has
to
do
with
being
a
lying
scumbag
buffy
reaches
him
everybody
lies
what
do
you
want
ford
what's
this
all
about

really
don't

just
need
to
know
i'm
gonna
be
one
of
them
you
wanna
be
a
vampire
i'm
going
to
you

a
little
picky
about
who
they
change
ov
buffy
figures
it
out

were
gonna
offer
them
a
trade
i
don't
think
i

she
grabs
him
by
the
throat
and
shoves
him
up
against
a
pillar
yeah

i
still
feel
awfully
chatty
you
were
gonna
give
them
me
tonight
ford
nods

figure
it
out

i
was
counting
on
it
ford
smiles
she
lets
go
of
his
throat
and
backs
away
he
coughs
a
bit
and
then
laughs
what's

to
happen
tonight

is
so
cool
it's
just
like
it
played
in
my
head
you

that
part
where

what's
supposed
to
happen
ford
snickers
it's
already
happening
diego
swings
the
inner
door
shut
with
a
loud
clang
she
runs
back
up
the
stairs
and
pounds
on
the
door
rigged
up
special
once
it's
closed
it
can
only
be
opened
from
the
outside
as
soon
as

looks
around
this

a
bomb
shelter
buffy
i

you
but
this
is
three
feet
of
solid
concrete
trust
me

our
chance
for
immortality

be
pigging
out
at
the
allyoucaneat

trying
to
save

my
god

chantarelle

off

sunset
they
all
walk
away
from
her
she
looks
around
for
what
to
do
next
cut
to
spike's
warehouse
he
comes
marching
out
with
his
troops
when
we
get
there
everybody
spread
out
two
men
on
the
door
first
priority's
the
slayer
everything
else
is
fair
game
and
let's
remember
to
share
people

meets
drusilla

you
sure
you're
up
for
this
i
want
a
treat
i
need
a
treat
and
a
special
one
you'll
have
lucius
spike
hold
up
his
keys
bring
the
car
around
cut
to
the
sunset
club
buffy
runs
back
up
the
stairs
to
the
door
ford
follows
her
hey
you
never
give
up
do
you
no
i
don't
that's
a
good
quality
in
a
person
too
many
people
they
just
lay
back
and
take
it
but
us
us
we
have
something
in
common
now
more
than
you
think
yeah
well
let
me
explain
something
to
you
you're
what
we
call
the
bad
guy
i
guess
i
am
ford
chuckles
buffy
looks
down
at
the
people
these
people
aren't
gonna
get
changed
are
they
the
rest
of
them
they're
just
fodder
technically
yes
but
i'm
in
i
will
become
immortal
well
i've
got
a
news
flash
for
you
braintrust
that's
not
how
it
works
you
die
and
a
demon
sets
up
shop
in
your
old
house
and
it
walks
and
it
talks
and
it
remembers
your
life
but
it's
not
you
it's
better
than
nothing
and
your
life
is
nothing
ford
snickers
ford
these
people
don't
deserve
to
die
well
neither
do
i
but
apparently
no
one
took
that
into
consideration
'cause
i'm
still
dying
buffy
begins
to
realize
what
he's
up
to
now
i
look
good
don't
i
well
let
me
tell
you
something
ford
angry
i've
got
maybe
six
months
left
and
by
then
what
they
bury
won't
even
look
like
me
it'll
be
bald
and
shriveled
and
it'll
smell
bad
no
i'm
not
going
out
that
way
buffy
turns
away
i'm
sorry
summers
did
i
screw
up
your
righteous
anger
riff
does
the
nest
of
tumors
liquefying
my
brain
kinda
spoil
the
fun
buffy
faces
him
i'm
sorry
i
had
no
idea
but
what
you're
doing
is
still
very
wrong
okay
well
you
try
vomiting
for
twentyfour
hours
straight
because
the
pain
in
your
head
is
so
intense
and
then
we'll
discuss
the
concept
of
right
and
wrong
ford
points
down
these
people
are
sheep
they
wanna
be
vampires
'cause
they're
lonely
miserable
or
bored
i
don't
have
a
choice
you
have
a
choice
you
don't
have
a
good
choice
but
you
have
a
choice
you're
opting
for
mass
murder
here
and
nothing
you
say
is
gonna
make
that
okay
you
think
i
need
to
justify
myself
to
you
i
think
this
is
all
part
of
your
little
fantasy
drama
isn't
this
exactly
how
you
imagined
it
you
tell
me
how
you've
suffered
and
i
feel
sorry
for
you
well
i
do
feel
sorry
for
you
and
if
those
vampires
come
in
here
and
start
feeding
i'll
kill
you
myself
you
know
what
summers
i
really
did
miss
you
buffy
can
only
look
at
him
outside

car

screeching
to
a
halt
ford
help
me

she
goes
tumbling
to
the
bottom
of
the
steps
he
comes
down
after
her
and
punches
her
in
the
back
as
she
tries
to
get
up
sending
her
to
the
floor
again
they
hear
the
outside
door
open
and
look
up
chantarelle
starts
up
the
stairs
to
meet
them
ford
checks
to
see
that
buffy
is
still
out
cold
on
the
floor
chantarelle
reaches
the
top
of
the
steps
as
the
inner
door
opens
spike
walks
up
to
her
in
his
game
face
and
smiles
he
roars
at
her
and
she
flinches
a
bit
but
doesn't
back
down
he
tears
the
choker
off
of
her
neck
she
starts
to
cry
in
fear
take
them
all
save
the
slayer
for
me
the
vampires
run
and
jump
down
the
stairs
to
the
people
below
and
begin
feeding
spike
grabs
chantarelle
by
the
neck
and
bites
her
violently
buffy
wakes
and
gets
up
and
ford
tries
to
hit
her
with
a
crowbar
she
grabs
his
arm
in
midswing
and
pulls
him
around
making
him
hit
his
head
on
a
concrete
pillar
he
falls
unconscious
to
the
floor
she
looks
at
the
mayhem
going
on
around
her
and
spots
drusilla
standing
by
herself
on
the
balcony
she
takes
a
running
leap
off
of
a
couch
up
to
the
balcony
railing
quickly
climbs
over
grabs
drusilla
from
behind
and
holds
a
stake
to
her
chest
spike
spike
stops
feeding
on
chantarelle
and
looks
over
at
them
drusilla
stares
at
the
stake
poised
in
front
of
her
everybody

all
stop
feeding
good
idea

their
victims
and
the
people
hurry
up
the
stairs
and
out
down
the
stairs
spike
slowly
backs
down
the
stairs
buffy
forces
drusilla
ahead
of
her
still
holding
the
stake
ready
when
buffy
reaches
the
top
of
the
stairs
she
stares
at
spike
for
a
moment
she
looks
at
drusilla
and
shoves
her
down
the
stairs
at
spike
he
catches
and
steadies
her
as
buffy
turns
and
rushes
out
the
door
he
starts
to
give
chase
as
buffy
swings
the
door
shut
behind
her
spike
slams
up
against
it
he
looks
for
the
way
to
open
it
uh
where's
the
doorknob
cut
to
the
alley
buffy
walks
out
of
the
building
and
sees
the
people
help
and
support
each
other
angel
walks
up
to
her
and

can
come
back
when

back
for
what
buffy
looks
back
at
the
entrance
for
the
body
cut
inside
the
club
the
vampires
are
banging
on
the
doors
ford

and
