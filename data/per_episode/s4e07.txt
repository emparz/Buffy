cute
in
the
face
and
you
form
no

of
i
don't

peculiar
buffy

the
handle
off
of
the
frozen
yogurt
machine
she
battles

really
there
when
you
talk
to
her
i
like
girls
i
can
get
a
grip
on
i
bet
you
do
not
that
way
just
a
little
less
ready
for
takeoff
all
the
time
there's
definitely
something
off
about
her
maybe
she's
canadian
buffy
flees
the
site
and
see
the
yogurt
machine
overflowing
in
her
wake
didn't
she
go
out
with
parker
abrams
for
about
30
seconds
abrams
yeah
there's
a
sign
of
good
taste
buffy
goes
to
the
register
and
pays
for
her
food
ok
but
you've
got
to
admit
she's
a
major
league
hottie
well
i'm
not
denying
she's
easy
on
the
eyes
i'm
just
saying
buffy
spills
both
drink
and
yogurt
on
the
floor
would
you
really
want
to
go
out
with
her
hell
yes
i
bet
a
lot
of
guys
would
like
to
get
their
hands
on
her
cut
to
spike
laying
on
the
floor
of
a
sanitary
hospital
white
chamber
he's
mumbling
as
he
drifts
towards
consciousness
slayer
i'll
kill
you
not
so
tough
i
kill
slayer
he
gets
up
and
looks
around
he
goes
to
the
glass
wall
that
holds
him
in
and
puts
his
hands
on
it
he
receives
a
severe
electric
shock
and
jumps
back
the
camera
pans
back
and
there
are
dozens
of
other
cages
with
vampires
and
other

fall
fascism

bit

human

studying

next
thing
they'll
tell

can
one

its
vagueness
but
i
assure
you
oz
will
be
back
walsh
walks
up
to
where
willow
and
riley
are
not
to
my
class
he
won't
an
educated
guess
you
know
the
rules
you
know
i
hate
exceptions
and
yet
somehow
you
feel
your
exception
is
exceptional
walsh
crosses
her
arms
in
front
of
her
looking
intimidating
oh
but
walsh
willow
cutting
her
off
it
is
to
you
but
since
i'm
neither
a
freshman
nor
a
narcissist
i
have
to
consider
the
whole
class
if
your
friend
can't
respect
my
schedule
i
think
it's
best
he
not
come
back
willow
looking
hurt
and
miserable
walks
off
buffy
who's
been
watching
from
the
sidelines
walks
up
to
walsh
you
know
for
someone
who
teaches
human
behavior
you
might
try
showing
some
it's
not
my
job
to
coddle
my
students
you're
right
a
human
being
in
pain
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
job
buffy
stalks
off
i
like
her
really
you
don't
think
she's
a
little
peculiar
cut
to
xander's
apartment
his
parents'
basement
he's
got
a
spread
of
military
weaponry
in
front
of
him
he's
trying
to
open
the
chamber
of
a
pistol
and
having
some
trouble
here
we
go
gear
for
tonight
if
some
commando
squads
are
out
there
fully
loaded
these
babies
might
give
us
the
edge
we'll
need
that's
a
very
impressive
array
where'd
it
all
come
from
uh
requisitioned
it
back
when
i
was
a
military
guy
that
was
2
years
ago
you
still
100

the
semper

assemble
an
m16
blindfolded
like
i
used
to
or
pass
weapons
drill
from
the
mobile
infantry
giles
grabs
the
pistol
and
immediately
accomplishes
what
xander
has
been
trying
to
do
for
10
minutes
might
as
well
face
it
right
now
i
don't
have
the
technical
skills
to
join
the
swiss
army
and
all
those
guys
ask
you
to
do
is
uncork
a
couple
of
sassy
cabernets
well
i'm
sure
you'll
be
ready
when
the
time
comes
oh
fear
not
hand
to
hand
i'm
still
the
man
whoever
these
guys
trained
with
i'm
sure
they're
not
ready
to
deal
with
mother
xander
calling
from
the
main
level
of
the
house
xander
yes
mom
i
made
up
a
nice
fruit
punch
for
you
and
your
friend
would
you
boys
like
some
giles
looks
up
is
it
uh
raspberry
fruit
punch
cut
to
where
riley
is
talking
to
forrest
in
their
dorm
and
he's
throwing
a
frisbee
back
and
forth
between
another
guy
so
she
says
'you
teach
human
behavior
maybe
you
ought
to
show
some'
forrest
oh
you're
lying
she
says
that
to
walsh
hope
to
die
doesn't
lack
for
guts
you've
got
to
give
her
that
yeah
but
she's
nuts
oh
come
on
like
you
never
wanted
to
tell
the
professor
off
hey
parker
parker
has
entered
the
dorm
forrest
riley
and
a
few
others
walk
over
to
him
forrest
what's
up
man
what's
the
scoop
on
buffy
summers
is
she
cool
buffy
yeah
she's
all
right
i
guess
i
mean
kind
of
whiney
how's
that
well
you
know
clingy
i
mean
we
got
a
little
physical
uh
well
fully
physical
and
then
she's
all
over
me
you
know
like
we're
betrothed
or
something
no
but
fun
was
had
yeah
parker
laughs
oh
yeah
the
word
is
stamina
i
mean
definitely
a
bunny
in
the
sack
but
later
on
well
you
know
the
difference
between
a
freshman
girl
and
a
toilet
seat
a
toilet
seat
doesn't
follow
you
around
after
you
use
it
riley
decks
parker
who
hits
the
floor
riley
walking
between
forrest
and
graham
i
can't
believe
that
i
did
that
welcome
to
the
club
do
you
have
any
idea
how
much
trouble
you
could
have
gotten
into
if
parker
reported
you
graham
he
won't
he's
too
embarrassed
i
hit
him
what
the
hell
for
hehe
was
just
being
so
crude
please
you've
heard
me
say
much
grosser
things
than
that
and
most
of
those
are
about
your
own
mother
riley
laughs
and
forrest
jokingly
smacks
him
on
the
back
of
the
head
riley
stops
abruptly
what
is
it
i
just
didn't
like
hearing
him
riley
pauses
thoughtfully
talk
about
buffy
that
way
i
think
i
well
i
guess
i
like
her
you're
kind
of
like
a
moron
so
you
you
knew
that
i
had
feelings
for
her
everybody
knows
man
oh

peculiar
dead
giveaway
buddy
i'm
always
the
last
to
know
so
whatcha
gonna
do
riley
walking
off
well
i
guess
i'm
gonna
go
see
a
girl
cut
to
the
facility
see
spike
on
the
floor
unconscious
beside
him
is
an
empty
sack
of
blood
two
lab
types
grab
him
and
are
loading
him
onto
a
gurney
as
they're
starting
to
strap
him
in
his
eyes
open
he
grabs
the
lab
guy
by
him
by
the
throat
sorry
can't
stay
got
to
go
see
a
girl
scene
transition

back
to
the
lab
spike
jumps
off
the
gurney
an
orderly
rushes
him
and
spike
grabs
him
by
the
arm
and
flips
him
over
the
gurney
sending
him
rolling
to
the
floor
spike
follows
him
ready
to
attack
and
the
orderly
grabs
him
and
slams
him
into
the
glass
wall
of
the
episode
one
vampire's
cageroom
let
me
out
bit
busy
right
now
look
i
know
where
the
exit
is
you
spring
me
you're
free
you
don't
you're
dead
spike
throws
the
orderly
off
of
him
into
another
with
a
syringe
who
accidentally
stabs
him
in
the
neck
with
it
he
falls
onto
the
gurney
the
second
orderly
looks
up
alarmed
spike
has
vamped
out
smiles
grabs
the
orderly
and
flips
him
onto
the
floor
hurry
hurry
spike
runs
over
to
the
orderly
sprawled
on
the
gurney
he
goes
through
his
pockets
and
grabs
the
security
card
he
uses
it
to
free
the
vampire
this
way
they
run
down
the
hall
and
quickly
run
under
the
closing
security
door
they
run
into
the
next
room
where
ops
guys
are
coming
out
of
an
elevator
new
plan
we
split
up
you
go
that
way
he
shoves
the
vampire
into
the
ops
guys
and
flees
cut
to
willow
laying
on
her
bed
in
the
dorm
room
she
and
buffy
share
she's
listening
to
depressing
music
looking
mopey
there's
a
knock
at
the
door
come
in
willow
sees
riley
walk
in
oh
riley
hi
hi
gee
i
hope
i'm
not
interrupting
anything
really
depressing
what's
up
riley
looking
nervous
right
to
the
point
ok
i
was
thinking
of
asking
out
buffy
she's
not
here
i
know
riley
willow
spys
buffy's
open
bag
o'
weapons
on
the
floor
by
her
bed
and
looks
alarmed
see
i
don't
know
that
much
about
buffy
but
i'm
interested
in
what
she
likes
and
so
far
well
the
only
thing
that
i
know
she
likes
is
you
whatwhat
do
you
want
me
to
do
willow
's
gotten
up
and
headed
towards
buffy's
bag
just
tell
me
something
anything
just
give
me
a
clue
to
riley
notices
willow
trying
to
subtly
nudge
the
bag
under
the
bed
with
her
foot
here
let
me
help
you
with
that
riley
scotches
the
bag
under
the
bed
just
something
that
will
start
us
talking
you
know
riley
sits
on
buffy's
bed
willow
returns
to
her's
i'm
thinking
that
how
'bout
them
broncos
won't
really
cut
it
ok
say
that
i
help
and
you
start
a
conversation
it
goes
great
you
like
buffy
she
likes
you
you
spend
time
together
feelings
grow
deeper
and
one
day
without
even
realizing
it
you
find
you're
in
love
time
stops
and
it
feels
like
the
whole
world's
made
for
you
two
and
you
two
alone
until
the
day
one
of
you
leaves
and
rips
the
stillbeating
heart
from
the
other
who's
now
a
broken
hollow
mockery
of
the
human
condition
riley
looking
a
bit
put
out
but
is
glib
yep
that's
the
plan
i
figured
it
was
oh
look
if
you
want
to
tell
me
to
go
to
hell
that's
ok
maybe
this
is
the
last
thing
you
want
to
talk
about
i
just
feel
that
well
i've
never
courted
anyone
like
buffy
before
i
don't
think
i've
ever
met
anyone
like
buffy
before
why
should
i
trust
you
just
sort
of
hoping
you'd
think
i
have
an
honest
face
i've
seen
host
faces
before
they
usually
come
attached
to
liars
all
right
i
guess
i'm
not
gonna
win
here
and
i
appreciate
you
wanting
to
protect
your
friend
riley
gets
up
to
leave
i
guess
uh
she
kind
of
brings
that
out
in
people
riley
thinks
of
the
damage
he
did
to
parker
probably
she
likes
cheese
what
well
i'm
not
saying
it's
the
key
to
her
heart
but
buffy
she
likes
cheese
that's
a
start
she
has
a
stuffed
piggy
named
mr
gordo
loves
ice
capades
without
the
irony
and
she's
dragging
me
to
this
party
tonight
at
lowell
house
oh
you're
going
that's
my
house
i
live

they
enter
the
massive
underground
bat
cave
like
facility
that
is
the
headquarters
of
the

the
problem
is
what
kind
of
girl
is
gonna
go
out
with
a
guy
who's
acting
all
joe
regular
by
day
and
then
turns

a
big
head
start

bigger
every

bagged
and
tagged
locally
so
assume
it

the
area
the
creature
has
every
advantage
right
now
fail
to
recapture
it
and
everything
we've
worked
for
the

could
end
tonight
nobody's
failin'
on
my

now
in
charge
of
this
operation

with
the
basic
mobilization
pattern
3
teams
sweep
and
search
just
like
practice
thorough
but
fast
cteam
take
the
campus
perimeter
make
sure
it
can't
leave
stake
it
if

gotta
but
only
as
a
last
resort
bteam
you're
going
down
tunnels
sewers
cemeteries
gates
and
miller
are
with
me
we
take
the
heart
of
campus
and
work
our
way
out
all
units
maintain
radio
contact
early
and
often
who's
got
questions
move
cut
to
giles
apartment
where
buffy
xander
and
giles
are
gathered
what
is
wrong
with
him
doesn't
spike
get
that
this
is
my
town
he's
resilient
and
it's
my
night

boy
toy
what
is
that
supposed
to
mean
nothing

main
target
is
you

know
what
he's
worn
out
his
welcome
tonight
i
kill
him

him
what
he
wants
