flashing
back
to
his
youth
he
has
visions
of
rituals
and
tattooing
time
to
go
to
sleep
young
giles
screams
a
vision
of
a
demon
cut
to
giles'
bedroom
he
wakes
with
a
start
he
looks
around
as
he
sits
up
in
bed
concerned
but
relieved
to
find
it
was
only
a
nightmare
cut
to
school
the
camera
pans
down
from
above
a
tree
to
buffy
and
willow
sitting
on
a
bench

on
a
beach

roundhouse
kick
to
the

but
he
grabs
her
leg
and
throws
her
onto
the
hood
of
the
car
she
scissor
kicks
him
in
the
neck
and
he
staggers
away
and
falls

and
swings
at

she
ducks
the
punch
and
jabs
him
in
the
chest
the
first
vampire
jumps
up
on
the
hood

and
buffy
knocks
him
back
off
with
a
punch
to
the
face
she
punches
the
second
one
in
the
face
too
and
he
falls
down
on
the
hood
on
his
back
she
jumps
off
of
the

and
thrusts
her
stake
into
the
first
vampire
as

tries
to
get
back
up
the
second

and
sets
it
back
down

thinks
another
moment
before
grabbing
his
pen
and
crossing

off
of
a
list
of

gets
up

in

rolls
up
his
sleeves
and
on
his
left
arm
just
above
the
inside
elbow
is
the
same
tattoo
that
philip
had
he
reaches
into
the
sink
full
of
water
cups
his
hands
and
splashes
some
on
his
face
he
looks
up
at
himself
in
the
mirror
so
you're
back
cut
to
the
city
morgue
the
camera
slowly
closes
on
the
body
storage
drawers
cut
inside

reaches
up
and
pulls
the
sheet
off
of
his

the

tag
and
closes
it

does
the

and
discovers

missing
suddenly
a
body
bag
comes
down
over
his
head
he
tries
to
struggle
but
philip
is
too
strong
for
him
philip
forces
him
into
the
storage
bay
and
slams
the
door
shut
he
slowly
starts
to
make
his

yesterday
when
i
saw
him
talking
to
the
police
everyone
stares
at
her
and
you
waited
till
now
to

didn't
think
it
was
important
we
understand
it
wasn't
about
you

what
were
the
police
talking
to
him

she
goes
to
find
a
phone
jenny
rubs
her
head
with
worry
cut
to
the
library
buffy
heads
for
giles'
office
when
she
hears
something
in
the
stacks
and
stops
in
her
tracks
to
look
she
sees
a
shadow
move
across
one
of
the
bookcases
in
the
anteroom
she
goes
up
the
stairs
and
through
the
french
doors
slowly
she
walks
down
the
main
aisle
looking
around
and
down
each
side
aisle
as
she
passes
one
a
man
watches
her
search
buffy
keeps
looking
he
sees
her
through
a
gap
in
the
books
and
puts
his
hands
against
the
bookcase
to
push
it
over
onto
her
she
looks
up
and
sees
it's
ethan
and
dashes
away
just
in
time
to
avoid
being
crushed
under
the
bookcase
ethan
tries
to
make
his
escape
but
he's
limping
heavily
and
can't
run
she
grabs
him
by
the
arm
and
turns
him
around
i
know
you
you
were
in
that
costume
shop
oh
i'm
pleased
you
remember
ethan
tries
to
go
buffy
stops
him
you
sold
me
that
dress
for
halloween
and
nearly
got
us
all
killed
but
you
looked
great
she
punches
him
squarely
in
the
jaw

his
jaw

want

anything
and
everything
you
can
about
the
mark
of
eyghon
i'll
try
the
'net
but
'mark
of
eyghon'
sounds
like
giles
and
his
books
sorta
deal
then
we
hit
the
books
willow
heads
up
into
the
stacks
xander
how
do
you
feel
about
digging
through
some
of
giles'
personal
files
and
seeing
what
you
can
find
i
feel
pretty
good
about
it
does
that
make
me
a
sociopath
nah
heads
for
the
office
cordelia
hops
off
of
the
counter
and
smiles
at
buffy
buffy
raises
her
brows
what
what
about
me
i
care
about
giles
buffy
thinks
uh
work
with
xander
well
when
i
say
'care'
i
i
mean
cordelia
okay
okay
cordelia
walks
to
the
office
buffy
goes
to
do
what
she
can
to
help
too
cut
to
giles'
apartment
building
thanks
for
bringing
me
here
jenny
cut
inside
the
apartment
not
quite
ready
to
be
home
alone
just
yet
she
accepts
a
drink
from
giles
he
walks
around
the
couch
and
sits
down
next
to
her
she
takes
a
sip
of
the
drink
ooo
jenny
uh
i'm
so
very
sorry
about
all
of
this
giles
sets
down
his
drink
and
takes
off
his
glasses
i
uh
i
never
meant
for
you
to
be
involved
in
in
uh
any
of
this
so
i
got
involved
jenny
leans
forward
that's
what
happens
when
two
people
get
involved
giles
looks
at
her
and
smiles
he
starts
to
make
a
move
in
to
kiss
her
but
stops
himself
i
really
am
however
gonna
have
to
get
you
home
it's
not
uh
i'm
not
a
very
safe
person
to
be
around
at
the
moment
nothing's
safe
in
this
world
rupert
don't
you
know
that
by
now
she
reaches
up
and
strokes
his
head
behind
his
ear
cut
to
the
library
willow
has
found
something
ah
aha
it's
not
egyptian
it's
etruscan
willow
goes
over
to
buffy
with
her
book
mistaken
for
egyptian
by
the
design
pattern
but
any
fool
can
see
it
predates
their
iconology
look
the
mark
of
eyghon
worn
by
his
initiates
willow
reads
'eyghon
also
called
the
sleepwalker
can
only
exist
in
this
reality
by
possessing
an
unconscious
host
temporary
possession
imbues
the
host
with
a
euphoric
feeling
of
power'
buffy
yeah
but
what
about
nontemporary
willow
reads
'unless
the
proper
rituals
are
observed
the
possession
is
permanent
and
eyghon
will
be
born
from
within
the
host'
cordelia
i'm
guessing
eww
wait
hey
listen
'once
called
eyghon
can
also
take
possession
of
the
dead
but
its
demonic
energy
soon
disintegrates
the
host
and
it
must
jump
to
the
nearest
dead
or
unconscious
person
to
continue
living'
buffy
i
still
don't
get
what
this
has
to
do
with
giles
i
don't
know
about
giles
but
ancient
sects
used
to
induce
possession
for
bacchanals
and
and
orgies
okay
giles
and
orgies
in
the
same
sentence
i
coulda
lived
without
that
one
cordelia
could've
lived
without
xander's
comment
uh
wait
a
minute
the
dead
guy's
all
puddly
now
so
the
demon's
gone
there
was
no
one
dead
to
jump
into
i
mean
we're
all
not
dead
right
no
no
one
dead
but
someone
unconscious
they
realize
what
happened
cut
to
giles'
apartment
jenny
yanks
the
phone
cord
from
the
wall

jenny

sip

in
a
deep
male
voice
under

skin
she
grabs

roughly
when

bar
and
stumbles
to
the
floor
buffy

an
extraordinary
high
giles

one
of

randall
he
lost

eyghon
took
him

demon
from
randall

willow
nods
and
sits

research

another
dead
body
for
the
demon
to
jump
into
yes
at
the
cemetery
well

willow
runs
for
the
phone

xander
follows
cordelia
smiles
and
follows
also
cut
to
ethan's
shop
ethan
has
finished
buffy's
tattoo
hmm
i
think
i
missed
my
calling
as
an
artist
ethan
listen
to
me
this
is
a
bad
idea
you're
dealing
with
something
very
dangerous
ethan
rolls
up
his
left
sleeve
but
it
will
get
eyghon
off
my
scent
he
picks
up
a
bottle
of
sulfuric
acid
buffy
draws
a
breath
in
fright
thinking
the
acid
is
meant
for
her
now
relax
i'm
finished
with
you
this
is
for
me
buffy
has
found
an
exposed
screw
on
the
underside
of
the
table
and
begins
scraping
her
rope
against
it
ethan
steels
himself
for
the
burn
of
the
acid
he
slowly
pours
it
onto
his
mark
of
eyghon
tattoo
buffy
looks
at
him
like
he's
insane
he
does
his
best
not
to
scream
but
lets
out
a
few
grunts
of
pain
buffy
keeps
scraping
the
rope
on
the
screw
cut
to
giles'
apartment
he's
about
to
leave
his
apartment
when
he's
caught
by
a
waking
nightmare
and
collapses
to
the
floor
unable
to
remain
standing
he
has
visions
of
the
mark
of
eyghon
and
various
friends
incarnate
of
eyghon
and
finally
of
buffy
with
her
new
tattoo
he
wakes
oh
ethan
no
no
he
quickly
gets
up
grabs
his
coat
and
staggers
out
the
door
still
weak
and
not
bothering
to
close
it
behind
him
cut
to
ethan's
he
wraps
his
arm
in
a
bandage
well
i
hate
to
mutilate
and
run
but
he
and
buffy
see
a
diffuse
green
light
shine
through
the
shop
windows
and
the
shadow
of
eyghon
jenny
coming
to
the
door
the
door
opens
and
eyghon
jenny
steps
in
well
on
her
way
to
transforming
into
eyghon
eyghon
jenny
to
ethan
in
a
deep
male
voice
it's
your
time
buffy
is
almost
through
the
rope
under
the
table
eyghon
jenny
steps
up
to
ethan
he
stares
at
her
in
fear
she
sniffs
a
few
times
and
realizes
he's
not
the
one
she's
after
anymore
she
turns
to
buffy
and
her
eyes
glow
eyghon
jenny
shoves
ethan
aside
just
as
buffy
gets
through
the
rope
buffy
rolls
off
of
the
table
and
onto
the
floor
as
eyghon
jenny
lunges
for
her
she
kicks
up
and
flips
eyghon
jenny
and
the
table
over
and
onto
the
floor
they
both
get
up
eyghon
jenny
holds
the
table
in
her
hands
and
rushes

with
it
pushing
her
into
some
crates

in
through
the
door

advances
on
giles
no
buffy

stretches
her
arm
out
at
buffy
and
she
goes
flying
into
a
pile
of
boxes
eyghon
jenny
grabs
giles
by
the
collar
pulls
him
around
and
down
to
the
floor
and
stands
over
him
i've
been
waiting
a
long
time
to

this
as
she
bends
down
to
grab
giles
angel
runs
in
through
the
door
grabs
her
and
pulls
her
to
the
crate
banging
her
head
into
it
he
takes
her
by
the
neck
and
starts
to
choke
her
willow
xander
and
cordelia

in

holds
giles
back
as
he
gets
up

killing
her

angel
continues
choking
eyghon
jenny
xander
helps
buffy
up
finally
eyghon
has
to
jump
and
does
so
right
into
angel
he
drops
jenny
as
he's
thrown
back
into
the
wall
and
begins
convulsing
when
jenny
hits
the
floor
she
is
herself
again
willow
lets
go
of
giles
and
he
immediately
gets
on
his
hands
and
knees
next
to
her
jenny
angel's
face
twists
and
contorts
as
the
demons
inside
of
him
fight
it
out
he
is
thrown
to
the
crate
and
hits
his
head
his
face
goes
through
a
few
more
contortions
when
eyghon
suddenly
appears
apparently
gaining
the
upper
hand
after
a
moment
angel's
face
shifts
back
to
normal
then
back
to
eyghon
then
back
to
normal
again
he
is
thrown
back
against
the
wall
another
moment's
struggle
and
the
demon
inside
angel
throws
eyghon
out
without
a
host
body
to
occupy
eyghon
quickly
crumbles
into
ashes
angel
gasps
and
collapses
to
the
floor
they
all
run
over
to
his
aid
giles
reaches
out
to
jenny

shifts
to
look
at
him
jenny
rupert
ethan

up

catches
up
with

jenny
jenny

sometime
um
dinner
or
or
a
drink
when
you're
feeling
stronger
buffy
sees
them
talking
sure
sometime
giles
reaches
out
to
her
but
she
takes
a
backward
step
up
and
away
from
him
and
draws
a
deep
breath
yeah
sometime
jenny
pauses
i
better
get
to
class
yes
of
course
he
watches
her
go
up
the
stairs
when
she's
gone
from
sight
he
looks
down
sadly
and
after
a
moment
starts
to
go
to
his
library
buffy
catches
up
to
him
hey
they
round
the
corner
and
stop
is
she
okay
um
the
hills
are
not
alive
buffy
doesn't
understand
i'm
sorry
to
hear
that
i
think
i
don't
think
she'll
ever
really
forgive
me
maybe
she
shouldn't
maybe
you
should
i
never
wanted
you
to
see
that
side
of
me
i'm
not
gonna
lie
to
you
it
was
scary
i'm
so
used
to
you
being
a
grownup
and
buffy
inhales
then
i
find
out
that
you're
a
person
most
grownups
are
who
would've
thought
some
are
even
uh
shortsighted
foolish
people
so
after
all
this
time
we
finally
find
out
that
we
do
have
something
in
common
which
apart
