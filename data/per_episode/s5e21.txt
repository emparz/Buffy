with
not

it's
impossible
to
know
for
sure
losing
dawn
after
all
that
buffy's
been

i
think
it's
pushed
her
too
far
into
some
sort
of
catatonia
you
don't
need
a
diploma
to
see
that
spike
moves
forward
snap
her
out

spike
grabs

spike
slaps
buffy
across
the

ow
spike
grabs
his
head
in

damage
here
you

something
i
can't
just
sit
here
watching

i'm
willing
to
wager
when
all
is
said
and
done
buffy
likes
it
rough
xander
punches
spike
in
the
face
they
grapple
willow
turns
to
them
with
a
stern
expression
separate
an
unseen
force
pushes
spike
and
xander
apart
they
both
stare
at
willow
in
surprise
she
gives
them
a
determined
glare
anya
and
giles
stare
too
willow
glaring
at
them
buffy's
out
glory
has
dawn
sometime
real
soon
she's
gonna
use
dawn
to
tear
down
the
barrier
between
every
dimension

is
so

two
wanna
fight

it
after
the
world

spike
glares
at
xander
xander
goes
over
to
anya
and
giles
leans
against
the
counter
willow

quietly
and
with
authority
all

to
a
new
day
big
day
big
big
day
shh
shh
willow
tara
whimpers
spike
moves
forward
uh
will
willow
looks
at
him
now
uh
don't
turn
me
into
a
horned
toad
for
asking
but
what
if
we
come
across
ben
spike
shot
of
the
others
listening
ii
don't
think
a
doctor's
what
buffy
needs
right
now
well
yeah
especially
not
one
who
also
happens
to
be
glory
spike
everyone
looks
confused
what
do
you
mean
you
know
ben
is
glory
willow
frowns
you
mean
ben's
with
glory
with
in
what
sense
they're
working
together
no
no
ben
is
glory
glory's
ben
they're
one
and
the
same
beat
everyone
looks
completely
confused
except
tara
who
still
looks
blank
when
did
all
this
happen
not
one
hour
ago
right
here
before
your
very
eyes
ben
came
he
turned
into
glory
snatched
the
kid
and
pfft
vanished
remember
they
continue
to
stare
at
him
spike
uncertainly
you
do
remember
spike
squints
at
them
is
everyone
here
very
stoned
they
continue
to
look
confused
spike
getting
annoyed
ben
glory
he's
a
doctor
she's
the
beast
two
entirely
separate
entities
sharing
one
body
like
a
bloody
sitcom
surely
you
remember
so
you're
saying
ben
and
glory
have
a
connection
yes
obviously
but
what
kind
spike
laughs
sarcastically
oh
i
get
it
that's
very
crafty
spike
nods
glory's
worked
the
kind
of
mojo
where
anyone
who
sees
her
little
prestochangeo
instantly
forgets
and
yours
truly
being
somewhat
other
than
human
stands
immune
willow
frowning
so
ben
and
glory
areare
the
same
person
xander
slowly
like
a
revelation
glory
can
turn
into
ben
and
ben
turns
back
into
glory
and
anyone
who
sees
it
instantly
forgets
spike
sighs
in
relief
kewpie
doll
for
the
lady
he
puts
one
finger
on
his
nose
and
points
the
other
hand
at
anya
excellent
giles
looks
around
at
them
now
do
we
suspect
there
may
be
some
kind
of
connection
between
ben
and
glory
xander
and
anya
look
enquiringly
at
spike
spike
sighs
loudly
cut
to
a
man
wielding
a
blowtorch
wearing
a
welding
mask
he
turns
off
the
blowtorch
and
lifts
the
mask
it's
the
crazy
guy
who
accosted
dawn
in
the
real
me
we
hear
rhythmic
machinery
noises
the
guy
looks
around
then
falls
to
his
knees
as
glory
enters
followed
by
dawn
and
some
minions
glory
is
again
wearing
the
robe
and
has
dawn
by
the
arm
we
see
that
we're
in
some
sort
of
warehouse
the
key
the
key
as
glory
walks
through
the
warehouse
we
see
other
crazy
people
doing
various
things
with
machinery
they
all
drop
their
tasks
and
kneel
on
the
floor
as
glory
and
dawn
go
by
the
machinery
noises
slow
and
then
stop
the
key
the
key
the
key
glory
dawn
and
the
minions
go
to
a
door
in
the
back
cut
to
murk
opening
the
door
peeking
in
then
nodding
and
gesturing
behind
him
he
enters
followed
by
dawn
and
glory
and
two
other
minions
we're
in
what
looks
like
a
construction
office
glory
pushes
dawn
into
a
chair
and
turns
away
putting
a
hand
to
her
head
she
sits
on
something
as
murk
and
gronx
hover
near
her
the
third
minion
stays
near
dawn
he's
larger
than
the
others
and
wears
more
ornate
robes
the
machinery
noises
resume
unbelievable
how
annoying
those
groupies
can
be
uh
they
merely
sense
that
tonight
at
last
the
dimensional
portal
shall
open
we
see
that
the
third
minion
is
putting
some
kind
of
paste
on
dawn's
forehead
while
chanting
in
a
foreign
language
dawn
looks
very
scared
gronx
os
ushering
in
the
long
and
bloody
reign
of
the
great
glory

out
murk
hurries
forward
and
ushers
the
priest
out
dawn
continues
to
look
frightened
in
the
background
we
can
see
a
window
through
which
the
crazy
people
are
visible
going
back
and
forth
as
they
do
whatever
they're
doing
with
the
machinery
you
know
you
recapture
your
godhood
and
unleash
armageddon
glory
picks
up
a
rag
from
a
table
uses
it
to
rub
the
stuff
off
dawn's
forehead
all
of
a
sudden
everybody
wants
to
be
a
part
of
the
inner
circle
glory
wets
the
cloth
with
her
tongue
and
rubs
at
dawn's
forehead
some
more
dawn
scrunches
up
her
face
in
disgust
glory
straightens
up
tosses
the
cloth
aside
sighs

takes
another
chair

the
wrist

shakes
it
around

softly
and

goes
around

to
the

can
see
a
poster
on
the
world
that
says
there's
money
in
arc
welding
with
a

of

arcwelding
willow
puts
two
more
candles
on

a
voice
comes
from

adult
buffy
1
wearing
a
sleeveless
blouse
and
pale
skirt
with
her
hair
loose
carrying
a
book
she
walks
over
to
a
bookshelf
puts
the

a
moment
turns
and
walks
away
willow
watches
in
some
confusion
as
buffy
1
walks
past
her
willow
glances
over
toward
where
young
buffy
was
cut
to
willow
standing
by
an
open
fire
night
she
looks
around
in
confusion
ohhkay
cut
to
giles
sitting
on
a
hospital
bed
putting
on
his
jacket
his
left
arm
is
stiff
by
his
side
and
he
can
only
get
his
jacket
onto
the
right
arm
he
gets
up
putting
his
right
hand
to
the
place
on
his
stomach
where
he
was
speared
and
walks
forward
uh
can
you
uh
xander
appears
and
helps
giles
put
the
jacket
on
as
they
walk
out
into
the
hallway
there
how
you
doing
it
only
hurts
while
i
answer
pointless
questions
where's
buffy
willow's
on
it
or
in
it
she's
workin'
some
spell
trying
to
reach
buffy
psychically
uh
she's
gone
into
buffy's
mind
xander
nods
pretty
tricky
stuff
it's
extraordinarily
advanced
um
i
was
thinking
we
should
check
on
glory's
victims
while
we're
here
as
they
continue
to
walk
we
see
the
view
in
front
of
them
around
a
corner
we
can
see
spike
looking
at
a
medical
cart
he
takes
a
bag
of
blood
from
the
cart
and
puts
it
in
his
pocket
as
he
approaches
xander
and
giles
oh
the
mental
ward
i
already
been
the
vegetable
section's
closed
nobody
there
it's
like
they
all
just
got
up
and
walked
away
xander
and
giles
reach
spike
and
they
all
stop
walking
xander
looks
pointedly
at
spike's
purloined
bloodbag
but
says
nothing
checked
out
glory's
flat
looks
like
the
great
one
has
scampered
gone
to
uh
perform
her
ritual
with
dawn
and
leaving
us
entirely
clueless
not
entirely
spike
they
look
at
him
i
know
this
bloke
well
not
so
much
a
bloke
so
much
as
a
demon
but
still
bookish
all
tuned
in
to
the
nastier
corners
of
this
our
magic
world
spike
looks
around
takes
out
a
cigarette
it's
a
bit
of
a
last
resort
really
but
still
we
might
persuade
him
to
suss
out
glory's
game
plan
spike
lights
his
cigarette
as
we
see
a
no
smoking
sign
prominently
displayed
on
the
wall
right
behind
him
sound
worthy
giles
sighs
and
shrugs
spike
nods
off
we
go
then
meet
back
at
the
shop

turns
to

on

previous
scene
buffy

again
walks
past

pauses
willow
watches
in
confusion
closer
shot
of
buffy
1
standing
by
the
bookcase
staring
at
it
but
not
really
seeing
it
lost
in
thought
willow
watches
this
with
a
small
frown
then
she
turns
to
her
right
and
we
see
the
back
of
adult
buffy
2
this
buffy
wears
jeans
and
a
black
tank
top
has
her
hair
pulled
back
into
a
ponytail
and
is
walking
away
from
willow
down
a
hallway
at
the
end
of
the
hall
we
see
a
door
that
is
slightly
ajar
with
sunlight
coming
from
behind
it
willow
begins
to
follow
buffy
2
where
are
you
going
cut
to
the
warehouse
dawn
is
still
gasping
and
choking
as
glory
holds
her
by
the
throat
the
three
minions
gather
around
glorificus
wait
kill
the
key
now
and
all
will
be
lost
we'll
be
stuck
on
this
mortal
plane
forever
all
right
you're
right
glory
releases
dawn
it's
cool
glory
dawn
staggers
back
clutching
her
throat
i'm
just
a
little
emotional
right
now
glory
small
laugh
which
if
you're
into
irony
funny
shot
of
dawn
grabbing
a
pillar
for
support
gasping
glory
os
leave
we
need
a
little
girl
time
the
minions
begin
bowing
and
glory
makes
an
impatient
gesture
goodbye
they
hurry
out
dawn
glares
angrily
at
glory
glory
puts
her
hands
to
her
face
then
rubs
the
sides
of
her
neck
how
do
they
do
it
dawn
hoarsely
do
what
people
glory
walking
toward
dawn
how
do
they
function
here
like
this
in
the
world
with
all
this
bile
running
through
them
every
day
it's
whoooo
glory
wiggles
her
hand
at
dawn
you
have
no
control
they're
not
even
animals
they're
just
these
meatbaggy
slaves
to
to
hormones
and
pheromones
and
their
and
their
feelings
hate
'em
dawn
stops
rubbing
her
neck
stares
at
glory
glory
goes
behind
a
drafting
table
and
leans
her
arms
against
it
i
mean
really
is
this
what
the
poets
go
on
about
this
glory
thumps
her
chest
shakes
her
head
sighs
call
me
crazy
but
as
hardcore
drugs
go
human
emotion
is
just
useless
people
are
puppets
everyone
getting
jerked
around
by
what
they're
feelin'
am
i
wrong
glory
looks
at
dawn
really
i
want
to
know
shot
of
dawn
leaning
against
the
pillar
looking
at
the
floor
gonna
bleed
you
either
way
dawn
opens
her
eyes
looks
at
glory
depends
on
the
person
so
you're
saying
some
people
like
this
dawn
defensively
some
funny
'cause
i
look
around
at
this
world
you're
so
eager
to
be
a
part
of
and
all
i
see
is
six
billion
lunatics
looking
for
the
fastest
ride
out
glory
smiles
who's
not
crazy
look
around
everyone's
drinking
smoking
shooting
up
shooting
each
other
or
just
plain
screwing
their
brains
out
'cause
they
don't
want
'em
anymore
glory
looks
at
dawn
i'm
crazy
honey
i'm
the
original
oneeyed
chicklet
in
the
kingdom
of
the
blind
glory
sighs
'cause
at
least
i
admit
the
world
makes
me
nuts
glory
comes
out
from
behind
the
drafter's
table
walks
toward
dawn
name
one
person
who
can
take
it
here

all
i'm
asking

in
dawn's
face

i
was
in

felt

looks
away
and
in
that
second
of
knowing
it
will
i
wanted

wanted
it
over
this
is
all
of
this
it's
too
much
for
me
buffy
2
staring
at
nothing
i
just
wanted

and
i
would
grieve

feel
sorry
for
me

looks
at

it
would
be

in

bedroom
my
thinking
it
made
it
happen
cut
back
to
the
magic
shop
some
part
of
me
wanted
it
and
in
the
moment
glory
took
dawn
i
know
i
could
have
done
something
better
but
i
didn't
i
was
off
by
some
fraction
of
a
second
and
this
is
why
i
killed
my
sister

buffy
to

guilt
willow
the
two
buffys
exchange
a
look
it's
a
feeling

it's
important

not
more
than
that
buffy
willow
glances
at
buffy

buffys
the
buffys

look
pensive

carried
the
weight
of
the
world
on
your
shoulders
since
high
school
and
i
i
know
you
didn't
ask
for
this
but
you
do
it
every
day
and
so
you
wanted
out
for
one
second
so
what
buffy

pensive
i
got
dawn

pauses
closer
shot
of
buffy

as
she
turns
toward
the
others
cut
to
the
real
buffy
in
the
chair
in
the
bedroom
suddenly
with
a
start
she
comes
to
sits
up
straighter
looks
around
breathing
heavily
longer
shot
of
her
and
willow
sitting
there
willow
stares
at
buffy
buffy
turns
to
face
willow
again
suddenly
she
bursts
into
tears
willow
gets
up
off
the
bed
and
kneels
beside
buffy's
chair
puts
her
arms
around
buffy
and
holds
her
as
she
cries
cut
to
the
real
magic
shop
giles
stands
in
the
back
making
tea
sound
of
the
door
opening
giles
looks
through
the
bookcase
toward
the
door
buffy
giles
aside
she's
back
we
see
spike
and
xander
sitting
at
the
table
beside
giles
you're
okay
yeah

okay
buffy
enters
comes
toward
the
table
behind
her
we
see
willow
leading
tara
in
and
anya
closing
the
door
behind
them
hear
you
found
the
ritual
text
uh
something
like
that
yes
did
you
know
that
ben
is
glory
so
i'm
told
what
do
we
know
um
well
uh

giles
willow
anya
and
tara
sit
around
the
table
according
to
these
scrolls
uh
it's
possible
for
glory
to
be
stopped
giles
pauses
buffy
gives
him
a
raisedeyebrow
look
to
say
go
on
ii'm
afraid
it's
um
well
buffy
i've
read
these
things
very
carefully
and
there's
not
much
margin
for
error
you
understand
what
i'm
saying
might
help
if
you
actually
said
it
giles
gives
a
small
smile
nods
puts
his
mug
on
the
table
and
sits
removes
his
glasses
um
glory
plans
to
open
a
dimensional
portal
by
way
of
a
ritual
bloodletting
dawn's
blood
yes
giles
pause
once
the
blood
is
shed
at
a
certain
time
and
place
the
fabric
which
separates
all
realities
will
be
ripped
apart
shot
of
willow
listening
while
holding
tara's
hand
tara
staring
vaguely
at
the
ceiling
and
spike
staring
at
the
table
dimensions
will
pour
into
one
another
uh
with
no
barriers
to
stop
them
giles
shot
of
xander
and
anya
listening
reality
as
we
know
it
will
be
destroyed
and
chaos
will
reign
on
earth
so
how
do
we
stop
it
the
portal
will
only
close
once
the
blood
is
stopped
and
the
only
way
for
that
to
happen
is
um

zoom
in
on
giles's
face
as
he
first
avoids
buffy's
eyes
finally
looks
up
at
her
buffy
the
only
way
is
to
kill
dawn
