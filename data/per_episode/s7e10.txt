anya's
got
a
cup
in

but
buffy
comes
into

hi
dawn
buffy
stares
at
them
but
they
avoid
eye
contact
nothing
what
dawn
wringing
hands
oh
um
i
thought
you
were
gonna
ask
us
what
we
were
doing
no

going
to
ask—
dawn
andrew
coughs
oh
look
who's

and
goes
to
andrew

silly
andrew

andrew
to

i'm—i
was
about
to
be
dead
you
saved
me
buffy
steps
up
between

offer
you
to
the

on

chop
you
into

what
the
name
of
the
evil
thing
that
pretended
to
be
warren
to
get
you
to
kill
jonathan
oh
not
very
ominous
sounding
no
iit
is
if
you
understand
the
context
no
an
evil
name
should
be
like
lex
or
voldemort
or—
hey
i
was
intimidating
here
buffy
flanking
buffy
dawn
and
anya
turn
and
glare
at
andrew
oh

dawn
investigating

from

buffy
looks
like
the
first
made
another
sacrifice
or
a
music
video
the
seal
could've
been
activated
i
bet
that's
what
the
first
needed
spike
for
andrew
panics
that
wasn't
there
before
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
thanks

satanic
manhole
cover
you
killed
your
best
friend
andrew
softly
he's

tricked
by
a
fake
ghost

it's
started
the
first
that's
what
it
wants
yes
to
erase
all
the
slayers
in
training
and
their
watchers
along
with
their
methods
and
then
faith
and
then
me
and
with
all
the
potentials
gone
and
no
way
of
making
another
it's
the
end
no
more
slayer
ever
but
we
haven't
found
any
information
on
the
first
no
documentation—
giles
crosses
arms
that's
because
it
predates
any
written
history
and
it
rarely
shows
its
true
face
the
only
record
i
know
was
in
the
council
library
what
about
the
council
what
do
they
say
about
this
gone
giles
looks
at
buffy
who
stares
back
in
shock
what
obliterated
they
were
in
session
and
uh
there
was
an
explosion
that
means
all
the
council's
records
areare
destroyed
annabelle
giles
girl
2
unzips
her
book
bag
takes
two
books
and
a
stack
of
files
from
it
and
lays
them
on
the
coffee
table
in
front
of
willow
that's
what's
left
giles
willow
anya
dawn
and
buffy
each
take
some
of
the
new
material
and
peruse
it
the
mystic
secrets
of
the
watchers
and
whatever
i
could
find
on
the
first
when
i
learned
what
was
happening
ii
um
i
stole
them
and
you
blew
the
council
up
see
this
is
what
happens
when
you're
all
stuffy
and
repressed
you
overreact
not—i
didn't
must've
been
an
agent
of
the
first
after
my
little
burglary
session
the
knowledge
contained
in
these
files
had
to
be
protected
and
there
wasn't
time
forfor
bureaucracy
or
debate
the
council
knows
no
other
way
andrew
still
tied
to
a
chair
he
lets
out
a
melodramatic
observation
and
it
cost
them
their
lives
andrew
everyone
turns
and
stares
he
sits
back
go
on
buffy
to
xander
can
we
gag
him
buffy
xander
claps
and
goes
to
andrew
putting
duct
tape
over
his
mouth
but
what
do
these
records
say
about
the
first
uh
very
little
it
can
change
form
uh
it
only
appears
in
the
guise
of
someone
who's
passed
away
our
ghosts
also
it's
not
corporeal
it
can't
touch
or
fight
on
it's
own
it
only
works
through
those
it
manipulates
and
its
followers
the
bringers
those
freaks
in
the
black
robes
yeah
with
the
hoodies
and
the
crazy
alphabet
eyes
i
never
saw
'em
i
just
heard—
shh
molly
mr
giles
doesn't
need
us
prattling
on
giles
sits
on
arm
of
couch
the
first
is
unlike
anything
we've
faced
before
i
mean
there's
evil
and
then
there's
the
thing
that
created
evil
the
source
and
that's
what
this
thing
claims
to
be
that's
what
it
is
it
has
eternities
to
act
endless
resources
giles
stands
how
to
defeat
it—ii—
giles
sighs
honestly
i
don't
know
but
we
have
to
find
a
way
if
the
slayer
line
is
eliminated
then
the
hell
mouth
has
no
guardian
the
balance
is
destroyed
giles
walks
up
to
buffy
i'm
afraid
it
falls
to
you
buffy
sorry
i
mean
we'll
do
what
we
can
but
you're
the
only
one
who
has
the
strength
to
protect
these
girls—and
the
world—against
what's
coming
but
no
pressure
girl

walks
to
the
center
of
the
room
addressing
everyone
that's
it
that's
the
plan
i
don't
see
how
one
person
even
a
slayer
could
protect
us
i
saw
what
those
bringer
guys
can
do
they
tore
apart
my
watcher
of
course
we'll
use
all
our
resources—
and
if
this
thing
is
the
root
of
all
evil
isn't
the
hell
mouth
it's
number
one
vacation
spot
i
mean
don't
you
think
we
should
be
hiding
our
asses
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
kennedy
no
she's
not
wrong
we
need
more
muscle
that's
why
we
need
to
find
spike
yeah
he'll
help
you
know
if
he's
not
crazy
or
off

people
or
dead

you
know
all

the
above
cut

spike's
head
is
thrust
underwater
and
he
struggles
under
the
force
of
hands
that
are
holding
him
down

show
that
it's

drusillafirst
is
pacing

stops
struggling
and
the

pulls
spike's
head
out

and
throws
him
on

when
she
turns

the

ineffective

retreats
but
he
follows
finally
she
gets
some
good
offensive
moves
in
but
he's
able

avoid
or
block
more
than
half
of
them
he
punches
her
again
sending
her
rolling

she
gets
to
her
feet
before

and
squeezes
until
it
makes
crunching
sounds
then
twists
her
arm
then
pulls
her
body
by

squeezing
and
lifting
her
off

pulls
her
back

there's
nothing
on

in

she
barely
gets
out

to
see
the
three
slayers
in
training
already
up
and
eating
breakfast
buffy
to
giles
the
others
just
yet
it'll
give
us
a
chance
to—
buffy
sees
the
girls
in

kennedy
eating
a

of

sorry
about

we've
been
up

annabelle
drinking
from

mug
4
pm
london
time
are
you
all
right
you
look
buffy
shuts
the
door
oh
yeah
i'm
ok
i
just
got
into
a
fight
is
all
buffy
to
giles
you
want
to
tell
me
with
what
buffy
takes
off
her
coat
yes
buffy
but
don't
you
think
we
should
uh
discuss
this
privately
you
mean
not
in
front
of
the
next
generation
no
time
to
coddle
them
giles
welcome
to
the
war
room
guys
annabelle
gets
out
a
notepad
to
take
notes
uh
what
you
fought
was
a
vampire
but
it
was
um
something
more
than
that
it
was
a
turokhan
as
neanderthals
are
to
human
beings
the
turokhan
are
to
vampires
primordial
ferociously
powerful
killing
machines
as
singleminded
as
animals
they
are
the
vampires
that
vampires
fear
an
ancient
and
entirely
different
race
and
until
this
morning
i
thought
they
were
a
myth
so
the
first
shows
up
and
now
this
you
think
it's
a
coincidence
i
think
it's
more
likely
that
the
turokhan
is
here
as
an
agent
of
the
first
um
did
you
slay
it
no
it's
still
out
there
somewhere
what's
it
want
all
of
us
dead
but
for
now
it
looks
like
sunlight
is
keeping
this
ubervamp
away
so
until
sunset
i
suggest
you
get
some
rest
a
few
hours
sleep
will
do
a
world
of
difference
no
sleep
today
can't
oh
come
on
you're
exhausted
ah
it
comes
with
the
gig
somehow
i
don't
think
taking
on
prehistoric
evil
comes
with
nap
time
sorry
potential
guys
i
know
you
came
a
long
way
and
you
wanna
get
into
it
but
the
best
thing
you
can
do
right
now
is
just
sit
tight
wait
it
out
i'm
gonna
go
to
work
see
what
i
can
find
out
i'll
be
back

standing
on
the
mouth
of
hell
and
it
is
gonna
swallow
me
whole
and
it'll
choke
on
me
we're
not
ready
they're
not
ready
they
think
we're
gonna
wait
for
the
end
to
come
like
we
always
do
i'm
done
waiting
they
want
an
apocalypse
oh
we'll
give
'em
one
anyone
else
who
wants
to
run
do
it
now
'cause
we
just
became
an
army
we
just
declared
war
from
now
on
we
won't
just
face
our
worst
fears
we
will
seek
them
out
we
will
find
them
and
cut
out
their
hearts
one
by
one
until
the
first
shows
itself
for
what
it
really
is
and
i'll
kill
it
myself
there
is
only
one
thing
on
this
earth
more
powerful
than
evil
and
that's
us
any
questions
closing
