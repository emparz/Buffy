shoots
him
with
a
stake

camera
in

that
was
great
i
completely
got
you
dusting
that
guy
on

hey
why
do
vampires
show
up
on
video
buffy
shown
through
the
camcorder
i
told
you
i
didn't
want
you
doing
that
it's
distracting
buffy
walks
away
andrew
still
taping
he
walks
beside
her
ok
i'll
cut
the

together
and
do
the
intro
tomorrow
she
was
a
woman
in
danger
or
was
she
are
you
still
filming
me
stop
but
it's
a

the
bathroom
by
his
collar
meanwhile
there's
at
least
three
girls
lined
up
outside
the

but
the
story
needs
to
be
told
anya
lets
go
of
him
birds
need
to
fly
and
girls
need
to
use
the
toilet
and
why
were
you
video
taping
yourself
anyway
sounds
like
kinky
business
to
me
the
world's
gonna
want
to
know
about
buffy
it's
a
story
of
ultimate
triumph
tainted
with
the
bitterness
for
what's
been
lost
in
the
struggle
it's
a
legacy
for
future
generations
if
there
are
any
buffy
seems
to
think
that
this
apocalypse
is
going
to
actually
be
you
know
apocalyptic
i
think
your—your
story
seems
pretty
pointless
oh
andrew
looks
away
i
was
gonna
interview
you
later
today
andrew
stands
close
to
anya
looking
in
her
eyes
'cause
you
know
your
whole
perspective
on
the
whole
thing
give
it
editorial
balance
and
uh
andrew
cocks
his
head
to
the
side
looks
at
her
glamour
anya
looks
pensive
nods
oh
well
balance
is
important
people
don't
always
take
that
into
account

being
orchestrated
by
something
called

evil
in
the
whole

oh

also
these

to
the
harbingers
they
work

and
the

is
filled
with
foreboding
dawn
drying
dishes
oh
um
we're
out
of
raisin
bran
i'll
put
it
on

introductions

you
gentle
viewers
amanda
standing
in
front
of
andrew
she
waves
and
talks
into
the
camera
i'm
amanda
and
i
grew
up
right
here—
andrew
looks
up
from
the
camera
not
you
sweetheart
andrew
mouths
sorry
to
amanda
let's
start
from
the
top
andrew
narrates
while
the
video
shown
is
in
a
superproduced
ultraglamorous
style
you've
already
met
buffy
andrew
vo
buffy
gracefully
pours
herself
a
bowl
of
cereal
and
shakes
her
hair
sexily
in
the
breeze
that
comes
from
nowhere
and
looks
directly
into
the
camera
she's
beautiful
with
a
lion's
heart
and—
andrew
vo
buffy
winks
and
the
face
of
an
angel
she's
never
afraid
'cause
she
knows
her
side
will
always
win
andrew
vo
a
shirtless
spike
enters
view
walking
up
to
buffy
they
look
as
if
they
will
kiss
but
don't
instead
he
touches
her
waist
and
buffy
touches
his
arms
as
they
nearly
embrace
buffy
and
spike
have
some
kind
of
history—you
can
feel
the
heat
between
them
although
technically
as
a
vampire
he's
room
temperature
andrew
vo
flits
sexily
into
view
crossing
in
front
of
spike
and
buffy
twirling
and
eating
from
a
bunch
of
grapes
then
smiling
into
the
camera
anya
a
feisty
waif
with
a
firey
temper
and
a
vulnerable
heart
that
she
hides
even
from
herself
andrew
vo
camera
pans
over
to
a
blonde
girl
eating
from
a
bowl
of
cereal
this
lovely
girl—i
don't
remember
her
name—
buffy
to
xander
oh
for
god's
sake
is
he
doing
that
again
can't
we
make
him
stop
i
don't
know
if
we
save
the
world
it
will
be
kind
of
nice
to
have
a
record
of
it
rona
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
if
we
don't
save
the
world
then
nothing
matters
kennedy
pauses
in
her
breakfast
spoon
still
in
hand
that's
catchy
amanda
let's
make
that
our
slogan
yeah
it
is
kinda
strange
how
you
keep
saving
the
world
and
there's
not
any
proof
yeah
you
know
for
future
generations
and
it
does
help
the
girls
with
training—you
know
viewing
the
tapes
come
on
no
one
else
thinks
this
is
idiotic
or
is
it
important
i
mean
buff
i
don't
get
why
this
is
bothering
you
so
much
because
it's
a
waste
of
time
come
on
someone
has
to
agree
with
me
spike
long
as
you're
not
pointing
that
thing
at
me
seems
like
a
fine
way
to
keep
the
boy
busy
this
isn't
about
keeping
busy
this
is
about
war
i'm
sorry
to
jump
all
over
you
guys
but
i
have
to
tell
you
what's
really
going
on
there's
something
new
buffy
andrew
walks
around
behind
buffy
amanda
dawn—you're
gonna
stay
home
from
school
today
we
can
survive
what's
coming
but
not
like
this
buffy
andrew
goes
into
the
dining
room
but
buffy
continues
talking
i
had
a
vision
of
what's
to
come—a
horrible
vision
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
cut

day
while
buffy
talks
in
the
other
room
andrew
sets
the
video
camera
on
the
dining
room
table
and
talks
to
it
honestly
gentle
viewers

motivating
speeches
of
hers

to
get
a
little
long
i'll
take
you
back
in
there
in—in
a
little
while
but
in
the
inbetween
time
i
thought
you
might
want
to
know
a
little
about
me
your
humble
host
you
see
i
am
a
man
with
a
burden
a
man
with
a
dark
past

andrew

tie
is
talking
to
geeky
jonathan
and
warren
who
are
dressed
in
jeans
and
tshirts
and
protective
eye
goggles
thus
the
validity
of
the
bronsteddebyehuckel
equation
at
low
ionic
strength
has
been
amply
tested
and
the
charges
on
the
reactant
ions
are
wellknown
if
their
reagents
are
properly
characterized
jonathan
looks
at
andrew
it
smells
funny
andrew
looks
at
jonathan
know
kinda
sweaty
andrew
looks
at
the
camera
squints
all
three
men
turn
around
at
once
warren
and
jonathan
flank
andrew
what'll
it
do
to
buffy

emphatically
with
two
fists
wow
she
won't
be
able
to
get
out
of
her
car
and
knives
and
other
sharp
things
will
fly
at
her
warren
gestures
like
the
knives
we
could
walk
right
by
her
and
she
wouldn't
be
able
to
stop
us
warren
takes
off
his
goggles
looks
worried
unless
we
were
wearing
metal
belt
buckles
then
we
would
stick
to
her
in
my
plan
we
are
beltless
jonathan
takes
off
goggles
wow
you're
the
best
andrew
andrew
looks
sexily
into
the
camera
as
warren
and
jonathan
fawn
over
him
yep
and
goodlooking
and
smart
too
yeah
wow
andrew
looking
into
the
camera
warren
was
cool
and
wasn't
jonathan
just
the
cutest
thing
well

we
see
if
buffy's

camera
toward
the
kitchen
buffy's
back
is
in
view
and
willow
can
be
seen
facing
buffy
willow
yawns
i
mean
mentally
and
from
what
i've
seen
so
far
there's
is
no
way
your
girls
are
ready
you
have
to
she's
not
done
even
willow
looks
bored
and
she
usually
can
take
a
lot
of
that
stuff
look
at
her
andrew
kennedy
walks
up
to
willow
and
cuddles
while
buffy's
talking
ooh
ooh
do
you
see
that
thatthat's
important
willow
and
kennedy
have
been
in
kind
of
a
bad
place
lately
but
things
are
looking
up
you
see
kennedy
pursued
the
reluctant
willow
and
won
her
heart
only
to
find
herself
frightened
when
she
glimpsed
the
darkness
that
still
lies
within
the
witch's
mind
side
note—i
once
had
my
own
personal
encounter
with

toward
jonathan
and
andrew
and

light
shoots
out
of
her
palms
toward
them
a
panicked
jonathan
hides
behind
cool
calm
andrew
jonathan
screams
in
fright
yee
haltem

effective
counter
spell

area
only
to
see
principal
wood
standing
next
to
the
front
desk
holding
an
ice
pack
to
his
head
something
bad
is
going
on
oh
is
that
right
buffy
sits
ooh
you're
hurt
what
happened
someone
threw
a
rock
at
me
as
i
got
out
of
my
car
i
didn't
really
get
a
good
chance
to
see
who
buffy
takes
a
bandage
from
the
firstaid
kit
on
the
desk
and
unwraps
it
yeah
well
it
could
have
been
any
of
them
students
teachers—something
is
going
on
today
yes
well
um
that
occurred
to
me
as
i
ducked
the
other
two
rocks
buffy
what
the
hell
is
this
buffy
puts
the
bandage
on
wood's
brow
everything
slowly
i
may
be
concussed
here
buffy
shakes
her
head
there
this
thing
that
happens
here
in
this
school
over
the
hell
mouth
where
the
way
a
thing
feels—it
kind
of
starts
being
that
wayfor
real
i've
seen
all
these
things
beforejust
not
all
at
once
so
what
it's
like
hell's

bustin'

andrew
standing

nodding
so
what's
the
worst
that
can
happen
war
pretty
much
oh
i
see
you're
being
amusing
now
with
comical
exaggeration
being
in
high
school
can
feel
like
being
at
war
now
it's
true
the
students
feel
like
the
teachers
are
out
to
get
them
the
chess
club
resents
the
french
club
for
taking
the
activities
room
and
well
everybody
hates
the
cheerleaders
if
we
don't
do
something
about
this
we're
gonna
have
a
riot
on
our
hands
and
a
lot
of
other
nasty
stuff
too
like
what
a
boy
in
the
hallway
screams
increasingly
louder
until
he
explodes

residue
splattered

you

swim
team
monsters

not

so
what
makes
now
so
special
my
guess—it's
that
seal
thing
in
the
basement
it's
like
all
the
hellmouth's
energy
is
trying
to
escape
in
that

right
i

now
we

move
on
sure
cut

wonder
what's
keeping
'em
i
thought
they'd
be
up
here
by
now
spike
picks
up
a
2x4
with
a
dozen
nails
sticking
out
of
it
how'd
they
make
this
in
here
you
suppose
spike
tosses
it
to
robin
wood
shop
i
guess
it's
nice
to
know
they're
paying
attention
in
class
some
kids
jump
spike
and
wood
starting
a
fight
while
fighting
them
off
wood
splinters
the
2x4
breaking
a
shard
off
of
it
wood
picks
up
the

fragment
and
eyes

it

at

night
the

glowing
buffy
fights
off
the
new
bringers
in
the
basement
andrew
grabs
the
camcorder
to
videotape
the
fight
andrew
narrating
she's
like
a
woman
fighting
for
more
than
life
she
fights
like
fighting
is
her
life
it's
like
the
air
she
breathes
and
she
knows
she
will
win
because
there
is
no
alternative
buffy
knocks
out
the
last
bringer
it's
your
turn
andrew
buffy
pulls
out
the
knife
and
walks
toward
andrew
andrew
walks
away
from
buffy
around
the
seal
so
you
figure
what
i
uh
andrew
puts
down
the
camcorder
i
stand
on
the
seal
and
hold
the
knife
and
command
it
to
stop
glowing
in
tawarick
buffy
and
andrew
are
opposite
each
other
across
the
seal
they
are
walking
in
circles
as
buffy
tries
to
approach
andrew
he
tries
to
maintain
his
distance
or
we
could
do
this
what
doesn't
really
make
sense
does
it
bringing
you
here
to
talk
to
it
this
thing
doesn't
understand
words
it
understands
blood
andrew
nervous
blood
opens
it
you
don't
want
to
open
it
opening
it
would
be
bad
buffy
flips
the
knife
yeah
willow
did
a
little
research
turns
out
the
blood
of
the
person
that
awoke
it—you—different
kind
of
deal
it
reverses
the
whole
thing
so
how
much
bloodare
you
gonna—
i
don't
know
maybe
not
enough
to
kill
you
andrew
faces
her
but
still
backs
away
so
this
is
my
redemption
at
last
i
buy
back
my
bruised
soul
with
the
blood
of
my
heart
butbut
not
enough
to
kill—
buffy
standing
right
in
front
of
him
now
pointing
the
knife
at
him
stop
stop
telling
stories
life
isn't
a
story
andrew
frightened
sorry
sorry
shut
up
you
always
do
this
you
make
everything
into
a
story
so
no
one's
responsible
for
anything
because
they're
just
following
a
script
please
don't
kill
me
warren
said
jonathan
would
be
ok
i
trusted
him
and
i
lost
my
friend
buffy
angrily
you
didn't
lose
him
you
murdered
him
andrew
softly
sincerely
i
know
but
you
don't
need
to
kill
me
you
said
we
could
all
get
through
this
i
made
it
up
i'm
making
it
all
up
what
kind
of
hero
does
that
make
me
andrew
shakes
his
head
no
you're
doing
great
really
kudos
yeah
well
i
don't
like
having
to
give
a
bunch
of
speeches
about
how
we're
all
gonna
live
because
we
won't
this
isn't
some
story
where
good
triumphs
because
good
triumphs
good
people
are
going
to
die
girls
maybe
me
probably
you
probably
right
now
andrew
shakes
his
head
frightened
don't
please
don't
please
buffy
pushes
him
toward
the
seal
he
leans
over
it
but
she's
holding
the
back
of
his
jacket
so
he
doesn't
fall
she's
pointing
the
knife
at
him
when
your
blood
pours
out
it
might
save
the
world
what
do
you
think
about
that
does
it
buy
it
all
back
are
you
redeemed
andrew
crying
no
why
not
andrew
sobbing
his
face
is
tearstreaked
because
i
killed
him
because
i
listened
to
warren
and
i
pretended
i
thought
it
was
him
but
i
knew—i
knew
it
wasn't
and
i
killed
jonathan
and
now
you're
gonna
kill
me
and
i'm
scared
and
i'm
going
to
die
and
this—this
is
what
jonathan
felt
as
andrew's
tears
flow
a
tear
droplet
falls
from
his
face
onto
the
seal
below
it
immediately
stops
glowing
buffy
lets
andrew
go
he
falls
to
the
ground
and
puts
the
knife
down
it
stopped
didn't
want
blood

wanted
tears
andrew
stands

had
to—
you—you
weren't
really
going
to
stab
me

you
i
wasn't
going
