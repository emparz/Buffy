buffy's

night
dawn
is
helping
willow
unpack
her
things
she's
moving
in
to
buffy's
old
room
my
advice
to
you
is
do
exactly
what
everyone
else
does
all
the
time
got
it
do
what
everyone
else
does
wear
what
everyone
else
wears
say
what
everyone
else
says
ok
dawn
people
may
say
something
to
you
you
don't
understand
just
don't
be
afraid
to
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
pretend
like
you
know
what
they're
saying
willow
laughs
you
know
dawn
i've
been
to
college
before
people
may
say
something
like
my
protein
window
closes
in
an
hour
just
nod
and
smile
mmhmm
turns
out
it
has
something
to
do
with
fitness
buffy
and
xander
enter
the
room
carrying
boxes
have
you
talked
to
her
lately
not
since
that
night
with
the
gnarl
demon
and
that
wasn't
exactly
the
kind
of
how
have
you
been
kind
of
talk
more
of
the
pierce
its
eye
with
something
sharp
kind
of
talking
i'm
thinking
i
should
call
her
i
just
don't
want
you
to
get
your
hopes
up
hopes
oh
no
no
no
no
no
there
are
no
hopes
anya
and
i
are
done
i
love
being
single
i'm
a
strong
successful
male
who
is
giddy
at
the
thought
of
all
the
women
i
will
no
doubt
be
dating
in
the
near
future
strong
successful
males
say
giddy
i
just
worry
about
her
that's
all
anya
yeah
she
seems
so
sad
she
should
try
acting
like
everybody
else
more
apparently
it's
what
all
the
kids
are
doing
nowadays
well
i'm
not
sure
i
get
the
sad
vibe
but
there's
definitely
a
vengeance
vibe
worth
worrying
about
oh
that
no
no
i
don't
worry
about
that
she
was
hurt
and
she
just
turned
back
to
what
she
knew
when
i—
you
know
but
that's
not
her
anymore
i
hope
you're
right
well
she
turned
that
worm
guy
back
before
any
real
damage
happened
right
it'll
just
take
some
time
i
really
think
she's

here—drink
your

first
ah
yes
mead
the

of

given
me
an
idea
i
can
give
the
excess
out
to
the
townspeople
exchanging
them
not
for
goods
or
services
but
for
goodwill
and
the
sense
of
accomplishment
that
stems
from
selflessly
giving

yourself
to
others

your
logic
is
insane

like

int
woods
in
sunnydale
day
buffy
and
xander
are
walking
through
the
woods
on
a
trail
looking
for
the
spider
demon
xander
is
carrying
a
sword
and
buffy
has
her
battleaxe
thanks
for
sidekicking
i
didn't
want
to
trouble
willow
figure
she's
got
enough
to
do
first
day
back
and
all
are
you
kidding
we're
doing
vent
work
at
the
site
anything's
better
than
breathing
freon
for
eight
hours
xander
beat
so
did
she
say
what
this
thing
is
some
sort
of
spider
demony
thingy
she
had
to
go
pretty
quickly
i
think
she
had
to
sign
up
for
classes
or
something
ah
yes
there
is
little
that
can
distract
the
willow
when
she's
on
the
hunt
for
the
mighty
syllabi
i
don't
know
i
guess
she
was
a
little
more
nervous
than
she
was
letting
on
they
stumble
across
a
boy's
body
the
heart
has
been
ripped
out
xander
starts
hyperventilating
how
big
did
she
say
this
thing
was
she
didn't
but
i
can't
imagine
she'd
send
us
out
if
it
wasn't—
the
heart
is
completely
ripped
out
this
is
our
guy
or
a
copycat
spider
demon
so
what's
this
black
stuff
there's
black
stringy
things
hanging
on
the
nearby
tree
xander
touches
it
aw
it's
sticky
willow
said
it
was
a
spider
demon
maybe
it's
its
webbing
this
isn't
springy
highflying
fun
a
noise
comes
from
the
tree
above
them
like
something's
moving
around
in
it
buffy
looking
up
xander
is
that
it
i
can't
tell
there
is
definitely
something
moving
up
there
maybe
we
can
somehow
lure
it
one
of
the
sticky
black
webs
is
shot
down
from
the
tree
landing
on
xander's
shoulder
he
dives
out
of
the
way
xander
the
spider
jumps
out
of
the
tree
knocks
buffy
down
to
the
ground
and
lands
on
top
of
her
she
squirms
but
can't
get
free
as
the
spider
demon's
second
mouth
comes
out
to
try
and
bite
her
face
she
pushes
it
off
and
it
scurries
away
she
grabs
her
battleaxe
off
the
ground
and
looks
up
in
the
tree
for
the
spider
demon
you
ok
buffy
where'd
it
go
i
think
we
need
more
swords
buffy
still
looking
up
into
the
tree
uhhuh
i
say
we
go
home
pick
up
more
swords
and
some
sort
of
spidery
demon
protection
amulet
we
come
back
and—
buffy
who
has
never
stopped
tracking
the
spider
demon
in
the
tree
throws
her
battleaxe
up
into
the
treetop
the
spider
falls
to
the
ground
with
the
axe
in
it
or—

day
xander
and
buffy
come
home
covered
in
huge
scrapes
and

i'm
more
concerned
with
where
that
thing
came
from
if
there
are
more
of
those
spider
demons
running
around
we
need
to
know
about
it
we
should
hit
the
research
find
out
if—
buffy
and
xander
walk
into
the
living
room
to
see
willow
is
waiting
for
them
i
know
where
it
came

how

you
not
have
told
me
xander
it's
ok
she
didn't
tell

int

room
at
buffy's
house
day
resume
conversation
about
buffy
killing
anya
xander
willow
and
buffy
are
talking
she's
not
the
anya
that
you
knew
xander
she's
a
demon
that
doesn't
mean
you
have
to
kill
her
don't
act
like
this
is
easy
for
me
you
know
it's
not
there
are
other
options
i've
considered
them
when
just
now
took
you
all
of
ten
seconds
to
decide
to
kill
one
of
your
best
friends
the
thought
that
it
might
come
to
this
has
occurred
to
me
before
it's
occurred
to
you
too
but
we
can
change
what
she
did
fix
it
these
are
mystical
deaths
right
there
has
to
be
something
i
don't
have
anywhere
near
that
kind
of
power
i
didn't
have
that
kind
of
power
when—
and
ii
don't
think
i
trust
the
power
i
do
have
buffy
to
willow
it's
ok
buffy
turns
to
xander
xander
i
know
this
is
hard
for
you
to
hear
but
it's
what
i
have
to
do
hard
for
me
to
hear
buffy
you
wanna
kill
anya
i
don't
want
to
then
don't
this
isn't
new
ground
for
us
when
our
friends
go
all
crazy
and
start
killing
people
we
help
them
xander
looks
at
willow
sitting
right
here
i'm
sorry
but
it's
true
it's
different
because
you
don't
care
about
her
the
same
way
i
do
buffy
i
still
love
her
i
know
and
that's
why
you
can't
see
this
for
what
it
really
is
willow
was
different
she's
a
human
anya's
a
demon
and
you're
the
slayer
i
see
now
how
it's
all
very
simple
it
is
never
simple
xander
stands
no
of
course
not
you
know
if
there's
a
massmurdering
demon
that
you're
oh
say
boning
then
it's
all
gray
area
spike
was
harmless
he
was
helping
he
had
no
choice
and
anya
did
she
chose
to
become
a
demon
twice
you
have
no
idea
what
she's
going
through
buffy
stands
i
don't
care
what
she's
going
through
no
of
course
not
you
think
we
haven't
seen
all
this
before
the
part
where
you
just
cut
us
all
out
just
step
away
from
everything
human
and
act
like
you're
the
law
if
you
knew
what
i
felt—
i
killed
angel
do
you
even
remember
that
i
would
have
given
up
everything
i
had
to
be
with—
i
loved
him
more
than
i
will
ever
love
anything
in
this
life
and
i
put
a
sword
through
his
heart
because
i
had
to
and
that
all
worked
out
ok
do
you
remember
cheering
me
on
both
of
you
do
you
remember
giving
me
willow's
message
kick
his
ass
i
never
said
that—
this
is
different—
it
is
always
different
it's
always
complicated
and
at
some
point
someone
has
to
draw
the
line
and
that
is
always
going
to
be
me
you
get
down
on
me
for
cutting
myself
off
but
in
the
end
the
slayer
is
always
cut
off
there's
no
mystical
guidebook
no
allknowing
council
human
rules
don't
apply
there's
only
me
i
am
the
law
there
has
to
be
another
way
then
please
find
it

buffy
has
just
stabbed
anya
through
the
heart
with
her
sword
anya
in
human
face
is
slumped
but
hasn't
fallen
xander
regains
consciousness
and
is
still
on
the
floor
he
looks
over
and
sees
anya's
condition
anya
anya
face
is
tearstreaked
and
bloody
suddenly
she
gasps
for
air
and
opens
her
eyes
she
looks
down
at
the
sword
in
her
chest
forgotten
how
much
swords
through
the
chest
hurt
anya
pulls
it
out
aaahh
anya
breathes
heavily
you
know
better
than
that
buffy
it
takes
a
lot
more
to
kill
a
vengeance
demon
oh
i'm
just
getting
started
anya
comes
at
buffy
with
the
sword
buffy
pushes
a
stool
at
her
knocking
her
off
balance
she
falls
to
the
floor
dropping
the
sword
anya's
lying
with
her
back
on
the
floor
buffy
takes
the
sword
straddles
anya
and
prepares
for
another
thorough
doublefisted
stabbing
of
anya
xander
pushes
buffy
out
of
the
way
they
all
stand
up
stop
trying
to
save
me
xander
lightening
bolts
flash
in
the
room
knocking
everyone
down
then
d'hoffryn
appears
oh
please
don't
mind
me
continue
with
whatever
it
was
you
were
doing
d'hoffryn
walks
to
look
in
an
adjacent
room
oh
breathtaking
it's
like
somebody
slaughtered
an
abercrombie
and
fitch
catalog
d'hoffryn
buffy
stands
and
grabs
her
sword
easy
now
i'd
be
gone
before
you
could
swing
d'hoffryn
sighs
offers
a
hand
to
anya
to
help
her
stand
isn't
that
just
like
a
slayer
solving
all
her
problems
by
sticking
things
with
sharp
objects
i
talked
to
your
friend
miss
rosenberg
she's
a
firebrand
i
have
high
hopes
for
her
stay
away
from
willow
d'hoffryn
to
anya
oh
he's
gallant
isn't
he
i
understand
what
you
saw
in
him
d'hoffryn
to
all
look
miss
rosenberg
seems
to
think
anyanka
would
be
better
suited
outside
the
vengeance
fold
i
think
we
already
know
what
lady
hacksaway
wants
and
the
young
man
he
sees
with
the
eyeballs
of
love
but
i'm
not
sure
if
anyone's
bothered
to
find
out
what
anyanka
herself
really
wants
her
name
is
anya
actually
funny
historical
sidebar
her
original
name
was—
anya
crying
i
wanna
take
it
back
i'm
sorry
what
was
that
i
wanna
take
it
back
i
wanna
undo
what
i
did
hmm
you
want
to
take
it
back
must
be
twelve
bodies
in
there
such
a
thing—not
easily
done
but
not
impossible
you're
a
big
girl
anyanka
you
understand
how
this
works
the
proverbial
scales
must
balance
in
order
to
restore
the
lives
of
the
victims
the
fates
require
a
sacrifice
the
life
and
soul
of
a
vengeance
demon
do
it
wait
stay
out
of
this
xander
ok
all
right
that
seems
smart
he
just
said
you
have
to
die
perhaps
there's
some
sort
of
alternate
price
xander
you
can't
help
me
i'm
not
even
sure
there's
a
me
to
help
anya
to
d'hoffryn
i
understand
the
price
do
it
you're
sure
this
is
your
wish
this
is
my
wish
undo
what
i
did
very
well
d'hoffryn
gestures
with
his
hands
and
a
flash
of
light
appears
no
where
the
flash
was
halfrek
shows
up
smiling
sweetly
anya
anya
looks
at
d'hoffryn
realizing
what's
going
to
happen
hallie
halfrek
bursts
into
flames
and
light
shoots
out
of
her
eyes
she
shrieks
and
disappears
anya
starts
to
cry
as
d'hoffryn
berates
her
who
did
you
think
you
were
dealing
with
did
you
think
it
would
be
that
easy
to
get
away
why
why
because
you
wished
it
but
she
was
yours
like
you
were
mine
haven't
i
taught
you
anything
anya
never
go
for
the
kill
when
you
can
go
for
the
pain
d'hoffryn
xander
starts
for
d'hoffryn
but
buffy
stops
him
hold
him
back
slayer
wouldn't
want
anyone
to
get
hurt
i've
got
plenty
of
girls

vengeance
demons
but
now

things
in
time
in
a
flash
d'hoffryn
disappears

looks
at
xander
and
buffy
and
walks
out
buffy
to
xander

along
well
speaking
as
a
clingee—
i
kinda
didn't
mind
thanks
for
everything
xander
nods
realizing
that
this
is
her
rejecting
his
offer
to
help
xander—
what
if
i'm
really
nobody

be
a
dope

a
dope
