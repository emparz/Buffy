way
then
helps
the
vampire
up
buffy
drops
her
crossbow
and
joins

riley
rolls
and
comes
up

buffy
running
her
hands
down
his
arms
major
clashing
buffy

riley

fall
onto
the
bed
opening
credits

camera
pans
slowly
across
the
lobby
of
lowell
house
darkened
we
see
chairs
couches
fireplace
pan
up
the
stairs
and
across
the
landing
to
the
door
of
riley's
room
cut
to
inside
the
room
riley
and
buffy
asleep
snuggling
riley
wakes
up
looks
at
buffy
kisses
her
shoulder
gets
out
of
bed
creepy
music
sounds
like
the
same
music
in
hush
riley
puts
on
pants
and
leaves
closing
the
door
quietly
he
hears
a
rattling
noise
and
looks
around
looks
downstairs
walks
slowly
through
the
dark
halls
toward
a
door
shot
of
the
doorknob
and
his
hand
grasping
it
he
opens
the
door
and
walks
into
a
bathroom
turns
on
the
light
the
noise
continues
camera
pans
through
the
bathroom
sinks
toilet
stalls
bathtub
with
the
shower
curtain
pulled
shut
riley
looks
around
the
bathroom
approaches
the
tub
slowly
he
yanks
back
the
shower
curtain
there's
nothing
there
except
a
drippy
faucet
riley
makes
a
face
and
turns
it
off
he
stands
there
looking
at
it
as
cheerful
music
starts
cut
to
an
icecream
truck
driving
down
the
street
daylight
making
cheery
music
cut
to
xander
driving
the
truck
wearing
a
redandwhite
striped
shirt
and
matching
hat
anya
sitting
next
to
him
aw
come
on
big
party
at
riley's
house
it's
gonna
be
fun
why
don't
you
wanna
go
xander
he
stops
the
truck
you
know
why
not
those
initiative
men
make
me
not
comfortable
and
you
don't
care
they
don't
even
know
that
you're
an
exdemon
and
we
don't
know
that
they'd
care
even
if
they
did
know
which
by
the
way
they're
not
gonna
find
out
xander
gets
up
and
goes
into
back
of
truck
to
set
up
anyways
they'll
probably
be
too
busy
flirting
with
every
other
girl
at
the
party
to
even
notice
you
so
you
don't
think
i'm
desirable
enough
to
be
flirted
with
xander
looks
surprised
is
that
it
i'm
just
not
gonna
win
here
am
i
anya
sighs
accusingly
you
don't
find
me
attractive
anymore
what
are
you
talking
about
i
think
you're
gorgeous
oh
really
well
then
why
didn't
we
have
sex
last
night
xander
looks
up
is
that
what
this
is
about
we've
gone
other
nights
without
sex
anya
angry
i
know
twice
i
can't
believe
we're
breaking
up
breaking
we're
not
are
we
of
course
we
are
you
you've
obviously
grown
tired
of
me
i
mean
i've
seen
it
happen
to
thousands
of
women
over
the
centuries
i
just
never
thought
it
would
happen
to
me
anya
there's
a
lot
more
to
you
and
me
than
the
sex
xander
anya
rolls
her
eyes
well
there
should
be
i
mean
a
relationship
is
something
that
you
work
at
work
through
together
i
don't
understand
i'm
pretty
i'm
young
i
mean
anya
stands
up
walks
closer
why
didn't
you
take
advantage
of
me
is
something
wrong
with
your
body
xander
getting
mad
there's
nothing
wrong
with
my
body
well
there
must
be
i
saw
that
wrinkled
man
on
tv
talking
about
erectile
dysfunction
whoa
hey
xander
chuckles
nervously
all
systems
go
here
xander
gesturing
at
his
crotch
no
function
problem
okay
anya
looks
skeptical
xander
claps
his
hands
starts
unbuttoning
his
shirt
you
want
sex
let's
have
sex
right
here
hot
sweaty
big
sex
camera
angle
changes
so
we
see
into
the
truck
from
the
perspective
of
the
customer
window
in
the
side
of
the
truck
xander's
hands
stop
moving
his
and
anya's
heads
turn
together
shot
of
a
group
of
kids
and
parents
staring
up
at
them
shot
of
xander
and
anya
giving
false
smiles
there's
always
been
great
discord
between
them
cut
to
giles
holding
a
rolledup
piece
of
paper
and
yet
you
say
that
the
the
vampire
went
to
the
demon's
aid
the
two
of
them
were
working
as
a
team
buffy
sitting
on
riley's
lap
nods
everything
except
giving
each
other
little
pats
on
the
behind
we
see
the
interior
of
a
college
lounge
room
buffy
and
riley
in
one
chair
giles
on
their
right
willow
and
tara
on
the
sofa
across
from
them
extraordinarily
odd
giles
sits
back
crosses
his
legs
gestures
with
the
paper
as
a
rule
demons
have
no
empathy
for
any
of
the
species
other
than
their
own
shot
of
buffy
and
riley
giving
each
other
affectionate
looks
in
fact
most
think
of
giles
sees
someone
walking
by
lowers
his
voice
vampires
as
abominations
mixing
with
human
blood
and
all
so
what
brought
these
two
together
not
what
who
giles
realizing
adam
giles
pulls
off
his
glasses
think
about
it
who
better
to
bring
together
a
bunch
of
demon
types
than
someone
who's
made
out
of
a
bunch
of
demon
types
so
he's
um
bridging
the
gap
between
the
races
huh
like
martin
luther
king
shot
of
giles
raising
his
eyebrows
skeptically
um
giles
clears
throat
i
suggest
that
uh
over
the
next
several
nights
you
two
giles
looks
at
buffy's
and
riley's
hands
stroking
each
other
concentrate
your
patrol
in
that
same
area
if
there's
any
other
peculiar
pairings
or
groupings
you
let
me
know
i'll
let
the
squad
know
as
well
they're
patrolling
riley
to
buffy
we'll
have
a
uh
reserve
unit
out
during
the
party
giles

a
time

idea
was
that

pretty
ragged
need
to
let
off
steam
giles
nods
point
taken

welcome
to
come
well
much

a
good
kegger

other
plans
the
espresso
pump

embarrassed
buffy
and
riley
exchange
another
amorous
look
more
hand
stroking
what
are
you
doing
there
i'm
um
uh
it's
a
a
meeting
of

grownups

interest

tara
quickly
xander
was
just
talking
about
anya
buffy

pretty
glad

that
a
certain
exdemon

have
any
powers
buffy's
attention
is
gone
again
staring
over

of
the
couch
almost
touching
her
yeah

with
my
thoughts

i
can
barely
hurt
his
feelings
anya
sighs
things
used
to
be
so
much
simpler
spike
wistfully
you
know
you
take
the
killing
for
granted
anya
nods
nostalgically
and
then
it's
gone
and
you're
like
i
wish
i'd
appreciated

a
thousand
relationships

the
love
and

vengeance

deserted

pans
across

and
up
the
stairs
to
riley's
door
just
like

only
now
the
vines
cover
the
entire

and
much
of
the
ceiling
and

nearby
muffled
howling
and
screeching
noises
cut
to
buffy
and
riley
in

they
let
go
of

buffy
panting
you
have
to
keep
touching
me
buffy
rolls
over
and
starts
kissing
him
again
moaning
panting
cut
to
the
college
library
giles
pacing
while
the
others
sit
at
a
table
when
you
called
to
buffy
and
riley
they
didn't
cry
out
or
or
respond
in
any
way
anya
bored
no
they're
probably
dead
unless
they're
too
busy
doin'
it
to
answer
doing
what
giles
sits
at
the
table
across
from
xander
you
know
for
a
god
of
acoustic
rock
you're
kind
of
naive
giles
rolls
his
eyes
i
didn't
think
you
meant
in
the
midst
of
all
that
do
you
really
think
they
were
keeping
it
up
everyone
looks
at
him
oh
for
a
different
phrasing
well
see
that's
the
thing
people
all
over
the
party
were
starting
to
act
weird
willow
quietly
sexually
in
what
way
you
know
willow
embarrassed
ways
willow
looking
through
an
old
book
well
it
could
be
some
form
of
uh
succubi
or
a
satyr's
prank
it
could
even
be
energy
coming
from
the
the
lab
underneath
the
lowell
fraternity
it
wasn't
always
a
fraternity
look
they
all
come
to
look
at
her
book
willow
reading
between
1949
and
1960
the
lowell
home
for
children
housed
upwards
of
40
adolescents
runaways
juvenile
delinquents
and
emotionally
disturbed
teenagers
from
the
sunnydale
area
children
did
any
of
them
um
die
in
there
if
there
were
deaths
then
uh
perhaps
we're
dealing
with
a
fairly
standard
haunting
it
doesn't
say
it's
mostly
about
the
old
house
director
genevieve
holt
sunnydale
children's
aid
30
years
of
community
service
giving
disadvantaged
kids
the
love
and
care
they
deserve
when
did
she
die
willow
looks
at
book

don't
understand
wewell
um
like
uh
furniture
moving
of
its
own
accord
or
uh
objects
appearing
out
of
nowhere
or
or
perhaps
you
saw
someone
appear
one
moment
and
then
they
were
gone
the
next
iinexplicably
why
that
sounds
like
crazy
talk
yes
it
does
doesn't
it
yes
um
giles
looks
at
xander
and
anya
well
forgive
me
for
for
asking

any
of
them
ever
ill
or
did
anything
ever
happen
to
any
of
them
well
some
had
the
flu
and
such
no
one
died
if

engraving
on
the
medal
says
how
good
i
was
with
the
children
mrs
holt
smiles
giles
smiles
oh
yes
i
treated
them
as
i
would
my
own
flesh
and
blood
gave
them
hugs
and
praise
when
they
were
good
and
punished
them
when
they
were
dirty
well
ah
children
will
be
children
they
you
know
they
do
like
to
play
in
the
uh
the
muck
giles
smiling
mrs
holt
looks
disapproving
you
didn't
mean
mud
dirty
my
kids
didn't
think
i
knew
but
i
did
giles
starting
to
understand
very
uh
perceptive
of
you
without
me
they
would
have
been
shut
out
of
the
kingdom
lost
to
lust
but
you
helped
them
the
girls
felt
the
vanity
more
than
the
boys
i'd
see
them
preening
like
jezebel
doting
over
their
pretty
hair
so
you'd
hack
it
off
i'd
remove
the
temptation
to
admire
themselves
giles
removes
his
glasses
they
were
better
for
it
what
about
the
bathtub
something
happened
there
i
performed
baptisms
on
the
most
unclean
those
who
were
tainted
with
impure
thought
and
deed
you
held
them
under
they
needed
to
be
reborn
mrs
holt
rises
you
choose
to
pass
judgment
on
me
giles
rises
well
someone
ought
to
you
traumatized
and
giles
she
waves
her
hand
dismissively
and
abused
these
children
children
who
who
have
no
doubt
become
extremely
disturbed
adults
she
starts
to
walk
away
he
pursues
her
you
have
ruined
lives
mrs
holt
furthermore
what
you
did
has
now
manifested
itself
as
a
a
malevolent
presence
which
threatens
still
more
lives
you
have
a
great
deal
to
answer
for
i
refuse
to
listen
to
this
when
i
can
smell
the
sin
on
each
and
every
one
of
you
mrs
holt
points
to
them
all
yeah
you
smell
sin
well
let
me
tell
you
something
lady
she
who
smelt
it
dealt
it
giles

him
it's

what
you
said

faster
cut

them
leaving

apartment
well
that
totally
adds
to
my
old
people
are
crazy
theorem
i
don't
get
it
i
mean
those
kids
were
tortured
but
they
weren't
killed
so
where
are
those
ghosts
coming
from
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
ghosts
one
ran
right
through
me
not
a
ghost
an
apparition
i
believe
we're
dealing
with
a
kind
of
poltergeist
a
whole
cluster
of
them
in
fact
born
out
of
intense
adolescent
emotion
and
sexual
energy
both
of
which
were
totally
pentup
during
mrs
holt's
reign
of
repression
so
with
buffy
and
riley
having
you
know
acts
of
nakedness
around
the
clock
lately
maybe
they
set
something
free
like
a
big
burstin'
poltergasm
yes
and
now
the
poltergeists
are
drawing
more
and
more
energy
out
of
them
feeding
on
them
in
fact
buffy
and
riley
are
are
powering
this
whole
thing
