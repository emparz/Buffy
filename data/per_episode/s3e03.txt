that

scott
walks
off
to
find
a
place
to
wait
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
and
flops
her
head
back
mentally
kicking
herself
for
the
way
she
handled
that
willow
very
disappointed
come
on

charm
aand

cordelia
and
xander
walk
up
check
out
slutorama
and
her
disco
dave
she
points
and
looks
onto
the
dance
floor
as
she
and
xander
sit
on
a
low
table
against
a
wall
the
camera
cuts
to
the
energetically
dancing
couple
although
the
girl's
style
is
more
contemporary
the
guy
is
dancing
way
too
fast
for
the
music
with
an
unmistakable
70's
disco
influence
what
was
the
last
thing
that
guy
danced
to
kc
and
the
sunshine
band
willow
and
oz
both
cock
their
heads
to
look
at
them
you
can't
love
me
or
anyone
else
the
couple
continues
to
dance
getting
close
and
touching
each
other
at
one
point
then
separating
again
you
said
i
was
the
best
thing
in
your
life
buffy
begins
to
really
wonder
about
them
the
couple
gets
close
again
and
the
girl
extends
her
arm
pointing
at
the
door
the
guy
takes
the
hint
and
leads
her
out
with
his
arm
around
her
buffy
watches
them
go
suspicious
of
his
intentions
she
sees
him
say
bye
to
his
buddy
and
head
for
the
door
i
don't
think
that
guy
thrives
on
sunshine
she
quickly
puts
down
her
drink
and
starts
out
after
them
as
she
crosses
the
room
behind
the
dance
floor
scott
sees
her
coming
and
steps
over
to
intercept
her

out
right
behind
her
followed
closely
by
the
others
where'd

she
takes
a
few
steps
down
the
alley
to
the
left
to
check

probably
just
making
out
buffy
comes
back
they
hear
a
girl
call
out
in
a
complaining
tone
hey
they
also
hear
a
loud
noise
as
though
something
was
just
broken
xander
pulls
a
stake
out
of
his
jacket
buffy
takes
it
from
him
and
heads
in
the
direction
of
the
noise
that's
not
what
making
out
sounds
like
unless
i'm
doing
it
wrong
they
all
follow
buffy
cut
to
the
couple
from
the
dance
floor
the
boy

the
girl
up
against
a
section
of
temporary
chain

grabs
him
by
the
neck
pushes
him
away
a
bit
and
elbow
jabs
him
in
the
face
he
staggers
back
and
regains
his
balance
as
she
jumps
onto
a
crate
she
does
a
jumping
roundhouse
kick
to
his
face
knocking
him
to
the
pavement
buffy
arrives
the
girl
notices
her
and
approaches
smiling
it's
okay
i
got
it
you're
uh
buffy
right
buffy
is
taken
aback
just
as
she's
about
to
answer
the
vampire
comes
up
behind
the
girl
and
grabs
her
by
the
shoulders
she
snaps
her
head
back
to
head
butt
him
in
the
face
and
grabs
onto
his
arm
i'm
faith
she
twists
the
vampire
around
and
shoves
him
into
the
section
of
chain
link
fence
oz
to
willow
i'm
gonna
go
out
on
a
limb
and
say
there's
a
new
slayer
in
town
faith
knees
him
in
the
gut
from
behind
the
vamp
whirls
around
and
tries
to
backhand
punch
her
but
she
easily
ducks
it
she
punches
him
in
the
gut
and
then
again
in
the
face
everyone
just
watches
her
fight
xander
follows
her
moves
with
jerks
of
his
head
she
does
a
high
side
kick
to
the
vampire's
jaw
grabs
onto
his
shirt
and
neck
and
throws
him
to
the
ground
the
vamp
does
a
nohand
front
roll
to
control
his
fall
while
faith
reaches
over
to
buffy
for
the
stake
and
jerks
it
from
her
hand
can
i
borrow
that
the
vampire
uses
the
momentum
of
his
roll
to
get
back
to
his
feet
and
runs
at
faith
throwing
a
punch
as
he
comes
she
ducks
it
hooks
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
turns
him
around
and
pushes
him
back
into
the
fence
she
raises
the
stake
and
jams
it
cleanly
into
his
chest
and
jerks
it
back
out
the
vampire
instantly
crumbles
into
ashes
buffy
stares
in
confused
amazement
faith
faces
her
and
hands
her
back
the
stake
thanks
b
couldn't
have
done
it
without
you
she
just
continues
walking
past
them
all
buffy
turns
to
stare
after
her
unsure

the
camera
follows
a
waitress
holding
a
tray
of
six
muffins
past
the
pastry
counter
and
into
an
alcove
where
faith
has
joined
the
gang
and
is
relating
one
of
her
stories
to
them
the
whole
summer
it
was
like
the
worst
heat
wave
so
it's
about
a
hundred
and
eighteen
degrees
and
i'm
sleeping
without
a
stitch
on
the
waitress
sets
the
tray
on
a
table
and

of
a
sudden
i
hear

screaming
from
outside
so
i
go
tearing
out
stark
nude
faith
xander
looks
down
at
her
body
licking
his
lips
and
this
church
bus
has
broke
down
and
there's
these
three
vamps
feasting
faith
buffy
listens
calmly
on
half
the
baptists
in
south
boston
faith
willow
listens
intently
so
i
waste
the
vamps
and
the
preacher
comes
up
and
he's
hugging
me
like
there's
no
tomorrow
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
cops
pull
up
and
they
arrested
us
both
she
reaches
for
a
muffin
xander
stares
blankly
ahead
of
himself
trying
to
picture
the
scene
wow

should
film
that
story
and
show
it
every
christmas
cordelia
sitting
next
to
him
with
her
arms
and
legs
crossed
turns
her
head
to
him
and
gives
him
a
look
faith
tears
into
the
muffin
god

eat
a
horse

crazy
how
slayin'
just
always
makes
you
hungry
and
horny
faith
gobbles
a
piece
the
others
all
turn
their
heads
to
look
at
buffy
she
stares
back
wide
eyed
and
suddenly
uncomfortable
well
sometimes
ii
crave
a
nonfat
yogurt
afterwards
a
look
of
sudden
revelation
washes
across
cordelia's
face
and
she
smiles
i
get
it
faith
gives
her
a
confused
look
not
the
horny
thing

my
chance
to
meet
the
infamous
buff
and
compare
notes
faith
buffy
gives
her
a
little
smile
so
b
did

a
rocket
launcher
one
time
uh

buffy
leans
forward

funny
story

xander
interrupts
so
what

the
uh
story
about

and
has
another
flashback
to
stabbing
angel
in
the
chest
with
the
sword
and
his
look
of
surprise
and
pain
she
comes
back
and
shakes
herself
out
of
her
reverie
um

smiles
weakly

and
takes
a
drink

muddy
grave

be
afraid
xander
smiles
willow
nods
in
agreement
faith
grins
and
laughs
you
guys
are
a
hoot
and
a
half
if
i'd
had
friends
like
you
in
high
school
i
probably
still
would've
dropped
out
but
i
might've
been
sad
about
it
you
know
willow
and
xander
give
her
understanding
nods
and
exchange
a
smile
faith
crosses
her
arms

a
stake
to
your
throat

be
sarcasm
xander
takes

drink
scott
comes
out
of

eyes
in

off
willow
buffy

and
shuts
up
while

still
can
buffy
looks

two
of

talking
well
i
hadn't

buffy
gives
up
and
grabs
a
pair
of
tongs
to
take
some
fries
for

well
when

it's
like

away
and
i
only

one
thing
that
i'm
gonna
win
and
they're
gonna
lose
i
like
that
feelin'
faith
digs
into
her
food
joyce
smiles
at
that
and
takes
her
seat
well
sure
beats
that
dead
feeling
you
get
when
they
win
and
you
lose
i
don't
let
that
kind
of
negative
thinking
in
joyce
points
at
faith
right
joyce
shakes
her
finger
right

be
awfully
negative

joyce
smiles
buffy

into
the
kitchen
she's
really
cool
huh
best
mom

buffy
looks
back
into
the
kitchen
excuse
me
she
gets
up
and
goes
faith
grabs
a
bottle
of
hot
sauce
gives
it
a
sniff
and
grimaces
cut
to
the
kitchen
joyce
gets
out
a
bottle
of
cola
brings
it
to
the
island
and
opens
it
i
like
this
girl
buffy
joyce
pours
the

she's
very
personable
buffy
sits
on
a
stool
she
gets
along
with
my
friends
my
watcher
my
mom
buffy
leans
back
and
looks
into
the
dining
room
look
now
she's
getting
along
with
my
fries
leans
forward
joyce
closes

my
life

not
looking
to

well
there
are
some
things
i'd
be
happy
to
see
you
share
like
the
slaying
i
mean
two
of
you
fighting
is
safer
than
one
right
i
guess
unless
i
mean
you
heard
her
she
loves
the
slaying
joyce
leans
over
the
island
couldn't
she
take
over
for
you
mom
no
one
can
take
over
for
me
but
you're
going
to
college
next
year
i
think
it
would
be
mom
the
only
way
you
get
a
new
slayer
is
when
the
old
slayer
dies
this
quickly
registers
in
joyce's
mind
and
she
straightens
back
up
buffy
realizes
she's
just
said
way
too
much
then
that
means
you
joyce
upset
when
did
you
die
you
never
told
me
you
died
no
iit
was
just
for
a
few
minutes
joyce
starts
to
pace
nervously
oh
i
hate
this
i
hate
your
life
mom
i
joyce
faces
her
daughter
look
ii
know
you
didn't
choose
this
i
know
it
chose
you
joyce
takes
a
breath
i
have
tried
to
march
in
the
'slayer
pride'
parade
but
joyce
suddenly
very
solemn
i
don't
want
you
to
die
buffy
lowers
her
eyes
shakes
her
head
and
gives
her
mother
a
warm
hug
oh
i'm
not
gonna
die
i
know
how
to
do
my
job
buffy
releases
the
hug
besides
like
you
said
i've
got
help
now
she
looks
into
the
living
room
to
see
faith
picking
at
everything
in
sight
and
stuffing
it
into
her
mouth
buffy
raises
her
eyebrows
i've
got
all
the
help
i
can
stand
cut
to
an
alley
at
night
there
is
construction
equipment
lying
around
buffy
and
faith
come
strolling
along
looking
around
for
any
vampires
didn't
we
um
do
this
street
already
funny
thing
about
vamps
they'll
hit
a
street
even
after
you've
been
there
it's
like
they
have
no
manners
faith
shrugs
mm
you've
been
doing
this
the
longest
i
have
yeah
maybe
a
little
too
long
buffy
looks
at
faith
excuse
me
what's
that
supposed
to
mean
nothing
you
got
a
problem
faith
spreads
her
arms
i'm
fivebyfive
b
living
entirely
large
actually
wondering
about
faith
points
at
her
your
problem
well
i
may
not
sleep
in
the
nude
and
rassle
alligators
maybe
it's
time
you
started
'cause
obviously
something
in
your
bottle
needs
uncorking
what
is
it
faith
gestures
wildly
the
the
angel
thing
faith
keeps
looking
around
buffy
stops
in
her
tracks
what
do
you
know
about
angel
faith
faces
her
copping
an
attitude
just
what
your
friends
tell
me
big
love
big
loss
you
oughta
deal
and
move
on
but
you're
not
buffy
steps
closer
i
got
an
idea
how
about
from
now
on
we
don't
hear
from
you
on
angel
or
anything
else
in
my
life
which
by
the
way
is
my
life
what
are
you
getting
so
strung
out
for
b
why
are
your
lips
still
moving
f
did
i
just
hear
a
threat
would
you
like
to
wow
think
you
can
take
me
yeah
buffy
looks
over
faith's
shoulder
i
just
hope
they
can't
she
shoves
faith
aside
as
a
vampire
attacks
making
her
fall
to
the
ground
buffy
punches
the
vamp
in
the
gut
and
he
goes
flying
onto
his
back
a
second
one
comes
in
and
takes
a
swing
at
buffy
but
she
ducks
him
she
middle
blocks
his
wide
punch
and
low
blocks
his
next
punch
she
then
punches
him
in
the
face
and
the
gut
she
takes
his
head
in
both
hands
and
twists
his
body
follows
the
motion
and
he
log
rolls
down
to
the
ground
faith
gets
back
up
and
grabs
a
nearby
trashcan
a
third
vampire
runs
in
and
punches
buffy
in
the
face
he
goes
around
behind
her
and
trips
her
with
his
outstretched
leg
making
her
fall
to
the
ground
behind
him
faith
crams
the
trashcan
down
over
his
head
blinding
him
she
takes
hold
of
the
can
and
pushes
him
into
a
sheet
of
drywall
the
board
breaks
and
falls
on
top
of
him
as
he
falls
over
one
of
the
others
dives
for
buffy
but
she
rolls
out
of
the
way
and
onto
her
feet
immediately
she
crouches
down
and
stakes
him
in
the
chest
he
bursts
into
ashes
the
other
one
grabs
her
from
behind
and
pulls
her
away
faith's
opponent
is
back
up
and
she
spins
around
once
and
does
a
side
kick
getting
him
in
the
stomach
the
kick
forces
him
back
and
he
knocks
his
head
hard
into
a
low
pipe
behind
him
buffy's
attacker
throws
her
onto
a
stack
of
plywood
she
hits
the
wall
behind
it
but
quickly
gets
to
her
feet
the
vampire
jumps
onto
the
stack
just
in
time
to
be
side
kicked
in
the
stomach
he
flies
back
and
lands
on
a
dumpster
hard
on
his
back
rolls
off
and
falls
to
the
ground
faith's
assailant
punches
her
in
the
face
but
she
isn't
fazed
in
the
least
she
blocks
two
punches
with
her
forearms
and
then
backhand
punches
him
in
the
face
my
dead
mother
hits
harder
than
that
she
grabs
him
by
the
sweater
and
throws
him
onto
a
couple
of
sheets
of
drywall
laid
across
two
sawhorses
they
break
instantly
under
his
weight
she
runs
up
to
him
grabs
his
sweater
and
punches
him
in
the
face
buffy
flips
her
opponent
in
an
awkward
open
front
layout
and
he
lands
hard
on
a
large
duct
pipe
which
crushes
under
him
she
looks
over
at
faith
who
is
whaling
away
on
her
vampire
with
continuous
punches
to
the
face
faith
stake
him
already
and
give
me
a
hand
still
another
vampire
grabs
her
by
her
jacket
and
throws
her
to
the
ground
she
lands
on
her
stomach
near
a
piece
of
wood
lying
there
the
vampire
and
her
original
attacker
both
make
a
grab
for
her
meanwhile
faith
keeps
whaling
on
her
victim

buffy
reaches
desperately
for

of
her
for
kakistos
we
live
for
kakistos
you'll
die
buffy
glances
up
at
him
for
an
instant
then
continues
desperately
clawing
for
the
hunk
of
wood
buffy
screams
faith
faith
pays
her
no
attention
and
just
keeps
punching
her
vampire
to
a
pulp
oh
part

the
alley
buffy
keeps
reaching
for
the
twobyfour
faith
continues
her
pounding
buffy
finally
manages
to
grab
the
board
and
she
swings
it
up
and
beans
one
of
the
vampires
in
the
face
with
it
and
turning
to
the
other
push
kicks
him
off
of
her
she
quickly
gets
to
her
feet
and
looks
over
at
faith
faith
the
one
she
kicked
off
makes
a
grab
at
her
from
behind
and
she
instinctively
turns
and
jams
the
makeshift
stake
home
the
vampire
crumbles
to
ashes
she
drops
the
hunk
of
wood
reaches
into
her
jacket
for
a
proper
stake
and
heads
over
to
faith
faith
is
still
whaling
on
the
vampire
long
after
he's
too
dazed
to
fight
back
you
faith
punch
can't
faith
punch
touch
faith
punch
me
she
shakes
the
vampire
a
bit
before
going
back
to
punching
him
buffy
comes
up
behind
her
grabs
her
by
the
waist
and
pulls
her
off
of
him
she
them
thrusts
down
with
her
stake
and
dusts
him
without
skipping
a
beat
she
confronts
faith
with
her
behavior
what
is
wrong
with
you
what
are
you
talking
about
i'm
talking
about
you
'living
large'
on
that
vampire
gee
if
doing
violence
to
vampires
upsets
you
i
think
you're
in
the
wrong
line
of
work
yeah
or
maybe
you
like
it
a
little
too
much
i
was
getting
the
job
done
the
job
is
to
slay
demons
not
beat
them
to
a
bloody
pulp
while
their
friends
corner
me
faith
shrugs
i
thought
you
could
handle
yourself
faith
walks
off
buffy
lets
out
an
exasperated
sigh
cut
to
the
school
halls
the
next
day
buffy
and
giles
come
out
of
the
cafeteria
and
walk
toward
the
library
what
you
must
realize
buffy
is
that
you
and
faith
have
very
different
temperaments
giles
sips
his
coffee
yeah
and
mine's
the
sane
one
buffy
giles
chuckles
the
girl's
not
playing
with
a
full
deck
giles
she
has
almost
no
deck
she
has
a
three
you
said
yourself
that
sheshe
killed
one
shsheshe's
just
a
plucky
fighter
who
got
a
little
carried
away
which
is
natural
she's
focused
on
the
slaying
she
doesn't
have
a
whole
other
life
here
as
you
do
she
doesn't
need
a
life
she
has
mine
i
think
you're
being
a
little
no
i'm
being
a
lot
buffy
giles
sips
again
i
know
that
but
she
nearly
got
us
both
killed
the
girl
needs
help
all
right
i'll
see
if
i
can
reach
her
watcher
at
the
retreat
they're
giles
checks
his
watch
eight
hours
ahead
now
i
guess
they're
probably
sitting
down
to
a
nightcap
buffy
continues
on
toward
the
library
but
giles
just
stands
there
and
starts
to
stare
off
into
space
i
wonder
if
they
still
kayak
i
used
to
love
a
good
kayak
giles
buffy
comes
back
you
see
tthey
don't
even
consider
giles
sees
her
looking
at
him
sorry
i
digress
giles
they
both
continue
the
um
vampires
that
attacked
you
can
you
furnish
me
with
some
details
that
might
help
me
trace
their
lineage
i
mean
ancient
ororor
modern
dress
amulets
cultish
tattoos
giles
sips
his
coffee
uh
no
tats
crappy
dressers
and
uh
oh
the
one
that
nearly
bit
me
mentioned
something
about
kissing
toast
buffy
a
spark
of
recognition
appears
on
giles'
face
he
lived
for
kissing
toast
you
mean
'kakistos'
buffy
tries
to
remember
maybe
it
was
taquitos
maybe
he
lived
for
taquitos
buffy
looks
at
him
what
kakistos
giles
heads
into
the
library
buffy
frowns
is
that
bad
buffy
follows
him
cut
into
the
library
giles
quickly
paces
in
and
sets
his
things
on
the
counter
'kakistos'
is
greek
it
means
the
worst
of
the
worst
giles
heads
behind
the
counter
it's
also
the
name
of
a
vampire
so
old
that
his
hands
and
feet
are
cloven
he
goes
into
his
office
and
comes
out
with
a
book
setting
it
on
the
counter
and
leafing
through
it
now
this
guy
shows
up
two
days
ago
right
right
around
the
same
time
my
bestest
new
little
sister
makes
the
scene
giles
looks
up
and
considers
you
think
he
and
faith
are
connected
giles
there
are
two
things
that
i
don't
believe
in
coincidence
and
leprechauns
well
buffy
it's
entirely
possible
that
they
both
arrived
here
by
chance
simultaneously
okay
but
i
was
right
about
the
leprechauns
right
giles
thinks
for
a
moment
as
far
as
i
know
yes
good
okay
you
get
england
on
the
phone
i'm
gonna
talk
to
faith
see
if
'khaki
trousers'
rings
kakistos
kakistos
rings
a
bell
or
an
alarm
right
right
buffy
heads
out
cut
to
the
hall
buffy
strides
toward
the
lounge
and
is
about
to
round
the
corner
toward
the
exit
when
scott
approaches
her
hi
buffy
surprised
to
see
him
scott
how
are
you
uh
ookay
you
know
ii
gotta
i
know
be
somewhere
else
right
think
of
this
as
my
lastditch
effort
i
realize
that
one
more
is
gonna
qualify
as
stalking
scott
nervously
i've
given
it
a
lot
of
thoughtsome
might
say
too
much
thoughtto
to
how
i
might
be
a
part
of
your
life
it
begins
with
conversation
we
all
know
this
maybe
over
a
cup
of
coffee
or
maybe
at
the
buster
keaton
festival
playing
on
state
street
all
this
weekend
buffy
finds
this
to
be
a
very
sweet
overture
and
smiles
warmly
she
takes
a
moment
to
consider
his
offer
you
know
come
to
think
of
it
ii
don't
think
i've
given
a
fair
chance
to
buster
keaton
i
i
like
what
i've
seen
of
him
so
far
i
i
think
it
might
be
time
to
see
a
little
more
scott
takes
and
releases
a
breath
smiling
keaton
is
key
oh
scott
reaches
into
a
pocket
um
i
got
you
a
little
present
scott
pulls
out
a
small
box
the
guy
in
the
retro
shop
said
that
it
represents
friendship
scott
holds
it
out
to
her
and
that's
something
i
would
very
much
like
to
have
with
you
buffy
takes
the
box
looks
up
at
him
and
back
at
the
box
she
takes
off
the
lid
and
looks
at
what's
inside
it's
a
claddagh
ring
you
like
she
immediately
has
an
anxiety
attack
and
drops
the
box
the
ring
falls
free
of
its
padding
and
hits
the
floor
with
an
echoing
clinking
giles
comes
down
the
hall
toward
them
just
in
time
to
see
it
fall
i
can't
iiii
can't
do
this
buffy
takes
a
quick
breath
scott
bends
down
to
pick
up
the
box
and
the
ring
he
looks
at
her
and
at
the
ring
okay
i
get
the
message
scott
leaves
buffy
just
stands
there
as
if
in
a
trance
giles
reaches
out
to
her
are
you
all
right
she
shoves
off
his
caring
hand
not
realizing
who
it
is
uh
buffy
looks
up
giles
i
uh
buffy
wipes
a
tear
yeah

tries
to

name
kakistos
faith
taken
aback
what
do
you

about
kakistos
that

her
apprehension
at

what'd

heads
for

like
you
took
care
of
your
watcher
this
stops
faith
cold
she
lets
go
of
the
doorknob
and
looks
down
sadly
a
moment
later
she
turns
to
buffy

faith
angrily
they
don't
have
a
word
for
what
he
did
to

a
knock
at

through

peephole
and
sees
that
it's
the
manager
looking
very
strung
out
faith
sighs
oh

behind
the
dead

and
others

stops
by
a
bucket
and
putting
her
foot
in
kicks
it
into
one
of
the
vampire's
faces
he
stumbles
backward
and
over
a
chair
she
does
a
full
spinning
hook
kick
to
the
other
vampire
and
a
side
kick
to
another
one
behind
her
he
falls
backwards
over
a
table
buffy
runs
and
jumps
onto
the
table

rolls
over
it
and
kicks
him
in
the
back
as
he
tries
to
get
back
up
kakistos
walks
into
the
building
his
oneeyed
gaze
fixed
on
faith
buffy
rolls
to
a
stand
on
the
table
she
picks
up
a
crowbar
and
swings
it
baseball
style
at
yet
another
vampire
advancing
towards
her
hitting
her
squarely
in
the
neck
and
knocking
her
down
and
out
she
sees
kakistos
advancing
on
faith
faith
buffy
gets
her
attention
don't
die
buffy
throws
her
the
crowbar
faith
catches
the
crowbar
in
midair
but
before
she
can
swing
it
at
kakistos
he
punches
her
hard
and
knocks
her
into
a
bunch
of
large
wooden
beams
leaning
against
the
wall
she
hits
the
floor
as
the
beams
go
tumbling
trick
walks
in
calmly
nodding
his
head
and
observing
the
fight
buffy
knife
hands
her
attacker
in
the
neck
and
throws
him
into
an
assisted
front
tuck
off
of
the
table
kakistos
calmly
steps
up
to
faith
as
she
scrambles
up
against
the
wall
cowering
he
reaches
down
and
grabs
her
by
the
shirt
picking
her
up
off
of
the
floor
no
once
he
has
her
up
he
punches
her
squarely
in
the
face
buffy
is
no
longer
on
the
table
and
she
roundhouse
kicks
over
it
knocking
the
legs
out
from
under
a
vampire
standing
on
it
he
rolls
off
of
the
table
and
onto
his
back
and
buffy
stakes
him
cleanly
she
looks
up
at
faith
being
whaled
on
by
kakistos
behind
her
the
unconscious
vampire
wakes
kakistos
finally
hits
faith
hard
enough
to
knock
her
from
his
own
grip
onto
the
floor
he
roars
loudly
buffy
jumps
up
and
runs
over
to
attack
him
she
roundhouse
kicks
him
in
the
back
of
the
knee
spins
around
and
tries
to
backhand
him
in
the
face
but
he
blocks
it
she
spins
around
the
other
way
and
backhands
him
in
the
face
the
now
wakened
vampire
gets
back
up
from
the
floor
and
trick
comes
up
behind
her
if
we
don't
do
something
the
master
could
get
killed
he
considers
that
for
a
moment
and
decides
that
wouldn't
be
such
a
bad
thing
well
our
prayers
are
with
him
he
and
the
vampire
turn
to
leave
buffy
tries
to
stake
kakistos
but
the
stake
can't
easily
penetrate
his
thick
hide
and
so
has
no
effect
on
him
he
grabs
buffy
by
the
hair
lifts
her
and
throws
her
back
trick
and
the
vampire
calmly
continue
on
their
way
out
there's
a
reason
these
vengeance
crusades
are
out
of
style
it's
the
modern
vampire
who
sees
the
big
picture
buffy
backhands
kakistos
landing
a
hard
punch
he
swings
at
her
but
she
ducks
she
stands
up
and
tries
to
stake
him
again
but
even
though
the
stake
goes
in
deeper
this
time
it
still
has
no
effect
on
him
again
he
grabs
her
by
the
head
and
shoves
her
back
into
the
wall
faith
recovers
from
her
daze
and
sees
him
looming
before
her
but
looking
at
buffy
instead
of
at
her
i
guess
you
need
a
bigger
stake
slayer
kakistos
laughs
maniacally
faith
sees
that
one
of
the
fallen
beams
has
a
broken
end
she
lifts
it
up
over
her
shoulder
and
before
kakistos
can
turn
his
attention
back
onto
her
she
thrusts
the
beam
through
his
chest
and
out
his
back
he
looks
down
at
it
and
back
up
at
faith
and
then
explodes
into
ashes
buffy
stares
in
amazement
faith
heaves
a
few
heavy
breaths
buffy
pulls
the
hair
back
from
her
face
and
steps
over
to
faith
who
looks
around
to
make
sure
nothing
else
is
about
to
attack
they
both
look
down
at
the
pile
of
ash
left
by
kakistos
you
hungry
starved
they
both
head
out
of
the
building
cut
to
sunnydale

next
day
cut
to
the
library

gets
up
from
his
desk
and
comes
out
to
the
table
in
the
main
room

council

approved
our
request
faith
is
to
stay
here
indefinitely
giles

around

after

until
a
new
watcher
is
assigned
giles
picks
up
some
papers
buffy
is
sitting
on
the
table
and
willow
is
sitting
in
a
chair

she
really
came
through
in
the
end
buffy
slides
off
of
the
table
she
had
a
lot
to
deal
with
but
she
did
it
she
got
it
behind
her
i'm
glad
to
hear
it
giles
looks
over
the
papers
buffy
looks
down
at
the
table
sadly
and
quietly
for
a
long
moment
angel
was
cured
giles
looks
up
i'm
sorry
when
i
killed
him
angel
was
cured
buffy
to
willow

spell

the
last
minute

buffy
willow
looks
up
taking
it
all
in
i
was
about
to
take
him
out
and
um
something
went
through
him
and
he
was
angel

anything
that
he'd
done

that
i
loved
him
and
i
kissed
him
and
i
killed
him
she
looks
down
at
the
table
again
for
another
long
moment
the
others
stay
silent
i
don't
know
if
that
helps
with
your
spell
or
not
giles
uh
yes
i
i
believe
it
will
willow
very
sympathetically
i'm
sorry
it's
okay
buffy
gives
them
a
little
smile
i've
been
holding
on
to
that
for
so
long
felt
good
to
get
it
out
buffy
pauses
then
smiles
thinly
i'll
see
you
guys
later
she
walks
out
of
the
library
while
looking
down
at
the
floor
willow
watches
her
friend
go
contemplating
the
meaning
of
it
all
giles
eventually
starts
to
go
back
to
his
office
as
he
walks
around
willow
she
gets
up
from
her
chair
giles
i
know
you
don't
like
me
playing
with
mystical
forces
but
i
can
really
help
with
this
binding
spell
there
is
no
spell
he
starts
toward
his
office
again
willow
begins
to
realize
that
he'd
made
the
whole
spell
issue
up
to
get
buffy
to
talk
and
release
her
inner
sorrow
cut
to
the
halls
scott
comes
out
of
a
classroom
buffy
is
waiting
behind
the
door
for
him
and
steps
out
into
the
hall
when
she
sees
him
pass
by
scott
scott
stops
uh
hello
scott
pulls
on
his
backpack
hey
uh
i
was
um
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
get
out
of
class
oh
um
why
um
there
was
someone
a
while
ago
and
uh
the
ring
sort
of
confused
me
but
i
liked
what
you
said
about
friendship
buffy
begins
to
ramble
i
liked
it
a
lot
and
buster
keaton
big
fun
and
i'm
capable
of
big
fun
even
though
there's
no
earthly
way
you
could
possibly
know
that
about
me
wow
if
i
knew
i
was
gonna
go
on
this
long
i
probably
would've
brought
some
water
uh
buffy
exhales
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
um
if
you
would
still
like
to
go
to
the
film
festivaland
i
would
understand
it
if
you
didn'ti'd
pretty
much
love
to
go
with
you
scott
looks
around
awkwardly
uh
ahem
scott
shrugs
i
don't
know
buffy
i'm
i'm
really
gonna
have
to
think
about
this
buffy
nods
in
understanding
he
starts
down
the
hall
for
a
few
steps
stops
and
immediately
comes
back
okay
you
know
what
i
thought
about
it
and
i'm
in
when
do
you
want
to
go
buffy
smiles
uh
well
i
have
one
thing
that
i
have
to
do
tonight
and
then
i'm
good
scott
smiles
good
buffy
smiles
back
at
him
warmly
cut
to
the
mansion
that
night
cut
inside
to
the
great
room
where
acathla
stood
buffy
slowly
walks
in
from
a
side
door
to
the
spot
where
she
slew
angel
she
looks
down
at
the
floor
and
the
tears
begin
to
come
she
slowly
crouches
down
and
looks
at
her
claddagh
ring
buffy
quietly
goodbye
gently
she
places
the
ring
on
the
floor
she
reflects
for
a
moment
before
standing
back
up
looking
at
the
great
hall
around
her
she
turns
around
and
slowly
starts
to
walk
away
toward
the
main
door
the
camera
shows
her
walking
from
a
high
angle
giving
a
good
view
of
the
cavernous
room
when
she's
gone
the
camera
cuts
to
the
ring
the
picture
fades
to
black
a
moment
later
a
bright
beam
of
light
illuminates
the
ring
on
the
floor
it
gets
more
and
more
intense
and
the
ring
begins
to
vibrate
clinking
madly
against
the
marble
suddenly
the
room
is
awash
with
a
blindingly
bright
white
light
emanating
from
a
dimensional
portal
opening
above
the
ring
a
body
falls
through
and
hits
the
stone
floor
hard
the
light
fades
as
the
portal
closes
and
a
naked
man
is
left
lying
there
he
is
unsteady
as
he
tries
to
get
up
but
he
is
too
weak
to
do
more
than
lift
his
face
it
is
angel
looking
very
dazed
his
breathing
is
shallow
and
labored
and
he
shivers
violently
as
he
looks
up
at
the
room
around
him
