the
bronze
the
camera
extends
out
from
the
catwalk
looking
straight
down
onto
the
people
below
they
are
dancing
to
the
slow
sensual
rhythm
of
never
an
easy
way
performed
by
morcheeba
think
i
slip
the
net
but
i
cut
myself
free
cut
to
the
crowd
below
buffy
and
xander
are
dancing
together
but
not
close
and
exchange
a
few
words
as
they
move
around
behind
them
cordelia
and
willow
are
sitting
at
a
table
and
chatting
i'm
not
losing
yet
so
don't
forget
me
i'll
say
it
replay
it
a
man
crosses
in
front
of
the
camera
temporarily
blocking
the
view
and
when
he's
gone
by
angelus
is
standing
beyond
the
table
near
the
base
of
the
stairs
he
watches
them
dance
his
voice
narrates
throughout
the
scene
passion
and
try
tomorrow
angelus
it
lies
in
all
of
us
i'll
say
it
replay
it
sleeping
and
live
with
sorrow
angelus
waiting
and
though
unwanted
you'd
think
i'd
learn
by
now
angelus
unbidden
it
will
stir
there's
never
an
easy
way
he
begins
to
move
around
the
room
all
the
while
keeping
his
stare
on
buffy
open
its
jaws
and
howl
i'll
get
through
somehow
i'm
on
my
knees
to
pray
cut
outside
to
the
alley
willow
and
buffy
come
walking
out
of
the
bronze
buffy
has
her
arm
hooked
into
willow's
cordelia
and
xander
are
behind
them
with
their
arms
around
each
other
you'd
think
i'd
learn
by
now
there's
never
an
easy
way
they
walk
past
a
couple
apparently
engaged
in
a
kiss
the
camera
stops
on
the
couple
i'll
get
through
somehow
the
man
lifts
his
head
from
the
woman
and
it's
angelus
just
finishing
a
bite
he
lets
the
woman's
dead
body
fall
to
the
pavement
he
steps
out
into
the
alley
leaving
the
woman's
body
lying
there
and
watches
the
group
as
they
walk
away
completely
unaware
of
his
presence
and
his
deed
he
morphs
into
his
human
guise
and
begins
to
follow
cut
to
a
shot
into
buffy's
room
from
outside
of
her
window
buffy
walks
around
her
bed
past
the
window
on
her
way
back
she
pauses
by
the
window
and
looks
out
she
lifts
the
blinds
a
little
and
scans
around
seemingly
satisfied
that
no
one's
there
she
walks
back
over
to
her
closet
unzipping
the
back
of
her
dress
along
the
way
cut
to
later
inside
her
room
she's
in
her
pajamas
now
she
sets
her
alarm
and
gets
into
bed
she
reaches
over
to
turn
off
her
light
and
settles
in
to
sleep
the
camera
closes
in
on
her
a
little
and
turns
to
include
the
window
in
the
shot
angelus
is
outside
looking
in
cut
to
even
later
in
her
room
the
camera
closes
in
on
a
sleeping
buffy
a
shadow
comes
across
her
bed
and
a
hand
reaches
over
to
stroke
her
hair
with
its
fingers
the
camera
pans
over
to
the
person
and
it's
angelus
sitting
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
and
looking
down
at
her
he
continues
his
narration
as
the
camera
pulls
out
for
a
shot
of
him
sitting
next
to
her
while
she
sleeps
it
speaks
to
us
guides
us
passion
rules
us
all
and
we
obey
what
other
choice
do
we
have
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

morning
in
buffy's
room
the
camera
pans
from
the
foot
of
her
bed
up
to
her
face
she
stirs
and
wakes
she
opens
her
eyes
to
look
over
at
her
clock
but
they
fix
on
an
envelope
left
next
to
her
on
her
pillow
she
lets
out
an
inquiring
moan
pushes
her
hair
back
and
picks
up
the
envelope
as
she
sits
up
she
looks
down
at
it
and
sees
that
it's
blank
she
opens
it
takes
out
the
paper
inside
unfolds
it
and
can
only
stare
at
it
in
disbelief
cut
to
a
view
of
the
sheet
on
it
is
a
pencil
sketch
of
her
sleeping
he
was
in
my
room
cut
to
the
library
giles
is
behind
the
counter
checking
in
various
books
buffy
walks
past
him
toward
the
table
as
he
looks
up
who
angel
he
was
in
my
room
last
night
he
comes
out
from
behind
the
counter
and
follows
her
over
to
the
table
xander
and
cordelia
are
there
also
are
you
sure
positive
when
i
woke
up
i
found
a
picture
he'd
left
me
on
my
pillow
buffy
crosses
her
arms
a
visit
from
the
pointedtooth
fairy
wait
i
thought
vampires
couldn't
come
in
unless
you
invited
them
in
yes
but
uh
once
you've
invited
them
in
thereafter
they're
they're
always
welcome
buffy
looks
down
then
over
at
xander
as
he
speaks
y'know
i
think
there
may
be
a
valuable
lesson
for
you
gals
here
about
inviting
strange
men
into
your
bedrooms
cordelia
realizes
oh
god
cordelia
looks
at
xander
i
invited
him
in
my
car
once
cordelia
looks
at
giles
that
means
he
can
come
into
my
car
whenever
he
wants
yep
you're
doomed
to
havin'
xander
cordelia
looks
at
him
to
give
him
and
his
vamp
pals
a
lift
whenever
they
feel
like
it
and
those
guys
never
chip
in
for
gas
cordelia
looks
away
disgusted
giles
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
spell
to
reverse
the
invitation
right
like
a
barrier
a
no
shoes
no
pulse
no
service
kind
of
thing
yeah
that
works
for
a
car
too
yes
well
iii
could
check
on
my
xander
hops
up
from
his
chair
hello

all
look
behind
them
and
see
jonathon
and
a
girl
come
into
the
library

of
knocking
jonathon

the
library

books

nods
xander

barnes
noble

walk
past
them
up
the
stairs
and
into
the
stacks
the
others
watch

go
until
they
disappear
xander
points
out
of
the
library
he
and
cordelia
pick
up
their
things
and
start
out
giles
looks
at
buffy
confused
but
follows
what
giles
gets
a
look
from
buffy
oh
jonathon
comes
back
out
of
the
stacks
hey

gone
hello
cut
to
the
hall
xander
and
cordelia
lead
giles
and
buffy
as
they
walk
along
so
angel
has
decided
to
step
up
his
harassment
of
you
by
sneaking
in
her
room
and
leaving
stuff
at
night
why
doesn't
he
just
slit
her
throat
or
strangle
her
while
she's
sleeping
or
cut
her
heart
out
cordelia
gets
looks
from
everyone
what
i'm
trying
to
help
they've
left
the
hall
and
walk
along
the
colonnade
yes
giles
to
buffy
uh
uh
look
it'sit's
classic
battle
strategy
to
throw
one's
opponent
off
his
game
hehehe's
just
trying
to
provoke
you
uh
to
taunt
you
to
to
goad
you
into
uh
some
mishap
of
some
sort
xander
looks
back
at
giles
the
xander
singsong
nahnahnahnahnahnah
approach
to
battle
yes
xander
once
more
you've
managed
to
boil
a
complex
thought
down
to
its
simplest
possible
form
giles
xander
smiles
giles
angel
once
told
me
that
when
he
was
obsessed
with
drusilla
the
first
thing
hhe
did
was
to
kill
her
family
xander
stops
and
looks
at
her
your
mom
i
know
i'm
gonna
have
to
tell
her
something
buffy
sits
on
a
wall
and
looks
at
giles
the
truth
giles
approaches
her
waving
his
finger
no
youyouyouyou
can't
do
that
yeah
the
more
people
who
know
the
secret
the
more
it
cheapens
it
for
the
rest
of
us
but
i've
gotta
tell
her
something
i've
gotta
do
something
giles
angel
has
an
allaccess
pass
to
my
house
and
i'm
not
always
there
when
my
mother
is
i
can't
protect
her
giles
flustered
i
told
you
i
will
find
aa
spell
what
about
until
you
find
a
spell
until
then
you
and
your
mother
are
welcome
to
ride
around
with
me
in
my
car
buffy
ii
understand
your
concern
but
it's
imperative
that
you
keep
a
level
head
through
all
this
that's
easy
for
you
to
say
you
don't
have
angel
lurking
in
your
bedroom
at
night
i
know
how
hard
this
is
for
you
giles
gets
a
look
from
buffy
all
right
i
don't
but
as
the
slayer
you
don't
have
the
luxury
of
being
a
slave
to
your
your
passions
you
mustn't
let
angel
get
to
you
no
matter
how
provocative
his
behavior
may
become
so
what
you're
basically
saying
is
'just
ignore
him
and
maybe
he'll
go
away'
giles
exhales
yes
precisely
hey
how
come
buffy
doesn't
get
a
snotty
'once

glances
over
at
jenny
with
her
eyes
and
then
starts
to
walk
out
of
the
classroom
willow
to
buffy
sorry

willow
they
exit
the

an
old
book

i
was
raised
by
the
people
that
angel

didn't
know
i
was
gonna

she
pauses
for
a
moment
before
looking
back
up
at
giles

willow
holds
the

and
reaches
down
for
a
blank
envelope
on
her
bed
willow
willow
turns
back
toward
her
aquarium
the
camera
follows
her
and
pans
around
the
tank
for
a
shot
of
her
through
the
fishless
water
she
opens
the
envelope
and
finds
a
string
she
pulls
on
it
and
out
come
her
fish
strung
together
one
after
the
other
willow
loses
her
grip
on

to
later
in
buffy's

as
he
looks
into
it
he
glances
up
at
jenny
for
an
instant
she
edges
away
from
him
you
know
what
i
hate
most
about
these
things
jenny
screams
as
he
heaves
it
into
the
chalkboard
behind
her
it
shatters
into
hundreds
of
pieces
and
a
lot
of
dust
angelus
smiles
they're
so
damn
fragile
angelus
loses
the
smile
must
be
that
shoddy
gypsy
craftsmanship

jenny
has
backed
into
the
wall
and
trembles
with
fear
she
starts
to
inch
her
way
toward
the
door
angelus
reaches
over
to
the
pc
and
turns
the
monitor
so
he
can
see
it
i
never
cease
to
be
amazed
how
much
the
world
has
changed
in
just
two
and
a
half
centuries
jenny
has
reached
the
door
and
tries
to
open
it
it's
locked
he
turns
the
monitor
back
around
it's
a
miracle
to
me
you
you
put
the
secrets
to
restoring
my
soul
in
here
he
shoves
the
computer
off
her
of
desk
and
onto
the
floor
it
breaks
and
the
monitor
shatters
and
sparks
and
starts
to
burn
angelus
tears
the
printout
from
the
printer
it
comes
out
here
angelus
looks
at
the
paper
'the
ritual
of
restoration'
wow

this
brings
back
memories
he
starts
to
tear
the
printout
in
half
wait
that's
your
oh

cure
angelus
finishes
tearing
no

fire

my
lucky
day
the
computer
angelus
holds
the
paper
over
the
flames
and
the
pages
angelus
warms
his
hands
looks
like
i
get
to
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
he
crouches
over
the
fire
to
warm
himself
more
jenny
starts
toward
the
back
door
angelus
looks
back
up
at
her
sporting
his
game
face
and
teacher
makes
three
she
starts
to
run
for
it
but
angelus
roars
and
quickly
jumps
and
grabs
hold
of
her
no
he
throws
her
back
into
the
locked
door
and
it
breaks
open
she
looks
back
at
him
scrambles
to
her
feet
and
begins
to
run
oh

to
the
halls
jenny
comes

the
door
to
the

area
and
runs
to
another
set
of
door
to
outside
but
they
are
locked
she
runs
back
into
the
lounge
sees
angelus
coming
and
runs
further
down
the
hall
angelus
pulls
open
the
doors
and
follows
her
at
a
fast
walk
cut
outside
to
another
hall
exit
jenny
bursts
through
the
door
and
runs
along
the
colonnade
angelus
is
not
far
behind
and
continues
after
her
at
a
quick
pace
soon
he
starts
to
run
as
well
jenny
keeps
running
checking
behind
her
every
so
often
she
reaches
the
next
building
and
struggles
with
the
door
she
looks
back
and
sees
angelus
running
toward
her
with
an
evil
grin
on
his
face
she
yanks
hard
at
the
door
several
more
times
before
it
opens
and
she
runs
in
cut
inside
the
hall
jenny
pulls
the
door
closed
behind
her
and
angelus
slams
into
it
she
starts
to
run
down
the
hall
angelus
has
to
yank
at
the
door
a
couple
of
times
before
it
opens
for
him
too
and
he
runs
in
after
her
a
cleaning
cart
is
in
the
hall
by
the
stairs
and
jenny
grabs
it
and
pushes
it
into
angelus
he
slams
into
it
and
flies
over
it
and
onto
the
floor
while
she
rushes
up
the
steps
cut
to
a
view
down
the
stairs
from
above
jenny
runs
up
and
out
of
view
angelus
isn't
on
the
floor
below
anymore
he's
nowhere
to
be
seen
cut
to
a
landing
by
a
large
arched
window
jenny
runs
up
onto
it
and
right
into
a
waiting
angelus
she
screams
when
he
grabs
hold
of
her
he
chuckles
and
looks
into
her
face
he
puts
one
hand
around
behind
her
head
and
touches
her
lips
with
the
fingers
of
his
other
the
view
out
of
the
window
is
of
the
park
beyond
with
the
palm
trees
lit
up
a
car
drives
by
sorry
jenny
this
is
where
you
get
off
he
takes
his
fingers
from
her
lips
and
puts
his
hand
under
her
chin
in
one
swift
movement
he
twists
her
head
and
snaps
her
neck
her
body
collapses
to
the
floor
he
looks
up
and
around
breathing
heavily
from
the
running
and
the
excitement
ah

never
get
tired
of
doing
that
part

got
it
you
would
have
been
proud
of
her
though
she
totally
kept
her
cool
willow
smiles
there
is
an
awkward
moment
of
silence
okay
well
i'll
tell
buffy
you
stopped
by
willow
smiles
giles
looks
up
the
stairs
would
you
um

intervene
on
on
buffy's
behalf
wwwith
her
mother
um
maybe
say
something
sure
like
what
would
you
say
giles
looks
up
the
stairs
again
w
uh
she
reaches
for
the
doorknob
and
opens
it
you
will
tell
buffy
i
dropped
by
giles
goes
out
you
bet
willow
closes
the
door
cut
to
buffy's
room
she's
sitting
on
her
bed
joyce
is
pacing
trying
to
take
in
what
she's
hearing
that
stuff
with
the
latins
and
the
herbs
uh
he's
just
real
superstitious
joyce
sits
with
her
eyes
closed
oh
we
just
thought
if
was
he
the
first
joyce
opens
her
eyes
no
wait
joyce
stands
up
i
don't
wanna
know
joyce
paces
i
don't
think
i
want
to
yeah
he
was
the
first
i
mean
the
only
joyce
stops
and
looks
at
her
daughter
he's
older
than
you
i
know
too
old
buffy
and
he's
obviously
not
very
stable
i
really
wish
joyce
sits
again
i
just
thought
you
would
show
more
judgment
buffy
looks
at
her
mother
he
wasn't
like
this
before
are
you
in
love
with
him
i
was
were
you
careful
buffy
looks
away
mom

is
no
time
joyce
gets
up
again
don't
'mom'
me
buffy
you
don't
get
to
get
out
of
this
you
had
sex
with
a
boy
you
didn't
even
see
fit
to
tell
me
you
were
dating
buffy
nods
i
made
a
mistake
yeah
well
don't
just
say
that
to
shut
me
up
because
i
think
you
really
did
i
know
that
buffy
looks
up
at
her
ii
can't
tell
you
everything
how
about
anything
buffy
you
can
shut
me
out
of
your
life
i
am
pretty
much
used
to
that
but
don't
expect
me
to
ever
stop
caring
about
you
because
it's
never
gonna
happen
i
love
you
more
than
anything
in
the
world
joyce
sits
next
to
buffy
on
the
bed
that
would
be
your
cue
to
uh
roll
your
eyes
and
tell
me
i'm
grossing
you
out
you're
not
joyce
inhales
oh

at
each
other
i
don't
know
it
was
my
first
cut
to
giles'
apartment
he
arrives
at
his
door
looking
at
his
keys
he
looks
up
and
sees
a
red
rose
on
the
door
and
can
hear
the
music
of
the
opera
la
boheme
by
puccini
coming
from
inside
he
takes
the
rose
inhales
its
aroma
and
smiles
he
opens
his
door
and
goes
in
cut
inside
giles
pokes
his
head
in
hello
he
sees
no
one
there
so
he
steps
in
and
closes
the
door
behind
him
jenny
he
puts
his
briefcase
aside
and
steps
over
to
his
coat
rack
it's
me
he
takes
off
his
coat
and
hangs
it
up
he
looks
around
again
and
sees
a
chilled
bottle
of
champagne
and
two
longstemmed
glasses
on
his
desk
on
top
of
the
crystal
ice
bucket
is
a
folded
piece
of
paper
leaning
against
the
bottle
he
sets
down
his
keys
and
the
rose
and
takes
the
note
he
unfolds
it
and
on
it
is
one
word
upstairs
he
smiles
and
looks
up
toward
the
loft
he
takes
off
his
glasses
and
sets
them
and
the
paper
down
he
runs
his
fingers
through

takes
the
two
glasses
and
starts
up
the
stairs
the
opera
music
gets
louder
as
he
nears
the
loft
the
camera
follows
his
footsteps
as
he
climbs
the
stairs
there
is
a
rose
on
each
step
when
he
reaches
the
top
he
is
smiling
he
sees
jenny
on
the
bed
but
she
isn't
moving
and
his
smile
quickly
fades
the
opera
reaches
a
crescendo
as
he
drops
the
bottle
and
glasses
and
they
shatter
on
the
floor
he
continues
to
look
at
jenny's
body
her
dead
eyes
stare
back
at
him
cut
to
later
giles
is
leaning
on
the
wall
by
his
front
door
staring
blankly
into
space
the
coroners
take
jenny's
body
away
a
police
officer
approaches
him
mr
giles

few
questions
giles
still
staring

giles
looks
at
the
officer

need
to
make
a

the
officer
looks
over
at
the
phone
and
back
at
him
giving
him
tacit
permission
giles
whispers
yes

goes
to
the
phone

to
buffy's
house
angelus
is
looking
into
the
dining
room
through
the
window
from
the
porch
buffy
and
willow
walk
through
it
and
into
the
living
room
angelus
narrates
passion
is
the
source
of
our
finest
moments
the
joy
of
love
the
clarity
of
hatred
and
the
ecstasy
of
grief
the
telephone
rings
and
buffy
runs
back
into
the
dining
room
to
get
it
she
picks
it
up
from
the
phone
stand
and
turns
so
angelus
can
see
her
face
hello
giles
hey
we
did
the
the
thing
it
worked
what
as
she
listens
to
giles
her
expression
becomes
increasingly
blank
she
lowers
the
phone
from
her
ear
willow
is
there
now
too
and
takes
the
phone
from
buffy
giles
buffy
leans
against
the
wall
and
slides
down
against
it
into
a
crouch
what
no
willow
puts
the
phone
down
no
willow
begins
to
cry
uncontrollably
noooo
angelus
gloats
as
he
looks
into
the
window
joyce
comes
into
the
dining
room
when
she
hears
the
crying
and
holds
willow
buffy
looks
off
into
space
then
finally
lowers
her
head
onto
her
knees
angelus
smiles
and
leaves
cut
to
later
cordelia
and
xander

up
to
buffy
and
willow
who
are
waiting
for
them
xander
opens
the
passenger
door
and
gets
out
where's

to
the
station
xander
closes
the
door
the
cops
said
he'd
already

xander
cordelia
closes
her
door
i
guess
they
just
wanted
to
ask
him
some
questions
cordelia
will
you
drive
us
to
giles'
house
of
course
but
don't
you
think
he
wants
to
be
left
alone
i'm
not
worrying
about
what
he
wants
i'm
worried
about
what
he's
gonna
do
they
all
get
into
the
car
cut
to
giles'
apartment
the
camera
sweeps
down
the
stairs
the
roses
have
all
been
trampled
and
broken
the
camera
turns
the
corner
of
the
staircase
and
sweeps
across
the
area
below
giles'
weapons
chest
is
open
and
almost
empty
he
walks
across
the
camera's
path
drawing
a
sword
the
camera
continues
around
the
room
over
to
his
old
victrola
where
the
opera
record
has
played
out
but
is
still
spinning
the
camera
pulls
back
past
the
desk
where
giles
has
a
large
bag
sitting
open
with
various
weapons
stashed
inside
he
adds
a
small
can
of
gasoline
grabs
the
bag
and
heads
out
of
the
apartment
the
camera
closes
in
on
the
desk
and
pans
down
to
a
pencil
sketch
of
jenny
lying
dead
on
the
bed
part

giles'
apartment
xander
pushes
the
door
open
a
piece
of
yellow
crime
scene
tape
is
stretched
across
the
doorway
hello
giles
he
ducks
under
the
tape
and
comes
in
willow
and
the
others
follow
xander
goes
over
to
the
desk
and
looks
around
i
guess
giles
had
a
big
night
planned
tonight
buffy
picks
up
the
sketch
of
jenny
giles
didn't
set
this
up
angel
did
buffy
hands
xander
the
sketch
this
is
the
wrapping
for
the
gift
buffy
heads
upstairs
oh
man
xander
exhales
poor
giles
willow
finds
the
nearly
empty
weapons
chest
look
all
his
weapons
are
gone
but
i
thought
he
kept
his
weapons
at
the
library
no
those
are
his
uh
everyday
weapons
these
were
his
good
weapons
the
ones
he
uh
breaks
out
when
company
comes
to
visit
buffy
comes
back
downstairs
and
stops
on
the
corner
landing
so
he's
not
here
well
then
where
is
he
he'll
go
to
wherever
angel
is
xander
turns
to
face
the
girls
that
means
the
factory
right
so
giles
is
gonna
try
to
kill
angel
then
well
it's
about
time
somebody
did
xander
i'm
sorry
but
let's
not
forget
that
i
hated
angel
long
before
you
guys
jumped
on
the
bandwagon
so
i
think
i
deserve
a
little
something
for
not
saying
'i
told
you
so'
long
before
now
and
if
giles
wants
to
go
after
the
uh
xander
looks
up
at
buffy
fiend
that
murdered
his
girlfriend
i
say
'faster
pussycat
kill
kill'
xander
looks
back
at
willow
and
cordelia
you're
right
willow
and
cordelia
look
up
at
buffy

you
buffy

the
bad
teacher

with
a
full
sack
spike
gets
a
look
from
angelus
i
love
a
good
slaughter
as
much
as

only
leave
us
with
one
incredibly
brassedoff
slayer
don't
worry
roller
boy
i've
got
everything
under
control
a
molotov
cocktail
swooshes
in
and
bursts
on
the
table
setting
it
ablaze
drusilla
runs
away
with
spike
wheeling
right
behind
her
they
stop
out
of
reach
of
the
flames
angelus
cuts
across
at
the
end
of
the
table
and
gets
hit
in
the
shoulder
with
a
crossbow
bolt
he
grabs
it
to
pull
it
out
while
looking
to
see
who
his
attacker
is
giles
walks
toward
him
with
a
baseball
bat
angelus
pulls
the
bolt
out
and
throws
it
aside
giles
puts
the
end
of
the
bat
into
the
flames
and
it
catches
fire
he
swings
it
and
hits
angelus
in
the
face
then
again
on
the
return
swing
angelus
staggers
and
bends
down
jeez
whatever
happened
to
wooden
stakes
giles
whales
on
angelus'
back
several
times
drusilla
makes
a
move
to
intervene
but
is
held
back
by
spike
uhuh
no
fair
going
into
the
ring
unless
he
tags
you
first
angelus
stands
back
up
but

on
him
making
angelus
collapse
all
the
way
to
the
floor
angelus
tries
to
get
up
but
giles
swings
into
his
jaw
from
underneath
he
wields
the
still
burning
bat
over
his
head
but
as
he
brings
it
down
angelus
catches
it
and
they
begin
to
struggle
angelus
quickly
gains
the
upper
hand
and
takes
giles
by
the
throat
lifting
him
off
of
his
feet
he
drops
the
bat
all
right
you've
had
your
fun
but
you
know
what
it's
time
for
now
he
gets
kicked
in
the
back
by
buffy
and
lets
giles
fall
to
the
floor
she
pulls
him
back
and
slams
him
into
the
spiral
staircase
my
fun
she
kicks
him
in
the
face
and
then
shoves
him
onto
the
floor
drusilla
quickly
wheels

away
buffy
kicks
angelus
in
the
face
again
as
he
tries
to
get
up
and
then
lunges
at
him
he
grabs
her
flips
her
over
and
tries
to
get
away
up
the
stairs
buffy
gets
back
to
her
feet
fast
with
giles'
dropped
baseball
bat
in
hand
and
pushes
it
between
the
stair
railings
to
trip
angelus
up
he
falls
and
she
grabs
one
of
his
legs
he
kicks
out
at
her
with
it
and
knocks
her
off
of
him
and
onto
the
floor
he
scrambles
up
the
stairs
buffy
gets
up
quickly
she
sees
a
stack
of
crates
runs
up
it
to
the
catwalk
above
and
meets
angelus
there
he
swings
at
her
but
she
ducks
and
kicks
him
in
the
back
of
the
knee
making
him
collapse
onto
the
railing
she
grabs
a
loop
of
rope
throws
it
around
his
neck
and
yanks
him
back
and
forth
between
the
railings
several
times
then
kicks
him
in
the
chest
making
him
stagger
back
and
fall
onto
his
butt
he
gets
up
fast
but
she
grabs
onto
a
pipe
above
her
head
and
swings
with
both
feet
into
his
chest
again
making
him
fly
back
into
a
barrel
and
some
ducting
she
waits
on
the
catwalk
for
him
to
come
at
her
again
ready
to
fight
he
charges
and
she
takes
him
and
diverts
him
past
her
and
onto
the
catwalk
grating
where
he
lands
with
his
head
against
one
of
the
vertical
railing
bars
she
kicks
his
face
and
follows
up
with
several
punches
and
another
kick
he
starts
to
laugh
as
she
grabs
him
by
the
coat
and
bangs
his
head
into
the
railing
a
couple
of
times
are
you
gonna
let
your
old
man
just
burn
she
looks
down
and
sees
the
flames
getting
higher
and
nearer
to
giles
angelus
takes
advantage
of
the
distraction
and
grabs
her
legs

her
and
throws
her
over
the
railing
she
manages
to
control
her
fall
and
land
on
her
feet
near

angelus
takes
off
down
the
catwalk
and
out
of
the
building

wakes

and
gets
him
to

she
supports
him
as
they
make
their
way
from
the
building
also
cut
outside
they
both
come
out
coughing
from
the
smoke
he
pushes
her
away
from
him
why
did

wasn't
your
fight
she
punches
him
in
the
jaw
and
he
spins
and
falls
to
the
pavement

trying
to
get
yourself
killed
she
begins
to
cry
and
crouches
down
to
hug
him

cries
and
hugs
her
back

narrates
it
hurts
sometimes
more
than
we
can
bear
giles
tears
the
tape
from
his
doorway
and
just
stares
at
it
for
several
seconds
angelus
narrates
if
we
could

without
passion
maybe
we'd
know
some
kind
of
peace
but
we
would
be
hollow
giles
enters

across
a
small
pond
angelus
narrates
without
passion
we'd
be
truly
dead
the
camera
pans
past
jenny's
gravestone
giles
kneels
down
and
lays
some
flowers
on

looks
at
her
name
on
the
headstone
for
a
moment
before
standing
back
up

as

small
filing
cabinet
next
to
it

around
a
few
times
before

leaning
against
the
side
of
the
cabinet
