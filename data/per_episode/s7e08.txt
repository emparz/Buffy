a

comes
into

reading
a

when
he
looks
up
he
notices
that
the
place
has
been
broken
into
there's
a
broken
flower
vase
plus
furniture
is
disarranged
nora
nora
he
walks
into
the
next
room
and
sees
a
teenage
girl
lying
on
the
floor
apparently
stabbed
in
the
back
she's
not
moving
the
man
looks
stunned
momentarily
then
someone
cloaked
in
a
fulllength
hooded
black
robe
tries
to
stab
him
with
a
silver
curved
dagger
the
man's
reflexes
are
quick
though
and
he
blocks
with
his
briefcase
he
runs
to
grab
a
sword
from
his
collection
but
is
attacked
from

by
another
robed
person
he
falls

willow
comes
home
hurriedly
through
the
front
door
buffy
willow
starts
to
go
upstairs
from
the
living
room
dawn
answers
she's
sitting
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
couch
hugging
a
pillow
amid
the
destruction
from
her
earlier
encounter
she's
not
here
dawn
oh
my
god
willow
goes
to
her
side
what're
you—
dawn
what
happened
here
what—
you're
cut
i'm
all
right
let
me
see
make
sure
willow
turns
her
face
to
inspect
it
i
saw
mom
what
she
was
here
willow
i
saw
her
she
was
here
and
she
spoke
to
me
oh
sweetie
no
she
was
right
here
and—and
then
she
wasn't
she—
it
wasn't
her
what
at
least
i
don't
think
ii
saw
something
too
and
it
looked
like
someone
else
but
it
wasn't
i
don't
understand
it's
the
big
bad
dawn
the
one
we
knew
was
coming
but
that's
what
she
said
mom
she
said
that
things
were
coming
that
things
were
on
their
way
and
that
she
loves
us
so
it
had
to
be
her
right
i
mean
her
warning
was
true
willow
shakes
head
i
don't
know
i
just
don't
think
we
can
trust
anything
right
now
so
maybe
the
evil
thing
messing
with
you
was
here
too
only
maybe
it
was
the
thing
trying
to
keep
mom
away
'cause
she
was
trying
to
protect
me

actually
know
that
he's
killed
anyone
you
know
lately
might
all
just
be
a
mistake
yeah
but
you
don't
think
so
ok
have
you
searched
his
room
for
clues
trophies
from
victims
killers
like
to
keep
trophies
sometimes
scalps
necklaces
made
from
human
teeth
you
know
it
didn't
occur
to
me
to
look
but
thanks
for
the
tip
ok
so
you'll
be
safe
in
here
plenty
of
sunlight
for
you
to
hide
in
xander
tries
to
leave
anya
follows
him

that's
it
you're
not
at
least
gonna
like
leave
me
a
crossbow
or
a
flame
thrower
something
to
protect
myself
we
don't
want
him
to
know
we
suspect
anything
besides
if
he
tries
to
leave
i
don't
want
you
confronting
him
call
buffy
and
just
let
her
know
that
he's
on
the
move
you're
gonna
be
fine
xander
grabs
his
hard
hat
and
briefcase

because
if
i
get
vamped

xander

day
willow's
quietly
closing
the
door
to

buffy
runs
up
the
stairs
yelling
dawn
dawn
willow
softly
buffy
it's
ok
she's
ok
not
hurt
she's
just
exhausted
finally
fell
off
to
sleep
what
the
hell
happened
downstairs
looks
like—
hell
happened
yeah
this
big
evil
that's
been
promising
to
devour
us—well
i
think
it's
started
chomping
oh
god
and
it
started
with
dawn
both
of
us
buffy
this
thing
knows
us
it
made
us
think
that
we
were
talking
to
people
we
knew
mine
said
it
came
with
a
message
from
tara
but
dawn
actually
saw
your
mother
this
thing—it
had
me
for
a
while—i
mean
before
it
started
letting
loose
with
the
pulsepounding
terror
but
before
that
the
lies
were
very
convincing
it
just
seems
real
lies
i
mean
maybe—maybe
to
confuse
us
to
mess
us
up
or
maybe
just
to
be
cool
vampire
i
killed
last
night
told
me
spike
sired
him—two
nights
ago
well
that's
impossible
right
so
maybe
it
was
another
one
a
fakeout
you
got
one
too
it
wasn't
a
real
vamp
it
dusted
real
enough
buffy
do
you
think
spike
is—
i
can't
buffy
sighs
i
hope
not
but
if
i'm
wrong
and
he
is
then
i
have
to
see
it
for
myself
i
have
to
be
there
to
stop
it
fade
to
black
act

spike's
sleeping
shirtless
in
the

she
sneaks
over
to
his
dresser
and
goes
through

drawer
looking
for
something
the
shot
shows
that
spike's
wearing
nothing
under
the
sheets
anya
goes
through
his
pants
which
are
on
the
bed
then
through
his
shirt
which
is
on
the
floor
he
rolls
over
and
she
continues
rifling
through
his
stuff
he
wakes
and
grabs
her
wrist
she's
frozen
in
panic
anya
do
be
specific
and
tell
a

closer
to
him
while

leans
over
his
chest
and
kisses
his
neck
spike
has
backed
away
as
far
as
he
can
but
there's
a
wall
preventing
further
retreat
so
he
just
lies
there
still
and
unresponsive
anya
notices
the
utter
lack
of
reciprocation
and
sits
up
spike
sighs
anya
hmm

i'm
not
tempted
obviously

haunts
me
all
of
it
if
you
think
that
i
would
add
to
the
body
count
now
you
are
crazy
so
what—you
just
troll
the
promenade
looking
for
drunk
coeds
cause
you're
hungry
for
conversation
spike
laughs
oh
is
that
what
this
is
right
what
you're
jealous
don't
play
games
not
now
spike
puts
on
shirt
yeah
you
saw
me
chatting
up
another
bird
giving
the
eye
to
somebody
else
touched
a
nerve
didn't
it
don't
flatter
yourself
it
burns
huh
but
you
can't
admit
it
so
you
trump
up
some
charge
about
me
being
back
on
the
juice
this
vampire
i
killed
told
me—
told
you
what
that
i
go
out
yeah
i
talk
to
people
women
talk
to
them
'cause
i
can't
talk
to
you
oh
spike
save
it
as
daft
a
notion
as
soulful
spike
the
killer
is
it
is
nothing
compared
to
the
idea
that
another
girl
could
mean
anything
to
me
this
chip—they
did
to
me
i
couldn't
help
it
but
the
soul
i
got
on
my
own—for
you
i
know
so
yeah
i
go
and
pass
the
time
with
someone
but
that's
all
it
is
is
time
'cause—god
help
me
buffy—it's
still
all
about
you
spike
this
vampire
told
me
you
sired
him
that
doesn't
mean—
he
said
you
killed
him
dumped
him
in
a
parking
lot
somewhere
and
you
believe
him
vampires
aren't—
i
did
follow
you
last
night
and
you
know
what
you
didn't
look
lonely
or
casual
to
me
you
looked
like
you
were
on
the
prowl
you
can't
know
that
so
then
tell
me
tell
me
what
happened
you
talked
to
her
then
what
we
talked
that's
all
i
remember
all
you
remember
i
don't
know
i
go
out
i
talk
to
people
or
i
don't
it's
boring
it
all
bleeds
together
well
if
you
seem
to
forget
that
much
then—
not
that
the
taste
of
human
blood
that
i'd
remember
you
were
camped
out
on
the
hell
mouth
talking
to
invisible
people
recently
how
can
you
be
sure
of—
no
you
are
wrong
you've
got
an
accusation
from
a
pile
of
dust
and
not
a
shred
of
proof
so
i'll
get
some
buffy

and
anya's
looking

buffy
and
dawn
are
standing
nearby
ok
guys
find
me
some
evidence
that
he
did
this
really
are
you
sure
that's
what
you
want
find
me
the
proof
that
he
didn't
buffy
anya
sits
at
table
near
willow
you
only
think
spike
is
turning
people
'cause
that
vampire
told
you
so
right
but
that
night
we
were
all
told
things
that
weren't
true
maybe
what
what
maybe
well
just
because
those
weren't
the
spirits
of
you
know
our
people—just
because
it
was
some
evil
thing
doesn't
mean
what
they
said
can't
be
true
i
used
to
tell
the
truth
all
the
time
when
i
was
evil
look
we
can't
assume
anything
we
need
hard
facts
well
if
spike
is
biting
people
again
should
there
be
more
dead
people
with
neck
trauma
right
we
can
find
that
no
no
we
can't
find
that
but
that's
easy
that
computer's
a
moron
i
mean
no
there's
not
really
an
increase
in
neck
injuries
but
but
what
oh
missing
people
eight
maybe
oh
ten
of
them
no
bodies
they're
just
missing
mostly
young
lots
of
girls
so
it's
true
what
that
vampire
told
buffy
turned
out
to
be
true
maybe
but
it
still
doesn't
prove
that
it's
spike
right
now
he's
the
only
one
who
knows
for
sure

hesitates
at

you
won't

understand
it's
a
risky
proposition
first
spike
blocking
spike's

there's
an
order
the

him
across

grabs
a

you

he
really
didn't

you're
right
that
is
a

wait
is
he—is
he
staying
here
i
don't
know
but
i'm
not
letting
him
out
of
my

that's
for
sure
buffy
he's
been
feeding
on
human
blood
that's
gotta
do
stuff
i'm
not
keeping
him
around
just
to

him
i
think
there
was
something
there
talking
to
him
making
him
do
things
something
like
what
was
talking
to
us
maybe
but
if
it
was
it's
been
screwing
with
spike
big

so
you
want
him
around
because
look
there's
something
evil
working
us
and
if
we
are
ever
gonna
have
a
chance
to
fight
it
we
need
to
learn
