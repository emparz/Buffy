prologue

a
large
park
the
camera
pans
along
some
flowery
foliage
until
it
reaches
a
pair
of
green
scaly
legs
firmly
planted
to
the
ground
and
a
pair
of
human
legs
dangling
and
kicking
from
someone
pinned
high
against
a
tree
the
monster
makes
gurgling
noises
and
lowpitched
roars
cut
to
buffy
being
held
against
the
tree
by
her
neck
the
monster's
face
has
tentacles
coming
off
of
the
back
of
his
head
as
well
as
the
front
in
place
of
lips
his
teeth
are
placed
vertically
between
the
two
center
tentacles
his
scaly
green
skin
glistens
with
slime
buffy
yells
out
desperately
nnnrrf
nnnrrf
near
a
picnic
table
xander
is
just
coming
to
apparently
having
been
knocked
around
by
the
monster
as
well
at
the
table
willow
frantically
searches
through
their
bag
of
demonkilling
implements
oh
god
demon
demon
what
kills
a
demon
buffy
struggles
with
the
monster's
hand
at
her
neck
but
can't
get
it
to
budge
and
has
a
hard
time
breathing
nnnrrf
nnnrrf
willow
still
searching
oh
nerf
not
nerf
knife
she
finds
a
knife
and
runs
with
it
to
buffy's
aid
she
tosses
the
knife
to
buffy
who
blindly
grabs
it
from
behind
out
of
midair
and
stabs
the
monster
in
the
chest
the
monster
immediately
falls
over
dead
taking
buffy
down
with
it
willow
and
xander
help
her
up
okay
that
was
too
close
for
comfort
not
that
slaying
is
ever
comfy
but
you
know
what
i
mean
buffy
takes
a
deep
breath
if
you
guys
hadn't
been
here
to
help
but
we
were
and
we
did
and
and
we're
all
fine
willow
looks
down
at
the
monster
isn't
he
gonna
go
poof
mm
i
guess
these
guys
don't
we'll
have
to
bury
him
or
something
uhhf
they
walk
over
to
the
picnic
table
makes
you
appreciate
vamps
though
no
fuss
no
muss
buffy
sits
crosslegged
on
one
end
of
the
table
xander
sits
on
the
other
and
willow
sits
on
the
bench
below
and
between
them
and
grabs
a
drink
so
how
come
faith
was
a
noshow
i
thought
mucusy
demons
were
her
favorites
xander
munches
on
a
snack
couldn't
reach
her
again
she
hasn't
been
hanging
out
much
buffy
reaches
for
a
snack
i
detect
worry
a
little
bit
slaying's
a
rough
gig
too
much
alone
time
isn't
healthy
stuff
gets
pentup
buffy
munches
the
snack
we
should
try
to
do
more
socializing
with
her
well
burial
detail
aside
does
this
cap
us
off
for
the
day
you
got
plans
i
cannot
stress
enough
how
much
i
don't
have
plans
no
luck
reaching
cordelia
i've
left
a
few
messages
sixty
seventy
but
you
know
what
really
bugs
me
xander
to
willow
okay
we
kissed
it
was
a
mistake
but
i
know
that
was
positively
the
last
time
we
were
ever
gonna
kiss
darn
tootin'
and
they
burst
in
rescuing
us
without
even
knocking
i
mean
this
is
really
all
their
fault
your
logic
does
not
resemble
our
earth
logic
mine
is
much
more
advanced
at
least
tomorrow's
monday
another
school
day
well
that's
good
you
know
focus
on
school
that's
the
strong
willow
way
to
heal
actually
i
was
more
thinking
oz
will
be
there
and
i
can
beg
for
forgiveness
that
works
too
ii
wanna
be
strong
willow
but
then
i
think
i
may
never
get
to
be
close
to
oz
again
and
it's
like
all
the
air
just
goes
out
of
the
room
i
know
the
feeling
right
i
mean
you
went
through
it
with
angel
and
you're
still
standing
so
tell
us
wise
one
how
do
you
deal
i
have
you
guys
cut
to
cordelia's
bedroom
she's
sitting
on
her
bed
with
the
lights
very
low
she
has
a
picture
of
herself
xander
willow
and
buffy
all
with
their
arms
around
each
other
and
is
cutting
each
person
off
with
a
straight
vertical
cut
she
lets
the
pieces
fall
into
a
bowl
on
a
breakfast
tray
in
the
background
her
answering
machine
plays
back
her
messages
hey
it's
xander
if
you
get
this
call
me
the
last
part
of
the
picture
left
in
her
hand
is
of
xander
and
she
cuts
diagonally
right
through
his
face
hi
xander
i
uh
well
i'm
in
if
you
feel
like
calling
bye
cordelia's
eyes
and
cheeks
are
heavy
with
tears
she
sighs
takes
a
match
and
strikes
it
she
lights
xander's
part
of
the
picture
hi
cordelia
um
if
you
get
the
chance
if
we
could
talk
i'm
here
she
drops
the
lit
piece
into
the
bowl
and
holds
the
match
to
the
others
they
suddenly
all
burst
into
flame
the
light
of
the
flame
shows
just
how
tired
slagged
and
haggard
cordelia
has
become
hey
again
it's
me
i'm
here
again
she
watches
as
the
flames
consume
the
image
of
xander
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

the
halls
at
sunnydale
high
school
willow
waits
around
the
corner
from
oz's
locker
peeking
around
every
few
seconds
to
see
if

arrived
looking
very
worried
buffy
comes
up
behind
her

at
the
mall

at

pretty
scary
cut
to
the
student
parking
lot
cordelia
has
the
top
down
on
her
convertible
she
steps
out
looking
very
hot
in
a
brown
leather
skirt
and
jacket
with
matching
top
and
alligator
high
heel
d'orsay
pumps
with
matching
bag
from
prada
she
confidently
walks
into
school
cut
to
the
breezeway
leading
to
the
quad
she
walks
through
not
looking
quite
as
confident
anymore
since
the
other
students
are
just
passing
her
by
she
stops
when
she
sees
harmony
coming
her
way
with
some
of
her
friends
when
harmony
sees
cordelia
she
stops
too
for
an
instant
but
then
approaches
her

nontouching
hug
and
kisses
on

from
payless
god
cordy
when
i
heard
about

i
mean
i
couldn't
believe
it
but
it
was
smart
you
know
the
injury
thing
you
take
a
week
off
let
everybody
forget
about
the
temporary
insanity
that
was
xander
harris
cordelia
raises
her
eyebrows
xander
who
oh
they
all
exchange
a
little
fake
nervous
laughter
you
know
what
you
have
to
do
start
dating
get
back
on
the
horse
oh
absolutely
i
am
ready
to
ride
then
i
have
just
the
stallion
he's
so
you
she
leads
her
over
to
the
outside
stairs
where
jonathon
is
sitting
nursing
a
soft
drink
he
is
taken
aback
by
the
sudden
attention
and
looks
around
to
see
if
they
didn't
really
mean
someone
else
but
there
is
no
one
else
cordelia
realizes
she's
been
had
harmony
giggles
i'm
pretty
sure
he
won't
cheat
on
you
at
least
not
for
a
while
plus
he's
got
a
kill
moped
she
laughs
and
she
and
her
group
walk
off
jonathon
gives
her
a
sympathetic
look
knowing
what
it's
like
and
goes
back
to
nursing
his
soda
cut
to
the
halls
oz
finally
shows
up
at
his
locker
as
he
works
his
combination
willow
comes
around
the
corner
and
pretends
it's
a
chance
meeting
oz
wow
he
stops
opening
his
locker
and
slowly
turns
to
face
her
look
at
us
running
into
each
other
as
two
people
who
go
to
the
same
school
are
so
likely
to
do
now
and
then
hey
oz
starts
to
leave
willow
stops
him
oz
wait
please
he
stops
and
reluctantly
gives
her
his
attention
what
i
did
when
i
think
that
i
hurt
you
yeah
you
said
all
this
stuff
already
right
but
i
wanna
make
it
up
to
you
i
mean
if
you
let
me
i
wanna
try
just
you
can
leave
me
alone
i
need
to
figure
things
out
but
maybe
if
we
talk
about
it
we
could
look
i'm
sorry
this
is
hard
for
you
but
i
told
you
what
i
need
so
i
can't
help
feeling
like
the
reason
you
want
to
talk
is
so
you
can
feel
better
about
yourself
that's
not
my
problem
willow
is
left
feeling
completely
helpless
oz
goes
on
his
way
leaving
her
standing
there
cut
to
the
stairs
by
the
student
lounge
cordelia
walks
down
and
turns
down
the
hall
she
sees
xander
come
out
of
the
cafeteria
at
the
far
end
when
he
spots
her
he
stops
cordelia
looks
for
a
way
to
turn
this
to
her
advantage
and
pulls
an
old
boyfriend
out
of
the
crowd
hey
john
lee
do
i
have
something
caught
in
my
teeth
she
smiles
to
expose
her
teeth
and
angles
her
head
up
so
he
can
see
she
shifts
her
head
back
and
forth
and
john
lee
dutifully
follows
her
movements
from
a
distance
it
looks
to
xander
like
they
are
kissing
when
he's
seen
enough
he
goes
back
into
the
cafeteria
when
cordelia
sees
that
he's
gone
she
steps
back
from
john
lee
so
what's
new
god
it's
been
like
a
gazillion
years
john
lee
smiles
look
the
guys
are
kinda
down
on
me
lately
coach
has
cut
me
back
to
second
string
if
anyone
saw
me
hanging
with
xander
harris'
castoff
on
top
of
that
death
you
know
but
maybe
john
lee
makes
suggestive
eyes
if
you
wanna
go
someplace
private
cordelia
surprised
to
find
the
tables
turned
what
think
about
it
john
lee
leaves
cordelia
can't
believe
what
a
social
leper
she's
suddenly
become
she
starts
back
down
the
hall
and
is
startled
when
anya
bumps
into
her
anya
smiles
hey

with
your
ohsobrilliant
insults

join
the
club

other
person
in
this
town
who

w
but
harmony

she
follows
me
around
if

girl

an
original
thought
her
head
would
explode
cordelia
notices

that
gucci

past

cut
to
the
bronze
that
night
tired
of
being
alone
by
the
spies
plays
in
the
background
cordelia
is
at
the
bar
dressed
sexily
in
red
pretending
to
have
great
conversation
with
a
guy
behind
her
sitting
on
the
couch
beneath
the
stairs
willow
and
buffy
look
glum
while
xander
pretends
to
be
having
fun
forcing
himself
to
laugh
he
looks
back
at
cordelia
who
seems
to
be
enjoying
her
conversation
xander
looks
back
at
willow
and
buffy
and
forces
out
gales
of
laughter
willow
and
buffy
exchange
a
look
then
buffy
gives
xander
a
creepy
look
excuse
me
i
need
to
be
both
giving
and
receiving
of
mirth
is
it
too
much
to
ask
for
a
little
backup
buffy
puts
her
hand
on
his
knee
i'm
here
for
you
xand
i'm
support
ogal
buffy
takes
her
hand

little
weird
about
this
usagainstcordelia
thing
she's
had
a
rough
time
at
the
bar
cordelia
is
still
enjoying
herself
it's
true
cordelia
belongs
to
the
justified
camp
she
should
make
us
pay
and
pay
and
pay
and
pay
in
fact
there's
just
not
enough
pay
for
what
we
xander
interrupts
look
you
want
to
do
guiltapalooza
fine
but
i'm
done
with
that
starting
this
minute
i'm
gonna
grab
ahold
of
that
crazy
little
thing
called
life
and
let
it
do
its
magical
little
healy
thing
what's
done
is
done
let's
be
in
the
moment
behold
the
beauty
that
is
now
xander
bounces
his
eyebrows
who's
with
me
he's
actually
making
sense
we're
young
and
free
in
america
how
dare
we
be
spun
by
love
or
the
lack
of
same
absolutely
iit's
selfindulgent
ii'm
in
i'm
on
the
joy
train
willow
smiles
they
all
put
on
bright
smiles
and
radiate
them
into
the
bronze
slowly
their
luster
fades
and
they
all
end
up
looking
glum
again
that
didn't
work
who
wants
chocolate
willow
and
xander
both
raise
their
hands
i'm
up
she
gets
up
and
heads
for
the
cappuccino
bar
look
at
her
xander
indicates
cordelia
tears
of
a
clown
baby
or
is
it
grins
of
a
sad
person
xander
reaches
over
to
willow
in
his
old
familiar
way
or
maybe
it's
xander
your
hand
xander
jerks
back
his
hand
oops
sorry
but
why
'oops'
i
mean
we
always
touch
digits
it's
a
friend
thing
comfort
like
chocolate
willow
shrugs
maybe
it
used
to
be
but
since
we
it's
different
willow
xander
looks
away
ii'm
sorry
but
if
i
wanna
make
things
right
with
oz
my
hands
willow
xander
looks
back
my
all
my
stuff
has
to
be
for
him
only
xander
understands
but
he
sure
isn't
happy
about
it
cut
to
the
cappuccino
bar
while
waiting
in
line
buffy
notices
cordelia
talk
briefly
with
anya
and
say
goodbye
as
she
goes
a
boy
bumps
into
her
jostling
her
wound
she
puts
her
hand
over
it
as
she
walks
out
buffy
decides
to
follow
cut
outside
buffy
catches
up
with
her
hey
cordelia
wait
a
second
cordelia
stops
and
faces
her
did
xander
send
you
to
beg
for
him
because
if
he
did
no
i'm
a
free
agent
i
promise
i
just
wanted
to
see
how
you
are
never
been
better
cordelia
starts
to
go
buffy
follows
cordelia
i
know
what
it's
like
to
be
hurt
by
someone
buffy
cordelia
faces
her
hurt
so
much
that
you
don't
think
you're
gonna
make
it
but
i
told
my
friends
how
i
felt
and
you
know
what
it
got
a
little
better
suddenly
a
vampire
jumps
down
behind
buffy
and
swings
at
her
head
but
she
middle
blocks
it
and
punches
him
in
the
face
which
sends
him
to
the
pavement
on
his
side
buffy
punches
him
in
the
face
while
he's
down
reaches
for
his
shirt
and
yanks
him
back
up
to
his
feet
she
spins
him
around
and
lets
go
of
his
shirt
he
staggers
backward
a
couple
of
steps
but
keeps
his
footing
he
advances
and
does
two
roundhouse
kicks
which
buffy
low
blocks
he
tries
a
wide
punch
to
buffy's
head
but
she
ducks
it
and
rises
back
up
to
deliver
a
roundhouse
kick
to
his
side
this
sends
him
stumbling
backward
right
at
cordelia
cordelia
look
cordelia
has
no
time
to
react
and
gets
knocked
into
a
pile
of
garbage
out
the
vampire
gets
back
up
to
his
feet
and
comes
at
buffy
jumping
into
a
half
spinning
crescent
kick
which
buffy
easily
ducks
she
grabs
him
when
he
comes
at
her
again
and
knees
him
in
the
stomach
then
flips
him
over
onto
his
back
she
pulls
out
her
stake
and
jams
it
home
the
vampire
bursts
into
ashes
buffy
turns
her
attention
back
to
cordelia
who
flicks
a
few
pieces
of
trash
from
her
dress
and
slowly
climbs
out
of
the
garbage
heap
buffy
looks
at
her
apologetically
behind
her
she
hears
the
laughter
of
a
group
of
girls
so
she
quickly
tosses
aside
her
stake
harmony
and
some
of
her
friends
walk
by
look
cordelia
over
and
keep
laughing
as
they
go
after
they've
gone
cordelia
vents
on
buffy
you
know
what
i've
been
asking
myself
a
lot
this
last
week
why
me
why
do
i
get
impaled
why
do
i
get
bitten
by
snakes
why
do
i
fall
for
incredible
losers
and
you
know
i
think
i've
finally
figured
it
out
what
my
problem
is
it's
cut
to
the
quad
at
school
the
next
day
cordelia
and
anya
walk
together
buffy
summers
that's
when
all
my
troubles
started
cordelia
winces
in
pain
and
holds
her
side
when
she
moved
here
are
you
okay
oh
i
just
pulled
some
stitches
last
night
know
why
cordelia
looks
in
buffy's
direction
surprise
it
was
buffy's
fault
anya
follows
cordelia's
gaze
and
sees
buffy
and
company
sitting
on
a
bench
harmony
interrupts
cordelia
and
anya
oh
hey
it's
garbage
girl
loved
the
look
last
night
cor
dumpster
chic
for
the
dumped
she
and
her
troop
rudely
walk
right
between
cordelia
and
anya
giggling
and
smiling
cordelia
looks
down
in
embarrassment
anya
takes
her
pendant
off
here
i
think
you
need
this
more
than
i
do
right
now
cordelia
lifts
her
hair
away
from
her
neck
and
lets
anya
put
it
on
yeah
i
can
use
some
luck
cordelia
eyes
buffy
and
a
stick
with
pointy
sharp
bits
if
that
buffy
wasn't
i
swear
she's
a
pain
but
xander
he's
an
utter
loser
don't
you
wish
i
never
would've
looked
twice
at
xander
if
buffy
hadn't
made
him
marginally
cooler
by
hanging
with
him
really
anya
looks
over
at
buffy
yeah
i
swear
i
wish
buffy
summers
had
never
come
to
sunnydale
anya
turns
back
to
cordelia
who
gasps
to
see
that
her
face
has
suddenly
become
very
wrinkled
and
rawlooking
the
embodiment
of
anyanka
patron
saint
of
all
women
scorned
done
the
picture
fades
to
white
part
2

the
picture
fades
from
white
back
to
the
quad
at
sunnydale
high
cordelia
looks
around
her
anya
is
gone
buffy
willow
and
xander
are
not
sitting
at
the
bench
anymore
there
are
far
fewer
students
in
general
the
place
is
in
fact
rather
a
mess
garbage
and
palm
leaves
are
strewn
about
the
quad
anya
suddenly
she
notices
that
she
no
longer
has
her
injury
anya's
pendant
however
is
still
around
her
neck
slowly
she
begins
to
figure
it
out
'i
wish
buffy
summers
had
never
come
to
sunnydale'
cordelia
smiles
she
was
like
a
good
fairy
a
scary
veiny
good
fairy
smiles
widely
she
laughs
as
she
heads
into
the
halls
cut
into
the
halls
just
like
outside
there
are
far
fewer
students
inside
everyone
is
dressed
in
dark
and
drab
clothing
cordelia
is
the
standout
in
her
bright
turquoise
dress
she
sees
harmony
and
her
friends
at
her
locker
and
hesitates
harmony
closes
her
locker
and
sees
her
where
have
you
been
she
approaches
cordelia
and
her
friends
follow
cordelia
gives
them
a
careful
smile

harmony
nods
in
agreement
john
lee
walks
up
to
them
cordelia

john
lee
pulls
her
aside
look
every
guy

probably
asked
but
if

the
winter
brunch

be
honored
and
we'd
have
fun
cordelia
considers
her
response

get
back
to
you

heads
down
the
hall
a
happy
man
harmony

over
to
her
cordy

so
what's
with
the
winter
brunch

less
than
half
full
but
even
so
most
of
the
students

toward
the
back
the
bell
rings
the
teacher
hurriedly
gathers
his
things

have
our
uh
monthly
memorial
so
uh
there's
no
class
he
rushes
out
of
the
room
the
students
also
make
a
point
of
getting
out
of
there
quickly
what's
the
rush

my
mom

the
bronze

and
give
cordelia
a
disbelieving
look
is
that
a
joke
oh
the
bronze

cool
in
this
reality
i've
gotta
make
these
little
adjustments
cordelia
smiles
harmony
and
cordette
exchange
a
look
cordy
what's
with
you
harmony
the
others
leave
i
mean
you

little
schizo

right
i
just
well
i
bumped
my
head
yesterday
and
i
keep
forgetting
stuff
not
that
i
care
but
xander
harris
he's
miserable
right
and
that
willow
freak
he
hangs
with
not
even
a
blip
on
the
radar
screen
right
cordelia
smiles
harmony
confused
well
yeah
they're
dead
cordelia's
smile
fades
not
at
all
sure
how
she
feels
about
that
harmony
rolls
her
eyes
and
leaves
the
room
cut
to
what
cordelia
thinks
is
the
student
parking
lot
the
lot
is
completely
empty
and
full
of
fallen
leaves
okay
not
funny
cordelia
stops
a
passing
janitor
hey
you
where
did
you
put
my
car
pardon
my
auto
el
convertablo
you
students
aren't
allowed
to
drive
and
you
know
it
what
go
on
now
miss
you
better
get
in
before
the
sun
sets
the
janitor
hurries
off
cordelia
is
now
very
confused
she
starts
on
her
way
home
cut
to
a
street
in
town
the
sun
cinema
is
closed
the
last
shop
pulls
a
metal
gate
across
its
storefront
the
street
is
dirty
a
smashed
car
just
sits
in
the
middle
of
it
in
the
distance
cordelia
can
hear
sirens
and
screams
as
she
walks
along
suddenly
xander
appears
in
front
of
her
wearing
only
a
white
tshirt
and
black
leather
jacket
and
pants
she
startles
and
stops
short
well
whadaya
know
cordelia
chase
what
is
this
some
kind
of
sick
joke
harmony
told
me
you
were
dead
xander
plays
her
game
now
why
would
she
say
something
like
that
let's
think
listen
to
me
we
have
to
find
buffy
she'll
figure
out
a
way
to
save
us
she
was
supposed
to
be
here
and
as
much
as
it
kills
me
to
admit
it
things
were
better
when
she
was
around
buffy
the
slayer
no
buffy
the
dogfaced
girl
duh
who
do
you
think
i'm
talking
about
bored
now
she
slowly
walks
up
to
them
she
is
also
dressed
in
black
leather
the
bodice
of
her
outfit
is
trimmed
in
red
lace
this
is
the
part
that's
less
fun
when
there
isn't
any
screaming
what's
up
with
you
two
and
the
leather
willow
to
xander
play
now
it's
not
that
i
don't
appreciate
your
appetite
will
but
i
thought
we
agreed
it
was
my
turn
willow
whines
and
brushes
her
hand
against
xander's
chest
no
no
no
way
i
wish
us
into
bizarro
land
and
you
guys
are
still
together
i
cannot
win
probably
not
xander
vamps
out
but
i'll
give
you
a
head
start
cordelia
gasps
no
she
drops
her
bag
and
begins
to
run
i
love
this
part
they
kiss
passionately
with
lots
of
tongue
then
xander
turns
his
attention
to
the
chase
you
love
all
the
parts
willow
follows
at
a
walk
as
xander
runs
after
cordelia
he
jumps
up
runs
over
the
smashed
car
and
jumps
down
behind
her
grabs
her
by
the
neck
and
throws
her
down
to
the
street
she
rolls
to
a
stop
unconscious
no
fun
she
didn't
even
hardly
fight
suddenly
a
van
comes
screeching
around
the
corner
aw
swell
it's
the
white
hats
the
van
screeches
to
a
stop
next
to
cordelia
and
giles
jumps
out

large
cross
in
hand
to
ward
them

wearing
that
everyone
knows
that
vampires
are
attracted

to
the

several
cages
containing
terrified
humans
suspended
a
few
feet
from
the
floor
willow
reaches
in
to
one
and
strokes
his
cheek
they
head
toward
the
back
of
the
club
past
the
pool

where
a
vampire
has
a
wayward
biker

man's
chest

to
the
vampire

and
xander
and
willow
continue
into
the
back
a
guard
vampire
holds
the
curtain
aside
for
them
to
enter
when
he
sees
them
come
in
the
master

from
his
throne
his
two
favored
vampires
come
to
stand
before
him

grabs
a
girl
by
the
hair
and
lifts
her
by
it
the
girl
remains
silent
with
fear
but
keeps
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
master

disgustedly
i've
lost
my
appetite
for
this
one
she
keeps
looking
at

trying
to

looks
at

he
notices
willow's
desire
for
a

and
turns
the
girl's
head
toward
her

up
at
xander

out
the
master
shoves
the
girl
over
to
her
she
catches
her
in
her
arms
with
her
head
laid

bites
her
hard

her
zest
for
a

goes
against
our
nature
they

is
our
art
