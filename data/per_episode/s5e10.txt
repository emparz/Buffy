a
look
with

riley
buffy
leans
her
head
back
and
sighs
loudly
riley
puts
his
hand
on
her
knee
i
can't
stand
this
what's
taking
so
long
it
doesn't
mean
anything
you
think
i'd
worry
more
if
your
mom
was
out
of
surgery
quickly
might
mean
that
you
know
they
couldn't
do
much
buffy
frowns
looks
down
at
dawn
looks
up
suddenly
she
puts
her
hand
over
riley's
which
is
still
on
her
leg
shot
of
the
hospital
corridor
we
see
the
doctor
walking
toward
us
dawn
wakes
up
as
buffy
slides
out
from
under
her
everyone
stands
up
the
doctor
walks
closer
zoom
in
on
buffy
nervously
waiting
for
the
news
with
riley
and
dawn
behind
her
wolf
howl
opening
credits
act
i

fade
back
in
on
the
hospital
scene
okay
your
mom's
in
recovery
what
happened
is
she
all
right
it
was
possible
to
visualize
the
tumor
completely
which
means
i
was
able
to
get
all
of
it
so
barring
complications
in
recovery
i
think
your
mother's
going
to
be
fine
dr
kriegel
everyone
reacts
with
relief
of
course
we're
still
going
to
have
to
watch
your
mother
carefully
and
uh
have
her
back
in
here
for
some
followup
testing
dr
kriegel
buffy
nods
but
uh
overall
i'd
consider
the
procedure
a
complete
success
smiles
all
round
everyone
hugs
each
other
giles
and
xander
start
to
hug
then
settle
for
a
handshake
instead
buffy
hugging
riley
oh
my
goodness
doctor
thank
you
thank
you
so
much
please
it's
my
pleasure
buffy
hugs
him
and
he
yells
in
pain
as
she
forgets
her
slayerstrength
she
gasps
and
pulls
back
sorry
sorry
the
doctor
puts
a
hand
on
his
back
and
gives
buffy
a
funny
look
cut
to
exterior
shot
of
xander's
apartment
building
night
cut
to
interior
of
xander's
apartment
xander
anya
and
dawn
are
eating
chinese
food
around
a
low
table
when
i
was
younger
i
used
to
put
my
chopsticks
in
my
mouth
like
this
dawn
she
puts
chopsticks
into
her
mouth
so
they
stick
out
like
very
long
fangs
and
then
buffy
would
chase
me
around
the
house
yelling
dawn
makes
claw
hands
'i'm
the
slayer
i'm
going
to
get
you'
dawn
laughs
that's
disturbing
you're
emotionally
scarred
and
will
end
up
badly
dawn
removes
chopsticks
no
it
was
great
i
mean
she
didn't
actually
stake
me
in
the
heart
you
know
buffy's
pretty
cool
like
that
xander
gets
up
to
clear
the
dishes
so
what
do
you
wanna
do
now
dawnster
keeping
in
mind
that
i
won't
chase
you
because
i'm
old
and
i'm
stuffed
full
of
moo
goo
gai
starch
dawn
starts
to
reply
but
anya
interrupts
well
we
could
play
that
game
again
life
that
was
fun
dawn
frowns
for
you
you
always
win
well
we
can
make
a
wager
this
time
you
can
give
me
real
money
that
would
be
different
xander
sarcastic
and
after
we
teach
her
to
gamble
maybe
we
can
all
get
drunk
anya
not
getting
it
i
don't
think
the
bar
would
serve
her
but
we
could
bring
something
in
anya
to
dawn
strawberry
schnapps
taste
just
like
real
ice
cream
okay
how's
about
a
movie
xander
opens
the
newspaper
and
walks
back
to
them
they're
showing
them
in
theaters
now
i
hear
it's
like
watching
a
video
with
a
bunch
of
strangers
and
a
sticky
floor
xander
he
lays
out
the
newspaper
where
he
and
dawn
can
both
look
at
it
dawn
points
that
one
looks
sad
the
chimp
playing
hockey
is
that
based
on
the
chekhov
anya
comes
running
over
and
grabs
the
paper
eagerly
there's
a
chimp
playing
hockey
um
no
the
other
one
i
don't
wanna
see
a
sad
movie
we
have
to
see
the
chimp
playing
hockey
that's
hilarious
the
ice
is
so
slippery
and
and
monkeys
are
all
irrational
we
have
to
see
this
you
pick
dawn
this
is
your
night
we
are
celebrating
your
mom's
good
news
anya
looks
chastised
anya
softly
go
monkey

monkey
it's
okay
you
guys
don't
have
to
make
a
big
deal
for
me
i'm
only
sleeping
over
here
so
buffy
and
riley
can
boink
xander
looks
embarrassed
no
that's
not
that's
not
it
at
all
they
just
need
time
to
uh
xander
clears
throat
be
tender
relax
anya
smiles
and
rubs
xander's
chest
anya
to
dawn
he's
not
very
convincing
is
he
dawn
shakes
her
head
in
agreement
'alone
time'
always
translates
into
'get
dawn
out
of
the
house
so
we
can
have
loud
obnoxious
sex'
xander
looks
like
he
wants
to
object
but
doesn't
anya
smiles
then
suddenly
realizes
something
anya
softly
to
xander
oh
does
that
mean
we
can't
xander
gives
her
a
look
cut
to
candles
burning
on
a
mantle
soft
romantic
music
pan
over
to
buffy
and
riley
dancing
in
the
darkened
summers
home
can
we
put
this
song
on
repeat
whatever
you
want
can
we
put
the
whole
night
on
repeat

good
buffy
sighs
happily

tension's
just

was
a
lot

were
incredible
buffy
smiles
not
really
just
covering
for
the
weepy
chicken
within

strong
throughout
buffy

she
lifts
her
head
up
and

a
small
bandage
on

buffy
raises
her
eyebrows
to
indicate
that
she
can't
get
dressed
with
spike
watching
he
scoffs
oh

he
turns
his
back
and
then
makes
an
agonized
face
forcing
himself
not
to
look
as
buffy
reaches
for
her
clothing
cut
to
spike
leading
buffy
through
the

buffy
through
the
mess
to
a
slightly

something
obscured
by
giles's
arm
are
coming
we
see
xander
anya
and
willow
behind
the
counter
unpacking
merchandise
and
so
it
begins
he
steps
down
from
his
footstool
and
we
see
that
the
last
holiday
listed
is
'gurnenthar's
ascendance'
no
longer
a
victim
of
crass
holiday
commercialization
i'm
a
purveyor
of
it
anya
takes
a
jar
out
of
a
box
willow
moves
out
from
behind
the
counter
oh
who
ordered
more
chickens'
feet
the
ones
we
have
aren't
moving
at
all
that's
generally
what
happens
when
you
cut
them
off
the
chicken
i'm
serious
anya
opens
jar
maybe
we
could
do
a
holiday
promotion
anya
takes
out
a
chicken
foot
one
free
with
every
purchase
anya
smiles
oh
yeah
giles
nostalgically
dear
holiday
memories
merry
tykes
by
the
fire
enjoying
their
new
christmas
chicken
feet
willow
comes
up
beside
giles
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
counter
from
anya
aw
holding
them
tight
as
they
fall
asleep
painting
their
little
toenails
willow
and
giles
laugh
xander
grins
anya
grins
too
though
she
is
not
amused
that's
so
very
humorous
make
fun
of
the
exdemon
i
can
just
hear
you
in
private
anya
talks
to
the
chicken
foot
'i
dislike
that
anya
she's
newly
human
and
strangely
literal'
willow
anya
frowns
anya
i
don't
say
that
no
one
says
that
no
one
talks
that
way
there's
nothing
wrong
with
my
idea
anyway
i've
been
very
good
for
this
store
anya
frowns
if
it
wasn't
for
me
giles
would
be
a
terrified
old
man
staring
at
a
quarterly
tax
statement
and
wetting
himself
giles
insulted
i
say
that's
an
exaggeration
anya
you've
helped
out
a
lot
but
i
have
too
anya
opening
another
jar
yes
i
forgot
about
all
the
vigorous
sitting
around
anya
you
can
back
off
a
little
you
get
paid
willow's
doing
this
on
her
own
time
willow
smiles
and
nods
triumphantly
anya
with
a
fake
smile
i'm
sorry
willow
thank
you
for
making
time
in
your
busy
life
to
come
in
here
and
get
in
the
way
of
mine
xander
annoyed
anya
play
nice
you
know
fine
take
her
side
instead
of
mine
anya
xander
sighs
puts
his
hands
over
his
face
even
though
i'm
the
one
who
sleeps
with
you
and
feeds
you
bathes
you
willow
frowns
willow
to
xander
she
bathes
you
only
in
an
erotic
penthousey
way
not
in
a
spongebathy
geriatric
sort
of
giles
puts
up
a
hand
please
stop
i
beg
of
you
they
all
look
up
as
the
door
opens
it
has
bells
that
jingle
when
it
moves
and
buffy
enters
she
has
a
bag
over
her
shoulder
she
strides
purposefully
over
to
the
counter
i
need
to
find
out
everything
i
can
about
a
vamp
nest
downtown
a
nest
what
sort
of
buffy
there
were
people
there
it
um
it
looked
like
they
were
paying
vampires
to
bite
them
giles
looks
shocked
now
i
know
what
to
get
for
the
person
who
has
everything
who
would
pay
to
get
bitten
oh
that's
been
going
on
for
centuries
humans
hire
vampires
to
feed
off
them
they
well
you
know
theythey
get
off
on
the
rush
and
the
hazards
of
the
underworld
can
become
addictive
to
some
people
why
don't
the
vampires
just
kill
'em
because
they
get
cash
hot
and
cold
running
blood
and
they
don't
leave
any
corpses
behind
so
they
don't
get
hunted
but
still
iit
can
be
terribly
dangerous
for
humans
i
mean
people
can
end
up
dying
accidentally
or
or
meeting
a
a
vampire
who
only
pretends
to
play
by
the
house
rules
buffy
angrily
you
knew
about
this
and
you
didn't
tell
me
i
hadn't
seen
it
since
my
ripper
days
i
had
no
idea
it
was
going
on
in
sunnydale
well
it
is
buffy
giles
frowns
and
i'm
gonna
stop
it
she
turns
toward
a
large
trunk
and
opens
it
revealing
a
stash
of
weapons
buffy
even
if
i
had
known
about
this
i
might
not
have
told
you
right
now
buffy
whirls
around
what
why
well
i'm
not
sure
this
is
where
your
efforts
are
best
spent
perhaps
you
should
focus
on
a
less
ambiguous
evil
glory
for
instance
you
said
people
are
dying
they're
willing
victims
i
mean
there
are
people
out
there
who
deserve
your
help
who
aren't
vampires
are
vampires
and
my
job
description
is
pretty
clear
buffy
they
all
look
uneasy
are
you
coming
with
me
or
not
what's
the
rush
buff
if
we're
going
into
a
nest
maybe
we
should
come
up
with
a
strategy
wait
for
riley
buffy
scowls
in
extreme
displeasure
back
me
up
or
not
i'm
going
she
stalks
out
giles
looks
conflicted
but
he
and
xander
begin
to
collect
their
things
anya
will
you
mind
the
store
anya
nods
the
others
gather
up
jackets
and
stakes
and
leave
anya
watches
them
go
with
a
smile
have
a
nice
day
don't
get
killed
the
bell
jingles
as
they
exit
cut
to
inside
the
warehouse
buffy
and
giles
are
coming
down
the
interior
stairs
i
don't
understand
this
place
was
doing
serious
business
last
night
we
see
that
the
place
is
deserted
willow
and
xander
are
on
the
main
floor
a
small
grill
sits
on
a
table
with
a
fire
burning
in
it
well
i
guess
everybody
jumped
ship
once
the
word
got
out
that
the
slayer
found
their
crib
xander
pauses
i
just
want
to
apologize
for
the
use
of
the
word
'crib'
buffy
xander
to
giles
do
you
think
they'll
set
up
shop
again
in
town
it's
hard
to
say
i'm
sure
they'll
lie
low
for
a
bit
but
they're
around
somewhere
there's
gotta
be
a
way
to
find
these
creeps
don't
worry
buff
you'll
find
them
yeah
i'm
sure
you'll
get
them
next
time
champ
buffy
does
her
angry
expression
again
she
grabs
the
grill
and
throws
it
against
a
wall
the
fire
begins
to
spread
buffy
stalks
out
as
the
others
stare
at
her
willow
follows
in
her
footsteps
xander
and
giles
follow
more
slowly
looking
concerned
cut
to
spike
sitting
in
his
armchair
in
his
crypt
holding
a
bottle
of
alcohol
he
pulls
out
the
cork
sighs
and
lifts
the
bottle
to
take
a
swig
the
door
bursts
open
and
riley
enters
what
took
you
spike
puts
the
cork
back
in
and
sets
the
bottle
aside
guess
it
takes
a
while
to
get
back
to
full
strength
after
those
bites
riley
grabs
spike
by
the
shirt
and
pulls
him
up
out
of
the
chair
hey
hey
let's
be
reasonable
about
this
riley
slams
him
up
against
a
pillar
you
may
have
noticed
spike
riley
punches
spike
in
the
face
i
left
reasonable
about
three
exits
back
look
i'm
not
the
one
who
got
you
into
this
don't
kill
the
messenger
riley
scowls
he
pulls
back
his
arm
and
we
see
there's
a
stake
in
his
hand
he
plunges
it
into
spike's
chest
spike
gasps
why
the
hell
not
blackout
act
iii

fade
back
in
on
riley
holding
the
stake
in
spike's
chest
spike
yelling
ow
bloody
hell
oh

spike
quieter
hey
he
looks
down
at
his
chest
as
he
realizes
he
hasn't
been
dusted
yet
riley
yanks
the
stake
out
spike
grabs
his
chest
in
pain
and
stares
at
the
stake
plastic
woodgrain
looks
real
doesn't
it
riley
grabs
spike's
shirt
again
don't

i
don't

next
time
he
pats
spike
on
the
cheek
and
walks
away
spike
leans
against
the
pillar
panting
he's
still
clutching
his
chest
but
he
begins
to
chuckle
and
riley
turns
back
spike
chuckling
oh

under
it

riley
angrily
what

back
toward
spike
because

not
your
problem
even
if

wasn't
in
the
picture

never
gonna
be
able
to
hold
onto
her
riley
puts
his
hand
over
spike's
hand
that
is
covering
the
wound

pushes
his
hand

panting
the
girl

monster
in
her
man
and
that's
not
in
your
nature
spike
he
pushes
away
from
the
pillar

holding
his
chest
and
goes
to
sit
in
his
chair
no

sits
back
with
an
expression
of
pain

a
sip

quietly

spike
sighs
to
be
that
close
to
her
and
not
have
her
to
be
all
alone
even
when
you're
holding
her
feeling
her

swig
they
sit
there
together
cut
to
buffy
in
her
workout
room
beating
on
a
punching
bag
she
grunts
angrily
and
scowls
as
she
punches
over
and
over
cut
to
the
main
room
of
the
magic
shop
anya
is
going
over
paperwork
behind
the
counter
xander
stands
on
the
other
side
of
the
counter
looking
toward
the
back
room
how
long
has
she
been
in
there
a
while
now
seems
pretty
gungho
about
it
too
didn't
even
stop
to
say
hello
yeah
when
we
went
to
deal
with
that
vampire
nest
she
got
all
rambo
and
torched
the
place
xander
anya
looks
up
something
seriously
bad
is
going
on
with
her
oh
i
don't
know
maybe
you're
overreacting
i
mean
who
hasn't
done
stuff
like
that
from
time
to
time
i
mean
i
made
this
one
guy
spontaneously
combust
anya
the
doorbell
jingles
and
he
set
his
whole
village
on
fire
we
see
riley
entering
can
you
stop
being
scary
for
a
minute
and
listen
to
what
i'm
trying
to
tell
you
riley
approaches
and
xander
turns
to
face
him
riley
nods
toward
the
back
she
in
there
she's
training
riley
nods
would
you
guys
mind
clearing
out
i
need
a
minute
alone
with
her
xander
nods
goes
to
get
his
jacket
anya
to
riley
a
little
afterhours
hankypanky
in
the
training
room
huh
anya
she
comes
out
from
behind
the
counter
as
riley
walks
toward
the
back
boy
xander
and
i
could
tell
you
some
stories
not
now
let's
go
anya
xander
he
and
anya
begin
walking
out
anya
calling
over
her
shoulder
there's
a
funny
thing
with
the
vaulting
horse
that
you
can
tr
anya
what
he
started
it
in
your
world
maybe
but
where
the
people
are
this
isn't
the
time
for
'tales
of
anya
and
xander's
sexcapades'
anya
oh
xander
stops
walking
and
turns
to
him
uh
well
maybe
we
can
go
home
and
you
know
have
'em
actually
i've
got
some
stuff
to
take
care
of
he
walks
past
her
and
opens
the
door
to
leave
anya
follows
him
cut
to
buffy
still
punching
riley
walks
in
behind
her
we
need
to
talk
buffy
continues
punching
i'm
not
ready
to
talk
to
you
yet
riley
walks
forward
removing
his
jacket
and
tossing
it
aside
too
bad
he
takes
hold
of
the
punching
bag
buffy
stops
punching
i'm
serious
buffy
turns
away
unless
you
wanna
fight
so
let's
fight
we
need
to
have
this
out
buffy
right
now
buffy
turns
back
annoyed
and
say
what
riley
'what
were
you
thinking
how
long
have
you
been
lying
to
me'
nothing
you
say
right
now
is
gonna
make
this
better
she
turns
away
again
riley
moves
forward
i
realize
that
riley
grabs
her
arm
and
turns
her
around
i
don't
expect
riley
angrily
i
just
need
you
to
hear
me
out
buffy
quietly
fine
get
your
hand
off
of
me
he
lets
go
of
her
arm
sighs
walks
a
few
steps
away
i
think
when
this
thing
started
it
was
just
some
stupid
immature
game
i
wanted
to
even
the
score
after
you
let
dracula
bite
you
i
did
not
let
dracula
riley
i
know
on
some
level
i
know
that
but
i
was
still
spun
buffy
pause
i
don't
know
i
i
wanted
to
know
what
you
felt
i
wanted
to
know
why
dracula
and
angel
have
so
much
power
over
you
buffy
shakes
her
head
you
so
don't
get
it
i
wanted
to
get
it
buffy
i
wanted
to
get
you
so
this
is
my
fault
hey
gee
buffy's
so
mysterious
i
think
i'll
go
out
and
almost
die
i
think
i'll
go
and
let
some
other
w
buffy
she
stops
and
looks
down
this
isn't
your
fault
it's
mine
i
feel
like
hell
for
what
i've
put
you
through
riley
buffy
still
doesn't
look
at
him
it's
just
riley
sighs
these
girls
buffy
vampires
killers
they
made
me
feel
something
buffy
something
i
didn't
even
know
i
was
missing
until
buffy
i
can't
i
can't
hear
this
she
turns
away
again
and
riley
grabs
her
arm
again
you
need
to

this
buffy
pulls
her
arm
away
walks
a
few
steps
away
fine
fine

me

whores
tell
me
what
on
earth
they
were
giving
you
that
i
can't
they
needed
me
they
needed
your
money
it
wasn't
about
you
riley
walks
closer
to
her
no
on
some
basic
level
it
was
about
me
my
blood
my
body
riley
sighs
when
they
bit
me
it
was
beyond
passion
they
wanted
to
devour
me
all
of
me
buffy
teary
why
are
you
telling
me
this
it
wasn't
real
i
know
it
was
just
physical
but
the
fact
that
i
craved
it
that
that
i
kept
going
back
even
if
it
was
fleeting
they
made
me
feel
like
they
had
such
hunger
for
me
and
i
don't
make
you
feel
that
way
buffy
riley
looks
away
how
on
earth
can
you
compare
me
to
that
how
can
you
tell
me
you
understand
what
those
vampires
are
feeling
you
aren't
a
passion
to
them
you
are
a
snack
a
willing
idiotic
snack
riley
angrily
no
i
know
exactly
what
they
feel
when
they
bite
me
because
i
feel
it
every
time
we're
together
it's
like
the
whole
world
falls
away
and
all
there
is
is
you
and
you
think
that
i
don't
feel
the
same
way
about
you
how
dare
you
tell
me
what
i
feel
you
keep
me
at
a
distance
buffy
you
didn't
even
call
me
when
your
mom
went
into
the
hospital
buffy
incredulously
oh
i'm
sorry
you
know
um
i'm
sorry
that
i
couldn't
take
care
of
you
when
i
thought
that
my
mother
was
dying
it's
about
me
taking
care
of
you
it's
about
letting
me
in
so
you
don't
have
to
be
on
top
of
everything
all
the
time
but
i
do
that's
part
of
what
being
a
slayer
is
buffy
shakes
her
head
and
that's
what
this
is
really
about
isn't
it
you
can't
handle
the
fact
that
i'm
stronger
than
you
it's
hard
sometimes
yeah
but
that's
not
it
then
what
what
else
do
you
want
from
me
riley
i've
given
you
everything
that
i
have
i've
given
you
my
heart
my
body
and
soul
you
say
that
but
i
don't
feel
it
i
just
don't
feel
it
well
whose
fault
is
that
because
i'm
telling
you
this
is
it
this
is
me
this
is
the
package
and
if
it's
so
deficient
that
you
need
to
get
your
kicks
elsewhere
then
we
really
have
a
problem
they
both
stare
at
each
other
silently
for
a
moment
then
buffy
looks
down
riley
sighs
they
want
me
back

the
one
who
was
drinking
from

buffy
slowly
lowers
the
staff
the
vampire
looks
surprised
then
turns
and
begins
to
run
away
down
the
alley
buffy
stands
there
looking
thoughtful
after
a
moment
she
lifts
the
staff
and
throws
it
like
a
javelin
it
flies
down
the
alley
and
dusts
the
female
vamp
as
she's
running
buffy
stands
there
staring
down
the
alley
someone
comes
up
behind
her
so
how'd
that
work
out
for
ya
buffy
turns
to
see
xander
emerging
from
the
shadows
make
you
feel
better
what
are
you
doing
here
i
thought
you
might
need
to
talk
then
i
saw
the
skirmish

i
was
gonna
lend
a
hand
but
i
noticed
you
grew
a
few
extra
ones
buffy
angrily
go

xander
she
turns
and
starts
to
stride
away
buffy
buffy
turns
back
i'm
serious
so

i
something's
up

acting
like
a
crazy
person
buffy
turns
and
begins
walking
away
again
xander
follows
buffy
pushes
aside
a
large
metal
door
and
enters
a
random
building
xander
enters
after
her
cut
to
interior
of
another
warehouse
boxes
and
metal
cans
are
stacked
neatly
on
metal
shelving
buffy
walks
over
to
a
set
of
shelves
backed
by
a
metal
grating
and
leans
her
face
against
it
xander
walks
in
behind
her
take
this
for
instance
you
don't
wanna
deal
so
you
hide
it's
not
very
slayerlike
just
leave
me
alone
xander
you
have
no
idea
what's
going
on
no
good
so
you
and
riley
aren't
imploding
xander
buffy
turns
to
face
him
in
surprise
it
doesn't
take
a
genius
what
i
can't
figure
out
is
how
you
never
saw
it
coming
what
who
told
you
nobody
told
me
anything
buffy
it
was
right
in
front
of
my
xander
face
the
guy
would
do
anything
for
you
the
guy
got
himself
bit
by
a
vampire
buffy
xander
is
surprised
he
lied
to
me
he
ran
around
behind
my
back
and
almost
got
himself
killed
and
now
he
tells
me
that
he's
leaving
with
some
covert
military
operation
at
midnight
unless
i
convince
him
not
to
now
tell
me
that
you
understand
because
i
sure
as
hell
don't
you
gonna
let
him
go
buffy
sighs
it's
not
my
decision
to
make
of
course
it
is
well
it's
not
fair
who
cares
if
it's
fair
in
about
twenty
minutes
riley's
gonna
disappear
maybe
forever
unless
you
do
something
to
stop
him
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
beg
him
to
stay
xander
in
disbelief
why
wouldn't
you
to
keep
riley
here
buffy
i
don't
even
know
who
he
is
anymore
i
mean
i
thought
he
was
dependable
dependable
what
is
he
state
farm
you
know
what
i
mean
yeah
i
think
you
mean
convenient
i
think
you
took
it
for
granted
that
he
was
gonna
show
up
when
you
wanted
him
to
and
take
off
when
you
didn't
look
who's
talking
look
who
has
anya
following
him
around
like
a
lovesick
puppy
oh
boy
is
this
not
about
me
is
she
more
than
a
convenience
'cause
that
would
kinda
be
a
surprise
xander
angrily
if
you
don't
wanna
hear
what
i
have
to
say
i'll
shut
up
right
now
good
'cause
i
don't
she
starts
to
walk
off
xander
intercepts
her
i
lied
see
what
i
think
you
got
burned
with
angel
then
riley
shows
up
i
know
the
story
xander
but
you
miss
the
point
you
shut
down
buffy
and
you've
been
treating
riley
like
the
rebound
guy
when
he's
the
one
that
comes
along
once
in
a
lifetime
xander
buffy
looks
dismayed
he's
never
held
back
with
you
he's
risked
everything
and
you're
about
to
let
him
fly
because
you
don't
like
ultimatums
buffy's
eyes
begin
to
water
as
xander's
words
finally
get
through
if
he's
not
the
guy
if
what
he
needs
from
you
just
isn't
there
xander
shakes
head
let
him
go
break
his
heart
and
make
it
a
clean
break
but
if
you
really
think
you
can
love
this
guy
i'm
talking
scary
messy
noemotionsbarred
need
if
you're
ready
for
that
then
think
about
what
you're
about
to
lose
buffy
looks
up
at
him
then
looks
around
anxiously
there
are
tears
in
her
eyes
xander
run
she
turns
and
runs
out
xander
watches
as
the
door
slams
behind
her
cut
to
buffy
running
as
hard
as
she
can
down
the
main
street
of
sunnydale
her
expression
still
anxious
shot
of
riley
standing
next
to
a
helicopter
looking
around
buffy
runs
along
in
the
street
turns
a
corner
and
enters
a
more
residential
neighborhood
riley
continues
to
look
around
checks
his
watch
behind
him
the
helicopter
blades
begin
to
turn
slowly
buffy
runs
down
quiet
streets
riley
looks
at
the
ground
looking
very
disappointed
the
helicopter
blades
move
faster
and
faster
buffy
runs
through
a
foresty
area
and
down
some
wooden
stairs
riley
stares
at
the
two
trees
between
which
he
wants
buffy
to
appear
she
doesn't
he
turns
and
gets
into
the
helicopter
next
to
graham
buffy
runs
through
the
forest
and
comes
out
on
the
helipad
the
helicopter
is
already
off
the
ground
and
rising
fast
riley
riley
shot
of
riley
inside
the
helicopter
staring
grimly
out
the
front
window
behind
him
we
can
see
out
the
helicopter
door
and
we
see
buffy
on
the
ground
yelling
up
at
him
riley
riley
he
doesn't
hear
her
and
continues
to
stare
out
the
front
buffy
watches
as
the
helicopter
rises
and
flies
away
cut
to
buffy
walking
slowly
down
the
residential
streets
i've
gotta
say
something
cut
to
anya's
apartment
anya
is
in
her
nightgown
sitting
on
the
bed
'cause

don't
think
i've
made
it
clear
anya
stands
up
xander
walks
toward
her
i'm
in
love
with
you
he
walks
closer
toward
her
and
she
toward
him
powerfully
painfully
in
love
the
things
you
do
the
way
you
think
the
way
you
move
i
get
excited
every
time
i'm
about
to
see
you
they
are
up
close
now
looking
at
each
other
anya
smiles
slightly
looking
a
little
teary

make
me
feel
like
i've
never
felt
before
in
my
life
like
a
man
xander
pause
he
shrugs
uneasily
i
just
thought
you
might
wanna
know
anya
moves
up
to
him
and
they
kiss
cut
to
buffy
entering
the
dark
summers
house
she
walks
partway
up
the
stairs
and
then
sits
down
looking
sad
her
image
fades
into
the
image
of
riley
sitting
in
the
helicopter
with
the
dark
town
of
sunnydale
laid
out
below
him
