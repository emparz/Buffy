obviously
in
charge

was
a
puppet

of

willow
squeals
with
delight

buffy
smiles
stiffly
cut
to
the
park
a
picnic
table
stands
there
empty
suddenly
a
vampire
comes
crashing
down
onto
it
and
it
collapses
underneath
him
he
shakes
off
the
blow
as
he
gets
back
up
and
comes
at
buffy
again
she
grabs
the
metal
lid
from
a
trashcan
while
giles
looks
on
she
uses
it
as
a
shield
to
block
the
vampire's
punch
and
then
hits
him
over
the
head
with
it
he
falls
to
his
knee
but
gets
back
up
she
hits
him
with
it
again
and
he
falls
to
his
other
knee
and
quickly
gets
up
again
she
hits
him
a
third
time
and
he
staggers
again
buffy
ii
believe
he's
he's
um
buffy
swings
down
with
the
lid
from
above
onto
the
vampire's
head
he
just
absorbs
the
blow
and
comes
at
her
with
a
punch
she
blocks
the
swing
with
the
lid
again
and
swings
it
around
onto
his
head
from
above
again
giles
winces
at
what
he's
seeing
buffy
blocks
another
punch
then
discards
the
lid
and
kicks
the
vampire
in
the
face
it
it's
it's
staking
time
really
don't
you
think
buffy
kicks
the
vampire
again
and
follows
up
with
a
punch
to
the
jaw
giles
sits
down
on
a
bench
to
wait
holding
his
bag
in
his
lap
buffy
throws
a
right
jab
to
the
vampire's
face
she
follows
up
with
a
kick
to
his
knee
making
the
vampire
fall
to
the
ground
she
pulls
a
stake
out
of
her
jacket
and
cleanly
jams
it
into
his
chest
and
pulls
it
back
out
the
vampire
bursts
into
ashes
buffy
looks
around
as
she
walks
over
to
giles
any
others
well
for
their
sakes
i
certainly
hope
not
what
i
kill
vampires
that's
my
job
well
true
true
although
you
don't
usually
beat
them
into
quite
such
a
bloody
pulp
beforehand
everything
alright
yeah
fine
she
walks
around
him
steps
up
onto
the
bench
and
sits
on
the
backrest
i
killed
a
vampire
here
on
wednesday
why
are
they
hanging
out
at
the
park
well
they're
scattered
you
know
now
their
leaders
are
gone
with
any
luck
dead
in
times
of
crisis
they
usually
return
to
the
easiest
feeding
grounds
vampires
are
creeps
yes
that's
why
one
slays
them
i
mean
people
are
perfectly
happy
getting
along
and
then
vampires
come
and
they
run
around
and
they
kill
people
and
they
take
over
your
whole
house
they
start
making
these
stupid
little
mini
pizzas
and
everyone's
like
'i
like
your
mini
pizzas'
but
i'm
telling
you
i
am
giles
interrupts
uh
uh
buffy
ii
believe
the
subtext
here
is
is
rapidly
becoming
uh
giles
clears
his
throat
uh
text
are
you
sure
there's
nothing
you
want
to
share
no
forget
it
buffy
looks
around
again
think
there'll
be
anymore
ii
can
wait
cut
to
sunnydale
high
the
next
day
if
you
say
one
more
word
things
will
become
dire
cut
to
the
halls
xander
willow
and
buffy
are
walking
did
you
even
bother
to
taste
'em
nooo
well
i
did
and
i'm
here
to
tell
ya
those
mini
pizzas
have
changed
my
life
ted
is
the
master
chef
fine
so
he's
a
good
cook
well
what
does
that
really
tell
you
about
a
person
everything
you
don't
like
him
i
don't
know
him
i
i
mean
so
far
all
i
see
is
someone
who
apparently
has
a
good
job
seems
nice
and
polite
and
my
mother
really
likes
him
xander
in
a
rough
voice
what
kind
of
a
monster
is
he
i'm
just
saying
there's
something
a
little
too
clean
about
this
clown
willow
giggles
he's
a
clean
clown
willow
gets
stares
from
the
others
i
have
my
own
fun
they
arrive
at
the
vending
machines
buff
you're
lacking
evidence
i
think
maybe
we're
in
sigmund
freud
territory
he
puts
his
coins
into
the
machine
he
has
a
point
separation
anxiety
the
mother
figure
being
taken
away
conflict
with
the
father
figure
he's
not
my
father
figure
having
issues
much
i
am
not
xander
does
a
typical
funny
dance
pointing
both
fingers
at
buffy
and
responding
in
a
singsong
voice
you're
having
parental
issues
you're
having
parental
issues
xander
what
freud
would've
said
the
exact
same
thing
except
he
might
not
have
done
that
little
dance
okay
i
admit
it's
weird
seeing
my
mother
frenching
a
guy
is
definitely
a
ticket
to
therapy
land
but
it's
more
than
that
i'm
pretty
good
at
sensing
what's
going
on
around
me
and
there
is
definitely
something
wrong
with
this
ted
xander
spots
ted
coming
down
the
stairs
behind

out
of
the
room
with
his
head
hung
down
jenny

replacing
the
bandage
on
his

and
'ted

how
rare
it
is
to
find
a
man
that
cooks
i
know
i've
been
looking
a
long
time
for
one
so
buffy
i
bet
the
boys
are
lined
up
around
the
block
tryin'
to
get
a
date
with
you
not
really
oh
they
are
but
she's
only
interested
in
willow
gets
a
nudge
from
buffy
uh
her
studies
'bookcracker
buffy'
it's
kind
of
her
nickname
well
glad
to
hear
it
i
bet
that
means
your
grades
will
be
picking
up
soon
he
bends
down
to
position
his
ball
for
his
shot
my
grades
buffy
paces
over
to
her
mom
how
does
he
know
about
my
grades
i
told
him
he
wants
to
know
everything
about
you
he's
concerned
that's
a
good
thing
joyce
ted
makes
his
shot
ooo
nice
shot
ted
cut
to
the
next
hole
with
a
castle
buffy
is
ready
to
take
her
shot
keep
your
eye
on
the
ball
watch
those
elbows
buffy
swings
a
bit
too
hard
and
the
ball
ricochets
off
of
the
castle
and
into
the
rough
behind
it
oh
bad
luck
little
lady
buffy
starts
to
walk
to
retrieve
her
ball
for
another
try
oh
we
won't
count
it
we
won't
buffy
stops
and
turns
back
to
look
at
them
well
it's
just
miniature
golf
it
is
but
the
rules
are
the
rules
and
what
we
teach
her
is
what
she
takes
out
into
the
world
when
we're
not
there
whether
it's
at
school
or
an
unchaperoned
party
ted
to
buffy
i
don't
mean
to
overstep
my
bounds
this
is
between
you
and
your
mother
i
just
think
right
is
right
he
has
a
point
fine
i'll
just
go
hit
my
ball
from
the
rough
she
goes
over
to
her
ball
behind
the
castle
and
picks
it
up
she
steps
onto
the
green
and
thinking
no
one
sees
her
drops
her
ball
into
the
hole
buffy
loudly
hey
how
'bout
that
got
a
hole
in
two
beg
to
differ
buffy
turns
her
head
to
see
him
standing
next
to
the
castle
where
he
can
just
see
okay
so
fine
my
score
or
whatever
i
think
you're
missing
the
point
here
little
lady
right

right
wrong
is
wrong
why
don't
people
see
that
it's
just
a
game
right
it's

a
game
do
your
own
thing

not
wired
that
way
and
i
am
here
to
tell
you
ted
buffy
notices
how
he's
tapping
his
ankle
with
his
club
pretty
hard
it
is
not
a
game
it
does
count
and
i
don't
stand
for
that
kind
of
malarkey
in
my
house
then
i
guess
it's
a
good
thing
i'm
not
in
your
house
do
you
want
me
to
slap
that
smartass
mouth
of
yours
buffy
can't
believe

around
the
castle

follows

morning
at
the
summer's
house
cut
to
the
kitchen

wandering
in

the
orange
juice
from

refrigerator
and
brings
it
to

the
oj
i've

buffy
picks
up
part
of
a

ted

puts

back
down
joyce
smiles
what
i'd
just
like
to
eat
something
around
here
that
ted
didn't
make
oh
what
kind
of
an
attitude
is
that
buffy
exhales
look
mom
i
know
you
think
he's
great
and
all
but
i
joyce
pours
some
juice
y'know
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
be
nice
to
you
and
you
couldn't
say
two
words
to
him
on
saturday
joyce
pours
another
glass
i
do
not
expect
you
to
love
him
right
away
like
i
do
but
i
do
expect
you
to
treat
him
decently
you
love
him
joyce
puts
down
the
juice
carton
ii
don't
know
joyce
exhales
that
just
slipped
out
joyce
takes
the
juice
back
to
the
fridge
but
i
guess
i
mean
it's
not
exactly
like
men
beat
down
the
door
when
you're
a
single
when
you're
a
single
parent
joyce
exhales
honey
look
i
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
anybody
if
they
didn't
care
about
you
but
he
does
i
don't
understand
why
you
can't
see
that
he
threatened
me
what
joyce
comes
back
to
the
island
he
threatened
me
he
said
that
he
was
gonna
slap
my
face
joyce
disbelieving
he
said
no
such
thing
honey
ted
told
me
what

he
caught
you
cheating
didn't
he
buffy
exhales
yeah
i
kicked
my
ball
in
put
me
in
jail

he
totally
wigged
and
he
didn't
say
anything
about
it
in
front
of
the
others
did
he
uh
no
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
joyce
interrupts
well
i
thought
that
that
was
pretty
decent
of
him
ted
said
we
are
just
gonna
have
to
give
you
time
to
come
around

with
customers
over
their
headsets
yeah
iiit's
a
terrific
product
no

be
without
it
no
mrs
lawnsdale
it
is
not
an
inexpensive
piece
of
software
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
a
very
expensive
one
which
removes
the
risk
of
crashing
your
whole
system
of
course
if
you
prefer
something
cheap
i
can
always
recommend
trust
me
you
won't
be
sorry
thank
you
very
much
ted
takes
off
his
headset
and
puts
it
down
buffy

him
get
up
and
quickly
crouches
down
and
hides
under

back
at

she
exhales
frustrated
that

out
her
anger
and
decides
to
head
home
cut
inside

climbs
up
to

we
got
into
an
argument
about
what
he
um

this
the
first
time
that
you

ii
tried
to
take
it
back
aand
that's
when
he
hit
me
where
buffy
raises
her
hand
to
indicate
her
right
cheek
detective
stein
leans
over

have
a
look

i
think

also
shares
a
few
components
with
ecstasy

at

grabs
her
by
the
strap
of
her
coveralls
and
yanks
her
across
the
room
she
falls
into
her
desk
chair
a
good
salesman
always
bounces
back
cut
to
the
park
the
vampire
roars
and
attacks
jenny
screams
in
fright
and
jumps
aside
so
the
vampire
crashes
into
giles
grabbing
him
and
pulling
him
to
the
ground
with
him
giles
holds
his
cross
in
the
vampire's
face
giles
to
jenny
my
bag
jenny
jumps
over
to
the
dropped
bag
and
pulls
out
the
crossbow
giles
struggles
with
the
vampire
and
punches
him
in
the
face
but
the
vampire
isn't
fazed
giles
punches
him
again
harder
and
this
time
the
vampire
pulls
away
far
enough
for
giles
to
get
his
foot
underneath
him
to
push
him
off
the
vampire
lands
on
his
back
while
giles
scrambles
to
his
feet
the
vampire
jumps
up
and
starts
to
wrestle
with
giles
jenny
in
the
mean
time
has
loaded
a
bolt
into
the
crossbow
and
anxiously
looks
for
an
opening
they
turn
back
and
forth
not
giving
jenny
a
clear
shot
cut
to
buffy's
room
she
gets
to
her
feet
as
ted
comes
for
her
she
immediately
kicks
him
in
the
gut
and
follows
up
with
a
left
to
the
jaw
ted
flinches
but
doesn't
back
off
buffy
punches
him
twice
in
the
stomach
and
again
in
the
face
but
he
isn't
fazed
and
he
grabs
her
by
the
throat
and
backs
her
into
and
over
her
desk
pinning
her
against
the
wall
you
see
i
had
to
shut
down
for
a
while
to
get
you
off
my
back
you
should've
seen
the
intern's
face
when
i
got
up
off
the
table
it
was
a
hoot
fun's
over
though
he
wraps
his
other
hand
around
her
throat
and
begins
to
squeeze
cut
to
the
park
giles
and
the
vampire
continue
to
wrestle
constantly
turning
so
that
jenny
still
doesn't
have
a
clear
shot
at
one
point
the
turning
stops
and
jenny
decides
it's
time
for
her
to
shoot
say
good
night
big
guy
the
vampire
turns
giles
around
just
as
jenny
lets
the
bolt
fly
and
it
hits
giles
in
the
lower
left
of
his
back
ahhh
jenny
lowers
the
crossbow
and
looks
at
them
shocked
by
what
happened
oh
god
the
vampire
lets
go
of
giles
and
steps
back
giles
grabs
the
shaft
of
the
bolt
and
bends
over
in
pain
oh
no
she
bends
down
to
the
bag
and
searches
frantically
for
another
bolt
vampire
laughs
nice
shot
lady
giles
rends
the
bolt
from
his
back
and
jams
it
into
the
vampire's
chest
jenny
has
found
another
bolt
and
stands
back
up
to
see
giles
let
go
of
the
bolt
the
vampire
falls
to
the
ground
and
explodes
into
ashes
jenny
stares
in
shock
and
relief
at
what
she's
just
seen
cut
to
buffy's
room
ted
tightens
his
grip
on
buffy's
throat
she
looks
over
at
her
nightstand
for
anything
to
use
as
a
weapon
and
reaches
for
her
nail
file
that's
lying
there
she
grabs
it
and
stabs
ted
in
the
left
forearm
with
it
ted
yanks
his
arm
away
from
her
slicing
it
open
on
the
file
as
he
jerks
back
buffy
collapses
to
the
floor
that
wasn't
playing
fair
missy
he
grabs
his
left
wrist
with
his
right
hand
and
looks
down
at
the
wound
there
are
torn
wires
and
sparks
and
smoke
coming
from
it
you're
gonna
find
his
head
jerks
to
the
right
when
some
short
circuits
result
from
the
cut
hell
of
a
day
makes
you
feel
like
you're
eighteen
again
ted
his
head
jerks
back
that
i
don't
like
being
disobeyed
cut
downstairs
joyce
comes
out
of
the
basement
with
another
empty
box
and
closes
the
door
behind
her
cut
to
buffy's
room
ted
hears
the
sound
of
the
door
closing
downstairs
he
kicks
buffy
in
the
jaw
and
knocks
her
out
he
goes
to
her
door
opens
it
and
looks
out
into
the
hall
he
gives
buffy
another
look
as
he
pulls
his
sleeve
down
over
the
cut
in
his
arm
his
head
jerks
again
from
another
short
don't
worry
about
me
and
your
mother

gonna
be
very
happy
he
leaves
the
room
and
closes
and
locks
the
door
behind
him
cut
to
ted's
small
workshop
xander
looks
in
through
the
multipaned
window
and
sees
the
place
is
dark
and
empty
he
breaks
one
of
the
panes
with
a
crowbar
and
uses
it
to
knock
out
the
broken
glass
careful
xander
reaches
in
through
the
window
and
opens
the
door
from
inside
he
looks
in
as
willow
comes
to
stand
in
the
doorway
also
and
they
scan
around
the
place
with
their
flashlights
slowly
they
walk
in
with
cordelia
right
behind
them
let's
look
around

looks
over
the
paperwork

a
look
for

at
some
shelves
