faith's
body

buffy
buffyfaith
looks
at

she
raises
her
arms
out
of
the
water
to
examine

lifts
her
left
leg
straight
up

and
smiles
caressing
it
with
her
hands
faith
buffy
lowers
the
leg
back
in

water
and
scoops
two
handfuls
of
suds
and

her
face
she
relaxes
her
features
then
uses

index
fingers
to
push
her
eyebrows
high
on
her
forehead
next
she
opens
her
mouth
wide
to
stick
her
tongue

she
uses

index
fingers
to
raise
her
top
lip
looking
at

very
white
teeth

buffy
empathetically
because

buffy
walks
a
few
feet
away
from

with
her
hand
in
a
gun
shape

faith
buffy
leans
closer
to
the
mirror
as
a
voiceover
of
evil
laughter
is
heard

to
the
hospital
a
burly
male
nurse
comes
crashing
across

you'd
beg

a
little
bit
more
and
you

his
bottle
into
the
wall
and
walks
off
he
shoves
someone
and
clutches
his

cut
to
the
sewers
four
vampires
are
walking
in
vamp
face
it
was
too
crowded
we
gotta
hold
out
for
a
few
hours
pick
up
a
straggler
some
drunk
can't
be
calling
attention
to
vampire
sees
adam
and
stops
ourselves
i've
been
thinking
about
vampires
this
is
my
place
you're
place
yes
the
sewers
you
hide
from
them
crawl
about
in
their
filth
scavenging
like
rats
what
do
you
fear
kill
this
guy
already
one
vampire
charges
adam
and
adam
grabs
it
by
the
throat
and
holds
it
you
fear
the
cross
the
sun
fire
and
oh
yes
adams
puts
his
other
hand
on
the
vampire's
shoulder
and
he
lifts
the
vampire's
head
from
its
shoulders
the
body
falls
and
he
drops
the
head
on
it
and
they
turn
to
dust
i
believe
decapitation
is
a
problem
as
well
you
can
have
the
place
i
mean
we
don't
have
to
stay
here

forced
in
where
it
doesn't
belong
plus
she
was
um
tara
sighs
she
was
kind
of
mean
tara
laughs
sadly
so
you
think
buffy's
not

been
possessed
or
something
tara
sighs
i'm
not
sure
you
didn't
sense
a
hyena
energy
at

because
hyena
possession
is
justunpleasant
do
you
have
anything
of
hers
of

the
nether
realm
therethere's
a

the
nether
realm
exists
beyond
the
physical
world

faith
buffy
sits
on
riley's

straddling
him
got
the
consolation
prize

so
i
don't

i
was
kind
of
curious
to
meet
her
faith
buffy
holds
riley's

a
tendency
to
give
in
to
her
animal
instincts
faith
buffy
kisses
riley
and
nips
his

could
learn
something
