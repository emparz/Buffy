adam
continues
walking
disappointed
by
demonkind
we
turned
to
humans
smart
adaptive
adam
turns
around
but
emotional
and
weak
blind
there's
imperfection
everywhere
something
must
be
done
who
will
deliver
us
riley
says
nothing
mother
she
saw
our
future
yours
and
mine
she

play
by
my
side
stand
up
riley
stands
up
you
see
we
are
brothers
after
all
cut

didn't
send
for
you
spike

my
head
kind
of
guy
spike
looks
at
riley
slightly
stiffer
than
usual
spike
snaps
his
fingers
in
riley's
face
who
doesn't
move
a
muscle
subtle
but
i
like
it
spike
starts
nudging
riley
what's
with
him
i
activated
his
chip
oh
so
it's
chips
all
around
is
it
someone
must've
bought
the
partypack
you
get
yours
removed
when
the
slayer
is
where
i
want
her
she's
separated
from
her
friends
spike
walks
over
to
a
chair
they
want
nothing
to
do
with
her
spike
sits
down
she's
all
alone
adam
walks
over
to
spike
that's
how
i
want
her
where
i
want
her
is
down
in
the
initiative
adam
stops
walking
she
will
ensure
that
as
many
demons
die
as
humans
she
will
achieve
maximum
carnage
before
she's
too
weak
to
go
on
no
you
can't
stop
talking
riley
stops
adam
looks
at
spike
right
the
initiative
but
getting
her
therethat's
what
the
bleeding
disks
are
for
isn't
it
our
little
witch
gives
her
the
info
and
popalice
heads

natural
choice
a
friend

talking
to
each
other
for
a
long
long

a
small
flaw
so
you
failed
well

supposed
to
be
so
smart
spike
stands
up
you
let
me
plan
this
thing
okay

about
who
failed
who
the
important
thing
is
make
sure
the
slayer
is
where
we
want
go
gone
spike
starts
to
leave
halfway
out

oddly
anya
decided
not

despite
all
the
fun
we
had
at
our
last
meeting
and
i
don't
think
tara
felt
welcome
why
because
of
the
things
that
we
said
willow
nods
will
who
told
you
we
were
talking
behind
your
back
specifically
well
umspike
specifically
but
and
who
told
you
that
we
thought
you'd
be
better
off
joining
the
army
that's
notexactly
what
he
said
well
uhssspike
can
be
very
convincing
whenwhenwhen
uhi'm
very
stupid
he
played
us
he
wanted
us
to
fight
to
split
us
up
that's
where
it
came
from
the
stuff
we
said
the
other
night
of
course
well
piffle
let's
move
on
i'm
movin'
me
too
good
great
cut
to
willow
cut
to
xander
cut
to
giles
cut
to
a
shot
of
all
four
sowhy
do
you
think
spike
made
with
the
head
games
he's
all
dressed
up
with
no
one
to
bite
he's
gotta
get
his
yayas
somehow
i
think
it
was
more
than
that
i
think
it
was
adam
spike's
working
for
adam
after
all
we've
donenah
i
can't
even
act
surprised
giles
smiles
i
just
went
to
adam's
lair
and
he
was
gone
but
spike
just
happened
to
be
there
he
made
this
big
noise
about
getting
information
off
those
encrypted
disks
oh
i
decrypted
them
buffy
looks
at
her
surprised
well
they
decrypted
themselves
but
i
almost
had
it
what
did
they
say
a
bunch
of
stuff
we
already
know
about
314
but
it
also
said
there's
some
final
phase
where
adam
manufactures
a
bunch
of
creepy
cyberdemonoids
like
him
there's
a
special
lab
in
the
initiative
but
it
didn't
say
where
adam
fed
spike
those
disks
it
has
to
be
he
wanted
me
to
know
about
his
evilguy
assembly
line
this
lab
it's
in
the
initiative
hidden
somewhere
we'll
give
the
demon
his
due
he
thought
this
one
out
what
do
you
mean
you
know
how
overcrowded
the
containment
cells
have
been
at
the
initiative
willow
nods
those
demons
were
just
too
easy
to
catch
it's
like
they
wanted
in
that
place
giles
putting
on
his
glasses
the
trojan
horse
adam's
gonna
make
sure
the
demons
attack
the
initiative
from
the
inside
demons
versus
soldiers
massacre
massacre
and
adam
has
a
neat
pile
of
body
parts
to
start
assembling
his
army
diabolical
yet
willow
makes
a
face
gross
does
anybody
else
miss
the
mayor
i
just
wanna
be
a
big
snake
i've
got
to
shut
him
down
giles
his
final
phase
is
about
to
start
we
need
to
warn
the
initiative
they're
not
gonna
listen
to
me
riley
he's
a
deserter
he
got
some
bad
news
anyway
and
kinda
took
off
okay
i'm
confused
again
adam
has
this
evil
plan
why
is
he
so
anxious
for
you
to
know
about
it
he
wants
me
there
probably
figures
i'll
even
the
kill
ratio
he's
not
worried
you
might
kill
oh
say
him
no
he's
really
not
cut
to
the
lower
lab
she's
coming
i
can
feel
it
good
on
you
got
a
chunk
of
prognosticating
demon
in
there
right
he
walks
over
to
a
chair
now
spike
claps
his
hands
if
you'll
just
get
this
chip
out
of
my
cranium
spike
sits
down
i'll
be
out
of
your
way
and
mind
the
hairline
i
don't
fancy
fussing
over
a
combover
as
i
resume
my
killing
ways
come
on
we
had
a
deal
when
she's
here
spike
sighs
cut
to
riley
cut
to
giles'
apartment
certainly
no
lack
of
supplies
i
only
wish
i
knew
which
ones
would
kill
adam
according
to
riley
his
power
source
is
uranium
core
embedded
somewhere
inside
his
chest
probably
near
the
spine
great
so
we
just
ask
him
to
lie
down
quietly
while
we
do
some
exploratory
surgery
what
about
magic
some
kind
of
i
don't
knowuranium
extracting
spell
everyone
looks
at
her
in
disbelief
i
know
i'm
reaching
giles
stands
up
perhaps
a
paralyzing
spell
he
walks
over
to
the
bookshelf
and
pulls
a
book
off
only
i
can't
perform
the
incantation
for
this
right
don't
you
have
to
speak
it
in
sumerian
or
something
i
do
speak
sumerian
it's
not
that
only
aan
experienced
witch
can
incant
it
and
you'd
have
to
be
within
striking
distance
of
this
object
see
what
you
get
for
takin'
french
instead
of
sumerian
what
was
i
thinking
so
no
problem
all
we
need
is
to
combine
buffyher
with
slayer
strength
giles'
multilingual
know
how
and
willow's
witchy
power
giles
looks
at
him
yeah
don't
tell
me
i'm
just
full
of
helpful
suggestions
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
are
cut

stomach
and

head
howcan

you
could
never
hope
to
grasp
the
source
superimpose
adam's
room
at
the
initiative
of
our
power
buffy
uppercuts
adam
sending
him
flying
to
the
ground
she
picks
him
up
and
kicks
him
against
the
wall
she
reaches
into
him
and

the
uranium
but

is
right
here
adam
groans
and
he
falls
to
the
ground
riley
walks
up
buffy
the
uranium
begins
levitating
a
woman
begins
speaking
sumarian
and
the
uranium
disappears
buffy's
eyes
go
normal
and
she
faints
but
riley
catches
her
cut
to
the
inside
of
314
everyone
else
drops
wow
that
was
the
door
breaks
down
and
a
demon
comes
inside
spike
comes
in
and
breaks
the
demon's
neck
the
demon
falls
to
the
floor
nasty
sort
of
fellow
lucky
for
you
blighters
i
was
here
eh
yes
thank
you
cut
to
spike
although
your
heroism
has
been
slightly
muted
by
the
fact
that
you
were
helping
adam
to
start
a
war
that
would
kill
us
all
you
probably
just
saved
us
so
we
wouldn't
stake
you
right
here
did
it
work
they
all
get
up
well
then
everything's
all
right
and
we
all
get
to
be
not
staked
through
the
heart
good
work
team
buffy
and
riley
open
the
door
buffy
willow
comes
over
and
hugs
buffy
wasn't
it
amazing
you
were
great
we
were
great
we
still
got
men
out
there
well
let's
go
save
'em
by
gum
you
guys
get
to
the
exits
get
'em
open
buffy
looks
at
riley
you
organize
the
soldiers
pull
'em
back
i'll
take
point
buffy
starts
walking
out
are
you
up
to
this
i
am
buffy
knocks
out
a
demon
cut
to
an
office
it
was
an
experiment
the
initiative
represented
the
government's
interests
in
not
only
controlling
the
otherworldly
menace
but
harnessing
its
power
for
our
own
military
purposes
the
considered
opinion
of
this
counsel
is
that
this
experiment
has
failed
fades
between
different
battle
scenes
buffy
attacking
many
demons
once
the
prototype
took
control
of
the
complex
our
soldiers
suffered
a
40
percent
casualty
rate
graham
shooting
demons
only
through
the
actions
of
the
deserter
and
a
group
of
civilian
insurrectionists
that
xander
helping
willow
down
onto
the
ground
our
losses
were
not
total
i
trust
the
irony
of
that
is
not
lost
on
any
of
us
maggie
walsh's
vision
a
soldier
with
a
gun
was
brilliant
but
ultimately
unsupportable
colonel
mcnamara
getting
attacked
by
a
demon
the
demons
cannot
be
harnessed
the
fight
ends
cannot
be
controlled
fade
to
an
office
it
is
therefore
our
recommendation
that
this
project
be
terminated
and
all
records
concerning
it
expunged
our
soldiers'll
be
debriefed
standard
confidentiality
clause
we
will
monitor
the
civilians
and
usual
measures
prepared
should
they
try
to
go
public
i
don't
think
they
will
cut
to
the
screen
man
os
the
initiative
itself
will
be
filled
in
with
concrete
burn
it
down
gentlemen
burn
it
down
and
salt
the
earth
the
tv
screen
goes
to
static
cut
to
black
