at
willow
with
one
hand
and
she
falls
back
onto
the
floor
wincing
anya
softly
to
giles
how'd

still
completely
focused
on

starts
to
get
up
again
not
normally
but
with
magic
rising
up
to
her
feet
without
apparent
effort
stay
down
giles
makes
his
gesture
again
but
willow
makes
one
of
her
own
and
blocks
him
no
giles
looks
a
little
alarmed
buffy
looks
wary
moves
over
to

remember
that
little
spat
we
had
before
you
left
willow
shot
of
anya
watching
nervously
when
you
were
under
the
delusion
that
you
were
still
relevant
here
willow
walking
closer
you
called
me
a
rank
arrogant
amateur
well
buckle
up
rupert
anya
buffy
and
giles
continue
to
watch
willow
uneasily
suddenly
a
magic
light
from
nowhere
begins
to
light
up
willow's
body
and
her
eyes
go
black
again
as
a
humming
noise
begins
to
rise
in
pitch
and
volume
willow

energy
shoots
from

hand
and
forms
a
band
around
willow's
torso
pinning
her
arms
against
her
body
it
glows
with
a
green
light
that
makes

skin
appear
green

giles
continues
holding
out
his
hand
toward

suddenly
willow
throws
back
her
head
and
closes
her
eyes
apparently
unconscious
her
body
floats
up
into
the
air
and
hovers
about
a
foot
off
the
ground
the
band
of
magic
holding
her
changes
to
a
more

in
a
kind
of
stasis
for
the
time

for
the
first
time

buffy
continues
staring
at

and
hugs
him

with
their
arms
around

joins
the
hug
after
a
moment
giles
disengages
from

and
buffy
looks
at
willow
again
he
walks
over
to
willow

floating
in
the
air
unconscious
with
her
head
hanging

i'm
very
sorry
about

little
and
cranes

stands
by
the
pommel
horse
while
giles
is
picking
nervously
at
the
practice
dummy
in
a
corner
i
came
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
council
the
council

a
clue
about
much
of
anything
really
giles
walking
toward
buffy
leaning
on
the
horse
no
there's
an
an
extremely
powerful
coven
in
devon
they
sensed
the
rise
of
a
dangerous
magical
force
here
in
sunnydale
a
dark
force
fueled
by
grief
willow
i'd
so
hoped
it
wasn't
her
giles
pauses
and
then
a
seer
in
the
coven
told
me
about
tara
that's
when
the
coven
imbued
me
with
their
powers
and
sent
you
here
to
bring
willow
down
giles
looks
at
her
buffy
what's
happened
here
buffy
pacing

where
to
start
well
willow's
clearly
been
abusing
the
magicks
buffy
nods
she
has
she
was
and
i
barely
even
noticed
giles
everything's
just
been
so
buffy
sighs
xander

altar
and
anya's
a
vengeance
demon

buffy
giles
looking
shocked
dawn's
a

klepto
money's
been
so
tight
that
i've
been
slinging
burgers
at
the
doublemeat
palace

buffy
looks
down
at
the
floor
and
i've
been
sleeping
with
spike
buffy
pauses
looks
up
at
giles
looks
as
if
she
can't
believe
she
just
said
that
giles
stares
at
her
she
looks
away
again
embarrassed
suddenly
giles
starts
laughing
he
covers
his
mouth
with
his
hand
but
can't
stop
buffy
stares
at
him
pouty
giles
trying
to
calm
down
sorry
he
bursts
out
laughing
again
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
now
just
looks
amused
giles
keeps
laughing
and
slowly
buffy
starts
to
laugh
too
they
both
stand
there
laughing
cut
to
the
main
magic
box
room
anya
is
cleaning
up
some
of
the
debris
on
the
floor
she
puts
a
bunch
of
stuff
into
a
small
basket
and
carries
it
toward
the
counter
past
the
still
floating
willow
willow's
eyes
open
slightly
and
she
watches
anya
walk
across
the
room
her
voice
echoes
between
them
although
her
mouth
doesn't
move
willow
telepathically
anya
anya
turns
around
looks
at
willow
nervously
willow
willow
telepathically
i
need
you
anya
i
need
you
to
do
something
for
me
anya
twists
her
hands
together
nervously
gathers
her
nerve
and
moves
a
little
closer
to
willow
i
know
what
you're
trying
to
do
and
i
hate
to
burst
your
bubble
but
that
mind
control
mojo
doesn't
work
on
vengeance
demons
so
why
don't
you
just
willow
anya
telepathically
stop
talking
and
listen
anya
nods
okay
willow
telepathically
ou
need
to
free
me
anya
uncertain
no
anya
turns
and
starts
walking
toward
the
back
willow
telepathically
you
don't
want
to
call
out
to
them
willow
anya
stops
you
want
to
take
away
this
binding
spell
anya
turns
back
toward
willow
i
don't
know
how
willow
telepathically
i
do
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
anya
hesitates
looking
anxious
cut
back
to
the
workout
room
buffy
and
giles
are
still
laughing
helplessly
buffy
is
leaning
over
the
pommel
horse
giles
laughing
duct
tape
buffy
laughing
on
their
mouths
so
the
demon
could
eat
them
because
they
were
figments
more
laughing
all
of
it
you
sunnydale
and
i
was
just
some
nutcase
in
la
giles
still
laughing
of
course
why
didn't
we
see
it
before
slowly
they
stop
laughing
and
look
much
calmer
than
before
buffy
holds
her
stomach
giles
can
you
forgive
me
for
what
i
should
never
have
left
no
you
were
right
to
leave
we're
just
stupid
i
know
you're
all
stupid
giles
buffy
smiling
i
should
never
have
abandoned
you
no
giles
you
were
right
about
everything
it
is
time
i
was
an
adult
sometimes
the
most
adult
thing
you
can
do
is
ask
for
help
when
you
need
it
now
you
tell
me
they
smile
giles
chuckles
a
little
buffy
quietly
i
guess
i
wasn't
ready
before
it
took
a
long
time
for
that
feeling
to
go
away
the
feeling
that
i
wasn't
really
here
it
was
like
when
i
clawed
my
way
out
of
that
grave
i
left
something
behind
part
of
me
i
just
buffy
pauses
looks
giles
in
the
eye
i
don't
understand
why
i'm
back
you
have
a
calling
but
it
was
my
time
giles
someone
would
have
taken
my
place
buffy
giles
grimacing
so
why
giles
looks
away
pensive
not
answering
right
buffy
sighs
what's
gonna
happen
to
willow
giles
looks
at
her
straightens
up
well
the
coven
is
working
on
a
way
to
extract
her
powers
without
killing
her
and
uh
should
she
survive
you
ought
to
know
buffy
that
there's
no
guarantee
she'll
be
as
she
was
giles
buffy
looking
concerned
willow
has
killed
a
human
being
how
will
she
be
able
to
live
with
herself
willow
os
i
wouldn't
worry
about
that
giles
and
buffy
turn
toward
the
doorway
we
see
anya
hovering
in
the
doorway
apparently
unconscious
giles
and
buffy
stare
in
alarm
willow
moves
out
from
behind
anya
her
eyes
are
black
again
willow
doesn't
live
here
anymore
willow
lets
go
of
anya
and
she
falls
to
the
floor
zoom
in
on
buffy
looking
alarmed
blackout
act
ii

open
on
the
same
scene
willow
stands
in
the
doorway
over
anya's
unconscious
body
buffy
looks
at
giles
then
starts
forward
to
attack
willow
willow
lifts
her
hand
and
sends
a
bolt
of
magic
at
buffy
who
flies
back
crashes
against
the
wall
opposite
and
falls
to
the
ground
giles
watches
this
with
alarm
then
starts
toward
willow
himself
vincire
giles
holds
out
a
hand
toward
willow
sending
another
binding
spell
toward
her
but
she
waves
her
hand
at
it
solutum
the
binding
field
dissolves
giles
lowers
his
hand
willow
takes
a
few
steps
into
the
room
willow
small
smile
fool
me
once
on
the
wall
behind
willow
we
see
a
variety
of
knives
and
throwingweapons
hanging
in
a
case
they
suddenly
lift
off
the
wall
and
hover
in
the
air
willow
willow
shaking
a
finger
shame
on
you
the
knives
begin
to
fly
toward
giles
he
looks
to
his
left
and
yells
something
the
practice
dummy
flies
over
in
front
of
giles
and
all
the
knives
slam
into
it
willow
makes
an
angry
face
and
waves
her
hand
the
dummy
falls
aside
giles
looks
determined
makes
a
ball
of
magic
in
his
hand
and
throws
it
at
willow
excudo
willow
flies
backward
into
the
brick
wall
and
through
it
into
the
main
magic
box
room
behind
she
slams
into
a
pillar
that
supports
the
upper
loft
and
falls
to
the
floor
in
a
shower
of
bricks
debris

something
i'm
usually
good
at

yeah
'cause
i've
been
such
a
big
help
already
standing
around
like
a
monkey
while

dead
and
willow
losing
dawn
annoyed

xander

dawn
has
a
calculating
expression
you
know
if
spike
were
here
he'd
go
back
and
fight
sure
if
he
wasn't
too
busy
trying
to
rape
your
sister
dawn
stops
walking
and
stares
what
xander
pauses
then
continues
walking
shaking
his
head
forget
it
dawn
following
i
don't
believe
you
fine
dawn
uncertain
he
wouldn't
do
that
is
this
blind
spot
like
a
genetic
trait
with
the
summers
women
the
only
useful
thing
spike
ever
did
was
finally
leave
town
cut
to
the
cave
in
africa
weird
screaming
and
screeching
noises
sounds
of
punching
something
goes
flying
across
the
dark
cave
hits
the
ground
and
rolls
into
a
convenient
patch
of
light
it's
a
bald
demon
head
with
big
pointy
ears
pan
up
to
reveal
spike
who
strolls
in
holding
another
demon
head
in
one
hand
he's
barechested
and
bruised
in
many
places
well
that
was
a
bloody
doddle
and
piece
o'piss
he
staggers
and
goes
to
his
knees
wearily
but
maintains
his
sarcastic
tone
got
any
more
ruddy
tests
for
me
you
ponce
i'll
take
anything
you
can
throw
at
me
if
it'll
get
me
what
i
need
to
take
care
of
the
slayer
give
her
what's
coming
to
her
spike
sniffs
angrily
so
you
just
bring
it
on
bring
on
the
whole
he
pauses
looks
confused
weird
skittering
noises
bloody
hell
we
see
spike
from
the
waist
up
as
lots
and
lots
of
large
black
insects
maybe
beetles
start
crawling
up
his
body
they
swarm
up
his
chest
and
neck
and
onto
his
face
as
he
squeezes
his
eyes
shut
and
grunts
in
distaste
cut
to
magic
shop
main
room
the
pillar
is
lying
on
the
floor
and
furniture
sparking
occasionally
with
electricity
pan
slowly
across
the
wreckage
of
the
shop
which
has
taken
quite
a
beating
from
all
the
fighting
pan
down
to
reveal
a
large
wooden
piece
of
furniture
bookcase
lying
on
its
side
next
to
it
is
a
pile
of
books
some
of
which
are
on
fire
a
pair
of
feet
walk
up
next
to
the
books
pan
up
to
reveal
willow
still
wearing
all
black
though
her
clothes
are
now
dirty
still
with
the
veiny
face
and
the
black
hair
her
eyes
are
normal
there's
a
cut
across
her
cheek
she
smiles
that
all
you
got
jeeves
reveal
giles
standing
in
the
doorway
to
the
workout
room
he
looks
very
tired
and
bruised
his
clothes
are
dirty
also
'cause
i
could
stand
to
go
another
ten
rounds
whereas
you
can
barely
stand
giles
wearily
your
powers
may
be
undeniably
greater
but
i
can
still
hurt
you
if
i
have
to
boy
you
just
don't
get
it
do
you
nothing
can
hurt
me
now
she
lifts
a
hand
to
indicate
her
bloody
face
this
she
waves
her
hand
in
front
of
her
face
and
the
cut
heals
is
nothing
it's
all
nothing
i
see
if
you
lose
someone
you
love
the
other
people
in
your
life
who
care
about
you
buffy
appears
in
the
doorway
behind
giles
watching
become
meaningless
i
wonder
what
tara
would
say
about
that
willow
grimly
you
can
ask
her
yourself
willow
lifts
her
hand
and
sends
a
bolt
of
magic
toward
giles
buffy
rushes
forward
pushes
giles
forward
and
out
from
under
the
loft
and
just
in
time
as
the
latest
magical
blast
destroys
the
loft's
stability
and
the
whole
thing
comes
tumbling
down
buffy
and
giles
land
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
books
and
rubble
raining
down
on
them
buffy
lifts
herself
up
on
her
elbows
to
look
at
willow
you're
always
saving
everyone
it's
kinda
pesky
willow
looks
down
at
the
burning
stuff
next
to
her
she
bends
down
and
picks
up
a
ball
of
flame
in
her
hand
buffy
stares
you
probably
even
think
you're
buying
escape
time
for
jonathan
and
the
other
one
well
i
got
a
little
secret
for
ya
willow
buffy
looking
upset
i
can
kill
them
from
anywhere

away
several
dozen
feet
off

runs
after
it
cut
back
to
the
magic
shop
willow
paces
back
and
forth
you're
such
a
hypocrite

looks
up

up
to
reveal
giles
pinned
against
the
ceiling
groaning
in
pain
do
you
willow
gestures
with
one
finger
and
giles
falls
to
the
floor
he
lands
hard
on
his
stomach
and
stays
there
making
pained
faces
he
still
has
blood
all
over
his
face
willow
scornful
i
used
to
think
you
had
all
the
answers
that
i
had
so
much
to
learn
from
you
willow
she
gestures
again
giles
flies
up
to
the

slams
into
it

looking
up
at
him
you
were
jealous
still
are
just
couldn't
bear
that
i
was
the
one
with
power
that's
why
you
ran
away
incurso
green
magic
flies
from
giles's
mouth
and
hits
willow
that's
why
you
she
stumbles
backward
from
the
magic
blow
and
giles
falls
to
the
floor
again
willow
panting
that
was
rude
now

not
as
strong
as
you
think
you
are
willow
glares
at
giles
as
he
struggles
to
get
up

earth
well
now
buffy
listens
with
alarm
the
earth
wants

back
the
ground
around

and
dawn
begins
to
rumble
suddenly
the
walls
themselves
start
to
turn
into
monsters
earthcreatures
made
up
of
dirt
and
rock
and
vines
which
detach
themselves
from
the
walls
and
move
toward
buffy
and

close
on

monsters'
hands
with
a
pair
of
large
bladesclaws
on

clawhand
is
sliced

to
the
ground

turns
around

the
third
monster
in
the
head

slumps
against
the
cave
wall
buffy
stands
next
to

looking
around
more
monsters

detaching
from
the
walls

just
keep
coming

hand

turns
picks
up
the
other
sword
from
the
ground
kicks
one
of
the
monsters
back
dawn
sets
her
jaw
and
rushes
forward
into
the
fray
cut
to
the
bluff
willow
stands
with
her
arms
by
her
sides
chanting
proserpexa
let
the
cleansing
fires
from
the
depths
burn
away
the
suffering
souls
and
bring
sweet
death
lightning
crackles
between
willow
and
the
statue
of
proserpexa
close
on
willow
with
her
black
eyes
and
hair
black
veins
on
her
face
lightning
sizzling
around
her
the
ground
begins
to
shake
and
the
wind
gets
even
stronger
bolts
of
green
magic
shoot
from
willow's
body
toward
the
statue
cut
to
the
magic
shop
anya
kneels
next
to
giles
as
the
ground
shakes
here
too
a
light
fixture
falls
from
the
ceiling
and
anya
ducks
cut
to
the
cave
buffy
and
dawn
also
feel
the
rumbling
as
it
makes
them
stagger
backward
buffy
looks
up
nervous
willow
cut
to
the
magic
shop
the
rumblingshaking
stops
anya
looks
up
looks
around
nervously
then
looks
at
giles
his
eyes
are
closed
and
he
doesn't
move
giles
giles
don't
die
anya
tearfully
not
yet
therethere
are
things
i
wanna
tell
you
she
pauses
for
a
moment
as
if
collecting
her
thoughts
thanks
a
lot
for
coming
it
was
good
of
you
to
teleport
all
this
way
another
tremor
hits
and
anya
ducks
again
hiding
her
face
against
giles's
chest
until
it
subsides
though
in
retrospect
it
probably
would
have
been
better
if
you
hadn't
come
and
given
willow
all
that
magic
that
made
her
like
ten
times
more
powerful
anya
sadly
that
would
have
been
a
plus
cut
back
to
the
bluff
green
magic
continues
flowing
from
willow
toward
the
statue
wind
swirls
around
them
filled
with
dirt
and
debris
etc
also
the
everpresent
lightning
the
statue
glows
bright
yellowwhite
suddenly
the
stream
of
magic
is
interrupted
and
the
glowing
subsides
as
xander
appears
in
front
of
the
statue
willow
looks
surprised
hey
blackeyed
girl

of
here

xander
get
out
of
my
way
now
willow
sends
a
bolt
of
magic
at
xander
it
lifts
him
off
his
feet
and
throws
him
to
the
ground
at
the
base
of
the
statue
cut
to
closeup
on
giles's
face
still
bloody
still
lying
on
the
magic
shop
floor
his
eyes
pop
open
giles
whispers
there
pan
up
to
reveal
anya
looking
at
him
in
surprise
she
has
one
hand
under
his
head
what
giles
whispers
it's
not
over
giles
gives
a
small
smile
moves
his
hand
to
touch
anya's
hand
by
his
head
cut
to
the
cave
buffy
takes
a
hit
from
a
monster
dawn
is
fighting
another
swinging
her
sword
with
great
concentration
the
monster
hits
dawn's
hand
making
her
drop
the
sword
and
then
slashes
her
upper
arm
with
its
claws
dawn
grabs
her
arm
with
her
other
hand
takes
a
hit
to
the
face
and
goes
down
with
a
shriek
buffy
ducks
underneath
a
monster's
arm
and
swings
her
sword
at
another
it
goes
down
dawn
i'm
coming
dawn
looks
up
with
a
determined
expression
as
her
monster
prepares
to
attack
her
again
buffy
is
still
being
kept
away
by
another
monster
looks
toward
dawn
with
alarm
dawn
ducks
as
the
monster
grabs
for
her
and
does
a
somersaultroll
past
it
landing
by
her
sword
she
grabs
the
sword
gets
up
and
stabs
the
monster
in
the
chest
buffy
watches
with
amazement
dawn
swings
the
sword
again
slicing
off
the
monster's
head
it
falls
down
dead
buffy
stares
dawn
holding
up
the
sword
tiny
smile
what
you
think
i
never
watched
you
buffy
still
looks
amazed
there's
a
very
brief
moment
of
quiet
then
more
monsters
start
to
appear
buffy
and
dawn
back
up
and
end
up
backtoback
facing
the
monsters
each
holding
her
sword
they
begin
to
fight
cut
to
the
bluff
close
on
the
statue
lightning
continues
to
flash
around
it
wide
shot
of
willow
with
the
lightning
going
the
green
magic
begins
flowing
from
her
again
toward
the
statue
earth
rumbling
winds
swirling
etc
xander
sits
up
at
the
base
of
the
temple
holding
his
ribs
he
staggers
to
his
feet
and
blocks
the
flow
of
magic
again
the
magic
stops
flowing
willow
glares
at
him
you
can't
stop
this

well
i
was
going
to
walk
you
off
a
cliff
and
hand

an
anvil
but

seemed
kinda
cartoony
still
making
jokes

you're
in
pain

can't
imagine
the
pain
you're

yellow
crayon
and
you
were
too
afraid
to
tell
anyone
you've
come
pretty
far

the
world

terrific
notion
but
the
thing
is

willow
angry
shut
up
willow
gestures
with
her
hand
no
magic
bolts
of
light
but
xander's
head
jerks
to
the
side
as
if
he's
been
hit
three
parallel
cuts
appear
on
his
cheek
bloody
as
if
scratched
he
puts
his
hand
up
to
them
looks
at
his
fingers
willow
watches
panting
and
looking
a
bit
nervous
xander
looks
back
up
at
her
i
love
you
willow
makes
another
slashing
gesture
xander
doubles
over
and
falls
to
his
knees
panting
he
gets
up
again
and
we
see
that
his
shirt
is
ripped
open
over
the
heart
more
scratches
visible
on
his
chest
he
pants
and
grimaces
from
the
pain
but
faces
willow
again
xander
panting
i
love
y
willow
shut
up
now
she
does
throw
a
blast
of
magic
at
him
and
he
staggers
backward
but
doesn't
fall
down
willow
still
holds
her
hand
out
a
little
bit
of
magic
crackling
around
it
but
not
as
much
as
she
had
expected
she
looks
surprised
and
anxious
xander
moves
slowly
toward
her
i
love
you
willow
stop
she
sends
another
magic
blast
but
it's
weak
and
barely
hurts
xander
at
all
he
continues
walking
toward
her
willow
continues
holding
out
her
hand
and
making
the
magic
gesture
but
nothing
happens
she
starts
to
get
teary
i
love
you
stop
willow
starts
to
cry
and
as
xander
gets
right
up
to
her
she
starts
hitting
him
with
her
fists
xander
just
stands
there
and
takes
it
after
a
moment
she
stops
hitting
and
starts
to
cry
for
real
she
falls
to
her
knees
and
xander
kneels
with
her
puts
his
arms
around
her
and
holds
her
while
she
sobs
i
love
you
as
willow
continues
to
cry
in
xander's
arms
the
veins
fade
away
from
her
face
and
her
hair
returns
to
its
usual
red
