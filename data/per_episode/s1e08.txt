he
steps
over

puts

ms
calendar
i'm
sure
your
computer
science
class
is
fascinating
but
i
happen
to
believe
that
one
can
survive
in
modern
society
without
being
a
slave
to
the
um
idiot
box
that's
tv
the
idiot
box
is
tv
this
ms
calendar
indicates
a
computer
is
the
good
box
i
still
prefer
a
good
book
the
printed
page
is
obsolete
fritz
stands
up
information
isn't
bound
up
anymore
it's
an
entity
the
only
reality

you're
not
alive

strong
but
he
does
have
a
point
you

for
the
last
two
years
more
email
was
sent
than
regular
mail
oh
more
digitized
information
went
across
phone
lines
than
conversation
that
is
a
fact
that
i
regard
with
genuine
horror
i'll
bet
it
is
ms
calendar
to
the
students

few

she
continues
down
the
hall
with
a
big
smile
on
her
face
buffy
is
confused
and
stares
after
her
a
moment
then
starts
to
follow
cut
to
the
computer
lab
fritz
and
dave

there
typing
away

is
a
puzzle

good
at
these

it
involve
a
midget
and
a
block
of
ice
i
met
him
online
on
line
for
what
willow
indicates
a
computer
oh
ms
calendar
strides
quickly
into
the
room
wearing
dark
glasses
and
holding
a
mug
of
coffee
in
one
hand
and
her
books
in
the
other
morning
kids
buffy
turns
to
look
at
her
ms
calendar
notices
buffy
as
she
heads
to
her
desk
she
puts
her
mug
down
buffy
are
you
supposed
to
be
somewhere
ms
calendar
takes
off
her
glasses
no
i
have
a
free
cool
but
this
is
lab
time
so
let's
make
it
a
nice
short
visit
okay
sure
you
have
mail
it's
him
willow
types
to
get
the
message
i'm
thinking
of
you
he's
so
sweet
buffy
nods
he's
a
sweetie
buffy
smiles
nervously
what
should
i
write
back
uh
willow
i
think
it's
really
great
that
you
have
this
cool
pen
pal
but
don't
you
think
you're
kinda
rushing
all
into
this
y'know
what
i
mean
'i'm
thinking
of
you
too'
no
that's
incredibly
stupid
will
down
girl
let's
focus
here
okay
what
do
you
actually
know
about
this
guy
oh
see
i
knew
you'd
react
like
this
like
what
the
camera
closes
in
on
the
computer's
video
feed
i
just
wanna
make
sure
you're
careful
that's
all
cut
to
the
computer's
view
buffy
he
could
be
different
than
you
think
the
computer
focuses
closely
on
buffy
cut
to
an
office
the
computer
on
the
desk
suddenly
comes
on
the
student
records
scroll
by
it
stops
on
buffy's
record
and
expands
it
cut
to
fritz's
pc
in
the
lab
buffy's
record
appears
there
the
camera
pans
over
to
fritz
as
he
studies
her
record
the
screen
goes
blank
and
a
message
appears
watch
her
cut
to
willow
and
buffy
his
name
is
malcolm
black
he's
eighteen
he
lives
in
elmwood
which
is
about
eighty
miles
from
here
and
he
likes
me
short
tall
skinny
fat
why
does
everything
have
to
be
about
looks
not
everything
but
some
stuff
is
i
mean
what
if
you
guys
get
really
really
intense
and
then
you
find
out
that
he
has
a
hairy
back
well
no
uh
he
doesn't
talk
like
somebody
who
would
have
a
hairy
back
and
anyways
that
stuff
doesn't
matter
when
you
really
care
about
each
other
maybe
i'm
not
his
ideal
either
hey
i'm
just
trying
to
make
sure
that
he's
good
enough
for
you
i
think
it's
great
that
you
met
someone
cut
to
ms
calendar
at
her
desk
she
gets
up
holding
some
papers
and
comes
over
to
fritz
hey
fritz
i'm
uh
lookin'
at
the
logs
you
and
dave
are
clockin'
a
pretty
scary
amount
of
computer
time
new
project
ooo
will
i
be
excited
you'll
die
cut
outside
to
the
steps
a
boy
is
reviewing
his
report
on
his
laptop
this
isn't
my
report
'nazi
germany
was
a
model
of
a
wellordered
society'
i
didn't
write
that
who's
been
in
my
files
willow
comes
down
the
steps
next
to
him
she's
off
in
her
own
world
and
doesn't
notice
xander
coming
from
her
right
he
puts
his
hand
over
her
eyes
and
she's
forced
to
stop
nearly
losing
her
balance
hup
guess
who
uh
xander
yeah
but
keep
guessing
anyway
xander
xander
takes
his
hand
from
her
eyes
oh
i
can't
fool
ya
you
see
right
through
my
petty
charade
we
goin'
to
the
bronze
tonight
willow
smiles
not
me
i
think
i'm
gonna
call
it
an
early
night
oh
malcolm
right
xander
willow
smiles
and
nods
yeah
i
heard
but
you're
gonna
be
missin'
out
i'm
plannin'
to
be
witty
i'm
gonna
make
fun
of
all
the
people
who
won't
talk
to
me
that's
nice
have
a
good
time
willow
smiles
and
quickly
leaves
he
watches
her
go
buffy
arrives
and
watches
her
go
too
she
certainly
looks
perky
yeah
color
in
the
cheeks
bounce
in
the
step
i
don't
like
it
it's
not
healthy
xander
faces
her
so
are
you
goin'
to
the
bronze
tonight
oh
probably
not
you
probably

some
vampire
slaying
or
some
lame
endeavor
like
that
don't
you
everyone
deserts
me
they
begin
to
walk
check
out
the
jealous
man
what
are
you
talking
about
you're
jealous
of
what
willow's
got
a
thang
and
xander's
left
hanging
oh
that's
meaningless
drivel
i'm
not
interested
in
willow
like
that
yeah
but
you
got
used
to
being
the
belle
of
the
ball
no
it's
just
this
malcolm
guy
what's
his
deal
i
mean
tell
me
you're
not
slightly
wigged
okay
slightly
i
mean
just
not
knowing
what
he's
really
like
or
who
he
really
is
i
mean
sure
he
says
he's
a
high
school
student
but
i
can
say
i'm
a
high
school
student

are
okay
but
i
can
also
say
that
i'm
an
elderly
dutch
woman

to
say
i'm
not
if
i'm
in
the
elderly
dutch
chat
room
buffy
making
light
i
get
your
point
buffy
gets
his
point
i
get
your
point
oh
this
guy
could
be
anybody
he
could
be
weird
or
crazy
or
old
or
he
could
be
a
circus
freak
he's
probably
a
circus
freak
yeah
i
mean
we
read
about
it
all
the
time
y'know

meet
on
the
'net
they

get
together

staring
at
stuff

cut
to
the

the
next
day
the

two
girls
out
when
suddenly
willow
comes
barging
in
whoa
you're
the
late
girl
i
overslept
till
fifth
period
talkin'
to
malcolm
last
night
yeah
willow
sees
buffy's
look
what
nothing
you're
having
an
expression
i'm
not
but
if
i
was
it'd
be
saying
'this
just
isn't
like
you'
willow
not
like
me
to
have
a
boyfriend
he's
boyfriendly
i
don't
understand
why
you
don't
want
me
to
have
this
i
mean
boys
don't
chase
me
around
all
the
time
i
thought
you'd
be
happy
for
me
i
just
want
you
to
be
sure
to
meet
him
face
to
face
in
daylight
in
a
crowded
place
with
some
friends
y'know
before
you
become
all
obsessive
malcolm
and
i
really
care
about
each
other
big
deal
if
i
blow
off
a
couple
classes
i
thought
you
said
you
overslept
malcolm
said
you
wouldn't
understand
malcolm
was
right
cut
to
the
computer
lab
buffy
comes
in
sees
dave
and
goes
over
to
him
dave
buffy
he's
oblivious
hey
there
dave
anybody
home
he
jumps
in
his
seat
when
she
puts
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
oh
what
do
you
want
i
wanted
to
ask
you
something
if
you
have
a
minute
what
is
it
well
you're
a
computer
geek
genius
and
uh
i
sort
of
have
a
technical
problem
if
i
wanted
to
find
out
something
about
someone
i
if
someone
emailed
me
could
i
trace
the
letter
well
you
could
pull
up
somebody's
profile
based
on
their
user
name
but
they
write
the
profile
themselves
right
and
so
they
could
say
anything
they
wanted
true
wow
i
had
knowledge
buffy
dave
smiles
well
is
there
a
way
to
find
out
exactly
where
a
letter
an
eletter
came
from
i
mean
the
actual
location
of
the
computer
that's
a
challenge
'cause
you
see
willow's
got
this
boyfriend
malcolm
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
dave
interrupting
leave
willow
alone
what
do
you
mean
that's
none
of
your
business
buffy
jumps
to
a
conclusion
dave
are
you
malcolm
dave
turns
back
to
the
pc
of
course
not
dave
types
dave
what's
going
on
look
i'll
talk
to
you
later

to
do
she
gets
up

tonight

goes
over
to
xander
a
moment

of
quiet
reflection
i
do
not
suggest
that
you
illegally
enter
the
ms
calendar

the
library
data
into
the
file
so
the
book
will
be
listed
by

i
just
came
by
to
check
your
new
data
base
make
sure
your
cross
reference
table
isn't
glitching
'cause
i'm
guessing
you
haven't
gone
anywhere
near
it
uh
i'm
still
sorting
through
the
chaos
you
left
behind
you
hmm
ms
calendar
to

buffy
grabs

and
turns
to

at
another
time
i
think

they
leave
buffy
to
xander
makes
our
speaking
english
is
good
i
panicked
okay
cut
to
the
computer
lab
willow
is
chatting
online
with
malcolm
i've
never
felt
this
way
about
anyone
before
willow
i
know
what
you
mean
i
feel
like
you
know
me
better
than
anyone
i
do
do
you
think
we
should
meet
i
think
we
should
soon
i'm
nervous
i'm
not
isn't
that
strange
that's
what
buffy
doesn't
understand
how
comfortable
you
can
make
me
feel
buffy
just
makes
trouble
that's
why
she
got
kicked
out
of
her
old
school
she
is
puzzled
and
pauses
for
a
moment
how
did
you
know
that
it's
on
her
permanent
record
she
doesn't
respond
still
puzzled
you
must
have
mentioned
it
i
guess
let's
not
worry
about
her
anymore
i
have
to
sign
off
i'll
talk
to
you
later
don't
bye
she
turns
off
the
monitor
gets
up
and
leaves
cut
to
the
library
ms
calendar
exasperated
you're
a
snob
giles
incredulous
i
am
no
such
thing
oh
you
are
a
big
snob
you
you
think
that
knowledge
should
be
kept
in
these
carefully
guarded
repositories
where
only
a
handful
of
white
guys
can
get
at
it
nonsense
i
simply
don't
adhere
to
a
a
kneejerk
assumption
that
because
something
is
new
it's
better
this
isn't
a
fad
rupert
we
are
creating
a
new
society
here
a
society
in
which
human
interaction
is
all
but
obsolete
in
which
people
can
be
completely
manipulated
by
technology
well
well
thank
you
i'll
pass
well
ms
calendar
ahem
i
think
you'll
be
very
happy
here
with
your
musty
old
books
ms
calendar
opens
moloch's
book
these
musty
old
books
have
a
great
deal
more
to
say
than
in
any
of
your
fabulous
web
pages
hmm
ms
calendar
pages
through
the
book
this
one
doesn't
have
a
whole
lot
more
to
say
giles
stares
at
the
empty
book
what
is
it
like
a
diary
how
odd
i
haven't
looked
through
all
the
volumes
yet
i
didn't
um
he
closes
the
book
and
sees
the
etching
of
moloch
on
the
cover
what
is
it
uh
nothing
um
a
a
diary
yes

imagine

what
it
is
giles
pauses
to
think

heads
to

the
camera
cuts
to
a
light
above
and
follows
an
electrical
cord
from
it
down
to
the
corner
of
the
floor
in
the
shower
buffy
walks
into
the
shower
to
turn
off
the
water
this
is
how
droughts

started
she
turns
the
water
off
the
water
creeps
toward
the
exposed
wires
buffy
get
out
she
turns
to
him
and
notices
the
wires
they
begin
to
spark
she
leaps
out
of
the
shower
an
arc
of
electricity
follows
her
for
an
instant
she
lands
on
a
changing
bench
and
rolls
off
onto
the
floor
dave
runs
from
the
locker
room
she
sits
up
and
looks
over
toward
the
showers
the
camera
pulls
back
to
show
the
soles
of
her
shoes
smoking
cut
to
the
computer
lab
it's
dark
dave
comes
in
and
turns
on
a
pc
i
can't
do
it
i'm
not
gonna
do
it
but
you
promised
buffy
isn't
a
threat
to
you
stop
with
it
the
project
is
almost
complete
you
won't
have
to
do
it
again
dave
drops
his
bag
and
whimpers
oh

i've
shown

a
new
world
dave
knowledge
power
i
can
give
you
everything
all
i
want
is
your
love
no
this
isn't
right
none
of
it
is
the
scratch
pad
comes
up
on
the
screen
and
moloch
writes
a
note
i'm
sorry
i've
been
a
terrible
person
i'm
a
coward
and
i
can't
go
on
living
like
this
forgive
me
mom
and
dad
at
least
now
i'll
have
some
peace
remember

love
dave
he
backs
away
from
the
computer
fritz
is
waiting
behind
him
by
the
window
cut
to
the
library
buffy
sits
at
the
table
while
xander
paces
i'm
gonna
kill
dave
he
tried
to
warn
me
warn
you
that
he
set
you
up
xander
to
giles
is
she
gonna
be
okay
she
was
only
grounded
for
a
moment
giles
sits
and
hands
buffy
a
mug
still
if
you'd
been
anyone
but
the
slayer
tell
me
the
truth
how's
my
hair
it's
great
it's
your
best
hair
ever
xander
smiles
uh
oh
yes
i
just
i
don't
understand
what
would
make
dave
do
a
thing
like
that
i
think
perhaps
i
do
he
goes
over
to
get
moloch's
book
from
the
cage
he
comes
back
holding
it
up
does
this
look
familiar
to
either
of
you
yeah
sure
looks
like
a
book
i
knew
that
one
giles
sets
it
on
the
table
in
the
dark
ages
the
souls
of
demons
were
sometimes
trapped
in
certain
volumes
they
remained
locked
within
the
book
harmless
unless
the
pages
were
read
aloud
unless
i'm
mistaken
this
is
moloch
the
corrupter
a
very
deadly
and
seductive
demon
he
draws
people
to
him
with
promises
of
love
power
knowledge
preys
on
impressionable
minds
like
dave's
dave
and
who
knows
how
many
others
and
moloch
is
inside
that
book
not
anymore
giles
opens
the
book
you
released
moloch
way
to
go
i
didn't
read
it
that
dreadful
calendar
woman
found
it
and
and
it
was
already
blank
okay
so
a
powerful
demon
with
horns
is
walking
around
sunnydale
and
nobody's
noticed
iif
he's
so
big
and
strong
why
bother
with
dave
i
mean
why
didn't
he
just
attack
buffy
himself
i
don't
know
and
i
don't
know
who
could've
read
that
book
it
wasn't
even
in
english
where
was
it
uh
in
a
pile
with
others
that
were
um
uh
scanned
they
look
over
at
the
pc
and
that
released
the
demon
no
he's
not
out
here
buffy
points
to
the
pc
he's
in
there
the
scanner
read
the
book
it
brought
moloch
out
as
information
to
be
absorbed
he's
gone
binary
on
us
okay
for
those
of
us
in
our
studio
audience
who
are
me
you
guys
are
saying
that
moloch
is
in
this
computer
and
every
computer
connected
to
it
by
a
modem
he's
everywhere
what
are
we
gonna
do
willow
scanned
him
into
her
file
it
may
be
a
futile
gesture
but
i
suggest
we
um
uh
delete
it
solid
she
gets
up
and
walks
over
to
the
pc
don't
get
too
close
she
sits
down
in
front
of
it
okay
okay
buffy
turns
on
the
monitor
so
which
file
do
you
think
it
is
willow
buffy
types
that's
probably
it
right
i'll
just
delete
the
whole
thing
she
drags
the
file
icon
to
the
trash
bin
and
inhales
in
fright
when
moloch's
demonic
face
appears
on
the
screen
stay
away
from
willow
it
is
none
of
your
business
the
screen
returns
to
normal
so
that's
what
malcolm
looks
like
part
3

the
library
so
much
for
delete
file
this
is
very
bad
are
we
overreacting
he's
in
a
computer
what
can
he
do
you
mean
besides
convince
a
perfectly
nice
kid
to
try
and
kill
me
i
don't
know
how
about
mess
up
all
the
medical
equipment
in
the
world
randomize
traffic
signals
access
launch
codes
for
our
nuclear
missiles
destroy
the
world's
economy
i
think
i
pretty
much
capped
it
with
that
nuclear
missile
thing
right
yours
was
best
okay
he's
a
threat
i'm
on
board
with
that
now
but
what
can
we
do
about
it
i
think
the
first
thing
we
do
is
find
willow
she's
probably
talking
to
him
right
now
god
that
creeps
me
out
what
does
he
want
with
willow
let's
never
find
out
buffy
gets
up
okay
i'm
gonna
check
the
computer
lab
and
you
guys
call
her
home
cut
to
the
computer
lab
buffy
comes
in
and
looks
around
it's
dark
willow
the
pc's
suddenly
all
come
on
startling
her
she
backs
further
into
the
room
while
looking
around

turns
around

jumps
as
she
bumps

teach
computer
science
at
the
local
high
school
a
profession
that
hardly
lends
itself
to
the
casting
of
bones
wrong
and
wrong
snobby
you
think
the
realm
of
the
mystical
is
limited
to
ancient
texts
and
relics
that
bad
old
science
made
the
magic
go
away

divine
exists
in

no
context
it's
it's
there
and
then
it's
gone
