comes
down

and
dark
sunglasses
he
strides
toward
the
bar
whiskey
straight
up
and
get
a
round
for
the
house
i'm
feeling
expansive
we

that
the

looks
unimpressed
by
warren
warren
sits
down
removes
his
shades
a
vampire
is
on
the
stool
next
to
him
staring
at

friendly
greeting

and
holds
him
off
i'm
watching
my
program
warren
shrugs
and
straightens
up
as
the
vamp
lets
him
go

your
'me'
time
warren
loudly
not
even
to
buy
the
guy
who
killed
the
slayer

look
with
the
demon
bartender
no
warren
pauses
briefly
surprised
but
then
recovers
not
important
i
cut
them
loose

that
buffy's
out
of
the
picture
some
things
have
got
to
change
around
here
warren
to
bartender
i
need
a
real
gang

of
wannabes

you
killed
the

mention
that
you
know
i've
explored
all
the
dark
arts

i
tried
it
against
the
slayer
but
you
know
what
i
found
really
works
the
vampire
and
bartender
lean
in
close
to
hear
gun
vampire
small
grin
you
killed
the
slayer
with
a
gun
in
her
own
backyard
don't
underestimate
science
my
friend
good
oldfashioned
metal
meets
propulsion
the
demon
and
vampire
start
to
laugh
warren
laughs
along
with
them
bartender
to
vampire
man
this
is
gonna
be
good
warren
not
getting
it
oh

best
this
town

maybe
vampire
everyone
stops
laughing

laugh
again

doesn't
realize
that
the
others
are
laughing
at
him

him
shot
of
the
other
demons
and
vamps
at
other
tables

laughing
menacingly
metal
meets
propulsion
yeah

you
still
better
be
a
good
shot
more
laughter
but
warren
is
finally
cluing
in
this
isn't
the
evil
laugh
of

it
more
like

evil
laugh
of
you're
a
dead
man
vampire
more
laughter
warren
totally
rattled

alarmed

continue
laughing
slayers
heal
fast
real
fast
yeah
i
was
gonna
eat
you
myself
during

be
more
fun
to
let
the
slayer
degut
you
warren
now
looks
pretty
scared
might
want
to
get
a
head

it
i
warren
seems
a
little
unnerved
by
the
way

walking
closer

got
the
slayer
after

say

worried
about
the
witch

the
new
power

going
to
blow
this
town
apart

rack
painfully
i
feel
death
but
the
slayer's
alive
and
and
she
heals
she
might
but
somebody's
stone
cold
and
that
is
why
the
witch
wants
your
head
she
can
sense
your
essence
right
now
man
it's
just
a
matter
of
time
before
she
finds
you
warren
panicks
lunges
forward
and
pushes
the
whole
wad
of
money
into
rack's
hand

right

that
and
i
can
get
more

looks
at
the
money
casually
hide
or
fight
both

of
it

i
still
have
a

cut
to
sunnydale
hospital
xander
stands
in
the
hallway
looking
through
a
window
into
another
room
anxious
a
nurse
in
full
scrubs
goes
past
him
holding
a
small
tray
the
camera
follows
her
as
she
goes
around
a
corner
and
through
a
door
into
the
room
xander
is
watching
we
see
various
medical
personnel
working
on
buffy
talking
indistinctly
a
machine
beeps
steadily
standing
by
a
doctor
is
working
on
the
wound
in
buffy's
chest
we've
got
to
stop
that
bleeding
where
over
by

close
on

as

doctor
and
nurse

work
on
her
we
got
more
bleeding
bp
is
suddenly
all
the
lights
flicker
and
the
machines
blink
off
and
on
again
the
steady
beeping
begins
to
speed
up
the
doctor
and
nurses
look
up
in
confusion
what's
happening
angle
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
as
willow
comes
into
view
we
see
xander
through
the
window
in
background
leave
xander
sees
her
hurries
toward
the
side
and
out
of
view
the
doctor
and
nurses
turn
to
look
at
willow
she
is
now
wearing
all
black
her
hair
and
eyes
still
black
too
the
lights
in
the
room
continue
flashing
erratically
and
the
beeping
continues
to
speed
up
xander
rushes
in
looks
with
surprise
at
willow
with
her
newly
black
hair
and
eyes
willow
willow
ignoring
him
speaking
to
the
medical
staff
now
the
doctor
and
three
nurses
move
toward
the
door
the
beeping
gets
even
faster
and
becomes
a
steady
whine
will
what
are
you
doing
she's
going
to
die
no
she
isn't
willow
moves
over
to
buffy
stands
beside
her
and
stares
down
at
her
the
beepwhine
continues
xander
stares
close
on
buffy
suddenly
the
bullet
lifts
up
out
of
her
chest
and
floats
up
into
the
air
hovering
at
willow's
eyelevel
willow
looks
at
it
the
beeping
stops
it's
so
small
she
puts
out
her
hand
and
plucks
the
bullet
out
of
the
air
brings
her
hand
back
toward
her
when
she
opens
her
hand
the
bullet
is
gone
xander
takes
a
few
steps
closer
staring
in
awe
buffy
slowly
comes
to
opens
her
eyes
and
lifts
her
head
the
lights
come
back
on
what
happened
buffy
xander
rushes
over
to
her
as
she
sits
up
oh
my
god
are
you
okay
buffy
confused
sure
how'd
i
get
here
xander
hugs
her
in
relief
willow
just
watches
you've
got
to
stop
doing
this
this
dying
thing's
funny
once
maybe
twice
buffy
looks
over
at
willow
willow
willow
very
small
smile
buffy
hey
what's
wrong
i'll
explain
but
we've
gotta
go
she
starts
to
move
toward
the
door
xander
and
buffy
watch
her
confused
why
willow
not
turning
back
it's
time
to
find
warren
willow
walks
to
the
door
and
exits
the
room
buffy
and
xander
exchange
a
look
cut
to
a
ticket
counter
somewhere
indistinct
announcements
over
a
loudspeaker
a
woman
in
a
uniform
hands
warren
a
ticket
folder
this'll
get
me
all
the
way
to
the
border
you'll
have
to
change
to
the
city
bus
it's
all
in
the
folder
she
turns
back
to
her
work
then
gives
warren
a
look
as
if
wondering
why
he's
still
there
warren
suddenly
turns
quickly
away
walks
outside
cut
to
the
street
as
warren
exits
a
bunch
of
buses
are
lined
up
along
the
curb
warren
looks
around
sees
his
bus
climbs
on
cut
to
a
highway
daylight
it's
fairly
deserted
with
mostly
desert
on
each
side
a
single
car
speeds
along
cut
to
the
interior
of
the
car
xander
is
driving
buffy
in
the
passenger
seat
and
willow
in
back
willow's
eyes
are
back
to
normal
but
her
hair
is
still
black
faster
i'm
going
as
fast
as
i
willow
faster
close
on
the
gas
pedal
as
it
slams
down
under
xander's
foot
the
car
speeds
up
will
would
you
cut
that
out
if
you
wanted
to
drive
we
need
to
stop
i
don't
like
this
we're
close
i
can
feel
him
and
we'll
catch
him
and
he'll
go
to
jail
look
i'm
finding
the
whole
getting
shot
very
motivating
but
you're
using
magic
if
i
wasn't
you'd
be
dead
willow
xander
looking
upset
maybe
but
this
isn't
right
okay
this
isn't
how
i
want
it
sometimes
you
don't
have
a
choice
i
think
buffy
gets
the
tiebreaker
on
this
one
she
was
the
one
on
the
ouchy
end
of
the
bullet
will
you
do
have
a
choice
this
isn't
good
for
you
you
made
the
decision
to
stop
for
a
reason
you
promised
us
and
can
i
just
ask
what's
with
the
makeover
of
the
damned
i
mean
the
hair
willow
isn't
really
listening
she's
looking
around
now
she
suddenly
sits
up
turn
right
go
xander
looks
in
front
of
him
seeing
nothing
go
where
over
there
now
xander
looking
in
confusion
will
turn
the
wheel
turns
itself
under
xander's
hands
the
car
screeches
off
the
road
onto
dirt
zooming
between
scraggly
bushes
and
such
xander
holding
up
his
hands
fine
fine
puppetmaster
wants
to
drive
go
right
ahead
the
car
continues
to
bounce
along
on
the
uneven
surface
finally
it
comes
to
a
stop
right
before
another
stretch
of
paved
highway
willow
jumps
out
of
the
car
and
begins
to
stride
across
the
highway
buffy
and
xander
follow
more
slowly
confused
willow
wait
stay
back
willow
gestures
at
them
and
more
bolts
of
purpleblack
energy
shoot
over
to
them
immobilizing
them
like
anya
earlier
willow
keeps
walking
now
we
see
the
bus
coming
over
a
rise
toward
her
she
stops
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
glares
at
the
bus
close
on
the
bus
driver
as
the
steering
wheel
suddenly
starts
doing
its
own
thing
he
struggles
to
control
it
but
can't
the
bus
speeds
toward
willow
who
stands
there
calmly
close
on
the
bus
driver's
foot
as
the
brake
pedal
pushes
down
underneath
his
foot
he
continues
wrestling
with
the
wheel
the
bus
starts
to
slow
down
all
the
passengers
including
warren
are
thrown
around
in
their
seats
screeching
of
tires
the
bus
slams
to
a
stop
just
a
foot
or
so
in
front
of
willow
willow
walks
around
to
the
side
the
bus
door
opens
on
its
own
get
out
all
the
bus
passengers
are
craning
their
necks
trying
to
see
what's
going
on
warren
gets
up
walks
down
the
aisle
and
down
the
steps
out
of
the
bus
willow
grabs
him
by
the
neck
lifts
him
off
the
ground
her
eyes
are
black
again
please
i'lli'll
do
anything
horrible
cracking
noise
as
willow
starts
to
squeeze
his
neck
suddenly
one
of
his
eyes
pops
out
revealing
metal
and
wiring
and
sparks
willow
lets
go
and
warren
falls
over
motionless
on
the
ground
buffy
and
xander
come
running
over
they
stop
and
stare
shot
of
the
eyeball
rolling
around
on
the
ground
willow
surprised
it's
a
robot
they
look
at
her
willow
confused
i
i
could
feel
his
essence
buffy
looks
sympathetic
but
then
willow
turns
angry
again
he
tricked
me
willow
starts
to
walk
we'll
find
him
another
way
buffy
turning
to
follow
and
then
what
and
then
we'll

him
buffy
grabs

at
her
coldly

she
turns
away
again
this
time
gesturing
behind
her
another
bolt
of
purple
magic
flies
backward
knocking
buffy
and
xander
off
their
feet
they
fall
to
the
ground
in
a
heap
willow
continues
walking
buffy
and
xander
sit
up
brushing
themselves
off
they
look
up
toward
the
car
willow

gone
just

at

the

the
hospital
to
find
you
buffy
rejoins
him

there
hours

out
of
the
various
doors

at
the
open

an
expression
of
dread

speckled
with
moonlight
and
shadows
buffy
whispers
oh

os
softly
i
didn't
want
to
leave
her
alone
buffy
turns
and
finds
dawn
huddled
in
a
little
ball
in
a
corner
formed
by
the
wall
and
a
sidetable
crying
dawn
sweetheart
buffy
kneeling
beside
dawn
come

long
shot
on
the
tableau
of
xander
standing
in
the
doorway
buffy
and
dawn
holding
each
other
and
tara
lying
dead
on
the
floor
cut
to
a
little
later
two
men
carry
a
gurney
down
the
stairs
bearing
tara's
body
covered
with
a
black
sheet
xander
stands
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
watching
he
has
changed
out
of
his
bloody
clothes
buffy
and
dawn
sit
in
the
living
room
buffy
has
also
changed
her
clothing
xander
watches
in
a
daze
as
the
men
wheel
the
gurney
out
the
front
door
one
of
them
gives
him
a
clipboard
if
you
could
just
sign
this
sure
he
signs
the
clipboard
and
hands
it
back
call
this
number
tomorrow
we'll
have
more
information
coroner
giving
xander
a
piece
of
paper
okay
thanks
thank
you
i'm
sorry
for
your
loss
the
coroner
picks
up
a
briefcase
in
one
hand
takes
the
end
of
the
gurney
in
the
other
and
he
and
the
other
unseen
coroner
exit
xander
closes
the
door
looking
at
the
piece
of
paper
goes
into
the
living
room
so
that's
it
are
the
police
gone
too
coming
back
tomorrow
with
more
of
their
pretty
yellow
tape
he
sits
on
the
coffee
table
both
he
and
buffy
put
their
faces
in
their
hands
for
a
moment
buffy
sighing
we
need
to
find
willow
yeah
she's
off
the
wagon
bigtime
warren's
a
dead
man
if
she
finds
him
dawn
bitterly
good
dawn
don't
say
that
why
not
dawn
the
others
looking
at
her
i'd
do
it
myself
if
i
could
because
you
don't
really
feel
that
way
yes
i
do
and
you
should
too
he
killed
tara
and
he
nearly
killed
you
he
needs
to
pay
out
of
the
mouths
of
babes
xander
i'm
just
saying
he's
he's
just
as
bad
as
any
vampire
you've
sent
to
dustville
being
a
slayer
doesn't
give
me
a
license
to
kill
warren's
human
dawn
scoffs
so
so
the
human
world
has
its
own
rules
for
dealing
with
people
like
him
yeah
we
all
know
how
well
those
rules
work
sometimes
they
do
sometimes
they
don't
we
can't
control
the
universe
if
we
were
supposed
to
then
the
magic
wouldn't
change
willow
the
way
it
does
and
we'd
be
able
to
bring
tara
back
dawn
very
quietly
and
mom
there
are
limits
to
what
we
can
do
there
should
be
willow
doesn't
want
to
believe
that
and
now
she's
messing
with
forces
that
want
to
hurt
her
all
of
us
i
just
i've
had
blood
on
my
hands
all
day
xander
looks
buffy
in
the
eye
blood
from
people
i
love
i
know
and
now
it
has
to
stop
warren's
going
to
get
what
he
deserves
i
promise
but
i
will
not
let
willow
destroy
herself
beat
xander
nods
sighs
okay
where
do
we
go
she
could
be
anywhere
buffy
sighs
i
don't
know
um
maybe
the
magic
box
for
some
kind
of
locating
spell
buffy
quickly
to
xander
i
could
go
myself
no
no
i'm
cool
i'll
go
dawn
can't
stay
here
by
herself
let
me
go
with
you
i
want
to
no
honey
it's
too
dangerous
but
it's
willow
she
needs
us
she
does
and
you'll
help
her
lots
okay
but
first
we
have
to
get
her
home
in
one
piece
but
buffy
dawn
i'm
serious
you've
been
through
enough
for
more
than
one
ever
you
should
be
someplace
where
you
feel
safe
dawn
sullen
fine
i
want
to
go
to
spike's
beat
buffy
sighs
heavily
all
right
what
not
all
right
are
you
kidding
after
what
spike
did
buffy
xander
buffy
gives
xander
a
meaningful
look
and
a
very
small
shake
of
the
head
i'll
get
the
coats
she
gets
up
and
moves
toward
the
foyer
xander
follows
xander
quietly
you're
not
gonna
really
leave
dawn
with
mr
attempted
rape
buffy
quietly
he
won't
hurt
dawn
i
hehe
physically
can't
besides
he
wouldn't
well
after
the
other
night
i'd
say
all
bets
are
off
on
what
he's
capable
of
dawn
feels
safe
with
him
we
don't
have
a
choice
right
now
he's
all
we've
got
xander
looks
displeased
cut
to
exterior
of
a
uc
sunnydale
dorm
building
cut
to
tara's
room
willow
sits
on
the
bed
holding
her
white
shirt
stained
with
tara's
blood
she
looks
at
it
for
a
moment
then
gets
up
kneels
on
the
floor
and
spreads
the
shirt
out
on
the
floor
bloody
side
down
we
see
that
willow's
eyes
are
still
black
blood
of
the
slain
hear
me
guide
me
to
tara's
killer
close
on
the
shirt
the
blood
rises
to
the
surface
and
forms
a
map
a
glowing
dot
as
if
the
shirt
were
on
fire
just
in
one
little
spot
marks
a
single
point
on
the
map
moving
slightly
willow
studies
it
grimly

and
bushes
out
of

blackout
act
iv

open
on
the

scene
warren
stands
over
willow
still
nervous
but
starting
to
smile
a
little
suddenly
willow
rises
upward
and
onto
her
feet
lifted
by
magic
she
turns
to
face
warren
reaching
her
arm
behind
her
to
pull
the
axe
out
of
her
back
warren
stares
at
her
fearfully
axe
not
gonna
cut

she
tosses
the
axe
to
the
ground
warren
runs
off
willow
follows
warren
runs
through
the
forest
panting
reaching
behind
him
to
pull
something
out
of
his
backpack
it's
a
small
metal
box
warren
stops
running
and
pulls
a
pin
on
the
side
of
the
box
little
metal
wings
appear
from
holes
on
two
sides
of
the
box
the
wings
begin
to
flap
warren
smiles
as
the
box
lifts
off
his
hand
and
up
into
the
air
it
zooms
away
with
quick
flitting
movements
like
a
bat
cut
to
willow
walking
calmly
through
the
woods
the
winged
box
flies
up
to
her
she
looks
at
it
in
surprise
suddenly
the
box
explodes
but
the
explosion
instead
of
moving
continuously
outward
only
expands
to
a
diameter
of
about
ten
feet
it
surrounds
willow
in
a
shimmering
ball
of
energy
like
solidified
air
and
fire
holding
her
motionless
but
then
she
steps
forward
and
the
ball
shatters
into
large
pieces
like
glass
willow
resumes
walking
cut
to
warren
running
desperately
through
the
woods
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
he
turns
to
face
front
again
and
finds
willow
directly
in
front
of
him
warren
stops
short
gasping
warren
nervous
laugh
cute

a
cute
trick

instead
of
killing
my
best
friend

killed
my
girlfriend
it

personal
that's
all
close
on
warren's
hand
in
his
pants
pocket
grasping
for
something
he
continues
moving
backward
as
willow
continues
advancing
on
him
well
this
is
warren
turns
to
run
away
willow
holds
out
both
her
hands
and
sends
a
huge
blast
of
magical
energy
at
warren
knocking
him
down
he
quickly
pulls
his
arms
out
of
his
backpack
straps
capture
he
throws
something
at
willow
looks
like
a
small
ball
of
blue
goo
it
hits
her
in
the
stomach
and
begins
to
expand
first
around
her
body
pinning
her
arms
to
her
sides
then
up
and
down
until
her
whole
body
and
head
are
surrounded
by
shimmery
transparent
blue
her
mouth
opens
as
if
trying
to
speak
but
she
can't
warren
jumps
up
and
runs
off
again
leaving
his
backpack
behind
close
on
willow's
eyes
behind
the
goo
they
begin
to
glow
fiery
orange
the
goo
in
front
of
her
eyes
melts
and
then
the
entire
cocoon
melts
and
slides
down
off

up
at
her
it's
not
like

bullet
slowly
starts
to
push
its
way
into

chest

is
clearly
in

blow
your
central
nervous
system
oh

willow
warren
angrily

willow
lifts
a
hand
and
suddenly
warren's
lips
are
sewn
shut
with
large
stitches
of
thread
he
can
only
groan
and
whimper
the
pain
will
be
unbearable
but
you
won't
be
able
to
move
bullet
usually
travels
faster
than
this
of
course
but
the
dying
it'll
seem
like
it
takes
forever
she
pauses
as
if
affected
by
her
own
words
looking
at
the
little
wound
on
warren's
chest

just
grunts
and
squeezes
his
eyes

caught
you'll
lose
them
too
your
friends
warren
panting
you
don't
want
that
i
know
you're
in
pain
but
willow
bored
now
willow
makes
a
casual
gesture
with
one
hand
a
bolt
of
magic
rips
through
warren
and
tears
the
skin
off
his
body
in
a
single
piece
anya
buffy
and
xander
arrive
just
in
time
to
see
this
oh
my
god
warren's
skinless
body
sags
against
the
vines
that
still
hold
him
very
icky
willow
stands
looking
at
it
buffy
shocked
what
did
you
do
willow
continues
looking
at
the
lifeless
body
willow
what
did
you
do
willow
looks
over
at
her
friends
then
back
at
the
body
suddenly
it
bursts
into
flame
and
burns
to
nothing
in
an
instant
willow
calmly
one
down
smoke
begins
to
curl
up
around
willow's
body
as
red
fire
flashes
in
her
eyes
again
lightning
flashes
as
her
whole
body
dissipates
into
smoke
and
is
gone
the
others
stand
there
staring
in
horror
blackout
joss
whedon
and
marti
noxon
