is
covered
with
a
bandage
willow
is
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
holding
his
hand
buffy's
standing
talking
to
him
and
that
you
should
expect
to
see
some
bruising
when
you
remove
the
bandages
bruising
around
the—
area
the
uh
bone
structure
and
musculature
was
hit
pretty
hard
ok
buffy
um
also
they
said
that
the—the
meds
may
cause
you
some
stomach
discomfort
so
we're
gonna
have
to
be
careful
with
your
diet
i
can't
taste
anything
right
now
anyway
i
keep
waiting
for
my
other
senses
to
improve
50
yeah
they
should
kick
in
any
day
now
buffy
smiling
well
we're
looking
at
a
possible
release
as
early
as
tonight
um
we're
just
waiting
for
your
labs
to
get
back
and
dr
kallet
said
that
should
be
a
couple
of
hours
that's
great
buffy
nods
ok
um
i
think
we're
all
caught
up
then
buffy
holding
the
files
to
willow
thank
you
for
this
this
was
um
really
great
work
willow
disappointed
oh
i
thought
we
were
gonna
willow
looks
at
xander
then
at
buffy
there
were
gonna
be
card
games
oh
no
i
just—
i
should
really
get
back
buffy
willow
looks
heartbroken
i
want
to
get
everyone
started
on
this
i
think
we're
really
close
to
something
it's
ok
it's
gotta
be
done
and
i
might
see
you
tonight
without
depth
perception
of
course
but
still
xander
smiles
willow
holding
xander's
hand
so
i
guess
you're
stuck
with
me
then
huh
willow
tries
to
sound
chipper
let's
order
some
cherryflavored
offbrand
gelatin
and
then
i
think
we'll
be
up
for
a
rousing
game
of—
i
might
need
a
parrot
huh
well
to
go
with
the
eye
patch
to
really
complete
the
look
i
think
i
still
have
that
costume
from
halloween
yeah
and
don't
underestimate
the
impact
of
a
peg
leg
maybe
the
hospital
can
hook
you
up
with
a
nice
one
maybe
they
have
a
2bodyparts
for
the
price
of
one
kind
of
deal
oh
you
know
what
the
best
part
is
no
one
will
ever
make
me
watch
jaws
3d
again
yeah
and
willow
tries
to
smile
you'll
never
have
to
willow
tries
to
stifle
her
tears
as
they
well
up
in
her
eyes
squeezes
xander's
hand
tighter
xander
sighs
looks
at
willow
as
tears
well
up
in
her
eyes
oh
willow

don't
willow
looks
down

we
also
know
that
the
ubervamps
are
hard
to
kill
andrew
writing
in

but
i
have
been
out
talking
to
some
of
my
old
contacts
and
they've
provided
some
surprising
bits
of
news
yay
for
them
anya
andrew
draws
a
picture
of
an
ubervamp
uhok
for
example
ubervamps
can
be
staked
right
through
the
heart
zing—poof
anya
andrew
writes
steak
then
crosses
it
out
and
writes
stake
beside
it
just
like
regular
vamps
umwe
didn't
know
this
anya
andrew
draws
a
red
arrow
from
the
word
stake
to
the
torso
of
his
ubervamp
drawing
of
course
these
guys
have
incredibly
strong
sternums
so
it's
a
lot
like
driving
a
wooden
stake
through
solid
steel
but
you
guys
are
all
superstrong
right
kennedy
scoffs
umno
right
ok
um
but
still
heart
information
still
good
to
know
since
holy
water
seems
to
run
off
these
guys
like
they've
been
scotchguarded
and
well
sunlight
would
work
but
guess
what—
they're
not
coming
out
during
the
daytime
anya
andrew
flips
to
a
clean
sheet
of
paper
and
draws
a
yellow
smiling
sun
uh
also
beware
of
their
uh
teeth
and
the
claws
they
use
to
shred
flesh
anya
anya
holds
up
her
hand
fingers
spread
like
she's
clawing
and
shredding
with
her
hand
andrew
writes
teeth
claws
ok
you
know
what
i
used
to
be
really
afraid
of
these
ubervamp
guys
but
then
the
scary
preacher
blew
into
town
and
now
i'm
mostly
terrified
of
him
anya
flips
her
note
cards
right
well
um
we're
working
on
getting
info
on
that
guy
why
bother
nothing
works
nothing
will
anya
shuffling
her
note
cards
ok
i
know
you're
all
upset
and
i
myself
would
much
rather
be
sitting
at
the
bedside
of
my
oneeyed
exfiance
than
killing
time
here
with
you
people
in
this
overcrowded
and
might
i
add
increasingly
ripesmelling
basement
and
i
would
be
too
if
not
for
a
certain
awkward
discussion
he
and
i
recently
had
right
over
there
on
that
cot
immediately
following
some
exciting
and
unexpected
breakup

anya
some
of
the
girls
seem
grossed
out
and
move
off
the
cot
andrew
writes
breakup
sex
on
the
paper
underlining
it
buti
need
to
give
him
some
space
so
i'm
doing
what
i
can
do
contributing
any
way
i
can
and
so
will
all
of
you
you

whatcha
got

we
figured
with

you
know
overt
religiosity
thing
if
we
wanna
learn
more
about
him
let's
find
out
where
he's
been
faith
reading
from
the
file
incidents
of
violence
and
vandalism
connected
to
california
religious
institutions
in
the
last
10
years
looks
like
this
gives
us
a
place
to
start
yeah
i
figure
we
start
with
california
we
don't
find
anything
there
we'll
expand
the
search
but
a
guy
like
caleb
didn't
just
get
in
the
game
he's
been
playing
for
a
while
and
i
wanna
know
where
whatever
it
takes
buffy
to
dawn
you
good
to
help
well
i
was

do
lots
and
lots
of
homework
but
darn
the
luck

dawn
buffy
doesn't
look
at
her
and
did
you
get
a
chance
to
talk
to
the
doctor
about
the

because
it
seemed
like—
hey
pipsqueak
why
don't
you
go
get
some
of
the
stuff
you've
already
gotten
from
giles
or
um

hasn't
looked
at
dawn
ok
yeah
i'll
be
right
back
dawn
leaves
the
room
try
to
find
anything

useless
in
just
one
punch
kennedy

one
night
monk
grabs
a
candelabra
some
time

a
man
arrived
at
our
doors
and
you
said
come
in
do
some
damage
we
are—we
are
a
benevolent
order
and
yes
we
welcomed
him
we
offered
to
feed
him
but
he
had
come
for
something
else
the
monk
walks
up
to
a
statue
of
mary
in
an
alcove
just
as
seen
on
the
picture
that
led
spike
here
in
the
first
place
he
touches
a
secret
lever
causing
the
statue
to
swing
out
of
the
way
revealing
a
secret
compartment
behind
it
behind
this
he
revealed
something
even
we
didn't
know
was
here
a
secret
room
monk
walks
in
spike
and
andrew
follow
he
was
excited
talking
the
whole
time
destiny
that
sort
of
thing
yeah
we
hear
he's
a
real
smooth
talker
monk
takes
a
tapestry
off
the
wall
revealing
an
inscription
behind
it
he
was
going
on
about
this
ancient
inscription
neat
he
read
it
and
he
didn't
like
what
it
said
his
temper
he
was
the
purest
evil
i've
ever
seen
he
burned
his
mark
upon
me
and
then
i
ran
and
i
hid
and
i
listened
to
the
others
die
running
awaysaved
your
life
andrew
spike
takes
the
candelabra
from
the
monk
and
walks
up
to
the
inscription
what
does
it
say
the
inscription
is
latin
words
written
with
greek
letters
non
tibi
est
ei
solae
tractare
licet
spike
translating
it
is
not
for
thee
it
is
for
her
alone

to
34
int
living
room
at
buffy's
house
night
buffy
addresses
the
meeting
of
giles
dawn
faith
willow
xander
robin
wood
and
all
the
potentials
in
her
living
room
xander
is
sitting
in
an
overstuffed
chair
with
dawn
sitting
beside
him
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
kennedy
is
sitting
on
the
sofa
with
willow
sitting
beside
her
on
the
arm
of
the
sofa
anya
is
standing
beside
willow
with
her
arms
crossed
look
i
know
what
you're
thinking
but
i
had
a
visit
at
the
school
today
from
caleb
buffy
why
didn't
you—
i'm
fine
i
mean
it
wasn't
fun
but
i'm
fine
i'm
better
than
fine
i—i
figured
something
out
he
kept
making
all
this
noise
about
the
school
is
it
that
seal
again
do
we
need
to
try
shutting
it
again
no
that's
just
it
we've
spent
all
this
time
worrying
about
the
seal
and
the
hellmouth
why
isn't
caleb
guarding
them
why
doesn't
he
have
someone
there
protecting
it
why
is
he
camped
out
at
the
vineyard
the
bad
guys
always
go
where
the
power
is
so
if
the
seal
was
so
important
to
caleb
and
the
first
they
would
be
there
right
now
they're
protecting
the
vineyard
or
something
at
the
vineyard
i
say
it's
their
power
and
i
say
it's
time
we
go
in
and
take
it
away
from
them
xander
shakes
his
head
and
looks
down
giles
uncrosses
his
arms
and
sighs
faith
standing
beside
robin
wood
with
her
arms
crossed
or
in
the
alternative
how
'boutwe
don't
i
mean
it's
a
neat
theory
b
but
i'm
not
going
back
in
that
place
not
without
proof
and
neither
should
you
and
neither
should
they
i'm
not
saying
it's
gonna
be
easy
i
think
faith
had
the
floor
maybe
it
ends
ok
the
way
you
wanna
play
it
but
maybe
it
doesn't
and
right
now
i
don't
think
i
want
you
playin'
the
odds
did
you
come
here
to
fight
listen
we're
fighters
all
of
us
but
you
gotta
give
me
something
to
fight
something
real
not—
giles
softly
windmills
giles
looks
at
buffy
there
is
something
there
maybe
but
we
can't
be
sure
of
that
this
is
a
hell
of
a
lot
to
ask
too
much
buffy
grinning
nervously
looks
around
i—i
don't
understand
this
for
7
years
i've
kept
us
safe
by
doing
this—
exactly
this
making
the
hard
decisions
and
now
what—
suddenly
you're
all
acting
like
you
can't
trust
me
didn't
you
say
to
me
today
you
can't
trust
us
maybe
there's
something
there
that
should
be
addressed
is
that
why
you
sent
spike
away
to
ambush
me
giles
rolls
his
eyes
sighs
oh
come
on
you
know
what
i
am
sick
of
your
deal
with
this
spike
guy
this
isn't
about
him
this
is
about
you
you're
being
reckless
buffy
steps
back
what
you
are
i
don't
even
know
you
and
i
can
tell
you
are
so
obsessed
with
beating
caleb
you
are
willing
to
jump
into
any
plan
without
thinking
buffy
through
gritted
teeth
that's
not
what
i'm
doing
kennedy
stands
walks
up
to
buffy
well
that's
how
it
feels
to
us
people
are
dying
willow
stands
walks
up
to
kennedy
kennedy
kennedy
turns
and
snaps
at
willow
why
are
you
always
standing
up
for
her
willow
softly
sadly
i'm
not
what
do
you
mean
you're
not
with
everything
that's
happened
i—
willow
shrugs
i'm
worried
about
your
judgment
buffy
looks
around
look
i
wish
this
could
be
a
democracy
i
really
do
democracies
don't
win
battles
buffy
xander
looks
away
it's
a
hard
truth
but
there
has
to
be
a
single
voice
you
need
someone
to
issue
orders
and
be
reckless
sometimes
and
not
take
your
feelings
into
account
you
need
someone
to
lead
you
anya
calmly
and
it's
automatically
you
anya
looks
at
buffy
you
really
do
think
you're
better
than
we
are
no
i—
but
we
don't
know
we
don't
know
if
you're
actually
better
i
mean
you
came
into
the
world
with
certain
advantages
sure
i
mean
that's
the
legacy
i—
anya
but
you
didn't
earn
it
you
didn't
work
for
it
you've
never
had
anybody
come
up
to
you
and
say
you
deserve
these
things
more
than
anyone
else
they
were
just
handed
to
you
so
that
doesn't
make
you
better
than
us
it
makes
you
luckier
than
us
i've
gotten
us
this
far
but
not
without
a
price
xander—
i'm
trying
to
see
your
point
here
buff
but
i
guess
it
must
be
a
little
bit
to
my
left
xander
shakes
his
head
'cause
i
just
don't
look
i'm
willing
to
talk
strategy
ok
i'll
hear
suggestions
on
how
to
break
this
down
but
this
is
the
plan
we
have
to
be
together
on
this
or
we
will
fail
again
we
are
clearly
demonstrating
that
we
are
not
together
on
this
buffy
commandingly
which
is
why
you
have
to
fall
in
line
i'm
still
in
charge
here
why
is
that
exactly
because
i'm
the
slayer
and
isn't
faith
a
slayer
too
faith
caught
off
guard
what
whoa
whoa
whoa
so
not
what
i
meant
i'm
not
in
charge
chick
i
think
b
here
needs
to
justchill
out
for
a
little
bit
take
a
siesta
or
something
but
i'm
not
the
one
you
want
maybe
we
need
a
vote
to
see
who
wants
faith
to
have
a
turn
in
charge
buffy
sternly
no
no
what
no
you
don't
get
to
vote
until
i've
had
my
chance
to
pal
around
you
know
get
everybody
drunk
see
i
didn't
get
this
was
a
popularity
contest
i
should
have
equal
time
to
bake
them
cookies
braid
their
hair—
learn
their
names
buffy
laughs
you're
just
lovin'
this
aren't
you
you
have
no
idea
what
i'm
feeling
buffy
low
mean
come
in
here

it
before

you

them

them
how
you

to
kill
people
for
fun
hey
you
guys
think
that's
nifty
buffy
that's
enough
i
didn't
come
here
to
take
anything
away
from
you
but
i'm
not
gonna
be
your
little
lapdog
either
i
came
here
to
beat
the
other
guy
to
do
right
however
it
works
i
don't
know
if
i
can
lead
but
the
real
question
iscan
you
follow
so
we
vote
wait
guys—
buffy
looks
around—anya's
crossed
her
arms
and
stares
back
with
pursed
lips
willow
looks
away—buffy
searches
their
faces
i
can't
watch
you
just
throw
away
everything
that—
buffy
looks
at
xander
and
at
dawn
who's
not
meeting
her
glance
buffy
holds
her
head
up
high
i
know
i'm
right
about
this
i
just
need
a
little—
i
can't
stay
here
and
watch
her
lead
you
into
some
disaster
dawn
stands
walks
up
to
buffy
softly
then
you
can't
stay
here
buffy
i
love
you
but
you
were
right
we
have
to
be
together
on
this
you
can't
be
a
part
of
it
dawn
buffy
blinks
her
eyes
in
disbelief
so
i
need
you
to
leave
i'm
sorry
but
this
is
my
house
too
buffy
looks
around
then
walks
out
the
front
door
ding
dong
the
witch
is
dead
dawn
low
angrily
shut
your
mouth
cut
to
35
ext

follows
buffy
outside
faith
concerned
hey

want
it
to
go
this
way—
buffy
sternly
don't
i
mean
it
i—
don'tbe
afraid
to
lead
them
buffy
buffy's
face
is
wet
with
tears
whether
you
wanted
it
or
not
their
lives
are
yours
it's
only
gonna
get
harder
protect
them
buffy

at
