prologue

fade
in
on
a
close
up
of
willow
she
has
her
eyes
closed
and
is
chanting
calmly
i
implore
you
neisa
blessed
goddess
of
chance
and
fortune
heed
my
call
send
to
me
the
heart
i
desire
the
camera
is
pulling
back
slowly
and
we
see
she
is
holding
five
cards
you
know
magic
at
the
poker
table
qualifies
as
cheating
in
xander's
basement
willow
is
sitting
on
xander's
foldedup
sofa
bed
and
anya
and
xander
are
sitting
on
large
bean
bags
around
the
coffee
table
they
have
sodas
and
bowls
of
potato
chips
and
pretzels
to
snack
on
that
wasn't
magic
i
was
praying
two
please
he
deals
her
two
cards
five
xander
ahn
i
keep
telling
you
four's
the
max
and
only
if
you
have
an
ace
okay
four
let's
see
the
ace
anya
sighs
three
anya
gives
up
the
cards
what
a
stupid
game
all
these
rules
just
to
win
little
plastic
disks
chips
they're
called
chips
they
represent
money
since
none
of
us
has
any
money
it
represents
money
but
that's
gonna
change
once
my
merchandise
hits
the
street
he
looks
at
them
invitingly
willow
takes
the
cue
willow
munching
on
a
pretzel
hmm
wha'cha
got
in
the
boxes
drugs
willow
then
sternly
it's
not
drugs
is
it
xander
not
drugs
he
gets
up
and
goes
to
the
work
bench
and
grabs
one
of
the
boxes
you
are
looking
at
the
new
local
distributor
for
boost
bars
'the
natural
food
bar
that
provides
a
nutritional
energy
boost
for
active
healthconscience
people'
xander
sits
want
one
no
thanks
those
things
usually
taste
kind
of
tasteless
and
then
leave
a
bad
aftertastelessness
xander
taking
out
a
bar
well
don't
let
the
healthy
scare
you
check
out
these
ingredients
xander
pointing
at
label
see
loaded
with
fatty
goodness
come
on
somebody
bet
already
i
got
three
'k'
cards
willow
and
xander
look
at
her
then
exchange
a
glance
they
fold
their
cards
anya
smiles
happily
and
begins
sliding
the
pot
of
chips
to
her
already
large
pile
xander
starts
to
gather
the
cards
up
to
shuffle
wish
the
buff
could've
made
it
this
threehand
poker
is
not
quite
the
game
guess
she's
out
with
riley
you
know
how
it
is
with
a
spanking
new
boyfriend
anya
offhandedly
while
stacking
her
chips
yes
we've
enjoyed
spanking
reacting
in
shock
the
cards
explode
from
xander's
hands
gaping
he's
about
to
say
something
to
anya
but
doesn't
seem
able
to
talk
well

xander
coughs
the
thing
is
i
think
riley
is
okay
in
an
oafish
kind
of
way
but
am
i
the
only
one
with
a
big
floating
question
mark
over
his
head
about
this
initiative
thing
well
they
do
seem
to
fall
into
the
'good
guy'
camp
i
mean
they
are
antidemon
willow
sees
anya's
evil
eye
expression
probably
pro
exdemon
maybe
i
choose
to
feel
threatened
xander
gathering
cards
again
and
why
not
there's
still
heaps
we
don't
know
about
these
commandos
what
exactly
are
they
up
to
cut
to
somewhere
in
the
woods
night
time
a
few
of
the
initiative
commandos
prowling
through
the
trees
and
bushes
in
low
crouches
they're
all
wearing
their
dark
ski
masks
and
armed
with
taser
rifles
the
lead
commando
silently
motions
them
forward
and
three
of
them
disappear
into
a
tall
stretch
of
bushes
cut
to
long
shot
and
we
start
to
hear
fighting
and
a
second
later
one
of
the
commandos
comes
flying
out
of
the
bushes
landing
at
least
ten
yards
away
closer
shot
buffy
jumps
out
of
the
bushes
and
there's
already
two
more
commandos
down
and
out
on
the
ground
around
her
a
fourth
and
fifth
commando
charge
her
from
either
side
buffy
greets
the
fourth
commando
with
quick
alternating
front
kicks
that
the
commando
blocks
but
the
impact
sends
him
off
balance
buffy
spins
into
a
roundhouse
kick
into
the
face
of
the
fifth
commando
as
he
comes
up
behind
her
he
recovers
quickly
and
swings
a
punch
that
she
ducks
and
sends
him
down
with
a
right
hook
then
she
turns
to
the
fourth
commando
who's
up
again
she
fakes
him
with
a
high
backhand
that
he
blocks
then
brings
that
fist
down
to
hammer
punch
him
in
the
groin
making
him
hunch
around
his
pain
but
her
attention
is
already
on
the
fifth
commando
and
she
blocks
a
midlevel
uppercut
catching
it
and
has
him
in
an
arm
lock
she
sends
a
back
kick
into
the
fourth
commando's
chest
sending
him
to
the
ground
buffy
swings
her
captured
commando
around
just
as
the
lead
commando
pops
out
of
some
bushes
with
his
taser
rifle
and
fires
the
blast
hits
the
helpless
commando
and
he
spasms
as
rings
of
electricity
course
through
his
body
buffy
lets
him
drop
to
the
ground
and
readies
herself
as
the
lead
commando
charges
her
they
are
about
to
fight
when
walsh
os
lights
the
brights
of
a
humvee
parked
up
on
a
gradual
hill
illuminates
the
area
and
buffy
and
the
lead
commando
turn
to
see
professor
maggie
walsh
in
a
dark
wool
coat
hurrying
down
to
them
she
walks
past
the
lead
commando
who
his
pulling
off
his
mask
and
we
see
it's
riley
finn
walsh
stands
in
front
of
buffy
and
regards
her
with
a
stoic
expression
it
took
the
patrol
team
42
minutes
to
track
you
and
you
neutralized
them
in
28
seconds
buffy
glances
at
riley
behind
walsh
i
was
just
lucky
i
see
walsh
riley
starts
to
smile
well
still
very
impressive
walsh
turns
and
riley
quickly
wipes
the
smile
off
his
face
she
heads
back
to
the
humvee
buffy
watches
her
leave
as
riley
steps
up
to
her
i
was
just
being
modest
with
the
whole
'lucky'
thing
you
got
that
right
again
riley
has
a
'shine
a
flashlight
on
his
teeth
and
blind
yourself'
smile
on
his
face
as
he
looks
down
at
her
i
got
it
the
rest
of
the
commandos
are
getting
to
their
feet
and
taking
their
masks
off
graham
miller
passes
buffy
on
her
right
awesome
buffy
forrest
gates
walks
past
her
on
her
left
without
saying
a
word
looking
a
little
pissed
he
has
a
hand
on
his
back
and
stops
for
a
moment
to
look
over
his
shoulder
pfft
forrest
continues
on
riley
still
smiling
see
you're
a
hit
everybody
loves
you
he
puts
an
arm
around
her
shoulders
and
they
follow
the
others
cut
to
walsh
standing
beside
the
humvee
looking
on
she
doesn't
look
happy

cafe
panning
shot
to
willow
and
buffy
sitting
at
a
table
across
from

coffee
buffy
sounds
excited
as
she
tells
willow
about
last
night
for
her
part
willow
has
a
happy
'listening
even
though
she
really
doesn't
want
to
hear
this'
look
on
her
face
so
then
professor
walsh
said
that
i
was
just
as
amazing
as
riley
had
said
and
later
he
told
me
that
she
couldn't
stop
talking
about
this
move
i
made
where
i
used
one
of
the
commandos
as
a
shield
to
block
a
taser
blast
it
was
like
twelvethousand
volts
it
took
the
guy
almost
two
hours
to
recover
buffy
takes
a
sip
of
her
coffee
willow

to
have
a
crack
at

while
i'd
loved
to
go
on
trading

with
you

perhaps
i'll
come
to
the
point
as
much
as
it
pains
me
to
say
it
um
i
owe
you
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
the
help
you
provided
me
in
my
recent
metamorphosis

starts
counting
the

giles
looks
the
place
over
um
thinking
about
your
affliction
and
uh
your
newfound
discovery
that
you
can
fight
only
demons
it
occurs
to
me
that
giles
chuckling
i
realize
this
is
completely
against
your
nature
but
iii
has
it
occurred
to
you
that

may
be
a
higher
purpose
ugh
you
made
me
lose
count
spike
faces
him
what
are
you

to
brag
buffy
looks
at
him
and
a
grin
breaks
his
face
buffy
looking
down
again
i
had
no
idea
this
is
incredible
but
not
that
i
thought
it
was
some
flybynight
operation
buffy
turns
to
him
excited
unless

eyes
and
riley
leans
down
about
to
kiss
her

so
you
like
our
little
operation
they
turn
to
see
walsh
standing
behind
them
on
the
catwalk
yeah

it's
very
clean
walsh
approaches
and
hands
her
a
small
plastic
clipon
badge
your
visitor's

the
pass
to
her
leather
jacket
and
takes
the
papers
walsh
offers
her
buffy
frowns

never
gonna
get
homework
from
you
again
you
can't
take
that
home
that's
classified
material
highly
sensitive
when
you're
through
reading
those
pages
you'll
have
to
eat
them
buffy
just
stares
at
her
speechless
she
looks
up
at
riley
riley
grinning
she's
joking
don't
worry
it
doesn't
happen
very
often
shall
we
buffy
exchanges
another
glance
with
riley
and
they
follow
moments
later
they've
made
their
way
down
the
metal
staircase
and
walsh
is
leading
them
towards
the
open
center
of
the
complex
they
stop
at
the
metal
railing
and
look
down
much
of
our

performed
here
we
call
this
'the

buffy
sees
a
pair
of
green
squidfaced
demons
laying
on
two
tables
while
scrubclad
techs
work
on
them
and
what
do
you
call
those
tough
it
took
eight
of
us
to
bring
those
two
down
they'll
be
under
our
control
soon
enough

cut
to
a
man
in

talking
with

he's
a
leader
in
the
field
of
xenomorphic
behavior
modification
behavior
modification
we've
made
significant
advances
in
reconditioning
the
subterrestrials
bringing
them
to
a
point
where
they
no
longer
pose
a
threat
buffy
to
herself
so
i've
seen
then
she
sees
walsh
and
riley's
expressions
as
they
look
at
her
on
the
discovery
channel
with
gorillas
and
sharks
theythey
made
them
all
nice
you
haven't
seen
it
they
don't
say
anything
but
walsh
doesn't
look
convinced
buffy
turns
her
attention
away
and
points
across
the
complex
what's
over
there
she
starts
to
walk
casually
in
that
direction
and
riley
and
walsh
follow
seconds
later
walsh
is
in
the
lead
again
as
they
approach
an
area
closed
off
by
a
chainlink
fence
inside
are
large
caches
of
guns
and
equipment
of
all
types
there
is
one
commando
on
duty
inside
the
armory
you'll
have
to
be
cleared
for
use
on
each
of
these
weapons
but
by
this
point
buffy
must
have
felt
like
she
was
back
in
class
for
her
attention
has
already
wandered
and
she
steps
up
to
a
table
behind
walsh
and
riley
she
sees
a
small
looking
device
laying
in
an
open
case
as
she
lifts
it
up
the
image
on
the
monitor
behind
her
also
moves
and
we
see
a
closeup
of
buffy's
eye
as
she
holds
the
device
close
to
her
face
walsh
while
this
is
happening
the
more
advance
arsenal
can
be
complicated
but
i'm
certain
in
time
you'll
pick
that
up
walsh
looks
over
her
shoulder
and
sees
what
buffy's
doing
don't
pick
that
up
walsh
walks
to
her
and
quickly
takes
it
from
her
what
is
it
about
twentythousand
dollars
it's
a
prototype
for
a
comcam
riley
points
to
the
monitor
behind
her
communications
camera
soon
to
be
standard
issue
gives
us
a
direct
comlink
to
control
when
we're
out
in
the
field
also
monitors
the
heart
rate
of
the
wearer
a
valuable
tool
for
research
in
stress
in
combat
condition
if
you'll
follow
me
i'll
show
you
the
sht
containment
area
walsh
walks
off
and
buffy
looks
to
riley
mouthing
'sorry'
riley
shakes
his
head
with
a
smile
telling
her
not
to
worry
as
they
follow
some
time
later
the
tour
is
coming
to
an
end
walsh
stops
to
face
buffy
we
have
a
few
more
things
to
give
you
buffy
pointing
what's
in
there
quick
shot
of
the
metal
security
door
we
saw
in
the
last
episode
a
lab
coat
scientist
uses
a
id
card
to
open
the
door
and
disappears
inside
research
area
very
restricted
for
security
reasons
here
is
your
security
card
and
your
pager
she
accepts
the
items
from
walsh
and
studies
the
pager
been
thinking
about
getting
one
of
these
we're
the
only
ones
with
the
number
and
it
stays
that
way
right
lose
either
one
of
them
and
there's
hell
to
pay
and
down
here
we
mean
that
literally
walsh
offers
her
hand
and
she
actually
smiles
as
she
shakes
buffy's
hand
again
welcome
to
the
team
cut
to
student
lounge
willow
and
tara
are
sitting
on
sofa
chairs
leaning
on
the
arm
rests
tara
is
holding
a
clear
purplepink
crystal
in
the
palms
of
her
hands
this
is
so
cool
wow

entire
life
well
since
june
anyway

my
grandma's

have
it
oh

tara
ththat's
really
sweet
i
can't
it's
like
a
family
heirloom

feel
comfortable
tara
looks
a
little
hurt
and
she
puts
the
crystal
away
willow
see
this
but
iif
you
wanted
to
try
out
some
spells
with
it
some
time
i
wouldn't
say
no
tara
eager
maybe
tonight
i
mean
if
you're
not
doing
something
you
could
come
over
and
we
could
do
something
tara
smiles
willow
uncomfortable
tonight
that
sounds
really
nice
but
tonight
i
uh
already
have
plans
with
people
other
tara
hurt
again
oh
um
that's
okay
another
time
absolutely
it's
just
tonight
itit's
kind
of
a
specific
crowd
you
might
feel
out
of
place
tara
is
silent
for
a
moment
i
better
get
to
class
she
grabs
her
books
and
stands
up
willow
stands
up
with
her
well
um
i'll
see
ya
later
okay
tara
just
nods
and
walks
off
cut
to
initiative
headquarters
walsh
walks
up
to
the
metal
security
door
and
zips
her
security
card
through
the
keypad
the
door
unlocks
and
she
steps
inside
she
continues
down
the
corridor
to
another
door
and
punches
in
a
code
and
slides
the
cards
again
she
enters
and
as
the
door
closes
the
number
314
is
on
it
cut
to
interior
of
the
lab
room
walsh
closes
the
door
behind
her
dr
angleman
who
just
got
through
washing
his
hands
at
a
sink
turns
to
face
her
as
he
dries
them
how
did
the
tour
go
i'm
not
sure
she's
unpredictable
she
walks
across
the
room
her
attention
is
on
something
we
cannot
see
she's
an
unnecessary
risk
possibly
how's
our
baby
doing
today
adjusting
nicely
reflexes
motorfunctions
all
off
the
charts
that's
what
i
like
to
hear
walsh
to
whatever
she's
looking
at
almost
time
to
wake
up
adam
cut
to
the
lab
table
we
see
a
young
man
laying
under
a
blanket
only
his
chest
and
head
visible
but
he
doesn't
look
like
a
normal
man
his
brown
hair
is
neatly
trimmed
the
most
normal
feature
while
more
than
half
of
his
face
is
covered
in
dark
green
skin
the
rest
of
his
face
a
human
pale
there
is
also
metal
plating
on
the
green
left
side
of
his
face
from
jaw
to
temple
most
of
his
chest
is
also
green
as
well
as
is
his
right
shoulder
but
we
can
also
see
patches
of
other
different
types
of
skin
wherever
skins
meet
there
is
a
line
of
sutured
or
weldedon
scars
like
a
grotesque
demonic
jigsaw
there
seems
to
be
numerous
iv
lines
and
monitoring
connections
disappearing
under
the
blanket
walsh
soft
voice
and
take
your
first
look
at
the
world
i
know
you're
gonna
make
me
proud
part

to
the
bronze

playing
'trashed'
by
lavish
and
people
mostly
young
are
socializing
camera
pans
over
to
where
willow
and
anya
are
sitting
at
a
table
willow
is
lifting
her
sleeve
to
check
her
watch
probably
not
for
the
first
time
xander
is
walking
to
them
while
unwrapping
a
boost
bar
and
taking
a
bite
anya
indignantly
xander

haven't
been
paying
any
attention

let's
face
it

hour
late

probably
out
living
the
life
of
riley
i
don't
think
she's

she
is
willow
unconvincingly
she
said
she
was
looking
forward
to
spending
quality
time
with
just
us
willow
brightens
see
here
she
comes
shot
of
buffy
walking
into
the
bronze
followed
by
riley
graham
forrest
and
two
other
guys
'keep
myself
awake'
by
black
lab
starts
to
play
willow
crestfallen
with
riley
and
some
other
guys
buffy
and
the
young
men
reach
their
table
hi

lateitude

hope
you
don't
mind
us
tagging
along
willow
forced
smile
no
no
of
course
not
the
more
the
more
this
is
graham
this
is
forrest
that's
kevin
and
that's
jay

the
back
how

some
drinks

they
look
to
anya
with
the
offer
anya
frowns
we're
going
away
to
dance
over
there
she
stands
up
and
takes
xander's
arm
xander
being
dragged
away
we
are
riley
and
the
guys
head
over
to
the
bar
and
buffy
sits
on
anya's
stool
across
from
willow
anya
seems
a
bit
on
edge
she's
a
little
angsty
around
commandotypes
exdemon
issues
oh
buffy
points
to
the
guys
you
know
i
didn't
think
that
you
would
mind
riley
and
the
guys
were
throwing
a
little
impromptu
celebration
in
my
honor
and
made
it
like
impossible
to
not
invite
them
oh
that's
neat
about
the
celebrating
i
just
thought
this
was
supposed
to
be
you
know
just
us
just
the
scooby
corps
you
know
i
mean
i
could
have
invited
somebody
else
if
i
knew
it
was
an
open
freeforall
i'm
sorry
i
had
no
idea
my
total
bad
buffy
grins
so
who
did
you
want
to
invite
what
you
said
you
wanted
to
invite
someone
willow
nervously
no
not
no
one
i
meant
a
hypothetical
someone
which
is
to
say
no
one
what
are
we
celebrating
buffy
lowers
voice
but
excited
i'm
in
the
initiative
professor
walsh
gave
me
the
grand
tour
and
we're
talking
grand
as
in
canyon
you'd
never
believe
the
size
of
it
that's
really
again
i
say
'neat'
so
what
do
you
mean
exactly
you've
joined
them
no
nnot
exactly
it
just
means
that
when
i
patrol
i'll
have
a
heavily
armed
team
backing
me
up
buffy
smiles
plus
boyfriend
going
to
work
with
me
big
extra
perk
buffy
do
you
really
think
this
is
a
good
idea
i
mean
don't
you
think
you're
rushing
things
a
little
buffy
frowns
i
thought
you
liked
riley
not
with
riley
with
the
initiative
i
mean
there's
a
bunch
of
stuff
about
them
we
still
don't
know
i
know
that
buffy
then
like
what
well
what's
their
ultimate
agenda
i
mean
okay
yeah
theythey
neuter
vampires
and
demons
but
then
what
are
they
gonna
reintegrate
them
into
society
get
them
jobs
as
bagboys
at
walmart
buffy
in
serious
thought
does
walmart
have
bagboys
plus
don't
forget
that
'314'
thing
that
ethan
told
giles
about
well
a
man
that
worships
chaos
and
tries
to
kill
you
is
a
man
you
can
trust
well
bad
info
or
not
i
just
think
there's
certain
questions
you
should
ask
before
you
go
off
and
enlist
a
pager
goes
off
and
buffy
reaches
into
her
bag
to
pull
it
out
two
seconds
later
five
more
beepers
go
off
at
the
bar
and
riley
checks
his
pager
that's
us
let's
go
when
did
you
get
a
pager
what's
going
riley
steps
up
to
the
table
and
buffy
stands
up
that's
our
cue
mother
wants
us
buffy
turns
to
willow
will

i
know
talk
later
she
doesn't
look
happy
as
she
watches
buffy
leave
with
riley
and
the
others
so
what's
the
big
emergency
cut
to
briefing
area
at
initiative
hq
there
is
an
overhead
projector
displaying
the
image
of
an
ugly
demon
on
a
large
white
screen
riley
is
standing
to
one
side
of
the
screen
as
professor
walsh
walks
in
front
of
the
group
of
commandos
seated
in
rows
before
her
among
them
near
the
back
buffy
sticks
out
as
a
girl
in
a
sea
of
broadshouldered
military
green
this
is
your
objective
subt
67119
demon
class
polgara
species
though
visual
confirmation
has
not
yet
been
made
we're
confident
of
the
target's
approximate
position
as
it
leaves
behind
a
distinct
protein
marker
dr
angleman
will
brief
you
on
its
defenses
she
takes
a
seat
to
the
side
as
dr
angleman
steps
up
next
to
the
projector
and
overlays
a
second
transparent
page
over
the
first
this
adds
long
sharp
looking
protrusions
from
the
demon's
arms
when
threatened
bone
skewers
jut
from
the
creature's
forearms
during
battle
it's
imperative
when
ensnaring
it
not
to
damage
its
arms
that's
all
you
really
need
to
know
amidst
the
commandos
buffy
raises
her
hand
question
dr
angleman
doesn't
seem
sure
how
to
respond
unaccustomed
by
this
he
glances
at
walsh
who
stands
up
again
buffy
why
exactly
can't
we
damage
this
polka
thing's
arms
i
uh
not
that
i
want
to
it's
just
in
my
experience
when
fighting
for
your
life
body
parts
get
damaged
and
better
its
bits
than
mine
buffy
glances
at
the
guys
around
her
or
ours
we
wish
to
study
the
physiology
of
every
subterrestrial's
natural
defenses
it's
part
of
the
research
we
do
here
angleman
pauses
before
he
can
continue
uh
yes
we
see
that
buffy
had
her
hand
raised
again
what
do
they
want
want
why
are
they
here
sacrifices
treasure
or
they
just
get
rampagy
buffy
she
is
starting
to
get
looks
from
the
commandos
i
find
it's
easier
to
predict
their
responses
if
i
know
they're
not
sentient
just
destructive
i
believe
they
do
have
keen
eyesight
however
you
might
want
to
be
suited
up
for
this
oh
buffy
glancing
at
the
military
green
around
her
you
mean
the
cammo
and
stuff
i
thought
about
it
but
i
mean
it's
gonna
look
all
'private
benjamin'
this
gets
chuckles
from
some
of
the
commandos
don't
worry
i've
patrolled
in
this
halter
many
times
this
gets
even
more
chuckles
and
riley
has
to
bow
his
head
and
clench
his
jaw
to
keep
from
laughing
his
ass
off
why
don't
we
give
our
attention
to
dr
angleman
buffy
raises
hand
and
save
all
questions
until
the
end
actually
i'm
finished
oh
uh
well
agent
finn
deploy
the
teams
all
business
riley
walks
out
in
front
of
the
group
okay
listen
up
we'll
be
going
in
a
four
squad
setup
team
leaders
gates
taggart
and
stavros
alpha
team
you're
with
me
report
for
tls
for
assignment
and
weapons
requisitions
reminder
this
is
a
zapntrap
people
capture
not
a
kill
any
questions
walsh
sees
a
raised
hand
walsh
sighing
buffy
cut
to
the
front
of
a
closed
door
it
opens
and
it's
tara's
room
she
is
surprised
to
see
the
person
who
is
standing
in
the
hallway
willow
willow
sheepishly
a
funny
thing
happened
with
my
prior
social
engagement
pretty
much
ended
when
a
friend
of
mine
went
off
to
do
something
with
another
crowd
she
hangs
out
with
irony
is
kind
of
ironic
that
way
willow
hopefully
anyway
i
know
it's
late
but
ii
thought
maybe
i
mean
if
you
still
wanted
to
do
something
tara
just
smiles
and
opens
the
door
wider
to
let
her
inside
she
closes
the
door
cut
to
a
wooded
area
alpha
team
is
on
patrol
buffy
is
with
them
she
is
walking
beside
riley
three
other
commandos
behind
them
she's
wearing
a
jacket
over
her
halter
top
and
looks
a
little
glum
with
her
hands
shoved
in
the
pockets
so
i
guess
she
hates
me
now
riley
distracted
what
professor
walsh
questions
an
initiative
faux
pas
yes
it's
a
little
unusual
she's
just
not
used
to
it
maybe
because
you
barely
ever
opened
your
mouth
in
her
classroom
but
i
know
she
likes
you
in
fact
she
liked
you
before
i
did
buffy
hopeful
really
told
me
so
herself
maybe
i
should
get
her
a
present
or
something
riley
stops
buffy
can
we
talk
about
this
later
there's
a
dangerous
hostile
out
here
and
since
i
don't
have
your
reflexes
i
kinda
need
to
focus
right
right
they
start
walking
again
after
a
moment
she
looks
at
him
what
do
you
mean
she
liked
me
before
you
did
riley
oops
uh

you
didn't
like
me
as
riley
tries
to
take
his
boot
out
of
his
mouth
the
camera
pans
to
see
what
beta
team
is
up
to
they're
stationed
within
a
cluster
of
bushes
graham
is
scanning
the
area
with
night
vision
goggles
and
forrest
is
standing
beside
him
forrest
seems
to
be
in
a
mood
of
his
own
forrest
grumbling
it
just
isn't
right
he
made
you
team
leader
didn't
he
that's
not
the
point
i've
always
been
riley's
second
in
command
instead
he
picks
a
girl
his
girl
whatever
three
guesses
on
what
that
boy
is
thinking
with
maybe
he
just
wanted
to
give
you
a
chance
to
get
out
from
under
his
shadow
hey
i'm
not
under
anybody's
shadow
it
was
a
joke
man
don't
get
your
panties
in
a
bunch
i'm
just
saying
graham

is
kissing

over

caresses
her

is
suddenly
sucking
one
of
his
fingers
as
he
kisses
her
shoulder
cut

now
buffy
ducks
under
another
of
the
polgara's
swings
riley
picks
up
a
fallen
taser
gun
and
takes
aim
but
buffy
is
too
close
to
the
creature
for
a
clear
shot
cut
to
riley's
room
buffy
lays
back
on
riley's
bed
and
he
slowly
lowers
himself
down
on

a
couple
of
missing
frames
and
they're
kissing
she's
caressing
his
chest
cut

shouts
'now'
and
he
and
another
commando
unleash
their
tasers
the
demon
is
blasted
by
the
bursts
of
electricity
and
the
other
two
commandos
are
readying
a
heavy
net
behind
it
cut
to
riley's
room

is
now
on

and
lowers

down
on
riley
more
deep
kissing
his
arms
around

now
they
have
the
polgara
in
the
net
and
it's
struggling
while
buffy
gets
to
her
feet
the
audio
returns
and
slowmo
ends
as
she
snaps
a
front
kick
into
its
face
knocking
the
creature
out
the
commandos
wrap
things
up
and
buffy
takes
a
few
steps
back
breathing
heavy
riley
stands
beside
her
they
face
each
other
so
what
do
you
want
to
do
now
before
he
says
anything
cut
to
riley's
room
which
becomes
now
and
riley
is
on
top
again
as
they
continue
to
make
love
the
music
is
replaced
by
a
more
sinister
theme
as
we
cut
to
a
black
and
white
ceilingshot
of
riley's
room
the
camera
pulls
back
and
we
see
we're
looking
into
a
surveillance
monitor
there
is
a
label
on
top
of
the
monitor
that
has
'finn'
written
on
it
as
the
shot
continues
to
pull
back
we
see
two
more
monitors
to
either
side
of
it
with
similar
shots
of
currently
empty
rooms
one
is
labeled
'gates'
the
other
'miller'
a
control
panel
becomes
visible
under
the
row
of
monitors
there
are
two
reels
of
tape
spinning
obviously
in
'record'
mode
and
there
is
someone
sitting
in

of
the
control
panel
cut
to
closing
shot
of
professor

her
right
eye
twitches
once
as

watches

and
hands
it
to

tears
the
aluminum
off
the
end
and
takes
a
bite
he
quickly
stops
chewing
and
there
is
a
disgusted
look
on
his
face
giles
menacingly
please
leave
my
home
now
he
drops
the
boost
bar
on
the
coffee
table
and
searches
for
something
to
spit
in
trying
to
save
the
sale
xander
grabs
another
bar
from
a
different
box
it's
the
uh

gritty
texture

a
cherryberry
fellow
there

a
pounding
on

of
zipping
his
lips
shut

shrugs

stoic
but
hard
expression

digs
out
the
money
from
his
coat
pocket
and
slams
it
into

is
in
his

wakes
up

her
eyes
take
in
her

worried
she
suddenly
rolls
over
and
finds
riley
lying
next
to
her
already

riley
smiling

what
to
expect
they're
secure
enough
with
their
morning
breaths
and
start
kissing
in
a
lazy
manner
an
electronic
chirping
sound
fills
the
room
buffy
laughing
your
robot
bird
sounds
hungry
it's
just
a
reminder
to
take
my
vitamins
he
rolls
over
and
grabs
a
medicine
bottle
on
his
nightstand
as
the
chirping
ends
buffy
teasing
you're
kidding
he
downs

as
he
pulls
his

down
we
see
his
latexed
fingers
are
bloodied
the
slayer
walsh
begins
to
pace
she's
becoming
a
liability
we
knew
that
was
a
danger
does
she
know
about
the
project
she
knows
it
exists
she
already
holds
too
much
influence
over
riley
over
agent
finn
we
move
to
the
contingency
scenario
right
away
angleman
is
now
using
scissor
clamps
on
the
something
we
still
can't
see
that's
too
bad
she
could
have
been
a
powerful
ally
i
know
and
finn
will
take
it
hard
that's
why
sooner
is
better
we
finally
see
what
angleman
was
working
on
as
he
lifts
the

arm
severed
at
the
shoulder
of
the
polgara
demon
lying
on

he
moves

to
buffy
and
willow's
dorm
room
in
stevenson
hall
buffy
walks
inside
and
closes
the
door
behind
her
the
room
is
empty
and
she
sees
that
willow's
bed
is
just
as
undisturbed
as
her
own
she
goes
to
her
desk
to
put
down
her
bag
and
takes
off
her
jacket
she's
no
longer
wearing
the
infamous
halter
top
she's
wearing
a
dark
longsleeve
blouse
the
door
opens
behind
her
and
willow
walks
in
oh
hi
hey
buffy
indicating
the
bed
out
all
night
huh
you
too
yeah
they're
silent
for
a
moment
and
willow
is
fidgeting
with
something
in
her
hand
it's
the
dollseye
crystal
she
had
refused
from
tara
yesterday
she
walks
to
her
side
of
the
room
and
sets
it
on
top
of
her
dresser
sorry
about
bailing
on
you

willow
glances
at
the
crystal
then
to
buffy
don't

about
it
buffy
smiles

buffy's
pager
goes
off
and
she
retrieves
it
from
her
bag

blue
jeans

watches
her
leave
then
the
phone
rings
and
she
crosses
the
room
to
answer
it

new
cordless

to
do
cut
to
initiative
headquarters
buffy
is
walking
with
walsh
it's
a
small
job
reconnaissance
probably
a
waste
of
a
slayer's
abilities
but
my
boys
are
on
assignment
so
i
buffy
no
it's
okay
i'm
up
for
some
action
i
doubt
you'll
get
any
on
this
one
they
reach
a
table
and
walsh
points
to
a
map
we
have
a
reading
of
a
class
three
subterrestrial
moving
through
the
sewer
tunnels
just
on
the
edge
of
town
class
three
it's
a
lowlevel
threat
minimal
aggression
meager
defenses
professor
walsh
commando
walks
up
and
hands
her
a
taser
rifle
they
barely
show
up
on
the
scanner
and
occasionally
turn
out
to
be
raccoons
walsh
hands
the
weapon
to
buffy
buffy
examining
it
wow
you're
not
crazy
about
raccoons
huh
we
always
take
precautions
walsh
picks
up
the
comcam
from
the
table
all
we
need
you
to
do
is
get
a
visual
on
this
thing
this
will
feed
me
back
an
image
and
i
can
advise
you
from
there
i
don't
want
to
put
you
in
any
unnecessary
danger
walsh
hands
it
to
buffy
oh
that's
okay
danger's
my
birthright
not
used
to
such
a
weapon
buffy
carelessly
lets
the
barrel
point
towards
walsh
who
casually
diverts
the
weapon
away
with
her
hand
sorry
um
professor
walsh
there's
uh
there's
still
some
stuff
about
all
this
that
i'm
not
clear
on
walsh
a
beat
well
when
you
get
back
we
can
have
a
talk
good
okay
when
i
get
back
buffy
turns
to
leave
then
stops
am
i
supposed
to
salute
you
no
okay
buffy
walks
off
and
walsh
glances
down
at
the
table
then
she
looks
over
her
shoulder
to
watch
buffy
leave
cut
to
giles'
apartment
panning
shot
from
the
cognac
bottle
hanging
loosely
in
spike's
hand
we
see
he
has
a
barely
conscious
expression
on
his
face
he's
now
laying
across
the
cleared
surface
of
giles'
desk
xander
and
anya
are
still
in
normal
positions
as
giles
continues
to
work
on
the
wound
and
willow
is
now
there
standing
to
one
side
she
is
reading
from
her
'witchcraft'
spellbook
in
one
arm
and
is
holding
the
dollseye
crystal
in
her
other
palm
willow
chanting
spell
tropo
strato
meso
aero
iono
exo

xander
to
giles
so
how
is
this
supposed
to
work
again
if
she
succeeds
her
spell
will
ionize
the
atmosphere
around
us
thereby
disrupting
the
tracer's
signal
buys
us
time
willow
chanting
elements
are
brought
to
bear
wind
earth
and
water
churn
amidst
the
fire
let
the
air
be
burned
they
all
jump
as
the
spell
takes
effect
and
there
is
a
shot
of
every
lightbulb
in
the
apartment
exploding
willow
os
did
it
work
is
the
atmosphere
ionized
shot
of
our
gang
their
hair
is
standing
up
we
can't
see
spike's
hair
in
this
shot
they
glance
at
one
another
and
static
electricity
can
be
heard
doing
the
'snap
crackle
pop'
in
their
hair
giles
deadpan
i'd
venture
yes
cut
to
wooded
area
riley
has
joined
up
with
beta
team
and
forrest
is
on
point
with
the
tracer
receiver
beeping
in
his
hand
what
do
you
mean
the
signal's
whacked
i
mean
the
blips
a
blob
some
kind
of
interference
messing
with
the
tracer
try
to
lock
it
down
we
headed
in
the
right
general
direction
they
stop
as
forrest
tries
to
get
a
bearing
forrest
sighs
i
think
so
it's
gonna
put
us
in
populated
areas
okay
then
we
change
into
civvies
and
then
move
out
maybe
something
will
turn
up
they
continue
on
cut
to
buffy
in
the
sewers
we
see
her
emerging
from
a
tunnel
and
she
steps
inside
a
larger
chamber
she's
armed
with
the
taser
rifle
and
is
wearing
the
comcam
hooked
over
her
left
ear
she
hears
a
snarling
sound
coming
from
deep
in
the
chamber
buffy
into
mic
professor
walsh
are
you
getting
this
possible
sht
make
it
a
definite
she
sees
a
green
squidfaced
demon
step
out
wearing
ragged
robes
and
carrying
a
long
battle
ax
a
second
demon
steps
out
with
it
also
armed
with
a
battle
ax
and
he's
brought
along
a
friend
they
seem
buffy
suddenly
flashbacks
to
her
tour
at
the
initiative
and
remembers
seeing
these
two
demons
being
worked
on
in
'the
pit'
buffy
aims
the
taser
rifle
at
them
and
pulls
the
trigger
the
weapon
shortcircuits
with
a
burst
of
sparks
and
buffy
drops
it
from
the
shock
she
turns
to
flee
the
way
she
came
but
a
barred
gate
is
dropping
in
place
blocking
her
escape
into
the
tunnel
buffy
looks
at
the
approaching
demons
and
has
a
'oh
fuck
me'
expression
on
her
face
part
four

back
where
we
left
buffy
she
is
standing
on
a
threefoot
raised
section
as
she
watches
the
demons
approach
on
the
ground
level
the
taser
rifle
is
still
shortcircuiting
shooting
sparks
the
demons
charge
and
she
hops
down
hitting
them
with
alternating
front
kicks
the
second
demon
is
quicker
to
recover
and
swings
the
ax
down
at
her
head
she
side
steps
and
kicks
it
in
the
back
of
the
knee
throwing
it
off
balance
and
sends
a
back
kick
into
the
first
demon
the
second
demon
gets
up
again
smashing
the
ax
handle
into
her
chin
turning
her
around
the
first
demon
is
swinging
its
ax
at
her
and
she
catches
the
handle
with
her
hands
as
they
struggling
with
it
the
second
demon
slams
the
handle
of
its
ax
into
the
small
of
her
back
the
first
demon
uses
this
to
wrest
free
its
weapon
from
buffy's
hold
and
she
falls
to
the
ground
in
a
shoulder
roll
as
she
stands
back
up
to
face
the
demons
cut
to
a
black

of
the

the
rhythm
of
her
heart
beat
and
that
her
bpm
is
145
her
hands
are
raised
in
a
fighting
stance
and
the
picture
starts
to
jerk
wildly
as
she
dodges
the
demons'
attacks
heard
are
her
sounds
of
exertion
and
the
growls
of
the
creatures
cut
to
walsh
standing
in

a

walsh

around

she
is

she
calmly
takes

fighting
returning
to
the

match
already
in

they
have

surrounded
and
the

charges
but
she
deflects
the
ax
and
shoves
the
creature
into
the
second
the
demon
pinning
it
against
the
wall
she
steps
forward
with
an
inward
crescent
kick
to
knock
the
ax
aside
and
slams
a
right
fist
into
its
gut
not
missing
a
beat
she's
already
following
through
with
a
hard
left
hook
as
the

demon
bends
forward
giving
her
a
clear
shot
at
the
second

face
she
raises
a
knee
into
the
first
demon's
face
making
him
stand

again
and
then
spins
into
a
jumping
back
kick
slamming
them
both
against

again
stunned
the

falls
on

but
the

charges
buffy
she's
able
to
grab
the
handle
of
its
ax
as
it
drives
her
back
into
the
opposite
wall
she
wrestles
with
it
as
the
first
demon
gets
back
to
its
feet
and
starts
to
swing
its
ax
directly
at
buffy
in
the
last
instant
she
twists
the

around
in

quickly
follows
through
into
another
swing
and
she
catches
the
handle
again
she
diverts
the
blade
away
from
her
and
takes
a
quick
punch
at
the
creature's
face
it's
stunned
and
she
rips
the
ax
from
its
grip
and
the
weapon
flies
away
from
them
but
buffy
is
off
balance
as
she
backs
away
the
demon
takes
advantage
by
punching
her
hard
in
the
face
sending
her
to

to

she
snatches
up
the

and
tosses
it
at
the
demon's
feet
it
hits
the

and
electricity
dances
over
the
creature
as
it
spasms
wildly
growling
in

the

strange
metalelectronic
plate

halting
