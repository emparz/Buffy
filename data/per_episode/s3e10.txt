1838
it's
christmastime
and
there
is
snow
on
the
ground
the
people
in
the
streets
are
all
dressed
in
warm
cloaks
a
carriage
goes
by
behind
it
a
very
worriedlooking
young
man
hurries
along
the
street
he
constantly
looks
back
to
see
if
he's
being
followed
he
passes
a
choir
group
singing
silent
night
but
pays
them
no
mind
in
a
more
crowded
area
he
pushes
his
way
through
the
people
eliciting
a
few
comments
on
his
rudeness
suddenly
a
pair
of
arms
reach
out
from
an
alleyway
pull
him
in
and
throw
him
to
the
snowcovered
cobblestones
he
looks
up
to
see
who
his
aggressor
is
and
finds
angelus
standing
over
him
sporting
his
game
face
daniel
where
were
you
going
daniel
afraid
you
you're
not
human
angelus
agreeably
not
of
late
no
daniel
begs
whwhat
do
you
want
well
it
happens
that
i'm
hungry
daniel
and
seeing
as
that
you're
somewhat
in
me
debt
daniel
frightened
please
i
can't
a
man
playing
at
cards
should
have
a
natural
intelligence
or
a
great
deal
of
money
and
you're
sadly
lacking
in
both
daniel
tries
to
get
up
and
flee
but
angelus
grabs
him
by
the
coat
and
roars
so
i
take
me
winnings
me
own
way
daniel
looking
up
terrified
the
lord
is
my
shepherd
i
shall
not
want
he
maketh
me
to
lie
down
in
green
pastures
angelus
interrupts
daniel
be
of
good
cheer
it's
christmas
he
bites
him
violently
on
the
neck
cut
to
angel's
bedroom
he
wakes
from
his
dream
with
a
start
and
after
realizing
it
was
only
a
dream
he
sits
up
in
bed
cut
to
a
sunnydale
shopping
district
in
the
window
of
an
audiovideo
store
a
tv
is
tuned
to
the
weather
it's
going
to
be
sunny
and
warm
with
temperatures
continuing
in
the
high
70s
weatherman
about
25c
throughout
the
holiday
weekend
just
a
little
warm
to
light
the
yule
log
but
it
should
make
for
a
very
nice
christmas
angel
walks
past
the
shop
window
at
a
brisk
pace
and
crosses
the
street
somewhere
on
the
block
is
a
group
of
carolers
singing
god
rest
ye
merry
gentlemen
angel
passes
a
santa
claus
ringing
a
bell
and
collecting
for
the
salvation
army
a
passerby
drops
some
coins
into
his
pot
merry
christmas
angel
stops
short
when
he
unexpectedly
runs
into
buffy
they
are
both
surprised
and
don't
say
anything
for
a
moment
angel
breaks
the
silence
hi
angel
another
awkward
silence
sets
in
for
a
while
so
are
you
shopping
buffy
realizes
how
silly
that
sounds
you're
probably
not
shopping
i
couldn't
sleep
vampires
probably
not
that
big
on
christmas
now
that
i
think
about
it
not
as
a
rule
but
you're
good
i'm
i'm
alright
you
yeah
buffy
smiles
yeah
i'm
good
i
um
buffy
looks
down
at
the
boxes
she's
carrying
i
was
just
getting
some
christmas
gifts
for
the
gang
angel's
attention
is
diverted
to
behind
buffy
in
the
middle
of
the
street
he
sees
an
apparition
of
daniel
looking
sadly
back
at
him
um
i'd
better
go
before
the
magic
store
closes
angel
and
daniel
exchange
a
long
look
then
daniel
walks
away
buffy
notices
angel's
distraction
angel
she
looks
behind
herself
and
sees
nothing
then
turns
her
concerned
attention
back
to
angel
what
is
it
angel
is
frozen
with
fear
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part

sunnydale
high
school
the
bell
rings
and
students
begin
to
pour
out
of
the
classrooms
into
the
halls
buffy
willow
and
xander
come
out
of
one
and
head
over
to
the
girls'
lockers
and
then
he
just
bailed
he
didn't
say
anything
he
just
took
off
it
was
so
weird
the
girls
both
work
their
locker
combinations
angel
weird
what
are
the
odds
xander
gets
a
look
from
buffy
do
you
think
something's
wrong
maybe
you
should
tell
giles
they
both
open
their
lockers
and
get
what
they
need
no
i
don't
wanna
bug
giles
he's
still
kinda
twitchy
when
it
comes
to
the
subject
of
angel
she
takes
off
her
jacket
and
hangs
it
in
her
locker
well
it
must
be
that
whole
angelkilledhisgirlfriendand
torturedhim
thing
hey
giles
is
pretty
petty
when
it
comes
to
stuff
like
that
buffy
takes
a
paper
bag
from
her
locker
and
then
closes
the
door
xander
enough
okay
willow
zips
up
her
book
bag
and
closes
her
locker
as
well
they
all
start
down
the
hall
maybe
angel
just
has
the
holiday
blues
everybody
gets
'em
especially
when
they're
alone
it's
just
so
frustrating
i'm
trying
to
do
the
right
thing
and
stay
away
from
him
and
get
over
it
and
then
boom
there
he
is
i
just
want
a
nice
quiet
christmas
vacation
cut
to
the
student
lounge
a
christmas
tree
is
set
up
there
the
gang
comes
out
of
an
adjacent
hall
and
heads
into
the
lounge
so

planned
but
i
guess
that's
off
cordelia
is
sitting
on
one
of
the
couches
with
a
friend
xander
is
instantly
nervous
buffy
takes
her
bag
over
to
the
holiday
food
drive
collection
box
behind
the
couches
and
starts
pulling
cans
of
food
out
of
her
bag
and
putting
them
in
the
box
willow
and
xander
sit
on
the
couch
opposite
cordelia
xander
with
false
heartiness
well
i'll
be
enjoying
my
annual
christmas
eve
campout
see
i
take
my
sleeping
bag
outside
and
i
go
to
sleep
on
the
grass
cordelia
and
her
friend
stand
up
her
friend
steps
over
to
the
stairs
and
waits
while
cordelia
hangs
around
to
add
her
point
of
view
sounds
fun
yeah
i
like
to
look
at
the
stars
you
know
feel
the
whole
nature
vibe
cordelia
smiling
smugly
i
thought
you
slept
outside
to
avoid
your
family's
drunken
christmas
fights
xander
gives
her
a
look
like
he
expected
no
less
from
her
yes
and
that
was
a
confidence
i
was
hoping
you
would
share
with
everyone
xander
smiles
sarcastically
buffy
joins
the
group
again
well
i'll
be
in
aspen
skiing
with
actual
snow
i
hear
that
helps
it
must
be
a
drag
to
be
stuck
here
in
sweatydale
but
i'm
thinking
of
you
okay
i'm
done
she
leaves
wearing
a
shark
smile
wellsatisfied
with
her
results
she
certainly
has
reverted
to
form
it's
not
her
fault
mm
after
what
happened
we
gotta
cut
her
some
slack
that's
the
christmas
spirit
hello
still
jewish
chanukah
spirit
i
believe
that
was
anyway
forgiveness
is
pretty
much
a
big
theme
with
me
this
year
'cause
of
the
she
stops
when
she
sees
oz
come
up
to
the
group
oz
glances
over
at
xander
who
is
suddenly
quite
uncomfortable
oz
turns
his
attention
to
willow
hey
hey
willow
looks
at
him
hopefully
cut
to
an
empty
classroom
willow
sits
on
one
end
of
the
teacher's
desk
while
oz
leans
against
the
other
and
looks
blankly
out
into
the
room
okay
the
thing
is
seeing
you
with
xander
it
was
well
i
never
felt
that
way
before
when
it
wasn't
a
full
moon
but
i
know
you
guys
have
a
history
but
it's
a
history
that's
in
the
past
well
ii
guess
most
history
is
in
the
past
but
it's
over
well
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
that
it
ever
will
be
between
you
two
willow
imploringly
oz
please
believe
me
oz
looks
at
her
this
is
what
i
do
know
i
miss
you
like
every
second
almost
like
i
lost
an
arm
or
worse
a
torso
so
i
think
i'd
be
willing
to
give
it
a
shot
willow
stands
up
and
smiles
tentatively
really
oz
stands
up
and
smiles
yeah
willow
smiles
more
warmly
do
you
want
us
to
to
hug
now
willow
looks
at
him
hopefully
oz
smiles
yeah
i'm
good
for
that
they
step
closer
to
each
other
and
hug
tightly
oz
with
one
arm
around
her
back
and
the
other
gently
caressing
her
head
while
willow
holds
onto
him
as
tightly
as
she
can
enfolding
him
in
her
arms
cut
to
a
christmas
tree
lot
buffy
and
her
mother
walk
through
trying
to
find
the
right
one
other
shoppers

also
selecting
trees

then
off
to
one
side

snowed
trees

christmasy
they
continue
through
the
tree
lot
i
think
those

was
thinking
maybe

should
invite
faith
to
spend
christmas
eve

faith
and
i
don't
really
hang
out

eve
all
by
herself
in
that
dingy
little
motel
room
buffy

and
see
he
doesn't
wanna
spend
christmas
eve
with
a
bunch
of
girls
joyce
takes
a
deep
breath
let's
split
up
she
goes
off
to
her
right
buffy
sighs
and
continues
looking
she
notices
an
area
where
a
bunch
of
the
trees
are
all
brown
and
walks
over
to
them
for
a
closer
look
the
tree
merchant
comes
up
to
her
bunch
of
them
up
and
died
on
us

why

a
hell
of
a
deal
no
thank

joyce
from
a
distance
oh
honey
this
one's
perfect
buffy
goes
to
see
what
her
mother
has
found
cut
to
another
dream
sequence
images
of
a
fire
and
burning
candles
float
around
the
image
of
a
round
table
with
candles
at
its
center
and
ritualistic
artifacts
arranged
to
form
three
spokes
upon
it
all
surrounded
by
a
circle
appears
three
chanting
figures
are
sitting
round
the
table
their
palms
placed
flat
upon
the
table's
rim
as
if
using
a
ouija
board
the
table
and
figures
float
by
several
times
suddenly
the
view
angles
up
from
the
table
and
into
the
face
of
one
of
the
three
figures
it
has
no
eyes
but
instead
has
runes
branded
in
the
flesh
where
eyes
should
be
cut
to
angel's
bedroom
he
wakes
with
a
gasp
frightened
and
breathing
hard
again
he
realizes
it's
only
a
dream
and
rubs
his
head
with
his
hands
cut
to
faith's
motel
cut
inside
her
room
she's
struggling
with
the
tv
slapping
and
shaking
it
to
try
to
get
some
reception
but
gets
nothing
there
is
a
knock
at
her
door
yeah
buffy
opens
the
door
and
comes
in
hey
what's
up
faith
to
the
tv
work
damn
it
buffy
closes
the
door
hey
faith
gives
up
and
turns
off
the
tv
she
stands
up
and
faces
buffy
what's
going
on
scary
monsters
no
um
buffy
steps
further
in
we're
having
christmas
eve
dinner
at
my
house
and
i
thought
that
um
if
you
didn't
have
plans
faith
smiles
sharply
your
mom
sent
you
down
huh
buffy
taken
aback
no
well
thanks
but
i
got
plans
there's
this
big
party
i've
been
invited
to
it
should
be
a
blast
faith
smiles
evasively
buffy
unconvinced
okay
cool
but
if
you
change
your
mind
the
offer
that's
nice
of
you
thanks
but
i
got
i
got
that
big
party
that
i've
been
invited
to
so
faith
smiles
dismayingly
buffy
steps
toward
the
door
but
looks
around
and
notices
the
christmas
lights
that
faith
has
strung
up
around
the
room
buffy
quietly
approving
i
like
the
lights
yeah
well
'tis
the
season
whatever
that
means
cut
to
giles'
kitchen
he's
cooking
dinner
and
takes
a
taste
there's
a
knocking
at
his
door
just
a
minute
he
goes
to
the
door
opens
it
and
is
surprised
to
see
angel
standing
there
for
a
long
moment
neither
of
them
says
anything
hello
um
i'm
sorry
to
bother
you
giles
finds
himself
unable
to
keep
from
laughing
bitterly
sorry
coming
from
you
that
phrase
strikes
me
as
rather
funny
'sorry
to
bother
me'
angel
i
need
your
help
giles
straightfaced
and
the
funny
keeps
on
coming
angel
swallowing
his
pride
i
understand
i
have
no
right
to
ask
for
it
but
there's
no
one
else
alright
he
walks
back
into
the
apartment
and
tosses
his
kitchen
towel
onto
the
counter
he
heads
down
the
hall
i
i
can't
come
in
unless
you
invite
me
giles
returns
from
the
hall
holding
a
crossbow
and
raising
it
at
the
ready
i'm
aware
of
that
he
walks
back
to
the
door
come
in
slowly
and
not
without
reservation
angel
steps
into
the
apartment
giles'
aim
does
not
waver
i've
been
seeing
angel
distracted
i've
i've
had
dreams
lately
about
the
past
it's
it's
like
i'm
living
it
again
it's
it's
so
vivid
i
i
need
to
know
angel
pleading
i
need
to
know
why
i'm
here
here
back
on
earth
i
should
be
in
a
demon
dimension
suffering
an
eternity
of
torture
i
don't
feel
particularly
inclined
to
argue
with
that
but
i'm
not
i
was
freed
and
i
don't
understand
why
knowing
why
you
were
back
would
give
you
peace
of
mind
it
might
giles
decides
it's
probably
okay
to
put
down
his
weapon
and
bends
to
his
side
to
set
the
crossbow
down
behind
him
angel
sees
an
apparition
of
jenny

think
that's
something
you
ought
to
have
jenny
looks
at

begins
to
shiver
with
fear
because
sir

be
blunt
the
last
time
you
became
complacent
about
your
existence
turned
out
rather
badly
angel
sees
jenny
stroke
her
hand
down
giles'
shoulder
and
sigh
giles
doesn't
notice
a
thing
angel
begins
to
pant
with
short
rapid
breaths
giles
notices
the
look
of
fear
on
his
face
focused
behind
him
what
he
looks
around
his
apartment
completely
unaware
of
jenny's
presence
don't
you
see
her
he
sees
jenny
walk
around
giles
who
angel
begins
to
make
his
way

grabs

roughly
and
bites
her
he
drinks
her
dry
and
lets

is
shocked
to

deed

stares
back
at
him

in

with
a
sudden
jerk
and
gasps
cut
to
buffy's

with
a
startled
twist
of
her
head
and
stares
into
the
darkness
of
her

coldly
appraising
eyes

steady
gaze

both
doing
guest
spots

pathetic
a
social
life
willow
walks
in
smiling

of

all
at
the
center
table
doing
research
giles
drops
off
a
few
more
books
for
them
to
look
through
dissolve
to
them
having
a
discussion
using
the
whiteboard
dissolve
to
xander
arriving
with
a
pizza
and
dropping
it
on
the
table
dissolve
to
more
researching
with
the
pizza
halfeaten
dissolve
to
later
with
just
willow
and
buffy
at
the
table
he's
gonna
come
over
on
christmas
eve
'cause
my
parents
are
out
of

we're
gonna
watch
videos
that's
good
right
buffy
they
exchange
a
look
you
guys
are
back
it's
good
it's
perfect
in
an
awkward
uncomfortable
sort
of
way
willow
buffy
gives
her
a
sympathetic
look
i
just
don't
know
how
to
make
oz
trust
me
xander
has
a
piece
of
you
that
oz
just
can't
touch
i
guess
now
it's
just
about
showing
oz
that
he
comes
first
willow
considers
that
i
guess
thanks
willow
reads
hey
he
likes
beets
i
read
that
one
already
buffy
sighs
we're
not
getting
any
closer
cut
to
angel's
mansion
he
falls
to
the
floor
clammy
shivering
and
panting
in
horror
another
one
of
his
victims
a
businessman
paces
past
him
the
thing
i
remember
most
was
thinking
how
artful
it
was
in
the
dark
they
looked
just
like
they
were
sleeping
it
wasn't
until
i
bent
down
and
kissed
them
good
night
that
i
felt
how
cold
they
were
you
grabbed
me
and
i
thought
businessman
faces
angel
who
would
go
to
so
much
trouble
to
arrange
them
like
that
angel
looks
up
at
him
the
businessman
crouches
and
transforms
into
margaret
but
you
see
that's
what
makes
you
different
than
other
beasts
they
kill
to
feed
but
you
took
more
kinds
of
pleasure
in
it
than
any
creature
that
walks
or
crawls
oh
god
margaret
mocking
him
yeah
cry
out
make
a
scene
angel
jumps
to
his
feet
and
tries
to
run
away
but
finds
daniel
standing
in
his
way

to
flash
back
to
the
days
before
he
became
a
vampire
in
a
bar
singing
and
drinking
pulling
at
a
woman's
dress
before
passing
out
and
falling
to
the
floor
the
flashback
is
over
and
margaret
is
standing
before

drunken
whoring
layabout

terrible
disappointment
to
your
parents

a
chance
to
to
die
of
syphilis
you
were
a
worthless
being
before

can't
take
much
more
and
he
holds
his
hands
to
his
ears

puts
her
hands
on
his
gently

sharing
a
dream

is
lying
in
her
bed
and
she
slowly
opens
her
eyes

is
sitting
at
her
side
looking
down
at
her
waiting
for
her
to
awaken

reaches
for
buffy's
hand
with
his
they
touch
fingertips
briefly
before
intertwining
their
fingers
and
clasping
hands

buffy
is
facing
angel
sitting
on
his
lap
with
her
legs
circling
round
his
waist
they
are
kissing
passionately
holding
each
other
as
closely
as
possible
caressing
each
other
tenderly
buffy
tugs
at

shirt
and
he
helps
her
pull

up
and
off
baring
his
chest
in
the
real
world

turns
again
on

it
is
angel's
turn
to
slip
the
satin
pajama

hold
each
other
tightly
as
they
kiss
longer
and
more
intensely
in

world
buffy
moans
and
turns
her
head
while
lying
on
the
library
floor
buffy
and
angel
are
lying
in
bed
together
making
gentle
passionate
love

change
positions
as
angel
rolls
on

of
her
the
muscles
of
his
back
flexing
under
his
tattoo
they
caress
each
other
for
several
moments
angel
tenderly
kisses
buffy
where
her
neck
joins
her
shoulder
and
he
slides
his
hand
up
and
along
her
outstretched
arm
reaching
and
clasping
her
hand
as
they
continue
making
love
suddenly
over
angel's
shoulder
buffy
sees
the
eyeless
priest
from
her
previous
dream
sightlessly
observing
them
from
where
he's
standing
at
her
door
there
are
several
sudden
flashes
of
light
angel
removes
his
hands
from
their
tender
clasp
and
then
as
a
thunderclap
is
heard
grabs
buffy's
wrists
hard
forcibly
pinning
her
down
to
the
bed
he
rises
over
her
and
transforms
into
his
vampire
guise
and

savagely
on
the
neck
cut
to
the
library
buffy
wakes
in
startled
shock

still
sitting
next
to
him

the
underground

a
lot
of
migration
out
of
sunnydale
from
the
lower

something's
scaring
them
off

million
square
miles
of
sewer
plus
a

of
natural
cave
formations

mind
he
grabs
his
hair
with
his
hands
in
desperation
buffy
imploringly
angel
how

he
runs
toward
her
window
and
dives
out
buffy
is
in
shock
over
it
all
cut
downstairs
buffy
hurriedly
talks
with
faith
as

no
response
to
that
buffy
voice
faltering
i
think

losing
him
look
giles
puts
on
his
glasses
you
realize
if
he
truly
becomes
a
danger
you
may
have
to
kill
him
again
can
you
do
that
buffy
can't
bring
herself
to
answer
cut
to
the
atrium
at
angel's
mansion
he
tries
to
get
away
from
jenny
and
goes
into
the
mansion
i

do
it
you
have
to
do
it
jenny
tauntingly
what

panting
hard
get
away
from
me
jenny
appears
behind
him
couldn't
you
just
feel
her
jenny
leans
close
to
him
couldn't
you
almost
smell
her
skin
you
never
were
a
fighter
angel
don't
start
trying
now
jenny
steps
away
sooner
or
later
you
will
drink
her
i'll
never
hurt
her
you
were
born
to
hurt
her
jenny
scornfully
have
you
learned
nothing
as
long
as
you
are
alive
angel
flatly
then
i'll
die
jenny
pauses
to
consider
you
don't
have
the
strength
to
kill
yourself
i
don't
need
strength
i
just
need
the
sun
to
rise
he
walks
back
out
into
the
atrium
you're
not
supposed
to
die
this
isn't
the
plan
she
watches
him
walk
through
the
atrium
and
take
the
steps
up
and
out
but
it'll
do
part
4

giles'
apartment
buffy
reads
aloud
from
a
book
behind
her
giles
sits
on
the
stairs
and
reads
to
himself
from
another
'a
child
shall
be
born
of
man
and
goat
and
have
two
heads
and
the
first
shall
speak
only
in
riddles'
no
wonder
you
like
this
stuff
buffy
closes
the
book
it's
like
reading
the
sun
giles
finds
something
yes
ah
buffy
looks
up
at
him
priests
um
yes
but
uh
more
more
posturing
i'm
afraid
um
giles
reads
'for
they
are
the
harbingers
of
death
nothing
shall
grow
above
or
below
them
no
seed
shall
flower
neither
in
man
nor'
giles
gestures
that
it
goes
on
and
on
they're
rebels
and
they'll
never
ever
be
any
good
nothing
specific
about
their
haunts
let
me
see
that
giles
hands
her
the
book
buffy
reads
'the
harbingers
of
death
nothing
shall
grow
above
or
below'
she
is
suddenly
lost
in
thought
what
cut
to
the
christmas
tree
lot
buffy
kicks
open
the
gate
and
marches
straight
toward
the
dead
trees
once
there
she
studies
them
for
a
moment
the
camera
lifts
straight
up
looking
down
at
the
six
trees
that
have
died
arranged
in
a
circle
all
the
trees
around
them
are
fine
cut
to
buffy
at
ground
level
she
looks
around
for
something
to
dig
with
and
finds
a
longhandled
ax
she
swings
it
at
the
ground
and
after
a
couple
of
hits
she
breaks
through
a
few
more
swings
and
the
hole
is
large
enough
for
her
to
get
through
she
crouches
down
and
drops
herself
into
it
cut
below
buffy
drops
down
into
a
cave
there
are
groups
of
candles
burning
here
and
there
she
cautiously
looks
around
and
starts
to
make
her
way
deeper
into
the
cave
she
can
hear
chanting
coming
from
nearby
she
doesn't
have
to
go
far
before
she
finds
the
table
with
the
priests
sitting
around
it
alright
ten
more
minutes
of
chanting
and
then
you
guys
have
to
go
to
bed
the
priests
get
up
and
buffy
jumps
down
to
fight
them
she
swings
the
handle
of
her
ax
into
one
priest's
stomach
and
he
goes
down
she
swings
it
into
another
one
who
doubles
over
she
follows
up
with
another
swing
to
his
head
and
he
goes
down
too
the
third
one
runs
away
buffy
uses
the
ax
to
destroy
the
arrangement
of
artifacts
on
the
table
the
next
thing
she
knows
jenny
is
in
the
cave
with
her
hmm
i'm
impressed
buffy
hesitates
at
first
surprised
to
see
jenny
there
but
quickly
realizes
that
it's
not
really
her
buffy
defiantly
you
won't
get
angel
hmm
you
think
you
can
fight
me
i'm
not
a
demon
little
girl
i
am
something
that
you
can't
even
conceive
the
first
evil
beyond
sin
beyond
death
i
am
the
thing
the
darkness
fears
you'll
never
see
me
but
i
am
everywhere
every
being
every
thought
every
drop
of
hate
buffy
loses
her
patience
alright
i
get
it
you're
evil
do
we
have
to
chat
about
it
all
day
the
first
jenny
unimpressed
angel
will
be
dead
by
sunrise
your
christmas
will
be
his
wake
no
you
have
no
idea
what
you're
dealing
with
buffy
dripping
with
sarcasm
lemme
guess
is
it
evil
the
apparition
of
jenny
shrinks
and
is
replaced
for
an
instant
by
an
image
of
a
huge
horned
and
clawed
beast
coming
at
her
roaring
and
with
eyes
glowing
red
it
fades
as
quickly
as
it
appeared
buffy
stares
in
shock
at
the
place
where
it
appeared
it
screams
a
final
warning
dead
by
sunrise
buffy
runs
from
the
cave
terrified
for
angel's
life
cut
to
angel's
mansion
buffy
runs
in
angel
she
looks
around
but
he's
nowhere
to
be
seen
she
walks
toward
the
doorway
to
the
atrium
and
looks
out
she
sees
the
steps
leading
up
and
runs
toward
them
cut
to
the
hills
behind
the
mansion
buffy
runs
through
the
bushes
frantically
looking
for
angel
she
climbs
further
up
the
hill
and
finds
him
standing
at
the
top
looking
out
over
a
peaceful
residential
area
of
town
angel
he
hears
her
say
his
name
and
briefly
glances
in
her
direction
before
looking
back
out
over
the
rooftops
buffy
slowly
walks
over
to
him
i
bet
half
the
kids
down
there
are
already
awake
lying
in
their
beds
sneaking
downstairs
waiting
for
day
buffy
out
of
breath
angel
please
i
need
for
you
to
get
inside
th
there's
only
a
few
minutes
left
i
know
i
can
smell
the
sunrise
long
before
it
comes
buffy
anxiously
and
hurried
i
don't
have
time
to
explain
this
you
just
have
to
trust
me
that
thing
that
was
haunting
you
angel
interrupts
it
wasn't
haunting
me
it
was
showing
me
buffy
confused
showing
you
what
i
am
buffy
insistently
were
and
ever
shall
be
i
wanted
to
know
why
i
was
back
now
i
do
you
don't
know
some
great
evil
takes
credit
for
bringing
you
back
and
you
buy
it
you
just
give
up
angel
harshly
i
can't
do
it
again
buffy
i
can't
become
a
killer
then
fight
it
it's
too
hard
buffy
desperately
angel
please
you
have
to
get
inside
it
told
me
to
kill
you
you
were
in
the
dream
you
know
it
told
me
to
lose
my
soul
in
you
and
become
a
monster
again
i
know
what
it
told
you
what
does
it
matter
angel
raises
his
voice
because
i
wanted
to
because
i
want
you
so
badly
i
want
to
take
comfort
in
you
and
i
know
it'll
cost
me
my
soul
and
a
part
of
me
doesn't
care
he
sobs
buffy
is
at
a
loss
for
words
look
i'm
weak
i've
never
been
anything
else
it's
not
the
demon
in
me
that
needs
killing
buffy
it's
the
man
you're
weak
everybody
is
everybody
fails
maybe
this
evil
did
bring
you
back
but
if
it
did
it's
because
it
needs
you
and
that
means
that
you
can
hurt
it
angel
doesn't
want
to
believe
her
buffy
pleadingly
angel
you
have
the
power
to
do
real
good
to
make
amends
buffy
raises
her
voice
but
if
you
die
now
then
all
that
you
ever
were
was
a
monster
she
looks
out
at
the
sky
as
it
begins
to
lighten
buffy
begging
frantically
angel
please
the
sun
is
coming
up
just
go
i
won't
what
do
you
think
this
is
simple
you
think
there's
an
easy
answer
you
can
never
understand
what
i've
done
now
go
you
are
not
staying
here
buffy
grabs
his
arm
i
won't
let
you
i
said
leave
he
jerks
his
arm
free
of
her
grasp
in
her
anger
and
desperation
buffy
punches
him
he
reacts
by
shoving
her
away
from
him
roughly
making
her
fall
face
forward
hard
to
the
ground
angel
quietly
to
himself
oh
my
god
he
goes
to
her
and
crouches
over
her
grabbing
her
by
the
shoulders
and
turning
her
around
to
face
him
buffy
fears
his
intentions
and
cries
out
no
no
he
grabs
her
roughly
by
the
arms
and
holds
her
firmly
am
i
a
thing
worth
saving
huh
angel
shakes
her
am
i
a
righteous
man
angel
shakes
her
the
world
wants
me
gone
buffy
tearfully
what
about
me
i
love
you
so
much
and
i
tried
to
make
you
go
away
i
killed
you
and
it
didn't
help
she
shoves
him
off
of
her
and
gets
up
buffy
crying
and
i
hate
it
i
hate
that
it's
so
hard
and
that
you
can
hurt
me
so
much
buffy
sobs
then
harshly
i
know
everything
that
you
did
because
you
did
it
to
me
oh
god
i
wish
that
i
wished
you
dead
i
don't
buffy
whispers
i
can't
angel
gets
up
now
too
buffy
please
just
this
once
let
me
be
strong
strong
is
fighting
it's
hard
and
it's
painful
and
it's
every
day
it's
what
we
have
to
do
and
we
can
do
it
together
angel
struggles
with
himself
knowing
she's
right
buffy
resolvedly
but
if
you're
too
much
of
a
coward
for
that
then
burn
if
i
can't
convince
you
that
you
belong
in
this
world
then
i
don't
know
what
can
but
do
not
expect
me
to
watch
and
don't
expect
me
to
mourn
for
you
because
she
stops
in
midsentence
because
it
has
inexplicably
begun
to
snow
she
and
angel
both
look
up
at
it
coming
down
lightly
at
first
and
gradually
heavier
the
camera
pulls
up
above
them
and
shows
them
standing
there
with
the
snowflakes
swirling
around
them
in
the
gentle
morning
breeze
and
the
ground
around
them
starting
to
become
white
cut
to
angel
looking
around
in
amazement
buffy
walks
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
looks
out
at
the
town
as
the
roofs
on
the
houses
below
also
start
to
become
white
she
turns
to
angel
and
they
look
at
each
other
stunned
by
this
apparent
miracle
cut
to
willow
and
oz
in
her
bedroom
they
notice
the
snow
outside
and
sit
up
on
her
bed
willow
is
first
to
get
up
and
walk
to
her
balcony
door
to
look
out
oz
is
right
behind
they
smile
as
they
see
it
come
down
and
notice
the
glass
of
her
french
doors
begin
to
frost
cut
to
the
summers
house
about
an
inch
and
a
half
4cm
of
snow
has
now
collected
on
the
roof
the
camera
pans
down
to
the
door
faith
opens
it
and
she
and
joyce
come
out
to
watch
it
fall
faith
steps
off
the
porch
and
lets
a
few
flakes
fall
on
her
open
hands
and
face
joyce
pulls
her
wrap
tightly
around
her
against
the
cold
cut
to
giles'
apartment
he
notices
that
his
window
has
become
frosted
and
goes
over
to
it
to
have
a
look
outside
he
stares
out
in
amazement
cut
to
xander
lying
in
his
sleeping
bag
in
his
backyard
the
light
from
his
lantern
glows
blue
his
unfinished
dinner
plate
is
covered
with
snow
as
is
a
comic
book
he
had
put
aside
before
retiring
he
is
sleeping
with
the
top
flap
of
his
sleeping
bag
folded
open
under
his
arm
he
stirs
slightly
and
wipes
at
the
snowflakes
falling
on
his
face
that
doesn't
help
so
he
reflexively
pulls
the
flap
closed
over
his
head
fallen
snow
and
all
this
wakes
him
up
and
a
moment
later
he
pushes
back
the
flap
and
looks
up
in
wonder
at
the
falling
snow
cut
to
the
shopping
district
the
camera
pans
from
the
green
neon
sign
of
the
sun
cinema
down
to
where
the
movies
now
playing
are
listed
the
weatherman
can
be
heard
on
the
tv
in
the
window
of
the
audiovideo
store
and
while
most
of
southern
california
is
enjoying
a
balmy
christmas
an
extreme
cold
front
has
sprung
up
out
of
nowhere
around
sunnydale
where
they
are
reporting
heavy
snowfall
for
the
first
time
in
well
ever
cut
to
the
weatherman
on
tv
the
camera
pans
from
him
out
into
the
street
sunnydale
residents
shouldn't
expect
to
see
the
sun
at
all
today
that
cold
front
isn't
going
anywhere
with
temperatures
in
the
high
30s
weatherman
about
3c
means
you
better
bundle
up
if
you're
planning
to
go
outside
and
enjoy
the
change
in
the
weather
cut
to
a
view
of
the
trees
in
the
street
aglow
with
christmas
lights
the
camera
pans
down
into
the
street
which
is
deserted
except
for
buffy
and
angel
who
walk
along
handinhand
still
looking
up
at
the
snow
as
it
comes
down
cut
to
a
view
from
above
the
street
and
a
few
parked
cars
are
covered
with
about
two
inches
5cm
of
snow
the
camera
sinks
down
below
a
traffic
light
buffy
and
angel
continue
walking
in
silence
down
the
street
cut
to
a
closeup
of
them
walking
buffy
looks
over
at
angel
he
looks
exhausted
but
at
peace
he
notices
her
gaze
and
smiles
at
her
together
they
walk
out
of
