standing
behind
her
with
his
arms
crossed
they
are
both
facing
the
same
direction
this
may
mean
more
than
you
think
is
that
so
show
that
principal
wood
and
buffy
are
talking
to
two
young
boys
who
have
bruises
and
ripped
shirts
because
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
a
couple
of
chuckleheads
who
thought
that
a
cafeteria
fist
fight
would
impress
i'm
not
impressed
buffy
are
you
impressed
principal

buffy
purses
her
lips
and
shakes
her

disapprovingly

the

its
semiannual
percolation
usually
it
blows
around
may
was
it
like
this
before
i
mean
it
just
seems
to
me
as
if
things
are
getting
bad
faster
than
we
thought
we're
a
little
ahead
of
schedule
i
can't
say
i'm
too
surprised

mother
died
i
guess
i
just
couldn't
part
with
it
wow
i
don't
know
what's
inside
exactly
but
i
know
it
has
something
to
do

be
better
if

did
how's

just—the
first

of
fighters
with
nothing
to
hit
a
wicca
who
won'ta
and
the
brains
of
our
operation
wears
oven

takes
guts
this
isn't
your
full
arsenal
anyway

the
vampire
cut

25
int

at
buffy's

go
after
saving
your
life
for
now
that
was
one
of
d'hoffryn's
killers
spike
he
won't
stop
coming
'til

annoying
but
you
fought
like

a
wimpire

lifting
and
the
running
why
not
just
kill
him
buffy
and
principal

anya
thinks
starts
to
speak
rolls
her
eyes
we
both
know
the
safest
and
sanest
way
of
saving
your
life
was
to
keep
you
with
me
away
from
danger
spike
anya
grunts
shakes
her
head
and
walks
away
no
need
to
thank
me
i'm
just
the
one
who
beat
him
off
spike
looks
at
buffy
repelled
him
would
perhaps
be
the
better
phrase
spike
buffy
nods
demon
figured
principal
wood
from
across
the
room
not
facing
spike
i
hope
we're
not
intruding
not
a
bit
and
just
what
brings
our
good
principal
to
this
neck
of
the
gloom
i'm
showing
him
our
operation

fine
by
me
spike
nods
big
fight
against

coming
up

more
good

got
the
longer
we'll
all

wood
still
not
facing

that
what

are
a
good
guy
spike
turns
from
buffy
toward
wood
i
haven't
heard
any
complaints
well
i
have
heard
a
few
complaints
over
the
years
but
then
i
just
killed
whoever
spoke
up
and
that
was
pretty
much
that
spike
woods
turns
to
face
spike
he's
joking
principal
wood
glaring
at
spike
no
he's
not
spike
looking
at
wood
no
i'm
not
spike
softly
butthat's
the
old
me
i'm
talking
about
why
don't
you
tell
me
about
that
not
much
to
tell
i've
changed
oh
now
that
you
have
a
soul
principal
wood
nods
yeah
that
was
a
big
deal
very
private
spike
hurt
to
buffy
what
are
you
just
telling
everyone
now
oh
come
on
spike
don't
blame
buffy
i
asked
principal
wood
walks
toward
spike
spike
walks
toward
wood
right
the
educator
spike
facing
each
other
now
only
a
few
feet
apart
yeah
i
went
to
great
lengths
lots
of
trouble
and
now
i'm
unique
well
more
or
less
got
myself
a
soul
whatever
that
means
and
how's
that
working
out
for
you
in
progress
well
you've
had
some
time
you've
been
in
sunnydale
what
years
how
many
a
few
before
that
around
spike
spike's
gritting
his
teeth
huffing
pursing
his
lips
as
wood
needles
him
buffy
stepping
up
nearly
in
between
them
i
think
we'd
better
get
back
upstairs
spike
staring
at
wood
talking
cockily
in
his
face
right
give
him
the
full
tour
you
don't
want
to
miss
a
look
at
her
weapons'
chest
buffy
walks
upstairs
wood
follows
cut
to
25
int
upstairs
at
buffy's
house
day
buffy's
setting
up
sleeping
bags
and
pillows
in
dawn's
room
while
talking
to
dawn
so
i
took
a
look
inside
that
emergency
bag
of
principal
wood's
and
smelled
weird
kinda
like
grandma's
closet
but
worse
i
didn't
know
what
was
possible
anything
we
could
use
trinkets
weapons
one
very
large
textbook
dawn
picks
up
the
book
flips
through
it
translation's
gonna
be
a
bitch
but
do
you
know
that
ancient
sumerians
do
not
speak
english
buffy
scoffs
they're
worse
than
the
french
anything
else
uh
yeah
a
box
a
big
fat
unopenable
box
i'm
betting
whatever
the
big
deal
about
this
emergency
bag
is
you'll
find
it
in
the

it's
laughing
you

to
surprise
the
enemy
surprise
yourselves
force
yourself
to
do
what
can't
be
done
or
else
we
are
not
an
army—we're
just
a
bunch
of
girls
waiting
to
be
picked
off
and
buried
buffy
spike
stands
and
walks
toward
the
door
where
are
you
going
out
since
i'm
neither
a
girl
nor
waiting
all
this
speechifying
doesn't
really
apply
to
me
does
it
spike
walks
away
buffy
calls
after
him
fine
take
a
cell
phone
that
way
if
i
need
someone
to
get
weepy
or
whaled
on
i
can
call
you
spike
turns
to
buffy
if
you've
got
something
to
say—
just
said
it
you
keep
holding
back
you
might
as
well
walk
out
that
door
holding
back
you're
blind
i've
been
here
right
in
it—fighting
scrapping
since
you
got
your
soul
back
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
haven't
quite
been
relishing
the
kill
the
way
i
used
to
you
were
a
better
fighter
then
i
did
this
for
you
the
soul
the
changes—it's
what
you
wanted
what
i
want
is
the
spike
that's
dangerous
the
spike
that
tried
to
kill
me
when
we
met
spike
angrily
oh
you
don't
know
how
close
you
are
to
bringing
him
out
i'm
nowhere
near
him
dawn
get
the
potentials
upstairs
and
break
out
that
emergency
kit
what
are
you
gonna
do
i'm
declaring
an
emergency
buffy
walks
out
past
spike
without
acknowledging
him
cut
to
29
int
living
room
at
buffy's
house
night
principal
wood
sets
down
the
slayer's
emergency
kit
next
to
buffy
we
thought
you'd
want
to
be
here
yeah
you
thought
right
dawn
kennedy
willow
anya
and
xander
go
through
the
contents
of
the
bag
that
emergency
bag's
got
some
neat
stuff
in
it
weapons
charms
dawn
holds
up
the
book
advanced
reading
assignments
yeah
cool
stuff
but
we've
seen
it
all
before
anya
points
to
the
box
well
not
this
we
haven't
what's
inside
it
mm
i
don't
know
it
hasn't
been
opened
since—
principal
wood
buffy
breaks
off
the
lock
with
her
bare
hands
well
since
now
xander
pulls
out
metal
figures
from
the
bag
puppets
that's
it
the
first
hates
puppets
now
if
we
can
just
airlift
kermit
fozzie
the
bear
and
miss
piggy
into
town
the
first'll
be
arunning
those
are
muppets
dawn
takes
the
figure
from
xander
and
these
things
are
shadowcasters
you
put
them
in
motion
and
they
tell
you
a
story
dawn
references
the
book
it
says
you
can't
just
watch
you
have
to
see
what
the
hell
does
that
mean
it's
cryptic
i
don't
like
it
every
time
instructions
get
cryptic
someone
gets
hurt—usually
me
you
can't
just
watch
you
have
to
see
buffy
to
principal
wood
see
what
that's
where
all
my
fancy
translating
skills
break
down
but
i
think
it's
an
origin
myth
the
story
of
the
very
first
slayer
ii
saw
her
you
saw
the
first
slayer
the
other
night—in
my
dream
it's
gotta
mean
something
right
cut
to
30
int
living
room
at
buffy's
house
night
in
the
darkened
room
xander
strikes
a
match
and
lights
the
wick
at
the
center
of
a
metal
mechanical
object
the
light
fills
the
room
revealing
dawn
who's
holding
a
large
book
open
in
her
arms
ok
according
to
this
i
think—you
put
on
those
puppet
guys
one
by
one
they
cast
shadows
and
the
shadows
tell
the
story
first
there
is
the
earth
xander
puts
the
first
metal
figure
on
the
mechanical
object
the
light
at
the
center
casts
a
shadow
of
the
figure
on
the
wall
a
tribal
drumbeat
can
be
heard
in
the
background
what's
that
sound
ok
so
far
so
creepy
hmm
ok
as
dawn
narrates
the
story
xander
puts
the
corresponding
shadow
caster
figure
on
the
device

as
xander
adds
the
figures
to
the
shadow
caster
sounds
are
also
added
to
the
magical
soundtrack

then
there
came
the
demons
a
representation
of
a
demon
and
growling
sounds
after
demons
there
came
men
a
representation
of
men
and
chanting
sounds
men
found
a
girl
a
representation
of
a
girl
and
a
girl's
scream
and
the
men
took
the
girl
to
fight
the
demon—all
demons
they—they
chained
her
to
the
earth
a
representation
of
a
chain
and
then—and
i—i
can't
read
this
something
about
darkness
the
shadow
casting
device
starts
spinning
on
its
own
what
about
darkness
the
shadow
caster
device
is
spinning
making
shadows
of
the
figures
on
the
walls
but
the
shadows
are
animated
moving
acting
out
the
story
it
says
you
cannot
be
shown
you
cannot
just
watch
but
you
must
see
see
for
yourself
but
only
if
you're
willing
to
make
the
exchange
when
did
you
get
so
good
at
sumerian
it's
not
in
sumerian
anymore
dawn
the
words
on
the
pages
of
the
book
are
magically
changing
into
english
willow
and
kennedy
stand
alarmed
as
the
shadow
casters
tell
a
story
of
a
demon
attacking
the
chained
girl
the
device
spins
faster
and
faster
as
the
shadows
move
up
the
walls
suddenly
a
bright
blue
light
forms
at
the
center
of
the
device
growing
in
size
until
it
forms
a
window
of
light
buffy
walks
closer
to
investigate
it
but
what
does
it
mean
it
means
i
have
to
go
in
there
willow
panicky
no
it
doesn't
where

it

what
you're
exchanging

jumps
through
the
window
of
light
the
portal
closes
behind
her
she's
gone
huh
what
was
that
about
an
exchange
there's
a
flash
of
light
and
then
a
large
growling
demon
appears
ah

must
be
the
exchange

the
demon
grabs
xander

the
shirt

throws

thing
and
you
expect
to
reopen
the
portal
without
sending
willow
off
the
deep
end
willow
frowns
nods
thanks
for
your
support
well
it's
true
we're
going
to
have
to
find
another
way
willow
shakes
her
head
there
isn't
and
buffy
knew
it
i've
got
to
get
her
back
we
don't
even
know
where
she
went
cut
to
32
ext
desert
day
buffy
tumbles
through
the
portal
and
finds
herself
in
the
desert
it
looks
like
where
she
had
gone
once
before
with
giles
on
the
spiritual
retreat
the
lighting
is
strange
as
if
brightness
and
contrast
have
been
turned
superhigh
giving
the
scene
a
supernatural
feel
well
guess
that
worked
she
hears
chanting
nearby
and
goes
to
investigate
cut
to
33
int
downstairs
at
buffy's
house
night
dawn's
holding
the
book
from
the
slayer's
emergency
kit
willow
kennedy
and
xander
are
gathered
around
her
in
the
living
room
dawnie
what's
the
book
say
not
much
once
buffy
left
it
got
a
little
tougher
to
read
dawn
holds
up
the
book
to
show
the
writing
has
changed
oh
willow
walks
out
of
the
room
to
the
kitchen
the
others
follow
it's
ok
we'll
just
start
with
what
we
know
and
take
it
from
there
great
so
far
we
know
jack
about
squat
let's
go
from
there
you've
got
the
magic
use
it
iii
don't
even
know
what
magic
to
use
why
not
just
try
all
32
flavors
worst
thing
that
happens
is
you
go
brunette
willow
grabs
firstaid
kit
from
kitchen
cabinet
that's
not
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
willow
attends
to
kennedy's
wounded
hand
she's
right
and
you
know
we
have
a
choice
we
can
risk
willow's
life
and
the
rest
of
our
lives
to
get
buffy
back
or
we
leave
her
out
there
if
we
play
it
safe
back
here
buffy
could
stay
lost
you
missed
her
everyone
sucks
but
me
speech
if
she's
so
superior
let
her
find
her
own
way
back
anya
the
first
is
already
up
and
running
every
second
that
buffy's
not
here
is
an
opportunity
for
it
to
show
up
and
rip
us
to
pieces
willow
how
would
you
get
buffy
back
that's
what
i'm
saying—i
don't
even
know
ok
but
if
another
witch
was
to
do
it
where
would
she
start
uh
physics
principles
basic
laws
such
as
uh
conservation
of
energies
you
can't
really
create
or
destroy
anything
only
transfer
anya
scoffs
i'm
sorry
are
you
helping
no
but
at
least
i'm
not
galloping
off
in
the
wrong
direction
magic
works
off
physics
not
without
a
catalyst
if
you're
talking
about
transferring
energies
you
need
some
kind
of
conduit
like
aa
kraken's
tooth
yeah
skin
of
draconis
um
ground
up
baltic
stones
something
ok
good
plus
we
need
an
exchange
like
you
said
i'm
thinking
a
slayer
for
a
demon
right
if
we
want
buffy
back
then
we
have
to
find
that
demon
and
send
it
through
it
matter
if
it's
dead
or
alive
spike
standing
in
the
doorway
now
i
vote
dead
the
slayer's
counting
on
you
willow
get
cracking
on
that
portal
and
don't
be
stingy
with
the
mojo
the
demon's
mine
hate
to
say
it
kennedy
makes
quotes
with
her
hands
big
bad
but
you
look
like
you
can
barely
stand
we're
trained
and
the
only
thing
we
know
for
sure
about
this
demon
is
it
kicked
your
ass
spike
smirks
it
did
at
that
spike
walks

buffy
walks
up
to
a
group
of
three
men
dressed
in
tribal
fashion
each
holding
a
tall
staff
and
wearing
different
colored
headdresses
hello
i'm
buffy
i'm
the

the
men
are
speaking
some
unrecognizeable
language
subtitle
we
know
who
you
are
subtitle
and
we
know
why
you're
here
subtitle
we've
been
waiting
buffy
nods
good
that's
good
then
um
you
know
i
know
we
have
bigger
issues
to
deal
with
but
how'd
i
understand
anything
you
guys
just
said
buffy
they
look
at
each
other
and
stand
not
answering
oh
i
know
ancient
magicks
i
just
thought
it
was
neat
subtitle
red
hat
shadow
man
the
three
men
start
circling
buffy
we
have
been
here
since
the
beginning
subtitle
now
we
are
almost
at
the
end
the
neat
of
it
just
left
end
of
what
subtitle
you
are
the
hellmouth's
last
guardian
latest
you
mean
latest
guardian
subtitle
no
ok
um
i
have
a
first
to
fight
ok
so
just
tell
me
what
i
need
to
know
i
came
to
learn
subtitle
we
cannot
give
you
knowledge
only
power
you
know
what
i
think
i'm
not
really
here
at
all
none
of
this
is
actually
happening
this
is
like
a
play
like
some
shadowplay
some
nonreality
reenactment
hologramy—
one
of
the
men
hits
buffy
knocking
her
over—she
falls
to
the
ground
cut
to

int
living
room
at
buffy's
house
night
willow's
pouring
green
sand
from
a
bag
creating
a
circle
with
the
sand
kennedy
dawn
xander
and
anya
are
also
in
the
room
and
this
is
gonna
help
us
how
the
sand
forms
a
circle
the
circle
acts
as
a
barrier
and
the
barrier
contains
the
portal
now
what
we
hold
hands
and
chant
kumbaya
or
something
willow
hands
the
bag
of
sand
to
kennedy
maybe
'til
we
get
the
magicks
up
and
running
i'm
kinda
working
on
my
best
guess
here
will
maybe
we
should
wait
for
what
spike—to
see
if
he
can
bring
back
that
demon
no
i
don't
think
we
should
wait
right
now
opening
a
portal
this
size
could
take
days
better
get
started
willow
holds
her
hands
in
fists
and
shifts
her
weight
from
one
foot
to
another
i
think
i
might
pee
my
pants
you
can
do
it—the
magicks
not
the
pants
thing
ok
willow
breathes
deeply

sits
