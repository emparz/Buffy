a

you
had
it
remov—you
removed

were
talking
about
i
made
that
up
giles

i
knew
the

was
there
because
his

squeaked
giles
sits

buffy
it's
crucial
that
we

the

and
now

oh
nothing

he
was
in

had
a

before
remember
when
the
first
had
him
kill
and
sire
all
those
people
we
have
no
idea
if
his
chip
was
working
then
giles
takes
off
glasses
a
new
chip
might
restrain
him
should
the
first
attempt
to
activate
him
again
buffy
turns
to
face
giles
spike
has
a
soul
now
that's
what's
gonna
stop
him
from
hurting
people
buffy
he
can
be
a
good
man
giles
i
feel
it
but
he's
never
gonna
get
there
if
we
don't
give
him
the
chance
buffy
walks

her
closet
to
put
the
clothes
away
giles
walks
up
to
buffy
buffy
i
want
more
for

i
can
hear
it
in
your

and
that
way
lies
a
future
filled
with
pain
i
don't
want
that
for
you
we
haven't—
buffy
looks
uncomfortable
things
have
been
different
since
he
came
back
it
doesn't
matter
if
you're
not
physical
with
each
other
anymore
there's
a
connection
you
rely
on
him
he
relies
on
you
that's
what's
affecting
your
judgment
you
think
i'm
losing
sight
of
the
big
picture
but
i'm
not
when
spike
had
that
chip
it
was
like
having
him
in
a
muzzle
it
was
wrong
you
can't
beat
evil
by
doing
evil
i
know
that
buffy

cut
a

of
pipe
with

he

over

hi
can
i

you
seem
kind

confused
lissa
holding
a
rope
looks
at
his

you
aren't
wearing
a

apron
confused
but
sort
of
randomly
observant
sorry
i
just
mean
you
don't
work
here
right
no
right
just
helpful
i'm
xander
lissa
lissa
they
shake
hands
and
i
guess
i
could
use
some
advice
i
can't
even
figure
out
if
i've
got
the
right
kind
of
rope
that
depends
on
what
you
need
it
for
something
like
functional
around
the
house
or
you
know
recreational
xander
lissa
raises
her
eyebrows
and

by
which
i

for

boating
or
mountain
climbing—not
for
tying
someone
up
for
sexy
funky
fun
xander
lissa
giggles
in
conclusion
rope
can
be
useful
in
various
ways
i
have
a
kayak
again
with
the
random
i
like
it
sorry
i
need
to
store
my
kayak
so
i
was
thinking
maybe
i
could
sorta
suspend
it
from
the
ceiling
in
the
garage
with
ropes
and
a
pulley
or
a
winch
thing
not
a
bad
plan
you'll
need
stronger
rope
than
that
wanna
have
coffee
with
me
later
what
oh
you're
the
only
one
that
gets

preparing
for
tomorrow's

if
that's
all
right
with
you
i
mean
you
don't
have
to
i'm
certainly
not
saying
come
to
dinner
if
you
enjoy
having
a
job
principal
wood
chuckles
then
realizes
what
he
said
you
know
i
may
have
to
make
up
a
document
saying
i
didn't
just
say
that
and
have
you
sign
it
buffy
smiles
sure
i'd
be
happy
to
have
dinner
with
you
great
i'll
draw
up
the
paperwork
buffy
nods
and
walks
out
of
the
office
principal
wood
closes
his
office
door
after
her
then
takes
a
bloody
handkerchief
out
of
his
breast
pocket
he
unfolds
the
bloody
handkerchief
revealing
a
knife
inside
wiping
the
blood
off
the
knife
he
walks
toward
the
cabinet
buffy
had
been
curious
about
upon
opening
it
there's
just
a
standard
dryerase
board
inside
until
the
principal
raises
it
out
of
the
way
to
show
a
hidden
compartment
behind
it
where
dozens
of
exotic
knives
are
displayed
he
puts
the

he's
holding
back
in

day
buffy's
sitting
on
the
couch
while
willow's
folding
laundry
from
the
laundry
basket
beside
her
willow
folding
socks
so
he
asked
you
out
to
dinner
yeah
isn't
that
weird
i
mean
he's
a
principal
he's
a
young
hot
principal
with
earrings
but
he's
a
principal
why
do
you
think
he
asked
me
out
i
mean
he
could
be
interested
right
yeah
sure
you're
a
frisky
vixen
or
it
could
be
workrelated
maybe
i'm
getting
promoted
for
doing
such
a
good
job
willow
laughs
then
notices
buffy's
hurt
look
and
gets
serious
oh
right
that—that
makes
sense
too
or
maybe
he
knows
that
i
suspect
he's
up
to
something
and
he's
taking
me
out
to
kill
me
willow
shrugs
well
you'll
have
to
dress
for
the
ambiguity
you
know
it's
not
even
that
he's
acting
that
suspicious
it's
just—there
he
is
on
the
hell
mouth
all
day
every
day
that's
got
to
be
like
being
showered
with
evil
only
from
underneath
not
really
a
shower
a
bidet
like
a
bidet
of
evil
buff
if
he's
really
interested
willow
smiles
are
you
interested
back
buffy
blushes
i
don't
know
he's
goodlooking
and
he's—he's
solid
he's
smart
he's
normal
so
not
the
wicked
energy
which
is
nice
'cause
i
don't
want
to
only
be
attracted
to
wicked
energy
or
what
if
he
is
wicked
in
which
case
is
that
why
i'm
attracted
to
him
i'm
gonna
wait
for
that
sentence
to
come
around
again
before
i
jump
on
buffy
grins
you
know
what
yeah
i
mean
i
think
i
like
him
and
he'd
be
good
for
me
willow
nods
right
help
you
move
on
buffy
defensively
why
does
everybody
in
this
house
think
i'm
still
in
love
with
spike
no
ii
meant
move
on
from
this
imposed
superselfreliance
let
somebody
get
close
oh
buffy
the
front
door
opens
hey
someone's
here
xander
comes
in
through
the
front
door
giddy
guys
guess
what
happened
willow
grins
buffy
got
a
date
xander
excited
no
i
did
xander
looks
at
buffy
frowning
fine
way
to
steal
my
thunder
sorry
if
it
makes
you
feel
better
it's
principal
wood
and
i
think
he's
aligned
with
the
first
also
like
ten
years
older
than
you
right
willow
teasing
which
is
like
100
years
younger
than
your
type
yay
someone
who
doesn't
remember
the
industrial
revolution
i
think
they're
gonna
end
up
making
out
willow
mocking
holds
a
pair
of
socks
to
her
chest
lovingly
oh
principal
wood
she'll
gasp
i
love
your
lack
of
wicked
energy
buffy
throws
a
pair
of
socks
at
willow
watch
it
or
i'm
gonna
make
you
talk
about
your
new
girlfriend
who
you
hold
hands
with
under
the
dinner
table
and
think
we
don't
notice
how
'bout
yours
xander
is
she
evil
well
she's
interested
in
me
so
there's
a
good
chance
but
i'm
hoping
for
the
best
we're
going
for
coffee
she
has
a
kayak—
giles
and
chaoahn
come
through

bags
dear
lord
i
hate

are
rude

everything
in

food
court
is
sticky
looks
like
you
found
her
some
stuff
oh
hello
yes
that's
gotta
be
rough
getting
just
like
pulled
out
of
your
home
being
told
you're
a
potential
slayer
not
being
able
to
bring
anything
yes
and
the
language
barrier
is
formidable
i
was
concerned
that
my
mandarin
is
a
little
thin
but
as
it
turns
out
she
speaks
cantonese
which
is
thinner
but
we
muddled
through
and
as
i
suspected
ice
cream
is
a
universal
language
chaoahn
speaking
chinese
like
many
from
asia
i
am
lactose
intolerant
i'm
very
uncomfortable
buffy

nodding
talking
through
her
closed
teeth
what'd
she
say
she's
grateful
to
be
in
the
land
of
plenty

chaoahn

let's
um

and
put

jonathan
puts

andrew

willow
and
spike
interesting
and
you're
the
only
one
she
makes

we're
headed
toward
a
fight

you
yeah

the

after
that
newsflash
there's
not

anymore
but
there
is
going
to
be
evil
and
as
long
as
there
is

i
live
and
as
long
as
i
live
you
can
dwell
at
my
side
that

your
assignment

be
hard
they're
just
little
girls
you
want
me
to
hurt

andrew
i
want
you
to

anya's
cleaning
a
spot
on
a
blouse
while
buffy
waits
wearing
jeans
and
a
lace
camisole
i
don't
think
it's
really
a
date
that's
what
i
think
anya
scrubbing
the
shirt
well
it
is
unclear
that's
why
i
chose
a
top
that
says
you
know
i'm
comfortable
in
a
stodgy
office
or
a
swinging
casual
setting—or
killing
you
you
know
if
you're
a
demon
it
also
says
i
sometimes
get
blood
on
my
shoulder
anya
looks
at
the
shirt
again
or
it
might
be
pizza
anya
hands
the
shirt
to
buffy
i
don't
think
i
can
fix
it
thanks
for
trying
and
i
wasn't
talking
about
your
date
anyway
i
was
talking
about
this
sham
date
of
xander's
i
think
it's
part
of
a
plan
to
make
me
jealous
buffy
shakes
her
head
well
it's
not
working
are
you
nuts
of
course
it's
working
observe
mymy
bitter
ranting
hear
the
shrill
edge
of
hysteria
in
my
voice
um
i
should
really
go
find
something
else
to
wear
buffy
walks
out
of
the
room
fine
go
leave
me
here
to
stew
in
my
impotent
rage
anya
buffy
stops
turns
to
look
at
anya
i'm
also
gonna
pee

you
should
probably
go

walking
down

they

buffy
stops
in

soon
as
she
sees

and
tries
to
cover
herself
with

stained

you
look
nice
oh

buffy
looks
down

uh
traditionally
one
wears
something
over
this

you
got
a

buffy
nervous
well
it's
unclear
i
mean
i
have
this
whole
theory
about
a
promotion
or
he's
evil
buffy
i'm
all
right
you
don't
have
to—
what
be
noble
i'm
not
really
i'm
all
right
think
i
still
dream
of
a
crypt
for
two
with
a
white
picket
fence
my
eyes
are
clear
good
i'm
glad
thank
you
never
much
cared
for
picket
fences
anyway
bloody
dangerous
you
should
try
this
too
the
going
out
thing
i
mean
i
mean
there's
that
girl
you
brought
to
anya
and
xander's

always
girls
who
like
the
look—bad
boy
you
know

of
them

can

for

going
to
stand
you
up
lissa

of
karmic
what

love
the

xander
lissa
grabs
his

to
inspect

xander
tries
unsuccessfully
to
stop
her
it's
kinda
rough
if
you're
not
used
to
that
sort
of
thing—
lissa
tastes
xander's
drink
it's
hot
cocoa
well
sometimes

on

behind

looking
on
nothing
no

college

looks
like
the
only
stuff
in
the
system
about
principal
robin
wood
is
superrecent
like
since
he
moved
to
sunnydale
i've
googled
'til
i
just
can't
google
no
more
he's
not
in
there
well
that's
suspicious

storms
into
the

anya
calm
down
they're
educational—
willow
anya
hands
the
papers
to
willow
what's
this
willow
flips
through
the
papers
they
are
crude
stickfigure
drawings
in
black
and
red
marker
depicting
bringer
on
one
vampire
on
another
and
the
slayer
buffy
as
well
there
are
more
but
we
get
the
idea
each
one
shows
a
gruesome
bloody
mess
as
the
creature
shown
is
drawn
killing
someone
or
something
giles
made
them
for
chaoahn
and
now
she's
locked
herself
in
the
bathroom
there's
other
girls
upstairs
and
they're
starting
to
complain
those
are
flashcards
ii
made
them
to
facilitate
her
training
chaoahn
never
had
a
watcher
the
language
problem—
you
showed
her
these
i
wanted
her
to
understand
the
seriousness
of
her
situation
holy
crap
dawn
holds
up
one
of

that
shows

creature
standing
over
a
girl
that's
been
ripped
in
half
along
her
waistline
spilling
a
huge
pool
of
blood
everywhere
perhaps
i'll
rethink
the
approach
in
the
meanwhile
wanna
help
us
get
researchy
we're
trying
to
invade
buffy's
date's

buffy

didn't

really
might
be

for
god's
sake
how
can
anyone
think
about
their
social
life
we
are
about
to
fight
the
original
primal
evil
these

are
in

around
uncomfortable
this
isn't
right
buffy
stops
walking
i
know
it
doesn't
look
promising
but
i
swear
this
place
is
great
it's
the
best
kept
secret
in
town
it's
just
right
down
this
way
principal

they
start
walking
again
well
it
is
one
of
the
nicer
dark
alleys
i
promise
you
it's
just
a
little
bit
further
ok
as
they
walk
down
the
alley
a
vampire
steps
out
in
front
of
them
then
two
more
step
up
behind
them
growling
buffy
starts
fighting
them
immediately
there's
a
horde
of
them
now
she
manages
to
punch
them
and
kick
them
away
from
her
one
by
one
until
she
has
opportunity
to
get
her
stake

purse
she
stakes
one
then
another
then
another

you
set

up
you

buffy
realizes
that
principal
wood
is
also
fighting
off
vampires
without
her
help
buffy
confused
what
principal
wood
overpowers
one
of
the
vampires
and
stakes
him
then
knocks
the
last
one
to
the
ground
staking
him
too
he
flips
the
stake
in
his
hand
then
returns
it
to
his
belt
holster
as
he
walks
back
to
buffy
principal
wood
offers
her
a
hand
to
help
her

we

int

lissa
and
xander
are
sitting
at
a
table
talking
and
you
still
have
to
see
her
like
everyday
yeah
but
i
guess
that's
good
how
is
that
a
good
thing
i
mean
it
seems
like
she
never
let
you
forget
what
happened
well
it's
on
her
mind
a
lot
right
now
because
our
anniversary's
coming
up—i
mean
it
would
have
been
our
anniversary
and
maybe
i
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
forget
it
i
did—it
was
a
bad
thing
and
it
hurt
her
real
bad
and
if
you'd
gone
ahead
and
married
her
even
though
you
had
doubts
that
would've
been
better
i
guess
not
sounds
to
me
like
in
the
long
run
you're
both
better
off
lissa
flirtatiously
i
know
it
turned
out
good
for
me
and
that's
what
really
matters
right
xander
laughs
nods
looks
into
her
eyes
i
should
have
taken
you
on
a
nicer
date
than
this
lissa
smiling
sexily
well
i
can
think
of
something
fun
to
do

night
buffy
and
principal
wood
are
sitting
across
from
each
other
at
a
small
table
in
a
very
elegant
romantic
restaurant
principal
wood
is
talking
to
the
waitress
ordering
from
the
menu
principal
wood
to
waitress
thank
you
this
place
is
nice
how
the
hell
did
you
do
that
principal
wood
chuckles
i've
had
a
little
practice
never
took
on
two
at
once
before
but
i
have
taken
out
a
vamp
here
or
there
and
some
demons
so
you're
freelance
hm
freelance—
principal
wood
nods
i
guess
that's
a
good
way
to
put
it
and
you
know
who
i
am
you're
the
slayer
right
ok
um
so
i'm
guessing
that
you
don't
work
in
an
office
15
feet
above
the
hell
mouth
because
you
enjoy
educational
administration
well
i
actually
do
enjoy
the
work
but
yeah
yeah
you're
right
i
maneuvered
myself
into
that
school
that
office—just
like
i
maneuvered
you
there
the
hell
mouth
draws
the
bad
things
in
close
and
now
we're
headed
for
something
big
buffy
really
big
and
i
need
to
be
here
when
it
happens
i
want
to
help
so
yyou
didn't
hire
me
for
my
counseling
skills
principal
wood
laughs
heartily
then
sees
buffy's
hurt
look
then
straightfaced
they're
valuable
too
whwhy
didn't
you
tell
me
about
you
i
wasn't
sure
about
things
yet
yyou
didn't
think
you
could
trust
me
no
no
no
i
wasn't
sure
i
was
ready
yet—ready
to
jump
into
this
fight
and
now
you
are
well
now
the
fight
is
starting—or
starting
to
start—and
i
don't
have
time
to
worry
anymore
i
have
to
do
something
so
you
knew
who
i
was
before
you
even
came
here
yes
how
how
do
you
know
about
slayers
right
principal
wood
nods
ok
see
when
i
was
a
little
boy
my
mother
was
one
the
one
actually—the
slayer
your
mother—
buffy
sighs
wow
i
didn't
know
that
any
slayers
had
children
well
i
don't
know
of
any
others
she
was
killed
when
i
was
four
i
still
remember
her
but
it's
a
littlefuzzy
you
know
buffy
nervously
um
something
got
her
a
demon—
a
vampire
oh
man
i
went
through
this
whole
avenging
son
phase
in
my
twenties
but
i
never
found
him
so
now
i
just
dust
as
many
of
them
as
i
can
find
i
figure
eventually
i'll
get
him
that's
probably
why
we
got
jumped
outside
i'm
not
very
popular
with
the
bumpyforeheaded
crowd
and
i
bet
you
aren't
either
buffy
shakes
head
no
not
most
of
them
um
so
do
you
have
any
slayer
powers
buffy
giggles
i'm
sorry
i—i'm
just
so
floored
ii
have
no
idea
what
to
ask
no
i
don't
have
powers
no
superstrength
or
mythic
responsibilities
i'm
just
a
guy
with
a
few
skills
'cause
her
watcher
took
me
in
and
raised
me
so
you
decided
to
tell
me
that's
right
in
a
darkened
little
romantic
french
restaurant
um
yeah
principal
wood
nods
yeah
i'm
not
really
sure
how
that
happened
but

tried
shooting
kennedy
with
that
great
there's
gonna
be

fleeing
when

start
firing
so
you're
gonna
have
to
get
them
trapped
someplace
like
the
basement
and
we're
killing
them
because
because
they're
the
future
of
the
slayer
line
when
they're
gone

gone
uhhuh
uhhuh
um
so
why

trigger
it's
not
time
for
him
yet
you
can
wait
for

training
in

basement
but

rely
on
a
locked
door
to
keep
them
in

need
more
andrew

andrew
walks
nervously

andrew
nervously
plays
with
items
on
the
desk
are
you—are
you
made
out
of
the
evil
impulses
of
humans
so
if
everyone
was
unconscious
at
the
same
time
you
would
fade
away
you're
asking
a
lot
of
questions
yes

looking

he's
in

basement
of

ropes
the
one
i
picked
wasn't
strong
enough
yeah
that
would've
been
bad

xander

attached

andrew
giles
anya
willow
kennedy
amanda
and
spike
are
there
willow
with
kennedy
sitting
on
the
chair
leaning
over
willow's
shoulder
so
we're
thinking
it
didn't
go
too
well
dawn
to
andrew
removing
the
tape
that
held
the
wire
to
his
chest
you
should've
let
me
do
this
fast
andrew
wincing
no
no
no
i
hate
that
ow
you
tried
to
recall
the
ultimate
evil
why
in
a
complex
effort
to
royally
piss
it
off
guess
we
succeeded
pretty
good
huh
god
i
never
should
have
gone
in
wired
andrew
whiny
redemption
is
hard
getting
back
to
spike's
question
why
did
you
try
to
recall
it
ooh
to
study
it
to
see
if
we
could
figure
something
out
from
what
it
was
saying
because
guys
we
have
to
face
it
we
know
nothing
about
the
first
owie
ow
ow
well
we
know
not
to
record
it
that's
something
why
did
it
appear
to
this
one
then
spike
gestures
to
andrew
i
thought
it
was
supposed
to
be
pulling
my
strings
it
said
it
wasn't
time
for
you
yet
andrew
dawn
pulls
off
the
last
piece
of
tape
ow
i'm
frightened
and
my
chest
hurts
where
the
tape
was
andrew
sits
down
it's
ok
andrew
you
did
good
you
stood
up
to
it
that's
really
amazing
thank
you
you're
a
peach
yeah
what
did
it
want
you
to
do
anyway
shoot
all
the
girls
dawn
worried
shoot
girls
not
you
just
the
potentials
dawn
relieved
oh
well
that's
something
anyway
dawn
covering
for
her
relief
looks
around
sounding
concerned
again
something
tragic
this
proves
my
point
this
time
is
crucial
we
should
be
circling
the
wagons
instead
of
doing
things
like
going
out
on
dates
when—when
gunplay
is
imminent
willow
call
buffy
get
her
back
here
we
need
to
dispose
of
the
gun
andand
figure
out
our
next
move
i'll
go
get
her
i'll
call
willow
a
cellphone
rings
in
the
background
bet
that's
her
sometimes
you're
thinking
about
calling
someone—
willow
looking
at
her
phone
no
it's
a
text
message
willow
reading
oh
it's
from
xander
it's
one
of
our
signals
signals
yeah
the
system
we
set
up
a
while
back
like
codes
uh
this
one's
either
i
just
got
lucky
don't
call
me
for
a
while
or
my
date's
a
demon
who's
trying
to
kill
me
you
don't
remember
which
it
was
a
long
time
ago
well
if
we
play
the
percentages
something's
eating
xander's
head
say
that's
gratifying
buffy
will
know
what
to
do
i'll
go
get
her
spike
starts
to
go
that's
ok
willow

we
don't
even
know

willow
calling
willow
picks
up
buffy's

from
the
table
beside
her
that's
not
good
