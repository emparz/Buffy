do
not
ask
again
but
but
i
your
powers
were
a
gift
of
the
lower
beings
you
have
proved
unworthy
of
them
i
was
robbed
of
them
by
your
carelessness
for
a
thousand
years
i
wielded
the
powers
of
the
wish
i
brought
ruin
to
the
heads
of
unfaithful
men
i
brought
forth
destruction
and
chaos
for
the
pleasure
of
the
lower
beings
i
was
feared
and
worshipped
across
the
mortal
globe
and
now
i'm
stuck
at
sunnydale
high
mortal
child
and
i'm
flunking
math
this
is
no
concern
of
ours
you
will
live
out
your
mortal
life
and
die
give
me
another
chance
you
can
fold
the
fabric
of
time
send
me
back
to
that
place
and
i'll
change
it
i
won't
fail
again
your
time
is
passed
do
you
have
any
idea
how
boring
twelfth
graders
are
i'm
getting
my
power
center
back
and
if
you
won't
help
me
then
by
the
pestilent
gods
i
will
find
someone
who
will
the
watcher
council
shrink
is
heavy
into
tests
he's
got
tests
for
everything
tats
rorschach
associative
logic
he
even
has
that
test
to
see
if
you're
crazy
that
asks
if
you
ever
hear
voices
or
you
ever
wanted
to
be
a
florist
ooo
i
used
to
want
wait
florist
means
crazy
right
i
never
wanted
to
do
that
neat
thanks
it's
all
about
emotional
control
plus
obviously
magic
hey
you
wanna
go
to
the
espresso
pump
and
get
sugared
up
on
mochas
i'm
gonna
pass
hit
the
pool
and
do
some
laps
how
come
the
sudden
calisthenics
aren't
you
sort
of
naturally
buff
buff
buff
buff
well
they've
got
us
running
around
on
the
physical
side
too
a
lot
of
reflex
evaluation
and
precision
training
you
know
ii
just
well
ii
wanna
do
better
than
faith
so
very
shallow
competition
is
natural
and
healthy
plus
you'll
definitely
ace
her
on
the
psych
tests
just
don't
mark
the
box
that
says
'i
sometimes
like
to
kill
people'
buffy
i
know
faith's
not
gonna
be
on
the
cover
of
sanity
fair
but
she
had
it
rough
different
circumstances
that
could
be
me
no
way
some
people
just
don't
have
that
in
them
look
i'm
sorry
ii
know
how
you
hate
talking
about
faith
no
it's
okay
no
really
we
should
just
no
iit
doesn't
bother
me
i
mean
it
uh
will
oh
emotional
control
i'm
working
on
it
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
this
is
a
marriage
made
in
heaven
willow
rosenberg
despite
her
unsavory
associations
represents
the
pinnacle
of
academic
achievement
at
sunnydale
high
percy
west
represents
a
devastating
fast
break
ii'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
marriage
part
you've
got
the
brains
match
you
want
us
to
breed
i
want
you
to
tutor
him
percy
is
flunking
history
hey
i'm
challenged
you're
lazy
selfinvolved
and
spoiled
that's
quite
the
challenge
but
we
need
a
winning
year
especially
after
last
year's
debacle
with
the
swim
team

have
our
point
guard

thinks
you're
the
willow
that
belongs
in
this
reality
another
me
you
know
this
isn't
your
world
right
i
mean
you
know
you
don't
belong
here
no
this
is
a
dumb
world
in
my
world
there
are
people
in
chains
and
we
can
ride
them
like
ponies
you
wanna
get
back
there
yeah
so
do
i
this
is
creepy
i
don't
like
the
thought
that
there's
a
vampire
out
there
that
looks
like
me
not
looks
like
is
it
was
exactly
you
will
every
detail
except
for
your
not
being
a
dominatrix
as
far
as
we
know
oh
right
me
and
oz
play
'mistress
of
pain'
every
night
did
anyone
else
just
go
to
a
scary
visual
place
oh
yeah
buffy
i
i
just
something's
happened
that
willow's
dead
hey
willow
wait
a
second
we're
right
there
with
you
buddy
we
saw
her
too
at
the
bronze
okay
she's
there
now
with
a
cadre
of
vampires
looking
to
party
we
can
figure
out
who
she
is
after
we
stop
the
feeding
frenzy
how
many
of
them
were
there
eight
or
ten
should
we
call
faith
no
i
don't
want
her
in
combat
yet
not
around
civilians
hear
hear
guys
what
are
we
gonna
do
with
me
the
other
me
i
don't
know
will
i
mean
we
just
have
to
stop
them
ii
get
that
i
just
kind
of
wanted
to
know
oh
hey
uh
go
ii'll
catch
up
alone
at
last
well
look
at
me
i'm
all
fuzzy
what
do
i
want
with
you
uh
your
little
school
friend
anya
said
that
you're
the
one
that
brought
me
here
she
said
that
you
could
get
me
back
to
my
world
oh
oh
oops
but
i
don't
know
i
kinda
like
the
idea
of
the
two
of
us
we
could
be
quite
a
team
if
you
came
around
to
my
way
of
thinking
would
that
mean
we
have
to
snuggle
what
do
you
say
wanna
be
bad
this
just
can't
get
more
disturbing
ack
ew
no
more
you're
really
starting
to
freak
me
out
ow
you
don't
wanna
play
i
guess
i
can't
force
you
oh
wait
i
can
bitch
it's
extraordinary
it's
horrible
that's
me
as
a
vampire
i'm
so
evil
and
skanky
and
i
think
i'm
kinda
gay
willow
just
remember
a
vampire's
personality
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
person
it
was
well
actually
so
uh
what
do
we
do
now
we
still
have
to
get
to
the
bronze
well
even
if
they're
supposed
to
wait
for
her
they
may
start
feeding
vampires
are
not
notoriously
reliable
so
we
charge
in
much
in
the
style
of
john
wayne
high
casualty
risk
i
haven't
any
other
plan
though
uh
i
have
a
really
bad
idea
they're
still
in
a
holding
pattern
that's
good
it
means
they
must
really
be
afraid
of
you
who
wouldn't
be
are
you
okay
in
that
it's
a
little
binding
i
guess
vampires
really
don't
have
to
breathe
gosh
look
at
those
um
ahem
willow
you
uh
you
go
in
and
defuse
the
situation
as
best
you
can
at
least
try
and
get
some
of
them
to
come
out
and
even
up
the
odds
a
bit
first
sign
of
trouble
you
give
us
a
signal
we
come
in
hard
and
fast
what
is
the
signal
me
screaming
giles
you
and
xander
wait
by
the
back
entrance
good
now
you're
sure
you're
up
to
this
don't
worry
i
won't
do
anything
that
could
be
interpreted
as
brave
we'll
be
right
outside
hi
i'm
back
did
you
find
the
girl
yep
i
did
where
is
she
i
killed
her
and
sucked
her
blood
as
we
vampires
do
you
know
i
think
maybe
i
heard
something
out
there
why
don't
you
go
check
hhow
could
you
kill
her
she
was
our
best
shot
at
getting
your
world
back
i
don't
like
that
you
dare
question
me
maybe
i'll
have
my
minions
take
you
out
back
and
kill
you
horribly
vampires
always
thinking
with
your
teeth
she
bothered
me
she's
so
weak
and
accommodating
she's
always
letting
people
walk
all
over
her
and
then
she
gets
cranky
with
her
friends
for
no
reason
i
just
couldn't
you
know
he's
been
gone
for
a
while
why
don't
you
go
check
on
him
well
boss
since
that
plan
is
out
why
don't
we
get
with
the
killing
oh

is
like
a
nightmare

lock
yourself
in
the
book
cage

spare
how'd
you
manage
to
lock
yourself

open
the
cage
wait
it
occurs
to
me
that
we've
never
really
had
the
opportunity
to
talk
you
know
woman
to
woman
with
you
locked
up
don't
wanna
talk
hungry
what
could
we
talk
about

about
the
ethics
of
boyfriend
stealing
i
don't
know
if
i
feel
like
killing
anymore

so
bored
iit
would
be
like
shooting
fish
in
a
barrel
where's
the
fun
with
all
due
respect
boss
the
fun
would
be
the
eating
maybe
we
should
let
everyone
go

give
them
a
thirty
second
head
start
wait
a
minute
no
i
like
my
plan

we
start

the
creature
from
the
black
lagoon

okay
it
isn't
even
like
i
was
that
attracted

life
or
death
situations

always
all
sexy
and
stuff
i
mean
i
more
