lucky

maybe
we
should
get
the
hell
out
of
this
place
they
could—
find
her
oh
god
is
she
alive
breathing
pulse
we
gotta
get
her
out
of
here
which
way
is
out
there's
other
girls
there's
more
than
faith
we
don't
even
know
how
many
of
us
are
still—
alive
what
was
that
it
could've
been
grinding
metal
it
could've
been—
no
it
was
one
of
them
that's
not
possible
how'd
it
get
in
here
plans
run
oh
no
it's
blocked
oh
my
god
i
told
you
this
wasn't
the
way
cut
the
chatter
up
and
over
wounded
first
let's
go
group
together
form
a
circle
nobody
panic
it's
all
of
us
one
of
him
we
can
take
one
of
these
things
it
was
pretty
amazing
a
whole
grocery
store
just
abandoned
food
lying
around
everywhere
uh
the
produce
was
on
its
way
to
funky
town
but—
ooh
jaffa
cakes
uh
the
apples
still
look
pretty
good
so
everyone
should
uh
check
those
out
did
you
find
buffy
no
but
you
did
that
spell
with
the
little
lights
the
locator
it
crapped
out
on
us
though
no
it
didn'texactly
it
just
took
us
to
an
empty
house
she
must
have
moved
on
already
i'm
afraid
we
have
slightly
worse
news
here
faith
hasn't
returned
with
the
other
girls
something's
gone
wrong
i've
been
here
keeping
morale
up
because
that's
important
we
have
to
go
to
her
guess
so
yes
i'll
stay
here
keep
working
on
that
morale
thing
remember
the
training
everybody
get
ready
aah
there's
another
one
move
move
move
up
and
over
not
that
one
that
one
weapons
over
there
get
the
wounded
we're
leaving
are
there
more
there's
always
more
let's
move
will
come
here
she's
losing
a
lot
of
blood
got
it
the
room
upstairs
is
ready
for
her
good
i
hope
we're
in
time
is
she
ok
is
she
gonna
be
ok
i'm
sure
she'll
be
fine
right
careful
just
mind
her
head
i'll
be
up
in
a
second
you
guys
heal
fast
right
you
slayers
yeah
soshe'll
be
ok
i
don't
know
what's
with
the
axe
thing
i
took
it
from
caleb
it
might
be
important
let's
hope
i
think
we
got
punished
what
we
uhwe
followed
her
and
it
was—
it
didn't
work
out
you
guys
it
was
a
trap
it's
not
her
fault
that
could've
just
as
easily
happened
to
me
so
are
you
are
you
like
back
i
don't
know
i
guess
i'm
not
leaving
so
we
got
a
plan
now
or
anything
yeah
there's
a
plan
get
ready
time's
up
i
still
think
we
got
punished
is
she
breathing
ok
still
unconscious
though
we've
still
got
work
to
do
i
think
it's
maybe
some
kind
of
scythe
the
only
thing
i
know
for
sure
is
it
made
caleb
back
off
in
a
hurry
so
it's
true
scythe
matters
and
ignoring
that
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
this
is
really
quite
ingenious
kills
strong
bodies
3
ways
and
you
say
you
sense
something
when
you
hold
it
not
much
but
it's
strong
and
i
knew
it
belonged
to
me
i
just
knew
it
in
addition
to
being
ancient
it's
clearly
mystical
yeah
i
figured
that
one
out
when
i
king
arthured
it
out
of
the
stone
so
maybe
it's
like
some
kind
of
traditional
slayer
weapon
i
can't
imagine
how
something
like
this
could
exist
without
my
having
heard
of
it
well
the
good
guys
are
not
traditionally
known
for
their
communication
skills
right
um
any
chance
that
it
might
be
something
other
than
a
tool
for
killing
things
the
first's
guys
clearly
wanted
it
out
of
that
stone
it's
not
just
a
tool
it's
important
we
need
to
find
out
whatever
we
can
who
made
it
when
why
does
it
have
a
name
i
don't
know
a
credit
report
just
find
out
fast
we'll
start
work
immediately
yeah
don't
worry
buff
we'll
find
out
everything
there
is
to
know
good
because
right
now
that
thing's
all
we've
got
going
for
us
i
liked
the
real
bandages
better
these
bed
sheets
are
awfully
festive
ecch
yeah
they're
gonna
look
like
mortally
wounded
easter
baskets
what
aw
hhey
we're
supposed
to
use
that
to
sterilize
wounds
mr
giles
said
come
on
what
does
it
really
matter
hmm
good
point
giles
knows
his
single
malt
antiseptics
blech
everything's
horrible
yup
many
of
these
girls
will
die
slaughterhouse
is
what
it
is
what
ohtrying
to
talk
will
just
kill
you
sooner
we
need
supplies
and
not
just
bandages
and
junk
these—these
girls
need
stitches
and
painkillers
yeah
well
i
could
use
a
cookie
but
i'm
not
making
reckless
wishes
no
no
we
can
do
it
the
hospital
it's
gotta
be
all
abandoned
like
the
grocery
store
supplies
just
lying
around
for
the
taking
i'm
going
in
you
are
and
you're
coming
with
me
i
am
well
i
think
you
should
drive
'cause
that
scotch
made
me
a
little
dizzy
ok
i'll
get
kennedy
to
watch
the
girls
she's
tough
imminent
death
won't
bother
her
what
you
got
it
wait
i'm
not
to
the
got
it
place
yet
i'm
still
in
the
neighborhood
of
you've
gotta
be
kidding
you
know
it's
for
the
good
i
don't
buffy
do
you
get
that
if
i
do
this
that's
it
for
me
for
this
fight
i
feel
like
you're
putting
me
out
to
pasture
of
course
i'm
not
putting
you
out
to
pasture
what
does
that
even
mean
well
you
know
it's
like
uh
when
a
cow
gets
old
and
loses
an
eye
or
its
ability
to
be
milked
the
farmer
takes
it
and
puts
it
in
a
different
pasture
so
it
won't
have
to
fightwith
the
priests
look
i
don't
need
you
to
protect
me
i'm
not
i
got
hurt
but
i'm
not
done
i
can
still
fight
i
know
that's
why
i
need
you
to
do
this
xander
i
need
someone
that
i
can
count
on
no
matter
what
happens
i
just
always
thought
that
i
would
i
would
be
there
with
you
you
know
for
the
end
hey
well
not
that
this
is
the
end
thanks
a
lot
no
no
no
by
the
end
i
meant
uh
a
heroic
uplifting
way
see
i'm
still
optimistic
you're
just
thrown
off
a
little
by
this
grittylooking
eye
patch
i
know
what
you
meant
i
should
be
at
your
side
that's
all
i'm
saying
you
will
be
you're
my
strength
xander
you're
the
reason
i
made
it
this
far
i
trust
you
with
my
life
that's
why
i
need
you
to
do
this
for
me
ok
also
you
can't
shoot
a
bow
and
arrow
anymore
and
every
time
you
pick
up
a
sword
i
worry
that
you're
gonna
break
one
of
our
good
lamps
hey—
don't
look
at
me
you're
the
one
who
said
i'm
gonna
die
i
never
said
you
were
gonna
die
i—i
implied
that
you
were
gonna
die
it's
totally
different
yeah
ok
sure
besides
if
you
die
i'll
just
bring
you
back
to
life
that's
what
i
do
ok
before
the
vineyard
was
just
you
know
a
vineyard
it
was
a
monastery
could've
been
put
there
then
some
creepy
monks
messing
with
powers
they
don't
understand
no
it's
older
than
that
it's
prechristian
ok
well
i
found
reference
to
stories
the
monks
used
to
tell
about
something
older
uh
like
some
kind
of
pagan
temple
native
american
no
i
don't
know
ugh
ok
maybe
we're
just
going
about
this
the
wrong
way
maybe
we
should
research
the
weapon
itself
likelook
maybe
it's
the
axe
of
dekeron
said
to
have
been
forged
in
hell
itself
lost
since
the
children's
crusade
where
it
was
said
to
have
killed—
oh
children
i
hope
that's
not
it
well
i
have
reference
to
the
sword
of
moskva
the
uhreaper
of
the
tigris—how
are
we
supposed
to
narrow
this
down
the
illustrations
are
never
clear
enough
oh
damn
we're
running
out
of
time
we
really
haven't
got
anything
useful
do
you
sense
any
of
the
power
that
buffy
spoke
about
gotta
say
no
must
be
a
slayer
thing
tapping
into
magicks
might
help
with
that
maybe
but
i
mean
if
caleb
is
scared
of
this
thing
it
must
be
pretty
dangerous
and
tapping
into
that
willow
you
could
do
it
without
endangering
yourself
if
i
tried
something
big
i'd
change
and
then
it's
all
black
hair
and
veins
and
lightning
bolts
i
can
hardly
do
a
locator
spell
without
getting
dark
roots
and
if
it
was
necessary
honestly
i
don't
know
all
right
do
what
you
can
that's
all
any
of
us
can
do
i
guess
so
ugh
man
none
of
these
sound
right
i
mean
look
here's
one
that's
just
m
question
mark
what
the
heck
is
that
let
me
see
it's
not
a
question
mark
it's
the
international
phonetics
alphabet
symbol
for
glottal
stop
a
whoey
it's
sort
of
a
gulping
noise
i'mremembering
something
here
um
ah
hieroglyphs
hieroglyphs
stand
for
sets
of
consonants
as
you
know
yes
absolutely
m
plus
glottal
stop
is
represented
by
a
picture
that's
commonly
thought
to
symbolize
a
sickle
or
a
scythe
it's
in
thousands
of
carvings
in
egypt
throughout
the
ancient
world
carvings
like
you'd
have
on
a
pagan
temple
go
back
see
what
else
we
can
find
out
about
this
temple
the
scythe
is
a
symbol
of
death
let's
see
where
these
pagans
buried
their
dead
xander
my
crossbow
is
not
out
here
i
told
you
i
don't
leave
crossbows
around
all
willynilly
not
since
that
time
with
miss
kitty
fantastico
hey
did
you
know
i
have
to
take
a
driving
test
every
year
now
because
you're
old
no
because
of
my
eye
it's
a
whole
state
law
they
don't
trust
my
depth
perception
anymore
that
sucks
and
you
know
what's
even
worse
all
the
stupid
it's
all
fun
and
games
until
someone
loses
an
eye
jokes
hey
xander
so
no
more
fun
and
games
huh
giles
was
just
having
fun
with
you
that's
not
the
point
it's
an
obvious
joke
it'd
be
like
someone
calling
me
a
cyclops
oh
ok
so
not
that
funny
i
mean
uh
give
me
some
eye
of
the
beholder
jokes
you
know
or
uh
some
eye
for
an
eye
jokes
or
maybe
even
a
postmodern
i
claudius
joke
you
know
it's
about
standards
dawnie
i
know
sighs
just
uh
be
creative
look
everyone's
still
kind
of
on
guard
around
you
but
before
you
know
it—
aah
aah
not
that
i
care
personally
but
you
are
wasting
a
lot
of
robust
fullbodied
merlot
why
did
you
let
her
go
you
know
i
can
take
her
in
a
fight
we'll
get
her
calm
down
i'm
calm
you
should
see
me
when
i
get
angry
she's
powerful
right
now
and
you're
weak
you
know
all
of
a
sudden
i'm
getting
less
calm
face
it
your
strength
is
waning
it
has
been
quite
some
time
since
we've
merged
maybe
you're
right
ok
let's
do
it
boy
you
sure
know
how
to
romance
a
girl
no
flowers
no
dinner
no
tour
of
the
rectory
just
ok
i'm
ready
let's
do
it
help
me
my
knees
are
weak
watch
what
you
say
now
you're
starting
to
sound
like
her
this
is
a
sacred
experience
for
me
and
for
me
as
well
look
when
this
is
all
over
and
our
armies
spring
forth
and
our
will
sweeps
the
world
i
will
be
able
to
enter
every
man
woman
and
child
on
this
earth
just
as
i
enter
you
are
you
trying
to
make
me
jealous
i'm
trying
to
make
you
a
god
i
am
thy
humble
servant
and
i
am
ready
to
serve
thee
you
feel
it
too
don't
you
damn
and
damn
that's
something
i
know
it's
old
it's
strong
and
it
feels
like
like
it's
mine
i
guess
that
means
it's
yours
it
belongs
to
the
slayer
slayer
in
charge
which
i'm
guessing
is
you
i
honestly
don't
know
does
it
matter
it
never
mattered
to
me
somebody
has
to
lead
let's
vote
for
chaoahn
it's
harder
to
lead
people
into
a
deathtrap
if
you
don't
speak
english
it
wasn't
your
fault
i'm
really
not
looking
for
forgiveness
you're
not
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
i
blew
it
you
didn't
blow
it
tell
that
to—
people
die
you
lead
them
into
battle
they're
gonna
die
it
doesn't
matter
how
ready
you
are
or
how
smart
you
are
war
is
about
death
needless
stupid
death
so
here's
the
laugh
riot
my
whole
life
i've
been
a
loner
that's
the
funny
part
did
i
miss
something
i'm
trying
to—
sorry
sorry
go
no
ties
no
buddies
no
relationships
that
lasted
longer
than
well
robin
lasted
pretty
long
boy's
got
stamina
principal
wood
and
you
and
in
my—
don't
tell
me
you
two
got
wriggly
no
no
no
no
we're
just
good
friends
or
mortal
enemies
depending
on
which
day
of
the—
ok
the
point
me
by
myself
all
the
time
i'm
looking
at
you
everything
you
have
and
i
don't
know
jealous
then
there
i
am
everybody's
looking
to
me
trusting
me
to
lead
them
and
i've
never
felt
so
alone
in
my
entire
life
yeah
and
that's
you
every
day
isn't
it
i
love
my
friends
i'm
very
grateful
for
them
but
that's
the
price
being
a
slayer
there's
only
supposed
to
be
one
maybe
that's
why
you
and
i
can
never
get
along
we're
not
supposed
to
exist
together
also
you
went
evil
and
were
killing
people
good
point
also
a
factor
but
you're
right
i
mean
i
i
guess
everyone's
alone
but
being
a
slayer
there's
a
burden
we
can't
share
and
no
one
else
can
feel
it
thank
god
we're
hot
chicks
with
superpowers
takes
the
edge
off
comforting
mmhmm
honey
you're
home
yeah
and
you
did
it
fulfilled
your
mission
found
the
holy
grail
or
the
holy
hand
grenade
or
whatever
the
hell
that
is
right
now
we're
going
with
scythe
you
like
well
pointy
and
wooden
is
not
exactly
the
look
i
wanna
know
better
but
it
does
have
flair
can
see
why
a
girl
would
ditch
a
fella
for
one
of
these
i'm
sorry
about
that
it
doesn't
matter
you're
back
in
the
bosom
all's
forgiven
and
uh
last
nightwas
just
a
glitch
a
bit
of
cold
comfort
from
the
cellar
dweller
let's
don't
make
a
thing
out
of
it
great
i
have
work
to
do
oh
yeah
another
solo
mission
of
course
yeah
it
is
that's
fine
you
don't
have
to
get
shirty
about
it
i'm
not
shirty
and
what
is
shirty
that's
not
even
a
word
all
right
all
right
big
secret
mission
it's
fine
it's
not
a
secret
well
i
mean
it
is
but
that's
the
point
of
the
mission
find
out
the
secret
this
thing
was
forged
by—
i
don't
even
know
i
mean
something
about
a
tomb
on
unconsecrated
ground
that's
what
i
have
to
do
i
need
to
find
out
what
this
is
and
why
i
have
it
and
that's
the
thing
the
preacher
man
was
so
anxious
to
keep
out
of
your
mitts
that
it
is
well
maybe
i'll
swing
by
the
vineyard
when
you
go
make
sure
he's
sitting
tight
great
ok
you're
a
dope
i'm
a
what
you're
a
dope
and
a
bonehead
and
you're
shirty
have
you
gone
completely
carrottop
do
you
see
this
this
may
actually
help
me
fight
my
war
this
might
be
the
key
to
everything
and
the
reason
i'm
holding
it
is
because
of
you
because
of
the
strength
that
you
gave
me
last
night
look
i
am
tired
of
defensiveness
and
weird
mixed
signals
you
know
i
have
faith
for
that
let's
just
get
to
the
truth
here
ok
i
don't
know
how
you
felt
about
last
night
but
i
will
not—
terrified
of
what
last
night
was
god
i'm
such
a
jerk
i
can't
do
this
spike
it
was
the
best
night
of
my
life
if
you
poke
fun
at
me
you
bloody
well
better
use
that
'cause
i
couldn't
bear
it
it
may
not
mean
that
much
to
you
but—
i
just
told
you
it
did
yeahi
hear
you
say
it
but
i've
lived
for
soddin'
ever
buffy
i've
done
everything
done
things
with
you
i
can't
spell
but
i've
never
been
close
to
anyone
least
of
all
you
'til
last
night
all
i
did
was
hold
you
watch
you
sleep
and
it
was
the
best
night
of
my
life
so
yeah
i'm
terrified
you
don't
have
to
be
were
you
there
with
me
i
was
what
does
that
mean
i
don't
know
does
it
have
to
mean
something
no
not
right
now
maybe
when
no
let's
just
leave
it
ok
spike
we'll
go
be
heroes
ooh
this
one
has
oxygen
tanks
they'd
only
be
useful
if
something
big
was
attacking
and
then
we
could
shove
one
down
their
throat
and
blow
'em
up
like
roy
scheider
did
with
that
shark
in
jaws
what
you
are
the
perfect
woman
i've
often
thought
so
wanna
rob
let's
rob
oh
cool
gauze
and
alcohol
tape
and
oh
sutures
if
we
want
to
get
stitchy
with
it
oh
and
there's
a
box
of
ointment
here
i
used
one
of
these
on
a
rash
once
oh
show
me
well
it—it's
healed
up
but
it
was
red
and
crusty
with
these
little
itchy
places
show
me
the
box
full
of
ointments
you
little
freak
and
get
cotton
packing
for
the
big
wounds
it's
gonna
be
bad
isn't
it
yeah
so
how
come
you're
here
i
mean
you
could
just
go
right
yeah
i
did
once
before
before
what
wellthere
was
this
other
apocalypse
this
one
time
and
well
i
took
off
but
this
time
i
don'ti
don't
know
wellwhat's
different
welli
guess
i
waskinda
new
to
bein'
around
humans
before
but
now
i've
seen
a
lot
more
gotten
to
know
people
seen
what
they're
capable
of
and
i
guess
i
just
realizedhow
amazingly
screwedup
they
all
are
i
mean
really
really
screwedup
in
a
monumental
fashion
oh
and
they
have
no
purpose
that
unites
them
so
they
just
drift
around
blundering
through
life
until
they
diewhich
theythey
know
is
coming
yet
every
single
one
of
them
is
surprised
when
it
happens
to
them
they're
incapable
of
thinking
about
what
they
want
beyond
the
moment
they
kill
each
other
which
is
clearly
insane
and
yet
here's
the
thing
when
it's
something
that
really
matters
they
fight
i
mean
they're
lame
morons
for
fighting
but
they
do
they
never
never
quit
so
i
guess
i
will
keep
fighting
too
that
was
kind
of
beautiful
youyou
love
humans
i
do
not
yes
you
do
you
loooove
them
stop
it
i
don't
love
them
and
i'll
kill
you
if
you
tell
anybody
i
won't
tell
anybody
won't
get
a
chance
to
anyway
i
don't
know
you
might
survive
no
you
might
survive
you
know
how
to
handle
a
weapon
and
you've
been
in
this
world
for
like
a
thousand
years
i'm
not
so
i
don't
think
i'll
be
ok
i'm
cool
with
it
i
think
i'd
like
tofinish
out
as
one
of
those
lame
humans
tryin'
to
do
what's
right
yeah
sowheelchair
fight
i'd
forgotten
i'd
forgotten
how
young
you
would
be
comes
from
the
waiting
mind
plays
tricks
i
see
you've
found
our
weapon
who
are
you
one
of
many
welltime
was
now
i'm
alone
in
the
world
so
what
are
you
some
kind
of
ghost
nope
i'm
as
real
as
you
are
justwell
let
me
put
it
this
way—
i
look
good
for
my
age
i've
been
waiting
you
pulled
it
out
of
the
rock
i
was
one
of
those
who
put
it
in
there
what
is
it
a
weapon
a
scythe
forged
in
secrecy
for
one
like
you
who—
i'm
sorry
what's
your
name
buffy
no
really
we
forged
it
in
secrecy
and
kept
it
hidden
from
the
shadow
men
who—
yeah
met
those
guys
didn't
really
care
too
much
for
'em
ahh
yes
then
you
know
and
they
became
the
watchers
and
the
watchers
watched
the
slayers
but
we
were
watching
them
oh
so
you're
like
what
are
you
guardians
women
who
want
to
help
and
protect
you
we
forged
this
centuries
ago
halfway
around
the
world
hence
the
luxor
casino
theme
forged
there
it
was
put
to
use
right
hereto
kill
the
last
pure
demon
that
walked
upon
the
earth
the
rest
were
already
driven
under
and
then
there
were
men
here
and
then
there
were
monks
and
then
there
was
a
town
and
now
there
was
you
and
the
scythe
remained
hidden
i
don't
understand
how
is
it
possible
that
we
didn't
know
any
of
this
we
hid
too
we
had
to
until
now
we're
the
last
surprise
does
this
mean
i
can
win
that
is
really
up
to
you
this
is
a
powerful
weapon
yeah
but
you
already
have
weapons
oh
use
it
wisely
and
perhaps
you
can
beat
back
the
rising
dark
one
way
or
another
it
can
only
mean
an
end
is
truly
near
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
catch
that
last
part
on
account
of
her
neck
snapping
and
all
did
she
say
the
end
is
near
or
here
