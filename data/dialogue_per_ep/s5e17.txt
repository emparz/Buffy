buffy
you're
here
you
all
right
yeah
did
you
find
something
this
one
it's
a
fine
choice
it
speaks
of
your
deep
feeling
for
the
deceased
you
don't
like
it
no
it's
not
that
it's
just
what
if
mom
what
if
she'd
like
something
else
better
dawn
i
mean
how
do
we
know
for
sure
she's
the
one
who
has
to
be
in
it
forever
dawn
maybe
it
wasn't
such
a
good
idea
you
coming
along
it's
fine
it's
just

i'm
serious
yyou
shouldn't
have
to
deal
with
this
stuff
if
you'd
like
a
few
more
minutes
to
decide
no
i
it's
done
it's
fine
okay
okay
i
checked
prices
at
different
florists
and
the
funeral
home
seems
to
be
fairly
competitive
let's
just
go
with
that
it's
easier
what
color
flowers
uh
white
they're
nice
yeah
uh
what
about
an
announcement
people
are
gonna
be
expecting
a
wake
after
the
burial
unless
we
say
something
um
well
we
could
put
a
a
line
in
the
program
expressing
your
mother's
preference
not
to
have
one
there's
no
wake
mom
didn't
like
them
she
said
that
potlucks
are
depressing
enough
as
it
is
she
said
that
when
uh
right
before
she
went
in
for
the
operation
we
had
a
talk
about
what
she
wanted
in
case
she
never
said
anything
to
me
i'm
sure
she
just
didn't
wanna
upset
you
dawnster
now
you
better
get
to
work
on
that
dinner
you
barely
touched
it
you
really
should
eat
something
why
should
i
you're
not
this
isn't
about
i'm
all
phoned
out

it's
my
dad
of
course

your
dad's
still
awol
huh
the
number
he
left
for
us
in
spain
is
no
good
and
i've
left
messages
everywhere
um
how
about
a
line
that
just
says
'following
the
burial
there
will
be
no
wake'
or
gathering
'at
the
request
of
joyce
there
will
be
no
gathering'
uch
that
sounds
lame
what
are
we
gonna
do
after
i
mean
are
we
just
gonna
come
back
here
uh
i
i
don't
know

request
of
the
family
there
will
be
no
wake'
good
yeah
it's
got
uh
i
don't
wanna
be
here
should
i
put

the
top
or
just
a
small
line
at
the
bottom
can
i
go
to
your
place
tomorrow
tomorrow
after
everything
um
well
maybe
you
and
buffy
should
ii
don't
mind
can
i
huh
can
i
go
to
willow's
tomorrow
after
the
service
um
iif
you

to
i
guess
so
i'll
uh
get
my
sleeping
bag
out
of
the
attic
you
going
home
i'm
gonna
stop
by
my
mom's
first
been
doing
that
a
lot
lately
yeah
i
actually
might
stop
by
your
mom's
too
well
i'm
not
going
to
my
place
those
people
are
scary
speaking
of
you
have
got
to
be
kidding
i'm
not
going
in
and
you're
not
leaving
those
you
actually
think
you're
gonna
score
points
with
buffy
this
way
this
isn't
about
buffy
bull
we're
all
hip
to
your
doomed
obsession
they're
for
joyce
like
you
care
about
her
guys
guys
not
here
care
joyce
was
the
only
one
of
the
lot
of
you
that
i
could
stand
and
she's
the
only
one
with
a
daughter
you
wanted
to
shag
i'm
touched
i
liked
the
lady
understand
monkey
boy
she
was
decent
she
didn't
put
on
airs
she
always
had
a
nice
cuppa
for
me
and
she
never
treated
me
like
a
freak
her
mistake
think
what
you
want
un
believable
the
guy
thinks
he
can
put
on
a
big
show
and
con
buffy
into
being
his
sex
monkey
xander
he
didn't
leave
a
card
graveyard
daylight
aerial
shot
of
a
group
of
people
standing
around
the
coffin
fade
to
a
shot
of
buffy
and
dawn
standing
together
we
can
see
xander
and
giles
behind
them
fade
to
a
shot
of
the
coffin
we
commend
to
almighty
god
our
sister
joyce
summers
and
we
commit
her
body
to
the
ground
earth
to
earth
ashes
to
ashes
and
dust
to
dust
the
lord
bless
her
and
keep
her
the
lord
makes
his
face
to
shine
upon
her
and
be
gracious
to
her
the
lord
lift
up
his
countenance
upon
her
and
give
her
peace
hey
um
dawn's
kind
of
ready
to
go
can
we
take
her
with
us
yeah
she
should
probably
get
out
of
here
what
about
you
we
can
wait
if
you
want
i'm
fine
thank
you
i'm
sorry
i
couldn't
come
sooner
oh
dawn
i
wish
i
could
help
more
the
only
thing
is
it'll
get
better
i
promise
you
don't
know
that
sure
she
does
we're
witches
we
know
stuff
what
life
goes
on
and
i
forget
mom
is
that
what
you're
saying
not
forget
no
i
you
you
make
a
place
for
her
in
your
heart
it's
sort
of
like
she
becomes
a
part
of
you
does
that
make
sense
dawn
hey
we
don't
have
to
talk
about
this
now
uh
you
could
just
go
to
sleep
no
i
don't
wanna
sleep
okay
we
can
just
sit
or
or
whatever
you
want
good
'cause
i
know
what
i
wanna
do
now
great
what
are
you
up
for
you
guys
are
witches
and
you
do
magic
and
stuff
you
want
us
to
teach
you
something
uh
like
aa
glamour
or
or
i
could
make
a
stuffed
animal
dance
i
wanna
do
a
spell
i
wanna
bring
mom
back
mm
that
was
different
yeah
it
was
more
intense
it's
because
of
joyce
right
huh
well
she
got
me
thinking
about
how
people
die
all
the
time
and
how
they
get
born
too
and
how
you
kind
of
need
one
so
you
can
have
the
other
when
i
think
about
it
that
way
it
makes
death
a
little
less
sad
and
sex
a
little
more
exciting
again
i
say
huh
well
i
just
think
i
understand
sex
more
now
it's
not
just
about
two
bodies
smooshing
together
it's
about
life
it's
about
making
life
right
when
two
people
are
much
older
and
way
richer
and
far
less
stupid
breathe
you're
turning
colors
i'm
not
ready
to
make
life
with
you
but
i
could
we
could
life
could
come
out
of
our
love
and
our
smooshing
and
that's
beautiful
it
all
makes
me
feel
like
i'm
part
of
something
bigger
like
i'm
more
awake
somehow
you
know
yeah
i
do
of
course
you
wanna
bring
your
mother
back
and
i
wish
we
could
but
it's
not
possible
why
you
guys
do
magic
for
all
kinds
of
things
we
do
but
this
is
different
magic
can't
be
used
to
alter
the
natural
order
of
things
but
all
you
do
is
mess
with
the
natural
order
of
things
you
you
make
things
float
aand
disappear
and
but
we
don't
mess
with
life
and
death
dawn
i
know
how
bad
you
hurt
you
don't
they
put
her
in
the
ground
they
did
and
it's
awful
and
unfair
but
this
isn't
the
way
i'm
not
even
sure
it's
possible
dawn
i
mean
i've
seen
things
on
resurrection
but
there's
books
and
stuff
but
i
guess
the
spells
backfire
that's
not
the
point
that's
not
the
point
the
the
point
is
it's
bad
because

because
witches
can't
be
allowed
to
alter
the
fabric
of
life
for
selfish
reasons
wiccans
took
an
oath
a
long
time
ago
to
honor
that
so
it's
possible
to
bring
someone
back
they
wouldn't
have
taken
an
oath
if
thy
didn't
know
they
could
do
it
maybe
they
could
but
we
can't
she's
right
dawn
it's
too
dangerous
you
said
you
wanted
to
help
me
dawn
the
funeral
was

it
was
brutal
but
it's
tomorrow
that
i'm
worried
about
what's
tomorrow
that's
exactly
what
i
don't
know
up
until
now
i
i've
had
a
road
map
things
to
do
every
minute
having
to
do
with
mom
tomorrow
the
stuff
of
everyday
living
resumes
and
everybody
expects
me
to
know
how
to
do
it
because

i'm
so
strong
you
just
need
some
time
i'm
sure
everybody
understands
that
time's
not
the
issue
i
can
stick
wood
in
vampires
but
mom
was
the
strong
one
in
real
life
she
always
knew
how
to
make
things
better
just
what
to
say
yeah
you'll
find
your
way
i
mean
not
all
at
once
but
i
don't
know
i
keep
thinking
about
it
when
i
found
her
if
i
had
just
gotten
there
ten
minutes
earlier
you
said
they
told
you
it
wouldn't
have
made
a
difference
they
said
probably
wouldn't
have
made
a
difference
the
exact
thing
they
said
was
probably
i
haven't
told
that
to
anyone
doesn't
make
it
your
fault
you
couldn't
have
done
anything
different
i
didn't
even
start
cpr
until
they
told
me
i
fell
apart
that's
how
good
i
am
at
being
a
grownup
buffy
and
it'd
be
okay
if
it
was
just
me
i
had
to
worry
about
but
dawn
look
it's
okay
i
know
you
don't
feel
like
it
now
but
you
are
strong
buffy
you're
gonna
figure
this
out
and
you
have
people
to
help
you
you
don't
have
to
do
this
alone
it's
gonna
be
light
soon
i
can
stay
in
town
as
long
as
you
want
me
how's
forever
does
forever
work
for
you
that's
a
bad
idea
i'm
seriously
needy
right
now
let
me
worry
about
the
neediness
i
can
handle
it
i
told
you
you
better
go
i'm
sorry
no
i'm
so
grateful
that
you
came
angel
i
didn't
think
i
was
gonna
be
able
to
make
it
through
the
night
well
we
still
have
a
few
more
minutes
until
i
have
to
go
good
good
tell
my
sister
i'm
sick
of
running
into
her
jawa
rejects
she
bade
me
come
to
you
the
news
of
your
relationship
with
the
slayer
we
don't
have
a
relationship
but
you
attempted
to
court
her
did
you
not
you're
more
fun
when
i
hit
you
it's
just
glory
would
like
to
encourage
this
interest
of
yours
in
the
slayer
it
might
lead
to
more
information
about
the
key
and
why
would
i
share
that
with
the
most
unstable
one
time
is
running

moment

fight
glory

only
fighting
yourself
you
see
fine
let
the
best
me
win
let
glory
understand
this
i
won't
help
her
find
the
key
i
would
never

to
an
innocent

innocent
the
key

an
interesting
choice
of
words

not
what
i
i
understand
sir
i'm
sorry
to
have
bothered
you
i'll
take

course

you're
gonna
run

it
where

a
clue

have
been
a
log
or

one's
mum
kicked
it
a
few
days
back
ohh
i'm
so
sorry
so
we
were
wondering
what's
to
be
done
about
it
heard
you
were
the
one
to
ask
ohh
no
no
that's
uh
you
don't
wanna
mess
with
that
uh
i
know
some
tonics
uh
make
the
grieving
fly
by
i
don't
want
any
tonics
either
one
of
you
witches
got
any
experience
with
uh
spells
of
this
magnitude
didn't
think
so
ow
well
your
mother's
a
good
candidate
at
least
strong
dna
right
i've
gathered
some
ingredients
but
the
spell
i
found
there's
things
on
it
i
don't
understand
we've
got
the
ghora
demon
standing
between
you
and
success
that's
the
translation
you
were
missing
ghora
i've
heard
of
those
they
local
yeah
they
like
to
stick
close
to
the
hellmouth
egg
of
the
ghora
gives
life
it's
key
to
the
spell
can
you
buy
it
this
egg
or
if
it
was
as
easy
as
making
an
omelet
everyone
would
try
it
no
you
have
to
steal
the
egg
from
the
nest
of
the
demon
and
the
ghora
won't
be
happy
about
it
where
do
we
find
this
demon
first
things
first
we'll
need
an
image
of
your
mother
a
photo
a
painting
no
problem
once
you
get
all
the
ingredients
together
put
them
in
the
center
of
a
sacred
circle
with
the
photo
of
your
mother
then
say
this
incantation
three
times
she
won't
appear
you
know
poof
it'll
take
a
while
but
she
will
come
to
you
got
it
got
it
oh
anything
goes
wrong
the
only
way
to
reverse
the
spell
is
to
destroy
the
image
of
your
mother
understand
i'll
do
it
right
it's
a
tricky
spell
girl
i
can't
say
for
sure
your
mother
will
come
back
exactly
like
she
was
sometimes
these
things
get
a
little
off
but
she'll
still
be
my
mother

she
more
or
less
good

i
think
that
was
yesterday
you
had
two
eggs
sunnysideup
i
remember
'cause
they
were
wiggling
at
me
like
little
boobs
sassy
eggs
what
are
you
writing
this
for
my
journal
that's
new
yeah
ii
figured
life
goes
by
so
fast
if
you
don't
write
stuff
down
it
just
gets
lost
and
i
wanna
remember
down
to
every
last
bagel
down
to
every
last
everything
i
do
with
you
huh
what
what

uh
iit
isn't
there
dawn
must
have
taken
it
no
she
didn't
did
she
this
is
bad
this
is
really
bad
but
iit's
just
a
history
book
iit
might
answer
some
of
her
questions
ii
don't
think
she
could
do
any
harm
with
that
stuff
could
she
well
it's
not
a
howto
guide
but
it
refers
to
specific
resurrection
spells
and
potions
but
ii
didn't
i
mean
hey
how'd
she
know
that
ii
don't
know
but
god
what
else
did
she
take
nothing
ii
think
i
think
n
she
took
nothing
else
but
maybe
she
did
and
we
should
probably
look
because
who
knows
