sure
he'll
be
busting
us
out
any
minute
he
will
he's
coming
up
with
a
plan
like
war
games
remember
that
decoder

was
rad
the
one

miss
ferris
matthew
broadway
matthew

your

who
won't
return
your
one
phone

she
must
be
out
of
town
she
doesn't
care
and
neither
does
your
partner
in
crime
warren
don't
say
that
and
what
do
you
mean
my
partner
in
crime
we're
in
this
together
what
do
you
mean
what
do
i
mean
you
two
were
totally
going
to
fly
off
and
leave
me
holding
the
bag
no
we
weren't
i
was
going
to

carry
you
no
you
two
were
setting
me
up
and
then
warren
was
going
to
screw
you
over
too
that
is
so
not
true
sure
he's
a
nice
murderer
who
keeps
his
word
you're
wrong
he's
coming
for
us
he's
out
there
right
now
devising
a
brilliant
way
to
get
us
out
of
here
whiskey
straight
up
and
get
a
round
for
the
house
i'm
feeling
expansive
hey
bet
you
don't
get
a
lot
of
humans
in
the
vamp
still
glued
to
the
tv
grabs
warren's
shoulder
and
holds
him
off
i'm
watching
my
program
wouldn't
want
to
interrupt
your
'me'
time
not
even
to
buy
the
guy
who
killed
the
slayer
a
drink
what's
that
took
her
out
myself
i've
been
heading
an
organization
the
trio
you've
heard
of
us
uh

no
not
important
i
cut
them
loose
i
figure
now
that
buffy's
out
of
the
picture
some
things
have
got
to
change
around
here
i
need
a
real
gang
you
know
not
a
not
a
couple
of
wannabes
and
you
killed
the
slayer
with
these
hands
what
are
you
a
warlock
it's
funny
you
mention
that
you
know
i've
explored
all
the
dark
arts
witchcraft
demonology
you
name
it
i
tried
it
against
the
slayer
but
you
know
what
i
found
really
works
gun
you
killed
the
slayer
with
a
gun
in
her
own
backyard
don't
underestimate
science
my
friend
good
oldfashioned
metal
meets
propulsion
man
this
is
gonna
be
good
oh
the
best
this
town
is
ours
ours
maybe
you
are
screwed
metal
meets
propulsion
yeah
but
you
still
better
be
a
good
shot
this
isn't
the
evil
laugh
of
victory
is
it
more
like
the
evil
laugh
of
you're
a
dead
man
okay
uh
what
what's
the
joke
it
was
just
on
the
news
girl
was
shot
in
her
back
yard
she
survived
she's
in
the
hospital
warren
looks
surprised
and
a
little
alarmed
the
others
continue
laughing
slayers
heal
fast
real
fast
yeah
i
was
gonna
eat
you
myself
during
the
commercial
but
now
i
think
it'll
be
more
fun
to
let
the
slayer
degut
you
might
want
to
get
a
head
start
my
friend
'cause
this
girl
is
gonna
be
coming
for
you
big
time
willow
where
do
you
keep
the
black
arts
books
something
terrible
has
happened
i
know
but
you
don't
have
to
do
willow
i
need
power
not
with
those
books
i
can't
let
you
willow
that's
better
buffy
buffy
hey
hello
uh
the
door
was
tara
all
right
who's
next
i
am
hey
you're
new
yeah
and
i
come
bearing
dead
presidents
so
you
think
we
can
just
skip
the
small
talk
how'd
you
find
me
i
talked
to
a
guy
he's
one
of
your
regulars
offered
to
show
me
the
way
for
twenty
bucks
should
have
haggled
most
of
my
customers'll
bring
you
here
for
five
great
great
i'll
file
that
away
look
i'm
in
a
bit
of
a
situation
here
i
tried
to
do
us
all
a
favor
and
eliminate
the
slayer
but
it
i
i
guess
it
didn't
take
killing
a
slayer
that's
big
business
for
a
kid
i'm
not
a
kid
okay
i
had
my
own
guys
the
trio
yeah
you've
heard
of
us
right
what
were
you
a
band
or
something
i
thought
word
traveled
in
the
underworld
you
know
we
were
evil
robots
were
my
thing
you
didn't
hear
about
the
freeze
ray
sorry
so
why
aren't
your
guys
helping
you
look
i
thought
this
was
a
cash
for
service
gig
not
an
interview
process
all
right
i
need
protection
i've
got
the
slayer
after
me
slayer
is
the
least
of
your
problems
you're
right
let's
talk
about
my
skin
troubles
you
know
i'd
say
on
the
scale
of
problems
that
she
ranks
if
i
were
you
i'd
be
worried
about
the
witch
witch
wwhich
witch
willow
slayer's
pal
she's
the
new
power
man
anybody
with
intuition
can
feel
it
she's
going
to
blow
this
town
apart

starting
with
you
me
what
did
i
what
did
i
do
to
her
ookay
okay
i
i
shot
her
friend
i
feel
death
but
the
slayer's
alive
and
and
she
heals
she
might
but
somebody's
stone
cold
and
that
is
why
the
witch
wants
your
head
she
can
sense
your
essence
right
now
man
it's
just
a
matter
of
time
before
she
finds
you
all
right
take
it
all
right
there's
that
and
i
can
get
more
just
give
me
something
hide
or
fight
both
all
of
it
i
i
still
have
a
few
tricks
up
my
sleeve
but
it's
not
enough
i
need
i
need
a
cover
and
i
need
lots
of
fire
power
i
can't
guarantee
anything
not
this
time
the
girl
is
running
on
pure
fury
i've
never
felt
anything
like
it
thank
you
for
the
tip
nostradamus
just
load
me
up
okay
standing
by
we've
got
to
stop
that
bleeding
where
over
by
the
left
ventricle
bp
is
down
to
80palp
we
got
more
bleeding
bp
is
what's
happening
leave
willow
now
will
what
are
you
doing
she's
going
to
die
no
she
isn't
it's
so
small
what
happened
buffy
oh
my
god
are
you
okay
sure
how'd
i
get
here
you've
got
to
stop
doing
this
this
dying
thing's
funny
once
maybe
twice
willow
buffy
hey
what's
wrong
i'll
explain
but
we've
gotta
go
why
it's
time
to
find
warren
this'll
get
me
all
the
way
to
the
border
you'll
have
to
change
to
the
city
bus
it's
all
in
the
folder
faster
i'm
going
as
fast
as
i
willow
faster
will
would
you
cut
that
out
if
you
wanted
to
drive
we
need
to
stop
i
don't
like
this
we're
close
i
can
feel
him
and
we'll
catch
him
and
he'll
go
to
jail
look
i'm
finding
the
whole
getting
shot
very
motivating
but
you're
using
magic
if
i
wasn't
you'd
be
dead
maybe
but
this
isn't
right
okay
this
isn't
how
i
want
it
sometimes
you
don't
have
a
choice
i
think
buffy
gets
the
tiebreaker
on
this
one
she
was
the
one
on
the
ouchy
end
of
the
bullet
will
you
do
have
a
choice
this
isn't
good
for
you
you
made
the
decision
to
stop
for
a
reason
you
promised
us
and
can
i
just
ask
what's
with
the
makeover
of
the
damned
i
mean
the
hair
turn
right
go
go
where
over

humans
it's
not
the
way
how
can
you
say
that
tara
is
dead
i
know
i
know
and
i
can't
understand
anything
not
what
happened
aand
not
what
you
must
be
going
through
willow
if
you
do
this
you
let
warren
destroy
you
too
you
said
it
yourself
will
the
magic's
too
strong
there's
no
coming
back
from
it
i'm
not
coming
back
will
please
please
we'll
get
through
this
together
we
won't
not
your
way
please
just
willow
no
no
more
talking
it's
done
willow
dawn
maybe
she
went
to
the
hospital
to
find
you
i
left
there
hours
ago
she'd
be
back
by
now
dawn
oh
god
i
didn't
want
to
leave
her
alone
dawn
sweetheart
come
on
honey
we
need
to
get
out
of
here
okay
dawn
sweetheart
be
strong
for
me
okay
dawn
we
need
to
go
downstairs
i
don't
understand
i
don't
understand
either
if
you
could
just
sign
this
sure
call
this
number
tomorrow
we'll
have
more
information
okay
thanks
thank
you
i'm
sorry
for
your
loss
so
that's
it
are
the
police
gone
too
coming
back
tomorrow
with
more
of
their
pretty
yellow
tape
we
need
to
find
willow
yeah
she's
off
the
wagon
bigtime
warren's
a
dead
man
if
she
finds
him
good
dawn
don't
say
that
why
not
i'd
do
it
myself
if
i
could
because
you
don't
really
feel
that
way
yes
i
do
and
you
should
too
he
killed
tara
and
he
nearly
killed
you
he
needs
to
pay
out
of
the
mouths
of
babes
xander
i'm
just
saying
he's
he's
just
as
bad
as
any
vampire
you've
sent
to
dustville
being
a
slayer
doesn't
give
me
a
license
to
kill
warren's
human
so
so
the
human
world
has
its
own
rules
for
dealing
with
people
like
him
yeah
we
all
know
how
well
those
rules
work
sometimes
they
do
sometimes
they
don't
we
can't
control
the
universe
if
we
were
supposed
to
then
the
magic
wouldn't
change
willow
the
way
it
does
and
we'd
be
able
to
bring
tara
back
and
mom
there
are
limits
to
what
we
can
do
there
should
be
willow
doesn't
want
to
believe
that
and
now
she's
messing
with
forces
that
want
to
hurt
her
all
of
us
i
just
i've
had
blood
on
my
hands
all
day
blood
from
people
i
love
i
know
and
now
it
has
to
stop
warren's
going
to
get
what
he
deserves
i
promise
but
i
will
not
let
willow
destroy
herself
okay
where
do
we
go
she
could
be
anywhere
i
don't
know
um
maybe
the
magic
box
for
some
kind
of
locating
spell
i
could
go
myself
no
no
i'm
cool
i'll
go
dawn
can't
stay
here
by
herself
let
me
go
with
you
i
want
to
no
honey
it's
too
dangerous
but
it's
willow
she
needs
us
she
does
and
you'll
help
her
lots
okay
but
first
we
have
to
get
her
home
in
one
piece
but
buffy
dawn
i'm
serious
you've
been
through
enough
for
more
than
one
ever
you
should
be
someplace
where
you
feel
safe
fine
i
want
to
go
to
spike's
all
right
what
not
all
right
are
you
kidding
after
what
spike
did
buffy
xander
i'll
get
the
coats
you're
not
gonna
really
leave
dawn
with
mr
attempted
rape
he
won't
hurt
dawn
i
hehe
physically
can't
besides
he
wouldn't
well
after
the
other
night
i'd
say
all
bets
are
off
on
what
he's
capable
of
dawn
feels
safe
with
him
we
don't
have
a
choice
right
now
he's
all
we've
got
blood
of
the
slain
hear
me
guide
me
to
tara's
killer
john
why
don't
you
forget
this
foolishness
stop

where
you
are
mr
norton
john
john
spike
suffering
cats

empty
for
a
few
days
you'll
lose
it

surprised
he
didn't
tell

guess
sure
i
can't
get
you
something
