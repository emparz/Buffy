you
demons
can't
resist
a
run
and
stumble
can
you
one
down
one
gone
so
scabby
demon
got
away
scabby
demon
number
two
got
away
scabby
demon
number
one
big
check
in
the
slay
column
i
don't
like
this
whole
no
mouth
thing
it's
disquieting
well
no
mouth
means
no
teeth
unless
they
have
them
somewhere
else
here
we
go
we've
been
researching
the
uh
mayor's
forthcoming
ascension
it's
pretty
riveting
stuff
what
do
we
know
what
don't
we
know
tell
her
giles
based
upon
the
supposed
date
graduation
day
and
the
mayor
being
impervious
to
harm
i've
crossreferenced
xander
he's
a
crossreferencing
fool
and
i've
eliminated
several
possibilities
it's
not
the
ritual
flaying
of
the
demon
azarath
nor
the
uh
i
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
that
was
kind
of
an
anticlimax
we
don't
know
anything
the
whole
fake
angel
thing
was
for
nothing
no
no
no
if
nothing
else
angel's
charade
has
brought
faith's
treachery
to
the
open
and
this
information
on
the
ascension
will
prove
useful
eventually
i
just
need
to
put
it
together
we
see
buffy
scratching
at
her
hand
as
wesley
enters
looking
dapper
as
ever
terribly
sorry
i
was
detained
official
counsel
business
mr
giles
you
were
speaking
i
was
just
filling
buffy
in
on
my
progress
regarding
the
research
on
the
ascension
oh
and
what
took
up
the
rest
of
the
minute
touch√©
of
course
my
work
is
un
official
i'm
sure
however
with
the
resources
of
the
council
at
your
disposal
you
will
have
something
to
add
well
i
am
pleased
to
state
with
certainty
that
the
demon
azarath
will
not
in
any
way
be
involved
i'm
sure
we'll
find
out
more
soon
demon
azarath
so
have
you
talked
to
angel
lately
not
really
seeing
him
bad
even
pretend
bad
and
with
faith
he
only
kissed
her
for
the
greater
good
i
don't
know
to
the
naked
eye
it
looked
like
fun
or
maybe
it
wasn't
maybe
he
wasn't
even
tempted
i
just
wish
i
could
be
sure
as
always
i
advise
you
to
ask
think
he'd
tell
me
hogan
great
game
man
hogan
martin
thinks
he's
sooooo
hot
like
we
should
all
be
awed
by
him
cuz
he
can
put
a
ball
in
the
net
hey
xander
he
said
my
name
he
knows
my
name
hey
will
hi
um
look
i
can't
make
the
study
session
after
school
ummmm
can
we
do
it
5th
period
ok
did
you
finish
the
reading
most
of
it
percy
i'll
finish
it
at
lunch
that's
my
little
trooper
hogan
i
don't
know
what
you're
doing
to
him
i
actually
heard
him
complete
a
sentence
it
had
a
clause
and
everything
you're
watching
the
game
right
wouldn't
miss
it
see
ya
hogan
you're
going
to
the
game
i
didn't
know
you
liked
basketball
i
didn't
either
but
i
really
started
getting
into
it
especially
now
that
we're
in
the
championship
it's
so
exciting
too
bad
you're
patrolling
we're
all
going
oz
xander
everybody
great
everybody
who
isn't
currently
buffy
you
touched
one
of
the
demons
a
good
touch
not
a
bad
touch
anyway
it's
been
itching
like
crazy
no
big
just
another
problem
for
the
good
people
at
lubriderm
right
that's
the
demon
in
question
in
the
disgusting
flesh
hmm
what
it
says
they
can
infect
the
host
infect
infect
giles
infect
oh
um
infect
the
host
with
an
aspect
of
the
demon
that's
all
it
says
an
aspect
of
the
demon
it's
rather
terse
isn't
it
you
mean
like
a
part
of
it
there
could
be
any
number
of
explanations
for
your
hand
a
new
fabric
softener
can
cause
irritation
in
any
case
i
would
advise
not
to
attempt
to
track
the
one
that
got
away
let's
minimize
your
exposure
part
of
the
demon
i
hope
it's
not
the
outside
part
h
o
g
a
n
it's
hogan
goooo
hogan
is
it
me
or
is
this
really
lame
i
don't
know
i
usually
enjoy
lameness
and
this
is
leaving
me
kinda
cold
well
according
to
freddy's
latest
editorial
'the
pep
rally
is
a
place
for
pseudoprostitutes
to
provoke
men
into
a
sexual
frenzy
which
when
thwarted
results
in
pointless
athletic
competition'
xander
and
the
downside
being
the
school
paper
is
edging
on
depressing
lately
you
guys
notice
that
i
don't
know
i
always
go
straight
to
the
obits
what
are
you
doing
buffy
nothing
checking
for
horns
ah
you
know
buffy
i
don't
even
think
giles
is
right
about
you
becoming
like
a
demon
i
mean
he's
totally
burnt
you
know
dealing
with
faith
and
this
ascension
thing
between
you
and
me
he's
not
doing
his
best
work
what
if
he
is
right
i'm
suddenly
going
to
grow
this
demon
part
and
we
don't
even
know
what
it
is
it
could
be
claws
or
scales
what
was
it
a
boy
demon
t
o
m
it's
tom
goooo

good
their
spelling's
improved
you
know
oz
i
look
at
all
this
beauty

i
wonder
why
i
ever

my
time
on
cordelia

at
her
she's
no
better
looking
than
the
rest
of
them
none
of
them
are
really
my
oh

god
he's
looking
at
her
he's
got
his
filthy
adult
pierce
brosny
eyes
all
over
my
cordy
you're
a
very
complex
man
aren't
you
back
to
will
and
buffy
it's
just
i'm
scared
will
there's
this
thing
in
me
and
i
can't
find
it
i
can't
stop
it
what
if
it
changes
me
not
just
the
way
i
look
all
of
a
sudden
i
could
be
something
that's
not
me
anymore
7

percy
gooo

saying
really
and
i
would
be
frightened
too
but
i'm
sure
you're
gonna
be
okay
still
gotta
mouth
sorry
it's
okay
i
didn't
see
you
so
i
should
have
known
you
were
there
what
are
you
doing
here
it's
a
dangerous
time
you
know
with
faith
yeahfaith
shewell
faith
what
can
ya
say
about
her
i
just
wanna
make
sure
you're
you
know
ok
that
you're
safe
and
the
fact
that
you're
right
here
does
that
mean
faith's
around
are
you
keeping
me
safe
by
tracking
me
or
are
you

her
i'm
tracking
you
something's
bothering
you
a
lot
of
things
the
most
recent
being
this
demon
actually
two
i
touched
one
of
them
and
now
i'm
gonna
get
a
big
case
of
the
bumpies
or
a
tail
or
something
an
aspect
of
the
demon
you
know
the
drill
by
rumor
that
doesn't
mean
anything
i
mean
sometimes
demons
they
just
exagerate
their
power
demon
hype
maybe
not
i
spend
all
my
time
in
the
dark
here
anyway
it's
not
like
i'd
be
at
a
gain
you
know
with
my
friends
where
someone
could
see
me
and
my
new
monster
part
hey
i
won't
let
anything
happen
to
you
if
i
can
help
it
no
matter
what
i'll
always
be
with
you
hey
i'll
love
you
even
if
you're
covered
with
slime
i
liked
everything
until
that
part
could
you
believe
it
right
at
the
buzzer
three
points
for
the
win
it
was
intense
yeah
for
a
minute
there
i
thought
you're
gonna
make
an
expression
well
i
felt
one
coming
on
i
won't
lie
man
i've
never
seen
anyone
jump
like
hogan
martin
they
should
call
him
the
jumper
or
a
name
that
isn't
an
article
of
women's
clothing
hey
remember
when
willow
shhh
hmmm
quietness
we
either
lost
or
we
won
and
you
don't
want
me
to
feel
bad
well
yeah
it
wasn't
a
really
good
game
yeah
tall
hoops
with
thin
tall
guys
what's
the
point
pretty
dull
are
you
guys
crazy
that
was
an
incredible
game
i've
never
cheered
so
hard
in
my
life
i
still
have
knee
marks
on
my
back
from
the
pyramid
yeah
well
i
still
bet
patrolling
was
way
better
cause
wow
important
well
i
thought
i
saw
a
four
legged
demon
but
it
was
just
a
dog
a
weredog
regular
xander
tough
luck
i
wonder
if
she
and
wesley
have
kissed
it
really
bugs
you
huh
what
cordelia
and
wesley
smooching
man
you
read
my
mind
ooo
whoa
there
you
watch
where
you're
going
now
i'm
sorry
mr
beech
i
will
students
if
we
could
just
get
rid
of
all
the
students
when
i'm
a
sophomore
jillionaire
and
you're
all
flipping
burgers
who's
the
loser
then
'maybe
i'll
take
french
i
said
how
hard
can
it
be
french
babies
learn
it'
idiot
i
swear
someday
my
pants
are
gonna
fall
right
off
buffy
is
so
beautiful
i
mean
look
at
that
body
god
i
would
love
to
shove
her
against
that
locker
right
now
and
just
oooh
she
mentally
freaks
and
hurries
past
she
almost
bumps
into
another
guy
who
looks
at
her
we
don't
hear
his
thought
but
she
breaks
into
a
run
is
this
the
thing
the
aspect
thing
because
i
gotta
say
if
it
is
it
is
way
better
than
a
tail
i
mean
i
have
a
hard
enough
time
finding
jeans
that
fit
right
buffy
slow
down
i'm
not
even
convinced
that
this
is
genuine
mind
reading
you're
most
likely
projecting
your
buffy
when
i
walked
in
a
few
minutes
ago
you
thought
'look
at
her
shoes
if
a
fashion
magazine
told
her
to
she'd
wear
cats
strapped
to
her
feet
ium
the
demons
are
telepathic
i
should
have
known
that's
why
they
didn't
need
mouths
of
course
demons
are
telepathic
i
know
you
just
told
me
that's
why
they
don't
need
mouths
and
you
should
have
known
this
is
astounding
it
was
happening
out
in
the
hallway
principal
snyder
has
walk
like
an
egyption
stuck
in
his
head
and
the
boys
at
this
school
are
seriously
disturbed
it's
wierd
but
giles
think
about
it
think
about
what
i
could
do
it
could
be
very
useful
you
could
anticipate
your
opponent's
every
move
turn
his
plans
against
him
oh
way
better
than
that
jealousy
buffy
right
very
good
i
knew
that
jealousy
clearly
is
the
tool
that
iago
uses
to
undo
othello
but
what's
his
motivation
what
reason
does
iago
give
for
destroying
his
superior
officer
cassio
has
my
place
twix
my
sheets
he's
done
my
office
well
he
was
passed
over
for
promotion
cassio
was
picked
instead
and
people
were
saying
that
othello
slept
with
his
wife
buffy
did
the
reading
buffy
understood
the
reading
when
did
she
study
was
i
supposed
to
study
ms
murray's
kinda
hot
i
was
gonna
say
cassio
uh
i
hate
her
any
other
reason
race
uh
good
nancy
can't
overlook
that
look
at
them
scrambling
for
the
teacher's
praise
like
pigeons
for
thrown
bread
crust
will
who's
that
guy
that's
freddy
iverson
he
writes
those
editorials
for
the
school
paper
he's
sardonic
bread
crusts
that's
deep
i
should
write
that
down
there's
something
else
at
work
here
well
he
um
he
sort
of
admits
himself
that
his
motive
are
spurious
he
um
he
does
things
because
he
he
enjoys
them
it's
like
he's
not
he's
not
really
a
person
he's
a
the
dark
half
of
othello
himself
huh
woah
buffy
really
very
astute
i
said
something
quite
like
that
in
my
dissertation
i
know
uh
i
mean
i
agree
with
that
yes
and
doesn't
that
also
explain
othello's
readiness
to
believe
iago
he
believes
that
she's
been
unfaithful
and
we're
all
like
that
we
all
have
our
little
internal
iagos
that
tell
us
our
husbands
or
our
girlfriends
or
whatever
don't
really
love
us
but
you
never
really
see
what's
in
someone's
heart
oooh
sorry
sorry
about
the
daytime
i
just
ducked
out
of
school
and
that's
when
they
have
it
umyou
look
good
i
mean
i
i
know
i
saw
you
last
night
but
sometimes
things
can
change
really
quick
i
mean
really
quick
listen
to
me
i'm
talking
like
faith
you
know
not
that
she
was
so
bad
to
have
around
you
know
before
the
evil
you
know
i
think
she
was
hurting
a
lot
and
some
people
protective
type
people
might
be
drawn
to
that
i
guess
well
the
thing
about
faith
you
can't
get
into
my
mind
how
did
youwhy
not
it's
like
the
mirror
the
thoughts
are
there
but
they
create
no
reflection
in
you
you
got
the
aspect
of
the
demon
yeah
giles
doesn't
know
how
long
it's
gonna
last
it's
ok
a
little
headachy
but
you
don't
have
to
play
games
with
me
buffy
ever
well
you're
not
exactly
joehere's
whati'mthinking
so
ask
me
oh
but
that
woulda
made
sense
what
do
you
wanna
know
about
faith
how
i
felt
kissing
her
pretending
to
have
no
soul
watching
you
suffer
well
since
you
bring
it
up
i
hated
hurting
you
more
than
i
could
stand
look
the
thing
about
faith
i'd
understand
you
know
she
has
you
know
that
whole
bad
girl
thing
working
for
her
kissing
her
meant
nothing
i
don't
want
a
bad
girl
i've
done
that
before
i've
lived
a
long
time
buffy
and
i'm
past
that
i've
been
with
dozens
of
girls
like
her
more
oh
this
honesty
stuff
is
funnn
i
mean
there's
no
comparison
in
twohundredfortythree
years
i've
loved
exactly
one
person
ohhit
is
me
right
next
time
just
ask
ok
and
buffy
be
careful
with
this
gift
a
lot
of
things
that
seem
strong
and
good
and
powerful
they
can
be
painful
like
say
immortality
exactly
i'm
dying
to
get
rid
of
that
funny
i'm
a
funny
guy
she
can
read
our
minds
our
every
impulse
and
fantasy
every
one
oh
god
i
don't
see
what
this
has
to
do
with
me
i
don't
see
what
this
has
to
do
with
me
well
i
think
it's
great
right
i
mean
you
enjoy
your
other
slayer
powers
yeah
and
it'll
be
fun
did
you
see
nancy
doyle's
face
in
english
class
today
yeah
she's
super
competitive
and
you
really
showed
her
she's
hardly
even
human
anymore

can
i
be
her
friend
now
she
doesn't
need
me

i
do
need
you
ok
what
are
you
talking
about

as

me
a
hand

her
buffy
contains
everything
that
is
me
and
she
becomes
me
i
cease
to
exist

killer

do
us
all
in
with
that
mulligan
stew
xander
i
mean
what
the
hell's
a
mulligan

was
thinking
about
it
they
thought
'this
time
tomorrow
i'll
kill
you
all'
i
have
to
find
them
well
did
you
uh
recognize
a
voice
no
boy
or
girl
i
don't
know
i
mean
it
was
hardly
human
it
was
full
of
so
much
anger
and
pain
annoying
buffy
count
no
i
have
to
find
them
yeah
i
mean
who
hasn't
just
idly
thought
about
taking
out
the
whole
place
with
a
semiautomatic
i
said
idly
i
know
the
difference
he
she
whoever
they
meant
it
they're
gonna
do
it
she
looks
so
tired
how
horrible
i'm
not
getting
any
warmer
i
bet
it
was
hogan
who
could
it
be
shut
up
uh
i'm
sorry
i
it's
just
can
you
guys
not
think
so
loud
or
so
much
buffy
you
should
go
home
i
i'll
take
you
home
yeah
ok
whano
look
i
need
you
guys
to
go
back
to
the
cafeteria
make
a
list
of
everyone
who's
there
we
have
to
find
the
killer
before
lunch
tomorrow
we'll
do
it
buffy
a
list
of
all
the
students
yeah
nancy
was
there
she's
scary
and
uh
oh
teachers
too
mr
beech
he
thought
something
about
getting
rid
of
all
the
students
come
on
i
can't
shut
it
out
giles
it's
like
this
invasion
of
my
head
it's
like
there's
these
strangers
walking
around
in
there
it's
just
a
look
at
this
i
can't
even
be
around
people
anymore
not
that
they're
really
clambering
to
be
near
me
anyway
even
you
i'm
sorry
buffy
it's
hard
for
all
of
us
wesley
and
i
are
are
looking
for
a
way
to
help
i'll
be
okay
right
i
mean
even
if
you
can't
get
rid
of
it
you'll
be
fine
i
promise
if
it
doesn't
go
away
she'll
go
insane
i
think
we
have
everyone
that
was
in
the
cafeteria
i'll
do
some
computer
work
match
it
against
the
fbi
mass
murderer
profiles
see
if
maybe
we
can
rule
some
people
out
i'm
still
having
trouble
with
the
fact
that
one
of
us
is
just
gonna
gun
everybody
down
for
no
reason
yeah
because
that
never
happens
in
american
high
schools
it's
bordering
on
trendy
at
this
point
besides
which
sunnydale
high
center
of
evil
and
all
that
let's
get
to
work
we
have
till
lunchtime
tomorrow
we
hope
there
you
look
better
already
thanks
mom
i'm
uh
i'm
just
going
to
get
you
another
pillow
i
really
don't
need
one
but
you
need
another
blanket
uh
mom
i'm
fine
how
about
some
soup
chicken
and
stars
mom
please
just
come
sit
with
me
i've
uh
i've
got
laundry
why
are
you
you
had
sex
with
giles
you
had
sex
with
giles
it
was
the
candy
we
were
teenagers
on
the
hood
of
a
police
car
i'll
be
downstairs
you
feel
better
twice
okay
i've
taken
our
list
and
narrowed
it
down
to
a
dozen
strong
suspects
here
are
your
personalized
assignments
ooo
i
was
hoping
there'd
be
assignments
i
think
i
should
work
with
wesley
you
have
no
shame
oh
please
like
shame
has
something
to
be
proud
of
be
quiet
sorry
but
but
this
is
important
talk
to
everyone
on
your
list
and
use
the
sample
questions
today
people
oh
write
neatly
and
and
label
your
worksheets
fantasy's
are
fun
aren't
they
jonathan
uh
i
guess
we
all
have
fantasies
that
we're
powerful
more
respected
where
people
pay
attention
to
us
uh
maybe
but
sometimes
the
fantasy
isn't
enough
is
it
jonathan
sometimes
we
have
to
make
it
so
people
don't
ignore
us
make
them
pay
attention
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about
don't
you
em
you
want
me
to
pay
attention
this
is
for
the
yearbook
yeah
personality
profile
can
you
ask
it
again
sure
do
you
ever
feel
that
you've
created
a
false
persona
for
yourself
'the
guy
who
does
everything
right'
and
how
much
of
a
strain
does
it
put
on
you
to
maintain
it
uh
wow
i
guess
moderate
strain
is
that
a
good
answer
i
want
to
get
this
right
yeah
that's
good
hi
mr
beech
i
was
just
wondering
were
you
planning
on
killing
a
bunch
of
people
tomorrow
oh
it's
for
the
yearbook
okay
so
turnoff's
include
smoking
insensitive
men
and
burkenstocks
now
your
idea
of
a
perfect
evening
katie
let's
start
with
you
uh
freddy
i
should
have
just
quit
no
job
is
worth
it
look
at
him
smiling
like
he
thinks
i
don't
know
about
her
i'm
going
to
tell
him
we're
going
to
have
a
baby
oh
i'm
so
happy
i
can't
believe
we're
getting
away
with
this
one
more
drink
then
i'll
well
it
seems
to
be
coming
along
all
right
yes
buffy's
being
driven
mad
we
have
no
proof
that
this
is
going
to
work
and
it
still
requires
the
heart
of
the
second
demon
which
we
have
no
idea
how
to
get
without
the
slayer
negative
thinking
doesn't
solve
problems
who
is
going
to
get
the
demon
heart
burke
do
i
often
imagine
classmates
are
spying
on
me
or
otherwise
acting
suspiciously
right
not
until
just
now
what
talk
louder
dude
i'm
just
saying
it's
gotta
be
frustrating
having
the
secret
you
gotta
be
kinda
filling
up
with
resentment
unexpressed
rage
just
waiting
to
burst
out
today
at
lunch
what
secret
being
gay
man
i'm
out
i'm
so
out
i
got
my
grandma
fixing
me
up
with
guys
that's
uh
nice
but
it
sounds
like
uh
you're
having
a
rough
time
with
it
look
just
do
it
that
weird
freddy
iverson
guy
that
does
the
school
paper
xander
he's
gay
no
dude
but
i
bet
he'd
put
in
like
a
coming
out
announcement
for
you
something
tasteful
freddy
we
see
freddy
stop
at
a
corner
behind
him
freddy
turns
and
goes
the
other
way
he's
the
only
one
we
couldn't
find
yeah
freddy
iverson
the
newspaper
guy
but
we
can't
figure
out
if
it's
him
without
the
worksheet
right
we
do
have
this
people
today's
editorial
titled
'big
game
draws
mindless
brain
dead
mob'
cordelia
does
he
mention
the
cheerleaders
because
we
were
on
i
can't
stand
this
i
keep
wondering
if
i'm
hurting
her
with
my
thoughts
you're
not
not
anymore
she
can't
pick
one
thought
out
of
the
out
of
the
din
a
knock
comes
from
downstairs
they
turn
and
bolt
for
downstairs
wesley
beats
them
to
door
below
he
opens
it
and
a
smoking
figure
covered
in
a
blanket
steps
inside
the
figure
pulls
off
the
blanket
and
we
see
it's
angel
he
holds
a
vial
of
glowing
blue
liquid
i
got
it
uh
no
i'm
gonna
help
you
giles
cut
to
the
sunnydale
high
quad
with
the
'something's
up'
background
music
playing
the
camera
pans
around
the
students
moving
about
the
scooby
gang
passes
through
frame
the
camera
moves
and
then
tilts
up
so
we
see
the
clock
tower
reverse
to
from
the
clocktower
looking
down
at
the
quad
the
camera
pulls
back
into
the
darkness
of
the
tower
we
see
johnathan
step
into
view
he
crouches
down
and
opens
a
steel
case
inside
the
disassembled
parts
of
a
highpowered
rifle
he
grabs
one
of
the
pieces
angel
buffy's
mother
sits
down
on
the
bed
and
we
see
giles
and
wesley
in
the
room
just
behind
her

at
all
nobody
here
really
does
bugs
you
doesn't
it
you

all
this
pain
and
all
these
feelings
and
nobody's
really
paying
attention
you
think
i
just
want
attention
no
i
think
you're
up
in
the
clock
tower
with
a
highpowered
rifle
because
you
wanna
blend
in
believe
it
or
not
jonathan
i
understand
about
the
pain
oh
right
cuz
the
burden
of
being
beautiful
and
athletic
that's
a
crippler
you
know
what
i
was
wrong
you
are
an
idiot
my
life
happens
to
on
occasion
suck
beyond
the
telling
of
it
sometimes
more
than
i
can
handle
and
it's
not
just
mine
every
single
person
down
there
is
ignoring
your
pain
because
they're
too
busy
with
their
own
the
beautiful
ones
the
popular
ones
the
guys
that
picks
on
you
everyone
if
you
could
hear
what
they
were
feeling
the
loneliness
the
confusion
it
looks
quiet
down
there
it's
not
it's
deafening
you
know
i
could've
taken
that
by
now
i
know
i'd
rather
do
it
this
way
i
just
wanted
it
to
stop
yeah
well
massmurder
not
really
doctor
recommended
for
that
type
of
pain
besides
prison
you
know
it's
a
lot
like
high
school
only
instead
of
noogies
what
are
you
talking
about
actions
having
consequences
you
know
stuff
like
that
i
i
i
wouldn't
ever
hurt
anybody
i
came
up
here
to
kill
myself
rat
poison
rat
poison
okay
let's
calm
down
vermin
you're
all
vermin
you
come
in
here
and
you
eat
and
you
eat
filth
i
don't
see
this
being
settled
with
logic
so
you're
feeling
better
about
angel
well
we
talked
and
then
he
ripped
out
the
heart
of
a
demon
and
fed
it
to
me
and
then
we
talked
some
more
see
that's
how
it
should
work
morning
hi
giles
oh
i
should
get
to
the
yearbook
office
i'm
gonna
give
'em
the
murderer
profiles
they're
really
a
good
read
bye
cya
how
are
you
loving
the
quiet
nobody
in
here
but
me
jonathan
how's
he
pretty
crappy
his
parents
are
freaking
he
got
suspended
and
toting
a
piece
to
school
not
exactly
winning
him
a
place
with
the
incrowd
but
i
think
he's
dealing
well
it's
good
of
you
to
check
on
him
well
it's
nice
to
be
able
to
help
someone
in
a
nonslaying
capacity
except
he's
starting
to
get
that
look
you
know
like
he's
gonna
ask
me
to
prom
well
it
would
probably
be
good
for
his
selfesteem
if
you
oh
come
on
what
am
i
saint
buffy
he's
like
three
feet
tall
i'm
glad
to
see
you've
recovered
from
your
psychic
encounter
more
or
less
intact
feel
up
to
some
training
sure
we
can
work
out
after
school
you
know
if
you're
not
too
busy
having
sex
with
my
mother
