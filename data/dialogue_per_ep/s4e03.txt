the
best
kind
well
my
father

it
up
that
stuff
oh
bad
bad
buffy

i'm
okay
to
talk
about
it
now
and
i'm
not
doing
to
deep
get
sympathy
routine
i
mean
don't
you
just
hate
guys
that
are
all
'i'm
dark
and
brooding
so
give
me
love'
i
don't
think
i've
ever
met
that
type
i
just
wanted
to
say
that
it
was
so
sad
cause
there
was
well
a
lot
of
stuff
that
he
didn't
finish
it
make
me
think
about
you
know
living
for
now
i
think
about
that
sometimes
i
sort
of
drowned
a
couple
years
ago
but
i
came
back
obviously
but
i
don't
i
don't
put
stuff
off
anymore
like
you
were
saying
that's
great
i
mean
everybody
says
they
get
it
'oh
man
me
too
live
for
today'
but
what
they
really
what
is
a
reason
to
goof
off
not
study
for
finals
also
a
valid
life
choice
it's
cool
to
find
someone
else
who
understands
so
parker
abrams
when
you
go
to
sleep
tonight
what
are
you
going
to
regret
not
doing
today
i'm
going
to
regret
being
too
nervous
to
ask
you
to
go
to
the
party
at
wolfhouse
tomorrow
night
do
you
want
to
go
to
the
party

yes
i
am
not
enjoying
this
well
shelve
them
correctly
and
we
can
finish
i
don't
get
your
crazy
system
system
it's
called
the
alphabet
huh
would
you
look
at
that
you
should
lock
your
door
believe
me
i'm
kicking
myself
anya
last
time
i
saw
you
fleeing
in
terror

talk
to
xander

my
dreams

all
naked
really
you
know
if
i'm
in
the
checkout
line
at
the
walmart

had
the
same
one

can
assume
a
standing
friday
night
date
and
a
mutual
recognition
as
prom
night
as
our
dating
anniversary
anya
slow
down
there
in
fact
come
to
a
screeching
halt
see
these
things
kind
of
have
to
develop
on
their
own
okay
how
i
don't
know
i
just
happens
this
is
it
the
door
wood
maybe
some
kind
of
wood
veneer

mad
'my

'my
boyfriend'
well
if
you
believe
her
she
always
lied
about
stuff
like
that
'oh
he
goes
to
another
school
you
wouldn't
know
him'
well
devon
dated
her
for
a
while
but
she
was
too
flaky
for
him
which
stop
and
marvel
at
the
concept
guy
dating
harmony
dead
must
be
like
the
most
tolerant
guy
in
the
world
hi
baby
i'm
back
it's
definitely
the
crypt
right
i'm
not
keen
on
tunneling
into
someone's
septic
tank
it's
the
crypt
the
radar
soundings
are
clear
the
walls
are
thinnest
here
at
the
bottom
we'll
have
to
tunnel
underneath
more
work
but
i'm
sure

you'd
better
be
more
than
sure
cause
i'd
hate
to
have
to
hurt
you
i
swear
i
swear
how's
my
little
blondie
bear
harm
does
this
look
like
a
good
time
are
you
gonna
kill
willow
tonight
cause
i
want
you
to
say
'this
is
for
messing
with
my
sweet
girl'
and
then
you
know
nobody
knows
i'm
here
and
i'm
not
killing
the
slayer's
best
friend
because
that
would
tend
to
announce
my
presence
and
we're
too
bloody
close
but
you
almost
killed
her
last
year
suddenly
it's
a
big

had
a
math
class

last

no
old

let's
have
a
meaningful
talk
instead
spike
and
harmony
buffy
hi
what
a
cute
outfit
last
year
well
this
is
interesting
sort
of
a
double
date
looks
like
your
friend
started
the
party
a
little
early
huh
so
let's
have
a
look
at
the
new
boy
hi
i'm
parker
he's
got
what's
the
word
vulnerability
and
you
with
harmony
what'd
you
do
loose
a
bet
hey
actually
how
we
met
it's
a
funny
story
stay
here
what's
the
matter
spike
dru
dump
you
again
maybe
i
left
her
she
left
him
for
a
fungus
demon
that's
all
he
talks
about
most
days
harm
we
are
going
it
isn't
time
yet
yeah
but
as
soon
as
we
have
the
gem
of
amara
you're
gonna
be
sorr
argh
what
ow
come
in
anya
hi
again
you're
mother
sent
me
around
from
the
front
of
the
house
she
said
to
ask
you
to
add
fabric
softener
when
the
timer
goes
off
can
we
talk
some
more
yeah
i
suppose
would
you
like
something
i
have
cranapple
yeah
alright
you
know
it
is
customary
to
call
before
you
show
up
not
that

yeah
spike
with
harmony
if
you
can
believe
it
i
couldn't
figure
out
why
he
ran
away
but
harmony
said
something
why
they
were
here
they
were
looking
for
the
gem
of
something
amara
the
gem
of
amara
are
you
sure
yeah
what's
up
uh
oh
it's
just
uh
it's
not
real
it's
uh
the
vampire
equivalent
of
the
holy
grail
the
source
of
some
enormous
power
was
conveniently
vague
oh
here
it
is
yes
there
was
a
great
deal
of
vampiric
interest
in
locating
it
during
the
uh
oh
the
10th
century
questing
vampires
combed
the
earth
but
no
one
ever
found
anything
it
was
concluded
that
it
never
existed
well
spike
seems
to
think
it
exists
and
he's
looking
in
sunnydale
yes
well
i'll
research
it
as
best
i
can
you've
done
all
you
can
for
tonight
why
don't
you
go
to
bed
uh
huh
sleepy
yawn
bye
is
antonio
banderas
a
vampire
no
can
i
make
him
a
vampire
no
on
second
thought
yes
go
do
that
take
your
time
do
melanie
and
the
kids
as
well
hey
i
don't
have
a
pulse
cool
hey
can
we
eat
a
doctor
so
we
can
get
a
stethoscope
and
hear
my
heart
not
beating
harm
will
you
shut
the
hell
up
and
if
my
hearts
no
beating
what
are
these
blue
veins
for
i'm
simply
covered
in
these
blue
veins
see
i've
got
an
extra
set
of
chains
just
because
dorkus
went
in
for
that

druscilla
say
her
name
dorkus
bite
your
tongue
do
it
for
me
at
point
the
matter
is
brought
to
a
conclusion
with
both
parties
satisfied
and
able
to
move
on
with
their
separate
lives
and
interests
to
sum
up
i
think
it's
a
workable
plan
so
the
crux
of
this
plan
is

sexual
intercourse
i've
said
it
like
a
dozen
times
uh
huh
just
working
through
a
little
hysterical
deafness
here
i
think
it's
the
secret
to
getting
you
out
of
my
mind
putting
you
behind
me
behind
me
figuratively
i'm
thinking
face
to
face
for
the
actual
event
itself
ah
right
it's
just
we
hardly
know
each
other
i
mean
i
like
you
and
you
have
a
certain
directness
that
i
admire
but
sexual
interc
what
you're
talking
about
welland
i'm
actually
turning
into
a
woman
as
i
say
thisbut
it's
about
expressing
something
and
accepting
consequences
oh
i
have
condoms
some
are
black
that's
that's
very
considerate
i
like
you
you're
funny
and
you're
nicely
shaped
and
frankly
it's
ludicrous
to
have
these
interlocking
bodies
and
not
interlock
please
remove
your
clothing
now
and
the
amazing
thing
still
more
romantic
than
faith
fabric
softener
parker
i
was
afraid
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
find
you
i
was
getting
a
little
worried
i'm
so
sorry
it's
just
that
the
english
guy
is
an
old
friend
and
he's
not
supposed
to
drink
and
i
saw
him
here
in
the
land
of
the
beer

it's
okay
you
did
a
good
thing
for
your
friend
did
uh
you
and
he
used
to
go
out
um
no
no
we
really
really
didn't
good
now
we
have
time
to
make
up
for
think
i
could
get
a
dance
with
the
prettiest
girl
at
the
party
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
stand
over
here
and
watch
well
i
declared
premed
but
i
hated
it
so
i
switched
to
history
history
fascinating
dates
and
compelling
faces
but
there
something
amazing
about
these
huge
events
that
when
you
dig
down
into
them
they're
just
about
regular
people
trying
to
make
choices
when
you
look
back
at
it
seems
like
people
were
swept
up
in
events
they
couldn't
control
but
i
don't
believe
that
i
believe
you
have
a
choice
in
everything
you
do
is
this
okay
because
i
can
stop
if
you
wanna
it's
your
choice
what
are
you
doing
making
a
choice
buffy
are
you
there
call
me
i
need
to
talk
to
you
right
away
parker
just
shirt
pants
everybody
needs
pants
hey
you're
up
you're
here
i
live
here
oh
i
just
didn't
know
where
you
were
it
looked
like
you
were
going
to
be
out
for
a
while
so
i
ran
for
coffee
better
than
what
i
got
around
here
warm
soda
and
breath
mints
breath
mints
wouldn't
be
turning
them
down
right
now
so
do
you
have
any
plans
for
today
actually
my
mom's
coming
to
visit
oh
well
i'll
just
clear
out
then
but
maybe
we
could
um
talk
or
something
later
absolutely
i'll
give
you
a
call
great
oh
uh
one
more
thing
before
i
go
a
kiss

was
going

a
kiss
is
good
too
so
i'm
over

text
it
refers
to
the
gem
of
amara
as
residing
in
the
valley
of
the
sun
demon
fancy
talk
for
sunnydale
it
seems
that
spike
may
know
what
it's
about
the
gem
may
exist
after
all
in
sunnydale
in
a
sealed
underground
crypt
why
don't
you

try
and
locate
the
crypt

i'll
try
to
find
spike
before
he
gets
there
i'll
get
started
i'll
go
call
xander

have
him
meet
at
your
place

i
take
stuff
take
whatever
you
want
i
don't
care
eww
like
you're
too
good
to
work
a
clasp
so
is
it
doing
it
do
you
feel
it
i
mean
you
don't
look
different
if
you
were
wondering
i
thought
maybe
you'd
look
taller
or
glow
or
something
hmm
you
should
put
some
butter
on
that
but
hey
maybe
it's
worth
money
anyway
that
would
be
something
then
we
could
go
to
france
i
always
wanted
to
go
to
france
and
stay
in
a
chateau
and
you
could
take
me
shopping

i
can't
believe
you
just
did
that
hold
on
what
are
you
doing
you
big
freak
that's
my
gem
fine
if
that's
all
that
matters
to
you
then
take
it
take
it
take
it
and
get
out
that's
a
good
idea
i
think
i'll
go
wait
outside
okay
either
i'm
borrowing
all
your
albums
or
i'm
moving
in
oz
there
are
more
important
things
than
records
right
now
more
important
than
this
one
well
i
suppose
an
argument
could
be
made
for

whoa
giles
has
a
tv
everybody
giles
has
a
tv
he's
shallow
like
us
i
got
to
admit
i'm
a
little
disappointed
i
ah

well
maybe
it
doesn't
work
like
a
piece
of
art
public
television

on
everyone

have
vital
work
to
do
watching
television

help
us
right
now
near
the
uc
sunnydale

the
unusual
occurrence

in
the

i
do
something
wrong
something
wrong
no
of
course
not
it
was
fun
didn't
you
have
fun
watch
out
how
you
answer
that
my
ego
is
fragile
you
had
fun
was
that
all
it
was
what
else
was
it
supposed
to
be
it
seemed
like
you
liked
me
i
do
but
i'm
starting
to
feel
like
you
felt
what
some
kind
of
commitment
are
you
sure
that's
what
you
want
right
now
i
just
thought
i'm
sorry
if
you
missed
something
i
thought
things
were
pretty
clear
i'm
sorry
if
i
miss
i'm
sorry
look
i
really
have
to
go
now
parker
wait
i
did
this
all
wrong
no
it's
cool
we'll
hook
up
later
wow
that
was
pathetic
birds
singing
squirrels
making
lots
of
rotten
little
squirrels
sun
beaming
down
in
a
nice
nonfatal
way
it's
very
exciting
i
can't
wait
to
see
if
i
freckle
oh
do
it
again
it
tickles
you
know
in
a
good
way
the
gem
of
amara
official
sponsor
of
my
killing
you
being
a
vampire
sucks
buffy
buffy
xander
i
was
looking
for
you
you
weren't
in
your
musty
basement
have
you
seen
buffy
no
about
what
happened
i
said
i
was
over
you

anya
i
don't
have
time
harmony
where's
spike
has
he
had
the
gem
he
staked
me
then
he
took
it
he
tried
to
take
it
right
off
my
finger
like
i
wouldn't
have
just
given
it
to
him
i
would
have
given
him
anything
he
wanted
he
was
my
platinum
baby
and
i
loved
him
where
did
spike
go
getting
tired
slayer
xander
get
out
of
here
so
you
let
parker
take
a
poke
eh
didn't
seem
like
you
know
each
other
that
well
what
did
it
take
to
pry
apart
the
slayer's
dimpled
knees
you're
a
pig
spike
did
he
play
the
sensitive
lad
and
get
you
to
seduce
him
that's
a
good
trick
if
the
girls
thick
enough
to
buy
it
i
wonder
what
went
wrong
were
you
too
strong
did
you
bruise
the
boy
come
to
think
of
it
seems
like
someone
told
me
that
who
was
it
oh
yeah
angel
take
it
off
me
this
way
we
both
burn
really
let's
see
i
like
it
it's
small
really
worth
getting
my
ribs
bashed
in
it's
also
very
dangerous
and
we're
destroying
it
we
don't
destroy
it
well
buffy
any
vampire
that
gets
his
hand
on
this
is
going
to
be
essentially
unlikable
oh
i
have
that
gig
in
la
i
could
swing
by
thanks
oz
what's
going
on
what's
in
la
she's
giving
the
ring
to
angel
don't
make
a
fuss
buffy
are
you
sure
he
should
have
it
so
what
i'm
wondering
is
does
this
always
happen
sleep
with
a
guy
and
he
goes
all
evil
god
i'm
such
a
fool
well
maybe
you
made
a
mistake
but
that's
okay
next
time
what
parker
said
it's
okay
to
make
mistakes
it
was
sweet
no
it
wasn't
he
was
saying
that
so
you
would
take
a
chance
and
sleep
with
him
he's
a
poop
head
you're
right
he's
manipulative
and
shallow
and
why
doesn't
he
want
me
am
i
repulsive
if
there
was
something
repulsive
about
me
you
would
tell
me
right
i'm
your
friend
i
would
call
you
repulsive
in
a
second
maybe
parker
and
i
could
still
work
it
out
do
you
think
we
could
still
work
it
out
i
think
you're
missing
something
about
this
whole
poop
head
principal
i
think
i'm
gonna
take
a
walk
you
go
on
ahead
you
sure
yeah
