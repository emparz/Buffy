so
this
is
what
it
is
talking
about
communication
talking
about
language
not
the
same
thing
it's
about
inspiration
not
the
idea
but
the
moment
before
the
idea
when
its
total
when
it
blossoms
in
your
mind
and
connects
to
everything
it's
about
the
thoughts
and
experiences

when
you
were
a
child
oh
alright
nothing
else
well
iit
could
definitely
be
one
of
your
prophetic
dreams

be
the
eternal
mystery
that
is
your
brain
but

check
it
out
and
um
i'll
let
you

of
a
group
called
the
gentlemen
group
of
what
the
gentlemen
dunno
you
certain
no
we're
out
of
wheatabits
we
are
out
of
wheatabits
because
you
ate
it
all
again
get
some
more
i
thought
vampires
were
supposed
to
eat
blood
yep
well
sometimes
i
like
to
crumble
up
the
wheatabits
in
the
blood
give
it
a
little
texture
since
the
picture
you
just
painted
means
i
will
never
touch
food
of
any
kind
again
you'll
just
have
to
pick
it
up
yourself
sissy
i
don't
get
what
this
is
coming
from
well
what
am
i
supposed
to
think
well
how
could
you
say
i'm
using
you
you
don't
care
about
what
i
think
you
don't
ask
about
my
day
you
really
did
turn
into
a
real
girl
didn't
you
see
you
make
jokes
during
my
pain
you
don't
care
about
me
at
all
i
care
about
you
how
much
what
do
i
mean
to
you
i
we
you
know
we
spend
we'll
talk
about
it
later
well
i
think
we
should
talk
about
it
now
thank
you
for
knocking
if
you
don't
know
how
i
feel
about
i
don't
this
isn't
a
relationship
you
don't
need
me
all
you
care
about
is
lots
of
orgasms
ok
remember
how
we
talked
about
private
conversations
and
how
they're
less
private
when
they're
in
front
of
my
friends
oh
we're
not
your
friends
go
on
please
don't
this
is
important
but
why
is
it
here
mom
said
you
wanted
me
to
swing
by
oh
oh
yes
well
i
meant
uh
after
sunset
um
i
need
you
to
take
spike
for
a
few
days
what
what
what
i'm
not
staying
with
him
i
have
a
friend
who's
coming
to
town
and
i'd
like
us
to
be
alone
oh
you
mean
an
orgasm
friend
yes
that's
exactly
the
most
appalling
thing
you
could
have
said
he's
not
roaming
around
he
stays
with
me
he's
gonna
get
tied
up
again
what
about
us
our
romantic
evening
i'm
not
having
these
two
shag
while
i'm
tied
to
a
chair
three
feet
away
that's
not
exactly
one
of
my
fantasies
either
so
you're
blowing
off
our
evening
because
i
don't
want
him
to
come
either
we
come
together
daughters
of
gaia
sisters
to
the
moon
we
walk
with
the
darkness
the
wolf
at
our
side
through
the
waterfall
of
power
to
the
blackest
heart
of
eternity
i
think
we
should
have
a
bake
sale
i
don't
know
you
guys
like
a
bake
sale
right
i
mean
we
need
money
for
the
dance
recital
and
you
know
i
do
an
empowering
lemon
bundt
the
most
important
thing
is
the
gaian
newsletter
we
need
to
get
the
message
of
blessing
out
to
the
sisters
also
who
left
their
scented
candles
dripping
all
over
my
women
power
shrine
like
what
well
there's
the
wacky
notion
of
spells
you
know
conjuring
transmutation
oh
yeah
then
we
could
all
get
on
our
broomsticks
and
fly
around
on
our
broomsticks
you
know
certain
stereotypes
are
not
very
empowering
i
think
that
one
person's
energy
can
suck
the
power
from
an
entire
circle
no
offense
well
maybe
we
could
uh
yeah
tara
guys
quiet
do
you
have
a
suggestion
ok
let's
talk
about
the
theme
for
the
bacchanal
so
not
stellar
huh
talk
all
talk
blah
blah
gaia
blah
blah
moon
menstrual
lifeforce
power
thingy
you
know
after
a
couple
of
sessions
i
was
hoping
we
would
get
into
something
real
but
no
actual
witches
in
your
witch
group
no
bunch
of
wanna
blessed
bees
you
know
nowadays

girl
with
a
henna
tattoo
and
a
spice
rack
thinks
she's
a
sister
to
the
dark
ones
well
i'm
sorry
it
was
a
bust
i
know
you
were
looking
to
go
farther

that
department

just
like
to
float
something
bigger
than
a
pencil

it
bugs
me
this
time

is
the
burden

cool

clark

our
way

help
maintain
order
we
will
find
an
answer
are
you

the
gentlemen
they
are
fairy
tale
monsters

a
spellmake
people
talk
again
i'i'd
seen
you
in
the
group
the
wicca
group
you
were
you
were
different
than
them
i
mean
they
didn't
seem
to
know
what
they
were
talking
about
i
think
if
they
saw
a
witch
they
would
run
the
other
way
how
long
have
you
been
practicing
always
i
mean
since
i
um
was
little
my
my
mom
used
to
she
um
she
had
a
lot
of
power
like
you
oh
i'm
not
i
don't
have
much
in
the
way
of
power
really
i
mean
most
of
my
potions
come
out
soup
besides
spells
going
awry
friends
in
danger
i'm
definitely
nothing
special
no
you
are
so
would
you
say
this
was
uh
your
best
visit
ever
all
the
time
you
used
to
talk
to
me
about
witchcraft
and
darkness
and
the
likei
just
thought
you
were
being
pretentious
oh
i
was
i
was
also
right
so
everything
you
told
me
was
true
well
no
um
i
wasn't
actually
one
of
the
original
members
of
pink
floyd
but
the
monster
stuff
yes
