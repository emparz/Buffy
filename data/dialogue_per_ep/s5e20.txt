buffy
we
have
to
keep
moving
i
can't
i
really
hate
it
when
people
touch
my
things
last
words
slayrunt
just
one
truckglory
looks
to
her
right
too
late
as
a
huge
semi
smashes
into
her
no
not
now
you
idiot
let
go
of
my
body
oh
god
aand
then
whoosh
all
of
a
sudden
glory's
standing
right
there
in
front
of
us
all
skanky
and
blonde
and
thinkin'
she's
all
that
just
'cause
some
bumpy
heads
kiss
her
stinky
feet

she
does
have
nice
feet
aand
she's
comin'
right
at
us
and
buffy's
just
standing
there
not
even
blinking
like
bring
it
on
and
then
wham
hellbitch
in
orbit
go
buff
i
knew
you'd
best
glory
eventually
i
mean
allall
our
years
of
training
a
truck
hit
her
oh
you
threw
it
at
her
well
no
she
more
kind
of
waited
for
it
to
hit
glory
uh
but
then
buffy
ran
really
fast
and
we
got
away
i
don't
know
how
we
got
away
that
truck
couldn't
have
slowed
her
down
for
more
than
a
second
well
how
isn't
important
all
that
matters
is
that
the
two
of
you
are
safe
safe
we've
barely
been
able
to
manage
not
getting
seriously
dead
every
time
we've
crossed
paths
with
glory
now
that
she
knows
that
dawn
is
the
key
there
must
be
something
in
the
book
of
tarnis
that
we've
missed
something
we
can
use
against
glory
piano
because
that's
what
we
used
to
kill
that
big
demon
that
one
time
no
wait
thatthat
was
a
rocket
launcher
ahn
what
are
you
talking
about
we
should
drop
a
piano
on
her
well
it
always
works
for
that
creepy
cartoon
rabbit
when
he's
running
from
that
nice
man
with
the
speech
impediment
yes
or
perhaps
we
could
paint
a
convincing
tunnel
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
let's
just
keep
thinking
everyone
perhaps
we
should
reassemble
at
the
magic
shop
see
if
there's
anything
we
can't
fight
her
wwell
not
yet
no
but
no
not
ever
she's
too
strong
giles
we're
not
gonna
win
this
with
with
stakes
or
spells
or
pulling
out
some
uranium
power
core
she's
a
god
and
she's
coming
for
us
so
let's
just
not
be
here
when
she
starts
knocking
run
away
finally
a
sensible
plan
that's
not
what
she
meant
is
it
well
we
can't
stay
here
she'll
just
kill
us
off
one
by
one
until
there's
no
one
left
standing
between
her
and
dawn
buffy
we
all
understand
the
severity
of
the
situation
but
there
must
be
another
way
no
we
stay
we
die
show
of
hands
for
that
option
all
right
nobody
goes
home
nobody
tells
anybody
we're
leaving
just
pack
up
whatever
supplies
we
need
and
that's
it
we're
gone
cool
don't
have
to
study
for
that
geometry
test
what
about
wheels
i
don't
think
everybody's
gonna
fit
in
the
xandermobile
just
get
your
stuff
together
i'll
handle
the
rest
this
is
this
is
terrible
i'll
never
be
able
to
mend
this
not
really
my
color
anyway
oh
yes
inappropriate
humor
most
amusing
don't
suppose
you
know
what
led
to
this
sartorial
tragedy
that's
not
how
it
works
you
know
that
yes
of
course
i
just
thought
maybe
after
her
magnificent
incandescence
was
returned
to
this
manly
and

painfully
handsome
assemblage
you
might
have
noticed
something
interesting
a
key
in
human
form
perhaps
lounging
about
unattended
if
i
did
do
you
really
think
i
would
tell
you
why
do
you
insist
on
fighting
the
inevitable
no
one
can
stand
against
her
blindingly
scrumptious
luminescence
glory
her
name
is
glory
and
she's
your
god
you
little
scab
not
mine
with
all
due
respect
andand
fear
of
sharp
objects
you
exist
sir
only
because
of
her
divine
greatness
you
mean
her
divine
failure
don't
you
i
didn't
ask
for
any
of
this
i
just
want
to
be
normal
we
play
the
hand
we're
dealt
nothing's
mine
is
it
this
life
this
body
it's
all
infected
the
only
thing
i
ever
cared
about
she's
taken
away
from
me
you
know
why
i
wanted
to
be
a
doctor
flattering
drawstring
pants
to
be
close
to
people
to
witness
their
lives
and
their
deaths
to
be
there
alongside
them
a
part
of
everyday
humanity
maybe
it's
the
drugs
drugs
sir
find
the
right
combination
keep
her
buried
where
she
belongs
impossible
her
magnificence
can
never
be
fully
contained
she
is
a
perfect
allencompassing
light
one
you
should
feel
honored
to
be
bathed
in
oh
yeah
i'm
thrilled
especially
with
the
part
where
she
gets
her
key
back
and
i
cease
to
exist
true
this
ohsoappealing
form
will
of
necessity
be
shrugged
off
not
if
i
get
the
key
first
and
if
you
did
what
then
could
you
do
it
take
a
human
life
with
your
own
hands
oblivion
is
such
a
small
inconvenience
in
the
service
of
a
deity
accept
your
fate
i
mean
you
said
it
yourself
this
life
was
never
really
yours
anyway
was
it
it
doesn't
matter
how
i
came
by
it
it's
mine
and
i
plan
on
keeping
it
anybody
else
feel
that
what
cold
draft
of
paralyzing
fear
we
just
need
to
stay
calm
calm
right
hey
we
gotta
be
like
sergeant
rock
cool
and
collected
in
the
face
of
overwhelming
odds
overwhelming
how
much
more
than
whelming
would
that
be
exactly
look
everything
will
be
all
right
we
just
need
to
stay
here
calmly
as
soon
as
buffy
arrives
we'll
feel
oddly
worse
what's
he
doing
here
just
out
for
a
jaunt
thought
i'd
swing
by
and
say
howdy
out
he's
here
because
we
need
him
the
hell
we
do
if
glory
finds
us
he's
the
only
one
besides
me
that
has
any
chance
of
protecting
dawn
buffy
come
on
look
this
isn't
a
discussion
he
stays
get
over
it
buckle
up
kids
daddy's
puttin'
the
hammer
down
sign
here
okay
that
should
do
it
see
did
i
not
tell
you

easy
it
would
be
for
us

trees

what
orlando
says

this
now
shouldn't
somebody
be
asking
are
we
there

small
entertaining
children

that
kinda
only
works
if
you
know
where
you're
going
do
we
know
where
we're
going
yet
we'd
already
be
somewhere
if
captain
slowpoke
would
give
up
the
wheel

it
step
on
what
i've
driven
tricycles

point
in
a
confrontation
spike

prove
useful
i
don't
know
if
buffy's
thinkin'
too
clear
on
that
one
or
anything
else
right
now
i've
never
seen
her
so
she's
been
through
more
than
her
fair
share
of
late
she
just
needs
a
chance
to
catch
her
breath
regroup
she'll
be
all
right
yeah
she'll

yeah
any
luck
uh
if
you
define
luck
as
the
absence
of
success
plenty
there's
a
couple
barrier
spells
but
they
only
work
on
a
fixed
locus
haven't
found
anything
that'll
work
while
we're
still
moving
so
pretty
can
i
have
one
come
on
anyone
hungry
ooh

any
successful
migration

let's
move
come
on

it
buffy
it's
clear
the
key
enemies
fly
and
fall
circling
arms
raise
a
wall
they
have
the
general
clerics
energy
barrier
a
most
powerful
one
can
it
be
breached
the
witch's
magic
pales
to
the
might
of
our
god
the
infidels'
wall
shall
tumble
before
us
will
how
long
will
it
hold
half
a
day
maybe
or
till
heckle
and
jeckle
punch
a
hole
through
it
so
what's
the
story
with
these
roleplaying
rejects
let's
find
out
you
sure
scarface
here
can
habla
the
english
he
understands
me
don't
you
you
were
warned
we
would
return
slayer
took
you
long
enough
what
are
you
supposed
to
be
some
kind
of
chief
general
general
in
charge
of
what
getting
captured
you
do
not
frighten
me
child
the
instrument
of
chaos
must
be
destroyed
look
at
her
that
way
again
and
she
will
be
the
last
thing
you
ever
see
as
i've
been
told
you
protect
the
key
of
the
beast
it's
not
that
simple
yes
the
key
has
been
transformed
given
breath
life
yet
this
makes
no
difference
the
key
is
the
link
the
link
must
be
severed
such
is
the
will
of
god
she
doesn't
remember
anything
about
being
this
key
you're
all
looking
for
the
only
thing
that
she
remembers
is
growing
up
with
a
mother
and
a
sister
that
love
her
what
kind
of
god
would
demand
her
life
for
something
that
she
has
no
control
over
we
are
not
your
enemy
tell
your
men
to
stand
down
no
it
is
not
her
fault
she's
human
now
the
key
is
too
dangerous
to
be
allowed
to
exist
no
matter
what
form
it
has
been
pressed
into
i
will
not
let
anyone
tell
me
shh
shh
shh
what
happened
ii
don't
know
she
just
went
nuts
time
time
time
tara
we
have
to
do
something
she
she
can't
stay
this
way
buffy
time
time
time
time
time
no
it's
not
time
for
your
meds
just
lie
back
doctor
doctor
mccarthy
it's
time
it's
time
no
no
shh
there's
nothing
to
fear
my
brother
the
beast
may
have
taken
your
mind
but
i
swear
to
you
she
will
never
know
the
taste
of
your
heart
clerics
i
want
the
witch's
barrier
down
now
i'm
sorry
for
what
we
should
have
stayed
if
we
had
none
of
this
would
have
happened
don't
what
you
did
wwas
necessary
what
i've
always
admired
running
away
being
able
to
place
your
heart
above
all
else
i'm
so
proud
of
you
you've
come
so
far
you're
everything
a
watcher
everything
i
could
have
hoped
for
willow
open
a
door
speak
one
of
my
friends
was
hurt
when
you
attacked
us
and
ten
of
my
men
are
dead
honorable
men
shall
we
balance
the
scale
will
you
let
someone
come
and
help
him
or
not
give
quarter
to
an
agent
of
the
beast
what
madness
would
move
me
to
such
action
i'm
done
asking
whoa
whoa
hey
uh
this
is
war
isn't
it
and
if
there's
one
thing
i've
learned
from
sergeant
rock
it
is
in
war
there
are
rules
or
at
least
there
should
be
if
you're
as
honorable
as
you
think
you
are
plus
we
do
have
your
general
forehead
guy
discharge
and
bring
life
handier
than
a
swiss
knife
look
the
door
to
my
crypt's
got
this
nasty
squeak
maybe
you
could
hey
uh
iit's
buffy
i
need
to
ask
you
a
really
big
favor

i'll
take
what
i
can
get
thank
you
for
coming
my
pleasure

think
i
got
him
stabilized
but
there's
a
lot
of
damage
we
need
to
get
him
out
of
here
well
i
think
the
guys
with
the
pointy
swords
kinda
have
other
ideas
don't
they
always
look
i
know
this
must
seem
extra
outer
limits
to
you
this
naah
i've
seen
things
you
wouldn't
believe
you
know
emergency
room
full
moon
on
a
saturday
night
look
if
this
gets
too
weird
just
tell
me
i'll
understand
don't
worry
about
me
i
won't
leave
until
i've
worn
out
my
welcome
ow
thanks
you
know
those
things'll
kill
you
oh
right
i
mention
today
how
much
i
don't
like
you
you
mighta
let
it
slip
in

once
or
twice
how're
your
feelers
nothing
compared
to
the
little
bits
we're
gonna
get
chopped
into
when
the
renaissance
faire
kicks
the
door
in
and
here
we
bloody
sit
it's
not
like
we
got
much
of
a
choice

make
a
break
for
it
use
general
armorall
as
a
shield
get
to
the
doc's
car
and
great
plan
and
while
all
the
hacking
and
slashing's
going
on
what
are
you
gonna
be
doing
huh
throwing
migraines
at
'em
look
we
stay
here
we
all
die
at
least
this
way
some
of
us
might
get
no
we're
all
gonna
make
it
i'm
not
losing
anyone
check
the
supplies
see
if
anyone's
hungry
dissention
in
the
ranks
seldom
a
harbinger
of
glad
tidings
shut
up
poor
frightened
girl
you've
no
idea
what
you've
gotten
yourself
into
why
don't
you
tell
me
would
it
make
a
difference
what
do
you
know
of
the
beast
strong
fast
hellgod
from
a
dimension
of
unspeakable
torment
a
demon
dimension
i
know
she
ruled
with
two
other
hellgods
right
along
with
the
beast
they
were
a
triumvirate
of
suffering
and
despair
ruling
with
equal
vengeance
but
the
beast's
power
grew
beyond
even
what
they
could
conceive
as
did
her
lust
for
pain
and
misery
they
looked
upon
her
what
she
had
become
and
trembled
a
god
afraid
such
was
her
power
they
feared
she
would
attempt
to
seize
their
dimension
for
herself
and
decided
to
strike
first
a
great
battle
erupted
in
the
end
they
stood
victorious
over
the
beast
barely
she
was
cast
out
banished
to
this
lower
plane
of
existence
forced
to
live
and
eventually
die
trapped
within
the
body
of
a
mortal
a
newborn
male
created
as
her
prison
that
is
the
beast's
only
weakness
kill
the
man
and
the
god
dies
unfortunately
the
identity
of
the
human
vessel
has
never
been
discovered
i
don't
understand
now
i've
seen
glory
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
the
hairy
chest
department
you
have
seen
a
glimpse
of
the
true
beast
her
power
was
too
great
to
be
completely
contained
she's
found
a
way
to
escape
her
mortal
prison
for
brief
periods
before
her
energies
are
exhausted
and
she's
forced
back
into
her
living
cell
of
meat
and
bone
what
about
me
what
about
the
key
dawn
i
want
to
know
the
key
is
almost
as
old
as
the
beast
itself
where
it
came
from
how
it
was
created
the
deepest
of
mysteries
all
that
is
certain
is
that
its
power
is
absolute
countless
generations
of
my
people
have
sacrificed
their
lives
in
search
of
it
to
destroy
it
before
its
wrath
could
be
unleashed
but
the
monks
found
it
first
yes
and
hid
it
with
their
magicks
why
didn't
they
just
destroy
it
if
the
key
is
as
dangerous
as
because
they
were
fools
they
thought
they
could
harness
its
power
for
the
forces
of
light
they
failed
and
paid
with
their
blood
what
do
i
do
what
was
i
created
for
you
were
created
to
open
the
gates
that
separate
dimensions
the
beast
will
use
your
power
to
return
home
and
seize
control
of
the
hell
she
was
banished
from
that's
it
that's
glory's
master
plan
to
go
home
you
misunderstand
once
the
key
is
activated
it
won't
just
open
the
gates
to
the
beast's
dimension
it's
going
to
open
all
the
gates
the
walls
separating
realities
will
crumble
dimensions
will
bleed
into
each
other
order
will
be
overthrown
and
the
universe
will
tumble
into
chaos
all
dark
forever
that
is
what
you
were
created
for
dawn
you
think
it's
true
what
he
said
i
don't
know
destroyer
of
the
universe
i
guess
cutting
school
doesn't
seem
so
bad
now
huh
it's
not
you
you
know
that
but
it's
in
me
isn't
it
it's
inside
me
what
are
we
gonna
do
i
won't
let
anything
happen
to
you
i
promise
wriggling
come
on
tara
you
have
to
eat
something
want
me
to
try
i
don't
know
i'm
gettin'
used
to
pickin'
fruit
out
of
my
hair
you
you
are
not
a
part
of
this
are
you
just
a
friend
of
the
family
would
you
die
for
them
because
that
is
what
your
future
holds
if
you
align
yourself
with
the
slayer
and
her
misguided
people
it's
my
life
and
i'll
do
what
i
please
with
it
it's
not
just
your
life
unimaginable
legions
will
perish
including
everyone
here
you
can
stop
this
you
can
save
all
their
lives
by
ending
one
the
little
girl
the
key
destroy
it
and
the
will
of
the
beast
will
be
broken
she
will
fade
a
distant
memory

and
all
of
this
madness
will
end
