we
go
now
live
to
our
field
reporter
who
is
standing
by
at
the
waterfront
with
this
breaking
news
about
the
murder
that
has
shocked
the
mayor
and
residents
of
sunnydale
fishermen
discovered
the
body
today
the
victim
of
a
brutal
stabbing
authorities
and
citizens
alike
were
shocked
when
the
slain
man
was
identified
as
deputy
mayor
allan
finch
still
reeling
from
the
news
mayor
wilkins
had
this
to
say
mr
finch
was
not
only
my
longtime
aide
and
associate
he
was
a
close
personal
friend
i
promise
you
i
will
not
rest
until
whoever
did
this
is
found
and
brought
to
justice
thank
you
very
much
oh
honey
you're
up
oh
it's
just
terrible
isn't
it
i
want
you
to
look
into
this
find
out
everything
you
can
about
the
murder
of
the
deputy
mayor
but
that's
ii
mean
that's
that's
not
really
our
jurisdiction
is
it
it's
no
big
b
we'll
get
into
it
if
he
wants
no
buffy's
right
the
deputy
mayor's
murder
was
the
result
of
human
malice
there's
nothing
supernatural
about
it
we
don't
know
that
for
certain
i
say
it
merits
investigation
which
i'm
sure
the
police
are
doing
meantime
if
you
ask
me
there
are
better
uses
for
the
slayers'
time

of
my
young

faith
what

right
there

when
this
whole
thing
went
down
anything
i
have
to
answer
for
you
do
too
you're
a
part
of
this
b
all
the
way
hey
hey
where's
faith
ii
saw
her
around
figured
you
two
were
gonna
go
kill
some
more
nasty
stuff
not
right
now
ii
um
i
think
she
bailed
willow
i
was
won
actually
i'm
um
you
go
ahead
i'm
late
ii'm
meeting
michael
the
warlock
guy
we're
still
trying
to
derat
amy
okay
so
see
ya
see
you
so
uh
you
heard
the
man
scream
about
what
time
last
night
oh
i'm
not
sure
700
maybe
800
can
you
be
more
specific
say
between
730
and
800
your
hand
oh
it's
okay
it's
not
working
it's
supposed
to
do
something
besides
shred
it's
supposed
to
cheer
me
up
usually
using
the
shredder
gives
me
a
lift
it's
fun
and
today
you're
not
getting
the
yayas
no
guess
it'll
take
more
than
this
to
turn
my
frown
upside
down
i
just
don't
understand
why
allan
would
leave
such
a
paper
trail
about
our
dealings
do
you
think
he
was
gonna
betray
me
oh
now
that's
a
horrible
thought
and
now
he's
dead
i'll
never
have
the
chance
to
scold
him
maybe
this
will
change
your
mood
what
is
it
bombshell
the
deputy
mayor
had
wooden
splinters
in
his
wound
why
do
you
think
he
talked
to
them
if
he
did
i'm
thinking
he
said
the
wrong
thing
well
this
is
exciting
a
slayer
up
for
murder
one
that's
sunshine
and
roses
to
me
it
really
is
i'm
telling
you
we
did
the
world
a
favor
this
guy
was
about
as
interesting
as
watching
paint
dry
faith
i'm
joking
jeez
lighten
up
a
little
b
he
came
out
of
nowhere
i
know
whatever
i'm
not
lookin'
to
hug
and
cry
and
learn
and
grow
i'm
just
saying
it
happened
quick
you
know
you
know
what
let's
just
blow
who
cares
what
this
guy
was
about
it's
kind
of
moot
now
don't
you
think
i
don't
think
he
was
in
that
alley
by
chance
i
think
he
was
looking
for
us
i'd
like
to
know
why
so
what
you
think
there's
some
big
conspiracy
you
were
saying
so
his
papers
are
gone
that
doesn't
prove
anything
except
that
somebody
didn't
want
us
to
prove
anything
get
as
many
men
on
it
as
you
can
yeah
we'll
be
wanting
to
turn
up
the
heat
so
the
mayor
of
sunnydale
is
a
black
hat
that's
a
shocker
huh
actually
yeah
i
didn't
get
the
bad
guy
vibe
off
of
him
when
are
you
gonna
learn
b
it
doesn't
matter
what
kind
of
vibe
you
get
off
a
person
'cause
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
face
they're
showing
you
is
not
the
real
one
i
guess
you
know
a
lot
about
that
what
is
that
supposed
to
mean
it's
just
look
at
you
faith
less
than
twentyfour
hours
ago
you
killed
a
man
aand
now
it's
all
zipadeedoodah
it's
not
your
real
face
and
i
know
it
look
i
know
what
you're
feeling
because
i'm
feeling
it
too
do
you
so
fill
me
in
'cause
i'd
like
to
hear
this
dirty
like
something
sick
creeped
inside
you
and
you
can't
get
it
out
and
you
keep
hoping
that
it
was
just
some
nightmare
but
it
wasn't
and
we
are
gonna
have
to
figure
out
is
there
gonna
be
an
intermission
in
this
just
let
me
talk
to
giles
okay
i
swear
no
we're
not
bringing
anybody
else
into
this
you
gotta
keep
your
head
b
this
is
all
gonna
blow
over
in
a
few
days
and
if
it
doesn't
if
it
doesn't
they
got
a
freighter
leaving
the
docks
at
least
twice
a
day
it
ain't
fancy
but
it
gets
you
gone
and
that's
it
you
just
live
with
it
you
see
the
dead
guy
in
your
head
every
day
for
the
rest
of
your
life
buffy
i'm
not
gonna
see
anything
i
missed
the
mark
last
night
and
i'm
sorry
about
the
guy
i
really
am
but
it
happens
anyway
how
many
people
do
you
think
we've
saved
by
now
thousands
and
didn't
you
stop
the
world
from
ending
because
in
my
book
that
puts
you
and
me
in
the
plus
column
we
help
people
it
doesn't
mean
we
can
do
whatever
we
want
why
not
the
guy
i
offed
was
no
gandhi
i
mean
we
just
saw
he
was
mixed
up
in
dirty
dealings
maybe
but
what
if
he
was
coming
to
us
for
help
what
if
he
was
you're
still
not
seeing
the
big
picture
b
something
made
us
different
we're
warriors
we're
built
to
kill
to
kill
demons
but
it
does
not
mean
that
we
get
to
pass
judgment
on
people
like
we're
better
than
everybody
else
we
are
better
that's
right
better
people
need
us
to
survive
i
am
well
that's
your
loss
buffy
tell
me
again
you
got
home
at
what
time
last
night
late
um
aa
little
past
100
i
guess
maybe
you
can
explain
to
me
what
a
girl
your
age
is
doing
out
all
night
just
hanging
hanging
by
yourself
no
i
was
with
my
friend
buffy
we
were
at
faith's
watching
tv
what
did
you
watch
some
old
movie
infomercial
hmm
that's
funny
'cause
i
got
a
couple
of
witnesses
who
put
you
near
the
alley
witnesses
somebody
stabbed
this
guy
through
the
heart
strange
thing
is
the
weapon
it
was
made
out
of
wood
stein
any
of
this
mean
anything
to
you
yeah
that
whoever
did
it
wasn't
hip
to
the
bronze
age
is
that
it
i'm
kinda
beat
yeah
i
have
enough
for
now
buffy
if
you
know
something
if
you're
protecting
someone
i
promise
you
it'll
be
better
for
everyone
if
you
just
come
clean
you
mean
am
i
covering
for
someone
hardly
i'm
not
the
throw
myselfonthesword
type
i
wish
i
could
help
you
well
call
me
if
you
remember
anything
hey
hey
i
need
to
talk
to
you
good
'cause
i've
been
letting
things
fester
and
i
don't
like
it
i
wanna
be
festerfree
yeah
me
too
i
mean
don't
get
me
wrong
ii
completely
understand
why
you
and
faith
have
been
doing
the
bonding
thing
you
guys
work
together
you
you
should
get
along
it's
more
complicated
than
that
but
see
it's
that
exact
thing
thatthat's
just
ticking
me
off
it's
this
whole
'slayers
only'
attitude
i
mean
since
when
wouldn't
i
understand
you
you
talk
to
me
about
everything
iit's
like
all
of
a
sudden
ii'm
not
cool
enough
for
you
because
i
can't
kill
things
with
my
bare
hands
oh
oh
buffy
don't
cry
i'm
sorry
ii
was
too
hard
on
you
sometimes
i
unleash
ii
don't
know
my
own
strength
iiit's
bad
iii'm
bad
i'm
a
bad
bad
bad
person
will
i'm
in
trouble
and
faith
acts
like
she
doesn't
even
care
the
way
she
talks
it's
like
she
didn't
even
make
a
mistake
do
you
think
she's
like
iin
shock
i
don't
know
and
i
think
that
detective
knows
more
than
he's
saying
i
think
he
knew
that
i
was
lying
you
have
to
go
to
giles
buffy
he'll
know
what
to
do
giles
buffy
uh
i
don't
really
know
how
to
say
this
so
i'm
i'm
i'm
just
gonna
say
it
i
know
i've
kept
things
from
you
before
but
but
um
but
ii've
been
blowing
off
my
classes
you
know
inin
the
sense
of
not
attending
and
uh
it's
okay
buffy
i
told
him
you
told
him
i
had
to
he
had
to
know
what
you
did
what
i
did
giles
no
thathat's
just
not
what
happened
i
don't
want
to
hear
it
buffy
no
it
i
don't
want
to
hear
any
more
lies
you
can't
be
serious
you're
setting
me
up
get
in
my
office
now
faith
i'll
talk
to
you
in
the
morning
giles
please
you
have
to
now
um
sorry
giles
i
didn't
do
this
i
swear
look
i
know
that
i
messed
up
badly
but
the
murder
iit
it
was
faith
i
know
she
may
have
many
talents
buffy
but
fortunately
lying
is
not
one
of
them
oh
oh
god
i
thought
i'm
sorry
i
needed
her
to
think
that
i
was
on
her
side
i
don't
know
how
far
she'll
take
this
charade
try
far
like
all
the
way
you
should
have
come
to
me
right
off
i
know
well
i
i
wanted
to
but
faith
wouldn't
hear
of
it
it's
not
all
her
fault
giles
we
both
thought
it
was
a
vampire
ii
only
realized
it
a
second
before
buffy
this
is
not
the
first
time
something
like
this
has
happened
it's
not
the
slayer
is
on
the
front
line
of
a
nightly
war
now
it's
it's
tragic
but
accidents
have
happened
wwhat
do
you
do
well
the
council
investigates
um
metes
out
punishment
if
punishment
is
due
but
i
i
have
no
plans
to
involve
them
i
mean
it's
the
last
thing
faith
needs
at
the
moment
she's
unstable
buffy
i
mean
she's
utterly
unable
to
accept
responsibility
she's
freaking
so
so
then
we
just
have
to
help
her
deal
right
she's
in
denial
there
is
no
help
for
her
until
she
admits
what
happened
ii
could
talk
to
her
perhaps
or
maybe
i'm
too
close
maybe
maybe
one
of
the
guys
could
we
should
meet
itit
may
be
that
they're
seeing
a
different
side
of
her
okay
in
the
meantime
no
one
else
is
to
know
understood
of
course
i
mean
this
is
extremely
delicate
if
we
scare
her
off
now
we
may
lose
her
forever
yes
hello
mr
travers
please
quentin
travers
well
maybe
we
should
all
talk
to
faith
together
you
mean
like
that
intervention
thing
that
you
guys
did
on
me
as
i
recall
xander
and
i
nearly
came
to
blows
uh
you
nearly
came
to
blows
buffy
i
nearly
came
to
loss
of
limbs
no
faith
is
too
defensive
for
a
confrontation
like
that
she'll
respond
better
to
a
oneonone
approach
well
i
can
be
the
one
on
her
one
let's
rephrase
i
think
she
might
listen
to
me
we
kind
of
have
um
a
connection
a
connection
why
would
you
think
that
i'm
just
saying
it's
worth
a
shot
that's
all
no
i
don't
i
don't
see
it
xander
i
mean
of
of
all
of
us
you're
the
one
person
arguably
that
faith
has
had
the
least
contact
with
yeah
but
we
hung
out
a
little
recently
and
she
seemed
to
be
um
responsive
when
did
you
guys
hang
out
oh
she
was
fighting
one
of
those
uh
apocalypse
demon
things
and
i
helped
her
gave
her
a
ride
home
and
you
guys
talked
not
extensively
no
then
why
would
you
oh
oh
i
don't
need
to
say
'oh'
i
got
it
before
they
slept
together
fine
fine
let's
let's
let's
move
on
alright
look
ii
know
that
you
mean
well
xander
but
um
ii
just
don't
see
faith
opening
up
to
you
she
doesn't
take
the
guys
that
she
has
a
'connection'
with
very
seriously
and
they're
they're
kind
of
a
big
joke
to
her
no
offense
oh
no
i
mean
why
would
i
be
offended
by
that
however
iif
you
still
want
to
be
of
assistance
i
i
i
need
some
help
with
research
there's
still
the
business
of
the
mayor
and
mr
trick
to
attend
to
yeah
they
they
seemed
pretty
cozy
the
other
night
yes
uh
willow
cccan
you
um
access
the
mayor's
files
what
oh
uh
sure
i
can
try
good
yes
because
clearly
we
uh
we
need
to
take
a
harder
look
at
him
he's
he's
um
he's
obviously
up
to
something
what
about
faith
i
don't
know
i
need
time
she
needs
help
now
i
owe
her
that
cut
to
the
girls'
bathroom
the
camera
pulls
in
to
a
stall
with
its
door
not
quite
closed
wish
we
never
met
by
kathleen
wilhoite
plays
over
the
scene
disappointment
stops
by
from
time
to
time
the
sound
of
sobbing
is
coming
from
inside
the
stall
cut
inside
willow
sits
there
crying
her
eyes
out
to
see
how
i'm
doing
and
he
came
by
last
night
right
after
you
left
my
life
in
ruin
cut
to
the
library
xander
sits
on
the
steps
to
the
stack
level
staring
off
into
space
and
tapping
his
fingers
when
i
don't
get
what
i
want
cut
to
faith's
room
she's
lying
on
her
bed
idly
watching
tv
the
spoiled
child
inside
breaks
down
she
hears
a
knock
at
her
door
she
rolls
off
her
bed
and
goes
to
answer
it
it's
xander
what
i
just
uh
came
by
to
see
how
you
are
actually
i'm
sick
of
people
asking
me
that
for
one
thing
can
i
come
in
just
to
talk
i
promise
like
you
could
make
something
happen
if
i
didn't
want
it
to
hey
yeah
got
me
there
pretty
much
not
gonna
try
to
take
you
under
any
circumstances
see
here
feel
that
probably
like
a
wet
noodle
to
you
huh
five
minutes
that's
all
i
need
for
talking
and
conversation
i'm
um
quick
as
a
bunny
clock
is
running
it's
just
uh
i
heard
about
what
happened
and
i
thought
you
might
need
a
friend
so
then
go
talk
to
buffy
she's
the
one
who
killed
a
guy
yeah
i
heard
that
version
version
either
way
iit
sounds
like
it
was
an
accident
and
that's
the
important
part
no
the
important
part
is
that
buffy
is
the
accidental
murderer
faith
you
may
not
think
so
but
i
sort
of
know
you
and
i've
seen
you
postbattle
and
i
know
firsthand
that
you're
um
like
a
wild
thing
and
half
the
time
you
don't
know
what
you're
doing
and
you're
living
proof
of
that
aren't
you
see
you're
trying
to
hurt
me
but
right
now
you
need
someone
on
your
side
what
happened
wasn't
your
fault
and
i'm
willing
to
testify
to
that
in
court
if
you
need
me
you'd
dig
that
wouldn't
you
to
get
up
in
front
of
all
your
geek
pals
and
go
on
record
about
how
i
made
you
my
boy
toy
for
a
night
no
nnnnno
that's
not
it
i
know
what
this
is
all
about
you
just
came
by
here
'cause
you
want
another
taste
don't
you
no
i
mean
it
was
nice
it
was
great
it
was
kind
of
a
blur
more
like
how
then
lights
on
or
off
faith
come
on
i
came
here
to
help
you
i
thought
we
had
a
connection
you
wanna
feel
a
connection
it's
just
skin
i
see
i
want
i
take
i
forget
no
no
wait
it
was
more
than
that
i
could
do
anything
to
you
right
now
and
you
want
me
to
i
can
make
you
scream
i
could
make
you
die
finally
decided
to
tie
me
up
huh
i
always
knew
you
weren't
really
a
oneslayer
guy
i'm
sorry
about
the
chains
it's
not
that
i
don't
trust
you
actually
it
is
that
i
don't
trust
you
the
thing
with
xander
i
know
what
it
looked
like
but
we
were
just
playing
and
he
forgot
the
safety
word
is
that
it
safety
words
are
for
wusses
i
bet
you're
not
big
on
trust
games
now
are
you
faith
you
gonna
shrink
me
now
is
that
it
no
i
just
wanna
talk
to
you
that's
what
they
all
say
and
then
it's
just
'lemme
stay
the
night
won't
try
anything'
angel
you
wanna
go
the
long
way
around
hey
i
can
do
that
i'm
not
getting
any
older
how's
she
doing
it's
like
talking
to
a
wall
only
you
get
more
from
a
wall
but
you'll
keep
trying
right
sure
we're
just
getting
started
so
what
do
i
do
look
right
now
there's
nothing
that
you
can
do
well
this
could
take
awhile
right
so
i'll
just
go
to
faith's
and
i'll
get
some
of
her
stuff
that
way
she'll
see
that
we're
on
her
side
that's
a
good
idea
okay
i'll
be
back
look
i
i
don't
want
you
to
get
your
hopes
up
buffy
she
may
not
want
us
to
help
her
she
does
she
just
doesn't
know
how
to
say
it
she
killed
a
man
that
changes
everything
for
her
giles
said
with
counseling
they
might
not
even
need
to
lock
her
up
that's
not
what
i
mean
she's
taken
a
life
i
know
she's
got
a
taste
for
it
now
not
one
slayer
but
two
right
here
in
the
building
there
was
supposed
to
be
a
guard
sh
here
comes
my
favorite
part
where
the
slayers
see
us
in
the
hall
together
thick
as
thieves
oh
wait
we
are
thieves
and
worse
and
now
they
know
it
well
they're
not
gonna
be
much
of
a
threat
in
jail
well
we
don't
have
near
enough
evidence
to
put
'em
away
no
you're
gonna
have
to
come
up
with
a
more
efficient
solution
and
mr
trick
you
better
think
of
it
soon
i
know
what's
goin'
on
with
you
join
the
club
everybody
seems
to
have
a
theory
hmm
but
i
know
what
it's
like
to
take
a
life
to
feel
a
future
a
world
of
possibilities
snuffed
out
by
your
own
hand
i
know
the
power
in
it
the
exhilaration
it
was
like
a
drug
for
me
yeah
sounds
like
you
need
some
help
a
professional
maybe
hmm
a
professional
couldn't
have
helped
me
it
stopped
when
i
got
my
soul
back
my
human
heart
goody
for
you
if
we're
gonna
party
let's
get
on
with
it
otherwise
could
you
let
me
out
of
these
things
faith
you
have
a
choice
you've
tasted
something
few
ever
do
i
mean
to
kill
without
remorse
is
to
feel
like
a
god
right
now
all
i
feel
is
a
cramp
in
my
wrist
so
let
me
go
but
you're
not
a
god
you're
not
much
more
than
a
child
going
down
this
path
will
ruin
you
you
can't
imagine
the
price
for
true
evil
yeah
i
hope
evil
takes
mastercard
you
and
me
faith
we're
a
lot
alike
time
was
i
thought
humans
existed
just
to
hurt
each
other
but
then
i
came
here
and
i
found
out
that
there
are
other
types
of
people
people
who
genuinely
wanted
to
do
right
and
they
make
mistakes
and
they
fall
down
you
know
but
they
keep
caring
what
by
the
order
of
the
watcher's
council
of
britain
i
am
exercising
my
authority
and
removing
you
to
england
where
you
will
accept
the
judgment
of
the
disciplinary
committee
i'm
sorry
for
the
extreme
measures
unfortunately
this
is
a
rather
extreme
circumstance
whatever
please
believe
nobody
is
rushing
to
judgment
the
first
priority
of
both
myself
and
the
council
is
to
help
you
ah
now
none
of
that
tighten
her
restraints
have
to
disagree
with
you
on
that
one
now
unlock
these
or
i'll
pop
this
guy's
head
like
a
grape
don't
even
think
about
it
faith
you
can't
keep
running
wrong
again
wes
it
was
the
new
watcher
he
had
a
couple
of
guys
helping
him
then
he
figured
it
out
which
means
that
faith
will
be
soon
on
her
way
back
to
england
to
face
the
watcher's
council
and
then
what
most
likely
they'll
lock
her
away
for
a
good
long
while
so
we
head
them
off
at
the
airport
and
stop
them
can
i
ii'm
just
wondering
why
i'm
not
the
most
objective
i
know
i
kind
of
have
an
issue
with
faith
sharing
my
people
but
she
murdered
someone
and
accused
buffy
then
she
hurt
xander
i
hate
to
say
it
but
maybe
she
belongs
behind
bars
she's
out
of
control
i
know
but
angel
was
getting
somewhere
with
her
she
was
opening
up
if
we
could
just
stop
wesley
that's
no
longer
an
issue
you
let
her
get
away
'let'
wouldn't
be
the
way
i'd
phrase
it
but
yes
she
escaped
that's
good
work
first
you
terrorize
her
then
you
put
her
back
in
the
streets
that
was
hardly
my
plan
i
was
trying
to
save
her
but
you
didn't
you
probably
destroyed
her
buffy
that's
enough
i
better
find
her
before
she
does
any
more
damage
we're
gonna
need
to
split
up
i'll
check
the
docks
that's
probably
where
she
is
giles
why
don't
you
go
to
her
motel
xander
willow
her
haunts
and
be
careful
i'll
try
the
airport
what
can
i
do
i
want
to
help
you
still
got
your
ticket
back
to
the
mother
country
you
don't
give
up
do
you
not
on
my
friends
no
yeah
because
you
and
me
are
such
solid
buds
right
we
could
be
it's
not
too
late
for
me
to
change
and
be
more
like
you
you
mean
faith
nobody
is
asking
you
to
be
like
me
but
you
can't
go
on
like
this
scares
you
doesn't
it
yeah
it
scares
me
faith
you're
hurting
people
you're
hurting
yourself
but
that's
not
it
that's
not
what
bothers
you
so
much
what
bugs
you
is
you
know
i'm
right
you
know
in
your
gut
we
don't
need
the
law
we
are
the
law
no
yes
you
know
exactly
what
i'm
about
'cause
you
have
it
in
you
too
no
faith
you're
sick
i've
seen
it
b
you've
got
the
lust
and
i'm
not
just
talking
about
screwing
vampires
don't
you
dare
bring
him
into
this
it
was
good
wasn't
it
the
sex
the
danger
bet
a
part
of
you
even
dug
him
when
he
went
psycho
no
see
you
need
me
to
toe
the
line
because
you're
afraid
you'll
go
over
it
aren't
you
b
you
can't
handle
watching
me
living
my
own
way
having
a
blast
because
it
tempts
you
you
know
it
could
be
you
there's
my
girl
no
i'm
not
gonna
do
this
why
not
it
feels
good
blood
rising
oh
god
i
hear
once
you've
tasted
a
slayer
you
never
wanna
go
back
oh
no
no
this
is
no
good
at
all
so
she
saved
you
she
could
have
left
me
there
to
die
giles
but
she
didn't
she
opted
to
come
back
to
town
with
you
that
that
bodes
well
she
still
has
a
lot
to
face
before
she
can
put
this
behind
her
i'm
not
gonna
give
up
on
her
then
i
think
she
stands
a
chance
you
sent
your
boy
to
kill
me
that's
right
i
did
he's
dust
i
thought
he
might
be
what
with
you
standing
here
and
all
i
guess
that
means
you
have
a
job
opening
