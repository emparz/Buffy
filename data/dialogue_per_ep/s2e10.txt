the
damn
slayer
nonsense
dere
is
but
one
and
i
am
she
okay
a
scenario
you

off
i'll
back
off
but
you
promise
not
to
go
all
wiggy
until
we
can
go
to
my
watcher
and
figure
this
out
wiggy
you
know
no
kicko
no
fighto
i
accept
your
scenario
so
you
were
sent
here
yes
by
my
watcher
to
do
what
exactly
to
do
my
duty
i
am
here
to
kill
vampires
and
your
watcher
is
iis
sam
zabuto
you
say
yes
sir
we've
never
met
but
he
he's
he's
very
wellrespected
what
so
he's
a
real
guy
as
in
nonfictional
and
you
are
called
i
am
de
vampire
slayer
we
got
that
part
hon
he
means
your
name
oh
dey
call
me
kendra
i
have
no
last
name
sir
can
you
say
'stuck
in
the
80's'
buffy
please
uh
there's
obviously
some
some
misunderstanding
here
hey
identify
yourself
back
off
pink
ranger
this
is
my
friend
friend
yeah
as
in
person
you
hang
with
amigo
i
don't
understand
you
try
i'm
tapped
uhuh
kendra
uh
there
are
aaa
few
people
uh
cicivilians
if
you
like
who
who
know
buffy's
identity
willow
is
one
of
them
aa
and
they
also
um
spend
time
together
uh
socially
and
you
allow
dis
sir
well
uh
but
de
slayer
must
work
in
secret
for
security
of
course
uh
but
uh
with
buffy
however
itit's
um
some
flexibility
is
required
why
hi
guys
wwhat's
goin'
on
apparently
there's
been
a
really
big
mixup
uh
it
seems
somehow
that
uh
another
slayer
has
been
sent
to
sunnydale
is
that
even
possible
i
mean
two
slayers
at
the
same
time
not
to
my
knowledge
um
ththe
new
slayer
is
only
called
after
the
previous
slayer
has
died
uh
oh
good
lord
you
were
dead
buffy
i
was
only
gone
for
a
minute
clearly
it
doesn't
matter
how
long
you
were
gone
you
were
physically
dead
thus
causing
the
activation
of
the
the
next
slayer
she
died
just
a
little
she
drowned
but
she
was
revived
so
there
really
are
two
of
them
it
would
seem
so
this
is
completely
unprecedented
i'm
quite
flummoxed
what's
the
flum
it's
a
mistake
she
isn't
supposed
to
be
here
she
goes
home
look
no
offense
i
really
don't
mean
this
personally
but
i'm
not
dead
and
frankly
having
you
around
creeps
me
out
just
a
little
bit
i
cannot
just
leave
i
was
sent
here
for
a
reason
mr
zabuto
said
all
de
signs
indicate
dat
a
very
dark
power
is
about
to
rise
in
sunnydale
and
what's
your
great
plan
for
finding
this
dark
power
you
just
gonna
attack
people
randomly
till
you
find
a
bad
one
of
course
not
then
why
the
hell
did
you
attack
me
i
tought
you
were
a
vampire
oh
a
swing
and
a
miss
for
the
rookie
i
had
good
reason
to
tink
you
were
did
i
not
see
you
kissing
a
vampire
buffy
would
never
do
that
oh
except
for
that
sometimes
you
do
that
but
only
with
angel

saw
me

dirty
i
can
feel

if

where's
angel
my
buddy
angel
you

i'd
let

i
saved
him
in
the
nick
he
was
about
five
minutes
away
from
being
a
crispy
critter
where'd
he
go
uh
he
said
he
was
gonna
stay
underground
you

recuperate
are
you
telling
me
the
truth
i
swear
on
my
mother's
grave
should
something
fatal
happen
to
her
god
forbid
den
he
is
alright
we
can
return
to
your
watcher
for
our
orders
i
don't
take
orders
i
do
things
my
way
no
wonder
you
died
let's
go
i
i
have
to
ask
has
either
of
you
girls
considered
modeling
i
have
a
friend
with
a
camera
strictly
highclass
nude
work
you
know
art
photographs
but
naked
you
don't
have
to
answer
right
away
i
was
dreaming
of
what
pet
we
were
in
paris
you
had
a
branding
iron
i
brought
you
something
and
there
were
worms
in
my
baguette
your
sire
my
sweet
my
angel
the
one
and
only
now
all
we
need's
the
full
moon
tonight
and
he
will
die
and
you
will
be
fully
restored
my
black
goddess
my
ripe
wicked
plum
it's
been
forever
spike
let
me
have
him
hmm
until
the
moon
alright
you
can
play
but
don't
kill
him
he
mustn't
die
till
the
ritual
bring
him
to
me
you've
been
a
very
bad
daddy
kendra
ii've
uh
conferred
with
your
watcher
mr
zabuto
and
uh
we
both
agree
that
uh
until
this
matter
with
spike
and
drusilla
has
been
resolved
that
you
two
should
work
together
oh
that'll
be
a
treat
so
you
believe
dat
spike
is
attempting
to
revive
dis
drusilla
to
health
yes
well
iiii
think
that's
the
uh
the
dark
power
that
your
your
watcher
rereferred
to
you
see
uh
you
see
drusilla's
not
only
evil
she's
uh
well
she's
also
quite
mad
andandandand
if
she's
restored
to
her
full
health
then
uh
well
there's
no
absolutely
no
telling
what
she
might
do
den
we
will
stop
spike
ooo
good
plan
let's
go
charge
buffy
it's
a
little
more
complicated
than
that
john
wayne
yes
i'm
i'm
afraid
it
is
you
see
spike
has
also
called
out
the
order
of
taraka
to
keep
buffy
out
of
the
way
de
assassins
i
read
of
dem
in
de
writings
of
dramius
oh
really
wwwhich
volume
i
believe
it
was
six
sir
um
how
do
you
know
all
this
from
me
studies
so
obviously
you
have
a
lot
of
free
time
i
study
because
it
is
required
the
slayer
handbook
insists
on
it
there's
a
slayer
handbook
wait
handbook
what
handbook
how
come
i
don't
have
a
handbook
is
there
a
tshirt
too
'cause
that
would
be
cool
after
meeting
you
buffy
i
realized
that
uh
the
handbook
would
be
of
no
use
in
your
case
well
what
do
you
mean
it
would
be
of
no
use
in
my
case
wha
what's
wrong
with
my
case
uh
kendra
um
perhaps
you'd
like
to
show
me
the
the
part
in
uh
dramius
six
where
uh
uh
where
it
refers
to
the
order
of
taraka
really
ii
i
seem
to
have
never
been
able
to
get
through
that
book
it
was
a
bit
stodgy
it
was
difficult
all
dose
footnotes
hello
and
welcome
to
planet
pocket
protector
oh
well
bbuffy
principal
snyder
was
snooping
round
after
you
eee
career
fair
best
make
an
appearance
i
think
right
buffy's
a
student
here
yes
riiight
of
course
and
i
imagine
she's
a
cheerleader
as
well
oh
no
well
aaactually
she
had
to
give
up
her
cheerleading
uh
it
was
quite
an
amusing
story
actually
get
a
load
of
the
shegiles
creepy
ew
i'll
bet
giles
wishes
i
was
more
of
a
book
geek
giles
is
enough
of
a
book
geek
for
the
both
of
you
yeah
but
did
you
see
how
they
were
vibing
volume
six
ha
ha
ha
buffy
no
one
could
replace
you
you'll
always
be
giles'
favorite
i
wonder
of
course
you
will
you're
his
slayer
the
real
slayer
no
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
so
bad
being
replaced
you
mean
like
letting
kendra
take
over
maybe
i
mean
maybe
after
this
thing
with
spike
and
the
assassins
is
over
i
could
say
'kendra
you
slay
i'm
going
to
disneyland'
willow
but
not
forever
right
no
disneyland
would
get
boring
after
a
few
months
but
i
could
do
other
stuff
career
day
stuff
maybe
i
could
even
have
a
normal
life
could
you
sit
down
or
change
your
pattern
or
something
you're
making
me
queasy
because
you're
just
sitting
there
you
should
be
thinking
up
a
plan
i
have
a
plan
we
wait
buffy
saves
us
how
will
she
even
know
where
to
find
us
cordelia
this
is
buffy's
house
odds
are
she'll
find
us
well
what
if
she
doesn't
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
just
waste
away
down
here
with
you
haw
haw
no
thank
you
what
are
you
doin'
going
to
see
if
he's
gone
that's
brilliant
what
if
he
isn't
oh
right
you
think
we
should
just
slack
here
and
hope
that
somebody
else
decides
to
be
a
hero
sorry
forgot
i
was
stranded
with
a
loser
and
yet
i
never
forgot
that
i'm
stuck
with
the
numbbrain
that
let
mr
mutant
in
the
house
in
the
first
place
he
looked
normal
what
is
he
supposed
to
have
an
arrow
with
the
word
'assassin'
over
his
head
all
it
took
was
the
prospect
of
a
free
makeover
and
you
licked
his
hand
like
a
big
dumb
dog
you
know
what
i'm
going
i'd
rather
be
worm
food
than
look
at
your
pathetic
face
then
go
i'm
not
stopping
ya
i
bet
you
wouldn't
i
bet
you'd
let
a
girl
go
off
to
her
doom
all
by
herself
not
just
any
girl
you're
special
i
can't
believe
that
i'm
stuck
spending
what
will
probably
be
my
last
few
moments
on
earth
here
with
you
i
hope
these
are
my
last
few
moments
three
more
seconds
with
you

i'm
gonna
i'm
gonna
what
coward

a
a
rather
violent
visit
from

met
the
king
freak
of
the
hello

iit's
rather
complicated
but
she's
also
a
slayer
hi
nice
to
meet
you
a
slayer
huh
i
knew
this
'i'm
the
only
one
i'm
the
only
one'
thing
was
just
an
attentiongetter
just
say
hello
xander
welcome
so
you're
a
slayer
huh
i
like
that
in
a
woman
uh
i
hope
i
tank
you
i
mean
sir
um
i
will
be
of
service
great
good
it's
good
to
be
a
giver
xander
um
this
this
uh
assassin
you
encountered
what
uh
what
did
he
look
like
uhh
uhh
ohmigod
i'm
showering
like
that
you
and
bug
people
xander
what's
up
with
that
no
but
this
dude
was
completely
different
than
praying
mantis
lady
he
was
a
man
of
bugs
not
a
man
who
was
a
bug
the
uh
thethethe
important
thing
is
everybody's
alright
still
it's
quite
apparent
that
we're
under
serious
attack
these
taraka
are
definitely
serious
fortunately
for
me
so
is
kendra
and
uh
i
fear
the
worst
is
still
to
come
i've
ii've
discovered
the
remaining
keys
to
drusilla's
cure
the
uh
the
ritual
requires
that
the
presence
of
her
sire
and
it
must
take
place
in
a
church
on
the
night
of
the
new
moon
the
new
moon
but
that
is
tonight
exactly
and
ii'm
sure
the
assassins
were
here
to
kill
buffy
before
she
could
put
a
stop
to
things
they
need
drusilla's
sire
you
mean
the
vamp
that
made
her
yes
buffy
what
is
it
angel
he's
drusilla's
sire
man
that
guy
got
major
neck
in
his
day
will
this
ritual
kill
him
yes
i'm
afraid
it
will
we
need
to
find
this
church
we
need
to
find
where
this
ritual
is
gonna
take
place
agreed
and
we
must
work
quickly
we
have
five
hours
before
sundown
don't
worry
buffy
we'll
save
angel
angel
but

honey
until
you
came
and
ripped
their
throats
out
there

fortythree
churches

seems
a
little
excessive
it's
the
extra
evil
vibe
from
the
hellmouth
makes
people
pray
harder
well
check
and
see
if
any
of
them
are
closed
or

different
perhaps
when
dis
is
over
you
can
uh
show
me
how
to
work
it
when
this
is
over
i'm
thinking
pineapple
pizza
and
teen
video
movie
fest
possibly
something
from
the
ringwald
oeuvre
oh
here
we
go
i
am
the
bug
man
coo
coo
ka
choo
okay
okay
he
can
only
be
killed
when
he's
in
his
disassembled
state
disassembled
that
means
when
he's
broken
down
into
his
liiittle
buggy
parts
i
know
what
it
means
dorkhead
dorkhead
you
slash
me
with
your
words
your
life
is
very
different
dan
mine
you
mean
the
part
where
i
occasionally
have
one
yeah
i
guess
it
is
de
tings
you
do
and
have
i
was
taught
distract
from
my
calling
friends
school
even
family
even
family
my
parents
dey
sent
me
to
my
watcher
when
i
was
very
young
how
young
i
don't
remember
dem
actually
i've
seen
pictures
but
uh
dat's
how
seriously
de
calling
is
taken
by
my
people
my
modder
and
fadder
gave
me
to
my
watcher
because
dey
believed
dat
dey
were
doing
de
right
ting
for
me
and
for
de
world
please
i
don't
feel
sorry
for
meself
why
should
you
i
don't
know
i
i
guess
it
just
sounds
very
lonely
emotions
are
weakness
buffy
you
shouldn't
entertain
dem
kendra
my
emotions
give
me
power
they're
total
assets
maybe
for
you
but
i
prefer
to
keep
an
even
mind
mm
i
guess
that
explains
it
explains
what
oh
well
when
we
were
fighting
uh
you're
amazing
your
technique
it's
flawless
it's
hmm
better
than
mine
i
know
still
i
woulda
kicked
your
butt
in
the
end
and
ya
know
why
no
imagination
really
ya
tink
so
oh
i
know
so
you're
good
but
power
alone
isn't
enough
a
good
fighter
needs
to
know
how
to
improvise
to
go
with
the
flow
uhuh
seriously
don't
get
me
wrong
yyou
really
do
have
potential
potential
i
could
wipe
de
floor
wit
you
right
now
that
would
be
anger
you're
feeling
what
you
feel
it
right
how
the
anger
gives
you
fire
a
slayer
needs
that
excuse
me
ladies
nice
knife
i'm
guessing
dating
isn't
big
with
your
watcher
either
i'm
not
permitted
to
speak
with
boys
unless
you're
pummeling
them
wait
a
minute
what
that
guy
the
sleazoid
you
nearly
decked
in
the
bar
you
tink
he
might
help
us
i
tink
we
might
make
him
say
'uncle'
oh
that's
right
you
killed
my
uncle
that's
it
then
off
to
church
it
makes
pretty
colors
pft
i'll
see
him
die
soon
enough
i've
never
been
much
for
the
preshow

what
drusilla
