the
most
troublesome

a
match
between
you

on
the
one
hand
buffy
hasn't
stabbed
a
horticulture
teacher
with
a
trowel
i
didn't
stab
anyone

a
trowel
they
were
pruning

on
the
other
hand

iit
coulda
been
mice
mice
mmice

of
you
seem
to
be
tied
in
the
classcutting
and
fight
starting
events
you
really
are
neck
and
neck
here
it's
quite
exciting
what
does
the
winner
get
expelled
thursday
is
parent
teacher
night
your
parents
assuming
you
have
any
will
meet
your
teachers
assuming
you
have
any
left
i've
decided
to
put
the
two
of
you
in
charge
of
this
event
you
have
three
days
to
prepare
the
refreshments
make
the
banners
and
transform
the
school
lounge
into
a
habitable
place
for
adults
this
will
incur
my
good
will
and
may
affect
what
i
tell
your
parents
when
i
meet
them
are
we
clear
i'm
clear
don't
you
feel
clear
we're
very
clear
good
because
you
mess
up
this
time
and
your
parents
will
be
coming
to
clean
out
your
lockers
well
it
shouldn't
be
that
hard
we
can
work
on
the
banners
at
lunch
tomorrow
and
figure
out
refreshments
then
yeah
sure
whatever
hey
meat
pie
snyder's
got
you
guys
making
party
favors
huh
his
two
worst
students
that's
what
mom
sees
when
she
looks
at
me
a
sheila
well
sheila's
definitely
intense
that
guy
with
her
that's
the
guy
she
can
bring
home
to
mother
she
was
already
smoking
in
fifth
grade
once
i
was
lookout
for
her
you're
bad
to
the
bone
i'm
a
rebel
it's
not
fair
i'm
the
slayer
that
requires
a
certain
amount
of
cutting
and
fighting
what's
sheila's
excuse
homework
she
won't
do
it
and
most
teachers
respect
that
now
oh
you
might
wanna
keep
away
any
sharp
implements
when
you're
working
with
her
do
you
think
any
other
slayers
ever
had
to
go
to
high
school
it's
no
biggie
you'll
have
a
nice
soiree
the
parents
will
love
it
as
long
as
nothing
really
bad
happens
between
now
and
then
you'll
be
fine
are
you
crazy
what
did
you
say
that
for
now
something
bad
is
gonna
happen
whadaya
mean
nothing's
gonna
happen
not
until
some
dummy
says
'as
long
as
nothing
bad
happens'
buffy
it's
the
ultimate
jinx
what
were
you
thinking
or
were
you
even
thinking
at
all
well
you
guys
don't
know
maybe
this
time
it'll
be
different
home
sweet
home
the
master
is
dead
someone
has
to
take
his
place
as
long
as
the
slayer's
alive
whoever
takes
his
place
will
be
sharing
his
grave
then
let
the
soul
who
kills
her
wear
his
mantle
can
you
do
it
yes
this
weekend
the
night
of
st
vigeous
our
power

the
greatest
event

uh
this
absorption
rate
how
is
it
reflected
in
your
homework

now
cordelia
i
have
at
least
three
lives
to
contend
