gave
me
a
pretty
good
run
there
bet
the
blood's
just
pumpin'
bet
it's
hot
don't
hurt
me
don't
hurt
you
hey
what's
going
on
help
me
call
the
police
get
outta
here
girl
you
guys
havin'
a
fight
'cause
you
know
fighting's
not
cool
get
out
of
here
no
no
she
wants
to
stay
i
don't
mind
a
little
appetizer
have
you
ever
heard
the
expression
'biting
off
more
than
you
can
chew'
okay
um
how
about
the
expression
'vampire
slayer'
what
the
hell
you
talkin'
about
wow
never
heard
that
one
okay
how
about
'oh
god
my
leg
my
leg'
oh
god
my
leg
uhh
see
now
we're
communicating
wow
been
a
long
while
since
i
met
one
who
didn't
know
me
you
should
get
home
hhow'd
you
do
that
it's
what
i
do
but
you're
you're
just
a
girl
that's
what
i
keep
saying
something
goin'
on
out
back
vampire
oh
anything
nothing
you
want
to
hear
the
ritual
is
uh
explain
it
again
there's
nothing
new
to
go
through
it
again
the
key
was
living
energy
it
needed
to
be
channeled
poured
into
a
specific
place
at
a
specific
time
the
energy
would
flow
into
that
spot
the
walls
between
the
dimensions
break
down
it
stops
the
energy's
used
up
the
walls
come
back
up
glory
uses
that
time
to
get
back
into
her
own
dimension
not
caring
that
all
manner
of
hell
will
be
unleashed
on
earth
in
the
meantime
um
but
only
for
a
little
while
right
the
walls
come
back
up
uh
nno
more
hell
that's
only
if
the
energy
is
stopped
and
now
the
key
is
human

is
dawn
the
blood
flows
the
gates
will
open
the
gates
will
close
when
it
flows
no
more
when
dawn
is
dead
i
have
places
to
be
why
blood
why
dawn's
blood
i
mean
why
couldn't
it
be
like
a
a
lymph
ritual
'cause
it's
always
got
to
be
blood
we're
not
actually
discussing
dinner
right
now
blood
is
life
lackbrain
why
do
you
think
we
eat
it
it's
what
keeps
you
going
makes
you
warm
makes
you
hard
makes
you
other
than
dead
course
it's
her
blood
pretty
simple
math
here
we
stop
glory
before
she
can
start
the
ritual
we
still
have
a
couple
of
hours
right
if
my
calculations
are
right
but
buffy
i
don't
wanna
hear
it
i
understand
that
no
no
you
don't
understand
we
are
not
talking
about
this
yes
we
bloody
well
are
if
glory
begins
the
ritual
if
we
can't
stop
her
come
on
say
it
we're
bloody
well
talking
about
this
tell
me
to
kill
my
sister
she's
not
your
sister
no
she's
not
she's
more
than
that
she's
me
the
monks
made
her
out
of
me
i
hold
her
and
i
feel
closer
to
her
than

it's
not
just
the
memories
they
built
it's
physical
dawn
is
a
part
of
me
the
only
part
that
i
we'll
solve
this
we
will
don't
have
another
coma
okay
if
the
ritual
starts
then
every
living
creature
in
this
and
every
other
dimension
imaginable
will
suffer
unbearable
torment
and
death

including
dawn
then
the
last
thing
she'll
see
is
me
protecting
her
you'll
fail
you'll
die
we
all
will
i'm
sorry
i
love
you
all
but
i'm
sorry
okay
all
in
favor
of
stopping
glory
before
the
ritual
suggestions
ideas
time's
awastin'
uh
when
you
say
you
love
us
all
shut
up
willow
i
bet
you've
got
some
dark
spell
abrewin'
uh
make
her
a
a
a
toad
little
hoppy
toad
we
can
hit
her
with
a
hammer
hoppy
toad
what
about
ben
he
can
be
killed
right
i
mean
i
know
he's
an
innocent
but
you
know
not
like
dawn
innocent
we
could
kill
a
regular
guy
god
it's
doubtful
he'll
surface
again
this
close
to
the
ritual
we
can
expect
it's
glory
we're
dealing
with
we
don't
have
to
kill
her
uh
we
just
have
to
stop
her
from
doing
the
ritual
i
mean
there's
only
the
one
time
that
she
can
do
it
right
yeah
we
get
her
on
the
ropes
we
just
gotta
keep
her
occupied
till
it's
too
late
okay
but
i'm
still
not
hearing
enough
ideas
she's
a
god
let's
think
outside
the
box
why
don't
you
go
think
outside
the
bleeding
box
yes
anya
apart
from
your
incredibly
uninfectious
enthusiasm
have
you
anything
else
to
contribu
the
dagon
sphere
sorry
when
buffy
first
met
glory
she
found
that
magical

glowy
sphere
that
was
meant
to
repel
glory
we've
got
it
in
the
basement
it
might
drive
her
away
or
hurt
her
ooh
and
olaf
the
troll
god's
enchanted
hammer
you
wanna
fight
a
god
use
the
weapon
of
a
god
uh
nah
that
thing's
too
heavy
to
yeah
good
i
like
this
thanks
here
to
help
wanna
live
smart
chicks
are
soooo
hot
you
couldn't
have
figured
that
out
in
tenth
grade
well
we
have
some
ideas
if
we
could
actually
get
glory
on
the
run
but
um
but
we
still
have
no
idea
how
to
find
her
big
day
oh
it
calls
me
i
have
to
be
there
big
day
they
uh
said
you
have
to
put
this
on
for
the
ceremony
what
if
i
don't
come
on
just
what
if
i
don't
like
the
color
look
i
i
wish
there
was
another
way
and
i
wish
you'd
fall
on
your
head
and
drown
in
your
own
barf
so

i
guess
we're
both
disappointed
i
think
it'll
be
quick
actually
sir
the
bleeding
is
quite
a
slow
process
to
give
the
portal
time
to
thank
you
for
the
information
i'll
do
what
i
can
to
change
what
change
be
her
i
don't
wanna
look
at
you
dawn
i
don't
think
you
wanna
be
glory
be
glory
glory
glory
glory
will
you
just
stop
shouting
already
huh
so
what's
the
hubbub
bub
what
do
you
got
against
old
benjy
he's
a
monster
at
least
you're
upfront
about
it
don't
be
so
hard
on
the
boy
he
just
wants
to
live
most
guys
would
do
the
same
besides
he's
probably
the
reason
your
sis
and
her
little
cartoon
pals
are
still
alive
that
little
nagging
pinch
of
humanity
that
makes
me
go
for
the
hurt
instead
of
the
kill
lowering
myself
to
trade
blows
with
the
slayer
when
i
should
have
just
put
my
fist
through
her
heart
it's
gotta
be
ben
or
maybe
you
just
can't
take
her
hmm
funny
thing
you've
been
here
for
a
few
hours
now
and
i
haven't
seen
big
sis
galloping
in
to
save
you
she
probably
knows
what
a
terrible
mistake
that'd
be
she's
not
afraid
of
you
oh
no
sweetie
baby
i'm
talking
about
the
ritual
'cause
you
know
i
bleed
you
the
portals
open
but
once
you
die
they
close
the
faster
you
die
the
better
for
your
sorry
species
i'm
bettin'
buffy
knows
that
since
she's
not
really
your
sister
i'm
guessin'
she
isn't
gonna
show
and
if
she
does
it
might
not
be
to
save
you
buffy
you
sure
you're
not
going
to
tire
yourself
out
i'm
sure
we're
still
working
on
ideas
time's
short
but
uh
best
leave
it
to
the
last
moment
if
we
go
in
too
early
and
she
takes
us
out
no
chance
of
getting
her
to
miss
her
window
then
we
wait
i
imagine
you
hate
me
right
now
i
love
dawn
i
know
but
i've
sworn
to
protect
this
sorry
world
and
sometimes
that
means
saying
and
doing
what
other
people
can't
what
they
shouldn't
have
to
you
try
and
hurt
her
and
you
know
i'll
stop
you
i
know
this
is
how
many
apocalypses
for
us
now
oh
uh
well
six
at
least
feels
like
a
hundred
i've
always
stopped
them
always
won
yes
i
sacrificed
angel
to
save
the
world
i
loved
him
so
much
but
i
knew
what
was
right
i
don't
have
that
any
more
i
don't
understand
i
don't
know
how
to
live
in
this
world
if
these
are
the
choices
if
everything
just
gets
stripped
away
i
don't
see
the
point
i
just
wish
that
i
just
wish
my
mom
was
here
the
spirit
guide
told
me
that
death
is
my
gift
guess
that
means
a
slayer
really
is
just
a
killer
after
all
i
think
you're
wrong
about
that
it
doesn't
matter
if
dawn
dies
i'm
done
with
it
i'm
quitting
okay
campers
it's
almost
stab
time
you
two
get
her
no
no
aah
buffy
see
you
in
a
few
any
luck
have
you
found
the
dagon
sphere
um
i'm
sure
it's
here
just
be
a
minute
yeah
we're
on
it
let's
look
over
here
where
we
didn't
look
yet
time
is
a
factor
yes
yes
not
to
worry
so
are
you
more
uh
relaxed
no
no
i
mean
it
sounded
like
you
uh

arrived
no
yes
um
i
had
the
pleasure
moment
and
the
blissful
calm
that
comes
right
after
it
but
that
only
lasted
a
couple
of
seconds
and
now
i'm
terrified
again
well
you
don't
have
to
be
gah
what
spike's
sexbot
why
didn't
they
just
melt
it
down
into
scrap
maybe
willow
wanted
it
i
don't
think
willow
feels
that
way
about
about
buffy
i
mean
i
know
she's
gone
through
a
lot
of
changes
but
to
study
it
right
robotics
science
pervert
other
pervert
and
don't
frighten
me
like
thaaah
god
who
who
would
put
something
like
that
there
is
this
supposed
to
be
some
sort
of
sick
joke
i
mean
things
aren't
bad
enough
this
is
an
omen
hey
hey
shh
no
no
it's
an
omen
it's
a
higher
power
trying
to
tell
me
through
bunnies
that
we're
all
gonna
die
oh
god
no
it's
not
it's
okay
no
you
see
usually
when
there's
an
apocalypse
i
skedaddle
but
now
i
love
you
so
much
that
instead
i
have
inappropriately
timed
sex
and
try
to
think
of
ways
to
fight
a
god
and
worry
terribly
that
something
might
happen
to
you
and
also
worry
that
something'll
happen
to
me
and
then
i
have
guilt
that
i'm
not
more
worried
about
everyone
else
but
i
just
don't
have
enough
i'm
just
on
total
overload
and
i
honestly
don't
think
that
i
could
be
more
nervous
than
i
am
right
now
care
to
wager
on
that
anya
you
wanna
marry
me
can
i
take
that
as
a
maybe
you're
proposing
to
me
yes
you're
proposing
to
me
'cause
we're
gonna
die
and
you
think
it's
romantic
and
sexy
and
and
you
know
you're
not
gonna
have
to
go
through
with
it
'cause
the
world's
gonna
end
i'm
proposing
to
you
anya
because
it's
not
you
can't
know
that
i
believe
it
i
think
we're
gonna
get
through
this
i
think
i'm
gonna
live
a
long
and
silly
life
and
i'm
not
interested
in
doing
that
without
you
around
oh
okay
okay
yes
i
mean
yes
no
no
after
give
it
to
me
when
the
world
doesn't
end
will
what
do
you
got
for
me
some
ideas
well
notions
or
theories
based
on
wild
speculation
did
i
mention
i'm
not
good
under
pressure
i
need
you
will
you're
my
big
gun
i'm
your
no
ii
was
never
a
gun
someone
else
should
be
the
gun
i
i
could
be
a
a
cudgel
or
or
a
pointy
stick
you're
the
strongest
person
here
you
know
that
right
well
no
will
you're
the
only
person
that's
ever
hurt
glory
at
all
you're
my
best
shot
at
getting
her
on
the
ropes
so
don't
get
a
jelly
belly
on
me
now
well
i
i
do
sort
of
have
this
one
idea
but
last
few
days
i've
mostly
been
looking
into
ways
to
help
tara
ii
know
that
shouldn't
be
my
priority
of
course
it
should
well
i've
been
charting
their
essences
mapping
out
i
think
if
i
can
get
close
enough
i
may
be
able
to
reverse
what
glory
did
like
take
back
what
she
took
from
tara
it
might
weaken
glory
or
make
her
less
coherent
or
it
might
make
all
our
heads
explode
buffy
i'll
try
to
work
it
don't
worry
love
it
won't
be
long
bitch
i'm
supposed
to
work
on
the
factors
i'm
i'm
not
i'm
not
i'm
gonna
bring
you
back

no
no
that's
good
that
could
be
pivotal

the
end
of
the
world
even
if
that
happens
to
be
tonight
i'll
be
a
minute
yeah
i
know

never
love

i
know

and
i'll
kill
anyone
who
comes
near
dawn
well
not
exactly
the
st
crispin's
day
speech
was
it
we
few
we
happy
few
we
band
of
buggered
shpadoinkle
what
is
that
the
portal
must
open
up
there
will
you're
up
need
anything
could
use
a
little
courage
the
real
kind
but
thanks
you
what
are
you
doing
here
she's
with
me
what
the
frickin'
hell
did
that
bitch
do
to
me
you
look
fine
truly
she
made
a
little
she
made
a
hole
uh
i
need
a
brain
to
eat
oh
take
mine
oh
groovetastic
one
i
said
a
brain
you
worthless
dirt
big
day
i
got
places
to
be
big
day
need
a
brain
suppose
i
could
always
use
yours
okay
then
come
and
get
it
you
don't
seem
very
well
your
little
witch
bitch
gave
me
kind
of
a
headache
there
but
if
you
think
this
is
gonna
last
more
than
eight
seconds
i
noticed
you're
talking
whereas
in
your
position
i
would
attack
me
oh
most
sweatynaughtyfeelingscausing
one
should
we
go
guard
the
girl
this
is
a
this
is
a
a
diversionary
tactic
go
guard
it's
strange
you're
not
as
blurry
with
speed
as
usual
either
the
witch
it's
not
her
might
be
this
i
heard
it's
supposed
to
repel
you
so
my
guess
is
you
probably
shouldn't
touch
it
either
you're
gonna
wish
you
stand
fast
kill
anyone
who
dares
approach
this
will
be
our
day
of
glory
well
punned
well
it
just
called
out
to
me
tara
