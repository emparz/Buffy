the
way
you
love
have
you
got
a
name
for
it
cause
i
don't
understand
it
the
camera
pans
past
the
singer
and
into
the
crowd
cordelia
and
xander
are
dancing
close
with
their
arms
around
each
other
and
smiling
the
language
is
an
annoying
necessity
and
i
depend
on
all
the
regular
things
the
camera
reaches
willow
who
is
looking
around
for
buffy
she
turns
around
looks
up
and
spots
her
on
the
upper
level
leaning
against
the
railing
and
watching
the
band
the
camera
pans
up
to
her
got
a
list
tattooed
on
my
memory
of
how
our
tryst
should
unfold
behind
buffy
a
boy
approaches
her
i'm
falling
from
the
opposite
ben
hey
what
good
is
it
ben
i'm
ben
we
had
algebra
ii
together
last
year
fight
the
map
with
no

pretty
much
repress
anything
mathrelated
my
heart's
enlarged
and
i
charge
what

ben
ms
jackson
second
period
you

in
the
seat
three
over
and
one
behind
to
a
dream
that

away
buffy
oh

the
one
with

at
the

falling
from
the
opposite
what
good
is
it

a
missing
gun
and
two
confused
kids
on
my
hands
pieces
of
the
puzzle
and
i'm
gonna
look
at
all
the
pieces
carefully
and
rationally
and
i'm
gonna
keep
looking
until
i
know
exactly
how
this
is
all
your
fault
mr
snyder
billy
crandal
chained
himself
to
the
snack
machine
again
pathetic
little
nolife
vegan
not
so
fast
missy
i'm
not
done
with
you
yet
you
stink
of
lies
so
for
next
time
read
the
chapters
on
information
grouping
and
binary
coding
i
bet
you'll
think
coding
is
pretty
cool
i
mean
if
you
find
twodigit
multistacked
conversions
and
primary
number
clusters
a
big
hoot
giles
i
made
them
laugh
did
you
hear
i
did
the
joke
thing
yes
yes
so
it
seems
ii
mean
um
uh
you
did
indeed
good
good
good
show
iii
just
stopped
by
to
to
see
if
you
needed
any
assistance
but
you
seem
to
have
things
quite
under
control
well
i
had
good
lesson
plans
ms
calendar
had
them
on
her
computer
yes
yes
she
was
very
um
uh
dedicated
and
i
found
a
bunch
of
files
and
internet
sites
on
paganism
and
magic
and
stuff
oh
yes
it's
really
interesting
and
uh
i
found
this
in
her
drawer
she
told
me
it
was
a
rose
quartz
and
it
has
healing
powers
i
thought
she'd
want
you
to
have
it
oh
thank
you
willow
that's
um
that's
very
thoughtful
of
you
before
1935
the
new
deal
focused
on
revitalizing
stricken
business
and
agricultural
communities
and
the
new
deal
also
tried
to
regulate
the
nation's
financial
hierarchy
to
avoid
another
disaster
like
the
1929
stock
market
crash
don't
forget
your
assignments
are
due
on
friday
class
i
told
ms
hall
we'd
go
help
decorate
the
gym
who
are
you
taking
david
said
yes
oh
you're
kidding
he's
so
dreamy
thank
you
thank
you
james
how
are
you
enjoying
that
book
i
loaned
you
the
hemingway
i
like
it
very
much
it's
honest
yes
it's
um
it's
based
on
a
true
story
actually
he
fell
in
love
with
his
hours
child
labor
and
collective
bargaining
oh
my
god
did
you
see
what
he
wrote
i'm
telling
you
something
weird
is
going
on
something
weird
is
going
on
isn't
that
our
school
motto
pretty
much
but
i
don't
know
this
time
it
bugs
me
i
don't
wanna
poopoo
your
wiggins
but
a
domestic
dispute
a
little
case
of
chalkboard
tourette's
all
sounds
like
hellmouth
lite
to
me
xander
what
happened
did
cordelia
win
another
round
in
the
broom
closet
you're
just
a
big
bucket
of
funny
will
i'll
have
you
know
i
was
just
accosted
by
some
kind
of
um
locker
monster
loch
ness
monster
'locker'
monster
is
what
he
said
but
it
wasn't
really
a
monster
it
was
like
this
big
arm
that
came
out
of
the
locker
but
then
we
opened
it
again
it
was
gone
nothing
this
was
right
after
buffy's
history
teacher
starts
doing
some
freaky
channeling
thing
in
class
ooh
sounds
like
paranormal
phenomena
a
ghost
cool
oh
no
no
no
no
cool
this
was
no
wimpy
chain
rattler
this
was
'i'm
dead
as
hell
and
i'm
not
gonna
take
it
anymore'
giles
well
despite
the
xanderspeak
that's
a
fairly
accurate
definition
of
a
poltergeist
i
defined
something
accurately
so
we
have
some
bad
boo
on
our
hands
yes
well
why
is
it
here
does
it
just
wanna
scare
people
unfortunately
he
doesn't
know
exactly
what
he
wants
that's
that's
the
trouble
see
uh
many
times
the
spirit
is
plagued
by
all
manner
of
worldly
troubles
being
dead
it
has
no
way
to
uh
to
make
its
peace
so
it
it
lashes
out
growing
ever
more
confused
ever
more
angry
so
it's
a
normal
teenager
only
dead
well
what
can
we
do
is
there
any
way
to
stop
it
uh
the
only
tried
and
true
way
is
to
work
out
what
unresolved
issues
keep
it
here
andandand
um
resolve
them
fabulous
now
we're
dr
laura
for
the
deceased
only
if
we
can
find
out
who
this
spirit
is
or
was
working
late
ms
frank
my
fault
let
myself
get
behind
is
it
okay
to
walk
here
george
it
is
george
right
oh
yes
ma'am
you
go
ahead
thanks
you
have
a
nice
evening
you
too
drive
safe
oh
ms
frank
yes
you
can't
make
me
disappear
just
because
you
say
it's
over
there's
no
way
we
can
be
together
no
way
people
will
ever
understand
accept
it
is
that
what
this
is
about
what
other
people
think
no
i
just
want
you
to
be
able
to
have
some
kind
of
a
normal
life
we
can
never
have
that
don't
you
see
i
don't
give
a
damn
about
a
normal
life
i'm
going
crazy
not
seeing
you
i
think
about
you
every
minute
i
know
but
it's
over
it
has
to
be
come
back
here
we're
not
finished
yet
you
don't
care
anymore
is
that
it
it
doesn't
matter
it
doesn't
matter
what
i
feel
then
tell
me
you
don't
love
me
say
it
will
that
help
is
that
what
you
have
to
hear
i
don't
i
don't
now
let
me
go
no
a
person
doesn't
just
wake
up
one
day
and
stop
loving
somebody
love
is
forever
i'm
not
afraid
to
use
it
i
swear
if
i
can't
be
with
you
oh
my
god
don't
walk
away
from
me
bitch
i
need
you
jenny
don't
don't
do
that
damn
it
don't
talk
to
me
like
i'm
some
dumb
what's
going
on
what's
going
on
you
just
shot
a
woman
and
this
this
is
the
garden
wow
look
jasmine
night
blooming
like
us
oh
angel
it's
fairyland
it's
paradise
big
windows
lovely
gardens
it'll
be
perfect
when
we
want
the
sunlight
to
kill
us
if
you
don't
like
it
spike
hit
the
stairs
and
go
take
a
stand
man
well
our
old
place
was
just
fine
till
you
went
and
had
it
burned
down
things
change
spikey
you
gotta
roll
with
the
punches
well
actually
you
pretty
much
got
that
part
down
haven't
you
very
funny
mate
what
can
i
say
i
just
love
to
see
you
smile
buddy
yeah
you're
a
giver
it
was
just
as
with
the
the
couple
you
encountered
the
other
night
buffy
the
the
janitor
remembered
everything
he
he
knew
he'd
killed
this
poor
woman
but
he
had
no
idea
why
well
theythey
had
no
intimate
relationship
what
about
the
gun
did
you
find
it
no
no
the
police
everybody
wewewewe
searched
high
and
low
i
think
it's
very
clear
what's
happening
here
fill
me
in
then
'cause
i've
read
the
book
seen
the
movie
and
i'm
still
fuzzy
about
what's
going
on
it's
jenny
what
you
think
she's
the
ghost
well
don't
you
see
well
shesheshe
died
here
under
tragic
circumstances
aaand
now
she's
trapped
but
what
about
the
gun
i
mean
angel
didn't
shoot
ms
the
gun
is
insignificant
it's
the
violence
of
the
thing
that
matters
i
don't
know
these
fights
these
couples
keep
having
it's
sort
of
specific
she's
right
it's
a
pattern
that
doesn't
fit
with
the
way
ms
yes
well
i
uh
i
appreciate
your
thoughts
on
the
matter
i
in
fact
i
well
i
encourage
you
to
to
always
uh
challenge
me
uh
when
you
feel
it's
appropriate
you
should
never
be
cowed
by
authority
except
of
course
in
this
instance
when
i
am
clearly
right
and
you
are
clearly
wrong
this
is
freaky
i
don't
ever
remember
ever
seeing
giles
be
this
weird
i
know
he's
usually
investigatethingsfromeveryboringangle
guy
now
he's
iclingontomyonelameidea
guy
what
gives
he
misses
her
he
can't
think
just
a
little
more
fallout
from
my
love
life
okay
but
this
ghost
stuff
is
something
else
let
me
do
a
crosscheck
on
other
shootings
at
the
school
yeah
we
need
some
alternate
ghost
theories
what
do
we
know
dog
spit
is
cleaner
than
human
besides
that
oh
boy
we
know
plenty
it
says
a
student
murdered
a
teacher
on
the
night
of
the
sadie
hawkins
dance
the
rumor
was
they
were
having
an
affair
and
she
tried
to
break
it
off
after
he
killed
her
he
went
into
the
music
room
and
shot
himself
ladies
and
gentlemen
we
have
a
ghost
it
is
one
of
those
two
right
it
all
fits
the
gun
the
sadie
hawkins
dance
which
is
tonight
how
come
we've
never
heard
about
this
murdersuicide
thing
before
when
did
it
happen
1955
how
did
you
know
okay
here's
the
new
strangeness
i
dreamt
about
this
woman
grace
newman
the
other
day
her
and
this
guy
jim
stanley
he's
the
one
he
did
it
your
dreams
are
getting
wicked
accurate
buff
you
wouldn't
happen
to
see
me
coming
across
some
big
cash
or
possibly
knowing
the
love
of
a
woman
in
a
full
body
sense
he
couldn't
make
her
love
him
so
he
killed
her
sicko
he
looks
so
normal
on
this
picture
he
was
smart
too
he
made
the
honor
roll
smart
he
killed
a
person
and
killed
himself
those
are
pretty
much
two
of
the
dumbest
things
you
could
do
i
know
but
well
don't
you
feel
kind
of
bad
for
them
sure
i
feel
lousy
for
her
he's
a
murderer
and
he
should
pay
for
it
with
his
life
no
he
should
be
doing
sixty
years
in
a
prison
breaking
rocks
and
making
special
friends
with
roscoe
the
weightlifter
yikes
the
quality
of
mercy
is
not
buffy
whose
ghost
do
you
think
we're
dealing
with
his
or
hers
well
considering
how
violent
it
is
i'm
gonna
say
his
that
tracks
well
i've
been
browsing
on
some
of
ms
calendar's
pagan
sites
maybe
i
can
find
a
way
to
communicate
with
them
and
we
can
find
out
what
he
wants
who
cares
what
he
wants
we
need
to
shut
him
down
before
some
other
innocent
guy
goes
and
kills
some
poor
nice
girl
and
then
blows
his
brains
out
all
over
the
music
room
wall
okay
who's
hungry
i
hope
you
guys
aren't
going
to
the
sadie
hawkins
dance
tonight
'cause
i'm
organizing
a
boycott
do
you
realize
that
the
girls
have
to
ask
the
guys
and
pay
and
everything
i
mean
whose
genius
idea
was
that
obviously
some
hairylegged
feminist
really
well
we
need
to
nip
this
thing
in
the
bud
i
mean
otherwise
things
are
going
to
get
really
scary
perfect
i'm
gonna
be
scarred
and
swollen
why
didn't
they
just
kill
me
schoolboy
pranks
never
sell
the
sewer
got
backed
up
better
i
can
probably
make
that
one
fly
but
this
is
getting
out
of
hand
people
will
talk
you'll
take
care
of
it
i'm
doing
everything
i
can
but
you
people
have
to
realize
snyder
what's
going
on
here
backed
up
sewer
line
same
thing
happened
in
san
diego
just
last
week
we're
on
a
hellmouth
sooner
or
later
people
are
gonna
figure
that
out
the
city
council
was
told
that
you
could
handle
this
job
if
you
feel
that
you
can't
perhaps
you'd
like
to
take
that
up
with
the
mayor
i'll
handle
it
i
will
remember
the
plan
to
contact
the
spirit
and
talk
to
it
scrap
that
plan
buffy
you
were
right
the
time
for
touchyfeely
communication
is
passed
i've
done
some
homework
and
found
the
only
solution
is
the
final
solution
nuke
the
school
i
like
that
not
quite
exorcism
are
you
crazy
i
saw
that
movie
even
the
priest
died
what's
the
deal
okay
see
here
the
balcony
that's
where
the
original
teacher
died
back
in
1955
and
that
teacher
last
night
that's
the
hot
spot
where
all
the
bad
mojo
is
coming
from
we
need
to
create
a
mangustripod
a
what
one
person
chants
here
on
the
hot
spot
and
the
other
three
chant
in
other
places
around
the
school
forming
a
triangle
it's
supposed
to
bind
the
bad
spirit
and
keep
it
from
doing
any
more
harm
well
i'll
take
the
hot
spot
if
there's
trouble
that's
where
it'll
be
this
ghost
this
james
guy
is
fixating
on
you
buffy
the
dreams
the
yearbook
you
sure
you
can
handle
it
well
i'm
hoping
he'll
show
i
truly
am
okay
we
all
have
our
places
we
do
the
chant
and
light
the
candle
at
midnight
exactly
any
questions
yeah
what
if
this
mangled
triangle
thingy
doesn't
work
oh
i
almost
forgot
i
made
us
all
scapulas
okay
so
we
can
flip
the
ghost
over
when
it
turns
a
nice
golden
brown
scapula
not
spatula
um
you
wear
it
around
your
neck
for
protection
you
expect
me
to
wear
this
it
smells
like
grandpa
breath
sorry
i
didn't
have
a
lot
of
time
i
had
to
use
sulfur
okay
let's
do
this
no
problem
this
will
be
a
piece
of
cake
right
maybe
i'll
sleep
underground
dig
myself
a
little
burrow
what
about
your
pretty
dress
sweet
it'll
get
all
dirty
then
i'll
sleep
naked
like
the
animals
do
you
know
i'm
suddenly
liking
this
plan
fortunately
nobody
cares
what
you
like
mate
oh
yeah
let's
ask
dru
there's
a
gate
it's
opening
incoming
i
love

she
does
this
what
gate
pet
what
do

see

black
it
wants
her

you

yyyou

be
in
the
line
of
fire
okay
'night
my
love
must
be
a
kind
of
blind
love
she
walks
toward
the
sound
and
through
a
pair
of
doors
i
can't
see
anyone
but
you
beyond
them
is
another
set
of
doors
to
the
music
room
a
class
of
'55
sadie
hawkins
dance
flyer
is
taped
to
one
of
the
door
windows
she
steps
over
to
the
other
door
and
looks
in
there
she
sees
james
and
grace
dancing
slowly
to
the
music
oh
yeah
baby
it's
snakalicious
in
here
the
moon
may
be
high
but
i
can't
see
a
thing
in
the
sky
when
james
turns
into
view
again
buffy
sees
that
his
face
is
all
rotted
'cause
i
only
have
eyes
for
you
buffy
stares
back
in
openmouthed
shock
james
and
grace
are
suddenly
gone
giles
willow
giles
giles
where
are
you
please
help
help
me
help
help
help
help
stop
just
calm
down
get
out
are
you
all
right
giles
jenny
could
never
be
this
mean
i
know
it's
it's
not
her
is
it
i'm
sorry
oh
god
oh
careful
up
here
i
shall
confront
and
expel
all
evil
i
shall
totally
confront
and
expel
all
evil
out
of
marrow
and
bone
out
of
house
and
home
never
to
come
here
again
oh
my
god
you
all
right
get
back
check
it
i'd
say
school's
out
for
good
the
good
news
is
none
of
you
girls
were
shot
well
we've
established
based
on
all
the
parallels
andandand
buffy's
visions
that
it's
james'
spirit
so
what
do
we
do
giles
about
james
well
he's
obviously
reliving
the
night
of
the
sadie
hawkins
dance
when
he
killed
ms
newman
itit'sit's
common
enough
for
a
spirit
to
do
this
to
recreate
a
a
tragedy
hey
if
sunnydale
high
school
shuts
down
forever
do
we
automatically
graduate
but
why
what
does
he
want
actually
that's
an
interesting
point
he's
he's
trying
to
resolve
whatever
issues
are
keeping
him
in
limbo
wwwhat
exactly
those
are
i'm
not
he
wants
forgiveness
yes
i
imagine
he
does
but
when
james
possesses
people
they
act
out
exactly
what
happened
that
night
so
he's
experiencing
a
form
of
purgatory
instead
i
mean
he's
he's
doomed
to
to
kill
his
ms
newman
over
and
over
and
over
again
and
forgiveness
is
impossible
good
he
doesn't
deserve
it
to
forgive
is
an
act
of
compassion
buffy
it's
it's
not
done
because
people
deserve
it
it's
done
because
they
need
it
no
james
destroyed
the
one
person
he
loved
the
most
in
a
moment
of
blind
passion
and
that's
not
something
you
forgive
no
matter
why
he
did
what
he
did
and
no
matter
if
he
knows
now
that
it
was
wrong
and
selfish
and
stupid
it
is
just
something
he's
gonna
have
to
live
with
he
can't
live
with
it
buff
he's
dead
okay
overidentify
much
i
need
you
so
what
do
we
do
next
do
we
go
in
again
well
not
now
no
the
uh
the
spirit
is
too
angry
too
too
powerful
no
we
have
to
work
out
exactly
how
and
and
if
this
thing
can
be
defeated
hey
buffy
are
you
oh
god
giles
she
went
back
so
what
now
not
even
a
megavat
of
raid's
gonna
do
the
trick
here
i
don't
get
it
is
she
trying
to
be
a
big
loner
hero
or
something
no
i
believe
she's
under
the
spirit's
thrall
he's
he's
calling
her
but
why
james
needs
her
to
reenact
everything
that
happened
on
the
night
that
he
he
killed
ms
newman
he
wants
to
change
things
make
make
a
happy
ending
but
it
can't
ever
happen
it
always
ends
the
same
which
means
buffy
just
went
in
there
to
get
shot
giles
yes
but
the
school's
deserted
there's
no
way
for
james
to
so
buffy
should
be
safe
until
we
find
a
way
to
get
her
out
in
theory
yeah
fun
fact
about
wasps
they
have
no
taste
for
the
undead
not
that
a
sting
would
do
me
any
damage
it's
just
tonight's
special
i
wanted
to
look
my
best
for
you
you're
the
only
one
the
only
person
i
can
talk
to
gosh
buff
that's
really
pathetic
you
can't
make
me
disappear
just
because
you
say
it's
over
actually
i
can
in
fact
i
just
want
you
to
be
able
to
have
some
kind
of
normal
life
we
can
never
have
that
don't
you
see
i
don't
give
a
damn
about
a
normal
life

about
you
every
minute
i
know
but
it's
over
it

to
be
come

to
hear

stupid
james
my
love

be
a
kind
of
blind
love
she
looks
over
into
a
mirror
and
james
looks
back
at
her
her
eyes
are
full
of
tears
as
she
looks
at
him
he
looks
down
at
the
gun
in
his
hand
i
can't
see
anyone
but
you
the
camera
pans
down
from
buffy's
face
to
the
gun
in
her
hand
she
raises
it
slowly
but
a
hand
takes
it
and
pushes
it
back
down
she
turns
and
finds
herself
face
to
face
with
angelus
grace

a
part
of
me
