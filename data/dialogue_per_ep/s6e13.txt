that's
it

my
girl
i
am
not
your
girl
you
don't
have
a
soul
there
is
nothing
good
or
clean
in
you
you
are
dead
inside
you
can't
feel
anything
real
i
could
never
be
your
girl
you
always
hurt
the
one
you
love
pet
buffy
buffy
no
no
statements
not
until
i
get
confirmation
excuse
me
ii
need
to
uh
i'll
be
with
you
in
a
sec
sunnydale
pd
yeah
the
phone's
ringing
off
the
hook
here
listen
you
got
an
id
on
that
body
yet
yeah
okay
shoot
katrina
silber
silber
warren
just
tell
her
to
go
away
i
can't
you're
keeping
secrets
from
me
other
girls
and
who
knows
what
else
trina
shut
up
warren
thanks
now
what's
the
problem
miss
is
this
what
you
saw
yeah
that's
it
mm
the
rwasundi
very
rare
um
its
presence
in
our
dimension
causes
a
sort
of
localized
temporal
disturbance
so
that's
why
time
went
all
david
lynch
right
uh
human
perception
is
based
on
a
linear
chronology
being
exposed
to
the
rwasundi
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
can
cause
uh
vivid
hallucinations
and
a
slight
tingly
scalp
so
that's
it
these
things
just
made
you
think
you
killed
her
she
was
probably
dead
long
before
you
stumbled
across
her
it
wasn't
the
demons
it
was
warren
he
knew
katrina
he
had
something
to
do
with
it
i
know
it
how
can
you
be
sure
you
always
hurt
the
one
you
love
does
this
mean
you're
not
going
away
yeah
i'm
not
going
anywhere
we
need
to
find
warren
and
the
others
whatever
they've
done
they're
not
gonna
get
away
with
it
we're
gonna
get
away
with
it
injuries
consistent
with
a
fall
suicide
willard
batts
the
coroner's
ruling
it
a
suicide
what
about
buffy
well
it
wasn't
that
hard
messing
her
game
up
if
she
figures
it
out
we'll
take
care
of
her
we
really
got
away
with
murder
that's
kinda
cool
yeah
cool
are
you
sure
ii've
double
checked
everything
there's
nothing
wrong
with
you
then
why
can
spike
hurt
me
well
i
said
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
you
but
you
are
different
shifting
you
out
of
fffrom
where
you
were
funneling
your
essence
back
into
your
body
iit
it
altered
you
on
a
basic
molecular
level
probably
just
enough
to
confuse
the
sensors
or
whatever
in
spike's
chip
but
it's
all
just
surfacey
physical
stuff
it
wouldn't
have
any
more
effect
than
a
bad
sunburn
i
didn't
come
back
wrong
no
you're
the
same
buffy
with
a
deep
tropical
cellular
tan
you
must
have
missed
something
will
you
check
again
buffy
ii
promise
there's
nothing
wrong
with
you
there
has
to
be
this
just
can't
be
me
it
isn't
me
why
do
i
feel
like
this
why
do
i
let
spike
do
those
things
to
me
you
mean
hit
you
oh
oh
huh
really
he's
everything
i
hate
he's
everything
that
i'm
supposed
to
be
against
but
the
only
time
that
i
ever
feel
anything
is
when
don't
tell
anyone
please
i
won't
the
way
they
would
look
at
me
i
just
couldn't
i
won't
tell
anyone

wouldn't
do
that
why
