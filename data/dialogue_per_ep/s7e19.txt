hey
you
hey
can
you
believe
this
mishegaas
yeah
you'd
think
these
people
had
never
seen
an
apocalypse
before
what
about
you
just
going
for
a
quick
spin
to
7eleven
in
nebraska
it's
getting
bad
here
really
bad
hellmouth
acting
up
again
people
feeling
it
getting
crazier
you
can't
swing
a
cat
without
hitting
some
kind
of
demonic
activity
not
that
i
swing
cats
or
eat—nope
heh
cuttin'
way
back
cholesterol—morals
i
mean
morals
right
we've
seen
some
bad
stuff
in
this
town
before
but
you
know
this
time
it's
like
it
just
seems
different
more
powerful
i
don't
think
anyone's
gonna
be
able
to
stop
it
i
mean
i'm
sure
you'll
do
fine
complete
confidence
in
you
heh
uh
if
anyone
can
do
it
you
can
because
yourock
if
you
save
the
world
i'll
come
back
we'll
have
drinks
when
when
i
mean
when
you
save
the
world
it's
gonna
be
great
with
all
the
rocking
maybe
maybe
you
should
just
get
out
of
town
this
time
yeah
i
probably
should
you
take
care
of
yourself
ok
bye
ah
thank
you
officer
we—we
appreciate
your
help
oh
no
thank
you
inspector
we
don't
get
a
lot
of
contact
with
interpol
so
we're
happy
to
help
you
with
anything
you
need
is
there
anything
else
we
can
help
with
no
thank
you
we're
fine
right
because—
wait
who
are—who
are
you
i'm
with
the
inspector
you're
with
the
inspector
right
well
we
don't
get
a
lot
of
contact
with
interpol
so—
a
single
step
stay
on
the
sidewalk
folks
a
single
step
and
it
is
upon
us
it
is
nigh
from
beneath
you
it—
freakin'
nutcase
ow
uh
people
are
acting
up
getting
nuts
man
you
just
let
us
know
if
you
need
help
with
your
guy
'cause
we
are
itching
to
hand
out
some
justice
he—he
doesn't
seem
like
much
of
a
threat
and—and
you
are
um
i
think
it's
time
we
were
catching
our
flight
to
um
interpol
right
ok
good
idea
my
control
was
fading
what's
up
with
those
cops
oh
same
as
everyone
the
hellmouth
is
active
again
come
on
i
want
to
get
back
to
xander
who
was
that
um
i—
i
don't
know
did
you
get
one
of
these
yet
no
what
is
that
fugitive
ran
to
ground
right
here
in
our
own
backyard
yeah
sounds
like
a
situation
that
needs
some
justice
and
that
you
should
expect
to
see
some
bruising
when
you
remove
the
bandages
bruising
around
the—
area
the
uh
bone
structure
and
musculature
was
hit
pretty
hard
ok
buffy
um
also
they
said
that
the—the
meds
may
cause
you
some
stomach
discomfort
so
we're
gonna
have
to
be
careful
with
your
diet
i
can't
taste
anything
right
now
anyway
i
keep
waiting
for
my
other
senses
to
improve
50
yeah
they
should
kick
in
any
day
now
well
we're
looking
at
a
possible
release
as
early
as
tonight
um
we're
just
waiting
for
your
labs
to
get
back
and
dr
kallet
said
that
should
be
a
couple
of
hours
that's
great
ok
um
i
think
we're
all
caught
up
then
thank
you
for
this
this
was
um
really
great
work
oh
i
thought
we
were
gonna
there
were
gonna
be
card
games
oh
no
i
just—
i
should
really
get
back
i
want
to
get
everyone
started
on
this
i
think
we're
really
close
to
something
it's
ok
it's
gotta
be
done
and
i
might
see
you
tonight
without
depth
perception
of
course
but
still
so
i
guess
you're
stuck
with
me
then
huh
let's
order
some
cherryflavored
offbrand
gelatin
and
then
i
think
we'll
be
up
for
a
rousing
game
of—
i
might
need
a
parrot
huh
well
to
go
with
the
eye
patch
to
really
complete
the
look
i
think
i
still
have
that
costume
from
halloween
yeah
and
don't
underestimate
the
impact
of
a
peg
leg
maybe
the
hospital
can
hook
you
up
with
a
nice
one
maybe
they
have
a
2bodyparts
for
the
price
of
one
kind
of
deal
oh
you
know
what
the
best
part
is
no
one
will
ever
make
me
watch
jaws
3d
again
yeah
and
you'll
never
have
to
oh
willow
please
don't
and
so
we
know
that
a
battle
is
coming
ubervamps
galore
we
also
know
that
the
ubervamps
are
hard
to
kill
hardtokill
but
i
have
been
out
talking
to
some
of
my
old
contacts
and
they've
provided
some
surprising
bits
of
news
yay
for
them
uhok
for
example
ubervamps
can
be
staked
right
through
the
heart
zing—poof
just
like
regular
vamps
umwe
didn't
know
this
of
course
these
guys
have
incredibly
strong
sternums
so
it's
a
lot
like
driving
a
wooden
stake
through
solid
steel
but
you
guys
are
all
superstrong
right
umno
right
ok
um
but
still
heart
information
still
good
to
know
since
holy
water
seems
to
run
off
these
guys
like
they've
been
scotchguarded
and
well
sunlight
would
work
but
guess
what—
they're
not
coming
out
during
the
daytime
uh
also
beware
of
their
uh
teeth
and
the
claws
they
use
to
shred
flesh
ok
you
know
what
i
used
to
be
really
afraid
of
these
ubervamp
guys
but
then
the
scary
preacher
blew
into
town
and
now
i'm
mostly
terrified
of
him
right
well
um
we're
working
on
getting
info
on
that
guy
why
bother
nothing
works
nothing
will
ok
i
know
you're
all
upset
and
i
myself
would
much
rather
be
sitting
at
the
bedside
of
my
oneeyed
exfiance
than
killing
time
here
with
you
people
in
this
overcrowded
and
might
i
add
increasingly
ripesmelling
basement
and
i
would
be
too
if
not
for
a
certain
awkward
discussion
he
and
i
recently
had
right
over
there
on
that
cot
immediately
following
some
exciting
and
unexpected
breakup
sex
buti
need
to
give
him
some
space
so
i'm
doing
what
i
can
do
contributing
any
way
i
can
and
so
will
all
of
you
you
still
need
to
know
this
information
we
can't
stop
just
because
something
else
is
trying
to
kill
you
too
you
got
enough
to
share
trade
ya
for
a
carton
of
cigarettes
and
some
soap
sorry
habit
shouldn't
you
be
down
at
hogwarts
probably
all
right
playin'
hooky
score
one
for
the
boarding
school
brat
anya's
technique's
probably
a
little
different
than
what
you're
used
to
do
you
think
there
are
gonna
be
questions
about
her
sex
life
on
the
test
'cause
i
really
hope
i
don't
have
to
study
all
that
yeah
whenever
she
starts
talking
about
getting
all
sweaty
with
xander
like
that
i
just
remind
her
i
had
him
first
shuts
her
right
the
hell
up
thing
is—
what's
the
point
studying
demon
hot
zones
and
pressure
points
doesn't
do
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
good
when
preacher
man's
out
there
ready
to
finish
the
job
he
started
no
one's
come
up
with
any
info
on
caleb
yet
no
nothing
is
working—not
research
not
anya's
contacts
we're
lousy
with
dead
ends
around
here
everyone's
feeling
pretty
pointless
we
don't
even
have
a
place
to
start
hey
who's
here
hey
buffy
how's
xander
he's
doing
really
well
he's
ready
to
come
home
i
think
whatcha
got
info
that
giles
and
willow
were
able
to
pull
off
the
police
database
we
figured
with
caleb's
you
know
overt
religiosity
thing
if
we
wanna
learn
more
about
him
let's
find
out
where
he's
been
incidents
of
violence
and
vandalism
connected
to
california
religious
institutions
in
the
last
10
years
looks
like
this
gives
us
a
place
to
start
yeah
i
figure
we
start
with
california
we
don't
find
anything
there
we'll
expand
the
search
but
a
guy
like
caleb
didn't
just
get
in
the
game
he's
been
playing
for
a
while
and
i
wanna
know
where
whatever
it
takes
you
good
to
help
well
i
was
gonna
do
lots
and
lots
of
homework
but
darn
the
luck
they
went
and
canceled
school
so
looks
like
i
got
the
time
good
hey
buffy
how
was
xander's
mood
you
know
exactly
and
did
you
get
a
chance
to
talk
to
the
doctor
about
the
meds
because
it
seemed
like—
hey
pipsqueak
why
don't
you
go
get
some
of
the
stuff
you've
already
gotten
from
giles
or
um
we
can
talk
about
this
later
maybe
ok
yeah
i'll
be
right
back
try
to
find
anything
that
looks
like
caleb
his
church
his
ring
his
ability
to
render
a
slayer
useless
in
just
one
punch
i
didn't—
that
was
stupid
i
don't
know
why
i
said
that
uh
it's
ok
umyou
know
i—i
have
to
go
to
the
school
to
pick
up
the
rest
of
my
stuff
i
really
didn't
mean—
it's
fine
really
it's
fine
don't
worry
about
it
hey
uh
isn't
anya
doing
that
thing
for
you
guys
today
yeah
we
were
we
probably
should
head
down
there
now
ok
i'll
be
back
soon
see
that
everyone
else
gets
started
on
this
yeah
oh
now
look
things
don't
go
exactly
your
way
so
here
come
the
waterworks
ain't
that
just
like
a
woman
get
out
of
here
now
now
little
girl
manners
i
do
imagine
that
firebrand
tongue
of
yours
has
inflamed
many
a
man
weak
as
they
are
this
here's
a
uh
public
school
ain't
it
kinda
deserted
only
just
i
suppose
folks
work
so
hard
at
keepin'
the
lord
out
and
look
what
happens
in
return
he
abandons
you
not
that
he
could
do
you
much
good
now
anyway—
ah
ah
ah
wouldn't
do
that
were
i
you
swee'pea
fightin'
back
didn't
do
you
much
good
last
time
did
it
and
how
is
poor
sweet
xander
let
him
know
he's
in
my
prayers
and
any
time
he's
willin'
i'm
ready
to
finish
the
job
go
near
xander
again
and
i
will
end
you
mind
your
manners
i
do
believe
i
did
warn
you
once
you're
angry
frustrated
scared
i
like
that
in
a
girl
you
really
should
relax
a
little
look
at
where
you
are
history's
gonna
look
back
at
you
at
me
at
this
place
and
they're
gonna
see
the
glory
great
things
are
happenin'
now
right
here
this
school
the
seal
it's
all
gonna
be
a
part
of
the
great
sweepin'
tide
of
change
and
you're
gonna
be
a
part
of
it
now
why
would
you
wanna
miss
that
more
importantly
why
would
you
want
to
get
in
its
way
i
guess
i'm
just
ornery
ha
ha
ha
oh
i
knew
you'd
be
a
wild
one—
i'm
gonna
take
such
sweet
pleasure
in
taming
you

little
lady

the
one
that

out

um
a
mission
up
north
in
gilroy
um
mr
giles
faith
stole
the
last
meatballandmozzarellaflavored
hot
pocket
out
of
the
freezer
even
though
i
had
called
dibs
on
it
i
don't
see
anything
exactly
no
vandalism
at
all
then
why
is
it
in
the
file
the
place
was
abandoned
um
locals
started
noticing
after
a
few
days
that
no
one
was
going
in
or
out
6
members
of
the
order
lived
there
but
when
the
cops
showed
up
all
gone
unsolved
yup
see
the
postit's
still
here
andrew's
please
do
not
eat
but
the
box
is
empty
now
oh
oh
oh
good
not
sure
here
see
it's
not
the
hot
pocket
itself—
even
though
it
did
have
that
newandimproved
thicker
tomato
sauce—
it's
just
the
fundamental
lack
of
respect
shut
up
pay
attention

am
i
looking
for
on
the

the
basement

caleb
sounded
like
there
was
news
what's
up
rupert
spike
i
have
a
mission
for
you
oh
really
'cause
you
know
sometimes
our
missions
end
up
with
you
trying
to
kill
me
i'm
not
fond
of
those
this
is
bona
fide
with
real
ramifications
take
a
look
at
this
looks
like
our
boy's
been
here
you
want
me
to
go
check
it
out
i
need
someone

care
of
themselves

left
some
souvenirs

we
gonna
get
to
the
foodstealing
issue
soon
take
andrew
what
well
you
are
always
saying
you
wanna
get
out
of
the
house
more
yeah
but—
there
may
be
demons
lurking
about
you
never
know
he's
a
demon
expert
he
can
help
oh
please
well
he
can
bring
his
pan
flute
thing
along
excellent
off
you
go
so
see
that's
something
right
we'll
have
some
news
soon
sure
maybe
that'll
get
us
somewhere
maybe
in
the
meantime
the
troops
here
gotta
sit
and
stew
feeling
crappier
by
the
minute
we
should
keep
them
occupied
yeah
i
know
how
to
keep
them
occupied
living
on
a
wing
and
a
prayer
out
on
the
strip
nobody
cares
scabbing
off
a
valley
chick
sleeping
on
the
practice
room
floor
pretty
soon
the
record
company
will
be
banging
on
your
door
what
kind
of
band
plays
during
an
apocalypse
i
think
this
band
might
actually
be
one
of
the
signs
rock
city
news
you
gotta
pay
your
dues
hey
guys
how's
it—
going
buffy
are
you
hurt
oh
caleb
came
back
looking
for
seconds
my
god
is
hhe—
still
able
to
make
me
see
cartoon
birdies
all
around
my
head
you
betcha
the
short
lack
of
consciousness
was
nice
i
feel
rested
sohow
did
those
police
files
work
out
were
they
helpful
uhuh
yes
very
much
so
i
think
um
there's
evidence
that
caleb
may
have
established
a
foothold
up
north
that's
great
that's—
i
um
i
sent
spike
to
look
into
it
spike
is
this
a
mission
from
which
you
intend
spike
to
return
alive
yes
i
sent
andrew
with
him
again
i
ask
the
question
buffy
you
weren't
here
decisions
have
to
be
made
in
your
absence
yeah
well
those
are
the
ones
that
have
been
scaring
me
i
did
what
i
thought
was
right
you
sent
away
the
one
person
that's
been
watching
my
back—again
we're
all
watching
your
back
funny
that's
not
really
what
it
feels
like
buffy—
where
did
everybody
go
what
faith
the
girls
where
are
they
umfaith
thought
that
the
girls
could
do
with
some
time
off
their
studies
i—i
thoughtshe
took
them
to
the
bronze
you
know
what
i
figured
out
tonight
every
high
school
in
this
country
from
one
end
to
the
other
smells
exactly
alike
now
why
do
you
suppose
that
is
and
how
was
our
best
girl
they
always
think
they
should
put
up
a
fight
did
you
lay
the
proper
groundwork
that
i
did
reckon
she
got
the
message
even
if
she
doesn't
know
it
yet
so
now
the
big
strong
slayer
goes
back
to
those
girls
she's
just
so
ready
to
walk
them
right
into
it
and
all
we
have
to
do
is
give
her
that
one
final
gentle
nudge
excellent
this
is
so
cool
buffy
would
never
let
us
do
this
you
are
so
cool
this
woman
is
so
cool
hey
hey
how
old
are
you
17
yeah
we're
gonna
get
you
a
real
nice
7up
ok
hey
i
was
wondering
what
was
taking
you
boys
so
long
where
you
been
we're
gonna
have
to
ask
you
to
come
with
us
miss
outstanding
warrants
yeah
or
we
could
try
this
one
on
instead
how
'bout
you
guys
buy
me
another
drink
and
we
see
where
the
evening
takes
us
hey
what's
going
on
it's
cool
i

nothin'

off
me
shut
up
i
tell
you
right
now
i'm
not
goin'
back
to
jail
who
said
anything
about
jail
stay
back
this
doesn't
concern
you
you
can't
keep
us
in
here
it'll
be
over
before
you
know
it
trust
me—the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
wait
here
don't
listen
to
him
he
won't
hurt
us
you
know
what
i'm
just
gonna
go
borrow
the
phone
best
thing
you
can
do
is
wait
here
you're
gonna
have
to
shoot
us
all
to
stop
us
it
doesn't
really
bother
me
these
cops
are
really
gettin'
hell
mouth
back
up
no
what
faith
what
are
you
doing
just
blowing
off
steam
well
it
started
that
way
turned
when
the
cops
went
evil
on
us
girls
go
home
i
need
to
talk
to
faith
for
a
minute
buffy
we
weren't—
dawn—
you
too
go
what
is
this
they
needed
a
break
all
right
they've
been
running
themselves
into
the
ground
things
just
got
out
of
hand
taking
a
break
is
one
thing—i
get
blowing
off
steam—but
they
were
fighting
and
those
girls
were
drunk
what
were
you
thinking
seemed
like
a
good
idea
at
the
time
yeah
what
if
someone
had
gotten
hurt
they
didn't
faith
i
need
to
know
that
these
girls
are
gonna
be
safe
when
i'm
not
around
no
one
got
hurt
b
look
you
don't
even
know
these
girls
maybe
you
should
have
a
little
more
confidence
in
'em
let
them
mess
up
sometimes
you
know
get
down
and
dirty
how
the
hell
else
are
they
gonna
learn
learning
from
your
mistakes
is
one
thing
but
you
don't
throw
children
into—
they're
not
children
that
really
isn't
the
point
yeah
what
about
the
vineyard
what
how
safe
were
they
when
you
dragged
them
off
to
meet
caleb
how
safe
was
rona
or
amanda
or
molly
you
sure
you
don't
wanna
stop
and
pick
up
some
burgers
or
something
you
know
road
trip
food
it's
not
a
road
trip
it's
a
covert
operation
right
right
gotcha
i—i
bet
even
covert
operatives
eat
curly
fries
they're
really
good
not
as
good
as
those
onion
blossom
things
ooh
i
love
those
yeah
me
too
it's
an
onion
and
it's
a
flower
i—i
don't
understand
how
such
a
thing
is
possible
see
the
genius
of
it
is
you
soak
it
in
ice
water
for
an
hour
so
it
holds
its
shape
then
you
deepfry
it
rootside
up
for
about
5
minutes
masterful
yeah
tell
anyone
we
had
this
conversation
i'll
bite
you
right
the
big
meeting
hasn't
started
yet
has
it
god
i
hope
so
faith
you
must
be
principal
wood
heard
a
lot
about
you
it
hasn't
really
started
yet
has
it
'cause
i
uh
i
hate
being
late
troops
are
still
gathering
i
think
you're
safe
looks
like
someone
banged
you
up
pretty
well
yeah
cops
mostly
mostly
yeah
this
one's
from
someone
who
just
thinks
she's
a
cop
it's
my
favorite
of
all
my
current
bruises
so
someone
who
thinks
she's
a
cop
huh
you
gonna
have
to
likeice
her
now
or
something
like
that
i'm
not
gonna
kill
her
wanted
to
but
didn't
by
the
way
bully
for
me
since
no
one
else
said
it
for
what
for
not
killing
buffy
it's
this
new
thing
i'm
tryin'
she
told
me
about
you
believe
every
word
so
what
changed
i
mean
why
didn't
you
fight
back
other
things
matter
more
i
think
you're
worried
about
her
i
think
you
need
to
brush
up
on
your
buffy
and
faith
history
all
right
if
you
say
so
but
i
read
people
pretty
well
it's
a
thing
i
do
you
uh
live
around
here
right
uh
no
not
exact—
well
it's
the
center
of
town
really
this
town
walking
anywhere
after
dark
is
like
an
extreme
sport
someone
who
didn't
know
you
very
well
might
think
you
were
out
lookin'
for
a
fight
or
something
maybe
you
got
bigger
issues
than
what's
wrong
with
b
i
read
people
too
xander's
home
no
one's
here
these
kinda
places
make
me
feel
funny
inside
i'll
buy
that
you
and
me
got
something
else
in
common
after
all
spike
oh
god
we
didn't
have
time
to
do
more
you
have
to
pretend
there's
a
big
party
here
that's
fine
parties
in
this
house
i
usually
end
up
having
to
rebuild
something
welcome
home
xander
i
wanted
you
to
be
here
for
this
i
think
you'll
be
interested
in
what
i
found
out
wwhat
did
you
find
out
iit's
about
the
cellar
look
i
know
that
night
wasn't
fun
for
any
of
us
but
i
figured
out
some
things
about
that
place
and
i
realize
now
what
we
have
to
do
we're
going
back
in
tell
me
about
the
mark
oh
hey
are
you
part
of
caleb's
faction
no
no
then
tell
me
what
happened
i
ccan't
can't
is
a
4letter
word
i'm
andrew
i'll
be
your
bad
cop
this
evening
you
don't
start
singing
my
associate
here—
we're
trying
to
fight
him
caleb
we
need
your
help
you
can't
fight
him
you
can't
stop
him
you
can
only
run
run
is
a
4letter
wor—
a
3letter
word
talk
i'll
do
better
i'll
show
you
one
night
some
time
ago
a
man
arrived
at
our
doors
and
you
said
come
in
do
some
damage
we
are—we
are
a
benevolent
order
and
yes
we
welcomed
him
we
offered
to
feed
him
but
he
had
come
for
something
else
behind
this
he
revealed
something
even
we
didn't
know
was
here
a
secret
room
he
was
excited
talking
the
whole
time
destiny
that
sort
of
thing
yeah
we
hear
he's
a
real
smooth
talker
he
was
going
on
about
this
ancient
inscription
neat
he
read
it
and
he
didn't
like
what
it
said
his
temper
he
was
the
purest
evil
i've
ever
seen
he
burned
his
mark
upon
me
and
then
i
ran
and
i
hid
and
i
listened
to
the
others
die
running
awaysaved
your
life
what
does
it
say
it
is
not
for
thee
it
is
for
her
alone
to
wield
look
i
know
what
you're
thinking
but
i
had
a
visit
at
the
school
today
from
caleb
buffy
why
didn't
you—
i'm
fine
i
mean
it
wasn't
fun
but
i'm
fine
i'm
better
than
fine
i—i
figured
something
out
he
kept
making
all
this
noise
about
the
school
is
it
that
seal
again
do
we
need
to
try
shutting
it
again
no
that's
just
it
we've
spent
all
this
time
worrying
about
the
seal
and
the
hellmouth
why
isn't
caleb
guarding
them
why
doesn't
he
have
someone
there
protecting
it
why
is
he
camped
out
at
the
vineyard
the
bad
guys
always
go
where
the
power
is
so
if
the
seal
was
so
important
to
caleb
and
the
first
they
would
be
there
right
now
they're
protecting
the
vineyard
or
something
at
the
vineyard
i
say
it's
their
power
and
i
say
it's
time
we
go
in
and
take
it
away
from
them
or
in
the
alternative
how
'boutwe
don't
i
mean
it's
a
neat
theory
b
but
i'm
not
going
back
in
that
place
not
without
proof
and
neither
should
you
and
neither
should
they
i'm
not
saying
it's
gonna
be
easy
i
think
faith
had
the
floor
maybe
it
ends
ok
the
way
you
wanna
play
it
but
maybe
it
doesn't
and
right
now
i
don't
think
i
want
you
playin'
the
odds
did
you
come
here
to
fight
listen
we're
fighters
all
of
us
but
you
gotta
give
me
something
to
fight
something
real
not—
windmills
there
is
something
there
maybe
but
we
can't
be
sure
of
that
this
is
a
hell
of
a
lot
to
ask
too
much
i—i
don't
understand
this
for
7
years
i've
kept
us
safe
by
doing
this—
exactly
this
making
the
hard
decisions
and
now
what—
suddenly
you're
all
acting
like
you
can't
trust
me
didn't
you
say
to
me
today
you
can't
trust
us
maybe
there's
something
there
that
should
be
addressed
is
that
why
you
sent
spike
away
to
ambush
me
oh
come
on
you
know
what
i
am
sick
of
your
deal
with
this
spike
guy
this
isn't
about
him
this
is
about
you
you're
being
reckless
what
you
are
i
don't
even
know
you
and
i
can
tell
you
are
so
obsessed
with
beating
caleb
you
are
willing
to
jump
into
any
plan
without
thinking
that's
not
what
i'm
doing
well
that's
how
it
feels
to
us
people
are
dying
kennedy
why
are
you
always
standing
up
for
her
i'm
not
what
do
you
mean
you're
not
with
everything
that's
happened
i—
i'm
worried
about
your
judgment
look
i
wish
this
could
be
a
democracy
i
really
do
democracies
don't
win
battles
it's
a
hard
truth
but
there
has
to
be
a
single
voice
you
need
someone
to
issue
orders
and
be
reckless
sometimes
and
not
take
your
feelings
into
account
you
need
someone
to
lead
you
and
it's
automatically
you
you
really
do
think
you're
better
than
we
are
no
i—
but
we
don't
know
we
don't
know
if
you're
actually
better
i
mean
you
came
into
the
world
with
certain
advantages
sure
i
mean
that's
the
legacy
i—
anya
but
you
didn't
earn
it
you
didn't
work
for
it
you've
never
had
anybody
come
up
to
you
and
say
you
deserve
these
things
more
than
anyone
else
they
were
just
handed
to
you
so
that
doesn't
make
you
better
than
us
it
makes
you
luckier
than
us
i've
gotten
us
this
far
but
not
without
a
price
xander—
i'm
trying
to
see
your
point
here
buff
but
i
guess
it
must
be
a
little
bit
to
my
left
'cause
i
just
don't
look
i'm
willing
to
talk
strategy
ok
i'll
hear
suggestions
on
how
to
break
this
down
but
this
is
the
plan
we
have
to
be
together
on
this
or
we
will
fail
again
we
are
clearly
demonstrating
that
we
are
not
together
on
this
which
is
why
you
have
to
fall
in
line
i'm
still
in
charge
here
why
is
that
exactly
because
i'm
the
slayer
and
isn't
faith
a
slayer
too
what
whoa
whoa
whoa
so
not
what
i
meant
i'm
not
in
charge
chick
i
think
b
here
needs
to
justchill
out
for
a
little
bit
take
a
siesta
or
something
but
i'm
not
the
one
you
want
maybe
we
need
a
vote
to
see
who
wants
faith
to
have
a
turn
in
charge
no
no
what
no
you
don't
get
to
vote
until
i've
had
my
chance
to
pal
around
you
know
get
everybody
drunk
see
i
didn't
get
this
was
a
popularity
contest
i
should
have
equal
time
to
bake
them
cookies
braid
their
hair—
learn
their
names
you're
just
lovin'
this
aren't
you
you
have
no
idea
what
i'm
feeling
come
in
here
take
everything
that
i
have
you

you
tell
them
that
did
you
tell
them
how
you
used
to
kill
people
for
fun
hey
you
guys
think
that's
nifty
buffy
that's
enough
i
didn't
come
here
to
take
anything
away
from
you
but
i'm
not
gonna
be
your
little
lapdog
either
i
came
here
to
beat
the
other
guy
to
do
right
however
it
works
i
don't
know
if
i
can
lead
but
the
real
question
iscan
you
follow
so
we
vote

guys—
i
can't
watch
you
just
throw
away
everything
that—
i
know
i'm
right
about
this
i
just
need
a
little—
i
can't
stay
here
and
watch
her
lead
you
into
some
disaster
then
you
can't
stay
here
buffy
i
love
you
but
you
were
right
we
have
to
be
together
on
this
you
can't
be
a
part
of
it
so
i
need
you
to
leave
i'm
sorry
but
this
is
my
house
too
ding
dong
the
witch
is
dead
shut
your
mouth

i
swear
i
didn't
want
it
to
go
this
way—
don't
i
mean
it
i—
don'tbe
afraid
to
lead
them
whether
you
wanted
it
or
not
their
lives
are
yours
it's
only
gonna
get
harder
protect
them
but
lead
them
