do
you
like
cats
i'm
more
of
a
dog
person
myself
but
i'm
not
like
death
to
all
cats
why
'cause
i
was
thinking
of
getting
one
can
you
have
one
in
the
dorms
no
but
this
would
be
a
sneaky
cat
that
would
be
cool
you
mean
it'd
be
sort
of
like
a
familiar
actually
ii
was
thinking
it
would
be
sort
of
like
a
pet
you
know
we
could
we
could
name
her
trixie
or
miss
kitty
fantastico
or
something
and
we
could
make
kitty
go
bonkers
with
string
and
catnip
and
stuff
absolutely
fun
i'm
in
so
you're
not
allergic
or
anything
nope
good
cause
i
want
my
room
to
be
willowfriendly
me
too
so
i'm
excited
about
the
scooby
meeting
i
think
what's
it
about
i'm
not
sure
probably
just
your
gardenvariety
disaster
zippo
patrol's
been
totally
uneventful
my
kill
count's
way
down
she
means
there's
been
less
badguy
activity
well
we
know
what
that
often
indicates
buffy
doesn't
make
her
quota
bad
slayer
well
i
wish
it
were
that
innocuous
but
with
adam
around
i
feel
he's
involved
somehow
when
things
get
slow
it's
usually
because
there's
some
extra
evil
brewing
except
the
weird
thing
is
we've
been
busy
at
the
initiative
our
squads
are
pulling
a
lot
more
captures
we
got
demons
coming
out
our
ears
that's
a
metaphor
i
got
it
thanks
i'm
overhelping
aren't
i
so
the
activity's
shifted
but
not
stopped
that's
fascinating
to
an
extremely
bored
person
maybe
well
that
was
a
thrilling
hour
you
know
i
really
don't
appreciate
your
snide
remarks
anya
now
i
have
a
great
deal
of
experience
in
these
matters
and
if
i
say
there
is
a
matter
of
some
import
brewing
ii
hey
oz
oz
when
when
did
you
get
back
pretty
much
now
oz
man

to
sound
grandma
but

your
place

great
to
see
you

so
um
i
was
missing
something
this
afternoon
wasn't
i
i
mean
breakups
are
tough
but
when
oz
walked
in
it
seemed
like
emotions
were
running
extra
high
oz
and
willow
had
a
rough
breakup
grr
hold
that
thought
man
that
was
record
time
it's
no
fun
when
they're
that
easy
speak
for
yourself
base
this
is
agent
finn
we've
an
hst
down
please
send
a
retrieval
team
to
sector
72
finn
we'll
get
there
as
soon
as
we
can
so
i
was
just
about
to
say
something
fascinating
oz
and
willow
right
they
had
a
rough
breakup
some
stuff
came
up
and
oz
pretty
much
bailed
overnight
it
left
will
really
devastated
i
remember
the
thing
is
before
that
they
were
doing
great
i
mean
she
was
totally
dealing
with
oz
being
a
werewolf
it
wasn't
even
whoa
wait
oz
is
a
werewolf
and
willow
was
dating
him
yes
hence
the
high
emotions
you're
kidding
me
gotta
say
i'm
surprised
i
didn't
think
willow
was
that
kind
of
girl
what
kind
of
girl
into
dangerous
guys
she
seems
smarter
than
that
oz
is
not
dangerous
something
happened
to
him
that
wasn't
his
fault
god
i
never
knew
you
were
such
a
bigot
whoa
hey
how
did
we
get
to
bigot
i'm
just
saying
it's
a
little
weird
to
date
someone
who
tries
to
eat
you
once
a
month
yeah
well
love
isn't
logical
riley
it's
not
like
you
can
be
mister
joe
sensible
about
it
all
the
time
god
knows
i
haven't
been
i'm
not
talking
about
you
how
about
we
don't
talk
about
this
at
all
okay

just
patrol

i
want
you
to
come
outside

a
different
person
than
when

that's
why
i'm
here

your
favorite
well
it's
where
i
stayed
the
longest
this
warlock
in
romania
sent
me
to
the
monks
there
to
learn
some
meditation
techniques
very
intense
all
about
keeping
your
inner
cool
good
'cause

a
spaz
before

that's
it
you
keep
your
cool
and

i
have
well
there

yeah
i
know
i
don't
wanna
hurt
anyone
buffy
no
matter
what
somebody's
gonna
get
hurt
and
the
important
thing
is
you
just
have
to
be
honest
or
it's
gonna
be
a
lot
worse
from
the
sound
of
those
massive
mud
flaps
i'd
peg
you
as
a
demon
which
means
you're
in
for
a
world
of
pain
spike
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
do
you
well
let's
go

my
problem

that
exactly
i'm
going
to
help
you
with
yours
hi
hi
i
can
only
stay
for
a
minute
i
have
class
me
too
iii
have
class
too
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
what
you
saw
this
morning
it
wasn't
no
it's
okay
ii
always
knew
that
if
he
came
back
we
were
just
talking
nothing
happened
oh
really
but
you
know
it
was
intense
just
talking
we
have
a
lot
to
talk
about
i
kinda
feel
like
my
head's
gonna
explode
whatever
you
know
happens
i'll
still
be
here
i'll
still
be
your
friend
of
course
we'll
be
friends
that's
not
even
a
question
but
i'm
saying
i
know
what
oz
means
to
you
how
can
you
when
i'm
not
even
sure
i
mean
i
know
what
he
meant
to
me
but
he
left
and
everything
changed
i
changed
and
then
we
what
i
don't
know
i
just
life
was
starting
to
get
so
good
again
and

you're
a
big
part
of
that
and
here
comes
the
thing
i
wanted
most
of
all
and
i
don't
know
what
to
do
i
i
wanna
know
but
i
don't
do
what
makes
you
hhhappy
hey
i
thought
i
smah
heard
willow
hey
you're
um
you're
coming
back
to
school
here
huh
pretty
much
feeling
oddly
motivated
that's
um
that's
great
i
mean
that's
that's
great
for
you
and
willow
right
i
hope
so
good
that's
because
is
that
her
sweater
i
just
i
just
hope
that
you
guys'll
be
very
happy
you
smell
like
her
she's
all
over
you
do
you
know
that
i
can't
ii
can't
talk
about
this
but
there's
something
to
talk
about
are
you
two
involved
i
have
i
i
i
have
to
go
'cause
she
never
said
anything
to
me
like
that
we
talked
all
night
and
she
never
no
stop
is
she
in
love
with
you
tell
me
is
she
run
are
you
okay
what's
going
on
we'll
take
it
from
here
this
thing
looks
like
it
may
be
one
of
the
demons
that
took
out
graham's
guys
the
other
night
we'll
take
it
back
we'll
make
an
id
if
it
is
we'll
put
him
down
you
don't
understand
that's

listen
we
know
what
we're
doing
you're
in
shock
but
we'll
handle
it
no
well
that
sounds
like
a
lot
of
fun
you
see
my
problem
though
total
annihilation
of
the
humans
doesn't
help
me
i'll
be
needing
heavy
casualties
on
both
sides
i
get
that
i'm
still
not
sure
how
the
slayer
fits
in
the
humans
need
a
leader
a
champion
the
slayer
can
do
that
yeah
the
thing
about
the
slayer
is
she
is
a
whiny
little
thing
but
when
it
comes
to
the
fighting
she
does
have
a
slight
tendency
to
win
then
i
guess
you
should
be
on
her
side
this
all
goes
down
the
chip
comes
out
yeah
no
tricks
scout's
honor
you
were
a
boy
scout
parts
of
me
what's
up
you
okay
oz
we
were
talking
and
he
changed
right
in
front
of
me
what
it's
daylight
i
know
but
it
happened
oh
my
god
are
you
all
right
i'm
fine
riley
and
the
commando
guys
they
stopped
him
but
they
don't
know
it's
oz
i
tried
to
tell
them
but
they
took
him
away
when
just
now
i
think
they
might
hurt
him
i
i
have
to
go
i
have
to
find
buffy
i
know
tara
said
they
took
him
right
before
she
found
me
so
that's
good
right
i
mean
they
probably
haven't
had
time
to
eviscerate
him
yet
an
you
can
help
by
making
this
a
quiet
time
once
again
we're
faced
with
a
fairly
daunting
prospect
of
having
to
infiltrate
the
initiative
it'd
be
great
if
we
knew
someone
dating
a
man
on
the
inside
someone
with
connections
oh
wait
he's
still
not
answering
his
pages
i
left
him
another
message
so
what
do
we
do
well
we
need
to
move
fast
so
we
make
a
plan
without
riley
and
hope
he
calls
what's
the
word
doc
is
this
the
animal
that
took
apart
our
men
we
don't
know
yet
soldier
what's
the
holdup
i
thought
graham
gave
you
a
full
description
the
holdup
is
that
he
described
characteristics
present
in
over
40
known
varieties
of
demon
so
we're
crosschecking
dna
evidence
hair
fibers
and
how
long
is
that
gonna
take
i
have
no
idea
i
don't
need
a
bunch
of
tests
to
know
that
this
thing's
a
killer
hey
he's
coming
to
oz
he
won't
be
able
to
talk
for
a
while
we
gave
him
haldol
to
keep
him
quiet
why
he's
not
a
threat
now
i
allowed
you
to
stay
as
long
as
you
let
us
do
our
work
agent
finn
only
colonel
mcnamara
can
place
a
cease
order
on
medical
testing
and
he's
told
us
to
proceed
i
always
suspected
that
stuff
about
werewolf
transformations
being
based
on
a
lunar
cycle
was
campfire
talk
oh
hey
that's
enough
come
on
the
guy's
a
student
i
know
him
take
him
out
yes
sir
see
that
transformation
related
to
negative
stimulation
something's
wrong
riley
usually
returns
my
phone
calls
by
now
we
can't
wait
much
longer
i
know
okay
xander
you
and
i
are
gonna
go
in
we've
done
it
before
i'm
going
with
you
no
look
it's
too
dangerous
will
besides
i
need
you
to
help
giles
hack
into
the
city's
electrical
grid
we've
gotta
try
to
power
down
the
initiative
giles
can
do
it
without
me
i
can
give
him
all
the
instructions
i
can
show
him
exactly
what
to
do
of
course
ii
can't
just
sit
here
okay
okay
you
can
back
us
up
now
the
only
way
i
know
into
the
initiative
is
through
the
elevator

william
burroughs

let's
go
you're
a
dead
man
finn
no
sir
i'm
an
anarchist
i
hope
everybody
else
is
okay
it
was
better
to
split
up
right
i
mean
we're
just
too
findable
in
a
big
clump
it
was
better
besides
i
think
it's
mostly
me
the
initiative
wants
now
probably
so
what
should
we
do
we'll
be
safe
for
tonight
at
least
the
campus
is
still
blacked
out
so
that
oughta
slow
the
initiative
down
i'll
figure
out
my
next
move
tomorrow
quite
a
day
huh
you
woke
up
to
a
big
bowl
of
wheaties
now
you're
a
fugitive
i
don't
know
i'm
sorry
it
ended
that
way
but
i
am
glad
it's
done
i'm
glad
i
know
where
i
stand
finally
i
was
wrong
about
oz
i
was
being
a
bigot
no
you
weren't
you
were
thrown
you
found
out
that
willow
was
in
kind
of
an
unconventional
relationship
and
it
gave
you
a
momentary
wiggins
it
happens
still
i
was
in
a
totally
black
and
white
space
people
versus
monsters
and
it
ain't
like
that
especially
when
it
comes
to
love
i
have
to
tell
you
some
stuff
about
my
past
and
it's
not
all
stuff
that
you're
gonna
like
you
can
tell
me
anything
i
think
so
i
think
i
can
this
thing
looks
pretty
good
considering
you
drove
it
overseas
well
it
broke
down
outside
of
mexico
and
i
traded
my
bass
to
have
it
fixed
and
garaged
i
shouldn't
have
come
back
now
i
just
thought
i'd
changed
you
have
changed
you
stopped
the
wolf
from
coming
out
i
saw
it
but
i
couldn't
look
at
you
i
mean
it
turns
out
the
one
thing
that
brings
it
out
in
me
is
you
which
falls
under
the
heading
of
ironic
in
my
book
it
was
my
fault
i
upset
you
well
so
we're
safe
then
'cause
you'll
never
do
that
again
but
you're
happy
i
am
i
can't
explain
it
it
may
be
safer
for
both
of
us
if
you
don't
i
missed
you
oz
i
wrote
you
so
many
letters
but
i
didn't
have
any
place
to
send
them
you
know
i
couldn't
live
like
that
it
was
stupid
to
think
that
you'd
just
be
waiting
i
was
waiting
i
feel
like
some
part
of
me
will
always
be
waiting
for
you
like
if
i'm
old
and
bluehaired
and
i
turn
the
corner
in
istanbul
and
there
you
are
i
won't
be
surprised
because
you're
with
me
you
know
i
know
but
now
is
not
that
time
i
guess
no
what
are
you
gonna
do
i
think
i
better
take
off
when
pretty
much
now
no
candles
well
i
brought
one
it's
extra
flamey
tara
i
have
to
tell
you
no
ii
understand
you
have
to
be
with
the
person
you
llove
i
am
you
mean
i
mean
okay
oh
yes
i
feel
horrible
about
everything
i
put
you
through
aand
i'm
gonna
make
it
up
to
you
starting
right
now
right
now
