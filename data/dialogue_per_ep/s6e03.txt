she'll
be
there

the
fastest
way

i've
done
a
lot
of
fleeing
on
these
mean
streets
i
know
all
the
shortcuts
i
don't
like
this
look
fire
fire
is
rarely
a
sign
of
imminent
safety
i
wish
we
were
there
already
hey
hey
don't
worry

fine
my
senses

nothing's
gonna
i'm

four
four
limbs
well
at
least
the
demons
almost
hit
you
on
the
way
out
of

their
leader's
gone

seem
to
be
making
with
the
big
skedaddle
iit
was
buffy
right
we
we
saw
her
and
it
was
really
buffy
i
think
we
screwed
it
up
she's
broken
no
she's
not
broken
she's
just
disoriented
from
being
tormented
in
some
hell
dimension
probably
tortured
and
it's
like
we
don't
even
know
how
much
time
has
passed
there
for
her
uh
possibly
years
that's
not
something
you
just
get
over
oh
my
god
what
if
she
never
gets
over
it
and
you
think
of
this
now

are
you
thinking

she's
not
right

she
she's
fine
normal
she
used

wrong
i
don't
think
she's
particularly
normal
at
all
well
she

it
time
i
bet
in

week
she'll
be
our
little
bufferin
again
oh
yes
cause
six
or
seven
days
that's
all
you
really
need
to
get
over
eternal
hell
experiences
who's
that
spike
what
are
you
doing
out
here
i
hope
you're
not
going
to
start
your
little
obsession
now
that
she's
around
again
hey
you
didn't
tell
me
you
brought
her
back
and
you
didn't
tell
me
well
now
you
know
i
worked
beside
you
all
summer
we
didn't
tell
you
it
was
just
we
didn't
okay
listen
i've
figured
it
out
maybe
you
haven't
but
i
have
willow
knew
there
was
a
chance
that
she'd
come
back
wrong
so
wrong
that
you'd
have
that
she
would
have
to
get
rid
of
what
came
back
and
i
wouldn't
let
her
if
any
part
of
that
was
buffy
i
wouldn't
let
her
and
that's
why
she
shut
me
out
what
are
you
talking
about
willow
wouldn't
do
that
oh
is
that
right
look
you're
just
covering
don't
tell
me
you're
not
happy
look
me
in
the
eyes
and
tell
me
when
you
saw
buffy
alive
that
wasn't
the
happiest
moment
of
your
entire
existence
that's
the
thing
about
magic
there's
always
consequences
always
hey
did
you
get
through
to
london
yeah
he's
gonna
head
back
as
soon
as
he
can
i'm
not
sure
like
maybe
a
couple
days
how
did
he
take
it
um
i'm
not
sure
i
mean
glad
but
kinda
weirded
out
which
i
get
you
know
lots
of
dear
lords
and
i
think
i
actually
heard
him
cleaning
his
glasses
are
you
worried
worried
tara
it
worked
fine
it's
all
good
hey
will
this
is
me
it
doesn't
all
have
to
be
good
and
fine
this
is
the
room
where
you
don't
have
to
be
brave
i
still
love
you
if
you're
worried
you
can
be
worried
well
i'm
not
unworried
i
mean
what
what
happened
that
was
intense
that's
gotta
change
you
when
angel
came
back
buffy
said
he
was
wild
like
an
animal
buffy's
not
like
that
yeah
but
it's
just
kinda
noisy
up
here
tonight
you
know
yeah
is
this
better
yeah
i
think
it
makes
things
quieter
in
here
you
know
what
i
think
i
think
we
all
just
assumed
crash
positions
huh
it's
it's
it's
like
we
were
all
tensed
up
like
we
were
expecting
it
to
screw
up
we
weren't
prepared
for
it
to
actually
go
right
yeah
tara
yeah
if
things
did
go
right
wouldn't
you
think
she'd
be
happier
like
wouldn't
you
think
she
would
be
so
happy
that
we
brought
her
out
sure
she
is
you
thought
she'd
say
thanks
be
more
grateful
would
i
be
a
terrible
person
if
i
said
yes
give
her
time
she'll
get
there
right
no
need
to
be
in
a
big
furry
hurry
exactly
i'm
sure
it's
okay
buffy
what
did
you
do
do
you
know
what
you
did
you're
like
children
your
hands
smell
of
death
bitches
filthy
little
bitches
rattling
the
bones
did
you
cut
the
throat
did
you
pat
its
head
the
blood
dried
on
your
hands
didn't
it
oh
my
god
oh
my
god

were
stained
you
still
are
i
know
what
you
did
the
glass
there's
no
glass
okay
what
in
the
frilly
heck
is
going
on
maybe
we
dreamed
it
right
right
wrong
different
brains
oh
yeah
well
what
was
it
talking
about
did
you
understand
it
well
i
understood
the
words
but
no
hat
was
that
there's
there's
something
in
the
house
what
is
it
after
is
it
buffy
i
don't

it
i'm
gonna
call
i
hope
xander's
up
xander
are
you
up
i
can't
sleep
play
a
word
game
with
me
xander
are
you
awake
okay
i'm
going
to
describe
an
adjective
with
accurate
but
misleading
clues
and
then
you
have
to
guess
what
it
is
xander
xander
huh
what
do
what
that
oughta
do
it
hello
xander
it's
me
willow
we
were
just
attacked
attacked
a
vampire
no
it
was
buffy
or
something
that
looked
like
her
like
she
was
possessed
and
then
she
just
disappeared
aand
and
we
saw
something
a
little
there's
something
in
the
house
in
the
house
all
right
willow
you
need
to
get
out
of
there
just
get
everyone
out
wake
up
buffy
and
dawn
don't
make
a
big
deal
gah
anya
anya
xander
xander
very
bad
very
very
very
bad
bad
he's
all
traumatized
well
whatever
it
is
it's
not
the
the
traditional
haunting
because
iit's
not
limited
to
one
specific
place
and
there's
not
you
know
a
dead
person
not
any
more
i
bet
it's
a
hitchhiker
a
hitchhiker
um
standard
way
to
travel
through
dimensions
uh
some
demonthing
sees
someone
moving
between
worlds
and
grabs
on
for
the
ride
you
mean
like
some
hellbeastie
rode
in
with
buffy
like
we're
responsible
for
this
assume
crash
positions
i
think
we
shouldn't've
brought
buffy
back
i
knew
it
was
going
to
end
badly
i
should've
said
something
okay
fine
but
what
are
we
gonna
do
i
mean
i'm
feeling
the
need
for
some
vigorous
doing
you
know
it's
okay
we
we
just
kill
the
beastie
and
then
all
is
good
we're
rolling
in
puppies
right
can
we
do
that
kill
it
we
killing
something
buffy
you're
not
supposed
to
be
up
how
how
are
you
feeling
are
you
okay
so
what
are
we
killing
a
demon
you
brought
back
from
hell
with
you
oh
it's
not
like
she's
making
it
sound
a
little
hauntingtype
stuff
booscary
everything's
normal
you
shouldn't
worry
about
it
um
i
remember
something
last
night
uh
buff
um
the
photographs
oof
us
they
changed
how
did
they
change
they
were
dead
iii
mean
we
were
dead
like
um
dead
bodies
but
but
then
they
were
okay
so
i
just
you
know
figured
it
was
me
that
i
was
going
crazy
well
maybe
you
are
going
crazy
from
hell
no
you're
fine
you
are
and
buffy
we're
we're
so
glad
yeah
this
thing
this
haunting
thing
we'll
fix
it
and
then
we'll
still
have
you
back
which
is
it's
so
important
yes
it's
wonderful
we
should
get
to
work
what's
the
list
possible
hitchhikers
demons
that
might
have
come
out
of
hell
at
the
same
time
buffy
did
skaggmore
demons
trellbane
demons
skitterers
large
and
small
boneeaters
if
we
get
to
pick
i
say
we
go
with
the
small
boneeaters
well
that
just
means
they
prefer
to
eat
things
with
small
bones
like
you
that's
just
what
we
have
so
far
five
species
of
demons
that
have
been
known
to
move
transdimensionally
two
of
them
may
be
invisible
in
this
dimension
and
uh
two
others
can
perform
spells
to
alter
perception
well
that's
four
what's
the
other
one
like
uh
like
the
others
only
dripping
with
viscous
fluid
eww
so
should
we
concentrate
on
how
to
kill
those
or
should
we
try
to
find
more
i'm
not
sure
maybe
maybe
some
of
us
can
uh
keep
going
finding
more
and
the
others
i
miss
giles
oh
he's
coming
back
i
talked
to
him
i
know
i'm
a
kind
of
poor
substitute
but
until
then
we'll
get
it
done
i
think
i
should
patrol
well
i
know
we'll
find
something
soon
yeah
uh
do
you
want
us
to
go
with
you
we
can
do
that
no
ii
need
to
go
sorry
you
should
go
i'll
be
safe
here
with
the
others
don't
worry
about
me
i
found
one
of
those
24hour
places
for
coffee
remember
that
bookstore
well
they
became
one
of
those
booksandcoffee
places
and
now
they're
just
coffee
it's
like
evolution
only
without
the
gettingbetter
part
uh
coffee
coffee
coffee
um
hot
chocolate
for
dawn
you're
too
young
for
coffee
idiot
you
can
have
my
coffee
all
of
you
did
it
you
stupid
children
did
you
think
the
blood
wouldn't
reach
you
i
smell
the
death
on
you
look
at
what
you've
done
fire
fire
fire
dawn
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
that
was
it
lilike
buffy
with
fire
is
she
okay
did
i
look
like
that
i
hope
i
didn't
look
like
that
no
i'm
sure
you
looked
really
glamorous
cutting
up
your
face
what
what
is
it
what's
happening
you'll
be
okay
i
bet
you'll
experience
some
drymouth
fire
was
it
did
the
demon
thing
have
me
it's
okay
it's
okay
yeah
it's
gone
yes
but
where
did
it
go
i
mean
evil
things
have
plans
they
have
things
to
do
buffy
you
should
be
careful
never
know
what
kind
of
villain's
got
a
knife
at
your
back
your
hand
is
hurt
hmm
same
with
you
right
willow's
getting
pretty
strong
isn't
she
bringing
you
back
it's
hard
to
get
a
good
night's
death
around
here
you
can
sit
down
got
furniture
you
should
see
the
downstairs
too
it's
quite
posh
uh
i
do
remember
what
i
said
the
promise
to
protect
her
if
i
had
done
that
even
if
i
didn't
make
it
you
wouldn't
have
had
to
jump
but
i
want
you
to
know
i
did
save
you
not
when
it
counted
of
course
but
after
that
every
night
after
that
i'd
see
it
all
again
do
something
different
faster
or
more
clever
you
know
dozens
of
times
lots
of
different
ways

every
night
i
save
you
it's
getting
light
out
buffy's
probably
on
her
way
home
from
patrolling
i
like
sunrise
better
when
i'm
getting
up
early
than
when
i'm
staying
up
late
you
know
it's
like
i'm
seeing
it
from
the
wrong
side
hey
tara
this
is
probably
crazy
but
spike
got
me
to
thinking
this
spell
we
did
it's
having
consequences
isn't
it
i
mean
it
sure
seems
like
it
and
i
was
just
wondering
did
you
know
that
this
might
happen
no
do
you
think
could
someone
have
known
willow
is
a
talented
witch
and
she
would
never
do
anything
to
hurt
anyone
i
know
i
know
huh
backing
off
quickly
hands
in
the
air
i
just
meant
thaumogenesis
she's
possessed
thaumogenesis
you're
right
i'm
not
possessed
ii
think
i
figured
it
out
this
demon
iit's
not
a
demon
we
let
out
it's
it's
a
demon
that
we
made
we
made
a
demon
bad
us
thaumogenesis
is
when
doing
a
spell
actually
creates
a
being
in
this
case
it
was
like
a
a
sideeffect
i
guess
like
a
price
what
think
of
it
like
the
world
doesn't
like
you
getting
something
for
free
and
we
asked
for
this
huge
gift
buffy
aand
so
the
world
said
'fine
but
if
you
have
that
you
have
to
take
this
too'
and
it
made
the
demon
well
technically
that's
not
a
price
that's
a
gift
with
purchase
um
but
if
we
made
the
demon
how
come
we
can't
see
it
i
mean
all
we
see
is
us
doing
stuff
well
i
i
think
it's
out
of
phase
with
this
dimension
like
its
consciousness
is
here
but
but
its
body
is
caught
in
the
ether
between
existing
and
not
existing
it
doesn't
have
a
body
so
it's
borrowing
ours
iit
borrowed
dawn
and
anya
or
or
it's
manifesting
copies
of
them
like
like
it
did
when
buffy
came
at
us
it's
using
them
to
do
stuff
to
scare
us
attack
us
so
we
need
to
uncreate
it
right
we
need
to
send
it
the
rest
of
the
way
out
of
our
world
uhhuh
except
that
it's
linked
to
the
spell
so
if
we
sent
it
away
it
would
be
like
the
spell
doesn't
exist
like
it
never
happened
like
it
never
brought
buffy
back
yes
you
can't
do
that
you
can't
think
for
a
second
that
you're
going
to
do
that
dawn
if
you
think
you
can
give
her
back
to
me
and
then
take
her
away
again
no
that's
worse
than
if
you'd
never
brought
her
back
you
can't
mess
with
people's
lives
this
way
dawn
we're
not
going
to
do
it
that
way
how
can
you
let
her
do
this
how
can
you
even
talk
about
letting
her
go
honey
you're
not
listening
she
said
we
will
find
another
way
we
will
then
do
it
wait
wait
dawn
everybody
hold
on
what
why
are
you
smiling
that's
inappropriate
because
it's
temporary
what
is
the
demon
iit's
gonna
dissipate
the
only
way
for
it
to
survive
on
this
plane
is
if
it
were
to
kill
the
subject
of
the
original
spell
it
would
live
if
it
killed
buffy
that's
not
gonna
thanks
for
the
tip
you
don't
belong
here
did
they
tell
you
you
belonged
here
did
they
say
this
was
your
home
again
were
you
offered
pretty
lies
little
girl
or
did
they
even
give
you
a
choice
xander
drive
faster
i
can't
i
could
drive
faster
and
i
can't
drive
she's
right
you're
like
a
snail
a
snail
who's
driving
a
car
very
slowly
come
on
give
it
the
lead
foot
we've
got
to
help
buffy
with
that
demon
you
sent
after
her
i
did
not
send
the
demon
i
was
possessed
the
demon
used
me
to
eavesdrop
on
our
conversation
great
so
now
what
we
have
to
talk
in
some
sort
of
antidemon
secret
code
oodgay
ideayay
anyay
stop
talking
wrong
in
pig
latin
and
drive
buffy's
in
trouble
it's
okay
dawnie
willow
and
tara
are
doing
a
spell
you
sure
it
won't
send
buffy
back
no
of
course
not
it's
just
that
she
can't
fight
this
thing
if
it's
all
misty
so
they
make
it
more
solid
so
buffy
can
kick
its
fully
embodied
ass
you
sure
it'll
work
child
of
words
hear
thy
makers
child
of
words
we
entreat
with
our
actions
did
we
make
thee
to
our
voices
wilt
thou
bend
with
our
potions
thou
took
motive
with
our
motions
came
to
pass
we
rescind
no
past
devotions
give
thee
substance
give
thee
mass
you're
the
one
who's
barely
here
set
on
this
earth
like
a
bubble
you
won't
even
disturb
the
air
when
you
go
go
take
dawn
out
of
here
child
of
words
hear
thy
makers
child
of
words
we
entreat
solid
that's
probably
the
sort
of
thing
i'm
not
supposed
to
see
right
dawn
what's
wrong
lunch
you
made
me
lunch
wow
thanks

it
in
summer

start
charging
money
for
every
person
that
asks
me
that
everyone's

little
bit
it's
because
they
care
about
you
a
lot
when
you
were
gone
it
was
bad
when
you
were
gone
but
it'll
be
better

all
they
want
