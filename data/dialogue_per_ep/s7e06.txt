you're
gonna
live
in
that
small
room
over
there
i
know
it
looks
like
a
closet
but
it's
a
room
now
you're
not
gonna
touch
my
food
i
take
the
first
shower
in
the
morning
and
if
i
use
up
all
the
hot
water
that's
your
tough
noogies
and
i
hate
this
plan
are
you
keeping
up
or
do
you
need
some
kind
of
englishtoconstantpaininmyass
translation
invitation
is
there
something
more
emphatic
than
hate
can
i
revile
the
plan
fine
i
invite
you
in
nimrod
don't
want
your
soddin'
food
anyway
i
just
don't
understand
when
his
problems
became
your
problems—more
specifically
mine
the
school
basement
is
making
him
crazy
we
can't
just
leave
him
there
why
not
crazybasementguy
is
better
than
stalkingbuffyguy
it's
true
you
guys
aren't
you're
not
starting
up
again
with
the
whole—
no
a
thousand
gallons
of
no
ok
it's
just—things
are
different
now—he
has
a
soul
i'm
sure
that'll
be
a
real
comfort
when
he
soulfully
attacks
you
again
yeah
what
does
that
mean
exactly—that
spike
is
all
soulhaving
i
don't
know
but
he's
been
through
a
lot
ok
and
nobody's
attacking—
buffy—
sorry
no
it's
me
ii
just—
i'll
go
this
can't
work
it
will
iit
already
is
ok
you
know
you've
been
out
of
the
basement
for
half
an
hour
and
you've
already
stopped
talking
to
invisible
people
bollocks
ok
so
there
was
that
one
episode
in
the
car
but—
no
bollocks
to
the
whole
thing
i
don't
need
your
mollycoddling
it's
not
coddling
now
go
to
your
closet
so
what
is
it
what's
what
last
night
you
said
you
weren't
helping
spike
out
of
pity
what
is
it
it's
a
good
question
is
sitting
there
drinking
soda
some
kind
of
a
zen
nonanswer
no
i
just
i
don't
know
what
i'm
feeling
i
think
i
can't
stand
him
but
sometimes
you
love
him
no
i—i
feel
for
him
feel
what
exactly
dawn
no
i'm—i'm
just
trying
to
understand
i
mean
none
of
it
makes
sense
first
you
say
spike
disgusts
you
but
secretly
you
two
are
doing
it
like
bunnies
and
then
spike
says
he'd
die
for
you
but
he
tries
to
rape
you
for
the
record
spike
knew
how
wrong
it
was
that's
why
he
went
away
but
to
get
a
soul
like
that
would
make
him
a
better
man
xander
had
a
soul
when
he
stood
anya
up
at
the
altar
and
now
he
says
he
still
wants
her
i
just
don't
think
it's
the
school
basement
that's
making
people
crazy
i
should
really
get
back
you
comin'
with
i
just
don't
see
why
people
bother
i
mean
you
put
all
this
energy
into
chasing
and
having
and
brooding
and—
i
just
don't
understand
these
relationships
where
you
all
do
insane
things
bye
rant
girl
well
you
could
like
paint
a
beautiful
mural
on
every
ugly
wall
in
the
world
and
then
you
could
paint
a
beautiful
mural
on
every
ugly
mural
in
the
wor—
maybe
i'm
not
even
the
right
anyanka
ever
think
about
that

tons
of
anyanka's

d'hoffryneffer

heard
screaming
so
i
guess
d'hoffryn
decided
to
take
you
out
after
all

uh
not
head
of
vengeance
for
nothing

rj
not
really
i
do
know
him
i
know
his
soul
really
dawn
he
wasn't
even
on
your
radar
yesterday
it's
the
jacket
it's
true
something
about
the
big
letter
on
the
chest
makes
girls
get
all
swoony
and
crushy
i
saw
it
all
the
time
in
school
and
you
couldn't
just
pin
any
old
felt
letter
to
your
coat
and
get
play—
not
that
i
tried
it
isn't
a
crush
it's
love
i
love
rj
again
since
yesterday
dawn
it's
awfully
fast
what
you're
telling
me
i
don't
feel
what
i
feel
no
of
course
not
i
believe
that
you
think
it's
real
it
seems
real
to
you
you
know
what
maybe
i
don't
want
advice
from
the
dysfunction
queen
you
have
no
idea
how
i
feel
you
have
no
idea
what
real
love
is
maybe
if
you
did
you
wouldn't
make
fun
of
me
this
way
dawn
i'm
not
making
fun
of
you
just
go
leave
me
alone
i
talked
with
the
coach
yeah
i
told
you
man—all
those
fumbles
in
practice—he
was
gonna
come
down
on
you
i'm
starting
on
saturday
great
who
knew
fumbling
all
the
time
was
the
key
it's
just
time
to
let
someone
else
have
a
turn
man
and
you
knew
this
was
coming
yeah
sure
you
can't
do
this
to
rj
oh
hey
it's
you
nice
cheering
the
other
day
it
isn't
fair
he
works
so
hard
what
do
you
care
i
mean
this
is
how
the
game
is
played
it's
dog
eat
dog
may
the
best
man
win
but
nobody's
better
than
rj
yeah
well
that's
not
really
up
to
you
is
it
hmm
it
all
happened
so
fast
i
mean
one
minute
he
was
walking
and
the
next
he
stumbled
and
then
he
fell
why
would
he
say
you
pushed
him
down
the
stairs
i
don't
know
maybe
he
was
just
embarrassed
it's
hard
being
clumsy
especially
when
you're
popular
and
athletic
i'd
bet
yeah
well
to
be
candid
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
i
caught
o'donnell
in
a
lie
it'd
be
nice
if
his
lies
didn't
involve
my
sister
though
anyway
i'm
gonna
have
to
call
coach
wheeler
and
uh
tell
him
the
bad
news
not
a
conversation
i
really
want
to
have
at
least
you
still
got
rj
to
take
over
yeah
well
i
think
we
have
everything
we
need
for
now
i'm
sorry
you
had
to
get
involved
in
this
dawn
that's
ok
i'm
just
really
sorry
it
happened
summers
hey
hi
i
heard
wood
hauled
you
into
his
office
well
yeah
about
o'donnell
yes
that
sucks
facing
the
whole
inquisition
thing
yeah
no
one
expects
the
spanish
inquisition
god
it's
like
i
have
a
disease
or
something
it
was
really
no
big
deal
no
it
was
i
think
it's
cool
that
you
faced
him
wood
we
just
talked
he
just
wanted
me
to
tell
him
about
the
accident
yeah
it
sucks
when
these
things
just
happen—out
of
nowhere
right
out
of
nowhere
you
know
i
was
thinking
of
heading
out
tonight
after
practice
you
want
to
meet
up
uh
hmm
well
spike
definitely
seems
a
little
more
cogent
less
blblblblbl
i'm
just
saying
once
you
get
back
the
soul
doesn't
that
mean
you
start
like
picking
up
your
own
wet
towels
off
the
floor
no
but
maybe
you
start
to
feel
really
bad
about
leaving
them
there
at
least
he's
showering
and
that's
a
refreshing
and
delightful
change
buff
i
think
that's
the
guy
what
guy
the
one
who
according
to
dawn
is
the
quote
smartest
funniest
coolest
hottest
and
having
the
thickest
boy
eyelashes
boy
in
school
unquote
he
don't
seem
so
tough
check
out
the
fan
club
daddy
like
what
is
that
shirt
made
of
paint
buff—
glad
dawnie
isn't
here

see
her
precious
boyfriend

all
thrusty
with
some
slutbag
hussy—

of

way

back

the
time
now
i
gotta
deal
with
you
too
actually
i'm
a
bit
more
formidable
than
mr
wood
you
might
come
to
look
fondly
on
his
backriding
yeah
but
come
on—
sit
hey
i
told
him
i
was
sorry
about
the
homework
mmm
not
the
homework
mr
wizard
the
girls
what
you're
doing
to
them
in
specific
my
sister
hey
i
didn't
do
anything
to
your
sister
and
you
saw
how
hot
she
looked
last
night
i
think
that
proved
that
she—
aah
no
more
with
the
talky
look
i
know
how
guys
like
you
work
you
turn
on
the
charm
you
get
whatever
you
want
no
matter
who
gets
in
your
way
right
ok
look
it's
not
like
that
i
just—
get
along
really
well
with
girls
oh
i
see
how
you
get
along
oh
look
at
me
i'm
mr
quarterback
i
crush
little
girls
and
all
their
little
feelings
all
i
have
to
do
is—
lead
a
team
of
high
school
athletes
trying
their
best
to
do
a
good
job
everyone
depending
on
me
that
is
a
lot
of
pressure
but
it
doesn't
mean
you
get
to
disregard
other
people's
feelings
it's
not
like
i
meant
to
hurt
anyone
i
know
i
know
that
it's
just—
you're
a
leader
a
captain
ok
people
look
up
to
you
you
need
to
keep
that
in
mind
when
you—
i
bet
you
run
a
lot
huh
i
mean
they
work
you
pretty
hard
don't
they
yeah
i
guess
so
i
get
that
i
do
i'm
there
or
at
least
i
was
there
when
i
was
still
in
high
school
which
i
was
just
a
couple
of
years
ago
really
you
know
i
just
realized
that
i'm
basically
the
same
age
as
you
i'm
not
really
older
at
all
actually
just
like
you
but
with
the
sexual
experience
and
stuff
i
think
i
hear
what
you're
saying
um
right

tiniest
thing

strong
oh

me
what
that
adds
up
to
i'm
not
coming
on
too
strong
if
i
just
look
at
him
i've
always
been
fascinated
by
football
so
what's
it
like
to
lead
a
team
the
thing
of
it
is
the
time
nobody
gets
how
much
time
goes
into
it
with
practices
and
games
i
totally
get
it
i
was
kinda
juggling
some
stuff
when
i
was
in
high
school
too—which
was
also
very
recent
principal
snyder
was
always
on
me
i
still
say
wood's
the
worst
you
haven't
seen
the
way
that
guy
rides
me
i
wish
somebody'd
get
him
off
my
back
yeah
that
would
be
cool
and
sometimes
i
didn't
even
do
anything
wrong—
you're
like
a
teacher
not
really
but
i
mean
does
it
bother
you
not
so
much
dawn
what's
wrong
is
this—
did
that
guy
in
the
jacket—
uh
i
don't
even
want
to
hear
his
name
anymore
i
just
called
him
that
guy
in
the
jacket
that's
what
i
used
to
call
him
in
my
head
before
i
knew
his
real
name
dawnie
honey

seem
extremely
perturbed
maybe
i
should
go
get
buffy—

i
don't
ever
want
to
see
her

i
thought
that
was
about
that
guy
in
the—
um
that
guy
with
the
thing
no

about
both
of
them
buffy

a
spell

with
this
boy
he's
not
a
boy
what
do
you

about
our
love
it's
true
and
real
this
isn't
magic
this
is
my
heart
fine
we'll
be
working
look
i
know
this
feels
terrible
but
it
isn't
real
try
to
hold
onto
that
did
you
hear
that
it
isn't
real
you're
just
crazy
it
is
so
real
i
love
him
you
knew
how
i
felt—like
i
finally
found
something
and
you
betrayed
me
i
betrayed
you
you're
the
one
that
constructed
this
elaborate
fantasy
about
you
and
my
lover
your
lover
you're
lover
guys—
guys—
i
tried
to
get
you
to
back
away
that's
right
you
lied
to
me
did
you
want
me
to
tell
you
that
he's
in
love
with
me
that
your
little
crush
is
hopeless
it's
not
a
crush
stop
you're
not
supposed
to
do
this
why
because
he's
younger
than
me
you
know
i'm
extremely
youthful
and
peppy
no
because
you
were
the
one
i
trusted
dawn
wait
crazy
little
lust
puppies
aren't
they
well
at
least
the
yelling
went
away
it
was
starting
to
sound
like
christmas
morning
with
my
family
love
spells
people
forget
how
dangerous
they
can
be
hey
been
there
good
times
here
something
she's
locked
her
door
that
spell
has
her
good
and
loopy
info
on
one
rj
brooks
oh
lemme
see
is
there
a
picture
family
stuff
hey
i
knew
his
brother
he
was
a
big
jock
at
sunnydale
high
too
couple
years
ahead
of
us
he
used
to
stick
chewing
gum
in
my
hair
huh
what're
you
thinking
well
i
think
my
relationship
with
rj's
brother
was
complex
at
best
butmaybe
he's
a
way
in
now
look
for
a
picture
i'm
just
saying
we're—we're
tangling
with
a
powerful
spell
here
we
don't
know
what
the
deal
is
so—so
keep
an
eye
out
if
this
guy
looks
twitchy
and
don't
let
this
guy
charm
you
either
he
had
everyone
around
him
practically
kissing
his
ring
back
in
high
school
yeah
construction
huh
that's
awesome
yeah
so
what's
up
with
rj
how's
he
doing
at
the
old
alpha
mater
good
it's
just—
i
know
a
girl
that
might
be
going
out
with
him
and
i
was
wondering—
god
and
you
want
to
know
if
he's
a
good
guy
truth
is
he's
the
best
following
in
my
footsteps
you
might
not
know
it
now
looking
at
me
with
a
couple
of
extra
pounds
but
back
then
i
was
quite
the
guy
yeah
i
gather
that
rj
is
pretty
popular
too
i
gotta
tell
ya
there
was
a
time
i
was
worried
about
rj
he
was
into
comic
books
model
un
geek
stuff—no
offense
harris
one
time
i
found
all
this
poetry
under
his
bed
turns
out
he
wrote
it
then
he
uh—what
do
you
call
it
blossomed
that's
what
it
was
like
and
do
you
have
any
idea
why
he
you
know
burst
into
a
flower
all
of
a
sudd—
you're
wearing
your
brother's
jacket
here
in
this
picture
oh
no
dude
he's
wearing
mine
that
jacket
was
with
me
all
the
way
through
high
school
gave
it
to
him
when
i
graduated
right
before
i
started
over
at
the
pizza
barn
i'm
in
the
management
program
so
lance
where
did
you
get
the
jacket
oh
dad
gave
it
to
me
made
a
big
deal
about
it
too
how
he
met
mom
wearing
that
jacket
she
was
a
former
miss
arkansas
very
hot
in
her
day
wow
that's
wonderful
boy
it's
getting
late
hey
you
guys
don't
have
to
take
off
if
you
don't
want
too
i
got
sort
of
a
rumpus
room
set
up
in
the
basement
there's
air
hockey
and
a
mini
fridge
we
could
party
lance
do
you
have
guests
down
there
there's
little
boxes
or
raisins
if
you
want
snacks
we
really
gotta
go
damn
love
spell
i
have
tried
every
antilove
spell
spell
i
could
find
even
if
you
find
the
right
one
the
guy
would
probably
just
do
an
antiantilove
spell
spell
spell
what
i'll
get
it
maybe
it's
xander
with
some
answers
from
the
brother

was
looking
for
buffy

ass—
aj

my
best
friend
and
my
dearest
darling—
