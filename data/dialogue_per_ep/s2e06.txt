i'm
supposed

be
meeting
devon
but
he's
nowhere

it's
like
he
thinks
being
in
a
band
gives
him
an
obligation
to
flake
well
his
loss
is
your
incredible
gain
so
i
told
devon

leather
interior

barbie
dream
car
had
nicer
seats'
i
have
no
skin
left

i
but

i
kidding
i'm
an
angel
burning
out
oh
now
dates
are
things
normal
girls
have
girls
who
have
time
to
think
about
nail
polish
and
facials
you
know
what
i
think
about
ambush
tactics
beheading
not
exactly
the
stuff
dreams
are
made
of
cappuccino
hey
you're
volunteering
but
i
have
to
get
to
class
snyder
must
be
in
charge
of
the
volunteer
safety
program
for
halloween
this
year
note
his
interesting
take
on
the
volunteer
concept
what's
the
deal
oh
a
bunch
of
little
kids
need
people
to
take
them
trickor
treating
sign
up
and
get
your
own
pack
of
sugarhyped
little
runts
for
the
night
yikes
i'll
stick
to
vampires
miss
summers
just
the
juvenile
delinquent
i've
been
looking
for
principal
snyder
halloween
must
be
a
big
night
for
you
tossing
eggs
keying
cars
bobbing
for
apples
one
pathetic
cry
for
help
after
another
well
not
this
year
missy
gosh
i'd
love
to
sign
up
but
i
recently
developed
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
and
can
tragically
no
longer
hold
a
flashlight
the
program
starts
at
four
the
children
have
to
be
back
at
six
i
can't
believe
this
we
have
to
get
dressed
up
and
the
whole
deal
snyder
said
costumes
were
mandatory
great
i
was
gonna
stay
in
and
veg
the
one
night
a
year
things
are
supposed
to
be
quiet
for
me
halloween
quiet
oh
i
figured
it'd
be
a
big
old
vamp
scare
apalooza
not
according
to
giles
he
swears
that
tomorrow
night
is
like
dead
for
the
undead
they
stay
in
those
wacky
vampires
that's
why
i
love
'em
they
just
keep
you
guessing
harris
hey
lar
you're
lookin'
cromag
as
usual
what
can
i
do
you
for
you
and
buffy
you're
just
friends
right
i
like
to
think
of
it
less
as
a
friendship
and
more
as
a
solid
foundation
for
future
bliss
so
she
she's
not
your
girlfriend
alas
no
do
you
think
she'd
go
out
with
me
well
lar
that's
a
tough
question
to
no
not
a
chance
why
not
i
heard
some
guys
say
she
was
fast
i
hope
you
mean
like
the
wind
yeah
you
know
what
i
mean
that's
my
friend
that
you're
talkin'
about
oh
yeah
well
what're
you
gonna
do
about
it
i'm
gonna
do
what
any
man
would
do
about
it
somethin'
damn
manly
get
gone
ooo
diet
do
you
know
what
you
just
did
saved
you
a
dollar
no
but
larry
was
about
to
pummel
me
oh
that
forget
about
it
oh
i'll
forget
about
it
in
maybe
fifteen
twenty
years
when
my
rep
for
being
a
sissy
man
finally
fades
xander
don't
you
think
you're
a
black
eye
heals
buffy
but
cowardice
has
an
unlimited
shelf
life
oh
thanks
thanks
a
lot
for
your
help
i
think
i
just
violated
the
guy
code
big
time
poor
xander
boys
are
so
fragile
speaking
of
how
was
your
date
last
night
misfire
i
was
late
due
to
unscheduled
slayage
showed
up
looking
trashed
was
he
mad
actually
he
was
pretty
unmad
which
probably
had
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
cordelia
was
drooling
in
his
cappuccino
oh
buffy
angel
would
never
fall
for
her
act
you
mean
that
'actually
showing
up
wearing
a
stunning
outfit
embracing
personal
hygiene'
act
you
know
what
i
mean
uh
she's
not
his
type
are
you
sure
i
mean
i
don't
know
what
his
type
is
i've
known
him
less
than
a
year
and
if
you
haven't
noticed
he's
not
exactly
one
to
over
share
true
it's
too
bad
we
can't
sneak
a
look
at
the
watcher
diaries
and
read
up
on
angel
i'm
sure
it's
full
of
fun
facts
to
know
and
tell
yeah
it's
too
bad
that
stuff
is
private
also
giles
keeps
them
in
his
office
in
his
personal
files
most
importantly
it
would
be
wrong
buffy
excellent
nothing
hi
yes
ii
just
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
tomorrow
night
as
it
should
be
uh
calm
you
might
work
on
some
new
battle
techniques
you're
beginning
to
scare
me
giles
you
need
to
have
some
fun
you
know
there's
this
place
you
can
go
right
and
you
sit
in
the
dark
and
there
are
these
moving
pictures
right
and
the
pictures
tell
a
story
yes
yes
ha
ha
very
droll
i'll
have
you
know
that
i
have
very
uh
many
relaxing
hobbies
such
as
well
um
i
enjoy
crossreferencing
do
you
stuff
your
own
shirts
or
do
you
send
them
out
so
how
come
halloween
is
such
a
big
yawner
i
mean
do
the
demons
just
hate
how
commercial
it's
become
um
it's
interesting
ac
not
i
suspect
to
you
what
is
it
you're
after
of
course
it's
of
interest
to
me
i'm
the
slayer
i
need
to
know
these
things
you
can't
keep
me
in
the
dark
any
longer
look
at
me
when
i
talk
to
you
i
really
don't
have
time
for
these
games
ms
calendar
said
you
were
a
babe
she
said
what
well
she
said
that
you
were
a
hhunk
of
burning
something
or
other
so
whadaya
think
of
that
uh
i
i
don't
um
uh
a
burning
hunk
of
what
look
you
know
how
disgusting
it
is
for
me
to
even
contemplate
you
grownups
having
smoochies
but
i
think
you
should
go
for
it
buffy
i
appreciate
your
interest
but
but
i've
overstepped
my
bounds
it's
none
of
my
business
you
know
what
was
i
thinking
my
god
shame
shame
i
gotta
go
a
babe
i
can
live
with
that
man
look
at
her
who
is
she
it
doesn't
say
but
the
entry's
dated
1775
angel
was
eighteen
and
still
human
so
that's
the
kinda
girl
he
hung
around
she's
pretty
coiffed
she
looks
like
a
noble
woman
or
something
which
means
being
beautiful
is
sort
of
her
job
and
clearly
this
girl
was
a
workaholic
i'll
never
be
like
this
c'mon
she's
not
that
pretty
i
mean
look
at
her
she's
got
a
funny
uh
waist
look
how
tiny
that
is
thank
you
now
i
feel
better
no
she's
like
a
freak
a
circus
freak
yuk
musta
been
wonderful
put
on
some
fantabulous
gown
and
go
to
a
ball
like
a
princess
and
have
horses
and
servants
and
yet
more
gowns
yeah
still
i
think
i
prefer
being
able
to
vote
or
i
will
when
i
can
so
buffy
you
ran
off
last
night
and
left
poor
little
angel
all
by
his
lonesome
but
i
did
everything
i
could
to
comfort
him
i'll
bet
so
what's
his
story
anyway
i
mean
i
never
see
him
around
not
during
the
day
anyway
oh
please
don't
tell
me
he
still
lives
at
home
like
he
has
to
wait
for
his
dad
to
get
back
before
he
can
take
the
car
cordelia
i
think
his
parents
have
been
dead
for
a
couple
of
hundred
years
oh
good
i
mean
angel's
a
vampire
i
thought
you
knew
oh
he's
a
vampire
of
course
but
the
cuddly
kind
like
a
carebear
with
fangs
it's
true
you
know
what
i
think
i
just
think
you're
trying
to
scare
me
off
'cause
you're
afraid
of
the
competition
look
buffy
you
may
be
hot
stuff
when
it
comes
to
demonology
or
whatever
but
when
it
comes
to
dating

the
slayer
what'd
you
get
a
timehonored
classic
okay

can
i
give
you
a
little
friendly

halloween
stunt
stinks
of
ethan
rayne
yes
it
does
doesn't
it
don't
wish
to
blow
my
own
trumpet
but
it's
genius
the
very
embodiment
of
'be
careful
what
you
wish
for'
it's
sick
brutal
and
it
harms
the
innocent
oh
and
we
all
know
that
you
are
the
champion
of
innocents
and
all
things
pure
and
good
rupert
it's
quite
a
little
act
you've
got
going
here
old
man
it's
no
act
it's
who
i
am
who
you
are
the
watcher
sniveling
tweedclad
guardian
of
the
slayer
and
her
kin
i
think
not
i
know
who
you
are
rupert
and
i
know
what
you're
capable
of
but
they
don't
do
they
they
have
no
idea
where
you
come
from
break
the
spell
ethan
then
leave
this
place
and
never
come
back
why
should
i
what's
in
the
bargain
for
me
you
get
to
live
oh
rupert
you're
scaring
me
over
here

if
there
are
any
other
ways
