use
my
help

be
splinter
issues

a
true

watch
out
for
southpaws
buff
don't

in
schematics
for
the
crypt
part
of
the
original
plan
for
the
cemetery
sometime
there's
a
oh
no
back
way
in
just
the
one
entrance
well
maybe
we
could
make
it
work
for
us
we
could
stake
out
the
entrance
you
know
uh
maybe
use
a
decoy
lure
them
out
or
i
bet
there
we
can
get
in
that
way
oh
of
course
why
didn't
i
think
of
that
i'm
sure
you
would
have

have
a
plan
buffy

the
wrong
town

that
one
you
got
two
of
them

feel
pretty
good
but
i
let
one
get
by
me
don't
worry
you
know
it
only
matters
that
you
do
your
best
but

just
it
i
don't
think
it
was
my
best
hey
jonathan
over
here
quick
photo
please
another
one
right
here
ok
guys
that's
enough
i
think
we
did
great
we
knocked
em
dead
which
they
already
were
we
knocked
'em
deader
they
weren't
very
well
organized
if
they
had
all
rushed
at
buffy
they
could
have
killed
her
right
away
thanks
anya
that
won't
keep
me
awake
all
night
vampires
only
form
nests
to
make
hunting
easier
they're
not
big
on
the
cooperation
they
mostly
like
to
hang
out
all
creepy
and
alone
in
the
shadows
don't
you
agree
spike
well
well
the
man
himself
what
are
you
doing
here
i
live
here
i
wasn't
exactly
pining
for
a
noisy
visit
from
'wonder
jonathan
and
his
fluffy
battle
kittens'
yeah
you
think
that
one
up
with
all
the
time
you
spend
not
being
able
to
bite
people
careful
he's
still
pretty
dangerous
yeah
back
off
'betty'
buffy
it's
buffy
you
big
bleached
stupid
guy
spike
you're
the
worst
type
of
scum
the
second
you're
back
to
your
old
tricks
well
let's
just
say
before
you
even
sniff
out
your
first
victim
you'll
be
pretty
indistinguishable
from
oh
what
should
we
say
instant
soup
mix
next
thing
i
know
this
crazed
vamp
is
like
running
right
at
me
and
i
know
if
it
gets
past
me
there's
no
telling
who's
in
danger
next
come
on
you
have
fun
admit
it
living
the
scooby
life
i
was
going
for
a
kind
of
stoic
bravery
but
yeah
and
it
was
exciting
with
the
ceiling
coming
in
and
everything
oh
that's
a
cute
one
aand
buffy
she
was
ok
oh
she
was
great
twang
poof
that
was
the
sound
the
crossbow
vampire
dusting
i
mean
she
was
a
little
cranky
that
she
missed
that
one
vamp
wwell
ii
kind
of
meant
personally
that
whole
thing
with
faith
it
pretty
much
freaked
me
out
and
i
was
just
sensing
it
from
a
distance
oh
yeah
i
know
she's
not
over
the
whole
riley
sleeping
with
faith
thing
oh
you
know
i
mean
faith's
insides
and
buffy's
outsides
when
her
insides
were
out
i
hope
they'll
be
ok
i
sure
it'll
blow
over
they're
probably
all
with
the
smoochies
right
now
you
must
be
feeling
better
yeah
yeah
i'm
a
lot
stronger
i'm
no
jonathan
but
i'm
doing
ok
are
you
i
mean
you're
not
what
eating
the
initiatives'
technicolor
food
of
strongness
no
uh
uh
they
uh
they
swear
they've
stopping
treating
the
food
but
i'm
not
taking
the
chance
you
know
i
uh
i
don't
know
if
that
means
i'll
get
weaker
or
dumber
or
smarter
they're
not
big
with
the
disclosure
huh
they
still
haven't
released
a
full
profile
on
adam
and
we're
having
zero
luck
tracking
him
i
just
if
they'd
just
put
a
little
trust
in
me
i
know
i
could
get
the
job
done
i've
felt
that
way
my
entire
life
you'd
think
i
could
do
that
guess
it
takes
different
muscles
than
demon
beheading
you
just
need
a
few
pointers
now
if
slaying
was
a
competitive
sport
then
i'd
have
a
chance
you
know
we
could
have
figure
staking
and
speed
staking
i
ahhh
sorry
i
this
just
isn't
my
game
i
gotta
it's
all
faith's
fault
she's
like
poison
no
worse
she's
like
acid
that
eats
through
everything
maybe
she's
a
bomb
the
point
is
everything
was
going
along
great
with
riley
and
then
she
comes
along
and
messes
everything
up
buffy
you
know
what
i
think
i
don't
think
this
about
you
being
angry
with
faith
i
think
you're
angry
with
riley
hi
could
you
please
sure
i
mean
you
have
this
amazing
connection
with
him
thank
you
and
then
at
the
one
moment
when
it
matters
the
most
he
looks
into
your
eyes
and
he
doesn't
even
see
that
it's
not
you
looking
back
at
him
there's
no
way
he
could
know
i
mean
you
don't
just
look
at
someone
and
say
'hey
that's
not
your
body
get
out
of
that
body
with
your
hands
up'
i
know
you
know
that
but
you
have
to
believe
it
buffy
if
there's
any
part
of
you
that's
blaming
riley
for
what
happened
it
seems
like
there's
a
part
of
you
that
needs
to
forgive
him
you're
jonathan
levinson
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
my
name
is
karen
and
i
think
you're
you're
wonderful
oh
my
god
hi
karen
thank
you
oh
is
that
my
book
well
i
could
uh
yeah
please
ii
didn't
want
to
bother
you
it's
karen
with
a
k
thank
you
so
much
thanks
so
what
do
think
buffy
i
mean
if
i'm
wrong
smack
me
karen
with
a
k
will
lend
you
a
book
and
it's
pretty
heavy
heh
maybe
i
have
been
blaming
him
but
how
do
i
get
past
it
hmmph
what
if
it's
too
late
what
if
after
all
this
he
doesn't
want
me
anymore
he
does
it's
not
going
to
be
easy
buffy
but
you
guys
are
very
special
together
that's
worth
a
little
hard
work
but
i'm
not
even
sure
if
i
know
how
to
talk
to
him
anymore
how
do
i
make
it
ok
again
if
you
really
want
it
you
can
make
anything
happen
for
those
of
you
who
don't
already
know
my
name
is
colonel
george
haviland
i'm
commanding
officer
here
until
such
time
as
the
facility
review
is
completed
this
review
does
not
mean
our
primary
mission
is
changed
in
any
way
recovery
of
the
hostile
known
as
adam
is
our
first
and
most
important
job
to
this
end
i've
asked
our
tactical
consultant
here
to
address
us
today
mr
levinson
thank
you
colonel
it's
about
time
we
brought
out
the
big
guns
men
before
we
can
locate
adam
we
need
to
understand
him
better
and
there's
something
that's
bothered
me
almost
from
the
start
he
doesn't
eat
we've
known
him
to
kill
but
never
to
eat
the
kill
so
i've
pulled
some
of
professor
walsh's
original
design
schematics
and
i've
found
something
his
power
source
is
not
biological
at
all
it's
here
the
design
attempts
to
hide
it
but
i
believe
that
there's
a
small
reservoir
of
uranium
235
sir
how
long
will
it
last
essentially
forever
it
also
means
that
cutting
off
his
head
is
useless
killing
adam
means
annihilating
him
completely
but
first
we
have
to
find
him
where
are
you
jonathan
are
you
like
never
home
she's
ready
to
forget
it
you
better
be
ready
too
i
don't
know
jonathan
i
mean
i
don't
know
if
she'll
really
ever
forget
it
every
time
i
try
to
touch
her
she's
scared
scared
of
me
scared
of
what
you're
thinking
about
what
do
you
mean
she
knows
that
faith
is
experienced
what
are
you
saying
experienced
god
does
she
think
that
what
that
i'd
be
comparing
she
knows
she's
the
one
i
care
about
have
you
let
her
know
that
i
think
i
haven't
i
she
has
to
know
jonathan
people
can't
always
see
what's
right
in
front
of
them
witch
doctor
stirred
it
up
for
me
i
took
sips
from
your
sweet
lips
and
now
i
can't
get
free
trapped
in
a
web
of
love
trapped
in
a
web
of
love
did
not
last
night
with
me
you
said
jonathan
it
was
a
moan
fine
you
moaned
jonathan
not
unh
it
was
like
unnhunnhatha
maybe
it
was
ahhonathan
still
not
fluffing
up
the
old
ego
quite
the
couple
aren't
they
they
get
into
a
fistfight
i've
got
a
fifty
on
anya
wonder
if
they'll
make
it
good
evening
everyone
i'd
to
dedicate
this
to
some
friends
of
mine
a
very
special
couple
who've
been
going
through
a
tough
time
when
i
hear
that
serenade
in
blue
i'm
somewhere
in
another
world
alone
with
you
sharing
all
the
joys
we
used
to
know
many
moons
ago
once
again
your
face
comes
back
to
me
just
like
the
theme
of
some
forgotten
melody
in
the
album
of
my
memory
serenade
in
blue
seems
like
only
yesterday
a
small
caf√©
a
crowded
floor
and
as
we
danced
the
night
away
i
hear
you
say
forever
more
and
then
the
song
became
a
sigh
forever
more
became
goodbye
but
you
remain
in
my
heart
tell
me
darling
is
there
still
a
spot
buffy
i
want
you
to
know
do
we
have
to
have
the
talk
no
talk
more
dance
i
just
want
to
say
i'm
sorry
that
it's
only
you
that
i
want
i
know
i
know
all
of
that
you
do
since
when
since
you
put
your
arms
around
me
oh
my
god
he's
going
to
do
something
off
the
new
album
xander
yeah
let's
go
have
sex
now
yeah
ok
oh
what
is
it
are
you
ok
karen
that's
your
name
isn't
it
ii
signed
my
book
for
you
tell
me
what
hurt
you
karen
i
can
help
let's
get
you
warmed
up
what's
going
on
why
are
you
here
mr
levinson
someone
on
your
staff
reported
a
disturbance
when
i
realized
it
was
on
your
property
i
thought
i'd
better
come
down
in
person
that's
all
right
sergeant
i
have
it
under
control
of
course
sir
glad
to
see
you're
alright
karen
i
know
you're
scared
but
i
need
to
hear
your
description
again
it
was
ugly
big
ugly
all
bent
over
sort
of
with
these
huge
arms
and
like
scabs
and
stuff
that
must
have
been
very
frightening
i'm
so
sorry
oh
oh
i
forgot
it
had
a
mark
a
mark
on
it's
forehead
like
a
symbol
well
this
is
a
clue
jonathan
i've
heard
of
this
it's
not
a
demon
just
a
monster
not
much
more
than
an
animal
it
sticks
to
the
woods
doesn't
come
near
populated
areas
but
it
did
this
time
it
might
again
maybe
we
should
patrol
if
you
want
me
to
mobilize
the
squad
actually
i
think
karen
simply
startled
it
probably
more
afraid
of
you
than
you
were
of
it
i'll
patrol
but
you
don't
need
to
worry
about
it
i
can
handle
it
on
my
own
now
let's
see
about
getting
karen
a
ride
home
i
wish
you'd
get
rid
of
that
body
the
smell's
making
me
hungry
you
wouldn't
want
it
it
had
a
blood
disease
it
didn't
know
it
but
it
would
have
been
dead
within
the
year
humans
sense
so
little
of
what
they
carry
inside
oh
alright
well
you're
the
evil
messiah
guy
so
heh
oh
hey
there's
something
new
in
town
yeah
attacked
a
girl
caused
a
little
fuss
oh
he
was
there
pfft
jonathan
jonathan
tell
me
who
is
he
heh
you're
joking
right
jonathan
is
jonathan
look
these
are
lies
none
of
this
is
real
the
world
has
been
changed
it's
intriguing
but
it's
wrong
feels
ok
to
me
you're
under
his
spell
just
like
the
others
i
seem
to
be
the
only
one
who
is
not
really
and
what
makes
you
so
special
i'm
aware
i
know
every
molecule
of
myself
and
everything
around
me
no
one
no
human
no
demon
has
ever
been
as
awake
and
alive
as
i
am
you
are
all
just
shadows
oh
so
what
do
what
do
you
do
now
hey
you
could
kill
jonathan
well
or
you
could
try
the
guy's
like
a
dynamo
of
action
i
don't
need
to
do
anything
these
magicks
are
unstable
corrosive
they
will
inevitably
lead
to
chaos
and
i
am
interested
in
chaos
jonathan
aren't
you
coming
to
bed
yeah
it's
getting
late
be
right
there
i'm
glad
you're
ok
everyone
in
the
bronze
was
pretty
freaked
out
after
you
left
so
i
guess
you
have
go
fight
this
thing
huh
all
the
weapons
are
at
giles'
it
shouldn't
take
too
long
no
go
did
you
just
go
'no
go'
jonathan
did
he
said
it
was
some
brainless
beast
and
that
he
would
take
care
of
it
himself
oh
cool
i
guess
i
don't
know
he
just
he
seemed
a
little
scared
heh
buffy
this
is
jonathan
you
know
he
doesn't
get
scared
you
talked
about
it
when
you
gave
him
the
class
protector
award
at
the
prom
you're
right
ummm
my
exit
willow
ii'll
see
you
tomorrow
ok
so
saw
you
and
riley
with
the
dancing
it
was
a
great
dance
yeah
for
the
first
time
it
felt
like
faith
wasn't
there
like
no
one
was
there
but
us
sensus
confundantur
at
aer
oppleatur
what's
going
on
oh
my
god

gonna
be
ok
but
she's
terrified
what
happened
what
did
this
someone
found
her
in
the
janitor's
closet
about
an
hour
ago
ii
think
she
was
there
all
night
she
was
all
alone
tara
what
did
this
big
lumpy
had
something
on
its
on
its
head
like
a
greek
letter
only
not

was
it
this
buffy
jonathan
said
we
were
all
safe
jonathon
said
it
xander's
not
here
oh
you're
not
going
away
why
aren't
you
going
away
oh
i
was
kind
of
hoping
to
look
at
some
of
xander's
stuff
oh
sure
come
on
in
make
yourself
at
home
and
so
on
oh
you're
still
here
that's
nice
may
i
ask
you
something
does
it
every
seem
just
a
little
strange
that
jonathan
is
so
good
at
everything
he's
jonathan
hey
i
was
just
at
the
part
where
he
invented
the
internet
anya
he
fights
better
than
i
do
and
i'm
the
slayer
the
slayer
that's
supposed
to
mean
something
right
oh
buck
up
you
you
kill
the
best
go
you
kill
kill
actually
not
needing
validation
right
now
but
thank
you
he
just
seems
too
perfect
i
don't
know
so
i
can
have
my
book
back
anya
when
you
were
a
demon
you
granted
wishes
right
vengeance
wishes
on
exboyfriends
i'd
wish
he
was
a
dog
or
ugly
or
in
love
with
president
mckinley
or
something
but
someone
could
wish
the
whole
world
to
be
different
right
that's
possible
sure
alternate
realities
you
could
uh
could
have
like
a
world
without
shrimp
or
with
you
know
nothing
but
shrimp
you
could
even
make
like
a
freaky
world
where
jonathan's
some
kind
of
not
perfect
mouth
breather
if
that's
what's
blowing
up
your
skirt
these
days
just
don't
ask
me
to
live
there
now
if
i
uh
could
just
have
book
back
you
could
be
on
your
way
someplace
else
here
i'm
just
saying
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
hhe
starred
in
the
matrix
but
he
never
left
town
and
how'd
he
graduate
from
med
school
he's
only
eighteen
years
old
effective
time
management
ii'm
sorry
buffy
but
i
just
don't
understand
what
you're
trying
to
say
yeah
and
when
is
jonathan
going
to
get
here
and
start
the
meeting
this
is
the
meeting
this
is
the
meeting
well
i
was
just
kind
of
wondering
if
maybe
anyone
thought
that
jonathan
was
kind
of
too
perfect
no
he's
not
he's
just
perfect
enough
he
crushed
the
bones
of
the
master
he
blew
up
a
big
snake
made
out
of
mayor
and
he
coached
the
us
women's
soccer
team
to
stunning
world
cup
victory
we
saw
him
doing
those
things
but
that's
just
it
i'm
not
entirely
sure
that
we
can
trust
our
memories
anya
tell
them
about
the
alternate
universes
oh
ok
umm
say
you
really
like
shrimp
a
lot
or
we
could
say
you
don't
like
shrimp
at
all
blah
i
wish
there
weren't
any
shrimp
you
would
say
to
yourself
stop
you're
saying
it
wrong
i
think
that
jonathan
may
be
doing
something
so
that
he's
manipulating
the
world
and
we're
all
like
his
pawns
or
prawns
stop
with
the
shrimp
i
am
trying
to
do
something
here
of
course
but
it
may
be
a
little
out
of
your
depth
i'm
not
sounds
like
nonsense
but
i'm
starting
to
know
this
girl
pretty
well
and
i
think
she
sees
things
that
the
rest
of
us
don't
i
think
for
once
we
should
follow
her
lead
ok
i
think
jonathan
might
be
ignoring
evidence
i
think
he
might
have
let
tara
get
hurt
on
purpose
no
no
how
did
he
ignore
evidence
the
monster
had
a
mark
on
it
jonathan
saw
it
aand
he
kind
of
blinked
he
blinked
the
man
moistened
his
eyeballs
and
we're
having
a
meeting
about
it
he
knows
something
about
the
monster
he
was
reacting
to
the
mark
oh
wait
i
remember
something
giles
do
you
have
a
jonathan
swimsuit
calendar
no
yes
it
was
a
gift
no
no
whoa
no
there
oh
yeah
pretty
darn
lickable
the
other
kind
of
oh
that's
it
that's
what
tara
saw
why
would
jonathan
have
the
same
mark
as
the
monster
i
don't
know
but
he's
definitely
keeping
is
this
a
private
conversation
or
can
mr
july
sit
in
jonathan
hi
buffy
was
just
saying
how
you
had
a
monster
cut
up
willow's
friend
and
buffy
no
it's
just
the
mark
you
said
it
was
safe
and
it
wasn't
i'm
sorry
i
just
don't
understand
then
i'll
explain
buffy
is
right
no
i
do
have
a
history
with
the
creature
the
monster
the
problem
is
every
time
i
face
it
my
mind
becomes
sort
of
confused
there's
some
kind
of
power
it
possesses
oh
oh
he's
like
your
kryptonite
maybe
i
just
knows
it
takes
all
my
energy
to
try
and
fight
the
confusion
that's
why
i
had
his
mark
tattooed
on
me
so
that
i
wouldn't
underestimate
it
next
time
this
does
explain
everything
i
knew
you
wouldn't
do
anything
on
purpose
me
too
and
that
whole
alternate
universe
thing
was
too
freaky
jonathan
let's
go
after
the
monster
right
now
you
and
me
i'm
sure
it's
left
town
by
now
that's
been
its
pattern
we
can
try
sure
let's
do
that
bye
jonathan
goodbye
oh
look
jonathan
taking
the
little
sidekick
out
for
a
walk
are
we
shut
up
spike
ooh
ooh
ooh
semi
harsh
language
from
betty
you're
feisty
when
the
big
guy
standing
beside
you
someday
sweet
slayer
i
would
love
to
take
you
on
see
you
face
the
evil
alone
for
once
that's
enough
of
the
creepy
small
talk
we're
looking
for
a
monster
why
would
i
know
about
that
every
demon
in
this
town's
gunning
for
you
right
now
so
i
figure
you're
probably
keeping
pretty
good
track
of
them
big
arms
mark
on
its
head
have
you
seen
it
no
but
then
again
i'm
probably
lying
we're
not
getting
anything
out
of
him
hey
what
are
you
doing
you're
not
supposed
to
do
that
you're
pretty
much
relying
on
butcher's
blood
these
days
right
spike
what
are
you
saying
just
that
the
butchers
in
this
town
respect
jonathan
they
do
him
a
favor
and
you
might
find
yourself
getting
kind
of
thirsty
look
i
don't
know
much
ok
some
vampires
got
kicked
out
of
a
cave
in
the
hills
behind
brookside
park
i
don't
know
what
did
the
kicking
out
but
it's
probably
pretty
big
that
was
very
good
very
good
these
spells
these
really
work
i
mean
can
you
really
'turn
your
enemies
inside
out'
or
learn
to
'excrete
gold
coins'
that
one's
not
so
much
fun
they
work
riley
but
they
take
concentration
being
attuned
with
the
forces
of
the
universe
right
you
can't
just
go
'librum
incendere'
and
expect
xander
don't
speak
latin
in
front
of
the
books
hey
ii
found
the
mark
it's
part
of
an
augmentation
spell
jonathan
did
an
augmentation
spell
what
uh
did
he
have
uh
you
know
him
and
how
we
see
him
this
spell
turns
the
sorcerer
into
a
sort
of
paragon
the
best
of
everything
everyone's
ideal
butbut
there's
a
drawback
a
drawback
that
happens
a
lot
yes
in
order
to
balance
the
new
force
of
good
the
spell
has
to
create
the
opposing
force
of
evil
the
worst
of
everything
everyone's
nightmare
he
created
the
monster
so
we're
saying
he
did
a
spell
just
to
make
us
think
he
was
cool
yes
that
is
so
cool
giles
buffy
and
jonathan
are
going
after
this
nightmare
thing
are
they
going
to
be
ok
it
seems
that
the
wellbeing
of
this
creature
is
linked
to
jonathan
if
it
dies
the
spell
is
broken
and
jonathan
reverts
to
whatever
he
was
before
jonathan
isn't
gonna
want
buffy
to
get
very
far
wow
fall
down
there
and
be
dead
for
a
while
yeah
don't
want
that
to
happen
come
on
we've
got
a
monster
to
buffy
was
right
buffy
was
right
it
doesn't
sound
very
likely
does
it
so
if
this
is
the
world
he
created
what's
the
real
world
like
i'm
scared
everything's
going
to
change
well
actually
it'll
remain
pretty
much
the
same
except
jonathan
won't
be
jonathan
not
our
jonathan
anyway
no
no
no
world
without
sunshine
world
without
joy
but
wait
it
only
changes
back
if
buffy
kills
this
thing
i
mean
if
she
loses
then
we
could
be
stuck
in
this
wrong
world
forever
things
looking
up
i
mean
we're
all
happy
here
right
you
know
if
she
doesn't
get
killed
giles
can
buffy
do
it
ii
honestly
don't
know
she's
never
stood
alone
against
something
like
this
before
jonathan
what
do
i
do
i
think
you're
going
to
have
to
handle
this
one
solo
what
but
i
you'll
know
you
used
to
and
the
more
you
hurt
it
the
more
i'll
lose
my
what
lose
your
i
remember
this
this
good
i
can't
believe
we
believed
it
riley
it
seemed
so
real
well
in
that
world
it
was
real
alternate
realities
are
neat
you
know
what
i'll
always
remember
the
swimsuit
calendar's
sticking
in
my
mind
not
in
a
good
way
i'll
always
remember
the
way
he
made
me
feel
about
me
valued
respected
sort
of
tingly
now
i'm
just
empty
poor
xander
i
guess
jonathan
hurt
you
most
of
all
ummm
except
of
course
after
tara
did
anyone
else
feel
way
too
tall
i
felt
way
too
tall
i
liked
his
clothes
he
had
really
cool
clothes
still
not
understanding
how
he
got
the
house
and
everything
and
who
really
did
star
in
the
matrix
wait
that
wasn't
real
either
hi
i
wasn't
sure
you'd
come
over
everyone's
mostly
forgetting
but
i
think
some
people
are
kind
of
angry
yeah
nobody's
even
talking
to
me
and
the
twins
moved
out
why
did
you
do
it
anyway
no
i
get
why
how
after
the
thing
with
the
bell
tower
and
the
gun
i
went
to
counseling
you
know
other
kids
with
problems
aand
one
of
them
had
this
spell
he
glossed
right
over
the
monster
well
anyway
i
just
ii
just
wanted
to
apologize
nobody
was
supposed
to
get
hurt
jonathan
you
get
why
everyone
is
angry
though
right
it's
not
just
the
monster
people
didn't
like
being
the
little
actors
in
your
sock
puppet
theater
you
weren't
you
weren't
socks
we
were
friends
jonathan
you
can't
keep
trying
to
make
everything
work
out
with
some
big
gesture
all
at
once
things
are
complicated
they
take
time
and
work
yeah
right
hey
hey
buffy
you
remember
i
gave
you
some
advice
watch
out
for
southpaws
uh
no
about
you
and
riley
i
mean
things
are
starting
to
blur
but
this
cool
thing
i
said
um
that
i
don't
really
remember
i
think
it's
right
i
think
it's
kind
of
the
same
thing
you
just
said
to
me
about
things
taking
work
yeah
i
remember
good
because
it's
true
what
you
have
is
really
complicated
but
it's
worth
it
i
think
that's
what
i
said
i'm
glad
we
talked
this
all
out
we
haven't
talked
at
all
oh
well
whatever
we're
doing
we're
doing
it
great
mmmmm
jonathan
