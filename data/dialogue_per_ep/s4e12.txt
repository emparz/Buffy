opens
the
door
and
steps
inside
the
rec
room
which
is
in
total
darkness
a
second
later
the
lights
come
up
and
we

buffy
see
that
it
is
a
surprise
party
for
her
19th
birthday
and
a
crowd
of
people
yelling
surprise
which
buffy
is
and
quickly
hides
her
stake
riley
rushes
in
through
the
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
but
attention
is
on
buffy
so
he
hides
the
crossbow
without
anybody
noticing
it
in
the
crowd
we
see
xander
harris
anya
rupert
giles
and
several
other
faces

you
won't
be
killing
anything
tonight
after
all
don't

lively
space

riley

quite
a
surprise
the
first
of
many
uh
been
dating
long
giles
was
the
librarian
at
my
high
school
ah
i've
seen
the
library

gone
down
hill
since
you
left
yes
iii'm
embarrassed
to
say
that
i
actually
miss
it
at
times
so
you're
retired
i'm
sorry
or
you're
working
somewhere
else
now
well
not
uh
sort
of
between
projects
uh
right
now
uh
it's
a
personal
oh
oh
look
giles
has
no
cake
oh
here
here
i'll
get
you
a
piece
oh
he's
just
nervous
but
this
is
so
nice
having
everyone
together
for
my
birthday
of
course
you
could
smash
in
all
my
toes
with
a
hammer
and
it
will
still
be
the
bestest
buffy
birthday
bash
in
a
big
long
while
right
aaactually
willow
aaand
xander
did
all
the
planning
i'm
not
sure
i
would
have
gone
with
the
surprise
party
you
know
you
have
enough
things
jumping
out
at
you
in
the
dark
professor
walsh
says
that
adrenaline
is
like
exercise
but
without
the
exorbitant
gym
fees
very
witty
you
should
meet
her
she's
absolutely
the
smartest
person
i've
ever
met
perhaps
we
should
have
invited
professor
walsh
to
the
party
oh
no
i
mean
she's
like
forty
she's
got
better
things
to
do
than
hang
out
with
a
bunch
of
kids
here
you
go
sir
you
own
nothing
this
shouldn't
be
taking
so
long
hang
on
let
a
fella
get
organized
that's
my
radio
and
you're
what
shocked
and
disappointed
i'm
evil
so
what
kind
of
place
are
you
looking
for
i
don't
know
maybe
a
crypt
some
place
you
know
dark
and
dank
but
not
as
dark
and
dank
as
this
heh
it's
pretty
depressing
isn't
it
i've
known
corpses
with
a
fresher
smell
in
fact
i've
been
one
that's
it
let's
go
wait
i
want
to
give
you
something
for
your
new
place
that's
my
lamp
a
gift
is
traditional
i've
read
about
it
that's
among
friends
with
bitter
enemies
we
don't
give
them
my
lamp
it's
not
gonna
have
electricity
anyway
it's
a
crypt
remember
what
about
running
water
a
fridge
to
keep
your
blood
fresh
no
well
that's
gotta
suck
you
should
just
get
a
hotel
room
or
something
demon
girl's
got
a
point
i
need
fresh
blood
if
i
had
a
few
bob
for
a
room
with
an
honor
bar
out
before
i
get
the
slayer
over
here
to
kick
your
ass
out
don't
know
why
she
didn't
come
say
goodbye
shed
a
few
tears
well
she
has
an
appointment
with
somebody
who's
actually
still
scary
so
the
slayer
yeah
that's
me
we
thought
you
were
a
myth
well
you
were
mythtaken
and
to
think
all
that
time
you
were
sitting
in
my
class
well
most
of
those
times
i
always
knew
you
could
do
better
than
a
b
minus
now
i
understand
your
energies
were
directed
in
the
same
places
as
ours
in
fact
it's
only
our
methods
that
differ
we
use
the
latest
in
scientific
technology
and
stateoftheart
weaponry
and
you
if
i
understand
correctly
poke
them
with
a
sharp
stick
well
it's
more
effective
than
it
sounds
oh
i'm
heh
quite
sure
of
that
as
i'm
just
as
sure
that
we
can
learn
much
from
each
other
i'm
working
on
getting
you
clearance
to
come
into
the
initiative
i
think
you'll
find
the
results
of
our
operation
most
impressive
agent
finn
here
alone
has
killed
or
captured
how
many
is
it
seventeen
eleven
vampires
six
demons
oh
wow
i
mean
that's
seventeen
what
about
you
me
how
many
hostiles
would
you
say
you've
slain
glancing
back
and
forth
between
them
buffy
is
considering
and
from
her
expression
we
know
it's
more
than
17
third
new
moon
after
the
ninehundredth
feast
of
delthrox
oh
crap
no
we
can't
wait
for
her
willow
the
demon
prince
barvain
is
going
to
rise
tonight
well
where
is
she
exactly
wow
those
are
my
best
stories
and
i
didn't
tell
you
the
buffy
breaks
her
butt
stories
but
you've
killed
a
you
did
the
thing
with
that
uh
you
drowned
and
the
snake
not
to
mention
the
daily
slayage
of
wow
it's
no
big
really
hey
who
wants
ice
cream
buffy
when
i
saw
you
stop
the
world
from
you
know
ending
i
just
assumed
that
was
a
big
week
for
you
turns
out
i
suddenly
find
myself
needing
to
know
the
plural
of
apocalypse
look
if
you've
been
fighting
since
you
were
fifteen
you'd
have
a
hefty
resume'
too
fifteen
i
know
wow
the
point
is
that
that
we
have
different
amounts
of
experience
you
know
and
plus
i
do
have
that
whole
preternatural
slayer
strength
deal
i've
seen
don't
get
me
wrong
the
girls
i
grew
up
with
could
hold
their
own
but
i'm
not
even
sure
i
could
take
you
that
all
depends
on
your
meaning
yeah
professor
walsh
i
presume
you're
hard
to
find
thesethese
halls
are
quite
the
labyrinth
i
felt
like
theseus
and
the
minotaur
in
the
labyrinth
can
i
help
you
with
something
mr

giles
rupert
i'm
looking
for
buffy
summers
i'm
uh
a
friend
of
hers
and
i
was
her
high
school
librarian
i'm
sorry
buffy's
not
here
but
if
i
see
her

buffy's
been
very
influenced
by
your
cause
she
quotes
you
quite
often
sometimes
she
sounds
like
an
introductory
textbook
herself
i
don't
lecture
from
the
text
book
but
i'm
glad
she's
inspired
by
the
material
she's
bright
all
she's
really
been
lacking
is
encouragement
in
the
academic
sect
oh
uh
i
think
it's
best
ifif
if
we
let
a
young
person
find
their
own
strengths
if
you
lead
a
child
by
the
hand
then
they'll
never
find
their
own
footing
and
if
it's
true
about
hiking
ergo
it
must
be
true
about
life
that's
not
uh
i'm
just
saying
buffy
is
uh
well
she's
not
the
typical
student
once
you
get
to
know
her
she's
a
very
unique
girl
i
hope
you're
not
going
to
push
her
i
think
i
do
know
her
and
i
have
found
her
to
be
a
unique
woman
woman
of
course
how
wrong
of
me
to
choose
my
own
words
she's
very
selfreliant
very
independent
exactly
which
is
not
always
a
good
thing
i
think
it
can
be
unhealthy
to
take
on
adult
roles
too
early
what
i
suspect
i'm
seeing
is
a
reaction
to
the
absence
of
a
male
role
model
absence
buffy
clearly
lacks
a
strong
father
figure
i'm
sorry
i
have
things
to
do
i'll
tell
buffy
her
friend
was
looking
for
her
this
princedemon
guy
was
supposed
to
rise
at
sunset
so
aren't
we
like
late
of
course
if
i
hadn't
had
to
search
the
globe
for
our
miss
summers
and
do
battle
with
that
harridan

and
if
you
hadn't
gotten
lost
on
campus
afterwards

never
mind
i'll
just
have
to
take
care
of
it
myself
i've
vanquished
a
few
demons
in
my
day
without
her
of
course
it
wouldn't
surprise
me
if
we're
entirely
too
late
demon
on
the
loose
carnage
everywhere
your
better
demons
will
clean
up
after
themselves
i
don't
understand
umm
there
should
be
ruptured
earth
andand
broken
stone
oh
well
apparently
it
hasn't
happened
yet
a
bit
of
luck
or
you
know
what
i
bet
ii
bet
the
initiative
took
care
of
it
who
oh
riley
and
his
guys
probably
all
over
it
yeah
it
has
that
too
neat
look
they
must
have
cleaned
up
the
place
what
oh
they
read
hot
spots
areas
of
otherworldly
energy
they
must've
picked
this
place
up
days
ago
stop
both
of
you
uh
what
uh
what
are
you
talking
about
wwhat's
the
initiative
what
what
on
earth
does
it
have
to
do
with
buffy's
new
boyfriend
you
know
i'm
sure
you
know
riley's
one
of
the
commandos
what
well
that's
marvelous
isn't
it
here
i
am
spent
weeks
trying
uh
tto
get
a
single
scrap
of
information
about
our
mysterious
demon
collectors
and
no
one
bothers
to
tell
me
that
buffy's
dating
one
of
them
who
else
knows
no
one
no
one
else
knows
this
anya
and
that's
it
and
spike
ssspike
spike

only
the
basic
stuff
you
know
that
riley
is
a
commando
and
professor
walsh
is
in
charge
professor
walsh
that
fishwife
you
know
she's
actually
not
that
bad

little
late
wwe'll
just
you

am
i
kidding
nothing
is
gonna
happen
he
leaves
closing
it
behind
him
and
all
is
quiet
for
a
moment
then
we
see
the
back
of
a
man
wearing
a
gray
trench
coat
step
into
the
frame
looking
at
the
closed
door
i
wouldn't
say
that
i
wouldn't
say
that
at
all
in
fact
ripper

going
to
need
time

kicking
my
ass

more
fun
for
me
just
tell
me
what
you
want
to
tell
me
oh
so
crass
we
used
to
be
friends
ripper
when

fall
apart
the
same
time
you
started
to
worship
chaos
oh
religious
intolerance
sad
there
i
mean
just
look
at
the
irish
troubles
oh
hang
on
i'll
tell
ya
something
happening
in
the
darkworlds
it's
always
been
rumors
out
there
but
only
one
thing's
coming
through
clear
that
something's
harming
demons
and
it's
not
the
slayer
know
anything
about
it
what
are
they
saying
heh
you
know
demons
it's
all
exaggeration
and
blank
verse
pain
as
bright
as
steel
things
like
that
they're
scared
there's
something
called
314
that's
got
them
scared
most
of
all
the
kind
of
scared
that
turns
to
angry
i
know
we're
not
particularly
fond
of
each
other
rupert
but
we
are
a
couple
of
old
mystics
this
knew
outfit
it's
blundering
into
new
places
it
doesn't
belong
it's
throwing
the
worlds
out
of
balance
and
that's
way
beyond
chaos
mate
we're
headed
quite
literally
for
one
hell
of
a
fight
cut
to
close
up
of
buffy
throwing
jabs
at
the
camera
high
shot
we
see
she
is
sparring
with
riley
on
workout
mats
circling
each
other
he's
dressed
in
sweats
and
a
tshirt
buffy's
in
a
white
long
sleeve
shirt
and
blue
jeans
with
a
scarf
wrapped
over
her
long
flowing
hair
she
throws
a
few
more
jabs
and
he
blocks
them
and
counters
with
a
onetwo
combo
buffy
easily
ducks
under
they
continue
to
circle
buffy
launches
three
roundkicks
in
quick
succession
he
blocks
the
first
two
then
sidesteps
the
third
gets
up
behind
her
and
wrapping
his
arms
around
her

sadistic
and
selfcentered
here's
to
me
the
world
has
past
us
by
someone
snuck
in
and
left
us
a
couple
of
hasbeens
in
our
place
this
initiative
i
mean
their
methods
may
be
causing
problems
but
they're
getting
the
job
done
where
am
i
i'm
an
unemployed
librarian
with
a
tendency
to
get
knocked
on
the
head
well
we
won't
have
to
worry
about
that
anymore
now
mate
when
you
went
to
the
loo
i
slipped
a
small
pellet
of
poison
in
your
drink
you'll
be
dead
in
an
hour
just
kidding
i'm
gonna
feel
like
hell
in
the
morning
relax
enjoy
the
night
we're
just
a
couple
of
sorcerers
the
night
is
still
our
time
time
of
magic
to
magic
i'm
glad
you
wanted
to
get
together
i
know
it's
late
thanks
i
was
happy
you
called
we'll
start
out
slow
okay
willow
yeah
start
out
slow
doing
what
oh
we're
gonna
float
the
rose
then
use
the
majiks
to
pluck
the
petals
off
one
at
a
time
it's
a
test
of
synchronicity
our
minds
have
to
be
perfectly
attuned
to
work
as
a
single
delicate
implement
cool
and
it
should
be
very
pretty
it
worked
now
for
the
hard
part
the
petals
they
begin
to
concentrate
again
looking
at
the
rose
when
the
rose
suddenly
shoots
off
across
the
room
surprised
they
stand
and
watch
as
the
rose
ricochets
off
the
walls
a
few
times
and
have
to
duck
to
avoid
it
it
finally
comes
straight
down
on
the
four
point
star
and
we
see
that
it
is
petalless
but
smoking
what
the
heck
was
that
i
don't
know
but
uh
the
petals
are
off
cut
to
exterior
shot
of
giles'
apartment
building
morning
giles'
citroen
is
parked
by
the
curb
cut
to
interior
shot
giles'
loft
an
alarm
buzzer
goes
off
and
we
see
a
body
moving
under
a
sheet
on
the
bed
and
the
alarm
is
shut
off
dissolve
to
shot
of
panted
legs
walking
down
the
stairs
i
feel
like
hell
in
the
morning
we
see
giles
reach
the
landing
and
stop
in
front
of
a
small
mirror
hanging
on
the
wall
while
he
releases
a
big
yawn
stretching
his
arms
we
see
that
giles
is
a
demon
light
brownish
tan
skin
with
long
horns
sprouting
from
the
sides
of
his
forehead
curving
back
and
around
his
really
long
hairy
ears
ending
in
sharp
points
next
to
his
cheeks
as
he
yawns
he
shows
us
a
set
a
fangs
much
like
a
vampire's
he
smacks
his
lips
when
the
yawn
is
done
and
finally
opens
his
sleepy
eyes
and
sees
his
new
form
for
the
first
time
uh
wha
wha
no
damn
ethan
oh
and
i
liked
that
shirt
i
like
pancakes
'cause
they're
stackable
ooo
and
waffles
'cause
you
can
put
things
in
the
little
holes
if
you
wanted
to
you
should
always
have
a
new
boyfriend
you're
so
much
fun
right
now
hey
i
didn't
hear
you
come
in
last
night
where
were
you
the
chem
lab
by
myself
ii
was
trying
this
new
spell
floating
a
rose
when
all
of
a
sudden
zing
zing
zing
like
all
over
the
room
it
was
like
a
rosebased
missile
yikes
i
know
i
think
there's
something
out
there
ii
felt
this
presence
this
dark
majiks
energy
blocking
the
spell
it's
new
someone
else
doing
majiks
maybe
if
so
it's
someone
pretty
powerful
hmm
i'll
tell
giles
about
it
or
maybe
i'll
tell
maggie
she
seemed
kind
of
interested
in
learning
the
mystical
side
of
the
whole
demon
hunting
biz
tell
giles
he's
feeling
a
little
hurt
right
now
how
come
you
never
told
him
about
riley
being
a
commando
i
did
i
didn't
he
says
no
he's
feeling
neglected
and
outoftheloopy
well
i
didn't
at
first
because
riley
said
not
to
and
and
then
meow
cat
out
of
the
bag
and
ii
guess
i
just
forgot
that
he
didn't
know
i'll
make
it
up
to
him
when
i
see
him
tomorrow
i'm
spending
today
with
riley
oh
yeah
i
forgot
that's
what
you
always
do
on
the
days
when
the
earth
rotates
it's
just
going
so
well
right
now
i
think
i
hope
i
sort
of
kicked
him
across
the
room
last
night
uh
that's
not
good
well
we
were
sparring
and
he
said
not
to
hold
back
and
he's
a
little
dented
but
he
said
he
was
okay
with
it
and
i
think
he's
okay
with
it
dodo
you
think
he's
okay
with
it
i'm
sure
he
is
i
mean
if
he's
not
you
know
you
had
to
do
it
he's
right
you
can't
walk
around
pretending
you're
less
than
you
are
it
wouldn't
be
right
for
you
to
hold
back
right

held

little
still
asleep

really
like
this
feeling
sort
of
mindless
need
to
destroy
this
anger
and
rage
good
times
go
with
it
no
oh
it's
fun
i
can't
do
it
do
it
for
me
now
let

i
refuse
to
become
a
monster
because
i
look
like
a
monster
i
have
a
soul
i
have
a
conscience
i
am
a
human
being
oh
stop
the
car
the
citroen
pulls
to
a
stop
at
the
corner
of
main
street
and
we
see
that
professor
walsh
has
just
crossed
the
street
giles
hops
out
of
the
car
without
his
blanket
and
creeps
up
behind
her
when
he's
close
enough
he
roars
and
waves
his
claws
in
the
air
walsh
looks
over
her
shoulder
and
screams
like
a
woman
and
runs
for
her
life
as
giles
chases
her
down
the
street
pass
the
espresso
pump
he
stops
halfway
down
the
street
but
walsh
continues
to
flee
giles
hurries
back
to
the
car
ignoring
the
gaping
stares
of
a
few
pedestrians
right
let's
go
then
while
we're
still
laughing
our
asses
off
we
go
back
to
giles's
apartment
our
gang
is
gathered
around
the
sofa
xander
willow
and
anya
are
sitting
on
the
cushions
and
buffy
is
sitting
on
the
arm
of
the
sofa
and
riley
is
standing
behind
it
xander
points
into
the
book
he's
holding
and
passes
it
to
willow
that's
the
thing
that
attacked
me
a
fyarl
demon
sort
of
a
foot
soldier
type
works
for
other
demons
lots
of
the
times
very
strong
ugh
and
hey

mucous
agent

i
understand
the
demon
attacked
professor
walsh
got
out
of
a
small
gray
car
a
citroen
it
stole
giles'
car
why
would
a
demon
steal
a
car
why
would
a
demon
steal
that
car
a
demon
that
steals
a
car
has
a
reason
a
purpose
but
it
doesn't
sound
like
these
fyarl
demons
are
really
big
independent
thinkers
so
will
the
spells
that
are
going
wrong
could
they
be
caused
by
someone
using
majiks
to
control
a
demon
making
this
fyarl
demon
attack
giles
yes
yeah
that
would
draw
in
a
lot
of
dark
energy
okay
willow
xander
stay
here
who's
ever
controlling
this
demon
may
call

a
little
concerned

not
sure

he's
wrong
about
them
i'm
not
dating
the
initiative
i'm
dating
riley
he's
a
good
guy
and
ii
believe
that
but
he's
part
of
something
wewe
don't
really
understand
you
sure
you're
not
just
saying
this
because
you
don't
like
riley's
boss
no
no
i'm
not
saying
that
at
all
though
i
do
hate
her
quite
a
lot
but
i
want
you
to
have
your
personal
life
but
keep
your
eyes
open
make
sure
you
know
what
you're
getting
into
cut
to
the
underground
headquarters
of
the
initiative
riley
is
walking
with
walsh
across
the
large
complex
in
the
background
we
can
see
several
lab
techs
and
military
personnel
moving
about
as
well
as
the
two
parked
humvees
that
were
unable
to
catch
an
old
grampa
car
so
she
walks
in
and
the
rules
just
suddenly
break
umm
pretty
much
be
careful
with
her
she
reacts
on
instinct
there's
no
discipline
there
her
loyalties
are
uncertain
you
won't
be
disappointed
in
her
she's
good
at
what
she
does
she
is
the
truest
soul
i've
ever
known
oh
no
oh
no
spontaneous
poetic
exclamations
lord
spare
me
college
boys
in
love
i'm
just
saying
she'll
work
out
you'll
be
proud
of
her
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
i
think
you're
probably
right
riley
smiles
then
moves
off
leaving
walsh
who
swipes
an
id
card
through
a
keypad
and
steps
inside
the
security
door
cut
to
interior
we
see
walsh
walk
a
short
distance
down
a
white
corridor
and
punch
a
code
into
another
keypad
and
slide
the
id
card
through
again
the
door
she
is
standing
in
front
of
unlocks
and
she
opens
it
and
disappears
inside
it
closes
again
and
we
see
a
number
stenciled
into
the
door
314
