all
the
splashing

jumping
and
running
shouldn't
relaxing
involve
less
exertion

exertion

lead
to
sweatiness
which
can
cause
the
pain
and
heartbreak
of
stinkiness
better
to
just
stay

ignis
incende
willow
check

to
the
ground
cracking
open
slightly
leaning
at
an
angle
with
one
end
on
the
ground
and
the
other
leaning
on
the
truck

little
dirt

out
of
the
box
and
slashes
his
throat
he
screams
and
staggers
backward
the
other
guy
watches
in
horror
as
a
body
begins
to
burst
out
of
the
box
cut
to
exterior
shot
of
giles'
building

let's
get
scannin'
i
want
to
see
this
puppy
go
start
with
those
start
where
is
finish
willow
it's
essential
that
we
begin
archiving
the
library
i
mean
most
of
these
texts
have
no
duplicates
but
now
doesn't
winter
seem
more
like
archiving
season
well
you
don't
have
to
willow
i
mean
you're
you're
welcome
to
leave
if
uh

just
you've
been
mr
project
all
summer
you
know
labeling
the
amulets
and
indexing
your
diaries
i
draw
the
line
at
making
giant
rubber
band
balls
that's
when
you'll
just
have
to
get
a
life
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
do
actually
is
um
get
a
life
it
might
go
better
if
you
left
the
house
willow
um
you
mustn't
repeat
what
i'm
about
to
say
especially
not
to
buffy
uhoh
you
promise
oh
god
well
i
guess
now
that
i
know
there's
something
to
know
i
can't
not
know
just
because
i'm
afraid
somebody'll
know
i
know
you
know
did
that
mean
yes
yeah
we're
doing
all
this
because
i
i
want
you
and
the
others
to
have
everything
you
need
at
your
fingertips
you
see
i'm
i'm
going
back
to
england
you're
what
but
you
can't
you're
buffy's
watcher
i
mean
in
a
fired
way
but
well
it's
become
quite
obvious
that
buffy
doesn't
need
me
ii
don't
say
that
in
a
selfpitying
way
i'm
i'm
quite
proud
actually
but
what
about
the
rest
of
us
we
still
need
to
be
watched
personally
i
can't
get
through
a
day
without
a
little
hairy
eyeball
i
appreciate
the
sentiment
but
it's
it's
just
not
so
you'll
be
fine
you
all
will
and
you
know
we'll
we'll
stay
in
touch
you
can
always
call
me
whenever
you
like
when
are
you
gonna
tell
buffy
soon
it
won't
be
easy
but
um
i
know
she'll
understand
thanks

you
know
i'm
gonna
have
to
get
used
to
this
place
without
you

gets
so
quiet
you
know
maybe
we
should
make
a
regular
date
of
this
when
school
starts
mm
i'm
sorry
duty
calls
it's
a
total
drag
very
impressive
hunt

was
just
another
day
on
the
job
care
to
step
up
for
some
overtime
we're
not
going
to
fight
do
you
know
what
a
slayer

i
apologize
i
assumed
you
knew
i
am
dracula

what
if
somebody
had
a
secret
and
that
somebody
promised
somebody
else
that
they
wouldn't
tell
anyone
news
flash
will
everybody
knows
no
thithis
isn't
about
me
and
tara
oh
well
not
that
i
wouldn't
be
all
ears
if
you
wanted
to
tell
me
a
secret
about
you
two
even
if
it
was
very
very
naughty
sorry
this
is
of
the
nonnaughty
variety
and
i'm
not
telling
you
okay
want
to
see
if
buffy's
hanging
around
the
headstones
sure
so
if
i
was
gonna
tell
you
which
i'm
not
going
to
so
lemme
get
this
straight
you're

dracula
the
guy
the
count
i
am
and
you're
sure
this
isn't
just
some
fanboy
thing
cause
i've
fought
more
than
a
couple
of
pimply
overweight
vamps
that
called
themselves
lestat
you
know
who
i
am
as
i
would
now
without
question
that
you
are
buffy
summers
you're
heard
of
me
naturally
you're
known
throughout
the
world
naw
really
why
else
would
i
come
here
for
the
sun
i
came
to
meet
the
renowned
killer
yeah
i
prefer
the
term
slayer
you
know
killer
just
sounds
so
naked
like
i
paint
clowns
or
something
i'm
the
good
guy
remember
perhaps
but
your
power
is
rooted
in
darkness
you
must
feel
it
no
you
know
what
i
feel
bored
okay
that's
cheating
hey
buff
what's
up
you
look
like
you
just
buffy
get
out
of
here
now
fine
but
i
was
gonna
give
you
a
sip
of
my
doublemint
mocha
but
behind
you
hi
nice
look
who's
got
a
bad
case
of
dark
prince
envy
i
have
no
interest
in
you
leave
us
no
we're
not
going
to
leave
you
and
where'd
you
get
that
accent
sesame
street
vun
two
three
three
victims
mwa
ha
ha
xander
i'm
pretty
sure
that's
dracula
wow
really
hey
sorry
man
i
was
just
jokin'
around
this
is
not
the
time
i
will
see
you
soon
bat
ooh
bat
and
then
buffy's
all
look
out
cut
to
inside
giles'
apartment
and
then
frigging
dracula's
standing
right
behind
us
and
then
he
lunges
at
us
like
whoosh
he
totally
looked
shorter
in
person
i
told
you
he'd
heard
of
me
right
i
mean
can
you
believe
that
count
famous
heard
of
me
i
couldn't
believe
it
the
first
twenty
times
you
told
us
but
it's
starting
to
sink
in
now
i'm
sorry
am
i
repeatogirl
i
was
just
blown
away
it's
not
that
surprising
that
he's
heard
of
you
buffy
you
are
the
slayer
i
guess
just
the
way
he
said
it
you
know
i
mean
he
made
it
sound
so
sexy
i
bet
he
made
it
sound
sexy
kinda
he
of
the
dark
penetrating
eyes
and
lilty
accent
i
wonder
if
he
knows
frankenstein
you
thought
dracula
was
sexy
oh
no
he
he
was
yuck
right
except
for
the
whole
tall
dark
and
handsome
thing
yucko
how
would
you
know
well
we
hung
out
a
few
times
back
in
my
demon
days
you
know
once
or
twice
he's
pretty
cool
you
know
from
from
a
whole
evil
thing
perspective
please
he
was
no
big
whoop
no
big
whoop
what
about
that
thing
where
he
turned
himself
into
a
bat
that
was
awesome
it
must
have
been
yes
i
must
admit
i'm
sorry
i
missed
that
me
too
the
whole
time
i
was
thinking
'gosh
i
wish
giles
were
here
he'd
know
what
to
do'
giles
smiles
tolerantly
he
knows
what
she's
trying
to
do
didn't
you
guys
think
that
actually
i
was
more
thinking
'bat'
how
come
he
can
do
that
i
i
have
no
idea
there's
a
great
deal
of
myth
about
dracula
i
imagine
the
trick
to
defeating
him
lies
in
separating
the
fact
from
the
fiction
great
point
that
is
so
giles
to
think
of
something
like
that
you
know
that
that
we
would
have
never
so
we
should
take
things
slow
with
dracula
i
mean
he
said
that
we
would
meet
again
but
i
would
like
to
avoid
that
until
we
do
some
serious
homework
i
don't
know
i
mean
he
may
have
a
bunch
of
swell
party
tricks
but
he's
still
just
a
vampire
i
say
we
load
up
with
stakes
and
crossbows
and
go
after
him
now
second
no
buffy's
right
dracula's
too
slick
to
fall
for
the
usual
stuff
so
we
hold
off
no
killing
until
we
know
exactly
what
we're
dealing
with
you're
not
just
saying
that
because
of
those
dark
penetrating
eyes
of
his
are
you
noooo
his
eyes
were

there
were
there
was
no
penetration
cross
my
heart
all
right
willow
you
and
tara
find
out
everything
you
can
about
the
actual
legend
of
vlad
the
impaler
on
the
internet
and
uh
i'll
check
the
library
if
the
initiative
was
still
around
we'd
be
able
to
find
everything
on
this
guy
in
a
few
hours
we
might
not
be
as
fast
but
we'll
find
him
you
guys
we'll
reconvene
here
in
the
morning
what's
your
plan
big
sleep
my
count
encounter
wiped
me
out
i'm
kinda
wired
maybe
i
should
just
let
you
get
your
rest
you
sure
i
mean
maybe
if
you
just
lie
down
with
me
nothing
you
are
about
to
say
will
lead
to
rest
i
guess
you're
right
i'll
see
you
in
the
morning
mmhmm
with
donuts
mm
heaven
see
a
little
sugar
and
i'm
all
yours
dracula
schmacula
i
doubt
he'd
remember
me
i
was
just
a
silly
young
thing
i
mean
like
seven
hundred
or
so
but
he
did
say
that
this
guy
i
cursed
was
doomed
forever
which
was
really
sweet
don't
you
think
adorable
it
was
a
great
spell
i
made
this
jerk
incredibly
fat
like
a
human
minivan
you
should
just
mention
my
name
if
you
see
him
again
or
better
yet
why
don't
you
just
go
sit
on
top
of
a
crypt
and
flaunt
your
neck
cleavage
until
dracula
shows
up
then
you
two
can
talk
private
oh
please
don't
tell
me
you're
jealous
oh
no
just
because
you're
panting
over
the
guy
i
am
not
panting
now
stop
being
silly
i'll
see
you
tomorrow
you
don't
wanna
come
back
to
my
place
it's
whites
day
remember
the
bleach
smell
makes
me
nauseous
fine
i
suppose
dracula
doesn't
use
bleach
huh
he's
a
darksonly
man
great
perfect
you
know
what
you're
not
so
big
one
round
of
oldfashioned
fisticuffs
you'd
fold
like
a
bitty
baby
okay
let's
do
it
and
no
poofing
come
on
puffy
shirt
pucker
on
up
'cause
you
can
kiss
your
pale
ass
dracula
silence
yes
master
no
that's
not
dracula
you
will
be
my
emissary
my
eyes
and
ears
in
daylight
your
emissary
serve
me
well
you
will
be
rewarded
i
will
make
you
an
immortal
a
child
of
darkness
that
feeds
on
life
itself
on
blood
blood
yes
yes
i
will
serve
you
your
excellent
spookiness
or
master
i'll
just
stick
with
master
you
are
strange
and
offputting
go
now
but
master
how
can
i
find
brilliant
what
an
exit
guy's
a
genius
well
well
you
can
take
the
boy
out
of
the
initiative
but
you
can't
take
the
initiative
out
of
the
boy
i'd
put
that
down
unless
you're
bucking
for
one
hell
of
a
headache
i
can't
be
too
careful
i
got
quite
a
few
demons
after
me
these
days
i'm
looking
for
some
information
might
pay
a
little
i'll
play
what
can
you
tell
me
about
dracula
dracula
poncy
bugger
owes
me
eleven
pounds
for
one
thing
you
know
him
know
him
we're
old
rivals
but
then
he
got
famous
forgot
all
about
his
foes
i'll
tell
you
what
that
glory
hound's
done
more
harm
to
vampires
than
any
slayer
his
story
gets
out
and
suddenly
everybody
knows
how
to
kill
us
you
know
the
mirror
bit
but
he's
not
just
a
regular
vampire
i
mean
he
has
special
powers
right
nothing
but
showy
gypsy
stuff
what's
it
to
you
anyway
he's
in
town
making
his
presence
known
drac's
in
sunnydaleway
i
guess
the
old
boy
needed
closure
after
all
actually
he's
gunning
for
buffy
but
i'm
out
to
find
him
before
he
gets
another
shot
at
her
tough
talk
cowboy
but
you're
not
gonna
catch
him
napping
in
a
crypt
no
the
count
has
to
have
his
luxury
estate
and
his
bugeaters
and
his
special
dirt
don't
he
so
you're
saying
i
should
check
out
mansions
that
sort
of
thing
no
i'm
saying
you
should
go
home
to
your
superhoney
have
a
nice
safe
snog
you're
out
of
your
depth
on
this
one
boy
you've
helped
buffy
before
so
she
has
a
problem
with
killing
you
now
that
you're
helpless
i
don't
i'd
like
to
see
you
try
would
you
pfft
you're
never
gonna
find
him
not
before
he
gets
to
her
you
are
magnificent
i
bet
you
say
that
before
you
bite
all
the
girls
no
you
are
different
kindred
kindred
hardly
i
dracula
pull
your
hair
back
this
isn't
how
i
usually
fight
you
think
you
can
just
waft
in
here
with
your
music
video
wind
and
your
hypnoeyes
i
have
searched
the
world
over
for
you
i
have
yearned
for
you
for
a
creature
whose
darkness
rivals
my
own
you
have
been
tasted
he
was
dracula
unworthy
he
let
you
go
but
the
embrace
his
bite
you
remember
no
do
not
fight
i
can
feel
your
hunger
here's
a
jelly
one
you
want
it
no
got
it
got
it
mine
mine
well
i
think
we
have
dracula
factoids
like
any
of
that's
enough
to
fight
the
dark
master
bator
a
lot
of
it
we
already
knew
turnoffs
wood
fire
crosses
garlic
turnons
nice
duds
minions
long
slow
bites
that
last
for
days
yeah
i
did
a
little
research
too
dracula
likes
to
live
in
style
which
means
we
can
rule
out
the
usual
dumps
vampires
haunt
ah
but
he's
smart
enough
to
figure
that
we
probably
already
know
that
i'm
guessing
he's
lying
low
actually
my
research
backs
riley
up
drac
isn't
the
laylow
type
so
we
can
uh
check
out
the
nicer
places
don't
you
think
buffy
buffy
yeah
we'll
check
all
the
swanky
places
first
what
else
did
you
guys
get
well
willow
has
most
of
it
actually
only
because
you
gave
me
super
pointers
i
never
would
have
just
go
ahead
willow
ok
dracula's
modus
operandi
is
different
from
other
vampires
he
will
kill
just
to
feed
but
he'd
rather
have
a
connection
with
his
victims
and
he
has
all
of
these
mental
powers
to
draw
them
in
he
he
can
read
and
control
minds
appear
in
dreams
uh
huh
makes
sense
that
stare
he
just
kinda
looked
right
through
you
didn't
you
feel
it
buffy
no
no
i
didn't
see
buffy
didn't
feel
it
i
think
you're
drawing
a
low
of
crazy
conclusions
about
the
unholy
prince
bator
the
point
is
though
he
goes
through
the
motions
of
an
intimate
seduction
the
end
result
is
the
same
he
turns
them
into
a
vampire
well
that
is
intimate
dracula's
gifting
these
ladies
with
his
own
blood
and
blood

blood
is
life
according
to
them
um
just
be
aware
that
he
he
tends
to
form
a
relationship
with
his
prey
it's
not
enough
for
him
to
take
her
she
must
want
to
be
taken
she
must
burn
for
him
that's
interesting
i'm
gonna
go
find
him
you
shouldn't
go
by
yourself
buffy
i
mean
this
guy's
seriously
dangerous
it's
cool
i
got
it
hey
take
off
that
scarf
what
no
you're
under
the
thrall
of
the
dark
prince
i
am
not
under
the
thrall
of
the
dark
prince
then
take
off
the
scarf
oh
let
go
of
me
this
is
ridiculous
why
didn't
you
say
anything
'cause
she
didn't
want
to
worry
us
right
buffster
it's
nothin'
just
a
scratch
two
deep
puncturey
scratches
i'm
not
sure
why
i
tried
to
hide
it
uh
there
was
just
this
voice
and
it
was
it
was
telling
me
to
cover
it
and
what
did
i
tell
you
that's
thrall
you're
saying
dracula
has
some
sort
of
freaky
mind
control
over
her
you're
watching
too
many
creature
features
man
but
it
does
seem
like
he
has
this
control
over
me
i
even
though
a
big
part
of
me
is
resisting
no
that's
okay
i
shouldn't
take
this
personally
i
mean
what
with
angel
i
mean
it's
understandable
that
there
would
be
transference
i
mean
they're
both
broody
immortals
i
am
not
transfery
i
swear
to
you
i'm
your
girl
and
i'm
gonna
stay
that
way
okay
but
you
are
not
going
anywhere
near
him
again
uh
riley's
right
you
should
you
should
stay
out
of
sight
let
the
rest
of
us
look
for
dracula
i
can't
go
home
he
already
got
inside
once
you
can
come
over
to
my
place
i'll
make
sure
you
stay
put
good
um
riley
and
i
can
uh
can
search
for
dracula
and
willow
you
and
tara
could
uh
could
do
a
protection
spell
on
buffy's
mother's
house
and
prevent
him
from
returning
got
it
how'd
he
get
inside
anyway
he
seemed
so
nice
and
normal
a
little
pale
a
good
sunnydale
rule
of
thumb
avoid
whiteskinned
men
in
capes
i'm
not
like
this
i
don't
invite
strange
men
over
for
coffee
it's
just
oh
when
you
girls
are
older
you'll
understand
it's
hard
to
date
sometimes
you
just
feel
like
giving
up
on
men
altogether
another
bust
and
it's
getting
dark
i
should
have
turned
up
a
better
lead
there
must
be
an
easier
way
to
find
him
too
late
to
worry
about
that
now
if
we
hurry
we
can
hit
these
last
places
how
come
i
have
to
be
here
slayersitting
while
the
other
guys
get
to
look
for
dracula
i
mean
just
because
i'm
xander
what
time
is
it
uh
almost
six
look
i
mean
i'm
the
one
who
knows
him
ii'm
the
one
who
had
a
really
good
look
at
him
and
so
i
mean
what
xander
pushes
her
into
the
closet
and
shuts
the
door
hey
what
i'm
supposed
to
deliver
you
to
the
master
now
there's
this
whole
deal
where
i
get
to
be
immortal
you
cool
with
that
take
me
to
him
master
i
deliver
the
slayer
she
who
you
most
desire
sorry
whom
so
now
comes
the
immortality
right
you
do
the
thing
and
dracula
leave
us
we
must
not
be
interrupted
you
bet
i
knew
you'd
come
why
because
i'm
under
your
thrall
well
guess
again
pal
put
the
stake
down
okay
right
that
was
not
you
i
did
that
i
did
that
because
i
wanted
to
maybe
i
should
rethink
that
thrall
thing
i've
lived
in
sunnydale
a
couple
of
years
now
know
what
i've
never
noticed
before
uh
a
castle
a
big
honking
castle
stay
away
from
me
are
you
afraid
i
will
bite
you
slayer
that's
why
you
came
no
last
night
it's
not
gonna
happen
again
stop
me
stake
me
i
any
minute
now
do
you
know
why
you
cannot
resist
'cause
you're
famous
because
you
do
not
want
to
my
friends
dracula
they're
here
they
will
not
find
us
we
are
alone
always
alone
there
is
so
much
i
have
to
teach
you
your
history
your
power
what
your
body
is
capable
of
i
don't
need
to
know
you
long
to
and
you
will
have
eternity
to
discover
yourself
but
first
a
little
taste
i
won't
let
you
i
didn't
mean
for
me
nobody
harms
my
master
your
master
you
want
him
you
come
through
me
okeydokey
oh

are
you

those
years

you've
never

know
what
it
is
that
we
fight
for
never
even
a
taste
if
i
drink
that
dracula
i
have
not
drunk
enough
for
you
to
change
you
must
be
near
death
to
become
one
of
us
and
that
comes
only
when
you
plead
for
it
i'm
not
hungry

craving
goes
deeper
than
that

dracubabes
like
giles
here
i
was
not
making
time
i
i
was
uh
just
about

those
uh
loathsome
creatures
when
riley

me
of
course

i
was
in
complete
control
you

something
that
i'd
like
to
talk
to
you
about
too
oh
well
you
go

no
i
insist
you

a
while
i
haven't
been
training
and
i
haven't
really
needed
to
come
to
you
for
help
i
agree
and
then
this
whole
thing
with
dracula
it
made
me
face
up
to
some
stuff
ever
since
we
did
that
spell
where
we
called
on
the
first
slayer
i've
been
going
out
a
lot
every
night
patrolling
hunting
that's
what
dracula
called
it
and
he
was
right
he
understood
my
power
better
than
i
do
he
saw
darkness
in
it
i
need
to
know
more
about
where
i
come
from
about
the
other
slayers
i
mean
maybe
maybe
if
i
could
learn
to
control
this
thing
i
could
be
stronger
i
could
be
better
but
i'm
scared
i
know
it's
gonna
be
hard
and
i
can't
do
it
without
you
i
need
your
help
i
need
you
to
be
my
watcher
again
boy
i
just
i
just
keep
talking

i
i'm
