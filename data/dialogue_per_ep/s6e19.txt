when
did
morning
happen
after
the
moon
went
down
mmm
i
forgot
how
good
this
could
feel
us
together
without
the
magic
there
was
plenty
of
magic
it's
getting
late
wanna
get
up
no
oh
god
no
i
was
just
thinking
about
buffy
oh
she
still
isn't
back
i
didn't
hear
her
she
wouldn't
talk
about
what
happened
at
the
magic
shop
when
she
got
home
last
night
she
just
wanted
to
know
how
close
i
was
to
tracing
the
camera
signal
back
to
the
empire
of
the
nerds
and
then
she
left
again
i'm
sure
she'll
be
okay
yeah
i'm
not
really
worried
about
her
going
up
against
warren
and
the
others
i
know
this
is
going
to
sound
crazy
but
i
think
something
might
be
going
on
with
spike
and
buffy
i
mean
she
looked
so
hurt
when
she
saw
him
with
anya
i
think
maybe
they've
been
sleeping
together
no
i
wouldn't
go
that
far
no
i
mean
she
told
me
they've
been
sleeping
together
sleeping
together
you
mean
like
the
naked
kind
of
together
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
say
anything
but
i
i
promised
her
i
wouldn't
does
everybody
else
know
am
i
the
only
one
she
didn't
god
no
she
she
didn't
even
mean
to
tell
me
it
just
came
out
how
could
she
hide
something
like
this
from
me
i
think
she
was
afraid
of
the
look
you'd
get
on
your
face
kinda
like
the
one
you're
wearing
now
oh
no
i'm
not
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
so
is
she
wow
she
probably
really
needs
someone
to
talk
to
probably
we've
been
kinda
busy
maybe
we
didn't
hear
her
come
home
buffy
she
back
yet
uh
not
yet
i'm
sure
she'll
be
home
soon
everything's
fine
just
go
back
to
bed
it's
ten
o'clock
oh
uh
you
don't
think
she's
gonna
hurt
spike
do
you
she
told
you
about
spike
it
was
kinda
obvious
after
last
night
yeah
i
totally
knew
it
must
have
hurt
so
much
to
see
him
and
and
and
anya
like
that
and
poor
xander
everything
is
so
screwed
up
it's
gonna
be
all
right
it's
just
complicated
you
know
when
when
people
have
such
strong
feelings
for
each
other
sometimes
is
she
back
yet
oh
hey
oh
you
and
uh
that's
my
cue
to
put
some
clothes
on
no
no
no
no
i'm
totally
not
here
you
guys
you
do
whatever
you
want
um
i'll
go
watch
tv
downstairs
really
loud
in
the
basement
where
i
can't
hear
anything
oh
my
god
i
love
you
guys
all
right
let's
make
this
quick
fine
but
i'm
not
leaving
till
we
have
a
little
chat
very
little
considering
the
pummeling
that
needs
to
occur
i
mean
guys
helloooo
slayer
here
did
you
honestly
think
i
wouldn't
find
you
well
that
can't
be
good
okay
that's
gonna
cost
ya
okay
we're
here
ready
for
action
uh
bad
guy
fighting
action
guys
you
didn't
have
to
you
know
if
you
still
wanna
be
alone
no
no
we're
good
we're
better
than
good
great
super
awww
okay
all
right
we'll
stop
oh
you
better
not
so
um
nerds
how
are
them
they
well
i
found
their
lair
but
they
obviously
knew
we
were
tracing
their
signal
they
left
in
a
hurry
van
was
gone
but
everything
else
was
still
there
we
should
go
back
uh
tara
and
i
can
sherlock
around
there's
nothing
left
there
now
giant
buzz
saw
it
was
a
thing
this
was
all
that
i
could
save
i
i
know
it's
not
much
but
we
need
to
go
through
it
and
see
if
we
can
find
anything
that
might
tell
us
what
what
they're
doing
where
they're
going
um
this
might
take
a
while
anything
we
can
do
to
fast
forward
we
really
need
to
find
warren
and
the
others
before
anyone
else
gets
hurt
should
we
call
xander
i
don't
think
he's
really
in
the
scooby
space
we
need
to
give
him
some
time
maybe
they've
heard
something
in
the
demon
bars
about
those
guys
spike
spike
spike's
not
part
of
the
team
so
he's
not
going
to
be
around
anymore
uh
i
don't
know
dawn
not
not
for
a
while
what
about
anya
she
might
be
able
to
help
with
some
of
the
demon
texts
i'm
guessing
she's
not
feeling
real
researchy
right
now
i
know
how
you
feel
maybe
i
can
help
how
could
carl
do
that
to
me
that
bastard
he's
a
man
look
no
further
but
with
my
sister
she's
not
even
pretty
well
it
isn't
always
about
looks
or
a
beating
heart
sometimes
intimate
sweaty
relations
with
the
wrong
person
just
seems
like
a
good
idea
at
the
time
she's
fat
he
cheated
on
me
with
my
fat
ugly
sister
likes
'em
fleshy
huh
bet
you
wish
he'd
bloat
up
a
coupla
thousand
pounds
and
pop
like
a
big
ol'
meat
zeppelin
don't
you
he
said
he
loved
me
oh
gee
then
he
must
have
meant
it
'cause
hey
guys
never
say
anything
they
don't
really
mean
do
they
but
we
they
say
i
love
you
and
and
you
think
it's
true
they
say
oh
anya
i
want
to
be
with
you
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
and
you
believe
them
you
believe
they
feel
the
same
way
about
you
because
that's
the
way
love's
supposed
to
be
right
who's
anya
and
then
you
get
all
excited
with
the
tingly
anticipation
but
wait
not
so
fast
there's
the
apocalypse
aand
the
back
from
the
grave
and
the
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
and
by
the
time
you're
finally
standing
there
in
that
beautiful
expensive
white
dress
you've
dreamed
about
ever
since
you
became
human
he's
gets
all
heebiejeebie
and
decides
you
know
i'd
rather
just
go
steady
men
suck
i
wish
carl's
flesh
would
and
you
know
he
said
it
isn't
me
but
how
can
i
believe
him
i
mean
he
knew
he
didn't
want
to
get
married
deep
down
he
knew
but
he
lied
to
me
every
day
for
months
i
wish
he
lied
and
lied
and
then
lied
some
more
'cause
hey
who's
gonna
notice
with
all
the
other
lies
flying
around
like
little
monkeys
and
then
he
thinks
he
can
just
sweep
the
carnage
underneath
the
rug
by
saying
oh
i'm
sorry
sorry
sorry
please
i'll
never
try
to
desecrate
your
chamber
again
just
don't
hurt
me
please
hit
him
again
hit
him
again
wow
these
things
are
tougher
than
i
thought
you
know
one
jolt
from
this
should
have
dropped
an
elephant

you
want
a
piece
of
this
huh

so
tough

bait

time

the
thing

afraid
of

hey
hey
i
think
there's
still
a
cold
one
in
the
fridge
thanks
but
uh
i
think
it's
still
a
little
early
for
me
she
loves
you
you
know
that
anya
was
just
she
was
hurting
she
was
hurting
and
and
she
did
this
really
stupid
thing
with
your
boyfriend
he's
not
my
boyfriend
i
know
why
anya
i
understand
i
do
but
you
all
those
times
i
told
spike
to
get
lost
that
he
didn't
have
a
chance
with
a
girl
like
you
you
don't
know
how
hard
it's
been
what
lying
to
me
being
here
after
i
was
brought
back
you
have
no
idea
how
hard
it
is
just
being
here
you
could
have
told
me
you
didn't
want
to
know
so
you
went
to
him
instead
xander
what
i
do
with
my
personal
life
is
none
of
your
business
it
used
to
be
it
just
happened
okay
oh
like
uh
say
you're
evil
get
on
me
you
fought
side
by
side
with
him
when
i
was
gone
you
let
him
take
care
of
dawn
but
i
never
forgot
what
he
really
is
god
what
were
you
thinking
you're
asking
me
that
oh
'cause
your
decision
making
skills
have
really
sparkled
lately
i'm
not
saying
i
didn't
make
any
mistakes
but
last
time
i
checked
slaughtering
half
of
europe
wasn't
one
of
them
he
doesn't
have
a
soul
buffy
just
some
leash
they
jammed
in
his
head
you
think
he'd
still
be
all
snuggles
if
that
chip
ever
stopped
working
would
you
still
trust
him
with
dawn
then
it
doesn't
matter
i'm
not
seeing
him
anymore
it's
over
yeah
there's
a
lot
of
that
going
around
it's
all
a
mess
these
things
take
time
we'll
figure
it
out
sure
we'll
decipher
codes
foil
evil
schemes
finally
get
out
of
bed
i
was
with
you
up
until
there
whoa
what
is
it
uh
one
of
their
data
cds
it's
filled
with
encrypted
blueprints
schematics
to
what
i'm
not
sure
the
designations
have
been
stripped
maybe
we
can
crossreference
them
with
the
county
clerk's
office
would
that
involve
getting
up
eventually
then
i'm
coming
out
firmly
against
it
what
about
the
trio's
evil
scheme
well
i'm
kinda
busy
working
on
my
own
you're
all
wet
it's
a
good
thing
i'm
part
fish
which
part
the
part
with
the
hook
in
it
careful
someone
might
reel
you
in
yeah
but
then
there'd
be
the
flopping
and
the
gasping
and
sure
maybe
it'd
work
out
but
chances
are
i'd
up
and
leave
you
at
the
helm
in
your
white
dress
then
find
you
spawning
with
another
fish
who
turns
out
to
be
spawning
my
very
good
friend
night
and
day
behind
my
back
then
comes
the
fighting
and
again
with
the
flopping
and
the
gasping
'cause
hey
chicken
of
the
sea
here's
not
doing
too
good
with
the
women
these
days
huh
sorry
i'm
just
looking

the
daddy
thing

'cause
incest
not
that
sexy
aw
crap
so
uh
why

we
leave
the

to
their
impending
nausea
and
move
the
freakshow
outside
whaddaya
say
okay
but
lemme
ask
you
something
first
you
think
maybe
you
could
put
in
a
word
for
me
with
that
anya
chick
'cause
if
she's
taking
it
from
a
vamp

i
think
i
might
have
a
chance

no
wonder
she's
screwing
a
dead
guy
you
hit
like
a
girl
well
at
least
i
know
how
to
get
one
let's
see
how
popular
you
are
without
a
face
warren
we
have
to
go
we
go
when
i'm
ready
hey
it's
your
call
but

we're
gonna
miss
that
thing
you
wanted
to
do
tonight
if
we
don't

now
that's
all
i'm
saying
it's
your
lucky
night

just
gonna
leave
him
there
what
if
he
sics
the
slayer
on
us

found
warren
this
what
you

not
seeing
spike
anymore

he
hurt
you
he
tried
he
didn't
son
of
a
bitch

hey
i
think
we
finally
have
something
what
happened
nothing
what'd
you
find
out
we
were
able
to
decipher
pretty
much
everything
except
these
it
isn't
written
in
any
ancient
language
we
could
identify
it's
klingon
they're
love
poems
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
insidious
scheme
you're
about
to
describe
what
do
you
got
for
me
that
doesn't
rhyme
um
this
it
was
filled
with
encoded
blueprints
and
schematics
to
what
um
banks
armored
car
routes
corporate
vaults
this
is
big
they're
looking
to
score
some
serious
dinero
we
don't
think
they're
planning
just
one
job
spree
anyone
i
i
can't
cover
all
of
these
at
once
you
don't
have
to
we
think
there's
one
they
may
hit
tonight
it's
time
sensitive
be
careful
warren's
gone
all
mighty
mouse
emphasis
on
the
might
good
then
i
won't
have
to
hold
back
i'm
gonna
make
you
feel
it
uh
knock
knock
i
was
just
in
the
neighborhood
so
i
thought
you
know
there's
a
nightrider
marathon
on
the
tv
so
uh
i
got
hot
wings
what

i
done

do
it
what
has
she
done
to
me
she
done
who
ohh

slayer
huh
gosh
she
break
up
with
you
again
we
were
never
together
not
really
she'd
never
lower
herself
that
far
she's
a
sweet
girl
spike
but
hey
whew
issues
and
no
wonder
with
the
whole
coming
back
from
the
grave
and
whatnot
hey
i
had
this
cousin
who
got
resurrected
by
some
kooky
shaman
whooboy
was
that
a
mess
why
do
i
feel
this
way
love's
a
funny
thing
is
that
what
this
is
i
can
feel
it
squirming
in
my
head
love
the
chip
gnawing
bits
and
chunks
uhh
maybe
a
wet
cloth
you
know
everything
used
to
be
so
clear
slayer
vampire
vampire
kills
slayer
sucks
her
dry
picks
his
teeth
with
her
bones
it's
always
been
that
way
i've
tasted
the
life
of
two
slayers
but
with
buffy
it
isn't
supposed
to
be
this
way
it's
the
chip
steel
and
wires
and
silicon
it
won't
let
me
be
a
monster
and
i
can't
be
a
man
i'm
nothing
hey
come
on
now
mr
negative
you
never
know
what's
just
around
the
corner
things
change
yeah
they
do
if
you
make
them
all
right
that's
the
last
one
always
the
biggest
gate
of
the
year
yeah
don't
lose
any
yeah
wanna
grab
a
bite
after
i
think
ruby's
is
still
open
what
the
hell
there's
something
back
there
man
i
can't
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
his
orbs
yeah
i'm
sure
he'll
be
giving
'em
up
any
second
now
hey
is
this
your
bank
'cause
if
not
there's
gonna
be
a
fee
for
that
i
was
wondering
when
super
bitch
would
show
up
you
really
got
a
problem
with
strong
women
don't
you
nothing
i
can't
handle
it's
getting
better
that
all
you
got
no
there's
two
ways
this
can
end
and
right
now
i'm
thinking
they're
both
gonna
hurt
i
think
you're
right
what's
the
matter
baby
you
never
fight
a
real
man
before
wow
that
almost
hurt
kitten
kill
her
kill
her
you
know
who
i
am
huh
slayer
you're
a
murderer
well
that
too
but
more
to
the
point
and
it's
not
the
muscles
baby
it's
the
brains
i'll
remember
that
when
i
knock
'em
clean
out
of
your
whoa
sparky
i
didn't
think
you
had
it
in
you
the
orbs
smash
his
orbs
say
good
night
bitch
good
night
bitch
you're
nothing
but
a
sad
little
boy
warren
but
it's
time
you
grow
up
and
pay
for
what
you've
done
get
away
from
me
oh

he
wouldn't
just
