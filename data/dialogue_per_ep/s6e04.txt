meet
at
last
mister
drippy
want
me
to
call
a
plumber
no
you
sure
yes
got
the
number
dawn
i'm
on
it
okay
ah
there
all
better
man
how
much
water
can
they
fit
in
one
set
of
pipes
if
i
understand
right
the
entire
city
water
supply
it's
like
little
clown
cars
in
the
circus
told
you
we
should
have
called
the
plumber
you
were
right
the
plumber
will
make
everything
good
dawnie
you're
not
eating
breakfast
dawn
breakfast
is
the
most
important
meal
of
the
day
it's
unbelievably
important
you
should
eat
breakfast
at
least
three
times
a
day
i'll
um
grab
something
before
school
and
a
big
sunnydale
round
of
applause
for
tito
the
amazing
plumber
extraordinaire
so
how's
everything
looking
down
there
like
we
should
start
gathering
up
two
of
every
animal
basically
your
pipes
are
shot
i
mean
the
whole
system's
gonna
have
to
be
replaced
what
you
need
is
a
full
copper
repipe
job
full
copper
repipe
that
sounds
potentially
pricey
well
if
you
have
any
questions
our
number's
on
the
invoice
that's
a
weird
phone
number
oh
wait
is
that
the
bill
hey
tito
cut
you
a
good
deal
down
there
those
are
his
bargain
prices
i
did
a
little
haggling
for
you
thank
you
so
we'll
pay
him
what's
the
big
deal
um
buffy
ii
know
you're
still
getting
back
on
your
feet
after
lying
flat
on
my
back
yeah
uh
but
there's
some
money
stuff
we're
gonna
have
to
talk
to
you
about
okay
so
you're
telling
me
i'm
broke
not
yet
but

money's
definitely
becoming
an
issue
as
in
your
being
almost
out
of
it
but
i
haven't
spent
any
money
i
was
all
dead
and
frugal
ii
know
this
comes
as
a
bit
of
a
shock
after
a
bit
of
a
shock
but
it
took
us
by
surprise
too
your
mother
prepared
everything
really
well
she
had
insurance

life
insurance
which
should
have
left
you
covered
but
hospital
bills
pretty
much
sucked
up
all
the
money
which
you're
still
hemorrhaging
by
the
way
how
am
i
doing
that
no
not
you
the
house
uh
see
this
house
just
sitting
here
doing
nothing
um
by
itself
costs
money
so
what
do
we
do
easy
we
burn
the
house
to
the
ground
and
collect
the
insurance
plus
fire
pretty
you
guys
i'm
kidding
okay
it's
it's
bills
it's
money
it's
pieces
of
paper
sent
by
bureaucrats
that
we've
never
even
met
it's
not
like
it's
the
end
of
the
world
which
is
too
bad
you
know
'cause
that
i'm
really
good
at
i'll
take
care
of
this
i
promise
i
just
don't
know
how
yet
i
know
how
um
iiif
you
wanna
pay
every
bill
here
and
every
bill
coming
and
have
enough
to
start
a
nice
college
fund
for
dawn
start
charging
for
what
slaying
vampires
well
you're
providing
a
valuable
service
to
the
whole
community
i
say
cash
in
well
that's
an
idea
you
would
have
any
other
suggestions
well
i
mean
it's
it's
not
so
crazy
yes
it
is
you
can't
charge
innocent
people
for
saving
their
lives
spiderman
does
he
does
not
does
too
does
no
xander
action
is
his
reward
why
don't
you
ever
take
my
side
what
are
you
talking
about
taking
your
side
anya
i
am
your
side
you're
throwin'
away
a
gold
mine
come
on
wait
up
anya
what's
wrong
with
you
why
don't
you
ask
your
best
friend
spiderman
you
know
if
you're
not
going
to
support
me
i'm
supportive
i'm
totally
supportive
i'm
a
flying
buttress
of
support
no
you're
not
this
is
because
i
haven't
told
them
yet
about
the
engagement
isn't
it
no
maybe
yes
it's
painful
and
confusing
i
mean
first
you
you
give
me
this
beautiful
ring
and
then
i
can't
even
wear
it
in
public
i
mean
do
you
know
how
depressing
that
is
anya
i
promise
your
waiting
days
are
almost
over
i
i
know
it's
frustrating
but
the
way
i
understand
this
marriage
thing
it's
kind
of
a
forever
deal
not
if
you
never
get
started
i
mean
don't
you
want
to
get
married
yes
so
then
why
won't
you
tell
them
because
i'm
still
getting
used
to
the
miracle
of
a
steady
paycheck
and
getting
out
of
my
parents'
house
and
this
this
husband
thing
it's
a
big
step
or
a
lot
of
little
ones
and
and
i
love
you
so
much
i
just
want
every
step
to
be
just
right
really
hey
you
tricked
me
just
now
wwith
your
fancy
talk
and
and
lips
you
keep
doing
this
and
i
keep
forgetting
and
you
keep
stalling
anya
when
are
you
going
to
grow
up
xander
there's
a
first
time
for
everything
is
my
philosophy
this
is
my
first
big
loan
stupid
skirt
hello
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting
carl
savitsky
loan
officer
buffy
summers
loan
applierfor
i
i
didn't
know
exactly
what
you
would
need
so
um
i
brought
everything
i'm
very
responsible
in
that
way
okay
i
don't
think
i'll
need
this
or
these
old
report
cards
definitely
not
so
about
my
getting
a
loan
yes
well
uh
it
looks
as
if
financially
uh
we
have
a
bit
of
a
tangle
i
know
and
i
figured
you
could
just
you
know
cut
through
that
tangle
with
scissors
you
know
where
the
loan
is
the
scissors
ms
summers
the
only
collateral
you
have
is
your
house
which
was
never
fully
leveraged
and
has
been
losing
equity
over
the
last
several
years
for
some
reason
sunnydale
property
values
have
never
been
competitive
and
refinancing's
out
of
the
question
are
you
saying
you
won't
give
me
my
loan
well
the
problem
is
you
have
no
income
no
job
no
job
i
wish
hey
are
you
in
the
wrong
line
that's
for
deposits
that's
for
withdrawals
and
this
one
is
for
getting
kicked
in
the
face
stupid
skirt
may
i
put
the
girl
down
these
things
never
helpful
now
about
my
loan
i'm
not
saying
i'm
charging
you
for
saving
your
life
or
anything
but
let's
talk
rates
he
still
turned
you
down
that's
crazy
i
mean
even
if
the
bank
did
get
robbed
which
you
battling
demons
couldn't
possibly
know
you
would
think
there
would
be
some
kind
of
reward
but
no
they're
like
oh
we're
not
gonna
give
you
money
unless
you
prove
you
don't
need
it
i
mean
what
kind
of
system
is
that
you're
asking
the
wrong
gal
hey
buffy
you're
mad
you
noticed
it'll
pass
no
anger
is
a
big
powerful
emotion
you
should
feel
well
that's
good
then
it's
gone
now
okay
uh
let
me
make
you
mad
again
uh
ready
um

last
semester
i
slept
with
riley
and
you
know
i
really
doubt
it
caught
me
big
fib
to
cover
up
the
sleazy
affair
i
had
with
angel
will
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
pissing
you
off
yes
true
why
well
'cause
you
know
since
you've
been
back
you
haven't
exactly
been
big
with
the
whole
range
of
human
emotions
thing
what
do
you
mean
well
you
haven't
no
i
mean
it's
just
um

you
know
this
is
really
my
problem
i'm
just
i'm
all
over
the
place
and
you
should
just
uh
forget
i
even
said
anything
cause
cause
well
'cause
you
know
banks
man
don't
be
such
a
wiener
dog
look
at
them
researching
demons
for
the
billionth
time
they
could
use
a
peppy
boost
of
happy
news
you're
right
i'll
tell
them
as
soon
as
buffy
and
willow
come
in
chicken
would
you
stop
dare
you
anya
if
i
tell
them
we're
engaged
right
after
you
dared
me
to
wouldn't
you
always
wonder
if
that's
the
only
reason
i
did
it
oh
score
one
for
captain
logic
no
no
captain
logic
is
not
steering
this
tugboat
i
smell
captain
fear
at
the
wheel
god
i
hate
this
this
tone
in
my
voice
i
dislike
it
more
than
you
do
and
i'm
closer
to
it
oh
come
on
tara
i
am
so
old
enough
to
do
research
do
you
really
think
i'm
not
mature
enough
i
think
you're
very
mature
for
your
age
but
you're
still
only
fifteen
right
fifteen
as
in
teenager
you
know
if
you
don't
let
me
look
at
the
pictures
i'm
gonna
learn
everything
i
know
about
demons
on
the
street
knock
yourself
out
thank
you
see
no
biggie
i
can
totally
handle
it
that's
a
weird
place
for
a
horn
that's
not
a
horn
you
know
i
still
don't
get
it
i
mean
what
kind
of
a
demon
would
rob
a
bank
the
kind
that
wants
money
what
do
you
even
call
that
this
i'm
guessing
on
how
you
say
it
it's
got
an
apostrophe
i
think
it's
mmmfashnik
like
mmm
cookies
or
maybe
muhfashnik
like
muh
fashnik
this
your
guy
you
do
research
now
want
a
cappuccino
and
a
pack
of
cigarettes
to
go
with
it
would
you
just
look
at
the
picture
doesn't
exactly
fit
the
profile
for
your
typical
bank
robber
maybe
they
turned
down
his
loan
application
that's
him
big
bad
this
thing
was
strong
guys
no
weapons
that
i
could
see
but

still
real
dangerous
oh
god
buffy
you're
alive
you're
here
and
you're
still

remarkably
strong
huh
oh
sorry
willow
told
me
but
i
didn't
really
let
myself
believe

i
take
a
little
getting
used
to
i'm
still
getting
used
to
me
it's
uh
you're

a
miracle
yes
but
then
i
always
thought
so
so

i
can
start
how
was
england
how
was
life
uh
i'm
not
really
sure
how
to
answer
that
um
well
i
arrived
home
i
uh
met
with
the
council
always
a
good
time
yes
otherwise
there's
uh
nothing
really
to
report
i
um
i
keep
a
flat
in
bath
i
i
uh
met
with
a
few
old
friends
almost
made
a
new
one
which
i
think
is
statistically
impossible
for
a
man
of
my
age
and
now
you're
back
yes
wow
giles
are
you
miserable
about
it
or
just
really
british
i
can't
lie
to
you
buffy
um
leaving
sunnydale
was
uh
was
difficult
and
uh
coming
back
was
i'm
guessing
the
word
is
inconvenient
no
bewildering
and
how
are
you
really
you
look
tired
me
nah
fine
i
mean
yeah
you
know
sleeping's
hard
but
just
because
of
the
whole
waking
up
in
a
box
thing
so
maybe
waking
up's
the
problem
you
know
but
just
for
a
second
i
sleep
okay
great
even
except
you
know
for
the
dreams

you
seem
to
be
doing
remarkably
well
under
extreme
circumstances
i'm
proud
of
you
well
actually
it
wasn't
me
willow
brought
me
back
i
just
lay
there
youyou
know
i
meant

i
know
what
you
meant
it
was
just
a
little
postpostmortem
comedy
well
i
i
uh
better
start
prepping
the
slayage
yes
there
is
always
that
isn't
there
seems
that
way
giles
we're
so
glad
to
see
you
we
missed
you
you
can't
have
the
store
back
i
know
you
signed
papers
i
did
and
do
we
have
information
on
this
new
demon
that
i
suddenly
find
so
desperately
interesting
that
we
do
this
one
robs
banks
oh
i
found
him
m'fashnik
oh
aha
like
mmm
cookies
uh
no
quite
different
actually
you
know
it
by
reputation
yes
they
they
come
from
a
long
line
of
mercenary
demons
that
perform
acts
of
slaughter
and
mayhem
for
the
highest
bidder
well
it
is
the
american
way
yes
but
uh
the
question
now
becomes
what's
out
there
powerful
enough
to
control
one
of
these
things
we
had
a
deal
you
got
what
you
wanted
now
give
me
what
i
want
the
head
of
the
slayer
okay
sure
we
can
do
that
you
hired
me
to
create
chaos
and
carnage
for
you
told
me
you
were
powerful
men
commanding
machines
magicks
the
demon
realms
below
we
are
yuhhuh

of
you

can't
pay
me
with
paper
tiny
king
you
pitted
me
against
the
slayer
for
that
i
must
kill
you
then
i
will
suck
dry
your
bones
and
use
them
to
beat
your
subjects
to
death

school

one
dead
slayer
coming

just
give
us
a
minute
for
what
well
we
just
really
wanna
nail
down
the
optimum
method
for
us
to
wipe
out
the
slayer
for
you
make
sure
it
involves
pain
i
know
they're
so
cute
you
could
die
but
it's
all
i
got
think
nothing
of
it
it's
it's
uh
whimsical
they
were
mine
when
i
was
little
couldn't
find
the
guest
sheets
mom
always
did
this
stuff
they
don't
actually
fit
i
blame
the
sofa
we
need
one
of
those
pullout
kinds
the
kind
with
no
payments
'til
twothousandandinfinity
what
oh
it's
just
money
stuff
it
turns
out
mom
left
me
some
and
while
i
was
dead
it
got
squandered
on
luxuries
like
food
and
clothing
how
bad
is
it
anya
says
pretty
bad
i'm
kinda
taking
her
word
for
it
actually
i'm
kinda
trying
to
not
think
about
it
sound
policy
at
least
for
tonight
figured
i'd
put
it
out
of
my
mind
you
know
take
a
break
get
some
perspective
and
then
wake
up
at
four
am
terrified
buffy
perhaps
you're
putting
too
much
pressure
on
yourself
i
mean
to
return
from
some
unknown
level
of
hell
it's
only
natural
that
coming
back
will
be
a
process
in
the
meantime
i'm
scaring
people
well
that
can
take
time
too
well
if
it's
any
consolation
life
can
be
pretty
overwhelming
even
for
people
who
haven't
been
where
you
have
i
guess
look
tomorrow
morning
you
and
i
will
sit
down
together
and
we'll
go
through
everything
every
bill
one
by
one
we'll
work
it
out
together
i'm
glad
you're
back
well
i'm
glad
you
are
too
are
we
really
gonna
kill
her
that's
so
sad
shut
up
whineathan
but
i
i
don't
want
to
kill
buffy
either
yeah
she
saved
my
life
a
bunch
of
times
plus
she's
hot
it's
her
or
us
i
mean
we
have
to
do
it
we're
talking
about
murder
no
we're
talking
about
staying
alive
and
since
this
is
my
mom's
house
i
think
what
i
say
goes
but
aside
from
the
moral
issues
and
the
mess
we
can
get
in
trouble
for
murder
duh
you
know
the
last
i
checked
the
authorities
also
frowned
on
bank
robbery
too
genius
i
don't
even
know
if
we
could
kill
buffy
she's
got
superstrength
and
you
know
killing
people
this
is
not
why
we
got
together
in
the
first
place
yeah
we
teamed
up
with
one
clear
supercool
mission
statement
remember
so
you
guys
wanna
team
up
and
take
over
sunnydale
okay
of
course
i
remember
it
was
last
month
then
you
know
we
have
a
mission
shrink
rays
trained
gorillas
workable
prototype
jetpacks
and
chicks
chicks
chicks
i
know
that's
the
action
i
signed
on
for
me
too
ixnay
on
the
urdermay
vote
okay
who's
for
not
killing
buffy
agreed
so
what
are
we
gonna
do
about
this
mm'fashnik
guy
ah
wait
here
okay
i
got
an
idea
here's
the
slayer's
name
address
and
telephone
number
you
wanna
kill
her
make
it
so
how'd
you
make
him
do
that
what
are
you
some
kind
of
jedi
the
force
can
sometimes
have
great
power
on
the
weakminded
hey
giles
you
have
a
good
talk
with
buffy
yes
now
that
she's
back
isn't
it
awesome
mmm
tell
me
about
this
spell
you
performed
oh
okay
first
of
all
so
scary
like
the
blair
witch
would
have
had
to
watch
like
this
and
and
and
this
giant
snake
came
out
my
mouth
and
there
was
all
this
energy
crackling
and
this
pack
of
demons
interrupted
but
i
totally
kept
it
together
and
then
the
next
thing
you
know
buffy
you're
a
very
stupid
girl
what
giles
do
you
have
any
idea
what
you've
done
the
forces
you've
harnessed
the
lines
you've
crossed
i
thought
you'd
be
impressed
or
or
something
oh
don't
worry
you've
made
a
very
deep
impression
of
everyone
here
you
were
the
one
i
trusted
most
to
respect
the
forces
of
nature
are
you
saying
you
don't
trust
me
think
what
you've
done
to
buffy
i
brought
her
back
at
incredible
risk
risk
of
what
making
her
deader
of
killing
us
all
unleashing
hell
on
earth
i
mean
shall
i
go
on
no
giles
i
did
what
i
had
to
do
i
did
what
nobody
else
could
do
oh
there
are
others
in
this
world
who
can
do
what
you
did
you
just
don't
want
to
meet
them
no
probably
not
but
well
they're
the
bad
guys
i'm
not
a
bad
guy
i
brought
buffy
back
into
this
world
aand
maybe
the
word
you
should
be
looking
for
is
congratulations
having
buffy
back
in
the
world
makes
me
feel
indescribably
wonderful
but
i
wouldn't
congratulate
you
if
you
jumped
off
a
cliff
and
happened
to
survive
that's
not
what
i
did
giles
you
were
lucky
i
wasn't
lucky
i
was
amazing
and
how
would
you
know
you
weren't
even
there
if
i
had
been
i'd
have
bloody
well
stopped
you
the
magicks
you
channeled
are
more
ferocious
and
primal
than
anything
you
can
hope
to
understand
and
you
are
lucky
to
be
alive
you
rank
arrogant
amateur
you're
right
the
magicks
i
used
are
very
powerful
i'm
very
powerful
and
maybe
it's
not
such
a
good
idea
for
you
to
piss
me
off
come
on
giles
ii
don't
want
to
fight
i
let's
not
okay
i'll
think
about
what
you
said
and
you
try
to
be
happy
buffy's
back
we
still
don't
know
where
she
was
or
what
happened
to
her
and
i'm
far
from
convinced
she's
come
out
of
all
this
undamaged
hello
spike
you
hear
all
that
noise
just
enough
to
make
me
feel
crappy
you
know
watcherboy
doesn't
mean
anything
by
it
i
guess
everyone

they
all
care
they
all
care
so
much
it
makes
it
all
harder
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
you
around
that
bend
luv
i
don't
know
i
just
i
feel
like
i'm
spending
all
of
my
time
trying
to
be
okay
so
they
don't
worry
it's
exhausting
and
then
i
and
that
makes
'em
worry
even
more
you
want
me
to
take
them
out
give
me
a
hell
of
a
headache
but
i
could
probably
thin
the
herd
a
little
knew
i
could
get
a
grin
why
are
you
always
around
when
i'm
miserable
'cause
that's
when
you're
alone
i
reckon
i'm
not
one
for
crowds
myself
these
days
me
neither
that
works
out
nicely
then
so
what
do
you
know
about
finances
dawn
couldn't
sleep
not
really
you
evidently
not
you
ever
try
mixing
parts
of
every
cereal
you
got
in
one
bowl
does
it
work
gonna
find
out
wanna
come
join
the
experiment
i'm
an
ideal
control
group
i
find
as
you
get
older
that
you
lose
patience
with
throwing
up
is
that
locked
it
should
be
you're
not
the
slayer
but
you'll
do
for
a
start
you're
payin'
for
that
door
buddy
ooh
table
you
have
cost
me
slayer
i
cost
you
that's
a
designer
lamp
ya
mook
spike
no
i
want
him
in
the
kitchen
open
the
door
the
basement
i'm
taking
him
down
no
full
copper
repipe
no
more
full
copper
repipe
whoa
did
you
know
this
place
was
flooded
i
think
we
have
a
lot
to
feel
good
about
we
got
the
money
we
got
the
lair
and
our
one
loose
end
has
been
taken
care
of

by
the
slayer
flamethrower's
up
periscope's
working
it
looks
like
your
mom's
weeding
tulips
again
action
figures
fully
deployed
i
still
can't
believe
it
we
did
it
we
can
do
anything
we
could
stay
up
all
night
if
we
wanna
whoa
whoa
whoa
don't
get
all
crazy
on
us
andrew
i
was
only
saying
what
are
we
gonna
do
about
buffy
you
know
sooner
or
later
the
slayer's
gotta
come
after
us
bring
her
on
we
could
uh
we
could
hypnotize
her
make
her
our
willing
sex
bunny
i'm
putting
that
on
the
list
is
this
the
life
or
what
mm
i
mean
here
we
got
all
the
stuff
we
ever
wanted
and
we
didn't
even
have
to
earn
it
exactamundo
it's
true
my
friends
the
way
i
see
it
life
is
like
an
interstellar
journey
some
people
go
into
hypersleep
and
travel
at
sublight
speeds
only
to
get
where
they're
going
after
years
of
struggle
toil
and
hard
hard
work
we
on
the
other
hand

blast
through
the
spacetime
continuum
in
a
wormhole
gentlemen
crime
is
our
wormhole
but
everyone
knows
if
the
width
of
a
wormhole
cavity
is
a
whole
number
of
wavelengths
plus
a
fraction
of
that
wavelength
the
coinciding
particle
activity
collapses
the
infrastructure
dude
don't
be
a
geek
this
is
going
to
take
forever
isn't
it
not
forever
just
a
very
long
time
uh
here
it
is
your
first
approximation
of
your
spanking
new
debt
i've
trashed
this
house
so
many
times
how
did
mom
pay
for
this
for
starters
she
saved
money
with
this
crappyass
coffee
table
well
there's
always
that
charging
option
no
i
will
definitely
probably
not
be
doing
that
well
i
know
i'm
back
in
america

i've
been
knocked
unconscious
thank
you
aw
poor
lumpy

anyway
i
mean
aside
from
costing
you
a
bundle

he's
way
too
dead
to
answer
that
question
wish
i
knew
who
hired
him

could
do
a
locator
spell
or

superpowers

you
