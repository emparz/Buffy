examined
it
you
can
uh
uh
skim
it
scan
it
rupert
that's
scan
it
of
course
oh
i
know
our
ways
are
strange
to
you
but
soon
you
will
join
us
in
the
20th
century
with
three
whole
years
to
spare
ms
calendar
i'm
sure
your
computer
science
class
is
fascinating
but
i
happen
to
believe
that
one
can
survive
in
modern
society
without
being
a
slave
to
the
um
idiot
box
that's
tv
the
idiot
box
is
tv
this
is
the
good
box
i
still
prefer
a
good
book
the
printed
page
is
obsolete
information
isn't
bound
up
anymore
it's
an
entity
the
only
reality
is
virtual
if
you're
not
jacked
in
you're
not
alive
thank
you
fritz
for
making
us
all
sound
like
crazy
people
fritz
fritz
comes
on
a
little
strong
but
he
does
have
a
point
you
know
for
the
last
two
years
more
email
was
sent
than
regular
mail
oh
more
digitized
information
went
across
phone
lines
than
conversation
that
is
a
fact
that
i
regard
with
genuine
horror
i'll
bet
it
is
alright
guys
let's
wrap
it
up
for
today
i've
just
got
a
few
more
i'll
hang
for
a
bit
cool

oh
buffy

was
up
last
night
i
tried
your
line
like
a
million
times
oh
i
was
i
was
talking
talking
to
okay
that's
it
you
have
a
secret
and
that's
not
allowed
why
not
'cause
there's
a
rule
well
i
sort
of
met
someone
i
knew
it
this
is
so
important
when
did
you
meet
last
week
after
we
did
the
scanning
project
in
the
library
does
he
go
here
what's
his
name
have
you
kissed
him
what's
he
like
no
malcolm
no
and
very
nice
you
are
a
thing
of
evil
for
not
telling
me
this
right
away
well
i
wasn't
sure
there
was
anything
to
tell
but
last
night
oh
we
talked
all
night
it
was
amazing
he's
so
smart
buffy
and
and
he's
romantic
and
we
agree
about
everything
what's
he
look
like
i
don't
know
yes
i
will
i
promise
so
you've
been
seeing
a
guy
and
you
don't
know
what
he
looks
like
okay
this
is
a
puzzle
no
wait
i'm
good
at
these
does
it
involve
a
midget
and
a
block
of
ice
i
met
him
online
on
line
for
what
oh
morning
kids
buffy
are
you
supposed
to
be
somewhere
no
i
have
a
free
cool
but
this
is
lab
time
so
let's
make
it
a
nice
short
visit
okay
sure
you
have
mail
it's
him
i'm
thinking
of
you
he's
so
sweet
he's
a
sweetie
what
should
i
write
back
uh
willow
i
think
it's
really
great
that
you
have
this
cool
pen
pal
but
don't
you
think
you're
kinda
rushing
all
into
this
y'know
what
i
mean
'i'm
thinking
of
you
too'
no
that's
incredibly
stupid
will
down
girl
let's
focus
here
okay
what
do
you
actually
know
about
this
guy
oh
see
i
knew
you'd
react
like
this
like
what
i
just
wanna
make
sure
you're
careful
that's
all
buffy
he
could
be
different
than
you
think
watch
her
his
name
is
malcolm
black
he's
eighteen
he
lives
in
elmwood
which
is
about
eighty
miles
from
here
and
he
likes
me
short
tall
skinny
fat
why
does
everything
have
to
be
about
looks
not
everything
but
some
stuff
is
i
mean
what
if
you
guys
get
really
really
intense
and
then
you
find
out
that
he
has
a
hairy
back
well
no
uh
he
doesn't
talk
like
somebody
who
would
have
a
hairy
back
and
anyways
that
stuff
doesn't
matter
when
you
really
care
about
each
other
maybe
i'm
not
his
ideal
either
hey
i'm
just
trying
to
make
sure
that
he's
good
enough
for
you
i
think
it's
great
that
you
met
someone
hey
fritz
i'm
uh
lookin'
at
the
logs
you
and
dave
are
clockin'
a
pretty
scary
amount
of
computer
time
new
project
ooo
will
i
be
excited
you'll
die
this
isn't
my
report
'nazi
germany
was
a
model
of
a
wellordered
society'
i
didn't
write
that
who's
been
in
my
files
hup
guess
who
uh
xander
yeah
but
keep
guessing
anyway
xander

i
can't
fool
ya
you
see
right
through
my
petty
charade
we
goin'
to
the
bronze
tonight

think
i'm
gonna
call
it
an
early
night
oh
malcolm

heard
but
you're
gonna
be
missin'
out
i'm
plannin'
to
be
witty

gonna
make
fun
of
all
the
people
who
won't
talk
to
me
that's
nice
have
a
good
time
she
certainly
looks
perky
yeah
color
in
the
cheeks
bounce
in
the
step
i
don't
like
it
it's
not
healthy
so
are
you
goin'
to
the
bronze
tonight
oh
probably
not
you
probably
have
some
vampire
slaying
or
some
lame
endeavor
like
that
don't
you
everyone
deserts
me
check
out
the
jealous
man
what
are
you
talking
about
you're
jealous
of
what
willow's
got
a
thang
and
xander's
left
hanging
oh
that's
meaningless
drivel
i'm
not
interested
in
willow
like
that
yeah
but
you
got
used
to
being
the
belle
of
the
ball
no
it's
just
this
malcolm
guy
what's
his
deal
i
mean
tell
me
you're
not
slightly
wigged
okay
slightly
i
mean
just
not
knowing
what
he's
really
like
or
who
he
really
is
i
mean
sure
he
says
he's
a
high
school
student
but
i
can
say
i'm
a
high
school
student
you
are
okay
but
i
can
also
say
that
i'm
an
elderly
dutch
woman
get
me
i
mean
who's
to
say
i'm
not
if
i'm
in
the
elderly
dutch
chat
room
i
get
your
point
i
get
your
point
oh
this
guy
could
be
anybody
he
could
be
weird
or
crazy
or
old
or
he
could
be
a
circus
freak
he's
probably
a
circus
freak
yeah
i
mean
we
read
about
it
all
the
time
y'know
people
meet
on
the
'net
they
talk
they
get
together
have
dinner
a
show
horrible
ax
murder
willow
ax
murdered
by
a
circus
freak
okay
okay
what
do
we
do
what
are
we
doing
xander
you
get
me
started
we
are
totally
overreacting
but
it's
fun
isn't
it
i'm
jacked
in
i'm
jacked
in
i'm
jacked
in
i'm
jacked
in
whoa
you're
the
late
girl
i
overslept
till
fifth
period
talkin'
to
malcolm
last
night
yeah
what
nothing
you're
having
an
expression
i'm
not
but
if
i
was
it'd
be
saying
'this
just
isn't
like
you'
willow
not
like
me
to
have
a
boyfriend
he's
boyfriendly
i
don't
understand
why
you
don't
want
me
to
have
this
i
mean
boys
don't
chase
me
around
all
the
time
i
thought
you'd
be
happy
for
me
i
just
want
you
to
be
sure
to
meet
him
face
to
face
in
daylight
in
a
crowded
place
with
some
friends
y'know
before
you
become
all
obsessive
malcolm
and
i
really
care
about
each
other
big
deal
if
i
blow
off
a
couple
classes
i
thought
you
said
you
overslept
malcolm
said
you
wouldn't
understand
malcolm
was
right
dave
hey
there
dave
anybody
home
oh
what
do
you
want
i
wanted
to
ask
you
something
if
you
have
a
minute
what
is
it
well
you're
a
computer
geek
genius
and
uh
i
sort
of
have
a
technical
problem
if
i
wanted
to
find
out
something
about
someone
i
if
someone
emailed
me
could
i
trace
the
letter
well
you
could
pull
up
somebody's
profile
based
on
their
user
name
but
they
write
the
profile
themselves
right
and
so
they
could
say
anything
they
wanted
true
wow
i
had
knowledge
well
is
there
a
way
to
find
out
exactly
where
a
letter
an
eletter
came
from
i
mean
the
actual
location
of
the
computer
that's
a
challenge
'cause
you
see
willow's
got
this
boyfriend
malcolm
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
leave
willow
alone
what
do
you
mean
that's
none
of
your
business
dave
are
you
malcolm
of
course
not
dave
what's
going
on
look
i'll
talk
to
you
later
okay
i've
got
work
to
do
so
do
i
i'm
telling
you
something
is
going
on
it's
not
just
willow
those
boys
aren't
sparklingly
normal
as
it
is
giles
trust
me
ii
do
iii
really
don't
know
how
to
advise
you
things
involved
with
a
computer
fill
me
with
a
childlike
terror
now
if
it
were
a
nice
ogre
or
some
such
i'd
be
more
in
my
element
well
ii
suppose
you
could
um
tail
dave
see
if
he's
up
to
something
follow
dave
what
in
dark
glasses
and
a
trench
coat
please
i
can
work
this
out
myself
she's
too
close
what
do
i
do
kill
her
party
whatever
dave
is
into
it's
large
what
was
the
name
of
this
place
it
said
crd
but
i
couldn't
get
close
enough
to
see
what
it
was
calax
research
and
development
it's
a
computer
research
lab
thirdlargest
employer
in
sunnydale
till
it
closed
down
last
year
what
i
can't
have
information
sometimes
well
itit's
just
somewhat
unprecedented
well
my
uncle
used
to
work
there
iin
a
floor
sweeping
capacity
but
it
closed
uh
huh
looked
pretty
functional
from
where
i
stood
i
don't
have
a
clue
what
they
were
doing
and
what
do
they
need
dave
for
something
about
computers
right
i
mean
he
is
offthechart
smart
we
still
don't
know
an
enormous
amount
whatever
is
going
on
there
may
be
on
the
upandup
no
if
crd
opened
it
would've
been
on
the
news
besides
i
can
just
tell
something's
wrong
my
spider
sense
is
tingling
your
spider
sense
pop
culture
reference
sorry
yes
well
i
think
we're
still
at
a
stand
still
uh
uh
short
of
breaking
into
the
place
i
don't
see
breaking
in
then
this
is
the
plan
i'm
free
tonight
tonight
it
is
a
moment
please
of
quiet
reflection
i
do
not
suggest
that
you
illegally
enter
the
data
into
the
file
so
the
book
will
be
listed
by
title
as
well
as
by
author
i
just
came
by
to
check
your
new
data
base
make
sure
your
cross
reference
table
isn't
glitching
'cause
i'm
guessing
you
haven't
gone
anywhere
near
it
uh
i'm
still
sorting
through
the
chaos
you
left
behind
you
hmm
you're
here
again
kids
really
dig
the
library
don't
cha
we're
literary
to
read
makes
our
speaking
english
good
we'll
be
going
now
uh
wwe'll
uh
continue
this
conversation
at
another
time
i
think
we're
done
makes
our
speaking
english
is
good
i
panicked
okay
i've
never
felt
this
way
about
anyone
before
willow
i
know
what
you
mean
i
feel
like
you
know
me
better
than
anyone
i
do
do
you
think
we
should
meet
i
think
we
should
soon
i'm
nervous
i'm
not
isn't
that
strange
that's
what
buffy
doesn't
understand
how
comfortable
you
can
make
me
feel
buffy
just
makes
trouble
that's
why
she
got
kicked
out
of
her
old
school
how
did
you
know
that
it's
on
her
permanent
record
you
must
have
mentioned
it
i
guess
let's
not
worry
about
her
anymore
i
have
to
sign
off
i'll
talk
to
you
later
don't
bye
you're
a
snob
i
am
no
such
thing
oh
you
are
a
big
snob
you
you
think
that
knowledge
should
be
kept
in
these
carefully
guarded
repositories
where
only
a
handful
of
white
guys
can
get
at
it
nonsense
i
simply
don't
adhere
to
a
a
kneejerk
assumption
that
because
something
is
new
it's
better
this
isn't
a
fad
rupert
we
are
creating
a
new
society
here
a
society
in
which
human
interaction
is
all
but
obsolete
in
which
people
can
be
completely
manipulated
by
technology
well
well
thank
you
i'll
pass
well
i
think
you'll
be
very
happy
here
with
your
musty
old
books
these
musty
old
books
have
a
great
deal
more
to
say
than
in
any
of
your
fabulous
web
pages
hmm
this
one
doesn't
have
a
whole
lot
more
to
say
what
is
it
like
a
diary
how
odd
i
haven't
looked
through
all
the
volumes
yet
i
didn't
um
what
is
it
uh
nothing
um
a
a
diary
yes
i
imagine
that's
what
it
is
well
it's
been
so
nice
talking
to
you
we
were
fighting
must
do
it
again
sometime

his
file

allergic
to
penicillin

was
only
grounded
for
a
moment
still
if
you'd
been
anyone
but
the
slayer
tell
me
the
truth
how's
my
hair
it's
great
it's
your
best
hair
ever
uh
oh
yes
i
just
i
don't
understand
what
would
make
dave
do
a
thing
like
that
i
think
perhaps
i
do
does
this
look
familiar
to
either
of
you
yeah
sure
looks
like
a
book
i
knew
that
one
in
the
dark
ages
the
souls
of
demons
were
sometimes
trapped
in
certain
volumes
they
remained
locked
within
the
book
harmless
unless
the
pages
were
read
aloud
unless
i'm
mistaken
this
is
moloch
the
corrupter
a
very
deadly
and
seductive
demon
he
draws
people
to
him
with
promises
of
love
power
knowledge
preys
on
impressionable
minds
like
dave's
dave
and
who
knows
how
many
others
and
moloch
is
inside
that
book
not
anymore
you
released
moloch
way
to
go
i
didn't
read
it
that
dreadful
calendar
woman
found
it
and
and
it
was
already
blank
okay
so
a
powerful
demon
with
horns
is
walking
around
sunnydale
and
nobody's
noticed
iif
he's
so
big
and
strong
why
bother
with
dave
i
mean
why
didn't
he
just
attack
buffy
himself
i
don't
know
and
i
don't
know
who
could've
read
that
book
it
wasn't
even
in
english
where
was
it
uh
in
a
pile
with
others
that
were
um
uh
scanned
and
that
released
the
demon
no
he's
not
out
here
he's
in
there
the
scanner
read
the
book
it
brought
moloch
out
as
information
to
be
absorbed
he's
gone
binary
on
us
okay
for
those
of
us
in
our
studio
audience
who
are
me
you
guys
are
saying
that
moloch
is
in
this
computer
and
every
computer
connected
to
it
by
a
modem
he's
everywhere
what
are
we
gonna
do
willow
scanned
him
into
her
file
it
may
be
a
futile
gesture
but
i
suggest
we
um
uh
delete
it
solid
don't
get
too
close
okay
okay
so
which
file
do
you
think
it
is
willow
that's
probably
it
right
i'll
just
delete
the
whole
thing
stay
away
from
willow
it
is
none
of
your
business
so
that's
what
malcolm
looks
like
so
much
for
delete
file
this
is
very
bad
are
we
overreacting
he's
in
a
computer
what
can
he
do
you
mean
besides
convince
a
perfectly
nice
kid
to
try
and
kill
me
i
don't
know
how
about
mess
up
all
the
medical
equipment
in
the
world
randomize
traffic
signals
access
launch
codes
for
our
nuclear
missiles
destroy
the
world's
economy
i
think
i
pretty
much
capped
it
with
that
nuclear
missile
thing
right
yours
was
best
okay
he's
a
threat
i'm
on
board
with
that
now
but
what
can
we
do
about
it
i
think
the
first
thing
we
do
is
find
willow
she's
probably
talking
to
him
right
now
god
that
creeps
me
out
what
does
he
want
with
willow
let's
never
find
out
okay
i'm
gonna
check
the
computer
lab
and
you
guys
call
her
home
willow
no
answer
damn
it
well
it
wasn't
busy
either
so
she's
not
online
she's
not
home
what
did
you
find
willow
isn't
dave
he's
dead
how
well
it
looks
like
suicide
with
a
little
help
from
my
friends
i'd
guess
fritz
or
the
other
zomboids
from
crd
okay
you
and
i
are
gonna
go
to
willow's
house
giles
you
need
to
come
up
with
a
way
to
get
moloch
out
of
the
'net
i
i
have
records
of
the
ceremonies
but
but
that's
for
a
creature
of
the
flesh
ththis
could
be
something
completely
different
then
get
ms
calendar
maybe
she
can
help
you
well
even
if
she
could
how
am
i
gonna
convince
her
that
there's
a
demon
on
the
internet
okay
fine
then
you
can
stay
here
and
come
up
with
a
better
plan
c'mon
mom
dad
you
have
mail
no
more
waiting
i
need
you
to
see
me
you
have
mail
dad
did
you
forget
your
keys
again
no
more
waiting
a
spokesman
for
the
archbishop
denied
the
allegations
blaming
computer
error
for
the
apparent
financial
discrepancy
binding
rituals
in
washington
dc
the
fbi
today
reported
that
all
of
its
serial
killer
profiles
have
been
mysteriously
downloaded
from
its
central
computer
hi
i
got
your
message
what's
so
urgent
um
thank
you
for
coming
uh
i
need
your
help
but
before
that
um
i
need
you
to
believe
something
that
um
you
may
not
want
to
uh
there's
uh
something's
got
into
the
um
iiinside
um
there's
a
demon
in
the
internet
i
know
willow
this
isn't
good
willow
willow
okay
any
thoughts
'no
more
waiting
i
need
you
to
see
me'
see
him
how
where
what
about
crd
the
research
place
i'm
guessing
that's
moloch
central
guessing
that's
our
best
lead
let's
just
hope
giles
can
back
us
up
you
already
know
how
exactly
is
that
come
on
there've
been
portents
for
days
i
mean
power
surges
online
shutdowns
you
should
see
the
bones
i've
been
casting
i
knew
this
would
happen
sooner
or
later
i
mean
it's
probably
a
a
mischief
demon
y'know
like
kelkor
or
it's
moloch
the
corrupter
oh
boy
i
shoulda
remembered
i
just
don't
uh
you
don't
seem
exactly
surprised
by
who
are
you
i
teach
computer
science
at
the
local
high
school
a
profession
that
hardly
lends
itself
to
the
casting
of
bones
wrong
and
wrong
snobby
you
think
the
realm
of
the
mystical
is
limited
to
ancient
texts
and
relics
that
bad
old
science
made
the
magic
go
away
mm
the
divine
exists
in
cyberspace
same
as
out
here
are
you
a
witch
mm
i
don't
have
that
kinda
power
'technopagan'
is
the
term
there
are
more
of
us
than
you
think
well
uh
you
can
definitely
help
me
um
what's
in
cyberspace
at
the
moment
is
less
than
divine
i
have
the
binding
rituals
at
hand
but
i'm
completely
out
of
my
idiom
well
i
can
help
i
think
i
hope
i
mean
well
this
is
my
first
real
do
you
know
how
he
got
in
he
was
uh
'scanned'
is
the
term
i
believe
and
you
want
him
back
in
the
book
buffy
yeah
willow
not
at
home
it
looks
like
she
was
taken
somewhere
where
are
you
crd
whatever
moloch
wants
willow
for
it's
probably
in
there
ms
calendar
and
i
are
uh
working
to
get
moloch
offline
here's
a
tip
hurry
welcome
my
love
i
can't
tell
you
how
good
it
is
to
see
you
with
my
own
two
eyes
willow
malcolm
this
world
is
so
new
so
exciting
i
can
see
all
of
it
everything
flows
through
me
i
know
the
secrets
of
your
kings
but
nothing
compares
to
having
form
again
to
be
able
to
walk
to
touch
to
kill
back
way
back
way
here
they
come
the
first
thing
we
have
to
do
is
form
the
circle
of
kayless
right
form
a
circle
but
there's
only
two
of
us
that's
really
more
of
a
line
you're
not
getting
it
rupert
we
have
to
form
the
circle
inside
i'm
putting
out
a
flash
i
just
hope
enough
of
my
group
responds
won't
moloch
just
shut
you
down
well
i'm
betting
he
won't
figure
out
what
we're
doing
until
it's
too
late
hoping
and
betting
that's
what
we've
got
you
wanna
throw
in
praying
be
my
guest
i
don't
understand
what
do
you
want
from
me
i
want
to
give
you
the
world
why
you
created
me
i
brought
these
humans
together
to
build
me
a
body
but
you
gave
me
life
took
me
out
of
the
book
that
held
me
i
want
to
repay
you
by
lying
to
me
by
pretending
to
be
a
person
pretending
you
loved
me
i
do
uh
buffy
it's
her
yeah
who's
the
other
guy
don't
you
see
i
can
give
you
everything
i
can
control
the
world
right
now
a
man
in
beijing
is
transferring
money
to
a
swiss
bank
account
for
a
contract
on
his
mother's
life
good
for
him
i
can't
bust
it

heavy
steel
then
let's
find
another
way
in
what's
goin'
on
building's
security
system
is
computerized
whoops
almost
there
couldn't
you
just
stop
moloch
by
by
entering
some
computer
virus
you've
seen
way
too
many
movies
okay
we're
up
you
read
i
type
ready

am
by
the
power
of
the
divine

of
the
'net
he's

he's
not
in
the
book
he's
not
in
the
book
let's
go
this
way
wait
i
was
omnipotent
i
was
everything
now
i'm
trapped
in
this
shell
malcolm
remember
me
your
girlfriend
well
i
think
it's
time
we
break
up
or
maybe
we
can
still
be
friends
this
body's
all
i
have
left
but
it's
enough
to
crush
you
take
your
best
shot
well
look
who's
here
welcome
to
my
world
you
scared
i'm
remaining
calm
thank
you
uh
i
just
wanted
to
uh
return
this
i
found
it
among
the
new
books
and
naturally
i
thought
of
you
cool
thanks
uh
well
i'll
i'll
see
you
anon
can't
get
outta
here
fast
enough
can
you
truthfully
i'm
even
less
anxious
to
be
around
computers
than
i
used
to
be
well
it
was
your
book
that
started
all
the
trouble
not
a
computer
honestly
what
is
it
about
them
that
bothers
you
so
much
the
smell
computer's
don't
smell
rupert
i
know
smell
is
the
most
powerful
trigger
to
the
memory
there
is
a
certain
flower
or
a
a
whiff
of
smoke
can
bring
up
experiences
long
forgotten
books
smell
musty
and
and
and
and
rich
the
knowledge
gained
from
a
computer
is
uh
it
it
has
no
no
texture
no
no
context
it's
it's
there
and
then
it's
gone
if
it's
to
last
then
then
the
getting
of
knowledge
should
be
uh
tangible
it
should
be
um
smelly
well
you
really
are
an
oldfashioned
boy
aren't
you
well
ii
don't
dangle
a
corkscrew
from
my
ear

not
where
i
dangle
it

gonna
go
to
the
bronze

be
fun

remember
fun
that
thing
where

thinking
about
malcolm
malcolm
moloch
whatever
he's
called
the
one
boy
that's
really
liked
me
and
he's
a
demon
robot
what
does
that
say
about
me
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
you
i
mean
i
thought
i
was
really
falling
