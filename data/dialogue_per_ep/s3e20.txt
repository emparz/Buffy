what
do
i
have
funny
bed
hair
or
something
or
something
i
guess
we
got
a
little
carried
away
with
the
whole
postslayage
nap
thing
ohhh
not
good
where
you
going
to
go
kill
a
cat
on
my
head
no
mirrors
you
know
this
place
really
isn't
girlfriendly
no
mirrors
no
natural
light
i
think
you
look
perfect
oh
yeah
i
really
like
okay
maybe
we
should
think
about
getting
a
few
mirrors
and
maybe
a
drawer
you
know
for
some
of
my
stuff
because
that's
what
couples
do
they
have
drawers
mmmm
that's
right
you
know
ii
figure
that
way
sometimes
i
could
spend
the
night
like
after
the
prom
it
would
be
nice
to
be
able
to
just
come
back
here
and
spend
some
time
together
the
prom
end
of
high
school
rite
of
passage
thingy
think
cotillion
with
spiked
punch
and
electric
slide
right
oh
don't
worry
it's
at
night
and
lots
of
girls
have
older
girlfriends
you'll
blend
i
think
maybe
you
should
go
hunh
noo
must
be
a
few
more
hours
before
sunrise
ooh
sorry
i
guess
it's
later
than
we
thought
xander
well
hey
it's
demon
anya
punisher
of
evil
males
still
haven't
got
your
powers
back
you
haven't
right
no
i
will
though
it's
just
a
matter
of
time
so
now
how
did
that
work
women
would
wish
horrible
things
upon
their
exboyfriends
you'd
show
up
and
make
it
happen
that's
right
the
power
of
the
wish
made
me
a
righteous
sword
to
smite
the
unfaithful
well
hey
good
luck
with
that
hope
it
works
out
for
you
you
know
you
can
laugh
but
i
have
witnessed
a
millennium
of
treachery
and
oppression
from
the
males
of
the
species
and
i
have
nothing
but
contempt
for
the
whole
libidinous
lot
of
them
then
why
are
you
talking
to
me
i
don't
have
a
date
for
the
prom
well
gosh
i
wonder
why
not
it
couldn't
possibly
have
anything
to
do
with
your
sales
pitch
men
are
evil
will
you
go
with
me
one
of
us
is
very
confused
and
i
honestly
don't
know
which
you
know
this
happens
to
be
all
your
fault
my
fault
you
were
unfaithful
to
cordelia
so
i
took
on
the
guise
of
a
twelfthgrader
to
tempt
her
with
the
wish
when
i
lost
my
powers
i
got
stuck
in
this
persona
and
now
i
have
all
these
feelings
i
don't
understand
it
i
don't
like
it
all
i
know
is
i
really
want
to
go
to
this
dance
and
i
want
someone
to
go
with
me
be
still
my
heart
oh
wait
it
is
how
come
i
got
the
short
straw
you're
not
quite
as
obnoxious
as
most
of
the
alpha
males
around
here
plus
i
know
you
don't
have
a
date
i
haven't
settled
on
anyone
yet
fine
look
i
know
you
find
me
attractive
i've
seen
you
looking
at
my
breasts
nothing
personal
but
when
a
guy
does
that
it
just
means
his
eyes
are
open
whatever
look
do
you
wanna
go
with
me
or
not
anya
huh
interesting
choice
choice
is
kind
of
a
broad
term
for
my
situation
see
it's
either
anya
or
the
sock
puppet
of
love
for
this
boy
i
love
you
xander
i'll
never
leave
you
well
if
anya
tries
to
get
you
killed
put
me
down
for
a
big
'i
told
you
so'
xander
who's
this
anya
is
she
prettier
than
me
she
just
better
not
try
to
cross
me
that's
all
i'm
saying
well
at
least
we
all
have
someone
to
go
with
now
some
of
us
are
going
with
demons
but
i
think
that's
a
valid
lifestyle
choice
more
importantly
i
have
the
kick
dress
ooh
the
pink
one
angel's
gonna
lose
it
but
not
his
soul
he's
gonna
lose
it
his
it
mrs
summers
i'm
sorry
to
uh
well
i
would
have
called
but
you
know
please
you're
always
welcome
my
goodness
your
place
is
amazing
yeah
i
like
a
lot
of
space
i
don't
get
out
much
during
the
day
no
you
wouldn't
can
i
get
you
something
i
don't
have
any
coffee
oh
no
thank
you
i
uh
you
don't
drink
beverages
i
mean
no
i
do
it's
just
the
caffeine
it
makes
me
jittery
oh
i
understand
buffy
spent
the
night
i'm
sorry
about
that
we
came
back
after
patrol
i
i'm
not
interested
in
the
details
that's
not
why
i'm
here
okay
i'm
here
because
i'm
worried
about
you
two
in
general
what
happened
before
when
i
changed
it
won't
happen
again
that's
not
all
i'm
concerned
about
i
don't
have
to
tell
you
that
you
and
buffy
are
from
different
worlds
no
you
don't
she's
had
to
deal
with
a
lot
grew
up
fast
sometimes
even
i
forget
that
she's
still
just
a
girl
i'm
old
enough
to
be
her
ancestor
she's
just
starting
out
in
life
i
know
i
think
about
it
more
now
that
she's
staying
in
sunnydale
good
because
when
it
comes
to
you
angel
she's
just
like
any
other
young
woman
in
love
you're
all
she
can
see
of
tomorrow
but
i
think
we
both
know
that
there
are
some
hard
choices
ahead
if
she
can't
make
them
you're
gonna
have
to
i
know
you
care
about
her
i
just
hope
you
care
enough
so
it
was
blue
and
sorta
short
not
too
short
medium
and
it
had
this
weird
sorta
fringey
stuff
on
its
arms
what's
that
a
demon
a
prom
dress
that
will
was
thinking
of
getting
can't
you
ever
get
your
mind
out
of
the
hellmouth
i'd
be
delighted
to
however
the
day
of
the
mayor's
ascension
is
fast
approaching
and
we
don't
know
what
to
expect
well
what
about
the
pages
that
will
stole
from
the
mayor's
book
look
she
put
her
life
on
the
line
there
pal
don't
tell
me
they're
useless
on
the
contrary
no
we
uh
we
know
the
ascension
refers
to
a
human
transforming
into
a
demon
the
living
embodiment
of
an
immortal
and
graduation
day
our
mayor
wilkins
is
scheduled
to
do
just
that
trouble
is
we
don't
know
which
demon
he
is
going
to
become
there
are
thousands
of
species
so
it's
safe
to
say
we
shouldn't
waste
any
time
of
such
trifling
matters
as
a
school
dance
well
that's
too
bad
because
i
bet
you
would
look
way
007
in
a
tux
except
of
course
on
the
actual
night
i
will
be
aiding
mr
giles
in
his
chaperoning
duties
what
excuse
me
fine
fine
fine
we'll
get
you
a
dress
you
know
we
should
check
april
fools
don't
go
there
i
shop
there
i
myself
am
dipping
into
my
road
trip
fund
to
procure
a
shiny
new
tux
so
look
for
me
to
dazzle
and
i
myself
will
be
wearing
pink
taffeta
as
chenille
would
not
go
with
my
complexion
can
we
please
talk
about
the
ascension
giles
we
get
it
miles
to
go
before
we
sleep
but
especially
if
we're
all
gonna
vaporize
or
something
on
graduation
day
we
deserve
a
little
prommy
fun
one
night
of
glory
not
to
much
to
ask
into
this
holy
estate
these
two
persons
present
now
come
to
be
joined
if
any
man
can
show
just
cause
why
they
should
not
be
lawfully
joined
together
let
him
speak
now
or
else
hereinafter
hold
his
peace
angel
i
always
say
patrol's
not
complete
without
a
trip
to
the
stinky
sewers
i'm
sure
i
saw
him
come
down
here
couldn't
we
just
let
this
be
the
vamp
that
got
away
we
could
say
he
was
this
big
what
can
i
say
i
need
closure
you
need
clothes
you
don't
have
a
tux
do
you
since
when
did
patrolling
go
black
tie
for
the
prom
silly
we
have
more
important
things
to
think
about
right
now
than
a
dance
buffy
sorry
giles
i'll
just
be
quiet
come
on
don't
be
that
way
not
now
i'm
not
being
that
way
every
time
i
say
the
word
'prom'
you
get
grouchy
i'm
sorry
i'm
just
worried
that
you're
getting
tooinvested
in
this
whole
thing
what
whole
thing
isn't
this
the
stuff
that
i'm
supposed
to
get
invested
in
going
to
a
formal
graduating
growing
up
i
know
then
what
what's
with
the
dire
it's
uh
it's
nothing
no
you
have
'something'
face
i
think
we
need
to
talk
but
not
now
and
not
here
no
no
if
you
have
something
to
say
then
say
it
angel
drop
the
cryptic
you're
scaring
me
i've
been
thinking
about
our
future
and
the
more
i
do
the
more
i
feel
like
us
you
and
me
being
together
is
unfair
to
you
is
this
about
what
the
mayor
said
because
he
was
just
trying
to
shake
us
up
he
was
right
no
no
he
wasn't
he's
the
bad
guy
you
deserve
more
you
deserve
something
outside
of
demons
and
darkness
you
should
be
with
someone
who
can
take
you
into
the
light
someone
who
can
make
love
to
you
i
don't
care
about
that
you
will
and
children
children
can
you
say
jumping
the
gun
i
kill
my
goldfish
today
but
you
have
no
idea
how
fast
it
goes
buffy
before
you
know
it
you'll
want
it
all
a
normal
life
i'll
never
have
a
normal
life
right
you'll
always
be
a
slayer
but
that's
all
the
more
reason
why
you
should
have
a
real
relationship
instead
of
this
this
freak
show
i
didn't
mean
that
i'm
gonna
go
i'm
sorry
buffy
you
know
how
much
i
love
you
it
kills
me
to
say
this
then
don't
who
are
you
to
tell
me
what's
right
for
me
you
think
i
haven't
thought
about
this
have
you
rationally
no
no
of
course
not
i'm
just
some
swoony
little
schoolgirl
right
i'm
trying
to
do
what's
right
here
okay
i'm
trying
to
think
with
my
head
instead
of
my
heart
heart
you
have
a
heart
it
isn't
even
beating
don't
don't
what
don't
love
you
i'm
sorry
you
know
what
i
didn't
know
that
i
got
a
choice
in
that
i'm
never
gonna
change
i
can't
change
i
want
my
life
to
be
with
you
i
don't
you
don't
want
to
be
with
me
i
can't
believe
you're
breaking
up
with
me
it
doesn't
mean
that
i
don't

how
am
i
supposed
to
stay
away
from
you
i'm
leaving
after
the
ascension
after
it's
finished
with
the
mayor
and
faith
if
we
survive
i'll
go
where
i
don't
know
is
this
really
happening
so
that's
it
that's
it
assuming
we
survive
this
ascension
thing
he's
gonna
leave
town
well
he's
a
fool
he's
just
a
big
dumb
jerk
person
if
you
ask
me
and
he's
a
supermaxijerk
for
doing
it
right
before
the
prom
it's
not
his
fault
he's
243
years
old
he
doesn't
exactly
get
the
prom
but
he
should
if

will
it's
okay
you
don't
have
to
make
him
the
bad
guy
but
that's
the
best
friend's
job
vilifying
and
grousing
usually
yeah
but
he's
right
i
mean
i
think
maybe
in
the
long
run
that
he's
right
yeah
i
think
he
is
i
mean
i
tried
to
hope
for
the
best
but
i'm
sorry
it
must
be
horrible
i
think
horrible
is
still
coming
right
now
it's
worse
right
now
i'm
just
trying
to
keep
from
dying
oh
buffy
i
can't
breathe
will
i
feel
like
i
can't
breathe
okay
how
long
does
it
take
you
to
buy
a
damn
dress
xander
i
uh
i'm
considering
things
a
little
more
carefully
nowadays
i
don't
want
to
get
stuck
with
another
dud
well
this
should
work
for
you
it
positively
screams
nympho
is
this
a
customer
or
a
friend
neither
just
stopped
by
for
my
daily
helping
of
bile
so
you
better
get
back
to
work
and
quit
goofing
mrs
finkel
so
has
it
in
for
you

you
already
have
all
the
dresses
i
have
nothing
okay
no
dresses

a
little
mistake
on
his
taxes
for
the
last
twelve
years
satisfied
are
you
a
happy
xander
now
i'm
broke
i
can't
go
to
any
of
the
colleges
that

i
can't
stay
home
because
we
no
longer

can
run
along
and
tell
all
of
your
friends
how
cordy
finally
got
hers
how
she
has
to
work
parttime
just
to
get
a
lousy
prom
dress
on
layaway
and
how
she
has
to
wear
a
name
tag
oh
i'm
a
name
tag
person
don't
leave
that
out
the
story
just
wouldn't
have
the
same
punch
right
there
see
it's
it's
like
he
just
realized
he
forgot
to
put
money
in
the
meter
or
something
you
know
the
part
that
totally
weirded
me
out
that
thing
had
good
taste
i
mean
he
chucks
xander
and
went
right
for
the
formal
wear
that's
right
he
left
behind
his
copy
of
monsters
wear
daily
i'm
serious
look
at
the
outfit
that
xander's
wearing
now
look
at
the
kid
that
the
monster
went
after
very
smooth
lines
'til
he
was
shredded
i
don't
want
to
see
it
again
giles
buffy
i
know
it's
horrible
but
if
you're
going
to
hunt
this
creature

should
study
it

i
got
it
she's
right
i
mean
you've
seen
one
big
hairy
bringer
of
death
you've
seen
'em
all
if
i'm
not
mistaken
this
is
a
hellhound

particularly
vicious
it's
sort
of
a
demon
foot
soldier
bred
during
the
machash
wars
trained
solely
to
kill
they
feed
off
the
brains
of
their
foes

a
videotape
so
they
do
it
on
television

the
time

stay
on
the
topic

once

afternoon

was
burning

see
taillights

sense
to

have
a
nice
time
okay
then
see
ya
i
want
you
at
the
gym
keep
an
eye
on
them
until
i
get
there
i
don't
have
to
tell
you
that
you're
being
rather
rash
finding
an
address
hardly
adds
up
to
case
closed
look
it's
done
you
want
to
go
after
them
and
tell
them
that
they
can't
go
that
all
of
their
planning
and
dreaming
was
for
nothing
that
they
can't
spend
tonight
with
their
honeys
of
all
nights
angel's
not
taking
you
is
he
angel's
leaving
me
he's
leaving
town
oh
buffy
i'm
sorry
i
don't
really
know
what
to
say
um
i
understand
that
this
sort
of
thing
requires
ice
cream
of
some
kind
ice
cream
will
come
first
i
want
to
take
out
psycho
boy
you
sure
the
great
thing
about
being
a
slayer
kicking
ass
is
comfort
food
so
she
wished
her
husband's
head
would
explode
which
was
great
except
we
were
standing
three
feet
from
him
at
the
time
what
a
mess
of
course
you
know
during
the
plague
it
was
always
parts
falling
off
well
that
got
old
since
pretty
much
they
were
anyway
the
renaissance
that
was

well
i
must
say
this
is
all
rather
odd
to
me
oh
yes
at
an
allmale
preparatory
they
didn't
go
in
for
this
sort
of
thing
no
of
course
not
unless
you
count
the
nights
you
made
the
lower
classmen
get
up
as
girls
and
watched
them

dip
is
tasty
isn't
it
sauce
is
hot
very
hot
we
got
in
maybe
we
should
dance
before
we
get
besieged
bedeviled
or
beheaded
or
something
it's
not
gonna
happen
you're
not
even
a
little
nervous
you
think
buffy
is
going
to
let
us
down
want
to
share
some
punch
may
i
say
you
look
smashing
it's
a
start
so
then
this
one
time
this
girl
wished
her
ex
would
cannibalize
himself
even
i
had
a
hard
time
watching
that
let
me
tell
you
cordelia
wesley
my
god
in
heaven

good
to
see
you
how
are

you're
pathetic

how
you
did
it

how
you
brainwashed
the
hounds
to
go
psycho
on
prom
neat
huh
i
don't
get
it
what
kind
of
sicko
wants
to
destroy
the
happiest
night
of
a
senior's
life
i
have
my
reasons
do
you
want
to
go
to
the
prom
with
me

maladjust

his
reasons

for
me
you're
an
incompetent
maladjust
now
i'm
gonna
lock
you
in
here
and
then
i'm
gonna
party

redundancy
system
any
incompetent

three
fiercest
babies

coolest
devil
dogs
are
history
how's
the
prom
strangely
affecting
i
got
all
teared
up
when
they
played
'we
are
family'
everything's
perfect
and
the
award
for
sunnydale
high's
class
clown
for
1999
goes
to
jack
mayhew
please
anybody
can
be
a
prop
class
clown
you
know
none
of
the
people
who
vote
for
these
things
are
even
funny
we
have
one
more
award
to
give
out
is
buffy
summers
here
tonight
did
she
um
this
is
actually
a
new
category
first
time
ever
i
guess
there
were
a
lot
of
writein
ballots
and
um
the
prom
committee
asked
me
to
read
this
we're
not
good
friends
most
of
us
never
found
the
time
to
get
to
know
you
but
that
doesn't
mean
we
haven't
noticed
you
we
don't
talk
about
it
much
but
it's
no
secret
that
sunnydale
high
isn't
really
like
other
high
schools
a
lot
of
weird
stuff
happens
here
crowd
outbursts
zombies
hyena
people
snyder
but
whenever
there
was
a
problem
or
something
creepy
happened
you
seemed
to
show
up
and
stop
it
most
of
the
people
here
have
been
saved
by
you
or
helped
by
you
at
one
time
or
another
we're
proud
to
say
that
the
class
of
'99
has
the
lowest
mortality
rate
of
any
graduating
class
in
sunnydale
history
and
we
know
at
least
part
of
that
is
because
of
you
so
the
senior
class
offers
its
thanks
and
gives
you
uh
this
jonathan
produces
a
multicolored
glittering
miniature
umbrella
with
a
small
metal
plaque
attached
to
the
shaft
it's
from
all
of
us
and
it
has
written
here
buffy
summers
class
protector
the
crowd
breaks
into
sustained
applause
and
cheering
buffy
walks
to
the
stage
and
takes
her
award
mr
giles
i'd
like
your
opinion
while
the
last
thing
i
want
to
do
is
muddle
bad
behavior
in
front
of
impressionable
youth
i
wonder
if
asking
miss
chase
to
dance
would
for
god's
sake
man
she's
eighteen
and
you
have
the
emotional
maturity
of
a
blueberry
scone
just
have
at
it
would
you
and
stop
fluttering
about
right
then
thanks
for
that
this
isn't
bad
you
did
good
work
tonight
buffy
and
i
got
a
little
toy
surprise
i
had
no
idea
that
children
en
masse
could
be
gracious
every
now
and
then
people
surprise
you
every
now
and
then
giles
takes
her
umbrella
and
leaves
buffy
turns
to
see
angel
at
the
door
they
meet
i
never
thought
you'd
come
it's
a
big
night
i
didn't
want
to
miss
it
it's
just
tonight
it
doesn't
mean
that
i

i
know
i
mean
i
understand
dance
with
me
