i
don't
know
i
was
going
for
ferocious
scary
but
it's
coming
out
more
dryly
sardonic
it
does
appear
to
be
mocking
you
with
its
eyeholes
the
nose
hole
seems
sad
and
full
of
selfloathing
what
do
you
think
buff
i
was
just
thinking
about
the
life
of
a
pumpkin
grow
up
in
the
sun
happily
entwined
with
others
then
someone
comes
along
cuts
you
open
and
rips
your
guts
out
okay
and
on
that
happy
note
i've
got
a
treat
for
tomorrow
nights
second
annual
halloween
screening
people
prepare
to
have
your
spines
tingled
your
gooses
bumped
by
the
terrifying
fantasia
fantasia
maybe
it's
because
of
all
the
horrific
things
we've
seen
but
hippos
wearing
tutus
just
don't
unnerve
me
the
way
they
used
to
phantasm
it
was
supposed
to
be
'phantasm
i
thought
we
were
doing
the
alpha
delt
thing
what
thing
the
scary
house
sounds
kinda
lame
it
actually
borders
on
fun
you
have
to
go
through
the
scary
house
maze
to
get
to
the
party
which
is
usually
worth
getting
to
those
guys
go
all
out
as
witnessed
last
friday
very
true
there
is
a
party
we
didn't
tell
you
no
it's
cool
you
guys
got
your
little
college
thing
i'm
fine
i
mean
i
got
better
things
to
do
than
tag
along
to
some
fraternity
you
can
come
okay
but
only
because
i
lied
about
having
better
things
to
do
a
blast
will
be
had
by
all
i'm
gonna
get
going
now
tonight's
still
okay
it's
a
little
mature
but
still
i'm
sleepy
you
guys
have
fun
you
want
me
to
come
with
no
i'm
fine
sad
buffy
she
didn't
even
touch
her
pumpkin
it's
a
freak
with
no
face
she's
still
suffering
a
little
postparker
depression
bailing
on
the
buff
does
anyone
else
want
to
smack
that
guy
jeez
that
hurt
what
the
hell
is
wrong
with
you
lady
that's
what
i'd
like
to
know
i've
got
the
basics
down
–
levitation
charms
glamours
i
just
feel
like
i've
plateaued
wiccawise
what's
the
next
level
transmutation
conjuring
bringing
forth
something
from
nothing
gets
pretty
close
to
the
primal
forces
a
little
scary
well
no
one's
pushing
you
know
if
it's
too
much
don't
do
it
don't
do
it
what
kind
of
encouragement
is
that
this
is
an
'encouragement'
talk
i
thought
it
was
'share
my
pain'
i
don't
know
then
again
what
is
college
for
if
not
experimenting
you
know
maybe
i
can
handle
it
i'll
know
when
i've
reached
my
limit
wine
coolers
magic
ooh
you
didn't
encourage
her
did
you
where
is
supportive
boyfriend
guy
he's
picking
up
your
dry
cleaning
but
he
told
me
to
tell
you
that
he's
afraid
you're
gonna
get
hurt
okay
brutus
brutus
–
caesar
betrayal
–
trusted
friend
back
stabby
oh
i'm
with
you
on
the
reference
but
–
i
won't
lie
about
the
fact
that
i
worry
i
know
what
it's
like
to
have
power
you
can't
control
i
mean
every
time
i
start
to
wolf
out
i
touch
something
–deep
–
dark
it's
not
fun
but
just
know
that
what
ever
you
decide
i
back
your
play
see
concerned
boy
sweet
boy
i
kinda
like
him
worrying
anyway

i
forgot
–
to
be
hungry
wait
buffy
buffy
don't
let
jerky
parker
chase
you
away
he
didn't
i
just
don't
want
to
deal
with
this
right
now
i'm
taking
a
holiday
from
dealing
happily
vacationing
in
the
land
of
not
coping
you
know
what
you'll
feel
better
at
the
party
tonight
maybe
you'll
even
meet
someone
willow
i
don't
want
to
meet
someone
i've
reached
my
quota
on
someone's
besides
i
think
i'm
gonna
have
to
patrol
anyway
tonight
but
–
it's
halloween
i'll
doublecheck
with
giles
but
i'm
sure
he's
going
to
think
i
should
be
on
active
slayer
duty
he
doesn't
care
about
halloween
happy
hallow
hello
buffy
oh
–
my
–
god
it's
a
sombrero
and
it's
on
your
head
it
seemed
festive
uhm
come
in
candy
what's
going
on
here
you
hate
halloween
i
never
said
any
such
a
thing
as
my
watcher's
duties
took
precedence
i
simply
haven't
taken
time
to
–
well
to
embrace
its
inherent
charms
–
until
now
look
look
it's
alive
see
–
how
he
shakes
is
–
is
there
something
you
wanted
i
was
thinking
that
i
should
patrol
tonight
you
know
possibly
the
cemetery
or
if
you
had
a
better
su
could
you
please
take
that
off
oh
yes
of
course
i
see
is
there
some
specific
danger
you
were
sensing
no
but
then
you
know
we
were
all
caught
of
guard
when
ethan
turned
everyone
into
their
costumes
true
but
what
happened
then
was
anomalous
creatures
of
the
night
shy
away
form
halloween
they
find
it
all
much
too
crass
hard
to
believe
well
ii
promise
you
there
is
little
likelihood
of
any
supernatural
activity
tonight
you
sure
you
don't
want
one
i
come
bearing
spiders
the
sound
system
is
not
going
to
cut
it
nothing
but
lame
you
want
me
to
call
oz
he
can
probably
hook
us
up
do
it
if
we
not
scare
the
young
women
they
will
not
fall
into
our
arms
we'll
have
womanless
arms
halloween
isn't
about
thrills
chills
and
funny
costumes
it's
about
getting
laid
is
there
any
holiday
that's
not
about
getting
laid
arbor
day
call
oz
dude
done
and
oh

wanted
a
symbol

only
said
that
because
i
thought
that's
what
you
wanted
to
hear
that's
the
funny
thing
about
me
i
tend
to
hear
the
actual
words
people
say
and
accept
them
at
face
value
that's
stupid
i
accept
that
i
can't
say
seeing
you
falls
into
the
realm

civilian

so
normal
you
sure
we
should
let
him
come

the
party
oz
hey
standing
right
here
cranking
you're
sensing
a
disturbance
in
the
force
master
ah
the
left
speaker
is
crackling
a
little
bit
and
you
feel
stabbing
it
is
the
proper
solution
i'm
just
going
to
trim
the
wire
it
might
be
a
short
ah
oz
cut
myself
it's
okay
playing
with
knives
fun
yes
but
not
safe
and
when
you
bleed
to
death
i've
got
dibs
on
your
equipment
thanks
again
for
doing
this
at
the
last
minute
i'm
just
glad
i
could
find
it
there
try
it
now
i
let
down
the
hem
and
loosened
it
a
little
around
the
hood
oh
it
feels
better
oh
no
someone
is
getting
nostalgic
face
i'm
sorry
i'm
thinking
about
the
little
girl
who
wore
that
what
is
it
five
six
years
ago
yeah
little
red
riding
hood
was
the
cutting
edge
in
costumes
your
father
loved
to
take
you
out
he
was
such
a
pain
12
years
old
and
i
can't
go
trickortreating
by
myself
he
just
wanted
to
keep
you
safe
no
he
wanted
the
candy
i
was
just
the
beard
oh
that's
not
true
actually
the
candy
was
for
me
your
father
loved
spending
time
with
you
not
enough
i
guess
buffy
oh
that
just
paved
right
over
memory
lane
huh
our
divorce
had
nothing
to
do
with
you
i
don't
know
–
i'm
starting
to
feel
like
there
is
a
pattern
here
–
open
your
heart
to
someone
and
he
bails
on
you
maybe
it's
easier
to
just
not
let
anyone
in
i
thought
it
might
be
easier
you
must
have
noticed
that
i
am
not
exactly
the
social
butterfly
i
was
when
i
was
with
your
dad
i
don't
think
i
made
a
single
new
friend
the
year
we
moved
to
sunnydale
why
not
fear
i
didn't
believe
i
could
trust
anyone
again
it's
taken
time
and
a
lot
of
effort
but
i've
got
a
nice
circle
of
friends
now
i
mean
don't
get
me
wrong
i
–
i'm
still
a
little
gun
shy
it
certainly
didn't
help
that
my
last
boyfriend
turned
out
to
be
a
homicidal
robot
i
will
always
be
here
for
you
and
you
got
mr
giles
and
your
friends
believe
me
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
no
i
just
meet
you
at
your
place
–
yeah
buffy
said
she
was
coming
but
i
haven't
seen
her
we
have
to
make
sure
she
has
fun
we
have
to
force
fun
upon
her
and

just
axmurder
him

halloweeny

of
power

figured
we
had
a
lot
in
common
seeing
as
how
i
was
almost
burned
at
the
stake
and
plus
she
had
that
close
relationship
with
god
and
you
are
of
course
i
wish
i'd
thought
of
that
before
i
put
down
my
deposit
i
could
have
been
god
blasphemer
nice
costumes
very
stealthy
what
are
they
supposed
to
be
nato
oh
yeah
i
ah
invited
anya
to

having
some
trouble

she's
just
going
to
meet
us
there
perfect
everybody's
got
a
date

me
let
the
horrors
begin
god
help

be
fairly
traumatic

that
part
was
realistic
frat
boys
aren't
too
obsessive
with
their
cleaning

was
in
the

anxious
for
me
to
come
i'm
serious
buffy
we
don't
know
what
we're
dealing
with
my
turn
does
anyone
hear
that
as
soon
as
we
start
dealing
with
it
i'll
know
what
it
is
we're
dealing
with
do
you
hear
something
like
i
said
sounds
like
a
hissing
it's
like
a
'ssss'
noise
i
thought
the
word
hissing
kind
of
covered
that
nicely
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
know
i'm
sorry
chaz
i
didn't
know
what's
happening
it
ah
what
is
it
it's
alive
it's
alive
what's
alive
he's
in
shock
chaz
what
happened
here
i
think
the
cape
took
most
of
it'
let
me
see
could
need
stitches
you
should
at
least
get
a
bandage
or
something
cowering
in
a
closet
is
starting
to
seem
like
a
reasonable
plan
what
closet
i'm
gonna
make
my
way
upstairs
and
see
if
there
are
any
people
up
there
you
guys
find
a
way
out
of
the
house
and
use
it
you're
telling
us
to
run
away
and
leave
you
behind
we
need
help
we
need
the
only
person
that
can
make
sense
of
what's
happening
just
a
minute
coming
happy
hall
xander
is
in
trouble
we've
got
to
do
something
right
now
anya
are
you
listening
xander
is
trapped
uh
ah
where
is
buffy
and
the
others
they're
trapped
too
but
we've
got
to
save
xander
slow
down
i
need
you
to
be
more
specific
uhm
ah
we
were
supposed
to
meet
at
this
house
and
i
got
there
and
there
was
no
door
where
a
door
should
be
and
then
i
see
this
girl
standing
in
a
window
and
then
poof
she's
gone
she
vanished
from
the
window
no
the
window
vanished
from
the
house
hmm
matter
and
reality
distortion
like
a
summoning
spell's
temporal
flux
what
hmm
oh
never
mind
i
just
need
to
get
some
supplies
together
i
wouldn't
worry
about
xander
at
least
he's
amongst
friends
will
i'm
telling
you
you're
telling
me
you're
telling
me
i
can't
do
my
job
if
i
have
to
worry
about
each
of
your
safety
it's
not
your
decision
got
to
disagree
with
you
there
oh
of
course
you
do
let's
all
take
a
breath
buffy
maybe
being
the
slayer
doesn't
automatically
make
you
boss
you're
as
lost
as
the
rest
of
us
what
are
we
talking
about
it's
a
simple
incantation
a
guiding
spell
for
travelers
when
they
become
lost
or
disoriented
and
how
does
it
work
it
conjures
an
emissary
from
the
beyond
that
–
lights
the
way
conjuring
will
let's
be
realistic
here
okay
your
basic
spells
are
usually
only
fiftyfifty
oh
yeah
well
so
is
your
face
what
what
does
that
mean
i'm
not
your
sidekick
well
that
was
a
bunch
of
laughs
look
buffy
we
are
all
tired
and
a
little
edgy
maybe
willow
is
overreacting
i'm
sure
part
of
it
is
because
of
how
you've
been
'pushing
away'
girl
lately
but
now
is
not
the
time
to
let
that
stuff
tear
us
apart
what
i'm
saying
is
i'm
right
with
ya
i'm
right
by
your
side

xander

haven't
lost
your
sense
of
inappropriate
humor
xander

did
you
go

scared
that
we
ended
up

–
why
i
saw

painting
that
they
were
copying
it
out
of
that
i
think
it's
gaelic
can
you
translate
release
me
release
me
will
give
me
something
okay
uhm
uhm
the
icon's
called
thethe
mark
of
gachnar
ii
think
this
is
a
summoning
spell
for
something
called
gachnar
well
yes
somehow
the
beginning
of
the
spell
must
have
been
triggered
uhm
gachnar
is
trying
to
manifest
itself
toto
come
into
being
how
iit
feeds
on
fear
our
fears
are
manifesting
it
we're
feeding
it
we
need
to
stop
if
we're
close
our
eyes
and
say
it's
a
dream
it'll
stab
us
to
death
these
things
are
real
release
me
okay
so
our
fears
are
feeding
it
if
we
get
everyone
out
of
here
good
plan
let's
go
giles
everyone
it's
giles
with
a
chainsaw
glad
you
could
make
it
the
walls
closed
up
behind
us
gachnar
of
course
it's
presence
infects
the
reality
of
the
house
but
it's
not
managed
to
achieve
full
manifestation
we
can
not
allow
this
to
come
into
being
but
if
it
does
i
can
fight
it
right
buffy
this
is
gachnar
i
don't
want
to
fight
that
so
we
break
the
spell
what
ever
we
do
lets
do
it
fast
i
have
it
i
have
it
uhm
'the
summoning
spell
for
gachnar
can
be
shut
down
in
one
of
two
ways
destroying
the
mark
of
gachnar
–
is
not
one
of
them
and
will
in
fact
immediately
bring
forth
the
fear
demon
itself
look
this
is
gachnar
big
overture
little
show
i
am
the
dark
lord
of
nightmares
the
bringer
of
terror
tremble
before
me
fear
me

–
he's
no
cute
tremble
who's
a
little
fear
demon
come
on
who's
a
little
fear
demon
don't
taunt
the
fear
demon
why
can
he
hurt
me
no
it's
just
–
tacky
be
that
as
it
may
buffy
when
it
comes
to
slaying
size
doesn't
matter
they're
all
going
to
abandon
you
you
know
yeah

some
quality
treats

them
uhm
this
is
much
better
there
is
no
problem
that
can
not
be
solved
with
chocolate
i
think
i'm
going
to
barf
except
that
what
that's
your
scary
costume
bunnies
frighten
me
oh
bloody
hell

say
actual
size
