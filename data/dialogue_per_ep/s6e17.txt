find
her
i
need
to
her
suitcase

and
some
of
her
stuff
there's
a
closed
sign
on
the
magic
box
which
like
chills
me
to
the
bone
she
left
a
couple
days
ago
was
she
looking
for
me
before
she
left
did
she
say
anything
you
mean
between
sobs
there
was
mostly
just
wheezing
she
was
a
little
she
was
kinda
broken
i
don't
know
how
stuff
got
so
mixed
up
i
blew
it
no
well
maybe
it
wasn't
the
best
time
to
break
up
with
her
but
no
it
wasn't
about
breaking
up
i
love
her
and
god
i
miss
her
so
much
so
you
left
her
at
the
altar
but
you
still
wanna
buffy
you
still
wanna
date
i
guess
i
know
that
i'm
a
better
person
with
her
in
my
life
but
things
got
so
complicated
with
the
wedding
and
with
my
family
and
with
her
demons
and
what
if
it
all
goes
to
hell
aand
forever
but
then
i
left
and
ever
since
i've
had
this
painful
hole
inside
and
i'm
the
idiot
that
dug
it
out
i
screwed
up
real
bad
hey
we
all
screw
up
you
lookin'
for
me
really
not
oh
right
then
off
you
go
did
you
cry
what
the
wedding
two
hearts
joined
for
eternity
great
pelting
showers
of
rice
and
so
forth
you
didn't
hear
what
families
get
out
of
hand
tear
the
place
apart
no
well
yes
absolutely
but
xander
left
the
wedding
didn't
happen
well
gotta
say
i
didn't
see
that
coming
it
was
awful
anya
was
devastated
is
that
right
and
xander
thinks
maybe
they
can
still
get
back
together
but
he
hurt
her
a
lot
yeah
well
some
people
can't
see
a
good
thing

of
dangerous
contraband
he
had
tell
you
what
slayer
let
me
get
out
of
your
way

stop
bothering

back
of
her
neck
she
likes

i've
been
having
these
flashes
hallucinations
i
guess
since
when
uh
night
before
last
i
was
uh
checking
houses
on
that
list
you
gave
me
and
looking
for
warren
and
his
pals
and
then
bam
some
kind
of
gross
waxy
demonthing
poked
me
and
when
you
say
poke
in
the
arm
it
stung
me
or
something
and
then
i
was
like
no
it
it
wasn't
like
i
was
in
an
institution
there
were
um
doctors
and
nurses
and
and
other
patients
they
they
told
me
that
i
was
sick
i
guess
crazy
and
that
um
sunnydale
and
and
all
of
this
it
none
of
it
was
real
oh
come
on
that's
ridiculous
what
you
think
this
isn't
real
just
because
of
all
the
vampires
and
demons
and
exvengeance
demons
and
the
sister
that
used
to
be
a
big
ball
of
universedestroying
energy
i
know
how
this
must
sound
but
it
felt
so
real
mom
was
there
she
was
dad
too
they
were
together

like
they
used
to
be
before
sunnydale
okay
all
in
favor
of
research
motion
passed
all
right
xander
you
hit
the
demon
bars
dig
up
any
info
on
a
new
player
in
town
dawnie
you
can
help
me
research
we'll
hop
online
check
all
the
flash
back
to
the
asylum
crazybuffy
is
sitting
in
the
chair
with
her
face
squinched
up
in
the
same
way
possibilities
for
a
full
recovery
but
we
have
to
proceed
cautiously
if
we're
not
careful
joyce
wait
are
you
saying
that
buffy
could
be
like
she
was
before
any
of
this
happened
mrs
summers
you
have
to
understand
the
severity
of
what's
happened
to
your
daughter
for
the
last
six
years
she's
been
in
an
undifferentiated
type
of
schizophrenia
we
know
what
her
condition
is
that's
not
what
we're
asking
buffy's
delusions
are
multilayered
she
believes
she's
some
type
of
hero
the
slayer
the
slayer
right
but
that's
only
one
level
she's
also
created
an
intricate
latticework
to
support
her
primary
delusion
in
her
mind
she's
the
central
figure
in
a
fantastic
world
beyond
imagination
she's
surrounded
herself
with
friends
most
with
their
own
superpowers
who
are
as
real
to
her
as
you
or
me
more
so
unfortunately
together
they
face
grand
overblown
conflicts
against
an
assortment
of
monsters
both
imaginary
and
rooted
in
actual
myth
every
time
we
think
we're
getting
through
to
her
more
fanciful
enemies
magically
appear
buffy
how
did
i
miss
doctor
and
she's
buffy
warren
and
jonathan
they
did
this
to
me
buffy
it's
all
right
they
can't
hurt
you
here
you're
with
your
family
dawn
that's
the
sister
right
a
magical
key
buffy
inserted
dawn
into
her
delusion
actually
rewriting
the
entire
history
of
it
to
accommodate
a
need
for
a
familial
bond
buffy
but
that
created
inconsistencies
didn't
it
your
sister
your
friends
all
of
those
people
you
created
in
sunnydale
they
aren't
as
comforting
as
they
once
were
are
they
they're
coming
apart
buffy
listen
to
what
the
doctor's
saying
it's
important
buffy
you
used
to
create
these
grand
villains
to
battle
against
and
now
what
is
it
just
ordinary
students
you
went
to
high
school
with
no
gods
or
monsters
just
three
pathetic
little
men
who
like
playing
with
toys
dude
that
poison
has
got
her
drooling
like
a
some
kind
of
jonathan
where
have
you
guys
been
uh
picking
up
some
stuff
and
checking
out
buffy
on
the
van's
remote
surveillance
andrew's
demon
pet
has
done
some
number
on
the
slayer
got
her
tripping
like
a
ken
russell
film
festival
well
what
kind
of
stuff
what
the
packages
what's
in
them
well
what
do
you
think
spanky
you
think
we're
plotting
against
you
better
not
be
it's
just
stuff
big
man
all
right
you'll
be
in
the
know
just
as
soon
as
you
stop
being
all
freakazoid
ah
now
there's
the
vault
i
still
say
we're
gonna
need
eight
other
guys
to
pull
this
off
i
never
should
have
let
you
see
that
movie
wha
uh
where
you
going
out
getting
stuff
i
need
you
know
i
don't
really
think
that's
such
a
good
idea
why
not
well
it's
it's
just
not
safe
out
there
alone
you
saw
how
close
the
slayer
got
look
we're
we're
a
team
something
happens
to
you
it
happens
to
all
of
us
right
look
i
know
i
know
you're
antsy
we
all
are
but
you
see
things
they're
about
to
pick
up
big
big
time
just
gotta
be
careful
right
all
right
stick
together
okay
look
buffy
i
found
the
demon
fits
your
description
and
symptoms
perfectly
look
is
this
it
see
it's
gonna
be
okay
its
pokey
stinger
carries
an
antidote
to
its
own
poison
i
feel
so
lost
i
know
you're
confused
it's
it's
that
crazy
juice
inside
you
it's
more
than
that
even
before
the
demon
i've
been
so
detached
we've
all
been
kind
of
slumming
every
day
i
try
to
snap
out
of
it
figure
out
why
i'm
like
that
buffy
look
at
me
you
are
not
in
an
institution
you
have
never
been
in
an
institution

have
what
back
when
i
saw
my
first
vampires
i
got
so
scared
i
told
my
parents
and
they
completely
freaked
out
they
thought
there
was
something
seriously
wrong
with
me
so
they
sent
me
to
a
clinic
you
never
said
anything
i
was
only
there
a
couple
of
weeks
i
stopped
talking
about
it
and
they
let
me
go
eventually
my
parents
just
forgot
god
that's
horrible
what
if
i'm
still
there
what
if
i
never
left
that
clinic

thinks
none
of
us

ask
me
spike
we
need
muscle
not
color
commentary
on
the
other
hand
it
might
explain
some
things
this
all
being
in
that
twisted
brain
of
hers

with
a
frustrated
expression
i
hope
you
don't
think
this
antidote's
gonna
rid
you
of
that
nasty
martyrdom
see
i
figured
it
out
luv
you
can't
help
yourself
you're
not
drawn
to
the
dark
like
i
thought
you're
addicted
to
the
misery
it's
why
you
won't
tell
your
pals
about
us
might
actually
have
to
be
happy
if
you
did
they'd
either
understand
and
help
you
god
forbid
or
drive
you
out
where
you
can
finally
be
at
peace
in
the
dark
with
me
either
way
you'd
be
better
off
for
it
but
you're
too
twisted
for
that
let
yourself
live
already
and
stop
with
the
bloody
hero
trip
for
a
sec
we'd
all
be
the
better
for
it
you
either
tell
your
friends
about
us
or
i
will
buffy
i
don't
wanna
go
back
there
i
wanna
be
healthy
again
what
do
i
have
to
do
oh
please
help
me
ii
wanna
go
home
with
you
and
dad
i
know
buffy
but
first
you've
gotta
get
better
it's
not
gonna
be
easy
buffy
you
have
to
take
it
one
step
at
a
time
you
have
to
start
ridding
your
mind
of
those
things
that
support
your
hallucinations
you
understand
there
are
things
in
that
world
that
you
cling
to
for
your
delusion
they're
safeholds
but
for
your
mind
they're
traps
we
have
to
break
those
down
slaying
yes
but
i'm
talking
about
those
things
you
want
there
what
keeps
you
going
back
my
friends
that's
right
last
summer
when
you
had
a
momentary
awakening
it
was
them
that
pulled
you
back
in
they're
not
really
your
friends
buffy
they're
just
tricks
keeping
you
from
getting
healthy
you
have
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
convince
yourself
of
that
buffy
whatever
it
takes
oh
buffy
i
i
didn't
see
you
i
was
just
coming
to
check
on
you
you
feeling
better
did
the
antidote
work
i'm
still
pretty
dazed
but
uh
better
no
more
cuckoo's
nest
well
we
still
have
the
big
bad
all
tranked
out
down
in
the
basement
in
case
it
didn't
work
and

need
more
parts
it'll
be
nice
to
see

energy
