miss
him
when

town
let's
go
find
out
how
buffy's
doing
who's
going
to
look
after
him
it's
a
she
and
aren't
these
things
supposed
to
take
care
of
themselves
a
higher
power
guiding
us
i'm
pretty
sure
that's
not
what
i
meant
there's
something
i'm
supposed
to
be
doing
oh
yeah
miles
to
go
little
ms
muffet
counting
down
from
730
great
riddles
sorry
it's
my
head
a
lot
of
new
stuff
they
are
never
going
to
fix
this
are
they
what
about
you
scar
tissue
it
fades
it
all
fades
you
want
to
know
the
deal
human
weakness
never
goes
away
not
even
his
is
this
your
mind
or
mine
beats
me
getting
towards
that
time
how
are
you
going
to
fit
all
this
stuff
not
gonna
it's
yours
i
can't
use
all
of
this
just
take
what
you
need
you're
ready
buffy
are
you
okay
how
do
you
feel
is
angel
here
he
had
to
go
it
got
kinda
sunny
get
him
get
everyone
what
exactly
is
up
buffy
are
you
sure
you're
all
right
i'm
ready
ready
for
what
war
so
am
i
crazy
well
'crazy'
is
such
a
strong
word
let's
not
rule
it
out
though
you
don't
think
it
can
be
done
i
didn't
say
that
i
might
but
not
yet
i
personally
don't
think
it's
impossible
to
come
up
with
a
crazier
plan
we
attack
the
mayor
with
humus
i
stand
corrected
just
trying
to
keep
things
in
perspective
thank
you
my
point
however
is
crazy
or
not
it's
pretty
much
the
only
plan
besides
it's
buffy's
and
she's
slay
gal
you
know
ms
little
likestofight
so
i
think
there
was
a
'yea'
vote
buried
in
there
somewhere
well
i'm
going
to
need
every
single
one
of
you
on
board
especially
you
xander
you're
sort
of
the
key
figure
here
key
me
okay
pride
humility
and
here
is
the
mindnumbing
fear
what
do
i
have
to
do
do
you
remember
any
of
your
military
training
from
when
you
became
soldier
guy
uh
rocket
launcher
rocket
launcher
not
going
to
get
it
done
i
mean
it
took
a
volcano
to
kill
one
of
these
things
last
time
um
buffy
all
of
this
is
rather
depended
on
your
being
able
to
control
the
mayor
faith
told
me
to
play
on
his
human
weakness
faith
told
you
was
that
before
or
after
you
put
her
into
a
coma
after
oh
his
weakness
right
which
is…
you
know
i
do
all
this
planing
i'm
in
charge
here
even
though
i
am
really
not
at
my
best…
well
let's…
let's…ah
let's
think
well
angel
you
hung
with
him
the
most
is
there
something
that
he's
afraid
of
well
he's
not
crazy
about
germs
of
course
that's
it
we
attack
him
with
germs
great
we'll
corner
him
and
then
you
can
sneeze
on
him
no
no
we'll
get
a
box
with
the
ebola
virus
and…
and…
or
it
doesn't
even
have
to
be
real
we
can
just
get
a
box
that
says
ebola
on
it
and…
uhm
chase
him…
with
the
box…
i'm
starting
to
lean
towards
the
humus
offensive
he'll
never
see
it
coming
faith
at
the
hospital
he
was
grieving
seriously
crazed
and
not
just
in
a
homicidal
i
want
to
be
a
demon
way
she
is
his
weak
link
faith
i
can
work
that
you
haven't
an
enormous
amount
of
time
hey
it's
mr
statestheobvious
the
council
is
not
welcome
here
i
have
no
time
for
orders
if
i
need
someone
to
scream
like
a
woman
i'll
give
you
a
call
i'm
not
here
for
the
council
just
tell
me
how
i
can
help
that
is
so
classy
isn't
he
just
so
classy
it's
a
start
so
there
is
something
i
can
do…
besides
scream
like
a
woman
there
is
plenty
there
is
chores
for
everyone
okay
this
is…
…how
it's
going
to
lay
out
the
transformation
should
begin
at
exactly
328
i'll
just
be
finishing
my
speech
you
know
it's
too
bad
you
fellows
have
to
miss
that
because
i
think
it
speaks
to
every
one
of
us
i
mean
heck
i've
been
working
on
it
for
a
hundred
years
it
better
be
good
they'll
try
to
run
of
course
and
this
is
when
i'll
need
you
boys
in
flanking
position
but
sir
the
sun
not
a
problem
darkness
will
follow
and
day
becomes
night
an
eclipse
standard
procedure
for
an
ascension
that
puts
me
back
into
the
game
yea
it
does
you
and
xander
are
going
to
have
to
work
together
now
can
you
guys
handle
that
but
i'm
still
keyguy
right
right
then
angel
in
his
non
keyguy
capacity
can
work
with
me
what
fun
hey
keyguy
is
still
talking…
oh
that's
good
start
bickering
that's
going
to
look
great
for
us
you
guys
are
like
little
old
ladies
you
come
up
through
the
sewers
here
the
important
thing
is
containment
i'll
need
to
feed
it's
crucial
in
the
first
few
minutes
to
sustain
the
change
what
does
that
mean
no
snacking
i
see
blood
on
your
lips
it's
a
visit
to
the
wood
shed
for
you
boys
kill
don't
feed
so
how
are
we
coming
on
vulcano
detail
i
think
we
can
work
it
out
fun
with
chemistry
xander
said
he
should
be
able
to
get
the
materials
who's
going
to
stoke
it
up
you
feel
up
to
it
ah
i
suppose
it
should
be
i
it's
strangely
fitting
in
a
grotesque
fashion
okay
guys
start
reaching
out
giles
weapons
weapons
weapons
ah
what
about
you
there
is
something
i
have
to
get
remember
fast
and
brutal
it's
going
to
be
a
whole
new
world
come
nightfall
don't
want
to
weaken
now
and
boys
let's
watch
the
swearing
harmony
listen
i
need
to
talk
to
you
for
a
second
you
mean
in
front
of
other
people
are
they
serious
i'm
going
to
look
stupid
in
this
percy
do
i
look
stupid
in
this
be
honest
you
look
great
you
got
a
sec
cordelia
yes
you
know
that…
when
this
is
over…
yes
uhm
well
should
we
prevail…
i'll
be
going
back
to
england
i
know
with
buffy
no
longer
working
for
the
council
there
really
is…
no
place
for
me
here
i
guess
not
no…
reason
to
stay
no
no
no…
cause
to
hope
that…
i
might
be
needed
needed
or…
wanted…
wanted…
good
luck
in
england
yes

i'll
drop
you
a
line

a
good
time

guess
that's
it
won't
be
long

in
a…
terrified
way
we'll
make
it
through
this
are
you
sure
i
sound
pretty
sure
don't
i
yeah
then
i
must
be
sure
is
that
just
a
comforting
way
of
not
answering
the
question
how
long
till
graduation
a
little
while
did
you
get
what
you
needed
yeah
i
did
this
isn't
going
to
be
enough
giles

on
it
how
are
you
i
heal
fast
like
you
so
are
we
sure
that
everyone
knows
what
their
position…
i'm
not
going
to
say
goodbye
if
we
get
through
this…
i'm
just
going
to
go
you
understand
there
is
just
too
much
to…
congratulations
to
the
class
of
1999
you
all
proved
more
or
less
adequate
this
is
a
time
of
celebration

still
and
be
quiet

gum

our
distinguished
guest
speaker
richard
wilkins

3rd
i
saw
that
gesture
you

me
after
graduation

i
late
to
the
fight
well
what
a
day
this
is
special
day
today
is
our
centennial
the
one
hundreds
anniversary
of
the
founding
of
sunnydale
and
i
know
what
that
means
to
all
you
kids
not
a
darn
thing
because
today
something
much
more
important
happens
today
you
all
graduate
from
high
school
today
all
the
pain
all
the
work
all
the
excitement
is
finally
over
and
what's
a
hundred
years
of
history
compared
to
that
you
know
what
kids
oh
my
god
he's
going
to
do
the
entire
speech
man
just
ascend
already
evil
…
for
all
of
you
it
may
be
that
there
is
a
place
in
sunnydale's
history
whether
you
like
it
or
not
it's
been
a
long
road
getting
here
for
you…
for
sunnydale
there
has
been
achievement
joy
good
times…
and
there
has
been
grief
there's
been
loss
some
people
who
should
be
here
today…
aren't
but
we
are
journey's
end
and
what
is
a
journey
is
it
just…
distance
traveled
time
spent
no
it's
what
happens
on
the
way
it's
the
things
that
happen
to
you
at
the
end
of
the
journey
you're
not
the
same
today
is
about
change
graduation
doesn't
just
mean
your
circumstances
change
it
means
you
do
you
ascend…
to
a
higher
level
nothing
will
ever
be
the
same
nothing
and
so
as
we
look
back
on…
on
the
events
that
brought
us
to
this
day
come
on
we…
we
must
all…

has
begun
my
destiny
it's
a
little
sooner
than
i
expected
i
had

guess

big
finish

dick
well
gosh
if
i
could…
could
just
get
something
for
the
pain
it's
rather
a
lot
of
pain
actually
aspirin
if
you
would…
uh…
ah…
perhaps
i
could
just
be
knocked
unconscious
we
got
off
pretty
cheap…
considering
seems
like
we
did
he
made
it
through
the
fight
guess
maybe
he
he
took
off
after
are
you
all
right
i'm
tired
i
should
imagine
so
it's
been
quite
a
couple
of
days
i
haven't
processed
everything
yet
my
brain
isn't
really
functioning
on
the
higher
levels
it's
pretty
much
fire
bad
tree
pretty
understandable
well
when
it's
working
again
congratulate
it
on
a
good
campaign
you
did
very
well
thank
you
i
will
i
ah…
i
managed
to
ferret
this
out
of
the
wreckage
now
it
may
not
interest
you
but…
i'd
say
you
earned
it
there
is
a
certain
dramatic
irony
that's
attached
to
all
this
a
synchronicity
that
borders
on…
on
predestination
one
might
say
fire
bad
tree
pretty'
yes
s…sorry
i'm
going
to
see
to
wesley
see
if
he's…
is
still…
whimpering
well
that’s
the
most
fun
you
can
have
without
having
any
fun
how
about
the
part
where
we
kicked
some
demon
ass
i
didn't
hate
that
hear
hear
you
guys
want
to
take
off
i
think
we've
done
pretty
much
all
we
can
i'm
for
it
are
you
okay
yeah…
i'm
okay
i
could
use
a
little
sleep
though
yeah
if
someone
could
just
wake
me
when
it's
time
to
go
to
college
that'd
be
great
guys
take
a
moment
to
deal
with
this
we
survived
it
was
a
hell
of
a
battle
not
the
battle
high
school
we're
taking
a
moment
and
we're
done
well
school's
done
it's
so
cool
why
do
demons
even
come
here
anymore
i
mean
don't
they
know…
