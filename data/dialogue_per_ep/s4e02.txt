it
you
bet
it
just
gets
funer
and
funer
every
time
you
playit
going
out

of
an
'up'

with
the
motorbike
and
scooter
magazine
congratulations
you've
found
me
out
i'm
a
mod
jogger
ok
you're
not
having
one
of
those
midlife
things
are
you
'cause
i'm
still
going
'ick'
from
the
last
time
you
tried
to
recapture
your
youth
buffy
sorry
demon
last
night
made
with
the
pummeling
but
he
got
away
what
sort
of
demon
umm
had
a
cloak
on
and
glowing
green
eyes
and
skin
had
a
like
superbad
fake
rubon
tan
translate
orangey
thank
you
anything
else
my
roommate
kathy
was
there
but
she
didn't
see
anything
you
took
your
roommate
patrolling
with
you
well
i
invited
the
whole
dorm
but
she
was
the
only
one
that
could
make
it
i
told
her
i
was
going
for
coffee
and
she
decided
to
tag
along
right
well
we
should
discourage
her
from
that
habit
from
what
you
described
ii'm
not
familiar
with
the
creature
but
ii'll
look
into
it
and
give
you
a
ring
when
i've
found
something
you
know
it's
nice
out
here
yes
i
take
my
tea
out
here
sometimes
what
are
you
doing
today
uh
it's
a
good
day
for
me
actually
a
friend
of
mine
recently
acquired
auh
an
original
gutenberg
demonography
and
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
you've
never
once
asked
me
what
my
day's
plans
were
which
leads
me
to
inquire
whether
you're
feeling
entirely
yourself
that's
not
true
i
ask
about
you
all
the
time
ok
well
maybe
the
words
don't
actually
make
it
out
of
my
mouth
but
i
think
about
it
and
it's
appreciated
which
doesn't
explain
why
you're
hanging
around
here
instead
of
rushing
off
as
usual
it's
no
big
i
just
figured
i'd
hang
hereyou
know—until
my
roommate
goes
to
class
ah
i
see
i
know
it's
probably
just
me
having
a
bitch
attack
but
it's
not
me
buffy
living
with
somebody
is
never
easy
especially
for
an
only
child
giles
listen
to
me
ok
when
she
sharpens
her
pencils
she
measures
them
with
a
ruler
to
make
sure
they're
all
the
same
size
which
is
fussy
i
agree
but
everybody
has
their
idiosyncrasies
you'd
do
well
to
learn
to
tolerate
them
or
i'll
end
up
an
old
lady
who
can
only
live
with
cats
something
like
that
buffy
ok
you
know
what
you're
right
take
a
mental
pic
this
is
the
new
buffy
kinder
gentler
roommate
extraordinaire
exboyfriend
or
loan
shark
excuse
me
the
person
you're
hiding
from
oh
both
ugly
breakup
i'm
sorry
i
just
cut
you
no
stay
stay
i'll
watch
your
back
freshman
huh
is
it
that
obvious
there
are
signs
for
instance
people
who've
been
around
for
awhile
know
how
to
use
their
dining
hall
card
it's
not
for
food
work
it
right
and
you
can
get
three
meals
worth
which
equals
fewer
punch
cards
used
annually
and
more
cash
from
dad
which
you
get
to
keep
for
yourself
right
the
goal
is
to
polish
off
as
much
as
humanly
possible
at
one
sitting
enough
to
get
you
through
the
rest
of
the
day
if
necessary
while
chipmunking
items
for
future
consumption
ahh
got
it
excess
dry
goods
fit
nicely
in
a
backpack
or
your
pocket
the
wetter
itemsmacaronies
your
turkey
loafthen
you're
into
ziplocks
it's
not
for
beginners
i'll
just
take
it
slow
so
so
those
are
my
are
you
oh
no
i
have
someone
waiting
otherwise
i'd
heh
uh
parker
abrams
i'm
at
kresge
hall
buffy
summers
stevenson
ok
well
i'll
see
you
around
buffy
summers
of
stevenson
see
ya
parker
abrams
hey
say
hi
to
noncollege
guy
not
that
i
mind
but
don't
noncollege
guys
usually
populate
the
noncampus
usually
i
just
thought
i'd
come
around
and
check
on
my
girls
and
eat
off
my
plate
what's
the
deal
xand
parents
not
feeding
you
sure
they
do
for
a
price
so
spill
what
was
that
all
about
with
the
cutie
patootie
i
don't
know
nothing
big
i
think
just
random
adorableness
oh
a
technique
i
know
well
hit
the
girl
with
your
best
shot
then
hasta
gotta
respect
the
driveby
low
rejection
fond
memories
it
looked
like
more
than
that
to
me
he
got
all
googlyeyed
that's
because
he
got
hit
by
the
buffinator
now
he's
powerless
you
think
no
question
he'll
be
back
so
what
else
is
up
with
the
buff
any
vamp
action
i
did
get
jumped
by
a
demon
of
nonspecific
origin
last
night
yeah
something
apocalypsey
do
we
need
to
assemble
the
scooby
gang
no
but
thank
you
for
asking
i
just
got
way
too
excited
didn't
i
you
just
need
to
get
out
of
the
basement
a
little
more
there
xand
hi
everybody
squeeze
in
you
all
know
my
roomie
kathy
hi
hey
kath
is
that
my
sweater
i
didn't
think
you'd
mind
i
mean
you
got
mine
all
muddy
i
was
saving
you
from
a
bear
mugger
it's
not
a
problem
is
it
i
mean
i
figured
we're
almost
like
sisters
now
living
together
and
everything
no
it's
it's
fine
i
just
wished
you'd
asked
so
where're
you
from
kathy
nebraska
originally
ahh
yes
big
sky
country
i
mean
can
you
believe
her
first
she
acts
like
she
has
sit
privileges
at
my
lunch
table
just
because
some
computer
had
to
make
us
cellmates
i'm
sure
it's
not
easy
for
her
she's
not
like
you
she
doesn't
know
anybody
here
fine
but
what
about
my
sweater
you
can't
believe
the
stuff
that
i
have
to
put
up
with
yeah
i
guess
it's
hard
uh
but
i'm
sure
the
sweater
thing
was
an
accident
i
don't
know
will
i
think
she's
just
coming
back
from
the
bathroom
i'll
call
you
back
don't
forget
to
log
those
calls
ewww
who
left
their
gum
here
gum
gnome
it
wasn't
me
it
had
to
be
somebody
buffy
i
don't
know
do
you
always
make
that
noise
when
you
sleep
so
then
after
the
scorpion
the
demon
opened
my
mouth
and
sucked
some
kind
of
weird
light
out
of
me
aand
the
worst
part
i
wake
up
and
there's
kathy
staring
at
me
like
i'm
some
kind
of
freak
well
actually
the
worst
part
i'd
have
to
go
with
the
demon
poring
the
blood
down
your
throat
me
too
i
would
vote
for
that
too
but
that's
just
a
dream
and
this
kathy
thing
is
real
all
she
cared
about
was
that
her
precious
sleep
had
been
disturbed
perhaps
it
would
be
more
productive
to
examine
your
dreams
um
determine
there
meaning
you
can
read
dreams
neat
giles
kathy
kathy
giles
he's
our
grownup
friend
nnot
in
a
creepy
way
nice
to
meet
you
kathy
ditto
maybe
you
could
read
the
dream
i
had
last
night
there
was
like
this
monster
and
he
sat
on
me
and
did
all
this
stuff
to
me
stuff
like
scorpions
and
bloody
mary
minus
the
mary
that's
it
how'd
you
know
well
i'm
a
good
guesser
me
too
and
i'm
guessing
that
you
need
to
be
on
your
way
to
class
right
kath
hmm
hmm
sounds
like
somebody
woke
up
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
bed
this
morning
hmm
hmm
and
guess
what
you
were
next
to
it
you
know
i
do
need
to
dash
my
whole
schedule
is
off
because
someone
kept
me
up
all
night
well
it's
been
fun
toodles
toodles
you
know
what
this
means
yes
not
only
does
she
take
my
sweater
but
now
she
has
to
horn
in
on
my
dreams
she
is
the
most
ever
mooch
oh
i
haven't
even
gotten
to
the
floss
buffy
focus
please
if
kathy
and
you
are
having
the
same
nightmares
chances
are
something
happened
to
you
both
when
you
met
the
demon
in
the
woods
so
we
need
to
figure
out
if
this
ritual
their
dreaming
about
has
some
special
use
or
meaning
cool
you
guys
can
do
the
brain
thing
i'm
gonna
go
to
class
which
could
also
be
construed
as
the
brain
thing
not
when
you're
minoring
in
'napping
101'
ok
so
that
was
the
evil
twin
right
'cause
she
was
bordering
on
cordeliaesque
well
she's
definitely
pushing
the
stress
meter
on
this
kathy
thing
i
concur
she's
not
uh
herself
but
you
know
uh
learning
to
live
with
someone
can
be
a
challenge
aand
she
hasn't
been
sleeping
right
then
nothing
to
get
to
concerned
about
still
let
me
know
if
she
um
hits
the
red
zone
yes
we
were
correct
she
is
the
one
good
i
have
prepared
for
the
summoning
of
the
great
one
taparrich
lots
of
popular
artists
don't
get
their
dues
madonna
whitney
that's
so
totally
true
parker
hey
uh
i
just
dropped
by
to
say
that
uh
and
bring
you
you
know
to
maximize
your
dining
hall
exports
they're
heavy
duty
plus
freezer
guard
that's
so
parker
was
just
going
to
leave
his
number
and
go
but
we
started
talking
he's
such
a
blast
and
time
just
flew
time
really
how
much
time
uh
i'm
not
sure
we
sort
of
got
caught
up
talking
red
wings
it
turns
out
that
kathy's
a
closet
hockey
fan
i
think
it's
the
violence
quit
it
i
told
you
that
was
just
between
us
it
could
be
the
sweaty
men
if
you
two
are
going
to
rassle
do
you
mind
taking
it
outside
i've
got
a
lot
of
work
to
do
sorry
i
didn't
realize
oh
parker
wait
look
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
mean
to
no
it's
totally
cool
i
should
go
anyway
well
it
was
great
of
you
to
stop
by
mmaybe
we
could
do
it
another
time
another
time
for
sure
bye
kathy
bye
seeya
it
wouldn't
have
killed
you
to
be
nice
you
know
looked
like
you
were
being
nice
enough
for
the
both
of
us
i
wasn't
moving
in
on
your
territory
if
that's
what
you
mean
right
just
like
you
didn't
destroy
my
sweater
i'm
cold
well
i'm
hot
deal
with
it
do
you
know
what
your
problem
is
buffy
you
hardly
your
problem
is
you're
spoiled
maybe
the
world
revolved
around
you
where
you
used
to
live
but
it's
share
time
now
share
time
huh
fine
i'll
show
you
share
time
you're
worried
about
her
yeah
both
of
them
i
mean
what
kind
of
demon
runs
around
putting
ookie
blood
dreams
into
people's
heads
like
some
kind
of
nightmare
fairy
it's
not
right
well
i'm
against
it
and
buffy's
completely
being
not
herself
if
it
wasn't
for
this
english
paper
i'd
be
there
right
now
um
listening
doing
the
girly
best
friend
thing
well
i
can
do
that
you
can
well
i'm
not
saying
we'll
braid
each
others
hairprobably—but
i
can
hang
with
her
watch
for
signs
she's
going
over
the
edge
you're
the
best
oh
she's
probably
patrolling
by
now
check
around
the
science
center
if
you
need
me
i'll
be
at
the
library
so
then
kathy's
like
'it's
share
time'
and
i'm
like
'oh
yeah
share
this'
so
either
you
hit
her
or
you
did
your
wacky
mime
routine
for
her
well
i
didn't
do
either
actually
but
she
deserves
it
don't
you
think
nobody
deserves
a
mime
buffy
hmm
kathy
does
she
deserves
to
be
locked
in
an
invisible
box
and
blown
away
by
an
imaginary
wind
and
and
forced
to
wear
a
binding
unitard
yeah
the
itchy
kind
it's
perfect
just
here
to
help
which
i
appreciate
but
you've
never
come
on
routine
patrol
with
me
before
oz
so
what's
the
deal
seemed
more
interesting
than
homework
as
long
as
it's
an
elective
i
can
handle
myself
alone
you
know
not
in
question
good
so
then
i
go
into
the
refrigeratorrightand
the
label
queen
has
managed
to
put
just
a
just
a
thought
buffy
but
do
you
think
all
this
ranting
is
scaring
away
potential
demons
you're
right
ooh
she's
even
affecting
my
work
now
she's
the
titanic
she's
a
crawling
black
cancer
she's
other
really
bad
things
on
the
plus
side
you've
killed
the
bench
which
was
looking
shifty
this
isn't
funny
oz
something
has
to
be
done
agreed
i'm
going
to
bed
oh
jeez
i
do
what
i
can
but
buffy's
difficult
she's
secretive
for
one
thing
she
comes
in
at
all
hours
of
the
night
she
leaves
her
gum
all
over
the
place
iit
sounds
like
things
are
rough
but
don't
you
want
to
be
talking
to
buffy
about
this
i
would
but
she
is
so
touchy
about
all
kinds
of
weird
stuff
i
mean
sometimes
i
get
the
feeling
that
she
is
not
quite
normal
you
know
well
normal
is
relative
right
later
ok
why
were
you
talking
to
her
buffy
come
on
we
were
only
just
saying
hi
yeah
that's
what
she
wants
you
to
think
buffy
this
has
to
stop
i
mean
ii
get
it
i
have
a
sucky
roomie
too
but
you
just
have
to
deal
you're
right
i've
been
thinking
a
lot
about
this
and
it's
clear
to
me
now
good
that's
better
kathy's
evil
i'm
an
evil
fighter
it's
simple
i'm
gonna
have
to
kill
her
you
have
to
kill
her
don't
you
think
you
could
just
switch
rooms
or
something
well
i
would
but
it's
not
just
me
in
danger
from
kathy
look
toenails
evil
toenails
i
took
them
off
the
floor
last
night
when
she
was
in
the
bathroom
she
thought
i
was
asleep
good
thinking
'cause
in
the
middle
of
the
night
those
toenails
could
have
attacked
you
and
left
little
halfmoon
marks
all
over
your
body
don't
be
ridiculous
the
point
is
i
measured
them
before
i
fell
asleep
and
again
this
morning
and
they
grew
after
they
were
cut
that's
a
demon
thing
she
has
to
be
eliminated
of
course
iit
makes
sense
now
but
you
better
show
those
bad
puppies
to
giles
before
you
do
anything
just
to
be
sure
absolutely
i
don't
want
to
do
anything
crazy
uh
you
hurry
on
to
giles
i'll
hang
here
andand
keep
an
eye
on
kathy
great
good
thanks
will
giles
ii
just
talked
to
buffy
and
yeah
i
think
she's
feeling
a
little
insane
no
nnot
bitchy
crazy
more
like
homicidal
maniac
crazy
so
i
told
her
to
come
to
you
kay
giles
anybody
home
hello
what
are
you
guys
doing
this
is
this
is
ridiculous
buffy
this
hurts
me
more
than
it
hurts
you
not
yet
but
it
will
don't
say
that
oh
please
don't
say
that
we're
doing
this
to
stop
you
from
making
a
terrible
mistake
clearly
something
is
amiss
yeah
something's
amiss
here
a
'miss
kathy
newman'
giles
ow
giles
look
in
my
bag
look
in
the
bottom
pocket
of
my
bag
she
has
parts
that
can
grow
after
they're
detached
she
irons
her
jeans
she's
evil
she
has
to
be
destroyed
i
fear
the
demon
that
buffy
met
in
the
woods
has
somehow
possessed
her
lite
fm
love
songs
nothing
but
love
songs
you
think
um
you
stay
and
watch
her
ii
know
a
spell
that
will
make
the
possessing
demon
reveal
itself
so
that
we
can
fight
it
but
ii
need
to
get
some
supplies
from
the
magic
shop
buffy
i
see
you
around
can
i
come
in
sure
where's
buffy
i
don't
know
exactly
but
i've
been
thinking
it
might
be
a
good
idea
for
you
and
buffy
to
give
each
other
some
apart
time
in
fact
you
might
want
to
be
uh
apart
before
she
gets
back
what
do
you
mean
i
should
leave
the
room
why
should
i
go
iit's
not
fair
i
know
you
bet
it's
not
fair
having
to
live
with
someone
who's
obviously
troubled
someone
who
so
clearly
needs
to
be
in
a
home
not
in
a
dorm
i
don't
know
about
that
uh
buffy's
going
through
something
yes
but
i
wouldn't
put
it
past
her
to
drop
out
or
take
off
or
something
do
something
horrible
to
herself
herself
or
worse
she's
capable
of
it
you
know
you
can
see
it
in
those
shifty
little
eyes
of
hers
one
of
these
days
she
might
even
push
somebody
too
far
hello
it's
oz
hi
you
did
she's
at
giles
uh
ok
you
know
during
that
really
short
phone
call
i
realized
you
are
so
right
i
mean
it's
not
fair
to
make
you
leave
your
own
room
so
you're
good
you
just
stay
right
there
kay
i
can't
believe
this
after
all
that
we've
been
through
together
and
you
guys
won't
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
kathy
is
bad
we
want
to
buff
it's
just
shh
don't
engage
i
don't
know
if
i
tightened
those
ropes
enough
then
we'd
better
go
over
there
and
check
'em
oh
dear
god
avoid
the
legs
avoid
the
legs
nope
not
tight
enough
kathy
buffy
i
think
we
need
to
talk
don't
you
absolutely
let's
talk
oops
look
what
i
did
huh
look
what
i
did
i
knew
it
where
is
she
quit
it
i
knew
it
i
knew
you
were
one
of
those
demon
things
oh
why
don't
you
just
stuff
it
and
let
me
finish
my
ritual
ritual
'the
ritual
of
mok'tagar
a
race
of
transdimensional
demons
involves
the
forced
ingestion
of
animal
blood
while
the
victim
slumbers'
buffy's
nightmares
were
real
i'm
sorry
ok
i
left
my
dimension
to
go
to
college
and
they
sent
these
guys
after
me
'but
while
the
mok'tagar
can
assume
many
forms
and
guises
including
human
they
can
always
be
recognized
by
others
of
their
kind
due
to
the
lack
of
a
soul'
so
i'm
borrowing
yours
without
even
asking
tonight
when
they
come
looking
for
me
they'll
take
the
one
without
a
soul
well
thank
god
i
won't
have
to
watch
you
floss
anymore
and
i
won't
have
to
live
with
a
slob
it's
share
time
buffy
fine
let's
start
with
my
sweater
oh
oow
why
couldn't
giles
have
shackles
like
any
selfrespecting
bachelor
guys
i
just
saw
kathy
and
she's
acting
oh
my
god
are
you
ok
yeah
buffy's
got
a
pretty
good
lead
on
us
though
ii'll
call
kathy
tell
her
to
get
out
of
there
all
you
had
to
do
was
write
down
your
calls
no
answer
toenails
buffy
was
right
kathy's
toenails
not
only
keep
growing
after
they've
been
cut
they
actually
regenerate
after
they've
been
destroyed
and
that's
a
demon
thing
oh
unequivocally
yes
so
where
is
buffy
oh
dear
we
have
even
less
time
than
i
feared
i've
looked
up
all
known
regenerating
demons
only
one
species
practices
the
ritual
buffy's
been
seeing
in
her
sleep
it's
used
to
steal
the
soul
from
a
human
body
wwait
are
you
saying
that
buffy's
been
doing
a
linda
blair
on
us
because
kathy's
been
sucking
her
soul
i
believe
so
yes
excuse
me
please
so
buffy
was
right
all
along
later
on
big
remorse
now
i've
found
a
spell
that
should
reverse
the
soul
transfer
procedure
immediately
willow
and
i
will
perform
it
at
once
leaving
xander
and
me
to
help
buffy
in
the
flesh
'hear
me
elders
of
the
upper
reaches
elders
of
the
lower
reaches
elders
of
the
dry
land
elders
of
the
river
flats'
ahhah
do
you
mind
people
are
trying
to
study
'ancients
i
beseech
you
the
soul
abstracted
let
it
revert
to
it's
true
seat'
the
window's
open
happy
open
up
let
me
finish
'let
it
be
finished
let
the
unnatural
vessel
be
emptied
let
the
essence
be
returned
to
it's
original
host'
how
did
you
do
there
you
are
do
you
have
any
idea
how
much
trouble
you're
in
young
lady
i'm
not
going
back
don't
take
that
tone
with
me
i'm
3000
years
old
when
are
you
going
to
stop
treating
me
like
i'm
900
enough
you're
coming
home
how's
that
uhuh
a
little
to
the
left
there
perfect
i'm
so
glad
you're
here
will
i
can
already
feel
all
that
badkathykarma
just
draining
away
about
thatthe
kathy
thingi'm
sorry
i
doubted
you
you're
completely
forgiven
i
mean
you
had
reason
to
doubt
except
for
the
soul
sucking
thing
i
bet
kathy
was
pretty
regular
as
far
as
roomies
go
that's
a
pretty
big
'except'
i
guess
i'm
just
glad
that
it
was
kathy's
demony
ways
making
me
nofun
buffy
i've
always
thought
i
was
pretty
easy
goingyou
knowit's
not
like
i
have
the
big
issues
you
know
burn
incense
or
you
going
to
finish
this
