so
many
things
i
like
dawn
i
explained
this
to
you
willow
has
a
problem
the
next
few
weeks
are
gonna
be
crazy
hard
on
her
as
it
is
any
reminder
of
of
what
it
is
that
she's
trying
to
stay
away
from
you
know
could
cause
her
to
give
in
to
temptation
and
that
would
be
bad
okay
that's
it
it's
finally
done
i
mean
it
still
needs
a
trial
run
but
it's
kind
of
clunkylooking
what
i
pictured
something
cooler
more
ilm
less
ed
wood
you
wanna
see
cool
i'll
show
you
cool
mama
did
it
is
it
yeah
i'd
call
that
a
successful
test
well
that's
just
half
the
test
hey
hey
you
penis
oh
cheer
up
frodo
because
thanks
to
my
brains
and
our
mystical
gem
we
got
ourselves
an
invisibility
ray
and
i'd
say
that
makes
us
pretty
much
unstoppable
dawn
come
on
you
gotta
eat
breakfast
xander's
gonna
be
here
any
second
she's
gonna
be

face
the
world'
okay

poop
on
the
uh
stolen
diamond
i
called
you
before

nice
omelet
not
hungry
dawn
you

something
thanks

your
concern
okay
i
deserve
the
wrath
of
dawn
but
why
is
she
taking
it
out
on
you
because
i
let
it
happen

willow
she

she

of
lives

another
woman
oh
oh
it's
not
a
a
gay
thing
you
know
i
mean
well
she's
gay
but
but
we
don't
gay
not
that
there's
anything

oh
wrong
with
you
know
i
know
what
that
looks
like
but
i
i
swear
it's
not
what
it
looks
like
it's
magic
weed
it's
not
mine
i
think
i've
seen
enough
no
aactually
i
really
don't
think
that
you
have
it's
just
iit's
been
kind
of
kind
of
a
a
bad
time
it's
been
a
bad
time
now
for
a
while
hasn't
it
ms
summers
your
sister's
grades
have
fallen
sharply
in
the
last
year
due
in
large
part
to
her
frequent
absences
and
lateness
but
therethere
are
good
reasons
oh
i'm
sure
there
are
but
my
interest
is
in
dawn's
welfare
and
the
stability
of
her
home
life
something
i'm
just
not
convinced
that
an
unemployed
young
woman
like
yourself
can
provide
i
can
i
i
do
well
we'll
just
have
to
see
about
that
then
won't
we
oh
and
i'm
uh
going
to
recommend
immediate
probation
in
my
report
what
does
that
mean
it
means
that
i'll
be
monitoring
you
very
closely
ms
summers
and
if
i
don't
see
that
things
are
improving
well
i'll
be
forced
to
recommend
that
you
be
stripped
of
your
sister's
guardianship
you
can't
do
that
i
do
what
is
in
dawn's
best
interest
as
should
you
have
a
nice
day
didn't
go
well
huh
why
won't
you

thought
you'd
want
get

make
me
different
i'm
scared
what
if
we
get
caught
no
way
we'll
be
invisible
plus
their
security's
gotten
lax
you
should
know
you've
cased
this
joint
enough
okay
this
is
it
remember
we're
professionals
uh

xander
sorry

a
marcie
deal
i
don't

what
happened
i
left
main
street
after
getting
my
hair
cut
and
you
cut
your
hair
oh
yeah
really
how
short
um
about
up
to
here
well
if
you
could
see
my
hand
it's
kind
of
above
my
shoulders
ahh
that
sounds
so
adorable
i
was
thinking
about
getting
my
hair
cut
before
the
wed
can
we
get
back
to
freaking
out
about
noshow
buffy
this
is
serious
i
know
it
kind
of
fits
the
day
i've
had
willow's
still
a
wreck
dawn's
mad
at
both
of
us
and
the
social
services
lady
put
me
through
a
wringer
says
she's
gonna
watch
me
i'd
like
to
see
her
try
now
you
know
there
may
be
an
upside
to
noseeme
buff
did
you
say
anyone
or
anything
suspicious
before
you
cleared
out
nope
didn't
see
nothin'
see
what
i
did
there
with
the
eyeballs
why
would
anyone
make
her
invisible
anyway
i
mean
invisible
slayer's
gotta
be
way
more
effective
than
the
standard
variety
yeah
i'm
less
with
the
why
and
more
with
the
how
we
get
the
how
then
we
got
how
to
make
her
unseen
sight
seen
again
right
'saright
buffy
could
you
focus
please
i
am
just
this
is
kind
of
fun
well
it
would
help
if
we
had
a
little
bit
more
to
go
on
or
anything
to
go
on
well
i
could
go
check
the
spot
where
buffy
disappeared
snoop
for
clues
yeah
right
uh
hey
you
know
what
i'm
just
gonna
go
for
a
walk
a
walk
yeah
um
clear
my
head
you
guys
keep
working
on
those
whats
and
hows
clear
my
head
buffy
well
seems
pretty
obvious
it's
some
kind
of
spell
that's
done
this
to
her
spell
from
who
you
said
it
yourself
it
makes
no
sense
for
one
of
her
enemies
to
make
her
invisible
maybe
it's
a
mistake
a
magical
mistake
who'd
be
messing
with
that
kind
of
pow
willow
xander
how's
it
going
um
good
i
i
uh
found
out
some
stuff
about
the
diamond
stolen
from
the
museum
it's
called
the
illuminata
and
there's
rumors
of
it
having
quasimystical
quantum
properties
willow
we
need
to
talk
we
are
talking
well
i'm
talking
and
you're
looking
at
me
funny
is
there
something
you
wanna
tell
me
it
was
nothing
i
ii
didn't
slip
will
nobody's
mad
relapse
is
a
part
of
recovery
we
understand
that
we
just
have
to
figure
a
way
to
fix
it
fix
what
fix
buffy
buffy's
broken
will
you
know
what
i'm
talki

you
don't
know
rhymes
with
'blinvisible'
what
buffy
was
in
town
leaving
the
haircutting
place
when
she
suddenly
just
buffy
got
her
hair
cut
yeah
adorable
apparently
i
personally
couldn't
tell
since
she's
all
'blinvisible'
and
you
think
i
had
something
to
do
with
this
uh
no
not

well
come
on
will
some
of
the
spells
you've
done
have
caused
some
weird
stuff
to
happen
to
each
of
us
at
one
time
or
another
and
let's
not
forget
the
recent
forgetting
oh
i
see
so
now
when
anything
nasty
happens
i
get
conveniently
blamed
for
it
no
one's
blaming
so
i
guess
it
wouldn't
matter
if
i
just
jump
off
the
wagon
completely
since
you
already
think
i'm
making
pit
stops
well
look
if
you
said
you
didn't
do
it

willow
where
you
going
for
a
walk
couple
of
circuits
are
burned
out
and
the
wiring's
all
fried
but
we
had
so
many
plans
naked
women
and
all
well
allall
the
naked
women
this
is
all
your
fault
if
you
hadn't
grabbed
it
from
me
hey
we
got
a
lot
bigger
problems
here
bonehead
the
slayer's
invisible
now
he's
right
she
could
be
anywhere
even
here
right
now
watching
listening
to
every
word
we
say
for
all
we
know
she
could
be
one
of
us
oh
wait
no
guys
that
isn't
true
i
wouldn't
sweat
the
slayer
too
much
says
you
in
my
book
an
invisible
slayer
means
a
whole
world
of
trouble
i
am
the
ghost
of
fashion
victims

studded
caps

gotta
know
i
don't
think
buffy's
gonna
be
too
broken
up
over
a
pylon
anya
whatever's
happening
to
the
pylon
will
probably
happen
to
her
if
we
don't
find
buffy
ii
mean
if
we
don't
figure
out
how
this
was
done
she's
pudding
what
do
you
mean
she's
gonna
fade
away
the
slayer
got
slammed
with
a
bigass
dose
of
radiation
when
the
gun
overloaded
her
cells
are
mutating
at
an
accelerated
rate
eventually
her
molecular
makeup
will
start
losing
its
integrity
and
then
pfft
but
wouldn't
that
kill
her

lemme
think

not
killing
anybody

are
you
gonna
get
that
through
your
thick
skulls

crime
lords
yeah
like
like
lex
luthor
he's
always
trying
to
take
over
metropolis
but
he
doesn't
kill
superman
because
it's
superman's
book

lex
doesn't
kill
him

crowded
area

you're

ionization
it'll

we're
your
archnemesises
ses
you

you
mean
it's
locked
you
were
supposed
to
check
it
i
forgot
i
give
you
my
arch
nemesisesses
what's
going
on
in
here
i
got
a
bunch
of
scared
kids
saying
this
place
is
haunted
oh
my
god
buffy
i
know
they're
gone
i
guess
we
should
chase
them
no
your
hair
it
is
adorable
pretty
neat
you
finding
the
van
so
how
did
you
manage
to
do
it
exactly
i
mean
to
locate
it
the
hard
way
the
spellfree
way
the
ohmygodmyhead'sgonnafalloff
myfeetarekillingme
way
i
don't
know
how
i
got
through
this
day
well
the
important
thing
is
that
you
did
it's
a
good
first
step
how
are
you
doing
postinvisibleness
okay
i
still
have
to
do
some
damage
control
from
my
giddyfest
dawn
was
pretty
freaked
out
the
whole
takingavacationfromme
thing
didn't
work
out
so
well
tell
me
about
it
except
when
i
got
xander's
message
you
know
that
i
was
fading
away
i
actually
got
scared
well
yeah
who
wouldn't
me
i
wouldn't
not
too
long
ago
i
probably
would
have
welcomed
it
but
i
realized
i'm
not
saying
that
i'm
doing
backflips
about
my
life
but
i
didn't
i
don't
wanna
die
that's
something
right
it's
something
so
i
guess
we
both
made
good
first
steps
i
guess
yay
for
us
yay
joss
whedon
and
marti
noxon
