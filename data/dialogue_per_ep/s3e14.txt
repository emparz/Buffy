so
what
you're
telling
me
never
faith
really
now
is
not
the
time
i'm
curious
never
ever
come
on
really
all
this
time
and
not
even
once
how
many
times
do
i
have
to
say
it
i
have
never
done
it
with
xander
he's
just
a
friend
so
what
are
friends
for
i
mean
i'm
sorry
it's
just
all
this
sweatingnightly
sidebyside
action
and
you
never
put
in
for
a
little
afterhours

thanks
for
the
poetry
and
no
i
love
xander
i
just
don't
love
xander
besides
i
think
it
ruins
friendship
to
do
that
stuff
you
think
too
much
hey
there's
one
more
how
do
you
know
i
think
too
much
okay
count
of
three
one
three
nicely
diverted
b
diverted
that
was
me
fighting
for
my
life
miss
attention
span
this
isn't
a
tupperware
party
it's
a
little
hard
to
plan
the
count
of
three
isn't
a
plan
it's
sesame
street
hey
they're
toast
and
we're
here
so
it
couldn't
have
been
too
bad
right
who
were
those
guys
anyways
i
don't
know
they
didn't
seem
local
look
why
don't
we
grab
the
weapons
maybe
giles
check
these
out
i
i
just
love
the
family
circus
that
pj
he's
getting
to
be
quite
a
handful
well
i
haven't
seen
anything
like
this
in
uh
well
a
good
long
while
where's
the
owner
of
these
fine
implements
the
common
term
is
'slain'
but
i've
been
seeing
this
breed
around
are
we
expecting
any
trouble
do
you
like
family
circus
i
like
marmaduke
oh
eww
he's
always
on
the
furniture
unsanitary
nobody
can
tell
marmaduke
what
to
do
that's
my
kinda
dog
i
like
to
read
cathy
so
uh
what
abbout
these
swords
wwhat
should
we
do
about
that
well
let's
just
keep
an
eye
out
we've
got
the
dedication
coming
up
in
a
few
days
we
certainly
can't
have
anything
interfering
with
that
well
maybe
we
should
postpone
the
thethe
dedication
i
believe
the
honorable
mayor
hates
that
idea
the
dedication
is
the
final
step
before
my
ascension
i
have
waited
longer
than
you
can
imagine
for
this
after
the
hundred
days
i'll
be
on
a
higher
plane
and
i'll
have
no
more
need
for
well
let's
just
say
i
won't
be
concerned
with
the
little
things
mr
trick
watch
these
people
anything
you
find
out
about
them
well
let's
just
see
that
that
information
reaches
the
slayers
who
knows
with
any
luck
they'll
kill
each
other
then
everyone's
a
winner
everyone
of
course
meaning
me
willow
what
are
these
they're
early
admission
packets
harvard
yale
wesleyan
some
german
polytechnical
institute
whose
name
i
uh
i
can't
pronounce
is
anyone
else
intimidated
'cause
i'm
just
expecting
thin
slips
of
paper
with
the
words
'no
way'
written
in
crayon
they're
typing
those
now
hmm
i'm
so
overwhelmed
ii
got
in
to
actual
colleges
the
wooing
stage
is
always
fun
but
it's
weird
now
rejection
i
can
handle
'cause
of
the
years
of
training
but
this
i
feel
your
pain
will
like
right
now
i'm
torn
between
the
fastgrowing
fields
of
appliance
repair
and
motel
management
of
course
i'm
still
waiting
to
hear
back
from
the
uh
corndog
emporium
so
well
i
think
it's
great
early
admission
now
there's
nothing
standing
between
you
and
a
brilliant
future
well
if
i
may
suggest
graduate
gettin'
left
back
not
the
thrill
ride
you'd
expect
that's
so
cute
planning
life
as
a
loser
most
people
just
turn
out
that
way
but
you're
really
taking
charge
the
comedy
stylings
of
miss
cordelia
chase
everyone
who
uh
incidentally
won't
be
needing
a
higher
education
when
she
markets
her
own
very
successful
line
of
hooker
wear
well
xander
i
could
dress
more
like
you
but
oh
my
father
has
a
job
i'm
not
gonna
waste
the
perfect
comeback
on
you
now
but
don't
think
i
don't
have
it
oh
yes
its
time
will
come
so
life
beyond
high
school
anyone
please
chime
in
i
hear
it's
nice
and
a
place
i'll
never
go
if
i
don't
pass
mrs
taggart's
chemistry
test
tomorrow
oh
i
can
help
chemistry's
easy
it's
a
lot
like
witchcraft

my
house
tonight
i'm
there
oh
i
have
to
go

on
last
night's
patrol
oh
yeah
he
said
he
wanted
to
talk
to
you
what
about
is
he
okay
he's
looked
better
of
course
training
procedures
have
been
updated
quite
a
bit
since
your
day
much
greater
emphasis
on
field
work
really
oh
yes
not
all
books
and
theory
nowadays
i
have
in
fact
faced
two
vampires
myself
under
controlled
circumstances
of
course
well
no
danger
of
finding
those
here
vampires
controlled
circumstances
hello
buffy
well
hello
new
watcher
new
watcher
wesley
wyndampryce
it's
very
nice
to
meet
you
is
he
evil
evil
the
last
one
was
evil
oh
yes
gwendolyn
post
we
all
heard
no
mr
giles
has
checked
my
credentials
rather
thoroughly
and
phoned
the
council
but
i'm
glad
to
see
you're
on
the
ball
as
well
a
good
slayer
is
a
cautious
slayer
is
he
evil
not
in
the
strictest
sense
well
i'm
glad
that's
cleared
up
as
i'm
sure
none
of
us
is
anxious
to
waste
any
time
on
pleasantries
why
don't
you
tell
me
everything
about
last
night's
patrol
vampires
yes
killed
'em
anything
else
you
can
tell
me
uh
one
of
them
had
swords
i
don't
think
he
was
with
the
other
two
swords
swords
one
long
one
short
mmm
both
pointy
with
like
jewels
and
things
sounds
familiar
it
should
el
eliminati
fifteenth
century
fifteenth
century
duelist
cult
deadly
in
their
day
their
numbers
dwindled
in
later
centuries
due
to
an
increase
in
antivampire
activity
and
a
lot
of
pointless
dueling
they
eventually
became
the
acolytes
of
a
demon
called
balthazar
who
brought
them
to
the
new
world
specifically
here
you
seem
to
know
a
lot
about
them
i
didn't
get
this
job
because
of
my
looks
i
really
really
believe
that
i've
researched
this
town's
history
extensively
so
why
have
we
not
seen
them
before
this
they
were
driven
out
a
hundred
years
ago
happily
balthazar
was
killed
i
don't
know
by
whom
and
they're
back
'cause
balthazar
had
an
amulet
purported
to
give
him
strength
when
he
was
killed
it
was
taken
by
a
wealthy
landowner
named
i
don't
want
to
bore
you
with
the
details
a
little
bit
late
named
gleaves
it
was
buried
with
him
and
i
believe
the
few
remaining
eliminati
are
probably
looking
for
it
for
sentimental
value
aand
you
don't
think
that
this
uh
amulet
poses
any
threat
oh
no
not
at
all
nonetheless
we
may
as
well
keep
it
from
them
buffy
you
will
go
to
the
gleaves
family
crypt
tonight
and
fetch
the
amulet
i
will
are
you
not
used
to
being
given
orders
whenever
giles
sends
me
on
a
mission
he
always
says
'please'
and
afterwards
i
get
a
cookie
i
don't
feel
we're
getting
off
on
quite
the
right
foot
ah
this
is
perhaps
faith
new
watcher
new
watcher
screw
that
now
why
didn't
i
just
say
that
uh
buffy
would
you
i'll
see
if
i
can
get
her
back
don't
say
anything
terribly
interesting
while
i'm
gone
they'll
get
used
to
me
faith
wait
look
i
know
this
new
guy's
a
dork
but
well
i
have
nothing
to
follow
that
he's
pretty
much
just
a
dork
you're
actually
gonna
take
orders
from
him
that's
the
job
what
else
can
we
do
whatever
we
want
we're
slayers
girlfriend
the
chosen
two
why
should
we
let
him
take
all
the
fun
out
of
it
oh
that
would
be
tragic
taking
the
fun
out
of
slaying
stabbing
beheading
oh
like
you
don't
dig
it
i
don't
you're
a
liar
i've
seen
you
tell
me
staking
a
vamp
doesn't
get
you
a
little
bit
juiced
come
on
say
it
you
can't
fool
me
the
look
in
your
eyes
right
after
a
kill
you
just
get
hungry
for
more
you're
way
off
base
tell
me
that
if
you
don't
get
in
a
good
slaying
after
a
while
you
just
start
itching
for
some
vamp
to
show
up
so
you
can
give
him
a
good

again
with
the
grunting
you
realize
i'm
not
comfortable
with
this
hey
slaying's
what
we
were
built
for
if
you're
not
enjoying
it
you're
doing
something
wrong
what
about
the
assignment
tell
you
what
you
do
the
homework
and
i'll
copy
yours
strike
one
no
amulet
there
game
over
faith
what
are
you
doing
hiding
in
there
looking
for
the
amulet
wasn't
counting
on
the
special
guest
stars
six
against
one
hence
the
hiding
well
it's
six
against
two
now
so
come
on
wait
stop
think
no
no
no
it's
a
manhole
tight
space
no
escape
six
against
two
not
unlike
three
against
one
and
there
might
be
more
so
come
on
you're
just
gonna
go
down
there
that's
your
plan
who
said
i
had
a
plan
i
don't
know
how
many's
down
there
but
i
wanna
find
out
and
i'll
know
when
i
land
if

after
me
i
might
die

all
the
diaries

everything
knock
yourself
out

your
first
entry

to
get
to

her
mm
'her
abuse
of
the
english
language
is
such
that
i
understand
only
every
other
sentence'
oh
this
is
going
to
make
fascinating
reading
she
should
be
back
by
now
not
to
fret
my
mission
scenario
has
her
back
in
one
minute
shouldn't
be
any
trouble
we're
surrounded

noticed
that
too
lemme
go
let's
settle
this
honorably
well
then
let's
just
settle
it
buffy

son
of
a
bitch
i
hate
it
when
they
drown
me
b
gotta
go
we
came
for
the
amulet
tell
me
you
don't
get
off
on
this
it
didn't
suck
well
looks
authentic
enough
of
course
there
are
tests
to
be
made
before
actual
verification
how
about
verifying
that
your
'nearly
extinct'
cult
was
out
in
magnum
force
last
night
faith
and
i
got
into
a
serious
party
situation
are
you
alright
i
had
to
lather
rinse
and
repeat
about
five
million
times
to
get
the
sewer
out
of
my
hair
but
otherwise
i'm
of
the
good
thank
you
for
asking
perhaps
there
were
a
few
more
than
we'd
anticipated
but
i'd
expect
you
to
be
ready
for
anything
remember
the
three
key
words
for
any
slayer
preparation
preparation
that's
one
word
three
times
i
have
a
chem
test
so
sad
that
i'm
actually
happy
about
that
giles
we
need
to
talk
buffy
i
must
ask
you
to
remember
that
i
am
your
watcher
from
now
on
anything
you
have
to
say
about
slaying
you
will
say
to
me
we'll
talk
of
course
you're
not
helping
no
i
feel
just
sick
about
it
it
was
intense
it
was
like
i
just
let
go
and
became
this
force
i
just
didn't
care
anymore
yeah
i
know
what
that's
like
i
don't
think
you
can
it's
kind
of
a
slayer
thing
i
don't
even
think
i'm
explaining
it
well
you're
explaining
it
a
lot
though
alright
you
have
one
period
to
fill
out
your
test
booklets
periodic
charts
are
located
on
the
back
you're
on
the
honor
system
so
remember
no
talking
you
see
the
thing
was
faith
knew
i
didn't
even
wanna
go
down
there
ahem
ms
summers
you
have
one
hour
okay
so
the
best
part
buffy
test
you
know
remember
the
thing
you
didn't
come
over
to
study
for
right
got
it
sorry
okay
so
we're
down
there
in
the
sewers
and
faith
got
three
of
them
on
her
at
once
hey
whoa
can
we
resume
buffy's
'ode
to
faith'
later
like
when
i'm
not
actively
multiplechoicing
how
come
your
eye
twitches
every
time
i
say
faith's
name
what
no
it
doesn't
faith
cut
it
out
we
got
a
test
to
take
okay
and
i'm
highly
caffeinated
and
i'm
trying
to
concentrate
some
of
us
actually
care
about
school
you
know
hey
girlfriend
bad
time
no
shshe
can't
yyou
can't
can
you
what's
up
vampires
uh
faith
unless
there's
a
total
eclipse
in
the
next
five
minutes
it's
daylight
good
for
us
bad
for
them
found
a
nest
has
potential
rise
and
shine
people
it's
your
wakeup
call
she
burns
friends
like
a
piece
of
wood
when
buffy
reaches
angel
she
jumps
up
on
him
and
wraps
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
her
legs
around
his
hips
angel
supports
her
at
the
waist
hey
you're
not
leaving
are
you
and
she's
jealous
of
me
because
she
never
could
angel
i
saw
you
making
friends
them
hold
herself
up
without
a
spine
buffy
boys
i
like
you
and
she'll
look
me
up
when
she's
doing
fine
angel
reacts
in
his
usual
somber
way
buffy
hops
down
off
of
him
what's
the
matter
you're
not
afraid
of
little
me
are
ya
we
better
sit
down
come
on
i
can
sense
this
is
a
business
trip
what's
the
what
balthazar
dead
demon
not
as
dead
as
you
think
word
on
the
street
puts
him
in
the
packing
warehouse
on
devereau
he's
looking
for
his
amulet
it's
supposed
to
restore
his
strength
from
what
i'm
hearing
that's
not
something
we'd
like
to
see
happen
no
problem
we
got
the
amulet
i
know
i
spoke
to
giles
but
he
said
you
gave
it
to
someone
ah
there
you
are
ah
speak
of
the
really
annoying
person
you're
certainly
giving
me
a
run
for
my
money
i
think
we
ought
to
establish
that
if
you're
going
to
go
out
slaying
you
leave
me
a
number
where
i
can
contact
you
where's
the
amulet
who
are
you
a
friend
do
you
have
it
it's
somewhere
safe
how
did
you
know
it
pooches
your
jacket
now
hang
on
a
minute
walking
around
with
this
thing
is
like
wearing
a
target
you're
gonna
put
it
somewhere
safe
that's
actually
safe
yeah
i'll
do
it
now
i'll
do
some
recon
on
balthazar
if
i
may
balthazar
is
dead
am
i
the
only
one
that

know
me
i
mean

what's
going
on
call

me
tell
you
what
i
see
i
see
fear
and
remorse
and
the
pitiful
look
of
faces
that
cry
out
for
mercy
but
what
i
don't
see
is
what
i
want
to
see
and
that's
my
amulet

desperate
need

fast

little
more
firepower

into
my
liquor
cabinet
allan
don't
we
have
don't
we
have
security
working
in
this
building
sir
i
i
had
no
idea
ii
there's
no
need
to
swoon
allan
but
try
to
keep
things
secure
lock
him
up
he
wakes
up
he's
just
gonna
try
and
kill
you

yes
yes
i
expect
he
will
vincent
made
a
noble
effort
man
to
man
as
befits
a
true
warrior
he
had
courage
he
had
honor
and
i
have
jack
to
show
for
it
it's
been
a
hundred
years
since
my
enemy
crippled
me
now
ultimate
power
is
within
his
grasp
and
i
shall
not
mmm
you
like
it
it
smells
good
what
is
it
just
a
little
something
we
witches
like
to
call
a
protection
spell
good
deal
protection
i'm
surprised
though
'cause
usually
spell
stuff's
more
stinky
yeah
that's
why
i
added
lavender
give
me
time
and
i
may
be
the
first
wicca
to
do
all
my
conjuring
in
pine
fresh
scent
so
what's
the
plan
for
tonight's
slayage
we're
going
aren't
we
yeah
great
but
there's
a
'but'
and
that's
'but
you
shouldn't
come
tonight'
is
that
cool
well
sure
makes
sense
you
know
you'll
be
facing
big
hairy
danger
uh
bbiggest
and
very
hairy
you'll
be
risking
your
life
right
and
why
risk
yours
because
i'm
your
friend
i
know
will
and
that's
exactly
why
i
don't
want
you
going
but
ii've
done
this
sort
of
thing
before
like
a
million
times
and
i
can
totally
handle
myself
besides
minty
fresh
protection
so
ready
time
to
motor
hey
willow
hi
uh
i
really
should
but
we'll
hang
out
later
right
yeah
you
you
go
ahead
i'll
just
get
my
stuff
stupid
you're
quiet
tonight
i
just
wanna
get
this
done
yeah
i'm
dying
to
test
out
the
longbow
i
think
it
might
be
my
new
thing
i
can't
believe
you
went
back
for
that
stuff
hey
how
do
you
feel
about
getting
some
ribs
you
know
after
we're
done
i
didn't
say
you
had
emotional
problems
i
said
you
had
an
emotional
problem
it's
quite
different
my
'attachment'
to
the
slayer
is
not
a
problem
in
point
of
fact
it's
been
a
very
the
way
you've
handled
this
assignment
is
something
of
an
embarrassment
to
the
council
if
you
want
to
criticize
my
methods
fine
but
you
can
keep
your
snide
remarks
to
yourself
and
while
you're
at
it
don't
criticize
my
methods
the
fact
is
you're
no
longer
qualified
to
act
as
watcher
it's
not
your
fault
you've
done
well
it's
simply
time
for
somebody
else
to
take
the
field
now's
a
good
time
to
start
screw
it

think
we've
got
more
comin'

a
time
