this
matter
is
urgent
also
i'm
a
very
delicate
person
so
you
feel
you
can
handle
this
it's
a
little
out
of
my
element
but
i
can
get
you
what
you
need
i
know
a
beast
who
knows
a
guy
are
you
sure
that
subcontracting
is
the
way
to
go
here
well
this
guy's
worked
your
town
before
and
if
he
lives
up
to
his
rep
this
place'll
be
in
flames
i've
made
certain
deals
to
get
where
i
am
today
this
demon
requires
his
tribute
you
see
that's
what
separates
me
from
other
politicians
mr
trick
i
keep
my
campaign
promises
where'd
i
put
that
scotch
and

i
was
being

all
the
time
hello
buffy
do
you
guys
wanna
watch
some
television
i
hear
there's
a
very
insightful
nightline
on
buffy
you
lied
to
us
and
you
made
us
into
your
alibis
i
called
willow
you
also
lied
to
her
about
your
whereabouts
we
were
all
concerned
oh
thank
you
look
i'm
sorry
but
i
had
to
were
you
at
the
bronze
what
was
happening
there
that
was
so
important
bronze
things
things
of
bronze
you're
acting
really
immature
buffy
i
know
i'm
not
your
parent
but
i
am
responsible
for
you
i
think
your
mum's
right
okay
fine
i'm
acting
like
a
child
maybe
that's
because
you're
both
treating
me
like
a
child
buffy
you're
both
scheduling
me
twentyfour
hours
a
day
between
the
two
of
you
that's
fortyeight
hours
i
just
wanna
be
able
to
make
a
few
decisions
on
my
own
the
last
time
you
made
a
decision
on
your
own
you
split
yeah
and
i
took
care
of
myself
i
don't
need
this
much
active
parenting
you
can't
really
be
trying
to
use
this
summer
as
a
reason
you
should
be
trusted
you
can't
babysit
me
all
the
time
i
need
you
to
back
off
a
little
uh
alright
come
on
let's
let's
not
uh
freak
out
'freak
out'
mmhm
uh
i
think
you
should
go
to
bed
um
we're
all
tired
oh
she
just
drives
me
crazy
i
just
want
to
protect
her
don't
all
parents
want
that
yeah
but
at
least
most
parents
have
some
idea
what
to
protect
their
children
from
yeah
and
i
think
we
should
both
be
especially
careful
mm
trust
me
you
don't
want
to
eat
that
think
fast
i
heard
that
there
was
a
secret
rule
that
if
a
teacher's
more
than
ten
minutes
late
we
can
all
leave
it's
giles'
turn
to
watch
study
hall
he
is
wound
a
little
tight
i
had
this
philosophy
book
checked
out
from
the
library
for
like
a
year
and
he
made
me
pay
the
fine
even
though
it
was
huge
i
was
sad
to
return
it
it
was
perfect
for
starting
conversations
with
college
boys
of
course
that
was
bx
bx
before
xander
clever
i
like
chocolate
there
is
no
bad
here
you
still
have
some
left
i
went
to
like
four
houses
and
they
were
gone
it's
like
trickortreating
in
reverse
i
know
these
things
are
selling
like
hot
cakes
which
is
ironic
'cause
the
hot
cakes
really
aren't
moving
and
it's
uh
ahem
fun
to
sell
chocolate
ahem
and
we're
raising
a
lot
of
money
for
the
band
the
band
yeah
they're
great
they
march
like
an
army
eeexcept
with
music
instead
of
bullets
and
usually
no
one
dies
i
can't
believe
this
where
is
giles
already
i'm
bored
and
he's
not
here
to
give
me
credit
for
it
the
big
pinhead
librarian
didn't
show
up
and
i
don't
wanna
do
it
you
do
it
alright
fine
i'll
do
it
everybody
expects
me
to
do
everything
around
here
because
i'm
the
principal
it's
not
fair
hey
we're
all
stuck
here
okay
so
now
let's
just
sit
quietly
and
and
pretend
we're
reading
something
until
we're
really
sure
that
old
commandant
snyder's
gone
then
we're
all
outta
here
does
anyone
else
wanna
marry
ms
barton
get
in
line
i
guess
giles
isn't
coming
i
guess
not
buffy
uh
sorry
i
i
was
just
worried
you
were
a
big
notthere
in
study
hall
and
after
your
lecture
to
me
on
not
ducking
out
and
what
is
my
mother
doing
here
we
had
an
opportunity
for
um
you
might
say
a
summit
meeting
it
took
priority
over
study
hall
i
called
in
oh
we
decided
that
you
made
a
good
point
earlier
honey
i
did
yeah
which
was
aabout
us
overscheduling
you
pulling
you
in
two
directions
uh
your
home
life
and
your
duties
as
a
slayer
oh
that
was
a
good
point
we're
working
out
a
coordinated
schedule
for
you
it'll
be
tight
but
uh
i
think
we
can
fit
in
all
your
responsibilities
sounds
nice
and
structured
we've
got
more
work
to
do
here
honey
why
don't
you
give
us
a
little
more
time
um
take
the
car
and
um
mr
giles
can
drive
me
home

excuse
me
i
meant
what
keys

them
you
don't
have
to
tell
me
twice
well

my
mom

be
treated
more
like

voila
driviness
also
i
think
she
wanted
me
otherwhere
considering
my
mom

the

what

you
wanna

this
book
is
really
thick
and
i'm
not
sure
it's
in
english
where
bloody
hell
that's
what
smoking
will
do
to
you
now
be
quiet
well
where'd
the
bastard
go
shh
what
look
a
box
full
of
farmfresh
chicken
do
you
suppose
they're
okay
mmhm
so
are
you
two
kinda
like
um
goin'
steady
so
ethan
what
are
we
playing
we're
pretty
much
in
a
talkor
bleed
situation
your
call
hit
him
ii'd
just
like
to
point
out
that
this
wasn't
my
idea
meaning
i'm
subcontracting
it's
trick
you
want
i'm
just
helping
him
collect
a
tribute
for
a
demon
he's
lying
hit
him
i
don't
think
he
is
and
shut
up
you're
my
slayer
go
knock
his
teeth
down
his
thr
giles
what
demon
i
don't
remember
yes
lurconis
demon
named
lurconis
they
wanted
a
way
to
get
the
tribute
away
from
people
so
you're
just
diversion
guy
more
than
a
diversion
well
they
said
the
tribute
was
big
so
big
that
people
would
never
let
them
take
it
that
people
had
to
be
out
ofit
and
later
on
when
the
candy
wore
off
they'd
blame
themselves
hence
land
of
the
irresponsible
so
where's
trick
i
don't
know
exactly
hit
him
again
no
iii
really
don't
know
which
brings
us
to
the
bonus
question
and
believe
me
when
i
say
a
wrong
answer
will
cost
you
all
your
points
what's
the
tribute
right
lurconis
lurconis
a
demon
what's
his
deal
see
if
it
says
anything
about
a
tribute

planned
where's
the
downside

yourself
one
less
demon
you
have
to
pay
tribute
to
the
way
i
see
it
i
did
you

be
very
careful

some
fun
friday
night
have
you
come
down
yet
that's
'principal
snyder'

a
big
'yep'

like
four
young
people
with
too
much
time
on
your
hands
not
really
busy
like
a
bee
actually
beelike
good
it
seems
we
had
some
vandalism
friday
on
school
property
and
i
was
just
looking
for
some
volunteers
to
help
clean
it
up
'kiss
rocks'
why
would
anyone
want
to
kiss
oh
wait
i
get
it
let's
get
you
some
paint
remover
it
was
just
too
much
to
deal
with
it
was
like
nothing
made
sense
anymore
the
things
that
i
thought
i
understood
were
gone
i
just
felt
so
alone
was
that
the
math
or
the
verbal
mostly
the
math
well
if
you
scored
low
then
you
can
take
them
again
more
sats
is
there
really
a
point
i
could
die
before
i
even
apply
to
college
and
then
you
very
possibly
might
not
well
let's
just
keep
hope
alive
hello
hi
i
say
your
car
seems
to
have
had
an
adventure
doesn't
it
uh
buffy
assures
me
that
it
happened
battling
evil
so
i'm
letting
her
pay
for
it
on
the
installment
plan
uh
hey
the
way
things
were
going
be
glad
that's
the
worst
that
happened
at
least
i
got
to
the
two
of
you
before
you
actually
did
something
right
indeed
