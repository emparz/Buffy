'one
night
after
supper
the
lead
dog
turned
up
a
snowshoe
rabbit
the
dog
lay
down
low
to
the
race
his
body
flashing
forward
leap
by
leap'
cut
to
the
library
buffy's
voice
dissolves
into
that
of
willow
who
is
walking
around
the
area
by
the
cage
while
reading
from
the
book
'he
was
sounding
the
deeps
of
his
nature
and
the
parts
of
his
nature
that
were
deeper
than
he
going
back
into
the
wombs
of
time
the
rabbit
could
not'
suddenly
werewolf
oz
leaps
up
against
the
cage
door
and
rattles
it
at
her
she
startles
and
steps
back
okay
uh
maybe
we
should
try
a
less
stimulating
passage
private
harris
reporting
for
oz
watch
xander
oh
good
oh
'call
of
the
wild'
aren't
we
reading
the
cliff
notes
to
this
for
english
some
of
us
are
anyway
it'll
help
you
stay
awake
it's
good
and
and
very
wolfy
seems
to
soothe
the
savage
beast
except
for
the
parts
about
rabbits
rabbis
it
seems
to
make
him
a
little
overexcited
okay
now
he's
had
his
200
feeding
and
uh
after
sunrise
if
he
forgets
where
his
clothes
are
they're
on
top
of
the
file
cabinet
in
his
cage
i
put
those
towels
up
for
privacy
uh
no
worries
i
can
handle
the
oz
full
monty
i
mean
not
'handle'
handle
like
'hands
to
flesh'
handle
mm
okay
well
it's
not
for
you
it's
for
me
'cause
i'm
still
getting
used
to
half
a
monty
oh
good
half
you
and
oz
which
half
wouldn't
you
like
to
know
anyway
he's
more
manageable
tonight
and
on
the
third
night
tomorrow
night
the
total
full
moon
that's
when
he's
a
real
wolfer
but
in
case
there's
trouble
there
won't
be
but
if
sleepy
time
gotcha
thanks
again
for
doing
this
i
wouldn't
have
asked
but
i
have
this
test
no
big
you
can
count
on
me
i
got
my
coffee
magazines
figured
i'd
read
maybe
run
the
stairs
over
there
a
little
bit
i'm
good
bye
nice
place
do
you
ever
catch
kids
doing
the
diddy
out
here
no
there's
a
smooch
spot
up
by
the
woods
that's
usually
where
kids
go
yeah
bet
you
and
scott
have
been
up
there
kicking
the
gearshift
hardly
only
been
on
a
few
dates
but
you
like
him
and
when
you
think
about
him
you
get
that
good
downlow
tickle
right
yeah
i
guess
but
how
low
you
tell
me
how
about
not
but
he
is
and
quite
a
muffin
blueberry
that
crunchy
munchy
stuff
on
top
but
my
most
favorite
thing
so
far
is
that
he
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
kind
of
hell
beast
all
men
are
beasts
buffy
okay
i
was
hoping
to
not
get
that
cynical
till
i
was
at
least
forty
it's
not
cynical
i
mean
it's
realistic
every
guy
from
manimal
down
to
mr
ilovetheenglishpatient
has
beast
in
him
and
i
don't
care
how
sensitive
they
act
they're
all
still
just
in
it
for
the
chase
i
don't
think
that's
true
that
every
guy
is
in
it
only
for
the
chase
i
know
it
is
an
awful
generalization
hey
buffy
that's
what
i
stopped
you
for
basically
hey
okay
hey
how
do
debbie
hi
oz
hey
you're
not
doing
jazz
band
this
year
oh
can't
take
the
pressure
it's
not
the
music
that's
hard
it's
the
marching
we
have
a
marching
jazz
band
yeah
but
you
know
since
the
best
jazz
is
improvisational

be
going

all
directions

just
being
oz
pretty
much
fulltime

panic
just
a
thought
poker
not

game
what's
the
deal
giles
now
uh
bear
in
mind
uh
most
likely
there
there
there
is
no
deal
but
um
if
if
if
there
was
a
deal
then
it
um
would
concern
murder

male
student

student
jeff
orkin

afraid

um
terribly
mauled
now
uh
much
as
i
hate
to
think
it
iiit
could
be
the
handiwork
of
of
me
wolf

not
you
you
but
it's
not
not
wolf
you
not

locked
and
the
window
unbreakable
and
open
oh
god

to
freak
i
rested
my
eyes
now
and
then
that's
all
how
long
exactly
did
you
a
little
now
uh
a
little
then
but
i
never
heard
oz
leave
and
he
was
here
in
the
morning
when
i
um
when
i
woke
up
you
could
put
it
that
way
if
you
want
to
mr
technical
oh
god
two
o'clock
miss
summers
buffy
summers
reporting
for
sanity
look
i
know
that
i
have
to
do
this
and
ii'll
cooperate
and
i'll
look
at
your
ink
blots
and
everything
but
i
don't
wanna
talk
about
my
life
or
my
childhood
or
anything
for
that
matter
actually
and
uh
i
don't
wanna
be
friends
here
we're
not
gonna
be
friends
you
have
friends
already
i
hope
friends
are
a
good
thing
mmhm
they
like
you
agree
with
you
tell
you
what
you
wanna
hear
which
i
offer
have
a
seat
not
too
crazy
those
are
your
credentials
look
buffy
any
person
grownup
shrink
pope
any
person
who
claims
to
be
totally
sane
is
either
lying
or
not
very
bright
i
mean
everyone
has
problems
everybody
has
demons
right
gotta
say
i'm
with
you
on
that
excellent
so
the
hope
i
bring
you
is
demons
can
be
fought
people
can
change
you
can
change
now
your
turn
let's
start
with
why
you
ran
away
that's
a
long
story
mm
bore
me
you
know
i'm
i'm
really
over
it
ii'm
moving
on
i
feel
good
i'm
i'm
even
dating
someone
new
all
good
things
but
still
you're
you're
bringing
me
in
at
the
end
of
the
movie
i
was
dating
someone
uh
itit
ended
badly
my
mom
and
i
were
fighting
and
i
kinda
freaked
well
tell
me
more
about
this
guy
the
bad
ending
guy
he
was
my
first
i
loved
him
and
then
he
changed
yeah
he
got
mean
yes
and
you
didn't
stop
loving
him
look
lots
of
people
lose
themselves
in
love
it's
it's
no
shame
they
write
songs
about
it
the
hitch
is
you
can't
stay
lost
sooner
or
later
you
you
have
to
get
back
to
yourself
and
if
you
can't
if
you
can't
well
love
becomes
your
master
and
you're
just
its
dog
i'm
afraid
to
ask
oz
ate
someone
last
night
he
did
not
oz
does
not
eat
people
it's
more
werewolf
play
you
know
i
bat
you
around
a
little
bit
like
a
cat
toy
i
have
harmless
wolf
fun
no
oz
may
have
got
out
of
his
cage
last
night
or
maybe
there's
a
another
werewolf
roaming
the
woods
perhaps
perhaps
it's
something
else
entirely
it's
okay
we'll
work
together
and
we'll
figure
this
out
yes
um
buffy
uh
you
uh
you
patrol
the
woods
right
we
can
see
if
it's
a
werewolf
kill
or
not
but
what
about
oz
um
well
i
have
some
research
materials
at
home
i
need
to
look
up
uh
wwwe
could
ask
faith
to
watch
over
him
what
you're
having
a
slayer
watch
me
oh
good
we're
not
overreacting
okay
uh
you
know
that
thing
where
you
bail
in
the
middle
of
an
upsetting
conversation
i
have
to
do
that
it's
kinda
dramatic
i
know
but
sometimes
it's
a
necessary
guy
thing
and
i
want
you
to
do
the
guy
thing
but
oz
get
away
from
the
cage
what
it's
gonna
happen
soon
get
away
from
me
oh
god

this
aah

a
okay
scarred
for

pretty
barfworthy

we
be
elsewhere
like
you
know
is
oz
cleared
or
what
huh
i'm
not
sure
i
mean
there
are
a
lot
of
incised
wounds
but
they
could
be
from
anything
anything
with
big
sharp
teeth
and
vicious
do
you
wanna
go
back
to
the
car
and
wait
no
god
i'm
just
saying
almost
done
lemme
just
get
a
few
stray
hairs
from
the
body
great
so
we
got
everything
we
need
yep
that's
it
oh
okay
uh
little
too
much
excitement
for
the
wilster
here
doesn't
look
good
for
oz
does
it
it
really
doesn't
this
guy
was
ripped
apart
by
a
big
wild
animal
oh
oh
uh
buffy
are
you
okay
what
are
you
doing
here
uh
bleeding
internally
but
i'll
live
god
i'm
sorry
i
guess
i
didn't
hear
you
figured
as
much
ow
again
uh
actually
iii
came
to
give
you
the
rest
of
the
night
off
get
out
of
jail
free
huh
how
come
couldn't
sleep
figured
i'd
uh
cram
for
my
french
test
that's
cool
i
was
going
kinda
crazy
in
here
but
i
can
get
in
a
few
stakings
before
sunrise
knock
yourself
out
not
literally
though
yeah
later
hey
hmm
hello
oh
boy
faith
and
her
nutty
books
'exploring
demon
dimensions'
and
'mystery
of
acathla'
yeah
and
she
still
listens
to
heavy
metal
freaky
deaky
buffy
what
if
i
told
you
that
i
had
a
dream
about
angel
and
um
it
brought
up
some
questions
i'd
say
it
was
to
be
expected
must
have
been
some
dream
i
didn't
think
you
knew
what
a
card
index
was
for
i
dreamt
that
he
came
back
of
course
after
jenny
was
killed
i
had
dreams
that
she
was
sstill
alive
that
i
saved
her
this
was
vivid
really
vivid
threedimensional
sensurround
the
hills
are
alive
do
you
believe
it
was
a
prophecy
no
ii
don't
know
i
i
guess
it
just
it
made
me
wonder
is
there
a
chance
even
could
it
happen
well
there's
no
record
of
anyone
returning
from
a
demon
dimension
once
the
gate
was
closed
iii
can't
imagine
how
it
could
happen
oror
why
let's
just
pretend
for
a
second
that
angel
somehow
found
his
way
back
to
sunnydale
what
would
he
be
like
i
really
can't
say
from
what
is
known
about
that
dimension
i
it
would
suggest
a
world
of
brutal
torment
and
time
moves
quite
differently
there
so
i
remember
so
he
would've
been
down
there
for
hundreds
of
years
yes
of
torture
it
would
take
someone
of
extraordinary
will
and
character
to
survive
that
and
uh
retain
any
semblance
of
self
most
likely
he'd
be
be
a
monster
a
lost
cause
maybe
maybe
not
in
my
experience
there
are
two
types
of
monster
the
first
uh
can
be
redeemed
or
more
importantly
wants
to
be
redeemed
and
the
second
type
the
second
is
void
of
humanity
cannot
respond
to
reason
or
love
i
thought
faith
was
on
duty
oh
hey
change
of
plans
glazed
or
cake
it's
fun
to
watch
them
make
them
they
use
this
spritzy
thing
and
they
drop
the
batter
into
this
couldn't
sleep
huh
i've
been
at
mister
donut
since
the
tv
did
that
snowy
thing

now
is
you
debbie
you
and
your
stupid
grating
voice
you're
the
reason
i
started
the
formulas
in
the
first
place
to
be
the
man
you
wanted
and
you
pay
me
back
how
by
whoring
around
with
other
guys
and
taunting
me
no
i
don't
i
don't
even
look
is
that
something
your
shrink
taught
you
debbie
huh
huh
to
share
to
communicate
to
piss
me
off
well
guess
what
even
he's
not
going
to
listen
to
your
pathetic
ramblings
anymore

make
me
mad
huh
you
know
what
happens
debbie
please
are
you
all
right
it's
okay
it's
okay
this
creature
is
especially
brutal
i
believe
the
phrase
coined
by
the
coroner
when
describing
mr
platt
was
'pureed'
but
he
did
confirm
that
platt
was
killed
shortly
before
buffy
found
him
which
means
that
he
was
killed
during
the
day
yes
sorry
i
got
i've
just
been
it's
horrible
horrible
it's
okay
will
we're
all
glad
oz
is
off
the
hook
indeed
shouldn't
he
be
here
by
now
the
sun
sets
at
530
sorry
i'm
late
did
you
bring
the
notes
yeah
um
you

what
oh
yeah
i'm
such
a
klutz
i
um
oh
fell
down
hit
your
eye
doorknob
um
thanks
hey
um
if
you
wanna
talk
thanks
again
for
the
notes
yeah
our
task
now
is
to
determine
what
sort
of
killer
we
are
dealing
with
clearly
we're
looking
for
a
depraved
sadistic
animal
present
hey
i
may
be
a
coldblooded
jelly
doughnut
but
my
timing
is
impeccable
but
you
aren't
ii
it'sit's
a
killintheday
monster
a
hundred
percent
for
sure
okay
uh
i
wish
we
had
time
to
celebrate
properly
however
we
have
two
victims
jeff
orkin
and
uh
now
platt
uh
maybe
there's
something
they
had
in
common
missing
internal
organs
besides
that
debbie
well
victim
number
one
jeff
he
was
in
jazz
band
with
us
they
used
to
horse
around
they
were
screwing
i
don't
think
so
but
he
hid
her
music
comp
book
once
and
we
know
that
debbie
knew
platt
i
mean
she
was
seeing
him
and
way
vocal
about
not
having
love
for
the
guy
add
this
and
stir
i
just
saw
debbie
a
minute
ago
sporting
a
nasty
black
eye
okay
so
pretend
debbie
wanted
platt
dead
maybe
he
fought
back
no
platt
was
dead
in
an
instant
he
didn't
even
drop
his
cigarette
now
what
if
boyfriend
pete's
the
one
doling
out
the
punishment
we
should
find
them
both
immediately
well
debbie
was
in
the
quad
a
minute
ago
all
right
we'll
split
up
um
faith
you
and
i
team
willow
stick
with
buffy
and
i'll
go
lock
myself
in
the
cage
it's
tricky
covering
a
fresh
shiner
like
that
you
know
what
works
what
don't
get
hit
what's
going
on
debbie
i'll
bet
the
farm
you
know
you're
wrong
i
don't
know
anything
normally
i'd
say
you
wanna
play
'i
have
a
secret'
fine
but
people
are
dying
here
it
it's
not
his
fault
i
mean
he's
not
himself
when
he
gets
like
this
you
mean
pete
it's
me
i
make
him
crazy
hehe
just
does
what
he
does
because
he
loves
me
too
much
but
weren't
mr
platt
and
jeff
murdered
by
an
animal
pete's
not
like
other
guys
is
he
debbie
ii've
gotta
go
you
have
to
talk
to
us
we
can't
help
you
until
you
do
i
didn't
ask
for
your
help
well
when
are
you
going
to
i
mean
if
pete
kills
you
it'll
pretty
much
be
too
late
debbie
we're
running
out
of
time
where
can
we
find
him
ii
don't
know
you're
lying
what
if
i
am
what
are
you
gonna
do
about
it
wrong
question
look
at
yourself
why
are
you
protecting
him
anybody
who
really
loved
you
couldn't
do
this
to
you
would
they
take
him
someplace
probably
i
could
never
do
that
to
him
i'm
his
everything
great

you
two
live
out
your
grimm
fairy

of

buffy
buffy
it's
all
over
school
what
happened
with
debbie
and
pete
yeah
a
freshman
told
me
that
pete
had
eight
iced
cafe'
mochas
and
just
lost
it
that's
better
than
the
estrogen
theory
i
heard
he
took
all
of
his
mother's
birth
control
pills
he
didn't
pete
was
a
monster
where
have
i
been
in
your
special
place
cor
which
is
why
i
adore
you
so
what's
the
true
story
what
happened
well
we
got
ahold
of
uh
pete's
lab
books
and
stuff
and
mr
science
was
doing
a
jekyllhyde
deal
he
was
afraid
debbie
was
gonna
leave
him
so
he
mixed
this
potion
to
become
super
mas
macho
the
only
thing
was
after
a
while
he
didn't
need
the
potion
to
turn
into
a
bad
guy
he
did
it
just
fine
on
his
own
so
it
was
like
a
real
killing
he
wasn't
under
the
influence
of
anything
just
himself
uh
i'll
see
you
guys
later
great
now
i'm
gonna
be
stuck
with
serious
thoughts
all
day
i
don't
know
what
to
say
that's
not
gonna
sound
stupid
or
obvious
i've
been
friends
with
them
both
since
before
we
started
school
is
there
anything
i
can
do
thanks
i'm
gonna
be
okay
it's
just
that
you
never
really
know
what's
going
on
inside
somebody
do
you
i
mean
you
think
if
you
care
about
them
but
you
never
really
do
'night
came
on
and
a
full
moon
rose
high
over
the
trees'
cut
to
the
mansion
buffy
watches
as
angel
lies
asleep
on
the
floor
'lighting
the
land
till
it
lay
bathed
in
ghostly
day
and
the
strain
of
the
primitive
remained
alive
and
active'
cut
to
her
the
camera
closes
in
on
her
'faithfulness
and
devotion
things
born
of
fire
and
roof
were
his'
cut
to
angel
he
moves
slightly
and
his
face
contorts
in
anguish
and
pain
as
he
dreams
'yet
he
retained
his
wildness
and
wiliness'
cut
to
buffy
she
is
sitting
on
the
floor
leaning
against
the
wall
watching
him
sleep
and
contemplating
her
life
'and
from
the
depths
of
the
forest
a
call
still
sounded'
