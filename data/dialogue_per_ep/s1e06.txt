offlimits
and
therein
my
friend
lies
the
fun
what
are
kyle
and
his
buds
doing
with

oh
playing

it
with
those

they're
obnoxious
professionally
well
every

'em
so
you
start
a
new
school
you
get
your
desks
some
blackboards

some
mean
kids
yeah
well
i'd
better
extract
lance
before
i'll
handle
it
this
job
doesn't
require
actual
slaying
you
don't
think
we
should
follow
kyle
and
those
guys
are
jerks
but
they're
all
talk
mostly
why
don't
we
yeah
why
don't
we
oh
hold
it
hold
it
are
you
blind

you
just
illiterate

very
quick
to
prey
on
the
weak
oh
wwe
were
just
gonna
take
you're
not
going
in
there
anyone
that
does
is
in
a
world
of

one's
going
in
there
why
is
it
offlimits
it's
a
quarantine
these
hyenas
just
came
in
from
africa
so
keep
out
even
if
they
call
your
name
what
are
you
talking
about
the
masai
tribesmen
told
me
that
hyenas
are
capable
of
understanding
human
speech
they
follow
humans
around
by
day
learning
their
names
at
night
when
the
campfire
dies
they
call
out
to
a
person
once
they
separate
him
the
pack
devours
them
cool
i
don't
see
any
hyenas
okay
now
we've
seen
it
looks
cute
i
think
it
looks
hungry
no
c'mon
spot
c'mon
stop
it
supper
time
guys
stop
it's
not
funny
ow
stop
it
it's
not
funny
why
don't
you
pick
on
somebody
your
own
species
what
are
you
gonna
get
in
my
face
i
thought
xander
would
be
here
by
now
hmm
that'd
make
him
on
time
we
couldn't
have
that
did
he
seem
upset
at
all
on
the
bus
back
from
the
zoo
about
what
i
dunno
he
was
quiet
i
didn't
notice
anything
but
then
again
i'm
not
as
hyperaware
of
him
as
oh
say
for
example
you
hyperaware
well
i'm
not
constantly
monitoring
his
health
his
moods
his
blood
pressure
130
over
80
you
got
it
bad
girl
he
makes
my
head
go
tingly
you
know
what
i
mean
i
dimly
recall
but
it
hasn't
happened
to
you
lately
not
of
late
not
even
for
a
dangerous
and
mysterious
older
man
whose
leather
jacket
you're
wearing
right
now
goes
with
the
shoes
come
on
angel
pushes
your
buttons
you
know
he
does
i
suppose
some
girls
might
find
him
goodlooking
if
they
have
eyes
alright
he's
a
honey
but
it's
just
he's
never
around
and
when
he
is
all
he
wants
to
do
is
talk
about
vampires
and
i
i
just
can't
have
a
relationship
there
he
is
angel
xander

reluctant
man
oh
great
it's
the
winged
monkeys
who's
afraid
to
touch
the
world
why
are
you
hiding
what
is
the
base
of
all
your
fears
do
you
find
yourself
in
a
cold
cruel
world
dark
and
desperate
scared
and
lonely
selfish
man
who
never
gave
to
no
one
else
what
are
you
holding
is
it
worth
the
price
you
pay
y'know
i
don't
understand
why
you're
sitting
at
our
table
'cause
your
eyes
they
see
just
what
you
want
to
see
yeah
shouldn't
you
be
hovering
over
the
football
stadium
with
'goodyear'
written
on
you
and
i
hope
they're
not
staring
blindly
at
me
kid's
fat
right
that's
enough
training
for
one
day
well
that
last
roundhouse
was
kinda
sloppy
are
you
sure
you
don't
wanna
do
it
again
no
no
no
that's
fine
you
just
run
along
to
class
while
i
wait
for
the
feeling
to
return
to
my
arms
look
out
it's
gotten
loose
lordy
herbert
gave
mr
flutie
quite
a
scare
didn't
he
students
i'd
like
you
all
to
met
herbert
our
new
mascot
for
the
sunnydale
high
razorbacks

so
cute
he's
not
cute

a
fierce
razorback

mr
flutie
he's
mean
he's
ready
for
action
see
here
are
the
tusks
the
scary
razorback
you're
right
he's
a
fine
mascot
and
will
engender
school
spirit
uh
he
better
costs
a
fortune
to
feed
him
alright
let's
get
you
back
into
your
cage
this
way
i'm
not
getting
this
it's
simple
really
see
'the
bisector
of
a
vertex
is
the
line
that
divides
the
angle
at
that
vertex
into
two
equal
parts'
xander
it's
like
a
big
blur
all
these
numbers
and
angles
it's
the
same
stuff
from
last
week
you
had
it
down
then
why
do
i
need
to
learn
this
'cause
otherwise
you'll
flunk
math
explain
the
part
where
that's
bad
you
remember
you
fail
math
you
flunk
out
of
school
you
end
up
being
the
guy
at
the
pizza
place
that
sweeps
the
floor
and
says
'hey
kids
where's
the
cool
parties
this
weekend'
we've
been
through
this
do
you
have
a
headache
yeah
and
i
think
i
know
what's
causing
it
ah
that's
better
it
goes
right
to
the
source
of
the
pain
xander
look
forget
it
okay
i
don't
get
it
i
won't
ever
i
don't
care
we
can
finish
this
another
time
see
the
problem
is
you
kids
today
have
no
school
spirit
hold
on
let
me
get
his
outfit
off
today
it's
all
gangs
and
drugs
and
those
movies
on
showtime
with
the
nudity
i
don't
have
cable
i
only
heard
when
i
was
your
age
we
cared
about
the
school's
reputation
and
the
football
team's
record
all
that
stuff
of
course
when
i
was
your
age
i
was
surrounded
by
old
guys
telling
me
how
much
better
things
were
when
they
were
my
age
yeah
alright
it's
raining
all
regular
gym
classes
have
been
postponed
so
you
know
what
that
means
dodgeball
now
for
those
of
you
that
may
have
forgotten
the
rules
are
as
follows
you
dodge
god
this
game
is
brutal
i
love
it
xander
what's
wrong
with
you
i
guess
you've
noticed
that
i've
been
different
around
you
lately

think

think
it's
because
my
feelings
for
you
have
been
changing
and
well
we've
been
friends
for
such
a
long
time
that
i
feel
like
i
need
to
tell
you
something
i've
um
i've
decided
to
drop
geometry
so
i
won't
be
needing
your
math
help
anymore
which
means
i
won't
have
to
look
at
your
pasty
face
again
you
gonna
say
something
to
me
dogs
where
you're
out
of
your
mind
that's
no
way
to
play
guitar

just
hunt
and
peck

sure
its
time

up
though
it's
pouring
down
i'm
sure
this
rain
won't
last
and
it
falls
on
job's
eyes
this
water
of
doubt
and
i'm
wading
in
lies

wearing
me
out
but
if
you
want
it
alright
i'll
buy
it
i'll
buy

i'll
buy
it
i'll
buy
it

i've
known
him
my
whole
life
buffy
well
we
haven't
always
been
close
but
he's
never
i
think
something's
wrong
with
him
or
maybe
there's
something
wrong
with
me
what
are
you
talking
about
c'mon
he's
not
picking
on
you
he's
just
sniffing
you
a
lot
i
don't
know
maybe
three
isn't
company
anymore
you
think
this
has
something
to
do
with
me
of
course
no
that
still
doesn't
explain
why
he's
hanging
out
with
the
dode
patrol
something's
going
on
something
weird
what're
you
gonna
do
talk
to
the
expert
on
weird
xander's
taken
to
teasing
the
less
fortunate
uhhuh
and
there's
been
a
noticeable
change
in
both
clothing
and
demeanor
yes
and
well
otherwise
all
his
spare
time
is
spent
lounging
about
with
imbeciles
it's
bad
isn't
it
it's
devastating
he's
turned
into
a
sixteenyearold
boy
course
you'll
have
to
kill
him
giles
i'm
serious
so
am
i
except
for
the
part
about
killing
him
testosterone
is
a
great
equalizer
it
turns
all
men
into
morons
he
will
however
get
over
it
i
cannot
believe
that
you
of
all
people
are
trying
to
scully
me
there
is
something
supernatural
at
work
here
get
your
books
look
stuff
up
look
under
what
i
don't
know
that's
your
department
the
evidence
that
you've
presented
me
with
is
sketchy
at
best
he
scared
the
pig
well
he
did
buffy
boys
can
be
cruel
they
tease
they
they
they
prey
on
the
weak
iiit's
natural
teen
behavior
pattern
what
did
you
just
say
um
they
tease
they
prey
on
the
weak
i've
heard
that
somewhere
bef
xander
has
been
acting
totally
wiggy
ever
since
we
went
to
the
zoo
him
and
kyle
and
all
those
guys
they
went
into
the
hyena
cage
oh
god
that
laugh
you're
saying
that
uh
xander's
becoming
a
hyena
i
don't
know
or
been
possessed
by
one
not
just
xander
all
of
them
well
iii've
cercertainly
never
heard
of
uh
herbert
they
found
him
the
pig
dead
and
also
eaten
principal
flutie's
freaking
out
testosterone
huh
what're
you
gonna
do
get
my
books
look
stuff
up
you
four
what
oh
don't
think
i
don't
know
three
kids
saw
you
outside
herbert's
room
you're
busted
yeah
you're
goin'
down
how
is
herbert
crunchy
that's
it
my
office
right
now
now
you're
gonna
have
so
much
detention
your
grandchildren'll
be
staying
after
school
wow
apparently
noah
rejected
the
hyenas
from
the
ark
because
he
thought
they
were
an
evil
impure
mixture
of
dogs
and
cats
hyenas
aren't
well
liked
they
do
seem
to
be
the
schmoes
of
the
animal
kingdom
why
couldn't
xander
be
possessed
by
a
puppy
or
or
some
ducks
that's
assuming
'possession'
is
the
right
word
oh
i'll
say
it
is
the
masai
of
the
serengeti
have
spoken
of
animal
possession
for
for
generations
i
i
should
have
remembered
that
so
how
does
it
work
well
apparently
there's
a
a
sect
of
animal
worshipers
known
as
primals
they
believe
that
humanity
uh
consciousness
uh
the
soul
is
a
is
a
perversion
a
dilution
of
spirit
uh
to
them
the
animal
state
is
holy
they
are
able
through
transpossession
to
to
um
draw
the
spirit
of
certain
animals
into
themselves
and
then
they
started
acting
like
hyenas
well
only
the
most
predatory
of
animals
are
are
of
interest
to
the
primals
so
uh
yes
yes
that
would
fit
yes
so
what
happens
to
the
person
once
the
spirit's
in
them
if
it
goes
unchecked
i
gotta
find
xander
they
are
strong
xander
this
is
ridiculous
we
need
to
talk
been
waitin'
for
you
to
jump
my
bones
i
have
seen
some
sick
things
in
my
life
believe
me
but
this
is
beyond
the
pale
what
is
it
with
you
people
is
it
drugs
how
could
you
a
poor
defenseless
pig
what
are
you
doing
get
off
of
me
is
that
what
you
really
want
we
both
know
what
you
really
want
you
want
danger
don't
cha
you
like
your
men
dangerous
you're
in
trouble
xander
you
are
infected
with
some
hyena
thing
it's
like
a
demonic
possession
dangerous
and
mean
right
like
angel
your
mystery
guy
well
guess
who
just
got
mean
now
stop
that
you're
only
gonna
make
things
worse
for
yourselves
i
tell
you
how
this
is
gonna
work
i
am
gonna
call
your
parents
and
they
are
gonna
take
you
all
home
thank
you
i'm
sorry
that
is
it
do
you
know
how
long
i've
waited
until
you'd
stop
pretending
that
we
aren't
attracted
until
willow
stops
kidding
herself
that
i
could
settle
with
anyone
but
you
look
xander
i
don't
wanna
hurt
you
now
do
you
wanna
hurt
me
come
on
slayer
i
like
it
when
you're
scared
the
more
i
scare
you
the
better
you
smell
you're
about
this
close
to
expulsion
people
i'm
willing
to
talk
to
the
school
counselor
and
we
can
discuss
options
get
down
from
there
this
instant
are
you
insane
hurry
up
we
gotta
get
him
locked
up
somehow
before
he
comes
to
oh
my
god
xander
what
happened
i
hit
him
with
what
a
desk
he
tried
his
hand
at
felony
sexual
assault
oh
buffy
the
hyena
in
him
didn't
no
no
but
it's
safe
to
say
that
in
his
animal
state
his
idea
of
wooing
doesn't
involve
a
yanni
cd
and
a
bottle
of
chianti
there
that
oughta
hold
him
where's
giles
he
got
called
to
some
teacher's
meeting
what
are
we
gonna
do
i
mean
how
do
we
get
xander
back
right
now
i'm
a
little
more
worried
about
what
the
rest
of
the
pack
are
up
to
the
rest
of
the
pack
were
spotted
outside
herbert
the
mascot's
cage
they
were
sent
to
the
principal's
office
good
that'll
show
'em
did
it
show
'em
they
didn't
hurt
him
did
they
they
uh
ate
him
they
ate
principal
flutie
ate
him
up
the
uh
official
theory
is
that
wild
dogs
got
into
his
office
somehow
there
was
no
one
at
the
scene
but
xander
didn't
he
he
was
with
you
oh
uh
well
that's
a
small
mercy
giles
how
do
we
stop
this
how
do
you
transpossess
someone
ii'm
afraid
i
still
don't
have
all
the
pieces
um
the
accounts
of
the
primals
and
their
methods
are
a
bit
thin
on
the
ground
there
is
some
talk
of
aaa
predatory
act
but
the
exact
ritual
is
is
um
the
malleus
maleficarum
deals
in
particulars
of
demonic
possession
which
may
apply
oh
that's
great
any
volunteers
oh
good
point
what
we
need
to
do
is
put
the
hyena
back
in
the
hyena
bbut
until
we
know
more
uh
betcha
that
zookeeper
could
tell
us
maybe
he
didn't
quarantine
those
hyenas
because
they
were
sick
we
should
talk
to
him
okay
oh
wait
somebody's
gotta
watch
xander
i
will
will
are
you
sure
if
he
wakes
up
i'll
be
alright
go
c'mon
willow
how
are
you
feeling
like
somebody
hit
me
with
a
desk
what
am
i
doin'
here
you're
resting
you
guys
got
me
locked
up
now
'cause
you're
sick
buffy
said
oh
yeah
buffy
and
her
allpurpose
solution
punch
'em
out
'n'
knock
'em
down
i'd
love
to
see
what
she'd
do
to
somebody
who
was
really
sick
that's
not
fair
buffy
saved
both
of
our
lives
before
she
came
here
our
lives
didn't
need
that
much
saving
did
they
weren't
things
a
lot
simpler
when
it
was
just
you
and
me
maybe
when
we
were
alone
together
willow
i
know
there's
something
wrong
with
me
i
think
it's
gettin'
worse
but
i
can't
just
stand
around
waitin'
for
buffy
to
decide
it's
time
to
punch
me
out
again
look
i
want
you
to
help
me
i
want
you
i
am
helping
you
you're
doing
what
you're
told
buffy's
trying
to
help
you
too
you
know
that
or
xander
does
yeah
buffy's
so
selfless
always
thinking
of
us
well
if
i'm
so
dangerous
how
come
she
left
you
alone
with
me
i
told
her
to
why
'cause
i
know
you
better
than
she
does
and
i
wanted
to
be
here
to
see
if
you
were
still
you
you
know
i
am
look
at
me
looook
xander
now
i
know
let
me
out
let
me
out
the
students
have
been
possessed
by
the
hyenas
yes
are
you
sure
we're
really
really
sure
yyou
don't
seem
enormously
surprised
by
this
the
zoo
imported
those
hyenas
from
africa
there
was
something
strange
about
them
from
day
one
i
did
some
homework
that
particular
breed
is
very
rare
totally
vicious
historically
they
were
worshipped
by
these
guys
primals
yeah
creepy
guys
now
they
had
rituals
for
taking
the
hyena
spirits
but
ii
don't
see
how
that
coulda
happened
to
your
kids
uh
we
don't
know
exactly
how
the
ritual
works
we
know
that
it
involves
a
um
um
predatory
act
and
some
kind
of
symbol
predatory
act
of
course
that
makes
sense
where
did
you
read
that
do
you
have
sherman
jeffries'
work
on
on
cults
and
on
boys
sorry
look
sorry
look
i
think
we
may
have
enough
information
so
that
together
we
could
pull
off
a
reverse
transpossession
what
do
we
do
we've
gotta
get
those
possessed
students
over
to
the
hyena
cage
right
away
i'll
meet
you
there
we
can
begin
the
rituals
wwell
we
can
guarantee
one
of
them
but
there
are
four
more
and
we
have
no
idea
where
they
are
no
i
wouldn't
worry
about
that
after
hyenas
feed
and
rest
they
will
track
the
missing
member
of
their
pack
until
they
find
him
they
should
come
right
to
you
willow
willow
i'm
not
listening
wiiillooow
wiiillooow
xander
shut
up
wiiillooow
run
i
think
they're
going
they
could
be
faking
it
no
they're
hungry
they'll
be
looking
for
somebody
weak
i'm
really
sorry
will
i
didn't
know
they
were
gonna
come
after
xander
it's
okay
we
must
lead
them
back
to
the
zoo
if
we're
going
to
stop
this
and
before
their
next
meal
guess
that's
my
job
well
individually
they're
almost
as
strong
as
you
as
a
group
they're
they're
tough
but
i
think
they're
getting
stupider
you
guys
go
to
the
zoo
and
i
will
bring
them
to
you
i
didn't
say
she
looks
better
than
you
i
said
she
looks
better
i
heard
what
i
heard
joey
chew
you
have
to
chew
or
you'll
choke
i
don't
see
why
we
have
to
have
this
conversation
every
time
we
see
them
i
didn't
start
it
damn
where
are
the
keys
huh

going
on

the
transpossession
almost
oh

the
uh
sacred

to
um

would
be
here
when

terribly
frustrating
for
you
that
a
bunch
of
school
children
could
accomplish
what
you
could
not
it
bothered
me

the
power
will
be
mine
