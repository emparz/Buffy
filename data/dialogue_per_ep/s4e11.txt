i
guess
we
have
to
talk
i
guess
we
do
somebody
should
speak
before
one
of
us
graduates
what
are
you
capricorn
on
the
cusp
of
aquarius
you
sorry
that
came
out
a
little
blunter
than
i
intended
it's
just
you
are
amazing
your
speed
your
strength
also
passionate
artistic
and
inquisitive
who
are
you
you
know
who
i
am
the
rest
what
i
do
i
can't
tell
you
well
then
let
me
you're
part
of
some
military
monster
squad
that
captures
demons
vampires
probably
have
some
official
sounding
euphemisms
for
them
like
unfriendlies
or
–
nonsapiens
hostile
sub
terrestrials
so
you
deliver
these
–
hsts
to
a
bunch
of
lab
coats
who
perform
experiments
on
them
which
among
other
things
turn
some
into
harmless
little
bunnies
how
am
i
doing
so
far
a
little
too
well
meanwhile
by
day
you
pretend
to
be
riley
finn
cornfed
iowa
boy
ever
been
to
iowa
riley
god
if
that's
even
your
name
it
is
born
and
raised
and
hey
bulletin
i'm
not
the
only
one
who's
been
a
little
less
than
honest
here
i
thought
a
professional
demon
chaser
like
yourself
would
have
figured
it
out
by
now
i'm
the
slayer
slayer
chosen
one
she
who
hangs
out
a
lot
in
cemeteries
you're
kidding
ask
around
look
it
up
slayer
comma
the
and
you
fight
demons
i
mean
you
waled
on
those
guys
you
did
pretty
well
yourself
but
i'm
a
walking
bruise
today
you
see
me
with
my
clothes
off
i
look
like
i
mean
i
have
–
bruises
i
don't
see
a
scratch
on
you
you're
not
looking
hard
enough
i'm
looking
pretty
hard
so
then
what
do
we
do
i
don't
know
i
just
i
really
thought
that
you
were
a
nice
normal
guy
i
am
a
nice
normal
guy
maybe
by
this
town's
standards
but
i'm
not
grading
on
a
curve
i
think
we
both
need
a
little
time
to
–
process
everything
maybe
then
yeah
yeah
i
think
that's
a
good
idea
oh
i
don't
think
i
need
to
tell
you
i
won't
say
a
word
good
it'll
be
safer
for
all
over
here
wow
that
was
some
ride
sorry
i'm
so
excited
this
is
my
first
earthquake
it's
not
mine
sodden
sleeping
chair
is
bloody
–
sodden
the
quake
just
knocked
a
couple
of
pipes
lose
there
is
a
wrench
hanging
up
over
there
by
the
workbench
try
tightening
the
coupling
do
i
look
like
a
plumber
to
you
no
you
look
like
a
big
mooch
that
doesn't
lift
a
finger
around
here
but
i
have
to
get
to
work
yeah
delivering
melted
cheese
on
bread
doing
your
part
to
keep
america
constipated
mock
not
remember
who
pays
for
the
plasma
around
here
pal
you
earn
your
keep
or
you
don't
get
kept
when
you're
done
fixing
that
leak
try
cleaning
up
this
mess
and
doing
a
little
laundry
for
once
wouldn't
kill
you
unfortunately
hey
i
was
in
the
library
during
the
quake
almost
got
buried
under
some
19th
century
literature
and
i
don't
have
to
tell
you
how
hard
it
is
to
dig
through
some
of
that
stuff
you
okay
yeah
a
couple
of
broken
knickknacks
but
no
biggies
well
porter
dorm
is
completely
blacked
out
so
naturally
they
are
dealing
with
the
crisis
the
only
way
they
know
how
'aftershock
party'
ah
this
from
the
dorm
that
brought
us
the
‘somebody
sneezed'
party
and
the
‘day
that
ends
in
y'
party
they
do
seem
to
be
pretty
generous
with
the
milestones
hey
you
should
ask
riley
to
come
much
carousing
by
flattering
candlelight
ah
riley
is
–
ahm
busy
i'm
pretty
sure
but
you
know
you
go
on
ahead
and
i'll
catch
up
with
you
there
i'm
on
my
way
for
a
little
giles
oneonone
anything
wrong
wrong
no
mmmm
not
at
all
something
horrible
is
going
to
happen
giles
it
was
an
earthquake
buffy
a
not
uncommon
occurrence
in
southern
california
no
reason
to
think
it
was
anything
more
oh
i
so
have
a
reason
a
darn
good
reason
the
last
time
we
had
an
earthquake
i
died
yes
i
know
that
and
therefore
i
completely
understand
your
anxiety
oh
good
because
i'd
hate
for
my
little
untimely
horrible
death
concern
to
be
ambiguous
but
unless
evidence
suggests
otherwise
i
think
that
we
can
assume
that
it's
shifting
landmasses
and
not
a
portent
of
some
imminent
doom
now
in
the
meantime
i've
got
a
few
theories
about
our
mysterious
commando
friends
oh
really
now
based
on
the
locations
of
our
various
sightings
and
spike's
reluctant
description
of
their
underground
installation
what
if
the
quake
was
a
sign
ah
a
bad
omen
and
we
just
ignore
it
there
is
going
to
be
a
lot
of
red
faces
when
the
world
comes
to
an
end
buffy
if
the
quake
heralds
some
such
catastrophe
i'm
sure
there
will
be
other
signs
to
follow
which
will
afford
us
plenty
of
time
to
avert
it
now
i
believe
that
the
commando
installation
is
either
very
close
to
or
directly
underneath
your
school
now
if
that
is
the
case
i'm
convinced
that
one
or
more
of
them
may
be
in
your
very
midst
plague
what
what
if
the
end
of
the
world
is
coming
in
the
form
of
a
plague
then
too
many
people
may
be
infected
by
the
time
we
actually
buffy
will
you
stop
worrying
about
what
may
be
and
concentrate
on
what
is
vigilance
is
all
very
good
but
as
we
are
getting
close
the
is
a
much
more
pressing
question
what's
a
slayer
slayer
thrash
band
anvil
handed
guitar
band
with
delusions
of
black
sabbath
no
a
girl
with
powers
oh
the
slayer
oh
yeah
i've
heard
of
the
slayer
fill
me
in
well
the
way
i
got
it
figured
the
slayer
is
like
some
kind
of
boogeyman
for
the
subterrestrials
something
they
tell
their
little
spawn
to
make
them
eat
their
vegetables
and
clean
up
their
slime
pits
you're
telling
me
she
doesn't
exist
oh
wait
a
sec
am
i
bursting
somebody's
bubble
here
maybe
this
is
a
bad
time
to
tell
you
about
–
the
easterbunny
sorry
sorry
it's
a
myth
rye
all
part
of
that
medieval
folklore

day

sure
where
the
party

and
then
i
saw
the
flashing
lights
and
the
ambulance
and
i
was
like
right
of
course
death
carnage
–
it's
a
buffy
party
i'm
so
glad
you're
here
what
happened
i
found
him
–
this
guy
on
the
bed
with
me
dead
not
me
dead
he
dead
god
are
you
okay
vampire
there

so
much
blood
and
there
–
there
was
a
symbol
and
percy
said
i
was
a
nerd
percy
called
you
a
nerd
i
guess
we
should
report
to
giles
get
with
the
demon
tracking
does
he
even
go
here
okay
that
makes
0
for
a
billion
you
don't
got
game
son
what's
going
on
in
that
head
of
yours
i'm
just
trying
to
–
make
up
my
mind
about
something
buffy
she's
pretty
cool
isn't
she
yes
already
she's
cool
she's
hot
she
is
tepid
she's
all
temperature
buffy
now
can
we
concentrate
on
the
game
here
good
block
you
should
use
your
face
more
often
we
have
an
alpha
code
blue
situation
one
of
ours
negative
civilian
at
the
porter
hall
party
hst
attack
can
not
confirm
that
i
couldn't
get
close
without
drawing
attention
to
myself
should
we
mobilize
no
i'll
go
do
a
little
recon
see
if
it
falls
in
our
domain
you
alert
prof
walsh
tell
her
we
have
a
casualty
of
an
indeterminate
nature
let's
not
make
a
move
until
we
get
the
whole
story
it
just
made
me
feel
like
i
was
right
back
in
high
school
dumb
jock
if
it
wasn't
for
you
he
still
would
be
i
mean
i
know
the
percy
thing
isn't
really
important
it's
the
dead
guy
on
the
bed
yeah
that's
bad
too
ooh
and
something
else
he
the
dead
guy
waswas
propped
up
like
whatever
killed
him
wanted
to
drain
the
blood
out
of
him
so
i'm
thinking
the
whatever
took
a
bunch
of
the
guy's
blood
with
it
and
i
haven't
been
a
nerd
for
a
very
long
time
hello
dating
a
guitarist
or
i
was
tell
me
about
this
symbol
right
it
was
carved
into
his
chest
like
a
big
creepy
eye
it's
kind
of
the
cbs
logo
hey
could
this
be
the
handiwork
of
one
mr
morley
safer
i'm
telling
you
i've
seen
this
somewhere
before
i
just
can't
remember
where
i
mean
it's
like
it's
the
end
of
the
world
again
it's
ah
the
earthquake
that
symbol
yes
i
told
you
ii
said
end
of
the
world
and
you're
like
poopoo
southern
california
poopoo
i'm
so
very
sorry
my
contrition
completely
dwarfs
the
impending
apocalypse
no
iit
can't
be
we've
done
this
already
it's
the
end
of
the
world
everyone
dies
it's
rather
important
really
so
what
do
we
do
i
stop
it
i
wonder
where
i've
seen
this
before
where
else
the
place
i
spend
most
of
my
waking
hours
memorizing
stuff
of
the
sides
of
mausoleums
big
freaky
cereal
boxes
of
death
door
was
open
wow
that
flippything
you
did
where
did
it
go
i
saw
it
take
off
towards
the
woods
and
you
didn't
follow
it
no
weapons
no
backup
you
don't
go
after
a
demon
that
size
by
yourself
i
do
yeah
well
i'm
no
slayer
base
one
this
is
lilac
one
lilac
confirmed
sighting
of
an
unidentified
subt
mobilize
patrol
team
for
debriefing
at
o800
hours
copy
that
very
commandory
–
lilac
not
withstanding
what
are
you
doing
here
looking
for
you
she
who
hangs
out
in
cemeteries
i
have
to
–
get
the
demon
don't
sweat
it
we'll
bag
it
it's
not
that
simple
yeah
but
i
really
think
riley
i
just
can't
can't
talk
can't
any
of
it
i
can't
be
with
you
it's
just
a
huge
black
pit
of
a
mistake
and
i
can't
go
there
again
again
you've
dated
me
before
no
look
i
was
involved
you
don't
know
what
my
life
is
like
but
i'm
dying
to
find
out
dying
being
the
operative
word
here
okay
there
is
too
much
risk
there
is
too
much
it's
just
doomed
and
i
can't
do
doomed
again
right
now
sorry
ii
don't
understand
where
this
is
coming
from
i
know
you
like
me
and
it's
not
like
we
don't
have
anything
in
common
but
that's
not
enough
buffy
i'm
thrown
by
this
i'm
confused
but
i
can
feel
my
skin
humming
my
hands
my
every
inch
of
me
i've
never
been
this
excited
about
anybody
before
i'm
not
trying
to
scare
you
and
i'm
not
going
to
force
myself
on
you
but
i'm
by
god
not
going
to
walk
away
because
i
think
it
might
not
work
i
don't
know
what's
happened
in
your
past
pain
death
apocalypse
none
of
it
fun
–
do
you
know
what
a
hellmouth
is
do
you
have
a
fancy
term
for
it
because
i
went
to
high
school
on
it
for
three
years
we
do
not
have
that
much
in
common
this
is
a
job
to
you
it's
not
just
a
job
it's
an
adventure
great
but
for
me
it's
destiny
it
is
something
that
i
can't
change
something
that
i
can't
escape
i'm
stuck
you
don't
have
to
be
you're
not
in
high
school
anymore
you
can
change
things
riley
no
i
know
it
may
seem
riley
my
answer
is
no
a
vahrall
demon
eew
i
second
that
revulsion
yes
‘slick
like
gold
and
gird
in
moonlight
father
of
portents
and
brother
to
blight'
limbs
with
talons
eyes
like
knives
bane
to
the
blameless
thief
of
lives
three
meters
tall
approximately
100
–120
kilograms
based
on
my
visual
analysis
special
hazards
unknown
probably
nothing
we
haven't
handled
before
there
is
no
pattern
we
can
discern
yet
so
we
got
to
assume
that
it
is
on
a
basic
killcrushdestroy
this
thing
isn't
digging
up
the
bones
of
a
child
for
fun
well
a
demon's
got
some
pretty
hilarious
ideas
about
fun
bones
of
a
child
though
i
saw
that
an
ancient
ritual
–
uses
the
blood
of
a
man
the
bones
of
a
child
and
–
something
called
the
word
of
valios
iit's
all
part
of
the
sacrifice
–
the
sacrifice
of
three
let
me
guess
–
ends
the
world
well
yeah
iit's
not
big
with
the
details
though
it
doesn't
say
how
the
world
ends
or
what
the
ritual
entails
exactly
the
sacrifice
of
three
–
three
people
are
going
to
die
no
they
won't
because
claw
boy
is
not
getting
all
of
his
ingredients
we
have
to
find
that
third
one
the
word
of
valios
keep
him
from
getting
it
if
he
doesn't
already
have
it
i
mean
who
knows
where
he's
been
here
is
one
for
the
good
guys
this
thing
has
a
pheromone
signature
a
mile
wide
agent
gates
has
been
working
with
the
detection
system
the
lab's
developing
can't
tell
where
it's
going
but
i've
got
a
bead
on
where
it's
been
residual
traces
showing
up
in
populated
areas
the

kill

quadrant

blanket

book

word

valios

about
the
book
archives
at
the
museum
we'll
stop
at
my
place
on
the
way
get
some
weapons
and
i'll
change
into
something
that
isn't
quite
as
anchovy
scented
you
guys
this
thing
takes
wicked
very
seriously
be
careful
i
couldn't
stand
anybody
getting
hurt
goodbye
dru
see
you
in
hell
what
are
you
doing
bloody
rot
can't
a
person
knock
what
were
you
doing
you
were
trying
to
stake
yourself
fag
off
it's
no
concern
of
yours
is
too
for
one
thing
that's
my
shirt
you're
about
to
dust
for
another
we've
shared
a
lot
here
you
should
have
trusted
me
enough
to
do
it
for
you
xander
what
he
wants
to
die
i
want
to
help
it's
okay
we
know
him
we
can't
just
let
him
poof
himself
oh
but
you
can
you
know
i'd
drain
you
drier
than
the
sahara
if
i
had
half
a
chance
and
besides
i'm
beyond
pathetic
stuck
in
this
basement
washing
skivvies
for
a
blighter
i
wouldn't
have
bothered
to
bite
a
few
months
ago
hey
i
mean
am
i
even
remotely
scary
anymore
tell
me
the
truth
well
the
shirt
is
kinda
–
not
very
threatening
–
and
the
short
pants
but
you
know
it
could
also
be
because
i
know
you
can't
bite
which
i
guess
isn't
really
what
you
need
to
hear
right
now
is
it
stop
please
just
clear
out
fine
but
you
break
anything
else
while
we're
gone
and
you'll
be
sleeping
in
the
garage
buster
we
can't
leave
him
here
like
this
we'll
have
to
take
him
with
us
to
the
museum
oh
you
go
on
i
won't
do
anything
i
feel
better
now
promise
think
of
the
happy
if
we
don't
find
what
we're
looking
for
we
face
an
apocalypse
really
you're
not
just
saying
that
buffy
is
this
really
the
time
for
donkey
kong
what
oh
it
ah
takes
trace
readings
of
creatures
pheromones
and
and
it's
either
mating
season
for
this
thing
or
it's
moving
all
over
town
you
know
buffy
actually
i
need
to
go
big
bad
needs
to
be
squished
right
i'm
on
it
too
it's
just
this
thing
this
you
and
me
thing
it's
stupid
i
know
which
is
why
we
can't
do
it
the
you
and
me
thing
no
i
mean
you're
stupid
i
mean
–
i
don't
mean
that
–
no
i
think
maybe
i
do
wow
with
sweet
talk
like
that
you'll
definitely
melt
my
reservations
i'm
serious
you
have
this
twisted
way
of
looking
at
things
this
doom
and
gloom
mentality
you
keep
thinking
like
that
and
things
will
probably
turn
out
just
the
way
you
expect
you
know
there
is
nothing
more
dangerous
than
a
psychgradstudent
buffy
where
is
the
bad
here
it
just
turns
out
–
we
are
even
more
wellmatched
than
we
thought
we
were
i
mean
you're
a
–
fry
cook
–
and
so
am
i
yeah
but
you're
an
amateur
–
fry
cook
and
i
come
form
a
long
line
of
fry
cooks
that
don't
live
past
25
which
is
exactly
the
attitude
i'm
talking
about
look
i
know
the
risks
of
what
we
do
i
also
know
it's
more
rewarding
than
any
other
job
on
the
planet
–
and
fun
fun
the
last
person
i
know
that
believed
that
is
in
a
coma
right
now
because
she
had
so
much
fun
on
the
job
i'm
not
saying
that
you
shouldn't
take
your
work
seriously
that
i
should
just
turn
my
frown
upside
down
is
that
it
i
wish
i
could
but
this
isn't
the
kind
of
gig
where
you
can
just
hang
it
up
at
the
end
of
the
night
and
snuggle
with
your
honey
but
why
why
can't
it
be
because
i've
tried
it
okay
and
every
time
it
just
fell
apart
and
then
i
get
sucked
right
back
in
to
the
uberevil
welcome
to
the
story
of
the
world
things
fall
apart
buffy
and
evil
–
it
comes
and
goes
but
the
way
people
manage
is
they
don't
do
it
alone
they
pull
each
other
through
if
you
weren't
so
selfinvolved
you'd
see
that
you
have
no
idea
what
you're
talking
about
you
barely
know
me
i
know
that
it's
not
just
a
job
thing
i'm
sure
that
there
is
some
goodlooking
guy
that
done
you
wrong
in
there
too
but
mostly
i
think
you
want
to
stay
down
in
that
dark
place
because
maybe
it's
safer
down
there
you
are
so
out
of
line
no
see
i
don't
think
so
look
we
have
an
opportunity
here
you
and
me
and
the
fact
that
you're
too
scared
to
even
give
it
a
try
is
my
business
so
why
don't
you
just
leave
me
alone
fair
enough
great
no
word
of
valios
not
even
a
syllable
of
valios
which
means
i'm
one
step
closer
to
melting
in
a
sea
of
molten
hellfire
yeah
you
shouldn't
talk
like
that
yeah
okay
so
you
can't
kill
anymore
but
there
are
other
fun
things
you
can
do
you'll
adjust
adjust
and
what
end
up
like
the
two
of
you
no
thank
you
here
it
goes
‘we
can't
jus
leave
him
here
to
stake
himself
it's
not
right'
i
should
think
you
would
be
glad
to
greet
the
end
of
days
i
mean
neither
one
of
you
is
making
much
of
a
go
at
it
you
kids
your
age
are
going
off
to
university
you've
made
it
as
far
as
the
basement
and
red
here
you
couldn't
even
keep
dogboy
happy
you
can
take
the
loser
out
of
high
school
but
i
see
what
you're
doing
you're
trying
to
get
us
to
dust
you
am
not
i
just
don't
want
pity
from
geeks
more
useless
than
i
am
we're
not
useless
we
–
we
help
people
we
fight
the
forces
of
evil
buffy
fights
the
forces
of
evil
you're
her
groupies
she'd
do
just
as
well
without
you
–
better
i'd
wager
since
she
wouldn't
have
to
go
about
saving
your
hides
all
the
time
that
is
no
not
true
we're
part
of
the
team
she
needs
us
or
you're
just
the
same
tenth
grade
losers
you've
always
been
and
she's
too
much
of
a
softy
to
cut
you
lose
oh
–
as
usual
–
dear
what
happened
it's
my
fault
i
should
have
known
giles
the
word
of
valios
–
is
the
name
of
a
talisman
–
not
a
book
i
blame
myself
entirely
i
had
it
here
you
had
it
here
okay
first
i
thought
you
were
being
too
hard
on
yourself
but
oh
thank
you
i
bought
it
at
a
sorcerer's
estate
sale
i
really
only
glanced
at
it
once
i
thought
it
was
a
knock
off
well
they
have
it
and
they
probably
have
their
sacrifices
by
now
too
they're
on
their
way
to
perform
the
sacrifice
now
on
their
way
where
you
found
out
what
the
ritual
is
for
the
hellmouth
they
are
going
to
open
the
hellmouth
the
one
in
the
library
looks
like
we're
going
back
to
high
school
be
careful
you
guys
the
place
doesn't
look
to
stable
fine
by
me
hope
we
all
go
under
why
is
he
even
here
it's
not
like
he
can
fight
if
we
leave
him
alone
he'll
stake
himself
and
that's
bad
because
fine
whatever
just
keep
him
out
of
the
way
i
do
not
have
time
for
this
okay
when
we
get
to
the
library
keep
a
look
out
for
victims
they're
keeping
alive
for
the
sacrifice
getting
them
out
is
the
first
priority
will
do
okay
–
you
guys
ready
lets
rock
and
roll
lets
rock
and
roll
sunnydale
high
these
walls
–
if
they
were
still
walls

could
tell

crispy

near
the
library

new
floor

ritual
is
not
finished
and
it's
not
gonna
be
the
blood
get
the
talisman
they
can't
do
the
ritual

got
the
bones

got
the
wrong
man

had
a
lot
