if
i
could
walk
out
oz
looks
out
into
the
crowd
a
smile
for
willow
on
his
face
she
is
sitting
at
a
table
with
xander
and
cordelia
they
have
to
share
it
with
some
other
people
it's
so
crowded
you
know
i'd
never
lie
the
song
ends
with
oz's
last
chord
understated
and
fading
the
crowd
begins
to
applaud
and
cheer
as
devon
takes
his
bows
oz
lifts
his
guitar
from
his
shoulder
leans
the
instrument
against
the
back
wall
of
the
stage
and
heads
down
the
stairs
at
the
side
of
the
stage
to
join
the
gang
at
their
table
oz
hey
have
a
seat
except
we
don't
have
any
seats
it's
okay
i'll
just
scrunch
in
xander
why
are
you
giving
me
a
lap
dance
what
i
just
like
you
and
that's
very
beautiful
i
think
it's
great
when
two
people
like
two
people
and
want
to
be
close
to
them
instead
of
anyone
else
here
here
yeah
well
put
hey
can
i
snag
a
sip
sure
yeah
you
got
it
thank
you
thank
you
uh
we're
here
through
saturday
enjoy
the
veal
why
are
you
guys
so
hyper
hey
speaking
of
people
and
things
they
do
that
aren't
like
usual
anyone
notice
buffy
acting
sort
of
different
let's
see
uh
killing
zombies
uh
torching
sewer
monsters
and
no
that's
pretty
much
the
uh
same
old
buffster
well
i
just
mean
you
know
she's
off
by
herself
a
lot
more
and
she's
kind
of
distracted
think
maybe
she
has
a
new
honey
a
boyfriend
why
wouldn't
she
tell
us
excuse
me
when
your
last
steady
killed
half
the
class
and
then
your
rebound
guy
sends
you
a
dumpogram
it
makes
a
girl
shy
but
we're
the
best
of
buffy's
bestest
buds
she'd
tell
us
tell
you
what
about
your
new
boyfriend
who
we
made
up
unless
we
didn't
this
was
a
topic
of
discussion
well
raised
but
never
discussed
so
are
you
dating
somebody
or
not
i
wouldn't
use
the
word
'dating'
but
i
am
going
out
with
somebody
tonight
as
a
matter
of
fact
really
who
yo
what's
up
hey
time
to
motorvate
really
we're
just
good
friends
synchronized
slaying
new
olympic
category
whadaya
think
sloppy
you
telegraph
punches
leave
blind
sides
open
and
uh
for
a
schoolnight
slaying
take
entirely
too
much
time
which
one
of
you
is
faith
depends
who
the
hell
are
you
gwendolyn
post
mrs
your
new
watcher
i'm
telling
you
i
don't
need
a
new
watcher
no
offense
lady
i
just
have
this
problem
with
authority
figures
they
end
up
kind
of
dead
duly
noted
and
fortunately
it's
not
up
to
you
mr
giles
where
do
you
keep
the
rest
of
your
books
ii'm
sorry
the
rest
yes
the
actual
library
oh
i
see
i
can
assure
you
mrs
post
this
is
the
finest
occult
reference
collection
this
side
of
the
atlantic
i'm
sure
do
you
have
hume's
paranormal
encyclopedia
the
labyrinth
maps
of
malta
it's
on
order
well
i
suppose
that
you
have
sir
robert
kane's
twilight
compendium
oh
uh
yes
i
yes
yes
i
do
of
course
you
do
i
have
been
sent
by
the
council
for
a
very
important
reason
faith
needs
a
watcher
i
am
to
act
in
that
capacity
and
report
back
excuse
me
mary
poppins
you
don't
seem
to
be
listening
faith
if
the
council
feels
that
you
need
closer
observation
then
we
will
all
of
course
cooperate
the
council
wishes
me
to
report
on
the
entire
situation
here
including
you
mm
academic
probation's
not
so
funny
today
huh
giles
the
fact
is
there
is
talk
in
the
council
that
you
have
become
a
bit
too
american
me
him
a
demon
named
lagos
is
coming
here
to
the
hellmouth
mr
giles
an
illustration
of
lagos
if
you
please
oh
uh
perhaps
later
lagos
seeks
the
glove
of
myhnegon
no
record
of
this
glove's
full
power
exists
but
we
do
know
it
is
highly
dangerous
and
must
not
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
demon
lagos
must
be
stopped
what
do
you
propose
well
if
it's
not
too
radical
a
suggestion
i
thought
we
might
kill
him
i
suggest
two
slayers
at
full
strength
for
a
coordinated
hunt
we
believe
the
glove
to
be
buried
in
a
tomb
somewhere
so
lagos
will
be
headed
for
the
cemetery
there
is
more
than
one
in
sunnydale
i
see
how
many
uh
twelve
within
the
city
limits
well
we'll
just
have
to
take
them
one
at
a
time
anything
in
your
books
that
might
pinpoint
the
exact
location
of
the
tomb
would
be
useful
but
then
we
cannot
ask
for
miracles
we
will
begin
tomorrow
at
sunset
faith
with
me
please
that
was
bracing
interesting
lady
can
we
kill
her
i
think
the
council
might
frown
upon
that
well
how
do
you
feel
about
a
spot
of
training
uhh
i
gotta
go
big
night
for
us
slayer
types
people
to
see
demons
to
kill
better
hurry
before
somebody
figures
out
what
we're
doing
what
are
we
doing
training
and
almost
kissing
sorry
it's
just
old
habit
it's
hard
it's
not
hard
cold
turkey
that's
the
key
to
quitting
you
think
they
make
a
patch
for
this
you
have
to
go
i
really
do
i'm
gonna
try
and
vent
a
little
hormonal
angst
by
going
out
there
and
killing
a
lagos
whatever
that
is
lagos
some
demon
looking
for
some
allpowerful
thingamabob
and
i
gotta
stop
him
before
he
unleashes
unholy
havoc
and
it's
another
tuesday
night
in
sunnydale
be
careful
oh
this
is
intolerable
there's
not
a
word
here
about
lagos
or
the
glove
we
don't
have
time
for
this
nearmissing
just
find
out
all
you
can
about
the
demon
itsitsits
strengths
itsits
weaknesses
its
places
of
origin
and
most
importantly
what
it
plans
to
do
with
this
blasted
glove
hey
you're
not
the
watcher
of
me
then
go
home
but
if
you
choose
to
stay
then
work
ugh
it's
late
i'm
tired
what
does
he
want
from
us
anyway
the
number
of
a
qualified
surgeon
to
remove
the
british
flag
from
his
butt
my
eyes
are
all
blurry
ohh
oh
stop
right
stop
means
no
and
no
means
no
so
um
stop
willow
xander
you
can
stop
your
uh
studying
i've
got
what
i
need
what
have
you
got
uh
the
probable
location
of
the
glove
of
myhnegon
yeah
that's
that
big
one
over
at
the
restfield
cemetery
yeah
well
that's
great
giles
um
how'd
you
find
it
i
looked
where's
buffy
at
uh
i'm
not
sure
well
i'll
go
check
out
this
uh
crypt
um
tell
her
headsup
if
she
uh
stops
by
yes
by
all
means
go
aand
i'll
just
keep
studying
i
think
we're
on
the
verge
of
a
big
lagos
breakthrough
no
i'd
say
we're
done
ronnie
deadbeat
steve
klepto
kenny
drummer
eventually
i
just
had
to
face
up
to
my
destiny
as
a
loser
magnet
now
it's
strictly
get
some
get
gone
you
can't
trust
guys
you
can
trust
some
guys
yeah
so
what
about
you
you
mean
like
me
and
guys
me
mmhm
not
much
to
tell
these
days
yeah
but
you
gotta
have
stories
i
mean
i've
had
my
share
of
losers
but
you
you
boinked
the
undead
what
was
that
like
life
with
angel's
was
complicated
it's
still
a
little
hard
for
me
to
talk
about
well
try
look
faith
all
the
angel
issues
are
still
kind
of
with
me
so
if
you
don't
mind
i'd
rather
not
yeah
yeah
whatever
you
know
what
we're
oh
for
six
tonight
why
don't
we
just
blow
this
off
yeah
i
am
kinda
beat
butbut
shady
hill's
pretty
close
i'll
swing
through
it
it's
on
my
way
anyway
alone
ii
don't
know
if
i'd
i
got
miss
priss
on
my
back
now
i
don't
need
another
baby
sitter
i'll
holler
if
i'm
having
any
fun
okay
later
thanks
son
of
a
bitch
it's
my
lucky
day
hey
giles
here's
a
nifty
idea
why
don't
i
alleviate
my
guilt
by
goin'
out
and
gettin'
myself
really
really
killed
oh
god
buffy
what
am
i
doing
what
are
you
doing
i
don't
know
shame
on
you
oh
god
i
i
don't
even
know
why
i
came
back
here
it's
good
you
did
i
think
i
have
what
you're
looking
for
great
just
wherever
this
was
giftwrapped
remind
me
not
to
shop
there
glove
of
myhnegon
the
world's
ugliest
fashion
accessory
no
don't
once
you
put
it
on
the
glove
can
never
be
removed
so
no
touching
kinda
like
us
you
hold
on
to
it
i'll
i'll
tell
giles
in
the
morning
at
least
he'll
be
happy
ah
yes
there
we
are
there's
a
wood
engraving
see
the
glove
of
myhnegon
yes
engraved
by
father
theodore
of
wolsham
yes
based
i
believe
on
very
sketchy
and
unreliable
folk
legends
the
pictures
are
fun
to
look
at
mr
giles
but
one
really
ought
to
read
the
nice
words
as
well
ah
yes
some
tea
perhaps
i
know
that
you
must
find
me
tiresome
but
it's
insidious
really
a
person
slips
up
on
the
little
things
and
soon
everything
has
gone
to
hell
in
a
handbasket
for
example
buffy
your
slayer
mrs
post
i
can
assure
you
that
buffy
is
both
dedicated
and
industrious
and
i
am
in
complete
control
of
my
slayer
giles
we
have
a
big
problem
it's
buffy
will
you
excuse
us
would
you
like
some
assistance
thank
you
that
won't
be
necessary
lagos
is
out
of
luck
i
got
the
magic
mitten
thingy
what's
with
all
the
tragedy
masks
better
take
a
seat
buffy
what's
going
on
we
know
angel
is
alive
xander
saw
you
with
him
it
would
appear
that
you've
been
hiding
him
and
that
you
lied
to
us
nobody's
here
to
blame
you
buffy
but
this
is
serious
you
need
help
it's
not
what
you
think
hope
not
because
i
think
you're
harboring
a
vicious
killer
this
isn't
about
attacking
buffy
remember
'i'
statements
only
'i
feel
angry'
'i
feel
worried'
cordelia
fine
here's
one
i
feel
worried
about
me
last
time
around
angel
barely
laid
a
hand
on
buffy
he
was
way
more
interested
in
killing
her
friends
but
he's
better
now
better
for
how
long
buffy
i
mean
did
you
even
think
about
that
what
is
this
demons
anonymous
i
don't
need
an
intervention
here
oh
don't
you
you
must've
known
it
was
wrong
seeing
angel
or
you
wouldn't
have
hidden
it
from
all
of
us
i
was
going
to
tell
you
i
was
iit
was
just
that
i
i
didn't
know
why
he
came
back
i
just
wanted
to
wait
for
what
for
angel
to
go
psycho
again
the
next
time
you
give
him
a
happy
i'm
not
going
to
we're
not
together
like
that
but
you
were
kissing
him
you
were
spying
on
me
what
gives
you
the
right
what
gives
you
the
right
to
suck
face
with
your
demon
lover
again
it
was
an
accident
what
you
just
tripped
and
fell
on
his
lips
it
was
wrong
okay
i
know
that
and
i
know
that
it
can't
happen
again
but
you
guys
have
to
believe
me
i
would
never
put
you
in
any
danger
if
i
thought
for
a
second
that
angel
was
going
to
hurt
anyone
you
would
stop
him
like
you
did
last
time
with
ms
buffy
i
feel
that
when
it
comes
to
angel
you
can't
see
straight
and
that's
why
we're
we're
all
gonna
help
you
face
this
but
he's
better
now
i
swear
look
you
guys
he's
the
one
that
found
the
glove
of
myhnegon
hhe's
keeping
it
safe
for
us
in
the
mansion
right
great
plan
leave
tons
of
firepower
with
the
scary
guy
and
leave
us
to
clean
up
the
mess
you
would
just
love
an
excuse
to
hurt
him
wouldn't
you
i
don't
need
an
excuse
i
think
lots
of
dead
people
actually
constitutes
a
reason
right
this
is
all
nobility
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
jealousy
hello
miss
notoveryourselfyet
don't
you
start
with
me
giles
no
one's
doing
the
'i'
statements
that's
enough
everybody
now
buffy
knows
our
concerns
and
her
actions
however
illadvised
can
be
understood
our
priority
right
now
is
to
retrieve
the
glove
of
myhnegon
and
try
to
destroy
it
now
all
of
you
back
to
classes
thanks
for
the
bail
in
there
i
know
this
is
a
lot
to
absorb
but
angel
did
find
the
glove
and
that
was
a
good
be
quiet
i
won't
remind
you
that
the
fate
of
the
world
often
lies
with
the
slayer
what
would
be
the
point
nor
shall
i
remind
you
that
you've
jeopardized
the
lives
of
all
that
you
hold
dear
by
harboring
a
known
murderer
but
sadly
i
must
remind
you
that
angel
tortured
me
for
hours
for
pleasure
you
should
have
told
me
he
was
alive
you
didn't
you
have
no
respect
for
me
or
the
job
i
perform
a
word
of
advice
vampires
rarely
knock
especially
in
daylight
oh
right
so
this
is
your
home
yeah
the
decorator
actually
just
left
faith
do
you
know
who
the
spartans
were
wild
stab
a
bunch
of
guys
from
spart
they
were
the
fiercest
warriors
known
to
ancient
greece
and
they
lived
in
quarters
very
much
like
these
do
you
know
why
because
a
true
fighter
needs
nothing
else
i'm
going
to
be
very
hard
on
you
faith
i
will
not
brook
insolence
or
laziness
and
i
will
not
allow
blunders
like
last
night's
attack
you
will
probably
hate
me
a
great
deal
of
the
time
you
think
but
i
will
make
you
a
better
slayer
and
that
will
keep
you
alive
you
have
to
trust
that
i
am
right
god
only
knows
what
mr
giles
has
been
filling
your
head
with
giles
is
okay
his
methods
are
unfathomable
to
me
i
find
him
entirely
confounding
but
that
is
not
important
let
him
have
his
games
and
secret
meetings
what
meetings
oh
i
don't
know
something
with
buffy
and
her
friends
oh
right
i
guess
that
doesn't
include
me
and
why
does
he
let
her
socialize
so
much
it
hardly
seems
no
matter
would
you
like
to
do
some
training
training
as
in
kicking
and
punching
and
stabbing
yes
that's
the
idea
i'm
your
girl
hey
hey
so
on
a
scale
of
one
to
a
million
how
much
are
you
hating
me
right
now
zero
you
were
scared
you
kept
a
secret
you
know
that'sitit's
okay
i
mean
secrets
aren't
bad
you
know
they're
normal
they're
better
than
normal
they're
good
secrets
are
good
must
be
a
reason
why
we
keep
them
right
yeah
i
guess
so
are
you
going
to
the
bronze
tonight
or
uh
are
you
gonna
sneak
away
for
a
notsosecret
rendezvous
with
angel
none
of
the
above
i'm
gonna
try
and
kill
this
lagos
guy
peace
offering
to
giles
well
angel
has
the
glove
now
right
yep
but
lagos
doesn't
know
that
i
figure
sooner
or
later
he's
bound
to
show
up
at
that
crypt
looking
for
it
ah
but
instead
he
finds
a
buffy
in
a
notsogood
mood
that's
my
brilliant
plan
you
look
pissed
rough
day
tell
me
about
it
rather
just
shoot
don't
think
i
don't
know
what
you
and
your
pals
were
talking
about
behind
my
back
today
yeah
and
what
was
that
more
about
this
glove
deal
than
you're
saying
the
glove
of
myhnegon
right
how'd
you
like
a
hit
of
some
real
news
angel's
still
alive
the
vampire
back
in
town
saw
him
myself
toting
the
popular
and
famous
glove
angel
guy
like
that
with
that
kind
of
glove
could
kill
a
whole
mess
of
people
said
the
same
thing
to
buffy
myself
weird
how
she
didn't
seem
to
care
buffy
knew
he
was
alive
i
can't
believe
her
she
says
he's
clean
yeah
well
i
say
we
can't
afford
to
find
out
i
say
i
deal
with
this
problem
right
now
i
say
i
slay
can
i
come
you
wanted
to
see
me
mr
giles
yes
i
do
apologize
for
bringing
you
in
at
this
late
hour
please
a
good
watcher
must
be
awake
and
alert
at
all
hours
would
you
like
some
tea
god
yes
please
i'm
completely
knackered
i
spent
the
afternoon
training
with
faith
she
doesn't
lack
for
energy
she's
your
first
slayer
i
take
it
if
you're
questioning
my
qualifications
no
i'm
not
i
uh
have
the
utmost
respect
for
your
methods
in
my
own
american
way
i
also
have
the
glove
oh
not
actually
on
me
but
uh
i
believe
it's
safe
it's
in
a
mansion
on
crawford
street
aaa
friend
of
buffy's
is
keeping
it
there
well
we
must
get
to
it
immediately
hide
it
before
someone
else
finds
it
or
better
still
destroy
it
destroy
it
yes
ii
i
didn't
think
it
could
be
done
either
but
it
involves
transforming
fire
into
living
flame
and
immolating
the
glove
iiit's
complex
but
uh
i
believe
i
have
all
the
necessary
materials
well
i
must
say
mr
giles
good
show
good
show
indeed
um
not
to
downplay
my
own
slaying
abilities
which
in
some
circles
are
considered
formidable
but
shouldn't
faith
be
here
i
tried
calling
but
no
one
was
home
look
if
you're
feeling
any
demonophobia
please
splitting
is
totally
an
option
you're
not
the
one
in
trouble
with
giles
that's
true
how
long
do
you
think
he
can
stay
angry
at
me
anyway
the
emotional
marathon
man
yeah
i
can't
really
blame
him
it's
weird
though
now
that
my
secret
angel
it's
all
out
in
the
open
i
feel
better
well
sure
you
do
this
big
burden's
been
lifted
i
mean
keeping
secrets
is
a
lot
of
work
one
could
hypothetically
imagine
you
have
no
idea
none
whatsoever
but
can
i
ask
you
a
question
when
you
were
with
angel
and
nobody
knew
about
it
did
that
make
it
feel
you
know
sexier
somehow
not
really
it's
too
much
pressure
after
a
while
it
even
makes
the
fun
parts
not
so
fun
oh
what
makes
you
think
all
this
secret
stuff
is
sexy
anyway
nothing
i'm
just
wondering
gotta
keep
asking
the
big
old
questions
when
you're
blessed
with
this
girl's
thirst
for
knowledge
and
okay
there's
something
i
have
to
tell
you
what
okay
this
will
make
me
feel
better
right
you
know
i
always
consider
myself
a
good
person
floss
do
my
homework
never
cheat
but
lately
and
please
don't
judge
me
on
this
but
i
want
you
to
be
the
first
to
know
that

a
demon
behind

the
record
let
me
guess
gwendolyn

was
she
was
uh
kicked
out
by
the
council
a
couple
of
years

for
misuses
of
dark
power
they
swear
there
was
a
memo
well
i
better
go
little
more
damage
control
the
whole
angel
thing
is
so
weird
yes

the
place
looks
nice
yeah
it's
real
spartan
can
you
show
us
where
they
broke
in

that
as
good
look
gwendolyn
post
or
whoever
she
may
be
had
us
all
fooled
yeah
well
you
can't
trust
people

should've
learned

by
now
i
realize

is
gonna
sound
funny
coming
from
someone
that
just
spent
a
lot
of
time
kicking
your
face
but
you
can
trust
me
is
that
right
