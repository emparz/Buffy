many
girls
arriving

time

but
since
giles
has
the
coven
searching
for
other
slayersinwaiting

way
i
bet
we'll
be
seeing
a
lot
more
soon
enough
so
you're
saying
i
should
enjoy
having
this
bed
all
to
myself
as
long
as
i
can
it
is
starting
to
get
crowded
around
here
totally
and
with
this
many
girls
well
i'm
just
saying
if
we
don't
get
another
bathroom
in
this
house
soon
things
are
gonna
get
ugly
sounds
like
somebody
had
to
share
mirror
time
with
a
bunch
of
siblings
somebody
not
me
i
only
got
a
halfsister
and
we
didn't
have
to
share
her
bedroom
was
in
another
wing
of
the
house
wing
your
house
had
wings
yeah
just
a
couple
a
few
our
summer
home
in
the
hamptons
didn't
have
any
at
all
well
one
actually
huh
well
that's—that's
huh
but
never
mind
my
deal
what's
your
story
willow
i
mean
witchcraft
wow
that
sounds
newagey
no
it's
safe
to
say
that
what
i
practice
is
definitely
oldagey
so
show
me
a
trick
a
trick
you
know
pull
a
rabbit
out
of
something
or
make
something
float
uh
yeah
listen
kennedy
um
it's
almost
morning
we
really
need
to
get
some
sleep
hey
if
i
wanted
to
sleep
i'd
be
downstairs
catching
z's
with
the
other
girls
annabelle
was
all
control
your
fear
control
your
fear
meanwhile
she's
the
one
that
goes
scampering
off
right
into
that
turokhan
vampire
poor
annie
great
so
the
slayer
who's
supposed
to
protect
us
let
her
get
killed
she
didn't
let
her
annabelle
was
foolish
buffy
can't
be
faulted
by
arriving
too
late
it's
not
like
she
could've
stopped
it
i
mean
the
super
vampire
messed
her
up
pretty
good
no
lie
she
still
looked
like
a
big
bruise
when
i
got
here
and
that
was
already
like
the
day
after
and
why
isn't
she
back
yet
buffy
she
left
to
get
the
new
girl
over
an
hour
ago
mabye
she
ran
into
trouble
you
don't
think
she
was
too
late
again
maybe—
maybe
we
can
save
the
maybes
for
a
more
dayish
part
of
the
day
girls
potential
slayers
can
function
without
sleep
me
i'm
no
good
without
my
usual
90
minutes
i'm
with
him
keep
the
chatter
down
or
speak
up
so
i
can
hear
you
i'm
bored
episode
i
bored
you
guys
are
all
still
up
ah
who
needs
sleep
everybody
this
is
rona
hi
hi
rona
hey
rona
hey
rona
um
why
is
that
guy
tied
to
a
chair
the
question
you'll
soon
be
asking
is
why
isn't
he
gagged
molly
why
don't
you
show
our
new
houseguest
where
the
kitchen
is
i'm
sure
she's
hungry
after
her
travels
fair
enough
i'm
a
bit
peckish
meself
bit
what
as
well
that's
english
for
hungry
oh
here
i
thought
hungry
was
english
for
hungry
everything
all
right
she
had
a
welcoming
committee
so
the
first
knows
potential
slayers
are
making
their
way
here
i
must
warn
the
coven
to
be
cautious
the
first's
always
gonna
be
one
step
ahead
of
us
giles
i
need
to
know
how
to
stop
it
no
not
stop
it
hurt
it
i
want
to
hurt
it
real
bad
tell
me
how
i—i
don't
know
buffy
i've
exhausted
all
the
sources
i
have
left
with
little
result
the
watcher's
records
are
still
really
all
we
have
to
go
on
i
made
the
rounds
myself
tried
to
dig
up
anything
useful
from
the
demon
community
they're
a
community
now
what's
next
the
ladies'
auxiliary
the
ones
that
didn't
attack
me
didn't
know
anything
or
didn't
talk
either
way
we've
got
squat
well
squat's
not
gonna
cut
it
what
about
the
turokhan
the
vampire
time
forgot
time
may
have
forgotten
him
but
i
sure
won't
we
know
stakes
don't
kill
it
but
anything
in
those
ancient
books
about
what
does
sunlight
fire
germs
so
giles
with
that
thing
guarding
the
entrance
to
the
first's
crib
how
will
buffy
get
to
spike
i
really
hate
to
admit
this
but
he's
not
wrong
there's
no
way
we'll
be
able
to
help
spike
until
that
thing
is
out
of
the
way
spike
sorry
i'm
confused
he's
that
vampire
who's
been
killing
people
right
he's
the
one
you're
worried
about
helping
well
we
need
him
to—he's
the
one
that's
been—it's
complicated
chloe
i'm
chloe
she's
eve
it's
just
well
we've
been
talking
and
do
we
have
some
kind
of
plan
you
know
any
kind
of
plan
to
keep
us
from
dying
we're
working
on
it
there
is
one
avenue
that
we
haven't
tried
yet—
giles
beljoxa's
eye
and
exactly
what
part
of
town
is
that
avenue
in
i
told
you
no
whwhat
is
botox's
eye
beljoxa's
eye
it's
an
oracle
type
creature
that
exists
in
a
dark
dimension
internal
vortex
more
like
fun
not
really
no
the
point
is
only
demons
can
open
the
gateway
to
it
excuse
me
exdemon
here
you're
still
friends
in
the
fold
murderous
acquaintances
anyway
look
there's
no
reason
to
think
this
beljoxa's
eye
will
have
any
of
the
answers
we're
looking
for
i'll
take
anything
i
can
get
anya
please
we're
running
out
of
time
spike's
running
out
of
time
dreaming
of
me
again
aren't
you
poor
spike
he
still
thinks
i
believe
in
him
be
realistic
i
don't
even
believe
in
myself
at
least
not
enough
to
risk
my
skin
to
save
your
ass
not
enough
to
face
that
i'm
sorry
spike
but
you
need
to
accept
this
you
know
it
never
would've
worked
out
you
need
to
let
go
so
we
can
both
move
on
i
promise
soon
it'll
all
be—
she
will
come
for
me
she
will
come
for
me
she
will
come
for
me
no
i
won't
why
not
you
have
the
nerve
to
ask
me
that
come
on
torg

like
a
lifetime
ago

counting

broke
my
heart

a
heart

this
the
night

one
date

it
wasn't
even
a
date

be
invited

the
same
massacre
and—and
you
hit
on
me
after
i
had
a
few
i
remember
you

skip
the
nostalgia—
sorry

on

this
tiny
little
gateway
to
the
beljoxa's

have
sex

this
town
i
can't
even
give
it
away
come

change
your
mind

help
us
and
the
slayer

kill
your
clientele
and
burn
your
establishment
to
the
ground
ek'vola

stinking
gateway

here
right—
yeah
this
is
willow
althenea
hi
how's
the
coven
oh
i
miss
you
guys
still
working
out
that
pleiadian
spirit
conjuring
what
oh
ok
when
ow
watch
it
that's
my
joystick
hand
i'm
not
gonna
touch
that
one
ok
listen
up
andrew
i
don't
exactly
know
what
to
do
with
you
except
that
we
don't
have
time
to
babysit
a
hostage
especially
a
hostage
that's
gotten
more
than
a
little
ripe
so
i'm
here
to
tell
you
if
you
try
anything
try
to
run—
did
you
ever
see
the
movie
misery
six
times
but
the
book
was
scarier
than
the
movie
'cause
instead
of
crushing
his
foot
with
a
sledge
hammer
kathy
bates
chops
it
off
with—
i'll
be
good
buffy—word
from
the
underground
another
potential
arrived
in
town
the
day
before
yesterday
she's
at
the
sun
spot
motel
near
the
highway
the
day
before
yesterday
why
are
we
just
finding
out
about
it
now
bringers
killed
her
watcher
before
he
could
tell
anyone
he
sent
her
if
it
wasn't
for
a
particularly
powerful
seer
in
the
coven
we
wouldn't
even
know
about
it
now
ok
i
mean
there's
still
a
couple
of
hours
of
daylight
left
you
guys
should
be
safe
here
i'll
get
her
and
bring
her
back
i'll
go
with
you
all
right
retrieving
a
potential
let's
do
it
or
i
could
just
go
wash
up
where
are
they
going
bring
another
newbie
in
from
the
cold
another
one
well
the
more
the
better
i
figure
we
need
all
the
help
we
can
get
help
sure
that's
cool
but—
what
i'm
just
not
sure
more
scared
slayer
wannabes
translates
as
help
what—what
are
we
all
doing
here
it's
called
training
didn't
your
watcher
ever
teach
you
the
word
i
never
had
a
watcher
i
only
just
found
out
what
i
was—or
what
i
might
be—after
those
crazyass
monks
came
after
me
i
meant
why
are
we
all
bothering
it's
not
like
we
can
make
a
difference
we've
gotta
try
we
gotta
keep
our
reflexes
sharp
we
have
to
be
ready
if
something
comes
down—
no
something's
already
come
down
she's
right
and
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
it
i
mean
i've
never
seen
a
real
vampire
in
my
whole
life
much
less
slayed
one
i've
seen
one
well
my
watcher
once
showed
me
a
photograph
of
one
a
blurry
photograph
that's
what
i'm
saying
not
one
of
us
is
remotely
prepared
to
be
activated
as
a
new
chosen
one
i
feel
pretty
prepared
excuse
the
newness
of
me
but
uh
just
so
i
understand
if
a
slayer
dies—
well
when
the
slayer
dies
i
mean
nobody
lives
forever
right
then
one
of
us—
get's
activated
uhhuh
i
prefer
called
i
heard
there's
more
than
one
more
than
one
what
slayer
there's
another
one—somewhere
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
like
any
of
this
does
no
matter
how
many
there
are
one
of
us
is
gonna
be
the
next
slayer
with
the
weight
of
the
world
on
her
shoulders
it
won't
be
me
i
mean
not
now
i
mean
i'm
too
young
doesn't
work
that
way
in
fact
the
younger
the
better
in
fact
i'm
starting
to
think
it
might
be
too
late
for
me
never
too
late
it
could
be
anyone
especially
since
there's
so
few
of
us
left
they'll
just
run
through
each
one
of
us
one
after
the
other
kinda
creepy
huh
all
we
do
is
wait
around
for
each
other
to
die
you
sure
this
is
it
the
clerk
said
it's
the
only
checkin
they've
had
in
a
week
tourism
must
be
down
right
in
the
middle
of
apocalypse
season
hello
it's
ok
we're
friendly
and
we
have
eyes
buffy—kick
the
door
down
she's
cold
been
dead
for
days
poor
kid
she
made
it
all
the
way
to
sunnydale
just
to
get
herself
killed
if
only
we—
eve
eve
who's
in
our
house
just
my
personal
opinion
but
i
don't
think
the
slayer
can
protect
us
from
the
first
ok
here's
another
interesting
thing
how
come
the
slayer's
always
a
girl
i
dunno
'cause
girls
are
cooler
i
think
a
guy
slayer
would
be
badass
like—like
if
there
was
this
ninja
a
guy
slayer
would
be
like
you
may
be
silent
but
this'll
shut
you
up
hiya
buffy
could
stomp
ninja
ass
the
silent
warrior
ha
ha—i
think
not
she
can't
even
slay
that
special
vampire
everyone's
saying
well
everyone
should
shut
up
and
you
should
stop
pretending
anybody
here
is
your
friend
and
also
why's
she
so
about
saving
spike
he's
a
worse
killer
than
me
by
a
way
lot
spike
was
being
controlled
by
the
first
and
he
has
a
soul
now
besides
we
need
his
help
what
about
me
did
it
ever
occur
to
anyone
that
i
could
be
a
lot
more
useful
around
here
i
used
to
be
an
evil
genius
hello
and
what
was
your
genius
thing
well
um
raising
demons
mostly
ok
so
not
for
now
but
also
there
was
planning
there
were
um
blueprints
i
can
be
in
this
kicking
it
righteous
yeah
oh
oh
yeah
buffy
said
if
you
talked
enough
i'm
allowed
to
kill
you
not
even
even
license
to
kill
huh
pretty
cool
you
know
timothy
dalton
never
got
his
props
'cause
he
came
in
at
the
end
of
an
old
regime
but
he
had
it
goin'
on
he
went
rogue
with
the
broccolis
they
were
just
treading
water
stylistically
is
there
a
language
that
you're
speaking
i'm
so
alone
then
maybe
you
shouldn't've
killed
your
only
friend
i
hate
that
you
don't
even
know
i
don't
plan
to
the
slayer's
not
getting
it
done
i
have
got
my
ear
to
the
ground
and
that's
the
word
do
you
wanna
play
kevin
bacon
buffy
what
is
it
get
away
from
them
who
get
away
from
who
what's
the
problem
officer
i
said
get
away
from
them
now
buffy

thanks
for
the
slumber
party

last
couple
of
nights

learned
a
whole
lot—
shut
up
and
get
out
or
you'll
do
what
i'll
be
sending
a
guest
over
to
visit

and
make
him
feel
welcome
before
he
rips
y'all
to
pieces
bye
i
need
to
go
wash
up
again
it
cannot
be
fought
it
cannot
be
killed
the
first
evil
has
been
and
always
will
be
since
before
the
universe
was
born
long
after
there
is
nothing
else
it
will
go
on
i
refuse
to
believe
that
there
must
be
some
way
to
destroy
it
what
am
i
talking
to
myself
here
there's
no
way
ok
we
tried
let's
go
giles
are
you
saying
that
the
first
will
succeed
in—in
wiping
out
the
line
of
slayers
the
eye
sees
not
the
future
only
the
truth
of
the
now
and
before
yes
we've
all
got
that—it's
called
memory
can
you
help
us
out
with
something
a
little
bit
more
demony
if
the
first
has
been
around
for
all
time
then
why
hasn't
it
attempted
something
like
this
before
why
now
the
opportunity
has
only
recently
presented
itself
opportunity
the
mystical
forces
surrounding
the
chosen
line
have
become
irrevocably
altered
become
unstable
vulnerable
something
the
first
did
the
first
evil
did
not
cause
the
disruption
only
seized
upon
it
to
extinguish
the
lives
of
the
chosen
forever
then
what
has
caused
the
disruption
what—what
is
responsible
for
letting
this
happen
the
slayer
we
should
run
and
go
where
vi
annabelle
ran
look
where
it
got
her
safer
in
than
out
how
can
you
say
that
it
was
here
buffy
in
the
house
living
with
us
for
days
and
you
didn't
even
know
it
well
none
of
us
knew
it
it
could
still
be
here
it
could
be
any
one
of
us
no
the
first
can
only
take
the
form
of
dead
people
yeah
well
there'll
be
plenty
more
of
those
soon
enough
we're
dropping
like
flies
here
hey
look
i
know
you're
all
scared
you
know
what
i
am
too
but
giles
and
anya
will
be
back
soon
and
hopefully
they
will
have
the
information
that
we
need
to
stop
the
first
in
the
mean
time
we
need
to
stick
together
ok
we're
stronger
that
way
we
cannot
afford
to
fall
apart
now
she's
right
where
would
the
justice
league
have
been
if
they
hadn't
put
their
differences
aside
to
stop
the
imperium
and
his
shapeshifting
alien
horde
don't
help
me
buff
the
sun
goes
down
and
ubervamp's
on
its
way
so
a
plan'd
be
good
right
about
now
will
i'm
sorry
to
ask
but—
i
know
we
need
a
barrier
a
major
one
something
tells
me
this
vampire
doesn't
need
an
invite
to
get
into
the
house
can
you
do
it
i'll
try
try
you
heard
her
buff
are
you
sure
about
willow
doing
the
hocus
pocus
again
i—i
mean
last
time
she—
xander
we
don't
have
a
lot
of
choices
and
what
if
that
doesn't
work
what
if
that
monster
gets
through
then
we'll
deal
deal
fight
you
mean
how
are
we
supposed
to
do
that
and
with
what
with
whatever
it
takes
right
buffy
you
fought
the
turokhan
and
it
almost
killed
you
and
you're
the
real
slayer
whwhat
chance
do
we
have
honestly
you
staked
that
thing
and
it
didn't
die
no
but
that
doesn't—
maybe
it
can't
be
killed
that
mean
we
shouldn't
try
there's
that
word
again
hey
it's
a
good
word
give
up
can
we
do
that
surrender
i
mean
so
it
won't
kill
us
what
i
said
trying
is
good
i
just
thought
it
beared
repeating
um
and
exactly
how
many
ubervamps
were
at
the
geneva
convention
come
on
we're
all
potential
slayers
you
know
how
to
fight
even
if
you
don't
know
how
you
know
it
fighting's
one
thing
winning's
another
i
don't
want
to
die
the
time
has
come
for
all
good
children
to
say
good
night
take
'em
all
except
for
her
well
alone
again
i
just
love
having
you
all
to
myself
there's
more
of
them
now
and
two
more
out
back
why
aren't
they
doing
anything
attacking
they
don't
want
in
they're
here
to
make
sure
we
don't
get
out
rona
like
this'll
do
any
good
i
mean
what's
the
point
it's
this
end
right
here
just
stick
that
in
the
bad
guys
any
more
questions
this'll
do
me
are
you
sure
you
know
how
to
use
it
since
i
was
eight
can
i
have
something
come
on
the
turokhan's
coming
for
me
too
you
know
i
have
a
right
to
defend
myself—
if
you
say
so
facing
my
fear
i'm
facing
my
fear
hear
that
fear
i'm
facing
you
wow
you
really
can
float
stuff
just
testing
oh
right
heard
this
voodoo
once
turned
you
into
the
big
scary
big
scary
willow—that's
something
i'd
almost
like
to
see—
no
you
wouldn't
i
said
almost
i
needed
to
make
sure
last
time
i
tried
using
magic
the
first—it
turned
it
around
on
me
got
inside
i
felt
it
just
surging
through
me
every
fiber
of
my
being
pure
undiluted
evil
i
could
taste
it
how's
evil
taste
a
little
chalky
guys
something's
happening
oh
my
god
here
it
comes
caerimonia
minerva
saepio
saepire
saepsi
um
deflector
shields—deflector
shields
up
willow—
saepio
impedimentum
it's
working
for
the
moment
will—
it's—it's
strong
it's
hurting
her
hang
on
willow
i
don't
know
she
can't
hold
it
what
do
we
do
what
do
we
do
run
everybody
run
come
on
are
you
all
right
yeah
i
just—i
don't
understand
how
buffy's
death
mucked
up
the
whole
slayer
mojo
you
know
it's
not
like
she
hasn't
died
before
it's
not
because
she
died
the
beljoxa's
eye
was
quite
clear
about
that
in
its
enigmatic
way
it's
because
she
lives
again
buffy's
not
responsible
for
that
oh
oh
willow
and
me
and
xander
and
tara
we're
the
ones
who
brought
buffy
back
we're—we're
the
reason
the
first
is
here
the
reason
those
girls
were
murdered
no
it's
our
fault
the
would
would've
been
better
off
if
buffy
had
just
stayed
dead
ok
no
bringers
following
i
guess
they'll
save
us
for
old
snaggletooth
where
is
the
turokhan
right
behind
us
time
to
split
up
split
up
we're
splittin'
up
is
that
wise
willow
take
everyone
and
find
a
safe
location
i
know
a
place
what
are
you
gonna
do
gonna
try
to
slow
the
turok
down
lead
him
away
from
you
guys
get
him
to
chase
me
buffy
you
can't
take
that
thing
on
yourself
i'll
stay
no
hhey
i
need
that
willow
xander
take
everyone
to
a
safe
location
get
'em
out
of
here
now
have
to
go
dawnie
come
on
people
we
gotta
move
i'm
moving
climbing's
not
my
thing
i
got
a
inner
ear
condition
is
falling
your
thing
'cause
if
you
don't
pick
up
the
pace
i'm
gonna
come
up
there
and
drop
your
ass
way
to
keep
up
morale
in
a
crisis
no
wonder
buffy's
the
leader
some
leader
this
is
crazy
you
got
that
right
what
are
we
doing
down
here
quieter
faster
where
are
we
future
site
of
the
new
public
library
opening
up
may
2003
if
i
ever
get
back
to
work
that
is
you
call
this
a
safe
location
it's
the
middle
of
nothing
this'll
do
ok
everyone
spread
out
take
positions
um
what's
my
position
and
don't
make
a
sound
that's
the
plan
spread
out
that
thing
is
gonna
kill
buffy
and
then
it's
gonna
come
after
us
for
all
we
know
it's
killing
her
right
now
or
it
could
just
skip
that
part
and
come
straight
here
oh
no
no
no
no
buffy
what's
she
doing
just
watch
it's
show
time
looks
good
doesn't
it
they're
trapped
in
here
terrified
meat
for
the
beast
and
there's
nothing
they
can
do
but
wait
that's
all
they've
been
doing
for
days
waiting
to
be
picked
off
having
nightmares
about
monsters
that
can't
be
killed
but
i
don't
believe
in
that
i
always
find
a
way
i'm
the
thing
that
monsters
have
nightmares
about
and
right
now
you
and
me
are
gonna
show
'em
why
it's
time
welcome
to
thunderdome
two
men
enter
one
man
leaves
this—you
planned
this
letting
the
barrier
fail
bringing
us
here
you
and
buffy
honestly
you
staked
that
thing
and
it
didn't
die
no
but
that
doesn't—
maybe
it
can't
be
killed
willow
can
you
hear
me
yeah
we're
losing
them
we
can't
let
that
happen
i
have
an
idea
grab
xander
xander
what
i
said
i
just
thought
it
beared
repeating
i
gotta
slay
the
neandervamp
to
get
spike
outta
that
cave
but
i
need
those
girls
to
see
me
do
it
i
get
it
but
this
isn't
the
best
venue
for
a
smackdown
we
can
whine
like
little
wusses
or
we
can
get
off
our
asses
and
fight
i
know
just
the
place
it's
killing
her
we
have
to
do
something
wait
see
dust
just
like
the
rest
of
'em
i
don't
know
what's
coming
next
but
i
do
know
it's
gonna
be
just
like
this
hard
painful
but
in
the
end
it's
gonna
be
us
if
we
all
do
our
parts
believe
it
we'll
be
the
ones
left
standing
here
endeth
the
lesson
a
knife
now
is
it
what'llwhat'll
thatyou—you
can't
hurt
me
you're—you're
just
a
bloody
figment
you
are
you're
just
you
oh
