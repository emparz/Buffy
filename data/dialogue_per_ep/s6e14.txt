a
followup

been
a
lot
of
loss

a
tendency
to
go
away
and
i
miss
them

wish
i
could
just
make
them
stop
going
away
but
seriously
it's
it's
no
big
deal
i'm
fine

i
was

to
ever
think
you
could

hang
out
with

friends
and
i
was
insane
to
think
no
wait
you
were
right
you're
insane
oh
hi
hey
breakfast
didn't
really
plan
for
a
sleepover

iit's
like
i
wanna

exactly
i
think
it's
time
for
you
to
go
yeah
well
can't
daylight
okay
i'll
go
i'll
get
the
door
fine
fine
i'm
actually
trying
to
move
right
now
me
too
well
this
can't
be
good
there's
something
keeping
us
in
this
house
or
someone
has
everyone
tried
to
get
out
what
if
we
just
like
as
a
group
got
up
and
and
threw
ourselves
at
the
door
all
right
count
of
three
one
two
three
here
we
go
hence
the
problem
i
really
need

i
have
a
job

i
have
to
open
the
magic
box

have
a
shift
at
the
doublemeat
actually

here
yeah
i'm
i'm
fine
willow
and
tara
have
class
i
gotta
be
at
the
site
i
know
i
know
we
all
have
places
that
we'd
rather
be
things
we'd
rather
be
doing
i
think
the
first
priority
has
to
be
to
find
a
way
out
sure
of
course
you
all
wanna
leave
'cause
being
stuck
in
here
with
me
that
would
really
suck
right
no
dawnie
it's
just
we
have
more
important
things
to
do
yeah
i
know
important
whatever
that
means
right
dawn
what
did
you
do
something
me
do
you
know
something
'cause
we
want
you
to
feel
like
you
can
tell
us
what
would
i
know
look
we're
not
accusing
you
of
anything
it's
just
you
were
kind
of
taking
it
personal
down
there
oh
okay
so
you've
all
just
decided
that
somehow
i'm
responsible
great
here's
me
baskin'
in
the
love
no
it's
just
you
know
you're
upset
'cause
we
all
wanna
leave
and
now
we
can't
leave
only
thing
missing
is
a
cornfield
there
there
isn't
a
cornfield
is
there
dawnie
it's
okay
you
know
we're
not
gonna
be
mad
yeah
only
i
didn't
do
anything
you
sure
you
want
me
to
ask
my
other
self
dawn
we're
just
trying
to
figure
out
what's
going
on
figure
it
out
yourself
i'm
done
being
talked
to
like
a
kid
well
'cause
you
know
sometimes
we
do
something
that
seems
like
a
good
idea
at
the
time
like
say
invoke
the
power
of
a
musical
amulet
and
it
turns
out
you
know
not
so
much
god
i
didn't
do
anything
i
wish
i
had
i'm
glad
you're
trapped
how
else
can
i
get
anybody
to
spend
any
time
with
me
dawn
if
you
want
us
to
spend
time
with
you
i
don't
get
out
get
out
get
out
get
out
i
think
she's
possessed
she's
a
teenager
phones
are
all
out
we're
totally
cut
off
she's
just
so
angry
it
happens
we
all
went
through
it
i
know
i
just
can't
figure
out
why
she
didn't
come
to
me
well
you
have
been
a
little
busy
lately
hey
i
don't
wanna
keep
you
all
from
the
touchyfeelies
but
maybe
the
encounter
group
can
meet
later
say
when
we're
not
trapped
in
a
house
even
if
dawn
does
know
something
she's
obviously
not
gonna
help
us
right
now
we
need
another
way
i
think
magic's
gonna
be
our
best
bet
something
general
you
know
cast
a
wide
net
but
willow
no
i'll
do
it
it's
just
oobviously
i
didn't
bring
any
supplies
well
we
don't
have
any
in
the
house
we
got
rid
of
everything
actually
not
everything
i
uh
might
have
kept
one
or
or
two
things
sort
of
just
in
case
that's
great
in
a
very
bad
way
just
bring
me
what
you
have
but
i'm
doing
this
alone
you
need
to
stay
away
from
it
so
we're
supposed
to
just
wait
it
won't
take
long
all
right
somebody
wanna
tell
me
what's
what's
going
on
here
we're
trapped
in
a
house
by
by
what
some
unseen
force
or
something
who
knows
what
she's
doing
in
there
and
i
have
to
tell
you
i
don't
think
that's
a
skin
condition
release
try
the
door
no
can't
what
the
bloody
hell
was
that
that's
the
demon
i
killed
two
nights

fine
stay
with
spike
it's
not
like
i
meant
for
this
to
happen
i
never
said
that
you
did
i
didn't
want
this
what
did
you
want
nothing
dawn
come
on
no
you
don't
know
you
have
this
thing
you
do
you
have
all
these
friends
you
have
no
idea
what
it's
like
what
are
you
talking
about
i
don't
know
what
what
being
alone
you're
not
alone
then
why
do
i
feel
like
this
i
just
think
we
haven't
thought
of
the
right
way
out
yet
that's
all
well
we
can't
just
stay
put
like
cattle
waiting
for
that
thing
to
pop
out
every
time
it
gets
peckish
i'd
say
we
do
another
spell
but
i
i
think
we've
tried
everything
well
that's
not
completely
true
is
it
i
mean
not
everything
not
exactly
we're
sitting
here
with
an
incredibly
powerful
witch
much
more
powerful
than
you
tara
i'm
sorry
only
no
one
seems
willing
to
say
it
i
can't
no
see
that's
not
exactly
true
either
not
can't
won't
you
don't
know
how
much
i
hate
this
i
don't
know
if
there's
even
anything
i
could
do
yes
and
a
good
way
to
find
out
is
to
sit
around
and
try
nothing
that
was
sarcasm
by
the
way
look
it's
dangerous
and
so
is
all
of
us
dying
will
look
i
don't
wanna
gang
up
on
you
but
anya
kinda
has
a
point
we
brought
you
back
from
it
once
we're
all
here
it's
just
one
little
spell
whatever
happens
we
can
bring
you
back
again
no
i
can't
if
i
start
i
i
might
not
be
able
to
stop
and
whose
fault
is
that
you
know
if
you
hadn't
gotten
so
much
of
this
in
your
system
in
the
first
place
hey
you're
gonna
back
off
she
said
no
and
that's
it
you're
not
gonna
make
her
do
something
that
she
doesn't
want
to
and
if
you
try
you're
gonna
have
to
go
through
me
first
understood
fine
if
you
all
aren't
willing
to
get
us
out
of
this
then
i
will
do
it
myself
i
wish
you
would
have
told
me
you
haven't
really
been
what
i
haven't
been
what
around
dawn
the
most
important
job
that
i
have
is
looking
out
for
you
you
sound
like
my
guidance
counselor
she
give
you
a
handbook
or
something
'talkin'
to
the
troubled
teen'
counselor
it
wasn't
my
idea
i
didn't
even
know
we
had
guidance
counselors
she
called
me
out
of
class
like
i
was
a
total
jd
and
you'd
never
met
her
before
no
not
until
yesterday
and
she
got
you
to
start
talking
about
things
that
bothered
you
at
home
uh
yeah
you
didn't
by
any
chance
happen
to
express
like
a
a
wish
oror
something
to
her
um
maybe
just
a
little
honey
come
on
this
isn't
the
way
calm
down
she
knows
something
she
knows
something
we
have
to
find
out
what
it
is
hey
ahn
just
stop
for
a
second
there's
gotta
be
a
clue
in
here
somewhere
stop
it
anya
it
wasn't
her
fault

half
this
stuff
is
from
the
magic
box
how
could
you
do
this
i
work
hard
at
that
store
and
i
helped
you
i
took
care
of
you
this
is
how
you
say
'thank
you'
anya
hold
on
okay
tell
her
you
didn't
do
this
tell
her
it's
a
mistake
no
oh
buffy
how
are
we
supposed
to
trust
you
dawn
i
mean
you

say
you
didn't
put
us
here
but
look
at
this
stuff
how
are
we
supposed
to
believe
you
look
ii
don't
think
she
i
don't
think
it's
all
her
fault
okay
she
there
was
a
guidance
counselor
or
someone
pretending
to
be
a
guidance
counselor
she
she
made
dawn

a
wish
guidance
counselor

made
a
wish
to
someone
you've
never
seen
before

only
one
who

punished
men
who
wronged
women
oh
that
was
anya's
little
raison
d'être
most
of
us
try
to
be
a
little
more
wellrounded
and
actually
we
prefer
'justice
demon'
okay
fyi
wellrounded
huh
is
that
how
you
explain
your
thing
for
bad
parents
oh
it's
not
a
thing
the
children
need
me
hmm
addy
issue
sling
all
the
little
barbs
at
me
that
you
want
anyanka
it
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
this
girl
was
in
pain
and
none
of
you
could
hear
it
i
could
hear
her
crying
out
everywhere
i
went
in
this
town
it
was
unbearable
and
none
of
you
knew
you
people
deserve
to
be
cursed
enjoy
your
time
together
from
now
on
all
you
have
is
time
time
and
each
other
good
luck
wait

wait
time
and
each
other
it's
the
curse
hallie
oh
for
crying
out
loud
fine
the
curse
is
lifted
we
can
all
leave
now
damn
it
thanks
for
before
and
and
for
taking
this
stuff
with
you
no
problem
just
so
you
know
ii
was
never
gonna
use
it
i
mean
not
really
i
i
just
kept
it
like
a
safety
net
'cause
there
was
always
this
thing
in
the
back
of
my
head
this
you
know
voice
saying
like
'what
if
things
get
bad
i
mean
really
bad
and
what
if
you
can't
handle
it'
aand
it
made
me
panic
so
that's
why
i
kept
a
couple
of
things
i
kept
them
so
ii
didn't
have
to
think
about
it
so
i
could
focus
on
on
getting
better
i
get
it
ii
really
do
but
it's
time
to
work
without
the
net
will
you
know
i
don't
know
if
you
noticed
but
it
actually
did
get
bad
in
there
really
bad
and
and
you
still
said
no
you
have
some
weird
friends
news
from
the
file
marked
'duh'
we're
gonna
get
him
to
the
er
and
then
we're
gonna
talk
about
payment
and
dawnie
there
are
two
words
i
want
you
to
get
used
to
punitive
damages
think
it's
worn
off
just
one
thing
to
do
okay
who's
pushing
wow
look
at
the
stars
good
party
i
just
wanna
run
barefoot
on
the
grass
so
i
can
feel
the
dewdrops
between
my
god
look
at
the
stars
