bleedin'
crime
is
what
it
is
jackin'
up
the
bar
price
to
pay
for
fixin'
up
this
sinkhole
not
my

insurance

act
of

gee
maybe
it's
time
you
found
a
new
place
to
patronize
i've
half
a
mind
to
especially
since
the
flowering
onion
got
remodeled
off
the
sodding
menu
's
the
only
thing
this
place
had
going
for
it
what
are
you
doing
wha
what
do
you
mean
what
am
i

here
at
this
table
talking
to
me
like
we're
some
kind
of
talking
buddies
well
i
saw
you
sitting
here
alone
thought
i
don't
know
you
could
maybe
do
with
a
bit
of
uh
you
know
company

yourself
although
it's
just
we
took
on
that
glory
chippie
together
i
was
right
there
with
you
fightin'
the
fight
actually
you
were
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
knocked
unconscious
still
points
for
intent
you'd
think
that
would
be
enough
to
cut
me
a
sliver
of
slack
earn
a
little
consideration
respect
hey
uh
evil
dead
you're
in
my
seat
bugger
it
xander
i
think
you
may
have
hurt
his
feelings
and
you
should
never
hurt
the
feelings
of
a
brutal
killer
you
know
that's
uh
that's
actually
some
pretty
good
advice

some
more
liquid
refreshments

buying
for
i
am

and
another
runin
with
her
and
my
headaches
and
nosebleeds
are
gonna
be
the
least
of
our
problems
you
know
what
this
is
the
first
r'n'r
i've
had
in
weeks
how
about
we
go
one
night
without
saying
the
name
glory
i'm
down
with
that
let's
just
call
'she
who
will
not
be
named'
another
name
let's
just
call
her
ben
for
example
i'll
be
right
back
ben
hey
buffy
hi
i
barely
recognized
you
without
your
hospital
scrubs
oh
you'd
be
surprised
the
extent
of
my
wardrobe
really
i
actually
have
entire
outfits
that
aren't
blue
pajamas
um
my
sister
uh
told
me
what
happened
at
the
hospital
before
i
got
there
uh
huh
and
uh
i
just
wanted
to
say
thanks
for
looking
after
her
that's
okay
i'm
glad
dawn's
all
right
the
point
is
i
work
hard
for
that
money
and
you're
saying
i
didn't
you
stole
it
and
you're
making
it
into
very
hard
work
listen
bleach
boy
i
don't
have
a
chip
in
my
head
i
can
do
far
more
damage
to
you
than
you
can
ever
do
to
me
yeah
like
you
could
ever
hurt
me
sunnydale
station
last
stop
this
line
oh
god
oh
please
help
me
somebody
please
help
me
buffy
i'm
back
by
popular
demand
did
you
have
a
nice
time
you
know
i
think
i
did
muchneeded
fun
apart
from
willow's
headaches
and
spike's
cameo
appearance
spike
was
there
unfortunately
well
i'm
relieved
that
you're
home
because
to
be
honest
i
wasn't
feeling
all
that
safe
with
you
gone
at
first
and
then
i
um
remembered
that
um
rupert
was
here
and
i
felt
much
much
safer
yes
well
thank
you
for
the
little
backpedal
but
uh
i'm
forced
to
agree
that
i'm
barely
an
adequate
substitute
for
a
slayer
in
the
house
good
night
good
night
so
how
is
dawn
she's
uh
she's
coping
very
well
extremely
well
really
considering
the
extraordinary
circumstances
of
her
origin
then
lemme
ask
you
something
um
we've
been
going
easy
on
her
the
last
week
letting
things
slide
oh
i
don't
think
that's
at
all
wise
you
don't
no
the
best
thing
you
can
do
now
is
behave
exactly
as
you
always
have
any
special
treatment
at
this
stage
is
likely
to
undermine
dawn's
sense
of
normality
you
think
so
absolutely
thanks
dawn
what
what
did
i
tell
you
about
borrowing
my
clothing
i
didn't
take
your
clothes
bull
i
never
touched
your
stuff
really
then
what
happened
to
my
blue
cashmere
sweater
spikey
aren't
you
coming
to
bed
i'm
not
tired
me
neither
don't
you
wanna
come
in
and
tire
me
out
harm

really
not
in
the
mood
right
now
you're
never
in
the
mood
we
could
do
something
different
tonight
like
what
you
stop
yammering
for
two
seconds
well
we
could
i
don't
know
maybe
play
a
game
oh
i'm
gonna
stake
you
i'm
coming
after
you
you
bad
evil
vampire
and
i'm
gonna
slay
you
i'm
sneaking
up
and
i'm
going
to
stake
you
so
much
with
my
slaying
powers
that
i
have
because
i'm
the
chosen
oh
spike
i
just
don't
see
why
he
couldn't
end
up
with
esmerelda
they
could
have
the
wedding
right
there
beneath
the
very
belltower
where
he
labored
thanklessly
for
all
those
years
no
see
it
can't
it
can't
end
like
that
'cause
all
of
quasimodo's
actions
were
selfishly
motivated
he
had
no
moral
compass
no
understanding
of
right
everything
he
did
he
did
out
of
love
for
a
woman
who
would
never
be
able
to
love
him
back
also
you
can
tell
it's
not
gonna
have
a
happy
ending
when
the
main
guy's
all
bumpy
what
did
you
think
buffy
the
test
isn't
till
tomorrow
right
i
don't
have
an
opinion
till
then
but
you
read
it
right
kinda
not
i
rented
the
movie
oh
with
um
with
charles
laughton
i
don't
know
was
he
one
of
the
singing
gargoyles
oh
boy
what
i
i'm
kidding
you're
done
with
this
yeah
hi
uh
kind
of
reading
that
'six
found
murdered
on
train
at
sunnydale
station'
glory
'unconfirmed
reports
of
severe
trauma
to
the
throats
of
one
or
more
of
the
victims'
survey
says
vampire
oh
it's
you
what
are
you
doing
here
lurking
about
i'm
not
lurking
i'm
looking
what
are
you
doing
nothing
so
is
that
how
you
get
around
town
in
the
daytime
i
mean
does
that
lead
into
the
sewers
or
something
can
you
show
me
no
why
are
you
does
buffy
know
you're
here
yeah
right
'cause
nothing
would
make
her
happier
than
to
find
out
i'm
hanging
out
after
school
in
the
vampire's
lair
especially
yours
go
home
then
i
don't
feel
like
it
right
now
well
you
can't
bloody
well
stay
here
why
not
because
i've
got
things
to
do
bad
evil
things
that
are
not
for
a
child's
eyes
i'm
not
a
child
i'm
not
even
human
not
originally
yeah
well
originally
i
was
i
got
over
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
it
matters
very
much
how
you
start
out
that's
smart
i
get
that
i
like
how
you
talk
to
me
like
i
can
understand
things
everyone
else
is
being
all
twitchy
and
secretive
they're
just
trying
to
keep
you
safe
i
expect
i
feel
safe
with
you
take
that
back
i
i
mean
you
have
that
whole
superpower
thing
and
you're
just
as
tough
as
buffy
is
maybe
tougher
buffy
thinks
so
too
she
does
well
she's
always
worried
about
what
she's
gonna
do
if
you
ever
get
that
chip
out
of
your
head
is
that
right
so
um
what
else
does
buffy
say
about
me
hey
dawn
no
it's
me
is
dawn
with
you
isn't
she
here
no
she
didn't
come
home
from
school
today
oh
buffy
the
news
said
something
about
people
murdered
it's
not
glory
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
dawn
i
promise
look
she
probably
i'll
find
her
and
the
lady
just
invited
you
in
well
i
had
hubby
by
the
throat
didn't
i
promised
her
he'd
live
if
she
gave
me
the
invite
and
did
you
let
him
live
what
do
you
think
huh
too
much
for
you
no
keep
going
and
i
kill
'em
right
quick
the
whole
lot
but
there's
someone
missing
supposed
to
be
this
little
girl
so
i
get
real
quiet
and
i
hear
this
tiny
noise
coming
from
the
coal
bin
this
little
sigh
so
i
listened
harder
it's
very
very
quiet
oh
bloody
hell
spike
i
need
your
help
dawn
is
here
spike
was
just
telling
a
story
aand
he
was
just
at
this
really
cool
part
what
the
hell
is
this
what
is
she
doing
here
just
hanging
out
here
can
you
please
let
him
finish
the
story
then
you
could
do
the
lecture
yeah
okay
let's
hear
the
story
that
spike
is
telling
my
little
sister
right
yeah
so
uh
i
knew
the
girl
was
in
the
coal
bin
so
i
rip
it
open
very
violent
haul
her
out
of
there

and
then
i
give
her
to
a
good
family
in
a
nice
home
where
they're
never
ever
mean
to
her
and
didn't
lock
her
in
the
coal
bin
what
that's
so
lame
i
was
just
about
to
send
her
home
i
knew
you'd
be
frettin'
dawn
get
your
stuff
we're
getting
out
of
here
why
doesn't
that
register
with
you
crypt
plus
vampire
equals
bad
'cause
it
was
spike
hanging
out
with
spike
is
not
cool
dawn
okay
it
is
it
is
dangerous
and
icky
i
don't
think
spike's
icky
yeah
well
think
again
sister
you
have
a
crush
on
him
no
i
don't
it's
just
he's
got
cool
hair
and
he
wears
cool
leather
coats
and
stuff
and
he
doesn't
treat
me
like
an
alien
he's
a
killer
dawn
you
cannot
have
a
crush
on
something
that
is
dead
and
and
evil
and
a
vampire
right
that's
why
you
were
never
with
angel
for
three
years
angel's
different
he
has
a
soul
spike
has
a
chip
same
diff
i
i
can't
listen
to
this
spike
is
a
monster
okay
aand
plus
you
are
only
fourteen
years
old
i
like
hanging
out
with
him
is
all
and
even
if
i
did
have
a
crush
he
wouldn't
notice
in
a
million
years
not
with
you
around
what
does
that
mean
spike's
totally
into
you
oh
come
on
you
didn't
notice
buffy
spike
is
completely
in
love
with
you
huh
so
tell
me
again
what
we're
looking
for
clues
oooohkay
could
you
give
me
a
clue
about
what
kind
of
clues
something
anything
just
wanna
know
this
was
a
vamp
attack
if
it
was
how
many
we're
talking
about
well
sunnydale's
finest
didn't
leave
us
a
lot
of
stuff
to
examine
who
knows
how
many
people
have
traipsed
through
here
xander
what
never
mind
iit's
just
that
dawn
said
that
yeah
forget
it
buffy
she
thinks
that
she
said
that

spike's
in
love
with
me
i'm
not
joking
oh
i
hope
not
it's
funnier
if
it's
true
i'm
serious
xander
this
is
serious
all
right
it's
creepy
no
not
creepy
'cause
it's
not
real
i
mean
how
upset
can
you
really
get
over
one
of
spike's
fevered
daydreams
that's
not
gonna
happen
i
guess
so
where
did
dawn
how
did
she
come
to
this
extremely
entertaining
conclusion
she
was
hanging
out
with
spike
i
think
she
has
a
crush
on
him
what
i
mean
i
always
knew
that
he
had
this
weird
fixation
with
me
i'm
the
one
she
has
a
crush
on
me
there's
nothing
here
let's
go
it's
always
been
me
big
funny
xander
oh
what
she
just
suddenly
decides
i'm
not
the
cool
one
any
more
why
is
that
okay
but
what
they
didn't
get
was
that
it
was
a
copy
of
the
bill
of
lading
so
they
thought
that
it
was
another
order
form
so
now
i've
got
two
shipments
of
greek
amphorae
on
my
hands
that's
funny
and
really
how
many
do
you
need
amphorae
oh
buffy
spike
came
by
to
apologize
for
yesterday
our
missing
child
drama
and
he
just
decided
to
hang
out
for
a
while
oh
well
i
got
talking
about
the
gallery
see
there
was
this
oh
don't
get
us
all
laughing
again
joyce
anyhow

really
need
to
talk
to
your
eldest

got
a
bit
of
info

might
be
keen
on
knowin'
sorry

got
a
bead
on
the
guy
who

those
people
the
ones

the
train
do

eat
naughty
shh
you
needn't
make
up
stories
i
already
know
why
you're
not
coming
poor
boy
tin
soldiers
put
funny
little
knickknacks
in
your
brain
can't
hunt
can't
hurt
can't
kill
you've
got
a
chip
right
so
you've
heard
poor
spike's
become
a
cautionary
tale
for
vampires
right
'you
better
be
good
kiddies
or
else
they
might
wire
you
up
someday'
i
don't
believe
in
science
all
those
bits
and
molecules
no
one's
ever
seen
i
trust
eyes
and
heart
alone
and
do
you
know
what
mine
is
singing
out
right
now
you're
a
killer
born
to
slash
and
bash
and
oh
bleed
like
beautiful
poetry
no
little
tinkertoy
could
ever
stop
you
from
flowing
yeah
ohh
but
the
pain
love
you
don't
understand
it's
it's
searing
it's
um
blinding
all
in
your
head
i
can
see
it
little
bit
of
plastic
spiderwebbing
out
nasty
blue
shocks
and
every
one
is
a
lie
electricity
lies
spike
it
tells
you
you're
not
a
bad
dog
but
you
are
what
the
heck
is
this
oh
bloody
hell
who
is
oh
wait
i
get
it
our
little
sex
game
was
just
the
beginning
now
you've
gone
and
picked
up
some
cheap
queen
of
the
damned
to
dress
up
like
your
precious
droodzilla
harm
you'd
better
not
be
thinking
what
i
think
you're
thinking
'cause
my
answer
is
the
same
as
always
no
threesomes
unless
it's
boy
boy
girl
or
charlize
theron
harm
you
moron
this
is
drusilla
oh
well
you've
got
some
nerve
showing
up
here
like
this
after
all
this
time
after
breaking
my
sweet
booboo's
heart
do
you
have
any
idea
how
hard
it's
been
to
break
down
the
walls
he
put
up
after
you
left
i
mean
serious
trust
issues
harm
so
it's
no
use
you
crawling
back
to
him
'cause
spikey
don't
play
that
game
any
more
morticia
it's
been
fun
while
it
lasted
harm
but
i
think
it'd
be
best
now
if
you
hit
the
road
why
because
she's
back
no
because
i
am
and
there
you
are
my
darling
deadly
boy
well
he
he
actually
told
you
he
he
said
'i
love
you'
well
ii
didn't
let
him
get
that
far
but
i
could
see
the
words
coming
honey
did
you
somehow
unintentionally
lead
him
on
in
any
way
uh
send
him
signals
well
i
i
do
beat
him
up
a
lot
for
spike
that's
like
third
base
buffy
um
i'm
really
worried
so
am
i
he
could
become
dangerous
not
really
as
long
as
it's
still
chips
ahoy
in
spike's
head
he
can't
hurt
me
or
any
of
us
you
know
besides
this'll
probably
just
blow
over
you
know
it's
just
some
weird
spike
thing
he'll
have
the
hots
for
some
gak
demon
before
we
know
it
i
don't
know
uh
these
things
can
can
become
pretty
twisted
yeah
and
spike
i
mean
he's
pretty
twisted
yeah
well
well
you
made
it
clear
right
that
it
could
never
happen
that
there's
no
possible
way
ever
yeah
i
i
think
so
i
don't
know
i
i
was
just
so
thrown
well
buffy
you
have
to
talk
to
him
again
what
no
no
no
no
i
have
to
avoid
him
again
not
until
you
shut
him
down
completely
if
he
thinks
there's
even
a
little
chance
with
you
there's
no
telling
what
he'll
do
i
know
this
is
hard
honey
but
i
think
you
made
the
right
decision
better
to
nip
this
in
the
bud
before
the
bud
nips
me
exactly
if
you
want
buffy
i
can
go
with
back
you
up
with
some
scowling
thanks
but
i
think
this
is
something
i
have
to
do
myself
besides
you
know
maybe
i'm
wrong
maybe
this
this
whole
thing's
just
been
blown
way
out
of
proportion
and
he's
already
gone
back
to
wanting
me
dead
here's
hoping
you
know
what
though
there
is
one
thing
you
can
do
for
me
while
i'm
gone
spike
are
you
here
spike
see
anything
interesting
spike
i
uh
what

what
happened
me
you
remember
my
ex
don't
you
slayer

back
she
did
couldn't
live
without
me

boy's
been
feeding
again

eat

teensy
bit

when
you're
all
dour
and
straight
to
businesslike

well
through
playing
there
she
is
beginning
to
think
you'd
sleep
the
night
away
dru
drusilla
not
nice
to
change
the
game
in
midplay
spike
you've
taken
my
chair
and
the
music
hasn't
stopped
sorry

my
house
my
rules
i
think
i
shall
be
very
cross
with
you
when
i'm
free
again
what's
going
on
simple
i'm
gonna
prove
something
i
love
you
oh
my
god
no
look
at
me
i
love
you
you're
all
i
bloody
think
about
dream
about
you're
in
my
gut
my
throat
i'm
drowning
in
you
summers
i'm
drowning
in
you
i
can
do
without
the
laugh
track
dru
but
it's
so
funny
i
knew
before
you
did
i
knew
you
loved
the
slayer
the
pixies
in
my
head
whispered
it
to
me
you
can't
tell
me
that
there
isn't
anything
there
between
you
and
me
i
know
you
feel
something
it's
called
revulsion
and
whatever
you
think
you're
feeling
it's
not
love
you
can't
love
without
a
soul
oh
we
can
you
know
we
can
love
quite
well
if
not
wisely
you
still
don't
believe
still
don't
think
i
mean
it
you
want
proof
huh
how's
this
i'm
gonna
kill
drusilla
for
you
that
doesn't
prove
anything
except
that
you're
a
sick
miserable
vampire
that
i
should
have
dusted
a
long
time
ago
and
hey
already
there
don't
mock
this
go
mock
yourself
this
is
drusilla
girl
you
have
the
slightest
idea
what
she
means
to
me
it's
the
face
of
my
salvation
she
delivered
me
from
mediocrity
for
over
a
century
we
cut
a
swath
through
continents
a
hundred
years
she
never
stopped
surprising
me
never
stopped
taking
me
to
new
depths
i
was
a
lucky
bloke
just
to
touch
such
a
black
beauty
aw
ow
so
you
see
it
means
something
not
to
me
kill
her
why
do
i
care
here's
why
if
you
don't
admit
that
there's
something
there
some
tiny
feeling
for
me
then
i'll
untie
dru
let
her
kill
you
instead
yes
please
i
like
that
game
much
more
just
give
me
something
a
crumb
a
barest
smidgen
tell
me
maybe
someday
there's
a
chance
spike
the
only
chance
you
had
with
me
was
when
i
was
unconscious
oh
what
ohh
gaaah
what
the
bleeding
hell
is
wrong
with
you
bloody
women
what
the
hell
does
it
take
why
do
you
bitches
torture
me
which
question
do
you
want
me
to
answer
first
look
i
i'm
at
the
end
of
my
bleeding
tether
you
know
i
don't
even
know
why
i
even
bother
you
know
this
is
your
fault
you're
the
one
to
blame
for
all
this
am
i
bloody
right
you
are
if
you
hadn't
left
me
for
that
chaos
demon
i
never
would
have
come
back
here
never
would
have
had
this
sodding
chip
in
my
skull
and
you

wouldn't
be
able
to
touch
me
because
this
with
you
is
wrong
i
know
it
i'm
not
a
complete
idiot
you
think
i
like
having
you
in
here
destroying
everything
that
was
me
until
all
that's
left
is
you
in
a
dead
shell
you
say
you
hate
it
but
you
won't
leave
you
know
what
i
should
just
do
is
get
rid
of
both
of
you
burn
you
cut
you
into
little
pieces
so
there
won't
be
any
more
bints
to
cock
up
things
for
spi
oh
great
what
about
me
spike
you
forget
about
me
again
the
actual
girlfriend
i
gave
you
the
best
bunch
of
months
of
my
life
that's
right
little
girl
teach
our
naughty
boy
a
lesson
oh
so
now
you're
all
ganging
up
i
thought
i
could
change
you
spike
i
thought
maybe
if
i
gave
and
i
gave
and
gave
maybe
you'd
come
around
maybe
be
a
little
nicer
stop
treating
me
like
your
dog
but
now
i
see
it's
you
you're
the
dog
who
needs
to
be
put
d
ow
you're
on
my
hair
poor
spike
so
lost
even
i
can't
help
you
now
oh
spikey
and
you
can
say
goodbye
to
this
because
you're
not
gonna
see
it
any
more
ever
unless
you
run
into
me
somewhere
and
it's
me
walking
away
from
you
but
even
then
i'll
probably
just
you
know
back
away
buffy
come
on
now
stop
you
can't
just
walk
away
from
this
what
part
of
punching
you
in
the
face
do
you
not
understand
so
we
had
a
fight
it's
not
our
first
love
and
it
doesn't
change
anything
it
changes
everything
spike
i
want
you
out
i
want
you
out
of
this
town
i
want
you
off
this
planet
you
don't
come
near
me
my
friends
or
my
family
again
ever
understand
no
it's
not
that
easy
we
have
something
buffy
it's
not
pretty
but
it's
real
and
there's
nothing
either
one
of
us
can
do
about
it
like
it
or
not
i'm
in
your
life
you
can't
just
shut
me
out
joss
whedon
