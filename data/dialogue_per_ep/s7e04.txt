a
freakin'
child
lock
on
it

been
kinda
stressed
myself
well
the
whole
willow

under
my
feet
here
in
another
time
dimension
here
there's
willow
there's
the
looming
humongo
bad
and
it's
a
school
night
i
should
be
home
in
bed
cuddled
up
to
my
insomnia
and
worrying
about
how
i'm
gonna
mess
up
tomorrow
you'll
be
fine
you'll
be
a
great
counselor
it's
my
first
week
actually
talking
to
the
kids
what
if
their
problems
are
all
weird
and
tricky
i
think
you
underestimate
your
familiarity
with
the
world
of
weird
and
tricky
this
job's
perfect
for
you
check
out
perfect
me
taking
my
sister
on
an
educational
outing
to
the—
dead
body
i
don't
know
amateur
opinion
here
but
she
looks
dead
i
mean
like
natural
causes
dead
the
paper
said
she
had
unusual
cuts
and
contusions
on
her
neck
maybe
she
cut
herself
shaving
and
then
died
naturally
of
embarrassment
she
looks
peaceful
i
am
not
peaceful
that
i
can
help
with
i
always
thought
closed
caskets
were
more
tasteful
anyway
hello
come
in
hi
mr
miller
sent
me
here
do
you
know
why
i'm
not
sure
maybe
'cause
this
guy
was
picking
on
me
i
don't
wanna
talk
to
you
ok
that's
fine
i'm
serious
i
don't
wanna
talk
ok
cut
to
9
int
buffy's
cubicle
at
sunnydale
high
day
you
know
i
hate
to
miss
bio
but
i
thought
it
was
best
i
come
speak
with
you
so
what's
on
your
mind
on
my
mind
are
you
worried
about
school
uh
friends
girls
your
parents
yeah
yeah
that's
it
my
parents
what
about
them
oh
issues
of
divorce
you
know
it's
awful
being
teased
but
the
thing
is
you
know
with
bullies
like
this
they're
really
just—
insecure
yeah
everyone
says
that
you
know
i'm
really
tired
of
everyone
being
so
insecure
divorce
is
terrible
my
parents
got
divorced
when
i
was
a
kid
yeah
my
parents
are
happily
married
it's
hard
uh
i
feel
left
out
bbut
i'm
also
concerned
about
girls
ok
i'm
just
bored
maybe
i
should
get
back
to
bio
you
have
to
stick
up
for
yourself
amanda
you
need
to
show
this
bully
that
you're
not
gonna
take
any
more
of
his
sh—guff
uh
any
guff
'cause
that's
what
i
did
i
stuck
up
for
myself
the
other
day
after
class
i
jumped
him
in
the
parking
lot
and
i
slammed
his
stupidass
insecure
face
right
into
the
pavement
you
what
i
guess
that's
another
reason
mr
miller
wanted
me
to
see
you
do
you
think
i
should
pound
on
him
some
more
i
bet
she's
giving
them
great
advice
absolutely
those
kids
are
lucky
to
have
buffy
looking
out
for
them
i
just
wish
she
believed
it
she's
still
stressing
over
the
whole
dropped
out
of
college
not
actually
qualified
thing
plus
the
salivating
hellmouth
underneath
her
feet
and
the
whole—
from
beneath
you
it
devours
it's
not
the
friendliest
jingle
is
it
it's
no
i
like
ike
or
milk
it
does
a
body
good
i
know
it's
gonna
be
bad
it's
gonna
be
real
bad
and
i
wonder
will
i—
well
if
it
comes—
when
it
comes
will
i
be
able
to
help
i
think
so
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
what
i
can
do
i
mean
frankly
i'm—i'm
scared
of
what
i
might
do
yeah
i
get
that
figuring
out
how
to
control
your
magic
seems
a
lot
like
hammering
a
nail
well
uh
hear
me
out
so
you're
hammering
right
ok
well
at
the
end
of
the
hammer
you
have
the
power
but
no
control
it
takes
like
two
strokes
to
hit
the
nail
in
or
you
could
hit
your
thumb
ouch
so
you
choke
up
control
but
no
power
it
could
take
like
ten
strokes
to
knock
the
nail
in
power
control
it's
a
tradeoff
that's
actually
not
a
bad
analogy
thanks
except
i'm
less
worried
about
hitting
my
thumb
and
more
worried
about
going
all
blackeyed
baddy
and
bewitching
that
hammer
into
cracking
my
friends'
skulls
open
like
coconuts
right
ouch
sorry
xander
being
back
here
i
don't
know
it'll
take
time
are
you
sure
you're
ready
for
this
hey
it's
me
i'm
scared
i
don't
want
to
be
left
all
alone
my
brother's
joining
up
with
the
marines
whew
you
know
if
he
knew
i
was
making
a
fool
of
myself
he'd
smack
me
in
my
head
i
guess
i'm
just
being
stupid
sounds
like
your
brother's
pretty
tough
yeah
he's
a
man
i'm
just
all
messed
up
right
now
you
are
not
messed
up
it
is
not
messed
up
to
worry
about
your
brother
what
if
he
doesn't
come
back
what
if
he
gets
blown
up
have
you
talked
to
him
have
you
told
him
how
you
feel
no
no
i
don't
wanna
talk
to
him
i
don't
wanna
do
that
i
don't
wanna
talk
to
him
ok
tough
boy
you
understand
so
josh
what's
on
your
mind
well
i'm
worried
that
i'm
gay
ok
first
of
all
i
i
think
it's
great
that
you
would
come
and
talk
to
me
about
this
and
second
of
all
you
should
know
that
there
is
nothing
shameful
about
being
gay
nothing
ii
know
it's
just—i'm
not
positive
so
uh
i
was
thinking
that
why
don't
you
go
on
uh
a
date
with
me
so
i
can
be
sure
it
sounds
like
it's
difficult
for
you
like
maybe
your
sister
makes
it
hard
for
you
to
establish
your
own
identity
you
said
she's
controlling
she
doesn't
let
you
make
your
own
decisions—
yeah
and
she
borrows
my
clothes
without
asking
i
understand
that
must
be
hard
so
you're
not
doing
your
homework
i
guess
not
it
all
just
seems
kind
of
whatever
i
know
high
school
can
seem
kind
of
frustrating
but
if
you
just
get
through
it
then
you
can
go
to
college
you
know
or
you
can
join
the
french
foreign
legion
or
anything
you
want
yeah
well
i'm
not
gonna
do
all
that
stuff
ok
no
foreign
legion
i
get
that
i
mean
all
the
changing
your
name
and
being
indentured
for
all
those
years
and
occupying
algeria
it's
just
that
i'm
not
graduating

what
am
i
supposed
to
do
well
you
did
what
you
were
supposed
to
do
you
reported
the
situation
to
me
and
listen
buffy
it's
hard
kids
this
age
they're
hurting
they're
pissed
off
and
they
say
things
sometimes
they
say
awful
things
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
had
a
thing
with
this
guy
right
real
bully
i
kept
telling
everyone
that
he'd
better
sleep
with
one
eye
open
'cause
i
was
gonna
bust
his
ass
well
i
got
suspended
talk
like
that
is
taken
pretty
seriously
where
i
come
from
the
hood
beverly
hills
which
is
a
hood
listen
the
point
is
i
was
talking
big
because
i
was
scared
i
couldn't
bust
a
move
back
in
high
school
let
alone
someone's
ass
most
of
the
time
that's
what
it
is
when
these
students
act
out
fear
pain—
but
sometimes
it's
not
just
talk
right
every
time
there's
a
threat
like
this
we
do
the
same
dance
inform
teachers
search
lockers
but
we
can't—we
can't
know
what's
gonna
happen
and
we
can't
search
their
brains
we
just—we
just
do
what
we
can
it's
not
enough
i
need
to
fix
this
i
don't
usually
get
a
heads
up
before
somebody
dies
what
do
you
mean
usually
no
no
not
since—i
mean
i'm
sure
it's
not
usual
to
get
a
chance
to
stop
something
like—i
just
i
need
to
do
something
ok
i
have
to
make
this
better—
oh
oh
shoot
i
have
a
job
for
you
what're
you
drawing
don't
you
have
a
history
test
to
study
for
when
are
you
gonna
design
me
a
tattoo
a
tattoo
oh
right
i
could
imagine
that
come
on
design
something
i
mean
maybe
we
could
get
matching
tattoos
how
'bout
like
a
snake
with
fire
coming
out
of
its
mouth
hmm
or
a
sexy
hula
girl
who
wiggles
when
you
flex
yeah
now
you're
talking
sexy
hula
girl
but
a
sexy
snake
hula
girl
you
are
so
ridiculous
so
i
was
thinking
maybe
we
should
go
to
that
dance
after
all
what
do
you
mean
after
all
i
told
you
i
don't
wanna
go
well
i
assumed
you
were
kidding
it
would
probably
be
lame
anyways
well
yeah
but
lame
is
funny…
and
you
know
maybe
fun
if
you
know
we're
hanging
out
together
we
hang
out
together
all
the
time
right
and
therefore
we
should
hang
out
together
at
the
winter
formal
hey
um
i'm
in
ceramics
class
with
you
i'm
dawn
summers
i
forgot
if
we
had
an
assignment
last
week
i
spaced
right
um
hey
dawn
uh
yeah
you
know
we
did
have
an
assignment
but
i
didn't
write
it
down
i
think
something
to
do
with
glazes
as
scintillating
as
the
pottery
talk
is
i'd
better
actually
go
study
to
dawn
i'm
mike
by
the
way
hi
mike
ii'm
sorry
i
didn't
mean
to—
oh
don't
worry
about
it
i
better
go
hit
the
books
if
i'm
gonna
ace
this
test
nice
meeting
you
though
cass
i'll
see
you
later
yep
hey
mike
you're
gonna
get
a
b
oh
a+
baby
a+
so
um
is
that
any
good
yeah
actually
yeah
what
do
you
have
to
read
it
for
oh
just
for
me
i
guess
i
kinda
stopped
reading
my
homework
assignments
i
just
read
what
i
want
that's
so
cool
i'd
do
that
but
my
sister'd
be
down
my
neck
in
a
second
summers
hey—
are
you
the
counselor's
little
sister
no
she's
my
sister
lucky
me
huh
no
no
she'sshe's
really
nice
i
actually
just
saw
her
this
morning
oh
really
what
about
uh
i'm
sorry
that's
none
of
my
business
no
i
don't
care
so
mike's
a
cutie
are
you
guys
going
to
that
dance
no
i
don't
think
so
oh
i
mean
didn't
he
ask
you
uh
like
105
times
and
you
said
no
106
times
no
ii
can't
go
i'm
not
gonna
be
around
that
night
cassie's
records
all
show
the
same
thing
good
grades
good
kid
then
all
of
a
sudden
not
so
good
grades
absenteeism
comments
about
apathy
and
depression—
so
the
question
is
what
changed
right
if
she
did
have
some
sort
of
psychic
vision
that
would
explain
it
do
you
really
think
this
girl
is
some
kind
of
precog
oh
i
don't
know
i
told
you
about
the
shirt
right
buff
you
spilled
a
cup
of
coffee
i'm
not
saying
you
don't
have
slayer
grace
but
it's
not
the
first
time
i
mean
maybe
just
maybe
you're
trying
so
hard
to
help
that
you're
seeing
paranormal
when
there's
just
normal
maybe
but
maybe
not
want
me
to
check
her
medical
records
her
doctor
already
sent
them
let
me
see
that
strep
throat
ear
infections
yeast
infections
none
of
my
business
no
real
info

have
you
googled

search
engine

see
what
cassie
newton
pulls
up
hey
look
check
this
she's
got
her
own
site
a
day
and
a
half
of
researching
and
we
finally
try
looking
up
her
wow
that's
a
lot
of
poems
poems
always
a
sign
of
pretentious
inner
turmoil
ok
death
is
really
on
her
brain
we
all
deal
with
death
this
girl
isn't
just
dealing
she's
giving
death
a
long
sloppy
wordkiss
she
has
a
yen
for
the
big
dirtnap
i
don't
know
i
mean
a
lot
of
teens
post
some
pretty
angsty
poetry
on
the
web
i
mean
i
even
posted
a
melodramatic
love
poem
or
two
back
in
the
day
love
poems
i'm
over
you
now
sweetie
love
poems
look
all
i'm
saying
is
that
this
is
normal
teen
stuff
you
join
chat
rooms
you
write
poetry
you
post
doogie
howser
fanfic
it's
all
normal
right
let's
see
what
other
sites
there
are
you

way
off
track

got
a
hunch
on
this
one

that's
her
dad

guy
that
asked
