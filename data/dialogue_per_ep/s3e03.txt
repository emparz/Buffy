the
terms
of
your
reentry
missy

'em
one
that
you
pass
a
makeup
test
of
every
class
you
skipped
out
on
last
year
two
that
you
provide
in
writing
one
glowing
letter
of
recommendation
from
any
member
of
our
faculty
who
is
not
an
english
librarian
three
that
you
complete
an
interview
with
our
school
psychologist
who
must
conclude
that
your
violent
tendencies
are
under
control
i'm
not
sure
i
like
your
attitude
mr
snyder
i
spoke
with
the
school
board
and
according
to
them
i'm
required
to
educate
every
juvenile
who
is
not
in
jail
where
she
belongs
welcome
back
so
let
me
get
this
straight
i'm
really
back
in
school
because
the
school
board
overruled
you
wow
that's
like
having
your
whole
ability
to
do
this
job
called
into
question
when
you
think
about
it
i
think
what
my
daughter's
trying
to
say
is
nyah
nyahnyahnyah
nyah
it's
the
mayor
on
line
one
it's
so
great
that
you're
a
schoolgirl
again
giles
say
what
he
wanted
do
you
think
he's
mad
no
i
don't
think
so
i
think
he
just
needed
to
see
you
have
you
ever
noticed
though
when
he
is
hi
giles
oh
hi
been
there
long
buffy
good
timing
i
could
use
your
help
i
trust
you
remember
the
demon
acathla
giles
contain
yourself
yes
i'm
back
in
school
but
you
know
how
it
embarrasses
me
when
you
gush
so
let's
just
skip
all
that
and
get
straight
to
work
oh
ahhhh
well
i
um
wellw
o
oof
course
it's
wonderful
to
have
you
back
iiit
goes
without
saying
but
you
enjoy
making
me
say
it
don't
you
okay
acathla
huh
what
are
you
doing
making
him
some
demon
pizza
we
need
to
make
sure
that
he
remains
dormant
and
that
the
dimensional
vortex
is
sealed
tight
so
i'm
working
on
a
binding
spell
oh
a
spell
can
i
help
possibly
with
the
research
it's
very
sensitive
and
oh
who's
more
sensitive
than
me
and
difficult
spell
it
involves
creating
a
aa
protective
circle
around
well
i
don't
want
to
bore
you
with
the
details
but
uh
well
there's
a
litany
ththat
one
has
to
recite
in
aramaic
and
it's
very
specific
so
i
need
to
get
a
few
details
about
your
experience
of
defeating
acathla
and
angel
fire
away
i've
put
the
time
at
about
um
617
around
about
half
an
hour
after
xander
rescued
me
less
more
like
ten
minutes
oh
was
the
vortex
already
open
barely
i
see
and
angel
a
big
fight
angel
got
the
pointy
end
of
the
sword
acathla
sucked
him
into
hell
instead
of
the
world
that's
about
the
it
yes
well
that
um
should
be
very
helpful
oh
no
i
have
to
go
take
an
english
makeup
exam
they
give
you
credit
just
for
speaking
it
right
oh
mm
sage
i
love
that
smell
and
marnox
root
you
know
a
smidge
of
this
mixed
with
a
virgin's
saliva
does
something
i
know
nothing
about
these
forces
are
not
something
that
one
plays
around
with
willow
what
have
you
been
conjuring
nothing
much
well
you
know
i
tried
this
spell
to
cure
angel
and
i
guess
that
was
a
bust
but
since
then
you
know
small
stuff
floating
feather
fire
out
of
ice
which
next
time
i
won't
do
on
the
bedspread

be
making
a
strange
clucking
sound

my
tongue

given
you
every
part
of
me
tried
everything
i
could
to
make
you
see
another
couple
leaves
the
dance
floor
and
the
camera
follows
them
until
they
pass
by
an
alcove
furnished
like
a
turnofthecentury
parlor
with
a
love
seat
a
couple
of
armchairs
tables
and
a
lamp
with
a
pink
shade

scott
walks
off
to
find
a
place
to
wait
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
and
flops
her
head
back
mentally
kicking
herself
for
the
way
she
handled
that
come
on
buffy
i
mean
the

is
charm
aand
normal
which
is
what
you

love
me

the
couple
continues
to
dance
getting
close
and
touching
each
other
at
one
point
then
separating
again
you
said
i
was
the
best
thing
in
your
life
buffy
begins
to
really
wonder
about
them
the
couple
gets
close
again
and
the
girl
extends
her
arm
pointing
at
the
door
the
guy
takes
the
hint
and
leads
her
out
with
his
arm
around
her
buffy
watches
them
go
suspicious
of
his
intentions
she
sees
him
say
bye
to
his
buddy
and
head
for
the
door
i
don't
think
that
guy
thrives
on
sunshine

probably
just
making
out

that's
not
what
making

like
unless
i'm
doing
it
wrong

struggling
this
won't

it's
okay
i
got
it
you're
uh
buffy
right
i'm
faith
i'm
gonna
go
out
on
a
limb
and
say
there's
a
new
slayer
in
town
can
i
borrow
that
thanks
b
couldn't
have
done
it
without
you
the
whole
summer
it
was
like
the
worst
heat
wave
so
it's
about
a
hundred
and
eighteen
degrees
and
i'm
sleeping
without
a
stitch
on
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
hear
this
screaming
from
outside
so
i
go
tearing
out
stark
nude
and
this
church
bus
has
broke
down
and
there's
these
three
vamps
feasting
on
half
the
baptists
in
south
boston
so
i
waste
the
vamps
and
the
preacher
comes
up
and
he's
hugging
me
like
there's
no
tomorrow
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
cops
pull
up
and
they
arrested
us
both
wow
they
should
film
that
story
and
show
it
every
christmas
god
i
could
eat
a
horse
isn't
it
crazy
how
slayin'
just
always
makes
you
hungry
and
horny
well
sometimes
ii
crave
a
nonfat
yogurt
afterwards
i
get
it
not
the
horny
thing
yuck
but
the
two
slayer
thing
there
was
one
and
then
buffy
died
for
like
two
minutes
so
then
kendra
was
called
and
then
when
she
died
faith
was
called
but
why
were
you
called
here
well
i
wasn't
my
watcher
went
off
to
some
retreat
thing
in
england
and
so
i
skipped
out
i
figured
this
was
my
chance
to
meet
the
infamous
buff
and
compare
notes
so
b
did
you
really
use
a
rocket
launcher
one
time
uh
yeah
actually
it's
a
funny
story
there
was
so
what
was
the
uh
story
about
that
alligator
oh
there's
this
big
daddy
vampire
out
of
missouri
who
used
to
keep
them
as
pets
so
he's
got
me
rasslin'
one
of
'em
okay
the
thing
must
have
been
twelve
feet
long
and
i'm
so
was
this
um
ahem
also
naked
well
the
alligator
was
xander
find
a
new
theme
i
tell
ya
i
never
had
more
trouble
than
that
damn
vamp
so
what
about
you
what
was
your
toughest
kill
um
well
you
know
they're
all
difficult
i
guess
uh
oh
oh
do
you
guys
remember
the
three
that's
right
you
never
met
the
three
well
there
was
three
something
occurring
uh
now
you
both
kill
vamps
and
who
could
blame
you
but
i'm
i'm
wondering
about
your
position
on
werewolves
oz
is
a
werewolf
it's
a
long
story
i
got
bit
apparently
not
that
long

long

don't
go
scratchin'
at
me
or
humpin'
my
leg
we're
fivebyfive
you
know
fair
enough
the
vamps

they
better
get
their
asses
to
defcon
one
'cause
you

i
are
gonna
have
fun

very
sserene
there's
horse
riding
and
hiking
and
punting

maybe
i
should
introduce
you

a
muddy
grave

anything
in
high
school
nowadays

i've
learned
to
be
afraid

are
a
hoot
and
a
half
if
i'd
had
friends
like
you

high
school

dropped
out

might've
been
sad
about
it

alligator

throat

sarcasm

in
a
t3
um
twentyfive
hundred
megs
per
we

the
whole

and
the
cotton

a
fifteenyearold
filipina

on
the
'net
and
she's
here
the
next
day
express
air
i
want
the
blood
of
the
slayer
on
that
note
there's
good
news
and
bad
rumor
has
it
that
this
town
already
has
a
slayer
which
makes
two
i'm
not
real
sure
how
that
happened
i
don't
care
if
there're
a
hundred
slayers
i'll
kill
them
all
she's
going
to
pay
for
what
she
did
to
me
yeah
she
is
i'm
running
a
computer
check
on
every
hotel
rooming
house
and
youth
hostel
in
town
meanwhile
as
soon
as
the
sun
goes
down
we're
out
in
force
you
guys
order
a
piz
so
you're
a
slayer
too
isn't
that
interesting
do
you
like
it
god
i
love
it
uh
mom
uh
just
a
second
honey
you
know
buffy
never
talks
that
way
why
do
you
love
it
well
when
i'm
fighting
it's
like
the
whole
world
goes
away
and
i
only
know
one
thing
that
i'm
gonna
win
and
they're
gonna
lose
i
like
that
feelin'
well
sure
beats
that
dead
feeling
you
get
when
they
win
and
you
lose
i
don't
let
that
kind
of
negative
thinking
in
right
right
that
could
get
you
hurt
buffy
can
be
awfully
negative
sometimes
see
honey
you
gotta
fight
that
i'm
working
on
it
oh
faith
can
i
get
you
another
soft
drink
oh
you
bet
right
she's
really
cool
huh
best
mom
ever
excuse
me
i
like
this
girl
buffy
she's
very
personable
she
gets
along
with
my
friends
my
watcher
my
mom
now
buffy
plus
at
school
today
she
was
making
eyes
at
my
notboyfriend
does
anybody
else
think
faith
is
creepy
no
but
i'm
the
one
getting
singlewhitefemaled
here
it's
probably
good
you
were
an
only
child
mom
i'm
just
getting
my
life
back
i'm
not
looking
to
go
halfsies
on
it
well
there
are
some
things
i'd
be
happy
to
see
you
share
like
the
slaying
i
mean
two
of
you
fighting
is
safer
than
one
right
i
guess
unless
i
mean
you
heard
her
she
loves
the
slaying
couldn't
she
take
over
for
you
mom
no
one
can
take
over
for
me
but
you're
going
to
college
next
year
i
think
it
would
be
mom
the
only
way
you
get
a
new
slayer
is
when
the
old
slayer
dies
then
that
means
you
when
did
you
die
you
never
told
me
you
died
no
iit
was
just
for
a
few
minutes
oh
i
hate
this
i
hate
your
life
mom
i
look
ii
know
you
didn't
choose
this
i
know
it
chose
you
i
have
tried
to
march
in
the
'slayer
pride'
parade
but
i
don't
want
you
to
die
oh
i'm
not
gonna
die
i
know
how
to
do
my
job
besides
like
you
said
i've
got
help
now
i've
got
all
the
help
i
can
stand
didn't
we
um
do
this
street
already
funny
thing
about
vamps
they'll
hit
a
street
even
after
mm
you've
been
doing
this
the
longest
i
have
yeah
maybe
a
little
too
long
excuse
me
what's
that
supposed
to
mean
nothing
you
got
a
problem
i'm
fivebyfive
b
living
entirely
large
actually
wondering
about
your
problem
well
i
may
not
sleep
in
the
nude
and
rassle
alligators
maybe
it's
time
you
started
'cause
obviously
something
in
your
bottle
needs
uncorking
what
is
it
the
the
angel
thing
what
do
you
know
about
angel
just
what
your
friends
tell
me
big
love
big
loss
you
oughta
deal
and
move
on
but
you're
not
i
got
an
idea
how
about
from
now
on
we
don't
hear
from
you
on
angel
or
anything
else
in
my
life
which
by
the
way
is
my
life
what
are
you
getting
so
strung
out
for
b
why
are
your
lips
still
moving
f
did
i
just
hear
a
threat
would
you
like
to
wow
think
you
can
take
me
yeah
i
just
hope
they
can't
my
dead
mother
hits
harder
than
that
faith
stake
him
already
and
give
me
a
hand
this
is
me
you
un
dead
bastard
for
kakistos
we
live
for
kakistos
you'll
die
faith
oh
faith
you
can't
touch
me
what
is
wrong
with
you
what
are
you
talking
about
i'm
talking
about
you
'living
large'
on
that
vampire
gee
if
doing
violence
to
vampires
upsets
you
i
think
you're
in
the
wrong
line
of
work
yeah
or
maybe
you
like
it
a
little
too
much
i
was
getting
the
job
done
the
job
is
to
slay
demons
not
beat
them
to
a
bloody
pulp
while
their
friends
corner
me
i
thought
you
could
handle
yourself
what
you
must
realize
buffy
is
that
you
and
faith
have
very
different
temperaments
yeah
and
mine's
the
sane
one
the
girl's
not
playing
with
a
full
deck
giles
she
has
almost
no
deck
she
has
a
three
you
said
yourself
that
sheshe
killed
one
shsheshe's
just
a
plucky
fighter
who
got
a
little
carried
away
which
is
natural
she's
focused
on
the
slaying
she
doesn't
have
a
whole
other
life
here
as
you
do
she
doesn't
need
a
life
she
has
mine
i
think
you're
being
a
little
no
i'm
being
a
lot
i
know
that
but
she
nearly
got
us
both
killed
the
girl
needs
help
all
right
i'll
see
if
i
can
reach
her
watcher
at
the
retreat
they're
eight
hours
ahead
now
i
guess
they're
probably
sitting
down
to
a
nightcap
i
wonder
if
they
still
kayak
i
used
to
love
a
good
kayak
you
see
tthey
don't
even
consider
sorry
i
digress
the
um
vampires
that
attacked
you
can
you
furnish
me
with
some
details
that
might
help
me
trace
their
lineage
i
mean
ancient
ororor
modern
dress
amulets
cultish
tattoos
uh
no
tats
crappy
dressers
and
uh
oh
the
one
that
nearly
bit
me
mentioned
something
about
kissing
toast
he
lived
for
kissing
toast
you
mean
'kakistos'
maybe
it
was
taquitos
maybe
he
lived
for
taquitos
what
kakistos
is
that
bad
'kakistos'
is
greek
it
means
the
worst
of
the
worst
it's
also
the
name
of
a
vampire
so
old
that
his
hands
and
feet
are
cloven
now
this
guy
shows
up
two
days
ago
right
right
around
the
same
time
my
bestest
new
little
sister
makes
the
scene
you
think
he
and
faith
are
connected
giles
there
are
two
things
that
i
don't
believe
in
coincidence
and
leprechauns
well
buffy
it's
entirely
possible
that
they
both
arrived
here
by
chance
simultaneously
okay
but
i
was
right
about
the
leprechauns
right
as
far
as
i
know
yes
good
okay
you
get
england
on
the
phone
i'm
gonna
talk
to
faith
see
if
'khaki
trousers'
rings
kakistos
kakistos
rings
a
bell
or
an
alarm
right
right
hi
scott
how
are
you
uh
ookay
you
know
ii
gotta
i
know
be
somewhere
else
right
think
of
this
as
my
lastditch
effort
i
realize
that
one
more
is
gonna
qualify
as
stalking
i've
given
it
a
lot
of
thoughtsome
might
say
too
much
thoughtto
to
how
i
might
be
a
part
of
your
life
it
begins
with
conversation
we
all
know
this
maybe
over
a
cup
of
coffee
or
maybe
at
the
buster
keaton
festival
playing
on
state
street
all
this
weekend
you
know
come
to
think
of
it
ii
don't
think
i've
given
a
fair
chance
to
buster
keaton
i
i
like
what
i've
seen
of
him
so
far
i
i
think
it
might
be
time
to
see
a
little
more
keaton
is
key
oh
um
i
got
you
a
little
present
the
guy
in
the
retro
shop
said
that
it
represents
friendship
and
that's
something
i
would
very
much
like
to
have
with
you
you
like
i
can't
iiii
can't
do
this
okay
i
get
the
message

know
i'll
get
it
to
you
by
tomorrow
i
swear
it's
not
like
i

i
bet

will
someday
not
if
i
listen
to
broads
like
you
roommates
are
extra
i'm
just
visiting
so
what
brings
you
to
the
poor
side
of
town
cloven
guy

by
the
name
kakistos
what
do
you
know
about
kakistos
that
he's
here
we're
not
happy
to
see
old
friends
are
we
what'd
he
do
to
you
it's
what
i
did
to
him
all
right
and
what
was
that
faith
you
came
here
for
a
reason
i
can
help
you
can
mind
your
own
business
i'm
the
one
that

yeah
you're
a
real
badass
when
it
comes
to
packing
what
was
that
you
said
about
my
problem
gotta
deal
and
move
on
well
we
have
the
'moving
on'
part
right
here
what
about
dealing
is
that
just
something
you're
gonna
dump
on
me
you
don't
know
me
you
don't
know
what
i've
been
through
i'll
take
care
of
this
all
right
like
you
took
care
of
your
watcher
he
killed
her
didn't
he
they
don't
have
a
word
for
what
he
did
to
her
oh
what
now
faith
you
run
he
runs
after
you
that's
where
the
head
start
comes
in
handy
faith
no
i
just
bought
us
a
little
more
time
no
nooooo
scream
later
escape
now
let's
go
we're
okay
what
happened
faith
what
happened
i
i
was
there
when
he
killed
my
watcher
and
i
saw
what
he
did
to
her
what
he
was
gonna
do
to
me
i
tried
to
stop
him
but
i
i
couldn't
and
i
ran
faith
first
rule
of
slaying
don't
die
you
did
the
right
thing
okay
you
didn't
die
now
you
do
the
math
one
of
him
two
of
us
no
yes
no
this
is
his
place
he
drove
us
here
faith
don't
die
no
if
we
don't
do
something
the
master
could
get
killed
well
our
prayers
are
with
him
there's
a
reason
these
vengeance
crusades
are
out
of
style
it's
the
modern
vampire
who
sees
the
big
picture
i
guess
you
need
a
bigger
stake
slayer
you
hungry
starved
the
council
has
approved
our
request
faith
is
to
stay
here
indefinitely
i'm
to
look
after
you
both
until
a
new
watcher
is
assigned
good
she
really
came
through
in
the
end
she
had
a
lot
to
deal
with
but
she
did
it
she
got
it
behind
her
i'm
glad
to
hear
it
angel
was
cured
i'm
sorry
when
i
killed
him
angel
was
cured
your
spell
worked
at
the
last
minute
will
i
was
about
to
take
him
out
and
um
something
went
through
him
and
he
was
angel
again
hehe
didn't
remember
anything
that
he'd
done
he
just
held
me
um
but
iit
was
it
was
too
late
and
i
i
had
to
so
i
i
told
him
that
i
loved
him
and
i
kissed
him
and
i
killed
him
i
don't
know
if
that
helps
with
your
spell
or
not
giles
uh
yes
i
i
believe
it
will
i'm
sorry
it's
okay
i've
been
holding
on
to
that
for
so
long
felt
good
to
get
it
out

see
you
guys
later
giles
i
know
you
don't
like
me
playing
with
mystical
forces

can
really
help
with
this
binding
spell
there
is
no
spell

while

earthly
way
you
could
possibly
know
that
about
me

knew
i
was
gonna
go
on
this
long
i
probably
would've
brought

trying
to
say

you
would
still
like

go
to
the
film

pretty
much
love
