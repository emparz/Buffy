survey
study
of
twentieth
century
novelists
open
to
freshmen
you
might
like
that
'introduction
to
the
modern
novel'
i'm
guessing

probably
have
to
read
the
modern
novel
maybe
more
than
one
i
like
books
i
just
don't
want
to
take
on
too
much
do
they
have
an
introduction
to
the
modern
blurb
oh
short
story
well
that's
good
oh
no
it
conflicts
with
psych
maybe
i
shouldn't
take
psych
you
gotta
iit's
fun
aand
you
can
use
it
as
your
science
requirement
anyway

painful
'nowning'
process

figure
out
how

collective
intelligence

this
force

penetrating
force

my
mind
opening

of

a
lot
of
fun

quite
a
character
you've
taken
it
i'm
a
ta
i'll
be
helping
the
professor
out
i'm
sorry
i've
forgotten
my
manners
in
all
the
concussion
i'm
riley
willow
and
this
is
my
friend
buffy
it's
nice
to
meet
you
both
i'm
nice
to
meet
hey
do
you
know
if
we're
going
to
be
studying
'operant
conditioning'
in
the
first
semester
'cause
i
hear
that's
kinda
professor
walsh's
specialty
absolutely
do
you
know
her
treatise
on
dietrichs
work
i
know
of
it
it's
not
in
the
syllabus
but
it's
a
fascinating
read
if
you're
in
to
that
sort
of
thing
they
have
it
here
oh
where
i'll
show
you
i
don't
meet
that
many
freshmen
that
know
that
much
about
psychology
well
it's
fascinating
yeah
you
know
'cause
everyone's
got
a
brain
or
almost
everyone
hi
oh
hi
are
you
buffy
yeah
kathy
hi
it's
nice
to
meet
you
yeah
so
it's
ah
it's
a
pretty
nice
room
hmm
i
was
surprised
'cause
you
hear
horror
stories
about
freshmen
housing
you
took
the
right
side
yeah
umm
but
if
you
want
it
no
no
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
that's
what
you
wanted
exited
for
classes
tomorrow
painfully
i
bet
there's
going
to
be
a
lot
of
parties
to
go
to
this
week
too
not
that
i'm
a
crazy
partier
oh
and
i'm
not
always
this
hyper
either
i'm
just
excited
yeah
me
too
i
am
really
glad
they
put
me
with
somebody
cool
i
can
tell
that
you're
cool
i
just
know
that
this
whole
year
is
going
to
be
super
fun
the
point
of
this
course
is
not
to
critique
popular
american
culture
it
is
not
to
pick
at
it
or
look
down
upon
it
and
it
is
not
to
watch
videos
for
credit
the
point
is
to
examine
do
you
know
if
this
class
is
full
yet
and
there
are
two
people
talking
at
once
and
i
know
that
one
of
them
is
me
and
the
other
is
a
blonde
girl
you
blonde
girl
stand
up
i'm
very
excited
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
that's
worth
interrupting
my
lecture
for
i
was
just
asking
if
the
class
was
still
open
if
i
could
still
sign
up
if
your
name
isn't
on
this
sheet
then
you
are
wasting
everyone's
time
are
you
on
the
sheet
they
told
me
that
if
i
just
do
you
understand
you
are
sucking
energy
from
everyone
in
this
room
they
came
here
to
learn
get
out
i
didn't
mean
to
suck
leave
thank
you
if
uh
you're
looking
for
psych
it's
through
here
oh
thanks
how's
your
head
sorry
yesterday
in
the
bookstore
you
don't
remember
oh
no
sure
i
remember
you
you're
willow's
friend
yeah
my
head
is
fine
it
just
stung
for
a
bit
and
i
lost
most
of
my
basic
motor
functions
it's
no
biggie
we're
here
i'm
sorry
i'm
trying
to
remember
you
buffy
buffy
right
have
fun
tonight
ok
thanks
you
know
i
was
just
wondering
professor
walsh
isn't
planning
on
yelling
at
me
and
kicking
me
out
of
the
class
is
she
it's
not
in
her
lesson
plan
great
how
was
pop
culture
i
decided
not
to
take
it
it
seemed
dull
ok
this
is
psych
105
'introduction
to
psychology'
i'm
professor
walsh
those
of
you
who
fall
under
my
good
graces
will
come
to
know
me
as
maggie
those
of
you
who
don't
will
come
to
know
me
by
the
name
my
tas
use
and
think
i
don't
know
about
'the
evil
bitch
monster
of
death'
make
no
mistake
i
run
a
hard
class
i
assign
a
lot
of
work
i
talk
fast
and
i
expect
you
to
keep
up
if
you're
looking
to
coast
i
recommend
'geology
101'
that's
where
the
football
players
are
ooh
wow
sorry
no
ii
wasn't
looking
did
you
uh
lose
your
way
me
oh
no
no
i'm
just
going
to
fischer
hall
which
i
know
is
on
the
earth
planet
recently
voted
'most
pathetic'
uhhuh
hmm
well
i'm
lost
and
i
have
a
map
so
ooh
i
come
in
second
i'm
buffy
by
the
way
eddie
ok
so
that's
fischer
hall
right
ok
and
this
is
dunwirth
building
that's
my
dorm
it's
just
it's
us
i
can't
find
are
we
the
blue
part
no
yes
ok
right
so
ii
came
from
there
then
we
just
wanna
go
that
way
to
the
bike
path
you
sound
very
certain
i'm
in
you're
taking
'psych
105'
with
professor
walsh
yeah
i
mean
i'm
gonna
try
she's
not
afraid
of
the
long
words
huh
yeah
she's
pretty
intense
a
lot
of
the
courses
are
really
tough
i'm
a
little
upset
i
had
it
on
good
authority
that
this
was
a
party
school
i
think
it's
supposed
to
get
easier
i
still
feel
like
carrying
around
a
security
blanket
'of
human
bondage'
have
you
ever
read
it
oh
i'm
not
really
into
porn
i
mean
i'm
just
i'm
trying
to
cut
way
back
no
there's
no
actual
bondage
it's
just
a
novel
i've
read
it
like
ten
times
i
always
keep
it
by
my
bed
security
blanket
i
don't
really
have
a
security
blanket
unless
you
count
mr
pointy
mr
pointy
oh
bike
path
so
it's
nice
to
know
that
i'm
not
the
only
entirely
confused
person
on
this
campus
i
suspect
there's
a
lot
of
us
well
i'll
look
for
you
in
psych
yeah
maybe
we
can
help
each
other
figure
out
what
the
hell
they're
talking
about
ok
maybe
even
make
it
through
the
year
goodnight
night
i'm
sorry
did
you
lose
your
way
you
looking
for
someone
yeah
you
made
a
friend
good
for
you
thanks
mom
yeah
eddie
just
took
off
packed
his
stuff
left
a
note
happens
sometimes
people
just
can't
handle
it
there's
always
a
few
kids
who
lose
it
early
in
the
first
semester
and
just
bail
weak
ones
i
guess
boring
boring
boring
boring
boring
boring
astonishingly
boring
we
we
have
to
kill
some
cooler
people
will
somebody
remind
me
you
were
the
one
who
said
pick
on
the
weak
ones
thin
the
herd
and
all
that
does
this
sweater
make
me
look
fat
no
the
fact
that
you're
fat
makes
you
look
fat
that
sweater
just
makes
you
look
purple
you're
such
a
loser
hey
words
can
hurt
like
a
fist
hey
check
it
out
well
do
we
have
a
klimt
yes
big
score
for
klimt
monet
still
well
in
the
lead
but
look
out
for
team
klimt
coming
from
behind
freshmen
man
they're
so
predictable
and
you
can
never
eat
just
one
yeah
i'm
hungry
what
a
shock
we
eat
when
i
say
we
eat
well
we
could
hit
the
tunnels
we
eat
when
i
say
we
eat
god
lighten
up
i
think
it's
funny
when
you
scream
it's
like
whoa
i
got
ta
get
me
some
better
lackeys
i
swear
you
guys
are
useless
i
shouldn't
even
take
you
on
the
hunt
great
why
don't
you
let
dead
eddie
get
your
dinner
that's
pretty
much
the
plan
giles
we
see
an
attractive
black
woman
in
the
kitchen
through
the
opening
over
the
counter
rupert
is
this
bleu
cheese
or
is
it
just
cheese
that's
gone
blue
you're
not
giles
uhm
you
know
the
door
was
open
so
i
just
uh
giles
does
still
live
here
right
he
does
he
appears
rupert
you
have
a
guest
buffy
hello
is
this
a
bad
time
no
oh
uh
forgive
me
this
uh
this
is
uh
olivia
she's
uh
an
old
friend
she's
staying
here
for
a
few
days
couldn't
pass
through
sunny
cal
without
looking
up
ol'
ripper
uh
huh
buffy's
a
uh
was
a
student
of
mine
how's
uh
how
is
university
pretty
much
the
same
as
high
school
in
the
sense
that
i
need
help
ahh
help
yes
but
this
just
looks
like
a
bad
time
no
you
guys
talk
i'll
just
go
slip
into
something
a
little
less
comfortable
so
uh
trouble
with
uh
studies
this
is
a
bad
time
you
keep
saying
that
well
it
looks
pretty
bad
i
think
someone
had
just
a
little
too
much
free
time
on
their
hands
i'm
not
supposed
to
have
a
private
life
no
'cause
you're
very
very
old
and
it's
gross
well
before
i
succumb
to
the
ravages
of
age
why
don't
you
tell
me
what
brings
you
here
there's
this
student
missing
yes
eddie
he's
supposed
to
have
left
school
but
i
just
don't
think
he
did
i
met
him
outside
last
night
and
then
i
went
back
where
we
met
and
it
looked
there
had
been
a
struggle
and
and
we
need
to
stop
this
and
eddie's
ra
said
kids
disappear
a
lot
there
could
be
a
gang
of
vampires
working
the
campus
we
need
research
ananand
charts
and
stuff
ii
still
don't
see
where
i
fit
in
you
haven't
described
anything

going
to
have
to

of

you're
out
of

homes
eddie
eddie
eddie
hey
wait
up
god
i
was
worried
that
something
had
happened
to
you
and
of
course
it
has
'cause
you're
a
vampire
i'm
sorry
i'm
not
slayer
wow

i
heard
you
might
be
coming

is
i
mean
what
a
challenge
the
slayer

you

i'm
i'm
sunday
i'll
be
killing
you
here
in
a

that
threat
gets
more
frightening
every
time
i
hear
it
uhh

just
gonna
be
a
monster
sarcasm
rally
i'm
in
for
a
piece
everybody

this
is
totally
mine
ok
but
you
gotta
share
the
eatin'
'cause
i'm
thinkin'
slayer's
blood's
gotta
bewhoalike
thai
stick
i
thought
people
were
suppose
to
get
smarter
in
college
yeah
i
think
you
had
a
lot
of
misconceptions
about
college
like
that
anyone
would
be
caught
dead
wearing
that
don't
take
this
the
wrong
way
but
you
fight
like
a
girl
freshmen
nnnnno
the
best
part
was
when
you
ragged
on
her
clothes
she
was
like
'no
not
the
ensemble'
those
jeans
with
the
little
patches
she
has
no
one
to
blame
but
herself
i
heard
they're
coming
back
not
if
i
kill
every
single
person
who
wears
them
i
still
think
you
should've
let
us
have
a
piece
we
could've
finished
here
off
she's
not
gonna
last
the
night
she's
a
done
deal
in
fact
guys
you're
gonna
hit
the
tunnels

college

been
fighting
oh
uh
they
started
it
just
as
long
as
you're
being
careful
ii
really
didn't
think
you'd
show
up
here
for
a
while
oh
i
didn't
have
classes
today
and
everything's
just
been
so
hectic
i
figured
it'd
be
nice
to
come

ii
didn't
think
you'd
be
back

a
couple
of
weeks
uh
but
i
didn't
move
anything
it's
still
your
room
you
filled
it
with
packing
crates
yeah
but
i
didn't
move
anything
if
it's
still
my
room
shouldn't
i
still
be
able
to
fit
in
it
well
it's
just
for
a
couple
of
weeks
while
we
do
inventory
at
the
gallery
i
just
really
didn't
think
you'd
be
back
so
soon
neither
did
i
hello
hello
the
whole
world
in
front
of
her
and
she
comes
back
to
this
dive
xander
hey
buff

did
you
get
back
couple
days
ago

freak
of
nature
why
didn't
you
call
me

knew
you

starting
the
whole
college
adventure

me
'grand
canyon'
you
saw
the
grand
canyon
well
i
saw
the
movie
'grand
canyon'
on
cable
really
lame
hunh
basically
i
got
as
far
as
oxnard
and
the
engine
fell
out
of
my
car
and
that
was
literally
so
i
ended
up
washing
dishes
at
'the
fabulous
ladies
night
club'
for
about
a
month
and
a
half
while
i
tried
to
pay
for
the
repairs
no
one
really
bothered
me
or
even
spoke
to
me
until
one
night
when
one
of
the
male
strippers
called
in
sick
and
no
power
on
this
earth
will
make
me
tell
you
the
rest
of
that
story
suffice
to
say
i
traded
my
car
in
for
one
that
wasn't
entirely
made
of
rust
came
trundling
back
home
to
the
arms
of
my
loving
parents
where
everything
was
exactly
as
it
was
except
i
sleep
in
the
basement
and
i
have
to
pay
rent
how's
college
male
strippers
no
power
on
this
earth
ok
college
is
good
ok
uh
once
more
with
even
less
feeling
no
really
ii
mean
willow's
in
heaven
and
oz
has
this
really
cool
house
off
campus
with
the
band
and
you're
sitting
here
alone
at
the
bronze
looking
like
you
just
got
diagnosed
with
cancer
of
the
puppy
it's
just
there
was
this
vampire
and
she
took
me
down
and
i
just
i
don't
know
how
to
stop
her
then
where's
the
gang
avengers
assemble
let's
get
it
going
no
i
don't
want
to
bug
them
i
mean
they're
just
starting
school
and
they
don't
need
this
ok
buff
what's
the
'what'
here
it's
just
what
if
i
can't
cut
it
can't
cut
what
slaying
slaying
everything
buffy
this
is
all
about
fear
it's
understandable
but
you
can't
let
it
control
you
'fear
leads
to
anger
anger
leads
to
hate
hate
leads
to
anger'
no
wait
hold
on
'fear
leads
to
hate
hate
leads
to
the
dark
side'
hold
on
no
umm
'first
you
get
the
women
then
you
get
the
money
then
you'
okay
can
we
forget
that
thanks
for
the
dadaist
pep
talk
i
feel
much
more
abstract
now
the
point
is
you're
buffy
yeah
maybe
in
high
school
i
was
buffy
and
now
in
college
you're
betty
louise
yeah
i'm
betty
louise
plotnick
of
east
cupcake
illinois
or
i
might
as
well
be
buffy
i've
gone
through
some
fairly
dark
times
in
my
life
faced
some
scary
things
among
them
the
kitchen
at
'the
fabulous
ladies
night
club'
let
me
tell
you
something
when
it's
dark
and
i'm
all
alone
and
i'm
scared
or
freaked
out
or
whatever
i
always
think
'what
would
buffy
do'
you're
my
hero
ok
sometimes
when
it's
dark
and
i'm
all
alone
i
think
'what
is
buffy
wearing'
can
that
be
one
of
those
things
you
never
ever
tell
me
about
it's
a
deal
let's
put
this
bitch
in
the
ground
what
do
you
say
i
think
i
say
thank
you
and
nothing
says
thank
you
like
dollars
in
the
waistband
ok
what
do
we
do
first
kids
disappearing
every
year
not
too
many
just
enough
so
that
everyone
thinks
they
up
and
left
i
can't
believe
the
vampires
took
your
stuff
murder
i
expect
but
petty
larceny
seems
so
petty
they
have
to
be
keeping
it
somewhere
on
campus
or
at
least
near
by
hey
how
far
back
do
the
disappearances
go
buffy
types
at
the
keyboard
we
see
she's
still
not
using
her
left
arm
uhh
they
weren't
too
common
before
'82
match
number
check
this
out
'psi
theta
loses
it's
charter
building
to
be
closed
for
renovation'
1982
look
at
this
'former
psi
theta
fraternity
house
lies
dormant
while
zoning
issues
drag
on
before
the
city
council'
we
have
a
winner
looks
pretty
cherry
you
up
for
a
little
reconnaissance
you
mean
where
we
all
sculpt
and
paint
and
stuff
no
that
was
the
renaissance
oh
i've
had
a
really
long
week
let's
go
look
at
the
house
score
look
how
tough
i
am
oh
that's
my
skirt
you're
never
going
to
fit
in
it
with
those
hips
we
have
to
kill
them
we
need
weapons
i
don't
see
my
weapons
trunk
down
there
it
was
right
by
my
bed
mr
gordo
go
to
my
room
if
it's
not
there
try
willow's
i'll
keep
an
eye
my
diary
uhoh
score
i'll
hurry
laugh
all
you
want
this
time
we
play
it
my
way
and
the
rules
are
just
going
to
be
a
little
bit
unh
ahh
ah
oh
say
don't
i
know
you
from
beating
the
crap
out
of
you
i
just
thought
i'd
drop
in
get
it
drop
in
boy
tough
room
i
must
say
you've
really
got
me
now
i
mean
it's
a
diabolical
plan
throw
yourself
at
my
feet
with
a
broken
arm
and
no
weapons
of
any
kind
how'm
i
going
to
get
out
of
this
one
you
got
a
nice
setup
here
but
you
made
one
mistake
yeah
what
was
that
well
i'm
not
actually
positive
but
statistically
speaking
people
usually
make
at
least
it
seems
kind
of
weird
yeah
weird's
a
pretty
good
word
for
it
buffy
wouldn't
just
take
off
ththat's
just
not
in
her
nature
except
for
that
one
time
she
disappeared
for
several
months
and
changed
he
name
but
there
were
circumstances
then
there's
no
circumstances
does
buffy
have
a
history
of
emotional
problems
'cause
on
my
request
form
i
was
pretty
specific
about
a
stable
nonsmoker
i
don't
think
this
is
her
handwriting
i
bet
there
were
circumstances
we've
probably
been
so
wrapped
up
in
our
own
petty
lives
that
that
we
totally
missed
the
circumstances
we're
bad
friends
let's
think
this
through
how
can
you
be
so
calm
long
arduous
hours
of
practice
now
either
buffy
took
off
or
she
was
robbed
or
it's
a
prank
xander
how
are
my
guys
i
don't
know
you
do
i
no
this
is
very
intrusive
isn't
it
little
bit
xander
kathy
do
we
hug
i
think
we're
too
manly
what's
the
prank
prank
oh
the
room
well
some
friends
of
buffy's
played
a
funny
joke
and
they
took
her
stuff
and
now
she
wants
us
to
help
get
it
back
from
her
friends
who
sleep
all
day
and
have
no
tans
oh
those
friends
funny
guys
they
took
the
chest
well
let's
go
let's
go
to
our
friend
it's
nice
meeting
you
kathy
you
too
let's
go
to
will's
get
supplies
is
buffy
in
danger
she's
in
a
holding
pattern
we've
got
some
time
oh
and
this
this
is
my
favorite
item
you
don't
want
to
touch
that
you
know
this
arm's
not
looking
so
good
it
might
have
to
come
off
you
want
to
know
the
truth
i
only
need
one
this
is
startin'
to
suck
woah
when
you
look
back
at
this
in
the
three
seconds
it'll
take
you
to
turn
to
dust
i
think
you'll
find
the
mistake
was
touching
my
stuff
what
about
breaking
your
arm
how'd
that
feel
let
me
answer
that
with
a
headbutt
and
for
the
record
the
arm
is
hurt
not
broken
hey
buff
need
a
hand
no
thanks
i'm
good
so
all
that
other
stuff
in
there
that's
just
gonna
sit
in
there
right
uh
i
mean
no
one
owns
it
in
the
strictest
sense
it
seems
wrong
somehow
dibs
on
the
rowing
machine
buffy
hi
giles
what's
with
the
arsenal
i've
been
awake
all
night

what
to
expect
