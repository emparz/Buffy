the
simple
and
ubiquitous

two

chapters
six
through
eight
by
tomorrow
people
can
i
see
you
for
a
moment
i
gather
you
had
a
few
problems
at
your
last
school
well
what
teenager
doesn't
cut
school
get
in
fights
burn
down
the
gymnasium
well
that
fire
i
mean
there
was
major
extenuating
circumstances
actually
it's
uh
kinda
funny
can't
wait
to
see
what
you're
gonna
do
here
destructo
girl
that's
me
but
i
suspect
it's
gonna
be
great
you
mean
'great'
in
a
bad
way
you
have
a
first
rate
mind
and
you
can
think
on
your
feet
imagine
what
you
could
accomplish
if
you
actually
did
the
the
homework
thing
the
homework
thing
i
understand
you
probably
have
a
good
excuse
for
not
doing
it
amazingly
enough
i
don't
care
i
know
you
can
excel
in
this
class
and
so
i
expect
no
less
is
that
clear
yeah
sorry
don't
be
sorry
be
smart
and
please
don't
listen
to
the
principal
or
anyone
else's
negative
opinion
about
you
let's
make
'em
eat
that
permanent
record
whadaya
say
okay
thanks
chapters
six
through
eight
the
first
date's
the
worst
date
it's
hard
to
know
just
what
to
do
and
i
take
you
to
dinner
you
don't
eat
you
just
play
with
your
food
and
there's
something
familiar
about
every
word
you
say
it's
hard
to
believe
it's
happened
again
i
already
met
you
and
i
already
met
you
you're
like
my
last
girlfriend
yes
and
the
girlfriend
i
had
before
her
seven
including
cheryl
i'll
tell
you
though
her
sister
was
lookin'
to
make
it
eight
ooo
cheryl's
sister
the
one
in
college
home
for
the
holidays
and
lookin'
for
love
she's
not
my
type
though
girls
really
gotta
have
something
to
go
with
me
something
like
a
lobotomy
xander
how
many
times
you
score
well
uh
it's
just
a
question
are
we
talking
today
or
the
whole
week
ooo
duty
calls
babes
what
are
you
doing
work
with
me
here
blayne
had
the
nerve
to
question
my
manliness
i'm
just
gonna
give
him
a
visual
we'll
show
him
i
don't
believe
it
i
know
and
after
all
my
conquests
who's
that
that
must
be
angel
i
think
that
weird
guy
that
warned
her
about
all
the
vampires
that's
him
i'll
bet
you
well
he's
buff
she
never
said
anything
about
him
being
buff
you
think
he's
buff
he's
a
very
attractive
man
how
come
that
never
came
up
well
look
who's
here
hi
i'd
say
it's
nice
to
see
you
but
then
we
both
know
that's
a
big
fib
i
won't
be
long
no
you'll
just
give
me
a
cryptic
warning
about
some
exciting
new
catastrophe
and
then
disappear
into
the
night
right
you're
cold
you
can
take
it
i
mean
you
look
cold
oh
right
give
her
your
jacket
it's
a
balmy
night
no
one
needs
to
be
trading
clothing
out
there
a
little
big
on
me
what
happened
i
didn't
pay
attention
to
somebody
with
a
big
fork
he's
coming
the
fork
guy
don't
let
him
corner
you
don't
give
him
a
moment's
mercy
he'll
rip
your
throat
out
okay
i'll
give
you
improved
marks
for
that
one
ripping
a
throat
out
it's
a
strong
visual
it's
not
cryptic
i
have
to
go
sweet
dreams
to
you
too
that's
all
he
said
fork
guy
that's
all
cryptic
guy
said
fork
guy
i
think
there
are
too
many
guys
in
your
life
i'll
see
what
i
can
find
out
god
every
day
here
is
the
same
bright
sunny
beautiful
however
can
we
escape
this
torment
really
good
morning
mornin'
guess
what
i
just
heard
in
the
office
no
dr
gregory
today
ergo
those
of
us
who
blew
off
our
science
homework
aren't
as
dumb
as
we
look
what
happened
is
he
sick
they
didn't
say
anything
about
sick
something
about
missing
he's
missing
well
let
me
think
um
the
cheerleaders
were
modeling
their
new
short
skirts
that
kinda
got
yeah
yeah
they
said
missing
which
is
bad
if
something's
wrong
yeah
he's
one
of
the
only
teachers
that
doesn't
think
buffy's
a
felon
i'm
really
sorry
i'm
sure
he'll
i
uh
huh
uh
huh
huh
could
you
help
me
uuuuuuhhhhhh
yes
i'm
looking
for
science
109
oh
it's
um
i
go
there
every
day
oh
god
where
is
it
hi
blayne
mall
i'm
going
there
right
now
it's
not
far
from
the
varsity
field
where
i
took
allcity
last
year
oh
thank
you
blayne
it's
funny
how
the
earth
never
opens
up
and
swallows
you
when
you
want
it
to
what's
wrong
dr
gregory
dropped
his
glasses
why
wouldn't
he
pick
them
up
my
name
is
natalie
french
and
i
will
be
substituting
for
dr
gregory
do
you
know
when
he's
coming
back
no
i
don't
um
buffy
they
just
call
and
tell
me
where
they
want
me
i'll
tell
you
where
i
want
you
excuse
me
blayne
uh
i
was
just
wondering
if
you
were
gonna
pick
up
where
dr
gregory
left
off
yes
his
notes
tell
me
you
were
right
in
the
middle
of
insect
life
the
praying
mantis
is
a
fascinating
creature
forced
to
live
alone
who
can
tell
me
why
buffy
well
the
words
'bugugly'
kinda
spring
to
mind
there
is
nothing
ugly
about
these
unique
creatures
the
reason
they
live
alone
is
because
they're
cannibals
eww
oh
well
it's
hardly
their
fault
it's
the
way
nature
designed
them
noble
solitary
and
prolific
over
1800
species
worldwide
and
in
nearly
all
of
them
the
female
is
larger
and
more
aggressive
than
the
male
nothing
wrong
with
an
aggressive
female
the
california
mantis
lays
her
eggs
and
then
finds
a
mate
to
fertilize
them
once
he's
played
his
part
she
covers
the
eggs
in
a
protective
sack
and
attaches
it
to
a
leaf
or
twig
out
of
danger
now
if
she's
done
her
job
correctly
in
a
few
months
she'll
have
several
hundred
offspring
you
know
we
should
make
some
model
egg
sacks
for
the
science
fair
who
would
like
to
help
me
do
that
after
school
good
hot
dog
surprise
be
still
my
heart
call
me
oldfashioned
i
don't
want
any
more
surprises
in
my
hot
dogs
i
wonder
what
she
sees
in
me
it's
probably
the
quiet
good
looks
coupled
with
a
certain
smoky
magnetism
miss
french
you
two're
probably
a
little
young
to
understand
what
an
older
woman
would
see
in
a
younger
man
oh
i
understand
good
the
younger
man
is
too
dumb
to
wonder
why
an
older
woman
can't
find
someone
her
own
age
and
too
desperate
to
care
about
the
surgical
improvements
what
surgical
improvements
well
he
is
young
and
so
terribly
innocent
hey
those
that
can
do
those
that
can't
laugh
at
those
who
can
do
gotta
carb
up
for
my
oneonone
with
miss
french
today
when's
yours
oh
right
tomorrow
you
came
in
second
i
came
in
first
guess
that's
what
they
call
natural
selection
guess
it's
what
they
call
a
rehearsal
excuse
you
medically
prescribed
lunch
my
doctor
ships
it
daily
i'll
only
be
here
as
long
as
i
can
hold
my
breath
his
head
his
head
oh
my
god
where's
his
head
here
drink
this
no
thank
you
i've
never
seen
i
mean
i've
never
seen
anything
like
that
was
new
who
would
wanna
hurt
dr
gregory
uh
he
didn't
have
any
enemies
on
the
staff
that
i'm
aware
of
he
was
a
civilized
man
i
liked
him
so
did
i
well
we're
gonna
find
out
who
did
this
count
on
it
what
do
we
know
oh
not
a
lot
um
he
was
killed
here
on
campus
i'm
guessing
the
last
day
we
saw
him
how
do
you
work
that
out
he
didn't
change
his
clothing
this
is
a
question
that
no
one
particularly
wants
to
hear
but
where
did
they
put
his
head
good
point
i
didn't
wanna
hear
that
angel
he
warned
me
that
something
was
coming
yes
yes
he
did
didn't
he
i
wish
i
knew
what
he
meant
i've
been
trying
to
gather
more
information
about
the
master
our
uh
local
vampire
king
there
was
one
oblique
reference
to
a
a
a
vampire
who
displeased
the
master
and
cut
his
hand
off
in
penance
cut
off
his
hand
and
replaced
it
with
a
fork
i
don't
know
what
he
replaced
it
with
so
why
would
he
come
after
a
teacher
i'm
not
certain
he
did
there
was
an
incident
two
nights
ago
uh
involving
a
homeless
person
in
weatherly
park
he
was
practically
shredded
but
uh
nothing
like
dr
gregory
fork
guy
doesn't
do
heads
not
historically
and
dr
gregory's
blood
wasn't
drained
so
there's
something
else
out
there
besides
silverwareman
oh
this
is
fun
we're
on
monster
island
we're
on
a
hellmouth
it's
a
center
of
mystical
convergence
guess
it's
the
same
thing
well
unpleasant
things
do
gravitate
here
it's
true
but
uh
we
don't
know
there's
anything
besides
this
chap
he's
still
our
likely
suspect
where
was
that
guy
killed
weatherly
park
buffy
i
know
you're
upset
but
uh
this
is
no
time
to
go
hunting
not
until
we
know
more
please
promise
me
you
won't
do
anything
rash
cross
my
heart
shouldn't
be
out
here
at
night
little
lady
dangerous
hold
it
police
did
you
see
that
i
got
nothing
here
i
heard
it
spread
out
let's
go
over
here
this
way
this
way
alright
you
went
hunting
last
night
yes
when
you
assured
me
you
wouldn't
yes
i
lied
i'm
a
bad
person
let's
move
on
did
you
see
someone
with
a
fork
more
like
a
jumbo
claw
oh
well
uh
at
least
you're
not
hurt
and
i
saw
something
else
something
much
more
interesting
than
your
average
runofthemill
killer
vampire
oh
do
you
know
miss
french
the
teacher
that's
subbing
for
dr
gregory
yes
yes
she's
lovely
in
a
a
common
extremely
well
proportioned
way
well
i'm
chasing
claw
guy
last
night
and
miss
well
proportioned
is
heading
home
the
claw
guy
takes
one
look
at
her
and
runs
screaming
for
cover
he
what
ran
away
he
was
petrified
of
miss
french
uh
huh
so
i'm
an
undead
monster
that
can
shave
with
my
hand
how
many
things
am
i
afraid
of
not
many
and
not
substitute
teachers
as
a
rule
so
what's
her
deal
i
think
perhaps
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
we
kept
an
eye
on
her
then
i
better
get
to
class
you
were
there
you
saw
dr
gregory
didn't
you
um
you
mean
yesterday
in
the
cafeteria
when
we
found
him
don't
say
dead
or
decapitated
or
decomposing
i'd
stay
away
from
dwords
altogether
but
you
witnessed
the
event
so
this
way
please
well
no
i'm
gonna
be
late
for
biology
extremely
late
you
have
to
see
a
counselor
everyone
who
saw
the
body
has
to
see
a
crisis
counselor
but
i
really
don't
need
we
all
need
help
with
our
feelings
otherwise
we
bottle
them
up
and
before
you
know
it
powerful
laxatives
are
involved
i
really
believe
if
we
all
reach
out
to
one
another
we
can
beat
this
thing
i'm
always
here
if
you
need
a
hug
but
not
a
real
hug
because
there's
no
touching
this
school
is
sensitive
to
wrong
touching
but
i
really
really
don't
no
you
have
to
talk
to
a
counselor
and
start
the
healing
you
have
to
heal
but
mr
flutie
i
heal
i
don't
know
what
to
say
it
was
really
i
mean
one
minute
you're
in
your
normal
life
and
then
who's
in
the
fridge
it
really
gets
to
you
a
thing
like
that
it
was
let's
just
say
i
haven't
been
able
to
eat
a
thing
since
yesterday
i
think
i
lost
like
seven
and
a
half
ounces
way
swifter
than
that
socalled
diet
that
quack
put
me
on
oh
i'm
not
saying
that
we
should
kill
a
teacher
every
day
just
so
i
can
lose
weight
i'm
just
saying
when
tragedy
strikes
we
have
to
look
on
the
bright
side
you
know
like
how
even
used
mercedes
still
have
leather
seats
keep
your
eyes
straight
ahead
on
your
own
test
i
think
you
meant
'pollination'
for
number
fourteen
i'll
see
you
here
after
school
oh
great
a
pop
quiz
no
i'm
not
saying
she
craned
her
neck
we
are
talking
full
on
exorcist
twist
ouch
which
reminds
me
how
come
blayne
who
worked
with
her
oneon
one
yesterday
isn't
here
today
inquiring
minds
wanna
know
any
luck
um
i've
not
found
any
creature
as
yet
that
strikes
terror
in
a
vampire's
heart
try
looking
under
things
that
can
turn
their
heads
all
the
way
around
nothing
human
can
do
that
no
nothing
human
there
are
some
insects
that
can
whatever
she
is
i'm
gonna
be
ready
for
her

teacher's
conference

an
hour

her
factoid
3
her
fashion
sense

a
helpful
note
i
had
a
chum
at
oxford
carlyle

fairy
tales

giant
insect
okay
don't
panic
i'll
warn
him
but
i
need
you
to
hack
onto
the
coroner's
office
for
me
well
what
are
we
looking
for
autopsy
on
dr
gregory
i've
been
trying
to
figures
out
these
marks
that
i
saw
on
his
corpse
i'm
thinking
they
were
teeth
and
uh
these
cuddlies
should
definitely
be
brushing
after
every
meal
and
you
were
saying
something
about
a
beast
oh
uh
yeah
i
just
need
to
make
one
transatlantic
telephone
call
um
this
computer
invasion
that
willow's
performing
on
the
coroner's
office
one
one
assumes
it
is
entirely
legal
entirely
of
course
right
wasn't
here
didn't
see
it
couldn't
have
stopped
you
good
idea
hey
hey
so
how'd
it
go
with
miss
french
well
it's
a
bit
demanding
being
her
absolute
favorite
guy
in
the
universe
but
i'll
muddle
through
xander
she's
not
what
she
seems
i
know
she's
so
much
more
okay
um
i'm
gonna
have
to
tell
you
something
about
her
and
i'm
gonna
need
you
to
really
listen
okay
okay
i
don't
think
she's
human
i
see
so
if
she's
not
human
she's
technically
a
big
bug
this
sounds
really
weird
i'm
aware
of
that
it
doesn't
sound
weird
at
all
i
completely
understand
i've
met
someone
and
you're
jealous
what
look
there's
nothing
i
can
do
about
it
uh
there's
just
this
certain
chemical
thing
between
miss
french
and
me
i
know
i
read
all
about
it
it's
call
um
a
pheromone
it's
a
chemical
attractant
that
insects
give
off
she's
not
an
insect
she's
a
woman
okay
and
hard
as
that
may
be
for
you
to
conceive
an
actual
woman
finds
me
attractive
i
realize
it's
no
mystery
guy
handing
out
leather
jackets
and
while
we're
on
the
subject
what
kind
of
a
girlie
name
is
'angel'

the
creature
you

yyou
were
right
all
along
about
everything
well
nno
you
weren't
right
about
your
mother
coming
back
as
a
pekinese
but
uh
try
to
rest
old
man
yes
ta
bye
now
dr
ferris
carlyle
spent
years
transcribing
a
lost
pregermanic
language
what
he
discovered
he
kept
to
himself
until
several
teenage
boys
were
murdered
in
the
cotswolds
then
he
went
hunting
for
it
it
being
uh
he
calls
her
a
shemantis
this
type
of
creature
the
kleptesvirgo
or
or
virginthief
appears
in
in
many
cultures
the
greek
sirens
the
celtic
sea
maidens
who
who
tore
the
living
flesh
from
the
bones
of
um
giles
while
we're
young
uh
well
basically
the
uh
the
shemantis
assumes
the
form
of
a
beautiful
woman
and
then
lures
innocent
virgins
back
to
her
nest
virgins
well
xander's
not
a
uh
i
mean
he's
probably
gonna
die
okay
okay
so
this
thing
is
breeding
and
we
need
to
find
it
and
snuff
it
any
tips
on
the
snuffing
part
uh
carlyle
recommends
cleaving
all
body
parts
with
a
sharp
blade
slice
and
dice
well
whatever
you
do
it
had
better
be
certain
and
swift
this
beast
is
extremely
dangerous
well
your
buddy
carlyle
faced
it
and
he's
still
around
yes
in
a
straitjacket
howling
his
innards
out
day
and
night
okay
admiral
way
to
inspire
the
troops
sorry
xander's
not
home
he
told
his
mom
he
was
going
to
his
teacher's
house
to
work
on
a
science
project
he
didn't
tell
her
where
see
if
you
can
get
her
address
off
the
substitute
rolls
and
you
need
to
record
bat
sonar
and
fast
bat
sonar
right
what
bats
eat
them
the
mantis
hears
sonar
its
entire
nervous
system
