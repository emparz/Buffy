you
know
it's
probably
none
of
my
business
but
i
just
gotta
ask
you
smell
this
bad
when
you
were
alive
'cause
if
it's
a
postmortem
thing
then
boy
is
my
face
red
but
just
so
you
know
the
fastgrowing
field
of
personal
grooming
has
come
a
long
way
since
you
became
a
vampire
you're
going
but
you
were
having
so
much
fun
a
minute
ago
buffy
what
happened
i
can't
believe
i
passed
out
do
you
think
i'm
a
total
wuss
now
oh
yeah
i
like
a
girl
who
can
play
a
few
hard
sets
of
tennis
with
a
major
stab
wound
you
said
it
wasn't
that
bad
i
said
i've
seen
worse
there's
a
difference
well
at
least
no
major
organs
got
kebabed
i
still
think
you
need
to
see
a
real
doctor
that
would
put
me
in
a
real
hospital
which
would
get
my
real
mom
real
freaked
out
i
can't
do
it
don't
worry
accelerated
healing
powers
come
with
the
slayer
package
and
the
boyfriend
who
comes
complete
with
combat
medical
training
that's
just
a
buffy
summers
bonus
so
tell
me
about
the
bad
guy
or
guys
what
do
you
think
they
were
vampire
how
many
one
so
what
he
was
like
a
supervampire
or
something
no
he
was
the
regular
kind
he
just
beat
me
that
ever
happen
before
i'm
in
the
best
physical
shape
of
my
life
i
mean
if
you're
asking
how
it
happened
i
don't
dawn
sorry
to
interrupt
the
sexcapades
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
that
mom's
coming
hi
riley
hey
mrs
summers

you
feeling
i'm
fine
bordering
on
chipper
and
tomorrow
planning
on
being
obnoxious
glad
to

some
nail
polish

doomed
before

even
begin
but
you
keep
pushing
the
envelope
honey
did
i
just
pull
a
slayerrelated
mom
coverup
thing
come
on
who's
the
man
you

a
very
short
annoying
man

household
duty

by
yourself
just
a
sweep

the
hand

choochoo
it
means
to
follow
him
that
or
wait
here
for
him
ask
hey
riley
what's
the
all
about
it
means
yell
real
loud
so
the
vampires
who
don't
know
we're
coming
will
have
a
sporting
chance
see
now
he's
all
mean
and
sarcastic
that's
because
you
were
doing
all
the
yelling
mr
stealthypants
it's
their
fault
guys
i'm
thinking
if
we
split
up
we
could
cover
more
ground
tell
you
what
i'll
take
the
cemeteries
you
guys
get
the
bronze
are
we
not
being
covert
enough
we're
sorry
sorry
we'll
be
sneakier
promise
okay
just
ditch
the
chips
and
watch
my
back
done
you
know
what
he's
like
he's
like
a
cat
you
know
a
big
jungle
cat
how
come
i'm
not
like
that
it's
just
so
cool
i
think
you're
cool
here's
another
one
early
18th
century
slayer
good
let's
hope
she'll
be
more
helpful
than
this
last
one
why
what
does
it
say
same
as
all
the
others
slayer
called
blah
blah
great
protector
blah
blah
scary
battles
blah
blah
oops
she's
dead
where
are
the
details
details
well
it
says
this
slayer
forged
her
own
weapons
gotta
love
a
gal
with
an
anvil
but
where
are
the
details
of
the
slayer's
last
battle
you
know
what
made
that
fight
special
why
did
she
lose
you
didn't
lose
last
night
buffy
you
just
got
really
close
i
slipped
up
giles
i've
been
training
harder
than
ever
and
still
i
and
there's
nothing
in
any
of
these
books
to
help
me
understand
why
i
mean
look
i
realize
that
every
slayer
comes
with
an
expiration
mark
on
the
package
but
i
want
mine
to
be
a
long
time
from
now
like
a
cheeto
if
there
were
just
a
few
good
descriptions
of
what
took
out
the
other
slayers
maybe
it
would
help
me
to
understand
my
mistake
to
keep
it
from
happening
again
yes
well
the
problem
is
after
a
final
battle
it's
difficult
to
get
any
well
the
slayer's
not
she's
rather
it's
okay
to
use
the
dword
giles
dead
and
hence
not
very
forthcoming
why
didn't
the
watchers
keep
fuller
accounts
of
it
the
journals
just
stop
well
i
suppose
if
they're
anything
like
me
they
just
find
the
whole
subject
too
unseemly
damn
love
ya
but
you
watchers
are
such
prigs
sometimes
painful
i
was
going
to
say
but
you're
right
accounts
of
the
final
battles
would
be
very
helpful
but
there's
no
one
left
to
tell
the
tales
what
ow
wait
not
ow
you
feeling
all
right
slayer
this
stuff
usually
hurts
don't
even
start
spike
what
do
you
want
slayers
you
killed
two
of
them
i
did
you're
gonna
show
me
how
you
know
there
quite
a
few
american
beers
that
are
highly
underrated
this
unfortunately
is
not
one
of
them
update
spike
we're
not
here
to
discuss
the
fine
choice
of
hops
it's
about
two
slayers
one
in
china
during
the
boxer
rebellion
one
in
new
york
both
got
killed
by
you
tell
the
tale
you
get
the
cash
right
you
want
to
learn
all
about
how
i
bested
the
slayers
and
you
want
to
learn
fast
right
then
we
fought
i
won
the
end
pay
up
that's
not
what
i
what
did
you
want
eh
a
quick
demo
a
blowforblow
description
you
can
map
out
and
memorize
it's
not
about
the
moves
love
and
since
i
agreed
to
your
little
proposition
we
can
do
this
my
way
wings
what
spicy
buffalo
wings
order
me
up
a
plate
i'm
feelin'
peckish
excuse
me
as
i
thought
some
nasty
thing
got
a
taste
of
you
don't
get
all
excited
i'm
fine
oh
right
stuck
in
a
dark
corner
with
a
creature
you
loathe
diggin'
up
past
uglies
'cause
you're
fine
just
tell
me
what
i
want
to
know
i
told
you
no
one's
narrating
on
an
empty
stomach
here
were
you
born
this
big
a
pain
in
the
ass
what
can
i
tell
you
baby
i've
always
been
bad
luminous
oh
no
no
no
irradiant's
better
care
for
an
hors
d'oeuvre
sir
oh
quickly
i'm
the
very
spirit
of
vexation
what's
another
word
for
gleaming
it's
a
perfectly
perfect
word
as
many
words
go
but
the
bother
is
nothing
rhymes
you
see
cecily
i
mean
to
point
out
that
it's
something
of
a
mystery
and
the
police
should
keep
an
open
mind
ah
william
favor
us
with
your
opinion
what
do
you
make
of
this
rash
of
disappearances
sweeping
through
our
town
animals
or
thieves
i
prefer
not
to
think
of
such
dark
ugly
business
at
all
that's
what
the
police
are
for
i
prefer
placing
my
energies
into
creating
things
of
beauty
i
see
well
don't
withhold
william
rescue
us
from
a
dreary
topic
careful
the
inks
are
still
wet
please
it's
not
finished
don't
be
shy
my
heart
expands'tis
grown
a
bulge
in
itinspired
by
your
beauty
effulgent
effulgent
and
that's
actually
one
of
his
better
compositions
have
you
heard
they
call
him
william
the
bloody
because
of
his
bloody
awful
poetry
it
suits
him
i'd
rather
have
a
railroad
spike
through
my
head
than
listen
to
that
awful
stuff
cecily
oh
leave
me
alone
oh
they're
vulgarians
they're
not
like
you
and
i
you
and
i
i'm
going
to
ask
you
a
very
personal
question
and
i
demand
an
honest
answer
do
you
understand
your
poetry
it's
they're
not
written
about
me
are
they
they're
about
how
i
feel
yes
but
are
they
about
me
every
syllable
oh
god
oh
i
know
it's
sudden
and
please
if
they're
no
good
they're
only
words
but
the
feeling
behind
them
i
love
you
cecily
please
stop
i
know
i'm
a
bad
poet
but
i'm
a
good
man
and
all
i
ask
is
that
that
you
try
to
see
me
i
do
see
you
that's
the
problem
you're
nothing
to
me
william
you're
beneath
me
watch
where
you're
going
and
i
wonder
what
possible
catastrophe
came
crashing
down
from
heaven
and
brought
this
dashing
stranger
to
tears
nothing
i
wish
to
be
alone
oh
i
see
you
a
man
surrounded
by
fools
who
cannot
see
his
strength
his
vision
his
glory
that
and
burning
baby
fish
swimming
all
around
your
head
that's
quite
close
enough
i've
heard
tales
of
london
pickpockets
you'll
not
be
getting
my
purse
i
tell
you
don't
need
a
purse
your
wealth
lies
here
and
here
in
the
spirit
and
imagination
you
walk
in
worlds
the
others
can't
begin
to
imagine
oh
yes
i
mean
no
i
mean
mother's
expecting
me
i
see
what
you
want
something
glowing
and
glistening
something
effulgent
effulgent
do
you
want
it
oh
yes
god
yes
guys
what
you
got
that's
him
let's
go
it
sounds
like
a
party
in
there
forget
about
crashing
there's
too
many
of
them
we'll
come
back
at
daybreak
when
they're
asleep
and
we're
better
armed
it's
okay
we
can
kill
them
just
as
dead
in
the
morning
so
you
traded
up
on
the
food
chain
then
what
no
please
don't
make
it
sound
like
something
you'd
flip
past
on
the
discovery
channel
becoming
a
vampire
is
a
profound
and
powerful
experience
i
could
feel
this
new
strength
coursing
through
me
getting
killed
made
me
feel
alive
for
the
very
first
time
i
was
through
living
by
society's
rules
decided
to
make
a
few
of
my
own
of
course
in
order
to
do
that
i
had
to
get
myself
a
gang
perhaps
it's
my
advancing
years
that
makes
me
so
forgetful
william
remind
me
why
don't
we
kill
you
ike
what's
that
it's
spike
now
you'd
do
well
to
remember
it
mate
i'm
not
your
mate
and
when
did
you
start
talking
like
that
look
we
barely
got
out
of
london
alive
because
of
you
everywhere
we
go
it's
the
same
story
and
now
you've
got
me
and
my
women
hiding
in
the
luxury
of
a
mine
shaft
all
because
william
the
bloody
likes
the
attention
this
is
not
a
reputation
we
need
oh
i'm
sorry
did
i
sully
our
good
name
we're
vampires
all
the
more
reason
to
use
a
certain
amount
of
finesse
bollocks
that
stuff's
for
the
frilly
cuffsandcollars
crowd
i'll
take
a
good
brawl
any
day
and
every
time
you
do
we
become
the
hunted
i
think
our
boys
are
going
to
fight
the
king
of
cups
expects
a
picnic
but
this
is
not
his
birthday
good
point
yeah
you
know
what
i
prefer
to
being
hunted
getting
caught
that's
a
brilliant
strategy
really
pure
cunning
sod
off
come
on
when
was
the
last
time
you
unleashed
it
all
out
fight
in
a
mob
back
against
the
wall
nothing
but
fists
and
fangs
don't
you
ever
get
tired
of
fights
you
know
you're
going
to
win
no
a
real
kill
a
good
kill
it
takes
pure
artistry
without
that
we're
just
animals
poofter
now
you're
gettin'
it
you
can't
keep
this
up
forever
if
i
can't
teach
you
maybe
someday
an
angry
crowd
will
that
or
the
slayer
what's
a
slayer
after
that
i
was
obsessed
i
mean
to
most
vampires
the
slayer
was
the
subject
of
cold
sweat
and
frightened
whispers
but
i
never
hid
hell
i
sought
her
out
i
mean
if
you're
looking
for
fun
there's
death
there's
glory
and
sod
all
else
right
i
was
young
so
how'd
you
kill
her
funny
you
should
ask
lesson
the
first
a
slayer
must
always
reach
for
her
weapon
i've
already
got
mine
a
good
thing
too
become
a
vampire
you've
got
nothing
to
fear
nothing
but
one
girl
that's
you
honey
back
then
it
was
her
just
like
i
pictured
it
this
good
for
you
tell
my
mother
i'm
sorry
i'm
sorry
love
i
don't
speak
chinese
a
fella
could
get
used
to
this
oh
spike
look
at
the
wonderful
mess
you've
made
that's
a
slayer
you've
done
in
naughty
wicked
spike
you
ever
hear
them
saying
the
blood
of
a
slayer
is
a
powerful
aphrodisiac
here
now
have
a
taste
so
where
have
you
two
been
may
i
tell
no
need
to
be
humble
my
little
spike
just
killed
himself
a
slayer
congratulations
i
guess
that
makes
you
one
of
us
don't
be
so
glum
mate
the
way
you
tell
it
one
slayer
snuffs
it
another
one
rises
i
figure
there's
a
new
chosen
one
getting
all
chosen
as
we
speak
i
tell
you
what
when
and
if
this
new
bird
does
show
up
i'll
give
you
first
crack
at
her
i
smell
fear
yeah
this
whole
place
reeks
of
it
it's
intoxicating
let's
get
out
of
here
this
rebellion's
starting
to
bore
me
that
was
the
best
night
of
my
life
and
i've
had
some
sweet
ones
what
are
you
looking
at
you
got
off
on
it
well
yeah
i
suppose
you're
telling
me
you
don't
how
many
of
my
kind
reckon
you've
done
not
enough
and
we
just
keep
coming
but
you
can
kill
a
hundred
a
thousand
a
thousand
thousands
and
the
enemies
of
hell
besides
and
all
we
need
is
for
one
of
us
just
one
sooner
or
later
to
have
the
thing
we're
all
hoping
for
and
that
would
be
what
one
good
day
hey
you
asked
and
i'm
tellin'
the
problem
with
you
summers
is
you've
gotten
so
good
you're
starting
to
think
you're
immortal
not
really
i
just
know
i
can
handle
myself
oh
then
how
do
you
explain
this
so
that's
it
lesson
over
not
even
close
come
on
killed
with
her
own
weapon
they
ought
to
put
this
in
a
museum
you
know
what
they
put
in
museums
mostly
dead
things
give
it
to
me
what
lesson
the
second
ask
the
right
questions
you
want
to
know
how
i
beat
'em
the
question
isn't
how'd
i
win
the
question
is
why'd
they
lose
what's
the
difference
there's
a
big
difference
love
how'd
you
kill
the
second
one
hmm
a
bit
like
this
that
didn't
hurt
i
knew
i
couldn't
touch
you
if
there's
no
intent
to
hurt
you
then
that
chip
they
shoved
up
my
brain
never
activates
if
on
the
other
hand
see
now
that
hurt
yeah
this
hurt
too
how'd
you
kill
'em
spike
you're
not
ready
to
know
i'm
ready
okay
then
went
like
this
the
first
was
all
business
but
the
second
she
had
a
touch
of
your
style
she
was
cunning
resourceful
oh
did
i
mention
hot
i
could
have
danced
all
night
with
that
one
you
think
we're
dancing
that's
all
we've
ever
done
and
the
thing
about
the
dance
is
you
never
get
to
stop
every
day
you
wake
up
it's
the
same
bloody
question
that
haunts
you
is
today
the
day
i
die
death
is
on
your
heels
baby
and
sooner
or
later
it's
gonna
catch
you
and
part
of
you
wants
it
not
only
to
stop
the
fear
and
uncertainty
but
because
you're
just
a
little
bit
in
love
with
it
death
is
your
art
you
make
it
with
your
hands
day
after
day
that
final
gasp
that
look
of
peace
part
of
you
is
desperate
to
know
what's
it
like
where
does
it
lead
you
and
now
you
see
that's
the
secret
not
the
punch
you
didn't
throw
or
the
kicks
you
didn't
land
every
slayer
has
a
death
wish
even
you
the
only
reason
you've
lasted
as
long
as
you
have
is
you've
got
ties
to
the
world
your
mum
your
brat
kid
sister
the
scoobies
they
all
tie
you
here
but
you're
just
putting
off
the
inevitable
sooner
or
later
you're
gonna
want
it
and
the
second
the
second
that
happens
you
know
i'll
be
there
i'll
slip
in
have
myself
a
real
good
day
here
endeth
the
lesson
i
just
wonder
if
you'll
like
it
as
much
as
she
did
get
out
of
my
sight
now
oh

i
scare
ya

one
good
swing

want
to
i
mean
it
so

i
give
it
me

the
hell

i'm
trying
to
be
supportive
here
so
don't
drive
a
stake
through
my
heart
like
last
time
but
you
can't
kill
buffy
she's
the
slayer
she
is
so
gonna
kick
your
ass
i've
got
two
barrels
here
that'll
prove
you
wrong
i
knew
you'd
take
this
personally
you
are
so
sensitive
how
are
you
going
to
kill
her
think
the
second
you
even
point
that
thing
at
her
you're
gonna
be
all
ahhh
and
then
you'll
get
bitchslapped
up
and
down
main
street
unless
she's
had
enough
and
just
stakes
you
sure
it'll
hurt
like
hell
for
about
two
hours
but
she'll
be
dead
just
a
little
longer
than
that
fine
but
don't
come
crying
to
me
when
you
fail
you
couldn't
kill
her
before
you
got
the
chip
you
had
plenty
of
chances
why
can't
you
kill
her
you're
the
one
who
keeps
bringing
her
up
i
haven't
said
a
word
about
the
bloody
slayer
since
we
left
california
she's
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
dru
but
you're
lying
i
can
still
see
her
floating
all
around
you
laughing
why
why
won't
you
push
her
away

did
it
for
you
