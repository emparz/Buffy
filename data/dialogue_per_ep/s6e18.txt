this
guy
if
you

i'd
wager
he

give

the
staking
all

they'll
deal
in

look
on
his
face

that
time

highlighted
in
his
babylon
5
novels
right
before
he
told
his
mother

get
it
in
the
fridge

of
the
mirror

just
don't
understand
what
happened
i
do

an
idiot

have
spared
you
from

that
nightmare

something
about
what
no
no

of
an
eitheror
deal

you
want
to
get
married
someday

love
you
so
much
i'm
just
trying
to
be
honest
with
you

wonder
what
the
medal

not
handling
this
well
well
duh
all
i
want
is
for
us
to
be
together
i
love
you
i
i
wish
we
could
just
go
back
to
the
way
things
were
before
and
i
wish
you
were
never
born
i
know
this
is
all
coming
out
wrong
i
wish
you
felt
the
pain
of
a
thousand
searing
pokers
boiling
your
heart
in
its
own
juices
i
know
honey
i
totally
deserve
that
i
i
wish
you
had
tentacles
where
your
beady
eyes
should
be
i
wish
your
intestines
were
tied
in
knots
and
ripped
apart
inside
your
lousy
gut
they
are
really
right
now
does
it
hurt
god
yes
it
hurts
so
bad
it's
killing
me
anya
i
love
you
i
want
to
make
this
work
those
are
metaphor
intestines
you're
not
in
any
real
pain
what's
wrong
with
me
no
honey
it's
not
you
it's
me
that
ohh
ahn
ahn
wait
please
ahn
so
there
was
no
child
support
in
like
eleven
years
not
a
single
check
so
now
every
time
he
picks
up
a
piece
of
paper
that
isn't
a
check
for
the
child
paper
cut
oh
you
know
how
i
hate
to
toot
my
own
horn
but
now
his
hands
are
just
covered
in
all
these
tiny
little
bandages
like
a
quilt
you
know
made
of
bandages
hmm
okay
do
they
not
teach
listening
skills
in
human
world
i'm
sorry
i
know
i'm
just
distracted
what
about
this
thing
with
xander
don't
worry
you'll
figure
out
a
way
to
no
that's
just
it
i've
tried
everything
i
tried
every
curse
i
knew
nothing's
worked
wait
did
you
try
to
curse
him
yourself
yeah
i
am
the
wronged
party
here
of
course
i
you
can't
exact
justice
against
someone
on
behalf
of
yourself
silly
how
long
have
you
been
away
i
haven't
been
scorned
by
a
man
in
like
a
thousand
years
i
never
had
to
make
a
wish
for
myself
there
has
to
be
some
way
around
that
well

you
could
try
getting
someone
to
make
the
wish
for
you
i
suppose
uh
did
we
open
a
chain
are
we
the
international
house
of
something
nope
got
up
early
and
it
felt
like
a
breakfast
kind
of
morning
okay
what
kind
of
syrup
do
you
want
on
your
pancakes
syrups
have
kinds
oh
also
you
know
i
was
thinking
after
the
mall
yesterday
maybe
we
we
shouldn't
go
out
tonight
you
know
maybe
we
could
stay
in
and
uh
ow
um
you
know
get
a
pizza
or
uh
rent
a
movie
um
also
i
didn't
know
if
you
know
if
you
had
plans
this
weekend
but
i
thought
maybe
we
could
hey
buffy
i'm
gonna
be
okay
with
the
basement
thing
really
you
weren't
you
this
isn't
guilt
i
want
us
to
spend
time
okay
good
i
love
spending
time
but
i'm
cramping
your
teenage
style
no
yes
i
am
i'm
the
embarrassing
mom
who
tries
too
hard
when
did
this
happen
no
you're
not
it's
not
that
it's
just
what
if
instead
of
you
hanging
out
with
me
maybe
i
could
hang
out
with
you
why
don't
i
come
patrolling
with
you
tonight
oh
and
then
maybe
we
can
invite
over
some
strangers
and
ask
them
to
feed
you
candy
well
you
guys
went
out
patrolling
every
night
when
you
were
my
age
true
but
technically
you're
oneandahalf
see
i
thought
a
little
levity
might
but
okay
also
no
i
just
i
just
think
i
could
help
i'm
sure
you
could
but
it's
a
little
more
dangerous
than
i
had
in
mind
but
dawn
i
work
very
hard
to
keep
you
away
from
that
stuff
okay
i
don't
want
you
around
dangerous
things
that
can
kill
you
which
would
be
a
perfectly
reasonable
argument
if
my
sister
was
chosen
to
protect
the
world
from
tax
audits
but
see
my
sister
is
you
and
dangerous
things
that
want
to
kill
me
seem
to
find
me
but
you
don't
need
to
go
looking
for
them
now
eat
up
you're
gonna
be
late
for
school
okay
wait
it
was
under
her
wig
well
it
was
this
thing
it
just
came
out
from
inside
her
head
that's
disgusting
what
did
it
look
like
well
let's
put
it
this
way
if
i
wasn't
gay
before
god
and
this
was
after
the
invisible
ray
yep
okay
i'm
gone
for
a
couple
of
months
oh
did
i
tell
you
about
the
demon
eggs
see
now
now
i
know
you're
just
trying
to
make
me
jealous
so
what
no
rollicking
adventures
in
the
dorms
mm
it's
not
the
same
it's
not
like
living
with
a
house
full
of
family
or
sharing
a
room
with
someone
you
are
friends
with
hi
oh
my
god
you're
back
we've
been
so
worried
yeah
sorry
i
needed
to
you
know
i
couldn't
stay
here
not
after
everything
that
happened
no
no
no
we
we
totally
understand
but
you're
back
now
right
it's
complicated
you
know
and
there's
a
lot
to
deal
with
well
if
there's
anything
we
can
do
just
let
us
actually
um
there
is
an
eensy
something
i
could
use
a
little
help
with
you're
lesbians
so
the
hating
of
men
will
come
in
handy
let's
talk
about
xander
he
feels
awful
you
think
it's
anywhere
close
to
what
i
feel
no
but
what
if
it
were
you
dawn
what
if
all
you
dreamed
about
was
that
magical
day
the
day
when
the
one
person
you
loved
with
all
your
soul
would
promise
to
cherish
and
protect
your
heart
for
the
rest
of
his
life
but
instead
he
shatters
it
into
a
million
jagged
pieces
well
it's
it's
not
really
so
much
about
hating
the
men
we're
more
centered
around
the

girl
on
girl
action
and
men
really
like
to
watch
that
kind
of
stuff
don't
they
men
like
xander
i
don't
think
he
could
feel
any
worse
let's
test
that
theory
anya
xander's
my
friend
i
know
what
he
did
was
wrong
and
if
it
had
happened
to
me
i'd
wish
his
penis
would
explode
i
never
use
that
word
anymore
coagulate
wish
oh
wish
as
in
'i
wish
xander'
right
that
word
there's
vengeance
demons
out
there
that
are
still
active
remember
any
'i
wish'
could
totally
end
in
horrible
grossness
gimme
a
forinstance
i
don't
really
think
i
should
did
i
mention
the
whole
'left
at
the
altar'
thing
didn't
leave
that
out
did
i
no
look
i
i
know
what
he
did
was
wrong
god
if
it
happened
to
me
i
ii
it
must
have
been
torture
okay
let's
talk
about
torture
so
tell
me
more
about
wishing
xander's
brains
and
guts
would
go
blooey
i
didn't
say
that
yes
you
did
no
i
didn't
i
heard
you
i
swear
i
didn't
say
that
didn't
say
what
um
i
just
saw
you
were
back
and
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
working
off
my
debt
you
know
my
whole
stickyfingers
grabbyhands
thing
oh
right
the
mad
thieving
good
yes
there
's
much
to
do
i'm
gonna
put
you
to
work
missy
so
back
to
xander's
brains
and
guts
squish
squish
squish
guys
have
been
running
roughshod
over
you
for
years
torturing
that
perky
little
ticker
aren't
you
sick
of
it
don't
you
wish
guys
like
that
whoa
guys
there
have
only
been
four
three
three
three
guys
that's
barely
plural
and
didn't
each
of
them
rip
your
heart
out
don't
men
like
that
as
to
pick
an
example
xander
deserve
to
be
punished
well
xander
is
a
guy
so

it's
kinda
not
the
surprise
that
he
likes
to
watch
girls
why
are
we
talking
about
this
we're
comforting
me
well
ii
guess
it's
natural
for
guys
to
be
interested
in
god
what
kind
of
lesbians
are
you
if
you
love
men
so
much
go
love
men
anya
i
know
you're
hurting
but
what
xander
doesn't
deserve
to
suffer
for
what
he
did
'cause
he's
your
friend
and
i'm
not
right
i
get
it
no
that's
not
what
i'm
saying
at
all
what
he
did
was
wrong
he
knows
that
it
just
it
hurts
he
hurt
me
so
much
he
really
did
look
ii
wish
that
anya
well
congratulations
they
all
still
love
you
even
after
what
you
did
to
me
anya
wait
okay
not
not
crazy
about
that
idea
what
are
you
doing
i
have
to
go
after
her
or
in
the
land
of
the
sane
you
could
give
her
some
space
let
her
cool
down
that's
not
proactive
guy
that's
sitaroundand
watchtherestofyourlifetoturntocrap
guy
true
uh
but
at
least
crap
guy
gets
to
keep
all
of
his
appendages
and
i'm
supposed
to
what
walk
away
shouldn't
be
too
hard
it's
what
i'm
good
at
right
okay
see
that's
exactly
why
a
hearttoheart
is
probably
not
your
best
course
of
action
right
now
when
you're
both
angry
and
upset
and
what
the
hell
is
that
creepy
little
thing
doing
in
my
yard
did
willow
put
that
there
when
i
was
dead
'cause
if
i
had
known
i
would
have
crawled
out
of
the
grave
sooner
to
buffy
oh
my
god
looks
like
someone's
been
keeping
an
eye
on
all
your
ins
and
outs
what
the
who
well
now
let's
see
who's
obsessed
with
buffy
who
likes
to
hang
out
in
her
yard
and
keep
an
eye
on
her
who's
in
love
with
you
and
not
getting
any
what's
this
it's
a
camera
yeah
i
got
that
part
why
am
i
holding
it
someone
was
using
it
to
spy
on
me
on
my
house
xander
thinks
it's
you
oh
the
great
xander
thinks
so
shudder
gasp
it
must
be
true
spike
that
ponce
has
always
had
it
for
me
every
chance
he
gets
he
sticks
it
you
believe
him
don't
you
you
think
i
was
spying
on
you
you
think
i
could
do
that
because
you
don't
lie
or
cheat
or
steal
or
manipulate
i
don't
hurt
you
i
know
no
you
don't
i've
tried
to
make
it
clear
to
you
but
you
won't
see
it
something
happened
to
me
the
way
i
feel
about
you
it's
different
and
no
matter
how
hard
you
try
to
convince
yourself
it
isn't
it's
real
i
think
it
is
for
you
i
know
that's
not
what
you
want
to
hear
i'm
sorry
i
really
am
but
spike
you
have
to
move
on
you
have
to
get
over
get
out
no
they're
all
'oh
poor
xander
it
took
so
much
out
of
him
all
that
running
away
he
did'
i
just
don't
understand
what's
wrong
with
these
people
did
you
really
think
they
were
the
ones
who
would
help
you
well
but
do
you
want
retribution
anyanka
i
want
xander
good
and
cursed
then
you
know
what
you
have
to
do
get
a
wish
from
someone
who
doesn't
freaking
love
him
exactly
yeah
but
my
social
circle
is
a
little
limited
here
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
just
stumble
upon
someone
who
doesn't
give
a
fig's
ass
if
xander
gets
hurt
hey
i
need
a
thing
so
what's
your
pleasure
fresh
of
out
of
pleasure
that's
why
i'm
here
i
need
something
numbing
spell
maybe
uh
huh
hang
on
oh
my
god
spike
hates
xander
maybe
i
could
get
him
to
wish
dammit
if
only
he
were
a
woman
got
it
if
i
can
somehow
get
someone
to
wish
that
spike
were
a
woman
then
i
could
go
to
him
well
he'd
be
a
her
by
then
then
i
could
go
to
her

anyanka
there's
an
easier
way
now
i
know
you
have
this
whole
femalepower
take
back
the
night
thing
i
think
that's
cute
but
i've
been
telling
you
for
decades
men
need
a
little
vengeance
now
and
then
too
oh
maybe
this
is
a
good
chance
to
try
it
out
good
luck
with
that
tata
sorry
to
bust
up
the
little
girls'
night
out
that's
okay
i'm
ready
to
do
some
business
right
then
got
something
that'll
dull
the
ache
a
bit
actually
yes
um
giles
left
a
couple
of
supplies
here
and
i
think
this
might
help
eases
the
hurt
makes
the
sun
shine
a
little
brighter
even
makes
boring
people
seem
more
interesting
ah
here
how's
it
coming
can
you
see
who's
getting
the
camera's
signal
should
have
something
once
i
get
tapped
into
the
fiberoptic
network
we're
gonna
use
the
feedback
relay
to
uh
get
their
signal
routed
into
our
system
okay
if
it's
not
spike
and
i'm
i'm
not
saying
i
believe
him
but
if
it's
not
spike
i
think
we
already
know
who's
behind
this
makes
sense
i
want
to
find
these
guys
uncover
there
that's
it
that's
where
we
have
to
go
well
now
that
we've
found
out
where
we're
supposed
to
go
yah
so
then
this
girl
says
real
for
you
right
but
getting
back
to
xander
xander
let's
not
waste
any
more
breath
on
that
wanker
but
he
made
a
fool
of
me
and
nobody
seems
to
care
enough
to
do
anything
i
care
what
he
done
to
you
i've
never
stooped
that
low
and
i'm
an
'evil
soulless
thing'
according
to
some
people
but
shouldn't
he
pay
don't
you
wish
he
had
to
pay
in
some
horrible
way
absolutely
take
him
on
myself
if
it
wasn't
for
my
little
handicap
right
so
hypothetically
what
do
you
wish
you
could
do
to
him
you
name
it
pet
you're
the
wronged
party
something
uh
gruesome
how
'bout
hey
that's
my
blanket
well
makes
sense
it
was
your
fire
hey
hey
i
think
i've
got
something
thing
about
it
is
none
of
this
was
my
idea
i
didn't
ask
to
be
human
right
and
i
didn't
ask
for
this
bloody
chip
in
my
head
to
tell
you
the
truth

all
i
wanted
was
to
use
him
and
lose
him
i
hadn't
had
a
good
tumble
in
a
thousand
years
me
too
the
using
part
i
just
wanted
to
know
what
i
was
missing
move
on
yeah
and
he
was
all
bumpy
in
the
right
places
and
nice
to
me
she
was
so
raw
i've
never
felt
anything
like
it
next
thing
you
know
i'm
changing
to
please
him
i
care
if
he
cares
right
and
i'm
off
my
guard
happy
i'm
singing
in
the
shower
and
doing
my
sexy
dance
exactly
i
have
no
dance
talk
to
me
will
technology's
pretty
sophisticated
lots
of
booby
traps
and
firewall
stuff
but
can
you
get
us
a
location
well
hey
i'm
still
me
just
one
whoa
what
there
are
other
cameras
screw
'em
to
the
rafters
i
did
everything
for
that
man
was
it
ever
enough
never
i
was
always
going
above
and
beyond
i
saved
the
scoobies
how
many
times
and
i
can't
stand
the
lot
of
you
me
either
i
hate
us
everybody's
so
nice
nobody
says
what's
on
their
mind
you
do
that's
why
you're
the
only
one
of
them
i
wouldn't
bite
if
i
had
the
chance
really
absolutely
i
have
nothing
but
respect
for
a
woman
who
is
forthright
drusilla
was
always
straightforward
didn't
have
a
single
buggering
clue
about
what
was
going
on
in
front
of
her
but
she
was
straight
about
it
that's
a
virtue
mm
xander
didn't
think
so
he
thought
i
was
rude
that's
because
he's
one
of
them
uptight
repressed
you
think
please
it's
no
wonder
they
couldn't
deal
with
the
likes
of
you
and
me
luv
we
should
have
been
dead
hundreds
of
years
ago
and
we're
the
only
ones
who
are
really
alive
oh
my
god
the
double
meat
palace
the
bronze
my
classes
on
campus
xander's
site

they've
been
spying

been
coming
on
all
hellbent
and
mad
wanting
his
head
you

sleep
at

thinking
it
has
to
be
my
fault

it
was
just
pretending
what
if
he
never
wanted
me
the
way
i
wanted
him
ohh
i'm
sorry
now

he
would
have
to
be
more
than
just
the
git
he
is
anya
he'd
have
to
be
deaf
dumb
and
blind
not
to
want
a
woman
like
you

two
of
them
