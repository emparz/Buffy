what
is
a
cat
scan
exactly
i
don't
know
it's
some
xray
i
guess
where
do
they
get
the
cat
scan
from
i
mean
do
they
test
it
on
cats
or
or
does
the
machine
sort
of
look
like
a
cat
dawn
i'm
really
your
onestop
spot
to
shop
for
all
your
occult
needs
catchy
think
so
uhhuh
in
a
hard
to
read
sort
of
way
but
i
think
it's
great
oh
i'm
just
saying
i
think
it's
rude
i
wouldn't
call
it
rude
rudeish
rudeesque
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
when
a
person
makes
a
destroy
all
vampires
date
it's
simple
courtesy
to
wait
for
your
codestroyers
am
i
right
giles
i'm
almost
certain
you're
not
but
to
be
fair
i
wasn't
listening
oh
thethe
new
phone
book's
in
with
mr
giles'
ad
oh
nice
yay
am
i
mentioned

were
supposed
to
hook
up
with
riley
this
morning
to
take
on
a
nest
o'vamps
holed
up
in
a
tomb
so
we

captain
america
blowed
it
up
real
good
all
by
his
lone
wolf
lonesome
hmm
uh
rather
reckless
of
him
i'd
say
very
rather
all
that
aside
i
should
think
you'd
be
pleased
to
avoid
the
confrontation
that's
what
i've
been
saying
i
mean
i
for
one
didn't
want
to
start
my
day
with
a
slaughter
which
really
just
goes
to
show
how
much
i've
grown

i
could
use
your
help
researching

has
been
fruitful
trying
to
look
up
something

never
saw
and
don't
know
the
name
of

do
what
i
do
flip
through
the
pages

be
nice
if
we
knew

was
where
she's
hiding
out
no
doubt
lurking
around
some
sewer
or
condemned
church
or
ratinfested

well
she
just
had
a
cat

i
was
about
to

talk
to

the
waiting
room

oh
of
course
baby
come
on
in
uh
where's
dawn
uh
she's
with
riley
they're
watching
tv
in
the
waiting
room
excuse
me
i'm
just
gonna
check
on
the
status
of
the
or
the
or
dr
isaacs
says
i'm
lucky
there's
one
available
on
such
short
notice
some
people
wait
for
days
sometimes
weeks
mom
what
did
they
find
a
shadow
i've
got
a
shadow
somewhere
over
there
he
showed
it
to
me
but
um
they
have
to
do
a
biopsy
to
find
out
exactly
what
it
is
doctor
says
it's
too
early
to
be
concerned
right
no
concern
just
a
shadow
i
just
wish
we
knew
what
we
were
dealing
with
it
feels
like
we're
going
around
in
circles
our
circles
are
going
around
in
circles
we've
got
dizzy
circles
here
giles
ah
weeping
buddha
shoulders
your
spiritual
burden
makes
a
lovely
paperweight
too
maybe
she's
not
in
the
books
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
what
if
she's
not
a
demon
or
sorceress
or
spirit
or
whatever
these
books
cover
what
if
she's
something
else
altogether
thank
you
come
again
something
new
you
mean
something
old
so
old
it
predates
the
written
word
giles
the
dagon
sphere
you
said
that
was
created
to
repel
that
which
cannot
be
named
so
i'm
thinking
maybe
she
predates
language
itself
well
hey
if
it
means
i
don't
have
to
read
any
more
woo
and
might
i
add
a
big
hoo
if
tara's
right
then
we're
blind
there's
there's
no
way
we
can
determine
her
moves
her
habits
where
she'll
turn
up
next
oh
i
beg
your
uhhuh
i
want
these
yes
of
course
um
you
find
everything
all
right
no
problemo
that's
um
your
receipt
and

thank
you
she
could
be
anywhere
but
if
she
is
as
powerful
as
uh
buffy
says
i
imagine
it
won't
be
long
before
she
makes
herself
known
everything
went
fine
they're
moving
her
into
recovery
now
do
we
have
the
results
yet
let's
um
sit
down
over
here
for
a
minute
no
excuse
me
no
i
i
don't
mean
to
be
rude
i
just
i've
been
sitting
for
hours
i
don't
wanna
sit
i
just
tell
me
please
your
mother
has
the
term
is
lowgrade
glioma
it's
a
brain
tumor
the
clinical
name
is
oligodendroglioma
it's
in
the
left
hemisphere
of
the
cerebrum
in
your
mother's
case
the
tumor
seems
to
have
started
there
in
other
words
it
hasn't
spread
from
another
part
of
the
body
i
know
this
is
very
difficult
and
uh
because
of
the
nature
of
your
mother's
illness
unfortunately
things
may
progress
very
quickly
things
what
things
symptoms
there's
a
fair
variety
that
might
present
loss
of
vision
or
appetite
lack
of
muscle
control
uh
mood
swings
but
what
can
we
do
well
not
much
until
we
determine
if
the
tumor's
operable
which
we
are
working
on
is
there
something
that
i
i
mean
can
i
help
well
there's
some
literature
you
might
want
to
look
at
if
we
aren't
able
to
go
in
surgically
there
are
a
number
of
new
treatments
that
are
very
promising
your
mother's
prognosis
is
a
lot
better
today
than
it
would
have
been
only
a
year
ago
even
if
the
tumor's
not
operable
she
has
a
real
chance
what's
a
real
chance
nearly
one
out
of
three
patients
with
this
condition
does
just
fine
now
let
me
ask
does
your
mother's
insurance
company
require
copies
of
the
mri
and
pathology
reports
i'm
not
sure
well
just
let
me
know
as
soon
as
possible
and
i
could
use
some
information
regarding
your
mom's
lifestyle
and
home
environment
for
instance
does
she
use
a
cell
phone
uh
i
think
so
uh
yeah
she
um
sheshe
has
one
of
those
ear
things
ok
is
your
house
near
any
power
lines
chemical
plants
waste
disposal
facilities

know
maybe

he
really

a
good
doctor

mom's
in
good
hands
thank
you
it's
ben

gonna
tell
you
the
same
thing

some
air
come
back
later
on
this
evening
talk
to
the
doc
then
if
you
want
my
unsolicited
advice
of
the
day
buffy
it's
bad
i
know
i

i
have
to
do
something
do
something
yeah
like
you
know
magic
like
a
healing
spell
buffy
people
get
sick
i
don't
think
magic
that
attitude's
not
helping
i
have
to
try
okay
i
need
to
talk
to
giles
uh
will
you
do
me
a
favor
and
and
drop
dawn
off
at
school
and
tell
her
i'll
meet
her
at
the
magic
shop
in
an
hour
when
she
gets
off
of
course
whatever
you
need
me
to
do
buffy
what
do
you
want
me
to
tell
dawn
about
your
mom
tell
her
we
don't
know
anything
yet
hey
hey
hey
hey
anya
your
heys
are
startling
the
customers
andand
pretty
much
the
state
you
sold
someone
a
khul's
amulet
and
a
sobekian
bloodstone
yes
i
believe
i
did
are
you
stupid
or
something
allow
me
to
answer
that
question
with
a
firing
she's
kidding
an
we
talked
about
the
employeeemployer
vocabulary
nonos
that
was
number
five
you
never
sell
these
things
together
ever
bad
news
don't
you
know
about
the
sobekites
oh
i
do
it
was
an
ancient
egyptian
cult
heavy
into
dark
magic
and
the
khul's
amulet
wasn't
that
a
transmogrification
conduit
damn
straight
be
that
as
it
may
i
still
see
no
reason
for
concern
i
mean
thethe
sobekian
transmogrification
spells
were
lost
thousands
of
years
ago
and
besides
the
young
woman
to
whom
i
sold
them
would
have
to
have
had
enormous
power
young
woman
oh
dear
lord
what
you're
melting
oh
um
guess
i'm
not
hungry
maybe
i'm
not
making
this
any
better
no
i
just
this
is
better
i
had
my
tenth
birthday
party
here
really
mmhmm
we'd
just
moved
to
sunnydale
and
mom
rented
the
carousel
for
an
entire
hour
for
just
me
and
my
friends
except
i
hadn't
made
any
friends
yet
so
it
was
just
me
and
mom
and
buffy
riding
it
by
ourselves
over
and
over
and
over
again
for
the
whole
hour
just
so
mom
felt
like
we'd
gotten
our
money's
worth
she's
she's
not
gonna
get
better
is
she
absolutely
she
will
summers
women
are
tough
i'm
really
glad
you're
here
thanks
buffy's
glad
too
yeah
she
sure
cries
a
lot
less
with
you
than
she
did
with
angel
angel
made
her
cry
a
lot
huh
everything
with
him
was
all

eee
you
know
all
you
know
my
boyfriend's
a
vampire
crazy
crazy
every
day
was
like
the
end
of
the
world
she
doesn't
get
all
worked
up
like
that
over
you
i
think
you've
been
really
good
for
her
so
i
figured
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
mystical
cure
right
i
mean
like
a
a
potion
or
a
spell
or
something
we
have
to
look
we
can
look
i
mean
we
will
but
i
haven't
seen
anything
the
truth
is
uh
the
mystical
and
the
medical
aren't
meant
to
mix
buffy
sorry
um
the
human
mind
is
very
delicate
too
much
can
go
wrong
yeah
i've
heard
stories
about
people
trying
healing
spells
if
we
did
something
it
could
make
things
a
lot
worse
buffy
we've
done
just
about
enough
making
things
worse
for
one
day
haven't
we
why
what
do
you
mean
uh
nothing
anya
broke
a
bippity
boppity
boo
a
thing
don't
worry
about
it
i
did
not
i
didn't
break
anya
buffy
doesn't
need
to
hear
about
your
clumsiness
right
now
my
clumsiness
i
mean
that
is
so
like
me
slippery
slippery
butterfingers
what
happened
nothing
to
concern
you
uh
giles
the
uh
demon
woman
was
here
the
one
who
attacked
you
it's
no
biggie
sheshe
just
got
an
amulet
and
a
bloodstone
that
can
create
a
monster
okay
biggie
my
god
are
you
guys
okay
though
i
mean
did
no
one
got
hurt
right
oh
no
thankfully
no
uh
no
violence
to
speak
of
okay
so
that's
good

how
did
she
get
away
with
this
bad
mojo
stuff
giles
sold
it
to
her
i
i
i
i
didn't
know
it
was
her
i
mean
how
could
i
if
it's
any
consolation
i
may
have
overcharged
her
anya
figured
out
what
the
demon
lady's
up
to
yeah
a
few
thousand
years
ago
there
was
this
cult
the
temple
of
sobek
sobek
reptile
demon
sobekites
were
reptile
worshippers
just
once
i
would
like
to
run
into
a
cult
of
bunny
worshippers
great
thank
you
very
much
for
those
nightmares
sorry
anyway
their
high
priest
khul
had
great
mystic
powers
he
um
forged
an
amulet
with
transmogrifying
crystal
transmogrifying
is
changing
a
living
thing
into
a
different
kind
of
thing
we've
managed
to
decipher
the
markings
that
were
on
the
bloodstone
that
i
sold
that
she
left
with
um
cobra
she's
going
to
transmogrify
a
cobra
okay
so
she's
making
a
monster
what
for
what
does
it
do
that's
the
part

we're
