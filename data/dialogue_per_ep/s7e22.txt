well
i
guess
that
qualifies
as
happy
to
see
me
angel
what
are
you
doing—
don't
even
i
just
want
to
bask
ok
i'm
basked
what
are
you
doing
here
not
saving
the
damsel
in
distress
that's
for
sure
oh
you
know
me
not
much
with
the
damseling
got
your
share
of
distress
though
you
heard
i
got
coverage
on
the
whole
thing
it's
very
gripping
it
needs
a
third
act
you
have
to
leave
la
it's
the
first
right
the
first
evil
the
power
that
tried
to
convince
me
to
kill
myself
yeah
it's
gotten
a
little
more
ambitious
since
then
it's
raising
an
army
yeah
well
it
failed
once
and
i'm
here
to
tell
you—
are
you
ready
to
finish
this
bitch
okhow
many
times
do
i
have
to
kill
you
ballpark
figure
you
understand
nothing
you
think
you
have
power
over
me
stupid
girl
you'll
never
stop
me
you
don't
have
the
ba—
who
does
nowadays
ok
now
i'm
pissed
where
is
he
he
had
to
split
yeah
she
needs
you
real
bad
i'll
have
the
guys
go
through
that
see
if
there's
anything
new
reliable
source
not
remotely
mm
any
port
in
an
apocalypse
i
uh
brought
something
else
as
well
i
can
already
tell
you
i
have
nothing
that
goes
with
that
it's
not
for
you
splainy
i
don't
know
everything
it's
very
powerful
and
probably
very
dangerous
it
has
a
purifying
power
a
cleansing
power
possibly
scrubbing
bubbles
the
translation
is
uh—anyway
it
bestows
strength
to
the
right
person
who
wears
it
and
the
right
person
is
someone
ensouled
but
stronger
than
human
a
champion
as
in
me
or
me
no
i
don't
know
nearly
enough
about
this
to
risk
you
wearing
it
besides
you
got
that
real
cool
axething
going
for
you
so
you're
gonna
be
with
me
in
this
shoulder
to
shoulder
i'm
yours
no
no
what
no
you're
not
gonna
be
in
this
fight
why
the
hell
not
'cause
i
can't
risk
you
you
need
me
in
this
no
i
need
you
gone
why
if
i
lose
if
this
thing
gets
past
sunnydale
then
it's
days—maybe
hours—before
the
rest
of
the
world
goes
i
need
a
second
front
and
i
need
you
to
run
it
ok
that's
one
reason
what's
the
other
there
is
no
other
is
it
spike
you're
not
telling
me
something
and
his
scent
i
remember
it
pretty
well
you
vampires
did
anybody
ever
tell
you
the
whole
smelling
people
thing's
a
little
gross
is
he
your
boyfriend
is
that
your
business
you
in
love
with
him
ok
maybe
i'm
outta
line
but
this
is
kind
of
a
curve
ball
for
me
i
mean
we
are
talking
about
spike
here
it's
different
he's
different
he
has
a
soul
now
oh
well
what
that's
great
everyone's
got
a
soul
now
he'll
make
a
difference
you
know
i
started
it
the
whole
having
a
soul
before
it
was
all
the
cool
new
thing
oh
my
god
are
you
12
i'm
getting
the
brush
off
for
captain
peroxide
it
doesn't
necessarily
bring
out
the
champion
in
me
you're
not
getting
the
brush
off
are
you
just
gonna
come
here
and
go
all
dawson
on
me
every
time
i
have
a
boyfriend
aha
boyfriend
he's
not
buthe
is
in
my
heart
that'll
end
well
what
was
the
highlight
of
our
relationship
when
you
broke
up
with
me
or
when
i
killed
you
i'm
well
aware
of
my
stellar
history
with
guys
and
no
i
don't
see
fat
grandchildren
in
the
offing
with
spike
but
i
don't
think
that
really
matters
right
now
you
know
in
the
midst
of
all
this
insanity
a
couple
things
are
actually
starting
to
make
sense
and
the
guy
thing—
i
always
feared
there
was
something
wrong
with
me
you
know
because
i
couldn't
make
it
work
but
maybe
i'm
not
supposed
to
because
you're
the
slayer
because—ok
i'm
cookie
dough
i'm
not
done
baking
i'm
not
finished
becoming
whoever
the
hell
it
is
i'm
gonna
turn
out
to
be
i
make
it
through
this
and
the
next
thing
and
the
next
thing
and
maybe
one
day
i
turn
around
and
realize
i'm
ready
i'm
cookies
and
then
you
know
if
i
want
someone
to
eat—
or
enjoy
warm
delicious
cookie
me
thenthat's
fine
that'll
be
then
when
i'm
done
any
thoughts
on
who
might
enjoy—
do
i
have
to
go
with
the
cookie
analogy
i'm
not
really
thinking
that
far
ahead
that's
kind
of
the
point
i'll
go
start
working
on
the
second
front
make
sure
i
don't
have
to
use
it
angel
i
do
sometimes
think
that
far
ahead
sometimes
is
something
be
a
long
time
coming
years
if
ever
i
ain't
getting
any
older
ow
dumbass
don't
look
at
me
this
is
a
summers'
thing
it's
all
very
violent
if
you
get
killed
i'm
telling
did
you
find
out
anything
about
the
scythe
it
slices
dices
and
makes
julienne
preacher
caleb
i
cut
him
in
half
all
right
he
had
that
coming
hey
party
in
my
eye
socket
and
everyone's
invited
sometimes
i
shouldn't
say
words
sowhere's
tall
dark
and
forehead
let
me
guess
you
can
smell
him
yeah
that
and
i
also
used
my
enhanced
vampire
eyeballs
to
watch
you
kissing
him
it
wasa
hello
most
people
don't
use
their
tongues
to
say
hello
or
i
guess
they
do
but—
there
were
no
tongues
besides
he's
gone
oh
just
popped
by
for
a
quickie
then
good
good
i
haven't
had
quite
enough
jealous
vampire
crap
for
one
night
he
wears
lifts
you
know
you
know
one
of
these
days
i'm
just
gonna
put
you
2
in
a
room
and
let
you
wrestle
it
out
no
problem
at
this
end
there
could
be
oil
of
some
kind
involved
where's
the
trinket
the
whoket
the
pretty
necklace
your
sweetiebear
gave
you
the
one
with
all
the
power
i
believe
it's
mine
now
how
do
you
figure
someone
with
a
soul
but
more
than
human
angel
meant
to
wear
it
that
means
i'm
the
qualified
party
it's
volatile
we
don't
know—
you'll
be
needing
someone
strong
to
bear
it
then
you
planning
on
giving
it
to
andrew
angel
said
the
amulet
was
meant
to
be
worn
by
a
champion
been
called
a
lot
of
things
in
my
time
faith
still
has
my
room
well
you're
not
staying
here
you
can't
buy
me
off
with
shiny
beads
and
sweet
talk
you
got
angel
breath
i'm
not
gonna
just
let
you
whack
me
back
and
forth
like
a
rubber
ball
i've
got
my
pride
you
know
i
understand
clearly
you
don't
'cause
the
whole
having
my
pride
thing
was
just
a
smokescreen
oh
thank
god
i
don't
know
what
i
would
have
done
if
you'd
have
gone
up
those
stairs
pretty
ain't
it
you're
not
him
no
you
killed
him
right
and
proper
terrible
loss
this
man
was
my
good
right
arm
'course
it
don't
pain
me
too
much
don't
need
an
arm
got
an
army
an
army
of
vampires
however
will
i
fight—
every
day
our
numbers
swell
but
then
you
do
have
an
army
of
your
own
some
thirtyodd
pimplyfaced
girls
don't
know
the
pointy
end
of
a
stake
maybe
i
should
call
this
off
have
you
ever
considered
a
cool
name
i
mean
since
you're
incorporeal
and
basically
powerless
how
about
the
taunter
strikes
fear
in
the
heart—
i
will
overrun
this
earth
and
when
my
army
outnumbers
the
humans
on
this
earth
the
scales
will
tip
and
i
will
be
made
flesh
talk
on
i'm
not
afraid
of
you
then
why
aren't
you
asleep
in
your
dead
lover's
arms
'cause
he
can't
help
you
nor
faith
nor
your
friends
certainly
not
your
wannaslay
brigade
none
of
those
girlies
will
ever
know
real
power
unless
you're
dead
you
know
the
drill
into
every
generation
a
slayer
is
born
one
girl
in
all
the
world
she
alone
will
have
the
strength
and
skill
to—
there's
that
word
again
what
you
are
how
you'll
die
alone
where's
your
snappy
comeback
you're
right
hmm
not
your
best
i'm
drowning
in
footwear
weird
dream
buffy
is
something
wrong
no
yeah
i
just
realized
something
something
that
really
never
occurred
to
me
before
we're
gonna
win
what
do
you
think
that
depends
are
you
in
any
waykidding
you
don't
think
it's
a
good
idea
it's
pretty
radical
b
it's
a
lot
more
than
that
buffy
what
you
said
it—it
flies
in
the
face
of
everything
we've
ever—every
generation
has
ever
done
in
the
fight
against
evil
i
think
it's
bloody
brilliant
you
mean
that
if
you
want
my
opinion
i
really
do
whoa
hey
not
to
poop
on
the
party
here
but
i'm
the
guy
that's
gonna
have
to
pull
this
thing
off
it
is
beaucoup
d'mojo
this
goes
beyond
anything
i've
ever
done
it's
a
total
loss
of
control
and
not
in
a
nice
wholesome
my
girlfriend
has
a
pierced
tongue
kind
of
way
i
wouldn't
ask
if
i
didn't
think
you
could
do
it
i—i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
stable
enough
you
can
do
this
willow
we'll
get
the
coven
on
the
line
and
we'll
find
out
how
they
can
help
oh
pierced
tongue
dawn
needs
to
do
a
research
thing
yes
you
do
it's
cool
watcher
junior
to
the
library
i'll
go
dig
up
my
sources
quite
literally
actually
come
on
let's
go
assemble
the
cannon
fodder
that's
not
what
we're
calling
them
sweetie
not
to
their
faces
what
am
i
insensitive
i
hate
this
i
hate
being
here
i
hate
that
you
have
to
be
here
i
hate
that
there's
evil
and
that
i
was
chosen
to
fight
it
i
wish
a
whole
lot
of
the
time
that
i
hadn't
been
i
know
a
lot
of
you
wish
i
hadn't
been
either
but
this
isn't
about
wishes
this
is
about
choices
i
believe
we
can
beat
this
evil
not
when
it
comes
not
when
its
army
is
ready
now
tomorrow
morning
i'm
opening
the
seal
i'm
going
down
into
the
hellmouth
and
i'm
finishing
this
once
and
for
all
right
now
you're
asking
yourself
what
makes
this
different
what
makes
us
anything
more
than
a
bunch
of
girls
being
picked
off
one
by
one
it's
true
none
of
you
have
the
power
that
faith
and
i
do
so
here's
the
part
where
you
make
a
choice
it's
one
hell
of
a
risky
idea
buffy's
wacky
that
way
yeah
there's
one
more
vent
right
by
the
stairs
we
block
that
they
got
no
sewer
access
should
drive
them
straight
up
into
the
school
proper
that's
assuming
they
get
past
us
which
no
offense
i
am
come
on
you
gotta
have
a
little
faith
i
think
i've
had
my
share
thanks
well
i
trundled
right
into
that
one
didn't
i
look
i'm
sorry
if
it
seemed
like
i
was
blowing
you
off
the
other
day
i
was
just
trying
to
you
know
blow
you
off
yeah
you
know
what
i
figured
that
one
out
all
by
myself
it's
nothing
personal
it's
just
after
i
get
bouncy
with
a
guy
there's
not
that
much
more
i
need
that's
bleak
way
of
the
world
that's
good
to
know
'cause
for
a
second
there
i
thought
it
was
more
defensive
isolationist
slayer
crap
and
he
comes
out
swinging
faith
there's
a
whole
world
out
there
that
you
don't
even
know
about
and
a
lot
of
the
men
in
it
are
pretty
decent
guys
they'd
surprise
you
guy
looks
at
me
let's
just
say
his
priorities
shift
why
because
you're
so
hot
it's
what
it
is
yo
oh
please
i
am
so
much
prettier
than
you
are
oh
and
uh
for
the
record
our
little
encounter
didn't
exactly
change
my
world
you're
tripping
that
was
rock
'em
sock
'em
no
no
no
no
it
was—it
was—it
was
nice
enough
you
know
and
you're—you're
very
um
mm
enthused
and
i
think
with
a
little
more
experience—
dude
i
got
mad
skills
yeah
of
course
let's
finish
up
no
hell
with
that
we're
going
again
baby
you're
gonna
learn
a
little
respect
here
pal
faith—
make
me
a
deal
all
right
we
live
through
this
you
give
me
the
chance
to
surprise
you
what
would
be
the
surprise
you
do
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
right
fine
deal
good
enough
no
way
you're
prettier
than
me
a
little
bit
yeah
i
really
wish
she
hadn't
said
that
about
me
what
the
thing
buffy
said
i
think
it's
true
i'll
be
with
you
to
keep
you
grounded
yeah
well
you
might
have
to
keep
me
stabded
if
i
go
to
the
bad
place
you're
saying
i
might
have
to
kill
you
i
am
bite
me
i
will
i
mean
i
do
mean
it
the
darkest
place
i've
ever
been
this
is
what
lies
beyond
that
this
is
too
important
for
me
to—
buffy
believes
in
you
you
know
buffy
sweet
girl
not
that
bright
hey
i'm
the
first
one
to
call
her
out
when
she's
not
making
sense
in
fact
this
may
have
escaped
your
keen
notice
but
i'm
kind
of
a
brat
i've
always
sort
of
gotten
my
way
so
you're
gonna
make
it
through
this
no
matter
how
dark
it
gets
because
now
you're
my
way
i
better
go
over
this
again
i'm—i'm—i'm
all
turned
around

here
by
the
pillar

me
over
by

what
do
you
guys
want
to
do
tomorrow
nothing
strenuous
well
minigolf
is
always
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
i
think
we
can
do
better
than
that
i
was
thinking
about
shopping
as
per
usual
oh
there's
an
arden
b
in
the
new
mall
i
could
use
a
few
items
well
now
aren't
we
gonna
discuss
this
save
the
world
to
go
to
the
mall
i'm
having
a
wicked
shoe
craving
aren't
you
on
the
patch
those
never
work
here
i
am
invisible
to
the
eye
see
i
need
a
new
look
it's
this
whole
eye
patch
thing
oh
you
could
go
with
full
black
secret
agent
look
or
the
puffy
shirt
pirate
slash—
the
earth
is
definitely
doomed
you
first
b
they
should
be
in
place
ok
magic
time
you
ready
to
heh
heh
kill
me
starting
to
be
good
fun
great
brace
yourself
come
on
red
make
it
happen
not
to
be
a
buzzkill
love
but
my
fabulous
accessory
isn't
exactly
tingling
with
power
i'm
not
worried
i'm
getting
zero
juice
here
and
i
look
like
elizabeth
taylor
cheer
up
liz
willow's
big
spell
doesn't
work
it
won't
matter
what
you
wear
i'm
not
worried
i'm
not
worried
really
'cause
i'm
flashing
back
to
xander's
whole
bathroom
speech
buffy—
i'm
not
worriedas
long
as
willow
can
work
her
spell
before
they—
see
us
willow
ohmygoddess
so
here's
the
part
where
you
make
a
choice
what
if
you
could
have
that
powernow
in
every
generation
one
slayer
is
born
because
a
bunch
of
men
who
died
thousands
of
years
ago
made
up
that
rule
they
were
powerful
men
this
woman
is
more
powerful
than
all
of
them
combined
so
i
say
we
change
the
rule
i
say
my
power
should
be
our
power
tomorrow
willow
will
use
the
essence
of
the
scythe
to
change
our
destiny
these
guys
are
dust
willow
youare
a
goddess
and
you're
a
slayer
get
this
to
buffy
ha
that
was
nifty
buffy
catch
i
could
get
used
to
this
i
think
they're
coming
oh
god
i'm
terrified
i
didn't
think
i
mean
i—
i
just
figured
you'd
be
terrified
and
i
would
be
sarcastic
about
it
picture
happy
things
a
lake
candy
canes
bunnies
bunnies
floppy
hoppy
bunnies
i
have
swimmer's
ear
buffy
whatever
this
thing
does
i
think
it's—
keep
the
line
together
drive
them
to
the
edge
we
can't
let
them
do—
buffy
hold
the
line
we
call
that
the
greenhouse
effect
very
dangerous—
rona
oh

ow
mommy

mortal
wound

a
nice
trick

came
pretty
close
to
smacking
me

want
you

get
out
of
my
face
