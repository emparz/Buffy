'are
you
a
people
person
or
do
you
prefer
keeping
your
own
company'
well
what
if
i'm
a
people
person
who
keeps
his
own
company
by
default
so
mark
'none
of
the
above'
well
there
are
no
boxes
for
'none
of
the
above'
that
would
introduce
too
many
variables
into
their
mushroom
head
numbercrunching
little
world
i'm
sensing
bitterness
no
it's
just
these
people
can't
tell
from
one
multiplechoice
test
what
we're
gonna
be
doing
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
it's
ridiculous
i'm
kinda
curious
to
find
out
what
sort
of
career
i
could
have
what
and
suck
all
the
spontaneity
out
of
being
young
and
stupid
i'd
rather
live
in
the
dark
you're
not
gonna
be
young
forever
yes
but
i'll
always
be
stupid
okay
let's
not
all
rush
to
disagree
you're
not
stupid
'i
aspire
to
help
my
fellow
man'
check
as
long
as
he's
not
smelly
dirty
or
something
gross
cordelia
chase
always
ready
to
give
a
helping
hand
to
the
rich
and
the
pretty
which
lucky
me
excludes
you
twice
is
murder
always
a
crime
do
i
like
shrubs
that's
between
you
and
your
god
what'd
you
put
i
came
down
on
the
side
of
shrubs
go
with
shrubs
okay
uhhh
i
shouldn't
even
be
bothering
with
this
it's
all
mootville
for
me
no
matter
what
my
aptitude
test
says
we
already
know
my
deal
yup
high
risk
subminimum
wage
pointy
wooden
things
then
why
are
you
even
taking
the
test
it's
principal
snyder's
hoop
of
the
week
he's
not
happy
unless
i'm
jumping
believe
me
i
would
not
be
here
otherwise
you're
not
even
a
teensy
weensy
bit
curious
about
what
kinda
career
you
could've
had
i
mean
if
you
weren't
already
the
slayer
and
all
do
the
words
'sealed
in
fate'
ring
any
bells
for
you
will
why
go
there
y'know
with
that
kind
of
attitude
you
could've
had
a
bright
future
as
an
employee
at
the
dmv
i'm
sorry
it's
just
unless
hell
freezes
over
and
every
vamp
in
sunnydale
puts
in
for
early
retirement
i'd
say
my
future
is
pretty
much
a
nonissue
read
it
again

i'm
not
sure
it
could
be
uh

about

do
you

um
crossing
guard
maybe
but
prison
guard
they
just
put
up
the
assignments
for
the
career
fair
and
according
to
my
test
results
i
can
look
forward
to
being
gainfully
employed
in
the
growing
field
of
corrections
well
at
least
you'll
be
on
the
right
side
of
the
bars
ha
ha
ha
ha
laugh
now
missy
they
assigned
you
to
the
booth
for
law
enforcement
professionals
as
in
police
as
in
polyester
doughnuts
and
brutality
but
doughnuts
well
i'll
just
jump
off
that
bridge
when
i
come
to
it
first
i
have
to
deal
with
giles
he's
on
this
tony
robbins
hyperefficiency
kick
expects
me
to
check
in
every
day
after
homeroom
police
you
didn't
check
to
see
which
seminar
i
was
assigned
to
did
you
i
did
and
you
weren't
i
wasn't
what
on
the
list
but
i
handed
in
my
test
i
used
a
number
two
pencil
then
i
guess
you
musta
passed
it's
not
the
kinda
test
you
pass
or
fail
your
name
wasn't
up
there
will
ah
buffy
thank
you
i've
been
uh
indexing
the
watcher
diaries
covering
the
last
couple
of
centuries
you
would
be
amazed
at
how
numbingly
pompous
and
longwinded
some
of
these
watchers
were
color
me
stunned
so
uh
i
trust
last
night's
patrol
was
fruitful
semi
mm
i
caught
one
out
of
two
vamps
after
they
stole
something
from
this
jumbo
mausoleum
they
were
stealing
yeah
they
had
tools
flashlights
whole
nine
yards
what
does
that
mean
anyway
'whole
nine
yards'
nine
yards
of
what
now
it's
gonna
bug
me
all
day
giles
you're
in
pace
mode
what
gives
um
this
vampire
who
escaped
did
you
see
what
he
took
no
but
i
could
take
a
guess
and
say
it
was
something
old
you
made
no
effort
to
find
out
what
was
taken
have
a
cow
giles
i
just
figured
it
was
your
everyday
vamp
hijinks
well
what
if
it
wasn't
this
could
be
very
serious
i
mean
i
iif
you'd
made
an
effort
to
uh
to
be
more
thorough
in
your
observations
y'know
if
you
don't
like
the
way
i'm
doing
my
job
why
don't
you
find
somebody
else
oh
that's
right
there
can
only
be
one
as
long
as
i'm
alive
there
is
no
one
else
well
there
you
go
i
don't
have
to
be
the
slayer
i
could
be
dead
that
wasn't
terribly
funny
you
notice
i
don't
laugh
wouldn't
be
much
of
a
change
either
way
i'm
bored
constricted
i
never
get
to
shop
and
my
hair
and
fingernails
still
continue
to
grow
so
really
when
you
think
about
it
what's
the
diff
do
we
have
to
be
introspective
now
our
only
concern
is
to
discover
what
was
stolen
from
that
mausoleum
last
night
this
is
it
then
it
hums
i
can
hear
it
once
you're
well
again
we'll
have
a
coronation
down
main
street
and
invite
everyone
and
drink
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
what
about
the
slayer
she
almost
blew
the
whole
thing
for
us
she's
trouble
you
don't
say
trouble
spike
we
gotta
do
something
we'll
never
complete
your
cure
with
that
bitch
breathing
down
our
necks
i
need
to
bring
in
the
big
guns
they'll
take
care
of
her
once
and
for
all
big
guns
the
order
of
taraka
the
bounty
hunters
they're
coming
to
my
party
three
of
them
uh
yes
but
the
order
of
taraka
i
mean
isn't
that
overkill
no
i
think
it's
just
enough
kill
willow
what
are
you
doing
here
fly
be
free
little
bird
you
defy
category
i'm
looking
for
buffy
oh

an
hour

kind
of
field
trip

inspired

leadership
i'm
thinking
principal
school
i
wanna
walk
in
your
shoes

your
actual
shoes

course
because
you're
a
tiny

the
small
sense
of
course

done
now
where
is
she
who
you
know
who
you
mean
buffy
i
just
saw
her
and
don't
feed
me
that
'i
just
saw
her
a
minute
ago
she's
around
here
somewhere'
story
but
i
did
just
see
her
a
minute
ago
and
she
is
around
for
what
it's
worth
it's
worth
nothing
harris
whatever
comes
out
of
your
mouth
is
a
meaningless
waste
of
breath
an
airborne
toxic
event
well
i'm
glad
you
feel
comfortable
enough
to
be
so
honest
with
me
and
i
can
only
hope
that
one
day
i'm
in
the
position
to
be
that
honest
with
you
fascinating
well
love
to
stay
and
chat
but
i
got
an
appointment
with
the
warden
on
standard
riot
procedure
ciao

ya
willow
rosenberg
come
with
us
please
excuse
me
let's
walk
try
the
canape'
it's
excellent
what
is
all
this
you've
been
selected
to
meet
with
mr
mccarthy
head
recruiter
for
the
world's
leading
software
concern
the
jet
was
delayed
by
fog
at
seatac

minute

yourself
comfortable
but
i
didn't
even
get
my
test
back
the
test
was
irrelevant
we've
been
tracking
you
for
some
time
is
that
a
good
thing
i
would
think
so
we're
extremely
selective
in
fact
only
one
other
sunnydale
student
met
our
criteria
canape'
buffy
slow
down
please
giles
we
have
work
to
do
remember
get
with
the
program
you're
behaving
remarkably
imimmaturely
you
know
why
i
am
immature
i'm
a
teen
i
have
yet
to
mature
i
was
simply
offering
some
constructive
criticism
no
you
were
harsh
god
you
act
like
i
picked
this
gig
but
remember
i'm
the
picked
what
you
have
is
more
than
a
gig
it's
a
sacred
duty
which
shouldn't
prevent
you
from
ee
eventually
procuring
some
more
gainful
ffform
of
employment
uhuhuh
such
as
i
did
uh
giles
it's
one
thing
to
be
a
watcher
and
a
librarian
they
go
together
like
chicken
and
another
chicken
or
two
chickens
or
something
you
know
what
i'm
saying
the
point
is
no
one
blinks
an
eye
if
you
want
to
spend
all
your
days
with
books
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
carve
stakes
for
a
nursery
um
point
taken
i
must
however
admit
ii've
never
really
well
now
there's
a
thought
have
you
ever
considered
law
enforcement
what
oh
may
i
be
my
guest
it's
a
reliquary
used
to
house
items
of
religious
significance
most
commonly
a
finger
or
some
other
body
part
from
a
saint
note
to
self
religion
freaky
du
lac
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
hate
when
you
say
that
josephus
du
lac
was
buried
here
he
belonged
to
a
religious
sect
that
was
excommunicated
by
the
vatican
at
the
turn
of
the
century
excommunicated
and
sent
to
sunnydale
there's
a
guy
big
with
the
sinning
you
remember
the
book
that
was
stolen
from
the
library
by
a
vampire
a
few
weeks
ago
yeah
it
was
written
by
du
lac
damn
it
i
let
it
slip
my
mind
with
all
the
excitement
i'm
guessing
it
wasn't
a
'taste
of
the
vatican'
cookbook
no
the
uh
book
was
said
to
contain
rituals
and
spells
that
reap
unspeakable
evil
however
it
was
written
in
archaic
latin
so
that
nobody
but
the
sect
members
could
understand
it
so
everything's
cool
then
it's
not
first
the
book
was
taken
from
the
library
and
now
the
vampires
have
stolen
something
from
du
lac's
tomb
you
think
they
figured
out
how
to
read
the
book
something's
coming
buffy
and
whatever
it
is
i
can
guarantee
it's
not
good
bus
219
continuing
service
to
los
angeles
now
arriving
in
sunnydale
at
the
west
gate
mrs
kalish
yes
hello
i'm
norman
pfister
with
blush
beautiful
skin
care
i'm
not
selling
anything
so
i'm
not
asking
you
to
buy
just
to
accept
a
few
free
samples
free
absolutely
what
the
hell
hey
you're
not
supposed
to
be
in
here
hey
c'mon
so
giles
is
sure
that
the
vampire
who
stole
his
book
is
connected
to
the
one
you
slayed
last
night
or
is
it
slew
both
are
correct
and
yes
i'm
sure
du
lac
was
both
a
a
a
theologian
and
a
mathematician
this
article
describes
an
invention
of
his
which
he
called
'the
du
lac
cross'
so
why
go
to
all
the
trouble
of
inventing
something
and
then
giving
it
a
weak
name
like
that
i
mean
i'da
gone
with
'the
crosso
matic'
or
uh
'the
amazing
mr
cross'
the
cross
was
more
than
a
mere
symbol
it
was
used
to
understand
certain
mystical
texts
to
uh
decipher
hidden
meanings
and
so
forth
so
you're
saying
these
vampires
went
to
all
this
hassle
for
your
basic
decoder
ring
uh
actually
yes
i
i
suppose
i
am
according
to
this
du
lac
destroyed
every
cross
except
the
one
buried
with
him
why
destroy
your
own
work
perhaps
he
feared
what
might
happen
if
it
fell
into
the
wrong
hands
a
fear
we'll
soon
get
to
experience
for
ourselves
up
close
and
personal
uunless
we
can
preempt
their
plans
how
uh
by
learning
what's
in
the
book
before
they
do
which
means
we
can
expect
to
be
here
later
tonight
goody
research
party
will
you
need
a
life
in
the
worst
way
speaking
of
i
really
have
to
bail
but
i
promise
i'll
be
back
bright
and
early
tomorrow
and
ready
to
slay
this
is
a
matter
of
some
urgency
buffy
i
realize
that
well
you
have
to
admit
i
kinda
lack
in
the
book
area
i
mean
you
guys
are
the
brains
i'd
only
be
here
for
moral
support
anyway
that's
untrue
buffy
you
totally
contribute
you
go
for
snacks
she
should
go
yy'know
gather
her
strength
perhaps
you're
right
there
may
be
fierce
battles
ahead
but
hohos
are
a
vital
part
of
my
cognitive
process
sorry
xand
someplace
i
have
to
be
buffy
he's
passing
under
our
feet
right
now
no
worries
we're
close
to
decoding
the
manuscript
we
just
need
a
bit
more
time
time
is
ours
it
brings
the
slayer
closer
to
them
the
hellmouth
presents
dead
guys
on
ice
not
exactly
the
evening
we
were
aiming
for
you're
in
danger
you
know
what
the
ring
means
i
just
killed
a
super
bowl
champ
i'm
serious
you
should
go
home
and
wait
until
you
hear
from
me
are
you
okay
what
about
you
that
cut
forget
about
me
this
is
bad
buffy
we
gotta
get
you
outta
here
what
you
mean
hide
let's
just
get
you
someplace
safe
no
your
eye
hey
don't
be
a
baby
i'm
not
gonna
hurt
you
it's
not
that
i
what
you
shouldn't
have
to
touch
me
when
i'm
like
this
oh
i
didn't
even
notice
this
guy
was
hardcore
giles
and
angel
was
powerfreaked
by
that
ring
i'm
afraid
he
was
not
overreacting
this
ring
is
worn
only
by
members
of
the
order
of
taraka
it's
a
society
of
deadly
assassins
dating
back
to
king
solomon
and
didn't
they
beat
the
elks
this
year
in
the
sunnydale
adult
bowling
league
championships
their
credo
is
to
sow
discord
and
kill
the
unwary
bowling
is
a
vicious
game
that's
enough
xander
sorry
it's
just
not
the
time
for
jokes
i
need
to
think
these
assassins
why
are
they
after
me
'cause
you're
the
scourge
of
the
underworld
i
haven't
been
that
scourgey
lately
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
i
think
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
find
a
secure
location
somewhere
out
of
the
way
you
can
go
until
we
decide
on
the
best
course
of
action
okay
now
you
and
angel
have
both
said
to
head
for
the
hills
are
you
saying
i
can't
handle
this
that
i'm
not
strong
enough
to
fight
these
people
they're
a
breed
apart
buffy
uunlike
vampires
they
have
no
earthly
desires
but
to
collect
their
bounty
they
find
a
target
and
uh
they
eliminate
it
you
can
kill
as
many
of
them
as
you
like
it
won't
make
any
difference
where
there's
one
there
will
be
another
and
another
they
won't
stop
coming
until
the
job
is
done
each
one
of
them
works
alone
his
own
way
some
are
human
some
aare
not
yyou
won't
know
who
they
are
until
they
strike
try
it
try
what
uh
ii'm
sorry
still
not
clear
what
i'm
supposed
to
try
nothing
god
i'm
sorry
i
that
is
a
tense
person
i
wish
there
was
more
we
could
do
we're
doing
all
that
we
can
the
only
course
of
action
is
to
try
and
find
out
what
was
in
that
stolen
book
i've
never
seen
buffy
like
that
she
just
took
off
well
she
didn't
go
home
i
let
the
phone
ring
a
few
hundred
times
before
i
remembered
her
mom
is
out
of
town
well
maybe
buffy
unplugged
the
phone
no
it's
a
statistical
impossibility
for
a
sixteenyearold
girl
to
unplug
her
phone
well
perhaps
my
words
of
caution
were
a
little
too
alarming
ya
think
it's
good
that
she
took
you
seriously
giles
i
just
wish
we
knew
where
she
was
angel
we're
closed
can't
you
read
the
sign
oh
uh
hey
angel
i
didn't
recognize
you
in
the
dark
there
what
uh
what
can
i
do
for
you
tonight
i
need
some
information
yeah
man
that's
too
bad
'cause
i'm
stayin'
away
from
that
whole
scene

well
riright
a
right
away

get
cordelia

beyond

found
something
finally
you
did
ii
found
aa
description
of
the
missing
du
lac
manuscript
it's
a
ritual
willow
now
ii
uh
i
haven't
managed
to
decipher
the
exact
details
but
ii
i
believe
the
purpose
is
to
restore
a
weak
and
sick
vampire
back
to
full
health
a
vampire
like
drusilla
exactly
by
george
i
think
he's
got
it
the
key
to
your
cure
ducks
the
missing
bloody
link
it
was
right
right
in
front
of
us
the
whole
time
i
can't
even
believe
you
you
dragged
me
out
of
bed
for
a
ride
what
am
i
mass
transportation
that's
what
a
lot
of
the
guys
say
but
it's
just
locker
room
talk
i
wouldn't
pay
it
any
mind
oh
great
so
now
i'm
your
taxi
and
your
punching
bag
i
like
to
think
of
you
more
as
my
witless
foil
but
have
it
your
way
buffy
c'mon
cordelia
you
wanna
be
a
member
of
the
scooby
gang
you
gotta
be
willing
to
be
inconvenienced
every
now
and
then
oh
right
'cause
i
lie
awake
at
night
hoping
you
tweakos
will
be
my
best
friends
and
that
my
first
husband
will
be
a
balding
demented
homeless
man
buffy
could
be
in
trouble
and
what
if
she
is
exactly
what
are
you
gonna
do
about
it
in
case
you
haven't
noticed
you're
the
lameness
and
she's
the
super
chick
or
whatever
well
at
least
i'm
the
lameness
who
cares

is
more
than
i
can
say
about
you
