now
i
get
warren
being
the
supervillainy
type
but
i
thought
jonathan
completely
learned
that
lesson
i
never
even
heard
of
this
other
guy
you
should
have
seen
their
headquarters
it
was
like
the
nerd
natural
habitat
well
if
we
know
where
they
are
shouldn't
we
do
something
we
tried
buffy
was
gonna
go
in
there
and
bust
them
on
the
spot
i'm
sensing
a
'not
so
completely'
willow
yeah
well
she
went
in
and
then
anya
speaking
of
buffy
isn't
she
ready
she's
gonna
be
late
for
her
first
day
hey
respect
the
narrative
flow
much
please
continue
the
story
of
failure
so
buffy
went
in
but
they'd
cleared
out
and
she
brought
back
the
stuff
that
they
left
spell
books
some
parchments
a
couple
of
rare
things
charmed
objects
and
a
conjurer's
harp
aand
they
had
other
stuff
you
know
razor
scooters
and
pictures
of
the
vulcan
woman
on
enterprise
xander
ooh
i
mean
nerds
okay
see
this
is
why
demons
are
better
than
people
interesting
turn
when
i
was
a
vengeance
demon
i
caused
pain
and
mayhem
certainly
but
i
put
in
a
full
day's
work
doing
it
and
i
got
compensated
appropriately
welcome
to
today's
episode
of
'go
money
go'
i
hear
it
daily
yep
for
the
rest
of
your
life
but
supervillains
want
reward
without
labor
to
make
things
come
easy
it's
wrong
without
labor
there
can
be
no
payment
and
vice
versa
the
country
cannot
progress
the
workers
are
the
tools
that
shape
america
good
to
know
i
was
kinda
feelin'
like
a
tool
and
now
i
know
why
you've
seen
us
in
your
city
or
small
town
across
the
american
west
you've
ordered
our
delicious
food
from
our
happy
employees
but
now
you're
seeing
it
all
from
a
different
way
you're
seeing
it
from
behind
the
counter
because
you've
just
become
part
of
the
doublemeat
experience
i'm
part
of
it
i'm
part
of
it
i'm
a
part
of
it
too
this
cow
and
this
chicken
don't
know
it
yet
but
they're
destined
to
become
part
of
it
as
well
so
what
happens
when
a
cow
and
a
chicken
come
together
why
that's
a
doublemeat
medley
let's
take
a
look
now
at
the
process
of
harvesting
these
two
special
meats
holy
crap
washing
your
hands
thoroughly
after
each
visit
to
the
restroom
follow
these
rules
and
you'll
be
a
happy
part
of
the
doublemeat
family
for
a
long
time
interesting
isn't
it
oh
yes
like
how
the
cow
and
the
chicken
come
together
even
though
they've
never
met
it's
like
sleepless
in
seattle
if
if
meg
and
tom
were
like
minced
i'm
manny
the
manager
it's
not
a
joke
it's
just
my
name
right
yyou
mentioned
that
a
couple
of
times
when
i
filled
out
the
application
why
do
you
want
to
work
here
buffy
you
seem
like
a
sharp
young
woman
and
there
are
a
lot
of
other
jobs
well
ii
kinda
need
money
pretty
quickly
like
today
and
and
so
i
didn't
want
to
go
through
a
lengthy
interview
process
and
i
figured
this
was
probably
the
fastest
way
to
because
i
wanted
to
be
part
of
the
doublemeat
experience
come
on
let's
take
a
tour
philip
timothy
this
is
buffy
she's
going
to
work
the
counter
hi
what
happened
to
the
other
one
catherine
emily
yeah
she's
gone
what
happened
whatever
always
happens
you
can
use
this
one
uh
there's
there's
someone's
stuff
in
there
they
must
have
left
it
you
can
toss
it
or
keep
what
you
want
sure
they're
not
coming
back
we
have
a
lot
of
turnover
here

they
gonna
do
something
they're
solid

their
example
and
you
won't
go
wrong
they're
lifers
lifers
in
it
for
life
like
me
you
wanna
get
something
out
of
this
buffy

do
the
same

ten
years

be
where
i
am

medley
meal

pure
beefy

early
this
morning

pull
his
card
well
i'm
i'm
sure
you
know
he's
just
late
he
didn't

was
leaving
i'm
moving
timothy
to
counter
you're
on
grill
me
i've
been
watching
you
bbut
ii
don't

is
the
last
day
you'll
ever
be
able
to
say
that
you
put
the
beef
on
the
grill
you
hit
the
button
then
it
beeps
you
flip
the
beef
hit
the
other
button
then
it
beeps
you
put
it
on
the
bun
there's
not
a
button
for
that
repeat
until
insane
it
eliminates
variation
every
burger
at
every
doublemeat
palace
is
the
same
people
don't
like
variation
got
it
variety
is
the
spice
of
bad
mm
so
what's
the
secret
ingredient
it's
a
meat
process
well
what
does
that
mean
it's
a
process
they
do
it
to
the
meat
but
what
is
it
it's
just
the
name
of
the
process
oh

whose
is
it
i
don't

might
be
this
guy
named
gary
the
only
one
in
the
whole
place
who
didn't
seem
all
braindead
he
didn't
show
up
this
morning
except
now
i
think
he
was
there
the
whole
time
as
the
secret
ingredient
we
need
to
analyze
that
burger
we
need
to
find
out
if
it
used
to
be
people
what
people
xander
you
ate
the
burger
well
first
you
say
it's
cat
then
you
come
in
and
hand
me
a
burger
blah
blah
blah
five
minutes
later
'oh
and
by
the
way
it
happens
to
be
hot
delicious
human
flesh'
i
needed
that
burger
to
analyze
it
now
i'm
gonna
have
to
get
another
one
that's
your
problem
with
this
scenario
you
getting
seconds
late
late
sorry
i
i
was
reading
for
school
well
highlighting
anyway
anyway
late
yeah
you
just
missed
the
gary
burger
what
are
we
doing
let's
jump
right
in
did
xander
say
something
about
food
you
wouldn't
want
any
apparently
the
doublemeat
medley
is
people
whoa
bad
i
bet
it's
not
even
just
this
one
time
or
even
this
one
town
there
are
doublemeat
palaces
all
over
california
i've
eaten
there
a
lot
well
everyone
has
they've
got
the
perfect
deal
everyone
expects
high
turnover
of
the
employees
they
get
the
meat
for
nothing
and

and
they
have
us
disposing
of
the
bodies
how
sick
is
that
we
need
to
bring
down
the
whole
corporation
will
xander
ate
the
burger
is
there
any
way
for
sure
to
figure
out
what
it
was
well
yeah
i
can
start
analyzing
it
with
science
not
i
can
use
science
you
ate
it
um
we
have
the
wrapper
there's
little
scribbles
of
meat
on
the
wrapper
okay
good
you
guys
get
working
on
that
it's
after
closing
so
i'm
gonna
go
there
and
see
what
i
can
find
out
cool
you
go
we'll
be
good
are
you
okay
i'm
just
worried
about
buffy
she
could
be
walking
into
anything
manny
ohh
manny
guess
you
really
were
a
lifer
don't
need
magic
don't
need
it
don't
need
it
my
friend
janice
her
sister's
a
lawyer
you
think
i
should
sue
over
the
burger
that's
interesting
no
i
just
mean
buffy's
never
gonna
be
a
lawyer
or
a
doctor
anything
big
she's
a
slayer
she
saves
the
whole
world
that's
way
bigger
but
that
means
she's
gonna
have
like
crap
jobs
her
entire
life
right
minimum
wage
stuff
i
mean
i
could
still
grow
up
to
be
anything
but
for
her
this
is
it
okay
but
maybe
you'll
be
a
lawyer
or
a
doctor
and
you
can
use
all
your
money
to
support
your
deadbeat
sister
oh
that's
terrifically
better
thanks
hey
guys
ii
think
i've
got
it
good
job
will
those
aren't
like
potions
are
they
no
no
potions
it's
not
magic
it's
chemistry
you
can
tell
by
how
damn
slow
it
is
i
made
a
solution
that
reacts
to
the
proteins
in
human
blood
so
we're
pretty
close
to
knowing
for
certain
i'm
here
i'm
here
we're
doing
chemistry
oh
so
sorry
i
hurried
hey
did
your
friend
have
a
good
time
and
then
leave
she's
gone
so
ahn
the
way
she
looked
with
the
face
that
wasn't
what
you
used
to
look
like
was
it
is
there
something
wrong
with
that
i
mean
did
you
think
she
was
unattractive
okay
is
there
any
answer
to
that
question
that
won't
make
you
nuts
halfrek
was
always
considered
to
be
a
great
beauty
well
hon
she
was
a
little
there
was
some
veinyness
hold
this
okay
if
the
solution
reacts
to
the
proteins
then
i'll
be
able
to
see
it
i
mean
i'll
be
able
to
look
through
the
microscope
and
and
then
see
it
it's
not
like
you're
so
perfect
either
what
with
your
strangely
large
upper
arms
and
your
tendency
to
criticize
huh
what
do
you
see
there's
no
reaction
oh
god
no
no
reaction
which
means
it's
not
human
it's
not
human
it's
not
human
well
is
it
demony
i
mean
maybe
someone's
you
know
killing
demons
and
using
them
as
a
cheap
source
of
meat
i
mean
we've
all
heard
of
that
and
by
the
way
i'm
opposed
to
using
demon
meat
no
matter
how
much
money
it
saves
does
that
surprise
you
again
i
say
'huh'
willow
no
i'm
not
sure
what
i'm
seeing
cellulose
there's
something
weird
here
scalp
wig
wig
lady
oh
dear
wig
lady
is
that
what
they
call
me
i
don't
care
for
that
i
mean
i
have
to
do
something
to
hide
this
it's
paralyzing
don't
try
to
move
dear
you
really
can't
much
the
paralysis
spreads
upward
by
the
way
you
may
want
to
flail
your
arms
a
bit
while
you
still
can
did
i
tell
you
you're
my
favorite
doublemeat
workers
you're
all
so
full
of
doublemeat
burgers
and
you
just
slide
down
so
smooth
oh
i
just
love
the
paralysis

means
i
can
eat
you
slowly
i
know
you're
under
there
buffy

you
in
there
i
can't
see
you
inside

a
genuine
blast

on
that
was
a
sweet
spell
that
was
like
a
trip
to
disneyland
without
the
lines
you
don't
get
it
what
you
did
to
me
was
wrong
do
you
have
any
idea
how
much
harder
that
makes
just
everything
you
know
what
i
notice
you're
not
denying
that
you
had
fun
shut
up
oh
yeah
sharp
argument
you
got
there
were
you
on
the
debate
team
i
forget
i
forgot
a
lot
while
you
were
failing
to
make
me
be
not
a
rat
amy
if
you
really
are
my
friend
you
better
stay
away
from
me
and

away
from
me

me
in
when

his
disappearing
act

happen
a
lot
around

buffy
summers
i
heard
about

a
big
scene
oh

practical
jokes

really
right
for
the
workplace
i
so
get
that
now
anyway
i
just
wanted
to
return
my
uniform
oh
most
people
don't
even
bother
the
doublemeat
medley
is
vegetables
how
do
you
know
that
so
i
guess
it's
true
um
close
the
door
have
a
seat
it's
a
formed
and
texturized
vegetablebased
meatlike
product
suitable
for
grinding
it's
blended
with
large
amounts
of
rendered
beef
fat
for
flavor
wait
the
secret
ingredient
in
the
beef
is
beef
buffy
you
know
something
powerful
here
do
you
understand
that
the
doublemeat
reputation
is
built
on
a
foundation
of
well
meat
you
can't
spread
this
around
i
get
that
it's
a
valuable
secret
isn't
it
is
there
something
you
want
i
really
need
money
you
want
money
