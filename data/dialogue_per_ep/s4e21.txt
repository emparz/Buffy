riley
riley
your
thoughts
are
troubled
in
turmoil
i
understand
brother
we
have
a
lot
to
discuss
speak
what
have
you
done
to
me
nothing
it
was
mother
yourprofessor
walsh
she
implanted
the
behavior
modifier
a
chip
in
my
head
she
really
did
it
actually
the
chip
is
here
tied
directly
into
your
central
nervous
system
through
your
thoracic
nerve
this
is
phase
one
of
your
preparation
it
lay
dormant
until
the
time
came
i
simply
activated
it
brother
stop
calling
me
that
i'm
not
your
brother
you're
a
botched
science
experiment
i'm
a
human
being
who's
gonna
do
everything
in
his
power
to
adam
sit
you
have
no
power
not
yet
once
you
forget
your
old
life
and
embrace
your
destiny
as
i
have
you
will
know
power
you've
never
dreamed
of
i
think
you're
going
to
like
it
humans
claim
to
old
ways
and
ancient
feuds
and
they're
hopeless
with
technology
unworthy
not
really
wanting
a
lecture
right
now
disappointed
by
demonkind
we
turned
to
humans
smart
adaptive
but
emotional
and
weak
blind
there's
imperfection
everywhere
something
must
be
done
who
will
deliver
us
mother
she
saw
our
future
yours
and
mine
she
saw
that
you
were
necessary
she
saw
the
role
you
will
play
by
my
side
stand
up
you
see
we
are
brothers
after
all
it
warms
the
cockles
of
my
nonbeating
heart
seeing
you
lads
together
i
didn't
send
for
you
spike
yeah
welli'm
not
much
the
beingsentfor
type
i'm
much
more
the
i
did
my
part
now
get
this
chip
out
of
my
head
kind
of
guy
slightly
stiffer
than
usual
subtle
but
i
like
it
what's
with
him
i
activated
his
chip
oh
so
it's
chips
all
around
is
it
someone
must've
bought
the
partypack
you
get
yours
removed
when
the
slayer
is
where
i
want
her
she's
separated
from
her
friends
they
want
nothing
to
do
with
her
she's
all
alone
that's
how
i
want
her
where
i
want
her
is
down
in
the
initiative
she
will
ensure
that
as
many
demons
die
as
humans
she
will
achieve
maximum
carnage
before
she's
too
weak
to
go
on
no
you
can't
stop
talking
right
the
initiative
but
getting
her
therethat's
what
the
bleeding
disks
are
for
isn't
it
our
little
witch
gives
her
the
info
and
popalice
heads
back
down
the
rabbit
hole
the
witch
uh
willow
about
so
high
perky
good
with
math
natural
choice
a
friend
right
one
of
the
friends
from
whom
you
so
efficiently
separated
her
damn
right
i
did
you
should've
seen
her
they
won't
be
talking
to
each
other
for
a
long
long
hang
on
i
think

might've
detected
a
small
flaw
so
you
failed
well
hey
you're
supposed
to
be
so
smart
you
let
me
plan
this
thing
okay
let's
not
quibble
about
who
failed
who
the
important
thing
is
make
sure
the
slayer
is
where
we
want
go
gone
so
uh
we'll
do
this
chip
thing
when
i
get

something
i've
been
assuming

hit
me
a
hexogonic
key
pattern

hey
look
you
did
it
i
didn't
i
haven't
even
finished
typing
in
the
new
code
something's
doing
it
must
be
programmed
to
selfdecrypt
to
a
certain
point
that
is
so
annoying
it's
like
someone
blurting
out
the
answer
to
a
riddle
just
when
you'vei
mean
yippee
we
have
the
information

walking
corpse
so
are
you
no
got
that
wrong
i'm
surging
with
life
and
strength
adam
made
me
to
be
nearly
as
bad
as
he
is
really
looking
forward
to
trying
out
your
girl
again
i'm
sorry
forrest

be
this
is
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
i'm
free
of
all
my
weaknessesmy
doubts
he's
gonna
fix
you
up
too
soon
as
we
got
some
choice
parts
then
you
and
me
will
be
back
on
the
same
side
again
moving
toward
a
new
future
i'll
never
let
that
happen
you
don't
get
it
brother
you
don't
have
a
choice
your
will
belongs
to
us
now
no
that's
not
true
then
why
don't
you
get
out
of
that
chair
and
walk
out
of
here
you
can't
control
my
riley
be
a
good
boy
where's
anya
oddly
anya
decided
not
to
join
us
despite
all
the
fun
we
had
at
our
last
meeting
and
i
don't
think
tara
felt
welcome
why
because
of
the
things
that
we
said
will
who
told
you
we
were
talking
behind
your
back
specifically
well
umspike
specifically
but
and
who
told
you
that
we
thought
you'd
be
better
off
joining
the
army
that's
notexactly
what
he
said
well
uhssspike
can
be
very
convincing
whenwhenwhen
uhi'm
very
stupid
he
played
us
he
wanted
us
to
fight
to
split
us
up
that's
where
it
came
from
the
stuff
we
said
the
other
night
of
course
well
piffle
let's
move
on
i'm
movin'
me
too
good
great
sowhy
do
you
think
spike
made
with
the
head
games
he's
all
dressed
up
with
no
one
to
bite
he's
gotta
get
his
yayas
somehow
i
think
it
was
more
than
that
i
think
it
was
adam
spike's
working
for
adam
after
all
we've
donenah
i
can't
even
act
surprised
i
just
went
to
adam's
lair
and
he
was
gone
but
spike
just
happened
to
be
there
he
made
this
big
noise
about
getting
information
off
those
encrypted
disks
oh
i
decrypted
them
well
they
decrypted
themselves
but
i
almost
had
it
what
did
they
say
a
bunch
of
stuff
we
already
know
about
314
but
it
also
said
there's
some
final
phase
where
adam
manufactures
a
bunch
of
creepy
cyberdemonoids
like
him
there's
a
special
lab
in
the
initiative
but
it
didn't
say
where
adam
fed
spike
those
disks
it
has
to
be
he
wanted
me
to
know
about
his
evilguy
assembly
line
this
lab
it's
in
the
initiative
hidden
somewhere
we'll
give
the
demon
his
due
he
thought
this
one
out
what
do
you
mean
you
know
how
overcrowded
the
containment
cells
have
been
at
the
initiative
those
demons
were
just
too
easy
to
catch
it's
like
they
wanted
in
that
place
the
trojan
horse
adam's
gonna
make
sure
the
demons
attack
the
initiative
from
the
inside
demons
versus
soldiers
massacre
massacre
and
adam
has
a
neat
pile
of
body
parts
to
start
assembling
his
army
diabolical
yet
gross
does
anybody
else
miss
the
mayor
i
just
wanna
be
a
big
snake
i've
got
to
shut
him
down
giles
his
final
phase
is
about
to
start
we
need
to
warn
the
initiative
they're
not
gonna
listen
to
me
riley
he's
a
deserter
he
got
some
bad
news
anyway
and
kinda
took
off
okay
i'm
confused
again
adam
has
this
evil
plan
why
is
he
so
anxious
for
you
to
know
about
it
he
wants
me
there
probably
figures
i'll
even
the
kill
ratio
he's
not
worried
you
might
kill
oh
say
him
no
he's
really
not
she's
coming
i
can
feel
it
good
on
you
got
a
chunk
of
prognosticating
demon
in
there
right
now
if
you'll
just
get
this
chip
out
of
my
cranium
i'll
be
out
of
your
way
and
mind
the
hairline
i
don't
fancy
fussing
over
a
combover
as
i
resume
my
killing
ways
come
on
we
had
a
deal
when
she's
here
certainly
no
lack
of
supplies
i
only
wish
i
knew
which
ones
would
kill
adam
according
to
riley
his
power
source
is
uranium
core
embedded
somewhere
inside
his
chest
probably
near
the
spine
great
so
we
just
ask
him
to
lie
down
quietly
while
we
do
some
exploratory
surgery
what
about
magic
some
kind
of
i
don't
knowuranium
extracting
spell
i
know
i'm
reaching
perhaps
a
paralyzing
spell
only
i
can't
perform
the
incantation
for
this
right
don't
you
have
to
speak
it
in
sumerian
or
something
i
do
speak
sumerian
it's
not
that
only
aan
experienced
witch
can
incant
it
and
you'd
have
to
be
within
striking
distance
of
this
object
see
what
you
get
for
takin'
french
instead
of
sumerian
what
was
i
thinking
so
no
problem
all
we
need
is
to
combine
buffyher
with
slayer
strength
giles'
multilingual
know
how
and
willow's
witchy
power
yeah
don't
tell
me
i'm
just
full
of
helpful
suggestions
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
are
nervous
no
way
i'm
full
of
that
good
old
kamikaze
spirit
xander
just
because
this
is
never
gonna
work
there's
no
need
to
be
negative
the
adjoining
spell
is
it
powerful
enough
to
defeat
adam
it's
very
powerful
it's
also
extraordinarily
dangerous
game
faces
guys
we're
going
in
how
you
doing
super
what
was
i
thinkin'
using
stairs
all
this
time
okay
will
willow
no
really
buffy
it's
not
as
scary
as
i
thought
no
it's
not
what
i
was
gonna
say
i
justi'm
sorry
i
hate
that
things
have
been
so
strained
between
all
of
us
it's
not
your
fault
spike
stirred
up
trouble
yeah
but
i
think
trouble
was
stiruppable
i
think
we've
all
sort
of
drifted
apart
this
year
don't
you
maybe
a
little
but
you
know
first
year
of
college
it's
hard
to
keep
the
old
high
school
gang
together
but
i
want
it
together
will
i
miss
you
and
giles
and
xander
and
it
is
my
fault
i've
been
wrapped
up
in
my
own
stuff

been
a
bad
friend

the
slayer
buffy

stuff

pretty
crucial

what's
the
other
way
oh
come
on
it's
not
like
i
wasn't
trying
that's
worth
something
isn't
it
i
suppose
yes
i
will
honor
our
agreement
to
remove
your
chip
take
his
head
off
let
him
go
there's
nowhere
left
to
run
colonel
shut
up
you've
got
some
nerve
lady
you
think
you
and
your
friends
can
just
keep
waltzing
into
a
government
installation
brandishing
weapons
like
like
it's
a
gourd
magic
gourd
what
kind
of
freaks
are
you
people
adam
is
here
colonel
in
the
initiative
nice
try
those
overcrowded
containment
cells
of
yours
courtesy
of
adam
he's
pulling
a
trojan
horse
on
you
he's
just
waiting
everything
in
this
installation
is
under
24hour
surveillance
including
the
secret
lab
including
everything
what
secret
lab
the
one
adam's
been
using
the
one
built
for
the
final
stage
of
the
314
project
and
you
have
no
idea
what
i'm
talking
about
i
know
everything
that
goes
on
around
here
a
tick
on
a
mouse
couldn't
get
in
without
my
knowing
it
and
if
adam
wants
to
try
we're
ready
for
him
jolly
good
howhow
exactly
do
you
plan
to
get
close
enough
to
adam
to
remove
his
power
source
hit
him
simultaneously
with
multiple
taser
blasters
incapacitate
him
with
as
much
voltage
as
we
can
muster
great
plan
that's
right
up
there
with
duck
and
cover
i've
seen
adam
hit
with
taser
blasts
he
feeds
on
it
and

provide
him
with
an
allyoucaneat

no
comprehension
of
and
you
do
i'm
the
slayer

power
but
yours
is
right
here
buffy
wow
that
was
nasty
sort
of
fellow
lucky
for
you
blighters
i
was
here
eh
yes
thank
you
although
your
heroism
has
been
slightly
muted
by
the
fact
that
you
were
helping
adam
to
start
a
war
that
would
kill
us
all
you
probably
just
saved
us
so
we
wouldn't
stake
you
right
here
did
it
work
well
then
everything's
all
right
and
we
all
get
to
be
not
staked
through
the
heart
good
work
team
buffy
wasn't
it
amazing
you
were
great
we
were
great
we
still
got
men
out
there
well
let's
go
save
'em
by
gum
you
guys
get
to
the
exits
get
'em
open
you
organize
the
soldiers
pull
'em
back
i'll
take
point
are
you
up
to
this
i
am
it
was
an
experiment
the
initiative
represented
the
government's
interests
in
not
only
controlling
the
otherworldly
menace
but
harnessing
its
power
for
our
own
military
purposes
the
considered
opinion
of
this
counsel
is
that
this
experiment
has
failed
once
the
prototype
took
control
of
the
complex
our
soldiers
suffered
a
40
percent
casualty
rate
only
through
the
actions
of
the
deserter
and
a
group
of
civilian
insurrectionists
that
our
losses
were
not
total
i
trust
the
irony
of
that
is
not
lost
on
any
of
us
maggie
walsh's
vision
was
brilliant
but
ultimately
unsupportable
the
demons
cannot
be
harnessed
cannot
be
controlled
it
is
therefore
our
recommendation
that
this
project
be
terminated
and
all
records
concerning
it
expunged
our
soldiers'll
be
debriefed
standard
confidentiality
clause
we
will
monitor
the
civilians
and
usual
measures
prepared
should
they
try
to
go
public
i
don't
think
they
will
the
initiative
itself
will
be
filled
in
with
concrete
burn
it
down
gentlemen
burn
it
down
and
salt
the
earth
