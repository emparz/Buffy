very
fond

the
uh
the
telephone
i
i
i
hope

not
out
of
line
but
iii
wanted
to
say
how
sorry
i
am
about
uh
that
teacher
ms
calendar
buffy
said
you
were
close
oh
uh
thank
you
buffy's
been
so
down
since
it

uh
she'll
be
fine

i
babble

i'm
nervous
i
just
wanted

you
do
you
think
she's
gonna
be
okay
in
here
i
don't
know
lysette
got
her
nose
done
here
and
she
came
in
looking
for
the
gwyneth
paltrow
and
it
looked
more
like
the
mr
potatohead
cordy
buffy's
not
here
for
cosmetic
surgery
no
but
while
she's
in
here
she
might
as
well
get
that
thing
done
you
know
that
thing
on
her
face
you
know
that
thing
do
you
think
angel
will
attack
buffy
in
here
he
can
come
in
it's
a
public
building
that's
true
am
i
the
only
one
that's
noticed
that
thing
you'll
be
fine
is
that
better
man
i
hate
it
when
you
lose
the
young
ones
i'm
just
saying
step
back
on
the
dosage
until
we
can
analyze
the
results
there
isn't
time
i
should
think
that
would
be
clear
to
you
by
now
the
normal
course
of
treatment
they
aren't
responding
to
the
normal
course
of
treatment
look
they're
getting
worse
raising
their
temperatures
is
poten
dr
wilkinson
i
have
the
consent
of
the
parents
they're
desperate
they
don't
understand
what
you're
you
know
what
ifif
you
have
a
problem
with
my
methods
just
take
it
up
with
the
board
i
have
he
comes
at
night
the
grownups
don't
see
him
he
was
with
tina
who
death
visiting

over
well
i'm
pretty
much
family
yeah
why
don't
you
come
back
during
the
day
oh
gee
no
i
guess
you
can't
if
i
decide
to
walk
into
buffy's
room
do
you
think
for
one
microsecond
that
you
could
stop
me
maybe
not
maybe
that
security
guard
couldn't
either
or
those
cops
or
the
orderlies
but
i'm
kinda
curious
to
find
out
you
game
buffy's
white
knight
you
still
love
her
it
must
just
eat
you
up
that
i
got

gonna
die
and
i'm
gonna
be
there

me
thank
you
power
girl

how
are
you
feeling
looks
like
your
fever's
gone
down
well
good
thanks
for
having
me
let's
try
and
keep
in
touch
not
so
fast
hmm
good
'hmm'
or
bad
'hmm'
swelling's
gone
does
this
hurt
nope
amazing
well
then
i
should
probably
go
right
no
soon
we
have
to
make
sure
that
fever
is
gone
that's
a
strong
virus
you
have
maybe
not
as
strong
as
you
but
iis
that
the
same
virus
the
kids
have
may
we
come
in
please
maybe
you
can
keep
our
patient
from
bolting
rest
hmm
flowers
for
milady
i
think
they
call
those
balloons
yeah
stick
'em
in
water
maybe
they'll
grow
not
to
be
outdone
homework
it's
my
way
of
saying
'get
well
soon'
you
know
chocolate
says
that
even
better
i
did
all
your
assignments
all
you
have
to
do
is
sign
your
name
chocolate
means
nothing
to
me
nobody
told
me
i
was
supposed
to
bring
a
gift
i
was
out
of
the
loop
on
gifts
it's
it's
tradition
among
um
people
um
grapes
well
did
you
uh
pass
the
night
well
enough
not
really
something
happened
i
thought
you
you
know
what
let's
take
a
walk
now
this
part
i
could
get
used
to
do
you
want
me
to
go
real
fast
not
that
i
would
we
were
discussing
um
stuff
yes
stuff
um
you
know
a
girl
died
here
last
night
how
well
the
flu
flu
doesn't
exactly
sound
monsterrific
i
know
but
there's
this
dr
backer
and
he's
been
giving
them
these
experimental
treatments
ii'm
not
sure
what
he's
up
to
but
he's
a
little
creepy
aand
then
there
was
this
kid
ryan
he
said
he
saw
something
saw
what
death
death
the
death
as
in
'it
is
your
time'
buffy
aaa
frightened
child
yeah
but
i
thought
i
saw
something
i'm
not
sure
i
was
really
out
of
it
but
but
you
do
know
that
you
saw
death
did
it
have
an
hourglass
ooo
if
he
asks
you
to
play
chess
don't
even
do
it
the
guy's
like
a
whiz
maybe
it
wasn't
death
maybe
it
was
something
else
so
this
isn't
about
you
being
afraid
of
hospitals
'cause
your
friend
died
and
you
wanna
conjure
up
a
monster
that
you
can
fight
so
you
can
save
everybody
and
not
feel
so
helpless
cordelia
have
you
actually
ever
heard
of
tact
tact
is
just
not
saying
true
stuff
i'll
pass
your
mom
did
tell
us
about
your
cousin
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
this
little
boy
ryan
is
afraid
of
something
something
real
as
long
as
i'm
forced
to
stay
here
i'm
gonna
find
out
what
so
is
this
the
part
where
we
say
what
can
we
do
to
help
you
had
to
ask
that
didn't
you
pft
it'll
be
cake
just
gotta
figure
out
what
killed
this
little
girl
tina
we'll
be
out
five
minutes
tops
this
is
what
happens
when
you're
compassionate
towards
sick
people
they
take
advantage
of
you
uhhuh
buffy
almost
died
just
to
put
you
out
i
didn't
wanna
be
the
first
one
to
say
it
you
there
me
here
right
what
are
you
doing
here
so
where
do
we
start
hmm
oh
i
don't
know
maybe
look
into
the
history
of
the
hospital
bizarre
incidents
that
sort
of
thing
i'm
sensing
a
little
less
than
full
committal
here
oh
ii
suppose
so
cordelia
may
be
homerically
insensitive
but
she
may
also
be
right
death
and
disease
are
are
things
possibly
the
only
things
that
that
buffy
cannot
fight
it's
only
natural
for
her
to
try
to
create
aa
defeatable
opponent
that's
true
but
on
the
'we
live
on
the
hellmouth'
side
these
kids
may
have
seen
a
monster
what
a
monster
that
grownups
can't
see
doesn't
ring
a
bell
unless
unless
well
sometimes
small
children
do
see
something
we
adults
don't
us
our
true
selves
our
our
our
hidden
faces
so
the
kids
might
be
afraid
of
a
regular
person
stanley
backer
was
his
name
no
let's
look
him
up
you
know
most
people
think
that
security
guards
are
just
guys
that
failed
the
police
exam
but
that's
not
me
this
is
my
career
stereotypes
are
so
unfair
i
did
take
the
fireman's
exam
though
i
didn't
do
so
good
oh
well
you
know
i
think
that
security
guards
are
way
sexier
than
firemen
they're
all
sooty
well
this
is
where
all
the
action
is
anyhow
i'm
all
the
time
restraining
people
mm
how
thrilling
do
you
ever
get
scared
'fear
is
for
the
weak'
that's
my
motto
either
that
or
'live
in
the
now'
i
haven't
decided
yet
i
bet
you
see
a
lot
of
tragedy
you
know
like
that
little
girl
oh
one
of
dr
backer's
patients
dr
backer's
a
great
man
he
understands
the
real
truth
about
children
what's
that
sometimes
they
die
what
was
that
uh
you
know
i
didn't
hear
anything
you
know
you
have
the
most
perfect
nose
i've
ever
seen
you
must
work
out
yeah
mmhm
could
you
make
just
a
little
more
with
the
touchygropey
jealous
of
rogaine
boy
i
don't
think
so
here
take
this
to
giles
okay
what
about
you
i'm
gonna
stay
here
oh
right
your
obsession
with
protecting
buffy
have
i
told
you
how
attractive
that's
not
cordelia
someone's
gotta
watch
her
back
yeah
well
i've
seen
you
watch
her
back
what
is
that
supposed
to
mean
well
i
was
using
the
phrase
'watch
her
back'
as
a
euphemism
for
'looking
at
her
butt'
you
know
sort
of
a
pun
oh
right
hey
well
you
do
jealous
fine
watch
my
back
hey
remember
me
you
shouldn't
be
here
why
not
contagious
nah
i
already
got
what
you
got
oh
what
you
think
because
i'm
a
grownup
believe
me
i'm
not
that
grown
up
he'll
come
again
tonight
ryan
listen
to
me
i'm
not
gonna
let
this
thing
hurt
you
any
of
you
grownups
don't
believe
you
right
well
i
do
we
both
know
that
there
are
real
monsters
but
there's
also
real
heroes
that
fight
monsters
and
that's
me
can't
fight
death
our
dr
backer
has
something
of
a
rap
sheet
reprimands
for
controversial
experiments
risky
procedures
a
malpractice
suit
looks
like
it
was
dropped
suddenly
factor
in
buffy's
observation
that
he
gives
her
the
um
uh
wiggins
this
may
be
our
death
guy
i
just
wish
i
knew
what
he
was
doing
to
these
children
yes
yes
uhh
uh
well
it
looks
as
if
you
uh
were
on
to
something
i
know
the
uh
the
the
girl
tina
um
it's
apparent
that
she
she
died
of
the
fever
simple
enough
but
but
her
records
show
her
improving
and
then
suddenly
deteriorating
www
without
any
apparent
cause
so
we
checked
dr
backer
out
this
guy
was
not
a
solid
citizen
it
wasn't
backer
he
was
clean
what
do
you
mean
'clean'
what
do
you
mean
'was'
he's
dead
this
thing
killed
him
and
not
with
kindness
you
saw
it
no
it's
invisible
i
saw
backer
nearly
shredded
and
the
thing
knocked
me
down
but
it's
real
which
means
i
get
to
fight
it
um
this
is
your
work
no
one
of
the
kids
oh
um
well
it
would
help
ifif
we
knew
what
it
was
iit's
invisible
to
you
but
the
the
children
can
see
it
but
you
said
you
did
see
something
the
other
night
uh
yeah
but
i
was
pretty
delirious
i
mean
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
why
would
i
see
it
then
and
not
last
night
good
morning
ooo
looks
like
i
interrupted
a
secret
meeting
you
sure
didn't
honey
i
i
just
talked
to
the
doctor
and
she
said
i
can
take
you
home
no
i
should
stay
here
but
honey
i
thought
you'd
be
raring
i
think
my
symptoms
are
flaring
up
she
doesn't
look
well
'cause
i'm
not
well
uh
i
feel
all
oogy
increased
ooginess
that's
a
danger
signal
are
you
sure
oh
yeah
but
just
for
a
day
or
sso
okay
well
i'll
uh
i'll
talk
to
the
doctor
so
what's
the
drill
giles
see
if
you
can
get
a
mug
shot
on
that
guy
i
need
to
know
what
i'm
fighting
right
yes
i'll
check
backer's
office
see
if
i
can
find
any
postits
marked
'why
a
monster
might
want
me
dead'
xander
sounds
like
a
plan
course
if
i
find
anything
i
won't
know
what
it
means
so
will
oh
yeah
i'm
good
at
medical
stuff
since
xander
and
i
used
to
play
doctor
all
the
time
no
she's
being
literal
she
used
to
have
all
these
medical
volumes
uh
and
diagnosed
me
with
stuff
i
didn't
have
the
heart
to
tell
her
she
was
playing
it
wrong
wrong
why
how
did
you
play
doctor
i
never
have
um
fascinating
though
this
is
yeah
right
go
wwwe'll
call
you
if
we
know
something
know
something
soon
i'd
best
head
for
the
library
research
beckons
i'm
on
sentry
duty
angel
won't
show
till
sundown
if
at
all
but
maybe
i'll
get
lucky
with
this
death
guy
he's
invisible
yeah
but
if
i
see
a
floating
pipe
and
a
smoking
jacket
he's
dropped
well
you
two
stay
alert
finding
out
who
this
thing
is
takes
priority
cordy
you
should
go
with
giles
why
do
i
have
to
have
uh
good
thinking
iii
could
do
with
a
research
assistant
let's
go
tactguy
yes
be
careful
it's
weird
going
through
his
things
yep
another
person
i
wasn't
in
time
to
save
it's
too
bad
angel
didn't
put
me
in
the
hospital
sooner
there's
something
i
never
thought
i'd
hear
myself
say
hey
wait
i
think
i
have
something
hmm
sherlock
okay
this
makes
sense
dr
backer
was
trying
to
inoculate
the
kids
with
a
controlled
dosage
of
the
same
virus
they
already
had
oh
raising
their
temperatures
to
burn
the
fever
out
of
them
would
that
work
according
to
this
it
was
starting
to
so
he
really
was
trying
to
help
the
kids
till
that
thing
stopped
him
eww
what
does
this
do
what
what
does
this
do
uh
it
uh
extracts
vital
organs
to
replenish
its
own
mutating
cells
wow
what
does
this
one
do
um
iit
elongates
its
mouth
to
uh
engulf
its
victim's
head
with
its
incisors
ouch
wait
what
does
this
one
do
it
asks
endless
questions
of
those
with
whom
it's
supposed
to
be
working
so
that
nothing
is
getting
done
boy
there's
a
demon
for
everything
i
don't
even
know
if
we're
on
the
right
track
since
this
uh
miscreant
has
only
been
seen
by
select
individuals
there's
a
chance
we
won't
ever
find
a
picture
of
it
well
it's
not
in
here
it's
called
der
kindestod
who
is
this
it's
me
i've
got
your
monster
where's
giles
looking
up
stuff
well
can
you
put
him
on
hey
i
found
your
guy
okay
just
listen
right
the
name
means
'child
death'
this
book
says
that
he
feeds
off
of
children
by
sucking
the
life
out
of
them
eew
but
anyway
afterwards
it
looks
like
they
died
because
they
were
sick
so
it
did
kill
tina
yeah
that's
my
take
'cause
it
would
be
looking
at
the
children's
ward
as
basically
an
allyoucaneat
kind
of
thing
y'know
backer
was
curing
the
kids
and
taking
away
the
kindestod's
food
hence
the
sliceage
i
found
a
picture
of
how
it
kills
let
me
talk
to
her
oh
eww
what
oh
uh
you
should
see
this
thing
the
way
it
does
its
thing

let
you

drag
me
into
this
stuff
uh
uh
