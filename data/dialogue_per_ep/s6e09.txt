i'm
sure
we
can
work
something
out
a
deal
of
some
sort
anything
you
want
i
always
wanted
a
pony
oh
you
weren't
really
speaking
to
me
were
you
my
bad
well
as
long
as
i'm
here
wow
a
mugging
haven't
gotten
one
of
those
in
a
while
usually
it's
blood
and
with
the
horror
just
a
good
oldfashioned
mugging
kinda
sweet
actually
oh
uh
probably
not
for
you
here
go
now
not
too
sweet
for
you
either
huh
but
come
on
rush
me
it'll
be
funny
yaah
no
gah
oh
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
i
thought
they
were
demons
way
to
go
with
the
keen
observiness
jessica
fletcher
remind
me
not
to
help
you
more
often
hey
little
sympathy
for
the
man
with
the
migraine
here
can
we
well
that's
what
you
get
for
attacking
a
human
yeah
you'd
think
if
the
government
was
gonna
put
a
chip
in
my
head
they'd
at
least
make
it
so
i
could
attack
criminals
and
that
sort
yes
because
muggers
deserve
to
be
eaten
just
have
to
get
your
rocks
off
fightin'
demons
there
are
other
ways
and
to
that
an
extreme
'see

the
only
one

love
the
learning
rusty
museums
libraries
disney
hall
of
presidents
not

more
to
the
point
goodbye

cool
the
freeze
ray
totally
worked

a
kink
or
two

us
and
say
what
'two

yeah
that
never

ends
well
does
it
it
did
the
other
night
you
really
seem
awfully
fixated
on
a
couple
of
kisses
spike
and
you
seem
awfully
quick
to
forget
about
them
look
i'm
sorry
okay
i'mi'm
sorry
if
you
thought
that
it
meant
more
but
but
when
i
kissed
you
you
know
i
was
thinking
about
giles
right
you
know
i
always
wondered
about
you
two
what
oh
gross
spike
he
left
i
was
depressed
ergo
vulnerability
and
and
bad
kissing
decisions
okay
but
that's
all
that
it
was
you
have
to
let
it
go
did
it
work
what
you
convince
yourself
please
stop
a
man
can
change
you're
not
a
man
you're
a
thing
stop
walking
away
don't
touch
me
ahh
ahh
ohh
you're
a
thing
an
evil
disgusting
thing
look
at
all
the
goodies
that's
right
you
should
scream
creature
of
the
night
here
yeah
some
people
forget
that
please
she
thinks
i'm
housebroken
she
forgot
who
she's
dealing
with
anything
you
want
please
just
'cause
she's
confused
about
where
she
fits
in
i'm
supposed
to
be
too
'cause
i'm
not
i
know
what
i
am
i'm
dangerous
i'm
evil
ii'm
sure
you're
not
evil
yes
i
am
i
am
a
killer
that's
what
i
do
i
kill
and
yeah
maybe
it's
been
a
long
time
but
it's
not
like
you
forget
how
you
just
do
it
and
now
i
can
again
all
right
so
here
goes
this
might
hurt
a
little
what
the
hell
is
going
on
good
god
that's
a
lot
of
shake
i
mean
i
know
part
of
our
big
movie
and
milkshake
fun
day

a
lot
of
shake

wash
down
the
raisinettes
promise
me
that
you
will
eat
something
green
tonight
leafy
green
not
gummi
green
the
movie
was
fun
yeah
it
was
ironic
when
all
those
cute
innercity
kids
taught
their
coach
a
valuable
lesson
you
know
that
i
will
always
be
there
for
you
right
there
there
was
actually
more
of
a
leadin
when
i
practiced
that
at
home
i
know
it's
just
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
my
moving
out
had
nothing
to
do
with
you
and
i
i
will
never
stop
loving
you
i
know
do
you
think
you'll
ever
get
back
together
i
wish
i
knew
but
you
still
love
her
very
much
i
just
sometimes
other
things
get
in
the
way
i
know
uh
she's
been
doing
a
lot
better
lately
though
uh
she's
been
really
good
about
being
careful
aabout
stuff
well
good
great
that's
that's
great
here
says
the
guard's
definitely
gonna
live
he's
all
thawed
out
says
they
used
hairdryers
huh
everything
slowed
down
his
nervous
system
circulatory
system
he's
still
unconscious
anya
it's
such
a
pain
the
text
i
wanted
giles
took
it
with
him
he
has
this
thing
that
owning
a
book
makes
it
like
his
property
what
should
we
do
should
we
call
him
it's
like
the
middle
of
last
night
there
or
maybe
it's
tomorrow
anyone
remember
how
that
works
that's
okay
no
one
freak
we'll
just
do
it
another
way
ii
don't
think
we
need
to
resort
to
i
mean
oh
hey
cool
all
right
back
to
basics
a
little
oldfashioned
stateoftheart
hacker
action
that's
great
will
i
haven't
seen
you
do
that
in
a
long
time
ii
don't
remember
that
part
it's
quicker
it'll
just
take
me
a
sec
to
go
through
the
files
okay
internal
police
report
a
diamond
was
stolen
from
the
museum
last
night
a
big
one
on
loan
from
the
british
museum
they're
withholding
information
to
smoke
out
the
criminals
oh
it's
pretty
there's
a
picture
well
is
it
a
a
supernatural
diamond
you
know
like
healing
powers
or
or
goodlucky

we'll
keep
checking
shall

that's
tiring
that
thing
you're
doing
there

the
deal
with
oh
for
crying
out
loud
this
is
bizarre
you're
all
'la
la
la'

with
the
magic
and
the
not

like
everything's
normal
when
we
all

way
little
things
just
starting
taking
over
things

we
saw
them
differently

got
blown
out
of
proportion

gotta
be
something
wrong
no
no
listen
i
don't
know
what
that
thing
does
i'd
like
to
hey
but
whatever
it
is
it
works
fine
there's
no
deterioration
of
the
signal
it
still
is
coming
through
on
a
steady
pulse
which
it's
supposed
to
if
you're
lying
to
me
no
it's
all
right
here
i
i
mean
it
is
it's
really
not
that
hard
to
figure
out
if
you
just
what
you
tell
anyone
about
this
no
i
promise
who
would
i
tell
i
don't
even
know
what
this
is
about

about
the
rules

changed
everything's
different

some
research
well

i
i

wait
for
them
then
you
can
get
a
chance
to
catch
up
with
everyone

a
great
idea

has
nothing
to
do
with
anyone
else

gnaw
so
much
hey

we're
just
getting
started
i
think
i'm
gonna

this
one
out
nuhuh

relaxed
aha
i
got
it
uh
here's
our
villain
right
here
what
that's
a
dd
manual
sweetie
no
but
it
could
oh
let's
face
it
we're
not
gonna
find
this
thing
because
it
doesn't
exist
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
frost
monster
who
eats
diamonds
well
maybe
he
doesn't
eat
them
you
know
maybe
he
just
thinks
they're
pretty
we
suck
we
need
new
brains
what's
up
with
willow
out
with
amy
i
guess
great
someone
to
do
more
magic
with
but
at
least
she's
not
all
cooped
up
and
crying
that's
forward
momentum
now
i
know
that
i
don't
know
everything
that
happened
with
her
and
tara
but
it
tara
thinks
willow
is
doing
too
much
magic
and
she's
not
the
only
one
i
know
but
ii
think
she'll
be
fine
you
know
it's
it's
willow
she
of
the
level
head
well
those
are
the
ones
you
have
to
watch
out
for
the
most
responsible
types
right
she
might
go
crazy
and
start
alphabetizing
everything
i'm
serious
responsible
people
are
always
so
concerned
with
being
good
all
the
time
that
when
they
finally
get
a
taste
of
being
bad
they
can't
get
enough
it's
like
all
kablooey
that's
not
true
okay
not
kablooey
more
like
bam
it's
human
nature
buff
will's
getting
a
taste
of
something
powerful
way
bigger
than
her
yeah
she
was
getting
out
of
control
with
it
before
tara
left
and
now
that
she's
gone
it's
gotta
be
seductive
just
giving
in
to
it
going
totally
wild
we
need
to
keep
an
eye
on
her
okay
okay
we'll
we'll
keep
an
eye
but
we
can't
assume
that
everybody's
getting
seduced
you
know
sometimes
hello
