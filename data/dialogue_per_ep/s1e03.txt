this
is
madness
what
can
you
have
been
thinking
you
are
the
slayer
lives
depend
upon
you
i
make
allowances
for
your
youth
but
i
expect
a
certain
amount
of
responsibility
and
instead
of
which
you
enslave
yourself
to
this
this
you
don't
like
the
color
i
d
do
you
um
do
you
ignore
everything
i
say
as
a
as
a
rule
no
i
believe
that's
your
trick
i
told
you
i'm
trying
out
for
the
cheerleading
squad
you
have
a
sacred
birthright
buffy
you
were
chosen
to
destroy
vampires
not
to
wave
pompoms
at
people
and
as
the
watcher
i
forbid
it
and
you'll
be
stopping
me
how
well
i
i
will
still
have
time
to
fight
the
forces
of
evil
okay
i
just
wanna
have
a
life
i
wanna
do
something
normal
something
safe
giles
didn't
approve
huh
he
totally
lost
his
water
we
haven't
seen
a
vampire
in
over
a
week
i'd
say
he
should
get
a
girlfriend
if
he
wasn't
so
old
well
we're
behind
you
people
scoff
at
things
like
school
spirit
but
look
at
these
girls
giving
their
all
like
this
ooo
stretchy
where
was
i
you
were
pretending
that
seeing
scantily
clad
girls
in
revealing
postures
was
a
spiritual
experience
who
said
i
was
pretending
oh
hey
here's
a
good
luck
thing
for
tryouts
what's
this
what's
that
oh
how
sweet
'yours
always'
xander
iiit
came
that
way
really
they
all
said
that
just
look
at
that
amber
who
does
she
think
she
is
a
laker
girl
i
heard
she
turned
them
down
okay
listen
up
let's
begin
with
amber
grove
if
you're
not
auditioning
move
off
the
floor
amy
hi
hi
i
didn't
know
you
wanted
to
be
a
cheerleader
you
lost
a
lot
of
weight
had
to
do
you
know
buffy
hi
hi
oh
how
i
hate
this
let
me
count
the
ways
she
trained
with
benson
he's
one
of
the
best
coaches
money
can
buy
they
have
cheerleading
coaches
oh
yeah
don't
you
have
i
train
with
my
mom
three
hours
in
the
morning
three
at
night
hmm
that
much
quality
time
with
my
mom
would
probably
lead
to
some
quality
matricide
oh
i
know
it's
hokey
but
she's
really
great
hmm
what
the
that
girl's
on
fire
enough
of
the
hyperbole
it's
okay
it's
okay
you're
gonna
be
okay
god
i've
been
slaying
vampires
for
more
than
a
year
now
and
i
have
seen
some
pretty
cringe
worthy
things
but
nobody's
hands
ever
got
toasted
before
i
imagine
not
so
this
isn't
a
vampire
problem
no
but
it
is
funky
right
not
of
the
norm
quite
spontaneous
human
combustion
is
is
rare
and
and
scientifically
unexplainable
but
there
have
been
cases
for
hundreds
of
years
usually
all
that's
left
is
a
pile
of
ashes
that's
all
that
would
have
been
left
if
it
hadn't
been
for
buffy
so
we
have
no
idea
what
caused
this
that's
a
comfort
but
that's
the
thrill
of
living
on
the
hellmouth
there's
a
veritable
cornucopia
of
of
fiends
and
devils
and
and
ghouls
to
engage
pardon
me
for
finding
the
glass
half
full
any
common
denominators
in
cases
of
spontaneous
combustion
uh
rage
in
most
cases
the
person
who
combusted
was
was
terribly
angry
or
or
upset
so
maybe
amber's
got
this
power
to
make
herself
be
on
fire
it's
like
the
human
torch
only
it
hurts
i
need
to
get
the
skinny
on
amber
find
out
if
she's
had
any
colorful
episodes
before
that
means
hacking
illegally
into
the
school's
computer
system
i'll
ask
around
about
her
you
guys
don't
have
to
get
involved
what
d'ya
mean
we're
a
team
aren't
we
a
team
yeah
you're
the
slayer
and
we're
like
the
slayerettes
i
just
don't
like
putting
you
guys
in
danger
oh
huh
i
laugh
in
the
face
of
danger
then
i
hide
until
it
goes
away
okay
just
walk
softly
at
least
until
we
know
a
little
more
i
mean
what
if
amber
isn't
causing
these
problems
herself
well
then
we
have
to
determine
who
or
what
did
and
uh
deal
with
it
accordingly
hey
hi
how
was
school
mm
a
reverent
joy
what's
all
this
it's
for
the
tribal
art
display
cool
we
had
tryouts
today
oh
great
how'd
it
go
i
didn't
actually
get
to
try
out
there
was
an
accident
pretty
fierce
competition
though
oh
i
know
you'll
do
fine
keep
on
pluggin'
just
have
to
get
back
on
the
horse
mom
yeah
what
was
i
trying
out
for
oh
uh
some
activity
i
have
no
idea
i'm
sorry
that's
okay
your
platitudes
are
good
for
all
occasions
i'm
distracted
got
a
lotta
inventory
to
go
through
here
this
is
my
gallery's
first
major
show
you
know
it
might
not
physically
kill
you
to
give
me
a
hand
here
it
was
cheerleading
oh
good
i'm
glad
you're
taking
that
up
again
it'll
keep
you
out
of
trouble
i'm
not
in
trouble
no
not
yet
i
mean
you
stopped
cheerleading
just
before
the
trouble
so
it's
good
you're
going
back
oh
dear
what
the
fertility
statue
you
don't
need
to
see
it
y'know
there's
this
girl
amy
and
um
she
trains
with
her
mom
like
three
hours
a
day
uhhuh
sounds
like
her
mom's
pretty
into
it
sounds
like
her
mom
doesn't
have
a
lot
to
do
jeepers
despite
the
terrible
thing
that
happened
yesterday
we
still
have
to
pick
new
cheerleaders
if
you
make
the
team
you'll
find
your
names
posted
in
the
quad
after
lunch
let's
begin
with
group
performance
why
do
my
hands
have
to
sweat
when
i
get
nervous
don't
worry
you'll
do
great
five
six
seven
eight
sunnydale
sunnydale
we
never
fail
we
never
fail
jump
and
shoot
swish
and
score
the
other
team
is
such
a
bore
yeah
you
saw
that
right
that
wasn't
me
you
saw
that
right
right
that's
my
mom
no
catherine
madison
get
down
with
your
bad
self
her
nickname
was
'catherine
the
great'
she
took
that
team
and
made
them
tricounty
champions
y'know
no
one's
ever
done
that
before
or
since
she
and
my
dad
were
homecoming
king
and
queen
they
got
married
right
after
graduation
that's
kinda
romantic
well
he
was
a
big
loser
never
made
any
money
ran
off
with
miss
trailer
trash
when
i
was
twelve
okay
that
part's
less
romantic
my
folks
split
up
too
drag
huh
uh
he
left
my
mom
with
nothing
she
put
herself
through
cosmetology
school
bought
me
everything
i
ever
wanted
and
never
once
gained
a
single
pound
uh
she
sounds
really
great
amy
but
um
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
need
to
lock
step
as
far
as
this
cheerleading
thing
she
was
the
best
and
i
can't
get
my
body
to
move
like
hers
i
choked
in
there
so
bad
no
amy
you
did
fine
i'm
gonna
get
changed
wait
no
hey
amy
is
she
okay
no
she's
she's
wiggin'
about
her
mom
big
cheer
queen
back
when
yeah
her
mom's
kinda
nazi
like
heil
if
she
gains
an
ounce
she
padlocks
the
fridge
and
won't
eat
anything
but
broth
so
mommy
dearest
is
really
mommy
dearest
there's
a
bitter
streak
but
amy's
nice
we
used
to
hang
in
junior
high
when
her
mom
would
go
on
a
broth
kick
amy'd
come
over
to
my
house
and
we'd
stuff
ourselves
with
brownies
hey
any
word
on
amber
nothing
thrilling
average
student
got
detention
once
for
smoking
regular
smoking
with
a
cigarette
not
like
being
smoky
hmm
all
pretty
normal
so
we
just
have
to
wait
and
we'll
see
what
happens
maybe
nothing
will
i
have
a
dream
it's
me
on
the
cheerleading
squad
adored
by
every
varsity
male
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
we
have
to
achieve
our
dreams
amy
otherwise
we
wither
and
die
look
i'm
sorry
about
shhh
if
your
supreme
klutziness
out
there
today
takes
me
out
of
the
running
you're
gonna
be
so
very
beyond
sorry
have
a
nice
day
i
told
buffy
about
amber
cool
was
she
wearin'
it
the
bracelet
she
was
wearin'
it
right
pretty
much
like
we're
goin'
out
except
without
the
hugging
or
kissing
or
her
knowing
about
it
so
i'm
just
a
figure
of
fun
i
should
ask
her
out
right
you
won't
know
till
you
ask
that's
why
you're
so
cool
you're
like
a
guy
you're
my
guy
friend
that
knows
about
girl
stuff
oh
great
i'm
a
guy
oh
hey
they're
posting
the
list
i
can't
take
this
yes
cover
me
i'm
goin'
in
you're
lucky
i
made
it
i
made
it
one
of
those
girls
hit
me
really
hard
you
should
test
for
steroids
okay
not
only
did
you
make
the
team
but
you
miss
summers
are
the
first
alternate
and
amy's
number
three
and
what
a
better
way
to
celebrate
than
with
a
romantic
drive
through
xander
alternates
are
the
ones
who
didn't
make
the
team
they
only
fill
in
if
something
happens
to
the
ones
who
did
excuse
me
for
i
am
xander
king
of
cretins
may
all
lesser
cretins
bow
before
me
at
least
it's
over
and
you
know
what
i
think
we
should
do
about
it
brownie
pigout
my
house
after
school
it's
just
how
many
more
hours
a
day
can
i
practice
y'know
how
much
more
can
i
do
this
would
never
happen
to
my
mother
never
give
me
the
power
give
me
the
dark
i
call
on
you
the
laughing
gods
let
your
blackness
crawl
beneath
my
skin
accept
thy
sacrifice
of
cordelia
feed
on
her
look
what
i
found
it's
my
yearbook
from
junior
year
oh
look
there
i
am
mom
i've
accepted
that
you've
had
sex
i
am
not
ready
to
know
that
you
had
farrah
hair
this
is
gidgit
hair
don't
they
teach
you
anything
in
history
well
it's
really
cool
but
i
gotta
book
well
i
was
thinking
i
know
the
cheerleading
thing
didn't
work
out
maybe
you
should
think
about
joining
the
yearbook
staff
i
did
it
was
a
lot
of
fun
not
really
my
tip
mom
i
was
uh
photo
editor
i
got
to
be
on
every
page
made
me
look
much
more
popular
than
i
was
and
have
you
seen
the
kids
that
do
yearbook
nerds
pick
on
them
some
of
the
best
times
i
had
in
school
were
working
on
the
yearbook
oh
this
just
in
i'm
not
you
i'm
into
my
own
thing
your
own
thing
whatever
it
is
got
you
kicked
out
of
school
and
we
had
to
move
here
to
find
a
decent
school
that
would
take
you
honey
uhhh
uhhh
great
parenting
form
little
shaky
on
the
dismount
cordelia
you
haven't
been
mean
to
me
all
day
is
it
something
i've
done
okay
see
how
she
has
no
clue
that
i'm
even
a
mammal
much
less
a
human
being
i
see
that
this
is
the
invisible
man
syndrome
a
blessing
in
cordelia's
case
a
curse
in
buffy's
you're
not
invisible
to
buffy
it's
worse
i'm
just
like
a
part
of
the
scenery
like
an
old
shoe
or
a
rug
that
you
walk
on
every
day
but
don't
even
really
see
it
like
a
pen
that's
all
chewed
up
and
you
know
you
should
throw
it
away
but
you
don't
not
'cause
you
like
it
so
much
more
'cause
you're
just
used
to
will
yeah
that
is
the
point
you
don't
have
to
drive
it
through
my
head
like
a
railroad
spike
i'm
gonna
take
your
advice
and
not
beat
around
the
bush
or
i
could
be
wrong
maybe
you
should
beat
around
the
bush
more
nah
i
gotta
be
a
man
and
ask
her
out
y'know
i
gotta
stop
giving
her
id
bracelets
uh
subtle
innuendos
taking
polaroids
outside
of
her
bedroom
window
late
at
night
that
last
part
is
a
joke
to
relieve
the
tension
because
here
she
comes
okay
into
battle
i
go
would
you
ask
her
out
for
me
no
man
me
battle
buffy
would
you
like
to
uh
is
that
even
cordelia's
locker
huh
oh
i
don't
know
what
i'm
saying
is
accompany
me
friday
night

have
to
um

can
make
this
up
later
you
don't
mind

it's
your
turn
to
drive

buckle

mr
pole
you've
flunked
driver's
ed
twice
already
show
me
some
moves
or
you'll
be
taking
the
bus
to
college
okay
check
the
brake
check
the
mirror
start
the
engine
hello
put
the
car
in
drive
let's
move
forward
through
the
cones
with
a
gentle
even
turn
to
the
slow
down
slow
slow
turn
right
turn
right
brakes
brakes
everybody
out
oh
my
god
i
i
can't
see
anything
it's
it's
okay
it's
oh
god
what's
happening
i
can't
see
anything
witchcraft
blinding
your
enemy
to
disorient
and
disable
them
is
it's
classic
first
vampires
now
witches
no
wonder
you
can
still
afford
a
house
in
sunnydale
why
should
someone
want
to
harm
cordelia
maybe
because
they
met
her
did
i
say
that
and
setting
amber
ablaze
yeah
those
guys
don't
hang
they're
both
cheerleaders
someone
doesn't
like
cheerleading
or
likes
it
too
much
amy
amy
so
you
guys
are
leaning
towards
amy
she's
desperate
to
get
on
that
team
and
i've
got
this
feeling
she'd
do
just
about
anything
to
make
her
mom's
dream
come
true
uh
let
me
make
sure
i
have
this
right
this
witch
is
casting
horrible
and
disfiguring
spells
so
that
she
can
become
a
cheerleader
i
think
you're
underestimating
the
amount
of
pressure
a
parent
can
lay
on
you
if
you're
not
a
picture
perfect
carbon
copy
they
tend
to
wig
cheerleading
was
kind
of
her
mom's
last
hurrah
look
we
still
have
to
stop
amy
we
should
grab
her
and
i
think
we
should
be
sure
she's
the
witch
before
we
arouse
her
suspicions
she's
she's
capable
of
some
fairly
unpleasant
things
okay
alright
so
you're
in
high
school
you
are
desperate
to
make
the
team
and
please
your
mom
so
you
turn
to
witchcraft
what's
the
first
thing
you're
gonna
do
check
out
the
books
on
witchcraft
uh
no
no
that
would
be
the
last
thing
you
would
do
you
don't
wanna
leave
a
paper
trail
forget
that
it'll
just
take
a
minute
we
don't
have
a
minute
cheerleaders
are
in
danger
buffy's
in
danger
you
were
the
first
alternate
you
are
on
the
team

cordelia's

you
could
be
next
we
gotta
get
you

roots
to
modern
practice'
checked
out
by
alexander
harris
'the
pagan
rites'
checked
out
by
alexander
alright
alright
it's
not
what
you
think
you
like
to
look
at
the
seminude
engravings
oh
well
uh
ii
guess
it
is
what
you
think
have
you
all
quite
finished
we
have
to
find
a
conclusive
test
well
that's
just
mercury
and
nitric
acid
you
can
get
that
in
the
science
lab
'heat
ingredients
and
apply
to
witch
and
if
a
spell
has
been
cast
in
the
previous
48
hours
witch's
skin
turns
blue'
hmm

need
some
eye

my
xandershaped
friend

any
idea
why
i
love
you
so
xander
we
gotta
to
get
her
to
a
let
her
speak
i'll
tell
you
you're
not
like
other
boys
at
all
well
you
are
totally
and
completely
one
of
the
girls
i'm
that
comfy
with
him
that's
great
any
other
guy
who'd
give
me
a
bracelet
they'd
wanna
date
me
and
be
like
a
oh
i
i
don't
feel
so
good
buffy
we've
gotta
get
her
to
a
hospital
they
can't
help
her
this
is
a
bloodstone
vengeance
spell
hits
the
body
hard
like
a
a
quart
of
alcohol
and
then
it
eeradicates
the
uh
immune
system
a
vengeance
spell
like
she's
trying
to
get
even
with
buffy
'cause
she
knows
i
know
she's
a
witch
the
others
she
just
wanted
out
of
the
running
you
she
intends
to
um
kill
how
much
time
do
we
have
oh
uh
i'm
sure
uh
truth
please
couple
of
hours
three
at
most
well
how
do
we
reverse
the
spell
well
i
i've
been
researching
that
and
uh
we
can
reverse
all
the
spells
if
um
we
can
just
lay
our
hands
on
on
amy's
spell
book
and
if
we
can't
get
a
hold
of
it
well
the
other
way
is
to
cut
the
witch's
head
off
show
of
hands
it's
not
amy's
fault
she
only
became
a
witch
to
survive
her
mother
look
i
don't
care
why
i
just
care
that
you
go
on
breathing
giles
where
would
she
be
casting
these
spells
oh
she
needs
a
a
sacred
space
aaa
pentagram
um
large
pot
her
home
okay
help
me
up
we'll
just
go
to
her
house
and
we'll
get
her
book

we'll
go
with
you
uh
no
you
guys
stay
here
and
keep
an
eye
on
amy
and
keep
her
away
from
the
science
lab
we'll
need
it
to
cast
our
counterspells
who
are
you

mrs
madison
we
need

with
something
very
dangerous
are
you
aware
of
that
uh
i
don't

be
home
soon
and
you
this
girl
is
very

and
you
will
listen
to
me
your
daughter
has
access
to
some
very
powerful
magics
and
somehow
your
obsession
with
cheerleading
has
made
i
don't
care
about
cheerleading
it's
not
my
fault
she's
doing
stuff
as
her
mother
you
should
assume
some
responsibility
for
her
actions
well
you
know
these
kids
today
i
she's
out
of
her
mind
ever
since
dad
her
dad
left
i
can't
control
her
you're
afraid
of
her
amy
are
you
amy
i
don't

she
switched
she
switched
your
bodies
didn't
she
good
lord
she
wanted
to
relive
her
glory
days
she
said
i
was
wasting
my
youth
so
she
took
it
i
didn't
know
anything
about
her
powers
i
mean
when
dad
was
here
they
would
fight
and
yell
and
he
would
call
her
a
witch
and
i
mean
i
would
just
thought

when
he
left
i
wanted
to
go
with
him
but
she
wouldn't
even
let
me
call
she
went
crazy

always
coming
down
on
me
telling
me
i
didn't
deserve
to
have
it
so
easy

yeah
i
took
care
of
it
i
don't

it
what
i've
been
doing
a
lot
of
thinking
about
where
you're
coming
from
how
to
relate
to
you
and
i've
come
to
a
very
simple
conclusion
i
don't
get
it
i'm
inscrutable
huh
you're
sixteen
i
think
there's
a
a
biological
imperative
whereby
i
can't
understand
you
because
i'm
not
sixteen
do
you
ever
wish
you
could
be
sixteen
again
oh
that's
a
frightful
notion
go
through
all
that
again
not
even
if
it
helped
me
understand
you
i
love
you
mom
i
don't
get
it
my
dad
is
so
impossible
he
doesn't
ever
want
me
going
anywhere
he
wants
to
spend
total
quantity
time
together
and
i'm
like
'dad
i
can
go
out
it's
perfectly
safe'
but
he's
got
all
this
guilt
about
leaving
me
with
my
mom
and
he's
being
a
total
pain
you're
loving
it
every
single
minute
this
saturday
night
he
wants
to
stay
in
and
make
brownies
well
the
brownies
were
my
idea
hey
i'm
really
sorry
you
guys
got
bumped
back
to
alternate
hold
it
wait
no
i'm
not
well
i
know
that
i'll
miss
the
intellectual
thrill
of
spelling
out
words
with
my
arms
ooo
these
grapes
are
sour
oh
i'm
sorry
i
forgot
that
you
wanted
to
be
on
the
squad
oh
hey
that's
okay
cheerleading's
just
a
little
too
hairy
for
me
these
days
that's
for
sure
catherine
the
great
and
there's
been
no
sign
of
her
that
last
spell
she
said
i'd
never
make
trouble
again
wherever
she
is
i
don't
think
we'll
have
to
worry
twisted
i'm
just
happy
to
have
my
body
back
i'm
thinking
of
getting
fat
y'know

hear
that
look's
in
for
spring
