there
is
nothing
but
you
you
are
the
center
and
within
you
there
is
the
core
of
your
being
of
what
you
are
find
it
breathe
into
it
focus
inward
let
the
world
fall
away
fall
away
fall
away
can
we
go
now
nobody
knows
who
i
am
not
the
real
me
it's
like
nobody
cares
enough
to
find
out
i
mean
does
anyone
ever
ask
me
what
i
want
to
do
with
my
life
or
what
my
opinion
is
on
stuff
or
what
restaurant
to
order
in
from
no
underline
exclamation
point
exclamation
point
exclamation
point
no
one
understands
no
one
has
an
older
sister
who's
a
slayer
people
wouldn't
be
so
crazy
about
her
if
they
had
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
her
every
single
day
everybody
cares
what
she
thinks
just
'cause
she
can
do
backflips
and
stuff
like
that's
such
a
crucial
job
skill
in
the
real
world
plus
mom
lets
her
get
away
with
everything
your
sister's
saving
the
world
i
could
so
save
the
world
if
somebody
handed
me
super
powers
but
i'd
think
of
a
cool
name
and
wear
a
mask
to
protect
my
loved
ones
which
buffy
doesn't
even
if
this
town
wasn't
so
lame
everyone
would
completely
know
what
she
does
and
then
i
bet
they
wouldn't
even
be
that
impressed
because
like
killing
things
with
wood
oh
scary
vampires
they
die
from
a
splinter
so
buffy

your
plans

a
surprise
of
the
nicest

surprised

thought

over
tomorrow
and
we'll
hang
and
then
i

today
are
we
giles

his
way
to
pick
me
up
oh

equally
as

no
doubt
okay

hook
up
later
are
you
mad
at
me
oh
no
not
at
all
i'm
plotting
your
death
but
in
a
happy
way
good
look

i
know
what
this
means
to
you
i
think
it's
great
that
you've
got
this
new
mission
i'll
see
you
tonight
bye
see
ya
kid
i'm
not
a
kid
well
i
sympathize
with
you
buffy
i
truly
do
but
i'm
certain
that
riley
understands
better
than
anyone
else
the
importance
of
training
you
can't
allow
personal
concerns
to
distract
you
from
dawn
will
you
stop
fiddling
with
the
radio
and
sit
down
i
don't
think
buffy's
watcher
likes
me
too
much
i
think
it's
'cause
he's
just
so
old
i'm
not
sure
how
old
he
is
but
i
heard
him
use
the
word
newfangled
one
time
so
he's
gotta
be
pretty
far
gone
there's
a
lot
of
books
on
this
list
any
of
them
come
on
tape
you
know
read
by
george
clooney
or
someone
cute
like
that
you're
entering
a
new
realm
here
buffy
one
for
which
i
myself
am
not
entirely
prepared
are
you
ready
for
this
commitment
i'm
just
kidding
hey
this
betty's
ready
color
me
committed
blast
you
put
it
in
neutral
again
huh
i'm
just
not
used
to
this
automatic
transmission
ii
loathe
this
sitting
here
not
contributing
no
iit's
not
working
out
giles
are
you
breaking
up
with
your
car
well
it
did
seduce
me
all
red
and
sporty
little
twodoor
tramp
iii
don't
know
i
just
i
was
so
at
loose
ends
ii
found
myself
searching
for
some
way
of
feeling
more
shallow
perhaps
as
i
am
to
act
as
your
watcher
again
a
modicum
of
respect
might
be
in
order
do
i
have
to
i'm
serious
buffy
there's
going
to
be
far
less
time
for
the
sort
of
flighty
frivolous
hey
there's
willow
and
tara
ooh
they
haven't
seen
my
new
car
hey
giles
sharp
wheels
the
rest
of
the
car's
nice
too
handles
like
a
dream
where
are
you
guys
heading
magic
shop
i
have
some
charms
on
back
order
willow
hi
hey
dawny
how's
my
favorite
chess
partner
still
leading
with
your
knight
willow's
the
awesomest
person
she's
the
only
one
i
know
who
likes
school
as
much
as
me
even
her
friends
are
cool
hey
dawn
like
tara
she
and
willow
are
both
witches
they
do
spells
and
stuff
which
is
so
much
cooler
than
slaying
i
told
mom
one
time
i
wished
they'd
teach
me
some
of
the
things
they
do
together
aand
then
she
got
really
quiet
and
made
me
go
upstairs
huh
i
guess
her
generation
isn't
cool
with
witchcraft
so
giles
and
i
worked
out
a
whole
schedule
around
school
a
block
of
time
every
day
just
to
focus
on
my
new
slayer
training
that's
a
work
ethic
buffy
you're
developing
a
work
ethic
oh
no
do
they
make
an
ointment
for
that
people
gotta
respect
a
solid
work
ethic
look
at
you
motivated
buffy
eager
to
soak
up
learning
oh
you
and
i
are
gonna
have
so
much
fun
this
semester
yeah
that
reminds
me
with
the
whole
new
training
schedule
i
kinda
had
to
drop
a
class
that's
understandable
your
slayer
studies
are
way
more
important
so
i
won't
be
taking
drama
with
you
what
you
have
to
you
promised
well
i
know
but
giles
said
that
it
just
was
the
hell
with
giles
i
can
hear
you
willow
drama
is
just
tuesday
and
thursday
afternoons
you
can
blow
off
training
tuesday
and
thursday
afternoons
can't
you
what
happened
to
people
gotta
respect
a
work
ethic
other
people
not
me
there's
a
whole
best
friend
loophole
shop's
kinda
dark
maybe

closed

odd

got
upped

bad

just
tripped
over
mr
bogarty
whawhat
is
it
is
he

doing
the
detective
thing
best
nonscoobies
like
you
and
me
stay
out
of
the
way
do
you
wanna
thumbwrestle
okay
judging
by
the
bitefest
i'd
say
it
was
more
than
one
vampire
i
make
it
four
at
least
looks
like
someone's
put
together
a
new
fang
club
well
i've
crosschecked
the
inventory
list
and
things
are
definitely
missing
mostly
books
including
a
treatise
on
the
mythology
and
methodology
of
the
vampire
slayer
oh
shoot
was
that
the
only
copy
come
on
buffy
this
could
be
very
serious
whoever's
leading
this
pack
of
vampires
appears
to
be
interested
in
learning
more
about
you
perhaps
searching
for
weaknesses
or
good
lord
what
well
i
had
no
idea
the
profit
margins
on
a
shop
like
this
were
so
high
look
at
this
uh
low
overhead
outofstate
orders
international
it's
no
wonder
there's
never
any
trouble
attracting
new
owners
a
place
like
this
is
a
virtual
deathtrap
what
well
uh
yes
there
is
that
but
uh
still
location
pedestrian
traffic
so
what's
the
next
step
buffy
you
should
begin
looking
for
their
lair
straight
away
i'll
get
riley
to
help
me
patrol
wait
aren't
you
forgetting
something
impressive
square

gotta
drop
my
sister
back
home
my
mother's

the
death
rate
keeps
the
rent
down
oh
hello
something's
been
taken
from
this
case

what'd
they
take
i

think
an
item

of
value

power
possibly
even
a
a
unicorn
10inch
ceramic
unicorn
imported
from
thailand
was
it
valuable
list
price
1295

begs
the
question

kind
of
an
unholy
creature
fancies
cheap
tasteless
statuary

poor
dawn
she
was
pretty
shaken
up
well
sure
bloody
death
and
stuff
she'll
be
okay
it's
just
i
i
think
it's
tough
for
her
not
being
able
to
well
allowed
to
you
know
help
help
oh
you
you
guys
the
slayer
circle
well
buffy
doesn't
really
need
aand
i
think
dawn's
a
little
young
ii
know
you're
right
it's
just
hard
that
outsider
feeling
tara
you're
not
an
outsider
well
yeah
i
kinda
am
no
you're
not
willow
it's
okay
where
does
this
go
somebody
making
you
feel
uncomfortable
is
it
xander
it's
xander
isn't
it
no
xander's
a
sweetie
it's
giles
it's
'cause
he's
british
and
doesn't
understand
about
stuff
it's
no
one
you
guys
all
just
have
this
really
tight
bond
it'sit's
hard
to
break
into
that
and
i'm
not
even
sure
i
want
to
i'm
sure
you're
completely
one
of
the
gang
now
everyone
accepts
that
you're
one
of
the
good
guys
maybe
i
can
talk
to
the
rest
of
the
group
and
we
can
do
something
some
kind
of
scooby
initiation
oh
maybe
we
could
wear
some
kind
of
special
ring
that
identifies
us
as
members
i
don't
think
so
but
maybe
something
like
that
would
be
nice
for
dawn
i
do
worry
about
her
sometimes
you
don't
have
to
she's
got
big
sister
buffy
happily
looking
out
for
her
so
then
my
mom
goes
off
on
me
about
how
i'm
supposed
to
watch
out
for
dawn
and
make
sure
that
she's
shielded
from
something
that
might
upset
her
like
dead
shopkeepers
she
didn't
see
him
a
foot
maybe
a
dead
foot
which
is
bad
okay
but
hello
i
see
dead
stuff
all
the
time
and
you
don't
see
mom
shielding
me
so
you
want
your
mother
to
give
you
space
to
be
a
slayer
and
shield
you
from
it
at
the
same
time
thank
you
logic
boy
did
i
mention
this
is
a
rant
sense
really
has
no
place
in
it
i'm
getting
that
what's
the
deal
buffy
you
seem
really
oh
trash
can
from
a
distance
it
looked
kinda
tense
nooo
ii
was
gonna
say
brown
squat
shadowy
uhuh
back
to
what
i
was
saying
before
we
were
rudely
attacked
by
nothing
you
seem
really
tense
yeah
there's
a
new
vampire
gang
in
town
i
mean
domestically
tense
you're
on
dawn's
case
a
lot
i
guess
it's
just
i
don't
know
it
i
know
it's
always
been
this
way
she's
the
baby
but
for
some
reason
lately
it's
just
really
getting
to
me
she's
always
around
well
yeah
you're
like
her
idol
buffy
her
idol
i
don't
think
so
unless
you
like
to
spill
things
on
your
idol's
new
leather
pants
and
you
know
what
i
mean
you
have
super
powers
and
college
a
studly
yet
sensitive
boyfriend
and
a
pesky
lifeordeath
job
that
i
can't
quit
or
even
take
a
break
from
she
doesn't
get
the
sacrifices
she's
a
kid
and
that's
what
bugs
she
gets
to
be
a
kid
and
she
acts
like
it's
the
biggest
burden
in
the
world
sometimes
i
would
like
to
just
curl
up
in
mom's
lap
and
not
worry
about
the
fate
of
the
world
i'd
like
to
be
the
one
who's
protected
who's
waited
on
hand
and
foot
getting
her
own
way
always
the
favorite
you
nut
your
mom
loves
you
both
equally
but
if
i'm
wrong
i
find
money
usually
helps
tip
the
scale
slip
joyce
a
10
or
a
20
once
in
a
while
then
we'll
see
who's
the
favorite
he
says
i'm
like
a
kid
sister
here
comes
the
judge
but
sometimes
when
he
looks
at
me
i
feel
like
he
sees
me
as
i
am
as
a
woman
oh
crap
look
at
this
now
i'm
burdened
with
a
husband
and
several
tiny
pink
children
more
cash
than
i
can
reasonably
manage
that
means
you're
winning
really
yes
cash
equals
good
ooh
i'm
so
pleased
can
i
trade
in
the
children
for
more
cash

my
reaction

sorry

sorry
it's
just
harmony
has
minions
and
ruffles
have
ridges
uh
buffy
there's
actually
a

did
come
here

just
can't
stand
the
fact
that
i'm
my
own
person
now
there
comes
a
time
in
every
woman's
life
when
she
realizes
she
needs
to
take
the
next
step
i've
taken
it
i've
found
the
real
me
and
i
like
her

plan

one
of
her
friends

'em
as
bait
lead
her
into
a
trap
that
sort
of
thing
no
much
much
better
one
i'm
not
gonna
tell
you
thought
as
much
best
of
luck
let
me
know
how
this
archvillain
thing
works
out
for
you
i'll
do
that
and
after
buffy
is
gone
i'm
gonna
kill
everybody
in
this
town
that
was
ever
mean
to
me
spike
guys
new
plan
that's
a
lot
of
weapons
for
somebody
you
weren't
sweating
twenty
minutes
ago
well
that
was
before
dawn
gave
harmony
a
backstage
pass
to
kill
us
all
in
our
sleep
buff
i
left
word
with
willow
she'll
come
do
a
return
engagement
of
her
uninvitation
spell
she
probably
still
has
the
stuff
from
last
week
and
bang
boom
you're
back
in
the
fortress
of
solitude
all
better
no
not
all
better
i
mean
it's
not
like
dawn
hasn't
grown
up
in
this
house
knowing
all
the
rules
especially
the
biggie
numero
oneoh
do
not
invite
bloodsucking
dead
people
into
our
house
i
mean
please
i
would
never
have
harmony
over
even
when
she
was
alive
people
slip
buffy
your
mom
did
she
invited
in
the
mas
dracula
in
for
coffee
well
that
was
different
i
mean
she
he
would
she
was
lonely
and
and
and
she
didn't
know
he
was
a
vampire
the
vampire
meanwhile
dawn
knew
exactly
what
harmony
was
and
she
rolled
out
the
welcome
mat
for
her
she's
just
a
kid
you
know
will
everybody
please
stop
saying
that
i
was
just
a
kid
when
i
met
my
first
vampire
but
somehow
i
still
managed
to
remember
the
rules
you
had
to
it
was
your
job
no
no
it
was
common
sense
but
nobody
expects
even
that
much
from
dawn
do
they
no
she
has
to
be
protected
and
coddled
from
the
big
bad
world
well
you
know
what
we
are
doing
nothing
but
turning
her
into
a
little
idiot
who
is
going
to
get
us
all
killed
she
just
has
to
be
more
careful
now
i
can't
be
there
to
protect
her
24
hours
a
day
ii
just
can't
hey
don't
dawn
what
do
you
think
you're
doing
leave
me
alone
i
will
after
you
come
back
inside
the
house
let
go
of
me
no
it's
not
safe
out
here
you
got
that
right
anya
oh
vampires
took
this
head
wound
looks
bad
we
gotta
get
her
to
the
hospital
they
took
her
shh
shh
dawn
dawn
whawhat
about
dawn
she
ran
out
they
took
her
vampires
oh
god
oh
god
uh
take
care
of
anya
buffy
all
right
once
again
nice
work
minionators
i'm
really
really
proud
of
you
guys
ah
mort
i
trust
you
made
our
guest
comfortable
you
told
me
to
chain
her
to
a
wall
yeah
i
know
i'm
being
you
know
sarcastic
or
whatever
anyway
i'm
feeling
really
good
about
this
new
plan
people
i
think
it's
a
winner
when
do
we
eat
the
girl
we
don't
not
yet
why
not
because
that's
not
the
plan
do
i
have
to
go
over
the
plan
again
we
use
the
sister
as
bait
we
send
buffy
a
note
more
notes
we
send
buffy
a
note
telling
her
that
if
she
wants
to
see
her
sister
again
she
has
to
come
alone
to
a
place
we
choose
she
comes
we
jump
her
we
kill
her
so
it
doesn't
really
matter
if
we're
actually
holding
the
slayer's
sister
just
as
long
as
she
thinks
we
are
she'll
walk
into
the
trap
i
guess
so
it
won't
make
any
difference
if
we
eat
the
girl
now
we're
not
eating
the
girl
why
not
cause
that's
not
the
plan
bollocks
gonna
have
to
pinch
one
of
those
satellite
dishes
well
speaking
of
dishes
to
what
do
i
owe
this
unpleasant
ow
bloody
hell
i
don't
have
time
for
banter
spike
where's
harmony's
lair
haven't
seen
her
in
months
how
should
i
know
ow
where
is
she
at
least
lay
off
the
nose
okay
okay
used
to
have
a
cave
in
the
north
woods
about
forty
meters
past
the
overpass
construction
site
ow
i
was
telling
you
the
truth
i
know
they
don't
respect
me
they
pretend
they
do
but
deep
down
they
think
i'm
nothing
i
mean
i'm
the
one
who
put
this
group
together
me
but
they
treat
me
like
i
don't
even
matter
do
you
have
any
idea
what
that
feels
like
a
little
they
have
no
idea
how
much
pressure
i'm
under
i
have
to
make
all
the
hard
decisions
and
it's
hard
excuse
me
i
didn't
hear
anybody
knock
we've
been
talking
it
over
and
we
decided
we
don't
like
this
plan
except
for
brad
he
abstained
oh
really
you
have
a
plan
you
like
better
we're
gonna
feed
on
the
girl
and
kill
you
maybe
not
in
that
order
i
don't
think
i
like
your
attitude
mort
kill
him
for
me
all
right
you're
all
on
my
list
ththis
isn't
fair
okay
so
things
haven't
been
perfect
i
just
need
a
little
more
time
to
grow
into
my
leadership
role
time's
up
touch
me
and
my
sister's
gonna
kill
you
can't
say
she
didn't
warn
him
and
you
didn't
like
the
plan
dawn
close
your
eyes
so
slayer
at
last
we
meet
we've
met
harmony
you
halfwit
i'm
the
halfwit
um
excuse
me
but
look
who's
fallen
into
my
trap
harmony
when
you
tried
to
be
head
cheerleader
you
were
bad
when
you
tried
to
chair
the
homecoming
committee
you
were
really
bad
but
when
you
try
to
be
bad
you
suck
buffy
watch
out
ooh
good
shot
mort
i
think
you
got
her
on
the
you
are
going
to
be
in
so
much
trouble
when
we
get
home
yeah
well
i'm
telling
mom
you
slayed
in
front
of
me
fine
i'll
just
tell
her
that
you
ran
out
of
the
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
that
you
got
anya
hurt
invited
a
vampire
in
got
kidnapped
sorry
it
ran
so
late
everything
uh
go
okay
yeah
yeah
you
know
i
got
the
vamps
and
we
watched
some
tv
well
i
know
at
least
one
of
us
who's
supposed
to
be
in
bed
by
now
night
so
how
was
the
exhibit
oh
it
was
fantastic
buffy
probably
would've
gotten
in
way
more
trouble
than
me
anyway
but
i
guess
it
was
pretty
okay
of
her
not
to
say
anything
to
mom
anya's
gonna
be
okay
and
xander
wasn't
mad
at
me
so
stuff
mostly
worked
out
giles
are
you
sure
about
this
why
wouldn't
i
be
well
aside
from
the
fact
that
most
magic
shop
owners
in
sunnydale
have
the
life
expectancy
of
a
spinal
tap
drummer
and
have
you
ever
run
a
store
before
i
was
a
librarian
for
years
this
is
exactly
the
same
except
people
pay
for
the
things
they
don't
return
it'll
give
me
focus
increase
my
resources
and
it'll
prevent
you
lot
from
trampling
all
over
my
flat
at
all
hours
there
may
even
be
some
space
for
you
to
train
in
the
back
boy
you've
really
thought
this
through
how
bored
were
you
last
year
i
watched
passions
with
spike
let
us
never
speak
of
it
don't
break
anything
just
don't
touch
anything
not
that
buffy's
really
changed
at
all
like
she
ever
would
what
you're
doing
right
now
not
moving
good
keep
doing
that
she
still
thinks
i'm
little
miss
nobody
just
her
dumb
little
sister
boy
is
she
in
for
a
surprise
