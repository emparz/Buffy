you
see
buffy
the
thing
you
gotta
learn
about
the
palace
and
this
takes
a
while
is
that
job
security
all
boils
down
to
one
simple
thing
politics
now
i'm
not
a
political
animal
but
you
learn
fast
around
here
or
it's
wham
hello
glass
ceiling
i
mean
it's
not
like
we
work
at
burger
world
or
the
happy
bun
where
the
power
structure
is
simple
no
here
at
the
palace
you
gotta
keep
your
friends
close
but
your
enemies
closer
it's
like
machiavelli

spend
the
rest
of
my
life
cleaning
grease
traps

forget
to
lock

the
gum

the
double
sweet
oh
it's
hard
to

when

meat

oh
why
can't
i
get
this
stupid
jingle
out
of
my
head
least
of
your
problems
now
little
girl
wait
ooookay
okay
let's
do
this
quickly
what's
that
smell
geez
slayer
is
that
you
i've
been
working
where
in
a
slaughterhouse
double
meat
palace
ohhh
you
know
what
let's
just
call
it
a
night
if
it's
all
the
same
to
you
and
you've
been
eating
that
stuff
i'm
not
so
sure
i
wanna
bite
you
you're
dead
you
smell
like
it
how
do
you
get
to
say
i'm
the
one
who's
stinky
really
it's
it's
cool
i'll
just
catch
you
next
time
oh
for
pete's
sake
spike
ah
it's
a
fair
cop
you
caught
me
slayer
however
in
all
honesty
i
think
we
have
to
say
this
one
doesn't
count
after
all
i
wasn't
exactly
hiding
no
spike
no
what
kind
of
answer
is
that
you
haven't
even
heard
the
question
yet
i
don't
have
to
we
both
know
what
you're
thinking
and
we
both
know
that
i'm
not
the
only
one
thinking
it
no
not
here
why
not
dawn
she's
inside
waiting
for
dinner
she's
counting
on
me
i'm
not
letting
her
down
by
letting
you
in
so
it's
the
fear
of
getting
caught
then
is
it
reason
number
one
on
a
very
long
list
needn't
be
an
obstacle
spike
i
mean
it
come
on
i
hear
you're
serious
so
am
i
i
want
you

for
you

extra
jetpack
for
a

out
of

go
together
we're
not
hauling
any
gear
just
be
you

i
was
never
big
on

meet
sam
sam
buffy
pleasure
demon
mine

special
one
how
long

the
time

she
caught
up
to
us
a
hell
of
a
lot
faster
than
i

guessed
possible
she
does
that
so
youyou

this
often
you
know
the
whole
husbandandwife
tagteam
demon

what
brought
us
together

almost
feel

the
suvolte

mission
accomplished
she
killed
it

have
been
tracking
this
thing
as

to
mention
that
this
was
a
homing
operation
but
it's
nice
to
finally
meet
you
by
the
way
knife
what
is
a
homing
operation
it's
my
fault
i
should
have
explained
that
would
have
saved
me
some
trouble
damn
we're
too
late
finn
how
could
you
recruit
the
slayer
without
filling
her
in
on
the
objective
that'd
be
my
question
if
we
weren't
under
severe
time
constraints
i'd
seriously
think
about
ripping
you
a
new
one
stand
down
soldier
he's
your
boss
too
oh
he
wishes
we
better
regroup
buffy
i
hate
to
impose
further
but
you
got
a
safe
house

i
have
a
house
ii
think
it's
safe
sometimes
you
can't
even
leave
i
know
the
way
and
i'll
fill
you
in
on
everything
sorry
the
place
is
such
a
mess
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
give
it
a
good
cleaning
hey
agent
finn
returns
dawn

at
you

grew
a
foot
and
a
half
a
lot
can
happen
in
a
year
well
it's
good
to
see
you

the
man
life
taker
heartbreaker
you
know
figuratively
speaking
xander
sam
willow
hi
hi
we
got
your
call
we're
here
to
help
just
like
old
times
except
with
you
being
all
big
with
the
married
life
hear
you're
getting
hitched
yourself
believe
me
you're
gonna
love
it
congratulations
really
both
of
you
just
so
you
know
i'm
prepared
to
hate
this
woman
any
way
you
want
thanks
but
no
i
don't
wanna
seem
all
petty
well
that's
the
beauty
you
can't
but
i
can
please
let
me
carry
the
hate
for
the
both
of
us
go
nuts
so
what
brings
you
back
to
town
after
you
left
suddenly
with
no
word
sam
and
i
have
been
tracking
a
suvolte
demon
through
central
america
killing
machine
nearly
mature
yeah
three
months
old
and
growing
fast
these
things
start
to
kill
the
minute
they're
hatched
and
leave
a
real
clear
trail
yeah
just
follow
the
villages
with
nothing
in
them
but
body
parts
uh
dawn
are
you
sure
you
wanna
be
around
hearing
all
this
oh
come
on
finn
she
looks
all
grownup
to
me
that
is
if
it's
all
right
with
you
uh
sure
yeah
it's
fine
so
this
demon
shredded
your
guys
and
now
you're
looking
for
a
little
payback
no
it
came
here
to
the
hellmouth
to
to
spawn
but
we
think
it
already
hatched
its
eggs
somewhere
and
the
plan
was
to
track
it
let
the
demon
take
us
to
its
nest
and
now
they're
gonna
hatch
a
bunch
of
baby
demon
things
unless
we
stop
it
which
means
we
have
to
find
the
nest
and
fast
before
sunnydale
turns
into
the
trouble
meat
palace
i
wish
i'd
said
something
else
okay
so
we
track
down
the
demon
find
the
nest
mr
and
mrs
finn
here
make
with
the
killin'
and
everyone
goes
home
happy
but
seriously
married
man
if
forced
to
choose
between
a
photographer
and
place
settings
we
can't
track
the
demon
i
killed
it
so
who's
hungry
we
got
uh
ice
cubes
all
you
can
eat
buffy
it's
good
that
you

the
suvolte

breaks
the
ice
and
when

i
like
it
so
demon
eggs
any
timetable
on
when
they're
gonna
hatch
hatching's
not
the
problem
we
think
they're
gonna
be
sold
on
the
black
market
there
are
some
foreign
military
powers
that
would
love
to
have
their
own
suvolte
you
could
never
train
it
but
drop
it
on
an
urban
population
and
it
cleanses
the
area
is
that
a
nice
way
of
saying
it
kills
people
lots
of
'em
money's
been
exchanged
there's
a
dealer
in
town

himself

the
doctor

locating

nothing
left
i've
never
met
anyone
with
enough
strength
to
quit

you
i
gotta
tell
you

a
little
bit
intimidated

patrolling
with
the
real
live
slayer

like
santa
claus
or
buddha
or
something
fat
and
jolly
legendary
and
it's
not
just
slayer
status
i'm
talking
about
it's
you
riley
talks
about
me
he
didn't
say
anything
for
a
long
time
but
i
could
tell
he
was
ripped
up
inside
good
thing
he
has
you
more
like
miraculous
i
went
down
to
central
america
with
the
peace
corps
one
night
my
entire
infirmary

by
i
didn't
know
what
they
were
i
got
saved
quit
the
corps
joined
the
squad
my
first
firefight
i
met
riley
we
started
talking
you
know
first
about
tactics
missions
stuff
like
that
and
then
about
you
he
thinks
i
let
him
go
do

i
wish
things
were
different
ii'm
not
trying

i
don't
uh
you
know
i
didn't
mean
to
put
you
on
the
spot
buffy
there's
no
bad
guys
in
this
one
the
only
thing
that
could
help
riley
work
it
out
was
time
lots
of
time
took
him
a
year
to
get
over
you
i'm
glad
he's
over
me
so
you
seeing
anyone
new
someone
special
you

i
just
take
my
time
you
know
i
don't
i
don't
wanna
jump
right
into
anything
don't
wanna
you
know
be
defined
by
who
i'm
with
yeah
better
no
guy
than
the
wrong
guy
that's
for
sure
sam
you
know
what
um
i
think
we
should
split
up
oh
i'm
slowing
you
down
i
knew
i
would
this
was
just
selfish
of
me
no
it's

guy
uh
an
informant
but
he's
twitchy
i
show
up
with
company

and
we
get
nothing
cool
i'm
guessing
finn
needs
me
about
now
he's
probably
off
somewhere
gettin'
his
ass
kicked
you
know
how
wild
he
gets
don't

little
thing
for
me
even

very
distracting
now

must
be
those

taking
this
place
apart
until
i
find
that
nest
over
my
dead
body
i've
seen
enough
of
your
dead
body
for
one
night
thanks
well
you're
not
gonna
you
coming
oh
this
is
unconstitutional
is
what
it
is
here
there's
nothin'
to
see
down
there
riley
look
i'm
not
saying
that
he's
good
okay
i'm
just
saying
that
he's
not
capable
of
something
as
i
can
explain
we're
gonna
need
more
weapons
spike
screwed
up
you
didn't
keep
'em
frozen
did
you
doctor
you
can
stop
calling
me
that
any
time
if
i
may
the
thing
of
it
is
i'm
holding
these
for
a
friend
who
no
more
games
well
that's
bloody
funny
coming
from
you
no
more
games
that's
all
you've
ever
done
is
play
me
you
keep
playing
with
rules
you
make
up
as
you
like
you
know
what
i
am
you've
always
known
you
come
to
me
all
the
same
can
you
shut
him
up
not
so
far
you
better
get
outta
here
on
second
thought
stick
around
riley
i
aim
high
plenty
of
lead
i'm
not
exactly
gun
girl
you
wanna
live
learn
fast
these
things
never
useful
we
have
to
pull
out
we
need
a
way
to
contain
these
things
riley
get
down
you
know
if
you
love
riley
finn
so
much
maybe
you
should
just
marry
him
he's
taken
and
that's
not
the
point
so
you
think
that
their
marriage
is
better
than
ours
is
that
it
no
but
granted
i
have
a
hard
time
imagining
nick
and
nora
fury
hiding
out
from
their
own
relatives
in
the
bathroom
and
i
have
no
idea
what
riley
and
mrs
riley's
wedding
was
like
well
you
haven't
shut
up
about
them
well
they
have
a
great
marriage
and
it
bummed
buffy
out
but
i
can
see
it
and
anya
i
really
have
no
clue
what
their
wedding
was
like
so
our
wedding
is
not
our
marriage
separate
things
one
fills
me
with
a
dread
akin
to
public
speaking
engagements
and
that
would
be
the
wedding
which
will
be
over
soon
but
our
marriage
that
lasts
forever
ah
well
that
works
out
nicely
then
so
are
you
and
sam
headed
back
to
central
america
or
is
that
classified
nepal
sounds
fun
i'll
send
you
a
postcard
buffy
riley
by
mission
parameters
i'm
done
here
but
i
have
authorization
to
take
the
doctor
out
do
you
want
me
to
do
that
do
i
want
you
to
how
can
you
ask
me
i'm
sleeping
with
hihim
i'm
sleeping
with
spike
i
had
actually
noticed
that
and
then
you
come
back
and
did
you
wait
until
your
life
was
absolutely
perfect
and
then
send
that
demon
here
so
you
could
throw
it
in
my
face
look
you
think
this
was
easy
for
me
yeah
i
think
it
was
a
rollicking
adventure
fun
for
the
whole
family
i
was
terrified
about
seeing
you
again
well
i'm
sure
my
incredible
patheticness
softened
the
blow
for
you
i
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about
riley
please
don't
patronize
hey
you
want
me
to
say
that
i
liked
seeing
you
in
bed
with
that
idiot
or
that
blinding
orange
is
your
very
best
color
or
that
that
burger
smell
is
appealing
you
smelled
the
smell
buffy
none
of
that
means
anything
it
doesn't
touch
you
you're
still
the
first
woman
i
ever
loved
and
the
strongest
woman
i've
ever
known
and
i'm
not
advertising
this
to
the
missus
but
you're
still
quite
the
hottie
you
know
it
goes
away
after
many
bathings
this
isn't
about
who's
on
top
i
know
how
lucky
i
am
right
now
i
love
my
work
and
i
love
my
wife
i
know
and
i
kinda
love
her
too
so
you're
not
in
the
greatest
place
right
now
and
maybe
i
made
it
worse
no
wheel
never
stops
turning
buffy
you're
up
you're
down
it
doesn't
change
what
you
are
and
you
are
a
hell
of
a
woman
riley
that
night
i
never
got
the
chance
to
tell
you
how
sorry
i
was
about
what
happened
between
us
and
you
never
have
to
well
the
wedding
itself
was
held
in
a
military
chopper
just
before
a
hairy
night
drop
into
hostile
territory
huh
and
just
curious
what's
a
chopper
rental
run
these
days
oh
well
actually
we
commandeered
it
from
a
local
guerilla
squad
so
cheap
oh
yeah
you
have
my
email
you
promise
you'll
keep
in
touch
you
won't
get
traced
i
don't
wanna
lead
the
bad
guys
to
your
location
by
mistake
our
line's
secure
oh
huh
duh
of
course
it
is
i
keep
thinking
of
you
like
regular
people
but
no
you're
not
oh
right
like
demonhunting
is
all
exotic
to
a
girl
from
sunnydale
so
you
gonna
say
goodbye
this
time
or
just
split
all
secretagenty
like
last
time

i
warrant
a
hug
goodbye
dawn
i
thought
it
would
suck
less
this
time
it
doesn't
it
was
really
nice
meeting
you
all
you
ready
for
nepal
agent
soldier
firefights
bug

could
use
a
break
bye

riley
bye
sam
what
a
bitch
so
she's
back
thought
you'd
be
off
snogging
with
soldierboy
he's
gone
so
you
come
for
a
bit
of
cold
comfort
the
bed's
a
bit
blown
up
but
then
that
was
never
our
i'm
not
here
to
and
i'm
not
here
to
bust
your
chops
about
your
stupid
scheme
either
that's
just
you
i
should
have
remembered
so
this
is
worse
then
is
it
this
is
you
telling
me
it's
over
i've
memorized
this
tune
luv

i
have
the
sheet
music

change
what
you
want
i
know
that
i
do
want
you

makes
things
simpler
for
a
little
while
i
don't
call
five
hours
straight
a
little
while
i'm
using
you
i
can't
love
you
i'm
just
being
weak
and
selfish
really
not
complaining
here
and
it's
killing
me
i
have
to
be
strong
about
this
i'm
sorry
william
