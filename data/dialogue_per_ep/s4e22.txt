anything
on
me
i

graham
and
a
lot
of
the

alive
i
might
actually
get
out
of
this
with
an
honorable
discharge
in
return
for
your
silence
no
doubt
oh
yeah
having
the
inside
scoop
on
the
administration's
own
bay
of
mutated
pigs
is
definitely
an
advantage
it's
like
you're
blackmailing
the
government
in
a
patriotic
way
i'll
call
you
when
it's
over
dinner
is
served
and
my
very
own
recipe

a
spell
by

this
exciting
our
first
production
i
can't
wait
till
our
scene
i
love
you
oh
don't
step
on
my
cues
production
ohmigod
the
place
is
packed
everybody's
here
your
whole
family's
in
the
front
row
and
they
look
really
angry
there's
a
production
oh
somebody's
got
stage
fright
isn't
this
the
first
class
well
you
showed
up
late
or
you'd
have
a
better
part
i'm
cowboy
guy
your
costume
is
perfect
nobody's
gonna
know
the
truth
you
know
about
you
costume
you're
already
in
character
oh
i
shoulda
done
that
but
how
come
there's
i
mean
i
was
given
to
understand
that
a
drama
class
would
have
you
know
drama
class
i
mean
we
haven't
even
rehearsed
well
maybe
some
people
haven't
i
showed
up
on
time
so
i
got
to
be
cowboy
guy
i
just
think
it's
really
early
to
be
putting
on
a
play
i
i
don't
even
know
what
this
isn't
madame
butterfly
is
it
because
i
have
a
whole
problem
with
opera
all
right
everyone
pay
attention
in
just
a
few
moments
that
curtain
is
going
to
open
on
our
very
first
production
now
everyone
that
willow's
ever
met
is
out
in
that
audience
including
all
of
us
that
means
we
have
to
be
perfect
stay
in
character
remember
your
lines
and
energy
energy
energy
especially
in
the
musical
numbers
did
anyone
see
that
acting
is
not
about
behaving
it's
about
hiding
the
audience
wants
to
find
you
strip
you
naked
and
eat
you
alive
so
hide
stop
that
now
costumes
sets
um
the
things
that
you
uh
you
know
uh
you
um
shot
from
above
we
see
the
cast
gathered
harmony
still
jumping
up
behind
giles
trying
to
bite
him
you
hold
them
you
touch
them
uh
use
them
um
props
no
props
yes
it's
all
about
subterfuge
that's
very
annoying
now
go
on
out
there
lie
like
dogs
and
have
a
wonderful
time
now
if
we
can
stay
in
focus
keep
our
heads
and
if
willow
can
stop
stepping
on
everyone's
cues
i
know
this'll
be
the
best
production
of
death
of
a
salesman
we've
ever
done
stop
it
good
luck
everyone
break
a
leg
i've
made
a
little
space
for
the
cheese
slices
things
aren't
going
very
well
no
this
drama
class
is

i
think
they're

the
proper
way

whole
family's

time
a
bunch
of
you
were
sitting
there
waiting
to
be
shepherded
i
remember
it
smelled
like
dead
flowers
like
decay
then
it
hit
me

hope
of
our

future

a
bunch
of
mulch

the
chance

you
haven't
got
the
heart
you
have
to
stop
thinking
let
it
wash
over
you
don't
you
think
it's
a
little
oldfashioned
this
is
the
way
women
and
men
have
behaved
since
the
beginning
before
time
now
look
into
the
light
come
on
come
on
we're
gonna
miss
all
the
good
stuff
does
she
always
want
to
train
this
badly
well
it
appears
she's
never
heard
the
fable
about
patience
which
one
is
that
the
the
one
about
the
fox
and
the
uh
less
patient
fox
here
i
want

i
want
to
yes

am
a
vampire
buffy

a
sacred
birthright

elbow

a
vampire

me
i
haven't
got
any
treats
for
god's
sake
rupert
go
easy
on
the
girl
this
is
my
business
blood
of
the
lamb
and
all
that
oh
now
you're
gonna
get
that
all
over
your
face
i
know
you
hey
come
on
you're
gonna
miss
everything
don't
push
me
around
you
know
i
have
a
great
deal
to
do
i've
hired
myself
out
as
an
attraction
sideshow
freak
well
at
least
it's
showbiz
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
with
all
of
this
you
gotta
make
up
your
mind
rupes
what
are
you
wasting
your
time
for
haven't
you
figured
it
all
out
yet
with
your
enormous
squishy
frontal
lobes
i
still
think
buffy
should
have
killed
you
i
wear
the
cheese
it
does
not
wear
me
honestly
you
meet
the
most
appalling
sorts
of
people
he
walks
on
in
the
background
we
see
spike
still
in
jesus
pose
more
flashbulbs
going
off
i'm
so
sorry
i'm
late
there's
a
great
deal
going
on
and
all
at
once
don't
we
know
it
only
at
death's
door
over
here
look
at
xander
got
the
sucking
chest
wound
swingin'
i
promised
anya
i'd
be
there
for
her
big
night
now
i'll
probably
be
pushing
up
daisies
in
the
sense
of
being
in
the
ground
underneath
them
and
fertilizing
the
soil
with
decomposition
okay
a
man
walks
into
the
office
of
a
doctor
he's
wearing
on
his
head
um
wait
there's
there's
a
there's
a
duck
is
that
right
you
suck
quiet
you'll
miss
the
humorous
conclusion
she's
doing
quite
well
do
you
know
this
is
your
fault
we
have
to
think
of
the
facts
willow
i'm
very
busy
i
have
a
gig
myself
you
know
something's
after
us
it's
uh
like
some
primal
some
animal
force
that
used
to
be
us
don't
get
linear
on
me
now
man
and
then
the
duck
tells
the
doctor
that
there's
a
man
that's
attached
to
my
ass
see
it
was
the
duck
and
not
the
man
that
spoke
rupert
you've
gotta
focus
you
must
have
some
kind
of
explanation
if
we
don't
know
what
we're
fighting
i
don't
think
we
stand
a
chance
it's
strange
it's
not
like
anything
we've
faced
before
it
seems
familiar
somehow
of
course
the
spell
we
cast
with
buffy
must
have
released
some
primal
evil
that's
come
back
seeking
i'm
not
sure
what
willow
look
through
the
chronicles
for
some
reference
to
a
warrior
beast
i've
got
to
warn
buffy
there's
every
chance
she
might
be
next
xander
help
willow
and
try
not
to
bleed
on
my
couch
i've
just
had
it
steamcleaned
no
wait
well
that
was
obvious
i
know
who
you
are
and
i
can
defeat
you
with
my
intellect
i
can
cripple
you
with
my
thoughts
of
course
you
underestimate
me
you
couldn't
know
you
never
had
a
watcher
buffy
wake
up
buffy
you
have
to
wake
up
right
away
i'm
not
really
in
charge
of
these
things
please
wake
up
oh
please
i
need
my
beauty
sleep
so
stop
it
okay
faith
and
i
just
made
that
bed
for
who
i
thought

tell
me

guys
aren't
here
are
they
we
were
gonna
hang
out
and
watch
movies

no
i
think
they
need
me
to
find
them
it's
so
late
oh
that
clock's
completely
wrong
here
i'm
never
gonna
use
those
you
think
you
know
what's
to
come
what
you
are
you
haven't
even
begun
i
think
i
need
to
go
find
the
others
have
you
seen
my
friends
they
wouldn't
just
disappear
mom
oh
hi
honey
why
are
you
living
in
the
walls
oh
sweetie
no
i'm
fine
here
don't
worry
about
me
it
looks
dirty
well
it
seems
that
way
to
you
i
made
some
lemonade
and
i'm
learning
how
to
play
mahjong
you
go
find
your
friends
i
i
think
they
might
be
in
danger
ii'm
sorry
dear
um
a
mouse
is
playing
with
my
knees
i
i
really
don't
think
you
should
live
in
there
well
you
could
probably
break
through
the
wall
hey
there
killer
riley
you're
back
i
never
left
but
how
did
the
debriefing
go
i
told
you
not
to
worry
about
that
it
went
great
they
made
me
surgeon
general
why
didn't
you
come
and
tell
me
we
could
have
celebrated
oh
we're
drawing
up
a
plan
for
world
domination
the
key
element
coffeemakers
that
think
world
domination
iis
that
a
good
baby
we're
the
government
it's
what
we
do
she's
uncomfortable
with
certain
concepts
it's
understandable
aggression
is
a
natural
human
tendency
though
you
and
me
come
by
it
another
way
we're
not
demons
is
that
a
fact
buffy
we've
got
important
work
here
a
lot
of
filing
giving
things
names
what
was
yours
before
adam
not
a
man
among
us
can
remember
the
demons
have
escaped
please
run
for
your
lives
this
could
be
trouble
we
better
make
a
fort
i'll
get
some
pillows
wait
i
have
weapons
thought
you
were
looking
for
your
friends
okay
killer
if
that's
the
way
you
want
it
i
guess
you're
on
your
own
i'm
never
gonna
find
them
here
of
course
not
that's
the
reason
you
came
you're
not
in
my
dream
i
was
borrowed
someone
has
to
speak
for
her
let
her
speak
for
herself
that's
what's
done
in
polite
circles
why
do
you
follow
me
i
don't
where
are
my
friends
you're
asking
the
wrong
questions
make
her
speak
i
have
no
speech
no
name
i
live
in
the
action
of
death
the
blood
cry
the
penetrating
wound
i
am
destruction
absolute
alone
the
slayer
the
first
i
am
not
alone
the
slayer
does
not
walk
in
this
world
i
walk
i
talk
i
shop
i
sneeze
i'm
gonna
be
a
fireman
when
the
floods
roll
back
there's
trees
in
the
desert
since
you
moved
out
and
i
don't
sleep
on
a
bed
of
bones
now
give
me
back
my
friends
no
friends
just
the
kill
we
are
alone
that's
it
i'm
waking
up
it's
over
we
don't
do
this
any
more
enough
are
you
quite
finished
it's
over
okay
i'm
going
to
ignore
you
and
you're
going
to
go
away
you're
really
gonna
have
to
get
over
the
whole
primal
power
thing
you're
not
the
source
of
me
also
in
terms
of
hair
care
you
really
wanna
say
what
kind
of
impression
am
i
making
in
the
workplace
'cause
the
first
slayer
wow
not
big
with
the
socialization
or
the
floss
somehow
our
joining
with
buffy
and
invoking
the
essence
of
the
the
slayer's
power
was
an
affront
to
the
source
of
that
power
you
know
you
could
have
brought
that
up
to
us
before
we
did
it
i
did
i
said
there
could
be
dire
consequences
yes
but
you
say
that
about
chewing
too
fast
i'm
uh
guessing
i
missed
some
fun
the
spirit
of
the
first
slayer
tried
to
kill
us
in
our
dreams
oh
you
want
some
hot
chocolate
xander
yes
what
joyce
uh
buffy's
mom
be
my
kitchen
buddy
again
help
me
carry
yes
sure
buffy's
mom
you
all
right
yeah
i
think
i
might
jump
in
the
shower
you
seem
a
bit
uh
a
little
the
first
slayer
i
never
really
thought
about
it
it
was
intense
ii
guess
you
guys
got
a
taste
of
that
huh
yeah
from
now
on
you
keep
your
slayer
friends
out
of
my
dreams
is
that
clear
it's
not
good
for
the
sleepin'
ah
well
at
least
you
all
didn't
dream
about
that
guy
with
the
cheese
i
don't
know
where
the
hell
that
came
from
you
think
you
know
what's
to
come
what
you
are
you
haven't
even
begun
