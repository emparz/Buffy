came
from
where
i'm
gonna
rain

more
supersized
portions
of
slaughter
mayhem
and
bloodshed
than
any
of
you
scabs
can
even
dream
about
so
how
come
i
ain't
happy
got
everything
i
ever
wanted
still
something's
off
i
don't
know
what
do
you
think
better
part
of
a
century
spent
in
delinquency
just
paid

hotwired
ben's
auto
who's
for
gettin'
the
hell
out
of
here
all
in
favor
let's
do
it
you
good
to
go
oh

buffy
the
same
still
it's
been
almost
a
half
an
hour
the
slayer's
gonna
be
all
right
won't
she
you
should
try
it
again
will
all
right
but
i'm
not
even

you
know
really
in
there
try
can
you
hear
me
buffy
buffy
buffy
buffy
she
can't
just
be
braindead
i

still
buffy
somewhere
in
there
right
spike
come
on
we're
not
gonna
get
dawn
back
by
sittin'
around
here
you're
not
gonna
get
dawn
back
any
way
you
slice
it
harris
it's
for
buffy
to
decide
good
panic
that
oughta
help
we
should
move
her
uunless
we
shouldn't
should
we
couldn't
that
make
it
worse
i
think
i
read
that
somewhere
i
am
so
large
with
not
knowing
it's
impossible
to
know
for
sure
losing
dawn
after
all
that
buffy's
been
through
i
think
it's
pushed
her
too
far
into
some
sort
of
catatonia
you
don't
need
a
diploma
to
see
that
snap
her
out
of
it
buffy
oi
rise
and
shine
love
spike
come
on
people
girl's
endowed
with
slayer
strength
it's
hardly
the
time
to
get
dainty
buffy
we
tried
that
ow
we
didn't
try
that
are
you
insane
we
could
be
dealing
with
neurological
damage
here
you
want
to
kill
her
we
have
to
do
something
i
can't
just
sit
here
watching
you
waste
time
with
kid
gloves
i'm
willing
to
wager
when
all
is
said
and
done
buffy
likes
it
rough
separate
buffy's
out
glory
has
dawn
sometime
real
soon
she's
gonna
use
dawn
to
tear
down
the
barrier
between
every
dimension
there
is
so
if
you
two
wanna
fight
do
it
after
the
world
ends
okay
all
right
first
we
head
back
to
sunnydale
xander'll
take
giles
to
a
hospital
anya's
looking
after
tara
and
spike
you
find
glory
check
her
apartment
see
if
she's
still
there
try
anything
stupid
like
payback
and
i
will
get
very
cranky
everyone
clear
anya
um
wwhat
will
you
do
i'll
help
buffy
okay
then
the
world
is
spinning
straight
to
a
new
day
big
day
big
big
day
shh
shh
uh
will
now
uh
don't
turn
me
into
a
horned
toad
for
asking
but
what
if
we
come
across
ben
ii
don't
think
a
doctor's
what
buffy
needs
right
now
well
yeah
especially
not
one
who
also
happens
to
be
glory
what
do
you
mean
you
know
ben
is
glory
you
mean
ben's
with
glory
with
in
what
sense
they're
working
together
no
no
ben
is
glory
glory's
ben
they're
one
and
the
same
when
did
all
this
happen
not
one
hour
ago
right
here
before
your
very
eyes
ben
came
he
turned
into
glory
snatched
the
kid
and
pfft
vanished
remember
you
do
remember
is
everyone
here
very
stoned
ben
glory
he's
a
doctor
she's
the
beast
two
entirely
separate
entities
sharing
one
body
like
a
bloody
sitcom
surely
you
remember
so
you're
saying
ben
and
glory
have
a
connection
yes
obviously
but
what
kind
oh
i
get
it
that's
very
crafty
glory's
worked
the
kind
of
mojo
where
anyone
who
sees
her
little
prestochangeo
instantly
forgets
and
yours
truly
being
somewhat
other
than
human
stands
immune
so
ben
and
glory
areare
the
same
person
glory
can
turn
into
ben
and
ben
turns
back
into
glory
and
anyone
who
sees
it
instantly
forgets
kewpie
doll
for
the
lady
excellent
now
do
we
suspect
there
may
be
some
kind
of
connection
between
ben
and
glory
the
key
the
key
the
key
the
key
the
key
unbelievable
how
annoying
those
groupies
can
be
uh
they
merely
sense
that
tonight
at
last
the
dimensional
portal
shall
open
ushering
in
the
long
and
bloody
reign
of
the
great

you
recapture
your
godhood

unleash
armageddon

of
a
sudden

the
inner

it
she's
workin'
some
spell
trying
to
reach
buffy
psychically
uh
she's
gone
into
buffy's
mind
pretty
tricky
stuff
it's
extraordinarily
advanced
um
i
was
thinking
we
should
check
on
glory's
victims
while
we're
here
oh
the
mental
ward
i
already
been
the
vegetable
section's
closed
nobody

like
they
all

out
glory's
flat
looks
like
the
great
one
has
scampered
gone
to
uh
perform
her
ritual
with
dawn
and
leaving
us
entirely
clueless
not
entirely
i
know
this
bloke
well
not
so
much
a
bloke
so
much
as
a
demon
but
still
bookish
all
tuned
in
to
the
nastier
corners
of
this
our
magic
world
it's
a
bit
of
a
last
resort
really
but
still
we
might
persuade
him
to
suss
out
glory's
game
plan
sound
worthy
off
we
go
then
meet
back
at
the
shop

the
original
oneeyed
chicklet
in
the
kingdom
of
the
blind

my
gift
this
is
what
i
do
i'm
not
talking
about
this
i'm
talking
about
this
right
here
it
happened
i
know
it's
something
small
but
it's
something
what
don't
go
there
will
i'm
not
you're
the
one
who
keeps
dragging
me
back
here
aand
you
wouldn't
be
doing
that
if
you
weren't
trying
to
show
me
something
do
i
buffy
come
on
iit's
your
brain
just
tell
me
what
happened
here
this
was
when
i
quit
will
you
did
just
for
a
second
i
remember
i
was
in
the
magic
shop
i
put
a
book
back
for
giles
nothing
special
about
it
and
then
it
hit
me
what
hit
you
i
can't
beat
glory
glory's
going
to
win
you
can't
know
that
i
didn't
just
know
it
i
felt
it
glory
will
beat
me
and
in
that
second
of
knowing
it
will
i
wanted
it
to
happen
why
i
wanted
it
over
this
is
all
of
this
it's
too
much
for
me
i
just
wanted
it
over
if
glory
wins
then
dawn
dies
and
i
would
grieve
people
would
feel
sorry
for
me
but
it
would
be
over
and
i
imagined
what
a
relief
it
would
be
i
killed
dawn
is
that
what
you
think
my
thinking
it
made
it
happen
some
part
of
me
wanted
it
and
in
the
moment
glory
took
dawn
i
know
i
could
have
done
something
better
but
i
didn't
i
was
off
by
some
fraction
of
a
second
and
this
is
why
i
killed
my
sister
i
think
spike
was
right
back
at
the
gas
station
snap
out
of
it
what
what
all
this
it
has
a
name
it's
called
guilt
it's
a
feeling
and
it's
important
but
it's
not
more
than
that
buffy
buffys
you've
carried
the
weight
of
the
world
on
your
shoulders
since
high
school
and
i
i
know
you
didn't
ask
for
this
but
you
do
it
every
day
and
so
you
wanted
out
for
one
second
so
what
i
got
dawn
killed
hello
your
sister
not
dead
yet
but
she
will
be
if
you
stay
locked
inside
here
and
never
come
back
to
us
but
what
if
i
can't
then
i
guess
you're
right
and
you
did
kill
your
sister
wait
where
are
you
going
where
you're
needed
are
you
coming
buffy
she's
back
you're
okay
yeah
i'm
okay
hear
you
found
the
ritual
text
uh
something
like
that
yes
did
you
know
that
ben
is
glory
so
i'm
told
what
do
we
know
um
well
uh

according
to
these
scrolls
uh
it's
possible
for
glory
to
be
stopped
ii'm
afraid
it's
um
well
buffy
i've
read
these
things
very
carefully
and
there's
not
much
margin
for
error
you
understand
what
i'm
saying
might
help
if
you
actually
said
it
um
glory
plans
to
open
a
dimensional
portal
by
way
of
a
ritual
bloodletting
dawn's
blood
yes
once
the
blood
is
shed
at
a
certain
time
and
place
the
fabric
which
separates
all
realities
will
be
ripped
apart
dimensions
will
pour
into
one
another
uh
with
no
barriers
to
stop
them
reality
as
we
know
it
will
be
destroyed
and
chaos
will
reign
on
earth
so
how
do
we
stop
it
the
portal
will
only
close
once
the
blood
is
stopped
and
the
only
way
for
that
to
happen
is
um

buffy
the
only
way
is
to
kill
dawn
joss
whedon
