giles
you
don't
have
to
help
you
cooked
oh
come
on
i
quite
like
to
cook
helping
you
two
out
makes
me
feel
useful
wanna
clean
out
the
garage
on
saturday
you
can
feel
indispensable
hmm
how
tempting
dawn
if
there
are
any
plates
in
your
room
let's
have
them
before
they
get
furry
and
we
have
to
name
them
hey
i
was
like
five
then
how's
she
doing
and
you
i'm
okay
well
some
minutes
are
harder
than
others
i'm
so
sorry
all
i
can
say
is
iit
will
get
better
it
has
to
we're
holding
up
though
you
know
getting
into
a
routine
good
routine's
good
in
fact
i
was
thinking
that
we
might
return
to
our
training
schedule
i
don't
know
i
was
um
thinking
about
maybe
taking
a
break
or
something
just
ease
off
for
a
while
not
get
into
full
slay
mode
but
you
were
doing
so
well
aand
you
were
great
helping
me
with
everything
i'm
just
starting
to
feel
uneasy
about
stuff
stuff
training
slaying
all
of
it
it's
just
i
mean
i
can
beat
up
the
demons
until
the
cows
come
home
and
then
i
can
beat
up
the
cows
but
i'm
not
sure
i
like
what
it's
doing
to
me
but
you've
mastered
so
much
i
mean
your
strength
and
resilience
alone
yeah
strength
resilience
those
are
all
words
for
hardness
i'm
starting
to
feel
like
being
the
slayer
is
turning
me
into
stone
turning
you
into
stone
buffy
just
think
about
it
i
was
never
there
for
riley
not
like
i
was
for
angel
i
was
terrible
to
dawn
at
a
time
like
this
no
you're
bound
to
feel
emotionally
numb
before
that
riley
left
because
i
was
shut
down
he's
gone
and
now
my
mom
is
gone
and
i
loved
her
more
than
anything
and
i
don't
know
if
she
knew
oh
she
knew
always
i
don't
know
to
slay
to
kill
iit
means
being
hard
on
the
inside
maybe
being
the
perfect
slayer
means
being
too
hard
to
love
at
all
i
already
feel
like
i
can
hardly
say
the
words
buffy
giles
i
love
you
love
love
love
love
love
giles
it
feels
strange
well
i
shouldn't
wonder
how
serious
are
you
about
this
ten
i'm
serious
to
the
amount
of
ten
there
is
something
in
the
watchers'
diaries
a
quest
a
quest
like
finding
a
grail
or
something
not
a
grail
maybe
answers
it
would
take
a
day
perhaps
two
i'm
not
leaving
dawn
not
with
glory
looking
for
her
sure
you
can
what's
the
deal
some
slayers
before
buffy
found
it
helpful
in
regaining
their
focus
learning
more
about
their
role
there's
a
sacred
place
in
the
desert
it's
it's
not
far
but
i
can't
go
i'm
not
leaving
you
dawn
if
you
have
to
go
learn
i
mean
if
it'll
help
you
out
i
think
you
should
do
it
i
can
hang
with
the
gang
i'll
be
okay
i
love
you
dawn
you
know
that
right
yeah
i
love
you
too
i
love
you

really
love
you
gettin'
weird
sorry
but
it's
important
that
i
tell
you
weird
love's
better
than
no
love
some
say
it's
better'n
the
real
thing
better
than
the
real
thing
she
looks
good
but
what
about
the
rest
a
little
walk
a
little
talk
perhaps
a
zippy
cartwheel
hey
she's
uh
great
you'll
be
real
happy
i
swear
she's
got
everything
you
asked
for
all
the
extra
programming
tons
of
realworld
knowledge
the
profiles
you
gave
me
about
her
family
and
friends
all
the
extra
programming
right
ah
the
the
stuff
that
you
wanted
the
uh
scenario
responses
you
know
the
uh
uh
special
skills

all
of
it
now
you
said
that
i
could
leave
wait
i'm
not
sure
i'm
a
satisfied
customer
she
looks
a
little
shiny
to
me
you
know
uh
touch
of
plasticine
spike
oh
spike
she'll
do
he's
getting
stronger
i'm
losing
him
i'm
losing
control
of
him
you're
speaking
of
ben
most
glamorous
yet
tasteful
one
he
stabbed
you
in
your
body
jinx
is
all
right
your
highness
and
we
do
have
the
new
knowledge
that
the
key
is
a
human
being
if
time
runs
out
on
us
and
all
we're
left
with
is
info
then
we're
screwed
oh
surely
not
no
we're
screwed
but
you
are
a
god
the
sacred
glorificus
i'm
a
god
in
exile
far
from
the
hellfires
of
home
and
sharing
my
body
with
an
enemy
that
stabs
my
boys
in
their
fleshy
little
stomachs
uhh
i'm
in
pain
how
can
we
help
we'll
lay
down
our
lives
the
slayer
and
the
key
are
connected
she's
going
to
have
contact
with
it
find
out
who's
new
in
her
life
who's
special
who's
different
watch
her
we
can
do
that
o
thou
i
want
to
hear
about
everyone
she
has
contact
with
that
girl
has
my
key

and
i'm
trusting
you
boys
to
get
it
for
me
if
you
love
me

get
it
for
me
what's
in
the
trunk
supplies
supplies
i
was
wondering
about
that
like
food
water
maybe
a
compass
what
about
a
book
a
gourd
and
a
bunch
of
twigs
i
don't
think
i'll
be
that
hungry
they're
for
me
come
on
this
way
you
see
the
location
of
the
sacred
place
is
a
guarded
secret
i
can't
take
you
there
myself
i'll
have
to
perform
a
ritual
to
transfer
my
guardianship
of
you
temporarily
to
to
a
guide
this'll
do
a
guide
but
no
food
or
water
so
it
leads
me
to
the
sacred
place
and
then
a
week
later
it
leads
you
to
my
bleached
bones
buffy
please
it
takes
more
than
a
week
to
bleach
bones
so
how's
it
start
i
uh
jump
out
of
the
circle
and
then
jump
back
in
it
and
then
um

i
shake
my
gourd
i
know
this
ritual
the
ancient
shamans
were
next
called
upon
to
do
the
hokeypokey
and
turn
themselves
around
go
quest
and
that's
what
it's
all
about
what
you
searching
for
slayer
a
weak
spot
hmm
try
me
give
me
the
best
you've
got
ooh
oh
is
that
your
best
slayer
no
why
not
i
i
wanna
hurt
you
but
i
can't
resist
the
sinister
attraction
of
your
cold
and
muscular
body
maybe
i
should
repay
you
for
your
gentleness
maybe
i
should
let
you
go
no
no
spike
never
let
me
go
you
know
you
should
be
afraid
of
me
i'm
bad
you
are
you're
very
very
bad
are
you
gonna
do
it
that
way
no
this
way
you
can't
do
it
i
could
never
do
it
i'm
helpless
against
you
you
fiend
oh
buffy
hello
kitty
i
know
this
place
okay
warning
spell's
all
set
so
that's
it
we're
all
protected
up
for
the
night
well
iit's
probably
not
as
good
as
willow
could
do
she's
a
natural
with
magic
in
just
the
time
i've
known
her
she's
already
blown
right
past
me
so
when
the
whiz
kid
gets
back
from
chem
lab
can
you
have
her
you
know
bulk
up
the
spell
a
little
if
you
want
maybe
while
anya
and
i
go
do
a
quick
patrol
i
don't
see
why
we
have
to
patrol
just
'cause
buffy's
away
i'd
rather
stay
home
and
watch
television
oh
yeah
willow
wants
to
watch
this
thing
on
the
history
channel
tonight
salem
witch
trial
stuff
which
is
only
gonna
get
her
all
upset
oh
i
was
there
it
really
wasn't
that
bad
see
if
you
were
really
a
witch
you
could
do
a
spell
to
escape
so
really
it
was
only
bad
for
the
falsely
accused
and
well
they
never
have
a
good
time
no
so
guys
if
this
is
a
real
slumber
party
where's
the
pizza
you're
evil
and
that
excites
you
it
excites
me
it
terrifies
me
i
try
so
hard
to
resist
you
and
i
can't
yeah
darn
your
sinister
attraction
are
you
afraid
of
me
yes
you
know
i
can't
lie
to
you
i
think
you
can
i
think
you
can
if
i
let
you
and
i
want
to
let
you
i
want
you
to
bite
me
and
devour
me
until

xander
and

anya
how
is
your
money
fine
thank
you
for
asking
isn't
it
a
beautiful
night
for
killing
evil
things
i
guess
you're

very
early
yeah
how
was
the
whole
visionquest
experience
i
don't
understand
that
question
but
thank
you
for
asking
you're
my
friend
and
a
carpenter
are
you
all
right
you're
all
hey
wait
up
spike
it's
spike
and
he's
wearing
a
coat
yes
uh
hello
all
uh
buffy's
back
early
i
see
lots
of
patrolling
all
around
tonight
then
is
it
ow
hey
give
a
fella
a
break
there
slayer
uh
i'm
glad
you're
all
here
uh
'cause
uh
'cause
the
place
is
crawling
with
vamps
tonight
uh
tons
of
'em
i
uh
think
we
oughta
split
up
we
haven't
seen
any
vamps
are
you
sure
there's
you're
right
yep
guess
so
spike
be
careful

the
big
action
for
the
night
you
two
can
toddle
on
home
if
you
want
uh
buffy
yes
spike
and
i
will
do
it
alone
you

the
slaying

should
be
satisfied
but
i'm
not
ii'm
all

my
skin
is
all
hot
do
i
look
hot
to
you
always
you
better
feel
me
to
make
sure
i
can
do
that
i
breathed
in
like
a
quart
of
vampire
dust
that
can't
be
good
i
wish
giles
told
us
they
were
back
from
the
desert
i
wish
i
knew
what
went
on
there
oh
you
know
slayerwatcher
stuff
probably
some
silly
ritual
with
an
enchanted
prairie
dog
or
something
whatever
it
was
i
think
she's
still
a
little
spacy
she
fought
okay
yeah
hey
she
never
asked
about
dawn
that's
true
something's
wrong
i
hear
something
oh
spike
you're
the
big
bad
you're
the
big
bad
those
darn
salem
judges
with
their
lesssatanicthanthou
attitude
oh
honey
let's
change
it
the
discovery
channel
has
koala
bears
where's
dawn
she
she's
in
the
bedroom
she
fell
asleep
good
what's
goin'
on
buffy's
gone
insane
what
what'd
she
do
brace
yourself
you're
not
gonna
believe
it
everyone
before
we
jump
all
over
her
people
do
strange
things
when
someone
they
love
dies
when
i
lost
my
mother
ii
did
some
pretty
dumb
stuff
like
lying
to
my
family
and
staying
out
all
night
buffy's
boinking
spike
oh
well
tatara's
right
grief
can
be
powerful
and
we
shouldn't
judge
what
are
you
kidding
she's
nuts
well
it's
not
healthy
we're
all
agreeing
there
what
can
we
do
sometimes
in
the
movies
when
they
go
crazy
they
slap
'em
i'm
gonna
go
find
her
and
talk
to
her
if
she's
losing
it
we
gotta
help
her
before
she
gets
herself
hurt
you
aren't
really
gonna
slap
her
are
you
no
but
if
i
have
to
see
her
straddle
spike

will
definitely
knock
myself
unconscious

that
uh
down

uh
no
matter
what
don't
come
out
till

get
you
okay
okay
oh
it's
you
i
saw
you
in
the
cemetery
with
buffy
yeah
can't
see
how
it's
any
business
of
yours
it
is
my
business
because
buffy's
my
friend
and
she's
gone
through
some
stuff
lately
that
well
it's
affected
her
and
you're
taking
advantage
of
her
she's
upset
about
her
mum
and
if
she
turns
to
me
for
comfort
well
i'm
not
gonna
deny
it
to
her
i'm
not
a
monster
yes
you
are
a
monster
vampires
are
monsters
they
make
monster
movies
about
them
well
yeah
you
got
me
there
spike
buffy
has
lost
of
friends
and
we
love
her
very
much
and
we'll
do
whatever
it
takes
to
protect
her
now
if
that
means
killing
you
then
well
that's
just
a
bonus
gentlemen
i'm
so
sorry
to
intrude
but
i
wondered
if
i
might
beg
a
moment
of
your
time
friends
of
yours
guess
not
tie
his
hands
glory
will
want
him
restrained
let
me
go
careful
with
him
she
will
want
the
key
intact
key
who's
a
key
i'm
not
the
i
know
you
you're
the
first
slayer
this
is
a
form
i
am
the
guide
i
have
a
few
questions
about
being
the
slayer
what
about
love
not
just
boyfriend
love
you
think
you're
losing
your
ability
to
love
ii
didn't
say
that
yeah
you're
afraid
that
being
the
slayer
means
losing
your
humanity
does
it
you
are
full
of
love
you
love
with
all
of
your
soul
it's
brighter
than
the
fire
blinding
that's
why
you
pull
away
from
it
i'm
full
of
love
i'm
not
losing
it
only
if
you
reject
it
love
is
pain
and
the
slayer
forges
strength
from
pain
love
give
forgive
risk
the
pain
it
is
your
nature
love
will
bring
you
to
your
gift

nothin'
let's
hit
your
place
we'll
stock
up
uh
tara
can
you
stay
here
aand
watch
dawn
of
course
ii'm
sorry
i
i'm
just
a
little
confused
i'm
full
of
love
which
is
nice
and
love
will
lead
me
to
my
gift
yes
i'm
getting
a
gift
or
or
do
you
mean
that
that
i
have
a
gift
to
give
to
someone
else
death
is
your
gift
death

is
your
gift
okay
no
death
is
not
a
gift
my
mother
just
died
i
know
this
if
i
have
to
kill
demons
because
it
makes
the
world
a
better
place
then
i
kill
demons
but
it's
not
a
gift
to
anybody
your
question
has
been
answered
what
the
hell
is
that
and
why
is
his
hair
that
color
stunning
one
we
believe
he
is
the
key
really
that's
fantabulous
and
impossible
he
can't
be
the
key
because
see
the
key
has
to
be
pure
this
is
a
vampire
lesson
number
one
vampires
equal
impure
yeah
damn
right
i'm
impure
i'm
as
impure
as
the
driven
yellow
snow
let
me
go
you
can't
even
brainsuck
a
vampire
he's
completely
useless
so
i'm
just
gonna
let
myself
out
but
your
holiness
we
observed
the
slayer
she
protected
this
one
above
all
others
she
treated
him
as
precious
really
preciousssss
let's
take
a
peek
at
you
precious
sod
off
oh
he
doesn't
look
very
fancy
to
me
hey
watch
the
lip
but
if
the
slayer
protects
him
maybe
appearances
are
deceiving
maybe
there's
something
on
the
inside
shhh
what
do
you
know
precious
what
can
i
dig
out
of
you
this
is
my
house
if
we're
gonna
stop
spike
from
blabbing
about
dawn
we're
gonna
need
these
ooh
the
big
guns
saddling
up
shouldn't
we
have
guns
those
are
my
weapons
give
me
something
big
and
sharp
um
buffy
where
do
we
go
where
should
we
look
for
glory
she's
a
god
she
wants
the
key
yeah
so
we
should
look
i
don't
know
why
are
you
all
looking
at
me
okay
buff
it's
okay
you're
right
you
shouldn't
have
to
know
everything
we
need
to
rescue
spike
um
buffy
i
i
think
you
have
more
weapons
upstairs
why
don't
you
go
get
those
and
maybe
change
your
clothes
you
know
something
more
fighty
i
can
do
that
i'll
be
right
back
okay
this
has
gone
way
too
far
she
thinks
we're
going
to
rescue
spike
what
are
we
gonna
do
find
him
keep
him
from
talking
whatever
it
takes
what
do
we
do
with
glory
whatever
we
do
we're
gonna
need
buffy's
help
then
we're
gonna
have
to
talk
to
her
intervention
time
again
yeah
'cause
what
we
need
right
now
is
a
sane
buffy
whoa
group
hang
time
thathat
was
quick
didn't
seem
like
it
to
me
death

my
gift

to
talk
what's
wrong
is
dawn
okay

we
care
about
you
and
we're
worried
about
you

doing
it's
wrong
wait
this
shouldn't
be
about
blame
blame
there's
blame
now
no
there's
only
love
and
some
fear
which
is
kind
of
thrown
by
the
you
having
sex
with
spike
the
who
whating
how
with
huh
okay
that's
denial
that
usually
comes
before
anger
i
am
not
having
sex
with
spike
anger
no
one
is
judging
you
it's
understandable
spike
is
strong
and
mysterious
and
sort
of
compact
but
wellmuscled
i
am
not
having
sex
with
spike
but
i'm
starting
to
think
that
you
might
be
buffy

saw
you
anya
too
we
saw
you
and
spike

with
the
straddling
spike's
mine

straddling
spike
oh
my
god

so
say
all
of
us
say
look
at
you
you
look
just
like
me
we're
very
pretty
two
of
them
hey
i
know
this
they're
both
buffy
no
she's
a
robot
she
acts
just
like
that
girlfriendbot
that
warren
guy
made
you
guys
couldn't
tell
me
apart
from
a
robot
oh
i
don't
think
i'm
a
robot
she's
very
well
done
spike
must
have
had
her
built
so
he
could
program
her
t
oh
god
yikes
imagine
the
things
no
no
no
imagining
any
of
you
already
got
the
visual
people
friends
of
mine
you're
forgetting
the
most
important
thing
glory
has
spike
and
she's
going
to
harm
him

has
spike
we
were
gonna
bring
that
up
we
were
getting
weapons

'em

going
now
i
have
to
kill

where
to
start
i
have
a
riddle
for

gonna
help
us
save
spike

we
are
not
going
to
save
him
we're
going
to
kill
him
he
knows
who
the
key
is
and
there's
no
way
he's
not
telling
glory
you're
right
he's
evil
but
you
should
see
him
naked

what
bad
home
perms
shut
up
i
command

okay
sorry
but
i
just
had
no
idea
that
gods
were
such
prancing
lightweights
mark
my
words
the
slayer
is
going
to
kick
your
skanky
lopsided
ass
back
to
whatever
place
would
take
a
cheap
whorish
fashion
victim
exgod
like
you
good
plan
spike
bring
him
back
here
oh
god
you
do
not
insult
glory
by
escaping
slayer
buffy
we're
here
spike
spike's
in
there
buffy
the
slayer
was
there
a
lethal
fighter
she
seemed
to
be
everywhere
at
once
she
had
friends
with
many
weapons
they
may
have
been
demons
and
where's
my
vampire
is
it
weird
oh
yeah
at
least
it's
not
a
very
good
copy
i
mean
look
at
it
uh
yeah
what'd
you
guys
do
with
spike
and
please
let
the
story
have
a
dusty
ending
we
dumped
him
back
in
his
crypt
tried
to
find
out
if
he'd
told
her
anything
but
he
was
too
badly
beaten
to
make
much
sense
well
even
if
he
told
her
he'd
just
lie
to
us
about
it
anyway
right
yeah
you
can
count
on
it
but
i
have
to
know
now
if
he
did
give
us
up
dawn
and
i
need
to
get
out
of
town
i
mean
she
could
be
on
her
way
right
now
but
uh
not
to
worry
you
know
i'm
sure
we'll
all
be
perfectly
safe
we're
safe
right
and
uh
spike
built
a
robot
buffy
to
play
checkers
with
iit
sounded
convincing
when
i
thought
it
hey
ii
think
i
found
somethin'
uch
looks
very
complicated
in
there
personally
i'd
rather
look
at
guts
i
found
where
she's
broken
some
of
these
wires
got
fried
extra
crispy
it's
an
easy
fix
i
mean
not
that
i
would
god
i
feel
kind
of
bad
for
the
guy
gets
all
whupped
and
his
best
toy
gets
taken
away
xander
please
don't
be
suggesting
what
i'd
have
to
kill
you
for
suggesting
no

travesty
completely
on
board

just
the
guy
was
so
thrashed
