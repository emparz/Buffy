going
to
kill
us
our
lives

have
to
protect
the
key
help
me
perform
the
ritual
concentrate
concentrate
i've
always
wanted
to
kill
the
slayer
and
i've
always
wanted
piano
lessons
so
really
who's
surprised
we
have
all
this
unexpressed
rage
but
honestly
i
think
i'm
expressing
mine

tell
you
what
you
find
yourself
a
good
anger
management
class
and
i'll
jam

for
closure

out
of
here
last
night
oh

yeah
darn
my
fellow
ravers
will
be
so
disappointed
it
was
my
turn
to
bring
the
bundt
cake
you
know
if
it
was
my
call
i'd
let
you
do
whatever
you
want
it's
not
like
anybody's
using
this
place
or
nothin'
but
they
just
don't
pay
me
enough
to
argue
with
the
boss
so
already
gone
oh
hey
hold
it
miss
take
your
whatever
this
is
with
you

you
glow
balls

i
swear
i
don't
get
your
generation
what

that
thing
i'll
let

as
soon
as
i
find
out
dawn

and
made
you
the
iron
chef
look

and
i
made
her
a
nice
noninstant
breakfast
for

pamper
mom
platter

what
did
the
doctor
say

a
day
and
come
back
for
tests
so
they
don't

kitteny
and
she'd
better
go
solo

you'd
get
hurt
so

a
security
guard
he's
not
crazy
if
you
say
so
they're
coming
at
you
don't
think
you're
above
it
missy
they
come
through
the
family
they
get
to
your
family

family

wrong
god

me
the
beast
there
you

i
have
been
looking
all
over
for
you
thank

for
choosing
to
shop
at
the
magic
box
and
please
do
come
again
did
you
see
that
customers
real
live
customers
they
came
in
and
i
gave
them
things
and
they
gave
me
money
and
then
they
left
it's
brilliant
congratulations
you're
an
official
capitalist
running
dog
but
i
gotta
tell
yaon
the
orbular
front
we're
batting
zeroes
well
we'll
just
have
to
keep
trying
if
there's
anything
you
need
help
with
let
me
know
your
conjuring
powder
is
grotesquely
overpriced
anya
i'm
sorry
i'm
nearly
out
of
money
i've
never
had
to
afford
things
before
and
it's
making
me
bitter
the
change
is
palpable
that
stuff
doesn't
come
cheap
well
you're
getting
ripped
off
i
could
hook
you
up
with
the
troll
that
sheds
it
giles
i
have
an
idea
what's
making
my
mom
sick
have
you
spoken
with
her
doctors
they
won't
find
anything
what's
hurting
her
it's
supernatural
the
night
watchman
who
found
this
thing
he
went
crazy
like
overnight
it
won't
hurt
us
i
had
it
on
me
all
night
but
this
guy
he
saw
things
he
said
things
such
as
they'll
come
at
me
through
my
family
who
will
i
don't
know
yet
but
whatever
touched
this
guy
it
made
him
see
through
what
the
rest
of
us
are
seeing
he
knew
someone's
hurting
my
mom
and
they're
trying
to
get
to
me
it's
possible
but
still
the
ramblings
of
a
madman
aren't
much
to
go
on
yeah
but
it's
a
start
we
need
to
find
out
who's
making
my
mom
sick
and
how
then
what
then
i
hunt
them
find
them
and
kill
them
you
know
when
you
think
about
it
i'm
the
victim
here
first
off
i
don't
even
want
to
be
here
and
i'm
not
talking
about
this
room
or
this
city
or
this
state
or
this
planet
i'm
talking
about
the
whole
mortal
coil
now
you
know
it's
disgusting
the
food
the
clothes
the
people
i
could
crap
a
better
existence
than
this
but
okay
and
feel
free
to
tell
me
if
this
next
part
gets
a
little
too
personal
because
i'm
told
i
have
boundary
issues
but
i'm
hurt
yes
by
your
incredibly
selfish
behavior
newsflash
hairdo
it's
not
always
about
you
all
i
want
is
the
key
why
why
can't
you
tell
me
where
the
key
is
oh

me
monkey
sometimes
i
just
i
get
so
anxious
like
there's
something
deep
inside
of
me
and
it's
swelling
up
and
it's
making
me
crazy
that
i
forget
there's
all
that
duct
tape
on
your
face

thousandyard
stare
damn
you

to

it
on

but
i
have
their
money
who
cares
what
kind
of
day
they
have
no
one
it's
just
a
long
cultural
tradition
of
raging
insincerity
embrace
it
hey
you
have
a
nice
day
there's
my
girl
did
you
ever
think
in
a
million
years
you'd
miss
the
high
school
library
someone
put
a
spell
on
my
mom
something
to
make
it
seem
like
she's
sick
that's
a
new
kind
of
nasty
any
suspects
well
i've
got
the
list
narrowed
down
to
just
under
infinity
does
this
look
right
to
you
sure
if
you
wrapped
it
with
your
feet
you
know
buffy
there
used
to
be
this
french
sorcerer
back
in
the
16th
idon'tknowwhat
named
cloutier
so
cute
in
his
little
knickers
but
he
had
this
one
spell
demons
just
hated
called
tirer
la
couture
rotate
many
foodstuffs
pull
the
curtain
back
a
spell
to
see
spells
well
a
trance
to
see
spells
actually
but
you
get
the
idea
try
that
what
do
you
mean
see
spells
well
all
spells
leave
a
trace
signature
it's
just
not
perceptible
to
the
human
eye
in
this
case
it
could
be
the
image
of
a
hand
choking
your
mother
or
a
cloud
of
mist
around
her
or
maybe
the
shape
of
the
demon
that's
performing
the
spell
possible
yes
okay
so
i'll
do
what
monsieur
silk
knickers
did
i'll
go
home
i'll
get
trancey
and
i'll
see
what's
affecting
my
mom
i
don't
know
buffy
trances
yes
buffy
the
sorcerer
cloutier
was
legendary
his
skills
at
achieving
higher
states
of
consciousness
were
better
than
mine
i
knew
he
was
gonna
say
that
but
i've
been
practicing
concentration
skills
i
know
i'm
close
are
you
ready
it's
my
mom
i'll
get
ready
what
do
i
need
thanks
for
coming
over
i
really
appreciate
the
help
sure
thing
so
what
do
i
do
lots
tons
lots
and
lots
of
tons
this
is
all
kinda
new
terrain
all
prayin'
no
slayin'
okay
so
the
incense
needs
to
be
ignited
and
there's
a
job
and
this
stuff
needs
to
get
poured
around
me
in
a
circle
counterclockwise
so
you
need
me
to
light
incense
and
pour
sand
magick
incense
and
spooky
sand
and
the
ritual
itself
is
something
you
do
alone
you
sure
this
isn't
just
your
way
of
trying
to
make
me
feel
less
what
are
the
words
cute
and
weak
and
kittenish
kitteny
right
much
manlier
look
i
really
am
okay
i
know

quite
super

was
borrowed
power
anyway

to
give
it
back
some
time
i
know
you
can
handle
yourself
i
just
didn't
want
to
see
you
get
hurt
maybe
instead
of
you
trying
to
take
care
of
me
we
agree
to
take
care
of
each
other
deal
done
for
luck

so
grown
up
buffy

said
you
could
come
in
my
room

sister

like
i
even
want
to
be
related
to
your
nasty
self
ow
what
are

doing
what
are
you
get
off
me
you
want
to
hurt
me
let
go
of
me
you
freak
then
you
deal
with
me
i'm
telling
mom
you
stay
away
from
my
mother
what
buffy
oh
i'm
glad
i've
caught
you
i
think
we
may
have
underestimated
what
we're
dealing
with
go
on
we've
uncovered
more
than
expected
about
this
orb
it's
called
the
dagon
sphere
and
it
has
a
history
going
back
many
centuries
what's
it
do
it's
a
protective
device
used
to
ward
off
ancient
primordial
evil
any
word
on
what
this
evil
looks
like
unfortunately
no
this
is
where
excuse
me
this
is
where
accounts
get
vague
all
we've
managed
to
uncover
so
far
is
the
dagon
sphere
was
created
to
repel
that
which
cannot
be
named
i'm
going
to
go
back
to
the
factory
where
i
found
it
whoever
planted
this
doohickey's
got
answers
buffy
you've
heard
me
say
this
before
but
do
be
careful
anything
that
goes
unnamed
is
usually
an
object
of
deep
worship
or
great
fear
maybe
both
have
you
completed
the
trance
seen
what's
harming
your
mother
that's
the
thing
i
just
saw
yes
nothing
it
didn't
work
what
are
you
talking
about
slayer
stuff
i'm
going
out
do
you
really
think
i
care
you're
the
slayer
what's
that
supposed
to
mean
i'll
be
home
in
an
hour
mom's
coming
back
i'll
be
back
first
spike
hi
buffy
don't
take
this
the
wrong
way
but
ow
what
are
you
doing
here
five
words
or
less
out
for
a
walk
bitch
out
for
a
walk
at
night
by
my
house
no
one
has
time
for
this
on
your
merry
way
then
you
know
contrary
to
one's
selfinvolved
worldview
your
house
happens
to
be
directly
between
parts
and
other
parts
of
this
town
and
i
would
pass
by
in
the
day
but
i
feel
i'm
outgrowing
my
whole
burst
into
flame
phase
fine
keep
going
i
cut
you
a
break
oh
yeah
okay
let
me
guess
you
won't
kill
me
wooo
the
whole
crowdpleasing
threatsandswagger
routine
how
stunningly
original
you
know
i'm
just
passing
through
satisfied
you
know
i
really
hope
so
because
god
knows
you
need
some
satisfaction
in
life
besides
shagging
captain
cardboard
and
i
never
really
liked
you
anyway
and
and
you
have
stupid
hair
buffy
girls
where
is
everybody
hi
mom
oh
dawn
where's
buffy
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
her
you're
probably
right
i
mean
it's
not
like
she's
never
patrolled
before
anyway
i
was
feeling
kind
of
what's
the
medical
term
crappy
so
i
called
off
the
big
night
out
want
tea
mom
i
made
it
for
you
whoa
it
was
you
who
planted
the
dagon
sphere
right
i
got
it
don't
worry
i'm
stronger
than
i
look
i
have
had
experience
with
stuff
like
this
before
best
of
all
i'm
not
stupid

about
that
last
part

someone

rip
that
bloody
bell

hinges

that
involve
moving
my
feet
are
numb
i'll
see
your
numbness
and
i'll
raise
you
a
lower
back
pain
i
think
i
liked
it
better
when
demons
would
just
crash
in
here
and
tear
the
place
apart
just
seemed
so
much
simpler
you're
out
of
crystal
balls

babies

really
popular
with
the
amateurs

restock
and
raise
the
price

anya
your
cash
register
looks
like
squirrels
nest
in
it

and
the
hand

some
serious
raw
power
