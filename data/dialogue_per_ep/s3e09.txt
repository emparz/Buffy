nnnrrf
nnnrrf
oh
god
demon
demon
what
kills
a
demon
nnnrrf
nnnrrf
oh
nerf
not
nerf
knife
okay
that
was
too
close
for
comfort
not
that
slaying
is
ever
comfy
but
you
know
what
i
mean
if
you
guys
hadn't
been
here
to
help
but
we
were
and
we
did
and
and
we're
all
fine
isn't
he
gonna
go
poof
mm
i
guess
these
guys
don't
we'll
have
to
bury
him
or
something
uhhf
makes
you
appreciate
vamps
though
no
fuss
no
muss
so
how
come
faith
was
a
noshow
i
thought
mucusy
demons
were
her
favorites
couldn't
reach
her
again
she
hasn't
been
hanging
out
much
i
detect
worry
a
little
bit
slaying's
a
rough
gig
too
much
alone
time
isn't
healthy
stuff
gets
pentup
we
should
try
to
do
more
socializing
with
her
well
burial
detail
aside
does
this
cap
us
off
for
the
day
you
got
plans
i
cannot
stress
enough
how
much
i
don't
have
plans
no
luck
reaching
cordelia
i've
left
a
few
messages
sixty
seventy
but
you
know
what
really
bugs
me
okay
we
kissed
it
was
a
mistake
but
i
know
that
was
positively
the
last
time
we
were
ever
gonna
kiss
darn
tootin'
and
they
burst
in
rescuing
us
without
even
knocking
i
mean
this
is
really
all
their
fault
your
logic
does
not
resemble
our
earth
logic
mine
is
much
more
advanced
at
least
tomorrow's
monday
another
school
day
well
that's
good
you
know
focus
on
school
that's
the
strong
willow
way
to
heal
actually
i
was
more
thinking
oz
will
be
there
and
i
can
beg
for
forgiveness
that
works
too
ii
wanna
be
strong
willow
but
then
i
think
i
may
never
get
to
be
close
to
oz
again
and
it's
like
all
the
air
just
goes
out
of
the
room
i
know
the
feeling
right
i
mean

went
through
it
with
angel

you're
still
standing

prada
from
payless
god
cordy
when
i

i
couldn't
believe
it
but
it
was
smart
you

everybody
forget
about
the
temporary
insanity
that
was
xander

what
you
have
to
do
start
dating
get

just
the
stallion

you
at
least
not
for
a
while
plus
he's
got
a
kill
moped
oz
wow
look
at
us
running
into
each
other
as
two
people
who
go
to
the
same
school

me
i
wanna
try
just
you

about
it
we
could
look
i'm
sorry
this
is
hard
for
you
but
i
told
you
what
i
need
so
i
can't
help
feeling
like
the
reason
you
want
to
talk

so
you
can
feel
better
about
yourself
that's
not
my
problem
hey
john
lee

back
to
second
string
if
anyone
saw
me

with
xander
harris'
castoff

the
justified
camp

with
me
he's
actually
making
sense
we're
young
and
free
in
america
how
dare
we
be
spun
by
love
or
the
lack
of
same
absolutely
iit's
selfindulgent
ii'm
in
i'm
on
the
joy
train
that
didn't
work
who
wants
chocolate
i'm
up
look
at
her
tears
of
a
clown
baby
or
is
it
grins
of
a
sad
person
or
maybe
it's
xander
your
hand
oops
sorry
but
why
'oops'
i
mean
we
always
touch
digits
it's
a
friend
thing
comfort
like
chocolate
maybe
it
used
to
be
but
since
we
it's
different
ii'm
sorry
but
if
i
wanna
make
things
right
with
oz
my
hands
my
all
my
stuff
has
to
be
for
him
only
hey
cordelia
wait
a
second
did
xander
send
you
to
beg
for
him
no
i'm
a
free
agent
i
promise
i
just
wanted
to
see
how
you
are
never
been
better
cordelia
i
know
what
it's
like
to
be
hurt
by
someone
hurt
so
much
that
you
don't
think
you're
gonna
make
it
but
i
told
my
friends
how
i
felt
and
you
know
what
it
got
a
little
better
cordelia
look
out
you
know
what
i've
been
asking
myself
a
lot
this
last
week
why
me
why
do
i
get
impaled
why
do
i
get
bitten
by
snakes
why
do
i
fall
for
incredible
losers
and
you
know
i
think
i've
finally
figured
it
out
what
my
problem
is
it's
buffy
summers
that's
when
all
my
troubles
started
when
she
moved
here
are
you
okay
oh
i
just
pulled
some
stitches
last
night
know
why
surprise
it
was
buffy's
fault
oh
hey
it's
garbage
girl
loved
the
look
last
night
cor
here
i
think
you
need
this
more
than
i
do
right
now
yeah
i
can
use
some
luck
and
a
stick
with
pointy
sharp
bits
if
that
buffy
wasn't
i
swear
she's
a
pain
but
xander
he's
an
utter
loser
don't
you
wish
i
never
would've
looked
twice
at
xander
if
buffy
hadn't
made
him
marginally
cooler
by
hanging
with
him
really
yeah
i
swear
i
wish
buffy
summers
had
never
come
to
sunnydale
done
anya
'i
wish
buffy
summers
had
never
come
to
sunnydale'
where

probably
asked

buffy
the
dogfaced
girl
duh

doing
wearing
that
everyone
knows
that
vampires
are
attracted
to
bright
colors

look
good
than
to
feel
alive
uh

uh
watch
the
perimeters
in
case
they
follow
slap
my
hand
dead
soul

isn't
that
what
they
called
the
slayer
hmm
buffy
ooo
scary
someone
has
to
talk
to
her
people
that
name
is
striking
fear
in
nobody's
hearts
she
talked
of
summoning
the
slayer
here
now
at
this
time
and
you
didn't
kill
her
well
they
had
crosses
the
plant
begins
operation
in
less
than
twentyfour
hours
you

her
watcher
i'd
expect
her
to
at
least
check
in
to
yes
i'm
aware
that
there's
a
great
deal
of
demonic
activity
in
cleveland

a
big
party
you
remember
i
told
you
about
the
plant
all
those
people
you
tried
to
save
it's
gonna
be
quick
for
them
not
for
you
though
it's
gonna
be
slow
for
you
that's
right
puppy
willow's
gonna
make
you
bark
oh
maybe
i
went
too
hard
on
you
last
time
too
hard
no

it
with
those
things
you
almost
got
my
hair
sorry

carried
away
don't
you
want
to
no
thanks
baby
i
just
wanna
watch
you
go
here
it
is
i've
found
it
look
it's
what
um
cordelia
was
wearing
it's
the
the
uh
symbol
of
of
anyanka
i
don't
think
i
know
her
well
no
um
anyanka
is
a
sort
of
a
patron
saint
of
scorned
women
what
does
she
do
uh
shshe
grants
wishes
so
cordelia
wished
for
something
well
if
it
was
a
long
healthy
life
she
should
get
her
money
back
she
said
something
about
everything
being
different
that
the
okay
the
entire
world
sucks
because
some
dead
ditz
made
a
wish
i
just
i
just
want
it
clear
she
said
the
uh
the
slayer
was
supposed
to
be
here
was
um
meant
to
have
been
here
already
certainly
would've
helped
yes
i
tried
calling
her
but
um
look
i'm
i'm
i'm
gonna
have
to
research
this
anyanka
thing
further
um
i
have
some
more
volumes
at
at
home
you
two
two
get
some
sleep
watch
your
back
run
buffy
summers
that's
right
wanna
tell
me
what
i'm
doing
here
ah
ah
ah
yes
here
'in
order
to
defeat
anyanka
one
must
destroy
her
powercenter
this
should
reverse
all
the
wishes
she's
granted
rendering
her
mortal
and
powerless
again'
you
see
without
her
powercenter
she'd
jjust
be
aaan
ordinary
woman
again
and
all
this
would
be
um
well
different
well
i'd
say
that
my
my
watcher
muscles
haven't
completely
atrophied
after
all
great
what's
her
powercenter

just
a
big
fan
the
master
sent
his
most
vicious
disciples

he
lives
on
the

behold
the
technical
wonder
which

alter
the
very
fabric
of
our
society

have
argued
that
such
an
advancement
goes
against
our
nature
they
claim
that
death
is
our
art
i
say
to
them
well
i
don't
say
anything
to
them
because
i
kill
them
undeniably
we
are
the
world's
superior
race
yet
we
have
always
been
too
parochial
too
bound
by
the
mindless
routine
of
the
predator
hunt
and
kill
hunt
and
kill
titillating
yes
yeah
yeah
we
really
are
living
in
a
golden
age

the
name
of
all
women
scorned

of
the
earth
that
would
be
so
