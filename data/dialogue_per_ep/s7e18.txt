so
much
filth
that

room
for
words
of
truth

there's
no
blame
here
you
were
born
dirty
born
without
a
soul
born
with
that
gaping
maw
wants
to
open
up
suck
out
a
man's
marrow
makes
me
puke
to
think
too
hard
on
it
yeah
that
there
door's
problematical
i
don't
know
as
i
could
recommend
steppin'
out
at
this
speed
anyway
you're
like
as
not
to
tumble
some
but
of
course
there's
my
boys
back
there—ooh
they
hate
to
miss
a
mark
your
boys
well
they
ain't
exactly
my
blue
eyed
boys
but
they're
hard
workers
and
they
don't
truck
with
satan—that
was
just
me
having
fun
satan
is
a
little
man
i
don't
like
backseat
drivers
pleasedon't
hurt
me
well
now
is
this
the
part
where
you
offer
to
do
anything
because
i
tried
to
make
it
clear—you
got
nothin'
i
want
to
explore
oh
yeah
that's
it
that's
a
cleansing
fire
hallelujah
now
if
i'm
not
mistaken
there's
a
car
a
little
ways
behind
us
and
i
do
believe
there's
some
folk
in
it
goin'
the
same
place
you
are
now
i
want
you
to
deliver
a
message
for
me
but
it's
not
for
them
it's
for
the
other
one—the
one
and
only
the
original
acceptnosubstitutes
slayer
would
you
tell
her
something
for
me
yes
thank
you
shannon

that
door

that's
just
it
though
how
will
i

to
trust
us
i'm
so
scared
xander
i'm
so
young
well
believe
it
or
not
i
was
younger
than
you
when
i
started
all
this
there's
just
so
much
i
haven't
done
so
much
i
need
to
do
it's
like
i
never
had
a
real
boyfriend
you
know
yeah
i've
never
been
with
a
man
i
could
die
tomorrow
and
i've
never
been
with
a
man
well
uh—
i've
never
been
with
a
man
before
either
colleen
i've
never
been
with
her
in
front
of
a
man
before
i've
never
been
with
her
in
front
of
a
man
either
um
xander
we
can't
we're
so
scared
the
others
might
hear
us
no
they
won't
they're
ok
xander
xander
wha—
god
damn
it
what's
going
on
i
was
sleeping
dominique
has
the
stomach
flu
and
the
toilet
bowl
is
backed
up
i'll
be
right
out
got
uh
a
leg
cramp
you
sure
she's
one
of
us
she
don't
look
like
much
now
not
a
potential
slayer
i
mean
don't
know
seems
to
fit
though
we'll
know
more
when
she
regains
consciousness
if
she
regains
consciousness
girl's
been
gutted
like
a
catfish
yeah
something's
killing
girls
all
over
the
world
trying
to
end
the
slayer
line
thing
like
that
figure
i
might
get
a
heads
up
faith
guess
it
doesn't
really
matter
as
long
as
you
got
the
true
slayer
intact
you
were
in
prison
figured
you
were
safe
there
yeah
that's
prison
safe
as
a
kitten
sorry
i
don't
know
much
about
the
big
house
was
it—
i
mean
did
something
happen
in
there
someone
came
at
me
with
a
nasty
looking
knife
didn't
really
know
why
'til
now
oh
faith
we
didn't—
forget
it
it's
cool
i
get
by
what're
we
gonna
do
about
her
uh
i
guess
we
should
find
buffy
tell
her
what's
going
on
ii
tried
calling
home
dawn
says
she's
out
patrolling
let's
go
look

fun
anyway
wait
somebody
should
wait
here
in
case
she
wakes
up
fine
sit
tight
i'll
be
back
wwwait
uh
maybe
you
meeting
buffy
alone
isn't
the
best
idea
you
told
her
the
sitch
right
she
knows
i'm
coming
probably
been
up
all
night
hanging
streamers
yeah
but
it's
not
like

study
buddies
exactly
maybe
it'd
be
better
if
ieased

into
the
whole
thing
i
can't
stay
here
willow
spent
way
too
much
time

same
old

actually
new
house
buffy
we
have
a
new
house
guest
hey
got
a
spare
bed
for
a
wanted
fugitive
hello
faith
well
i
guess
wanted
wasn't
really
accurate
does
she
have
to
stay
here
because
there's
some
nice
hotels
that
welcome
triedtokillyoursister
types
check
it
out
brat's
all
womansized
look
i
need
to
get
to
the
hospital
some
girl
was
attacked
on
her
way

we
think
she
might
be

we
know
willow's
been
calling
she's
still
there
she's
gonna
call
if
the
girl
wakes
up
fine
well
faith
we
better
um
see
if
we
can
find
some
place
to
squeeze
you
in
for
the
night
not
all
that
tension
was
about
you
giles
was
a
part
of
a
plan
to
kill
mefor
buffy's
own
good
well
that
makes
me
feel
better
about
me
worse
about
gileskinda
shaky
about
you
drink
of
this
for
it
is
my
blood
you
know
i
always
loved
the
story
of
the
last
supper
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
becoming
rich
red
wine
i
recall
as
a
boy
though
i
couldn't
help
but
think
what
would
happen
if
you
were
at
the
last
supper
and
you
ordered
the
white
a
nice
oaky
chardonnay
or
white
zin
i
mean
would
he
make
that
out
of
his
lymph
or
someall
never
did
bring
it
up
suppose
there
was
a
reason
why
i
never
spent
too
long
in
one
parish
just
looking
for
answers
just
looking
for
the
lord
in
the
wrong
damn
places
then
you
showed
me
the
light
do
you
think
i'm
god
i
certainly
do
not
i
am
beyond
concepts
like
that
but
you
still
wear
the
outfit
man
can't
turn
his
back
on
what
he
come
from
besides
black
is
slimming
everyone
knows
that
how
do
you
like
what
i'm
wearing
just
another
dirty
girl
and
since
you
only
dress
up
in
dead
folk
i'm
guessing
one
who's
already
been
paid
her
wage
look
hard
what
do
you
see
strength
and
the
loneliness
that
comes
with
real
strength
nothing
about
my
pert
and
bouncy
hairdo
you're
her
the
slayer
at
long
last
all
this
time
all
the
work
i've
done
for
you
blowing
up
the
council
organizing
the
ray
charles
brigade
and
stickin'
all
them
splits—you
never
showed
me
well
you've
earned
it
and
you'll
be
meeting
her
soon
am
i
right
oh
yeah
yeah
she'll
get
the
message
and
what
makes
you
so
sure
she'll
come
curiosity
woman's
first
sin
i
offer
her
an
apple
what
can
she
do
but
take
it
i'll
see
you
soon
while
andrew
talks
show
various
glamour
shots
of
faith
from
shows
past
what
the
hell
are
you
talking
about
i
thought
faith
killed
a
volcanologist
silly
sillyamanda
why
would
faith
kill
a
person
who
studies
vulcans
he
studied
volcanoes
he
was
a
professor
ah
yes
well
regardless
i
thought
you
weren't
supposed
to
be
doing
this
anymore—making
up
stories
i'm
not
this
is
true
except
for
thatpossibleword
misunderstanding
they're
the
things
you
need
to
know
about
faithhas
a
history
not
to
be
taken
lightly
she's
a
killer
never
forget
that
you
must
stay
on
guard
around
faith
at
all
times
your
very
lives
may
depend
on
it
you
look
better
no
i
don't
no
you
don't
but
i'll
be
ok
unless
of
course
you
start
beating
up
on
me
now
i
won't
well
i
thought
about
it
i
made
some
doodles
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
we're
on
even
ground
i
meant
what
i
said
i
don't
have
time
for
your
vendetta
but
i
need
you
in
this
fight
i
want
you
on
my
side
thanks
that
means
a
lot
so
we're
good
absolutely
you're
fired
what
effective
immediately
you're
firing
me
i
just
refrained
from
kicking
your
ass
buffy
there's
nothing
here
for
you
i
mean
people
are
leaving
town
half
the
kids
don't
even
bother
showing
up
anymore
you've
got
things
to
deal
with
that
are
much
worse
than
anything
here
look
at
the
big
picture
right
the
big
picture
the
one
with
the
big
war
and
the
dead
little
girls
not
dead
not
dead
not
if
you
get
them
ready
i
don't
want
to
lead
them
into
war
it
can't
be
the
right
thing
most
wars
aren't
you
know
some
of
these
girl
haven't
even
been
tested
in
battle
then
i
guess
maybe
you
should
test
them
couldn't
i
just
come
to
work
parttime
i
could
make
flyers
for
encounter
groups
and
post
them
up
all
over
school
and
you're
fired
again
remember
buffy
the
mission's
what
matters
you
craving
a
moment
alone
in
the
dank
or
can
i
bum
one
well
i
guess
you
can
smoke
all
you
want—the
big
c
not
really
an
issue
teeth
get
yellow
after
an
eternity
gotta
watch
that
huh
right
not
what
it
looks
like
hey
to
each
his
own
man
this
one
guy
i
ran
with
he
liked
me
to
dress
up
like
a
school
girl
and
take
this
friggin'
bullwhip
and
i'd
be
like—
i
got
dangerousfor
a
while
this
before
the
soul
or
after
after
but
i
got
over
it—in
case
you're
feeling
all
dusthappy
again
after
your
long
incarceration
not
if
you're
all
repenty
takes
the
fun
out
of
it
no
more
starbucks
for
the
wannabe's
man
they've
been
spazzing
for
like
hours
yeah
does
get
a
bit
much
up
there
they're
good
girls
just
green
is
all
so
why
aren't
you
up
thereimparting
that's
buffy's
thing
anyway
i
just
spent
a
good
stretch
of
time
locked
away
with
a
mess
of
femaletypes
kinda
had
my
fill
hm
but
you
waited
until
angel
needed
your
help
to
bust
out
of
jail
three
squares
nice
weight
room
movie
every
third
sunday
could've
been
worse
what
movie
last
one
was
glitter
i
guess
it
couldn't
have
been
worse
you
had
the
power
to
walk
away
anytime
nothing
to
stop
you
i
stopped
me
i
got
dangerous
for
a
while
you
over
it
more
or
less
i
pull
for
the
good
guys
now
what's
the
less
the
usual
stuff
such
as
i
was
thinking
about
looking
up
the
guy
with
the
bullwhip
long
incarceration
you
could
do
better
school
girl
thing's
old
hat
it's
all
oldhat
man
every
guy's
got
some
whack
fantasy
scratch
the
surface
of
any
granolatype
dude—naughty
nurses
and
horny
cheerleaders
i
figure
if
you
can't
beat
'em—
join
'em
just
don't
forget
who's
on
top
that
i
suspect
would
be
you
you
got
that
right
i've
met
you
before
you
know
yeah
you
made
a
great
impression
on
my
chin
not
in
the
graveyard
before
that
i
was
kinda
wearing
a
different
body
pity
you
seemed
ok
with
it
the
body
swap
with
buffy
she
fill
you
in
on
that
whole
deal
she
told
me
it
went
down
failed
to
mention
who
was
driving
her
skin
around
i
may
have
said
a
few
things
like
you
could
ride
me
at
a
gallop
'til
my
knees
buckle
squeeze
me
'til
i
pop
like
warm
champagne
that's
not
the
kind
of
thing
a
man
forgets
should've
known
it
wasn't
blondie
behind
the
wheel
she'd
never
throw
down
like
that
oh
you
have
been
away
don't
even
tell
me
little
miss
tightlywound's
been
getting
her
naughty
on
not
of
late
wow
everybody's
just
full
of
surprises
hey
b
well
it's
nice
to
see
you
two
getting
along
so
well
yeah
uh
you
just
know
all
the
cool
vampires
yeah
hey
aren't
you
usually
at
work
'bout
now
i
kind
of
decided
to
cut
back
on
my
hours
buffy
is
that
you
down
here
figured
i'd
be
better
off
focusing
on
what's
going
on
around
here
buffy
willow
just
called
from
the
hospital
the
girl's
awake
he
was
a
minister
or
something
at
least
he
dressed
like
one
i
thought
he
was
trying
to
save
meat
first
he—he
picked
you
up
on
the
side
of
the
road
bringers
were
chasing
me
he
said
they
were
his
boysright
before
he
burned
me
he
wanted
to
tell
you
something
before
hecut
mehe
told
me
to
give
the
slayer
a
message
what
is
it
he
said
i
have
something
of
yours
we've
got
a
new
player
in
town
dresses
like
a
preacher
calls
himself
caleb
looks
like
he's
working
for
the
first
he's
taunting
us
calling
us
out
says
he's
got
something
of
mine
could
be
another
girl
could
be
something
else
don't
know
don't
care
i'm
tired
of
talking
i'm
tired
of
training
he's
got
something
of
mine
fine
i'm
getting
it
back
and
you
guys
are
coming
with
me
you're
searching
for
something
girl
what
would
that
be
now
oh
you
i
was
looking
for
you
is
that
right
i
heard
you
speakin'
tonight
preachin'
i
felt
your
words
go
straight
to
me
well
the
truth
is
like
a
sword
isn't
it
girl
cuts
deep
yeah
the
words
i
use
got
a
power
to
them
a
power
now
they're
not
just
words—they're
truth
they
brought
me
here
they
called
you
you
know
why
because
you're
human
you
got
your
urges
a
woman's
got
hers
a
man's
got
his
our
whole
race
can
be
do
damnably
weak
that's
why
we
seek
the
strength
the
power
it's
not
wrong
to
be
drawn
to
the
power
is
it
preacher
oh
no
child
it's
not
wrong
just
human
most
people
don't
like
visits
from
their
dead
you
know
heathens
no
appreciations
for
life's
pleasures
do
it
again
i
take
requests
one
of
those
potentials
you
killed
perhaps
no
save
them
for
later
i'm
in
more
of
an
old
memory
lane
kind
of
mood
back
before
i
met
you
there
was
this
choir
girl
in
knoxville
i
used
to
give
singing
lessons
towhy
she
even
screamed
on
key
show
me
her
all
these
girlsthey
followed
you
willingly
you
tricked
them
i
only
told
them
the
truth
as
for
following
well
that
seems
to
be
what
they
do
best
we
need
to
start
arming
the
girls
i
wanna
be
ready
to
move
when
we
find
him
we
don't
even
know
where
we're
going
's
why
i
figured
we'd
do
a
little
recon
first
you
up
for
it
point
me
where
you
want
me
and
you're
certain
this
is
the
best
course
of
action
you
don't
even
know
what
this
man
has
of
yours—if
he
in
fact
has
anything
it
could
be
a
girl
a
potential
trying
to
get
to
us
could
be
a
stapler
going
in
anyway
with
the
girls
most
of
whom
have
yet
to
be
in
the
field
let
alone
in
a
life
or
death
situation
then
it's
time
we
test
them
look
i'll
just
take
the
ones
that
have
been
here
the
longest
the
rest
can
stay
behind
could
be
that's
just
what
he
wants
you
to
do—the
old
baitandswitch
yeah
he
lures
us
away
and
then
kills
the
girls
we
leave
behind
i
know
that's
why
i
need
you
to
stay
here
with
them
you're
my
most
powerful
weapon
will
i
know
you
can
keep
them
safe
if
anything
happens
an
unknown
man
breezes
into
town
says
he
has
something
of
yours
buffy
this
thing's
got
trap
written
all
over
it
he
won't
be
expecting
a
full
attack—not
this
soon
that's
why
we
have
to
move
we
know
nothing
about
this
man
we
cannot
go
into
battle
unprepared
we
have
to
have
more
time
giles
we
don't
have
time
and
you're
not
going
into
battle
i
need
you
to
stay
behind
with
the
others
help
the
girls
who
still
need
a
teacher
no
eyes
but
look
at
him
go
he
got
sonar
or
something
or
something
i
guess
pretty
good
when
they
attack
do
they
just
roam
free
around
town
well
normally
they
show
up
out
of
nowhere
and
then
either
stab
or
get
stabbed
and
then
they
run
off
looks
like
this
guy
wants
to
be
found
lends
weight
to
the
whole
it's
a
trap
theory
i'm
through
waiting
around
for
people
to
attack
us
hey
i'm
with
you
drop
me
in
the
hornet's
nest
what
the
hell
you
got
a
rough
sitch
here
trying
to
turn
a
bunch
of
little
girls
into
an
army
they're
potential
slayers
just
like
we
were
right
maybe
they'll
do
as
good
as
us
they're
getting
better
i'll
work
with
'em
some
of
'em
seem
real
eager
fashion
disasters
yeah
but
they're
ready
to
fight
why
did
you
come
back
willow
said
you
needed
me
didn't
give
it
a
lot
of
thought
do
you—am
i
getting
you
want
me
to
be
not
here
no
that's
not
what
i
meant
i'mglad
that
you're
here
it's
good
thank
you
no
problem
you
know
me
all
about
the
good
deeds
willow
said
you
helped
out
angel
yeah
he
says
hi
really
sure
how
is
he
better
had
to
do
this
whole
magical
mindwalk
with
him
you
were
in
angel's
mind
buffy
what
is
this
place
look
there's
more
of
them
i
think
we
just
found
our
hornet's
nest
let's
get
the
cavalry
now
remember
we're
looking
for
killing
blows
only
people
so
chest
and
throat
if
it's
a
vampire
stomach
chest
and
face
if
it's
a
bringer
what
if
it's
something
else
could
happen
something
otherworldly
and
here's
a
handy
rule
don't
go
for
the
flashy
tentacles
just
because
they're
waving
'em
about
trying
to
get
attention
go
for
the
center—
brains
heart
eyes
everything's
got
eyes
except
the
bringers
except
the
bringers
i
don't
want
there
to
be
tentacles
i'm
not
good
with
squishy
i
don't
care
if
it's
godzilla
i
want
to
get
in
this
thing
godzilla's
mostly
tokyobased
so
he's
probably
a
noshow
besides
if
matthew
broderick
can
kill
godzilla
how
tough
is
he
xander
matthew
broderick
did
not
kill
godzilla
he
killed
a
big
dumb
lizard
that
was
not
the
real
godzilla
you
people
are
even
crazier
than
her
than
who
buffy
man
i
mean
taking
us
right
into
the
bad
guy's
lair
well
that's
where
generally
speaking
you'd
go
to
find
the
bad
guy
and
i
don't
think
you
came
here
to
fight
plaque
no
i
came
here
for
protection
well
you
signed
on
to
fight
with—
look
i
know
but
this
plan
is
trouble
ok
buffy
doesn't
care
how
many
of
us
she
puts
in
danger—
let
me
tell
you
something
about
buffy
in
fact
you
should
all
listen
to
this
uh
we
kinda
were
i've
been
through
more
battles
with
buffy
than
you
all
can
ever
imagine
she's
stopped
everything
that's
ever
come
up
against
her
she's
laid
down
her
life—literally—to
protect
the
people
around
her
this
girl
has
died
two
times
and
she's
still
standing
you're
scared
that's
smart
you
got
questions
you
should
but
you
doubt
her
motives
you
think
buffy's
all
about
the
kill
then
you
take
the
little
bus
to
battle
i've
seen
her
heart
and
this
time—not
literally
and
i'm
telling
you
right
now
she
cares
more
about
your
lives
than
you
will
ever
know
you
gotta
trust
her
she's
earned
it
damn
i
never
knew
you
were
that
cool
well
you
always
were
a
little
slow
i
get
that
now
all
right
let's
saddle
up
ok
set
up
a
perimeter
guard
the
door
i
don't
want
anything
getting
in
behind
us
my
team
goes
in
first
we
check
the
place
out
you
guys
are
our
safetynet
if
this
place
is
a
trap
we
give
the
signal
you
guys
come
in
guns
ablazing
so
what's
the
signal
i'm
thinking
lots
and
lots
of
yelling
got
it
shall
we
what
is
this
place
looks
like
an
old
vineyard
an
evil
vineyard
huh
like
falcon
crest
stay
alert
you
guys
bringers
are
here
somewhere
just
need
to
find
out
where
shouldn't
be
too
hard
well
now
you
girls
are
just
burning
with
righteousness
aren't
you
problem
is
you
think
you're
blazing
like
suns
when
really
you're
burning
like
matchsticks
in
the
face
of
the
darkness
you
having
fun
now
i
hope
my
boys
haven't
worn
you
out
too
much—i
need
you
fit
for
when
i
purify
you
save
the
sermon
padre
i
heard
you
have
something
of
mine
well
i
do
now
you
liked
my
little
message
did
you
you
know
i
ruined
a
perfectly
good
knife
on
that
girl
got
her
soiled
blood
all
over
the
place
i
may
have
to
get
a
new
truck
so
you're
the
slayer
the
slayer
the
strongest
the
fastest
the
most
aflame
with
that
most
precious
invention
of
all
mankind—the
notion
of
goodness
the
slayer
must
indeed
be
powerful
so
what
else
you
got
let's
go
kennedy
miss
i
do
believe
you
have
your
own
problems
you
should
be
worrying
about
oh
good
there's
more
of
you
buffy
well
you're
the
other
one
aren't
you
your
cain
to
her
abel
no
offense
meant
to
cain
of
course
never
was
much
for
the
good
book
oh
it
has
its
moments
paul
had
some
good
stuff
for
instance
but
overall
i
find
it
a
tad
complicated
i
like
to
keep
things
simple
good
folk
bad
folk
clean
folk
dirty
folk
no
yes
xander
get
them
out
of
here
we
have
to
retreat
do
it
what
can
i
say
i
work
in
mysterious
ways
also
some
fairly
straightforward
ones
we're
all
leaving
are
you
ok
let's
go
come
on
let's
go
come
on
you're
the
one
who
sees
everything
aren't
you
well
let's
see
what
we
can't
do
about
that
xander
come
on
now
it's
a
simple
story
stop
me
if
you've
heard
it
i
have
found
and
truly
believe
that
there
is
nothing
so
bad
it
cannot
be
made
better
with
a
story
and
this
one's
got
a
happy
ending
there
once
was
a
woman
and
she
was
foul
like
all
women
for
adam's
rib
was
dirty—just
like
adam
himself—for
what
was
he
but
human
but
this
woman
she
was
filled
with
darkness
despair
and
why
because
she
did
not
know
she
could
not
see
she
didn't
know
the
good
news
the
glory
that
was
coming
that'd
be
you
for
the
kingdom
the
power
and
the
glory
are
yours
now
and
forever
you
show
up
they'll
get
in
line
'cause
they
followed
her
and
all
they
have
to
do
is
take
one
more
step
and
i'll
kill
them
all
see
i
told
you
it
had
a
happy
ending
