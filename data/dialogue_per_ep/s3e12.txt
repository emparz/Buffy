gotcha
uhh
right
in
the
heart
satisfied
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
word
okay
i
didn't
mean
'satisfied'
like
no
i
i
wasn't
trying
to
'cause
we're
not
having
satisfaction
in
the
personal
sense
of
course
i
should
go
giles
is
is
waiting
for
you
i
know
thanks
for
the
workout
um
am
i
gonna
see
you
this
weekend
you
uh
youyou
probably
have
plans
right
birthday
um
actually
i
i
do
have
a
thing
oh
a
thing
a
date
nice
attempt
at
casual
actually
i
do
have
a
date
older
man
very
handsome
he
likes
it
when
i
call
him
'daddy'
huh
your
father
it
is
your
father
right
he's
taking
me
to
the
ice
show
which
should
be
big
fun
i
could
use
a
little
fun
this
one
amethyst
used
for
breath
mints
charm
bags
money
spells
and
for
cleansing
one's
aura
okay
so
how
do
you
know
if
one's
aura's
dirty
somebody
come
by
with
a
finger
and
write
'wash
me'
on
it
buffy
i'm
aware
of
your
distaste
for
studying
vibratory
stones
but
since
it
is
part
of
your
training
i
would
appreciate
your
glibfree
attention
sorry
it's
just
with
faith
on
one
of
her
unannounced
walkabouts
i
feel
like
somebody
should
be
patrolling
well
faith
is
not
interested
in
proper
training
so
i
must
rely
on
you
to
keep
up
with
yours
i
hate
being
the
good
one
and
as
for
patrolling
well
you'll
be
there
soon
enough
why
so
anxious
i
guess
it
i
just
have
some
energy
to
burn
well
in
due
time
but
uh
for
the
present
if
it's
not
entirely
beyond
your
capabilities
try
to
concentrate
wow
that
was
really
funnylooking
could
you
do
it
again
i'll
kill
you
for
that
for
that
what
were
you
trying
to
kill
me
for
before
okay
so
here's
the
deal
lemme
know
if
i'm
not
doing
this
right
bit
early
in
the
day
giles
something's
wrong
wrong
ah
perhaps
you
shouldn't
on
top
of
that
i
got
a
bad
case
of
the
dizzies
last
night
and
almost
let
a
vamp
stake
me
with
my
own
stake
i'm
way
off
my
game
my
game's
left
the
country
it's
in
cuernavaca
giles
what's
going
on
here
well
perhaps
you've
got
a
bad
flu
bug
or
something
no
no
not
sick
i
can't
get
sick
my
dad's
coming
to
take
me
to
the
ice
show
we
do
it
every
year
for
my
birthday
if
i
cancel
it's
gonna
break
his
heart
well
just
um
take
it
easy
for
fortyeight
hours
you
know
forego
patrolling
until
you
feel
yourself
again
no
no
i
just
need
to
spend
a
little
more
time
training
i'm
gone
thank
you
an
ice
show
a
show
performed
on
ice
and
how
old
are
we
again
i
went
to
snoopy
on
ice
when
i
was
little
my
dad
took
me
backstage
and
i
got
so
scared
i
threw
up
on
woodstock
look
i
know
you
guys
think
it's
just
a
big
dumb
girlie
thing
but
it's
not
i
mean
a
lot
of
those
skaters
are
olympic
medal
winners
and
every
year
my
dad
buys
me
cotton
candy
and
one
of
those
souvenir
programs
that
has
all
the
pictures
and
okay
it's
a
big
dumb
girlie
thing
but
i
love
it
it's
not
so
girlie
ice
is
cool
it's
water
but
it's
not
i
think
it's
sweet
you
and
your
dad
have
a
tradition
especially
now
that
he's
not
around
so
much
ix
nay
on
the
caramel
corn
though
if
you
go
backstage
we're
still
talking
party
right
i
mean
some
of
us
still
love
to
relish
celebrating
in
the
birth
of
the
buff
i
dunno
i
think
it
might
be
time
to
put
a
moratorium
on
parties
in
my
honor
they
tend
to
go
badly
monsters
crash
people
die
but
eighteen
is
a
big
one
buffy
i
mean
you
can
vote
now
you
can
be
drafted
you
can
vote
not
to
be
drafted
i
think
i'll
choose
to
celebrate
this
one
with
quiet
reflection
where
is
it
written
that
quiet
reflection
can't
be
combined
with
cake
and
funny
hats
buffy
present
ooo
present
uh
they're
not
they're
from
your
father
his
uh
quarterly
projections
are
unraveling
and
he
can't
afford
to
take
off
right
now
he
promises
to
make
it
up
to
you
it's
all
right
there
in
the
letter
iif
you
want
i
could
ask
somebody
to
cover
for
me
at
the
gallery
ii
mean
if
you
want
me
to
take
you
no
no
that's
not
necessary
ii
was
just
thinking
it
might
be
nice
to
have
a
quiet
birthday
how
much
longer
hobson
five
maybe
six
hours
sir
once
you
finish
you
and
blair
can
get
some
rest
but
sleep
in
shifts
we're
getting
very
close
the
slayer's
preparation
is
nearly
complete
you
know
it's
not
just
cartoon
characters
they
do
pieces
from
operas
and
ballets
brian
boitano
doing
carmen
is
a
life
changer
oh
he
doesn't
actually
play
carmen
but
a
lot
of
sophisticated
people
go
yes
i
think
we
should
start
with
the
grounding
crystal
again
you
know
it's
usually
something
that
families
do
together
now
look
very
carefully
for
the
tiny
flaw
at
its
core
iif
someone
were
free
they'd
take
their
daughters
or
their
student
or
their
slayer
hmm
yes
but
buffy
i
think
we
should
concentrate
now
now
look
for
the
flaw
at
its
center
buffy
oh
i'm
sorry
did
i
zone
out
on
you
it's
just
i'm
nursing
that
flu
bug
it's
best
to
take
care
of
that
perhaps
we
should
um
call
it
a
night
yeah
that's
a
good
idea
thanks
good
night
so
how's
it
going
with
amy
the
rat
good
she
loves
her
new
exercise
wheel
she
runs
around
her
nose
wiggles
ii
meant
how's
it
going
changing
her
back
into
a
human
being
oh
still
working
on
it
but
i
just
got
her
the
cutest
little
bell
you
don't
do
that
to
me
i
waited
for
you
at
the
bronze
all
night
and
the
big
deal
is
you
made
me
look
like
some
kind
of
dork
in
front
of
my
posse
first
of
all
'posse'
passe'
second
of
all
anyone
with
a
teaspoon
of
brains
knows
not
to
take
my
flirting
seriously
especially
with
my
extenuating
circumstances
what
circumstances
rebound
look
it
up
hey
i'm
not
through
here
oh
i
beg
to
differ
what
is
wrong
with
you
ow
god
the
chick
started
it
are
you
okay
okay
i
just
got
swatted
down
by
some
noneck
and
rescued
by
cordelia
what
the
hell
is
happening
i'm
sure
it'll
sort
itself
out
you're
not
getting
the
big
picture
here
ii
have
no
strength
i
have
no
coordination
i
throw
knives
like
a
girl
like
i'm
not
the
slayer
look
buffy
i
i
i
assure
you
um
given
time
wwwe'll
get
to
the
bottom
of
of
whatever's
causing
this
um
anomaly
promise
me
yes
i
give
you
my
word
you're
having
doubts
cruciamentum
is
not
easy
for
slayer
or
watcher
but
it's
been
done
this
way
for
a
dozen
centuries
whenever
a
slayer
turns
eighteen
it's
a
timehonored
rite
of
passage
it's
an
archaic
exercise
in
cruelty
to
lock
her
in
this
if
any
one
of
the
council
still
had
actual
contact
with
a
slayer
they
would
see
but
i'm
the
one
in
the
thick
of
it
which
is
why
you're
not
qualified
to
make
this
decision
you're
too
close
that's
not
true
a
slayer
is
not
just
physical
prowess
she
must
have
cunning
imagination
a
confidence
derived
from
selfreliance
and
believe
me
once
this
is
all
over
your
buffy
will
be
stronger
for
it
or
she'll
be
dead
for
it
rupert
if
this
girl
is
everything
you
say
then
you've
nothing
to
worry
about
uh
sir
if
you
can
spare
me
for
a
short
spell
i'll
need
to
make
a
run
to
the
hardware
store
i
just
need
some
take
care
of
it
come
on
come
on
kralik
your
pills
open
your
mouth
that's
enough
close
it
up
aha
a
curse
on
slayers
oh
no
wait
iit's
lawyers
you
know
maybe
we're
on
the
wrong
track
with
the
whole
spell
curse
and
whammy
thing
maybe
what
we
should
be
looking
for
is
something
like
um
slayer
kryptonite
faulty
metaphor
kryptonite
kills
you're
assuming
i
meant
the
green
kryptonite
i
was
referring
of
course
to
the
red
kryptonite
which
drains
superman
of
his
powers
wrong
the
gold
kryptonite's
the
powersucker
the
red
kryptonite
mutates
superman
into
some
sort
of
weird
guys
reality
buffy
i
know
you
are
definitely
without
a
doubt
gonna
get
your
powers
back
thanks
will
but
what
if
you
don't
okay
if
i
don't
get
my
powers
back
then
i
don't
i'll
deal
and
there's
a
whole
lotta
good
sides
to
it
actually
this
could
open
up
so
many
giles
did
you
find
anything
uh
no
not
yet
it's
your
shift
pills
yes
it's
coming
pills
take
them
pills
they're
right
in
front
of
you
where
here
i
can't
see
can't
can't
reach
it
open
your
eyes
shh
everything's
okay
now
thank
you
that's
beautiful
you
really
like
it
of
course
i
do
it's
sweet
and
thoughtful
and
full
of
neat
words
to
learn
and
say
like
'wilt'
and
'henceforth'
then
why'd
you
seem
more
excited
last
year
when
you
got
a
severed
arm
in
a
box
i'm
sorry
uh
it's
just
suddenly
there's
this
chance
that
my
calling's
a
wrong
number
and
it's
just
freaking
me
out
a
little
that's
understandable
angel
what
if
i
have
lost
my
power
you
lived
a
long
time
without
it
you
can
do
it
again
i
guess
but
what
if
i
can't
i've
seen
too
much
i
know
what
goes
bump
in
the
night
not
being
able
to
fight
it
what
if
i
just
hide
under
my
bed
all
scared
and
helpless
or
what
if
i
just
become
pathetic
hanging
out
at
the
old
slayer's
home
talking
people's
ears
off
about
my
glory
days
showing
them
mr
pointy
the
stake
i
had
bronzed
buffy
you
could
never
be
helpless
or
boring
not
even
if
you
tried
don't
be
so
sure
before
i
was
the
slayer
i
was
well
i
i
don't
wanna
say
shallow
but
let's
say
a
certain
person
who
will
remain
nameless
we'll
just
call
her
spordelia
looked
like
a
classical
philosopher
next
to
me
angel
if
i'm
not
the
slayer
what
do
i
do
what
do
i
have
to
offer
why
would
you
like
me
i
saw
you
before
you
became
the
slayer
what
i
watched
you
and
i
saw
you
called
it
was
a
bright
afternoon
out
in
front
of
your
school
you
walked
down
the
steps
and
and
i
loved
you
why
'cause
i
could
see
your
heart
you
held
it
before
you
for
everyone
to
see
and
i
worried
that
it
would
be
bruised
or
torn
and
more
than
anything
in
my
life
i
wanted
to
keep
it
safe
to
warm
it
with
my
own
that's
beautiful
or
taken
literally
incredibly
gross
i
was
just
thinking
that
too
ah
you're
up
i
was
afraid
i
drained
you
too
much
i
do
that
sometimes
ever
have
a
tune
you
can't
get
outta
your
head
it
keeps
playing
over
and
over
and
over
drives
me
nuts
ahh
thank
you
ohh
that
is
much
better
mmm
it's
a
game
you
know
we're
not
gonna
play
by
their
rules
but
that
doesn't
mean
we're
not
gonna
play
mmm
why
don't
you
call
your
friend
in
we'll
discuss
it
over
dinner
quentin
hello

find
out

girl
how
much
for
a
lap
dance
for
me

of
myself

arm

hurt
so
much
i
can't
be
just
a
person
i
can't
be
helpless
like
that
giles
please
we
have
to
figure
out
what's
happening
to
me
it's
an
organic
compound
of
muscle
relaxants
and
adrenal
suppressers
the
effect
is
temporary
you'll
be
yourself
again
in
a
few
days
you
it's
a
test
buffy
it's
given
to
the
slayer
once
she
uh
well
if
she
reaches
her
eighteenth
birthday
the
slayer
is
disabled
and
then
entrapped
with
a
vampire
foe
whom
she
must
defeat
in
order
to
pass
the
test
the
vampire
you
were
to
face
has
escaped
his
name
is
zackary
kralik
as
a
mortal
he
murdered
and
tortured
more
than
a
dozen
women
before
he
was
committed
to
an
asylum
for
the
criminally
insane
when
a
vamp
you
bastard
all
this
time
you
saw
what
it
was
doing
to
me
all
this
time
and
you
didn't
say
a
word
i
wanted
to
liar
in
matters
of
tradition
and
protocol
i
must
answer
to
the
council
my
role
in
this
was
very
specific
i
was
to
administer
the
injections
and
to
direct
you
to
the
old
boardinghouse
on
prescott
lane
i
can't
i
can't
hear
this
buffy
please
who
are
you
how
could
you
do
this
to
me
i
am
deeply
sorry
buffy
and
you
have
to
understand
if
you
touch
me
i'll
kill
you
you
have
to
listen
to
me
because
i've
told
you
this
the
test
is
invalidated
you
will
be
safe
now
i
promise
you
now
whatever
i
have
to
do
to
deal
with
kralik
and
to
win
back
your
trust
you
stuck
a
needle
in
me
you
poisoned
me
what's
going
on
oh
god
is
the
world
ending
i
have
to
research
a
paper
on
bosnia
for
tomorrow
but
if
the
world's
ending
i'm
not
gonna
bother
you
can't
walk
home
alone
buffy
it
isn't
safe
i
don't
know
you
did
something
take
her
memory
cordelia
could
you
please
drive
me
home
of
course
but
if
the
world
doesn't
end
i'm
gonna
need
a
note
buffy
mother
mother
may
i
call
you
mother
my
own
mother
was
a
person
with
no
selfrespect
of
her
own
so
she
tried
to
take
mine
ten
years
old
she
had
the
scissors
you
wouldn't
believe
what
she
took
with
those
but
she's
dead
to
me
now
mostly
because
i
killed
and
ate
her
but
also
because
i
know
i
won't
be
alone
much
longer
i'll
have
your
daughter
i
won't
kill
her
i'll
just
make
her
like
me
i
have
a
problem
with
mothers
i'm
aware
of
that
i
was
just
trying
to
reach
you
i
was
on
watch
over
by
the
boardinghouse
then
you
know
what's
happened
yes
he's
killed
hobson
and
made
blair
one
of
his
own
your
perfectly
controlled
test
seems
to
have
spun
rather
impressively
out
of
control
don't
you
think
it
changes
nothing
well
then
allow
me
i've
told
buffy
everything
that
is
in
direct
opposition
to
the
council's
orders
yes
interestingly
i
don't
give
a
rat's
ass
about
the
council's
orders
there
will
be
no
test
the
test
has
already
begun
your
slayer
entered
the
field
of
play
about
ten
minutes
ago
why
i
don't
know
i
returned
there
just
as
she
entered
now
giles
we've
no
business
this
is
not
business
hide
and
seeeek
hide
and
seek
why
did
you
come
to
the
dark

congratulations

extraordinary

in
battle
the
council

very
pleased
do
i
get
a
gold
star
i
understand
that
you're
upset
you
understand
nothing
you
set
that
monster
loose
and
he
came
after
my
mother
you
think
the
test
was
unfair
i
think
you
better
leave
town
before
i
get
my
strength
back
we're
not
in
the
business
of
fair
miss
summers
we're
fighting
a
war
you're
waging
a
war
she's
fighting
it
there
is
a
difference
mr
giles
if
you
don't
mind
the
test
is
done
we're
finished
not
quite
she
passed
you
didn't
the
slayer
is
not
the
only
one
who
must
perform
in
this
situation
i've
recommended
to
the
council
and
they've
agreed
that
you
be
relieved
of
your
duties
as
watcher
immediately
you're
fired
on
what
grounds
your
affection
for
your
charge
has
rendered
you
incapable
of
clear
and
impartial
judgment
you
have
a
father's
love
for
the
child
and
that
is
useless
to
the
cause
it
would
be
best
if
you
had
no
further
contact
with
the
slayer
i'm
not
going
anywhere
no
well
i
didn't
expect
you
would
adhere
to
that
however
if
you
interfere
with
the
new
watcher
or
countermand
his
authority
in
any
way
you
will
be
dealt
with
are
we
clear
oh
we're
very
clear
congratulations
again
bite
me
yes
well
colorful
girl

can't
believe
giles
was
fired
how
could

get
fired
so

did
you
manage
to
kill
kralik
oh
she
was
very
clever
uh
you
go
ahead
and
tell
it
dear
you
tell
it
better
now
now
when
you
say
'fired'
do
you
mean
'fired'
you're
not
cruising
past
that
concept
any
time
soon
are
you
well

just
i
mean

been
fired

writing
an
angry
letter

nothing's
really
gonna

the
important
thing
is
that
i
kept
up
my
special
birthday
tradition
of
gutwrenching
misery
and
horror
bright
side
to
everything
just
feel
better
when
i
get
my
strength
back

you
a
hand
with
that
little
lady

a
big
strong
man

gimme
a
hand
with
