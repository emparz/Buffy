power
to
the
people
you
sound
like
a
child
of
the
seventies
what
we're
saying
is
we're
in
charge
in
charge
of
ourselves
ok
you
guys
let's
just
try
not
to
freak
out
all
i'm
saying
is
now
that
buffy's
not
here
we
finally
have
some
say
in
how
and
when
we
lose
our
necks
maybe
you
don't
have
to
be
so
blunt
about
the
losing
of
the
necks
bit
no
let
the
girl
speak
the
truth
we're
all
on
death's
door
repeatedly
ringing
the
doorbell
like
maniacal
girl
scouts
trying
to
make
quota
you
know
i'm
thinking
that
everyone
here
shouldn't
have
a
say
we
just
have
to
find
some
way
of
having
constructive
dialogue
without
going
completely
mad
do
you
know
the
parliamentary
procedure
'cause
that's
a
convenient
way
of
organizing—
i
just
wonder
if
those
of
us
who
have
been
here
longer
should
have
more
of
a
say
maybe
we
should
break
down
into
small
groups
so
it
wouldn't
be
so
chaotic
faith
what
do
you
think
when
i
was
involved
with
the
model
un
we
found
the
parliamentary
procedure
to
be
a
total
lifesaver
for
example
once
when
i
was
uruguay—anyway
one
of
those
u
countries—it
was
like
here
only
we
had
this
system
which
allowed
us
to
organize
our
conversation
she's
going
to
be
fine
really
it's
for
the
best
yeah
then
why
do
i
feel
like
this
i
hear
what
you're
saying
but—
shouldn't
we
get
down
to
business
you
guys
i
think
we're
wasting
time
arguing
about
how
to
argue
well
why
don't
we—
please
do
not
mention
parliamentary
procedure
i
second
that
everyone
listen
to
me
chill
all
right
it's
been
a
long
night
and
i
don't
know
about
you
but
i'm
wiped
maybe
we
should
catch
some
sleep
and
figure
all
this
out
in
the
morning
do
we
really
have
time
to
waste
look
i
understand
you
guys
are
wicked
stressed
frankly
our
situation
blows
we've
got
to
stay
cool
that's
the
only
way
we're
going
to
get
through
this
can
everyone
handle
that
yeahyeahwe'll
get
some
rest
and
then
tomorrow
things
won't
seem
so—
the
lights
went
out
i'll
get
some
candles
if
we
have
candles
i'll
check
the
fuse
box
don't
bother
all
the
lights
on
the
whole
street
just
went
out
which
means
that
the
people
from
the
power
company
have
got
the
hell
out
of
sunnydale
i
think
i'm
freaking
out
don't
move
get
out
of
my
house
hey
i
thought
the
place
would
be
empty
i
was
looking
for
a
place
to
crash
you
know
you
really
should
leave
ou
can't
just
kick
me
out
of
my
own
house
why
not
it's
what
all
the
cool
kids
are
doing
nowadays
this
is
not
your
house
it's
not
your
town
not
anymore
got
any
tab
i
spy
with
my
little
eye
something
that
begins
with
a
t
tapestry
hey
good
one
how
did
you—
tapestry's
the
only
thing
in
the
whole
bloody
room
ahso
say
you
but
i
say
look
deeper
i'll
look
deep
into
your
jugular
is
what
i'll
look
at
don't
spazz
out
i'm
not—
don't
say
another
word
rock
paper
scissors
what's
the
matter
with
you
don't
you
understand
what's
happening
uhyeah
we're
waiting
here
till
it's
night
again
so
you
can
ride
on
your
motorcycle
without
exploding
and
every
minute
we're
stuck
here
the
slayer's
out
there
facing
hell
knows
what
come
on
what's
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
to
her
all
right
so
what
do
we
know
well
we
know
we're
basically
the
last
humans
left
in
sunnydale
and
that
all
the
evil
in
town
wants
us
dead
i
don't
want
to
die
don't
worry
it's
far
more
likely
you'll
live
long
enough
to
watch
most
of
your
friends
die
first
and
then
you'll
die
we
also
know
that
caleb
told
buffy
that
everything's
going
down
at
the
seal
i
think
we
should
head—
let's
not
get
ahead
of
ourselves
so
we
know
we've
got
a
lot
of
enemies
we'll
start
there
faith
i'm
sorry—
i
got
this
ok
so
let's
go
over
our
rogues'
gallery
who
exactly
do
we
have
here
well
there's
the
first
who
we
can't
touch
then
there's
our
friend
the
reverend
ihatewomen
who's
basically
untouchable
there's
the
'roidrage
vamps
who
are
pretty
much
the
worst
and
the—
bringersi
think
they're
our
weakest
link
are
you
thinking
of
attacking
the
bringers
maybe
or
ok
we
could
kidnap
one
and
what
hold
it
ransom
yeah
i'll
get
the
magazines
and
start
ripping
out
the
letters
now
dear
mr
first
if
you
want
your
bringer
back
well
we'll
be
surprised
because
you
got
like
3
million
of
them
so
please
disregard
this
letter
yours
sincerely—
i'm
saying
we
think
about
getting
us
a
bringer
and
making
it
talk
find
out
info
on
the
first
and
caleb
that
way
how
do
you
think
we
should
catch
one
if
they
don't
want
to
be
found
ok
i'm
not
sure
this
is
such
a
good
idea
why
try
and
get
information
when
we
already
know
about
the
seal
why
don't
we
send
a
team
to
the
high
school
do
some
recon
and—
no
just
like
that
you're
not
even
listening
sweetie
you're
pushing
too
hard
i
thought
things
would
be
different
now
but
you
keep
shutting
me
down
things
are
different
because
now
i'm
your
boss
look
you
guys
i'm
not
buffy
i'm
not
the
one
who's
been
on
your
asses
all
this
time
but
i'm
not
one
of
you
anymore
either
i'm
your
leader
which
means
i
go
first
and
i
make
the
rules
and
the
rest
of
you
follow
after
me
is
that
clear
so
kennedy
back
the
hell
off
and
let
me
do
my
job
all
right
ok
let's
get
down
to
business
i
was
hoping
you'd
bring
me
some
better
news
and
i
wish
i
had
some
is
this
going
to
do
anything
or
is
all
of
this
just
to
make
the
bringers
sweat
do
the
bringers
sweat
actually
i
think
they
pant
like
dogs
and
i
don't
know
if
this
is
going
to
do
any
good
but
we
have
to
try
everything
you
realize
what
will
happen
if
the
slayer
and
her
girls
get
it
don't
you
they
won't
that's
right
they
won't
because
you're
going
to
kill
all
of
them
and
everyone
they
know
hallelujah
i've
never
been
the
bait
before
that
was
uh
actually
kind
of
scary
we
had
your
back
you
did
well
your
performance
as
a
disgruntled
minion
was
spot
on
i'm
method
let's
get
this
back
to
the
captain
oh
hey
so
uh
the
bringer's
dumb
you
were
expecting
what
a
rhodes
scholar
dumb
as
in
mute
someone
ripped
out
its
tongue
oh
gross
heyi've
been
reading
this
old
turkish
spell
book
there's
an
old
conjuration
that
the
ancient
turks
used
to
communicate
with
the
dying
oh
yeah
i
think
i've
read
a
translation
of
it
there's
a
translation
of
it
i'm
over
it
um
so
the
spell
is
used
to
communicate
with
people
who
can't
talk
um
like
if
a
person
was
dying
this
spell
would
let
them
say
their
goodbyes
or
you
know
gripe
about
how
nobody
came
to
visit
them
would
this
help
us
with
mr
notongue
yeah
i
think
so
i
just
need
to
get
together
a
few
ingredients
all
right
well
cool
while
willow
does
that
the
rest
of
us
can—
we're
back
spike
hey
hi
everybody
i
missed
you
guys
a
lot
sorry
it
took
so
long
to
get
back
from
our
missionmission
but
we
had
to
wait
out
the
sun
well
i
think
our
mission
went
very
well
we
uh
we
rode
on
spike's
hog
which
was
very
cool
and
uh
uh
played
some
amusing
games
and—oh
we
got
some
new
information
you
know
what
i
really
need
to
urinate
he's
a
breath
of
fresh
air
isn't
he
thank
god
i
don't
breathe
so
i
think
we
got
a
lead
where's
buffy
um
she's
not
here
right
now
when's
she
get
back
uhwhile
you
were
gone
we
all
got
together
and
ttalked
out
some
disagreements
that
we
were
having
um
and
eventually
after
much
discussion
buffy
decided
that
it
would
be
best
for
all
of
us
if
she
took
a
little
time
off
a
little
breather
uhhuh
i
see
been
practicing
that
little
speech
long
have
you
so
uh
buffy
took
some
time
off
right
in
the
middle
of
the
apocalypse
and
it
was
her
decision
well
we
all
decided
oh
yeah
you
all
decided
you
sad
sad
ungrateful
traitors
who
do
you
think
you
are
we're
her
friends
we
just
want—
oh
that's
ballsy
of
you
you're
her
friends
and
you
betray
her
like
this
you
don't
understand—
you
know
i
think
i
do
rupert
you
used
to
be
the
big
man
didn't
you
the
teacher
all
full
of
wisdom
now
she's
surpassed
you
and
you
can't
handle
it
she
has
saved
your
lives
again
and
again
she's
died
for
you
and
this
is
how
you
thank—
hey
why
don't
you
take
it
down
a
notch
or
two
the
time
for
speechgiving
is
over
bat
boy
oh
is
that
right
yeah
that's
right
save
your
lack
of
breath
all
right

pretty
sweet
on
her
aren't
you
i
think
it's
cute
they
way
she's
got
you
whipped
enough
finally
got
what
you
wanted
didn't
you
where

little
andrew
quiet
i
don't

guys
that
should
have
worked
i
am
a
drone
in
the
mind
that
is
evil
could
you
just
shut
up
i
say
i'm
part
of
the
great
darkness
somebody
needs
a
reality
check
or
a
muzzle
wait
i'm
only
a
fragment
of
the
we
we
work
as
one
to
serve
the
first
ok
what
do
you—the
we—do
for
the
first
we
work
to
prepare
for
the
inevitable
battle
how
tell
me
exactly
what
the
bringers
are
doing
kennedy
he
can't
see
the
knife
we
can
feel
the
knife
kennedy
we
attend
to
the
needs
of
the
infinite
evil
we
exterminate
girls
and
destroy
the
legacy
of
the
slayer
we
build
an
arsenal
beneath
the
dirt
we
obey
the
commands
of
our
teacher
caleb
wait
could
we
go
back
to
the
dirt
thing
we
build
weapons
to
prepare
for
the
coming
war
at
the
farthest
edge
of
town
we
are
everywhere
we
are
like
the
ocean's
waves
we
watch
your
efforts
and
are
not
scared
we
will
laugh
at
you
as
you
die
what
the
bananas
you
are
so
lucky
that
you
did
not
just
magically
decapitate
me
we've
got
enough
here
we
need
to
get
faith
in
on
this
xander
gather
some
maps
we
need
to
find
a
subterranean
space
large
enough
to
house
an
armory
i
feel
used
and
violated
and
i
need
a
lozenge
there
you
are
do
you
realize
i
could
just
walk
in
here
no
invite
needed
this
town
really
is
theirs
now
isn't
it
i
heard
i
was
over
there
that
bitch
she's
all
about
smiles
and
reformation
when
you're
on
your
feet
but
the
moment
you're
down
she's
all
about
the
kicking
isn't
that
right
makes
me
want—
it
wasn't
just
faith
it
was
all
of
them
and
it's
not
like
they
were
wrong
please
leave
no
this'll
change
your
tune
i
came
here
'cause
i
got
something
to
tell
you
you
were
right
caleb
is
trying
to
protect
something
from
you
and
i
think
you
were
spot
on
all
the
way
i
think
it's
at
the
vineyard
so
you
were
right
buffy
i
don't
feel
very
right
you're
not
fooling
me
what
do
you
even
mean
well
you're
not
a
quitter
watch
me
you
were
their
leader
and
you
still
are
this
isn't
something
you
gave
up
it's
something
they
took
and
the
difference
is
we
can
take
it
back
sewer
tunnel
on
the
north
side's
closest
so
guess
we'll
start
there
sounds
fine
what
time
shall
i
tell
everyone
how
about
around
700
700
sharp
so
tomorrow
we
fight
tomorrow
good
night
faith
faith
yeah
you're
doing
just
fine
i'd
say
better
than
fine
i'd
say
you're
doing
a
bangup
job
get
out
well
gosh
i
think
you
know
a
hello
or
a
nice
to
see
you
might
be
a
little
more
welcome
it's
the
end
of
humanity
faith
not
the
end
of
courtesy
you're
wasting
your
time
i
know
who
you
are
what
you
are
yeah
yeah
nobody's
explained
to
you
how
this
works
have
they
you
see
i
am
part
of
the
first
as
you
kids
call
it
but
i'm
also
me
richard
wilkins
iii
late
mayor
and
founder
of
sunnydale
here
i'll
prove
it
to
you
ask
me
a
question
only
i
know
the
answer
to
something
like
where
did
i
hide
the
moon
pies
in
my
office
or
who
was
my
favorite
character
in
little
women
meg
i
know
i
know
most
people
guess
beth
but
meg
she's
such
a
proper
young
lady
remember
when
jo
burned
her
hair
i
know
what
you're
doing
and
it's
not
going
to
work
but
feel
free
to
keep
talking
'cause
hell
i
could
listen
to
you
yap
all
night
hey
hey
hey
hey
hey
language
you're
a
leader
now
you
keep
throwing
the
hedouble
hockey
sticks
around
pretty
soon
the
girls
are
going
to
pick
up
on
it
then
what
you
let
me
worry
about
the
girls
of
course
of
course
you're
doing
a
great
job
with
them
by
the
way
much
better
than
buffy
ever
did
you
were
smart
to
kick
her
out
that's
not
what
we—
buffy
got
them
this
far
why
are
you
protecting
her
you
think
she
cares
about
you
she
nearly
killed
you
faith
it's
different
now
no
matter
what
you
do
buffy
will
always
see
you
as
a
killer
not
as
a
person
and
now
you
have
what
she
so
desperately
wants
the
respect
of
these
girls
all
she
needs
is
an
excuse
and
she'll
finish
what
she
started
when
she
stuck
that
knife
in
your
belly
you
stay
on
guard
faith
buffy's
dangerous
if
you're
not
careful
she'll
destroy
you
i'm
just
saying
no
no
you
mean
no
as
in
eventually
you
really
have
problems
with
that
word
don't
you
you
can
get
them
back
can
maybe
should
i'm
just
so
tired
they
need
you
well
i
it's
bloody
chaos
over
there
without
you
it
is
yeah
yeah
it's
uh
there's
junk
you
know
food
cartons
sleeping
bags
not
rolled
up
everyone's
very
scared
and
uh
unkempt
sounds
dire
i
didn't
see
a
lot
i
came
hit
faith
a
bunch
of
times
and
left
really
i
mean
not
that
i'm
glad
but—
oh
you
say
the
word
and
she's
a
footnote
in
history
i'll
make
it
look
like
a
painful
accident
that's
my
problem
i
say
the
word
some
girl
diesevery
time
there's
always
casualties
in
war
casualties
it
just
sounds
socasual
these
are
girls
that
i
got
killed
i
cut
myself
off
from
themall
of
them
i
knew
i
was
gonna
lose
some
of
them
and
i
didn't—
you
know
what
i'm
still
making
excuses
i've
always
cut
myself
off
i've
always—
being
the
slayer
made
me
different
but
it's
my
fault
i
stayed
that
way
people
are
always
trying
to
connect
to
me
and
i
just
slip
away
you
should
know
i
seem
to
recall

me
i've
been
alive
a
bit
longer
than

dead
a
lot
longer
than
that
i've
seen
things
you
couldn't
imagine
and
done
things
i
prefer
you
didn't
i
don't
exactly
have
a
reputation
for
being
a
thinker
i
follow
my
blood
which
doesn't
exactly
rush
in
the
direction
of
my
brain
so
i
make
a
lot
of
mistakes
a
lot
of
wrong
bloody
calls
a
100+
years
and
there's
only
one
thing
i've
ever
been
sure
of
you
hey
look
at
me
i'm
not
asking
you
for
anything
when
i
say
i
love
you
it's
not
because
i
want
you
or
because
i
can't
have
you
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
i
love
what
you
are
what
you
do
how
you
try
i've
seen
your
kindness
and
your
strength
i've
seen
the
best
and
the
worst
of
you
and
i
understand
with
perfect
clarity
exactly
what
you
are
you're
a
hell
of
a
woman
you're
the
one
buffy
i
don't
wanna
be
the
one
i
don't
wanna
be
this
good
looking
and
athletic
we
all
have
crosses
to
bear
you
get
some
rest
now
i'll
check
in
before
first
light
you
can
decide
how
you
want
spike
could
youstay
here
sure
that
diabolical
old
torture
device
the
comfy
chair
it'll
do
me
fine
no
i
meanhere
will
you
just
hold
me
deep
down
you
always
wanted
buffy
to
accept
you
to
love
you
even
why
do
you
think
that
is
you
a
shrink
now
you
keep
looking
for
love
and
acceptance
from
these
people
these
friends
of
yours
but
you're
never
gonna
find
it
the
truth
is
nobody
will
ever
love
you
not
the
way
i
love
you
get
out
they'll
forever
see
you
as
a
killer
i
said
get
out
i'll
always
be
with
you
firecracker
in
everything
you
do
faith
you
shouldn't
sneak
up
like
that
i
almost
took
your
head
off
sorry
i
knocked
who—what'd
you
see
just—you're
looking
spooked
what
happened
are
you
sure
you're
all
right
oh
what
you
wanna
rap
about
my
problems
now
are
you
looking
to
be
the
guy
who
puts
the
pal
in
principal
for
me
ok
you
know
what
i
came
up
here
to
talk
to
you
about
weapons
sorry
i
don't
know
what
i'm
doing
i'm
just—
listen
i'm
gonna
leave
you
alone
i
didn't
mean
to
intrude
it
was
the
first
well
you're
really
in
the
game
now
faith
the
first
doesn't
show
itself
unless
it
thinks
you
matter
lucky
me
i'm
a
player
man
look
at
that
my
hand's
shaking
demons
vampires
women
in
the
penitentiary
system—none
of
that
freaks
me
out
that's
exactly
what
the
first
does—finds
your
achilles'
heel
nah
it
just
talked
to
me
what
it
does
a
heal
thing
too
um
it's
a
phrase
your
weak
spot
oh
school
thing
i
was
kinda
absent
that
decade
so
who
was
it
the
first
he
was
like
an
old
boss
of
mine
just
a
boss
and
he's
got
you
shaking
like
this
wouldn't
give
you
a
raise
huh
yeah
right
well
it
sounds
retarded
but
he
was
like
a
dad
to
me
oh
it
was
my
mother
when
it
came
to
me
and
i
mean
it
was
her
right
down
to
the
perfume
sorry
yeah
i'm
just
so
pissed
off
at
myself
i
knew
it
was
a
trick
yeah
so
did
i
but
i
still
wanted
my
mother
to
hold
me
like
a
little
baby—
in
a
manly
way
of
course
of
course
listen
nobody
wants
to
be
alone
faith
we
all
want
someone
who
cares
to
be
touched
that
way
i
mean
the
first
deals
in
figments
but
that
wanting
is
real
hitting
things
and
a
whole
lot
of
jack
d
dulls
it
some
among
other
things
when
it
came
to
you
did
the
first
tell
the
truth
yeah
it
said
to
watch
out
for
buffy
that
buffy's
dangerous
well
what
do
you
think
could
be
i
mean
we've
given
her
pretty
good
reason
to
be
pissed
off
you
know
the
messed
up
thing
the
first
is
telling
me
to
worry
about
her
and
i
just
wish
she
was
here
in
a
couple
hours
i'm
gonna
lead
these
girls
into
some
serious
crap
and
she's
the
only
one—
she's
not
the
only
one
you're
a
slayer
too
faith
and
i
think
you're
a
good
leader
i'm
an
excon
who
didn't
finish
high
school
yeah
well
i'm
the
principal
of
a
school
where
nobody
finished
and
i
am
completely
out
of
my
league
in
this
well
i
hear
otherwise
so
um
tomorrow
then
forget
about
tomorrow
this
is
tonight
it's
been
a
while
am
i
out
of
line
no
you're
the
leader
ok
guys
giles
said
faith
wants
us
to
start
early
in
the
morning
so—
what
happened
to
the
girls
looks
like
there's
only
one
girl
here
what
about
the
other
ones
with
their
sleeping
bags
and
their
headgear
and
their
snoring
they're
not
here
are
they
nope
well
that's
nice
nice
and
necessary
come
here
you
foreplay
was
threatening
to
turn
into
twelveplay
something
not
right
no
no
i
just
uh
guess
i'm
a
little
scared
it's
probably
stupid
to
ask
why
huh
death
war
apocalypse
me
i'm
just
scared
that
if
we
and
then
i'll
and
then
and
then
isn't
that
the
good
part
good
yeah
ggood
feeling
but
also
bad
stuff
like
unrestrained
moaning
and
screaming
with
joy
well
sort
of
the
unrestrained
part
but
i've
just—i've
kind
of
been
in
this
space
where
i
should
be
restrained
i've
been
controlling
myself
and
i—
if
i
lose
that
control
let
myself
go
i
could
just
go
hm
you
worried
you're
gonna
turn
into
big
bad
willow
it's
not
stupid
when
we
first
kissed
i
turned
intowarren
it's
not
stupid
but
it's
not
gonna
happen
i
just
want
you
to
know
you're
safe
with
me
yeah
you
can
float
around
and
i'll
tether
you
down
you'll
be
like—like
my
kite
string
mmhmm
you'll
be
a
kite
and
i'll
be
your
kite
string
ok
ok
ok
mmmcome
here
they
could
show
a
little
respect
you
know
hm
i
mean
they
should
at
least
acknowledge
the
fact
that
some
people
might
not
want
to
listen
to
an
a
capella
concert
of
people
you
know
moaning
and
groaning
hm
disgusting
is
what
it
is
little
jealous
huh
of
course
i
am
i'm
a
lot
jealous
i
mean
if
we're
done
having
sex
then
i
think
other
people
should
just
knock
it
off
i
used
to
think
that
i
knew
what
we
needed
i
envy
them
isn't
that
the
strangest
thing
well
it
does
throw
me
a
tad
i
mean
they're
just—why
they're
barely
more
than
animals
feeding
off
each
other's
flesh—it's
nauseating
but
you
you're
everywhere
you're
in
the
hearts
of
little
children
you're
in
the
souls
of
the
rich
you're
the
fire
that
makes
people
kill
and
hate
the
fire
that
will
cure
the
world
of
weakness
they're
just
sinners
you
are
sin
i
do
enjoy
your
sermons
and
you're
in
me
give
me
strength
no
man
can
have
and
the
only
man
strong
enough
to
be
my
vessel
and
i
know
you
feel
me
but
i
know
why
they
grab
at
each
other
to
feel
i
want
to
feel
i
want
to
wrap
my
hands
around
some
innocent
neck
and
feel
it
crack
amen
so
it
turned
out
that
all
these
stone
tablets
basically
said
the
same
thing
the
first
and
caleb
are
protecting
something
and—and
we
don't
know
exactly
what
it
is
but
it's
something
powerful
and
they
don't
want
the
slayers
to
get
it
i'm
thinking
it
could
be
a
weapon
and
if
we're
looking
for
an
arsenal—
you're
not
coming
if
one
is
looking
for
an
arsenal
what
better
place
to
find
a—
weapon

a
pleasure
faith
back

you

need
you

the
situation
on

don't

matter
letting
