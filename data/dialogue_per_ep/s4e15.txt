they
smell
good
don't
they
the
camera
pulls
back
and
we
see
faith
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
matching
buffy's
movements
what
clean
sheets
like
summer
i
wouldn't
know
right
i
forgot
i
noticed
ii
wish
i
could
stay
but
oh
you
have
to
go
it's
just
with
little
sis
coming
i
know
so
much
to
do
before
she
gets
here
now
i
really
have
to
so
go
don't
let
me
keep
damn
just
when
we
made
it
so
nice
are
you
ever
gonna
take
this
thing
out
so
here
it
is
the
latest
in
stateoftheart
combat
technology
i
gotta
say
it
doesn't
look
that
complicated
the
camera
pulls
back
and
we're
in
xander's
basement
he
has
the
weapon
on
the
counter
willow
is
standing
next
to
him
with
tools
in
her
hands
should
he
need
them
buffy
is
standing
behind
them
behind
her
giles
is
seated
on
the
couch
folding
a
basket
of
laundry
on
the
coffee
table
so
can
you
repair
it
sure
as
soon
as
i
get
my
master's
degree
in
advanced
starship
technology
well
why
don't
we
experiment
press
some
buttons
see
what
happens
uh
ii'd
like
to
veto
that
second
it's
called
a
blaster
will
a
word
that
tends
to
discourage
experimentation
now
if
it
were
called
the
orgasmator
i'd
be
the
first
to
try
your
basic
button
press
approach
just
tell
me
can
you
repair
it
or
not
but
if
i
blow
a
hole
in
my
mom's
azalea
patch
the
neighbors
will
not
be
pleased
are
you
alright
you've
been
patrolling
round
the
clock
for
three
days
straight
now
i
thought
you
could
use
some
what
some
rest
there's
a
demonoid
killing
machine
out
there
giles
it
doesn't
only
work
the
night
shift
i
was
going
to
say
perhaps
you
could
use
some
backup
but
um
now
you
mention
it
building
up
your
strength
may
not
be
a
bad
idea
just
get
the
blaster
working
that's
all
the
strength
i
need
are
you
sure
why
because
ray
guns
aren't
in
the
slayer
handbook
well
you
haven't
seen
this
adam
thing
he's
the
terminator
without
the
bashful
charm
he's
deadly
and
the
last
time
we
met
he
kicked
my
ass
oh
no
blast
away
by
all
means
i
only
meantno
word
about
riley
they
keep
telling
me
that
he's
fine
that's
all
they'll
say
maybe
they're
telling
the
truth
maybe
i
don't
even
know
what
the
initiative's
version
of
fine
is
they
could
be
forcing
him
back
onto
medication
and
torturing
him
for
all
i
know
from
what
we've
seen
i
doubt
they'll
be
trying
to
hurt
him
the
only
thing
i
know
for
certain
is
that
my
boyfriend
is
locked
away
and
i'm
not
helping
maybe
giles
has
a
point
i
mean
riley
is
their
top
gun
guy
doesn't
make
sense
that
they'd
hurt
him
all
i
know
is
that
the
initiative
has
all
those
brainwashy
behaviour
modification
guys
so
so
what
happens
when
they
start
not
liking
his
behaviour
stand
down
soldier
stand
down
before
i
put
you
down
you
heard
the
man
at
ease
the
shish
kebab
that
walks
like
a
man
looks
like
you're
feeling
better
walking
around
threatening
people
and
all
that
man
was
in
my
way
i
got
places
to
be
really
and
where
were
you
thinking
of
going
you
know
where
i'm
going
don't
even
tell
me
you're
heading
toward
that
girlfriend
of
yours
look
at
you
one
good
conjugal
visit
and
you're
back
in
intensive
care
to
stay
you
wouldn't
understand
how
about
you
explain
it
to
me
then
we
all
friends
here
fellas
absolutely
riley
here
is
about
to
explain
why
he's
leaving
us
so
very
quickly
i
don't
explain
because
i
don't
have
to
i'm
the
one
in
charge
things
change
do
they
hey
in
case
you
failed
to
notice
we're
in
a
world
of
hurt
around
here
now's
the
time
for
us
to
band
together
not
go
flying
off
our
separate
ways
forrest
has
a
point
riley
we
have
a
problem
we
deal
with
that
problem
you
know
the
most
important
part
of
the
equation
now
is
that
we
keep
said
problem
within
the
family
family
is
that
what
we
are
step
aside
think
it's
gonna
rain
nonsense
it's
a
beautiful
day
now
eat
your
sandwich
i
dunno
it
just
always
seems
like
it
starts
raining
about
now
you're
too
young
and
too
pretty
a
girl
to
start
wearing
worry
lines
on
your
face
well
hey
hey
hey
hey
there
little
fella
heh
i
don't
know
where
you
belong
but
it's
not
here
with
us
there
you
go
you
see
there's
nothing
that's
gonna
spoil
our
time
together
who
wants
cheesecake
no
no
i
told
you
i
had
things
to
do
spread
out
not
too
far
so
not
a
problem
i've
never
seen
anything
like
that
and
i
can
go
a
long
healthy
stretch
without
seeing
anything
like
that
again
it
had
to
be
adam
who
killed
it
but
why
he's
studying
biology
human
demon
whoever
he
can
get
his
hands
on
and
take
apart
he's
finding
out
what
makes
things
work
i
really
don't
want
to
be
around
for
the
final
exam
it's
not
coming
to
that
the
initiative
created
this
thing
and
they
can't
stop
it
but
we
will
question
will
hiding
in
a
cavern
with
stockpiled
chocolate
goods
be
any
part
of
this
plan
no
told
you
what's
first
riley
i'm
not
leaving
him
down
there
with
the
people
that
created
this
thing
i
don't
care
how
many
guns
they
have
i'm
going
in
okay
will
i
need
you
to
hack
into
their
security
mainframe
and
buy
me
a
ten
minute
shut
down
of
operation
systems
that
could
be
tricky
not
impossible
if
you
can't
do
it
online
then
use
magic
xander
any
gear
you've
been
saving
for
a
rainy
day
i
want
you
to
give
to
me
you
want
stealth
stuff
no
we
tried
sneaking
in
this
time
we're
gonna
use
force
i
figure
i'll
go
in
through
the
elevator
shaft
use
the
cable
as
towlines
then
blast
open
the
facility
doors
and
find
the
infirmary
am
i
really
worth
all
that
riley
oh
god
i'm
sorry
did
i
hurt
you
no
a
giant
skewer
through
the
rib
cage
hurt
me
that
was
just
a
reminder
how
did
you
get
out
i
walked
they
didn't
try
to
stop
you
oh
they
did
repeatedly
but
then
i
told
them
they
couldn't
keep
me
without
a
major
asskicking
one
way
or
another
so
here
i
am
that'sgreatriley
and
y'knowthere's
no
polite
way
to
ask
you
this
butuhdid
they
put
a
chip
in
your
brain
beg
your
pardon
forget
it
we're
just
happy
to
have
you
back
yeah
we
were
pretty
worried
about
you
for
a
while
mister
me
too
hey
i
know
my
behaviour
was
pretty
out
there
forget
it
tell
you
what
you
two
crazy
kids
take
down
a
killer
cyber
demon
hybrid
thingy
and
we'll
call
it
all
even
taking
down
adam's
gonna
be
tough
there's
no
way
to
predict
what
he'll
throw
at
us
you're
here
whatever
comes
we
can
handle
ouch
excuse
me
you
know
how
to
get
to
third
floor
west
what
i
seeyou
need
some
help
or
something
graduation
what
graduation
i
gotta
get
to
sunnydale
high
school
graduation
now
well

i
mean
sunnydale
high
school

even
there
anymore

day
is
it
friday
what
date
the
date
february
25th
what
year
maybe
i
should
get
you
a
nurse
what
happened
to
the
school
don't
you
just
wanna
just
tell
me
well
it
was
a
tragedy
really
lots
of
students
died
the
principal
the
mayor
i
really
think
maybe
i
should
get
you
some
help
y'know
i
never
stopped
thinking
about
you
me
neither
all
i
had
in
there
was
this
one
little
part
of
you
it's
just
the
scarf
part
of
me
really
sure
it
is
just
knowing
you
were
out
therethat
you
caredi
think
we're
being
watched
i
dunno
does
the
initiative
do
that
maybe
you
seem
a
littlesomewhere
else
is
there
anything
i
can
do
give
me
an
order
that's
what
i
do
isn't
it
follow
orders
you
don't
have
to
don't
i
all
my
life
that's
what
i've
been
groomed
to
do
they
say
jump
i
ask
how
high
i
get
the
job
done
just
don't
know
if
it's
the
right
job
anymore
i
know
how
you
feel
giles
used
to
be
part
of
this
council
and
for
years
all
they
ever
did
was
give
me
orders
ever
obey
them
sure
the
ones
i
was
going
to
do
anyway
the
point
is
i
quit
the
council
and
i
was
scared
but
it's
okay
now
now
see
that's
where
you
and
i
are
different
i
just
suck
at
the
whole
gray
area
thing
it's
a
choice
go
back
in
there
and
make
some
changes
from
the
inside
or
you
can
quit
the
team
fight
demons
in
your
own
way
you
make
it
sound
so
simple
i
don't
even
know
what
my
way
is
well
it's
time
to
find
out
i'm
a
soldier
i
got
a
way
which
one
of
them
good
man
what're
you
doing
i
am
looking
for
brain
washy
chips
in
your
head
hehfinding
any
not
sure
but
i
should
probably
keep
looking
just
in
case
you've
been
strong
long
enough
riley
finn
i'm
here
for
you
and
we're
gonna
find
this
demon
and
we're
gonna
kill
it
together
and
in
the
meantime
you
are
gonna
stop
torturing
yourself
sure
about
that
it's
an
order
what
do
you
mean
she
just
wasn't
there
i
don't
know
i
came
to
check
the
monitors
like
i
always
do
at
eight
o'clock
eight
o'clock
is
my
shift
i
got
here
on
time
you
found
the
bed
in
this
condition
haven't
touched
a
thing
get
the
duty
rosters
and
check
the
log
i
wanna
know
exactly
what
happened
coma
patients
do
not
just
get
up
and
walk
away
we
are
checking
every
room
on
every
floor
walk
me
through
this
one
more
time
you
knew
this
woman
was
wanted
for
questioning
on
a
series
of
murders
and
there's
no
security
on
this
wing
you
don't
understand
there's
no
way
that
girl
was
gonna
wake
up
doctor
this
can't
be
happening
did
you
find
her
another
woman
unconscious
and
badly
beaten
and
she's
been
stripped
it's
happened
send
the
team
the
problem
for
me
seems
to
be
why
adam
ahs
stayed
dormant
as
long
as
he
has
when
he's
not
making
performance
art
out
of
other
demons
that
is
he's
probably
working
off
an
autonomic
power
source
and
because
he's
straight
out
of
the
box
he
needs
to
charge
up
a
while
okay
what's
he
charging
up
for
based
on
the
clues
i'll
go
with
killing
spree
and
that's
a
best
case
scenario
i
suppose
a
little
firepower
would
be
a
good
idea
right
now
hey
how'd
you
do
that
is
there
like
an
onoff
button
somewhere
here
blasters
are
easy
adam
won't
be
since
professor
walsh
designed
it
any
chance
she
left
instructions
lying
around
somewhere
well
if
she
did
they're
gonna
be
in
the
initiative
which
we
can't
get
into
without
mounting
a
major
offensive
speak
for
yourself
i'm
just
saying
i
must
admit
a
man
on
the
inside
would
be
a
really
good
idea
are
you
sure
you
wanna
be
double
agent
guy
i'm
not
exactly
sure
what
you'd
call
me
but
i
will
share
information
it's
the
least
i
can
do
riley's
right
it
is
the
least
we
can
do
hello
what
yes
she
is
umit's
for
you
hello
what
sort
of
emergency
no
i
haven't
thank
you
i'll
let
you
know
what
is
it
it's
faith
she's
awake
she
beat
someone
up
took
her
clothing
and
disappeared
out
of
the
hospital
no
one
knows
where
she
is
i'd
say
this
qualifies
for
a
worst
timing
ever
award
what
do
we
do
well
we
have
to
find
her
what
about
adam
i'd
hate
to
see
the
pursuit
of
a
homicidal
lunatic
get
in
the
way
of
pursuing
a
homicidal
lunatic
well
faith's
not
exactly
lowprofile
girl
i'll
patrol
and
wait
for
her
to
make
a
move
but
then
what
oooh
i
have
an
idea
beat
the
crap
out
of
her
good
plan
good
on
paper
but
we
still
have
a
decision
to
make
do
we
hand
her
over
to
the
cops
they
wouldn't
know
what
to
do
with
a
slayer
even
if
they
knew
we
existed
what
about
the
council
been
there
tried
that
not
unlike
smothering
a
forest
fire
with
napalm
as
i
recall
well
the
initiative
they
do
have
containment
facilities
one
word
evil
there's
no
way
around
it
faith
is
back
and
whether
i
like
it
or
not
she's
my
responsibility
yeah
too
bad
that
was
out
first
coma
ever
we
have
no
idea
where
she
is
we
don't
know
what
she's
thinking
what
she's
feeling
who
she's
doing
she
could
be
terrified
maybe
she
doesn't
even
remember
or
maybe
she
does
and
she's
sorry
and
she's
alone
hiding
somewhere
well
perhaps
there's
some
form
of
rehabilitation
we
just
haven't
thought
about
and
if
not
asskicking
makes
a
solid
plan
b
i'm
not
going
to
rule
it
out
first
thing
we
need
to
find
her
then
we
can
take
it
from
there
who's
faith
what
did
you
tell
him
the
truth
that
she's
my
wacky
identical
cousin
from
england
and
whenever
she
visits
hijinks
ensue
it's
good
you
guys
have
such
an
honest
relationship
no
i
told
him
the
story
i
vagued
up
a
few
bits
but
no
flatout
lies
that's
fair
how'd
you
handle
the
angely
parts
i
did
some
editing
it's
not
that
i'm
trying
to
hide
anything
from
riley
it's
just
that's
a
longer
conversation
and
i
had
a
faithhunt
to
do
any
luck
couldn't
find
her
don't
know
exactly
where
to
place
that
little
upcontinuum
at
least
you're
not
alone
on
this
i
bet
every
cop
in
sunnydale
is
out
there
looking
for
her
right
now
pressure's
definitely
on
i'm
telling
you
if
i
were
her
i'd
get
outta
dodge
post
hasty
but
you're
not
me
so
check
you
out
b
nice
the
big
girl
on
campus
thing's
really
working
for
you
i've
been
looking
for
you
i've
been
standing
still
for
eight
months
b
how
hard
did
you
look
are
you
alright
fivebyfive
it's
that
thing
about
a
coma
wake
up
all
rested
and
rejuvenated
and
ready
for
payback
so
much
for
pleasantries
huh
what
did
you
think
i'd
wake
up
and
we'd
go
for
tea
you
tried
to
gut
me
bonny
lets
have
another
go
at
it
see
who
ends
on
top
it
doesn't
have
to
be
like
this
y'know
actually
i
think
it
has
to
be
exactly
like
this
faith
these
are
innocent
people
no
such
animal
i
guess
it
was
too
much
to
hope
that
you'd
use
your
downtime
to
reflect
and
grow
i
could
say
the
same
about
you
i
mean
you're
still
the
same
betterthanthou
buffy
i
mean
i
knew
it
somehow
i
kept
having
this
dream
i'm
not
sure
what
it
means
but
in
the
dream
the
selfrighteous
blond
chick
stabs
me
and
you
wanna
know
why
you
had
it
coming
that's
one
interpretation
but
in
my
dream
she
does
it
for
a
guy
try
it
red
and
you'll
lose
an
arm
i
wake
up
to
find
the
blond
chick
isn't
even
dating
the
guy
she
was
so
nuts
about
before
i
mean
she's
moved
on
to
the
first
college
beefstick
she
meets
not
only
has
she
forgotten
about
the
love
of
her
life
but
she's
forgotten
about
the
chick
she
nearly
killed
for
him
so
that's
my
dream
that
and
some
stuff
about
cigars
and
a
tunnel
but
tell
me
college
girl
what
does
it
mean
to
me
mostly
that
you
still
mouth
off
about
things
you
don't
understand
uhoh
i
guess
somebody
knows
you're
here
you
took
my
life
b
payback's
a
bitch
look
who's
talking
see
you
around
thanks
for
coming
with
hunting
for
a
psychopathic
superbitch
is
definitely
in
the
above
and
beyond
category
it's
okay
really
so
what
do
we
do
if
we
find
her
run
flee
maybe
skedaddle
we're
not
here
to
engage
this
is
strictly
recon
what
you
said
recon
you're
like
cool
monster
fighter
well
technically
faith
isn't
a
monster
and
as
far
as
fighting
i'd
be
lucky
to
bruise
her
fist
with
my
face
oh
what
facepunching
i'm
not
so
good
with
the
whole
swimming
violence
don't
worry
we're
sure
to
spot
faith
first
she's
like
this
cleavagy
slutbomb
walking
around
ooh
check
me
out
i'm
wickedcool
i'm
fivebyfive
fivebyfive
five
what
by
five
what
see
that's
the
thing
noone
knows
buffy
can
handle
faith
and
you're
plenty
safe
with
me
so
umwe
recon
till
nightfall
then
the
ritual
hiding
begins
the
point
being
i
could
be
the
target
here
faith
finds
mr
xander
harris
still
in
town
she
goes
tighter
than
cat
gut
got
a
lotta
pentup
feelings
there
i'm
only
saying
yes
i'm
sure
see
i
can't
be
held
responsible
for
the
effect
i
have
on
women
no
see
faith
and
i
have
this
little
thing
between
us
called
history
spike
what
are
you
doing
here
me
hey
i'm
not
the
one
out
of
place
here
for
your
information
smarty
we've
got
a
rogue
slayer
on
our
hands
real
psychokiller
too
sounds
serious
it
is
what
do
you
know
what
do
you
need
her
dark
hair
yay
tall
name
of
faith
criminally
insane
have
you
seen
her
is
this
bird
after
you
in
a
bad
way
yeah
tell
you
what
i'll
do
then
i'll
head
out
find
this
girl
tell
her
exactly
where
you
are
and
then
watch
as
she
kills
you
can't
any
one
of
your
damn
little
scooby
club
at
least
try
to
remember
that
i
hate
you
all
just
because
i
can't
do
the
damage
myself
doesn't
stop
me
from
aiming
a
loose
cannon
your
way
and
here
i
thought
the
evening
be
dull
go
ahead
you
wouldn't
even
recognise
her
dark
hair
this
tall
name
of
faith
criminally
insane
like
this
girl
already
we're
dumb
faith
your
friend
sent
me
i
got
a
little
remembrance
from
him
hello
faith
if
you're
watching
this
tape
it
can
only
mean
one
thing
i'm
dead
and
our
noble
campaign
to
bring
order
to
the
town
of
sunnydale
has
failed
utterly
and
completely
but
on
the
other
hand
heck
maybe
we
won
and
right
now
i'm
on
some
jumbo
monitor
in
the
richard
wilkins
surrounded
by
a
bunch
of
kids
sitting
indian
style
and
looking
up
at
my
face
filled
with
fear
and
wonder
hi
kids
but
the
realist
in
me
tends
to
doubt
it
now
faith
as
i
record
this
message
you're
sleeping
and
the
doctors
tell
me
you
might
never
wake
up
i
don't
believe
that
sooner
or
later
you
will
wake
up
and
when
you
do
you'll
find
the
world
has
gone
and
changed
on
you
i
wish
i
could
make
the
world
a
better
place
for
you
to
wake
up
in
but
tough
as
it
is
to
accept
we
both
have
to
understand
that
even
my
power
to
protect
and
watch
over
you
has
its
limits
see
the
hard
pill
to
swallow
is
that
once
i'm
gone
your
days
are
just
plain
numbered
now
i
know
you're
a
smart
and
capable
young
woman
in
charge
of
her
own
life
but
the
problem
faith
is
that
there
won't
be
a
place
in
the
world
for
you
anymore
by
now
i
bet
you're
feeling
very
much
alone
but
you're
never
alone
you'll
always
have
me
and
you'll
always
have
this
go
ahead
open
the
box
don't
worry
it's
not
gonna
bite
that's
my
job
go
ahead
open
it
surprise
you
won't
find
these
in
any
gumball
machine
see
when
you've
been
around
as
long
as
i
have
you
amke
friends
and
some
of
them
forge
neat
little
gizmos
just
like
the
one
you're
holding
right
now
and
here's
the
good
news
just
because
it's
over
for
my
faith
doesn't
mean
she
can't
go
out
with
a
bang
she's
a
very
dangerous
woman
okay
i
get
it
faith
bad
do
i
look
like
i'm
arguing
not
yet
but
you
always
make
that
innocent
face
right
before
you
start
figured
it
out
huh
damn
it
took
my
mom
twelve
years
to
catch
that
one
all
i'm
saying
is
if
you're
in
trouble
i
wanna
help
you
can't
give
me
one
reason
why
that's
one
alright
i'm
not
exactly
action
guy
but
there's
gotta
be
something
i
can
do
other
than
sit
around
waiting
for
you
to
pummel
this
gal
riley
the
fact
that
you
just
called
faith
a
gal
only
proves
that
you
don't
know
her
never
seen
anyone
get
under
your
skin
this
way
before
what
exactly
did
she
do
to
you

a
criminally
insane
woman
out
there

a
pair
on

to
talk
that
way
i
mean
in
the
world
according
to
joyce
buffy

gonna
come
crashing
through
that
door

summers
buffy
summers

buffy
buffy
lotta
letters
she
hasn't
been

a
while

you'd
think
with
a
crazy
chick
like
me
on
the
loose
crazy
chick
with
a
wicked
grudge
against
her
no
less
she'd
call
give
you
a
headsup
but
buffy's
too
into
her
own
deal
to
remember
dear
old
mom
you
don't
know
the
first
thing
about
buffy
or
me
don't
i
i
know
what
it's
like
you
think
you
matter
you
think
you're
a
part
of
something
and
you
get
dumped
it's
like
the
whole
world
is
moving
and
you're
stuck
it's
like
those
animals
in
the
tar
pits
it's
like
you
just
keep
sinking
a
little
deeper
everyday
and
noone
even
sees
were
you
planning
to
slit
my
throat
any
time
soon
don't
tell
me
you
don't
see
it
joyce
you've
served
you
purpose
squirted
out
the
kids
raised
her
up
and
now
you
might
as
well
be
dead
nobody
cares
nobody
remembers
especially
not
buffy
fabulous
superhero
sooner
or
later
you're
going
to
have
to
face

long
time

busy
climbing
onto
her
new
boytoy

a
good
roll
in
the
sack

not
big
on
sleaze

something
to
remember
me
by
once
i've
moved
