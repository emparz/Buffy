your
friend
don't
be
afraid
to
use
it
what
just
waiting
for
my
moment
situation
still
normal
well
or
as
normal
as
this
school
ever
sees
so
it
appears
well
no
fires
no
one's
head's
going
kablooey
and
the
swing
choir
and
the
marching
band
have
gone
back
to
their
normal
healthy
seething
resentment
yeah
it's
been
pretty
quiet
around
here
since
you
shut
down
that
seal
you
just
may
have
stopped
this
thing
buffy
no
it
can't
be
that
easy
you
call
that
easy
hey
any
apocalypse
i
avert
without
dying
yeah
those
are
the
easy
ones
you
know
you're
uhyou're
something
else
miss
summers
you
know
i've
been
watching
you
when
you're
out
patrolling
and
you
um—
you
remind
me
of
my
um
your
mother
yeah
yeah
what
i
remember
of
her
anyway
got
to
tell
you
not
a
line
every
girl
likes
to
hear
but—in
this
case—
compliment
taken
maybe
you're
right
maybe
everything
is
fine
everything's
terrible
total
catastrophe
giles
what's
wrong
have
you
seen
the
new
library
there's
nothing
but
computers
there's
not
a
book
to
be
seen
i—i
don't
know
where
to
begin
buffy
i
mean
who
do
we
speak
to
uh
that
would—that
would
be
me
hi
i'm
robin
wood
oh
sorry
rupert
giles
sorry
buffy
tells
me
you're
something
of
a
freelance
demon
fighter
oh
yes
yes
i
um
i'm
relieved
we're
running
dangerously
low
on
allies
so
we
didn't
stop
it
then
uh
no
the
seers
at
the
coven
are
certain
the
first
is
continuing
to
gather
its
forces
i'm
afraid
war
is
inevitable
so
we
should
go
before
the
school
board
what
well
i
can
have
my
backup
library
sent
from
home
in
the
mean
time
it's
not
much
but—
giles
knowledge
comes
from
crafted
bindings
and
pages
buffy
not
ones
and
zeros
so
did
you
bring
back
any
potentials
um
no
actually
mmy
uh
my
trip
is
about
something
elseregarding
spike
spike
what
about
him
i
told
you
my
concerns
when
you
recklessly
chose
to
remove
the
chip
from
his
head
wait
sorry
chip
uh
it's
a
long
story
the
military
put
a
chip
in
spike's
head
so
he
couldn't
hurt
anyone
and
that
would
be
the
abridged
version
but
he
wouldn't
hurt
anyone
anymore
because
he
has
a
soul
now
unless
the
first
triggers
him
again
triggers
the
chip
no
the
trigger's
a
posthypnotic
thing
the
first
put
it
in
his
head
it
was—made
him—
he
was
killing
again
so
he
has
a
trigger
a
soul
and
a
chip
not
anymore
it
was
killing
him
giles
the
trigger
no
the
chip
the
trigger's
not
active
anymore
because
the
military
gave
him
a
soul
sorry
we
don't
know
that
the
trigger
is
inactive
what
i
brought
back
may
help
us
to
disarm
it
to
ascertain
exactly
what
it
is
that
causes
spike's
behavior
it
was
that
song
giles
i'm
telling
you
it
was
that
song
that
spike
was
singing
he
has
no
memory
of
it
is
there
any
part
of
it
that
you
can
remember
it
wasn't
like
it
had
a
catchy
hook
or
anything
like
i'm
coming
up
so
you
better
get
this
party
started
it
was
boring
old
and
english
just
like
you—ull
yule
brenner
a
british
yule
brenner
this
thing
you
brought
to
keep
spike
from
killing
again
how's
it
work
well
it
will
require
a
bit
of
magic
no
we
couldn't
have
put
these
chains
back
up
a
week
ago
nah
we
gotta
work
on
spike
now
of
all
times
what
nothing
what
are
you
doing
here
you
came
to
see
the
show
i
thought
you
might
need
support
uhhuh
right
let's
get
this
over
with
what're
you
gonna
do
some
hypnobeam
a
disarming
spell
not
exactly
the
first
has
brainwashed
you
there's
something
in
your
subconscious
that
it's
using
to
provoke
a
violent
reaction
so
we
have
to
put
this
in
your
brain
bugger
that
the
prokaryote
stone
will
move
within
your
mind
to
reveal
the
root
of
the
trigger's
power
can
unleash
ideas
images
memories
hopefully
once
you
understand
what
it
is
that's
setting
you
off
you
can
break
its
hold
on
you
hopefully
so
it
might
not
work
the
stone's
just
a
catalyst
for
the
process
the
rest
is
up
to
spike
and
how
do
expect
to
get
that
hunk
of
rubble
into
my
cranium
willow
ok
i
just
hope
my
pronunciation
is
in
the
ballpark
kun'ati
belek
sup'sion
bok'vata
im
kele'beshus
ek'vota
mor'osh
boota'ke
oh
you
have
got
to
be
joking
what
now
it
has
to
access
the
cerebral
cortex
via
the
optic
nerve
oh
bollocks
with
all
the
rubbish
people
keep
sticking
in
my
head
it's
a
wonder
that
there's
room
for
my
brain
i
don't
think
it
takes
up
that
much
space
do
you
ow
oh
ow
spike
spike
listen
to
me
yeah
are
you
all
right
how
am
i
supposed
to
know
if
this
bugugly's
doing
its
job—
yet
her
smell
it
doth
linger
painting
pictures
in
my
mind
her
eyes
balls
of
honey
angel's
harps
her
laugh
oh
lark
grant
a
sign
if
crook'd
be
cupid's
shaft
hark
the
lark
her
name
it
hath
spake
cecily
it
discharges
from
twixt
its
wee
beak
oh
william
it's
justscribbling
nonsense
it's
magnificent
i
wonder
though
this
cecily
of
whom
you
write
so
often
oh
would
that
be
the
underwood's
eldest
girl
uh
no
uh
no
i
do
not
presume
she's
lovely
you
shouldn't
be
alone
you
need
a
woman
in
your
life
i
have
a
woman
in
my
life
but
you
ne—
oh
well
do
not
mistake
me
i
still
have
hopes
that
one
day
there
will
be
an
addition
to
this
household
but
i
will
always
look
after
you
mother
this
i
promise
should
i
send
the
coach
for
doctor
gull
i'll
be
all
right
it's
passed
just
sit
with
me
a
while
will
you
of
course
early
one
morning
just
as
the
sun
was
shining
i
heard
a
maid
sing
in
the
valley
below
dawn
get
these
sodding
things
off
me
i'm
fine
don't
you
think
you
should
take
a
little
time
calm
down
i
am
calm
this
stone
of
yours
is—is
out
right
did
its
job
so
i'm
detriggered
right
spike
what
do
you
remember
about
the
song
oh
yeah
the
song
it's
called
uh
early
one
morning
old
folk
ditty
what's
it
mean
to
you
mean
nothing
it's
just
uh
my
mum
it
was
her
favorite
she
used
to
sing
it
to
me
when
i
was
a
baby
and
no
and
that's
it
look
shouldn't
you
check
on
dawnie
i
clocked
the
niblet
pretty
fierce
she'll
be
ok
she's
tough
ow
i'm
sorry
doesn't
look
like
anything's
broken
did
you
use
some
sort
of
a
magic
xray
no
that's
just
what
people
usually
say
so
spike's
trigger's
been
active
this
entire
time
how
can
buffy
take
this
for
granted
i
mean
he
lives
in
our
house
we
train
with
him
don't
waste
your
time
down
that
road
spike's
got
some
sort
of
get
out
of
jail
free
card
that
doesn't
apply
to
the
rest
of
us
i
mean
he
could
slaughter
a
hundred
frat
boys
and—
forgiveness
makes
us
human
blahdeeblahblahblah
uh
willowcall
for
you
from
la
somebody
named
fred
the
guy
sounds
kind
of
effeminate
spike
listen
to
me
what
is
it
about
your
mother
i
don't
know
i
got
along
fine
with
her
she
was
a
nice
lady
well
there
has
to
be
more
than
that
well
there
bloody
well
isn't
what
are
you
doing
i'm
going
to
unchain
him
buffy
just—
this
is
pointless
giles
he
doesn't
know
anything
your
prophylactic
stone
didn't
work
because
he's
not
cooperating
this
process
takes
time
he's
blocking
whatever's
flooding
his
consciousness
and
what
he
does—he's
endangering
us
all
so
the
trigger's
still
working
much
as
ever
ooh
such
a
pretty
house
you
have
sweet
william
it
smells
of
daffodilsand
viscera
don't
get
too
attached
now
won't
be
here
for
long
luv
well
then
should
we
give
it
a
proper
goodbye
you're
a
saucy
one
aren't
you
druwe'll
bring
this
world
to
its
knees
it's
ripe
and
ready
my
darling
waiting
for
us
to
devour
its
fruit
we'll
ravage
this
city
together
my
pet
lay
waste
to
all
of
europe
the
three
of
us
will
teach
those
snobs
and
elitists
with
their
falderal
just
what—
three
you
me
and
mother
we'll
open
up
their
veins
and
bathe
in
their
blood
as
they
scream
our
names
across—
what
youyou
want
to
bring
your
mum
wif
us
well
yeah
you'll
like
her
to
eat
you
mean
william
uh
mother
where
have
you
been
i've
been
beside
myself
for
days
you
needn't
have
worried
mother
you'll
never
have
to
worry
about
anything
again
something
has
happened
i've
changed
i—i
don't—
who's
this
woman
i'm
the
other
that
gave
birth
to
your
son
i
beg
your
pardon
it's
true
mother
drusilla—sheshe
has
made
me
what
i
am
i
am
no
longer
bound
to
this
mortal
coil
i
have
become
a
creature
of
the
night
a
vampire
are
you
drunk
a
little
bit
think
of
it
no
more
sickness
no
more
dying
you'll
never
age
another
day
let
me
do
this
for
you
what
are
you
talking
about
aand
why
are
you
acting
so
strangely
it's
all
right
mother
it's
only
me
we'll
be
together
forever
william
it
only
hurts
for
a
moment
buffy
hey
i
uh
just
got
a
phone
call
i'm
gonna
have
to
take
off
for
a
while
maybe
a
day
or
two
what's
wrong
nothing
you
need
to
worry
about
i'll
give
you
the
full
scoop
later
maybe
i'll
even
bring
back
some
good
news
could
use
a
little
of
that
ok
i
guess
now
is
as
good
a
time
as
we're
likely
to
see
for
a
while
just
hurry
back
will
do
think
about
what
you're
doing
i
have
buffy
don't
mr
giles
you
got
a
moment
what's
on
your
mind
the
same
thing
that's
on
yours
we
got
ourselves
a
problem
spike
yeah
if
that
trigger's
still
working
then
the
first
must
be
waiting
for
just
the
right
time
to
use
it
against
us
it
does
seem
doubtful
the
first
simply
forgot
it
had
such
a
powerful
weapon
yeah
a
while
back
it
slipped
up
it
told
andrew
it
wasn't
time
yet
for
spike
so
whatever
the
first's
ultimate
plan
is
it's
obvious
that
spike
must
play
an
integral
part
in
that
something
needs
to
be
done
buffy
would
never
allow
it
buffy
would
listen
to
her
watcher
wouldn't
she
i
don't
think
you
have
much
of
an
idea
of
the
watcherslayer
dynamic
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
raised
by
a
watcher
you
were
bernard
crowley
took
me
in
when
i
was
a
young
kid
trained
me
crowley
i
remember
the
name
new
york
based
watcher
resigned
shortly
after
his
slayer
was—
you're
nikki
wood's
son
yes
spike
killed
your
mother
yes
does
buffy
know
this
she
knows
my
mother
was
a
slayer
shedoesn't
know
about
spike
and
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
personal
vengeance
does
it
matter
he's
an
instrument
of
evil
now
he's
gonna
prove
to
be
our
undoing
in
this
fight
buffy's
undoing
and
she
will
never—never
see
it
coming
now
i'm
talking
about
what
needs
to
be
done
for
the
greater
good
giles
and
you
know
i'm
right
what
exactly
do
you
propose
i
just
need
you
to
keep
buffy
away
for
a
few
hours
i
don't
know
giles
is
this
really
a
primo
time
for
a
training
session
i'm
still
your
teacher
buffy
as
adept
as
you
are
as
a
slayer
there
are
always
new
things
to
learn
now
more
than
ever
it's
crucial
to
maintain
focus
on
your
calling
in
case
you
haven't
noticed
our
plates
are
kinda
full
right
now
plus
i'm
not
really
sure
how
i
feel
about
leaving
spike
at
robin's
house
to
watch
over
him
for
what
its
worth
everyone
at
your
house
seemedquite
relieved
at
the
arrangement
um
buffy
uhwhile
i'm
not
technically
your
watcher
anymore
the
fact
that
your
life
is
such
chaos
only
underscores
the
importance
of
the
lessons
i
can
impart
to
you
fine
impart
away
we're
on
the
verge
of
war
it's
time
you
looked
at
the
big
picture
hello
all
i
do
is
look
at
the
big
picture
the
other
day
i
gave
an
inspirational
speech
to
the
telephone
repair
man
it
takes
more
than
rousing
speeches
to
lead
buffy
if
you're
going
to
be
a
general
you
need
to
be
able
to
make
difficult
decisions
regardless
of
cost
have
you
seen
me
with
those
girls
i
mean
the
way
i've
treated
my
friends
and
my
family
and
andrew
believe
me
i
know
how
to
make
hard
decisions
well
that's
what
we're
here
to
find
out
while
we
work
on
the
basics
you
live
in
the
garage
this
is
just
a
work
room
kind
of
my
uh
sanctuary
a
little
place
to
unwind
eh
a
hard
day's
prinipaling
got
you
down
you
need
a
place
to
cut
loose
let
your
hair
down—so
to
speak
what
the
bloody
hell
is
this
well
i
told
you
it's
my
um
sanctuary
it's
the
hell
mouth
spike
you
can
never
be
too
careful
just
um
stay
away
from
the
walls
and
you'll
be
all
right
it's
a
bit
much
isn't
it
what's
your
story
wood
no
story
really
just
trying
to
do
what's
right
make
a
difference
how
'bout
you
what
kind
of
man
are
you
spike
sorry
not
much
for
self
reflection
yeah
makes
sense
see
you
strike
me
as
the
kind
of
guy
who
just
careens
through
life
completely
oblivious
to
the
damage
he's
doing
to
everyone
around
him
that
right
oh
i
know
more
about
you
than
you
think
spike
see
i've
been
searching
for
you
for
a
very
very
long
time
ever
since
you
killed
my
mother
i've
killed
a
lot
of
people's
mothers
yeah
you'd
remember
mine
she
was
a
slayer
so
that's
it
innit
brought
me
here
to
kill
me
no
i
don't
wanna
kill
you
spike
i
wanna
kill
the
monster
who
took
my
mother
away
from
me
early
one
morning
just
as
the
sun
was
rising
i
hear
a
young
maid
sing
in
the
valley
below
oh
don't
deceive
me
oh
never
leave
me
how
could
you
use
a

the
lark

from
twixt
its
wee
beak
you
honestly
thought
i
could
bear
an
eternity
listening
to
that
twaddle
that's
right
dog
fight
back
i
feel
extraordinary
it's
as
though
i've
been
given
new
eyes

everything
mother
i
hate
to
be
cruel—
no
i
don't
i
used
to
hate
to
be
cruel
in
life
now
i
find
it
rather
freeing
nothing
less
will
pry
your
greedy
little
fingers
off
my
apron
strings
will
it
stop
please
ever
since
the
day
you
first
slithered
from
me
like
a
parasite
what're
you
s—
had
i
known
better
i
could
have
spared
myself
a
lifetime
of
tedium
and
just—
dashed
your
brains
out
when
i
first
saw
you
god
i
prayed
you'd
find
a
woman
to
release
me
but
you
scarcely
showed
an
interest
who
could
compare
to
your
doddering
housebound
mum
a
captive
audience
for
your
witless
prattle
whatever
i
was
that's
not
who
i
am
anymore
darling
it's
who
you'll
always
be
a
limp
sentimental
fool
it
hurts
don't
it
is
this
what
it
felt
like
when
you
beat
the
life
out
of
her
toyed
with
her
when
you
snapped
her
neck
don't
kill
him
yet
what
why
not
because
i'm
asking
you
not
to
would
you
let
this
vampire
live
if
he
began
saving
the
world
sure
seems
like
a
nice
enough
guy
thanks
no
problem
my
name's
richard
hi
rich
giles
we
had
this
conversation
when
i
told
you
that
i
wouldn't
sacrifice
dawn
to
stop
glory
from
destroying
the
world
ah
yes
but
things
are
different
aren't
they
after
what
you've
been
through
faced
with
the
same
choice
now
you'd
let
her
die
if
i
had
toto
save
the
world
yes
can
i
kill
this
guy
yet
no
so
you
really
do
understand
the
difficult
decisions
you'll
have
to
make
that
anyone
of
us
is
expendable
in
this
war
have
you
heard
my
speeches
that
we
cannot
allow
any
threat
that
would
jeopardize
our
chances
at
winning
yes
i
get
it
and
yet
there
is
spike
animal
like
you
never
cared
for
anyone
but
yourself

one
else
mattered
just
all
about
the
hunt

want
to
run

you
scamper
off
and
cry
to
your
new
little
trollop

be
able
to
love
her
think
you'll
be
able
to
touch
her
without
feeling
me
all
you
ever
wanted
was
to
be
back
inside
you
finally
got
your
wish
didn't
you
sank
your
teeth
into
me
an
eternal
kiss
no
i
only
wanted
to
make
you
well

wanted
your
hands
on
me
perhaps
you'd
like
a
chance
to
finish
off
what
you
started
i
love
you
i
did
not

talking
to
you

a
piss
about
your
mum

was
a
slayer
i
was
a
vampire
that's
the
way
the
game
is
played
game
she
knew
what
she
was
signing
up
for
well
i
didn't
sign
up
for
it
well
that's
the
rub
innit
you
didn't
sign
up
for
it
you
took
my
childhood
you
took
her
away
she
was
all
i
had
she
was
my
world
and
you
weren't
hers

how
many
people
they've
got
around
them

alone
life
of
the
chosen
one
the
rest
of
us
be
damned
your
mother
was
no
different
no
she
loved
me
but
not
enough
to
quit
though
was
it
not
enough
to
walk
away
for
you
i'll
tell
you
a
story
about
a
mother
and
son
see
like
you
i
loved
my
mother
so
much
so
i
turned
her
into
a
vampire
so
we
could
be
together
forever
she
said
some
nasty
bits
to
me
after
i
did
that
been
weighing
on
me
for
quite
some
time
but
you
helped
me
figure
something
out
you
see
unlike
you
i
had
a
mother
who
loved
me
back
when
i
sired
her
i
set
loose
a
demon
and
it
tore
into
me
but
it
was
the
demon
talking
not
her
i
realize
that
now
my
mother
loved
me
with
all
her
heart
i
was
her
world
early
one
morning
just
as
the
sun
was
rising
i
heard
a
young
maid
sing
in
the
valley
below
oh—
that's
a
nice
little
song
you
got
there
thanks
doc
you
cured
me
after
all
i
got
my
own
free
will
now
i'm
not
under
the
first's
or
anyone
else's
influences
now
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
before

kill
you
spike's
a
liability
buffy

realized
how
harmful
your
relationship
with

selfawareness

after
what
he's
done
to
you
in
the
past
it's
different
now
he
has
a
soul
and
the
first
is
exploiting
that
to
his
advantage
oh
my
god
you're
stalling
me
you're
keeping
me
away—
it's
time
to
stop
playing
the
role
of
general
and
start
being
one
this
is
the
way
wars
are
won
spike
what
happened
oh
my
god
i
gave
him
a
pass
let
him
live
on
account
of
the
fact
i
killed
his
mother
but
that's
all
he
gets
he
even
so
much
as
looks
at
me
funny

kill
him
i

my
mom
a
couple
years
ago

came
home
and

her
dead
on
the
couch

what
you
tried
to
do
but
she's
dead
because
he
murdered
her
i'm
preparing
to
fight
a

and
you're
looking
for
revenge
on
a
man
that
doesn't
exist
anymore

delude
yourself
that
man
still
exists
spike

the
strongest
warrior

are
gonna
need
him
if
we're
gonna
come
out
of
this
thing
alive

try
anything
again
he'll
kill
you

importantly
i'll
let
him
i
have
a
mission
to
win
this
war
to
save
the
world

don't
have
time
for
vendettas
the
mission
