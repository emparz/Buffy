there's
moments
in
your
life
that
make
you
that
set
the
course
of
who
you're
gonna
be
sometimes
they're
little
subtle
moments
sometimes
they're
not

show
you

of

i'd
ask
myself
what's
a
lady
of
your
station
doing
alone
in
an
alley
with
the
reputation
that
this
one
has
maybe
she's
lonely
in
that
case
i'd
offer
myself
as
escort
to
protect
you
from
harm

to
while
away

dull
hours
you're
very
gracious

often
been
said

challenge

of
an
honest
day's

pretty
thing

anxious
to

hello
rupert
giles
yes
doug
perren
thanks
for
coming
oh
not
at
all
it's
flattered
to
be
asked
i
spoke
with
lou
tabor
at
the
washington
institute
and
he
told
me
we
had
the
best
authority
on
obscure
relics
right
here
in
sunnydale
oh
he
may
have
uh
exaggerated
a
little
ah
is
this
the
this
is
our
baby
construction
workers
dug
it
up
outside
of
town
don't
have
a
clue
what
it
is
any
ideas
a
few
none
i'd
care
to
share
until
i
can
verify
you
have
uh
carbon
dated
it
the
results'll
be
back
in
a
couple
of
days
i'll
go
out
on
a
limb
and
say
old
um
yes
it
it
certainly
predates
any
uh
settlements
we've
read
about
um
may
may
i
yeah
sure
i
assume
you've
uh
you
haven't
tried
to
open
it
open
it
ah
i'll
be
damned
i
figured
it
was
solid
what
do
you
think
is
in
there
i
don't
know
well
i
guess
we
won't
know
until
we
open
it
up
yes
but
could
i
ask
um
would
you
wait
i
uh
you
don't
want
to
be
surprised
aas
a
rule
no
alright
you're
the
expert
but
i'm
pretty
damn
curious
though
yes
yes
so
am
i
tell
angel
i'm
gonna
kill
him
no
wait
i'm
gonna
kill
you
die
die
die
aah
mother
is
that
it
yeah
that's
it
scene
that's
exactly
how
it
happened
well
i
thought
it
was
riveting
uh
i
was
a
little
unclear
about
some
of
the
themes
the
theme
is
angel's
too
much
of
a
coward
to
take
me
on
faceto
face
and
the
other
theme
was
'buy
american'
but
it
uh
got
kind
of
buried
do
you
think
you're
ready
to
fight
angel
i
wish
people
would
stop
asking
me
that
yes
i'm
ready
i'm
also
willing
and
able
just
the
one
test
i
might
actually
pass
don't
say
that
you're
gonna
pass
everything
i
will
get
you
through
this
semester
if
i
have
to
sweat
blood
do
you
think
you're
likely
to
'cause
i'd
like
to
be
elsewhere
it
was
only
metaphor
blood
i
think
you'd
sweat
cute
blood
sixth
period

my
computer
class

really
got
the
teaching
bug
taking
over
computer

great
to
do
that
before
you
go
out
and
fail
in
the
real
world
that
way
you're
not
falling
back
on
something
you're
falling
well
forward

almost
sixtyfive
percent
of
that
was
actual
compliment
is
that
a
personal
best
gee
xander

are
you
gonna
teach

terrible
psst
psst
psst
psst
psst
psst
where
at
the
museum
a
tomb
with
a
surprise
inside
you
can
see
all
that
in
your
head
no
you
ninny
she
read
it
in
the
morning
paper
oh
my
that's
what's
been
whispering
to
me
sh
oh
yeah
don't
worry
though
soon
it'll
stop
soon
it'll
scream
waah
this
doesn't
make
any
sense
well
sure
it
does
see
oh
no
this
doesn't
make
any
sense
it's
senseless
it
is
but
at
least
you
know
that
so
you're
learning
yay
me
well
it
doesn't
matter
anyway
i
mean
when
in
the
real
world
am
i
ever
gonna
need
chemistry
or
history
or
math
or
the
english
language
okay
i
see
your
problem
i'm
a
moron
will
you
stop
that
you're
not
stupid
you've
just
had
a
lot
on
your
mind
you
can
learn
this
real
easily
but
if
you're
just
gonna
give
up
then
don't
waste
my
time
wow
you
really
are
a
good
teacher
okay
look
at
this
a
covalent
bond
which
means
these
two
atoms
are
linked
by
this
ohh
hold
that
thought
okay
i'm
learn
girl
okay
so
see
here
deja
vu
really
yeah
i
have
this
perfect
memory
of
the
pencil
and
oh
hey
you
dropped
this
it's
not
mine
it
might
be
something
of
ms
calendar's
this
feels
kinda
morbid
i've
gone
through
most
of
her
files
already
does
that
make
it
less
morbid
or
you
really
morbid
i
had
to
to
teach
her
class
relax
will
i
was
making
with
the
funny
does
that
say
'restoration'
it's
one
of
her
spells
i
think
ms
calendar
wasn't
a
practicing
witch
but
she
did
dabble
willow
oh
boy
oh
boy
oh
boy
nici
mort
nici
deal
fiintei
te
invoc
spirit
al
trecerii
reda
trupului
ce
separa
omul
de
animal
neither
dead
nor
of
the
living
i
invoke
you
spirit
of
the
passing
return
to
the
body
what
distinguishes
man
from
the
beast
asa
sa
fie
so
it
shall
be
utrespur
aceastui
restore
this
one
it
hurts
yes
good
it
will
hurt
more
where
am
i
you
don't
remember
everything
you've
done
for
a
hundred
years
in
a
moment
you
will
the
face
of
everyone
you
killed
our
daughter's
face
they
will
haunt
you
and
you
will
know
what
true
suffering
is
killed
i
i
don't
no
no
no
no
what
are
you
saying
the
curse
this
is
it
looks
like
ms
calendar
was
trying
to
replicate
the
original
curse
to
restore
angel's
soul
again
she
said
it
couldn't
be
done
well
she
tried
anyway
and
it
looks
like
it
might
have
worked
so
he
killed
her
before
she
could
tell
anyone
about
it
what
a
prince
huh
this
is
good
right
i
mean
we
can
curse
him
again
um
well
this
um
certainly
points
the
way
but
the
ritual
itself
requires
a
greater
knowledge
of
the
black
arts
than
i
i
i
can
claim
well
i've
been
going
through
her
files
and
and
researching
the
black
arts
for
fun
or
educational
fun
and
i
may
be
able
to
work
this
wwillow
channeling
such
potent
magicks
through
yourself
it
could
open
a
door
that
you
may
not
be
able
to
close
i
don't
want
you
putting
yourself
in
any
danger
will
and
i
don't
want
danger
big
'no'
to
danger
but
i
may
be
the
best
person
to
do
this
hi
for
those
of
you
who
have
just
tuned
in
everyone
here
is
a
crazy
person
so
this
spell
might
restore
angel's
humanity
well
here's
an
interesting
angle
who
cares
i
care
is
that
right
let's
not
lose
our
perspective
here
xander
i'm
perspective
guy
angel's
a
killer
xander
it's
not
that
simple
what
all
is
forgiven
i
can't
believe
you
people
xander
has
a
point
you
know
just
for
once
i
wish
you'd
support
me
and
i
realize
right
now
that
you
were
and
i'm
embarrassed
so
i'm
gonna
get
back
to
the
point
which
is
that
angel
needs
to
die
curing
angel
seems
to
have
been
jenny's
last
wish
yeah
well
jenny's
dead
don't
you
ever
speak
of
her
in
that
tone
again
can't
you
hear
what
i'm
saying
stop
it
stop
it
what
do
you
wanna
do
ii
don't
know
what
happened
to
angel
wasn't
his
fault
yeah
but
what
happened
to
ms
calendar
is
you
can
paint
this
any
way
you
want
but
the
way
i
see
it
is
that
you
wanna
forget
all
about
ms
calendar's
murder
so
you
can
get
your
boyfriend
back
hello
i'll
have
one
of
these
to
go
dru
save
me
some
well
i'll
do
a
couple
of
sweeps
and
then
i'll
stop
by
yeah
xander
was
pretty
much
being
a
willow
where
did
you
learn
that
word
my
god
you
kiss
your
mother
with
that
mouth
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
what
i
wanna
do
i'll
i'll
see
you
in
a
little
while
okay
you
know
polite
people
call
before
they
jump
out
of
the
bushes
and
attack
you
just
wanted
to
test
your
reflexes
how
about
testing
my
facepunching
'cause
i
think
you'll
find
it's
improved
i
was
on
my
way
to
your
house
saw
you
walking
couldn't
help
meself
which
begs
the
question
and
don't
think
i'm
not
glad
to
see
you
but
why
are
you
here
oh
wait
no
let
me
guess
your
watcher
informed
you
dat
a
very
dark
power
is
about
to
rise
in
sunnydale
dat's
about
it
great
so
you
have
any
idea
what
this
dark
power
is
it's
a
big
rock
i
can't
wait
to
tell
my
friends
they
don't
have
a
rock
this
big
spike
boy
you
never
did
learn
your
history
let's
have
a
lesson
then
acathla
the
demon
came
forth
to
swallow
the
world
he
was
killed
by
a
virtuous
knight
who
pierced
the
demon's
heart
before
he
could
draw
a
breath
to
perform
the
act
acathla
turned
to
stone
as
demons
sometimes
do
and
was
buried
he
fills
my
head
i
can't
hear
anything
else
let
me
guess
someone
pulls
out
the
sword
someone
worthy
mm
the
demon
wakes
up
and
wackiness
ensues
he
will
swallow
the
world
and
every
creature
living
on
this
planet
will
go
to
hell
my
friends
we're
about
to
make
history
end
i've
been
on
the
phone
to
the
museum
the
artifact
in
question
is
missing
and
the
curator
has
been
murdered
vampires
and
you're
sure
this
was
the
tomb
of
alfalfa
acathla
and
yes
the
information
provided
by
kendra's
watcher
seems
conclusive
okay
somebody
explain
the
whole
'he
will
suck
the
world
into
hell'
thing
because
that's
the
part
i'm
not
loving
well
the
uh
the
demon
universe
exists
in
a
dimension
separate
from
our
own
with
one
breath
acathla
will
create
a
vortex
aa
kind
of
um
whirlpool
that
will
pull
everything
on
earth
into
that
dimension
where
any
nondemon
life
will
suffer
horrible
and
eternal
torment
so
that
would
be
the
literal
kind
of
'sucked
into
hell'
neat
willow
i
think
you
should
try
the
curse
i
tend
to
side
with
your
friend
xander
on
this
one
angel
should
be
eliminated
oh
i'll
fight
him
i'll
kill
him
if
i
have
to
but
if
i
don't
get
there
in
time
or
if
i
lose
then
willow
might
be
our
only
hope
i
don't
wanna
be
our
only
hope
uh
i
crumble
under
pressure
let's
have
another
hope
we
have
blessed
by
the
knight
who
first
slew
the
demon
if
all
else
fails
this
might
stop
it
i
tink
ooh
may
i
may
i
thank
you
well
llet's
uh
hope
all
else
doesn't
fail
um
how
close
are
you
to
ffiguring
out
the
ritual
of
the
curse
i
need
about
a
day
and
an
'orb
of
thesulah'
whatever
that
is
spirit
vault
for
rituals
of
the
undead
i've
got
one
ii've
been
using
it
as
a
paperweight
this
means
i
can't
help
you
study
for
tomorrow's
final
ah
i'll
wing
it
of
course
if
we
go
to
hell
by
then
i
won't
have
to
take
'em
or
maybe
i'll
be
taking
them
forever
angel
has
a
ritual
of
his

quod
perditum
est
invenietur
what
is
lost
return
'not
dead
nor
not
of
the
living
spirits
of
the
interregnum
i
call'
cut
to
the
graveyard
buffy
ducks
a
punch
from
angelus
and
comes
up
behind
him
he
spins
around
to
block
her
return
swing
he
blocks
another
jab
from
her
and
punches
her
in
the
face
he
follows
up
with
a
left
hook
and
buffy
loses
her
balance
and
nearly
falls
down
angelus
grabs
her
by
the
back
of
her
coat
and
throws
her
over
onto
the
grounds
she
rolls
away
and
onto
her
back
and
looks
up
at
him
come
on
willow
'let
him
know
the
pain
of
humanity
gods
reach
your
wizened
hands
to
me
give
me
the
sword'
suddenly
a
vampire
comes
out
from
the
stacks
and
attacks
xander
from
behind
the
main
doors
fly
open
and
kendra
spins
around
to
defend
as
two
more
vampires
walk
in
giles
points
to
the
steps
and
yells
at
the
girls
as
a
fourth
vampire
appears
from
the
stacks
get
out
go
go
jeez
is
it
me
or
is
your
heart

finish
this
you

my
eyes

in
me
nightnight
let's
get
what
we
came
for
dears
bottom
line
is
even
if
you
see
'em
coming
you're
not
ready
for
the
big
moments
no
one
asks
for
their
life
to
change
not
really
but
it
does
so
what
are
we
helpless
puppets
no
the
big
moments
are
gonna
come
you
can't
help
that
it's
what
you
do
afterwards
that
counts
that's
when
you
find
out
who
you
are
freeze
you'll
see
what
i
mean
