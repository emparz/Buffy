it's
a
looplike
the
mummy
hand
i'm
doomed
to
replace
these
windows
for
all
eternity
you
know
maybe
we
should
just
board
these
up
until
things
are
less
hellmouthy
nothingand
nothing
cliff
notes
to
nothing
nothing
abridged
yeah
my
search
isn't
turning
anything
up
either
are
you
sure
this
thing
called
itself
the
first
pretty
sure
it
claimed
to
be
the
original
evil
the
one
that
came
before
anything
else
please
how
many
times
have
i
heard
that
line
in
my
demon
days
i'm
so
rotten
they
don't
even
have
a
word
for
it
i'm
bad
baddy
bad
bad
bad
does
it
make
you
horny
or
terrified
whatever
it
wasn't
a
line
when
i
came
up
against
this
thing
i
felt
it
it
was
ancient
and
enormous
it
nearly
got
angel
to
kill
himself
and
if
we
don't
rescue
spike
soon
god
only
knows
what
the
first'll
get
him
to
do
i
wish
sleeping
ugly
would
come
to
he's
been
out
all
night
yes
he
was
just
starting
to
squeal
when
the
spooky
swat
attacked
said
the
first
was
held
up
at
the
seal
ofdanzar
something
hmm
maybe
he's
just
faking
so
he
doesn't
have
to
answer
any
more
questions
hm
or
maybe
he's
in
a
fugue
state
dawn
what
he'll
come
to
when
he
comes
to
keep
reading
if
we're
gonna
rescue
spike
we
need
to
figure
out
how
to
fight
this
thing
anya
gets
to
hit
him
hey

firstbank
of
delaware

real
or—

the
first

so
tired

not
making
sense
maybe
you
should
get
some
sleep
no

can't
win
against
this
thing
not
if
you
don't
rest
stop
stop
being
like
this
it's
a
lie
i
don't
want
to
scare
you
but
i
want
you
to
take
care
you
need
to
wake
up
what
you're
dreaming
buff
wake
up
hm
did
you
see
it
there's
nothing
to
see
you
were
just
doing
a
little
dream
talking
that's
all
oh
you
ok
what'd
you
see
nothing
it
was
nothing
go
on
give
it
a
kick
then
you
always
liked
that
didn't
you
kick
a
dolly
when
he's
down
that
was
always
your
style
has
buckets
of
energy
poor
dear
he's
been
laying
in
wait
for
his
moment
since
before
the
bug
walked
there
there
pet
soon
as
the
moon
comes
you'll
have
your
carnage
little
girls
tear
so
easily
like
pink
paper
'til
then
we'll
have
our
way
with
this
one
got
it
coming
he
does
that
was
something
maybe
if
you
threw
hot
water
on
him
good
thinking
whoa
hey
hi
nothing
what
oh
um
i
thought
you
were
gonna
ask
us
what
we
were
doing
no
was
going
to
ask—
oh
look
who's
awake
silly
andrew
you
drooled
all
over
yourself
i'm—i
was
about
to
be
dead
you
saved
me
for
the
time
being
but
if
you
don't
tell
us
what
we
need
to
know
then
i'm
gonna
offer
you
to
the
first
on
a
platter
and
let
him
chop
you
into
tiny
pieces
the
first
what
the
name
of
the
evil
thing
that
pretended
to
be
warren
to
get
you
to
kill
jonathan
oh
not
very
ominous
sounding
no
iit
is
if
you
understand
the
context
no
an
evil
name
should
be
like
lex
or
voldemort
or—
hey
i
was
intimidating
here
oh
sorry
um
go
ahead
forget
it
where's
the
seal
it's
around
this
corner
i
think
you
better
be
right
this
time
i
told
you—i'm
not
sure
maybe
you
should
get
sure
i'm
sick
of
all
the
runaround
with
you—
whoa
check
out
the
goatheady
badness
what's
it
do
i
don't
know
something
not
good
it
didn't
work
'cause
there
wasn't
enough
blood
ok
there's
blood
on
this
lots
looks
like
the
first
made
another
sacrifice
or
a
music
video
the
seal
could've
been
activated
i
bet
that's
what
the
first
needed
spike
for
that
wasn't
there
before
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
thanks
for
clearing
that
up
'cause
otherwise
we
might've
thought
you
were
up
to
no
good
here
at
the
satanic
manhole
cover
you
killed
your
best
friend
he's
in
a
place
of
joy
and
peace
he
told
me
no
nobody
told
you
you
got
tricked
by
a
fake
ghost
boys
can
we
save
the
encounter
session
we
need
to
cover
this
thing
up
whatever
it
does
we
can't
leave
it
exposed
like
this
man
this
place
gives
me
the
creeps
it's
like
in
wonder
woman
issue
297299—
catacombs—yeah
with
the
skeletons
that
was
cool
move
it
this
way
so
what
next
we
found
the
seal
but
no
spike
i
don't
know
the
first
was
camped
underground
last
time
i
found
him
but—
buffy
hey
hey

that
you
were
um—
sick

was
oh
vomiting
and
oozing
from
various
places
and—
yeah
i
remember

amazing
the
doctor
gave
her
some
cream
pills
and
a
cream

all
better

direction
and
principal
wood

away
in
the
other
direction
buffy
turns
to
look
at
him
quizzically
then
turns
back
then
principal
wood
turns
to
look
at
buffy
twirling
his
shovel
as
he
walks
away
how's
it
going
dawn's
trying
to
find
out
anything
she
can
about
the
seal
of
danzalthar
will's
about
to
do
a
locator
spell
see
if
we
can
find
the
first
why
don't
you
go
get
some
rest
you
haven't
slept
for
like
two
days
we'll
call
you
if
we
find
anything
nah
ii
couldn't
sleep
too
much
going
on
it'll
be
ok
buff
we've
faced
this
kind
of
stuff
before
you
didn't
see
the
first
i
did
i
felt
it
it
was
like—
will
you
only
make
me
stronger
will
it's
still
in
me
i
feel
it
no
it's
not
it's
gone
you're
ok
i
don't
want
to
hurt
anybody
please
buffy
don't
let
it
make
me
oh
god
we
won't
i
promise
ok
i
promise
we
won't
use
magic
to
fight
this
thing
until
we
know
what
we're
doing
i
can't
i
can't
i'm
sorry
at
least
let
me
come
with
you
i'm
going
alone
you
said
yourself
you
don't
know
how
to
fight
the
first
or
even
where
it
is
it's
out
there
it's
hurting
my
friends
i'll
find
it
buffy
giles
nice
place
bit
of
a
mess
this
is
a
slayer
sorry
to
barge
in
we
have
a
slight
apocalypse
they're
all
slayers
potential
slayers
waiting
for
one
to
be
called
there
were
many
more
like
them
all
over
the
world
but
um
now
there's
just
a
handful
and
they're
all
on
their
way
to
sunnydale
the
others
were
murdered
in
cold
blood
as
well
as
their
watchers
we
always
feared
that
this
day
would
come
when
there'd
be
an
attack
against
not
just
an
individual
slayer
but
against
the
whole
line
it's
started
the
first
that's
what
it
wants
yes
to
erase
all
the
slayers
in
training
and
their
watchers
along
with
their
methods
and
then
faith
and
then
me
and
with
all
the
potentials
gone
and
no
way
of
making
another
it's
the
end
no
more
slayer
ever
but
we
haven't
found
any
information
on
the
first
no
documentation—
that's
because
it
predates
any
written
history
and
it
rarely
shows
its
true
face
the
only
record
i
know
was
in
the
council
library
what
about
the
council
what
do
they
say
about
this
gone
what
obliterated
they
were
in
session
and
uh
there
was
an
explosion
that
means
all
the
council's
records
areare
destroyed
annabelle
that's
what's
left
the
mystic
secrets
of
the
watchers
and
whatever
i
could
find
on
the
first
when
i
learned
what
was
happening
ii
um
i
stole
them
and
you
blew
the
council
up
see
this
is
what
happens
when
you're
all
stuffy
and
repressed
you
overreact
not—i
didn't
must've
been
an
agent
of
the
first
after
my
little
burglary
session
the
knowledge
contained
in
these
files
had
to
be
protected
and
there
wasn't
time
forfor
bureaucracy
or
debate
the
council
knows
no
other
way
and
it
cost
them
their
lives
go
on
can
we
gag
him
but
what
do
these
records
say
about
the
first
uh
very
little
it
can
change
form
uh
it
only
appears
in
the
guise
of
someone
who's
passed
away
our
ghosts
also
it's
not
corporeal
it
can't
touch
or
fight
on
it's
own
it
only
works
through
those
it
manipulates
and
its
followers
the
bringers
those
freaks
in
the
black
robes
yeah
with
the
hoodies
and
the
crazy
alphabet
eyes
i
never
saw
'em
i
just
heard—
shh
molly
mr
giles
doesn't
need
us
prattling
on
the
first
is
unlike
anything
we've
faced
before
i
mean
there's
evil
and
then
there's
the
thing
that
created
evil
the
source
and
that's
what
this
thing
claims
to
be
that's
what
it
is
it
has
eternities
to
act
endless
resources
how
to
defeat
it—ii—
honestly
i
don't
know
but
we
have
to
find
a
way
if
the
slayer
line
is
eliminated
then
the
hell
mouth
has
no
guardian
the
balance
is
destroyed
i'm
afraid
it
falls
to
you
buffy
sorry
i
mean
we'll
do
what
we
can
but
you're
the
only
one
who
has
the
strength
to
protect
these
girls—and
the
world—against
what's
coming
but
no
pressure
that's
it
that's
the
plan
i
don't
see
how
one
person
even
a
slayer
could
protect
us
i
saw
what
those
bringer
guys
can
do
they
tore
apart
my
watcher
of
course
we'll
use
all
our
resources—
and
if
this
thing
is
the
root
of
all
evil
isn't
the
hell
mouth
it's
number
one
vacation
spot
i
mean
don't
you
think
we
should
be
hiding
our
asses
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
kennedy
no
she's
not
wrong
we
need
more
muscle
that's
why
we
need
to
find
spike
yeah
he'll
help
you
know
if
he's
not
crazy
or
off
killing
people
or
dead
or
you
know
all
of
the
above
that's
why
our
kind
make
such
good
dollies
hard
to
kill
tried
to
enlighten
little
buffy
didn't
you
spilled
spilled
spilled
our
secrets
like
seed
but
you
forgot
i
say
what
you
tell
and
what
you
know
i
say
when
this
is
over
and
i'm
not
done
with
you
yet
not
nearly
this
place
you
originally
saw
the
first—you
say
it
was
in
a
christmas
tree
lot
under
it
there
was
a
hidden
cavern
just
happened
to
be
under
a
tree
lot
the
bringers
were
doing
some
kind
of
ritual
giles
this
is
bad
isn't
it
a
new
kind
of
bad
just
in
time
for
christmas
you
know
i
didn't
even
realize
it
was
december
maybe
when
we
get
home
we
should
decorate
the
rubble
think
you'll
ever
show
up
for
a
real
visit
the
kind
where
the
world
isn't
about
to
end
if
we
survive
this
i
promise
good
'cause
i
miss
you
i
miss
you
too
so
how
long
have
you
followed
buffy
i
don't
follow
her
she's
my
best
friend
huh
she
seems
like
a
good
leader
her
hair
is
shiny
does
she
make
you
stab
things
ok
so
annabelle
can
sleep
down
here

talk
her
ear

she
want
to
eat

new
well
annabelle
and
molly
are
starved
and
i
totally
burnt
the
mac
and
cheese
oh
um
i'll
put
hot
sauce
on
it
tell
'em
it's
an
american
thing
say
it's
blackened
actually
it's
not
blackened
so
much
as
ruined
or
we
can
order
pizza
as
long
as
it's
plain
i'm
veggie
cracked
you
mean
just
because
you'll
eat
any
kind
of
trash—
brill
biscuits
you
don't
mind
do
you
i
got
a
case
of
the
nerves
after
mr
giles
lecture
knock
yourself
out
i
feel
a
cookie
problem
coming
on
myself
so
the
entrance
to
the
cave
was
above
ground
here
yeah
i'm
pretty
sure
it
was
around
here
somewhere
well
we'll
just
keep—
aah
found
it
good
lord
are
you
all
right
peachy
except
my
knees
bend
backwards
now
ok
giles
stay
up
there
i'm
gonna
check
it
out
right
the
others
just
yet
it'll
give
us
a
chance
to—
sorry
about
the
british
invasion
we've
been
up
for
hours
4
pm
london
time
are
you
all
right
you
look
oh
yeah
i'm
ok
i
just
got
into
a
fight
is
all
you
want
to
tell
me
with
what
yes
buffy
but
don't
you
think
we
should
uh
discuss
this
privately
you
mean
not
in
front
of
the
next
generation
no
time
to
coddle
them
giles
welcome
to
the
war
room
guys
uh
what
you
fought
was
a
vampire
but
it
was
um
something
more
than
that
it
was
a
turokhan
as
neanderthals
are
to
human
beings
the
turokhan
are
to
vampires
primordial
ferociously
powerful
killing
machines
as
singleminded
as
animals
they
are
the
vampires
that
vampires
fear
an
ancient
and
entirely
different
race
and
until
this
morning
i
thought
they
were
a
myth
so
the
first
shows
up
and
now
this
you
think
it's
a
coincidence
i
think
it's
more
likely
that
the
turokhan
is
here
as
an
agent
of
the
first
um
did
you
slay
it
no
it's
still
out
there
somewhere
what's
it
want
all
of
us
dead
but
for
now
it
looks
like
sunlight
is
keeping
this
ubervamp
away
so
until
sunset
i
suggest
you
get
some
rest
a
few
hours
sleep
will
do
a
world
of
difference
no
sleep
today
can't
oh
come
on
you're
exhausted
ah
it
comes
with
the
gig
somehow
i
don't
think
taking
on
prehistoric
evil
comes
with
nap
time
sorry
potential
guys
i
know
you
came
a
long
way
and
you
wanna
get
into
it
but
the
best
thing
you
can
do
right
now
is
just
sit
tight
wait
it
out
i'm
gonna
go
to
work
see
what
i
can
find
out
i'll
be
back
before
sunset
how
do
you
plan
to
research
something
as
illdefined
as
the
first
i
have
the
best
plan
ever
yeah
well
i
already
rechecked
the
basement
wait
you
know
hold
on
i'm
gonna
try
something
maybe
the
first
isn't
ready
for
modern
technology
displaying
results

ok
i
gotta
narrow
this
down
i'll
call
you
back
yeah
manifestations
of
evil
in
the
movies
you're
searching
for
evil
movies
uh
i
know
it's
not
the
alltime
most
kosher
use
of
my
office
hours
um
but
you
know
looking
at
some
down
time
and
what
can
i
say
i
just
love
those
evil
evil
movies
like
exorcist
you
know
blair
witch
hmm
as
opposed
to
rob
schneider's
oeuvre
different
kind
of
evil
yeah
buffy
you
know
i'm
not
that
big
a
fan
of
scary
movies
even
the
hokie
ones
sometimes
they
go
to
a
place
that
i
think
kids
could
stand
to
avoid
well
it's
not
for
the
kids
yeah
yeah
i'm
only
saying
that
once
you
see
true
evil
it
can
have
some
serious
after
burn
and
then
you
can't
unsee
what
you
saw
ever
that's
just
one
opinion
i
better
get
back
to
work
what
kind
of
movies
do
you
like
oh
me
mysteries
i
love
finding
out
what's
underneath
it
all
at
the
very
end
think
of
it
as
a
game
a
fun
funny
game
without
all
the
rules
or
any
of
the
bothersome
winning
part
but
still
there
are
sides
you
have
to
choose
a
side

the
dark
side
but
just
to
pick
up
a
few
things
aand
now
i'm
back
i've
learned
i'm
good
again
and
when
were
you
good
before
ok
technically
never
touché
but
i'm
like
vader
in
the
last
5
minutes
of
jedi
with
redemptive
powers
minus
a
redemptive
struggle
of
epic
redemption
which
chronicles
these
ropes
itch
how're
we
doing
on
time
sunset
should
be
any
minute
now
done
everything
we
can
and
don't
worry
everyone
here
understands
that
you're
calling
the
shots
i
just
hope
i'm
calling
the
right
ones
you
have
all
my
faith
and
they're
depending
on
you
giles
that's
not
exactly
what
i
needed
to
hear
right
now
guys
annabelle
split
buffy
oh
god
almighty
do
you
know
why
you're
alive
never
figured
you
for
existential
thought
luv
i
mean
you
hated
paris
you're
alive
for
one
reason
and
one
reason
only
because
i
wish
it
do
you
know
why
i
wish
it
because
i'm
not
done
with
you
give
it
up
whatever
you
are
whatever
you
get
away
with
i'm
out
you
can't
pull
this
puppet's
strings
anymore
and
what
makes
you
think
you
have
a
choice
what
makes
you
think
you
will
ever
be
any
good
at
all
in
this
world
she
does
because
she
believes
in
me
we
could
make
plans
as
we
always
do
but
the
truth
is
buffy
was
our
plan
there
is
no
back
up
giles
she
looks
bad
she
does
i'm
afraid
there
may
be
internal
bleeding
what
does
that
mean
will
she—
die
i
don't
think
so
i
don't
know
what
do
we
do
if
she
can't
fight
if
she
can't
beat
this
thing
we're
back
at
square
one
which
square
would
that
be
exactly
i'm
not
sure
the
first
predates
everything
we've
ever
known
or
can
know
it's
everywhere
it's
pure
i
don't
know
if
we
can
fight
it
you're
right
we
don't
know
how
to
fight
it
we
don't
know
when
it'll
come
we
can't
run
can't
hide
can't
pretend
it's
not
the
end
'cause
it
is
something's
always
been
there
to
try
and
destroy
the
world
we've
beaten
them
back
but
we're
not
dealing
with
them
anymore
we're
dealing
with
the
reason
they
exist
evil
the
strongest
the
first
buffy
i—ii
know
you're
tired
i'm
beyond
tired
i'm
beyond
scared
i'm
standing
on
the
mouth
of
hell
and
it
is
gonna
swallow
me
whole
and
it'll
choke
on
me
we're
not
ready
they're
not
ready
they
think
we're
gonna
wait
for
the
end
to
come
like
we
always
do
i'm
done
waiting
they
want
an
apocalypse
oh
we'll
give
'em
one
anyone
else
who
wants
to
run
do
it
now
'cause
we
just
became
an
army
we
just
declared
war
from
now
on
we
won't
just
face
our
worst
fears
we
will
seek
them
out
we
will
find
them
and
cut
out
their
hearts
one
by
one
until
the
first
shows
itself
for
what
it
really
is
and
i'll
kill
it
myself
there
is
only
one
thing
on
this
earth
more
powerful
than
evil
and
that's
us
any
questions
