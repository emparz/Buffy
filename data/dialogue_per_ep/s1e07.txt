long
time

he
spent
the
night
in
your
room
in
your
bed

the
oldest
trick
in
the
book
what
saving
my
life
getting
slashed
in
the
ribs
duh
i
mean
guys'll
do
anything
to
impress
a
girl
ii
once
drank
an
entire
gallon
of
gatorade
without
taking
a
breath
it
was
pretty
impressive
although
later
there
was
an
ick
factor
can
we
steer
this
riveting
conversation
back
to
the
events
that
happened
earlier
in
the
evening
you
left
the
bronze
and
were
set
upon
by
three
unusually
virile
vampires
did
they
look
like
this
yeah
what's
with
the
uniforms
it
seems
you
encountered
the
three
warrior
vampires
very
proud
and
very
strong
how
is
it
you
always
know
this
stuff
you
always
know
what's
going
on
i
never
know
what's
going
on
well
you
weren't
here
from
midnight
until
six
researching
it
no
i
was
sleeping
uh
oobviously
you're
hurting
the
master
very
much
he
he
wouldn't
send
the
the
three
for
just
anyone
we
must
step
up
our
training
with
weapons
buffy
you
should
stay
at
my
house
until
these
samurai
guys
are
history
what
ahahah
don't
worry
about
angel
willow
can
run
to
your
house
and
tell
him
to
get
out
of
town
fast
angel
and
buffy
are
are
not
in
any
immediate
jeopardy
we
failed
in
our
duty
and
now
our
lives
belong
to
you
pay
attention
child
you
are
the
anointed
and
there
is
much
you
must
learn
with
power
comes
responsibility
true
they
did
fail
but
also
true
we
who
walk
at
night
share
a
common
bond
the
taking
of
a
life
i'm
not
talking
about
humans
of
course
is
a
serious
matter
so
you
would
spare
them
hmm
i
am
weary
and
their
deaths
will
bring
me
little
joy
of
course
sometimes
a
little
is
enough
cool
crossbow
huh
check
out
these
babies
hmm
goodbye
stakes
hello
flying
fatality
what
can
i
shoot
um
nothing
the
crossbow
comes
later
you
must
first
become
proficient
with
the
basic
tools
of
combat
and
let's
begin
with
the
quarterstaff
which
incidentally
will
uh
require
countless
hours
of
vigorous
training
i
speak
from
experience
giles
20th
century
i'm
not
gonna
be
fighting
friar
tuck
you
never
know
with
whom
or
what
you'll
be
fighting
and
these
traditions
have
been
handed
down
through
the
ages
now
you
show
me
good
steady
progress
with
the
quarterstaff
and
in
due
course
we'll
discuss
the
crossbow
put
on
your
pads
i'm
not
gonna
need
pads
to
fight
you
well
we'll
see
about
that
en
garde
good
let's
move
on
to
the
crossbow
angel
hey
brought
you
some
dinner
it's
a
little
plateless
sorry
so
what'd
you
do
all
day
uh
i
read
a
little
and
just
thought
about
a
lot
of
things
buffy
i
my
diary
you
read
my
diary
that
is
not
okay
a
diary
is
like
a
person's
most
private
place
i
you
don't
even
know
what
i
was
writing
about
'hunk'
can
mean
a
lot
of
things
bad
things
and
and
when
it
says
that
your
eyes
are
'penetrating'
i
meant
to
write
'bulging'
buffy
and
'a'
doesn't
even
stand
for
'angel'
for
that
matter
it
stands
for
'achmed'
a
charming
foreign
exchange
student
so
that
whole
fantasy
part
has
nothing
to
even
do
with
you
at
all
your
mother
moved
your
diary
when
she
came
in
to
straighten
up
i
watched
from
the
closet
i
didn't
read
it
i
swear
oh
oh
i
did
a
lot
of
thinking
today
i
really
can't
be
around
you
because
when
i
am
hey
no
big
water
over
the
bridge
under
the
bridge
when
i
am
all
i
can
ever
think
about
is
how
badly
i
want
to
kiss
you
over
the
dam
kiss
me
i'm
older
than
you
and
this
can't
ever
i
better
go
hhow
much
older
i
should
go
you
said
what
what
is
it
what's
wrong
buffy
what
happened
uh
nothing
i
saw
a
shadow
angel's
a
vampire
i
can't
believe
this
is
happening
one
minute
we
were
kissing
and
the
next
minute
can
a
vampire
ever
be
a
good
person
couldn't
it
happen
a
vampire
isn't
a
person
at
all
it
may
have
the
movements
the
the
memories
even
the
personality
of
the
person
that
it
took
over
but
iit's
still
a
demon
at
the
core
there
is
no
halfway
so
that'd
be
a
no
huh
well
then
what
was
he
doing
why
was
he
good
to
me
was
it
all
some
part
of
the
master's
plan
it
doesn't
make
sense
alright
uh
you
have
a
problem
and
it's
not
a
small
one
let's
take
a
breath
and
look
at
this
calmly
and
objectively
angel's
a
vampire
you're
a
slayer
i
think
it's
obvious
what
you
have
to
do
uh
it
is
a
slayer's
duty
ii
know
you
have
feelings
for
this
guy
but
it's
not
like
you're
in
love
with
him
right
you're
in
love
with
a
vampire
what
are
you
outta
your
mind
what
not
vampire
how
could
you
love
an
umpire
everyone
hates
'em
where
did
you
get
that
dress
this
is
a
oneof
akind
todd
oldham
do
you
know
how
much
this
dress
cost
is
this
a
knockoff
this
is
a
knockoff
isn't
it
some
cheesy
knockoff
this
is
exactly
what
happens
when
you
sign
these
free
trade
agreements
you
think
we
have
problems
who's
here
a
friend
hi
it's
been
a
while
a
lifetime
or
two
but
who's
counting
what's
with
the
catholic
schoolgirl
look
last
time
i
saw
you
it
was
kimonos
and
last
time
i
saw
you
it
wasn't
high
school
girls
don't
cha
like
remember
budapest
turn
of
the
century
you
were
such
a
bad
boy
during
that
earthquake
you
did
some
damage
yourself
is
there
anything
better
than
a
natural
disaster
the
panic
the
people
lost
in
the
streets
it's
like
picking
fruit
off
the
vine
nice
you're
living
above
ground
like
one
of
them
you
and
your
new
friend
are
attacking
us
like
one
of
them
but
guess
what
precious
you're
not
one
of
them
are
you
no
but
i'm
not
exactly
one
of
you
either
is
that
what
you
tell
yourself
these
days
you're
not
exactly
living
off
quiche
you
and
i
both
know
what
you
hunger
for
what
you
need
hey
it's
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
it's
who
we
are
it's
what
makes
eternal
life
worth
living
mm
you
can
only
suppress
your
real
nature
for
so
long
you
can
feel
it
brewing
inside
of
you
i
hope
i'm
around
when
it
explodes
maybe
you
don't
wanna
be
i'm
not
afraid
of
you
i
bet
she
is
though
or
maybe
i'm
underestimating
her
talk
to
her
tell
her
about
the
curse
maybe
she'll
come
around
and
if
she
still
doesn't
trust
you
you
know
where
i'll
be
here's
something
at
last
can
you
please
warn
us
before
you
do
that
there's
nothing
about
angel
in
the
texts
but
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
it's
been
ages
since
i've
read
the
diaries
of
any
of
the
watchers
before
me
that
musta
been
so
embarrassing
when
you
thought
he
had
read
your
diary
but
then
it
turned
out
he
hadn't
but
then
he
felt
the
same
way
i'm
listening
there's
mention
some
two
hundred
years
ago
in
ireland
of
of
angelus
the
one
with
the
angelic
face
they
got
that
right
i'm
not
saying
anything
i
have
nothing
to
say
does
this
uh
angel
have
um
a
tattoo
behind
his
right
shoulder
yeah
it's
a
it's
a
bird
or
something
now
i'm
sayin'
something
you
saw
him
naked
so
angel's
been
around
for
a
while
not
long
for
a
vampire
uh
two
hundred
and
forty
years
or
so
huh
two
hundred
and
forty
well
he
said
he
was
older
angelus
leaves
ireland
uh
wreaks
havoc
in
in
europe
for
uh
several
decades
and
then
um
about
eighty
years
ago
the
most
curious
thing
happens
he
he
comes
to
uh
to
america
um
shuns
other
vampires
and
and
lives
alone
there's
there's
no
no
record
of
him
hunting
here
so
he
is
a
good
vampire
i
mean
on
a
scale
of
one
to
ten
ten
being
someone
who's
killing
and
maiming
every
night
and
one
being
someone
who's
not
i
say
that
there's
no
record
but
uh
vampires
hunt
and
kill
it's
it's
what
they
do
fish
gotta
swim
birds
gotta
fly
he
could've
fed
on
me
he
didn't
question
a
hundred
years
or
so
before
he
came
to
our
shores
what
was
he
like
then
uh
like
all
of
them
uh
a
vicious
violent
animal
don't
think
i'm
not
grateful
you
letting
me
kill
the
three
how
can
my
children
learn
if
i
do
everything
for
them
but
you've
gotta
let
me
take
care
of
the
slayer
oh
you're
giving
me
orders
now
okay
then
we'll
just
do
nothing
while
she
takes
us
out
one
by
one
do
i
sense
a
plan
darla
share
angel
kills
her
and
comes
back
to
the
fold
angel
he
was
the
most
vicious
creature
i
ever
met
i
miss
him
so
do
i
why
would
he
kill
her
if
he
feels
for
her
to
keep
her
from
killing
him
hmm
you
see
how
we
all
work
together
for
the
common
good
that's
how
a
family
is
supposed
to
function
okay
so
let's
review
reconstruction
began
when
buffy
huh
oh
um
reconstruction
uh
reconstruction
began
after
the
construction
which
was
shoddy
so
they
had
to
reconstruct
after
the
destruction
of
the
civil
war
right
civil
war
during
which
angel
was
already
like
a
hundred
and
change
are
we
gonna
talk
about
boys
or
are
we
gonna
help
you
pass
history
sometimes
i
have
this
fantasy
that
xander's
just
gonna
grab
me
and
kiss
me
right
on
the
lips
you
want
xander
you've
gotta
speak
up
girl
no
no
no
no
no
speaking
up
that
way
leads
to
madness
and
sweaty
palms
okay
so
here's
something
i
gotta
know
when
angel

oh
um
no

this

mr

oh
the

uh
ii
just

to
pay
my
respects
wish
you
a
speedy
recovery
boy
the
teachers
really
do
care
in
this
town
get
some
rest
now
she's
gonna
be
okay
they
they
gave
her
some
iron
her
uh
blood
count
was
a
a
little
a
little
low
it
presents
itself
like
mild
anemia
uh
you
you
were
uh
lucky
you
got
to
her
as
soon
as
you
did
lucky
stupid
buff
it's
not
your
fault
no
i
invited
him
into
my
home
even
after
i
knew
who
he
was
what
he
was
and
i
didn't
do
anything
about
it
'cause
i
had
feelings
for
him
because
i
cared
about
him
if
you
care
about
somebody
you
care
about
them
you
can't
change
that
by
killing
them
maybe
not
but
i
think
it's
a
start
uh
we'll
keep
an
eye
on
your
mom
buffy
you
can't
stop
me
the
three
found
me
near
the
bronze
and
so
did
he
he
lives
nearby
this
is
no
ordinary
vampire
if
there
is
such
a
thing
now
he
knows
you
he
he's
faced
the
three
i
think
this
is
gonna
take
more
than
a
simple
stake
so
do
i
she's
out
hunting
you
right
now
she
wants
to
kill
you
leave
me
alone
what
did
you
think
did
you
think
she
would
understand
that
she
would
look
at
your
face
your
true
face
and
give
you
a
kiss
for
a
hundred
years
you've
not
had
a
moment's
peace
because
you
will
not
accept
who
you
are
that's
all
you
have
to
do
accept
it
don't
let
her
hunt
you
down
don't
whimper
and
mewl
like
a
mangy
human
kill
feed
live
alright

do
you
want
i
want
it
finished
that's
good
you're
hurting
me
that's
good
too
she
talks
about
you
all
the
time
it's
important
to
have
teachers
who
make
an
impression
she
makes
quite
an
impression
herself
ii
know
she's
having
trouble
with
history
iis
it
too
difficult
for
her
or
is
she
not
applying
herself
she
lives
very
much
in
the
now
um
and
uh
history
of
course
is
is
very
much
about
the
uh
the
then
bbbut
there's
no
reason
she's
studying
with
willow
she's
studying
with
darla
ii
mean

is
trying
darla
iii

your
house

the
friend

mentioned
earlier
poor
thing

must've
frightened

to
death

make
sure
she's
alright

do
it
that
school
is
amazing
we

a
problem
i

you're
there
and
i
know
what
you
are
do
you
i'm
just
an
animal
right
you're
not
an
animal
animals
i
like
let's
get
it
done
c'mon
don't
go
soft
on
me
now
little
wide
why
why
didn't
you
just
attack
me
when
you
had
the
chance
was
it
a
joke
to
make
me
feel
for
you
and
then
i've
killed
a
lot
of
vampires
i've
never
hated
one
before
feels
good
doesn't
it
feels
simple
i
invited
you
into
my
home
and
then
you
attacked
my
family
why
not
i
killed
mine
i
killed
their
friends
and
their
friend's
children
for
a
hundred
years
i
offered
ugly
death
to
everyone
i
met
and
i
did
it
with
a
song
in
my
heart
what
changed
fed
on
a
girl
about
your
age
beautiful
dumb
as
a
post
but
a
favorite
among
her
clan
her
clan
romany
gypsies
the
elders
conjured
the
perfect
punishment
for
me
they
restored
my
soul
what
they
were
all
out
of
boils
and
blinding
torment
when
you
become
a
vampire
the
demon
takes
your
body
but
it
doesn't
get
your
soul
that's
gone
no
conscience
no
remorse
it's
an
easy
way
to
live
you
have
no
idea
what
it's
like
to
have
done
the
things
i've
done
and
to
care
i
haven't
fed
on
a
living
human
being
since
that
day
so
you
started
with
my
mom
i
didn't
bite
her
then
why
didn't
you
say
something
but
i
wanted
to
i
can
walk
like
a
man
but
i'm
not
one
i
wanted
to
kill
you
tonight
go
ahead
not
as
easy
as
it
looks
sure
it
is
we're
near
the
bronze
what
now
keep
looking
for
her
i
have
a
question
what
if
we
find
her
and
she's
fighting
angel
and
some
of
his
friends
what
the
heck
are
we
gonna
do
about
it
do
you
know
what
the
saddest
thing
in
the
world
is
bad
hair
on
top
of
that
outfit
to
love
someone
who
used
to
love
you
you
guys
were
involved
for
several
generations
well
you
been
around
since
columbus
you
are
bound
to
pile
up
a
few
ex's
you're
older
than
him
right
just
between
us
girls
you
are
looking
a
little
worn
around
the
eyes
i
made
him
there
was
a
time
when
we
shared
everything
wasn't
there
angelus
you
had
a
chance
to
come
home
to
rule
with
me
in
the
master's
court
for
a
thousand
years
but
you
threw
that
away
because
of
her
you
love
someone
who
hates
us
you're
sick
and
you'll
always
be
sick
and
you'll
always
remember
what
it
was
like
to
watch
her
die
you
don't
think
i
came
alone
do
you
i
know
i
didn't
hmm
scary
scarier
oh
don't
worry
bullets
can't
kill
vampires
can
hurt
them
like
hell
but
did
you
just
hear
so
many
body
parts
so
few
bullets
let's
begin
with
the
kneecaps
no
fun
dancing
without
them
close
but
no
heart
we
need
to
distract
her
fast
buffy
it
wasn't
angel
who
attacked
your
mom
it
was
darla
c'mon
buffy
take
it
like
a
man
angel
forget
her
how
dare
you
she
was
my
favorite
for
four
hundred
years
she
was
weak
you
don't
need
her
i'll
bring
you
the
slayer
but
to
lose
her
to
angel
he
was
to
have
sat
at
my
right
hand
come
the
day
and
now
they're
all
against
you
but
soon
you
shall
rise
and
when
you
do
we
kill
them
all
ah
the
postfumigation
party
okay
so
what's
the
difference
between
this
and
the
pre
fumigation
party
much
hardier
cockroaches
so
no
word
from
angel
nah
it's
weird
though
in
his
way
i
feel
like
he's
still
watching
me
well
in
a
way
he
sort
of
is
in
the
way
of
that
he's
right
over
there
i
don't
need
to
watch
because
i'm
not
threatened
just
gonna
look
this
way
did
they
know
what
they
wanted
the
times
they
kissed
me
and
your
hands
i
held
in
mine
i
just
wanted
to
see
if
you
were
okay
and
your
mother
we're
both
good
you
if
i
can
go
a
little
while
without
getting
shot
or
stabbed
i'll
be
alright
look
this
can't
ever
be
anything
i
know
for
one
thing
you're
like
two
hundred
and
twentyfour
years
older
than
i
am
i
just
gotta
i
gotta
walk
away
from
this
i
know
me
too
one
of
us
has
to
go
here
i
know
your
eyes
that
always
make
me
shiver
now
they
are
closed
they
just
sometimes
twitch
a
little
what's
going
on
nothin'
well
as
long
as
they're
not
kissing
and
your
body
i
could
hold
for
an
hour
it
sent
me
to
heaven
with
its
heat
and
power
you
okay
it's
just
painful
i
know
see
you
around
i'll
remember
you
you
will
be
there
in
my
heart
i'll
remember
you
and
that
is
all
that
i
can
do
but
i'll
remember
