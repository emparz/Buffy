now
they

little
kids

you
see

so
tiny
i
saw
who
could
do
something
like
this
i
just
i'm
so
sorry
that
you
had
to
see
this
but
i
promise
everything
is
gonna
be
okay
how
because
i'm
gonna
find
whatever
did
it
i
guess
it's
just
you
can't
you
can't
make
it
right
i
know
i'm
sorry
but
i'll
take
care
of
everything
i
promise
just
try
and
calm
down
don't
tell
me
to
calm
down
iii
only
meant
they
were
kids
giles
little
kids
you
don't
know
what
it
was
like
to
see
them
there
my
mom
can't
even
talk
i'm
sorry
i
i
just
want
to
help
i
know
do
we
know
how
uh
it
wasn't
a
vampire
no
there
were
no
marks
wait
ii
mean
there
there
was
a
mark
um
aa
symbol
oh
uh
12th
century
papal
encyclical
write
on
this
iit
was
on
their
hands
the
cops
are
keeping
it
quiet
but
i
got
a
good
look
at
it
there
find
me
the
thing
that
uses
this
symbol
and
point
me
at
it
hmm
hmm
what
giles
speak
what
oh
sorry
um
no
it
i
just
wonder
if
we're
looking
for
a
thing
the
use
of
a
symbol
ooon
a
victim
like
this
suggests
a
a
ritual
murder
and
a
cult
sacrifice
by
a
group
a
group
of
human
beings
someone
with
a
soul
did
this
yes
i'm
afraid
so
okay
then
while
you're
looking
for
the
meaning
of
that
symbol
thingy
could
you
also
find
a
loophole
in
that
'slayers
don't
kill
people'
rule
buffy
this
is
a
dreadful
crime
i
know
and
you
have
every
right
to
be
upset
but
ii
wonder
if
you're
not
letting
yourself
get
a
shade
uh
more
personal
because
of
your
mother's
involvement
oh
it's
completely
personal
giles
find
me
the
people
that
did
this
please

god
your
mom

actually
take
the
time
to
do
that
with
you
that
really
wasn't
the
point
of
the
story
was
it
no
the
point
is
she's
completely
wigging
who's
wigging
um
everyone
you
know
'cause
of
what
happened
oh
it's
so
awful
ii
had
bad
dreams
about
it
all
night
hi
mrs
summers
oh
hi
everybody
hi
hi
mrs
summers
buffy
have
you
talked
to
mr
giles
yet
about
who
could
have
done
this
yeah
he
uh
he
thinks
it
might
be
something
ritual
a
cult
uh
he's
still
looking
in
the
meantime
we're
gonna
add
to
my
patrol
and
and
y'know
keep
an
eye
out
a
cult
like
witches
sorry
phlegm
too
much
dairy
oh
iii
know
you
kids
think
that
stuff's
cool
buffy
told
me
you
dabble
right
absolutely
that's
me
i'm
a
dabbler
but
anybody
who
could
do
this
isn't
cool
anybody
who
could
do
this
has
to
be
a
monster
it's
you
know
what
uh
would
you
guys
excuse
us
for
a
little
bit
uh
nnice
to
see
you
what
a
burn
i
mean
buff's
mom
was
just
starting
to
accept
the
whole
slayer
thing
and
now
she's
gonna
be
doublefreaked
makes
me
grateful
that
my
mom's
not
interested
in
my
extracurricular
activities
or
my
curricular
activities
are
your
friends
gonna
help
with
the
investigation
too
mom
i
really
think
maybe
this
isn't
the
best
place
to
talk
about
this
are
you
embarrassed
to
be
hanging
out
with
your
mother
i
didn't
hug
you
no
it's
just
this
hall
is
about
school
and
you're
about
home
mix
them
my
world
dissolves
it's
just
i
keep
thinking
about
who
could
have
done
such
a
thing
i
have
to
help
well
giles
can
always
use
help
in
the
library
i
called
everybody
i
know
in
town
i
told
them
about
the
dead
children
they're
all
just
as
upset
as
i
am
you
called
everybody
that
you
know
and
they
called
all
their
friends
and
guess
what
we're
setting
up
a
vigil
for
tonight
for
city
hall
the
mayor
is
even
gonna
be
there
now
we
are
gonna
get
some
action
uhhuh
that's
great
uh
but
you
know
what
a
lot
of
times
when
we're
working
on
stuff
like
this
we
like
to
keep
the
number
of
people
that
know
about
it
kind
of
small
oh
right
well
ii'm
sure
there
won't
be
all
that
many
people
this
is
great
maybe
we
could
all
go
patrolling
together
later
at
least
your
mom's
making
an
effort
my
mom's
probably
standing
right
in
front
of
me

a
while

while

a
rumor
going
around
mr
giles
rrumor
about
us
aaabout
what
about
witches
people
calling
themselves
witches
are
responsible
for
this
brutal
crime
indeed
how
strange
yes
strange
well
actually
not
that
strange
i
recently
coauthored
a
paper
about
the
rise
of
mysticism
among
adolescents
and
i
was
shocked
at
the
statistical
oh
oh
aare
we
starting
hello
everybody
he'll
do
something
about
this
you'll
see
um
i
wanna
thank
you
all
for
coming
in
the
aftermath
of
such
a
tragic
crime
seeing
you
all
here
proves
what
a
caring
community
sunnydale
is
now
sure
we've
had
our
share
of
misfortunes
but
we're
a
good
town
with
good
people
and
i
know
that
none
of
us
will
rest
easy
until
this
horrible
murder
is
solved
with
that
in
mind
i
make
these
words
my
pledge
to
you
'never
again'
now
i
ask
you
to
give
your
attention
to
the
woman
who
brought
us
all
here
tonight
joyce
summers
thank
you
mr
mayor
you're
dead
wrong
this
is
not
a
good
town
how
many
of
us
have
have
lost
someone
who
who
just
disappeared
or
or
got
skinned
or
suffered
neck
rupture
and
how
many
of
us
have
been
too
afraid
to
speak
out
ii
was
supposed
to
lead
us
in
a
moment
of
silence
but
silence
is
this
town's
disease
for
too
long
wewe've
been
plagued
by
unnatural
evils
this
isn't
our
town
anymore
i
say
it's
time
for
the
grownups
to
take
sunnydale
back
i
say
we
start
by
finding
the
people
who
did
this
and
making
them
pay
hear
hear
watch
it
oh
sorry
did
i
make
you
smudge
your
eyeliner
you
gonna
put
a
spell
on
me
hey
what
is
your
problem
everyone
knows
he's
into
that
voodoo
witchcraft

heard
about
those
kids
people
like
him
gotta
learn
a
lesson
and
what
about
people
like
me
get
in
my
face
and
you'll
find
out
no
problem
here
we're
walking
you
guys
okay
yeah
we're
fine
thanks
buffy
you'll
be
one
busy
little
slayer
babysitting
them
i
doubt
they'll
have
any
more
trouble
i
doubt
your
doubt
everyone

that
witches
killed
those
kids
and
amy
is
a
witch
and
michael
is
whatever
the
boy
of
witch
is
plus
being
the
poster
child
for
yuck
corde

expect
badness
'cause
that's
what
you
get
when
you
hang
with
freaks
and
losers
believe
me
i
know
that
was
a
pointed
comment
about
me
hanging
with
you
guys
yeah
i
got
that
one
besides
witches
didn't
do
it
actually
i
think
they
may
have
my
research
keeps
bringing
me
back
to
european
wiccan
covens
you
found
the
meaning
of
the
symbol
i'm
pretty
sure
yes
there's
a
a
piece
of
information
i
need
that's
in
a
book
that
willow
borrowed
can
you
find
it
buffy
hi
hey
is
willow
around
how
can
i
convince
you
people
that
it's
over
you
assume

here
she's
here
that
i
somehow
mysteriously
know
where
she
is
those
her
books
yeah
she's
in
the
bathroom

the
fact
that
i
know
that
doesn't
change
that
i
have
a
genuine
complaint
here

proven
guilty

are
guilty

got
illicit
smoochies

pay
the
price

i'm
talking
about
the
future
guilt

mess
up
again
like
oz
i
see
how
he
is
around
me
you
know
that
steely
gaze
that
pointed
silence
'cause
he's
usually
such
a
chatterbox
no
but
it's
different
now

more
a
verbal
nonverbal
he
speaks
volumes
with
his
eyes

locker's
next
buffy

the

it
to
make
a
protection
spell
for
you
for
your
birthday
with
michael

amy
only
now
it's
broken
because
you

to
believe
me
ms
rosenberg
my
office
giles
they're
confiscating
my
books
giles
we
need
those
books
believe
me
i
tried
to
tell
that
to
the
nice
man
with
the
big
gun
no
there's
something
about
the
symbol
that
we're
missing
i
don't
know
ordinarily
i
would
say
let's
widen
our
research
using
what
aa
dictionary
and
'my
friend
flicka'
this
is
intolerable
snyder's
interfered
before
but
i
i
won't
take
this
from
that
twisted
little
homunculus
i
love
the
smell
of
desperate
librarian
in
the
morning
you
get
out
and
take
your
marauders
with
you
oh
my
so
fierce
i
suppose
i
should
hear
you
out
just
how
is
um
'blood
rites
and
sacrifices'
appropriate
material
for
a
public
school
library
chess
club
branching
out
this
is
not
over
oh
i
should
say
it's
just
beginning
fight
it
if
you
want
answer
to
moo
did
that
sentence
just
make
some
sense
that
i'm
not
in
on
'mothers
opposed
to
the
occult'
a
powerful
new
group
and
who
came
up
with
that
lame
name
that
would
be
the
founder
i
believe
you
call
her
'mom'
oh
sit
down
honey
principal
snyder
talk
to
you
yes
he's
quite
concerned
mom
i
know
what
this
looks
like
and
i
can
totally
oh
you
don't
have
to
explain
honey
this
isn't
exactly
a
surprise
why
not
oh
well
identification
with
mythical
icons
is
perfectly
typical
of
your
age
group
it's
a
a
classic
adolescent
response
to
the
pressures
of
incipient
adulthood
oh
is
that
what
it
is
of
course
i
wish
you
could've
identified
with
something
a
little
less
icky
but
developmentally
speaking
mom
i'm
not
an
age
group
i'm
me
willow
group
oh
honey
i
understand
no
you
don't
mom
this
may
be
hard
for
you
to
accept
but
i
can
do
stuff
nothing
bad
or
dangerous
but
i
can
do
spells
you
think
you
can
and
that's
what
concerns
me
the
delusions
mom
how
would
you
know
what
i
can
do
i
mean
the
last
time
we
had
a
conversation
over
three
minutes
it
was
about
the
patriarchal
bias
of
the
mr
rogers
show
well
with
king
friday
lording
it
over
all
the
lesser
puppets
mom
you're
not
paying
attention
and
this
is
your
way
of
trying
to
get
it
now
i
have
consulted
with
some
of
my
colleagues
and
they
agree
that
this
is
a
cry
for
discipline
you're
grounded
grounded
this
is
the
first
time
ever
i've
done
something
you
don't
like

i'm
grounded

your
specialness

a
witch

wants
to
weed
out
the
offensive
material
everything
else
will
be
returned
to
mr
giles
soon
if
we're
gonna
solve
this
we
need
those
books
now
sweetie
those
books
have
no
place
in
a
public
school
library
especially
now
any
student
can
waltz
in
there
and
get
all
sorts
of
ideas
do
you
understand
how
that
terrifies
me
mom
i
hate
that
these
people
scared
you
so
much
and
ii
know
that
you're
just
trying
to
help
but
you
have
to
let
me
handle
this
it's
what
i
do
but
is
it
really
i
mean
you
patrol
you
slay
evil
pops
up
you
undo
it
aaand
that's
great
but
is
sunnydale
getting
any
better
i
don't
think
that
you
run
out
of
it's
not
your
fault
you
don't
have
a
plan
you
just
react
to
things
iiit's
bound
to
be
kind
of
fruitless
okay
maybe
i
don't
have
a
plan
lord
knows
i
don't
have
lapel
buttons
buffy
and
maybe
next
time
that
the
world
is
getting
sucked
into
hell
i
won't
be
able
to
stop
it
because
the
antihellsucking
book
isn't
on
the
approved
reading
list
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
mean
to
put
down
yeah
well
you
did
it
doesn't
matter
i
have
to
go
i
have
to
go
on
one
of
my
pointless
patrols
and
react
to
some
vampires
if
that's
alright
with
moo
and
nice
acronym
mom
just
trying
to
make
things
better
you
are
there's
bad
people
out
there
and
we
can't
sleep
not
until
you
hurt
them
the
way
they
hurt
us
hey
hi
how
are
you
i'm
alright
i
think
i'm
better
than
you
right
now
i
heard
about
this
people
are
talking
people
are
even
talking
to
me
it's
strange
people
die
in
sunnydale
all
the
time
i've
never
seen
anything
like
this
they
were
children
innocent
it
makes
a
difference
and
mr
sanderson
from
the
bank
had
it
coming
my
mom
she's
wrong
is
she
is
sunnydale
any
better
than
when
i
first
came
here
okay
so
i
battle
evil
but
i
don't
really
win
the
bad
keeps
coming
back
and
getting
stronger
like
that
kid
in
the
story
the
boy
that
stuck
his
finger
in
the
duck
dike
it's
another
word
for
dam
oh
okay
that
story
makes
a
lot
more
sense
now
buffy
you
know
i'm
still
figuring
things
out
there's
a
lot
i
don't
understand
but
i
do
know
it's
important
to
keep
fighting
i
learned
that
from
you
but
we
never
we
never
win
not
completely
we
never
will
that's
not
why
we
fight
we
do
it
'cause
there's
things
worth
fighting
for
those
kids
their
parents
their
parents
look
i
know
it's
not
much
no
no
it's
a
lot
session
interrupted
who
said
you
could
interrupt
you
stupid
useless
fad
no
i
said
fad
and
i'll
say
it
again
at
that
point
i
will
become
frightened
take
heart
we
found
your
books
you
can
put
the
heart
back
we
can't
get
them
they're
locked
up
in
city
hall
'frisky
watcher's
chat
room'
why
giles
oh
buffy
oz
and
i
found
out
what
do
we
know
about
these
kids
what
facts
details
well
they
were
uh
found
in
the
park
no
where
did
they
go
to
school
who
were
their
parents
what
are
their
names
we
know
everything
about
their
deaths
but
we
don't
even
know
their
names
well
sure
we
do
um
it's
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
that
never
came
up
ever
and
if
no
one
knows
who
they
are
where
did
these
pictures
come
from
i
just
assumed
someone
had
the
details
i
never
really
well
that
is
strange
we
need
to
get
some
information
yeah
well
somebody
else
do
it
this
thing's
locked
me
out
well
if
you
wouldn't
yell
at
it
i
can
look
'round
but
willow
would
really
know
the
sites
we
need
that's
great
she
can't
even
come
to
the
phone
the
wrath
of
moo
well
we
don't
need
a
phone
alright
we're
linked
if
anybody's
id'd
the
kids
she'll
pull
it
up
and
feed
it
here
oh
'two
children
found
dead
mysterious
mark'
no
no
these
children
were
found
near
omaha
in
1949
yeah
they
ain't
ours
keep
going
wait
those
are
the
same
kids
fifty
years
ago
'1899
utah
two
children
rural
community
torn
apart
by
suspicion'
giles
a
hundred
years
ago
how
is
this
possible
there's
no
mention
of
who
they
were
they've
never
been
seen
alive
just
dead
a
lot
ah
there
were
more
articles
every
fifty
years
all
the
same
from
as
far
back
as
1649
can
i
see
that
written
by
a
cleric
from
a
village
near
the
black
forest
he
so
they
have
names
that's
new
willow
i
thought
i
made
myself
clear
you're
not
minding
me
mom
i
see
what
you're
doing
you're
challenging
me
but
i
will
not
have
you
communicating
with
your
cybercoven
or
what
have
you
coven
what
happened
to
me
being
delusional
and
acting
out
well
that
was
before
i
talked
in
depth
with
ms
summers
and
her
associates
it
seems
i've
been
rather
closeminded
so
you
believe
me
i
believe
you
dear
now
all
i
can
do
is
let
you
go
with
love
let
me
go
what
does
that
mean
mom
uh
wait
wait
a
minute
uh
uh
there
is
a
fringe
theory
held
by
a
few
folklorists
that
some
regional
stories
have
actual
um
very
literal
antecedents
and
in
some
language
that's
english
fairy
tales
are
real
hans
and
gre
hansel
and
gretel
wait
hansel
and
gretel
breadcrumbs
ovens
gingerbread
house
of
course
well
it
makes
sense
now
yeah
it's
all
falling
into
place
of
course
that
place
is
nowhere
near
this
place
some
demons
thrive
by
fostering
hatred
and
and
uh
persecution
amongst
the
mortal
animals
not
by
not
by
destroying
men
but
by
watching
men
destroy
each
other
now
they
feed
us
our
darkest
fear
and
turn
peaceful
communities
into
vigilantes
hansel
and
gretel
run
home
to
tell
everyone
about
the
mean
old
witch
and
then
she
and
probably
dozens
of
others
are
persecuted
by
a
righteous
mob
it's
happened
all
throughout
history
it
happened
in
salem
not
surprisingly
whoa
whoa
whoa
i'm
still
spinning
on
this
whole
fairy
tales
are
real
thing
