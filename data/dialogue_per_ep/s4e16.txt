it's
good
you
called
we've
been
looking
for
this
girl
since
she
broke
out
of
the
hospital
what's
going
to
happen
to
her
well
get
her
checked
out
if
she's
in
stable
condition
she
goes
to
jail
pending
trial
i
just
hope
she
gets
some
kind
of
help
the
first
thing
is
to
keep
her
from
hurting
anybody
else
well
you
guys
will
be
safe
now
we
may
have
a
couple
of
questions
in
the
morning
oh
uh
of
course
thank
you
both
i'm
glad
we
finally
got
the
kid
she's
not
a
kid
i
just
mean
that
she's
very
strong
yeah
this
faith
chick
definitely
dangerous
she
truly
is
why
do
you
think
she's
like
that
you
know
she's
a
nut
job
heh
i
just
don't
understand
what
could
drive
a
person
to
that
kind
of
behavior
well
how
do
you
know
she
got
drove
i
mean
maybe
she
likes
being
that
way
i'll
never
believe
that
i
think
she's
horribly
unhappy
well
could
be
things
are
looking
up
i
mean
a
little
stint
in
the
pokey
show
her
the
error
of
her
ways
i'm
sure
there's
some
big
old
bertha
just
waiting
to
shower
her
ripe
little
self
with
affection
buffy
i'm
sorry
mom
it's
just
ugh
when
i
think
about
how
she
might
have
hurt
you

just
ugh
i
can't
stand
it
sorry

i'm
just
uh
sore
from
the
fight

missed
you

in

busy
little
beaver

raving
psychotic
count
on

about

i
already

that
ass
i
feel
a
high
five
coming
on
where
is
she
on
her
way
to
the
big
house
cops
took
her
off
my
hands
about
an
hour
ago
poetic
justice
how's
that
well
she
did
all
those
crimes
and
now
she's
being
arrested
i
guess
that's
just
regular
justice
it's
cool
anyway
unless
i'm
mistaken
faith
is
no
longer
in
police
custody
what
are
you
talking
about
watcher's
council
they
uh
sent
a
retrieval
team
to
capture
faith
well
yeah
i
mean
'cause
it
worked
so
well
when
wesley
tried
it
this
is
a
special
operations
unit
they
uh
handle
the
council's
trickier
jobs
smuggling
interrogation
wetworks
what's
wetworks
scubatype
stuff
i
thought
it
was
murder
well
yeah
but
there
could
be
underwater
murder
with
snorkels
so
they're
taking
her
to
england
it'll
be
a
long
long
time
before
she
returns
heh
heh
heh
ahhh
hah
hah
hah
hah
ohhh
i'm
sorry
it's
justi'm
happy
faith
is
evil
yeah
i
hope
they
throw
the
book
at
her
i'm
not
sure
there
is
a
a
book
for
this
they
could
throw
other
things
i
forgot
how
much
you
don't
like
faith
after
what
she's
done
to
you
oh
i
wish
those
council
guys
would
let
me
have
an
hour
alone
in
the
room
with
her
if
i
was
larger
and
had
grenades
i
bet
i
know
what
faith
would
say
to
that
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
everything's
fine
oh
um
yes
well
i'm
glad
you
called
us
all
here
because
that
information
could
never
be
conveyed
by
telephone
what's
up
well
i
just
thought
it
was
uh
best
to
convene
in
case
there
were
any
loose
ends
i'd
never
let
her
hurt
you
or
things
that
we
might
have
forgotten
i
know
but
if
you're
uh
keen
to
go
then
please
by
all
means
go
we
kind
of
have
a
romantic
evening
planned
we
were
gonna
light
a
bunch
of
candles
and
have
sex
near
them
well
we
certainly
don't
want
to
cut
into
that
seven
minutes
hey
i
believe
that's
my
hey
hey
lighten
up
we're
out
of
danger
everything's
good
we
still
have
adam
to
take
care
of
yeah
adam
what's
up
with
him
i
wish
we
knew
well
don't
worry
about
it
i'll
patrol
tonight
as
long
as
it
takes
you
guys
have
your
fun
i'll
be
out
there
doing
my
job
whoop
oh
you
and
you
what
are
you
keeping
tabs
on
me
you're
gonna
give
me
a
hard
time
now
um
do
i
usually
give
you
a
hard
time
very
funny
well
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
me
drinking
unless
you're
here
to
protect
innocent
beers
you're
a
vampire
was
and
as
soon
as
i
get
this
chip
out
of
my
head
i'll
be
a
vampire
again
but
until
then
i'm
just
as
helpless
as
a
kitten
up
a
tree
so
why
don't
you
sod
off
ok
oh
fine
throw
it
in
my
face
spike's
not
a
threat
anymore
i'll
turn
my
back
he
can't
hurt
me
spike
spike
william
the
bloody
with
a
chip
in
his
head
i
kind
of
love
this
town
you
know
why
i
really
hate
you
summers
'cause
i'm
a
stuckup
tightass
with
no
sense
of
fun
well
yeah
that
covers
a
lot
of
it
cause
i
could
do
anything
i
want
and
instead
i
choose
to
pout
and
whine
and
feel
the
burden
of
slayerness
i
mean
i
could
be
rich
i
could
be
famous
i
could
have
anything
anyone
even
you
spike
i
could
ride
you
at
a
gallop
until
your
legs
buckled
and
your
eyes
rolled
up
i've
got
muscles
you've
never
even
dreamed
of
i
could
squeeze
you
until
you
popped
like
warm
champagne
and
you'd
beg
me
to
hurt
you
just
a
little
bit
more
and
you
know
why
i
don't
because
it's
wrong
humh
humh
i
get
this
chip
out
you
and
me
are
gonna
have
a
confrontation
count
on
it
it
was
too
crowded
we
gotta
hold
out
for
a
few
hours
pick
up
a
straggler
some
drunk
can't
be
calling
attention
to
ourselves
i've
been
thinking
about
vampires
this
is
my
place
you're
place
yes
the
sewers
you
hide
from
them
crawl
about
in
their
filth
scavenging
like
rats
what
do
you
fear
kill
this
guy
already
you
fear
the
cross
the
sun
fire
and
oh
yes
i
believe
decapitation
is
a
problem
as
well
you
can
have
the
place
i
mean
we
don't
have
to
stay
here
anymore
you
fear
death
being
immortal
you
fear
it
more
than
those
to
whom
it
comes
naturally
vampires
are
a
paradox
ok
we're
a
paradox
that's
cool
demon
in
a
human
body
you
walk
in
both
worlds
and
belong
to
neither
i
can
relate

when

we
always
put
our
affairs
in
order
first
in
case
of
accident
collins
sorry
smithy
she's
starting
to
bother
me
getting
her
across
the
border
is
gonna
be
a
lot
more
trouble
than
it's
worth
if
the
council
can
even
get
us
passage
i'll
call
them
it's
time
for
a
contingency
plan
hi
baby
i'm
sorry
you're
feeling
all
blechy
but
we'll
get
together
with
buffy
another
time
sometime
soon
i
think
you'll
really
like
her
she's
not
your
friend
i
may
have
overestimated
the
you
liking
her
factor
no
no
i
mean
i
don't
i
don't
think
she'sher
you
lost
me
well
um
a
person's
energy
has
a
flow
a
unity
buffy's
was
was
fragmented
itit
grated
like
something
forced
in
where
it
doesn't
belong
plus
she
was
um
she
was
kind
of
mean
so
you
think
buffy's
not
herself
like
she's
been
possessed
or
something
i'm
not
sure
you
didn't
sense
a
hyena
energy
at
all
did
you
because
hyena
possession
is
justunpleasant
do
you
have
anything
of
hers
of
buffy's
uhhhh
oh
this
ring
ii
think
there's
a
way
we
can
hmm
the
passage
to
the
nether
realm
therethere's
a
ritual
if
you
can
find
buffy
there
you
should
be
able
to
see
if
it'll
help
her
what
well
the
nether
realm
exists
beyond
the
physical
world
accessing
it
is
iitit's
kind
of
like
astral
projection
it's
very
intense
i'd
have
to
be
your
anchor
keep
you
on
this
plane
i
trust
you
itit's
not
like
anything
that
we've
ever
i
trust
you
you
miss
me
i
did
actually
everything's
ok
everything's
great
what
about
faith
faith
has
a
won
a
fabulous
trip
to
england
and
i
got
the
consolation
prize
which
is
you
so
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
faith
showing
up
though
i
have
to
admit
i
was
kind
of
curious
to
meet
her
or
i
was
until
about
30
seconds
ago
oh
you
wouldn't
have
liked
faith
she's
not
proper
and
joyless
like
a
girl
should
be
she
has
a
tendency
to
give
in
to
her
animal
instincts
door's
open
so
so
my
fantasies
don't
tend
to
include
a
bunch
of
marines
staring
in
at
me
oh
maybe
they
could
learn
something
you're
hurt
ahh
um
not
that
bad
actually
i
guess
the
uh
drugs
the
professor
gave
me
really
did
make
me
stronger
i'm
healing
pretty
quick
maybe
we
should
take
you
for
a
test
drive
i
wouldn't
say
no
sohow
do
you
want
me
how
do
i
yeah
what
do
you
wanna
do
with
this
body
what
nasty
little
desire
have
you
been
itching
to
try
out
am
i
a
bad
girl
do
you
wanna
hurt
me
what

we
playing

god
willow
wait

draconian
katra
spell
she
understands
it

did
you
tara
tara
this

time
hi
tara's
a
really
powerful
witch
not
really
no
really
she
knew
right
away
that
you
weren't
you
so
we
connected
with
the
nether
realms
to
find
out
what
happened
and
we
conjured
this
what
is
it's
a
katra
or
the
homeconjured
version
itit
should
switch
you
back
if
you
can
get
a
hold
of
faith
oh

get
it
hello

where
faith
is
oh
yes

xander
apparently
there's
a
report
on
the
television
and
barricaded
themselves
in
the
church
with
at
least
20
parishioners
one
of
the
few
who
escaped
described
the
three
men
as
frighteningly
disfigured
almost
inhuman
so
far
one
escapee
has
since
died
of
severe
neck
wounds
there
is
no
report
on
the
condition
of
the
parishioners
still
trapped
inside
but
their
assailants
have
vowed
to
kill
all
of
them
if
police
attempt
to
storm
the
church
it's
hard
to
believe
i've
been
avoiding
this
place
for
so
many
years
and
it's
nothing
it's
nice
it's
got
the
pretty
windows
the
pillars

us
this
address
well

just
have
to

killing
off
his
people
see
if
he
shows
up
what'd
he
say
he
said
i
should
defer
command
to
you
then
you
hold
your
men
until
the
reserves
arrive

a
military
situation
