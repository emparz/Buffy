thanks
for
the
relocation
i
perform
better
without
an
audience
you
were
thinking
what
a
little
helpless
coed
before
bed
you
know
very
well
you
eat
this
late
you're
gonna
get
heartburn
get
it
heartburn

that's
it
that's
all
i
get
one
lameass
vamp
with
no
appreciation
for
my
painstakingly
thoughtout
puns
i
don't
think
the
forces
of
darkness
are
even
trying
i
mean
you
could
make
a
little
effort
here
you
know
give
me
something
to
work
with
watch
your
mouth
little
girl
you
should
know
better
than
to
tempt
the
fates
that
way
'cause
the
big
bad
is
back
and
this
time
it's
urrgh
aaaahhh
the
bronze
is
more
fun
this
year
isn't
it
'cause
of
the
gloating
factor
alone
you
know
we're
all
about
college
now
we've
got
heady
discourse
yeah
curfewfree
nights
of
mom
and
popless
hootenanny
coed
dating
prospects
who
find
townies
sexy
and
dangerous
what
i
can
dream
right
so
if
college
is
so
great
what
are
we
doing
here
and
why
is
it
more
fun
because
the
bronze
is
nice
and
familiar
it's
like
a
big
comfy
blanky
i
was
under
the
impression
that
i
was
your
big
comfy
blanky
aw
you're
mymy
person
blanky
this
is
my
place
blanky
you
know
with
all
the
shock
of
the
new
it's
nice
to
have
one
place
that
you
can
come
back
to
where
everything's
predictable
hello
giles
trouble
oh
no
buffy
don't
get
up
no
nothing
like
that
no
i
just
you
know
i
thought
i'd
drop
by
uh
latte
anyone
on
me
so
much
for
your
predictable
blanky
theory
will
sorry

i've
been
to
a
gig

look
that
way
i'mi'mi'm
down
with
the
new
music
and
i
have
the
albums

seen
giles'
collection

was
an
animal
in
his
day
thank

faking

not
just
a
little
morning
morning
bad
dream
i
guess
but
the
waking
up
part
makes
up
for
it
it's
always
so
busy
in
there
not
always
a
few
things
shut
my
brain
up
completely
anything
i
can
help
you
with
i
gotta
get
to
class
right
now
but
tonight
for
sure

extreme
jerry
garcia

before
the
full
moon
oh

a
thing

i
wanted

have
orientation
on

totally
silly
but

'em
how
it's
done

you
sure
you
can
lock
yourself
up
it's
only
this
one
month
after

they
meet
on
different
nights
i'll
be
fine
ok
as
long

3
nights
ms

agreed
you

tight
last

dirty
to
me

cool
i
love
to
listen

i
know
you
told
me
there's
a
couple
good
ones
the
johnson
mil
the
number
one
is
redbone
number
one

song
i

elvis
what
a
guy
you
a
big
elvis
fan
the
biggest
well
i
mean
after
dingoes
of
course
we're
actually
talking
amps
but
it's
easy
to
get
confused
the
names
they
give
'em
oh
ha
ha
you
know
i
gotta
bail
um
i'll
call
you
later
i
should
go
too
good
shirt
check
out
the
rapid
exits
was
it
me
me
i
don't
speak
musicianese
how
come
you
didn't
tell
me
i
look
like
a
crazy
birthday
cake
in
this
shirt
i
thought
that
was
the
point
he
thinks
she's
sexy
he
gets
this
blushy
thing
going
on
behind
his
ears
that's
for
me
only
it
doesn't
mean
anything
so
oz
checks
out
another
girl
he
loves
you
i
know
ii
know
and
i
don't
wanna
be
the
kind
of
girl
who
freaks
every
time
my
boyfriend
notices
somebody
else
i
mean
i
have
wrong
feelings
about
other
guys
sometimes
but
i
feel
guilty
and
i
flog
and
punish
exactly
i'm
sure
oz
is
flogging
and
punishing
himself
this
is
sounding
wrong
before
i
even
finish
look
i
promise
you
in
a
couple
of
days
it's
gonna
be
like
veruca
who
you
think
absolutely
oz
just
isn't
the
type
to
stray
not
tonight
anyways
he'll
be
locked
in
a
cage
that
was
um
some
night
so
it
appears
right
you
don't
remember
it's
like
that
at
first
but
then
little
bits
and
pieces
will
start
coming
back
to
you
so
you're
a
werewolf
groupie
nobody
else
gets
it
done
for
me
what
kidding
you
know
what
i
am
you've
known
since
the
first
time
you
saw
me

do
you
want
to
do

big
way

a
cute
little
bell
in
it
god
somebody's
domesticated
the
hell
out
of
you
it's
my
choice
i
don't
wanna
hurt
anybody
maybe
or
maybe
you
just
don't
wanna
admit
what
happened
to
you
maybe
you
just
wanna
pretend
like
you're
a
regular
guy
well
i
am
i'm
only
a
wolf
3
nights
a
month
or
you're
a

check
the
paper

did
any
damage
last
night

powerful
inside
me

the
time

feel
sorry

it's
like
to
be
as
alive
as
we
are
as
free

to
kill
people
i
won't

buffy
excellent
uh

i

a
very
interesting
mousaka
last

if
you're
hungry

on
the
tea
and
the
moose
thank
you
you
come
on
business
i
hope
yes
lucky
for
you
people
may
be
in
danger
i
only
meant
uh
that
i'm
at
the
ready
here's
the
deal
one
of
my
professors
said
that
she
was
almost
attacked
by
two
wild
dogs
last
night
under
the
light
of
a
nearly
full
moon
werewolves
two
of
them
could
be
well
i've
not
seen
anything
about
the
attacks
in
the
newspapers
or
on
the
news
have
you
spoken
with
oz
my
next
stop
right
get
right
on
it
and
i'll
see
what
i
can
find
out
and
you
report
back
to
me
asap
promise
hey
will
mom
let
you
in
she
seemed
cranky
yeah
we're
having
a
little
landlordtenant
dispute
so
i'm
withholding
rent
an
effective
and
might
i
add
thrifty
tactic
how
come
she
won't
let
me
put
a
lock
on
my
door
i
suspect
she's
afraid
i'll
start
having
the
sex
yeah
parents
usually
wait
till
you're
out
of
the
house
or
under
it
or
under
it
to
start
worrying
about
stuff
like
that
it's
mostly
too
late
so
i
know
why
i'm
sitting
in
a
dank
sunless
little
room
but
why
are
you
well
things
with
oz
are
weird
and
i
talked
to
buffy
about
it
but
i
think
we're
in
guyville
here
i
need
a
translator
from
the
y
side
of
things
well
last
time
i
checked
i
had
the
creds
hit
me
what
does
it
mean
when
a
girl
wants
to
you
know
if
you're
doin'
it
i
think
you
should
be
able
to
say
it
make
love
wild
monkey
love
or
tender
sarah
mclachlan
love
any
kind
but
what
if
the
girl
wants
to
and
the
guy
doesn't
that's
a
bad
sign
right
could
be
or
the
girl
caught
the
guy
in
one
of
the
7
annual
minutes
he's
legitimately
too
preoccupied
to
do
it
well
say
the
girl's
been
noticing
will
i've
deciphered
your
ingenious
code
ok
say
i've
been
noticing
oz
notice
someone
else
a
woman
and
is
this
chick
noticing
back
most
definitely
well
have
you
asked
oz
about
it
well
i
thought
about
it
but
then
he'll
think
i'm
all
jealous
and
worry
but
you
are
and
odds
are
he
feels
it
i'll
bet
that's
all
there
is
to
the
weird
you're
feeling
you
guys
should
talk
things
out
will
you'll
both
feel
better
got
out
huh
yeah
any
news
about
attacks
no
but
i
did
hear
about
a
woman
being
chased
by
two
wild
dogs
two
really
you
don't
remember
anything
like
that
do
you
another
wolf
no
when
the
change
comes
it's
likei'm
gone
total
blackout
you
know
i
find
wolf
number
two
out
on
patrol
tonight
and
you
might
have
a
roomie
in
there
oz
you
ok
and
if
it's
possible
you
seem
more
monosyllabic
than
usual
i'm
ok
thanks
so
this
is
why
you
called
me
here
to
see
your
habittrail
right
before
sunset
i
get
a
little
buzzed
you
know
come
here
i'm
not
getting
in
that
stupid
cage
with
you
if
that's
what
this
is
all
about
we
belong
outside
you
can't
run
loose
tonight
and
not
just
because
you
might
hurt
somebody
i
know
people
that'll
be
out
there
hunting
for
us
so
you're
saying
i
should
spend
the
whole
night
with
you
alone
locked
in
a
cage
you'll
be
safe
not
from
you
isn't
that
the
point
of
this
cozy
little
arrangement
it's
coming
do
you
feel
it
it's
like
blood
boiling
i
feel
it
i've
wanted
you
even
before
i
ever
saw
you
i
sensed
you
did
you
sense
me
come
in
here
did
you
willow
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
i
know
what
you
saw
it
wasn't
i
had
to
i
had
to
lock
her
in
there
with
me
i
bet
she's
like
me
a
wolf
well
i
knew
you
two
had
a
lot
in
common
but
don't
touch
me
she
was
gonna
hurt
somebody
i
didn't
have
a
choice
but
you
did
you
could've
told
somebody
your
solution
just
put
you
two
together
in
a
room
all
night
girl's
got
a
point
leave
i'm
just
saying
now
i'm
sorry
i
know
i
knew
you
jerk
and
you
sat
there
and
you
told
me
everything
was
fine
and
that's
as
bad
as
as
i
know
how
it
feels
i
remember
oh
so
what
this
is
payback
i
had
this
coming
no
it's
not
because
i
thought
that
was
behind
us
and
you
know
what
happened
with
xander
it
doesn't
compare
not
with
what
you
and
i
had
not
with
whatever
you've
been
doing
with
her
i
don't
know
what
veruca
and
i
have
done
when
i
change
it's
like
it's
like
i'm
gone
and
the
wolf
takes
over
but
before
this
when
you
were
regular
oz
you
had
feelings
for
her
didn't
you
no
i
could
sense
something
but
but
you
wanted
her
like
in
an
animal
way
likemore
than
you
wanted
me
willow
willow
are
you
ok
thank
you
i
was
too
far
away
it
was
lucky
she
almost
got
hit
willow
what's
the
matter

not
worth
hurting
yourself
over

have
to
go

have
to
find
veruca
before
the
sun

around
ok
thanks
man
where
is
she
i
don't
know
i
already
checked
all
the
usual
haunts
but
i
know
the
areas
we're
drawn
to
i'm
pretty
sure
i
can
follow
her
scent
we'll
try
that
then
look
buffy
you
should
know
that
oz
now
might
be
a
good
time
for
your
trademark
stoicism
i
conjure
thee
by
barabbas
by
satanas
and
the
devil
as
thou
art
burning
let
oz
and
veruca's
deceitful
hearts
be
broken
this
way
i
conjure
thee
by
the
saracen
queen
and
the
name
of
hell
let
them
find
no
love
or
solace
let
them
find
no
peace
as
well
she's
near
here
i
can
smell
her
or
the
dirty
pile
of
clothing
she
left
on
the
ground
well
they
could
be
from
the
other
night
when
she
turned
into
a
werewolf
unless
she
wanted
to
throw
you
off
the
scent
willow
let
this
image
seal
his
fate
not
to
love
only
hate
wow
for
a
minute
there
i
thought
you
might
actually
play
rough
sometimes
you
have
to
you
know
to
keep
what's
yours
sometimes
you
have
to
kill
how
'bout
that
the
sun's
almost
down
can't
say
i'm
surprised
you
didn't
go
through
with
your
little
hex
you
don't
have
the
teeth
you
don't
know
what
i
have
you
don't
know
anything
about
me
i
know
what
you
love
i
have
his
scent
on
me
right
now
don't
touch
her
again
come
stop
me
i
like
it
rough
remember
you
wanna
hurt
me
hurt
me
you
leave
her
out
of
this
how
can
i
she's
the
reason
you're
living
in
cages
she's
blinding
you
when
she's
gone
you'll
be
able
to
admit
what
you
are
you
don't
wanna
find
out
what
i
am
you're
an
animal
animals
kill
you're
right
we
kill
oz
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
there
was
just
so
much
going
on
with
oz
and
willow
and
there
still
is
but
i
just
thought
you
should
know
well
this
fellow
in
the
woods
he
was
in
military
garb
and
he
was
toting
some
serious
weaponry
the
thing
is
i
saw
some
guys
dressed
exactly
like
him
on
halloween
night
i
just
assumed
they
were
in
costume
but
maybe
they
were
working
i
wanna
know
what's
up
the
guy
got
in
my
way
i
almost
didn't
catch
up
with
oz
in
time
and
as
it
was
i
was
too
late
to
you
saved
willow
right
now
she
wishes
i
hadn't
giles
i've
never
seen
her
like
this
it's
like
it
hurts
too
much
to
form
words
you've
you've
felt
that
way
yourself
and
you
got
through
it
yeah
i
ran
away
and
went
to
hell
and
then
got
through
it
i'm
kind
of
hoping
she
doesn't
use
me
as
a
model
fair
enough
i
just
don't
know
how
they're
gonna
deal
with
this
hello
hi
what
are
you
doing
i'm
going
now
mmhmm
that's
your
solution
that's
my
decision
don't
i
get
any
say
in
this
no
veruca
was
right
about
something
the
wolf
is
inside
me
all
the
time
and
i
don't
know
where
that
line
is
anymore
between
me
and
it
and
until
i
figure
out
what
that
means
i
shouldn't
be
around
you
or
anybody
well
that
could
be
a
problem
'cause
people
kind
of
a
planetary
epidemic
i'll
find
someplace
well
how
long
i
don't
know
oz
don't
you
love
me
my
whole
life
i've
never
loved
anything
else
oz
oh
god
oz
