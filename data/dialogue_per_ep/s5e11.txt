you
ever
have
that
feeling
where
there's
something
you
know
you're
supposed
to
do
and
you
forgot
what
it
was
nope
i've
been
having
that
feeling
i
just
realized
what
it
was
like
three
weeks
ago
riley
asked
me
to
borrow
a
crescent
wrench
i
keep
having
this
feeling
like
i'm
supposed
to
give
it
to
him
well
that's
not
going
to
happen
unless
he
comes
back
you
know
not
to
get
the
crescent
wrench
just
to
come
back
i
just
mean
sometimes
i
sort
of
forget
that
he's
gone
it's
like
where's
riley
oh
wait
the
central
republic
of
whereinthehell
xander
if
you
ever
decide
to
go
i
want
a
warning
you
know
big
flashing
red
lights
andandand
one
of
those
clocks
that
counts
down
like
a
bomb
in
a
movie
and
there's
a
whole
bunch
of
of
colored
wires
and
i'm
not
sure
which
is
the
right
one
to
cut
but
i
guess
the
green
one
and
then
at
the
last
second
no
the
red
one
and
then
click
it
stops
with
threetenths
of
a
second
left
but
then
you
don't
leave
like
that
okay
check
big
bomb
clock
come
here
maybe
it's
her
huh
well
maybe
it
won't
happen
to
us
because
it's
all
about
her
messing
things
up
she
couldn't
make
it
work
with
angel
and
then
she
let
riley
go
away
yeah
relationship
debris
is
kind
of
piling
up
on
the
buffy
highway
hmm
humans
make
the
same
mistakes
over
and
over
i
saw
it
when
i
was
a
vengeance
demon
some
guy
dumps
a
girl
she
calls
me
i
exact
vengeance
blah
blah
blah
the
next
year
same
girl
different
guy
i
mean
after
you
smite
a
few
of
'em
you
start
going
my
goodness
young
lady
maybe
you're
doing
something
wrong
here
too
i
don't
think
it's
a
pattern
with
her
no
it's
just
you
know
now
that
it
happened
again
man
number
two
i
wonder
how
she's
dealing
with
it
what
what
what
was
that
he
looked
like
a
a
demon
yeah
he
did
are
you
okay
yeah
i
think
so
here
so
um
aabout
being
a
nun
you
know
um
with
the
whole
abjuring
the
company
of
men
you
know
how's
that
working
for
you
the
abjuring
um
good
yeah
do
you
do
you
have
to
be
like
superreligious
well
uh
how's
the
food
all
right
switch
left
lead
so
you
really
think
they
might
be
able
to
help
us
uh
if
you
mean
are
they
gonna
help
us
find
out
something
about
glory
i
saw
that
coming
you're
dropping
your
shoulder
uh
the
resources
that
the
watchers
council
has
at
their
disposal
i
mean
the
central
library
alone
is
just
don't
talk
about
the
books
again
you
get
all
and
sometimes
there's
drool
i'm
sorry
but
we
we've
really
exhausted
the
materials
i
have
here
and
we're
coming
up
empty
you're
you're
still
dropping
your
shoulder
i
can
see
when
you're
gonna
go
with
your
right
you're
doing
it
again
ow
sorry
sorry
so
glory's
all
you're
gonna
talk
to
them
about
right
let's
let's
take
a
break
answer
me
i
i'm
not
gonna
mention
dawn's
name
i
wouldn't
do
that
i
promise
but
you're
gonna
tell
them
about
the
key
that
glory's
looking
for
something
called
the
key
well
knowing
her
goal
is
is
crucial
i
mean
iiif
anything
helps
them
uncover
her
origins
her
her
plans
i
know
it's
just
i
trust
these
watchers
about
as
far
as
you
could
throw
them
thank
you
very
much
i'm
just
freaked
about
the
idea
of
giving
them
any
information
that
could
possibly
lead
them
to
dawn
truly
buffy
if
i
saw
an
alternative
if
if
the
initiative
were
still
around
i'd
consider
using
them
but
they're
gone
and
then
riley
was
was
uh
the
last
link
we
had
to
the
government
sorry
i
didn't
mean
to
it's
okay
you
can
say
his
name
i'm
doing
all
right
these
things
happen
people
break
up
and
they
move
on
for
a
while
it
feels
like
the
end
of
the
world
you
know
but
big
picture
not
so
huge
not
so
huge
i
just
said
it
feels
like
the
end
of
the
world

teasing

of
i'll
be
okay

thrilled

certain
uh

finesse

have
finesse
coming
out
of
my
bottom
i
can
completely
lie
to
the
health
inspector

shopshape
xander
she's
talking
to
giles
like

her
stop
perhaps
i'd
better
call
the
airline
i'm
just
trying
to
help
out
xander
tell
her
schedule
an
earlier
flight
back
excuse
me
tell
her
that
i
don't
need
her
help
so
how
goes
the
slaying
i
killed
something
in
a
convent
last
night
in
any
other
room
a
frightening
declaration
here
a
welcome
distraction
tell
us
all
about
the
killing
buff
pretty
standard
vampire
staking
ooh
but
i
met
a
nun
and
she
let
me
try
on
her
wimple
okay
now
we're
back
to
frightening
you
you
with
the
actual
clothing
who
are
you
dawn
come
look
at
this
it's
hard
to
recognize
me
huh
whoa
no
more
bathrobe
hmm
i
looked
at
it
today
and
there
it
was
all
fuzzy
and
blue
and
i
just
couldn't
stand
it
any
more
i
don't
think
the
rest
of
us
will
miss
it
much
either
it
was
getting
a
little
ripe
mom
maybe
we
should
burn
it
it
would
keep
the
bugs
away
it
doesn't
smell
fine
fine
make
your
funny
jokes
at
the
expense
of
the
woman
with
the
hole
in
her
skull
let's
go
i
think
we've
tired
her
out
whatcha
doin'
playing
soccer
can
i
hang
out
in
here
don't
touch
anything
you
took
down
his
pictures
yeah
i
i
think
i
would've
done
that
sooner
like
boom
don't
wanna
see
that
face
again
it
wasn't
like
that
i
was
never
angry
with
him
okay
that's
a
lie
but
it's
not
like
i
don't
want
to
see
his
face
i
was
just
starting
to
kinda
like
the
guy
and
then
gone
so
fast
it
wasn't
really
so
fast
him
leaving
according
to
everyone
who
isn't
me
it
was
kind
of
gradual
oh
does
that
make
it
any
better
no
because
you
should
have
noticed
earlier
stop
being
insightful
it's
creepy
it
hurts
in
all
kinds
of
horrible
ways
in
the
way
where
i'm
furious
at
him
in
the
way
where
i
blame
myself
and
all
the
little
ways
i
imagine
how
i
could
have
fixed
things
it'll
get
better
won't
it
i
hope
so
yes
it
has
to
i'll
just
keep
going
like
i
have
been
and
every
day
it'll
get
a
little
bit
better
really
every
day
not
really
but
it'll
be
better
soon
it
still
feels
all
sudden
to
me
with
him
gone
where
no
one
can
talk
to
him
but
you
never
know
maybe
he'll
come
back
maybe
he'll
hate
the
jungle
or
maybe
he'll
want
to
give
it
another
try
i
could
say
all
the
things
i
didn't
get
to
say
um
there's
something
i
got
to
tell
you
about
showing
you
riley
in
that
place
i
didn't
mean
to

anyway
i
know
you're
feeling
all
betrayed
by
him
not
me
i
was
trying
to
help
you
know
not
like
i
made
him
be
there
after
all
actually
trying
to
help
you
best
intentions
i
mean
you
know
pretty
state
you'd
be
in
thinking
things
are
all
right
while
he's
toddling
halfway
round
the
bend
oh
i'll
insult
him
if
i
want
to
i'm
the
one
who's
on
your
side
me
doing
you
a
favor
and
you
being
dead
petty
about
it
me
getting
nothing
but
your
hatred
and
your
venom
and
you
ungrateful
bitch
bitch
buffy
there's
something
i
wanted
to
tell
you
good
and
and
hellebore
it's
up
and
to
the
right
hellebore
one
of
my
favorites
it's
powerful
stuff
i
tried
to
use
it
to
derat
amy
and
it
didn't
work
but
i
think
it
might
have
made
her
really
smart
she
keeps
giving
me
these
looks
like
she's
planning
something
rubbing
her
paws
together
hey
what
are
you
two
doing
oh
we're
gonna
try
out
a
few
spells
there's
this
thing
you
can
do
where
you
create
light
and
we
thought
what
if
you
could
make
like
simulated
sunlight
yeah
so
then
you
know
there
buffy
is
middle
of
the
night
and
she
finds
this
whole
nest
of
vamps
aand
then
she
just
goes
presto
only
it
won't
be
presto
exactly
and
and
voom
there's
a
a
floating
ball
of
sunlight
vamps
get
dusty
you
don't
wanna
look
right
at
it
though
that's
swell
but
you
can't
use
this
stuff
giles

bunch
of
stuff
including
that
fish
in
the
bowl
aand
but

let
it
out
he's
not
a
ball
of
sunshine
new
semester
new
classes
whole
new
vistas
of
knowledge

confused
and
intimidated

i
think
this
one's
gonna
be
kind
of
fun
greek
art's
gonna
touch
on
so
many
things
mythology
history
philosophy
the
professor
spit
too
much
when
he
talked
it
was
like
being
at
sea
world
the
first
five
rows
will
get
wet
that
was
just
you
know
um
enthusiasm
it
seemed
very
much
like
saliva
we'll
sit
farther
back
next
time
good
plan
i
need
to
keep
this
course
the
only
other
thing
that
fits
into
my
schedule
is
central
american
geopolitics
hmm
and
no
thank
you
i
even
hear
the
word
jungle
all
i
can
think
of
is
him
you
know
is
that
the
one
riley's
in
really
don't
need
a
daily
200
knife
in
the
heart
is
it
that
bad
sort
of
but
i'm
starting
to
get
perspective
on
the
whole
situation
you
know
maybe
riley's
where
he's
supposed
to
be
you
know
maybe
he
needed
to
be
where
he
was
needed
willow
says
that
things
always
happen
for
a
reason
but
you
ever
notice
people
only
say
that
about
bad
things
but
not
for
me
the
furrowed
brow
what
do
you
say
we
go
pick
up
willow
and
indulge
ourselves
in
a
little
afterschool
hamburger
i
guess
we
could
she
might
still
be
at
the
magic
shop
i
was
there
earlier
and
she
and
anya
kinda
got
in
this
little
squabble
xander
and
i
sort

have
a
miraculous
love
what
a
miraculous
love
there
that
parked
car
we're
still
on
his
trail
i
don't
even
get
how
we
made
that
guy
because

made
him
he
must
have
been
trapped
in
that
crystal
and
you
released
him
i
released
him
no
this
was
definitely
a
we
thing
or
or
a
you
thing

you
thing
look

find
the
reversal
spell

hurry
look
what
he
did
to
that
lamppost
i'm
trying
put

top
up
the
pages

all
blowy
well
i
don't
know
how
to
put
the
top
up
i

just
figured
out
what
the
left
pedal
does
it
makes
us
stop
you
don't
know
how
to
drive
why
didn't
you
say
you
don't
know
how
to
drive
well
i
couldn't
know
if
i
could
until
i
tried
could
i
this
is
very
very
bad
there
there's
an
ogre
on
the
loose
troll
what
troll
on
the
loose
now
hold
on
i'm
gonna
press
the
right
pedal
harder
i
expect
us
to
accelerate
there's
a
troll
on
the
loose
and
you're
gonna
crash
giles'
car
it's
likely
we're
going
very
fast
you
should
have
listened
to
me
and
not
done
the
spell
giles
put
me
in
charge
giles
can
be
an
idiot
the
smart
kind
but
still
xander
agreed
oh

xander
doesn't
step
out
of
line
well
what
do
you
mean
by
that
nothing
find
that
spell
quickly
whoa
that's
gone
hey
watch
it
oh
it's
you
spike
don't
let
me
stop
you
from
not
being
here
i
was
here
first
you
know
uhhuh
go
away
now
why
would
i
do
that
when
it's
bugging
you
so
much
having
me
here
they
have
chicken
wings
too
also
a
sort
of
a
flowershaped
thing
they
make
from
an
onion
it's
brilliant
are
you
talking
to
me
hoping
that
i'll
get
so
depressed
that
i'll
impale
myself
on
a
fork
right
in
front
of
you
lovely
thought
if
i
don't
hurt
you
myself
the
chip
wouldn't
zap
me
i
could
eat
you
that
way
beat
the
onion
thing
all
to
hell
hey
those
are
mine
my
my
someone's
in
a
temper
this
all
sympathetic
misery
borrowed
from
the
slayer
what
no
nothing
to
do
with
buffy
so
she's
all
right
then
not
uh
holding
grudges
what
are
you
talking
about
what
does
buffy
have
to
do
with
anything
what
grudges
oh
yeah
okay
no
need
to
talk
about
her
then
i'm
sure
she's
merrily
slaying
some
pals
of
mine
having
a
grand
old
time
this
is
very
bad
willow
anya
they're
not
back
there
either
they're
gone
buffy
something's
been
here
and
willow's
gone
don't
worry
we'll
get
her
back
i
promise
come
on
this
thing's
probably
leaving
a
huge
trail
puny
receptacle
rrrah
you
do
well
to
flee
townspeople
i
will
pillage
your
lands
and
dwellings
i
will
burn
your
crops
and
make
merry
sport
with
your
more
attractive
daughters
ha
ha
ha
mark
my
words
ooh
ale
i
smell
delicious
ale
and
they
get
in
these
fights
and
they're
both
looking
at
me
like
i'm
the
referee
also
sometimes
i'll
say
something
about
anya
and
willow'll
get
this
look
this
um
what
the
hell
do
you
see
in
her
look
i
know
that
look
lot
of
people
never
really
got
dru
you
know
well
she
was
insane
then
it's
like
well
i
get
all
torn
because
willow's
my
best
friend
and
i
really
value
her
opinion
but
uh
anya's
my
girlfriend
you
know
hmm
what
does
the
slayer
think
of
all
this
friction
in
the
ranks
can't
be
good
for
morale
i
don't
know
she's
a
little
preoccupied
maybe
it's
understandable
what
with
all
the
upset
all
the
blaming
of
innocent
bystanders
who
got
caught
up
in
the
mess
what
i
mean
did
she
want
to
be
made
a
fool
of
and
what
does
a
person
have
to
do
to
make
it
right
hey
watch
it
mate
on
second
thought
do
what
you
like
ale
yes
ah
fragrant
ale
so
uh
think
i
should
run
and
get
buffy
barmaid
bring
me
stronger
ale
and
some
plump
succulent
babies
to
eat
i'm
gonna
run
and
get
buffy
or
maybe
you
could
fight
him
yeah
i
could
do
that
but
i'm
paralyzed
with
not
caring
very
much
you
there
do
you
know
where
there
are
babies
what
do
you
think
the
hospital
what
shut
up
um
listen
i
find
myself
very
hungry
and
when
i'm
hungry
i
grow
short
of
patience
well
we
can
take
care
of
the
hungry
so
how's
about
you
just
sit
down
in
one
of
the
sturdier
chairs
and
we
can
have
a
calm
talk
and
something
to
eat
can
it
be
babies
well
not
so
much
oh
but
maybe
some
roast
pigs
and
stags
and
much
hearty
grog
they've
got
this
onion
thing
you
cannot
appease
me
do
not
try
more
ale
xander
you
shouldn't
be
here
there's
a
troll
uh
a
big
guy
hammer
i
think
i
noticed
him
i
wish
buffy
was
here
i'm
here
i
wish
i
had
a
million
dollars
just
checking
what's
going
on
where
did
he
come
from
hello
buffy
willow
stole
ingredients
and
released
him
from
a
purple
crystal
he's
a
troll
you
did
this
me
no
we
i
mean
us
uh
her
it's
very
complex
well
we
can
stop
him
willow
do
the
spell
uh
let
the
conjuring
be
stop
nobody
lets
me
finish
you
told
the
witch
to
do
that
anyanka

seem
determined
to
put
an
end
to
all
my
fun
just
like
you
always
did
when
we
were
dating
uh
um
you
dated
him
you
dated
a
troll
and
we're
what
surprised
by
this
well
he
wasn't
a
troll
then
you
know
he
was
just
a
big
dumb
guy
and
well
you
know
he
cheated
on
me
and
i
made
him
into
a
troll
which
by
the
way
is
how
i
got
the
job
as
a
vengeance
demon
i
did
not
cheat
not
in
my
heart
it
was
only
one
wench
i
i
had
had
a
great
deal
of
mead
next
thing
i
know
i'm
a
troll
ohh
ohh
you
did
this
anyanka
you
will
die
for
this
but
but
you
seem
to
enjoy
the
the
being
a
troll
i
adjusted
and
then
what
happened
witches
filthy
dirty
disgusting
witches
they
trapped
me
i
was
imprisoned
in
that
crystal
for
centuries
ohh
a
curse
on
all
witches
all
must
die
willow
again
uh
uh
let
the
conjuring
be
undone
return
the
beast
to
native
form
comes
toward
them
witch
you
must
stop
keep
it
far
from
us
and
ours
as
long
as
my
voice
shall
sound
it
did
not
work
okay
wait
uh
let
the
conjuring
where
is
he
gone
xander
follow
him
anya
willow
head
back
to
the
magic
shop
find
a
spell
that
will
actually
stop
him
what
are
you
doing
making
this
woman
more
comfortable
i'm
not
sampling
i'll
have
you
know
just
look
at
all
these
lovely
bloodcovered
people
i
could
but
not
a
taste
for
spike
not
a
lick
know
you
wouldn't
like
it
you
want
credit
for
not
feeding
on
bleeding
disaster
victims
well
yeah
you're
disgusting
what's
it
take
hurry
up
i'm
taking
everything
on
relocation
spells
suspension
spells
and
what
the
heck
spells
to
make
him
really
sleepy
'cause
slightly
better
in
case
we
need
'em
i'm
getting
more
of
all
the
things
you
stole
i
didn't
why
do
you
do
that
what
you're
so
rude
i
mean
sure
at
first
exdemon
doesn't
know
the
rules
well
you
been
here
forever
learn
the
rules
rules
are
stupid
great
whatever
i
just
thought
you
might
be
interested
in
learning
to
act
more
human
some
of
us
enjoy
it
oh
look
for
uh
spells
with
dimensional
portals
too
i
am
a
human
and
there
are
many
humans
who
are
stranger
than
me
uhhuh
but
unless
i'm
really
wrong
about
crazy
larry
down
at
the
bus
stop
he's
probably
not
gonna
turn
xander
into
a
troll
well
now
that's
a
very
complicated
proced
oh
you
think
i'm
gonna
hurt
xander
i
would
never
hurt
xander
you
really
think
i
would
do
that
anya
it's
what
you
do
you
spent
what
a
thousand
years
hurting
men
you
got
your
thousand
years
of
hurting
men
gold
watch
i
was
a
demon
then
and
and
i
don't
even
have
any
powers
now
is
this
the
spell
only
if
you
want
him
to
double
in
size
and
grow
extra
arms
which
let's
not
aand
by
the
way
you
weren't
a
demon
when
you
turned
olaf
into
lord
of
the
hammers
you
managed
that
also
there's
other
ways
to
hurt
xander
i
don't
do
magic
now
you're
the
one
with
that
kind
of
power
in
fact
d'hoffryn
offered
you
my
old
job
you're
closer
to
being
a
vengeance
demon
than
i
am
maybe
xander
should
be
afraid
of
you
xander's
my
best
friend
oh
and
you
don't
want
anyone
else
to
have
him
i
know

since
you
were
squalling
infants
together

sweep

and
and
poison
his
mind
against
me

as
inadequate
a
troll
as
you
were
a
boyfriend
uh
yyou're
hairy
and
unattractive
and
even
women
trolls
are
put
off
by
your
various
odors
instrumentum
ultionis
telum
fabuloso
surge
surge
terram
pro
voca
your
menacing
stance
is
merely
alarming
and
your
roar
is
less
than
fullthroated
desist
my
god
woman
it's
been
a
thousand
years
and
yet
you
are
as
aggravating
and
emasculating
as
ever
you
were
vola
cum
viribus
dominum
tuum
nega
vola
hey
good
job
you
too
very
irritating
so
your
power's
in
your
hammer
oh
yeah
i
forgot
he
still
has
all
that
troll
strength
you
shall
all
die
i
will
dispense
no
mercy
now
what
are
you
fighting
for
minuscule
blonde
one
your
friends
these
two
they
will
never
last
anyanka
is
very
difficult
to
live
with
and
he
he's
ludicrous
and
far
too
breakable
their
love
will
never
last
she's
got
him
now
poor
baby
you
really
dated
him
yes
but
you
like
me
better
right
yes
oh
and
willow
likes
you
too
but
not
in
a
sexy
way
you
know
'cause
she's
gay
and
she's
not
gonna
try
to
break
us
up
so
you
know
it's
all
okay
their
love
will
last

forever
let
the
transposition
be
complete
where
did
you
send
him
the
land
of
the
trolls
he'll
like
it
there
full
of
trolls
it's
hard
to
be
precise
though
alternate
universes
don't
stay
put
trying
to
send
him
to
a
specific
place
is
sort
of
like
like
trying
to
hit
a
puppy
by
throwing
a
live
bee
at
it
which
is
a
weird
image
and
you
should
all
just
forget
it
it's
possible
that
he's
in
the
land
of
perpetual
wednesday
or
the
crazy
melty
land
or
you
know
the
world
without
shrimp
there's
a
world
without
shrimp
i'm
allergic
he
he's
probably
in
troll
land
i
only
care
that
he's
not
here
and
i
got
this
nifty
souvenir
oops
the
place
is
trashed
enough
anyway
well
see
how
well
things
worked
out
and
look
at
you
guys
so
good
and
alive
and
together
so
together
and
good
and
alive
oh
god
i'm
i'm
just
so
happy
for
you
i
cringe
to
think
what
the
place
would
have
looked
like
if
i'd
been
away
for
longer
than
three
days
well
maybe
we
would
have
had
time
to
clean
it
up
you
know
if
willow
used
some
magicks
to
help
yes
'cause
nothing
could
possibly
go
wrong
with
that
rupert
i
still
don't
understand

oh
thank
you
why
the
other
watchers
made
you
go
all
the
way
to
england
when
they
don't
know
anything
well
they
don't
know
it
yet
i
mean
they
have
no
record
of
of
glory
or
anyone
like
her
but
uh
based
on
the
information
that
i've
given
them
they're
gonna
look
into
it
um
they
might
have
something
soon
what
about
the
key
were
they
all
over
it
yes
you
you
know
all
of
this
i
got
some
of
it
myself
buffy
told
me
the
rest
well
they're
interested
certainly
and
uh
full
of
theories
most
of
them
nonsensical
they
don't
know
that
it's
dawn
no
i
still
can't
begin
to
grasp
this
i
mean
she's
my
little
girl
i
it
is
disorienting
giles
what
happens
if
they
figure
it
out
what
would
they
do
i
don't
know
oh
i
can't
even
think
about
this
it's
too
