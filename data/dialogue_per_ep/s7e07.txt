breaks
up
with
and
then
last
year
big
surprise
he
comes
out
men
do
i
know
how
to
pick
'em
so
all
that
time
you
were
a
slayer
the
the
like
as
in
the
only
one
pretty
much
oh
so
when
you

kind
of
a
telling
statement

it
ah
psych
101

i
really
need

emotional
therapy

how
hard
it's
been
to
act
this
cool
calm
down
you're
doing
great
all
specs
are
within
parameters
you
keep
leaving
me
i
hate
it
when
you
leave
me
one
time
you
died
and
i
ended
up
a
mexican
we've
been
over
this
now
that
death
thing
was
all
part
of
the
master
plan
come
on
if
you
strike
me
down
i
shall
become
more
powerful
than
you
could
possibly
imagine
of
course
do
you
think
maybe
willow
could
kill
me
too
hey
don't
worry
if
short
round
pulls
off
his
end
of
the
bargain
we'll
both
become
gods
that
boy
is
our
last
hope
no
there
is
another
wait
really
who's
our
last
hope
no
i
was
just
going
with
it
it
was
a
thing
he's
our
last
hope
tara
is
it
you
she's
sorry
she
couldn't
come
herself
why
didn't
she
i
don't
understand
i
mean
if
you
can
manifest
yourself
she
just
can't
why
not
i
don't
understand
because
of
what
you
did
what
you
killed
people
you
can't
see
her
that's
just
how
it
is
i'm
sorry
butbut
she's
talking
to
you
andand
she
can
hear
me
tara
tara
i
miss
you
i
miss
you
so
much
can
she
hear
me
what's
happening
did
she
say
anything
what
did
she
go
away
she's
crying
no
no
don't
cry
don't
cry
sweetie
talk
to
me
she
misses
you
too
she
wishes
she
could
touch
you
me
too
oh
me
too
oh
god
tara
it
hurts
so
much
everyday
it's
like
this
giant
hole
and
it's
not
getting
better
it
will
it
can
how
you're
gone
but
you're
not
you're
strong
like
an
amazon
remember
i
do
i
remember
so
you
meet
someone
you
form
a
bond
but
it
never
lasts
do
you
mean
in
all
relationships
or
just
yours
my
parents
weren't
exactly
the
paragon
of
staytogethereyness
maybe
that's
part
of
it
i
think
there're
people
out
there
who'd
make
it
i
just
target
the
impossible
ones
with
deadly
accuracy
you
think
you
do
that
on
purpose
maybe
you're
trying
to
protect
yourself
protecting
myself
from
heartbreak
misery
sexual
violence
and
possible
death
not
so
much
from
committing
i
commit
i'm
committed
i'm
a
committee
so
it's
them
you're
reaching
out
they're
just
not
coming
through
it's
different
i
think
you're
confusing
me
because
you're
evil
i
just
think
you're
in
some
pain
herewhich
i
do
kind
of
enjoy
'cause
i'm
evil
nowbut
you
should
just
ease
up
on
yourself
it's
not
exactly
like
you
have
the
patent
on
bad
relationships
wouldn't
it
be
cool
if
i
did
and
what
are
yousupposed
to
be
settling
down
already
at
21
you
know
my
girlfriend
at
college
she's
so
sweet
we
have
this
great
thing
but
that
doesn't
mean
i'm
gonna
go
vampify
her
just
so
we
can
be
together
forever
sire
what
the
wordwhen
you
turn
a
human
into
a
vampireit's
you
sire
them
cool
it's
a
noun
too
oh
i
have
so
much
to
learn
come
on
isn't
this
insane
i
mean
i
was
afraid
to
talk
to
you
in
high
school
and
now
we're
like
mortal
enemies
hey
wouldn't
it
be
cool
if
we
became
nemeses
is
that
how
you
say
the
word
we're
gonna
have
to
fight
to
the
death
aren't
we
it's
the
timehonored
custom
wow
reality
just
shows
up
sometimes
doesn't
it
but
you
know
i've
got
the
bloodlust
pumping
and
i
kinda
get
it
i'm
looking
for
a
fight
and
oh
it's
nothing
personal
oh
no
i
mean
you've
been
great
and
fun
catching
up
i
haven't
really
kept
in
contact
with
many
of
my
friends
from
high
school
guess
i'll
be
looking
them
up
pretty
soon
yeah
hey
i
don't
mean
to
be
count
buttinsky
here
but
you
just
don't
seem
as
thrilled
is
it
because
we're
gonna
fight
's
'cause
i'm
gonna
win
hello
two
years
of
tae
kwon
do
and
vampire
strength
i
think
somebody's
counting
their
chickens
you're
not
leaving
this
graveyard
can't
let
ya
do
the
words
superiority
complex
mean
anything
to
you
you
think
i'm
gonna
let
you
go
kill
a
bunch
of
people
you
know
i'm
sworn
to
no
no
i
get
the
battle
against
evil
that's
not
the
issue
there
is
no
issue
don't
issue
me
just
answer
me
this
whose
fault
was
your
parents
divorce
ok
you
know
this
is
beyond
evil
this
is
insane
troll
logic
what
do
my
parents
have
to
do
with
i'm
just
curious
your
opinion
they
both
have
a
lot
of
off
the
top
of
your
head
my
dad
uhhuh
he
cheated
um
i
think
he
cheated
so
of
all
of
these
relationships
of
yoursthat
you
knew
subconsciously
were
totally
doomedwhose
fault
is
that
it's
incredibly
different
i
was
just
wondering
is
it
possible
even
a
little
bit
that
the
reason
you
have
trouble
connecting
to
guys
is
because
you
think
maybe
they're
not
worth
it
maybe
you
think
you're
better
than
them
say
there's
that
bloodlust
i
was
looking
for
struck
a
nerve
i'm
gonna
strike
a
nerve
cluster
in
a
minute
you
don't
get
off
this
i
don't
remember
you
being
this
annoying
you
don't
remember
me
at
all
yes
i
do
yeah
like
after
30
minutes
of
reminding
and
i
don't
take
it
personally
because
clearly
you
were
in
your
own
little
world
in
high
school
all
chosen
all
destiny
who
could
live
with
that
for
seven
years
and
not
feel
superior
i'm
not
my
god
if
anything
i
what
i
just
if
you
knew
what
i've
done
what
i've
let
myself
become
my
best
friends
don't
evenyou'd
laugh
you
heard
some
of
the
things
i've
done
to
them

here
to
kill
you
not
to
judge
you
the
last
guy

was
with
it

really
i
behaved
like
a
monster
treated
him
like
but
at
the
same
time
ii
let
him
completely
take
me
over
do
things
to
me
that
i'm
sorry
wow
i
didn't
mean
to
get
all
trueconfessions
there
i
don't
know
what's
wrong
with
me
there's
nothing
wrong
with
you
everyone's
got
issues

son
of
a
bitch

and
all
of
his
works
butdoes
he
exist
is
there
word
on
that
by
the
way
nothing
solid

i
keep
getting
off
topic
because
my
mind
is
racing
here
all
right
i'll
make
a
deal
with
you
we
fight
to
the
death
great
that
last
fight
was
just
exhilarating
and
i
actually
had
a
move
coming
up
to
block
that
stake
but
you
have
to
answer
one
question
and
if
i'm
right
i
get
to
ask
anythingno
secrets
no
defensiveness
anything
i
want
to
know
what's
your
question
your
last
relationshipwas
it
with
a
vampire
i
don't
know
where
to
start
um
after
warren
shot
youyou
know
all
about
that
what
happened
it
was
horrible
i
was
horrible
ii
lost
myself

regular
me

you
were
grieving
a
lot
of
people
grieve
they
don't
make
with
the
flaying
i
hurt
so
many
people
it
was
the
power

am
the
power
it's
in
me
did
i
mention
the
random
destruction
of
property
the
magic
box
is
not
so
much
a
box
now
the
power
is
bigger
than
you
are
i
know
but
things
are
more
clear
where
tara
is
where
we
are
we
can
see
your
path
and
you
have
to
stop
you
can't
use
magic
again
not
ever
black
magic
of
course
but
giles
says
it
isn't
as
simple
asas
quitting
it
all
coldturkey
it's
too
dangerous
you
can't
take
the
chance
that
you'll
lose
control
ii
don't
want
to
ii
can't
i
never
want
to
cause
that
kind
of
pain
of
course
you
don't
so
i
won't
i'm
gonna
be
ok

it
that
was
my
locker
combination
god
it's
been
bugging
me
all
night
dude
we
spent
the
last
few
years
trying
to
forget
about
high
school
why
are
you
trying
so
hard
to
remember
it
i
don't
know
i
guess
i
miss
it
don't
you
yeah
i
really
miss
it
no
i'm
serious
i
really
miss
it
time
goes
by
and
everything
drops
away
all
the
cruelty
all
the
pain
all
that
humiliation
it
all
washes
away
i
miss
my
friends
i
miss
my
enemies
i
miss
the
people
i
talked
to
every
day
i
miss
the
people
who
never
knew
i
existed
i
miss
'em
all
i
want
to
talk
to
them
you
know
i
want
to
find
out
how
they're
doing
i
want
to
know
what's
going
on
in
their
lives
you
know
what
they
don't
wanna
talk
to
youall
those
people
you
just
mentioned
not
one
of
them
is
sitting
around
going
i
wonder
what
jonathan's
up
to
right
now
not
one
of
them
cares
about
you
well
i
still
care
about
them
that's
why
i'm
here
i
know
you're
there
i
will
cast
you
out
my
mother
needs
to
talk
to
me
i
cast
you
from
this
place
it
is
your
poison
and
your
bane
it
is
the
skin
that
is
cut
from
your
flesh
and
the
joke
is
he
loved
me
i
mean
in
his
own
sick
soulless
way
he
really
did
care
for
me
but
ii
didn't
want
to
be
loved
didn't
you
i
have
all
this
power
i
didn't
ask
for
it
i
don't
deserve
it
it's
like
i
wanted
to
be
punished
i
wanted
to
hurt
like
i
thought
i
deserved
i
sorta
thinkyou
know
this
is
um
complicated
if
you'd
rather
just
fight
tell
me
i
feel
like
i'm
worse
than
anyone
honestly
i'm
beneath
them
my
friends
my
boyfriends
i
feel
like
i'm
not
worthy
of
their
love
'cause
even
though
they
love
me
it
doesn't
mean
anything
'cause
their
opinions
don't
matter
they
don't
know
they
haven't
been
through
what
i've
been
through
they're
not
the
slayer
i
am
sometimes
i
feel
this
is
awfuli
feel
like
i'm
better
than
them
superior
until
you
can't
win
and
i
thought
i
was
diabolicalor
at
least
i
plan
to
be
you
do
have
a
superiority
complex
and
you've
got
an
inferiority
complex
about
it
kudos
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
oh
it
makes
every
kind
of
sense
and
it
all
adds
up
to
you
feeling
alone
but
buffy
everybody
feels
alone
everybody
is
until
you
die
speaking
of
you
ready
for
our
little
death
match

the
strength
of
