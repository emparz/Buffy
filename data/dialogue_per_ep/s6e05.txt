hello
buffy
oh
yep
it's
me
and
i
brought
dinner
deep
fried
chicken
parts
hope
you're
hungry
you
already
ate
no
well
uh
yes
obviously
uh
we
didn't
know
when
you'd
be
coming
back
it's
okay
more
for
me
i
don't
know
about
everybody
else
but
i
would
love
some
chicken
yes
as
would
i
i'll
take
a
drumstick
i'm
a
breast
girl
myself
but
then
again
you
knew
that
so
what
so
so
how
was
it
seeing
angel
him
seeing
you
was
it
weird
um
it
was
intense
well
iif
you
wanna
talk
about
it
i
don't
iit's
not
important
past
i'd
just
rather
keep
this
one
to
myself
if
that's
okay
sure
whatever
buffy
um
there
was
some
discussion
in
uh
your
absence
aabout
um
wwhat
you're
gonna
do
now
you
know
um
your
plans
oh
um
i've
been
giving
that
a
lot
of
thought
actually
i
think
i've
figured
it
out
what
i
should
do
that's
good
that's
good
yeah
i
figure
if
i
hold
off
paying
the
plumber
i
can
pay
the
utility
bill
and
then
i
can
wait
to
reshingle
the
roof
until
we
get
the
refund
back
um
i
meant
with
your
life
oh
life
plans
um
well
i
have
no
idea
i
guess
um
well
i
i
left
school
you
know
when
mom
got
sick
but
i
always
figured
i'd
go
back
and
then
she
um
so
ii
was
thinking
about
reenrolling
but
i
missed
the
registration
cutoff
busy
being
dead
and
all
well
if
it's
too
late
for
late
registration
and
too
early
for
early
you
can
always
come
to
classes
with
tara
and
me
right
yyou
can
audit
for
the
rest
of
the
semester
until
registration
audit
ii
guess
i
could
do
that
yeah
that
sounds
like
a
good
plan
what
do
you
think
giles
the
slayer
always
knows
what
she's
doing
sharp
decisive
always
with
a
plan
we're
never
gonna
become
the
crime
lords
of
sunnydale
with
her
always
one
step
ahead
of
us
well
that's
why
we're
throwing
these
tests
at
her
seeing
which
one
of
us
can
shake
her
up
the
most
maybe
find
a
weakness
or
two
she's
ready
sweet
run
me
through
it
ah
we
got
nine
highresolution
surveillance
cameras
hooked
in
superwide
angle
infrared
autoiris
plus
six
types
of
audio
matrix
monitoring
that's
filtered
through
a
dual
quad
dvs
system
and
a
yeah
yeah
fine
just
tell
me
are
you
sure
with
all
of
this
stuff
that
we'll
be
able
to
watch
buffy
without
her
noticing
us
absolutely
i
mean
she'll
never
even
know
wwhat
the
hell
is
that
death
star
dude
wicked
huh
thermal
exhaust
port's
above
the
main
port
numbnuts
for
your
information
i'm
using
the
empire's
revised
designs
from
return
of
the
jedi
that's
a
flawed
design
guys
okay
the
thing
is
since
we're
messing
with
the
slayer
who
could
pummel
the
three
of
us
into
a
sludgy
substance
it
might
be
a
good
idea
for
us
to
not
draw
attention
to
ourselves
i
could
paint
over
it
if
you
want
yeah
well
do
that
because
this
time
tomorrow
the
games
begin
and
the
slayer
will
never
even
know
what
hit
her
this
is
gonna
be
great
i
thought
it
might
be
a
little
weird
being
back
i
mean
it
is
weird
but
like
a
good
kind
of
weird
there's
the
teacher
mike
you'll
like
mike
you
call
your
teacher
mike
boy
school
sure
has
changed
since
my
day
social
construction
of
reality
who
can
tell
me
what
that
is
rachel
a
concept
involving
a
couple
of
opposing
theories
one
stressing
the
externality
and
independence
of
social
reality
from
individuals
and
the
flip
side
steve
that
each
individual
participates
fully
in
the
construction
of
his
or
her
own
life
good
and
who
can
expand
on
that
chuck
well
those
on
the
latter
side
of
the
theoretical
divide
stress
will
i'm
not
following
this
too
well
oh
the
trick
is
to
get
in
the
rhythm
kinda
go
with
the
flow
flowgoing
would
be
a
lot
easier
if
your
classmates
weren't
such
big
brains
buffy
that's
ridiculous
they
are
no
smarter
than
you
or
me
willow
because
social
phenomena
don't
have
unproblematic
objective
existences
they
have
to
be
interpreted
and
given
meanings
by
those
who
encounter
them
nicely
put
so
ruby
does
that
mean
there
are
countless
realities
what
you're
not
dumb
just
rusty
maybe
i
should
ease
back
in
with
some
nontaxing
classes
like
introduction
to
pies
or
maybe
advanced
walking
hey
how'd
it
go
she
did
fine
sociology
not
a
big
fave
she
didn't
like
mike
no
look
it's
fine
i
just
need
to
spend
a
little
more
time
reacclimating
you
know
to
get
back
into
the
swing
of
things
hey
you
could
at
least
say
sorry
rudeo
everybody's
in
a
hurry
francis
7
this
is
logan
5
i'm
in
position
do
you
copy
yeah
warren

copy
that
and
you're

on
the
monitor
hey
warren

got
engrossed
in
that
renaissance
book
i
guess
i
must
have
spaced
out
oh
ii
do
that
sometimes
once
willow
and
i
were
watching
spongebob
squarepants
buffy

eight

split
the
diff

it
a
seven

workforce
being
a
breadwinner
building
things
with
my
hands
uh
actually
you
won't
be
building
so
much
as
lifting

toting
toting
it's

a
temp
gig

it
tanks
since

a
few

i'll
tell
you
what
she
did
i
came
over
to
tell
your
friend
i
was
impressed
by
the
job
she
was
doing
liking
the
way
she
handles
herself
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
goes
berserk
and
attacks
me
wh
i
saved
you
from
the
the
demons
they
were
these
three
big
apey
things
no
no
not
here
not
at
my
job
that's
your
job
i
can't
help
where
the
forces
of
darkness
attack
me
xander
buffy
would
you
look
at
this
mess
do
you
have
any
idea
how
much
it's
gonna
cost
to
repair
this
and
what
am
i
supposed
to
say
to
the
clients
should
i
just
show
them
the
demon
bodies
and
say
it's
all
their
fault
you
can't
they
melted
but
uh

there
there
are
witnesses
vince
vince
you'll
tell
him
right
how
i
jumped
in
and
protected
you
from
those
things
hey
i
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about
all
i
know
is
you
were
losin'
it
or
something
that
time
of
the
month
huh
what
you
were
huddled
in
a
corner
crying
like
a
baby
hey
hey
no
way
me
crying
you're
trippin'
sweetie
what's
her
problem
i
didn't
imagine
this
xander
i
know
i
believe
you
in
fact
i'm
starting
to
think
between
this
attack
and
the
school
thing
that
somebody's
messin'
with
you
really
you
think
they're
connected
well
there's
something
going
on
i
think
it's
worth
checking
out
and
i
don't
mean
later
you
need
to
see
giles
and
get
on
it
right
away
i'd
start
with
id'ing
those
demons
you're
firing
me
aren't
you
big
time
the
whole
melty
thing
oughta
help
narrow
it
down
uh
try
sketching
them
that
always
helps
and
then
maybe
when
i
get
off
work
i'll
help
you
go
through
the
mug
shots
this
is
gonna
be
great
you
know
i've
always
been
interested
in
um
interested
in
retail
uh
is
this
all
research
or
just
some
kind
of
stress
test
for
the
table
i
just
want
to
be
thorough
this
time
anomaly
and
then
the
the
demon
attacks
could
be
completely
unrelated
events
but
if
they're
not
you
might
be
in
some
danger
so
situation
normal
then
let's
review
um
you
record
returns
here
um
these
are
the
slips
for
special
orders
you
ship
them
wherever
the
customer
wants
and
uh
these
are
the
hold
slips
fill
out
two
hold
slips
for
each
item
oh
and
uh
be
sure
to
remove
the
items
from
the
shelf
um
i
can
illustrate
with
an
amusing
story
about
a
crystal
uh
see
there
was
this
certain
customer
who
wanted
to
purchase
a
sapphire
uh
sapphire
well
dingdong
right
and
so
anyway
i
this
is
so
dull
i
might
actually
have
fallen
asleep
and
be
dreaming
you
guys
why
is
the
slayer
here
anyway
she's
a
student
she's
a
construction
worker
and
now
she's
some
kind
of
selling
stuff
person
it's
like
she's
completely
without
focus
should
we
check
the
other
channels
for
free
cable
porn
guys
i'm
ready
i
need
you
to
hold
hands
with
each
other
well
you
know
what
homophobia
really
means
about
you
don't
you
stop
touching
my
magic
bone
shut
up
okay
okay
it's
in
latin
so
don't
laugh
it's
supposed
to
sound
like
this
opus
orbit
est
et
ea
in
medio
tempus
ad
calcem
intendit
approx
translation
the
work
is
a
circle
and
she
is
in
the
middle
the
time
stretches
out
buffy
a
word
in
your
ear
while
i
was
running
the
store
i
found
it
useful
to
imagine
myself
back
in
the
library
um
you
know
if
you
concentrate
on
service
and
and
not
on
making
a
sale
you're
more
likely
to
have
a
satisfied
customer
guess
i'll
have
to
find
my
own
style
yes
uh
quite
quite
quite
that
woman
go
sell
her
something
miss
which
candle
creates
a
more
you

well
not
exactly
i
made
it
so
she
had
to
satisfy
a
customer
with
a
task
that
resists
solving
maybe
i
shoulda
done
more
like
what
i
don't
know
like
make
her
kind
of
itchy
go
help
the
lady

by
too
quickly
for
you
no

i
don't
think
that's
exactly
the
problem
buffy
a
word
in
your
ear
um
if
you
uh
think
of
the
store
as
a
as
a
library
it'll
help
you
to
to
uh
concentrate
on
on
service
rather
than
selling
yes

then
i'm
going
to
marry
bob
dole
and
raise
penguins
in
guam
yes
uh
quite
quite
yes

hi
ya
like

anyway
this
mummy

ceased

it
is
an
exmummy

and
i
had
that
bonus
for

fired
but
the
biggest
component
has
to
be
how
long
it
took

the
longest
only
from
a
perspective
external
to
the
timeloops
from
mr
giles'
perspective

to
look
like
the
demon
the
slayer
touched
you
yeah
it
was
sexy
the
way
she
touched
me
real
hard
with
her
fists
i
only
looked
big
i
actually
had
the
proportional
strength
of
uh
me
guys
think
about
this
we
took
on
the
slayer
i
mean
we've
got
all
kinds
of
stuff
in
the
computer
now
speed
strength
reaction
time
we're
getting
what
we
need
to
really
become
a
threat
to
her
we
tested
her
faced
her
and
we
survived
unless
i
have
internal
injuries
that
will
eventually
kill
me
oh
of
course
but
barring
that
warren's
right
we
did
good
the
trio
versus
the
slayer
it's
not
over
plus
look
what
warren
and
me
discovered
by
accident
before
we
drove
away

free
cable
porn

any
better

think
at
one
point
i
actually
turned
completely
inside
out

i'm
sorry
i
didn't
uh
find
this
demon
with
my
research

wasn't
much
of
a
fight
i
got
lucky
i'm
really
screwing
up
giles
what
come
on
you
were
being
tested
sequentially
by
some
unknown
demon
i
don't
call
that
screwing
up
no
it
completely
is
i
let
the
demon
set
the
rules
go
easy
on
yourself
will
you
i
mean
you
don't
have
to
figure
the
whole
thing
out
at
once
you
know
job
and
everything
you're
pushing
yourself
too
hard
the
nice
people
at
the
phone

to
think
it's
not
hard
enough
well
maybe
there's
something
i
can
do
about
that
this
is
um
i
it's
for
you
a
check

is
is
too
