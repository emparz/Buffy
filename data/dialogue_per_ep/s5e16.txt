die
a
good
while
before

there's
nothing

tell
me
because
it's
not
okay
for
you
to
be
asking
these
things
but
i
don't
understand
i
don't
understand
how
this
all
happens
how
we
go
through
this
i
mean
i
knew
her
and
then
she's
there's
just
a
body
and
i
don't
understand
why
she
just
can't
get
back
in
it
and
not
be
dead
anymore
it's
stupid
it's
mortal
and
stupid
and
and
xander's
crying
and
not
talking
and
and
i
was
having
fruit
punch
and
i
thought
well
joyce
will
never
have
any
more
fruit
punch
ever
and
she'll
never
have
eggs
or
yawn
or
brush
her
hair
not
ever
and
no
one
will
explain
to
me
why
we
don't
know
how
it
works
or
why
sorry
sorry
some
pentup
xander
where
did
your
hand
go
as
i
was
saying
some
frustration
and
now
uh
i
appear
to
be
stuck
my
god
is
your
hand
okay
pretty
much
i
i'm
really
sorry
you
could
have
hit
an
electrical
thing
and
once
again
with
the
sorry
did
it
make
you
feel
better
for
a
second
there
a
whole
second
in
my
defense
some
crappy
wallmanship
yeah
you
can
hear
everything
next
door
who
did
the
drywall
in
this
place
i
always
forget
to
ask
did
i
miss
something
xander
decided
that
he
blames
the
wall
can
you
turn
your
wrist
hold
on
it's
okay
it
hurts
here
wash
it
off
bandaids
underneath
i
couldn't
find
it
it
doesn't
matter
we
should
get
there
yes
i
i
wanna
be
there
for
buffy
you're
right
the
avengers
gotta
get
to
the
assembly
we'll
go
we'll
deal
we'll
help
that's
what
we
do
we
help
buffy
how
are
we
going
to
help
if
there's
anything
we
can
do
glad
you're
here
love
you
so
much
i
know
they're
not
telling
us
anything
doctor
okay
i've
examined
your
mother's
body
can
we
see
her
dawn
not
now
the
onsite
report
seems
more
or
less
accurate
your
mother
did
have
what
looks
like
an
aneurysm
a
sudden
hemorrhaging
from
a
ruptured
arterial
vessel
near
the
uh
where
the
tumor
was
removed
shouldn't
we
have
known
about
that
that
was
a
danger
sometimes
these
things
are
detectable
and
sometimes
they're
not
joyce
was
aware
of
the
possibility
of
a
rupture
and
the
effects
she
didn't
even
get
on
the
phone
so
clearly
this
was
very
sudden
she
uh
may
have
felt
a
little
nausea
and
probably
passed
out
as
it
happened
i
doubt
there
was
much
pain
and
even
if
someone
had
been
by
her
