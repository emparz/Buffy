i
think
i'm
gonna
be
sick
again
xander
we
don't
have
time
i
know
it's
just
what
happened
back
there
the
sounds
of
it
the
smell
i
know
willow
did
that
that's
why
we
have
to
keep
moving
you
heard
what
she
said
one
down
so
we're
talking
about
two
to
go
right
jonathan
and
whatshisface
the
other
guy
andrew
they're
sitting
at
county
jail
without
a
clue
willow's
coming
you
don't
think
she's
gonna
kill
them
too
she
wouldn't
it
doesn't
make
sense
willow's
got
an
addictive
personality
and
she
just
tasted
blood
she
could
be
there
already
no
she
couldn't
a
witch
at
her
level
she
can
only
go
airborne
it's
a
thing
more
flashy
impresses
the
locals
but
it
does
take
longer
longer
than
what
teleporting
right
vengeance
demon
well
at
least
she'll
get
there
first
i'm
counting
the
ways
that
could
go
wrong
well
anya
can
handle
herself
against
willow
tonight
don't
be
too
sure
well
she
should
be
coming
down
at
some
point
shouldn't
she
i
mean
back
there
she
was
out
of
her
head
running
on
grief
and
magicks
doesn't
matter
willow
just
killed
someone
killing
people
changes
you
believe
me
i
know
warren
was
a
coldblooded
killer
of
women
just
warming
up
you
ask
me
that
bastard
had
it
coming
to
him
maybe
andrew
and
jonathan
don't
this
is
still
willow
we're
dealing
with
right
i
hope
so
whatever
she's
going
through
we
have
to
stop
her
and
maybe
we
can
actually
do
that
if
we
can
get
to
your
car
willow
i
guess
she
wants
to
finish
the
job
without
us
tagging
along
meet
me
at
the
jail
sure
how
are
you
gonna
okay
then
i'll
just
catch
up
she's
only
my
best
friend
you
know
no
big
deal
just
glad
i
could
help
dude
move
like
a
foot
to
your
left
what
for
i'm
trying
to
hear
something
like
what
signals
oh
for
crying
out
loud
signals
who
from
your
probehappy
alien
friends
say
maybe
we
can
trade
a
pack
of
cigarettes
in
for
tin
foil
make
you
a
nice
antenna
hat
laugh
it
up
fuzzball
i
figured
it
out
warren
never
abandoned
us
well
not
me
anyway
this
is
like
his
test
if
we
can
figure
out
how
he's
communicating
with
us
then
we'll
be

worthy

false
epidermis
escape
kit

we
teamed
up
we
wanted
to
see
where
our
plans
would
take
us

take
a
look
this
is
it
maybe
for
you
anya
teleport
us
out
of
here
please

us
with
you
i
can't
it
doesn't
work
that
way
oh

for
a
second
and
listen
to
aah
what
is
that
sound
god
it
kills
we
have
to
make
a
run
for
it
are
you
kidding
she's
like
dark
phoenix
up
there
you
expect
us
just
to
outrun
her
pretty
much
get
in
is
she
coming
i
don't
see
anything
are
you
guys
all
right
are
you
injured
i
i
don't
think
so
where
are
you
taking
us
we'll
find
someplace
safe
and
we'll
keep
you
there
until
we
can
stop
willow
run
and
hide
that's
your
brilliant
plan
i
don't
believe
this
boys
if
you
don't
knock
it
off
i
will
pull
this
car
over
and
you
can
just
walk
to
your
painful
deaths
from
here
i
don't
get
it
willow's
a
witch
why
doesn't
she
just
you
know
wave
her
arms
and
make
us
dead
because
she
doesn't
want
you
dead
she
wants
to
kill
you
but
we
didn't
do
anything
ow
hate
to
admit
it
buff
but
jonathan
may
have
a
point
why
isn't
she
right
here
right
now
maybe
she's
just
getting
her
mojo
up
and
running
or
maybe
she
hasn't
figured
out
exactly
how
much
power
she
really
has
yet
neither
have
we
guess
we
keep
running
then
i
still
can't
believe
that
was
willow
i
mean
i've
known
her
almost
as
long
as
you
guys
willow
was
you
know
she
packed
her
own
lunches
and
wore
floods
and
was
always
just
willow
geez
it
what
was
that
just
willow
ookay
any
ideas
drive
faster
this
is
faster
she
knows
you're
in
this
car
too
right
right
she's
draining
she's
whating
just
keep
going
cool
not
that
i'm
knocking
the
nacho
cheese
ones
i
like
the
taste
it's
just
the
texture
i
can't
deal
with
so
gritty
kinda
hurts
my
tongue
so
i'd
give
'em
a
seven
maybe
a
sevenfive
and
you
think
this
is
dumb
don't
you
uh
no
no
as
taste
tests
go
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
i've
been
to
clem
i
get
it
no
biggie
uh
you
wanna
play
cards
clem
i
can
be
a
real
boredombuster
if
you
just
give
me
half
a
chance
it's
not
you
still
i
feel
responsible
it's
not
fair
girl
your
age
cooped
up
in
a
crypt
tell
you
what
let
me
get
my
hat
and
coat
i'll
take
you
to
a
movie
we'll
go
nuts
pgthirteen
clem
uhhuh
look
at
me
do
i
look
weak
to
you
oor
incapable
heck
no
so
why
am
i
stuck
here
no
good
reason
i
can
see
i'm
still
real
sorry
about
what
happened
if
there's
anything
i
can
do
to
help
just
name
it
anything
ohh
you're
not
going
to
get
yourself
in
trouble
now
are
you
or
me
'cause
your
sister's
the
slayer
i'm
a
demon
that's
real
good
incentive
to
get
along
with
her
i
need
a
demon
to
help
me
spike
would
have
spike's
gone
you
understand
then
yeah
yeah
it's
not
like
you
haven't
been
clear
about
it
oh
great
mysterious
one
this
is
a
test
i
don't
get
what
i
want
unless
i
pass
said
test
that
about
the
size
and
shape
yes
and
since
your
pad
is
decked
out
gladiatorstyle
and
no
number
two
pencils
have
been
provided
i
guess
we're
not
starting
with
the
written
oh
here
we
go
then
just
me
and
the
walking
action
figure
i'm
venturing
this
would
be
the
killorbekilled
type
of
situation
then
to
the
death
right
here
we
are
now
entertain
us
oh
son
of
a
b
rack's
place
was
right
around
here
last
time
oh
huh
i
don't
feel
anything
oh
well
not
here
let's
go
home
you
don't
feel
anything
because
his
place
moves
i
told
you
know
why
rack
moves
all
the
time
because
he's
shady
a
bad
element
comes
down
here
i
get
that
but
willow's
part
of
it
now
she
is
the
element
if
she
isn't
around
somewhere
rack
may
know
where
she
is
which
is
why
we
need
to
talk
to
him
we
in
a
face
to
face
way
or
me
i'll
go
in
there
without
you
no
no
it's
fine
i'm
good
it's
just
rack
isn't
partial
to
the
floppyeared
he
has
a
thing
but
but
hey
i'm
in
absolutely
either
way
just
get
me
there
say
rack
does
know
where
willow
is
he's
not
going
to
tell
you
for
nothing
he's
gonna
want
something
i
have
money
that's
not
the
kind
of
something
he's
gonna
want
rack
likes
little
girls
i
am
not
a
little
girl
i
i
don't
know
if
you've
thought
this
through
i'm
supposed
to
keep
you
safe
and
this
whole
thing
is
i
mean
even
if
you
find
willow
you
really
think
you
can
stop
her
thanks
anya
for
getting
here
so
fast
it's
a
big
help
once
again
xander
in
need
of
the
big
help
whatever
so
can
you
still
sense
willow
knowing
her
location'd
be
a
real
big
comfort
right
about
now
no
i
can't
which
means
whatever
she's
feeling
it's
gone
way
beyond
simple
vengeance
did
i
mention
me
needing
the
comfort
whatever
we've
got
better
grab
it
fast
this
is
one
of
the
first
places
she's
gonna
think
to
look
for
us
then
what
are
we
doing
here
you
know
i
could
summon
a
demon
that
would
kill
her
and
i
could
smack
you
so
hard
your
eyeballs
would
switch
sockets
buffy
no
one
is
getting
killed
sit
down
we
need
to
find
some
sort
of
magicks
that'll
stop
willow
or
at
least
slow
her
down
xander
but
she
drained
the
place
took
everything
not
everything
what
is
it
um
book
of
protection
spells
antimagic
our
last
resort
think
you
can
work
this
stuff
ah
okay
well
the
good
news
is
text
is
intact
bad
news
is
ah
i
can't
read
a
word
of
it
it's
like
in
ancient
sumerian
or
something
could
i
take
a
look
at
it
shut
up
right
i
just
thought
you
know
as
long
as
you're
protecting
us
the
least
i
could
do
is
i'm
not
protecting
you
jonathan
none
of
us
are
we're
doing
this
for
willow
the
only
reason
it
happens
to
be
your
lucky
day
is
because
willow
kills
you
she
crosses
a
line
i
lose
a
friend
and
i
hate
losing
i
get
that
it's
just
you
know
she's
running
out
of
power
right
i
can
tell
i
can
practically
feel
it
i've
dabbled
in
the
magicks
i
think
willow's
in
a
league
of
her
own
about
now
dabbleboy
but
still
running
that
hot
for
that
long
it's
just
a
matter
of
time
before
you
gotta
recharge
no
matter
how
juiced
up
you
are
thank
you
now
you
remember
that
thing
we
talked
about
about
me
shutting
up
right
buffy
let's
say
this
works
and
we
stop
willow
from
working
the
hoodoo
for
a
minute
what
then
i
talk
to
her
great
and
say
what
look
whatever
she's
gonna
do
she
starts
with
those
two
they're
the
line
she
cannot
cross
and
if
she's
running
low
on
magicks
then
she's
probably
somewhere
right
now
trying
to
get
it
all
back
hey
babe
i
been
waiting
for
you
guess
the
rehab
didn't
take
huh
that's
the
way
it
goes
sometimes
but
i
gotta
say
i
could
feel
you
coming
a
mile
away
the
power
you
got
and
you
know
something
sweetness
i
liked
it
when
you
first
came
to
me
you
were
just
a
little
slip
of
a
girl
look
at
you
now
all
growed
up
so
full
of
dark
juice
and
you
still
taste
like
strawberries
only
now

you're
ripe
you
came
because
you
want
something
don't
you
i
thought
so
so
tell
me
strawberry
what
on
this
earth
do
you
want
just
to
take
a
little
tour
yay
clem
making
with
the
demon
senses
i
knew
you'd
find
this
place
it's
not
very
clean
don't
wig
out
on
me
again
it's
just
i'm
still
not
so
sure
you
should
be
here
i'm
not
so
sure
i
should
be
here
it'll
only
take
a
minute
come
on
you
wanna
wait
here
if
that
works
for
you
be
right
back
willow

the
magicks

kill
that
guy

improvement

me
i
have
to
go
why
so
you
can
run
and
tell
buffy
willow
please
just
listen
to
me
you
don't
have
to
talk
just
think
real
loud
i
can
hear
you

freaking
me
out
oh
don't
be
like
that
i'm
just
a
little
wired
and
i
have
some
things
to
do
i
thought
if
anybody'd
understand
i
miss
tara
too
but
this
what
you're
doing
here
this
is
not
the
way
to
go
you're
only
going
to
make
things
worse
but
i
promise
it's
not
too
late
to
you
miss
her
yes
did
you
cry
of
course
you
did
i
get
that
i
understand
the
crying
you
cry
because
you're
human
but
you
weren't
always
yes
i
was
no
please
you're
telling
me
you
don't
remember
you
used
to
be
some
mystic
ball
of
energy
maybe
that's
why
you're
crying
all
the
time
dawnie
'cause
you
don't
belong
here
wanna
go
back
end
the
pain
you'll
be
happier
i'll
be
happier
we'll
all
be
a
lot
happier
without
listening
to
the
constant
whining
willow
stop
mom
buffy
tara
waah
it's
time
you
go
back
to
being
a
little
energy
ball

to
get
away
from
her

babylonian
the
text
is
similar
but
the
dialect
is
completely
different
great
babylonian
thanks
a
bushel
but
unless
you
can
read
babylonian
why
don't
you
sit
back
down
why
are
you
helping
them
because
they're
saving
our
lives
you
moron
uhhuh
and
what
then
even
if
they
kill
that
wicca
bitch
you
think
they're
just
gonna
let
us
walk
they
own
us
so
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
look
around
you
know
magic
we're
in
a
magic
shop
we
can
take
them
the
books
are
sucked
dry
but
so
what
there's
still
like
tons
of
supplies
all
around
us
this
is
the
best
chance
we're
gonna
get
to
make
it
out
of
here
and
do
what
start
over
we
can
be
a
duo
you
and
me
you
can
even
be
the
leader
i
swear
i'll
take
orders
i
like
taking
orders
just
tell
me
what
to
do
you
want
an
order
grow
up
hey
now
play
nice
fellas
or
you'll
break
our
concentration
which
means
no
protection
spell
and
willow
will
make
you
two
boneless
chickens
skinless
too
and
then
what
you
think
your
little
witch
buddy's
gonna
stop
with
us
you
saw
her
she's
a
truckdriving
magic
mama
and
we've
got
maybe
seconds
before
darth
rosenberg
grinds
everybody
into
jawaburgers
and
not
one
of
you
bunch
has
the
midichlorians
to
stop
her
you've
never
had
any
tiny
bit
of
sex
have
you
the
annoying
virgin
has
a
point
what
if
willow
fillets
their
soles
and
then
comes
after
us
she
won't
you
don't
know
that
we're
her
friends
anya
her
family
she
would
never
hurt
us
she
tried
to
use
you
for
a
hood
ornament
xander
she
doesn't
care
if
you
live
or
die
guess
you
two
finally
have
something
in
common
i
care
if
you
live
or
die
xander
i'm
just
not
sure
which
one
i
want
again
with
the
comfort
look
we
both
know
things
might
get
ugly
at
uh
wiccapalooza
and
if
it
gets
really
bad
let
me
guess
you'll
propose
i
need
to
know
if
you're
gonna
turn
on
me
use
this
little
shindig
as
an
excuse
for
some
sweet
revenge
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
that
could
give
me
greater
or
more
lasting
satisfaction
than
to
reap
bloody
vengeance
upon
you
xander
harris
but
i
can't
not
officially
not
magically

so
smile
it's
your
lucky
day
you
got
away
with
it
i
can't
hurt
you
right
'cause
you
varnishing
the
table
with
spike
how
could
that
possibly
have
hurt
it
may
have
chafed
that
wasn't
vengeance
it
was
solace
look
i
really
can't
hurt
you
so
i'm
just
gonna
have
to
settle
for
hating
you
if
that's
what
you
need
to
do
don't
you
don't
get
to
play
the
martyr
i'm
not
you
know
none
of
this
would
be
happening
if
it
weren't
for
you
you
think
i
don't
know
that
you
think
i'm
the
hero
of
this
piece
i
saw
the
gun
before
warren
raised
it
i
i
saw
it
and
i
couldn't
move
he
shot
two
of
my
friends
before
i
could
even
you
want
me
to
know
how
useless
i
am
that
it's
my
fault
thanks

the
memo

was
talking
about
us

minute

gonna
hurt
her
buzzkill
she
tried
to

attacking
the
people
who
love
you
now
only
the
ones
in
my
way

not
you

i'm
doing
fine

my
own
thanks
dawn
get
out
of
here
go
don't
we're
all
friends
willow
i
know
what
you
want
to
do
but
you
have
to
listen
to
me
the
forces
inside
you
are
incredibly
powerful
they're
strong
but
you're
stronger
you
have
to
remember
you're
still
willow
let
me
tell
you
something
about
willow
she's
a
loser
and
she
always
has
been
people
picked
on
willow
in
junior
high
school
high
school
up
until
college
with
her
stupid
mousy
ways
and
now
willow's
a
junkie
i
can
help
the
only
thing
willow
was
ever
good
for
the
only
thing
i
had
going
for
me
were
the
moments
just
moments
when
tara
would
look
at
me
and
i
was
wonderful
and
that
will
never
happen
again
i
know
this
hurts
bad
but
willow
if
you
let
loose
with
the
magicks
it
will
never
end
promise
you
don't
want
that
why
not
because
you
lose
everything
your
friends
your
self
willow
if
you
let
this
control
you
then
the
world
goes
away
and
all
of
us
with
it
there's
so
much
to
live
for
will
there's
too
much
oh
please
this
is
your
pitch
buffy
you
hate
it
here
as
much
as
i
do
i'm
just
more
honest
about
it
that's
not
true
you're
trying
to
sell
me
on
the
world
the
one
where
you
lie
to
your
friends
when
you're
not
trying
to
kill
them
and
you
screw
a
vampire
just
to
feel
and
insane
asylums
are
the
comfy
alternative
this
world
buffy
it's
me
i
know
you
were
happier
when
you
were
in
the
ground
the
only
time
you
were
ever
at
peace
in
your
whole
life
is
when
you
were
dead
until
willow
brought
you
back
you
know
with
magic
oh
sorry
the
trip
can
be
kind
of
rough
if
you're
you
know
not
me
dawn

just
curious
just
because

huge
deal
for
me
six
years
as
a
side
man
and
now
i
get
to
be
the
slayer
a
killer
isn't
a
slayer
being
a
slayer
means
something
you
can't
conceive
of
oh
buffy
you
really
need
to
have
every
square
inch
of
your
ass
kicked
then
show
me
what
you
got
and
i'll
show
you
what
a
slayer
really
is
where
are
you
taking
us
someplace
safe
like
where
xander
i
don't
know
get
off
superbitch
i
can
help
you

i
thought
you
were
gonna
show
me
what
a
slayer
was
can't
run
any
more
i
need
to
breathe
if
you
wanna
keep
breathing
you
gotta
keep
moving
this
is
bogus
we
gotta
get
out
of
this
town
mexico
we
should
go
to
mexico
hey
you're
not
going
anywhere
we
just
gotta
find
a
place
to
hide
you
two
until
we
get
the
allclear
from
buffy
yeah
and
what
if
the
slayer's
dead
already
we're
just
supposed
to
sit
around
waiting
for
sabrina
to
show
up
and
disembowel
us
you
do
what
i
say
to
i
don't
think
so
well
hey
isn't
that
interesting
anya's
still
here
looks
like
i've
been
beating
on
the
wrong
gal
whoa
whoa
okay
andy
let's
just
put
the
sword
down
oh
no
way
i'm
not
gonna
die
because
of
something
i
didn't
even
do
you're
not
gonna
die
leave
him
alone
let
him
go
andrew
you
heard
me
you
let
me
go
first
uhuh
him
it's
your
move
no
yours
i'm
not
moving
i'm
not
gonna
budge
'til
right
now
ow
xander's
right
we're
not
leaving
sunnydale
when
this
is
over
you
and
i
are
going
back
to
jail
to
do
our
time
help
me
help
me
you're
hurting
me
you
can't
block
my
spells
if
you
can't
chant
and
you
can't
chant
if
you're
sleepin'
buffy
i
gotta
tell
ya
i
get
it
now
the
slayer
thing
really
isn't
about
the
violence
it's
about
the
power
and
there's
no
one
in
the
world
with
the
power
to
stop
me
now
i'd
like
to
test
that
theory
