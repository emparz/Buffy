look
i
know
mom
wants
to
gather
and
make
with
the
merry
tomorrow
night
but
with
everything
that's
going
on
this
is
exactly
what
you
need
a
20th
birthday
party
with
with
with
presents
and
funny
hats
and
and
those
candles
that
don't
blow
out
those
used
to
scare
me
me
too
i
just
don't
think
this
is
the
best
time
to
break
out
the
party
pinata
we
need
to
stay
focused
if
we're
gonna
find
a
way
to
stop
glory
we're
going
up
against
a
god
an
actual
mightierthanthou
god
well
you
know
what
they
say
the
bigger
they
are
the
faster
they
stomp
you
into
nothing
she's
right
i've
thrown
everything
i've
got
at
her
and
she
just
shrugs
it
off
then
we
have
to
find
something
heavier
to
throw
that
might
pose
some
difficulty
from
what
the
council's
been
able
to
discover
from
the
book
of
tarnis
and
and
and
other
sources
glory
and
two
of
her
fellow
hellgods
ruled
over
one
of
the
more
seriously
unpleasant
demon
dimensions
there's
more
than
one
oh
there
are
thousands
of
demon
dimensions
all
different
all
pushing
on
the
edges
of
our
reality
trying
to
find
a
way
in
i
guess
glory
found
one
the
question
is
why
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
here
just
vague
references
to
chaos
and
destruction
okay
so
we
know
where
glory's
from
what
do
we
know
about
her
you
know
she's
tough
yeah
but
but
no
bolts
of
lightning
no
blasts
of
fire
shouldn't
a
god
be
able
to
do
that
kind
of
stuff
uh
usually
yes
but
um
being
in
human
form
must
be
severely
limiting
her
powers
all
we
have
to
worry
about
right
now
is
she's
immortal
invulnerable
and
insane
a
crazy
hellgod
and
the
fun
just
keeps
on
leaving
from
what
i've
been
able
to
gather
her
living
in
this
world
is
seriously
affecting
her
mental
state
as
well
she's
only
being
able
to
keep
her
mind
intact
by
uh
extracting
energy
from
us
well
from
from
the
human
brain
she
she
she's
a
brainsucker
she
um

'absorbs
the
energies
that
bind
the
human
mind
into
a
cohesive
whole'
once
drained
all
that's
left
behind
is
uh
crazy
people
which
is
i'm
afraid
why
there's
been
a
marked
increase
in
the
ranks
of
the
mentally
unstable
here
in
sunnydale
at
least
vampires
just
kill
you
we
have
to
find
a
way
to
stop
her
oh
well
tara
and
i
can
work
on
some
tactical
spells
i
can
do
some
research
i
know
way
more
about
demon
dimensions
than
giles
does
well
i
do
this
is
great
longterm
plany
stuff
but
what
about
this
key
thingy
glory's
looking
for
yeah
i
mean
shouldn't
we
be
trying
to
find
it
before
she
does
i
don't
think
that's
what
we
should
be
worrying
about
right
now
they've
got
a
point
whatever
glory's
planning
on
opening
with
the
key
i'm
guessing
it
won't
be
filled
with
candy
and
flowers
so
where
should
we
start
looking
do
we
know
where
it
used
to
be
kept
who
saw
it
last
we
did
giles
and
me
we
we
know
where
it
is
you
what
you
know
and
you
didn't
tell
us
there
were
reasons
look
iif
glory
knew
that
you
guys
knew
where
it
was
i

ii
just
didn't
wanna
put
you
in
that
kind
of
danger
as
opposed
to
the
other
kind
we're
always
in
you
should
have
said
something
will
there
you're
right
it's
time
are
you
sure
if
they're
gonna
be
risking
their
lives
they
deserve
to
know
know
what
there's
something
that
you
need
to
know
about
dawn
the
link
must
be
severed
such
is
the
will
of
god
the
key
is
the
link
the
link
must
be
severed
such
is
the
will
of
god
the
key
is
the
link
the
link
must
be
severed
such
is
the
will
of
god
you
really
think
he
is
going
to
help
you
i
fear
your
faith
is
gravely
misplaced
shall
we
test
your
faith
now
never
send
a
minion
to
do
a
god's
work
hey
nice
sword
bet
it
hurts
you
guys
doin'
a
spell
dawn
hey
yyeah
we're
doing
an
early
warning
incantation
if
anything
hellgodishly
powerful
comes
within
a
hundred
feet
of
the
shop
then
screechy
siren
things
will
you
know
screech
this
should
give
us
a
headsup
so
we
can
hide
the
um
key
we
already
put
one
up
around
your
house
cool
can
i
help
well
i
don't
think
buffy
would
like
the
uh
black
arts
bumpin'
auras
with
the
littlest
summers
yeah
whatever
how
can
she
not
be
real
she's
real
she's
just
kinda
new
hey
we
on
the
case
yeah
right
on
top
perched
ready
for
action
how's
my
sweet
fancy
dawn
doing
fine
what's
up
with
you
did
you
get
into
the
sugar
again
you
make
a
very
pretty
little
girl
anya
you
wanna
help
me
with
that
thing
xander
needs
help
with
his
thing
i'm
not
sure
our
regular
workout
is
challenging
you
any
more
perhaps
we
should
make
it
harder
you
always
think
harder
is
better
maybe
next
time
i
patrol
i
should
carry
a
load
of
bricks
use
a
stake
made
of
butter
very
amusing
i'm
sure
dawn
feels
that
way
about
her
schoolwork
sometimes
that
true
how
was
school
today
um
the
usual
big
square
building
filled
with
boredom
and
despair
just
how
i
remember
it
so
what's
the
homework
sitch
we
have
to
imagine
what
we'll
be
like
ten
years
from
now
and
write
a
letter
to
our
future
self
the
teacher's
clearly
so
out
of
ideas
wanna
help
maybe
later
i
have
some
stuff
i
have
to
do
first
is
it
about
that
weird
girl
that
came
to
the
house
glory
and
no
it's
not
like
you'd
tell
me
anyway
dawn's
too
young
and
dawn's
too
delicate
right
a
young
delicate
pain
in
my
butt
i
just
think
you're
freakin'
out
'cause
you
have
to
fight
someone
prettier
than
you
that
is
the
case
right
glory
is
evil
and
powerful
and
in
no
way
prettier
than
me
i
just
think
you're
getting
soft
in
your
advanced
age
she
didn't
look
that
tough
to
me
okay
one
more
time
just
between
me
and
you
our
itsybitsy
little
secret
where
is
the
key
even
if
i
knew

die
a
thousand
deaths
before
i'd
tell
you
well
you
won't
need
a
thousand
sweetie

make
the
first
one
last
long
time

is
it

just
scared
of
letting
someone
in
shh

know
how
difficult
the
first
time

be
you

you
be
tucked
away
in
your
beddybye
all
warm
and
safe
where
nothing

standing
in
the
bushes
hugging
a
bent
box
of
chocolates
and
i'm
what
sneaking
out
to
braid
hair
and
watch
teletubbies
with
your
mates

i'm
breaking
into
the
magic
shop

to
steal
things
magic
shop
eh
all
number
of
beasties
between

a
little
red
riding
hood
like

bet
that

sit
too
well
with
big
sister

or
not
give
us
a
sec
i
usually
just
burst
through
doors
that's
right
who's
bad
now
girl
with
a
mission
eh
what's
the
caper
jewels
ancient
artifacts
or
just
plain
hard
cash
liberated
from
the
till
a
book
all
this
for
a
book
i
don't
want
the
book
just
what's
inside
i
think
it
was
giles'
notes
he
was
standing
here
and
when
i
turned
around
it
was
gone
where
did
he
learn
to
write
so
bloody
small
from
a
fruit
fly
wait
here's
something
uh
'tarnis
12th
century
one
of
the
founders
of
the
monks
of
the
order
of
dagon'
'their
sole
purpose
appears
to
have
been
as
protectors
of
the
key'
brownrobe
types
are
always
protecting
something
it's
the
only
way
they
can
justify
giving
up
girls
hey
troll
hammer
didn't
go
with
my
stuff
anyway
'the
key
is
not
directly
described
in
any
known
literature
but
all
research
indicates
an
energy
matrix
vibrating
at
a
dimensional
frequency
beyond
normal
human
perception
only
those
outside
reality
can
see
the
key's
true
nature'
outside
reality
what's
that
mean
mm
secondsight
blokes
mostly
or
even
just
your
runofthemill
lunatics
there
there's
no
one
in
there
i
know
what
you
are
what
else
does
it
say
about
this
key
is
it
made
out
of
gold
maybe
we
can
hock
it
split
the
take
um
'the
key
is
also
susceptible
to
necromanced
animal
detection
particularly
those
of
canine
or
serpent
construct'
'the
monks
possessed
the
ability
to
transform
energy
bend
reality'
blah
blah
blah
good
lord
giles
writes
as
dull
as
he
talks
doesn't
he
'they
started
work
but
the
council
has
suggested
to
us
that
they
were
interrupted
presumably
by
glory'
'they
obviously
did
manage
to
accomplish
the
taste'
'accomplish
the
task
they
had
to
be
certain
the
slayer
would
protect
it
with
her
life
so
they
sent
the
key
to
her
in
human
form
in
the
form
of
a
sister'
huh
i
guess
that's
you
nibblet
not
even
a
card
huh
i
wasn't
really
expecting
one
no
contact
with
civilians
there's
probably
a
code
name
for
it
you
know
like
radio
silence
it's
'greeting
card
silence'
sorry
maybe
it's
time
to
start
a
new
tradition
birthdays
without
boyfriends
it
could
be
just
as
much
fun
preaching
to
the
choir
here
baby
yeah
some
of
my
best
ohoh
my
god
is
this
blood
dawn
oh
baby
what
did
you
do

is
blood

can't
be
me
i'm
not

should
deal
with
this
okay
why
didn't
you
tell
me

were
going

be
better
if
we
waited
until
you
were
older
how
old

i
now
you're
fourteen
sweetheart

i
worry
because
my
sister
is
cutting
herself
yeah
how
do
you
know
maybe
this
is
just
another
fake
memory
from
my
fake
family
sweetheart
get
out
dawn
get
out
get
out
get
out
we
need
answers
giles
we
need
to
find
out
everything
we
can
about
the
key
what's
it
for
who
created
it
and
why
glory
has
a
big
girlgod
jones
for
it
this
isn't
about
her
it's
about
dawn
she
deserves
to
know
where
she
came
from
she
needs
to
know
or
it's
just
gonna
eat
away
at
her
how
did
she
find
these
how
did
she
get
in
here
ew
who's
been
using
the
urn
of
ishtar
as
an
ashtray
morning
sunshine
if
you've
come
around
for
eggs
or
sausage
i'm
fresh
out
hey

how
could
you
let
her
find
out
like
that
from
books

me
that
much
i
was

just
thought
she'd
be
safer
with
big
bad
looking
over
her
shoulder
she
shouldn't
have
found
out
like
that
you
didn't
think
you
could
keep
the
truth
from
her
forever
did
you
maybe
if
you
had
been
more
honest
with
her
in
the
first
place
you
wouldn't
be
trying
to
make
yourself
feel
better

see
one
then
two
then
the
picnic's
ruined
no
matter
how
many
we
kill
they'll
keep
coming
wave
after
wave
it's
time
to
set
old
animosities
aside
your
fate
is
directly
linked
to
her
magnificentlyscented
glorificus
she's
been
extremely
forgiving
of
your
considerable
foibles
up
until
now
but
if
you
persist
in
your
defiance
she'll
be
forced
to
to
what
what
is
she
going
to
do
send
a
sixpack
of
minions
to
bore
me
to
death
glory
can't
lay
a
finger
on
me
you
know
it
i
know
it
she
knows
it
so
save
the
threats
or
i'll
finish
the
job
i
started
on
your
head
we
can't
just
let
her
sit
up
there
all
alone
she
needs
time
we
can't
force
her
to
be
all
right
with
this
that's
your
answer
just
leave
her
alone
and
hope
that
everything
works
itself
out
no
but
if
i
were
her
i'd
want
a
little
bit
of
time
right
now
i
wouldn't
want
my
mother
and
my
sister
coming
at
me
from
all
sides
her
school
called
today
she
was
suspended
she
yelled
at
a
teacher
the
things
she
said
buffy
i
mean
she
never
used
language
like
that
she
probably
feels
like
she
can
say
or
do
anything
right
now
she's
not
real
we're
not
her
family
we
don't
even
know
what
she
is
how
can
you
talk
about
dawn
as
if
she's
a
thing
i'm
not
i'm
just
saying
that's
probably
how
she
feels
well
then
we
have
to
show
her
that
it
isn't
true
she
needs
to
know
that
she's
still
a
part
of
this
family
and
that
we
love
her
it's
not
that
simple
we're
not
gonna
be
able
to
fix
this
with
a
hug
and
a
kiss
and
a
bowl
of
soup
dawn
needs
to
know
where
she
came
from
she
needs
real
answers
what
she
needs
is
her
sister
buffy
not
the
slayer
the
slayer
is
the
only
thing
standing
between
dawn
and
this
god
from
the
bitch
dimension
that
wants
to
shove
her
in
some
kind
of
lock
and
give
her
a
good
twirl
mom
i
need
to
be
out
there
doing
my
job
oh
my
god
glory
it's
willow's
spell
wait
it's
not
glory
damn
it
dawn
buffy
no
no
she
could
have
burned
the
house
down
buffy
she's
gone
she
tore
up
her
room
she
burned
all
of
her
diaries
the
dawnmeister
chronicles
she's
been
keeping
those
since

i
mean
since
she
was
seven
i
remember
too
will
we
have
to
find
her
fast
before
glory
or
the
knights
of
hacknslash
figure
out
what
who
she
really
is
mom's
gonna
stay
at
home
in
case
she
shows
up
i
figure
we
split
up
and
sweep
the
city
anya
will
you
stay
here
in
case
she
shows
up
xander
giles
you
guys
take
the
center
of
town
willow
tara
west
side
spike
you
and
i'll
get
the
east
side
just
find
her
please
bet
you
can't
push
me
all
the
way
around
oh
yes
i
can
no
you
can't
there's
so
many
things
i
remember
seeing
dawn
hanging
with
her
listening
to
buffy
complain
about
her
mostly
that
last
one
how
could
it
be
that
all
those
things
never
really
happened
well
it
takes
some
getting
used
to
the
idea
of
a
bright
fourteenyearold
actually
being
living
energy
thousands
of
years
old
i'm
guessing
some
kind
of
superpowerful
in
her
raw
form
people
have
killed
died
for
it
summoned
armies
to
control
the
key
you
know
uh
she
kinda
has
a
crush
on
me
your
point
being
well
nothing
no
uh
just
saying
powerful
being
big
energy
gal
digging
the
xanman
some
guys
are
just
cooler
you
know
dawn
dawn
yeah
that
should
do
it
shut
up
the
nibblet
scampered
off
to
get
away
from
you
she
hears
you
bellowing
she's
gonna
pack
it
in
the
opposite
direction
can't
say
i
blame
her
you
were
right
this
is
my
fault
i
should
have
told
her
look
she
probably
would
have
skipped
off
anyway
even
if
she
never
found
out
she's
not
just
a
blob
of
energy
she's
also
a
fourteenyearold
hormone
bomb
which
one's
screwing
her
up
more
right
now
spin
the
bloody
wheel
you'll
find
her
just
in
the
nick
of
time
that's
what
you
hero
types
do
you'll
find
her
and
then
what
it's
here
it's
here
it's
here
can't
stop
it's
here
it's
here

it

been
a
lot
of
nights
i
wish
she
didn't
exist
either
it's
not
buffy
it's
me
i'm
the
one
that
doesn't
exist
look
i
know
it
can
feel
that
way
sometimes
but
when
you're
older
no
you
don't
understand
it's
not
real
none
of
this
they
made
it
dawn
i'm
nothing
i'm
just
a
thing
the
monks
made
so
glory
couldn't
find
me
i'm
not
real
you're
the
key
how
do
you
know
about
the
key
go
before
she
finds
you
don't
ask
me
how
she
knows
'cause
she
always
knows
just
go
wait
calm
down
just
tell
me
you
don't
understand
you're
a
kid
you
stay
she'll
find
you
she
finds
you
she'll
hurt
you
what's
wrong
with
you
you're
what
she's
been
searching
for
i
am
telling
you
run
you
don't
know
you

oh
god
oh
god
no
she's
coming
i
can
feel
it
you've
gotta
get
out
no
oh
no
she's
here
she's
here
hey
don't
i
know
you
ugh
cotton
could
a
fabric
be
more
annoyingly
pedestrian
now
this
is
what
i'm
talkin'
about
makes
your
skin
sing
you'reyou're
ben
uh
it's
an
eensy
more
complicated
than
that
family
always
is
isn't
it
you'd
never
make
it
i'd
rip
out
your
spine
before
you
got
half
a
step
and
those
little
legs
they
wouldn't
be
much
good
without
one
of
those
would
they
dawnie
now
what
i'm
trying
to
noodle
is
what
in
the
world
was
the
slayer's
little
sis
doing
here
with
gentle
ben
yyou
don't
remember
remember
what
you
were
talking
to
him
not
me
oh
he
wasn't
being
naughty
was
he
excuse
me
ma'am
this
area's
for
hospital
personnel
rude
i
was
talking
what
do
you
say

we
find
a
nice
place
off
the
beaten
where
you
and
i
can
have
a
long
uninterrupted
chat
we
looked
but
no
dawn
what
about
the
carousel
checked
there
too
nothing
sorry
buff
anything
could
have
happened
to
her
not
just
glory
we
better
check
the
hospital
okay
small
talk
over
i'm
in
a
bit
of
a
crunch
here
so
let's
cut
right
to
the
ooey
gooey
center
your
sister
the
slayer
has
my
key
it's
mine
i
want
it
do
you
know
where
she
squirreled
it
away
there's
ice
cream
and
puppydogs
in
it
for
you
if
you
start
singin'
i'm
not
sure
what
does
it
look
like
well
the
last
time
i
caught
a
peep
it
was
a
bright
green
swirly
shimmer
really
brought
out
the
blue
in
my
eyes
but
then
those
sneaky
little
monks
pulled
an
abracadabra
so
now
it
could
look
like
anything
you
see
the
predicament
i'm
in
maybe
yes
well
maybe
if
you
told
me
more
about
it
i'd
know
if
i've
seen
it
okay
she
wasn't
brought
in
which
is
a
happy
thing
right
i
don't
know
i
found
him
on
the
floor
in
the
break
room
you
guys
gotta
see
him
his
head's
almost
twisted
clean
off
glory
so
this
key
thing
it's
been
around
for
a
long
time
well
not
as
long
as
me
but
yeah
just
this
side
of
forever
is
it
evil
totally
well
no
not
really
i
guess
it
depends
on
your
point
of
view
what's
it
for
i
mean
if
it's
a
key
there's
gotta
be
a
lock
right
yes
we
have
a
winner
sso
what
does
it
open
i
smell
a
fox
in
my
hen
house
is
that
why
you've
been
playing
sugar
and
spice
with
old
uncle
ben
trying
to
get
a
peek
at
glory's
unmentionables
no
i
shh
i
kinda
wanna
hear
me
talking
right
now
me
talking
you
know
what
i'm
starting
to
think

thinking
that
maybe
you

don't
have
any
idea
where
my
key
is
very
irritating
irrational
know
what
i
mean
tiny
snapdragon
like
bugs
under
my
skin
and
say
i'm
feelin'
a
little
what's
wrong
with
you
hey
hey
this
doesn't
have
to
be
a
complete
waste
of
my
precious
time
i've
been
meaning
to
send
the
slayer
a
message
and
i
could
use
a
little
pickmeup
two
birds

stone

yummy
dead
birds

away
from
my
sister
