okay
you
get
fang
i'll
get
horny
i
mean
whoo
vampiredemon
tag
team
who
says
we
can't
all
get
along
don't
recall
ever
seeing
that
before
it
never
happened
vamps
hate
demons

like
stripes
and
polka
dots
major
clashing
so
uh
i
guess
we
should
tell
giles
about
this
right
i
mean
it's
the
kind
of
thing
he'd
wanna
know
about
uhhuh
like
as
soon
as
possible
as
soon
as
possible
i
mean
it
now
first
thing
in
the
morning
we
go
tell
giles
first
thing
good
plan
aw
come
on
big
party
at
riley's
house
it's
gonna
be
fun
why
don't
you
wanna
go
you
know
why
not
those
initiative
men
make
me
not
comfortable
and
you
don't
care
they
don't
even
know
that
you're
an
exdemon
and
we
don't
know
that
they'd
care
even
if
they
did
know
which
by
the
way
they're
not
gonna
find
out
anyways
they'll
probably
be
too
busy
flirting
with
every
other
girl
at
the
party
to
even
notice
you
so
you
don't
think
i'm
desirable
enough
to
be
flirted
with
is
that
it
i'm
just
not
gonna
win
here
am
i
you
don't
find
me
attractive
anymore
what
are
you
talking
about
i
think
you're
gorgeous
oh
really
well
then
why
didn't
we
have
sex
last
night
is
that
what
this
is
about
we've
gone
other
nights
without
sex
i
know
twice
i
can't
believe
we're
breaking
up
breaking
we're
not
are
we
of
course
we
are
you
you've
obviously
grown
tired
of
me
i
mean
i've
seen
it
happen
to
thousands
of
women
over
the
centuries
i
just
never
thought
it
would
happen
to
me
anya
there's
a
lot
more
to
you
and
me
than
the
sex
well
there
should
be
i
mean
a
relationship
is
something
that
you
work
at
work
through
together
i
don't
understand
i'm
pretty
i'm
young
i
mean
why
didn't
you
take
advantage
of
me
is
something
wrong
with
your
body
there's
nothing
wrong
with
my
body
well
there
must
be
i
saw
that
wrinkled
man
on
tv
talking
about
erectile
dysfunction
whoa
hey
all
systems
go
here
no
function
problem
okay
you
want
sex
let's
have
sex
right
here
hot
sweaty
big
sex
there's
always
been
great
discord
between
them
and
yet
you
say
that
the
the
vampire
went
to
the
demon's
aid
the
two
of
them
were
working
as
a
team
everything
except
giving
each
other
little
pats
on
the
behind
extraordinarily
odd
as
a
rule
demons
have
no
empathy
for
any
of
the
species
other
than
their
own
in
fact
most
think
of
vampires
as
abominations
mixing
with
human
blood
and
all
so
what
brought
these
two
together
not
what
who
adam
think
about
it
who
better
to
bring
together
a
bunch
of
demon
types
than
someone
who's
made
out
of
a
bunch
of
demon
types
so
he's
um
bridging
the
gap
between
the
races
huh
like
martin
luther
king
um
i
suggest
that
uh
over
the
next
several
nights
you
two
concentrate
your
patrol
in
that
same
area
if
there's
any
other
peculiar
pairings
or
groupings
you
let
me
know
i'll
let
the
squad
know
as
well
they're
patrolling
we'll
have
a
uh
reserve
unit
out
during
the
party
party
tomorrow
night
we're
having
a
thing
at
a
time
like
this
who
well
whose
idea
was
that
mine
boys
are
pretty
ragged
need
to
let
off
steam
point
taken
you're
welcome
to
come
well
much
as

good
kegger
i
have
other
plans
the
espresso

um
uh

a
meeting

interest

friendless

droopy
boy
on
your
arm
did
he
have
better
things

he
just
didn't
want
the
girls
to
see
him
with
his
eyebrows
all
burnt
off
he's
lucky
that's
all
he
lost
you
shoulda
seen
it
rye
weird
as
hell
mmhmm
how
many
kids
i
dunno
a
whole
herd
of
them
and
some
parents
to
boot
it
was
kind
of
embarrassing
which
welcome
to
life
with
anya
so
you
don't
even
know
if
she's
coming
tonight
i'm
thinking
no
she
was
pretty
upset
which
makes
me
wonder
is
it
me
am
i
the
crazy
one
uhhuh
absolutely
hey
buffy
this
might
be
a
good
time
to
mention
that
someone
so
not
me
spilled
something
purply
on
your
new
peasant
top
which
i
would
never
borrow
without
asking
still
love
me
uhhuh
huh
what
about
my
peasant
top
nothin'
xander
was
just
talking
about
anya
oh
it's
nothing
much
just
feeling
pretty
glad
right
now
that
a
certain
exdemon
doesn't
have
any
powers
boy
i
miss
those
powers
yeah
tell
me
about
it
a
year
and
a
half
ago
i
could
have
eviscerated
him
with
my
thoughts
now
i
can
barely
hurt
his
feelings
things
used
to
be
so
much
simpler
you
know
you
take
the
killing
for
granted
and
then
it's
gone
and
you're
like
i
wish
i'd
appreciated
it
more
stopped
and
smelled
the
corpses
you
know
yeah
now
everything's
complicated
it's
a
terrible
thing
love
is
i
been
there
myself
it
ended
badly
of
course
it
did
it
always
does
seen
a
thousand
relationships
first
there's
the
love
and
sex
and
then
there's
nothing
left
but
the
vengeance
that's
how
it
works
you
and
i
should
just
go
do
the
vengeance
both
of
us
you
eviscerate
xander
and
i'll
stake
dru
like
a
project
i
don't
know
i
just
can't
you
can
go
do
dru
though
yeah
i
will
maybe
later
see
the
thing
that
they're
afraid
to
teach
us
about
is
the
inherent
sensuality
of
language
i
mean
you
you
learn
french
and
they
make
it
all
about
conjugations
and
uh
fronted
vowels
but
nobody
really
talks
about
you
know
the
way
language
tastes
you
know
the
the
way
it
feels
rolling
over
your
tongue
i
mean
just
think
about
car
versus
voiture
oh
wow

you
all
right

probably
dead
unless
they're
too
busy
doin'
it
to
answer
doing
what
you
know
for
a
god
of
acoustic
rock
you're
kind
of
naive
i
didn't
think
you
meant
in
the
midst
of
all
that
do
you
really
think
they
were
keeping
it
up
oh
for
a
different
phrasing
well
see
that's
the
thing
people
all
over
the
party
were
starting
to
act
weird
sexually
in
what
way
you
know
ways
well
it
could
be
some
form
of
uh
succubi
or
a
satyr's
prank
it
could
even
be
energy
coming
from
the
the
lab
underneath
the
lowell
fraternity
it
wasn't
always
a
fraternity
look
between
1949
and
1960
the
lowell
home
for
children
housed
upwards
of
40
adolescents
runaways
juvenile
delinquents
and
emotionally
disturbed
teenagers
from
the
sunnydale
area
children
did
any
of
them
um
die
in
there
if
there
were
deaths
then
uh
perhaps
we're
dealing
with
a
fairly
standard
haunting
it
doesn't
say
it's
mostly
about
the
old
house
director
genevieve
holt
sunnydale
children's
aid
30
years
of
community
service
giving
disadvantaged
kids
the
love
and
care
they
deserve
when
did
she
die
she
didn't
no
no
i
don't
mind
at
all
i
was
up
early
morning
prayer
of
course
and
i
like
talking
about
my
kids
i
still
call
them
that
my
kids
i
i
suppose
you
were
like
a
mother
to
them
you
did
everything
for
them
oh
yes
i
fed
them
clothed
them
educated
them
in
the
way
of
the
lord
i
was
given
a
medal
yes
wonderful
uh
congratulations
um
this'll
sound
a
little
strange
but
ah
did
you
notice
any
odd
disturbances
in
the
house
i
don't
understand
wewell
um
like
uh
furniture
moving
of
its
own
accord
or
uh
objects
appearing
out
of
nowhere
or
or
perhaps
you
saw
someone
appear
one
moment
and
then
they
were
gone
the
next
iinexplicably
why
that
sounds
like
crazy
talk
yes
it
does
doesn't
it
yes
um
well
forgive
me
for
for
asking
this
but
um
the
children
in
your
care
were
any
of
them
ever
ill
or
did
anything
ever
happen
to
any
of
them
well
some
had
the
flu
and
such
no
one
died
if
that's
what
you
mean
the
engraving
on
the
medal
says
how
good
i
was
with
the
children
oh
yes
i
treated
them
as
i
would
my
own
flesh
and
blood
gave
them
hugs
and
praise
when
they
were
good
and
punished
them
when
they
were
dirty
well
ah
children
will
be
children
they
you
know
they
do
like
to
play
in
the
uh
the
muck
you
didn't
mean
mud
dirty
my
kids
didn't
think
i
knew
but
i
did
very
uh
perceptive
of
you
without
me
they
would
have
been
shut
out
of
the
kingdom
lost
to
lust
but
you
helped
them
the
girls
felt
the
vanity
more
than
the
boys
i'd
see
them
preening
like
jezebel
doting
over
their
pretty
hair
so
you'd
hack
it
off
i'd
remove
the
temptation
to
admire
themselves
they
were
better
for
it
what
about
the
bathtub
something
happened
there
i
performed
baptisms
on
the
most
unclean
those
who
were
tainted
with
impure
thought
and
deed
you
held
them
under
they
needed
to
be
reborn
you
choose
to
pass
judgment
on
me
well
someone
ought
to
you
traumatized
and
and
abused
these
children
children
who
who
have
no
doubt
become
extremely
disturbed
adults
you
have
ruined
lives
mrs
holt
furthermore
what
you
did
has
now
manifested
itself
as
a
a
malevolent
presence
which
threatens
still
more
lives
you
have
a
great
deal
to
answer
for
i
refuse
to
listen
to
this
when
i
can
smell
the
sin
on
each
and
every
one
of
you
yeah
you
smell
sin
well
let
me
tell
you
something
lady
she
who
smelt
it
dealt
it
it's
like
what
you
said
but
faster
well
that
totally
adds
to
my
old
people
are
crazy
theorem
i
don't
get
it
i
mean
those
kids
were
tortured
but
they
weren't
killed
so
where
are
those
ghosts
coming
from
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
ghosts
one
ran
right
through
me
not
a
ghost
an
apparition
i
believe
we're
dealing
with
a
kind
of
poltergeist
a
whole
cluster
of
them
in
fact
born
out
of
intense
adolescent
emotion
and
sexual
energy
both
of
which
were
totally
pentup
during
mrs
holt's
reign
of
repression
so
with
buffy
and
riley
having
you
know
acts
of
nakedness
around
the
clock
lately
maybe
they
set
something
free
like
a
big
burstin'
poltergasm
yes
and
now
the
poltergeists
are
drawing
more
and
more
energy
out
of
them
feeding
on
them
in
fact
buffy
and
riley
are
are
powering
this
whole
thing
okay
they're
the
battery
in
the
boo
factory
so
what
happens
when
the
battery's
drained
they
die
don't
stop
never
stop
touching
me
what
good
are
weapons
against
disembodied
spirits
xander
they
have
no
ass
to
kick
she's
right
you
should
just
stay
outside
we'll
bind
the
spirits
long
enough
for
you
to
get
riley
and
buffy
out
how
much
time
will
you
buy
us
could
be
tricky
we're
calling
upon
the
communal
spirit
of
a
certain
time
and
place
let's
go

sad
