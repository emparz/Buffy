was
obviously
in
charge

was
a
puppet

using

didn't
seem
like
the
type
of
guy
who
would
let
himself
be
used
well
that
was
her
genius
he
didn't
even
know
he
was
playing

late
nights
at
the
gallery
recently
i
gather
you

cataloging
more
than
art
well
i
i've
been
looking
for
the
right
moment
to
introduce
you
two
he's
a
wonderful
man
sprinkle
that
on
uh
a
little
more
okay
more
how'd
you
meet
oh
he
sells
uh
computer
software
he
redid
my
entire
system
at
the
gallery
freed
up
a
lot
of
my
time
to
meet
new
people
and
smooch
them
in
my
kitchen
you
weren't
supposed
to
see
that
i
like
my
new
ninegig
hard
drive
but
you
don't
love
it
'cause
without
the
dma
upgrade
your
computer's
only
half
a
rocket
ship
yeah
but
who
can
afford
the
upgrades
well
you
can
i
get
the
demos
for
free
i
don't
see
why
i
shouldn't
give
'em
to
you
for
the
same
price
any
friend
of
buffy's
what
oh
that's
the
sound
she
makes
when
she's
speechless
with
geeker
joy
can
i
just
say
this
is
the
finest
pizza
ever
on
god's
green
earth
what
is
your
secret
well
after
you
bake
it
you
fry
it
in
herbs
and
olive
oil
but
you
gotta
use
a
castiron
skillet
no
room
for
compromise
there
y'know
you
should
market
these
things
i
mean
you
can
get
two
three
hundred
bucks
apiece
hungry
no
thanks
buffy
i
want
to
apologize
that
wasn't
how
i
wanted
us
to
meet
i
wanted
it
to
be
perfect
i'm
very
fond
of
your
mother
i
guess
that's
pretty
obvious
i
know
you're
the
most
important
thing
in
her
life
and
well
gosh
that
makes
you
pretty
important
to
me
too
buffy
i
really
want
you
to
be
okay
with
this
beg
to
differ
we
really
want
you
to
be
okay
with
this
i'm
okay
you
are
i
am
buffy
ii
believe
he's
he's
um
it
it's
it's
staking
time
really
don't
you
think
any
others
well
for
their
sakes
i
certainly
hope
not
what
i
kill
vampires
that's
my
job
well
true
true
although
you
don't
usually
beat
them
into
quite
such
a
bloody
pulp
beforehand
everything
alright
yeah
fine
i
killed
a
vampire
here
on
wednesday
why
are
they
hanging
out
at
the
park
well
they're
scattered
you
know
now
their
leaders
are
gone
with
any
luck
dead
in
times
of
crisis
they
usually
return
to
the
easiest
feeding
grounds
vampires
are
creeps
yes
that's
why
one
slays
them
i
mean
people
are
perfectly
happy
getting
along
and
then
vampires
come
and
they
run
around
and
they
kill
people
and
they
take
over
your
whole
house
they
start
making
these
stupid
little
mini
pizzas
and
everyone's
like
'i
like
your
mini
pizzas'
but
i'm
telling
you
i
am
uh
uh
buffy
ii
believe
the
subtext
here
is
is
rapidly
becoming
uh
uh
text
are
you
sure
there's
nothing
you
want
to
share
no
forget
it
think
there'll
be
anymore
ii
can
wait
if
you
say
one
more
word
things
will
become
dire
did
you
even
bother
to
taste
'em
nooo
well
i
did
and
i'm
here
to
tell
ya
those
mini
pizzas
have
changed
my
life
ted
is
the
master
chef
fine
so
he's
a
good
cook
well
what
does
that
really
tell
you
about
a
person
everything
you
don't
like
him
i
don't
know
him
i
i
mean
so
far
all
i
see
is
someone
who
apparently
has
a
good
job
seems
nice
and
polite
and
my
mother
really
likes
him
what
kind
of
a
monster
is
he
i'm
just
saying
there's
something
a
little
too
clean
about
this
clown
he's
a
clean
clown
i
have
my
own
fun
buff
you're
lacking
evidence
i
think
maybe
we're
in
sigmund
freud
territory
he
has
a
point
separation
anxiety
the
mother
figure
being
taken
away
conflict
with
the
father
figure
he's
not
my
father
figure
having
issues
much
i
am
not
you're
having
parental
issues
you're
having
parental
issues
xander
what
freud
would've
said
the
exact
same
thing
except
he
might
not
have
done
that
little
dance
okay
i
admit
it's
weird
seeing
my
mother
frenching
a
guy
is
definitely
a
ticket
to
therapy
land
but
it's
more
than
that
i'm
pretty
good
at
sensing
what's
going
on
around
me
and
there
is
definitely
something
wrong
with
this
ted
ted
of
course
ted
who'd
you
think
i
was
talking
about
hi
ted
ted
who's
here
hello
kids
what
are
you
doing
here
i'm
updating
the
software
in
the
guidance
office
which
reminds
me
your
upgrades
oh
what
a
day
thank
you
think
nothing
of
it
buffy
do
you
like
miniature
golf
who
doesn't
well
your
mother
and
i
were
thinking
maybe
this
saturday
we
could
drag
the
three
of
you
out
to
the
course
spend
some
time
swinging
the
iron
with
the
stuffy
old
people
well
uh
i'm
making
a
picnic
basket
with
mini
pizzas
and
cookies
you
know
what
we
we
would
love
to
honestly
but
um
unfortunately
we
have
that
thing
on
saturday
ohhh
that
thing
that
thing
hey
we
can
do
that
thing
anytime
i'm
tired
of
doing
that
thing
we're
on
great
hello
jenny
rupert
hi
some
of
your
uh
textbooks
were
delivered
to
the
library
um
do
you
want
me
to
uh
hang
on
to
them
yeah
that's
fine
i'll
send
the
kids
by
to
pick
'em
up
right
good
pretty
flimsy
excuse
for
coming
by
to
see
me
you
should
have
heard
the
ones
i
threw
out
i
just
i
wanted
to
uh
see
how
you
were
doing
i'm
doing
pretty
good
actually
i've
stayed
out
of
mortal
danger
for
three
whole
weeks
i
could
get
used
to
it
i'm
still
having
trouble
sleeping
though
oh
of
course
um
you
you
you
need
time
or
possibly
space
rupert
i
know
you're
concerned
but
having
you
constantly
poking
around
making
little
puppy
dog
eyes
at
me
wondering
if
i'm
okay
you
make
me
feel
bad
that
i
don't
feel
better
i
don't
want
that
responsibility
sorry
i
certainly
don't
mean
to
make
um
'dog
eyes'
at
you
i'm
just
worried
i
know
i
shouldn't
have
bothered
you
so
mom's
like
'do
you
think
ted
will
like
this'
and
'this
is
ted's
favorite
show'
and
'ted's
teaching
me
computers'
and
'ted
said
the
funniest
thing'
and
i'm
like
'that's
really
great
mom'
and
then
she
said
i
was
being
sarcastic
which
i
was
but
i'm
sorry
if
i
don't
wanna
talk
about
ted
all
the
time
so
you
gonna
talk
about
something
else
at
some
point
i'm
sorry
i
just
have
so
much
to
deal
with
i
don't
need
some
new
guy
in
my
life
no
but
maybe
your
mom
does
well
sure
if
you're
gonna
use
wisdom
loneliness
is
about
the
scariest
thing
there
is
okay
so
my
mom
needs
a
guy
in
her
life
does
it
have
to
be
ted
do
you
have
somebody
else
in
mind
there's
a
guy
out
there
that
would
satisfy
you
my
dad
yeah
okay
that's
not
gonna
happen
fine
fine
i'll
give
ted
a
chance
i'll
play
minigolf
and
i'll
smile
and
curtsy
and
be
the
dutiful
daughter
do
i
have
to
like
him
kiss
me
finally
something
i
wanna
do
ah
the
dreaded
fivepar
cuckoo
clock
ha
so
many
have
come
so
few
have
conquered
that
picnic
was
delicious
you
know
how
rare
it
is
to
find
a
man
that
cooks
i
know
i've
been
looking
a
long
time
for
one
so
buffy
i
bet
the
boys
are
lined
up
around
the
block
tryin'
to
get
a
date
with
you
not
really
oh
they
are
but
she's
only
interested
in
uh
her
studies
'bookcracker
buffy'
it's
kind
of
her
nickname
well
glad
to
hear
it
i
bet
that
means
your
grades
will
be
picking
up
soon
my
grades
how
does
he
know
about
my
grades
i
told
him
he
wants
to
know
everything
about
you
he's
concerned
that's
a
good
thing
ooo
nice
shot
ted
keep
your
eye
on
the
ball
watch
those
elbows
oh
bad
luck
little
lady
oh
we
won't
count
it
we
won't
well
it's
just
miniature
golf
it
is
but
the
rules
are
the
rules
and
what
we
teach
her
is
what
she
takes
out
into
the
world
when
we're
not
there
whether
it's
at
school
or
an
unchaperoned
party
i
don't
mean
to
overstep
my
bounds
this
is
between
you
and
your
mother
i
just
think
right
is
right
he
has
a
point
fine
i'll
just
go
hit
my
ball
from
the
rough
hey
how
'bout
that
got
a
hole
in
two
beg
to
differ
okay
so
fine
my
score
or
whatever
i
think
you're
missing
the
point
here
little
lady
right
is
right
wrong
is
wrong
why
don't
people
see
that
it's
just
a
game
right
it's
just
a
game
do
your
own
thing
well
i'm
not
wired
that
way
and
i
am
here
to
tell
you
it
is
not
a
game
it
does
count
and
i
don't
stand
for
that
kind
of
malarkey
in
my
house
then
i
guess
it's
a
good
thing
i'm
not
in
your
house
do
you
want
me
to
slap
that
smartass
mouth
of
yours
who's
up
for
dessert
i
made
chocolatechip
cookies
yummy
cookies
yeah
ii
made
uh
too
many
so
you
guys
are
gonna
have
to
take
some
home
mm
buffy
you've
got
to
try
one
of
these
they're
really
good
mm
mm
mm
these
are
tasty
good
morning
sunshine
hey
i've
got
juice
i've
got
sticky
buns
oh
don't
they
smell
good
ted
made
them
what
i'd
just
like
to
eat
something
around
here
that
ted
didn't
make
oh
what
kind
of
an
attitude
is
that
look
mom
i
know
you
think
he's
great
and
all
but
i
y'know
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
be
nice
to
you
and
you
couldn't
say
two
words
to
him
on
saturday
i
do
not
expect
you
to
love
him
right
away
like
i
do
but
i
do
expect
you
to
treat
him
decently
you
love
him
ii
don't
know
that
just
slipped
out
but
i
guess
i
mean
it's
not
exactly
like
men
beat
down
the
door
when
you're
a
single
when
you're
a
single
parent
honey
look
i
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
anybody
if
they
didn't
care
about
you
but
he
does
i
don't
understand
why
you
can't
see
that
he
threatened
me
what
he
threatened
me
he
said
that
he
was
gonna
slap
my
face
he
said
no
such
thing
honey
ted
told
me
what
happened
he
caught
you
cheating
didn't
he
yeah
i
kicked
my
ball
in
put
me
in
jail
but
he
totally
wigged
and
he
didn't
say
anything
about
it
in
front
of
the
others
did
he
uh
no
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
well
i
thought
that
that
was
pretty
decent
of
him
ted
said
we
are
just
gonna
have
to
give
you
time
to
come
around
oh
speaking
of
which
he's
making
dinner
for
us

sooo
delicious
what
do
you
mean

him
out

mean
investigate
him

out
his
secrets
hack
into
his
life
can
you
say
'overreaction'
can
you
say
'sucking
chest
wound'
buffy
it
just
seems
like
you
want
him
to
be
corrupt
or
something
the
guy
lost
his
senses
over
minigolf
so
he's
a
little
uptight
last
i

mrs
lawnsdale
it
is
not
an
inexpensive
piece
of
software
as
a
matter
of

a
very
expensive
one

removes
the
risk
of
crashing

joycie
you

get
to
be
salesman

up
after

couple
of
rejections
she'll
come
'round
vampires
here

some
goblin
you

little
diary
psychiatrists
have
a
word
for
something
like
this
delusional
so
from
now
on
you'll
do
what
i
say
when
i
say
or
i
show
this
to
your
mother
and
you'll
spend
your
best
dating
years
behind
the
wall
of
a
mental
institution
your
mother

i
are
going
to
be
happy
you're

course
i
told
them
you
uh
i
man

is
killing
me
that
bastard
was
up

it
if

earlier
this

i
thought
you
liked
him
i
sometimes
like
things
that
are
not
good
for
me
besides
no
way
no
how
does
buffy
put
the
big
hurt
on
an
innocent
man
nice
uncle
ted
was
dirty
we've
gotta
prove
that
somehow
xander
do
you
have
a
pen
if
buffy
has
to
go
to
jail
because
of
that
creep
i'm

violence
a
criminal
record

the
slayer
shouldn't
she
have
what
a
license
to
kill
well
not
for
fun
but
she's
like
this
superman
shouldn't
there
be
different
rules
for
her
sure
in
a
fascist
society
right
why
can't
we
have
one
of
those
buffy's
not
going
to
jail
it's
not
fair
whatever
the
authorities
have
planned
for
her
it
can't
be
much
worse
than
what
she's
doing
to
herself
she's
taken
a
human
life
the
guilt
itit's
it's
pretty
hard
to
bear
and
it
won't
go
away

should
know
since
you
helped
raise
that
demon

up

the
least
i
can
do
is
pick
up
the
slack
someone
has
to
giles
you
shouldn't
go
out
there
without
the
slayer
until
buffy
regains
her
equilibrium
there
is
no
slayer
if
you
need
help
