our
city
of
the
future
i
made
the
hovercars
they're
orangejuice
cans
see
they're
very
nice
but
ii
still
don't
understand
we're
reading
walden
this
is
uh
a
kid's
version
of
a
utopian
society
you'll
notice
there
are
no
schools
but
an
extraordinary
number
of
pizza
parlors
i
don't
think
i
know
of
a
breed
of
humans
this
small
who's
going
to
live
here
ha
ha
ha
oh
god
she's
always
like
this
ha
ha
come
on
wacky
buffy
see
ya
mr
davis
as
you
can
see
we've
provided
the
best
in
progressive
learning
but
we
can't
teach
your
children
unless
you
do
as
parents
you
have
a
responsibility
to
create
the
right
attitude
to
teach
your
child
what
school
can
mean
ms
summers
school
is
where
you
learn
exactly
parents
let
kids
focus
on
school
as
a
social
experience
rather
than
a
learning
experience
we
want
you
to
get
your
kids
just
as
excited
about
education
as
they
are
about
the
lunch
hour
i
helped
make
lunch
today
oh
yes
before
school
peanut
butter
and
jelly
i
don't
eat
but
dawn
takes
one
every
day
tell
me
about
it
my
kid's
been
brownbagging
it
even
though
i
pay
for
the
lunch
program
it's
true
something
has
to
be
done
about
the
quality
of
the
food
anya
this
register
report
for
january
looks
a
bit
off
pull
the
files
again
are
you
mad
at
me
mad

well
then
why
are
you
torturing
me
you
know
i
used
to
punish
people
like
this
when
i
was
a
demon
i
made
them
doublecheck
spreadsheets
for
all
eternity
i'm
sorry
if
you
resent
my
authority
but
i
won't
feel
comfortable
leaving
here
until
i
know
that
absolutely
everything
anya
you're
taking
the
ramadan
effigy
it's
not
inventory
it's
my
personal
collection
oh
huh
aren't
you
mister
dicey
semantics
so
what
you
think
you
can
just
take
anything
you
want
give
it
no
you
give
it
ow
ow
ow
okay
when
i'm
marveling
at
the
immaturity

be
scared
anya
giles
is
gonna
leave
the
store
to
you
when
he
goes
what
more
do
you
want
i'm
not
leaving
the
store
to
anyone
i'm
going
to
england
i'm
not
dead
i'm
still
a
partner
silent
oversees
partner
who
you
should
be
very
nice
to
unless
you
want
to
end
up
working
at
video
hut
what
are
you
doing
what
kind
of
gratitude
is
that
i
know
i
know
it's
just
he
keeps
saying
he's
going
and
then
he
doesn't
and
i
keep
almost
being
in
charge
but
then
i'm
not
and
maybe
he
shouldn't
be
going
at
all
but
we
can't
talk
about
that
and
it
all
just
leaves
me
with
this
stress
and
bossiness
stored
up
and
it
just
leaks
out
just
give
it
time
ahn
this
is
hard
for
all
of
us
just
be
patient
i
was
being
patient
but
it
took
too
long
i
mean
ii
miss
buffy
i
do
but
life
shouldn't
just
stop
because
she's
gone
i'm
sick
of
waiting
to
take
over
here
and
i'm
sick
of
waiting
to
tell
everyone
about
us
we've
talked
about
this
we
can't
announce
our
engagement
while
things
are
so
up
in
the
air
why
not
it's
happy
news
happy
news
in
hard
times
is
a
good
thing
it
is
but
if
things
go
as
planned
everything
could
be
different
let's
just
hold
on
you've
been
saying
that
all
summer
please
anya
we'll
know
more
after
we
talk
to
willow
and
tara
tonight
fine
whatever
just
remember
that
this
whole
marriage
thing
was
your
stupid
idea
i
didn't
ask
to
be
all
crazy
so
my
homeroom
teacher
ms
lefcort
was
like
your
sister's
an
example
to
us
all
hmm
she
wanted
to
make
it
national
buffy
day
makes
sense
it
does
yeah
she
responded
to
buffybot
because
a
robot
is
predictable
boring
perfect
teacher's
pet
that's
all
schools
are
you
know
just
factories
spewing
out
mindless
little
automatons
who
go
on
to
be
very
valuable
and
productive
members
of
society
and
you
should
go
because
buffy
would
want
you
to
check
one
mindless
automaton
coming
up
so
uh
what
do
you
fancy
bit
uh
game
of
rummy
well
uh
willow
and
tara
said
they'd
be
back
early
you
don't
really
have
to
hang
i
mean
if
you're
bored
i'm
not
and
yeah
i
do
but
i'm
fine
alone
it's
not
like
anyone's
coming
after
me
i'm
not
the
key
or
if
i
am
i
don't
open
anything
any
more
it's
over
remember
i'm
not
leaving
you
here
by
yourself
so
forget
it
well
i'm
just
saying
spike
slams
the
cards
down
hard
on
the
table
dawn
jumps
no
i'm
not
leaving
you
to
get
hurt
not
again
now

be
scared
i'm
going
to
kill
him
slayer

practically
impossible
to

but
it's
what
we

changing
your
minds
willow

changing
their
minds
period
excuse
me
who
made
you
the
boss
of
the
group
you
did
you
said
willow
should
be
boss
and
then
you
said
let's
vote
and
it
was
unanimous
and
then
you
made
her
this
little
plaque
that
said
boss
of
us
you
put
little
sparkles
on
it
valid
points
all
but
we
i
mean
we
were
just
talking
then
xander
i
can
do
this
i
promise
but
not
without
you
should
we
maybe
tell
giles
you

now
that
we're
really
ready
it's
not
like
he's
going
anywhere
ever
no
no
one
else

know
not
giles
not
spike
not
dawn
they
might
not
understand
what
if
something
does
go
wrong
i'm
telling
you
it
won't
scenario
we
raise
buffy
from
the
grave

tries
to
eat
our
brains

we
a
congratulate
ourselves
on
a
job
well
done
willow
xander
this
isn't
zombies
zombies
don't
eat
brains
anyway
unless
instructed
to
by
their
zombie
masters
a
lot
of
people
get
that
wrong
this
isn't
like
dawn
trying
to
bring
mrs
summers
back
or
anything
we've
dealt
with
before
buffy
didn't
die
a
natural
death
she
was
killed
by
mystical
energy
which
means
we
do
have
a
shot
it
means
more
than
that
it
means
we
don't
know
where
she
really
is
we
saw
her
body
will
we
buried
it
her
body
yeah
but
her
soul
her
essence
i
mean
that
could
be
somewhere
else
she
could
be
trapped
inin
some
sort
of
hell
dimension
like
angel
was
suffering
eternal
torment
just
because
she
saved
us
and
i'm
not
gonna
let
i'm
not
gonna
leave
her
there
it's
buffy
what
time
do
we
meet
willow
what
happened
where's
dawn
upstairs
in
bed
but
the
bot
here
seems
to
have
got
into
a
scrape
while
she
was
on
patrol
i
think
my
feet
are
broken
eh
looks
more
like
a
short
in
the
navigational
system
can
you
get
me
a
flashlight
it's
in
the
uh
kitchen
she
wanted
to
go
out
and
look
for
you
again
but
i
figured
there
are
enough
things
in
sunnydale
that
go
bump
in
the
night
good
thinking
but
my
homing
device
locates
you
when
i
am
injured
i
am
programmed
to
go
to
you
right
i
know
still
i
think
just
this
once
it
was
a
good
idea
to
stay
put
spike
was
right
sorry
i
questioned
you
spike
you
know
i
admire
your
brain
almost
as
much
as
your
washboard
abs
i
told
you
to
make
her
stop
doing
that
i
did
i
mean
i
thought
i
got
all
that
stuff
out
of
the
program
well
you've
got
her
opened
up
fix
it
sure
i
mean
i
have
a
lot
of
work
here
but
i'll
see
what
i
can
do
can
you
shine
the
flashlight
right
here
spike
did
i
say
something
wrong
no
it's
not
your
fault
i
think
spike
stopped
liking
me
that's
not
true
hehe
thinks
you're
swell
then
how
come
he
never
looks
at
me
any
more
even
when
he's
talking
to
me
he
just
gets
cranky
the
way
vampires
do
now
just
relax
i
am
gonna
make
you
good
as
new
i
promise
that
was
splendid
now
try
it
again

only
this
time
remember
your
breathing
no
uh
that's
good
but
uh

think
of
the
breath
as
chi
air
as
a
a
life
source
i
don't
require
oxygen
to
live
of
course
strictly
speaking
but
anya
um

maybe
you
should
stick
to
the
standard
drill
you
know
you
don't
want
her
to
blow
another
gasket
i'm
testing
her
responses
after
her
injury
i
see
no
harm
in
imparting
a
little
eastern
philosophy
well
i
just
think
that
the
concept
of
chi
might
be
a
little
you
know
hard
for
her
to
grasp
you
know
she's
not
the
descendant
of
a
long
line
of
mystical
warriors
she's
the
descendant
of
a
toaster
oven
yes
well
i
appreciate
your
input
anya
but
i
think
buffybot
has
responded
nicely
to
our
sessions
well
you're
the
boss
still
would
you
like
to
test
me
again
no
perhaps
we
should
call
it
a
day
your
your
responses
are
fine
perhaps
anya's
right
perhaps
i
am
trying
to
teach
you
as
if
you
were
human
yes
i
like
your
teachings
every
slayer
needs
her
watcher
i'm
not
so
sure
about
that
what
do
you
mean
nothing
i
just
can't
help
but
wonder
if
she
would
have
been
better
off
without
me
buffy
i
don't
think
that's
true
you
were
very
helpful
to
her
right
yes
i
was
a
perfect
watcher
i
did
what
any
good
watcher
would
do
got
my
slayer
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
oh
that
wasn't
your
fault
of
course
not
that's
how
all
slayerwatcher
relationships
end
isn't
it
she's
gone
i
did
my
job
well
then
why
are
you
still
here
so
i
got
her
cornered
in
this
alley
see
you
get
the
slayer
cornered
yeah
i
figured
it's
my
duty
she's
a
menace
to
our
society
so
we
fight
and
i'm
like
pow
pow
pow
and
i
got
her
on
the
ropes
you're
lying
to
me
i
swear
on
all
that's
unholy
you
haven't
even
heard
the
best
part
i
cut
her
right
and
she's
i
don't
know
some
kind
of
machine
she's
not
human
you're
high
i'm
tellin'
you
it
wasn't
even
the
slayer
man
it
was
like
a
trick
a
robot
what's
with
the
blood
rat
talk
okay
uh
so
i
was
over
in
sunnydale
minding
my
own
beeswax
when
i
see
the
slayer
mag
the
part
about
the
robot
we
fought
right
and
i
was
like
all
over
her
boom
boom
boom
he
says
the
slayer's
been
replaced
by
some
kind
of
machine
a
robot
yeah
and
i
kicked
her
synthetic
ass
you
shoulda
seen
the
sparks
razor
gets
up
towers
over
the
vamp
you
tellin'
me
there's
no
slayer
in
sunnydale
that's
what
i'm
saying
they
got
some
kind
of
decoy
standing
in
for
her
town
is
wide
open
nowhere
like
the
hellmouth
for
a
party
there's
all
kinds
of
bad
in
that
place
i
guess
with
your
muscle
uh
you
could
own
it
in
no
time
hey
look
i
know
you
guys
don't
usually
let
vampires
join
the
gang
and
i
got
the
whole
sunlight

was
thinking
you
know
as
thanks
for
the
411
you
could
let
me

the
neck
