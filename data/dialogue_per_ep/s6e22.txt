relevant
here
you
called
me
a
rank
arrogant
amateur

rupert
'cause
i've
turned
pro
asmodea
bring
forth
giles
vincire
what
no
get
off
solvo
libero
what
did
you
do
contained
her
and
her
powers
within
a
binding
field
it
puts
her
in
a
kind
of
stasis
for
the
time
giles
looks
at
buffy
for
the
first
time
pauses
buffy
continues
staring
at
willow
you
cut
your
hair
i'm
blonde
i
i
colored
my
hair
again
i'm
blonde
yes
i
noticed
i'm
very
sorry
about
tara
this
won't
hold
me
forever
i
came
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
council
the
council
haven't
a
clue
about
much
of
anything
really
no
there's
an
an
extremely
powerful
coven
in
devon
they
sensed
the
rise
of
a
dangerous
magical
force
here
in
sunnydale
a
dark
force
fueled
by
grief
willow
i'd
so
hoped
it
wasn't
her
and
then
a
seer
in
the
coven
told
me
about
tara
that's
when
the
coven
imbued
me
with
their
powers
and
sent
you
here
to
bring
willow
down
buffy
what's
happened
here
god
i
don't
even
know
where
to
start
well
willow's
clearly
been
abusing
the
magicks
she
has
she
was
and
i
barely
even
noticed
giles
everything's
just
been
so
xander
left
anya
at
the
altar
and
anya's
a
vengeance
demon
again
dawn's
a
total
klepto
money's
been
so
tight
that
i've
been
slinging
burgers
at
the
doublemeat
palace

and
i've
been
sleeping
with
spike
sorry
anya
willow
i
need
you
anya
i
need
you
to
do
something
for
me
i
know
what
you're
trying
to
do
and
i
hate
to
burst
your
bubble
but
that
mind
control
mojo
doesn't
work
on
vengeance
demons
so
why
don't
you
just
willow
stop
talking
and
listen
okay
ou
need
to
free
me
no
you
don't
want
to
call
out
to
them
you
want
to
take
away
this
binding
spell
i
don't
know
how
i
do
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
duct
tape
on
their
mouths
so
the
demon
could
eat
them
because
they
were
figments
all
of
it
you
sunnydale
and
i
was
just
some
nutcase
in
la
of
course
why
didn't
we
see
it
before
for
what
i
should
never
have
left
no
you
were
right
to
leave
we're
just
stupid
i
know
you're
all
stupid
i
should
never
have
abandoned
you
no
giles
you
were
right
about
everything
it
is
time
i
was
an
adult
sometimes
the
most
adult
thing
you
can
do
is
ask
for
help
when
you
need
it
now
you
tell
me
i
guess
i
wasn't
ready
before
it
took
a
long
time
for
that
feeling
to
go
away
the
feeling
that
i
wasn't
really
here
it
was
like
when
i
clawed
my
way
out
of
that
grave
i
left
something
behind
part
of
me
i
just
i
don't
understand
why
i'm
back
you
have
a
calling
but
it
was
my
time
giles
someone
would
have
taken
my
place
so
why
right
what's
gonna
happen
to
willow
well
the
coven
is
working
on
a
way
to
extract
her
powers
without
killing
her
and
uh
should
she
survive
you
ought
to
know
buffy
that
there's
no
guarantee
she'll
be
as
she
was
willow
has
killed
a
human
being
how
will
she
be
able
to
live
with
herself
i
wouldn't
worry
about
that
willow
doesn't
live
here
anymore
vincire
solutum
fool
me
once
willow
shame
on
you
excudo
where
are
we
going
i
have
no
idea
what
i
don't
know
okay
i
can't
even
run
away
well
and
that's
something
i'm
usually
good
at
maybe
we
should
we
go
back
and
help
yeah
'cause
i've
been
such
a
big
help
already
standing
around
like
a
monkey
while
buffy
gets
shot
tara's
dead
and
willow
losing
well
feeling
sorry
for
yourself
isn't
helping
either
xander
okay
you
know
if
spike
were
here
he'd
go
back
and
fight
sure
if
he
wasn't
too
busy
trying
to
rape
your
sister
what
forget
it
i
don't
believe
you
fine
he
wouldn't
do
that
is
this
blind
spot
like
a
genetic
trait
with
the
summers
women
the
only
useful
thing
spike
ever
did
was
finally
leave
town
well
that
was
a
bloody
doddle
and
piece
o'piss
got
any
more
ruddy
tests
for
me
you
ponce
i'll
take
anything
you
can
throw
at
me
if
it'll
get
me
what
i
need
to
take
care
of
the
slayer
give
her
what's
coming
to
her
so
you
just
bring
it
on
bring
on
the
whole
he
pauses
looks
confused
weird
skittering
noises
bloody
hell
that
all
you
got
jeeves
'cause
i
could
stand
to
go
another
ten
rounds
whereas
you
can
barely
stand
your
powers
may
be
undeniably
greater
but
i
can
still
hurt
you
if
i
have
to
boy
you
just
don't
get
it
do
you
nothing
can
hurt
me
now
this
is
nothing
it's
all
nothing
i
see
if
you
lose
someone
you
love
the
other
people
in
your
life
who
care
about
you
become
meaningless
i
wonder
what
tara
would
say
about
that
you
can
ask
her
yourself
you're
always
saving
everyone
it's
kinda
pesky
you
probably
even
think
you're
buying
escape
time
for
jonathan
and
the
other
one
well
i
got
a
little
secret
for
ya
i
can
kill
them
from
anywhere
i
want
with
this
it'll
find
them
it'll
bury
them
along
with
anyone
helping
those
dead
men
walking
don't
unless
somebody
somehow
can
get
there
in
time
to
save
them
huh
oh
well
fly
my
pretty
fly
see
what
i
did
there
go
good
luck
thought
she'd
never
leave
now
i
finally
have
you
all
to
myself
you're
such
a
hypocrite
waltzing
in
here
with
your
borrowed
magicks
so
you
can
tell
me
what
magic's
bad
behave
be
a
good
girl
well
i
i
don't
think
you're
in
any
position
to
be
telling
me
what
to
do
do
you
i
used
to
think
you
had
all
the
answers
that
i
had
so
much
to
learn
from
you
willow
you
were
jealous
still
are
just
couldn't
bear
that
i
was
the
one
with
power
that's
why
you
ran
away
incurso
that's
why
you
she
stumbles
backward
from
the
magic
blow
and
giles
falls
to
the
floor
again
that
was
rude
now
i
forgot
what
i
was
saying
perhaps
you're
not
as
strong
as
you
think
you
are
you're
expending
way
too
much
of
your
mystical
energy
to
maintain
your
powers
at
this
rate
you're
going
to
burn
out
and
up
blah
blah
blah
willow
you
you
need
to
stop
what
i
need
is
a
little
pickmeup

you
doing
if
we
can
pull
these
out
we
can
use

coffins
for
height
maybe
get
out
of
here
maybe
one
of
the
tunnels
spike
uses
is
around
here
uh
we
could
use
it
to
get
to
his
place
that's
the
last
place
on
earth
we
need
to
be
oh
but
it
was
good
enough
for
you
to
take
me
there
after
what
he
did
to
you
what
he
tried
to
do
whatever
xander
so
it's
true

what
i'm
chosen
to
protect
awaken
sister
of
the
dark
awaken
cut

to
the
bluff
willow

to
her
right
as
if
she
can
hear
buffy
i
have
to
stop
her

the
slayer
right
to
the
last
willow
and
it
is
the
last
you

for
all
your
fighting
thinking

saving
the
world
buffy
and
in
the
end
i'm
the
only
one
that
can
save
it
by
killing
us

the
only
way
to
stop
the
pain

buffy
you're
a
warrior
you
won't
go
out

lot
for

good
of
you
to
teleport
all
this
way
though
in
retrospect
it
probably
would
have
been
better
if
you
hadn't
come
and
given
willow
all
that
magic
that
made
her
like
ten
times
more
powerful
that
would
have
been
a
plus

of
here
ah
no
you're
not
the
only
one
with
