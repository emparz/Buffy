he
to
her
who
the
girl

thing

no
idea

store
this
can't

on
drusilla
it's
gotta
end
oh
no
my
pet
this
is
just
the
beginning
it's
a
secret
what
kind
of
a
secret
uh
the
kind
that's
secret
you
know
where
i
don't
actually
tell
you
what
it
is
i
think
it's
customary
that
when
two
people
are
going
out
on
an
evening
that
they
they
both
have
an
idea
of
where
they're
going
oh
come
on
where
is
your
sense
of
adventure
well
i
i
uh
how
will
i
know
what
to
wear
do
you
own
anything
else
uh
wwell
not
as
such
no
um
rupert
you're
gonna
have
to
trust
me
alright
alright
i
pput
myself
in
your
hands
that
sounds
like
fun
okay
tomorrow
night
730
right
yes
hey
hello
um
did
we
hunt
last
night
i
did
a
couple
quick
sweeps
downtown
any
encounters
nothing
vampirey
uh
i've
been
researching
your
friend
spike
uh
the
profile
is
fairly
unappetizing
but
ii
still
haven't
got
a
bead
on
why
he's
here
you'll
figure
it
out
you
alright
you
seem
a
little
glum
i'm
fine
why
don't
you
take
the
night
off
okay
that'd
be
nice
yes
you
could
spend
some
time
with
angel
i
don't
know
he
might
have
other
plans
do
you
know
who
she
was
well
it
seems
like
louis
xvi
was
just
sort
of
a
weak
king
that's
fair
enough
uh
any
other
impressions
i
just
don't
see
why
everyone's
always
picking
on
marie
antoinette
i
can
so
relate
to
her
she
worked
really
hard
to
look
that
good
and
people
just
don't
appreciate
that
kind
of
effort
no
dark
hair
old
dress
pretty
cordelia
and
i
know
the
peasants
were
all
depressed
i
think
you
mean
'oppressed'
whatever
they
were
cranky
so
they're
like
'let's
lose
some
heads'
uhhh
that's
fair
and
and
marie
antoinette
cared
about
them
she
was
gonna
let
them
have
cake
yes
well
that's
a
very
interesting
perspective
um
would
anyone
else
like
to
comment
vampire
i
don't
know
i
don't
think
so
they
seemed
pretty
friendly
who's
friendly
no
one
angel
and
a
girl
willow
do
we
have
to
be
in
total
share
mode
hey
it's
me
if
angel's
doing
somethin'
wrong
i
wanna
know
'cause
it
gives
me
a
happy
mm
i'm
glad
someone
has
a
happy
aw
you
just
need
cheering
up
and
i
know
just
the
thing
crazed
dance
party
at
the
bronze
i
dunno
very
calm
dance
party
at
the
bronze
moping

him
he
knew
oh
uh
right
then

thing
called

i'll
try
not
to
have
a
crisis
and
on
your
right
once
again
the
beautiful
campus
i
think
you've
now
seen
everything
there
is
to
see
in
sunnydale
well
it's
really
feel
free
to
say
dull
okay
dull's
good
or
maybe
not
so
dull
is
that
more
vampires
must
be
the
weather
stay
close
to
me
maybe
they
were
just
passing
through
i
don't
think
so
you've
got
one
chance
to
live
tell
me
what
i
wanna
know
and
i'll
let
you
go
where's
the
other
one
i
killed
her
i
i
killed
her
and
she
just
turned
to
dust
it
was
amazing
the
only
thing
i
could
track
down
was
this
address
the
sunset
club
still
didn't
find
anything
incriminating
he
leaves
no
paper
trail
no
records
that's
incriminating
enough
yeah
i'm
gonna
have
to
go
with
dead
boy
on
this
one
could
you
not
call
me
that
we're
friends
of
ford's
boy
we
blend
right
in
in
no
way
do
we
stick
out
like
sore
thumbs
let's
look
around
you
guys
check
out
downstairs
sure
thing
bossy
the
cow
okay
but
do
they
really
stick
out
what
sore
thumbs
do
they
stick
out
i
mean
have
you
ever
seen
a
thumb
and
gone
'wow
that
baby
is
sore'
xander
you
have
too
many
thoughts
the
one
hungry
life
my
life
with
the
other
hi
are
you
probably
noticing
a
theme
here
as
in
'vampires
yay'
that's
the
one
you
guys
are
newbies
i
can
tell
oh
no
we
come
here
all
the
time
don't
be
ashamed
it's
cool
that
you're
open
to
it
we
welcome
anyone
who's
interested
in
the
lonely
ones
the
lonely
ones
vampires
oh
we
usually
call
them
the
nasty
pointy
bitey
ones
so
many
people
have
that
misconception
but
they
who
walk
with
the
night
are
not
interested
in
harming
anyone
they
are
creatures
above
us
exalted
you're
a
fool
you
don't
have
to
be
so
confrontational
about
it
other
viewpoints
than
yours
may
be
valid
you
know
nice
meeting
you
you
really
are
a
people
person
now
nobody's
gonna
talk
to
us
i've
seen
enough
i've
seen
this
type
before
i
mean
they're
children
making
up
bedtime
stories
of
friendly
vampires
to
comfort
themselves
in
the
dark
is
that
so
bad
i
mean
the
dark
can
get
pretty
dark
sometimes
you
need
a
story
these
people
don't
know
anything
about
vampires
what
they
are
how
they
live
how
they
dress
you
know
i
love
a
good
diatribe
but
i'm
still
curious
why
ford
the
bestest
friend
of
the
slayer
is
hanging
with
a
bunch
of
vampire
wannabes
something's
up
with
him
you're
right
about
that
are
you
okay
sorry
to
beep
you
guys
in
the
middle
of
stuff
but
it
seemed
really
weird
no
you
did
the
right
thing
absolutely
you
hated
it
that
much
no
but
but
uh
vampires
on
campus
is
could
have
implications
very
very
grave
you
coulda
just
said
something
uh
honestly
i
i've
always
i've
always
been
interested
in
in
uh
monster
trucks
you
took
him
to
monster
trucks
i
thought
it
would
be
a
change
it
was
a
change
look
we
could've
just
left
whawhat
and
miss
the
nitroburning
funny
cars
no
couldn't
have
that
okay
can
we
get
back
on
the
vampire
tip
here
these
guys
were
here
with
a
purpose
yes
yes
and
uh
we
must
uh
ascertain
what
that
purpose
is
where's
your
friend
i
sent
him
home
oh
uh
good
yes
the
less
he's
involved
in
all
this
the
safer
he'll
be
he
did
bag
a
vamp
his
first
time
out
gotta
give
him
credit
for

him
down
on
the
computer
willow

found
this
address
we
checked
it
out
with
xander
and
it
turned
out
and
xander
wow
everybody's
in
it's
like
a
great
big
exciting
conspiracy
what
are
you
talking
about
i'm
talking
about
the
people
i
trust
who's
drusilla
and
don't
lie
to
me
i'm
tired
of
it
some
lies
are
necessary
for
what
sometimes
the
truth
is
worse
you
live
long
enough
you
find
that
out
i
can
take
it
i
can
take
the
truth
do
you
love
me
what
do
you
i
love
you
i
don't
know
if
i
trust
you
maybe
you
shouldn't
do
either
maybe
i'm
the
one
who
should
decide
i
did
a
lot
of
unconscionable
things
when
i
became
a
vampire
drusilla
was
the
worst
she
was
an
obsession
of
mine
she
was
pure
and
sweet
and
chaste
and
you
made
her
a
vampire
first
i
made
her
insane
killed
everybody
she
loved
visited
every
mental
torture
on
her
i
could
devise
she
eventually
fled
to
a
convent
and
on
the
day
she
took
her
holy
orders
i
turned
her
into
a
demon
well
i
asked
for
the
truth
ford's
part
of
some
society
that
reveres
vampires
practically
worships
them
i
don't
know
what
he
wants
from
you
but
you
can't
trust
him

one
of
them
you
wanna
be
a
vampire

going
to
you

a
little
picky
about
who
they

offer
them
a
trade

chatty
you
were
gonna

i'd
figure
it
out
actually
i
was
counting
on
it
what's
supposed
to
happen
tonight
this
is
so
cool
it's
just
like
it
played
in
my
head
you
know
that
part
where
you
ask
me
what's
supposed
to
happen
it's
already
happening
rigged
up
special
once
it's
closed
it
can
only
be
opened
from
the
outside
as
soon
as
the
sun
sets
they'll
be
comin'
ford
if
these
people
are
still
around
when
they
get
here
we'll
be
changed
all
of
us
we're
going
to
ascend
to
a
new
level
of
consciousness
this
is
the
end
buffy
no
one
gets
outta
here
alive
there's
gotta
be
another
way
out
of
here

is
a
bomb
shelter
buffy
i
knew
i
wasn't
gonna
be
able
to
overpower
you
but
this
is
three
feet
of
solid
concrete
trust
me
when
i
say
we're
in
for
the
long
haul
at
least
let
the
other
people
go
why
are
you
fighting
this
it's
what
we
want
it's
our
chance
for
immortality
this
is
a
beautiful
day
can't
you
see
that
what
i
see
is
that
right
after
the
sun
goes
down
spike
and
all
of
his
friends
are
going
to
be
pigging
out
at
the
allyoucaneat
moron
bar
okay
that's
it
i
think
we
should
gag
her
i
think
you
should
try
she's
an
unbeliever
she
taints
us
i
am
trying
to
save
you
you
are
playing
in
some
serious
traffic
here
do
you
understand
that
you're
going
to
die
and
the
only
hope
you
have
of
surviving
this
is
to
get
out
of
this
pit
right
now
and
my
god
could
you
have
a
dorkier
outfit
i
gotta
back
her
up
d
you
look
like
a
big
ninny
627
sunset
when
we
get
there
everybody
spread
out
two
men
on
the
door
first
priority's
the
slayer
everything
else
is
fair
game
and
let's
remember
to
share
people
are
you
sure
you're
up
for
this
i
want
a
treat
i
need
a
treat
and
a
special
one
you'll
have
lucius
bring
the
car
around
hey
you
never
give
up
do
you
no
i
don't
that's
a
good
quality
in
a
person
too
many
people
they
just
lay
back
and
take
it
but
us
us
we
have
something
in
common
now
more
than
you
think
yeah
well
let
me
explain
something
to
you
you're
what
we
call
the
bad
guy
i
guess
i
am
these
people
aren't
gonna
get
changed
are
they
the
rest
of
them
they're
just
fodder
technically
yes
but
i'm
in
i
will
become
immortal
well
i've
got
a
news
flash
for
you
braintrust
that's
not
how
it
works
you
die
and
a
demon
sets
up
shop
in
your
old
house
and
it
walks
and
it
talks
and
it
remembers
your
life
but
it's
not
you
it's
better
than
nothing
and
your
life
is
nothing
ford
these
people
don't
deserve
to
die
well
neither
do
i
but
apparently
no
one
took
that
into
consideration
'cause
i'm
still
dying
i
look
good
don't
i
well
let
me
tell
you
something
i've
got
maybe
six
months
left
and
by
then
what
they
bury
won't
even
look
like
me
it'll
be
bald
and
shriveled
and
it'll
smell
bad
no
i'm
not
going
out
that
way
i'm
sorry
summers
did
i
screw
up
your
righteous
anger
riff
i'm
sorry
i
had
no
idea
but
what
you're
doing
is
still
very
wrong
okay
well
you
try
vomiting
for
twentyfour
hours
straight
because
the
pain
in
your
head
is
so
intense
and
then
we'll
discuss
the
concept
of
right
and
wrong
these
people
are
sheep
they
wanna
be
vampires
'cause
they're
lonely
miserable
or
bored
i
don't
have
a
choice
you
have
a
choice
you
don't
have
a
good
choice
but
you
have
a
choice
you're
opting
for
mass
murder
here
and
nothing
you
say
is
gonna
make
that
okay
you
think
i
need
to
justify
myself
to
you
i
think
this
is
all
part
of
your
little
fantasy
drama
isn't
this
exactly
how
you
imagined
it
you
tell
me
how
you've
suffered
and
i
feel
sorry
for
you
well
i
do
feel
sorry
for
you
and
if
those
vampires
come
in
here
and
start
feeding
i'll
kill
you
myself
you
know
what
summers
i
really
did
miss
you
ford
help
me
stop
this
please
people
listen
to
me
this
is
not
the
mothership
people
this
is
ugly
death
come
to
play
take
them
all
save
the
slayer
for
me
spike
everybody
stop
good
idea
now
you
let
everyone
out
or
your
girlfriend
fits
in
an
ashtray
spike
it's
gonna
be
alright
baby
let
them
go
down
the
stairs
uh
where's
the
doorknob
you
guys
are
just
in
time
are
there
vampires
they're
contained
they'll
get
out
eventually
though
we
should
probably
go
we
can
come
back
when
they're
gone
come
back
for
what
for
the
body
what
happened
we're
stuck
in
a
basement
buffy
