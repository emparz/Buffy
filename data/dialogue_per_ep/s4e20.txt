and
the
men
these
are
exceptional
boys
their
capture
ratio
just
keeps
increasing
they're
keeping
it
together
morale's
a
problem
the
death
of
professor
walsh
the
escape
of
the
prototype
controlling
the
hsts
is
getting
harder
we
have
serious
overcrowding
in
the
containment
areas
quite
a
mess
it's
not
my
mess
sir
i'm
just
holding
the
fort
while
you
figure
out
what
you
want
to
do
with
the
place
this
incident
with
finn
was
unfortunate
fell
in
with
a
bad
crowd
quite
frankly
i
don't
think
he
was
ever
the
soldier
that
you
all
hoped
he
was
boy
thinks
too
much
nevertheless
we
want
him
back
the
government's
invested
a
sub
we'll
catch
up
to
him
my
feeling
is
he
won't
stray
too
far
from
the
girl
yes
uh
buffy
summers
our
data
banks
don't
have
much
on
her
she's
just
a
girl
she's
a
lot
more
than
that
the
slayer's
dangerous
is
all
i'm
saying
yes
she
makes
things
interesting
no
see
you're
not
getting
it
mr
bits
you're
gonna
be
interestingly
dead
little
miss
tiny's
got
a
habit
of
bollixing
up
the
plans
of
every
wouldbe
unstoppable
badass
who
sets
foot
in
this
town
just
want
you
to
know
when
the
big
ugly
goes
down
the
slayer's
gonna
be
right
in
the
thick
of
it
you
ready
for
that
i'm
counting
on
it
two
slayers
that's
right
and
you
killed
them
both
yeah
i
killed
the
hell
out
of
them
yet
you
fear
this
one
hey
watch
it
mate
i
don't
fear
anything
just
know
my
enemies
do
you
then
why
haven't
you
killed
this
slayer
yet
because
stinking
rotten
luck
is
why
on
top
of
that
now
i
got
this
buggering
chip
up
my
head
yes
your
behavior
modification
circuitry
i
know
what
you
feel
not
likely
you
feel
smothered
trapped
like
an
animal
pure
in
its
ferocity
unable
to
actualize
the
urges
within
clinging
to
one
truth
like
a
flame
struggling
to
burn
within
an
enclosed
glass
that
a
beast
this
powerful
cannot
be
contained
inevitably
it
will
break
free
and
savage
the
land
again
i
will
make
you
whole
again
make
you
savage
wow
i
mean
yeah
i
get
why
the
demons
all
fall
in
line
with
you
you're
like
tony
robbins
if
he
was
a
big
scary
frankenstein
looking
you're
exactly
like
tony
robbins
i
will
restore
you
to
what
you
once
were
when
i
have
the
slayer
how
and
where
i
want
her
easier
said
she's
crafty
her
and
her
little
friends
friends
there's
your
what
do
you
call
it
variable
the
slayer's
got
pals
you
want
her
evening
the
odds
in
a
fight
you
don't
want
the
slayerettes
mucking
about
take
them
away
from
her
now
there's
a
plan
she's
working
solo
she
won't
have
a
chance
to
come
after
us
when
the
wild
rumpus
begins
plus
it
will
make
her
miserable
and
i
never
get
tired
of
that
yeah
leave
'em
to
me
you
can't
hurt
them
what
can
you
do
to
make
sure
they're
out
of
the
picture
not
a
blessed
thing
they're
gonna
do
it
for
me
do
you
know
if
she's
back
yet
la
woman
haven't
heard
from
her
she'll
probably
come
here
first
thing
though
hey
who's
your
buddy
so
you
don't
have
to
be
gi
joe
while
your
civvies
are
getting
washed
try
those
on
you'll
feel
like
a
new
man
would
this
man
have
a
bright
red
nose
and
big
floppy
feet
hey
i'm
sorry
that's
the
cabin
fever
talking
but
as
postapocalypsesplendor
goes
i've
done
wonders
with
the
place
yeah
still
the
sooner
buffy
gets
back
the
better
i'll
feel
you
and
me
both
big
guy
i
take
it
you're
not
an
angel
fan
either
well
it's
not
like
i
hate
the
guy
just
you
know
the
guts
part
of
him
can't
blame
you
but
to
be
fair
it's
not
him
you
hate
it's
the
curse
right
what
did
buffy
tell
you
on
angel
everything
more
than
i
wanted
to
know
sometimes
she
loved
him
he
turned
evil
he
uh
killed
people
she
cured
him
he
left
interesting
little
curse
one
moment's
happiness
what
do
you
mean
you
know
it's
his
trigger
angel's
an
okay
guy
if
he's
mopey
and
sad
and
brooding
but
if
you
give
him
even
one
second
of
pure
real
pleasure
and
that
sets
him
off
only
in
the
big
ol
kill
your
friends
kind
of
way
and
you
know
what
makes
angel
happiest
i'll
give
you
a
hint
it
not
creme
brulee
buffy
sex
with
buffy
she
kind
of
left
that
part
out
huh
yeah
she
did
that
explains
a
lot
of
things
that
i
wish
weren't
explained
hey
man
that's
all
ancient
history
she
went
running
to
la
to
bone
up
on
her
history
no
i'm
sure
it's
boneless
she
just
needs
to
make
sure
everything's
okay
she's
probably
back
already
maybe
you'll
feel
a
lot
better
when
you
see
her
i
guess
we'll
see
if
i
leave
here
tomorrow

would
you
still
remember
me

well
i
must
be
traveling
on
now
there's
too
many
places
i've
got
to
see

and
if
i
stay
here
with
you
girl
things
just
couldn't
be
the
same

'cause
i'm
as
free
as
bird
now
you
know
for
someone
who's
got
watcher
on
his
resume'
you
might
want
to
cast
an
eye
to
the
front
door
every
now
and
again
what
do
you
want
ah
knew
i
left
one
buffy
around
why
i
need
to
speak
to
the
lady
of
the
house
hey
be
a
pet
and
give
her
a
message
for
me
would
you
tell
her
i
just
might
have
something
she
just
might
want
and
what
might
that
something
be
information
highly
classified
not
cheap
wordonthestreet
prattle
either
i'm
talking
about
the
good
stuff
now
thrill
me
it's
nothing
i
know
what
you
think
i'd
come
running
over
saying
i've
got
a
secret
beat
me
till
i
talk
there's
files
in
the
initiative
i'm
pretty
sure
i
know
where
files
yeah
secrets
mission
statements
design
schematics
all
of
maggie
walsh's
dirty
laundry
which
i
guess
would
include
lots
of
tidbits
about
adam
well
yeah
say
someone
were
to
risk
his
life
and
limb
well
limb
anyway
to
obtain
said
files
it
might
be
worth
a
little
something
aat
this
point
a
cynical
person
might
think
that
you're
offering
just
what
we
need
when
we
need
it
most
that
person'd
be
right
rupert
supply
and
demand
and
it
won't
be
cheap
this
time
what
do
you
want
hmm
year
supply
of
blood
guaranteed
protection
merry
bushels
of
cash
and
most
important
a
guarantee
that
i'm
not
to
be
in
anyway
slain
done
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
from
you
sorry
not
close
to
good
enough
this
deal's
with
the
slayer
i'll
tell
her
oh
you'll
tell
her
great
comfort
that
what
makes
you
think
she'll
listen
to
you
because
very
convincing
i'm
her
watcher
i
think
you're
neglecting
the
pasttense
there
rupert
besides
she
barely
listened
to
you
when
you
were
in
charge
i've
seen
the
way
she
treats
you
oh
yes
and
how's
that
very
much
like
a
retired
librarian
look
i've
got
what
she
wants
as
long
as
she
has
what
i
want
spread
the
word
she
knows
where
to
find
me
i'll
think
about
it
oh
i
keep
thinking
okay
that's
the
cutest
thing
ever
and
then
she
does
something
cuter
and
completely
resets
the
whole
scale
did
you
see
her
yawn
earlier
yes
i
thought
i
was
going
to
die
oh
i
love
you
miss
kitty
fantastico
we
got
to
get
her
a
real
name
it's
so
cool
that
she's
ours
uh
yours
that
she's
yours
isis
cool
she
can
be
ours
if
you
want
you
still
need
an
elective
how
about
sophomore
level
psychology
oh
kinda
psyched
out
since
professor
walsh
maybe
something
fun
like
drama
i
could
be
dramatic
you
cannot
have
more
catnip
you
have
a
catnip
problem
definitely
drama
i
haven't
even
dealt
with
the
housing
situation
yet
have
you
done
anything
i
hear
there
some
offcampus
places
that
are
way
cool
for
groups
to
you
know
go
in
on
oh
i
just
figured
you'd
be
dorming
it
up
with
buffy
again
well
we
haven't
really
talked
about
it
i
used
to
assume
we'd
be
roomies
through
grad
school
well
into
little
old
lady
hood
you
know
cheating
at
bingo
together
and
forgetting
to
take
our
pills
but
but
i
don't
know
it
hardly
feels
like
we're
roomies
now
i
mean
she's
busy
with
riley
and
i'm
gone
a
lot
too
i
guess
i
should
ask
her
riley
i
got
a
little
tired
of
sitting
around
waiting
so
you
joined
the
circus
xander
took
my
clothes
to
clean
'em
and
left
me
these
does
he
uh
hate
me
in
some
way
i
don't
know
about
yet
i
think
i
would've
attracted
less
attention
in
my
uniform
is
it
okay
for
you
to
be
here
you
tell
me
i
just
meant
with
the
government
branch
hunting
you
down
and
all
i'm
good
and
uh
it
took
me
a
while
but
i
patched
into
their
frequency
can't
sneak
up
on
a
guy
if
he's
listening
in
you're
the
sneakiest
why
they
hired
me
you
okay
yeah
i
just
angel
kind
of
upset
me
how
it's
not
that
interesting
got
my
attention
he
just
spun
my
head
a
little
you
don't
want
to
talk
about
it
it's
just
deconstructing
angel
can
wait
right
now
i
just
want
to
get
out
there
and
patrol
andand
find
adam
we
can
talk
about
it
later
it's
the
pants
isn't
it
it's
okay
i
couldn't
take
me
seriously
in
these
things
either
riley

not
that
big
a
deal

you

out
of
your
face

recharge
them
every
two
hours

girliemates

talking
something
about
uh

having
a
laugh
figured
you
were
signing
up
say

got
anything
larger
in
the
toy
gun
line
all
i
can
can
you
believe

like
i'm
some
sort
of
useless
lunk
it
happens
i'm
good
at
a
lot
of
things
i
help
out
with
all
kinds
of
stuff
i
have
skills
and
stratagems
i'm
very
help
me
out
he's
viking
in
the
sack
terrific
you
didn't
have
these
cleaned
after
the
last
time
did
you
this
is
so
like
them
lately
it's
all
about
them
and
the
college
life
well
you
know
what
college
is
it's
high
school
only
without
the
actual
going
to
class
well
high
school
was
kinda
like
that
too
but
the
point
is
i'm
out
there
working
hard
to
make
a
living
it's
nothing
but
a
huge
joke
to
them
xander
got
fired
from
starbucks
xander
got
fired
from
that
phonesex
line
they
look
down
on
you
and
they
hate
you
but
they
don't
look
down
on
me
hey
it
was
just
a
laugh
there's
no
need
to
go
insane
over
it
is
anybody
talking
to
you
sir
no
sir
don't
shoot
give
me
a
reason
not
to
you're
killing
humans
now
not
yet
beating
you
senseless
should
do
just
fine
i
can
have
a
patrol
here
in
under
a
minute
so
here's
the
plan
you
go
you're
way
i'll
go
mine
i'm
checking
out
that
cave
my
orders
exactly
alone
we're
spread
a
little
thin
so
yeah
family's
tearing
apart
family
what
kind
of
family
are
you
corleones
we
weren't
until
you
showed
up
what
no
girls
in
the
club
you
think
you're
the
first
girlfriend
riley's
ever
had
such
a
big
head
on
that
skinny
little
body
no
you're
just
the
first
one
to
get
him
to
commit
treason
riley
had
a
career
and
a
future
till
he
met
you
and
yeah
i
got
a
problem
with
that
a
future
a
future
doing
what
illegal
experiments
torture
murder
i
guess
killing
someone
isn't
really
a
problem
for
you
less
and
less
and
why
don't
you
get
the
hell
out
of
here
before
i
touch
me
and
you'll
find
out
what
slayer
strength
is
like
i
think
it's
about
time
you
showed
me
then
yes
i
think
that
would
be
interesting
get
out
of
here
not
moving
thank
you
go
get
out
no
oh
god
i
think
i
lost
the
buggers
any
luck
with
the
disks
took
what
they
had
should
be
something
useful
on
one
of
them
hope
so
what
are
we
looking
for
anything
about
adam
were
there
any
problems
getting
in
and
out
no
i
mean
a
couple
of
them
made
me
on
the
way
out
but
i
took
care
of
'em
gave
them
a
good
runningawayfromthem
did
you
well
yeah
when
do
i
get
paid
when
willow
tells
me
you've
brought
us
something
useful
i
could've
gone
straight
to
the
slayer
you
know
i
cut
you
in
let
you
pretend
you're
actually
in
charge
now
you've
got
to
wait
for
red's
permission
to
finish
the
deal
as
soon
as
we
see
what's
on
the
disks
it
looks
like
gibberish
gibberish
they're
encrypted
oh
wonderful
can
you
fix
'em
crack
a
government
encryption
code
on
my
laptop
easy
as
really
difficult
pie
why
you're
not
exactly
the
whiz

days

never
gonna
get
paid

his
old
tricks

hurt
anybody

him

hurt
you

heh
some
threat

barely
stand
trigger
finger

okay
you
actually

with
this
guy
okay

one
more
display
of
testosterone
poisoning

i
will
personally
put
you

in
the
hospital
anybody
think
i'm
exaggerating
he
started
riley
i'm
sorry
just
wanted
to
know
that
you
were
safe
i
need
to
talk
to
angel
for
a
minute
what
riley
please
i'm
not
leaving
this
room
i
mean
it
not
moving
a
muscle
okay
i
come
to
see
you
to
help
you
and
you
treat
me
like
i'm
just
your
ex
well
technically
shut
up
and
then
you
order
me
out
of
your
city
and
then
you
come
here
and
start
pounding
on
my
boyfriend
i
would
really
like
to
know
what
the
hell
are
you
trying
to
do
i
was
trying
to
make
things
better
heh
well
it's
a
going
pretty
good
don't
you
think
swell
you
know
heh
i
couldn't
leave
it
like
that
the
way
i
spoke
to
you
i
came
to
apologize
i
i
had
no
right
and
riley
i
got
jumped
by
some
soldiers
he
came
in
in
the
middle
and
wasn't
real
forthcoming
with
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
put
yourself
in
his
place
i
get
it
look
you
weren't
entirely
wrong
what
you
said
in
la
we
don't
live
in
each
other's
worlds
anymore
i
had
no
right
to
barge
in
on
yours
and
make
judgments
i'm
still
sorry
thank
you
and
next
time
i'll
apologize
by
phone
uh
things
are
pretty
tense
around
here
they
really
are
can
i
do
anything
honestly
i
think
the
best
thing
you
can
do
right
now
is
okay
it
means
a
lot
that
you
came
oh
and
riley
yeah
i
don't
like
him
thank
you
now
that
was
fun
you
were
successful
easier
than
i'd
thought
it'd
be
too
you're
sure
feel
it
in
my
bones
it's
uh
called
the
yoko
factor
don't
tell
me
you've
never
heard
of
the
beatles
i
have
i
like
helter
skelter
what
a
surprise
the
point
is
they
were
once
a
real
powerful
group
it's
not
a
stretch
to
say
they
ruled
the
world
and
when
they
broke
up
everyone
blamed
yoko
but
the
fact
is
the
group
split
itself
apart
she
just
happened
to
be
there
and
you
know
how
it
is
with
kids
they
go
off
to
college
they
grow
apart
way
of
the
world
so
you
separated
the
slayer
from
her
friends
i'm
pleased
well
since
we've
got
all
our
ducks
in
a
row
and
not
talking
to
each
other
guess
it's
time
for
the
grand
plan
huh
you
know
the
one
where
i
get
the
chipectomy
you
got
everything
you
need
right
no
there's
one
more
thing
how
bad
are
you
hurt
dunno
yet
night's
still
young
riley
i
have
to
tell
you
something
figured
maybe
you
want
to
sit
down
i'm
fine
riley
i
wait
me
first
buffy
i
feel
like
we've
gotten
really
close
at
least
i
thought
we
had
i
don't
know
much
about
angel
or
your
relationship
with
him
but
all
i
ask
is
if
you're
gonna
break
heart
do
it
fast
what
you
think
that
angel
and
i
didn't
you
no
of
course
not
how
can
you
even
ask
me
that
i
don't
know
xander
said
xander
oh
he's
the
deadest
man
in
deadonia
no
it's
not
his
fault
i
prodded
and
he
explained
how
angel
went
bad
the
uh
trigger
oh
and
uh
after
that
i
went
a
little
nuts
you
know
i
mean
on
the
one
hand
i
should
believe
in
us
but
on
the
other
sometimes
things
happen
between
exes
and
when
i
saw
that
he
was
bad
he's
not
bad
seriously
that's
a
good
day
well
there
you
go
even
when
he's
good

all
mister
billowy
coat
king
of
pain
and
girls

i
ever
given
you
any
reason

a
reason

rip
your
arms

you
might
have
to
ship
me
off
to
the
army
to
get
me
out
of
the
way
the
army
you
didn't
think
i
knew
about
that
did
you
you
two
talking
about
me
behind
my
back
us
talking
about
you
how
about
you
telling
riley
every
last
detail
of
my
life
with
angel
and
besides
when
is
there
any
us
two
you
two
are
the
two
who
are
the
two
i'm
the
other
one
uhhuh

maybe
that
all
changes
when
i'm
doing
situps
over
at
fort
dix
fort
dix
are
you
drunk
yes
quite
a
bit
actually
well
stop
it
this
is
stupid
stupid
so
you
finally
have
the
guts
to
say
it
to
my
face
i
didn't
say
you
were
stupid
so
stop
being
an
idiot
and
let
me
fix
this
okay
i
need
you

need
both
of
you
all
the
time

very
dangerous
wait
how
do
you
need
me
really
you're
good
with
the
computer
stuff
usually
andand
there's
the
witch
stuff
witch
stuff
what
exactly
do
you
mean
by
witch
stuff
you
guys
what
is
happening
this
is
crazy
oh
no
it's
not
it's
all
finally
making
perfect
sense
and
i'm
not
going
to
miss
a
moment
of
it
you
think
this
will
go
on
for
a
while
hard
to
say
nice
bathroom
like
the
tile
and
if
i
did
join
the
army
i'd
be
great
you
know
why
'cause
they
might
give
me
a
job
that
couldn't
be
done
by
any
welltrained
border
collie
that's
it
i'm
going
to
bed
no
you'd
do
wonderful
in
the
army
hey
do
you
think
the
umbilical
cord
between
you
and
anya
can
stretch
that
far
i
knew
it
i
knew
you
hated
her
look
i'm
not
the
one
being
judgmental
here
i'll
leave
that
territory
to
you
and
buffy
judgmental
if
i
was
anymore
openminded
about
the
choices
you
two
make
my
whole
brain
would
fall
out
oh
and
superior
don't
forget
that
just
because
you're
better
than
us
doesn't
mean
that
you
can
be
all
superior
you
guys
stop
this
what
happened
to
you
today
it's
not
today
buffy
things
have
been
wrong
for
a
while
don't
you
see
that
what
do
you
mean
wrong
well
they
certainly
haven't
been
right
since
tara
we
have
to
face
it
you
can't
handle
tara
being
my
girlfriend
no
it
was
bad
before
that
since
you
two
went
off
to
college
and
forgot
about
me
just
left
me
in
the
basement
to
tara's
your
girlfriend
bloody
hellll
enough
all
i
know
is
you
want
to
help
right
be
part
of
the
team
i
don't
know
anymore
really
not
wanted
no
no
you
said
you
wanted
to
go
so
let's
go
all
of
us
we'll
walk
into
that
cave
with
you
two
attacking
me
and
the
funny
drunk
drooling
on
my
shoe
hey
hey
maybe
that's
the
secret
way
of
killing
adam
buffy
is
that
it
is
that
how
you
can
help
you're
not
answering
me
how
can
you
possibly
help
so
i
guess
i'm
starting
to
understand
why
there's
no
ancient
prophecy
about
a
chosen
one
and
her
friends
if
i
need
help
i'll
go
to
someone
i
can
count
on
i've
been
waiting
for
you
and
now
i'm
here
