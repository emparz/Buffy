to
a

interestingly
enough
i've
decided
to
give
your
job
to
someone
who'll
actually
do
it
honest
to
god
ben
i've
been
calling
you
for
two
weeks
where
the
hell
have
you
been

on
i

i
haven't
been

explanation

this
which

can
i
just
tell

it's
not
my
fault
sure
you
can
also
tell
me
that
the
dog
ate
your
homework
or
maybe
eating
twinkies
made
you
do
it
or
maybe
yeah
that
there's
really
a
wicked
demonic
creature
living
inside
you
that
takes
control
of
your
body
and
forces
you
to
do
its
bidding
take
responsibility
for
your
actions
ben
i
this

you
know
forget
it
just
forget
it
this
is
so
unfair
you're
taking
everything
away
from
me
everything
i
worked
for
i
earned
i
care
about
these
are
my
choices
this
is
my
life
and
you're
ruining
it
no
no
not
here
not
now
please
i'm
ben
i'm
ben
i'm
ben
i'm
hungry
we
got
this
part
right
that's
for
sure
lot
of
sucky
things
in
this
dimension
bubble
baths
not
one
of
'em
know
what
i
mean
i
am
in
thunderous
agreement
oh
glittering
glistening
glorificus
i
wasn't
talking
to
you
uh
begging
your
pardon
and
begging
in
general
but
were
you
talking
to
me
eww
yeah
right
like
any
of
you
have
ever
bathed
anyway
oh
but
we
do
your
scrumptiousness
we
bathe
in
your
splendiforous
radiance
your
aromatic
how
about
you
shut
up
and
listen
to
me
you
disgusting
little
fools
okay
now
i
asked
for
the
key
and
you
brought
me
a
vampire
a
pulseless
impure
folliclyfried
vampire
loofah
so
what
i
think
we
have
here
is
a
failure
for
you
to
do
your
frickin'
jobs
pardon
my
french
mimosa
mmm

vitamins
so
i
think
you
better
rack
your
little
minion
brains
and
tell
me
everything
that
you
saw
when
you
were
spying
on
buffy
and
her
wacky
pals
everything
mm
then
i'll
figure
out
who
the
key
is
you
lied
to
me
didn't
lie
eexactly
really
what
about
all
the
times
i
asked
you
how
school
was
and
you
said
fine
well
it
was
you
didn't
ask
if
i
was
in
it
when
it
was
fine
ii
don't
know
what
to
say
ii'm
sure
you're
aware
that
the
past
few
months
you
know
have
been
kind
of
hard
for
dawn
not
that
i'm
saying
that's
an
excuse
i
understand
your
mother
was
a
lovely
woman
and
we'll
all
miss
her
very
much
i
know
how
difficult
it
must
be
it
is
especially
for
dawn
sheshe's
just
a
kid
well
i
think
we
both
know
that
dawn
is
a
lot
more
than
just
a
kid
she's
a
talented
young
girl
with
a
sharp
mind

when
she
puts
the
effort
in
look
i
realize
that
there's
been
some
balldropping
but
i'm
sure
this
will
all
dawn
why
don't
you
wait
outside
for
a
few
minutes
honey
old
saying
a
watched
customer
never
buys
they
would
if
they
were
patriotic
okay
i'm
goin'
in
patriotic
yes
i've
recently
come
to
realize
there's
more
to
me
than
just
being
human
i'm
also
an
american
yes
i
suppose
you
are
in
a
manner
of
speaking
you
were
born
here
your
mortal
self
well
that's
right
foreigner
so
i've
been
reading
a
lot
about
the
good
ol'
us
of
a
embracing
the
extraordinarily
precious
ideology
that's
helped
to
shape
and
define
it
democracy
capitalism
the
free
market
depends
on
the
profitable
exchange
of
goods
for
currency
it's
a
system
of
symbiotic
beauty
apparently
lost
on
these
old
people
look
at
'em
perusing
the
shelves
undressing
the
merchandise
with
their
eyeballs
all
ogle
no
cash
it's
not
just
annoying
it's
unamerican
appalling
almost
as
if
they
no
longer
think
money
can
buy
happiness
totally
unamerican
oh
and
you
know
what
else
is
unamerican
french
people
you
don't
say
from
what
i
hear
they
don't
tip
now
french
old
people
that's
really
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
you
know
ahn
how's
about
we
try
being
a
bit
less
prejudiced
and
a
bit
more
inclusive

gonna
make
those
fogeys

grownup

dawn
needs
an
authority
figure
a
strong
guiding
hand
she'll
listen
to
you
just
like
you
always
have
i
listen
i
do
well
then
perk
up
your
ears
i
may
be
a
grownup
but
you're
her
family
her
only
real
family
now
she
needs
you
to
do
this
right
she
needs
me

the
grownup
the
authority
figure
the
the
strong
guiding
hand
and
and
stompy
foot

the
spirit
okay
i
can

okay
here
we
go
early
to
bed
early
to
rise
balanced
breakfast
hospital
corners
it's
a
new
beginning
discipline
authority
order
what
is
this
i
thought
i
told
you
to
do
your
homework
i
was
please
don't
lie
to
me
i'm
not
we
were
acting
out
a
geometry
problem
'cause
i
read
this
really
neat
article
that
said
kids
learn
math
better
if
you
you
stimulate
their
uh
visual
learning
pattern
you
know
using
the
right
side
of
the
brain
instead
of
just
the
left
stuff
like
that
uhhuh
so
we
made
a
triangle
with
our
bodies
and
that's
when
i
called
xander
obtuse
and
he
got
really
grumpy
and
then
dawn
said
we
were
acute
triangle
and
well
hilarity
ensued
right
well
you
know
what
i
think
i
think
maybe
dawn
should
do
her
homework
at
home
bbut
it
was
working
i
was
really
learning
please
get
your
stuff
fine
don't
listen
to
me
please
don't
be
grouchy
with
her
who
among
us
can
resist
the
allure
of
really
funny
math
puns
it's
really
important
that
dawn
finishes
her
schoolwork
right
now
yeah
i
know
but
we
were
having
good
clean
educational
fun
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
was
all
gloom
and
doom
and
the
outlawing
of
human
triangles
it's
really
important
that
dawn
finishes
her
schoolwork
right
now
i
know
it
is
and
i'm
a
big
fan
of
school
you
know
me
i'm
like
go
school
it's
your
birthday
or
something
to
that
effect
look
willow
i
know
that
you
mean
well
but
you
just
don't
understand
and
there's
no
way
that
you
could
i
do
so
understand
it
you're
stressed
out
i'm
more
than
stressed
out
i'm
freaked
out
yeah
well
maybe
you
need
a
break
to
defreak
hey
you
could
go
to
the
world's
culture
fair
if
you
want
to
with
me
and
tara
i
don't
think
so
come
on
you
can
bring
dawn
it'll
be
fun
good
educationaltype
fun
in
a
discipliney
sort
of
way
i
can't
do
it
will
don't
worry
it's
not
like
i
don't
have
a
life
i
do
i
have
dawn's
life
ready
so
it's
her
under
our
noses
all
this
time
i
like
the
detail
work
those
monks
did
quirks
foibles
passions
it's
all
so
cute
so
human
you
know
pretty
convincing
really
but
not
convincing
enough
you
all
know
your
assignments
i
think
it's
time
to
collect
the
key
it
wasn't
anything
really
buffy
was
just
a
little
crabby
at
dawn
about
her
schoolwork
well
it's
understandable
yeah
sure
it
is
i'd
totally
be
blowing
off
classes
if
i
were
in
dawnie's
shoes
sweetie
you
wouldn't
blow
off
a
class
if
your
head
was
on
fire
and
i
meant
buffy
buffy
what
understandable
about
the
crabby
she
has
to
look
after
dawn
now
yeah
but
not
in
a
miss
minchin's
select
seminary
for
girls
way
i
mean
she's
just
gonna
make
dawnie
more
rebellious
i
had
to
deal
with
my
brother's
problems
after
i
mean
you
can't
really
know
what
it's
like
to
yeah
i
know
that
i
i
didn't
mean
to
no
i
just
i
i
know
i
can't
know
what
you
went
through
but
i
just

it's
no
big
i
made
you
mad
no
no
all
i
meant
was
no
it's
okay
this
whole
buffy
thing
let's
just
forget
it
no
please
i
mean
i
mean
tell
me
if
i
said
something
wrong
otherwise
i
know
i'll
say
it
again
probably
often
and
in
public
no
i
was
snippy
gal
it's
just
i
know
i
can't
on
some
level

it's
like
my
opinion
isn't
worth
anything
because
i
haven't
been
through

i
didn't
lose
my
mom
so
i
don't
know
well
ii'm
not
the
expert
i
mean
i've
only
lost
the
one
do
i
act
like
the
big
knowledge
woman
no
is
that
no
spelled
yes
sort
of
i
mean
i
just
feel
like
thethe
junior
partner
you've
been
doing
everything
longer
than
me
you've
been
out
longer
you've
been
practicing
witchcraft
way
longer
oh
but
you're
way
beyond
me
there
in
just
a
few
i
mean
it
frightens
me
how
powerful
you're
getting
that's
a
weird
word
getting
it
frightens
you
i
frighten
you
that
is
so
not
what
i
meant
i
meant
iimpresses
impressive
well
i
took
psych
101
i
mean
i
took
it
from
an
evil
government
scientist
who
was
skewered
by
her
frankensteinlike
creation
before
the
final
but
i
know
what
a
freudian
slip
is
ddon't
you
trust
me
with
my
life
that's
not
what
i
mean
can't
we
just
go
to
the
fair
i
don't
feel
real
multicultural
right
now
wh
what
is
it
about
me
that
you
don't
trust
it's
not
that
i
worry
sometimes
you're
you're
changing
so
much
so
fast
i
don't
know
where
you're
heading
where
i'm
heading
i'm
saying
everything
wrong
no
i
think
you're
being
pretty
clear
this
isn't
about
the
witchcraft
it's
about
the
other
changes
in
my
life
i
trust
you
i
just

i
don't
know
where
i'm
gonna
fit
in
in
your
life
when
when
i
change
back
yeah
this
is
a
college
thing
just
a
a
little
experimentation
before
i
get
over
the
thrill
and
head
back
to
boys'
town
you
think
that
should
i
i'm
really
sorry
that
i
didn't
establish
my
lesbo
street
cred
before
i
got
into
this
relationship
you're
the
only
woman
i've
ever
fallen
in
love
with
so
how
on
earth
could
you
ever
take
me
seriously
willow
please
have
fun
at
the
fair
okay
so
ii
think
the
next
step
is
to
make
a
chart
a
schedule
i'll
write
down
all
the
things
you're
supposed
to
do
and
when
you
have
to
do
them
and
then
i'll
leave
a
box
next
to
it
which
you
can
mark
with
an
x
when
you've
accomplished
the
task
what
you
want
gold
stars
okay
you
can
have
gold
stars
i
don't
want
gold
stars
i
don't
want
any
of
this
i'm
just
trying
to
give
you
a
normal
life
well
good
luck
what
what
am
i
doing
wrong
now
this
is
for
real
dawn
no
it's
not
i'm
not
real
so
why
would
my
exciting
graph
of
chores
be
real
who
cares
if
a
key
gets
an
education
anyway
it's
a
chart
not
a
graph
and
you
are
real
yeah
those
monks
put
grades
k
through
eight
in
my
head
can't
we
just
wait
and
see
if
they
drop
nine
in
there
too
damn
it
dawn
this
is
serious
why
why
should
i
care
about
any
of
this
because
they'll
take
you
away
take
me
away
what
do
you
mean
they'll
take
you
away
from
me
that's
what
your
principal
told
me
when
you
weren't
in
the
room
if
i
can't
make
you
go
to
school
then
i
won't
be
found
fit
to
be
your
legal
guardian
where
would
i
go
i
don't
know
dad
maybe
or
foster
care
i
i
didn't
really
want
to
ask
you
could've
told
me
that
i
just
did
is
this
seat
taken
i
hope
this
isn't
a
return
everyone
wants
petrified
hamsters
and
they're
never
happy
with
them
you
all
right
yeah
ah
yes
because
your
good
mood
is
both
obvious
and
contagious
i
had
a
fight
with
tara
it
was
awful
oh
i'm
sorry
me
too
you
two
don't
quarrel
much
do
you
never
until
today
well
now
it's
over
over
how
can
it
be
over
i
just
found
her
the
quarrel
is
over
oh
yeah
uh
you'll
feel
better
when
you've
made
your
apologies
and
you'll
know
that
you
can
fight
without
the
world
ending
i
know
it
all
seems
bleak
now
but
as
they
say
this
too
shall
pass
wow
now
what
do
we
have
here
oh
he's
one
of
those
things
that
work
for
glory
yes
how
helpful

imagine
what
you'd
feel
with
my
fingers
wiggling
in
your
brain
it
doesn't
kill
you
what
it
does
is
make
you
feel
like
you're
in
a
noisy
little
dark
room

naked
and
ashamed
and
there
are
things
in
the
dark
that
need
to
hurt
you
because
you're
bad
little
pinching
things
that
go
in
your
ears

and
crawl
on
the
inside
of
your
skull
and
you
know
that
if
the
noise
and
the
crawling
would
stop
that
you
could
remember
how
to
get
out
but
you
never
ever
will
who
is
the
key

paybacky
on

actually
