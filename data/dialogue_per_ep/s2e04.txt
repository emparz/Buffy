this
is
so
unfair
i
don't
think
it's
that
bad
it's
the
uebersuck
mom
could've
at
least
warned
me
well
a
lot
of
parents
are
doing
it
this
year
it's
part
of
this
whole
cultural
exchange
magilla
the
exhibit
the
dance
i
have
the
best
costume
for
the
dance
a
complete
stranger
in
my
house
for
two
weeks
i'm
gonna
be
insane
a
danger
to
myself
and
others
within
three
days
i
swear
i
think
the
exchange
student
program's
cool
i
do
it's
a
beautiful
melding
of
two
cultures
have
you
ever
done
an
exchange
program
my
dad
tried
to
send
me
to
some
armenians
once
does
that
count
ooo
there's
mine
sven
isn't
he
lunchable
mine's
definitely
the
best
what're
you
lookin'
at
pictures
of
our
exchange
students
look
100
swedish
100
gorgeous
100
staying
at
my
house
so
how's
yours
visually
i
mean
i
don't
know
guy
like
by
guylike
we
are
talking
big
beefy
guylike
girl
right
i
was
just
told
'guy'
you
didn't
look
at
him
first
he
could
be
dogly
you
live
on
the
edge
hold
on
a
sec
so
this
person
who's
living
with
you
for
two
weeks
is
a
man
with
man
parts
this
is
a
terrible
idea
what
about
the
beautiful
melding
of
two
cultures
there's
no
melding
okay
he
better
keep
his
parts
to
himself
what's
he
doing
uh
that's
rodney
munson
he's
god's
gift
to
the
bell
curve
what
he
lacks
in
smarts
he
makes
up
in
lack
of
smarts
you
just
don't
like
him
'cause
of
that
time
he
beat
you
up
every
day
for
five
years
yeah
i'm
irrational
that
way
i
better
stop
him
before
he
gets
in
trouble
i
got
it
the
nonviolent
approach
is
probably
better
here
i
wasn't
gonna
use
violence
i
don't
always
use
violence
do
i
the
important
thing
is
you
believe
that
what're
you
oh
willow
hi
that's
probably
not
something
you're
supposed
to
be
doing
you
could
get
in
trouble
oh
no
and
they
might
kick
me
outta
school
are
we
still
on
for
our
chem
tutorial
tomorrow
yeah
i
think
i
got
almost
all
fourteen
natural
elements
memorized
there're
a
hundred
and
three
welcome
students
we
shall
now
proceed
into
the
incan
burial
chamber
the
human
sacrifice
is
about
to
begin
typical
museum
trick
promise
human
sacrifice
deliver
old
pots
and
pans
five
hundred
years
ago
the
incan
people
chose
a
beautiful
teenage
girl
to
become
their
princess
i
hope
this
story
ends
with
'and
she
lived
happily
ever
after'
xander
no
i
think
it
ends
with
'and
she
became
a
scary
discolored
shriveled
mummy'
guide
the
incan
people
sacrificed
their
princess
to
the
mountain
god
sebancaya
an
offering
buried
alive
for
eternity
in
this
dark
tomb
they
could've
at
least
wrapped
her
in
those
nice
white
bandages
like
in
the
movies
the
princess
remained
there
protected
only
by
a
cursed
seal
placed
there
as
a
warning
to
any
who
would
wake
her
so
buffy
when's
exchangeo
boy
making
his
appearance
his
name's
ampata
gonna
be
at
the
bus
station
tomorrow
night
ooo
the
sunnydale
bus
depot
classy
what
a
better
way
to
introduce
someone
to
our
country
than
with
the
stench
of
urine
now
if
you'll
follow
me
this
way
please
aha
cool
oh
damn
so
can
i
go
i
think
not
how
come
because
you
are
the
chosen
one
mm
just
this
once
i'd
like
to
be
the
overlooked
one
well
i'm
afraid
that
is
not
you
have
responsibilities
that
other
girls
do
not
oh
i
know
this
one
slaying
entails
certain
sacrifices
blah
blah
bity
blah
i'm
so
stuffy
gimme
a
scone
it's
as
if
you
know
me
your
secret
identity
is
gonna
be
difficult
enough
to
maintain
while
this
exchange
student
is
living
with
you
nooot
with
her
in
the
same
house
as
her
am
i
the
only
one
who's
objective
enough
to
make
that
distinction
so
i
think
going
to
the
dance
like
a
normal
person
would
be
the
best
way
to
keep
that
secret
giles
come
on
budge
no
one
likes
a
non
budger
fine
go
yay
i
win
i'll
just
go
and
introduce
my
shoulder
to
a
an
icepack
so
i
guess
we're
dancebound
cool
i
think
i
can
get
my
mom's
car
so
i'm
wheel
man
i
thought
you
were
taking
willow
well
yeah
i'm
gonna
take
willow
but
i'm
not
gonna
take
willow
in
the
sense
of
'take
me'
see
with
you
we're
three
and
everybody's
safe
without
you
we're
two
ah
and
we
enter
dateville
romance
flowers
lips
oh
come
on
in
all
the
years
you've
know
willow
you've
never
thought
about
her
lips
buffy
i
love
willow
and
she's
my
best
friend
which
makes
her
not
the
kind
of
girl
who
i
think
about
her
lips
that
much
she's
the
kind
of
girl
that
i'm
best
friends
with
hey
guys
willow
hi
we
were
just
talkin'
about
happy
things
like
the
three
of
us
going
to
the
dance
together
see
happy
not
happy
no
uh
oh
yyes
no
rodney's
missing
trouble
with
mr
munson
again
his
parents
say
he
never
came
home
last
night
y'know
i
don't
think
i
remember
seeing
rodney
on
the
bus
back
from
the
field
trip
i
didn't
either
i
hope
he
didn't
get
in
trouble
at
the
museum
hey
maybe
he
awakened
the
mummy
right
and
it
rose
from
its
tomb
and
attacked
him
on
the
other
hand
maybe
rodney
just
stepped
out
for
a
smoke
for
twentyone
hours
it's
addictive
you
know
we'll
deal
with
that
when
we've
ruled
out
evil
curses
one
day
i'm
gonna
live
in
a
town
where
evil
curses
are
just
generally
ruled
out
without
even
saying
there
was
a
seal
it
was
right
here
and
it's
broken
does
that
mean
the
mummy's
loose
no
comfy
as
ever
look
at
this
series
of
pictograms
okay
i
just
saved
us
right
something
did
well
we'll
fret
about
the
details
later
let's
just
get
out
of
here
before
he
comes
back
giles
were
the
incas
very
advanced
yes
yes
very
did
they
have
orthodontists
rodney
looked
like
he
had
been
dead
for
five
hundred
years
how
could
that
be
maybe
we
should
ask
that
crazy
man
with
the
big
old
knife
i
don't
think
he
seemed
overly
chatty
the
way
he
bolted
when
he
saw
rodney
i'd
say
he
was
as
freaked
as
we
were
my
resources
on
this
subject
are
extremely
limited
ii
gather
that
this
particular
mummy
was
from
the
sebancaya
region
of
eastern
peru
it's
very
remote
now
if
there's
an
answer
then
it's
it's
locked
in
the
in
the
seal
it's
gonna
take
me
weeks
to
translate
these
pictograms
well
we'll
start
tonight
with
ampata
i
was
gonna
suggest
hunting
no
i'm
late

told
my
mom

pick
him
up

your
priorities

bye
sven
come
oz
man
what
do
you
think
of
what
cordelia
man
she's
a
wonderland
tour
you
gotta
admit
the
girl
is
hot
yeah
she's
a
hot
girl
let
me
guess
not
your
type
what
does
a
girl
have
to
do
to
impress
you
well
it
involves
a
feathered
boa
and
a
theme
to
'a
summer
place'
i
can't
discuss
it
here
you're
too
picky
man
do
you
know
how
many
girls
you
could
have
you're
lead
guitar
oz
it's
currency
i'm
not
picky
you're
just
impressed
by
any
pretty
girl
that
can
walk
and
talk
she
doesn't
have
to
talk
i
worked
really
hard
on
my
costume
it's
pretty
cool
okay
but
what
about
me
i've
gotta
think
well
it's
a
celebration
of
cultures
there
are
lots
of
dress
up
alternatives
and
a
corresponding
equal
number
of
mocking
alternatives
all
aimed
at
me
bavarians
are
cool
okay
no
shirts
with
ruffles
no
hats
with
feathers
and
definitely
no
lederhosen
they
make
my
calves
look
fat
why
are
you
suddenly
so
worried
about
looking
like
an
idiot
your
first
day
of
school
nervous
it
is
just
more
people
than
i
have
seen
in
a
long
time
ah
don't
worry
you
will
have
no
problems
making
friends
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
know
someone
who's
dying
to
meet
you
how
do
you
do
hi
i
was
i
was
wondering
if
you
could
um
translate
this
that
was
in
no
way
awkward
something
wrong
uh
no
uh
it
is
uh
why
are
you
asking
me
well
uh
uh
it's
well
it's
an
artifact
from
from
uh
your
region
iit's
uh
from
the
tomb
of
aan
incan
mummy
aaactually
we
were
trying
to
translate
it
uh
um
as
aa
project
for
our
um
our
archeology
club
very
good
it
is
broken
where
are
the
other
pieces
that's
all
we
found
hmm
it
is
very
old
and
valuable
you
should
hide
it
is
is
uh
anything
you
recognize
here
um
um
this
this
um
this
chchap
here
with
the
knife
for
instance
well
ii
do
not
know
exactly
but
iii
think
this
represents
i
believe
the
word
is
'bodyguard'
bodyguard
interesting
legend
has
it
that
he
guards
the
mummy
against
those
who
would
disturb
her
well
uh
yes
well
that's
um
that's
a
very
good
starting
point
for
our
um
club
um
oh
and
uh
aas
club
president
i
have
um
lots
to
do
lots
of
stuff
dull
stuff
uh
oh
willow
maybe
you
could
stay
with
ampata
for
the
day
i'd
love
to
yes
that
will
be
fun
right
i'll
uh
continue
with
the
translation
buffy
you
research
this
uh
bodyguard
thing
and
uh
willow
willow
boy
they
really
like
each
other
and
this
is
called
a
snack
food
snack
food
yeah
it's
a
delicious
spongy
golden
cake
stuffed
with
a
delightful
creamy
white
substance
of
goodness
and
here's
how
you
eat
it
mmhm
oh
but
now
i
cannot
try
it
that's
why
you
bring
two
oh
here
goes
good
huh
and
the
exciting
part
is
that
they
have
no
ingredients
that
a
human
can
pronounce
so
it
doesn't
leave
you
with
that
heavy
food
feeling
in
your
stomach
you
are
strange
girls
always
tell
me
that
right
before
they
run
away
i
like
it
i
like
you
like
it
please
don't
learn
from
my
english
ha
or
possible
ha
do
you
think
this
matches
hey
oh
yes
i'm
caring
about
mummies
ampata's
only
staying
two
weeks
yeah
and
then
xander
can
find
someone
else
who's
not
me
to
obsess
about
at
least
with
you
i
knew
he
didn't
have
a
shot
well
you
know
i
have
a
choice
i
can
spend
my
life
waiting
for
xander
to
go
out
with
every
other
girl
in
the
world
until
he
notices
me
or
i
can
just
get
on
with
my
life
good
for
you
well
i
didn't
choose
yet
good
lord
good
work
my
work
yes
this
is
most
illuminating
it
seems
rodney's
killer
might
be
the
mummy
where
does
it
say
that
well
here
it
implies
that
the
mummy
is
capable
of
feeding
on
the
life
force
of
a
person
effectively
freezedrying
them
you
might
say
extraordinary
so
then
we
just
have
to
stop
the
mummy
which
leads
to
the
question
how
do
we
a
find
and
b
stop
the
mummy
well
the
answer
to
that
is
somewhere
still
in
here
or
in
the
rest
of
the
seal
you
stole
the
seal
where
is
it
it
is
you
here
you
are
thank
you
why's
this
guy
so
into
us
i
mean
what's
he
want
he
said
'give
me
the
seal'
giles
apparently
this
is
more
popular
than
we
realized
i
just
don't
know
what
we
we
should
do
with
it
destroy
it
if
you
do
not
someone
could
die
i'm
afraid
someone
already
has
you
mean
the
man
with
the
knife
killed
someone
uh
no
well
not
exactly
you
are
not
telling
me
everything
you're
right
ampata
and
it's
time
we
do
we're
not
an
archeology
club
we're
in
uh
we're
in
the
crime
club
which
is
kinda
like
the
chess
club
only
with
crime
and
um
no
chess
please
understand
me
that
seal
nearly
got
us
killed
it
must
be
destroyed
ampata
ampata
listen
to
me
nobody's
gonna
hurt
you
i
won't
let
them
your
investigation
is
dangerous
i
do
not
want
that
just
normal
life
is
she
okay
wigged
i'm
tryin'
to
convince
her
that
our
lives
aren't
just
danger
and
peril
around
here
you
should
take
her
to
the
dance
that's
a
good
idea
we'll
all
go
no
i
mean
just
you
but
you
were
psyched
and
your
costume
i'll
see
you
there
you
know
what
willow
you're
my
best
friend
i
know
i
don't
get
it
why
would
the
bodyguard
have
such
a
jones
for
a
broken
piece
of
rock
well
um
perhaps
he
needs
to
put
it
together
with
the
other
pieces
if
he
has
them
i
mean
we
didn't
find
them
and
if
he
didn't
then
then
they'd
still
be
at
the
museum

scary

laugh
in
your
face
and
pull
out
your
still
beating
heart
and
crush
it
into
the
ground
with
her
heel

she
could
defend
her
people
from
the
nether
world
out
of
all
the
girls
in
her
generation
she
was
the
only
one
chosen
do
you
know
the
story
it's
fairly
familiar
she
was
sixteen
like
us
she
was
offered
as
a
sacrifice
and
went
to
her
death
who
knows
what
she
had
to
give
up
to
fulfill
her
duty
to
others
what
chance
at
love

really
fitting
in
hmm
yeah
how
'bout
that
she's
in
ecstasy
her
hollowed
sky
pours
down
heavenly
fakes
desire
i've
been
living
here
in
the
red
i've
been
feeling
i'm
dead
again
oh
near
faux
pas
i
almost
wore
the
same
thing
we've
been
bored
before
hey
where's
sven
ohhh
i
keep
trying
to
ditch
him
he's
like
one
of
those
dogs
that
you
leave
at
the
grand
canyon
on
vacation
it
follows
you
back
across
four
states
see
my
own
speechless
human
boomerang
i
have
never
felt
so
alone
he's
kinda
cute
maybe
it's
nice
skippin'
all
that
small
talk
small
talk
how
'bout
simple
instruction
since
the
time
we
left
ourselves
half
past
gone
get
punchy
you
fruit
drinky
we've
been
living
here
up
against
the
red
he
can
follow
me
i've
been
feeling
i'm
dead
again
we've
been
bored
before
we'll
be
bored
again
we've
been
bored
before
and
again
i
think
i
should've
worn
something
sexy
wow
you
guys
look
great
ii
love
your
costume
it's
it's
very
authentic
thanks
yeah
you
look
um
snug
that's
what
i
was
going
for
where's
buffy
she's
in
ecstasy
her
hollowed
sky
thank
heavens
you're
home
yup
not
at
the
dance
not
with
my
friends
not
with
a
life
what
are
you
doing
here
i
thought
we
were
gonna
meet
at
the
museum
to
find
the
bodyguard
no
he's
already
been
found
in
a
school
restroom
mummified
okay
i
don't
get
it
why
would
the
mummy
kill
her
own
bodyguard
well
i've
crossreferenced
and
uh
i've
looked
at
the
pictograms
anew
he
was
a
guard
alright
but
it
was
his
job
to
insure
that
the
mummy
didn't
awaken
and
escape
so
ampata
translated
wrong
perhaps
hold
on
a
sec
she
was
wiggy
about
the
seal
from
minute
one
yes
i
suppose
she
was
her
trunks
i
beg
your
pardon
it's
certainly
all
boys'
clothes
why
would
a
girl
pack
these
how
'bout
this
one
what
kind
of
girl
travels
with
a
mummified
corpse
and
doesn't
even
pack
a
lipstick
time's
healing
i'm
ahead
find
a
reason
once
again
take
a
moment
outta
time
i'll
be
standing
back
behind
do
you
um
would
you
like
to
uh
you
know
on
a
wing
so
outta
line
i'd
love
to
dance
mm
taken
in
so
outta
time
hey
that
girl
who
is
she
she's
an
exchange
student
i
think
she's
from
south
america
no
not
her
the
eskimo
sound
the
season
in
my
head
come
on
can't
you
put
your
foot
down
it
is
down
one
of
these
days
you're
gonna
have
to
get
a
grownup
car
so
outta
time
all
it
takes
is
living
i
want
to
fly
i've
never
known
fate
i've
never
known
your
name
i've
never
known
fate
okay
at
least
i
can
rule
out
something
i
said
someone
take
me
home
get
me
outta
here
i
should've
guessed
remember
ampata
wanted
us
to
hide
the
seal
and
then
she
wanted
us
to
destroy
it
becau
oh
wait
uh
waiting
well
we
already
know
that
the
seal
was
used
to
contain
the
mummy
if
breaking
it
freed
her
reassembling
it
will
trap
her
i'll
go
to
the
museum
i'll
drop
you
off
i'll
try
to
piece
together
the
fragments
there
okay
i'll
still
get
xander
before
he
gets
smoochy
with
mummy
dearest
have
you
seen
ampata
what
was
that
i
shrugged
next
time
you
should
probably
say
'shrug'
sigh
i
thought
this
exchange
student
thing
would
be
a
great
deal
but
look
what
i
got
stuck
with
'momento'
'punchy
fruity
drinky'
is
cordelia
even
from
this
country
your
hands
feel
kinda
rough
aren't
you
with
xander
does
it
look
like
i'm
with
xander
ampata
that's
my
cue
to
leave
there
you
are
why'd
you
run
away
because
i
do
not
deserve
you
what
you
think
that
you
don't
deserve
me
man
i
love
you
are
those
tears
of
joy
pain
revulsion
i
am
very
happy
and
very
sad
then
talk
to
me
let
me
know
what's
wrong
i
can't
hey
i
know
why
you
can't
tell
me
it's
a
secret
right
and
if
you
told
me
you'd
have
to
kill
me

was
a
bad
joke

the
delivery
was
off
too

sorry
i
uh

sorry

can't
xander
