this
kind
of
frolicking
going
on
all
around
town
we're
not

get
very
far
without
let's
fly
pigeon
already
been
looted
sorry

the
appliance
store
down
the
block
they've
got
great
toasters
anya
xander
i
knew
you
weren't
dead
wow
then
why
was
i
so
worried
are
you
uh
not
yet
but
but
i
will
be
where's
dawn
and
spike
we've
been
calling
the
house
but
maybe
they're
on
their
way
here
i
mean
this
place
is
norad
and
we
are
at
defcon
one
okay
i
so
need
male
friends
we
have
to
go
out
and
look
for
them
there's
this
guy
at
work
i
kind
of
hit
it
off
with
tito
i
mean
he
seems
like
a
good
you
were
talking
about
dawn
and
spike
of
course
um
question
you
want
us
to
go
back
out
there
well
yeah
uh
unless
somebody's
got
a
better
idea
well
um
it's
just
we're
minus
a
buffybot
and
uh
spike
is
missing
in
action
somewhere
with
dawn
and
giles
flew
away
and
uh
well
you
you're
looking
a
little
magickedout
ahn
honey
we're
nearing
your
point
right
it's
just
how
are
we
supposed
to
fight
these
guys
i
mean
we
can
take
a
vampire
or
two
sure
but
there's
a
whole
cavalcade
of
demons
out
there

i
mean
i
think
this
you
know
it
it
takes
um
i
mean
i
we
need
buffy
buffy
buffy
is
not
coming
back
we
failed
so
we're
it
gang
xander
grab
the
weapons
we're
gonna
look
for
dawn
and
spike
if
we're
gonna
go
we
should
go
now
they're
just
getting
more
and
more
worked
up
by
the
moment
well
they
can't
keep
it
up
forever
i
mean
maybe
they'll
party
themselves
out
you
know
tire
of
this
place
and
move
on
say
hello
to
your
new
home
boys
this
here
is
a
momentous
occasion
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
now
no
question
the
open
backroads
and
highways
have
been
good
to
us
but
we've
got
ourselves
a
juicy
little
burg
here
just
ripe
for
the
picking
and
i
ain't
in
no
hurry
to
leave
it
you
so
i
figure
what
better
way
to
kick
off
our
semisettlingdown
than
with
a
little
christening
a
symbolic
act
commemorating
the
new
order
around
here
and
ridding
ourselves
of
any
notsopleasant
reminders
of
the
old
all
in
one
quick
really
really
violent
fell
swoop
gentlemen
start
your
engines
byebye
slayer
no
another
one
for
the
fire
boys
tear
it
up
sorry
sorry
it
wasn't
your
fault
we
we
don't
know
if
the
spell
would
have
worked
even
if
the
demons
hadn't
it
would
have
worked
well
maybe
what
maybe
it
wasn't
supposed
to
i
mean
those
demons
showing
up
at
the
exact
wrong
time
maybe
we
really
were
in
over
our
heads
invoking
forces
that
we
have
no
right
to
maybe
the
fates
sent
down
all
that
destruction
on
us
to
stop
us
i
mean
you
mean
maybe
it
was
my
fault
no
no
i'm
not
saying
we
announce
it
this
second
anya
well
i
think
it
would
please
them
to
know
we're
engaged
and
i
think
willow
in
particular
could
use
a
real
moralebooster
right
now
can
we
talk
about
this
later
well
but
it's
just
all
the
excuses
for
not
telling
everyone
we're
engaged
are
gone
now
i
mean
aside
from
hell
bikers
there's
nothing
standing
in
our
way
this
is
it
no
more
surprises
watch
it
it
it's
the
buffy
bot
ah
peachy
no
doubt
to
lead
the
wild
bunch
right
to
us
again
hey
will
next
time
this
thing's

stupid
xander
our

resurrection
spell
worked
like
a
magic
charm
we
brought
you
back
to
life
buffy

uh
here's
some
good
news
that
might
perk
you
right
up

big

actually
be
looking
to
eat
some
brains
so
i
think
a
little
quiet
moseying
no
hard
feelings
and
i'm
sure
your
demon
horde
won't
think
any
the
less
of
you
now
my
boys
see
that's
tricky
they
came
looking
for
a
massacre

exactly
enough
magic
between
you
for
a
kiddie
birthday
party
then
you'd
be
wrong
whoa

of
my
boys

some
anatomical
incompatibilities
that
