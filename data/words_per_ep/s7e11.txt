walks
forward
between

to
the

terminal
building

the

looks
at

across

the

runs
her
finger
down
through
the
names
searching
before
she
realizes
that
the
page
she
needs
has
been
torn
out
of
the
book
when
she
looks
up
from
the
book
she
sees
a
blackrobed
hooded
eyeless
man
approaching
her
she
drops
the
phone
book
and
turns
to
run
but
sees
two
more
of
these
men
the
bringers
coming
toward
her
with
knives
in
their
hands
she
backs
up
against
the
wall
panicked
and
breathing
heavily
and
sinks
down
to
the
ground
just
then
the
pair
of
bringers
between
the
buses
are
lifted
off
the
ground
and
go
flying
apart
revealing
buffy
who
had
thrown
them
to
the
ground
the
third
bringer
runs
away
while
the
two
buffy
attacked
come
back
for
more
one
lunges
at
her
with
his
knife
but
buffy
grabs
his
hand
and
stabs
the
other
bringer
with
the
knife
he's
holding
the
stabbed
bringer
doubles
over
in
pain
and
buffy
kicks
him
to
the
ground
buffy
continues
to
wrestle
with
the
other
bringer
ultimately
breaking
his
neck
buffy
then
sees
the
one
who
started
running
away
and
calls
out
to
him
buffy
yells

hurls
the
knife
at

fleeing
bringer
landing
it
in

back
stabbing
him
through
the
heart

with
one
arm
bent
at
the
elbow
propping
her
head
up
on
her

but
since

the
coven
searching

kennedy
moves
the
arm
that
was
propping
her
head
flips
her
long
brown
hair
and
snuggles
her
face
into

crowded
around
here
kennedy
props
her
head
on
her

a
halfsister

and
a
tall
skinny
redhead

scampering
off

could've
stopped
it
i
mean
the
super
vampire
messed

still
looked
like
a
big
bruise
when
i

already
like
the
day
after
and
why
isn't
she
back

but
he's
not

no
way
we'll
be
able
to
help
spike

the
way
spike

confused

vampire

the
one

town
is
that
avenue

anya
emphatically
i
told
you

whwhat
is
botox's
eye
beljoxa's
eye

an
oracle
type
creature
that
exists
in
a
dark
dimension
internal
vortex
more
like
fun
not
really
no
the
point
is
only
demons

open
the
gateway

friends
in
the
fold
murderous
acquaintances
anyway
anya
to
buffy

beljoxa's
eye
will
have
any
of
the
answers

looking
for
i'll
take
anything
i
can
get

please
we're
running
out
of
time
spike's
running
out
of
time
cut
to
13
int
underground
cave
day
spike
still
beaten
and
scarred
from
his
torture
by
the
first
has
his
back
to
the
rocky
surface
of
the
cave
from
the
close
up
shot
it
looks
as
though
he's
lying
on
the
ground
with
his
hands
on
either
side
of
his
head
pan
out
and
rotate
the
angle
to
show
that
he
is
indeed
chained
upright
to
the
rocky
cave
wall
his
wrists
shackled
a
bringer
comes
toward
spike
with
a
knife
in
hand
as
the
bringer
lunges
at
spike
with
the
knife
spike
shifts
his
body
weight
from
his
feet
to
his
hands
as
he
lifts
his
legs
up
and
uses
his
feet
to
break
the
neck
of
the
bringer
spike
seems
strong
and
energetic
compared
to
when
last
he
appeared
another
bringer
approaches
him
wielding
a
fiery
torch
and
spike
rips
his
hands
free
of
his
shackles
ducking
the
torch
as
the
bringer
swings
it
at
him
spike
kicks
the
bringer
knocking
him
out
then
starts
to
run
out
of
the
cave
as
he
gets
halfway
through
the
passageway
he
sees
someone
ahead
walking
toward
him
he
considers
going
back
but
pauses
to
see
who
it
is
it's
buffy—whiteshirted
sweetly
smiling
buffy
spike
smiles
and
leans
forward—
spike's
head
falls
forward
as
a
blackshirted
buffy
addresses
him
he's
still
shackled
to
the
cave
wall
first
buffy
pacing
in
front
of
him
dreaming
of
me
again
aren't
you
poor
spike
he
still
thinks
i
believe
in
him
be
realistic
i
don't
even
believe
in
myself
first
buffy
stops
pacing
at
least
not
enough
to
risk
my
skin
to
save
your
ass
not
enough
to
face
first
buffy
turns
to
the
turokhan
that
first
buffy
turns
back
to
spike
i'm
sorry
spike
but
you
need
to
accept
this
you
know
it
never
would've
worked
out
you
need
to
let
go
so
we
can
both
move
on
i
promise
soon
it'll
all
be—
buffyfirst
notices
that
spike's
eyes
are
closed
and
he's
muttering
to
himself
she
walks
up
to
him
getting
right
in
his
face
she
will
come
for
me
she
will
come
for
me
she
will
come
for
me
buffyfirst
puts
her
hand
up
to
spike's
face
and
traces
it
without
touching
him
smiling
sweetly
then
she
stops
puts
a
finger
in
front
of
his
lips
and
stares
him
in
the
eye
buffy
matteroffactly
no
i
won't
cut
to
14
ext
alley
behind
a
strip
mall
day
someone's
emptying
a
garbage
can
into
a
dumpster
why
not
you
have
the
nerve
to
ask
me
that
come
on
torg
that
was
like
a
lifetime
ago
torg
puts
down
the
trash
can
he's
holding
to
reveal
his
horribly
disfigured
demon
face
he's
built
like
a
biker
with
a
large
muscular
body
and
long
stringy
hair
but
his
hairline
is
unusual—a
long
zigzag
pattern
along
the
crown
of
his
head
he's
also
got
a
barbed
wire
tattoo
over
his
ear
where
there's
no
hair
his
eyes
are
an
odd
color
and
his
face
is
red
and
creased
like
he's
been
scarred
from
fights
his
ears
are
oversized
and
pointed
he's
pierced
everywhere—nose
brow
ears
plus
he's
got
a
goatee
and
a
few
whiskers
along
his
jaw
line
three
but
who's
counting
you
broke
my
heart
anyanka
don't
be
so
dramatic
torg
you
don't
even
have
a
heart
anya
laughs
six
spleens
two
stomachs
half
a
brain
maybe
but
no
heart
don't
mock
this
the
night
we
spent
together
wasimportant
to
me
it
was
one
date
and
it
wasn't
even
a
date
anya
giles
rolls
his
eyes
we
just
happened
to
be
invited
to
the
same
massacre
and—and
you
hit
on
me
after
i
had
a
few
i
remember
you
wore
pink
those
were
entrails
i'm
sorry
perhaps
we
could
skip
the
nostalgia—
giles
anya
glares
at
him
sorry
no
no
carry
on
ok
torg
look
you
open
this
tiny
little
gateway
to
the
beljoxa's
eye
for
me
and
i'll—

and
i
will
go—
anya
sighs
i'll
have
sex
with
you
again
ugh

human
the
way

look
now
i
wouldn't
touch
you
for
all
the
kittens
in
korea
you're
rejecting
my
offer
of
sexual
bribery
anya
to
giles
what
am
i
a
leper
in
this
town
i
can't
even
give
it
away
torg
grabs
his
garbage
can
and
starts
walking
back
inside
come
back
when
you
are
a
leper
giles
steps
in
front
of
torg
um
perhaps
this
might
change
your
mind
you
help
us
and
the
slayer
won't
kill
your
clientele
and
burn
your
establishment
to
the
ground
torg
glares
at
anya
then
at
giles
he
puts
his
fist
in
front
of
giles's
face
then

that's
gotten
more
than
a
little
ripe
buffy

few
feet
away
from

here
to

you
if
you
try
anything
try
to
run—
did
you
ever
see
the
movie
misery
six
times
but
the

the
movie
'cause
instead
of
crushing
his
foot
with
a
sledge
hammer
kathy
bates
chops

andrew

the
day
before
yesterday
she's
at
the
sun
spot
motel
near
the
highway
the
day
before
yesterday
why
are
we
just
finding
out
about
it
now
bringers
killed
her
watcher
before
he
could
tell
anyone
he
sent
her
if
it
wasn't
for
a
particularly
powerful
seer
in
the
coven
we
wouldn't
even
know
about
it
now
ok
i
mean
buffy
looks
out
the
window
there's
still
a
couple
of
hours
of
daylight
left
you
guys
should
be
safe
here
i'll
get
her
and
bring
her
back
buffy
turns
to
leave
i'll
go
with
you
xander
follows
buffy
andrew
stands
all
right
retrieving
a
potential
let's
do
it
andrew
buffy
and
xander
turn
to
glare
at
him
or
i
could
just
go
wash
up
buffy
and
xander
leave
through
the
front
door
dawn
walks
in
from
the
kitchen
dawn
to
willow
where
are
they
going
bring
another
newbie
in
from
the
cold
another
one
well
the
more
the
better
i
figure
we
need
all
the
help
we
can
get
help
sure
that's
cool
but—
what
i'm
just
not
sure
more
scared

at
buffy's
house
day
the
slayersintraining
that
are
staying
at
buffy's
house
are
training
in
the
basement
there's
equipment
there
for
them
to
use
and
ample
space
for
working
out
the
redheaded
girl
is
stretching
molly
is
juggling
stakes
kennedy
is
holding
the
punching
bag
for
chloe
rona
and
eve
are
standing
on
the
sidelines
watching
them
eve
shrugs
what—what
are
we
all
doing
here
it's
called
training
didn't
your
watcher
ever
teach
you
the
word
i
never
had
a
watcher
i
only
just
found
out
what
i
was—or
what
i
might
be—after
those
crazyass
monks
came
after
me
i
meant
why
are
we
all
bothering
it's
not
like
we
can
make
a
difference
eve
kennedy
rolls
her
eyes
we've
gotta
try
molly
juggling
stakes
we
gotta
keep
our
reflexes
sharp
molly
drops
a
stake
we
have
to
be
ready
if
something
comes
down—
no
something's
already
come
down
she's
right
and
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
it
i
mean
i've
never
seen
a
real
vampire
in
my
whole
life
much
less
slayed
one
i've
seen
one
vi
the
girls
turn
to
look
at
her
well
my
watcher
once
showed
me
a
photograph
of
one
vi
beat
a
blurry
photograph
eve
gestures
toward
her
that's
what
i'm
saying
not
one
of
us
is
remotely
prepared
to
be
activated
as
a
new
chosen
one
kennedy
shrugs
confidently
i
feel
pretty
prepared
excuse
the
newness
of
me
but
uh
just
so
i
understand
if
a
slayer
dies—
well
when
the
slayer
dies
i
mean
nobody
lives
forever
right
then
one
of
us—
get's
activated
uhhuh
i
prefer
called
i
heard
there's
more
than
one
more
than
one
what
slayer
there's
another
one—somewhere
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
like
any
of
this
does
no
matter
how
many
there
are
one
of
us
is
gonna
be
the
next
slayer
with
the
weight
of
the
world
on
her
shoulders
chloe
shakes
her
head
it
won't
be
me
i
mean
not
now
i
mean
i'm
too
young
doesn't
work
that
way
in
fact
the
younger
the
better
in
fact
i'm
starting
to
think
it
might
be
too
late
for
me
never
too
late
it
could
be
anyone
especially
since
there's
so
few
of
us
left
they'll
just
run
through
each
one
of
us
one
after
the
other
kinda
creepy
huh
all
we
do
is
wait
around
for
each
other
to
die

buffy
kicks

followed
by

she
sees
a

lying
on

down
in

she's
cold
been
dead
for
days
poor
kid
she
made
it
all
the

are
all
sitting
on
the
floor
in
a
circle
with
despondent
looks
on
their
faces

can
protect
us

ok
here's
another
interesting
thing
how
come
the
slayer's
always
a
girl
i
dunno
'cause
girls
are
cooler
i
think
a
guy
slayer
would
be
badass
like—like
if
there
was
this
ninja
a
guy
slayer
would
be
like
andrew
holds
up
his
hand
in
a
karate
pose
and
puts
on
a
voice
you
may
be
silent
but
this'll
shut
you
up
andrew
does
a
karate
move
hiya
buffy
could
stomp
ninja
ass
dawn
walks
to
another
desk
the
silent
warrior
ha
ha—i
think
not
she
can't
even
slay
that
special
vampire
andrew
dawn
glares
andrew
shrugs
everyone's
saying
well
everyone
should
shut
up
and
you
should
stop
pretending
anybody
here
is
your
friend
and
also
why's
she
so
about
saving
spike
he's
a
worse
killer
than
me
by
a
way
lot
spike
was
being
controlled
by
the
first
and
he
has
a
soul
now
besides
we
need
his
help
what
about
me
did
it
ever
occur
to
anyone
that
i
could
be
a
lot
more
useful
around
here
i
used
to
be
an
evil
genius
hello
dawn
walks
up
to
him

your
genius
thing

um
raising

andrew
timidly
not

dawn
cocks
her
head
to
the
side
even
license

andrew
nods
pretty
cool
you
know
timothy
dalton

the
end
of
an
old

it
goin'
on
he
went
rogue
with
the
broccolis
they

shakes
head
is
there
a
language
that
you're
speaking
andrew
pouts

before
the

was
born
long
after
there
is
nothing
else
it
will
go
on
i
refuse
to
believe
that
there
must
be
some
way
to
destroy
it
what
am
i
talking
to
myself
here
there's
no
way
ok
we
tried
let's
go
giles
anya
starts
to
walk
away
are
you
saying
that
the
first
will
succeed
in—in
wiping
out
the
line
of
slayers
the
eye
sees
not
the
future
only
the
truth
of
the
now
and
before
yes
we've
all
got
that—it's
called
memory
can
you
help
us
out
with
something
a
little
bit
more
demony
if
the
first
has
been
around
for
all
time
then
why
hasn't
it
attempted
something
like
this
before
why
now
the
opportunity
has
only
recently
presented
itself
opportunity
the
mystical
forces
surrounding
the
chosen
line
have
become
irrevocably
altered
become
unstable
vulnerable
something
the
first
did
the
first
evil
did
not
cause
the
disruption
only
seized
upon
it
to
extinguish
the
lives
of
the
chosen
forever
then
what
has
caused
the
disruption
what—what
is
responsible
for
letting
this
happen

opposite
her
we
should
run
and
go
where
vi
annabelle
ran
look
where
it
got
her
safer
in
than
out
how
can
you
say
that
it
was
here
buffy
in
the
house
living
with
us
for
days
and
you
didn't
even
know
it
well
none
of
us
knew
it
it
could
still
be
here
it
could
be
any
one
of
us
no
the
first
can
only
take
the
form
of
dead
people
yeah
well
there'll
be
plenty
more
of
those
soon
enough
we're
dropping
like
flies
here
all
the
girls
start
talking
over
one
another
hey
buffy
the
girls
stop
talking

i
know
you're
all
scared
you
know
what
i
am
too
but

hopefully
they
will
have
the
information
that
we
need
to
stop
the
first
in
the
mean
time
we
need
to
stick
together
ok
we're
stronger
that
way
we
cannot
afford
to
fall
apart
now
andrew
steps
up
to
the
table
she's
right
where
would
the
justice
league
have
been
if
they
hadn't
put
their
differences
aside
to
stop
the
imperium
and
his
shapeshifting
alien
horde
andrew
crosses
his
arms
buffy
sneers
to
andrew
don't
help
me
buff
the
sun
goes
down
and
ubervamp's
on
its
way
so
a
plan'd
be
good
right
about
now
will
i'm
sorry
to
ask
but—
i
know
we
need
a
barrier
a
major
one
something
tells
me
this
vampire
doesn't
need
an
invite
to
get
into
the
house
can
you
do
it
i'll
try
try
you
heard
her
buff
are
you
sure
about
willow
doing
the
hocus
pocus
again
i—i
mean
last
time
she—
xander
we
don't
have
a
lot
of
choices
and
what
if
that
doesn't
work
what
if
that
monster
gets
through
then
we'll
deal
deal
fight
you
mean
how
are
we
supposed
to
do
that
and
with
what
kennedy
to
the
slayersintrianing
with
whatever
it
takes
kennedy
looks
at
buffy
right
buffy
you
fought
the
turokhan
and
it
almost
killed
you
and
you're
the
real
slayer
whwhat
chance
do
we
have
honestly
you
staked
that
thing
and
it
didn't
die
no
but
that
doesn't—
maybe
it
can't
be
killed
while
the
girls
go
on
about
this
buffy's
just
staring
straight
ahead
with
her
arms
crossed
willow's
staring
off
into
the
distance
then

it
i
get
it
but
this
isn't
the
best
venue
for
a
smackdown
we
can
whine
like
little
wusses
or
we
can
get
off
our
asses
and
fight
i
know
just
the
place
back
at
the
construction
site
buffy
is
still
fighting
the
turokhan
it
punches
buffy
to
the
ground
but
she
gets
back
up
to
fight
more
it
throws
her
about
20
feet
away
and
she
lands
on
the
scaffolds
knocking
the
crossbow
out
of
kennedy's
hands
buffy
picks
up
the
weapon
and
aims
it
at
the
turokhan
and
fires
as
it
runs
toward
her
hitting
it
right
in
the
heart
it
only
pauses
for
a
moment
then
comes
at
her
again
buffy
grabs
a
nearby
pipe
from
the
scaffolding
and
uses
it
as
a
staff
she
then
uses
it
to
propel
herself
away
from
the
fight
but
the
turokhan
is
right
behind
her
she
grabs
a
pickaxe
and
swings
it
at
the
turokhan
but
it
ducks
and
pushes
her
into
the
wall
of
the
construction
office
trailer
buffy
falls
to
the
ground
and
the
turokhan
disarms
her
before
throwing
her
back
toward
the
center
of
the
open
area
it
punches
her
again
and
again
she
falls
into
a
pile
of
cinder
blocks
but
picks
one
up
to
throw
at
the
turokhan—but
it
crushes
it
before
she
can
throw
it
it
punches
her
again
and
kicks
her
under
some
scaffolding
before
throwing
her
a
dozen
feet
into
the
air
through
the
scaffold
platform
buffy
manages
to
stay
on
the
platform
and
the
turokhan
scales
the
scaffolding
to
get
to
her
he
grabs
her
by
the
throat
lifting
her
off
the
ground
and
choking
her
as
she
struggles
against
him
it's
killing
her
we
have
to
do
something
wait
buffy
reaches
down
grabs
the
arrow
in
the
turokhan's
chest
pulls
it
out
and
jabs
its
eye
it
roars
and
drops
buffy
while
it's
dealing
with
its
injury
buffy
starts
punching
it
and
kicks
it
to
the
ground
where
it
lands
in
a
pile
of
cinder
blocks
and
boards
weakly
it
tries
to
punch
her
back
but
she
keeps
punching
and
kicking
it
until
finally
she
can
bang
its
head
into
the
metal
scaffolding
buffy
grabs
some
nearby
barbed
wire
and
slips
it
around
the
turokhan's
throat
it
falls
to
the
ground
and
buffy
pulls
on
it
hard
enough
to
sever
its
head
the
turokhan
explodes
in
a
cloud
of
dust
in
front
of
her
see
dust
just
like
the
rest
of
'em
i
don't
know
what's
coming
next
but
i
do
know
it's
gonna
be
just
like
this
hard
painful
but

standing
on
the
scaffolding
scowling
and
glaring
as

someone
walking
toward
him

is
standing

approaches
him
slowly
and
cuts
him
loose
of
his
tethers
he
collapses
forward
and
braces
himself
with
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
when
he
touches
her
and
realizes
she's
real
he
smiles
and
squints
searching
her
face
intently
she
looks
into
his
eyes
tapping
an
emotional
connection
between
them
you
oh
he
puts
his
arm
over
her
shoulder
and
she
puts
her
arm
around
his
waist
although
spike
is
weak
and
limping
they
walk
out

cave
together
