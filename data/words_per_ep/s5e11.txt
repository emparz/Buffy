exterior
shot
of
xander's
apartment
building
night
cut
to
xander
lying
in
bed
staring
at
the
ceiling
you
ever
have
that
feeling
where
there's
something
you
know
you're
supposed
to
do
and
you
forgot
what
it
was
we
see
anya
lying
next
to
him
she
thinks
about
it
nope
i've
been
having
that
feeling
i
just
realized
what
it
was
xander
looks
at
anya
like
three
weeks
ago
riley
asked
me
to
borrow
a
crescent
wrench
xander
shakes
his
head
i
keep
having
this
feeling
like
i'm
supposed
to
give
it
to
him
well
that's
not
going
to
happen
unless
he
comes
back
you
know
not
to
get
the
crescent
wrench
just
to
come
back
i
just
mean
sometimes
i
sort
of
forget
that
he's
gone
it's
like
where's
riley
oh
wait
the
central
republic
of
whereinthehell
anya
softly
xander
he
looks
at
her
we
see
they're
holding
hands
if
you
ever
decide
to
go
i
want
a
warning
you
know
big
flashing
red
lights
andandand
one
of
those
clocks
that
counts
down
like
a
bomb
in
a
movie
and
there's
a
whole
bunch
of
of
colored
wires
and
i'm
not
sure
which
is
the
right
one
to
cut
but
i
guess
the
green
one
and
then
at
the
last
second
no
the
red
one
and
then
click
it
stops
with
threetenths
of
a
second
left
but
then
you
don't
leave
anya
pause
like
that
okay
check
big
bomb
clock
xander
she
smiles
come
here
he
puts
his
arm
around
her
and
she
moves
to
put
her
head
on
his
chest
maybe
it's
her
huh
well
maybe
it
won't
happen
to
us
because
it's
all
about
her
messing
things
up
she
couldn't
make
it
work
with
angel
and
then
she
let
riley
go
away
yeah
relationship
debris
is
kind
of
piling
up
on
the
buffy
highway
hmm
humans
make
the
same
mistakes
over
and
over
i
saw
it
when
i
was
a
vengeance
demon
some
guy
dumps
a
girl
she
calls
me
i
exact
vengeance
blah
blah
blah
the
next
year
same
girl
different
guy
i
mean
after
you
smite
a
few
of
'em
you
start
going
my
goodness
young
lady
maybe
you're
doing
something
wrong
here
too
i
don't
think
it's
a
pattern
with
her
no
it's
just
you
know
now
that
it
happened
again
man
number
two
i
wonder
how
she's
dealing
with
it
cut
to
a
courtyard
filled
with
nuns
the
camera
follows
one
of
them
whom
we
only
see
from
the
back
she
has
a
blonde
curl
of
hair
sticking
out
from
under
her
habit
suddenly
a
vampire
appears
behind
her
backing
away
from
something
he
bumps
into
the
nun
turns
around
and
grabs
her
holds
her
in
front
of
him
the
nun
screams
the
vampire
pushes
her
aside
as
buffy
runs
up
and
kicks
him
in
the
face
he
falls
backward
flips
upright
again
buffy
kicks
him
again
they
continue
fighting
as
the
nun
watches
in
amazement
buffy
hits
the
vampire
he
kicks
buffy
twice
then
she
hits
him
a
few
times
kicks
him
a
few
times
and
thrusts
with
her
stake
but
he
grabs
her
arm
and
pushes
her
away
buffy
ducks
as
he
leaps
at
her
then
she
straightens
up
and
stakes
him
buffy
tosses
the
stake
aside
and
goes
to
the
nun
who
is
still
on
the
ground
what
what
what
was
that
he
looked
like
a
a
demon
yeah
he
did
are
you
okay
yeah
i
think
so
here
buffy
helps
the
nun
get
up
so
um
aabout
being
a
nun
buffy
they
begin
to
walk
along
together
you
know
um
with
the
whole
abjuring
the
company
of
men
you
know
how's
that
working
for
you
the
abjuring
nun
confused
um

you

you
have
to
be
like
superreligious

sternly

drool
she
resumes
hitting

pouring
himself
a
glass
of
water
thank

much
buffy

information
that

possibly
lead
them
to
dawn
buffy
she
comes
over
and
sits
on
a
bench
giles
sits
next
to
her
truly
buffy
if
i
saw
an
alternative
if

buff
pretty
standard
vampire
staking
ooh

a
nun
and
she
let
me
try
on
her
wimple
okay
now
we're
back
to
frightening
cut
to
exterior
of
the
summers
house
night
cut
to
joyce's
bedroom
a
lightblue
bathrobe
lies
on
the
bed
buffy
enters
sees
it
frowns
looks
up
you
we
see
joyce
wearing
a
striped
sweater
and
dark
pants
she
has
a
scarf
over
part
of
her
head
you
with
the
actual
clothing
who
are
you
buffy
turns
toward
dawn's
bedroom
door
dawn
come
look
at
this
it's
hard
to
recognize
me
huh
dawn
enters
whoa
no
more
bathrobe
hmm
i
looked
at
it
today
and
there
it
was
all
fuzzy
and
blue
joyce
shot
of
the
bathrobe
and
i
just
couldn't
stand
it
any
more
i
don't
think
the
rest
of
us
will
miss
it
much
either
it
was
getting
a
little
ripe
mom
buffy
to
dawn
maybe
we
should
burn
it
it
would
keep
the
bugs
away
it
doesn't
smell
fine
fine
make
your
funny
jokes
at
the
expense
of
the
woman
with
the
hole
in
her
skull
joyce
sits
on
the
bed
buffy
to
dawn
let's
go
i
think
we've
tired
her
out
buffy
goes
into
her
room
dawn
follows
joyce
watches
them
with
a
smile
then
leans
back
and
sighs
buffy
walks
into
her
room
sits
on
the
bed
and
begins
flipping
through
a
magazine
dawn
stands
in
the
doorway
watching
whatcha
doin'
playing
soccer
can
i
hang
out
in
here
don't
touch
anything
dawn
comes
into
the
room
looks
at
a
corkboard
where
several
photos
are
hanging
you
took
down
his
pictures
yeah
i
i
think
i
would've
done
that
sooner
like
boom
don't
wanna
see
that
face
again
it
wasn't
like
that
i
was
never
angry
with
him
buffy
sighs
okay
that's
a
lie
but
it's
not
like
i
don't
want
to
see
his
face
i
was
just
starting
to
kinda
like
the
guy
and
then
gone
so
fast
it
wasn't
really
so
fast
him
leaving
according
to
everyone
who
isn't
me
it
was
kind
of
gradual
oh
does
that
make
it
any
better
dawn
sits
on
the
end
of
the
bed
no
because
you
should
have
noticed
earlier
stop
being
insightful
it's
creepy
buffy
dawn
continues
looking
at
her
buffy
speaks
more
softly
it
hurts
in
all
kinds
of
horrible
ways
in
the
way
where
i'm
furious
at
him
in
the
way
where
i
blame
myself
and
all
the
little
ways
i
imagine
how
i
could
have
fixed
things
it'll
get
better
dawn
frowns
won't
it
i
hope
so
yes
it
has
to
buffy
dawn
lies
down
puts
her
head
in
buffy's
lap
buffy
strokes
her
hair
i'll
just
keep
going
like
i
have
been
and
every
day
it'll
get
a
little
bit
better
really
every
day
not
really
but
it'll
be
better
soon
it
still
feels
all
sudden
to
me
with
him
gone
where
no
one
can
talk
to
him
but
you
never
know
maybe
he'll
come
back
maybe
he'll
hate
the
jungle
or
maybe
he'll
want
to
give
it
another
try
i
could
say
all
the
things
i
didn't
get
to
say
cut
to
spike
holding
a
box
of
chocolates
he
talks
to
someone
we
can't
see
spike
softly
um
there's
something
i
got
to
tell
you
about
showing
you
riley
in
that
place
spike
deep
breath
i
didn't
mean
to

spike
long
pause
anyway
i
know
you're
feeling
all
betrayed
by
him
not
me
spike
the
camera
pans
around
and
we
see
he
is
talking
to
a
mannequin
which
has
no
legs
but
wears
a
blue
blouse
and
a
blonde
wig
it's
set
up
on
a
block
of
stone
so
that
it
is
about
buffy's
height
i
was
trying
to
help
you
know
not
like
i
made
him
be
there
after
all
actually
trying
to
help
you
best
intentions
he
gets
a
little
agitated
paces
a
few
steps
away
i
mean
you
know
pretty
state
you'd
be
in
thinking
things
are
all
right
spike
moves
back
toward
the
mannequin
while
he's
toddling
halfway
round
the
bend
spike
stares
at
the
mannequin
gets
madder
oh
i'll
insult
him
if
i
want
to
i'm
the
one
who's
on
your
side
me
doing
you
a
favor
spike
very
angry
and
you
being
dead
petty
about
it
me
getting
nothing
but
your
hatred
and
your
venom
and
you
ungrateful
bitch
he
loses
control
of
himself
smashes
the
box
of
chocolates
over
the
mannequin's
head
bitch
he
hits
the
mannequin
with
the
chocolates
again
and
it
falls
over
the
box
of
chocolate
goes
flying
spike
sighs
he
picks
up
the
mannequin
and
replaces
it
he
carefully
rearranges
the
wig
sighs
again
picks
up
the
box
of
chocolate
tries
to
stuff
the
chocolates
back
in
he
composes
himself
and
faces
the
mannequin
again
spike
quietly
buffy
there's
something
i
wanted
to
tell
you
cut
to
magic
shop
anya
is
working
at
the
cash
register
willow
stands
behind
her
with
her
back
to
the
camera
holding
a
book
tara
is
standing
by
the
shelves
behind
the
register
where
there
are
jars
of
magical
supplies

and
and
hellebore
it's
up
and
to
the
right

to
willow
hellebore
one
of
my
favorites
it's
powerful
stuff
willow
she
and
tara
walk
out
from
behind
the
counter
i
tried
to
use
it
to
derat
amy
and
it
didn't
work
but
i
think
it
might
have
made
her
really
smart
willow
they
approach
the
table
where
a
variety
of
magical
supplies
are
laid
out
willow
puts
the
vial
into
a
rack
with
some
others
she
keeps
giving
me
these
looks
like
she's
planning
something
rubbing
her
paws
together
anya
comes
out
from
behind
the
counter
and
walks
over
to
them
anya
annoyed
hey
what
are
you
two
doing
oh
we're
gonna
try
out
a
few
spells

this
thing

there's
a
a
floating

out
the
circle
of

suddenly
drops
down
through
the
glass
of
the
countertop
and
touches
a
large
crystal
that
is
in
the
display
case
underneath
it
gives
off
a
big
flash
of
light
and
a
large
demon
olaf
suddenly
appears
next
to
the
counter
willow
and
anya
shriek
and
grab
each
other
olaf
stumbles
a
bit
gets
his
balance
and

is
about
seven
feet
tall
with
long
hair
and
green
scaly
skin
and
a
big
beard
covering
most
of
his
face
and

curved
horns
on
his
head
he
holds
a
large
hammer

and
willow
stare
in
shock
olaf
looks
at
himself
looks
around
he
turns
and
sees
the
two
girls
and
roars
loudly
they
shriek
again
and
clutch
each
other
olaf
turns
and
uses
his
hammer
to
smash
a
display
case
full
of
merchandise
then
another
growling
all
the
time
then
he
smashes
a
statue
on
a
pedestal
he
goes
to
the
door
and
stumbles
outside
still
roaring
willow
and
anya
come
forward
he's

ball
of
sunshine
blackout

she
and

begin
to
walk
out
into
the
hallway
whole
new
vistas
of

and
intimidated
by
tara
laughs
i
think

kind
of
fun
greek
art's
gonna
touch
on
so
many
things
mythology
history
philosophy
buffy
whispering
the
professor
spit
too
much
when
he
talked
it

like
being
at
sea
world
the
first
five
rows
will
get
wet
tara
laughs
that
was
just
you
know
um
enthusiasm
it
seemed
very
much
like
saliva

sit
farther
back

good
plan
buffy
stops
walking
folds
the
paper
and
puts
it
in
her
bag

only
other
thing
that
fits
into
my
schedule

american
geopolitics
tara
grimaces
hmm

buffy
resumes
walking
i
even
hear
the
word
jungle
all
i
can
think
of
is
him
buffy
tara
looks
sympathetic
you
know
is
that
the
one
riley's
in
really
don't
need
a
daily
200
knife
in
the
heart
is
it
that
bad
buffy
stops
walking
sort
of
but
i'm
starting
to
get
perspective
on
the
whole
situation
you
know
maybe
riley's
where
he's
supposed
to
be
you
know
maybe
he
needed
to
be
where
he
was
needed
willow
says
that
things
always
happen
for
a
reason
but
you
ever
notice
people
only
say
that
about
bad
things
buffy
tara
laughs
but
not
for
me
the
furrowed
brow
buffy
resumes
walking
what
do
you
say
we
go
pick
up
willow
and
indulge
ourselves
in
a
little
afterschool
hamburger
i
guess
we
could
she
might
still
be
at
the
magic
shop
i
was
there
earlier
and
she
and
anya
kinda
got
in
this
little
squabble
xander
and
i
sort
of
cleared
out
he
was
pretty
upset
buffy
stops
walking
looks
very
concerned
anya
and
and
xander
are
in
trouble
oh

ii
said
that
all
wrong
it
was
nothing
willow
and
anya
were
sort
of
fighting
and
then
xander
kind
of
snapped
at
both
of
them
and
he
left
buffy
alarmed
he
left
xander
left
anya
tara
frowning
ummm

her
left
her
he
just
left
it
was
only
a
little
thing

little
thing
buffy
tearfully
see
the
thing
is
the
little
things
get
bigger
you
know
and
and
and
and
if
you
don't
catch
the
little
thing
and
then
boom

whole
huge
thing
oh

buffy
sniffling

them
with
the
little
things

can't
break
up
oh

a
beautiful
love

be
fine
buffy
bursts
into
tears
and
puts
her
face
against
tara's
shoulder
hugging
her
tara
looks
alarmed
pats
buffy
on
the
back
buffy
muffled
they
have
a
miraculous
love
what
buffy
sobbing
a
miraculous
love
cut
to
giles's
convertible
zooming
down
the
streets
of
sunnydale
we
see
another
car
by
the
side
of
the
road
with
its
side
all
smashed
in
there
that
parked
car
we're
still
on
his
trail
we
see
that
anya
is
driving
while
willow
sits
in
the
passenger
seat
holding
a
bunch
of
papers
the
car
screeches
around
a
corner
i
don't
even
get
how
we
made
that
guy
because
wow
advanced
willow
she
continues
looking
through
the
papers
no
one
made
him
he
must
have
been
trapped
in
that
crystal
and
you
released
him
i
released
him
no
this
was
definitely
a
we
thing
or
or
a
you
thing

like
a
you
thing

just
find
the
reversal
spell
and
hurry

what
he
did
to
that
lamppost
we
see
a
lamppost
lying
on
the
ground
broken
in
two
i'm
trying
put
the
top
up
the
pages

all
blowy
well
i
don't

what
the
left
pedal
does
anya
turns
to
smile
at
willow
it
makes
us
stop
anya
slams
on
the
brake
and
they
slow
down
with
a
screech
willow
grabs
the
side
of
the
car
for
balance
anya
resumes
driving
you
don't
know
how
to
drive
why
didn't
you
say
you
don't
know
how
to
drive
well
i
couldn't
know
if
i
could
until
i
tried
could
i
they
exchange
an
angry
look
this
is
very
very
bad
there
there's
an
ogre
on
the
loose
troll
what
troll
on
the
loose
now

i'm
gonna
press
the
right
pedal
harder
anya
smiling
i
expect
us
to
accelerate
she
presses
on
the
gas
pedal
and
they
both
lean
back
in
their
seats
as
the
car
speeds
up
willow
looks
very
angry
willow
yelling
over
the
engine
noise
there's
a
troll
on
the
loose
and
you're
gonna
crash
giles'
car
anya
agreeing
it's
likely
we're
going
very
fast
you
should
have
listened
to
me
and
not
done
the
spell
giles
put
me
in
charge
giles
can
be
an
idiot
the
smart
kind
but
still
xander
agreed
oh
right
xander
doesn't
step
out
of
line
anya
turns
to
look
at
her
well
what
do
you
mean
by
that
nothing
willow
looks
ahead
points
at
something
anya
looks
twists
the
wheel
quickly
the
car
screeches
around
another
corner
narrowly
misses
hitting
another
parked
car
which
has
its
roof
bashed
in
some
of
the
papers
fly
out
of
willow's
hands
and
are
gone
with
the
wind
behind
the
car
willow
watches
them
go
find
that
spell
quickly
whoa
that's
gone
cut
to
interior
of
the
bronze
xander
takes
a
bowl
of
peanuts
from
the
counter
and
turns
away
as
he
walks
away
he
bumps
into
spike
who
is
drinking
a
mug
of
beer
hey
watch
it
spike
looks
at
xander
oh

you
spike

let
me
stop
you
from
not
being
here
i
was
here
first
you
know
uhhuh
go
away
xander
walks
off
spike
grins
and
follows
him
now
why
would
i
do
that
when
it's
bugging
you
so
much
having
me
here
xander
sits
at
a
round
table
and
begins
shelling
the
peanuts
spike
watches
they
have
chicken
wings
too
also
a
sort
of
a
flowershaped
thing
they
make
from
an
onion
it's
brilliant
are
you
talking
to
me
hoping
that
i'll
get
so
depressed
that
i'll
impale
myself
on
a
fork
right
in
front
of
you
lovely
thought
if
i
don't
hurt
you
myself
the
chip
wouldn't
zap
me
i
could
eat
you
that
way
beat
the
onion
thing
all
to
hell
spike
reaches
over
to
take
one
of
xander's
peanuts
xander
slaps
his
hand
away
hey
those
are
mine
my
my
someone's
in
a
temper
spike
sits
down
opposite
xander
this
all
sympathetic
misery
borrowed
from
the
slayer
what
no
nothing
to
do
with
buffy
so
she's
all
right
then
not
uh
holding
grudges
what
are
you
talking
about
what
does
buffy
have
to
do
with
anything
what
grudges
oh
yeah

no
need
to
talk
about
her
then
i'm
sure
she's
merrily
slaying
some
pals
of
mine
having
a
grand
old
time
he
eyes
xander
warily
as
he
takes
another
sip
of
his
beer
this
is
very
bad
cut
to
interior
of
magic
shop
buffy
steps
around
the
broken
debris
lying
on

burn
your
crops
and
make

more
attractive
daughters
ha

mark
my
words
he
pauses
and
sniffs
the
air
ooh

he
walks
off
cut
to
interior
of
the
bronze
spike
and
xander
are
playing
pool
together
and
they
get
in
these
fights
and
they're
both
looking
at
me
like
i'm
the
referee
also
sometimes
i'll
say
something
about
anya
and
willow'll
get
this
look
this
um
what
the
hell
do
you
see
in
her
look
i
know
that
look
lot
of
people
never
really
got
dru
you
know
well
she
was
insane
xander
spike
looks
offended
then
it's
like
well
i
get
all
torn
because
willow's
my
best
friend
and
i
really
value
her
opinion
but
uh
anya's
my
girlfriend
you
know
hmm
what
does
the
slayer
think
of
all
this
friction
in
the
ranks
spike
walks
around
the
pool
table
to
study
the
angles
can't
be
good
for
morale
i
don't
know
spike
bitterly
she's
a
little
preoccupied
maybe
it's
understandable
what
with
all
the
upset
all
the
blaming
of
innocent
bystanders
who
got
caught
up
in
the
mess
what
spike
walks
closer
to
xander
i
mean
did
she
want
to
be
made
a
fool
of
and
what
does
a
person
have
to
do
to
make
it
right
spike
olaf
walks
past
bumping
spike's
shoulder
hey
watch
it
mate
spike
turns
to
look
up
at
olaf
both
he
and
xander
stare
on
second
thought
do
what
you
like
olaf
sniffs
the
air
ale

walks
over
to
where
a
guy
is
wheeling
a
dolly
with
two
halfkegs
on
it
ah
fragrant
ale
olaf
picks
up
a
keg
with
one
hand
lifts
it
to
his
mouth
and
begins
to
drink
xander
still
standing
behind
spike
so
uh
think
i
should
run
and
get
buffy
olaf
finishes
off
the
keg
sighs
happily
and
tosses
it
aside
he
looks
around
at
the
patrons
staring
at
him
in
fear
he
spots
a
waitress
barmaid
bring
me
stronger
ale
and
some
plump
succulent
babies
to
eat
i'm
gonna
run
and
get
buffy
xander
pats
spike
on
the
shoulder
or
maybe
you
could
fight
him
yeah

could
do
that
but
i'm
paralyzed
with
not
caring
very
much
olaf
pointing
at
spike
you
there
olaf
walks
up
to
spike
and
xander

toward

witch

stop
willow
quickly

far
from

as
long
as

olaf
pauses
looks
down
at
himself
nothing
happens
he
begins
to
laugh
willow
flips
pages
frantically
olaf
laughs
it
did
not
work
okay
wait
uh
let
the
conjuring
olaf
lunges
forward
but
buffy
kicks
him
in
the
chest
as
she
drives
him
back
kicking
and
punching
spike
follows
right
behind
her
buffy
ducks
a
punch
and
spike
prepares
to
punch
olaf
himself
but
gets
caught
by
a
swinging
arm
and
goes
flying
aside
buffy
seizes
olaf
and
shoves
him
down
on
a
pool
table
they
both
grapple
for
his
hammer
olaf
shoves
buffy
and
she
goes
flying
backward
into
spike
who
had
just
gotten
up
they
both
fall
down
again
olaf
gets
up
from
the
pool
table
and
begins
smashing
the
pillars
that
hold
up
the
mezzanine
level
of
the
bronze
people
scream
and
run
buffy
is
on
the
floor
on
top
of
spike
she
tries
to
get
up
and
spike
acts
like
he's
helping
her
but
actually
he's
hindering
by
clutching
her
around
the
waist
finally
she
gets
to
her
feet
and
rushes
off
spike
watches
her
go
with
a
smirk
olaf
continues
smashing
pillars
as
people
run
around
screaming
xander
and
anya
cower
in
a
corner
olaf
smashes
another
pillar
and
the
entire
upper
level
of
the
bronze
comes
crashing
down
bringing
people
and
tables
with
it
buffy
covers
her
head
with
her
hands
as
the
debris
falls
on
her
some
of
the
people
manage
to
cling
to
the
railings
dangling
in
the
air
but
then
they
lose
their
grips
and
fall
to
the
floor
below
blackout
act
iii

fade
back
in
on
the
bronze
a
large
piece
of
wood
is
pinning
buffy
down
and
she
lifts
it
off
her
as
tara
helps
spike
runs
up
and
holds
the
thing
out
of
the
way
so
buffy
can
get
up
she
rushes
over
to
willow
xander
and
anya
standing

nods
anya

who
is
trying
to
move
some
debris
off
a
pair
of
injured
people
buffy
helps
clear
the
stuff
away
and
they
check
on
the

crouching
next
to
another

buffy
walks
away
spike
looks
after
her
in

sighs
continues
helping
the
injured

puts
them
on
the
table
anya
approaches
from
the
counter
her
arms
full
of
supplies
in
case
we
need
'em
i'm
getting
more
of
all
the
things

that
what
anya
goes
back
to
the
counter
for
more
stuff
you're
so
rude

the
rules
anya
putting
more
stuff
on
table
rules
are
stupid
great
whatever
willow
they

sit
down
and
open
books
i
just
thought
you
might
be
interested
in
learning
to
act
more
human
some
of
us
enjoy
it
oh
look
for
uh
spells
with
dimensional
portals
too
i
am
a
human
and
there
are
many
humans
who
are
stranger
than
me
uhhuh
but
unless
i'm
really
wrong
about
crazy
larry
down
at
the
bus
stop
he's
probably
not
gonna
turn
xander
into
a
troll
well
now
that's
a
very
complicated
proced
anya
pauses
oh
you
think
i'm
gonna
hurt
xander
i
would
never
hurt
xander
anya
willow
looks
skeptical
you
really
think
i
would
do
that
anya
it's
what
you
do
you
spent
what
a
thousand
years
hurting
men
you
got
your
thousand
years
of
hurting
men
gold
watch
i
was
a
demon
then
and
and
i
don't
even
have
any
powers
now
is
this
the
spell
anya
holds
a
book
up
willow
looks
only
if
you
want
him
to
double
in
size
and
grow
extra
arms
which
let's
not
aand
by
the
way
you
weren't
a
demon
when
you
turned
olaf
into
lord
of
the
hammers
you
managed
that
willow
anya
continues
looking
at
the
book
also
there's
other
ways
to
hurt
xander
i
don't
do
magic
now
you're
the
one
with
that
kind
of
power
in
fact
d'hoffryn
offered
you
my
old
job
you're
closer
to
being
a
vengeance
demon
than
i
am
maybe
xander
should
be
afraid
of
you
xander's
my
best
friend
oh
and
you
don't
want
anyone
else
to
have
him
i

it
was
you
and
your

and
poison
his

not
gonna
take
him

smiles
proudly
rushes
out
from
behind
the
counter
shot
of
buffy
and
olaf
exchanging
blows
hey
olaf
you're
as
inadequate
a
troll
as
you
were
a
boyfriend
olaf
looks
over
at
her
with
an
angry
grunt
buffy
lands
another
blow
anya
looks
back
at
willow
who
gives
her
the
thumbsup
anya
looks
back
at
olaf
uh
yyou're
hairy
and
unattractive
and
even
women
trolls
are
put
off
by
your
various
odors

olaf's
hammer
glows
green
for
a
moment
he
lifts
buffy
by
the
throat
your
menacing
stance
is
merely
alarming
olaf
hits
buffy
in
the
upper
arm
with
his
hammer
and
flings
her
aside
to
land
against
a
wall
and
your
roar
is
less
than
fullthroated
desist
olaf
stomps
toward
anya
my
god
woman
it's
been
a
thousand
years
and
yet
you
are
as
aggravating
and
emasculating
as
ever
you
were
he
swings
the
hammer
at
anya
she
ducks

olaf's
hammer
glows
green
again
and
flies
out
of
his
hand
as
he
tries
to
swing
it
at
anya
it
lands
on
the
floor
and
stops
glowing
olaf
stares
at
his
hands
buffy
gets
up
anya
goes
over
to
willow
hey
good
job
you
too
very
irritating
buffy
confronting
olaf
so
your
power's
in
your
hammer
she
rushes
at
him
he
backhands
her
and
she
flies
across
the
room
again
landing
next
to
xander
anya
calls
to
buffy
oh
yeah
i
forgot
he
still
has
all
that
troll
strength
buffy
gets
up
helps
xander
up
you
shall
all
die
i
will
dispense
no
mercy
now
buffy
punches
him
in
the
face
then
again
then
a
third
time
she
grabs
his
arm
and
twists
it
up
behind
his
back
he
grunts
loudly
and
throws
her
off
she
lands
on
the
floor
again
what
are
you
fighting
for
minuscule
blonde
one
your
friends
olaf
gestures
to
anya
comforting
xander
these
two
olaf
chuckles
they
will
never
last
olaf
buffy's
lower
lip
begins
to
tremble
anyanka
is
very
difficult
to
live
with
and
he
olaf
we
see
willow
and
anya
both
comforting
xander
he's
ludicrous
and
far
too
breakable
their
love
will
never
last
buffy
looks
on
the
verge
of
tears
she
gives
a
sad
little
whimper
then
she
jumps
to
her
feet
flips
over
olaf's
head
he
bends
over
and
she
flips
herself
across
his
back
spins
and
kicks
him
in
the
chest
shot
of
willow
xander
and
anya
watching
as
buffy
drives
olaf
across
the
room
she's
got
him
now
anya
nods
then
turns
her
attention
to
xander's
broken
wrist
poor
baby
they
all
watch
buffy
driving
olaf
back
in
the
other
direction
you
really
dated
him
anya
grimaces
yes
but
you
like
me
better
right
anya
smiles
yes
oh
and
willow
likes
you
too
but
not
in
a
sexy
way
you
know
'cause
she's
gay
anya
willow
smiles
at
xander
and
she's
not
gonna
try
to
break
us
up
so
you
know
it's
all
okay
they
all
turn
to
look
at
the
fighting
again
buffy
os
their
love
buffy
punching
noise
olaf
grunts
will
last

buffy
punch
grunt
forever
buffy
punch
sound
of
olaf
falling
to
the
floor
shot
of
olaf
lying
unconscious
on
the
floor
shot
of
willow
looking
down
at
him
let
the
transposition
be
complete
olaf
dissolves
into
nothing
and
disappears
willow
smiles
hugely
shot
of
tara
watching
buffy
os
where
did
you
send
him
anya
os
the
land
of
the
trolls
we
see
them
all
standing
around
in
the
magic
shop
he'll
like
it
there
full
of
trolls
it's
hard
to
be
precise
though
alternate
universes
don't
stay
put
trying
to
send
him
to
a
specific
place
is
sort
of
like
like
trying
to
hit
a
puppy
by
throwing
a
live
bee
at
it
willow
they
all
look
at
her
which
is
a
weird
image
and
you
should
all
just
forget
it
it's
possible
that
he's
in
the
land
of
perpetual
wednesday
or
the
crazy
melty
land
or
you
know
the
world
without
shrimp
there's
a
world
without
shrimp
tara
willow
looks
at
her
i'm
allergic
he
he's
probably
in
troll
land
i
only
care
that
he's
not
here
and
i
got
this
nifty
souvenir
she
turns
and
puts
olaf's
hammer
on
the
countertop
after
a
moment
the
glass
breaks
and
the
hammer
plus
everything
else
on
the
counter
falls
into
the
display
case
below
with
a
loud
crashing
noise
oops
the
place
is
trashed
enough
anyway
well
see
how
well
things
worked
out
buffy
looks
fondly
at
anya
and
xander
and
look
at
you
guys
so
good
and
alive
and
together
buffy
starts
to
tear
up
again
so
together
and
good
and
alive
buffy
sniffles
turns
to
grab
a
tissue
oh
god
buffy
crying
i'm
i'm
just
so
happy
for
you
she
bursts
into
tears
and
buries
her
face
in
the
tissue
as
the
others
stare
cut
to
buffy
and
giles
sitting
at
the
table
in
the
summers
dining
room
i
cringe
to
think
what
the
place
would
have
looked
like
if
i'd
been
away
for
longer
than
three
days
well
maybe
we
would
have
had
time
to
clean
it
up
you
know
if
willow
used
some
magicks
to
help
yes
'cause
nothing
could
possibly
go
wrong
with
that
joyce
enters
with
a
tray
holding
a
teapot
and
several
mugs
rupert
i
still
don't
understand

joyce
giles
gets
up
and
takes
the
tray
oh
thank
you
why
the
other
watchers
made
you
go
all
the
way
to
england
when
they
don't
know
anything
she
and
giles
sit
down
on
either
side
of
buffy
giles
passing
out
mugs
well
they
don't
know
it
yet
i
mean
they
have
no
record
of
of
glory
or
anyone
like
her
but
uh
based
on
the
information
that
i've
given
them
they're
gonna
look
into
it
um
they
might
have
something
soon
what
about
the
key
were
they
all
over
it
giles
warily
yes

of
it
myself

pouring
tea
well
they're
interested
certainly
and
uh
full
of
theories
giles
sits
back
lifting
his
cup
most
of
them
nonsensical
the
camera
pans
past
giles
into
the
hallway
we
see
dawn
coming
down
the
stairs
stopping
when
she
hears
voices

little
girl

back
to
dawn
on
the
stairs
listening
giles

what

it
out
what
would
they
do
giles
os
i
don't
know
