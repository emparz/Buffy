and

looking
unhappy

left
corner
of
her
bottom
lip
is
busted
did
you
find
faith
buffy
just
looks
at
them
saying
nothing
you
didn't…
she's
not
here
buffy
shakes
her
head
slightly
how
is
he
he
comes
in
and
out
i
think
the
pain
is
less
now
buffy
frowns
slightly
would
you

i'd
like
to
be
alone
with
him
oz
and
willow
look
at
each
other
oz
nods
of
course
as
they
walk
past
buffy

turns
to
her
we'll
try
to
find
another
cure
buffy
quietly
as
they
leave
the
house
thanks
cut
to
angel
lying
on
his
bed
buffy
sits
down
and
takes
his
hand
buffy
buffy
lays
her
right
hand
against
the
side
of
his
face
is
that
you
buffy
gives
him
a
slight
smile
it's
me
angel
tries
to
smile
in
return
i
didn't
want
to
go
without
seeing
you
buffy
puts
a
finger
on
his
lips
to
stop
him
from
talking
angel
i
can
cure
you
it's
okay
i'm
ready
angel
listen
to
me
buffy
takes
a
hold
of
his
shoulders
sit
up
angel
scoots
up
a
little
higher
but
he
is
weak
and
moving
clearly
hurts
a
great
deal
you're
gonna
live
you
have
to
live
angel
frowns
what
way
drink…
angel
frowns
at
her
buffy
takes
off
her
jacket
a
determined
expression
on
her
face
drink
me
angel
stares
at
her
in
shock
he
shakes
his
head
rejecting
the
idea
no
it's
the
only
way
angel
keeps
shaking
his
head
and
forces
himself
up
out
of
the
bed
pushing
buffy
aside
no
get
away
buffy
takes
a
hold
of
his
right
arm
as
he
stands
up
looking
up
at
him
it'll
save
you
angel
is
looking
down
at
the
floor
it'll
kill
you
maybe
not
not
if
you
don't
take
it
all
angel
keeps
shaking
his
head
still
not
looking
at
her
you
can't
ask
me
to
do
that
i
won't
let
you
die
i
can't
angel
still
won't
look
at
her
angel
the
blood
of
a
slayer
is
the
only
cure
angel
finally
glances
at
buffy
faith…
buffy
swallows
and
answers
quietly
i
tired
i
killed
her
angel
shakes
his
head
and
lurches
away
from
buffy
then
it's
over
angel
stumbles
into
the
main
room
he
has
trouble
walking
straight
bumps
into
the
wall
then
stumbles
and
catches
himself
on
the
sofa
table
spilling
a
pewter
pitcher
and
plate
onto
the
floor
buffy
grabs
him
by
the
arms
and
pulls
him
up
to
face
her
it
is
never
over
i
won't
let
you
die
drink
angel
glances
up
at
her
swaying
in
her
grip
please
buffy
looks
at
him
then
pulls
back
her
right
fist
and
hits
his
left
temple
his
head
snaps
around
but
he
stays
on
his
feet
he
turns
back
to
look
at
buffy
and
she
hits
him
again
he
still
doesn't
go
down
but
it
takes
him
a
little
longer
to
come
back
up
buffy
hits
him
a
third
time
and
this
time
angel
spins
back
with
a
growl
vamped
out
he
just
stands
there
staring
at
her
while
buffy
pulls
down
the
shoulder
strap
of
her
shirt
then
grabs
him
by
the
hair
at
the
back
of
his
head
she
looks
at
him
for
a
moment
then
firmly
pulls
his
head
down
against
her
neck
and
holds
him
there
for
a
moment
they
remain
like
this
then
we
see
a
closeup
of
his
yellow
eye
looking
down
and
he
suddenly
bites
down
buffy
gasps
with
the
pain
but
holds
still
angel
is
holding
on
to
her
now
and
you
get
to
hear
all
those
sucking
and
drinking
noises
closeup
of
his
mouth
on
buffy's
neck
some
blood
is
running
out
beneath
his
lips
and
running
down
her
shoulder
buffy's
face
scrunches
up
she
mouths
what
looks
like
'oh
lord'
and
slowly
sinks
backwards
to
the
floor
with
angel
lying
on
top
still
drinking
buffy's
lefthand
reaches
out
and
finds
the
pewter
pitcher
she
crushes
it
in
her
hand
the
camera
keeps
jerking
around
the
whole
time
and
buffy
is
clearly
not
enjoying
the
experience
she
puts
her
hands
against
his
sides
as
if
she
was
going
to
push
him
off
but
kicks
out
with
her
left
leg
instead
breaking
the
sofa
table
in
half
she
stares
up
into
the
camera
a
tear
in
the
corner
of
her
left
eye
then
her
eyes
drift
shut
and
her
head
sinks
to
the
side
just
as
angel
finally
rolls
off
her
panting
his
face
morphs
back
to
human
and
he
pushes
himself
up
looking
over
at
buffy
the
redness
around
the
arrow
wound
is
gone
angel
worried
buffy
buffy
lies
motionless
eyes
closed
angel
bending
over
her
buffy

over
to

starts
to
move
her
head
with
a
soft
protest
a
nurse
comes
in
and
tries
to
pull
his
hand
away

throws
him
clear
across
the
room

mayor
impacts
with
a
window
looking

it
then

to

two
nurses
to

up
at
a
mad
angel
and
picks

up

clearly
reluctant
to

glances
up
at

out
of
the

as

leaves
through
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
hallway
cut
to
buffy
walking
through
faith's
apartment
her
arms
crossed
in
front
of
her
there
are
cardboard
boxes
stacked
everywhere

stops
and
sees
a
cat
jump
up
on
faith's
bed
who's
going
to
look
after
him
it's
a
she
and
aren't
these
things

of
themselves

walks
up
behind
buffy
and
stops
next
to
her
a
higher
power
guiding
us
faith
looks
at
her
then
turns
away
and
keeps
walking
towards
the
camera
i'm
pretty
sure

looking
down

standing
in

of
the
broken
window
looking
out
sorry

my
head
a
lot
of
new
stuff
buffy
looks
at
her
with
a
half
smile
the
cat
on
the
bed
turns
for
a
split
second
into
the
image
of
a
girl
laying
on
the
bed
in
white
gown
at
the
same
time
as
faith
still
looking

in
the
palm
of
her
hand

as
buffy
looks
back
up

laugh
in

and
looks
down

towards
buffy
getting
towards
that
time
buffy
looks
at
all
the
boxes
and
the
weapons

gets
out
of

and
slowly

over
to
where
faith
lies
she
looks
down
at
her
then
softly
kisses
her
forehead
cut
to
buffy
fully
dressed
walking
down
the
corridor
where
xander
is
pacing
while
the
others
are
sitting
on
a
bench
they
see
her
and
get
up
to
greet
her
buffy

in
front
of
sunnydale
high
there
are
benches
set
up
for
the
graduation
and
a
podium
for
the
speaker
snyder
stands
at
a
table
holding
a
box
full
of
diplomas
tapping
one
of
them
in
his
hands
and
looking
around
then
sticking
it
into
the
box
with
the
others
cut
to
the
library
buffy
is
sitting
on
a
chair
with
her
back
to
the
door
facing
the
others
giles
and
xander
on
the
right
side
of
the
table
willow
and
oz
on
the
left
cordelia
standing
just
left
of
the
steps
while
angel
is
over
against
the
wall
on
the
right
side
of
the
steps
in
the
shadows
so
am
i
crazy
well
'crazy'
is
such
a
strong
word
giles
chewing
on
his
glasses
let's
not
rule
it
out
though
you
don't
think
it
can
be
done
i
didn't
say
that
i
might
but
not
yet
i
personally
don't
think
it's
impossible
to
come
up
with
a
crazier
plan
we
attack
the
mayor
with
humus
i
stand
corrected
just
trying
to
keep
things
in
perspective
cordelia
sarcastic
thank
you
my
point
however
is
crazy
or
not
it's
pretty
much
the
only
plan
besides
it's
buffy's
and
she's
slay
gal
you
know
ms
little
likestofight
so
xander
interrupts
cordelia
i
think
there
was
a
'yea'
vote
buried
in
there
somewhere
well
i'm
going
to
need
every
single
one
of
you
on
board
especially
you
xander
you're
sort
of
the
key
figure
here
key
me
xander
takes
a
deep
breath
okay
pride
humility
and
here
is
the
mindnumbing
fear
xander
sighs
what
do
i
have
to
do
do
you
remember
any
of
your
military
training
from
when
you
became
soldier
guy
xander
points
at
her
uh
rocket
launcher
buffy
regretfully
rocket
launcher
not
going
to
get
it
done
i
mean
it
took
a
volcano
to
kill
one
of
these
things
last
time
giles
gets
up
and
walks
towards
buffy
um
buffy
all
of
this
is
rather
depended
on
your
being
able
to
control
the
mayor
faith
told
me
to
play
on
his
human
weakness
faith
told
you
was
that
before
or
after

her
into
a
coma
after
oh
his
weakness
right

my
best…
giles

his
glasses
back
on
well
let's…
let's…ah

angel
you
hung
with
him
the
most
is
there
something
that
he's
afraid
of
buffy's
looking
down
uncomfortably
well
he's
not
crazy
about
germs
of
course
that's
it
we
attack
him
with
germs
great
we'll
corner
him
and
then
you
can
sneeze
on
him
cordelia
gesturing
excitedly
no
no
we'll
get
a
box
with
the
ebola
virus
and…
and…
or
it
doesn't
even
have
to
be
real
we
can
just
get
a
box
that
says
ebola
on
it
and…
uhm
cordelia
snaps
her
fingers
chase
him…
oz
frowns
and
no
one
else
says
anything
with
the
box…
i'm
starting
to
lean
towards
the
humus
offensive
he'll
never
see
it
coming
faith
at
the
hospital
he
was
grieving
seriously
crazed

a
step
towards
her
clasping
his

while
cordelia
looks
down
i
might
be
needed
cordelia
looks
up
at
him
needed
or…

wesley
takes
a
deep
breath
and
leans
down
to
kiss
cordelia
putting
his
hands
behind
his
back
cordelia
puts
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
tries
to
kiss
him
they
bump
noses
and
juggle
awkwardly
wesley
waves
his
hands
around
in
the
air
beside
cordelia
cordelia
tries
to
wrap
her
arms
around
his
back
to
pull
him
unsuccessfully
closer
they
maneuver
around
a
bit
more
then
pull
back
to
look
at
each
other
breaking
apart
cordelia
looks
to
the
side
and
wipes
her
mouth
they
try
again
but
with
about
as
much
success
they
break
back
apart
and
cordelia
sighs
in
frustration
and
disappointment
she
wipes
her
mouth
again
and
looks
back
up
at
him
taking
a
deep
breath
good
luck
in
england
wesley
nods
and
puts
his
glasses
back
on

cordelia
smiles
at
him
that'll
be
neat

a
comforting
way
of
not
answering
the
question
oz
blinks
and
almost
shrugs
willow
and
oz
lean
forward
and
they
kiss
softly
oz
puts
his

more

with
a
frown

mayor
nothing
mayor
looks
up
buffy
and
the
other
students
look
up
to
see
the
sun
being
totally
blocked
the
mayor
flinches
in
pain
then
swallows
and
continues
his
speech
and
so
as
we
look
back
on…
pain
hits
him
again
and
he
turns
half
to
the
side
groaning
on
the
events
that
brought
us
to
this
day
mayor
in
another
wave
of
pain
buffy
with
her
hat
off
come
on

mayor
stops
in
pain
again
all
the

are
watching
tensely

all…
mayor
screams
the
students
and
the
faculty
look
at
each
other
uneasily
it
has
begun
my
destiny
mayor
smiles
it's
a
little
sooner
than
i
expected
i
had
this
whole
section
on
civic
pride…
mayor
shuffles
cue
cards
but
i
guess
we'll
just
skip
to
the
big
finish
buffy
and
willow
look
at
each
other
as
the
mayor
starts
to
grimace
and
stretch
and
grow
his
suit
splits
around
him
and
snyder
is
leaning
back
in
his
seat
looking
taken
aback
the
mayor
suddenly
transforms
into
a
big
snakelike
demon
with
clawed
mandibles
surrounding
its
mouth
it
keeps
growing
stretching
higher
as
the
faculty
abandons
their
seats
the
students
get
up
but
stay
in
place
staring
up
at
the
mayor
who
seems
to
stretch
up
above
the
roof
of
the
school
part
5

the
students
stare
up
as
the
parents
in
the
back
to
panic
and
leave
a
group
of
vampires
comes
up
the
steps
behind
the

down
and

student
in
the
first
row
buffy
stares
in
shock
as
some
of
the
students
start
milling
around

cut

students
fighting
cut
to
the

head
swing
in
the
air
from
the
mayor's
point

hey

faith's
knife
in

right
hand
you
remember
this
buffy
looking
up
at
the

i
took
it
from
faith
stuck
it
in
her
gut
buffy
looks
at
the
knife
then
back
up
at
the
mayor
just
slid
in
her
like
she
was
butter
cut
to
the
mayor
gnashing
his
teeth
and
growling

buffy
turns
and
runs
into

in
pursuit
cut
to
the
hall
buffy
opens
the
door
and
runs
in
the
mayor
barrels
down
the
door
and
some
of
the
surrounding
wall
as
he
pursues
her
buffy
keeps
running
towards
the
library
while
the
mayor
tears
through
the
school
like
a
freight
train
buffy
runs
into
the
library
vaults
a
banister
looking
back
at
the
mayor
the
mayor
looks
around
the
library
and
sees
the
barrels
of
diesel
fuel
and
bags
of
fertilizer
stacked
everywhere
buffy
keeps
running
and
jumps
out
of
a
window
cut
to
the
mayor
looking
around
and
growling
mayor
in
his
own
voice
that
sounds
like
it
is
coming
from
the
bottom
of
a
rain
barrel
well
gosh
cut
to
buffy
crouching
down
next
to
giles
who
pushes
down
the
plunger
cut
to
a
fire
cloud
erupting
from
the
top
of
the
school
cut
to
xander
and
angel
looking
up
at
the
explosion
cut
to
some
more
explosions
erupting
from
the
school
cut
to
percy
laying
on
the
steps
looking
up
at
them
cut
to
jonathon
protectively
wrapping
his
arms
around
a
girl
as
he
looks
at
another
explosion
cut
to
more
explosions
erupting
all
along
the
school
cut
to
buffy
and
giles
nest
to
the
plunger
close
on
buffy
staring
then
looking
over
at
giles
cut
to
police
cars
and
fire
trucks
parked
in
front
of
the
school
the
air
is
dark
and
smoky
we
see
two
fire
men
wheeling
a
gurney
with
a
groaning
wesley
over
towards
an
ambulance
if
i
could…
could
just
get
something
for
the
pain
it's
rather
a
lot
of
pain
actually
aspirin
if
you
would…
uh…
ah…
the
fire
men
start
sliding
the
gurney
into
the
ambulance
perhaps
i
could
just
be
knocked
unconscious
more
groaning
as
they
slide
him
into
the
ambulance
pan
to
xander
and
buffy
walking
by
xander
watches
wesley
being
put
in
the
ambulance
buffy
keeps
looking
around
her
we
got
off
pretty
cheap…
considering
buffy
still
looking
around
seems
like
we
did
they
walk
a
few
more
steps
then
buffy
stops
still
looking
around
xander
stops
beside
her
his
hands
buried
in
his
pockets
he
made
it
through
the
fight
buffy
whips
around
to
look
at
him
guess
maybe
he
xander
takes
a
deep
breath
he
took
off
after
buffy
blinks
and
looks
down
xander
makes
a
grimace
then
turns
and
walks
away
buffy
stand
there
again
looking
around
and
giles
comes
up
to
her
giles
puts
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
are
you
all
right
buffy
lays
her
head
to
one
side
i'm
tired
giles
smiles
i
should
imagine
so
it's
been
quite
a
couple
of
days
buffy
tiredly
i
haven't
processed
everything
yet
buffy
with
a
small
laugh
my
brain
isn't
really
functioning
on
the
higher
levels
buffy
takes
a
deep
breath
it's
pretty
much
fire
bad
tree
pretty
giles
shakes
his
head
understandable
well
when
it's
working
again
congratulate
it
on
a
good
campaign
you
did
very
well
buffy
nods
thank
you
i
will
giles
puts
his
glasses
on
i
ah…
i
managed
to
ferret
this
out
of
the
wreckage
now
it
may
not
interest
you
but…
giles
reaches
into
his
jacket
and
pulls
out
a
high
school
diploma
i'd
say
you
earned
it
giles
hands
it
to
buffy
who
looks
at
it
and
takes
it
giles
taking
a
deep
breath
and
looking
around
there
is
a
certain
giles
takes
off
his
glasses
dramatic
irony
that's
attached
to
all
this
a
synchronicity
that
borders
on…
on
predestination
one
might
say
buffy
looks
at
him
fire
bad
tree
pretty'
giles
looks
at
buffy
yes
s…sorry
giles
puts
his
glasses
back
on
i'm
going
to
see
to
wesley
see
if
he's…
is
still…
giles
suppressing
a
laugh
whimpering
walks
off
and
buffy
looks
after
him
suddenly
she
turns
around
a
slight
frown
on
her
face
her
eyes
lock
on
something
and
her
face
clears
cut
to
angel
standing
beside
a
fire
truck
looking
at
her
close
on
angel's
face
close
on
buffy's
face
both
just
staring
at
each
other
buffy
blinks
and
her
face
falls
she
hugs
herself
a
little
closer
close
on
angel
first
obscured
by
some
firemen
walking
by
then
by
a
cloud
of
smoke
the
smoke
blows
by
and
he
steps
back
slowly
turns
around
and
walks
off
cut
to
buffy
watching
him
leave
cut
to
angel
disappearing
into
the
smoke
cut
to
willow
sitting
on
a

fun
willow
smiling
how
about
the
part
where
we
kicked
some
demon
ass

hair
from

hate
that
hear

raises
her
eyebrows
and
nods

up
at

buffy
nods
and
says
in
a
small
voice

could
use
a
little
sleep
though
willow
nods
and
agrees
emphatically
yeah
buffy
sits
down
on
the
bench
next
to
her
if
someone
could
just
wake
me
when
it's
time
to
go
to
college
that'd
be
great
willow
smiles
at
her
oz
puts
his
hands
in
his
pockets

a
moment
to
deal
with
this
we
survived

at
him

up
from
