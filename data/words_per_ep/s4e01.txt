it's
night
in
the
cemetery
and
buffy
is
pacing
back
and
forth
willow
is
seated
crosslegged
reading
papers
buffy
sighing
anything
ah
'introduction
to
the
modern
novel'
a
survey
study
of
twentieth
century
novelists
open
to
freshmen
you
might
like
that
'introduction
to
the
modern
novel'
i'm
guessing
i'd
probably
have
to
read
the
modern
novel
maybe
more
than
one
i
like
books
i
just
don't
want
to
take
on
too
much
do
they
have
an
introduction
to
the
modern
blurb
oh
short
story
well
that's
good
oh
no
it
conflicts
with
psych
maybe
i
shouldn't
take
psych
you
gotta
iit's
fun
aand
you
can
use
it
as
your
science
requirement
anyway
professor
walsh
is
supposed
to
be
great
she's
like
worldrenowned
how
do
you
get
to
be
renowned
i
mean
like
do
you
have
to
be
'nowned'
first
yes
first
there's
the
painful
'nowning'
process
wait
'images
of
pop
culture'
this
is
good
tthey
watch
movies
ttv
shows
even
commercials
for
credit
heh
isn't
college
cool
how'd
i
miss
that
one
buffy
walks
over
and
sits
beside
her
well
you
did
sort
of
wait
till
the
last
minute
with
your
course
selection
sorry
'miss
ichosemymajorinplaygroup'
that's
an
exaggeration
i
just
you
know
think
it's
good
to
be
prepared
don't
want
to
be
caught
unawares
behind
them
a
hand
thrusts
up
out
of
a
fresh
grave
well
i've
been
busy
it's
been
a
very
slayheavy
summer
i
just
haven't
had
a
whole
lot
of
time
to
think
about
life
at
uc
sunnydale
a
vampire's
head
and
shoulders
emerge
from
the
grave
it's
exciting
though
isn't
it
yeah
it's
gonna
be
an
adjustment
yeah
it's
like
five
miles
away
it's
uncharted
territory
the
vampire
struggles
to
climb
up
giles
said
i
have
to
be
secretidentity
gal
again
that
makes
sense
the
vampire
makes
it
out
of
the
grave
and
starts
walking
toward
them
his
face
vamped
out
it's
gonna
be
tough
though
with
a
roommate
yeah
i'm
psyched
about
college
the
vampire
smiles
as
he
gets
closer
definitely
the
vamp
stops
as
he
sees
weapons
stacked
against
a
gravestone
i
just
need
to
figure
out
how
it's
going
to
work
with
my
extracurricular
activities
the
vamp
looks
at
buffy
the
smile
gone
i
just
can't
let
it
take
the
edge
off
my
slaying
shaking
his
head
the
vampire
turns
and
walks
away
i
gotta
stay
sharp
buffy
looks
behind
her
toward
the
fresh
grave
is
this
guy
ever
gonna
wake
up

buffy
looks
at
the
folders
in
her
arms
but
doesn't
see
a
yellow
one
she
starts
to
walk
in
the
indicated
direction
girl
standing

collective
intelligence

like
this
force

penetrating
force

feel
my
mind
opening
upyou

the
nuremberg

whole
new
world
the
bookstore

are
milling
about
carrying
books
in
shopping
baskets

knocks
the
books
off

politely
and

works
her
way
through

over
to
the
bed
and
sits
down
so

nice
room

right
side

of
parties

that
i'm
a
crazy
partier

hyper
either

just
excited
yeah
me
too
kathy
crosses
the
room
and
picks
up
a
folded
poster
and
carries
it
to
a
wall
on
her
side
of
the
room
i
am
really
glad
they
put
me
with
somebody

kathy
unfolds
the
poster
onto
the
wall
revealing
it
to
be
of
celine
dion
nighttime
buffy
is
laying
in
bed
listening
to
kathy
snore
smack
her
lips
and
mumble
in
her
sleep
day
time
buffy
is
in
a
lecture
hall
while
professor
reegert
gives
his
introductory
lecture
the
point
of
this
course
is
not
to
critique
popular
american
culture
it
is
not
to
pick
at
it
or
look
down
upon
it
and
it
is
not
to
watch
videos
for
credit
professor
reegert
small
laughter
from
students
the
point
is
to
examine
buffy
whispers
to
student
beside
her
do
you
know
if
this
class
is
full
yet
and
there
are
two
people
talking
at
once
and
i
know
that
one
of
them
is
me
and
the
other
is
a
blonde
girl
you
blonde
girl
stand
up
i'm
very
excited
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
that's
worth
interrupting
my
lecture
for
buffy
stands
i
was
just
asking
if
the
class
was
still
open
if
i
could
still
sign
up
professor
reegert
picks
up
a
clipboard
if
your
name
isn't
on
this
sheet
then
you
are
wasting
everyone's
time
are
you
on
the
sheet
they
told
me
that
if
i
just
do
you
understand
you
are
sucking
energy
from
everyone
in
this
room
they
came
here
to
learn
get
out
i
didn't
mean
to
suck
leave
buffy

it
on
good
authority
that
this
was
a
party
school
i
think
it's
supposed
to
get
easier
i
still
feel
like
carrying
around
a
security
blanket
'of
human
bondage'
have
you
ever
read
it
oh
i'm
not
really
into
porn
i
mean
i'm
just
i'm
trying
to
cut
way
back
eddie
laughs
no
there's
no
actual
bondage
it's
just
a
novel
i've
read
it
like
ten
times
i
always
keep
it
by
my
bed
security
blanket
i
don't
really
have
a
security
blanket
unless
you
count
mr
pointy
mr
pointy
oh
bike
path
so
it's
nice
to
know
that
i'm
not
the
only
entirely
confused
person
on
this
campus

suspect
there's
a
lot
of
us

towards
buffy's
room
oh
i
didn't

for
they
reach
her
room
and
buffy
sees
that
it's
crammed
with
wooden
crates

didn't
move
anything

walking
through
the
kitchen
heading
out
when

of
her
things
are
missing
she
walks
to
the
bare

and
reads
it
'this

there's
a
band
on
stage
playing
a
slow
sad
song
buffy
enters
and
looks
around
not
seeing
anyone
she
knows
she
walks
over
to
a
couch
and
spots
a
man
across
the
room
turned
three
quarters
away
from
her
that
looks
like
angel
he
turns
enough
so
that
she
can
see
his
face
and
it
isn't
him
the
whole
world
in
front
of
her
and
she
comes
back
to
this
dive
she
turns
around
and
sees
him
xander
buffy
gives
him
a
onearmed
hug

about
a
month
and
a
half
while
i
tried
to
pay
for
the
repairs
no
one
really
bothered
me
or
even
spoke
to
me
until
one
night
when
one
of
the
male
strippers
called
in
sick
and
no
power
on
this
earth
will
make
me
tell
you

to
the
arms
of
my
loving
parents

cut
what
slaying
slaying
everything

let
it
control
you
'fear
leads
to
anger

leads
to
hate
hate
leads
to
anger'
no

the
dadaist
pep
talk

xander
gets
up
and
crouches
down
in
front
of
her
buffy
i've
gone
through
some
fairly
dark
times
in
my
life
faced
some
scary
things
among
them
the
kitchen
at
'the
fabulous
ladies
night
club'
let
me
tell
you
something
when
it's
dark
and
i'm
all
alone
and
i'm
scared
or
freaked
out
or
whatever
i
always
think
'what
would
buffy
do'
you're
my
hero
ok
sometimes
when
it's
dark
and
i'm
all
alone
i
think
'what
is
buffy
wearing'
can
that
be
one
of
those
things
you
never
ever
tell
me
about
it's
a
deal
xander
stands
up
let's
put
this
bitch
in
the
ground
what
do
you
say
she
holds
out
her
right
hand
and
he
helps
her
up
i
think
i
say
thank
you
and
nothing
says
thank
you
like
dollars
in
the
waistband
ok
what
do
we
do
first
interior
some
type
of
office
with
a
computer
and
file
cabinets
the
glass
in
the
door
is
broken
buffy's
at
the
counter
working
the
computer
and
xander
is
examining
newspapers
at
a
desk
kids
disappearing
every
year
not
too
many
just
enough
so
that
everyone
thinks
they
up
and
left
i
can't
believe
the
vampires
took
your
stuff
murder
i
expect
but
petty
larceny
seems
so
petty
they
have
to
be
keeping
it
somewhere
on
campus
or
at
least
near
by
hey
how
far
back
do
the
disappearances
go
buffy
types
at
the
keyboard
we
see
she's
still
not
using
her
left
arm
uhh
they
weren't
too
common
before
'82
match
number
check
this
out
xander
carries
two
newspapers
over
to
the
counter
and
buffy
picks
one
up
and
reads
it
aloud
'psi
theta
loses
it's
charter
building
to
be
closed
for
renovation'
1982
look
at
this
xander
reads
from
the
other
paper
'former
psi
theta
fraternity
house
lies
dormant
while
zoning
issues
drag
on
before
the
city
council'
we
have
a
winner

pretty
cherry

up
for
a
little
reconnaissance
you
mean
where
we
all
sculpt
and
paint
and
stuff
no
that
was
the
renaissance
oh

had
a
really
long
week

go
look
at
the
house
nighttime
exterior
of
a
building
with
signs
posted
reading
'this
property
closed
to
the
public'
and
'keep
out'
buffy
and
xander
arrive
up
on
the
roof
buffy
clears
some
debris
from
the
skylight
she
is
laying
on
the
vamps
can
be
seen
inside
going
through
buffy's
things
xander
works
his
way
to
the
skylight
score
sunday

holding
a
skirt
up
to
herself
and
mockingly
shaking
her
hips

a
mocking
voice
look
how
tough
i
am
oh
that's
my
skirt
you're
never
going
to
fit
in
it
with
those
hips
we
have
to
kill
them
we
need
weapons
i
don't
see
my
weapons
trunk
down
there
it
was
right
by
my
bed
mr
gordo
buffy
voice
turns
to
steele
go
to
my
room
if
it's
not
there
try
willow's
i'll
keep
an
eye
my
diary
uhoh
score
i'll
hurry
xander
works
his
way
back
from
the
skylight
laugh
all
you
want
this
time
we
play
it
my
way
and
the
rules
are
just
going
to
be
a
little
bit
the
skylight
gives
way
and
buffy
falls
into
the
room
buffy
hitting
the
floor
unh
the
vamps
all
stop
what
they're
doing
and
look
at
her
ahh
ah
buffy
looks
up
at
the
vamps
oh
scene
transition

say
don't
i
know
you
from
beating
the
crap
out
of
you
buffy
standing
up
i
just
thought
i'd
drop
in
get
it
drop
in
boy
tough
room
i
must
say
you've
really
got
me
now
i
mean
it's
a
diabolical
plan
throw
yourself
at
my
feet
with
a
broken
arm
and
no
weapons
of
any
kind
how'm
i
going
to
get
out
of
this
one
you
got
a
nice
setup
here
but
you
made
one
mistake
yeah
what
was
that
well
i'm
not
actually
positive
but
statistically
speaking
people
usually
make
at
least
sunday
punches
her
kathy
oz
and
willow
are
in
buffy's
and
kathy's
dorm
room
it
seems
kind
of
weird
kathy
hands
the
note
to
oz
yeah
weird's
a
pretty
good
word
for
it
buffy
wouldn't
just
take
off
ththat's
just
not
in
her
nature
except
for
that
one
time
she
disappeared
for
several
months
and
changed
he
name
but
there
were
circumstances
then
there's
no
circumstances
does
buffy
have
a
history
of
emotional
problems
'cause
on
my
request
form
i
was
pretty
specific
about
a
stable
nonsmoker
i
don't
think
this
is
her
handwriting
i
bet
there
were
circumstances
we've
probably
been
so
wrapped
up
in
our
own
petty
lives
that
that
we
totally
missed
the
circumstances
we're
bad
friends
let's
think
this
through
how
can
you
be
so
calm
long
arduous
hours
of
practice
now
either
buffy
took
off
or
she
was
robbed
or
it's
a
prank
xander
xander
walks
into
the
room
with
arms
spread
wide
how
are
my
guys
xander
hugs
willow
then
hugs
kathy
i
don't
know
you
do
i
no
this
is
very
intrusive
isn't
it
little
bit
xander
lets
her
go
xander
kathy
xander
looks
at
oz
do
we
hug
i
think
we're
too
manly
what's
the
prank
prank
oh
the
room
well
some
friends
of
buffy's
played
a
funny
joke
and
they
took
her
stuff

help
get
it
back
from
her
friends
who
sleep
all
day
and
have
no
tans
oh
those
friends
funny

falls
as
she
gets
hit
again
on
the
floor
she
looks
over
and
sees
her
trunk
she
starts
to
crawl
toward
it
sunday
steps
in
front
of
her
holding
buffy's
'class
protector'
award
oh
and
this
this
is
my
favorite
item
you
don't
want
to
touch
that
sunday
drops
it
on
the
floor
and
stomps
down
on
the
handle
breaking
it
she
moves
over
to
buffy
and
grabs
her
left
arm
you
know
this
arm's
not
looking
so
good
it
might
have
to
come
off
you
want
to
know
the
truth
i
only
need
one
she
hits
sunday
with
a
roundhouse
punch
with
her
right
fist
sending
her
spinning
she
rolls
to
her
feet
and
kicks
sunday
in
the
face
and
flips
her
over
the
couch
onto
the
coffee
table
she
catches
some
broken
wood
from
the
coffee
table
with
her
foot
and
kicks
sunday
in
the
face
with
it
sunday
falls
into
a
pile
of
clutter
this
is
startin'
to
suck
sunday
gets
up
all
vamped
out
fatvamp
runs
in
to
help
buffy
grabs
a
tennis
racket
steps
onto
the
arm
of
a
chair
and
roundhouse
kicks
sunday
and
does
a
backhand
swing
with
the
racket
into
fatvamp's
face
sending
her
flying
over
the
couch
and
braking
the
frame
off
the
racket
making
a
perfect
stake
sunday
moves
in
for
some
closein
fighting
a
vamp
no
doubt
frightened
by
the
sight
of
a
vampire
slayer
with
a
stake
decides
it's
time
to
leave
and
moves
toward
the
door
which
opens
with
xander
in
the
lead
and
oz
behind
him
brandishing
a
cross
in
the
vamp's
face
they
force
the
vamp
back
spicolivamp
sees
willow
struggling
with
a
crossbow
and
rushes
her
willow
gets
the
crossbow
up
just
in
time
and
shoots
the
bolt
through
spicolivamp's
heart
spicolivamp
turns
to
dust
but
before
he's
gone
he
says
one
last
thing
woah

is
lying
on
the
floor
with
buffy
standing
above
her
when
you
look
back
at
this
in
the
three
seconds
it'll
take
you
to
turn
to
dust
buffy
fatvamp
decides
it's
a
good
time
to
leave
and
runs
out
i
think
you'll
find
the
mistake
was
touching
my
stuff
sunday
gets
to
her
feet
and
rushes
buffy
who
swings
onearmed
at
