pop's
pumpkin
patch
the
camera
pans
down
from
the
sign
over
the
stand
past
another
one
counting
off
the
days
until
halloween
to
a
pumpkin
on
the
ground
aglow
with
a
candle
buffy
lands
flat
on
her
back
on
top
of
it
she
looks
up
at
the
vampire
that
just
threw
her
and
sees
him
coming
toward
her
she
grabs
a
squash
lying
on
the
ground
behind
her
and
throws
it
at
him
hitting
him
in
the
forehead
she
follows
it
up
with
a
pumpkin
the
vampire
staggers
back
a
few
steps
buffy
hops
back
to
her
feet
she
pulls
a
stake
out
of
her
shirt
and
launches
it
at
him
he
grabs
the
scarecrow
and
pulls
it
over
in
front
of
him
so
the
stake
impales
it
instead
he
shoves
the
scarecrow
aside
and
comes
at
her
with
a
roundhouse
kick
they
start
fighting
handtohand
cut
to
a
view
of
them
through
a
camcorder
the
'record'
light
is
on
cut
to
another
vampire
taping
the
fight
he
gets
closer
for
a
better
view
cut
to
the
view
through
the
camcorder
buffy
continues
to
fight
the
first
vampire
the
'battery
low'
indicator
starts
flashing
a
moment
later
the
view
becomes
snowy
and
the
vampire
takes
the
camcorder
away
from
his
eye
he
jostles
it
and
it
starts
working
again
he
raises
it
back
to
his
eye
to
continue
recording
the
fight
goes
on
and
a
few
hits
later
the
first
vampire
knocks
buffy
into
the
hay
wagon
she
holds
onto
the
side
of
the
wagon
and
kicks
the
vampire
to
the
ground
she
turns
around
with
her
back
to
the
wagon
and
grabs
the
railing
as
the
vampire
gets
back
up
she
raises
her
legs
and
grabs
the
vampire's
head
in
a
scissor
hold
she
twists
her
body
and
flips
him
over
sideways
onto
the
ground
stepping
away
from
the
wagon
she
spies
the
sign
and
then
looks
down
at
the
vampire
he
tries
to
grab
for
her
legs
so
she
jumps
over
him
and
somersaults
to
the
countdown
sign
she
pulls
it
out
of
the
ground
and
swings
it
at
his
legs
as
he
comes
for
her
knocking
them
out
from
under
him
she
raises
the
sign
and
jams
the
end
of
the
signpost
into
his
chest
the
vampire
bursts
into
ashes
buffy
leaves
the
sign
stuck
in
the
ground
at
its
new
location
and
walks
out
of
the
pumpkin
patch
the
second
vampire
lowers
the
camcorder
and
slowly
backs
away
as
he
watches
her
go
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme

big
old
vamp

he
puts
his
satchel
down
on
the
table
and
heads
over
to
the
soda
vending
machine
he
puts
in
his
coins
and
hits
a
button
nothing
he
hits
another
one

hits
the
machine
in
the
front
and
on

up
to
him
and
puts
his
hand
on
xander's
shoulder
harris

usual
what
can
i
do
you
for
you
and
buffy
you're
just
friends
right
i
like
to
think
of
it
less
as
a
friendship
and
more
as
a
solid
foundation
for
future
bliss
so
she
she's
not
your
girlfriend
alas
no
larry
looks
over
at
buffy
as
he
walks
around
xander

think
she'd
go
out
with
me
he
turns
to
face
xander
with
buffy
to
his
back
now
well

a
tough
question
to

what
any
man
would
do
about
it
xander
grabs
larry
by
the
shirt
somethin'
damn
manly
larry
smiles
and
laughs
he
knocks
xander's
hands
away
and
grabs
him
by
the
shirt
with
his
right
hand
he
balls
his
left
hand
into
a
fist
and
draws
back
for
a
punch
buffy
grabs
his
wrist
pulls
it
behind
his
back
and
slams
his
head
into
the
vending
machine
a
diet
dr
pepper
rolls
into
the
slot

she
pulls
larry
back
from

larry
was
about
to
pummel
me
oh
that
forget
about
it
buffy
heads
back
to
the
table
oh
i'll
forget
about
it
xander
follows
her
in
maybe
fifteen
twenty
years
when
my
rep
for
being
a
sissy
man
finally
fades
buffy
stops
and
faces
him
xander
don't
you
think
you're
xander
interrupts
a
black
eye
heals
buffy
but
cowardice
has
an
unlimited
shelf
life
oh
thanks
thanks
a
lot
for
your
help
he
grabs
his
bag
from
the
table
and
walks
off
in
a
huff
buffy
moans
and
sits
back
down
with
willow
i
think
i
just
violated
the
guy
code
big
time
poor
xander
boys
are
so
fragile
speaking
of
how
was
your
date
last
night
misfire
i
was
late
due
to
unscheduled
slayage
showed
up
looking
trashed
was
he
mad
actually
he
was
pretty
unmad
which
probably
had
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
cordelia
was
drooling
in
his
cappuccino
oh
buffy
angel
would
never
fall
for
her
act
you
mean
that
'actually
showing
up
wearing
a
stunning
outfit
embracing
personal
hygiene'
act
you
know
what
i
mean
uh
she's
not
his
type
are
you
sure
i
mean
i
don't
know
what
his
type
is
i've
known
him
less
than
a
year
and
if
you
haven't
noticed
he's
not
exactly
one
to
over
share
true
it's
too
bad
we
can't
sneak
a
look
at
the
watcher
diaries
and
read
up
on
angel
i'm
sure
it's
full
of
fun
facts
to
know
and
tell
yeah
it's
too
bad
that
stuff
is
private
also
giles
keeps
them
in
his
office
in
his
personal
files
most
importantly
it
would
be
wrong
cut
to
the
library
willow
and
buffy
look
in
through
the
round
door
window
they
don't
see
giles
and
give
each
other
a
look
buffy
quietly
opens
the
door
and
goes
in
she
looks
back
at
willow
who
gives
her
encouragement
the
door
closes
and
willow
looks
in
through
the
glass
buffy
quietly
makes
her
way
up
to
the
counter
and
looks
around
again
for
giles
satisfied
that
he's
not
there
she
heads
for
his
office
buffy
she
spins
around
and
sees
him
in
the
cage
getting
some
old
books
excellent
nothing
hi

beginning
to
scare
me
giles
you
need
to
have
some
fun
she
waves
to
willow
to
come
in
as
he's
looking
down
at
his
books
willow
shakes
her
head
and
mouths
'no'
giles
looks
up
and
buffy
pulls
her
hand
back
and
pretends
she
was
scratching
her
head
you
know
there's
this
place
you
can
go
right
and
you
sit
in
the
dark
and
there
are
these
moving
pictures
right
and
the
pictures
tell
a
story
yes
yes
ha
ha
very
droll
willow
quietly
comes
in
i'll
have
you
know
that
i
have
very
uh
many
relaxing
hobbies

them
out
she
grabs
a
book
from
the
stack
he's
about
to
take
to
his
office
and
walks
around
him
to
draw
his
view
away
from
his
office
door
so
how
come
halloween
is
such
a
big
yawner
i
mean
do
the
demons
just
hate
how
commercial
it's
become
buffy
leafs
through
the
book
giles

his
books
down
um

the
book
from
her
what

has
made
it
to
the
office

of
interest
to
me

the
slayer
i
need
to
know

keep
me

the
dark
any
longer
willow
opens
the
door
and
starts
in
giles

the
stack
of
books
again
and
starts
to
turn
to
his
office
look
at
me
when
i
talk
to

willow
looks
over
at
them
anxiously
i
really
don't
have
time
for
these
games
ms
calendar
said
you

a
babe
willow
looks
back
again
but
this
time
gives
buffy
a
look
and
shakes
her
head
she
said
what
buffy
meekly
well
she
said
that
you
were
a
hhunk
of
burning
something
or
other
so
buffy
exhales
whadaya
think
of
that
uh
i
giles

even
contemplate
you
grownups
having
smoochies
buffy
sees
willow
come
out
of
the
office
with
a
diary
but
i
think
you
should
go
for
it
buffy
i
appreciate
your
interest
but
willow
hurries
past
the
counter
but
i've
overstepped
my
bounds
it's
none
of
my
business
you
know
buffy
stammers
what
was
i
thinking
my
god

buffy
willow
goes
out
the
door

buffy
quickly
walks
out
giles
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
a
babe
giles
smirks
i
can
live
with
that
cut
to
the
girls'
bathroom
buffy
and
willow
are
sitting
on
the
sinks
and
looking
at
a
drawing
of
a
noble
woman
with
a
tiny
waist
wearing
a
billowy
gown
man

at
her
who

pretty
coiffed
she
looks
like
a
noble
woman
or

when

cordelia
comes
into
the
bathroom
and
goes
to
the
mirror
so
buffy
you
ran
off
last
night
and
left
poor
little
angel
all
by
his
lonesome
but
i
did
everything
i
could
to
comfort
him
i'll
bet
cordelia
gets
out
her
blush
so
what's
his
story
anyway
i
mean
i
never
see
him
around
cordelia
brushes
some
onto
her
cheeks
not
during
the
day
anyway
oh
please
don't
tell
me
he
still
lives
at
home
like
he
has
to
wait
for
his
dad
to
get
back
before
he
can
take
the
car
cordelia
puts
the
blush
away
cordelia
i
think
his
parents
have
been
dead
for
a
couple
of
hundred
years
cordelia
touches
up
her
lip
gloss
oh

i
mean
cordelia
faces
them
what
angel's
a
vampire
i
thought
you
knew
cordelia
turns
back
to
the
mirror
oh
he's
a
vampire
cordelia
puts
away
the
lip
gloss
of
course
but
the
cuddly
kind
like
a
carebear
with
fangs
it's
true
cordelia
steps
over
to
them
you
know
what
i
think
cordelia
crosses
her
arms

of
the
competition
