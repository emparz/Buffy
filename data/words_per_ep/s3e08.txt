prologue

morning
at
sunnydale
high
school
willow
and
xander
slowly
walk
together
across
the
lawn
toward
the
walkway
to
the
main
entrance
in
their
hands
they
have
the
results
of
their
scholastic
aptitude
tests
with
which
neither
is
particularly
happy
this
is
a
nightmare
this
is
my
world
is
spinning
it's
not
that
bad
willow
really
740
verbal
i'mi'm
willow
searches
for
a
word
pathetic
illiterate
i'm
cletus
the
slackjawed
yokel
xander
shrugs
that's
right
and
the
fact
that
your
740
verbal
closely
resembles
my
combined
scores
in
no
way
compromises
your
position
as
the
village
idiot
they
fold
up
their
score
reports
as
they
near
a
bench
at
the
side
of
the
walkway
i
just
willow
sits
and
slouches
depressed
where
did
i
go
wrong
xander
sits
down
next
to
her
and
puts
his
arm
around
her
in
comfort
but
not
missing
the
opportunity
to
give
her
hair
a
gentle
stroke
you
did
amazing
willow
as
usual
behind
them
oz
and
cordelia
approach
you
guys
get
your
scores
xander
instantly
lets
go
of
willow
hops
to
his
feet
and
rushes
to
meet
her
cordelia
xander
points
willow
was
very
sad
by
her
academic
failure
xander
reaches
for
cordelia's
score
report
how
did
you
do
he
snags
it
from
her
hand
unfolds
it
and
reads
it
this
is
not
good
what's
not
good
oz
gives
willow
a
reassuring
stroke
of
her
hair
she
just
sadly
hands
him
her
report
to
see
well
i'm
just
worried
it
may
hurt
my
standing
as
campus
stud
when
people
find
out
i'm
dating
a
brain
cordelia
yanks
her
scores
from
his
hand
please
i
have
some
experience
in
covering
these
things
up
oz
to
willow
well
i
can
see
why
you'd
be
upset
willow
gives
him
a
hurt
look
grabs
her
report
back
from
him
and
looks
down
at
the
ground
her
feelings
of
failure
evident
in
her
furrowed
brow
that
was
my
sarcastic
voice
you
know
it
sounds
a
lot
like
your
regular
voice
i've
been
told
that
oz
trying
to
be
upbeat
but
we
should
celebrate
do
something
like
the
four
of
us
she
gives
xander
a
pointed
look
shaking
her
head
and
clearly
mouthing
no
he
ignores
her
completely
a
double
date
it
could
have
potential
buffy
walks
up
the
steps
from
the
street
a
long
look
on
her
face
and
joins
the
gang
willow
brightens
and
stands
up
buffy
hey
did
you
get
your
sat
scores
buffy
gives
her
a
weak
nod
by
the
look
on
your
face
i'm
guessing
you
and
i
are
gonna
be
manning
the
drivethrough
window
side
by
side
they're
just
test
scores
right
buffy
hands
hers
to
willow
what
do
they
really
mean
anyway
willow
unfolds
it
and
reads
willow
very
excited
1430
buffy
you
kicked
ass
buffy
raises
her
eyebrows
at
her
friend
cordelia's
eyes
go
wide
with
amazement
willow
more
calmly
okay
willow
folds
the
report
so
academic
achievement
gets
me
a
little
excited
buffy
hands
her
scores
to
xander
for
him
to
see
buff
that's
amazing
let
me
see
that
she
yanks
it
out
of
xander's
hand
before
he
can
even
begin
to
unfold
it
and
checks
it
out
yeah
with
scores
like
that
you
can
apply
pretty
much
anywhere
you
want
buffy
this
could
like
change
your
whole
future
buffy
unsure
what
to
make
of
it
the
thought
had
occurred
to
me
then
why
the
sour
puss
i
don't
know
i
guess
my
future
i
never
really
thought
about
it
i
wasn't
even
sure
i
was
going
to
have
one
cordelia
smiling
hugely
well
i
think
this
is
great
now
you
can
leave
and
never
come
back
she
gets
looks
from
everyone
xander
hands
buffy
back
her
scores
well
i
mean
that
in
a
positive
way
get
out
of
sunnydale
that's
a
good
thing
what
kind
of
moron
would
ever
wanna
come
back
here
cut
to
a
small
park
and
playground
that
night
a
classic
1958
dodge
desoto
fireflite
crashes
through
the
'welcome
to
sunnydale'
sign
and
screeches
to
a
halt
the
door
opens
and
a
nearly
empty
liquor
bottle
falls
out
and
smashes
to
pieces
on
the
pavement
spike
slides
off
of
his
seat
and
hits
the
street
flat
on
his
back
on
top
of
the
broken
glass
drunk
out
of
his
mind
he
lifts
his
head
unsteadily
and
tries
to
raise
himself
to
his
elbows
home
sweet
spike
chuckles
home
he
passes
out
and
collapses
back
to
the
pavement
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

spike's
old
burnedout
factory
the
place
is
a
shambles
although
the
great
table
where
giles
started
the
fire
is
essentially
intact
if
scorched
spike
strolls
through
the
area
stepping
over
the
strewn
chairs
while
singing
a
few
bars
from
my
way
and
more
much
more
than
this
i
did
it
my
way
cut
to
the
bedroom
in
the
basement
spike
comes
hopping
merrily
down
the
stairs
drusilla
i'm
home
when
he
reaches
the
bottom
he
breaks
out
into
a
pathetic
fit
of
giggles
which
quickly
turn
to
sobs
he
sniffs
a
few
times
and
wipes
his
nose
on
his
sleeve
he
sees
what's
left
of
the
burned
bed
and
steps
up
to
it
steadying
himself
on
a
pillar
in
despair
he
tosses
his
liquor
bottle
onto
the
bed
and
steps
around
the
column
from
there
he
sees
those
members
of
drusilla's
doll
collection
that
didn't
survive
the
fire
piled
on
her
dresser
all
badly
scorched
he
reaches
for
one
and
picks
it
up
the
features
on
its
fine
porcelain
face
can
still
be
made
out
but
the
paint
hair
and
dress
are
long
gone
he
stares
at
the
doll
intensely
why
did
you
do
it
baby
why
did
you
leave
me
we
were
happy
here
he
tries
to
suppress
a
sob
and
shakes
it
off
and
suddenly
he's
wearing
his
game
face
he
roars
at
the
doll
angrily
and
throws
it
hard
down
at
the
concrete
floor
he
spins
around
looking
for
something
to
smash
it
with
he
finds
a
tall
iron
candlestick
grabs
it
and
wields
it
back
you
spike
swings
the
candlestick
stupid
spike
swings
again
worthless
swings
again
bitch
calms
a
bit
look
what
you've
done
to
me
he
stares
down
at
what's
left
of
the
doll
its
delicate
porcelain
features
smashed
and
scattered
limbs
torn
and
singed
he
drops
the
iron
candlestick
on
top
of
it
cut
to
cordelia's
locker
in
the
halls
at
school
she
is
getting
what
she
needs
for
class
while
xander
tries
to
talk
her
into
the
double
date
thing
c'mon

be
fun
i
don't
know
i
just
thought
we
were
gonna
do
something
you
know
classy
what's
classier
than
bowling
cordelia
raises
her
eyebrows
at
him
apart
from
everything
ever
let's

down

the
swing
vote
xander
skips
around
to
her
other
side
i
guarantee
fun
cordelia
can't
help
but
give
him
a
warm
smile
and
giggle
from
his
new
vantage
point
xander
can
now
see
the
inside
of
her
locker
door

are
from
the
pier

three
pictures
of

sporting
a
huge
smile
and

theme
present

suddenly
disappointed

smiles
at

he
puts
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
briefly
and
then
heads
down
the
hall
to
class
willow
follows
him
with
her
gaze
for
a
moment
her
expression
showing
her
worry
about
the
levels
of
complexity
this
just
added
to
her
life
she
looks
down
at
the
pez
dispenser
cut
to
the
library
giles
looks
over
buffy's
sat
score
report
while
she
plays
with
a
contraption
from
giles'
huge
pile
of
camping
equipment
and
clothing
laid
out
on
the
big
table

down
where

this
retreat
thingy
the
yukon
buffy
reaches
for
something
else
it's
quite
nearby
actually
giles
buffy
finds
a
compass
it's
um
it's
the
clearing
at
the
top
of
breaker's
woods
buffy
opens
the
compass
and
sees
that
there
is
a
mirror
inside
the
lid
she
quickly
checks
her
hair
it's
the
site
of
some
fascinating
druidic
rituals
buffy
closes
the
compass
okay
but
you're
just
going
for
a
few
days
right
buffy
giles
takes
the
compass
from
her
i

refrigerator
buffy
puts

hellmouth
too
long
that
was
metaphorical
yes

giles
smiles
in

over
to
the

about

willow

man
xander
strokes
her
hair

trips
over
one
of
the
flower
beds
falls
into
it
and
passes
out
cut
to
dawn
the
first
red
rays
of
the
sun
appear
over
the
hills
and
shine
into
the
atrium
spike
lies
in
shadow
but
his
left
hand
is
extended
away
from
his
body
and
a
beam
of
light
nears
it
as
the
sun
rises
soon
his
hand
is
fully
exposed
to
the
light
and
it
begins
to
smoke
a
couple
of
seconds
later
it
bursts
into
flame
the
new
light
source
shines
into
spike's
face
and
he
wakes
and
sees
his
hand
aflame
whoa
he
leaps
to
his
feet
and
runs
over
to
the
fountain
screaming
all
the
way
he
holds
his
hands
under
it
but
it's
going
at
just
a
trickle
quickly
he
bends
down
and
jams
his
hand
into
the
pool
of
water
at
its
base
dousing
the
flames
no
sooner
is
that
problem
gone
than
he
realizes
he's
standing
in
shaded
but
direct
sunlight
and
he's
beginning
to
smoke
elsewhere
he
pulls
at
his
heavy
overcoat
trying
to
shade
his
face
as
he
scrambles
up
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
atrium
cut
to
inside
spike's
car
the
rear
driver's
side
door
whips
open
and
spike
dives
in
right
on
top
of
a
huge
pile
of
empty
beer
cans
liquor
bottles
and
other
trash
he
quickly
slams
the
door
shut
and
grabs
a
bottle
from
the
front
seat
he
pulls
the
cork
out
with
his
teeth
and
pours
a
generous
splash
over
his
burned
hand
he
grunts
loudly
in
pain
and
takes
a
good
drink
the
immediate
emergency
taken
care
of
he
relaxes
a
bit
and
tries
to
catch
his
breath
this
is
just
too
much
cut
to
a
small
magic
shop
the
shopkeeper
hears
the
rear
door
close
and
goes
to
investigate
there
she
finds
spike
looking
through
one
of
her
books
did
you
come
in
through
the
back
yeah
i
need
a
curse
a
what
spike
exasperated
a
curse
y'know
something
nasty
boils
i
wanna
give
him
boils
all
over
his
face
you
know
dripping
pustules
let's
really
go
for
the
gusto
here
i'm
hearing
a
lot
of
negative
energy
and
i
bet
spike
interrupts
leprosy
alright
a
spell
that
makes
his
parts
fall
off
that
sounds
proper
we
don't
carry
shopkeeper
the
front
door
chimes
leprosy
she
turns
to
see
willow
come
in
through
the
front
door
would
you
excuse
me
a
moment
she
goes
to
help
her
new
customer
blessed
be
anything
in
particular
i
can
help
you
find
yeah
willow
holds
up
her
notepad
it's
all
here
on
the
list
willow
reads
down
the
list
skink
root
essence
of
rose
thorn
canary
feathers
aha
shopkeeper
smiles
a
love
spell
want
that
old
lover
to
come
back
to
you
shopkeeper
spike
is
suddenly
interested
in
their
conversation
are
you
sure
you
know
what
you're
doing
hon
willow
flustered
no
oh
i
mean
yes
i
i
know
how
to
do
a
love
spell
but
this
is
more
of
an
antilove
spell
yeah
uh
kind
of
a
de
lusting
the
supplies
are
basically
the
same
right
shopkeeper
smiles
basically
shopkeeper
starts
to
gather
things
although
raven
feathers
tend
to
breed
a
little
more
discontent
than
canary
let
me
just
get
some
things
she
gathers
some
bags
of
herbs
jars
of
root
powders
a
feather
and
whatever
else
and
brings
them
all
to
the
counter
spike
watches
intently
from
behind
the
bookcase
okay
mmhmm
shopkeeper
adds
it
up
that'll
be
1580
for
the
lot
she
bags
it
all
while
willow
pulls
out
her
money
thanks
she
takes
the
bag
and
leaves
the
shopkeeper
turns
her
attention
back
to
spike
and
walks
back
to
where
she
left
him
shopkeeper
smiling
so
did
you
find
a
spell
book
spike
jumps
out
from
behind
the
bookcase
all
vamped
out
and
grabs
her
around
the
neck
the
shopkeeper
gasps
in
fright
but
can't
bring
herself
to
scream
forget
the
book
he
leans
in
for
the
bite
and
they
collapse
to
the
floor
when
he's
sucked
her
dry
he
looks
back
up
at
the
door
where
he
saw
willow
go
i
just
got
a
better
idea
part
2

sunnydale
city
hall
cut
to
the
mayor's
office
the
camera
is
low
to
the
floor
mayor
wilkins
is
practicing
his
putting
in
the
company
of
his
assistant
allan
he
taps
the
ball
and
it
comes
at
the
camera
in
a
nearly
perfect
straight
line
just
missing
its
target
oh
look
at
that
every
time
cuts
to
the
left
he
gets
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
to
check
the
lie
of
the
floor
see
and
it's
not
the
carpet
it's
me
mayor
wilkins
gets
up
to
retrieve
his
ball
i
swear
i
would
sell
my
soul
for
a
decent
short
game
mayor
wilkins
drops
the
ball
for
another
try
of
course
mayor
wilkins
chuckles
it's
a
little
late
for
that
mayor
wilkins
chuckles
mayor
wilkins
to
allan
i
don't
suppose
i
could
offer
your
soul
huh
really
help
me
on
the
green
allan
gives
him
a
shocked
look
i'm
just
funning
so
we
have
a
spike
problem
do
we
mayor
wilkins
takes
another
shot
he's
been
spotted
back
in
town
the
mayor's
shot
is
on
target
this
time
but
comes
up
short
he
lets
out
a
frustrated
sigh
and
goes
to
retrieve
his
ball
and
there
was
an
incident
at
a
magic
shop
in
broad
daylight
police
had
a
hell
of
a
time
covering
it
up
mayor
wilkins
drops
the
ball
mayor
wilkins
laughs
well
yes
y'know
he
was
up
to
all
sorts
of
shenanigans
last
year
we
had
a
world
of
fun
trying
to
guess
what
he'd
do
next
i
remember
allan
leans
against
the
mayor's
desk
the
mayor
whistles
at
allan
who
immediately
stands
back
up
but
i
guess
we're
past
that
now
this
year
is
too
important
to
let
a
loose
cannon
rock
the
boat
should
i
have
mr
trick
send
a
committee
to
deal
with
this
loose
cannon
rock
the
boat
is
that
a
mixed
metaphor
allan
confused
uh
mayor
wilkins
musing
out
loud
boats
did
have
cannons
and
a
loose
one
would
cause
it
to
rock
oh
honestly
i
don't
know
where
my
mind
goes
these
days
mayor
wilkins
chuckles
why
don't
you
take
care
of
that
spike
problem
a
committee
like
you
said
as
good
as
done
allan
leaves
the
office
that's
swell
fore
he
takes
another
shot
and
this
one
is
directly
on
target
he
spreads
his
arms
elated
hey
cut
to
angel's
mansion
he
places
another
log
on
the
fire
buffy
is
on
the
couch
with
a
pile
of
brochures
on
her
lap
college
huh
higher
education
kind
of
an
intense
proposition
where
do
you
wanna
go
angel
slowly
comes
over
to
her
buffy
closes
her
brochure
i
have
no
idea
my
mom
was
the
one
that
got
all
these
she's
so
excited
she
can't
stop
talking
about
it
buffy
angel
sits
across
from
her
i
had
a
really
hard
time
coming
up
with
an
alibi
so
i
could
come
over
here
she
doesn't
know
about
me
big
no
she's
having
enough
trouble
dealing
with
the
slayer
issue
i
don't
think
she's
ready
to
process
the
information
that
you
and
i
are
friends
again
anyway
i
think
this
college
jones
is
just
a
reaction
to
the
whole
slayer
thing
she
wants
you
to
get
out
someplace
a
little
less
hellmouthy
buffy
nods
she
has
a
point
buffy
draws
a
breath
y'know
but
there
are
reasons
to
stay
too
what
are
they
buffy
taken
aback
um
you
know
there's
my
slayer
duties
obviously
what
do
you
think
i
should
do
as
a
friend
i
angel
stands
up
i
think
that
you
should
leave
angel
goes
to
the
fireplace
this
is
a
good
opportunity
for
you
he
leans
against
the
cold
stone
facing
away
from
her
buffy
gets
up
to
gather
her
brochures
yeah
it's
not
like
there's
any
great
thing
keeping
me
here
she
stuffs
them
into
her
bag
angel
turns
around
when
he
hears
the
papers
rustling
buffy
zips
her
bag
closed
and
pulls
it
onto
her
shoulder
thanks
for
the
advice
it's
another
perspective
to
consider
where
are
you
going
you
just
got
here
it's
early
yeah
well
my
mom
starts
worrying
a
lot
earlier
these
days
i'll
stop
by
soon
she
leaves
without
looking
back
angel
watches
until
she's
gone
cut
to
the
science
room
at
school
it's
dark
willow
is
grinding
the
ingredients
for
the
antilove
spell
in
a
ceramic
bowl
xander
walks
into
the
dark
room
and
heads
toward
willow
whoa
it
smells
like
church
in
here
xander
sniffs
no
wait
evil
church
it's
just
chemistry
stuff
an
experiment
so
you
said
when
you
called
why
do
i
have
to
be
here
it'll
help
you
on
the
exam
you're
way
behind
but
that's
why
you
love
me
right
xander
bobs
his
head
academically
dangerous
willow
ignores
his
comment
here
willow
hands
him
a
raven
feather
hold
this
a
feather
and
who
will
i
be
tickling
he
runs
it
along
willow's
check
and
for
a
moment
she
enjoys
it
and
giggles
but
her
rational
mind
quickly
takes
over
and
she
gruffly
nudges
his
hand
aside
willow
warningly
shush
xander
isn't
too
happy
about
that
but
knows
it
has
to
be
that
way
willow
checks
her
spell
book
okay
bring
mixture
to
a
boil
she
lights
the
bunsen
burner
below
a
flask
of
liquid
i
assume
this
isn't
going
to
make
us
late
for
our
evening
of
bowling
magic
willow
jerks
up
there's
no
magic
i
mean
bowling
yeah
cordelia
and
oz
are
gonna
meet
us
here
later
can
we
turn
these
lights
on
he
notices
something
familiar
about
the
book
willow
is
working
from
and
steps
around
her
to
get
a
better
look
is
that
a
spell
book
willow
tries
to
obscure
it
with
her
hand
no
no
no
chemistry
book
wait
a
minute
this
is
love
spell
stuff
you're
doing
a
love
spell
no
of
course
not
this
is
a
purely
scientific
xander
picks
the
book
up
and
shows
her
its
title
witchcraft
delusting
spell
for
us
i
thought
it
would
go
better
if
you
didn't
know
xander
raises
his
voice
are
you
nuts
or
have
you
forgotten
that
i
tend
to
have
bad
luck
with
these
sorts
of
spells
willow
raises
hers
back
but
you
said
you
wished
that
these
feelings
could
just
go
away
yeah
i
wish
for
a
lot
of
things
i
told
you
i
wished
i
was
a
fireman
when
we
were
in
sixth
grade
but
you
didn't
follow
through
on
that
i
can't
do
this
anymore
xander
i
mean
this
whole
'us'
thing
is
bleagh
so
do
you
really
need
to
resort
to
the
black
arts
to
keep
our
hormones
in
check
willow
calmly
at
this
point
i'm
thinking
'no'
i'm
gonna
get
the
lights
xander
walks
clean
this
place
up
before
they
get
here
xander
clicks
them
on
and
start
asking
questions
spike
walks
into
the
room
behind
him
and
grabs
him
around
the
neck
xander
spike
starts
to
choke
xander
who
struggles
hard
but
can't
get
free

the
little
girl

xander
kicks
out
with
his
legs
against
the
wall
and
shoves
spike
and
himself
across
the
room
and
into
a
metal
shelf
spike
isn't
fazed
and
throws
xander
aside
to
the
floor
he
tries
to
get
up
but
spike
punches
him
hard
willow
grabs
a
microscope
and
comes
at
spike
with
it
he
stops
her
in
midswing
threatening
me
that's
not
nice
spike
xander
gets
back
up
we're
all

be
very
best
friends
he
yanks
the
microscope
from
willow's
grips
and
swings
it
around
into
xander's
temple
the
boy
goes
down
out
cold
xander
cut
to
spike's
factory
xander
is
laid
out
on
what's
left
of
drusilla's
bed
willow
nervously
sits
on
the
edge
fidgeting
with
her
hands
spike
dumps
a
box
full
of
supplies

he
drops

broken
bottle

around
willow
and
sits
down

care
enough
to
cut
off
my
head
or
set
me
on
fire
spike
sniffs
i
mean
is
that
too
much
to
ask
you
know
some
little
sign
that
she
cared
he
pauses
for
a
moment
to
inhale
and
exhale
deeply
it
was
that
truce
with
buffy
that
did
it
dru
said
i'd
gone
soft
wasn't
demon
enough
for
the
likes
of
her
and
i
told

was
thinking
of

the
whole
time

a
chaos
demon

looks
at
willow's
pretty
young
face
and
strokes
her
silky
auburn
hair
she
only
did
it
to
hurt
me
spike
he
takes
his
hand
off
of
her
so
i
said
'i'm

and
she
said
'fine'
and
i
said
'yeah

and
then
she
said

said

spike
leans
over
and
sobs
on
willow's
shoulder

willow
tentatively
pats
his
knee
there

he
raises
his
head
and
looks
at

a
better
whiff
and
then

his
game
face

willow
looks
at

spike
points
at
his
temple
love
isn't
brains
children
it's
blood
spike
clasps
his
chest
blood
screaming
inside
you
to
work
its
will
neither
buffy
nor
angel
want
to
hear
this
i
may
be
love's
bitch
but
at
least
i'm
man
enough
to
admit
it
he
turns
his
attention
back
to
finding
willow's
ingredients
buffy's
eyes
almost
meet
angel's
but
she
quickly
averts
them
spike
spots
what
he's
looking
for
hmm
spike
grabs
the
bottle
eye
of
rat
cut
to
the
basement
at
spike's
factory
willow
is
pounding
against
the
door
with
her
shoulder
letting
out
a
good
grunt
each
time
after
several
hits
she
hears
xander
moan
below
she
comes
down
to
the
bed
to
check
on
him
the
side
of
his
head
is
covered
in
dried
blood
xander
willow
sits
on
the
bed
are
you
okay
he
tries
to
sit
up
dizzy
xander
winces
kind
of
nauseous
too
do
i
remember
having
a
fight
with
spike
you
do
he
feels
the
caked
blood
on
the
side
of
his
face
i
won
right
kicked
his
ass
you
were
real
brave
do
you
need
to
barf
no
i'll
be
okay
xander
looks
around
where
are
we
the
factory
we're
locked
in
the
basement
that
burntout
place
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
so
we're
pretty
much
in
a
'scream
all
you
want'
scenario
pretty
much
why
didn't
he
just
kill
us
hehe
wants
me
to
do
a
love
spell
what
drusilla
broke
up
with
him
gee
and
we
had
all
hoped
those
crazy
kids
would
make
it
work
he's
out
of
control
i
mean
not
that
he
was
joe
restraint
in
the
old
days
xander
tries
again
to
sit
up
so
what
are
our
options
xander
winces
well
i
figure
either
i
refuse
to
do
the
spell
and
he
kills
us
or
i
do
the
spell
and
he
kills
us
give
me
a
third
option
he's
so
drunk
he
forgets
about
us
and
we
starve
to
death
that's
sort
of
the
best
one
will
we're
not
gonna
die
xander
tries
to
get
up
willow
helps
if
he's
so
drunk
he'll
get
sloppy
and
then
i'll
make
my
move
xander
they
collapse
back
onto
the
bed
as
long
as
my
move
doesn't
involve
standing
up
or
using
my
limbs
we'll
be
okay
their
fall
put
them
very
close
to
each
other
and
the
temptation
to
kiss
is
strong
we're
not
supposed
to
exemption
for
impending
death
situation
willow
goes
along
with
that
and
they
kiss
xander
reaches
his
arm
around
her
as

lies
back

puts
her
arm
around

close
behind
