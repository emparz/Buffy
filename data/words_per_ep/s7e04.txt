she's
giving

great
advice
absolutely
those
kids
are
lucky
to
have
buffy
looking
out
for
them
i
just
wish
she
believed
it
she's
still
stressing
over
the
whole
dropped
out

college
not
actually
qualified
thing
plus
the
salivating
hellmouth

whole—

it
does

body
good
i
know
it's
gonna
be
bad
it's
gonna
be
real
bad
and
i
wonder
will
i—
well
if
it
comes—
when
it
comes
will
i
be
able
to
help
i
think
so
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
what
i
can
do
i
mean
frankly
i'm—i'm
scared
of
what
i
might
do
yeah
i
get
that
figuring
out
how
to
control
your
magic
seems
a
lot
like
hammering
a
nail
xander
willow
looks
confused
well
uh
hear
me
out
so
you're
hammering
right
ok
well
at
the
end
of
the
hammer
you
have
the
power
but
no
control
it
takes
like
two
strokes
to
hit
the
nail
in
or
you
could
hit
your
thumb
ouch
so
you
choke
up
control
but
no
power
it
could
take
like
ten
strokes
to
knock
the
nail
in
power
control
it's
a
tradeoff
that's
actually
not
a
bad
analogy
thanks
except
i'm
less
worried
about
hitting
my
thumb
and
more
worried
about
going
all
blackeyed
baddy
and
bewitching
that
hammer
into
cracking
my
friends'
skulls
open
like
coconuts

ouch

that
you

me
about
this
and
second
of
all
you
should
know
that
there
is
nothing
shameful
about
being
gay
nothing
ii
know
it's
just—i'm
not
positive
so
uh
i
was
thinking

why
don't
you
go
on
uh
a
date
with
me

listening
in
on
a
conversation
between
cassie
and
guy
friend
what're
you
drawing
don't
you
have
a
history
test
to
study
for
when
are
you
gonna
design
me
a
tattoo
a
tattoo
oh
right
i
could
imagine
that
come
on
design
something
i
mean
maybe
we
could
get
matching
tattoos
how
'bout
like
a
snake
with
fire
coming
out
of
its
mouth
hmm
or
a
sexy
hula
girl
who
wiggles
when
you
flex
yeah
now
you're
talking
sexy
hula
girl
but
a
sexy
snake
hula
girl
dawn
is
pretending
to
read
a
book
while
casually
making
her
way
toward
their
conversation
cassie
chuckles
you
are
so
ridiculous
so
i
was
thinking
maybe
we
should
go
to
that
dance
after
all
what
do
you
mean
after
all
i
told
you
i
don't
wanna
go
well
i
assumed
you
were
kidding
it
would
probably
be
lame
anyways
dawn's
standing
behind
them
now
well
yeah
but
lame
is
funny…
and
you
know
maybe
fun
if
you
know
we're
hanging
out
together
we
hang
out
together
all
the
time
right
and
therefore
we
should
hang
out
together
at

write
it
down
i
think
something
to
do
with
glazes
as
scintillating
as
the
pottery
talk
is
i'd
better
actually
go
study
mike
gathers
his
things
and
stands
to
dawn
i'm
mike
by
the
way
hi

is
reading
kurt

five
dawn
sits
down
beside

in
the

mike
vacated
so
um
is
that
any
good
yeah
actually
yeah
what
do
you
have
to
read
it
for
oh
just
for
me
i
guess
i
kinda
stopped
reading
my
homework
assignments
i
just
read
what
i
want
that's
so
cool
i'd
do
that
but
my
sister'd
be
down
my
neck
in
a
second
summers
hey—
are
you
the
counselor's
little
sister
no
she's
my
sister
lucky
me

no
no
she'sshe's

i
actually
just
saw
her
this
morning
oh
really
what
about
dawn
beat
uh
i'm
sorry
that's
none
of
my
business
no
i
don't
care
so
mike's
a
cutie
are
you

good
grades
good
kid
then
all
of
a
sudden
not
so
good
grades
absenteeism
comments
about
apathy
and
depression—
so
the
question
is
what
changed
right
if
she
did
have
some
sort
of
psychic
vision
that
would
explain
it
do
you
really
think
this

of
coffee
i'm
not
saying
you
don't
have
slayer
grace
but
it's

maybe
just
maybe
you're
trying
so
hard
to
help
that
you're
seeing
paranormal

buy
no
time
i
hear
the
chatter
of
the
bugs
it's
they
alone
will
feast
meanwhile
dawn
has
come
home
ok
death
is
really
on
her
brain
we
all
deal
with
death
this
girl
isn't
just
dealing
she's
giving
death
a
long
sloppy
wordkiss
she
has
a
yen
for
the
big
dirtnap
i
don't

i
mean
a
lot
of
teens

some
pretty
angsty
