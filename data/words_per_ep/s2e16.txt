the
cemetery
at
night
the
camera
is
focused
on
a
heartshaped
locket
that
xander
is
dangling
in
the
extreme
foreground
so
that
everything
in
the
distance
is
out
of
focus
and
unrecognizable
so
what
do
you
think
the
camera
shifts
its
focus
onto
buffy
sitting
on
a
gravestone
it's
nice
cut
to
a
fullview
shot
of
them
they
are
waiting
near
a
fresh
grave
xander
approaches
buffy
still
dangling
the
locket
but
do
you
think
cordelia
will
like
it
i
don't
know
she
pulls
it
toward
herself
with
her
hand
to
take
a
closer
look
does
she
know
what
one
of
these
is
he
yanks
it
out
of
her
hand
and
puts
it
and
his
hands
into
his
jacket
pockets
xander
chuckles
okay
big
yuks
when
are
you
guys
gonna
stop
making
fun
of
me
for
dating
cordelia
i'm
sorry
but
never
buffy
xander
nods
smiles
and
looks
down
i
just
think
you
could
find
somebody
more
better
uh
parallel
universe
maybe
xander
looks
up
here
the
only
other
person
i'm
interested
in
is
um
unavailable
besides
cordy
and
i
are
really
getting
along
we're
not
fighting
as
much
and
yesterday
we
just
sat
together
not
even
speakin'
you
know
just
uh
enjoying
comfortable
silence
xander
grins
and
laughs
then
loses
the
grin
and
exhales
man
that
was
dull
buffy
smiles
i'm
glad
that
you
guys
are
getting
along
buffy
facetiously
almost
really
reassuringly
and
don't
stress
over
the
gift
well
this
is
new
territory
for
me
i
mean
my
valentines
are
usually
met
with
heartfelt
restraining
orders
she'll
love
it
i
wish
dating
was
like
slaying
xander
steps
away
you
know
simple
direct
stake
to
the
heart
no
muss
no
fuss
he
turns
to
face
her
again
just
as
a
vampire
rises
from
the
fresh
grave
xander
reacts
quickly
and
jerks
back
as
the
newly
risen
demon
comes
for
him
but
he
trips
and
falls
backward
onto
his
butt
buffy
hops
off
of
the
gravestone
and
grabs
the
vampire
from
behind
as
he
is
about
to
grab
xander
and
throws
him
high
and
away
he
hits
the
ground
hard
his
momentum
carries
him
into
a
reverse
somersault
and
he
rolls
to
his
feet
he
starts
to
come
at
buffy
she
leaps
at
him
does
a
double
kick
to
his
chest
with
both
feet
in
rapid
succession
and
lands
upright
as
the
vampire
staggers
back
into
the
corner
column
of
a
small
mausoleum
buffy
comes
at
him
but
he
blocks
her
first
two
punches
and
ducks
a
third
swing
her
fourth
and
fifth
punches
however
land
on
his
face
but
he
isn't
fazed
he
pushes
her
aside
into
the
wall
of
the
mausoleum
and
after
regaining
his
balance
comes
at
her
again
she
slides
down
the
wall
and
kicks
out
with
her
leg
making
him
trip
and
spin
down
to
the
ground
as
he
gets
up
she
leaps
at
him
with
a
high
kick
and
knocks
him
back
down
again
she
reaches
into
her
jacket
for
a
stake
and
when
the
vampire
stands
back
up
again
and
tries
to
make
a
grab
for
her
she
deftly
plunges
it
into
his
chest
he
immediately
bursts
into
a
cloud
of
ashes
buffy
yanks
the
stake
back
and
watches
with
satisfaction
as
the
ash
rains
to
the
ground
then
she
heads
over
to
xander
and
gives
him
a
hand
back
up
to
his
feet
sorry
to
say
xand
slaying
is
a
tad
more
perilous
than
dating
they
start
out
of
the
cemetery
well
you're
obviously
not
dating
cordelia

smile
as

sees

at
xander
and
willow
and
then
starts
down
the
hall
the
other
way
cut
to
the
library
buffy
is
sitting
at
the
table
hugging
her
knee
while

brutal
displays

think
of
it
as
affection

suppose
like
what
no
no
uh
giles
gets
up
no
need
to
go
into
details
giles
steps
away
that
bad
giles
faces

few
nights
iii'll
um
giles
sits
across
from

i'll
patrol

and
bloody

down
at

angel
angelus
raises
his
eyebrows
at

and
lets
out
a
deep
breath
then
looks
back
up
at
angelus
i
knew

like
it
angelus
inhales
the
aroma

found
it
in
a
quaint
little
shopgirl

up
and
holds
it
out
to
have
a
look
at

around
drusilla's

so
much
easier
when

angelus
smiles
spike
controlling
his
anger
you
would
do
well
to
worry
less
about
dru
spike
angelus
rolls
his
eyes
and
more
about
that
slayer
you've
been
tramping
around
with
angelus
paces
behind
the
table
dear
buffy
i'm
still
trying
to
decide
the
best
way
to
send
my
regards
angelus
sits
on
the
table
why
don't
you
rip
her
lungs
out
it
might
make
an
impression

poetry

doesn't
have
to
spike
inhales
and
thinks
what
rhymes
with
lungs
don't
worry
spike
drusilla

out

to

buffy
stares
down
at
it
and
sees
a
dozen
red
roses
along
with
a
card
bearing
a
single
word
soon
her
mother
looks
up
at
her
with
a
little
smile
but
it
fades
when
she
sees
how
buffy
is
just
staring
down
at
the
card
without
saying
a
word
or
reacting
in
any
way
cut
to
the

the

coming
looks
at
him
and
stands
up
to
meet
him
the
song
is
over
now
hey
cordelia
looks
him
up
and
down
your
clothes
you
look
so
good
xander
looks
down
at
himself
oh
i
let
buffy
dress
me
xander
gets
a
confused
look
from
cordelia
well
not
physically
cordelia
upset
perfect
you
had
to
make
this
harder
didn't
you
okay
clearly
the
fact
that
i
please
you
visually
has
got
us
off
on
the
wrong
foot
here
xander
xander
stops
her
with
a
gesture
let
me
finish
i've
been
thinking
a
lot
about
us
lately
the
why
and
the
wherefore
you
know
once
twice
a
kissy
here
a
kissy
there
and
you
can
chalk
it
all
up
to
hormones
xander
cordelia
looks
puzzled
aand
maybe
that's
all
we
have
here
tawdry
teen
lust
but
maybe
not
maybe
something
in
you
sees
something
special
inside
me
xander
cordelia
looks
down
then
back
up
and
vice
versa
i
mean
i
think
i
do
see
something
so
he
pulls
out
the
jewelry
box
and
hands
it
to
her
she
takes
it
and
looks
up
at
him
xander
cordelia
opens
the
box
thank
you
cordelia
holds
up
the
necklace
and
pendant
it's
beautiful
cordelia
exhales
and
looks
at
him
i
wanna
break
up
xander
looks
at
her
in
disbelief
okay
not
quite
the
reaction
i
was
looking
for
cordelia
shaking
her
head
i
know
i'm
sorry
it's
just
who
are
we
kidding
cordelia
xander
looks
down
at
the
necklace
even
if
parts
of
us
do
see
specialness
we
don't
fit
xander
looks
up
suddenly
yeah
okay
xander
very
upset
do
you
know
what's
a
good
day
to
break
up
with
somebody
any
day
besides
valentine's
day
i
mean
what
were
you
running
low
on
dramatic
irony
cordelia
apologetically
i
know
i
didn't
mean
to
do
it
this
way
i
xander
interrupts
well
you
did
cordelia
gives
him
a
sorry
look
xander
stares
back
for
a
moment
then
turns
and
goes
away
cordelia
looks
down
at
the
pendant
cut
to
the
halls
at
school
the
next
day
xander
comes
moping
around
the
corner
a
boy
passes
him
in
the
halls
dude
jack
pats
xander's
shoulder
way
to
get
dumped
he
continues
down
the
hall
and
xander
does
the
same
he
looks
up
and
sees
buffy
coming
the
other
way
ooo
buffy
my
bud
xander
takes
her
hand
and
stops
her
you
will
not
believe
buffy
looks
at
him
can't
talk
right
now
angel
xander
lets
go
of
her
hand
do
you
need
help
it's
alright
she
quickly
resumes
her
rapid
trek
to
the
library
xander
watches
her
go
then
continues
down
the
hall
a
group
of
girls
passes
around
him
staring
and
giggling
at
him
he
exhales
and
watches
them
go
a
few
steps
further
along
he
hears
harmony
address
him
and
looks
over
at
her
gee
xander
maybe
you
should
learn
a
second
language
so
that
even
more
girls
can
reject
you
she
and
the
other
girls
around
her
laugh
to
his
face
xander
just
keeps
moping
along
a
moment
later
he
notices
amy
heading
toward
the
stairs
in
front
of
him
he
looks
back
for
an
instant
and
then
rushes
over
to
her
takes
her
by
the
arm
and
pulls
her
aside
what
are
you
doing
amy
good
to
see
you
xander
takes
a
quick
look
around
you're
a
witch
amy
glances
around
no
i'm
not
that
that

my
mom

amy
smiles
yeah

thinking
it
runs
in
the
family
i
saw
you
working
that
mojo
on
ms
beakman
xander
gestures
behind
himself
maybe
i
should
go
tell
somebody
about
that's
not
even
amy
angrily
that
is
so
mean
xander
glares
back
blackmail
is
such
an
ugly
word
i
didn't
say
blackmail
yeah
but
i'm
about
to
blackmail
you
so
i
thought
i'd
bring
it
up
amy
folds
her
arms

xander
chuckles
what

i
want
i
want

amy
xander
looks
back
at
cordelia
sitting
with
harmony
now
we're
gonna
cast
a
little
spell
amy
looks
past
him
at
cordelia
as
well
then
turns
her
eyes
up
at
him
part
2

an
empty
classroom
xander
closes
the
door
behind
himself
as
he
follows
amy
in
a
love
spell
yeah

just
the
basic
can't
eat
can't
sleep
can't
breathe

little
old
moi
well
that
kind
of
thing
is
the
hardest
i
mean
to
make
someone
love
you
for
all
eternity
xander
waves
his
hand
and
shakes
his
head
whoa
whoa
back
up
who
said
anything
about
eternity
a
man
can
only
talk
selftanning
lotion
for
so
long
before
his
head
explodes
well
then
i
don't
get
it
if
you
don't
wanna
be
with
her
forever
then
what's
the
point
the
point
is

want
her
to
want
me

same
hell

xander
points
to
her
locker
with
his
eyes
i
can
wait
she
gives
him
another
look
then
goes
over
to
her
locker
xander
steps
to
the
side
of
the
hall
and
leans
against
the
lockers
about
ten
feet
from
her
he
watches
the
people
passing
by
as
she
works
her
combination
she
opens
the
locker
and
sets
down
a
book
she
glances
over
at
him
to
see
if
he's
looking
satisfied
that
he's
not
paying
close
attention
she
leans
in
behind
the
door
exhales
reaches
under
the
collar
of
her
blouse
and
pulls
the
necklace
and
pendant
out
xander
just
keeps
looking
around
the
hall
she
undoes
the
clasp
takes
it
off
and
lets
out
a
deep
breath
she
closes
her
locker
steps
over
to
him
and
hands
him
the
necklace
here

a
good
thing

i
don't

xander
just
gives
her
a
look
and
leaves
cut
to
the
school
that
night
cut
to
the
science
lab
xander
is
holding
a
candle
and
sitting
barechested
and
crosslegged
on
the
floor
inside
a
large
red
symbol
for
woman
painted
on
the
floor
three
red
vertical
stripes
are
painted
on
his
chest
amy
is
at
a
lab
table
where
she's
waving
the
locket
over
her
witch's
brew
which
is
boiling
in
a
beaker
over
a
bunsen
burner
diana
goddess
of
love
and
the
hunt
i
pray
to
thee
let
my
cries
bind
the
heart
of
xander's
beloved
amy
lowers
the
necklace
into
the
brew
may
she
neither
rest
nor
sleep
amy
the
brew
sparks
until
she
submits
to
his
will
only
the
flame
of
the
burner
becomes
huge
as
the
power
of
the
spell
emanates
from
the
beaker
and
swirls
above
it
and
between
her
hands
diana
bring
about
this
love
and
bless
it
the
swirls
of
energy
begin
to
return
to
the
beaker
and
disappear
amy
to
xander
blow
out
the
candle
now
the
spell's
power
has
dissipated
xander
blows
out
the
candle
and
the
screen
goes
black
cut
to
the
school
the
next
morning
cut
to
the
hall
outside
the
lounge
xander
sees
cordelia
and
her
friends
sitting
at
a
table
and
goes
over
to
them
with
confidence
he
rests
one
hand
on
the
table
and
leans
over
it
next
to
cordelia
looking
around
at
all
the
girls
and
giving
them
a
smile
cordelia
looks
up
at

cordelia
looks
back

in
through
the
window
at
buffy
for
a
second
and
then
gives
his
attention
to
amy

always
try
again
he
looks

looking
out
at
him
i
am
still
pretty
new
at

him
with

sees
buffy
staring
out
at

with
her
finger
between
her
lips
we
can
just
hang
out

xander
looks
at
amy

he
looks
in
at
buffy
again
she's
still
staring
out
at
him
playing
with
her
hair
between
her
lips
exactly
so

another
girl
approaches
them
in
the
hall
hi
xander
what
you're
in
mr
baird's
history
class
right

were
talking
the
two
girls
glare
at
each
other
xander
begins
to
worry
uh
i
really
gotta
go

he
heads
down
the
hall
away
from
them
they
both
just
watch
him
go
cut
to
xander's
room
at
home
he
barges
in
and
slams
the
door
behind
him
he
calms
down

bit

the
few
steps
over
to
his
bed
and
sits
on
it
behind

up
from

the
covers
wearing
one
of
his
shirts
and
touches
him
on
the
back
xander
jumps
up
in
surprise

of
backfired

friends
xander
very
nervous
a
long
long
time
too
long
to
do
anything
that
might
change
that
now
willow
moves
to
the
edge
of
the
bed
well
friendships
change
all
the
time
people
grow
apart
they
grow
closer
willow
smiles
up
at
him
uh

very
comfortable
with
this
amount
of
closeness

xander
points
behind
himself
i
can
even
back
up
a
few
paces
and
still
be
happy
xander
steps
back

xander
smiles
still
nervous

gets
up
from
the
bed
and
approaches
him

willow
leans
into
him

wigged
at
hitting
on
one
of
my
friends
that
she's
repressing
she's
getting
pretty
good
at
that
i
should
probably
start
worrying
well
i'm
back
to
being
incredibly
unpopular

better
than
everyone
trying
to
axmurder
you
right
mostly
but
uh
willow
won't
even
talk
to
me
any
particular
reason
she
should

a
month
at

stop
and
face
each
other
xander

you
before

invoked
the
great
roofie
spirit
the
rest
of
us
you
remember
huh

a
sudden
need
for
cheese
i
also
remember
that
you
didn't
need
cheese
undress
me
it
meant
a
