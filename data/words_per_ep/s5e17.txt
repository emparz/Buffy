preference
not
to
have
one
there's
no
wake
mom
didn't
like
them
she
said
that

grave
with
a
small
frown
on

behind
her
shot
of

both
staring
at
the

but
she
nods
slightly
and
slips
her
hand
into

holding
hands
cut
to

and
tara's
dorm
room
dawn
lies
on

sleeping
bag
on
the
floor
with

crouched
on

dawn
goes
over
to
a
low
table
where
the
magical
supplies
are
laid
out
good
'cause
i
know
what
i
wanna
do
now

willow
she
and

stuffed
animal
dance
i
wanna

a
spell
i
wanna
bring
mom
back
shot
of
willow
and
tara
looking
concerned
shot
of
dawn
looking
determined
blackout
act
ii

fade
in
on
anya
and
xander
in
bed
anya
is
on
top
of
xander
both
covered
by
sheets
mm
anya
breathing
heavily
lies
down
and
puts
her
head
on
xander's
chest
that
was
different
xander
breathing
heavily
yeah
it
was
more
intense
anya
nods
it's
because
of
joyce
right
xander
pause
huh
well
she
got
me
thinking
about
how
people
die
all
the
time
and
how
they
get
born
too
and
how
you
kind
of
need
one
so
you
can
have
the
other
when
i
think
about
it
that
way
it
makes
death
a
little
less
sad
and
sex
a
little
more
exciting
again
i
say
huh
well
i
just
think
i
understand
sex
more
now
it's
not
just
about
two
bodies
smooshing
together
it's
about
life
anya
xander
looks
a
little
alarmed
it's
about
making
life
xander
alarmed
right
when
two
people
are
much
older
and
way
richer
and
far
less
stupid
anya
lifts
her
head
to
look
at
him
laughs
breathe
you're
turning
colors
i'm
not
ready
to
make
life
with
you
but
i
could
we
could
life
could
come
out
of
our
love
and
our
smooshing
and
that's
beautiful
anya
xander
looks
relieved
it
all
makes
me
feel
like
i'm
part
of
something
bigger
like
i'm
more
awake
somehow
anya
smiles
you
know
yeah
i
do
he
lifts
his
head
and
they
kiss
cut
to
willow
and
tara
still
reacting
to
dawn
tara
steps
forward
of
course
you
wanna
bring
your
mother
back
and
i
wish
we
could
but
it's
not
possible
why
you
guys
do
magic
for
all
kinds
of
things
we
do
but
this
is
different
magic
can't
be
used
to
alter
the
natural
order
of
things
but
all
you
do
is
mess
with
the
natural
order
of
things
you
you
make
things
float
aand
disappear
and
but
we
don't
mess
with
life
and
death
tara
shot
of
willow
looking
upset
dawn
i
know
how
bad
you
hurt
you
don't
dawn
upset
they
put
her
in
the
ground
they
did
and
it's
awful
and
unfair
but
this
isn't
the
way
i'm
not
even
sure
it's
possible
dawn
i
mean
i've
seen
things
on
resurrection
but
there's
books
and
stuff
but
i
guess
the
spells
backfire
that's
not
the
point
that's
not
the
point
the
the
point
is
it's
bad
because

because
witches
can't
be
allowed
to
alter
the
fabric
of
life
for
selfish
reasons
wiccans
took
an
oath
a
long
time
ago
to
honor
that
so
it's
possible
to
bring
someone
back
they
wouldn't
have
taken
an
oath
if
thy
didn't
know
they
could
do
it
maybe
they
could
but
we
can't
she's
right
dawn
it's
too
dangerous
you
said
you
wanted
to
help
me
dawn
makes
an
annoyed
sound
and
goes
to
lie
down
on
her
sleeping
back
with
her
back
turned
willow
kneels
beside
her
dawn
willow
touches
dawn's
shoulder
but
she
jerks
away
turns
over
so
her
back
is
to
willow
again
willow
looks
over
at
tara
tara
looks
concerned
cut
to
graveyard
night
pan
across
trees
and
graves
we
discover
buffy
and
angel
sitting
on
the
ground
under
a
tree
leaning
against
it
buffy
has
her
legs
curled
under
her
and
leans
against
angel's
shoulder
they
both
look
at
the
grave
as
they
talk
the
funeral
was

buffy
sighs
it
was
brutal
but
it's
tomorrow
that
i'm
worried
about
what's
tomorrow
that's
exactly
what
i
don't
know
up
until
now
i
i've
had
a
road
map
things
to
do
every
minute
having
to
do
with
mom
tomorrow
the
stuff
of
everyday
living
resumes
and
everybody
expects
me
to
know
how
to
do
it
because

buffy
sarcastically
i'm
so
strong
you
just
need
some
time
i'm
sure
everybody
understands
that
time's
not
the
issue
i
can
stick
wood
in
vampires
but
mom
was
the
strong
one
in
real
life
she
always
knew
how
to
make
things
better
just
what
to
say
yeah
you'll
find
your
way
i
mean
not
all
at
once
but
buffy
shakes
her
head
i
don't
know
i
keep
thinking
about
it
when
i
found
her
if
i
had
just
gotten
there
ten
minutes
earlier
you
said
they
told
you
it
wouldn't
have
made
a
difference
they
said
probably
wouldn't
have
made
a
difference
the
exact
thing
they
said
was
probably
i
haven't
told
that
to
anyone
doesn't
make
it
your

and
runs
offscreen

to
a
magic
guy

spike
closes
the
door
the
camera
pulls
back
so
we
can
see
piles
of
books
and
papers
all
over
a
table
hey
we
see
a
door
leading
into
another
room
partly
obscured
by
a
curtain
behind
the
curtain
there's
a
figure
standing
anybody
home
the
figure
moves
through
the
curtains
spike
and
dawn
look
apprehensive
the
figure
emerges
and
turns
out
to
be
a
small
elderly
man
wearing
glasses
and
a
bathrobe

looks
surprised
to
see
them
i
know

shakes
her
head

suddenly
he
reaches
out
and
pulls
some
hair
from
dawn's
head
she
gasps
ow
spike
steps
forward
but
doesn't
do
anything
doc
takes
the
hair
over
to
a
lamp
and
holds
it
up
to
the
light
dawn
gives
spike
an
angry
look
holding
the
side
of
her
head
well
your
mother's
a
good
candidate
at
least
strong
dna
right
doc
turns
and
begins
examining
the
stuff
on
his
shelves
he
hums
the
theme
from
prokofiev's
peter
and
the
wolf
dawn
watches
shot
of
doc
with
his
back
turned
from
underneath
his
bathrobe
a
greenish
scaly
tail
pokes
out
dawn
sees
it
and
her
eyes
widen
she
turns
to
spike
but
he
is
lighting
a
cigarette
and
by
the

willow
anxiously

iit's
just
a
history
book
iit
might
answer
some
of
her
questions
ii
don't
think
she
could
do
any
harm
with
that
stuff
could
she
well
it's
not
a
howto
guide
but
it
refers
to
specific
resurrection
spells
and
potions
but
ii
didn't
i
mean
hey
how'd
she
know
that
ii
don't
know
but
god
what
else
did
she
take
nothing
ii
think
i
think
n
she
took
nothing
else
but
maybe
she
did
and
we
should
probably
look
because
who
knows
