prologue

fade
in
to
room
214
in
stevenson
hall
it
is
night
soft
music
is
playing
interior
is
dark
except
for
buffy's
bedside
lamp
and
riley
and
buffy
can
be
seen
lying
on
her
bed
above
the
covers
making
out
riley
between
kisses
we're
not
expecting
anyone
are
we
willow
said
she
was
going
to
be
at
the
science
library
all
night
is
that
right
they
resume
on
the
brink
of
steven
bochco
territory
riley
slips
his
hand
up
the
back
of
buffy's
shirt
and
begins
to
lift
it
but
willow
pisses
off
most
of
the
male
viewers
as
well
as
some
of
the
female
viewers
by
barging
into
the
room
breaking
the
mood
uh
apparently
not
buffy
stands
up
and
straightens
her
shirt
willow
worried
we
got
trouble
buffy
serious
what
is
it
i
was
in
the
rec
room
it
came
through
the
window
vampire
vampires
don't
breathe
fire
cut
to
hallway
first
floor
buffy
willow
and
riley
round
the
corner
buffy
is
carrying
a
riflesize
crossbow
i
should
call
for
backup
no
time
she
hands
him
the
crossbow
and
motions
him
down
the
adjacent
hall
and
he
splits
from
them
towards
the
other
door
into
the
rec
room
buffy
arms
herself
with
a
stake
from
her
bag
she
does
not
look
happy
as
she
and
willow
head
for
the
door
we
have
to
make
this
fast
i
have
better
things
to
do
tonight
than
kill
opens
the
door
and
steps
inside
the
rec
room
which
is
in
total
darkness
a
second
later
the
lights
come
up
and
we
and
buffy
see
that
it
is
a
surprise
party
for
her
19th
birthday
says
the
large
banner
hanging
across
the
ceiling
and
a
crowd
of
people
yelling
surprise
which
buffy
is
and
quickly
hides
her
stake
riley
rushes
in
through
the
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
but
attention
is
on
buffy
so
he
hides
the
crossbow
without
anybody
noticing
it
in
the
crowd
we
see
xander
harris
anya
rupert
giles
and
several
other
faces
we
might
recognize
as
extras
from
previous
seasons
willow
smiling
guess
you
won't
be
killing
anything
tonight
after
all
buffy
sly
grin
don't
be
so
sure
wolf's
howl
opening
credits
and
theme
playing
part
one

fade
in
to
the
party
well
on
its
way
the
table
is
lined
with
cake
snacks
punch
etc
pan
to
giles
xander
and
anya
gathered
around
the
soccer
table
giles
has
a
paper
plate
with
cake
and
a
cup
of
punch
he's
talking
around
a
mouthful
of
cake
as
xander
and
anya
listen
to
him
yeah
this
is
a
lively
space
it's
like
the
activity
room
we
had
at
public
school
two
male
students
move
in
on
the
soccer
table
and
giles
picks
up
his
cup
and
steps
away
sorry
giles
chuckles
i
uh
one
time
i
uh
i
was
up
to
a
little
bit
of
a
prank
with
the
dart
board
anya
to
xander
i'm
bored
let's
eat
xander
sternly
anya
we've
talked
about
this
anya
to
giles
i'm
sorry
that
was
rude
please
continue
your
story
anya
seems
proud
of
herself
as
she
looks
to
xander
then
says
quietly
hopefully
it
involves
treacle
and
a
headmaster
giles
not
amused
go
and
eat
anya
hurries
off
and
xander
gives
giles
an
apologetic
look
before
following
cut
to
later
giles
is
sitting
in
a
chair
against
the
wall
alone
looking
a
bit
uncomfortable
as
the
party
continues
around
him
willow
walks
up
to
him
with
another
paper
plate
of
cake
willow
handing
him
the
plate

actually
miss
it
at
times

you're
retired
giles
frowns
i'm
sorry

personal
oh

have
already
moved
on
because
buffy
and
giles
are
alone
giles
still
seems
to
be
recovering
oh
he's
just
nervous
but
this
is
so
nice
having
everyone
together
for
my
birthday
of
course
you
could
smash
in
all
my
toes
with
a
hammer
and
it
will
still
be
the
bestest
buffy
birthday
bash
in
a
big
long
while
right
aaactually
willow
aaand
xander

all
the
planning
i'm
not
sure
i
would
have
gone
with
the
surprise
party
giles
smiles
you
know
you
have
enough
things
jumping
out
at
you
in
the
dark
professor
walsh
says
that
adrenaline
is
like
exercise
but
without
the
exorbitant
gym
fees
giles
a
beat
very
witty
you
should
meet
her
she's
absolutely
the
smartest
person
i've
ever
met
giles
feeling
a
bit
slighted
perhaps
we
should
have
invited
professor
walsh
to
the
party
giles
takes
of
sip
of
punch
oh
no
i
mean
she's
like
forty
she's
got
better
things
to
do
than
hang
out
with
a
bunch
of
kids
giles
feels
even
more
out
of
place
but
buffy
doesn't
pick
up
on
his
discomfort
riley
returns
with
another
piece
of
cake
and
hands
it
to
him
here
you
go
sir
on
giles'
expression
cut

exterior
of
harris
home
next
day

plain
looking
onestory
house
cut
to
interior
of
the
basement
abode
de
xander
spike
is
seen
walking
back
and
forth
as
if
looking
for
something
to
pack
in
his
bag
cigarette
in
his
mouth
xander
is
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
anya
is
lounging
on
the
recliner
browsing
a
comic
book
xander
impatiently
you
own
nothing
this
shouldn't
be
taking
so
long
hang
on
let
a
fella
get
organized
spike
sees
a
radio
and
picks
it
up
that's
my
radio
and
you're
what
shocked
and
disappointed
i'm
evil
anya
putting
comic
aside
so
what
kind
of
place
are
you
looking
for
i
don't
know
maybe
a
crypt
some
place
you
know
dark
and
dank
but
not
as
dark
and
dank
as
this
heh
it's
pretty
depressing
isn't
it
i've
known
corpses
with
a
fresher
smell
in
fact
i've
been
one
spike
flicks
is
cigarette
away
that's
it
let's
go
xander
marches
to
him
about
ready
to
drag
his
ass
out
wait
anya
gets
up
and
unplugs
the
tall
threehead
lamp
and
brings
it
over
to
him
i
want
to
give
you
something
for
your
new
place
that's
my
lamp
xander
takes
it
back
from
her
and
returns
it
to
its
original
spot
a
gift
is
traditional
i've
read
about
it
that's
among
friends
with
bitter
enemies
we
don't
give
them
my
lamp
it's
not
gonna
have
electricity
anyway
it's
a
crypt
remember
what
about
running
water
a
fridge
to
keep
your
blood
fresh
spike
a
beat
no
well
that's
gotta
suck
you
should
just
get
a
hotel
room
or
something
spike
considers
demon
girl's
got
a
point
i
need
fresh
blood
if
i
had
a
few
bob
for
a
room
with
an
honor
bar
out
before
i
get
the
slayer
over
here
to
kick
your
ass
out
spike
sighs
picks
up
his
long
coat
don't
know
why
she
didn't
come
say
goodbye
shed
a
few
tears
well
she
has
an
appointment
with
somebody
who's
actually
still
scary
cut
to
professor
walsh's
office
walsh
is
sitting
behind
her
desk
and
has
a
serious
expression
on
her
face
so
the
slayer
yeah
that's
me
buffy
is
sitting
in
front
of
walsh's
desk
looking
a
tad
nervous
with
riley
standing
slightly
behind
her
left
shoulder
we
thought
you
were
a
myth
well
you
were
mythtaken
buffy
smiles
but
sees
that
neither
are
gonna
laugh
and
stops
and
to
think
all
that
time
you
were
sitting
in
my
class
well
most
of
those
times
i
always
knew
you
could
do
better
than
a
b
minus
now
i
understand
your
energies
were
directed
in
the
same
places
as
ours
in
fact
it's
only
our
methods
that
differ
we
use
the
latest
in
scientific
technology
and
stateoftheart
weaponry
and
you
if
i
understand
correctly
poke
them
with
a
sharp
stick
well
it's
more
effective
than
it
sounds
oh
i'm
heh
quite
sure
of
that
as
i'm
just
as
sure
that
we
can
learn
much
from
each
other
i'm
working
on
getting
you
clearance
to
come
into
the
initiative
i
think
you'll
find
the
results
of
our
operation
most
impressive
agent
finn
here
alone
has
killed
or
captured
how
many
is
it
riley
note
of
pride
seventeen
eleven
vampires
six
demons
oh
wow
buffy
trying
to
sound
impressed
i
mean
that's
seventeen
what
about
you
me
how
many
hostiles
would
you
say
you've
slain
glancing
back
and
forth
between
them
buffy
is
considering
and
from
her
expression
we
know
it's
more
than
17
cut
to
giles's
apartment
he's
dusting
inside
one
of
his
book
cases

stops
as
he
suddenly
remembers
something
he
holds
the
feather
duster
between
his
teeth
and
takes
an
old
tome
from
the
shelf
he
opens
it
and
sits
down
on
a
cushion
footrest
he
reads
then
does
a
calculation
with
his
fingers
he
removes

moments
later
giles
is
at
his
work
desk
gathering
supplies
and
putting
them
in

daylight
buffy
and
riley
are
walking
outside
approaching
a
large
flowing
fountain
riley
has
a
stunned
expression
on
his
face
wow
those
are
my
best
stories
and
i
didn't
tell
you
the
buffy
breaks
her
butt
stories
but
you've
killed
a
you
did
the
thing
with
that
uh
you
drowned
and

the
daily
slayage
of
riley
pause
wow
it's
no
big
really
buffy
cheerfully
hey
who
wants
ice
cream
buffy
when
i
saw
you
stop
the
world
from
you
know
ending
i
just
assumed
that
was
a
big
week
for
you
turns
out
i
suddenly
find
myself
needing
to
know
the
plural
of
apocalypse
they've
rounded
the
fountain
and
continue
walking
look
if
you've
been
fighting
since
you
were
fifteen
you'd
have
a
hefty
resume'
too
riley
shocked
fifteen
buffy
winces
i
know
wow
the
point
is
that
that
we
have
different
amounts
of
experience
you
know
and
plus
i
do
have
that
whole
preternatural
slayer
strength
deal
riley
nodding
i've
seen
don't
get
me
wrong
the
girls
i
grew
up
with
could
hold
their
own
but
i'm
not
even
sure
i
could
take
you
buffy
stops
and
looks
up
at
him
that
all
depends
on
your
meaning
riley
smiles
down
at
her
cut
to
professor
walsh's
office
she
is
standing
behind
her
desk
busy
looking
over
some
papers
there
is
a
knock
on
the
door
yeah
the
door
opens
and
giles
steps
inside
professor
walsh
i
presume
you're
hard
to
find
thesethese
halls
are
quite
the
labyrinth
i
felt
like
theseus
and
the
minotaur
in
the
labyrinth
walsh
a
beat
can
i
help
you
with
something
mr

giles
rupert
giles
walks
over
and
offers
his
hand
walsh
shakes
it
i'm
looking
for
buffy
summers
i'm
uh
a
friend
of
hers
and
i
was
her
high
school
librarian
i'm
sorry
buffy's
not
here
but
if
i
see
her

giles
is
looking
at
walsh's
framed
credentials
hanging
on
the
wall
buffy's
been
very
influenced
by
your
cause
she
quotes
you
quite
often
giles
smiles
sometimes
she
sounds
like
an
introductory
textbook
herself
walsh
walks
past
him
to
put
something
in
the
file
cabinet
next
to
him
walsh
returning
to
her
desk
i
don't
lecture
from
the
text
book
but
i'm
glad
she's
inspired
by
the
material
she's
bright
all
she's
really
been
lacking
is
encouragement
in
the
academic
sect
oh
uh
i
think
it's
best
ifif
if
we
let
a
young
person
find
their
own
strengths
if
you
lead
a
child
by
the
hand
then
they'll
never
find
their
own
footing
and
if
it's
true
about
hiking
ergo
it
must
be
true
about
life
giles
removing
his
glasses
to
polish
them
with
a
handkerchief
that's
not
uh
i'm
just
saying
buffy
is
uh
well
she's
not
the
typical
student
once
you
get
to
know
her
she's
a
very
unique
girl
i
hope
you're
not
going
to
push
her
i
think
i
do
know
her
and
i
have
found
her
to
be
a
unique
woman
walsh
rounds
to
the
front
of
her
desk
to
sit
in
a
chair
facing
him
woman
of
course
how
wrong
of
me
to
choose
my
own
words
she's
very
selfreliant
very
independent
exactly
which
is
not
always
a
good
thing
walsh
this
causes
giles
to
pause
i
think
it
can
be
unhealthy
to
take
on
adult
roles
too
early
what
i
suspect
i'm
seeing
is
a
reaction
to
the
absence
of
a
male
role
model
giles
squinting
absence
walsh
standing
buffy
clearly
lacks
a
strong
father
figure
giles
is
speechless
walsh
decides
to
end
the
conversation
i'm
sorry
i
have
things
to
do
i'll
tell
buffy
her
friend
was
looking
for
her
walsh
moves
back
behind
her
desk
to
continue
working
and
off
giles'
slighted
expression
we
cut
to
a
cemetery
at
night
xander
and
willow
are
at
giles'
sides
they
are
walking
in
a
quick
pace
to
keep
up
with
him
this
princedemon
guy
was
supposed
to
rise
at
sunset
so
aren't
we
like
late
of
course
if
i
hadn't
had
to
search
the
globe
for
our
miss
summers
and
do
battle
with
that
harridan

and
if
you
hadn't
gotten
lost
on
campus
afterwards

never
mind
i'll
just
have
to
take
care
of
it
myself
i've
vanquished
a
few
demons
in
my
day
without
her
of
course
it
wouldn't
surprise
me
if
we're
entirely
too
late
demon
on
the
loose
carnage
everywhere
they've
reached
a
large
mausoleum
and
step
inside
through
the
wrought
iron
gate
cut
to
interior
shot
of
them
opening
the
inner
door
walking
down
the
foyer
steps
they
see
the
place
is
in
order
except
for
a
lot
of
cobwebs
decorating
the
walls
your
better
demons
will
clean
up
after
themselves
giles
confused
i
don't
understand
giles
moves
to
the
center
of
the
chamber
scanning
with
his
flashlight
umm
there
should
be
ruptured
earth
andand
broken
stone
oh
well
apparently
it
hasn't
happened
yet
a
bit
of
luck
giles
sets
his
bag
down
on
the
floor
and
opens
it
to
begin
pulling
out
his
supplies
or
you
know
what
i
bet
ii
bet
the
initiative
took
care
of
it
who
oh
riley
and
his

behind

booth
as

their
draft
beers
ethan
is
removing

down
again
something
happening
in
the
darkworlds
it's
always
been
rumors
out
there
but
only
one
thing's
coming
through
clear
that
something's
harming
demons
and
it's
not
the
slayer
know
anything
about
it
giles
takes
a
drink
what
are
they
saying
heh
you
know
demons
it's
all
exaggeration
and
blank
verse
pain
as
bright
as
steel
things
like
that
they're
scared
there's
something
called
314
that's
got
them
scared
most
of
all
the
kind
of
scared
that
turns
to
angry
i
know
we're
not
particularly
fond
of
each
other
ethan
giles
chuckles
scoffingly
rupert
but
we
are
a
couple
of
old
mystics
this
knew
outfit
it's
blundering
into
new
places
it
doesn't
belong
it's
throwing
the
worlds
out
of
balance
and
that's
way
beyond
chaos
mate
we're
headed
quite
literally
for
one
hell
of
a
fight
cut
to
close
up
of
buffy
throwing
jabs
at
the
camera
high
shot
we
see
she
is
sparring
with
riley
on
workout
mats
circling
each
other
he's
dressed
in
sweats
and
a
tshirt
buffy's
in
a
white
long
sleeve
shirt
and
blue
jeans
with
a
scarf
wrapped
over
her
long
flowing
hair
she
throws
a
few
more
jabs
and
he
blocks
them
and
counters
with
a
onetwo
combo
buffy
easily
ducks
under
they
continue
to
circle
buffy
launches
three
roundkicks
in
quick
succession
he
blocks
the
first
two
then
sidesteps
the
third
gets
up
behind
her
and
wrapping
his
arms
around
her
riley
smiling
are
you
pulling
back
buffy
grinning
are
you
riley
shrugs
maybe
a
little
buffy
suddenly
spins
out
of
the
hold
and
riley
is
thrown
off
his
feet
spinning
before
hitting
the
mat
on
his
back
he
looks
up
buffy
is
smiling
down
at
him
maybe
a
little
too
riley
smiles
and
kicks
himself
to
his
feet
they
begin
to
circle
again
i'll
go
all
out
if
you
will
are
you
sure
riley
serious
here
we
go
riley
steps
in
with
a
combination
of
hard
swinging
hooks
that
buffy
is
quick
to
block
she
ducks
under
his
last
punch
and
captures
his
legs
in
a
scissor
hold
and
takes
him
down
with
her
riley
quickly
rolls
out
of
her
legs
and
scrambles
to
his
feet
buffy
is
quicker
and
is
waiting
for
him
she
hits
him
in
the
chest
with
a
side
kick
that
launches
him
into
the
air
he
flies
across
the
room
over
a
gymnastic
pommel
horse
and
lands
on
a
thick
fall
cushion
the
impact
upsets
another
large
cushion
leaning
against
the
wall
and
it
falls
on
top
of
him
cut
to
buffy
shocked
expression
at
what
she
did
riley
she
runs
over
to
him
and
tosses
the
cushion
off
of
him
are
you
hurt
riley
sits
up
hand
on
his
chest
he
looks
winded
definitely
humbled
i
uh
riley
groans
i
don't
think
so
i'm
so
sorry
ii
didn't
mean
to
uh
riley
sounds
unsure
it's
fine
i'm
good
riley
offers
a
slight
grin
and
buffy
seems
to
feel
better
cut
back
to
giles
and
ethan
everything
is
almost
the
same
except
that
their
table
is
cluttered
with
glasses
and
shot
glasses
mostly
empty
and
they
are
both
stinky
drunk
they
seem
on
the
verge
of
passing
out
giles
faltering
voice

twenty
years

round

a
piece
of
paper

ethan
toasting
himself
here's
to
me
the
world
has
past
us
by
someone
snuck
in
and
left
us
a
couple
of
hasbeens
in
our
place
this
initiative
i
mean
their
methods
may
be
causing
problems
but
they're
getting
the
job
done
where
am
i
i'm
an
unemployed
librarian
with
a
tendency
to
get
knocked
on
the
head
well
we
won't
have
to
worry
about
that
anymore
now
mate
ethan
serious
tone
when
you
went
to
the
loo
i
slipped
a
small
pellet
of
poison
in
your
drink
you'll
be
dead
in
an
hour
dramatic
pause
as
the
words
sink
in
for
giles
and
he
seems
to
sober
just
kidding
they
both
burst
out
laughing
blood
alcohol
returning
to
their
high
intoxicated
levels
giles
calming
down
i'm
gonna
feel
like
hell
in
the
morning
relax
enjoy
the
night
we're
just
a
couple
of
sorcerers
the
night
is
still
our
time
time
of
magic
they
raise
their
glasses
in
a
toast
to
magic
cut
to
tara's
dorm
room
dorm
unknown
room
number
unknown
it
is
very
dim
the
walls
are
black
and
strewn
with
a
string
of
white
christmas
lights
that
give
the
place
a
mystical
look
tara
is
kneeling
on
the
floor
pouring
white
powder
sand
or
salt
in
the
design
of
a
fourpoint
star
in
a
circle
willow
is
holding
a
red
rose
willow
sitting
across
from
her
i'm
glad
you
wanted
to
get
together
i
know
it's
late
thanks
tara
a
beat
i
was
happy
you
called
willow
places
the
rose
on
top
of
the
circled
star
we'll
start
out
slow
tara
sits
and
willow
reaches
her
hands
out
to
her
and
the
blonde
girl
links
hands
with
her
okay
willow
closes
her
eyes
and
tara
follows
suit
they
sit
there
for
a
few
seconds
in
silence
willow
yeah
tara
eyes
opening
start
out
slow
doing
what
willow
opens
her
eyes
willow
in
a
soft
voice
oh
we're
gonna
float
the
rose
then
use
the
majiks
to
pluck
the
petals
off
one
at
a
time
it's
a
test
of
synchronicity
our
minds
have
to
be
perfectly
attuned
to
work
as
a
single
delicate
implement
tara
a
moment
then
smiles
cool
and
it
should
be
very
pretty
they
hold
hands
again
and
close
their
eyes
they
are
in
deep
concentration
and
a
bright
light
comes
to
life
on
the
circled
star
at
the
same
time
a
soft
breeze
sweeps
through
the
room
and
the
rose
starts
to
shudder
slowing
it
begins
to
rise
when
it
is
shoulder
level
with
the
girls
they
open
their
eyes
and
look
at
it
they
release
each
other's
hands
tara
softly
it
worked
willow
softly
now
for
the
hard
part
the
petals
they
begin
to
concentrate
again
looking
at
the
rose
when
the
rose
suddenly
shoots
off
across
the
room
surprised
they
stand
and
watch
as
the
rose
ricochets
off
the
walls
a
few
times
and
have
to
duck
to
avoid
it
it
finally
comes
straight
down
on
the
four
point
star
and
we
see
that
it
is
petalless
but
smoking
willow
shocked
what
the
heck
was
that
i
don't
know
but
uh
the
petals
are
off
tara
chuckling
cut
to
exterior
shot
of
giles'
apartment
building
morning
giles'
citroen
is
parked
by
the
curb
cut
to
interior
shot
giles'
loft
an
alarm
buzzer
goes
off
and
we
see
a
body
moving
under
a
sheet
on
the
bed
and
the
alarm
is
shut
off
dissolve
to
shot
of
panted
legs
walking
down
the
stairs
giles
yawning
i
feel
like
hell
in
the
morning
we
see
giles
reach
the
landing
and
stop
in
front
of
a
small
mirror
hanging
on
the
wall
while
he
releases
a
big
yawn
stretching
his
arms
we
see
that
giles
is
a
demon
light
brownish
tan
skin
with
long
horns
sprouting
from
the
sides
of
his
forehead
curving
back
and
around
his
really
long
hairy
ears
ending
in
sharp
points
next
to
his
cheeks
as
he
yawns
he
shows
us
a
set
a
fangs
much
like
a
vampire's
he
smacks
his
lips
when
the
yawn
is
done
and
finally
opens
his
sleepy
eyes
and
sees
his
new
form
for
the
first
time
giles
eyes
popping
wide
open
uh
wha
wha
giles
touching
his
horns
no
leaning
closer
to
the
mirror
he
puts
a
hand
on
the
wall
and
his
now
clawed
hand
goes
through
it
giles
is
in
a
state
of
disbelief
as
he
pulls
his
hand
back
out
and
absently
rests
it
on
the
stairs'
banister
it's
instantly
rip
from
the
railing
he
looks
at
what
he
did
damn
he
takes
the
final
steps
down
to
the
first
floor
and
throws
the
banister
down
where
it
hits
a
chair
and
shatters
it
he's
looking
around
confused
then
is
struck
by
a
thought
ethan
giles'
voice
has
taken
on
a
low
gravelly
sound
he
goes
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
it
shatters
in
his
hand
before
he
can
lift
it
to
his
ear
he
drops
it
and
moves
to
pick
up
his
shirt
from
the
floor
he
struggles
to
get
into
the
sleeves
and
when
he
tries
to
shrug
into
it
his
now
jutting
ridged
spine
rips
it
down
the
middle
giles
grimacing
oh
and
i
liked
that
shirt
he
trades
the
shredded
shirt
for
a
thick
flannel
blanket
and
wraps
it
around
his
shoulders
as
he
heads
for
the
door
he
grabs
the
handle
and
the
door
comes
off
its
hinges
but
giles
is
beyond
caring
at
this
point
and
steps
outside
cut
to
buffy
she
and
willow
are
having
breakfast
in
the
rocket
cafe
on
campus
we
haven't
seen
buffy
in
this
good
a
mood
in
such
a
long
time
it's
almost
scary
she
is
happily
stacking
her
pancakes
on
her
plate
i
like
pancakes
'cause
they're
stackable
buffy
looks
at
willow's
plate
ooo
and
waffles
'cause
you
can
put
things
in
the
little
holes
if
you
wanted
to
willow
laughing
you
should
always
have
a
new
boyfriend
you're
so
much
fun
right
now
hey
i
didn't
hear
you
come
in
last
night
where
were
you
willow
quickly
the
chem
lab
by
myself
willow
a
beat
ii
was
trying
this
new
spell
floating
a
rose
when
all
of
a
sudden
willow
motions
with
fork
zing
zing
zing
like
all
over
the
room
it
was
like
a
rosebased
missile
yikes
i
know
i
think
there's
something
out
there
ii
felt
this
presence
this
dark
majiks
energy
blocking
the
spell
it's
new
someone
else
doing
majiks
maybe
if
so
it's
someone
pretty
powerful
hmm
i'll
tell
giles
about
it
or
maybe
i'll
tell
maggie
she
seemed
kind
of
interested
in
learning
the
mystical
side
of
the
whole
demon
hunting
biz
tell
giles
he's
feeling
a
little
hurt
right
now
willow
buffy
frowns
in
question
how
come
you
never
told
him
about
riley
being
a
commando
i
did
buffy
willow
shakes
her
head
i
didn't
he
says
no
he's
feeling
neglected
and
outoftheloopy
well
i
didn't
at
first
because
riley
said
not
to
and
and
then
meow
cat
out
of
the
bag
and
ii
guess
i
just
forgot
that
he
didn't
know
buffy
cheerfully
i'll
make
it
up
to
him
when
i
see
him
tomorrow
i'm
spending
today
with
riley
oh
yeah
i
forgot
that's
what
you
always
do
on
the
days
when
the
earth
rotates
buffy
smiling
it's
just
going
so
well
right
now
i
think
buffy
stops
smiling
i
hope
buffy
grins
sheepishly
i
sort
of
kicked

noise
outside

a
soul

have
a
conscience
i
am
a
human
being
oh
stop
the
car
the
citroen
pulls
to
a
stop
at
the
corner
of
main
street
and
we
see
that
professor
walsh
has
just
crossed
the
street
giles
hops
out
of
the
car
without
his
blanket
and
creeps
up
behind
her
when
he's
close
enough
he
roars
and
waves
his
claws
in
the
air
walsh
looks
over
her
shoulder
and
surprising
for
the
evil
bitch
monster
of
death
screams
like
a
woman
and
runs
for
her
life
as
giles
chases
her
down
the
street
pass
the
espresso
pump
he
stops
halfway
down
the
street
but
walsh
continues
to
flee
giles
hurries
back
to
the
car
ignoring
the
gaping
stares
of
a
few
pedestrians
giles
closing
the
door
right
let's
go
then
while
we're
still
laughing
our
asses
off
we
go
back
to
giles's
apartment
our
gang
is
gathered
around
the
sofa
xander
willow
and
anya
are
sitting
on
the
cushions
and
buffy

sitting
on
the

of
the

really
long
couch
and
riley
is
standing
behind
it
xander
points
into
the
book
he's
holding

passes
it
to

that's
the

a
reason

it
doesn't
sound
like
these
fyarl
demons

really
big
independent
thinkers

will
the
spells
that

be
caused
by
someone
using
majiks
to
control
a
demon
making
this

he
rolls
towards
the
sidewalk
as
the
car
continues
and
is
on
his
feet
and
heading
for
the
shadows
by
the
time
the
humvees
come
tearing
after
spike
cut
to
exterior
shot
of
sunnydale
motor
inn
which
looks
like
the
same
motel
faith
stayed
at
cut
to
interior
of
ethan's
room
he
is
busy
packing
his
suitcase
to
haul
ass
out
of
town
when
giles
smashes
through
the
door
almost
shitting
a
brick
ethan
turns
and
is
frightened
by
the
site
of
the
pissed
off
demon
growling
at
him
then
recognition
hits
giles
ethan
sees
that
giles
is
deep
in
like
to
crush
mode
and
backs
away
at
his
approach
now
itit
calm
down
ethan
gets
on
the
bed
trying
to
escape
it's
okay
good
giles
giles
reaches
for
him
and
ethan
dodges
him
jumping
off
the
bed
it
seems
like
he
might
make
it
past
him
when
giles
grabs
him
no
no
don't
kill
me
practically
a
mindless
fyarl
demon
now
giles
gets
him
by
the
throat
and
lifts
him
in
the
air
ethan
choking
i
can't
undo
you
if
you
kill
me
but
giles
doesn't
seem
to
care
and
flings
him
across
the
room
where
he
crashes
headfirst
into
a
night
stand
shattering
it
to
pieces
that's
when
buffy
and
riley
rush
in
and
see
the
situation
ethan
to
buffy
you've
got
to
stop
it
it
killed
ripper
and
now
it's
trying
to
get
me
buffy
glaring
at
giles
but
to
riley
don't
let
him
go
giles
takes
a
step
forward
and
buffy
knocks
him
back
against
the
wall
with
a
spinning
back
kick
buffy
very
pissed
what
did
you
do
to
him
what
did
you
do
the
humvee
chase
is
still
in
progress
spike
is
definitely
enjoying
himself
as
he
pulls
the
wheel
sharply
to
the
side
making
the
decrepit
citroen
fishtail
around
a
corner
the
humvees
are
still
on
its
ass
spike
takes
another
sharp
turn
and
this
time
the
lead
humvee
looses
control
and
spins
out
forcing
the
second
humvee
to
screech
to
a
halt
before
it
hits
it
spike
looking
in
rearview
mirror
you
just
try
and
stop
me

into
the
side
of
a
building
back
to

and
shoves
her
against

wall

retaliates
with
a
hard
right
cross

trying
to
escape
hits
riley
with
a
right
cross
riley
showing
considerable
restraint
just
grabs
him
and
throws
him
against
the
dresser
twisting
his
arm
behind
his
back
buffy
is
executing
a
jumping
front
kick
knocking
giles
back
ethan
watching
you're
only
going
to
make
him
angry
which
seems
true
as
giles
just
keeps
getting
back
up
no
matter
how
many
times
buffy
knocks
him
down
ethan
tries
to
escape
again
elbowing
riley
in
the
face
but
riley
grabs
him
again
slamming
him
into
the
wall
before
he
could
reach
the
door
giles
takes
a
swing
at
buffy
who
ducks
and
slams
several
punches
to
his
face
when
ethan
takes
another
swing
at
him
riley
takes
a
few
seconds
to
beat
the
crap
out
of
him
he
smashes
an
elbow
into
ethan's
face
and
punches
him
in
the
stomach

in
the
face
with
a
roundkick
and
riley
shoulderflips
ethan
to
the
floor
getting
him
in
an
arm
lock
and
pressing
a
knee
against
his
face
back
to
buffy
and
giles
she
is
picking
up
a
foldable
stand
as
giles
charges
her
with
his
large
horns
and
traps
his
head
in
the
leather
straps
swinging
him
around
she
throws
him
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
she
tries
to
press
her
attack
when
giles
frees
himself
lifting
his
head
smashing
the
curve
of
his
horn
into
her
face
and
she
falls
to
the
floor
giles
growls
at
her
buffy
gets
giles'
legs
in
a
scissor
lock
and
takes
him
down
before
he
can
get
up
buffy
straddles
his
waist
with
the
letter
opener
in
her
hand
she
leans
down
close
to
him
this
is
for
giles
for
me
with
both
hands
buffy
raises
the
weapon
high
above
her
head
and
slams
it
down
into
giles'
chest
giles'
eyes
open
wide
buffy
is
looking
into
his
eyes
buffy
shocked
oh

buffy
pulls
out
the
letter
opener
in
buffy's
pov
giles
is
trying
to
say
something
in
fyarl
buffy
pleading
oh

giles

soi'm
so
sorry

die
actually
i

quite
well
except
for
the
rage
buffy
sees
that
giles
doesn't
seem
to
be
dying
and
is
relieved
buffy
to
riley
i
think
he's
okay
i
buffy
frowning
at
letter
opener
is
this
thing
real
silver
cut
to
some
time
later
riley
is
guarding
the
door
speaking
into
his
cell
phone
ethan
is
sitting
crosslegged
on
the
floor
remnants
of
a
spell
just
completed
in
front
of
him
buffy
is
standing
behind
him
holding
him
by
the
back
of
his
collar
he's
looking
glum
as
he
rests
his
chin
on
his
fist
ethan
pouting
i
really
got
to
learn
to
just
do
the
damage
and
get
out
of
town
it's
the
stay
and
gloat
that
gets
me
every
time
buffy
nudges
him
with
her
knee
and
walks
across
the
room
as
riley
finishes
his
call
we
see
giles
normal
again
except
for
a
very
ugly
silk
shirt
he's
wearing
standing
in
front
of
the
dresser
mirror
looking
at
himself
buffy
stands
beside
him

at

the

day

on
the
sofa
legs
curled
barefoot
with
a
throw
pillow
in

the
handpiece
through
this
ingenious
speaking
tube

towards
the
couch
removing
his
glasses
buffy
i

butface
buffy
giles
narrows
his
eyebrows
at
her
you
look
like
you're
gonna
say
but
giles
a
beat
but
this
um
initiative
i'mi'm
a
little
concerned
ethan's
not
exactly
a
reliable
source
but
um
i'm
not
sure
that
he's
wrong
about
them
rounds
the
sofa
to
sit
down
next
to
her
i'm
not
dating
the
initiative
i'm
dating
riley
he's
a
good
guy
and
ii
believe
that
but
he's
part
of
something
wewe
don't
really
understand
buffy
knowingly
you
sure
you're
not
just
saying
this
because
you
don't
like
riley's
boss
giles
as
if
offended
no
no
i'm
not
saying
that
at
all
giles
considers
though
i
do
hate
her
quite
a
lot
but
i
want
you
to
have
your
personal
life
but
keep
your
eyes
open
make
sure
you
know
what
you're
getting
into
cut
to
the
underground
headquarters
of
the
initiative
riley
is
walking
with
walsh
across
the
large
complex
in
the
background
we
can
see
several
lab
techs
and
military
personnel
moving
about
as
well
as
the
two
parked
humvees
that
were
unable
to
catch
an
old
grampa
car
so
she
walks
in
and
the
rules
just
suddenly
break
umm
pretty
much
be
careful
with
her
she
reacts
on
instinct
there's
no
discipline
there
her
loyalties
are
uncertain
they
reach
a
metal
security
door
you
won't
be
disappointed
in
her
she's
good
at
what
she
does
she
is
the
truest
soul
i've
ever
known
oh
no
walsh
chuckling
oh
no
spontaneous
poetic
exclamations
lord
spare
me
college
boys
in
love
i'm
just
saying
she'll
work
out
you'll
be
proud
of
her
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
walsh
pause
i
think
you're
probably
right
riley
smiles
then
moves
off
leaving
walsh
who
swipes
an
id
card
through
a
keypad
and
steps
inside
the
security
door
cut
to
interior
we
see
walsh
walk
a
short
distance
down
a
white
corridor
and
punch
a
code
into
another
keypad
and
slide
the
id
card
through
again
the
door
she
is
standing
in
front
of
unlocks
and
she
opens
it
and
disappears
inside
it
closes
again
and
we
see
a
number
stenciled
into
the
door
