what
robin
just
shakes
his
head
zoom
in
on
a
stake
in
robin's
closed
fist—he's
squeezing
it
so
tight
that
blood
is
oozing
out
between
his
fingers
robin
glaring
at
spike
mumbling
under
his
breath
just
waiting
for
my
moment

through
the
levelor
blinds
watching
the
students
in
the
hallway
his
hand
is
bandaged
buffy
walks
up
to
his
door
situation
still
normal
buffy
shrugs
well
or
as
normal
as
this
school
ever
sees
robin
lets
go
of
the
blinds
so
it
appears
robin
turns
buffy
puts
her
purse
down
well
no
fires
no
one's
head's
going
kablooey
and
the
swing
choir
and
the
marching
band
have
gone
back
to
their
normal
healthy
seething
resentment
robin
smiles
yeah
it's
been
pretty
quiet
around
here
since
you
shut
down
that
seal
robin
walks
up
to
buffy
you
just
may
have
stopped
this
thing
buffy
no
it
can't
be
that
easy
you
call
that
easy
hey
any
apocalypse
i
avert
without
dying
yeah
those
are
the
easy
ones
robin
looks
down
you
know
you're
uhyou're
something
else
miss
summers
robin
looks
at
buffy
you
know
i've
been
watching
you
when
you're
out
patrolling
and
you
um—
you
remind
me
of
my
um
your
mother
yeah
yeah
what
i
remember
of
her
anyway
got
to
tell
you
not
a
line
every
girl
likes
to
hear
but—in
this
case—
buffy
smiles
compliment
taken
maybe
you're
right
maybe
everything
is
fine
giles
walks
up
to
buffy
everything's
terrible
total
catastrophe
giles
what's
wrong
have
you
seen
the
new
library
there's
nothing
but
computers
there's
not
a
book
to
be
seen
i—i
don't
know
where
to
begin
buffy
i
mean
who
do
we
speak
to
uh
that
would—that
would
be
me
robin
offers
his
hand
to
giles
hi
i'm
robin
wood
oh
sorry
giles
shakes
robin's
hand
rupert
giles
sorry
buffy
tells
me
you're
something
of
a
freelance
demon
fighter
giles
robin
points
to
his
office
door
then
closes
it
oh
yes
yes
i
um
i'm
relieved
we're
running
dangerously
low
on
allies
so
we
didn't
stop
it
then
robin
sits
behind
his
desk
buffy
sits
on
it
giles
leans
forward
on
robin's
desk
uh
no
the
seers
at
the
coven
are
certain
the
first
is
continuing
to
gather
its
forces
i'm
afraid
war
is
inevitable
giles
stands
so
we
should
go
before
the
school
board
robin
confused
what
well
i
can
have
my
backup
library
giles
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
sent
from
home
in
the
mean
time
it's
not
much
but—
giles
knowledge
comes
from
crafted
bindings
and
pages
buffy
not
ones
and
zeros
so
did
you
bring
back
any
potentials
um
no
actually
mmy
uh
giles
takes
off
glasses
to
clean
them
my
trip
is
about
something
elseregarding
spike
spike
what
about
him
i
told
you
my
concerns
when
you
recklessly
chose
giles
puts
glasses
on
to
remove
the
chip
from
his
head
wait
sorry
chip
uh
it's
a
long
story
the
military
put
a
chip
in
spike's
head
so
he
couldn't
hurt
anyone
and
that
would
be
the
abridged
version
but
he
wouldn't
hurt
anyone
anymore
because
he
has
a
soul
now
unless
the
first
triggers
him
again
triggers
the
chip
no
the
trigger's
a
posthypnotic
thing
the
first
put
it
in
his
head
it
was—made
him—
he
was
killing
again
so
he
has
a
trigger
a
soul
and
a
chip
not
anymore
buffy
angrily
it
was
killing
him
giles
the
trigger
no
the
chip
the
trigger's
not
active
anymore
because
the
military
gave
him
a
soul
robin
buffy
and
giles
glare
at
robin
who
throws
up
his
hands
sorry
we
don't
know
that
the
trigger
is
inactive
giles
walks
over
to
the
window
what
i
brought
back
may
help
us
to
disarm
it
to
ascertain
exactly
what
it
is
that
causes
spike's
behavior
it
was
that
song
giles
i'm
telling
you
it
was
that
song
that
spike
was
singing
he
has
no
memory
of
it
is
there
any
part
of
it
that
you
can
remember
it
wasn't
like
it
had
a
catchy
hook
or
anything
like
i'm
coming
up
so
you
better
get
this
party
started
it
was
boring
old
and
english
just
like
you—ull
yule
brenner
buffy
giles
crosses
his
arms
and
glares
at
buffy
a
british
yule
brenner
robin
to
giles
this
thing
you
brought
to
keep
spike
from
killing
again
how's
it
work
well
it
will
require
a
bit
of
magic
cut
to
11
int
basement
at
buffy's
house
day
xander
is
fastening
shackles
around
spike's
wrists
xander
mumbling
no
we
couldn't
have
put
these
chains
back
up
a
week
ago
nah
we
gotta
work
on
spike
now
of
all
times
what
xander
sighs
stands
looks
around
nothing
xander
walks
away
pan
around
the
room
to
show
everyone's
there
dawn
buffy
giles
robin
xander
they're
all
staring
at
spike
who's
chained
to
the
wall
sitting
on
his
cot
spike
to
robin
what
are
you
doing
here
you
came
to
see
the
show
i
thought
you
might
need
support
uhhuh
right
let's
get
this
over
with
spike
to
giles
what're
you
gonna
do
some
hypnobeam
a
disarming
spell
giles
walks
up
to
spike
but
keeps
his
distance
not
exactly
the
first
has
brainwashed
you
there's
something
in
your
subconscious
that
it's
using
to
provoke
a
violent
reaction
so
giles
takes
a
small
box
out
of
his
pocket
and
takes
a
small
rock
out
of
the
box
we
have
to
put
this
in
your
brain
bugger
that
buffy's
eyes
grow
wide
with
concern
when
she
sees
the
stone
but
she
remains
quiet
standing
there
with
her
arms
crossed
the
prokaryote
stone
will
move
within
your
mind
to
reveal
the
root
of
the
trigger's
power
can
unleash
ideas
images
memories
hopefully
once
you
understand
what
it
is
that's
giles
rolls
his
eyes
setting
you
off
you
can
break
its
hold
on
you
hopefully
so
it
might
not
work
the
stone's
just
a
catalyst
for
the
process
the
rest
is
up
to
spike
and
how
do
expect
to
get
that
hunk
of
rubble
into
my
cranium
willow
giles
puts
the
stone
in
the
box
and
holds
it
out
toward
willow
willow

carrying
a

willow

the

it's
alive
no
longer
solid
but
liquid
giles
leans
back
away
from
the
stone
and
holds
the
box
up
to

spike
recoiling
oh
you
have
got
to
be
joking
what
now
it
has
to
access
the
cerebral
cortex
via
the
optic
nerve
oh
bollocks
with
all
the
rubbish
people
keep
sticking
in
my
head
it's
a
wonder
that
there's
room
for
my
brain
giles
rolls
his
eyes
i
don't
think
it
takes
up
that
much
space
do
you
giles
holds
the
box
up
to
spike's
face
the
liquid
stone
crawls
out
of
the
box
onto
spike's
cheek
then
shimmies
up
into
his
eye
sliding
under
his
eyelid
spike
starts
to
squirm
ow
oh
ow
buffy
runs
to
his
side
spike
spike
listen
to
me
yeah
are
you
all
right
how
am
i
supposed
to
know
if
this
bugugly's
doing
its

an
orange
light
distracts
spike
and
he
looks
into
a
far
off
place
cut

parlor
day
spike's
looking
off
into
another
world
a
man
is
standing
reading
to
an

woman
who
sits
on
a
chair
in
front
of
him
needle
pointing
the
room's
decorated
with
lots
of
knickknacks
around
the
walls
are
covered
with
paintings
and
there's
a
cozy
fire
in
the
fireplace
zoom
in
on
the
man
to
show
it's
spike
when
he
was
alive
when
he
was
william
he's
reading
from
handwritten
pages
presenting
his
poetry
yet
her
smell
it
doth
linger
painting
pictures
in
my
mind
her
eyes
balls
of
honey
angel's
harps
her

oh

oh

magnificent
i
wonder
though
this
cecily
of

so
often
william
turns
oh
would
that
be
the
underwood's
eldest
girl
william
shrugs
looks
down
uh
no
uh
no
i
do
not
presume
she's
lovely
you
shouldn't
be
alone
you
need
a
woman
in
your
life
william
looks
at
the
woman
i
have
a
woman
in
my
life
but
you
ne—
mother
giggles
oh
mother
giggles
well
do
not
mistake
me
william
takes
off
his
reading
glasses
i
still
have
hopes
that
one
day
there
will
be
an
addition
to
this
household
but
i
will
always
look
after
you
mother
this
i
promise
the
woman
has
a
coughing
fit
and
covers
her
mouth
with
a
handkerchief
william
hands
her
a
glass
of
water
she
puts
down
the
hand
holding
her
handkerchief
when
she
drinks
the
water
held
with
her
other
hand
but
william
can
see
there's
blood
on
the
handkerchief
should
i
send
the
coach
for
doctor
gull
mother
shakes
her
head
i'll
be
all
right
it's
passed
just
sit
with
me
a
while
will
you
of
course
william
sits
on
the
floor
leaning
on
her
knee
as
she
goes
back
to
her
needle
pointing
and
sings
to
him
mother
singing
early
one
morning
just
as
the
sun
was
shining
i
heard
a
maid
sing
in
the
valley
below
oh
don't
deceive
me
oh
never
leave
me
how
could
you
use
a
poor
maiden
so
william
closes
his
eyes
and
listens
to
his
mother
sing
cut
to
13
int

at
buffy's
house
day
spike
opens
his
eyes
again
and
they
turn
yellow
as
he
vamps
out
in
a
rage
he
grabs
buffy's
neck
as
she
sits
beside
him
and
throws
her
across
the
room
into
the
washer
and
dryer
he
stands
growling
and
lunges
out
toward
the
others
standing
there
but
he's
restrained
by
the
chains
then
he
turns
to
the
cot
picks
it
up
and
throws
it
across
the
room
it
knocks
dawn
down
and
willow
runs

xander

and
robin
step
back
as

rages
in
their
direction
buffy
steps
forward
but
spike
throws
his
head
back
and
looks
like
he's
having
a
mild
seizure
the
stone
is
coming
out
of
his
eye
slithers
down
his
cheek
and
falls
to
the
floor
solid
again
spike's
back
to
human
face
looking
around
as
buffy
and
giles
stare
at
him
trying
to
determine
if
he's
still
dangerous

as
he
recovers
from

about

well

buffy
walks
toward

but
giles
stops
her
what
are
you
doing
i'm
going
to
unchain
him
buffy
just—
buffy
whispering
this
is
pointless
giles
he
doesn't
know
anything
your
prophylactic
stone
didn't
work
giles
whispering
because
he's
not
cooperating
this
process
takes
time
he's
blocking
whatever's
flooding
his
consciousness
and
what
he
does—he's
endangering
us
all
so
the
trigger's
still
working
much
as
ever
giles
turns
away
in
disgust
spike
fights
against
his
chains

looks
at

william
looks

let

do
this
for

what
are

william
hugs

house
day
willow
walks
down
the
stairs
to
the
basement
to
talk
to
buffy
buffy
hey
i
uh
just
got
a
phone
call
i'm
gonna
have
to
take
off
for
a
while
maybe
a
day
or
two
what's
wrong
nothing
you
need
to
worry
about
i'll
give
you
the
full
scoop
later
maybe
i'll
even
bring
back
some
good
news
could
use
a
little
of
that
ok
i
guess
now
is
as
good
a
time
as
we're
likely
to
see
for
a
while
just
hurry
back
will
do
willow
walks
upstairs
buffy
walks
toward
spike
think
about
what
you're
doing
i
have
buffy
unchains
spike
then
walks
toward
the
stairs
with
spike
following
her
buffy
buffy
continues
walking
without
stopping
don't
buffy
and
spike
walk
upstairs
giles
goes
to
follow
but
robin
stops
him
mr
giles
you
got
a
moment
what's
on
your
mind
the
same
thing
that's
on
yours
robin
looks
up
the
stairs
we
got
ourselves
a
problem
spike
giles
sighs
yeah
if
that
trigger's
still
working
then
the
first
must
be
waiting
for
just
the
right
time
to
use
it
against
us
it
does
seem
doubtful
the
first
simply
forgot
it
had
such
a
powerful
weapon
yeah
a
while
back
it
slipped
up
it
told
andrew
it
wasn't
time
yet
for
spike
so
whatever
the
first's
ultimate
plan
is
it's
obvious
that
spike
must
play
an
integral
part
in
that
something
needs
to
be
done
giles
shakes
his
head
buffy
would
never
allow
it
giles
walks
back
downstairs
to
talk
with
robin
buffy
would
listen
to
her
watcher
wouldn't
she
i
don't
think
you
have
much
of
an
idea
of
the
watcherslayer
dynamic
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
raised
by
a
watcher
you
were
bernard
crowley
took
me
in
when
i
was
a
young
kid
trained
me
crowley
i
remember
the
name
new
york
based
watcher
resigned
shortly
after
his
slayer
was—
giles
looks
at
robin
carefully
you're
nikki
wood's
son
robin
nods
yes
spike
killed
your
mother
robin
looks
away
yes
giles
looks
down
does
buffy
know
this
she
knows
my
mother
was
a
slayer
shedoesn't
know
about
spike
giles
shrugs
and
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
personal
vengeance
does
it
matter
he's
an
instrument
of
evil
now
he's
gonna
prove
to
be
our
undoing
in
this
fight
buffy's
undoing
and
she
will
never—never
see
it
coming
now
i'm
talking
about
what
needs
to
be
done
for
the
greater
good
giles
and
you
know
i'm
right
giles
sighs
what
exactly
do
you
propose
i
just
need
you
to
keep
buffy
away
for
a
few
hours
cut

19
ext

night
giles
and
buffy
are
walking
through
the

talking
i
don't
know
giles
is
this
really
a
primo
time
for
a
training
session
i'm
still
your
teacher
buffy
as
adept
as
you
are
as
a
slayer
there
are
always
new
things
to
learn
now
more
than
ever
it's
crucial
to
maintain
focus
on
your
calling
in
case
you
haven't
noticed
our
plates
are
kinda
full
right
now
plus
i'm
not
really
sure
how
i
feel
about
leaving
spike
at
robin's
house
to
watch
over
him
for
what
its
worth
everyone
at
your
house
seemedquite
relieved
at
the
arrangement
um
buffy
uhwhile
i'm
not
technically
your
watcher
anymore
the
fact
that
your
life
is
such
chaos
only
underscores
the
importance
of
the
lessons
i
can
impart
to
you
fine
impart
away
we're
on
the
verge
of
war
it's
time
you
looked
at
the
big
picture
hello
all
i
do
is
look
at
the
big
picture
the
other
day
i
gave
an
inspirational
speech
to
the
telephone
repair
man
it
takes
more
than
rousing
speeches
to
lead
buffy
if
you're
going
to
be
a
general
you
need
to
be
able
to
make
difficult
decisions
regardless
of
cost
have
you
seen
me
with
those
girls
buffy
paces
i
mean
the
way
i've
treated
my
friends
and
my
family
and
andrew
believe
me
i
know
how
to
make
hard
decisions
well
that's

robin
flips
on
the
lights
in
the
shed
to
reveal
that
every
square
inch
of
the

inside

hell
is

spike
beat
what's
your
story

of
man
are
you
spike
sorry

into

to
strap
on

paraphernalia
to
his

completely
oblivious
to
the
damage
he's
doing
to
everyone
around
him
that
right
oh

more
about
you

robin

to
continue
putting
on

remember
mine
she

i
wanna
kill
the
