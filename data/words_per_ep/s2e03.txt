stabbed
a
horticulture
teacher
with
a
trowel
i
didn't

snyder
buffy
looks
at
him
in
shock
thursday
is
parent
teacher
night
your
parents
assuming
you
have
any
will
meet
your
teachers
assuming
you
have
any
left
i've
decided
to
put
the
two
of
you
in
charge
of
this
event
you
have
three
days
to
prepare
the
refreshments
make
the
banners
and
transform
the
school
lounge
into
a
habitable
place
for
adults
this
will
incur
my
good
will
and
may
affect
what
i
tell
your
parents
when
i
meet
them
are
we
clear
i'm
clear
buffy
to
sheila
don't
you
feel
clear
buffy
sheila
just
looks
back
we're
very
clear
good
because
you
mess
up
this
time
and
your
parents
will
be
coming
to
clean
out
your
lockers
cut
to
the
school's
main
entrance
the
bell
rings
buffy
and
sheila
come
walking
out
of
the
building
well
it
shouldn't
be
that
hard
we
can
work
on
the
banners
at
lunch
tomorrow
and
figure
out
refreshments
then
yeah
sure
whatever
sheila
yells
hey
meat
pie
sheila
walks
off
xander
and
willow
meet
up
with
buffy
snyder's
got
you
guys
making
party
favors
huh
his
two
worst
students
that's
what
mom
sees
when
she
looks
at
me
a
sheila
sheila
kisses
an
older
boy
with
long
blonde
hair
well
sheila's
definitely
intense
that
guy
with
her
that's
the
guy
she
can
bring
home
to
mother
she
was
already
smoking
in
fifth
grade
once
i
was
lookout
for
her
xander
to
willow
you're
bad
to
the
bone
i'm
a
rebel
it's
not
fair
i'm
the
slayer
that
requires
a
certain
amount
of
cutting
and
fighting
what's
sheila's
excuse
homework
she
won't
do
it
and
most
teachers
respect
that
now
oh
you
might
wanna
keep
away
any
sharp
implements
when
you're
working
with
her
do
you
think
any
other
slayers
ever
had
to
go
to
high
school
it's
no
biggie
you'll
have
a
nice
soiree
the
parents
will
love
it
as
long
as
nothing
really
bad
happens
between
now
and
then
you'll
be
fine
are
you
crazy
what
did
you
say
that
for
now
something
bad
is
gonna
happen
whadaya
mean
nothing's
gonna
happen
not
until
some
dummy
says
'as
long
as
nothing
bad
happens'
buffy
it's
the
ultimate
jinx
what
were
you
thinking
or
were
you
even
thinking
at
all
the
girls
give
xander
looks
of
exasperation
and
walk
off
well
you
guys
don't
know
xander
hugs
his
satchel
maybe
this
time
it'll
be
different
cut
to
a
small
park
and
playground
that
night
a
classic
1958
dodge
desoto
fireflite
crashes
through
the
'welcome
to
sunnydale'
sign
and
screeches
to
a
halt
spike
gets
out
and
strolls
over
to
the
curb
he
takes
a
deep
breath
and
lights
a
cigarette
home
sweet
home
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

inside
collin's
warehouse
the
master
is
dead
someone
has
to
take
his
place
as
long
as
the
slayer's
alive
whoever
takes
his
place
will
be
sharing
his
grave
then
let
the
soul
who
kills
her
wear
his
mantle
can
you
do
it
yes
this
weekend
the
night
of
st
vigeous
our
power
shall
be
at
its
peak
when
i
kill
her
it'll
be
the
greatest
event
since
the
crucifixion
and
i
should
know
i
was
there
spike
appears
behind
them
you
were
there
spike
chuckles
oh
please
if
every
vampire
who
said
he
was
at
the
crucifixion
was
actually
there
it
would
have
been
like
woodstock
i
oughta
rip
your
throat
out
spike
turns
his
back
to
him
and
strolls
away
i
was
actually
at
woodstock
that
was
a
weird
gig
i
fed
off
a
flower
person
and
i
spent
the
next
six
hours
watchin'
my
hand
move
vampire1
rushes
him
from
behind
and
spike
swings
his
fist
up
without
even
looking
hitting
him
in
the
face
and
knocking
him
down
and
out
so
who
do
you

yoyo
and
sets

aside
he
pulls
out
a

finds
a
stake
and
rushes
back
out

to
the
alley
buffy
punches
the

face
again
and
then
his
chest

gets
loose
from

and
lands
a
punch
on
her
face

goes
spinning
down
to
the
ground
and

there
momentarily
stunned
the
vampire
looms
over
her

turns
to
him
and
he
throws
her
the
stake

catches
it
out
of
the
air
and
in
a
smooth
swift
motion
plunges
it
home
into
the
vampire's
chest

doesn't
even
have
time
to
fall
before
he
crumbles
to

ahead
of
dwayne
and
stops
to
look
back
at
him

she
looks
the
other
way
at
dell
and
he's

sheila
starts
walking
slowly
looking
around
where
are
you

she
turns
around
and
is
startled
by
spike
who
are
you
who

and
xander
willow
and
jenny
are
looking
through
them
doing
research
spike
that's
what
the
other
vampire
called
him
that's
a
little
unorthodox
isn't
it
maybe
he's
reformed
perhaps
he
went
by
another
name
in
times
past
well
whoever
he
is
we'll
need

water
and
a
third
unmeshable
thing
yeah
and
i
can
see
the
oil
cordelia
sees
joyce
talking
to
willow

a
woman
that
