see
buffy
cut
to
inside
close
shot
of
the
grill
the
thing
you
gotta
learn
about
the
palace
and
this
takes
a
while
pan
over
to
where
a
scraper
is
scraping
the
grease
from
the
top
of
the
grill
a
bucket
of
grease
sits
beside
it
todd
a
young
man
about
buffy's
age
is
leaning
against
the
wall
nearby
is
that
job
security
all
boils
down
to
one
simple
thing
reveal
buffy
doing
the
scraping
she
looks
over
at
todd
expectantly
politics
beat
buffy
resumes
scraping
now
i'm
not
a
political
animal
but

fast
around
here
or

wham
hello
glass
ceiling
buffy
makes
a
face
as
she
lifts
a
spatulaful
of
grease
todd
tips
the
bucket
so
she
can
dump
the
grease
into
it
she
resumes
scraping
i
mean
it's
not
like
we
work
at
burger
world
or
the
happy
bun
where
the
power
structure
is
simple
no
here
at
the
palace
you
gotta
keep
your
friends
close
but
your
enemies
closer
todd
buffy
nodding
rolling
her
eyes

and
the
day
after

cut
to
the
graveyard
later
buffy
walks
along
holding
a
small
paper
bag
with
the
double
meat
logo
she
wears
a
long
caramelcolored
coat
over
her
clothes
buffy
sings
'get

double
treat
that's
the
double
sweet
oh
it's
hard
to
beat
when
the
meat
meets'
oh
why
can't
i
get
this
stupid
jingle
out
of
my
head
a
vampire
jumps
out
in
front
of
her
least
of
your
problems
now
little
girl
wait
she
turns
to
put
the
bag
down
carefully
on
a
nearby
headstone
ooookay
buffy
turns
back
okay
let's
do
this
buffy
points
at
him
quickly
the
vamp
swings
at
her
she
ducks
then
punches
him
he
reels
aside
and
kicks
her
he
grabs
her
by
the
upper
arms
and
pulls
her
toward
him
moving
to
bite
her
neck
as
she
struggles
to
shove
him
away
then
the
vampire
pulls
back
still
holding
her
what's
that
smell
vamp
sniffing
geez
slayer
is
that
you
i've
been
working
where
in
a
slaughterhouse
buffy
pouts
double
meat
palace
ohhh
he
lets
go
and
backs
away
you
know
what
let's
just
call
it
a
night
vamp
buffy
looking
surprised
if
it's
all
the
same
to
you
and
you've
been
eating
that
stuff
i'm
not
so
sure
i
wanna
bite
you
you're
dead
you
smell
like
it
buffy
vamp
shrugging
and
nodding
how
do
you
get
to
say
i'm
the
one
who's
stinky
buffy
pouting
really
it's
it's
cool
i'll
just
catch
you
next
time
a
stake
flies
into
the
shot
and
into
his
heart
he
groans
and
dusts
buffy
looks
triumphant
for
a
moment
then
lowers
her
head
to
sniff
herself
she
makes
a
face
picks
up
her
takeout
bag
and
walks
off
wolf

open
on
exterior
of
the
summers
house
night
buffy
walks
up
the
walkway
holding
her
paper
bag
sighing
she
pauses
right
before
the
stairs
oh
for
pete's
sake
spike
she
turns
spike
appears
from
behind
a
nearby
tree
ah
it's
a
fair
cop
you
caught
me
slayer
however
in
all
honesty
i
think
we
have
to
say
this
one
doesn't
count
after
all
i
wasn't
exactly
hiding
spike
walks
toward
her
no
spike
no
what
kind
of
answer
is
that
you
haven't
even
heard
the
question
yet
i
don't
have
to
we
both
know
what
you're
thinking
spike
grins
and
we
both
know
that
i'm
not
the
only
one
thinking
it
he
puts
his
hand
out
as
if
to
grab
her
coat
collar
and
leans
in
as
if
to
kiss
her
buffy
slaps
his
hand
away
no
not
here
why
not
spike
pouting
dawn
buffy
looks
toward
the
house
she's
inside
waiting
for
dinner
she's
counting
on
me
i'm
not
letting
her
down
by
letting
you
in
so
it's
the
fear
of
getting
caught
then
is
it
reason
number
one
on
a
very
long
list
buffy
turns
to
go
needn't
be
an
obstacle
he
takes
her
hand
and
pulls
her
toward
the
tree
longer
shot
of
the
two
of
them
moving
along
the
side
of
the
building
buffy
sighs
spike
i
mean

come
on
i
hear
you're
serious
so
am
i
i
want
you
you
want
me
cut
to
a
closer
shot
as
buffy
has
her
back
up
against
the
tree
and
spike
is
right
in
her
face
i
can't
go
inside
so
maybe
the
time
is
right
for
you
to
come
outside
buffy
sighs
looks
at
the
house
then
back
at
spike
he
slowly
leans
in
to
kiss
her
cut
to
a
long
shot
again
they
kiss
buffy
drops
the
paper
bag
on
the
ground
and
spike
pulls
her
around
so
that
the
tree
obscures
them
from
our
view
cut
to
inside
buffy
comes
into
the
kitchen
holding
the
paper
bag
and
putting
her
other
hand
to
her
forehead
she
stops
and
looks
surprised

a
red
radar
screen

large
blinking

riley
gives

another
look
sorry
i've
been
dealing
with
these
these
geeks
it's
it's
a
whole
thing
sound
of
demon
growling
they
both
look
up
the
demon
which
looks
like
a
cross
between
a
teenage
mutant
ninja
turtle
and
the
alien
from
alien
is
across
the
street
knocking
over
some
newspaper
vending

and
run
away

start
forward

wild
bear
everybody

back
riley
pushes
a
pedestrian
aside
look
out
people
run
away
as
riley
approaches
the
demon
it
hits
him
slashing
his
arm
with
a
claw
and
he
reels
back
clutching
his
arm
buffy
jumps
up
onto
the
demon's
back
and
it
flings
her
off
against
a
wall
then
it
retreats
into
an
alley
a
gun
falls
to
the
ground
beside
buffy
she
gets
to
her
knees
and
picks
it
up
riley
comes
over
and
grabs
her
arm
to
help
her
up
they
look
at
each
other
buffy
turns
and
heads
toward
the
alley
with
riley
right
behind
they
walk
cautiously
down
the
alley
looking
around
they
reach
a
point
where
the
alley
widens
split
buffy
nods
they
move
off
in
different
directions
suddenly
a
garbage
can
flies
into
the
shot
toward
riley
but
he
deflects
it
sound
of
the
demon
growling
riley
buffy
tosses
him
the
gun
he
takes
aim
at
the
demon
shoots
it
the
gun
shoots
darts
rather
than
bullets
the
dart
sticks
in
the
demon's
chest
it
roars
and
flails
its
arms
around
buffy
runs
at
it
and
one
of
its
arms
hits
her
she
reels
back
against
riley
who
catches
her
the
demon
leaps
up
to
the
roof
of
the
building
and
is
gone
you

i'll
feel
better
when

walk
over
to
a
fence
and
look
down

see
that
they're
standing
at
the
top
of
a
huge
dam
far
below

can
see
the
water

uncut
stone
walls
surround
the
platform

fence
she
looks
into
his
eyes
ready
when
you

puts
her
arms
around
his
shoulders
and
they
start
down
long
shot
of
the
two
of
them
descending
along
the
side
of
the
dam
they
reach
the
bottom
and
stand
on
a
stone
platform
with
a
low
stone
wall
at
the
edge
riley
detaches
the
line
from
his
belt
they
both
start
looking
around
they
duck
past
a
large
pipe
with
a
small
trickle
of
water
coming
out
past
it
the
stone
ledge
opens
out
into
a
wider
space
with
a
ladder
at
one
wall
riley
walks
past
a
door
and
the
demon
comes
out
of
it
tackling
him
from
behind
he
throws
it
off
and
ducks
a
swing
of
its
arm
buffy
attacks
the
demon
and
gets
thrown
aside
she
leans
against
the
stone
wall
and
looks
over
her
shoulder
at
riley
grappling
with
the
demon
buffy
kicks
back
at
the
demon
and
gets
it
off
riley
he
punches
it

hits
him

hits
riley
and
then
buffy
sending
them
both
reeling
back
riley
attacks
again
and
gets
hit
in
the
stomach
he
leans
over
in
pain
riley
buffy
grabs
him
and
uses
him
as
leverage
to
lift
both
feet
off
the
ground
and
kick
the
demon
back
it
falls
to
the
ground
riley
turns
buffy
around
and
pushes
her
up
against
the
wall
they
both
pant
and
stare
deeply
at
each
other
behind
them
another
blackclad
figure
rappels
down
from
above
landing
on
the
stone
floor
nearby
it's
a
woman
with
long
dark
hair
in
a
ponytail
similar
to
buffy's
she
looks
over
at
them

hell
of
a

together
i
almost
feel
sorry
for
the
suvolte
the
demon
hits
sam
across
the
face
and
she
goes
down
but
not
quite
riley
moves
forward
picking
up
a
taser
from
the
ground
he
catches
the
demon's
arm
as
it
prepares
to

it
in
the
stomach
with
the
taser
sam
crouches
on
the
ground

the
demon
back
buffy

there
looking
pensive
as
the
other
two
continue
fighting
the
demon
the
demon
flings
them
both
off
and
buffy
wakes
up
rejoins
the
fight
sam
is
holding
the
demon's
arm
and
kicking
it
buffy
grabs
the
demon
by
its
head
call

your
wedding
gift
she
twists
the
head
snapping
the
demon's
neck
it
falls
to
the
ground
riley
moves
forward
as
if
to
stop
her
but
sees
it's
too
late
sam
looks
shocked
buffy
panting
so
guess
that's
mission
accomplished
buffy
turns
away
riley
kneels
by
the
demon
she
killed
it
oh

sam
putting
a
hand
on
his
back
panting
that's
okay
buffy
turns
back
okay

have
been
tracking
this
thing
as
a
couple
for
two
days
straight
and
you
did
want
it
dead
right
riley
stands
up
again
next
to
sam
they
look
at
each
other
nervously
oh
let
me
guess
captain
cando
over
here
sam
pointing
her
thumb
at
riley
forgot
to
mention
that
this
was
a
homing
operation
sam
riley
looking
embarrassed
getting
something
from
his
belt
but
it's
nice
to
finally
meet
you
by
the
way
knife
sam
puts
out
her
hand
without
looking
and
riley
gives
her
a
large
knife
she
kneels
beside
the
demon
what
is
a
homing
operation
it's
my
fault
i
should
have
explained
that
would
have
saved
me
some
trouble
sam
slices
open
the
demon's
stomach
with
the
knife
thick
yellow
blood
oozes
out
damn
buffy
makes
a
disgusted
face
sam
stands
up
we're
too
late
finn
how
could
you
recruit
the
slayer
without
filling
her
in
on
the
objective
that'd
be
my
question
sam
teasing
if
we
weren't
under
severe
time
constraints

new
one

looking
for
a
little
payback
sam
shakes
head
no
it
came
here
to
the
hellmouth
to
to
spawn
sam
sighs
but
we
think
it
already
hatched
its
eggs
somewhere
and
the
plan
was
to
track
it
let
the
demon
take
us
to
its
nest
and
now
they're
gonna
hatch
a
bunch
of
baby
demon
things
unless
we
stop
it
which
means
we
have
to
find
the
nest
and
fast
before
sunnydale
turns
into
the
trouble
meat
palace
beat
everyone
looks
at
buffy
i
wish
i'd
said
something
else
okay
so
we
track
down
the
demon
find
the
nest
mr
and
mrs
finn
here
make
with
the
killin'
and
everyone
goes
home
happy
xander
sits
on
the
sofa
beside
sam
but
seriously
married
man
if
forced
to
choose
between
a
photographer
and
place
settings
we
can't
track
the
demon
buffy
they
look
at
her
i
killed
it
buffy
chipper
so
who's
hungry
we
got
uh
ice
cubes
all
you
can
eat
buffy
it's
good
that
you
killed
the
suvolte
before
it
killed
us
sam
to
xander
disposable
cameras
di
wah
yeah
you
you
know
little
plastic
ones
ten
bucks
a
pop
you
arrange
them
like
table
settings
guests
snap
photos
buffy
looks
at
them
close
shot
on
riley's
hand
resting
on
sam's
knee
she
puts
her
own
hand
over
riley's
lacing
their
fingers
together
breaks
the
ice
and
when
the
wedding's
over
you
get
to
take
home
the
pictures
xander
grinning
i
like
it
shot
of
willow
and
buffy
buffy
stares
at
the
floor
while
willow
makes
snide
faces
at
sam
riley
and
sam
smile
at
xander
turn
back
to
buffy
willow
makes
an
innocent
face
so
demon
eggs
any
timetable
on
when
they're
gonna
hatch
hatching's
not
the
problem
we
think
they're
gonna
be
sold
on
the
black
market
there
are
some
foreign
military
powers
that
would
love
to
have
their
own
suvolte
you
could
never
train
it
but
drop
it
on
an
urban
population
and
it
cleanses
the
area
is
that
a
nice
way
of
saying
it
kills
people
lots
of
'em
money's
been
exchanged
there's
a
dealer
in
town
calls
himself
the
the
doctor

a
little
locating

sam
willow

to
look
at
her
gone
as
in
there's
nothing
left
i've
never
met
anyone
with
enough
strength
to
quit
before
willow
continues
looking
at
her

nothing
i'm
just
saying
sam
turns
and
leaves
willow
watches
her
go
smiles
a
little
thanks
for

tag
along
cut
to
the
graveyard
night
sam
and
buffy

wearing
their
allblack
outfits
no
problem

for
you

little
bit
intimidated

talking
about
it's
you

i
could
tell
he
was
ripped
up
inside
good
thing
he
has
you
more
like
miraculous
i
went
down
to
central
america
with
the
peace
corps
one
night
my
entire
infirmary
got

they
were
i
got
saved
quit
the
corps
joined
the
squad
my
first
firefight
i
met
riley
sam
smiling
we
started
talking
you
know
first
about
tactics
missions
stuff
like
that
and
then
about
you
he
thinks
i
let
him
go
sam
stops
do
you
wish
you
hadn't
buffy
softly
i
wish
things
were
different
ii'm
not
trying
to
i
don't
uh
you
know
buffy
resumes
walking
i
didn't
mean
to
put
you
on
the
spot
buffy
there's
no
bad
guys
in
this
one
the
only
thing
that
could
help
riley
work
it
out
was
time
lots
of
time
took
him
a
year
to
get
over
you
i'm
glad
he's
over
me
so
you
seeing
anyone
new
someone
special
you
know
i
just
take
my
time
you
know
i
don't
i
don't
wanna
jump
right
into
anything
don't
wanna
you
know
be
defined
by
who
i'm
with
yeah
better
no
guy
than
the
wrong
guy
that's
for
sure
buffy
suddenly
sam
you
know
what
um
i
think
we
should
split
up
sam
upset
oh
i'm
slowing
you
down
i
knew
i
would
this
was
just
selfish
of
me
no

this
guy
uh
an
informant
but
he's
twitchy
i
show
up
with
company
and
and
we
get
nothing
cool
i'm
guessing
finn
needs
me
about
now
sam
looking
around
he's
probably
off
somewhere
gettin'
his
ass
kicked
sam
grinning
you
know

gets
sam
backing
away
don't
worry
about
rye

instead
she
hooks
her
hand
around
his
neck
and
pulls
him
down
onto
the
coffincouch
buffy
lies
down
on
her
back
with
spike
on
top
of
her
she
begins
unbuttoning
his
shirt

pulls
at
the
fastenings
on
buffy's
bulletproof
vest
she
stares
at
his
face
pushes
the
partially
unbuttoned
shirt
down
on
his
shoulders
then
uses
it
to
pull
him
down
for
a
kiss

to
later
buffy
and

lie
on
the
crypt
sleeping
with
some
blankets
covering
them
not

each
other
one
of

bare
legs

exposed
sound
of
the
door
bursting
open
again
spike
stirs

his
head
to

and
sits
up
holding
a
blanket
over

over
to

bare
leg
spike
chuckles
props
himself
up
on
his
elbows
well

usually
use
the
word
delicious
shot
of
riley
standing
there
looking
at
them
large
gun
in
hand
but
i've
gotta
wager
this
little
tableau

sting
a
bit

your
former
must
kill
what
can
i
say
girl
just
needs
a
little
monster
in
her

ground
looking
upset

looks
shocked
turns
to
stare
at
spike
then
back
to
stare
at

looks
from
one
man
to
the
other
still
holding
the
blanket
against

sighs
here

buffy
crouches
down
scooping
up
her
clothing
scowling
at
spike
she
goes
off
somewhere
to
get
dressed
last
time
i
saw
you
if
memory
serves
you
were
getting
the
juice
sucked
out
of
you
by
some
undead
ladies
of
very
questionable
reputation
spike
sits
up
on
the
coffin
naked
with
his
knees
pulled
up
and
open
riley
averts
his
eyes
now
be
a
good
tin
soldier
and
uh
spike
makes
a
goaway
gesture
where

keep
calling
me

spike
begins
putting
on
pants
glad

little
thing
for

very
distracting
riley

riley
pointing

gun
at
spike
where

the
eggs

riley
punches

as
buffy
reappears
fully
dressed

eggs

riley
quietly

this
place
apart
until

that
nest
over
my
dead
body

seen
enough
of
your
dead
body
for
one
night
thanks
riley
uses
the
barrel
of
his
shotgun
to
shove
spike
aside
as
he
passes
spike
grabs
his
shoulder
well
you're
not
gonna
riley
shoves
him
back
spike
stumbles
back
against
a
pillar
riley
starts
down
the
ladder
to
the
underground
part
of
the
crypt
riley
os
you
coming
buffy
looks
up
looks
at
spike
he
stares
back
at
her
she
follows
riley
spike
angry
oh

is
unconstitutional

what
it
is
spike
grabbing
a
shirt
putting
it
on
here
cut
to
below
riley
and
buffy
reach
the
ground
spike
os
there's
nothin'
to

down
there
buffy
hurries
after
riley
as
he
moves
through
the
underground
rooms
riley
look
i'm
not
saying
that
he's
good
okay
i'm
just
saying
that
he's
not
capable
of
something
as
she
stops
as
they
round
a
corner
and
come
upon
the
demon
eggs
the
eggs
are
about
the
size
of
beachballs
but
brownishgrey
and
scaly
there
are
at
least
ten
possibly
more
riley
cocks
his
gun
closer
shot
of
the
eggs
surrounded
by
yellowish
goo
the
same
color
as
the
demon's
blood
spike
runs
in
wearing
the
shirt
unbuttoned
i
can
explain
we're
gonna
need
more
weapons
spike
screwed
up
you
didn't
keep
'em
frozen
did
you
doctor
you
can
stop
calling
me
that
any
time
if
i
may
the
thing
of
it
is
i'm
holding
these
for
a
friend
who
buffy
punches
him
in
the
nose
again
he
falls
down
on
his
butt
his
nose
bloody
no
more
games
spike
gets
to
his
feet
angry
well
that's
bloody
funny
coming
from
you
no
more
games
spike
buffy
rolling
her
eyes
that's
all
you've
ever
done
is
play
me
you
keep
playing
with
rules
you
make
up
as
you
like
you
know
what
i
am
you've
always
known
you
come
to
me
all
the
same
can
you
shut
him
up
not
so
far
spike
exits
you
better
get
outta
here
buffy
backs
away
riley
stands
staring
at
the
eggs
suddenly
one
of
the
eggs
bursts
open
and
a
baby
demon
pops
out
screeching
it
looks
a
bit
like
a
crab
or
a
very
large
cockroach
on
second
thought
stick
around
riley
tosses
his
gun
to
buffy
and
pulls
out
the
taser
more
baby
demons
pop
out
of
the
eggs
and
move
toward
them
fast
riley
and
buffy
back
away
riley
i
aim
high
plenty
of
lead
i'm
not
exactly
gun
girl
you
wanna
live
learn
fast
buffy
fires
the
gun
randomly
it
hits
a
stack
of
lp
records
shattering
them
another
shot
hits
a
pillow
on
the
bed
feathers
fly
a
third
shot
destroys
a
lamp
these
things
buffy
uses
the
gun
to
club
a
demon
as
it
flies
at
her
never
useful
she
tosses
the
gun
away
she
and
riley
look
around
several
of
the
babies
are
scurrying
across
the
ceiling
we
have
to
pull
out
one
demon
falls
onto
riley's
shoulder
he
grabs
at
it
pries
it
off
he
and
buffy
begin
to
run
for
the
exit
the
baby
demons
pursue
buffy
looks
around
the
baby
demons
are
crawling
across
every
bit
of
ceiling
and
wall
she
runs
for
the
ladder
cut
to
above
buffy
emerges
as
riley
is
lying
on
the
floor
just
next
to
the
opening
to
below
we
need
a
way
to
contain
these
things
riley
buffy
grabs
riley's
belt
detaches
it
there
are
several
grenades
on
it
she
pulls
the
pin
on
one
and
drops
the
entire
belt
down
into
the
hole
get
down
buffy
lies
down
on
top
of
riley
shielding
him
shot
of
the
belt
lying
by
the
base
of
the
ladder
as
the
baby
demons
move
around
and
past
it
wide
shot
of
the
underground
part
of
the
crypt
as
the
grenades
go
off
fire
bursts
across
the
cavern
and
engulfs
the
eggs
wide
shot
of
the
above
as
a
fireball
shoots
up
from
the
opening
while
buffy
and
riley
lie
on
the
floor
cringing
the
fire
subsides
and
buffy
lifts
her
head
she
and
riley
are
both
panting
she
lies
fully
on
top
of
him
you
know
if
you
love
riley
finn
so
much
maybe
you
should
just
marry
him
cut
to
close
shot
of
xander
he's
taken
and
that's
not
the
point
cut
to
wider
shot
we
see
xander
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bathtub
and
anya
sitting
beside
him
on
the
closed
toilet
faint
sounds
of
angry
voices
in
background
so
you
think
that
their
marriage
is
better
than
ours
is
that
it
no
but
granted
i
have
a
hard
time
imagining
nick
and
nora
fury
hiding
out
from
their
own
relatives
in
the
bathroom
sound
of
crashing
and
banging
from
outside
they
both
look
toward
the
door
in
alarm
xander
sighs
and
i
have
no
idea
what
riley
and
mrs
riley's
wedding
was
like
well
you
haven't
shut
up
about
them
well
they
have
a
great
marriage
and
it
bummed
buffy
out
but
i
can
see
it
and
anya
i
really
have
no
clue
what
their
wedding
was
like
so
our
wedding
anya
xander
nodding
is
not
our
marriage
anya
smiles
separate
things
one
fills
me
with
a
dread
akin
to
public
speaking
engagements
and
that
would
be
the
wedding
which
will
be
over
soon

for
the
whole

was
terrified
about

i'm
sure
my
incredible
patheticness
softened
the
blow
for
you

a
bit
i
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about
riley
please
don't
patronize

you
want
me
to
say
that
i
liked
seeing
you
in
bed
with
that
idiot
or
that
blinding
orange

your
very
best
color
or
that
that
burger
smell
is
appealing
buffy
upset

smelled
the
smell
buffy
none
of
that
means
anything
it
doesn't
touch
you

still
the
first
woman
i
ever
loved
and
the
strongest
woman
i've
ever
known

i'm
not
advertising
this
to
the
missus
but
you're
still
quite
the
hottie

i
kinda
love
her

i
made
it
worse

wheel
never
stops
turning
buffy
you're
up

down

doesn't
change
what
you
are
and
you
are
a
hell
of
a
woman
buffy
deep
breath
riley
that
night
buffy
riley
just
looking
at
her

was
about
what
happened
between
us
and
you
never
have
to
the
door
to
the
magic
shop
opens
again
and
sam
and
xander
emerge
followed
by
dawn
and
willow

the
wedding
itself
was
held
in
a
military
chopper
just
before

hairy
night

into
hostile
territory

amused
look

and
xander
in
background
so

time
dawn
sound
of
a
helicopter

i
warrant
a
hug
dawn
doesn't
smile
but
she
steps
forward
and
hugs
riley
then
he
pulls
back
to
look
at
her
face
goodbye
dawn

thought

would
suck
less

time

doesn't
riley
smiles
fondly
at
her
it
was
really
nice
meeting
you
all
sam
taps
riley
on
the
shoulder
moves
away
you
ready
for
nepal
agent
riley
to
xander
soldier
riley
follows
sam
onto
the
street
the
helicopter
noise
is
louder
and
we
see
its
lights
shining
on
the
group
riley
and
sam
move
a
bit
away
from
the
others
riley
to
sam
firefights
bug
hunts
big
body
counts
yeah
i
could
use
a
break
a
thin
wire
drops
down
from
the
copter
riley
attaches
it
to
his
belt
he
and
sam
put
their
arms
around
each
other
and
riley
tugs
on
the
line
to
signal
the
copter
long
shot
of
the
two
of
them
rising
into
the
air
as
the
others
stand
watching
buffy
stands
a
little
ways
off
from
the
others
willow
waves
bye
bye
bye
riley
bye
sam
the
helicopter
moves
away
with
riley
and
sam
still
dangling
from
it
angle
on
the
others
watching
dawn
and
xander
turn
and
walk
off
left
out
of
shot
willow
moves
right
over
to
buffy
still
waving
what
a
bitch
willow
turns
and
follows
xander
and
dawn
away
buffy
watches
her
go
then
looks
back
up
at
the
departing
helicopter
pensive
fade
to
spike's
crypt
spike
stands
there
looking
at
the
mess
his
furniture
and
possessions
bits
of
demon
all
scattered
around
everywhere
burnt
and
charred
he
nudges
a
bit
of
rubble
with
his
foot
sighs
stares
at
the
floor
buffy
appears
stops
a
little
ways
off
spike
doesn't
look
at
her
so
she's
back
thought
you'd
be
off
snogging
with
soldierboy
he's
gone
spike
looks
at
her
so
you
come
for
a
bit
of
cold
comfort
spike
sighs
gestures
the
bed's
a
bit
blown
up
but
then
that
was
never
our
i'm
not
here
to
she
breaks
off
spike
just
looks
at
her
and
i'm
not
here
to
bust
your
chops
about
your
stupid
scheme
either
that's
just
you
i
should
have
remembered
so
this
is
worse
then
is
it
this
is
you
telling
me
it's
over
spike
smiles
moves
closer
to
her
i've
memorized
this
tune
luv
think
i
have
the
sheet
music
doesn't
change
what
you
want
i
know
that
buffy
pauses
i
do
want
you
buffy
spike
looking
surprised
being
with
you
makes
things
simpler
for
a
little
while
i
don't
call
five
hours
straight
a
little
while
i'm
using
you
he
stares
at
her
i
can't
love
you
i'm
just
being
weak
and
selfish
spike
moves
even
closer
really
not
complaining
here
and
it's
killing
me
spike
frowns
i
have
to
be
strong
about
this
he
continues
staring
at
her
i'm
sorry
william
she
turns
and
walks
off
leaving
spike
looking
stricken
cut
to
above
buffy
walks
out
of
the
crypt
into
sunlight
blackout
