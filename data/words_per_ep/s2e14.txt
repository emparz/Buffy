spike's
warehouse
the
judge
is
kneeling
in
a
corner
facing
a
bunch
of
storage
racks
spike
wheels
into
view
and
stops
about
twenty
feet
from
him
he
pushes
himself
a
few
feet
closer
and
turns
around

the
slayer

still
alive

sits
there
spike
looks

his
eyes
yeah
spike
turns
and
wheels
over
to
him
it's
interesting
to
me
that
'preparing'
looks
a
great
bit
like
sitting
on
your
ass
spike
facing
him

do
we
destroy
the
world

strength
grows

floor
and
begins
to
cry
angel
spike
concerned

spike
stops
by
her
dru
the
camera
pans
around

crying
gives
way
to
an
evil
smile
cut
to
angel's
apartment
buffy
stirs
in
his
bed
and
reaches
over
for
him
she
opens
her
eyes
suddenly
wide
awake
when
she
doesn't
find
him
there
and
looks
around

sits
up
in

still
raining
hard
and

strikes

looks
around

is
nowhere
to
be
seen

let
up

falls
to
the
pavement
and

himself
up

hold
himself
up
and
collapses
to
the
ground

frightened

doorway
sees
him
and
slowly

over
to
him

pain
is
gone

spins
around
game

on
grabs
her
and
violently
bites
her
on
the
neck
to
feed

his
head
up
and
blows
out

smoke

as

comes
over
to
her
she
turns
to
face
him
sorry

i'm
reeling
from
that
new
experience

you
were
too
busy
rushing
off
to
die
for
your
beloved
buffy

never
die
for

other
part
cordelia
smiles
xander
smiles
back
and
they
start
to
kiss
after
a
few
moments
cordelia
giggles
and
smiles
and
they
pull
apart
willow
is
standing
behind
them
completely
confused
and
upset
willow
uh
she
darts
off
xander
runs
after
her
we
were
just
willow
willow
cordelia
realizes
they've
been
found
out
and
begins
to
consider
the
implications
cut
to
the
halls
willow
comes
running
out
of
the
library
xander
is
right
behind
her
willow
come
on
willow
stops
and
confronts
him
shaking
her
finger
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
well
not
'knew
it'
in
the
sense
of
having
the
slightest
idea
but
i
knew
there
was
something
i
didn't
know
you
two
were
fighting
way
too
much
it's
not
natural
i
know
it's
weird
weird
it's
against
all
laws
of
god
and
man
it's
willow
disgusted
cordelia
remember
the
the
'we
hate
cordelia'
club
of
which
you
are
the
treasurer
look
i
was
gonna
tell
you
gee
what
stopped
you
could
it
be
shame
all
right
let's
overreact
shall
we
but
i'm
willow
we
were
just
kissing
it
doesn't
mean
that
much
no
it
just
means
that
you'd
rather
be
with
someone
you
hate
than
be
with
me
she
runs
from
the
hall
leaving
xander
just
standing
there
to
consider
her
words
he
reluctantly
turns
to
go
back
into
the
library
cut
to
the
summers
house
buffy
comes
up
the
walkway
to
the
porch
she
looks
at
her
door
a
moment
then
turns
and
goes
away
cut
to
angelus'
apartment
buffy
opens
the
door
comes
in
and
closes
it
behind
her
she
walks
over
to
the
bed
and
sees
it's
been
made
one
of
his
shirts
is
laid
out
on
it
she
goes
over
to
the
bed
and
reaches
for
the
shirt
behind
her
angelus
steps
over
to
a
statue
picks
up
a
necklace
hanging
from
it
and
puts
it
on

at
all
pulls
it
on
it
happened
i
i
don't
understand
was
it
mme
buffy
meekly
was
i
not
good
angelus
laughs
you
were
great
really
angelus
snidely
i
thought
you
were
a
pro
how
can
you
say
this
to
me
lighten
up
it
was
a
good
time
it
doesn't
mean
like
we
have
to
make
a
big
deal
it
is
a
big
deal
it's
what
bells
ringing
fireworks
a
dulcet
choir
of
pretty
little
birdies
angelus
laughs
come
on
buffy
it's
not
like
i've
never
been
there
before
he
reaches
his
hand
up
to
her
face
and
she
jerks
back
don't
touch
me
angelus
shakes
his
finger
at
her
i
should've
known
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
handle
it
angelus
starts
to
go
angel
buffy
he
stops
and
faces
her
buffy
tearyeyed
i
love
you
angelus
points
coolly
at
her
love
you
too
angelus
turns
away
i'll
call
you
he
goes
out
the
door
buffy
can
only
watch
him
go
extremely
upset
and
confused
cut
to
enyos'
hotel
room
he
lectures
jenny
you
know
what
it
is
this
thing
vengeance
uncle
i
have
served
you
i
have
been
faithful
i
need
to
know
enyos
interrupts
to
the
modern
man
vengeance
is
a
verb
an
idea
payback
one
thing
for
another
like
commerce
not
with
us
vengeance
is
a
living
thing
it
passes
through
generations
it
commands
it
kills
you
told
me
to
watch
angel
you
told
me
to
keep
him
from
the
slayer
i
tried
but
there
are
other
factors
there
are
terrible
things
happening
here
that
we
cannot
control
we
control
nothing
we
are
not
wizards
janna
we
merely
play
our
part
angel
could
be
of
help
to
us
i
mean
he
may
be
the
only
chance
we
have
to
stop
the
judge
it
is
too
late
for
that
why
the
curse
angel
is
meant
to
suffer
not
to
live
as
human
one
moment
of
true
happiness
of
contentment
one
moment
where
the
soul
that
we
restored
no
longer
plagues
his
thoughts
and
that
soul
is
taken
from
him
then
if
somehow
if
if
it's
happened
then
angelus
is
back
i
hoped
to
stop
it
but
i
realize
now
it
was
arranged
to
be
so
buffy
loves
him
and
now
she
will
have
to
kill
him
jenny
stands
up
unless
he
kills
her
first
uncle
this
is
insanity
people
are
going
to
die
yes
it
is
not
justice
we
serve
it
is
vengeance
jenny
exhales
and
grabs
her
coat
and
bag
you
are
a
fool
we're
all
fools
her
uncle
just
watches
her
go
and
shakes
his
head
cut
to
the
lounge
at
school
willow
comes
down
the
hall
xander
comes
out
of
the
bathroom
sees
her
there
and
jogs
over
to
her
will
she
hugs
her
arms
around
herself
and
turns
to
face
him
hey

you
go
home

glad
you
came
back
we

understand
it
i
don't
wanna
understand
it
you
have
gross
emotional
problems
and
things
are
not
okay
between
us
but
what's
happening
right
now
is
more
important
than
that
okay
willow
drops
her
arms
what
about
the
judge
where
do
we
stand
on
a
pile
of
really
boring
books

say
exactly
the
same
thing

guess
'no
weapon

xander
'it
took
an
army'
willow

an
army
when
you
need

behind
him
why

it
to
me

angelus
spins
around
with
willow
to
face
her
well
it's
not
really
the
kind
of
message
you
tell
it
sort
of
involves
finding
the
bodies
of
all
your
friends
he
tightens
his
grip
on
willow
even
more
and
she
lets
out
another
pained
yelp
this
can't
be
you
gee
we
already

be
some
part
of
you
inside
that
still
remembers

xander
takes
the
cross
from
jenny
and
starts
toward
angelus
your
boyfriend

willow
alone
and
deal
with
me
but
she's
so
cute
angelus
pinches
her
cheek
and
helpless
xander
gets
closer
really
a
turnon
xander
shoves
the
cross
into
angelus'
face
from
behind
he
reels
back
and
drops
willow
she
cries
out
as
she
falls
backward
into
xander
and
they
collapse
against
the
wall
angelus
turns
to
jenny
and
wards
her
off
with
a
hand
as
he
starts
to
back
down
the
hall
when
he
reaches
buffy
he
grabs
her
by
the
shoulders
she
inhales
in
fright
angelus
whispers
things
are
about
to
get
very
interesting

her
into

shut
up
cut
to
the

buffy
runs
out
of
the

and
down
the

cut
back
into
the
library
this
is
great
there's
an
unkillable
demon
in
town
angel's
joined
his
team
the
slayer
is
a
basket
case
i'd
say

hit
bottom
i
have
a
plan
oh
no
here's
a
lower
place
i
don't
know
what's
up
with
angel
but
i
think
i
may
have
a
way
to
deal
with
this
judge
guy
sits
on
the
table
by
cordelia
what
do
we
do
i
think
um
xander
looks
at
cordelia
then
back
at
willow
i
think
i
may
need
cordelia
for
this
one
willow
lowers
her
eyes
for
just
an
instant
and
we
may
need
wheels
well
my
car
is
it
might
have
to
be
bigger
no
problem
i'll
get
oz
he

a
van
good
xander

at
cordelia
okay

the
plan

a
part
of
no

incensed
and
follows
him
i'm
not

up
on

sniffs
as
she
unbuttons
her
coat
she
sees
her
cross
and
necklace
hanging
from
its
hook
and
takes
it
in
her
hand

sparkles
in
the
light
she
lets

it
letting

swing
she
looks
down
at
the
ring
on
her
hand
that
angel
gave
her

pulls
it
off
of
her
finger
and
looks
at
it
bursting
into
tears
she
goes
to
her
bed
and
lies
on
it
clutching
the
ring
and
crying
uncontrollably
the
camera
pulls
back
from
her
as
she
curls
up
on
her
bed
eventually
she
falls
asleep
and
dreams
she
and

are

cut
to
a
funeral
in
bright
daylight
angel
walks
up
to
the
grave
buffy
looks
over
at

looks
up
at
her
his
face
bathed
in
sunlight
you
have
to
know
what
to
see
she
looks
at
him
not
really
understanding
and
then
back
down
at
the
grave
she
looks
over
at

attending
the
funeral
and
sees

lifting
the
veil
from

but
her
footing
is
good
and
she
regains
her
balance
he
kicks
her
in
the
face
and

up
a
piece
of
the
judge's
armor

series
of
punches
to
his
gut

with
a
punch
to
his
face
he
isn't
fazed
and
lunges
at
her
she
grabs
his
arm
and
diverts
him
into
a
display
case
he
crashes
through
the
glass
but
immediately
straightens
back
up
breaking
the
top
pane
and
the
frame
of
the
case
as
well
she
kicks
him
in
the
face
and
again
in
the
chest
and
he
staggers
backward
into
a
potted
tree

pulls
out
a
stake
and
stands
ready
to
finish
the
job
angelus
straightens
up
and
faces
her
buffy
doesn't

lowers
the
stake
and
just
stares
at
him
you

kill
me

anger
takes
over

grabs
his
groin
and
