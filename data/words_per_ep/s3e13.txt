prologue

a
cave
there
is
a
thick
mist
obscuring
the
view
a
redeyed
bluish
gray
skinned
demon
angrily
searches
through
the
fog
for
those
who
have
attacked
it
and
its
kindred
two
of
which
already
lie
dead
on
the
cave's
floor
faith
is
standing
in
an
alcove
watching
the
demon's
movements
buffy
is
up
on
a
ledge
watching
the
demon
anxiously
giles
is
off
in
a
corner
waiting
for
the
right
moment
willow
slowly
steps
around
the
corner
of
the
cave
entrance
carrying
a
large
lit
candle
when
she's
in
view
of
the
main
chamber
and
senses
the
moment
is
right
she
quietly
speaks
her
spell
obscurate
nos
non
diutius
do
not
conceal
any
longer
she
blows
out
the
candle
and
a
wind
quickly
sucks
the
fog
out
of
the
cave
the
demon
is
now
clearly
visible
to
everyone
its
teeth
are
sharp
yet
there
are
no
fangs
it
has
very
long
pointed
ears
and
a
series
of
horns
starting
just
above
its
eyes
and
continuing
up
on
its
high
thick
forehead
it
growls
as
it
turns
around
trying
to
get
a
clear
look
at
what's
there
when
it's
facing
her
buffy
jumps
from
the
ledge
and
tackles
the
demon
to
the
ground
giles
comes
out
of
his
corner
and
grabs
one
of
its
arms
buffy
grabs
the
other
as
she
scrambles
to
her
feet
and
together
they
drag
the
demon
up
and
slam
it
against
a
wall
it
wraps
its
arm
around
giles'
shoulder
and
throws
him
off
he
hits
an
adjacent
wall
and
falls
to
the
ground
buffy
yells
now
faith
comes
out
of
her
alcove
holding
a
sword
up
in
both
hands
and
charges
the
demon
before
it
can
react
faith
has
plunged
the
sword
through
its
heart
the
demon
screams
in
agony
giles
looks
up
and
watches
as
faith
pulls
the
sword
back
out
of
the
demon's
chest
buffy
releases
it
and
allows
it
to
fall
giles
rolls
out
of
the
way
as
it
hits
face
down
on
the
ground
he
rolls
back
a
bit
and
looks
at
the
body
lying
next
to
him
faith
lowers
her
sword
buffy
looks
down
at
the
demon
relieved
that
the
fight
is
over
i
think
that
was
the
last
willow
comes
in
from
the
entrance
visibly
shaken
but
trying
to
cover
it
with
a
smile
buffy
bends
down
to
help
up
giles
willow
you
okay
willow
breathing
hard
yeah
i'm
fine
ththe
shaking
is
is
a
side
effect
of
the
fear
giles
on
his
feet
thank
you
giles
takes
off
his
glasses
and
rubs
his
brow
well
if
it
wasn't
for
that
clouding
spell
willow
smiles
yeah
it
went
good
willow
glances
at
the
candle
nothing
melted
like
last
time
these
babes
were
wicked
rowdy
what's
their
deal
i
wish
i
knew
he
crouches
down
and
rolls
the
demon
over
to
get
a
good
look
at
it
faith
looks
with
disgust
at
another
one
of
them
most
of
my
sources
have
dried
up
since
the
uh
council
has
relieved
me
of
my
duties
i
was
aware
there
was
a
nest
here
but
quite
frankly
i
expected
it
to
be
vampires
these
these
are
new
and
improved
giles
stands
up
yes
i'm
sorry
i
should've
had
you
better
prepared
and
i
should
never
have
allowed
willow
and
uh
giles
looks
around
and
uh
they
all
realize
that
xander
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
just
then
they
hear
something
stirring
under
a
pile
of
garbage
there
they
see
xander
crawling
out
from
under
a
collapsed
cardboard
box
and
other
refuse
xander
out
of
breath
i'm
good
we're
fine
xander
gets
up
just
a
little
bit
dirty
xander
gives
two
thumbs
up
good
show
everyone
xander
staggers
out
into
the
cave
just
great
i
think
we
have
a
hit
willow
concerned
are
you
okay
tiptop
xander
exhales
really
if
anyone
sees
my
spine
laying
around
just
try
not
to
step
on
it
buffy
worried
xander
one
of
these
days
you're
gonna
get
yourself
hurt
or
killed
or
both
aand
you
know
with
the
pain
and
the
death
maybe
you
shouldn't
be
leaping
into
the
fray
like
that
mmaybe
you
should
be
frayadjacent
xander
slightly
miffed
excuse
me
who
at
a
crucial
moment
distracted
the
lead
demon
by
allowing
her
to
pummel
him
about
the
head
yeah
that
was
real
manly
how
you
shrieked
and
all
xander
haughtily
i
think
you'll
find
that
was
more
of
a
bellow
uh
what
do
we
do
with
the
trio
here
should
we
burn
them
willow
smiles
i
brought
marshmallows
everyone
gives
her
a
surprised
look
giles
puts
his
glasses
back
on
willow
with
dignity
occasionally
i'm
callous
and
strange
i
expect
we
can
leave
them
i'm
more
interested
in
finding
out
what
they
are
and
whether
we
can
expect
more
of
their
kind
buffy
starts
out
of
the
cave
i
hope
not
they're
way
too
fit
faith
is
right
behind
her
i
say
bring
'em
on
willow
follows
the
slayers
out
giles
steps
up
to
xander
and
puts
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
uh
xander
i
think
in
the
future
perhaps
it
would
be
best
if
you
you
uh
hhung
back
to
the
rear
of
the
battle
you
know
for
your
own
sake
he
lets
go
of
the
boy
and
takes
one
more
look
around
before
following
the
others
out
xander
is
just
ahead
of
him
xander
facetiously
but
gee
mr
white
if
clark
and
lois

all
the
good
stories
i'll
never
be
a
good
reporter

awkwardly
away
from
him
and
over
to
jack
o'toole
sitting
alone
eating
his
lunch
the
ball
hits
jack
in
the
hands
knocking
his
bag
of
chips
to
the
ground
he
looks
down
at
his
scattered
chips
in
surprise
and
snatches
up
the
ball
xander
stops
running
and
steps
up
to
him
jack
stands
up
holding
the
ball
in
his
hands

very
sad
for
him
xander
grins
is

not
amused
what
are
you
retarded
no
no
i
had
to
take
that
test
when
i
was
seven
a
little
slow
in
some
stuff
mostly
math
and
spatial
relations
but
certainly
not
challenged
or
anything
xander
points
down
can
i
get
you
another
soda
i
oughtta
cut
your
face
open
xander
nervous
hey
hey
whoa
whoa
whoa

was
an
accident
cool
down
jack
smiles
thinly
you
wanna
be
startin'
somethin'
what
starting
something
xander
grins
like
that
michael
jackson
song
right
xander
chuckles
that
was
a
lot
of
fun
'too
high
to
get
over
yeah
yeah'
remember
that
fun
song
jack
takes
a
step
toward
him
xander
steps
away
nervously
i
get
my
buddies
together
we're
gonna
kick
your
ass
till
it's
a
brandnew
shape
xander
knows
he's
not
kidding
jack
tosses
the
ball
to
him
hard
now
get
outta
here
xander
wastes
no
time
walking
away
yo
man
the
ball
xander
throws
it
to
him
cordelia
is
right
there
and
he
steps
over
to
her
boy
of
all
the
humiliations
you've
had
i've
witnessed
that
was
the
latest
xander
points
back
at
jack
i
could've
taken
him
oh
please
o'toole
would
macrame'
your
face
he
is
a
psycho
which
is
still
a
lot
cooler
than
being
a
wuss
xander
glances
at
jack
why
is
it
that
i've
come
facetoface
with
vampires
demons
the
most
hideous
creatures
hell
ever
spit
out
and
i'm
still
afraid
of
a
little
bully
like
jack
o'toole
because
unlike
all
those
creatures
that
you've
come
faceto
face
with
jack
actually
noticed
you
were
there
why
am
i
surprised
by
how
comforting
you're
not
it
must
be
really
hard
when
all
your
friends
have
like
superpowers
slayer
werewolf
witches
vampires
and
you're
like
this
little
nothing
cordelia
xander
looks
down
you
must
feel
like
jimmy
olsen
xander
chuckles
i
was
just
talking
to
xander
suddenly
offended
hey
mind
your
own
business
ooo
i
struck
a
nerve
the
boy
that
had
no
cool
i
happen
to
be
an
integral
part
of
that
group
i
happen
to
have
a
lot
to
offer
cordelia
starts
to
leave
oh
please
i
do
cordelia
stops
and
turns
back
'integral
part'
of
the
group
xander
you're
the
the
useless
part
of
the
group
you're
the
zeppo
cordelia
xander
glances
at
jack
'cool'
look
it
up
it's
something
that
a
subliterate
that's
repeated
twelfth
grade
three
times
has
and
you
don't
she
turns
and
walks
away
with
a
satisfied
smile
on
her
face
xander
is
left
in
her
dust
there
was
no
part
of
that
that
wasn't
fun
cut
to
the
cafeteria
today
it's
krautdogs
or
spaghetti
the
camera
pans
past
the
steam
table
as
the
kitchen
staff
doles
out
the
food
it
pans
up
to
show
xander
and
oz
sitting
at
a
table
finishing
their
lunch
but
it's
just
that
it's
buggin'
me
this
'cool'
thing
xander
cut
to
them
i
mean
what
is
it
how
do
you
get
it
who
doesn't
have
it
and
who
decides
who
doesn't
have
it
what
is
the
essence
of
cool
not
sure
oz
reaches
for
a
chip
i
mean
you
yourself
oz
are
considered
more
or
less
cool
why
is
that
am
i
oz
eats
a
chip
is
it
about
the
talking
you
know
the
way
you
tend
to
express
yourself
in
short
noncommittal
phrases
oz
considers
could
be
xander
smiles
i
know
you're
in
a
band
that's
like
a
businessclass
ticket
to
cool
with
complementary
mojo
after
takeoff
i
gotta
learn
an
instrument
is
it
hard
to
play
guitar
oz
shakes
his
head
not
the
way
i
play
it
okay
but
on
the
other
hand
eighth
grade
i'm
taking
the
fl√ºgelhorn
and
gettin'
zero
trim
so
the
whole
instrument
thing
could
be
a
mislead
xander
thinks
but
you
need
a
thing
one
thing
nobody
else
has
what
do
i
have
an
exciting
new
obsession
which
i
feel
makes
you
very
special
now
with
the
mocking
which
i
can
handle
because
i
know
i'm
right
about
this
i'm
on
the
track
i
just
need
to
find
my
thing
xander
gets
lost
in
thought
it
seems
like
you're
overthinking
it
i
mean
you
got
some
identity
issues
it's
not
cut
to
the
library
that
evening
giles
walks
out
of
the
cage
past
buffy
the
end
of
the
world
giles
heads
behind
the
counter
buffy
turns
can
they
do
that
buffy
goes
to
the
counter
they
seem
fairly
committed
giles
gets
a
book
the
sisterhood
of
jhe
giles
brings
it
over
is
an
apocalypse
cult
they
exist
solely
to
bring
about
the
world's
destruction
and
we've
not
seen
the
last
of
them
more
will
follow
and
they're
here
in
sunnydale
for
what
demon
expo
giles
takes
off
his
glasses
buffy
this
is
no
laughing
matter
hence
my
no
laughing
i'm
sorry
giles
slips
his
glasses
back
on
i
know
i'm
no
longer
your
official
watcher
but
the
library
door
opens
and
they
look
up
to
see
oz
come
in
hey
hey
the
clock
on
the
wall
behind
giles
shows
it's
5
20pm
giles
checks
his
watch
um
yyou're
cutting
it
a
bit
close
oz
steps
into
the
cage
well
you
know
me
he
pulls
the
door
closed
behind
him
the
privacy
towels
have
already
been
put
up
he
begins
to
undress
starting
with
his
jacket
buffy
to
giles
well
do
we
know
why
they're
here
i
think
so
giles
looks
around
based
on
some
artifacts
i
i
found
with
them
and
um
giles
sees
and
reaches
for
another
book
taking
into
account
the
current
astral
cycle
buffy
interrupts
giles
i
don't
need
to
see
the
math
he
puts
down
the
book
and
steps
back
to
the
counter
giles
seriously
they
intend
to
open
the
hellmouth
buffy
looks
up
in
surprise
the
hellmouth
the
one
that
opens
about
twenty
feet
from
where
you're
standing
she
looks
behind
her
at
the
area
where
it
last
opened
nearly
two
years
before
where
the
study
table
stands
surrounded
by
a
semicircle
of
low
book
shelves
and
the
stack
level
behind
them
oz
has
turned
into
a
werewolf
and
leaps
up
against
the
cage
he
growls
when
he
can't
break
through
looks
up
and
howls
cut
to
the
front
of
the
school
the
next
morning
willow
and
buffy
are
arriving
and
if
it
opens
do
you
remember
the
demon
that
almost
got
out
the
night
i
died
every
nightmare
i
have
that
doesn't
revolve
around
academic
failure
or
public
nudity
is
about
that
thing
in
fact
once
i
dreamt
that
it
attacked
me
while
i
was
late
for
a
test
and
naked
well
it'll
be
the
first
to
come
out
and
giles
says
it
won't
be
the
worst
by
a
long
shot
the
world
will
be
overrun
with
demons
if
we
don't
stop
it
they
start
to
cross
the
street
toward
the
steps
do
we
know
when
this
is
supposed
to
happen
buffy
shrugs
giles
is
trying
to
narrow
it
down
iif
you're
up
for
it
we're
heading
into
deep
research
mode
i'd
be
offended
if
you
haven't
already
counted
me
in
thanks
will
there's
something
about
this
one
that
scares
me
buffy
puts
her
arm
around
her
friend
i
need
my
willow
oh
you
don't
have
to
be
afraid
they've
reached
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
both
jump
when
they
hear
a
car
pull
up
behind
them
with
the
horn
honking
they
spin
around
to
see
what's
going
on
there
they
see
xander
behind
the
wheel
of
a
light
blue
1957
chevrolet

sexy
blonde
approaching

your

surprised
by

attention

xander
has
no
idea
uh
very
possibly
lysette
abruptly
how
does
she
handle
cordelia
is
fascinated
by
this
display
like
a
dream
about
warm
sticky
things
he
shoots
cordelia
a
look
she
just
raises
her
eyebrows
at
him
xander
to
the
girl
would
you
like
to
go
for
a
little
drive
you
busy
xander
holds
up
the
doughnut
box
just
gotta
drop
this
stuff
off
and
then
i
would
describe
myself
as
xander
making
a
face
at
cordelia
expendable
cordelia
gives
him
a
little
huff
the
blonde
smiles
at
xander
and
tilts
her
head
indicating
he
should
open
the
door
for
her
he
does
so
giving
cordelia
a
glance
as
lysette
gets
in
he
closes
the
door
and
jumps
up
onto
the
back
seat
and
scrambles
over
to
the
driver's
seat
he
has
some
difficulty
sitting
down
with
the
huge
steering
wheel
in
the
way
but
manages
well
enough
lysette
doesn't
care
obviously
more
impressed
with
the
car
than
with
him
xander
starts
the
car
puts
it
in
drive
gives
cordelia
one
last
look
and
burns
a
bit
of
rubber
as
he
pulls
away
from
the
curb
cut
to
the
bronze
that
evening
xander
and
lysette
are
sitting
at
a
table
with
their
drinks
he
looks
very
bored
as
he
listens
to
her
chattering
on
and
then
i
started
seeing
dave
peck
had
a
thunderbird
engine
completely
tricked
out
but
the
upholstery
was
kind
of
shot

passenger's
side

closed
i

xander
starts

like

some
sorta
klutz
he
steps
on
the
gas
without
even
looking
ahead
the
car
lurches
forward
and
promptly
hits
the
car
parked
in
front
of
them
xander
slams
on
the
brakes
and
puts
the
car
into
park
oh
god

alright
he
gets
out
of
the
car
and
gingerly
steps
to
the
front
of
the
car
there
is
only
some
slight
bumper
damage
and
a
broken
taillight
on
the
other
car

sees

looking
angrily
back
at

just
stands
and
stares
at
xander
for
a
long
moment
letting
the
fear
sink
in

around

and
hooks
it
behind
his
ear
forcing

to
look
at

quakes
with
fear
jack
jeeringly
are
you
scared
he
traces
the
tip
of
the
blade
around
xander's
neck
and
cheek
xander
shakily
would
that
make
you
happy
jack
sneering
your
woman
looking

can't
stand
up
to

with
his
head
and

propped
up
against
the
cabinets
he's
been
very
badly
beaten

the
blood
flows
freely
from
several
cuts
in
his
head
tonight

nods
laboring
to
breathe
before
sunrise
that's
what
they
said
willy
winces
in
pain
buffy
looks
at
the
damage
why
did
they
do
this
they
were
looking
for
angel
angel
why
willy
breathing
shallowly
said
they
were
coming
after

in

between
shallow
breaths
if

him
xander
runs
across
the
street
and
into
the
outside
seating
area
of
the
espresso
pump
they
all
give
chase
xander
waits
for
them
to
follow
him
into
the
cafe'
then
makes
another
break
for
it
jumping
up
onto
a
table
and
hopping
over
the
low
wall
surrounding
the
area
he
runs
back
across
the
street
and
jumps
into
the
car

motor

seething
with
anger
it's
alright
we'll
get
more
the
night
is
young
they
all
head
back
into
the
hardware
store
for
more
supplies
cut
to
xander
driving
along
the
street
very
relieved
to
have
escaped
i'd
say
that's
pretty
much
enough
excitement
for
one
evening
cut
to
a
park
faith
gets
thrown
against
a
fence
pulled
off
and
thrown
against
it
again
by
a
member
of
the
sisterhood
of
jhe
the
demon
pulls
her
off
again
but
faith
shakes
loose
and
does
a
backhand
swing
at
the
demon's
head
making
it
snap
hard
to
the
side
faith
then
punches
it
in
the
gut
and
tries
for
a
second
hit
to
the
head
but
the
demon
blocks
the
attempt
grabs
faith's
arms
and
throws
her
to
the
ground
faith
rolls
and
comes
back
up
to
a
fighting
stance
the
demon
lunges
at
her
but
she
kicks
it
in
the
knee
and
then
roundhouse
kicks
it
in
the
head
without
pausing
faith
launches
into
a
half
spinning
high
wheel
kick
which
the
demon
blocks
with
both
arms
the
demon
throws
faith's
leg
down
grabs
onto
her
jacket
and
swings
her
around
and
back
into
the
fence
back
in
the
street
xander
rounds
a
corner
and
sees
the
fight
in
the
park
ahead
of
him
the
demon
rushes
faith
who
grabs
the
fence
behind
her
and
lifts
herself
up
to
do
a
twin
push
kick
to
the
demon's
gut
shoving
her
back
hard
xander
sees
his
opening
and
just
drives
right
into
the
demon
knocking
it
back
quite
a
ways
onto
its
ass
he
backs
the
car
out
into
the
street
again
as
faith
watches
the
demon
gets
back
to
its
feet
and
starts
her
chase
xander
to
faith
get
in
faith
runs
to
the
car
and
dives
into
the
back
seat
xander
guns
it
just
as
the
demon
catches
up
but
she
can't
run
fast
enough
to
grab
hold
of
the
car
and
is
left
in
their
dust
cut
to
faith's
motel
xander
pulls
the
car
to
a
screeching
halt
in
a
parking
spot
they
both
run
out
and
up
the
stairs
to
her
room
watching
for
any
pursuers
faith
opens
the
door
and
runs
in
xander
is
right
behind
her
and
swings
the
door
shut
you
think
demon
mama
followed
us
he
checks
out
the
window
but
doesn't
see
anything
he
rushes
over
to
the
other
window
and
checks
there
too
but
again
sees
nothing
no
we're
cool
faith
takes
off
her
jacket
the
bitch
dislocated
my
shoulder
though
she
tosses
her
jacket
aside
careful
not
to
move
her
arm
too
much
xander
comes
back
over
to
her
hold
me
he
looks
at
her
a
bit
confused
but
gets
closer
and
reaches
out
to
her
faith
takes
his
right
hand
and
puts
it
on
her
left
upper
arm
he
finally
realizes
that
he's
supposed
to
hold
it
steady
she
reaches
up
with
her
right
hand
and
grabs
hold
of
his
jacket
for
leverage
she
pulls
her
left
shoulder
back
and
jerks
it
forward
her
shoulder
audibly
snaps
back
into
place
faith
heaves
a
sigh
and
rotates
her
shoulder
around
in
different
positions
that's
better
faith
sniffs
she
got
me
really
wound
up
she
looks
at
xander
and
runs
her
hand
over
his
chest
she
inhales
and
exhales
deeply
a
fight
like
that
and
no
kill
i'm
about
ready
to
pop
she
smiles
at
him
still
rubbing
her
hand
over
his
chest
xander
nervously
really
xander
looks
down
at
her
rubbing
hands
pop
faith
smiles
sexily
you
up
for
it
she
runs
her
other
hand
down
the
back
of
his
neck
xander
nods
oh
i'm
up
she
smiles
at
him
and
gets
closer
she
stops
rubbing
his
chest
and
lowers
her
hand
to
his
crotch
i'm
suddenly
very
up
it's
just
um
xander
grins
sheepishly
i've
never
been
up
with
people
before
faith
grabs
his
jaw
and
kisses
him
full
on
the
lips
with
plenty
of
tongue
just
relax
and
take
your
pants
off
she
starts
to
push
his
shirt
and
jacket
off
of
his
shoulders
those
two
concepts
are
antithetical
she
yanks
his
shirt
and
jacket
down
his
back
and
off
his
arms
and
throws
them
down
they
lock
in
a
passionate
embrace
and
kiss
each
other
hard
faith
turns
him
around
and
shoves
him
back
onto
the
bed
she
jumps
up
after
him
and
straddles
him
don't
worry
faith
pulls
off
her
own
shirt
i'll
steer
you
around
the
curves
she
grins
broadly
down
at
him
xander
looks
back
up
at
her
with
more
than
a
little
apprehension
on
his
face
did
i
mention
that
i'm
having
a
very
strange
night
cut
to
a
shot
of
their
reflection
in
the
tv
faith
is
on
top
of
xander
under
the
sheet
moving
slowly
and
purposefully
cut
to
them
cuddling
afterward
xander
runs
his
fingertips
across
her
upper
arm
they
gaze
into
each
other's
eyes
for
a
while
faith
smiles
at
him
cut
outside
her
motel
room
door
she
opens
it
and
nudges
xander
out
he
has
only
his
underwear
on
and
holds
the
rest
of
his
clothes
in
his
arms
faith
is
wrapped
up
in
the
bed
sheet
that
was
great
i
gotta
shower
she
closes
the
door
on
him
he
just
stands
there
unsure
of
what
just
happened
he
looks
at
the
door
again
and
soon
realizes
he's
just
been
used
mouth
agape
he
makes
his
way
back
to
his
car
cut
to
the
library
werewolf
oz
is
jumping
around
in
the
cage
very
agitated
willow
watches
him
very
worried
i've
never
seen
him
like
this
giles
comes
up
behind
her
with
the
dart
gun
and
hands
it
to
her
it's
the
hellmouth
he
can
sense
it's
going
to
open
be
ready
just
in
case
willow
checks
the
rifle
as
giles
goes
to
the
cage
to
open
it
he
looks
back
at
her
before
he
does
now
don't
hesitate
willow
raises
the
weapon
to
her
shoulder
and
takes
aim
anxious
about
having
to
hurt
oz
do
it
giles
unlocks
the
door
now
oz
oz
leaps
up
against
the
door
and
throws
it
open
knocking
giles
to
the
floor
he
takes
a
leap
toward
willow
but
she's
ready
and
pulls
the
trigger
the
dart
flies
from
the
barrel
and
hits
him
in
the
side
and
he
yelps
and
falls
to
the
floor
it's
not
enough
to
keep
him
down
in
his
agitated
state
though
and
he
gets
back
up
on
all
fours
behind
him
giles
scrambles
to
his
feet
again
willow
retreats
as
she
inserts
another
dart
into
the
gun
oz
is
weakened
but
he
lunges
toward
her
giles
runs
to
get
him
from
behind
oz
jumps
up
onto
the
table
just
as
giles
catches
up
and
grabs
him
around
the
chest
oz
raises
himself
up
on
his
hind
legs
growling
fiercely
as
giles
gets
an
arm
around
each
of
his
exposing
his
chest
willow
takes
the
shot
and
the
werewolf
yelps
again
this
time
the
phenobarbital
does
its
job
and
oz
collapses
onto
the
table
dragging
giles
down
on
top
of
him
the
wolf
pants
shallowly
as
willow
steps
up
to
him
and
soothingly
pets
the
thick
fur
on
his
head
we've
got
to
move
him
before
he
wakes
up
willow
remorsefully
to
oz
sorry
i
hope
you're
not
mad
at
me
in
the
morning
cut
to
faith's
motel
xander
pulls
on
his
jacket
and
gets
into
his
car
he
checks
himself
in
the
rearview
mirror
and
thinks
about
what
just
happened
he
sighs
and
looks
into
the
back
seat
there
he
sees
the
two
bags
of
stolen
ingredients
and
grabs
one
to
see
what's
inside
in
it
he
finds
a
can
of
kerosene
a
short
length
of
galvanized
pipe
with
caps
wire
primer
cord
and
an
electronic
timer
switch
he
takes
a
second
look
at
the
can
of
kerosene
and
realizes
that
the
cake
really
isn't
hey
they're
not
baking
any
cake
he
quickly
sets
the
can
aside
and
starts
the
car
cut
to
the
hardware
store
he
comes
to
a
stop
in
front
of
it
the
place
is
a
mess
but
jack
and
his
gang
are
nowhere
to
be
seen
long
gone
probably
loaded
with
supplies
gotta
think
he
looks
into
the
store
and
tries
to
concentrate
i
can't
believe

had
sex
xander
catches
himself

alreadydead

for
angel's
mansion

to
the
mansion

buffy
pleading

thing
buffy
protests

you
enough
time
for
willow's
spell
to
bind
it
she
stares
speechlessly
at
him
buffy
this
is
worse
than
anything
we've
ever
faced
it's
the
only
way
buffy
voice
cracking
i
can't
watch
you
die
again
he
lifts
his
hand
to
her
cheek
and
rubs
it
gently
looking
deeply
into
her
eyes
i
love
you
buffy
takes
his
hand
i
love
you
nothing
can
change
that
not
even
death
she
jerks
his
hand
away
and
steps
back
angry
about
his
defeatist
attitude
don't
talk
to
me
like
that
you
may
be
ready
to
go
but
i
am
not
ready
to
lose
you
okay

is
my
fight
and
if
you
won't
do
it
my
way

she
is
interrupted
by
xander
clearing
his
throat
she
turns
to
face
him
xander
grins
hey

got
this
um
there's
this
uh
xander
grins
sheepishly
buffy
and
angel
look
at
him
expectantly
xander
sees
the
sadness
in
their
faces
and
the
tear
streaks
on
buffy's
cheeks
xander
awkwardly
it's
probably
a
bad
time
he
turns
to
go
but
looks
back
at
them
again

i
help
they
both
shake
their
heads
at
him

walks
out

back
to

corner
and

and
laughing
okay

a
plan
jack
and
bob
hear
him
approaching
and
turn
around

up
and
xander
drives
up
between
them
slowing
down
as
if

right
up
by
the
car
so
xander
reaches
out
and

xander
hits
the
gas
and
takes
off
dragging
parker
alongside
cut
around

next
corner

okay

defuse
he
never
finishes
his
question
because
he
drives
too
close
to
a
curbside
mailbox
and
the
impact
knocks
parker's
head
off
xander
screams
in
horror
at
the
sight
and
releases
his
hold
on
parker's
now
headless
body
he
looks
back
at
the
others
and
guns
the
car
xander
chagrined
i

left
out
that
whole
middle
part
bob
and
dickie
keep
up
the
chase
jack
stops
to
check
on
parker
he's
headed
for
the
school
cut
to
a
hall
in
the
school
xander
barges
through
a
door
and
runs
past
the
basement
access
door
he
comes
back
to
it
and
notices
the
sign
stating
door
to
remain
locked
at
all
times
jack
bob
and
dickie
crash
through
the
hall
door
and
start
to
chase
him
there
he
is
xander
starts
to
run
down
the
hall
again
where's
a
slayer
when
you
need
one
cut
to
the
library
the
hellmouth
has
opened
and
the
same
huge
green
multiheaded
tentacled
demon
that
erupted
from
it
less
than
two
years
before
looms
over
the
heads
of
buffy
faith
angel
giles
and
willow
only
now
it's
much
larger
bolts
of
energy
flash
about
like
lightning
oh
my
god
it's
grown
the
camera
passes
through
the
group
to
the
doors
where
xander
runs
by
followed
a
moment
later
by
jack
and
then
bob
and
dickie
in
rapid
succession
dickie
is
distracted
by
the
noise
and
lights
coming
from
the
library
and
backtracks
to
have
a
look
he
peers
in
through
one
of
the
round
door
windows
and
sees
the
hellmouth
demon
waving
its
three
heads
around
wow
c'mon
man
dickie
joins
the
chase
again
cut
to
another
hall
the
dead
boys
have
lost
xander
they
open
a
set
of
doors
and
stop
at
the
hall
intersection
which
way
he
couldn't
have
gotten
far
let's
split
up
bob
goes
right
dickie
goes
left
and
jack
heads
straight
ahead
cut
to
the
stairs
by
the
student
lounge
bob
comes
bounding
down
and
stops
at
the
base
he
looks
around
and
notices
a
fire
ax
on
the
wall
he
smashes
the
glass
and
pulls
it
out
good
for
chopping
he
heads
into
the
student
lounge
a
moment
later
xander
runs
into
the
student
lounge
and
runs
up
to
the
couches
from
off
to
the
side
bob
swings
the
ax
at
him
xander
reacts
fast
and
stops
short
of
being
sliced
but
loses
his
balance
and
falls
backward
onto
a
table
he
rolls
off
of
it
and
onto
the
floor
quickly
he
scrambles
to
his
feet
but
immediately
gets
knocked
onto
another
table
by
a
punch
from
bob
now
this
is
what
i
call
fun
he
wields
the
ax
back
and
swings
it
down
at
the
table
xander
rolls
away
just
as
the
head
of
the
ax
embeds
itself
into
the
table
and
he
comes
up
standing
next
to
bob
he
backhand
punches
bob
in
the
face
stunning
him
grabs
him
and
swings
him
around
head
first
into
another
table
bob
falls
to
the
floor
and
lies
there
on
his
back
dazed
by
the
impact
xander
pulls
the
ax
from
the
other
table
looks
down
at
bob
and
goes
over
to
a
vending
machine
he
slips
the
blade
of
the
ax
behind
the
machine
and
uses
the
handle
as
a
lever
to
pry
it
away
from
the
wall
it
tilts
over
and
falls
right
onto
bob's
head
crushing
it
back
out
in
the
hall
dickie
comes
through
a
door
and
runs
into
the
student
lounge
he
sees
bob's
body
lying
there
and
stops
looking
at
it
aghast
xander
steps
out
into
the
open
holding
up
the
ax
should've
learned
by
now
if
you're
gonna
play
with
fire
you
gotta
expect
sooner
or
later
dickie
takes
off
running
before
xander
can
finish
delivering
his
clint
eastwood
line
xander
insulted
i
wasn't
finished
dickie
disappears
back
out
the
same
door
he
came
in
note
to
self
less
talk
he
starts
to
run
after
dickie
cut
to
the
hall
outside
the
library
doors
suddenly
the
doors
burst
open
and
buffy
comes
flying
out
backward
landing
almost
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
by
the
door
leading
outside
the
three
heads
of
the
hellmouth
demon
come
slithering
through
the
doors
after
her
buffy
gets
up
and
runs
back
at
it

for
the
heart
cut
to
another
part
of
the
hall
dickie
runs
around
a
corner
and
disappears
down
an
adjacent
hall
xander
is
right
behind
him
with
the
ax
a
moment
later
xander
comes
running
back
with
dickie
right
behind
him

on
their
heels
are
three
members
of
the
sisterhood
of
jhe

runs
into
a
room
and
off
to
the
side
dickie
follows
him
but
runs
through
it
to
the
nurse's
office
he
whips
the
door
open

in
and
finds
himself
trapped
the
demons
run
in
after
him
and
start
ripping
him
apart
xander
takes
a
few
deep
breaths
to
calm
himself
okay
boiler
room
he
turns
back
toward
the
door
but
is
stopped
by
one
of
the
heads
of
the
hellmouth
demon
when
it
breaks
through
the
wall
next
to
him
other
way
the
head
roars
after
him
as
he
runs
away
cut
to
the
basement
xander
kicks
open
the
door
enters
cautiously
and
makes
his
way
down
the
stairs
at
the
bottom
he
opens
the
door
to
the
boiler
room
and
looks
in
there
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
sees
the
bomb
the
timer
is
ticking
away
hello
nasty
he
steps
into
the
room
and
closes
the
door
behind
him
he
gingerly
goes
over
to
the
bomb
and
checks
the
timer
as
he
sets
down
the
ax
xander
breathing
hard
less
than
two
minutes
dumb
guy
little
bomb
how
hard
can
it
be
suddenly
jack
grabs
him
from
behind
and
throws
him
into
a
work
bench
he
hits
it
hard
and
falls
to
the
floor
xander
gets
back
up
only
to
find
himself
facetoface
with
jack
and
it
just
got
harder
i'm
not
leaving
till
that
thing's
disarmed
then
i
guess
you're
not
leaving
he
swings
a
right
at
xander
which
he
blocks
jack
swings
a
high
left
which
xander
ducks
jack
swings
a
right
again
and
this
time
hits
xander
in
the
jaw
making
him
stagger
back
into
a
wall
jack
pulls
katie
out
and
tries
to
stab
xander
but
he
catches
jack's
arm
and
manages
to
hold
him
back
jack
doesn't
let
up
though
and
keeps
pressing
into
him
xander
glances
over
at
the
bomb
which
is
ticking
away
jack
angrily
i'm
gonna
carve
you
up
and
serve
you
with
gravy
you
piss
me
off
boy
now
you
pay
the
price
first
the
eyes
then
the
tongue
i'm
gonna
break
every
one
of
your
fingers
you
gonna
do
all
that
in
fortynine
seconds
jack
looks
over
at
the
bomb
and
xander
seizes
the
opportunity
to
push
him
back
grab
him
by
the
jacket
and
shove
his
head
into
the
wall
he
pulls
him
back
from
the
wall
and
punches
him
in
the
face
jack
comes
back
up
unfazed
grabs
xander
by
the
pants
and
flips
him
over
onto
a
crate
he
quickly
gets
back
up
and
the
two
boys
start
to
come
at
each
other
again
but
then
stop
when
they
realize
they
don't
have
time
for
this
jack
glances
over
at
the
exit
sign
above
a
door
i
know
what
you're
thinkin'
can
i
get
by
him
get
up
the
stairs
out
of
the
building
seconds
ticking
away
i
don't
love
your
chances
then
you'll
die
too
xander
raises
his
eyebrows
yeah
looks
like
so
i
guess
the
question
really
is
who
has
less
fear
jack
tries
to
psyche
xander
out
i'm
not
afraid
to
die
i'm
already
dead
yeah
but
this
is
different
being
blowed
up
isn't
walking
around
and
drinking
with
your
buddies
dead
it's
little
bits
being
swept
up
by
a
janitor
dead
and
i
don't
think
you're
ready
for
that
he's
proven
right
when
jack
makes
a
move
for
the
door
xander
matches
his
move
and
jack
realizes
there's
no
way
he
can
get
out
they
face
each
other
from
opposite
sides
of
the
bomb
xander
is
oddly
calm
whereas
jack
is
clearly
afraid
are
you
xander
glances
at
the
bomb
smiles
thinly
i
like
the
quiet
cut
to
the
library
angel
and
faith
fight
one
of
the
sisterhood
she
swings
at
angel
but
he
ducks
the
punch
he
swings
at
her
and
hits
her
dead
in
the
face
giles
swings
at
the
hellmouth
demon
with
an
ax
still
trying
to
force
it
back
the
rest
of
the
way
as
he
recites
the
rest
of
the
binding
spell
omnia
vasa
veritatis
all
things
the
vessel
of
truth
now
buffy
from
above
him
at
the
stack
level
she
starts
to
swing
at
the
creature
with
a
battleaxe
cut
to
the
boiler
room
the
two
boys
are
still
facing
off
with
the
bomb
between
them
the
timer
counts
down
the
last
few
seconds

jack
caves
and
quickly
reaches
in
and
pulls
a
wire
the
timer
goes
blank
he
drops
the
wires
and
pulls
his
hands
away
it
takes
xander
a
moment
to
realize
that
it's
over
good
boy
he
steps
over
to
jack
and
looks
him
straight
in
the
eyes
i
don't
think
i
wanna
be
seeing
you
on
campus
anymore
jack
he
goes
over
to
the
door
he
entered
from
gives
jack
one
last
look
opens
it
and
leaves
closing
it
behind
him
jack
walks
toward
the
other
door
i'm
not
going
anywhere
harris
the
first
time
you
turn
your
back
he
pulls
the
door
open
and
werewolf
oz
jumps
out
at
him
jack
screams
as
he
hits
the
floor
and
gets
mauled
cut
to
the
school
the
next
day
students
come
and
go
as
though
nothing
has
happened
dissolve
to
the
quad
students
go
about
their
business
even
after
the
hellmouth
was
closed
you
could
still
hear
it
screaming
dissolve
to
her
buffy
giles
and
oz
sitting
at
a
lunch
table
they
all
sit
quietly
dissolve
to
a
closeup
of
giles
and
oz
but
angel's
gonna
be
okay
the
camera
pans
over
to
buffy
and
willow
buffy's
right
arm
is
in
a
sling
he
was
only
out
for
a
few
minutes
longest
of
my
life
willow
shakes
her
head
i
will
never
forget
that
thing's
face
its
real
face
i
mean

buffy
he
looks
up
at
her
it
was
the
bravest
thing
i've
ever
seen
giles
grins
stupidest
he
turns
his
face
revealing
several
nasty
scratches
across
his
left
cheek
ear
and
neck
but
the
world
continues
to
turn
no
one
will
ever
know
how
close
it
came
to
stopping
never
know
what
we
did

into

at

doesn't
have
a
clue
what
he
smiles
more
broadly
and
just
walks

her
cordelia
unnerved
what

just
keeps
walking
away
never
looking
back
cordelia
insistently
