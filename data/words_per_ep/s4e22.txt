of
you

sitting
there
waiting
to
be
shepherded
xander
looks
confused
alarmed
i
remember
it
smelled
like
dead
flowers
like
decay
then
it
hit
me
the
hope
of
our
nation's
future
is
a
bunch
of
mulch
you
know
i
never
got
the
chance
to
tell
you
how
glad
i
was
you
were
eaten
by
a
snake
xander
suddenly
gets
an
i

is
all
sweaty

hands
lifting

over
his
bald
head

is
illuminated
snyder
contemptuous
you're

a
whipping
boy
raised
by
mongrels
and
set
on
a
sacrificial
stone
xander
nods
i'm
getting
a
cramp
he
stands

around

corner

the
same
darkhaired

crawling
or
crouching
behind
a
trellis

courtyard
outside

apartment
he
runs
to
giles'
door
opens
it
enters
giles

here
it's
more
serious
than
we
thought
giles
and
buffy
and
anya
looking
at
willow
who's
in
a
chair
still
gasping
and
choking
they
all
ignore
xander

what
sounds
like
helicopter
noises
giles
i
can
fight
anything
right
maybe
we
should
slap
her
xander
runs
past
them
down
the
hall
that
should
lead
to
giles'
kitchen
but
instead
he
comes
out
in
buffy's
dorm
students
walking
around
chattering
harsh
jangly
rock
music
with
the
helicopter
noise
as
the
percussion
xander
goes
through
the
hallways
and
into
buffy
and
willow's
room
buffy
hears
growling
behind
him
he
yanks
open
the
closet
door
and
goes
in
fights
his
way
past
the
clothes
and
is
in
a
dark
room
horizontalstriped
light
like
it's
coming
through
venetian
blinds
he
runs
through
dark
bricklined
hall
comes
out
in
his
basement
again
stops
looks
around
the
music
slowly
fades
out
there's
still
pounding
on
the
upstairs
door
and
the
knob
rattling
he
goes
toward
it
up
a
couple
of
stairs
shaking
his
head
xander
whispers
that's
not
the
way
out
the
door
bursts
open
xander
looks
down
at
himself
then
back
up
the
stairs
what
the
hell
is
wrong
with
you
xander
looks
chastised
a
man
silhouetted
in
the
doorway
above
it's
xander's
dad
you
won't
come
upstairs
what
are
you
ashamed
of
us
your
mother's
crying
her
guts
out
you
don't
understand
no
you
don't
understand
dad
starts
down
the
stairs
stomping
angrily
the
line
ends
here
with
us
and
you're
not
gonna
change
that
xander
looking
down
unable
to
look
at
his
dad
you
haven't
got
the
heart
suddenly
dad
shoves
his
hand
into
xander's
chest
xander
looks
down
the
hand
is
covered
with
rags
he
looks
up
scared
brief
glimpse
of
a
pair
of
feral
eyes
surrounded
by
dark
stringy
hair
grey
skin
the
person
growls
the
hand
pulls
xander's
heart
out
of
his
chest
cut
to
the
real
xander
writhing
and
gasping
in
his
sleep
on
the
floor

watch
on
a
chain
swinging
back
and
forth
in

of
a
chest
wearing
giles'
tweedy
conservative
clothes
you
have
to
stop
thinking
fade
to
buffy's
face
looking
pleased
the
reflection
of
the
watch
moves
across
her
face
let
it
wash
over
you
don't
you
think
it's
a
little
oldfashioned
this
is
the
way
women
and
men
have
behaved
since
the
beginning
giles'
apartment
with
no
furniture
except
one
chair
which
buffy
is
sitting
on
giles
stands
in

with
the
pocket

look
into

bursts
out
laughing
cut
to
a
park
at
night
a
hedge
cut
into
the
shape
of
an
elephant
covered
with
christmaslights

the
fable
about

buffy
pulls
them
through
crowds
of
people
carnival
booths
colorful
lights
which
one
is
that
the
the
one
about

climbing
up
some

surgeon
general
shot

buffy
looking
surprised

it's
what

she's
uncomfortable
with
certain
concepts
adam
wearing
a
suit
too
with
no

it's
understandable
aggression
is
a
natural
human
tendency
adam
looks
at
buffy
though
you
and
me
come
by
it
another
way
shot
of

adam
shakes
his
head
suddenly
the
lighting
turns
blue
not
a
man
among
us
can
remember
buffy
looks
around
at
the
blue
lighting
in
the
background
shadows
are
moving
noises
like
emergency
doors
slamming
shut
the
demons
have
escaped

adam
nodding
i'll
get
some

adam
leaves
buffy
looks
very
nervous
shadowy
figures
behind
her
seem
to
be
moving
closer
she
looks
down
and
sees
her
weapons
bag
lying
at
her
feet
looks
up
buffy
gasping
anxiously
wait
i
have
weapons
she
sits
on
the
floor
and
opens
the
bag
it's
full
of
mud
buffy
frowns
putting
her
hands
in
the
mud
and
moving
them
around
lifts
her
hands
covered
in
mud
brings
them
up
and
smears
the
mud
on
her
face
reaches
in
for
more
rubs
it
all
over
her
face
as
the
colors
invert
again
like
a
photonegative
suddenly
the
color
returns
to
normal
and
buffy
looks
up
with
her
i'm
gonna
kick
your
ass
expression
riley
offscreen
thought
you
were
looking
for
your
friends
okay
killer
shot

the
way
you
want
it
i
guess
you're
on
your
own
riley
walks
off
buffy's
still
on
the
floor
in
the
gray
room
surrounded
by
blue
light
suddenly
a
beam
of
sunshine
lights
her
she
gets
up
and
walks
off
fade
to
buffy's
feet
walking
along
a
hallway
which
turns
to
rippled
sand
like
on
a
beach
she
walks
past
a
palm
tree
and
is
in
the
desert
from
before
rocks
scraggly
bushes
sand
again
the
woman
is
humming
buffy
walks
down
a
hill
the
camera
zooms
out
to
see
more
of
the
same
landscape
with
mountains
in
the
distance
a
breeze
ruffles
her
hair
and
dress
i'm
never
gonna
find
them
here
she
looks
up
and
sees
tara
far
off
walking
toward
her
tara
has
her
hair
up
wears
a
long
pink
skirt
and
matching
top
that
exposes
a
lot
of
her
stomach
of
course
not
that's
the
reason
you
came
tara
fades
out
and
reappears
closer
then
this
repeats
she
stops
walking
shot
of
buffy
and
tara
standing
about
thirty
feet
apart
facing
each
other
with
miles
of
desert
stretching
out
behind
them
you're
not
in
my
dream
i
was
borrowed
shot
of
tara
standing
with
big
rocks
behind
her
she
wears
a
gold
necklace
someone
has
to
speak
for
her
shot

buffy
standing
with
rocks
bushes
and
mountains
behind
let
her
speak
for
herself
the
darkhaired
creature
walking
up
behind
her
that's
what's
done
in
polite
circles
the
creature
moves
around
to
in
front
of
buffy
and
finally
get
a
good
look
at
her
it's
a
darkskinned
woman
with
dreadlocks
and
long
sharp
fingernails
her
face
is
painted
with
white
or
grayish
paint
lines
of
black
paint
across
her
eyes
and
she
wears
rags

in
between

and
the
first
slayer
holding
up
two
slices
of
cheese
he
grins
and
shakes
the
cheese
at

and
they
roll
down

sandy
hill
clutching

and
rolling
over
and
over
as
the
drums
continue
enough
cut
to
buffy
waking
up
on
joyce's
floor
she
lifts
her
head
and
looks
around
pan
across
giles
willow
and
xander
sleeping
in
their
spots
buffy
groans
and
starts
to
get
up
growl
the
first
slayer
lands
atop
buffy
and
starts
stabbing
repeatedly
at
the
floor
with
her
stake
shot
of
buffy
lying
underneath
the
first
slayer
rolling
her
eyes
are
you
quite
finished
first
slayer
pulls
her
stake
out
of
the
floor
it's
over
okay
i'm
going
to
ignore
you
and
you're
going
to
go
away
the
first
slayer
pulls
back
and
buffy
sits
up
then
stands
you're
really
gonna
have
to
get
over
the
whole
primal
power
thing
buffy
walks
toward
the
sofa
shot
of
the
first
slayer
staring
at
her
buffy
over
her
shoulder
you're
not
the
source
of
me
she
picks
up
her
blanket
and
sits
back
down
on
the
sofa
next
to
willow
another
shot
of
the
first
slayer
staring
at
her
also
in
terms
of
hair
care
you
really
wanna
say
what
kind
of
impression
am
i
making
in
the
workplace
'cause
cut
to
the
real
buffy
waking
up
on
the
sofa
the
cut
on
her
forehead
is
back
she
looks
around
shot
of
all
four
of
them
giles
willow
and
xander
awake
at
the
same
instant
they
all
sit
up
and
look
at
each
other
fade
to
the
four
of
them
sitting
around
the
kitchen
table
the
first
slayer
wow
not
big
with
the
socialization
or
the
floss
somehow
our
joining
with
buffy
and
invoking
the
essence
of
the
the
slayer's
power
was
an
affront
to
the
source
of
that
power
you
know
you
could
have
brought
that
up
to
us
before
we
did
it
i
did
i
said
there
could
be
dire
consequences
yes
but
you
say
that
about
chewing
too
fast
joyce
enters
wearing
a
bathrobe
i'm
uh
guessing
i
missed
some
fun

spirit
of
the
first
slayer

to
kill
us
in
our
dreams

up
in
surprise

offscreen

down
the
hall
toward
the
bathroom

into
the
doorway
looking
at
her
bed

know
what's
to
come

haven't
even
begun
long
shot
of
the
darkened
bedroom
with
buffy
framed
in
the
doorway
she
slowly
backs
away
turns
and
walks
out
of
sight
