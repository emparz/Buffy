willow
tara
and
anya
lounging
on
beach
blankets
while
xander
is
sitting
by
a
fire
pit
trying
to
light
it
in
the
background
we
can
see
buffy
and
riley
and
beyond
them
the
ocean
riley
is
getting
up
and
running
at
buffy
no
don't
no

buffy
shrieks
as
riley
tackles
her
i'm
exhausted
just
looking
at
those
two
all
the
splashing
and
jumping
and
running
shouldn't
relaxing
involve
less
exertion
absolutely
exertion
can
lead
to
sweatiness
which
can
cause
the
pain
and
heartbreak
of
stinkiness
better
to
just
stay
put
i
think
we've
just
put
our
finger
on
why
we're
the
sidekicks
buffy
and
riley
approach
game
over
uh
buffy
slayed
the
football
riley
holds
up
the
deflated
ball

tosses
it
aside

still
trying
to
light
the
fire
yeah
man
i'm
starving
cow
me
riley
he
and
buffy

culinary
finesse
of
a
caveman

a
life
giles
sits
down

not

left
the
house
willow
um
you
mustn't
repeat
what
i'm
about
to
say
especially
not
to
buffy
giles
willow
looks
confused
and
concerned

guess
now
that
i
know
there's
something

just
because
i'm
afraid
somebody'll
know
i
know

you
can't
you're
buffy's
watcher
giles
sighs
i
mean
in
a
fired
way
but
well
it's
become
quite
obvious
that
buffy
doesn't
need
me
ii
don't
say
that
in
a
selfpitying
way
i'm
i'm
quite
proud
actually
giles
smiles
gently
but
what
about
the
rest
of
us
we
still
need
to
be
watched
personally
i
can't
get
through
a
day
without
a
little
hairy
eyeball
giles
laughs
softly
i
appreciate
the
sentiment
but
it's
it's
just
not
so

be
fine

all
will
giles

joyce
nods

sorry
buffy
kisses
joyce
on
cheek
duty

a
total
drag
buffy
leaves
cut
to
buffy
punching
a
vampire
in
the
cemetery
looking
like
she's
having
plenty
of
fun
she
punches
him
several
times
and
then
grabs
his
shoulders
and
knees
him
he
gets
up
and
she's
on
his
back
shot
of
a
bunch
of
smoke
or
fog
coalescing
into
a
face
we
see
just
a
pair
of
eyes
and
a
nose
back
to
buffy
on
top
of
the
vampire
he
throws
her
down
she
gets
up
and
charges
ducks
a
punch
punches
and
then
kicks
him
she
tries
to
kick
again
but
he
grabs
her
and
lifts
her
over
his
head
then
throws
her
down
she
gets
up
again
jumps
on
him
with
her
legs
around
his
neck
he
throws
her
down
she
flips
him
over
and
then
stakes
him
buffy
stands
up
looking
satisfied
begins
to
stride
away
purposefully
she
walks
between
the
gravestones
and
suddenly
stops
whirls
around
very
impressive
hunt
we
see
a
man
walking
forward
out
of
the
darkness
he's
very
thin
and
pale
has
long
hair
and
speaks
with
an
accent
such
power
that
was
no
hunt
that
was
just
another
day
on
the
job
we
see
that
the
man
is
wearing
a
long
flowing
cloak
and
has
long
flowing
hair
he
walks
toward
buffy
care
to
step
up
for
some
overtime
we're
not
going
to
fight
do
you
know
what
a
slayer
is
do
you
man
smirking
buffy
looks
intrigued
who
are
you
i
apologize
i
assumed
you
knew
i
am
dracula
buffy's
eyes
widen
and
she
looks
delighted
get
out
act
ii

fade
in
on
willow
and
xander
walking
through
the
darkened
graveyard
holding
plastic
cups
of
iced
coffee
xand
what
if
somebody
had
a
secret
and
that
somebody
promised
somebody
else
that
they
wouldn't
tell
anyone
xander
nodding
news
flash
will
everybody
knows
no
thithis
isn't
about
me
and
tara
oh
well
not
that
i
wouldn't
be
all
ears
if
you
wanted
to
tell
me
a
secret
about
you
two
even
if
it
was
very
very
naughty
willow
grins
sorry
this
is
of
the
nonnaughty
variety
and
i'm
not
telling
you
willow
nods
firmly
okay
want
to
see
if
buffy's
hanging
around
the
headstones
sure
so
if
i
was
gonna
tell
you
which
i'm
not
going
to
cut
to
buffy
still
looking
amazed
so
lemme
get
this
straight
you're

buffy
in
dracula's
accent
dracula
the
guy
the
count
i
am
dracula
we
can
see
his
fangs
now
and
you're
sure
this
isn't
just
some
fanboy
thing
cause
i've
fought
more
than
a
couple
of
pimply
overweight
vamps
that
called
themselves
lestat
dracula
looks
a
little
annoyed
you
know
who
i
am
as
i
would
now
without
question
that
you
are
buffy
summers
dracula
walks
toward
her
looming
over
her
you're
heard
of
me
naturally
you're
known
throughout
the
world
buffy
smiles
bashfully
naw
really
why
else
would
i
come
here
for
the
sun
i
came
to
meet
the
renowned
killer
yeah
i
prefer
the
term
slayer
you
know
killer
just
sounds
so
naked
like
i
paint
clowns
or
something
i'm
the
good
guy
remember
perhaps
but
your
power
is
rooted
in
darkness
you
must
feel
it
buffy
frowns
and
ponders
this
for
a
moment
no
you
know
what
i
feel
bored
she
lunges
at
him
with
her
stake
he
dissolves
into
smoke
as
she
straightens
up
looking
confused
he
reappears
behind
her
she
turns
lunges
again
he
dissolves
into
smoke
again
buffy
looks
around
okay
that's
cheating
xander
and
willow
walk
up
hey
buff
what's
up
you
look
like
you
just
get
out
of
here
now
fine
but
i
was
gonna
give
you
a
sip
of
my
doublemint
mocha
but
xander
we
see
dracula
reappearing
behind
him
behind
you
willow
and
xander
turn
and
see
dracula
hi
nice
look
who's
got
a
bad
case
of
dark
prince
envy
xander
behind
him
we
see
buffy
holding
her
stake
looking
concerned
i
have
no
interest
in
you
leave
us
no
we're
not
going
to
xander
in
dracula's
accent
leave
you
and
where'd
you
get
that
accent
sesame
street
xander
as
the
count
on
sesame
street
vun
two
three
three
victims
mwa
ha
ha
dracula
looks
annoyed
buffy
whispering
xander
i'm
pretty
sure
that's
dracula
wow
really
xander
hurries
to
stand
behind
buffy
hey
sorry
man
i
was
just
jokin'
around
this
is
not
the
time
dracula
locks
eyes
with
buffy
i
will
see
you
soon
he
spreads
his
cape
out
and
moves
toward
them
turning
into
a
bat
and
flying
over
their
heads
as
they
all
duck
and
yell
the
bat
flies
away
squeaking
they
straighten
up
and
look
around
the
bat
comes
back
and
flies
around
buffy's
head
she
covers
her
head
with
her
hands
bat
ooh
bat
the
bat
squeaks
and
flies
away
again
cut
to
exterior
shot
of
giles'
building
and
then
buffy's
all
look
out
cut
to
inside
giles'
apartment
and
then
frigging
dracula's
standing
right
behind
us
xander
sits
on
sofa
where
anya
and
willow
are
already
sitting
we
see
buffy
and
riley
standing
around
and
then
he
lunges
at
us
like
whoosh
willow
with
hand
gestures
he
totally
looked
shorter
in
person
i
told
you
he'd
heard
of
me
right
i
mean
can
you
believe
that
buffy
shot
of
giles
nodding
patiently
count
famous
heard
of
me
i
couldn't
believe
it
the
first
twenty
times
you
told
us
but
it's
starting
to
sink
in
now
i'm
sorry
am
i
repeatogirl
i
was
just
blown
away
it's
not
that
surprising
that
he's
heard
of
you
buffy
you
are
the
slayer
i
guess
just
the
way
he
said
it
you
know
i
mean
he
made
it
sound
so
sexy
i
bet
he
made
it
sound
sexy
willow
grinning
we
see
tara
coming
up
behind
her
kinda
he
of
the
dark
penetrating
eyes
and
lilty
accent
buffy
sits
i
wonder
if
he
knows
frankenstein
tara
sits
on
arm
of
couch
and
gives
willow
a
glass
of
soda
you
thought
dracula
was
sexy
oh
no
he
he
was
yuck
right
except
for
the
whole
tall
dark
and
handsome
thing
yucko
how
would
you
know
well
we
hung
out
a
few
times
anya
xander
looks
jealous
back
in
my
demon
days
you
know
once
or
twice
he's
pretty
cool
anya
sighs
wistfully
then
remembers
herself
you
know
from
from
a
whole
evil
thing
perspective
xander
scoffs
please
he
was
no
big
whoop
no
big
whoop
what
about
that
thing
where
he
turned
himself
into
a
bat
that
was
awesome
it
must
have
been
yes
giles
everyone
looks
at
him
i
must
admit
i'm
sorry
i
missed
that
willow
suddenly
realizing
me
too
the
whole
time
i
was
thinking
'gosh
i
wish
giles
were
here
he'd
know
what
to
do'
giles
smiles
tolerantly
he
knows
what
she's
trying
to
do
willow
to
the
others
didn't
you
guys
think
that
actually
i
was
more
thinking
'bat'
buffy
wiggles
hands
near
her
head
xander
to
giles
how
come
he
can
do
that
i
i
have
no
idea
there's
a
great
deal
of
myth
about
dracula
i
imagine
the
trick
to
defeating
him
lies
in
separating
the
fact
from
the
fiction
great
point
that
is
so
giles
to
think
of
something
like
that
you
know
willow
to
the
others
that
that
we
would
have
never
willow
trails
off
so
we
should
take
things
slow
with
dracula
i
mean
he
said
that
we
would
meet
again
but
i
would
like
to
avoid
that
until
we
do
some
serious
homework
i
don't
know
i
mean
he
may
have
a
bunch
of
swell
party
tricks
but
he's
still
just
a
vampire
i
say
we
load
up
with
stakes
and
crossbows
and
go
after
him
now
second
no
buffy's
right
dracula's
too
slick
to
fall
for
the
usual
stuff
so
we
hold
off
no
killing
until
we
know
exactly
what
we're
dealing
with
you're
not
just
saying
that
because
of
those
dark
penetrating
eyes
of
his
are
you
noooo
his
eyes
were

buffy
gets
up
and
goes
over
to
riley
there
were
there
was
no
penetration
buffy
embarrassed
cross
my
heart
all
right
willow
you
and
tara
find
out
everything
you
can
about
the
actual
legend
of
vlad
the
impaler
on
the
internet
giles
willow
and
tara
nod
and
uh
i'll
check
the
library
giles
everyone
starts
to
get
up
if
the
initiative
was
still
around
we'd
be
able
to
find
everything
on
this
guy
in
a
few
hours
we
might
not
be
as
fast
but
we'll
find
him
you
guys
we'll
reconvene
here
in
the
morning
everyone
says
uhhuh
and
goes
off
riley
pulls
buffy
aside
what's
your
plan
big
sleep
my
count
encounter
wiped
me
out
riley
nods
i'm
kinda
wired
maybe
i
should
just
let
you
get
your
rest
you
sure
i
mean
maybe
if
you
just

down
with
me
buffy
suggestive
look
riley
grinning
nothing

are
about
to
say

little
sugar

dracula
schmacula
cut
to
anya
and
xander
walking
down
the
street
i
doubt
he'd
remember
me
i
was
just
a
silly
young
thing
i
mean
like
seven
hundred
or
so
but
he
did
say
that
this
guy
i
cursed
was
doomed
forever
which
was
really
sweet
don't
you
think
adorable
it
was
a
great
spell
i
made
this
jerk
incredibly
fat
like
a
human
minivan
the
camera
pans
up
to
the
rooftop
of
the
espresso
pump
where
we
see
a
wolf
growling
as
it
walks
along
the
roof
following
anya
and
xander
you
should
just
mention
my
name
if
you
see
him
again
or
better
yet
why
don't
you
just
go
sit
on
top
of
a
crypt
and
flaunt
your
neck
cleavage
until
dracula
shows
up
then
you
two
can
talk
private
oh
please
don't
tell
me
you're
jealous
oh
no
just
because
you're
panting
over
the
guy
xander
stops
walking
i
am
not
panting
now
stop
being
silly
i'll
see
you
tomorrow
anya
smooch
you
don't
wanna
come
back
to
my
place
it's
whites
day
remember
the
bleach
smell
makes
me
nauseous
anya
walks
off
fine
i
suppose
dracula
doesn't
use
bleach
huh
he's
a
darksonly
man
xander
walks
off
we
see
the
wolf
still
watching
him
cut
to
xander
rounding
a
corner
on
the
dark
street
he
jumps
in
shock
when
he
sees
dracula
waiting
for
him
xander
sighing
great
perfect
xander
suddenly
deciding
he's
not
scared
you
know
what
you're
not
so
big
xander
looks
dracula
up
and
down
one
round
of
oldfashioned
fisticuffs
you'd
fold
like
a
bitty
baby
dracula
scowls
xander
rolls
up
sleeves
okay
let's
do
it
and
no
poofing
come
on
puffy
shirt
pucker
on
up
'cause
you
can
kiss
your
pale
ass
silence
yes
master
xander
shakes
head
no
that's
not
dracula
lifts
a
hand
you
will
be
my
emissary
my
eyes
and
ears
in
daylight
your
emissary
serve
me
well
you
will
be
rewarded
i
will
make
you
an
immortal
a
child
of
darkness
that
feeds
on
life
itself
on
blood
xander
in
dracula's
accent
blood
xander
speaking
very
quickly
yes
yes
i
will
serve
you
your
excellent
spookiness
dracula
frowns
xander
still
speaking
too
quickly
or
master
i'll
just
stick
with
master
you
are
strange
and
offputting
go
now
xander
nods
turns
to
go
turns
back
but
master
how
can
i
find
xander
sees
dracula
is
gone
brilliant
what
an
exit
guy's
a
genius
xander
giggles
crazily
and
walks
off
cut
to
riley
opening
a
crypt
door
and
walking
in
candles
are
lit
everywhere
he
walks
in
looking
around
well
well
spike
emerges
from
the
shadows
holding
a
crossbow
you
can
take
the
boy
out
of
the
initiative
but
you
can't
take
the
initiative
out
of
the
boy
i'd
put
that
down
unless
you're
bucking
for
one
hell
of
a
headache
spike
hesitates
puts
the
bow
down
i
can't
be
too
careful
i
got
quite
a
few
demons
after
me
these
days
i'm
looking
for
some
information
might
pay
a
little
spike
shrugs
i'll
play
spike
goes
over
to
a
couple
of
chairs
what
can
you
tell
me
about
dracula
dracula
spike
scoffs
poncy
bugger
owes
me
eleven
pounds
for
one
thing
spike
puts
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
you
know
him
know
him
we're
old
rivals
spike
lights
cigarette
but
then
he
got
famous
forgot
all
about
his
foes
spike
points
at
riley
i'll
tell
you
what
that
glory
hound's
done
more
harm
to
vampires
than
any
slayer
his
story
gets
out
and
suddenly
everybody
knows
how
to
kill
us
spike
sits
down
you
know
the
mirror
bit
but
he's
not
just
a
regular
vampire
i
mean
he
has
special
powers
right
nothing
but
showy
gypsy
stuff
what's
it
to
you
anyway
he's
in
town
making
his
presence
known
spike
smiling
drac's
in
sunnydaleway
spike
puts
feet
up
on
a
cassock
i
guess
the
old
boy
needed
closure
after
all
actually
he's
gunning
for
buffy
but
i'm
out
to
find
him
before
he
gets
another
shot
at
her
riley
sits
tough
talk
cowboy
but
you're
not
gonna
catch
him
napping
in
a
crypt
no
the
count
has
to
have
his
luxury
estate
and
his
bugeaters
and
his
special
dirt
don't
he
so
you're
saying
i
should
check
out
mansions
that
sort
of
thing
no
spike
stands
i'm
saying
you
should
go
home
to
your
superhoney
have
a
nice
safe
snog
you're
out
of
your
depth
on
this
one
boy
spike
turns
his
back
on
riley
you've
helped
buffy
before
so
she
has
a
problem
with
killing
you
now
that
you're
helpless
riley
spike
still
turned
away
i
don't
spike
turns
to
face
him
walks
up
to
him
i'd
like
to
see
you
try
riley
stands
gets
in
spike's
face
would
you
they
stare
each
other
down
finally
spike
looks
away
pfft
riley
walks
to
the
door
spike
calls
out
as
riley
is
at
the
door
you're
never
gonna
find
him
riley
leaves
spike
to
himself

to
her
cut

shot
of
joyce's
house
night
cut
to
buffy
in
bed
asleep
pan
over
to
the
window
fog
pours
in
from
outside
flows
across
the
floor
toward
the
bed
a
breeze
comes
up
ruffling
the
sheets
buffy
wakes
and
sits
up
with
a
gasp
dracula
stands
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
you
are
magnificent
i
bet
you
say
that
before
you
bite
all
the
girls
no
you
are
different
kindred
kindred
hardly
i
pull
your
hair
back
buffy
looks
surprised
but
pulls
her
hair
back
from
her
neck
shot
of
dracula
admiring
her
this
isn't
how
i
usually
fight
buffy
looks
a
little
selfconscious
glances
at
the
window
you
think
you
can
just
waft
in
here
with
your
music
video
wind
and
your
hypnoeyes
buffy
trails
off
i
have
searched
the
world
over
for
you
i
have
yearned
for
you
dracula
sits
on
the
bed
next
to
her
for
a
creature
whose
darkness
rivals
my
own
he
puts
his
hand
on
her
chin
and
moves
her
head
aside
he
sees
the
scar
where
angel
bit
her
episode
graduation
day
and
touches
it
with
his
fingertips
you
have
been
tasted
dracula
smiles
slightly
as
he
trails
his
fingers
over
her
cheek
he
was
unworthy
dracula
buffy
stares
at
him
looks
scared
he
let
you
go
dracula
looks
her
in
the
eyes
but
the
embrace
his
bite
you
remember
buffy
uncertain
no
dracula
caresses
her
face
some
more
do
not
fight
dracula
puts
his
hand
behind
her
neck
i
can
feel
your
hunger
he
leans
down
to
bite
her
neck
buffy
gasps
but
doesn't
pull
away
act
iii

fade
in
on
exterior
of
joyce's
house
morning
cut
to
buffy
asleep
in
bed
she
wakes
up
sits
up
looking
a
little
confused
cut
to
buffy
dressed
looking
in
the
mirror
she
fiddles
with
her
hair
notices
something
pulls
her
hair
back
to
expose
two
bite
marks
on
her
neck
she
looks
at
it
for
a
moment
then
grabs
a
scarf
and
ties
it
around
her
neck
cut
to
riley
leaning
over
with
a
donut
here's
a
jelly
one
you
want
it
closeup
of
riley's
hand
holding
the
donut
out
shot
of
buffy
on
giles'
couch
with
the
donut
being
held
in
her
face
no
got
it
got
it
mine
mine
xander
note
throughout
this
scene
xander
speaks
each
line
very
quickly
and
moves
around
a
lot
xander
rushes
out
of
the
kitchen
and
grabs
the
donut
we
see
giles
in
the
kitchen
xander
walks
in
little
circles
nibbling
quickly
at
the
donut
riley
looks
in
the
box
for
another
donut
we
see
willow
on
a
chair
in
the
background
well
i
think
we
have
dracula
factoids
xander
sitting
on
a
stool
eating
the
donut
like
any
of
that's
enough
to
fight
the
dark
master
everyone
gives
him
a
strange
look
bator
a
lot
of
it
we
already
knew
willow
riley
walks
to
another
chair
opposite
the
couch
turnoffs
wood
fire
crosses
garlic
turnons
nice
duds
minions
willow
wistful
long
slow
bites
that
last
for
days
yeah
i
did
a
little
research
too
riley
shot
of
buffy
looking
distracted
dracula
likes
to
live
in
style
which
means
we
can
rule
out
the
usual
dumps
vampires
haunt
ah
but
he's
smart
enough
to
figure
that
we
probably
already
know
that
i'm
guessing
he's
lying
low
xander
licks
his
donut
giles
comes
out
from
the
kitchen
actually
my
research
backs
riley
up
drac
isn't
the
laylow
type
giles
gives
riley
a
glass
of
milk
so
we
can
uh
check
out
the
nicer
places
don't
you
think
buffy
buffy
isn't
paying
attention
we
see
xander
moving
from
chair
to
chair
and
tapping
fingers
nervously
buffy
buffy
blinks
tunes
back
in
yeah
we'll
check
all
the
swanky
places
first
what
else
did
you
guys
get
well
willow
has
most
of
it
actually
willow
sits
up
only
because
you
gave
me
super
pointers
i
never
would
have
giles
puts
up
hand
to
stop
her
just
go
ahead
willow
ok
dracula's
modus
operandi
is
different
from
other
vampires
he
will
kill
just
to
feed
but
he'd
rather
have
a
connection
with
his
victims
and
he
has
all
of
these
mental
powers
to
draw
them
in
buffy
looks
thoughtful
he
he
can
read
and
control
minds
appear
in
dreams
buffy
distracted
uh
huh
makes
sense
that
stare
he
just
kinda
looked
right
through
you
didn't
you
feel
it
buffy
riley
looks
at
buffy
buffy
pause
no
buffy
gets
up
no
i
didn't
see
buffy
didn't
feel
it
i
think
you're
drawing
a
low
of
crazy
conclusions
about
the
unholy
prince
everyone
gives
him
a
strange
look
bator
the
point
is
though
he
goes
through
the
motions
of
an
intimate
seduction
the
end
result
is
the
same
he
turns
them
into
a
vampire
buffy
looks
as
if
she
hadn't
considered
that
well
that
is
intimate
dracula's
gifting
these
ladies
with
his
own
blood
and
blood

xander
he
notices
a
spider
on
the
desk
next
to
him
glances
around
to
see
if
anyone's
looking
blood
is
life
everyone
looks
confused
according
to
them
xander
slams
his
hand
down
on
the
spider
um
just
be
aware
that
he
he
tends
to
form
a
relationship
with
his
prey
giles
when
no
one's
looking
xander
scoops
the
spider
into
his
mouth
and
chews
it's
not
enough
for
him
to
take
her
she
must
want
to
be
taken
she
must
burn
for
him
giles
buffy
looks
uncomfortable
fiddling
with
her
scarf
that's
interesting
i'm
gonna
go
find
him
she
starts
to
leave
everyone
gets
up
you
shouldn't
go
by
yourself
buffy
i
mean
this
guy's
seriously
dangerous
it's
cool
i
got
it
buffy
opens
door
leaves
buffy
walking
through
the
courtyard
outside
giles'
apartment
riley
comes
out
after
her
hey
riley
grabs
her
arm
and
stops
her
take
off
that
scarf
what
no
buffy
puts
hand
over
scarf
riley
gives
an
i
knew
it
nod
you're
under
the
thrall
of
the
dark
prince
buffy
scoffs
i
am
not
under
the
thrall
of
the
dark
prince
then
take
off
the
scarf
oh
let
go
of
me
this
is
ridiculous
buffy
tries
to
break
arm
out
of
riley's
grasp
but
he
holds
on
riley
rips
off
the
scarf
as
the
others
come
out
too
everyone
looks
at
buffy's
neck
she
sits
on
the
edge
of
the
stone
fountain
and
puts
her
head
in
her
hands
why
didn't
you
say
anything
'cause
she
didn't
want
to
worry
us
right
buffster
it's
nothin'
just
a
scratch
two
deep
puncturey
scratches
buffy
looks
apologetically
at
riley
i'm
not
sure
why
i
tried
to
hide
it
uh
there
was
just
this
voice
and
it
was
it
was
telling
me
to
cover
it
and
what
did
i
tell
you
riley
to
the
others
that's
thrall
you're
saying
dracula
has
some
sort
of
freaky
mind
control
over
her
you're
watching
too
many
creature
features
man
but
it
does
seem
like
he
has
this
control
over
me
i
even
though
a
big
part
of
me
is
resisting
during
this
speech
we
see
xander
grab
a
fly
off
a
nearby
leaf
and
eat
it
no
that's
okay
i
shouldn't
take
this
personally
i
mean
what
with
angel
i
mean
it's
understandable
that
there
would
be
transference
i
mean
they're
both
broody
immortals
buffy
looks
dismayed
and
gets
up
to
walk
close
to
riley
buffy
firmly
i
am
not
transfery
buffy
quieter
i
swear
to
you
i'm
your
girl
and
i'm
gonna
stay
that
way
okay
but
you
are
not
going
anywhere
near
him
again
uh
riley's
right
you
should
you
should
stay
out
of
sight
let
the
rest
of
us
look
for
dracula
i
can't
go
home
he
already
got
inside
once
you
can
come
over
to
my
place
i'll
make
sure
you
stay
put
good
um
riley
and
i
can
uh
can
search
for
dracula
and
willow
you
and
tara
could
uh
could
do
a
protection
spell
on
buffy's
mother's
house
and
prevent
him
from
returning
willow
nodding
got
it
how'd
he
get
inside
anyway
cut
to
joyce
walking
through
her
house
he
seemed
so
nice
and
normal
a
little
pale
we
see
willow
and
tara
working
magic
on
the
front
door
a
good
sunnydale
rule
of
thumb
avoid
whiteskinned
men
in
capes
i'm
not
like
this
i
don't
invite
strange
men
over
for
coffee
it's
just
oh
when
you
girls
are
older
you'll
understand
joyce
sits
on
stairs
it's
hard
to
date
sometimes
you
just
feel
like
giving
up
on
men
altogether
willow
and
tara
sneak
little
looks
at
each
other
and
try
not
to
grin
cut
to

of
the
sun
setting
on
the
horizon
cut
to
giles
and
riley
walking
through
the
grounds
of
a
mansion
riley
has
a
notepad
giles
carries
a
bag
another
bust
riley
crosses
something
off
on
notepad
and
it's
getting
dark
i
should
have
turned
up
a
better
lead
there
must
be
an
easier
way
to
find
him
too
late
to
worry
about
that
now
if
we
hurry
we
can
hit
these
last
places
they
leave
the
estate
cut
to
xander's
basement
how
come
i
have
to
be
here
slayersitting
while
the
other
guys
get
to
look
for
dracula

the
one
who
knows
him
ii'm
the
one
who
had
a
really
good
look
at
him
and
so
i
mean
what
xander
pushes
her
into
the
closet
and
shuts
the
door
hey
what
xander
puts
a
chair
under
the
doorknob
to
hold
it
shut
we
hear
anya
banging
on
the
door
and
yelling
