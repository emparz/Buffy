shannon
softly
wish

point
caleb
presses
in
his
dashboard
cigarette
lighter
my
words
just
curdle
in
your
ears
wouldn't
take
in
a
thing
caleb
shannon
looks
around
nervously
looks
out
the
window
head's
filled
with
so
much
filth
that
ain't
no
room
for
words
of
truth
well
you
know
what
you
are
shannon
dirty
shannon
offended

no
blame
here
you
were
born
dirty
born
without
a
soul
born
with
that
gaping
maw
wants
to
open
up
suck
out
a
man's
marrow
makes
me
puke
to
think
too
hard
on
it
caleb
shannon
touches
the
passenger
side
door
trying
to
open
it
but
there's
no
handle
yeah
that
there
door's
problematical
i
don't
know
as
i
could
recommend
steppin'
out
at
this
speed
anyway
you're
like
as
not
to
tumble
some
but
of
course
there's
my
boys
back
there—ooh
they
hate
to
miss
a
mark
shannon
shocked
your
boys
well
they
ain't
exactly
my
blue
eyed
boys
but
they're
hard
workers
and
they
don't
truck
with
satan—that
was
just
me
having
fun
caleb
looks
at
shannon
satan
is
a
little
man
caleb
shannon
reaches
for
the
steering
wheel
but
he
pushes
her
away
pinning
her
against
the
seat
then
shakes
his
finger
at
her
i
don't
like
backseat
drivers
caleb
reaches
to
the
dashboard
and
grabs
the
cigarette
lighter
he
places
the
heated
coil
of
the
lighter
on
a
ring
he's
wearing
on
the
middle
finger
of
his
right
hand
and
presses
it
for
a
moment
shannon
sees
what
caleb's
doing
and
cowers
pleasedon't
hurt
me
well
now
is
this
the
part
where
you
offer
to
do
anything
because
i
tried
to
make
it
clear—you
got
nothin'
i
want
to
explore
caleb
puts
the
lighter
back
in
the
dashboard
and
presses
his
heated
ring
into
shannon's
neck
making
a
sizzling
sound
shannon
screams
oh
yeah
that's
it
that's
a
cleansing
fire
hallelujah
now
if
i'm
not
mistaken
there's
a
car
a
little
ways
behind
us
and
i
do
believe
there's
some
folk
in
it
goin'
the
same
place
you
are
now
i
want
you
to
deliver
a
message
for
me
but
it's
not
for
them
it's
for
the
other
one—the
one
and
only
the
original
acceptnosubstitutes
slayer
would
you
tell
her
something
for
me
shannon
frightened
yes

shannon
caleb
takes
a
knife
and
stabs
shannon
in
the
stomach

in

ear

you

not

more
when
she
regains
consciousness
faith
scoffs
if

regains
consciousness
girl's
been

something's
killing

all
over

willow
drops
her

you

31
int
cellar
night
caleb
pours
wine
into
a
glass
directly
from
a
barrel
drink
of
this
for
it
is
my
blood
caleb
drinks
you
know
i
always
loved
the
story
of
the
last
supper
caleb
looks
at
his
glass
turns
paces
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
becoming
rich
red
wine
i
recall
as
a
boy
though
i
couldn't
help
but
think
what
would
happen
if
you
were
at
the
last
supper
and
you
ordered
the
white
a
nice
oaky
chardonnay
or
white
zin
i
mean
would
he
make
that
out
of
his
lymph
or
someall
caleb
shrugs
never
did
bring
it
up
suppose
there
was
a
reason
why
i
never
spent
too
long
in
one
parish
just
looking
for
answers
just
looking
for
the
lord
in
the
wrong
damn
places
caleb
gestures
to
someone
in
the
room
with
him
then
you
showed
me
the
light
do
you
think
i'm
god
first
buffy
os
walks
out
from
the
shadows
toward
caleb
i
certainly
do
not
i
am
beyond
concepts
like
that
but
you
still
wear
the
outfit
man
can't
turn
his
back
on
what
he
come
from
besides
black
is
slimming
caleb
looks
at
his
outfit
everyone
knows
that
how
do
you
like
what
i'm
wearing
just
another
dirty
girl
and
since
you
only
dress
up
in
dead
folk
i'm
guessing

you

kind

back
before
i
met
you
there
was
this
choir

in
knoxville
i
used
to
give
singing

she
even
screamed

followed
you

i
wanna
be
ready
to
move
when
we
find
him
we
don't
even
know
where
we're
going
's
why
i
figured
we'd
do
a
little
recon
first
buffy
to
faith
you
up
for
it
point
me
where
you
want
me
and
you're
certain
this
is
the
best
course
of
action
you
don't
even
know
what
this
man
has
of
yours—if
he
in
fact
has
anything
it
could
be
a
girl
a
potential
trying
to
get
to
us
could
be
a
stapler
going
in
anyway
with
the
girls
most
of
whom
have
yet
to
be
in
the
field
let
alone
in
a
life
or
death
situation
then
it's
time
we
test
them
look
i'll
just
take
the
ones
that
have
been
here
the
longest
the
rest
can
stay
behind
could
be
that's
just
what
he
wants
you
to
do—the
old
baitandswitch
yeah
he
lures
us
away
and
then
kills
the
girls
we
leave
behind
i
know
that's
why
i
need
you
to
stay
here
with
them
you're
my
most
powerful
weapon
will
i
know
you
can
keep
them
safe

got
trap
written

expecting
a

that's
why
we
have
to
move

cannot
go

when

do
they
just
roam

well
normally
they
show

like
this
guy
wants
to
be
found
lends
weight
to
the
whole
it's
a
trap
theory
buffy
snappily
i'm
through
waiting
around
for
people
to
attack
us
hey
i'm
with
you
drop
me
in
the
hornet's
nest
what
the
hell
you
got
a
rough
sitch
here
trying
to
turn
a
bunch
of
little
girls
into
an
army
they're
potential
slayers
just
like
we
were
right
maybe
they'll
do
as
good
as
us
they're
getting
better
i'll
work
with
'em
some
of
'em
seem
real
eager
fashion
disasters
yeah
but
they're
ready
to
fight
buffy
stops
walking
why
did
you
come
back
willow
said
you
needed
me
didn't
give
it
a
lot
of
thought
do
you—am
i
getting
you
want
me
to
be
not
here
buffy
sighs
no
that's
not
what
i
meant
i'mglad
that
you're
here
it's
good
thank
you
buffy
walks
no
problem
you
know
me
all
about
the
good
deeds
willow
said
you
helped
out
angel
yeah
he
says
hi
really
sure
how
is
he
better
had
to
do
this
whole
magical
mindwalk
with
him
you
were
in
angel's
mind
buffy
faith
stops
looks
at
the
barnlike
building
that
the
bringer
walked
up
to
what
is
this
place
look
there's
more
of
them
i
think
we
just
found
our
hornet's
nest
let's
get
the
cavalry
cut
to
41
int
living
room
at
buffy's
house
night
xander
is
holding
a
spiked
baseball
bat
and
talking
to
the
potentials
now
remember
we're
looking
for
killing
blows
only
people
xander
hands
bat
to
rona
so
chest
and
throat
if
it's
a
vampire
stomach
chest
and
face
if
it's
a
bringer
what
if
it's
something
else
could
happen
something
otherworldly
and
here's
a
handy
rule
don't
go
for
the
flashy
tentacles
just
because
they're
waving
'em
about
trying
to
get
attention
go
for
the
center—
xander
points
to
each
brains
heart
eyes
everything's
got
eyes
except
the
bringers
except
the
bringers
i
don't
want
there
to
be
tentacles
i'm
not
good
with
squishy
i
don't
care
if
it's
godzilla
kennedy
raises
a
huge
sword
i
want
to
get
in
this
thing
godzilla's
mostly
tokyobased
so
he's
probably
a
noshow
besides
if
matthew
broderick
can
kill
godzilla
how
tough
is
he
andrew
whines
xander
andrew
crosses
his
arms
petulantly
matthew
broderick
did
not
kill
godzilla
he
killed
a
big
dumb
lizard
that
was
not
the
real
godzilla
you
people
are
even
crazier
than
her
than
who
buffy
man
i
mean
taking
us
right
into
the
bad
guy's
lair
well
that's
where
generally
speaking
you'd
go
to
find
the
bad
guy
and
i
don't
think
you
came
here
to
fight
plaque
no
i
came
here
for
protection
well
you
signed
on
to
fight
with—
look
i
know
but
rona
sighs
this
plan
is
trouble
ok
buffy
doesn't
care
how
many
of
us
she
puts
in
danger—
let
me
tell
you
something
about
buffy
in
fact
you
should
all
listen
to
this
uh
we
kinda
were
i've
been
through
more
battles
with
buffy
than
you
all
can
ever
imagine
she's
stopped
everything
that's
ever
come
up
against
her
xander
buffy
and
faith
walk
through
the
front
door
and
overhear
xander's
speech
she's
laid
down
her
life—literally—to
protect
the
people
around
her
this
girl
has
died
two
times
and
she's
still
standing
you're
scared
that's
smart
you
got
questions
you
should
but
you
doubt
her
motives
you
think
buffy's
all
about
the
kill
then
you
take
the
little
bus
to
battle
xander
buffy
tears
up
i've
seen
her
heart
and
this
time—not
literally
and
i'm
telling
you
right
now
she
cares
more
about
your
lives
than
you
will
ever
know
you
gotta
trust
her
she's
earned
it
andrew
and
dawn
are
crying
damn
i
never
knew
you
were
that
cool
faith
everyone
turns
to
look
at
buffy
and
faith
well
you
always
were
a
little
slow
i
get
that
now
all
right
let's
saddle

ext
sh

brought
a
small
gang
with
her
to
the
vineyard—faith
spike
xander
kennedy
rona
molly
chaoahn
amanda
and
another
potential
they
walk
up
to
the
front
door
then
buffy
pauses
to
address
the
team
ok
set
up
a
perimeter
guard
the
door
i
don't
want
anything
getting
in
behind
us
my
team
goes
in
first
we
check
the
place
out
you
guys
are
our
safetynet
if
this
place
is
a
trap
we
give
the
signal
you
guys
come
in
guns
ablazing
so
what's
the
signal
i'm
thinking
lots
and
lots
of
yelling
got
it
shall
we
buffy
leads
a
subset
of
the
team
inside
cut
to
43
int
wine
cellar
at
the
shadow
valley
vineyards
night
buffy
walks
down
the
steps
into
the
wine
cellar
followed
by
molly
kennedy
rona
and
chaoahn
molly
looking
around
what
is
this
place
looks
like
an
old
vineyard
an
evil
vineyard
huh
like
falcon
crest
buffy
looking
in
the
shadows
stay
alert
you
guys
bringers
are
here
somewhere
just
need
to
find
out
where
shouldn't
be
too
hard
bringers
come
out
of
the
shadows
from
behind
the
barrels
of
wine
and
attack
buffy
and
gang
the
fight
is
fairly
even
suddenly
the
bringers
stop
fighting
and
walk
back
into
the
shadows
caleb
walks
out
into
the
light
well
now
you
girls
are
just
burning
with
righteousness
aren't
you
problem
is
you
think
you're
blazing
like
suns
when
really
you're
burning
like
matchsticks
in
the
face
of
the
darkness
you
having
fun
now
i
hope
my
boys
haven't
worn
you
out
too
much—i
need
you
fit
for
when
i
purify
you
save
the
sermon
padre
i
heard
you
have
something
of
mine
caleb
chuckles
well
i
do
now
you
liked
my
little
message
did
you
you
know
i
ruined
a
perfectly
good
knife
on
that
girl
got
her
soiled
blood
all
over
the
place
i
may
have
to
get
a
new
truck
caleb
buffy
looks
taken
aback
so
you're
the
slayer
the
slayer
the
strongest
the
fastest
the
most
aflame
with
that
most
precious
invention
of
all
mankind—the
notion
of
goodness
the
slayer
must
indeed
be
powerful
caleb
with
one
powerful
punch
he
sends
buffy
flying
across
the
room
so
what
else
you
got
caleb
looks
around
smugly
fade
to
black
act

and
attacks
caleb
caleb
pushes
him
down
with
ease
spike
tries
to
get
up
but
caleb
headbutts
him
then
throws
him
across
the
room
into
a
huge
wine
storage
tank
that
busts
when
spike
hits
it
wine
pours
out
of
the
tank
and
washes
spike
across
the
floor
kennedy
and
the
other
potentials
get
into
gear
and
join
the
fight
let's
go
the
bringers
come
back
out
of
the
shadows
to
fight
the
potentials
as
well
kennedy
storms
caleb
but
has
to
engage
a
bringer
instead
caleb
punches
kennedy
knocking
her
into
a
stack
of
wine
barrels
rona
worried
kennedy
rona
runs
toward
kennedy
but
caleb
cuts
her
off
she
swings
the
spiked
baseball
bat
at
caleb
but
he
catches
it
and
looks
her
in
the
eyes
caleb
to
rona
miss
i
do
believe
you
have
your
own
problems
you
should
be
worrying
about
caleb
breaks
rona's
arm
with
ease
sending
her
reeling
back
in
agony
caleb
chuckles
and
bends
to
pick
up
a
knife
from
the
floor
he
tosses
the
knife
to
a
nearby
bringer
who
swings
it
back
ready
to
plunge
it
into
rona's
body
an
arrow
pierces
the
bringer's
forearm
as
he
rears
back
they
turn
to
look
and
see
xander
standing
there
with
a
bow
faith's
there
beside
him
the
bringer
leaves
rona
and
fights
with
xander
oh
good
there's
more
of
you
faith
charges
at
caleb
xander
sees
buffy
lying
unconscious
against
the
wall
where
she
fell
when
caleb
threw
her
buffy
xander
runs
to
buffy
fighting
off
bringers
on
his
way
to
her
side
holding
a
knife
in
each
hand
faith
engages
caleb
in
a
fight
but
she's
not
seeming
to
faze
him
caleb
looks
faith
up
and
down
well
you're
the
other
one
aren't
you
your
cain
to
her
abel
caleb
faith
throws
a
knife
at
caleb
no
offense
meant
to
cain
of
course
faith
attacks
caleb
with
her
other
knife
but
he
grabs
her
arm
twists
it
and
crosses
it
with
her
other
arm
in
a
fashion
such
that
she
can't
move
but
is
looking
right
at
him
he
squeezes
her
hands
until
she's
forced
to
drop
the
knife
faith
grunts
at
him
and
knees
him
in
the
crotch
causing
caleb
to
let
go
of
her
just
enough
that
she
can
escape
his
grasp
she
backhands
him
across
the
face
faith
through
gritted
teeth
never
was
much
for
the
good
book
caleb
grabs
faith's
arm
and
twists
it
painfully
behind
her
back
causing
her
to
double
over
she
falls
to
her
knees
as
he
twists
and
pulls
her
arm
and
walks
around
to
the
front
of
her
oh
it
has
its
moments
paul
had
some
good
stuff
for
instance
but
overall
i
find
it
a
tad
complicated
caleb
slaps
faith
i
like
to
keep
things
simple
caleb
kicks
faith
across
the
room
into
a
stack
of
wine
barrels
good
folk
bad
folk
caleb
a
potential
with
long
black
hair
swings
at
caleb
but
he
grabs
her
sword
then
her
face
clean
folk
dirty

caleb
snaps
the
potential's
neck
and
drops
her
to
the
ground

them
out

have
to
retreat

walks
menacingly
toward
molly
who
backs
up
slowly
frozen
with
fear
she
raises
her
arm
back
to
stab
him
but
he
grabs
her
wrist
then
her
neck

squeezes
molly's
neck
lifting
her
off
the

tries
to
go
to
her
but
bringers
keep
attacking
her
slowing
her
down

i
work
in
mysterious
ways
caleb
stabs
molly
lets
go
of
her
neck
dropping
her
to
the
ground
also
some
fairly
straightforward
ones
enraged
at
seeing
what
he
did
to
molly
buffy
rushes
caleb
she
fights
him
more
evenly
this
time
avoiding
his
punches
and
landing
a
few
of
her
own

punches
him
so
hard

caleb
rears
his
hand
back
in

of
xander's
face

about
that

now
it's
a
simple
story
stop
me
if
you've
heard
it
i
have
found
and
truly
believe
that
there
is
nothing
so
bad
it
cannot
be
made
better
with
a
story
buffy
just
stares
at
xander
his
head
and
his

looking
forlorn
and
troubled
but
this
