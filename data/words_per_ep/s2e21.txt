a
town
square
in
galway
ireland
1753
the
camera
looks
straight
down
from
above
onto
the
cobblestones
a
lone
rider
on
his
horse
passes
underneath
and
the
camera
follows
them
past
a
well
as
angelus
narrates
there's
moments
in
your
life
that
make
you
that
set
the
course
of
who
you're
gonna
be
sometimes
they're
little
subtle
moments
sometimes
they're
not
i'll
show
you
what
i
mean
the
horseman
continues
past
a
tavern
on
the
far
side
of
the
square
the
door
opens
and
a
young
drunk
angel
and
his
drunk
friend
are
thrown
out
angel
with
an
irish
accent
we'll
be
back
when
we've
found
a
bit
more
cash
money
keep
the
girls
warm
the
tavern
proprietor
slams
the
door
shut
and
angel
pounds
on
it
a
couple
of
times
friend
moans
let's
go
angel
staggers
back
over
to
him
and
puts
his
arm
around
him
they
begin
to
walk
with
a
definite
sway
in
their
step
come
on
we'll
sneak
in
and
take
some
of
me
father's
silver
he'll
never
miss
it
he
eats
with
his
hands
the
pig
his
friend
is
too
drunk
to
go
on
and
faints
dead
away
falling
out
of
angel's
arm
to
the
pavement
angel
looks
down
at
him
ah
why
don't
you
rest
right
here
he
takes
a
look
around
and
spots
a
noble
lady
in
a
fancy
period
dress
standing
in
an
alley
beyond
an
archway
the
woman
gives
a
slight
backward
glance
to
be
sure
she
has
his
attention
and
starts
to
walk
further
into
the
alley
disappearing
around
a
corner
from
angel's
view
he
follows
her
cut
to
the
alley
the
woman
continues
her
slow
pace
and
looks
up
when
angel
comes
through
the
archway
and
begins
to
speak
as
she
gets
closer
to
the
camera
it
becomes
clear
that
the
woman
is
darla
her
long
curly
blonde
hair
is
very
nicely
coiffed
so
i'd
ask
myself
what's
a
lady
of
your
station
doing
alone
in
an
alley
with
the
reputation
that
this
one
has
darla
still
facing
away
maybe
she's
lonely
in
that
case
i'd
offer
myself
as
escort
to
protect
you
from
harm
and
to
while
away
the
dull
hours
you're
very
gracious
hm
it's
often
been
said
darla
turns
to
face
him
are
you
certain
you're
up
to
the
challenge
angel
approaches
her
milady
you'll
find
that
with
the
exception
of
an
honest
day's
work
there's
no
challenge
i'm
not
prepared
to
face
he
stops
in
front
of
her
and
looks
into
her
eyes
oh
but
you're
a
pretty
thing
where
are
you
from
darla
smiles
around
everywhere
i
never
been
anywhere
myself
always
wanted
to
see
the
world
but
i
could
show
you
darla
smiles
could
you
then
things
you've
never
seen
never
even
heard
of
sounds
exciting
it
is
and
frightening
i'm
not
afraid
show
me
show
me
your
world
darla
closes
her
eyes
close
your
eyes
angel
follows
her
example
the
camera
follows
her
hand
as
she
puts
it
on
his
shoulder
and
continues
up
to
show
her
face
vamped
out
she
smiles
lets
out
a
low
growl
and
opens
wide
as
she
leans
in
to
bite
him
when
he
feels
the
pain
his
eyes
open
wide
and
he
gasps
he
can't
keep
steady
and
sinks
to
his
knees
darla
lets
go
of
her
bite
revealing
his
bloody
neck
and
stands
up
straight
she
lifts
her
hand
to
her
chest
and
draws
a
sharp
fingernail
across
the
skin
above
her
breasts
allowing
blood
to
trickle
out
she
grabs
him
by
the
back
of
the
neck
and
pulls
him
in
to
her
bosom
so
that
his
lips
fall
directly
onto
the
cut
forcing
him
to
taste
of
her
blood
he
puts
his
arms
around
her
and
drinks
cut
to
the
cemetery
in
sunnydale
1998
angelus
walks
through
carefully
and
quietly
while
watching
buffy
fight
a
pair
of
vampires
nearby
he
sees
her
kick
one
and
then
the
other
and
then
continues
on
to
a
better
vantage
point
one
of
the
vampires
rushes
buffy
and
she
flips
him
over
onto
his
back
nice
try
the
other
one
comes
at
her
again
with
a
swing
she
ducks
it
and
punches
him
in
the
face
in
the
gut
and
again
in
the
face
he
falls
to
the
ground
dazed
the
first
one
comes
at
her
again
with
a
kick
but
she
blocks
it
with
her
arm
backhand
punches
him
in
the
face
jabs
him
in
the
gut
and
grabs
his
arm
twisting
it
up
high
and
forcing
him
to
his
knees
in
pain
angelus
looks
on
from
behind
a
tree
and
smiles
the
second
vampire
gets
back
up
and
rushes
her
without
letting
go
of
the
first
one
she
cleanly
jams
her
stake
into
the
other
one's
chest
and
he
crumbles
into
ashes
angelus
can't
help
but
snicker
buffy
turns
her
attention
back
to
the
one
she's
holding
and
punches
him
in
the
face
making
him
roll
away
i
want
you
to
get
a
message
to
angel
for
me
tell
him
i'm
done
waiting
i'm
taking
the
fight
to
him
angelus
smiles
as
he
listens
you
got
that
need
me
to
write
it
down
for
you
the
vampire
gets
up
and
charges
her
she
grabs
him
and
pulls
him
around
and
down
to
the
ground
and
immediately
plunges
her
stake
home
he
bursts
into
ashes
alright
i'll
tell
him
myself
she
gets
up
and
walks
over
behind
a
gravestone
where
she
reaches
down
to
help
someone
up
xander
moans
i'm
good
don't
worry
about
me
xander
rubs
his
neck
you
know

don't
have
to
patrol
with
me
xander
indicates
the
pile
of
ash
i
had
that
guy
under
control
until
he
resorted
to
fisticuffs
xander
cranes
his
neck
oh

vampires

three
nights

cemetery

the
watchful
eyes
of

smirks
and

to
leave

other

plays
part

the
research
lab
at
the
sunnydale
museum
of
natural
history
the
camera
pans
across
a
large
rectangular
chunk
of
rock
over
to
a
technician
she
is
carefully
cleaning
off
a
section
of
the
rock
she
lets
a
jet
of
compressed
air
blow
away
some
dust
a
moment
later
she
lets
another
jet
go
and
then
reaches
up
with
a
brush
and
runs
it
across
the
rock
dr
doug
perren
one
of
the
museum
curators
comes
over
to
check
her
progress
careful
now
doug
points
concentrate
in
this
area
doug
watches
her
work
a
moment
there
you
go
the
door
opens
behind
him
and
he
turns
to
see
giles
come
in
hello
doug
comes
to
greet
him
rupert
giles
yes
doug
perren
doug
shakes
his
hand
thanks
for
coming
oh
not
at
all
it's
flattered
to
be
asked
i
spoke
with
lou
tabor
at
the
washington
institute
and
he
told
me
we
had
the
best
authority
on
obscure
relics
right
here
in
sunnydale
oh
giles
laughs
he
may
have
uh
exaggerated
a
little
giles
sees
the
obelisk
ah
is
this
the
this
is
our
baby
doug
they
approach
it
construction
workers
dug
it
up
outside
of
town
don't
have
a
clue
what
it
is
any
ideas
giles
touches
and
looks
at
the
rock
a
few
none
i'd
care
to
share
until
i
can
verify
giles
notices
the
runes
on
it
you
have
uh
carbon
dated
it
giles
inspects
the
writings
the
results'll
be
back
in
a
couple
of
days
i'll
go
out
on
a
limb
and
say
old
giles
smirks
um
yes
it
it
certainly
giles
picks
up
a
jar
and
a
scraper
predates
any
uh
settlements
we've
read
about
giles
points
um
may
may
i
yeah
sure
giles
leans
in
and
begins
to
scrape
at
the
corner
of
the
obelisk
catching
the
debris
in
the
jar
he
digs
into
an
apparent
groove
a
few
scrapes
later
he
stops
and
taps
the
scraper
clean
on
the
jar
i
assume
you've
uh
you
haven't
tried
to
open
it
open
it
he
leans
over
to
see
what
giles
has
discovered
ah
i'll
be
damned
i
figured
it
was
solid
what
do
you
think
is
in
there
giles
staring
intently
i
don't
know
well
i
guess
we
won't
know
until
we
open
it
up
giles
considers
yes
but
could
i
ask
um
would
you
wait
i
uh
i'd
like
to
work
on
translating
the
text
ititit
might
give
us
an
indication
of
what
we'll
find
inside
you
don't
want
to
be
surprised
aas
a
rule
no
alright
you're
the
expert
but
i'm
pretty
damn
curious
though
giles
removes
his
glasses
yes
yes
so
am
i
cut
to
the
cafeteria
at
sunnydale
high
the
camera
focuses
on
two
fish
sticks
that
xander
is
holding
one
with
a
toothpick
stuck
through
the
middle
he
plays
with
them
like
puppets
moving
the
one
with
the
toothpick
around
tell
angel
i'm
gonna
kill
him
no
wait
i'm
gonna
kill
you
he
starts
to
repeatedly
stab
the
toothpick
into
the
other
fish
stick
the
camera
pulls
back
and
up
to
his
face
die
die
die
he
makes
an
anguished
face
and
lets
the
fish
stick
fall
aah
xander
makes
a
thudding
noise
xander
squeals
mother
xander
smiles
is
that
it
yeah
that's
it
xander
chuckles
scene
xander
grins
cut
to
willow
oz
and
buffy
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
willow
is
sitting
on
oz's
lap
that's
exactly
how
it
happened
well
i
thought
it
was
riveting
uh
i
was
a
little
unclear
about
some
of
the
themes
the
theme
is
angel's
too
much
of
a
coward
to
take
me
on
faceto
face
xander
still
playing
with
the
fish
sticks
and
the
other
theme
was
'buy
american'
but
it
uh
got
kind
of
buried
willow
to
buffy
do
you
think
you're
ready
to
fight
angel
i
wish
people
would
stop
asking
me
that
yes
i'm
ready
i'm
also
willing
and
able
just
the
one
test
i
might
actually
pass
don't
say
that
you're
gonna
pass
everything
i
will
get
you
through
this
semester
if
i
have
to
sweat
blood

you
think
you're
likely
to
'cause
i'd
like
to
be
elsewhere

was
only
metaphor

think

sweat
cute
blood

booths

she
steps
in
through
the

where
the
priest
waits
and
muffled

science
classroom
after

is
tutoring
buffy
in
chemistry
buffy
gives
up
in
frustration
and
slaps
down
her
pencil
waah

doesn't
make
any
sense
buffy
pouts
at
willow
well
sure
it
does
see
willow
takes
the
paper
and
looks
oh
no
this
doesn't
make
any
sense
buffy
shrugs
it's
senseless
buffy
plays
with
her
pencil
willow
encouragingly
it
is
but
at
least
you
know
that
so
you're
learning
willow
looks
at
the
problem
more
closely
yay
me
well
it
doesn't
matter
anyway
i
mean
when
in
the
real
world
am
i
ever
gonna
need
chemistry
or
history
or
math
or
the
english
language
willow
shoots
buffy
a
glance
okay
i
see
your
problem
i'm
a
moron
willow
gives
buffy
a
look
will
you
stop
that
you're
not
stupid
you've
just
had
a
lot
on
your
mind
you
can
learn
this
real
easily
but
if
you're
just
gonna
give
up
then
don't
waste
my
time
buffy
impressed
wow
you
really
are
a
good
teacher
buffy
smiles
okay
look
at
this
a
covalent
bond
which
means
these
two
atoms
are
linked
by
this
buffy
puts
her
pencil
down
on
her
open
book
and
it
rolls
off
of
the
desk
and
into
the
space
between
it
and
the
filing
cabinet
next
to
it
ohh
buffy
moans
hold
that
thought
she
reaches
down
and
in
with
her
fingers
and
pulls
the
pencil
out
in
the
process
she
bumps
the
disk
with
the
pencil
so
it
now
leans
against
the
desk
instead
of
the
cabinet
buffy
sits
back
up
okay
i'm
learn
girl
okay
willow
points
to
the
paper
so
see
here
buffy
has
an
epiphany
deja
vu
really
yeah
i
have
this
perfect
memory
of
the
pencil
and
she
drops
the
pencil
onto
her
book
again
it
rolls
off
of
the
desk
again
falls
and
hits
the
disk
she
looks
over
into
the
space
and
sees
the
disk
she
reaches
down
again
for
it
and
her
pencil
oh
hey
buffy
pulls
up
the
disk
and
pencil
you
dropped
this
she
hands
the
unlabeled
yellow
disk
to
willow
who
looks
at
it
curiously
it's
not
mine
it
might
be
something
of
ms
calendar's
she
inserts
the
disk
into
her
laptop's
floppy
drive
this
feels
kinda
morbid
willow
smiles
at
buffy
i've
gone
through
most
of
her
files
already
does
that
make
it
less
morbid
or
you
really
morbid
the
program
on
the
disk
starts
up
and
the
rumanian
text
scrolls
into
the
lefthand

willow
sighs
i
had

disappears
and
the
english
translation
scrolls
into
the
righthand
window
buffy
looks
closely

that
say
'restoration'
buffy
keeps
reading

of
her
spells

a
practicing
witch
but
she
did
dabble
buffy
interrupts
willow
buffy
keeps

back
at

and
begins
reading
more
she
quickly
realizes
what
they've
found

oh
boy
oh

the

on
buffy

sitting
at
the

giles
walks
up
to
buffy
and
willow
what
are
you
saying
the
curse
buffy
holds
out
a
printout
this
is
it
looks
like
ms
calendar
was
trying
to
replicate
the
original
curse
to
restore
angel's
soul
again
giles
takes
the
printout
stares
at
it
she
said
it
couldn't
be
done
well
she
tried
anyway
and
it
looks
like
it
might
have
worked
so
he
killed
her
before
she
could
tell
anyone
about
it
what
a
prince
huh
xander
looks
away
this
is
good
right
i
mean
we
can
curse
him
again
buffy
paces
thinking
um
well
this
um
certainly
points
the
way
but
the
ritual
itself
requires
a
greater
knowledge
of
the
black
arts
than
i
i
i
can
claim
well
i've
been
going
through
her
files
and
and
researching
the
black
arts
for
fun
or
educational
fun
and
i
may
be
able
to
work
this
giles
very
concerned
wwillow
channeling
such
potent
magicks
through
yourself
it
could
open
a
door
that
you
may
not
be
able
to
close
i
don't
want
you
putting
yourself
in
any
danger
will
and
i
don't
want
danger
big
'no'
to
danger
but
i
may
be
the
best
person
to
do
this
hi
for
those
of
you
who
have
just
tuned
in
xander
gets
up
everyone
here
is
a
crazy
person
xander
walks
to
the
end
of
the
table
so
this
spell
might
restore
angel's
humanity
well
here's
an
interesting
angle
xander
harshly
who
cares
i
care
xander
not
surprised
is
that
right
let's
not
lose
our
perspective
here
xander
willow
looks
at
xander
disbelieving
what
she's
hearing
from
him
xander
standing
his
ground
i'm
perspective
guy
angel's
a
killer
xander
it's
not
that
simple
xander
disgusted
what
all
is
forgiven
i
can't
believe
you
people
cordelia
gets
up
xander
has
a
point
xander
to
cordelia
in
a
raised
voice
you
know
just
for
once
i
wish
you'd
support
me
and
i
realize
right
now
that
you
were
and
i'm
embarrassed
so
i'm
gonna
get
back
to
the
point
xander
to
the
others
which
is
that
angel
needs
to
die
curing
angel
seems
to
have
been
jenny's
last
wish
yeah
well
jenny's
dead
giles
approaches
xander
angrily
don't
you
ever
speak
of
her
in
that
tone
again
xander
yells
back
can't
you
hear
what
i'm
saying
they
begin
to
argue
heatedly
buffy
rushes
over
and
gets
between
them
stop
it
stop
it
they
all
shut
up
and
glare
at
each
other
for
a
moment
buffy
turns
away
and
goes
over
to
willow
very
upset
giles
paces
away
also
very
upset
willow
quietly
what
do
you
wanna
do
buffy
sighs
buffy
quietly
ii
don't
know
what
happened
to
angel
wasn't
his
fault
yeah
but
what
happened
to
ms
calendar
is
buffy
and
willow
stare
at
him
in
disbelief
xander
very
coldly
you
can
paint
this
any
way
you
want
but
the
way
i
see
it
is
that
you
wanna
forget
all
about
ms
calendar's
murder
so
you
can
get
your
boyfriend
back
buffy
refuses
to
listen
to
any
more
of
this
and
walks
out
of
the
library
willow
and
giles
just
stare
at
xander
in
surprise
and
shock
he
walks
back
to
his
chair
at
the
table
cut
to
the
museum
research
lab
dr
perren
is
going
over
his
notes
when
he
hears
some
whispering
coming
from
behind
him
he
turns
around
to
look
but
no
one's
there
hello
he
gets
up
and
slowly
walks
over
to
the
obelisk
the
whispering
gets
louder
as
he
nears
it
he
reaches
up
to
the
runes
on
the
face
of
the
rock
and
touches
them
the
whispering
seems
to
be
coming
from
inside
he
places
his
hand
flat
on
the
face
of
the
rock
and
stares
up
at
it
in
amazement
suddenly
drusilla
wraps
her
hand
around
his
mouth
from
behind
and
pulls
his
head
back
to
expose
his
neck
she
leans
in
and
bites
him
hard
as
he
struggles
to
get
away
behind
her
angelus
and
two
other
vampires
approach
the
obelisk
i'll
have
one
of
these
to
go
the
two
vampires
walk
around
the
rock
with
some
rope
and
tools
to
haul
it
away
dru
she
jerks
her
head
up
from
her
victim
and
turns
her
eyes
toward
him
growling
and
smiling
a
most
evil
smile
save
me
some
cut
to
buffy's
room
at
home
she
piles
a
bunch
of
stakes
and
crosses
into
her
bag
while
talking
on
the
phone
with
willow
well
i'll
do
a
couple
of
sweeps
and
then
i'll
stop
by
buffy
listens
yeah
xander
was
pretty
much
being
a
willow
where
did
you
learn
that
word
my
god
you
kiss
your
mother
with
that
mouth
she
goes
over
to
her
desk
while
listening
to
willow
talk
some
more
she
grabs
a
couple
more
stakes
from
the
top
left
drawer
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
what
i
wanna
do
at
the
bottom
of
the
drawer
she
sees
the
claddagh
ring
that
angel
gave
her
and
stares
at
it
sadly
for
a
moment
she
reaches
in
for
it
and
holds
it
gently
with
her
fingers
remembering
i'll
i'll
see
you
in
a
little
while
okay
she
turns
off
the
phone
and
sets
it
down
she
holds
the
ring
with
both
hands
again
and
gazes
at
the
design
two
hands
for
friendship
a
crown
for
loyalty
and
a
heart
for
love
cut
to
the
park
buffy
walks
through
on
patrol
and
heads
into
some
bushes
she
stops
and
jerks
her
head
aside
when
she
hears
something
snap
slowly
she
takes
a
few
more
steps
to
investigate
she
hears
another
sound
behind
her
and
spins
around
to
look
nothing
again
she
takes
a
couple
of
steps
suddenly
kendra
comes
out
of
the
bushes
to
stand
right
behind
her
buffy
instantly
pivots
around
with
her
fist
held
up
ready
to
punch
she
stays
herself
when
she
recognizes
the
other
girl
buffy
exhales
you
know
polite
people
call
before
they
jump
out
of
the
bushes
and
attack
you
kendra
in
her
accent
just
wanted
to
test
your
reflexes
how
about
testing
my
facepunching
'cause
i
think
you'll
find
it's
improved
i
was
on
my
way
to
your
house
saw
you
walking
couldn't
help
meself
buffy
smiles
which
begs
the
question
and
don't
think
i'm
not
glad
to
see
you
but
why
are
you
here
buffy
kendra
starts
to
answer
oh
wait
no
let
me
guess
your
watcher
informed
you
buffy
imitating
her
accent
dat
a
very
dark
power
is
about
to
rise
in
sunnydale
dat's
about
it
great
so
you
have
any
idea
what
this
dark
power
is
cut
to
the
main
hall
in
angelus'
mansion
he
and
drusilla
walk
in
across
the
marble
floor
to
where
spike
is
sitting
in
his
wheelchair
staring
at
the
obelisk
set
in
front
of
the
huge
fireplace
spike
hears
them
coming
it's
a
big
rock
i
can't
wait
to
tell
my
friends
they
don't
have
a
rock
this
big
spike
boy
you
never
did
learn
your
history
let's
have
a
lesson
then
acathla
the
demon
came
forth
to
swallow
the
world
angelus
strolls
to
the
obelisk
he
was
killed
by
a
virtuous
knight
who
pierced
the
demon's
heart
before
he
could
draw
a
breath
to
perform
the
act
acathla
turned
to
stone
as
demons
sometimes
do
and
was
buried
angelus
turns
to
face
spike
where
neither
man
nor
demon
would
want
to
look
starts
away
from
the
obelisk
unless
of
course
they're
putting
up
lowrent
housing
boys
the
two
vampires
reach
up
with
crowbars
and
pry
open
the
tomb
the
lid
crashes
to
the
floor
stirring
up
plenty
of
dust
inside
is
a
tall
horned
stockily
built
stone
demon
with
a
sword
protruding
from
the
right
side
of
its
chest
upon
seeing
him
drusilla
closes
her
eyes
raises
her
hands
to
the
sides
of
her
head
and
begins
to
sway
it
back
and
forth
he
fills
my
head
i
can't
hear
anything
else
let
me
guess
someone
pulls
out
the
sword
someone
worthy
mm
the
demon
wakes
up
and
wackiness
ensues
drusilla
opens
her
eyes
lowers
her
arms
he
will
swallow
the
world
and
every
creature
living
on
this
planet
will
go
to
hell
he
walks
up
to
acathla
for
a
closer
look
and
turns
to
face
the
others
my
friends
we're
about
to
make
history
end

makes
his

and
disappears
further
down

the
bum
tired
and
weak
staggers
into
a
concrete
post
at
the
side
of
the
alley
and

and
rolls
around

with

just
breathes
for

smells
something

searches
the
alley
with
his
eyes
and
spots
a
rat
scampering
across
to
the
other
side
he
takes
a
couple
of
unsteady
steps
brushes
the
hair
from
his
face

begins
to
stalk

disappears
into

up
to
him

buffy
considers
for
a
moment
huh
cut
to
a
cemetery
buffy
lands
flat
on
her
back
oof
a
vampire
props
himself
over
her
growling
menacingly
she
is
very
frightened
and
looks
around
frantically
for
what
to
do
angel
watches
from
behind
some
gravestones
buffy
spots
her
stake
but
can't
reach
it
so
she
just
gets
her
hands
underneath
the
vampire
and
pushes
him
off
he
flies
off
of
her
and
lands
hard
on
his
back
oh
god
she
rolls
onto
her
hands
and
knees
and
scrambles
on
all
fours
to
retrieve
her
stake
oh
god
oh
oh
god
unh
she
grabs
the
stake
and
quickly
gets
to
her
feet
she
looks
at
it
unsure
of
what
to
do
next
the
vampire
gets
up
and
lunges
at
her
reflexively
she
grabs
him
sidesteps
him
and
sends
him
flipping
over
to
the
ground
again
dazed
she
looks
at
the
vampire
amazed
by
what
she
just
did
she
glances
back
at
the
watcher
down
at
her
stake
and
then
makes
her
move
to
dispatch
the
vampire
she
quickly
gets
to
her
knees
raises
the
stake
above
her
head
and
plunges
it
into
him
but
gets
him
in
the
gut
instead
of
the
chest
oh
not
the
heart
angel
watches
concerned
buffy
plunges
the
stake
into
the
vampire
again
and
this
time
hits
her
mark
an
instant
later
the
vampire
bursts
into
ashes
buffy
is
caught
by
surprise
and
she
screams
and
jumps
back
landing
on
her
butt
she
just
stares
at
the
ashes
on
the
grass
in
wide
eyed
shock
behind
her
the
watcher
steps
up
you
see
you
see
your
power

isn't
at
all

she
wants
to

in
me

lets
go
and
kendra
is
completely
under
her

move
to
stay

extends
out
the
fingers
of
her
right
hand
at

evilly
as
she
swings
her
hand
up
and
slices
kendra's
neck
with

sharp
nails

grabs
at
her
neck
as
it
begins
to

heavily
and
collapses
to
the
floor
drusilla
watches
her
fall
and
turns
to
look
down
at
her
nightnight
she
kisses
the
air
above

and

to
her
accomplices
let's
get

of
them

an
unconscious

by

runs
across

cut
into
the
halls

throws
open
the
door
and
rushes
in
as
she
rounds
a
corner
the
scene
slows
buffy
runs
down
the
hall
in
slow
motion
as
whistler
narrates
over
the
scene
bottom
line
is
even
if
you
see
'em
coming
you're
not
ready
for
the
big
moments
buffy
barges
into
the
library
and
stops
no
one
asks
for
their
life
to
change
not
really
but
it
does
she
looks
around
at
the
damage
and
then
sees
kendra
lying
on
the
floor
she
runs
to
her
still
in
slow
motion
and
skids
down
next
to
her
on
her
knees
she
sees
that
she's
gone
and
takes
her
hand
so
what
are
we
helpless
puppets
no
the
big
moments
are
gonna
come
you
can't
help
that
it's
what
you
do
afterwards
that
counts
that's
when
you
find
out
who
you
are
buffy
reaches
up
to
kendra's
face
with
her
other
hand
and
strokes
it
gently
behind
her
a
police
officer
raises
his
gun
at
her
freeze
buffy
looks
back
at
him
seemingly
caught
redhanded
you'll
see
what
i
mean
to
be
continued
