outside
the
museum
buffy
willow
and
xander
are
walking
past
the
rose
gardens
toward
the
building
this
is
so
unfair
i
don't
think
it's
that
bad
it's
the
uebersuck
mom
could've
at
least
warned
me
well
a
lot
of
parents
are
doing
it
this
year
it's
part
of
this
whole
cultural
exchange
magilla
the
exhibit
the
dance
i
have
the
best
costume
for
the
dance
a
complete
stranger
in
my
house
for
two
weeks
i'm
gonna
be
insane
a
danger
to
myself
and
others
within
three
days
i
swear
i
think
the
exchange
student
program's
cool
xander
gets
a
look
from
buffy
i
do
it's
a
beautiful
melding
of
two
cultures
have
you
ever
done
an
exchange
program
my
dad
tried
to
send
me
to
some
armenians
once
does
that
count
they
climb
the
steps
to
the
building
entrance
and
the
cultural
exchange
exhibit
cut
inside
cordelia
and
two
other
girls
are
looking
over
the
pictures
of
the
exchange
students
ooo
there's
mine
sven
isn't
he
lunchable
mine's
definitely
the
best
she
walks
past
buffy
what're
you
lookin'
at
pictures
of
our
exchange
students
look
100
swedish
100
gorgeous
100
staying
at
my
house
so
how's
yours
visually
i
mean
i
don't
know
guy
like
by
guylike
we
are
talking
big
beefy
guylike
girl
right
i
was
just
told
'guy'
you
didn't
look
at
him
first
he
could
be
dogly
you
live
on
the
edge
cordelia
walks
off
hold
on
a
sec
so
this
person
who's
living
with
you
for
two
weeks
is
a
man
with
man
parts
this
is
a
terrible
idea
what
about
the
beautiful
melding
of
two
cultures
there's
no
melding
okay
he
better
keep
his
parts
to
himself
they
stop
at
the
end
of
a
row
of
display
cases
and
buffy
notices
rodney
scraping
a
mask
what's
he
doing
uh
that's
rodney
munson
he's
god's
gift
to
the
bell
curve
another
student
goes
up
to
rodney
and
gets
growled
at
what
he
lacks
in
smarts
he
makes
up
in
lack
of
smarts
you
just
don't
like
him
'cause
of
that
time
he
beat
you
up
every
day
for
five
years
buffy
giggles
to
herself
yeah
i'm
irrational
that
way
buffy
smiles
i
better
stop
him
before
he
gets
in
trouble
i
got
it
the
nonviolent
approach
is
probably
better
here
willow
goes
over
to
rodney
i
wasn't
gonna
use
violence
i
don't
always
use
violence
buffy
looks
up
at
xander
do
i
the
important
thing
is
you
believe
that
cut
to
rodney
he's
still
scraping
the
mask
what're
you
rodney
looks
up
oh
willow
hi
that's
probably
not
something
you're
supposed
to
be
doing
you
could
get
in
trouble
rodney
facetiously
oh
no
and
they
might
kick
me
outta
school
willow
smiles
are
we
still
on
for
our
chem
tutorial
tomorrow
yeah
i
think
i
got
almost
all
fourteen
natural
elements
memorized
there're
a
hundred
and
three
rodney
suddenly
looks
worried
cut
to
the
museum

a
platform
where
the

with
'and
she
lived
happily
ever
after'
xander
willow
looks
into
the
coffin
no
i
think
it
ends
with
'and

scary
discolored
shriveled
mummy'
guide
the
incan
people
sacrificed
their
princess
to
the
mountain
god
sebancaya
an
offering
buried
alive
for
eternity
in
this
dark
tomb
they
could've
at
least
wrapped
her
in
those
nice
white
bandages
like
in
the
movies
the
princess
remained
there
protected
only
by
a
cursed
seal
placed
there
guide
points
to
the
plate
in
the
mummy's
hands
as
a
warning
to
any
who
would
wake

better
way

the
stench
of
urine

way

the
guide
to
the
next
destination
on
the
tour
cut
to
later
the

deserted
now
except
for
rodney
who
cautiously
looks
around
and
makes
his
way
back
up
to
the
mummy
he
looks
into
the
stone
coffin
and
sees
the
plate
with
the
seal
aha
cool
he
reaches
in
and
yanks
at
the
plate
trying
to
wrest
it
from
the
mummy's
grip
he
gets
it
out
of
one
hand
and
yanks
it
hard
to
get
it
out
of
the
other
it
comes
loose
and
he
pulls
it
up
too
fast
breaking
it
against
the
side
of
the
coffin
oh
damn
he
reaches
in
to
collect
the
pieces
the
mummy's
arms
reach
up
and
grab
him
by
the
neck
its
eyelids
open
to
reveal
empty
sockets
as
it
pulls
him
in
closer

sunnydale
high
students
are
arriving
for
school
cut
to
the
library
buffy
and
giles
are
training
xander
is
studying
at
the
table
so
can
i
go
i
think
not
buffy
lands
four
hard
hits
on
the
training
pad
giles
is
holding
he
flinches
at
her
blows
and
after
she's
done
puts
the
pad
down
in
favor
of
a
much
thicker
one
buffy
pouts
how
come
because
you
are
the
chosen
one
mm
just
this
once
i'd
like
to
be
the
overlooked
one
well
i'm
afraid
that
is
not
buffy
kicks
the
pad
hard
making
giles
stagger
back
a
few
steps
you
have
responsibilities
that
other
girls
do
not
oh
i
know
this
one
slaying
entails
certain
sacrifices
blah
blah
bity
blah
i'm
so
stuffy
gimme
a
scone
giles
sarcastically
it's
as
if
you
know
me
buffy
continues
kicking
xander
winces
at
each
blow
your
secret
identity
is
gonna
be
difficult
enough
to
maintain
while
this
exchange
student
is
living
with
you
xander
gets
up
and
separates
them
nooot
with
her
in
the
same
house
as
her
am
i
the
only
one
who's
objective
enough
to
make
that
distinction
xander
goes
to
the
counter
so
i
think
going
to
the
dance
like
a
normal
person
would
be
the
best
way
to
keep
that
secret
giles
come
on
budge
no
one
likes
a
non
budger
giles
doesn't
say
a
word
she
steps
back
and
comes
at
him
for
an
especially
hard
kick
fine
buffy
stops
her
kick
at
the
last
instant
go
buffy
smiles
yay
i
win
i'll
just
go
and
introduce
my
shoulder
to
a
an
icepack
xander
hops
off
of
the
counter
so
i
guess
we're
dancebound
cool
i
think
i
can
get
my
mom's
car
so
i'm
wheel
man
i
thought
you
were
taking
willow
well
yeah
i'm
gonna
take
willow
but
i'm
not
gonna
take
willow
in
the
sense
of
'take
me'
see
with
you
we're
three
and
everybody's
safe
without
you
we're
two
ah
and
we
enter
dateville
romance
flowers
lips
willow
comes
into
the
library
but
xander's
back
is
to
the
door
so
he
doesn't
see
her
buffy
pretends
not
to
notice
her
oh
come
on
in
all
the
years
you've
know
willow
you've
never
thought
about
her
lips
buffy
i
love
willow
willow
smiles
widely
and
she's
my
best
friend
which
makes
her
not
the
kind
of
girl
who
i
think
about
her
lips
that
much
willow's
smile
fades
to
disappointment
she's
the
kind
of
girl
that
i'm
best
friends
with
hey
guys
willow
xander
goes
to
her
hi
we
were
just
talkin'
about
happy
things
he
puts
his
arm
around
her
and
pulls
her
over
to
buffy
at
the
table
like
the
three
of
us
going
to
the
dance
together
see
xander
laughs
happy
willow
isn't
smiling
not
happy
no
uh
oh
yyes
no
rodney's
missing
giles
comes
out
of
his
office
with
an
ice
pack
trouble
with
mr
munson
again
giles
puts
it
on
his
shoulder
his
parents
say
he
never
came
home
last
night
y'know
i
don't
think
i
remember
seeing
rodney
on
the
bus
back
from
the
field
trip
i
didn't
either
i
hope
he
didn't
get
in
trouble
at
the
museum
xander
chuckles
hey
maybe
he
awakened
the
mummy
willow
giggles
right
and
it
rose
from
its
tomb
buffy
smiles
and
attacked
him
buffy
nods
their
smiles
fade
as
they
all
realize
that
that
may
not
be
so
far
fetched
cut
to
the
inca
exhibit
at
the
museum
they
all
come
walking
in
on
the
other
hand
maybe
rodney
just
stepped
out
for
a
smoke
for
twentyone
hours
it's
addictive
you
know
we'll
deal
with
that
when
we've
ruled
out
evil
curses
they
climb
the
steps
to
the
platform
where
the
coffin
is
on
display
one
day
i'm
gonna
live
in
a
town
where
evil
curses
are
just
generally
ruled
out
without
even
saying
there
was
a
seal
buffy
steps
up
to
the
coffin
and
looks
in
it
was
right
here
and
it's
broken
buffy
picks
up
the
largest
piece
does
that
mean
the
mummy's
loose
no
comfy
as
ever
buffy
hands
the
piece
to
giles
look
at
this
series
of
pictograms
a
man
comes
out
of
nowhere
and
yells
jumps
up
behind
xander
and
swings
at
him
with
a
knife
xander
ducks
the
blow
and
gets
behind
him
the
man
swings
back
the
other
way
again
blindly
looks
into
the
coffin
and
is
surprised
by
what
he
sees
there
xander
jumps
onto
the
man's
back
he
knocks
xander
off
and
runs
off
of
the
platform
and
away
xander
quickly
gets
up
okay
i
just
saved
us
right
something
did
well
we'll
fret
about
the
details
later
let's
just
get
out
of
here
before
he
comes
back
they
all
hurry
down
the
steps
to
leave
except
willow
who's
noticed
something
about
the
mummy
giles
were
the
incas
very
advanced
yes
yes
very
did
they
have
orthodontists
cut
to
the
mummy
there
are
metal
braces
on
its
teeth
cut
to
the
library
they
all
come
in
rodney
looked
like
he
had
been
dead
for
five
hundred
years
how
could
that
be
maybe
we
should
ask
that
crazy
man
with
the
big
old
knife
i
don't
think
he
seemed
overly
chatty
the
way
he
bolted
when
he
saw
rodney
i'd
say
he
was
as
freaked
as
we
were
my
resources
on
this
subject
are
extremely
limited
ii
gather
that
this
particular
mummy
was
from
the
sebancaya
region
of
eastern
peru
it's
very
remote
now
if
there's
an
answer
then
it's
it's
locked
in
the
in
the
seal
giles
looks
at
the
seal
it's
gonna
take
me
weeks
to
translate
these
pictograms
well
we'll
start
tonight
with
ampata
i
was
gonna
suggest
hunting
no
i'm
late
i
told
my
mom
i'd
pick
him
up
uhuhuh
buffy
where
are
your
priorities
tracking
down
a
mummifying
killer
or
making
time
for
some
latin
lover
whose
stock
in
trade
is
the
breakage
of
hearts
ampata's
there
alone
and
ii
don't
know
how
good
his
english
is
he's
here
from
south
a
south
america
hey
y'know
maybe
he
could
translate
the
seal
oh
yeah
fall
for
the
old
'let
me
translate
that
ancient
seal
for
ya'
come
on
tsh
d'ya
know
how
many
times
i've
used
that
cut
to
the
bus
stations
ampata
is
standing
there
alone
waiting
and
looking
around
for
his
ride
he
hears
a
whisper
ampata
he
starts
walking
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
passing
several
parked
busses
he
hears
the
voice
again
louder
this
time
ampata
he
walks
between
two
busses
looking
around
for
whoever
it
is
hello
he
sees
the
mummy
come
toward
him
and
is
surprised
and
frightened
but
doesn't
scream
or
yell
the
mummy
reaches
out
grabs
him
by
the
neck
pulls
him
in
and
kisses
him
ampata
begins
to
shrivel
and
dry
up
as
the
mummy
draws
his
life
force
from
him
cut
to
later
buffy
willow
and
xander
arrive
at
the
bus
station
and
look
for
him
forty
minutes
late
welcome
to
america
what
if
he
left
already
willow
finds
the
door
to
the
station
building
locked
buffy
calls
out
ampata
ampata
gutierrez
so
do
we
have
to
speak
spanish
when
we
see
him
'cause
i
don't

ampata
here
the
mummy
had
regained
her
appearance
of
a
young
teenage
girl
she
comes
walking
out
from
between
two
busses
hello

instantly
taken
with
her
beauty

over
to
oz

a
wonderland
tour
you
gotta
admit
the
girl
is
hot
yeah
she's
a
hot
girl
let
me
guess
not
your
type
what
does
a
girl
have
to
do
to
impress
you
well
it
involves
a
feathered
boa
and
a
theme
to
'a
summer
place'
i
can't
discuss
it
here
you're
too
picky
man
do
you
know
how
many
girls
you
could
have
you're
lead
guitar
oz
it's
currency
i'm
not
picky
you're
just
impressed
by
any
pretty
girl
that
can
walk
and
talk
she
doesn't
have
to
talk
oz
just
smirks
cut
to
willow
and
xander
walking
i
worked
really
hard
on
my
costume
it's
pretty
cool
okay
but
what
about
me
i've
gotta
think
well
it's
a
celebration
of
cultures
there
are
lots
of
dress
up
alternatives
and
a
corresponding
equal
number
of
mocking
alternatives
all
aimed
at
me
bavarians
are
cool
okay
no
shirts
with
ruffles
no
hats
with
feathers
and
definitely
no
lederhosen
they
make
my
calves
look
fat
why
are
you
suddenly
so
worried
about
looking
like
an
idiot
that
came
out
wrong
xander
didn't
take
offense
because
he's
too
busy
looking
at
buffy
and
ampata
arriving
for
school
willow
notices
and
looks
also
cut
to
buffy
and
ampata
your
first
day
of
school
nervous
it
is
just
more
people
than
i
have
seen
in
a
long
time
ah
don't
worry
you
will
have
no
problems
making
friends
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
know
someone
who's
dying
to
meet
you
cut
to
the
library
giles
gets
right
to
it
giles
shakes
her
hand
smiles
how
do
you

was
i
was
wondering
if
you
could
um
translate
this
giles
shows
her
the
seal
that
was
in
no
way
awkward
ampata
takes
it
and
looks
at
it
in
disbelief
something
wrong
uh
no
uh
it
is
uh
why
are
you
asking
me
well
uh
uh
giles
coughs
it's
well
it's
an
artifact
from
from
uh
your
region
iit's
uh
from
the
tomb
of
aan
incan
mummy
aaactually
we
were
trying
to
translate
it
uh
um
as
aa
project
for
our
um
our
archeology
club
giles
impressed
with
her
quick
thinking
very
good
it
is
broken
where
are
the
other
pieces
that's
all
we
found
hmm
it
is
very
old
and
valuable
ampata
to
giles
holding
the
seal
out
to
him
you
should
hide
it
is
is
uh
anything
you
recognize
here
um
um
this
this
um
this
chchap
here
with
the
knife
for
instance
well
ii
do
not
know
exactly
but
iii
think
this
represents
i
believe
the
word
is
'bodyguard'
giles
takes
the
seal
bodyguard
interesting
legend
has
it
that
he
guards
the
mummy
against
those
who
would
disturb
her
well
uh
yes
well
that's
um
that's
a
very
good
starting
point
for
our
um
club
giles
looks
at
buffy
um
oh
and
uh
aas
club
president
i
have
um
lots
to
do
lots
of
stuff
dull
stuff
uh
oh
willow
maybe
you
could
stay
with
ampata
for
the
day
i'd
love
to
xander
bows
slightly
and
smiles
ampata
smiles
yes
that
will
be
fun
xander
gestures
for
ampata
to
go
ahead
of
him
as
she
walks
out
he
turns
to
buffy
and
willow
lets
out
a
breath
and
follows
her
willow
watches
them
go
right
i'll
uh
continue
with
the
translation
buffy
you
research
this
uh
bodyguard
thing
and
uh
willow
giles
turns
around
willow
willow
still
staring
after
them
boy
they
really
like
each
other
cut
to
the
bleachers
on
the
football
field
xander
and
ampata
are
sitting
about
twothirds
of
the
way
up
and
this
xander
reaches
into
his
satchel
is
called
a
snack
food
xander
holds
up
a
twinkie
snack
food
yeah
it's
a
delicious
spongy
golden
cake
stuffed
with
a
delightful
creamy
white
substance
of
goodness
and
here's
how
you
eat
it
he
stuffs
the
whole
thing
into
his
mouth
ampata
laughs
at
the
sight
mmhm
oh
but
now
i
cannot
try
it
xander
with
a
full
mouth
that's
why
you
bring
two
he
produces
another
one
from
his
bag
and
hands
it
to
her
oh
ampata
studies
it
here
goes
she
pulls
her
windswept
hair
back
from
her
face
and
proceeds
to
stuff
most
of
the
twinkie
into
her
mouth
she
laughs
with
delight
xander
mouth
still
full
good
huh
and
the
exciting
part
is
that
they
have
no
ingredients
that
a
human
can
pronounce
so
it
doesn't
leave
you
with
that
heavy
food
feeling
in
your
stomach
she
squeals
with
laughter
ampata
mouth
full
you
are
strange
girls
always
tell
me
that
right
before
they
run
away
i
like
it
i
like
you
like
it
she
can't
help
but
laugh
more
at
that
please
don't
learn
from
my
english
cut
to
the
library
buffy
is
inspecting
the
seal
under
a
magnifying
lamp
ha
or
possible
ha
buffy
to
willow
do
you
think
this
matches
willow
is
off
in
her
own
world
idly
playing
with
her
stuffed
frog
hey
oh
yes
i'm
caring
about
mummies
ampata's
only
staying
two
weeks
yeah
and
then
xander
can
find
someone
else
who's
not
me
to
obsess
about
at
least
with
you
i
knew
he
didn't
have
a
shot
well
you
know
i
have
a
choice
i
can
spend
my
life
waiting
for
xander
to
go
out
with
every
other
girl
in
the
world
until
he
notices
me
or
i
can
just
get
on
with
my
life
good
for
you
well
i
didn't
choose
yet
giles
inspecting
the
seal
good
lord
giles
to
buffy
good
work
my
work
yes
this
is
most
illuminating
it
seems
rodney's
killer
might
be
the
mummy
where
does
it
say
that
well
here
it
implies
that
the
mummy
is
capable
of
feeding
on
the
life
force
of
a
person
effectively
freezedrying
them
you
might
say
extraordinary
so
then
we
just
have
to
stop
the
mummy
which
leads
to
the
question
how
do
we
a
find
and
b
stop
the
mummy
well
the
answer
to
that
is
somewhere
still
in
here
or
in
the
rest
of
the
seal
cut
outside
to
the
bleachers
the
bodyguard
attacks
xander
with
his
large
knife
ampata
screams
as
she
and
xander
quickly
move
apart
and
the
knife
hits
the
seat
between
them
you
stole
the
seal
where
is
it
he
swings
again
but
xander
scoots
back
more
and
then
rolls
down
two
levels
of
seats
the
bodyguard
comes
at
him
again
and
tries
to
stab
him
but
xander
catches
his
arm
and
stops
him
ampata
screams
again
the
bodyguard
looks
back
at
her
and
recognizes
her
it
is
you
xander
kicks
him
off
and
he
rolls
down
the
bleachers
and
to
the
ground
ampata
grabs
xander's
satchel
helps
him
up
and
they
run
away
cut
to
the
library
giles
comes
out
of
his
office
with
a
cup
of
tea
and
sets
it
on
the
table
in
front
of
ampata
here
you
are
thank
you
why's
this
guy
so
into
us
i
mean
what's
he
want
he
said
'give
me
the
seal'
giles
apparently
this
is
more
popular
than
we
realized
i
just
don't
know
what
we
we
should
do
with
it
destroy
it
ampata
gets
a
surprised
look
from
giles
if
you
do
not
someone
could
die
i'm
afraid
someone
already
has
you
mean
the
man
with
the
knife
killed
someone
uh
no
well
not
exactly
you
are
not
telling
me
everything
ampata
looks
at
them
all
you're
right
ampata
xander
takes
her
hand
and
it's
time
we
do
we're
not
an
archeology
club
we're
in
uh
giles
interrupts
by
clearing
his
throat
buffy
gives
him
a
stern
look
we're
in
the
crime
club
which
is
kinda
like
the
chess
club
only
with
crime
and
um
no
chess
please
understand
me
that
seal
nearly
got
us
killed
it
must
be
destroyed
she
gets
up
and
runs
from
the
library
a
moment
later
xander
gets
up
and
runs
out
after
her
ampata
buffy
and
willow
look
at
each
other
a
bit
surprised
and
confused
cut
to
the
hall
ampata
is
sitting
on
a
bench
xander
crouches
down
beside
her
ampata
listen
to
me
nobody's
gonna
hurt
you
i
won't
let
them
your
investigation
is
dangerous
i
do
not
want
that
just
normal
life
she
gets
up
and
goes
over
to
the
drinking
fountain
xander
stands
back
up
and
follows
her
but
stays
back
and
lets
her
drink
willow
comes
out
of
the
library
is
she
okay
wigged
i'm
tryin'
to
convince
her
that
our
lives
aren't
just
danger
and
peril
around
here
willow
looks
over
at
ampata
sympathetically
then
back
to
xander
you
should
take
her
to
the
dance
that's
a
good
idea
we'll
all
go
no
i
mean
just
you
but
you
were
psyched
and
your
costume
i'll
see
you
there
you
know
what
willow
you're
my
best
friend
he
goes
over
to
ampata
i
know
willow
walks
off
cut
to
the
library
i
don't
get
it
why
would
the
bodyguard
have
such
a
jones
for
a
broken
piece
of
rock
well
um
perhaps
he
needs
to
put
it
together
with
the
other
pieces
if
he
has
them
i
mean
we
didn't
find
them
and
if
he
didn't
then
then
they'd
still
be
at
the
museum
so
maybe
we
should
go
there
and
find
them
and
odds
are
he'll
show
up
too
right
and
hopefully
we'll
be
ready
hey
look
at
us
we
came
up
with
a
plan

go

the
dance
ampata
laughs
why

that
so
scary
well
because
you
never
know
if
a
girl's
gonna
say
'yes'
or
if
she's
gonna
laugh
in
your
face
and
pull
out
your
still
beating
heart
and
crush
it
into
the
ground
with
her

her
that
she

that
only
she
could
defend
her
people
from
the
nether
world
buffy
pulls

a
pair
of
boy's
briefs
and
looks
at

in
confusion
out
of
all
the
girls
in
her
generation
buffy
looks
over
at

ampata
looks
around

sees
willow
in

her
and
leads
ampata
over

where's
buffy

her
hollowed

for
giles
thank
heavens

yup
not
at
the
dance
not
with
my
friends
not
with

thought
we
were
gonna
meet
at
the
museum
to
find
the
bodyguard
no
he's
already
been
found
in
a
school
restroom
mummified
okay
i
don't
get
it
why
would
the
mummy
kill
her
own
bodyguard
well
i've
crossreferenced
and
uh
i've
looked
at
the
pictograms
anew
he
was
a
guard
alright
but
it
was
his
job
to
insure
that
the
mummy
didn't
awaken
and
escape
so
ampata
translated
wrong
perhaps
hold
on
a
sec
she
was
wiggy
about
the
seal
from
minute
one
yes
i
suppose
she
was
her

beg
your
pardon
cut
to
buffy's
room
giles
goes
through
ampata's

would
a
girl
pack
these
buffy
tears

the
lock
on
the
trunk
and
lifts
the
lid
how
'bout
this
one

buffy
shakes
her
head
cut
to
the
dance
floor
xander
is
looking

eyes
as
they
slow
dance

outta
time
all
it
takes
is
living
i
want
to
fly
ampata
leans
her
head
onto
his
cheek
for
a
moment
i've
never
known

she
pulls
her
head
back
and
looks
back
into
xander's
eyes
i've
never
known
your

quickly
takes
her
arms
off
of
his

and
rushes
off
xander
stares
after
her
thoroughly
confused
okay

i
can
rule
out
something
i
said
someone
take
me
home

me
outta
here
ampata
reaches
the
edge
of
the
crowd
and
looks
round
she
sees
jonathon
sitting
alone
on
the
stairs
cut
to
giles'
car
i
should've
guessed
remember
ampata
wanted
us
to
hide
the
seal
and
then
she
wanted
us
to
destroy
it
becau
oh
wait
uh
waiting
well
we
already
know
that
the
seal
was
used
to
contain
the
mummy
if
breaking
it
freed
her
reassembling
it
will
trap
her
i'll
go
to
the
museum
i'll
drop
you
off
i'll
try
to
piece
together
the
fragments
there

xander

xander
laughs

those
tears
of

away
to

she
nods
and
if
you
told
me
you'd
have
to
kill
me
xander
smiles
she
doesn't
think
it's
funny
and
hugs
him
again
crying
even
harder
oh

was
a
bad
joke
and
the
delivery
was
off
too
i'm
sorry
xander
pushes
her
away
again
i
uh
he
strokes
her
hair
and
face
gently
i'm
sorry

gently
yet
tentatively
she
reaches
her
arm
around
his
head
and
pulls
him
closer
for
a
harder
kiss
