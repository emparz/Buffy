prologue

the
sunnydale
cemetery
at
night
the
camera
fades
in
on
a
gravestone
andrew
hoelich
19811998and
slowly
pans
down
to
the
ground
in
front
of
it
a
bouquet
of
fresh
flowers
is
there
a
hand
comes
out
of
the
freshly
filled
grave
and
claws
for
solid
ground
slowly
andrew
pulls
himself
out
of
his
grave
now
a
newly
made
vampire
he
growls
when
his
head
clears
the
earth
and
continues
to
climb
out
on
his
stomach
he
crawls
along
the
ground
pulling
out
his
legs
as
the
camera
pulls
back
and
stops
when
he
sees
a
pair
of
widespread
legs
standing
before
him
he
looks
up
to
see
who
it
is
that's
right
big
boy
cut
to
willow
willow
smiles
mischievously
come
and
get
it
andrew
suddenly
hops
to
his
feet
and
roars
at
her
taken
aback
by
this
willow
takes
a
few
quick
steps
backward
the
vampire
takes
two
steps
toward
her
xander
grabs
him
by
the
collar
of
his
suit
and
pulls
him
back
away
from
willow
andrew
loses
his
balance
in
the
process
i
got
him
go
oz
jumps
out
from
behind
a
bush
and
starts
to
run
toward
them
but
then
hesitates
a
moment
to
get
a
stake
from
his
jacket
pocket
any
time
now

andrew
has
regained
his
balance
and
using
xander's
grip
to
stabilize
himself
kicks
up
with
both
legs
and
does
a
double
pike
snapping
kick
to
oz's
face
oz
stumbles
backward
and
falls
without
pausing
andrew
leaps
up
again
and
does
a
back
tuck
over
xander's
head
xander
tries
to
rush
him
but
andrew
uses
his
momentum
to
deflect
him
into
willow
they
both
go
crashing
to
the
ground
willow
moans
but
quickly
sits
up
to
watch
andrew
run
away
he's
getting
away
and
ow
oz
scrambles
to
his
feet
and
picks
up
his
stake
he
watches
the
demon
running
and
holds
his
stake
by
the
tip
preparing
to
throw
it
like
a
knife
andrew
leaps
over
a
rock
and
continues
running
oz
throws
the
stake
it
whistles
through
the
air
as
it
flies
end
over
end
and
hits
a
gravestone
bouncing
off
of
it
with
a
loud
thunk
and
flying
wild
oz
shaking
his
head
that
really
never
works
willow
and
xander
get
up
and
oz
turns
to
them
are
you
guys
all
right
first
of
all
what
was
with
the
acrobatics
how
did
that
happen
oz
looking
in
the
direction
that
andrew
went
wasn't
andy
hoelich
on
the
gymnastics
team
xander
gestures
with
his
arm
that's
right
he
was
xander
shouting
after
andrew
cheater
oz
gives
xander
a
brief
look
and
then
stares
into
the
distance
again
looking
for
andrew
xander
to
willow
okay
and
the
uh
second
problem
i'm
having

'come
and
get
it
big
boy'
well

willow
stammering
wwell
the
slayer
always
says
a
pun
oror
a
witty
play
on
words
and
i
think
it
throws
the
vampires
off
and
and
it
makes
them
frightened
because
i'm
wisecracking
okay
i
didn't
really
have
a
chance
to
work
on
that
one
but
you
try
it
every
time
uh
if
i
may
suggest
'this
time
it's
personal'
i
mean
there's
a
reason
why
it's
a
classic
xander
steps
away
i've
always
been
amazed
with
how
buffy
fought
but

xander
picks
up
his
bag
in
a
way
i
feel
like
we
took
her
punning
for
granted
xander
steps
back
willow
gives
xander
a
scolding
look
xander
past
tense
rule
oh
sorry
i
just
meant
we
in
the
past
took
it
for
granted
and
uh
we
won't
when
she
gets
back
do
you
think
buffy
knows
school's
starting
tomorrow
tomorrow
oz
willow
looks
at
him
right
big
day
willow
goes
to
oz
oh
i'm
gonna
be
busy
a
lot
but
but
only
till
3
and
that's
when
you
usually
get
up
i
can't
wait
to
see
cordelia
xander
pauses
i
can't
believe
i
can't
wait
to
see
cordelia
willow
smiling
i
wonder
what
our
first
homework
assignment's
gonna
be
xander
puts
his
hands
on
his
hips
and
gives
her
a
look
hey
you're
excited
over
cordelia
okay
we've
all
got
issues
i
guess
we
should
pack
it
in
yeah
they
all
start
to
walk
away
from
andrew's
grave
wouldn't
it
be
great
if
buffy
just
showed
up
tomorrow
like
nothing
happened
she
can't
just
show
up
she
got
kicked
out
well
yeah
ii
know
i
just
wish
i
wish
we
knew
where
she
was
cut
to
a
los
angeles
beach
a
wave
crashes
on
the
sand
in
the
far
distance
a
pier
stretches
out
into
the
water
buffy
steps
into
view
walking
barefoot
across
the
sand
she
stops
and
looks
out
over
the
ocean
she
closes
her
eyes
and
raises
her
head
to
just
feel
the
sun
on
her
face
and
listen
to
the
waves
come
in
the
camera
pans
down
from
her
face
to
her
waist
a
pair
of
hands
reach
around
her
and
clasp
in
front
and
she
covers
them
with
hers
the
camera
pans
back
up
to
her
face
she
looks
back
at
angel
leaning
his
head
over
her
shoulder
she
reaches
up
with
her
hand
and
brushes
it
against
his
cheek
how
did
you
find
me
here
if
i
was
blind
i
would
see
you
she
lowers
her
hand
to
take
his
again
at
her
waist
and
closes
her
eyes
she
embraces
his
arms
tightly
to
her
stay
with
me
forever
that's
the
whole
point
i'll
never
leave
angel
whispering
into
her
ear
not
even
if
you
kill
me
buffy's
expression
turns
from
contented
to
dismayed
cut
to
buffy's
tiny
apartment
in
a
rundown
downtown
los
angeles
neighborhood
she
wakes
from
her
dream
and
looks
around
sadly
slowly
she
gets
up
and
goes
over
to
the
window
overlooking
the
street
below
the
camera
pans
away
from
the
window
past
the
sidewalk
and
into
the
street
a
police
siren
gets
louder
as
it
nears
and
an
instant
later
an
lapd
squad
car
races
across
the
intersection
at
the
end
of
the
block
against
the
red
light
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

behind
the
counter
at
a
small
sleazy
diner
named
helen's
kitchen
the
cook
puts
two
burgers
with
fries
up
on
the
pickup
counter
a
waitress
walks
past
the
counter
to
hang
an
order
on
the
spinner
buffy
walks
behind
her
to
pick
up
the
two
burgers
she
has
her
hair
in
two
short
braids
to
keep
it
out
of
the
way
her
expression
emotes
a
combination
of
sadness
and
boredom
she
takes
the
two
plates
walks
them
over
to
a
nearby
table
and
sets
them
down
in
front
of
two
roughneck
types
they
both
eye
her
lecherously
buffy
takes
out
her
order
pad
anything
else
that'll
do
us
peaches
she
tears
off
their
bill
and
puts
it
on
the
table
pay
at
the
counter
sure
you
don't
want
me
to
work
it
off
for
you
the
other
roughneck
laughs
at
that
buffy
walks
away
and
as
she
goes
he
reaches
out
with
his
hand
and
slaps
her
on
the
behind
buffy
stops
in
her
tracks
the
two
men
just
chuckle
she
turns
her
head
slightly
but
thinks
better
of
doing
anything
about
it
she
walks
up
to
another
table
where
a
young
couple
is
sitting
they
are
too
into
each
other
to
notice
buffy
you
guys
ready
rickie
still
looking
at
his
girl

rickie
looks
at
buffy's
name

'anne'

glances
at
them
briefly
then
looks
down
at
her
pad
to
take
their
order

rickie
reaches
into
his
pocket
and
pulls
out
a
handful
of

rickie
looks
up
at
buffy
as
the
two
of
them
hold
out
their
forearms
hey
check
this
out
buffy
looks
at
their
arms
as
they
hold
them
out
together
and
sees
they
each
have
a
tattoo
of
half
of
a
heart
with
a
ribbon
across
it
on
their
respective
halves
of
the
ribbon

have
the
other's

and
uh
permanent
buffy
smiles
weakly
rickie
looking
at
lily
yeah
forever
rickie
puts
his
arm
around
lily
i
mean
that's
the
whole
point
lily
looks
at
him
and
smiles
buffy
looks
down
sadly
a
moment
later
she
looks
up
at
lily
and
there's
a
spark
of
recognition
in
her
face
lily
looks
up
at
buffy
and
thinks
she
also
recognizes
her
hey
do
i
know
you
buffy
looks
away

don't
think
so
lily
looks
harder

avoids
the
issue
i'll
get
your
pie
lily
watches
as
buffy
goes
to
the
cash
register
rickie
distracts
her
and
they
are
in
their
own
little
world
again
at
the
register
buffy
puts
down
the
order
the
other
waitress
looks
at
her
i'm
not
feeling

buffy
unties
her
apron

can
cover
for
me
sure
waitress
looks
at
the
order
okay
buffy
gives
rickie
and
lily
one
last
look
and
goes
out
of
the
diner
cut
to
the
sunnydale
high
school
library
students
are
busy
looking
for
books
they
will
need
during
the
semester
willow
and
giles
walk
out
of
the
stacks
on
the
mezzanine
level
willow
has
several
books
in
her
arms
so
no
joy
at
the
cemetery
they
come
down
the
stairs
no
he
got
away
we
still
have
some
glitches
in
the
system
like
vampires
getting
away
but
i
think
we're
improving
willow
smiles
they
split
up
as
giles
heads
through
the
door
to
go
behind
the
checkout
counter
for
god's
sake
be
careful
giles
they
meet
at
the
counter
i
mean
uh
i
appreciate
your
efforts
to
keep
the
vampire
population
down
until
buffy
returns
but
uh
well
if
anything
should
happen
to
you
and
you
should
be
killed
i
should
take
it
somewhat
amiss
giles
scans
willow's
books
to
check
them
out
you'd
be
cranky
entirely
well
we
try
not
to
get
killed
willow
the
phone
in
giles'
office
rings
that's
part
of
our
whole
mission
statement
'don't
get
killed'
she
takes
the
books
and
stacks
them
together
again
good
good
giles
taps
on
one
of
her
books
i
think
you're
going
to
love
that
one
giles
goes
to
get
the
phone
willow
picks
the
books
up
and
starts
out
of
the
library
before
she
can
take
more
than
a
few
steps
cordelia
comes
up
to
her

hides
her
face
from
the

pulling
her

sad

and
buffy
gives
her
a
surprised
look

i
just

i
know
this
guy
he's
gonna

of
i

too
much
lily
crosses
her
arms
and
looks
very
disappointed
buffy
looks
down
and
starts
to
dig
through
her
purse
ii
do
have
the
money
though
so
why
don't
you
and
rickie
go
and
then
maybe
i
could
meet
you
some
other
time
lily
raises
her
hands
and
waves
off
the
offer
no
it's
okay
it's
okay
forget
about
it
just
a
homeless
man
rudely
pushes
his
way
between
them
the
two
girls
both
stare
after
him
that's
not
very
polite
the
man
turns
around
and
looks
blankly
back
at
them
are
you
okay
i'm
no
one
he
turns
back
around
and
walks
into
the
traffic
on
the
street
buffy's
eyes
widen
with
concern
the
man
stops
in
the
middle
of
a
lane
in
front
of
an
oncoming
pickup
truck
and
faces
it
arms
stretched
wide
buffy
drops
her
bag
and
rushes
into
the
street
the
pickup
driver
honks
his
horn
and
slams
on
the
brakes
the
truck
starts
to
skid
buffy
pushes
the
man
out
of
the
way
in
time
to
save
him
but
not
in
time
to
avoid
getting
hit
herself
she
gets
hit
hard
in
the
legs
by
the
bumper
her
body
snaps
down
hard
onto
the
hood
of
the
truck
and
she
slides
into
the
windshield
she
bounces
back
and
slides
off
of
the
hood
as
the
truck
screeches
to
a
halt
she
hits
the
pavement
flips
over
backward
and
rolls
to
a
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
street
part
2

the
street
the
driver
quickly
gets
out
of
the
pickup
cab
and
runs
over
to
buffy
lying
in
the
street
but
lily
reaches
her
first
buffy
is
on
her
hands
and
knees
trying
to
get
up
people
from
all
around
come
rushing
into
the
street
are
you
okay
jeez
i
didn't
see
you
he
takes
her
by
the
arms
and
helps
her
up
oh
maybe
maybe
you
shouldn't
move
maybe
you
should
lie
down
buffy
looks
around
nervously
at
all
of
the
people
gathering
no
i'm
fine
somebody
call
an
ambulance
buffy
holds
up
her
hands
to
fend
of
everyone's
help
no
i'm
okay
i
just
i
need
to
go
she
runs
off
apparently
not
the
least
bit
hurt
cut
to
further
down
the
street
buffy
is
walking
at
a
brisk
pace
as
she
goes
around
a
corner
there
she
bumps
into
ken
and
knocks
all
of
his
leaflets
onto
the
sidewalk
whoa
ken
sees
his
leaflets
oh

they
both
crouch
down
to
pick
up
the
papers
where
are
you
running
to
sorry
maybe
i
should
ask
where
are
you
running
from
they've
finished
gathering
up
his
leaflets
and
stand
back
up
ken
takes
a
good
look
at
buffy
you're
pretty
new
around
here
uh
you've
got
the
'look'
though
the
'look'
like
you
had
to
grow
up
way
too
fast
what's
your
name
anne
buffy
pushes
past
him
to
go
hey
um
i'm
ken
here
go
ahead
take
one
of
these
he
holds
out
a
leaflet
and
buffy
looks
at
it
it
reads
come
home
to
family
home
and
has
a
drawing
of
a
house
and
a
silhouette
of
a
man
reaching
out
to
hug
a
child
don't
be
shy
about
stopping
by
i
mean
i
guess
you're
not
starving
but
we're
not
just
interested
in
feeding
the
body
you
might
find
something
you're
missing
buffy
looks
up
at
him
i'm
alright
ken
gives
her
a
look
of
disbelief
then
why
are
you
here
ken
buffy
looks
away
this
is
not
a
good
place
for
a
kid
to
be
you
get
old
fast
here
ken
buffy
looks
up
at
him
knowingly
the
thing
that
drains
the
life
out
of
them
is
despair
i
mean
kids
come
here
and
they
got
nothing
to
go
home
to
and
this
ends
up
being
the
last
stop
for
a
lot
of
them
ken
buffy
looks
down
the
street
shouldn't
have
to
be
that
way
back
to
freedom
by
bellylove
starts
playing
as
several
shots
of
homeless
people
are
shown
ooooooooo
on
my
way
to
freedom
a
woman
alone
in
the
street
a
boy
and
girl
huddling
together
on
the
curb
a
young
boy
begging
from
a
businessman
who
rejects
him
as
he
walks
by
a
woman
with
a
dirty
face
looking
into
the
camera
i
ask
myself
cut
to
the
bronze
bellylove
is
on
stage
performing
their
ballad
why
did
i
come
again
to
find
my
own
way
to
freedom
the
camera
pans
from
above
down
to
the
singer
then
over
to
the
guitar
player
and
the
change
is
gonna
come
i'm
gonna
find
my
way
find
my
way
find
my
way
back
to
freedom
the
camera
pans
around
behind
the
singer
showing
the
people
in
the
club
it's
not

busy
night
xander
is
lounging
on
a

the

cuts
closer
to
xander
and
willow
boy
i'm
glad

night
willow
i
wonder
what

doing
gabbing
to
all
of
her
friends
about
her
passionate
affair

laughing
about
me
thinking
how
she
still
might
have
feelings
about
me
he
glances
over
at
willow
and
sees
her
sadly
raise
her
eyebrows
at
him
oh
it's
possible

talking
about
buffy

possible
the
bronze

and
sits
down
next
to
willow
yeah

getting
a
rhythm
down
we're
losing
half
the
vamps
yeah
but
rhythmically
we
just
need
to
work

up

what
we
need
a
vampire
slayer
next

follows
his
gaze
and
sees

looks
squeamish
as
she
looks
over

with
a
needle

split
up

lose
you
on

they
leave
the
blood
bank
the
nurse
loses
her
friendly
demeanor
as
she
watches
them
go
she
swallows
and
begins
to
look
around
nervously
cut
to
a
street
at
night
cut
to
an
abandoned
building
a
homeless
man
stirs
from
his
sleep
as
he
hears
buffy
come
in
but
goes
back
to
sleep
when
he
sees
it's
not
the
cops
buffy
makes
her
way
through
the
building
being
careful
not
to
step
on
anyone
some
of
them
watch
her
as
she
goes
by
she
walks
slowly
along
a
dark
hall
and
turns
a
corner
she
is
startled
by
a
man
with
his
arms
full
walking
the
other
way
behind
her
she
continues
along
and
soon
notices
an
old
man
lying
on
the
floor
dead
the
same
old
man
that
buffy
earlier
saved
from
the
truck
next
to
his
head
is
an
empty
bottle
of
drain
cleaner
an
apparent
suicide
buffy
kneels
next
to
him
and
feels
for
a
pulse
nothing
she
puts
his
arm
down
and
sees
that
there's
a
tattoo
of
half
a
heart
on
his
forearm
with
a
banner
across
the
heart
and
the
name
lily
tattooed
on
it
buffy
looks
at
the
old
man
confused
rickie
part

buffy's
apartment
lily
is
there
waiting
for
her
to
return
she
finds
buffy's
stuffed
duck
and
picks
it
up
to
stroke
it
buffy
opens
the
door
comes
in
and
closes
it
behind
her
lily
puts
the
duck
down
and
steps
closer
to
buffy
did
you
find
rickie
i
thought
ofwell
he
likes
to
go
to
this
movie
house
you
can
get
in
around
the
back
buffy
lily
interrupting
lily
i
think
he's
dead
lily
very
sad
and
lost
but
he
takes
care
of
me
i'm
sorry
we're
gonna
get
a
place
his
cousin
can
get
him
a
job
at
the
car
wash
lily
there's
buffy
exhales
there's
something
else
buffy
sits
on
the
bed
the
the
person
that
i
found
was
old
hehe
looked
about
eighty
well
that's
not
rickie
i'm
sure
it
was
i
i
don't
know
how
but
it
was
like
something
drained
the
life
out
of
him
do
you
mean
like
a
vampire
no
a
vampire
couldn't
accelerate
the
aging
process
maybe
it
was
something
in
his
blood
buffy
has
a
thought
when
was
the
last
time
you
guys
gave
blood
together
i

stands
up
lily
this
is
something
you're
just
gonna
have
to
deal
with
lily
flustered
but
he
didn't
do
anything

happen
to
him

not
the
point
buffy
lily
calms

bit
these
things
happen
all
the
time
you
can't
just
close
your
eyes
and
hope
that
they're
gonna
go
away

and
stuff
you
could
have
brought
this
with
you
buffy
very
annoyed

it
off
on
me
lily
can't
take
it
she
holds
up
her
hands
to
deny
what
she's
hearing
and
walks
out
of
the
apartment
buffy
sighs
regretting
raising
her
voice
to
lily
cut
to
the
street
lily
stops
walking
and
leans
against
the
iron
gates
pulled
across
a
storefront
ken
comes
up
behind
her
are

lily
shakes
her
head
barely
able
to
keep
from
crying

i
can
help
lily
sniffles

can't
lily
breathes
deeply
look
i
know
you
all
think
i'm
a
big
square
handing
out
leaflets
about

up
a
part
of
you
that's
missing

considers
for
a
moment
ken
smiles
at
her
and
she
nods
in
agreement
he
takes
her
by
the
arm
and
leads
her
away
cut
to
the
blood
bank
a
shadow
appears
on
the
other
side
of
the
frosted
glass
of
the
door
the
camera
pans
down
to
the
doorknob
being
jiggled
suddenly
it
gets
ripped
out
of
the
door
cut
to
a
filing
cabinet
buffy
is
looking
through
it
to
find
rickie's
records
she
grabs
it
and
a
few
others
closes
the
cabinet
and
takes
the
folders
over
to
a
desk
she
turns
on
a
lamp
and
begins
to
go
through
them
first
she
pulls
out
rickie's
and
opens
it
she
scans
his
latest
donation
form
it
looks
normal
except
for
the
word
candidate
in
the
comments
box
candidate
for
what
behind
her
the
nurse
quietly
walks
in
buffy
opens
another
record
and
sees
candidate
again
what
are
you
doing
breaking
into
your
office
and
going
through
your
private
files
buffy
looks
at
another
file
candidate
for
what
i'm
calling
the
police
she
steps
toward
buffy
to
get
to
the
phone
buffy
reaches
over
to
the
phone
and
yanks
it
off
of
the
wall
it
falls
to
the
desk
with
its
wires
torn
now
you've
got
a
whole
bunch
of
candidates
here
i
wonder
if
any
of
them
are
missing
like
rickie
buffy
faces
the
nurse
gosh
i
bet
they
are
you're
getting
yourself
in
a
lot
of
trouble
i
don't
want
any
trouble
i
just
want
to
be
alone
and
quiet
in
a
room
with
a
chair
and
a
fireplace
and
a
tea
cozy
i
don't
even
know
what
a
tea
cozy
is
but
i
want
one
instead

keep
getting
trouble
which
i
am
more
than
willing
to
share
buffy
the
nurse
looks
at
her
nervously
what
are
you
doing
with
these
kids

i
just
i
give
him
the
names
of
the
healthy
ones

at
lily
who
is
wearing
only
a
simple
long
tunic

guess

you
don't
want
to
wear
your
own
outfit

the
cleansing

get
soaked
a
cleansing

like
a
baptism

the
man

to
slam
the
door
closed
but
she
kicks

and
it
slams
into
his
face

she
marches
in
cut
to
ken
and
lily
she
reaches
down
to
the
black
water
in
the
pool
for
a
moment
she
hesitates
but
then
puts
her
hand
in

thick
and
pitchblack
and
her
hand
disappears
in
it
buffy
swings
open
the
door
banging
it
loudly
into
the
wall
ken
looks
at
her
and
stands
up

a
private
moment

surprised
to
see

there
suddenly
something
grabs

screams
as
she
is
pulled
into
the
pool
and
disappears
into
the
black
slime
buffy
runs
to
help
but
ken
grabs
her
and
chokes
her
with
his
arm
around
her
neck
buffy
grabs
his
arm
and
tries
to
snap
her
body
back
to
make
him
release
her
but
instead
they
just
both
fall
into
the
pool
as
well
cut
to
a
dimly
lit
passageway
buffy
and
ken
fall
out
of
a
black
pool
in
the
ceiling
buffy
briefly
looks
up
at
the
pool
then
looks
around
to
see
where
she
is
she
sees
lily
leaning
against
the
wall
holding
her
head
lily
she
rolls
over
onto
her
hands
and
knees
and
quickly
crawls
over
to
lily
ken
is
faring
worse
apparently
hurt
in
the
fall
lily
in
pain
oh

buffy
looks
up
at
the
pool
in
the
ceiling
the
waves
from
her
fall
through
it
are
beginning
to
dissipate
oh
my
face
buffy
looks
over
at
ken
ow
my
face
he
turns
toward
them
and
begins
to
pull
his
face
and
his
hair
off
do
you
have
any
idea
how
hard
it
is
to
glue
that
thing
on
beneath
his
mask
ken's
face
is
red
and
his
head
is
bald
there
appear
to
be
pieces
of
skin
missing
from
his
forehead
revealing
the
even
redder
flesh
beneath
lily
begins
to
panic
buffy
starts
to
get
to
her
feet
and
tries
to
pull
lily
up
with
her
ken
stands
up

buffy
takes
lily's
hand
and
begins
to
run
pulling
her
along
two
guards

up
their
faces

even
more
mangled
and
rawlooking
than

one
of
the
guards
hands
ken
a
club
they
begin
to
pursue
the
girls
buffy
and
lily
run
through
a
maze
of
halls
and
come
out
on
a
ledge
that
overlooks
what
looks
like
a
large
iron
works
there
are
huge
vats
of
molten
metal
sparks
are
flying
through
the
air
from
one
side
and
it
is
hot
and
smoky
buffy
looks
closer
and
in
the
shadows
sees
people
being
used
as
slave
labor
kept
in
line
by
more
guards
with
whips
the
camera
pans
through
the
place
showing
zombielike
humans
pounding
the
metal
on
anvils
pushing
wheelbarrows
from
place
to
place
and
swinging
sledgehammers
some
of
them
cough
hard
as
they
work
the
guards
watch
and
crack
their
whips
every
so
often
ken
comes
up
behind
lily
as
she
takes
in
the
scene
welcome
to
my
world
i
hope
you
like
it
buffy
and
lily
look
back
at
him

hits
buffy
hard
in
the
face
with
his
club
knocking

still
arguing

me
just
ask
you
one
thing
how
long
did
it
take
you
to
forget
me
were
you
still
taxiing
down
the
runway
or
was

actually
in
the
cab

some
hot
little
inca
mummy
girl
yeah
i
heard
about
her
xander
raises
his
finger
at
her
and
is
about
to
respond
when
they
hear
willow
get
tackled
to
the
ground
and
scream
help
their
attention
is
immediately
diverted
to
willow
and
they
begin
to
run
to
her
aid
oz
is
quicker
and
beats
them
there
he
jumps
over
andrew
and
grabs
him
on
the
way
using
his
momentum
to
pull
andrew
off
of
willow
and
then
throw
him
aside
andrew
and
willow
both
quickly
get
to
their
feet
oz
holds
up
his
stake
ready
to
attack
andrew
willow
runs
away
oz
lunges
at
andrew
but
he
just
diverts
oz
to
the
side
and
sends
him
rolling
to
the
ground
next
xander
comes
at
andrew
stake
held
ready
but
andrew
grabs
his
staking
arm
by
the
wrist
with
one
hand
and
his
shoulder
with
the
other
and
they
begin
to
struggle
cordelia
watches
them
struggle
worried
xander
she
decides
to
join
the
fight
and
attacks
andrew
from
behind
pushing
him
and
xander
down
to
the
ground
they
end
up
with
andrew
sandwiched
between
xander
on
the
bottom
and
cordelia
on
the
top
with
cordelia's
weight
on
top
of
him
and
xander's
leverage
against
the
ground
andrew
can't
hold
back
the
stake
any
longer
and
it
plunges
into
his
chest
he
explodes
into
ashes
between
them
and
cordelia
falls
down
on
top
of
xander
the
two
of
them
look
at
each
other
for
an
instant
then

each
other
and
start
kissing
passionately
cut
to
ken's
world
buffy
is
lying
on
the
floor
in
a
cell
lily
is
sitting
on
the
floor
behind
her
leaning
against
a
pillar
buffy
regains
consciousness
rolls
onto
her
side
and
feels
her
head
where
ken
hit
her
no
blood
but
she
is
still
a
bit
dazed
oh
unh

buffy
slowly
sits
up
lily
i
always
knew
i
would
come
here
sooner
or
later
i
knew
i
belonged
here
buffy
looks
around
where
hell
buffy
turns
her
head
toward
lily
this
isn't
hell
ken
appears
at
the
bars
isn't
it
buffy
spins
her
head
around
to
look
at
ken
but
quickly
regrets
moving
it
so
fast
buffy
in
pain
unh

buffy
rubs
her
forehead
what
is
hell
but
the
total
absence
of
hope
the
substance
the
tactile
proof
of
despair
you're
right
lily

is
where
you've
been
heading
all
your
life
just
like
rickie
rickie
he
forgot

long
time

remembered
your
name

forgotten
his
own
but
in
the
end
lily
years
but
ken
oh
uh
interesting
thing

your
reality

hundred
long
years

pass
here
on
earth

just
a
day
so
you
just
work
us
till

plan

die
of
old
age
before
anyone
wonders
where
you
went

will
that's
why
we
chose
you
you
didn't

even
less

a
hood
that
looks
like
it's
made
of
human
skin
sewn
together

chin
and
cheeks
are
exposed
flesh
and
muscle
and
he
has
no
lips
covering
his
teeth
buffy
is
standing

holding
her
head
in
pain

you
thought
whatever
you
were

smiles
buffy
friendly

the
vampire
slayer

the
guard
is
incensed
at
her
insubordination
and
roars
as
he
wields
back
his
club
to
strike
her
he
swings
at
buffy
but
she
sidesteps
him
and
grabs
his
arm
as
he
bends
over
from
his
followthrough
buffy
slams
her
other
forearm
down
on
the
guard's
breaking
it
he
falls
to
the
floor
in
pain
she
picks
up
his
club
and
swings
it
at
another

striking
him
in
the
head

swings
again
the
opposite

at

in

dives
headfirst
for

legs
she
leaps
up
and
pulls
her
legs
up
into
a
tuck
jump
over
him
he
dives
right
underneath
her
buffy
runs
and
jumps
off
of
the
platform
grabbing
a
pole
it
bends
under
her
weight
and
she
rides
it
down
to
the
floor
below
she
begins
to
run
and
the
chase
is
on
again
she
doesn't
get
very
far
when
she
looks
up
and
sees
ken
coming
back
out
onto
the

holding
his
knife
to
lily's
neck
buffy
stops
in
her
tracks
the
guards
chasing

up
and

and
you
all

and
addresses
everyone
in
the
area

cowers
behind
him
ken
seems
to
have
forgotten
that
she's
there
this
is
the
price
of
rebellio
lily
pushes
him
from
behind
and
he
falls
screaming
from
the
high
ledge
to
the
floor
below
the
guards
holding
buffy
just
watch
as
he
hits
bottom
with
a
loud
thud
buffy
gives
lily
a
surprised
look
and
then
quickly
takes
advantage
of
the
distraction
and
backhand
punches
her
captors
one
in
the
face
and
the
other
in
the
groin
while
the
second
one
is
dazed
she
shoves
her
weight
against
him
and
he
falls
backward
onto
a
barrel
the
first
one
punches
high
but
she
blocks
grabs
his
arm
and
flips
him
over
onto
a
pile
of
burlap
sacks
buffy
jumps
up
onto
the
pile
and
steps
across
her
fallen
attacker
he
tries
to
grab
her
but
misses
she
jumps
high
into
the
air
and
grabs
hold
of
a
heavy
chain
hanging
from
above
she
climbs
it
handoverhand
as
quickly
as
she
can
to
the
ledge
where
lily
is
still
standing
the
two
of
them
run
through
the
door
and
quickly
find
their
way
to
the
others
struggling
with
a
heavy
iron
gate
they'll
be
coming
buffy
crouches
down
and
takes
hold
of
the
gate
bracing
herself
for
a
very
heavy
lift
she
begins
to
raise
the
gate
straining
as
she
goes
buffy
grunts
okay
this
works
the
abs
and
the
glutes
buffy
grunts
as
soon
as
she
gets
it
high

waves
to
the
others
to
crawl
underneath

all
scramble
to
the
other
side
i'm
gonna
feel
this
for
a
week
she
holds
the
gate
up
over
her
head
and
squeezes
her
head
and
shoulders
between
two
of
the
bars
to
get
to
the
other
side
suddenly
ken
appears
behind
her
bloodied
from
his
fall
and
tackles
her
to
the
floor
his
club
goes
flying

down
behind
him

up
and
screams
in
pain

rolls
to
a
stop
out
of
his
reach
she
gets
to
her
hands
and
knees
and
looks
over
at
him
as
he
continues
to
scream
in
pain
the
camera
pans
from
his
bloody
face
over
his
back
and
to
his
legs
where
two
of
the
gate's
bars
have
impaled
themselves
through
his
calves
the
slaves
help
each
other
up
through
the
black
slime
of
the
pool
in
the
ceiling
buffy
gets
to
her
feet
and
picks
up

to
the
door

looking
sad
tired
and
disheveled
for
a
long
moment
they
just
look
at
each

without
saying
a
word
then
they
step
toward
each
other
and
hold
each
other
close
for
a
long
tight
embrace
