telling

aand
then
whoosh
all
of
a
sudden
glory's
standing
right
there
in
front
of
us
dawn
we
see
giles
standing
listening
and
buffy
peering
out
through
the
closed
window
blinds
all
skanky
and
blonde
and
thinkin'
she's
all
that
dawn
shot
of
xander
and
anya
sitting
listening
just
'cause
some
bumpy
heads
kiss
her
stinky
feet

pauses
very
quietly
she
does
have
nice
feet
dawn
louder
aand
she's
comin'
right
at
us
and
dawn
shot
of
the
whole
room
willow
and
tara
sitting
on
the
sofa
buffy's
just
standing
there
not
even
blinking
like
bring
it
on
and
then
wham
dawn
smacks
one
fist
into
the
other
hand
hellbitch
in
orbit
go
buff
i
knew
you'd
best
glory
eventually
i
mean
allall
our
years
of
training
buffy
still
staring
out
the
window
a
truck
hit
her
oh
you
threw
it
at
her
well
no
she
more
kind
of
waited
for
it
to
hit
glory
uh
but
then
buffy
ran
really
fast
and
we
got
away
dawn
shot
of
willow
and
tara
on
the
sofa
tara
still
stares
blankly
at
dawn
i
don't
know
how
we
got
away
that
truck
couldn't
have
slowed
her
down
for
more
than
a
second
well
how
isn't
important
all
that
matters
is
that
the
two
of
you
are
safe
buffy
scoffs
turns
to
look
at
him
safe
buffy
angrily
we've
barely
been
able
to
manage
not
getting
seriously
dead
every
time
we've
crossed
paths
with
glory
now
that
she
knows
that
dawn
is
the
key
giles
and
dawn
look
chastised
there
must
be
something
in
the
book
of
tarnis
that
we've
missed
something
we
can
use
against
glory
buffy
turns
to
look
out
the
window
again
piano
because
that's
what
we
used
to
kill
that
big
demon
that
one
time
buffy
turns
to
look
at
them
with
a
confused
frown
no
wait
thatthat
was
a
rocket
launcher
xander
turns
to
anya
ahn
what
are
you
talking
about
we
should
drop
a
piano
on
her
well
it
always
works
for
that
creepy
cartoon
rabbit
when
he's
running
from
that
nice
man
with
the
speech
impediment
giles
rolls
his
eyes
yes
or
perhaps
we
could
paint
a
convincing
tunnel
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
let's
just
keep
thinking
everyone
giles
to
buffy
perhaps
we
should
reassemble
at
the
magic
shop
see
if
there's
anything
we
can't
fight
her
giles
surprised
wwell
not
yet
no
but
no
not
ever
she's
too
strong
giles
we're
not
gonna
win
this
with
with
stakes
or
spells
or
pulling
out
some
uranium
power
core
she's
a
god
and
she's
coming
for
us
so
let's
just
not
be
here
when
she
starts
knocking
run
away
buffy
looks
at
her
finally
a
sensible
plan
that's
not
what
she
meant
xander
to
buffy
is
it
well
we
can't
stay
here
she'll
just
kill
us
off
one
by
one
until
there's
no
one
left
standing
between
her
and
dawn
buffy
we
all
understand
the
severity
of
the
situation
but
there
must
be
another
way
buffy
harshly
no
we
stay
we
die
show
of
hands
for
that
option
everyone
is
silent
all
right
nobody
goes
home
nobody
tells
anybody
we're
leaving
just
pack
up
whatever
supplies
we
need
and
that's
it
we're
gone
dawn
quietly
cool
don't
have
to
study
for
that
geometry
test
xander
quietly
what
about
wheels
i
don't
think
everybody's
gonna
fit
in
the
xandermobile
just
get
your
stuff
together
i'll
handle
the
rest
she
turns
to
look
out
the
window
again
cut
to
glory's
apartment
ben
comes
down
the
stairs
to
the
main
room
wearing
regular
clothes
followed
by
a
minion
gronx
gronx
holds
glory's
dress
and
speaks
with
a
female
voice
although
she
looks
just
like
the
others
this
is
this
is
terrible
i'll
never
be
able
to
mend
this
not
really
my
color
anyway
ben
sits
on
the
arm
of
a
sofa
oh
yes
inappropriate
humor
gronx
fake
laugh
most
amusing
don't
suppose
you
know
what
led
to
this
sartorial
tragedy
that's
not
how
it
works
you
know
that
yes
of
course
i
just
thought
maybe
after
her
magnificent
incandescence
was
returned
to
this
manly
and

gronx
looking
ben
up
and
down
painfully
handsome
assemblage
you
might
have
noticed
something
interesting
a
key
in
human
form
perhaps
lounging
about
unattended
if
i
did
do
you
really
think
i
would
tell
you
why
do
you
insist
on
fighting
the
inevitable
no
one
can
stand
against
her
blindingly
scrumptious
luminescence
glory
her
name
is
glory
and
she's
your
god
you
little
scab
not
mine
with
all
due
respect
andand
fear
of
sharp
objects
you
exist
sir
only
because
of
her
divine
greatness
you
mean
her
divine
failure
don't
you
gronx
squints
angrily
at
him
ben
gets
up
to
pace
i
didn't
ask
for
any
of
this
i
just
want
to
be
normal
we
play
the
hand
we're
dealt
nothing's
mine
is
it
this
life
this
body
it's
all
infected
the
only
thing
i
ever
cared
about
she's
taken
away
from
me
you
know
why
i
wanted
to
be
a
doctor
flattering
drawstring
pants
to
be
close
to
people
to
witness
their
lives
and
their
deaths
to
be
there
alongside
them
a
part
of
everyday
humanity
ben
sighs
maybe
it's
the
drugs
ben
walks
past
drugs
sir
gronx
follows
him
find
the
right
combination
keep
her
buried
where
she
belongs
impossible
her
magnificence
can
never
be
fully
contained
she
is
a
perfect
allencompassing
light
one
you
should
feel
honored
to
be
bathed
in
oh
yeah
i'm
thrilled
especially
with
the
part
where
she
gets
her
key
back
and
i
cease
to
exist
true
this
ohsoappealing
form
will
of
necessity
be
shrugged
off
not
if
i
get
the
key
first
ben
turns
to
leave
but
gronx
stops
him
and
if
you
did
what
then
could
you
do
it
gronx
ben
looks
annoyed
take
a
human
life
with
your
own
hands
gronx
comfortingly
oblivion
is
such
a
small
inconvenience
in
the
service
of
a
deity
accept
your
fate
i
mean
you
said
it
yourself
this
life
was
never
really
yours
anyway
was
it
it
doesn't
matter
how
i
came
by
it
it's
mine

rock
cool
and
collected
in
the
face
of
overwhelming
odds
overwhelming

turns
to
him

much
more
than
whelming
would
that
be
exactly
look
everything
will
be
all
right

just
need
to
stay
here

driving
through

sits
in
the
back
room
leaning
against
the
wall
the

in

back
in
and
gathers
her
nerve

around
you're

a
brisk
pace
quaintly
referred
to
in
some
cultures
as
the
big
scaredy
runaway
dawn
comes
fully
inside
closes
the
door
and
walks
over
to
sit
beside
buffy
it's
the
most
amazing
thing
anyone's
ever
done
for
me
buffy
looks
over
at
her
with
a
pained
expression
then
away
buffy
voice
breaking

just
keeps
coming

dawn
pause
i

but
there's
a
bright
side
there
is
at

get
any
crazier
right
suddenly
they
both
jump
as
an
arrow
shoots
through
the
window
and
lands
in
the
wall
a
little
ways
from
buffy's
head
dawn
stares
at
it
in
horror
buffy
gives
her
an
almost
amused
look
you
know
this
is
your
fault
for
saying
that
dawn
doesn't
seem
to
see
the
humor
buffy
pulls
down
a
corner
of
the
venetian
blinds
to
peek
outside
come

remember
anything
about

shot
of

in

making
a

i'm
not
losing
anyone
spike
sighs
and
shakes
his
head
but
says
nothing
check
the
supplies
see
if
anyone's
hungry
xander
looks
at
spike
then
they
both
walk
out
focus
on
buffy
as
they
walk
past
her
she
stares
at
the
floor
looking
pensive
gregor
chuckles
and
buffy
closes
her
eyes
briefly
then
looks
angrily
at
him
dissention
in
the
ranks
seldom
a
harbinger
of
glad
tidings
buffy
scowls
walks
over
to
him
and
backhands
him
across
the
face
shut
up
gregor
turns
his
head
and
spits
blood
buffy
turns
her
back
to
him
poor
frightened
girl
gregor
she
turns
back
you've
no
idea
what
you've
gotten
yourself
into
buffy
crosses
arms
over
her
chest
why
don't
you
tell
me
would
it
make
a
difference
pause
what
do
you
know
of
the
beast
strong
fast
hellgod
from
a
dimension
of
unspeakable
torment
a
demon
dimension
i
know
she
ruled
with
two
other
hellgods
right
along
with
the
beast
they
were
a
triumvirate
of
suffering
and
despair
ruling
with
equal
vengeance
but
the
beast's
power
grew
beyond
even
what
they
could
conceive
as
did
her
lust
for
pain
and
misery
they
looked
upon
her
what
she
had
become
and
trembled
buffy
nervously
a
god
afraid
such
was
her
power
they
feared
she
would
attempt
to
seize
their
dimension
for
herself
and
decided
to
strike
first
a
great
battle
erupted
in
the
end
they
stood
victorious
over
the
beast
barely
she
was
cast
out
banished
to
this
lower
plane
of
existence
forced
to
live
and
eventually
die
trapped
within
the
body
of
a
mortal
a
newborn
male
created
as
her
prison
that
is
the
beast's
only
weakness
kill
the
man
and
the
god
dies
unfortunately
the
identity
of
the
human
vessel
has
never
been
discovered
buffy
puzzled
i
don't
understand
now
i've
seen
glory
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
the
hairy
chest
department
you
have
seen
a
glimpse
of
the
true
beast
her
power
was
too
great
to
be
completely
contained
she's
found
a
way
to
escape
her
mortal
prison
for
brief
periods
before
her
energies
are
exhausted
and
she's
forced
back
into
her
living
cell
of
meat
and
bone
dawn
os
what
about
me
buffy
turns
to
see
dawn
standing
in
the
doorway
what
about
the
key
dawn
i
want
to
know
the
key
is
almost
as
old
as
the
beast
itself
where
it
came
from
how
it
was
created
the
deepest
of
mysteries
all
that
is
certain
is
that
its
power
is
absolute
countless
generations
of
my
people
have
sacrificed
their
lives
in
search
of
it
to
destroy
it
before
its
wrath
could
be
unleashed
but
the
monks
found
it
first
yes
and
hid
it
with
their
magicks
why
didn't
they
just
destroy
it
if
the
key
is
as
dangerous
as
because
they
were
fools
they
thought
they
could
harness
its
power
for
the
forces
of
light
they
failed
and
paid
with
their
blood
what
do
i
do
what
was
i
created
for
you
were
created
to
open
the
gates
that
separate
dimensions
the
beast
will
use
your
power
to
return
home
and
seize
control
of
the
hell
she
was
banished
from
buffy
laughs
the
general
looks
at
her
in
surprise
that's
it
that's
glory's
master
plan
to
go
home
you
misunderstand
once
the
key
is
activated
it
won't
just
open
the
gates
to
the
beast's
dimension
it's
going
to
open
all
the
gates
the
walls
separating
realities
will
crumble
gregor
shot
of
buffy
no
longer
smiling
shot
of
dawn
dimensions
will
bleed
into
each
other
order
will
be
overthrown
and
the
universe
will
tumble
into
chaos
all
dark
forever
buffy
looks
dismayed
gregor
staring
at
dawn
that
is
what
you
were
created
for
dawn
stares
at
him
then
looks
down
cut
to
buffy
emerging
from
the
back
room
into
another
room
dawn
we
see
dawn
sitting
on
a
table
nearby
she
has
her
back
to
buffy
dawn
not
turning
you
think
it's
true
what
he
said
buffy
walks
forward
with
a
sigh
sits
next
to
dawn
they
look
at
each
other
i
don't
know
destroyer
of
the
universe
dawn
pause
i
guess
cutting
school
doesn't
seem
so
bad
now
huh
it's
not
you
you
know
that
but
it's
in
me
isn't
it
it's
inside
me
they
look
at
each
other
for
a
moment
then
dawn
looks
away
what
are
we
gonna
do
buffy
frowns
slightly
then
puts
her
arms
around
dawn's
shoulders
and
pulls
dawn
close
resting
dawn's
head
on
her
cheek
i
won't
let
anything
happen
to
you
i
promise
they
sit
there
quietly
buffy
sighs
cut
to
the
back
room
willow
is
trying
to
feed
tara
while
gregor
still
tied
up
watches
tara
upset
wriggling
come
on
tara
you
have
to
eat
something
tara
turns
her
head
aside
and
whimpers
anya
walks
up
want
me
to
try
i
don't
know
i'm
gettin'
used
to
pickin'
fruit
out
of
my
hair
pan
over
to
the
general
nearby
we
see
ben
standing
over
a
small
sink
doing
something
with
gauze
gregor
whispers
you
ben
stops
what
he's
doing
but
doesn't
look
at
gregor
you
are
not
a
part
of
this
are
you
ben
still
not
looking
at
him
just
a
friend
of
the
family
would
you
die
for
them
ben
turns
to
look
at
him
because
that
is
what
your
future
holds
if
you
align
yourself
with
the
slayer
and
her
misguided
people
ben
walks
a
little
closer
angrily
it's
my
life
and
i'll
do
what
i
please
with
it
it's
not
just
your
life
unimaginable
legions
will
perish
including
everyone
here
gregor
whispers
you
can
stop
this
you
can
save
all
their
lives
by
ending
one
the
little
girl
the
key
destroy
it
and
the
will
of
the
beast
will
be
broken
she
will
fade
a
distant
memory

gregor
shot
of
ben
listening
looking
uncertain
and
all
of
this
madness
will
end
ben
just
glares
at
him
cut
to
dawn
standing
over
giles
watching
him
as
he
continues
to
sleep
breathing
raggedly
ben
walks
up
and
dawn
gasps
in
surprise
sorry
ben
puts
his
hand
on
giles's
wrist
and
takes
his
pulse
is
is
he
gonna
be
okay
dawn
shot

xander
watching

he
pulls
down
the
plunger
filling
the
syringe
with
liquid
dawn
continues
watching
giles
ben
flicks
the
needle
to
make
sure
it's
flowing
it's
nobody's
fault
he
turns
back
holding
the
needle
up
shot
of
dawn
with
her
back
to
ben
ben
moves
slowly
closer
to
her
it's
just
the
way
life
is
he
walks
past
dawn
and
puts
the
needle
to
giles's
arm
dawn
sees
it
and
gasps
shot
of
the
needle
injecting
into
giles
dawn
frowns
in
distaste
is
that
gonna
help
ben
doesn't

he
turns
away
ben
the
syringe
falls
to
the
ground
ben
has
his
back

shakily
to

and
suddenly
morphs
into
glory

the
movement
into
a
stretch
she
slowly
brings
her
arms
down
and
looks
around
buffy
and
dawn

in
horror

behind
her
glory

anya
watching

ben
finally
did
something
right
the
beast
hey

gregor
she
grabs
a
hubcap
that's
hanging
nearby
and
throws
it
like
a
frisbee
it
flies
into
the
general's
chest
everyone
stares
gregor
falls
forward
against
his
bonds

with
a
yell
xander
right
behind
him
glory
hits

he
crashes
backward
into

lowers
her
head
and
closes
her
eyes

try
to
get
up

looks
frightened
glory
runs
forward
and
grabs

glory
pulls
her
free
and
begins
running
out
buffy
buffy
painfully
tries
to
get
up
as
glory
dragging
dawn
by
the
hand
crashes
out
the
door
cut
to

into
the
barrier
