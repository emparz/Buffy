maybe
she
doubled
back
got
off

after
giles
left
well
if
she's
doing
that—ducking
giles—then
she's
evil
right
well
i've
avoided
giles
tons
of
times
just
meant
i
was
lazy
not
evil
i
hope
you're
right
because
defeating
lazy
willow—probably
less
hard
we
should
check
the
messages
see
if
she
tried
to
reach
us
here

ii
kept
telling

couldn't
face
like
she
didn't
think
we

cut
to
27
int
anya's
apartment
day
now
the
curtains
in
anya's
apartment
are
closed
blocking
the
sunlight
candles
are
lit
and
she
and
willow
are
sitting
on
the
floor
indianstyle
facing
each
other
with
a
map
of
sunnydale
between
them
this
isn't
going
to
get
all
sexy
is
it
i'd
be
shocked
ok
do
you
have
your
powder
oh
i
ate
that
i
have
it
ok
we
scatter
it
over
the
map
and
everywhere
there's
a
demon
a
little
light
appears
oh
pretty
will
it
hurt
the
carpet
no
willow
pauses
to
clear
her
thoughts
ok
scatter
willow
and
anya
dust
the
map
with
the
powder
from
their
individual
jars
several
individual
dots
glow
in
various
places
on
the
map
but
there
is
a
heavy
concentration
of
glowing
dots
in
the
center
of
the
map
oh
hey
look—that's
me
hello
what's
that
huge
clump
it's
the
high
school
it's
all
hellmouthy
is
underneath
things
have
been
stirring
there
lately
is
it
getting
brighter
smoke
the
clump
of
lights
at
the
high
school
gets
brighter
and
brighter
until
it
catches
the
map
on
fire
willow
and
anya
stand
up
immediately
and
willow
stamps
out
the
fire
with
her
foot
anya
is
upset
and
bends
down
to
investigate
the
damage
ah
ok
remember
our
talk
about
the
carpet
willow
holds
up
the
map
to
inspect
the
marks
left
behind
on
it
by
the
glowing
lights
thithis
could
be
it
it's
strong
it's
near
the
body
and
it's
all
by
itself
hiding
in
the
woods
oror
maybe
cave
there
are
a
couple
of
good
caves
around
there
i
don't
know
sounds
pretty
thin
to
me
anya
starts
cleaning
up
the
mark
on
the
rug
well
that's
why
you
teleport
over
there
real
quick
like
a
bunn—real
quick
and
uh
see
if
i'm
right
no
sorry
you
damaged
my
carpet
anya
you're
a
vengeance
demon
just
teleport
well
as
it
turns
out
teleporting
isn't
a
right
it's
a
privilege
i
withdrew
a
vengeance
spell
last
week
and
this
is
my
punishment
i
can
only
teleport
for
official
business
i
have
to
file
a
flight
plan
and
everything
oh
i'm
sorry
that
must
be
hard
yeah
it
bites
a
pretty
big
one
and
the
vengeance
itself
iit's
not
as
fulfilling
as
i
remember
really
'cause
i
got
the
impression
that
you
enjoyed—you
know
inflicting
well
causing
pain
sounds
really
cool
i
know
but
turns
out
it's
really
upsetting
didn't
use
to
be
but
now
it
is
anya
walks
around
still
fussing
over
the
carpet
stain
is
it
like
you're
scared
of
losing
that
feeling
again
and
that
having
it
be
ok
to
hurt
people
and
then
you're
not
in
charge
of
the
power
anymore
because
it's
in
charge
of
you
wow
that
was
really
overdramatically
stated
but
yeah
that's
it
i
get
it
believe
me
anya
sincerely
i'm
sorry
willow
i
wish
it
were
better
for
you
you
too
it
did
get
a
little
sexy
didn't
it
willow
nods
then
catches
herself
walks
away
quickly
i
have
to
find
this
monster
anya
holding
candles
now
willow
um
isn't
there
another
spell
i
mean
you're
trying
to
find
buffy
and
xander
couldn't
we
use
a
spell
to
do
that
i
did
ii
tried
and
something
went
kaflooey
and
it
didn't
work
what
did
it
say
it
said
they
don't
exist
willow
walks
out
of
the
apartment
and
closes
the
door
behind

blows
out
the
candles
cut

and
xander
are
sitting
around
the
dining
room

doing
research
buffy
has
several
books
open
in
front
of
her
while
dawn
is
surfing
the
internet
on
her
laptop
xander
has
a
book
in
his
lap
ok
so
i
looked
up
demons
that
skin
their
victims
and
demons
that
flay
their
victims
'cause
you
know
same
thing
there's
a
ton
of
prospects
anything
else
gone
uh
eyeballs
toenails
or
viscera
that's
guts
she
knows
about
viscera
makes
you
proud
just
skin
ok
i'll
work
on
that
buffy
sighs
stands
up
and
walks
to
a
corner
of
the
room
xander
follows
what's
up
i
need
to
do
something
i
just—i
have
this
feeling
in
my
gut—
in
your
viscera
—that
we
know
exactly
who
did
this
and
all
of
this
work
that
we're
doing
is
just
a
way
for
us
to
convince
ourselves
that
willow's
ok
oh
guys
dawn
gesturing
them
to
come
over
to
her
i
got
a
good
one
a
demon
called
gnarl
he's
a
parasite
with
these
nasty
long
fingernails
he
secretes
something
through
them
and
uses
that
to
paralyze
his
victims
he
then
cuts
strips
of
their
skin
while
they're
still
alive
it
takes
hours
we
didn't
find
any
strips
of
skin
which
by
the
way
xander
shudders
gghhhh
you
wouldn't
he
eats
them
that's
why
he's
a
parasite
it's
like
his
natural
food
dawn
you're
new
at
this
and
i
get
why
you're
proud
but
i'm
not
exactly
sure
why
this
demon
is
any
more
likely
than
any
of
the
others
you
never
said
pool
of
blood
there
was
no
pool
just
splatters
dawn
smiling
then
this
is
your
guy
he
laps
up
the
blood
you
could
say
it's
like
his
natural
beverage
xander
points
at
dawn
you're
terrifying
now
if
we
just
knew
how
to
find
this
thing
well
we
could
ask
some
questions
over
at
willy's
place
or
we
could
be
smart
sorry
xander
what
wwhoever
did
this
had
to
get
blood
on
them
which
means
they
left
a
trail
right
minute
traces
of
blood
and
we
have
a
way
to
track
it
we
have
a—
oh

get
it

how
what's
going

of
stuff
like
this
you
know
procedures
we
can
use
that
don't
involve
magic
spells
just
good
solid
detective
work

we
can
develop
a
database
of
tooth
impressions
and
demon
skin
samples

wear
high
heels
more
often

blood
off

there's
no
one
to
help
you
gnarl
removes
a
strip
of
skin
about
the
size
of
a
french
fry
from
her
stomach
he
dangles
it
over
his
mouth
and
sucks
it
in
like
spaghetti
savoring
every
morsel
of
her
raw
flesh
he
groans
with
pleasure
and
bends
over
to
lick

just
paralyzed
oh
paralyzed
how
paralyzed
how
in
the
not
moving
way
well
there's
lots
of
different
ways
did
you
try
this
anya
takes
dawn's
legs
and
lifts
them
up
ninety
degrees
bending
her
at
the
waist
her
legs
don't
fall
back
down
hey
dawn
without
moving
her
lips
hey
oh
you're
poseable
she's
poseable
it's
a
common
variety
watch
this
anya
rearranges
dawn
so
that
she's
sitting
on
the
couch
now
upright
huh
neat
as
you
please
hardly
a
need
to
undo
her
buffy
mouthful
of
nuts
where'd
you
get
the
nuts
brazil
no
need
to
thank
me
by
the
way
for
sitting
with
her
i'm
feeling
very
benevolent
today
helping
willow
helping
you
you
might
even
call
it
even
for
that
whole
worm
thing
last
week
yeah
i
don't
think
we
could
call—
wait
you
saw
willow
umhmm
oh
she's
looking
for
you
by
the
way
decided
you
might
be
out
in

cave

pretty
tenuous

without
moving

lips
cave
anya
listen
this
is
really
important

willow
go
to
that
cave
mmhmm
last
time

where
she
was
headed

turning
to
dawn
shall
i
make
her
salute
that'd
be
very
cute
xander

could
be
there
right

could
be
trapped
with
the
gnarl
anya
playing
with
dawn's
hand
uh
it's
not
the
gnarl
just
gnarl
oh

her
and
decides
not
to
interrupt
her
willow
opens
her
eyes
buffy
oh
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
that's
all
i
had
left
in
me
anyway
i
didn't
realize
meditating
was
such
hard
work
i'm
healing
growing
new
skin
buffy
walks
toward
willow
wow
that's
magic
right
i
mean
when
most
people
when
they
meditate
don't
get
extra
skin
right
'cause
clem
should
like
cut
back
buffy
sits
on
edge
of
bed
it's
magic
i'm
drawing
power
from
the
earth
to
heal
myself
we're
on
the
second
floor
willow
laughs
you
know
giles
says
everything's
part
of
the
earth
this
bed
the
air
us
explains
why
my
fingernails
get
dirty
even
when
i
don't
do
anything
plus
you
stuck
your
thumbs
in
a
demon
true
willow
leans
back
exhausted
you're
wiped
out
ii
should
go
no
please
stay
i
missed
you
so
much
when
i
couldn't
find
you
we
missed
you
too
i
missed
you
dawn's
uh
working
on
what
caused
the
mutual
noseeums
but
so
far
we
haven't—
i
did
it
you
did
a
spell
i
didn't
mean
to
ii
just
remember
thinking
i
wasn't
ready
to
see
you
guys
yet
i
was
afraid
we
wouldn't
you
know
connect
so
you
made
it
happen
just
by
thinking
it
guess
i
have
a
ways
to
go
before
i
master
my
powers
huh
it's
ok
as
long
as
you're
all
right
it's
nice
to
be
forgiven
too
bad
i
need
so
much
of
it
i
have
a
confession
to
make
i
thought
it
might
be
you
with
the
flaying
i
know
i
wanna
be
the
kind
of
person
that
wouldn't
think
that
xander
never
thought
it
he
did
a
little
heck
i
did
a
little
xander
has
the
luxury
of
not
saying
it
but
you're
the
slayer
you
have
to
say
stuff
like
that
it's
ok
it's
ok
too
if
you
still
don't
think
i
can
recover
from
this
magic
stuff
'cause
honestly
i'm
not
that
sure
about
it
either
willow
leans
forward
again
sighing
to
begin
meditating
again
i
thought
you
were
too
tired
it
hurts
too
much
not
to
try
i'm
sorry
it
just
takes
so
much
strength
i
don't
have
that
much
i
got
so
much
strength
i'm
giving
it
away
are
you
sure
will
it
help
much
buffy
sits
crosslegged
in
front
of
willow
and
holds
her
hands
they
meditate
together
good
closing
