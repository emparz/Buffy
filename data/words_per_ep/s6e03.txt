come
roaring
up

seem
to
be
making
with

skedaddle

looks
around
nervously
iit
was
buffy
right
we
we
saw
her
and

was
really
buffy
they
resume
walking
i
think
we
screwed
it
up
she's
broken
no
she's
not
broken
she's
just
disoriented
from
being
tormented
in
some
hell
dimension
probably
tortured
and
it's
like
we
don't
even
know
how
much
time
has
passed
there
for
her
uh
possibly
years
that's
not
something
you
just
get
over
oh
my
god
what
if
she
never
gets
over
it
and
you
think
of
this
now
what
are
you
thinking
willow
thatthat

she's
not
right
or
or
maybe
like
dangerous
cut

defensively
well

all
the
time
cut
to
exterior
summers
house
night
anya
and
xander
come

bufferin
again

cause
six
or
seven
days
that's
all
you
really
need
to
get
over
eternal
hell
experiences
xander
hears
something
looks
off
to
the
left
who's
that
spike
we
see
spike
leaning
against
a
tree
his
back
to
them
he
lifts
a
hand
and
wipes
his
eyes
xander
and
anya
come
closer
what
are
you
doing
out
here
i
hope
you're
not
going
to
start
your
little
obsession
now
that
she's
around
again
spike
grabs
xander
and
spins
him
around
slams
him
up
against
the
tree
and
holds
him
there
hey
you
didn't
tell
me
you
brought
her
back
and
you
didn't
tell
me
well
now
you
know
i
worked
beside
you
all
summer
we
didn't
tell
you
it
was
just
we
didn't
okay
listen
i've
figured
it
out
spike
lets
go
of
xander
but
doesn't
move
away
continues
glaring
at
him
spike
angrily
maybe
you
haven't
but
i
have
spike
still
has
tears
in
his
eyes
he
points
toward
the
house
willow
knew
there
was
a
chance
that
she'd
come
back
wrong
so
wrong
that
you'd
have
that
she
would
have
to
get
rid
of
what
came
back
and
i
wouldn't
let
her
if
any
part
of
that
was
buffy
i
wouldn't
let
her
and
that's
why
she
shut
me
out
what
are
you
talking
about
willow
wouldn't
do
that
spike
sarcastic
oh
is
that
right
look
you're
just
covering
don't
tell
me
you're
not
happy
xander
spike
scoffs
look
me
in
the
eyes
and
tell
me
when
you
saw
buffy
alive
that
wasn't
the
happiest
moment
of
your
entire
existence
spike
gives
xander
a
you
just
don't
get
it
scowl
turns
and
walks
off
spike
as
he
walks
that's
the
thing
about
magic
there's
always
consequences
we
see
the
motorcycle
that
spike
acquired
in
bargaining
sitting
on
the
street
in
front
of
the
house
spike
gets
on
it

starts
up
the
bike

beat
willow
continues
staring
at
the
ceiling
tara
yeah
if
things
did
go
right
wouldn't
you
think

think

so
happy

say

suddenly
the

xander
slurred
in
the
house
all

laugh
and
moves
toward
xander
xander
into
phone
wake
up
buffy

a
big
deal
we
see
anya
still
moving
toward
him
she
has
a
knife
and
is
using
it
to
cut
her
face
she
continues
laughing
xander
looks
up
and
sees
her
gah
he
jumps
up
grabs
the
knife
anya
crumples
to
the
floor
unconscious
her
cheeks
are
unmarked
anya
he
kneels
beside
her
anya
shot
of
anya's
feet
with
xander's
foot
beside
them
a
weird
bulge
appears
in
the
carpet
and
moves
away
from

into
the
kitchen
willow
on

xander
xander
cut

of
xander's
chair
rubbing
his
back
anya
to
willow
and
tara
he's
all
traumatized
well
whatever
it
is
it's
not
the
the
traditional
haunting
because
iit's
not
limited
to
one
specific
place
and
there's
not
you
know
a
dead
person

more
i
bet
it's
a
hitchhiker
a
hitchhiker
um
standard
way
to
travel
through
dimensions
uh
some
demonthing
sees
someone
moving
between
worlds
and
grabs
on
for
the
ride
you
mean
like
some
hellbeastie
rode
in
with
buffy
like
we're
responsible
for
this
assume
crash
positions
i
think
we
shouldn't've
brought
buffy
back
i
knew
it
was
going
to
end
badly
i
should've
said
something
okay
fine
but
what
are
we
gonna
do
i
mean
i'm
feeling
the
need
for
some
vigorous
doing
you
know
it's
okay
we
we
just
kill
the
beastie
and
then
all
is
good
we're
rolling
in
puppies
right
can
we
do
that
kill
it
buffy
os
we
killing
something
they
all
look
up
in
surprise
buffy
stands
there
in
jeans
and
a
shirt
holding
a
coffee
mug
buffy
you're
not
supposed
to
be
up
how
how

we
killing
a
demon
you
brought
back
from
hell
with
you
anya
willow
gives

angry
look
oh

making
it
sound
a
little
hauntingtype
stuff
booscary
everything's
normal
you
shouldn't
worry
about
it
um
i
remember
something
last
night
uh
she
trails
off
loses
focus
they
all
stare
for
a
moment
waiting
for
her
to
continue
buff
buffy
snaps
out
of
it
um
the
photographs
oof
us
they
changed
how
did
they
change
they
were
dead
iii
mean
we
were
dead
like
um
dead
bodies
but
but
then
they
were
okay
so
i
just
you
know
figured
it
was
me
that
i
was
going
crazy
well
maybe
you
are
going
crazy
from
hell
willow
gives
anya
another
angry
look
anya
fake
scoff
no
you're
fine
you
are
and
buffy
we're
we're
so
glad
yeah
this
thing
this
haunting
thing
we'll
fix
it
and
then
we'll
still
have
you
back
which
is
it's
so
important
yes
it's
wonderful
buffy
takes
all
this
in
stonefaced
we
should
get
to
work
cut
to
interior
magic
shop
we
see
willow
tara
xander
and
anya
sitting
around
the
table
looking
at
books
willow
is
writing
dawn
stands
behind
willow
looking
over
her
shoulder
what's
the
list
possible
hitchhikers
demons
that
might
have
come
out
of
hell
at
the
same
time
buffy
did
dawn
reads
skaggmore
demons
trellbane
demons
skitterers
large
and
small
boneeaters
if
we
get
to
pick
i
say
we
go
with
the
small
boneeaters
well
that
just
means
they
prefer
to
eat
things
with
small
bones
like
you
that's
just
what
we
have
so
far
five
species
of
demons
that
have
been
known
to
move
transdimensionally
two
of
them
may
be
invisible
in
this
dimension
and
uh
two
others
can
perform
spells
to
alter
perception
well
that's
four
what's
the
other
one
like
uh
like
the
others
only
dripping
with
viscous
fluid
eww
so
should
we
concentrate
on
how
to
kill
those
or
should
we
try
to
find
more
i'm
not
sure
maybe
maybe
some
of
us
can
uh
keep
going
finding
more
and
the
others
i
miss
giles
we
see
buffy
sitting
across
the
table
from
willow
oh

coming
back
i
talked
to
him
i
know
i'm
a
kind
of
poor
substitute
but
until
then
we'll
get
it
done
buffy
looks
around
at
them
they
all
look
expectantly
at
her
i
think
i
should
patrol
she
puts
her
book
down
and
stands
willow
looks
hurt
well
i
know
we'll
find
something
soon
yeah

and
tara
pull
dawn
to
a
sitting
position
that

with
fire
we
see
the
bulge
thing
under
the
floor
moving
away

i
hope

really
glamorous
cutting
up
your
face
dawn
comes
to
what
what
is

experience
some
drymouth
anya

it
did
the
demon
thing
have
me
it's
okay
it's
okay
yeah

gone
yes
but
where
did
it
go
i
mean
evil
things
have
plans
they
have
things
to
do
cut
to
interior
of
spike's
crypt
we're
in
the
lower
level
spike
paces
back
and
forth
restlessly
we
see
that
there's
more
furniture
now
a
chair
a
bookcase
with
a
lamp
on
it
etc
spike
paces
a
bit
then
suddenly
turns
around
and
punches
the
wall
he
laughs
a
little
looks
at
his
bloodied
hand
laughs
some
more
a
little
hysterically
a
noise
from
upstairs
spike
looks
alarmed
picks
up
a
dagger
and
removes
it
from
its
sheath
he
goes
to
the
ladder
and
climbs
up
cut
to
above
spike
emerges
moves
slowly
and
quietly
into
the
crypt
holding
the
dagger
by
his
side
we
see
a
person
standing
by
a
table
looking
at
some
magazines
that
are
spread
out
buffy
buffy
turns
around
and
looks
at
him
her
expression
is
still
basically
blank
spike
quietly
you
should
be
careful
never
know
what
kind
of
villain's
got
a
knife
at
your
back
your
hand
is
hurt
hmm
spike
nods
toward
her
hands
same
with
you
buffy
looks
down
at
her
hands
right
buffy
just
stands
there
spike
looks
at
her
seems
uncomfortable
not
sure
what
to
do
he
walks
over
to
the
wall
and
puts
the
knife
down
willow's
getting
pretty
strong
isn't
she
bringing
you
back
it's
hard
to
get
a
good
night's
death
around
here
he
tries
a
little
laugh
but
gets
no
response
you
can
sit
down
got
furniture
buffy
sits
on
a
chair
you
should
see
the
downstairs
too
it's
quite
posh
she
looks
at
him
doesn't
say
anything
spike
walks
over
sighs
sits
on
the
edge
of
a
table
across
from
her
buffy
just
stares
at
him
uh
i
do
remember
what
i
said
the
promise
to
protect
her
spike
pause
if
i
had
done
that
even
if
i
didn't
make
it
you
wouldn't
have
had
to
jump
beat
buffy
still
doesn't
react
just
sits
there
looking
at
him
but
i
want
you
to
know
i
did
save
you
not
when
it
counted
of
course
but
after
that
every
night
after
that
i'd
see
it
all
again
do
something
different
faster
or
more
clever
you
know
dozens
of
times
lots
of
different
ways

spike
softly
every
night
i
save
you
cut
to
interior
magic
shop
xander
stands
by
the
window
peering
through
the
blinds
tara
comes
over
it's
getting
light
out
buffy's
probably
on
her
way
home
from
patrolling
i
like
sunrise
better
when
i'm
getting
up
early
than
when
i'm
staying
up
late
you
know
it's
like
i'm
seeing
it
from
the
wrong
side
xander
nervous
hey
tara
this
is
probably
crazy
but
spike
got
me
to
thinking
this
spell
we
did
it's
having
consequences
isn't
it
i
mean
it
sure
seems
like
it
and
i
was
just
wondering
did
you
know
that
this
might
happen
no
do
you
think
could
someone
have
known
willow
is
a
talented
witch
and
she
would
never
do
anything
to
hurt
anyone
i
know
i
know
huh
xander
raises
his
hands
backing
off
quickly
hands
in
the
air
xander
sighs
i
just
meant
thaumogenesis
xander
and
tara
look
over
at
willow
who
is
at
the
counter
still
looking
through
the
books
we
see
anya
and
dawn
with
their
heads
on
the
table
jerking
awake
at
willow's
shout
she's
possessed
thaumogenesis
dawn
to
anya
you're
right
xander
and
tara
go
over
to
willow
i'm
not
possessed
ii
think
i
figured
it
out
this
demon
iit's
not
a
demon
we
let
out
it's
it's
a
demon
that
we
made
we
made
a
demon
bad
us
thaumogenesis
is
when
doing
a
spell
actually
creates
a
being
in
this
case
it
was
like
a
a
sideeffect
i
guess
like
a
price
what
think
of
it
like
the
world
doesn't
like
you
getting
something
for
free
and
we
asked
for
this
huge
gift
buffy
aand
so
the
world
said
'fine
but
if
you
have
that
you
have
to
take
this
too'
and
it
made
the
demon
well
technically
that's
not
a
price
that's
a
gift
with
purchase
um
but
if
we
made
the
demon
how
come
we
can't
see
it
i
mean
all
we
see
is
us
doing
stuff
well
i
i
think
it's
out
of
phase
with
this
dimension
like
its
consciousness
is
here
but
but
its
body
is
caught
in
the
ether
between
existing
and
not
existing
it
doesn't
have
a
body
so
it's
borrowing
ours
iit
borrowed
dawn
and
anya
or
or
it's
manifesting
copies
of
them
like
like
it
did
when
buffy
came
at
us
it's
using
them
to
do
stuff
to
scare
us
attack
us
so
we
need
to
uncreate
it
right
we
need
to
send
it
the
rest
of
the
way
out
of
our
world
uhhuh
except
that
it's
linked
to
the
spell
so
if
we
sent
it
away
it
would
be
like
the
spell
doesn't
exist
like
it
never
happened
like
it
never
brought
buffy
back
willow
softly
yes
you
can't
do
that
dawn
stands
you
can't
think
for
a
second
that
you're
going
to
do
that
dawn
dawn
walks
over
to
willow
if
you
think
you
can
give
her
back
to
me
and
then
take
her
away
again
no
that's
worse
than
if
you'd
never
brought
her
back
you
can't
mess
with
people's
lives
this
way
dawn
we're
not
going
to
do
it
that
way
dawn
to
the
others
how
can
you
let
her
do
this
how
can
you
even
talk
about
letting
her
go
honey
you're
not
listening
she
said
we
will
find
another
way
we
will
then
do
it
willow
has
turned
back
to
her
book
wait
wait
dawn
everybody
hold
on
willow
smiles
what
why
are
you
smiling
that's
inappropriate
because
it's
temporary
what
is
the
demon
iit's
gonna
dissipate
the
only
way
for
it
to
survive
on
this
plane
is
if
it
were
to
kill
the
subject
of
the
original
spell
it
would
live
if
it
killed
buffy
that's
not
gonna
xander
lifts
his
head
and
we
see
that
his
eyes
are
white
thanks
for
the
tip
he
collapses
to
the
floor
again
we
see
the
little
bulge
move
across
the
floor
toward
a
wall
cut
to
interior
of
the
summers
house
night
buffy
opens
the
door
and
comes
in
puts
her
keys
on
the
table
starts
up
the
stairs
behind
her
we
see
a
white
mist
it
slowly
coalesces
into
a
vaguely
human
shape
reaching
out
arms
toward
buffy
as
it
moves
up
the
stairs
after
her
blackout
act
iv

open
on
buffy's
darkened
bedroom
buffy
comes
in
she
pauses
to
look
at
the
pictures
on
the
wall
again
demon
whispery
voice
you
don't
belong
here
buffy
turns
to
see
the
demonmist
floating
in
buffy
punches
at
it
but
her
fist
just
goes
through
it
it
shoots
out
a
tendril
and
hits
her
and
she
flies
back
against
some
furniture
she
recovers
her
balance
turns
back
around
and
looks
around
in
confusion
the
mist
reappears
and
buffy
punches
at
it
again
the
mist
swirls
around
her
and
reforms
behind
her
she
turns
and
punches
again
still
nothing
the
demon
hits
her
again
and
she
stumbles
out
the
door
into
the
hallway
into
the
opposite
wall
she
turns
and
looks
back
at
the
door
into
her
room
the
mist
is
gone
buffy
walks
cautiously
back
into
the
room
demon
os
did
they
tell
you
you
belonged
here
the
mist
reappears
in
front
of
buffy
puts
out
a
hand
she
tries
to
grab
the
wrist
seems
to
almost
have
it
but
then
her
hand
just
goes
through
it
did
they
say
this
was
your
home
again
it
disappears
again
reappears
buffy
hits
at
it
with
no
effect
it
swirls
around
behind
her
while
she's
still
looking
for
it
in
front
of
her
were
you
offered
pretty
lies
little
girl
it
swirls
around
her
and
wraps
around
her
waist
it
seems
to
be
crushing
her
or
did
they
even
give
you
a
choice
cut
to
xander's
car
driving
down
the
dark
street
xander
is
driving
anya
in
the
passenger
seat
and

the
back
seat

drive
faster
and
i

a
car
very
slowly

buffy
with
that
demon

demon

possessed
the
demon

dawnie
willow
and
tara
are
doing
a
spell
you
sure
it
won't
send
buffy
back
no
of
course
not
it's
just
that
she
can't
fight
this
thing
if
it's
all
misty
so
they
make
it
more
solid
so
buffy
can
kick
its
fully
embodied
ass
you
sure
it'll
work
cut
to
the
magic
shop
willow
and
tara
sit
on
the
floor
facing
each
other
holding
hands
candles
are
lit
around
them
child
of
words
hear
thy
makers
child
of
words
we
entreat
with
our
actions
did
we
make
thee
to
our
voices
wilt
thou
bend
cut
back
to
buffy's
room
buffy
is
still
struggling
in
the
grip
of
the
demon
squeezing
her
around
the
stomach
she
curls
her
hands
into
fists
and
manages
to
break
free
swings
at
the
demon
it
hits
her
and
she
falls
on
the
bed
rolls
off
the
side
onto
the
floor
the
demon
stands
still
it
seems
to
be
becoming
more
solid
buffy
lies
on
the
floor
stares
up
at
it
cut
back
to
the
magic
shop
with
our
potions
thou
took
motive
with
our
motions
came
to
pass
we
rescind
no
past
devotions
give
thee
substance
give
thee
mass
cut
back
to
buffy's
room
she
reaches
under
the
bed
and
produces
a
battleaxe
starts
to
get
up
you're
the
one
who's
barely
here
set
on
this
earth
like
a
bubble
buffy
swings
the
axe
at
the
demon
without
any
effect
and
again
the
face
is
a
little
clearer
now
the
demon
stops
swirling
and
confronts
buffy
for
the
first
time
we
can
actually
see
its
mouth
move
when
it
talks
you
won't
even
disturb
the
air
when
you
go
xander
anya
and
dawn
rush
in
see
the
demon
and
react
with
fear
buffy
turns
and
sees
them
go
take
dawn
out
of
here
cut
back
to
the
magic
shop
willow
has
her
eyes
closed
and
her
face
turned
upward
tara
continues
chanting
not
realizing
that
willow
has
stopped
child
of
words
hear
thy
makers
child
of
words
we
entreat
tara
trails
off
as
she
notices
willow
a
haze
of
golden
light
gathers
around
willow
she
pulls
her
hands
out
of
tara's
her
eyes
snap
open
they
are
completely
black
solid
cut
back
to
buffy's
room
the
demon
suddenly
becomes
fully
solid
it
looks
like
the
rotting
corpse
of
a
woman
taller
than
buffy
buffy
tries
to
hit
it
with
the
axe
but
the
demon
grabs
the
axe
handle
they
struggle
over
it
for
a
moment
then
the
demon
lets
go
and
hits
buffy
making
her
drop
the
axe
she
turns
back
and
the
demon
hits
her
again
buffy
goes
down
xander
dawn
and
anya
are
still
in
the
doorway
watching
fearfully
clutching
each
other
buffy
picks
up
the
axe
jumps
up
from
the
floor
and
swings
shot
of
the
demon's
head
bouncing
across
the
floor
xander
dawn
and
anya
all
give
little
yelps
of
dismay
dawn
turns
her
face
away
grabbing
xander's
arms
buffy
looks
down
at
the
demon's
body
which
we
don't
see
dawn
to
xander
that's
probably
the
sort
of
thing
i'm
not
supposed
to
see
right
anya
pats
dawn
on
the
shoulder
cut
to
overhead
shot
of
sunnydale
day
cut
to
exterior
shot
of
the
summers
house
it's
a
bright
sunny
day
birds
chirping
etc
dawn
comes
out
the
front
door
dressed
for
school
she
walks
down
the
steps
starts
down
the
walk
buffy
opens
the
door
dawn
dawn
turns
back
dawn
alarmed
what's
wrong
buffy
comes
down
the
stairs
holding
a
brown
paper
bag
lunch
dawn
smiling
happily
you
made
me
lunch
dawn
takes
the
lunchbag
wow

what
they
say
those
of
us
who

to
repeat
it
in
summer
school
they
both
give
small
smiles
dawn
hugs
buffy
dawn
whispers
thank
you
dawn
pulls
out
of
the
hug
are
you
okay
i'm
going
to
start
charging
money
for
every
person
that
asks
me
that
everyone's
been
doing
that
huh
a
little
bit
it's
because
they
care
about
you
a
lot
when
you
were
gone
it
was
bad
when
you
were
gone
but
it'll
be
better
now
now
that
they
can
see
you
being
happy
dawn
pause
that's
all
they
want
dawn
turns
and
walks
off
buffy
watches
thoughtful
cut
to
interior
magic
shop
tara
is
sitting
on
a
chair
and
willow
standing
both
putting
books
on
shelves
the
door

willow
turns
and
smiles
buffy

it
buffy
nervous
look

um

this
thing
so
i'm
just
gonna
say

they
all
look
expectantly
at
her
you
brought
me
back
i
was
in
a
i
was
in
hell
i
um
i
can't
think
too
much
about
what
it
was
like
but
it
felt
like
the
world
abandoned
me
there
and
then
suddenly
you
guys
did
what
you
did
it
was
willow
she
knew
what
to
do
tara
willow
looks
embarrassed
okay
so
you

that
and
the
world
came
rushing
back
thank
you
you
guys
gave
me
the
world
i
can't
tell
you
what
it
means
to
me
willow
has
tears
in
her
eyes
and
i
should
have
said
it
before
willow
tearful
you're
welcome
willow
hugs
buffy
welcome
home
buffy
xander
puts
his
arms
around
the
two
of
them
they
all
hug
buffy's
expression
is
still
less
than
thrilled
cut
to
the
back
alley
behind
the
magic
shop
buffy
comes
out
closes
the
door
behind
her
slowly
walks
a
few
steps
thinking
buffy
buffy
looks
up
sees
spike
standing
in
the
alley
buffy
frowns
spike
it's
daylight
and
you're
not
on
fire
spike
looks
at
the
sky
sun's
low
enough
shady
enough
here
buffy
folds
her
arms
around
her
middle
i
was
gonna
go
inside
but
i
overheard
you
and
the
superfriends
exchanging
a
special
moment
and
i
came
over
a
bit
queasy
buffy
wipes
hair
out
of
her
face
doesn't
seem
to
be
listening
say
aren't
you
leaving
a
hole
in
the
middle
of
some
soggy
group
hug
just
wanted
a
little
time
alone
she
walks
over
sits
on
a
packing
crate
a
few
feet
away
from
spike
oh
uh
right
then
he
gets
up
starts
to
walk
away
reaches
the
line
of
shadow
realizes
he
can't
leave
the
alley
without
going
into
the
sunlight
he
stops
squints
at
the
sky
that's
okay
i
can
be
alone
with
you
here
thanks
ever
so
he
gives
a
rueful
smile
looks
back
at
her
right
beat
buff
slayer
are
you
okay
she
isn't
but
she
composes
herself
and
nods
at
him
i'm
here
i'm
good
spike
walks
back
to
her
buffy
if
you're
in
if
you're
in
pain
or
if
you
need
anything
or
if
i
can
do
anything
for
you
buffy
looks
down
at
her
lap
you
can't
well
i
haven't
been
to
a
hell
dimension
just
of
late
but
i
do
know
a
thing
or
two
about
torment
he
sits
beside
her
buffy
still
looking
down
i
was
happy
spike
looks
at
her
in
confusion
wherever
i
was
i
was
happy
at
peace
spike
stares
shocked
i
knew
that
everyone
i
cared
about
was
all
right
i
knew
it
time
didn't
mean
anything
nothing
had
form
but
i
was
still
me
you
know
buffy
glances
at
him
then
away
and
i
was
warm
and
i
was
loved
and
i
was
finished
complete
i
don't
understand
about
theology
or
dimensions
or
any
of
it
really
but
i
think
i
was
in
heaven
spike
continues
to
stare
at
her
in
dismay
and
now
i'm
not
buffy
almost
tearful
i
was
torn
out
of
there
pulled
out
by
my
friends
buffy
spike
continues
staring
listening
everything
here
is
hard
and
bright
and
violent
everything
i
feel
everything
i
touch
this
is
hell
just
getting
through
the
next
moment
and
the
one
after
that

buffy
softly
knowing
what
i've
lost
she
looks
up
realizes
spike
is
still
there
she
looks
uncomfortable
gets
up
she
walks
just
to
the
line
where
the
shadows
become
sunlight
and
pauses
but
doesn't
turn
back
to
face
spike
they
can
never
know
never
she
still
doesn't
look
back
at
him
just
continues
walking
into
the
sunlight
blackout
joss
whedon
and
marti
noxon
the
end
