hi
hey
so
i
was
wondering
maybe
if
you
were
free
this
weekend
maybe
we
could
do
some
entertaining
thing
would
that
be
along
the
lines
of
you
telling
me
about
all
the
men
you
destroyed
back
in
your
demon
days
cause
pencil
me
in
well
we
could
do
something
else
you
like
we
could
watch
sports
of
some
kind
uh
i
don't
know
men
like
sports
i'm
sure
of
it
yes
men
like
sports
men
watch
the
action
move
they
eat
of
the
beef
and
enjoy
to
look
at
the
bosoms
a
thousand
years
of
avenging
our
wrongs
and
that's
all
you've
learned
i'm
trying
okay
you
don't
need
to
take
my
head
off
i'm
sorry
look
i
don't
even
know
if
i'm
going
to
make
it
to
the
next
weekend
i'll
tell
you
what
i
survive
the
ascension
and
maybe
you
and
i
can
do
some
sports
related
what
anya
has

there's
nothing
in
here
that

everybody
does
seem
to
be

lately
faith
has
something
of
a
head
start
doesn't
read
i
think
it's
homework
giles
stops
sparring
the
mayor
wanted
the
good
professor
out
of
the
way
which
leads
to
the
question
how
come
i'm
gonna
destroy
the
entire
city
but
i
take
the
time
to
kill
harmless
lester
first
tying
up
loose
ends
lester
had
something
or
knew
something
then
i
wanna
know
too
the
mayor's
trying
to
hide
i
say
we
go
seek
ah
by
attempting
to
keep
a
valuable
clue
from
us
the
mayor
may
have
inadvertently
led
us
right
to
it
wesley
with
a
sword
flourish
what
page
are
you
on
wes
cause
we
already
got
there
yes
well
you
will
go
tonight
look
over
his
apartment
anything
of
note
report
back
here
i
just
love
it
when
you
take
charge
you
man
you
uh
we
was
that
a
yes
i
have
trouble
keeping
track
i'll
go
be
careful
if
faith
should
show
up
i
don't
think
she'll
show
been
there
killed
that
she's
not
much
for
followup
nonetheless
keep
watch
faith
has
you
at
a
disadvantage
buffy
cause
i'm
not
crazy
or
cause
i
don't
kill
people
both
actually
i
hear
you
i
can't
kill
her
fun
as
it
may
sound
i
can
make
her
cry
uncle
though
and
i
mean
to
don't
let
your
feelings
about
faith
interfere
with
your
work
stopping
faith
is
my
work
take
a
beat
to
love
the
synergy
faith
is
a
footnote
our
priority
is
stopping

about
eight
hundred
years

in

there
was
a
sorcerer
there
who
achieved
ascension
became
the
embodiment
of
the
demon
lohash
i
was
there
cursing
a
shepherd

been
the
cause
of
most
of
them

sorry
but
lohash
was
a
fourwinged
soul
killer
am
i
right
wesley

that
they're
not

we've
faced
you've
never
seen
a
demon
buffy
raises
her
hand
uh
excuse
me
kind
of
professionally
four
years
running
all
the
demons
that
walk
the
earth
are
tainted
are
human
hybrids
like
vampires
the
ascension
means
that
a
human
becomes
pure
demon

different
different
how
well
for
one
thing
they're
bigger

here
i
know
things

well
different
here
in
sunnydale
we've
both
seen
all

important
is
that
we
keep
it
under

that's
what
you've
done
i

to
say

inner
sanctum
faith
tells
me
this
is
where
you
folks
like
to
hang
out
concoct
your
little
schemes
i
tell
you
it's
just
nice
to
see
that
some
young
people
are
still
interested
in
reading
in
this
modern
era
so
what
are
kids
reading
nowadays
the
mayor
walks
to
the
table
and
picks
up
a
book
giles
stands
his
ground
and
doesn't
flinch
at
the
proximity
the
beast
will
walk
upon
the
earth
and
darkness
will
follow
the
several
races
of
man
will
be
as
one
in
their
terror
and
destruction
aw
that's
kind
of
sweet
different
races
coming
together
you
never
get
even
a
little
tired
of
hearing
yourself
speak
do
you
mayor
chuckles
to
giles
that's
one
spunky
little
girl
you've
raised
i'm
gonna
eat
her
giles
grabs
wesley's
sword
from
the
table
and
thrusts
it
through
the
mayor's
chest
the
mayor
staggers
back
but
regains
his
balance
whoa
well
now
that
was
a
little
thoughtless
mayor
pulls
the
sword
out
of
his
chest
violent
outbursts
like
that
in

of
the
children
you
know
mr
giles

you
to
see
how
to
behave
get
out
the
mayor
takes
a
handkerchief
and
slowly
wipes
the
blood
from
the
sword
i
smell
fear
that's
smart
some
of
your
deaths
will
be
quick
if
that's
worth
anything

it
even
a
little
hard
for
you
how
can
you
ask
me
that
just
because
i'm
not
acting
like

i
don't
feel
it's
nice
to
know
what
you
thing
of
me
what
do
you
expect
me
to
say
when
you
just
attack
i
just
can't
do
this
anymore
i
can't
have
you
in
my
life
when
i'm
trying
to
move
on
the
sound
of
an
arrow
striking
the
arrow
was
fired
above
and
behind
angel
and
has
passed
through
his
back
so
the
point
sticks
out
the
front
of
his
jacket
he
falls
and
buffy
catches
him
angel
behind
a
neon
sign
atop
a
nearby

in

angel
sits

there
okay

buffy
grasps
the
arrow's

yeah
on

one
buffy
pulls
the
arrow
out
i
knew
you
were
going
to
do
that
not
too
much
blood
here
i
heal
pretty
fast
i
should
be
alright
buffy
while
swabbing
the
exit
wound
i'm
just
glad
faith's
such
a
suck
shot
you
sure
it
was
her
well
i've
narrowed
down
my
list
of
one
suspect
buffy
and
giles
continue
bandaging
angel
wesley
is
sitting
at
the
table
reading
fascinating
what
it
seems
our
mr
wirth
headed
an
expedition
in
hawaii
digging
in
old
lava
beds
near
a
dormant
volcano
i'm
not
fascinated
yet
he
found
something
underneath
a
carcass
buried
by
an
eruption
a
carcass
a
very
large
one
mr
wirth
posits
that
it
might
be
some
heretofore
undiscovered
dinosaur
a
demon
yes
that
would
be
something
that
the
mayor
would
want
to
keep
a
secret
if
it's
the
same
kind
of
demon
he's
turning
into
and
it's
dead
it
means
that
well
he's
only
impervious
to
harm
until
the
ascension
in
his
demon
form
he
can
be
killed
great
so
all
we
need
is
a
million
tons
of
burning
lava
we're
saved
well
it's
a
start
anyway
okay
you've
been
a
real
klutz
today

you're
burning
up
it's

miles
outside
of
boston
there
was
this
quarry
and

the
kids
used
to

there
was
this
one
rock
like
forty
feet
up
i
was
the
only
one
that
would
jump
off
it
all
the
older
kids
were

scared
not
you
though
naah
i
could
do
it
easy

i
might
when
i

bad
inside
like
i
might
vomit
welcome
