say
he
should
get
a
girlfriend
if
he
wasn't
so
old
well
we're
behind
you
people
scoff
at
things
like
school
spirit
but
look
at
these
girls
giving
their
all
like
this
he
notices
amber
doing
the
splits
between
two
chairs
ooo
stretchy
where
was
i
you
were
pretending
that
seeing
scantily
clad
girls
in
revealing
postures
was
a
spiritual
experience
who
said
i
was
pretending
xander
to
buffy
oh
hey
here's
a
good
luck
thing
for
tryouts
xander
hands
her
a
bracelet
what's
this
what's
that
oh
how
sweet
buffy
reads
the
inscription
'yours
always'
xander
iiit
came
that
way
really
they
all
said
that
willow
exhales
cordelia
approaches
them
just
look
at
that
amber
who
does
she
think
she
is
a
laker
girl
i
heard
she
turned
them
down
joy
the
cheerleading
squad
leader
steps
up
with
her
clipboard
and
calls
for
everyone's
attention
okay
listen
up
let's
begin
with
joy
checks
her
clipboard
amber
grove
if
you're
not
auditioning
move
off
the
floor
willow
to
amy
amy
hi
amy
comes
over
hi
i
didn't
know
you
wanted
to
be
a
cheerleader
you
lost
a
lot
of
weight
had
to
do
you
know
buffy
hi
hi
oh
how
i
hate
this
let
me
count
the
ways
amber
begins
her
routine
it's
very
athletic
she
starts
off
with
a
needle
split
lift
followed
by
a
double
spin
and
a
jumping
double
spin
after
landing
amber
launches
herself
into
an
aerial
and
a
cartwheel
jazz
slides
are
then
followed
by
a
single
spin
everyone
in
the
gym
is
intent
on
watching
her
amy
to
buffy
she
trained
with
benson
he's
one
of
the
best
coaches
money
can
buy
they
have
cheerleading
coaches
oh
yeah
don't
you
have
i
train
with
my
mom
three
hours
in
the
morning
three
at
night
hmm
that
much
quality
time
with
my
mom
would
probably
lead
to
some
quality
matricide
oh
i
know
it's
hokey
but
she's
really
great
cordelia
turns
away
from
amber
with
a
look
of
contempt
on
her
face
hmm
buffy
and
xander
watch
amber
in
amazement
amy
and
willow
are
impressed
too
amber's
hands
begin
to
smoke
what
the
that
girl's
on
fire
cordelia
facing
away
not
seeing
the
smoke
enough
of
the
hyperbole
amber's
hands
catch
fire
she
drops
her
pompoms
and
screams
buffy
reacts
amber
flails
her
hands
in
the
air
buffy
jumps
up
onto
the
stands
and
pulls
down
a
banner
she
runs
back
to
amber
knocks
her
down
and
snuffs
out
the
flames
with
the
banner
everyone
stares
in
shock
buffy
trying
to
comfort
amber
it's
okay
it's
okay
you're
gonna
be
okay
buffy
to
herself
god
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

the
library
buffy
is
pacing
willow
and
xander
are
sitting
at
the
table
i've
been
slaying
vampires
for
more
than
a
year
now
and
i
have
seen
some
pretty
cringe
worthy
things
but
nobody's
hands
ever
got
toasted
before
giles
comes
out
of
the
cage
i
imagine
not
so
this
isn't
a
vampire
problem
no
buffy
turns
to
giles
but
it
is
funky
right
not
of
the
norm
quite
spontaneous
human
combustion
is
is
rare
and
and
scientifically
unexplainable
but
there
have
been
cases
for
hundreds
of
years
usually
all
that's
left
is
a
pile
of
ashes
that's
all
that
would
have
been
left
if
it
hadn't
been
for
buffy
so
we
have
no
idea
what
caused
this
that's
a
comfort
but
that's
the
thrill
of
living
on
the
hellmouth
giles
sits
on
the
edge
of
the
table
there's
a
veritable
cornucopia
of
of
fiends
and
devils
and
and
ghouls
to
engage
giles
everyone
looks
at
him
pardon
me
for
finding
the
glass
half
full
any
common
denominators
in
cases
of
spontaneous
combustion
uh
rage
in
most
cases
the
person
who
combusted
was
was
terribly
angry
or
or
upset
so
maybe
amber's
got
this
power
to
make
herself
be
on
fire
it's
like
the
human
torch
only
it
hurts
i
need
to
get
the
skinny
on
amber
find
out
if
she's
had
any
colorful
episodes
before
buffy
starts
to
go
that
means
hacking
illegally
into
the
school's
computer
system
at
last
something
i
can
do
she
and
xander
get
up
and
go
over
to
buffy
i'll
ask
around
about
her
you
guys
don't
have
to
get
involved
what
d'ya
mean
we're
a
team
aren't
we
a
team
yeah
you're
the
slayer
and
we're
like
the
slayerettes
i
just
don't
like
putting
you
guys
in
danger
oh
huh
i
laugh
in
the
face
of
danger
then
i
hide
until
it
goes
away
okay
just
walk
softly
at
least
until
we
know
a
little
more
i
mean
what
if
amber
isn't
causing
these
problems
herself
well
then
we
have
to
determine
who
or
what
did
and
uh
deal
with
it
accordingly
cut
to
the
kitchen
at
the
summers
house
there
are
several
wooden
boxes
and
crates
joyce
is
trying
to
pry
one
open
with
a
crowbar
buffy
comes
in
hey

prying
at
the
crate
and
looks
at
buffy
some
activity
i
have
no
idea
i'm
sorry

okay
your
platitudes

all
occasions
joyce

prying

and
exhales

lotta

my
gallery's

gives
up
you
know
it
might
not
physically
kill
you
to
give
me
a
hand
here
joyce
goes
to
check
her
clipboard
buffy
grabs
the
lid
of
the
crate
and
effortlessly
tears
it
off
it
was
cheerleading
oh
good
i'm
glad
you're
taking
that
up
again
it'll
keep
you
out
of
trouble
i'm
not
in
trouble

buffy
is
hurt
her
mother
looks
up
from
her
clipboard
and
notices
i
mean
you
stopped
cheerleading
just
before
the
trouble
so
it's
good
you're
going
back
she
goes
back
to
the
crate
and
partially
lifts
out
a
statue
oh
dear
what
the
fertility
statue
you
don't
need
to
see
it
she
replaces
the
crate's
lid
and
goes
back
to
her
clipboard
y'know
there's
this
girl
amy
and
um
she
trains
with
her
mom
like
three
hours
a
day
uhhuh
sounds
like
her
mom's
pretty
into
it
sounds
like
her
mom
doesn't
have
a
lot
to
do
she
walks
out
of
the
kitchen
with
a
piece
of
art
buffy
lifts
the
crate's
lid
a
little
bit
and
looks
in
jeepers
cut
to
the
gym
the
next
day
tryouts
have
resumed
joy
pacing
despite
the
terrible
thing
that
happened
yesterday
we
still
have
to
pick
new
cheerleaders

amy
blows
the
cartwheel
and
crashes
into
cordelia

yelps
as
she
falls
and
then
quickly
gets
up

at

is
admiring
the
trophies
in
the
case
with
a
longing
look

single
pound
buffy
walks
around
to
face
amy
uh
she
sounds
really
great
amy
but
um

doesn't
mean
that

need
to
lock

cheerleading
thing
she
was
the
best
and
i
can't
get
my
body
to

hang
in
junior
high
when
her
mom
would
go
on
a
broth
kick
amy'd
come
over
to
my
house
and
we'd

nothing
thrilling
average
student
got
detention
once
for
smoking
regular
smoking
with
a
cigarette
not

being
smoky
hmm
all
pretty
normal
so
we
just
have
to
wait
and
we'll
see
what
happens
maybe
nothing
will
cut
to
the
girls'
locker
room
the
camera
shows
the
showers
dripping
cut
to
a
row
of
lockers
the
camera
follows
them
around
a
corner
to
amy
alone
at
her
locker
she
hears
a
noise
and
turns
to
look
nothing
the
showers
keep
dripping
amy
closes
her
locker
and
starts
to
go
but
is
surprised
by
cordelia
i
have
a
dream
it's
me
on
the
cheerleading
squad
adored
by
every
varsity
male
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
we
have
to
achieve
our
dreams
amy
otherwise
we
wither
and
die
look
i'm
sorry

scrunchie
into
an
open
locker

door
as
she
rounds
the
corner

just
a
figure
of
fun
xander

the
yearbook
staff

did
it

lot
of
fun

my
tip
mom

have
you
seen
the
kids
that
do
yearbook
nerds
pick
on
them
buffy

some
of
the
best

buffy
faces
her
mom
oh

own
thing
whatever
it

got
you
kicked
out
of
school
and
we
had
to
move
here
to
find
a
decent
school
that
would
take
you
buffy
is
hurt
she
takes
her
bag
and
starts
to
go
honey
uhhh
joyce
buffy
leaves
uhhh
great
parenting
form
little
shaky
on
the
dismount
cut
to
the
hall
at
school
cordelia
walks
past
willow
and
xander
in
a
daze
cordelia
you
haven't
been
mean
to
me
all
day
is
it
something
i've
done
xander
to
willow
okay
see
how
she
has
no
clue
that
i'm
even
a
mammal
much
less
a
human
being
willow
takes
the
pen
from
her
mouth
i
see
that
this
is
the
invisible
man
syndrome
a
blessing
in
cordelia's
case
a
curse
in
buffy's
willow
closes
her
locker
you're
not
invisible
to
buffy
she
chews
on
her
pen
some
more
as
they
start
to
walk
down
the
hall
it's
worse
i'm
just
like
a
part
of
the
scenery
like
an
old
shoe
or
a
rug
that
you
walk
on
every
day
but
don't
even
really
see
it
willow
takes
her
pen
out
of
her
mouth
like
a
pen
that's
all
chewed
up
and
you
know
you
should
throw
it
away
but
you
don't
not
'cause
you
like
it
so
much
more
'cause
you're
just
used
to
will
yeah
that
is
the
point
you
don't
have
to
drive
it
through
my
head
like
a
railroad
spike
i'm
gonna
take
your
advice
and
not
beat
around
the
bush
or
i
could
be
wrong
maybe
you
should
beat
around
the
bush
more
nah
i
gotta
be
a
man
and
ask
her
out
y'know
i
gotta
stop
giving
her
id
bracelets
uh
subtle
innuendos
taking
polaroids
outside
of
her
bedroom
window
late
at
night
that
last
part
is
a
joke
to
relieve
the
tension
because
here
she
comes
buffy

out
of
a
classroom
and
walks
toward
them
okay
into
battle

at

and
continues
chewing
on
her
pen

forward
burning
rubber
slow
down
slow
slow
turn
right
turn
right
cordelia
loses
control
as
the
car
races
along
the
course
knocking
down
cones
and
signs
buffy
begins
running
after
them
brakes
brakes
the
car
crashes
through
the
fence
and
bushes
out
onto
the
street
where
it
comes
to
a
sudden
halt
another
car
just
manages
to
swerve
around
them
everybody
out
they
all
get
out
cordelia
is
in
a
daze
and
she
walks
into
the
middle
of
the
street
a
delivery
van
is
coming
the
other
way
but
it
doesn't
slow
down
buffy
comes
running
cordelia
turns
to
see
the
van
coming
and
screams
buffy
leaps
over
the
driver's
ed
car
and
grabs
cordelia
pulling
her
down
and
out
of
the
way
the
van
takes
out
the
open
car
door
as
buffy
and
cordelia
roll
to
a
stop
oh
my
god
i
i
can't
see
anything
it's
it's
okay
it's
buffy
sees
cordelia's
eyes
oh
god
what's
happening
i
can't
see
anything
her
eyes
have
no
more
irises
and
are
completely
white
cut
to
the
library
the
team
is
sitting
at
the
table
witchcraft
blinding
your
enemy
to
disorient
and
disable
them
is
it's
classic
first
vampires
now
witches
no
wonder
you
can
still
afford
a
house
in
sunnydale
why
should
someone
want
to
harm
cordelia
maybe
because
they
met
her
did
i
say
that
and
setting
amber
ablaze
yeah
those
guys
don't
hang
they're
both
cheerleaders
someone
doesn't
like
cheerleading
or
likes
it
too
much
amy
amy
so
you
guys
are
leaning
towards
amy
she's
desperate
to
get
on
that
team
and
i've
got
this
feeling
she'd
do
just
about
anything
to
make
her
mom's
dream
come
true
uh
let
me
make
sure
i
have
this
right
this
witch
is
casting
horrible
and
disfiguring
spells
so
that
she
can
become
a
cheerleader
i
think
you're
underestimating
the
amount
of
pressure
a
parent
can
lay
on
you
if
you're
not
a
picture
perfect
carbon
copy
they
tend
to
wig
cheerleading
was
kind
of
her
mom's
last
hurrah
look
we
still
have
to
stop
amy
we
should
grab
her
and
giles
interrupts
i
think
we
should
be
sure
she's
the
witch
before
we
arouse
her
suspicions
she's
she's
capable
of
some
fairly
unpleasant
things
okay
alright
buffy

desperate
to

buffy
laughs
nervously
and
drops
her
pencil
oops
she
crouches
down
to
pick
up
the
pencil
she
reaches
into
amy's
bag
and
pulls
some
hair
off
of
her
brush
she
gets
up
and
tries
to
pretend
nothing
happened
she
glances
at
amy
to
gauge
her
reaction
amy
smiles
back
weakly
she
noticed
but
pretends
she
didn't
buffy
waves
her
pencil
and
smiles
back
she
heads
back
to
her
lab
table
with
an
expression
of
relief
at
having
avoided
a
close
call
she
puts
the
hair
on
willow's
bench
as
she
walks
by
willow
picks
up
the
hair
and
mixes
it
into
the
concoction
amy
looks
back
at
them
to
see
what
they're
doing
willow
and
xander
look
back
nervously
xander
in
a
low
voice
wave
'hi'
to
the
nice
little
witch
amy
overhears
and
gives
them
another
quick
look
willow
takes
the
beaker
and
pours
some
of
the
liquid
into
a
testtube
all
set
willow
hands
the
tube
to
buffy
do
you
have
a
plan
spill
it
on
her
try
'n'
make
it
look
natural
we're
right
behind
you
only
further
back
buffy
slowly
makes
her
way
over
to
amy
lishanne
can
you
tell
me
why
these
chemicals
have
this
reaction
buffy
pours
some
of
the
mixture
onto
amy's
arm
and
feigns
an
accident
drawing
in
her
breath
she
sees
the
liquid
turn
blue
on
contact
lishanne
amy
apparently
didn't
notice
the
spill
she's
looking
over
at
lishanne
are

god
buffy
looks
over
at
lishanne
now
too
and
sees
her
shaking
her
head
violently
she
turns
to
the
camera
and
everyone
sees
that
she
no

has
a
mouth
buffy
stares
in
amazement
she
looks
back
at
amy

buffy
buffy

keeps
the
cloth
in
place
with
her
hand
we've
gotta
get
her
to
a
hospital
they
can't
help
her
this
is
a
bloodstone
vengeance
spell
giles
takes
her
pulse
hits
the
body
hard
like
a
a
quart
of
alcohol
and
then
it
eeradicates
the
uh
immune
system
a
vengeance
spell
like
she's
trying
to
get
even
with
buffy
'cause
she
knows
i
know
she's
a
witch
the
others
she
just
wanted
out
of

running

of
hours
three
at
most
well
how
do
we
reverse
the
spell
giles

uh
we
can
reverse

giles
takes
off
his
glasses
and
rubs
his
eyes
we
can
just
lay
our
hands
on
on
amy's
spell
book
and
if
we
can't
get
a
hold
of
it
well
the
other
way
is
to
cut
the
witch's
head
off
giles
puts
his
glasses
back
on
show
of
hands
xander
raises

spell
leaps
from
her
hands
and
is
reflected
by
the
mirror
back
at
her
the
power
of
the
spell
envelops
her
and
she
screams
the
energy
twists
around
her
and
disappears
with
a
roar
taking
her
with
it
buffy
surveys
the
scene
amy
is
badly
shaken
buffy
sees
giles
unconscious
on
the
floor
he
wakes
up
well
that
was
um
interesting
buffy
gives
him
her
hand
and
helps
him
up
you
guys
okay
i'm
fine
i
assume
the
uh
all
the
spells
are
reversed
it
was
my
first
casting
so
giles
inhales
i
may
have
got
it
wrong
you
saved
my
life
you
were
a
god
well
i
didn't
think
you'd
pull
it
off
suddenly
xander
comes
rushing
in
and
grabs
amy
tightly
i
got
her
i
got
her
cut
her
head
off
xander
what
are
you
doing
saving
you
get
your
hands
off
of
her
but
she's
evil
it
wasn't
exactly
her
i
was
my
mom
oh
xander
releases
her
now
willow
comes
running
in
too
wielding
a
bat
where
is
she
uh
hey
willow
it's
cool
it
is
yeah
i
took
care
of
it
they
all
just
look
at
each
other
cut
to
buffy's
room
she
scoops
her
smashed
alarm
clock
into
a
wastebasket
her
mother
comes
in
i
don't
get
it
what
i've
been
doing
a
lot
of
thinking
about
where
you're
coming
from
how
to
relate
to
you
and
i've
come
to
a
very
simple
conclusion
i
don't
get
it
i'm
inscrutable
huh
you're
sixteen
i
think
there's
a
a
biological
imperative
whereby
i
can't
understand
you
because
i'm
not
sixteen
do
you
ever
wish
you
could
be
sixteen
again
oh
that's
a
frightful
notion
joyce
exhales
go
through
all
that
again
not
even
if
it
helped
me
understand
you
she
smiles
at
her
daughter
and
buffy
smiles
back
i
love
you
mom
she
jumps
up
and
kisses
her
mom
on
the
cheek
then
runs
from
the
room
i
don't
get
it
cut
to
the
school
halls
buffy
and
amy
are
walking
together
my
dad
is
so
impossible
he
doesn't
ever
want
me
going
anywhere
he
wants
to
spend
total
quantity
time
together
and
i'm
like
'dad
i
can
go
out
it's
perfectly
safe'
but
he's
got
all
this
guilt
about
leaving
me
with
my
mom
and
he's
being
a
total
pain
you're
loving
it
every
single
minute
cut
to
another
part
of
the
hall
this
saturday
night
he
wants
to
stay
in
and
make
brownies
well
the
brownies
were
my
idea
cordelia
comes
up
behind
them
hey
i'm
really
sorry
you
guys
got
bumped
back
to
alternate
cordelia
reconsiders
hold
it
wait
no
i'm
not
well
i
know
that
i'll
miss
the
intellectual
thrill
of
spelling
out
words
with
my
arms
ooo
these
grapes
are
sour
buffy
and
amy
stop
at
the
trophy
case
while
cordelia
continues
on
amy
to
buffy
oh
i'm
sorry
i
forgot
that
you
wanted
to
be
on
the
squad
oh
hey
that's
okay
cheerleading's
just
a
little
too
hairy
for
me
these
days
amy
takes
a
breath
that's
for
sure
they
go
around
to
the
front
of
the
case
and
look
at
catherine's
picture
catherine
the
great
and
there's
been
no
sign
of
her
that
last
spell
she
said
i'd
never
make
trouble
again
wherever
she
is
i
don't
think
we'll
have
to
worry
they
look
at
catherine's
cheerleading
trophy
twisted
they
turn
and
go
i'm
just
happy
to
have
my
body
back
i'm
thinking
of
getting
fat
y'know
i
hear
that
look's
in
for
spring
the
camera
closes
in
on
the
cheerleading
trophy
catherine's
eyes
are
looking
out
and
she's
making
muffled
noises
the
end
