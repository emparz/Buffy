prologue

underwater
copious
amounts
of
bubbles
rise
through
it
some
larger
some
smaller
as
though
someone
below
is
doing
their
best
to
hold
their
breath
but
can't
continue
for
much
longer
the
camera
pans
down
and
there
is
buffy
frantically
trying
to
get
to
the
surface
below
her
allan
grabs
her
ankle
and
pulls
her
down
she
kicks
her
legs
and
flails
her
arms
desperately
trying
to
shake
loose
eventually
she
manages
to
break
free
of
his
grip
and
swim
to
the
surface
she
breaks
through
and
draws
a
deep
breath
there
kneeling
on
the
dock
above
she
sees
faith
who
reaches
down
and
shoves
her
back
underwater
cut
to
buffy's
room
she
wakes
with
a
start
from
the
nightmare
and
draws
several
deep
breaths
to
calm
herself
as
she
realizes
it
was
all
just
a
dream
she
sits
up
in
bed
and
looks
around
her
room
she
pushes
the
blankets
back

up
and
walks
out
into
the
hall
where
she
can
hear
the

way
faith
walks
out
of
the
classroom
leaving
a
shocked
buffy
behind
cut
to
the
hall
buffy
comes
out
of
the
classroom
and
walks
toward
the
student
lounge
there
she
sees
willow
sitting
alone
on
a
couch
and
goes
to
her
willow
notices
her
coming
glances
up
for
an
instant
and
takes
a
deep
breath
as
she
pretends
to
go
back
to
her
reading
apprehensive
about
them
meeting
hey
hey
willow
buffy
sits
where's
faith
ii
saw
her
around
figured
you
two
were
gonna
go

more
nasty
stuff
not

now
ii
um
i
think
she
bailed
they
both
begin
to
talk
again
simultaneously
willow
i
was
won
actually
i'm
they
both
stop
buffy
lets
out
a
deep
breath
um
you
go
ahead
willow
puts
her
book
away
i'm
late
ii'm
meeting
michael
the
warlock
guy
we're
still
trying
to
derat
amy
buffy
smiles
thinly
okay
neither
of
them
says
anything
for
a
long
moment
willow
evasively
so
see
ya
willow
gets
up
and
goes
buffy
to
herself
see
you
cut
to
the
scene
where
allan
was
killed
the
red
and
blue
flashing
lights
of
police
car
light
bars
illuminate
the
area
a
forensic
expert
takes
blood
and
fiber
samples
from
the
dumpster
as
another
police
officer
holds
a
maglite
up
to
it
detective
stein
is
also
there
interviewing
a
potential
witness
so
uh
you
heard
the
man
scream
about
what
time
last
night
woman
worriedly
oh
i'm
not
sure
700
maybe
800
can
you
be
more
specific
say
between
730
and
800
the
camera
moves
through
the
scene
and
finds
angel
watching
from
a
distance
he
sees
the
blood
on
the
dumpster
and
watches
as
the
samples
are
taken
he
flashes
back
to
the
previous
night
when
he
saw
the
blood
on
buffy's
hand
your
hand
oh
it's
okay
he's
back
in
the
present
and
continues
to
watch
all
the
activity
cut
to
city
hall
cut
to
the
mayor's
office
he
puts
a
sheet
of
paper
into
the
shredder
and
listens
to
it
whir
through
he
follows
it
with
another
the
camera
pans
up
to
his
face
he's
not
a
happy
mayor
it's
not
working
it's
supposed
to
do
something
besides
shred
it's
supposed
to
cheer
me
up
usually
using
the
shredder
gives
me
a
lift
it's
fun
and
today
you're
not
getting
the
yayas
mayor
wilkins
morosely
no
he
shreds
another
sheet
guess
it'll
take
more
than
this
to
turn
my
frown
upside
down
i
just
don't
understand
why
allan
would
leave
such
a
paper
trail
about
our
dealings
mayor
wilkins
considers
do
you
think
he
was
gonna
betray
me
oh
now
that's
a
horrible
thought
and
now
he's
dead
i'll
never
have
the
chance
to
scold
him
maybe
this
will
change
your
mood
he
drops
a
copy
of
the
coroner's
report
on
the
desk
the
mayor
picks
it
up
and
opens
it
what
is
it
bombshell
the
deputy
mayor
had
wooden
splinters
in
his
wound
struck
right
through
the
heart
with
a
sharp
pointed
object
now
word
is
someone
was
fighting
vampires
not
a
block
away
from
the
scene
any
smart
money
says
it
was
a
slayer
who
did
this
job
why
do
you
think
he
talked
to
them
if
he
did
i'm
thinking
he
said
the
wrong
thing
mayor
wilkins
closes
the
report
well
this
is
exciting
a
slayer
up
for
murder
one
that's
sunshine
and
roses
to
me
it
really
is
he
laughs
as
he
taps
the
end
of
the
report
on
his
desk
and
sets
it
down
part
2

city
hall
at
night
cut
to
allan's
office
faith
and
buffy
break
in
buffy
closes
the
door
behind
them
checking
to
make
sure
they
weren't
seen
she
turns
on
the
light
they
both
look
around
the
office
faith
darkly
i'm
telling
you
we
did
the
world
a
favor
faith
goes
to
his
chair
this
guy
was
about
as
interesting
as
watching
paint
dry
buffy
uneasily
faith
i'm
joking
jeez
lighten
up
a
little
b
she
looks
across
his
desk
and
notices
a
picture
of
him
with
the
mayor
buffy
goes
through
the
papers
in
his
inbox
faith
picks
up
the
picture
and
stares
at
it
cradling
it
gently
he
came
out
of
nowhere
buffy
sympathetically
i
know
faith
annoyed
whatever
faith
puts
down
the
picture
i'm
not
lookin'
to
hug
and
cry
and
learn
and
grow
i'm
just
saying
it
happened
quick
you
know
she
pulls
open
his
drawer
everything
inside
is
neat
and
in
place
buffy
starts
to
go
through
some
papers
lying
on
top
of
his
filing
cabinets
faith
loses
her
patience
you
know
what
let's
just
blow
who
cares
what
this
guy
was
about
it's
kind
of
moot
now
don't
you
think
i
don't
think
he
was
in
that
alley
by
chance
i
think
he
was
looking
for
us
i'd
like
to
know
why
she
opens
a
file
drawer
it's
empty
so
what
you
think
there's
some
big
conspiracy
buffy
closes
the
drawer
and
opens
another
all
the
folders
in
it
are
also
empty
you
were
saying
so
his
papers
are
gone
that
doesn't
prove
anything
except
that
somebody
didn't
want
us
to
prove
anything
faith
begins
to
get
it
cut
to
the
hall
buffy
opens
the
door
and
peeks
out
the
hall
is
clear
so
she
steps
out
into
it
just
then
the
mayor's
door
opens
further
down
the
hall
and
mr
trick
steps
out
the
mayor
is
right
behind
him
buffy
looks
back
at
faith
and
they
both
scramble
back
into
allan's
office
and
close
the
door
quietly
they
can
still
hear
them
talking
out
in
the
hall
get
as
many
men
on
it
as
you
can
yeah
we'll
be
wanting
to
turn
up
the
heat
cut
to
the
streets
buffy
and
faith
step
off
the
sidewalk
and
into
the
street
so
the
mayor
of
sunnydale
is
a
black
hat
that's
a
shocker
huh
actually
yeah
i
didn't
get
the
bad
guy
vibe
off
of
him
faith
exasperated
when
are
you
gonna
learn
b
it
doesn't
matter
what
kind
of
vibe
you
get
off
a
person
'cause
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
face
they're
showing
you
is
not
the
real
one
they
step
up
onto
the
opposite
sidewalk
buffy
evenly
i
guess
you
know
a
lot
about
that
faith
stops
and
faces
buffy
what
is
that
supposed
to
mean
it's
just
look
at
you
faith
less
than
twentyfour
hours
ago
you
killed
a
man
aand
now
it's
all
zipadeedoodah
it's
not
your
real
face
and
i
know
it
look
i
know
what
you're
feeling
because
i'm
feeling
it
too
faith
insolently
do
you
so
fill
me
in
'cause
i'd
like
to
hear
this
dirty
like
something
sick
creeped
inside
you
and
you
can't
get
it
out
and
you
keep
hoping
that
it
was
just
some
nightmare
but
it
wasn't
and
we
are
gonna
have
to
figure
out
faith
interrupts
is
there
gonna
be
an
intermission
in
this
just
let
me
talk
to
giles
okay
i
swear
no
we're
not
bringing
anybody
else
into
this
you
gotta
keep
your
head
b
this
is
all
gonna
blow
over
in
a
few
days
and
if
it
doesn't
if
it
doesn't
faith
shrugs
they
got
a
freighter
leaving
the
docks
at
least
twice
a
day
it
ain't
fancy
but
it
gets
you
gone
buffy
in
disbelief
and
that's
it
you
just
live
with
it
you
see
the
dead
guy
in
your
head
every
day
for
the
rest
of
your
life
faith
steps
closer
buffy
i'm
not
gonna
see
anything
i
missed
the
mark
last
night
and
i'm
sorry
about
the
guy
i
really
am
but
it
happens
anyway
how
many
people
do
you
think
we've
saved
by
now
thousands
and
didn't
you
stop
the
world
from
ending
because
in
my
book
that
puts
you
and
me
in
the
plus
column
we
help
people
it
doesn't
mean
we
can
do
whatever
we
want
why
not
the
guy
i
offed
was
no
gandhi
i
mean
we
just
saw
he
was
mixed
up
in
dirty
dealings
maybe
but
what
if
he
was
coming
to
us
for
help
what
if
he
was
you're
still
not
seeing
the
big
picture
b
something
made
us
different
we're
warriors
we're
built
to
kill
to
kill
demons
but
it
does
not
mean
that
we
get
to
pass
judgment
on
people
like
we're
better
than
everybody
else
we
are
better
buffy
is
taken
aback
faith
exhilarated
that's
right
better
people
need
us
to
survive
in
the
balance
nobody's
gonna
cry
over
some
random
bystander
who
got
caught
in
the
crossfire
buffy
sadly
i
am
faith
disdainfully
well
that's
your
loss
she
turns
her
back
on
buffy
and
walks
away
cut
to
buffy's
house
her
mother
sees
her
coming
and
meets
her
at
the
door
when
she
opens
it
buffy
can
see
detective
stein
standing
behind
her
buffy
buffy
looks
at
him
eyes
widening
remembering
him
from
before
cut
to
the
living
room
joyce
sits
in
an
armchair
with
her
feet
together
and
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
listening

completely
understand
why
you
and
faith
have
been
doing
the
bonding
thing
you
guys
work
together
you
you
should
get
along
it's
more
complicated
than
that
but
see
it's
that
exact
thing
thatthat's
just
ticking
me
off
it's
this
whole
'slayers
only'
attitude
i
mean
since
when
wouldn't
i
understand
you
you
talk
to
me
about
everything
iit's
like
all
of
a
sudden
ii'm
not
cool
enough
for
you
because
i
can't
kill
things
with
my
bare
hands
buffy
suddenly
bursts
into
tears
willow
is
aghast
at
this
result
willow
regretfully
oh
oh
buffy
don't
cry
willow
hugs
her
close
i'm
sorry
ii
was
too
hard
on
you
willow
lets
go
sometimes
i
unleash
ii

my
own
strength
iiit's
bad
iii'm
bad
i'm
a
bad
bad
bad
person
willow
looks
for
forgiveness
buffy
tearfully
will
i'm
in
trouble
cut
to
later
after
they've
calmed
down
and
buffy's
explained
they
sit
on
willow's
bed
and
faith
acts
like
she
doesn't
even
care
the
way
she
talks
it's
like
she
didn't
even
make
a
mistake
willow
takes
it
all
in
do
you
think
she's
like
iin
shock
buffy
sighs
i
don't
know
and
i
think
that
detective
knows
more
than
he's
saying
i
think
he
knew
that
i
was
lying
willow
decisively
you
have
to
go
to
giles
buffy
he'll
know
what
to
do
buffy
lets
out
a
deep
breath
knowing
that
her
friend
is
right
cut
to
the
library
buffy
comes
in
quietly
and
walks
past
the
counter
buffy
troubled
giles
she
stops
when
she
sees
him
come
out
of
his
office
buffy
uh
buffy
exhales
i
don't
really
know
how
to
say
this
so
i'm
i'm
i'm
just
gonna
say
it
i
know
i've
kept
things
from
you
before
but
giles
turns
his
head
slightly
as
faith
comes
out
of
his
office
too
faith
gives
her
a
steely
look
like
she
expects
buffy
to
keep
things
quiet
buffy
fumbling
but
um
but
ii've
been
blowing
off
my
classes
you
know
inin
the
sense
of
not
attending
and
uh
it's
okay
buffy
i
told
him
buffy
surprised
you
told
him
i
had
to
he
had
to
know
what
you
did
buffy
confused
what
i
did
she
realizes
that
faith
has
told
giles
a
baldfaced
lie
giles
no
thathat's
just
not
what
happened
giles
upset
i
don't
want
to
hear
it
buffy
buffy
shocked
no
it
i
don't
want
to
hear
any
more
lies
buffy
frantically
to
faith
you
can't
be
serious
you're
setting
me
up
get
in
my
office
now
faith
i'll
talk
to
you
in
the
morning
buffy
imploringly
giles
please
you
have
to
giles
sternly
now
buffy
can't
believe
what's
happening
faith
walks
around
giles
buffy
goes
into
his
office
faith
stops
and
faces
him
um
sorry
she
leaves
at
a
brisk
pace
giles
looks
down
for
a
moment
then
goes
into
his
office
inside
buffy
faces
him
buffy
desperately
giles
i
didn't
do
this
i
swear
look
i
know
that
i
messed
up
badly
but
the
murder
iit
it
was
giles
interrupts
faith
i
know
stunned
buffy
realizes
he
was
just
playing
faith's
game
she
may
have
many
talents
buffy
but
fortunately
lying
is
not
one
of
them
oh
oh
god
buffy
sits
i
thought
i'm
sorry
i
needed
her
to
think
that
i
was
on
her
side
i
don't
know
how
far
she'll
take
this
charade
try
far
like
all
the
way
you
should
have
come
to
me
right
off
giles
sits
facing
her
i
know
well
i
i
wanted
to
but
faith
wouldn't
hear
of
it
it's
not
all
her
fault
giles
we
both
thought
it
was
a
vampire
ii
only
realized
it
a
second
before
buffy
this
is
not
the
first
time
something
like
this
has
happened
buffy
confused
it's
not
the
slayer
is
on
the
front
line
of
a
nightly
war
now
it's
it's
tragic
but
accidents
have
happened
wwhat
do
you
do
well
the
council
investigates
um
metes
out
punishment
if
punishment
is
due
but
i
i
have
no
plans
to
involve
them
i
mean
it's
the
last
thing
faith
needs
at
the
moment
she's
unstable
buffy
i
mean
she's
utterly
unable
to
accept
responsibility
she's
freaking
so
so
then
we
just
have
to
help
her
deal
right
she's
in
denial
there
is
no
help
for
her
until
she
admits
what
happened
buffy
uncertainly
ii
could
talk
to
her
giles
sighs
perhaps
or
maybe
i'm
too
close
maybe
maybe
one
of
the
guys
could
we
should
meet
itit
may
be
that
they're
seeing
a
different
side
of
her
okay
cut
to
the
main
area
looking
into
the
office
the
camera
pans
past
the
window
in
the
meantime
no
one
else
is
to
know
understood
of
course
the
camera
keeps
panning
until
it
comes
to
rest
on
wesley
who
is
standing
by
the
counter
arms
crossed
and
listening
grimly
i
mean
this
is
extremely
delicate
if
we
scare
her
off
now
we
may
lose
her
forever

and

exasperated
monk
just
put
him
on
will
you
this
is
an
emergency
well
maybe
we
should
all
talk
to
faith
together
cut
to
the
cafeteria
she
buffy
xander
and
giles
sit
among
the
tables
which
have
the
chairs
inverted
on
them
for
the
night
you
mean
like
that
intervention
thing
that
you
guys
did
on
me
as
i
recall
xander
and
i
nearly
came
to
blows
uh
you
nearly
came
to
blows
buffy
i
nearly
came
to
loss
of
limbs
no
faith
is
too
defensive
for
a
confrontation
like
that
she'll
respond
better
to
a
oneonone
approach
well
i
can
be
the
one
on
her
one
xander
gets
confused
looks
let's
rephrase
i
think
she
might
listen
to
me
we
kind
of
have
um
a
connection
a
connection
why
would
you
think
that
xander
interrupts
i'm
just
saying
it's
worth
a
shot
that's
all
buffy
and
willow
exchange
a
look
no
i
don't
i
don't
see
it
xander
i
mean
of
of
all
of
us
you're
the
one
person
arguably
that
faith
has
had
the
least
contact
with
yeah
but
we
hung
out
a
little
recently
and
she
seemed
to
be
um
responsive
willow
picks
up
on
that
and
figures
it
out
she
looks
sadly
off
into
space
when
did
you
guys
hang
out
oh
she
was
fighting
one
of
those
uh
apocalypse
demon
things
and
i
helped
her
gave
her
a
ride
home
and
you
guys
talked
xander
shakes
his
head
not
extensively
no
then
why
would
you
buffy
figures
it
out
also
widens
her
eyes
with
surprise
oh
giles
gets
it
surprised
oh
he
and
buffy
both
look
at
willow
concerned
she
notices
and
looks
up
i
don't
need
to
say
'oh'
i
got
it
before
they
slept
together
buffy
is
genuinely
sorry
that
she
had
to
hear
it
like
this
willow
looks
back
off
into
space
a
long
silence
follows
the
tension
in
the
air
is
very
thick
giles
finally
breaks
it
fine
fine
let's
let's
let's
move
on
alright
look
ii
know
that
you
mean
well
xander
but
um
ii
just
don't
see
faith
opening
up
to
you
buffy
gently
she
doesn't
take
the
guys
that
she
has
a
'connection'
with
very
seriously
and
they're
they're
kind
of
a
big
joke
to
her
no
offense
xander
guffaws
sarcastically
oh
no
i
mean
why
would
i
be
offended
by
that
however
iif
you
still
want
to
be
of
assistance
i
i
i
need
some
help
with
research
there's
still
the
business
of
the
mayor
and
mr
trick
to
attend
to
yeah
they
they
seemed
pretty
cozy
the
other
night
yes
uh
willow
cccan
you
um
access
the
mayor's
files
willow
comes
back
to
earth
what
oh
uh
sure
i
can
try
giles
stands
up
good
yes
because
clearly
we
uh
giles
picks
up
his
chair
we
need
to
take
a
harder
look
at
him
giles
turns
it
over
he's
he's
um
he's
obviously
up
to
something
giles
sets
it
on
a
table
what
about
faith
giles
sighs
i
don't
know
i
need
time
she
needs
help
now
buffy
giles
looks
at
her
i
owe
her
that
cut
to
the
girls'
bathroom
the
camera
pulls
in
to
a
stall
with
its
door
not
quite
closed
wish
we
never
met
by
kathleen
wilhoite
plays
over
the
scene
disappointment
stops
by
from
time
to
time
the
sound
of
sobbing
is
coming
from
inside
the
stall
cut
inside
willow
sits
there
crying
her
eyes
out
to
see
how
i'm
doing
and
he
came
by
last
night
right
after
you
left
my
life
in
ruin
cut
to
the
library
xander
sits
on
the
steps
to
the
stack
level
staring
off
into
space
and
tapping
his
fingers
when
i
don't
get
what
i
want
cut
to
faith's
room
she's
lying
on
her
bed
idly
watching
tv
the
spoiled
child
inside
breaks
down
she
hears
a
knock
at
her
door
she
rolls
off
her
bed
and
goes
to
answer
it
it's
xander
faith
bored
what
xander
awkwardly
i
just
uh
came
by
to
see
how
you
are
actually
faith
with
hostility
i'm
sick
of
people
asking
me
that
for
one
thing
a
long
moment
of
silence
ensues
can
i
come
in
just
to
talk
i
promise
faith
skeptical
like
you
could
make
something
happen
if
i
didn't
want
it
to
hey
yeah
got
me
there
pretty
much
not
gonna
try
to
take
you
under
any
circumstances
xander
holds
out
his
arm
see
here
feel
that
xander
points
to
his
biceps
probably
like
a
wet
noodle
to
you
huh
faith
steps
aside
five
minutes
that's
all
i
need
xander
comes
in
for
talking
and
conversation
xander
faith
closes
the
door
i'm
um
quick
as
a
bunny
faith
turns
off
the
tv
clock
is
running
it's
just
uh
i
heard
about
what
happened
and
i
thought
you
might
need
a
friend
so
then
go
talk
to
buffy
she's
the
one
who
killed
a
guy
yeah
i
heard
that
version
faith
not
amused
version
xander
sighs
either
way
iit
sounds
like
it
was
an
accident
and
that's
the
important
part
faith
angrily
no
the
important
part
is
that
buffy
is
the
faith
makes
finger
quotes
accidental
murderer
faith
you
may
not
think
so
but
i
sort
of
know
you
and
i've
seen
you
postbattle
and
i
know
firsthand
that
you're
um
like
a
wild
thing
and
half
the
time
you
don't
know
what
you're
doing
faith
snidely
and
you're
living
proof
of
that
aren't
you
see
you're
trying
to
hurt
me
but
right
now
you
need
someone
on
your
side
what
happened
wasn't
your
fault
and
i'm
willing
to
testify
to
that
in
court
if
you
need
me
you'd
dig
that
wouldn't
you
faith
gives
him
a
sexy
look
to
get
up
in
front
of
all
your
geek
pals
and
go
on
record
about
how
i
made
you
my
boy
toy
for
a
night
no
nnnnno
that's
not
it
i
know
what
this
is
all
about
faith
steps
closer
you
just
came
by
here
faith
runs
her
fingertips
all
around
his
face
'cause
you
want
another
taste
don't
you
no
i
mean
it
was
nice
it
was
great
it
was
kind
of
a
blur
but
okay
some
day
sure
yay
but
not
now
not
like
this
faith
grabs
hold
of
his
head
more
like
how
then
lights
on
or
off
kinks
or
vanilla
xander
jerks
away
faith
come
on
i
came
here
to
help
you
xander
looks
her
in
the
eyes
i
thought
we
had
a
connection
faith
can't
help
but
think
that's
funny
and
laughs
at
his
gullibility
she
grabs
him
by
his
shirt
front
shoves
him
onto
the
bed
and
jumps
on
top
of
him
faith
excitedly
you
wanna
feel
a
connection
it's
just
skin
faith
opens
his
shirt
i
see
i
want
i
take
faith
kisses
him
hard
i
forget
she
keeps
moving
above
him
and
rubbing
his
chest
and
shoulders
xander
nervously
no
no
wait
it
was
more
than
that
i
could
do
anything
to
you
right
now
and
you
want
me
to
i
can
make
you
scream
she
licks
her
tongue
over
and
around
his
face
and
returns
to
his
lips
and
kisses
him
forcefully
seizing
his
lower
lip
between
her
teeth
and
pulling
at
it
faith
breathlessly
i
could
make
you
die
she
kisses
him
again
and
gets
her
hand
around
his
neck
when
she
pulls
away
from
his
lips
he's
choking
she
kisses
him
once
more
and
then
rises
above
him
never
letting
up
on
her
chokehold
xander
reaches
up
with
one
hand
to
try
to
push
her
away
and
tries
to
pry
her
hand
from
his
neck
with
his
other
hand
but
doesn't
have
anywhere
near
the
strength
necessary
to
do
so
faith
has
both
hands
tight
around
his
neck
now
and
squeezes
hard
he
begins
to
lose
consciousness
a
few
moments
more
and
he's
passed
out
faith
hears
a
noise
behind
her
and
looks
over
just
in
time
to
be
knocked
unconscious
by
angel
cut
to
angel's
mansion
faith
is
chained
to
the
fireplace
mantle
she
rubs
her
wrists
finally
decided
to
tie
me
up
huh
i
always
knew
you
weren't
really
a
oneslayer
guy
angel
plays
with
a
bat
i'm
sorry
about
the
chains
it's
not
that
i
don't
trust
you
actually
it
is
that
i
don't
trust
you
angel
sets
the
bat
aside
the
thing
with
xander
i
know
what
it
looked
like
but
we
were
just
playing
angel
evenly
and
he
forgot
the
safety
word
angel
gets
up
is
that
it
angel
walks
over
to
her
safety
words
are
for
wusses
angel
crouches
before
her
i
bet
you're
not
big
on
trust
games
now
are
you
faith
you
gonna
shrink
me
now
is
that
it
no
i
just
wanna
talk
to
you
that's
what
they
all
say
and
then
it's
just
'lemme
stay
the
night
won't
try
anything'
angel
you
wanna
go
the
long
way
around
hey
i
can
do
that
faith
stands
up
i'm
not
getting
any
older
he
turns
his
back
on
her
and
walks
out
into
the
atrium
buffy
waits
there
and
stands
up
when
she
sees
him
how's
she
doing
it's
like
talking
to
a
wall
only
you
get
more
from
a
wall
but
you'll
keep
trying
right
sure
we're
just
getting
started
so
what
do
i
do
look
right
now
there's
nothing
that
you
can
do
well
this
could
take
awhile
right
buffy
goes
to
the
stairs
so
i'll
just
go
to
faith's
and
i'll
get
some
of
her
stuff
that
way
she'll
see
that
we're
on
her
side
that's
a
good
idea
okay
buffy
glances
at
faith
i'll
be
back
look
i
i
don't
want
you
to
get
your
hopes
up
buffy
she
may
not
want
us
to
help
her
she
does
she
just
doesn't
know
how
to
say
it
she
killed
a
man
that
changes
everything
for
her
buffy
shakes
her
head
giles
said
with
counseling
they
might
not
even
need
to
lock
her
up
that's
not
what
i
mean
she's
taken
a
life
i
know
she's
got
a
taste
for
it
now
cut
to
the
mayor's
office
he
and
trick
are
reviewing
a
security
camera
tape
on
it
they
see
buffy
and
faith
enter
allan's
office
not
one
slayer
but
two
right
here
in
the
building
there
was
supposed
to
be
a
guard
sh
here
comes
my
favorite
part
mayor
wilkins
they
see
them
hide
in
allan's
office
where
the
slayers
see
us
in
the
hall
together
thick
as
thieves
oh
wait
we
are
thieves
and
worse
and
now
they
know
it
well
they're
not
gonna
be
much
of
a
threat
in
jail
well
we
don't
have
near
enough
evidence
to
put
'em
away
on
the
tape
he
and
trick
walk
out
of
the
building
no
you're
gonna
have
to
come
up
with
a
more
efficient
solution
and
mr
trick
you
better
think
of
it
soon
they
watch
the
tape
where
the
two
slayers
leave
the
office
after
they've
gone
cut
to
angel's
mansion
he
paces
past
faith
i
know
what's
goin'
on
with
you
join
the
club
everybody
seems
to
have
a
theory
hmm
angel
faces
her
but
i
know
what
it's
like
to
take
a
life
to
feel
a
future
a
world
of
possibilities
snuffed
out
by
your
own
hand
i
know
the
power
in
it
the
exhilaration
it
was
like
a
drug
for
me
faith
looks
up
at
him
sarcastically
yeah
sounds
like
you
need
some
help
a
professional
maybe
hmm
angel
goes
to
the
coffee
table
a
professional
couldn't
have
helped
me
angel
sits
on
it
it
stopped
when
i
got
my
soul
back
my
human
heart
goody
for
you
if
we're
gonna
party
let's
get
on
with
it
faith
holds
out
her
wrists
otherwise
could
you
let
me
out
of
these
things
faith
you
have
a
choice
you've
tasted
something
few
ever
do
angel
stands
up
paces
i
mean
to
kill
without
remorse
is
to
feel
like
a
god
faith
struggles
angrily
right
now
all
i
feel
is
a
cramp
in
my
wrist
faith
yanks
at
the
chains
impatiently
so
let
me
go
angel
crouches
but
you're
not
a
god
you're
not
much
more
than
a
child
going
down
this
path
will
ruin
you
you
can't
imagine
the
price
for
true
evil
yeah
faith
sneering
i
hope
evil
takes
mastercard
angel
smiles
you
and
me
faith
angel
straightens
up
we're
a
lot
alike
time
was
i
thought
humans
existed
just
to
hurt
each
other
angel
sits
next
to
her
but
then
i
came
here
and
i
found
out
that
there
are
other
types
of
people
people
who
genuinely
wanted
to
do
right
angel
looks
at
her
and
they
make
mistakes
and
they
fall
down
you
know
but
they
keep
caring
keep
trying
if
you
can
trust
us
faith
this
can
all
change
you
don't
have
to
disappear
into
the
darkness
suddenly
there
is
a
loud
pounding
on
the
door
it
is
broken
in
and
wesley
strides
straight
toward
them
holding
a
large
cross
and
flanked
by
three
others
angel
rushes
to
head
them
off
but
has
to
step
back
from
wesley
who
nervously
holds
the
cross
in
his
face
one
of
his
cronies
blindsides
angel
with
a
right
hook
and
he
falls
to
the
floor
another
quickly
throws
a
net
over
him
and
the
third
starts
to
beat
him
with
a
crowbar
while
the
others
tie
angel
up
wesley
goes
over
to
faith
and
removes
the
shackles
from
her
wrists
while
she
rubs
them
and
watches
angel
get
whaled
on
wesley
pulls
out
a
set
of
heavy
cuffs
and
chains
and
before
she
knows
it
her
wrists
are
bound
once
again
faith
confused
what
by
the
order
of
the
watcher's
council
of
britain
wesley
lifts
her
up
i
am
exercising
my
authority
and
removing
you
to
england
wesley
guides
her
out
where
you
will
accept
the
judgment
of
the
disciplinary
committee
one
of
the
men
helps
hold
faith
and
they
all
leave
the
mansion
leaving
angel
behind
entangled
in
a
mass
of
net
and
rope
part
4

the
streets
of
sunnydale
a
stepvan
drives
down
a
boulevard
cut
inside
faith
is
chained
to
a
bench
on
one
side
wesley
and
one
of
his
men
sit
on
the
bench
opposite
her
i'm
sorry
for
the
extreme
measures
unfortunately
this
is
a
rather
extreme
circumstance
whatever
please
believe
nobody
is
rushing
to
judgment
the
first
priority
of
both
myself
and
the
council
is
to
help
you
faith
pulls
at
the
ring
holding
her
to
the
bench
ah
now
none
of
that
wesley
to
his
crony
tighten
her
restraints
faith
there's
no
point
in
fighting
this
faith
kicks
the
man
in
the
knee
and
he
falls
to
the
floor
she
presses
down
on
his
face
with
her
boot
have
to
disagree
with
you
on
that
one
now
unlock
these
or
i'll
pop
this
guy's
head
like
a
grape
wesley
hesitates
then
spies
a
wrench
on
the
floor
faith
sees
it
too
don't
even
think
about
it
she
holds
up
her
cuffed
wrists
for
him
to
unlock
he
gives
in
stands
up
pulls
the
keys
from
his
pocket
and
steps
over
to
set
her
free
faith
you
can't
keep
running
she
punches
him
hard
in
the
jaw
and
he
falls
onto
the
wrench
he
grabs
it
and
tries
to
swing
at
her
with
it
but
she
grabs
his
wrist
wrong
again
wes
she
grabs
his
jacket
with
her
other
hand
and
headbutts
him
hard
he
falls
down
unconscious
she
goes
to
the
doors
kicks
them
open
and
jumps
out
onto
the
street
she
rolls
a
few
times
before
coming
to
a
stop
and
watches
the
van
drive
away
she
looks
around
to
get
her
bearings
and
makes
her
getaway
cut
to
angel's
mansion
buffy
arrives
with
some
of
faith's
things
once
inside
she
notices
that
faith
is
gone
and
then
sees
angel
still
struggling
to
get
out
of
the
ropes
she
rushes
over
to
help
him
out
cut
to
the
library
giles
willow
and
xander
are
all
there
with
buffy
and
angel
it
was
the
new
watcher
he
had
a
couple
of
guys
helping
him
then
he
figured
it
out
which
means
that
faith
will
be
soon
on
her
way
back
to
england
to
face
the
watcher's
council
and
then
what
most
likely
they'll
lock
her
away
for
a
good
long
while
so
we
head
them
off
at
the
airport
and
stop
them
can
i
ii'm
just
wondering
why
willow
gets
a
look
from
buffy
i'm
not
the
most
objective
i
know
i
kind
of
have
an
issue
with
faith
sharing
my
people
willow
looks
at
xander
who
closes
his
eyes
but
she
murdered
someone
and
accused
buffy
then
she
hurt
xander
i
hate
to
say
it
but
maybe
she
belongs
behind
bars
giles
thinks
about
that
she's
out
of
control
i
know
but
angel
was
getting
somewhere
with
her
she
was
opening
up
if
we
could
just
stop
wesley
wesley
walks
into
the
library
that's
no
longer
an
issue
you
let
her
get
away
'let'
wouldn't
be
the
way
i'd
phrase
it
but
yes
she
escaped
giles
rolls
his
eyes
and
takes
off
his
glasses
that's
good
work
angel
walks
across
the
room
first
you
terrorize
her
then
you
put
her
back
in
the
streets
angel
sits
on
the
table
that
was
hardly
my
plan
i
was
trying
to
save
her
buffy
accusingly
but
you
didn't
you
probably
destroyed
her
giles
interrupts
quietly
buffy
that's
enough
giles
puts
his
glasses
back
on
i
better
find
her
before
she
does
any
more
damage
buffy
stands
up
we're
gonna
need
to
split
up
i'll
check
the
docks
that's
probably
where
she
is
giles
why
don't
you
go
to
her
motel
xander
willow
her
haunts
and
be
careful
they
all
get
up
to
leave
i'll
try
the
airport
angel
goes
everyone
walks
past
wesley
on
their
way
out
what
can
i
do
i
want
to
help
buffy
resentfully
you
still
got
your
ticket
back
to
the
mother
country
she
follows
the
others
out
leaving
him
standing
there
alone
cut
to
the
docks
the
camera
closes
in
on
an
old
rusty
cargo
ship
and
across
to
the
dock
buffy
walks
along
it
watching
for
faith
she
passes
underneath
the
gangplank
and
stops
when
she
hears
faith
behind
her
you
don't
give
up
do
you
she's
on
the
ship
at
the
top
of
the
gangplank
not
on
my
friends

and
me
are
such
solid
buds
right
faith
walks
down
the
gangplank
we
could
be

too
late
faith
disgusted
for
me
to
change
and
be
more
like

miss
goodytwoshoes

halfway

on
the
railing

grins
evilly

she
climbs
over
the
railing
and
hops
down
to
the
dock
yeah

scares
me
faith
you're
hurting
people
you're
hurting
yourself
faith
approaches
buffy
but
that's
not
it
that's
not
what
bothers
you
so
much
what
bugs
you
is
you
know
i'm
right

in
your
gut

the
law

she
turns
her
back
and
walks
away
faith
follows
right
behind
yes

know
exactly
what
i'm
about
'cause
you
have
it
in
you
too
no
faith
you're
sick
i've
seen
it
b
you've
got
the
lust
and
i'm
not
just
talking
about
screwing
vampires
buffy
stops
in
her
tracks
don't
you
dare
bring
him
into
this
faith
taunting
her
it
was
good
wasn't
it
the
sex
the
danger
bet
a
part
of
you
even
dug
him
when
he
went
psycho
no
buffy
continues
walking
faith
follows
see
you
need
me
to
toe
the
line
because
you're
afraid
you'll
go
over
it
aren't
you
b
you
can't
handle
watching
me
living
my
own
way
having
a
blast
because
it
tempts
you
you
know
it
could
be
you
buffy
has
had
enough
she
stops
faces
her
and
backhand
punches
her
in
the
jaw
faith
comes
up
smiling
wickedly
there's
my
girl
buffy
tries
to
get
away
no
i'm
not
gonna
do
this
faith
doesn't
let
her
go
why
not
it
feels
good
blood
rising
buffy
hears
a
noise
above
looks
up
and
notices
a
palette
of
crates
above
them
falling
directly
at
faith
she
shoves
her
out
of
the
way
but
gets
struck
herself
and
goes
down
she
is
dazed
but
not
out
faith
gets
up
and
goes
to
help
buffy
when
mr
trick
and
three
other
vampires
suddenly
attack
faith
spins
around
when
she
hears
them
roar
but
is
soundly
punched
in
the
face
by
trick
forcing
her
body
to
snap
to
the
side
he
and
another
one
grab
her
by
her
jacket
and
throw
her
to
the
ground
as
faith
tries
to
get
to
her
feet
the
second
vampire
roundhouse
kicks
her
in
the
face
she
blocks
it
and
drops
a
bit
but
manages
to
get
up
and
block
an
uppercut
from
the
third
one
by
grabbing
his
hand
she
backhand
punches
him
in
the
face
making
him
step
back
to
keep
his
balance
and
turns
to
face
the
second
vampire
she
high
blocks
a
wide
swing
from
him
and
punches
him
making
him
fall
but
the
third
one
behind
her
flat
hands
her
in
the
back
and
she
stumbles
buffy
starts
to
come
out
of
her
daze
buffy
whispers
oh
god
the
third
vampire
holds
faith
with
her
arms
behind
her
back
she
tries
to
get
free
by
snapping
her
heel
backwards
and
striking
his
kneecap
that
has
no
effect
so
she
snaps
her
head
back
and
butts
him
dead
in
the
nose
but
the
vamp
still
doesn't
let
go
of
her
the
second
vampire
launches
into
a
half
spinning
hook
kick
intended
for
faith
but
she
ducks
it
and
the
demon
holding
her
takes
the
blow
lets
go
of
her
and
goes
down
faith
flies
into
full
spinning
jumping
outtoin
crescent

hitting
the
second
vampire
hard
in
the
face
and
sending
him
spinning
to
the
ground
the
first
vampire
runs
at
her
but
she
sidesteps
him
and
shoves
him
into
the
third
who
was
just
getting
up
he
isn't
knocked
down
though
and
comes
at
her
she
grabs
him
and
pulls
him
with
her
toward
the
water
and
throws
him
off
the
dock
buffy
is
out
of
her
daze
now
and
with
difficulty
pulls
her
legs
out
from
under
the
pallet
of
crates
that
fell
on
her
she
gets
to
her
feet
but
is
immediately
punched
by
mr
trick
she
falls
spinning
onto
the
crates
and
rolls
off
onto
the
concrete
she
gets
to
her
feet
as
trick
approaches
and
tries
to
backhand
punch
him
but
he
middle
blocks
it
so
she
punches
him
in
the
gut
instead
her
jab
is
weak
though
and
has
no
effect
on
him
trick
does
a
painful
right
hook
to
her
face
buffy
stumbles
backward
trick
advances
and
swings
again
this
time
snapping
her
head
back
with
a
powerful
uppercut
making
her
fall
onto
another
pile
of
crates
faith
does
a
halfspinning
hook
kick
connecting
with
the
second
vampire's
jaw
he
falls
onto
an
open
barrel
and
struggles
not
to
fall
in
the
first
one
comes
at
her
again
but
she
has
her
stake
out
now
and
jams
it
home
he
explodes
into
ashes
she
looks
over
and
sees
buffy
struggling
with
mr
trick
he
wraps
a
cord
around
her
neck
and
begins
to
choke
her
but
faith
isn't
finished
with
her
fight
yet
the
second
vampire
throws
off
the
barrel
only
to
become
intimate
with
her
stake
and
burst
into
ashes
faith
sees
trick
yank
at
the
cord
around
buffy's
neck
and
pull
her
off
of
the
crates
he
pulls
her
up
and
swings
her
around
into
a
pallet
leaning
against
still
more
crates
she
hits
it
hard
and
falls
to
the
pavement
faith
looks
around
trying
to
decide
what
to
do
she
sees
trick
pick
buffy
up
again
and
slam
her
against
the
huge
crates
buffy
struggles
to
get
loose
but
the
cord
around
her
neck
is
too
tight
i
hear
once
you've
tasted
a
slayer
you
never
wanna
go
back
he
opens
his
fangfilled
mouth
wide
and
moves
in
for
the
bite
buffy
struggles
to
keep
him
away
but
can't
suddenly
mr
trick
stops
and
looks
up
in
wideeyed
shock
oh
no
trick
shakes
his
head
no
this
is
no
good
at
all
he
begins
to
fall
and
explodes
into
ashes
as
faith
pulls
her
stake
back
the
two
slayers
look
at
each
other
uncertainly
for
a
long
while
faith
lowers
her
stake
buffy
massages
her
neck
cut
to
the
library
buffy
sits
at
the
table
while
giles
pours
her
some
coffee
from
his
thermos
so
she
saved
you
giles
walks
slowly
around
the
table
she
could
have
left
me
there
to
die
giles
but
she
didn't
she
opted
to
come
back
to
town
with
you
that
that
bodes
well
giles
sits
she
still
has
a
lot
to
face
before
she
can
put
this
behind
her
i'm
not
gonna
give
up
on
her
giles
pours
himself
a
cup
then
i
think
she
stands
a
chance
cut
to
the
mayor's
office
he
pulls
on
his
overcoat
getting
ready
to
leave
for
the
night
he
looks
down
at
his
desk
and
adjusts
the
angle
of
the
penholder
gives
a
satisfied
nod
picks
up
his
briefcase
and
heads
for
the
door
when
he
opens
it
he
is
surprised
to
see
faith
standing
there
arms
crossed
faith
accusingly
you
sent
your
boy
to
kill
me
mayor
wilkins
unfazed
that's
right
i
did
he's
dust
i
thought
he
might
be
what
with
you
standing
here
and
all
faith
steps
brazenly
into
the
doorway
i
guess
that
means
you
have
a
job
opening
the
mayor
steps
back
to
let
her
enter
and
closes
the
door
