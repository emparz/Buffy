sunnydale
mall
the
low
camera
angle
shows
the
legs
of
the
people
walking
past
the
shops
on
the
ground
floor
the
camera
pans
up
past
a
cowboy
and
his
girlfriend
to
the
second
floor
and
over
the
railing
where
buffy
and
her
mother
are
walking
along
joyce

a
shopping
bag
in
each
hand
and
buffy
has
on
a
small
backpack
come

you
understand
how
important
this
is
it's
an
outfit
an
outfit
that
you
may
never
buy
but
i
looked
good
in
it
you
looked
like
a
streetwalker
but
a
thin
streetwalker
buffy
gets
a
look
from
her
mom
that's
probably
not
gonna
be
the
winning
argument
is
it
you're
just
too
young
to
wear
that
yeah
and
i'm
gonna
be
too
young
to
wear
it
until
i'm
too
old
to
wear
it

the
idea
joyce

and
looks
around
the
stores

i
still
need

order
the
flyers
for
the
opening

joyce
walks
off
buffy
reluctantly
starts
for
the
tailors
cut
to
the
escalators
buffy
gets
on
to
go
to
the
ground
floor
she
looks
around
idly
as
she
descends
she
sees
the
cowboy
and
his
girlfriend
come
up
the
other
escalator
she
keeps
looking
around
and
then
notices
that
the
cowboy's
reflection
is
missing
from
the
mirrors
that
line
the
escalator
corridor
she
looks
back
at
the
couple
and
he
is
indeed
there
immediately
she
turns
and
runs
back
up
the
escalator
weaving
between
the
people
coming
down
on
it
behind
her
cut
to
the
walkway
the
cowboy
and
the
girl
go
around
a
corner
buffy
walks
quickly
to
catch
up
cut
to
a
back
hallway
buffy
slowly
walks
past
a
bank
of
payphones
by
the
restrooms
and
looks
around
for
them
apparently
having
lost
them
she
continues
down
the
hall
and
hears
a
pinball
machine
reaching
the
rear
door
of
the
arcade
she
sees
that
the
metal
gate
has
been
bent
and
forced
open
she
quietly
squeezes
by
the
gate
and
goes
in
the
place
is
deserted
and
quiet
except
for
the
sound
of
the
one
machine
she
walks
around
one
side
of
a
bank
of
game
machines
while
the
camera
pans
along
the
other
turn
around

at
him
and

runs
from

at

but
she
blocks
it
and
punches
him
in
the
face
and
the
crotch
he
grabs
his
groin
and
buffy
shoves
him
into
another
pinball
machine
he
looks
up
at
her
and
gives
her
an
evil
smile

the
utility
closet
at

serious

that
cordelia

worried

gonna
miss
class
cordelia
continues
kissing
he
reaches
up
for
the
light
string
and
yanks
it
to
turn
it
on
they
step
back
a
bit
from
each
other
you
know
what
this
would
work
a
lot
better
for
me
if
you
didn't
talk
well
it'd
work
a
lot
better
for
me
with
the
lights
off
she
grabs
the
string
and
yanks
it
she
puts
her
arms
around
him
again
and
starts
to
kiss
him
but
xander
doesn't
kiss
back
he
yanks
the
string
again
and
the
light
comes
back
on
they
step
away
from
each
other
again
are
you
saying
that
you
can't
look
at
me
when
we
do
whatever
it
is
we
do
no
it's
not
that
i
can't
it's
just
more
i
don't
want
to
that's
great
that's
just
dandy
we're
repulsed
by
each
other
we
xander
indicates
the
door
we
hide
from
our
friends
well
i
should
hope
so
please
xander
nods
all
in
all
this
is
not
what
i'd
call
a
big
selfesteem
booster
tell
me
about
it
cordelia
looks
him
over
just
look
at
you
and
those
clothes
where
did
you
get
those
shoes
okay
you
know
what
i
don't
need
this
ditto
like
a
hole
in
the
head
they
both
reach
for
the
doorknob
and
their
hands
meet
there
they
hesitate
a
moment
and
then
wrap
their
arms
around
each
other
again
and
kiss
even
more
passionately
xander
cradles
her
head
in
his
hand
as
they
slowly
sink
to
the
floor
he
reaches
up
for
the
string
and
gives
it
a
good
yank
cut
to
teen
health
class
the
instructor
is
writing
'sex'
on
the
board
sex
sex
mr
whitmore
faces
the
class
the
sex
drive
in
the
human
animal
is
intense
how
many
of
us
have
lost
countless
productive
hours
plagued
by
unwanted
sexual
thoughts
and
feelings
yes
xander
raises
his
hand
and
nods
mmhm
willow
gives
him
a
concerned
look
that
was
a
rhetorical
question
mr
harris
not
a
poll
several
students
giggle
xander
lowers
his
hand
oh
cordelia
looks
away
from
him
and
stares
down
at
her
book
of
course
for
teenagers
such
as
yourselves
these
feelings
are
even
more
overwhelming
with
all
sorts
of
hormones
surging
willow
is
clearly
nervous
and
looks
back
and
forth
between
xander
and
giving
her
attention
to
the
teacher
through
your
bodies
compelling
you
to
action
it's
often
difficult
to
remember
that
there
are
negative
consequences
to
uh
having
sex
would
anyone
care
to
offer
one
such
consequence
cordelia
raises
her
hand
and
mr
whitmore
indicates
to
her
giving
her
the
floor
well
that
depends
are
you
talking
about
sex
in
the
car
or
out
of
the
car
mr
whitmore
looks
confused
because
i
have
a
friend
not
me
that
was
in
a
miata
at
parked
at
the
top
of
the
hill
and
then
she
kicked
the
gearshift
and
and
mr
whitmore
interrupts
yeah
i
i
was
thinking
of
something
a
little
more
commonplace
ms
chase
xander
raises
his
hand
and
mr
whitmore
indicates
to
him
willow
stares
at
him
you
wanna
talk
negative
consequence
what
about
the
heartbreak
of
halitosis
cordelia
looks
at
him
and
he
looks
back
i
mean
a
girl
may
seem
spiffy
but
if
she
ignores
her
flossing
the
bloom
is
definitely
off
the
rose
cordelia
immediately
raises
her
hand
again
mr
whitmore
exhales
and
gives
her
permission
to
speak
again
like
that
compares
to
kissing
a
guy
who
thinks
the
hoover
technique
is
a
big
turnon
willow
looks
back
and
forth
between
the
two
of
them
very
confused
the
exchange
begins
to
draw
muffled
comments
from
among
the
other
students
what
about
having
to
feign
interest
in
her
vapid
little
chit
chat
just
so
you
can
get
some
touch
cordelia
is
incensed
now
another
consequence
of
sexual
activity
anyone
cordelia
raises
her
hand
again
uh
else
willow
raises
her
hand
he
indicates
that
she
should
speak
how
about
pregnancy
that
would
be
a
major
one
right
thank
you
ms
rosenberg
willow
smiles
smugly
among
teens
unwanted
pregnancy
is
the
number
one
negative
consequence
of
sexual
activity
so
as
discussed
last
week
i
present
you
with
mr
whitmore
takes
a
sheet
off
of
two
trays
of
eggs
your
offspring
mr
whitmore
willow
smiles
you
will
split
into
parenting
teams
you
and
your
partner
will
share
equally
in
the
daily
task
of
raising
mr
whitmore
indicates
the
trays
your
egg
mr
whitmore
takes
a
tray
to
distribute
now
please
choose
a
partner
and
come
pick
up
your
children
willow
waves
at
xander
but
he
ignores
her
and
gets
up
to
go
over
to
cordelia
she
sees
him
coming
and
immediately
grabs
the
shirtsleeve
of
the
boy
sitting
across
from
her
to
get
his
attention
you
wanna
have
a
baby
xander
is
disappointed
he
sees
another
girl
walk
up
to
the
second
tray
of
eggs
still
on
the
teacher's
desk
and
approaches
her
hey
xander
chuckles
i
know
we
just
met
but
isn't
that
xander
jr
you're
holding
the
girl
giggles
and
smiles
and
turns
around
to
walk
away
xander
gives
cordelia
another
glance
then
follows
the
other
girl
cut
to
the
library
buffy
walks
over
to
the
card
catalog
pulls
out
a
drawer
and
begins
going
through
the
cards
giles
is
in
the
cage
behind
her
xander
opens
the
door
for
willow
and
they
come
on
buffy
how
come
you
weren't
in
class
vampire
issues
did
mr
whitmore
notice
i
was
tardy
i
think
the
word
you're
searching
for
is
'absent'
tardy
people
show
right
and
yes
he
did
notice
so
he
wanted
me
to
give
you
this
willow
hands
her
an
egg
buffy
rolls
the
egg
around
in
her
hands
as
far
as
punishments
go
this
is
fairly
abstract
no
it's
your
baby
willow
smiles
buffy
confused
okay
i
get
it
even
less
well
you
know
it's
the
whole
'sex
leads
to
responsibility'
thing
which
i
personally
don't
get
you
gotta
take
care
of
the
egg
it's
a
baby
you
gotta
keep
it
safe
and
teach
it
christian
values
willow
looks
at
xander
my
egg
is
jewish
then
teach
it
that
dreidel
song
willow
smiles
at
that
i
can't
do
this
i
can't
take
care
of
things
i
killed
my
giga
pet
literally
i
sat
on
it
and
it
broke
she
sets
the
egg
down
on
top
of
the
catalog
moans
and
quickly
walks
over
to
a
book
reshelving
cart
you'll
do
fine
yeah
the
only
thing
that
stresses
me
is
when
do
we
tell
them
that
they're
adopted
i'll
just
lay
that
one
off
on
my
partner
buffy
looks
up
worried
who'd
i
get
well
there
were
an
uneven
number
of
students
and
you
didn't
show
so
buffy
in
shocked
disbelief
i'm
a
single
mother
xander
nods
no
man
of
her
own
do
you
know
what
this
says
about
me
that
i
am
doomed
to
lead
my
mother's
life
buffy
paces
back
to
them
how
deeply
scary
is
that
how
'bout
this
it
says
nothing
it
means
nothing
this
whole
egg
experiment
thing
is
completely
pointless
giles
in
the
cage
success
giles
comes
out
with
a
book
at
last
your
playmate
is
a
fellow
of
repute
it
seems
he
moves
to
set
the
book
on
top
of
buffy's
egg
she
inhales
in
fright
and
quickly
snatches
it
away
willow
and
xander
look
on
in
wideeyed
surprise
giles
points
out
a
picture
in
the
book
that's
um
lyle
gorch
and
that
one's
his
brother
tector
they're
from
abilene
they
uh
they
made
their
reputation
by
massacring
an
entire
mexican
village
in
1886
takes
off
his
glasses
to
clean
them
friendly
little
demons
that
was
before
they
became
vampires
she
raises
her
eyebrows
at
giles
willow
and
xander
exchange
a
look
bbut
um
the
good
news
is
that
they're
not
amongst
the
great
thinkers
of
our
times
i
doubt
if
they're
up
to
much
they're
probably
just
drawn
here
by
the
uh
hellmouth's
energy
giles
puts
his
glasses
back
on
'nuff
said
i
propose
buffy
slays
'em
all
in
favor
xander
raises
his
hand
willow
raises
her
hand
aye
ii
don't
think
you
should
underestimate
them
i
mean
yyou
may
need
to
have
some
help
if
if
if
if
giles
notices
the
eggs
why
do
you
all
have
eggs
willow
smiles
hey
maybe
you
can
have
angel
help
you
find
the
gorches
giles
still
confused
yes
yes
yes
that's
not
a
bad
idea
strength
in
numbers
oh

see
a
lotta
hunting
getting
done
in
that
scenario

to
the
park
angel
and
buffy

locked
in
a
passionate
kiss
buffy
breaks
off
i
really
i
know
they
continue
kissing
after
a
few
seconds
buffy
breaks
off
again
you
know
this
isn't
hunting
in
the
classical
sense
we
should
you're
right
they
kiss
some
more
a
few
moments
later
they
break
off
again
okay

buffy
kiss
okay
they
walk
side
by
side
for
a
few
paces
you
see
anything
no
okay
buffy
faces
him
enough
hunting
they
begin
their
passionate
kissing
with
renewed
vigor
the
camera
pans
away
from
them
over
to
a
wall
among
the
trees
the
gorch
brothers
are
crouched
on
top
watching
them
that
the
slayer

she
sets
the
notepad
down
and
crawls
under
the
covers
she
yawns
and
looks
at
her
egg
in
its
basket
on
her
nightstand
good
night
eggbert
she
taps
her
egg
gently
and
then
reaches
up
to
turn
off
the
light
she
pulls
up
the
covers
and
settles
in
to
sleep
cut
outside
the
house
later
that
night
cut
to
buffy's
room
the
camera
pans
across
her
stuffed
animals
arranged
on
one
side
of
her
bed
past
her
and
over
to
the
egg
the
clock
reads
2
03am
the
egg
is
rocking
back
and
forth
the
camera
closes
in
on
it
a
small
hole
has
almost
been
chipped
out
the
plug
breaks
open
and
a
long
thin
tentacle
begins
to
make
its
way
out
it
angles
over
towards
buffy
and
branches
out
into
several
fingers
as
it
makes
its
way
over
to
her
part
2

buffy's
room
at
night
the
tentacle
continues
over
to
buffy
one
of
its
fingers
goes
into
her
ear
another
one
lays
itself
across
her
left
eye
a
third
one
covers
her
right
eye
another
goes
around
her
neck
and
presumably
into
her
other
ear
cut
to
a
view
of
her
with
the
egg
in
the
foreground
the
tentacles
are
now
just
lying
on
her
face
the
focus
of
the
camera
goes
off
of
buffy
and
onto
the
egg
in
its
basket
cut
to
the
sewers
the
next

smugly
wait
till

buffy
lets
out
an
exasperated
breath
picks
up
her
egg
and
leaves
cut
to
the
library
giles
is
returning
some
books
to
the
shelves
he
walks
out
from
behind
the
stacks
to
see
xander
willow
and
buffy
looking
up
at
him
from
the
bottom
of
the
steps
oh
why
are
you
three
hanging
about
don't
you
have
classes
to
go
to
teen
health
got
canceled
mr
whitmore's
out
couldn't
find
an
egg
sitter
or
something
buffy
and
willow
walk
up
a
few
steps
well
then
can
you
give
me
a
hand
no
they
sit
down
on
the
steps
xander
hops
up
the
steps
to
the
mezzanine
level
sure
xander
starts
to
shelve
some
books
how
did
the
um
hunt
go
last
night
buffy
no
go
uh
'no'
'no'
you
didn't
go
or
or
or
you
were
unsuccessful
no
gorches
apparently
buffy
has
decided
the
problem
with
the
english
language
is
all
those
pesky
words
xander
looks
at
her
you
angel
big
smoochies
shut
up
iit's
true
buffy
you
and
willow
do
seem
a
little
sluggish
are
you
quite
sure
everything's
alright
buffy
and
willow
exchange
a
look
maybe
something
we
ate
or
perhaps
it's
the
burden
of
parenthood
notice
how
seriously
you
two
have
taken
this
egg
thing
xander
the
girls
clutch
their
egg
baskets
while
i
in
turn
have
uh
well
chosen
a
takes
his
egg
out
of
his
shirt
pocket
more
balanced
approach
starts
tossing
it
around
willow
concerned
xander
maybe
you
shouldn't
xander
interrupts
that's
exactly
what
i'm
talking
about
xander
tosses
you
can't
stress
over
every
little
thing
xander
tosses
a
child
picks
up
on
that
which
is
a
oneway
ticket
xander
tosses
to
neurotic
city
he
catches
and
tosses
the
egg
again
but
misses
the
next
catch
the
girls
gasp
in
fright
as
the
egg
hits
the
floor
giles
lets
out
a
yelp
too
but
then
stares
at
the
egg
curiously
it
just
wobbles
to
a
stop
unbroken
willow
surprised
it
didn't
break
willow
suspicious
how
come
it
didn't
break
xander
realizes
he's
been
found
out
which
is
another
secret
to
conscientious
egg
care
pot
of
scalding
water
and
about
eight
minutes
you
boiled
your
young
yeah
i
know
it
sounds
cruel
but
sometimes
you
gotta
be
cruel
to
be
kind
i
mean
you
can
bet
that
little
xander
here
is
thickskinned
now
xander
reaches
down
for
the
egg
and
picks
it
up
technically
that
would
be
cheating
yes
he
reaches
up
to
put
a
book
on
a
high
shelf
at
the
back
of
the
shelf
there's
an
egg
no
it's
like
a
short
cut
you
know
when
you
run
a
race
that
would
also
be
cheating
willow
shakes
her
head
you
should
be
ashamed
i
suppose
there
is
a
sort
of
machiavellian
ingenuity
to
your
transgression
i
resent
that
xander
gets
a
look
from
giles
or
possibly
thank
you
cordelia
comes
walking
into
the
library
figures
you
three
would
all
be
hanging
in
the
dungeon
while
something
major's
going
on
at
sunnydale
high
and
what
would
that
be
cordelia
barrette
appreciation
day
xander
goes
back
to
his
shelving
mr
whitmore
didn't
show
today
that
news
is
of
the
past
he's
missing
cordelia
the
girls
all
look
at
giles
presumed
dead
presumed
by
whom
well
me
cordelia
crosses
her
arms
i
think
we
should
give
him
a
few
hours
before
we
give
up
on
him
completely
well
i
think
we
should
look
around
don't
you
xander
xander
looks
at
her
and
shakes
his
head
it
can
wait
well
his
body
could
fall
out
of
a
closet
somewhere
xander
looks
at
the
others
nervously
so
we
should
check
some
closets
to
see
if
he's
in
a
closet
xander
points
at
her
you're
right
there
could
be
a
closet
let's
go
he
points
at
buffy
and
willow
as
he
comes
down
the
stairs
you
guys
look
for
more
clues
we'll
meet
back
here
he
takes
cordelia
by
the
arm
and
guides
her
out
of
the
library
buffy
unenthusiastically
we'll
get
right
on
it
willow
staring
after
them
are
they
getting
weirder
have
you
noticed
the
weirdness
of
them
willow
looks
at
buffy
they're
weird
buffy
to
giles
should
i
have
guilt
about
not
looking
for
mr
whitmore
ii'd
rather
you
conserve
your
strength
for
hunting
the
gorches
i'll
be
fine
by
tonight
maybe
i'll
sweep
the
cemetery
giles
concerned
well
be
careful
iiif
you're
still
feeling
a
little
sluggish
no
worries
and
angel's
helping
you
right
he
does
what
he
can
cut
to
the
cemetery
that
night
buffy
and
angel
are
engaged
in
a
passionate
kissing
session
once
again
ahh
buffy
kisses
buffy
breaks
off
as
much
as
i
hate
to
say
this
we
should
really
go
kill
bad
guys
buffy
kiss
it's
late
you
should
really
get
home
hmm
angel
kiss
what
about
the
gorches
buffy
kiss
i'll
hunt
angel
kiss
really
buffy
pulls
back
and
smiles
you'd
do
that
not
like
i
have
an
early
day
tomorrow
mm
buffy
kiss
true
buffy
they
walk
i
still
have
to
go
home
and
fill
out
my
egg
diary
your
what
oh
i
told
you
that
faux
parenting
gig
we're
doing
at
school
buffy
faces
him
like
i'm
really
planning
to
have
kids
anytime
soon
uh
maybe
someday
in
the
future
when
i'm
done
having
a
life
but
right
now
kids
would
be
just
a
little
too
much
to
deal
with
i
wouldn't
know
angel
looks
at
her
i
don't
well
you
know
i
i
can't
oh
buffy
looks
away
briefly
then
back
that's
okay
um
ii
figured
there
were
all
sorts
of
things
vampires
couldn't
do
you
know
like
work
for
the
telephone
company
or
volunteer
for
the
red
cross
or
have
little
vampires
so
you
don't
think
about
the
future
no
never
no
angel
swallows
you
really
don't
care
what
happens
a
year
from
now
five
years
from
now
angel
when
i
look
into
the
future
aa
all
i
see
is
you
all
i
want
is
you
i
know
the
feeling
he
reaches
down
to
kiss
her
he
finds
her
lips
and
she
responds
they
kiss
more
and
more
passionately
the
camera
pans
away
from
them
and
across
a
gravestone
that
reads
'in
loving
memory'
cut
to
the
halls
at
school
that
night
the
night
watchman
comes
walking
along
and
checks
a
door
finding
it
properly
locked
he
continues
on
he
stops
at
the
hall
intersection
and
looks
each
way
to
his
right
he
sees
the
door
to
the
basement
standing
ajar
and
goes
over
to
it
he
opens
it
wider
looks
in
and
enters
cut
into
the
basement
the
watchman
comes
down
the
steps
making
no
attempt
to
be
quiet
the
doors
to
the
boiler
room
are
open
and
he
steps
in
he
tries
the
light
switch
but
it
doesn't
work
hello
is
anybody
in
here
he
pulls
out
his
maglite
turns
it
on
and
continues
into
the
room
the
lights
on
the
boiler
controls
are
active
and
the
fires
are
burning
when
he's
walked
past
the
boilers
he
sees
a
huge
hole
in
the
concrete
wall
behind
a
bunch
of
stacked
up
barrels
and
boxes
he
slowly
walks
over
to
the
stack
with
his
flashlight
held
over
his
shoulder
like
a
bat
lighting
the
way
but
ready
to
swing
if
need
be
finding
no
one
there
he
puts
his
maglite
down
and
pushes
aside
a
stack
of
boxes
blocking
the
way
he
can
see
the
hole
clearly
now
and
a
tunnel
continues
on
beyond
it
he
picks
up
his
flashlight
again
and
holds
it
ready
like
before
he
steps
up
to
look
through
the
hole
behind
him
mr
whitmore
appears
holding
a
pick
and
slams
him
across
the
back
with
it
making
him
fall
through
the
hole
and
knocking
him
out
mr
whitmore
climbs
through
the
hole
after
the
watchman
cut
to
buffy's
room
she
climbs
in
through
the
window
and
her
egg
rocking
in
its
basket
immediately
grabs
her
attention
she
stares
at
it
a
second
and
then
comes
over
to
it
she
bends
down
to
look
at
it
closely
not
having
expected
it
to
hatch
and
curious
about
it
she
gets
closer
and
closer
staring
at
it
intently
the
top
half
of
the
shell
cracks
into
thirds
suddenly
two
of
the
pieces
fly
away
while
the
third
just
falls
back
and
she
sees
a
purplishgray
thing
with
tentacles
is
curled
up
inside
of
it
it
jumps
out
at
her
and
she
reacts
instantly
it
misses
her
lands
on
the
floor
and
quickly
crawls
under
her
bed
buffy
is
stunned
but
quickly
regains
her
composure
and
reaches
down
into
her
wicker
laundry
basket
for
her
iron
she
stands
back
up
and
looks
at
the
darkness
under
her
bedspread
slowly
she
approaches
her
bed
and
kneels
down
she
quickly
raises
the
spread
and
looks
underneath
with
the
iron
held
ready
to
smash
anything
that
might
come
at
her
nothing
she
stands
back
up
and
scans
around
her
room
whatever
it
was
it's
nowhere
to
be
seen
suddenly
it
falls
onto
her
shoulder
from
above
it
tries
to
crawl
down
her
back
but
she
grabs
it
and
flings
it
off
it
crawls
quickly
behind
her
desk
and
along
the
wall
past
her
bookcase
toward
her
bed
she
looks
for
a
different
weapon
and
grabs
a
pair
of
scissors
from
her
desk
the
creature
in
the
meantime
has
disappeared
again
she
approaches
her
bed
with
the
scissors
held
ready
to
stab
behind
her
the
hatchling
crawls
up
the
wall
buffy
senses
it
and
swings
around
with
the
scissors
and
stabs
it
dead
center
she
pulls

an
egg
buffy
it
doesn't
emote
cordelia
sees

that
your
real
hair
buffy
watches

go
willow
puts
her
hand
on
buffy's
shoulder
and
she
turns
to
face
her
hey
hi
cut
to
xander
munching
on
a
candy
bar
he
looks
down
at
it
as
he
chews
hard
mm
cardboardy
he
sits
on
a
wall
and
discards
the
rest
of
the
candy
bar
he
opens
his
satchel
and
digs
through
it
for
his
egg
he
pulls
it
out
looks
at
it
and
lets
out
a
breath
sorry
junior
but
a
man's
gotta
eat
he
taps
the
egg
a
few
times
on
the
wall
next
to
him
and
then
rolls
it
back
and
forth
under
his
hand
cut
to
buffy
and
willow
walking
across
the
grass
toward
xander
behind
them
cordelia
catches
up
as
she
looks
through
a
book
so
was
there
any
more
hatchling
activity
last
night
no
uh
you
were
probably
right
it
was
just
a
trap
from
them
set
for
me
and
buffy
sees
cordelia
mm
buffy
indicates
her
everyone
else's
egg
seemed
perfectly
normal
did
you
bring
the
thing
that
attacked
you
yeah
giles
wants
to
see
it
he's
in
full
research
mode
okay
well
bring
it
to
the
science
lab
and
i'll
get
giles
and
we'll
analyze
it
the
camera
pans
around
them
and
focuses
on
willow's
lower
back
great
you
know
i
always
say
that
a
day
without
an
autopsy
is
like
a
day
without
sunshine
the
camera
shows
a
hatchling
attached
to
willow's
back
under
her
shirt
cut
to
xander
he
smiles
and
nods
at
the
girls
when
he
sees
them
coming
hey
he
holds
up
the
egg
ready
to
take
a
bite
there's
a
purplishgray
creature
still
inside
dead
from
being
boiled
xander
looks
at
it
just
as
he's
about
to
bite
into
it
and
freaks
out
he
screams
as
he
tosses
the
egg
away
from
him
cut
to
the
science
lab
the
hatchling
is
laid
out
in
a
dissection
tray
xander
taps
his
fingers
on
the
table
as
he
and
buffy
look
at
it
can
i
just
say
gyughhh
i
see
your
'gyughhh'
and
raise
you
a
nyaghhh
what
is
it
we
don't
know
what
it
is
cordelia
that's
why
we're
here
capisce
'capisce'
what
are
you
world
traveler
now
willow
comes
into
the
lab
hey
where's
giles
i
know
he
won't
wanna
miss
this
he
said
to
get
started
he'll
be
by
as
soon
as
possible
so
okay
get
started
buffy
dissect
it
or
something
xander
hands
her
a
scalpel
buffy
takes
the
blade
me
why
do
i
have
to
dissect
it
uh
because
you're
the
slayer
and
i
slayed
my
work
here
is
done
buffy
puts
the
scalpel
on
the
table
in
front
of
xander
oh
no
i
almost
ate
one
of
those
things
i
think
i've
fulfilled
my
grossout
quota
for
the
decade
guys
she
takes
the
scalpel
and
starts
the
dissection
the
camera
pans
around
cordelia
to
her
bear
do
we
even
know
what
to
look
for
i
mean
how
are
we
supposed
to
figure
out
what
this
thing
is
the
bear's
right
eye
pops
out
and
a
tentacle
emerges
turn
it
over
maybe
we
missed
its
id
bracelet
the
bear's
left
eye
pops
out
and
another
tentacle
emerges
so
now
i
guess
uh
we
know
what
happened
to
mr
whitmore
cut
to
them
talking
he
saw
this
and
ran
away
try
best
case
scenario
it's
possible
that
mr
whitmore
wasn't
harmed
maybe
the
offspring
simply
used
him
to
return
to
the
mother
bezoar
cordelia
leans
over
to
pick
something
up
yeah
maybe
he
xander
turns
to
willow
what
cordelia
straightens
back
up
holding
a
metal
bar
which
she
wields
like
a
baseball
bat
what's
a
bez
cordelia
hits
buffy
in
the
face
with
the
bar
knocking
her
down
and
out
cordy
what
willow
picks
up
a
microscope
and
hits
xander
