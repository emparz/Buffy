open
on
exterior
shot
of
the
summers
house
day
cut
to
the
living
room
xander
walks
in
from
the
kitchen
carrying
a
bowl
of
popcorn
now
i
get
warren
being
the
supervillainy
type
but
i
thought
jonathan
completely
learned
that
lesson
i
never
even
heard
of
this
other
guy
xander
sits
on
the
sofa
beside
anya
puts
the
popcorn
on
the
coffee
table
willow
is
sitting
in
a
chair
opposite
the
sofa
you
should
have
seen
their
headquarters
it
was
like
the
nerd
natural
habitat
well
if
we
know
where
they
are
shouldn't
we
do
something
we
tried
buffy
was
gonna
go
in
there
and
bust
them
on
the
spot
i'm
sensing
a
'not
so
completely'
willow
yeah
well
she
went
in
and
then
anya
speaking
of
buffy
isn't
she
ready
she's
gonna
be
late
for
her
first
day
hey
respect
the
narrative
flow
much
please
continue
the
story
of
failure
so
buffy
went
in
but
they'd
cleared
out
and
she
brought
back
the
stuff
that
they
left
willow
xander
listening
eating
popcorn
spell
books
some
parchments
willow
smiling
a
couple
of
rare
things
charmed
objects
and
a
conjurer's
harp
willow
trails
off
looking
a
little
wistful
xander
and
anya
look
at
her
with
concern
willow
snaps
out
of
it
aand
they
had
other
stuff
you
know
razor
scooters
and
pictures
of
the
vulcan
woman
on
enterprise
xander
ooh
willow
chuckles
rubs
his
hands
together
then
sees
anya's
expression
i
mean
nerds
okay
see
this
is
why
demons
are
better
than
people
interesting
turn
when
i
was
a
vengeance
demon
i
caused
pain
and
mayhem
certainly
but
i
put
in
a
full
day's
work
doing
it
and
i
got
compensated
appropriately
welcome
to
today's
episode
of
'go
money
go'
i
hear
it
daily
yep
for
the
rest
of
your
life
xander
looks
dismayed
continues
to
contemplate
that
as
anya
continues
talking
but
supervillains
want
reward
without
labor
to
make
things
come
easy
anya
lecturing
it's
wrong
without
labor
there
can
be
no
payment
and
vice
versa
anya
shot
of
willow
listening
intently
the
country
cannot
progress
the
workers
are
the
tools
that
shape
america
buffy
os
good
to
know
the
others
look
over
reveal
buffy
standing
in
the
doorway
wearing
red
pants
a
redandwhite
striped
shirt
and
a
hat
with
a
stuffed
animal
head
on
top
i
was
kinda
feelin'
like
a
tool
the
others
stare
and
now
i
know
why
wolf
howl
opening
credits
act
i

open
on
a
1950sstyle
commercial
sepiatoned
picture
of
the
exterior
of
a
fastfood
restaurant
with
cars
driving
past
you've
seen
us
in
your
city
or
small
town
across
the
american
west
picture
of
the
interior
of
the
restaurant
with
booths
and
hanging
plants
you've
ordered
our
delicious
food
sepia
picture
of
a
smiling
man
in
a
white
shirt
and
black
bowtie
giving
a
thumbsup
from
our
happy
employees
reveal
buffy
sitting
in
a
small
room
watching
this
on
a
television
she
wears
a
small
blue
pin
reading
buffy
summers
trainee
but
now
you're
seeing
it
all
from
a
different
way
you're
seeing
it
from
behind
the
counter
picture
of
a
smiling
woman
ordering
food
from
a
smiling
employee
this
picture
starts
off
sepiatoned
and
then
fades
to
natural
color
because
you've
just
become
part
of
the
doublemeat
experience
shot
of
a
geeky
teenage
boy
in
the
redandwhite
striped
uniform
holding
a
tray
covered
with
paperwrapped
burgers
i'm
part
of
it
shot
of
a
young
woman
wearing
the
uniform
holding
a
tray
i'm
part
of
it
shot
of
an
older
man
wearing
the
uniform
i'm
a
part
of
it
too
starcut
to
a
shot
of
a
farm
a
picture
of
a
cow
appears
in
front
of
it
this
cow
narrator
cow
moos
and
this
chicken
narrator
chicken
appears
beside
the
cow
and
squawks
don't
know
it
yet
but
they're
destined
to
become
part
of
it
as
well
so
what
happens
when
a
cow
and
a
chicken
come
together
the
pictures
of
the
cow
and
the
chicken
swirl
together
and
become
a
sandwich
why
that's
a
doublemeat
medley
let's
take
a
look
now
at
the
process
of
harvesting
these
two
special
meats
close
shot
of
a
row
of
cows'
rear
ends
cut
to
shot
of
buffy
watching
sounds
of
frantic
mooing
and
squawking
as
well
as
thumping
noises
buffy
makes
a
disgusted
face
holy
crap
fade
to
later
the
video
is
still
going
now
it
shows
a
man
in
the
uniform
washing
his
hands
washing
your
hands
thoroughly
after
each
visit
to
the
restroom
the
man
takes
a
paper
towel
to
dry
his
hands
zoom
in
on
the
papertowel
dispenser
bearing
the
words
notice
employees
must
wash
hands
with
soap
before
returning
to
work
follow
these
rules
and
you'll
be
a
happy
part
of
the
doublemeat
family
for
a
long
time
the
picture
changes
to
the
doublemeat
palace
logo
which
is
a
creature
that
looks
like
a
cross
between
a
cow
and
a
chicken
buffy
stares
at
the
screen
looking
dismayed
behind
her
a
man
in
the
redstriped
uniform
goes
over
to
the
wall
and
turns
on
the
light
he
turns
to
buffy
he
wears
thick
glasses
with
ugly
black
frames
he
is
manny
the
manager
and
this
is
his
office
interesting
isn't
it
buffy
fake
smile
oh
yes
like
how
the
cow
and
the
chicken
come
together
even
though
they've
never
met
it's
like
sleepless
in
seattle
if
buffy
manny
turning
off
the
tv
if
meg
and
tom
were
like
minced
buffy
smiles
at
manny
he
is
completely
humorless
i'm
manny
the
manager
it's
not
a
joke
it's
just
my
name
right
yyou
mentioned
that
a
couple
of
times
when
i
filled
out
the
application
why
do
you
want
to
work
here
buffy
you
seem
like
a
sharp
young
woman
and
there
are
a
lot
of
other
jobs
well
ii
kinda
need
money
pretty
quickly
like
today
and
and
so
i
didn't
want
to
go
through
a
lengthy
interview
process
and
i
figured
this
was
probably
the
fastest
way
to
she
pauses
as
she
catches
sight
of
manny's
stern
face
because
i
wanted
to
be
part
of
the
doublemeat
experience
manny
smiles
and
nods
come
on
let's
take
a
tour
cut
to
the
adjoining
employee
lounge
manny
leads
buffy
over
to
a
table
where
two
men
sit
staring
at
nothing

manny
starts
to
walk
away
as
buffy
follows

at
philip

timothy
who
are
still
staring
vacantly

at
his
chest

on
a
round
blue
button
pinned
to
his
shirt
with
10
years
on
it
i
promise

buffy
doesn't
look
excited
by
the
idea
manny
turns
to
the
wall
where
a
time
clock
is
mounted
next
to
a
rack
full
of
cards
he
removes
a
card
and
inserts
it
into
the
clock
then
removes
it
and
hands
it
to
buffy
congratulations

on
the
clock
buffy
looks
at
her
timecard
still
not
thrilled

wearing
the
redandwhite
striped
uniform
are
moving
around
preparing

using
a
hobart
to
slice
some
sort
of
meat
the
round
slices
fall
into
the
hopper

chicken
slices
continue
to
fall

in
slowly
on
buffy's
face
as
she
stares
at
it
mesmerized
zoom
in
closer
on
the
chicken
slices
buffy
snaps
out
of
it
as
we

that
buffy
looks
displeased
she
walks
past
him
cut
to
the
grill
buffy
stands
beside
it
as
philip
is
explaining
how
it
works
you
put
the
beef
on
the
grill
you
hit
the
button
then
it
beeps
you
flip
the
beef
hit
the
other
button
then
it
beeps
you
put
it
on
the
bun
philip
pauses
thinking
there's
not
a
button
for
that
repeat
until
insane
close
shot
on
the
grill
as
philip
puts
meat
patties
on
it
it
eliminates
variation
philip
pushes
button
every
burger
at
every
doublemeat
palace
is
the
same
philip
buffy
looking
at
him
people
don't
like
variation
got
it
variety
is
the
spice
of
bad
mm
philip
has
his
arms
crossed
staring
at
the
meat
steam
rises
as
the
meat
cooks
so
what's
the
secret
ingredient
philip
not
taking
his
eyes
off
the
grill
it's
a
meat
process
well
what
does
that
mean
it's
a
process
they
do
it
to
the
meat
but
what
is
it
it's
just
the
name
of
the
process
buffy
giving
up
oh
yeah
the
grill
beeps
philip
picks
up
a
metal
spatula
and
gives
it
to
buffy
so

get
kinda
greasy

on

disappears
willow
alarmed

the
ground
meat
with
her

finds
a
severed
human

it
up

buffy

she
shoves
a
customer's
tray
so
that

spills
grabs
a
burger
from
another
customer's
hand
we
see
the
family
from

as
buffy
grabs
their
food
away
from
them

whole
place

didn't
seem
all
braindead
he
didn't
show
up
this
morning
except

think
he
was
there
the
whole
time
as
the
secret
ingredient
we
need
to
analyze
that
burger
we
need
to
find
out
if
it
used
to
be
people
xander
turns
from
the
table
in
alarm
we
see
that
his
mouth
is
full
of
burger
what
buffy
and
dawn
turn
to
look
at
him
the
empty
burger

willow
goes
to
put
her
purse
on
the
table
she
touches
a
pencil
that's
sitting
on
the
table
and
it
goes
limp
as
if
the
pencil
had
turned
into
rubber
willow
quickly
picks
it
up
and
shoves
it
into
her
purse
to
hide
it
you
wouldn't
want
any
apparently
the
doublemeat
medley
is
people
xander
belches
and
puts
his
hand
over
his
mouth
willow
looks
at
the
burger
wrapper
in
disgust
whoa

one
time
or
even

one

over
california
dawn
disgusted

the
perfect
deal
everyone
expects
high
turnover
of

buffy
pauses
and
they
have
us
disposing
of
the
bodies

burger

any
way

with
science

i
can
use
science
willow
to
xander
you
ate
it
xander
puts
up
his
hand
as
if
to
say
'i
don't
want
to
talk
about
it'
um
we
have
the
wrapper
there's
little
scribbles
of
meat

the
wrapper
dawn
willow
nods
buffy
picking
up
her
jacket
okay

willow
breathing
heavily
cool

willow
looks
a
little
shaky
but
she
goes
to
the
table
and
starts
setting
up
dawn
walks
over
are
you
okay
i'm
just
worried
about
buffy
cut
to
exterior
shot
of
the
doublemeat
palace
all
dark
for
the
night
she
could
be
walking
into
anything
cut
to
inside
buffy
walks
slowly
through
the
dark
restaurant
she
opens
the
door
to
the
walkin
freezer
and
walks
in
looking
around
the
door
begins
to
swing
shut
behind
her
she
grabs
it
just
before
it
locks
her
in
she
leaves
the
freezer
cut
to
the
meat
grinder
buffy
touches
one
of
the
blades
then
looks
at
her
fingers
and
sniffs
them
she
crouches
down
to
look
at
the
opening
where
the
ground
meat
comes
out
metallic
noise
from
behind
buffy
turns
frowns
manny
she
gets
up
starts
walking
in
that
direction
suddenly
she
falls
down
out
of
shot
buffy
os
ohh
manny
she
stands
up
again
back
into
the
shot
holding
a
shoe
with
a
severed
foot
in
it
the
ankle
stump
is
bloody
the
shoes
are
the
style
manny
was
wearing
earlier
buffy
wrinkles
her
nose
guess
you
really
were
a
lifer
cut
to
the
magic
shop
dawn
and
xander
sit
at
the
counter
in
background
in
foreground
we
see
willow
with
a
microscope
and
a
bunch
of
testtubes
arrayed
in
front
of
her
several
of
the
test
tubes
hold
yellow
or
orange
liquid
willow
holds
a
beaker
of
green
liquid
willow
whispers
don't
need
magic
don't
need
it
don't
need
it
she
pours
the
green
liquid
into
some
of
the
test
tubes
pan
over
to
dawn
and
xander
my
friend
janice
her
sister's
a
lawyer
you
think
i
should
sue
over
the
burger
that's
interesting
no
i
just
mean
dawn
sighs
buffy's
never
gonna
be
a
lawyer
or
a
doctor
anything
big
she's
a
slayer
she
saves
the
whole
world
that's
way
bigger
but
that
means
she's
gonna
have
like
crap
jobs
her
entire
life
right
minimum
wage
stuff
i
mean
i
could
still
grow
up
to
be
anything
but
for
her
this
is
it
okay
but
maybe
you'll
be
a
lawyer
or
a
doctor
and
you
can
use
all
your
money
to
support
your
deadbeat
sister
dawn
sarcastic
oh
that's
terrifically
better
thanks
hey
guys
ii
think
i've
got
it
xander
and
dawn
get
up
walk
toward
willow
good
job
will
those
aren't
like
potions
are
they
no
no
potions
it's
not
magic
it's
chemistry
you
can
tell
by
how
damn
slow
it
is
xander
sits
beside
willow
as
dawn
stands
on
her
other
side
i
made
a
solution
that
reacts
to
the
proteins
in
human
blood
so
we're
pretty
close
to
knowing
for
certain
anya
comes
rushing
in
anya
panting
i'm
here
i'm
here
we're
doing
chemistry
oh
so
sorry
i
hurried
hey
did
your
friend
have
a
good
time
and
then
leave
anya
sullen
she's
gone
so
ahn
the
way
she
looked
with
the
face
xander
nervous
laugh
that
wasn't
what
you
used
to
look
like
was
it
is
there
something
wrong
with
that
i
mean
did
you
think
she
was
unattractive
okay
is
there
any
answer
to
that
question
that
won't
make
you
nuts
halfrek
was
always
considered
to
be
a
great
beauty
well
hon
she
was
a
little
xander
anya
glaring
there
was
some
veinyness
hold
this
willow
hands
something
to
xander
okay
if
the
solution
reacts
to
the
proteins
then
i'll
be
able
to
see
it
willow
quickly
i
mean
i'll
be
able
to
look
through
the
microscope
and
and
then
see
it
willow
bends
over
the
microscope
anya
to
xander
it's
not
like
you're
so
perfect
either
what
with
your
strangely
large
upper
arms
and
your
tendency
to
criticize
huh
dawn
to
willow
what
do
you
see
there's
no
reaction
oh
god
no
no
reaction
which
means
it's
not
human
xander
upset
it's
not
human
xander
realizing
it's
not
human
well
is
it
demony
i
mean
maybe
someone's
you
know
killing
demons
and
using
them
as
a
cheap
source
of
meat
i
mean
we've
all
heard
of
that
dawn
makes
a
very
disgusted
face
to
show
that
she
hasn't
heard
of
that
until
now
and
by
the
way
i'm
opposed
to
using
demon
meat
no
matter
how
much
money
it
saves
anya
to
xander
does
that
surprise
you
again
i
say
'huh'
willow
xander
still
looking
in
microscope
no
i'm
not
sure
what
i'm
seeing
cellulose
shot
of
the
slide
on
the
microscope
looks
like
a
lot
of
brownish
cells
clinging
together
willow
pulls
back
from
the
eyepiece
there's
something
weird
here
cut
back
to
the
doublemeat
palace
buffy
walks
slowly
through
the
kitchen
still
holding
the
severed
foot
she
sees
something
on
a
table
scalp
she
puts
the
foot
down
on
the
table
and
stares
at
the
thing
wig
buffy
picks
it
up
wig
lady
wig
lady
os
oh
dear
buffy
turns
to
find
the
old
lady
standing
behind
her
bald
wig
lady
is
that
what
they
call
me
buffy
stares
at
her
frowning
i
don't
care
for
that
wig
lady
takes
a
few
steps
closer
i
mean
i
have
to
do
something
to
hide
this
a
huge
snakelike
thing
pushes
its
way
out
of
the
top
of
her
bald
head
its
eyes
are
her
eyes
so
it
leaves
her
face
eyeless
and
sagging
it
has
a
round
bald
head
and
a
toothy
mouth
with
the
eyes
underneath
the
mouth
it
extends
to
at
least
ten
feet
long
still
connected
to
the
old
lady
and
hovers
in
the
air
in
front
of
buffy's
face
the
face
on
the
end
of
it
squeals
and
suddenly
squirts
a
mist
at
buffy
buffy
tries
to
get
away
but
finds
she
can't
move
it's
paralyzing
don't
try
to
move
dear
you
really
can't
much
the
snakehead
thing
continues
to
squeal
and
move
toward
buffy
as
she
tries
to
back
away
blackout
act
iv

open
on
the
same
scene
the
wig
lady
stands
there
with
the
snake
creature
protruding
from
her
head
buffy
manages
to
break
free
and
jump
to
the
side
as
the
creature
strikes
out
at
her
the
paralysis
spreads
upward
by
the
way
you
may
want
to
flail
your
arms
a
bit
while
you
still
can
buffy
is
struggling
away
slowly
gripping
the
counter
for
support
the
wig
lady
follows
did
i
tell
you
you're
my
favorite
we
get
a
close
shot
of
her
face
clearly
showing
that
she
has
no
eyes
buffy
glances
back
continues
trying
to
get
away
doublemeat
workers
you're
all
so
full
of
doublemeat
burgers
and
you
just
slide
down
so
smooth
buffy
reaches
the
end
of
the
counter
she's
leaning
on
falls
to
the
floor
and
tries
to
push
herself
back
up
oh
i
just
love
the
paralysis
it
means
i
can
eat
you
slowly
the
snakehead
is
right
up
in
buffy's
face
suddenly
she
hits
it
with
something
and
it
flies
aside
squealing
buffy
begins
crawling
along
the
floor
using
mainly
her
arms
cut
to
outside
willow
walks
up
to
the
front
door
and
tries
to
open
it
but
it's
locked
she
puts
her
hands
against
the
glass
and
peers
inside
cut
back
to
inside
buffy
still
pulling
herself
along
the
floor
shot
of
the
wig
lady's
feet
walking
toward
her
buffy
reaches
the
other

using

buffy
cringes
willow

voice
seems
to
come
from
nowhere
sounding
tinny
cut
to
outside
willow
stands
beside
the
drivethrough
ordering
station
talking
into
the
microphone
i

buffy
crouching
behind
a
metal
table
with
the
wig
lady
on
the
other
side
buffy
looks
alarmed
begins
to
move
again
pulling
herself
along
the
floor
beside
the
metal
counter
willow
os
buffy
if

the
burger

suddenly
the
snake
head
comes
between
the
sections
of
the
counter
and
faces
buffy
squealing
she
gasps
and
ducks
down
to
slither
underneath
the
bottom
shelf
cut
to

still
talking
they
aren't

along
underneath

tablescounters
buffy

something

bad
about

cut
back
to
the
kitchen
buffy
pokes
her
head
out
from
under
the
table
looking
around
cautiously
willow
os
it
was
amy's
power
but
but
it
felt
like
i
was
doing
everything
myself
and
i
couldn't
stop
and
now
it's
gone
and
i
feel
kinda
shaky
and
like
i
i
need
it
buffy
buffy
looks
around
doesn't
see
anything
begins
to
crawl
out
suddenly
the
wig
lady
appears
the
snake
head
in
buffy's
face
again
she
slides
back
underneath
but
the
wig
lady
bends
over
and
grabs
buffy's
shoulders
hauls
her
out
and
onto
her
feet
then
the
lady
just
stands
there
as
the
snake
head
begins
to
bite
at
the
shoulder
of
buffy's
jacket
buffy
gasps
in
pain
reaches
behind
her
trying
to
find
something
on
the
counter
that
she
can
use
as
a
weapon
but
she
only
manages
to
push
some
stuff
off
onto
the
floor
the
wig
lady
grabs
buffy
again
cut
to
outside
willow
alarmed
buffy
something
fell
cut
back
to
inside
the
wig
lady
shoves
buffy
across
the
room
she
bumps
up
against
the
meat
grinder
and
her
hand
hits
the
red
button
the
grinder
blades
begin
to
whirl
the
snake
head
still
has
hold
of
buffy's
shoulder
and
is
biting
her
buffy
seems
completely
paralyzed
willow
runs
in
buffy
the
wig
lady
and
the
snake
head
both
turn
to
look
at
willow
visitors
how
nice
the
snake
head
spits
its
paralyzing
liquid
at
willow
she
shrieks
and
jumps
aside
the
wig
lady
and
snake
head
turn
back
to
buffy
it
resumes
biting
buffy
suddenly
willow
appears
behind
the
wig
lady
missed
me
she
swings
something
severing
the
snake
body
right
above
the
wig
lady's
head
the
snake
mouth
squeals
and
lets
go
of
buffy
leaving
a
bloody
wound
on
her
shoulder
buffy
falls
to
the
floor
the
wig
lady
groans
and
sways
back
and
forth
we
get
a
really
nice
disgusting
shot
of
the
severed
stump
on
her
head
oozing
yellow
liquid
the
lady
and
the
severed
snake
creature
fall
to
the
floor
beside
buffy
the
creature
is
still
wriggling
and
squealing
buffy
buffy
lifts
her
hand
holding
a
plastic
butter
knife
she
stabs
the
snake
with
it
it
continues
to
squeal
willow
runs
over
and
grabs
the
snake
creature
wrestles
it
up
and
throws
it
into
the
grinder
all
seems
quiet
for
an
instant
then
the
snake
head
reappears
over
the
edge
of
the
grinder
compartment
squealing
willow
screams
and
shoves
it
back
down
into
the
grinder
squealing
noises
die
away
accompanied
by
disgusting
squishy
noises
willow
leans
down
and
helps
buffy
up
buffy
are
you
all
right
paralyzed
but
i
think
it's
wearing
off
willow
smiling
i
did
it

killed

buffy
look
shot
of
the
inside
of
the
grinder
as
the
blades
go
round
and
round
chopping
the
graygreen
creature
into
smaller
bright
green
pieces
with
lots
of
yellowish
blood
very
icky
buffy
and
willow
look
then

over
to
the
part
where
the
ground

had
fun
shut
up
oh

sharp
argument

got
there

my
friend

cut
to
interior
of
the
doublemeat
palace
employee
lounge

bundle
of

to
leave
pauses
and
turns

sits
at

a
formed
and
texturized
vegetablebased
meatlike
product
suitable
for

blended
with
large
amounts
of
rendered
beef
fat
for
flavor

secret
ingredient
in
the
beef
is
beef
buffy

powerful

doublemeat
reputation
is
built
on
a
foundation
of
well
meat
