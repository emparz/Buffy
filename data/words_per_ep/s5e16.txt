follows

as
smiling
she
carries
dishes
into

as
we
realize
this
was
all
in
buffy's
imagination
she
is
still
standing
there
watching
the

work
utter
silence
except
the
sound

did
die
a
good
while
before
you

her
there's
nothing
you
could
have
done
in
the
background
we
see
paramedic
1
packing
up
removing
the
wires
from
joyce's
chest
wwhat
the
camera
shows
paramedic

from
around
the
nose
area
to
midchest
his
eyes
and
the
top
of
his
head
are
off
the
top
of
the
screen
i'm
guessing
it
must
have
been
a
aneurysm
or
some
clotting
some
complication
from
surgery
she
probably
felt
buffy
staring
at
him
with
tears
in
her
eyes
very
little
pain
i'm
gonna
call
it
in
the
coroner's
office

come
by
and
take
her
in
and
they'll
determine
the
cause
of
death
conclusively

offscreen
while
the

focuses
on
buffy's
stunned
expression
now
it

again
to
the
shot
of
the
paramedic's
lower
face
now
the
coroner's
office
may
take
a
while
in

a
glass
of
water
and
try
not
to
disturb
the
body
buffy
still
staring
up
at
him

tears
in

buffy
in
the
face
love
you
so
much
i
know
dawn
to
tara
they're
not

us
anything
giles

looking
around
when
suddenly
anya
hugs
him
he
looks
surprised
then
hugs
her
back
over
her
head
he
notices
the
doctor
doctor
everyone
looks
over
at
the
doctor
he
walks
forward
buffy
giles
and
dawn
come
forward
to
meet
him
the
others
stay
behind
in
a
little
group
okay
i've
examined
your
mother's
body
can
we
see
her
dawn
not
now
the
onsite
report
seems
more
or
less
accurate
your
mother
did
have
what
looks
like
an
aneurysm
a
sudden
hemorrhaging
from
a
ruptured
arterial
vessel
near
the
uh
where
the
tumor
was
removed
shouldn't
we
have
known
about
that
that
was
a
danger
sometimes
these
things
are
detectable
and
sometimes
they're
not
close
shot
of
buffy's
face
dr
kriegel
os
joyce
was
aware
of
the
possibility
of
a
rupture
and
the
effects
she
didn't
even
get
on
the
phone
so
clearly
this
was
very
sudden
shot
of
dawn
staring
at
the
floor
dr
kriegel
os
she
uh
may
have
felt
a
little
nausea
and
probably
passed
out
as
it
happened
close
shot
of
buffy's
face
dr
kriegel
os
i
doubt
there
was
much
pain
and
even
if
someone
had
been
by
her
side
joyce
in
the
living
room
buffy
by
her
side

a
lot
of
pain
dr
kriegel
nods
absolutely
the
doctor's
mouth
continues

move
but
what

falls
to
