xander
in
his
basement
with
a
knife
in
his
hand
i
don't
know
i
was
going
for
ferocious
scary
but
it's
coming
out
more
dryly
sardonic
it
does
appear
to
be
mocking
you
with
its
eyeholes
the
nose
hole
seems
sad
and
full
of
selfloathing
xander
turns
the
jackolantern
around
to
show
to
buffy
who's
laying
on
his
bed
what
do
you
think
buff
i
was
just
thinking
about
the
life
of
a
pumpkin
grow
up
in
the
sun
happily
entwined
with
others
then
someone
comes
along
cuts
you
open
and
rips
your
guts
out
okay
and
on
that
happy
note
i've
got
a
treat
for
tomorrow
nights
second
annual
halloween
screening
people
prepare
to
have
your
spines
tingled
your
gooses
bumped
by
the
terrifying
xander
pulls
out
a
video
and
reads
the
title
fantasia
fantasia
maybe
it's
because
of
all
the
horrific
things
we've
seen
but
hippos
wearing
tutus
just
don't
unnerve
me
the
way
they
used
to
phantasm
it
was
supposed
to
be
'phantasm
i
thought
we
were
doing
the
alpha
delt
thing
what
thing
the
scary
house
sounds
kinda
lame
it
actually
borders
on
fun
you
have
to
go
through
the
scary
house
maze
to
get
to
the
party
which
is
usually
worth
getting
to
those
guys
go
all
out
as
witnessed
last
friday
very
true
there
is
a
party
we
didn't
tell
you
no
it's
cool
you
guys
got
your
little
college
thing

fine
i
mean
i
got
better
things
to
do
than
tag
along
to
some
fraternity
you
can
come
okay
but
only
because
i
lied
about
having
better
things
to
do
a
blast
will
be
had
by
all
buffy
gets
up
i'm
gonna
get
going
now

xander
looks
at
his
watch
okay

a
little
mature
but
still
i'm
sleepy
you
guys
have
fun
you
want
me
to
come
with
buffy
leaves
no
i'm
fine
xander
shakes
his
head
sad
buffy
she
didn't
even
touch
her
pumpkin
it's
a
freak
with
no
face
she's
still
suffering
a
little
postparker
depression
bailing
on
the
buff
does
anyone
else
want
to
smack
that
guy
all
three
raise
their
hands
cut
to
buffy
walking
down
the
street
alone
a
demon
jumps
out
at
her
screaming
and
she
hits
it
in
the
face
knocking
it
down
it
pulls
of
its
mask
to
reveal
a
young
kid
jeez
that
hurt
what
the
hell
is
wrong
with
you
lady
gets
up
and
walks
away

what
i'd
like
to
know
intro

cut
to
uc
of
sunnydale
willow
and
buffy
are
walking
into
the
cafeteria
i've
got
the
basics
down
–
levitation
charms
glamours
i
just
feel
like
i've
plateaued
wiccawise
what's
the
next
level
transmutation
conjuring
bringing
forth
something
from
nothing
gets
pretty
close
to
the
primal
forces
a
little
scary
well
no
one's
pushing
you
know
if
it's
too
much
don't
do
it
don't
do
it
what
kind
of
encouragement
is
that
this
is
an
'encouragement'
talk
i
thought
it
was
'share
my
pain'
i
don't
know
then
again
what
is
college
for
if
not
experimenting
you
know
maybe
i
can
handle
it
i'll
know
when
i've
reached
my
limit
oz
comes
up
to
them
wine

with
her
banana

with
you
on
the

about
the
fact
that

what
it's
like
to
have
power
you
can't
control
i
mean
every
time
i
start
to
wolf
out
i
touch
something
–deep

happily
vacationing
in
the
land
of

don't
want
to
meet

tonight
but
–

doublecheck

doesn't
care
about
halloween
cut
to
giles
opening
his
door
dressed

such
a
thing

my
watcher's
duties
took
precedence
i
simply
haven't
taken
time
to
–
well
to
embrace
its
inherent
charms
–
until
now
giles
turns
on
a
frankenstein
puppet
hanging
from
the
ceiling
look

giles
laughs
it's
alive
buffy
just
stares
at
him

–
how
he
shakes

there
something
you
wanted
i
was
thinking
that
i
should
patrol
tonight

know
possibly
the
cemetery
or
if
you
had
a
better
su
buffy
stares
distractedly
at
the
fringe
dangling
from
the
edge
of
his
sombrero
could
you
please
take
that
off
giles
sets
down
the
bowl
of
candy
oh
yes
of
course
giles
takes
the
hat
off
i
see
is
there
some
specific
danger
you
were
sensing
no
but
then
you
know
we
were
all
caught
of
guard
when
ethan
turned
everyone
into
their
costumes
true
but
what
happened
then
was
anomalous
creatures
of
the
night
shy
away
form
halloween
they
find
it
all
much
too
crass
hard
to
believe
well
ii
promise
you
there
is
little
likelihood
of
any
supernatural
activity
tonight
giles

the
party

here
scary
sound
effects
start
to
play
loudly
oz
looks
at
the

unhappily
cranking
xander

at
oz
you're
sensing
a
disturbance
in
the
force
master
oz
pulls
out
a
folding
pocketknife
ah
the
left
speaker
is
crackling
a
little
bit
and
you
feel
stabbing
it
is
the
proper
solution
i'm
just
going
to
trim
the
wire
it
might
be
a
short
xander
nods
and
turns
away
oz
straightens
up
ah
oz
cut
myself
it's
okay
he
walks
over
shaking
his
hand
some
blood
drops
on
the
symbol
on
the
floor
playing
with
knives
fun
yes
but
not
safe
and
when
you
bleed
to
death
i've
got
dibs
on
your
equipment
a
ripple
runs
over
the
symbol
but
no
one
notices
one
of
the
plastic
spiders
at
its
edge
coming
alive
and
crawling
away
cut
to
joyce
altering
a
red
cape
on
her
sewing
machine
thanks
again
for
doing
this
at
the
last
minute
i'm
just
glad
i
could
find
it
there
try
it
now
i
let
down
the
hem
and
loosened
it
a
little
around
the
hood
buffy
puts
it
on
oh
it
feels
better
joyce
smiles
at
buffy
oh
no
someone
is
getting
nostalgic
face
i'm
sorry
i'm
thinking
about
the
little
girl
who
wore
that
what
is
it
five
six
years
ago
yeah
little
red
riding
hood
was
the
cutting
edge
in
costumes
joyce
laughs
your
father
loved
to
take
you
out
he
was
such
a
pain
12
years
old
and
i
can't
go
trickortreating
by
myself
he
just
wanted
to
keep
you
safe
no
he
wanted
the
candy
i
was
just
the
beard
oh
that's
not
true
actually
the
candy
was
for
me
your
father
loved
spending
time
with
you
buffy
looks
down
not
enough
i
guess
buffy
oh
that
just
paved
right
over
memory
lane
huh
our
divorce
had
nothing
to
do
with
you
buffy
swallows
i
don't
know
–
i'm
starting
to
feel
like
there
is
a
pattern
here
–
open
your
heart
to
someone
and
he
bails
on
you
maybe
it's
easier
to
just
not
let
anyone
in
joyce
gets
up
i
thought
it
might
be
easier
you
must
have
noticed
that
i
am
not
exactly
the
social
butterfly
i
was
when
i
was
with
your
dad
i
don't
think
i
made
a
single
new
friend
the
year
we
moved
to
sunnydale
why
not
fear
i
didn't
believe
i
could
trust
anyone
again
it's
taken
time
and
a
lot
of
effort
but
i've
got
a
nice
circle
of
friends
now
i
mean
don't
get
me
wrong
i
–
i'm
still
a
little
gun
shy
it
certainly
didn't
help
that
my
last
boyfriend
turned
out
to
be
a
homicidal
robot
joyce
sits
down
next
to
buffy
i
will
always
be
here
for
you
and
you
got
mr
giles
and
your
friends
buffy

at
her

nothing
to
be
afraid
of
cut

hanging
from
its
socket
sitting

punch
bowl
on

traumatic
willow
walks
into
a
cobweb
decorating
a
doorway
and
screams
uh

cobweb
willow
pulls
it
off
of
her
okay
that
part
was
realistic
frat

obsessive
with
their
cleaning

not
be
decoration
per
se
the
plastic
skeleton
with
the
knife
swings
out
at
xander
and
he
jumps
xander
panting
i
wasn't
scared
i
was
in
the
spirit

and
notices
a
real
tarantula
on
her
shoulder
willow
sees
what
he
is
looking
at
and
screams
uh

it
off
oz
brushes

party
willow
to
oz

yeah
they
walk
into
a
room
and
buffy
bends
down
to
examine
a
spot
on
the
carpet
i
thought

to
xander

the
ceiling

covered
with
real
bats
all

and
cover
their
heads
as
the
bats
suddenly
drop
down
and
fly
off
down
the
hall
oz

over
and
picks
up
a
bat
that
is
laying
on
the
floor

be
rubber

made
of
rubber
buffy
looks
around
what
the
hell
is
going

nothing

it's
just
a
neat
trick

might
be
something
else
cut

furry
white
bunny

of
a
solid
wall
where

the
door
anya
knocks
on
the
wall
hey

she
sighs
and
walks
back
out
to
the
street
she
hears
a
scream
coming
from
the
house
and
looks
up
to
see
a
girl
banging
against
one
of
the
upper
story
windows
help
me

me
the
stones
surrounding
the
window

buffy
and
co
walking
back
into

dealing
with
it
i'll
know
what
it

hear
something
like
i
said

like
a
hissing
buffy
puts
down
her
basket

like
a
'ssss'
noise
i
thought
the
word
hissing
kind
of
covered
that
nicely
buffy
pulls
open
the
door
to
a
closet
there
is
a
guy
in
there
rocking
back
and
forth
i'm
sorry

happening
chaz
rocking
harder
it
ah
buffy
impatiently
what
is
it
it's
alive
it's
alive
cut
to
the
plastic
skeleton
cut
to
the
knife
in
its
hand
as
the
camera
pans
back
up
the
bones
are
suddenly
real
there
is
an
eyeball
in
one
of
its
sockets
it
straightens
its
head
and
looks
at
the
camera
cut
to
buffy
what's
alive
he's
in
shock
chaz
what
happened
here
chaz
looks
up
and
screams
as
he
sees
the
skeleton
come
up
and
stab
at
buffy's
shoulder
from
behind
buffy
turns
and
knocks
its
head
aside
then
kicks
it
in
the
middle
it
lies
back
to
land
on
the
ground
once
again
plastic
buffy
stares
at
it
then
checks
her
shoulder
i
think
the
cape
took
most
of
it'
let
me
see
could
need
stitches
you
should
at
least
get
a
bandage
or
something
a
girl
screams
and
chaz
crawls
back
into
the
closet
and
closes
the
door
cowering
in
a
closet
is
starting
to
seem
like
a
reasonable
plan
buffy
looks
back
over
her
shoulder
what
closet
buffy
looks
and
there
is
only
a
blank
wall
i'm
gonna
make
my
way
upstairs
and
see
if
there
are
any
people
up
there
buffy
picks
up
her
basket
you
guys
find
a
way
out
of
the
house
and
use
it
you're
telling
us
to
run
away
and
leave
you
behind
buffy
pulls
a
loaded
crossbow
out
we
need
help
we
need
the
only
person
that
can
make
sense
of
what's
happening
cut
to
giles
sitting
with
his
bowl
of
candy
looking
bored
there
is
an
insistent
knock
on
the
door
and
he
gets
up
giles
swallows
his
candy
just
a
minute
coming
giles
opens
the
door
happy
hall
anya
walks
past
him
xander
is
in
trouble
we've
got
to
do
something
right
now
giles
stares
at
her
with
his
mouth
hanging
open
anya
are
you
listening
xander
is
trapped
uh
ah
where
is
buffy
and
the
others
they're
trapped
too
but
we've
got
to
save
xander
giles
takes
off
his
sombrero
and
sits
down
slow
down
i
need
you
to
be
more
specific
uhm
ah
we
were
supposed
to
meet
at
this
house
and
i
got
there
and
there
was
no
door
where
a
door
should
be
and
then
i
see
this
girl
standing
in
a
window
and
then
poof
she's
gone
she
vanished
from
the
window
no
the
window
vanished
from
the
house
hmm
matter
and
reality
distortion
giles
goes
and
pulls
a
book
from
his
shelf
like
a
summoning
spell's
temporal
flux
what
hmm
oh
never
mind
i
just
need
to
get
some
supplies
together
giles
looks
over
at
anya
i
wouldn't
worry
about
xander
at
least
he's
amongst
friends
cut
to
buffy
will
i'm
telling
you
you're
telling
me
you're
telling
me
i
can't
do
my
job
if
i
have
to
worry
about
each
of
your
safety
it's
not
your
decision
got
to
disagree
with
you
there
oh
of
course
you
do
let's
all
take
a
breath
buffy
maybe
being
the
slayer
doesn't
automatically
make
you
boss
you're
as
lost
as
the
rest
of
us
what
are
we
talking
about
it's
a
simple
incantation
a
guiding
spell
for
travelers
when
they
become
lost
or
disoriented
and
how
does
it
work
it
conjures
an
emissary
from
the
beyond
that
–
lights
the
way
conjuring
will
let's
be
realistic
here
okay
your
basic
spells
are
usually
only
fiftyfifty
willow
upset
oh
yeah
well
so
is
your
face
willow
walks
off
while
buffy
tries
to
figure
out
what
that
meant
what
buffy
walks
after
willow
what
does
that
mean
willow
turns
around
i'm
not
your
sidekick
willow
stomps
out
oz
runs
after
her
buffy
stands
there
and
sighs
well
that
was
a
bunch
of
laughs
buffy
walks
past
him
back
to
her
basket
look
buffy
we
are
all
tired
and
a
little
edgy
maybe
willow
is
overreacting
i'm
sure
part
of
it
is
because
of
how
you've
been
'pushing
away'
girl
lately
buffy
picks
up
her
crossbow
ignoring
him
totally
but
now
is
not
the
time
to
let
that
stuff
tear
us
apart
buffy
turns
to
go
what
i'm
saying
is
i'm
right
with
ya

right
by
your
side

buffy
looks
around

hall
xander
xander
follows
her
after

beat
buffy
xander
walks
into
a
room
lit
by
candles
the
walls
are
covered
with
cobwebs
buff

back
down

she
thinks

dark
forces
as
good
as

something
called
gachnar

somehow
the
beginning
of
the
spell
must
have
been
triggered

gachnar
is
trying
to
manifest
itself

come
into
being
how
iit
feeds
on
fear
our
fears
are
manifesting
it
we're
feeding
it
we
need
to
stop
if
we're
close
our
eyes
and
say
it's
a
dream
it'll
stab
us
to
death
these
things
are
real
release

close
up
of
