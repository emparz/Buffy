prologue
fade
to
white
a
white
sheet
descends
and
we
see
buffy
draping
it
over
a
bed
she
is
in
her
bedroom
at
home
making
her
bed
through
the
windows
it
looks
like
its
late
afternoon
as
sunlight
shines
into
the
room
buffy
smoothing
the
edges
they
smell
good
don't
they
the
camera
pulls
back
and
we
see
faith
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
matching
buffy's
movements
what
buffy
smiling
clean
sheets
like
summer
i
wouldn't
know
buffy
stops
smiling
right
i
forgot
i
noticed
buffy
hesitantly
ii
wish
i
could
stay
but
oh
you
have
to
go
it's
just
with
faith
knowingly
little
sis
coming
i
know
so
much
to
do
before
she
gets
here
they've
worked
their
way
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
now
and
are
beside
each
other
buffy
regretfully
now
i
really
have
to
so
go
don't
let
me
keep
she
stops
as
she
hears
something
she
looks
down
and
sees
that
two
drops
of
blood
have
hit
the
sheet
a
dark
red
on
the
clean
white
two
more
drops
quickly
follow
faith
looks
at
buffy
damn
just
when
we
made
it
so
nice
she
straightens
and
looks
down
at
her
body
as
she
faces
buffy
she
lifts
her
eyes
to
meet
buffy's
whose
expression
has
suddenly
become
stoic
faith
concerned
are
you
ever
gonna
take
this
thing
out
she
indicates
to
her
abdomen
close
up
of
buffy's
hand
wrapped
around
the
handle
of
faith's
large
knife
the
one
buffy
had
stabbed
her
with
cannot
see
the
blade
because
most
of
it
is
in
faith's
stomach
and
blood
is
seeping
from
the
wound
buffy's
face
is
emotionless
as
she
gazes
into
faith's
eyes
a
second
later
she
suddenly
jerks
the
knife
upwards
horrified
faith
opens
her
mouth
in
a
silent
scream
cut
to
a
close
up
of
the
screen
of
a
heart
monitor
it
is
beeping
steadily
with
the
heartbeat
it's
monitoring
the
camera
pans
to
show
us
a
drab
blue
wall
with
the
paint
peeling
showing
plaster
the
room
is
dimly
lit
there
is
an
iv
stand
next
to
the
bed
the
tube
leading
to
the
comatose
patient
lying
there
faith
is
in
a
room
that
obviously
doesn't
see
much
human
presence
from
a
window
we
cannot
see
lightning
flashes
outside
and
splashes
across
her
face
faith
continues
to
sleep
wolf's
howl
buffy
theme
and
credits
roll
part
one

fade
in
close
up
of
an
initiative
taser
rifle
the
top
panel
of
the
weapon
is
off
and
hanging
to
the
side
trailing
wires
as
xander
examines
the
inside
with
a
pair
of
pliers
in
his
hand
so
here
it
is
the
latest
in
stateoftheart
combat
technology
i
gotta
say
it
doesn't
look
that
complicated
the
camera
pulls
back
and
we're
in
xander's
basement
he
has
the
weapon
on
the
counter
willow
is
standing
next
to
him
with
tools
in
her
hands
should
he
need
them
buffy
is
standing
behind
them
behind
her
giles
is
seated
on
the
couch
folding
a
basket
of
laundry
on
the
coffee
table
so
can
you
repair
it
sure
as
soon
as
i
get
my
master's
degree
in
advanced
starship
technology
frustrated
xander
drops
the
pliers
on
the
counter
and
lets
the
rifle
fall
on
its
side
well
why
don't
we
experiment
willow
eagerly
press
some
buttons
see
what
happens
giles
folding
a
pair
of
boxers
uh
ii'd
like
to
veto
that
second
it's
called
a
blaster
will
a
word
that
tends
to
discourage
experimentation
now
if
it
were
called
the
orgasmator
i'd
be
the
first
to
try
your
basic
button
press
approach
just
tell
me
can
you
repair
it
or
not
buffy
turns
and
walks
towards
the
couch
xander
rights
the
rifle
again
and
picks
up
a
screwdriver
but
if
i
blow
a
hole
in
my
mom's
azalea
patch
the
neighbors
will
not
be
pleased
buffy
sits
down
on
the
couch
and
rests
her
head
on
the
palm
of
her
hand
tiredly
are
you
alright
giles
he
moves
to
sit
closer
to
her
you've
been
patrolling
round
the
clock
for
three
days
straight
now
i
thought
you
could
use
some
buffy
lifts
her
head
what
some
rest
there's
a
demonoid
killing
machine
out
there
giles
it
doesn't
only
work
the
night
shift
i
was
going
to
say
perhaps
you
could
use
some
backup
but
um
now
you
mention
it
building
up
your
strength
may
not
be
a
bad
idea
buffy
to
xander
just
get
the
blaster
working
that's
all
the
strength
i
need
are
you
sure
why
because
ray
guns
aren't
in
the
slayer
handbook
well
you
haven't
seen
this
adam
thing
he's
the
terminator
without
the
bashful
charm
he's
deadly
and
the
last
time
we
met
he
kicked
my
ass
oh
no
blast
away
by
all
means
i
only
meantno
word
about
riley
willow
comes
and
sits
with
buffy
buffy
sits
back
crossing
her
arms
they
keep
telling
me
that
he's
fine
that's
all
they'll
say
maybe
they're
telling
the
truth
buffy
worried
maybe
i
don't
even
know
what
the
initiative's
version
of
fine
is
they
could
be
forcing
him
back
onto
medication
and
torturing
him
for
all
i
know
from
what
we've
seen
i
doubt
they'll
be
trying
to
hurt
him
the
only
thing
i
know
for
certain
is
that
my
boyfriend
is
locked
away
and
i'm
not
helping
xander's
back
is
to
us
he's
leaning
over
the
blaster
when
it
suddenly
lets
out
a
big
spark
he
does
a
short
electrocuted
dance
as
he
holds
it
in
his
hands
and
a
puff
a
smoke
is
rising
from
the
gun
willow
unaware
of
the
blast
maybe
giles
has
a
point
i
mean
riley
is
their
top
gun
guy
doesn't
make
sense
that
they'd
hurt
him
xander
has
let
go
of
the
blaster
and
turns
to
face
the
others
with
a
wideeyed
expression
on
his
face
he's
wavering
on
his
feet
still
feeling
the
effects
of
the
shock
and
sees
nobody
noticed
what
happened
without
a
word
he
turns
around
and
picks
up
the
weapon
again
to
continue
working
on
it
all
i
know
is
that
the
initiative
has
all
those
brainwashy
behaviour
modification
guys
so
so
what
happens
when
they
start
not
liking
his
behaviour
cut
to
initiative
infirmary
close
up
of
buffy's
red
scarf
lying
on
a
counter
riley's
reaches
out
to
take
it
and
closes
his
fist
around
it
his
right
hand
is
bandaged
up
the
camera
pans
and
sees
him
lying
on
a
bed
his
abdomen
is
also
heavily
bandaged
he
pushes
himself
to
a
sitting
position
groaning
and
putting
a
hand
against
the
wound
in
his
side
after
taking
a
couple
of
breaths
he
stands
up
grabbing
a
shirt
and
puts
it
on
as
he
heads
out
at
the
door
leading
into
the
infirmary
there
is
a
soldier
standing
guard
at
riley's
approach
he
turns
around
a
stands
in
front
of
the
doorway
stand
down
soldier
riley
starts
buttoning
up

up

to
soldier

the
man
at
ease
the
soldier
returns
to
his
original
position
with
a
glance
at
forrest
riley
steps
out
of
the
doorway
and
starts
walking
down
the
corridor
with
a
noticeable
limp
he
continues
to
button
his
shirt
forrest
falls
into
step
with
him
the
shish
kebab
that
walks
like
a
man
looks
like
you're
feeling
better
walking
around
threatening
people
and
all
that

in
my
way

shot
of
a
cloudy
sky
as
thunder

threatening
rain
the
sun
can
be
seen
trying
to
shine
through

faith
smiles
as
he
turns
to
open
the
picnic
basket
horror
suddenly
fills
her
expression
no
no
buffy
is
suddenly
standing
in
front
of
the
mayor
she's
in
black
clothes
and
a
long
dark
coat
she
has
faith's
knife
in
her
hand
and
swings
the
blade
down
across
his
throat
and
he
gags
before
he
can
fall
she
thrusts
the
knife
into
his
chest
she
pulls
it
out
and
lets
him
fall
and
her
emotionless
gaze
fixes
on
faith
i
told
you
i
had
things
to
do
faith
is
terrified
and
starts
backing
away
in
a
panic
she
turns
and
flees
on
her
hands
and
knees
buffy
is
holding
the
bloodcovered
knife
raised
at
the
elbow
and
calmly
stalks
after
her
cut
to
faith
lying
in
bed
again
zoom
in
further
cut
to
the
woods
nighttime
buffy
willow
and
xander
are
on
patrol
each
carrying
a
flashlight
spread
out
not
too
far
so
not
a
problem
willow
and
xander
split
from
buffy
as
they
reach
a
clump
of
bushes
the
camera
pulls
back
and
tracks
buffy's
progress
behind
her
are
two
trees
and
a
pair
of
red
legs
with
clawed
feet
tied
to
them
willow
and
xander's
flashlights
are
visible
on
the
other
side
of
the
trees
buffy
hears
a
crackling
sound
a
turns
her
eyes
widen
as
she
looks
up
willow
and
xander
are
already
gaping
at
the
sight
of
the
crucified
demon
suspended
high
between
the
two
trees
buffy
shines
her
light
on
the
body
and
sees
the
demon
was
eviscerated
it
was
sliced
down
the
middle
from
its
neck
to
lower
abdomen
its
flesh
pulled
open
wide
and
also
tied
to
the
trees
all
the
internal
organs
have
been
removed
and
the
ribcage
and
spine
are
clearly
visible
cut
to
xander's
basement
i've
never
seen
anything
like
that
and
i
can
go
a
long
healthy
stretch
without
seeing
anything
like
that
again
it
had
to
be
adam
who
killed
it
but
why
he's
studying
biology
human
demon
whoever
he
can
get
his
hands
on
and
take
apart
he's
finding
out
what
makes
things
work
i
really
don't
want
to
be
around
for
the
final
exam
it's
not
coming
to
that
the
initiative
created
this
thing
and
they
can't
stop
it
but
we
will
question
will
hiding
in
a
cavern
with
stockpiled
chocolate
goods
be
any
part
of
this
plan
no
xander
sits
next
to
willow
xander
to
willow
told
you
what's
first
riley
i'm
not
leaving
him
down

with
the
people
that
created
this
thing

need
you
to
hack
into
their
security
mainframe
and
buy
me
a
ten
minute
shut
down
of
operation
systems
that
could
be
tricky
not
impossible
if
you
can't
do
it
online
then
use
magic
xander
any
gear
you've
been
saving
for
a
rainy

towlines
then
blast
open
the
facility

find

high
school

what
day
is

friday

date

year
maybe
i
should
get
you
a
nurse
what
happened
to
the
school
don't
you
just
wanna
just
tell
me
well
it
was
a
tragedy
really
lots
of
students
died
the
principal
the
mayor
i
really
think
maybe
i
should
get
you
some
help
closeup
of
faith's
face
cut
to
faith
walking
outside
the
hospital
wearing
the
woman's
clothes
y'know
i
never
stopped
thinking
about
you
cut
to
buffy
and
riley
me
neither
all
i
had
in
there
was
this
one
little
part
of
you
riley
gives
her
bandana
piece
it's
just
the
scarf
part
of
me
really
sure
it
is
just
knowing
you
were
out
therethat
you
caredi
think
we're
being
watched
i
dunno
does
the
initiative
do
that
maybe
you
seem
a
littlesomewhere
else
is
there
anything
i
can
do
give
me
an
order
that's
what
i
do
isn't
it
follow
orders
you
don't
have
to
don't
i
all
my
life
that's
what
i've
been
groomed
to
do
they
say
jump
i
ask
how
high
i
get
the
job
done
just
don't
know
if
it's
the
right
job
anymore
i
know
how
you
feel
giles
used
to
be
part
of
this
council
and
for
years
all
they
ever
did
was
give
me
orders
ever
obey
them
sure
the
ones
i
was
going
to
do
anyway
the
point
is
i
quit
the
council
and
i
was
scared
but
it's
okay
now
now
see
that's
where
you
and
i
are
different
i
just
suck
at
the
whole
gray
area
thing
it's
a
choice
go
back
in
there
and
make
some
changes
from
the
inside
or
you
can
quit
the
team
fight
demons
in
your
own
way
you
make
it
sound
so
simple
i
don't
even
know
what
my
way
is
well
it's
time
to
find
out
i'm
a
soldier
i
got
a
way
which
one
of
them
good
man
buffy
and
riley
kiss
she
sits
in
his
lap
kisses
him
again
what're
you
doing
i
am
looking
for
brain
washy
chips
in
your
head
hehfinding
any
not
sure
but
i
should
probably
keep
looking
just
in
case
you've
been
strong
long
enough
riley
finn
i'm
here
for
you
and
we're
gonna
find
this
demon
and
we're
gonna
kill
it
together
and
in
the
meantime
you
are
gonna
stop
torturing
yourself
sure
about
that
it's
an
order
buffy
they
kiss
again
cut
to
hospital
doctor
talking
to
nurse
police
officer
watching
what
do
you
mean
she
just
wasn't
there
i
don't
know
i
came
to
check
the
monitors
like
i
always
do
at
eight
o'clock
eight
o'clock
is
my
shift
i
got
here
on
time
you
found
the
bed
in
this
condition
haven't
touched
a
thing
get
the
duty
rosters
and
check
the
log
i
wanna
know
exactly
what
happened
coma
patients
do
not
just
get
up
and
walk
away
we
are
checking
every
room
on
every
floor
walk
me
through
this
one
more
time
you
knew
this
woman
was
wanted
for
questioning
on
a
series
of
murders
and
there's
no
security
on
this
wing
you
don't
understand
there's
no
way
that
girl
was
gonna
wake
up
doctor
this
can't
be
happening
nurse
comes
in
did
you
find
her
another
woman
unconscious
and
badly
beaten
and
she's
been
stripped
detective
doctor
and
nurse
leave
in
a
hurry
nurse
goes
to
phone
dials
a
number
nurse
into
phone
it's
happened
send
the
team
cut
to
faith
walking
through
streets
gets
to
window
of
giles'
apartment
giles
from
inside
the
problem
for
me
seems
to
be
why
adam
ahs
stayed
dormant
as
long
as
he
has
when
he's
not
making
performance
art
out
of
other
demons
that
is
he's
probably
working
off
an
autonomic
power
source
and
because
he's
straight
out
of
the
box
he
needs
to
charge
up
a
while
shot
of
faith
at
window
okay
what's
he
charging
up
for
based
on
the
clues
i'll
go
with
killing
spree
and
that's
a
best
case
scenario
i
suppose
a
little
firepower
would
be
a
good
idea
right
now
riley
activates
blaster
xander
had
been
messing
with
much
to
xander's
amazement
hey
how'd
you
do
that
is
there
like
an
onoff
button
somewhere
here
blasters
are
easy
adam
won't
be
since
professor
walsh
designed
it
any
chance
she
left
instructions
lying
around
somewhere
willow
as
she
says
this
buffy
kisses
riley
and
faith
reacts
well
if
she
did
they're
gonna
be
in
the
initiative
faith
continues
to
stare
at
buffy
and
riley
which
we
can't
get
into
without
mounting
a
major
offensive
speak
for
yourself
riley
all
look
at
him
i'm
just
saying
i
must
admit
a
man
on
the
inside
would
be
a
really
good
idea
are
you
sure
you
wanna
be
double
agent
guy
i'm
not
exactly
sure
what
you'd
call
me
but
i
will
share
information
faith
is
still
looking
at
riley
it's
the
least
i
can
do
riley's
right
it
is
the
least
we
can
do
phone
rings
giles
answers
it
hello
what
yes
she
is
giles
motions
to
buffy
umit's
for
you
buffy
looking
surprised
hello
faith
watches
her
expectantly
what
sort
of
emergency
buffy
looks
unhappy
no
i
haven't
faith
leaves
thank
you
i'll
let
you
know
buffy
puts
phone
down
what
is
it
it's
faith
she's
awake
buffy
all
look
surprised
she
beat
someone
up
took
her
clothing
and
disappeared
out
of
the
hospital
no
one
knows
where
she
is
i'd
say
this
qualifies
for
a
worst
timing
ever
award
what
do
we
do
well
we
have
to
find
her
what
about
adam
i'd
hate
to
see
the
pursuit
of
a
homicidal
lunatic
get
in
the
way
of
pursuing
a
homicidal
lunatic
well
faith's
not
exactly
lowprofile
girl
i'll
patrol
and
wait
for
her
to
make
a
move
but
then
what
oooh
i
have
an
idea
beat
the
crap
out
of
her
good
plan
good
on
paper
but
we
still
have
a
decision
to
make
do
we
hand
her
over
to
the
cops
they
wouldn't
know
what
to
do
with
a
slayer
even
if
they
knew
we
existed
what
about
the
council
been
there
tried
that
not
unlike
smothering
a
forest
fire
with
napalm
as
i
recall
well
the
initiative
they
do
have
containment
facilities
one
word
evil
there's
no
way
around
it
faith
is
back
and
whether
i
like
it
or
not
she's
my
responsibility
yeah
too
bad
that
was
out
first
coma
ever
we
have
no
idea
where
she
is
we
don't
know
what
she's
thinking
what
she's
feeling
who
she's
doing
she
could
be
terrified
maybe
she
doesn't
even
remember
or
maybe
she
does
and
she's
sorry
and
she's
alone
hiding
somewhere
well
perhaps
there's
some
form
of
rehabilitation
we
just
haven't
thought
about
and
if
not
asskicking
makes
a
solid
plan
b
i'm
not
going
to
rule
it
out
first
thing
we
need
to
find
her
then
we
can
take
it
from
there
who's
faith
cut
to
university
campus
the
next
day
buffy
and
willow
walking
along
what
did
you
tell
him
the
truth
that
she's
my
wacky
identical
cousin
from
england
and
whenever
she
visits
hijinks
ensue
it's
good
you
guys
have
such
an
honest
relationship
no
i
told
him
the
story
i
vagued
up
a
few
bits
but
no
flatout
lies
that's
fair
how'd
you
handle
the
angely
parts
i
did
some
editing
it's
not
that
i'm
trying
to
hide
anything
from
riley
it's
just
that's
a
longer
conversation
and
i
had
a
faithhunt
to
do
any
luck
couldn't
find
her
don't
know
exactly
where
to
place
that
little
upcontinuum
at
least
you're
not
alone
on
this
i
bet
every
cop
in
sunnydale
is
out
there
looking
for
her
right
now
pressure's
definitely
on
i'm
telling
you
if
i
were
her
i'd
get
outta
dodge
post
hasty
faith
turns
from
looking
at
the
noticeboard
but
you're
not
me
fade
to
break
so
check
you
out
b
nice
the
big
girl
on
campus
thing's
really
working
for
you
i've
been
looking
for
you
i've
been
standing
still
for
eight
months
b
how
hard
did
you
look
are
you
alright
fivebyfive
it's
that
thing
about
a
coma
wake
up
all
rested
and
rejuvenated
and
ready
for
payback
so
much
for
pleasantries
huh
what
did
you
think
i'd
wake
up
and
we'd
go
for
tea
you
tried
to
gut
me
bonny
buffy
you'd
have
done
the
same
to
me
if
you'd
had
the
chance
lets
have
another
go
at
it
see
who
ends
on
top
it
doesn't
have
to
be
like
this
y'know
actually
i
think
it
has
to
be
exactly
like
this
faith
these
are
innocent
people
no
such
animal
i
guess
it
was
too
much
to
hope
that
you'd
use
your
downtime
to
reflect
and
grow
i
could
say
the
same
about
you
i
mean
you're
still
the
same
betterthanthou
buffy
i
mean
i
knew
it
somehow
i
kept
having
this
dream
i'm
not
sure
what
it
means
but
in
the
dream
the
selfrighteous
blond
chick
stabs
me
and
you
wanna
know
why
shot
of
willow
taking
her
backpack
off
her
shoulders
you
had
it
coming
that's
one
interpretation
but
in
my
dream
she
does
it
for
a
guy
willow
comes
towards
faith
from
behind
her
wielding
the
bag
faith
to
willow
try
it
red
and
you'll
lose
an
arm
faith
back
to
buffy
i
wake
up
to
find
the
blond
chick
isn't
even
dating
the
guy
she
was
so
nuts
about
before
i
mean
she's
moved
on
to
the
first
college
beefstick
she
meets
not
only
has
she
forgotten
about
the
love
of
her
life
but
she's
forgotten
about
the
chick
she
nearly
killed
for
him
so
that's
my
dream
that
and
some
stuff
about
cigars
and
a
tunnel
but
tell
me
college
girl
what
does
it
mean
to
me
mostly
that
you
still
mouth
off
about
things
you
don't
understand
buffy
hears
sirens
uhoh
i
guess
somebody
knows
you're
here
faith
punches
buffy
around
the
face
they
fight
as
the
police
approach
willow
attacks
faith
from
behind
she
turns
and
is
grabbed
by
buffy
she
breaks
free
you
took
my
life
b
payback's
a
bitch
look
who's
talking
see
you
around
faith
runs
off
throws
a
police
officer
aside
runs
over
their
car
and
runs
over
a
field
pushing
people
aside
with
buffy
in
pursuit
faith
leaps
over
a
wall
buffy
looks
over
it
to
find
faith
has
disappeared
cut
to
a
staircase
at
university
willow
and
tara
going
down
them
thanks
for
coming
with
hunting
for
a
psychopathic
superbitch
is
definitely
in
the
above
and
beyond
category
it's
okay
really
so
what
do
we
do
if
we
find
her
run
flee
maybe
skedaddle
we're
not
here
to
engage
this
is
strictly
recon
tara
smiles
what
you
said
recon
you're
like
cool
monster
fighter
well
technically
faith
isn't
a
monster
and
as
far
as
fighting
i'd
be
lucky
to
bruise
her
fist
with
my
face
oh
what
facepunching
i'm
not
so
good
with
the
whole
tara
imitates
throwing
punches
rather
badly
swimming
violence
don't
worry
we're
sure
to
spot
faith
first
she's
like
this
cleavagy
slutbomb
walking
around
ooh
check
me
out
i'm
wickedcool
i'm
fivebyfive
fivebyfive
five
what
by
five
what
see
that's
the
thing
noone
knows
buffy
can
handle
faith
and
you're
plenty
safe
with
me
so
umwe
recon
till
nightfall
then
the
ritual
hiding
begins
cut
to
xander
and
giles
in
the
streets
looking
for
faith
the
point
being
i
could
be
the
target
here
faith
finds
mr
xander
harris
still
in
town
she
goes
tighter
than
cat
gut
got
a
lotta
pentup
feelings
there
i'm
only
saying
giles
wearily
yes
i'm
sure
see
i
can't
be
held
responsible
for
the
effect
i
have
on
women
no
see
faith
and
i
have
this
little
thing
between
us
called
history
rattling
they
look
around
xander
charges
the
blaster
they
go
towards
the
sound
spike
comes
out
of
the
darkness
spike
what
are
you
doing
here
me
hey
i'm
not
the
one
out
of
place
here
for
your
information
smarty
we've
got
a
rogue
slayer
on
our
hands
real
psychokiller
too
sounds
serious
it
is
what
do
you
know
what
do
you
need
her
dark
hair
yay
xander
indicates
tall
name
of
faith
criminally
insane
have
you
seen
her
is
this
bird
after
you
in
a
bad
way
yeah
tell
you
what
i'll
do
then
i'll
head
out
find
this
girl
tell
her
exactly
where
you
are
and
then
watch
as
she
kills
you
spike
sees
their
looks
of
surprise
and
irritation
can't
any
one
of
your
damn
little
scooby
club
at
least
try
to
remember
that
i
hate
you
all
just
because
i
can't
do
the
damage
myself
doesn't
stop
me
from
aiming
a
loose
cannon
your
way
and
here
i
thought
the
evening
be
dull
go
ahead
you
wouldn't
even
recognise
her
dark
hair
this
tall
spike
indicates
name
of
faith
criminally
insane
like
this
girl
already
xander
and
giles
watch
him
leave
we're
dumb
cut
to
another
new
woman
watching
police
helicopters
flying
around
pan
around
faith
is
walking
around
the
streets
about
to
go
into
a
shop
selling
blades
see
a
police
car
coming
around
the
corner
she
ducks
into
a
corner
some
kind
of
monster
comes
up
to
her
faith
your
friend
sent
me
i
got
a
little
remembrance
from
him
she
beats
the
monster
up
and
takes
the
case
from
him
then
another
police
car
comes
around
the
corner
she
goes
quickly
up
a
ladder
dodging
his
searchlight
once
up
the
ladder
she
opens
the
case
hello
faith
if
you're
watching
this
tape
it
can
only
mean
one
thing
i'm
dead
and
our
noble
campaign
to
bring
order
to
the
town
of
sunnydale
has
failed
utterly
and
completely
but
on
the
other
hand
heck
maybe
we
won
and
right
now
i'm
on
some
jumbo
monitor
in
the
richard
wilkins
surrounded
by
a
bunch
of
kids
sitting
indian
style
and
looking
up
at
my
face
filled
with
fear
and
wonder
mayor
laughs
hi
kids
faith
smiles
but
the
realist
in
me
tends
to
doubt
it
now
faith
as
i
record
this
message
you're
sleeping
and
the
doctors
tell
me
you
might
never
wake
up
i
don't
believe
that
sooner
or
later
you
will
wake
up
and
when
you
do
you'll
find
the
world
has
gone
and
changed
on
you
i
wish
i
could
make
the
world
a
better
place
for
you
to
wake
up
in
but
tough
as
it
is
to
accept
we
both
have
to
understand
that
even
my
power
to
protect
and
watch
over
you
has
its
limits
see
the
hard
pill
to
swallow
is
that
once
i'm
gone
your
days
are
just
plain
numbered
now
i
know
you're
a
smart
and
capable
young
woman
in
charge
of
her
own
life
but
the
problem
faith
is
that
there
won't
be
a
place
in
the
world
for
you
anymore
by
now
i
bet
you're
feeling
very
much
alone
but
you're
never
alone
you'll
always
have
me
mayor
picks
up
box
and
you'll
always
have
this
go
ahead
open
the
box
mayor
faith
takes
box
from
the
case
and
looks
at
it
don't
worry
it's
not
gonna
bite
that's
my
job
mayor
laughs
go
ahead
open
it
faith
opens
the
box
surprise
you
won't
find
these
in
any
gumball
machine
see
when
you've
been
around
as
long
as
i
have
you
amke
friends
and
some
of
them
forge
