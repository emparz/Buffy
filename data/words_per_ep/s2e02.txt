sitting
on
top
of
the
gravestone
of
stephan
korshak
playing
with
her
yoyo
c'mon
stephan
rise
and
shine
some
of
us
have
a
ton
of
trig
homework
waiting
the
camera
cuts
to
her
right
and
approaches
her
from
behind
hey
buffy
inhales
a
quick
startled
breath
and
turns
around
to
face
her
stalker
is
this
a
bad
time
are
you
crazy
you
don't
just
sneak
up
on
people
in
a
graveyard
you
make
noise
when
you
walk
you
stomp
or
yodel
i
heard
you
were
on
the
hunt
i'm
supposed
to
be
but
lazy
bones
here
doesn't
wanna
come
out
and
play
when
you
first
wake
up
it's
a
little
disorienting
he'll
show
it's
weird
to
think
of
you
going
through
that
it's
weird
to
go
through
so
uh
you're
here
alone
yeah
why
i
just
thought
you'd
have
somebody
with
you
xander
or
someone
xander
or
someone
nope
buffy
hops
down
off
the
gravestone
why
are
you
jealous
angel
chuckles
of
xander
please
he's
just
a
kid
is
it
'cause
i
danced
with
him
'danced
with'
is
a
pretty
loose
term
'mated
with'
might
be
a
little
closer
don't
you
think
you're
being
a
little
unfair
it
was
one
little
dance
which
i
only
did
to
make
you
crazy
by
the
way
behold
my
success
i
am
not
jealous
you're
not
jealous
what
vampires
don't
get
jealous
stephan
has
come
out
of
the
ground
and
looks
at
them
from
behind
his
gravestone
see
whenever
we
fight
you
always
bring
up
the
vampire
thing
well
i
didn't
come
here
to
fight
the
vampire
lunges
at
her
and
knocks
her
into
angel
they
fall
to
the
ground
but
buffy
quickly
gets
up
oh
right
i
did
stephan
throws
a
few
punches
which
buffy
easily
blocks
she
punches
him
in
the
face
several
times
and
kicks
him
in
the
jaw
sending
him
stumbling
into
a
large
adjacent
gravestone
she
looks
around
frantically
where's
my
stake
ii
know
i
had
a
stake
i
didn't
see
a
stake
the
vampire
grabs
a
shovel
that
was
lying
by
the
other
gravestone
and
comes
at
them
again
angel
attacks
but
stephan
brings
the
shovel
up
and
hits
him
in
the
side
of
the
face
knocking
him
onto
his
back
he
leaves
angel
lying
there
and
steps
toward
buffy
she
meets
him
and
jumps
over
the
shovel
when
stephan
swings
it
at
her
legs
he
swings
it
at
her
again
but
she
catches
it
hits
him
again
and
breaks
the
handle
she
spins
around
with
her
half
and
jams
the
broken
handle
into
his
chest
he
falls
over
backward
and
bursts
into
ashes
as
he
hits
the
ground
angel
gets
upholding
the
side
of
his
head
buffy
out
of
breath
what
do
you
mean
he's
just
a
kid
does
that
mean
i'm
just
a
kid
too
look
obviously
i
made
a
mistake
coming
here
tonight
angel
turns
and
leaves
oh
no
you
don't
you
can't
just
turn
and
walk
away
from
me
like
that
buffy
starts
following
him
determinedly
it
takes
more
than
that
to
get
rid
of
me
she
falls
into
an
open
grave
with
an
open
and
empty
coffin
at
the
bottom
oof
uhhh
angel
comes
over
and
bends
down
to
look
you
okay
i'm
fine
buffy
sits
up
and
exhales
gee
i
wish
people
wouldn't
leave
open
graves
lying
around
like
this
buffy
stands
up
slowly
so
another
vampire
has
risen
tonight
she
pokes
her
head
out
of
the
grave
and
looks
across
the
grass
i
don't
think
so
look
at
those
tracks
whoever
was
buried
here
didn't
rise
from
this
grave
she
climbs
out
of
the
grave
and
finds
a
girl's
shoe
she
was
dragged
from
it
opening
credits

sunnydale
high
school
cut
to
the
library
buffy
and
xander
walk
in
and
see
giles
sitting
in
a
chair
and
talking
to
another
empty
chair
across
from
him
giles
clears
his
throat
wwwwhat
i'm
proposing
is
um
and
ii
don't
mean
to
appear
indecorous
is
is
um
a
aaa
social
engagement
um
a
a
a
aa
date
if
you're
amenable
buffy
and
xander
stop
and
listen
to
him
giles
is
displeased
with
himself
you
idiot
boy
giles
is
startled
and
quickly
gets
up
and
faces
them
i
guess
we
never
realized
how
much
you
like
that
chair
iii
was
just
working
on
giles
knocks
over
a
few
books
your
pickup
lines
giles
bends
down
um
in
a
manner
of
speaking
yes
giles
picks
up
the
books
then
if
you
wouldn't
mind
a
little
gene
and
roger
you
might
wanna
leave
off
the
'idiot'
part
being
called
an
idiot
tends
to
take
people
out
of
the
dating
mood
hmm
it
actually
kinda
turns
me
on
xander
looks
at
buffy
buffy
to
xander
i
fear
you
buffy
goes
to
the
table
you
also
might
wanna
avoid
words
like
'amenable'
and
'indecorous'
y'know
speak
english
not
whatever
they
speak
in
um
england
yeah
you
just
say
'hey
i
got
a
thing
you
maybe
have
a
thing
maybe
we
could
have
a
thing'
giles
buffy
sarcastically
oh
thank
you
cyrano
i'm
not
finished
then
you
say
'how
do
you
feel
about
mexican'
giles
about
mexicans
mexican
food
you
take
her
for
food
for
which
you
then
pay
buffy
sits
at
the
table
oh
right
so
this
chairwoman
we
are
talking
ms
calendar
right
wwhat
makes
you
think
that
xander
sits
simple
deduction
ms
calendar
is
reasonably
dollsome
especially
for
someone
in
your
age
bracket
she
already
knows
that
you're
a
school
librarian
so
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
how
to
break
that
embarrassing
news
to
her
and
she's
the
only
woman
we've
actually
ever
seen
speak
to
you
add
it
all
up
and
it
all
spells
'duh'
now
is
it
time
to
have
a
talk
about
the
facts
of
life
you
know
i'm
suddenly
deciding
this
is
none
of
your
business
giles
starts
up
the
stairs
y'know
because
that
whole
stork
thing
is
a
smoke
screen
giles
stops
and
looks
back
at
him
buffy
laughs
to
herself
so
um
how
did
things
go
last
night
did
mr
korshak
show
up
on
schedule
more
or
less
angel
and
i
took
care
of
him
angel
buffy
gives
xander
a
look
there's
something
else
though
we
found
an
empty
grave
another
vampire
no
no
this
one
was
dug
up
and
the
body
was
taken
out
grave
robbing
that's
new
interesting
giles
comes
back
down
to
the
table
i
know
you
meant
to
say
gross
and
disturbing
yes
yes
yes
of
course
uh
terrible
thing
must
must
put
a
stop
to
it
damn
it
so
why
does
someone
want
to
dig
up
graves
well
i'll
uh
collect
some
theories
uh
it
would
help
if
we
knew
who
the
body
belonged
to
meredith
todd
ring
a
bell
no
she
died
recently
she
was
our
age
drawin'
a
blank
why
don't
we
ask
willow
to
uh
fire
giles
indicates
the
pc
this
thing
up
and
uh
track
meredith
down
cut
to
the
halls
signups
for
the
science
fair
are
going
on
willow
is
writing
in
her
entry
eric
comes
up
to
her
with
a
camera
and
points
it
at
her
smile
eric
takes
her
picture
hey
he
turns
around
and
sees
another
girl
oh
look
at
those
legs
eric
goes
to
take
her
picture
no
thank
you
chris
comes
up
behind
willow
eric
will
you
knock
it
off
eric
looks
at
him
upset
to
have
his
fun
spoiled
willow
smiles
hey
chris
hey
he
picks
up
a
signup
sheet
she
watches
what
he's
writing
he
looks
up
at
her
oh
i
i
was
just
wondering
what
you
were
gonna
do
this
year
why
'cause
every
year
you
win
and
i
place
second
so
i
just
thought
i'd
see
what
i'm
up
against
you
know
what
the
key
is
if
dr
clark
doesn't
understand
your
experiment
he
gives
you
higher
marks
so
it
looks
like
he
understands
your
experiment
chris
reads
willow's
entry
'the
effects
of
subviolet
light
spectrum
deprivation
on
the
development
of
fruit
flies'
chris
smirks
that
should
do
the
trick
cordelia
shows
up
and
signs
up
okay
i'm
doing
this
under
protest
it
is
not
fair
that
they're
making
participation
in
this
year's
science
fair
mandatory
i
don't
think
anyone
should
have
to
do
anything
educational
in
school
if
they
don't
want
to
willow
reads
'the
tomato
fruit
or
vegetable'
i
wanted
to
do
something
i
could
finish
in
a
weekend
alright
eric
flashes
a
picture
of
cordelia
stop
it
what
are
you
doing
cordelia
eric
takes
another
picture
we
are
under
florescent
light

tip

cordelia
watches

eric
raises
his
eyebrows
at
her
cordelia
disgusted
uhhh
cordelia
leaves
cordelia's
so
fine
y'know
she'd
be
just
perfect
for
us
don't
be
an
idiot
she's
alive
cut
to
the
library
willow
sits
down
in
front
of
the
pc
this
shouldn't
take
long
i'm
probably
the
only
girl
in
school
who
has
the
coroner's
office
bookmarked
as
a
favorite
place
cordelia
coming
in
hi
sorry
to
interrupt
your
little
undead
playgroup
but
i
need
to
ask
willow
if
she'll
help
me
with
my
science
fair
project
it's
a
fruit
i
would've
asked
chris
to
help
me
but
then
that
would've
brought
back
too
many
memories
of
daryl
i
found
it
meredith
todd
died
in
a
car
accident
last
week
of
course
i
have
learned
to
deal
with
my
pain
how
was
her
neck
fine
except
for
being
broken
giles
comes
out
of
his
office
hello
can
we
deal
with
my
pain
please
there
there
he
pats
her
on
the
shoulder
and
continues
up
into
the
stacks
it
says
that
meredith
and
two
other
girls
in
the
car
were
killed
instantly
they
were
all
on
the
fondren
high
pep
squad
on
the
way
to
a
game
you
know
what
this
means
that
fondren
might
actually
beat
sunnydale
in
the
crosstown
body
count
competition
this
year
she
wasn't
killed
by
vampires
somebody
did
dig
up
her
corpse
eww
why
is
it
that
every
conversation
you
people
have
has
the
word
'corpse'
in
it
okay
so
we
got
a
body
snatcher
what
does
that
mean
uh
hhere's
what
i've
come
up
with
demons
who
eat
the
flesh
of
the
dead
to
absorb
their
souls
or
iiit
could
obviously
be
a
a
voodoo
practitioner
you
mean
making
a
zombie
uh
zombies
more
likely
for
most
traditional
purposes
a
voodoo
priest
would
require
more
than
one
so
we
should
see
if
the
other
girls
from
the
accident
are
awol
too
maybe
we
can
figure
out
what
this
creep
has
in
mind
if
we
know
whether
or
not
he's
dealing
in
volume
so
we
dig
up
some
graves
tonight
oh
boy
a
field
trip
are
you
gonna
call
angel
i
don't
think
so
yeah
why
bother
him
huh
angel
and
i
have
been
um
never
mind
as
far
as
angel's
concerned
i'm
taking
the
night
off
okay
so
we're
set
then
say
nineish
byo
shovel
and
i'll
pack
some
food
who
else
likes
those
little
powdered
doughnuts
me
cordelia
darn
i
have
cheerleader
practice
tonight
boy
i
wish
i
knew
we
were
gonna
be
digging
up
dead
people
sooner
i
would've
canceled
alright
but
if
you
come
across
the
army
of
zombies
can
you
page
us
before
they
eat
your
flesh
cordelia
huffs
and
leaves
the
library
xander
huh
zombies
don't
eat
the
flesh
of
the
living
yeah
i
knew
that
but
did
you
see
the
look
on
her
face
cut
to
the
cemetery
that
night
giles
and
xander
are
digging
while
buffy
and
willow
relax
and
watch
i
couldn't
believe
angel
he
was
acting
all
jealous
and
he
wouldn't
even
admit
it
jealous
of
what
of
xander
because
you
did
that
sexy
dance
with
him
am
i
ever
gonna
live
that
down
no
willow
munches
a
doughnut
anyway
he
was
being
totally
irrational
love
makes
you
do
the
wacky
that's
the
truth
y'know
this
might
go
a
lot
faster
if
you
femmes
actually
picked
up
a
shovel
too
here
here
sorry
but
i'm
an
oldfashioned
gal
i
was
raised
to
believe
that
men
dig
up
the
corpses
and
the
women
have
the
babies
buffy
to
willow
so
speaking
of
the
wacky
what
was
cordelia's
whole
riff
about
painful
memories
who's
daryl
daryl
epps
chris'
older
brother
he
was
a
big
football
star
allstate
two
years

a
running
uh
someone
who
runs
and
catches
was
he
studly
big
time
all
of
the
girls
were
crazy
for
him
and
he
broke
cordy's
heart
thus
possibly
proving
its
existence
he
died
rock
climbing
or
something
he
fell
man
that's
lousy
poor
chris
ever
since
then
chris
has
been
real
quiet
kind
of
in
his
own
world
i
heard
their
mother

the
house
anymore
i
think
we're
there
buffy
and
willow
get
up
and
go
over
to
the
grave
by
the
way
are
we
hoping
to
find
a
body
or
no
body
call
me
an
optimist
but
i'm
hoping
to
find
a
fortune
in
gold
doubloons
um
body
would
mean
flesheating
demon
no
body
would
point
towards
the
uh
army
of
zombies

pick
really

car
as
the
others

drive
off
before
cordelia
reaches
her
car
she
hears
something
by

be
heard
outside
in
the
hall
so
both
coffins
are
empty
that
makes
three
girls
signed
up
for
the
army
of
zombies
they
come
in
through
the
doors
is
it
an
army
if
you
just
have
three
angel
gets
up
from
the
table
and
faces
them
cordelia
clings
to
his
arm
and
gets
up
too
zombie
drill
team
then
you're
back
angel
xander
angel
angel
to
buffy
i
thought
you
were
takin'
the
night
off
i
i
was
um
but
something
came
up
cordelia
told
me
the
truth
xander
chuckles
that's
gotta
be
a
first
um
as
long
as
you're
here
perhaps
you
could
be
of
some
help
hmm
giles
to
buffy
hmm
we
were
investigating
somebody's
been
digging
up
the
bodies
of
dead
girls
i
know
we
found
some
of
them
you
mean
like
two
of
the
three
i
mean
like
some
of
them
like
parts
it
was
horrible
angel
saved
me
from
an
arm
god
there
were
so
many
parts
they
were
everywhere
why
are
these
terrible
things
always
happening
to
me
karma
xander
coughs
to
cover
it
so
much
for
our
zombie
theory
so
much
for
all
our
theories
i
don't
get
it
why
go
to
all
the
trouble
to
dig
up
three
girls
only
to
chop
them
up
and
throw
them
away
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
especially
from
a
time
management
standpoint
well
what
i
saw
didn't
add
up
to
three
whole
girls
i
think
they
kept
some
parts
could
this
get
yuckier
they
probably
kept
the
other
parts
to
eat
question
answered
why
dispose
of
the
remains
five
miles
from
the
cemetery
at
a
school
of
all
places
maybe
because
whoever
did
it
had
some
business
in
the
neighborhood
like
say
classes
oh
ah
this
was
no
hatchet
job
whoever
made
those
incisions
really
knew
what
they
were
doing
giles
disbelieving
yes
really
what
student
here
is
gonna
be
that
well
versed
in
physiology
well
i
can
think
of
five
or
six
guys
in
the
science
club
and
me
so
will
come
clean
promise
to
never
do
it
again
and
we'll
call
it
a
night
xander
no
response
he
joked
xander
smiles
willow
why
don't
you
get
these
guys'
locker
numbers
so
we
can
do
some
checking
no
i
have
to
go
home
now
i
have
to
take
a
bath
and
burn
my
clothes
xander
in
mock
disappointment
you
have
to
go
aw
too
bad
keep
in
touch
buhbye
i
don't
wanna
go
alone
i'm
still
fragile
cordelia
to
angel
can
you
take
me
angel
is
in
openmouthed
shock
and
looks
at
buffy
she
gives
him
a
stare
of
disapproval
great
i'll
drive
she
leads
the
way
out
of
the
library
as
angel
gives
buffy
another
helpless
look
how
about
that
i
always
pegged
him
as
a
onewoman
vampire
cut
to
chris'
house
his
mother
is
sitting
in
front
of
the
tv
watching
videos
of
daryl's
games
his
trophy
sits
on
top
of
the
tv
chris
comes
out
of
the
basement
i'm
going
out
mom
she
doesn't
even
look
up
she
just
blows
out
another
lungful
of
cigarette
smoke
chris
walks
over
to
the
front
door
i'll
be
back
later
okay
mom
still
no
response
she
takes
another
drag
from
her
cigarette
chris
lets
out
a
sigh
of
frustration
and
leaves
the
house
on
the
video
daryl
just
scored
a
touchdown
and
the
team
is
holding
him
up
high
as
the
cheerleaders
jump
and
wave
their
pompoms
daryl
daryl
daryl
daryl
daryl
daryl
takes
his
helmet
off
and
holds
his
fists
up
in
the
air
laughing
and
enjoying
the
moment
cut
to
the
halls
at
school
xander
is
working
a
locker
combination
from
a
list
giles
comes
down
the
other
hall
you
understand
in
my
capacity
as
school
official
this
search
is
completely
unauthorized
and
i
i
cannot
condone
it
fine
your
butt's
covered
wanna
grab
a
locker
buffy
hands
him
a
sheet
uh
yes
yes
of
course
giles
takes
the
sheet
buffy
approaches
a
locker
okay
eric
let's
see
what's
on
your
annoying
little
mind
willow
at
another
locker
nothing
in
here
but
back
issues
of
scientific
american
ooo
i
haven't
read
this
one
willow
starts
to
read
nothing
remarkable
here
xander
opens
one
guys
they
all
go
over
to
see
your
friend
chris
epps'
locker
willow
reads
off
book
titles
'grey's
anatomy'
'mortician's
desk
reference'
'robicheaux's
guide
to
muscles
and
tendons'
giles
reaches
in
and
pulls
out
a
newspaper
folded
open
to
a
picture
of
the
three
cheerleaders
the
title
above
the
picture
reads
'tragic
accident
kills
three'
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
chris
is
involved
he's
into
corpses
alright
but
we
still
don't
know
why
yes
we
do
she
opens
eric's
locker
door
and
shows
them
a
collage
of
a
woman
made
from
parts
of
various
pictures
cut
to
chris'
basement
eric
sings
while
chris
works
on
a
body
i
guess
you'll
say
what
can
make
me
feel
this
way
my
girl
talkin'
'bout
my
girl
my
girl
how's
my
baby
she's
not
your
baby
she's
not
gonna
be
anybody's
baby
if
we
don't
finish
her
soon
i'm
working
on
it
so
am
i
friend
so
am
i
he
hangs
up
freshly
developed
pictures
of
buffy
willow
and
cordelia
to
dry
cut
to
the
balcony
buffy
comes
up
to
willow
and
xander
sitting
on
the
railing
any
sign
of
our
suspects
not
yet
i
don't
get
it
why
would
anybody
wanna
make
a
girl
you
mean
when
there's
so
many
premade
ones
just
lying
around
the
things
we
do
for
love
love
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
maybe
not
but
i'll
tell
you
this
people
don't
fall
in
love
with
what's
right
in
front
of
them
willow
gives
buffy
a
sad
knowing
look
people
want
the
dream
what
they
can't
have
willow
looks
over
at
xander
longingly
buffy
understands
only
too
well
the
more
unattainable
the
more
attractive
willow
hops
down
from
her
perch
and
for
eric
the
unattainable
would
include
everyone
that's
alive
she
walks
around
xander
to
head
down
the
stairs
buffy
joins
her
uh
eric's
sick
enough
to
do
something
like
this
but
what
about
chris
he
seems
like
a
human
person
xander
follows
them
i
dunno
that
thing
with
his
brother
was
really
hard
on
him
and
he
talked
about
death
a
lot
maybe
he
just
wanted
to
get
oneup
on
it
but
it's
not
doable
i
mean
making
someone
from
scraps
actually
making
them
live
if
it
is
my
science
project's
definitely
coming
in
second
this
year
xander

jenny
smiles
and
goes
back
into
her
classroom
giles
to
himself
that
went
well
i
think
cut
to
the
science
classroom
willow
is
looking
through
a
book
i
still
don't
get
how
chris
could
do
it
i
mean
arresting
the
cell
deterioration
is
one
thing
but
hello
xander
holds
up
a
visible
head
i
wanna
get
ahead
willow
exhales
maybe
an
electrical
current
combined
with
an
adrenaline
boost
for
the
love
of
god
can
somebody
scratch
my
nose
buffy
comes
into
the
room
well
it's
official
chris
and
eric
didn't
come
to
school
today
that's
no
coincidence
maybe
they
finished
their
project
god
what
if
it
worked
what
what
if
that
poor
girl
is
walking
around
poor
girls
technically
what
could
she
be
thinking
and
what
are
they
gonna
do
with
her
giles
comes
in
also
i
don't
think
we
need
to
worry
about
that
just
yet
i
spoke
to
a
press
person
this
morning
about
the
remains
the
police
have
finished
sorting
through
them
and
apparently
they
found
three
heads
in
the
dumpster
they
only
had
three
girls
precisely
so
they
don't
have
the
whole
uh
package
heads
must
be
no
good
huh
i
found
'em
attractive
enough
xander
gets
looks
from
the
girls
well
obviously
i'm
not
as
sick
as
chris
and
eric
based
on
what
the
police
have
put
together
i
would
say
they're
one
step
short
of
completing
their
masterpiece
one
step
the
camera
pans
around
the
visible
head
cut
to
chris'
basement
we're
running
out
of
time
if
we
wait
too
long
the
onset
of
atrophy
in
the
limbs
will
be
irreversible
we
can
turn
up
the
current
that'll
buy
us
a
day
at
least
we
will
lose
the
entire
body
if
we
don't
attach
a
head
soon
we
have
time
we
don't
the
crash
with
the
girls
was
lucky
but
we
can't
just
keep
waiting
around
for
another
lucky
accident
to
drop
a
head
in
our
laps
you
know
what
we
have
to
do
hell
it's
just
one
lousy
girl
i
won't
do
it
i
i
can't
kill
anyone
chris
turns
to
the
shadows
please
understand
i
i
can't
do
that
please
don't
make
me
but
you
gave
me
your
word
you
promised
me
little
brother
daryl
comes
into
the
light
that
i
wouldn't
be
alone
his
face
is
discolored
and
crisscrossed
with
stitches
part

chris'
basement
the
body
is
perfect
and
if
we
harvest
a
head
tonight

be
ready

you
brought
me
back
you
promised
you'd
take
care
of
me
i
need
this
chris
i
need
someone
please
don't
ask
me
to
do
this

ask
me
to
take
a
life
i
tried
to
tell
him
if
you
take
a
life
in
order
to
make
a
life
the
whole
thing
is
a
wash
no
harm
no
foul
maybe
you
could
you
could
go
out
no
let
people
know
they
can't
see
me
chris
you've
always
been
smarter
than
me
you
were
always
the
brains
you're
the
only
one
who

eric

talkin'
'bout

my

he
snips
her
head
off
cut
to
the
library
i
checked
the
obits
nothing
that
would
make
for
a
likely
candidate
they
seem
kinda
picky
for
guys
who
had
three
heads
to
begin
with
formaldehyde
formaldehyde
yes
yes
yes
yes
of
course
it
accelerates
neural
decay
in
the
brain
cells
after
a
couple
days
they're
useless
they're
gonna
need
something
really
fresh
how
fresh
as
fresh
as
possible
buffy
you
don't
think
that
they
would
i
think
anybody
who
cuts
dead
girls
into
little
pieces
does
not
get
the
benefit
of
any
doubt
i
wanna
end
this
thing
now
i
second
that
okay

and
opens

she
quietly
makes
her
way
down

stairs
she
looks
around

bit
and

over
to
the

she
finds

whispers
cordelia
daryl
sneaks
up

daryl

by
the
shirt
nothing's
changed
we
can
still
do
this
you
and
me
your
brother's
not
the
only
one
who
can
create
life
whadaya
say
daryl
sets
him
down
eric
takes
a
few
deep
breaths
let's
go
scare
you
up
a
date
part
4

chris'
basement
buffy
and
chris
come
in
and
quickly
descend
the
stairs
daryl
daryl
daryl
she
takes
a
quick
look
around
he's
not
here
where
else
could
he
be
but
he
would
never
go
out
uunless
he's
gonna
pick
up
where
you
left
off
she
makes
quick
strides
to
get
out
of
the
basement
and
over
to
the
game
after
a
moment's
hesitation
chris
follows
her
cut
to
the
game
cordelia
is
doing
a
cheer
with
the
squad
go
razorbacks
go
go
team
go
go
razorbacks
go
go
team
go
on
the
field
the
ball
is
snapped
thrown
caught
and
run
in
for
a
touchdown
the
crowd
goes
wild
cut
to
jenny
and
giles
coming
from
the
refreshment
stand
his
arms
are
full
of
snacks
and
drinks
i
don't
know
what
it
is
about
football
that
does
it
for
me
i
mean
it
lacks
the
the
grace
of
basketball
the
uh
poetry
of
baseball
at
its
best
it's
unadorned
aggression
it's
such
a
rugged
contest
rugged
american
football
giles
laughs
they
climb
into
the
stands
and
that's
funny
because
no
giles
laughs
i
just
think
it's
rather
odd
giles
they
sit
that
a
nation
that
prides
itself
on
its
virility
should
feel
compelled
to
strap
on
forty
pounds
of
protective
gear
just
in
order
to
play
rugby
is
this
your
normal
strategy
for
a
first
date
dissing
my
country's
national
pastime
did
you
just
say
'date'
you
noticed
that
huh
hi
ms
calendar
hi
giles
hey
guys
what's
up
eric's
was
a
bust
nothing
there
yeah
nothing
but
a
bunch
of
computer
equipment
and
a
pornography
collection
so
prodigious
it
even
scared
me
did
buffy
get
back
yet
no
uh
no
uh
perhaps
you
should
uh
circulate
nearer
the
field
see
what
you
can
find
willow
and
xander
slip
under
the
railing
and
sit
in
front
of
giles
and
jenny
xander
reaches
back
and
takes
giles'
popcorn
so
what's
the
score
giles
and
jenny
are
unhappy
about
them
sitting
right
there
cut
to
a
view
of
the
field
from
behind
the
spectators
the
teams
are
getting
in
position
for
the
next
play
the
ball
is
snapped
cut
under
the
stands
daryl
is
crawling
along
looking
for
cordelia
he
sees
the
action
on
the
field
and
stops
a
moment
to
watch
and
remember
a
player
on
the
field
gets
tackled
but
has
gained
several
yards
and
gets
high
fives
from
his
teammates
daryl
lowers
his
eyes
a
moment
then
notices
cordelia
she
takes
a
break
from
cheerleading
and
walks
over
to
the
coolers
next
to
the
bleachers
for
a
drink
daryl
comes
up
behind
her
as
she
drinks
and
grabs
her
she
screams
but
her
yell
is
drowned
out
by
the
crowd
cheering
another
touchdown
the
other
cheerleaders
jump
and
wave
their
pompoms
on
the
field
the
players
help
the
scoring
team
member
up
and
pat
him
on
the
back

an
abandoned

cordelia

an
even
higher
pitch
eric
holds
up
a
pan
and
threatens
to
hit
her
with
it

for

shows
up
i

okay
cut
to
giles
walking
up
to
jenny
he
hands
her
a
cup
of
coffee
sorry
about
all
this
it's
okay
although
a
good
rule
of
thumb
for
a
first
date
is
don't
do
anything
so
exciting
that
it'll
be
hard
to
top
on
the
second
date
believe
it
or
not
since
i've
moved
here
to
live
on
top
of
the
hellmouth
the
events
of
this
evening
actually
qualify
as
a
slow
night
giles
pauses
and
considers
did
you
just
say
'second
date'
you
noticed
that
huh
jenny
smiles
giles
smiles
back
and
takes
a
sip
of
his
coffee
cut
to
willow
and
xander
well
i
guess
that
makes
it
official
everybody's
paired
off
vampires
get
dates
hell
even
the
school
librarian
sees
more
action
than
me
you
ever
think
that
the
world
is
a
giant
game
of
musical
chairs
and
the
music's
stopped
and
we're
the
only
ones
who
don't
have
a
chair
all
the
time
xander
i
just
wanted
to
thank
you
for
saving
my
life
what
you
did
in
there
was
really
brave
and
heroic
and
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
if
there
was
anything
that
i
could
ever
do
to
do
you
mind
we're
talking
here
cordelia
is
taken
aback
rolls
her
eyes
and
leaves
so
where
were
we
wondering
why
we
never
get
dates
yeah
so
why
do
you
think
that
is
cut
to
the
cemetery
angel
and
buffy
are
strolling
through
god
the
whole
thing
was
so
creepy
well
at
the
same
time
i
mean
he
did
do
it
all
for
his
brother
sounds
like
he
took
it
a
little
over
the
edge
love
makes
you
do
the
wacky
what
crazy
stuff
oh
crazy
like
a
twohundredandfortyoneyearold
being
jealous
of
a
high
school
junior
are
you
fessing
up
i've
thought
about
it
maybe
it
bothers
me
a
little
i
don't
love
xander
yeah
but
he's
in
your
life
he
gets
to
be
there
when
i
can't
take
your
classes
eat
your
meals
hear
your
jokes
and
complaints
he
gets
to
see
you
in
the
sunlight
i
don't
look
that
good
in
direct
light
it'll
be
morning
soon
i
should
probably
go
i
could
walk
you
home
they
look
at
each
