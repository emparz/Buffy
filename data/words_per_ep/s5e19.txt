two
doctors
who
are
standing
there
looking
at
a
clipboard
one
wears
a
white
lab
coat
the
other
blue
scrubs
they

be
waiting
for
ben
benjamin

a
pleasant
surprise
i'm
sorry
i'm
late
you're
not
late
ben

at
his
watch
but
sir
you

be
late
to
a
job
that
you
don't
have
doctor
gives
the
clipboard
to
the
other
doctor
who

away
interestingly
enough
i've
decided
to
give
your
job
to
someone
who'll
actually
do
it
doctor
ben
sighs
in
annoyance
honest
to
god
ben
i've
been
calling
you
for
two
weeks
where
the
hell
have
you
been
i
didn't
wanna
i'm
sorry

an
explanation
for
this
which
i
can't
exactly
give
you
i
can
i
just
tell
you
it's
not
my
fault
doctor
nods
sure
you
can
also
tell
me
that
the
dog
ate
your
homework
or
maybe
eating
twinkies
made
you
do
it
or
maybe
yeah
that
there's
really
a
wicked
demonic
creature
living
inside
you
that
takes
control
of
your
body
and
forces
you
to
do
its
bidding
doctor
sighs
take
responsibility
for
your
actions
ben
i
this

ben
angrily
you
know
forget
it
just
forget
it
he
turns
to
walk
away
fastcut
to
ben
cleaning
out
his
locker
angrily
throwing
clothes
into
a
bag
while
talking
to
himself
this
is
so
unfair
you're
taking
everything
away
from
me
everything
i
worked
for
i
earned
i
care
about
these
are
my
choices
this
is
my
life
and
you're
ruining
it
ben
pauses
shakes
his
head

not
here
not
now
please
ben
puts
his
hands
to
his
face
i'm
ben
i'm
ben
i'm
ben
he
continues
to
repeat
this
phrase
while
turning
to
bang
his
hand
against
the
side
of
the
locker
focus
on
his
hand
as
it
shrinks
and
becomes
glory's
hand
pan
over
to
glory
standing
where
ben
was
she
looks
around
with
a
small
smile
i'm
hungry
wolf
howl
opening
credits
act
i

open
on
glory
taking
a
bubble
bath
beside
the
bathtub
three
of
her
demons
are
kneeling
with
blindfolds
over
their
eyes
one
holds
a
tray
with
a
wine
glass
on
it
another
holds
a
large
box
of
chocolate
glory
happy
sigh
we
got
this
part
right
that's
for
sure
lot
of
sucky
things
in
this
dimension
bubble
baths
not
one
of
'em
glory
blows
some
bubbles
know
what
i
mean
i
am
in
thunderous
agreement
oh
glittering
glistening
glorificus
i
wasn't
talking
to
you
uh
begging
your
pardon
and
begging
in
general
but
were
you
talking
to
me
eww
yeah
right
like
any
of
you
have
ever
bathed
anyway
oh
but
we
do
your
scrumptiousness
we
bathe
in
your
splendiforous
radiance
your
aromatic
how
about
you
shut
up
and
listen
to
me
you
disgusting
little
fools
glory
all
three
bow
their
heads
okay
now
i
asked
for
the
key
and
you
brought
me
a
vampire
a
pulseless
impure
folliclyfried
vampire
loofah
murk
produces
a
large
loofah
and
gives
it
to
her
she
begins
scrubbing
her
leg
so
what
i
think
we
have
here
is
a
failure
for
you
to
do
your
frickin'
jobs
pardon
my
french
glory
shoves
the
loofah
back
into
murk's
hand
mimosa
slook
holds
out
the
tray
and
glory
takes
the
glass
mmm

glory
sips
smiles
vitamins
glory
briskly
so
i
think
you
better
rack
your
little
minion
brains
and
tell
me
everything
that
you
saw
when
you
were
spying
on
buffy
and
her
wacky
pals
everything
mm
then
i'll
figure
out
who
the
key
is
you
lied
to
me
cut
to
headshot
of
dawn
sitting
in
a
chair
didn't
lie
eexactly
buffy
os
really
cut
to
headshot
of
buffy
sitting
next
to
her
what
about
all
the
times
i
asked
you
how
school
was
and
you
said
fine
well
it
was
dawn
softly
you
didn't
ask
if
i
was
in
it
when
it
was
fine
we
see
a
woman
sitting
behind
a
desk
with
a
nameplate
saying
principal
stevens
buffy
and
dawn
sit
in
chairs
on
the
other
side
of
the
desk
buffy
sighs
ii
don't
know
what
to
say
ii'm
sure
you're
aware
that
the
past
few
months
you
know
have
been
kind
of
hard
for
dawn
not
that
i'm
saying
that's
an
excuse
i
understand
your
mother
was
a
lovely
woman
and
we'll
all
miss
her
very
much
i
know
how
difficult
it
must
be
it
is
especially
for
dawn
sheshe's
just
a
kid

i
think
we

know
that
dawn
is
a
lot
more
than
just
a
kid
dawn
looks
alarmed
looks
over
at
buffy
who
returns
the
look
principal
leans
forward
she's
a
talented
young
girl
with
a
sharp
mind

principal
to
dawn
when
she
puts
the
effort
in
dawn
looks
away
in
relief
look
i
realize
that
there's
been
some
balldropping
but
i'm
sure
this
will
all
dawn
why
don't
you
wait
outside
for
a
few
minutes
dawn
looks
very
scared
she
looks
over
at
buffy
who
gives
her
a
nod
dawn
gets
up
and
leaves
buffy
watches
her
go
with
a
sigh
the
principal
gives
buffy
a
stern
look

she's
reading
something

in
the
background
there's
an
older
couple
walking
around
browsing
the
camera
pans
around
to
reveal
anya
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
standing
watching
the
customers

partly
hidden
behind
a
display

around
to
face
him
old
saying
a
watched
customer
never
buys
they
would
if
they
were
patriotic
xander
and
willow

put
down
their
reading

other
xander

us
embracing
the
extraordinarily
precious
ideology
that's
helped
to
shape

democracy
capitalism
the
free
market
depends
on
the
profitable
exchange
of
goods
for
currency
anya
xander
and
willow
exchange
an
amused
look
it's
a
system
of
symbiotic
beauty
apparently
lost
on
these
old
people

to
look
back
at
the
customers
look
at
'em
perusing
the

balanced
breakfast
hospital
corners

a
new
beginning
cut
to
the
main
room
as
buffy
and
giles
emerge
discipline
authority
order
we
hear
giggling
buffy
looks
into
the
main
room
and

and
willow
lying
on
the
floor
headtotoe
forming
a
triangle

stands
in
the
middle
all

giggling

not
giles
xander
and
anya
move
away
into
the
shop
we
were
acting
out
a
geometry
problem
'cause
i
read
this
really
neat
article
that
said
kids
learn
math
better
if
you
you
stimulate
their
uh
visual
learning
pattern
you
know
using
the
right
side
of
the
brain
instead
of
just
the
left
buffy
still
looks
stern
and
unamused
willow
os
stuff
like
that
uhhuh
so
we
made
a
triangle
with
our
bodies
and
that's
when
i
called
xander
obtuse
and
he
got
really
grumpy
willow
smiling
dawn
giggles
and
then
dawn
said
we
were
acute
triangle
and
well
hilarity
ensued
right
well
you
know
what
i
think
i
think
maybe
dawn
should
do
her
homework
at
home

willow
and
dawn
stop
smiling
look
disappointed
bbut
it
was
working
i
was

scowls
looks
at
willow
fine

listen
to
me
dawn
goes
to
get
her
stuff
willow
walking
over
to
buffy
please
don't
be
grouchy
with
her
who
among
us
can
resist
the
allure
of
really
funny
math
puns
it's
really
important
that
dawn
finishes
her
schoolwork
right
now
shot
of
dawn
listening
to
them
from
the
table
willow
os
yeah
i
know
but
dawn
turns
back
to
her
stuff
as
willow
glances
at
her
we
were
having
good
clean
educational
fun
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
was
all
gloom
and
doom
and
the
outlawing
of
human
triangles
buffy
firmly
it's
really
important
that
dawn
finishes
her
schoolwork
right
now
i
know
it
is
and
i'm
a
big
fan
of
school
you
know
me
i'm
like
willow
sings

school
it's
your
birthday
or
something
to
that
effect
look
willow
i
know
that
you
mean
well
but
you
just
don't
understand
and
there's
no
way
that
you
could
i
do
so
understand
it
you're

buffy
walks
over
to
the
table
where
dawn
stands
holding
her
stuff
buffy
picks
up
her
bag
without
breaking
her
stride
ready
dawn
looks
sullen
turns
and
falls
into
step
behind
buffy
she
casts
a
look
over
her
shoulder
at
willow
as
they
leave
cut
to
close
shot
of
glory
in
her
apartment
so
it's
her
under
our
noses
all
this
time
i
like
the
detail
work
those
monks
did
glory
smiling
quirks
foibles
passions
it's
all
so
cute
so
human
you
know
we
see
that
she's
sitting
on
the
sofa
with
the
three
monks
standing
before
her
they
all
nod
and
smile
pretty
convincing
really
glory
ponders
but
not
convincing
enough
she
slowly
stands
up
and
looks
each
demon
in
the
eye
you
all
know
your
assignments
glory
smiles
widely
i
think
it's
time
to
collect
the
key
she
whirls
around
and
begins
to
walk
out
the
monks
follow
her
in
singlefile
blackout
act
ii

open
on
willow
and
tara's
dorm
room
tara
is
looking
in
the
closet
for
clothing
while
willow
sits
on
the
bed
putting
on
her
shoes
it
wasn't
anything
really
buffy
was
just
a
little
crabby
at
dawn
about
her
schoolwork
well
it's
understandable
tara
puts
something
on
the
bed
turns
back
to
close
the
closet
door
yeah
sure
it
is
i'd
totally
be
blowing
off
classes
if
i
were
in
dawnie's
shoes
tara
smiles

wouldn't
blow
off
a
class
if
your
head
was
on
fire
tara
goes
over
to
the
sink
and
i
meant
buffy
willow
putting
on
earrings
buffy
what
understandable
about
the
crabby
she
has
to
look
after
dawn
now
willow
putting
on
a
jacket
yeah
but
not
in
a
miss
minchin's
select
seminary
for
girls

i
mean
she's
just
gonna
make
dawnie
more
rebellious
i
had
to
deal
with
my
brother's
problems
after
i
mean
you
can't
really
know
what
it's
like
to

know
that
tara
makes
a
noise
of
displeasure
frowns
sits
on
the
bed
next
to
willow
i
i
didn't
mean
to
no
i
just
i
i

and
in
public

i
was
snippy
gal
it's
just
i
know
i
can't
on
some
level

willow
sighs
it's
like
my
opinion
isn't
worth
anything
because
i
haven't
been
through

willow
sighs
i
didn't
lose
my
mom
so
i
don't
know
well
ii'm
not
the
expert
i
mean
i've
only
lost
the
one
willow
gives
a
sympathetic
smile
tara
looks
anxious
tara
uncertainly
do
i
act
like
the
big
knowledge
woman
wide
shot
of
the
two
of
them
sitting
on
the
bed
facing
each
other
with
at
least
a
foot
separating
them
willow
weakly
no
is
that
no
spelled
yes
sort
of
willow
tara
frowns
i
mean
i
just
feel
like
thethe
junior
partner
you've
been
doing
everything
longer
than
me
you've
been
out
longer
you've
been
practicing
witchcraft
way
longer
oh
but
you're
way
beyond
me
there
in
just
a
few
i
mean
it
frightens
me
how
powerful
you're
getting
willow
frowns
that's
a
weird
word
tara
nervous
smile
getting
it
frightens
you
i
frighten
you
tara
jumps
up
from
the
bed
that
is
so
not
what
i
meant
i
meant
iimpresses
impressive
well
i
took
psych
101
i
mean
i
took
it
from
an
evil
government
scientist
who
was
skewered
by
her
frankensteinlike
creation
before
the
final
but
i
know
what
a
freudian
slip
is
tara
looks
upset
ddon't
you
trust
me
with
my
life
that's
not
what
i
mean
can't
we
just
go
to
the
fair
i
don't
feel
real
multicultural
right
now
willow
stands
up
wh
what
is
it
about
me
that
you
don't
trust
it's
not
that
i
worry
sometimes
you're
you're
changing
so
much
so
fast
i
don't
know
where
you're
heading
where
i'm
heading
i'm
saying
everything
wrong
no
i
think
you're
being
pretty
clear
this
isn't
about
the
witchcraft
it's
about
the
other
changes
in
my
life
i
trust
you
i
just

tara
looks
down
i
don't
know
where
i'm
gonna
fit
in
in
your
life
when
when
i
change
back
yeah
this
is
a
college
thing
just
a
a
little
experimentation
before
i
get
over
the
thrill
and
head
back
to
boys'
town
pause
you
think
that
should
i
i'm
really
sorry
that
i
didn't
establish
my
lesbo
street
cred
before
i
got
into
this
relationship
you're
the
only
woman
i've
ever
fallen
in
love
with
so
how
on
earth
could
you
ever
take
me
seriously
she
walks
toward
the
door
willow
please
have
fun
at
the
fair
willow
storms
out
tara
stands
there
looking
upset
cut
to
exterior
summers
house
day
a
couple
of
glory's
demons
walk
up
the
front
porch
over
to
the
side
window
kneel
down
and
look
in
the
window
inside
we
see
the
living
room
dawn
is
sitting
at
the
table
while
buffy
stands
the
camera
moves
in
through
the
window
buffy
is
folding
dish
towels
on
the
table
while
dawn
is
doing
homework
okay
so
ii
think
the
next
step
is
to
make
a
chart
a
schedule
buffy
dawn
gives
her
an
angry
look
i'll
write
down
all
the
things
you're
supposed
to
do
and
when
you
have
to
do
them
and
then
i'll
leave
a
box
next
to
it
which
you
can
mark
with
an
x
when
you've
accomplished
the
task
dawn
stares
at
her
with
a
sullen
expression
what
you
want
gold
stars
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
okay
you
can
have
gold
stars
i
don't
want
gold
stars
dawn
scoffs
i
don't
want
any
of
this
she
puts
down
her
pencil
and
crosses
her
arms
buffy
pauses
in
her
towelfolding
i'm
just
trying
to
give
you
a
normal
life
dawn
sarcastic
well
good
luck
dawn
returns
to
her
schoolwork
buffy
stands
and
stares
at
her
dawn
pauses
looks
up
warily
what
dawn
rolls
eyes
sits
back
what
am
i
doing
wrong
now
this
is
for
real
dawn
no

not
real
so
why
would
my
exciting
graph
of
chores
be
real
who
cares
if
a
key
gets
an
education
anyway
dawn
slams
her
textbook
shut
folds
her
arms
again
it's
a
chart
not
a
graph
and
you
are
real
yeah
those
monks
put
grades
k
through
eight
in
my
head
can't
we
just
wait
and
see
if
they
drop
nine
in
there
too
buffy
slams
her
hand
down
on
the
table
making
dawn
jump
and
wince
damn
it
dawn
this
is
serious
why
why
should
i
care
about
any
of
this
because
they'll
take
you
away

long
shot
of
the
two
of
them
facing
off
across
the
table
dawn
unfolds
her
arms
and
looks
scared
take
me
away
what
do
you
mean
buffy
softly
they'll
take
you
away
from
me
that's
what
your
principal
told
me
when
you
weren't
in
the
room
if
i
can't
make
you
go
to
school
then
i
won't
be
found
fit
to
be
your
legal
guardian
she
resumes
folding
towels
dawn
absorbs
this
for
a
moment
where
would
i
go
buffy
softly
i
don't
know
dad
maybe
or
foster
care
i
i
didn't
really
want
to
ask
dawn

could've
told
me
that
i
just
did

tara
winces
in
pain
aah

sound
tara
gasps
and
whimpers
as
glory
looks
around
at
the
other
fair
attendees
the
people
walk
around
not
seeming
to
notice
anything
nah
they
won't
help
you
i'd

tara
looks
around
desperately
shot
of
three
bicycle
cops
riding
away
overhead
shot
of
the
fair
there's
no
one
here
that
can
stop
me

shot
of
a
random
couple
i'll

her
and
her
glory
laughs
and
it'll
all
be
your
fault
shot
of
their
hands
glory's
nails
dig
in
and
tara's
blood
begins
to
drip
out
between
their
fingers
tara
continues
whimpering
softly
in
pain
and
breathing
erratically
kinda
funny
isn't
it
all
these
people
here
and
no
one
who
can
do
a
thing
not
a
person
who
can
help
you
tara
whimpers
and
turns
her
head
to
look
at
glory
but
that's
people
for
ya
they're
pretty
worthless
glory
watches
some
people
go
by
but
keys
on
the
other
hand
keys
are
worth
a
very
lot
glory
smiles
and
brings
their
clenched
hands
up
to
lick
off
some
of
the
blood
then
she
makes
a
disgusted
face
and
spits
you
lying
little
tramp
you're
not
the
key
you're
nothing
just
another
worthless
human
being
i
didn't
i
hate
being
lied
to
it
makes
me
feel
so
betrayed
glory
considers
hey
glory
turns
back
to
tara
you
wanna
make
it
all
better
tara
looks
at
her
with
fear
if
you
tell
me
who
the
key
really
is
i'll
let
you
go
tara
looks
alarmed
glory
gives
her
hand
another
squeeze
and
she
whimpers
again
as
we
hear
more
bones
crack
think
about
it
you
think
your
hand
hurts
imagine
what
you'd
feel
with
my
fingers
wiggling
in
your
brain
glory
tara
looks
very
scared
it
doesn't
kill
you
what
it
does
is
make
you
feel
like
you're
in
a
noisy
little
dark
room

glory
glory
frowns
and
fidgets
uncomfortably
naked
and
ashamed
and
there
are
things
in
the
dark
that
need
to
hurt
you
because
you're
bad
little
pinching
things
that
go
in
your
ears

glory
tara
begins
to
cry
and
crawl
on
the
inside
of
your
skull
and
you
know
that
if
the
noise
and
the
crawling
would
stop
that
you
could
remember
how
to
get
out
glory
contemplates
this
as
tara
continues
to
cry
quietly
then
glory
turns
to
look
at
tara
again
but
you
never
ever
will
glory
squeezes
her
hand
again
and
tara
gives
another
cry
of
pain
who
is
the
key
tara
forces
herself
to
stop
crying
and
look
glory
in
the
eye
saying
nothing
fine
let's
get
crazy
glory
caresses
the
side
of
tara's
face
with
her
other
hand
tara
whimpers
and
tries
to
pull
her
face
away
blackout

bursts
in
at

runs
straight
to
the
stairs
that

up
to
the
loft
where
the
more
dangerous
stuff
is
kept
she
goes
up
the

leather
back
from

of
a
bookshelf

and
begins
pulling

takes
out
a
jeweled
dagger

puts
them
in

shoves
books
off

glory

is
blown
back
by
an
unseen
wind
kali
hera
kronos
tonic
she
floats
into
the
room
toward
glory
as
the
minions
flee

like
nectar
thick
as

that
her
eyes
are
completely
black
cassiel
by
your
second
star
uhh

i
owe
you
pain
blue
lightning
flashes
out
of
willow's
hands
toward
glory
glory
screams
and
clutches
her
shoulders
cut

sitting
together
in

a
little
ways
off

dawn's
hair
back

your
fault
dawn
teary
how's
willow
buffy
continues
stroking
dawn's
hair
she
was
looking
to
go
all
paybacky
on
glory
for
a
minute
but
i
cooled
her
down
a
little
actually
a
lot
so
she's
not
gonna
do
anything
rash
then
no
i
explained
that
there
was
no
point
spike
walks
a
little
closer
mmhmm

a
powerful
and
mightily
pissedoff
witch
was
plannin'
on
going
and
spillin'
herself
a
few
pints
of
god
blood
until
you
what
explained
buffy
frowns
looks
at
dawn
and
back
at
spike
you
think
she'd
no

told
willow

at
buffy
i'd
do
it
buffy
continues
to
stare
at
him
as

had
done
that
to
me
buffy
glances
at
spike
jumps
up
and
races
out
cut
back
to
glory's
apartment
shatter
the
mirrors
in
the
room
all
shatter
and
the
glass
flies
toward
glory
slicing
her
dress
into
shreds
but
not
harming
her
is
that
it
is
that
the
best
you

care
about
all
this
the
apartment
the
clothes

pulls
off
the
shreds
of
her
dress
revealing
a
black
negligee
underneath
she
backhands
willow
who
flies
backward
and
topples
over
a
sofa
landing
on
the
floor
now
sucking
on
your
girlfriend's
mind
willow
lifts
her
head
her
eyes
are
still
all
black
that
was
something
to
treasure
willow
gets
to
her
feet
wearing
a
very
angry
expression
there's
a
small
trickle
of
blood
coming
out
of
her
mouth
and
down
her
chin
shot
of
the
black
bag
on
the
floor

slides
across
the
floor
toward

bag
opens
of
its

of
daggers

up
a
coffeetable
and
throws
it
at

knocking
her
down

braces
herself
up
on

and
looks
back
at

writhing
striking
near

out
of
the
carpet
glory's
standing
on
and
winds
itself
around
her
leg
shot
of

still
on
the
floor
panting
and
watching
glory
shakes
her
foot
and
the
snake
disappears
in
a
puff
of
smoke
glory
walks
forward
now
this
is
getting

grabs
willow
by
the
