int
living
room
at
buffy's
house
night
the
sits
giles
and
the
scooby
gang—minus
buffy
spike
and
andrew—are
sitting
together
in
the
living
room
having
a
very
disorganized
discussion
everyone
is
talking
over
everyone
else
power
to
the
people
you
sound
like
a
child
of
the
seventies
what
we're
saying
is
we're
in
charge
in
charge
of
ourselves
ok
you
guys
let's
just
try
not
to
freak
out
all
i'm
saying
is
now
that
buffy's
not
here
we
finally
have
some
say
in
how
and
when
we
lose
our
necks
maybe
you
don't
have
to
be
so
blunt
about
robin
gestures
a
cutting
motion
with
his
hand
in
front
of
his
neck
the
losing
of
the
necks
bit
anya
emphatically
no
let
the
girl
speak
the
truth
we're
all
on
death's
door
repeatedly
ringing
the
doorbell
like
maniacal
girl
scouts
trying
to
make
quota
xander
shifts
in
his
seat
you
know
i'm
thinking
that
everyone
here
shouldn't
have
a
say
we
just
have
to
find
some
way
of
having
constructive
dialogue
without
going
completely
mad
do
you
know
the
parliamentary
procedure
'cause
that's
a
convenient
way
of
organizing—
i
just
wonder
if
those
of
us
who
have
been
here
longer
should
have
more
of
a
say
maybe
we
should
break
down
into
small
groups
so
it
wouldn't
be
so
chaotic
faith
what
do
you
think
when
i
was
involved
with
the
model
un
we
found
the
parliamentary
procedure
to
be
a
total
lifesaver
for
example
once
when
i
was
uruguay—anyway
one
of
those
u
countries—it
was
like
here
only
we
had
this
system
which
allowed
us
to
organize
our
conversation
while
amanda
is
talking
giles
whispers
to
dawn
giles
to
dawn
she's
going
to
be
fine
really
it's
for
the
best
dawn
to
giles
yeah
then
why
do
i
feel
like
this
faith
to
the
group
i
hear
what
you're
saying
but—
shouldn't
we
get
down
to
business
willow
rolls
her
eyes
you
guys
i
think
we're
wasting
time
arguing
about
how
to
argue
well
why
don't
we—
vi
to
amanda
please
do
not
mention
parliamentary
procedure
caridad
under
her
breath
i
second
that
everyone
listen
to
me
chill
all
right
it's
been
a
long
night
and
i
don't
know
about
you
but
i'm
wiped
maybe
we
should
catch
some
sleep
and
figure
all
this
out
in
the
morning
do
we
really
have
time
to
waste
look
i
understand
you
guys
are
wicked
stressed
frankly
our
situation
blows
we've
got
to
stay
cool
that's
the
only
way
we're
going
to
get
through
this

everyone
handle

with

and
every
minute
we're
stuck
here
the
slayer's
out

and
scoobies
and

giles
and
faith
are
down
in
the
basement
having
another
meeting
by
candlelight
anya
xander
and
dawn
are
sitting
at
a
table
the
others
are
gathered
around
all
right
so
what
do
we
know
well
we
know
we're
basically
the
last
humans
left
in
sunnydale
and
that
all
the
evil
in
town
wants
us
dead
i
don't
want
to
die
don't
worry
it's
far
more
likely
you'll
live
long
enough
to
watch
most
of
your
friends
die
first
anya
looks
at
vi
and
then
you'll
die
we
also
know
that
caleb
told
buffy
that
everything's
going
down
at
the
seal
i
think
we
should
head—
faith
cuts
her
off
let's
not
get
ahead
of
ourselves
so
we
know
we've
got
a
lot
of
enemies
we'll
start
there
faith
i'm
sorry—
faith
cuts
her
off
again
i
got
this
ok
so
let's
go
over
our
rogues'
gallery
who
exactly
do
we
have
here
well
there's
the
first
who
we
can't
touch
then
there's
our
friend
the
reverend
ihatewomen
who's
basically
untouchable
there's
the
'roidrage
vamps
who
are
pretty
much
the
worst
and
the—
bringersi
think
they're
our
weakest
link
are
you
thinking
of
attacking
the
bringers
maybe
or
ok
we
could
kidnap
one
kennedy
nastily
and
what
hold
it
ransom
xander
sarcastically
yeah
i'll
get
the
magazines
and
start
ripping
out
the
letters
now
dear
mr
first
if
you
want
your
bringer
back
well
we'll
be
surprised
because
you
got
like
3
million
of
them
so
please
disregard
this
letter
yours
sincerely—
i'm
saying
we
think
about
getting
us
a
bringer
and
making
it
talk
find
out
info
on
the
first
and
caleb
that
way
how
do
you
think
we
should
catch
one
if
they
don't
want
to
be
found
ok
i'm
not
sure
this
is
such
a
good
idea
why
try
and
get
information
when
we
already
know
about
the
seal
why
don't
we
send
a
team
to
the
high
school
do
some
recon
and—
no
kennedy
sits
back
raises
eyebrows
just
like
that
you're
not
even
listening
willow
softly
to
kennedy
sweetie
you're
pushing
too
hard
i
thought
things
would
be
different
now
but
you
keep
shutting
me
down
things
are
different
because
now
faith
stands
i'm
your
boss
look
you
guys
i'm
not
buffy
i'm
not
the
one
who's
been
on
your
asses
all
this
time
but
i'm
not
one
of
you
anymore
either
i'm
your
leader
which
means
i
go
first
and
i
make
the
rules
and
the
rest
of
you
follow
after
me
is
that
clear
so
kennedy
faith
points
back
the
hell
off
and
let
me
do
my
job
all
right
faith
calmly
ok

some
better
news
and
i
wish
i
had
some
is
this
going
to
do
anything
or
is
all
of
this
just
to
make
the
bringers
sweat
do
the
bringers
sweat
actually
i
think
they
pant
like
dogs
and
i
don't
know
if
this
is
going
to
do
any
good
but
we
have
to
try
everything
you
realize
what
will
happen
if
the
slayer
and
her
girls
get
it
don't
you
they
won't
first
buffy
looks
at
caleb
that's
right
they
won't
first
buffy
walks
away
because
you're
going
to
kill
all
of
them
and
everyone
they
know
hallelujah
cut
to

alley
night
kennedy
walks
down
the
alley
alone
looking
at
the
ground
and
pouting
a
bringer
comes
up
behind
her
wielding
a
knife
but
someone
lassos
him
around
the
neck
and
pulls
him
to
the
ground
it's
giles
giles
ties
up
the
bringer
as
the
other
potential
slayers
go
to
kennedy's
aid
fighting
off
the
other
bringers
that
have
shown
up
using
the
bringers'
knives
against
them
kennedy
stands
after
killing
a
bringer
panting
i've
never
been
the
bait
before
that
was
uh
actually
kind
of
scary
we
had
your
back
giles
tying
up
a
bringer
you
did
well
your
performance
as
a
disgruntled
minion
was
spot
on
i'm
method
kennedy
smiles
let's
get
this
back
to
the
captain
fade
to
black
act
ii

cut
to
16
int
kitchen
at
buffy's
house
dusk
giles
and
a
few
others
come
up
from
the
basement
to
talk
to
the
gang
assembled
in
the
kitchen
dawn
sees
giles
oh
hey
so
uh
the
bringer's
dumb
giles
puts
on
his
glasses
you
were
expecting
what
a
rhodes
scholar
dumb
as
in
mute
someone
ripped
out
its
tongue
oh
gross
heyi've
been
reading
this
old
turkish
spell
book
there's
an
old
conjuration
that
the
ancient
turks
used
to
communicate
with
the
dying
oh
yeah
i
think
i've
read
a
translation
of
it
dawn
wideeyed
there's
a
translation
of
it
dawn
sighs
i'm
over
it
um
so
the
spell
is
used
to
communicate
with
people
who
can't
talk
um
like
if
a
person
was
dying
this
spell
would
let
them
say
their
goodbyes
or
you
know
gripe
about
how
nobody
came
to
visit
them
would
this
help
us
with
mr
notongue
yeah
i
think
so
i
just
need
to
get
together
a
few
ingredients
all
right
well
cool
while
willow
does
that
the
rest
of
us
can—
we're
back
spike
walks
into
the
room
spike
hey
andrew
walks
into
the
room
puts
his
helmet
on
a
shelf
hi
everybody
i
missed
you
guys
a
lot
sorry
it
took
so
long
to
get
back
from
our
missionmission
but
we
had
to
wait
out
the
sun
well
i
think
our
mission
went
very
well
we
uh
we
rode
on
spike's
hog
which
was
very
cool
and
uh
uh
played
some
amusing
games
and—oh
we
got
some
new
information
you
know
what
i
really
need
to
urinate
andrew
walks
out
of
the
room
he's
a
breath
of
fresh
air
isn't
he
thank
god
i
don't
breathe
so
i
think
we
got
a
lead
where's
buffy
um
dawn
looks
away
she's
not
here
right
now
when's
she
get
back
willow
walks
toward
spike
wringing
her
hands
nervously
uhwhile
you
were
gone
we
all
got
together
and
ttalked
out
some
disagreements
that
we
were
having
um
and
eventually
after
much
discussion
buffy
decided
that
it
would
be
best
for
all
of
us
if
she
took
a
little
time
off
a
little
breather
spike
stares
in
disbelief
uhhuh
i
see
been
practicing
that
little
speech
long
have
you
spike
willow
looks
hurt
and
walks
away
so
uh
buffy
took
some
time
off
right
in
the
middle
of
the
apocalypse
and
it
was
her
decision
well
we
all
decided
oh
yeah
you
all
decided
spike
chuckles
you
sad
sad
ungrateful
traitors
who
do
you
think
you
are
we're
her
friends
we
just
want—
oh

ballsy
of
you
you're
her
friends

full
of
wisdom

she's
surpassed
you
and
you
can't
handle
it
she
has
saved
your
lives
again
and
again
spike
the
others
roll
their
eyes
and
avoid
eye
contact
with
spike
she's
died
for
you
and
this
is
how
you
thank—
hey
why

notch
or

the
dining
room
after
spike
and
starts

repeatedly

pretty
hard
she
gets
to
her
feet
as

and
down
the
path
toward
the
street
he
pauses
shuts
his
eyes
and
smells
purposefully

looking
for
and
walks
down

street
cut

up
to
the
room
where
she's

standing
in

spike
walks
up
to
buffy
i

i
was
over
there
that
bitch
spike
sighs
she's
all
about
smiles
and
reformation
when
you're
on
your
feet
but
the
moment
you're
down
she's
all
about
the
kicking
isn't
that
right
makes
me
want—
buffy
softly
staring
off
into
the
corner
it
wasn't
just
faith
it
was
all
of
them
buffy
looks
at
spike
and
it's
not
like
they
were
wrong
please
leave
no
spike
excited
this'll
change
your
tune

came
here
'cause

got
something
to
tell
you
you
were
right
caleb
is
trying
to
protect
something
from
you
and
i
think
you
were
spot
on
all
the
way
i
think
it's
at
the
vineyard
so
you
were
right
spike
she
still
hasn't
moved
or
reacted
buffy
i
don't
feel
very
right
spike
walks
closer
to
her
you're
not
fooling
me

do
you
even
mean
well
you're
not
a
quitter
watch
me
you
were
their
leader
and
you
still
are
this
isn't
something
you
gave
up
it's
something
they
took
buffy

at
him

the
difference
is

take
it
back

my
favorite

first
mayor

a
proper
young
lady

when
jo
burned
her
hair
faith
looks
in
his
face
i
know
what
you're

and
it's
not

worry
about
the
girls
of

you're
doing
a
great
job
with
them
by
the
way
much
better
than
buffy
ever
did
you
were
smart
to
kick
her
out
faith
shakes
her
head
that's
not
what
we—
faith
the
mayor
looks
at
her
raises
his
eyebrows
in
disbelief
buffy
got
them
this
far
why
are
you
protecting
her
you
think
she
cares
about
you
she
nearly
killed
you
faith
it's
different
now
first
mayor
walks
up
to
faith
no
matter
what
you
do
buffy
will
always
see
you
as
a
killer
not
as
a
person
and
now
you
have
what
she
so
desperately
wants
the
respect
of
these
girls
all
she
needs
is
an
excuse
and
she'll
finish
what
she
started
when
she
stuck
that
knife
in
your
belly
you
stay
on
guard
faith
buffy's
dangerous
if
you're
not
careful
she'll
destroy
you
first
mayor
shrugs
i'm
just
saying

of
the
bed
beside

i
came
hit
faith
a
bunch
of
times

she's
a
footnote
in
history

make
it
look
like
a
painful
accident
that's
my
problem
i
say
the
word
some

diesevery
time
there's
always
casualties

up

i'm
still
making
excuses
i've
always
cut
myself
off
i've
always—
buffy
sighs
being
the
slayer
made
me
different
but
it's
my
fault
i
stayed
that
way
people
are
always
trying
to
connect
to
me
and
i
just
slip
away
buffy
chuckles
you
should
know
i
seem
to
recall
a
certain
amount
of
connecting
buffy
shakes
her
head

bit
longer
than

imagine
and
done
things

i
don't
exactly
have
a
reputation
for
being
a
thinker
i
follow
my
blood
which
doesn't
exactly
rush
in
the
direction
of
my
brain
so
i
make
a
lot
of
mistakes
a
lot
of
wrong
bloody
calls
spike
looks
into
her
eyes
a
100+
years
and
there's
only
one
thing
i've
ever
been
sure
of
you
spike
buffy
looks
away
he
reaches
toward
her
face
hey

at
me
i'm
not
asking
you
for
anything
when
i
say
i
love
you
it's
not
because
i
want
you
or
because
i
can't
have
you
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
spike
a
tear
rolls
down
buffy's
cheek
i
love
what
you

i've
seen
your
kindness
and
your

a
flash
of
light
robin
touches
faith's
shoulder
faith
faith
startled
you
shouldn't
sneak
up
like
that
i
almost

what
i'm
doing
faith
turns
around
i'm
just—

gonna
leave
you
alone
i
didn't
mean
to
intrude
robin
starts
to
walk
away

was
the
first
robin
walks
back
into
the
room
shuts
the
door
well
you're
really
in
the
game
now
faith
the
first
doesn't
show
itself
unless
it
thinks
you
matter
lucky
me
i'm
a
player
faith
holds
out
her
hand
man
look
at
that
my
hand's
shaking
demons
vampires
women
in
the
penitentiary
system—none
of
that
freaks
me
out
that's
exactly
what
the
first
does—finds
your
achilles'
heel
nah
it
just
talked
to
me
what
it
does
a
heal
thing
too
um
it's
a
phrase
your
weak
spot
oh
school
thing
faith
looks
away
i
was
kinda
absent
that
decade
faith
sits
on
edge
of
the
bed
robin
walks
up
to
faith
sits
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
beside
her
so
who
was
it
the
first
he
was
like
an
old
boss
of
mine
just
a
boss
and
he's
got
you
shaking
like
this
wouldn't
give
you
a
raise
huh
faith
laughs
yeah
right
well
it
sounds
retarded
but
he
was
like
a
dad
to
me
oh
it
was
my
mother
when
it
came
to
me
and
i
mean
it
was
her
right
down
to
the
perfume
faith
looks
at
him
sorry
robin
nods
yeah
i'm
just
so
pissed
off
at
myself
i
knew
it
was
a
trick
yeah
so
did
i
but
i
still
wanted
my
mother
to
hold
me
like
a
little
baby—
robin
blinks
sits
up
in
a
manly
way
of
course
of
course
listen
nobody
wants
to
be
alone
faith
we
all
want
someone
who
cares
to
be
touched
that
way
robin
looks
at
her
i
mean
the
first
deals
in
figments
but
that
wanting
is
real
hitting
things
and
a
whole
lot
of
jack
d
dulls
it
some
among
other
things
robin
they
both
smile
faith
stands
when
it
came
to
you
did
the
first
tell
the
truth
yeah
it
said
to
watch
out
for
buffy
that
buffy's
dangerous
well
what
do
you
think
faith
paces
could
be
i
mean
we've
given
her
pretty
good
reason
to
be
pissed
off
you
know
the
messed
up
thing
the
first
is
telling
me
to
worry
about
her
and
i
just
wish
she
was
here
in
a
couple
hours
i'm
gonna
lead
these
girls
into
some
serious
crap
and
she's
the
only
one—
robin
exasperated
she's
not
the
only
one
you're
a
slayer
too
faith
and
i
think
you're
a
good
leader
i'm
an
excon
who
didn't
finish
high
school
yeah
well
i'm
the
principal
of
a
school
where
nobody
finished
and
i
am
completely
out
of
my
league
in
this
well
i
hear
otherwise
robin
scoffs
stands
so
um
tomorrow
then
forget
about
tomorrow
this
is
tonight
faith
pulls
his
hand
toward
her
face
it's
been
a
while
am
i
out
of
line
no
you're
the
leader
faith
and
robin
kiss
he
lifts
her
up
in
his
arms
and
she
pushes
him
back
onto
the
bed
robin
starts
pulling
on
her
shirt
as
they
make
out
cut
to
23
int
willow's
room
at
buffy's
house
night
willow
walks
into
her
room
looking
at
a
map
ok
guys
giles
said
faith
wants
us
to
start
early
in
the
morning
so—
willow
looks
around
at
her
mostly
empty
room
except
for
kennedy
on
the
bed
what
happened
to
the
girls
kennedy
lying
sexily
across
the
bed
wearing
a
slinky
nightie
and
twirling
her
hair
looks
like
there's
only
one
girl
here
what
about
the
other
ones
with
their
sleeping
bags
and
their
headgear
and
their
snoring
willow
smiles
they're
not
here

they
nope
willow
shuts
the
door
well
that's
nice
willow
sits
on
the
bed
nice
kennedy
kissses
willow
and
necessary
kennedy
puts
her
arm
around
willow's
waist
come

kennedy
pushes
willow
back
on
the
bed
so
they're
lying
down
beside
each
other
they're
still
kissing
foreplay
was
threatening
to
turn
into
twelveplay
kennedy
willow
turns
away
something
not
right
no
no
i
just
uh
guess
i'm
a
little
scared
it's
probably
stupid
to
ask
why

death
war
apocalypse
me
i'm
just
scared
that
if
we
and
then
i'll
and
then
