more
with
feeling
splash
across
the
screen
in
the
style
of
an
old
movie
musical
pan
down
to
reveal
an
oldfashioned
alarm
clock
the
kind
with
actual
bells

it
up

at
it

the
overture
music
is
a
medley
of
the
musical
themes
from
the
rest
of
the

begins
with
willow
walking
across
her
bedroom
then
she
turns
and
goes
back
the
way
she
came

a
sweater
from
a
chair
and
exits
into
the
bathroom

finds
the
herb
that

used
to
do
the
forget

picks
it
up
sniffs
it
smiles
pan

dawn
runs
out
of
her
room
and
over
to
the
bathroom
door
she
knocks
on
the
door
while
jumping
from
foot
to
foot
as
if
she
has
to
pee
willow
comes
out
of
the
bathroom
brushing
her
hair
dawn
rushes
into
the
bathroom
pan
across
the
hallway
again
to
reveal
buffy
still
lying
in
bed
awake
cut
to
the
magic
shop
overture
music
continues
xander
and
anya
are
looking
at
a
bridal
magazine
smiling
and
talking
we
don't
hear
their
dialogue
a
customer
comes
over
and
anya
escorts
her
toward
the
cash
register
pan
across
to
dawn
standing
by
the
bookshelves
looking
at
a
book
giles
comes
over
and
takes
the
book
away
dawn
looks
annoyed
giles
gestures
with
the
book
and
she
walks
off
pan
to
the
round
table
where
we
see
willow
and
tara
looking
at
a
book
together
and
taking
notes
pan
further
and
we
see
buffy
sitting
next
to
tara
sketching
on
a
pad
giles
comes
over
and
holds
a
large
axe
in
buffy's
line
of
sight
then
he
gestures
with
his
head
toward
the
back
and
walks
away
buffy
puts
down
her
sketch
pad
gets
up
and
follows
giles
toward
the
workout
room
taking
off
her
sweater
as
she
goes
end
overture
cut
to
the
graveyard
night
buffy
walks
along
looking
around
suddenly
she
begins
to
sing
song
alive
begins
every
single
night
the
same
arrangement
i
go
out
and
fight
the
fight
still
i
always
feel
this
strange
estrangement
nothing
here
is
real
nothing
here
is
right
a
vampire
appears
from
behind
a
gravestone
rushes
at
buffy
she
spins
him
around
continues
singing
i've
been
making
shows
of
buffy
punches
trading
blows
just
hoping
no
one
knows
buffy
kicks
grabs
vampire
and
throws
him
behind
her
that
i've
been
going
through
the
motions
walking
through
the
part
buffy
pulls
a
stake
from
her
jacket
pocket
the
vamp
attacks
her
from
behind
and
she
stakes
him
without
looking
back
nothing
seems
to
penetrate
my
heart
she
resumes
walking
and
singing
i
was
always
brave
and
kind
of
righteous
now
i
find
i'm
wavering
we
see
two
vampires
and
a
demon
gathered
near
a
tree
there's
a
person
tied
to
the
tree
the
vampires
see
buffy
and
attack
crawl
out
of
your
grave
you'll
find
this
fight
just
buffy
punches
a
vampire
doesn't
mean
a
thing
buffy
punches
second
vamp
she
ain't
got
that
swing
the
vamp
punches
buffy
and
she
goes
down
a
sword
is
stuck
in
the
ground
beside
her
she
lies
there
on
her
back
sound
of
crickets
chirping
thanks
for
noticing
she
continues
lying
there
as
the
two
vamps
and
the
demon
begin
to
do
a
dance
she
does
pretty
well
with
fiends
from
hell
but
lately
we
can
tell
buffy
gets
up
and
grabs
the
sword
that
she's
just
going
through
the
motions
going
through
the
motions
buffy
pulls
vamp
1
away
cuts
off
his
head
with
the
sword
faking
it
somehow
buffy
pushes
him
aside
stabs
the
demon
she's
not
even
half
the
girl
she
demon
looks
down
at
his
wound
ow
the
demon
falls
over
buffy
continues
walking
holding
the
sword
will
i
stay
this
way
forever
sleepwalk
through
my
life's
endeavor
she
uses
the
sword
to
cut
the
ropes
that
are
tying
the
person
to
a
tree
the
person
comes
around
the
tree
trunk
and
we
see
it's
a
very
goodlooking
man
how
can
i
repay
whatever
she
turns
away
tosses
the
sword
aside
and
continues
walking
i
don't
want
to
beeeeee
buffy
walks
up
onto
a
raised
platform
ringed
by
statues
stops
going
through
the
motions
losing
all
my
drive
i
can't
even
see
if
this
is
really
me
and
i
just
want
to
be
vamp
2
attacks
her
and
she
stakes
him
he
explodes
into
dust
which
forms
an
artful
cloud
obscuring
buffy
from
view
then
clears
as
she
sings
the
final
word
aliiiiiive
end
of
song
alive
wide
aerial
shot
of
buffy
standing
amidst
the
gravestones
cut
to
magic
shop
day
the
bell
jingles
buffy
enters
giles
os
good
morning
buffy
we
see
willow
and
tara
standing
by
the
counter
giles
in
background
oh
hey
did
dawn
get
off
to
school
all
right
buffy
distracted
what
oh
uh
yeah
i
think
so
buffy
walks
farther
into
the
store
we
see
xander
sitting
at
the
round
table
holding
a
donut
in
each
hand
respect
the
cruller
and
tame
the
donut
anya
passes
by
en
route
to
the
counter
that's
still
funny
sweetie
anya
goes
behind
the
counter
giles
looks
in
the
box
of
donuts
takes
one
out
takes
a
bite
so
uh
no
research
nothing
going
on
monsters
or
whatnot
giles
and
xander
shake
their
heads
no
continue
eating
donuts
good
good
buffy
awkwardly
uh
so
did
anybody
uh
last
night
you
know
did
anybody
um
burst
into
song
giles
stops
chewing
everyone
stares
at
buffy
for
a
moment
merciful
zeus
willow
tara
and
anya
rush
over
everyone
talks
at
once
we
thought
it
was
just
us
well
i
sang
but
i
had
my
guitar
at
the
hotel
it
was
bizarre
we
were
talking
and
then
it
was
like
like
you
were
in
a
musical
yeah
that
would
explain
the
huge
backing
orchestra
i
couldn't
see
and
the
synchronized
dancing
from
the
room
service
chaps
we
did
a
whole
duet
about
dish
washing
and
we
were
arguing
and
and
then
everything
rhymed
and
there
were
harmonies
and
the
dance
with
coconuts
there
was
an
entire
verse
about
the
couscous
it
was
very
disturbing
everyone
is
talking
at
once
giles
to
buffy
what
did
you
sing
about
buffy
pauses
i
don't
remember
but
iit
seemed
perfectly
normal
but
disturbing
and
not
the
natural
order
of
things
and
do
you
think
it'll
happen
again
i
don't
know
i
should
look
into
it
with
the
books
do
we
have
any
books
on
this
well
we
just
gotta
break
it
down
look
at
the
factors
before
it
happens
again
because
i
for
one
giles
begins
to
sing
interrupting
xander
song
i've
got
a
theory
begins
i've
got
a
theory
that
it's
a
demon
a
dancing
demon
no
something
isn't
right
there
i've
got
a
theory
some
kid
is
dreamin'
and
we're
all
stuck
inside
his
wacky
broadway
nightmare
tara
doing
jazz
hands
i've
got
a
theory
we
should
work
this
out
it's
getting
eerie
what's
this
cheery
singing
all
about
xander
jumps
up
it
could
be
witches
some
evil
witches
xander
sees
willow's
and
tara's
expressions
which
is
ridiculous
'cause
witches
they
were
persecuted
wicca
good
and
love
the
earth
and
woman
power
and
i'll
be
over
here
xander
sits
i've
got
a
theory
it
could
be
bunnies
silence
the
others
just
stare
at
her
sound
of
crickets
chirping
i've
got
a
suddenly
the
tune
changes
to
a
frantic
hardrock
beat
with
electric
guitar
and
a
roving
spotlight
that
waves
crazily
over
anya
anya
shrieking
a
la
alanis
morissette
bunnies
aren't
just
cute
like
everybody
supposes
they've
got
them
hoppy
legs
and
twitchy
little
noses
and
what's
with
all
the
carrots
what
do
they
need
such
good
eyesight
for
anyway
anya
playing
air
guitar
bunnies
bunnies
it
must
be
bunnies
fireworks
go
off
all
around
her
then
the
smoke
clears
away
the
others
continue
simply
staring
or
maybe
midgets
willow
quickly
sits
down
beside
giles
and
opens
a
book
i've
got
a
theory
we
should
work
this
fast
because
it
clearly
could
get
serious
before
it's
passed
giles
gets
up
starts
to
climb
the
stairs
to
the
loft
i've
got
a
theory
it
doesn't
matter
giles
pauses
turns
back
everyone
looks
at
buffy
what
can't
we
face
if
we're
together
what's
in
this
place
that
we
can't
weather
apocalypse
we've
all
been
there
the
same
old
trips
why
should
we
care
what
can't
we
do
if
we
get
in
it
we'll
work
it
through
within
a
minute
buffy
looks
at
giles
throughout
this
he
watches
her
too
and
finally
joins
in
we
have
to
try
we'll
pay
the
price
it's
do
or
die
hey
i've
died
twice
giles
smiles
comes
down
off
the
ladder
what
can't
we
face
if
we're
together
what
can't
we
face
what's
in
this
place
that
we
can't
weather
if
we're
together
there's
nothing
we
can't
face
anya
sits
except
for
bunnies
end
of
song
i've
got
a
theory
xander
sits
see
okay
that
was
disturbing
willow
sits
i
thought
it
was
neat
so
what
is
it
what's
causing
it
i
thought
it
didn't
matter
well
i'm
not
exactly
quaking
in
my
stylish
yet
affordable
boots
but
there's
definitely
something
unnatural
going
on
here
and
that
doesn't
usually
lead
to
hugs
and
puppies
well
is
it
just
us
i
mean
is
it
only
happening
to
us
anya
buffy
turns
away
'cause
that
would
probably
mean
a
spell
or
buffy
goes
to
the

opens
it

with
mystical
chants
bacchanals
dawn
glances
at
the
counter
sees
a
necklace
lying
there
it
might
be
relevant
yeah
we
could
um
well
i'm
a
hair's
breadth
from
investigating
bunnies
at
the
moment
so
i'm
open
to
anything
dawn
furtively
picks
up
the
necklace
and
puts
it
in
her
pocket
great
we'll
uh
go
check
it
out
and
uh
we'll
give

sunny
and
beautiful
green
grass

cooped
up
on
a
day
like

the
sun
is
shining
there's
songs
going
on
a
couple
of
young
men
walk
by
and

at
willow
and
tara
as
they
pass
those
guys

her
and
pulls
her
back
tara
giggles

to
fight
to
keep
you
'cause
i'm
not
large
with
the
butch
they
stand
underneath
a
tree
leaning
on
a
wooden
railing
i'm
just
not
used
to
that
theythey
were
really
looking
at

imagine
what
they

in
you
i

what
they
see
in
me
you
song
i'm
under
your
spell
begins
i
lived
my
life
in
shadow
never
the
sun
on
my
face
it
didn't
seem
so
sad
though
i
figured
that
was
my
place
now
i'm
bathed
in
light
tara
walking
out
from
the
shade
lifting
her
face
to
the
sun
something
just
isn't
right
i'm
under
your
spell
how
else
could
it
be
anyone
would
notice
me
it's
magic
i
can
tell
how
you
set
me
free
brought
me
out
so
easily
pan
across
a
little
stream
with
a
bridge
over
it
willow
and
tara
are
on
the
bridge
tara
takes
willow's
hand
and
they
walk
off
the
bridge
onto
a
path
holding
hands
i
saw
a
world
enchanted
spirits
and
charms
in
the
air
tara
makes
a
gesture
with
her
arm
and
sparkles
appear
following
her
hand
with
a
little
tinkling
noise
i
always
took
for
granted
i
was
the
only
one
there
willow
makes
some
even
more
impressive
sparkles
with
her
hand
ending
in
a
small
shower
of
sparks
surrounding
them
both
they
smile
at
each
other
but
your
power
shone
brighter
than
any
i've
known
tara
spins
away
from
willow
we
see
a
small
pond
at
the
edge
of
the
grass
tara
begins
to
dance
i'm
under
your
spell
nothing
i
can
do
you
just
took
my
soul
with
you
a
couple
of
young
women
are
on
the
grass
sunbathing
in
the
background
they
get
up
and
begin
dancing
in
sync
with
tara
you
worked
your
charms
so
well
finally
i
knew
everything
i
dreamed
was
true
you
made
me
believe
ahhh
ahhh
ahhh
willow
and
tara
spin
around
in
each
other's
arms
suddenly
they
are
in
their
bedroom
they
sit
down
on
the
bed
and
look
lovingly
at
each
other
the
music
and
background
ahh
ahh
continues
the
moon
to
the
tide
i
can
feel
you
inside
i'm
under
your
spell
tara
lies
down
on
the
bed
surging
like
the
sea
willow
leans
over
her
smiles
wanting
you
so
helplessly
i
break
with
every
swell
willow
moves
downward
disappears
out
of
shot
lost
in
ecstasy
spread
beneath
my
willow
tree
you
make
me
complete
tara's
body
slowly
rises
up
and
hovers
over
the
bed
ou
make
me
complete
you
make
me
complete
you
make
me
cut
back
to
the
magic
shop
everyone
still
looking
at
books
i
bet
they're
not
even
working
who
now
willow
and
tara
you
see
the
way
they
were
with
each
other
the
getaroominess
to
them
i
bet
they're
xander
glances
at
dawn
catches
himself
singing
they're
probably
singing
right
now
i'm
sure
willow
and
tara
are
making
every
effort
oh
yeah
xander
buffy
it's
okay
i
do
know
about
this
stuff
besides
it's
all
kinda
romantic

not
come
on
songs
dancing
around
what's
gonna
be
wrong
with
that
cut
to
the
bronze
it's
dark
a
man
is
tapdancing
across
the
floor
cut
closer
and
we
see
that
his
expression
is
scared
and
desperate
he
continues
dancing
and
suddenly
bursts
into
flame
screaming
he
falls
to
the
floor
in
front
of
a
pair
of
feet
in
red
shoes
and
red
pants
pan
up
to
reveal
a
demon
in
a
red
suit

temporary
like
her
toes

kind
of
hairy
both

the
street
anya
and
xander
are
on
either
side
of
giles
all
walking
down
the
street
anya
and
xander
both
talking
at
once
it's
a
nightmare
it
has
to
be
stopped
it's
a
plague
it's
like
a
nightmare
about
a
plague
it
was
like
we
were
being
watched
it's
like
i
didn't
wanna
be
saying
things
like
there
was
a
wall
missing
but
they
just
kept
pouring
out
in
our
apartment
and
they
rhymed
and
they
were
mean
and
like
there
were
only
three
walls
and
not
a
fourth
wall
and
my
eyes
are
not
beady
my
toes
are
not
hairy
they
stop
talking
over
each
other
giles
you've
got
to
stop
it
well
i
am
looking
into
some
leads
and
i
it's
just
clearly
our
number
is
a
retro
pastiche
that's
never
going
to
be
a
breakaway
pop
hit
work
with
me
british
man
give
me
an
axe
and
show
me
where
to
point
it
we
hear
a
woman
singing
but
we
can't
see
her
or
make
out
the
words
yet
well
now
xander
it's
not
quite
that
simple
but
i
have
learned
about
some
disturbing
things
basically
they
continue
talking
in
the
background
as
we
focus
on
a
woman
btvs
executive
producer
marti
noxon
who
is
standing
by
her
car
singing
to
a
policeman
the
cop
is
writing
her
a
parking
ticket
and
we
see
that
her
car
is
parked
next
to
a
fire
hydrant
as
she
sings
we
can
see
giles
xander
and
anya
standing
and
talking
in
background
i'm
asking
you
please
no
it
isn't
right
it
isn't
fair
there
was
no
parking
anywhere
i
think
that
hydrant
wasn't
there
cop
gives
her
the
ticket
why
can't
you
let
it
go
i
think
i've
paid
more
than
my
share
she
continues
singing
in
the
background
as
xander
anya
and
giles
resume
walking
and
talking
as
in
burnt
up
somebody
set
people
on
fire
that's
nuts
i
don't
know
one
more
verse
of
our
little
ditty
and
i
would've
been
looking
for
a
gas
can
well
clearly
emotions
are
running
high
giles
we
see
people
in
background
dancing
together
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
these
people
burnt
up
from
the
inside
spontaneously
combusted
giles
three
street
sweeper
men
in
background
dancing
with
brooms
i've
only
seen
the
one
i
was
able
to
examine
the
body
while
the
police
were
taking
witness
arias
okay
but
we're
sure
that
the
things
are
related
the
singing
and
dancing
and
burning
and
dying
they
stop
walking
the
street
sweepers
continue
their
dance
in
background
we're
not
sure
of
much
buffy's
looking
for
leads
at
the
local
demon
haunts
at
least
in
theory
she
is
but
she
doesn't
seem
to
she's
easing
back
into
it
we
pulled
her
out
of
an
untold
hell
dimension
ergo
the
weirdness
the
important
thing
is
to
be
there
for
her
giles
shakes
head
i'm
helping
her
as
much
as
i
can
but
uh
anya
pats
giles
awkwardly
on
the
shoulder
cut
to
spike's
crypt
buffy
enters
spike
emerges
from
his
underground
lair
the
sun
sets
and
she
appears
spike
climbs
up
the
rest
of
the
way
come
to
serenade
me
so
you
know
what's
going
on
well
i've
seen
some
damn
funny
things
in
the
last
two
days
a
600
pound
chirago
demon
making
like
yma
sumac
that
one
will
stay
with
you
i
remain
immune
happy
to
say
spike
holds
up
a
bottle
of
whiskey
drink
a
world
of
no
buffy
sits
so
any
idea
what's
causing
this
spike
disappointed
oh

all
you've
just
come
to
pump
me
for
information

it
and
turns
toward
buffy

a
thing
buffy
frowns
what's
up

he
makes
a
gesture
toward
the
door
buffy
stays
seated

at
him
spike
defensive
it's
nothing
what
song

in
peace
begins
i
died
so
many
years
ago
spike
looks
surprised
to
hear
himself
singing
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
but
you
can
make
me
feel
like
it
isn't
so
spike
shakes
his
head
closes
the
door
and
why
you
come
to
be
with
me
i
think
i
finally
know
mmm
mmm
you're
scared
ashamed
of
what
you
feel
buffy
not
looking
at
him
and
you
can't
tell
the
ones
you
love
you
know
they
couldn't
deal
now
she
looks
at
him
frowns
whisper
in
a
dead
man's
ear
it
doesn't
make
it
real
spike
points
to
his
head
buffy
looks
at
him
then
looks
away
spike
rolls
his
eyes
in
annoyance
that's
great
but
i
don't
wanna
play
spike
walks
over
to
a
coffin
'cause
being
with
you
touches
me
more
than
i
can
say
but
since
i'm
only
dead
to
you
spike
jumps
up
to
sit
on
the
coffin
i'm
saying

away
spike
lies
down
on
the
coffin
crosses
arms
over
his
chest
and
let
me
rest
in
peace
spike
jumps
up
and
the
song
takes
on
an
angry
rock
beat
for
the
refrain
let
me
rest
in
peace
let
me
get
some
sleep
spike
grabs
whiskey
bottle
and
throws
it
against
the
wall
buffy
jumps
up
let
me
take
my
love
and
bury
it
in
a
hole
six
foot
deep
i
can
lay
my
body
down
spike
advancing
on
buffy
but
i
can't
find
my
sweet
release
spike
turns
away
from
her
with
an
angry
gesture
so
let
me
rest
in
peace
buffy
looks
annoyed
turns
toward
the
door
but
spike
intercepts
her
you
know
you've
got
a
willing
slave
spike
goes
to
his
knees
and
you
just
love
to
play
the
thought
that
you
might
misbehave
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
but
till
you
do
i'm
telling
you
spike
stands
up
stop
visiting
my
grave
spike
angrily
and
let
me
rest
in
peace
spike
yanks
the
door
open
again
cut
to
the
graveyard
a
group
of
men
carry
a
coffin
along
a
few
dozen
yards
away
we
see
spike
and
buffy
walking
along
sidebyside
i
know
i
should
go
but
i
follow
you
like
a
man
possessed
there's
a
traitor
here
beneath
my
breast
spike
exchanges
a
look
with
buffy
and
it
hurts
me
more
than
you've
ever
guessed
spike
looking
at
buffy
if
my
heart
could
beat
it
would
break
my
chest
they
stop
walking
but
i
can
see
you're
unimpressed
spike
angrily
so
leave
me
be
spike
jumps
up
onto
the
coffin
being
carried
by
the
men
and
let
me
rest
in
peace
let
me
get
some
sleep
the
pallbearers
tip
the
coffin
and
spike
tumbles
off
the
end
of
it
bounces
to
his
feet
and
shifts
into
game
face
let
me
take
my
love
and
bury
it
in
a
hole
six
foot
deep
he
rampages
through
the
mourners
tossing
their
foldingchairs
aside
the
people
scatter
i
can
lay
my
body
down
but
i
can't
find
my
sweet
release
he
grabs
the
priest
stares
at
him
buffy
comes
up
behind
spike
grabs
him
and
turns
him
around
spike
and
buffy
tumble
backward
into
the
open
grave
spike
lands
on
his
back
with
buffy
on
top
of
him
he's
back
in
human
face
let
me
rest
in

in
peace
they
still
lie
in
the
grave
with
buffy
on
top
she
stares
at
spike
for
a
moment
then
gets
off
him
leaps
out
of
the
grave
and
runs
off
spike
pokes
his
head
up
out
of
the
grave
to
watch
her
go
spike
speaks
so
you're
not
staying
then
cut
to
dawn's
bedroom
dawn

under
your
spell
melody

half
an
hour
alone

her
locked
house
ii
won't
be
gone
long
tara
leaves
dawn
goes
over
to
a
side
table
opens
a
small
wooden
box
it's
filled
with
stuff
she
has
taken
from
the
magic
shop
she
takes
out
the
necklace
from
before
and
puts
it
on
looks
at
herself
in
the
mirror
dawn
sings
does
anybody
even
notice
does
anybody
even
care
she
turns
around
to
find
a
demon
sweet's
minion
standing
behind
her
its
whole
head
is
like
a
big
mask
we
see
there
are
actually
three
of
the
minions
they
throw
a
bag
over
dawn's
head
she
continues
screaming
muffled
blackout
act
iii

open
on
the
bronze
pan
down
to
reveal
dawn
asleep
on
the
pool
table
she
suddenly
jerks
awake
sits
up
begins
to
do
a
ballet
dance
she
leaps
down
off
the
pool
table
and
is
confronted
by
one
of
the
mask
minions
they
do
a
balletish
dance
that
basically
represents
dawn
trying
to
escape
and
the
demon
stopping
her
the
other
two
demons
appear
and
join
the
dance
they
surround
dawn
as
she
huddles
close
to
the
floor
then
they
fling
her
and
she
goes
sliding
across
the
floor
stopping
beside
the
stage
we
see
sweet's
feet
in
red
pants
and
blackandwhite
dance
shoes
they
begin
to
do
a
tapdance
number
dance
down
the
stairs
and
toward
dawn
meanwhile
the
camera
moves
up
to
reveal
sweet
he
dances
around
to
the
other
side
of
dawn
song
that's
what
it's
all
about
begins
why'd
you
run
away
don't
you
like
my
style
he
snaps
his
fingers
and
his
red
suit
turns
to
a
blue
one
why
don't
you
come
and
play
i
guarantee
a
he
reaches
up
to
his
face
pulls
off
his
mouth
and
holds
the
disembodied
mouth
in
dawn's
face
she
stares
in
shock
as
the
mouth
continues
singing
great
big
smile
the
mouth
disappears
from
his
hand
and
reappears
in
its
normal
place
i
come
from
the
imagination
and
i'm
here
strictly
by
your
invocation
sweet
holds
up
a
scroll
covered
with
writing
so
what
do
you
say
why
don't

good
good
i

on
precision
and
concentration

as
power
giles

the
wood
down
we're
still
not

one
leg
up
on
the
horse

oh

figure
it
out

gonna
turn
into
some
training
montage
from
an
80's
movie
ah

if
we
hear
any
inspirational
power
chords
we'll
just
lie
down
until
they
go
away

up
a
towel
anyway
i
don't
think
we
need
to
work
that
much
on
your
strength

pretty
spry
for
a
corpse
buffy
doing
a
handstand
on

the
bronze
smoke
swirls
as

shoves
dawn
into
a
chair

to
sit
in
another
chair
beside
her
dawn
looks
scared
now
through
the
smoke
she
calls
to
me
to
make
my
way
across
the
flame
cut
back
to
buffy
standing
on
the
street
to
save
the
day
or

melt
away
i
guess
it's
all
the
same
so
i
will
walk
buffy
starts
to
walk
through
the
fire
'cause
where
else
can
i
turn
i
will
walk
through
the
fire
and
let
it
cut
to
spike
sitting
in
an
alley
smoking
a
cigarette
the
torch
i
bear
is
scorching
me
buffy's
laughing
i've
no
doubt
spike
takes
a
drag
i
hope
she
fries
i'm
free
if

spike
tosses
cigarette
away
angrily
then
jumps
up
i
better
help
her

spike
starts
walking
cut
to
the
bronze
'cause
she
is
drawn
to
the
fire
some
people
she
will
never
learn
spike
walking
down
the
street
sweet
standing
up
in
the
bronze
and
she
will
walk
through
the
fire
and
let
it
cut
to
the
magic
shop
willow
and
tara
sit
at
the
table
not
looking
at
each
other
giles
stands
behind
the
counter
will
this
do
a
thing
to
change
her
am
i
leaving
dawn
in
danger
is
my
slayer
too
far
gone
to
care
what
if
buffy
can't
defeat
it
beady
eyes
is
right
we're
needed
or
we
could
just
sit
around
and
glare
anya
looks
at
willow
and
tara
giles
comes
out
from
behind
the
counter
gives
willow
and
tara
a
look
they
get
up
and
they
all
start
walking
toward
the
door
we'll
see
it
through
it's
what
we're
always
here
to
do
so
we
will
walk
through
the
fire
cut
to
buffy
walking
alone
through
an
alley
so
one
by
one
they
turn
from
me
i
guess
my
friends
can't
face
the
cold
but
why
i
froze
not
one
among
them
knows
and
never
can
be
told
what
can't
we
face
if
we're
together
the
following
sequence
has
sweet
splitscreened
with
the
scoobies
as
they
walk
along
the
street
singing
basically
whoever's
singing
at
the
moment
is
on
screen
she
came
from
the
grave
much
graver
first
he'll
kill
her
then
i'll
save
her
everything
is
turning
out
so
dark
no
i'll
save
her
then
i'll
kill
her
i
think
this
line's
mostly
filler
what's
it
gonna
take
to
strike
a
spark
so
one
by
one
they
turn
to
me
the
distant
redness
as
their
guide
that
single
flame
ain't
what
they
had
in
mind
it's
what
they
have
inside
going
through
the
motions
walking
through
the
part
these
endless
days
are
finally
ending
in
a
blaze
she
will
come
to
me
and
we
are
caught
in
the
fire
buffy
walking
down
the
street
alone
the
point
of
no
return
so
we
will
walk
through
the
fire
the
scoobies
walking
down
the
street
a
fire
engine
goes
by
behind
them
with
lights
flashing
and
let

burn

like
other
girls
giles
anya
xander
willow
and
tara
run
in
to
fit
in
in
this
glittering
world
sweet
watching
listening
don't
give
me
songs
giles
speaks
she
needs
backup
anya
tara
don't
give
me
songs
anya
and
tara
take
up
positions
behind
buffy
to
be
her
backup
singers
and
dancers
the
three
of
them
move
in
sync
give
me
something
to
sing
about
ahhhhh
i
need
something
to
sing
about
ahhhhh
more
dancing
the
hardrock
beat
returns
the
girls
dance
to
it
for
a
minute
then
return
to
the
first
dance
and
the
ballad
life's
a
song
you
don't
get
to
rehearse
and
every
single
verse
can
make
it
that
much
worse
anya
and
tara
stop
dancing
move
to
background
buffy
puts
up
a
hand
as
if
to
shield
herself
from
the
sight
of
her
friends
still
my
friends
don't
know
why
i
ignore
the
million
things
or
more
i
should
be
dancing
for
back
to
the
hardrock
tune
buffy
continues
dancing
alone
all
the
joy
life
sends
family
and
friends
all
the
twists
and
bends
knowing
that
it
ends
well
that
depends
back
to
the
ballad
melody
on
if
they
let
you
go
buffy
looking
around
at
the
scoobies
on
if
they
know
enough
to
know
buffy
walking
up
the
steps
to
the
stage
that
when
you've
bowed
you
leave
the
crowd
she
walks
up
onto
the
stage
looks
back
at
the
others
then
at
sweet
still
sitting
he
makes
his
stringpulling
gesture
buffy
walks
right
up
to
him
there
was
no
pain
no
fear
no
doubt
till
they
pulled
me
out
of
heaven
buffy
looks
back
at
the
others
giles
and
xander
looking
surprised
so
that's
my
refrain
willow
looking
horrified
i
live
in
hell
xander
looking
horrified
'cause
i've
been
expelled
from
heaven
i
think
i
was
in
heaven
willow
looking
horrified
so
give
me
something
to
sing
about
buffy
whirls
around
to
look
at
sweet
please
give
me
something
sweet
shakes
his
head
buffy
gives
a
desperate
look
turns
and
flips
off
the
stage
onto
the
floor
the
hardrock
tune
returns
with
the
electric
guitars
playing
a
wild
riff
buffy
dances
faster
and
faster
dawn
watches
in
dismay
sweet
leans
forward
expectantly
buffy
spins
wildly
round
and
round
and
round
smoke
begins
to
curl
off
her
suddenly
spike
appears
stops
her
by
grabbing
her
upper
arms
buffy
gives
him
a
desperate
unhappy
look
life's
not
a
song
life
isn't
bliss
life
is
just
this
it's
living
spike
brushes
hair
back
from
her
face
you'll
get
along
dawn
stands
up
the
pain
that
you
feel
you
only
can
heal
by
living
buffy
looks
about
to
cry
you
have
to
go
one
living
so
one
of
us
is
living
buffy
stares
at
spike
dawn
walks
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
stage
dawn
speaks
the
hardest
thing
in
this
world
is
to
live
in
it
buffy
looks
at
dawn
then
back
at
spike
shot
of
tara
trying
to
comfort
willow
last
few
chords
end
of
song
life's
a
show
sweet
applauds
now
that
was
a
showstopping
number
buffy
and
spike
turning
to
look
at
him
not
quite
the
fireworks
that
i
was
looking
for
get
out
of
here
mm
i
smell
power
sweet
stands
i
guess
the
little
missus
and
i
should
be
on
our
way
dawn
backing
away
from
him
in
fear
sitting
back
down
that's
never
going
to
happen
sweet
chuckling
i
don't
make
the
rules
she
summoned
me
dawn
to
sweet
i
so
did
not
dawn
to
others
he
keeps
saying
that
you
have
my
talisman
on
sweet
thing
sweet
reaches
to
touch
the
necklace
dawn
is
wearing
she
cringes
in
fear
cowers
away
from
him
dawn
very
nervous
oh
but
no
i
i
um
uh
this
at
at
the
magic
box
on
the
floor
i
was
i
was
cleaning
and
i
forgot
but
i
didn't
summon
anything
well
now
that's
a
twist
if
it
was
in
the
shop
then
one
of
us
probably
beat
they
all
look
around
at
each
other
slowly
xander
raises
his
hand
xander
well
i
didn't
know
what
was
gonna
happen
i
just
thought
there
were
gonna
be
dances
and
songs
xander
to
anya
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
we'd
we'd
work
out
xander
nervous
smile
get
a
happy
ending
sweet
chuckling
i
think
everything
worked
out
just
fine
does
this
mean
that
i
have
to
xander
gulp
be
your
queen
anya
looks
anxious
it's
tempting
xander
looking
apprehensive
but
i
think
we'll
waive
that
clause
just
this
once
xander
is
intensely
relieved
everyone
else
just
continues
watching
sweet
big
smiles
everyone
you
beat
the
bad
guy
he
does
a
quick
spin
song
see
you
in
hell
begins
what
a
lot
of
fun
you
guys
have
been
real
swell
sweet
chuckles
begins
dancing
and
there's
not
a
one
who
can
say
this
ended
well
buffy
and
spike
watching
all
those
secrets
you've
been
concealing
willow
tara
giles
and
xander
watching
say
you're
happy
now
once
more
with
feeling
now
i
gotta
run
see
you
all
he
turns
into
a
ball
of
light
that
swirls
around
their
heads
leaving
a
sparkly
trail
they
watch
it
go
in
heeeeeeell
end
of
song
see
you
in
hell
everyone
stands
around
looking
kind
of
shellshocked
dawn
walks
across
the
stage
in
foreground
with
the
others
in
background
song
where
do
we
go
from
here
begins
where
do
we
go
from
here
dawn
walks
to
the
steps
and
down
where
do
we
go
from
here
the
battle's
done
and
we
kind
of
won
so
we
sound
our
victory
cheer
where
do
we
go
from
here
why
is
the
path
unclear
when
we
know
home
is
near
they
all
move
to
stand
in
a
line
sidebyside
understand
we'll
go
hand
in
hand
all
join
hands
but
we'll
walk
alone
in
fear
all
release
hands
and
walk
off
in
different
directions
tell
me
where
do
we
go
from
here
when
does
the
end
appear
they
all
make
a
dance
gesture
with
their
arms
close
on
spike
in
the
middle
of
singing
appear
he
suddenly
stops
scoffs
puts
his
arm
down
spike
speaks
bugger
this
spike
turns
and
leaves
the
song
continues
without
him
when
do
the
trumpets
cheer
the
curtains
close
on
a
kiss
god
knows
cut
to
outside
spike
exits
and
begins
walking
down
the
street
all
faintly
we
can
tell
the
end
is
near
buffy
comes
out
of
the
bronze
after
spike
buffy
speaks
hey
all
faintly
where
do
we
go
from
here
end
of
song
where
do
we
go
from
here
spike
speaks
you
should
go
back
inside
finish
the
big
group
sing
get
your
kumbayayas
out
i
don't
want
to
spike
sighs
the
day
you
suss
out
what
you
do
want
there'll
probably
be
a
parade
seventysix
bloody
trombones
spike
look
you
don't
have
to
say
anything
buffy
sings
i
touch
the
fire
and
it
freezes
me
spike
looks
surprised
they
walk
toward
each
other
spike
sings
i
died
i
look
into
it
and
it's
black
this
isn't
real
but
i
just
want
to
feel
so
many
years
ago
but
you
can
make
me
feel
as
they
hold
the
last
note
on
feel
they
walk
right
up
to
each
other
they
finish
the
song
and
kiss
passionately
all
singing
where
do
we
go
from
here
the
words
the
end
flash
on
the
screen
then
an
image
of
curtains
that
draw
closed
over
buffy
and
spike
as
they
continue
kissing
blackout
