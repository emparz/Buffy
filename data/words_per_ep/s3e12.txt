prologue

angel's
mansion
the
lights
are
low
the
logs
in
the
fireplace
are
burning
steadily
candles
are
lit
throughout
the
room
the
camera
pans
across
a
blanket
upon
which
are
the
remains
of
a
cozy
picnic
dinner
suddenly
buffy
hits
the
floor
in
front
of
the
fireplace
hard
on
her
back
she
has
her
right
knee
pulled
up
to
her
chest
angel
crouches
over
her
holding
himself
up
with
his
arms
and
grinning
down
at
her
she
uses
her
leg
to
throw
angel
over
her
head
he
flips
backward
and
lands
flat
on
his
back
buffy
does
a
kickup
bringing
her
up
to
a
standing
position
and
spins
around
to
face
angel
as
he
gets
to
his
feet
he
hesitates
for
a
moment
before
lunging
at
her
with
a
wide
punch
that
she
easily
ducks
she
comes
up
behind
him
and
he
turns
around
to
face
her
he
tries
a
lefthand
punch
but
she
inner
form
blocks
it
and
flies
into
a
halfspinning
intoout
crescent
kick
angel
ducks
it
but
gets
knocked
off
his
feet
when
buffy
keeps
on
spinning
downwards
with
a
back
leg
sweep
sending
him
to
the
floor
she
scrambles
to
grab
a
baguette
from
the
blanket
and
rolls
toward
angel
she
comes
up
straddling
him
at
the
waist
and
plunges
the
long
thin
loaf
at
his
chest
stopping
just
short
of
penetration
gotcha
angel
defeated
uhh
right
in
the
heart
buffy
smiling
satisfied
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
word
buffy
taken
aback
okay
she
sets
aside
the
baguette
stands
up
and
takes
a
few
steps
away
i
didn't
mean
'satisfied'
like
he
grabs
the
baguette
and
gets
up
also
no
i
i
wasn't
trying
to
buffy
awkwardly
'cause
we're
not
having
satisfaction
in
the
personal
sense
of
course
angel
exhales
buffy
smiles
i
should
go
buffy
walks
past

'daddy'
angel
smiles
huh

father
angel
frowns
it
is
your
father
right
she
gives
him
a
big
reassuring
grin
and
nods
he's
taking
me
to
the
ice
show
buffy
angel
sighs
with
relief
which
should
be
big
fun
i
could
use
a
little
fun
cut
to
the
library
buffy
is
sitting
at
the
table
while
giles
dangles
a
pink
crystal
in
front
of
her
she
plays
with
a
long
thin
translucent
one
there
is
a
rather
large
collection
of
crystals
of
various
colors
shapes
and
sizes
on
the
table
this
one
amethyst
used
for
breath
mints
buffy
looks
up
at
him
giles
exasperated
charm
bags
money
spells
and
for
cleansing
one's
aura
okay
so
how
do
you
know
if
one's
aura's
dirty
somebody
come
by
with
a
finger
and
write
buffy
gestures
with
her
crystal
'wash
me'
on
it
giles
sets
down
his
crystal
takes
off
his
glasses
and
props
his
arms
on
the
table
leaning
toward
buffy
giles
seriously
buffy
i'm
aware
of
your
distaste
for
studying
vibratory
stones
but
since
it
is
part
of
your
training
i
would
appreciate
your
glibfree
attention
sorry
it's
just
with
faith
on
one
of
her
unannounced
walkabouts
i
feel
like
somebody
should
be
patrolling
giles
looks
over
the
crystals
well
faith
is
not
interested
in
proper
training
so
i
must
rely
on
you
to
keep
up
with
yours
i
hate
being
the
good
one
and
as
for
patrolling
well
you'll
be
there
soon
enough
giles
suddenly
curious
why
so
anxious
i
guess
it
buffy
suddenly
selfconscious
about
her
crystal
quickly
puts
it
down
i
just
have
some
energy
to
burn
well
in
due
time
giles
puts
his
glasses
on
but
uh
for
the
present
giles
selects
the
largest
blue
crystal
if
it's
not
entirely
beyond
your
capabilities
giles
sets
it
in
front
of
buffy
try
to
concentrate
buffy
sighs
and
stares
into
the
crystal
cut
to
a
playground
later
that
night
a
vampire
front
rolls
down
the
slide
and
onto
the
ground
buffy
runs
down
the
slide
after
him
and
stops
next
to
him
in
a
ready
stance
wow
that
was
really
funnylooking
buffy
grins
widely
could
you
do
it
again
i'll
kill
you
for
that
vampire
jumps
up
for
that
what
were
you
trying
to
kill
me
for
before
the
vampire
swings
at
her
but
she
ducks
it
and
comes
up
behind
him
he
faces
her
just
in
time
to
take
a
roundhouse
kick
in
the
shoulder
he
swings
again
but
she
ducks
it
and
punches
him
in
the
gut
then
rises
back
up
and
backhand
punches
him
in
the
head
then
she
shoves
him
back
a
step
so
she
can
follow
up
with
a
halfspinning
wheel
kick
making
the
vampire
stumble
back
and
fall
onto
the
carousel
she
strides
toward
him
okay
so
here's
the
deal
buffy
raises
her
stake
suddenly
she
is
overcome
by
dizziness
she
closes
her
eyes
and
steps
back
unsteadily
almost
as
though
in
pain
the
vampire
seizes
the
opening
and
rushes
her
grabs
her
by
the
jacket
swings
her
around
and
throws
her
onto
a
picnic
table
she
rolls
off
of
it
and
onto
the
ground
the
vampire
jumps
on
top
of
her
straddling
her
she
turns
her
head
away
in
fright
he
grabs
her
right
wrist
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
grabs
her
hand
and
twists
it
around
hurting
her
and
making
her
cry
out
her
stake
is
now
pointed
at
her
own
chest
and
the
vampire
uses
his
weight
to
slowly
push
it
down
at
her
lemme
know
if
i'm
not
doing
this
right
her
eyes
go
wide
with
terror
as
she
struggles
desperately
with
him
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

the
playground
the
vampire
straddling
buffy
leans
hard
on
the
stake
slowly
pushing
it
closer
to
buffy's
chest
she
struggles
hard
to
keep
him
at
bay
but
she's
losing
the
battle
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
get
him
off
of
her
she
head
butts
the
vampire
he
is
slightly
stunned
and
stops
pushing
down
on
the
stake
but
remains
on
top
of
her
she
then
slaps
him
in
the
face
hard
and
shoves
him
off
of
her
he
rolls
away
and
onto
all
fours
buffy
scrambles
to
get
the
stake
rolls
back
onto
her
back
and
braces
the
stake
against
her
chest
pointing
upward
the
vampire
jumps
to
his
feet
and
lunges
angrily
for
her
landing
on
top
of
her
and
impaling
himself
he
explodes
into
a
cloud
of
ashes
buffy
waits
a
moment
before
she
raises
herself
into
a
sitting
position
she
brushes
some
of
the
dust
from
her
jacket
and
takes
a
few
breaths
before
standing
up
cut
to
sunnydale
high
the
next
morning
cut
to
the
library
buffy
stands
by
the
table
concentrating
on
a
target
she
set
up
against
the
railing
of
the
stack
level
she
raises
a
knife
and
throws
it
it
glances
off
of
the
target
and
clinks
as
it
hits
the
floor
giles
comes
into
the
library
with
his
briefcase
and
a
cup
of
coffee
and
heads
toward
his
office
bit
early
in
the
day
giles
sips
his
coffee
giles
something's
wrong
giles
stops
wrong
he
sees
the
target
with
a
few
knives
stuck
awkwardly
into
it
none
of
them
are
anywhere
near
the
center
ah

you
shouldn't
giles
buffy
throws
a
knife
and
misses
do
that
anymore
sets
down
his
briefcase
on
top
of
that
i

a
bad
case
of
the
dizzies
last
night
and
almost
let
a
vamp
stake
me
with
my
own
stake

country
it's
in
cuernavaca
giles

i
can't
get
sick
my
dad's
coming
to
take
me
to
the
ice
show

break
his
heart

he

and
goes
to

his
briefcase
buffy
picks
up
a
couple
more
knives
from
the
table

a
little
more
time
training
she
throws
one
this
time
it
goes
very
wild
and
breaks
one
of
the
reading
lamps
giles
didn't
see
it
but
he
sure
heard
it
i'm
gone
buffy
turns
and
leaves
thank
you
he
goes
into
his
office
without
looking
at
the
damage
cut
outside
to
the
lunch
tables
oz
xander
willow
and
buffy
are
eating
an
ice
show
a
show
performed
on
ice
and
how
old
are
we
again
i
went
to
snoopy
on
ice
when
i
was
little
my
dad
took
me
backstage
and
i
got
so
scared
i
threw
up
on
woodstock
look
i
know
you
guys
think
it's
just
a
big
dumb
girlie
thing
but
it's
not
i
mean
a
lot
of
those
skaters
are
olympic
medal
winners
and
every
year
my
dad
buys
me
cotton
candy
and
one
of
those
souvenir
programs
that
has
all
the
pictures
and
okay
it's
a
big
dumb
girlie
thing
but
i
love
it
it's
not
so
girlie
ice
is
cool
it's
water
but
it's
not
i
think
it's
sweet
you
and
your
dad
have
a
tradition
especially
now
that
he's
not
around
so
much
ix
nay
on
the
caramel
corn
though
if
you
go
backstage
buffy
nods
in
agreement
we're
still
talking
party
right
i
mean
some
of
us
still
love
to
relish
celebrating
in
the
birth
of
the
buff
i
dunno
i
think
it
might
be
time
to
put
a
moratorium
on
parties
in
my
honor
they
tend
to
go
badly
monsters
crash
people
die
but
eighteen
is
a
big
one
buffy
i
mean
you
can
vote
now
you
can
be
drafted
willow
smiles
you
can
vote
not
to
be
drafted
i
think
i'll
choose
to
celebrate
this
one
with
quiet
reflection
where
is
it
written
that
quiet
reflection
can't
be
combined
with
cake
and
funny
hats
cut
to
the
kitchen
at
buffy's
house
a
large
birthday
floral
arrangement
is
on
the
island
complete
with
helium
balloon
and
card
the
tickets
to
the
ice
show
are
attached
to
the
card
joyce
is
at
the
stove
making
dinner
she
hears
the
front
door
close
buffy
present
she
comes
into
the
kitchen
sees
the
flowers
and
smiles
ooo
present
uh
they're
not
they're
from
your
father
buffy
takes
the
card
and
tickets
from
the
arrangement
and
looks
at
them
her
expression
shows
deep
disappointment
his
uh
quarterly
projections
are
unraveling
and
he
can't
afford
to
take
off
right
now
he
promises
to
make
it
up
to
you
it's
all
right
there
in
the
letter
buffy
sadly
folds
up
the
tickets
and
the
card
without
even
opening
it
iif
you
want
i
could
ask
somebody
to
cover
for
me
at
the
gallery
ii
mean
if
you
want
me
to
take
you
no
no
that's
not
necessary
ii
was
just
thinking
it
might
be
nice
to
have
a
quiet
birthday
cut
to
an
abandoned
boardinghouse
the
sign
outside
reads
sunnydale
arms
rooms
for
let
breakfast
included
inquire
within
cut
inside
the
place
is
dark
and
musty
a
few
of
the
wall
lamps
are
lit
and
there's
a
fire
going
in
the
fireplace
it's
clear
though
that
no
one
has
lived
here
for
years
the
furniture
is
torn
and
the
books
on
the
shelves
are
strewn
about
a
man
is
bricking
shut
one
of
the
windows
quentin
travers
a
member
of
the
watcher's
council
observes
his
progress
he
turns
as
another
man
comes
down
the
stairs
how
much
longer
hobson
five
maybe
six
hours
sir
they
slowly
walk
into
the
next
room
once
you
finish
you
and
blair
can
get
some
rest
but
sleep
in
shifts
he
and
hobson
stop
and
look
across
the
room
there
stands
a
tall
wooden
crate
with
a
heavy
lock
on
it
we're
getting
very
close
the
slayer's
preparation
is
nearly
complete
cut
to
the
library
giles
gets
out
the
crystals
again
and
carefully
lays
them
out
on
the
table
buffy
sits
and
watches
him
you
know
it's
not
just
cartoon
characters
they
do
pieces
from
operas
and
ballets
brian
boitano
doing
carmen
is
a
life
changer
oh
he
doesn't
actually
play
carmen
but
a
lot
of
sophisticated
people
go
giles
absently
yes
i
think
we
should
start
with
the
grounding
crystal
again
he
sets
the
largest
blue
crystal
on
the
table
in
front
of
buffy
you
know
it's
usually
something
that
families
do
together
he
absently
sets
the
box
aside
now
look
very
carefully
for
the
tiny
flaw
at
its
core
iif
someone
were
free
they'd
take
their
daughters
or
their
student
or
their
slayer
buffy
looks
up
at
him
hopefully
hmm
yes
but
buffy
i
think
we
should
concentrate
now
now
look
for
the
flaw
at
its
center
he
leans
against
the
table
buffy
gives
in
and
starts
to
concentrate
on
the
crystal
at
its
center
is
a
small
stakeshaped
flaw
in
an
otherwise
nearly
clear
blue
crystal
faint
wind
chimes
can
be
heard
as
buffy
slowly
goes
into
a
trance
giles
leans
over
further
and
looks
into
her
face
buffy
satisfied
that
she
is
caught
in
the
crystal's
thrall
he
pulls
a
small
case
from
his
briefcase
sets
it
on
the
table
and
opens
it
inside
is
a
hypodermic
needle
a
test
tube
full
of
a
clear
yellow
liquid
and
an
alcoholsoaked
gauze
pad
keeping
a
careful
eye
on
buffy
he
takes
the
pad
and
leans
toward
her
he
takes
her
arm
pushes
up
her
sleeve
and
wipes
the
pad
on
a
spot
near
the
inside
of
her
elbow
he
fills
the
syringe
taps
it
to
get
any
air
bubbles
to
the
tip
and
pushes
on
the
plunger
until
the
fluid
begins
to
squirt
out
again
he
checks
to
be
sure
buffy
is
under
then
he
takes
her
arm
in
one
hand
and
with
the
other
sticks
in
the
needle
slowly
he
depresses
the
plunger
all
the
while
keeping
an
eye
on
his
charge
she
doesn't
stir
in
the
least
he
pulls
the
needle
back
out
buffy
does
not
bleed
from
the
site
quickly
he
puts
everything
away
buffy
remains
in
the
crystal's
thrall
giles
sits
on
the
table
trying
to
be
casual
and
waves
his
hand
between
buffy
and
the
crystal
she
comes
out
of
her
trance
and
looks
up
at
him
oh
i'm
sorry
buffy
rubs
her
temples
did
i
zone
out
on
you
it's
just
i'm
nursing
that
flu
bug
it's
best
to
take
care
of
that
perhaps
we
should
um
call
it
a
night
yeah
buffy
exhales
that's
a
good
idea
thanks
she
gets
up
weakly
and
groans
as
she
walks
out
of
the
library
giles
smiles
to
himself
good
night

at
the
bronze
all
night
and
the
big
deal
is
you
made
me
look
like
some
kind
of
dork
in
front
of
my
posse
he
grabs
her
arm
cordelia
is
offended
and
slaps
his
arm
away
first
of
all
'posse'
passe'
second
of
all
anyone
with
a
teaspoon
of
brains
knows
not
to
take
my
flirting
seriously
especially
with
my
extenuating
circumstances
boy
confused
what
circumstances
rebound
look
it
up
she
tries
to
leave
but
he
grabs
her
by
both
shoulders
and
pushes
her
against
a
tree
hey
i'm
not
through
here
buffy
immediately
moves
in
and
grabs
the
boy's
arm
oh
i
beg
to
differ
she
tries
to
yank
at
it
but
finds
she
has
absolutely
no
strength
he
scoffs
at
her
and
nudges
her
away
rather
hard
buffy
falls
backward
stumbling
onto
a
bench
and
rolls
off
onto
the
ground
cordelia
is
incensed
and
shoves
him
away
from
her
what
is
wrong
with
you
ow
she
starts
pounding
him
in
the
chest
with
girlie
punches
he
quickly
backs
away
but
cordelia
keeps
up
with
him
and
won't
let
up
god
the
chick
started
it
willow
gets
down
to
her
knees
to
help
buffy
up
willow
very
concerned
are
you
okay
buffy
slowly
sits
up
very
confused
cut
to
the
hall
giles
is
heading
toward
the
library
with
a
stack
of
magazines
buffy
catches
up
with
him
okay
i
just
got
swatted
down
by
some
noneck
and
rescued
by
cordelia
what
the
hell
is
happening
i'm
sure
it'll
sort
itself
out
buffy
desperate
to
know
you're
not
getting
the
big
picture
here
ii
have
no
strength
i
have
no
coordination
i
throw
knives
like
giles
calmly
a
girl
buffy
confused
by
his
reaction
like
i'm
not
the
slayer
look
buffy
i
i
i
assure
you
um
given
time
wwwe'll
get
to
the
bottom
of
of
whatever's
causing
this
um
anomaly
promise
me
yes
i
give
you
my
word
he
heads
down
the
hall
for
his
library
you're
having
doubts
cut
inside
the
boardinghouse
he
and
giles
are
sharing
a
cup
of
tea
cruciamentum
is
not
easy
for
slayer
or
watcher
but
it's
been
done
this
way
for
a
dozen
centuries
whenever
a
slayer
turns
eighteen
it's
a
timehonored
rite
of
passage
it's
an
archaic
exercise
in
cruelty
to
lock
her
in
this
tomb
weakened
defenseless
looks
at
the
crate
behind
him
and
to
unleash
that
on
her
he
stares
at
the
crate
in
the
other
room
for
a
long
moment
before
turning
back
to
quentin
if
any
one
of
the
council
still
had
actual
contact
with
a
slayer
they
would
see
but
i'm
the
one
in
the
thick
of
it
which
is
why
you're
not
qualified
to
make
this
decision
you're
too
close
that's
not
true
a
slayer
is
not
just
physical
prowess
she
must
have
cunning
imagination
a
confidence
derived
from
selfreliance
and
believe
me
once
this
is
all
over
your
buffy
will
be
stronger
for
it
or
she'll
be
dead
for
it
cut
to
later
hobson
is
working
on
the
front
door
he
stops
for
a
moment
when
quentin
and
giles
approach
and
lets
them
go
through
rupert
if
this
girl
is
everything
you
say
then
you've
nothing
to
worry
about
giles
isn't
so
sure
he
puts
on
his
glasses
and
leaves
without
saying
a
word
hobson
to
quentin
uh
sir
if
you
can
spare
me
for
a
short
spell
i'll
need
to
make
a
run
to
the
hardware
store
i
just
need
some
he
is
interrupted
by
loud
screaming
coming
from
inside
the
crate
blair
hears
it
too
and
comes
in
from
another
room
take
care
of
it
the
two
men
reluctantly
go
to
the
crate
quentin
slowly
follows
them
whatever's
inside
the
crate
keeps
screaming
its
head
off
cut
to
the
crate
blair
opens
the
lock
and
removes
it
he
pulls
open
the
latch
and
jerks
open
the
crate
inside
is
a
very
angry
vampire
secured
in
a
straightjacket
and
strapped
to
the
back
of
the
crate
with
a
metal
band
across
his
forehead
the
two
men
nervously
stare
at
the
vampire
quentin
impatient
come
on
come
on
blair
steps
over
to
a
table
and
pulls
two
pills
from
a
bottle
he
puts
them
on
a
spoon
that's
been
tied
to
a
long
bar
hobson
stands
behind
him
with
a
glass
of
water
also
on
the
end
of
a
long
bar
blair
reaches
the
spoon
up
to
the
vampire's
mouth
kralik
your
pills
open
your
mouth
the
vampire
opens
its
mouth
just
enough
and
blair
nudges
the
spoon
in
turning
it
to
drop
the
pills
in
then
quickly
retreats
hobson
steps
up
with
the
glass
of
water
and
angles
it
for
kralik
to
drink
he
gulps
deeply
some
of
the
water
spills
to
the
sides
of
his
mouth
that's
enough
close
it
up
hobson
backs
away
and
blair
slams
the
crate
shut
cut
to
the
library
the
gang
is
at
the
table
doing
research
into
buffy's
condition
aha
a
curse
on
slayers
buffy
looks
up
willow
reads
again
oh
no
wait
iit's
lawyers
you
know
maybe
we're
on
the
wrong
track
with
the
whole
spell
curse
and
whammy
thing
maybe
what
we
should
be
looking
for
is
something
like
um
xander
ahem
slayer
kryptonite
faulty
metaphor
kryptonite
kills
you're
assuming
i
meant
the
green
kryptonite
i
was
referring
of
course
to
the
red
kryptonite
which
drains
superman
of
his
powers
oz
thinks
wrong
the
gold
kryptonite's
the
powersucker
the
red
kryptonite
mutates
superman
into
some
sort
of
weird
buffy
impatiently
guys
reality
she
drops
her
book
onto
the
table
gets
up
and
walks
toward
the
stairs
willow
gets
up
and
follows
buffy
willow
they
stop
i
know
you
are
definitely
without
a
doubt
gonna
get
your
powers
back
thanks
will
buffy
starts
up
to
the
stacks
but
what
if
you
don't
buffy
stops
okay
buffy
sighs
if
i
don't
get
my
powers
back
then
i
don't
i'll
deal
buffy
considers
and
there's
a
whole
lotta
good
sides
to
it
actually
this
could
open
up
so
many
giles
comes
into
the
library
buffy
runs
up
to
him
giles
did
you
find
anything
giles
apologetically
uh
no

cut
to
the
boardinghouse
hobson
comes
into
the
room
where
he
and
blair
have
set
up
their
cots
he
has
just
sat
down
on
his
when
kralik
begins
to
thrash
and
scream
in
his
crate
blair
wakes
and
sits
bolt
upright
they
both
take
deep
breaths
when
they
realize
he's
not
loose
it's
your
shift
blair
gets
up
and
goes
to
take
care
of
their
charge
pulling
the
door
to
their
room
closed
behind
him
as
hobson
lies
down
for
a
rest
cut
to
the
crate
blair
pulls
it
open
kralik
is
still
tied
up
inside
pills
blair
nervously
yes
he
looks
over
at
the
pill
bottle
and
sees
that
there's
no
water
in
the
glass
he
takes
it
and
quickly
goes
to
the
kitchen
kralik
takes
a
deep
breath
and
strains
against
the
straightjacket
screaming
very
loudly
the
seam
on
his
right
shoulder
tears
in
the
kitchen
blair
fills
the
glass
and
casts
a
worried
look
behind
him
it's
coming
he
turns
off
the
water
and
runs
back
to
the
crate
kralik
lifts
his
shoulder
to
make
the
tear
in
the
seam
less
conspicuous
pills
blair
sets
down
the
water
gets
two
pills
from
the
bottle
and
puts
them
on
the
spoon
he
holds
it
up
to
kralik's
mouth
as
the
vampire
continues
to
groan
loudly
crushing
his
eyelids
shut
and
panting
in
apparent
pain
take
them
pills
they're
right
in
front
of
you
kralik
sniffs
where
kralik
sniffs
here
i
can't
see
can't
kralik
sticks
out
his
tongue
can't
reach
it
blair
takes
a
careful
step
closer
open
your
eyes
kralik
suddenly
thrusts
out
his
arm
and
grabs
blair
by
the
neck
lifting
him
from
the
floor
and
choking
him
shh
everything's
okay
now
cut
to
angel's
mansion
the
fire
is
going
nicely
the
camera
pulls
back
to
show
buffy
and
angel
sitting
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
fireplace
buffy
unwraps
a
book
angel's
birthday
gift
to
her
she
opens
it
and
leafs
through
it
it's
a
copy
of
sonnets
from
the
portuguese
classic
love
poems
by
elizabeth
barrett
browning
to
her
husband
robert
browning
on
the
title
page
angel
has
written
simply
always
buffy
softly
thank
you
that's
beautiful
you
really
like
it
of
course
i
do
it's
sweet
and
thoughtful
and
full
of
neat
words
to
learn
and
say
like
'wilt'
and
'henceforth'
then
why'd
you
seem
more
excited
last
year
when
you
got
a
severed
arm
in
a
box
i'm
sorry
uh
it's
just
suddenly
there's
this
chance
that
my
calling's
a
wrong
number
and
it's
just
freaking
me
out
a
little
that's
understandable
angel
what
if
i
have
lost
my
power
you
lived
a
long
time
without
it
you
can
do
it
again
i
guess
but
what
if
i
can't
i've
seen
too
much
i
know
what
goes
bump
in
the
night
not
being
able
to
fight
it
what
if
i
just
hide
under
my
bed
all
scared
and
helpless
or
what
if
i
just
become
pathetic
hanging
out
at
the
old
slayer's
home
talking
people's
ears
off
about
my
glory
days
showing
them
mr
pointy
the
stake
i
had
bronzed
buffy
you
could
never
be
helpless
or
boring
not
even
if
you
tried
buffy
raises
her
eyebrows
and
gets
up
don't
be
so
sure
she
steps
over
to
a
table
before
i
was
the
slayer
i
was
buffy
leans
on
the
table
well
i
i
don't
wanna
say
shallow
but
let's
say
a
certain
person
who
will
remain
nameless
we'll
just
call
her
spordelia
looked
like
a
classical
philosopher
next
to
me
angel
if
i'm
not
the
slayer
what
do
i
do
what
do
i
have
to
offer
why
would
you
like
me
angel
quietly
i
saw
you
before
you
became
the
slayer
buffy
confused
what
i
watched
you
and
i
saw
you
called
it
was
a
bright
afternoon
out
in
front
of
your
school
you
walked
down
the
steps
and
and
i
loved
you
why
'cause
i
could
see
your
heart
angel
gets
up
you
held
it
before
you
for
everyone
to
see
angel
walks
to
her
and
i
worried
that
it
would
be
bruised
or
torn
and
more
than
anything
in
my
life
i
wanted
to
keep
it
safe
to
warm
it
with
my
own
buffy
looks
up
into
his
eyes
for
a
long
moment
then
leans
into
him
and
they
embrace
holding
each
other
close
that's
beautiful
or
taken
literally
incredibly
gross
angel
grimacing
i
was
just
thinking
that
too
cut
to
the
boardinghouse
although
kralik
has
his
arm
free
he's
still
tied
too
well
to
free
himself
from
the
straightjacket
no
matter
though
seeing
as
blair
is
lying
in
front
of
him
soon
to
become
a
vampire
kralik
idly
hums
and
licks
his
fingers
while
he
waits
for
his
new
friend
to
wake
he
watches
as
blair's
face
spontaneously
morphs
into
a
vampire's
blair
stirs
turns
his
head
to
see
where
the
humming
is
coming
from
and
slowly
gets
to
his
feet
ah
you're
up
i
was
afraid
i
drained
you
too
much
i
do
that
sometimes
blair
growls
at
kralik
but
knows
what
he
must
do
he
looks
around
for
the
ax
he
knows
should
be
there
ever
have
a
tune
you
can't
get
outta
your
head
it
keeps
playing
over
and
over
and
over
drives
me
nuts
blair
brings
the
ax
over
and
swings
it
at
the
metal
strap
where
it's
attached
to
the
crate
on
the
left
side
of
kralik's
head
then
on
the
right
the
strap
falls
to
the
floor
and
kralik
steps
out
ahh
thank
you
he
grunts
as
he
pulls
the
straightjacket
off
his
other
arm
and
lets
it
fall
ohh
that
is
much
better
he
goes
over
to
his
pill
bottle
and
pops
a
couple
into
his
mouth
then
picks
up
the
glass
of
water
and
steps
back
over
to
blair
mmm
he
takes
a
good
swallow
of
the
water
it's
a
game
you
know
we're
not
gonna
play
by
their
rules
but
that
doesn't
mean
we're
not
gonna
play
he
smiles
broadly
and
downs
the
rest
of
the
water
mmm
kralik
points
at
hobson's
room
why
don't
you
call
your
friend
in
we'll
discuss
it
over
dinner
part
3

the
boardinghouse
later
that
night
giles
opens
the
door
and
takes
a
tentative
look
inside
everything
seems
quiet
quentin
he
steps
in
and
closes
the
door
still
wary
of
the
place
he
goes
into
the
sitting
room
nothing
seems
amiss
he
walks
back
out
and
down
the
hall
looking
up
the
stairs
still
all
seems
well
but
it's
just
too
quiet
he
takes
a
few
steps
up
to
the
landing
hello
quentin
hob
he
notices
that
the
stair
railing
feels
clammy
and
looks
at
his
hand
it's
covered
with
fresh
blood
from
the
landing
he
looks
into
the
other
room
and
sees
the
closed
crate
standing
there
he
rushes
down
the
stairs
and
looks
for
a
weapon
he
grabs
one
of
the
stair
rail
supports
and
breaks
it
out
with
the
heel
of
his
other
hand
he
heads
straight
for
the
crate
intending
to
dust
whatever's
inside
but
finds
it
empty
alarmed
he
looks
around
and
then
down
at
the
floor
there
he
sees
tracks
of
blood
leading
into
the
kitchen
he
follows
them
ready
for
anything
holding
his
makeshift
stake
up
and
ready
he
grabs
the
doorknob
and
swings
it
open
but
nothing
is
there
to
meet
him
he
searches
for
the
light
switch
first
on
one
side
then
the
other
and
flips
it
on
when
he
finds
it
he
sees
what's
left
of
hobson
lying
on
the
table
the
camera
only
shows
his
arm
but
the
mauling
hobson
received
must
have
been
horrific
because
giles
immediately
drops
the
stake
backs
out
of
the
kitchen
puts
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
does
his
best
not
to
vomit
quickly
he
regains
his
composure
and
makes
tracks
out
of
the
house
cut
to
the
streets
buffy
is
slowly
walking
home
holding
her
coat
closed
and
hugging
her
book
she
watches
as
a
car
passes
and
then
steps
into
the
street
to
cross
it
near
the
other
side
of
the
street
she
walks
past
a
couple
of
guys
just
hanging
out
by
a
car
they
see
her
pass
by
and
check
her
out
man
to
the
other
let's
find
out
man
to
buffy's
back
hey
sweet
girl
man
buffy
stops
cold
how
much
for
a
lap
dance
for
me
and
my
buddy
they
laugh
to
themselves
buffy
begins
to
turn
around
but
thinks
better
of
taking
them
on
in
her
weakened
state
she
continues
along
the
street
the
men
make
no
move
to
follow
her
buffy
wryly
walk
me
home
angel
no
i'm
fine
i
can
take
care
of
myself
she
rounds
a
corner
and
hears
humming
but
doesn't
see
anyone
around
she
stops
and
looks
behind
her
but
sees
no
one
there
either
hummers
big
turnoff
i
like
guys
that
can
remember
the
lyrics
she
starts
to
walk
again
as
she
turns
back
and
runs
right
into
kralik
he
holds
onto
her
by
the
arms
while
she
tries
to
pull
away
you
know
i
wish
i
could
but
my
mind
just
isn't
what
it
used
to
be
let
me
go
she
pulls
harder
and
he
yanks
her
back
kralik
playfully
you
didn't
say
please
she
starts
to
struggle
in
earnest
and
call
for
help
help
me
somebody
please
she
gets
her
left
arm
loose
pulls
her
right
arm
out
of
her
jacket
and
lets
her
left
arm
slip
out
of

blair
catches
up
and
grabs
her
by
the

buffy
slips
through
and
begins
to

looks
over
at
blair
who
couldn't

at

and
screeches
around

grabs
the
door
and
gets
his
feet
up
just
inside
the
car
buffy
hits
him
repeatedly
as
they
speed
along
and
eventually
blair
can't
hold
on
any
longer
he
drops
out
of
the
car
and
rolls
over
a
few
times
in
the

sets
it
in

onto

it's
very
heavy
and
she
has
to
lean
to
the

to
counterbalance
it
as

kralik
chuckles
i'm
aware
of
that
cut

opens
quietly
and
buffy
looks
in
she
has
her
crossbow
up
and
ready
the
front
rooms
are
empty
and
quiet
so
she
steps
in
she
takes
one
of
her
stakes
and
puts
it
down
between
the
door
and
the
frame
to
keep
it
open
again
she
raises
her
bow
and
looks
around
the
front
rooms
she
steps
in
further
and
looks
through
the
archway
into
the
sitting
room
the
fire
is
going
there
she
walks
once
around
the
room
and
then
sets
her
bag
down
on
the
old
couch
she
continues
to
explore
the
area
quietly
her
fear
and
nervousness
evident
in
her
face
she
approaches
a
door
and
cautiously
takes
hold
of
the
knob
quickly
she
twists
it
and
pulls
the
door
open
only
to
find
that
it's
been
bricked
up
on
the
other
side

closes
it
again

a
long
look

shoves
him
aside
and

into
the
sitting

blair
reaches
for

over
the
back
of
the
couch

jumps
away
and
runs
to
the

by
the

moves
to

bookcase
over
on

on

arm

has
to
hit

several
times
before
he
finally
lets
go
buffy
grabs
her
bag
and
runs
out
of
the
room

stops
in
the
hallway
and
looks
around
somewhere
kralik

and
grabs
her
by
the
throat
buffy
gasps
in
fright
but
doesn't
struggle
why
did
you
come
to
the
dark
of
the
woods
he
yanks
her
bag
out
of
her
hands
and
looks
into
it

a
smaller
bow
several
stakes
and
a
few
knives
to
bring
all
these
sweets
to
grandmother's
house
he
drops
the
bag
and
pulls
her
closer
buffy
surprises
him
by
holding
up
a
cross
he
leaps
back
from
her
in
fear
she
holds
it
out
at
arm's
length
shaking
nervously
kralik
stares
at
her
for
a
while
smiling
evilly
then
suddenly
grabs
her
arm
and
pulls
it
and
the
cross
into
his
chest
there
he
rubs
it
around
and
laughs
as
it
burns
against
his
skin
ohoh
no

just
a
little
lower
kralik
nudges
it
down
right
kralik
inhales
in
ecstasy

kralik
gasps
oooh

very
much
buffy
lets
go
of
the
cross
and
runs
in
terror
kralik
just
smiles
and
watches
her
run
she
runs
into
the
kitchen
and
locks
the
door
hobson's
remains
are
still
there
she
notices
the
body
but
doesn't
have
time
to
really
look
at
it
before
she
is
distracted
by
kralik
pounding
on
the
door
she
runs
to
the
counter
and
rifles
through
the
drawers
looking
for
anything
she
can
use
she
finds
nothing
but
then
looks
up
when
the
pounding
stops
her
breathing
is
shallow
and
panting
with
fear
she
looks
around
again
but
can't
find
anything
of
use
slowly
she
steps
back
to
the
door
and
quietly
opens
it
the
coast
is
clear
so
she
comes
into
the
hall
she
constantly
looks
around
as
she
makes
her
way
toward
the
stairs
when
she's
almost
there
she
makes
a
dash
for
them
and
starts
to
run
up
kralik
punches
his
arm
through
the
railing
and
trips
her
making
her
fall
and
cut
her
forehead
against
the
steps
he
grabs
her
leg
and
pulls
her
down
a
ways
she
struggles
to
get
away
she
grabs
a
broken
piece
of
the
railing
and
stabs
at
his
arm
with
it
he
lets
go
and
decides
to
run
up
the
stairs
after
her
buffy
scrambles
to
her
feet
runs
to
the
top
and
starts
down
the
hall
at
a
bend
in
the
hall
she
stops
and
looks
around
the
hallway
is
empty
so
she
runs
to
the
first
door
it's
locked
so
she
goes
to
the
next
it
opens
and
she
runs
in
slamming
the
door
behind
her
the
room
is
pitch
dark
buffy
searches
around
until
she
finds
a
string
hanging
from
the
ceiling
she
pulls
it
and
the
light
goes
on
she
stares
in
shock
at
the
walls
around
her
they
are
covered
with
polaroids
of
her
mother
she
grabs
one
off
the
wall
to
make
sure
just
then
she
hears
kralik
pounding
at
the
door
he
punches
through
and
reaches
in
searching
for
the
knob
to
unlock
it
she
runs
to
another
door
opens
it
and
runs
out
into
the
hall
just
as
she
reaches
the
end
kralik
steps
out
in
front
of
her
if
you
stray
from
the
path
you
will
lose
your
way
he
reaches
out
and
puts
his
hand
on
her
cheek
she
tries
to
push
him
away
but
he's
too
strong
and
bends
down
toward
her
neck
kralik
reassuringly
i
won't
take
it
all
i
won't
take
it
all
she
strains
hard
to
keep
him
at
bay
suddenly
kralik
has
one
of
his
attacks
he
grabs
his
head
and
begins
to
scream
buffy
tries
to
get
past
him
but
he
shoves
her
into
the
wall
stunning
her
he
pulls
out
his
pill
bottle
and
struggles
to
get
it
open
buffy
regains
her
head
and
grabs
the
bottle
out
of
his
hands
she
runs
down
the
hall
away
from
him
no
no
no
he
has
a
hard
time
coming
after
her
with
the
pain
in
his
head
buffy
reaches
the
far
end
of
the
hall
and
leaps
into
the
laundry
chute
kralik
looks
down
the
chute
and
hears
her
sliding
but
doesn't
follow
instead
he
staggers
back
the
other
way
cut
to
the
basement
buffy
comes
sliding
out
of
the
chute
and
onto
a
table
it
breaks
beneath
her
and
she
falls
to
the
floor
in
a
cloud
of
dust
her
mother
is
there
tied
to
a
chair
and
gagged
and
sees
her
daughter
fall
buffy
buffy
gets
up
and
scrambles
over
to
her
mother
she
tries
to
untie
her
but
can't
joyce
muffled
buffy
we
have
to
get
out
they
hear
pounding
at
the
basement
door
buffy
stops
struggling
with
the
ropes
kralik
smashes
the
door
in
and
comes
running
down
the
stairs
demanding
his
pills
where
are
they
where
are
they
he
runs
into
the
room
and
buffy
fakes
trying
to
get
past
him
and
up
the
stairs
he
grabs
her
and
shoves
her
against
a
wall
he
sees
the
pill
bottle
in
her
hands
and
snatches
it
from
her
he
struggles
with
the
lid
as
he
stumbles
over
to
where
he
sees
a
glass
of
water
near
the
wine
racks
he
gets
the
lid
off
pops
a
couple
of
pills
and
gulps
down
the
water
he
gasps
for
air
and
takes
several
deep
breaths
as
he
begins
to
calm
down
knowing
that
the
medicine
should
soon
take
effect
he
smiles
evilly
over
at
buffy
and
takes
some
forced
steps
in
her
direction
buffy
just
watches
him
come
you
don't
seem
to
understand
your
place
in
all
of
this
do
you
have
any
idea
suddenly
he
realizes
something
is
very
wrong
and
stops
in
his
tracks
oh
my
kralik
looks
down
at
the
glass
in
his
hand
what
have
you
he
begins
to
shake
and
looks
back
up
at
buffy
my
pills
she
pulls
the
nowempty
bottle
of
holy
water
from
her
pocket
and
holds
it
up
for
him
to
see
he
drops
the
glass
and
begins
to
shake
violently
grunting
and
groaning
in
pain
no
no
smoke
begins
to
puff
out
of
his
clothes
buffy
watches
coolly
if
i
was
at
full
slayer
power
i'd
be
punning
right
about
now
no
no
he
screams
loudly
one
final
time
and
then
crumbles
to
ashes
from
the
inside
out
buffy
closes
her
eyes
and
lets
out
a
sigh
of
relief
she
pockets
the
bottle
and
rushes
over
to
her
mother
she
pulls
the
gag
from
her
mouth
and
begins
to
work
on
the
ropes
again
joyce
breathing
heavily
buffy
thank
god
you're
okay
oh
that
man
buffy
straining
i
can't
get
these
they're
too
tight
can't
you
just
she
jerks
in
her
chair
suggesting
that
buffy
just
tear
the
ropes
not
right
now
buffy
looks
around
maybe
there's
some
clippers
around
she
stands
up
to
look
around
when
suddenly
blair
lunges
at
her
giles
is
right
behind
him
oh
buffy
blair
grabs
giles
and
throws
him
against
a
shelf
rack
blair
punches
him
in
the
face
and
in
the
gut
giles
doubles
over
but
thrusts
up
with
his
arm
plunging
a
stake
into
blair's
chest
he
bursts
into
ashes
slowly
giles
straightens
up
he
and
buffy
look
at
each
other
for
a
long
time
congratulations
you
passed
cut
to
the
library
buffy
is
sitting
at
the
table
quentin
stands
calmly
at
the
head
as
he
speaks
giles
leans
in
the
doorway
to
his
office
you
exhibited
extraordinary
courage
and
clearheadedness
in
battle
the
council
is
very
pleased
buffy
deadpan
do
i
get
a
gold
star
i
understand
that
you're
upset
buffy
with
controlled
fury
you
understand
nothing
you
set
that
monster
loose
and
he
came
after
my
mother
you
think
the
test
was
unfair
i
think
you
better
leave
town
before
i
get
my
strength
back
quentin
evenly
we're
not
in
the
business
of
fair
miss
summers
we're
fighting
a
war
you're
waging
a
war
she's
fighting
it
there
is
a
difference
mr
giles
if
you
don't
mind
the
test
is
done
we're
finished
not
quite
she
passed
you
didn't
quentin
faces
him
the
slayer
is
not
the
only
one
who
must
perform
in
this
situation
i've
recommended
to
the
council
and
they've
agreed
that
you
be
relieved
of
your
duties
as
watcher
immediately
you're
fired
giles
taken
aback
on
what
grounds
your
affection
for
your
charge
has
rendered
you
incapable
of
clear
and
impartial
judgment
quentin
buffy
looks
at
giles
you
have
a
father's
love
for
the
child
and
that
is
useless
to
the
cause
quentin
giles
looks
down
it
would
be
best
if
you
had
no
further
contact
with
the
slayer
buffy
breaks
her
stare
and
considers
quentin's
words
giles
with
hostility
i'm
not
going
anywhere
no
well
i
didn't
expect
you
would
adhere
to
that
however
if
you
interfere
with
the
new
watcher
or
countermand
his
authority
in
any
way
you
will
be
dealt
with
are
we
clear
oh
we're
very
clear
quentin
bows
slightly
to
buffy
congratulations
again
she
looks
up
at
him
with
a
stare
of
hatred
buffy
vehemently
bite
me
quentin
chuckles
ruefully
yes
well
colorful
girl
he
turns
and
leaves
the
library
giles
looks
up
again
and
puts
on
his
glasses
he
looks
over
at
buffy
she
gazes
down
into
space
for
a
moment
then
sniffs
and
puts
her
hand
to
her
forehead
she
sniffs
again
reaching
out
for
the
cloth
that's
lying
on
the
table
next
to
a
bowl
of
water
and
picks
it
up
giles
walks
over
to
her
and
puts
his
hand
on
the
cloth
she
lets
him
take
it
from
her
hand
he
dips
it
in
the
water
and
kneels
down
in
front
of
her
reaches
out
and
gently
pats
it
over
the
gash
in
her
forehead
she
winces
in
pain
but
doesn't
pull
away
she
looks
up
at
her
watcher
sadly
for
a
moment
then
lowers
her
eyes
giles
turns
the
nowbloody
cloth
over
and
continues
to
lightly
dab
it
on
her
wound

buffy
grabs
a
new
jar
of
peanut
butter
and
tries
to
open
it
buffy
sighs

to
him

xander

just
need
a
big
strong
man
xander
smiles
he
struggles
with
the
jar
for
a
while
then
tries
to
cover
it
with
a
laugh

hand
