throws
a
solid
right
to
his
face
followed
by
a
left
the
vampire
isn't
fazed
and
he
grabs
her
and
throws
her
onto
a
pool

he
leans
over

by
the
shoulders
and
pulls

bashes
the
vampire's
head
into
the

around
and
punches

in

gut
and
the
face
the
vampire
falls
to
the
floor
unconscious
buffy
is
impressed
and
gives
him
a
big
smile
xander
offers
her
his
hand
to
help
her
off
of
the
pool
table
you
alright
buffy
exhales
thanks
to
you
she
slides
off
of
the
table
and
notices
xander's
hand
you
hurt
your
hand
will
you
still
be
able
to
finish
my
solo
and
kiss
you
like
you've
never
been
kissed
before
he
gives
her
a
wink
and
starts
back
to
the
stage
the
vampire
gets
back
up
and
growls
at
buffy
xander
sees
him
breaks
the
leg
off
of
a
chair
that's
been
knocked
over
and
throws
the
makeshift
stake
at
the
vampire
buffy
watches
the
stake
fly
into
the
vampire's
chest
and
he
falls
dead
she
turns
her
gaze
back
on
xander
he
jumps
up
onto
stage
and
grabs
his
guitar
to
continue
his
solo
buffy
looks
up
at
him
adoringly
and
advances
to
the
stage
as
he
plays
you're
drooling
xander
gives
her
a
confused
look
cut
to
science
class
it's
dark
because
dr
gregory
is
giving
a
slide
show
xander
he
wakes
up
from
his
daydream
and
shakes
his
head
buffy
indicates
the
corner
of
her
mouth
you've
got
a
little
he
picks
up
on
her
gesture
and
quickly
wipes
the
drool
off
of
his
mouth
and
chin
their
ancestors
were
here
long
before
we
were
their
progeny
will
be
here
long
after
we
are
gone
the
simple
and
ubiquitous
ant
he
turns
off
the
projector
turns
the
lights
on
and
begins
walking
up
the
aisle
now
if
you
read
the
homework
you
should
know
the
two
ways
that
ants
communicate
he
stops
at
xander's
lab
table
and
leans
on
it
to
face
buffy
miss
summers
ways
that
ants
communicate
dr
gregory
nodding
his
head
mm
with
other
ants
from
the
homework
willow
tries
to
get
buffy's
attention
ants
are
communicating
buffy
sees
willow's
signals
um
uh
uh
willow
strokes
xander's
back
indicating
'touch'
touch
dr
gregory
nodding
mmhm
and
um
she
looks
at
willow
again
she
is
sniffing
xander
indicating
'smell'
buffy
confused
bo
several
students
laugh
willow
gives
her
a
disappointed
look
thank
god
someone
finally
found
the
courage
to
mention
that
that
would
be
touch
and
smell
miss
summers
is
there
anything
else
miss
rosenberg
would
like
to
tell
you
willow
quickly
turns
away
in
her
seat
the
bell
rings
dr
gregory
starts
to
move
back
to
the
front
of
the
class
alright
chapters
six
through
eight
by
tomorrow
people
dr
gregory
stops
and
looks
back
at
buffy
can
i
see
you
for
a
moment
buffy
nods
cut
to
after
the
other
students
have
left
the
room
buffy
leans
against
a
lab
table
dr
gregory
idly
reviews
his
slides
i
gather
you
had
a
few
problems
at
your
last
school
well
what
teenager
doesn't
cut
school
get
in
fights
burn
down
the
gymnasium
principal
flutie
showed
me
your
permanent
record
he
walks
to
the
front
of
the
class
and
buffy
follows
him
well
that
fire
i
mean
there
was
major
extenuating
circumstances
actually
it's
uh
kinda
funny
can't
wait
to
see
what
you're
gonna
do
here
he
goes
to
the
closet
gets
his
other
glasses
from
his
coat
and
cleans
them
destructo
girl
that's
me
but
i
suspect
it's
gonna
be
great
you
mean
'great'
in
a
bad
way
dr
gregory
looks
at
her
then
back
at
his
glasses
you
have
a
first
rate
mind
and
you
can
think
on
your
feet
imagine
what
you
could
accomplish
if
you
actually
did
the
the
homework
thing
the
homework
thing
i
understand
you
probably
have
a
good
excuse
for
not
doing
it
dr
gregory
closes
the
closet
and
walks
back
to
his
lab
table
amazingly
enough
i
don't
care
i
know
you
can
excel
in
this
class
and
so
i
expect
no
less
is
that
clear
yeah
sorry
don't
be
sorry
be
smart
dr
gregory
looks
at
another
slide
and
please
don't
listen
to
the
principal
or
anyone
else's
negative
opinion
about
you
let's
make
'em
eat
that
permanent
record
whadaya
say
he
looks
up
at
buffy
and
gives
her
a
little
smile
she
smiles
back
okay
thanks
he
nods
his
head
she
grabs
her
bag
chapters
six
through
eight
buffy
looks
back
at
him
with
a
smile
and
leaves
the
classroom
dr
gregory
puts
the
slide
down
goes
over
to
turn
off
the
lights
and
comes
back
to
his
slideviewing
plate
while
he
concentrates
on
the
slides
the
closet
door
opens
cut
to
a
view
of
dr
gregory
from
the
closet
the
camera
advances
on
him
cut
in
front
of
him
he's
concentrating
on
the
slides
cut
behind
him
a
large
green
mantis
claw
goes
around
his
neck
dr
gregory
looks
up
behind
him
and
screams
the
claw
drags
him
off
of
his
chair
his
glasses
hit
the
floor
and
break
and
an
instant
later
so
does
he
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

the
bronze
the
live
band
is
superfine
playing
already
met
you
xander
dances
lamely
through
the
crowd
the
first
date's
the
worst
date

hard
to
know
just
what
to
do
and
i
take
you
to
dinner
you
don't
eat
you
just
play
with
your
food
xander
is
on
the
dance
floor
and
looks
around
he
makes
his
way
to
the
stage
and
gives
the
singer
an
acknowledging
nod
and
grin
and
there's
something
familiar
the
singer
gives
him
a
'get
outta
here'
look
about
every
word
you
say
xander
is
disappointed
and
moves
away
from
the
stage
it's
hard
to
believe
it's
happened
again
i
already
met
you
and
i
already
met
you
you're
like
my
last
girlfriend
yes
and
the
girlfriend
i
had
before
her
xander
goes
over
to
the
bar
where
blayne

ooo
cheryl's
sister
the
one
in
college
blayne
nods
home
for
the
holidays
and
lookin'
for
love
she's
not
my
type
though
girls
really
gotta
have
something
to
go
with
me
xander
interrupting
something
like
a
lobotomy
the
two
boys
look
at
him
xander
how
many
times
you
score
well
uh
it's
just
a
question
are
we
talking
today
or
the
whole
week
the
two
boys
snicker
xander
spots
buffy
and
willow
coming
down
the
stairs
ooo
duty
calls
he
leaves
the
bar
and
approaches
the
girls
as
blayne
and
his
friend
watch
babes
the
girls
look
back
at
him
he
comes
up
to
them
with
his
arms
wide
open
and
grabs
them
both
around
the
shoulders
what
are
you
doing
xander
to
buffy
work
with
me
here
blayne
had
the
nerve
to
question
my
manliness
i'm
just
gonna
give
him
a
visual
willow
throws
her
arms
around
him
tightly
we'll
show
him
xander
looks
back
at
blayne
gives
him
a
thumbs
up
and
puts
his
arm
back
around
willow
the
two
boys
seem
impressed
buffy
distracted
i
don't
believe
it
i
know
and
after
all
my
conquests
buffy
sees
angel
and
goes
over
to
him
who's
that
that
must
be
angel
i
think
that
weird
guy
that
warned
her
about
all
the
vampires
that's
him
i'll
bet
you
well
he's
buff
she
never
said
anything
about
him
being
buff
you
think
he's
buff
he's
a
very
attractive
man
how
come
that
never
came
up
cut
to
angel
buffy
comes
up
to
him
well
look
who's
here
hi
i'd
say
it's
nice
to
see
you
but
then
we
both
know
that's
a
big
fib
i
won't
be
long
no
you'll
just
give
me
a
cryptic
warning
about
some
exciting
new
catastrophe
and
then
disappear
into
the
night
right
you're
cold
you
can
take
it
angel
takes
off
his
jacket
i
mean
you
look
cold
he
puts
his
jacket
around
her
shoulders
cut
to
willow
and
xander
oh

give
her
your
jacket
it's
a
balmy
night
no
one
needs
to
be
trading
clothing
out
there
cut
to
buffy
and
angel
a
little
big
on
me
buffy
notices
a
series
of
cuts
on
angel's
arm
what
happened
i
didn't
pay
attention
to
somebody
with
a
big
fork
he's
coming
the
fork
guy
don't
let
him
corner
you
don't
give
him
a
moment's
mercy
he'll
rip
your
throat
out
okay
i'll
give
you
improved
marks
for
that
one
ripping
a
throat
out
it's
a
strong
visual
it's
not
cryptic
i
have
to
go
angel
leaves
buffy
stares
after
him
sweet
dreams
to
you
too
cut

he
reaches
down

flips
willow's
book
closed
she
has
to
stop
it
from

what

is
he
sick
they
didn't
say
anything
about

they
said
missing
willow
and
buffy
exchange
a
look

is
bad
if

one
of
the
only
teachers
that
doesn't
think
buffy's
a
felon
i'm
really
sorry
i'm
sure
he'll
he
looks
up

amused
looks

trying
to
remember
the
way
he
turns
back
to
natalie
xander
smiles
i

every
day
natalie
laughs
xander
looks
to
the
girls
for

buffy
just
shrug
blayne
appears
behind
natalie
and
introduces
himself

from
the
varsity

blayne
smiles
smugly
oh
thank
you
blayne
she
and
blayne
leave
xander's
gaze
follows
them
for
a
moment
and
then
he
turns
back
to
willow
and
buffy
it's
funny
how
the
earth
never
opens
up
and
swallows
you
when
you
want
it
to
the
girls
nod
their
heads
and
give
each
other
a
smile
cut
to
science
class
natalie
is
writing
her
name
on
the
board
buffy
willow
and
xander
walk
in
buffy
spots
dr
gregory's
glasses
on
the
floor
and
picks
them
up
what's
wrong
dr
gregory
dropped
his
glasses
why
wouldn't
he
pick
them
up
she
sets
the
glasses
on
the
lab
table
and
gives
natalie
a
glance
as
she
walks
to
her
stool
natalie
faces
the
class
my
name
is
natalie
french
and
i
will
be
substituting
for
dr
gregory
do
you
know
when
he's
coming
back
no
i
don't
um
natalie
checks
her
roster
buffy
they
just
call
and
tell
me
where
they
want
me
blayne
in
a
low
voice
i'll
tell
you
where
i
want
you
excuse
me
blayne
uh
i
was
just
wondering
if
you
were
gonna
pick
up
where
dr
gregory
left
off
natalie
smiles
yes
his
notes
tell
me
you
were
right
in
the
middle
of
insect
life
she
picks
up
a
mantis
mounted
in
a
clear
plastic
box
the
praying
mantis
is
a
fascinating
creature
forced
to
live
alone
who
can
tell
me
why
buffy
she
puts
the
mantis
back
down
well
the
words
'bugugly'
kinda
spring
to
mind
there's
lots
of
muffled
laughter
there
is
nothing
ugly
about
these
unique
creatures
the
reason
they
live
alone
is
because
they're
cannibals
eww
everyone
in
class
looks
disgusted
oh
well
it's
hardly
their
fault
it's
the
way
nature
designed
them
noble
solitary
and
prolific
over
1800
species
worldwide
and
in
nearly
all
of
them
the
female
is
larger
and
more
aggressive
than
the
male
blayne
to
buffy
nothing
wrong
with
an
aggressive
female
buffy
angles
her
head
and
gives
him
a
look
natalie
picks
up
her
notebook
and
starts
to
walk
around
the
room
the
california
mantis
lays
her
eggs
and
then
finds
a
mate
she
looks
at
xander
he
stares
back
to
fertilize
them
once
he's
played
his
part
she
covers
the
eggs
in
a
protective
sack
and
attaches
it
to
a
leaf
or
twig
out
of
danger
now
if
she's
done
her
job
correctly
in
a
few
months
she'll
have
several
hundred
offspring
she
has
made
her
way
back
to
the
front
of
the
class
and
puts
down
her
notebook
you
know
we
should
make
some
model
egg
sacks
for
the
science
fair
who
would
like
to
help
me
do
that
after
school
all
the
boys
raise
their
hands
natalie
pleased
good
cut
to
the
cafeteria
buffy
willow
and
xander
are
in

hot
dog
surprise
be
still
my
heart
call
me
oldfashioned
i
don't
want
any
more
surprises
in
my
hot
dogs
i
wonder
what
she
sees
in
me
it's
probably
the
quiet
good
looks
coupled
with
a
certain
smoky
magnetism
willow
raises
her
eyebrows
at
him
she
turns
to
buffy
and
they
smile
miss
french
you
two're
probably
a
little
young
to
understand
what
an
older
woman
would
see
in
a
younger
man
oh
i
understand
good
the
younger
man
is
too
dumb
to
wonder
why
an
older
woman
can't
find
someone
her
own
age
and
too
desperate
to
care
about
the
surgical
improvements
what
surgical
improvements
well
he
is
young
and
so
terribly
innocent
hey
those
that
can
do
those
that
can't
laugh
at
those
who
can
do
blayne

willow
run
to
see
what's
wrong
cordelia
backs
away
from
the
fridge
his
head
his
head
oh
my
god
where's
his
head
buffy
and
willow
arrive
to
see
what's
inside
buffy
stares
in
disbelief
xander
is
close
behind
and
has
to
look
away
when
he
sees
willow
looks
squeamish
the
name
on
the
body's
lab
coat
is
'dr
gregory'
cut
to
the
library
giles
pours
a
glass
of
water
he
brings
it
over
to
buffy
who
is
sitting
on
the
steps
with
willow
both
girls
have
deeply
sad
looks
on
their
faces
buffy
has
been
crying
giles
hands
the
glass
to
buffy
here
drink
this
buffy
takes
the
glass
no
thank
you
buffy
takes
a
sip
xander
behind
giles
i've
never
seen
giles
looks
back
at
xander
i
mean
i've
never
seen
anything
like
that
was
new
who
would
wanna
hurt
dr
gregory
uh
he
didn't
have
any
enemies
on
the
staff
that
i'm
aware
of
he
was
a
civilized
man
i
liked
him
so
did
i
willow
looks
up
at
giles
well
we're
gonna
find
out
who
did
this
we'll
find
them
and
we'll
stop
them
count
on
it
what
do
we
know
oh
not
a
lot
um
buffy
sniffs
and
wipes
a
tear
from
her
nose
he
was
killed
here
on
campus
i'm
guessing
the
last
day
we
saw
him
how
do
you
work
that
out
he
didn't
change
his
clothing
this
is
a
question
that
no
one
particularly
wants
to
hear
but
where
did
they
put
his
head
good
point
i
didn't
wanna
hear
that
angel
buffy
gets
up
he
warned
me
that
something
was
coming
she
takes
another
sip
of
water
as
she
walks
over
to
the
table
yes
yes
he
did
didn't
he
i
wish
i
knew
what
he
meant
i've
been
trying
to
gather
more
information
about
the
master
our
uh
local
vampire
king
there
was
one
oblique
reference
to
a
a
a
vampire
who
displeased
the
master
and
cut
his
hand
off
in
penance
cut
off
his
hand
and
replaced
it
with
a
fork
i
don't
know
what
he
replaced
it
with
so
why
would
he
come
after
a
teacher
i'm
not
certain
he
did
there
was
an
incident
two
nights
ago
he
walks
over
to
the
counter
picks
up
a
newspaper
and
returns
with
it
uh
involving
a
homeless
person
in
weatherly
park
he
was
practically
shredded
but
uh
nothing
like
dr
gregory
buffy
looks
at
the
paper
fork
guy
doesn't
do
heads
not
historically
and
dr
gregory's
blood
wasn't
drained
so
there's
something
else
out
there
besides
silverwareman
oh
this
is
fun
we're
on
monster
island
we're
on
a
hellmouth
it's
a
center
of
mystical
convergence
guess
it's
the
same
thing
buffy
walks
toward
xander
well
unpleasant
things
do
gravitate
here
it's
true
but
uh
we
don't
know
there's
anything
besides
this
chap
he's
still
our
likely
suspect
where
was
that
guy
killed
weatherly
park
buffy
giles
advances
toward
her
i
know
you're
upset
but
uh
this
is
no
time
to
go
hunting
not
until
we
know
more
please
promise
me
you
won't
do
anything
rash
cross
my
heart
cut
to
the
park
at
night
buffy
climbs
the
fence
she
walks
through
the
park
carefully
looking
around
a
bum
comes
up
to
her
shouldn't
be
out
here
at
night
little
lady
dangerous
the
bum
leaves
she
notices
another
bum
on
the
ground
in
front
of
a
bench
and
she
checks
him
out
he's
okay
just
asleep
buffy
continues
stalking
dogs
bark
in
the
distance
buffy
finds
some
shrubbery
covering
a
sewer
access
hole
she
moves
it
aside
and
fork
guy
jumps
out
at
her
she
rushes
backward
he
swings
with
his
claw
but
misses
she
slams
her
straight
arm
into
his
gut
then
again
into
his
back
he
swings
again
but
buffy
dodges
him
she
backhand
punches
him
in
the
face
does
a
roundhouse
kick
to
his
jaw
and
backhand
punches
his
face
again
he
takes
another
swing
at
buffy
but
she
evades
it
she
front
kicks
him
he
lunges
at
her
and
she
grabs
his
arm
and
flips
him
over
onto
his
back
buffy
tries
to
stake
him
but
he
rolls
away
and
back
onto
his
feet
she
kicks
him
again
and
he
staggers
backward
and
falls
buffy
hears
voices
and
turns
to
see
people
with
flashlights
coming
over
the
hill
hold
it
police
did
you
see
that
i
got
nothing
here
buffy
looks
back
and
forth
between
fork
guy
and
the
posse
the
vampire
runs
off
i
heard
it
spread
out
let's
go
over
here
this
way
this
way
alright
buffy
makes
tracks
after
the
vampire
cut
to
the
fence
at
the
edge
of
the
park
natalie
is
walking
home
on
the
other
side
with
grocery
bags
in
her
arms
the
vampire
stalks
her
and
climbs
over
the
fence
buffy
comes
running
up
the
vampire
lands
behind
natalie
buffy
reaches
the
fence
and
watches
natalie
senses
the
vampire
stops
and
turns
to
face
him
the
vampire
hisses
and
runs
away
in
fear
natalie
watches
him
go
buffy
can't
believe
what
she's
seeing
the
vampire
crosses
the
street
lifts
a
manhole
cover
and
climbs
down
natalie
continues
her
walk
home
the
vampire
pulls
the
manhole
cover
back
into
place
buffy
just
stares
after
natalie
part

sunnydale
high
the
next
morning
cut
to
the
library
you
went
hunting
last
night
yes
he
walks
into
his
office
she
follows
behind
him
when
you
assured
me
you
wouldn't
giles
takes
a
sip
from
his
mug
yes
i
lied
i'm
a
bad
person
let's
move
on
giles
opens
his
file
cabinet
did
you
see
someone
with
a
fork
more
like
a
jumbo
claw
giles
turns
to
face
her
oh
well
uh
at
least
you're
not
hurt
and
i
saw
something
else
something
much
more
interesting
than
your
average
runofthemill
killer
vampire
oh
do
you
know
miss
french
the
teacher
that's
subbing
for
dr
gregory
giles
smiles
yes
yes
she's
lovely
in
a
a
common
extremely
well
proportioned
way
giles
puts
some
files
away
well
i'm
chasing
claw
guy
last
night
and
miss
well
proportioned
is
heading
home
the
claw
guy
takes
one
look
at
her
and
runs
screaming
for
cover
giles
confused
he
what
ran
away
he
was
petrified
of
miss
french
uh
huh
so
i'm
an
undead
monster
that
can
shave
with
my
hand
how
many
things
am
i
afraid
of
not
many
and
not
substitute
teachers
as
a
rule
so
what's
her
deal
i
think
perhaps
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
we
kept
an
eye
on
her
then
i
better
get
to
class
she
leaves
the
office
cut
to
buffy
rushing
down
the
stairs
in
the
halls
she
is
stopped
by
principal
flutie
you
were
there
you
saw
dr
gregory
didn't
you
um
you
mean
yesterday
in
the
cafeteria
when
we
found
him
don't
say
dead
or
decapitated
or
decomposing
i'd
stay
away
from
dwords
altogether
but
you
witnessed
the
event
so
this
way
please
mr
flutie
starts
down
the
hall
buffy
stops
him
short
well
no
i'm
gonna
be
late
for
biology
extremely
late
mr
flutie
starts
down
the
hall
again
you
have
to
see
a
counselor
everyone
who
saw
the
body
has
to
see
a
crisis
counselor
but
i
really
don't
need
we
all
need
help
with
our
feelings
otherwise
we
bottle
them
up
and
before
you
know
it
powerful
laxatives
are
involved
i
really
believe
if
we
all
reach
out
to
one
another
we
can
beat
this
thing
i'm
always
here
if
you
need
a
hug
mr
flutie
jumps
back
but
not
a
real
hug
because
there's
no
touching
this
school
is
sensitive
to
wrong
touching
but
i
really
really
don't
no
you
have
to
talk
to
a
counselor
and
start
the
healing
you
have
to
heal
but
mr
flutie
i
heal
he
sits
her
down
in
a
chair
outside
of
the
counselor's
office
and
paces
off
buffy
leans
back
in
the
chair
and
looks
bummed
then
she
hears
cordelia
inside
the
office
i
don't
know
what
to
say
it
was
really
i
mean
one
minute
you're
in
your
normal
life
and
then
who's
in
the
fridge
cordelia
the
camera
pans
over
to
show
her
inside
it
really
gets
to
you
a
thing
like
that
cordelia
cut
inside
it
was
let's
just
say
i
haven't
been
able
to
eat
a
thing
since
yesterday
i
think
i
lost
like
seven
and
a
half
ounces
way
swifter
than
that
socalled
diet
that
quack
put
me
on
oh
i'm
not
saying
that
we
should
kill
a
teacher
every
day
just
so
i
can
lose
weight
i'm
just
saying
when
tragedy
strikes
we
have
to
look
on
the
bright
side
you
know
cut
to
buffy
what
she's
hearing
is
just
too
weird
like
how

of
her
factoid
3
her
fashion
sense
screams
predator
it's
the

have
to
be
a
shapeshifter
or
a
perception
distorter
on
a
helpful
note
i
had
a
chum
at
oxford
carlyle
advanced
degrees

entomawho
bugs
and
fairy
tales
i
knew
that
if
i

carlyle
just

was
some
beast

the
pc
beeps
buffy
911
blayne's
mom
called
the
school
he
never
came

the
boy
who
worked
with
miss
french
yesterday
yeah
if
miss
french
is
responsible
for
xander's
supposed
to
be
helping
her
right
now
he's
got
a
crush
on
a
giant
insect
okay
don't
panic
i'll
warn
him
but
i
need
you
to
hack
onto
the
coroner's
office
for
me
well
what
are
we
looking
for
autopsy
on
dr
gregory
i've
been
trying
to
figures
out
these
marks
that
i
saw
on
his
corpse
i'm
thinking
they
were
teeth
and
uh
these
cuddlies
buffy
points
to
a
picture
of
a
mantis
should
definitely
be
brushing
after
every
meal
buffy
willow
types
buffy
to
giles
and
you
were
saying
something
about
a
beast
giles
gets
up
to
go
to
his
office
oh
uh
yeah
i
just
need
to
make
one
transatlantic
telephone
call
giles
stops
and
turns
back
um
this
computer
invasion
that
willow's
performing
on
the
coroner's
office
one
one
assumes
it
is
entirely
legal
willow
and
buffy
answer
simultaneously
entirely
of
course
right
wasn't
here
didn't
see
it
couldn't
have
stopped
you
good
idea
cut
outside
buffy
catches
up
with
xander
hey
hey
so
how'd
it
go
with
miss
french
well
it's
a
bit
demanding
being
her
absolute
favorite
guy
in
the
universe
but
i'll
muddle
through
xander
she's
not
what
she
seems
i
know
she's
so
much
more
okay
um
i'm
gonna
have
to
tell
you
something
about
her
and
i'm
gonna
need
you
to
really
listen
okay
okay
i
don't
think
she's
human
i
see
so
if
she's
not
human
she's
technically
a
big
bug
xander
laughs
this
sounds
really
weird
i'm
aware
of
that
it
doesn't
sound
weird
at
all
i
completely
understand
i've
met
someone
and
you're
jealous
what
look
there's
nothing
i
can
do
about
it
uh
there's
just
this
certain
chemical
thing
between
miss
french
and
me
i
know
i
read
all
about
it
it's
call
um
a
pheromone
it's
a
chemical
attractant
that
insects
give
off
she's
not
an
insect
she's
a
woman
okay
and
hard
as
that
may
be
for
you
to
conceive
an
actual
woman
finds
me
attractive
i
realize
it's
no
mystery
guy
handing
out
leather
jackets
and
while
we're
on
the
subject
what
kind
of
a
girlie
name
is
'angel'
anyway
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
nothing

just
kinda
