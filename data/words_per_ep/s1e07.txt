entire
gallon
of
gatorade
without
taking
a
breath
xander
smiles
it
was
pretty
impressive
although
later
there
was
an
ick
factor
giles
coming
to
the
table
can
we
steer
this
riveting
conversation
back
to
the
events
that
happened
earlier
in
the
evening
giles
buffy
sits
down
you
left
the
bronze
and
were
set
upon
by
three
unusually
virile
vampires
giles
puts
a
book
in
front
of
her
did
they
look
like
this
yeah
what's
with
the
uniforms
it
seems
you
encountered
the
three
warrior
vampires
very
proud
and
very
strong
willow
to
giles
how
is
it
you
always
know
this
stuff
you
always
know
what's
going
on
i
never
know
what's
going
on
well
you
weren't
here
from
midnight
until
six
researching
it
no
i
was
sleeping
uh
oobviously
you're
hurting
the
master
very
much
he
he
wouldn't
send
the
the
three
for
just
anyone
we
must
step
up
our
training
with
weapons
buffy
you
should
stay
at
my
house
until
these
samurai
guys
are
history
buffy
turns
to
him
what
ahahah
don't
worry
about
angel
willow
can
run
to
your
house
and
tell
him
to
get
out
of
town
fast
angel
and
buffy
are
are
not
in
any
immediate
jeopardy
eventually
the
master
will
send
someone
else
but
in
the
meantime
the
three
having
failed
will
offer
their
own
lives
in
penance
cut
to
the
master's
lair
we
failed
in
our
duty
and
now
our
lives
belong
to
you
he
hands
the
master
a
spear
the
master
passes
it
to
darla
she
starts
to
walk
around
behind
the
three
as
the
master
goes
over
to
collin
pay
attention
child
you
are
the
anointed
and
there
is
much
you
must
learn
master
crouches
beside
him
with
power
comes
responsibility
true
they
did
fail
but
also
true
we
who
walk
at
night
share
a
common
bond
the
taking
of
a
life
i'm
not
talking
about
humans
of
course
is
a
serious
matter
one
of
the
three
raises
his
head
in
hope
so
you
would
spare
them
hmm
master
gets
up
i
am
weary
and
their
deaths
will
bring
me
little
joy
the
master
begins
to
walk
away
and
collin
follows
darla
watches
them
go
and
smiles
she
lifts
the
spear
and
dispatches
the
first
of
the
three
the
master
stops
and
turns
to
collin
of
course
sometimes
a
little
is
enough
he
looks
over
at
darla
as
she
kills
the
next
one
and
continues
away
cut
to
the
school
cut
to
the
library
door
giles
sets
out
a
sign
that
reads
'library

the
crossbow
comes
later
he
takes
the
crossbow
from
her
and
goes
to
put
it
back
buffy
is
disappointed
you
must
first
become
proficient
with
the
basic
tools
of
combat
giles
buffy
looks
bored
and
let's
begin
giles
comes
back
with
two
poles

the
quarterstaff
which
incidentally
will
uh
require
countless
hours
of
vigorous
training

through
the
ages
giles
grabs
his
staff
now

me
good
steady
progress
with
the
quarterstaff
and
in
due
course
we'll

your
pads
buffy
laughs
i'm
not
gonna
need
pads
to
fight
you
well
we'll
see
about
that
en
garde
he
makes
several
thrusts
and
she
parries
them
all
she
takes
the
offensive
pushes
his
staff
to
the
floor
and
punches
him
in
the
face
she
comes
around
with
the
staff
into
his
back
and
again
to
knock
his
legs
out
from
under
him
he
falls
onto
his
back
she
stands
over
him

the
summers
house
at
night
cut
to
buffy
coming
into
her
room
she
closes
the
door
and
looks
around
angel
hey
she
turns
on
her
desk
lamp
brought
you
some
dinner
it's
a
little
plateless
sorry
she
hands
him
a
plastic
bag
full
of
food
that
she
pilfered
from
dinner
he
accepts
it
and
looks
at
it
so
what'd
you
do
all
day
uh
i
read
a
little
buffy
looks
over
to
her
diary
it's
out
of
place
and
just
thought
about
a
lot
of
things
buffy
i
my
diary
you
read
my
diary
buffy
goes
to
put
it
in
a
drawer
that
is
not
okay
a
diary
is
like
a
person's
most
private
place
buffy
comes
back
to
him
i
you
don't
even
know
what
i
was
writing
about
'hunk'
can
mean
a
lot
of
things
bad
things
and
and
when
it
says
that
your
eyes
are
'penetrating'
i
meant
to
write
'bulging'
buffy
and
'a'
doesn't
even
stand
for
'angel'
for
that
matter
it
stands
for
'achmed'
a
charming
foreign
exchange
student
so
that
whole
fantasy
part
has
nothing
to
even
do
with
you
at
all
your
mother
moved
your
diary
when
she
came
in
to
straighten
up
i
watched
from
the
closet
i
didn't
read
it
i
swear
she
just
looks
at
him
oh
buffy
looks
down
realizing
what
she
just
said
oh
i
did
a
lot
of
thinking
today
i
really
can't
be
around
you
angel
buffy
looks
up
because
when
i
am
buffy
looks
down
hey
no
big
water
over
the
bridge
under
the
bridge
when
i
am
all
i
can
ever
think
about
is
how
badly
i
want
to
kiss
you
over
the
dam
buffy
looks
up
at
him
kiss
me
i'm
older
than
you
and
this
can't
ever
i
better
go
hhow
much
older
i
should
buffy
approaches
him
go
you
said
they
kiss
they
kiss
again
they
kiss
passionately
she
puts
her
arm
around
him
the
kiss
goes
on
for
several
moments
angel
suddenly
pulls
back
and
looks
away
what
what
is
it
what's
wrong
he
turns
to
face
her
and
growls
she
sees
he
has
his
game
face
on
and
screams
he
takes
a
last
look
at
her
and
jumps
out
of
the
window
he
slides
down
the
roof
and
off
onto
the
ground
buffy
goes
to
the
window
and
watches
him
run
away
her
mother
comes
running
into
the
room
buffy
what
happened
she
backs
away
from
the
window
her
mom
takes
her
by
the
shoulders
she
looks
at
her
mom
and
shakes
her
head
uh
nothing
i
saw
a
shadow
they
both
look
out
the
window
part
2

the
next
morning
at
sunnydale
high
the
team
is
walking
up
the
steps
from
the
street
toward
the
building
angel's
a
vampire
i
can't
believe
this
is
happening
one
minute
we
were
kissing
and
the
next
minute
buffy
to
giles
can
a
vampire
ever
be
a
good
person
couldn't
it
happen
a
vampire
isn't
a
person
at
all
giles
clears
his
throat
it
may
have
the
movements
the
the
memories
even
the
personality
of
the
person
that
it
took
over
but
iit's
still
a
demon
at
the
core
there
is
no
halfway
so
that'd
be
a
no
huh
well
then
what
was
he
doing
why
was
he
good
to
me
was
it
all
some
part
of
the
master's
plan
it
doesn't
make
sense
they've
reached
a
bench
where
willow
and
buffy
sit
alright
uh
xander
sits
also
you
have
a
problem
and
it's
not
a
small
one
let's
take
a
breath
and
look
at
this
calmly
and
objectively
angel's
a
vampire
you're
a
slayer
i
think
it's
obvious
what
you
have
to
do
xander
smiles
buffy
doesn't
react
so
xander
looks
up
at
giles
giles
crouches
down
uh
it
is
a
slayer's
duty
ii
know
you
have
feelings
for
this
guy
but
it's
not
like
you're
in
love
with
him
right
buffy
looks
away
you're
in
love
with
a
vampire
what
are
you
outta
your
mind
what
he
looks
at
cordelia
she's
looking
somewhere
else
but
turns
to
him
xander
to
cordelia
not
vampire
xander
to
buffy
how
could
you
love
an
umpire
everyone
hates
'em
cordelia
looks
back
at
another
girl
wearing
the
same
dress
she
is
where
did
you
get
that
dress
cordelia
pursues
her
this
is
a
oneof
akind
todd
oldham
do
you
know
how
much
this
dress
cost
is
this
a
knockoff
cordelia
checks
the
label
this
is
a
knockoff
isn't
it
some
cheesy
knockoff
this
is
exactly
what
happens
when
you
sign
these
free
trade
agreements
the
two
girls
disappear
into
the
building
you
think
we
have
problems
cut
to
the
hall
outside
angel's
apartment
he
comes
through
the
door
and
goes
to
his
apartment
door
he
unlocks
it
and
goes
in
cut
inside
there
are
a
bunch
of
old
books
stacked
along
the
wall
he
closes
the
door
and
goes
over
to
turn
on
a
lamp
when
he
straightens
back
up
he
senses
a
presence
who's
here
a
friend
he
quickly
faces
the
voice
darla
comes
out
of
the
shadows
wearing
a
catholic
schoolgirl
uniform
hi
it's
been
a
while
a
lifetime
or
two
but
who's
counting
what's
with
the
catholic
schoolgirl
look
last
time
i
saw
you
it
was
kimonos
and
last
time
i
saw
you
it
wasn't
high
school
girls
darla
flares
the
skirt
don't
cha
like
darla
approaches
angel
remember
budapest
turn
of
the
century
you
were
such
a
bad
boy
during
that
earthquake
you
did
some
damage
yourself
is
there
anything
better
than
a
natural
disaster
darla
walks
away
the
panic
the
people
lost
in
the
streets
it's
like
picking
fruit
off
the
vine
darla
reaches
the
bed
nice
you're
living
above
ground
like
one
of
them
you
and
your
new
friend
are
attacking
us
like
one
of
them
darla
walks
to
the
window
but
guess
what
precious
you're
not
one
of
them
she
draws
the
window
blinds
open
letting
in
a
stream
of
sunlight
angel
is
blinded
and
he
stumbles
backward
to
get
out
of
the
light
are
you
no
but
i'm
not
exactly
one
of
you
either
darla
walks
to
the
fridge
is
that
what
you
tell
yourself
these
days
she
opens
the
refrigerator
and
sees
the
bags
and
bottles
of
human
blood
you're
not
exactly
living
off
quiche
darla
closes
the
fridge
you
and
i
both
know
what
you
hunger
for
darla
goes
over
to
him
what
you
need
hey
it's
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
it's
who
we
are
it's
what
makes
eternal
life
worth
living
darla
smiles
and
touches
him
mm
you
can
only
suppress
your
real
nature
for
so
long
you
can
feel
it
brewing
inside
of
you
i
hope
i'm
around
when
it
explodes
maybe
you
don't
wanna
be
i'm
not
afraid
of
you
i
bet
she
is
though
darla
starts
to
leave
or
maybe
i'm
underestimating
her
talk
to
her
tell
her
about
the
curse
maybe
she'll
come
around
and
if
she
still
doesn't
trust
you
you
know
where
i'll
be
she
exits
the
apartment
leaving
an
angry
angel
behind
cut
to
the
library
buffy
is
looking
through
a
book
so
are
willow
and
xander
giles
comes
up
behind
xander
and
startles
him
here's
something
at
last
can
you
please
warn
us
before
you
do
that
there's
nothing
about
angel
in
the
texts
but
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
it's
been
ages
since
i've
read
the
diaries
of
any
of
the
watchers
before
me
willow
to
buffy
that
musta
been
so
embarrassing
when
you
thought
he
had
read
your
diary
but
then
it
turned
out
he
hadn't
but
then
he
felt
the
same
way
willow
xander
gives
her
a
look
i'm
listening
there's
mention
some
two
hundred
years
ago
in
ireland
of
of
angelus
the
one
with
the
angelic
face
they
got
that
right
xander
clears
his
throat
i'm
not
saying
anything
i
have
nothing
to
say
does
this
uh
angel
have
um
a
tattoo
behind
his
right
shoulder
yeah
it's
a
it's
a
bird
or
something
now
i'm
sayin'
something
you
saw
him
naked
so
angel's
been
around
for
a
while
not
long
for
a
vampire
uh
two
hundred
and
forty
years
or
so
huh
two
hundred
and
forty
well
he
said
he
was
older
giles
sits
angelus
leaves
ireland
uh
wreaks
havoc
in
in
europe
for
uh
several
decades
and
then
um
about
eighty
years
ago
the
most
curious
thing
happens
he
he
comes
to
uh
to
america
um
shuns
other
vampires
and
and
lives
alone
there's
there's
no
no
record
of
him
hunting
here
so
he
is
a
good
vampire
i
mean
on
a
scale
of
one
to
ten
ten
being
someone
who's
killing
and
maiming
every
night
and
one
being
someone
who's
not
i
say
that
there's
no
record
but
uh
vampires
hunt
and
kill
it's
it's
what
they
do
fish
gotta
swim
birds
gotta
fly
he
could've
fed
on
me
he
didn't
question
a
hundred
years
or
so
before
he
came
to
our
shores
what
was
he
like
then
uh
like
all
of
them
uh
a
vicious
violent
animal
cut
to
the
master's
lair
don't
think
i'm
not
grateful
you
letting
me
kill
the
three
how
can
my
children
learn
if
i
do
everything
for
them
but
you've
gotta
let
me
take
care
of
the
slayer
oh
you're
giving
me
orders
now
darla
walks
away
okay
then
we'll
just
do
nothing
while
she
takes
us
out
one
by
one
do
i
sense
a
plan
darla
master
she
turns
around
share
darla
walks
back
angel
kills
her
and
comes
back
to
the
fold
angel
he
was
the
most
vicious
creature
i
ever
met
i
miss
him
so
do
i
master
considers
why
would
he
kill
her
if
he
feels
for
her
to
keep
her
from
killing
him
hmm
master
to
collin
you
see
how
we
all
work
together
for
the
common
good
that's
how
a
family
is
supposed
to
function
cut
to
the
school
at
night
okay
so
let's
review
cut
to
the
library
buffy
and
willow
are
studying
reconstruction
began
when
willow
looks
up
buffy
huh
buffy
comes
back
to
earth
oh
um
reconstruction
uh
reconstruction
began
after
the
construction
which
was
shoddy
so
they
had
to
reconstruct
after
the
destruction
of
the
civil
war
right
civil
war
during
which
angel
was
already
like
a
hundred
and
change
are
we
gonna
talk
about
boys
or
are
we
gonna
help
you
pass
history
buffy
looks
up
at
willow
she
closes
the
book
sometimes
i
have
this
fantasy
that
xander's
just
gonna
grab
me
and
kiss
me
right
on
the
lips
willow
huge
smile
you
want
xander
you've
gotta
speak
up
girl
no
no
no
no
no
speaking
up
that
way
leads
to
madness
and
sweaty
palms
darla
peeks
out
from
behind
the
stacks
okay
so
here's
something
i
gotta
know
when
angel
kissed
you
i
mean
before
he
turned
into
how
was
it
buffy
smiles
unbelievable
darla
continues
to
watch
and
listen
wow
and
it
is
kinda
novel
how
he'll
stay
young
and
handsome
forever
although
you'll
still
get
wrinkly
and
die
and
oh
and
what
about
the
children
willow
buffy
looks
at
her
i'll
be
quiet
now
no
it's
okay
i
need
to
hear
this
i
need
to
get
over
him
so
i
can
so
that
you
can
willow
makes
a
stabbing
gesture
like
xander
said
i'm
the
slayer
and
he's
a
vampire
god
i
can't
he's
never
done
anything
to
hurt
me
okay
no
i
need
to
stop
thinking
about
this
okay
let's
give
another
half
an
hour
and
maybe
something
will
sink
in
and
then
i'm
going
home
for
some
major
moping
darla

and
backs
away

iron
her
uh
blood

a
little
a
little
low

itself
like
mild
anemia
uh
you
you
were
uh
lucky
you

to
her
as
soon
as
you

lucky
stupid
buff

not
your
fault
no
i
invited
him
into
my
home
even
after
i
knew
who
he
was
what
he
was
and
i
didn't
do
anything
about
it
'cause
i
had
feelings
for
him
because
i
cared
about
him
if
you
care
about
somebody
you
care
about
them
you
can't
change
that
by
killing
them
maybe
not
but
i
think
it's
a
start

eye

ordinary
vampire
giles
whispers
if
there
is

a
thing

true
face

give
you
a
kiss
cut
to
buffy
in
the

with
her
aim
and
shoots
but

angel

up
onto
the
catwalk
above
buffy
can't

him
in

shadows
he
swings
down
and
kicks

in
the
back
knocking
her
onto
a
pool
table
she
does
a
standing
back
kick
at
him
behind
her
and
sends
him
into
the
wall
she
runs
around
the
table
and
dives
for
the
crossbow
she
rolls
onto
her
back
and
takes
aim
at
him
he
slowly
gets
up
and
growls
part

the
bronze
angel
is
in
his
game
face
and
buffy
has
her
crossbow
trained
on
him
angel
morphs
back
into
his
human
form
c'mon
don't
go
soft
on
me
now
buffy
launches
the
bolt
it
hits
the
wall
next
to
him
little
wide
why
buffy
gets
up
why
didn't
you
just
attack
me
when
you
had
the
chance
was
it
a
joke
to
make
me
feel
for
you
and
then
i've
killed
a
lot
of
vampires
i've
never
hated
one
before
feels
good
doesn't
it
feels
simple
i
invited
you
into
my
home
and
then
you
attacked
my
family
why
not
i
killed
mine
i
killed
their
friends
and
their
friend's
children
for
a
hundred
years
i
offered
ugly
death
to
everyone
i
met
and
i
did
it
with
a
song
in
my
heart
what
changed
fed
on
a
girl
about
your
age
beautiful
dumb
as
a
post
but
a
favorite
among
her
clan
her
clan
romany
gypsies
the
elders
conjured
the
perfect
punishment
for
me
they
restored
my
soul
what
they
were
all
out
of
boils
and
blinding
torment
when
you
become
a
vampire
the
demon
takes
your
body
but
it
doesn't
get
your
soul
that's
gone
no
conscience
no
remorse
it's
an
easy
way
to
live
you
have
no
idea
what
it's
like
to
have
done
the
things
i've
done
and
to
care
i
haven't
fed
on
a
living
human
being
since
that
day
so
you
started
with
my
mom
i
didn't
bite
her
then
why
didn't
you
say
something
but
i
wanted
to
i
can
walk
like
a
man
but
i'm
not
one
i
wanted
to
kill
you
tonight
buffy
looks
at
her
bow
and
back
at
angel
she
puts
the
bow
down
on
the
floor
and
approaches
him
she
offers
her
neck
go
ahead
he
just
looks
at
her
in
silence
not
as
easy
as
it
looks
sure
it
is
they
turn
toward
the
voice
and
see
darla
coming
out
of
the
shadows
cut
outside
giles
willow
and
xander
are
walking
down
a
street
we're
near
the
bronze
what
now
keep
looking
for
her
i
have
a
question
what
if
we
find
her
and
she's
fighting
angel
and
some
of
his
friends
what
the
heck
are
we
gonna
do
about
it
cut
to
the
bronze
do
you
know
what
the
saddest
thing
in
the
world
is
bad
hair
on
top
of
that
outfit
to
love
someone
who
used
to
love
you
buffy
looks
at
angel
you
guys
were
involved
for
several
generations
well

around
since
columbus

are
bound
to
pile
up
a
few
ex's
you're
older
than
him
right
just
between
us
girls
you
are
looking
a
little
worn
around
the
eyes
darla
smiles
i
made
him
there
was
a
time
when
we
shared
everything
wasn't
there
angelus
you
had
a
chance
to
come
home
to
rule
with
me
in
the
master's
court
for
a
thousand
years
but
you
threw
that
away
because
of
her
you
love
someone
who
hates
us
you're
sick
and
you'll
always
be
sick
and
you'll
always
remember
what
it
was
like
to
watch
her
die
darla
smiles
you
don't
think
i
came
alone
do
you
i
know
i
didn't
she
kicks
the
bow
up
into
her
hands
and
aims
it
at
darla
hmm
scary
she
produces
two
pistols
from
behind
her
back
one
in
each
hand
scarier
she
shoots
angel
he
staggers
back
onto
a
post
oh
don't
worry
bullets
can't
kill
vampires
can
hurt
them
like
hell
but
darla
giggles
buffy
retreats
darla
starts
shooting
at
her
she
does
a
diving
shoulder
roll
over
a
pool
table
and
takes
cover
behind
it
cut
outside
giles
willow
and
xander
hear
the
shots
from
inside
the
bronze
did
you
just
hear
they
run
to
find
a
way
in
cut
inside
buffy
reloads
the
crossbow
so
many
body
parts
so
few
bullets
let's
begin
with
the
kneecaps
no
fun
dancing
without
them
she
caps
off
a
few
more
rounds
and
the
pool
table
takes
a
few
hits
buffy
pops
up
with
the
crossbow
and
takes
a
shot
at
darla
she
doubles
over
when
it
hits
her
in
the
abdomen
buffy
watches
as
she
straightens
back
up
again
close
but
no
heart
she
grabs
the
bolt
pulls
it
out
and
tosses
it
aside
cut
to
giles
willow
and
xander
crawling
along
the
floor
we
need
to
distract
her
fast
willow
calls
out
buffy
it
wasn't
angel
who
attacked
your
mom
it
was
darla
darla
turns
toward
the
voice
and
lets
loose
a
hail
of
bullets
as
they
hug
the
floor
for
cover
angel
pulls
the
bolt
from
the
wall
darla
turns
her
attention
back
on
buffy
and
hops
up
onto
the
pool
table
buffy
jumps
up
grabs
the
edge
of
the
table
and
pulls
knocking
darla
onto
her
back
she
pushes
the
table
away
and
starts
to
run
for
cover
darla
fires
off
a
few
rounds
as
she
rides
the
table
across
the
floor
buffy
leaps
for
cover
over
a
glass
case
in
a
dive
roll
as
bullets
break
it
all
around
her
the
pool
table
has
stopped
sliding
and
darla
gets
up
to
look
for
buffy
she
hops
off
of
it
and
advances
on
the
counter
while
shooting
giles
gets
up
and
messes
with
the
lighting
system
controls
the
strobes
come
on
darla
looks
up
at
him
and
stops
shooting
buffy
takes
the
opportunity
to
change
position
darla
sees
her
move
and
lets
loose
another
volley
c'mon
buffy
take
it
like
a
man
angel
comes
up
behind
her
roars
and
plunges
the
bolt
into
her
back
she
is
surprised
and
cries
out
in
pain
she
turns
to
look
at
her
attacker
angel
she
falls
to
the
floor
and
bursts
into
ashes
buffy
rises
up
to
see
angel
looks
up
from
darla's
ashes
at
buffy
she
comes
out
from
behind
the
counter
he
looks
at
her
a
moment
longer
and
then
turns
and
leaves
buffy
is
speechless
and
just
watches
him
go
cut
to
the
master's
lair
he
screams
as
he
wields
a
tall
candleholder
and
smashes
it
in
anger
he
flails
out
with
his
arms
and
knocks
other
things
over
finally
he
sinks
to
the
ground
in
grief
collin
comes
over
to
him
forget
her
master
looks
up
how
dare
you
she
was
my
favorite
for
four
hundred
years
she
was
weak
you
don't
need
her
i'll
bring
you
the
slayer
but
to
lose
her
to
angel
he
was
to
have
sat
at
my
right
hand
come
the
day
and
now
they're
all
against
you
but
soon
you
shall
rise
and
when
you
do
collin
puts
a
hand
on
the
master's
shoulder
we
kill
them
all
the
master
smiles
at
him
and
gets
up
collin
takes
his
hand
and
leads
him
away
cut
to
later
at
the
bronze
ah
the
postfumigation
party
okay
so
what's
the
difference
between
this
and
the
pre
fumigation
party
much
hardier
cockroaches
so
no
word
from
angel
nah
it's
weird
though
in
his
way
i
feel
like
he's
still
watching
me
well
in
a
way
he
sort
of
is
in
the
way
of
that
he's
right
over
there
buffy
looks
over
where
willow
is
looking
and
sees
angel
she
briefly
looks
back
at
willow
and
then
heads
over
to
him
i
don't
need
to
watch
because
i'm
not
threatened
just
gonna
look
this
way
he
and
willow
sit
at
a
table
with
him
facing
away
from
buffy
and
angel
willow
watches
as
buffy
makes
her
way
over
to
angel
the
crowd
is
slow
dancing
to
i'll
remember
you
by
sophie
zelmani
did
they
know
what
they
wanted
the
times
they
kissed
me
and
your
hands
i
held
in
mine
buffy
and
angel
reach
each
other
i
just
wanted
to
see
if
you
were
okay
and
your
mother
we're
both
good
you
if
i
can
go
a
little
while
without
getting
shot
or
stabbed
i'll
be
alright
look
this
can't
ever
be
anything
i
know
for
one
thing
you're
like
two
hundred
and
twentyfour
years
older
than
i
am
i
just
gotta
i
gotta
walk
away
from
this
buffy
nods
i
know
me
too
buffy
whispers
one
of
us
has
to
go
here
angel
whispers
i
know
they
look
at
each
other
a
moment
longer
and
then
close
in
to
kiss
their
kiss
becomes
passionate
buffy
reaches
her
hands
up
to
angel's
neck
your
eyes
that
always
make
me
shiver
now
they
are
closed
they
just
sometimes
twitch
a
little
cut
to
willow
and
xander
what's
going
on
nothin'
well
as
long
as
they're
not
kissing
willow
just
watches
and
says
nothing
cut
to
angel
and
buffy
and
your
body
i
could
hold
for
an
hour
it
sent
me
to
heaven
with
its
heat
and
power
they
separate
you
okay
it's
just
painful
i
know
see
you
around
i'll
remember
you
you
will
be
there
in
my
heart
i'll
remember
you
and
that
is
all
that
i
can
do
but
i'll
remember
buffy
walks
away
angel
watches
her
go
the
camera
pans
down
to
his
chest
where
her
cross
has
left
a
deep
burn
the
end
