makes
an
ew
face
they
pass
the
bucket
of
chicken
around

dawn
awkwardly
so
what

so
how
was
it
dawn
nervous
seeing
angel
him
seeing
you
dawn
giles
stands
up
was
it
weird
buffy
looks
uncomfortable
dawn
tara
and
willow
look
expectantly
at
her
um
it
was
intense
giles
goes
to
the
back
of
the
room
to
do
something
at
a
side
table
well
iif
you
wanna
talk
about
it
i
don't
iit's
not
important
past
i'd
just
rather
keep
this
one
to
myself
if
that's
okay
sure
whatever
buffy
um
there
was
giles
sits
back
down
some
discussion
in
uh
your
absence
aabout
um
wwhat
you're
gonna
do
now
giles
has
a
pile
of
paper
napkins
gives
one
to
dawn
you
know
um
your
plans
oh
um
i've
been
giving
that
a
lot
of
thought
actually
i
think
i've
figured
it
out
what
i
should
do
willow
smiling
that's
good
that's
good
yeah
i
figure
if
i
hold
off
paying
the
plumber
i
can
pay
the
utility
bill
buffy
willow
and
tara
stop
smiling
and
then
i
can
wait
to
reshingle
the
roof
until
we
get
the
refund
back
um
i
meant
giles
buffy
stops
with
your
life
oh
life
plans
um
well
the
others
continue
to
watch
her
i
have
no
idea
dawn
looks
surprised
i
guess
um
well
i
i
left
school
you
know
when
mom
got
sick
but
i
always
figured
i'd
go
back
and
then
she
buffy
trails
off
willow
and
giles
look
sympathetic
um
so
ii
was
thinking
about
reenrolling
but
i
missed
the
registration
cutoff
busy
being
dead
and
all
giles
winces
well
if
it's
too
late
for
late
registration
and
too
early
for
early
you
can
always
come
to
classes
with
tara
and
me
right
yyou
can
audit
for
the
rest
of
the
semester
until
registration
buffy
uncertainly
audit
ii
guess
i
could
do
that
willow
and
tara
smile
tentatively
yeah
that
sounds
like
a
good
plan
buffy
looks
across
the
table
what
do
you
think
giles
giles
nods
and
looks
as
if
he's
searching
for
words
the
slayer
always
knows
what
she's
doing
cut
to
exterior
driveway
day
jonathan
paces
around
in
front
of
a
onecar
garage
the
area
is
fenced
in
with
a
garbage
cans
and
other
various
backyard
paraphernalia
jonathan
frowns
sternly
as
he
walks
and
talks
sharp
decisive
always
with
a
plan
jonathan
louder
we're
never
gonna
become
the
crime
lords
of
sunnydale
with
her
always
one
step
ahead
of
us
warren
os
well
that's
why
we're
throwing
these
tests
at
her
seeing
which
one
of
us
can
shake
her
up
the
most
maybe
find
a
weakness
or
two
jonathan
walks
forward
warren
is
on
the
ground
lying
on
his
back
on
a
rolling
platform
such
as
mechanics
use
when
working
underneath
a
car
he
rolls
out
backwards
and
looks
up
at
jonathan
she's
ready
we
see
that
he's
just
emerged
from
underneath
a
large
black
van
sweet
run
me
through
it
ah
warren
gets
up
opens
the
van's
side
door
we
got
nine
highresolution
surveillance
cameras
hooked
in
warren
points
superwide
angle
infrared
autoiris
plus
six
types
of
audio
matrix
monitoring
pan
across
the
interior
of
the
van
it's
completely
filled
with
electronics
equipment
on
both
sides
also
a
beanbag
chair
or
two
and
a
couple
of
wheeled
computer
chairs
that's
filtered
through
a
dual
quad
dvs
system
and
a
yeah
yeah
fine
just
tell
me
jonathan
they
start
walking
around
toward
the
front
of
the
van
are
you
sure
with
all
of
this
stuff
that
we'll
be
able
to
watch
buffy
without
her
noticing
us
absolutely
i
mean
she'll
never
even
know
they
come
around
to
the
other
side
and
find
andrew
spraypainting
a
huge
death
star
on
the
side
of
the
van
wwhat
the
hell
is
that
death
star
dude
wicked
huh
jonathan
scornfully
thermal
exhaust
port's
above
the
main
port
numbnuts
for
your
information
i'm
using
the
empire's
revised
designs
from
return
of
the
jedi
that's
a
flawed
design
guys
warren
they
shut
up
okay
the
thing
is
since
we're
messing
with
the
slayer
who
could
pummel
the
three
of
us
into
a
sludgy
substance
it
might
be
a
good
idea
for
us
to
warren
yelling
not
draw
attention
to
ourselves
jonathan
nods
smugly
at
andrew
andrew
uncertain
i
could
paint
over
it
if
you
want
yeah
well
do
that
because
this
time
tomorrow
the
games
begin
warren
zoom
in
on
his
face
and
the
slayer
will
never
even
know
what
hit
her
wolf
howl
opening
credits
act
i

open
on
the
hallways
of
uc
sunnydale
various
students
walking
around
this
is
gonna
be
great
cut
to
buffy
and
willow
entering
a
classroom
i
thought
it
might
be
a
little
weird
being
back
i
mean
it
is
weird
but
like
a
good
kind
of
weird
instead
of
desks
the
classroom
has
long
tables
set
up
in
a
rectangle
they
walk
around
the
perimeter
to
find
empty
seats
there's
the
teacher
mike
shot
of
the
teacher
dressed
casually
writing
on
the
blackboard
the
words
social
construction
of
you'll
like
mike
willow
sits
you
call
your
teacher
mike
boy
school
sure
has
changed
since
my
day
buffy
sits
mike
turns
from
the
blackboard
the
final
word
he
wrote
was
reality
social
construction
of
reality
who
can
tell
me
what
that
is
mike
many
students
raise
their
hands
including
willow
rachel
a
concept
involving
a
couple
of
opposing
theories
one
stressing
the
externality
and
independence
of
social
reality
from
individuals
rachel
buffy
looks
confused
and
the
flip
side
mike
many
hands
raised
steve
that
each
individual
participates
fully
in
the
construction
of
his
or
her
own
life
good
and
who
can
expand
on
that
mike
hands
chuck
well
those
on
the
latter
side
of
the
theoretical
divide
stress
buffy
leans
toward
willow
and
whispers
will
i'm
not
following
this
too
well
oh
the
trick
is
to
get
in
the
rhythm
kinda
go
with
the
flow
willow
raises
her
hand
flowgoing
would
be
a
lot
easier
if
your
classmates
weren't
such
big
brains
willow
hand
still
raised
buffy
that's
ridiculous
they
are
no
smarter
than
you
or
me
mike
os
willow
willow
lowers
hand
speaks
to
mike
because
social
phenomena
don't
have
unproblematic
objective
existences
they
have
to
be
interpreted
and
given
meanings
by
those
who
encounter
them
willow
buffy
stares
at
willow
mike
os
nicely
put
so
ruby
does
that
mean
there
are
countless
realities
willow
notices
buffy's
look
what
cut
to
buffy
and
willow
walking
through
the
hallways
you're
not
dumb
just
rusty
maybe
i
should
ease
back
in
with
some
nontaxing
classes
like
introduction
to
pies
or
maybe
advanced
walking
tara
hurries
up
to
join
them
hey
how'd
it
go
she
did
fine
sociology
not
a
big
fave
she
didn't
like
mike
no
look
it's
fine
i
just
need
to
spend
a
little
more
time
reacclimating
you
know
to
get
back
into
the
swing
of
things
a
guy
bumps
buffy
as
he
walks
past
them
close
shot
of
a
hand
touching
her
clothing
moving
away
to
reveal
a
tiny
metal
object
cut
back
to
wider
shot
buffy
almost
falls
over
but
willow
and
tara
catch
her
willow
yells
after
the
guy
hey
you
could
at
least
say
sorry
rudeo
everybody's
in
a
hurry
the
girls
exchange
an
annoyed
look
and
continue
walking
cut
to
the
guy
coming
around
a
corner
we
see
that
it's
warren
he
looks
up
and
sees
a

stone
bench
circling

bumps
into
her
and
knocks

starts
crawling
toward

one
hits
her
and
she
falls
down
on
her
back

tiny
metal
device
attached
to

the
spirit
xander

pigignorant

and
a
little
hostile
xander

on

shoulder
and
starts

try

to
break
a
nail
the
guys
laugh
nastily
buffy
makes
a
face
mimicking
tony
and
walks
toward
the
pile
of
large
steel
girders
one
of
the
other
guys
vince
joins
her
don't
worry
about
it
and
don't
let
them
hassle
you
into
doing
something
stupid
and
hurting
yourself
these
beams
weigh
quite
a
few
hundred
pounds
buffy
picks
up
a
beam
easily
and
puts
it
on
her
shoulder
which
way
all
the
men
pause
to
stare
vince
points
his
thumb
toward
the
halffinished
building
thanks
she
carries
the
beam
off
as
vince
stares
at
the
remaining
pile
in
surprise
cut
to
inside
the
site
later
someone
is
welding
buffy
comes
in
carrying
another
girder
and
addresses
another
man
danny
who's
crouched
over
doing
something
so
basically
i'm
just
trying
to
learn
everything
i
can
you
know
'cause
i
don't
want
just
a
job
you
know
i
want
a
career
you
know
something
i
can
grow
into
she
goes
over
to
danny
who
is
trying
to
move
a
girder
buffy
easily
helps
him
lift
it
into
position
i
mean
i
never
thought
i'd
be
working
in
construction
but
when
you
think
about
it
kinda
makes
sense
hey
we
get
paid
by
the
hour
danny
buffy
looks
surprised
you
wanna
ruin
it
for
the
rest
of
us
slow
down
he
walks
off
leaving
buffy
standing
there
uncertainly
in
the
background
we
see
tony
watching
cut
to
a
view
of
the
construction
site
as
seen
through
binoculars
the
lens
follows
a
worker
along
until
we
see
buffy
in
the
background
the
lens
stops
and
focuses
in
on
her
ah

on
the
floor
reading
a
comic

andrew
tosses
the
comic
down
picks
up
a
set
of
wooden
pipes
and
begins
to
play
by
blowing
air
across
the
tops
of
them
the
music
continues
as
we
cut
to
buffy
approaching
a
water
cooler
on
the
site
she
leans
over
to
take
a
cup
she
hears
something
and
straightens
up
looks
around
in
confusion
the
music
continues
and
melds
into
the
background
music
of
the
scene
buffy
shrugs
turns
back
to
the
cooler
to
fill
her
cup
shot
of
buffy
from
someone
else's
pov
approaching
her
a
wrench
sits
on
a
nearby
stand
the
person
picks
it
up
and
carries
it
toward
buffy
she
sees
the
person
approaching
and
stands
up
too
quickly
spilling
water
on
herself
ooh

tony
the
foreman

suddenly
buffy
pushes
him
aside
to
reveal
a
green
demon
behind
him
tony
hits
the
wall
as
buffy
hits
the
demon
buffy
takes
off
her
hardhat
and
throws
it
aside
as
she
faces
the
demon
two
more
demons
drop
down
from

to
surround
buffy
they
are
all
greenskinned
and
wear
long
trenchcoats
buffy
kicks

to
her
knees
and
sweeps
the
feet
out
from
under

she
gets
in
a
couple
more
kicks
before
one
of
them
grabs
her
around
the
waist
from
behind
dragging
her
backward

the
demon's
arm
with

with
the
other
the
demon
tosses
her
backward

her
and
pins
her
against
a
wall
she
kicks
it
back
and
another
demon
takes
its
place
buffy
punches
it
a
few
times
turns
and
leaps
up
to
grab
an
overhead
bar
swinging
from
it
she
kicks
a
demon
in
front
and
one
behind
does
a
somersaulting
dismount
and
kicks
two
demons
with
both
feet
they
crash
into
a
partially
built
wall
bringing
it
down
buffy
picks
up
a
shovel
from
the
floor
and
uses
it
to
hit
the
other
demon
a
few
times
he
goes
down
and
she
stabs
the
shovel
into
him
then
drops
it
the
demon
lies
on
the
floor
dead
then
his
whole
body
turns
into
a
pile
of
goo
which
evaporates
completely
leaving
just
an
oily
stain
the
other
two
demons
get
up
pushing
pieces
of
wall

falls
to
the
ground
and
disintegrates
as

buffy
ducks
a
punch
from

it
back
against
a
piece
of
machinery
picks
it
up
and
shoves
its
head
into
the
machine
she
pulls
out
a
cable
and
the
pneumatic
machinery
begins
to
compress

the
demon's
head

counter
in
foreground
we
see
giles
carrying
a
large
stack
of
books
toward
the
round
table
buffy
approaches
him
we
see
that
the
table
is
already
piled
high
with
a
huge
number
of
books

table
picks
up
a
mug
i
just
want

this
time
anomaly

then
the
the

be
completely
unrelated
events

might
be
in
some
danger

major
one

a
human
skull

a
candle

can
illustrate
with
an
amusing
story
about
a
crystal
we

a
tiny
camera
mounted
in
one
of
the
skull's
eyes
cut
to
the
interior
of
the
van
a

yawning
in
boredom
as

watches
he
reaches
out
to
turn
down

a
bowl
in
the
middle
of
the
triangle
with
the
burning
paper
in
the
bowl
jonathan
waves
the
bone
over

gestures
with
his
other
hand
opus

approx
translation
the
work
is

to
rise
from
the
bowl
jonathan
grins
at
the

smoke
engulfs
them

they
all
begin
to
cough

to
inside
the
magic
shop
buffy

inexcusable
the
others
just
look
at
him
cut
to
spike
coming
out
of
the
bar
walking
quickly
waving
his
hands
in
annoyance

looking
at

approaches
the

where

suddenly
a
large
demon
comes
around

at

red
skin
curved
horns
and
wings
and
wears

a
loincloth

up
and
begins
to
drive
off

goes
over
to
the
demon
tries
to

gently
die
the
demon
throws
something
on
the
ground
which
causes
a
shower
of
sparks
and
a
cloud
of
smoke
then
he
turns
and
runs
away
buffy
and

proportional
strength
of
uh
