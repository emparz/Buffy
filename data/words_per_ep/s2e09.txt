sunnydale
high
school
the
career
fair
is
going
on
in
the
lounge
willow
comes
into
the
hall
from
outside
and
looks
around
at
some
of
the
displays
being
set
up
on
her
way
to
sign
up
for
the
career
aptitude
test
buffy
and
xander
are
already
sitting
at
a
table
filling
out
their
tests
xander
reads
'are
you
a
people
person
or
do
you
prefer
keeping
your
own
company'
well
what
if
i'm
a
people
person
who
keeps
his
own
company
by
default
willow
heads
for
their
table
with
a
test
to
join
them
so
mark
'none
of
the
above'
well
there
are
no
boxes
for
'none
of
the
above'
that
would
introduce
too
many
variables
into
their
mushroom
head
numbercrunching
little
world
willow
sits
i'm
sensing
bitterness
no
it's
just
these
people
can't
tell
from
one
multiplechoice
test
what
we're
gonna
be
doing
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
it's
ridiculous
willow
smiles
i'm
kinda
curious
to
find
out
what
sort
of
career
i
could
have
what
and
suck
all
the
spontaneity
out
of
being
young
and
stupid
i'd
rather
live
in
the
dark
you're
not
gonna
be
young
forever
yes
but
i'll
always
be
stupid
xander
smirks
and
looks
at
the
girls
okay
let's
not
all
rush
to
disagree
buffy
looks
up
at
him
seriously
you're
not
stupid
xander
gives
her
an
acknowledging
sarcastic
grin
then
looks
up
when
he
hears
cordelia
she
has
a
clipboard
and
is
taking
her
test
as
she
walks
into
the
lounge
accompanied
by
two
of
her
groupies
'i
aspire
to
help
my
fellow
man'
cordelia
marks
her
test
check
as
long
as
he's
not
smelly
dirty
or
something
gross
cordelia
walks
by
the
table
cordelia
chase
always
ready
to
give
a
helping
hand
to
the
rich
and
the
pretty
which
lucky
me
excludes
you
twice
xander
has
no
comeback
so
cordelia
just
walks
away
followed
closely
by
her
cronies
is
murder
always
a
crime
do
i
like
shrubs
that's
between
you
and
your
god
buffy
to
willow
what'd
you
put
i
came
down
on
the
side
of
shrubs
go
with
shrubs
okay
buffy
frustrated
uhhh
i
shouldn't
even
be
bothering
with
this
it's
all
mootville
for
me
no
matter
what
my
aptitude
test
says
we
already
know
my
deal
yup
high
risk
subminimum
wage
pointy
wooden
things
then
why
are
you
even
taking
the
test
it's
principal
snyder's
hoop
of
the
week
he's
not
happy
unless
i'm
jumping
believe
me
i
would
not
be
here
otherwise
you're
not
even
a
teensy
weensy
bit
curious
about
what
kinda
career
you
could've
had
i
mean
if
you
weren't
already
the
slayer
and
all
do
the
words
'sealed
in
fate'
ring
any
bells
for
you
will
why
go
there
willow
is
hurt
by
that
comment
y'know
with
that
kind
of
attitude
you
could've
had
a
bright
future
as
an
employee
at
the
dmv
xander
shakes
his
pencil
at
her
i'm
sorry
it's
just
unless
hell
freezes
over
and
every
vamp
in
sunnydale
puts
in
for
early
retirement
i'd
say
my
future
is
pretty
much
a
nonissue
cut
to
spike's
warehouse
drusilla
is
standing
at
one
end
of
a
large
table
dealing
her
tarot
cards
at
the
other
end
spike
is
looking
on
as
dalton
tries
to
translate
the
ancient
text
in
the
book
that
they
stole
from
the
library
read
it
again
well
i'm
not
sure
it
could
be
uh
dalton
shrugs
with
his
hands
deprimere
ille
bubula
linter
spike
paging
through
a
dictionary
debase
the
beef
canoe
dalton
looks
up
at
spike
and
smiles
a
stupid
smile
spike
cannot
abide
him
and
punches
him
in
the
face
why
does
that
strike
me
as
not
right
dalton
looks
at
him
sheepishly
and
turns
his
attention
back
to
the
book
spike
come
dance
drusilla
holds
out
her
hand
spike
angry
give
us
some
peace
would
you
can't
you
see
i'm
working
drusilla
pulls
back
her
hand
and
begins
to
pout
and
whine
like
a
puppy
oh
i'm
sorry
kitten
spike
goes
to
her
it's
just
this
manuscript
supposed
to
hold
your
cure
but
it
reads
like
gibberish
eeven
dalton
here
the
big
brain
he
can't
make
heads
or
tails
of
it
drusilla
puts
her
hand
to
her
head
i
i
i
need
to
change
miss
edith
she
takes
a
few
steps
and
then
puts
her
other
hand
to
her
head
as
well
bends
over
and
whines
spike
rushes
to
her
puts
his
arms
around
her
and
pulls
her
back
up
oh
forgive
me
you
know
i
can't
stand
to
see
you
like
this
spike
sits
her
down
and
crouches
we're
runnin'
out
of
time
it's
that
bloody
slayer
whenever
i
turn
around
she's
muckin'
up
the
works
drusilla
tries
to
comfort
him
back
shh
shh
you'll
make
it
right
i
know
spike
puts
his
hands
around
her
neck
and
kisses
her
gently
but
firmly
after
they
release
their
kiss
he
stands
up
again
and
turns
his
attention
back
to
dalton
drusilla
reaches
for
the
next
tarot
card
well
spike
walks
around
the
table
come
on
now
enlighten
me
uh
well
it
looks
like
latin
but
it's
not
ii'm
not
even
sure
it's
it's
a
language
actually
i
then
make
it
a
language
isn't
that
what
a
transcriber
does
well
not
exactly
he
yelps
as
spike
grabs
him
by
the
shirt
and
lifts
him
from
his
chair
i
want
the
cure
don't
why
not
some
people
find
pain
spike
punches
dalton
in
the
stomach
very
inspirational
dalton
doubles
over
drusilla
looks
up
from
her
cards
he
can't
help
you
drusilla
looks
back
at
her
cards
not
without
drusilla
points
at
a
card
the
key
the
key
you
mean
this
book
is
in
some
kind
of
code
yeah
dalton
nods
weakly
still
in
pain
spike
shoves
him
back
into
his
chair
and
walks
over
to
drusilla
he
looks
at
one
of
her
cards
a
mausoleum
is
pictured
on
it
is
that
where
we'll
find
this
key
yeah
i'll
send
the
boys
pronto
now
will
you
dance
drusilla
smiles
spike
smiles
and
takes
her
hand
i'll
dance
with
you
pet
he
pulls
her
up
from
her
chair
and
lifts
her
into
his
arms
on
the
slayer's
grave
he
starts
to
spin
around
with
her
in
his
arms
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

the
cemetery
buffy
walks
through
it
at
a
relaxed
pace
she
pauses
for
a
moment
but
continues
on
scanning
the
graveyard
around
her
as
she
goes
she
stops
again
when
she
hears
clinking
noises
coming
from
a
mausoleum
she
looks
at
it
and
sees
light
coming
from
inside
she
walks
over
to
it
pushes
the
door
open
a
bit
and
peeks
in
dalton
is
chipping
away
at
the
wall
exposing
a
chamber
behind
it
he
reaches
in
for
something
as
buffy
pulls
her
head
back
out
and
closes
the
door
she
walks
down
the
steps
and
turns
around
to
wait
for
him
to
come
out
a
few
moments
later
dalton
opens
the
door
and
steps
out
does
'rest
in
peace'
have
no
sanctity
to
you
people
oh
i
forgot
you're
not
a
people
another
vampire
comes
up
behind
her
she
senses
him
turns
around
and
kicks
him
in
the
gut
then
the
jaw
then
again
in
the
gut
he
takes
a
swing
at
her
but
she
grabs
his
arm
and
punches
him
twice
in
the
face
he
swings
at
her
with
his
other
arm
but
she
ducks
and
catches
it
too
she
yanks
it
back
and
it
can
be
heard
snapping
while
she
has
him
leaning
back
she
thrusts
a
stake
into
his
heart
he
explodes
into
ashes
one
down
buffy
turns
and
sees
dalton
missing
one
gone
she
looks
around
but
sees
no
sign
of
him
anywhere
cut
to
buffy's
room
angel
is
there
and
he
looks
around
while
he
waits
for
her
to
get
home
buffy
climbs
up
to
her
window
and
looks
in
she
sees
him
looking
into
her
bookcase
angel
takes
her
stuffed
pig
from
the
shelf
without
a
word
buffy
reaches
for
her
bag
and
tosses
it
loudly
through
the
window
and
onto
the
floor
angel
turns
around
startled
he
gently
squeezes
the
pig
buffy
you
scared
me
buffy
climbs
in
now
you
know
what
it
feels
like
stealth
guy
she
crouches
down
by
her
bag
and
reaches
into
her
hair
to
pull
out
a
few
clips
just
dropping
by
for
some
quality
time
with
mr
gordo
angel
confused

the
pig
buffy
opens
her
trunk
and
dumps
the
bag
in
oh

chuckles
i
uh

walks
to
her
desk

tosses
the
pig
onto
a
chair
and
walks
to
the
foot
of
her
bed

drops
her

a
desk
drawer

tired
of
the

about

stunned
as
in

polyester
doughnuts
and
brutality
buffy
whines
but
willow
smiles
doughnuts
buffy
whines
louder
well
i'll
just
jump
off
that
bridge
when
i
come
to
it
she
spots
giles
walking
along
with
a
tall
stack
of
old
books
in
his
arms
first
i
have
to
deal
with
giles
he's
on
this
tony
robbins
hyperefficiency
kick
expects
me
to
check
in
every
day
after
homeroom
buffy
walks
off
after
giles
police
xander
starts
to
follow
but
willow
holds
him
back
you
didn't
check
to
see
which
seminar
i
was
assigned
to
did
you
i
did
and
you
weren't
i
wasn't
what
on
the
list
but
i
handed
in
my
test
i
used
a
number
two
pencil
then
i
guess
you
musta
passed
it's
not
the
kinda
test
you
pass
or
fail
your
name
wasn't
up
there
will
willow
is
a
bit
taken
aback
cut
to
the
library
giles
walks
to
the
table
balancing
his
stack
of
books
he
carefully
sets
them
down
and
leans
over
a
bit
to
straighten
the
stack
but
overleans
and
the
books
begins
to
fall
over
he
reacts
quickly
to
try
to
stop
them
ah
buffy
puts
her
hand
on
top
of
the
stack
just
as
he
does
and
they
push
it
back
up
giles
is
relieved
giles
exhales
buffy
thank
you
giles
she
sits
i've
been
uh
indexing
the
watcher
diaries
covering
the
last
couple
of
centuries
you
would
be
amazed
at
how
numbingly
pompous
and
longwinded
some
of
these
watchers
were
color
me
stunned
so
uh
i
trust
last
night's
patrol
was
fruitful
semi
mm
i
caught
one
out
of
two
vamps
after
they
stole
something
from
this
jumbo
mausoleum
they
were
stealing
yeah
they
had
tools
flashlights
whole
nine
yards
what
does
that
mean
anyway
'whole
nine
yards'
buffy
giles
begins
to
pace
nine
yards
of
what
buffy
whines
now
it's
gonna
bug
me
all
day
giles
you're
in
pace
mode
what
gives
um
this
vampire
who
escaped
did
you
see
what
he
took
no
but
i
could
take
a
guess
and
say
it
was
something
old
you
made
no
effort
to
find
out
what
was
taken
have
a
cow
giles
i
just
figured
it
was
your
everyday
vamp
hijinks
well
what
if
it
wasn't
this
could
be
very
serious
i
mean
i
iif
you'd
made
an
effort
to
uh
to
be
more
thorough
in
your
observations
y'know
if
you
don't
like
the
way
i'm
doing
my
job
why
don't
you
find
somebody
else
oh
that's
right
there
can
only
be
one
as
long
as
i'm
alive
there
is
no
one
else
well
there
you
go
i
don't
have
to
be
the
slayer
i
could
be
dead
that
wasn't
terribly
funny
you
notice
i
don't
laugh
wouldn't
be
much
of
a
change
either
way
i'm
bored
constricted
i
never
get
to
shop
and
my
hair
and
fingernails
still
continue
to
grow
so
really
when
you
think
about
it
what's
the
diff
do
we
have
to
be
introspective
now
our
only
concern
is
to
discover
what
was
stolen
from
that
mausoleum
last
night
cut
to
drusilla's
room
she
waves
her
hand
over
an
intricately
carved
gold
cross
held
out
to
her
by
spike
on
a
red
velvet
pillow
this
is
it
then
drusilla
senses
it
hums
i
can
hear
it
once
you're
well
again
we'll
have
a
coronation
down
main
street
and
invite
everyone
and
drink
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
dalton
behind
them
what
about
the
slayer
she
almost
blew
the
whole
thing
for
us
she's
trouble
spike
looks
at
him
you
don't
say
spike
gets
up
trouble
spike
paces
she's
the
gnat
in
my
ear
the
gristle
in
my
teeth
she's
the
bloody
thorn
in
my
bloody
side
kicks
the
table
violently
drusilla
concerned
spike
we
gotta
do
something
we'll
never
complete
your
cure
with
that
bitch
breathing
down
our
necks
spike
exhales
i
need
to
bring
in
the
big
guns
they'll
take
care
of
her
once
and
for
all
big
guns
the

drusilla

three

one
is
of
a
cyclops
another
of

party
drusilla
looks
up
three
of
them
spike
walks
back
to
the
bed
to
look
at
the
cards
uh
yes
but
the
order
of

to
a
curtainedoff
area
of
the
lounge
they
pull
the
curtain
aside
for

she
steps
through
and
they
follow
her
letting

curtain
fall

recruiter

back
the
test
was
irrelevant
we've
been
tracking
you
for
some
time
is
that
a
good
thing
i
would
think
so
we're
extremely
selective
in
fact
only
one
other
sunnydale
student
met
our
criteria
without
another
word
the
two
recruiters
turn
and
leave
through
the
curtain
willow
is
a
bit
stunned
but
stays
and
turns
around
to
see
who
the
other
student
is
oz
is
sitting
there
on
the
couch
studying
another
tray
of
canape'
she
steps
over
to
the
couch
and
sits
down
on
the
other
end
she
folds
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
looks
over
at
oz
he
notices
someone
sit
and
turns
to
look
when
he
sees
her
he
does
a
double
take
and
realizes
she's
the
girl
he's
noticed
twice
before
he
looks
down
at
the
tray
in
his
hand
and
offers
it
to
her
canape'
cut
to
a
cemetery
entrance
buffy
swings
open
the
metal

catch
his
breath
from
running
after

imimmaturely

but
remember
i'm
the
picked
what

is
more
than

a
sacred

shouldn't
prevent
you
from
ee
eventually
procuring
some
giles
pants
more
giles

gainful
ffform
of

uhuhuh
such
as
i
did
uh
giles
it's
one
thing
to
be
a
watcher
and
a
librarian
they
go
together
like
chicken
and
another
chicken
or
two
chickens
or
something
you
know
what
i'm
saying
the
point
is
no
one
blinks
an
eye
if
you
want
to
spend
all
your
days
with
books
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
carve
stakes
for
a
nursery
giles
has
gotten
in
front
of
her
as
they
make
their
way
past
several
gravestones
um
point
taken
i
must
however
admit
ii've
never
really
well
now
there's
a
thought
have
you
ever
considered
law
enforcement
buffy
stops
in
her
tracks
as
giles
turns
to
face
her
she
looks
at
him
like
he's
crazy
a
moment
later
her
expression
changes
to
exasperation
and
she
raises
her
flashlight
and
jerks
it
at
the
mausoleum
behind
him
what
giles
turns
to
look
oh
they
walk
up
the
steps
and
go
in
cut
inside
the
chamber
is
bare
except
for
two
large
stone
vases
and
a
pile
of
rubble
on
the
floor
they
come
down
the
steps
may
i
giles
reaches
for
the
flashlight
buffy
hands
it
to
him
be
my
guest
he
turns
on
the
flashlight
and
walks
over
to
where
the
wall
has
been
broken
into
it's
a
reliquary
used
to
house
items
of
religious
significance
most
commonly
a
finger
or
some
other
body
part
from
a
saint
note
to
self
religion
freaky
she
leans
against
the
wall
as
giles
scans
around
the
rest
of
the
room
with
the
flashlight
he
spots
a
name
engraved
on
a
stone
high
above
du
lac
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
hate
when
you
say
that
josephus
du
lac
was
buried
here
he
belonged
to
a
religious
sect
that
was
excommunicated
by
the
vatican
at
the
turn
of
the
century
excommunicated
and
sent
to
sunnydale
there's
a
guy
big
with
the
sinning
you
remember
the
book
that
was
stolen
from
the
library
by
a
vampire
a
few
weeks
ago
yeah
it
was
written
by
du
lac
damn
it
i
let
it
slip
my
mind
with
all
the
excitement
i'm
guessing
it
wasn't
a
'taste
of
the
vatican'
cookbook
they
start
out
of
the
mausoleum
no
the
uh
book
was
said
to
contain
rituals
and
spells
that
reap
unspeakable
evil
however
it
was
written
in
archaic
latin
so
that
nobody
but
the
sect
members
could
understand
it
cut
outside
so
everything's
cool
then
it's
not
first
the
book
was
taken
from
the
library
and
now
the
vampires
have
stolen
something
from
du
lac's
tomb
you
think
they
figured
out
how
to
read
the
book
something's
coming
buffy
and
whatever
it
is
i
can
guarantee
it's
not
good
cut
to
the
sunnydale
bus
depot
the
camera
pans
from
the
depot
building
to
a
bus
just
arriving
as
the

being
made

continuing
service
to

arriving

at
the
west

the
doors
of
the

open
and
the
passengers
begin
to
file
out
cut
to
the
bottom
step
of
the
bus
a
pair
of
heavy
steeltoed
boots
stops
on
the
step
the
camera
pans
up
the
man's
body
past
his
leather
jacket
and
long
hair
to
his
face
a
scar
runs
across
his
left
eye
apparently
blinded
by
an
injury
he
looks
around
and
steps
off
of
the
bus
cut
to
the
street
in
front
of
the
summers
house
a
salesman
comes
walking
along
the
street
carrying
a
large
case
and
eyes
the
'summers'
nameplate
hanging
from
their
mailbox
he
looks
up
at
the
house
but
continues
past
to
the
next
house
and
walks
up
to
the
front
door
he
knocks
and
a
woman
answers
mrs
kalish
yes

norman
pfister
with
norman
holds
up
the
case
blush
beautiful
skin
care
i'm
not
selling
anything
so
i'm
not
asking
you
to
buy
just
to
accept
a
few
free
samples
mrs
kalish
takes
off
her
glasses
free
absolutely
mrs
kalish
looks
him
up
and
down
and
nods
him
into
her
home
he
walks
in
and
she
follows
him
closing
the
door
behind
her
the
camera
closes
in
on
the
door
and
mrs
kalish
screams
loudly
cut
to
the
airport
mrs
kalish's
scream
blends
into
the
noise
of
a
747
flying
overhead
as
it
comes
in
for
a
landing
cut
to
a
view
of
the
tarmac
several
jets
are
parked
at
their
gates
cut
inside
the
cargo
bay
of
a
jet
the
cargo
door
opens
and
a
baggage
handler
comes
up
the
loading
ramp
and
steps
in
he
notices
that
the
cargo
nets
have
been
torn
open
and
takes
off
his
headphones
what
the
hell
he
looks
closer
and
suspects
someone's
there
hey
you're
not
supposed
to
be
in
here
he
pulls
out
his
flashlight
and
holds
it
ready
to
use
as
a
club
hey
c'mon
he
walks
in
further
looking
for
whoever
it
is
he
sees
a
shadow
moving
behind
a
baggage
container
suddenly
a
foot
comes
up
and
kicks
him
in
the
face
in
the
gut
and
again
in
the
face
he
falls
onto
his
back
unconscious
the
person
walks
toward
the
cargo
door
and
peeks
out
it's
a
young
caribbean
girl
with
long
curly
hair
tied
back
and
large
hoop
earrings
she
makes
her
way
out
of
the
plane
keeping
a
careful
watch
for
anyone
who
might
see
her
cut
to
the
school
cut
to
the
library
willow
buffy
and
xander
are
sitting
at
the
table
so
giles
is
sure
that
the
vampire
who
stole
his
book
is
connected
to
the
one
you
slayed
last
night
or
is
it
slew
giles
comes
out
of
the
stacks
with
a
national
geographic
magazine
both
are
correct
and
yes
i'm
sure
du
lac
was
both
a
a
a
theologian
and
a
mathematician
giles
comes
down
the
stairs
this
article
describes
an
invention
of
his
which
he
called
'the
du
lac
cross'
so
why
go
to
all
the
trouble
of
inventing
something
and
then
giving
it
a
weak
name
like
that
i
mean
i'da
gone
with
'the
crosso
matic'
or
uh
'the
amazing
mr
cross'
the
girls
just
stare
at
him
he
looks
up
at
giles
and
nods
giles
doesn't
think
his
musings
are
funny
either
the
cross
was
more
than
a
mere
symbol
giles
hands
the
open
magazine
to
willow
it
was
used
to
understand
certain
mystical
texts
to
uh
decipher
hidden
meanings
and
so
forth
so
you're
saying
these
vampires
went
to
all
this
hassle
for
your
basic
decoder
ring
giles
taken
aback
by
the
metaphor
uh
actually
yes
i
i
suppose
i
am
according
to
this
du
lac
destroyed
every
cross
except
the
one
buried
with
him
why
destroy
your
own
work
giles
paces
perhaps
he
feared
what
might
happen
if
it
fell
into
the
wrong
hands
a
fear
we'll
soon
get
to
experience
for
ourselves
up
close
and
personal
uunless
we
can
preempt
their
plans
how
uh
by
learning
what's
in
the
book
before
they
do
which
means
we
can
expect
to
be
here
later
tonight
giles
sits
willow
smiles
broadly
goody
research
party
will
you
need
a
life
in
the
worst
way
buffy
gets
up
speaking
of
i
really
have
to
bail
but
i
promise
i'll
be
back
bright
and
early
tomorrow
and
ready
to
slay
this
is
a
matter
of
some
urgency
buffy
i
realize
that
well
you
have
to
admit
i
kinda
lack
in
the
book
area
i
mean
you
guys
are
the
brains
i'd
only
be
here
for
moral
support
anyway
that's
untrue
buffy
you
totally
contribute
you
go
for
snacks
buffy
looks
to
willow
for
help
she
should
go
yy'know
gather
her
strength
perhaps
you're
right
there
may
be
fierce
battles
ahead
buffy
makes
tracks
for
the
door
but
hohos
are
a
vital
part
of
my
cognitive
process
buffy
smiles
back
at
him
sorry
xand
someplace
i
have
to
be
giles
and
xander
give
each
other
a
look
cut
to
the
ice
skating
rink
the
place
is
empty
except
for
buffy
skating
gracefully
by
herself
she
makes
use
of
the
whole
rink
doing
practiced
turns
and
spins
a
minute
later
buffy
skates
quickly
by
the
staging
area
and
the
camera
stops
to
focus
on
a
stage
panel
begin
pushed
open
the

skates
along

by

she
does
a
crouching
maneuver
but
wipes
out
and
slides
backward
against
the
sidewall
as
she
starts
to
get
up
the
bounty

reaches
down
puts
his
arm
around
her
neck
and
lifts
her
off
of
the

lays
her
down
on
the

and
begins
to
choke
her
buffy
tries
to
pry
his
hands
from
her
throat
as
she
struggles
to
breathe
angel
comes
running
across
the

sporting
his
game

buffy
he
leaps
and
tackles
the
bounty
hunter
knocking
him
off
of

she
falls
from

railing
onto
the

with
her
knee
angel
lifts
the
bounty
hunter
to
his
feet
and
punches
him
in

the

isn't
fazed
and
returns
with
a
doublefisted
punch
to
angel's
stomach
sending
him
back
into
the

angel
comes
off
the
wall
and
jabs
him
in
the
face
again
but
the
bounty
hunter
just
shrugs
it
off
he
punches
angel
in
the
face
and
gut
making
him
stagger
into
the
wall
again
the
bounty
hunter
grabs
angel
by
the
throat
and
lifts
him
up
buffy
comes
skating
toward
them
at
a
fast
pace
the
bounty
hunter
turns
to
face
her
she
grabs
a
net
that's
hanging
there
and
uses
it
to
swing
up
with
her
foot
and
hit
him
in
the
throat
with
the
blade
of
her
skate
crushing
his
trachea
he
lets
go
of
angel
and
grabs
his
own
neck
unable
to
breathe
he
takes
a
few
steps
onto
the
ice
and
collapses
there

feet

close
to
decoding
the
manuscript
we
just
need
a
bit
more
time
time
is
ours
it
brings
the
slayer
closer
to
them
the
camera
pans
from
the
face
down
card
over
to
the
other
two
still
turned
face
up
cut
to
the
skating
rink
buffy
rubs
her
knee
angel
crouches
over
the
bounty
hunter
and
lifts
his
hand
to
inspect
his
ring
the
hellmouth
presents
dead
guys
on
ice
not
exactly
the
evening
we
were
aiming
for
angel
looks
closely
at
the
ring
you're
in
danger
you
know
what
the
ring
means
i
just
killed
a
super
bowl
champ
angel
annoyed
i'm
serious
you
should
go
home
and
wait
until
you
hear
from
me
he
drops
the
bounty
hunter's
hand
and
stands
up
he
still
has
his
game
face
on
buffy
skates
over
to
him
are
you
okay
she
puts
her
gloved
hand
on
his
cheek
and
sees
the
cut
above
his
eye
what
about
you
that
cut
buffy
lowers
her
hand
forget
about
me
this
is
bad
buffy
we
gotta
get
you
outta
here
what
you
mean
hide
let's
just
get
you
someplace
safe
no
your
eye
she
reaches
back
up
to
him
and
he
shakes
her
off
hey
don't
be
a
baby
i'm
not
gonna
hurt
you
it's
not
that
i
what
you
shouldn't
have
to
touch
me
when
i'm
like
this
she
looks
up
into
his
vampire
features
oh
she
removes
her
glove
and
reaches
up
to
touch
his
brow
and
his
wound
brushing
gently
across
and
down
his
cheek
i
didn't
even
notice
she
moves
closer
to
kiss
him
he
responds
and
they
kiss
gently
the
kiss
becomes
more
passionate
as
she
reaches
her
hand
behind
his
neck
to
draw
him
closer
off
to
the
side
the
girl
from
the
airport
walks
up
and
stops
observing
their
kiss
angel
puts
his
arms
around
buffy
and
she
rises
up
onto
the
tips
of
her
skates
to
get
even
closer
cut
to
the
library
giles
inspects
the
ring
under
a
magnifying
lamp
buffy
is
sitting
on
the
steps
holding
an
icepack
to
her
knee
willow
and
xander
are
at
the
table
this
guy
was
hardcore
giles
and
angel
was
powerfreaked
by
that
ring
i'm
afraid
he
was
not
overreacting
this
ring
is
worn
only
by
members
of
the
order
of
taraka
it's
a
society
of
deadly
assassins
dating
back
to
king
solomon
giles
sits
and
didn't
they
beat
the
elks
this
year
in
the
sunnydale
adult
bowling
league
championships
their
credo
is
to
sow
discord
and
kill
the
unwary
bowling
is
a
vicious
game
giles
very
annoyed
that's
enough
xander
xander
looks
down
in
shame
buffy
and
willow
look
concerned
and
upset
sorry
it's
just
not
the
time
for
jokes
i
need
to
think
giles
takes
off
his
glasses
these
assassins
why
are
they
after
me
'cause
you're
the
scourge
of
the
underworld
i
haven't
been
that
scourgey
lately
giles
rubbing
his
eyes
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
giles
exhales
i
think
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
find
a
secure
location
somewhere
out
of
the
way
you
can
go
until
we
decide
on
the
best
course
of
action
buffy
gets
up
okay
now
you
and
angel
have
both
said
to
head
for
the
hills
are
you
saying
i
can't
handle
this
that
i'm
not
strong
enough
to
fight
these
people
they're
a
breed
apart
buffy
uunlike
vampires
they
have
no
earthly
desires
giles
willow
listens
in
shock
but
to
collect
their
bounty
they
find
a
target
and
uh
they
eliminate
it
giles
buffy
absorbs
this
solemnly
you
can
kill
as
many
of
them
as
you
like
it
won't
make
any
difference
where
there's
one
there
will
be
another
and
another
they
won't
stop
coming
until
the
job
is
done
cut
to
a
view
of
buffy's
house
through
binoculars
from
mrs
kalish's
house
each
one
of
them
works
alone
cut
to
norman
looking
through
his
binoculars
his
own
way
cut
to
the
floor
mrs
kalish
is
lying
there
dead
a
trail
of
mealworms
leads
from
her
over
to
norman

in
a
chair
some
are
human
some
aare
not
yyou
won't

until
they

norman
takes
the
binoculars
from
his
eyes
there
are
mealworms
crawling
over
his
shoes
his
hand
and
part
of
his
forearm
are
missing
and
the
mealworms
crawl
all
over
it
they
quickly
form
a
hand
and
it
takes
on
the
appearance
of
human
skin
he
reaches
over
to
a
cup
of
tea
and
lifts
it
to
take
a
sip
cut
to
the
halls
at
school
buffy
is
wigged
and
tense
as
she
walks
down
the
hall
she
holds
her
hands
to
the
back
of
her
neck
and
shoulders
she
jumps
when
a
boy
barges
through
the
doors
in
the
hall
in
front
of
her
she
walks
through
the
doors
and
scans
the
students
in
the
hall
paranoid
about
them
looking
at
her
the
police
recruiter
looks
at
her
and
she
stares
back
a
teacher
comes
down
the
stairs
in
front
of
her
and
looks
at
her
as
he
runs
a
comb
through
his
hair
several
students
walk
past
her
giving
her
the
occasional
glance
behind
her
oz
comes
walking
at
a
quick
pace
she
hears
a
locker
slam
behind
her
and
spins
toward
the
noise
notices
oz
quickly
bearing
down
on
her
takes
him
by
the
neck
and
shoves
him
into
the
wall
try
it
oz
confused
try
what
she
realizes
she's
made
a
mistakes
and
lets
go
of
his
neck
uh
buffy
exhales
ii'm
sorry
still
not
clear
what
i'm
supposed
to
try
nothing
god
i'm
sorry
i
she
steps
away
from
him
looks
both
ways
down
the
hall
and
quickly
heads
off
in
the
direction
she
was
going
oz
moves
away
from
the
wall
and
shudders
that
is
a
tense
person
cut
to
buffy's
street
at
night
buffy
walks
home
alone
arms
crossed
and
scanning
the
area
around
her
when
she
reaches
her
house
she
stops
and
just
stares
at
it
she
thinks
better
of
going
inside
looks
around
again
and
continues
on
cut
to
the
library
giles
walks
out
of
his
office
cleaning
his
glasses
willow
is
sitting
at
the
counter
going
through
a
volume
i
wish
there
was
more
we
could
do
we're
doing
all
that
we
can
giles
puts
on
his
glasses
the
only
course
of
action
is
to
try
and
find
out
what
was
in
that
stolen
book
giles
reads
a
card
from
the
catalog
i've
never
seen
buffy
like
that
she
just
took
off
xander
coming
in
well
she
didn't
go
home
i
let
the
phone
ring
a
few
hundred
times
before
i
remembered
her
mom
is
out
of
town
well
maybe
buffy
unplugged
the
phone
no
it's
a
statistical
impossibility
for
a
sixteenyearold
girl
to
unplug
her
phone
willow
nods
in
agreement
well
perhaps
my
words
of
caution
were
a
little
too
alarming
xander
with
heavy
sarcasm
ya
think
it's
good
that
she
took
you
seriously
giles
i
just
wish
we
knew
where
she
was
cut
to
the
hall
outside
angel's
apartment
buffy
comes
down
the
stairs
and
walks
over
to
his
door
there's
no
answer
when
she
knocks
angel
she
tries
the
doorknob
but
it's
locked
cut
inside
she
twists
the
knob
hard
breaking
it
and
opening
the
door
she
slowly
comes
in
has
a
look
around
and
closes
the
door
she
turns
on
the
lights
the
apartment
is
sparsely
furnished
a
modern
desk
strewn
with
papers
is
against
the
far
wall
with
a
dozen
old
pictures
hanging
on
the
wall
around
it
the
floor
is
bare
concrete
and
her
heels
click
quietly
as
she
slowly
walks
over
to
an
ivory
statue
enclosed
in
a
glass
display
case
she
looks
at
it
a
moment
before
going
on
she
looks
around
as
she
continues
and
passes
an
elegant
antique
armoire
finally
she
finds
his
unmade
bed
and
slowly
goes
over
to
it
and
sits
down
she
takes
a
deep
breath
and
lets
it
out
slowly
weary
from
the
day's
events
a
moment
later
she
lays
herself
down
on
the
bed
resting
her
head
on
his
pillow
and
curling
up
she
hugs
her
arms
close
to
her
heart
and
falls
asleep

sleazy
bar

falls
back
onto

dazed
and
looks
up
at
his
attacker

the
girl
from

rolls
out
of
the
way
of
the
girl's
thrust
willy
takes
the
opportunity
to
flee
the
bar
angel
is
up
again
and
he
ducks
a
swing
from
her
she
tries
a
direct
thrust
which
angel
just
pushes
aside
but
she
follows
it
up
with
a
punch
to
the
face
from
her
other
hand
and
uses
her
momentum
to
spin
around
for
a
roundhouse
kick
knocking
him
through
the
door
into
the
back
room
he
crashes
into
several
cases
of
beer
when
he
gets
back
up
he's
vamped
out
the
girl
charges
him
with
the
stake
held
above
her
head
in
both
hands
he
blocks
her
charge
with
his
arms
and
twists
her
arms
down
forcing
her
to
drop
the
stake
and
shoves
her
into
a
bank
of
lockers
he
tries
to
knock
her
legs
out
from
under
her
but
her
footing
is
firm
and
she
kicks
him
in
the
back
knocking
him
down
instead
once
down
he
tries
kicking
again
and
this
time
makes
her
fall
she
grabs
his
shirt
pulls
him
up
a
bit
and
kicks
him
in
the
face
they
both
scramble
to
their
feet
angel
swings
and
misses
he
swings
the
other
way
but
she
blocks
it
and
punches
him
three
times
in
the
gut
and
then
a
right
hook
to
his
jaw
she
shoves
him
into
the
door
of
the
cage
he
bounces
off
of
it
and
she
kicks
him
in

she
takes
spike's
hand
and
pulls
it
down
to
her
deck
of
tarot

the

is
a
picture
of

so
now
i'm

he
takes
the
steps
up
to
the
porch
and
