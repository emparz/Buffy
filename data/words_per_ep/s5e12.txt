sadly
at

have
belonged
to

that
xander's
right
wrist
is
in
a
cast
after
having
been
broken
in
'triangle'
um
aren't
we
supposed
to

a
meeting
uh
yes
yes
we
we're
here
for
a
reason
giles
buffy
sits
i've
had
some
rather
uh
well
i've
had
some
news
it
seems
that
the
council
of
watchers
has
found
some
information
that
may
help
us
out
about
glory
presumably
we'll
find
that
out
when
they
arrive
could
be
very
important
arrive
they're
coming
here
now
wwhy
do
they
have
to
come
here
yeah
don't
they
have
phones
xander
fake
british
accent
'allo
buffy
here's
some
stuff
we
know
pip
pip'
yeah
phones
see
i'd
like
them
on
phones
well
what's
so
bad
about
them
coming
here
aren't
they
good
guys
i
mean
watchers
that's
just
like
other
gileses
right
yeah
they're
scary
and
horrible
um
they
well
they
can
appear
a
bit
well
uh
hardnosed
but
uh
well
essentially
their
agenda
is
the
same
as
ours
they
want
to
save
the
world
and
kill
demons
kill
the
current
demons
right
current
demons
giles
i
don't
want
them
to
come
here
i
don't
trust
them
make
them
not
come
here
they're
probably
already
on
their
way
our
old
friend
quinton
travers
is
heading
up
the
delegation
they
put
me
through
that
test
and
it
almost
killed
me
and
then
when
i
was
faith
they
almost
killed
me
again
honestly
i
really
can't
handle
almost
being
killed
right
now
i
don't
like
the
sound
of
this
they
don't
sound
very
exdemoncompatible
are
you
sure
they're
english
ii
thought
english
people
were
um
gentler
then
uh
tara
trailing
off
normal
maybe
it
won't
be
so
bad
this
time
i
mean
buffy
they
did
think
you
were
faith
last
time
now
that
they
know
you're
just
you
maybe
they
won't
care
enough
to
kill
you
it's
not
just
that
they're
gonna
screw
everything
up
iit's
a
delicate
time
right
now
ii
have
to
take
care
of
dawn
and
but
that's
not
new
you've
always
taken
care
of
her
right
right
i
i
know
that
it's
just
you
know
there's
there's
glory
and
we
see
dawn
on
the
stairs
listening
in
wearing
pajamas
buffy
os
and
i
don't
need
the
council
looking
over
my
shoulder
when
i
don't
even
know
what
we're
dealing
with
giles
os
well
that's
precisely
why
we
need
to
talk
to
them
joyce
comes
down
the
stairs
and
sees
dawn
dawn
honey
what
are
you
doing
up
at
this
hour
go
back
to
bed
cut
back
to
living
room
buffy
hears
joyce
and
looks
alarmed
dawn
os
i
was
just
getting
a

yelling
over
her
shoulder
dawn

goes
back
upstairs
cut
back
to
living
room
buffy
alarmed
to
giles
she
was
listening
does
it
matter
i
mean
is
she
really
gonna
set
the
junior
high
school
buzzing
with
'ooh

a
delegation
acoming'
no
i
i
guess
not
you
know
it's
just
sometimes
we
say
stuff
and
and
it's
all
good
giles
you
were
saying
something
um
just
that
if
the
council
knows
something
about
glory
her
agenda
or
her
origins
then

giles
sighs
then
maybe
it
will
help
us
get
a
a
a
grip
on
what
we're
dealing
with
right
now
i
think
we're
we're
a
bit
lost
cut
to
glory
sitting
on
the
floor
of
her
apartment
panting
and
sweaty
looking
pale
and
in
pain
the
door
bursts
open
and
dreg
enters
with
another
demon
who
looks
like
him
jinx
they
are
dragging
a
man
in
postal
carrier
uniform
mistress
at
last
we've
found
one
they
throw
him
to
the
floor
next
to
glory
look
don't
hurt
me
i
beg
of
you
if
you
just
let
me
go
i
swear
i
won't
tell
anyone
dreg
pulls
him
upright
dreg
to
jinx
help
her
jinx
goes
to
glory
and
drags
her
toward
the
mailman
we're
here
for
you
great
one
glory
gets
up
on
her
knees
and
the
demons
put
her
hands
on
the
mailman's
head
what
drink
oh
what
is
this
what
the
what
the
hell
are
you
things
doing
to
me
glory
puts
her
fingers
on
the
sides
of
his
head
and
then
pushes
them
into
his
head
instead
of
blood
yellow
light
streams
out
as
glory
pushes
her
hands
deeper
into
his
brain
both
glory
and
the
mailman
scream
after
a
moment
the
light
stops
and
they
both
fall
to
the
floor
very
good
delicious
glory
lies
on
the
floor
panting
and
smiling
she
no
longer
looks
pale
or
sweaty
jinx
moves
toward
her
but
she
stops
him
no
i'm
good
it's
okay
she
looks
at
the
mailman
in
disgust
smacks
the
side
of
his
head
he
sits
up
then
stands
i
know
you're
all
always
looking
at
me
i
can
tell
always
tell
i
can
see
i
my
hat
where's
my
hat
mailman
wanders
off
glory
groans
laughs
try
not
cutting
things
so
close
next
time
understood
yes
we
live
to
serve
as
always
cool
glory
to
dreg
take
this
mess
out
with
the
rest
of
the
trash
glory
dreg
moves
away
and
you

glory
jinx
takes
her
hand
helps
her
up
have
something
to
tell
me
indeed
glorificus
glory
smiling
well
i'm
waiting
glory
picks
up
a
handmirror
and
rubs
lipstick
off
her
teeth
we
have
found
that
the
signs
of
the
alignment
are
moving
faster
than
expected
glory
primping
in
mirror
meaning
if
you
are
to
use
the
key
you
must
act
quickly
fine
glory
puts
mirror
down
i
have
been
cooling
my
heels
in
this
crappy
little
town
long
enough
glory
lies
down
on
bed
sunnydale's
got
too
many
demons
and
not
enough
retail
outlets
glory
picks
up
a
pair
of
shoes
all
you
need
is
the
key
glory
lying
on
her
back
yes
and
i
bet
mousy
the
vampire
slayer
has
an
idea
where
it
is
if
i
may
remind
your
eminence
you
don't
have
much
time
glory
scoffs
baby
if
that
girl's
the
only
thing
between
me
and
my
key
i
don't
need
much
time
wolf
howl
opening
credits
act
i

fade
in
on
magic
shop
giles
is
talking
to
a
female
customer
he
is
holding
two
books
well
if
you're
serious
about
these
matters
all
right
but
you
need
to
be
very
careful
measure
precisely
and
and
please
don't
step
ahead
travers
os
no
he's
quite
right
we
see
quinton

standing
there
with
six
other

standing
behind
him
four
men
two
women
quinton
takes
one
of
the
books
from
giles
and
looks
at
it
you
wouldn't
want

anything
dangerous
turn
the
wrong
person
into
a
badger
travers
smiles

the
book
back
quinton
i
didn't
realize
you
were
here
giles
gives
book
to
customer

while
i
see
you've
uh
brought
some
of
our
colleagues
with
you
would
you
care
to
introduce
us
well
first
i
thought
we
might
catch
up
the
other
watchers
begin
to
spread
out
through
the
store
well
certainly
certainly
uh
well
um
this
is
the
shop
obviously
giles
begins
walking
toward
the
counter
travers
follows
uh
iit's
been
a
very
interesting
transition
into
the
world
of
retail
but
i
think
it's
gone
rather
well
i'll
give
you
the
grand
tour
if
you
like
no
that's
all
right
i
think

up
to
them
behind
the
counter

i
uh

nigel
comes
up
behind

looking
at
the
racks
of
magic
stuff
behind
the
counter
anya
looks
at
him
suspiciously
buffy
and
i
have
been
training
a
great
deal
these
days
uh
there's
a
a
back
room
giles
points
toward
the
back
travers
sits
on
a
chair
beside
the
counter
oh
yes
i
thought

you
were
keeping
that
space
for
the
really
dangerous
items
that
should
be
kept
out
of
the
public's
hands
travers
giles
frowns
or
maybe
you
don't
worry
about
that
i'm
very
careful
nigel
comes
over
holding
a
vial
most
of
this
stuff
couldn't

also
this
statue
watcher

picks
up
a
statue

a
criminal
offense
watcher
2
giles
looks
surprised
watcher
2
carries
the
statue
over
to
travers
and
when

it

the
power
to
melt
human
eyeballs
watcher

she
gives

and
walks
off

anya
miss
excuse

you
uh
you

anya
stops

back
looking
apprehensive
yes

southeastern
indiana
where
i
was
raised
by
both
a
mother
and
a
father
anya

about
this
review
no
one

anything
to
me
about

let's
sit
down
and
talk
about
it
over
here
all
the
watchers
move
toward
the
round
table
at
the
far
end
of
the
store
watcher
4
female
pours
some
tea
the
others
stand
around
you
all
stand
around
and
look
somber
giles
they
do
giles
rolls
his
eyes
good
job
you
used
to
respect
us
giles
you
used
to
be
one
of
us
you
used
to
pay
me
if
you
recall
firing
me
was
not
my
idea
touche
travers
sits
at
table
but
you
were
on
the
inside
once
you
know
what
sort
of
resources
we
command
another
watcher
puts
a
suitcase
on
the
table
opens
it
takes
out
some
papers
and
puts
them
in
front
of
travers
watcher
4
gives
travers
a
cup
of
tea
we've
discovered
information
about
this
creature
your
glory
some
of
it
is
clearly
vital
the
rest
merely
extremely
disturbing
and
it
won't
be
handed
over
until
we're
convinced
that
you
and
your
slayer
are
prepared
for
it
thus
the
review
giles
leans
over
to
put
hands
on
table
speaks
softly
i'm
not
having
you
put
her
through
another
one
of
your
insane
tests
it's
not
a
test
it's
a
check
of
her
methods
we
need
to
know
that
this
information
is
safe
you
can
trust
her
giles
straightens
up
buffy's
come
very
far
recently
she's
acquired
a
remarkable
focus
cut
to
uc
sunnydale
classroom
buffy
is
sitting
among
the
students
yawning
while
the
professor
lectures
now
rasputin
was
associated
with
a
certain
obscure
religious
sect
professor
buffy
taps
her
pencil
on
her
desk
the
girl
next
to
her
glares
buffy
sees
her
and
stops
tapping
the
pencil
but
continues
fidgeting
they
held
the
tenet
that
in
order
to
be
forgiven
one
first
had
to
sin
rasputin
embraced
this
doctrine
and
proceeded
to
sin
impressively
and
repeatedly
the
notion
that
he
was
in
fact
evil
gained
strength
years
later
professor
buffy
fiddles
with
her
pencil
drops
it
shrugs
and
doesn't
pick
it
up
when
the
conspirators
who
set
out
to
kill
him
found
it
nearly
impossible
to
do
so
buffy
to
herself
nearly
impossible
i'm
sorry
there's
a
question
the
students
look
at
buffy
professor
sighing
miss
summers
of
course
buffy
makes
a
pained
face
stands
up
as
the
professor
gives
her
a
disapproving
look
i
uh
about
you
know
killing
him
you
know
they
they
poisoned
him
and
and
they
beat
him
and
they
shot
him
and
he
didn't
die
until
they
rolled
his
body
in
a
carpet
and
drowned
him
in
a
canal
but
there
are
reported
sightings
of
him
as
late
as
the
1930s
aren't
there
i
can
assure
you
there
is
near
consensus
in
the
academic
community
regarding
the
death
of
rasputin
there
was
also
near
consensus
about
columbus
you
know
until
someone
asked
the
vikings
what
they
were
up
to
in
the
1400s
and
they're
like
'discovering
this
americashaped
continent'
buffy
professor
looks
annoyed
i
just
i'm
only
saying
you
know
it
might
be
interesting
if
we
came
at
it
from
you
know
a
different
perspective
that's
all
well
i'm
sorry
if
you
find
these
facts
so
boring
miss
summers
maybe
you'd
prefer
i
step
aside
so
that
you
can
teach
your
own
course
speculation
101
perhaps
professor
the
other
students
laugh
intro
to
flights
of
fancy
professor
the
students
laugh
more
i
only
meant
what
was
it
you
were
going
on
about
last
week
mysterious
sleeping
patterns
of
the
prussian
generals
professor
buffy
looks
annoyed
now
some
of
us
are
here
to
learn
believe
it
or
not
we're
interested
in
finding
out
what
actually
happened
it's
called
studying
history
you
can
sit
down
now
unless
you
have
something
else
to
add
professor
buffy
scowls
sits
miss
summers
cut
to
graveyard
night
buffy
is
fighting
a
vampire
she
kicks
him
backward
some
of
us
are
here
to
learn
professor
she
kicks
punches
twice
the
vamp
swings
she
ducks
she
grabs
him
and
spins
him
around
throws
him
against
a
headstone
maybe
you'd
like
to
teach
your
own
class
who
are
you
talking
to
buffy
approaches
and
the
vamp
punches
her
in
the
face
she
spins
around
from
the
blow
gets
her
bearings
and
turns
to
attack
again
spike
comes
flying
over
the
headstone
and
grabs
the
vamp
from
behind
knocking
him
to
the
ground
as
he
gets
up
spike
kicks
him
then
stakes
him
spike
grins
at
buffy
who
stalks
forward
spike
why
did
you
do
that
not
for
money
if
that's
what
you're
thinking
your
heartfelt
gratitude's
plenty
spike
stops
grinning
i
expect
i'll
be
getting
that
any
moment
gratitude
for
getting
in
my
way
gegetting
in
your
way
i
saved
you
i
was
regrouping
you
were
about
to
be
regrouped
into
separate

buffy
deeply

a
gesture
with
his
hand

up
sagging
breasts
you
know
what
spike
the
more
i
get
to
know
you
the
more
i
wish

just
don't
hold
their
interest
he
walks
off
leaving
buffy
looking
stung
cut
to
interior
hospital
ben
comes
around
a
corner
wearing
scrubs
but
putting
on
his
jacket
jinx
comes
out
of
a
doorway
and
grabs
him
begging
permission
to
speak
with
you
sir
he
pulls
ben
into
an
empty
room
don't
touch
me
you're
crusty
what
do
you
want
oh
not
me
the
magnificent
glory
she
wants
she
wants
more
information
on
the
slayer
she
knows
you
know
her
the
slayer
i
don't
know
any
slayer
get
away
from
me
you
shouldn't
be
here
oh
i
believe
you
do
sir
she's
short
symmetrical
hair
on
top
buffy
something
buffy
summers
is
the
slayer
that's
the
one
very
clever
of
you
sir
the
slayer
how
does
glory
know
this
i
do
not
know
i
was
not
there
but
the
beauteous
glory
said
for
you
to
tell
us
please
where
her
dwelling
is
who
her
friends
are
why
so
glory
can
find
her
do
something
to
her
why
would
i
do
that
i
don't
know
sir
she
just
said
to
tell
you
to
do
it
for
her
that
was
her
message
well
i've
got
a
message
for
glory
too
cut
to
interior
magic
shop
giles
is
walking
out
of
the
back
room
along
with
the
other
watchers
we've
been
developing
sort
of
a
a
hybrid
fighting
style
let
me
outline
her
progress
for
you
and
ii
think
you'll
see
that
your
review
isn't
strictly
needed
buffy
enters
sees
the
watchers
and
tries
to
back
out
buffy
muttering
bad
day
bad
baaad
miss
summers

travers
buffy
stops
backing
away
good
to
see
you
again
buffy
enters
reluctantly
closes
the
door
behind
her
mr
travers
giles
has
just
been
telling
us
of
your
training
regimen
perhaps
you'll
favor
us
with
a
demonstration
while
we're
here
right
now
no
need
to
rush
you
giles
ruefully
they're
staying
a
little
longer
than
i'd
anticipated
we've
already
laid
out
our
project
for
mr
giles
nigel
the
watchers
and
buffy
move
toward
one
side
of
the
room
while
giles
stays
leaning
against
the
counter
it's
an
exhaustive
examination
of
your
procedures
and
abilities
we'll
observe
your
training
talk
to
your
friends
talk
to
my
friends
yes
we
understand
you're
still
taking
civilians
out
on
patrols
oh
you've
gotta
be
kidding
me
buffy
i
can
sense
your
resistance
and
i
don't
blame
you
but
i
think
your
watcher
hasn't
reminded
you
lately
of
the
resolute
status
of
the
players
in
our
little
game
the
council
fights
evil
the
slayer
is
the
instrument
by
which
we
fight
the
council
remains
the
slayers
change
it's
been
that
way
from
the
beginning
giles
scornfully
well
that's
a
very
comforting
bloodless
way
of
looking
at
it
isn't
it
giles
let
me
talk
to
buffy
because
i
think
she's
understanding
me
travers
to
buffy
glory
is
stronger
than
you
she's
a
more
powerful
instrument
if
you
will
we
can
help
you
we
have
information
that
will
help
pass
the
review
and
we
give
it
to
you
without
reservation
fail
the
review
either
through
incompetence
or
by
resisting
our
recommendations
giles
angrily
moves
toward
them
resisting
your
recommendations
she
fails
if
we
don't
do
whatever
you
say
how
much
under
your
thumb
do
you
think
we
are
how
much
do
you
want
our
help
giles
pokes
his
finger
angrily
at
travers
the
other
watchers
restrain
him
she's
not
your
bloody
instrument
and
you
have
no
right
to
do
any
of
this
giles
giles
shakes
off
the
other
watchers
and
moves
away
frustrated
i
understand
you
think
this
is
unfair
but
there
are
factors
which
should
motivate
you
to
go
along
with
the
review
now
i
don't
want
to
do
this
but
obviously
we
could
shut
this
place
down
permanently
you
can't
do
that
you
don't
have
that
kind
of
power
of
course
we
do
and
a
great
deal
more
in
fact
if
you
insist
on
fighting
us
we'll
arrange
to
have
mr
giles
deported
within
the
day
never
set
foot
in
this
country
again
now
perhaps
you're
used
to
idle
threats
and
sloppy
discipline
miss
summers
but
you're
dealing
with
grownups
now
travers
pause
am
i
making
myself
clear
buffy
looks
angrily
from
travers
to
giles
who
doesn't
look
at
her
and
then
back
she
glares
at
travers
blackout
act
ii

glory's
apartment
jinx
enters
holding
his
head
down
to
hide
his
face
jinx
hey
what's
the
deal
with
your
face
jinx
lifts
his
head
to
reveal
his
face
bruised
and
bloody
we
see
glory
standing
in
front
of
a
vanity
with
a
towel
wrapped
around
her
it's
a
message
from
ben
he
isn't
going
to
help
glory
pouring
oil
into
her
hand
isn't
go
glory
bemused
isn't
going
to
help
no
all
he
has
to
do
is
turn
over
that
tiny
squirming
slayer
girl
glory
rubbing
oil
on
her
arms
i
have
business
to
do
with
her
if
she
knows
where
i
can
start
looking
for
my
key
aah
she
grabs
her
head
in
frustration
jinx
watches
glory
calms
down
and
begins
walking
toward
him
why
won't
he
help
he
knows
her
he
could
go
to
her
he
could
talk
to
her

glory
irritated
he
could
seduce
her
and
bang
the
key
out
of
her
he
is
quite
attractive
well
of
course
he's
attractive
glory
pouty
but
he
drives
me
insane
know
what
i
mean
he
drives
you
insane
yeah
that's
it
exactly
glory
puts
her
head
on
jinx's
chest
oh
sweet
lumpy
minion
you're
the
only
one
that
understands
glory
thoughtfully
probably
cause
i
haven't
sucked
your
brain
out
yet
glory
jinx
cringes
he
makes
me
so
mad
if
i
could
just
get
my
hands
on
him
she
curves
her
fingers
into
claws
and
gestures
as
if
she's
about
to
grab
jinx's
head
he
cringes
in
fear
glory
drops
her
hands
you
know
glory
walks
away
jinx
sighs
in
relief
i'll
just
find
her
myself
cut
to
magic
shop
buffy
and
giles
are
alone
buffy
sits
at
the
round
table
giles
paces
it's
a
power
play
that's
what
it
is
it's
about
who
has
the
power
i'm
guessing
they
do
big
power
outage
in
buffy
county
i
should
have
set
you
loose
on
them
that's
what
i
should
have
done
giles
that
travers
guy
is
like
sixty
i
can't
hit
him
buffy
looks
up
can
i
i
suppose
not
well
i
could
i
think
i
will
can
they
really
do
the
stuff
they
threatened
kick
you
out
the
country
in
a
heartbeat
giles
takes
off
his
glasses
takes
out
a
handkerchief
and
begins
cleaning
his
glasses
see
the
rough
stuff
they're
all
right
out
there
a
bit
hamhanded
but
they
get
it
done
but
uh
this
stuff
the
uh
bureaucracy
the
pulling
of
political
strings
they're
the
best
in
the
world
they
can
kill
you
with
the
stroke
of
a
pen
poncy
sods
there's
a
crunching
noise
as
giles's
glasses
break
in
his
hands
from
too
vigorous
a
cleaning
one
of
the
lenses
has
popped
out
of
the
frame
giles
looks
down
at
them
buffy
softly
am
i
gonna
be
able
to
get
through
this
review
well
i
giles
comes
over
and
sits
next
to
her
i
suppose
they'll
make
it
as
difficult
as
they
want
to
the
physical
stuff
could
be
a
bit
of
a
challenge
giles
puts
on
his
glasses
immediately
takes
them
off
again
that's
not
what
i'm
worried
about
it's
the
other
stuff
examining
decisions
i've
made
i
mean
twice
now
i've
been
within
slaying
distance
of
glory
and
twice
she's
kicked
my
ass
without
even
tensing
a
muscle
and
i
haven't
been
able
to
figure
out
what
she
is
or
anything
about
her
except
that
she
wants
the
key
which
i
have
and
i
can't
even
figure
out
if
it's
okay
for
me
to
tell
anyone
that
buffy
no
one
could
have
done
any
better
than
you
but
no
one
else
is
gonna
be
asked
the
questions
that
i
can't
answer
buffy
getting
agitated
they're
gonna
expect
me
to
to
be
like
a
slayer
and
and
know
stuff
but
i'm
just
me
and
i
don't
know
anything
and
they're
gonna
go
away
and
they're
not
gonna
tell
me
how
to
fight
glory
and
i'm
not
gonna
be
able
to
protect
dawn
buffy
calm
down
the
scandal
here
is
not
anything
you've
done
wrong
it's
the
way
they're
behaving
holding
what
they
know
hostage
with
a
gun
pointed
at
my
bleeding
green
card
no
less
giles
sighs
it's
humiliating
also
smart
they
picked
the
perfect
thing
i
can't
lose
you
giles
softly
thank
you
buffy
sighs
i
guess
i
should
be
getting
ready
what
do
you
think
it'll
be
like
i
mean
how
do
you
think
they'll
start
cut
to
anya
sitting
next
to
xander
in
xander's
apartment
anya
christina
emanuella
jenkins
twenty
years
old
born
on
the
fourth
of
july
and
don't
think
there
weren't
jokes
about
that
my
whole
life
mister
'cause
there
were
'who's
our
little
patriot'
they'd
say
when
i
was
younger
and
therefore
smaller
and
shorter
than
i
am
now
we
see
philip
sitting
across
the
table
from
them
and
watcher
4
standing
in
the
background
philip
taking
notes
so
you
spell
it
anya
yes
yes
fine
now
we
can
get
to
the
questions
cut
to
willow
and
tara's
room

sit
on
the
bed
sidebyside
nigel
stands
before
them
with
a
notebook
questions
great
well
we
can
answer
questions
good
i
need
to
know
a
little
bit
more
about
the
slayer
and
about
the
both
of
you
your
relationship
whatever
you
can
tell
me
ooour
relationship

friends

in
love

lovers
willow
puts
hand
on
tara's
knee
we're
lesbian
gaytype
lovers
i
meant
your
relationship
with
the
slayer
both
girls
look
embarrassed
willow
removes
her
hand
from
tara's
knee
um
just
good
friends
cut
back
to
xanderanya
interrogation
best
friends
willow
and
me
and
buffy
the
three
of
us
have
been
together
from
the
beginning
we've
always
gone
on
patrols
and
uh
done
demon
research
with
her
and
everything
have
you
mastered
any
fighting
disciplines
over
the
years
no
so
you
have
no
special
skills
or
powers
or
knowledge
that
you
bring
to
the
mix
neither
of
you
just
enthusiasm
for
killing
the
demons
go
deadness
for
the
demons
i
don't
have
any
powers
but
i
do
help
how
be
specific
last
year
uh
willow
giles
and
me
combined
our
essences
with
buffy
which
isn't
as
weird
as
it
sounds
xander
laughs
nervously
we
merged
and
i
was
the
heart
part
of
a
superbuffy
again
let
me
stress
the
notasweird
thing
i'm
told
it
was
all
very
professional
are
you
saying
that
the
slayer
needs
that
level
of
help
from
you
often
cut
back
to
willowtara
interrogation
no
no
she
doesn't
need
help
she'd
be
fine
without
us
sometimes
she
goes
off
and
does
stuff
without
even
telling
us
not
that
she's
like
a
a
weird
loner
or
anything
i'm
not
sure
we're
saying
this
right
see
here's
the
thing
we
we
can
help
because
we
do
magicks
i'm
working
on
this
ball
of
sunshine
thing
see
i
have
this
theory
it's
very
cool
aand
if
it
works
easier
slaying
for
buffy
not
that
it's
hard
for
her
now
interesting
what
level
are
you
at
level
magical
proficiency
level
oh
uh
high
a
high
level
very
high
one
of
those
top
levels
five
nigel
writes
this
down
as
willow
and
tara
give
each
other
anxious
looks
willow
mouths
'five'
and
tara
shrugs
and
you're
registered
as
practicing
witches
under
the
names
as
you
gave
them
to
me
rregistered
oh
yes
yes
of
course
we're
rrregistered
tara
nodding
cut
back
to
xanderanya
interrogation
do
either
of
you
know
anything
about
the
key
nope
but
it
sounds
demony
to
me
i
don't
hold
with
that
demon
nonsense
anya
picks
up
a
basket
of
muffins
and
holds
it
toward
philip
muffin
i
cooked
them
myself
philip
gestures
to
indicate
'no
thanks'
so
buffy
sometimes
protects
you
from
the
dangerous
elements
of
her
work
yes
she's
saved
my
life
lots
of
times
the
vampires
in
this
town
hate
her
cut
to
spike's
crypt
spike
staring
at
someone
watcher

os
but
we
understand
that
you
help
the
slayer
we
see
that
spike
is
being
interrogated
by
watcher

while
the
other
two
nameless
male
watchers
stand
between
her
and
spike
one
of
the
men
holds
a
cross
the
other
a
crossbow
i
pitch
in
when
she
pays

she
pays
you
she
gives
you
money
money
a
little
nip
of
blood
out
of
some
stray
victim
whatever
blood
well
if
they're
gonna
die
anyway
spike
considers
come
to
think
of
it
though
that's
a
bit
scandalous
isn't
it
personally
i'm
shocked
the
girl's
slipping
you've
noticed
a
decline
in
her
work
oh
yeah
see
the
poor
little
twig
can't
keep
a
man
gets
her
all
down
few
more
disappointments
she'll
be
cryin'
on
my
shoulder
mark
my
words
watcher
2
frowns
is
that
what
you
want
i'd
think
you'd
want
to
kill
her
you've
killed
slayers
before
spike
intrigued
heard
of
me
have
you
he
walks
a
little
closer
the
two
male
watchers
shift
nervously
and
hold
up
their
weapons
watcher

embarrassed
smile
i
wrote
my
thesis
on
you
spike
grins
well

strength
cut
to
the
workout
room
in
the
back
of
the
magic
shop
nigel
is
tying
a
blindfold
around
buffy's
head
giles
and
the
other
watchers
are
standing
around
these
are
the
qualities
that
the
slayer
must
possess
to
do
her
job
what
came
after
agility
if
you
want
her
to
attack
the
dummy
no
no
philip
will
attack
the
dummy
travers
we
see
philip
standing
next
to
the
dummy
wearing
a
karate
robe
the
slayer's
job
is
to
protect
it
do
you
understand
protect
the
dummy
as
if
it
were
precious
now
getting
the
best
of
philip
will
require
agility
listening
to
my
instructions
at
the
same
time
that
will
demonstrate
clarity
and
stamina
and
strength
will
win
the
long
fight
good
luck
instructions
yeah
i'll
be
telling
you
what
to
do
how
to
counter
philip's
attack

you're
familiar

looks
from

to
giles
well
however
you
prepare
the

leave
buffy
and
giles
look
glum
cut
to
buffy
entering
the
summers
home
buffy
puts
down
her
bag
calling
mom
she
walks
toward
the
living
room
as
she
rounds
the
corner
she
comes
facetoface
with
glory
long
day
sweetie
blackout
act
iii

fade
back
in
on
buffy
looking
apprehensively
at
glory
as
glory
checks
out
the
living
room
so
this
is
where
the
slayer
eats
sleeps
and
glory
runs
her
finger
through
the
dust
on
a
side
table
combs
her
hair
oh
glory
picks
up
a
photo
so
cute
glory
holds
it
up
for
buffy
to
see
then
puts
it
down
i
can't
even
stand
it
personally
i
need
more
space
but
uh
this
is
good
for
you
it's
it's
so
quaint
and
as
glory
is
speaking
with
her
back
to
buffy
buffy
moves
across
the
room
to
the
fireplace
and
picks
up
a
poker
when
she
straightens
up
glory
is
right
behind
her
buffy
glory
takes
the
poker
if
i
wanted
to
fight
you
could
tell
by
the
being
dead
already
glory
goes
to
sit
in
an
armchair
giggles
so

nice
little

you
want
the
key
why
else
do
you
think
i'd

think
you
knew
where
it
is

a
good
thing
i'm
glad
you
think

the
only

behind
glory
buffy
looks
at
dawn
in
alarm
tries
not
to
let
glory
see
her
looking
but
to
me
you're
a
bug
you
should
get
down
on
your
knees
and
worship
me
dawn
walks
closer
buffy
widens
her
eyes
to
signal
dawn
to
go
away

glory
dawn
begins
to
back

break
a
nail
but

head
and
snaps
her
fingers
dawn

one
soldier
in

ourselves
with
the
beast
you

be
mad

the
ones
tried
killing
me
no
we
were
fools
three
alone
but
if
it
takes
a
hundred
men
we
send
a
hundred
men
and
if
it
takes
a
thousand
we
send
a
thousand
a
thousand
so
long
as
you
protect
the
key
the
brotherhood
will
never
stop
until
we
destroy
it
and
you

the
knight
looks
surprised
edges
around
her
and
leaves
buffy
stares
at
the
sword
cut
to
buffy
entering
the
magic
shop
still
holding
the
sword
pan
across
all
the
watchers
standing
there
the
four
slayerettes
still
sitting
on
the
upper
level
and
travers
sitting
at
the
table
with
a
pile
of
papers
spread
out
in
front
of
him
giles
sits
on
the
stairs
leading
up
to
the
balcony
you're
late
yeah
giles
sees
the
sword
gets
up
was
was
there
an
attack
yeah
we
can
begin
the
review
at
last
we'll
uh
skip
the
more
obvious
questions
buffy
puts
the
sword
down
on
his
papers
there
isn't
gonna
be
a
review
sorry
no
review
no
interrogation
no
questions
you
know
i
can't
answer
no
hoops
no
jumps

buffy
nigel
starts
to
speak
and
no
interruptions
nigel
shuts
up
buffy
looks
around
begins
to
pace
see
i've
had
a
lot
of
people
talking
at
me
the
last
few
days
everyone
just
lining
up
to
tell
me
how
unimportant
i
am
and
i've
finally
figured
out
why
buffy
looks
travers
in
the
eye
power
i
have
it
they
don't
this
bothers
them
buffy
moves
back
to
the
table
removing
her
coat

to
my
home
today
giles
alarmed
buffy
are

buffy
puts
her
coat
on
a
chair
just
to
talk
buffy
resumes
pacing
she
told
me
i'm
a
bug
i'm
a
flea
she
could
squash
me
in
a
second
buffy
stops
looks
at
travers
again
only
she
didn't
she
came
into
my
home
and
we
talked
we
had
what
in
her
warped
brain
probably
passes
for
a
civilized
conversation
why
buffy
pauses
because
she
needs
something
from
me
because
i
have
power
over
her
buffy
looks
around
hands
on
her
hips
she
walks
the
floor
looking
from
one
watcher
to
the
next
as
she
talks
you

come
all
the
way
from
england

determine
whether

you
came
to
beg
me
to
let
you
back
in
to
give
your
jobs
your
lives
some
semblance
of
meaning
this
is
beyond
insolence
buffy
grabs
the
sword
from
the
table
and
throws
it
across
the
room
in
a
single
movement
it
flies
pointfirst
into
the
wall
directly
in
front
of
nigel's
nose
he
jumps
back
looking
shocked
buffy
clears
throat
i'm
fairly
certain

interruptions
xander
whispers
