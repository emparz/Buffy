pieces
of

looks
up

barrel
of
a

inches
from
jonathan's
head
suddenly
water
squirts
out
of
it
and
all
over
jonathan's
face
he
wakes
up
and
jumps
up
with
a
gasp
andrew

andrew
grins
and
nods
he
turns
and
picks
up
a
very
long
wooden
tube
about
three
inches
in
diameter
painted
with
various
abstract
designs
he
sits
back
in
his
chair
puts
his
mouth
to
one
end
of
the
tube
and
blows
it
makes
a
low
sound
like
a
flugelhorn
cut
to
outside
buffy
walking
around
the
building
hears
the
horn
sound
she
continues
walking
she
rounds
a
corner
and
finds
an
alley
dark
containing
a
pickup
truck
and
a
car
buffy
walks
into
the
alley
looking
from
her
piece
of
paper
to
the
house
and
back
something
drops
from
the
roof
of
the
nerds'
house
and
lands
behind
buffy
she
turns
to
look
at
it
oh
hi
it's
an
ugly
demon
with
waxy
skin
and
weird
marblelike
eyes
it
growls
and
advances
you
didn't
by
chance
happen
to
just
eat
a
couple
of
nerds
did
you
the
demon
takes
a
swing
at
her
and
she
leans
back
to
avoid
it
it
swings
again
and
then
tries
a
roundhouse
kick
which
buffy
ducks
underneath
she
blocks
a
punch
and
punches
it
in
the
stomach
then
kicks
it
back
the
demon
hits
her
and
she
goes
down
it
grabs
her
and
throws
her
against
the
car
she
lands
on
the
hood
sits
up
and
kicks
the
demon
with
both
feet
as
it
reels
back
she
stands
up
on
the
hood
the
demon
goes
to
punch
her
and
she
leaps
up
onto
the
car's
roof
the
demon
punches
the
hood
where
she
just
was
it
tries
to
hit
her
legs
but
she
jumps
up
crouches
on
the
hood
and
kicks
the
demon
again
she
does
a
flip
off
the
car
onto
the
ground
while
kicking
the
demon
again
and
it
goes
down
buffy
picks
up
a
metal
garbage
can
and
slams
it
down
onto
the
demon
it
gets
up
as
she
raises
the
can
for
another
blow
the
demon
shoves
the
garbage
can
out
of
buffy's
hands
then
hits
her
in
the
face
she
spins
around
and
ends
up
with
her
face
pressed
against
the
car
window
the
demon
grabs
her
from
behind
she
spins
around
again
and
hits
it
it
reels
backward
they
trade
kicks
and
the
demon's
head
goes
through
the
car
window
breaking
it
close
shot
on
the
demon's
hand
pressed
against
the
car
door
a
long
thin
bony
spike
suddenly
shoots
out
of
its
knuckle
the
demon
struggles
with
its
head
and
shoulders
still
inside
the
car
buffy
grabs
it
and
it
elbows
her
off
turns
around
grabs
her
and
holds
her
tightly
against
its
body
the
demon
raises
its
hand
with
the
spike
still
sticking
out
of
it
buffy
sees
the
spike
for
the
first
time
and
looks
alarmed
the
demon
stabs
the
spike
into
her
shoulder

buffy
is
in
the
corner
between

walls
wearing
a
plain

screaming
and
struggling
as
two
men
try
to
hold
her
down
one
man
is
injecting
something
into

from

kitchen
holding
a
glass
of
water
buffy
os
i've
been
having
these
flashes

i
guess
willow
comes
into
the
living
room
where
buffy
is
sitting
in
the
armchair
willow
gives
buffy
the
water
since
when
uh
night
before
last
willow
sits
on
the
sofa
where
xander
and
dawn
are
already
sitting
looking
at
buffy
i
was
uh
checking
houses
on
that
list
you
gave
me
and
looking
for
warren
and
his
pals
and
then
bam
some
kind
of
gross
waxy
demonthing
poked
me
and
when
you
say
poke
buffy
rolling
her
eyes
in
the
arm
buffy
xander
and
willow
exchanging
a
look
it
stung
me
or
something
and
then
i
was
like
no
it
it
wasn't
like
i
was
in
an
institution
there
were
um
doctors
and
nurses
and
and
other
patients
they
they
told
me
that
i
was
sick
i
guess
crazy
and
that
um
sunnydale
and
and
all
of
this
it
none
of
it
was
real
oh
come
on
that's
ridiculous
what
you
think
this
isn't
real
just
because
of
all
the
vampires
and
demons
and
exvengeance
demons
and
the
sister
that
used
to
be
a
big
ball
of
universedestroying
energy
xander

felt
so
real
buffy

together

buffy
distantly
like

separated
from

with
her
knees
drawn
up
again
are
you
saying
that
buffy
could
be
like
she
was
before
any
of
this
happened
doctor
gets
up
comes
around
the
desk
mrs
summers
you
have
to
understand
the
severity
of
what's
happened
to
your
daughter
doctor
sits
on
the
edge
of
his
desk
for
the
last
six
years
she's
been
in
an
undifferentiated
type
of
schizophrenia
we
know
what
her
condition
is
hank
buffy
frowning
that's
not
what
we're
asking
buffy's
delusions
are
multilayered
doctor
joyce
and
hank
listening
intently
she
believes
she's
some
type
of
hero
the
slayer
the
slayer
right
but
that's
only
one
level
she's
also
created
an
intricate
latticework
to
support
her
primary
delusion
in
her
mind
she's
the
central
figure
in
a
fantastic
world
beyond
imagination
doctor
buffy
staring
into
the
distance
frowning
she's
surrounded
herself
with
friends
most
with
their
own
superpowers
who
are
as
real
to
her
as
you
or
me
more
so
unfortunately
together
they
face
grand
overblown
conflicts
against
an
assortment
of
monsters
both
imaginary
and
rooted
in
actual
myth
every
time
we
think
we're
getting
through
to
her
more
fanciful
enemies
magically
appear
buffy
doctor
suddenly
realizing
how
did
i
miss
doctor
and
she's
buffy
warren
and
jonathan
they
did
this
to
me
buffy
becomes
agitated
tries
to
get
up
out
of
her
chair
the
doctor
reaches
over
to
stop
her
buffy
it's
all
right
they
can't
hurt
you
here
you're
with
your
family
buffy
looks
around
upset
buffy
tearful
dawn
hank
to
doctor
that's
the
sister
right
a
magical
key
buffy
inserted
dawn
into
her
delusion
actually
rewriting
the
entire
history
of
it
to
accommodate
a
need
for
a
familial
bond
doctor
to
buffy
buffy
but
that
created
inconsistencies
didn't
it
doctor
buffy
staring
at
him
your
sister
your
friends
all
of
those
people
you
created
in
sunnydale
they
aren't
as
comforting
as
they
once
were
are
they
they're
coming
apart
buffy
whimpers
lowers
her
head
again
buffy
listen
to
what
the
doctor's
saying
it's
important
buffy
you
used
to
create
these
grand
villains
to
battle
against
and
now
what
is
it
just
ordinary
students
you
went
to
high
school
with
doctor
buffy
staring
at
him
no
gods
or
monsters
just
three
pathetic
little
men
who
like
playing
with
toys
buffy

around
jonathan's
shoulders
sighs
it's
just
not

warren
slaps
jonathan
on
the
shoulder
in
friendly
fashion
and
returns
to
his
seat
andrew
looks
relieved
jonathan
does
not
look
reassured
cut
to
the
summers
house
buffy
sits
on
the
sofa
staring
at
a
photo
of
joyce
hank
and
young
buffy
from
episode
the
weight
of
the
world
they
are
all
smiling
and
happy
together
willow
enters
holding
a
piece
of
paper
willow
smiling
look
buffy
i
found
the
demon
fits
your
description
and
symptoms
perfectly
willow
sits
next
to
buffy
and
holds
out
the
paper
buffy
puts
down
the
photo
still
looking
pensive
look
is
this
it
close
shot
on
the
paper
with
a
picture
of
the
demon
buffy
looks
at
it
nods
without
saying
anything
willow
smiling
see
it's
gonna
be
okay
its
pokey
stinger
carries
an
antidote
to
its
own
poison
willow
stops
smiling
as
she
sees
that
buffy
isn't
cheered
buffy
resumes
looking
at
the
photo
buffy
very
quietly
i
feel
so
lost
i
know
you're
confused
it's
it's
that
crazy
juice
inside
you
it's
more
than
that
buffy
willow
frowning
even
before
the
demon
i've
been
so
detached
we've
all
been
kind
of
slumming
every
day
i
try
to
snap
out
of
it
figure
out
why
i'm
like
that
buffy
look
at
me
buffy
looks
at
willow
her
lips
quivering
like
she's
about
to
cry
you
are
not
in
an
institution
you
have
never
been
in
an
institution
buffy
whispers
yes
i
have
what
buffy
sighs
back
when
i
saw
my
first
vampires
buffy
shot
of
the
photo
i
got
so
scared
i
told
my
parents
and
they
completely
freaked
out
they
thought
there
was
something
seriously
wrong
with
me
so
they
sent
me
to
a
clinic
willow
shocked
you
never
said
anything
buffy
tearful
i
was
only
there
a
couple
of
weeks
i
stopped
talking
about
it
and
they
let
me
go
eventually
my
parents
just
forgot
god
that's
horrible
buffy
crying
what
if
i'm
still
there
what
if
i
never
left
that
clinic

xander
and
spike
walking
through
the
forest
together
xander
holds
a
flashlight
so
she's
having
the
wiggins
is
she
thinks
none
of
us
are
real
bloody
selfcentered
if
you
ask
me
spike
we
need
muscle
not
color
commentary
on
the
other
hand
it
might
explain
some
things
this
all
being
in
that
twisted
brain
of
hers
yeah
thinks
up
some
chip
in
my
head
make
me
soft
fall
in
love
with
her
then
turn
me
into
her
soddin'
sex
slave
xander

nothing
alternative

we're
all
little
figments

in
a
different
reality

might
not
have
left
your
bride
at
the
altar
you
might
have
gone
through
with
it
like
a
man
xander
annoyed
okay
one
more
syllable
about
anya
the
demon
leaps
out
at
them
growling
xander

a
metallic
clanking
noise
as
the
rifle
hits
the
demon's
hand
which
is
wearing
some
sort
of
gauntlet
the
demon
shoves
xander
onto
the
ground

exchanges
a

more
punches
with
the
demon
as
xander
picks
up

rid
you

nasty
martyrdom
spike
buffy
still
not
looking

him
see
i
figured
it
out
luv
you
can't
help
yourself
you're
not
drawn
to
the
dark
like
i
thought
buffy
looks
up
at
him
now
still
frowning
you're
addicted
to
the
misery
it's
why
you
won't
tell
your
pals
about
us
might
actually
have
to
be
happy
if
you
did
they'd
either
understand
and
help
you
god
forbid
or
drive
you
out
where
you
can
finally
be
at
peace
in
the
dark
with
me
either
way
you'd
be
better
off
for
it
but
you're
too
twisted
for
that
spike
pauses
let
yourself
live
already
and
stop
with
the
bloody
hero
trip
for
a
sec
we'd
all
be
the
better
for
it
buffy
frowns
even
more
looks
up
at
spike
again
you
either
tell
your
friends
about
us
or
i
will
he
turns
and
leaves
buffy
makes
an
anguished
face
holds
the

have
to

have
to
start
ridding
your
mind
of
those
things
that
support
your
hallucinations
doctor
buffy
looking
up
at
him
you
understand
there
are
things
in
that
world
that
you
cling
to
for
your
delusion

safeholds
but
for
your
mind
they're
traps
we
have
to
break
those
down
buffy
softly
slaying
yes
but
i'm
talking
about
those
things
you
want
there
what
keeps
you
going

momentary
awakening

was
them
that
pulled
you
back
in

not
really
your
friends

they're
just
tricks
keeping
you
from
getting
healthy

have
to
do

it
takes
to
convince
