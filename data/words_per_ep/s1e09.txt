the
camera
eventually

morgan
and
his
dummy
sid
morgan
rubs
his
temples
a
moment
and
then
looks
around
cut
to
the
stage
cordelia
is
singing
the
greatest
love
of
all
offkey
learning
to

there
never
to
walk
in
anyone's

be
lovely
but
i
didn't
do
the
part
with
the
sparklers
um
wwe'll
um
save
that
for
the
dress
rehearsal
giles
anxious
to
get
rid
of
her
uh
lisa
please
uhhh
she
puts
the
microphone
back
on
its
stand
and
leaves
the
stage
as
lisa
sets
up
with
her
tuba
cut
back
to
giles
as
lisa
begins
her
solo
he
rubs
his
eyes
buffy
willow
and
xander
come
down
the
center
aisle
buffy
draws
a
breath
if
it
isn't
the
great
producer
they
go
into
the
seats
and
sit
around
giles
had
to
see
this
to
believe
it
oh
you
three
the
school
talent
show
how
ever
did
you
finagle
such
a
primo
assignment
our
new
f√£hrer
mr
snyder
i
think
they
call
'em
'principals'
now
mm
he
thought
it
would
behoove
me
to
have
more
contact
with
the
students
i
did
try
to
explain
that
my
vocational
choice
of
librarian
was
a
deliberate
attempt
to
giles
draws
a
breath
minimize
said
contact
but
uh
he
would
have
none
of
it
giles
unto
every
generation
is
born
one
who
must
run
the
annual
talentless
show
you
cannot
escape
your
destiny
if
you
had
any
shred
of
decency
you
would
have
participated
or
at
least
um
helped
nah
i
think
i'll
take
on
your
traditional
role
and
watch
and
mock
and
laugh
they
all
laugh
okay
i
think
maybe
we
better
leave
our
mr
giles
to
this
business
he
calls
a
show
the
three
of
them
get
up
and
start
back
up
the
aisle
principal
snyder
is
waiting
there
for
them
principal
snyder
so
we
think
school
events
are
stupid
and
we
think
authority
figures
are
to
be
made
fun
of
no
no
we
don't
wunless
you
do
and
we
think
our
afternoon
classes
are
optional
all
three
of
you
left
campus
yesterday
yeah
but
we
were
fighting
a
demon
fighting
not
fighting
no
we
uh
left
to
avoid
fighting
real
antisocial
types
you
need
to
integrate
into
this
school
people
snyder
crosses
his
arms
i
think
i
just
found
three
eager
new
participants
for
the
talent
show
what
no
please
i've
been
watching
you
three
always
getting
into
one
scrape
or
another
well
we're
really
really
sorry
but
about
the
talent
show
pleeease
you
can't
make
us
snyder
interrupts
my
predecessor
mr
flutie
may
have
gone
in
for
all
that
touchyfeely
relating
nonsense
but
he
was
eaten
you're
in
my
world
now
and
sunnydale
has
touched
and
felt
for
the
last
time
he
starts
past
them
down
toward
the
stage
can
i
just
mention
that
detention
is
a
timehonored
form
of
punishment
buffy
nods
vigorously
in
agreement
i
know
the
three
of
you
will
come
up
with
a
wonderful
act
for
the
school
to
watch
and
mock
and
laugh
at
he
continues
down
to
the
stage
xander
can't
believe
this
he
points
up
with
both
index
fingers
and
sits
down
in
a
seat
no
buffy
spaces
out
and
moans
she
goes
back
into
giles'
row
sits
next
to
him
and
looks
to
him
for
sympathy
he
has
none
to
give
and
tries
to
hide
a
smirk
the
tuba
solo
is
over
willow
just
stands
there
with
a
big
frown
on
her
face
giles
to
lisa
thank
you
the
next
act
sets
up
it's
morgan
with
his
dummy
sid
ewww
dummy
xander
sees
a
mime
and
jumps
in
his
seat
dyow

the
wig

since
i
was
little
what

saw

a
story
there
morgan
on
stage
hi

morgan
morgan
moves
the
dummy's
head
and
i'm
sid
he
is
an
awful
ventriloquist
and
giles
winces
buffy
raises
her
eyebrows
and
stares
in
disbelief
morgan
as
sid
hey
morgan
would
you
like
to
tell
some
jokes
morgan
as
himself
would
i
morgan
as
sid
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
it's
also
a
wood
nose
and
a
wood
mouth
willow
can't
believe
his
act
either
morgan
laughs
nervously
for
sid
buffy
looks
at
giles
he
takes
off
his
glasses
morgan
as
sid
i
didn't
sleep
at
all
last
night
alright
time
out
let's
stop
this
before
someone
gets
hurt
sid
to
morgan
kid
you
are
the
worst
even
i
can
see
your
lips
move
buffy
starts
to
giggle
giles
looks
up
again
and
puts
his
glasses
back
on
intrigued
now
that
he
sees
he
may
have
at
least
one
good
act
c'mon
sid
you're
spoiling
my
act
i
worked
on
these
jokes
for
weeks
you
call
those
jokes
my
jockey
shorts
are
made
out
of
better
material
a
few
students
have
gathered
at
the
edge
of
the
stage
to
watch
morgan's
act
and
laugh
and
they're
edible
more
laughs
from
the
students
buffy
willow
and
xander
are
into
it
now
too
there
you
see
i'm
sure
you
three
can
come
up
with
something
equally
exciting
sid
smiles
cut
to
the
girls'
locker
room
emily
is
changing
back
into
her
regular
clothes
she
puts
her
ballet
outfit
and
shoes
into
her
locker
and
closes
it
she
hears
a
noise
is
anybody
there
she
walks
to
the
end
of
the
row
of
lockers
and
peeks
around
the
corner
hello
she
walks
around
to
the
next
row
of
lockers
no
one's
there
the
demon
exhales
as
it
watches
her
from
low
to
the
floor
hello
she
continues
down
the
row
toward
the
showers
the
demon
comes
up
behind
her
emily
turns
and
screams
fade
to
black
i
will
be
flesh
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

the
talent
show
tryouts
i
reach
into
the
hat
and
out
comes
he
lifts
the
hat
and
looks
around
frantically
has
anybody
seen
a
rabbit
he
begins
to
search
along
the
floor
the
camera
follows
elliot
as
he
juggles
and
walks
past
marc
toward
lisa
then
it
follows
her
for
a
few
steps
the
camera
pulls
back
to
xander
willow
and
buffy
practicing
a
dramatic
scene
xander
poses
with
his
right
arm
in
the
air
to
begin
his
line
i
can't
do
this
xander
come
on
i
i
can't
i
have
my
pride
okay
i
don't
have
a
lot
of
my
pride
but
i
have
enough
so
that
i
can't
do
this
he
goes
over
to
the
steps
at
the
side
of
the
stage
to
sit
willow
follows
him
a
dramatic
scene
is
the
easiest
way
to
get
through
the
talent
show
because
it
doesn't
require
an
actual
talent
willow
sits
above
him
but
we
have
talent
we
can
do
stuff
buffy
uh
buffy
also
sitting
now
what
am
i
gonna
do
slay
vampires
on
stage
maybe
in
a
funny
way
willow
you
can
do
stuff
uh
the
piano
you
play
a
little
well
that's
cool
you
can
accompany
us
and
we
can
attempt
to
sing
oh
iin
front
of
other
people
then
no
i
don't
play
whatever
happened
to
corporal
punishment
sid
whistles
at
the
girls
xander
buffy
and
willow
look
at
him
and
morgan
mm
mm
mm
look
at
the
goodies
morgan
looks
embarrassed
willow
gets
up
and
goes
over
to
him
morgan
you're
really
getting
good
where
did
you
come
up
with
that
voice
it's
kind
of
an
imitation
of
my
dad
sounds
real
it
is
real
i'm
the
one
with
the
talent
here
the
kid's
dead
weight
sid
to
willow
how
about
you
and
i
do
a
little
rehearsin'
on
our
own
honey
uh
hey
you
know
what
they
say
once
you
go
wood
nothin's
as
good
okay
morgan
we
get
the
joke
horny
dummy
ha
ha
it's
very
funny
but
you
might
wanna
consider
getting
some
new
shtick
unless
you
want
your
prop
ending
up
as
a
duraflame
log
morgan
and
sid
exchange
a
look
cut
to
a
view
of
the
seats
from
above
principal
snyder
and
giles
come
in
through
the
doors
at
the
back
of
the
auditorium
the
camera
slowly
pans
down
to
them
as
they
walk
down
the
aisle
kids
today
need
discipline
that's
an
unpopular
word
these
days
'discipline'
i
know
principal
flutie
would
have
said
'kids
need
understanding
kids
are
human
beings'
that's
the
kind
of
woollyheaded
liberal
thinking
that
leads
to
being
eaten
i
i
think
perhaps
it
was
a
little
more
complex
than
um
this
place
has
quite
a
reputation
suicide
missing
persons
spontaneous
cheerleader
combustion
you
can't
put
up
with
that
you've
gotta
keep
an
eye
on
the
bad
element
they
reach
the
stage
and
stop
the
camera
has
closed
in
on
them
snyder
nods
up
towards
the
stage
like
those
three
cut
to
buffy
willow
and
xander
practicing
their
dramatic
scene
cut
to
snyder
kids
i
don't
like
them
from
now
on
you're
gonna
see
a
very
different
sunnydale
high
tight
ship
clean
orderly
snyder
faces
giles
and
quiet
cut
to
the
girls'
locker
room
a
girl
screams
loudly
when
she
discovers
emily's
body
cut
to
later
as
the
paramedics
prepare
the
body
for
transport
giles
comes
out
of
the
locker
room
into
the
hall
he
ducks
under
the
yellow
police
tape
and
goes
over
to
the
team
giles
clears
his
throat
it
was
emily
emily
dancer
emily
oh
man
i
hate
this
school
uh
it
must
have
happened
just
after
uh
dress
rehearsals
there
was
a
crosscountry
meet
at
melville
she
she
she
never
showed
up
for
it
vampire
um
i
think
not
giles
share
what
happened
giles
exhales
her
heart
was
removed
yikes
does
that
mean
anything
to
you
besides
buffy
shudders
ooooooo
uh
giles
exhales
there
are
various
demons
which
which
feed
off
human
hearts
but
they
look
back
and
see
the
knife
being
put
into
an
evidence
bag
but
demons
have
claws
and
teeth
they
got
no
use
for
a
big
old
knife
which
more
than
likely
makes
our
murderer
human
did
i
mention
that
i
hate
this
school
so
emily
was
killed
by
a
regular
human
person
the
evidence
certainly
points
that
way
no
wait
ii'm
not
buying
you
guys
remember
the
hellmouth
mystical
activity
is
totally
rife
here
this
to
me
says
demon
i'd
like
to
think
you're
right
a
demon
is
a
creature
of
evil
pure
and
very
simple
a
person
driven
to
kill
is
is
um
it's
more
complex
the
creep
factor
is
also
heightened
it
could
be
anyone
it
could
be
me
willow
gets
looks
from
them
all
it's
not
though
uh
demon
or
no
we
have
some
investigating
to
do
i
suggest
we
start
with
your
your
talent
show
compatriots
one
of
them
may
have
been
the
last
to
see
her
alive
cut
to
the
band
room
buffy
is
interviewing
lisa
i
didn't
know
her
too
well
there's
that
whole
dancerband
rivalry
y'know
i've
heard
about
that
but
i
did
speak
to
her
a
little
the
day
that
yesterday
how
did
she
seem
cut
to
outside
where
giles
is
interviewing
marc
as
he
shuffles
a
deck
of
cards
she
was
happy
i
guess
she
was
psyched
to
be
doing
the
show
she
was
a
really
good
dancer
here
pick
a
card
uh
um
giles
reaches
for
a
card
no
waiwaiwaiwait
not
that
one
pick
this
one
giles
takes
the
card
do
you
remember
the
last
time
you
saw
her
she
was
talkin'
to
someone
who
cut
to
a
classroom
willow
and
elliot
come
in
that
smart
guy
the
one
with
the
dummy
what's
his
name
morgan
yeah
that's
it
he
was
actin'
kinda
strange
strange
how
cut
outside
to
cheerleader
practice
xander
is
talking
to
cordelia
it's
just
such
a
tragedy
for
me
emma
was
like
my
best
friend
emily
cut
to
the
band
room
well
morgan's
just
strange
he's
always
rubbing
his
head
a
lot
and
moaning
especially
the
other
day
cut
to
outside
he
seemed
kinda
paranoid
lookin'
around
at
everyone
cut
to
the
classroom
and
i
think
i
saw
him
arguing
with
his
dummy
cut
outside
all
i
can
think
is
it
coulda
been
me
we
can
dream
cut
to
the
auditorium
buffy
comes
in
through
the
front
side
door
she
looks
around
and
walks
over
to
the
stage
she
sees
sid
on
a
stool
facing
the
curtain
sid
to
morgan
offstage
right
now
you
and
me
gotta
be
on
the
lookout
figure
out
who's
gonna
be
next
morgan
comes
on
stage
how
are
we
supposed
to
morgan
sees
buffy
oh
hi
hello
i
was
just
working
on
throwing
my
voice
morgan
walks
upstage
uh
morgan
did
you
notice
anything
weird
going
on
around
here
yesterday
morgan
gathers
sid
up
weird
what
d'you
mean
morgan
goes
down
the
steps
from
the
stage
with
emily
did
she
say
anything
to
you
was
she
arguing
with
anyone
morgan
goes
over
to
sid's
case
no
she
was
dancing
morgan
opens
the
case
sid
and
i
were
talking
talking
rehearsing
so
you
didn't
notice
anything
weird
at
he
holds
his
hand
to
his
forehead
in
pain
and
sits
down
ohhh
morgan
are
you
okay
look
sweetheart
he
answered
your
question
now
leave
him
alone
morgan's
pain
has
subsided
and
he
looks
up
at
buffy
okay
morgan
how
'bout
talking
to
me
yourself
now
he
said
all
he's
gonna
say
morgan
looks
nervously
between
buffy
and
sid
he
gets
up
it's
okay
sid
we're
done
morgan
puts
sid
in
his
case
i'm
sorry
look
i
didn't
mean
to
make
you
mad
no
i'm
morgan
quietly
it's
him
morgan
indicates
sid
he's
morgan
closes
the
case
we
have
to
go
morgan
grabs
the
case
and
leaves
buffy
taken
aback
cute
couple
cut
to
the
library
willow
buffy
and
xander
come
in
okay
next
time
we
split
up
someone
else
is
on
cordy
detail
five
more
minutes
with
her
and
we
woulda
had
another
organ
donor
i
think
i
had
a
bit
more
luck
everyone
i
talked
to
seemed
to
point
their
fingers
at
the
same
person
they
all
come
into
giles'
office
morgan
morgan
we
have
a
winner
i
fear
i
was
led
to
the
same
conclusion
well
what
do
we
do
we
don't
slay
him
right
we
wanna
bring
him
to
justice
we
could
set
up
a
complex
sting
operation
where
we
get
him
to
confess
uh
i
should
wear
a
wire
whoa
hey
you
guys
all
we
know
is
that
morgan
is
a
grade
a
large
weirdo
that
doesn't
lead
directly
to
murderer
guy
talks
to
his
puppet
and
for
his
puppet
well
yeah
but
what
about
the
whole
'it's
a
demon'
theory
i'm
looking
into
that
but
uh
my
investigation
is
somewhat
hampered
by
our
life
in
the
theater
uh
priority
check
giles
buffy
weighs
the
two
with
her
hands
talent
show
murder
yeah
we
can't
do
the
talent
show
it's
unthinkable
i'm
not
able
to
think
it
principal
snyder
is
watching
us
all
very
closely
now
if
he
chooses
he
can
make
all
our
lives
extremely
difficult
a
slayer
cannot
afford
that
we
will
find
this
murderer
but
in
the
meantime
the
show
must
go
on
this
is
so
unfair
buffy
you
uh
watch
morgan
check
his
locker
see
if
there's
anything
there
like
a
heart
or
something
alright
i'll
pull
up
his
locker
number
willow
goes
to
the
pc
can
i
still
wear
a
wire
cut
to
the
hall
after
school
buffy
quietly
comes
through
the
doors
from
the
stairwell
looking
around
to
see
if
anyone's
there
she
passes
a
door
it
opens
but
buffy
doesn't
see
it
only
hears
the
sound
cut
to
a
shot
of
her
through
the
door
from
low
to
the
floor
she
twists
around
to
look
behind
her
toward
the
sound
but
doesn't
realize
it
was
the
door
that's
now
ajar
she
goes
back
to
looking
for
morgan's
locker
and
finds
it
she
starts
to
work
the
combination
okay
two
to
the
left
three
to
the
right
she
looks
in
both
directions
again
and
then
slams
her
palm
into
the
lock
when
she
takes
her
hand
away
there's
a
clean
hole
she
reaches
in
with
her
fingers
and
undoes
the
latch
she
looks
around
in
the
locker
and
is
about
to
take
sid's
case
out
when
principal
snyder
grabs
her
hand
from
behind
startling
her
principal
snyder
what

you
doing
uh
looking
for
something
school
hours
are
over
you
therefore

be
gone
and

buffy
laughs
nervously
there

things

will
not
tolerate
students
loitering
on
campus
after
school
horrible
murders
with
hearts
being
removed
and
also
smoking

snyder
suspicious

snyder
buffy
smiles

buffy
looks
into
the
locker
yeah

a
friend

out
of
his
case
she
pulls
the
case
partially
out
of
the
locker
opens
it
and
is
surprised
to
find
it
empty
she
quickly
closes
it
and

at
snyder

buffy
confused
i

sunnydale
high
school
and
my
lovely
assistant
steps
into
the
box
cut
to
the
stage
in
the
auditorium
marc's
assistant
steps
into
the
box
he
closes
the
door
and
turns
it
around
and
behold
he
opens
the
box
but
his
assistant
is
still
there
you
were
supposed

and
laughing
marc
closes
the
door
to
the
box
and
butts
his
head
against
it
giles
comes
out
from
backstage
with
cordelia
close
behind
i
don't
understand
why
i
why
i
have
to
follow
brett
and
his
stupid
band
because
we
have
to
clear
their
equipment
before
the
finale
i
told
you
but
the
mood
it'll
be
all
wrong
cordelia
gets
in
front
of
him
and
stops
him
my
song
is
about
dignity
and
human
feelings
and
personal
hygiene
or
something
anyway
it's
sappy
and
no
one
is
gonna
be
feeling
sappy
after
all
that
rock
and
roll
giles
doesn't
want
to
hear
it
he
gives
cordelia
a
look
like
something's
wrong
uhhh
what
oh
i'm
sorry
um
your
hair
uh
there's
something
wrong
with
my
hair
cordelia
pulls
it
behind
her
ears
giles
remains
silent
but
continues
to
stare
ohmigod
cordelia
quickly
leaves
giles
to
himself
xander
was
right
it
worked
like
a
charm
he
sees
buffy
come
down
the
aisle
and
goes
over
to
her
hello
you
look
a
bit
worse
for
uh
buffy
heads
into
the
seats
to
willow
and
xander
giles
follows
what
exactly
are
you
the
worse
for
where's
morgan
buffy
sits
uh
i
i
haven't
seen
him
did
he
do
something
to
you
no
it
was
his
sid
the
dummy
she
suddenly
has
giles'
full
attention
okay
everyone
look
at
me
like
i'm
in
a
bunny
suit
'cause
that's
how
stupid
i
feel
saying
this
i
think
sid
was
in
my
room
last
night
with
morgan
no
he
was
alone
and
alive
did
you
see
him
well
i
saw
something
iit
ran
across
my
floor
under
my
bed
and
then
it
attacked
me
attacked
you
how
it
was
like
it
pounced
on
my
face
like
a
cat
yeah
exactly
but
when
i
turned
the
lights
on
it
was
already
gone
ii
think
it
went
out
my
window
like
a
cat
yeah
no
it
was
sid
the
dummy
or
possibly
the
nightmare
of
somebody
who
had
dummies
on
her
mind
you
did
say
they
creep
you
out
excuse
me
can
i
have
a
little
support
here
please
i'm
not
just
some
crazy
person
i'm
the
slayer
the
dummy
slayer
xander
gets
a
look
from
buffy
there's
nothing
funny
about
that
well
on
the
side
of
the
'morgan's
just
crazy'
theory
there
is
willow
sees
morgan
go
by
carrying
sid
well
morgan
morgan
opens
sid's
case
i'd
like
to
see
morgan
without
his
better
half
for
a
few
minutes
bet
he
could
tell
me
something
morgan
sits
down
with
sid
on
his
lap
oh
uh
iif
it's
any
consolation
i
i
may
have
found
a
possible
demon
culprit
giles
holds
up
a
book
thethere's
a
reference
in
here
to
a
brotherhood
of
seven
demons
who
take
uh
the
form
of
young
humans
every
seven
years
these
demons
need
human
organs
aaa
brain
and
a
heart
to
maintain
their
humanity
otherwise
they
they
they
revert
back
to
their
original
form
which
is
uh
uh
slightly
less
appealing
he
hands
xander
the
book
open
to
a
sketch
of
one
of
the
demons
so
morgan
could
still
be
the
guy
only
demon
morgan
instead
of
crazy
morgan
morgan
fusses
with
sid's
shoes
it's
said
that
these
demons
are
are
are
preternaturally
strong
and
and
and
morgan
is
is
well
he
seems
to
be
getting
weaker
every
day
morgan
puts
his
hand
on
his
head
buffy
observes
him
cut
to
history
class
mrs
jackson
lectures
as
she
walks
around
the
room
it
was
as
a
result
of
this
that
president
monroe
put
forth
the
eponymous
meaning
named
after
one's
self
monroe
doctrine
which
in
one
sense
established
the
us
as
a
local
peacekeeper
she
walks
behind
buffy
who
is
intently
watching
sid
sid
turns
his
head
back
to
look
at
her
and
lowers
his
brows
buffy
is
creeped
out
and
looks
down
at
her
desk
a
moment
later
she
looks
back
up
at
him
sid
just
stares
back
cordelia
notices
and
leans
over
to
comment
looks
like
someone
digs
you
that's
adorable
you
and
the
dummy
could
tour
in
the
freak
show
she
smiles
smugly
as
she
leans
back
into
her
chair
buffy
says
nothing
she
just
looks
back
at
sid
then
down
at
her
desk
again
okay

can
tell
me
how
spain

to
this
policy
sid
is
whispering
to
morgan
mrs
jackson
notices
morgan

morgan
looks
at
sid
then

a
cupboard

first
part
of
the
nineteenth
century

buffy
looks
at

gets
up
and
goes
over
to
the
cupboard
morgan
follows
her
expectantly
before
she
gets
sid
out
she
stops
and
faces
morgan
y'know
i
wanted
to
ask
you
is
everything
okay
at
home
here
at

become
a
little
detached
mm
morgan
rubs
his
head
in
pain
you're
one
of
the
brightest
kids
i've
seen
in
a
long
time
but
lately
it
seems
like
you're
not
all
there
morgan
has
both
his
hands
on
his
head

rubbing
try
not
to
let
other
things
get
in
the
way
morgan
takes
his
hands
down
okay

i
get
sid
now
sure
she
goes
over
to
the
cupboard
and
opens
it
but
sid
is
gone
she
turns
back
to
morgan
it's
gone
gone
whadaya
mean

where
could
he
have
gone
i
put
it

buffy
willow
and
giles
come
in
willow
and
giles
have
their
arms
full
of
costumes
buffy
sees
xander
holding
sid
where
did
you
get
that
oh
i
uh
took
it
out
of
mrs
jackson's
cupboard
i
thought
you
said
you
wanted
to
be
able
to
speak
to
morgan
alone
and
uh
well
morgan's
alone
and
uh
sid's
with
me
buffy
stares
at
sid
uncomfortably
xander
manipulating
sid
hi
buffy
hi
willow
would
you
like
to
hear
some
offcolor
jokes
i
really
don't
think
you
should
be
doing
that
what
c'mon
xander
as
sid
i'm
not
real
buffy
wigged
xander
quit
it
she
turns
and
walks
a
few
steps
away
she
stops
and
looks
back
when
she
hears
xander
pounding
sid's
head
into
the
table
he's
not
real
xander
picks
sid
back
up
i
think
our
demonstration
proves
that
uh
sid
xander
knocks
on
sid's
head
several
times
is
wood
now
why
don't
you
go
and
find
morgan
and
prove
he's
whatever
he
is
i
imagine
he's
looking
for
his
puppet
i'll
go
find
morgan
buffy
starts
to
leave
but
stops
and
gives
xander
a
look
you
watch
the
dummy
xander
as
sid
byebye
now
i'm
completely
inanimate
buffy
gives
xander
another
look
and
goes
out

xander
as
sid
redrum
redruuum
what

we
have
some
hunting
of
our
own
to

once
again
i'm
banished
to
the
demon

catalog
xander
looks
at
sid
and
goes
over
to
the
table
with
him
giles
and
willow
go
up
into
the
stacks
you
concentrate
on
reanimation
theory
i'll
peck
about

organ
harvesting
unless

you
prefer
that's
okay
you
can
have
the
organs
xander
puts
sid
in
the
chair
at
the
end
of
the
table
so
i
guess
it's
just
you
and
me
huh
xander
turns
sid's
head
away
and
pats
him
that
looks
more
comfortable
he
leaves
sid
there
and
the
camera
closes
in
on
him
morgan
cut
to
the

buffy
walks
along

and
then
up

buffy
draws
a

the
makeup

tries
a
door
it's
locked
she
hears
another

close
and
turns
toward
the
sound
a
gust
blows
through
another
curtain
slowly
she
walks
toward
it
she
quickly
turns
her
head
when
she
senses
something
behind
her
and
sees

i
was
just
leaving
and
i
know
how
to
take
care
of

begins
to
read
after
a
moment
he
glances
at
sid's
chair
and
jumps
up
frightened
when
he
sees
it
empty
whoa
he
climbs
onto
the

giles
and
willow
come
running
out

continues
to
look
around
she
hears
some
creaking

backtracks
a
bit
and
goes
toward
the
noise
she
pushes
some
clothes
on
a
rack
aside
but
sees
nothing
she
continues
and
eventually
stumbles
on
something

body
lying
there

whispers
morgan
buffy
slowly
backs
away
demon's
got
himself
a
brain
she
keeps
backing
through
a
bead
curtain
and
hears
a
snapping
noise
above
she
looks
up
and
sees
a
wrought
iron
chandelier
falling
on
her
part

backstage
buffy
is
unconscious
under
the
chandelier
she
wakes
and
moans
her
vision
is
a
bit
blurred
she
hears
quick
little
footsteps
and
immediately
becomes
alert
she
sees
sid
run
across
the
catwalk
above
her
she
tries
to
lift
the
chandelier
off
of
herself
but
it's
very
heavy
sid
has
come
down
now
and
buffy
sees
him
in
the
shadows
who's
ever
out
there
i'm
gonna
hurt
you
badly
if
you'll
just
gimme
a
minute
she
tries
lifting
again
but
to
no
avail
she
looks
back
to
where
she
saw
sid
and
sees
his
knife
poised
above
her
she
turns
her
head
just
in
time
to
avoid
being
stabbed
in
the
face
sid
lifts
the
knife
and
tries
again
but
misses
buffy
flails
out
with
her
left
arm
and
knocks
him
away
she
tries
lifting
again
and
this
time
she
shifts
the
chandelier
enough
to
get
out
from
underneath
it
sid
attacks
her
from
behind
as
she
slides
out
but
she
knocks
him
away
and
into
a
wall
his
knife
goes
sliding
across
the
floor
buffy
gets
out
and
jumps
over
on
top
of
sid
pinning
him
against
the
wall
with
her
arm
you
win
now
you
can
take
your
heart
and
your
brain
and
move
on
i'm
sure
they
would
have
made
great
trophies
for
your
case
that
woulda
been
justice
yeah
except
for
one
thing
you
lost
and
now
you'll
never
be
human
yeah
well
neither
will
you
they
are
both
confused
what
cut
to
the
library
giles
and
xander
stare
at
sid
in
wideeyed
and
open
mouthed
amazement
willow
and
buffy
just
stare
and
listen
this
is
what
i
do
i
hunt
demons
yeah
you
wouldn't
know
it
to
look
at
me
let's
just
say
there
was
me
there
was
a
really
mean
demon
there
was
a
curse
and
the
next
thing
i
know
i'm
not
me
anymore
i'm
sitting
on
some
guy's
knee
with
his
hand
up
my
shirt
and
ever
since
then
you've
been
a
living
dummy
the
kid
here
was
right
all
along
i
shoulda
picked
you
to
team
up
with
but
i
didn't
because
because
you
thought
i
was
the
demon
who
can
blame
me
for
thinking
look
at
you
you're
strong
athletic
limber
sid
goes
off
into
his
own
world
nubile
sid
shakes
his
head
i'm
back
in
any
case
now
that
this
demon's
got
the
heart
and
brain
he
gets
to
keep
the
human
form
he's
in
for
another
seven
years
the
tea
kettle
is
whistling
giles
gets
up
to
tend
to
it
i
must
say
it's
a
welcome
change
to
have
someone
else
explain
all
these
things
there
were
seven
of
these
guys
i've
killed
six
if
i
can
get
the
last
one
the
curse
will
be
lifted
and
i'll
be
free
i'm
sure
it's
someone
in
that
stupid
talent
show
yeah
but
now
that
demon
has
what
he
wants
he'll
be
moving
on
so
once
we
know
who's
missing
from
the
show
we'll
know
who
our
demon
is

it's
gonna
start

kind
of
buffy
what
if
i
mess
up
cordelia
there
uh
therethere's
uh
uh
an
adage
uh
that
uh
if
you're
feeling
nervous
then
uh
you
should
imagine
the
entire
audience
are
in
their
underwear
eww
even
mrs
franklin
uhhh
perhaps
not
yeah
giles
to
everyone
um

five
minutes
for
the
um
uh
power
thing
cut
to
the
catwalk
sid
and
buffy
are
sitting
and
waiting
to
see
who's

a
demon
hunter
i'm
a
vampire
slayer
sid

slayer
sid
buffy
nods
damn

30's
korean
chick

hot
we're
talking
muscle
tone
man
we
had
some
times
sid
gets
a
look
from
buffy
hey
that
was
pre
dummy
alright
now
i
was
a
guy
so
you
kill
the
demon
and
the
curse
is
lifted
right
that's
the
drill
you
don't
actually
turn
into
a
prince
do
you
ii
mean
your
body
is
dust
and
bones
when
i
say
free
you
mean
dead
don't
get
sniffly
on
me
sis
i've
lived
a
lot
longer
than
most
demon
hunters
or
slayers
for
that
matter
buffy
looks
down
depressed
about
her
lot
in
life
sid
puts
his
hand
on
her
knee
of
course
if
you
want
to
snuggle
up
and
comfort
me
buffy
takes
his
hand
off
of
her
knee
so
that
horny
dummy
thing
really
isn't
an
act
is
it
nope
yuk
sid
and
buffy
look
down
onto
the
stage
iis
everybody
here
the
talent
gathers
on
the
stage
okay
here
comes
our
lineup
quickly
everyone
uh
um
power
circle
the
students
arrange
themselves
in
a
circle
and
hold
hands
sid
and
buffy
scan
the
group
for
any
missing
members
giles
looks
around
as
well
the
camera
follows
his
gaze
well
that's
that
then
um
everybody
uh
get
ready
some
of
the
students
don't
get
it
but
the
circle
breaks
up
quickly
as
they
scramble
to
get
ready
giles
scratches
his
head
confused
buffy
bends
down
and
slips
underneath
the
catwalk
railing
buffy
to
sid
hold
on
she
drops
to
the
stage
below
sid
watches
her
fall
she
lands
squarely
on
her
feet
and
goes
over
to
giles
no
one's
missing
so
the
demon
isn't
in
the
show
it
seems
not
uh
tell
the
others
look
it's
nearly
curtain
i
must
get
the
show
rolling
right
right
she
looks
for
sid
up
on
the
catwalk
but
he's
gone
sid
cut
to
principal
snyder
nosing
around
backstage
giles
sees
him
and
snyder
faces
him
giles
isn't
sure
why
he's
there
snyder
puts
his
fist
into
his
palm
and
walks
away
giles
follows
him
cut
to
buffy
still
looking
for
sid
sid
she
stops
next
to
a
workbench
something
drips
onto
her
arm
from
above
she
shakes
it
off
and
looks
up
she
reaches
up
to
a
shelf
to
see
what's
dripping
and
morgan's
brain
falls
down
and
into
her
hands
she
lets
out
a
startled
yelp
and
drops
the
brain
it
jiggles
when
it
hits
the
floor
part
4

the
library
willow
is
at
the
pc
buffy
walks
up
to
her
staring
at
her
hands
i'm
never
gonna
stop
washing
my
hands
so
the
dummy
tells
us
that
he's
a
demon
hunter
and
we're
like
fine
la
la
la
la
he
takes
off
and
now
there's
a
brain
does
anybody
else
feel
like
they've
been
keyser
soze'd
sid's
on
the
level
i'm
sure
of
it
but
why
would
the
demon
have
rejected
the
brain
ii
mean
i
thought
morgan
was
the
smartest
kid
in
school
he
was
look
at
his
grades
all
a's
he
was
even
taking
college
classes
wait

dale
leggett
california
institute
of
neurosurgery
cancer
ward'
xander
brain
cancer
that's
why
he
had
all
the
headaches
this
means
that
whatever's
out
there
still
needs
a
healthy
intelligent
brain
in
other
words
i'm
safe
xander
smiles
and
it's
gonna
be
looking
for
the
smartest
person
around
she
and
xander
look
at
willow
she
looks
back
and
forth
between
them
what
cut
backstage
giles
is
helping
marc
set
up
and
has
a
pair
of
weights
in
his
hands
yes
if
you
you
calibrated
the
units
of
weight
then
you
could
calculate
the
uh
specific
maximum
velocity
achieved
before
the
point
of
impact
gee
mr
giles
you're
really
smart
could
you
do
me
a
favor
cut
to
the
library
what
could
a
demon
possibly
want
from
me
what's
the
square
root
of
841
29
oh
yeah
don't
worry
willow
as
long
as
you're
with
us
there's
absolutely
no
way
that
demon
is
gonna
get
what
he
wants
cut
backstage
marc
tests
his
guillotine
on
a
honeydew
melon
giles
picks
up
a
half
melon
oh
my
pretty
cool
huh

you
sure
there's
no
one
else
who
could
help
you
out
my
assistant
got

say
anything
i'll
i'll
show
you
lie
down
giles
inspects
the
guillotine
uh
uh
how
how
exactly
does
it
work
marc
pulls
the
blade
back
up
by
its
rope
and
ties
it
down
a
good
magician
never
tells
his
secrets
he
sees
his
hand
and
arm
begin
to
revert
to
demon
form
and
shakes
his
sleeve
to
get
it
to
cover
up
better
c'mon
we
haven't
got
much
time
cut
to
the
library
buffy
is
pacing
nervously
this
is
ridiculous
we
can't
just
sit
here
and
wait
for
him
to
come
to
us
we
have
to
figure
out
who
we're
dealing
with
i
still
vote
dummy
no
okay
so
we
ruled
out
all
the
people
in
the
talent
show
that's
because
they
were
all
there
but
that's
before
we
found
the
brain
right
so
it
probably
is
one
of
them
and
and
giles
doesn't
know
he's
with
them
all
right
now
uch
giles
can
handle
himself

be
aimed
at
my
neck

your
scalp
gets
sliced
off
and
your
brains
just
come
pouring
out
he
slides
the
head
restraint
down
onto
giles'
forehead
he
reaches
over
and
locks
it
down
with
a
padlock
what
exactly
is
the
trick
trick
marc
pulls
the
chest
restraint
tighter
marc
marc
goes
over
to
the
block
where
the
rope
holding
the
guillotine
blade
is
tied
down
he
grabs
his
hatchet
and
takes
a
swing

and
the
rope
hangs
by
a
thread
marc
raises
the
hatchet
for
the
final
cut
buffy
lunges
at
him
and
tackles
him
to
the
floor
she
leg
sweeps
marc
kicking
his
legs
out
from
under
him
as
he
tries
to
get
up
she
stands
up
and
adopts
a
fighting
stance
as
marc
tries
to
get
up
again
she
throws
an
inverted
crescent
kick
to
his
face
and
he
goes
down
again
marc
growls
as
he
starts
to
get
up
and
buffy
sees
that
the
skin
on
his
face
is
beginning
to
turn
back
into
its
demon
state
ewww
marc
takes
advantage
of
her
distraction
and
jumps
up
and
punches
her
then
follows
up
with
a
backhand
fist
to
her
face
she
spins
around
and
falls
to
the
floor
the
rope
stretches
and
snaps
and
the
blade
begins
to
fall
giles
yells
out
and
clamps
his
eyes
shut
at
the
last
instant
xander
grabs
the
rope
from
midair
and
stops
the
blade
giles
hears

and
opens
his
eyes
he
sees

go
back
up
as
xander
pulls
on
the
rope
buffy
gets
up
but
is
punched
by
the
demon
and
falls
again

up
again
and
runs
over
to
marc
she
grabs
him
and
falls
backward
pulling
him
down
with
her
and
flipping
him
over
onto
his
back
she
flips
up
to
her
feet
and
turns
to
face
him
in
a
front
stance
when
he
gets
up
she
punches
him
in
the
face
and
kicks
him
in
the
stomach
with
a
hopping
front
snap
kick
he
staggers
backward
and
stumbles
into
his
disappearingact
box
and
the
door
closes
on
him
willow
keeps
hacking
at
the
lock
on
the
guillotine
how
do
you
lock
this
thing
that
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
because
marc
just
punches
through
the
box
and
reaches
for
her
she
quickly
backs
away
as
he
kicks
and
shoves
his
way
out
of
the
box
he
has
completely
reverted
to
his
demon
form

up
against
a
wall
with
his
hand
around
her
throat

pulls
her
away
and
slams

only
watch
as
he
holds
on
to
the
rope
willow
gets
the
lock
to
break
and
quickly
pulls
it
off
she
and
giles

restraint
up
and
he
gets
out
as
fast
as
he
can
he
reaches
down
to
undo
the
restraint
at
his
feet
sid
finally
shows
up

onto
the
demon's
back
and
begins
stabbing
with
his

the
demon
ignores

and
continues
slamming
buffy
into
the
wall

the
demon
to
let

buffy
and
has
jumped

hits
the
demon
in
the
face
with
an
open
hand
punch
followed
by
a
backhand
punch
giles
gets
off
of
the
bench
as
buffy
does
a
full
spinning
side
kick
to
the
demon's
gut
making

stagger
back
onto
the
bench
and
land
with
his
neck
in
the
guillotine

off
the
demon's
head

body
slumps
lifeless
on
the
bench
willow
cringes
at
the
sight
they
all
stare
at
what's
left
of
the
demon
uh
i
must
say
all
of
you
your
ttiming
is
impeccable
and
now
for
the
big
finish
he
has
positioned
himself
over
the
demon's
chest
with
his
knife
what
are
you
doing
it's
not
enough

come
back

of
this'll
be
over
she
holds
out
her
hand
for
the
knife
let
me
i
got
it
thanks
he
wields
back
with
the
knife
and
plunges
it
into
the
demon's
heart
he
pulls
back
to
do
it
again
but
his
aim
was
true
the
first
time
and
he
just
slumps
over
onto
the
demon
with
the
knife
still
in
his
hands
now
a
lifeless
puppet
buffy
looks
at
sid
sadly
and
lets
out
a
deep
breath
giles
takes
off
his
glasses
buffy
gently
lifts
sid
from
the
demon
and
holds
him
in
her
arms
she
starts
to
walk
offstage
