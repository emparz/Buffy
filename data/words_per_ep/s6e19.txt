open
in
willow's
bedroom
daylight
overhead
shot
of
the
room
various
items
of
clothing
strewn
across
the
floor
pan
across
the
floor
sound
of
giggling
pan
further
to
reveal
willow
and
tara
snuggling
together
on
the
bed
under
red
sheets
when
did
morning
happen
after
the
moon
went
down
willow
giggles
leans
up
and
they
kiss
for
a
while
then
willow
lies
back
down
with
her
head
on
tara's
stomach
tara
caresses
her
shoulders
mmm
i
forgot
how
good
this
could
feel
us
together
willow
pause
without
the
magic
there
was
plenty
of
magic
willow
smiles
then
sighs
it's
getting
late
tara
small
frown
wanna
get
up
no
willow
tara
laughing
oh
god
no
willow
quietly
i
was
just
thinking
about
buffy
tara
frowns
oh
she
still
isn't
back
i
didn't
hear
her
she
wouldn't
talk
about
what
happened
at
the
magic
shop
when
she
got
home
last
night
she
just
wanted
to
know
how
close
i
was
to
tracing
the
camera
signal
back
to
the
empire
of
the
nerds
and
then
she
left
again
i'm
sure
she'll
be
okay
yeah
i'm
not
really
worried
about
her
going
up
against
warren
and
the
others
i
know
this
is
going
to
sound
crazy
but
i
think
something
might
be
going
on
with
spike
and
buffy
willow
pause
i
mean
she
looked
so
hurt
when
she
saw
him
with
anya
i
think
maybe
they've
been
sleeping
together
willow
laughs
no
i
wouldn't
go
that
far
no
i
mean
she
told
me
they've
been
sleeping
together
willow
sits
up
to
stare
at
tara
sleeping
together
you
mean
like
the
naked
kind
of
together
tara
sighs
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
say
anything
but
i
i
promised
her
i
wouldn't
willow
shocked
does
everybody
else
know
am
i
the
only
one
she
didn't
god
no
she
she
didn't
even
mean
to
tell
me
it
just
came
out
willow
still
shocked
how
could
she
hide
something
like
this
from
me
i
think
she
was
afraid
of
the
look
you'd
get
on
your
face
tara
willow
staring
at
her
kinda
like
the
one
you're
wearing
now
oh
no
i'm
not
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
so
is
she
wow
she
probably
really
needs
someone
to
talk
to
probably
willow
continues
absorbing
the
news
as
tara
strokes
her
hair
we've
been
kinda
busy
maybe
we
didn't
hear
her
come
home
willow
nods
uncertainly
cut
to
the
hallway
willow
wearing
a
large
football
shirt
knocks
on
a
closed
door
buffy
she
opens
the
door
revealing
the
neatly
made
notsleptin
bed
willow
frowns
closes
the
door
and
starts
back
toward
her
room
shot
of
another
closed
door
starting
to
open
dawn
os
she
back
yet
willow
stops
turns
back
dawn
appears
in
the
doorway
willow
nervously
uh
not
yet
i'm
sure
she'll
be
home
soon
everything's
fine
just
go
back
to
bed
it's
ten
o'clock
willow
surprised
oh
uh
dawn
comes
closer
you
don't
think
she's
gonna
hurt
spike
do
you
she
told
you
about
spike
it
was
kinda
obvious
after
last
night
willow
covering
yeah
i
totally
knew
it
must
have
hurt
so
much
to
see
him
and
and
and
anya
like
that
and
poor
xander
everything
is
so
screwed
up
it's
gonna
be
all
right
it's
just
complicated
you
know
when
when
people
have
such
strong
feelings
for
each
other
sometimes
is
she
back
yet
tara
emerges
from
the
bedroom
with
the
sheet
wrapped
around
her
dawn's
face
lights
up
tara
sees
dawn
and
looks
mildly
alarmedembarrassed
oh
hey
dawn
starting
to
smile
delighted
oh
you
and
tara
smiling
uh
that's
my
cue
to
put
some
clothes
on
tara
turning
back
toward
the
bedroom
no
no
no
no
i'm
totally
not
here
you
guys
you
do
whatever
you
want
um
i'll
go
watch
tv
dawn
giggles
downstairs
really
loud
in
the
basement
where
i
can't
hear
anything
dawn
squeals
oh
my
god
dawn
rushes
off
giggling
excitedly
tara
and
willow
grin
at
each
other
head
back
toward
the
bedroom
dawn
reappears
almost
immediately
i
love
you
guys
she
squeals
some
more
and
dashes
off
again
willow
and
tara
smile
and
continue
on
cut
to
some
door
somewhere
it
explodes
inward
toward
the
camera
and
buffy
appears
in
the
doorway
wearing
a
red
leather
jacket
buffy
calls
all
right
let's
make
this
quick
reveal
the
interior
of
the
geek
trio's
lair
still
decorated
in
cheesy
lovepad
fashion
but
empty
of
people
buffy
looks
quite
displeased
she
walks
down
the
stairs
into
the
lair
looks
around
fine
but
i'm
not
leaving
till
we
have
a
little
chat
she
wanders
over
to
a
desk
there's
an
imac
and
a
bunch
of
papers
on
it
buffy
frowns
picks
up
some
of
the
papers
looks
around
more
pan
over
a
variety
of
geektype
knickknacks
and
such
very
little
considering
the
pummeling
that
needs
to
occur
she
looks
at
a
shelf
where
a
bunch
of
action
figures
are
set
up
mostly
of
women
in
extremely
skimpy
outfits
buffy
pokes
one
of
them
makes
a
face
turns
away
i
mean
guys
helloooo
slayer
here
did
you
honestly
think
i
wouldn't
find
you
she
gets
distracted
by
more
piles
of
paper
and
stuff
on
a
chair
she
sifts
through
them
picks
some
up
frowns
continues
walking
she
discovers
the
whiteboard
on
which
the
nerd
herd
had
written
their
evil
plans
buffy
turns
it
on
its
squeaky
axle
to
reveal
the
surface
all
it
says
now
is
too
late
buffy
frowns
well
that
can't
be
good
suddenly
a
huge
circular
buzzsaw
cuts
through
the
whiteboard
and
comes
slicing
toward
buffy
cutting
through
everything
in
its
path
sawdust
and
debris
flying
everywhere
buffy
shields
her
face
with
her
hands
dives
to
the
floor
just
in
time
to
avoid
being
sliced
in
two
several
more
saws
appear
at
all
angles
moving
around
the
room
some
horizontally
some
vertically
some
on
a
diagonal
buffy
does
a
flip
to
duck
under
one
and
over
another
she
grabs
a
pile
of
random
papers
and
stuff
and
runs
for
the
door
one
saw
gets
caught
in
the
stairwell
just
below
her
feet
cut
to
outside
buffy
bursts
out
of
the
house
and
falls
onto
the
grass
papers
flying
everywhere
she
groans
and
sits
up
we
see
that
she's
holding
a
large
old
book
she
looks
down
at
herself
close
shot
on
her
stomach
her
red
leather
jacket
has
a
big
gash
in
it
just
deep
enough
to
cut
the
fabric
but
not
her
flesh
buffy
annoyed
okay
that's
gonna
cost
ya
wolf
howl
opening
credits
act
i

open
on
exterior
shot
of
the
summers
house
day
cut
to
inside
willow
and
tara
come
down
the
stairs
dressed
arms
around
each
other
smiling
they
go
into
the
living
room
okay
we're
here
ready
for
action
uh
bad
guy
fighting
action
willow
giggles
reveal
buffy
sitting
on
the
sofa
holding
some
papers
and
dawn
on
the
floor
beside
her
eating
something
willow
and
tara
exchange
affectionate
looks
guys
you
didn't
have
to
you
know
if
you
still
wanna
be
alone
no
no
we're
good
willow
still
with
the
amorous
looks
we're
better
than
good
buffy
and
dawn
smiling
too
great
willow
softly
super
willow
and
tara
kiss
briefly
then
begin
kissing
more
intensely
buffy
and
dawn
watch
with
aw
faces
dawn
giggles
awww
okay
all
right
we'll
stop
oh
you
better
not
so
um
nerds
how
are
them
they
well
i
found
their
lair
but
they
obviously
knew
we
were
tracing
their
signal
they
left
in
a
hurry
van
was
gone
but
everything
else
was
still
there
we
should
go
back
uh
tara
and
i
can
sherlock
around
there's
nothing
left
there
now
giant
buzz
saw
it
was
a
thing
buffy
indicating
papers
this
was
all
that
i
could
save
i
i
know
it's
not
much
but
we
need
to
go
through
it
and
see
if
we
can
find
anything
that
might
tell
us
what
what
they're
doing
where
they're
going
willow
and
tara
kneel
on
the
floor
we
see
that
the
coffee
table
is
covered
with
the
rest
of
the
papers
and
stuff
that
buffy
salvaged
from
the
nerds'
lair
tara
picks
up
a
large
book
it
has
a
buzzsaw
cut
right
across
the
middle
and
it
falls
in
half
as
she
picks
it
up
um
tara
chuckling
this
might
take
a
while
anything
we
can
do
to
fast
forward
we
really
need
to
find
warren
and
the
others
before
anyone
else
gets
hurt
should
we
call
xander
buffy
grimaces
i
don't
think
he's
really
in
the
scooby
space
we
need
to
give
him
some
time
maybe
they've
heard
something
in
the
demon
bars
about
those
guys
dawn
tentatively
looking
at
buffy
spike
buffy
quickly
spike
spike's
not
part
of
the
team
dawn
softly
so
he's
not
going
to
be
around
anymore
dawn
willow
and
tara
looking
concerned
uh
i
don't
know
dawn
not
not
for
a
while
dawn
ponders
this
what
about
anya
she
might
be
able
to
help
with
some
of
the
demon
texts
i'm
guessing
she's
not
feeling
real
researchy
right
now
sound
of
sniffling
crying
cut
to
a
restaurant
day
a
blonde
woman
sits
at
the
bar
with
a
martini
glass
in
front
of
her
she's
crying
and
has
her
head
down
so
we
can't
see
her
face
but
her
hair
and
build
and
clothing
resemble
anya's
but
as
the
camera
pulls
out
we
see
that
anya
is
actually
sitting
next
to
the
crying
woman
i
know
how
you
feel
maybe
i
can
help
how
could
carl
do
that
to
me
that
bastard
he's
a
man
look
no
further
but
with
my
sister
she's
not
even
pretty
anya
taken
aback
well
it
isn't
always
about
looks
anya
crying
woman
looking
skeptical
or
a
beating
heart
sometimes
intimate
sweaty
relations
with
the
wrong
person
just
seems
like
a
good
idea
at
the
time
crying
woman
angrily
she's
fat
he
cheated
on
me
with
my
fat
ugly
sister
crying
woman
continues
crying
likes
'em
fleshy
huh
bet
you
wish
he'd
bloat
up
a
coupla
thousand
pounds
and
pop
like
a
big
ol'
meat
zeppelin
don't
you
he
said
he
loved
me
oh
gee
then
he
must
have
meant
it
'cause
hey
guys
never
say
anything
they
don't
really
mean
do
they
but
we
they
say
i
love
you
and
and
you
think
it's
true
anya
crying
woman
staring
at
her
they
say
oh
anya
i
want
to
be
with
you
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
and
you
believe
them
you
believe
they
feel
the
same
way
about
you
because
that's
the
way
love's
supposed
to
be
right
who's
anya
and
then
you
get
all
excited
with
the
tingly
anticipation
but
wait
not
so
fast
there's
the
apocalypse
aand
the
back
from
the
grave
and
the
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
and
by
the
time
you're
finally
standing
there
in
that
beautiful
expensive
white
dress
you've
dreamed
about
ever
since
you
became
human
he's
gets
all
heebiejeebie
and
decides
you
know
i'd
rather
just
go
steady
beat
the
other
woman
has
stopped
crying
now
she
just
looks
bitter
men
suck
i
wish
carl's
flesh
would
and
you
know
he
said
it
isn't
me
but
how
can
i
believe
him
i
mean
he
knew
he
didn't
want
to
get
married
deep
down
he
knew
but
he
lied
to
me
every
day
for
months
i
wish
he
lied
and
lied
and
then
lied
some
more
'cause
hey
who's
gonna
notice
with
all
the
other
lies
flying
around
like
little
monkeys
and
then
he
thinks
he
can
just
sweep
the
carnage
underneath
the
rug
by
saying
oh
cut
to
some
sort
of
underground
cavern
a
looming
shapeless
shadow
moves
across
the
wall
i'm
sorry
sorry
pan
down
and
reveal
andrew
sitting
on
the
floor
and
scooting
backwards
on
his
butt
as
the
looming
creature
pursues
him
down
the
tunnel
sorry
please
i'll
never
try
to
desecrate
your
chamber
again
we
finally
get
a
look
at
the
thing
chasing
him
it's
a
huge
brown
scaly
demon
with
thorny
things
protruding
from
its
chin
a
sort
of
triangular
head
teeth
like
needles
just
don't
hurt
me
please
andrew
has
backed
into
a
corner
the
demon
continues
advancing
then
we
see
warren
and
jonathan
behind
the
demon
warren
zaps
it
with
a
cattle
prodtaser
blue
electricity
sparkles
around
the
demon
and
it
growls
in
pain
hit
him
again
hit
him
again
warren
continues
zapping
the
demon
until
it
falls
over
wow
these
things
are
tougher
than
i
thought
warren
as
andrew
gets
up
and
joins
them
you
know
one
jolt
from
this
should
have
dropped
an
elephant

andrew
grabs
the
prod
from
warren
you
want
a
piece
of
this
huh
andrew
zapping
the
demon
repeatedly
not
so
tough
are
you
now
puff
'n
stuff
hey
hey
we
need
him
fresh
all
right
not
smoke
house
andrew
stops
zapping
i'm
done
being
the
bait
next
time
one
of
you
can
wiggle
on
the
hook
warren
goes
over
to
the
demon
and
squats
down
to
look
at
it
if
this
works
then
next
time
we'll
be
the
thing
that
everyone's
afraid
of
okay
so
what
now
warren
has
a
switchblade
knife
in
his
hand
he
flicks
open
the
blade
well
now
it's
your
turn
sparky
warren
reverses
the
knife
so
he's
holding
it
by
the
blade
then
tosses
it
to
jonathan
who
catches
it
he
looks
at
it
uncertainly
then
makes
a
disgusted
face
cut
to
spike's
crypt
night
spike
holds
a
glass
of
blood
in
one
hand
and
a
bottle
of
liquor
in
the
other
he
pours
liquor
into
the
blood
puts
the
bottle
down
takes
a
slow
sip
dawn
os
does
it
help
spike
looks
over
his
shoulder
behind
him
dawn
is
standing
in
the
doorway
with
a
white
bag
over
her
shoulder
spike
looks
back
at
his
glass
doesn't
hurt
he
looks
over
at
dawn
again
she
fidgets
a
little
not
planning
a
campout

sleeping
over
at
janice's

smiles
slightly
staring
into
his
glass
oh
so
the
birds
are
flying
again

spike
bitterly

grand
he
turns
to
sit
in
his
armchair
not
looking
at
dawn
i
wanted
to
stop
by
on
my
way
and
you
know
dawn
beat

spike
staring
into
the
distance
it's
complicated
nibblet
dawn
small
laugh
everybody's
been
saying
that
must
be
true
then
spike
drinking
was
it
worth
it
what
you
did
with
anya
spike
looks
over
at
her
in
surprise
buffy
told
you
dawn
shrugs
kinda
caught
the
show
there
was
a
camera
somewhere
in
the
magic
box
dawn
spike
looking
shocked
warren
and
jonathan
and
that
other
guy
have
been
watching
buffy
spike
sighing
angrily
wankers
dawn
walks
down
the
steps
and
a
few
feet
into
the
room

pained

at
her
oh

treating

sighing
in
exasperation

a
bit
of
the
evil
left
in
me

turns
to
leave
close
on
spike
staring
sadly
into
his
drink
as
the
door
closes
cut
to
a
different
part
of
the
underground
tunnel
it's
lit
with
candles
across
the
tunnel
at
one
point
there's
a
shimmery
magical
barrier
a
demon
like
the
one
that
the
nerds
stunned
earlier
comes
walking
down
the
tunnel
when
it
gets
to
the
barrier
it
simply
keeps
walking
the
barrier
flashes
with
orange
light
and
makes
sizzling
noises
as
the
demon
walks
through
it
as
the
demon
continues
on
warren
and
andrew
emerge
from
a
nook
in
the
tunnel
and
go
over
to
the
barrier
this
is
it
we
found
it
you
sure
it's
in
there
andrew
starts
to
go
over
to
the
barrier
but
warren
stops
him
careful
only
nezzla
demons
can
pass
through
the
barrier
warren
picks
up
a
rock
from
the
ground
and
tosses
it
at
the
barrier
it
sizzles
and
burns
to
nothing
in
an
instant
everything
else
gets
curlyfried
jonathan
os
this
sucks
jonathan
comes
walking
out
of
the
nook
he
is
wearing
the
other
demon's
skin
like
a
suit
covering
his
whole
body
it's
much
bigger
than
him
so
it
hangs
loosely
around
him
the
headskin
is
hanging
like
a
hood
so
that
jonathan's
head
is
free
just
make
sure
all
your
skin's
covered
jonathan
whining
why
can't
i
just
use
a
glamor
you
can't
siegfried
and
roy
the
barrier
it's
gotta
be
the
real
deal
warren
reaches
behind
jonathan
and
pulls
the
headhood
over
jonathan's
head
jonathan
yells
in
dismay
the
other
two
laugh
ahh
jonathan
muffled
disgusted
it's
still
wet
jonathan
the
head
is
also
too
big
and
jonathan's
eyes
barely
show
through
the
eyeholes
good
then
it
should
still
be
fresh
enough
jonathan
muffled
should
be
wait
a
minute
what
do
you
mean
what
do
you
mean
should
be
still
laughing
warren
grabs
jonathan
and
shoves
him
into
the
barrier
jonathan
screams
the
barrier
sizzles
and
flashes
and
lets
him
through
he
falls
to
the
ground
on
the
other
side
warren
chuckling
to
andrew
huh
wasn't
sure
that
would
work
andrew
looks
surprised
and
a
little
uncertain
on
the
other
side
of
the
barrier
jonathan
gets
up
and
composes
himself
jonathan
muttering
muffled
jackass
he
shuffles
off
down
the
corridor
you
think
he
knows
well
if
he
did
why
would
he
be
here

zillion
years
how
do
we

they
still
work
suddenly
a
bright
purple
light
explodes
from
each
orb
surrounding
warren
the
light
begins
to
pulse
rhythmically
from
each
globe
and
through
warren's
body
he
gasps
and
his
eyes
glow
purple
he
starts
to
laugh
ohh

glowing
orbs
into
a
small
leather
bag
attached
to
his
belt

growling
warren

demon
comes
around

corner
growling
let's

warren
rushes
at
the
demon
it
hits
him
and
he
flies
against
a
wall
turns
back
and
grabs
the
demon's
arm
and
kicks
it
in
the
back
of
the
legs
the
demon
falls
to
its
knees
warren
wraps
his
arms
around
its
head
and
twists
breaking
the
demon's
neck
it
falls
down
dead

outside
xander's

buffy
stands
in
front
of
the
door
it
opens
to
reveal
xander
he
doesn't
look
thrilled
to
see
buffy
hey

xander
turns
away
leaving
the
door
open
we
see
that
he
has
a
beer
can
in
his
hand
he
walks
back
into
the
apartment
buffy
follows
him
in
closing
the
door
behind
her
i
think
there's
still
a
cold
one
in
the
fridge
thanks
but
uh
i
think
it's
still
a
little
early
for
me
xander
just
looks
at
her
then
sits
on
a
sofa
buffy
sits
on
a
chair
opposite
buffy
softly
she
loves
you
you
know
that
anya
was
just
she
was
hurting
she
was
hurting
and
and
she
did
this
really
stupid
thing
with
your
boyfriend
he's
not
my
boyfriend
i
know
why
anya
i
understand
i
do
xander
shaking
his
head
but
you
buffy
looks
down
at
her
feet
xander
still
shaking
head
all
those
times
i
told
spike
to
get
lost
that
he
didn't
have
a
chance
with
a
girl
like
you
xander
laughs
bitterly
you
don't
know
how
hard
it's
been
what
lying
to
me
buffy
angrily
being
here
after
i
was
brought
back
xander
looks
chastised
buffy
sighs
calms
down
you
have
no
idea
how
hard
it
is
just
being
here
you
could
have
told
me
you
didn't
want
to
know
so
you
went
to
him
instead
xander
what
i
do
with
my
personal
life
is
none
of
your
business
xander
softly
it
used
to
be
buffy
fidgets
like
she
doesn't
know
how
to
answer
that
it
just
happened
okay
xander
chuckles
bitterly
oh
like
uh
say
you're
evil
get
on
me
you
fought
side
by
side
with
him
when
i
was
gone
you
let
him
take
care
of
dawn
but
i
never
forgot
what
he
really
is
xander
buffy
looking
hurt
god
what
were
you
thinking
buffy
laughs
you're
asking
me
that
oh
'cause
your
decision
making
skills
have
really
sparkled
lately
i'm
not
saying
i
didn't
make
any
mistakes
but
last
time
i
checked
slaughtering
half
of
europe
wasn't
one
of
them
he
doesn't
have
a
soul
buffy
just
some
leash
they
jammed
in
his
head
you
think
he'd
still
be
all
snuggles
if
that
chip
ever
stopped
working
would
you
still
trust
him
with
dawn
then
buffy
resigned
it
doesn't
matter
i'm
not
seeing
him
anymore
it's
over
yeah
there's
a
lot
of
that
going
around
xander
crumples
up
the
beer
can
in
his
hand
tosses
it
aside
gets
up
and
walks

chances
are
i'd
up

square
in
the

warren
barely
even
moves
xander
clutches
his

xander
lies
on
the
floor
groaning
in
pain
warren
walks
quickly
toward
him
shoving
a
pool
table
out
of
the
way
as
if
it
were
nothing
xander
is
bleeding
from
the
nose
blood
running
down
his
face

jonathan
warren
sighing
exasperated
if

that's
all

warren
sighs
and
nods
reluctantly
he
bends
over
a
little
to
address
xander
it's
your
lucky
night

we're
just
gonna
leave
him
there

turns
and
walks
off
andrew
follows
casually
jonathan
makes
a
little
apologetic
handgesture
at
xander
and
follows
the
others
cut
to
summers
house
foyer
the
door
opens
and
xander
enters
his
face
still
bloody
xander
calls
buffy
i
found
warren
he
glances
around
xander
actually
my
face
kinda
found
him
he
stops
as
he
sees
spike's
leather
jacket
hanging
on
the
banister
xander
strides
over
to
it
picks
it
up
his
expression
is
grim
as
he
starts
up
the
stairs
cut
to
the
bathroom
xander
bursts
in
holding
the
jacket
this
what
you
call
not
seeing
spike
anymore
he
pauses
as
he
sees
buffy
she's
sitting
on
the
floor
looking
very
upset
what
did
he
do
close
on
buffy's
legs
her
robe
hangs
loosely
and
one
thigh
is
exposed
with
a
big
ugly
bruise
on
the
inside
of
the
thigh
did
he
hurt
you
buffy
sighing
shaking
her
head
he
tried
he
didn't
son
of
a
bitch
xander
turns
to
storm
out
buffy
softly
don't
xander
stops
in
the
doorway
buffy
tearfully
please

xander
stares
at
her
in
concern
a
loud
doorslamming
noise
from
downstairs
makes
them
both
jump
willow
rushes
in
smiling
hey
i
think
we
finally
have
something
she
pauses
seeing
xander's
bloody
face
and
buffy's
bruised
condition
buffy
quickly
pulls
her
robe
down
to
hide
the
bruise
on
her
leg
what
happened
nothing
xander
looks
down
at
buffy
as
she
composes
herself
what'd
you
find
out
cut
to
the
dining
room
a
little
later
buffy
now
dressed
sits
at
the
table
with
willow
and

xander
stands
nearby
holding
an
ice
pack
against
his
face
the
table
is
covered
with
the
papers
and
books
from
the
geek
lair
plus
willow's
computer

were
able
to
decipher
pretty
much
everything
except
these
willow
holds
a
set
of
papers
with
weird
symbols
on
them
it
isn't
written
in
any
ancient
language
we
could
identify
xander
chuckling
it's
klingon
they're
love
poems
xander
catching
himself
embarrassed
which
has
nothing
to

insidious
scheme

to
describe
what

protesting
and
struggling
flash
back
to

the
ground
several
yards
away
and
gets
up
again
warren
striding
toward
her
i
was
wondering
when
super
bitch
would
show
up
you
really
got
a
problem
with
strong
women
don't
you
nothing
i
can't
handle
buffy
ducks
his
first
swing
the
second
catches
her
in
the
face
warren
blocks
her
punch
holds
her
arm
and
hits
her
with
his
other
hand
they
exchange
a
few
blows
and
buffy
goes
down
warren
you
seem
a
little
off
this
a
bad
day
buffy
gets
up
it's
getting
better
she
lands
several
strong
kicks
in
a
row
grabs
warren
and
flips
over
him
kicks
him
from
behind
he
goes
down
and
immediately
rolls
back
to
his
feet
buffy
grabs
the
large
metal
door
that
warren
ripped
off
the
truck
and
hits
him
with
it
he
stumbles
into
the
stone
gate
hard
bits
of
plaster
dust
fall
on
his
head
that
all
you
got
he
looks
up
a
moment
too
late
as
the
stone
gate
collapses
a
pile
of
stone
and
rubble
falling
right
on
warren's
head
engulfing
him
andrew
screams
no
jonathan
stares
in
dismay
buffy
looks
over
at
the
other
two
geeks
there's
two
ways
this
can
end
and
right
now
i'm
thinking
they're
both
gonna
hurt
andrew
suddenly
starts
to
smile
i
think
you're
right
buffy
turns
around
to
see
warren
emerging
from
the
rubble
what's
the
matter
baby
you
never
fight
a
real
man
before
blackout
act
iv

same
scene
warren
lands
two
strong
punches
on
buffy
before
she
ducks
the
third
and
kicks
him
he
blocks
her
swing
lands
several
more
punches
buffy
grabs
his
hand
and
twists
around
holding
warren's
arm
behind
him
and
kicking
him
in
the
stomach
she
ducks
another
punch
and
kicks
him
he
falls
against
the
overturned
armored
truck
buffy
watches
as
warren
pulls
himself
upright
again
wow
that
almost
hurt
kitten
buffy
kicks
him
and
punches
him
several
times
with
little
effect
warren
grabs
her
and
slams
down
on
her
arm
buffy
makes
an
expression
of
pain
warren
kicks
her
backward
grabs
her
again
kill
her

her
jonathan
stares
from
the
fight
to
andrew
and
back
looking
alarmed
warren
continues
beating
on
buffy
he
gets
her
legs
out
from
under
her
and
she
goes
down
you
know
who
i
am
huh
slayer

a
murderer
buffy
getting
up
well
that
too
but
more
to
the
point
buffy
swings
at
him
he
blocks
the
punch
and
backhands
her
warren
i'm
the
guy
that
beat
you
again
she
swings
again
he
blocks
and
hits
her
buffy
reels
backward
looking
shocked
and
it's
not
the
muscles
baby
he
kicks
her
backward
it's
the
brains
i'll
remember
that
when
i
knock
'em
clean
out
of
your
suddenly
jonathan
leaps
onto
buffy
from
behind
grabbing
her
around
the
neck
buffy
grunts
and
stumbles
forward
trying
to
pry
him
off
warren
amused
whoa
sparky
i
didn't
think
you
had
it
in
you
close
on
jonathan
and
buffy
struggling
jonathan
mutters
into
buffy's
ear
through
gritted
teeth
jonathan
quietly
to
buffy
the
orbs
smash
his
orbs
buffy
throws
him
off
he
lands
on
the
ground
and
rolls
away
as
warren
attacks
again
buffy
blocks
a
couple
of
punches
but
then
warren
lands
one
that
sends
her
falling
against
a
park
bench
the
bench
breaks
into
pieces
warren
strides
over
as
buffy
is
still
lying
in
the
wreckage
of
the
bench
say
good
night
bitch
warren
pulls
his
fist
back
for
a
final
punch
this
pulls
his
jacket
back
revealing
the
pouch
on
his
belt
buffy
sees
it
before
warren
can
move
she
lunges
forward
grabs
the
pouch
and
slams
it
against
the
ground
blue
light
flashes
suffusing
warren
then
leaving
him
and
shooting
toward
the
smashed
orbs
warren
looks
dazed
buffy
stands
up
good
night
bitch
she
does
a
serious
spinkick
that
sends
warren
flying
back
and
tumbling
to
the
ground
near
his
comrades
he
climbs
slowly
to
his
feet
looking
scared
buffy
advancing
you're
nothing
but
a
sad
little
boy
warren
but
it's
time
you
grow
up
and
pay
for
what
you've
done
warren
panting
get
away
from
me
he
pulls
off
his
jacket
revealing
an
apparatus
strapped
to
his
body
including
a
pair
of
silvery
tanks
on
his
back
warren
i

stares
in
disbelief
as
warren
pulls
a
switch
and
the
jetpack
activates
lifting
him
straight
up
into
the
air
buffy
sighing
almost
whining

shooting
up
into
the
sky

of
the

andrew
to

the
game

far
from

andrew
activates
his
jetpack
and
lifts
off
as
buffy
and
jonathan
stare

andrew
was
standing
underneath
a
roof
overhang
he
hits
it
with
his
head
hard
and
falls
to
the
ground

below
in

softly
no

move
to

sidebyside
on

a
deep
breath

drive
the
past
few
weeks

thought

didn't
trust
me
enough
to
tell
me
about

xander
pauses
softly
it
hurt
i'm
sorry
i
should
have
told
you
xander

smile

you
would
have
if
i
hadn't
given
you
so
many
reasons
to
think

be
an
ass
about
it

done
