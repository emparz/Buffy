the
knights
on

you
should
realize
that
all
of
the
above
flashes
by
much
too
fast
to
really
see
the
scenes
from
first
season
probably
last
for
about
ten
frames
each
and
by
the
time
it
gets
to
fifth
season
they
flash
by
two
frames
at
a
time
so
the
sense
of
increasing
speed
and
urgency
carries
us
into
an
alleyway
as
the
previously
scenes
meld
into
the
episode
the
camera
moves
down
the
alley
as
from
the
pov
of
someone
running
fast
urgent
music
we
go
around
a
corner
and
see
the
person
who's
running
it's
a
teenage
boy
he
rounds
the
corner
and
stops
seeing
that
he's
in
a
dead
end
slowly
fearfully
he
turns
shot
of
the
corner
he
just
came
around
the
kid
moves
very
slowly
back
toward
the
corner
very
scared
suddenly
someone
steps
around
the
corner
it's
a
large
male
vampire
the
kid
starts
takes
a
step
back
the
vampire
strides
forward
with
a
small
smile
gave
me
a
pretty
good
run
there
bet
the
blood's
just
pumpin'
the
boy
backs
away
frightened
vamp
advancing
bet
it's
hot
kid
voice
breaking
don't
hurt
me
don't
hurt
you
vamp
laughs
suddenly
one
of
the
doors
along
the
alley
opens
and
buffy's
head
pops
out
buffy
innocently
hey
what's
going
on
the
vamp
turns
his
head
to
glare
at
her
help
me
call
the
police
get
outta
here
girl
vamp
turns
back
to
the
kid
buffy
emerging
from
the
doorway
you
guys
havin'
a
fight
'cause
you
know
fighting's
not
cool
the
vampire
turns
to
glare
at
her
again
get
out
of
here
no
vamp
turns
fully
toward
buffy
no
she
wants
to
stay
i
don't
mind
a
little
appetizer
buffy
small
frown
walks
forward
have
you
ever
heard
the
expression
'biting
off
more
than
you
can
chew'
the
vamp
frowns
shakes
his
head
okay
um
how
about
the
expression
'vampire
slayer'
what
the
hell
you
talkin'
about
wow
never
heard
that
one
okay
how
about
'oh
god
my
leg
my
leg'
the
vampire
growls
and
lunges
at
her
she
ducks
his
grab
punches
him
in
the
face
and
kicks
his
leg
his
knee
buckles
and
he
falls
to
the
ground
oh
god
my
leg
uhh
see
now
we're
communicating
the
vamp
surges
up
grabs
buffy
and
throws
her
against
the
wall
he
grabs
her
again
but
she
pushes
his
arms
away
punches
him
in
the
face
knees
him
then
goes
around
behind
him
and
kicks
him
into
the
wall
he
lands
against
a
dumpster
turns
and
backhands
buffy
who
stumbles
forward
toward
the
boy
the
boy
leaps
out
of
the
way
the
vamp
punches
buffy
again
picks
her
up
and
slams
her
down
on
top
of
another
dumpster
shot
of
the
kid
cowering
in
the
corner
buffy
kicks
the
vamp
cartwheels
off
the
dumpster
and
kicks
him
again
then
again
and
then
yet
again
on
the
final
kick
he
lands
on
his
back
among
a
pile
of
wooden
boxes
they
all
shatter
one
of
the
shards
of
wood
flies
toward
buffy
and
she
catches
it
as
the
vampire
lunges
up
out
of
the
boxes
she
stakes
him
with
the
piece
of
wood
the
boy
watches
in
shock
the
vamp
turns
to
dust
buffy
drops
the
makeshift
stake
and
stares
at
the
pile
of
dust
as
the
boy
continues
to
cower
in
the
background
wow
been
a
long
while
since
i
met
one
who
didn't
know
me
she
turns
to
go
pauses
and
looks
at
the
kid
you
should
get
home
she
begins
walking
back
toward
the
door
she
came
out
of
hhow'd
you
do
that
angle
on
buffy's
back
as
she
walks
toward
the
door
she
doesn't
turn
or
stop
as
she
replies
it's
what
i
do
but
you're
you're
just
a
girl
buffy
pauses
in
the
doorway
that's
what
i
keep
saying
she
walks
through
the
door
wolf
howl
opening
credits
act
i

open
on
buffy
coming
in
the
back
door
of
the
magic
shop
walking
down
the
hall
and
into
the
main
room
we
see
xander
sitting
at
the
round
table
with
giles
beside
him
looking
at
books
and
spike
sitting
behind
them
on
the
ladder
leading
up
to
the
loft
smoking
a
cigarette
something
goin'
on
out
back
buffy
walks
over
to
table
vampire
oh
buffy
sighs
anything
angle
on
giles
sitting
at
the
table
with
a
few
books
open
in
front
of
him
nothing
you
want
to
hear
the
ritual
is
uh
explain
it
again
there's
nothing
new
to
go
through
it
again
everyone
looks
nervously
at
buffy
we
see
willow
sitting
at
the
table
on
xander's
other
side
giles
slowly
removes
his
glasses
shot
of
anya
standing
to
the
side
the
key
was
living
energy
it
needed
to
be
channeled
poured
into
a
specific
place
at
a
specific
time
the
energy
would
flow
into
that
spot
the
walls
between
the
dimensions
break
down
it
stops
the
energy's
used
up
the
walls
come
back
up
glory
uses
that
time
to
get
back
into
her
own
dimension
not
caring
that
all
manner
of
hell
will
be
unleashed
on
earth
in
the
meantime
buffy
looks
grim
um
but
only
for
a
little
while
right
the
walls
come
back
up
uh
nno
more
hell
that's
only
if
the
energy
is
stopped
and
now
the
key
is
human

willow
looks
over
her
shoulder
at
buffy
is
dawn
giles
reads
from
book
the
blood
flows
the
gates
will
open
the
gates
will
close
when
it
flows
no
more
giles
removes
his
glasses
when
dawn
is
dead
pause
i
have
places
to
be
everyone
looks
over
at
tara
who
is
curled
up
in
a
chair
to
the
side
she
falls
silent
again
and
they
return
to
their
conversation
why
blood
why
dawn's
blood
i
mean
why
couldn't
it
be
like
a
a
lymph
ritual
'cause
it's
always
got
to
be
blood
we're
not
actually
discussing
dinner
right
now
blood
is
life
lackbrain
why
do
you
think
we
eat
it
it's
what
keeps
you
going
makes
you
warm
makes
you
hard
makes
you
other
than
dead
spike
quietly
course
it's
her
blood
pretty
simple
math
here
we
stop
glory
before
she
can
start
the
ritual
we
still
have
a
couple
of
hours
right
if
my
calculations
are
right
but
buffy
i
don't
wanna
hear
it
buffy
turns
away
i
understand
that
buffy
whirls
back
no
no
you
don't
understand
we
are
not
talking
about
this
giles
jumps
up
from
the
table
yells
yes
we
bloody
well
are
beat
everyone
looks
shocked
by
giles'
outburst
giles
quieter
if
glory
begins
the
ritual
if
we
can't
stop
her
come
on
say
it
we're
bloody
well
talking
about
this
tell
me
to
kill
my
sister
giles
whispers
she's
not
your
sister
buffy
pause
no
she's
not
she's
more
than
that
she's
me
the
monks
made
her
out
of
me
i
hold
her
and
i
feel
closer
to
her
than

buffy
looks
down
sighs
it's
not
just
the
memories
they
built
it's
physical
dawn
is
a
part
of
me
the
only
part
that
i
buffy
stops
we'll
solve
this
we
will
don't
have
another
coma
okay
buffy
gives
a
small
smile
giles
quietly
if
the
ritual
starts
then
every
living
creature
in
this
and
every
other
dimension
imaginable
will
suffer
unbearable
torment
and
death

giles
looks
up
at
buffy
including
dawn
then
the
last
thing
she'll
see
is
me
protecting
her
giles
quietly
you'll
fail
you'll
die
we
all
will
giles
turns
away
from
the
table
i'm
sorry
shot
of
the
others
looking
at
her
as
giles
walks
slowly
away
i
love
you
all
but
i'm
sorry
she
turns
away
too
giles
turns
back
to
look
at
her
beat
anya
loudly
okay
anya
raises
her
hand
all
in
favor
of
stopping
glory
before
the
ritual
suggestions
ideas
anya
snapping
her
fingers
time's
awastin'
uh
when
you
say
you
love
us
all
xander
and
giles
in
unison
shut
up
willow
i
bet
you've
got
some
dark
spell
abrewin'
uh
make
her
a
a
a
toad
little
hoppy
toad
we
can
hit
her
with
a
hammer
tara
giggling
hoppy
toad
what
about
ben
he
can
be
killed
right
i
mean
i
know
he's
an
innocent
but
you
know
not
like
dawn
innocent
we
could
kill
a
regular
guy
pause
while
everyone
considers
this
and
xander
realizes
what
he's
said
xander
softly
in
selfdisgust
god
it's
doubtful
he'll
surface
again
this
close
to
the
ritual
we
can
expect
it's
glory
we're
dealing
with
we
don't
have
to
kill
her
uh
we
just
have
to
stop
her
from
doing
the
ritual
i
mean
there's
only
the
one
time
that
she
can
do
it
right
yeah
we
get
her
on
the
ropes
we
just
gotta
keep
her
occupied
till
it's
too
late
okay
but
i'm
still
not
hearing
enough
ideas
she's
a
god
let's
think
outside
the
box
why
don't
you
go
think
outside
the
bleeding
box
yes
anya
apart
from
your
incredibly
uninfectious
enthusiasm
have
you
anything
else
to
contribu
the
dagon
sphere
sorry
when
buffy
first
met
glory
she
found
that
magical

anya
gestures
glowy
sphere
that
was
meant
to
repel
glory
we've
got
it
in
the
basement
anya
everyone
looks
surprised
it
might
drive
her
away
or
hurt
her
ooh
anya
hurries
over
to
a
display
case
gestures
like
a
gameshow
hostess
and
olaf
the
troll
god's
enchanted
hammer
we
see
the
hammer
episode
triangle
on
a
shelf
you
wanna
fight
a
god
use
the
weapon
of
a
god
buffy
walks
over
to
check
out
the
hammer
uh
nah
that
thing's
too
heavy
to
spike
buffy
picks
it
up
easily
yeah
good
i
like
this
buffy
to
anya
thanks
here
to
help
wanna
live
smart
chicks
are
soooo
hot
xander
looking
fondly
at
anya
you
couldn't
have
figured
that
out
in
tenth
grade
willow
and
xander
exchange
a
smile
well
we
have
some
ideas
if
we
could
actually
get
glory
on
the
run
but
um
but
we
still
have
no
idea
how
to
find
her
big
day
oh
it
calls
me
i
have
to
be
there
everyone
looks
at
tara
then
at
buffy
buffy
looks
thoughtful
big
day
cut
to
ben
entering
the
back
room
at
the
warehouse
he
still
wears
the
ceremonial
robe
and
is
holding
a
pile
of
clothing
a
few
minions
are
in
the
background
shot
of
dawn
sitting
on
the
floor
with
her
knees
up
to
her
chest
eyes
closed
ben
walks
over
to
her
they
uh
said
you
have
to
put
this
on
for
the
ceremony
what
if
i
don't
come
on
just
what
if
i
don't
like
the
color
look
i
i
wish
there
was
another
way
and
i
wish
you'd
fall
on
your
head
and
drown
in
your
own
barf
so

dawn
shrugs
i
guess
we're
both
disappointed
i
think
it'll
be
quick
actually
sir
the
bleeding
is
quite
a
slow
process
to
give
the
portal
time
to
ben
annoyed
thank
you
for
the
information
ben
to
dawn
i'll
do
what
i
can
to
change
what
change
be
her
i
don't
wanna
look
at
you
ben
shakes
head
dawn
i
don't
think
you
wanna
be
glory
be
glory
dawn
yelling
glory
glory
glory
will
you
just
stop
ben
morphs
into
glory
shouting
already
dawn
scowls
huh
glory
shakes
out
the
garment
she's
holding
it's
a
medievalstyle
dress
she
examines
it
then
turns
to
dawn
so
what's
the
hubbub
bub
glory
sits
in
a
chair
what
do
you
got
against
old
benjy
he's
a
monster
at
least
you're
upfront
about
it
glory
picking
at
the
hem
of
the
dress
don't
be
so
hard
on
the
boy
he
just
wants
to
live
most
guys
would
do
the
same
besides
he's
probably
the
reason
your
sis
and
her
little
cartoon
pals
are
still
alive
that
little
nagging
pinch
of
humanity
that
makes
me
go
for
the
hurt
instead
of
the
kill
glory
looks
at
dawn
lowering
myself
to
trade
blows
with
the
slayer
when
i
should
have
just
put
my
fist
through
her
heart
glory
stands
up
and
holds
up
the
dress
to
look
at
it
it's
gotta
be
ben
or
maybe
you
just
can't
take
her
glory
tosses
the
dress
to
dawn
who
takes
hold
of
one
end
glory
is
still
holding
the
other
end
and
she
suddenly
yanks
on
it
pulling
dawn
to
her
feet
they
face
off
hmm
funny
thing
you've
been
here
for
a
few
hours
now
and
i
haven't
seen
big
sis
galloping
in
to
save
you
she
probably
knows
what
a
terrible
mistake
that'd
be
she's
not
afraid
of
you
oh
no
sweetie
baby
i'm
talking
about
the
ritual
'cause
you
know
i
bleed
you
the
portals
open
but
once
you
die
they
close
the
faster
you
die
the
better
for
your
sorry
species
glory
puts
her
hand
on
the
side
of
dawn's
face
dawn
looks
scared
i'm
bettin'
buffy
knows
that
since
she's
not
really
your
sister
i'm
guessin'
she
isn't
gonna
show
and
if
she
does
dawn
winces
in
pain
as
glory's
fingers
tighten
on
her
head
it
might
not
be
to
save
you
glory
shoves
dawn
aside
she
falls
to
the
floor
on
top
of
a
grating
glory
smirks
at
her
angle
on
dawn's
face
shooting
up
from
below
as
her
face
is
pressed
against
the
grating
dawn
whispers
buffy
cut
to
buffy
in
the
workout
room
punching
the
punchingbag
she
alternates
hands
and
hits
it
with
a
steady
rhythm
the
camera
pulls
out
and
reveals
giles
entering
walking
toward
her
you
sure
you're
not
going
to
tire
yourself
out
buffy
stops
punching
i'm
sure
she
resumes
punching
close
shot
on
buffy's
face
with
giles
out
of
focus
in
the
background
we're
still
working
on
ideas
giles
buffy
stops
punching
time's
short
but
uh
best
leave
it
to
the
last
moment
giles
buffy
stretching
her
arms
if
we
go
in
too
early
and
she
takes
us
out
no
chance
of
getting
her
to
miss
her
window
then
we
wait
buffy
gives
one
last
punch
that
breaks
the
punching
bag
off
its
chain
it
falls
to
the
floor
buffy
stares
at
it
gives
her
arm
a
shake
i
imagine
you
hate
me
right
now
same
angle
on
buffy
with
giles
in
the
background
her
back
to
him
she
sighs
but
doesn't
answer
giles
takes
a
few
steps
closer
i
love
dawn
i
know
but
i've
sworn
to
protect
this
sorry
world
and
sometimes
that
means
saying
and
doing
what
other
people
can't
what
they
shouldn't
have
to
buffy
turns
to
face
him
you
try
and
hurt
her
and
you
know
i'll
stop
you
i
know
overhead
shot
of
the
two
of
them
buffy
walks
slowly
over
to
the
sofa
in
the
corner
and
sits
giles
paces
slowly
over
to
the
sofa
as
well
this
is
how
many
apocalypses
for
us
now
oh
uh
well
giles
sits
takes
off
his
glasses
six
at
least
giles
sits
back
slowly
feels
like
a
hundred
i've
always
stopped
them
always
won
yes
i
sacrificed
angel
to
save
the
world
cut
to
close
angle
on
buffy's
face
i
loved
him
so
much
but
i
knew
what
was
right
i
don't
have
that
any
more
i
don't
understand
i
don't
know
how
to
live
in
this
world
if
these
are
the
choices
if
everything
just
gets
stripped
away
i
don't
see
the
point
i
just
wish
that
buffy
tearfully
i
just
wish
my
mom
was
here
she
gets
up
walks
a
few
paces
away
turns
to
face
giles
the
spirit
guide
told
me
that
death
is
my
gift
guess
that
means
a
slayer
really
is
just
a
killer
after
all
i
think
you're
wrong
about
that
it
doesn't
matter
if
dawn
dies
i'm
done
with
it
i'm
quitting
she
walks
out
leaving
giles
sitting
on
the
sofa
alone
cut
to
the
warehouse
dawn
is
now
wearing
the
ritual
dress
she
has
her
other
clothing
folded
in
a
neat
pile
and
carries
it
over
to
the
chair
lays
the
clothing
down
on
the
chair
kneels
beside
the
chair
shot
of
glory
off
to
the
side
writing
something
a
minion
goes
to
her
and
whispers
dawn
kneels
by
the
chair
and
arranges
her
sneakers
neatly
in
front
of
the
chair
she
looks
up
when
glory
begins
to
speak
okay
campers
it's
almost
stab
time
glory
smiling
you
two
get
her
two
minions
move
toward
dawn
who
looks
scared
and
backs
away
no
no
aah
dawn
screams
buffy
she
continues
to
scream
as
the
minions
grab
her
arms
and
drag
her
away
glory
watches
them
go
with
a
smile
see
you
in
a
few
cut
to
outside
the
minions
drag
dawn
into
the
courtyard
area
where
the
crazy
people
are
still
working
sparks
fly
from
someone's
welding
dawn
looks
up
apprehensively
shot
of
a
huge
metal
tower
basically
build
out
of
scaffolding
it
stretches
into
the
air
above
the
warehouse
at
the
top
a
narrow
walkway
protrudes
out
into
the
air
we
see
the
tower
first
from
dawn's
perspective
on
the
ground
looking
up
and
then
a
longer
shot
from
the
side
dawn
continues
to
stare
up
at
the
tower
as
the
minions
lead
her
to
some
stairs
at
the
base
of
the
tower
and
they
begin
to
climb
blackout
act
ii

open
on
giles
in
the
magic
shop
walking
over
to
a
door
and
opening
it
it
leads
down
some
stairs
into
the
basement
which
is
cluttered
as
any
basement
tends
to
be
giles
calling
any
luck
have
you
found
the
dagon
sphere
pan
down
to
the
basement
anya
emerges
from
behind
the
stairs
wearing
a
bra
quickly
putting
on
her
blouse
anya
calling
um
i'm
sure
it's
here
just
be
a
minute
xander
emerges
as
well
fastening
his
pants
xander
calling
yeah
we're
on
it
let's
look
over
here
where
we
didn't
look
yet
xander
and
anya
continue
fastening
their
clothing
the
angle
is
such
that
giles
can't
see
them
giles
os
time
is
a
factor
yes
yes
not
to
worry
sound
of
the
door
closing
anya
picks
up
a
clipboard
and
examines
it
so
are
you
more
uh
relaxed
anya
looking
through
boxes
no
no
i
mean
it
sounded
like
you
uh

xander
paces
past
her
arrived
anya
distracted
no
anya
tunes
back
in
to
the
conversation
yes
um
i
had
the
pleasure
moment
and
the
blissful
calm
that
comes
right
after
it
but
that
only
lasted
a
couple
of
seconds
and
now
i'm
terrified
again
well
you
don't
have
to
be
anya
moves
toward
another
pile
of
stuff
xander
turns
and
pulls
down
a
dropcloth
revealing
the
buffy
bot
gah
he
leaps
back
making
anya
jump
as
well
what
they
both
stare
at
the
bot
it
sits
there
with
eyes
open
unmoving
spike's
sexbot
why
didn't
they
just
melt
it
down
into
scrap
anya
moves
away
as
xander
continues
staring
at
the
bot
maybe
willow
wanted
it
xander
turns
to
her
i
don't
think
willow
feels
that
way
about
about
buffy
i
mean
i
know
she's
gone
through
a
lot
of
changes
but
to
study
it
right
robotics
xander
embarrassed

science
xander
moves
to
another
pile
of
stuff
and
they
both
continue
looking
separately
pervert
other
pervert
and
don't
frighten
me
like
thaaah
she
shrieks
as
she
sees
something
in
another
box
xander
comes
over
to
look
god
who
who
would
put
something
like
that
there
is
this
supposed
to
be
some
sort
of
sick
joke
she
picks
it
up
it's
a
small
toy
bunny
i
mean
things
aren't
bad
enough
anya
pause
this
is
an
omen
hey
hey
shh
xander
rubs
her
shoulders
no
no
it's
an
omen
it's
a
higher
power
trying
to
tell
me
through
bunnies
that
we're
all
gonna
die
oh
god
no
it's
not
anya
puts
the
bunny
back
in
the
box
as
xander
puts
his
arms
around
her
waist
from
behind
it's
okay
no
you
see
usually
when
there's
an
apocalypse
i
skedaddle
but
now
i
love
you
so
much
that
instead
i
have
inappropriately
timed
sex
and
try
to
think
of
ways
to
fight
a
god
and
worry
terribly
that
something
might
happen
to
you
and
also
worry
that
something'll
happen
to
me
and
then
i
have
guilt
that
i'm
not
more
worried
about
everyone
else
but
i
just
don't
have
enough
i'm
just
on
total
overload
and
i
honestly
don't
think
that
i
could
be
more
nervous
than
i
am
right
now
care
to
wager
on
that
xander
lifts
his
hand
into
the
shot
he
holds
a
small
box
open
to
reveal
the
ring
inside
anya
stares
at
it
xander
lets
her
go
and
she
turns
to
face
him
still
looking
at
the
ring
anya
you
wanna
marry
me
anya
stares
at
him
a
moment
then
slaps
him
across
the
face
can
i
take
that
as
a
maybe
you're
proposing
to
me
yes
you're
proposing
to
me
'cause
we're
gonna
die
and
you
think
it's
romantic
and
sexy
and
and
you
know
you're
not
gonna
have
to
go
through
with
it
'cause
the
world's
gonna
end
i'm
proposing
to
you
anya
because
it's
not
you
can't
know
that
i
believe
it
i
think
we're
gonna
get
through
this
i
think
i'm
gonna
live
a
long
and
silly
life
and
i'm
not
interested
in
doing
that
without
you
around
anya
softly
oh
okay
xander
wideeyed
okay
yes
anya
small
smile
i
mean
yes
they
both
smile
happily
and
look
down
at
the
ring
xander
begins
removing
the
ring
from
the
box
as
anya
holds
up
her
hands
then
she
stops
him
no
no
after
give
it
to
me
when
the
world
doesn't
end
xander
smiles
slightly
anya
puts
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
they
kiss
cut
to
the
main
magic
shop
room
willow
sits
at
the
table
reading
books
while
tara
naps
behind
her
buffy
walks
up
will
what
do
you
got
for
me
some
ideas
willow
buffy
goes
to
sit
on
the
stairs
leading
up
to
the
loft
well
notions
or
theories
based
on
wild
speculation
did
i
mention
i'm
not
good
under
pressure
i
need
you
will
you're
my
big
gun
willow
alarmed
i'm
your
no
ii
was
never
a
gun
someone
else
should
be
the
gun
i
i
could
be
a
a
cudgel
or
or
a
pointy
stick
you're
the
strongest
person
here
you
know
that
right
willow
frowns
well
no
will
you're
the
only
person
that's
ever
hurt
glory
at
all
you're
my
best
shot
at
getting
her
on
the
ropes
so
don't
get
a
jelly
belly
on
me
now
well
i
i
do
sort
of
have
this
one
idea
but
last
few
days
i've
mostly
been
looking
into
ways
to
help
tara
ii
know
that
shouldn't
be
my
priority
buffy
leans
over
and
puts
her
hand
on
willow's
knee
of
course
it
should
willow
smiles
gratefully
buffy
leans
back
well
i've
been
charting
their
essences
mapping
out
i
think
if
i
can
get
close
enough
i
may
be
able
to
reverse
what
glory
did
like
take
back
what
she
took
from
tara
it
might
weaken
glory
or
make
her
less
coherent
or
it
might
make
all
our
heads
explode
giles
os
buffy
buffy
looks
up
across
the
room
we
see
giles
xander
and
anya
gathered
around

puts
her
hand
gently
on
willow's

willow's
face
the
real
kind
spike
looks
over
at
her
she
looks
at
him
but
thanks
spike
nods
puts
the
flask
away
shot
of
the
tower
people
are
walking
toward
it
as
sparks
from
welding
come
from
the
yard
below
cut
to
the
warehouse
the
crazy
people
are
still
doing
various
things
with
machinery
and
metal
pan
over
to
the
entrance
as
tara
enters
finally
pulling
the
cast
off
her
hand
and
tossing
it
aside
she
walks
in
muttering
to
herself
goes
over
to
a
pile
of
bricks
and
picks
one
up
a
hand
grabs
tara's
shoulder
from
behind
and
spins
her
around
you
what
are
you
doing
here
willow
appears
beside
glory
she's
with
me
willow
grabs
both
glory's
and
tara's
heads
they
all
scream
as
blue
lightning
begins
to
flicker
around
them
bright
blue
light
appears
to
stream
from
glory's
head
to
tara's
suddenly
a
blast
of
power
separates
them
all
three
go
flying
in
different
directions
willow
crashes
into
a
pile
of
wood
glory
lands
on
her
back
on
the
concrete
sits
up
as
several
minions
run
over
what
the
frickin'
hell
did
that
bitch
do
to
me
the
minions
look
at
each
other
then
at
glory
minion
anxiously
you
look
fine
truly
glory
clutching
her
head
she
made
a
little
she
made
a
hole
uh
i
need
a
brain
to
eat
oh
take
mine
oh
groovetastic
one
minion
bows
i
said
a
brain
you
worthless
dirt
she
puts
a
hand
to
her
forehead
and
begins
to
walk
distractedly
as
the
minions
follow
her
with
concern
big
day
i
got
places
to
be
big
day
need
a
brain
she
looks
at
something
directly
in
front
of
her
scoffs
suppose
i
could
always
use
yours
buffy
os
okay
then
buffy
stands
there
with
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
back
the
camera
zooms
in
on
her
come
and
get
it
blackout
act
iii

open
on
glory
still
staring
at
buffy
glory
starts
to
smile
then
looks
away
and
moves
her
arms
as
if
in
pain
buffy
innocently
you
don't
seem
very
well
your
little
witch
bitch
gave
me
kind
of
a
headache
there
glory
removes
her
ceremonial
robe
revealing
the
simple
black
dress
underneath
but
if
you
think
this
is
gonna
last
more
than
eight
seconds
i
noticed
you're
talking
whereas
in
your
position
i
would
attack
me
the
minions
have
taken
glory's
robe
as
she
continues
to
stand
there
looking
weakened
oh
most
sweatynaughtyfeelingscausing
one
should
we
go
guard
the
girl
this
is
a
this
is
a
a
diversionary
tactic
go
guard
the
minions
scurry
away
they
pull
a
bunch
of
crazies
away
from
their
work
and
gather
them
around
the
base
of
the
stairs
leading
up
to
the
tower
cut
back
to
glory
still
standing
there
unsteadily
it's
strange
you're
not
as
blurry
with
speed
as
usual
either
the
witch
it's
not
her
buffy
produces
the
dagon
sphere
from
behind
her
might
be
this
glory
looks
alarmed
i
heard
it's
supposed
to
repel
you
so
my
guess
is
you
probably
shouldn't
touch
it
either
buffy
tosses
the
sphere
at
glory
who
catches
it
instinctively
the
sphere
lights
up
and
seems
to
warp
the
air
around
it
when
it
touches
glory's
hand
she
makes
a
pained
face
drops
her
hand
to
her
side
close
shot
on
glory's
hand
holding
the
sphere
she
slowly
crushes
the
sphere
and
the
light
goes
out
as
it
crumbles
you're
gonna
wish
you
buffy
punches
her
in
the
face
glory
stumbles
back
and
buffy
kicks
her
then
punches
her
again
and
again
and
again
the
minions
and
crazies
gathered
around
the
stairs
mutter
and
look
around
nervously
as
the
fight
continues
stand
fast
kill
anyone
who
dares
approach
this
will
be
our
day
of
glory
well
punned
well
it
just
called
out
to
me
suddenly
an
arrow
appears
in
his
chest
and
he
falls
back
we
see
spike
holding
his
crossbow
having
just
shot
the
minion
anya
and
giles
are
beside
him
they
rush
forward
and
begin
fighting
the
minions
while
spike
stays
behind
giles
blocks
a
minion's
staff
while
anya
beats
on
another
one
with
her
bat
spike
gives
a
loud
battle
cry
and
jumps
on
two
minions
at
once
bearing
them
to
the
ground
giles
slices
at
a
minion
with
his
sword
a
minion
has
spike
around
the
waist
as
another
one
approaches
spike
fights
them
both
cut
to
a
wide
overhead
shot
of
the
fighting
off
to
the
side
we
see
buffy
hitting
and
kicking
glory
cut
to
above
dawn
looks
down
and
her
eyes
widen
as
she
spots
buffy
cut
to
below
buffy
flips
glory
over
and
slams
her
down
on
a
pile
of
bricks
tries
to
punch
her
but
glory
rolls
aside
and
buffy
ends
up
punching
the
bricks
buffy
tries
to
punch
again
and
glory
grabs
her
arms
throws
her
across
the
room
willow
sits
up
among
broken
pieces
of
wood
looks
at
buffy
fighting
glory
looks
over
to
her

happily
i
will
always
find
you
long
shot
of
the
two
of
them
embracing
cut
back
to
glory
she
stands
up
straight
you
know
what
buffy
punches
but
glory
grabs
her
fist
i'm
feeling
a
little
better
and
now
i'm
a
little
bored
oh
i'm
sorry
cause
you're
about
glory
kicks
her
in
the
face
buffy's
head
goes
flying
off
leaving
her
body
standing
we
can
see
the
wires
exposed
in
the
neck
the
body
falls
over
as
glory
stares
in
bewilderment
when
it
hits
the
floor
sparks
fly
out
of
the
neck
glory
staring
hey
wow
the
slayer's
a
robot
glory
looks
around
did
everybody
else
know
the
slayer
was
a
robot
glory
smiles
in
triumph
as
the
real
buffy
appears
behind
her
glory
glory
stops
smiling
turns
buffy
hits
her
with
olaf's
hammer
glory
flies
across
the
room
crashes
into
a
wall
you're
not
the
brightest
god
in
the
heavens
are
you
buffy
i'm
up
here
buffy
looks
up
as
dawn
screams
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
shot
of
the
tower
from
buffy's
pov
we
can't
really
make
out
dawn
at
the
end
of
the
platform
buffy
buffy
runs
toward
the
tower
leaps
over
a
pile
of
bricks
and
onto
the
stairs
a
minion
confronts
her
but
she
punches
him
and
throws
him
over
the
side
glory
picks
herself
up
looks
over
and
sees
buffy
running
up
the
stairs
oh
no
you
don't
dawn
screams
buffy
i'm
up
here
cut
to
midway
up
the
stairs
there's
one
last
level
after
which
the
stairs
end
and
the
only
way
up
is
via
ladders
buffy
is
ascending
onto
this
level
as
glory
appears
in
front
of
her
and
hits
her
buffy
hits
glory
with
the
hammer
then
glory
kicks
her
into
the
scaffolding
they
exchange
a
few
more
blows
and
buffy
loses
her
grip
on
the
hammer
which
goes
flying
it
gets
caught
in
some
chain
that's
hanging
off
the
tower
glory
grabs
another
piece
of
chain
and
uses
it
to
swing
around
the
side
knocking
buffy
aside
as
buffy
tries
to
reach
the
hammer
buffy
falls
aside
gets
up
takes
another
kick
from
glory
and
swings
around
the
scaffolding
kicks
glory
ducks
a
punch
and
goes
around
glory
kicks
her
from
behind
dawn
looking
down
buffy
buffy
tries
to
continue
climbing
but
glory
hits
her
in
the
leg
making
buffy
gasp
in
pain
they
exchange
some
more
blows
then
buffy
resumes
climbing
up
the
outer
scaffolding
glory
goes
around
beside
her
and
climbs
up
as
well
kicks
buffy
as
she's
scaling
up
a
pipe
buffy
slides
back
down
to
the
previous
level
buffy
runs
up
a
ramp
kicks
glory
in
the
face
runs
down
the
ramp
again
and
manages
to
free
the
hammer
she
swings
it
at
glory
and
hits
her
a
couple
of
times
also
hits
a
ladder
which
falls
aside
glory
hits
buffy
in
the
face
and
she
loses
her
balance
as
she
falls
backward
she
grabs
glory
and
they
both
fall
off
the
tower
they
both
hit
the
concrete
below
a
few
feet
away
from
each
other
the
hammer
lands
nearby
shot
of
spike
still
fighting
two
minions
at
once
buffy
gets
to
her
feet
glory
does
too
buffy
grabs
glory
by
the
shoulders
and
pushes
her
away
glory
winds
up
a
few
dozen
feet
away
beside
a
wall
you
lost
your
hammer
sweet
cheeks
what
are
you
gonna
hit
me
with
now
buffy
looks
at
the
wall
glory
turns
to
the
wall
also
just
as
a
huge
wreckingball
crashes
through
the
wall
and
into
glory
it
crashes
through
a
second
wall
deposits
glory
on
the
other
side
and
swings
back
whatever's
handy
buffy
turns
and
runs
off
cut
to
xander
driving
the
machine
that
controls
the
wrecking
ball
he
shuts
down
the
engine
and
sits
back
looking
satisfied
the
glorified
bricklayer
picks
up
a
spare
cut
to
the
hammer
lying
on
the
ground
buffy
grabs
it
as
she
runs
past
cut
to
spike
anya
and
giles
taking
refuge
behind
something
has
anyone
noticed
we're
going
backwards
spike
straightens
up
to
peek
over
the
top
of
the
machine
a
brick
hits
him
in
the
forehead
he
ducks
down
again
looking
annoyed
it's
crossed
my
mind
shot
of
the
group
of
crazies
standing
between
them
and
the
stairs
glaring
at
them
there
are
also
a
few
minions
giles
panting
as
long
as
buffy
can
keep
glory
down
long
enough
it
doesn't
matter
giles
looking
up
at
the
tower
there's
only
a
few
minutes
left
to
start
the
ritual
cut
to
buffy
hitting
glory
with
the
hammer
glory
doesn't
seem
able
to
fight
back
just
stands
there
reeling
each
time
buffy
hits
her
cut
to
dawn
looking
down
at
the
fight
suddenly
she
looks
up
and
gasps
we
see
doc
standing
at
the
other
end
of
the
platform
inside
the
tower

can
help
me

doc
whispers

dawn
looks
fearfully
at
him
suddenly
he
produces
a
large
shiny
knife
holds
it
up
in
front
of
his
face
dawn
gasps
and
cringes
lingering
shot
of
doc
holding
the
knife
up
with
a
small
smile
blackout
act
iv

open
on
a
shot
up
at

over
a
fence
and
comes
to
join
the
others

anya
and
giles

still
crouched
behind
their
shelter
looking
up
at
the
tower

a
tie

still
gazing
up
someone's
up
there
shot
of
the
underside

pov

hand
behind

without
looking
back
tara
puts
her
own
hand
in
willow's
the
entire
crowd
of
minions
and
crazies
suddenly
parts
into
two
halves
like
the
red
sea
they
all
yell
in
surprise
an
unseen
force
is
shoving
them
aside
as
spike
runs
through

reaches
the
stairs
and
leaps
up
them
without
slowing

gets
to
the
last
level
runs
up

and
begins
climbing
the
ladder
cut
to
the

pocketwatch
and
looks
at

gives

more
times
we
don't

during
this
just
buffy
as
she
slams
the
hammer
down
over
and
over

there
with

into
ben
