a
really
fun
time

a
confused
look
from
oz

great
uh
my
time
was
also
of
the
good
mine

willow
awkwardness
sets
in
well
then
oz
raises
his
eyebrows
expectantly
willow
looks
past
him
and
sees
buffy
down

hall

my
friend

at
willow
and
buffy
walking
away
larry
bites

mastered
the
single
entendre
larry
notices
a
pretty
girl
coming
down
the
hall
and
ignores
the
insult
to
stare
at
her
as
she
goes
by
he
taps
her
books
and
they
fall
out
of
her
hands

gives

a
dirty
look
and
leaves
so

innocent
schoolgirl

an
evil
mastermind

walking
along

colonnade
nowhere

gonna
wait
until
i
was
ready
but
i'm
ready

lot
of

your
wily
willow
charms
at
last
count
all
of
them
maybe
more
well
none
of
them

a
thing
they
all
get

'f'
in
willow

buffy

willow
realizes
her
insensitivity

minutes
there

anyway
cut
inside
cordelia's
car
in
a
secluded
area
of
the
park
that
night
she
and
xander
are
making
out
suddenly
xander
breaks
off
but
what
could
she
possibly
see
in
him
excuse
me
we
didn't
come
here
to
talk
about
willow
we
came
here
to
do
things
i
can
never
tell
my
father
about
because
he
still
thinks
i'm
a
good
girl
i
just
don't
trust
oz
with
her
i
mean
he's
a
senior
he's
attractive
okay
maybe
not
to
me
but
and
he's
in
a
band
and
we
know
what
kind
of
element
that
attracts
i've
dated
lots
of
guys
in
bands
xander
nods
thank
you
do
you
even
wanna
be
here
i'm
not
running
away
because
when
you're
not
babbling
about
poor
defenseless
willow
you
are
raving
about
the
allpowerful
buffy
i
do
not
babble
i
occasionally
runon
every
now
and
then
i
yammer
xander
yeah
look
around
we're
in
my
daddy's
car
it's
just
the
two
of
us
there
is
a
beautiful
big
full
moon
outside
tonight
it
doesn't
get
more
romantic
than
this
cordelia
insistent
so
shut
up
they
start
making
out
again
cut
outside
the
camera
pulls
away
from
the
car
into
the
bushes
until
a
large
hairy
beast
watching
them
comes
into
view
it
growls
menacingly
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

inside
cordelia's
father's
car
at
the
park
she
and
xander
are
sucking
face
xander
hears
some
rustling
outside
and
breaks
off
did
you
hear
that
what
is
it
now
i
thought
i
heard
something
iis
willow
sending
out
some
sorta
distress
signal
that
only
you
can
hear
huh
he
smiles
at
her
sheepishly
and
they
go
back
to
it
an
instant
later
xander
hears
more
rustling
louder
this
time
and
pulls
back
again
okay
now
i
know
i
heard
something
alright
that's
it
you
know
your
mind
hasn't
been
here
all
night
how
about
i
just
drop
you
off
a
hairy
arm
with
a
clawed
hand
punches
through
the
convertible
top
cordelia
screams
and
makes
a
grab
for
the
keys
get
us
outta
here
the
creature
on
the
roof
of
the
car
snarls
as
it
reaches
around
for
them
inside
the
keys
aren't
in
the
ignition
and
cordelia
frantically
searches
for
them
on
the
floor
cordelia
screams
where
are
the
keys
we
should
be
moving
let's
go
cordelia
finds
the
keys
oh
i
got
'em
got
'em
she
fumbles
with
the
keys
but
manages
to
get
them
into
the
ignition
and
starts
the
car
she
puts
it
into
reverse
and
screams
as
she
guns
the
car
backward
a
ways
and
then
slams
on
the
brakes
the
beast
tumbles
off
of
the
back
and
into
a
tree
cordelia
gets
the
car
in
drive
and
speeds
away
the
camera
shows
the
car
from
above
with
a
gaping
hole
in
the
ragtop
as
it
maneuvers
back
to
the
road
and
races
off
told
ya
i
heard
something
cut
to
the
school
parking
lot
the
next
day
buffy
inspects
the
hole
in
the
roof
and
you're
sure
it
was
a
werewolf
buffy
gets
off
of
the
car
well
let's
see
um
six
feet
tall
claws
a
big
old
snout
in
the
middle
of
his
face
like
a
wolf
um
yeah
i'm
sticking
with
my
first
guess
seems
wise
oh
oh
and
then
there
was
that
little
thing
where
it
tried
to
bite
us
it
was
so
awful
cordelia
puts
her
head
on
xander's
shoulder
xander
puts
his
arm
around
her
i
know
cordelia
tears
herself
away
daddy
just
had
this
car
detailed
giles
comes
up
behind
buffy
with
a
newspaper
so
what's
the
word
well
it
seems
there
were
a
a
number
of
other
attacks
by
a
wild
dog
around
town
giles
hands
the
paper
to
buffy
several
animal
carcasses
were
found
mutilated
you
mean
like
bunnies
and
stuff
willow
upset
no
don't
tell
me
willow
looks
at
oz
oz
reassuringly
oh
don't
worry
i
mean
they
might
not
look
it
but
bunnies
can
really
take
care
of
themselves
willow
calmer
and
smiling
yeah
yeah
giles
takes
the
paper
back
yes
uh
um
fortunately
no
people
were
injured
that
falls
into
the
'that's
a
switch'
column
well
for
now
but
my
guess
is
that
this
werewolf
will
be
back
at
next
month's
full
moon
what
about
tonight's
full
moon
giles
confused
pardon
well
last
night
was
the
night
before
the
full
moon
traditionally
known
as
'the
night
before
the
full
moon'
giles
meaning
the
accepted
legend
that
werewolves
only
prowl
during
a
full
moon
might
be
erroneous
or
it
could
be
a
crock
unless
the
werewolf
was
using
last
year's
almanac
looks
like
giles
has
some
schooling
to
do
yes
i
must
admit
i
i
am
intrigued
werewolves
it's
it's
one
of
the
classics
giles
start
away
i
i'm
sure
my
books
and
i
are
in
for
a
fascinating
afternoon
giles
leaves
buffy
and
cordelia
watch
him
go
xander
smirks
at
giles'
typical
behavior
he
needs
to
get
a
pet
cut
to
the
gym
the
class
is
seated
on
the
bleachers
listening
to
the
female
selfdefense
coach
sunnydale
is
becoming
more
dangerous
all
the
time
and
a
full
moon
like
tonight
tends
to
bring
out
the
crazies
but
with
some
simple
basics
of
selfdefense
each
of
you
can
learn
how
to
protect
yourself
buffy
quietly
to
willow
here's
a
suggestion
move
away
from
the
hellmouth
what
you
wanna
do
is
gain
advantage
of
the
situation
as
quickly
as
possible
willow
smiles
at
buffy's
suggestion
behind
her
oz
reaches
up
and
turns
the
tag
sticking
out
of
her
sweatshirt
back
inside
she
looks
back
at
him
curiously
tag
oz
pats
her
on
the
back
willow
smiles
at
buffy
cut
to
xander
and
cordelia
your
attacker
may
have
the
benefit
of
surprise
would
you
look
at
that
he's
all
over
her
cordelia
looks
over
at
buffy
oz
and
willow
but
if
you
plot
ahead
psst
hey
buddy
this
is
a
public
forum
here
cordelia
looks
back
at
him
as
do
buffy
oz
and
willow
then
you
can
turn
that
advantage
to
yourself
i
think
you
splashed
on
just
a
little
too
much
'obsession
for
dorks'
by
being
prepared
you
have
the
power
okay
everyone
get
into
your
assigned
groups
the
students
all
get
up
from
the
bleachers
and
go
down
to
the
floor
larry
takes
off
his
sweat
jacket
and
goes
to
the
table
in
front
of
them
to
check
which
group
he's
in
xander
sees
his
arm
all
wrapped
up
in
a
bandage
just
above
the
elbow
what
happened
oh
last
week
some
huge
dog
jumped
out
of
the
bushes
and
bit
me
thirtynine
stitches
they
oughta
shoot
those
strays
oz
next
to
larry
i've
been
there
man
oz
holds
up
his
finger
my
cousin
jordy
just
got
his
grownup
teeth
in
does
not
like
to
be
tickled
xander
laughs
larry
just
shakes
his
head
and
then
goes
over
to
theresa
who
is
doing
stretching
exercises
larry
into
her
ear
theresa
larry
she
straightens
up
be
still
my
shorts
we're
in
the
same
group
larry
chuckles
and
nods
i
may
have
to
attack
you
no
aaactually
i
think
uh
in
our
group
there
are
a
few
of
us
buffy
joins
theresa
and
i'm
one
of
the
few
willow
comes
up
behind
her
quickly
takes
her
arm
and
pulls
her
aside
buffy
keeps
her
eye
on
larry
another
moment
then
looks
at
willow
as
she
explains
don't
forget
you're
supposed
to
be
a
meek
little
girliegirl
like
the
rest
of
us
willow
walks
off
buffy
looks
at
larry
spoil
my
fun
cut
to
a
few
minutes
later
everyone
is
lined
up
and
paired
off
girls
in
front
boys
in
back
okay
everyone
listen
up
i
wanna
show
you
what
to
do
should
you
be
attacked
from
behind
coach
looks
at
buffy
in
this
situation
bend
forward
using
your
back
and
shoulders
coach
bends
her
over
to
demonstrate
to
flip
the
assailant
over
to
the
ground
the
other
girls
all
bend
over
too
the
boys
follow
larry's
lead
and
put
their
arms
around
the
girls'
necks
buffy
grabs
larry's
arm
and
pretends
at
a
few
attempts
to
flip
him
over
willow
gives
her
a
smile
and
nod
uhh
uhh
oh
summers
you
are
turning
me
on
he
grabs
her
butt
cheek
hard
with
his
other
hand
buffy
isn't
about
to
take
that
and
immediately
flips
him
over
hard
onto
the
mats
in
front
of
them
larry
groans
as
he
lies
there
willow
shoots
buffy
a
look
as
she
and
oz
stand
back
up
the
coach
looks
over
at
her
also
oz
points
that
works
too
cut
to
the
library
giles
is
demonstrating
the
phases
of
the
moon
using
a
large
earth
globe
with
a
smaller
moon
globe
attached
by
a
bar
and
uh
while
there's
absolutely
no
scientific
explanation
for
lunar
effect
on
the
human
psyche
uh
the
phases
of
the
moon
uh
do
seem
to
exert
a
great
deal
of
psychological
influence
and
ththe
full
moon
is
is
seems
to
bring
out
our
darkest
qualities
and
yet
ironically
uh
led
to
the
invention
of
the
moon
pie
giles
gets
the
joke
oh
giles
chuckles
yes
the
moon
pie
giles
laughs
harder
giles
gets
looks
from
buffy
and
willow
yyou
see
uh
thethe
werewolf
uh
is
such
a
a
potent
eeextreme
representation
of
our
inborn
animalistic
traits
that
it
eemerges
for
three
full
consecutive
nights
the
full
moon
and
uh
the
two
nights
surrounding
it
quite
the
party
animal
quite
and
it
uh
acts
onon
pure
instinct
no
conscience
uh
uh
predatory
and
and
aggressive
in
other
words
your
typical
male
on
behalf
of
my
gender
hey
yes
let's
not
jump
to
any
conclusions
i
didn't
jump
i
took
a
tiny
step
and
there
conclusions
were
the
point
is
that
our
wolfman
could
also
be
aaa
wolfwoman
or
or
anyone
who
was
bitten
by
a
werewolf
so
then
i'm
guessing
your
standard
silver
bullets
are
in
order
here
no
no
bullets
no
matter
who
this
werewolf
is
iit's
still
a
human
being
who
may
be
completely
unaware
of
his
or
her
condition
so
tonight
we
bring
'em
back
alive
cut
to
that
night
in
a
secluded
area
of
the
park
the
moon
is
full
and
several
cars
are
parked
there
with
couples
making
out
giles
walks
by
some
cars

ever
found
no
um
no
no
sign
of
the
werewolf
how
about
you
uh
the
same
giles
looks
around
i
thought
we
might
uh
i
thought
we
might
knock
on
a
few
windows
uh
ask
if
anyone
has
seen
anything
yet
buffy
gives
him
a
look
giles
no
one's

a
moment

then
heads
off
into
the
bushes
herself
cut
into
the
bushes
buffy
scans
around
with
her
flashlight
as
she
walks
into
a
small
clearing
suddenly
she
hears
a
noise
like
a
latch
releasing
and
yelps
as
she
finds
herself
being
pulled
up
in
a
net
trap
below
her
a
hunter
points
his
scoped
doublebarreled
flintlock
up
at
her
and

something
about
me
being
in
this
net
thing
cain
exhales
lowers
the
flintlock
and
leans
it
against
a
boulder
he
pulls
out
his
buckknife
and
cuts
the
rope
holding
up
the
net
it
falls
and
buffy
hits
the
ground
fairly
hard
giles
reaches
down
to
untangle
the
net
you
alright
yeah
buffy
gets
up
cain
sees
buffy
clearly
now
gotta
say
i'm
impressed
excuse
me
buffy
looks
up
at
giles
then
back
at
cain
well
it's
good
to
get
the
fruit
while
it's
fresh
you'd
be
wise
to
take
that
back
hey
what
a
man
and
a
girl
do
in
lovers'
lane
at
night
is
nobody's
busi
giles
makes
a
move
toward
cain
but
buffy
holds
him
back
oh
okay
hey
enough
repulsive
brain
it's
not
what
you
think
buffy
looks
at
giles
we're
hunting
werewolves
cain
laughs
okay
it's
funny
if
you
don't
believe
in
werewolves
no
it's
funny
thinking
about
you
two
catching
one
i
mean
this
guy
looks
like
he's
auditioning
to
be
a
librarian
and
you
well
you're
a
girl
i
assure
you
she's
quite
capable
uhhuh
lemme
ask
you
something
sweetheart
exactly
how
many
of
these
animals
have
you
taken
out
as
of
today
i
tore
a
tooth
from
the
mouth
of
every
werewolf
that
i
killed
cain
holds
out
his
necklace
this
next
one
will
bring
the
total
to
an
even
dozen
so
you're
just
gonna
kill
it
well
see
that's
the
thing
their
pelts
fetch
a
pretty
penny
in
sri
lanka
and
it's
a
little
hard
to
skin
'em
when
they're
alive
yyou
hunt
werewolves
ffor
sport
no
no
i'm
in
it
purely
for
the
money
and
it
doesn't
bother
you
that
a
werewolf
is
a
person
twenty
eight
days
out
of
the
month
that's
why
i
only
hunt
'em
the
other
three
i'd
really
love
to
stay
and
chat
cain
crouches
down
to
collect
the
net
but
i'm
on
a
tight
schedule
any
idea
where
else
the
boys
and
girls
like
to
get
together
around
here
you're
looking
for
a
party
no
but
the
werewolf
is
they're
suckers
for
that
whole
sexual
heat
thing
sense
it
miles
away
since
this
little
doggie
ain't
here
i
guess
he
found
another
place
cain
stands
up
sorry
wish
i
could
help
you
but
you
don't
know
squat
cain
shakes
his
head
gee
what
a
surprise
cain
leaves
buffy
turns
and
heads
back
to
the
car
where
are
we
going
i
think
i
know
where
to
look
we
just
have
to
make
it
there
before
mein
furrier
cut
to
a
street
theresa
is
walking
home
she
passes
a
house
with
a
fenced
in
front
yard
overgrown
with
weeds
she
hears
some
rustling
and
stops
to
look
around
seeing
nothing
she
continues
cut
to
a
view
of
her
from
the
other
side
of
the
fence
the
camera
follows
behind
her
she
hears
more
rustling
and
stops
to
look
again
something
lets
out
a
low
growl
and
theresa
decides
it's
time
to
run
she
looks
back
again
and
doesn't
see
angelus
in
front
of
her
she
slams
into
him
and
screams
everything
okay
angelus
twirls
a
daisy
yeah
i
just
uh
i
i
thought
i
heard
something
behind
me
he
walks
around
her
to
have
a
look
then
turns
back
to
her
no
one
there
oh
i
guess
i
was
wrong
i
could
have
sworn
that
it's
okay
it
can
get
pretty
scary
out
here
all
alone
at
night
yeah
hey
don't
i
know
you
from
somewhere
don't
you
go
to
school
with
buffy
oh

know
buffy
theresa
smiles
angelus
chuckles
yes
i
do
very
well
theresa
keeps
smiling
oh
come
on
i'll
get
you
home
they
walk
off
together
taking
another
quick
look
behind
them
cut
to
the
bronze
lotion
is
the
band
tonight
they're
playing
blind
for
now
as
the
camera
pans
from
the
mirrors
on
the
far
wall
of
the
bronze
and
over
to
the
band
playing
on
the
stage
and
then
sweep
this
town
into
a
monster
truck
of
shame
carved
out
of
soap
and
steel
and
clay
and
salty
fame
you
are
the
first
to
look
away
and
against
me
you
shake
the
squirrel
out
your
tree
cut
to
cordelia
and
willow
sitting
on
opposite
sides
of
a
couch
by
a
low
table
i
mean
with
xander
it's
always
'buffy
did
this'
'willow
said
that'
buffy
buffy
willow
willow
it's
like
i
don't
even
exist
cordelia
leans
back
and
folds
her
arm
i
sometimes
feel
like
that
willow
looks
over
at
cordelia
and
then
when
i
call
him
on
it
he
acts
all
confused
like
i'm
the
one
with
the
problem
willow
nods
his
'do
i
smell
something'
look
all
a
part
of
his
little
guy
games
it's
like
he's
there
but
then
he's
not
there
and
he
wants
it
but
then
he
doesn't
want
it
he's
so
busy
looking
around
at
everything
he
doesn't
have
he
doesn't
even
realize
what
he
does
have
well
he
should
at
least
realize
that
you
have
oz
willow
frowns
and
raises
an
eyebrow
mm
i'm
not
sure
i
do
willow
confused
oz
and
i
are
in
some
sort
of
holding
pattern
except
without
the
holding
or
anything
else
what's
he
waiting
for
what's
his
problem
cordelia
rolls
her
eyes
oh
that's
right
he's
a
guy
willow
disgusted
yeah
him
and
xander
guys
who
do
they
think
they
are
a
couple
of
guys
suddenly
the
werewolf
drops
down
from
above
onto
the
table
in
front
of
them
they
both
scream
and
run
from
the
couch
in
opposite
directions
panic
sets
in
around
them
and
the
werewolf
just
stands
there
at
a
half
crouch
confused
by
all
the
noise
cut
outside
to
the
alley
giles
and
buffy
come
rolling
up
in
his
decrepit
car
as
patrons
flee
for
their
lives
looks
as
though
your
hunch
was
right
who
could
resist
sunnydale's
own
house
of
hormones
she
opens
the
door
and
gets
out
willow
sees
her
and
stops
the
werewolf
it's
in
there
buffy
makes
a
dash
for
the
door
as
it's
about
to
be
shut
by
the
bouncer
coming
through
she
rushes
through
the
door
cut
inside
the
door
is
closed
on
her
and
she
looks
back
at
it
as
it
slams
shut
with
a
thud
she
slowly
steps
into
the
main
area
and
looks
around
the
place
has
been
trashed
by
the
panicked
people
tables
and
chairs
are
lying
everywhere
spilled
drinks
are
splattered
on
the
floor
buffy
sees
a
shadow
behind
a
bead
curtain
and
makes
for
it
as
she
walks
she
takes
off
her
backpack
and
pulls
out
a
chain
cut
to
the
restroom
and
backstage
area
buffy
sees
the
bead
curtain
that
leads
to
the
stage
office
swinging
she
climbs
the
few
steps
and
goes
in
she
goes
through
another
door
to
the
stage
the
chain
is
wrapped
around
her
forearm
ready
to
use
against
the
werewolf
slowly
she
steps
out
onto
the
stage
when
she's
passed
the
drums
the
werewolf
comes
out
from
behind
the
stage
curtains
snarling
buffy
spins
around
to
face
it
and
drops
her
backpack
she
quickly
unravels
a
length
of
chain
from
her
arms
and
gets
ready
she
throws
the
chain
out
and
it
wraps
itself
perfectly
around
the
werewolf's
neck
it
begins
to
struggle
and
yanks
at
the
chain
pulling
buffy
into
and
over
the
drums
the
chain
falls
from
the
werewolf's
neck
and
it
makes
a
dash
for
a
window
cut
outside
the
window
the
werewolf
comes
crashing
through
and
out
into
the
alley
it
takes
a
quick
look
both
ways
and
runs
away
cut
to
later
the
bronze
employees
are
back
and
begin
to
straighten
things
up
buffy
puts
her
chain
back
into
her
backpack

up
and
puts
on
the
backpack
as
giles

follows
right
behind
cut
to
a
loading
dock
area
the
werewolf
walks
into
the
light
next
to
a
trailer
and
stops
to
sniff
the
air
it
looks
down
and
sees
a
large
splotch
of
blood
in
the
gutter
it
continues
along
the
side
of
the
trailer
when
it
reaches
the
far
end
theresa
falls
to
the
ground
from
behind
the
trailer
with
a
vampire
bite
clearly
visible
on
her
neck
the
werewolf
looks
down
at
her
but
doesn't
make
a
move
to
eat
her
on
the
other
side
of
her
angelus
steps
up
in
his
game
face
and
growls
at
the
werewolf
the
werewolf
bares
its
fangs
at
angelus
and
growls
more
loudly
angelus
returns
the
growl
baring
his
own
fangs
and
staring
the
werewolf
down
warning
him
away
from
theresa's
body
angelus
slowly
backs
away
and
leaves

down
at

growls
but
makes
no
move
to
touch
her

cut
to
a
view
of
sunnydale
from
atop
a
hill
the
sun
is
coming
up
in
the
distance
cut
to
the
werewolf
asleep
on
the
ground
in
the
woods
the
camera
pans
from
its
hind
paws
over
to
its
head
when
sunlight
hits
the
werewolf
it
morphs
back
into
its
human
form
oz
wakes
up
opens
his
eyes
and
looks
around
confused

sits
up

he
lowers
the
phone
and
turns
it
off
he
stares
off
into
space
as
the
new
knowledge
that
he
is
the
werewolf
sinks
in
cut
to
the
halls
at
sunnydale
high
oz
walks
slowly
among
the
other
students
as
he
makes
his
way
to
the
library
he
looks
down
and
around
at
everyone
still
trying
to
deal
with
this
new
revelation
about
himself
when
he
reaches
the
library
he
stares
at
the
door
for
a
long
moment
cut
inside
the
library
buffy
paces
willow
is
sitting
at
the
table
with
giles
behind
her
and
xander
is
leaning
against
the
counter
i
can't
believe
i
let
that
thing
get
away
cain
was
right
i
shoulda
killed
it
when
i
had
the
chance
oz
comes
in
and
has
overheard
that
last
comment
killed
what
uh
the
uh
buffy
ahem

werewolf
ititit
was
out
last
night

gladness
yeah
but
he
got
someone
theresa
'got'
as
in
buffy
just
looks
at
him
and
briefly
raises
her
eyebrows
oh
i'm
sorry

i
coulda
stopped
it
buffy
sits
well
we
we
have
one
more
night
another
night
oh
yeah
believe
me
i'm
gonna
give
that
wolfie
something
to
howl
about
hmm
xander
comes
over
but
while
we
hang
here
doing
nothing
there's
a
human
werewolf
walking
around
out
there
probably
making
fun
of
us
willow
with
a
hint
of
sarcasm
the
way
werewolves
always
do
but
there's
really
no
way
to
tell
who
it
is
oh
sure
there
is
giles
knows
stuff
and
i'm
practically
an
expert
on
the
subject
on
account
of
once
you
were
a
hyena
i
know
what
it's
like
to
crave
the
taste
of
freshly
killed
meat
to
be
taken
over
by
those
uncontrollable
urges
you
said
you
didn't
remember
anything
about
that
xander
chuckles
i
said
i
didn't
remember
anything
about
that
look
the
point
is
is
i
have
an
affinity
with
this
thing
i
can
get
inside
of
its
head
xander
closes
his
eyes
and
begins
to
be
the
werewolf
i'm
a
big
bad
wolf
i'm
on
the
prowl
xander
sniffs
i'm
sniffing
i'm
snarling
i'm
a
slobbering
predator
i'm
xander
opens
his
eyes
wait
a
second
it's
right
in
front
of
us
xander
oz's
eye
go
wide
with
the
fear
of
being
recognized
it's
obvious
who
i
am
i'm
larry
xander
oz
breathes
a
sigh
of
relief
the
guy's
practically
got
wolfboy
stamped
on
his
forehead
you
got
the
dog
bite
you
got
the
aggression
not
to
mention
the
excessive
back
hair
and
he
was
awfully
gleeful
about
tormenting
theresa
still
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
i'm
gonna
go
talk
to
him
gonna
force
a
confession
out
of
him
xander
leaves
good
go
uh
in
the
meantime
we
need
to
cover
our
bases

the
student
files

if
anybody
else
fits
the
profile

he
jogs
out
of
the
library
willow
watches
him
go
confused
about
his
behavior
buffy
looks
sadly
at
her
friend
from
the
office
doorway
cut
to
the
boys'
locker
room
the
camera
pans
over
to
the
sinks
where
larry
is
splashing
some
water
onto
his
face
he
grabs
a
towel
and
dries
off
as
he
heads
for
his
gym
locker
xander
is
there
waiting
for
him
and
kicks
his
locker
closed
to
get
his
attention
larry
takes
the
towel
from
his
face
and
looks
at
xander
startled
harris
sheesh
next
time
wear
a
bell
larry
opens
his
locker
why
so
jumpy
larry
geeks
make
me
nervous
is
that
really
it
or
is
there
something
you're
hiding
larry
leans
on
his
locker
door
i
could
hide
my
fist
in
your
face
i
know
your
secret
big
guy
i
know
what
you've
been
doing
at
night
you
know
harris
that
nosey
little
nose
of
yours
is
going
to
get
you
into
trouble
someday
larry
grabs
xander
by
the
shirt
like
today
hurting
me
isn't
gonna
make
this
go
away
people
are
still
gonna
find
out
larry
lets
go
alright
what
do
you
want
hush
money
is
that
what
you're
after
i
don't
want
anything
i
just
wanna
help
what
you
think
you
have
a
cure
no
it's
just
i
know
what
you're
going
through
because
i've
been
there
that's
why
i
know
you
should
talk
about
it
yeah
that's
easy
for
you
to
say
i
mean
you're
nobody
i've
got
a
reputation
here
larry
please
before
someone
else
gets
hurt
larry
points
at
xander's
chest
look
if
this
gets
out
it's
over
for
me
larry
turns
and
takes
a
few
paces
away
i
mean
forget
about
playing
football
they'll
run
me
outta
this
town
i
mean
come
on
how
are
people
going
to
look
at
me
larry
faces
xander
after
they
find
out
i'm
gay
xander
looks
at
him
in
astonishment
larry
looks
like
a
heavy
burden
has
just
been
lifted
and
smiles
oh
wow
i
said
it
and
it
felt
okay
larry
whispers
i'm
gay
larry
approaches
xander
i
am
gay
i
heard
you
the
first
time
i
can't
believe
it
it
was
almost
easy
i
never
felt
i
could
tell
anyone
larry
gestures
to
xander
and
then
you
you
of
all
people
you
bring
it
outta
me
it
probably
would
have
slipped
out
even
if
i
wasn't
here
larry
leans
on
his
locker
door
no
no
because
knowing
you
went
through
the
same
thing
made
it
easier
for
me
to
admit
it
xander
wideeyed
the
same
thing
larry
puts
his
arm
around
xander
it's
ironic
i
mean
all
those
times
i
beat
the
crap
out
of
you
it
musta
been
because
i
recognized
something
in
you
that
i
didn't
want
to
believe
about
myself
xander
laughs
nervously
larry
no
i
am
not
of
course
of
course
not
don't
worry
larry
pats
xander
on
the
shoulder
i
wouldn't
do
that
to
you
your
secret's
safe
with
me
he
gives
xander
a
thumbsup
and
smiles
larry
to
himself
wow
he
drapes
the
towel
around
his
neck
closes
his
gym
locker
and
walks
off
xander
stares
after
him
in
disbelief
cut
to
the
library
willow
is
'net
surfing
on
her
laptop
buffy
comes
out
of
giles'
office
and
goes
over
to
her
so
what's
the
scuttlebutt
anybody
besides
larry
fit
our
werewolf
profile
buffy
sits
on
the
table
there
is
one
name
that
keeps
getting
spit
out
aggressive
behavior
runins
with
authorities
about
a
screenful
of
violent
incidents
okay
most
of
those
were
not
my
fault
somebody
else
started
'em
i
was
just
standing
up
for
myself
willow
looks
up
at
buffy
they
say
it's
a
good
idea
to
count
to
ten
when
you're
angry
one
two
three
willow
looks
back
at
her
laptop
i'll
keep
looking
willow
goes
back
to
work
i
um
noticed
you
were
looking
solo
yeah
oz
wanted
to
be
someplace
that
was
willow
looks
up
at
buffy
away
from
me
i'm
sorry
willow
leans
back
in
her
chair
i
can't
figure
him
out
i
mean
he's
so
hot
and
cold
or
lukewarm
and
cold
welcome
to
the
mystery
that
is
men
i
think
it
goes
something
like
they
grow
body
hair
they
lose
all
ability
to
tell
you
what
they
really
want
it
doesn't
seem
like
a
fair
trade
willow
stands
up
and
puts
her
laptop
in
its
case
well
if
you
wanna
up
the
speed
quotient
with
oz
maybe
you
need
to
do
something
daring
maybe
you
need
to
make
the
first
move
she
slides
off
of
the
table
and
willow
follows
her
as
she
gets
her
stuff
for
class
well
that
won't
make
me
a
slut
i
think
your
reputation
will
remain
intact
cut
to
the
hall
willow
and
buffy
come
out
of
the
library
it
used
to
be
so
much
easier
to
tell
if
a
boy
liked
you
he'd
punch
you
on
the
arm
and
then
run
back
to
his
friends
those
were
the
days
xander
comes
up
to
them
hey
they
stop
he
taps
buffy
on
the
arm
she
looks
up
at
him
i'll
see
you
guys
later
willow
buffy
looks
at
her
cordelia
asked
me
to
look
over
her
history
homework
before
class
i
think
that
means
i
might
have
to
do
it
willow
goes
off
wow
those
two
gals
are
hanging
out
a
lot
together
this
would
be
a
good
time
to
panic
buffy
lets
out
a
laugh
they
start
down
the
hall
so
how'd
it
go
with
larry
what's
that
supposed
to
mean
i
think
it's
supposed
to
mean
'so
how'd
it
go
with
larry'
she
stops
at
her
locker
and
reaches
for
the
combination
lock
he's
not
the
werewolf
can't
we
just
leave
it
at
that
must
you
continue
to
push
and
push
buffy
opens
her
locker
i'm
sorry
i
was
just
wondering
buffy
takes
off
her
pack
well
he's
not
okay
okay
but
there
goes
our
lead
suspect
buffy
sticks
her
pack
in
her
locker
which
then
puts
us
right
back
at
closes
the
locker
square
boned
you're
not
boned
you're
buffy
eradicator
of
evil
defender
of
um
things
that
need
defending
tell
that
to
theresa
she
could
have
used
my
defending
before
she
was
ripped
apart
by
that
buffy
stops
and
considers
werewolf
nowhere
in
any
of
the
reports
did
it
say
anything
about
her
being
mauled
buffy
looks
up
at
xander
i
mean
they
were
linked
to
the
animal
attacks
from
the
other
night
so
we
just
assumed
werewolf
what
else
should
we
have
assumed
cut
to
the
funeral
home
theresa
is
laid
out
in
her
coffin
with
a
scarf
around
her
neck
buffy
pulls
it
back
and
sees
the
bite
vampire
so
that's
good
right
i
mean
in
the
sense
of
the
werewolf
didn't
get
her
and
xander
gets
a
look
from
buffy
no
there
is
no
good
here
no
good
instead
of
not
protecting
theresa
from
the
werewolf
buffy
goes
over
to
the
guest
register
i
was
able
to
not
protect
her
from
something
just
as
bad
buffy
looks
at
all
the
signatures
she
had
a
lot
of
friends
buffy
takes
the
pen
to
add
her
own
buffy
you
can't
blame
yourself
for
every
death
that
happens
in
sunnydale
if
it
weren't
for
you
people'd
be
lined
up
five
deep
waitin'
to
get
themselves
buried
willow
would
be
robbie
the
robot's
love
slave
i
wouldn't
even
have
a
head
xander
looks
at
the
coffin
and
theresa's
a
vampire
theresa
sits
up
looks
over
at
them
and
growls
buffy
turns
around
and
sees
her
hop
out
of
the
coffin
she
lunges
at
theresa
grabs
her
and
tries
to
wrestle
her
to
the
floor
but
theresa
throws
her
down
instead
she
dives
after
buffy
and
tries
to
pin
her
but
buffy
rolls
her
over
and
gets
on
top
she
makes
a
quick
grab
for
a
wooden
easel
holding
a
flower
wreath
and
breaks
off
a
leg
she's
about
to
thrust
it
into
theresa's
chest
when
she
speaks
angel
sends
his
love
buffy
is
caught
off
guard
by
that
and
hesitates
a
moment
theresa
kicks
buffy's
arm
and
sends
the
stick
flying
away
she
grabs
buffy
by
the
shoulders
wrestles
her
onto
her
back
and
pins
her
buffy
struggles
to
keep
her
at
bay
behind
her
xander
has
grabbed
the
easel
and
jams
one
of
its
legs
through
theresa's
back
she
bursts
into
ashes
buffy
stares
up
at
xander
he
tosses
the
easel
aside
and
looks
down
at
her
buffy
looks
aside
sadly
and
then
rolls
over
buffy
to
herself
angel
buffy
gets
to
her
knees
xander
leans
down
to
her
are
you
okay
buffy
takes
his
hand
this
isn't
happening
buffy
pulls
herself
up
and
hugs
xander
he's
gonna
keep
coming
after
me
xander
hugs
back
gently
don't
let
him
get
to
you
he's
not
the
same
guy
you
knew
she
pulls
back
a
bit
and
looks
up
at
him
he
looks
back
kindly
she
lets
go
picks
up
her
backpack
and
goes
out
xander
stares
after
her
oh
no
my
life's
not
too
complicated
he
shakes
his
head
and
follows
her
out
cut
to
the
woods
cain's
van
is
parked
with
the
curtains
drawn
across
the
cab
cut
inside
the
van
it's
set
up
like
a
small
hunter's
lodge
with
hunting
equipment
and
traps
hanging
from
the
walls
and
a
lab
bench
full
of
reloading
equipment
he
reaches
down
picks
up
a
small
iron
pan
and
sets
it
on
the
bench
he
has
a
bunsen
burner
going
he
takes
a
small
longhandled
melting
cup
and
holds
it
over
the
flame
when
the
metal
in
the
cup
has
become
molten
he
brings
it
over
to
a
mold
that
he's
holding
over
the
iron
pan
with
his
other
hand
and
pours
the
silver
into
it
he
sets
the
melting
cup
aside
and
breaks
open
the
mold
inside
is
a
perfectly
formed
bullet
he
holds
it
up
to
inspect
it
in
the
dim
light
cut
to
a
shot
of
the
full
moon
rising
cut
to
oz's
dining
room
he
has
a
box
full
of
shackles
and
locks
and
dumps
them
out
he
looks
at
them
and
considers
a
moment
then
with
a
strengthened
resolve
starts
to
put
one
on
he's
about
to
put
the
lock
on
when
there's
a
knocking
at
the
door
he
ignores
it
and
looks
at
the
lock
as
he
moves
to
put
it
on
there's
another
knock
on
the
door
he
looks
at
it
in
frustration
and
sets
the
lock
and
shackles
down
the
knocking
continues
insistently
as
he
goes
over
to
the
door
when
he
opens
it
he
finds
an
irate
willow
standing
there
ready
to
knock
even
more
willow
what
are
you
doing
she
pushes
her
way
inside
i
had
this
whole
thing
worked
out
willow
goes
toward
the
dining
room
and
i
had
it
written
down
uh
but
then
it
didn't
make
any
sense
willow
turns
to
face
him
when
i
was
reading
it
back
willow
this
is
not
a
very
good
time
i
mean
what
am
i
supposed
to
think
first
you
buy
me
popcorn
willow
paces
away
and
then
you're
all
glad
that
i
didn't
get
bit
willow
paces
back
willow
softly
and
you
put
the
tag
back
in
my
shirt
willow
harshly
but
i
guess
none
of
that
means
anything
because
instead
of
looking
up
names
with
me
here
you
are
all
alone
in
your
house
doing
nothing
by
yourself
willow
we'll
talk
about
this
tomorrow
i
promise
he
tries
to
take
hold
of
her
to
lead
her
out
but
she
shakes
him
off
no
damn
it
we'll
talk
about
this
now
buffy
told
me
that
sometimes
what
a
girl
makes
has
to
be
the
first
move
and
now
that
i'm
saying
this
i'm
starting
to
think
that
the
written
version
sounded
pretty
good
but
you
know
what
i
mean
i
know
i
know
it's
me
i'm
i'm
goin'
through
some
changes
well
welcome
to
the
world
things
happen
don't
you
think
i'm
going
through
a
lot
not
like
me
oh
what
so
now
you're
special
willow
paces
away
into
the
dining
room
you're
special
boy
willow
sees
the
shackles
with
chains
and
stuff
why
do
you
have
chains
and
stuff
oz
doubles
over
in
pain
and
hugs
his
chest
willow
please
oz
heads
for
the
door
get
outta
here
she
stares
at
him
confused
he
falls
behind
the
couch
out
of
her
view
there
he
begins
to
rapidly
grow
hair
and
mutate
into
a
werewolf
oz
oz
what
is
it
she
slowly
approaches
the
couch
oz's
fingers
grow
longer
and
hairier
what's
wrong
she
hears
oz
moaning
in
pain
she
looks
carefully
over
the
couch
and
oz
the
werewolf
leaps
to
his
feet
and
growls
at
her
she
screams
and
jumps
backward
away
from
him
part
4

oz's
living
room
willow
screams
and
starts
to
run
through
the
dining
room
oz
the
werewolf
gives
chase
she
runs
down
the
hall
and
out
a
back
door
cut
to
the
streets
willow
runs
the
werewolf
comes
around
the
corner
chasing
after
her
she
goes
up
to
a
wooden
fence
hops
up
and
tries
to
pull
herself
over
she's
not
quite
fast
enough
and
only
has
one
leg
over
when
the
werewolf
catches
up
it
makes
a
grab
for
her
leg
but
misses
as
she
drops
over
the
other
side
and
manages
to
land
in
a
crouch
on
her
feet
she
sees
a
couple
of
metal
trashcans
there
grabs
one
and
smashes
it
into
the
werewolf's
face
as
it
tries
to
climb
over
after
her
cut
to
the
street
cain's
van
rolls
slowly
along
he
looks
up
and
sees
the
werewolf
trying
to
get
over
the
fence
there
you
are
he
pulls
the
van
over
to
the
side
cut
to
the
library
giles
opens
a
guncase
undoes
the
straps
and
pulls
out
the
stock
he
grabs
the
barrel
and
scope
assembly
and
clicks
them
into
place
buffy
comes
walking
up
behind
him
sorry
i'm
late
i
had
to
do
some
unscheduled
slayage
in
the
form
of
theresa
he
stops
his
assembling
to
look
at
her
she's
a
vampire
was
angel
sent
her
to
me
a
little
token
of
his
affection
buffy
i'm
so
sorry
buffy
holds
up
her
hand
not
now
giles
we
can
all
have
ourselves
a
good
cry
after
we
bag
us
a
werewolf
he
plugs
in
the
laser
sight
and
holds
the
tranquilizer
gun
up
to
check
the
scope
cut
to
the
woods
willow
runs
quickly
through
the
trees
with
the
werewolf
not
far
behind
she
hops
over
a
log
but
then
trips
and
falls
to
the
ground
she
rolls
to
face
the
werewolf
and
looks
at
it
in
terror
it
doesn't
attack
but
instead
sniffs
the
air
it
looks
around
for
the
direction
of
the
scent
and
rushes
off
willow
quickly
gets
to

willow

yeah
he's
a
werewolf
but
he
doesn't
mean
to
be
don't
worry
willow
we're
not
going
to
hurt
him
they
all
start
out
of
the
library
i
put
enough
phenobarbital
in
this
thing
to
sink
a
small
elephant
it
should
be
enough
for
a
large
werewolf
he
grabs
his
coat
from
the
counter
and
holds
the
door
open
for
the
girls
cut
to
the
woods
the
werewolf
has
found
what
it's
looking
for
so
has
cain
and
he
cocks
his
flintlock's
hammer
back
and
lifts
it
to
his
shoulder
the
werewolf
gets
closer
to
the
pile
of
meat
cain
has
left
out
for
him
that's
it
let
me
see
you
come
on
suppertime
the
werewolf
is
on
top
of
the
bait
now
and
cain
takes
aim
good
doggy
now
play
dead
he
is
about
to
pull
he
trigger
when
he
gets
kicked
from
the
side
he
falls
to
the
ground
and
his
gun
fires
wild
the
werewolf
looks
up
from
its
meal
at
the
commotion
buffy
grabs
cain's
gun
and
wrestles
him
for
it
she
flips
the
rifle
over
and
he
follows
landing
on
his
back
and
letting
go
of
the
gun
in
the
process
as
he
tries
to
get
up
buffy
swings
the
butt
of
the
rifle
around
and
knocks
him
down
and
out
the
werewolf
comes
at
her
and
she
ducks
his
lunge
giles
and
willow
arrive
to
see
the
werewolf
grab
buffy
and
lift
her
off
of
her
feet
she
pushes
him
back
using
cain's
gun
to
keep
from
being
bitten
giles
tries
to
get
a
clear
shot
but
the
werewolf
turns
and
holds
buffy
up
between
them
careful
giles
can't
get
a
shot
damn
it
he
keeps
looking
for
an
opening
but
is
quickly
getting
frustrated
buffy
raises
the
rifle
high
and
smashes
it
down
on
the
werewolf's
head
it
drops
her
and
falls
back
stunned
it
quickly
gets
up
and
swipes
at
her
knocking
the
gun
from
her
hands
then
the
werewolf
shoves
buffy
away
and
right
into
giles
and
willow
bowling
them
over
it
starts
to
come
at
them
willow
scrambles
for
the
tranquilizer
gun
and
brings
it
up
to
bear
the
werewolf
charges
and
willow
pulls
the
trigger
the
dart
hits
it
in
the
chest
and
it
staggers
backward
a
bit
before
falling
over
unconscious
willow
looks
up
at
giles
i
shot
oz
you
saved
us
he
takes
the
gun
from
willow
buffy
walks
over
to
get
cain's
gun
he
gets
to
his
feet
and
straightens
his
coat
no
wonder
this
town's
overrun
with
monsters
no
one
here's
man
enough
to
kill
'em
oh
i
wouldn't
be
too
sure
of
that
cain
turns
to
see
her
with
his
flintlock
she
grabs
the
end
of
the
barrel
and
bends
it
into
a
nice
arc
right
in
front
of
him
and
then
thrusts
it
at
him
he
looks
at
her
in
astonishment
how
about
you
let
the
door
hit
you
in
the
ass
on
the
way
out
of
town
cain
makes
a
move
to
go
but
stops
to
give
her
another
look
she
stares
back
at
him
and
then
he
leaves
she
looks
down
at
willow
crouched
next
to
oz
the
werewolf
and
gets
down
with
her
you
think
it'll
be
okay
they
both
look
up
at
giles
he'll
be
a
little
sore
in
the
morning
but
he'll
be
oz
cut
to
sunnydale
high
the
next
day
cut
to
the
halls
xander
and
buffy
walk
past
the
trophy
case
and
into
the
lounge
this
is
all
so
weird
i
mean
how
are
we
supposed
to
act
when
we
see
him
well
it's
gotta
be
weird
for
him
too
now
that
we
know
so
much
all
i
know
is
i'll
never
be
able
to
look
at
him
the
same
again
he's
still
a
human
being
most
of
the
time
they
stop
at
the
vending
machine
who
are
we
talking
about
oz
who
are
you
talking
about
no
one
he
sees
larry's
jock
friends
by
the
stairs
knocking
a
girl's
books
out
of
her
hands
and
laughing
larry
comes
down
the
stairs
behind
her
and
quickly
reaches
down
to
help
her
pick
up
her
books
hey
let
me
get
those
thanks
his
friends
give
him
a
surprised
look
so
does
buffy
larry
comes
over
to
them
hey
xander
look
about
what
you
did
i
i
owe
you
what'd
you
do
it's
really
nothing
we
should
be
talking
about
xander
to
larry
ever
i
know
i
know
it's
just
well
larry
pats
him
on
the
arm
thanks
larry
walks
off
that
was
weird
they
go
to
a
table
and
sit
what
it's
not
okay
for
one
guy
to
like
another
guy
just
because
he
happened
to
be
in
the
locker
room
with
him
when
absolutely
nothing
happened
and
i
thought
i
told
you
not
to
push
all
i
meant
is
that
he
didn't
try
to
look
up
my
skirt
xander
fidgets
with
is
hands
oh
oh
yeah
that's
that's
the
weirdness
xander
smiles
nervously
weirdness
abounds
lately
maybe
it's
the
moon
that
does
stuff
to
people
i've
heard
that
buffy
sees
willow
walk
by
certainly
gonna
put
a
strain
on
willow
and
oz's
relationship
what
relationship
i
mean
what
life
could
they
possibly
have
together
xander
counts
off
on
his
fingers
we're
talking
obedience
school
paper
training
oz
is
always
in
back
burying
their
things
and
that
kind
of
breed
can
turn
on
its
owner
i
don't
know
i
kinda
see
oz
as
the
loyal
type
all
i'm
saying
is
she's
not
safe
with
him
if
it
were
up
to
me
buffy
interrupts
xander
cut
outside
to
willow
walking
over
to
oz
sitting
on
a
table
it's
not
up
to
you
hey
hey
did
you
want
to
go
first
i
spoke
to
giles
he
said
i'll
be
okay
i
just
have
to
lock
myself
up
around
the
full
moon
only
he
used
more
words
than
that
and
a
globe
i'm
sorry
about
how
all
this
ended
up
with
me
shooting
you
and
all
it's
okay
i'm
i'm
sorry
i
almost
ate
you
it's
okay
i
kind
of
thought
you
would
have
told
me
i
didn't
know
what
to
say
i
mean
it's
not
everyday
you
find
out
you're
a
werewolf
that's
fairly
freaksome
it
may
take
a
couple
days
getting
used
to
yeah
it's
a
complication
so
oz
hops
off
of
the
table
and
they
walk
maybe
it'd
be
best
if
i
just
sorta
what
well
you
know
like
stayed
out
of
your
way
for
awhile
i
don't
know
i'm
kind
of
okay
with
you
being
in
my
way
oz
stops
and
faces
her
you
mean
you'd
still
well
i
like
you
you're
nice
and
you're
funny
and
you
don't
smoke
yeah
okay
werewolf
but
that's
not
all
the
time
i
mean
three
days
out
of
the
month
i'm
not
much
fun
to
be
around
either
you
are
quite
the
human
willow
smiles
so
i'd
still
if
you'd
still
i'd
still
i'd
very
still
willow
smiles
widely
okay
willow
more
seriously
no
biting
though
agreed
willow
walks
off
with
a
smile
on
her
face
oz
turns
around
and
watches
her
go
he
smiles
then
he
looks
surprised
to
see
her
rushing
back
she
looks
at
him
for
an
instant
and
then
plants
a
kiss
right
on
his
lips
he
watches
her
with
a
smile
as
she
goes
off
again
a
werewolf
in
love
