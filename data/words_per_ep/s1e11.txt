discussing
'the
merchant
of
venice'
'if
you
prick
us
do
we
not
bleed
if
you
tickle
us
do
we
not
laugh
if
you
poison
us
do
we

if

wrong
us
shall
we
not
revenge'
ms
miller
looks
at
the
class
okay
so
talk
to
me
people
how
does
what
shylock
says
here
about
being
a
jew
relate
to
our
discussion
about
the
anger
of
the
outcast
in
society
well
how
about
color
me
totally
selfinvolved
care
to
elaborate
yeah
with
shylock
it's
whine
whine
whine
like
the
whole
world
is
about
him
he
acts
like
it's
justice
him
getting
a
pound
of
antonio's
flesh
it's
not
justice
it's
yicky
but
has
shylock
suffered
what's
his
place
in
venice
society
well
everyone
looked
down
on
him
that
is
such
a
twinkie
defense
shylock
should
get
over
himself
people
who
think
their
problems
are
so
huge
craze
me
like
this
time
i
sort
of
ran
over
this
girl
on
her
bike
it
was
the
most
traumatizing
event
of
my
life
and
she's
trying
to
make
it
about
her
leg
like
my
pain
meant
nothing
well
cordelia's
raised
an
interesting
point
here
ms
miller
the
bell
rings
which
we'll
pursue
at
a
later
time
the
students
get
up
to
leave
cordelia
comes
up
to
ms
miller's
desk
ms

actually
done
the
reading
willow
rolls
her
eyes
behind
cordelia
and
leaves

wanna
talk

a
shot
of
mitch
approaching
from
the
other

be
heard
and
then
a
girl's
giggling
mitch
hears
it
and
looks
around

there
he
doesn't
see
anyone
so
he
continues
getting
dressed

hears
the
giggling
again
and
looks
behind
him
where
he
thinks
it's
coming
from
okay

time's
over

reaches
for
a
bat
on
top
of
the
lockers

and
hits
him

and
hits
the
locker
doors

hits
him
on

sorry
willow
calms
down
it's
just
that
we
had
this
uh
you
had
to
be
there
it's
not
even
funny
really
uh
cordelia
just
has
a
history
of
trying
too
hard
yeah
what
kind
of
moron
would
wanna
be
may

buffy
turns
to
her
locker
i

kind
of
moron

the
uh
nonmoron
i
mean
buffy
closes
her
locker
and
turns
back
well
we
didn't
call
it
'may
queen'
but
we
had
the
coronation
and
the
dance
and
all
that
stuff
it
was
nice
well
you
know
you
don't
need
that
anymore
you
got
us
willow
cracks
up
again
be
my
deputy
oh
god
buffy
feels
very
left
out
suddenly
bud
comes
running
down
the
hall
with
news
about
mitch
guys
c'mon
bud
buffy
looks
up
mitch
got
whaled
on
i
think
he's
cut
to
the
door
to
the
gym
principal
snyder
is
talking
to
the
students
dead
of
course
not
what
are
you
ghouls
they
all
turn
to
look
when
the
paramedics
open
the
doors
to
the
gym
and
wheel
mitch
out
there
are
no
dead
students
here
this
week
clear
back
make
room
all
of
you
buffy
grabs
the
gurney
and
stops
it
mitch
what
happened
i
don't
know
i
i
heard
something
i
tried
to
grab
a
a
bat
mitch
guffaws
unable
to
believe
what
he's
saying
that
hit
me
what
hit
you
the
bat
by
itself
the
thing
was
floating
it
knocked
me
out
the
paramedics
wheel
him
away
buffy
to
xander
i'd
better
check
out
the
scene
buffy
starts
toward
the
locker
room
where
do
you
think
you're
going
buffy
stops
and
faces
him
um
mitch
wanted
me
to
get
his
comb
he
he
likes
his
comb
i
don't
think
mitch
needs
his
comb
right
now
i
think
mitch
needs
medical
attention
willow
and
xander
exchange
a
look
and
you
need
to
stay
away
from
the
crime
scene
always
sticking
your
nose
in
willow
loudly
sue
what
did
you
say
mitch
was
gonna
sue
the
school
snyder
diverted
by
willow
sue
who
buffy
mouths
a
'thank
you'
to
willow
and
xander
and
quickly
goes
onto
the
locker
room
well
his
dad
is
the
most
powerful
lawyer
in
sunnydale
hold
on
what
have
you
two
heard
his
dad
the
lawyer
you
haven't
heard
of
him
other
lawyers
call
him
'the
beast'
cut
to
the
locker
room
it's
deserted
buffy
walks
quietly
and
looks
around
she
sees
the
bat
on
the
floor
and
goes
over
to
it
she
nudges
it
with
her
foot
and
it
just
rolls
away
she
goes
into
the
nearest
row
of
lockers
where
four
of
the
locker
doors
are
damaged
and
wide
open
she
looks
into
one
of
the
lockers
and
notices
a
large
letter
on
the
door
next
to
it
she
closes
all
the
lockers
and
sees
the
word
'look'
painted
in
red
cut
to
later
in
the
cafeteria
during
lunch
'look'
that's
all
it
said
look
at
what
look
at
mitch
maybe
all
i
know
is
it's
a
message
and
giles
finds
them
ah
here
you
are
and
monsters
don't
usually
send
messages
it's
pretty
much
crush
kill
destroy
this
was
different
i'd
have
to
say
you're
right
i
love
it
when
he
says
that
any
theories
giles
takes
a
seat
uh
i'm
uh
it's
a
bit
of
a
puzzle
really
um
i've
never
actually
heard
of
anyone
attacked
by
a
lone
baseball
bat
before
maybe
it's
a
vampire
bat
xander
no
response
from
the
others
i'm
alone
with
that
one
huh
well
assuming
the
bat
itself
is
not
possessed
uh
there
are
a
few
possibilities
that
bear
investigating
uh
someone
with
telekinesis
uh
the
power
to
move
objects
at
will
uh
uh
an
invisible
creature
um
or
possibly
a
poltergeist
a
ghost
yes
and
a
very
angry
one
yeah
i'd
say
the
locker
room
was
a
real
scene
if
it's
a
ghost
then
we're
talking
about
a
dead
kid
i
guess
so
you
know
why
don't
you
compile
a
list
of
dead
or
missing
kids
it's
probably
a
good
place
to
start
and
uh
i'll
research
all
the
possibilities
ghosts
included
but
uh
xander
if
you're
not
doing
anything
would
you
like
to
help
me
what
so
there's
homework
now
when
did
that
happen
it's
all
part
of
the
glamorous
world
of
vampire
slayage
well
what
part
do
you
have
gonna
find
out
what
i
can
about
mitch
this
attack
wasn't
random
well
i
want
that
part
fine
you
can
do
it
ask
around
talk
to
his
friends

to
cordelia
talk

she
just

all
by
herself
no
i
was
pushed
buffy
gets
up
when
she
hears
laughter
and
footsteps
going
up
the
stairs
she
follows
the
sounds
up
the
stairs
snyder
bends
down
and
touches
harmony's
ankle
ow
don't
sue
buffy
reaches
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
still
hears
the
laughter
she
sees
a
door
close
and
follows
whoever
it
was
in
cut
to
inside
is
anybody
here
she
feels
something
bump
her
and
hears
footsteps
going
into
the
band
room
she
looks
around
confused
hey
who's
here
she
goes
into
the
band
room
and
hears
activity
somewhere
the
ceiling
access
hatch
in
the
corner
rises
up
but
buffy
doesn't
notice
it
okay
i
know
someone's
here
look
i'm
not
gonna
hurt
you
i
just
wanna
talk
to
you
the
ceiling
hatch
lowers
back
into
place
buffy
looks
around
and
finally
leaves
the
camera
pans
from
buffy
up
to
the
ceiling
hatch
in
a
corner
above
a
cabinet
part
2

the
main
entrance
to
sunnydale
high
after
school
students
are
leaving
for
the
day
the
camera
pans
over
to
two
men
dressed
in
black
suits
watching
the
student's
activity
giles
have
you
ever
touched
a
ghost
uh
no
from
what
i've
heard
uh
having
a
a
ghost
pass
through
you
is
a
singular
experience
it's
a
it's
a
rather
uh
cold
amorphous
feeling
it
makes
your
hair
stand
on
end
you
see
that's
my
problem
i
touched
the
thing
but
it
didn't
go
through
me
it
bumped
into
me
and
it
wasn't
cold
so
we're
talking
about
what
an
invisible
person
a
girl
she
laughed
a
girl
on
campus
with
the
ability
to
become
invisible
that
is
so
cool
cool
well
yeah
i
would
give
anything
to
be
able
to
turn
invisible
well
i
wouldn't
use
my
powers
to
beat
people
up
but
i'd
use
my
powers
to
protect
the
girls'
locker
room
it
must
be
a
fairly
heady
experience
having
that
ability
how'd
she
get
it
is
she
a
witch
'cause
we
can
fight
a
witch
hmm
greek
myths
speak
of
cloaks
of
invisibility
but
they're
usually
for
the
gods
xander
gets
looks
from
everyone
research
boy
comes
through
with
the
knowledge
this
girl's
sorta
petty
for
a
god
she's
got
a
grudge
but
why
harmony
harmony
and
mitch
the
common
denominator
is
cordelia
so
what
now
first
thing
tomorrow
why
don't
you
pull
up
that
missing
kids
list
got
it
i'll
see
ya
then
bye
see
ya
xander
leaves
with
willow
oh
hey
do
you
wanna
come
to
our
place
tonight

making
her
famous
phone
call
to
the
chinese
place
xander

you
guys

invisible

hunt
someone
you
can't

buffy
gives
giles
an
inquisitive
look
cut
to
the
halls
that
night
the
shadow
on
the
floor
shows
the
doors
opening
you
may
have
to
work
on
listening
to
people
very
funny
i
thought
so
buffy
comes
into
the
hall
and
hears
activity
to
her
left
she
finds
the
room
where
cordelia
and
her
friends
are
getting
her
dress
ready
they
fuss
over
the
dress
buffy
hears
the
conversation
and
laughter
coming
from
the
room
should
i
wear
my
hair
up
do
you
think
i
should
wear
it
up
buffy
peeks
through
the
door
to
watch
how
does
the
um
hem
go
is
it
is
it
long
enough
or
buffy
smiles
isn't
it
beautiful
buffy
looks
down
and
remembers
her
own
experience
as
prom
queen
as
she
turns
to
go
she
hears
a
flute
playing
she
begins
to
follow
the
sound
cut
to
the
library
giles
comes
up
the
stairs
and
stops
when
he
hears
the
music
too
the
music
stops
and
he
continues
into
the
stacks
he
hears
a
squeaking
and
stops
again
who's
there
after
a
moment
he
takes
a
few
steps
to
a
glassenclosed
bookcase
and
sees
his
reflection
he
turns
away
and
is
startled
by
angel
standing
there
he
looks
back
at
his
reflection
but
doesn't
see
one
for
angel
giles
exhales
a
vampire
casts
no
reflection
don't
worry
i'm
not
here
to
eat
buffy
told
me
you
don't
feed
from
humans
anymore
not
for
a
long
while
is
that
why
you're
here
to
see
her
i
can't
it's
uh
it's
too
hard
for
me
to
be
around
her
a
vampire
in
love
with
a
slayer
it's
rather
poetic
in
a
maudlin
sort
of
way
what
can
i
uh
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
know
you've
been
researching
the
master
yes
the
vampire
king
i've
tried
to
learn
as
much
as
i
can
about
him
for
the
day
that
buffy
must
face
him
something's
already
in
motion
something
big
but
i
don't
know
what
you've
read
all
the
slayer
lore
there
is
right
ii've
studied
all
the
extant
volumes
of
course
but
the
uh
most
salient
books
of
slayer
prophecy
have
been
lost
the
tiberius
manifesto
the
pergamum
codex
the
codex
it's
reputed
to
have
contained
the
most
complete
prophecies
about
the
slayer's
role
in
the
end
years
unfortunately
the
book
was
lost
in
the
15th
century
not
lost
misplaced
i
can
get
it
giles
exhales
astounded
that
would
be
most
helpful
uh
mmy
own
volumes
have
been
rather
useless
of
late
angel
looks
at
giles'
book
legends
of
vishnu
giles
a
bit
embarrassed
there's
an
invisible
girl
terrorizing
the
school
that's
not
really
my
area
of
expertise
nor
mine
i'm
afraid
uh
it's
fascinating
though
by
all
accounts
it's
a
a
a
wonderful
power
to
possess
oh
i
don't
know
looking
in
the
mirror
every
day
and
seeing
nothing
there
angel
cut
to
giles'
reflection
it's
an
overrated
pleasure
cut
to
a
girls'
restroom
marcie
is
having
another
flashback
she
looks
at
herself
in
the
mirror
cordelia
and
her

cabbage

those
slides

a
mountain

now
look
at
some
mountains'
harmony

three
slides
and
just
used
them
over
and
over
i
know

into
a
chair
she
notices
a
boot
print
on
it
guesses
it
was
used
as
a
step
to
climb
and
looks
up
she
notices
in
the
corner
of
the
ceiling
that
there's
an
access
hatch
she
climbs
up
onto
the
cabinet
and
crawls
over
to
the
hatch
she
lifts
it
up
and
puts
it
aside
as
she
pokes
her
head
in
and
has
a
look
around
she
climbs
up
onto
the
ceiling
and
begins
to
crawl
through
the
space
near
a
skylight
she
finds
marcie's
things
her
flute
is
there
and
buffy
picks
it
up
to
look
at
it
the
camera
shows
marcie's
view
as
she
watches
buffy
go
through
her
stuff
buffy
picks
up
her
teddy

at
it
and
puts
it
back

looks
under
some
sheet
music

marcie's
yearbook
pulls
it
out
and
opens
it
marcie
ross
so
it
is
you
as
buffy
sits
there
and
reflects
a
knife
floats
in
midair
behind
her
left
shoulder
buffy
closes
the
yearbook
and
takes
it
with
her
as
she
starts
back
to
the

she
closes
the

she
looks
up
from
her
desk
and
sees
no
one's
there
she
goes
back
to
her
work
as

walks
around

the
library
giles
is
sitting
at
the
table
a
nest
it
looked
like
she'd
been
there
for
months
it's
where
i
found
this
she
opens
the
yearbook
and
puts
it
on
the
table
for
willow
and
xander
to
see
oh
my
god
willow
reads
'have
a
nice
summer
have
a
nice
summer'
this
girl
had
no
friends
at
all
uh
once
again
i
teeter
at
the
precipice
of
the
generation
gap
'have
a
nice
summer'
is
what
you
write
when
you
have
nothing
to
say
it's
the
kiss
of
death
you
guys
didn't
know
marcie
ross
never
met
her
why
'cause
you
both
wrote
it
too
buffy
points
to
xander's
signature
'have
a
nice'
yeesh
where
am
i
willow
buffy
points
oh
'have
a
great
summer'
see
i
cared
you
guys
don't
remember
her
no
i
probably
didn't
see
her
except
to
sign
the
book
i
mean
this
is
a
big
school
willow
looks
at
her
printouts
xander
we
each
had
four
classes
with
her
last
year
so
no
one
noticed
her
and
now
she's
invisible
what
she
turned
invisible
because
no
one
noticed
her
giles
hits
the
table
of
course
giles
gets
up
i've
been
investigating
the
mystical
causes
of
invisibility
when
i
i
should
have
looked
at
the
quantum
mechanical
giles
gets
looks
from
them
all
physics
i
think
i
speak
for
everyone
here
when
i
say
huh
giles
gets
a
book
it's
a
rudimentary
concept
that
that
reality
is
shaped
even
even
created
by
our
perception
and
with
the
hellmouth
below
us
sending
out
mystical
energy
people
perceived
marcie
as
as
as
invisible
and
and
and
and
she
became
so
cut
to
ms
miller's
class
where
marcie
has
another
flashback
so
who
knows
the
answer
to
this
one
think
about
it
several
students
including
marcie
raise
their
hands
cordelia
well
just
because
the
story's
about
him
doesn't
necessarily
mean
he's
the
hero
right
exactly
so
what
do
we
call
him
willow
well
the
protagonist
xander
why
can't
he
be
both
i
mean
he
did
do
some
things
that
are
pretty
heroic
absolutely
who
doesn't
agree
with
that
several
students
including
marcie
raise
their
hands
ms
miller
points
to
one
okay
marcie
raises
her
hand
again
ms
miller
points
to
someone
else
and
how
about
you
marcie
becomes
weary
of
constantly
being
passed
over
and
sighs
she
looks
at
her
hand
and
watches
as
it
becomes
translucent
and
then
transparent
her
flashback
is
over
cut
to
the
library
this
isn't
this
great
power
that
she
can
control
it's
something
that
was
done
to
her
that
we
did
to
her
no
wonder
she's
miffed
what
does
she
want
just
what
we
thought
cordelia
she
turns
the
yearbook
to
willow
and
xander
to
show
them
the
marked
up
picture
of
cordelia
cordelia
comes
into
the
library
and
overhears
her
name
what
i
knew
you'd
be
here
buffy
i
uh
i
i
know
we've
had
our
differences
with
you
being
so
weird
and
all
and
hanging
out
with
these
total
losers
willow
and
xander
can't
believe
that
she
just
said
that
in
front
of
them
ooo
cordelia
exhales
well
anyway
despite
all
of
that
i
know
that
you
share
this
feeling
that
we
have
for
each
other
deep
down
nausea
somebody
is
after
me
they
just
tried
to
kill
ms
miller
uh
she
was
helping
me
with
my
homework
and
mitch
and
harmony
this
is
all
about
me
me
me
me
wow
for
once
she's
right
so
you've
come
to
me
for
help
cordelia
nods
because
you're
always
around
when
all
this
weird
stuff
is
happening
and
i
know
you're
very
strong
and
you've
got
all
those
weapons
i
was
kind
of
hoping
you
were
in
a
gang
buffy
can't
believe
what
she's
hearing
please
i
don't
have
anyone
else
to
turn
to
giles
gets
up
and
offers
her
a
chair
please
sit
down
okay
thanks
you
know
i
i
don't
recall
ever
seeing
you
here
before
oh
no
i
have
a
life
okay
buffy
exhales
cordelia
your
attacker
is
an
invisible
girl
who
is
really
really
angry
at
you
which
i
can't
imagine
personally
but
it
takes
all
kinds
y'know
well
i
don't
care
what
it
is
just
get
rid
of
it
well
it's
not
that
simple
it's
a
person
it's
buffy
shows
her
the
yearbook
it's
this
person
now
do
you
have
any
idea
why
she'd
be
so
oh
god
is
she
really
wearing
laura
ashley
so
homicidal
cordelia
exhales
i
have
no
idea
i've
never
seen
this
girl
before
in
my
life
cut
to
the
crawl
space
in
the
ceiling
marcie
maniacally
i
won
'cause
you
didn't
see
me
coming
cordelia
you
don't
remember
me
i
remember
you
all
your
idiot
slut
friends
i
hate
them
they
take
your
life
and
they
suck
it
out
of
you
but
then
they
didn't
see
me
coming
they
gotta
learn
they
gotta
learn
cut
to
the
library
according
to
what
you
told
us
about
the
attack
on
ms
miller
we
now
have
two
messages
from
marcie
'look'
and
'listen'
messages
we
don't
understand
i
don't
think
we're
supposed
to
yet
marcie's
not
quite
ready
but
from
what
she
did
to
cordelia's
picture
i
would
say
that
she's
wigged
on
the
whole
may
queen
thing
maybe
she's
gonna
do
something
about
it
stop
the
coronation
tonight
maybe
keep
you
guys
away
from
the
bronze
nothing
is
keeping
me
from
the
bronze
tonight
uh
can
we
just
revel
in
your
fabulous
lack
of
priorities
if
i'm
not
crowned
tonight
then
then
marcie's
won
and
that
would
be
bad
she's
evil
okay
way
eviler
than
me
cordelia
has
a
point
buffy's
with
me
on
this
anyway
continuing
the
normal
may
queen
activities
may
be
the
best
way
to
draw
marcie
out
we
can
use
cordelia
as
bait
great
bait
willow
xander
you'll
help
me
begin
our
research
anew
unless
we
find
a
way
to
cure
marcie's
invisibility
then
buffy
will
be
marcie
is
there
now
looking
down
from
the
stacks
a
sitting
duck
they
all
get
up
to
do
their
tasks
buffy
to
cordelia
c'mon
well
i
have
to
try
on
my
dress
and
am
i
really
bait
cut
to
the
halls
buffy
and
cordelia
are
walking
so
how
much
the
creepy
is
it
that
this
marcie's
been
at
this
for
months
spying
on
us
learning
our
most
guarded
secrets
so
are
you
saying
she's
invisible
because
she's
so
unpopular
that
about
sums
it
up
cordelia
exhales
bummer
for
her
it's
awful
to
feel
that
lonely
hmm
so
you've
read
something
about
the
feeling
cordelia
stops
buffy
hey
you
think
i'm
never
lonely
because
i'm
so
cute
and
popular
i
can
be
surrounded
by
people
and
be
completely
alone
it's
not
like
any
of
them
really
know
me
i
don't
even
know
if
they
like
me
half
the
time
people
just
want
to
be
in
a
popular
zone
sometimes
when
i
talk
everyone's
so
busy
agreeing
with
me
they
don't
hear
a
word
i
say
well
if
you
feel
so
alone
then
why
do
you
work
so
hard
at
being
popular
well
it
beats
being
alone
all
by
yourself
she
continues
down
the
hall
after
considering
that
for
a
moment
buffy
quickly
follows
cut
to
the
library
willow
hears
a
flute
play
shhh
listen
they
all
listen
for
a
moment
and
look
in
the
direction
of
the
music
come
on
cut
to
the
hall
they
come
out
of
the
library
we
could
talk
to
her
perhaps
reason
with
her
or
possibly
grab
her
there
are
three
of
us
let's
go
they
start
down
the
hall
cut
to
a
mop
closet
buffy
opens
the
door
and
turns
on
the
light
if
you
ever
tell
to
anyone
that
i
changed
in
a
mop
closet
your
secret
dies
with
me
buffy
looks
around
looks
