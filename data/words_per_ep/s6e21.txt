xander
panting
i

an
addictive
personality

couldn't
a
witch
at
her
level
she
can
only
go
airborne
anya
they
stop
walking
and
look
at
her
it's
a
thing
more
flashy
impresses
the
locals
but
it
does
take
longer
longer
than
what
teleporting
and
anya
disappears
in
a
swirl
of
magic
right
vengeance
demon
xander
sarcastic
well
at

she'll
get
there
first

counting
the
ways
that
could
go
wrong
buffy
they
resume
walking
well
anya
can
handle
herself
against
willow
tonight
don't
be
too
sure

should
be

some
point

i

was
out
of
her
head
running
on
grief

dangerous
and
they're
coming
cut
to
outside
a
cop
sits
in
his
police
car
looking
at
some
paperwork
he
looks
up
at
the
dashboard
a
cup
of
coffee
sits
on
the
dashboard
slowly
it
begins
to
jiggle
the
coffee
sloshing
around
in
the
cup
the
cop
stares
at
it
suddenly
a
flash
of
lightning
illuminates
his
face
he
looks
out
the
car
window
to
his
left
in
the
street
a
few
feet
away
there's
a
whirling
tornado
of
gray
smoke
with
lightning
flashing
around
it
it
coalesces
into
willow
leaves
and
random
trash
go
flying
down
the
street
in
the
wind
the
cop
gets
out
of
his
car
quickly
what
the
hell
was
that
willow
walks
toward
him
her
eyes
are
normal
at
this
point
though
her
hair
is
still
completely
black
listen
i
don't
know
what
you
think
you're
doing
but
just
willow

a
nap
the
cop
falls
down
on
the
ground
willow
looks
up
at
the
police
station

few
steps
to
size
it
up

mostly
brick
with
large
arched
windows

back
to
outside
willow
stands
on
the
street
staring
up
at
the
second
story
of
the
building
suddenly
one
of
the
bricks
covering
a
window
flies
out
cut
back
to
the
cell
the
brick
that
came
out
was
in
the
rear
wall
of
andrew
and
jonathan's
cell
they
turn
around
to
look
as
a
few
more
bricks
come
out

willow
watches
as
more
bricks
come
out
of
the
wall
falling
to
shatter
on
the
ground
in

of
her
andrew
and
jonathan
flatten
themselves
against
the
bars
as
far
from
the
wall
as
they

to
come
apart

staring
fixedly
at
the
building
bricks
continue
to
pop
out

a
piece
of
the
surrounding
wall
falls
out

falls
onto
a

and
yelling

standing
in
the
hallway

with
a
blast

we
have
to
make
a
run
for
it
buffy
peeks
around
the
corner
we
see
the
cops
still
gathered
by
the
front
door
holding
their
guns
and
staring
upward
some
cops
covering
their
ears
are
you
kidding
she's
like
dark
phoenix
up
there
you
expect
us
just
to
outrun
her
pretty
much
a
police
car
comes
roaring
up
behind
them
we
see
xander
at
the
wheel
get
in
buffy
pushes
andrew
and
jonathan
toward
the
door
they
start
to
climb
into
the
car
buffy
runs
around
to
the
other
side
the
car
starts
moving
with
buffy
not
yet
in
it
starts
around
the
corner
toward
the
gathered
cops
buffy
runs
alongside
gets
the
door
open
and
jumps
in
the
car
speeds
off
a
couple
of
cops
yell
and
chase
it
briefly
the
screaming
noise
continues
throughout
all
this
cut
to
a
little
later
the
car
drives
down
a
dark
street
is
she
coming
xander
checking
rearview
mirror
i
don't
see
anything
buffy
to
jonathan
and
andrew
in
the
back
seat
are
you
guys
all
right
they
stare
at
her
she
realizes
it
was
a
dumb
question
are
you
injured
i
i
don't
think
so
where
are
you
taking
us
buffy
pauses
we'll
find
someplace
safe
and
we'll
keep
you
there
until
we
can
stop
willow
run
and
hide
that's
your
brilliant
plan
i
don't
believe
this
boys
if
you
don't
knock
it
off
i
will
pull
this
car
over
and
you
can
just
walk
to
your
painful
deaths
from
here
cut
to
the
police
station
willow
walks
out
the
front
door
she
pauses
looks
around
starts
off
in
the
direction
the
car
went
cut
back
to
the
car
i
don't
get
it
willow's
a
witch
why
doesn't
she
just
you
know
wave
her
arms
and
make
us
dead
because
she
doesn't
want
you
dead
she
wants
to
kill
you
but
we
didn't
do
anything
buffy
twists
around
in
her
seat
and
punches
andrew
in
the
face
andrew
whiny
ow
hate
to
admit
it
buff
but
jonathan
may
have
a
point
why
isn't
she
right
here
right
now
buffy
uncertain
maybe
she's
just
getting
her
mojo
up
and
running
or
maybe
she
hasn't
figured
out
exactly
how
much
power
she
really
has
yet
buffy
beat
neither
have
we
guess
we
keep
running
then
i
still
can't
believe
that
was
willow
i
mean
i've
known
her
almost
as
long
as
you
guys
willow
was
you
know
she
packed
her
own
lunches
and
wore
floods
and
was
always
just
willow
beat
both
buffy
and
xander
look
pensive
suddenly
the
entire
car
shakes
violently
we
see
something
behind
it
very
close
xander
looks
in
the
mirror
geez
it
what
was
that
reveal
a
large
truck
behind
the
car
with
willow
standing
on

of
the
truck's
cab

holds
her
hands
in
front
of
her
elbows
extended
palms
facing
out
just
willow
the
truck
races
along
immediately
behind
the
car
pan
down
from
willow
to
reveal
the
truck
driver
struggling
with
the
steering
wheel
then
giving
up
and
throwing
his
hands
up
in
the
air
buffy
and
xander
look
nervously
at
their
side
mirrors
shot
of
the
truck
from
the
rear
window
of
the
car
the
truck's
grille
looms
very
close
the
truck
speeds
up
and
rams
the
back
of
the
car
a
second
time
xander
looks
scared
keeps
the
car
under
control
the
truck
rams
the
car
again
ookay
any
ideas
drive
faster
the
car
speeds
up
and
pulls
ahead
but
then
the
truck
speeds
up
and
catches
up
again
another
hit
the
bumper
of
the
car
comes
partly
detached
and
scrapes
along
the
ground
the
truck
hits
the
car
yet
again
everyone
in
the
car
looks
scared
this
is
faster
she
knows
you're
in
this
car
too
right
they
look
back
at
the
truck
right
buffy
looks
back
nervously
shot
of
willow
grimacing
hunching
over
a
little
she's
draining

whating
willow
grimaces
more
falls
down
to
a
sitting
position
on
top
of
the
truck
just
keep
going
long
shot
of
the
car
and
truck
rounding
a
corner
onto
a
wide
deserted
fourlane
road

car's
bumper
still
drags
behind
throwing
up
sparks

concentrates
on
his
driving
shot
of
willow
now
on
all
fours
and
staring
at
the
car
still
grimacing
buffy
andrew
and
jonathan
watch
anxiously
from
within
the
car
the
truck
driver
yanks
at
the
wheel
and
finds
it
responding
now
he
swerves
left
then
right
much
screeching
of
tires
the
truck
comes
to
a
stop
the
car
continues
speeding
away
the
driver
gives
a
sigh
of
relief
andrew
and
jonathan
watch
through
the
rear
window
of
the
car
andrew
relieved
laugh
cool
the
car
speeds
on
the
bumper

detaching
completely
and
lying
in

the
african
cave

very
dark
spike

there
shirtless
and
barefoot
wearing
his
black
pants
pacing
a
little
the
shadowy
demon
from

to
him

i
guess

with
the
written

looks
around
nervously
a
person
walks
up
behind
him
spike
turns
and
sees
him
he
appears
to
be
human
but
very
large
and
muscular
oh
here
we
go
then
just
me
and
the
walking
action
figure
i'm
venturing
this
would
be
the
killorbekilled
type
of
situation
then
to
the
death
right
spike
faces
his
opponent
anticipating
here
we
are
now
entertain
us
the
muscled
man
holds
up
his
fists
and
smacks
his
forearms
together
both
his
hands
burst
into
flame
spike
looks
alarmed
oh
son
of
a
b
muscleman
punches
spike
in
the
head
he
goes
down
another
punch
spike
scrambles
backward
on
his
butt
and
hands
shot
of
muscleman
from
spike's
pov
as
the
flaming
fist
swings
down
again
cut
to
a
back
alley
somewhere
night
two
people
walk
along
cut
closer
to
reveal
they
are
clem
and
dawn
rack's
place
was
right
around
here
last
time
oh
huh
i
don't
feel
anything
clem
quickly
oh
well
not
here
let's
go
home
you
don't
feel
anything
because
his
place
moves
i
told
you
dawn
they
stop
walking
know
why
rack
moves
all
the
time
because
he's
shady
a
bad
element
comes
down
here
i
get
that
but
willow's
part
of
it
now
she
is
the
element
if
she
isn't
around
somewhere
rack
may
know
where
she
is
which
is
why
we
need
to
talk
to
him
clem
nervous
we
in
a
face
to
face
way
dawn
impatient
or
me
i'll
go
in
there
without
you
no
no
it's
fine
i'm
good
it's
just
rack
isn't
partial
to
the
floppyeared
clem
dawn
looking
skeptical
he
has
a
thing
but
but
hey
i'm
in
absolutely
either
way
just
get
me
there
dawn
resumes
walking
say
rack
does
know
where
willow
is
he's
not
going
to
tell
you
for
nothing
he's
gonna
want
something
i
have
money
clem
sighs
that's
not
the
kind
of
something
he's
gonna
want
rack
likes
little
girls
dawn
stops
walking
angrily
i
am
not
a
little
girl
i
i
don't
know
if
you've
thought
this
through
i'm
supposed
to
keep
you
safe
clem
dawn
looking
annoyed
and
this
whole
thing
is
i
mean
even
if
you
find
willow
you
really
think
you
can
stop
her
dawn
stares
at
him
not
sure
what
to
say
cut
to
the
magic
shop
the
door
opens
and
anya
enters
followed
by
xander
then
andrew
jonathan
and
buffy
anya
strides
into
the
middle
of
the
room
impatiently
thanks
anya
for
getting
here
so
fast
it's
a
big
help
once
again
xander
in
need
of
the
big
help
whatever
so
can
you
still
sense
willow
knowing
her
location'd
be
a
real
big
comfort
right
about
now
they
go
over
to
the
table
that
still
holds
the
pile
of
now
blank
magic
books
no
i
can't
which
means
whatever
she's
feeling
it's
gone
way
beyond
simple
vengeance
did
i
mention
me
needing
the
comfort
whatever
we've
got
better
grab
it
fast
this
is
one
of
the
first
places
she's
gonna
think
to
look
for
us
andrew
alarmed
then
what
are
we
doing
here
you
know
i
could
summon
a
demon
that
would
kill
her
they
all
turn
to
look
at
him
angry
and
i
could
smack
you
so
hard
your
eyeballs
would
switch
sockets
buffy
no
one
is
getting
killed
sit
down
jonathan
and
andrew
go
to
sit
down
anya
moves
off
we
need
to
find
some
sort
of
magicks
that'll
stop
willow
or
at
least
slow
her
down
xander
but
she
drained
the
place
anya
does
something
at
the
cash
register
buffy
and
xander
look
at
the
blank
books
xander
holding
up
a
book
took
everything
not
everything
anya
has
a
small
key
in
her
hand
she
reaches
under
the
counter
to
pull
something
out
what
is
it
xander
and
buffy
walk
over
anya
produces
a
mediumsized
wooden
chest
she
opens
it
and
takes
out
a
book
um
book
of
protection
spells
antimagic
our
last
resort
think
you
can
work
this
stuff
anya
looking
at
book
ah
okay
well
the
good
news
is
text
is
intact
bad
news
is
ah
i
can't
read
a
word
of
it
it's
like
in
ancient
sumerian
or
something
close
on
the
book
whose
yellowing
pages
are
covered
in
symbols
jonathan
gets
up
walks
a
little
closer
could
i
take
a
look
at
it
shut
up
right
jonathan
starts
to
turn
back
to
his
seat
pauses
addresses
buffy
i
just
thought
you
know
as
long
as
you're
protecting
us
the
least
i
could
do
is
buffy
i'm
not
protecting
you
jonathan
none
of
us
are
we're
doing
this
for
willow
the
only
reason
it
happens
to
be
your
lucky
day
is
because
willow
kills
you
she
crosses
a
line
i
lose
a
friend
jonathan
gets
right
up
in
jonathan's
face
and
i
hate
losing
i
get
that
it's
just
you
know
she's
running
out
of
power
right
i
can
tell
i
can
practically
feel
it
jonathan
quietly
embarrassed
i've
dabbled
in
the
magicks
i
think
willow's
in
a
league
of
her
own
about
now
dabbleboy
but
still
running
that
hot
for
that
long
it's
just
a
matter
of
time
before
you
gotta
recharge
no
matter
how
juiced
up
you
are
thank
you
now
you
remember
that
thing
we
talked
about
about
me
shutting
up
buffy
nods
jonathan
whispers
right
he
goes
back
to
his
seat
beside
andrew
xander
pulls
buffy
aside
buffy
let's
say
this
works
and
we
stop
willow
from
working
the
hoodoo
for
a
minute
what
then
i
talk
to
her
great
and
say
what
buffy
takes
off
her
hat
runs
her
hand
through
her
hair
sighs
look
whatever
she's
gonna
do
she
starts
with
those
two
buffy
indicating
andrew
and
jonathan
they're
the
line
she
cannot
cross
and
if
she's
running
low
on
magicks
then
she's
probably
somewhere
right
now
trying
to
get
it
all
back
cut
to
rack's
place
night
the
door
opens
pov
of
someone
entering
the
room
revealing
a
junkie
boy
lying
blissedout
on
the
floor
with
his
eyes
closed
holding
a
lit
cigarette
pan
over
to
rack
sitting
on
the
floor
between
a
sofa
and
a
coffeetable
laying
out
runestones
on
the
sofa
he
doesn't
look
at
the
camera
hey
babe
i
been
waiting
for
you
he
lays
down
another
stone
and
looks
over
reveal
willow
standing
in
the
doorway
her
eyes
back
to
normal
guess
the
rehab
didn't
take
huh
that's
the
way
it
goes
sometimes
he
gets
up
and
walks
slowly
toward
her
but
i
gotta
say
i
could
feel
you
coming
a
mile
away
the
power
you
got
and
you
know
something
sweetness
rack
whispers
i
liked
it
he
keeps
moving
closer
all
sleazy
and
creepyseductive
willow
doesn't
react
just
stands
there
when
you
first
came
to
me
you
were
just
a
little
slip
of
a
girl
he
gets
right
up
behind
willow
puts
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
moves
them
down
out
of
shot
look
at
you
now
all
growed
up
so
full
of
dark
juice
he
moves
to
the
other
side
of
her
still
behind
her
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
he
reaches
up
and
brushes
hair
back
from
her
face
nuzzles
her
ear
she
still
just
stands
there
and
you
still
taste
like
strawberries
only
now

rack
moves
around
in
front
of
her
you're
ripe
he
stays
right
there
in
her
face
almost
like
he's
about
to
kiss
her
he
even
puts
his
hand
on
her
chin
you
came
because
you
want
something
don't
you
willow
nods
slowly
i
thought
so
rack
stroking
her
cheek
so
tell
me
strawberry
now
his
mouth
is
barely
an
inch
away
from
willow's
as
he
continues
to
caress
her
cheek
with
one
hand
what
on
this
earth
do
you
want
willow
lifts
her
own
hand
to
touch
rack's
face
the
same
way
but
then
she
starts
to
squeeze
just
to
take
a
little
tour
suddenly
her
other
hand
comes
up
and
smacks
onto
rack's
chest
magic
begins
to
flow
rack
gasps
and
groans
helplessly
his
body
glows
and
little
sparks
of
lightning
flash
around
him
willow
continues
to
hold
him
by
the
chin
with
one
hand
with
her
other
hand
on
his
chest
slowly
lifting
him
up
off
the
ground
as
the
magic
crackles
between
them
rack
continues
making
little
pained
groaning
noises
cut
to
the
alley
it's
empty
a
car
goes
by
cut
to
rack's
waiting
room
clem
enters
through
the
shimmery
magic
wall
looks
around
walks
farther
inside
dawn
appears
behind
him
yay
clem
making
with
the
demon
senses
i
knew
you'd
find
this
place
clem
looks
around
nervously
clem
softly
it's
not
very
clean
don't
wig
out
on
me
again
it's
just
i'm
still
not
so
sure
you
should
be
here
i'm
not
so
sure
i
should
be
here
it'll
only
take
a
minute
come
on
dawn
walks
toward
the
door
that
leads
to
the
inner
room
clem
watches
nervously
but
doesn't
follow
her
she
turns
back
sighs
you
wanna
wait
here
clem
relieved
if
that
works
for
you
be
right
back
she
opens
the
door
clem
looks
around
sighs
nervously
cut
to
the
inner
room
dawn
enters
slowly
looking
around
willow
she
turns
slowly
and
suddenly
comes
facetoface
with
rack
hanging
upside
down
with
his
head
at
dawn's
eyelevel
dead
dawn
screams
whimpers
turns
frantically
toward
the
door
but
willow
is
in
the
way
hey
cutie
dawn
stares
in
horror
willow's
hair
is
all
black
her
eyes
are
all
black
and
dark
veins
are
visible
all
over
her
face
she
gives
a
little
smile
blackout
act
iii

open
on
the
same
scene
we
see
rack's
floating
corpse
in
foreground
and
dawn
staring
fearfully
at
willow
in
background
dawnie
what
are
you
doing
here
'cause
if
you're
looking
for
me
now's
not
a
great
time
you
look
terrible
do
i
willow
starts
to
move
closer
to
dawn
you're
back
on
the
magicks
no
honey
i
am
the
magicks
dawn
backing
away
as
willow
advances
did
you
kill
that
guy
willow
shrugging
it's
an
improvement
believe
me
dawn
very
nervous
i
have
to
go
dawn
rushes
past
willow
and
toward
the
door
and
suddenly
willow
is
in
front
of
her
again
blocking
the
door
dawn
gives
a
little
yelp
of
fear
why
so
you
can
run
and
tell
buffy
willow
please
just
listen
to
me
you
don't
have
to
talk
just
think
real
loud
i
can
hear
you
willow
advances
again
and
dawn
backs
up
again
you're
freaking
me
out
oh
don't
be
like
that
i'm
just
a
little
wired
and
i
have
some
things
to
do
i
thought
if
anybody'd
understand
dawn
i
miss
tara
too
willow
stops
cold
glares
but
this
what
you're
doing
here
this
is
not
the
way
to
go
you're
only
going
to
make
things
worse
but
i
promise
it's
not
too
late
to
willow
you
miss
her
dawn
shocked
yes
did
you
cry
willow
dawn
still
looking
shocked
of
course
you
did
i
get
that
willow
resumes
walking
toward
dawn
and
dawn
resumes
backing
away
i
understand
the
crying
you
cry
because
you're
human
but
you
weren't
always
dawn
hurt
yes
i
was
no
please
you're
telling
me
you
don't
remember
you
used
to
be
some
mystic
ball
of
energy
maybe
that's
why
you're
crying
all
the
time
dawnie
'cause
you
don't
belong
here
dawn
finds
herself
backed
up
against
the
wall
gasping
anxiously
wanna
go
back
end
the
pain
you'll
be
happier
i'll
be
happier
we'll
all
be
a
lot
happier
without
listening
to
the
constant
whining
dawn
tearful
and
angry
willow
stop
willow
mockwhining
mom
buffy
tara
waah
it's
time
you
go
back
to
being
a
little
energy
ball
dawn
looks
very
scared
no
more
tears
dawnie
willow's
voice
echoes
weirdly
on
that
last
line
dawn
whimpers
and
presses
back
against
the
wall
willow
smiles
a
little
advancing
right
up
to
dawn
loud
bang
from
behind
willow
turns
buffy
stands
in
the
doorway
i
think
you
need
to
get
away
from
her
cut
to
the
magic
box
anya
sits
behind
the
counter
with
the
magic
book
open
in
front
of
her
a

babylonian
anya
and
xander
look
up
jonathan
is
standing
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
counter
the
text
is
similar
but
the
dialect
is
completely
different
great
babylonian
thanks
a
bushel
but
unless
you
can
read
babylonian
why
don't
you
sit
back
down
jonathan
goes
back
to
sit
next
to
andrew
again
andrew
softly
why
are
you
helping
them
because
they're
saving
our
lives
you
moron
uhhuh
and
what
then
even
if
they
kill
that
wicca
bitch
you
think
they're
just
gonna
let
us
walk
they
own
us
so
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
look
around
you
know
magic
we're
in
a
magic
shop
we
can
take
them
jonathan
looks
at
him
incredulously
the
books
are
sucked
dry
but
so
what
there's
still
like
tons
of
supplies
all
around
us
this
is
the
best
chance
we're
gonna
get
to
make
it
out
of
here
and
do
what
start
over
we
can
be
a
duo
you
and
me
you
can
even
be
the
leader
i
swear
i'll
take
orders
andrew
jonathan
looking
contemplative
i
like
taking
orders
just
tell
me
what
to
do
jonathan
looks
like
he's
considering
it
you
want
an
order
suddenly
jonathan
jumps
up
grabbing
andrew
by
the
front
of
his
shirt
and
slams
him
against
a
bookcase
grow
up
hey
now
play
nice
fellas
or
you'll
break
our
concentration
which
means
no
protection
spell
jonathan
lets
go
of
andrew
and
willow
will
make
you
two
boneless
chickens
skinless
too
and
then
what
you
think
your
little
witch
buddy's
gonna
stop
with
us
andrew
xander
and
anya
glaring
at
him
you
saw
her
she's
a
truckdriving
magic
mama
and
we've
got
maybe
seconds
before
darth
rosenberg
grinds
everybody
into
jawaburgers
and
not
one
of
you
bunch
has
the
midichlorians
to
stop
her
you've
never
had
any
tiny
bit
of
sex
have
you
the
annoying
virgin
has
a
point
what
if
willow
fillets
their
soles
and
then
comes
after
us
she
won't
you
don't
know
that
we're
her
friends
anya
her
family
she
would
never
hurt
us
she
tried
to
use
you
for
a
hood
ornament
xander
she
doesn't
care
if
you
live
or
die
xander
looks
stung
by
that
guess
you
two
finally
have
something
in
common
beat
anya
looks
slightly
chastised
she
turns
back
to
her
research
i
care
if
you
live
or
die
xander
i'm
just
not
sure
which
one
i
want
again
with
the
comfort
look
we
both
know
things
might
get
ugly
at
uh
wiccapalooza
and
if
it
gets
really
bad
anya
still
not
looking
at
him
let
me
guess
you'll
propose
xander
looks
a
bit
hurt
by
that
too
but
he
presses
on
i
need
to
know
if
you're
gonna
turn
on
me
use
this
little
shindig
as
an
excuse
for
some
sweet
revenge
anya
finally
turns
to
look
at
him
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
that
could
give
me
greater
or
more
lasting
satisfaction
than
to
reap
bloody
vengeance
upon
you
xander
harris
but
i
can't
not
officially
not
magically

anya
sarcastic
so
smile
it's
your
lucky
day
you
got
away
with
it
i
can't
hurt
you
right
'cause
you
varnishing
the
table
with
spike
how
could
that
possibly
have
hurt
it
may
have
chafed
anya
more
quietly
that
wasn't
vengeance
it
was
solace
xander
looks
surprised
and
very
hurt
anya
looks
upset
too
anya
sighs
look
i
really
can't
hurt
you
so
i'm
just
gonna
have
to
settle
for
hating
you
if
that's
what
you
need
to
do
anya
angry
don't
you
don't
get
to
play
the
martyr
i'm
not
you
know
none
of
this
would
be
happening
if
it
weren't
for
you
you
think
i
don't
know
that
you
think
i'm
the
hero
of
this
piece
xander
upset
i
saw
the
gun
before
warren
raised
it
i
i
saw
it
and
i
couldn't
move
he
shot
two
of
my
friends
before
i
could
even
you
want
me
to
know
how
useless
i
am
that
it's
my
fault
thanks

the
memo
anya

sympathetic
anya
softly
i
was
talking
about
us
they
return
to
studying
their
books

back
to
rack's
you
need
to
back
down
a
minute
and
think

i
wasn't
gonna
hurt
her
buzzkill
dawn
whispers
upset
she
tried
to
turn
me
back
buffy
advancing
slowly
you're
attacking
the
people
who
love
you
now
only
the
ones
in
my
way
that's
not
you
need
help
i'm
doing
fine
on
my
own
thanks
buffy
gets
right
up
next
to
them
still
moving
slowly
suddenly
she
reaches
out
and
grabs
dawn
dawn
get
out
of
here
go
dawn
runs
to
the
door
but
it's
suddenly
locked
don't
we're
all
friends
willow
i
know
what
you
want
to
do
but
you
have
to
listen
to
me
the
forces
inside
you
are
incredibly
powerful
they're
strong
but
you're
stronger
buffy
dawn
cowering
in
the
corner
you
have
to
remember
you're
still
willow
willow
scoffs
let
me
tell
you
something
about
willow
willow
advancing
toward
buffy
she's
a
loser
and
she
always
has
been
people
picked
on
willow
in
junior
high
school
high
school
up
until
college
with
her
stupid
mousy
ways
and
now
willow's
a
junkie
i
can
help
the
only
thing
willow
was
ever
good
for
she
pauses
drops
the
bitter
sarcasm
and
grows
pensive
the
only
thing
i
had
going
for
me
were
the
moments
just
moments
when
tara
would
look
at
me
and
i
was
wonderful
willow
grimly
and
that
will
never
happen
again
i
know
this
hurts
bad
but
willow
if
you
let
loose
with
the
magicks
it
will
never
end
willow
smiles
nastily
promise
you
don't
want
that
why
not
dawn
moves
away
from
the
wall
and
approaches
them
because
you
lose
everything
your
friends
your
self
willow
if
you
let
this
control
you
then
the
world
goes
away
and
all
of
us
with
it
there's
so
much
to
live
for
buffy
forcefully
will
there's
too
much
willow
buffy
scoffs
oh
please
this
is
your
pitch
buffy
you
hate
it
here
as
much
as
i
do
i'm
just
more
honest
about
it
that's
not
true
you're
trying
to
sell
me
on
the
world
the
camera
starts
to
do
a
slow
turn
thing
where
it
stays
focused
on
willow
but
the
background
turns
behind
her
the
one
where
you
lie
to
your
friends
when
you're
not
trying
to
kill
them
and
you
screw
a
vampire
just
to
feel
and
insane
asylums
are
the
comfy
alternative
this
world
buffy
it's
me
i
know
you
were
happier
when
you
were
in
the
ground
the
only
time
you
were
ever
at
peace
in
your
whole
life
is
when
you
were
dead
until
willow
brought
you
back
the
background
has
been
changing
as
it
turns
you
know
with
magic
buffy
suddenly
blinks
looks
disoriented
oh
sorry
the
trip
can
be
kind
of
rough
dawn
standing
next
to
willow
is
looking
shocked
and
disoriented
too
we
see
that
they
are
now
in
the
magic
shop
if
you're
you
know
not
me
we
see
xander
behind
the
counter
staring
at
them
in
surprise
dawn
looks
around
suddenly
collapses
on
the
floor
dawn
buffy
kneels
next
to
dawn
willow
turns
spots
the
remaining
two
nerds
sitting
at
the
table
again
willow
smiles
jonathan
andrew
willow
the
geeks
looking
scared
you
boys
like
magic
don't
you
she
smiles
as
magic
starts
to
flow
around
her
abracadabra
she
lifts
both
her
hands
toward
them
streams
of
purpleblack
magic
flow
from
her
hands
and
toward
them
a
breeze
ruffles
her
hair
lightning
flashes
blackout
act
iv

same
scene
willow
is
throwing
magic
at
the
nerds
but
it
stops
before
it
actually
reaches
them
willow
stops
okay
didn't
see
that
coming
the
nerds
are
unharmed
and
surprised
wwhat
was
that
we're
alive
you
guys
want
to
take
it
slow
willow
jonathan
and
andrew
exchanging
a
fearful
look
i
can
do
that
too
willow
smiles
ask
warren
willow
lifts
her
hands
and
resumes
with
the
magic
shot
of
buffy
sitting
on
the
floor
beside
dawn
both
leaning
against
the
counter
looking
weak
don't
willow
continues
throwing
magic
across
the
table
at
the
geeks
who
are
scared
but
untouched
reveal
anya
in
a
hidden
nook
around
the
corner
holding
the
magic
book
and
muttering
in
sumerian
or
possibly
babylonian
she
looks
nervously
around
the
corner
and
we
can
see
the
light
from
willow's
magic
illuminating
anya
she
looks
back
down
at
the
book
continuously
chanting
willow
stops
again
jonathan
and
andrew
exchange
another
fearful
look
let's
get
out
of
here
they
move
toward
one
side
of
the
table
to
go
around
it
willow
moves
that
way
too
they
stop
run
the
other
way
and
toward
the
door
to
the
back
which
is
standing
open
no
no
stay
the
door
closes
itself
in
front
of
them
they
stop
turn
back
i
mean
we're
just
getting
started
behind
willow
buffy
and
dawn
finally
get
up
jonathan
and
andrew
grab
swords
that
are
hanging
on
the
wall
i've
got
big
party
plans

xander
buffy
to
buffy
no
don't
guys
come
on
i'm
just
getting
wood
for
the
violence
here
and
you
know
what
they
say
if
at
first
you
don't
succeed
she
lifts
her
hands
and
starts
blasting
magic
again
cut
to
the
cave
spike
hurtles
against
a
wall
groaning
he
has
a
large
bruise
or
burn
on
his
chest
and
various
other
burns
and
injuries
he
slumps
down
onto
the
ground
wipes
blood
from
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
one
hand
had
enough
he
pulls
himself
to
his
feet
the
muscleman
with
the
flaming
hands
punches
spike
again
he
stumbles
backward
goes
around
a
large
pillar
comes
out
from
the
other
side
and
takes
a
swing
muscleman
ducks
punches
spike
again
he
reels
against
another
wall
bounces
back
takes
a
few
more
punches
and
goes
down
on
the
next
punch
spike
grabs
the
other
man's
fist
flames
and
all
he
winces
in
pain
but
holds
on
then
shoves
muscleman
back
with
a
strong
thrust
spike
holding
up
his
burnt
hand
bad
move
bad
move
bad
move
he
ducks
another
punch
grabs
muscleman's
arm
and
flips
him
over
onto
his
back
while
muscleman
is
on
the
ground
spike
kicks
him
in
the
groin
flipping
him
over
spike
straddles
muscleman's
shoulders
and
takes
hold
of
his
head
twists
it
violently
breaking
his
neck
spike
straightens
up
panting
looks
like
local
boy
loses
the
demon
reappears
still
in
shadow
so
we
can't
see
it
too
clearly
so
it
would
appear
good
on
me
then
i
get
what
i
came
for
i
passed
right
indeed
you
have
passed
the
first
stage
of
the
test
right
i
get
spike
pauses
wait
first
stage
silence
the
demon's
eyes
glow
greenishblue
bugger
cut
back
to
the
magic
box
willow
is
still
sending
magic
toward
the
nerds
they
stand
wincing
holding
their
swords
as
the
magic
fails
to
harm
them
willow
stops
again
seeming
amused
damn
that
is
one
effective
counterspell
jonathan
and
andrew
stare
at
her
scared
clutching
the
swords
won't
keep
you
alive
though
will
stop
you
need
to
give
this
up
now
willow
ignoring
her
i
get
it
you
boys
put
a
a
spell
on
yourselves
didn't
you
protecting
you
from
harm
from
magicks
that's
cute
will
back
off
before
somebody
gets
hurt
how
'bout
i
back
off
right
after
willow
to
nerds
so
which
one
of
you
boys
worked
the
mojo
the
nerds
just
stare
too
scared
to
say
anything
doesn't
matter
really
i'm
just
curious
shot
of
anya
still
hiding
in
her
nook
chanting
her
protection
spell
just
because
i
can't
do
magicks
to
you
doesn't
mean
i
can't
do
them
on
myself
magic
crackles
around
willow
as
she
bends
her
head
and
mutters
something
in
latin
more
swirling
magic
and
crackles
of
lightning
just
around
willow
then
the
magic
fades
and
she
lifts
her
head
smiling
now
i'm
pretty
sure
i'm
strong
enough
to
beat
you
to
death
the
boys
have
retreated
behind
the
table
again
willow
reaches
down
and
casually
takes
hold
of
a
corner
of
the
table
topples
it
over
and
throws
it
aside
with
ease
the
books
go
flying
the
table
lies
on
its
side
the
boys
look
terrified
willow
starts
toward
them
buffy
moves
over
and
blocks
her
way
i
don't
want
to
hurt
you
willow
punches
buffy
buffy
flies
backward
a
long
way
crashing
into
a
magazine
rack
against
a
wall
the
geeks
look
even
more
scared
xander
looks
alarmed
moves
in
front
of
dawn
not
a
problem
willow
starts
toward
the
guys
again
buffy
gets
up
now
wearing
her
kickass
expression
she
strides
over
to
get
in
front
of
willow
again
i
said
i
didn't
want
to
buffy
backhands
willow
now
it's
willow's
turn
to
fly
backward
crashing
into
a
glass
display
case
crash
tinkle
broken
glass
and
wood
and
merchandise
everywhere
willow
lands
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
didn't
say
i
wouldn't
xander
rushes
toward
the
nerds
let's
go
what
about
willow
buffy
can
handle
her
are
you
sure
no
that's
why
we're
leaving
xander
dawn
jonathan
and
andrew
rush
for
the
door
on
the
way
xander
passes
anya
in
her
nook

can't
i
i
have
to
stay
here
to
keep
the
spell
going
on
willow
no
but
anya
harshly
go
do
something
right
xander
hesitates
just
another
instant
then
takes
off
with
the
others
anya
resumes
chanting
xander
dawn
and
the
nerds
get
to
the
door
open
it
start
out
willow
still
on
the
floor
looks
up
and
sees
this
no
willow
gets
up
but
buffy
strides
up
behind
her
and
grabs
the
back
of
her
jacket
throws
her
back
away
from
the
door
willow
slides
across
the
floor
comes
to
a
stop
by
the
stairs
leading
up
to
the
loft
buffy
stands
there
ready
willow
gets
up
and
faces
buffy
it's
a
showdown
zoom
in
on
willow's
face
zoom
in
on
buffy's
face
so
willow
smiling
here
we
are
are
we
really
gonna
do
this
come
on
this
is
a
huge
deal
for
me
six
years
as
a
side
man
and
now
i
get
to
be
the
slayer
a
killer
isn't
a
slayer
being
a
slayer
means
something
you
can't
conceive
of
willow
sighing
shaking
her
head
oh
buffy
you
really
need
to
have
every
square
inch
of
your
ass
kicked
then
show
me
what
you
got
and
i'll
show
you
what
a
slayer
really
is
they
move
toward
each
other
and
begin
to
fight
first
they
grapple
and
willow
tries
a
headbutt
then
kicks
buffy
in
the
stomach
punches
her
buffy
ducks
another
swing
and
hits
willow
then
punches
her
in
the
face
willow
does
a
spinkick
and
gets
buffy
in
the
face
then
another
kick
buffy
tries
to
kick
willow
but
willow
does
a
flip
over
her
head
landing
behind
buffy
buffy
turns
and
kicks
willow
tries
to
punch
but
willow
grabs
her
arm
and
hits
her
with
her
other
hand
willow
throws
buffy
across
the
room
and
against
a
bookcase
cut
to
the
street
andrew
still
holding
his
sword
walks
along

away
and

back
to
the
magic
shop

times

her
punch
and
shoves
her
across
the
room
bringing
down
more
furniture
and
merchandise

crashing
stuff

willow
sits
up
and
notices
anya

alarmed

up
buffy
runs
over
to

but
willow
just
shoves
her
aside
into
yet
another
table
covered
with
stuff
more
crashing
and
shattering
anya
keeps
chanting
defiantly
staring
at
willow
who
advances
on
her
looks
like

been
beating
on
the
wrong
gal

the
street

the
magic
box

anya
by
the
throat
holding
her
up
off
the
ground

very
scared

past
willow
to
buffy
lying
apparently
unconscious
among
the
wreckage
of
the
furniture

me
anya
to
willow

hurting
me
you
can't
block
my
spells
if

can't
chant
if
you're
sleepin'
willow
throws
anya
aside
anya
crashes
into
another
bookcase
and
falls
to
the
ground
groaning
possibly
unconscious
willow
looks
over
at
buffy
who
is
conscious
now
and
gets
to
her
feet
they
square
off
again
buffy
i
gotta
tell
ya
i
get
it
now
the
slayer
thing
really
isn't
about
the
violence
they
circle
around
each
other
watching
each
other
carefully
it's
about
the
power
magic
begins
to
crackle
around
willow
again
she
lifts
her
hands
and
blasts
buffy
with
a
bolt
of
magic
it
throws
buffy
back
onto
the
desk
she
slides
across
the
desk
and
lands
on
the
floor
beside
it
groaning
willow
walks
a
little
closer
looking
satisfied
buffy
doesn't
get
up
stays
down
with
her
forehead
pressed
against
the
floor
looking
exhausted
and
there's
no
one
in
the
world
with
the
power
to
stop
me
now
suddenly
a
huge
blast
of
green
magic
energy
hits
willow
from
the
side
she
goes
flying
a
huge
distance
across
the
room
lands
on
the
floor
and
slides
some
more
she
comes
to
a
stop
and
lifts
her
head
her
nose
is
bleeding
she
looks
surprised
looks
up
in
the
direction
the
magic
came
from
reveal
giles
standing
in
the
doorway
wearing
a
long
black
coat
and
no
glasses
i'd
like
to
test
that
theory
blackout
end
of
episode
since
this
was
aired
as
a
2hour
movie
with
grave

no
closing
credits
