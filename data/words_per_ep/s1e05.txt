the
cemetery
buffy
is
fighting
a
vampire
she
kicks
him
in
the
face
with
a
high
roundhouse
kick
forcing
him
to
step
backward
to
keep
his
balance
the
vampire
does
a
jumping
half
twisting
crescent
kick
which
buffy
ducks
he
tries
two
punches
and
buffy
neatly
blocks
them
on
his
third
punch
she
grabs
hold
of
his
arm
and
hits
him
in
the
face
with
a
high
front
snap
kick
letting
go
of
the
vampire's
arm
buffy
punches
him
squarely
in
the
midsection
and
follows
up
with
a
swinging
punch
to
his
face
sending
him
to
the
ground
we
haven't
been
properly
introduced
buffy
pulls
out
a
stake
i'm
buffy
and
you're
history
she
plunges
the
stake
into
him
as
he
gets
up
he
falls
and
bursts
into
ashes
giles
pops
up
from
behind
a
crypt
poor
technique
giles
comes
around
to
her
prioritizing
sub
par
execution
was
adequate
but
a
bit
too
bloody
for
my
taste
giles
don't
mention
it
it
was
my
pleasure
to
make
the
world
safe
for
humanity
again
i'm
not
saying
that
your
methods
are
without
merit
it's
uh
y
you're
spending
too
much
time
and
energy
it
should
simply
be
plunge
and
move
on
plunge
and
hello
giles
bends
over
to
pick
up
a
ring
with
his
pen
buffy
sees
the
ring
oh
that's
great
i
kill
'em
you
fence
their
stuff
buffy
giles
gives
her
a
look
what
is
it
i
don't
know
but
it
bothers
you
yes
well
i
i
thought
this
vampire
was
just
on
a
random
kill
but
it
may
be
something
else
something
big
yes
i'd
best
consult
my
books
cut
to
the
master's
lair
he
slams
a
book
down
on
the
podium
opens
it
and
reads
'and
there
will
be
a
time
of
crisis
of
worlds
hanging
in
the
balance
and
in
this
time
shall
come
the
anointed
the
master's
great
warrior
and
the
slayer
will
not
know
him
will
not
stop
him
and
he
will
lead
her
into
hell'
as
it
is
written
so
shall
it
be
master
picks
up
the
book
and
walks
'five
will
die
and
from
their
ashes
the
anointed
shall
rise
the
brethren
of
aurelius
shall
greet
him
and
usher
him
to
his
immortal
destiny'
master
stops
by
one
of
the
brethren
as
it
is
written
so
shall
it
be
'and
one
of
the
brethren
shall
go
out
hunting
the
night
before
and
get
himself
killed
because
he
couldn't
wait
to
finish
his
job
before
he
ate'
oh
wait
master
grabs
one
of
the
brethren
by
the
throat
that's
not
written
anywhere
master
he
lifts
the
vampire
from
his
feet
the
anointed
will
be
my
greatest
weapon
against
the
slayer
if
you
fail
to
bring
him
to
me
if
you
allow
that
girl
to
stop
you
master
throws
the
vampire
into
a
coffin
here
endeth
the
lesson
he
slams
the
book
shut
and
walks
off
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

the
library
buffy
is
sitting
on
the
table
and
studying
the
ring
giles
makes
his
way
down
to
her
from
the
stacks
while
leafing
through
a
book
that
symbol
on
the
ring
i
believe
it's
the
rune
for
fidelity
but
uh
it
doesn't
connect
with
any
of
the
sects
that
i've
studied
what
about
this
buffy
shows
him
the
ring
on
the
inside
it's
a
sun
and
three
stars
haven't
we
seen
that
somewhere
let
me
see
giles
takes
the
ring
and
looks
closely
no
ii
don't
think
this
um
represents
any
buffy
looks
in
a
book
wait

right
here
sun
and
three
stars
yuch
check
these
guys
out
buffy

two
points
for
the
slayer
while

watcher
has
yet

to
suspect
that

a
myth
i
lost
my
emily
dickinson

dumb
but
i
like
her
around
kind
of
a
security
blanket

have
something
like
that
well
it's
an
actual
blanket
uh
and
i
don't
really
carry
it
around
anymore
so
emily
dickens
huh
she's
great
dickinson

good
also
giles
points
at
the
stacks
poetry
owen
to
buffy

up
the
stairs
buffy
follows
owen
w

bookwormy
owen
finds
his
book
the
type
of
person
to
lock
themselves
in
a
dark
room
with
a
lotta
musty
old
books
owen
looks
up
from
the
book
oh

i've
offended

just
surprised

gave
any
thought
to
what
i'm
like

shouldn't
be
owen
starts
back
down
buffy
follows
again
oh
well
i
love

really
love

owen
sees
the
book
they
were
consulting
earlier
on
the

over
there
to
take
a
look
what's
this
buffy
gets
between
him
and
the
book

this
one
giles
picks
the
book
up

takes
owen's
book

the
checkout
station

buffy
stares
after
him
the
order
of
aurelius

a
very
old
and
venerated
sect

for
a
good
reason
that
was
owen
yes
i
remember
do
you
have
any
more
copies
of
emily
dickinson
i
need
one
giles
exasperated
buffy
while
the
mere
fact
of
you
wanting
to
check
out
a
book
would
be
grounds
for
a
national
holiday
i
think
we
should
focus
on
the
problem
at
hand
right
i'm
sorry
you're
right
vampires
buffy
looks
down
at
her
dress
oh
buffy

a
very
big

willow
smiles
at

thank

willow
turns
back
to
giles
confused
wait
they
follow
giles
into
the
library
cut
into
the
library
what
are
you
talking
about
what
are
you
talking
about
boys
yes
well
i'm
talking
about
trouble
a
violent
and
disturbing
prophecy
is
about
to
be
fulfilled
the
order
of
aurelius
you
were
spot
on
about
the
connection
giles
walks
over
to
the
table
i've
looked
at
the
writings
of
aurelius
himself
and
he
he
prophesied
that
the
brethren
of
his
order
would
come
to
the
master
and
bring
him
the
anointed
who's
that
well
ii
don't
know
exactly
aaaa
warrior
but
but
it
says
he
will
rise
from
the
ashes
of
the
five
on
the
evening
of
the
thousandth
day
after
the
advent
of
septus
well
we'll
be
ready
whenever
it
is
which
is
tonight
buffy
takes
in
the
information
tonight
okay
buffy
realizes
the
conflict
not
okay
it
can't
be
tonight
my
calculations
are
precise
nuh
they're
bad
calculations
bad
buffy
has
a
really
important
date
owen
alright
ii'll
just
jump
in
my
time
machine
go
back
to
the
twelfth
century
and
ask
the
vampires
to
postpone
their
ancient
prophecy
for
a
few
days
while
you
take
in
dinner
and
a
show
okay
at
this
point
you're
abusing
sarcasm
buffy
this
is
no
ordinary
vampire
but
we
have
to
stop
him
before
he
reaches
the
master
but
cute
guy
teenager
postpubescent
fantasies
those
will
just
have
to
be
put
on
hold
the
dark
forces
are
aligning
against
us
and
we
have
a
chance
to
beat
them
back
tonight
we
go
into
battle
cut
to
the
graveyard
giles
and
buffy
are
sitting
on
a
large
gravestone
giles
sniffs
perhaps
i
miscalculated
i'm
thinking
yes
buffy
sucks
her
drink
dry
well
you
know
what
they
say
90
of
the
vampire
slaying
game
is
is
waiting
you
couldn't
have
told
me
that
90
ago
well
we
we've
certainly
waited
here
long
enough
giles
gets
up
besides
there
aren't
any
fresh
graves
who's
gonna
rise
apparently
no
one
tonight
buffy
jumps
up
then
i
can
bail
i
can
go
to
the
bronze
and
find
owen
oh
very
well
then
follow
your
hormones
if
you
want
giles
buffy
hops
down
and
starts
to
go
but
i
assume
i
don't
have
to
warn
you
about
the
hazards
of
becoming
personally
involved
with
someone
whose
unaware
of
your
unique
condition
yeah
yeah
i
read
the
back
of
the
box
if
your
identity
as
the
slayer
is
revealed
it
could
put
you
and
all
those
around
you
in
grave
danger
well
in
that
case
i
won't
wear
my
button
that
says
'i'm
the
slayer
ask
me
how'
buffy
gets
a
look
from
giles
good
night
buffy
leaves
'five
shall
die
and
from
their
ashes
the
anointed
shall
rise'

tweety
wristwatch
well
we
could
invite
the
chess
club
but
they
drink
and
they
start
fights
oh
no
it's
just
well
i
sort
of
heard
that
you
and
cordelia
were
somewhat
all
over
each
other
a
little
i
danced
with
her
a
couple
of
times
owen
with
a
look
of
distaste
she's
kinda
grabby
oh
well
let's
see
if
i
rearrange
that
and
i
push
that
to
n
sure
tonight'll
work
great
i'll
pick
you
up
at
seven
um
seven
that's
when
the
little
hand's
owen
points
on
the
pocket
watch
there
oh
between
the
six
and
the
eight
um
i'll
see
you
then
owen
leaves
buffy
watches
him
go
tonight
isn't
that
so
what
me
and
owen
buffy
walks
off
xander
feeling
down
yeah
so
it
is
xander
closes
his
locker
it
sure
is
so
cut
to
giles'
office
he
has
a
headache
from
researching
and
is
just
sitting
down
to
have
some
tea
buffy
barges
in
hey
how's
it
going
uh
alright
that's
great
i
see
we're
still
working
on
that
anointed
one
problem
that'll
probably
take
you
a
few
days
right
i
mean
that's
one
obscure
prophecy
well
yes
there
are
a
few
interpretations
so
tonight's
looking
slow
right
probably
best
to
relax
and
regroup
no
big
disasters
coming
that
is
so
good
i
will
see
you
tomorrow
then
bye
buffy
leaves
quickly
she
is
the
strangest
girl
cut
to
the
master's
lair
you
have
done
well
everything
is
in
place
when
this
night's
work
is
done
i
will
have
a
mighty
ally
i'll
be
one
step
closer
to
freeing
myself
from
this
mystical
prison
master
feels
his
confines
i've
been
trapped
down
here
so
long
i've
nearly
forgotten
what
it's
like
on
the
surface
well
there'll
be
time
enough
to
remember
when
i
rule
it
if
she
tries
to
stop
you
kill
her
give
your
own
lives
but
do
not
fail
to
bring
the
anointed
i
know
you
won't
disappoint
me
master
quickly
grabs
a
bug
from
the
air
bug
cut
to
buffy's
room
she's
wearing
her
bathrobe
and
willow
is
helping
her
decide
on
an
outfit
pick
buffy
to
xander
okay
buffy
willow
holds
up
one
minidress
do
i
wanna
appear
shy
coy
and
naive
or
buffy
willow
holds
up
the
other
unrestrained
insatiable
and
aggressive
xander
watching
from
the
bed
uh
y'know
owen
is
a
little
home
spun
he
probably
doesn't
like
that
overly
assertive
look
xander
goes
to
her
closet
oh
hey
here's
something
a
nice
comfy
overcoat
and
a
ski
cap
xander
holds
them
up
to
her
the
ear
flaps
will
bring
out
your
eyes
buffy
and
willow
exchange
a
look
maybe
i
should
mix
and
match
buffy
willow
nods
okay
guy's
opinion
buffy
grabs
two
lipsticks
from
her
desk
which
one
do
you
think
owen
will
like
better
buffy
holds
them
up
the
red
or
the
peach
oh
you
mean
for
kissing
you
and
then
telling
all
his
friends
how
easy
you
are
so
the
whole
school
loses
respect
for
you
and
then
talks
behind
your
back
the
red's
fine
thanks
i'll
go
with
the
peach
buffy
puts
on
the
lipstick
willow
hands
buffy
a
third
minidress
here
put
this
on
buffy
and
willow
look
at
xander
you're
not
bothering
me
willow
sighs
and
pushes
him
away
willow
to
buffy
so
where's
he
taking
you
oh
i
don't
know
where
do
you
suppose
young
kids
go
on
dates
these
days
buffy
unties
her
bathrobe
xander
goes
over
to
her
drawer
chest
and
tries
to
angle
the
mirror
inside
a
box
so
he
can
see
well
i
read
somewhere
once
that
sometimes
they
go
to
movies
buffy
finishes
pulling
on
the
minidress
movies
interesting
and
i
saw
on
tv
once
a
bunch
of
people
our
age
went
to
a
party
buffy
pulls
on
a
boot
wow
i
never
knew
being
a
teenager
was
so
full
of
possibilities
buffy
pulls
on
the
other
boot
xander
fumbles
with
the
box
buffy
and
willow
look
over
at
him
the
door
bell
rings
that's
owen
cut
to
buffy
opening
the
door
that's
giles
we
need
to
talk
buffy's
not
home
buffy
tries
to
close
the
door
giles
pushes
the
door
open
and
comes
in
my
calculations
may
not
have
been
as
far
off
as
i
thought
giles
holds
up
a
newspaper
buffy
reads
'five
die
in
van
accident'
out
of
the
ashes
of
five
shall
rise
the
one
that's
the
prophecy
five
people
have
died
in
a
car
crash
i
know
it
doesn't
quite
follow
but
but
it's
worth
investigating
look
among
the
dead
was
andrew
borba
whom
the
police
sought
for
questioning
in
a
double
murder
now
he
may
be
the
anointed
one
the
the
bodies
have
been
taken
to
to
sunnydale
funeral
home
wwe
can
buffy
interrupts
giles
why
do
you
wanna
hurt
me
i
beg
your
pardon
owen
shows
up
at
the
open
door
hey

okay
this

my
maiden
voyage
cut
to
the
next
room
what
she
doesn't
like
to
dance
well
it's
a
little
too
late
to
do
anything
about
that
uh
you
should
probably
know
that
buffy
doesn't
like
to
be
kissed
actually
she
doesn't
like
to
be
touched
xander
as
a
matter
of
fact
don't
even
look
at
her
cut
back
to
the
foyer
we
don't
even
know
if
this
is
anything
no
we
don't
and
i
haven't
had
a
day
off

a
while
true
and
a
cranky
slayer
is
a
careless
slayer
buffy
maintaining
a
normal
social
life
as
a
slayer
iiis
problematic
at
best
this
is
the
90's
the
1990's
in
point
of
fact
and
i
can
do
both
clark
kent

a
job

incredibly
morbid

lot
of
loss
a
lot
of
death
it
gets
me
with
a
lot
about
bees
for
some
reason
did
she
have
a
tragic
and
romantic
life
with
a
lotta
bees
quiet
kind
of
sequestered
and
uneventful
which
i
can
really
relate
to
i
don't
get
out
much
i
don't
get
that
it's
my
fault

frivolous

a
lot
more
important
things
in
life
than
dating
