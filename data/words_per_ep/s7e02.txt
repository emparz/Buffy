two

we'll
sort

around
some

will
be
sent
to
you
and
others
i'm
hoping
will
start
to
come
in
on
their
own
what
if
they
don't
should
i
panic
you'll
be
surprised
buffy
you're
the
youngest
and
uh
least
stuffy
member
of
this
faculty
i
think
the
students
are
gonna
want
to
come
in
and
talk
to
you
and
when
they
do
don't
evaluate
them
just
listen
they
need
to
feel
like
there's
someone
around
here
who
actually
understands
them
while
buffy
looks
out

window
nearest
her
cubicle
she
gets
an
exciting
idea
can
i
give
detention
ok
by
me
a
little
authority
can
be
a
wonderful
thing
just
remember
that
while
you
are
here
to
help
you're
not
here
to
be
their
friend
trust
me
you
open

door

will
eat
you
alive

it's

no

it
my
sparkling

maybe
you

i
don't
know
if
i

what
if

it
does
that
mean
i
have
to
be

what
if
i
give
up

i
go

what
if—
they
won't

you

who

mess—out
of
my
head
admitted
last
week
living
in
the
school
basement

disapprovingly
from

looking
shocked

second

just
forgot
to
mention

things
were
insane
in
the
basement
i
saved
your
life
we
can
discuss
this
later
sure
xander
tenderly
whatever
you
want
right
'cause
that
seems
to
be
the
only
time
you
let
us
in
buffy
whenever
you
want
now
in
fairness
to
buffy—
xander
shouting
shut
up
spike
nancy
again
looks
uncomfortable
at
being
there
for
this
scene
buffy
sighs
ok
guys
give
us
a
second
spike
turns
toward
the
foyer
again
and
buffy
follows
cut
to
33
int
foyer
at
buffy's
house
night
they
talk
near
the
front
door
do
not
start
by
saying
you're
sorry
i
didn't
come
here
to
atone
then
what
the
hell
do
you
want
i'm
here
to
help
you
help
me
what
i
was
hoping
you'd
tell
me
you're
the
slayer
spike
buffy
crosses
her
arms
over
her
chest
connected
to
the
visions
long
line
of
worthies
right
i'm
just
a
guy
with
his
ear
to
the
ground
and
even
i
can
feel
it
something's
coming
i
don't
know
what
exactly
but
something's
brewing
and
it's
so
big
ugly
and
damned
it
makes
you
and
me
look
like
little
bitty
puzzle
pieces
i
mean
if
i'm
wrong
say
so
lovely
no
hard
feelings
i'll
go
out
that
door
and
you
can
lock
it
behind
me
with
any
spell
you
like
so
am
i
wrong
everything
about
you
is
wrong
spike
spike
takes
this
as
his
cue
to
leave
and
begins
toward
the
door
he
stops
when
buffy
continues
but
something
is
coming
you're
gonna
need
some
help
since
when
did
you
become
the
champion
of
the
people
i
didn't
i'm
just
a
guy
who
can
lend
a
hand
if
you'll
let
me
ball's
in
your
court
slayer
cut
to
34
int
living
room
at
buffy's
house
night
everyone
who
was
there
before
is
still
in
the
living
room
except
now
they're
standing
buffy
comes
into
the
room
giving
orders
and
ready
to
go
she's
putting
on
her
jacket
ok
we're
gonna
split
two
pairs
whatever
this
creature
is
it's
burrowing
through
solid
ground
that
means
a
strength
and
power
that
we
don't
usually
deal
with
but
we
may
have
to
get
used
to
now
that
the
hellmouth
is
getting
all
perky
buffy
opens
the
weapons
chest
nancy
whispering
to
xander
shouldn't
we
call
the
police
or
something
and
tell
them
i'll
stop
interrupting
xander
take
nancy
home
drive
don't
walk
and
try
not
to
stop
'til
you
get
there
nancy
to
xander
is
your
girlfriend
always
this
commanding
who
buffy
oh
no
no
no
no
no
see
uh
i
mean
she's
a
girl
and
she's
a
friend
but
she's
not
my
girlfriend
xander
xander
turns
to
face
dawn
she
gestures
casually
brushing
a
finger
on
the
side
of
her
mouth
a
little
drool
he
turns
back
to
face
nancy
and
smiles
a
nervous
laugh
buffy
is
holding
a
large
dagger
and
a
flashlight
spike
and
i
will
check
out
the
scene
ok
in
the
biggest
way
i
am
not
loving
this
plan
xander
to
buffy
i
am
not
loving
spike
xander
whispering
he
tried
to
rape
you
and
he
failed
i
know
i
can
take
him
xander
take
nancy
home
spike
and
i
will
patrol
i'm
command
central
so
everybody
check
in
with
me
ok
i'll
be
here
doing
my
homework
but
the
other
one
sounded
cooler
buffy
to
dawn
be
safe
buffy
to
spike
let's
go
rightyo
then
buffy
leaves
the
room
spike
starts
to
follow
and
passes
dawn
who
speaks
to
him
with
a
serious
cold
glare
spike
you
sleep
right
you
vampires
you
sleep
yeah
what's
your
point
niblet
well
i
can't
take
you
in
a
fight
or
anything
even
with
a
chip
in
your
head
but
you
do
sleep
if
you
hurt
my
sister
at
all
touch
her
you're
gonna
wake
up
on
fire
cut
to
35
ext
neighborhood
street
night
buffy
and
spike
are
patrolling
looking
for
the
location
where
nancy's
dog
was
abducted
they
are
talking
without
a
lot
of
eye
contact
you're
awfully
quiet
wouldn't
know
what
to
say
fine
with
me
i
was
more
halfexpecting
to
get
an
earful
anyway
and
when
exactly
did
your
sister
get
unbelievably
scary
buffy
stops
walking
what
are
you
doing
spike
turns
to
look
her
in
the
eye
what
i
told
you
once
straight
up
i'm
here
to
help
and
that's
all
spike
changes
the
subject
and
turns
to
look
away
from
her
at
the
broken
sidewalk
think
this
here
is
our
spot
how'd
you
guess
i
don't
fancy
sticking
my
head
in
there
well
if
something
bites
it
off
that'd
be
a
clue
spike
looks
at
her
and
concedes
to
investigate
the
broken
sidewalk
further
he
bends
down
on
one
knee
with
the
flashlight
in
hand
to
look
inside
the
hole
so
what
happened
to
you
spike's
still
all
business
talking
while
looking
around
for
clues
when
you
saw
me
those
ghostly
types
in
the
school
basement
got
in
my
head
made
me
flatout
bugshaggin'
crazy
and
i'm
not
exactly
braggin'
about
it
but
they
were
stronger
than
i
was
made
me
see
things
do
things
he
stops
investigating
and
looks
her
in
the
eyes
and
how
come
you
never
told
anyone
that
you
saw
me
i
don't
know
i
guess
i
was
partly
hoping
you
were
some
kind
of
mirage
sorry
to
disappoint
not
your
fault
hold
the
torch
would
you
he's
holding
the
flashlight
toward
her
but
his
hand
and
fingers
are
covering
the
shaft
of
the
light
in
such
a
way
that
she
can't
take
it
from
him
without
touching
him
she
takes
it
from
him
and
when
they
touch
she
has
agonizing
flashbacks
of
screaming
and
struggling
during
the
attempted
rape
attack
he
made
on
her
back
in
episode
6x19
seeing
red
buffy
is
revolted
spike
is
concerned
look
this
us
working
together—it's
not
a
way
for
us
to
get
back
together
if
that's
what
you
want
it's
not
look
i
can't
blame
you
for
being
all
skittish
skittish
that's
not
a
word
i
would
use
for
it
you
tried
to
rape
me
i
don't
have
the
words
neither
do
i
i
can't
say
sorry
can't
use
forgive
me
all
i
can
say
is
buffy
i've
changed
i
believe
you
well
that's
something
i
just
don't
know
what
you've
changed
into
you
come
back
to
town
you
make
with
the
big
surprises
twice
i
don't
know
what
your
game
is
spike
but
i
know
there's
something
you're
not
telling
me
you're
right
there
is
spike
stands
but
we're
not
best
friends
anymore
so
too
bad
for
me
i'm
not
sharing
we've
been
through
things
the
end
of
the
world
and
back
i
can
be
useful
'cause
honestly
i've
got
nothing
better
to
do
make
use
of
me
if
you
want
spike
gesturing
to
the
sidewalk
nd
there's
nothing
here
just
a
bit
of
slime
mounds
of
displaced
dirt
and
such
whatever
our
beastie
is
he's
gone
spike
walks
off
alone
back
down
the
street
in
the
direction
from
which
they
came
cut
to
36
int
nancy's
building
night
xander
is
walking
nancy
to
the
front
door
of
her
building
she
unlocks
it
and
they
enter
boy
i
still
can't
believe
this
is
happening
i
mean
even
with
this
town's
reputation
for
you
know
unexplained
weirdness
xander
chuckles
right
sunnydale
come
for
the
food
stay
for
the
dismemberment
there's
good
food
well
thanks
nancy
clears
throat
and
that's
a
couple
of
levels
of
lameness
right
there
me
saying
thanks
after
everything
you've
done
for
me
tonight
well
you
could
slip
me
a
twenty
but
then
i'd
have
to
act
all
offended
got
it
so
um
you
think
i
might
instead
give
you
a
call
sometime
just
to
check
in
no
actually
i'm
hitting
on
you
even
better
i'm
very
listed
and
i'm
really
pushy
so
that
works
out
well
then
good
night
uh
nancy
the
ground
is
rumbling
and
shaking
i
just
got
a
swell
idea
run
the
glass
in
the
front
door
shatters
in
toward
them
nancy
screams
they
run
further
into
the
building
down
the
hallway
floor
tiles
are
shattering
and
bursting
up
from
the
ground
behind
them
as
they
flee
finally
they
go
up
some
stairs
at
the
end
of
the
hallway
and
fall
to
the
ground
the
monster
bursts
forth
from
the
floor
in
front
of
the
stairs
it's
a
long
pink
cylindrical
and
slightly
phallicshaped
creature
with
four
jaws
full
of
sharp
pointy
teeth
it's
roaring
and
screeching
and
its
jaws
are
snapping
as
it
lunges
for
xander
and
nancy
they
wait
it
out
together
and
finally
it
retreats
into
the
ground
you
ok
i
just
dumb
question
are
you
injured
are
you
hurt
i
don't
think
so
i
just—i
don't
think
i
can
take
any
more
of
this
two
attacks
in
the
same
night
i'm
starting
to
think
it's
not
coincidence
oh
sure
why
not
a
monster
trying
to
kill
me
it's
just
the
thing
that
was
missing
to
make
my
life
absolutely
perfect
uhh
ronnie
would
love
this
boy
right
who's
ronnie
oh
um
only
my
psycho
exboyfriend
that
i've
been
trying
to
get
rid
of
for
the
past
few
weeks
i
almost
prefer
the
monster
ronnie
was
um
trouble
uhhuh
and
i'm
just
curious

this
ronnie
guy
a
borrowing
money
kind
of
trouble
or
was
he
a
raising
demon
trouble
kind
of
guy
ronnie
he
couldn't
he
just
he
was
an
abusive
bastard

the
catchy
headline
and
he'd
just
show
up
even
after
you
know
the
feeling
that
you
get
when
your
ex
is
constantly
ruining
every
part
of
your
life
and
it
just
doesn't
stop
yes

you
get

painting
on

lit
with
moonlight
streaming
into

small
chapel

appears
to
be
a
medieval
painting
of
mary
holding
baby
jesus
and
standing
in
front
of
a
fringed
white
drape
zoom
down
to
buffy
walking
through

front
door
the
chapel
is
set
up
with
a
dozen
wooden
pews
arranged
on
either
side
of
a
central
aisle
there
is
a
large
simple
gothic
crucifix
at
the
front
of
the
chapel
that
can
be
seen
by
looking
directly
down
the
central
aisle
buffy
looks
around
there
are
three
stained
glass
arched
windows
on
each
sidewall
of
the
chapel
she
walks
forward
and
jumps
when
spike
speaks
to
her
from
the
shadows
behind
her
hello

the
hell
are

spike
is
barechested
holding
his
shirt
out
to

hide
no
more
mind
games
spike
spike
is
looking
down
at
the
ground
even
though
he
is
standing
right
in
front
of
her
no
more
mind
games
no
more
mind
buffy
reaches
for
his
chest
where
the
scars
seen
in
episode
7x01
lessons
are
healing
tell
me
what
happened
to
you

violently
and
looks
her
into
her
eyes

i
flesh

i
flesh
to
you
feed
on
flesh

nods
oh

flesh
then
solid
through
spike
starts
unzipping
his
pants
get
it
hard
service
the
girl
buffy
is
disgusted
and
smacks
his
hands
away
from
his
pants
stop
it
spike
reflexively
reaches
up
and
grabs
her
by
the
throat
buffy
grabs
his
shoulder
and
throws
him
across
the
room
spike
lands
on
top
of
some
pews
breaking
them
into
pieces
he
sits
up
a
little
propped
on
his
elbows
behind
him
right
girl
doesn't
want
to
be
serviced
because
there's
no
spark
ain't
we
in
a
soddin'
engine
spike's
looking
around
the
room
buffy
walks
over
to
him
spike
have
you
completely
lost
your
mind
spike
lucidly
well
yes
where've
you
been
all
night
you
thought
you
would
just
come
back
here
and
be
with
me
first
time
for
everything
this
is
all
you
get
i'm
listening
tell
me
what
happened
i
tried
to
find
it
of
course
find
what
the
spark
the
missing
the
piece
that
fit
that
would
make
me
fit
because
you
didn't
want
spike
starts
to
cry
god
i
can't
not
with
you
looking
spike
stands
and
walks
away
to
a
nearby
window
he
stands
there
mostly
in
shadow
his
body
directed
away
from
her
he
looks
back
over
his
shoulder
at
her
i
dreamed
of
killing
you
keeping
an
eye
on
him
buffy
bends
down
to
pick
up
a
large
splinter
from
the
broken
pews
at
her
feet
to
use
as
a
stake
if
necessary
spike
starts
pacing
i
think
they
were
dreams
so
weak
did
you
make
me
weak
thinking
of
you
holding
myself
and
spilling
useless
buckets
of
salt
over
your
ending
angel—he
should've
warned
me
he
makes
a
good
show
of
forgetting
but
it's
here
in
me
all
the
time
spike
walks
around
toward
her
from
behind
the
spark
i
wanted
to
give
you
what
you
deserve
and
i
got
it
they
put
the
spark
in
me
and
now
all
it
does
is
burn
buffy's
face
shows
shock
disbelief
and
finally
comprehension
your
soul
spike
laughs
bit
worse
for
lack
of
use
buffy
turns
to
face
him
you
got
your
soul
back
how
it's
what
you
wanted
right
spike
looking
at
the
ceiling
it's
what
you
wanted
right
spike
presses
his
fingers
to
his
temples
looks
down
and
walks
toward
the
altar
and—and
now
everybody's
in
here
talking
everything
i
dideveryone
i—
and
him
and
it
the
other
the
thing
beneath—beneath
you
it's
here
too
everybody
they
all
just
tell
me
go
go
spike
looks
back
over
his
shoulder
to
buffy
to
hell
why
why
would
you
do
that—
buffy
shame
on
you
why
does
a
man
do
what
he
mustn't
for
her
to
be
hers
to
be
the
kind
of
man
who
would
nev—
spike
looks
away
to
be
a
kind
of
man
spike
walks
toward
the
6foottall
crucifix
altarpiece
at
the
front
of
the
chapel
sounds
like
he's
quoting
something
she
shall
look
on
him
with
forgiveness
and
everybody
will
forgive
and
love
he
will
be
loved
spike's
standing
only
a
foot
away
from
the
crucifix
staring
at
it
so
everything's
ok
right
spike
sighs
spike
embraces
the
crucifix
resting
one
arm
over
each
side
of
the
cross
bar
and
resting
his
head
in
the
corner
of
the
vertex
his
body
is
sizzling
and
smoke
is
rising
from
where
it
touches
the
cross
can—can
we
rest
now
buffycan
we
rest
a
closeup
of
buffy's
face
shows
that
she
is
crying
now
from
where
she
stands
spike's
exhausted
body
hanging
limply
on
the
cross
resembles
jesus
except
the
view
is
of
spike's
back
blackout
