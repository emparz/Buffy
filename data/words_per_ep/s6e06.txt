will
xander's
vigorous
use
of
his
tongue
giles
removes
his
glasses
and
begins
to
clean
them
buffy
watches
this
with
an
expression
of
outrage
buffy
shocked

something
cut
to
a
closeup
of
anya's
hand
wearing
the
engagement
ring
another
hand
is
holding
hers
and
he
said
he

he
gave
me
this
pull
out
to
reveal
xander

extra
biodegradabley
in
a
couple
of
hours
poof

magic
when
you

fight
monsters
naturally
with
sticks
and
stones
don't
recommend
it
though
willow
drinking
from
a
cup
it's
different
how
becau
tara
sighs
because
you're
protecting
people
keeping
them
from
being
hurt

pretty
decorations
made

a
look
cut
to
xander
and
anya
in
the
summers
house
so
i
was
thinking
maybe
a
june

then
i
remembered
that
they
always
had
the
highest
percentage
of
calls
for
vengeance
we
see
that
xander
and
anya
are
standing
in
front
of
the
couch
talking
to
giles
and
buffy
who
are
sitting
on
the
couch
so
now
i'm
leaning
towards
as
soon
as
damn
possible
i
mean
mortal
life
being
so
short
we
gotta
get
in
as
much
marital
bliss
as
we
can
before
we
wither
and
die
xander
nods
but
he
looks
more
and
more
nervous
i
mean
there's
just
so
much
to
consider
though
i
mean
planning
the
wedding
and
and
new
cars
house
and
babies

have
to
plan
for
babies
or
they
just
run
roughshod
over
your
entire
existence
xander
nervously

gotta
know
what
to
call
'em
before

insulted
anya
stops
laughing

her
throat
giles
gives
buffy
a
look
buffy
to
giles
look
all
that
matters
is
that
they're
happy
buffy
to
anya
everything
else
is
thick
gravy
goodness
i
know
xander's
smile
looks
a
little
glazed
i
mean
i
am
the
luckiest
exdemon
in
the
world

mean
to
be
able
to
find
the
one
person
in
all
dimensions
that
i
was
meant
to
be
with
and
have
everything
work
out
exactly
as
i
dreamed
anya
xander
smiles
at
her
i
mean
how
often
does
the
universe
allow
that
to
happen
buffy
looks
a
little
pensive
cut
to
exterior
shot
of
the
summers
house
the
door
opens
revealing
xander
who
holds
it
open
for
buffy
then
follows
her
out

in
return
he
breaks
free
and
they
trade
some
more
punches
and
kicks
the
vamp
rushes
buffy
and
she
opens
the
car
door
to
block
him
he
punches
at
her
and
his
fist
shatters
the
car
window
he
swings
at
buffy
and
she
grabs
him
pulls
him
through
the
car
window
to
the
other
side
kicks
him
back
and
slams
the
car
door
on
his
head
he
dusts
buffy
turns
and
walks
off
cut
to
dawn
walking
slowly
through
the
forest
she
hears
a
noise
and
turns
nervous
she
continues
to
walk
backward
looking
around
very
scared
justin
suddenly
appears
behind
her
trick
or
treat
dawn
screams
runs
off
but
justin
grabs
her
by
the
back
of
her
his
jacket
and
pulls
her
to
the
ground
he
lands
on
top
of
her
straddling
her
holding
her
hands
down
give
me
something
good
to
eat
i
thought
you
really
liked
me
he
lets
go
of
her
hands
and
sits
up
a
little
still
straddling
her
i
do
and
you
like
me
too
dawn
sighs
nods
i
do
justin
leans
down
to
bite
her
dawn
looks
at
the
sky
suddenly
he
stops
gasps
and
turns
to
dust
we
see
the
stake
in
dawn's
hand
she
lies
there
looking
upset
cut
to
the
summers
house
xander
and
anya
are
preparing
to
leave
sorry
about
the
party
aah
don't
worry
about
it
it
gave
me
more
time
to
plan
the
bridal
shower
where
do
we
order
obscenely
muscular
male
strippers
anya
well
i'm
kidding

xander
exits
anya
mouths
at
buffy

spike
comes
up
behind
buffy

bugger
off
something
about
big
bads
not
venturing
far
from
their
crypts
on
halloween
good
fight
spike
nods
at
her
exits
buffy
watches
him
go
as
willow
comes
up
behind
her
so
uh
big
monster
mashing
sorry
we
missed
it
tara
comes
up
to
them
too
walks
past
willow
to
stand
beside
buffy
as
long
as
dawn's
all
right
yeah
that's
what's
tara
to
buffy
i
i
think
i'm
gonna
turn
in
good
night
tara
goes
up
the
stairs
willow
looks
concerned
tara
tara
willow
follows
tara
buffy
watches
them
go
in
background
we
can
see
dawn
sitting
by
herself
in
the
dining
room
giles
comes
up
and
watches
willow
and
tara
go
too
he's
holding
an
icepack
to
his
mouth
how's
your
face
giles
takes
the
icepack
away
from
his
face
oh
still
ruggedly
handsome
'grandpa'
indeed
giles
puts
the
ice
back
ow
buffy
looking
toward
dawn
she's
taking
it
pretty
hard
well
it's
not
surprising
still
we
can't
ignore
this
kind
of
behavior
something
needs
to
be
done
before
it
spins
out
of
control
buffy
nods
you're
right
i'm
glad
you're
here
to
take
care
of
it
don't
be
too
hard
on
her
okay
buffy
goes
up
the
stairs
giles
stares
after
her
in
surprise
then
he
turns
and
goes
reluctantly
into
the
dining
room
goes
over
to
dawn
takes
the
icepack
off
his
face
again
we
need
to
have
a
conversation
dawn
quietly
this
the
part
where
you
tell
me
you're
not
angry
just
disappointed
dawn
looks
anxiously
at
him
pretty
much
giles
tosses
the
icepack
onto
the
table
except
for
the
bit
about
not
being
angry
dawn
looks
scared
cut
to
willow
and
tara's
room
i
i'm
sorry
okay
it's
not
that
easy
we
see
tara
taking
throwpillows
off
the
bed
both
she
and
willow
wear
pajamas
well
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
reverse
time
and
take
it
back
willow
small
laugh
'cause
i
could
probably
tara
gives
her
a
grim
look
joke
i
don't
think
i
could
really
tara
angrily
you
know
what
can
can
we
not
do
this
now
i'm
tired
tara
gets
into
bed
okay
let's
just
forget
it
ever
happened
willow
goes
over
to
a
side
table
picks
up
a
small
piece
of
herb
with
a
couple
of
flowers
on
it
she
holds
it
in
her
palm
willow
softly
forget
a
flash
of
light
moves
across
the
herb
leaving
it
dead
and
wilted
willow
turns
off
the
light
goes
over
to
the
bed
and
turns
off
another
light
gets
into
bed
tara
smiles
giggles
ooh
your
feet
are
cold
better
warm
me
up
mmm
tara
snuggles
up
to
willow
this
is
how
every
day
should
always
end
and
start
and
all
the
stuff
in
the
middle
tara
kisses
willow's
cheek
willow
smiles
so
uh
you're
not
mad
'bout
what
willow
smiles
to
herself
and
closes
her
eyes
blackout
joss
whedon
and
marti
noxon
the
end
