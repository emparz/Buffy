sighs
buffy
to

if

simple
things
up
so
much
wolf
howl
opening
credits
act
i

open
on
exterior
shot
of
xander's
building
night
cut
to
inside
anya
xander
willow
and
tara
sit
around
the
table
do
you
think
she
walked
around
on
clouds
wearing
like
birkenstocks
and
played
a
harp
'cause
those
are
just
not
flattering
you
know
the
clonky
sandals
not
a
harp
anya
softly
i
mean
who
doesn't
look
good
with
a
harp
the
others
just
look
at
her
they
all
look
grim
what
i'm
just
saying
what
everyone's
thinking
anya
to
xander
right
baby
you
are
attractive
and
have
many
good
qualities
it's
totally
not
stupid
to
wonder
what
it
was
like
for
buffy
but
it
could
have
been
any
one
of
a
zillion
heavenly
dimensions
all
we
know
is
that
it
was
a
good
place
and
she
was
happy
there
and
we
took
her
away
from
that
we
wrecked
it
for
her
we
didn't
wreck
we
didn't
know
we
didn't
wanna
know
willow
tara
looks
sadly
at
her
we
were
so
selfish
i
was
so
selfish
xander
shakes
head
maybe
we
were
i
just
feel
weird
feeling
bad
that
my
friend's
not
dead
it's
too
mindboggling
so
i've
decided
to
simplify
the
whole
thing
me
like
buffy
buffy's
alive
so
me
glad
not
to
be
miss
psycho
pep
squad
but
we
have
got
to
stop
obsessing
about
what
we
did
and
start
trying
to
make
things
better
for
buffy
i'm
with
miss
psycho
pep
squad
ah
we
need
to
spend
more
time
with
her
just
hang
out
maybe
have
weekly
dinners
over
here
or
uh

book
club
short
books
videos

can
fix
it

but
as
you
recall

caressing
her
face
i
too
am
a
magic
shop
owner
true

my
intuition
says
that

much
the
magic
guy
and
more
of
a
paperwork
type
anya
giles
frowns
okay

it
to
seek
out
better
nobler
things

and
the
two
of
us
spike
gestures
from
buffy
to
himself
natural
enemies
thrown
together
to
stand
against
the
forces
of
darkness
utter
trust
no
thought
of
me
biting
you
no
thought
of
you
staking
me
depends
on
how
long
you
keep
on
yapping
sound
of
growling
they
both
turn
to
see
four
vampires
striding
toward
them
spike
and
buffy
move
closer
to
each

the
four
scoobies
running
tara
is
in
the

she
looks
to
her
left
sees
a

sensible
for
me
to
go
down
into
that
pit
of
cottontop
hell
and
let

hippityhop
all
over
my
vulnerable
flesh
fine

three
years
were
just
pretend
and
i
said
cut
to
the
summers
house
tara
takes
a
pile
of
clothing
from
the
cabinet
turns
looks
around
goodbye
to
you
goodbye
to
everything
that
i
knew
tara
walks
over
to
the
bed
puts
the
clothes
in
a
cardboard
box
sitting
there
she
glances
toward
the
door
starts
to
cry
cut
to
a
long
shot
of
willow
sitting
on
the
floor
in
buffy's
room
with
her
knees
pulled
up
to
her
chest
you
were
the
one
i
loved
the
one
thing
that
i
tried
to
hold
on
to
cut
to
a
closer
shot
of
willow
then
even
closer
she
stares
ahead
sadly
cut
back
to
tara
folding
and
packing
her
clothes
guitar
music
continues
cut
back
to
the
bronze
close
shot
on
the
singer
as
she
starts
the
second
verse
i
used
to
get
lost
in
your
eyes
and
it
seems
that
i
can't
live
a
day
without
you
fade
to
giles
sitting
on
the
plane
surrounded
by
other
passengers
he
stares
off
in
front
of
him
closin'
my
eyes
you
chase
my
thoughts
away
to
a
place
where
i
am
blinded
by
the
light
but
it's
not
right
goodbye
to
you
cut
back
to
willow
still
sitting
crying
goodbye
to
everything
that
i
knew
you
were
the
one
i
loved
the
one
thing
that
i
tried
cut
back
to
buffy
in
the
bronze
to
hold
on
to
spike
walks
up
beside
buffy
she
looks
over
at
him
he
looks
at
her
questioningly
buffy
turns
her
face
away
from
spike
breathes
deeply
as
if
trying
to
hold
back
tears
spike
looks
frustrated
walks
away
fade
back
to
the
band
onstage
and
it
hurts
to
want
everything
and
nothing
at
the
same
time
i
want
what's
yours
and
i
want
what's
mine
the
song
pauses
for
a
moment
then
resumes
i
want
you
but
i'm
not
giving
in
this
time
goodbye
to
you
cut
to
the
summers
house
tara
walking
down
the
stairs
holding
a
box
the
front
door
of
the
house
is
open
she
walks
out
onto
the
porch
goodbye
to
everything
that
i
knew
dawn
is
on
the
porch
leaning
against
a
post
tara
puts
her
box
on
top
of
another
reaches
out
to
dawn
but
before
she
can
touch
her
dawn
turns
and
runs
back
inside
you
were
the
one
i
loved
the
one
thing
that
i
tried
to
hold
on
to
tara
watches
dawn
go
looks
sad
cut
to
willow
still
sitting
and
crying
the
one
thing
that
i
tried
to
hold
on
to
cut
to
giles
on
the
plane
cut
to
the
bronze
pan
across
various
couples
walking
around
holding
hands
talking
etc
goodbye
to
you
pan
around
the
stairs
and
we
discover
spike
and
buffy
standing
underneath
the
stairs
kissing
goodbye
to
everything
that
i
knew
buffy
pulls
back
for
a
moment
then
resumes
kissing
spike
you
were
the
one
i
loved
blackout
joss
whedon
and
marti
noxon
the
end
