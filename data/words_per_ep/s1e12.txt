his
throat
y'know
buffy
spring
fling
just
isn't
any
dance
it's
a
time
for

observe
their
mating
rituals
and
tag
them
before
they
migrate
just
kill
me
you're
doing
fine
why's
it
so
hard

up
to
her
and
say
'hey

go
to
the
dance
together'
willow

what's
she
doing
oh
you
know
the
usual
cut
to
the
park
a
car
is
parked
in
the
distance
with
its
windows
all
fogged
up
buffy
comes
falling
into
the
field
of
view
in
slow
motion
and
hits
the
ground
hard
on
her
back
and
exhales
cut
inside
the
car
cordelia
breaks
off
her
kiss
with
kevin
what
was
that
what
was
what
cut
outside
buffy
props
herself
up
a
vampire
approaches
her
and
growls
cut
inside
the
car
someone's
out
there
that's
silly
who
would
be
out
there
cut
outside
buffy
rolls
in
a
reverse
somersault
and
comes
up
standing
ready
to
fight
the
vampire
growls
at
her
she
pulls
a
stake
out
from
under
her
jacket
behind
her
back
and
holds
it
pointing
out
from
her
hips
so
the
vampire
can
see
he
frowns
at
the
sight
of
it
as
buffy
puts
on
an
evil
smile
this
infuriates
the
vampire
and
he
launches
himself
at
her
she
hits
him
with
an
outtoin
crescent
kick
and
then
follows
up
with
a
high
front
snap
kick
stunning
him
she
immediately
plunges
the
stake
home
and
he
falls
over
backward
and
bursts
into
ashes
when
he
hits
the
ground
three
in
one
night
giles
would
be
so
proud
cut
to
the
roof
of

gets
up
and
goes
into
his
office
to
make
some
tea
cut
to
giles'
office
he
sits
down
at
his
desk
with
his
cup
of

phanaytie
toutay
tay
nuktee
'the
master

is

the
slayer'
giles
looks
up
in
disbelief
my
god
he
considers
what
he's
just
read
for
a
moment
and
then
reaches
for
his
tea
the
cup
begins
to
jiggle
and
he
looks
at
it
curiously
a
few
seconds
later
the
whole
building
begins
to
shake
and
he
realizes
he's
experiencing
his
first
earthquake
he
gets
up
and
looks
around
at
everything
shaking
his
teacup
vibrates
off
of
the
desk
and
smashes
to
pieces
on
the
floor

xander
grabs
willow
and
guides
her
away
under
the

get
under
the
stairs
and
willow
grabs
onto
a
step
from
underneath
to
steady
herself
someone
rushing
down
the
stairs
nearly
steps
on
her
fingers
and
she
yelps
as
she
pulls
her
hand
back
cut
to
cordelia's
car
she
and
kevin
hold
on
as
they
ride

at

going
off
everywhere
cut
to
the
library
giles

out
of

she
looks
at

in
the
mirror
and
absently
turns
on
the
water
after
looking
in
the
mirror
another
moment

looks
down
and

i
let

darkness
in

thinking
joyce

over
to
buffy's
closet
well
then

the
best
time
for
this
but
uh
she
opens
the
closet
to
reveal
a
beautiful
white
sleeveless
gown
i
saw
you
eyeing

we
can
afford
it
buffy
comes

men
i
don't

up
with
them
i

ya
cut

door
from

room
kevin
is
sitting
on
the
floor
leaning
against
it
the
room
is
trashed
and
the
boys
are
all
dead
obviously
kevin
has
underestimated
the
power
of
my
icy
stare
she
opens
the
door
and
kevin's
body
falls
out
into
the
hall
he
has
a
vampire
bite
on
his
neck
cordelia
screams
oh
my
god
kevin
cordelia
kneels
by

no
willow
looks
up
and
slowly
goes
into
the
room
she
sees
the
death
and
devastation
kevin
there's
a
bloody
handprint
on
the
tv
screen
cut
to
buffy's
room
she's
wearing
her
new
white
prom
gown
and
is
looking
at
herself
in
the
mirror
her
mom
comes
rushing
in
buffy
there's
something
on
the
news
willow
cut
to
a
view
of
the
sunset
i've
seen
so
much
cut
to
her
room
she's
on
the
bed
hugging
her
knees
she's
been
crying
i
thought
i
could
take
anything
but
buffy
this
this
was
different
it'll
be
alright
i'm
trying
to
think
how
to
say
it
to
explain
it
so
you
understand
it
doesn't
matter
as
long
as
you're
okay
i'm
not
okay
i
knew
those
guys
i
go
to
that
room
every
day
and
when
i
walked
in
there
it
it
wasn't
our
world
anymore
they
made
it
theirs
and
they
had
fun
willow
a
tear
rolls
down
her
cheek
what
are
we
gonna
do
what
we
have
to
buffy
gets
up
and
exhales
promise
me
you'll
stay
in
tonight
okay
willow
nods
buffy
starts
to
go
buffy
buffy
stops
and
turns
back
willow
smiles
through
her
tears
i
like
your
dress
buffy
looks
down
at
it
and
smiles
weakly
then
looks
back
up
take
care
buffy
leaves
willow
looks
down
sadly
and
stays
on
her
bed
cut
to
the
master's
lair
he
tests
his
confines
as
collin
watches
soon
he
sends
collin
on
his
way
to
get
buffy
collin
climbs
up
to
the
exit
soon
cut
to
the
library
giles
is
getting
weapons
out
of
the
cage
and
prepares
them
okay
so
this
master
guy
tried
to
open
the
hellmouth
but
he
got
stuck
in
it
and
now
all
the
signs
are
reading
that
he's
gonna
get
out
which
opens
the
hellmouth
which
brings
the
demons
which
ends
the
world
yes
that
about
sums
it
up
yes
the
part
that
gets
me
though
is
where
buffy
is
the
vampire
slayer
she's
so
little
you
know
how
to
get
in
touch
with
this
uh
brother
luca
chap
hmm
as
far
as
i
can
tell
no
one
can
he's
disappeared
did
send
out
one
last
global
though
a
short
one
what
did
it
say
isaiah
116
which
i
dutifully
looked
up
'the
wolf
shall
live
with
the
lamb
the
leopard
shall
lie
down
with
the
kid
the
calf
the
lion
and
the
fatling
together
and
the
little
child
to
lead
them'
ms
calendar
that's
kinda
warm
and
fuzzy
for
a
message
of
doom
well
that
depends
where
he's
leading
them
to
aurelius
wrote
of
the
anointed
one
'the
slayer
will
not
know
him
and
he
will
lead
her
into
hell'
ms
calendar
so
luca
thinks
the
anointed
is
a
kid
if
the
vampire
that
buffy
killed
was
in
fact
not
the
anointed
then
it
may
well
be
well
then
we
need
to
warn
her
i
don't
intend
involving
her
at
all
what
do
you
mean
buffy's
not
gonna
face
the
master
i
am
no
you're
not
giles
and
ms
calendar
look
over
and
see
her
approaching
so
i'm
looking
for
a
kid
huh
and
he'll
lead
me
to
the
master
buffy
i'm
not
gonna
send
you
out
there
to
die
now
you
were
right
ii've
waded
around
in
these
old
books
for
so
long
i've
forgotten
what
the
real
world
is
like
iit's
time
i
found
out
you're
still
not
going
up
against
the
master
i've
made
up
my
mind
so
have
i
i
made
up
my
mine
first
i'm
older
and
wiser
than
you

what
you're
told
for
once
alright
that's
not
how
it
goes
i'm
the
slayer
i
don't
care
what
the
books
say
i
defy
prophecy
and
i
am
going
there's
nothing

can
say

change
my
mind
i
know
she
pretends
to
turn
to
go
but
then
throws
a
hard
punch
to
his
face
knocking
him
out
he
falls
backward
to
the
floor
ms
calendar
scrambles
to
his
aid
buffy
sees
her
cross
on
the
table
and
puts
it
back
on
ms
calendar
lifts
giles'
head
in
her
hands
and
gets
under

with
her
knees
she
looks
up
at
buffy

him
i
don't
know
think
of
something
cool

said
it

the
master
and
you'll
die
maybe
buffy
picks
up
the
crossbow
maybe
i'll
take
him
with
me
she
leaves
the
library
ms
calendar

her
attention

no
telling
how
powerful
he'll
be
if

reaches
the
surface

bolt
in
the
direction

catches
it
in

coming
they
will
be
his
army
do
you
think
they'll
gather
at
the
hellmouth
well
the
last
time
the
master
tried
to
rise
was
the
harvest
he
sent
a
bunch
of
vampires
to
get
him
fresh
blood
well
where
did
that
go
down

the
master's
lair
buffy
is
slowly
walking
around
searching
for
the
master
she
comes
upon
a
dead
and
rotted
body
she
continues
her
search

waiting
for
you
i

this
moment
to
last

she
searches
for
a
few
moments
longer
then
the
master
suddenly
comes
to
stand
right
behind
her
i
understand
she
turns
around
and
the
master
knocks
the
crossbow
out
of
her
hands
he
grabs
her
by
the
neck
cut
to
the
school
parking
lot

in
her
bag
for
