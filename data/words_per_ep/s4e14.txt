prologue

fadein
to
giles'
apartment
same
as
at
the
end
of
the
'i'
in
team
buffy
is
pacing
giles
is
standing
close
by
willow
is
sitting
at
his
desk
spike
is
sitting
on
the
bottom
steps
of
the
stairs
and
anya
and
xander
are
sitting
on
giles'
weapons
trunk
against
the
wall
buffy
is
in
the
middle
of
telling
them
what
just
happened
so
maggie
sends
me
down
into
the
sewers
with
one
of
those
blastoguns
and
the
next
thing
i
know
it's
raining
monsters
xander
without
humor
hallelujah
and
then
this
gate
slams
down
behind
me
and
i
try
to
use
the
gun
but
it
goes
phitt
giles
you're
saying
that
maggie
walsh
set
you
up
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying
she
sent
me
on
a
wayone
recon
gotta
hand
it
to
you
goldilocks
you
do
have
bleeding
tragic
taste
in
men
i
got
a
cousin
married
to
a
regurgitating
frovalox
demon
that's
got
better
instincts
than
you
buffy
glaring
at
him
what
does
my
taste
in
men
have
to
do
with
this
do
you
think
riley
was
out
knitting
booties
for
your
future
offspring
while
maggie
was
stringing
you
up
buffy
looks
at
everyone
else's
expressions
they
don't
say
anything
but
she
can
see
from
their
faces

you
guys
think
riley
had
something
to
do
with
this
probably
not
but
uh
we'd
be
remiss
if
we
didn't
think
of
all
the
possibilities
buffy
softly
right
remiss
she's
turning
away
then
suddenly
faces
him
again
no
no
maggie
made
sure
he
was
no
where
around
when
she
sent
me
on
this
very
special
make
buffy
dead
assignment
and
plus
riley
he
seems
like
he
wouldn't
tell
a
little
white
lie
let
alone
a
whole
bunch
of
big
dirty
ones
that's
why
they
call
it
the
secret
forces
will
'cause
they
kinda
keep
the
whole
lying
thing
to
themselves
all
i
know
is
that
maggie
has
it
in
for
me
which
means
the
initiative
has
it
in
for
me
i'm
guessing
the
mad
scientist
isn't
too
keen
on
the
fact
that
the
entire
scooby
gang
knows
that
the
initiative
is
up
to
no
good
which
brings
us
back
to
the
not
safe
for
any
of
us
concept
what
could
have
happened
to
make
professor
walsh
want
to
kill
you
buffy
at
a
loss
i
don't
know
uh
she
wasn't
keen
on
the
fact
that
i
was
asking
a
lot
of
questions
that's
for
sure
so
you
were
getting
too
close
to
something
clearly
although
one
can
only
imagine
what
she'd
be
so
desperate
to
hide
cut
to
deep
in
the
woods
all
is
quiet
with
the
peaceful
sounds
of
birds
and
other
forest
noises
pan
to
a
concrete
access
tunnel
just
visible
from
the
side
of
the
hill
it
doesn't
look
as
if
it's
been
used
for
sometime
as
the
metal
doors
screech
as
they
are
opened
from
the
inside
close
up
on
a
pair
of
army
boots
walking
down
the
steps
from
the
entrance
as
the
shot
pans
up
see
legs
clad
in
camouflage
commando
pants
and
the
left
leg
is
in
a
metal
brace
jointed
at
the
knee
from
ankle
to
midthigh
he's
not
wearing
a
shirt
and
his
flesh
is
a
jigsaw
of
different
skin
types
and
there
is
an
electronic
metal
plate
over
the
left
side
of
his
chest
his
face
is
mostly
green
except
for
the
patch
of
pale
human
flesh
around
his
right
blue
eye
and
ear
his
left
eye
is
a
demonic
red
color
his
short
hair
is
a
normal
brown
but
there
is
a
metal
plating
that
frames
the
left
green
side
of
his
face
and
wraps
around
to
the
back
of
his
head
outside
for
the
first
time
adam
looks
at
his
surroundings
wolf's
howl
buffy
theme
and
credits
roll
part
one

fade
in
to
giles'
apartment
buffy
has
giles'
trunk
opened
and
is
taking
out
weapons
okay
everybody
grab
a
weapon
we
gotta
move
she
hands
xander
a
battle
ax
and
gives
anya
a
bat
with
a
fisherman's
hook
attached
to
the
head
and
storm
the
initiative
xander
bravado
yeah
let's
take
on
those
suckers
i
was
thinking
more
that
we'd
hide
xander
relieved
oh
thank
god
buffy
i
think
perhaps
we
should
talk
about
this
we
need
to
relocate
some
place
where
we're
less
likely
to
be
found
we
need
to
come
up
with
a
plan
we
could
go
to
my
place
willow
she
is
holding
a
wicked
looking
flail
the
initiative
guys
know
how
close
we
are
they'll
automatically
check
the
places
you
hang
out
xander
what
about
your
basement
the
guys
haven't
seen
us
together
that
much
and
there's
enough
room
willow
smiles
oh
plus
mirror
ball
cool
come
on
down
and
boogie
at
xander's
hideaway
anya
not
happy
yes
come
boogie
absolutely
not
i
will
not
squat
in
that
dank
whole
what
it
was
good
enough
for
me
but
you're
above
it
all
precisely
giles
sits
down
at
his
desk
besides
i
don't
see
why
we
can't
stay
right
where
we
are
giles
chuckles
because
it's
very
unlikely
those
initiative
boys
are
gonna
come
around
here
looking
for
the
front
door
opens
and
riley
steps
inside
buffy
everybody
looks
at
him
in
surprise
riley
closes
the
door
and
rushes
over
to
buffy
god
buffy
are

happened
buffy
a
beat
you

i
know
something
went
down

to
kill

a
moment

helpfully

all
upset
anyway

i
need
you
to
go
over
everything

of
mistake

no
mistake

how
do
you

i
was
on
a
mission
but
i
came
back
and
i'm
not
sure
look

just
keep
our
heads
and
not
jump
to
any
he
looks
over
his
shoulder
and
sees
spike
sitting
on
the
stairs
spike
looks
away
riley
takes
a
step
back
in
surprise
as
he
faces
the
vampire
what
that's
hostile
17

really
long
story

what
i
am
a
bleeding
broken
record
i'm
bad
it's
just
i
can't
bite
anymore
thanks
to
you
wankers
riley
exasperated
we've
been
looking
all
over
the
place
for
him
but
you've
known
where
he's
been
all
along
it's
not
like
that
then
what
is
it
like
what's
he
doing
here
leaving
you
swabs
to
your
dramatics
thanks
he
walks
over
to
the
door
and
grabs
his
leather
duster
spike
putting
it
on
i've
got
my
stories
on
the
telly
for
that
by
the
by
if
you're
trying
to
kill
her

spike
gives
riley
two
very
enthusiastic
thumbs
up
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
he
turns
and
pulls
his
coat
over
his
head
he
opens
the
door
and
runs
outside
buffy
what
is
this
you're
hiding
an
hst
why
don't
you
just
back
off
and
let
her
ask
the
questions
jack
your
boss
just
tried
to
make
monster
food
out
of
her
riley
sees
everyone
looking
at
him
and
calms
down
ii
didn't
see
much
i
wasn't
there
i
all
i
know
is
professor
walsh
told
me
you
were
dead
but
then
i
saw
you
on
the
monitors
look
this
isn't
professor
walsh
there
must
be
something
making
her
act
this
way
something
i
i
don't
know
controlling
her
we
think
buffy
may
have
been
becoming
too
in
inquisitive
that
she
was
getting
close
to
something
that
professor
walsh
was
trying
to
hide
any
idea
what
that
might
be
what
about
314
maybe
that's
it
maybe
she
was
trying
to
test
you
what
if
it
was
only
a
drill
then
why
did
she
tell
you
i
was
dead
riley
it
wasn't
a
test
see
i've
heard
rumors
that
the
initiative
wasn't
all
that
we've
been
told
that
uh
secretly
they're
working
towards
some
darker
purpose
something
that
might
harm
us
all
no
that's
that's
not
what
happens
there
riley
i
would
know
look
no
one
is
sure
of
anything
okay
we're
just
trying
to
sort
it
out
i
can't
be
here
i'll
sort
it
out
on
my
own
riley
heads
for
the
door
buffy
going
after
him
riley
no
just
i'm
sorry
he
opens
the
door
and
is
gone
cut
to
the
woods
again
close
up
of
a
small
boy
sitting
next
to
his
bike
he
is
playing
with
a
cyborg
soldier
action
figure
on
the
rise
behind
him
the
back
of
a
house
can
be
seen
not
far
away
but
it
appears
as
if
he's
the
only
one
outside
right
now
until
adam
sees
the
him
despite
his
size
the
boy
doesn't
notice
adam
until
he
is
standing
just
a
few
feet
away
the
boy
looks
up
and
smiles
with
a
cool
expression
on
his
face
what
am
i
boy
standing
you're
a
monster
adam
nodding
i
thought
so
what
are
you
me
i'm
a
boy
adam
curious
a
boy
how
do
you
work
i
don't
know
i
just
do
the
boy
sees
something
and
points
what's
that
for
adam
looks
down
and
raises
his
polgara
left
arm
where
just
the
sharp
tip
of
the
bone
skewer
sheathed
inside
the
forearm
is
visible
under
his
wrist
adam
looks
at
the
boy
and
a
let
me
show
you
smile
slowly
spreads
across
his
grotesque
face
cut
to
uc
sunnydale
at
night
riley
is
walking
across
campus
without
a
clear
destination
brooding
cut
to
the
initiative
lab
314
dr
angleman
opens
the
door
to
the
dark
lab
and
flips
the
light
switch
the
lights
stay
off
and
he
flips
it
on
and
off
a
couple
times
but
they
remain
off
dr
walsh
angleman
worried
whisper
adam
slowly
he
starts
walking
across
the
lab
but
his
feet
slip
out
from
under
him
and
he
falls
to
the
floor
he's
pushing
himself
up
when
he
notices
something
wet
on
his
hands
he
sees
they're
covered
with
blood
then
notices
the
trail
of
blood
leading
to
the
body
of
professor
walsh
lying
face
down
on
the
floor
angleman
freaks
scrambles
to
his
feet
and
runs
out
of
the
lab
cut
to
xander's
basement
it
is
morning
close
up
of
the
disco
mirror
ball
hanging
from
the
ceiling
cut
to
giles
lying
on
an
inflated
beach
chair
he's
waking
up
and
squints
his
eyes
against
the
dots
of
light
the
mirror
ball
is
shining
in
his
face
he
rubs
a
hand
on
his
forehead
obviously
a
good
night's
sleep
he
didn't
get
sounds
of
the
road
runner
can
be
heard
as
the
camera
pans
the
basement
there
is
an
empty
sleeping
bag
on
the
floor
next
to
giles
two
blankets
hanging
from
the
clothesline
divides
the
basement
in
half
on
the
other
half
see
willow
anya
and
buffy
in
that
order
still
under
the
covers
in
the
foldout
bed
watching
tv
where
the
selfproclaimed
wile
e
coyote
is
killing
himself
again
with
another
one
of
his
shoddy
acme
traps
that
backfires
on
him
willow
finds
this
funny
buffy
unmoved
that
would
never
happen
well
no
buff
that's
why
they
call
them
cartoons
not
documentaries
giles
steps
through
the
draped
blankets
and
shuts
off
the
tv
must
we
have
the
noise
my
head
is
splitting
he's
returning
to
the
other
side
of
the
basement
willow
smiling
well
look
who's
cranky
bear
in
the
morning
yes
i
can't
imagine
why
i
didn't
sleep
well
in
my
beach
ball
every
time
you
moved
it
made
squeaky
noises
it
was
irritating
really
i'm
surprised
you
could
hear
it
over
your
wagnerian
snoring
okay
you
guys
could
we
not
please
everything's
screwed
up
enough
without
you
two
doing
scenes
from
my
parents'
marriage
anya
a
beat
sorry
sorry
thank
you
giles
disappears
through
the
blankets
it'll
be
okay
buffy
riley's
just
confused
that's
all
i
don't
know
it
just
seems
like
things
can
get
heavier
his
whole
world's
falling
apart
and
after
everything
you've
been
through
with
angel
you
know
you
really
should
get
yourself
a
boring
boyfriend
anya
smiles
like
xander
anya
then
you
can't
have
xander
that
was
the
idea
riley
was
supposed
to
be
mr
joe
guy
we
were
gonna
do
dumb
things
like
hold
hands
through
the
daisies
going
tra
la
la
poor
buffy
your
life
resists
all
things
average
so
dump
him
anya
sternly
but
you
can't
have
xander
i'll
try
and
remember
that
buffy
pause
it's
too
late
anyway
i'm
already
at
the
i
hurt
when
he
hurts
i
smile
when
he
smiles
stage
anya
whispers
i
hate
that
part
i'll
just
have
to
make
it
work
xander
hurries
down
the
stairs
into
the
basement
carrying
a
breakfast
tray
turn
on
the
tv
now
willow
gets
up
to
switch
the
tv
back
on
the
news
is
on
sunnydale
is
still
reeling
from
news
of
the
crime
giles
peeks
out
from
the
blankets
brushing
his
teeth
a
source
in
the
coroner's
office
tells
us
that
the
boy
was
stabbed
with
what
looks
like
some
kind
of
large
skewer
and
his
body
was
then
mutilated
police
have
not
named
a
suspect
and
the
killer
is
still
at
large
realization
fills
buffy's
expression
as
she
listens
the
polgara
demon
had
a
skewer
in
its
arm
that's
the
one
maggie
insisted
we
bring
back
alive
giles
mouthful
of
toothpaste
she
must
have
sent
it
after
you
and
it
got
distracted
buffy
looks
away
god
buffy
it's
not
your
fault
how
could
you
know
she's
right
you
mustn't
blame
yourself
buffy
a
beat
i'm
not
going
to
as
she
gets
out
of
bed
cue
badass
chris
beck
score
she
faces
them
with
a
determined
expression
i'm
going
to
the
crime
scene
to
see
what
i
can
find
out
you
guys
research
the
polgara
demon
i
want
to
know
where
it
is
when

am
going
to

for
taking
that
kid's
life
i'll
make
him
die
in
ways
he
can't
even
imagine
badass
score
dies
and
everyone
just
looks
at
her
seemingly
unmoved
by
her
passionate
speech
buffy
notices
their
looks
and
glances
down
at
the
weird
pattern
on
her
pajamas
that
probably
would
have
sounded
more
commanding
if
i
wasn't
wearing
my
yummy
sushi
pajamas
cut
to
lowell
house
riley
has
just
walked
in
and
is
heading
for
his
room
forrest
gates
spots
him
and
catches
up
with
him
on
the
stairs
hey
where
you
been
all
night
riley
doesn't
answer
forrest
smiles
well
congratulations
i
see
you
and
buffy
have
finally
gotten
past
the
shy
phase
forrest
raises
a
fist
for
riley
to
knuckle
but
riley
leaves
him
hanging
he's
still
in
brooding
mode
i
wasn't
with
buffy
i
needed
to
be
alone
think
some
things
through
what
things
in
the
hall
now
riley
turns
to
face
him
then
reconsiders
and
motions
him
to
follow
him
into
his
room
forrest
stepping
inside
this
is
mighty
ominous
what's
up
man
professor
walsh
tried
to
have
buffy
killed
what
did
buffy
tell
you
that
i
mean
do
you
have
any
proof
i
saw
enough
to
know
it's
true
i
don't
get
it
why
i
don't
know
riley
paces
across
the
room
buffy
thinks
that
she's
getting
too
close
to
something
that
professor
walsh
has
some
secret
i
wouldn't
put
it
past
buffy
to
get
on
professor
walsh's
bad
side
she
tends
to
put
her
nose
where
it
doesn't
belong
what
forrest
angry
she's
a
pain
always
wanting
to
know
why
this
and
why
that
riley
exasperated
and
you're
saying
she
should
die
because
of
that
i
don't
know
maybe
professor
walsh
found
out
that
buffy
was
up
to
something
bad
that
ever
cross
your
mind
why
does
it
bug
you
so
much
that
i'm
hanging
with
her
is
it
because
she's
a
better
soldier
than
you
it
bugs
me
that
she's
using
you
to
infiltrate
our
operations
riley
raising
voice
so
you're
saying
she's
a
spy
you're
crazy
riley
turns
away
riley
think
about
it
the
professor
is
not
stupid
if
she
tried
to
kill
buffy
maybe
buffy
needed
killing
behind
forrest
the
door
opens
and
graham
miller
steps
inside
guys
not
now
graham
graham's
usually
calm
stoic
face
seems
a
bit
forced
what
is
it
graham
deep
breath
professor
walsh
is
dead
forrest
takes
this
news
and
looks
at
riley
off
riley's
shocked
expression
fade
to
commercial
part
two

fade
in
on
the
initiative
riley
rounds
a
corner
quickly
and
pushes
his
way
to
the
open
door
of
lab
314
he
sees
professor
walsh
lying
on
the
floor
while
two
other
scientists
are
looking
over
her
body
forrest
steps
up
besides
him
and
sees
this
and
has
to
look
away
for
a
moment
forrest
steely
look
at
that
wound
she's
been
staked
wouldn't
you
say
brother
what
only
one
person
i
can
think
of
who
could
do
something
like
that
riley
warning
tone
you
better
not
be
saying
what
i
think
you're
saying
riley
steps
out
into
the
corridor
forrest
follows
him
and
riley
faces
him
wewe
don't
know
that
a
person
did
this
the
polgara
demon
has
a
skewer
that
comes
right
out
of
forrest
angrily
no
way
that's
your
girlfriend's
mo
riley
grabs
a
fistful
of
forrest's
shirt
hey
that's
a
serious
accusation
you
better
be
ready
to
deal
with
the
consequences
forrest
shoves
riley
back
then
bring
'em
on
that
supernatural
freak
has
blinded
you
and
i'm
sick
of
it
riley
advancing
that's
enough
angleman
steps
in
between
them
stand
back
show
some
respect
listen
everybody's
upset
but
arguing
isn't
going
to
help
anything
and
it's
certainly
not
what
professor
walsh
would
want
riley
and
forrest
keep
i'm
gonna
kick
your
ass
eye
contact
for
a
few
more
seconds
then
break
off
no
sir
riley
takes
a
couple
of
steps
back
all
right
good
now
washington
is
sending
in
a
team
to
do
an
internal
investigation
i've
been
told
we
have
to
wait
for
their
word
what
do
you
mean
wait
this
has
to
be
the
work
of
the
polgara
demon
we
captured
last
week
probably
looks
like
last
night
the
polgara
escaped
through
tunnel
seventytwo
it's
out
loose
somewhere
i'm
afraid
so
then
we
have
to
go
after
it
riley
starts
to
walk
off
but
angleman
stops
him
my
orders
from
washington
are
for
a
total
lockdown
until
they
arrive
i'm
sorry
now
return
to
your
quarters
there's
nothing
you
can
do
here
riley
is
silent
then
nods
satisfied
angleman
walks
off
when
he
disappears
around
the
corner
riley
turns
to
graham
and
a
few
other
commandos
standing
nearby
listen
angleman
can
talk
all
he
wants
but
i'm
still
in
charge
until
the
brass
gets
here
and
tells
me
otherwise
i
say
we
got
a
demon
to
hunt
riley
absently
scratches
the
back
of
his
right
hand
now
suit
up
for
armed
patrol
and
by
that
i
mean
loaded
guns
man
target
practice
is
over
we're
going
for
blood
they
head
off
to
follow
their
orders
forrest
looks
at
riley
but
doesn't
say
anything
as
he
walks
past
him
to
follow
the
others
riley
glances
once
more
into
the
lab
before
following
as
well
cut
to
cemetery
daylight
two
humvees
pull
up
and
commandos
fully
armed
start
storming
the
mausoleums
forrest
and
graham
head
toward
a
mausoleum
cut
to
interior
of
spike's
place
don't
see
him
inside
and
forrest
and
graham
enter
rifles
ready
somebody's
been
staying
here
what
do
think
a
homeless
guy
forrest
moving
deeper
into
the
chamber
could
be
or
a
squatter
of
the
demon
variety
but
not
the
polgara
forrest
faces
him
who
cares
i
see
a
demon
it
dies
there
is
a
tv
set
up
on
a
stone
bench
graham
puts
a
palm
on
top
of
it
it's
warm
forrest
glances
at
the
sarcophagus
and
he
and
graham
move
to
either
end
slinging
their
rifles
together
they
raise
the
stone
lid
and
lean
it
against
the
side
inside
they
see
an
old
decayed
skeleton
with
its
arms
folded
over
its
chest
covered
in
an
old
blanket
unslinging
there
rifles
they
head
for
the
door
again
damn
forrest
is
passing
the
tv
and
he
shatters
the
screen
with
the
stock
of
his
rifle
animals
hear
them
leave
and
cut
to
a
close
up
of
inside
the
sarcophagus
the
blanket
is
folded
up
and
we
see
spike's
head
poke
out
from
between
the
skeleton's
feet
he
sits
up
the
skeleton's
knees
draping
over
his
shoulders
and
sighs
in
relief
cut
to
the
dry
hills
on
the
outskirts
of
sunnydale
buffy
is
walking
down
a
dirt
road
behind
her
up
the
road
a
police
car
is
parked
below
and
ahead
of
her
she
sees
the
crime
scene
another
police
car
is
parked
and
a
detective
is
talking
with
a
uniformed
cop
as
two
coroner's
people
carry
a
gurney
with
a
small
zipped
bodybag
on
it
under
the
crime
scene
tape
buffy
she
turns
and
sees
riley
walking
down
the
road
towards
her
he's
in
full
commando
attire
he's
scratching
the
back
of
his
right
hand
again
hey
hey
look
i'm
sorry
about
earlier
i
know
everyone
came
on
pretty
strong
and
the
spike
thing
isn't
as
tweaked
as
it
looked
okay
maybe
it
is
but
there's
an
explanation
that
almost
makes
sense
buffy
sees
that
he's
looking
off
to
the
hills
hello
i'm
apologizing
here
and
i
think
that's
pretty
big
of
me
considering
i'm
the
one
who
was
almost
made
a
demon
sandwich
he
doesn't
say
anything
this
is
the
part
where
you
throw
me
a
bone
maggie's
dead
buffy
absorbs
this
news
but
before
she
can
say
anything
happy
now
buffy
eyes
narrowing
how
can
you
ask
me
that
of
course
i'm
not
happy
what
happened
riley
coldly
that's
classified
classifi
buffy
realizes
the
polgara
it
got
her
and
escaped
didn't
it
riley
just
nods
i'm
gonna
find
it
i'm
gonna
find
it
and
destroy
it
buffy
angry
and
then
you
can
stop
asking
me
how
happy
all
this
death
makes
me
she
steps
around
him
and
marches
quickly
back
up
the
road
riley
turns
as
if
to
say
something
but
doesn't
sighing
he
faces
the
crime
scene
again
cut
to
someone
knocking
on
a
door
tara
walks
up
and
opens
it
to
see
willow
in
the
hall
willow
smiling
howdy
tara
smiles
i
just
got
your
message
a
minute
ago
i
was
in
class
but
i
was
about

steps
back
to
let
willow
inside
i
had
so
much
fun
the
other
night

hope

you
don't
have
to
explain

been
um
thinking
about
that
last
spell
we
did
all
day
willow
excited
you
have
well
this
one
should
be
fun
too
we
conjure
the
goddess
thespia
to
help
us
locate
demonic
energy
in
the
area
it
shouldn't
be
too
tricky
the
goddess
thespia
are
you
sure
we're
ready
for
that
you
and
me
willow
gamely
this
is
beneath
us
tara
considers
okay

say
so
cut
to
willy's
bar
buffy
makes
her
entrance
by
pushing
aside
the
beaded
string
curtains
and
quickly
spots
willy
behind
the
bar
willy
sees
her
and
doesn't
bother
to
hide
a
god
must
hate
me
sigh
he
motions
her
to
the
other
end
of
the
bar

follows
and
leans
on
the
bar

killing
me

his
leave

beer

some
changes
with
my
life

filled
with
demons

he
approaches
buffy

sheen
of
sweat
on

he's
seeing
buffy
faces
him

thought

help
but
now
i
see
you're
not
hunting
demons

socializing
with
them

i
thought

were
supposed
to
be
killing
these
things
not
buying
them
drinks
by
this
point
he's
become
the
center
of
attention
buffy
sarcastic

undercover
moves

the
house

to
willy

love
to
classify
a
whatever
you
are

riley
he's
human
so
he's
human
she
looks
at
his
arms
you're
shaking
riley
looking
at
buffy
he
just
harbors
demons
which
makes
him
a
good
guy
like
you
riley
grabs
her
roughly
by
the
shoulders
the
truth
buffy
now
you
have
the
truth
you
are
just
too
screwed
up
because
of
what
happened
to
professor
walsh
to
see
it
buffy
raises
voice
now
let
go
of
me
buffy
knocks
his
hands
off
her
shoulders
a
middleage
looking
woman
gets
up
from
the
bar
and
walks
quickly
towards
the
door
riley
spots
her
over
his
shoulder
hold
it
you
she
stops
in
her
tracks
as
he
draws
his
barretta
and
aims
it
at
her
the
gun
is
trembling
in
his
hand
no
leaving
until
i
say
so
got
it
hey
we
got
new
rules
here
no
killing
riley
looking
over
his
shoulder
right
except
the
rules
don't
seem
to
apply
much
these
days
do
they
the
woman
is
now
facing
riley
and
looks
terrified
riley's
breathing
is
becoming
heavier
and
his
shaking
is
getting
worse
riley
to
the
woman
like
if
i
shot
you
right
now
i
don't
know
if
i'd
have
a
corpse
on
my
hands
or
one
pissed
off
vampire
riley
riley
to
buffy
i
mean
who
do
you
believe
first
it
sounds
like
lies
then
it
sounds
like
truth
looks
at
the
woman
she's
starting
to
whimper
riley

he
glances
at
buffy
and
seems
to
realize
what
he's
doing
he
suddenly
turns
to
the
bar
sweeping
his
gun
across
the
surface
smashing
several
glasses
the
woman
flees
buffy
slowly
approaches
him
concerned
he
has
his
hands
pressed
to
the
bar
as
he
leans
against
it
shaking
uncontrollably
what's
happening
to
me
part
three

fade
in
xander's
basement
it
seems
to
be
night
riley
is
sitting
on
the
bed
with
his
head
in
his
hands
he's
no
longer
wearing
his
commando
vest
gunbelt
nor
his
boots
buffy
brings
him
a
blanket
and
drapes
it
around
his
shoulders
as
she
sits
down
next
to
him
he
looks
up
and
pushes
the
blanket
off
he's
still
sweating
and
shaking
buffy
rubs
a
soothing
hand
on
his
back
buffy
soft
voice
riley
why
don't
you
lie
down
you'll
be
more
comfortable
she
sees
him
furiously
scratching
the
back
of
his
right
hand
he's
broken
the
surface
and
there's
a
patch
of
red
on
his
skin
she
grabs
his
hands
stop
it
riley
shaky
voice
i
can't
it's
like
something's
growing
inside
he
starts
scratching
and
she
takes
his
hand
again
no
you're
hurting
yourself
c'mere
buffy
reaches
up
and
pulls
off
the
red
scarf
she
had
wrapped
around
her
hair
okay
shh
buffy
gently
wraps
it
around
his
hand
i
thought
i
knew
but
i
don't
i
don't
know
anything
buffy
soothingly
shh
you're
sick
once
you
get
some
rest
no
buffy
i
don't
know
anything
i
don't
know
which
team
i'm
on
who
the
bad
guys
are
riley
looks
into
her
eyes
maybe
i'm
the
bad
guy
maybe
i'm
the
thing
you
should
kill
no
don't
you
even
think
that
buffy
puts
a
hand
on
his
cheek
okay

to
me
you're
sick
you
just
need
to
get
some
sleep
please
lie
down
for
me
come
on
he
pushes
himself
onto
the
bed
and
lays
his
head
on
the
pillow
he
curls
his
arms
and
legs
in
close
as
if
cold
and
continues
to
shiver
buffy
walks
around
to
the
side
and
leans
down
to
caress
his
cheek
buffy
quietly
you're
gonna
be
okay
his
eyes
are
closed
and
he
seems
to
calm
down
a
little
buffy
turns
and
steps
through
the
draped
blankets
to
the
other
side
of
the
basement
giles
xander
and
anya
are
there
researching
giles
is
bringing
a
box
of
old
books
they
haven't
looked
through
to
the
others
how
is
he
this
isn't
just
grief
making
him
act
this
way
something's
effecting
him
physically
and
it's
getting
worse
you
think
professor
walsh
did
something
to
him
i
don't
know
but
i'm
ready
to
find
out
that's
gonna
be
tough
what
with
maggie's
deadness
and
all
she
must
have
kept
records
somewhere
aabout
riley
about
314
about
all
of
it
and
i'm
sure
she
wasn't
the
only
person
that
knew
what
she
was
up
to
so
what's
the
plan
giles
anya
keep
researching
xander
you
and
i
are
going
undercover
hey
anya
steps
closer
to
xander
remember
before
no
xander
not
in
a
boyfriend
way
or
a
lead
him
to
a
certain
death
way
he's
the
only
one
with
military
experience
it's
not
like
he
was
in
the
'nam
he
was
gi
joe
for
one
night
it's
okay
anya
i've
backed
up
buffy
before
anya
concerned
can't
you
do
something
else
to
help
them
like
xerox
handouts
or
something
i'll
be
careful
xander
puts
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
promise
she
concedes
but
is
not
happy
about
it
and
xander
goes
to
get
ready
giles
stands
up
from
the
box
of
books
he
was
going
through
and
faces
buffy
it's
a
minor
point
but
how
do
you
plan
to
get
in
to
the
initiative
i'm
sure
their
security
system's
almost
impenetrable
i
have
my
clearance
i'm
hoping
she
didn't
have
time
to
revoke
it
okay
well
as
for
the
whereabouts
of
this
polgara
demon
i'm
afraid
we've
we've
not
turned
up
much
there've
been
no
reports
since
its
original
capture
then
we'll
just
have
to
keep
looking
cut
to
tara's
room
there
is
a
bundle
of
string
shaped
into
a
square
on
the
floor
with
four
different
color
crystals
weighing
down
each
corner
willow
and
tara
are
sitting
on
either
side
of
the
square
willow
is
grounding
something
in
a
small
bowl
so
the
square
is
sunnydale
right
it's
like
a
map
we
both
take
different
parts
of
the
potion
and
when
we
do
the
incantation
we
both
blow
it
onto
the
square
at
the
exact
same
time
but
how
does
it
work
well
that's
the
cool
part
when
the
potion
mixes
and
thespia's
called
it
creates
this
mist
over
the
parts
where
the
demons
are
iit
even
makes
different
colors
for
different
breeds
wow
you
ready
tara
nods
willow
pours
some
of
the
powdered
contents
of
the
bowl
into
tara's
palm
then
pours
some
into
her
own
hand
from
a
second
bowl
let's
do
it
she
closes
her
eyes
and
tara
does
the
same
thespia
we
walk
in
shadow
walk
in
blindness
you
are
the
protector
of
the
night
thespia
goddess
ruler
of
all
darkness
we
implore
you
open
a
window
to
the
world
of
the
underbeing
willow
blows
the
powder
out
of
her
hand
over
the
square
tara
blows
over
her
hand
not
disturbing
her
powder
and
leans
toward
her
bed
to
dump
the
potion
underneath
it
willow
still
has
her
eyes
closed
and
did
not
see
this
with
your
knowledge
may
we
go
in
safety
with
your
grace
may
we
speak
of
your
benevolence
willow
opens
her
eyes
and
looks
down
at
the
square
where
nothing
is
happening
she
frowns
or
not
she
looks
at
tara
tara
gives
her
a
disappointed
look
cut
to
lowell
house
buffy
and
xander
are
quietly
walking
through
the
deserted
lobby
xander
is
wearing
military
garb
similar
to
that
of
the
initiative
commandos
he
even
has
a
gun
belt
with
a
sidearm
in
the
holster
buffy
is
wearing
a
turtleneck
sweater
wirerimmed
glasses
and
has
her
hair
pulled
back
in
a
small
bun
she
is
carrying
a
white
lab
coat
wrapped
around
a
clipboard
seems
pretty
quite
it
usually
is
this
time
of
a
young
man
suddenly
brushes
past
her
but
doesn't
even
act
as
if
he
notices
them
and
continues
on
buffy
and
xander
continue
into
the
central
hallway
of
the
building
and
buffy
pushes
the
hidden
switch
in
the
wall
next
to
the
floor
to
ceiling
mirror
and
stands
in
front
of
it
xander
stepping
up
next
to
her
buff
maybe
you
should
check
the
look
later
shh
buffy
shoves
him
away
none
too
gently
oww
xander
surprised
and
a
little
hurt
what'd
you
do
that
for
sorry
i'm
the
only
one
that
can
pass
the
retinal
scan
the
re
eww
i
don't
wanna
see
that
buffy
glares
retinal
scan
xander
buffy
looks
into
the
mirror
again
well
we'll
know
in
a
few
seconds
if
my
clearance
is
still
good
a
horizontal
green
light
emits
from
the
mirror
and
slides
down
over
her
body
or
if
we're
about
to
die
at
the
hands
of
fifty
grieffilled
military
goons
retinal
scan
recorded
summers
buffy
the
mirror
slides
to
the
side
and
buffy
steps
into
the
very
white
elevator
xander
follows
her
why
am
i
not
entirely
comforted
by
the
arrival
of
the
mansized
microwave
cut
to
initiative
the
elevator
door
slides
open
and
buffy
is
now
wearing
the
lab
coat
and
she
and
xander
step
out
onto
the
catwalk
overlooking
the
huge
hangar
of
the
initiative
complex
his
eyes
widen
as
he
gapes
xander
awed
holy
moly
i
know
i
totally
get
it
now
can
i
have
sex
with
riley
too
buffy
glares
at
him
but
he's
still
staring
and
doesn't
see
it
she
takes
his
arm
and
leads
him
towards
the
stairs
when
they
descend
to
the
first
landing
they
see
a
couple
of
commandos
climbing
the
stairs
towards
them
xander
turns
to
buffy
and
pulls
her
close
to
him
xander
whispers
quick
pretend
to
make
out
with
me
buffy
whispers
what
what
are
you
talking
about
buffy
pushes
away
xander
whispers
well
i
uh
you
know
in
the
movies
the
guy
and
the
girl
have
to
hide
they
pretend
to
be
looking
at
her
clipboard
as
the
commandos
pass
them
and
continue
up
the
stairs
buffy
whispers
please
could
you
possibly
draw
more
attention
to
us
when
the
commandos
are
gone
they
continue
down
to
stairs
buffy
whispers
this
is
the
initiative
xander
military
guys
and
scientists
do
not
make
out
with
each
other
xander
whispers
well
maybe
that's
what's
wrong
with
the
world
ever
think
about
that
back
at
xander's
basement
riley
is
still
in
bed
and
is
sleeping
cut
to
the
other
side
of
the
basement
willow
is
pacing
anya
is
sitting
in
a
large
beanbag
looking
through
a
book
and
giles
is
fixing
tea
on
the
washing
machine
it
totally
failed
it
wasn't
even
like
the
spell
went
wrong
it
just
wouldn't
if
it's
any
consolation
we
haven't
fared
much
better
here
really
is
riley
okay
well
hhe's
asleep
finally
but
he
doesn't
look
good
giles
hands
anya
a
cup
and
the
uh
research
is
troubling
as
well
i
mean
thisthis
demon
we're
after
seems
highly
atypical
for
a
polgara
this
child
that
it
killed
was
mutilated
there's
no
recorded
cases
of
a
polgara
ever
having
done
such
a
thing
anya
fidgeting
with
the
string
of
her
tea
bag
also
the
polgara
have
to
eat
every
two
hours
factor
in
the
low
iq
and
you
have
a
demon
who's
not
exactly
low
profile
so
how
has
he
been
hiding
out
in
sunnydale
for
the
last
two
days
without
anyone
seeing
him
exactly
willow
pushes
aside
the
blanket
to
check
on
riley
she
finds
him
standing
just
a
foot
in
front
of
her
his
eyes
look
a
little
sunken
willow
surprised
riley
riley
agitated
where's
buffy
she
went
out
cancan
i
get
you
something
he
sits
on
the
bed
to
pull
on
his
boots
just
tell
me
where
she
is
you're
not
well
riley
yyou
need
to
rest
did
she
find
the
polgara
riley
stands
rubbing
his
arm
as
if
cold
huh
is
that
it
well
no
we're
still
looking
but
but
what
she
went
to
find
out
what's
making
you
sick
riley
sharply
i'm
not
sick
riley
more
agitated
you're
telling
me
she
went
to
the
initiative
riley
she's
just
trying
to
help
you
riley
crosses
the
basement
to
grab
his
gear
she
doesn't
belong
there
willow
hurries
to
stand
in
front
of
the
stairs
to
block
his
way
riley
listen
stand
away
from
the
stairs
no
you're
gonna
get
buffy
killed
he
shoves
her
hard
to
the
ground
hey
he
and
anya
rush
to
willow
as
riley
dashes
up
the
stairs
you
all
right
willow
is
shaken
but
doesn't
seemed
to
be
hurt
cut
to
initiative
buffy
and
xander
are
rounding
a
corner
when
they
hear
someone
coming
from
down
the
corridor
how
many
of
the
men
are
still
out
they
return
to
the
corner
and
try
to
look
inconspicuous
as
dr
angleman
enters
the
corridor
with
another
scientist
they
eavesdrop
the
longer
they
go
without
their
meds

everyone's
off
their
schedules
because
of
the
professor's
death
it's
dangerous
i
don't
want
to
think
about
the
damage
our
guys
could
do
under
the
stress
of
withdrawal
especially
since
they
won't
understand
what's
happening
to
them
these
guys
don't
know
they've
been
getting
meds
in
their
food
so
we
better
get
them
in
here
stat
we've
located
all
but
a
few
the
last
ones
were
in
pretty
bad
shape
but
we
stabilized
them
but
finn
wasn't
one
of
them
right
no
find
him
he's
the
one
i
care
about
he's
too
important
to
the
work
to
lose
now
indeed
cut
to
willy's
place
spike
walks
in
through
the
beaded
curtains
and
heads
to
the
bar
doubleshot
of
oneg
'keep
and
make
it

good
stuff

a
shot

and
a
bottle
of
thick
red
liquid
spike

is
being
poured

a
pisser
of
a
day
isn't
it
those
army
blokes
are
on
a
tear
they
ran
me
outta
my
place
and
all
over
town
willy
moves
on
and
before
spike
can
take
a
drink
a
large
demon
hand
falls
on
his
shoulder
yeah
what's
that
spike
turns
his
head
to
look
at
the
demon
spike's
pov
the
demon
raises
his
other
clawed
hand
in
a
closed
fist
and
punches
the
camera
out
fade
out
cut
to
the
initiative
buffy
and
xander
are
still
eavesdropping
on
angleman
keep
me
posted
i'll
be
in
records
he
walks
away
and
the
other
scientist
heads
in
the
other
direction
buffy
keeps
her
back
turned
as
angleman
passes
behind
her
to
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
he
slips
a
key
card
through
an
electronic
lock
and
steps
through
the
door
it's
swinging
close
behind
him
but
buffy
shoves
the
clipboard
inside
before
it
can
and
walks
in
she
hands
the
clipboard
to
xander
and
marches
up
behind
angleman
who
is
unaware
until
she
spins
him
around
to
face
her
and
shoves
him
against
a
counter
getting
a
fistful
of
his
shirt
buffy
pissed
now
i
don't
generally
like
to
kill
humans
but
i've
learned
that
it
pays
to
be
flexible
in
life
i
was
wondering
when
you'd
turn
up
buffy
mock
disappointment
oh
darn
buffy
takes
off
her
glasses
so
this
isn't
a
surprise
now
you
can
tell
me
what
you
did
to
riley
and
after
that
we
can
take
a
tour
of
room
314
somebody's
coming
you
know
i'm
sure
they've
already
seen
you
on
the
security
monitors
riley
stepping
from
around
a
the
corner
monitors
are
nonfunctional
at
this
time
sir
went
down
about
ten
minutes
ago
buffy
looks
to
xander
what
i
didn't
do
that
thank
god
for
small
favors
and
we'll
worry
about
details
later
huh
buff
finn
take
this
girl
to
the
stockade
immediately
riley
he
can
tell
us
what
we
need
to
know
buffy
to
angleman
maggie
wanted
me
dead
didn't
she
angleman
a
beat
she
did
angleman
to
riley
but
understand
the
initiative
has
no
interest
in
eliminating
the
slayer
it
was
her
own
vendetta
why
spell
it
out
for
me
i
feel
an
attack
of
dumb
blonde
coming
on
i
don't
know
buffy
jerks
him
closer
well
think
harder
it
was
the
project
project
314
it

glances
at
riley
who
is
paying
close
attention
angleman
to
buffy
it
escaped
riley
stepping
closer
that's
enough
you're
making
her
sound
like
some
psychopath
she
wasn't
like
that
she
was
a
brilliant
woman
she
was
iit's
not
riley
angleman
angry
all
she
was
doing
was
trying
to
help
people
and
this
is
the
way
you
want
them
to
remember
her
buffy
to
riley
angleman
said
walsh
was
feeding
you
drugs
you're
doing
this
to
me
aren't
you
he
advances
on
her
and
buffy
lets
go
of
angleman
to
face
him
angleman
starts
slinking
away
towards
a
nearby
door
riley
glaring
this
all
started
because
of
you
look
if
you
will
just
listen
to
me
okay
i
am
trying
to
help
you
get
to
the
truth
you
want
truth
then
tell
me

riley
grabs
her
arm
what
did
you
do
to
her
buffy
buffy
breaks
the
hold
stop
it
i
didn't
do
anything
riley
tries
to
grab
her
again
and
she
has
to
push
him
back
riley
stop
this
isn't
about
us
everything
that
we
need
to
know
is
here
we
just
need
to
find
out
what
was
in
314
a
commando's
body
suddenly
drops
to
the
floor
behind
them
they
all
turn
and
look
up
on
a
catwalk
adam
is
looking
down
at
them
me
part
four

fade
in
adam
starts
to
pace
across
the
catwalk
i've
been
thinking
about
the
world
i
wanted
to
see
it
learn
it
i
saw
the
inside
of
that
boy
and
it
was
beautiful
but
it
didn't
tell
me
about
the
world
it
just
made
me
feel
so
now
i
want
to
learn
about
me
why
i
feel
what
i
am
he
stops
pacing
and
turns
to
face
them
he
takes
a
step
forward
and
drops
to
the
floor
landing
on
his
feet
he's
looking
at
riley
so
i
came
home
he
pulls
out
a
computer
disk
from
the
cargo
pocket
of
his
camouflage
pants
its
labeled
adam
and
he
slides
it
into
the
drive
slot
of
the
metal
plate
on
his
chest
the
disk
loads
itself
with
a
soft
whirring
adam
pacing
again
i'm
a
kinematically
redundant
biomechanical
demonoid
designed
by
maggie
walsh
she
called
me
adam
and
i
called
her
mother
adam
maggie
would
want
you
to
stand
down
adam
looks
at
him
yes
but
i
seem
to
have
a
design
flaw
angleman
looks
as
if
he's
ready
to
bolt
buffy
has
a
oh
shit
look
on
her
face
adam
pacing
in
addition
to
organic
material
i'm
equipped
with
gp2d11
infrared
detectors
a
harmonic
decelerator
plus
dc
servo
she
pieced
you
together
from
parts
of
other
demons
adam
looks
down
at
his
green
polgara
arm
and
his
dark
tan
demon
right
arm
which
is
plated
with
metal
on
the
forearm
and
shoulder
and
man
and
machine
which
tells
me
what
i
am
but
not
who
i
am
mother
wrote
things
down
hard
data
but
also
her
feelings
that's
how
i
learned
that
i
have
a
job
here
and
that
she
loved
me
she
wasn't
your
mother
and
she
didn't
love
you
xander
not
taking
eyes
off
adam
is
that
really
the
issue
she
made
you
because
she
was
a
scientist
xander
warningly
rileeey
riley
finn
he
pulls
out
another
disk
this
one
labeled
finn
and
loads
it
into
his
chest
stop
those
files
oh
mother
created
you
too
maggie
is
not
my
mother
riley
to
buffy
i
have
a
mother
a
real
a
birth
mother
yes
but
after
you
met
maggie
she
was
the
one
who
shaped
your
basic
operating
system
she
taught
you
how
to
think
how
to
feel
she
fed
you
chemicals

his
holding

up

plan
she
had
for
us
what

quietly

do

want
to
hear
no
riley
draws
his
barretta
and
aims
it
at
adam
before
he
can
pull
the
trigger
adam
grabs
his
arm
and
forces
him
to
drop
it
buffy
rushes
forward
and
adam
backhands
her
in
the
face
sending
her
to
the
floor
riley
frees
himself
and
punches
adam
across
the
metal
side
of
his
face
adam
unfazed
hits
him
with
an
uppercut
that
sends
him
flying
high
across
the
room
over
a
middle
work
table
he
hits
the
floor
in
a
tumble
stunned
xander
rushes
forward
but
adam
just
shoves
him
back
against
the
wall
and
he
goes
down
buffy
is
on
her
feet
and
sends
a
powerful
roundkick
to
adam's
chest
adam
just
looks
at
her
and
smashes
a
fist
across
her
face
she
retaliates
with
a
punch
to
his
midsection
adam
responds
by
slamming
the
same
fist
down
on
her
shoulder
this
time
driving
her
to
the
floor
angleman
decides
it's
time
to
get
the
hell
out
of
there
and
runs
past
adam
heading
for
the
door
adam
sees
him
and
his
polgara
skewer
juts
out
of
his
arm
doctor
adam
steps
forward
and
plunges
the
skewer
into
angleman's
back
he
gasps
and
shudders
in
pain
for
a
few
seconds
then
falls
to
the
floor
sliding
off
the
spear
riley
runs
up
behind
adam
and
jumps
on
his
back
wrapping
an
arm
around
his
neck
adam
just
turns
on
him
and
stabs
him
in
the
left
side
of
his
abdomen
riley
falls
back
hitting
the
metal
railing
of
the
stairs
and
drops
to
the
floor
clutching
his
side
buffy
gets
to
her
feet
and
slams
a
side
kick
into
adam's
back
this
time
making
him
stumble
he
quickly
turns
and
she
ducks
a
slash
aimed
at
her
head
he
grabs
her
around
the
neck
with
his
other
hand
and
shoves
her
to
the
floor
cut
to
the
door
graham
and
forrest
can
be
seen
through
the
small
wiredglass
window
they
are
pounding
on
the
door
trying
to
get
in
adam
grabs
buffy
again
lifting
her
off
the
floor
and
throws
her
against
the
wall
she
hits
hard
and
falls
unmoving
adam
just
stands
and
looks
down
at
his
fallen
opponents
there
are
now
more
commandos
outside
the
door
trying
to
break
through
thank
you
this
has
been
very
interesting
he
walks
to
the
stairs
and
heads
back
up
to
the
catwalk
riley
is
lying
against
the
wall
in
pain
and
buffy
nearby
is
starting
to
move
again
commando
os
back
away
from
the
door
finally
one
of
the
commandos
sends
a
circle
of
shots
through
the
metal
door
around
the
handle
adam
walks
under
an
airvent
and
reaches
for
the
grated
cover
buffy
moves
to
riley's
side

around

two
of
the
commandos
standing
next
to
graham
aim
their
rifles
at
buffy
xander
not
liking
where
this
is
going
moves
closer
to
her
and
reaches
a
hand
down
to
her
xander
concerned
buffy
forrest
motions
graham
forward
and
buffy
has
to
move
as
he
and
forrest
lift
riley
to
his
feet
forrest
to
commandos
escort
them
out
riley
looks
back
at
buffy
riley
weakly
buffy
buffy
can
only
stand
and
watch
them
take
him
away
and
tears
start
to
fill
her
eyes
cut
to
the
door
of
willy's
place
swings
open
and
spike
is
ejected
tumbling
into
the
alley
in
a
broken
bloody
mess
as
he
lies
on
his
back
a
large
badass
demon
walks
out
and
stands
over
him
what
did
you
expect
spike
a
welcome
party
quick
shot
of
two
more
mean
looking
demons
standing
in
the
doorway
word's
out
you've
been
making
war
on
the
demon
world
spike
dazed
war
with
the
slayer
you
kill
other
demons
and
the
rest
of
us
don't
hold
with
that
the
other
two
demons
growling
duck
back
inside
where
the
jukebox
can
be
heard
playing
loudly
still
if
i
see
you
around
here
again
i'll
be
inclined
to
break
that
code
do
you
understand
spike
doesn't
or
can't
say
anything
and
the
demon
turns
and
walks
back
inside
leaving
spike
alone
cut
to
uc
sunnydale
next
day
willow
and
buffy
are
outside
walking
across
campus
no
word
from
riley
nothing
the
initiative
probably
has
him
locked
in
some
medical
ward
there's
no
way
i
can
get
near
him
until
i
come
up
with
a
better
plan
than
just
storming
in
and
getting
us
all
shot
yeah
you
might
want
to
work
the
kinks
out
of
that
one
what
am
i
going
to
do
he
needs
me
and
i
can't
get
near
him
you'll
find
a
way
it's
not
like
i
can
spend
all
of
my
energy
going
after
the
initiative
not
while
adam's
out
there
he's
really
that
big
of
a
threat
they
move
to
the
side
of
the
walkway
and
sit
down
on
a
wooden
bench
buffy
sighs
i
could
barely
fight
him
iit
was
like
maggie
designed
him
to
be
the
ultimate
warrior
he's
smart
and
fast
he
gave
the
commando
guys
the
slip
with
no
problem
there's
gotta
be
a
flaw
i
think
the
part
where
he's
pure
evil
and
kills
randomly
was
an
oversight
she
lets
herself
sit
back
as
her
thoughts
return
to
riley
i
never
should
have
let
them
take
riley
i
need
to
be
with
him
i'm
sure
he's
okay
there's
no
way
he
can
be
everything
he's
ever
believed
in
has
been
taken
away
or
he's
alone
he
has
nothing
to
hold
on
to
cut
to
the
corridors
of
the
initiative
commandos
and
scientists
are
going
about
business
as
usual
one
commando
is
standing
guard
at
a
closed
door
dissolve
to
interior
and
the
camera
pans
across
the
medical
room
where
we
see
riley
lying
on
a
bed
his
abdomen
is
wrapped
heavily
in
bandages
a
small
red
stain
over
his
wound
he's
still
sweating
a
little
but
no
longer
seems
agitated
he's
staring
at
the
wall
he
lifts
his
right
hand
and
looks
at
buffy's
scarf
still
wrapped
around
his
hand
end
