black
leather
skirt
over
her

looks
around
fearfully
panting
frowning
behind

jumps
to
her
feet
wrapping
the
skirt
around
her
body
she
stands
a
few
feet
away

have
bruises
and
hickeys
on

marks
on

goes
to
walk
past
spike

reaches
up
and
grabs
her
arm

gives
a
little
yelp
of
surprise
spike
pulls
her
down
onto
his
lap

her
so
that

hand
up
under
buffy's
skirt
she
makes
an
expression
of
pleasure

in

buffy
pushes
his
hand
away
struggles
against
him
stop
spike
grinning

for
about
another
half

on

he
moves
down
to
kiss
her
neck
buffy
moans
again
spike
lifts
himself
up
to
look
at
her
i
knew
i
knew
the
only
thing
better
than
killing
a
slayer
would
be
f
what
buffy
shoves
him
away
and
gets
up
angrily
moves
a
few
feet
away
spike
remains
sprawled
on
the
floor

that
what
this
is
about
doing
a
slayer
spike
smirking
well
i
wouldn't
throw
stones

to
be
quite
the
groupie

with
the
back
of
her

stares
at

angrily

into

down
on

fully
dressed
she
closes

with
lots
of
light
streaming
in
through
the
open
curtains
claudete
she

at
the
window
nothing

she
lifts
her
head
and
looks
at
the
window
willow
louder
claudete
willow
gestures
still
nothing
willow
frowns
gets
up
tiredly
walks
over
and
closes
the
curtains
with
her
hands
goes
back
to
the
bed
still
frowning
lies
down
and
closes
her
eyes
cut
to
the
magic
shop
anya
and
xander
sit
at
the
round
table
looking
at
books
all
these
demons
are
starting
to
look
alike
you
got
reptiles
reptiles
with
horns
reptiles
with
gills
shot
of
buffy
standing
by
the
counter
looking
at
books
glancing
over
at
xander
and
i'm
still
finding
nothing
of
the
'steal
a
diamond
freeze
a
guy'
variety
shot
of
anya
looking
very
interested
in
her
book
ahn
would
you
hand
me
that
one
next
to
you
anya
doesn't
respond
great
we're
not
even
married
yet
and
already
you've
stopped
listening
to
me
he
reaches
across
her
to
get
a
book
as
he
picks
it
up
something
falls
out
of
it
and
onto
the
table
close
shot
of
it
it's
a
magazine
called
bride
joy
xander
looks
at
it
puts
his
hand
on
the
book
anya's
reading
and
tips
it
down
reveal
that
she's
actually
reading
a
bridal
magazine
hidden
in
the
demon
book
anya
i'm
sorry
but
this
is
pointless
anya
buffy
coming
over
we've
been
researching
forever
and
we're
not
even
close
to
finding
out
who
robbed
that
museum
what's
up
anya
has
a
theory
she
thinks
that
martha
stewart
froze
that
guy
don't
be
ridiculous
martha
stewart
isn't
a
demon
anya
to
buffy
she's
a
witch
please
she
xander
pauses
really
of
course
nobody
could
do
that
much
decoupage
without
calling
on
the
powers
of
darkness
guys
while
this
is
fascinating
we
still
have
work
to
do
i
know
i
do
anya
looking
at
bridal
magazine
i
can't
decide
whether
to
put
my
bridesmaids
in
cocktail
dresses

anya
buffy
and
xander
rolling
their
eyes
or
the
traditional
burlap
with
blood
larva
the
traditional
what
well
i
was
a
demon
for
a
thousand
years
you
don't
expect
me
to
turn
my
back
on
all
the
ways
of
my
people
uh
can
i
weigh
in
on
this
whole
me
wearing
larva
no
buffy
sighs
in
irritation
sits
anya
to
xander
at
least
i'm
not
asking
you
to
perform
the
groom's
rite
of
selfflagellation
xander
is
about
to
reply
but
buffy
interrupts
uh
guys
there's
something
out
there
buffy
anya
and
xander
looking
embarrassed
there
is
and
as
much
as
i
hate
to
admit
that
my
bizarre
bridetobe
has
a
point
we're
gettin'
nowhere
here
buff
maybe
it's
time
to
try
something
new
you
know
hit
the
streets
get
spike
on
it
no
no
no
spike
and
no
hit
the
streets
we
we
we
stay
put
you
know
away
from
distractions
we'll
figure
this
out
what
about
willow
can't
she
do
something
maybe
but
she's
home
sleeping
sleeping
she
sick
no
she
was
out
late
with
amy
buffy
xander
looks
annoyed
and
i'm
bizarre
at
least
i
didn't
dump
you
to
hang
out
with
an
exrat
no
it's
not
like
that
you
know
she's
just
helping
amy
through
a
transition
and
making
herself
a
playmate
to
do
magic
with
someone
who
won't
monitor
her
like
tara
no
willow's
a
grownup
you
know
maybe
she
doesn't
need
to
be
monitored
xander
stares
at
her
you
know
she's
going
through
something
but
we're
not
her
i
mean
mmaybe
she
has
reasons
for
acting
this
way
buffy
anya
staring
at
her
and
so
what
if
she
crossed
a
line
you
know
we
all
do
stuff
stupid
stuff
but
then
we
learn
and
and
we
learn
and
and
we
don't
do
it
again
okay
so
you
know
who
are
we
to
get
all
judgey
not
judgey
buff
just
observey
yeah
all
we're
saying
is
she's
acting
different
you
know
she's
not
herself
anya
and
xander
return
to
looking
at
books
buffy
stares
at
them
looks
contemplative
cut
to
the
street
amy
and
willow
walk
along
past
the
coffee
shop
it's
night
various
people
walking
around
sitting
and
drinking
coffee
etc
so
what
do
you
wanna
do
it's
gonna
be
hard
to
top
last
night
yeah
i
don't
know
if
i
can
i
felt
awful
today
and
i
couldn't
do
magic
took
me
all
day
to
get
my
powers
back

think
we
should
just
take
it

i'm
just
gonna
take
a
little
tour
he
puts
his
hand
over
willow's
chest
not
actually
touching
her
suddenly
a
bolt
of
magic
goes
from
his
hand
into
her
body
willow
gasps
and
closes
her
eyes
rack
closes
his
eyes
too
magic
sparks
and
red
light
continue
swirling
around
his
hand
and
willow's
body
both
panting
amy
watches
intently
after
a
moment
the
magic
breaks
off
and
rack
takes
his
hand
back
opens
his
eyes
looks
at
willow
grins
a
little
he
leans
forward
puts
his
fingers
on
willow's
chin
and
puts
his
face
next
to
her
whispers
in
her
ear
you
taste
like
strawberries
he
pulls
back
willow
still
has
her
eyes
closed
with
an
expression
of
ecstasy
cut
to
later
amy
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
room
spinning
around
and
around
with
her
arms
held
out
at
her
sides
dreamy
music
shot
of
rack
reclining
on
a
sofa
nearby
holding
in
his
hands
what
looks
like
a
glass
ball
with
a
reflection
of
amy
spinning
around
inside
it
amy
continues
to
spin
faster
and
faster
until
she's
a
blur
rack
looks
upward
pan
slowly
up
to
reveal
willow
on
the
ceiling
she
lies
there
with
her
shirt
almost
completely
unbuttoned
her
hair
spread
out
across
the
ceiling
she
writhes
slowly
a
small
smile
on
her
face
willow
opens
her
eyes
looks
down
shot
of
the
room
from
her
perspective
with
sofas
around
the
perimeter
and
a
round
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
surrounded
by
cushions
bright
green
grass
begins
to
sprout
covering
the
entire
floor
and
all
the
furniture
willow
closes
her
eyes
again
rolls
over
onto
her
stomach
on
the
ceiling
blurry
motion
suggesting
the
passing
of
time
she
rolls
back
over
onto
her
back
the
grass
and
bright
green
trees
and
bushes
continue
to
grow
on
the
floor
willow
continues
to
writhe
in
ecstasy
on
the
ceiling
we
see
a
figure
of
a
person
moving
in
the
foliage
but
can't
make
it
out
willow
opens
her
eyes
and
looks
we
see
what
looks
like
the
bare
legs
of
a
person
being
dragged
under
a
bush
willow
frowns
a
little
then
a
redskinned
demon
comes
out
from
under
the
bush
and
snarls
up
at
willow
willow
gives
a
short
scream
and
falls
from
the
ceiling
she
lands
on
her
stomach
on
the
floor
all
the
grass
and
greenery
is
gone
it
was
a
hallucination
willow
just
lies
there
on
the
floor
zoom
in
on
her
face
her
eyes
are
closed
suddenly
she
blurs
into
motion
she's
standing
up
in
a
room
full
of
people
the
bronze
her
eyes
are
completely
black
another
blur
of
motion
and
suddenly
she's
standing
on
the
street
in
front
of
the
magic
box
the
store
all
lit
up
behind
her
zoom
in
on
willow

pants
and
looks
around

another
blur
and
she's
back
on
the
floor
she
slowly
opens
her
eyes
which
are
now
normal

frowns
gets
up
to
a
kneeling
position
we
see
that

in
her
bedroom

kneels
there
panting
and
looking
around
with
a
frown
cut
to
the
bathroom
the
shower
is
running
a
pair
of
hands
press
against
the
wall
underneath

face
under

walks
out

a
red
robe

walks
slowly
into

a
box
of
clothing
with
the
word

takes
a
sweater

dawn
stares
in
front
of
her
fidgeting
a
little
a
sleazylooking
guy
comes
and
sits
down
next
to
her
putting
his
pack
of

on

lit
cigarette
in

and
stands
there
hugging

nervously
cut
to

reclining
on
a
sofa
what

sparkles
on
his
hand

shoots
a
bolt
of
magic
upward
peppy
rock
music
begins
pan
along
the
stream
of
magic
light
to
reveal
willow
hovering
in
midair
surrounded
by
a
bubble
of
magic
the
stream
coming
from
rack's
hand
adds
to
the
bubble
close
shot
of
willow's
face
with
her
eyes
closed
cut
to
a
view
of
outer
space
blackness
and
stars
all
around
stars
moving
past
the
music
changes
to
something
dreamy
and
futuristic
willow's
erratic
breathing
is
very
loud
willow
floats
in
the
starscape
dreamily
she
reaches
out
her
hand
to
touch
some
of
the
stars
suddenly
a
bright
red
rift
appears
ahead
of
her
willow
frowns
her
eyes
still
closed
the
same
demon
from
her
other
hallucination
walks
through
the
rift
holding
a
woman
in
his
arms
the
woman
dangles
limply
as
if
dead
willow
screams
cut
back
to

there
watching
her

smiles
as

scream
continues
cut
to

crypt

whole
super
thing
will
there's
nothing
wrong
with
you
you
don't
need
magic
to
be
special
don't
i
i
mean
buffy
who
was
i
just
some
girl
tara
didn't
even
know
that
girl
you
are
more
than
some
girl
buffy
walks
into
the
room
and
tara
wants
you
to
stop
she
loves
you
we
don't
know
that
i
know
that
i
promise
you
i
just
it
took
me
away
from
myself
i
was
free
buffy
looks
down
pensive
i
get
that
more
than
you
buffy
breaks
off
but
it's
wrong
people
get
hurt
buffy
goes
to
sit
beside
willow
on
the
bed
if
something
had
happened
to
dawn
tonight
something
worse
i
know
no
i
don't
think
you
do
ii
i
was
out
of
my
mind
i
i
did
things
i
can't
even
buffy
continues
looking
pensive
it
won't
happen
again
i
promise
no
more
spells
i'm
finished
buffy
frowns
good
i
think
it's
right
to
give
it
up
buffy
pensive
no
matter
how
good
it
feels
it's
not
worth
it
not
if
it
messes
with
the
people
i
love
buffy
still
has
her
pensive
expression
not
exactly
thinking
about
willow's
issues
the
magic
wasn't
all
great
i
won't
miss
the
nosebleeds
and
the
headaches
and
stuff
there
you
go
or
keeping
stinky
yak
cheese
in
my
bra
willow
buffy
frowns
don't
ask
now
i
don't
have
to
'cause
it's
over
exactly
it's
over
they
both
nod
and
give
each
other
nervous
looks
tentative
smiles
then
both
look
away
and
stop
smiling
cut
to
later
willow
lies
in
bed
panting
and
sweaty
staring
at
the
ceiling
one
hand
clutching
her
stomach
the
other
clenched
into
a
fist
on
the
pillow
cut
to
buffy's
room
pan
across
the
windows
on
each
window
several
strings
of
garlic
cloves
are
hanging
pan
down
to
reveal
buffy
sitting
on
her
bed
knees
drawn
up
to
her
chest
twirling
a
cross
in
her
hands
there's
garlic
festooning
the
bedframe
as
well
buffy
hugs
her
knees
looks
around
nervously
blackout
in
loving
memory
of
jd
peralta
joss
whedon
and
marti
noxon
the
end
