the
chapters
on
information
grouping
and
binary
coding
giles
looks
into
the
classroom
from
the
hall
i
bet
you'll
think
coding

pretty
cool
i
mean
if
you
find
twodigit
multistacked
conversions
and
primary
number
clusters
a
big
hoot
everyone
in
the
class
laughs
the
bell
rings
and
the
students
begin
to
leave
willow
watches
them
go
and
notices
giles
waiting
just
inside
of
the
doorway
giles
willow
goes
to
him
i
made
them

have
things
quite
under
control
willow
puts
things
away
well
i
had
good
lesson
plans
ms
calendar

them
on
her
computer

was
very
um

a
bunch
of
files
and
internet
sites
on
paganism
and
magic
and
stuff
willow
smiles
oh
yes
it's
really
interesting
giles
looks
down
away
from
her
willow
reaches
for
something
on
the
desk
and
uh
i
found
this
in
her
drawer
willow
giles
looks
up
she
told
me
it
was
a
rose
quartz
willow
giles
looks
at
her
hands
and
it
has
healing
powers
she
holds
up
a
light
pink
quartz
stone
strung
on
a
thin
leather
thong
i
thought
she'd
want
you
to
have
it
he
gets
up
from
the
desk
and
slowly
takes
the
necklace
from
her
he
gently
turns
it
over
in
his
hand
oh
thank
you
willow
that's
um
that's
very
thoughtful
of
you
he
turns
and
leaves
the
classroom
willow
watches
him
go
with
a
small
smile
on
her
face
cut
to
history
class
buffy
has
her
chin
propped
up
in
her
hand
bored
with
the
lecture
and
trying
not
to
fall
asleep
to
the
drone
of
the
male
teacher's
voice
before
1935
the
new
deal
focused
on
revitalizing
stricken
business
and
agricultural
communities
and
the
new
deal
also
tried
to
regulate
the
nation's
financial
hierarchy
to
avoid
another
disaster
like
the
1929
stock
market
crash
buffy
can't
help
but
close
her
eyes
for
a
moment
the
next
thing
she
knows
she
hears
a
woman's
voice
and
she
shakes
herself
out
of
her
reverie
don't
forget
your
assignments
are
due
on
friday
class
the
students
begin
to
leave
buffy
looks
around
and
is
taken
aback
by
the
sudden
changed
appearance
of
the
classroom
and
the
different
dress
and
hairstyles
of
the
other
students
i
told
ms
hall
we'd
go
help
decorate
the
gym
who
are
you
taking
she
hands
a
flyer
for
the
sadie
hawkins
dance
to
another
girl
buffy
can
see
that
the
year
on
it
reads
1955
david
said
yes
oh
you're
kidding

so
dreamy
buffy
looks
all
around
confused
ms
newman
collecting
papers

up
to
the
desk
and
hands
in
his
paper
also
thank
you
james
how
are
you
enjoying
that
book
i
loaned
you
the
hemingway
buffy
observes
and
listens
to
the
conversation
i
like
it
very
much
it's
honest
he
slowly
reaches
for
ms
newman's
hand
and
gently
takes
it
ms
newman
exhales
yes
it's
um
it's
based
on
a
true
story
actually
he
fell
in
love
with
his
they
are
interrupted
by
the
door
opening
and
let
go
of
their
hands
suddenly
buffy
finds
herself
back
in
her
history
class
as
her
teacher
continues
his
lecture
while
writing
on
the
board
hours
child
labor
buffy
stares
in
surprise
at
what
the
teacher
is
writing
and
collective
bargaining
the
teacher
looks
back
at
the
class
the
students
all
start
laughing
he
looks
back
at
the
board
and
sees
that
he's
just
written
don't
walk
away
from
me
bitch
in
huge
letters
oh
my
god
he
quickly
grabs
an
eraser
and
frantically
wipes
it
away
boy
smiling
did
you
see
what
he
wrote
cut
to
the
halls
buffy
and
xander
walk
through
the
doors
from
the
lounge
and
head
down
the
hall
i'm
telling
you
something
weird
is
going
on
something
weird
is
going
on
isn't
that
our
school
motto
pretty
much
but
i
don't
know
this
time
it
bugs
me
they
reach
his
locker
and
he
starts
to
work
the
combination
i
don't
wanna
poopoo
your
wiggins
but
a
domestic
dispute
a
little
case
of
chalkboard
tourette's
all
sounds
like
hellmouth
lite
to
me
he
opens
his
locker
and
a
wirymuscled
green
arm
shoots
out
and
grabs
him
by
the
shirt
he
screams
and
it
pulls
at
him
and
slams
him
into
the
locker
buffy
grabs
him
by
the
shoulders
and
tries
to
pull
him
away
but
the
arm
is
extremely
strong
and
pulls
xander
away
from
her
and
against
the
locker
again
he
screams
out
in
pain
when
he
hits
it
buffy
grabs
him
again
and
pulls
harder
and
the
arm
lets
go
xander
falls
to
the
floor
as
buffy
slams
the
locker
shut
he
scrambles
back
to
his
feet
and
they
both
look
around
the
hall
and
see
the
other
students'
reactions
they
are
all
confused
but
stay
away
and
just
stare
buffy
gives
xander
an
intent
look
and
indicates
that
they
should
open
his
locker
again
and
take
a
look
inside
xander
rubs
his
chin
and
stands
ready
as
buffy
slowly
lifts
the
latch
she
slowly
opens
the
door
and
they
peek
in
nothing
they
open
it
all
the
way
and
it
appears
to
be
completely
normal
cut
to
the
library
willow
is
at
the
table
studying
she
looks
up
when
she
hears
the
doors
open
and
sees
xander's
torn
shirt
xander
what
happened
did
cordelia
win
another
round
in
the
broom
closet
you're
just
a
big
bucket
of
funny
will
buffy
sits
down
next
to
her
xander
walks
over
to
giles
who
is
kneeling
and
going
through
some
books
on
a
shelf
i'll
have
you
know
i
was
just
accosted
by
some
kind
of
um
locker
monster
giles
looks
up
loch
ness
monster
'locker'
monster
is
what
he
said
but
it
wasn't
really
a
monster
it
was
like
this
big
arm
that
came
out
of
the
locker
but
then
we
opened
it
again
it
was
gone
nothing
this
was
right
after
buffy's
history
teacher
starts
doing
some
freaky
channeling
thing
in
class
giles
stands
up
ooh
sounds
like
paranormal
phenomena
willow
smiles
a
ghost
cool
oh
no
no
no
no
cool
this
was
no
wimpy
chain
rattler
this
was
'i'm
dead
as
hell
and
i'm
not
gonna
take
it
anymore'
giles
well
despite
the
xanderspeak
that's
a
fairly
accurate
definition
of
a
poltergeist
i
defined
something
accurately
xander
closes
a
book
on
the
table
guess
i'm
done
with
the
book
learning
sits
so
we
have
some
bad
boo
on
our
hands
yes
well
why
is
it
here
does
it
just
wanna
scare
people
unfortunately
he
doesn't
know
exactly
what
he
wants
that's
that's
the
trouble
see
uh
many
times
the
spirit
is
plagued
by
all
manner
of
worldly
troubles
being
dead

arm
and

frank
sobbing

a
gun

the
library
the
camera
pans
through
the
main
room
over
to
a
window
looking
into
giles'
office
george
and
ms
frank
can
be
heard
faintly
as
they
continue
their
quarrel
i'm
not
afraid
to
use
it
i
swear
if
i
can't
be
with
you
oh
my
god
don't
walk
away
from
me
bitch
giles
notices
george's
loud
yelling
and
looks
up
from
his
desk
he
gets
up
takes
off
his
glasses
and
walks
out
of
his
office
to
the
area
behind
the
checkout
counter
there
he
hears
a
faint
female
voice
i
need
you
he
looks
around
for
a
moment
then
jumps
to
a
conclusion
jenny
cut
to
the
hall
he
arrives
at
the
hall
intersection
don't
giles
looks
in
the
direction
of
george's
voice
and
sees
him
out
on
the
balcony
holding
the
gun
up
to
ms
frank
don't
do
that
damn
it
don't
talk
to
me
like
i'm
some
dumb
the
gun
goes
off
giles
rushes
to
the
other
side
of
the
intersection
and
hides
behind
the
corner
watching
the
events
as
they
unfold
outside
ms
frank
goes
into
shock
from
the
bullet
wound
and
begins
to
fall
backward
she
tumbles
over
the
balcony
railing
down
to
the
base
of
the
stairs
below
there
george
sees
her
lying
dead
with
her
eyes
closed
he
panics
and
runs
into
the
hall
as
he
reaches
the
intersection
giles
rushes
out
grabs
him
and
tackles
him
to
the
floor
george
loses
his
grip
on
the
gun
and
it
slides
away
as
it
does
so
it
dissolves
and
disappears
in
a
whiff
of
black
vapor
george
raises
his
head
as
giles
gets
to
his
knees
behind
him
and
holds
him
down
what's
going
on
what's
going
on

by
the
realization
that

theythey
had
no
intimate
relationship
he
comes
out

gun
did
you
find

happening
here
he
goes
into
the
cage
with
the
books
and
puts
them
away
fill
me
in
then
'cause

the
ghost
well
don't
you
see
well
shesheshe

now
she's
trapped
but
what
about
the
gun
i
mean
angel
didn't
shoot
ms
calendar
the
gun
is
insignificant
it's
the
violence
of
the
thing
that
matters
giles
goes
back
into
his
office
i
don't
know
these
fights
these
couples
keep
having
it's
sort
of
specific
she's
right
it's
a
pattern
that
doesn't
fit
with
the
way
ms
calendar
died
giles
comes
out
of
his
office
yes
well
i
uh
i
appreciate
your
thoughts
on
the
matter
i
in
fact
i
well
i
encourage
you
to
to
always
uh
challenge
me
uh
when
you
feel
it's
appropriate
you
should
never
be
cowed
by
authority
giles
starts
back
in
but
comes
back
except
of
course
in
this
instance
when
i
am
clearly
right
and
you
are
clearly
wrong
giles
goes
back
in
cut
to
the
computer
science
classroom
willow
xander
and
buffy
come
in
this
is
freaky
i
don't
ever
remember
ever
seeing
giles
be
this
weird
she
sits
at
the
desk
and
types
at
her
laptop
xander
leans
on
a
table
behind
her
buffy
walks
to
the
other
side
of
the
desk
i
know
he's
usually
investigatethingsfromeveryboringangle
guy
now
he's
iclingontomyonelameidea
guy
what
gives
he
misses
her
he
can't
think
just
a
little
more
fallout
from
my
love
life
okay
but
this
ghost
stuff
is
something
else
let
me
do
a
crosscheck
on
other
shootings
at
the
school
yeah
we
need
some
alternate
ghost
theories
what
do
we
know
dog
spit
is
cleaner
than
human
besides
that
willow
finds
something
oh
boy
we
know
plenty
she
scrolls
through
a
newspaper
article
on
her
laptop
the
title
reads
sunnydale
high
jock
kills
lover
self
it
says
a
student
murdered
a
teacher
on
the
night
of
the
sadie
hawkins
dance
the
rumor
was
they
were
having
an
affair
and
she
tried
to
break
it
off
after
he
killed
her
he
went
into
the
music
room
and
shot
himself
ladies
and
gentlemen
we
have
a
ghost
it
is
one
of
those
two
right
it
all
fits
the
gun
the
sadie
hawkins
dance
which
is
tonight
how
come
we've
never
heard
about
this
murdersuicide
thing
before
when
did
it
happen
1955
willow
and
xander
both
look
up
at
her
surprised
how
did
you
know
cut
to
a
short
while
later
buffy
sets
the
1955
sunnydale
high
yearbook
on
the
desk
and
opens
it
to
a
picture
of
ms
newman
okay
here's
the
new
strangeness
i
dreamt
about
this
woman
buffy
points
grace
newman
the
other
day
buffy
turns
more
pages
her
and
this
guy
buffy
points
jim
stanley
he's
the
one
he
did
it
your
dreams
are
getting
wicked
accurate
buff
you
wouldn't
happen
to
see
me
coming
across
some
big
cash
or
possibly
knowing
the
love
of
a
woman
in
a
full
body
sense
buffy
ignores
him
he
couldn't
make
her
love
him
so
he
killed
her
buffy
turns
away
sicko
buffy
steps
away
he
looks
so
normal
on
this
picture
he
was
smart
too
he
made
the
honor
roll
buffy
looks
back
smart
he
killed
a
person
and
killed
himself
those
are
pretty
much
two
of
the
dumbest
things
you
could
do
i
know
but
well
don't
you
feel
kind
of
bad
for
them
sure
i
feel
lousy
for
her
he's
a
murderer
and
he
should
pay
for
it
with
his
life
no
he
should
be
doing
sixty
years
in
a
prison
breaking
rocks
and
making
special
friends
with
roscoe
the
weightlifter
yikes
the
quality
of
mercy
is
not
buffy
whose
ghost
do
you
think
we're
dealing
with
his
or
hers
well
considering
how
violent
it
is
i'm
gonna
say
his
that
tracks
willow
sits
well
i've
been
browsing
on
some
of
ms
calendar's
pagan
sites
maybe
i
can
find
a
way
to
communicate
with
them
and
we
can
find
out
what
he
wants
who
cares
what
he
wants
we
need
to
shut
him
down
before
some
other
innocent
guy
goes
and
kills
some
poor
nice
girl
and
then
blows
his
brains
out
all
over
the
music
room
wall
okay
xander
smiles
and
rubs
his
hands
who's
hungry
cut
to
the
cafeteria
kraut
dogs
and
spaghetti
are
on
the
menu
today
cordelia
has
opted
for
spaghetti
and
after
paying
comes
over
to
the
team's
table
with
her
tray
i
hope
you
guys
aren't
going
to
the
sadie
hawkins
dance
tonight
cordelia
sits
'cause
i'm
organizing
a
boycott
do
you
realize
that
the
girls
have
to
ask
the
guys
and
pay
and
everything
i
mean
whose
genius
idea
was
that
obviously
some
hairylegged
feminist
really
well
we
need
to
nip
this
thing
in
the
bud
i
mean
otherwise
things
are
going
to
get
really
scary
suddenly
they
hear
several
students
scream
the
hot
dogs
and
spaghetti
have
all
turned
into
snakes
a
boy
pulls
his
snakedog
away
from
his
mouth
he
has
a
snake
protruding
from
his
lips
he
drops
the
bun
spits
out
the
snake
and
quickly
gets
up
backing
away
from
his
table
xander
and
the
others
look
back
at
their
table
and
see
snakes
all
over
it
as
well
they
quickly
get
up
except
for
cordelia
who
is
too
busy
screaming
to
think
when
she
finally
looks
at
the
table
again
a
snake
lunges
at
her
and
bites
her
on
the
cheek
she
reacts
fast
throws
the
snake
off
of
her
and
runs
snyder
comes
through
the
door
and
sees
the
mayhem
he
steps
back
just
as
a
student
comes
running
by
and
falls
over
a
table
moments
later
the
cafeteria
is
deserted
cut
to
later
outside
the
police
are
there
a
team
of
pest
controllers
is
gathering
the
snakes
which
in
the
mean
time
have
managed
to
make
their
way
all
around
the
school
students
are
still
fleeing
the
building
and
running
around
cut
to
an
ambulance
cordelia
and
xander
sit
at
the
back
while
a
paramedic
dresses
cordelia's
snakebite
perfect
i'm
gonna
be
scarred
and
swollen
why
didn't
they
just
kill
me
cut
to
the
police
chief's
car
snyder
holds
the
door
open
as
the
chief
gets
out
schoolboy
pranks
never
sell
snyder
slams
the
door
and
they
walk
the
sewer
got
backed
up
better
i
can
probably
make
that
one
fly
but
this
is
getting
out
of
hand
people
will
talk
you'll
take
care
of
it
i'm
doing
everything
i
can
but
you
people
have
to
realize
two
men
arrive
snyder
what's
going
on
here
backed
up
sewer
line
same
thing
happened
in
san
diego
just
last
week
the
two
men
continue
into
the
building
snyder
to
the
chief
we're
on
a
hellmouth
sooner
or
later
people
are
gonna
figure
that
out
the
city
council
was
told
that
you
could
handle
this
job
if
you
feel
that
you
can't
perhaps
you'd
like
to
take
that
up
with
the
mayor
chief
leaves
i'll
handle
it
i
will
cut
to
buffy's
house
that
night
cut
inside
to
her
room
she's
on
her
bed
xander
is
in
her
wicker
chair
cordelia
is
kneeling
and
leaning
against
the
bed
and
willow
is
standing
remember
the
plan
to
contact
the
spirit
and
talk
to
it
scrap
that
plan
buffy
you
were
right
the
time
for
touchyfeely
communication
is
passed
i've
done
some
homework
and
found
the
only
solution
is
the
final
solution
nuke
the
school
xander
smiles
i
like
that
not
quite
exorcism
are
you
crazy
i
saw
that
movie
even
the
priest
died
what's
the
deal
willow
lays
down
a
map
of
the
school
building
and
they
all
lean
in
to
look
okay
see
here
the
balcony
that's
where
the
original
teacher
died
back
in
1955
and
that
teacher
last
night
that's
the
hot
spot
where
all
the
bad
mojo
is
coming
from
we
need
to
create
a
mangustripod
a
what
willow
points
one
person
chants
here
on
the
hot
spot
and
the
other
three
chant
in
other
places
around
the
school
forming
a
triangle
it's
supposed
to
bind
the
bad
spirit
and
keep
it
from
doing
any
more
harm
well
i'll
take
the
hot
spot
buffy
takes
the
map
if
there's
trouble
that's
where
it'll
be
willow
nods
this
ghost
this
james
guy
is
fixating
on
you
buffy
the
dreams
the
yearbook
you
sure
you
can
handle
it
well
i'm
hoping
he'll
show
i
truly
am
cut
to
the
school
that
night
they
all
come
into
the
hall
from
outside
okay
we
all
have
our
places
we
do
the
chant
and
light
the
candle
at
midnight
exactly
any
questions
yeah
what
if
this
mangled
triangle
thingy
doesn't
work
oh
i
almost
forgot
i
made
us
all
scapulas
willow
hands
them
out
okay
so
we
can
flip
the
ghost
over
when
it
turns
a
nice
golden
brown
scapula
not
spatula
um
you
wear
it
around
your
neck
for
protection
you
expect
me
to
wear
this
it
smells
like
grandpa
breath
sorry
i
didn't
have
a
lot
of
time
i
had
to
use
sulfur
stinky
but
effective
okay
let's
do
this
they
all
continue
into
the
student
lounge
no
problem
this
will
be
a
piece
of
cake
right
they
hear
a
creaking
and
then
a
crashing
noise
they
jump
and
look
in
that
direction
and
see
that
the
doors
at
the
end
of
the
hall
have
slammed
shut
on

giles
and
willow
come
down
the
stairs
and
look
down
the
hall
they
hear
a
faint
buzzing
it
steadily
gets
louder
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
they
see
a
dark
swarm
of
wasps
coming
toward
them
oh
my
god
they
both
break
into
a
dead
run
as
they
round
a
corner
buffy
and
cordelia
join
them
from
another
hall
you
all
right
xander
comes
running
out
of
the
cafeteria
and
keeps
pace
they
reach
the
far
end
of
the
hall
where
the
doors
are
jammed
shut
get
back
giles
backs
off
and
buffy
kicks
the
door
open
shattering
the
glass
they
all
immediately
run
out
the
wasps
are
right
behind
them
when
they
reach
the
street
xander
looks
back
and
stops
check
it
they
all
stop
and
turn
to
look
as
well
i'd
say
school's
out
for
good
they
all
stare
in
amazement
giles
takes
off
his
glasses
the
wasps
have
arranged
themselves
in
a
wall
around
the
school
so
that
nothing
can
get
in
or
out
cut
to
the
living
room
at
buffy's
house
she
leans
against
the
wall
giles
and
the
others
are
seated
around
the
coffee
table
he
pours
some
tea
for
himself
there
is
also
a
pot
of
coffee
for
the
others
the
good
news
is
none
of
you
girls
were
shot
well
we've
established
based
on
all
the
parallels
andandand
buffy's
visions
that
it's
james'
spirit
so
what
do
we
do
giles
about
james
well
he's
obviously
reliving
the
night
of
the
sadie
hawkins
dance
when
he
killed
ms
newman
itit'sit's
common
enough
for
a
spirit
to
do
this
to
recreate
a
a
tragedy
cordelia
munches
a
cracker
hey
if
sunnydale
high
school
shuts
down
forever
do
we
automatically
graduate
xander
ignores
her
but
why
what
does
he
want
xander
thinks
again
about
cordelia's
question
actually
that's
an
interesting
point
he's
he's
trying
to
resolve
whatever
issues
are
keeping
him
in
limbo
wwwhat
exactly
those
are
i'm
not
buffy
interrupts
he
wants
forgiveness
giles
leans
back
yes
giles
gets
up
i
imagine
he
does
giles
goes
to
her
but
when
james
possesses
people
they
act
out
exactly
what
happened
that
night
so
he's
experiencing
a
form
of
purgatory
instead
i
mean
he's
he's
doomed
to
to
kill
his
ms
newman
over
and
over
and
over
again
and
forgiveness
is
impossible
good
he
doesn't
deserve
it
to
forgive
is
an
act
of
compassion
buffy
it's
it's
not
done
because
people
deserve
it
it's
done
because
they
need
it
no
james
destroyed
the
one
person
he
loved
the
most
in
a
moment
of
blind
passion
and
that's
not
something
you
forgive
no
matter
why
he
did
what
he
did
and
no
matter
if
he
knows
now
that
it
was
wrong
and
selfish
and
stupid
it
is
just
something
he's
gonna
have
to
live
with
he
can't
live
with
it
buff
he's
dead
she
just
looks
back
at
them
all
for
a
moment
then
stalks
off
into
the
kitchen
okay
overidentify
much
cordelia
munches
her
cracker
cut
to
the
kitchen
buffy
comes
in
she
has
her
hands
in
her
pockets
and
finds
a
folded
sheet
of
paper
she
pulls
it
out
and
unfolds
it
it's
a
class
of
'55
sadie
hawkins
dance
flyer
she
puts
down
the
flyer
and
hears
a
faint
male
voice
i
need
you
she
goes
out
the
kitchen
door
cut
to
the
living
room
willow
gets
up
from
her
chair
so
what
do
we
do
next
do
we
go
in
again
well
not
now
no
the
uh
the
spirit
is
too
angry
too
too
powerful
no
we
have
to
work
out
exactly
how
and
and
if
this
thing
can
be
defeated
cut
to
the
school
it
is
still
surrounded
by
the
swarm
of
wasps
buffy
walks
up
to
it
anyway
the
swarm
parts
to
let
her
in
when
she
reaches
the
doors
they
open
for
her
and
the
swarm
closes
the
gap
behind
her
part
4

the
kitchen
at
buffy's
house
willow
comes
in
looking
for
her
hey
buffy
are
you
see
sees
the
flyer
lying
on
the
island
and
picks
it
up
oh
god
giles
willow
he
comes
in
she
went
back
cut
to
the
school
they
all
stand
in
front
of
it
looking
at
the
swarm
so
what
now
not
even
a
megavat
of
raid's
gonna
do
the
trick
here
i
don't
get
it
is
she
trying
to
be
a
big
loner
hero
or
something
no
i
believe
she's
under
the
spirit's
thrall
he's
he's
calling
her
but
why
james
needs
her
to
reenact
everything
that
happened
on
the
night
that
he
he
killed
ms
newman
he
wants
to
change
things
make
make
a
happy
ending
but
it
can't
ever
happen
it
always
ends
the
same
which
means
buffy
just
went
in
there
to
get
shot
giles
yes
but
the
school's
deserted
there's
no
way
for
james
to
to
play
his
part
there's
there's
no
man
inside
for
him
to
possess
so
buffy
should
be
safe
until
we
find
a
way
to
get
her
out
in
theory
yeah
cut
inside
the
school
buffy
