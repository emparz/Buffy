so
sad

a
lot
of
stuff
that
he
didn't

sort
of
drowned
a
couple
years
ago

i
came
back

i
don't
i
don't

everybody
says
they
get
it
'oh

for
today'
but
what
they
really
what
is
a
reason
to
goof
off

mad
willow
contorting

oz
and
willow
laugh
buffy
shakes
her
head
guy
dating
harmony
dead
must
be
like
the
most
tolerant
guy
in
the
world
cut
to
underground
crypt
as
harmony
descends
into
it
she
walks
over
to
a
man
wearing
all
black
and
protective
headgear
for
drilling
she
puts
her
hand
on
his
back
to
draw
his
attention
hi

level
back
underground
spike
and
another
vampire
are
discussing
papers
strewn
over
a
table

the
crypt
right
i'm
not
keen
on
tunneling
into
someone's
septic
tank
it's
the
crypt
the
radar
soundings
are
clear
the
walls
are
thinnest
here
at
the
bottom
we'll
have
to
tunnel
underneath
more
work
but
i'm
sure

spike
slams
his
head
into
the
table
then
looks
down
at
him
you'd
better
be
more
than
sure
cause
i'd
hate
to
have
to
hurt
you
i
swear
i
swear
harmony
walks
up
and
snuggles
against
spike
how's
my
little
blondie

good
time
are

i
want
you
to
say
'this
is
for
messing
with
my
sweet
girl'
and
then
you
know
harmony
mock
bites
into
his
shoulder
making
grossly
noises
he
throws
the
vampire
aside
then
takes
harmony
by
the
waist
nobody
knows
i'm
here
and
i'm
not
killing
the
slayer's
best
friend
because
that
would
tend
to
announce
my
presence
harmony
gives
him
an
annoyed
put
out
look
and
we're
too
bloody
close
but

and
slams
her
into
the
wall

coyly
at

her
to
the
left

about
most
days
spike
strides
up
to
her

grabs
her
and
takes
off

vampire
equivalent
of
the
holy

source
of
some
enormous
power
was
conveniently
vague

a
great
deal
of
vampiric
interest
in
locating
it
during
the
uh

vampires
combed
the
earth

with
both
parties
satisfied
and
able
to
move
on
with
their
separate
lives
and
interests
to
sum
up
i
think
it's
a
workable
plan
so
the
crux
of
this
plan
is

sexual
intercourse
i've
said
it
like
a
dozen
times
uh
huh
just
working
through
a
little
hysterical
deafness
here
i
think
it's
the
secret
to
getting
you
out
of
my
mind
putting
you
behind
me
behind
me
figuratively
i'm
thinking
face
to
face
for
the
actual
event
itself
ah
right
it's
just
we
hardly
know
each
other
i
mean
i
like
you
and
you
have
a
certain
directness
that
i
admire
but
sexual
interc
what
you're
talking
about
welland
i'm
actually
turning
into
a
woman
as
i
say
thisbut
it's
about
expressing
something
and
accepting
consequences
oh
i
have
condoms
some
are
black
that's
that's
very
considerate
i
like
you
you're
funny
and
you're
nicely
shaped
and
frankly
it's
ludicrous
to
have
these
interlocking
bodies
and
not
interlock
please
remove
your
clothing
now
and
the
amazing
thing
still
more
romantic
than
faith
anya
moves
towards
him
and
they
kiss
the
buzzer
for
the
dryer
goes

fabric
softener
cut
to
the
party
buffy
finds
parker
parker
i
was
afraid
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
find
you
i
was
getting
a
little
worried
i'm
so
sorry
it's
just
that
the
english
guy
is
an
old
friend
and
he's
not
supposed
to
drink
and
i
saw
him
here
in
the
land
of
the
beer

it's
okay
you
did
a
good
thing
for
your
friend
did
uh
you
and
he
used
to
go
out
short
burst
of
hysterical
laughter
from
buffy
she
stops
abruptly
um
no
no
we
really
really
didn't
good
now
we
have
time
to
make
up
for
think
i
could
get
a
dance
with
the
prettiest
girl
at
the
party
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
stand
over
here
and
watch
they
dance
in
a
rather
close
intense
way
lucky
ones

bif
naked
plays
in
the
background
on
the
btvs
soundtrack
well
i
declared
premed
but
i
hated
it
so
i
switched
to
history
history
fascinating
dates
and
compelling
faces
but
there
something
amazing
about
these
huge
events
that
when
you
dig
down
into
them
they're
just
about
regular
people
trying
to
make
choices
when
you
look
back
at
it
seems
like
people
were
swept
up
in
events
they
couldn't
control
but
i
don't
believe
that
i
believe
you
have
a
choice
in
everything
you
do
they
kiss
is
this
okay
because
i
can
stop
if
you
wanna
it's
your
choice
parker
pulls
his
close
and
strokes
his
face

are
you
doing
making
a
choice

the
gem
of

may
know
what
it's
about
the
gem
may
exist
after
all
in
sunnydale
in
a
sealed
underground
crypt

looking
upset
lets
herself
fall
on
her
bed
to
the
side
cut
to
spike
climbing
into
the
crypt
with
a
lantern
he
looks
around
and
sees
a
large
green
gem
in
an
ornate
necklace
around
the
neck
of
a
skeleton
it's
real
ooh
pretty
can
i
take
stuff
harmony
has
followed
spike
into
the
crypt
and
is
also
holding
a
lantern
take
whatever
you
want
i
don't
care
she
walks
over
and
kisses
him
he
strokes
the
gem
and
yanks
it
off
the
skeleton
harmony
is
trying
on
a
tiara
eww
like
you're
too
good
to
work
a
clasp
he
puts
on
the
necklace
and
does
things
with
his
hands
feeling
all
powerful
so
is
it
doing
it
do
you
feel
it
i
mean
you
don't
look
different
if
you
were
wondering
i
thought
maybe
you'd
look
taller
or
glow
or
something
hmm
she
goes
back
to
playing
with
the
jewels
he
strides
over
and
grabs
a
cross
burning
his
hand
crying
out
in
pain
you
should
put
some
butter
on
that
but
hey
maybe
it's
worth
money
anyway
that
would
be
something
harmony
spike
strides
away
breaking
off
a
piece
of
wood
then
we
could
go
to
france
i
always
wanted
to
go
to
france
and
stay
in
a
chateau
and
you
could
take
me
shopping

she
cuts
off
as
he
stabs
her
with
the
improvisational
stake
to
their
surprise
she
doesn't
dust
but
the
wound
heals
immediately
i
can't
believe
you
just
did
that
she
starts
pummeling
him
with
girlie
punches
to
his
cheats
he
grabs
her
hand
and
notices
a
ring
she's
put
on
hold
on
he
grabs
a
cross
and
pushes
it
against
her
shielding
has
hand
with
a
cloth
noting
that
she
isn't
burnt
what
are
you
doing
you
big
freak
that's
my
gem
he
grabs
her
and
starts
to
yank
it
off
fine
if
that's
all
that
matters
to
you
harmony
rips
the
gem
off
her
hand
and
throws
it
at
him
and
he
catches
then
take
it
take
it
take
it
and
get
out
spike
puts
it
on
and
strides
off
that's
a
good
idea

spike
strolls
after
her
getting
tired
slayer
buffy
gets
up
only
to
be
hit
with
a
series
of
punches
and
floored
again
in
the
background
see
xander
running
up
xander
get
out
of
here
spike
grabs
him
knees
him
in
the
face
and
sends
him
flying
into
the
pole
from
hell
so
you
let
parker
take
a
poke
eh
didn't
seem
like
you
know
each
other
that
well
what
did
it
take
to
pry
apart
the
slayer's
dimpled
knees
you're
a
pig
spike
he
jumps
from
the
few
stairs
he
was
above
her
then
kicks
her
full
on
did
he
play
the
sensitive
lad
and
get
you
to
seduce
him
that's
a
good
trick
if
the
girls
thick
enough
to
buy
it
buffy
flies
up
and
delivers
a
roundhouse
however
spike
follows
it
with
an
equally
vicious
hit
that
sends
her
flying
forward
i
wonder
what
went
wrong
were
you
too
strong
did
you
bruise
the
boy
come
to
think
of
it
seems
like
someone
told
me
that
who
was
it
oh
yeah
angel
he
smiles
cruelly
and
buffy
is
up
in
an
instant
she
throws
a
round
house
then
a
punch
then
another
and
another
she
redirects
him
over
the
edge
of
a
planter
jumps
on
it
and
while
coming
down
kicks
him
sending
him
flying
into
another
planter
knocking
over
a
earthenware
pot
she
grabs
him
punching
him
twice
in
the
face
then
grabs
the
arm
with
the
ring
on
it
take
it
off
me
this
way
we
both
burn
really
let's
see
she
jerks
the
ring
off
his
finger
and
his
face
instantly
contorts
into
a
visage
of
pain
he
starts
to
smoke
then
runs
off
crying
out
in
agony
buffy
exhausted
sits
down
inspecting
the
ring
cut
to
a
close
up
of
the
ring
on
a
wooden
table
i
like
it
it's
small
really
worth
getting
my
ribs
bashed
in
the
scooby
gang
is
collected
at
giles
apartment
gathered
round
the
ring
which
is
set
in
the
middle
of
his
coffee
table
it's
also
very
dangerous
and
we're
destroying
it
we
don't
destroy
it
well
buffy
any
vampire
that
gets
his
hand
on
this
is
going
to
be
essentially
unlikable
giles
looks
at
buffy
for
a
moment
oh
i
have
that
gig
in
la
i
could
swing
by
thanks
oz
what's
going
on
what's
in
la
she's
giving
the
ring
to
angel
don't
make
a
fuss
buffy
are
you
sure
he
should
have
it
cut
to
buffy
and
willow
walking
through
the
campus
late
at
night
so
what
i'm
wondering
is
does
this
always
happen
sleep
with
a
guy
and
he
goes
all
evil
god
i'm
such
a
fool
well
maybe
you
made
a
mistake
but
that's
okay
next
time
what
parker
said
it's
okay
to
make
mistakes
it
was
sweet
no
it
wasn't
he
was
saying
that
so
you
would
take
a
chance
and
sleep
with
him
he's
a
poop
head
you're
right
he's
manipulative
and
shallow
and
why
doesn't
he
want
me
am
i
repulsive
if
there
was
something
repulsive
about
me
you
would
tell
me
right
i'm
your
friend
i
would
call
you
repulsive
in
a
second
maybe
parker
and
i
could
still
work
it
out
do
you
think
we
could
still
work
it
out
i
think
you're
missing
something
about
this
whole
poop
head
principal
i
think
i'm
gonna
take
a
walk
you
go
on
ahead
you
sure
yeah
she
heads
off
leaving
willow
behind
she
walks
along
alone
then
see
both
anya
and
harmony
all
looking
downtrodden
walking
along
black
out
