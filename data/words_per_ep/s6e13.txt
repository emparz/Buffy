out
virtue
fluttering

the
plan

buffy
embarrassed
soon
as
my
legs
start
working
spike
grins
leans
his
forehead
against
buffy's
arm

nods
relieved
xander
and

the
next
soul
train
out

buffy
holding
up
her
empty
plastic
cup

all
the
way
empty
more
nectar
required
cool
well
shimmy
on
out
when
you're
done
lubricating
buffy
smiles
widely
and
watches
the
others
go
out
onto
the
dance
floor
they
begin
to
dance
having
lots
of
fun
buffy's
smile
slowly
fades
and
she
looks
pensive
cut
to
buffy
walking
over
to
the
bar
she
puts
her
empty
cup
on
the
bar
and
waits
for
the
bartender
a
moment
then
changes
her
mind
turns
and
walks
away
leaving
the
cup
behind
by
the
way
she
is
wearing
a
white
sleeveless
blouse
and
a
short
lacy
black
skirt
buffy
goes
to
the
stairs
and
begins
climbing
toward
the
balcony
the
swing
music
fades
away
to
a
slower
sad
piece
the
balcony
is
basically
deserted
buffy
leans
on
the
railing
and
looks
down
shot
of
the
dance
floor
full
of
happy
dancing
people
including
the
scoobies
buffy
watches
them
with
a
sad
smile
spike
os
you
see
you
try
to
be
with
them
spike
walks
up
behind
buffy
but
you
always
end
up
in
the
dark

spike
whispering
in
her
ear
with
me
he
moves
up
right
behind
buffy
looks
where
she's
looking
shot
of
the
scoobies
from
buffy's
pov
what
would
they
think
of
you
if
they
found
out
all
the
things
you've
done
he
puts
his
hand
on
her
bare
shoulder
and
strokes
slowly
down
her
arm
if
they
knew
who
you
really
were
his
hand
moves
down
to
her
elbow
and
then
farther
down
out
of
shot
close
on
buffy's
face
buffy
whispers
don't
stop
me
close
on
spike's
hand
as
it
travels
down
buffy's
thigh
close
on
buffy's
face
as
she
closes
her
eyes
close
on
spike's
hand
pulling
her
skirt
up
close
on
buffy's
face
as
she
breathes
heavily
in
pleasure
close
on
spike's
face
making
a
similar
expression
of
pleasure
and
looking
at
buffy's
face
close
on
buffy's
face
still
with
her
eyes
closed
wider
shot
of
the
two
of
them
from
the
waist
up
spike
gives
a
strong
thrust
and
they
both
gasp
slightly
buffy
still
has
her
eyes
closed
spike
leans
in
to
look
at
her
face
no
don't
close
your
eyes
she
opens
her
eyes
look
at
them
shot
of
the
scoobies
dancing
on
oblivious
that's
not
your
world
you
belong
in
the
shadows
with
me
close
shot
on
spike's
face
as
he
continues
moving
slowly
and
talking
into
buffy's
ear
look
at
your
friends
and
tell
me
you
don't
love
getting
away
with
this
spike
buffy
still
watching
her
friends
right
under
their
noses
close
on
buffy's
face
as
she
looks
down
at
her
friends
cut

stands
there
looking
sad
cue
slow
sad
music
out
of
this
world
by
bush
cut
to
graveyard
night
buffy
walks
along
holding
a
stake
she
wears
a
brown
turtleneck
sweater
a
black
jacket
and
black
leather
gloves
when
we
die
we
go
into
the
arms
of
those
that
remember
us
cut
to
spike's
crypt
spike
stands
with
his
shirt
unbuttoned
smoking
a
cigarette
and
pouring
a
glass
of
blood
he
takes
a
pinch
of
some
herb
from
a
jar
and
sprinkles
it
in
the
blood
picks
up
the
glass
we
are
home
now
spike
pauses
as
if
hearing
or
sensing
something
he
looks
toward
the
door
smiles
out
of
our
heads
cut
to
exterior
shot
of
the
crypt
buffy
walks
up
out
of
our
minds
out
of
this
world
cut
to
inside
spike
walks
over
to
the
door
puts
his
hands
on
it
and
presses
his
body
against
it
out
of
our
time
cut
to
outside

by
the
speed
of
the
choices
that
we
make
no
sign
of
buffy
spike
frowns
looks
around
pan
across
the
assortment
of

sighs
that's
so
retrograde
cut
to
another
part
of
the
graveyard

walks
along
under
trees
the
music
fades
out
buffy
to
herself
don't

evil
bloodsucking
fiend

she
continues
hitting
him
throughout
this
now
spike
goes
back
to
human
face
he's
looking
very
bruised
and
bloody
but
he
doesn't
fight
back
just
takes
it
buffy
hits
him
again
and
again
looking
angry
and
desperate
finally
she
stops
and
looks
at
him
in
horror
spike
slurred
you
always
hurt
the
one
you
love
pet
buffy
gets
up
stares
at
him
looking
dismayed
buffy
she
looks
around
then
her
expression
turns
to
determination
she
starts
to
walk
toward
the
mouth
of
the
alley
close
on
spike
lying
on
the
ground
as
buffy's
legs
move
past
him
he
tries
to
reach
for
her
but
can't
buffy
cut
to
interior
police
station
buffy
walks
in
looks
around
various
officers
and
other
people
walking
around
sitting
etc
buffy
pauses
sees
the
front
desk

toward
it
we
see
the
desk
sergeant
talking
on
the
phone
desk

a
button
for

phone
line
desk

into
phone
sunnydale
pd
yeah
the
phone's
ringing
off
the
hook
here
buffy
turns
away
uncertain
she
takes
a
few
steps
away
as
we
can
still
see
the
desk
sergeant
in
the
background
listen
you
got
an
id
on
that
body
yet
desk
sergeant
buffy
closes
her
eyes
in
pain
yeah
okay
shoot
close
on
the
cop
as
he
grabs
a
pen
and
writes
katrina
silber
silber
back
to
buffy
whose
expression
changes
to
a
frown
as
the
name
triggers
recognition
warren
just
tell
her
to
go
away
i
can't
flashback
to
i
was
made
to
love
you
katrina
and
warren
stand
in
the
doorway
of
the
apartment
while
buffy
stands
on
the
front
step
you're
keeping
secrets
from
me
other
girls
and
who
knows
what
else
trina
shut
up
flash
to
present
buffy
to
herself
warren
close
on
the
desk
sergeant
desk
sergeant
into
phone
thanks
desk
sergeant
hangs
up
now
what's
the
problem
miss
he
trails
off
in
confusion
long
shot
of
buffy's
back
as
she
disappears
through
the
door
the
cop
shrugs
cut
to
magic
shop
day
close
on
an
open
book
showing
a
drawing
of
one
of
the
demons
from
the
forest
anya
os
is
this
what
you
saw
we
see
buffy
sitting
at
the
table
in
background
we
see
dawn
sitting
on
the
stairs
that
lead
to
the
loft
yeah
that's
it
we
see
xander
and
willow
sitting
at
the
table
as
well
and
anya
standing
beside
it
mm
the
rwasundi
very
rare
um
its
presence
in
our
dimension
causes
a
sort
of
localized
temporal
disturbance
so
that's
why
time
went
all
david
lynch
right
uh
human
perception
is
based
on
a
linear
chronology
being
exposed
to
the
rwasundi
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
can
cause
uh
vivid
hallucinations
and
a
slight
tingly
scalp
anya
sits
so
that's
it
these
things
just
made
you
think
you
killed
her
she
was
probably
dead
long
before
you
stumbled
across
her
it
wasn't
the
demons
it
was
warren
he
knew
katrina
he
had
something
to
do
with
it
i
know
it
how
can
you
be
sure
you
always
hurt
the
one
you
love
buffy
pauses
contemplating
this
dawn
sullen
not
looking
at
buffy
does
this
mean
you're
not
going
away
buffy
gets
up
and
walks
toward
dawn
yeah
i'm
not
going
anywhere
dawn
quickly
gets
to
her
feet
and
exits
before
buffy
can
reach
her
buffy
looks
upset
she
turns
back
to
the
scoobies
as
the
door
to
the
back
room
closes
behind
dawn
we
need
to
find
warren
and
the
others
whatever
they've
done
they're
not
gonna
get
away
with
it
cut
to
the
geeks'
new
lair
they
are
gathered
around
a
computer
with
warren
in
the
middle
working
the
keyboard
we're
gonna
get
away
with
it
warren
pointing
at
screen

consistent
with
a
fall

to
have
been
caused
by
an
accidental
drowning
or
suicide
cut
back
to
shot
of
the
three
geeks
looking
at
the
screen
the
coroner's
ruling
it
a
suicide
what
about
buffy
well
it
wasn't
that
hard
messing
her
game
up
if
she
figures
it
out
we'll
take
care
of
her
we
really
got
away
with
murder
warren
looks
at
andrew
smirking
we
see
that
the
scratches
on
warren's
face
are
healing
that's
kinda
cool
andrew
grins
a
little
jonathan
looks
at
the
other
two
looks
uncomfortable
warren
turns
his
smirk
to
jonathan
jonathan
weakly
yeah

you
sure
cut
to
buffy's
house
living
room
buffy
sits
on
the
coffeetable
facing
tara
who
sits
on
the
sofa
ii've
double
checked
everything
tara
smiling
there's
nothing
wrong
with
you
then
why
can
spike
hurt
me
well
i
said
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
you
but
you
are
different
shifting
you
out
of
fffrom
where
you
were
funneling
your
essence
back
into
your
body
iit
it
altered
you
on
a
basic
molecular
level
probably
just
enough
to
confuse
the
sensors
or
whatever
in
spike's
chip
but
it's
all
just
surfacey
physical
stuff
it
wouldn't
have
any
more
effect
than
a
bad
sunburn
buffy
looks
close
to
tears
as
she
contemplates
this
i
didn't
come
back
wrong
no
you're
the
same
buffy
tara
lightly
with
a
deep
tropical
cellular
tan
you
must
have
missed
something

you
check
again
tara
concerned
buffy
ii
promise
there's
nothing
wrong
with
you

buffy
meets
tara's
eyes
but
only
for
a
moment
then
looks
away
tara
frowns
as
she
begins
to
get
it
oh
longer
shot
of
the
two
of

tara
rubs
her
knees
nervously
oh
