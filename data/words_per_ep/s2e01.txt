your
nose
looks
so
tasty
he
reaches
up
with
his
napkin
and
gently
wipes
off
her
nose
he
takes
much
longer
than
he
needs
to
and
looks
into
her
eyes
he
brushes
his
hand
against
her
cheek
after
another
moment
he
starts
to
move
in
for
a
kiss
she
responds
in
kind
and
tilts
her
head
they
stop
just
short
of
making
contact
and
linger
there
a
moment
xander
finally
begins
to
pull
back
and
when
he
does
he
sees
a
vampire
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
willow
notices
his
glance
and
looks
too
she
screams
and
jumps
off
of
the
wall
as
xander
pulls
her
away
from
the
vampire
willow
go
he
puts
himself
between
her
and
the
vampire
she
doesn't
go
but
watches
as
he
punches
the
vampire
in
the
face
the
vampire
isn't
fazed
he
grabs
xander
and
tries
to
bite
xander
struggles
with
him
to
keep
from
being
bitten
after
a
few
moments
of
wrestling
a
hand
grabs
the
vampire
by
the
shoulder
and
pulls
him
off
of
xander
it's
a
girl
and
she
punches
the
vampire
in
the
face
knees
him
in
the
crotch
and
flips
him
over
onto
his
back
she
turns
to
willow
and
xander
hi
guys
the
vampire
gets
up
buffy
turns
her
attention
back
to
him
and
kicks
him
in
the
chest
sending
him
flying
into
a
tree
where
he
gets
impaled
on
a
dead
branch
and
bursts
into
ashes
she
turns
back
to
willow
and
xander
miss
me
opening

buffy's
theme
plays

on

sidewalk
buffy
hey
xander

her
hey

buffy
hugs
her
xander
hugs
buffy
again
man
your
timing
really
doesn't
suck
xander
laughs
when'd
you
get
back
uh
just
now
dad
drove
me
down
and
i
figured
you
two
losers
would
be
getting
into
some
kind
of
trouble
i
think
we
had
the
upper
hand
iin
a
subtle
way
does
either
of
you
even
have
a
cross
very
sloppy
well
it's
been
a
slow
summer
i
mean
that's
the
first
vampire
we've
seen
since
you
killed
the
master
it's
like
they
knew
i
was
coming
back
they
start
to
walk
so
what
about
you
how
was
your
summer
did
you
slay
anything
no
uh
just
hung
out
partied
some
shopping
was
also
a
major
theme
well
you
haven't
lost
your
touch
that
vampire
i
did
kinda
whale
on
him
didn't
i
xander
notices
i
like
your
hair
buffy
giggles
so
how
did
you
guys
fare
did
you
have
any
fun
without
me
no
yes
uh
our
summer
was
kinda
yawnworthy
our
biggest
excitement
was
burying
the
master
they
stop
walking
that's
right
you
missed
it
willow
points
right
out
by
that
tree
willow
buffy
looks
giles
buried
the
bones
and
we
poured
holy
water
and
we
got
to
wear
robes
very
intense
you
shoulda
been
have
you
seen
giles
why
would
i
do
that
i'll
see
him
at
school
man
i'm
really
glad
you're
back
buffy
looks
at
the
tree
again
me
too
cut
to
buffy's
room
her
dad
is
helping
her
mom
unpack
her
things
joyce
opens
a
suitcase
and
looks
through
it
okay
then
this
is
the
last
of
it
hank
puts
another
suitcase
on
the
bed
more
clothes
oh
do
shoes
count
as
clothes
how
much
shopping
did
you
let
her
do
oh
i
just
thought
i
was
saving
you
from
the
big
backtoschool
clothing
nightmare
hank
unzips
the
suitcase
my
nightmares
of
buffy
in
school
have
nothing
to
do
with
clothes
did
she
manage
to
stay
out
of
trouble
in
la
she
did
yeah
she
was
um
you
know
great
but
she
was
just
i
don't
know
um
distant
not
brooding
or
sulking
just
there
was
no
connection
the
more
time
we
spent
together
the
more
i
felt
like
she
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
hence
the
shoes
hank
hands
her
the
shoes
i
may
have
overcompensated
a
little
bit
hmm
it's
so
strange
you
know
at
least
when
she
was
burning
stuff
down
i
knew
what
to
say
well
welcome
to
my
world
i
haven't
been
able
to
get
through
to
her
for
so
long
i'll
just
be
happy
if
she
makes
it
through
the
school
year
cut
to
sunnydale
high
it
was
a
nightmare
a
total
nightmare
cut
to
her
and
two
friends
coming
down
some
stairs
and
walking
across
the
quad
i
mean
they
promised
me
they'd
take
me
to
st
croix
and
then
they
just
decide
to
go
to
tuscany
cordelia
exhales
art
and
buildings
i
was
totally
beachless
for
a
month
and
a
half
no
one
has
suffered
like
i
have
of
course
i
think
that
that
kind
of
adversity
builds
character
well
then
i
thought
i
already
have
a
lot
of
character
is
it
possible
to
have
too
much
character
the
first
day
back
it
always
gets
me
yes
cut
to
the
two
of
them
walking
along
the
colonnade
i
mean
it's
incredible
one
day
the
campus
is
completely
bare
empty
the
next
there
are
children
everywhere
like
locusts
crawling
around
mindlessly
bent
on
feeding
and
mating
destroying
everything
in
sight
in
their
relentless
pointless
desire
to
exist
they
stop
snyder
looks
around
observing
the
students
i
do
enjoy
these
pep
talks
have
you
ever
considered
given
your
abhorrence
of
children
school's
principal
was
not
perhaps
your
true
vocation
somebody's
got
to
keep
an
eye
on
them
they're
just
a
bunch
of
hormonal
time
bombs
snyder
takes
two
steps
away
from
giles
every
time
a
pretty
girl
walks
by
every
boy
turns
into
a
gibbering
fool
giles

jenny
coming
towards
them
ms
calendar
mr
giles
well
i
uh
um
hello
you
see
the
way
these
kids
gaze
at
each
other
all
moony
it's
good
to
see
you
yes
you
think
they're
thinking
about
learning
uh
were
you
headed
to
the
uh
faculty
room
sounds
like
fun
they
head
off
to
the
faculty
room
leaving
snyder
behind
i
try
and
tell
'em
about
the
important
things
in
life
discipline
responsibility
punctuality
might
as
well
be
talking
to
myself
cut
inside
to
the
halls
they
walk
through
the
student
lounge
how
was
your
summer
extreme
i
did
burning
man
in
black
rock
ohhh
such
a
great
festival
you
should've
been
there
they
had
drum
rituals
mobile
sculptures
raves
naked
mud
dances
you
would've
just
hated
it
with
a
fiery
passion
i
can't
imagine
finding
any
redeeming
uh
giles
stops
at
the
base
of
the
stairs
naked
hmm
and
you
probably
spent
all
summer
with
your
nose
in
a
book
yes
i
suppose
you'd
consider
that
frightfully
dull
depends
on
the
book
jenny
smiles
willow
and
xander
come
down
the
stairs
buffy
is
not
far
behind
them
giles

a
vampire
last
night
they
all
look
around

can
get
a
little
more
volume
if
you
speak
from
the
diaphragm
sorry
jenny
quietly
we've
got
vampires
i
thought
the
hellmouth
was
closed
well
it's
it's
closed
but
not
gone
the
mystical
energy
that
emanates
from
it
is
still
concentrated
in
this
area
which
means
we're
still
the
undead's
favorite
party
town
i
wonder
if
they're
here
for
any
purpose
particularly
you're
the
watcher
i
just
work
here

consult
my
books

eight
minutes

thirtythree

buffy
giles
she
looks
back

i
realize

leaves
cut
to
the
library
after
school
buffy
does
tumbling
and
kicking
exercises
that
take
her
all
around
the
library
then
they
continue
training
with
the
quarterstaff
buffy
swings
it
at
giles'
hand
pads
he
retreats
as
she
hits
he
ducks
a
swing
but
she
continues
around
with
the
quarterstaff
and
knocks
him
back
into
the
chairs
by
the
table
next
she
practices
her
punches
on
the
wooden
punching
dummy
she
has
a
flash
of
the
master
and
begins
to
go
crazy
on
it
throwing
continuous
rapid
punches
buffy
that's
enough
she
keeps
whaling
on
the
dummy
buffy
she
kicks
it
and
it
breaks
uh
safe
to
say
you've
stayed
in
shape
buffy
breathing
hard
i'm
ready
whatever
they've
got
coming

old
brick
warehouse

lost
our
way
we
have
lost
the
night
but
despair
is
for
the
living
where
they
are
weak
we
will
be
strong
where
they
weep
we
rejoice
where
they
bleed
absalom
laughs
we
drink
within
three
days
a
new
hope
will
arise
we
will
put
our
faith
in

takes
a
hard
backhand
swing
at
her
face
knocking
her
down
onto
the
table
between
the
two
couches
he
gets
on
top
of
her
and
begins
to
choke
her
xander
and
willow
just
sit
on
the
couches
and
chew
away
at
their
food
willow
smiles
at
xander
buffy
reaches
up
to
giles'
face
and
tries
to
push
him
off
she
claws
at
him
and
suddenly
pulls
off
a
mask
revealing
the
master
underneath
buffy
stares
up
at
him
in
wideeyed
terror
cut
to
buffy's
bedroom
she
wakes
from
her
nightmare
with
a
start
she
looks
around
and
over
at
her
open
window
she
sits
up
and
rubs
her
face
when
she
looks
back
at
her
window
again
angel
is
there
leaning
against
the
sill
hello

if
i
come

my
guest
how

you
peachy

it
is
for
me
anyway
what
is
it
for
you
lunch
hour
it's
not
a
social
call
ah
so
lemme
guess
that
means
grave
danger
gosh
it's
good
to
be
home
i'm
sorry
i
wish
i
had
better
news
so
some
of
your

anointed
one

been
gathering
forces
somewhere
in
town

not

why
guess
i'll
find
out
soon
enough
huh
you
don't
sound
too
concerned
i
can
handle
myself
besides
i
could
use
a
little
action
anyway
don't
underestimate
the
anointed
one
just
because
he
looks
like
a
child
he
has
power
over
the
rest
of
them
they'll
do
anything
for
him
is
that
it
is
that
everything
y'know
'cause
you
woke
me
up
from
a
really
good
dream
she
turns
away
from

goes
over
to
her
hi
hi

i
beware

can't
help
thinking

done
something
to
make
you
angry
and
that
bothers
me
more
than
i'd
like
i'm
not
angry
i
don't
know
where
that
comes
from
what
are
you
afraid
of
me
us
could
you
contemplate
getting
over
yourself
for
a
second
there's
no
'us'
look
angel
i'm
sorry
if
i
was
supposed
to
spend
the
summer
mooning
over
you
but
i
didn't
i
moved
on
to
the
living
she
heads
over
to
willow
and
xander's
table
cordelia
watches
her
go
by
and
wonders
about
her
attitude
i'm
on
a
concrete
way
the
wind
is
blowing
hey
hi
hey
to
the
northnorthwest

pulls
at
his
shirt
oookay
xander

shirt
to
the
dance
floor
when
a
black
cat
crosses
my
path
buffy
and
xander
begin
to
slow
dance
her
movements
are
very
sensual
a
woman

against
him

reaches
up
with

angel
looks
on
jealously
willow
watches
in
disbelief
buffy
continues
her
grinding
i'm
riding
on
a
camel
that
has
big
eyes
the
buildings
are
changing
into
coconut
trees
little
by
little
buffy
turns
to
xander
and
tilts
her
head
up
to
his
close
enough
to
kiss
xander
did
i
ever
thank
you
for
saving
my
life
when
a
black
cat
no
crosses
my
path
buffy
slowly
slithers
around
him
making
sure
not
to
lose
contact
with
his
body
a
woman
in
the
moon
is
singing
to
the
earth
don't
you
wish
i
would
she
breaks
off
leaving
him
standing
there
xander
isn't
sure
what
to
make
of
it
all
but
he
knows
he
doesn't
like
it
a
woman
in
the
moon
is
singing
to
the
earth
buffy
goes
back
to
their
table
and
retrieves
her
jacket
la
la
la
la
la
la
la
la
la
she
walks
past
cordelia
as
she
makes
her
way
out
of
the
bronze
angel
follows
her
with
his
stare
la
la
la
la
la
la
la
la
la
xander
is
still
standing
on
the
dance
floor
upset
and
unsure
how
to
react
cut
outside
buffy
exits
the
bronze
and
walks
down
the
alley
at
a
quick
pace
cordelia
follows
her
out
buffy
cordelia
buffy
stops
you're
really
campaigning
for
bitchof
theyear
aren't
you
buffy
turns
to
face
her
as
defending
champion
you
nervous
i
can
hold
my
own
you
know
we've
never
really
been
close
which
is
nice
'cause
i
don't
really
like
you
that
much
but
you
have
on
occasion
saved
the
world
and
stuff
so
i'm
gonna
do
you
a
favor
and
this
great
favor
is
i'm
gonna
give
you
some
advice
get
over
it
excuse
me
whatever
is
causing
the
joan
collins
'tude
deal
with
it
embrace
the
pain
spank
your
inner
moppet
whatever
but
get
over
it
'cause
pretty
soon
you're
not
even
gonna
have
the
loser
friends
you've
got
now
i
think
it's
about
time
you
start
minding
your
own
business
it's
long
past
buffy
turns
and
goes
nightynight
buffy
flips
up
her
hood
i'll
just
see
if
angel
feels
like
dancing
she
is
suddenly
grabbed
by
two
vampires
coming
out
of
the
shadows
and
dragged
into
an
adjacent
building
part
3

a
basement
the
two
vampires
force
cordelia
down
the
stairs
at
the
bottom
they
shove
her
into
the
room
she's
frightened
and
looks
around
she
takes
a
step
sideways
and
bumps
into
a
hand
she
looks
down
and
sees
that
it's
jenny
she
crouches
down
to
see
if
she's
okay
but
jenny
is
unconscious
ms
ms
calendar
oh
god
ms
calendar
cut
to
the
cemetery
buffy
is
going
to
check
out
the
master's
grave
when
she
gets
there
she
finds
it
dug
open
and
his
bones
exhumed
she
steps
back
slowly
and
thinks
she
sees
the
master
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
she
quickly
turns
to
look
but
no
one's
there
she's
possessed
cut
to
the
student
lounge
giles
is
getting
a
soda
from
the
vending
machine
possessed
that's
the
only
explanation
that
makes
any
sense
i
mean
you
should've
seen
her
last
night
that
wasn't
buffy
are
we
overlooking
the
idea
that
she
may
be
very
attracted
to
me
xander
gets
looks
from
the
others
and
concedes
she's
possessed
possessed
by
what
aaaaa
possessing
thing
giles
sarcastically
well
that
narrows
it
down
he
takes
a
sip
of
his
soda
and
winces
at
its
sweetness
well
you're
the
expert
hey
maybe
when
the
master
killed
her
some
mystical
bad
guy
transference
thing
happened
that's
what
it
was
i
mean
why
else
would
she
be
acting
like
such
a
bitch
willow
i
think
we're
all
a
little
too
old
to
be
spelling
things
out
a
bitca
giles
not
surprised
by
xander's
misunderstanding
yes
i
suggest
that
uh
the
explanation
for
her
behavior
may
be
something
more
more
mundane
the
bell
rings
and
the
students
around
them
begin
to
leave
for
class
giles
sits
she
may
simply
have
what
you
americans
refer
to
as
issues
uh
her
experience
with
the
master
must
have
been
extremely
traumatic
well
she
was
for
at
least
a
few
minutes
technically
dead
giles
buffy
appears
in
the
door
ii
don't
think
she's
dealt
with
that
on
a
conscious
level
giles
xander
notices
buffy
she's
convinced
herself
that
she's
invulnerable
for
the
very
reason
that
she
feels
xander
interrupts
that's
a
very
interesting
point
about
trout
you
just
brought
up
now
buffy
walks
up
to
them
trout
giles
notices
buffy
trout
yes
trout
iis
a
fish
good
morning
did
you
sleep
well
like
a
rock
master's
gone
i'm
sorry
the
master
i
went
by
his
grave
last
night
and
they
have
a
vacancy
good
god
what
would
somebody
want
with
master
bones
a
trophy
a
horrible
conversation
piece
they're
gonna
bring
him
back
they're
gonna
bring
the
master
back
to
life
and
i
seem
to
recall
you
telling
me
he
was
history
buffy
iii've
never
heard
of
aa
revivification
ritual
being
successful
but
you've
heard
of
them
thanks
for
the
warning
well
buffy
giles
did
bury
him
and
look
this
is
slayer
stuff
okay
could
we
have
just
a
little
less
from
the
civilians
please
okay
that's
just
about
enough
buffy
shoots
xander
a
look
snyder
interrupts
i
believe
some
of
us
have
class
and
some
of
us
have
jobs
yyes
well
i'll
uh
i'll
see
you
all
uh
in
the
library
later
we'll
we'll
continue
this
discussion
about
trout
the
kids
leave
snyder
watches
them
go
there're
some
things
i
can
just
smell
it's
like
a
sixth
sense
no
actually
that
would
be
one
of
the
five
that
summers
girl
i
smell
trouble
i
smell
expulsion
and
just
the
faintest
aroma
of
jail
well
before
you
throw
away
the
key
you
might
consider
giving
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
she
may
surprise
you
you
really
have
faith
in
those
kids
don't
you
yes
i
do
weird
cut
to
the
library
after
school
alright
alright
iii've
got
something
it's
latin
so
bear
with
me
uh
to
revive
the
vampire
they
need
his
bones
uh
wwhich
they
have
and
um
the
blood
this
is
very
unclear
of
the
closest
person
uh
someone
connected
to
the
vampire
that'd
be
me
perhaps
we
were
close
we
killed
each
other
it
really
promotes
togetherness
well
is
there
anything
on
when
the
ceremony
might
take
a
rock
comes
crashing
through
a
window
whoa
buffy
catches
the
rock
in
her
hands
it
has
a
note
wrapped
around
it
and
kept
in
place
with
a
bracelet
this
is
cordelia's
buffy
takes
off
the
note
'come
to
the
bronze
before
it
opens
or
we
make
her
a
meal'
xander
they're
gonna
cook
her
dinner
buffy
gets
looks
from
everyone
i'll
pretend
i
didn't
say
that
what
do
we
do
buffy
exhales
i
go
to
the
bronze
and
save
the
day
buffy
starts
to
go
i
don't
like
this
nor
i
buffy
turns
back
yeah
well
you
guys
aren't
going
what
do
you
mean
i
can't
do
it
anymore
i
can't
look
after
the
three
of
you
guys
while
i'm
fighting
well
what
about
the
rest
of
the
note
what
rest
of
the
note
the
part
that
says
'ps
this
is
a
trap'
you'll
be
playing
straight
into
their
hands
giles
takes
off
his
glasses
i
can
handle
this
stop
saying
that
god
what's
wrong
with
you
cordelia
may
be
dead
this
is
my
fight
she
leaves
and
grabs
her
coat
and
bag
on
the
way
out
willow
just
watches
her
go
xander
shakes
his
head
giles
puts
his
glasses
back
on
cut
to
the
alley
outside
the
bronze
buffy
senses
angel
as
she
nears
the
entrance
y'know
being
stalked
isn't
really
a
big
turnon
for
girls
angel
behind
her
you
need
help
someone
to
watch
your
back
sure
you
don't
mean
my
neck
angel
comes
around
her
why
are
you
ridin'
me
because
i
don't
trust
you
you're
a
vampire
buffy
gets
a
look
oh
i'm
sorry
was
that
an
offensive
term
should
i
say
'undead
american'
you
have
to
trust
someone
you
can't
do
this
alone
i
trust
me
you're
not
as
strong
as
you
think
buffy
gives
him
a
challenging
look
you
think
you
can
take
me
what
oh
c'mon
i
mean
you
must've
thought
about
it
what
would
happen
if
it
ever
came
down
to
a
fight
you
vampire
me
the
slayer
i
mean
you
must've
wondered
well
why
don't
we
find
out
i'm
not
gonna
fight
you
come
on
kick
my
ass
don't
you
have
somewhere
to
be
i
do
well
you're
wasting
time
just
stay
out
of
my
way
buffy
walks
around
him
to
the
entrance
happy
to
oblige
cut
inside
buffy
comes
in
and
looks
around
as
she
slowly
walks
through
an
empty
bronze
she
comes
upon
a
girl
crying
in
a
corner
she
stops
angel
appears
behind
her
that's
not
cordelia
the
vampire
laughs
and
turns
around
cordelia
couldn't
make
it
where
is
she
i'm
not
supposed
to
tell
i
don't
like
this
don't
like
what
there's
the
bait
where's
the
hook
the
vampire
attacks
and
buffy
flips
her
over
onto
her
back
on
the
floor
and
pins
her
down
with
her
foot
you're
right
why
would
they
send
just
one
cut
to
the
library
giles
is
continuing
his
research
i
still
think
we
should've
gone
with
her
buffy's
about
to
lose
it
i
think
we
should
be
trying
to
reach
minimum
safe
distance
xander
you
know
it's
a
trap
ah
ah
ah
ah
uh
uh
the
latin
is
is
translated
from
the
sumerian
aaand
rather
badly
closest
to
the
master
actually
translates
as
'nearest'
physically
the
the
the
person
or
persons
who
were
with
him
when
he
giles
looks
up
it
is
a
trap
several
vampires
appear
on
the

vehemently
if

hurt
willow
i'll
kill

she
turns
back
to
him
and
looks
at
him
seriously
why
did
they
take
them
and
not
you
giles
said
the
ritual
was
um
they
needed
people
who
were
close
to
the

close
when
he
uh
the
ones
who
were
with
the
master
when

bends
down
and
picks
up
the
sledgehammer

slowly
walks
over
to
the
master's
skeleton
and
looks
at

a
moment

she
swings
the
hammer
back
behind
her
and
arcs
it
directly
into
the
master's
skull
shattering
it
to
pieces
she
keeps
whaling
on
the
master's
skeleton
as
willow
xander
and
giles
look
down
from
above
angel
comes
up
behind
her
and
watches
her
continue
until

nothing
left
on

stops
and
bursts
into
tears
dropping
the
sledgehammer
to
the
floor

leans
into

buffy
looks
at

a
rumor

entire
world
