buffy
and
kathy
are
in
their
dorm
room
kathy
has
an
ironing
board
out
and
is
ironing
jeans
buffy

reading
a
cd
jewel
case
cher's
'believe'
is
playing
on
kathy's
portable
stereo
wow

so
so
i
know
this
song

funer
and
funer
every
time
you
playit
buffy
gets
a
jacket
from
her
closet
going
out
yeah
i'm
seriously
caffeine
deprived
figure
i'd
head
down
to
the
grotto
and
get
a
jolt
and
you
know
do
some
studying
oh
it's
late
won't
you
be
up
all
night
buffy
picking
up
her
backpack
oh
yeah
but
it's
cool
i'm
sort
of
an
'up'
kind
of
night
person
i
mentioned
that
right
i
guess
i
just
didn't
realize
you'd
be
coming
and
going
at
all
hours
well
not
that
i
mind
i'm
just
surprised
i'll
be
quiet
as
a
mouse
i
promise
ok
buffy
starts
toward
the
door
oh
say
buffy
i
wanted
to
show
you
this
little
system
i
implemented
kathy
goes
over
to
the
nightstand
separating
the
beds
and
gets
a
small
notepad
and
a
pen
bringing
them
back
oh
goody
system
just
log
every
call
you
make
in
here
and
that
way
when
the
bill
comes
it
won't
be
a
problem
i
figure
'stitch
in
time'
'catches
the
worm'
kathy
cheerfully
makes
a
'you
got
it'
gesture
you
bet
ok
then
buffy
turns
and
starts
to
go
also
kathy
buffy
stops
and
turns
back

that

of
my
milk

of
put
me
on
edge
oh
kathy's

an
adjustment

of
challenging

branching
path
say
'hey'

oz
for
me
happy
hunting
wish

monsters
willow
makes
a
'ick'
gesture
and
walks
away
buffy
walks
on
not
noticing
a
hooded
orange
skinned
demon
with
green
glowing
eyes
watching
her
from
the
bushes
opening
credits

buffy
walking
along
a
path
hears
a
noise
will
buffy
pauses
alright
why
don't
you
quit
hiding
and
come
out
and
face
me
like
a
thing
kathy
comes
running
up
with
a
bounce
in
her
step
hey
i
caught
you
is
everything
ok
oh
everything's
super
i
just
decided
a
decaf
latte
sounded
like
heaven
after
all
so
you're
coming
along
why
not
this
way
you
won't
have
to
walk
these
spooky
paths
alone
kathy
goes
on
ahead
with
a
skip
great
buffy
in
a
low
voice
that's
just
great
buffy
follows
this
is
neat
isn't
it
the
fresh
air
the
trees
the
smell
of
buffy
hears
the
growl
of
something
rushing
them
and
pushes
kathy
into
the
bushes
where
she
lands
in
the
dirt
the
same
demon
from
before
runs
up
and
swings
a
club
buffy
grabs
it's
arm
breaks
it's
hold
on
the
club
and
throws
it
off
balance
onto
the
ground
it
gets
up
and
takes
two
swings
but
buffy
blocks
them
and
gives
it
three
quick
rights
to
the
face
kathy
in
the
bushes
gets
to
her
knees
looking
dazed
the
demon
tries
a
roundhouse
punch
which
buffy
ducks
under
she
sweeps
the
demon's
legs
out
from
under
him
and
he
rolls
over
his
club
grabbing
it
rolling
to
his
feet
he
runs
off
kathy
climbs
out
of
the
bushes
and
buffy
goes
to
help
her
what
the
blizzard
was
that
all
about
uh
he
um
tried
to
take
my
backpack
what
were
you
thinking
taking
him
on
like
that
oh
i
heh
i
don't
know
i
guess
ii
panicked
i
mean
it's
just
you
could
of
gotten
hurt
or
something
kathy
looks
down
and
look
at
my
sweater

ruined

you
cleaned
up

way

came
in
the
bushes
a
demon
watches
them
go
another
demon
comes
up
beside
him
they
speak
in
subtitles
a
strangely
visual
demon
language
she
may
be
the
one
we
have
to
be
sure

her
as
you
wish
daytime
in
the
courtyard
outside
giles'
apartment
there's
a
fountain

table
and
chairs

is
going
through
his
mail
boring
boring
bill
bill
giles
comes
running
down
the
stairs
wearing
exercise
clothes
complete
with
sneakers
he's
panting
hello
giles

run
and
jump
and
bend

with
the
motorbike
and
scooter

i'm
a
mod
jogger

one
of
those
midlife
things
are
you
'cause
i'm
still
going
'ick'
from
the
last
time
you
tried
to
recapture
your
youth
buffy
sorry
buffy
sits
down
at
a
table
demon
last
night
made
with
the
pummeling
but
he
got
away
what
sort
of
demon
giles
crosses
to
the
fountain
and
sits
on
it's
outer
ledge
umm
had
a
cloak
on
and
glowing
green
eyes
and
skin
had
a
like
superbad
fake
rubon
tan
translate
orangey
thank
you
anything
else
my
roommate
kathy
was
there
but
she
didn't
see
anything
you
took
your
roommate
patrolling
with
you
well
i
invited
the
whole
dorm
but
she
was
the
only
one
that
could
make
it
buffy
the
look
on
giles'
face
tells
buffy
that
he
didn't
get
the
sarcasm
i
told
her
i
was
going
for
coffee
and
she
decided
to
tag
along
right
well
we
should
discourage
her
from
that
habit
from
what
you
described
ii'm
not
familiar
with
the
creature
but
ii'll
look
into
it
and
give
you
a
ring
when
i've
found
something
giles
gets
up
and
starts
moving
toward
his
apartment
you
know
it's
nice
out
here
giles
turning
back
yes
i
take
my
tea
out
here
sometimes
giles
starts
to
go
again
what
are
you
doing
today
giles
turns
back
again
uh
it's
a
good
day
for
me
actually
a
friend
of
mine
recently
acquired
auh
an
original
gutenberg
demonography
and
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
you've
never
once
asked
me
what
my
day's
plans
were
which
leads
me
to
inquire
whether
you're
feeling
entirely
yourself
that's
not
true
i
ask
about
you
all
the
time
buffy
gives
her
a
look
ok
well
maybe
the
words
don't
actually
make
it
out
of
my
mouth
but
i
think
about
it
and
it's
appreciated
which
doesn't
explain
why
you're
hanging
around
here
instead
of
rushing
off
as
usual
it's
no
big
i
just
figured
i'd
hang
hereyou
know—until
my
roommate
goes
to
class
ah
i
see
giles
sits
back
down
on
the
fountain
i
know
it's
probably
just
me
having
a
bitch
attack
but
it's
not
me
buffy
living
with
somebody
is
never
easy
especially
for
an
only
child
giles
listen
to
me
ok
when
she
sharpens
her
pencils
she
measures
them
with
a
ruler
to
make
sure
they're
all
the
same
size
which
is
fussy
i
agree
but
everybody
has
their
idiosyncrasies
you'd
do
well
to
learn
to
tolerate
them
or
i'll
end
up
an
old
lady
who
can
only
live
with
cats
something
like
that
buffy
ok
you
know
what
you're
right
giles
stands
up
take
a
mental
pic
this
is
the
new
buffy
kinder
gentler
roommate
extraordinaire
in
the
dorm
room
kathy
is
trying
without
much
luck
to
get
the
stain
out
of
her
sweater
she
looks
down
and
sees
that
one
corner
of
a
throw
rug
is
turned
up
and
leans
down
to
straighten
it
she
gives
up
on
the
sweater
and
looks
over
at
buffy's
closet
door
she
gets
up
walks
over
unlatches
the
bolt
holding
it
closed
and
opens
the
door
she
picks
out
a
sweater
and
while
looking
at
it
notices
a
satchel
with
part
of
a
crossbow
sticking
out
she
opens
the
satchel
and
takes
out
a
really
cool
looking
pistol
grip
crossbow
and
a
wooden
cross
she
pauses
for
a
moment
holding
them
then
puts
them
back
at
the
university
dining
hall
called
the
rocket
cafe
buffy
gets
a
tray
and
starts
back
to
the
end
of
the
line
she
notices
kathy
and
quickly
brings
the
tray
up
to
hide
her
face
she
ducks
into
the
line
in
front
of
a
male
student
the
young
man
takes
a
quick
peek
behind
him
and
turns
back
to
buffy
exboyfriend
or
loan
shark
buffy
turns
around
to
face
him
excuse
me
the
person
you're
hiding
from
oh
both
ugly
breakup
i'm
sorry
i
just
cut
you
no
stay
stay
i'll
watch
your
back
they
get
to
the
selfserve
area
and
start
getting
their
food
freshman
huh
is
it
that
obvious
there
are
signs
parker
gets
a
singleserving
box
of
cereal
and
stuffs
it
into
the
breast
pocket
of
his
shirt
for
instance
people
who've
been
around
for
awhile
know
how
to
use
their
dining
hall
card
it's
not
for
food
work
it
right
and
you
can
get
three
meals
worth
which
equals
fewer
punch
cards
used
annually
and
more
cash
from
dad
which
you
get
to
keep
for
yourself
right
the
goal
is
to
polish
off
as
much
as
humanly
possible
at
one
sitting
enough
to
get
you
through
the
rest
of
the
day
if
necessary
while
chipmunking
items
for
future
consumption
ahh
got
it
excess
dry
goods
fit
nicely
in
a
backpack
or
your
pocket
parker
takes
something
and
puts
it
into
his
pants
pocket
the
wetter
itemsmacaronies
your
turkey
loafthen
you're
into
ziplocks
it's
not
for
beginners
i'll
just
take
it
slow
they
reach
the
cashier
and
hand
over
their
cards
for
punching
buffy
looks
over
and
sees
willow
xander
and
oz
seated
at
a
table
willow
sees
her
and
waves
for
her
to
come
over
so
so
those
are
my
buffy
sees
the
gang

the
table

willow
indicates
parker
seated
across
the
room
what
was
that
all
about
with
the
cutie
patootie
i
don't
know
nothing
big
i
think
just
random
adorableness
oh
a
technique
i
know
well
hit
the
girl
with
your
best
shot
then
hasta
gotta
respect
the
driveby
low
rejection
fond
memories
it
looked
like
more
than
that
to
me
he
got
all
googlyeyed
that's
because
he
got
hit
by
the
buffinator
now
he's
powerless
you
think
no
question
he'll
be
back
buffy
smiles
so
what
else
is
up
with
the
buff
any
vamp
action
i
did
get
jumped
by
a
demon
of
nonspecific
origin
last
night
yeah
something
apocalypsey
do
we
need
to
assemble
the
scooby
gang
buffy
holding
back
a
laugh
no
but
thank

i
you
just
need

the
basement

little
more
there
xand
kathy
comes
up
and
sets
her
tray
on
the
table

kathy
gets
a
chair
from
another
table
and
moves
it
over
squeeze
in
you

my
roomie
kathy
hi

that
my
sweater
i
didn't
think
you'd
mind
i
mean
you
got
mine
all
muddy
i
was
saving
you
from
a
bear
buffy
giving
willow
a
look
mugger
it's
not
a
problem
is
it
i
mean
i
figured
we're
almost
like
sisters
now
living
together
and
everything
no
it's
it's
fine
i
just
wished
you'd
asked
so
where're
you
from
kathy
nebraska
originally
kathy
picks
up
a
big
sloppy
hamburger
from
her
tray
ahh
yes
big
sky
country
kathy
bites
into
her
sandwich
buffy's
senses
intensify
focusing
in
on
a
blob
of
ketchup
oozing
out
of
the
hamburger
she
watches
it
as
it
drops
onto
her
sweater
buffy's
eyes
narrow
that
night
in
the
dorm
buffy
is
talking
to
willow
on
the
phone
the
window
at
the
head
of
her
bed
is
open
i
mean
can
you
believe
her
first
she
acts
like
she
has
sit
privileges
at
my
lunch
table
just
because
some
computer
had
to
make
us
cellmates
buffy
puts
a
stick
of
gum
in
her
mouth
i'm
sure
it's
not
easy
for
her
she's
not
like
you
she
doesn't
know
anybody
here
fine
but
what
about
my
sweater
you
can't
believe
the
stuff
that
i
have
to
put
up
with
willow's
dorm
room
there's
a
loud
party
going
on
willows
on
her
bed
with
the
phone
yeah
i
guess
it's
hard
uh
but
i'm
sure
the
sweater
thing
was
an
accident
a
nerf
football
hits
her
in
the
head
i
don't
know
will
i
think
she's
just
coming
back
from
the
bathroom
i'll
call
you
back
kathy
coming
into
the
room
don't
forget
to
log
those
calls
kathy
sits
on
her
bed
and
starts
flossing
her
teeth
buffy
takes
an
apple
out
of
her
backpack
and
takes
it
over
to
the
minirefrigerator
while
she's
up
kathy
gets
up
and
closes
the
window
buffy
opens
the
fridge
and
sees
that
kathy
has
almost
completely
filled
it
labeling
everything
with
her
name
even
writing
'kathy'
on
each
of
a
dozen
boiled
eggs
buffy
squeezes
the
apple
into
the
last
remaining
space
on
the
door
closes
it
and
turns
around
to
see
the
window
is
now
closed
she
goes
over
and
opens
it
again
and
sits
back
down
on
her
bed
kathy
finishes
flossing
and
picks
up
a
paperback
book
from
the
nightstand
there
is
gum
stuck
to
it
and
it
stretches
up
from
the
table
ewww
who
left
their
gum
here
buffy
pauses
gum
gnome
it
wasn't
me
it
had
to
be
somebody
buffy
buffy
swallows
the
gum
she
had
been
chewing
i
don't
know
kathy
slams
the
book
down
and
turns
off
the
light
near
her
bed
buffy
turns
off
her
own
light
lays
down
pulling
the
covers
over
her
and
falls
asleep
she
dreams
of
a
demon
very
much
like
the
one
she
fought
holding
her
down
poring
blood
in
her
mouth
putting
a
scorpion
on
her
bare
skin
and
drawing
a
light
gossamer
substance
out
of
buffy's
mouth
and
into
it's
own
she
awakes
with
a
start
kathy
is
looking
at
her
from
her
own
bed
do
you
always
make
that
noise
when
you
sleep
scene
transitions

daytime
and
buffy
giles
willow
and
oz
are
seated
in
comfortable
padded
chairs
in
an
open
area
lounge
so
then
after
the
scorpion
the
demon
opened
my
mouth
and
sucked
some
kind
of
weird
light
out
of
me
aand
the
worst
part
i
wake
up
and
there's
kathy
staring
at
me
like
i'm
some
kind
of
freak
well
actually
the
worst
part
i'd
have
to
go
with
the
demon
poring
the
blood
down
your
throat
me
too
i
would
vote
for
that
too
but
that's
just
a
dream
and
this
kathy
thing
is
real
all
she
cared
about
was
that
her
precious
sleep
had
been
disturbed
kathy
comes
up
behind
giles
perhaps
it
would
be
more
productive
to
examine
your
dreams
um
determine
there
meaning
you
can
read
dreams
neat
giles
kathy
kathy
giles
he's
our
grownup
friend
nnot
in
a
creepy
way
nice
to
meet
you
kathy
ditto
maybe
you
could
read
the
dream
i
had
last
night
there
was
like
this
monster
and
he
sat
on
me
and
did
all
this
stuff
to
me
stuff
like
scorpions
and
bloody
mary
minus
the
mary
that's
it
how'd
you
know
well
i'm
a
good
guesser
me
too
and
i'm
guessing
that
you
need
to
be
on
your
way
to
class
right
kath
hmm
hmm
sounds
like
somebody
woke
up
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
bed
this
morning
hmm
hmm
and
guess
what
you
were
next
to
it
you
know
i
do
need
to
dash
my
whole
schedule
is
off
because
someone
kept
me
up
all
night
well
it's
been
fun
toodles
kathy
turns
and
leaves
toodles
giles
clears
his
throat
you
know
what
this
means
yes
not
only
does
she
take
my
sweater
but
now
she
has
to
horn
in
on
my
dreams
she
is
the
most
ever
mooch
oh
i
haven't
even
gotten
to
the
floss
buffy
focus
please
if
kathy
and
you
are
having
the
same
nightmares
chances
are
something
happened
to
you
both
when
you
met
the
demon
in
the
woods
so
we
need
to
figure
out
if
this
ritual
their
dreaming
about
has
some
special
use
or
meaning
buffy
getting
up
and
gathering
her
things
cool
you
guys
can
do
the
brain
thing
i'm
gonna
go
to
class
which
could
also
be
construed
as
the
brain
thing
not
when
you're
minoring
in
'napping
101'
buffy
leaves
ok
so
that
was
the
evil
twin
right
'cause
she
was
bordering
on
cordeliaesque
well
she's
definitely
pushing
the
stress
meter
on
this
kathy
thing
i
concur
she's
not
uh
herself
but
you
know
uh
learning
to
live
with
someone
can
be
a
challenge
aand
she
hasn't
been
sleeping
right
then
giles
stands
nothing
to
get
to
concerned
about
still
let
me
know
if
she
um
hits
the
red
zone
yes
nighttime
in
a
secluded
wooded
area
demon2
has
a
campfire
burning
demon1
walks
up
they
still
speak
in
subtitles
we
were
correct
she
is
the
one
good
i
have
prepared
for
the
summoning
of
the
great
one
taparrich
they
remove
their
hoods
revealing
bald
heads
face
the
fire
and
begin
chanting
buffy
returning
to
the
dorm
room
stops
at
the
door
for
a
second
when
she
hears
cher's
'believe'
playing
again
she
goes
in
and
sees
parker
half
lying
on
kathy's
bed
with
kathy
sitting
with
him
they're
talking
lots
of
popular
artists

get
their
dues
madonna

parker
parker
getting

going
over

to
maximize
your
dining
hall
exports

heavy
duty
buffy
reading
the
box
plus
freezer

so
kathy
gets
up

close
to
parker
looking
at
him
while
she
talks
to
buffy
parker
was
just
going
to
leave
his

kathy
laughs

a
blast
and
time
just
flew
time
really
how
much
time

not
sure
we
sort
of
got
caught
up
talking
red
wings
it
turns
out
that
kathy's
a
closet

the
violence
kathy
laughs

it
i
told
you

just
between

be
the
sweaty

it
outside
i've
got
a
lot
of
work

music

wave
kathy
waving

seeya
buffy
sees
him
out
closes
the
door
and
turns
to
face
kathy
it

have
killed
you
to
be
nice
you
know
buffy
crossing
over
to
her
bed
she
retrieves
something
from
her
bag
looked
like
you
were
being
nice
enough
for
the
both
of
us
kathy
closing
the
window
i
wasn't
moving
in
on
your
territory
if
that's
what
you
mean
buffy
locking
the
bolt
on
her
closet
with
a
padlock
right
just
like
you
didn't
destroy
my
sweater
kathy
is
flossing
again
buffy
opens
the
window
i'm
cold
well
i'm
hot
deal
with
it
do
you
know
what
your
problem
is
buffy
you
hardly
your
problem
is
you're
spoiled
maybe
the
world
revolved
around
you
where
you
used
to
live
but
it's
share
time
now
share
time
huh
fine
i'll
show
you
share
time
she
goes
to
the
fridge
and
gets
out
the
carton
of
milk
and
drinks
it
straight
from
the
carton
spilling
it
all
over
herself
and
the
floor
willows
dorm
building
she
and
oz
walk
along
a
hall
you're
worried
about
her
yeah
both
of
them
i
mean
what
kind
of
demon
runs
around
putting
ookie
blood
dreams
into
people's
heads
like
some
kind
of
nightmare
fairy
it's
not
right
well
i'm
against
it
and
buffy's
completely
being
not
herself
if
it
wasn't
for
this
english
paper
i'd
be
there
right
now
um
listening
doing
the
girly
best
friend
thing
they
stop
at
the
door
to
her
room
well
i
can
do
that
you
can
well
i'm
not
saying
we'll
braid
each
others
hairprobably—but
i
can
hang
with
her
watch
for
signs
she's
going
over
the
edge
you're
the
best
oh
she's
probably
patrolling
by
now
check
around
the
science
center
if
you
need
me
i'll
be
willow
opens
the
door
hears
the
sounds
of
a
loud
party
and
closes
it
again
at
the
library
willow
goes
back
the
way
they
came
oz
walks
along
a
well
lighted
walkway
he
passes
a
group
of
three
people
two
men
and
a
young
woman
he
senses
something
he
looks
back
and
sees
that
the
woman
is
looking
back
at
him
they
look
at
each
other
for
a
few
seconds
before
they
both
turn
back
in
the
bushes
see
three
figures
in
camouflage
carrying
weapons
they
appear
to
be
following
the
group
that
oz
just
passed
oz
is
walking
with
buffy
along
a
path
so
then
kathy's
like
'it's
share
time'
and
i'm
like
'oh
yeah
share
this'
buffy
punches
at
the
air
so
either
you
hit
her
or
you
did
your
wacky
mime
routine
for
her
well
i
didn't
do
either
actually
but
she
deserves
it
don't
you
think
nobody
deserves
a
mime
buffy
hmm
kathy
does
she
deserves
to
be
locked
in
an
invisible
box
and
blown
away
by
an
imaginary
wind
and
and
forced
to
wear
a
binding
unitard
yeah
the
itchy
kind
it's
perfect
just
here
to
help
which
i
appreciate
but
you've
never
come
on
routine
patrol
with
me
before
oz
so
what's
the
deal
seemed
more
interesting
than
homework
as
long
as
it's
an
elective
i
can
handle
myself
alone
you
know
not
in
question
good
so
then
i
go
into
the
refrigeratorrightand
the
label
queen
has
managed
to
put
just
a
just
a
thought
buffy
but
do
you
think
all
this
ranting
is
scaring
away
potential
demons
they
stop
you're
right
ooh
she's
even
affecting
my
work
now
she's
the
titanic
she's
a
crawling
black
cancer
buffy
brings
her
foot
up
around
and
down
onto
a
bench
breaking
it
in
two
she's
other
really
bad
things
on
the
plus
side
you've
killed
the
bench
which
was
looking
shifty
this
isn't
funny
oz
something
has
to
be
done
buffy
walks
away
looking
determined
oz
pauses
agreed
oz
follows
her
back
in
her
dorm
room
buffy
is
at
her
desk
studying
she
looks
over
at
kathy
who
is
on
her
bed
clipping
her
toenails
her
senses
intensify
and
she
hears
every
nail
being
clipped
as
a
loud
'clank'
and
focuses
on
every
clipping
in
slow
motion
flying
through
the
air
and
onto
the
floor
she
starts
tapping
her
pencil
on
her
open
book
kathy
looks
over
and
her
senses
intensify
she
hears
every
tap
as
a
loud
'boom'
she
gets
up
goes
over
to
her
stereo
and
starts
playing
cher's
'believe'
again
buffy
taps
harder
until
she
breaks
the
pencil
she
puts
on
earmuffs
and
it
cuts
the
volume
of
the
music
down
a
little
kathy
goes
to
the
fridge
and
gets
out
a
boiled
egg
she
takes
it
to
her
desk
and
starts
rolling
it
on
the
desktop
to
break
the
shell
buffy's
senses
intensify
and
she
focuses
in
on
the
shell
with
'kathy'
written
on
it
cracking
she
watches
kathy
peel
the
broken
shell
from
the
egg
she
takes
off
the
earmuffs
and
throws
them
onto
the
desk
i'm
going
to
bed
buffy
gets
in
her
bed
turns
out
the
light
and
closes
her
eyes
buffy
dreams
of
the
demon
again
this
time
it's
painting
symbols
on
her
belly
before
drawing
the
light
gossamer
substance
out
of
her
mouth
and
into
it's
own
there's
a
shot
of
the
scorpion
on
her
bare
skin
again
and
she
awakens
to
daylight
with
a
start
over
in
her
own
bed
kathy
moans
and
opens
her
eyes
suddenly
oh
jeez
later
that
day
kathy
is
talking
to
willow
in
a
hallway
i
do
what
i
can
but
buffy's
difficult
she's
secretive
for
one
thing
she
comes
in
at
all
hours
of
the
night
she
leaves
her
gum
all
over
the
place
iit
sounds
like
things
are
rough
but
don't
you
want
to
be
talking
to
buffy
about
this
buffy
enters
the
hallway
at
one
end
and
sees
kathy
and
willow
she
stops
i
would
but
she
is
so
touchy
about
all
kinds
of
weird
stuff
i
mean
sometimes
i
get
the
feeling
that
she
is
not
quite
normal
you
know
buffy
stare
intently
at
them
well
normal
is
relative
right
they
both
look
over
and
see
buffy
later
ok
kathy
leaves
buffy
comes
up
beside
willow
and
turns
suddenly
buffy
accusingly
why
were
you
talking
to
her
buffy
come
on
we
were
only
just
saying
hi
yeah
that's
what
she
wants
you
to
think
buffy
this
has
to
stop
i
mean
ii
get
it
i
have
a
sucky
roomie
too
but
you
just
have
to
deal
you're
right
i've
been
thinking
a
lot
about
this
and
it's
clear
to
me
now
good
that's
better
kathy's
evil
i'm
an
evil
fighter
it's
simple
i'm
gonna
have
to
kill
her
scene
transitions

you
have
to
kill
her
don't
you
think
you
could
just
switch
rooms
or
something
well
i
would
but
it's
not
just
me
in
danger
from
kathy
look
buffy
opens
the
bottom
pocket
of
her
bag
and
takes
out
a
plastic
baggie
containing
toenail
clippings
toenails
evil
toenails
i
took
them
off
the
floor
last
night
when
she
was
in
the
bathroom
she
thought
i
was
asleep
good
thinking
'cause
in
the
middle
of
the
night
those
toenails
could
have
attacked
you
and
left
little
halfmoon
marks
all
over
your
body
don't
be
ridiculous
the
point
is
i
measured
them
before
i
fell
asleep
and
again
this
morning
and
they
grew
after
they
were
cut
that's
a
demon
thing
she
has
to
be
eliminated
of
course
iit
makes
sense
now
but
you
better
show
those
bad
puppies
to
giles
before
you
do
anything
just
to
be
sure
absolutely
i
don't
want
to
do
anything
crazy
uh
you
hurry
on
to
giles
i'll
hang
here
andand
keep
an
eye
on
kathy
great
good
thanks
will
buffy
leaves
willow
goes
to
a
nearby
payphone
and
punches
in
a
number
giles
ii
just
talked
to
buffy
and
yeah
i
think
she's
feeling
a
little
insane
no
nnot
bitchy
crazy
more
like
homicidal
maniac
crazy
so
i
told
her
to
come
to
you
kay
buffy
opens
the
door
to
giles'
apartment
no
one
is
there
she
walks
into
the
room
calling
giles
anybody
home
hello
a
net
falls
onto
her
from
above
xander
and
oz
come
running
out
of
the
hallway
giles
from
another
direction
they
jump
on
her
forcing
her
arms
behind
her
back
where
xander
loops
a
readymade
slip
knot
over
her
wrists
what
are
you
guys
doing
this
is
this
is
ridiculous
buffy
this
hurts
me
more
than
it
hurts
you
not
yet
but
it
will
don't
say
that
xander
stops
realizing
what
she'd
just
said
oh
please
don't
say
that
we're
doing
this
to
stop
you
from
making
a
terrible
mistake
they
remove
the
net
and
move
her
over
to
a
wooden
bench
with
a
back
to
it
clearly
something
is
amiss
xander
ties
the
other
end
of
the
rope
to
the
back
of
the
bench
yeah
something's
amiss
here
a
'miss
kathy
newman'
giles
ow
giles
look
in
my
bag
buffy
goes
and
picks
up
the
bag
look
in
the
bottom
pocket
of
my
bag
buffy
opens
the
pocket
she
has
parts
that
can
grow
after
they're
detached
buffy
takes
out
the
baggie
she
irons
her
jeans
she's
evil
she
has
to
be
destroyed
giles
holding
up
the
baggie
i
fear
the
demon
that
buffy
met
in
the
woods
has
somehow
possessed
her
lite
fm
love
songs
nothing
but
love
songs
xander
to
giles
you
think
um
you
stay
and
watch
her
ii
know
a
spell
that
will
make
the
possessing
demon
reveal
itself
so
that
we
can
fight
it
but
ii
need
to
get
some
supplies
from
the
magic
shop
buffy
i
see
you
around
he
leaves
taking
the
baggie
at
the
dorm
room
there's
an
insistent
knock
at
the
door
kathy
opens
it
to
reveal
willow

i
come
in
sure
kathy
lets
her
in
closing
the
door
where's
buffy
i
don't

i've
been
thinking
it
might
be
a
good
idea
for
you
and
buffy
to
give
each
other
some
apart
time
in
fact
you
might
want
to
be
uh
apart
before
she
gets
back
what
do
you
mean
i
should
leave
the
room
why
should
i
go
iit's
not
fair
i
know
you
bet
it's
not
fair
having
to
live
with
someone
who's
obviously
troubled
someone
who
so
clearly
needs
to
be
in
a
home
not
in
a
dorm
i
don't
know
about
that
uh
buffy's
going
through
something
yes
but
i
wouldn't
put
it
past
her
to
drop
out
or
take
off
or
something
do
something
horrible
to
herself
herself
or
worse
she's
capable
of
it
you
know
you
can
see
it
in
those
shifty
little
eyes
of
hers
one
of
these
days
she
might
even
push
somebody
too
far
the
phone
rings
and
kathy
answers
it
hello
kathy
holds
out
the
handset
it's
oz
willow
takes
it
hi
you
did
she's
at
giles
uh
ok
willow
hangs
up
and
starts
edging
back
toward
the
door
you
know
during
that
really
short
phone
call
i
realized
you
are
so
right
i
mean
it's
not
fair
to
make
you
leave
your
own
room
so
you're
good
you
just
stay
right
there
kay
willow
bolts
from
the
room
oz
and
xander
are
watching
buffy
in
giles'
apartment
i
can't
believe
this
after
all
that
we've
been
through
together
and
you
guys
won't
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
kathy
is
bad
we
want
to
buff
it's
just
shh
don't
engage
she
starts
struggling
against
the
ropes
i
don't
know
if
i
tightened
those
ropes
enough
then
we'd
better
go
over
there
and
check
'em
xander
laughs
until
he
sees
that
oz
was
serious
oh
dear
god
avoid
the
legs
xander
start
forward
avoid
the
legs
they
lean
over
her
and
she
brings
up
her
arms
grabs
them
and
knocks
their
heads
together
they
both
fall
to
the
floor
unconscious
she
tosses
the
rope
onto
xander's
body
nope
not
tight
enough
the
dorm
room
buffy
comes
through
the
door
and
closes
it
kathy
kathy's
lying
on
her
bed
reading
her
paperback
buffy
i
think
we
need
to
talk
don't
you
kathy
gets
up
and
walks
over
to
her
absolutely
let's
talk
buffy
kicks
up
a
corner
of
the
throw
rug
oops
look
what
i
did
kathy
backhands
buffy
across
the
face
huh
look
what
i
did
they
grab
each
others
heads
and
start
struggling
kathy's
human
face
comes
off
in
buffy's
hands
revealing
her
to
be
a
greeneyed
orange
skinned
demon
i
knew
it
kathy
rushes
her
throwing
her
back
scene
transitions

the
two
demons
in
the
woods
are
still
chanting
over
the
campfire
suddenly
the
ground
opens
up
with
a
spray
of
dirt
and
taparrich
emerges
he
is
much
taller
than
the
other
two
and
wears
a
different
style
of
robe
he
talks
in
subtitles
where
is
she
in
the
dorm
room
kathy
forces
buffy
down
straddling
her
with
a
hand
around
her
throat
quit
it
i
knew
it
i
knew
you
were
one
of
those
demon
things
oh
why
don't
you
just
stuff
it
and
let
me
finish
my
ritual
ritual
giles
in
the
magic
shop
in
what
looks
like
a
study
reading
from
an
old
book
'the
ritual
of
mok'tagar
a
race
of
transdimensional
demons
involves
the
forced
ingestion
of
animal
blood
while
the
victim
slumbers'
buffy's
nightmares
were
real
i'm
sorry
ok
i
left
my
dimension
to
go
to
college
and
they
sent
these
guys
after
me
'but
while
the
mok'tagar
can
assume
many
forms
and
guises
including
human
they
can
always
be
recognized
by
others
of
their
kind
due
to
the
lack
of
a
soul'
giles
looks
at
the
baggie
with
kathy's
toenail
clippings
so
i'm
borrowing
yours
buffy
in
a
'how
typical'
tone
without
even
asking
tonight
when
they
come
looking
for
me
they'll
take
the
one
without
a
soul
well
thank
god
i
won't
have
to
watch
you
floss
anymore
kathy
shouts
and
i
won't
have
to
live
with
a
slob
buffy
bites
the
hand
holding
her
down
kathy
lets
up
enough
for
buffy
to
get
leverage
and
throw
her
off
she
throws
kathy
against
the
bed
and
kicks
her
in
the
midsection
they
both
gain
their
feet
and
face
off
buffy
charges
and
kathy
throws
her
over
her
back
onto
the
bed
buffy
bounces
off
and
kicks
kathy
once
in
the
face
once
in
the
side
kathy
throws
a
punch
which
buffy
avoids
the
slayer
throws
a
punch
which
the
demon
blocks
kathy
grabs
buffy's
head
and
throws
her
across
the
room
and
through
buffy's
closet
door
kathy
singsong
it's
share
time
buffy
with
a
growl
she
runs
over

buffy's
feet
and
drags
her
out
of
the
closet
fine
let's
start
with
my
sweater

has
her
ketchupruined
sweater
in
her
hands
and
wraps
it
around
kathy's
neck
tightening
it
kathy
grabs
the
sweater
and
rips
it
in
two
oh
kathy
picks
her
up
and
throws
her
back
down
onto
the
floor
when
buffy
tries
to
get
up
again
she
gets
a
kick
in
the
face
at
giles'
apartment
xander
wakes
up
his

across
the
face

right
giles
gives
it
to
willow
kathy's
toenails
not
only
keep
growing
after
they've
been
cut
they
actually
regenerate
after
they've
been
destroyed
willow
examining
the
clippings
and
that's
a
demon
thing
oh

buffy
giles
xander
shows
him
the
rope

have
even
less
time
than
i
feared
giles
hurries
into
the
kitchen
and
starts
gathering
up
items
i've
looked
up
all
known
regenerating
demons
only
one
species
practices
the
ritual
buffy's
been
seeing
in
her
sleep
it's
used
to
steal
the
soul
from
a
human
body
wwait
are
you
saying
that
buffy's
been
doing
a
linda
blair
on

because
kathy's
been
sucking
her
soul
giles
sets
items
down
on
the
table
i
believe
so

excuse
me
please
he
drags
xander
off
the
chair
he'd
been
sitting
on
and
moves
it
out
of
the
way
so
buffy
was
right
all
along
later
on
big
remorse
giles
grabs
the
book
he'd
been
reading
earlier
now
i've
found
a
spell
that
should
reverse
the
soul
transfer
procedure
immediately
giles
hands
the
book
over
to
willow
willow
and
i
will
perform
it
at
once
leaving
xander
and
me
to
help
buffy
in
the
flesh
oz
rushes
out
xander
hesitates
a
moment
clearly
not
wanting
to
go
then
he
follows
giles
reads
from
the
book
held
by
willow
as
he
begins
lighting
candles
'hear
me
elders
of
the
upper
reaches
elders
of
the
lower
reaches
elders
of
the
dry
land
elders
of

in
the
dorm
room
kathy
throws
buffy
against
the
demon's
desk
pencils
fall
to
the
floor
ahhah
buffy
stomps
on
the
pencils
breaking
them
kathy
tries
a
backhand
which
buffy
blocks
buffy
grabs
her
head
swings
her
around
then
gives
her
an
uppercut
kathy
is
thrown
back
into
her
own
bookshelves
breaking
them
and
scattering
the
items
stored
there
she
rushes
at
buffy
and
throws
her
against
the
door
to
the
hall
in
the
hallway
on
the
outside
of
their
door
see
that
the
numbers
attached
to
it
read
two
fourteen
until
the
shock
of
buffy
hitting
the
door
causes
the
number
two
to
break
it's
upper
attachment
and
swing
around
upside
down
a
student
leans
out
of
his
room
just
next
door
do
you
mind
people
are
trying
to
study
kathy
runs
buffy
across
the
room
and
into
the
window
on
the
side
of
the
room
not
the
one
they
were
arguing
over
earlier
meaning
their
room
is
in
the
corner
of
the
building
it
breaks
leaving
buffy
lying
across
the
sill
kathy
grabs
her
giles'
apartment
'ancients
i
beseech
you
the
soul
abstracted
let
it
revert
to

room
kathy
drags
buffy
up
off
the
window
sill
the
window's
open
happy
she
throws
buffy
over
her
bed
and
the
slayer
ends
up
leaning
against
her
own
bed
kathy
jumps
on
her
and
tries
to
force
her
mouth
open
open
up
let
me
finish
kathy
gets
buffy's
mouth
open
giles'
apartment
'let
it
be
finished

the
unnatural
vessel
be
emptied
let
the
essence

returned

original
host'
dorm
room
kathy
tries
to
draw
out
the
rest
of
buffy's
soul
but
the
reverse
happens
as
buffy's
soul
material
is
returned
to
her
kathy
drops
spent
how
did
you
do
with
a
flash
of
light
what
looks
like
vortex
briefly
appears
to
be
followed
by
taparrich
who
materializes
inside
the
room
he
and
kathy
start
talking
in
subtitles
there
you
are
do
you
have
any
idea
how
much
trouble
you're
in
young
lady
i'm
not
going
back
don't
take
that
tone
with
me
i'm
3000
years
old
when
are
you
going
to
stop
treating
me
like
i'm
900
oz
and
xander
burst
through
the
door
and
taparrich
turns
on
them
with
a
roar
they
scoot
back
but
stay
in
the
room
the
demon
turns
back
to
kathy
enough
you're
coming
home
he
waves
his
arm
and
a
vortex
forms
in
the
floor
buffy
sees
it
and
quickly
crawls
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
bed
kathy
screams
as
she's
sucked
in
taparrich
steps
forward
and
enters
the
vortex
too
it
seals
leaving
the
floor
unblemished
buffy
oz
and
xander
stare
at
each
other
speechless
daytime
the
dorm
room
willow
is
moving
in
her
stuff
in
boxes
around
the
room
she's
hanging
up
a
'dingoes
ate
my
baby'
poster
buffy
has
just
finished
eating
half
of
a
sandwich
the
other
half
on
a
saucer
in
her
hand
how's
that
uhuh
a
little
to
the
left
there
perfect
i'm
so
glad
you're
here
will
buffy
sets
the
other
half
of
her
sandwich
on
the
dresser
i
can
already
feel
all
that
badkathykarma
just
draining
away
she
starts
moving
boxes
and
books
around
straightening
up
about
thatthe
kathy
thingi'm
sorry
i
doubted
you
willow
moves
things
from
a
box
into
one
of
the
drawers
in
the
dresser
you're
completely
forgiven
i
mean
you
had
reason
to
doubt
except
for
the
soul
sucking
thing
i
bet
kathy
was
pretty
regular
as
far
as
roomies
go
that's
a
pretty
big
'except'
i
guess
i'm
just
glad
that
it
was
kathy's
demony
ways
making
me
nofun
buffy
i've
always
thought
i
was
pretty
easy
goingyou
