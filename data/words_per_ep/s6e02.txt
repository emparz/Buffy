zoom
in
on
the

burning
half
burnt
away
buffy

littered
with
debris

wears
a
black
dress
with
dark
hose
and
black
heeled

mostly
covers

a
shot
from

is
blurry
and
indistinct
she
continues
walking
squinting

frowning
at
the
burning
cars

at
a

so

across

eases
into

with
a
pained
expression
tara
stands
behind
her
stroking
her
hair
where's
dawn
and
spike
we've
been
calling
the
house
but
xander
maybe
they're
on
their
way
here
i
mean
this
place
is
norad
and
we
are
at
defcon
one
the
women
all

at
him
in
confusion
okay

so

willow
tries
to

pushes
her
back
down
there's
this
guy
at
work
i
kind
of
hit
it
off
with
tito
i
mean
he
seems
like
a
good
once
again
they
all
give
him
a
look
xander
embarrassed
you
were
talking
about
dawn
and
spike
of
course
um
question
anya
to
willow
you
want
us
to
go
back
out
there
well
yeah
uh
unless
somebody's
got
a
better
idea
well
um
it's
just
we're
minus
a
buffybot
and
uh
spike
is
missing
in
action
somewhere
with
dawn
and
giles
flew
away
and
uh
well
you
you're
looking
a
little
magickedout
ahn
honey
we're
nearing
your
point
right
it's
just
how
are
we
supposed
to
fight
these
guys
anya
everyone
looks
at
her
i
mean
we
can
take
a
vampire
or
two
sure
but
there's
a
whole
cavalcade
of
demons
out
there

anya
uncertainly
i
mean
i
think
this
you
know
it
it
takes
um
i
mean
i
we
need
buffy
anya
softly
buffy
willow
harshly
buffy
they
nod
expectantly
is
not
coming
back
willow
sadly
we
failed
anya
looks
dismayed
the
others
look
sad
so
we're
it
gang
willow
gets
painfully
to
her
feet
xander
grab
the
weapons
we're
gonna
look
for
dawn
and
spike
sound
of
glass
breaking
they
all
turn
to
look
if
we're
gonna
go
we
should
go
now
they're
just
getting
more
and
more
worked
up
by
the
moment
well
they
can't
keep
it
up
forever
i
mean
maybe
they'll
party
themselves
out
you
know
tire
of
this
place
and
move
on
cut
to
razor
addressing
his
minions
say
hello
to
your
new
home
boys
the
demons
cheer
several
of
them
have
bottles
of
beer
one
of
them
takes
a
mouthful
of
beer
and
blows
it
at
his
torch
creating
a
huge
flame
we
see
that
they're
gathered
in
an
open
space
parking
lot
with
a
few
barrels
full
of
fire
a
burning
pile
of
trash
in
the
background
this
here
is
a
momentous
occasion
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
we
see
buffy
walking
slowly
toward
them
looking
around
now
no
question
the
open
backroads
and
highways
have
been
good
to
us
but
we've
got
ourselves
a
juicy
little
burg
here
just
ripe
for
the
picking
and
i
ain't
in
no
hurry
to
leave
it
you
the
demons
all
yell
no
as
buffy
walks
closer
we
see
them
from
her
point
of
view
about
a
hundred
feet
away
and
still
blurry
so
i
figure
what
better
way
to
kick
off
our
semisettlingdown
than
with
a
little
christening
the
demons
cheer
we
see
a
couple
of
demons
attaching
chains
to
their
motorcycles
they
grin
at
each
other
as
the
cheering
continues
buffy
walks
closer
a
symbolic
act
commemorating
the
new
order
around
here
and
ridding
ourselves
of
any
notsopleasant
reminders
of
the
old
razor
is
holding
a
gun
he
holds
it
up
and
theatrically
puts
a
bullet
in
all
in
one
quick
really
really
violent
fell
swoop
buffy
comes
right
up
behind
a
couple
of
the
demons
she
still
looks
very
muddled
they
don't
notice
her
razor
holds
up
the
gun
gentlemen
start
your
engines
the
demons
start
up
their
bikes
we
get
a
very
quick
look
at
the
bikes
with
chains
attached
and
the
buffybot
among
them
the
demons
sit
still
on
their
bikes
engines
rumbling
we
see
the
bot
standing
there
with
chains
attached
to
both
her
arms
the
real
buffy
catches
sight
of
the
bot
and
her
eyes
widen
in
shock
the
bot
sees
buffy
and
also
looks
surprised
byebye
slayer
buffy
takes
a
step
closer
we
see
the
bot's
mouth
say
buffy
but
we
can't
hear
her
over
the
engines
razor
fires
into
the
air
the
bikes
begin
to
move
buffy
screams
no
the
demons
nearest
buffy
hear
her
scream
and
turn
around
the
four
motorcycles
all
move
off
in
four
different
directions
each
bike
is
attached
to
one
of
the
bot's
limbs
her
arms
and
legs
are
ripped
from
her
body
and
her
torso
goes
flying
razor
grins
buffy
looks
around
anxiously
the
demons
near
her
move
aside
so
that
all
the
demons
can
see
her
razor
looking
at
buffy
another
one
for
the
fire
boys
buffy
looks
alarmed
tear
it
up
buffy
backs
away
turns
and
begins
to
run
blackout
act
iii

open
on
buffy
running
down
the
street
a
demon
on
a
motorcycle
comes
from
behind
and
cuts
in
front
of
her
cutting
her
off
she
turns
to
see
another
one
coming
at
her
swinging
a
chain
over
his
head
buffy
runs
toward
that
demon
as
the
first
one
follows
she
ducks
and
the
chain
hits
the
first
demon
knocking
him
off
his
bike
sorry
sorry
buffy
gets
up
and
runs
off
cut
to
xander
and
anya
walking
down
the
street
xander
has
an
axe
over
his
shoulder
pan
forward
to
reveal
tara
and
willow
walking
ahead
of
them
willow
carries
a
crossbow
it
wasn't
your
fault
we
we
don't
know
if
the
spell
would
have
worked
even
if
the
demons
hadn't
willow
it
would
have
worked
well
maybe
what
maybe
it
wasn't
supposed
to
i
mean
those
demons
showing
up
at
the
exact
wrong
time
maybe
we
really
were
in
over
our
heads
invoking
forces
that
we
have
no
right
to
maybe
the
fates
sent
down
all
that
destruction
on
us
to
stop
us
i
mean
you
mean
maybe
it
was
my
fault
no
no
they
put
their
arms
around
each
other
continue
walking
cut
to
buffy
leaping
over
a
pile
of
stuff
and
flinging
herself
over
a
fence
a
motorcycle
screeches
to
a
stop
behind
her
the
demon
growls
angrily
cut
back
to
the
scoobies
still
walking
anya
softly
to
xander
i'm
not
saying
we
announce
it
this
second
xander
whispers
anya
well
i
think
it
would
please
them
to
know
we're
engaged
and
i
think
willow
in
particular
could
use
a
real
moralebooster
right
now
can
we
talk
about
this
later
well
but
it's
just
all
the
excuses
for
not
telling
everyone
we're
engaged
are
gone
now
i
mean
aside
from
hell
bikers
there's
nothing
standing
in
our
way
this
is
it
no
more
surprises
suddenly
they
all
stop
walking
as
something
drops
to
the
ground
in
front
of
them
watch
it
it's
buffy
she
crouches
there
staring
at
them
through
her
hair
she
rises
to
her
feet
it
it's
the
buffy
bot
ah
peachy
no
doubt
to
lead
the
wild
bunch
right
to
us
again
hey
will
next
time
this
thing's
damaged
couldn't
ya
program
it
to
find
the
nearest
radio
shack
or
xander
breaks
off
when
he
sees
the
look
on
willow's
face
zoom
in
slowly
on
willow
staring
at
buffy
in
wonder
buffy
buffy
stares
fearfully
then
turns
and
runs
away
buffy
buffy
the
gang
runs
after
her
buffy
cut
to
the
scoobies
coming
around
a
corner
into
another
alley
where
is
she
willow
stops
we

crouched
in
a
corner
between
a
wall
and
some
random
junk
buffy
willow
moves
toward
her

toward
her

looks
up

all

in

buffy
xander
looks
at
willow
right
where
we
left
her
willow
and
tara
look
shocked
oh

in
her
coffin
willow
turns
in
anguish
to
tara

grave
buffy
continues
crouching
there
fearfully

away
letting
her
hair
cover
her
face
again
buffy
you
aren't
reaching
her
she's
too
traumatized
anya

xander
on
the
back
and
he
moves
aside
so
anya
can
take
his
place

look
alarmed
so
does
buffy
well
alive
anyway
shot
of
the
demons
from
buffy's
pov
razor
muffled
not
looking
too
good
though
is
she
xander
muffled
i
don't
see
you
winning
too
many
beauty
contests
cut
to
front
view
of
xander
with
the
axe
over
his
shoulder
unless
the

pageant

going
big
axe

there
the
better
to
cut
you
down
to
size
grandma
the
other
scoobies
look
nervous
razor
grins
takes
a
step
forward
incindere
a
gout
of
flame
spurts
up
from
the
ground
between
razor
and
xander
razor
steps
back
ah
so
you
got
a
witch
in
the
mix
more
than
one
i
happen
to
be
a
very
powerful
manwitch
myself
xander
razor
looks
amused
or
male
xander
over
his
shoulder
to
willow
is
it
a
warlock
willow
nods
xander
turns
back
to
razor
warlock
plus
we
have
a
slayer
here
uh
who
might
actually
be
looking
to
eat
some
brains
so
i
think
a
little
quiet
moseying
no
hard
feelings
and
i'm
sure
your
demon
horde
won't
think
any
the
less
of
you
razor
shakes
head
now
my
boys
see
that's
tricky
they
came
looking
for
a
massacre
we
see
buffy
looking
a
bit
more
aware
starting
to
rise
razor
buffy's
pov
muffled
and
i
think
you
got
exactly
enough
magic
between
you
for
a
kiddie
birthday
party
willow
steps
forward
then
you'd
be
wrong
whoa
well
i
better
back
off
or
you
might
what
pull
a
rabbit
out
of
a
hat
anya
horrified
don't
don't
do
that
anya
to
tara
why
would
she
do
that
anya
tara
shakes
her
head
we
don't
want
trouble
you
don't
want
trouble
of
course
we
want
trouble
we're
demons
we're
really
all
about
trouble
not
this
kind
oh
i
get
your
point
he
backhands
willow
who
flies
backward
and
lands
on
top
of
some
boxes
xander
charges
but
razor
shoves
him
aside
and
he
falls
to
the
ground
anya
and
tara
each
go
to
their
respective
partners
now
let
me
tell
you
something
children
we're
not
gonna
fight
you
we're
just
gonna
hold
you
down
and
enjoy
ourselves
for
a
few
hours
shot
of
tara
gently
turning
over
an
unconscious
willow
in
the
background
buffy
rises
to
her
feet
looking
at
willow
razor
os
you
might
even
live
through
it
razor
buffy
walks
forward
except
that
certain
of
my
boys
got
some
shot
of
razor
grinning
evilly
anatomical
incompatibilities
that
uh
tend
to
tear
up
little
girls
razor
grins
so
who
wants
to
go
first
buffy
comes
over
to
stand
directly
in
front
of
him
i
was
really
hoping
it'd
be
you
he
hits
her
in
the
face
her
head
whips
to
the
side
but
she
doesn't
otherwise
move
razor
looks
a
little
uncertain
slowly
she
turns
her
head
back
to
face
him
again
there's
blood
on
her
lip
her
face
hardens
into
her
famous
i'm
gonna
kick
your
ass
expression
razor
throws
another
punch
but
buffy
stops
it
grabbing
his
fist
and
holding
it
immobile
with
her
other
hand
she
punches
him
in
the
face
twice
then
she
kicks
him
he
falls
to
the
ground
unconscious
the
other
demons
look
on
nervously
willow
sits
up
stares
pan
across
razor's
inert
body
to
buffy
standing
over
it
looking
confused
xander
and
anya
stare
does
this
mean
we
win
the
other
demons
yell
and
attack
buffy
she
kicks
one
of
them
back
xander
and
anya
get
up
buffy
blocks
another
demon's
weapon
and
kicks
him
in
the
stomach
another
demon
attacks
xander
who
blocks
with
his
axe
then
punches
the
demon
buffy
blocks
a
punch
and
punches
the
demon
in
the
face
then
punches
another
one
willow
loads
her
crossbow
and
fires
hitting
a
demon
in
the
middle
of
the
chest
a
demon
attacks
buffy
with
a
knife
and
she
grabs
his
arm
in
both
hands
pauses
to
kick
another
demon
away
behind
her
swings
the
one
with
the
knife
around
and
throws
him
into
another
demon
shoves
another
one
away
ducks
and
punches
ducks
and
punches
again
then
buffy
is
surrounded
by
demons
hitting
her
with
various
weapons
and
she
huddles
down
on
the
ground
under
their
blows
suddenly
she
springs
back
up
again
throwing
them
off
her
she
kicks
one
in
the
groin
and
he
takes
two
more
down
with
him
another
demon
thrusts
a
baseball
bat
at
buffy
and
she
grabs
it
uses
one
end
to
hit
a
demon
behind
her
then
uses
the
other
end
to
hit
the
first
demon
cut
to
main
street
it's
deserted
but
littered
with
debris
some
of
which
is
on
fire
a
motorcycle
comes
roaring
down
the
street
cut
closer
and
we
see
that
it's
spike
and
dawn
dawn
sees
something
up
ahead
there
what's
that
spike
looks
turns
toward
it
they
pass
a
flaming
barrel
then
drive
into
the
open
space
where
the
demons
were
partying
it's
deserted
now
too
spike
brings
the
bike
to
a
stop
next
to
the
pile
of
flaming
rubble
they
both
dismount
staring
at
something
on
the
ground
dawn
takes
the
helmet
off
and
tosses
it
aside
as
they
move
forward
shot
of
buffybot's
torso

kick
the
demon

xander
leaps
to
his

and
slams
his
axe
down
into
the
demon
buffy
turns
from
fighting
one
demon
with
the
baseball
bat
and
another
one
flings
a
length
of
chain
which
wraps
around
the
bat
the
demon
uses
it
to
pull
the
bat
out
of
buffy's
hand
then
he
attacks
her
with
a
knife
she
blocks
grabs
the
knifewielding
arm
and
uses
it
to
stab
another
demon
as
he
charges

kicks
out

kicking
away
another
demon
and
as
for
the

she's
holding

a
quick
step

looking
fearful

buffy
looks
around
in
anguish
she
lifts
her
bloody
hand
to
her
mouth
wipes
the
blood
from
her
lip
looks
at
her
hand
she
looks
about
to
cry
she
walks
forward
the
others
watch
uncertainly
buffy
goes
past
xander
and
breaks
into
a
run
taking
off
around
the
corner
buffy
the
scoobies
watch

suddenly
his

is
that

claws
shoot
out
of
his

shoves
xander
to
the
ground
as

attacks
the
blow

hits
the

buttfirst
the

watch
fearfully
as
razor
advances
on
xander
who
scrambles
backward
on
his
butt
now
what
kind
of
slayer
is
it
runs
out
on
her
buddies
just
when

need
her
the
most
xander
grabs
a
trashcan
lid
and
holds
it
up
as
a
shield
as
razor
attacks
again
the
metal
claws
slice
right
through
the
shield
xander
looks
scared
cut
to

she
ducks
and
hits
him

wall
where
another
piece
of
metal
impales
him

falls
dead
buffy
stares
at
him

looks
up

see
the
tower
that
glory's
minions
built
buffy
runs
off
cut
back

with
sticks
tara
with
a
piece
of
chain
he
covers
his
head
with
his
hands
as
they
beat
on
him
then
razor
does
the
same
move
that
buffy
did
earlier
straightening
up
and
flinging
them
off
of
him
they
all
fall
back
willow
holds
up
her
hand
obfuscate
a
gray
ball
appears
in
her
hand
and
she
throws
it
at
razor
it
covers
his
face
with
some
kind
of
goo
so
he
can't
see
he
roars
and
pulls
at
it
with
his
hands
cut
to
dawn
running
around
a
corner
hearing
razor
yell
in
the
background
she
sees
the

around

looks
up
and
sees
the

hand
and
shoots
over
to
