file

bench

buffy
shakes
her
head
at
him

the
first

first
evil
the
power
that
tried
to

a
little
more
ambitious
since
then
it's
raising
an
army

failed
once
and
i'm
here
to
tell
you—
caleb
stands
up
behind
angel
and
knocks
angel
down
by
hitting
him
with
a
cat
statue
sending
him
across
the
floor
caleb
walks
up
to
buffy
black
blood
streaming
from
his
eyes
and
nose

just
confronted

in
the
tomb
after
having
knocked
angel
out
caleb
swings
the
cat
statue
at
buffy
but
she
blocks
with
the
scythe
and
then

to
the
ground

swings
at
him
with
the
scythe
but
he
blocks
with

scythe
buffy
breathing
hard
okhow

times
do
i
have
to
kill
you
ballpark
figure
you
understand
nothing
buffy
swings
at
caleb
but
he
grabs
the
scythe
holding
it
still
and
punches
buffy
in
the
face
twice
he
lifts
buffy
in
the
air
pressing
her
back
against
the
low
ceiling
buffy
struggles
and
caleb
finally
lets
her
fall
to
the
floor
he
walks
up
to
her
slowly
then
picks
her
up
by
her
lapels
caleb
through
gritted
teeth
you
think
you
have
power
over
me
buffy
breaks
free
of
his
grip
and
kicks
him
knocking
him
down
to
the
floor
stupid
girl
caleb
stands
you'll
never
stop
me
you
don't
have
the
ba—
while
caleb
gets
to
his
feet
buffy
twirls
the
scythe
and
swings
it
up
between
his
legs
caleb's
eyes
go
wide
who
does
nowadays
caleb
looks
down
incredulously
at
the
scythe
lodged
in
his
body
between
his
legs
buffy
swiftly
pushes
the
scythe
up
through
his
body
angel
lying
on
the
floor
regains
consciousness
and
stands
angrily
ok
now
i'm
pissed
where
is
he
buffy
looks
to
her
right
then
to
her
left
then
at
angel
he
had
to
split
buffy
giggles
devilishly
first
buffy
whispering
to
spike
who's
still
watching
buffy
from
the
shadows
yeah
she
needs
you
real
bad
angel
picks
up
the
folder
again
and
brings
it
to
buffy
i'll
have
the
guys
go
through
that
see
if
there's
anything
new
reliable
source
not
remotely
mm
any
port
in
an
apocalypse
i
uh
brought
something
else
as
well
angel
takes
an
amulet
out
of
his
pocket
and
holds
it
up
for
buffy
to
see
it's
a
2inch
diameter
round
crystal
pendant
in
a
silver
starburst
setting
hung
from
a
coarse
silver
chain
buffy
shakes
her
head
i
can
already
tell
you
i
have
nothing
that
goes
with
that
it's
not
for
you
splainy
i
don't
know
everything
it's
very
powerful
and
probably
very
dangerous
it
has
a
purifying
power
a
cleansing
power
possibly
scrubbing
bubbles
the
translation
is
uh—anyway
it
bestows
strength
to
the
right
person
who
wears
it
and
the
right
person
is
someone
ensouled
but
stronger
than
human
a
champion
as
in
me
or
me
no
i
don't
know
nearly
enough
about
this
to
risk
you
wearing
it
besides
you
got
that
real
cool
axething
going
for
you
spike
walks
out
the
back
without
being
noticed
so
you're
gonna
be
with
me
in
this
shoulder
to
shoulder
i'm
yours
no
no
what
no
you're
not
gonna
be
in
this
fight
buffy
walks
away
angel
cuts
her
off
why
the
hell
not
'cause
i
can't
risk
you
you
need
me
in
this
no
i
need
you
gone
why
if
i
lose
if
this
thing
gets
past
sunnydale
then
it's
days—maybe
hours—before
the
rest
of
the
world
goes
i
need
a
second
front
and
i
need
you
to
run
it
ok
angel
crosses
his
arms
that's
one
reason
what's
the
other
buffy
walks
out
of
the
tomb
there
is
no
other
cut

angel
follows
her
is
it
spike
angel
buffy
stops
walking
turns
to
face
angel
you're
not
telling
me
something
and
his
scent
i
remember
it
pretty
well
you
vampires
did
anybody
ever
tell
you
the
whole
smelling
people
thing's
a
little
gross
buffy
walks
away
angel
follows
is
he
your
boyfriend
is
that
your
business
you
in
love
with
him
ok
maybe
i'm
outta
line
but
this
is
kind
of
a
curve
ball
for
me
i
mean
we
are
talking
about
spike
here
it's
different
he's
different
he
has
a
soul
now
angel
stops
oh
angel
looks
up
well
what
that's
great
angel
mumbling
to
himself
everyone's
got
a
soul
now
he'll
make
a
difference
angel
mumbling
you
know
i
started
it
the
whole
having
a
soul
before
it
was
all
the
cool
new
thing
oh
my
god
are
you
12
i'm
getting
the
brush
off
for
captain
peroxide
it
doesn't
necessarily
bring
out
the
champion
in
me
you're
not
getting
the
brush
off
are
you
just
gonna
come
here
and
go
all
dawson
on
me
every
time
i
have
a
boyfriend
aha
angel
points
boyfriend
he's
not
buthe
is
in
my
heart
that'll
end
well
angel
walks
away
leans
on
a
tombstone
what
was
the
highlight
of
our
relationship
when
you
broke
up
with
me
or
when
i
killed
you
i'm
well
aware
of
my
stellar
history
with
guys
buffy
sighs
leans
beside
angel
and
no
i
don't
see
fat
grandchildren
in
the
offing
with
spike
but
i
don't
think
that
really
matters
right
now
buffy
chuckles
you
know
in
the
midst
of
all
this
insanity
a
couple
things
are
actually
starting
to
make
sense
and
the
guy
thing—
buffy
sighs
i
always
feared
there
was
something
wrong
with
me
you
know
because
i
couldn't
make
it
work
but
maybe
i'm
not
supposed
to
because
you're
the
slayer
buffy
looks
at
angel
because—ok
i'm
cookie
dough
i'm
not
done
baking
i'm
not
finished
becoming
whoever
the
hell
it
is
i'm
gonna
turn
out
to
be
i
make
it
through
this
and
the
next
thing
and
the
next
thing
and
maybe
one
day
i
turn
around
and
realize
i'm
ready
i'm
cookies
and
then
you
know
if
i
want
someone
to
eat—
buffy
eyes
go
wide
as
she
catches
herself
or
enjoy
warm
delicious
cookie
me
thenthat's
fine
that'll
be
then
when
i'm
done
any
thoughts
on
who
might
enjoy—
angel
sighs
irritated
do
i
have
to
go
with
the
cookie
analogy
i'm
not
really
thinking
that
far
ahead
that's
kind
of
the
point
angel
hands
the
amulet
to
buffy
i'll
go
start
working
on
the
second
front
make
sure
i
don't
have
to
use
it
angel
walks
away
buffy
calls
after
him
angel
buffy
he
turns
to
look
at
her
i
do
sometimes
think
that
far
ahead
sometimes
is
something
angel
smiles
walks
away
be
a
long
time
coming
years
if
ever
angel
shrugs
i
ain't
getting
any
older

buffy

in

punching

when
buffy
walks
down
the
stairs
sowhere's
tall
dark
and
forehead
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
let
me
guess
you
can
smell
him
yeah
that
and
i
also
used
my
enhanced
vampire
eyeballs
to
watch
you
kissing
him
buffy
awkwardly
it
wasa
hello
most
people
don't
use
their
tongues
to
say
hello
or
i
guess
they
do
but—
there
were
no
tongues
besides
he's
gone
oh
just
popped
by
for
a
quickie
then
buffy
walks
away
good
good
i
haven't
had
quite
enough
jealous
vampire
crap
for
one
night
he
wears
lifts
you
know
buffy
looks
over
at
the
punching
bag
that
spike
was
hitting
and
sees
something
has
been
taped
to
it
a
sketch
drawn
in
black
marker
on
white
paper
shows
hair
that
sticks
straight
up
x's
for
eyes
and
fangs
on
the
frowny
face
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
at
the
representation
of
angel
you
know
one
of
these
days
i'm
just
gonna
put
you
2
in
a
room
and
let
you
wrestle
it
out
spike
rifling
through
an
empty
cigarette
package
no
problem
at
this
end
spike
throws
the
package
away
in
disgust
buffy
her
eyes
widen
with
excitement
there
could
be
oil
of
some
kind
involved
spike
walks
up
to
buffy
where's
the
trinket
the
whoket
the
pretty
necklace
your
sweetiebear
gave
you
the
one
with
all
the
power
i
believe
it's
mine
now
how
do
you
figure
someone
with
a
soul
but
more
than
human
angel
meant
to
wear
it
that
means
i'm
the
qualified
party
spike
holds
out
his
hands
it's
volatile
we
don't
know—
you'll
be
needing
someone
strong
to
bear
it
then
you
planning
on
giving
it
to
andrew
buffy
looks
at
the
amulet
then
at
spike
angel
said
the
amulet
was
meant
to
be
worn
by
a
champion
spike
looks
down
disappointed
but
buffy
walks
forward
and
hands
it
to
him
been
called
a
lot
of
things
in
my
time
buffy
coyly
faith
still
has
my
room
well
you're
not
staying
here
you
can't
buy
me
off
with
shiny
beads
and
sweet
talk
you
got
angel
breath
i'm
not
gonna
just
let
you
whack
me
back
and
forth
like
a
rubber
ball
i've
got
my
pride
you
know
i
understand
buffy
turns
to
walk
away
spike
cuts
her
off
clearly
you
don't
'cause
the
whole
having
my
pride
thing
was
just
a
smokescreen
buffy
sighs
with
relief
oh
thank
god
i
don't
know
what
i
would
have
done
if
you'd
have
gone
up
those
stairs
later
buffy
and
spike
are
lying
together
on
the
cot
fully
clothed
spike
has
his
arm
around
buffy
and
she
fondles
his
hand
he
rolls
over
removing
his
arm
from
her
and
she
sits
up
she
stands
and
paces
around
the
basement
she
is
looking
out
the
window
staring
at
the
night
sky
when
first
caleb
appears
pretty
ain't
it
you're
not
him
no
you
killed
him
right
and
proper
terrible
loss
this
man
was
my
good
right
arm
'course
it
don't
pain
me
too
much
don't
need
an
arm
got
an
army
an
army
of
vampires
however
will
i
fight—
every
day
our
numbers
swell
but
then
you
do
have
an
army
of
your
own
some
thirtyodd
pimplyfaced
girls
don't
know
the
pointy
end
of
a
stake
first
caleb
feigns
concern
maybe
i
should
call
this
off
have
you
ever
considered
a
cool
name
i
mean
since
you're
incorporeal
and
basically
powerless
how
about
the
taunter
strikes
fear
in
the
heart—
i
will
overrun
this
earth
and
when
my
army
outnumbers
the
humans
on
this
earth
the
scales
will
tip
and
i
will
be
made
flesh
talk
on
i'm
not
afraid
of
you
first
caleb
rolls
eyes
then
why
aren't
you
asleep
in
your
dead
lover's
arms
first
caleb
looks
over
at
spike
'cause
he
can't
help
you
nor
faith
nor
your
friends
certainly
not
your
wannaslay
brigade
none
of
those
girlies
will
ever
know
real
power
unless
you're
dead
you
know
the
drill

caleb
morphs
into
buffy's
form
into
every
generation
a
slayer
is
born
one
girl
in
all
the
world
she
alone
will
have
the
strength
and
skill
to—
there's
that
word
again
what
you
are
how
you'll
die
alone
where's
your
snappy
comeback
you're
right
hmm
not
your
best
spike

room
full
of
potentials
and
her
friends
i
hate
this
i
hate
being
here
i
hate
that
you
have
to
be
here
i
hate
that
there's
evil
and
that
i
was
chosen
to
fight
it
i
wish
a
whole
lot
of
the
time
that
i
hadn't
been
i
know
a
lot
of
you
wish
i
hadn't
been
either
buffy
kennedy
and
rona
look
away
but
this
isn't
about
wishes
this
is
about
choices
i
believe
we
can
beat
this
evil
not
when
it
comes
not
when
its
army
is
ready
now
tomorrow
morning
i'm
opening
the
seal
i'm
going
down
into
the
hellmouth
and
i'm
finishing
this
once
and
for
all
right
now
you're
asking
yourself
what
makes
this
different
what
makes
us
anything
more
than
a
bunch
of
girls
being
picked
off
one
by
one
it's
true
none
of
you
have
the
power
that
faith
and
i
do
so
here's
the
part
where
you
make
a
choice
cut
to
14
int
basement
at
sunnydale
high
day
faith
and
robin
wood
are
moving
furniture
around
it's
one
hell
of
a
risky
idea
buffy's
wacky
that
way
yeah
there's
one
more
vent
right
by
the
stairs
we
block
that
they
got
no
sewer
access
should
drive
them
straight
up
into
the
school
proper
that's
assuming
they
get
past
us
which
no
offense
i
am
come
on
you
gotta
have
a
little
faith
robin
under
his
breath
i
think
i've
had
my
share
thanks
well
i
trundled
right
into
that
one
didn't
i
look
i'm
sorry
if
it
seemed
like
i
was
blowing
you
off
the
other
day
i
was
just
trying
to
you
know
blow
you
off
yeah
you
know
what
i
figured
that
one
out
all
by
myself
it's
nothing
personal
it's
just
after
i
get
bouncy
with
a
guy
there's
not
that
much
more
i
need
to
know
about
him
that's
bleak
way
of
the
world
that's
good
to
know
'cause
for
a
second
there
i
thought
it
was
more
defensive
isolationist
slayer
crap
faith
laughs
and
he
comes
out
swinging
faith
there's
a
whole
world
out
there
that
you
don't
even
know
about
and
a
lot
of
the
men
in
it
are
pretty
decent
guys
they'd
surprise
you
faith
shrugs
guy
looks
at
me
let's
just
say
his
priorities
shift
why
because
you're
so
hot
it's
what
it
is
yo
oh
please
i
am
so
much
prettier
than
you
are
robin
faith
seems
taken
aback
oh
and
uh
for
the
record
our
little
encounter
didn't
exactly
change
my
world
you're
tripping
that
was
rock
'em
sock
'em
no
no
no
no
it
was—it
was—it
was
nice
enough
you
know
and
you're—you're
very
um
mm
enthused
and
i
think
with
a
little
more
experience—
dude
i
got
mad
skills
yeah
of
course
let's
finish
up
no
hell
with
that
we're
going
again
baby
faith
starts
unbuckling
her
belt
you're
gonna
learn
a
little
respect
here
pal
faith—
robin
chuckles
make
me
a
deal
all
right
we
live
through
this
you
give
me
the
chance
to
surprise
you
what
would
be
the
surprise
robin
looks
at
her
you
do
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
right
fine
faith
rebuckles
her
belt
deal
good
enough
no
way
you're
prettier
than
me

little
bit
