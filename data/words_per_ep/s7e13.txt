right
giles
looks

nervously
stops
oh

vi's

you
mind
running

car
dawn
stands
goes
to
the

sure
while
you're
at

you
smack
her
in
the

with
it
and
remind

lying
around
dawn

takes
of
glasses
wipes
his
brow
in
such
a
state
of
flux
i
know
but
you
should
go
this
trip
is
important
for
the
girls
to
understand
the
source
of
their
power
and
to
know
how
to
use
it
right
do
you
think
they
appreciate
the
gravity
of
what
we're
undertaking
it's
frightening
and
it's
difficult
and
then
apparently
someone
told
them
that
the
vision
quest
consists
of
me
driving
them
to
the
desert
doing
the
hokey
pokey
until
a
spooky
rastamama
slayer
arrives
and
speaks
to
them
in
riddles
giles
looks
at
buffy
buffy
looks
innocent
that's
not
exactly
how
i
put
it
i—
buffy

day
buffy
walks
downstairs
to
the
basement
toward
where
spike
is
sitting
on
a
cot
his
wrists
chained
to
the
wall
hey
hey
giles
is
off
on
the
retreat
give
us
all
a
chance
for
a
breather
eh
from
giles
from
the
constant
pitter
patter
of
clomping
teenage
girly
feet
buffy
shrugs
i
have
no
idea
what
you're
talking
about
come
on
no
i
enjoy
my
responsibility
as
mentor
role
model
life
guide—oh
my
god
i
cannot
believe
i
have
my
bathroom
all
to
myself
for
two
whole
days
buffy
sits
on
the
cot
beside
spike
spike
leans
forward
it's
like
a
bloody
warzone
up
there
and
not
in
a
good
way
have
you
seen
the
kitchen
since
they've
been
here
i'm
just
trying
to
stay
out
of
their
way
buffy
glances
at
his
chains
i
noticed
spike
looks
at
his
chains
this
is
better
believe
me
it's
safer
ok
but
you've
been
fine
in
close
contact
with
the
girls
spike
looks
at
buffy
with
you
by
my
side
yeah
you
won't
let
me
hurt
one
of
them
and
that's
the
way
it's
gonna
be
until
we're
sure
the
first
is
done
making
me
its
bitch
either
we're
together
or
i'm
on
the
leash
we
just
need
to
make
sure
the
trigger's
deactivated
then
we've
got
a
couple
of
days
lack
of
pitterpatter
and
all
spike
leans
forward
looking
at
her
earnestly
buffy
what
ow
ow
spike
his
face
contorts
twitching
ow
ow
ow
spike
leans
back
thrashes
against
the
wall
what's
wrong
buffy
spike
puts
his
hands
to
his
head
spike
what
is
going
on
spike
calmer
now
the
chip
god
why
would—
spike
screams
aaahhh
spike
holds
his
hands
to
his
head
writhing
in
intense
pain
opening

i

cut
to
13
int
kitchen
at
buffy's
house
night
a
tea
kettle
whistles
as
buffy
walks
into
the
kitchen
from
the
basement
willow's
at
the
stove
hey
how
is
he
buffy
sits
oh
in
the
goes
part
of
comes
and
goes
well
there
seems
to
be
a
definite
lack
of
screaming
that
has
to
be
good
you'd
think
buffy
willow
pours
hot
water
into
a
cup
that
for
the
other
patient
yeah
thought
i'd
bring
her
some
tea
help
her
feel
better
buffy
smiling
teasingly
mmhmm
it's
just
tea
buffy
giggles
then
pauses
will
how
much
do
you
know
about
the
chip
spike's
chip
well
i
remember
trying
to
dig
up
stuff
back
then
but
you
know
turns
out
when
a
secret
government
agency
studies
vampires
and
puts
chips
in
their
brains
that
keep
them
from
hurting
people
they
don't
really
build
websites
why
even
with
the
chip
spike
was
able
to
hurt
all
those
people
when
he
was
brainwashed
yeah
but
he
was
under
the
control
of
the
first
maybe
something's
wrong
with
it
the
chip
is
misfiring
all
on
its
own
then
well
this'll
be
fun
remember
when
things
used
to
be
nice
and
boring
willow
shrugs
no
willow
walks
out
of
the
kitchen
with
tea
in
hand
buffy
teasingly
calls
after
her
have
fundelivering
tea
willow
stops
turns
around

when
you
make
it
sound

heads
upstairs

willow
walks
into
her
room
to
find
kennedy
putting
on
her
shoes
hey
i
figured
the
best
thing
for
a
cold
is
a
nice
hot
cup
of
willow
frowns
boots
hey
for
someone
who's
sick
you
look
surprisingly
robust
and
casual
dressy
well

it's
just—
willow
shocked
you
were
never
sick
noi
was
never
sick
oh
you
are
so
busted
xander's
gonna
have
to
drive
you
to
the
desert

willow

a
reason
i

a
thing
a
separate

kennedy
puts
on
her
coat
something's

and
paper
umbrella
garnishes
sitting
at

of
the
tables
listening
to
the

face
her
sighing
you're
sexy
when
you
pout
why
do
you
do
that
kennedy
pouts
to
get
you
to
stay
willow
returns
to
the
table
sits
all
right
i'll
stay
for
one
drink
then
i'm
going
home
ok
one
drink
i
can
work
with
that
let's
start
with
the
easy
stuff
how
long
have
you
known
that
you're
gay
wait
that's
easy
willow
fidgets
and
you
just
assume
that
i'm—i'm
gay
i
mean
presume
much
kennedy
grins
ok
how
long
have
you
enjoyed
having
sex
with
women
willow
taken
aback
hey
willow
kennedy
chuckles
what
you
think
you
have
some
special
lesbidar
or
something
ok
you
know
there's
a
better
word
for
that
right
kennedy
willow
sips
her
drink
you
really
haven't
been
getting
out
there
much
have
you
well
i
just—can
you
always
tell
just—just
by
looking
at
someone
no
no
of
course
not
that
wouldn't
be
any
fun
the
fun
part
is
the
process
of—of
getting
to
know
a
girl
it's
like—it's
like
flirting
in
code
it's
using
body
language
and
laughing
at
the
right
jokes
and—and
looking
into
her
eyes
and
knowing
she's
still
whispering
to
you
even
when
she's
not
saying
a
word
and
that
sense
that
if
you
can
just
touch
her
just
once
everything
will
be
ok
for
both
of
you
that's
how
you
can
tell
kennedy
sits
back
grins
or
if
she's
really
hot
you
just
get
her
drunk—see
if
she
comes
on
to
you
three
years
ago
that's
when
i
knew
and
it
wasn't
women
it
was
woman

lucky

spike
buffy

him
a
towel
he
wipes
blood
from
his
nose
there's
gotta
be
a
reason
why
the
chip
is
going
all
wonky
maybe
it's
related
to
the
trigger
or
maybe
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
new
soul
or
maybe
i
wasn't
meant
to
last
this

other
stories
from

non
yellow
crayon
stories
in
which
you
don't
come
out
in
such
a
good
light
an
incident

aquaman
underoos
for
example
you
want
me
to
start
talking
xander
smiles
walks
up
to
willowwarren
hey
willow
what
happened
everyone
inches
closer
to
willowwarren
i
don't
know
we
were
there
and
then
i
looked
like
him
oh
like
a
glamour
maybe
but
i
probably
brought
it
on
myself
what
makes
you
think
that
well
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
i
have
a
history
with
my
witchy
subconscious
making
things
go
kerfloopey
remember
the
wacky
i
can't
see
you
you
can't
see
me
spell
while
willowwarren's
talking
dawn
touches
his
shoulder
andrew
touches
his
chest
and
face
buffy
to
dawn
and
andrew
guys
andrew
stops
touching
willowwarren
it's
so
real
i'm
all
too
aware
willow
warren
brushes
dawn's
hand
away
ok
say
you're
right
and
you
did
do
this
to
yourself
why
would
your
subconscious
turn
you
into
warren
obviously
because
i
feel
bad—about
killing
him
we'll
deal
we'll
get
help
no
i
can
handle
this
on
your
own
why
i
did
it
i'll
fix
it
i
don't
want
you
seeing
me
this
way
anyway
willow
warren
walks
toward
the
door
it's
kinda
a
little
late
for
that
buffy
spike's
moaning
in
the
background
seriously
i'm
not
posing
any
big
threat
to
the
world
looks
like
you've
got
your
hands
full
already
buffy
looks
around
sees
spike
lying
on
the
floor
moaning
and
twitching
i'll
go
i'll
handle
it
i'll
fix
it
i'll
be
back

you
even
know
i'm
gone
promise

dawn
and
andrew
gather
around
to
watch
buffy
and
spike
kennedy
sneaks

kennedy
walks
up

her
surprising
her

willow
warren
walks
away
kennedy
follows
come
on
i
mean
you
turned
into
a
guy
i
mean
if
you
take
a
step
back
seriously
there's
a
certain
element
of
humor
here
right
kennedy
willowwarren
stops
walking
turns
and
glares
at
her
well
a
really
really
big
step
i
killed
him
it's
hard
to
see
the
chuckles
willow
warren
walks
away
kennedy
follows
so
you
got
a
plan
yeah
get
some
help
reversing
it
i
thought
you
were
gonna
try
it
yourself
i
did
try
something's
blocking
me
all
the
more
reason
for
me
to
go
with
you
plus
i
was
there
when
it
happened
lemme
come
to
try
to
help
too
willow
warren
stops
walking
i
really
think
i'm
fine
with
the
handling
by
yourself
why
i'm
the
one
that
killed
him
i—
it's
hard
to
understand
given
how
'bout
i
just
tag
along
anyway
keep
you
company
kennedy
willowwarren
sighs
i'm
taking
that
as
a
yes

you

the
chip'd
kick

feel

explode
they'd
dope
me
up

everything

be
all
daffodils
and
teddy
bears
for

can
about

i'll
take
whatever
i

night
anya
and
dawn
are
sitting
on
the
couch
xander's
sitting
in
a
cushy
chair
propping
his
feet
up
on
the
coffee
table
andrew's
sitting
on
the
floor
between
xander
and
the
fireplace
the
phone
rings
i'll
get
it
andrew
stands
i'm
supposed
to
get
a
call
when
the
new
league
of
extraordinary
gentlemen
comes
in
i
gave
them
this
number
ooh
can
you
see
if
you
can
get
two
summers
residence
this
is
andrew
speaking
how
can
i
help
you
xander
realizes
that
dawn
and
anya
are
staring
at
him
looks
at
andrew
loser
andrew
holds
his
hand
over
the
phone
hey
do
we
know
some
british
guy
named
robson
time
passes
xander
hangs
up
the
phone
and
reports
to
dawn
and
anya
he
was
attacked
this
robson
guy
in
england
xander
sits
and
giles
was
there
helping
him
and
there
was
a
bringer
anya
leans
forward
xander
robson
blacked
out
but
the
last
thing
he
remembers
is
giles's
head
about
to
get
really
familiar
with
a
bringer's
very
sharp
axe
oh
my
god
giles
never
mentioned
any
of
this
robson
said
by
the
time
he
came
to
there
was
no
giles
so
what
are
we
saying
maybe
giles
just
didn't
want
to
talk
about
it
or
maybe
he
didn't
make
it
look
i'm
not
saying
it's
a
happy
scenario
but
we're
dealing
with
a
big
bad
that
can
be
any
dead
person
it
wants
because
if
you
want
to
infiltrate
the
inner
circle
of
the
slayer
become
the
one
person
she
trusts
more
than
anybody
else
but
there's
no
way
that
we
can
know
actually
that's
not
true
the
first
can't
take
corporeal
form
so
it
can't
touch
anything
oh
it's
not
like
giles
hasn't
touched
anything
right
anya
thinks
looks
expectantly
at
everyone
else
hahas
anyone
seen
giles
touch
anything
since
he
got
back
hold
anything
has
anybody
hugged
him

very
hard
xander

let
me
just
get
some
tapes
for
the
car
i've
been
working
on
this
mix—
you're
not
coming
what
why
'cause
i
used
to
be
evil
no
actually
'cause
you're
annoying

reason

angrily
tell

why
you
did

leans
forward
menacingly
but
amy
waves
her
hands
causing

to
be

thrust
across

lands

what
did
you
do

what

just
your

is

and
that's

crazy
talk
for
what

i
put
a

on

i
got
that
part
but
why
warren
and
why
did
it
happen
after
we
kissed
oh
amy
chuckles
that's
rich
amy
slinks
closer
to
kennedy
that
must've
been
some
kiss
you
must
be
good
answer
me
the
hex
i
cast
lets
the
victim's
subconscious
pick
the
form
of
their
punishment
it's
always
better
than
anything
i
can
come
up

elegant
you

kennedy
threateningly
undo
it
let
her
out
ok
oh
wait
i
forgot—no
why
would
you
do
this
to
her
you
really
hate
her
that
much
amy
sighs
this
is
not
about
hate
it's
about
power
willow
always
had
all
the
power
long
before
she
even
knew
what
to
do
with
it
just
came
so
easy
for
her
the
rest
of
us—we
had
to
work
twice
as
hard
to
be
half
as
good
but
no
one
cares
about
how
hard
you
work
they
just
care
about
cute
sweet
willow
they
don't
know
how
weak
she
is
she
gave
in
to
evil—stuff
worse
than
i
can
even
imagine—
she
almost
destroyed
the
world
and
yet
everyone
keeps
on
loving
her
amy

face
so
what's
wrong
with
having

fun

her

fun

she's
disappearing

you

it's
fun
it
was
just
a
game
it's
not
my
fault
if
she's
losing
herself
i'm
gonna
stop
you
now
you
know
amy

hey
i'm
not
the
bad

is
done
