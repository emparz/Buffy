well
aand
you

sit
on
the
sofa
i'm
just
starting
to
feel
uneasy
about
stuff
stuff
training
slaying
all
of
it
it's
just
i
mean
i
can
beat
up
the
demons
until
the
cows

then
i
can
beat
up
the
cows
but
i'm
not

doing
to
me
but
you've
mastered
so
much
i
mean
your
strength
and
resilience
alone
buffy
yeah
strength
resilience
those
are
all
words
for
hardness
giles
pause
i'm
starting
to
feel
like
being
the
slayer
is
turning
me
into
stone
turning
you
into
stone
buffy
buffy
just
think
about
it
giles
gets
up
paces
i
was

was
for
angel

was
terrible
to

at
a
time
like
this
buffy
no
you're
bound
to
feel
emotionally
numb
before
that
riley
left
because
i
was
shut
down

my
mom
is
gone

giles
gets
up
puts
his
hand
on
buffy's
shoulder
always
i
don't
know
to
slay
to
kill
iit
means
being
hard
on
the
inside
maybe
being
the
perfect
slayer
means
being
too
hard
to
love
at
all
i
already
feel
like
i
can
hardly
say
the
words
buffy
giles
i
love

cut
to
a
slice
of
desert
there
are
sandy
dunes
with
some
scraggly
bushes
and
one
tree
heat
waves
shimmer
in
the
air
giles'
convertible
comes
around
the
dune

up
and
stops
giles
and
buffy
get
out
giles
goes
to
open
the
trunk
buffy
follows
she
wears
a
long
brown
coat
over
brown
pants
and
a
brown
turtleneck
giles
wears
jeans
a
black
shirt
and
a
brown
suede
jacket
what's
in
the
trunk
supplies
giles
leans
into
the
trunk
supplies
i
was
wondering
about
that
like
food
water
maybe
a
compass
giles
straightens
up
holding
stuff
what
about
a
book
a
gourd
and
a
bunch
of
twigs
i
don't
think
i'll
be
that
hungry
they're
for
me
come
on
this
way
he
walks
off
with
buffy
following
cut
to
them
walking
across
the
sand
you
see
the
location
of
the
sacred
place
is
a
guarded
secret
i
can't
take
you
there
myself
giles
they
begin
to
climb
up
a
dune
i'll
have
to
perform
a
ritual
to
transfer
my
guardianship
of
you
temporarily
to
to
a
guide
this'll
do
he
stops
and
begins
putting
the
stuff
down
a
guide
but
no
food
or
water
so
it
leads
me
to
the
sacred
place
and
then
a
week
later
it
leads
you
to
my
bleached
bones
buffy
please
it
takes
more
than
a
week
to
bleach
bones
buffy
grins
giles
kneels
on
the
ground
and
begins
arranging
the
twigs
around
himself
so
how's
it
start
i
uh
jump
out
of
the
circle
and
then
jump
back
in
it
and
then
um

giles
embarrassed
i
shake
my
gourd
i
know
this
ritual
the
ancient
shamans
were
next
called
upon
to
do
the
hokeypokey
and
turn
themselves
around
giles
straightens
up
gives
her
a
sour
look
go
quest
buffy
makes
an
amused
face
giles
looks
embarrassed
he
sighs
rolls
his
eyes
jumps
into
the
circle
of
twigs
jumps
out
and
shakes
the
gourd
nothing
seems
to
happen
he
and
buffy
look
at
each
other
and
that's
what
it's
all
about
cut
to
spike
in
his
crypt
dancing
around
in
sparring
mode
what
you
searching
for
slayer
a
weak
spot
hmm
we
see
that
he's
circling
around
the
buffybot
who
holds
a
stake
in
one
hand
she
is
no
longer
wearing
the
jacket
but
still
wears
the
pink
skirt
and
sleeveless
blouse
try
me
give
me
the
best
you've
got
she
lunges
at
him
with
a
very
lame
stabbing
movement
and
he
ducks
out
of
the
way
ooh
spike
grabs
her
from
behind
with
one
arm
around
her
neck
and
the
other
grabbing
her
hand
oh
buffybot
panting
is
that
your
best
slayer
no
why
not
i
i
wanna
hurt
you
but
i
can't
resist
the
sinister
attraction
of
your
cold
and
muscular
body
maybe
i
should
repay
you
for
your
gentleness
maybe
i
should
let
you
go
no
no
spike
never
let
me
go
you
know
you
should
be
afraid
of
me
i'm
bad
buffybot
seductively
you
are
you're
very
very
bad
suddenly
she
twists
out
of
his
grasp
and
flings
him
across
the
room
he
lands
on
his
back
on
the
bed
the
buffybot
jumps
on
top
of
him
straddling
him
and
puts
her
stake
against
his
chest
are
you
gonna
do
it
that
way
buffybot
grinning
no
she
grabs
the
neck
of
his
tshirt
and
rips
it
open
as
spike
grins
then
she
puts
the
stake
against
his
bare
chest
this
way
spike
raises
his
eyebrows
you
can't
do
it
i
could
never
do
it
buffybot
drops
the
stake
i'm
helpless
against
you
you
fiend
spike
shoves
her
off
him
buffybot
smiling
oh
she
rolls
aside
onto
the
floor
and
lands
on
her
back
spike
lands
on
top
of
her
pinning
her
wrists
down
he
kisses
her
and
she
kisses
him
back
spike
whispers
buffy
he
slides
down
her
body
as
the
camera
stays
on
her
face
cut
to
giles
sitting
on
the
sand
in
the
middle
of
the
circle
of
sticks
he
has
the
book
open
and
reads
aloud
in
swahili
cut
to
closer
shot
of
his
face
as
he
continues
to
speak
cut
to
buffy
walking
across
the
sand
we
can
hear
giles
still
reading
aloud
the
background
music
is
a
woman
vocalizing
buffy
hears
a
growling
noise
and
stops
looks
to
her
left
we
see
a
mountain
lion
sitting
on
the
sand
about
thirty
feet
away
hello
kitty
the
lion
begins
to
walk
and
buffy
follows
it
they
go
through
a
passageway
made
by
two
large
outcroppings
of
rock
they
come
out
on
a
large
expanse
of
sandy
desert
dotted
with
small
bushes
or
trees
buffy
goes
over
to
a
rock
and
sits
on
it
looking
around
i
know
this
place
cut
to
tara
closing
a
door
she
turns
away
and
we
see
there's
a
vial
in
her
hand
she
walks
away
from
the
door
into
the
room
we
see
xander
behind
a
counter
it's
his
apartment
he
comes
out
from
behind
the
counter
okay
warning
spell's
all
set
so
that's
it
we're
all
protected
up
for
the
night
they
walk
farther
into
the
room
we
see
anya
sitting
on
one
sofa
in
the
background
dawn
sits
on
another
reading
well
iit's
probably
not
as
good
as
willow
could
do
she's
a
natural
with
magic
in
just
the
time
i've
known
her
she's
already
blown
right
past
me
so
when
the
whiz
kid
gets
back
from
chem
lab
can
you
have
her
you
know
bulk
up
the
spell
a
little
if
you
want
maybe
while
anya
and
i
go
do
a
quick
patrol
i
don't
see
why
we
have
to
patrol
just
'cause
buffy's
away
anya
gets
up
walks
over
to
them
i'd
rather
stay
home
and
watch
television
dawn
watches
anya
go
past
her
shot
of
a
pair
of
earrings
on
the
side
table
next
to
the
sofa
that
anya
just
vacated
tara
os
oh

history
channel

table
salem
witch
trial
stuff
which
is
only
gonna
get
her
all
upset
anya
os
oh
i
was
there
it
really
wasn't
that
bad
anya
dawn
picks
up
the
earrings
and
puts
them
in
her
pocket
see
if
you
were
really
a
witch
you
could
do
a
spell
to
escape
cut
to
a
shot
of
the
three
in
the
foreground
and
dawn
in
the
background
so
really
it
was
only
bad
for
the
falsely
accused
and
well

never
have
a
good
time

dawn
turns
from

dawn
walks
away
from
the
table
toward
the
others
the
camera
stays
on
the
window

panting
yes
uh
hello

the
bot
tries
to
take
his
hand
but
he
pulls
it
away
uh
buffy's
back
early
i
see
lots
of
patrolling
all
around
tonight
then
is
it
the
bot
takes
his
arm
and
he
pretends
it
hurts
pulls
it
away
ow
hey
give
a
fella
a
break
there

she
smiles
and

closer
to
him
but
he
moves
away
going
closer
to
xander
and
anya
uh
i'm
glad
you're
all
here
uh
'cause
uh
'cause
the
place
is
crawling
with
vamps
tonight
uh
tons
of
'em
i
uh
think
we
oughta
split
up
we
haven't
seen
any
vamps
are
you
sure
there's
they
hear
a
noise
and
all
look
to
the
side
three
vamps
come
around
a
corner
you're
right
yep
guess
so
the
vamps
rush
at
them
the
buffybot
kicks
one
and
he
falls
back
spike
engages
the
second
vamp
while
xander
and
anya
take
the
third
the
bot
fights
like
buffy
anya
circles
around
with
her
stake
while
xander
exchanges
blows
with
the
vamp
spike
kicks
his
spike
be
careful
the
bot
kicks
her
vamp
backward
shot
of
two
of
glory's
demons
watching
the
action
from
afar
spike
grabs
his
vamp
by
the
arm
and
hits
him
in
the
back
the
third
vamp
has
xander
on
the
ground
and
anya
runs
behind
him
xander
gets
his
feet
on
the
vamp's
chest
and
shoves
him
back
right
at
anya
who
stakes
him
the
bot
punches
her
vamp
several
times
and
he
goes
down
spike
is
still
struggling
with
his
foe
no
get
away
from
him
shot
of
the
two
demons
still
watching
the
bot
stakes
her
vamp
spike
has
his
vamp
kneeling
on
the
ground
the
bot
tosses
her
stake
to
spike
who
catches
it
and
stakes
the
last
vamp
anya
helps
xander
up
spike
and
the
buffybot
come
over
to
them
i
think
that
was
probably
the
big
action
for
the
night
you
two
can
toddle
on
home
if
you
want
uh
buffy
buffybot
smiling
yes
spike
and
i
will
do
it
alone
you
guys
head
home
xander
looks
suspicious
but
he
and
anya
leave
anyway
spike
and
the
bot
watch
them
go
the
bot
frowns
and
wiggles
her
shoulders
spike
comes
around
in
front
of
her
hmm
i
don't
understand
this
ii
did
the
slaying
i
should
be
spike
leering
satisfied
buffybot
nods
pouts

all
hot
buffybot
spike
grinning

buffybot
suggestively
you
better
feel
me
to
make
sure
i
can
do
that
they
kiss
cut
to
xander
and
anya
walking
through
the
dark
graveyard
out
the
front
gates
they
turn
and
start
walking
down
the
sidewalk
anya
coughs
i
breathed
in
like
a
quart
of
vampire
dust
that
can't
be
good
anya
putting
her
stake
away
in
a
coat
pocket
i
wish

slayerwatcher
stuff
probably
some
silly
ritual
with
an
enchanted
prairie
dog
or

a
little
spacy
anya

xander
stops
walking
hey
she
never
asked
about
dawn

true
something's
wrong
moaning
noises
xander
and
anya
look
back
at
the
graveyard
shot
of
something
blurry
impossible
to
see
through
the
leaves
of
bushes
that
separate
the
graveyard
from
the
street
xander
softly
i
hear
something
he
gestures
to
anya
to
be
quiet
as
they
move
toward
the
bushes
shot
of
spike
and
the
bot
still
in
the
graveyard
spike
lies
on
his
back
with
the
bot
straddling
him
and
rocking
up
and
down
her
skirt
covers
their
hips
oh

he

and
leaves
anya
shrugs
to
herself
cut
to
buffy
asleep
on
a
rock
there's
a
fire
burning
nearby
she
sits
up
hello

there
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
we
see
the
first
slayer
see
episode
restless
buffy
stares
cut
to
spike
leaning
against
a
pillar
smoking
a
cigarette
his
hair
is
again
messy
rustling
noises
spike
looks
toward
the
door
as
the
buffy
bot
rises
from
the
floor
in
front
of
him
they
both
look
over
at
the
noise
who's
that
spike
begins
fastening
his
pants
uh
down
there
spike
points
to
the
trapdoor
leading
down
to
the
cavern
and
uh
no
matter
what
don't
come
out
till
i
get
you
okay
buffybot
nods
okay
she
walks
over
to
the
trapdoor
and
starts
down
spike
looks
toward
the
door
as
it
opens
and
xander
comes
in
oh
it's
you
xander
closes
door
i
saw
you
in
the
cemetery
with
buffy
yeah
spike
with
bravado
can't
see
how
it's
any
business
of
yours
it
is
my
business
because
buffy's
my
friend
and
she's
gone
through
some
stuff
lately
that
well
it's
affected
her
and
you're
taking
advantage
of
her
spike
sighs
she's
upset
about
her
mum
spike
takes
a
drag
on
his
cigarette
and
if
she
turns
to
me
for
comfort
well
i'm
not
gonna
deny
it
to
her
i'm
not
a
monster
yes
you
are
a
monster
vampires
are
monsters
they
make
monster
movies
about
them
spike
sarcastic
well
yeah
you
got
me
there
xander
grabs
spike
by
the
front
of
his
shirt
spike
buffy
has
lost
of
friends
and
we
love
her
very
much
and
we'll
do
whatever
it
takes
to
protect
her
now
if
that
means
killing
you
then
well
that's
just
a
bonus
the
door
opens
and
jinx
appears
gentlemen
jinx
begins
to
enter
followed
by
more
demons
i'm
so
sorry
to
intrude
but
i
wondered
if
i
might
beg
a
moment
of
your
time
spike
to
xander
friends
of
yours
jinx
punches
xander
in
the
stomach
guess
not
spike
kicks
jinx
xander
struggles
to
his
feet
as
the
fight
continues
xander
takes
another
kick
to
the
chin
and
goes
down
again
spike
exchanges
more
blows
until
two
of
the
demons
get
him
by
the
arms
he
headbutts
another
of
them
tie
his
hands
glory
will
want
him
restrained
spike
struggling
let
me
go
careful
with
him
she
will
want
the
key
intact
key
who's
a
key
i'm
not
the
jinx
stuffs
something
in
spike's
mouth
spike
continues
struggling
and
muffled
yelling
as
the
demons
drag
him
out
blackout
act
iii

open
on
buffy
at
the
fireside
throughout
the
ensuing
scene
we
see
the
first
slayer
through
the
flames
sometimes
obscuring
her
entirely
i
know
you
you're
the
first
slayer
this
is
a
form
i
am
the
guide
i
have
a
few
questions
about
being
the
slayer
what
about
love
not
just
boyfriend
love
you
think
you're
losing
your
ability
to
love
ii
didn't
say
that
buffy
sighs
yeah
you're
afraid
that
being
the
slayer
means
losing
your
humanity
does
it
you
are
full
of
love
you
love
with
all
of
your
soul
it's
brighter
than
the
fire
blinding
that's
why
you
pull
away
from
it
buffy
surprised
i'm
full
of
love
i'm
not
losing
it
only
if
you
reject
it
love
is
pain
and
the
slayer
forges
strength
from
pain
love
give
forgive
risk
the
pain
it
is
your
nature
love
will
bring
you

glory
comes

shoves
murk
away
and
impossible
glory
walks
in
a
circle
around
spike
he

back
with
his
hands
pinned
underneath
him
as

groans
in

climbs
on

of
him
maybe
there's
something
on
the
inside
she
takes
one
finger
with
its
long
red
fingernail
and
thrusts
it
into
spike's
stomach

screaming
cut
to
shot
of
the
buffy

a
flap
of
skin
is
peeled
back
revealing
her
inner
workings
willow
is
poking
at
the

sputtering
noises
pull
out
to

in
the
magic
shop
the

is
bent
over
the
table
tara
looks
across
the
table
is
it
weird
we
see
buffy
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
dawn
sits
beside
her
oh
yeah
buffy
walks
closer
at
least
it's
not
a
very
good
copy
buffy
sits
in
the
chair
next
to
the
bot
i
mean
buffy
lays
her
head
down
on
the
table
to
look
into
the
bot's
face
look
at
it
uh
yeah
willow
looks
up
at
tara

enter
buffy
gets
up
what'd
you
guys
do
with
spike
and
please
let
the
story
have
a
dusty
ending
we
dumped
him
back
in
his
crypt
tried
to
find
out
if
he'd
told
her
anything
but
he
was
too
badly
beaten
to
make
much
sense
well
even
if
he
told
her
he'd
just
lie
to
us
about
it
anyway
right
yeah
you
can
count
on
it
but
i
have
to
know
now
if
he
did
give
us
up
dawn
and
i
need
to
get
out
of
town
i
mean
she
could
be
on
her
way
right
now

looks
alarmed

to
dawn
but
uh
not
to
worry
you

all
be
perfectly
safe

smiles
we're
safe
right
and
uh

built
a
robot

found
where

broken
some
of
these
wires
got
fried

crispy
willow
smiles

an
easy
fix
buffy
gives
her
an
astonished
look

feel
kind
of
bad
for
the
guy

all
whupped
and
his
best
toy

taken
away

travesty
completely
on

just
the
guy
was
so
thrashed
buffy
considers
this
cut
to
spike
lying
in
his
crypt
daylight
outside
his
facial
bruises
have
swelled
up
and
his
hair
is
still
messy
the
door
slams
open
the
buffy
bot
stands
there
no
longer
wearing
her
jacket
but
still
in
the
pink
blouse
and
skirt
she
walks
briskly
over
to
the
coffin
where
spike's
lying
spike
you're
covered
in
sexy
wounds
spike
turns
his
head
toward
her
his
eyes
are
swollen
mostly
shut
yeah
spike
starts
to
sit
up
i
feel
real
sexy
spike
slowly
pulls
himself
upright
where
you
been
i
fell
down
and
got
confused
willow
fixed
me
she's
gay

fixed
you
i
thought

melt
you
into
scrap

were
confused
too
buffybot
smiles

wanna
ravage
me
now
spike
weakly
give
us
a
minute
got
some
bones

mending
why
did
you
let
that
glory
hurt
you
she
wanted
to
know
who
the
key
was
oh

i
can
tell
her
and
then
you'll
buffybot
turns
to
leave
no
spike
coughs
as
she
turns
back
you
can't
ever
glory
never
finds
out
why
spike
quietly
'cause
buffy
the
other
not
so
pleasant
buffy
anything

to
dawn

destroy
her
i
couldn't
live
her
bein'
in
that
much
pain

glory
kill
me
first
nearly
bloody
did
she
frowns
slightly
then
leans
forward
and
kisses
him
softly
on
the
lips
spike
starts
to
kiss
her
back
frowns
and
pulls
away
shot
of
her
looking
at
him
spike
stares
at
her
in
amazement
she
turns
to
walk
away
and
my
robot
buffy
turns
back
the
robot
is
gone
the
robot
was
gross
and
obscene
spike
lowers
his
head
it
wasn't
supposed
to
buffy
don't
that
thing
it
it
wasn't
even
real
she
turns
and
takes
a
few
more
steps
toward
the
door
spike
sits
with
his
head
hanging
buffy
pauses
again
but
doesn't
turn
back
to
him
what
you
did
for
me
and
dawn
that
was
real
spike
lifts
his
head
to
look
at
her
she
turns
to
look
at
him
over
her
shoulder
i
won't
forget
it
she
walks
out
closing
the
door
behind
her
spike
stares
after
her
blackout
joss
whedon
