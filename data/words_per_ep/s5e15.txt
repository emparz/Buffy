episode
begins

buffy
in
the
workout
room
punching
something
giles
is
in
the
background
sitting
and
watching
buffy
punches
spike
buffy
more
punches
spike
wants
me
how
obscene
is
that
well
it
is
very
strange
i
can't
imagine
what
he's
thinking
giles
stands
uh
not
not
that
you're
not
uh
attractive
buffy
stops
punching
i
feel
gross
you
know
like
like
dirty
she
resumes
punching
we
see
part
of
the
thing
she's
punching
which
looks
like
a
punching
bag
that's
ridiculous
you
can't
be
responsible
for
what
spike
thinks
or
feels
buffy
stops
punching
well
aren't
i
responsible
i
mean
something
about
me
had
to
make
him
feel
that
right
something
that
made
him
say
'woof
that's
the
one
for
me'
she
resumes
punching
very
violently
and
finishes
by
kneeing
the
target
sharply
buffy
i
think
you
should
perhaps
calm
down
me
too
we
see
that
buffy's
target
is
actually
xander
in
a
huge
padded
suit
and
fencing
mask
it
forces
his
arms
to
stand
straight
out
at
his
sides
basically
immobile
giles
and
buffy
look
at
him
with
concern
oh
puffy
xander
uh
i'm
sorry
i
got
guess
i
got
carried
away
buffy
removes
the
mask
gives
it
to
giles
are
you
okay
i'm
alive
i
can
tell
'cause
of
the
pain
do
you
wanna
sit
down
i'm
not
that
bendy
xander
points
at
the
wall
i
could
lean
i'll
get
some
ice
buffy
helps
puffy
xander
waddle
over
to
the
wall
and
lean
against
it
here
xander
loud
sigh
comfy
oh
yeah
this
leaning
this
is
the
stuff
that's
my
secret
to
attracting
men
you
know
it's
simple
really
you
slap
'em
around
a
bit
you
torture
'em
you
make
their
lives
a
living
hell
buff
and
sure
the
nice
guys
they'll
run
away
but
every
now
and
then
you'll
meet
a
real
prince
of
a
guy
like
spike
who
gets
off
on
it
buffy

xander
jerks
his
head
sideways
stand
me
up
buffy
helps
him
stand
up
straight
he
loses
his
balance
and
slants
toward
buffy
who
puts
her
hands
on
the
puffy
stomach
to
stabilize
him
the
problem
is
not
you
don't
do
this
to
yourself
please
it's
just
i
just
wanna
know
that
there's
gonna
be
another
good
one
one
that
i
won't
chase
away
there
will
be
promise
he's
out
there
he
could
come
along
any
minute
yeah
and
the
minute
after
that
i
can
terrify
him
with
my
alarming
strength
and
remarkable
selfinvolvement
what
i
don't
think
you're
like
that
maybe
i
could
change
you
know
i
could
i
could
work
harder
i
could
spend
less
time
slaying
i
could
laugh
at
his
jokes
i
mean
men
like
that
right
the
the
jokelaughingat
or
maybe
you
could
just
be
buffy
he'll
see
your
amazing
heart
and
he'll
fall
in
love
with
you
buffy
looks
touched
xander
that's
aw
she
puts
her
arms
around
puffy
xander
and
rests
her
head
on
his
big
puffy
chest
this
is
the
day
you
choose
to
hug
me
xander
shakes
head
sighs
buffy
mm
you
ever
think
maybe
the
reason
you
haven't
found
a
great
relationship
on
the
hellmouth
is
because
it's
a
hellmouth
seems
to
me
it's
a
pretty
terrible
place
to
try
to
build
anything
buffy
closes
her
eyes
looking
peaceful
mm
cut
to
sunnydale
main
street
night
a
car
comes
around
a
corner
and
stops
by
the
sidewalk
the
passenger
door
opens
and
a
young
woman
april
gets
out
closes
the
door
she
is
wearing
a
very
short
very
tight
pink
flowered
dress
she
has
long
straight
dark
hair
and
a
perpetual
smile
she
leans
in
to
talk
to
the
driver
of
the
car
thank
you
for
picking
me
up
i'm
very
grateful
for
the
ride
you
sure
you
want
to
get
out
here
i
mean
this
place
is
kinda

driver
guy
looks
around
what
are
you
looking
for
in
sunnydale
anyway
april
looks
around
with
a
smile
true
love
wolf
howl
opening
credits
act
i

fade
in
on
the
summers
living
room
day
joyce
is
wearing
a
black
evening
gown
with
large
flowers
on
it
she
is
spinning
around
buffy
and
dawn
sit
on
the
sofa
watching
i
might
like
it
more
than
the
others
can
you
spin
around
again
joyce
spins
again
buffy
smiles
ooh
i'm
not
sure
once
more
joyce
spins
again
smiles
at
them
now
could
you
go
the
other
way
joyce
starts
to
spin
stops
and
looks
at
them
you're
messing
with
me
dawn
laughs
we
just
wanted
to
see
how
many
times
we
could
get
you
to
do
it
was
that
five
or
four
and
a
half
joyce
holds
out
her
arms
so
is
anyone
gonna
talk
about
my
dress
i
like
it
you
sure
i
mean
it's
not
too
momish
oh
that
was
why
i
liked
it
dawn
joyce
looks
disappointed
you're
both
crazy
it's
not
momish
at
all
buffy
joyce
looks
relieved
it's
sexy
it
screams
'randy
sex
kitten
buy
me
one
drink
and
i'll'
buffy
pauses
oh
wait
that's
not
really
good
either
dawn
shakes
her
head
in
agreement
oh
god
what
time
is
it
buffy
checks
her
watch
423
you
have
lots
of
time
until
seven
vast
acres
of
time
in
which
you
could
plant
crops
now
tell
me
about
this
brian
and
what
his
intentions
are
maybe
he's
a
gigolo
was
his
shirt
all
shiny
dawn
she
and
buffy
exchange
an
amused
look
no
he
works
for
a
publishing
house
he's
a
nice
normal
guy
okay
i
think
i've
heard
of
those
he
came
to
the
gallery
my
first
day
back
when
i
was
you
know
kinda
shaky
starting
over
and
he
asked
a
question
about
these
antique
cameos
joyce
sighs
and
i
was
so
lost
because
carol
had
been
doing
the
ordering
while
i
was
sick
well
it
turned
out
that
he
didn't
know
anything
about
them
either
so
we
had
a
lot
to
talk
about
dawn
smiling
so
what's
the
plan
for
tonight
joyce
smiling
dinner
and
then
a
movie
joyce
frowns
or
maybe
it
was
a
movie
and
then
dinner
which
might
be
better
because
you
know
then
we
could
talk
about
the
movie
joyce
buffy
nods
or
maybe
a
movie
isn't
a
good
idea
at
all
because
well
you
know
you
can't
talk
during
and
and
then
you
know
what's
the
point
of
any
of
it
joyce
dawn
shakes
her
head
oh
and
about
the
restaurant
do
you
think
that
it
should
be
one
with
candles
and
romantic
music
or
is
that
pushing
it
buffy
what
do
you
think
should
i
you
know
try
to
make
things
romantic
or
sorta
let
him
set
the
pace
oh
no
buffy
stands
walks
across
to
other
end
of
the
sofa
love
doctor
buffy
is
not
in
i
am
not
qualified
to
give
dating
advice
i've
had
exactly
two
boyfriends
and
they
both
left
really
left
left
town
left
honey
you
just
had
some
bad
luck
well
you're
going
to
that
spring
break
party
tonight
maybe
you'll
find
someone
there
mmhmm
or
maybe
brian
has
a
son
and
mom
and
i
can
go
on
some
unspeakably
awkward
double
dates
oh
god
joyce
puts
hands
on
her
chest
brian
what
time
is
it
now
buffy
checks
watch
424
joyce
nervous
you
sure
the
dress
is
okay
hmm
spin
again
real
fast
this
time
joyce
gives
them
an
amusedscolding
look
cut
to
tara
and
anya
walking
along
the
uc
sunnydale
campus
day
willow's
good
at
all
that
computer
stuff
but
me
not
so
much
do
you
really
understand
all
that
oh
well
at
first
it
was
confusing
just
the
idea
of
computers
was
like
'whoa
i'm
eleven
hundred
years
old
i
had
trouble
adjusting
to
the
idea
of
lutherans'
i
go
online
sometimes
but
everyone's
spelling
is
really
bad
and
it's
depressing
but
you
have
to
try
online
trading
it's
great
the
secret
is
avoiding
the
tech
companies
everyone
was
jumping
on
and
and
going
with
the
smaller
firms
that
supply
the
basic
components
uhhuh
anyway
i
took
the
money
from
working
for
giles
and
i
tripled
it
tripled
like
first
money
then
money
money
money
yes
i'm
thinking
about
buying
something
very
expensive
maybe
an
antelope
april
walks
up
to
them
with
a
big
smile
hi
anya
and
tara
look
at
each
other
then
at
april
hi

a
warren
tara
anya
shakes
her
head
well

righty
no
harm
in
asking
thanks
she
walks
off
with
a
smile
the
others
watch
her
go
up
to
a
guy
sitting
on
a
bench

ends
with
with
you
leaving

risking
a
tragic
chain
reaction

over

back

watch
as

gets
up
broken

falling
all
around

he
stands
outside

and
looks
in
through
the
now
glassless
window
bloody

buffy
pauses

buffy
stops
smiling
um
but
you

generally
speaking

think

need
to
take
a
second
and
stop
looking
for
your
boyfriend
april
grabs
buffy
by
the
upper
arms
and
flings
her
backwards
she
flies
back
several
yards
and
lands
on
the
floor
with
an
expression
of
pain
grabbing
her
arm
april
os
i
have
to
find
him
april
walks
over
to
where
buffy
is
sitting
up
clutching
her
arm
in
pain
if
i
hurt
you
just
now
i'm
sorry
and
i
hope
that
your
boyfriend
will
take
good
care
of
you
april
walks
off
as
ben
xander
willow
anya
and
tara
rush
over
to
buffy
buffy
pouts
sadly
as
she
watches
april
leave
cut
to
a
student
lounge
in
the
dorm
buffy
is
pacing
still
holding
her
arm
the
scoobies
are
sitting
in
various
chairs
ow
i
don't
know
about
you
guys
but
i've
had
it
with
superstrong
little
women
who
aren't
me
well
at
least
she
didn't
do
too
much
damage
are
you
kidding
doubleglazed
windows
ain't
cheap
and
the
jamb
needs
to
be
completely
repaired
xander
pauses
oh
dear
god
i'm
the
grownup
who
sees
the
world
through
my
job
i'm
like
my
uncle
dave
the
plumber
i
must
be
shunned
okay
so
what
do
you
guys
think
she
is
i
mean
this
may
sound
nuts
but
i
kinda
got
the
impression
that
she
was
a
robot
everyone
nods
in
complete
agreement
oh
yeah
robot
yeah
i
was
gonna
say
robot
what
do
you
think
she
wants
warren
whoever
that
is
it's
gotta
be
the
guy
that
built
her
it's
an
unusual
name
there's
hardly
any
except
warren
beatty
and
you
know
president
harding
itit's
probably
not
either
of
them
will
can
you
track
down
this
guy
with
only
a
first
name
willow
nods
given
enough
time
i
can
get
a
list
of
the
sunnydale
students
named
warren
tonight
but
then
we'll
have
to
call
them
or
go
to
their
dorms
so
we
probably
can't
start
narrowing
it
down
till
tomorrow
buffy
frowns
she
could
do
a
lot
of
damage
by
then
to
who
spike
see
how
vigorously
i
don't
care
xander
buffy
smiles
she
was
looking
for
this
warren
but
it
didn't
sound
like
she
wanted
to
hurt
him
she
said
he's
her
boyfriend
i
agree
i'm
not
sure
this
is
a
code
red
hey
is
there
a
code
pink
we
need
more
codes
willow
tara
smiles
at
her
okay
we'll
track
down
warren
tomorrow
tonight
i
better
go
rescue
giles
he's
been
watching
dawn
while
my
mom's
out
on
her
date
and
i
have
a
feeling
there's
only
so
much
he
can
take
oh
giles
and
dawnie
i
bet
they
ended
up
having
a
blast
cut
to
giles
and
buffy
standing
in
the
summers
foyer
by
the
open
door
dear
god
buffy
there's
only
so
much
i
can
take
we're
going
to
have
to
change
the
system
a
fourteenyearold's
too
old
to
be
babysat
and
it's
not
fair
on
her
buffy
nods
grins
what'd
she
make
you
do
um
well
we
listened
to
aggressively
cheerful
music
sung
by
people
chosen
for
their
ability
to
dance
then
we
ate
cookie
dough
and
talked
about
boys
buffy
laughs
i'm
sorry
i'm
very
very
sorry
but
if
it
makes
you
feel
any
better
my
'fun
time
buffy
party
night'
involved
watching
a
robot
throw
spike
through
a
window
buffy
giles
looks
interested
so
if
you
wanna
trade
buffy
pauses
no
wait
i
wouldn't
give
that
memory
up
for
anything
a
robot
sounds
interesting
we're
gonna
work
on
it
in
the
morning
i
mean
unless
you
wanna
stay
for
a
while
and
then
you
and
i
could
joyce
appears
behind
giles
entering
the
house
with
a
big
smile
who

goodnight

joyce
smiles
walks
past
buffy
to
put
her
purse
down
it
all

pretty
tame
to
me
well

your
standards
it
could
seem
pretty

joyce
pauses
oh

i
left
my
bra
in
his
car
buffy
looks
shocked
and
horrified
mother
i'm

buffy
sighs

i
left
it
in
the
restaurant
buffy
puts
her
hands
over
her
ears
and
starts
running
up
the
stairs
no
more
no
more
no
more
joyce
yelling
up
the
stairs
at
her
on
the
dessert
cart
buffy
os
faintly
i

walks
down
the
steps
across
the
lawn
and
over
to
the
next
house
knocks
on
that
door
cut
to
magic
shop
day
buffy
and
the
scoobies
sit
around
the
table
giles
stands
next
to
it
willow
is
using
her
computer
ibook
and
you're
certain
she
was
a
robot
absolutely
well
she
practically
had
'genuine
molded
plastic'
stamped
on
her
ass
giles
and
willow
give
her
looks
just
tryin'
a
little
spicy
talk
tara
willow
smiles
she
was
looking
for
someone
named
warren
willow's
already
checked
the
sunnydale
enrollment
and
got
nothin'
i
found
one
warren
but
he
moved
out
of
the
country
a
year
ago
i'm
checking
nearby
schools
whoever
he
is
he
knows
his
stuff
that
girl
well
xander
buffy
looks
at
him
that
was
a
nicelookin'
girl
tara
gives
xander
a
dubious
look
it's
okay
for
him
to
say
that
'cause
i
know
that
he
really
loves
me
only
xander
leans
over
to
take
anya's
hand
buffy
watches
this
a
little
sadly
giles
os
is
there
something
the
rest
of
us
could
be
doing
what
can
we
do
oh
do
you
have
any
books
on
robots
oh
yes
dozens
there's
an
enormous
amount
of
research
we
should
do
before
no
i'm
lying
i
haven't
got
squat
i
just
like
to
see
xander
squirm
xander
fake
laugh
funny
charming
and
funny
hey
i
think
i
found
him
a
warren
mears
he
went
to
sunnydale
high
with
us
for
a
semester
and
then
he
went
to
the
tech
college
over
in
dutton
i've
got
a
local
address
where
his
folks
still
live
willow
writing
it
down
he's
probably
home
for
spring
break
well
i'll
go
talk
to
him
buffy
takes
the
paper
from
willow
no
no
no
no
no
wait
we
don't
know
what
you're
walking
into
giles
looks
behind
him
notices
a
customer
standing
by
the
counter
uh
we
have
no
idea
what
his
motive
is
for
building
this
thing
giles
stands
um
don't
you
think
se's
just
tara
makes
insinuating
face
yeah
she's
just
sort
of
a
willow
makes
the
same
face
she's
a
sexbot
xander
to
giles
i
mean
what
guy
doesn't
dream
about
that
giles
walks
off
to
help
the
customer
xander
wistfully
beautiful
girl
with
no
other
thought
but
to
please
you
willing
to
do
anything
he
looks
up
shots
of
the
four
girls
staring
at
him
xander
laughs
nervously
too
many
girls
i
miss
oz
he'd
get
it
he
wouldn't
say
anything
but
xander
clears
throat
he'd
get
it
xander
willow
turns
her
attention
back
to
the
computer
why
would
anyone
do
that
if
they
could
have
a
real
live
person
maybe
he
couldn't
find
a
real
person
oh
come
on
the
guy's
just
a
big
wedge
of
sleaze
don't
make
excuses
for
him
giles
finishes
helping
the
customer
and
returns
to
sit
with
them
i'm
not
i'm
just
saying
people
get
lonely
and
maybe
having
someone
around
even
someone
you
made
up
maybe
it's
easier
shot
of
buffy
looking
pensive
but
it's
so
weird
i
mean
everyone
wants
a
nice
normal
person
to
share
with
but
this
guy
if
he
couldn't
find
that
i
guess
it's
kinda
sad
shot
of
buffy
staring
at
her
hands
cut
to
buffy
walking
into
the
workout
room
looking
at
the
piece
of
paper
with
ben's
phone
number
on
it
she
sighs
picks
up
the
phone
puts
it
down
picks
it
up
again
cut
to
glory's
apartment
we
see
glory
from
the
chest
up
bare
shoulders
she's
sweaty
and
gasping
breathing
rhythmically
the
phone
begins
to
ring
glory
morphs
into
ben

cut

exterior
shot

day
so

girl
troubles
cut
to
inside
buffy
sits
on
the
sofa
while
warren
paces
they're
not
talking
to
you
you're
not
gettin'
dates
you
start
thinking
'hey
this
isn't
fair'
yeah
i
mean
i
felt
like
i
deserved
to
have
someone
you
know
i
mean
everyone
deserves
to
have
someone
so
naturally
you
turned
to
manufacturing
kinda
and
how
long
did
it
take
to
build
yourself
that
little
toy
oh
no
she's
not
a
toy
i
mean
i
know
what
you're
thinking
but
she's
more
than
that
i'm
sure
she
has
many
exciting
laborsaving
attachments
no
i
made
her
to
love
me
cut
to
april
walking
down
the
street
day
i
mean
she
cares
about
what
i
care
about
and
she
wants
to
be
with
me
she
listens
to
me
and
supports
me
cut
back
to
warren's
house
i
didn't
make
a
toy
i
made
a
girlfriend
a
girlfriend
are
you
saying
are
you
in
love
with
her
i
really
thought
i
would
be
cut
to
april
walking
down
more
streets
looking
around
i
mean
she's
perfect
i
don't
know
i
i
guess
it
was
too
easy
and
predictable
cut
back
to
warren's
house
you
know
she
got
boring
warren
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
she
was
exactly
what
i
wanted
and
i
didn't
want
her
warren
laughs
crazily
i
thought
i
was
going
crazy
really
you
then
something
happened
warren
sits
next
to
her
katrina
was
in
my
engineering
seminar
and
she
was
really
funny
and
cool
you
know
she
was
always
givin'
me
a
hard
time
real
unpredictable
she
builds
these
little
model
monorails
that
run
with
magnets
and

warren
pauses
looks
at
buffy
anyway
warren
shrugs
i
fell
in
love
with
katrina
swell
romance
and
magnetic
trains
but
first
you
decided
to
take
april
out
of
the
box
cut
to
april
still
walking
play
with
her
for
five
minutes
and
then
what
you
got
bored
decided
to
dump
her
tell
her
to
go
away
cut
back
to
the
house
kinda
and
she
got
mad
she
didn't
go
huh
okay
i
didn't
really
dump
her
as
much
as
i
uh
went
out
and
uh
didn't
come
back
warren
buffy
stares
i
left
her
i
left
her
in
my
dorm
room
buffy
angry
you
left
her
in
your
dorm
room
well
i
figured
i
could
just
kinda
get
away
until
her
batteries
gave
out
which
should
have
been
days
ago
did
you
even
tell
her
i
mean
did
you
even
give
her
a
chance
to
fix
what
was
wrong
i
didn't
need
to
fix
anything
i
mean
her
batteries
were
supposed
to
run
down
really
they
should
be
completely
dead
by
now
so
why
aren't
they
i
don't
i
don't
know
i
mean
maybe
uh
she
must
be
recharging
them
somehow
warren
this
is
important
is
she
dangerous
she's
only
programmed
to
be
in
love
then
she's
dangerous
do
you
have
any
idea
how
to
find
her
well
she's
looking
for
me
so
my
guess
is
she's
probably
pretty
close
cut
to
katrina
walking
along
quickly
approaching
a
children's
playground
april
intercepts
her
hi
katrina
stares
then
makes
a
disgusted
noise
and
tries
to
walk
around
april
april
moves
to
block
her
path

you
know
where
warren
is

april
pulls
katrina
toward
her
turns
her
around
and
wraps
her
arms
around
katrina
pinning
her
arms
to
her

april

will
be
right
again
buffy
nods
it'll
be
fine
april
still
smiling
when
things
are
sad
you
just
have
to
be
patient
april
her
speech
begins
to
slow
because
because
every
cloud
has
a
silver
lining
and
when
life
gives
you
lemons
make
lemonade
clouds
and
lemonade
huh
yes
and
and

april
her
voice
gets
deeper
like
a
tape
running
too
slow
things
are
always
darkest
before
she
stops
frozen
with
a
small
smile
on
her
face
her
eyes
stay
open
buffy
looks
at
her
with
a
frown
then
looks
down
pensively
the
camera
pulls
up
and
out
to
a
wide
aerial
shot
as
buffy
turns
away
then
turns
back
still
sitting
on
the
swing
next
to
april
cut
to
xander
fixing
the
window
in
the
dorm
wearing
a
toolbelt
he
pushes
some
small
chips
of
wood
underneath
the
bottom
of
the
new
window
see
you
construct
the
wood
jamb
and
frame
the
glass
into
it
and
that's
what
you
set
into
the
opening
we
see
buffy
sitting
nearby
watching
yeah
one
of
the
cool
things
about
that
you
see
is
uh
the
jamb
can
be
shimmed
to
be
square
even
if
the
opening
isn't
shimmed
is
that
even
a
real
word
do
you
have
any
idea
what
you're
talking
about
yeah
i
do
xander
smiles
scary
isn't
it
i
think
i've
actually
turned
into
someone
you
want
around
after
a
crazed
robot
attack
and
if
you
ever
start
your
own
business
you
have
your
slogan
right
there
buffy
pauses
looks
thoughtful
and
she
wasn't
crazed
xander
skeptical
yeah
she
devoted
everything
to
making
this
one
person
happy
and
then
it
was
like
with
him
gone
there
was
just
no
reason
for
her
to
exist
any
more
robots
are
the
strangest
people
no
people
are
the
strangest
people
buffy
she
looks
down
as
xander
continues
working
i
mean
look
at
me
obsessing
about
being
with
someone
it's
like
i
don't
need
a
guy
right
now
i
need
me
i
need
to
get
comfortable
being
alone
with
buffy
well
i'll
say
this
she's
a
pretty
cool
person
to
be
alone
with
buffy
smiles
thank
you
xander
turns
back
to
the
window
again
buffy
picks
up
the
piece
of
paper
with
ben's
phone
number
on
it
looks
at
it
bites
her
lip
cut
to
a
moment
later

window
