the
bronze
buffy
willow
and
oz
are
sitting
at
a
bar
nursing
sodas
and
snacks

seems
preoccupied
as
she
idly
plays
with
a
cookie
cordelia
and
xander
walk
behind
them
and
take
a
place
at
the
end
of
the
bar
i
think
we
should
get
a
limo
a
limo
yeah
a
big
expensive
limo
that
sounds
like
fun
and
it
is
our
last
homecoming
dance
so
maybe
we
should
make
a
big
deal
of
it
you
wanna
talk
fun
public
bus
you
meet
the
funnest
people
cordelia
gives
the
others
a
disbelieving
look
back
me
up
here
oz
well
if
it's
a
dollar
issue
we
could
all
take
my
van
van
the
homecoming
queen
doesn't
go
to
the
dance
in
a
van
use
your
head
willow
rolls
her
eyes
xander
to
cordelia
well
technically
you
haven't
been
elected
yet
xander
gets
a
look
from
her

without
a
doubt
will
be
xander
to
the
others

smiles

private

up
to
oz
cuddlesome
willow
looks
toward
buffy
and
if
we
all
split
the
cost
buffy
comes
out
of
her
reverie

a
da

she
hopes
she
hasn't
messed
anything
up
for
buffy
with
scott
standing
right
there
oz
gives
a
little
smirk
behind
her
cordelia
confused

not
ask
her
to
the
homecoming

willow
smiles
widely
oz
smiles
the
judges
will
accept
that
as
a
'yes'
scott
to
buffy
do
you
want
me
to
get
you
another
drink
um
no
actually
uh
ii'm
a
little
tired
i
think
i'm
gonna
call
it
a
night
but
i'm
excited
about
the
dance
buffy
smiles
me
too
buffy
leans
toward
him
tugs
gently
on
his
jacket
and
they
kiss
cut
to
angel's
mansion
cut
inside
there
is
a
fire
going
in
the
fireplace
angel
walks
past
it
and
the
camera
follows
him
he
is
shivering
from
the
cold
he
stops
and
paces
back
he
turns
to
go
back
again
but
is
startled
by
some
rustling
in
the
atrium
slowly
he
walks
to
the
doorway
he
quickly
whips
the
drapes
aside
and
there
he
finds
buffy
holding
a
small
paper
bag
he
jumps
back
a
little
startled
iit's
just
me
buffy
holds
out
the
bag
here
angel
takes
the
bag
and
opens
it
as
he
walks
back
into
the
room
buffy
follows
him
in
but
keeps
her
distance
angel
remains
faced
away
from
her
he
pulls
a
quartsized
clear
plastic
container
out
of
the
bag
it's
filled
with
blood
angel
lifts
it
to
his
nose
and
sniffs
how
are
you
feeling
angel
jerks
his
head
away
slightly
from
the
tub
of
blood
then
lowers
it
to
take
off
the
lid
it
hurts
less
good
she
is
unsure
how
to
continue
she
turns
around
and
takes
a
few
steps
away
before
facing
him
again
i
haven't
told
giles
and
the
others
that
you're
back
angel
quietly
giles
he
remains
faced
away
from
her
and
i'm
not
going
to
they
wouldn't
understand
that
you're
better
aaand
i'm
gonna
keep
helping
you
get
better
it's
just
that
everything's
different
now
i'm
a
senior
i'm
really
working
harder
in
school
buffy
smirks
slightly
i'm
even
thinking
about
college
aand
i'm
involved
with
someone
this
causes
angel
to
turn
around
and
give
her
a
surprised
look
buffy
startles
and
takes
a
step
back
he
reaches
out
and
straightens
the
lapel
of
her
leather
jacket
buffy
takes
it
from
him
and
he
lets
go
he
turns
away
again
wincing
from
his
body
aches
as
he
does
so
his
name
is
scott
he's
a
nice
solid
guy
he
makes
me
happy
and
that's
what
i
need
someone
i
can
count
on
the
camera
suddenly
pans
quickly
to
the
left
blurring
the
picture
and
comes
to
a
stop
on
scott
at
an
outside
hall
at
school
the
next
day
i
don't
think
we
should
see
each
other
anymore
buffy
taken
aback
you
don't
buffy
confused
when
did
this
happen
where
was
i
buffy
it's
just
before
we
were
going
out
you
you
seemed
so
full
of
life
like
a
force
of
nature
now
you
just
seem
distracted
all
the
time
and
buffy
interrupts
yeah
i
know
it's
i'm
getting
better
honest
in
fact
from
here
on
you
are
gonna
see
a
drastic
distraction
reduction
scott
doesn't
react
at
all
to
her
attempt
at
a
joke
'drastic
distraction
reduction'
try
saying
that
ten
times
fast
i'm
really
sorry
he
starts
walking
away
sadly
buffy
just
watches
him
go
as
the
camera
pulls
back
from
her
cut
to
a
view
of
her
through
a
pair
of
binoculars
she
is
still
watching
scott
walk
away
cut
to
a
van
with
darkly
tinted
windows
in
a
parking
lot
the
camera
closes
in
on
it
cut
inside
the
van
the
man
looking
through
the
binoculars
lowers
them
and
stares
intensely
out
of
the
window
behind
him
another
man
steps
around
him
also
looking
out
the
window
the
first
man
raises
the
binoculars
back
to
his
eyes
and
the
second
man
attaches
a
digital
video
feed
to
it
behind
them
the
binocular's
view
of
buffy
appears
on
three
small
screens
the
second
man
reaches
over
to
a
modem
set
up
below
the
monitors
it
is
attached
to
a
cell
phone
which
he
opens
and
he
presses
a
button
to
establish
a
connection
the
speed
dial
sends
the
tones
out
in
a
split
second
cut
to
a
similar
modem
in
a
dark
office
the
tones
and
screeches
of
the
connection
protocol
quickly
establish
a
link
the
camera
pans
up
and
back
until
we
see
an
old
man
in
a
wheelchair
roll
up
to
the
desk
by
the
keyboard
of
the
computer
connected
to
the
modem
he
hits
a
few
keys
and
looks
up
at
the
monitor
is
that
her
trick
steps
into
view
in
the
nubile
flesh
my
friend
the
camera
shows
a
view
of
buffy
on
the
monitor
as
she
walks
slowly
and
sadly
that's
the
target
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part

inside
deputy

allan
finch
is
waiting
nervously
outside

allan
takes
a
deep
breath
to
compose
himself
and
heads
for
the
mayor's
door
cut
inside
the
office
allan
opens
the
door
and
steps
in
holding
a
folder
in
his
hand
he
glances
at
the
mayor's
desk
but
doesn't
see
him
there
he
turns
his
head
and
sees
him
coming
out
of
his
private
washroom
the
mayor's
hands
come
into
the
camera's
view
as
he
vigorously
dries
them
off
i'm
sorry
to
bother
you
sir
allan
closes
the
door
behind
him
i'm
not
bothered
allan
mayor
wilkins
goes
to
his
desk
allan
steps
toward
the
desk
well
ii'm
not
sure
how
serious
this
is
but
uh
allan
opens
the
folder
they
were
spotted
in

three
days
ago
allan
lays
the
open
folder
on
the
desk
i've
just
been

hans
gruenstahler
uh
allan
the
mayor
picks
up
a
copy
of
the
interpol
warrant
wanted
in
germany
for
capital
murder
terrorism
uh
allan
the
mayor
sniffs
the
paper
the
bombing
of
flight
1402
uh
i
should
have
brought
it
to
your
attention
sooner
but
i'd
i'd
wanted

flustered
by
the
mayor's
sniffing
confirm

takes
another
sniff

your

aside
and
indicates
that

allan
holds
out
his
hands
and
slowly
leans
over
placing
them
flat
on
the
desk
the
mayor
leans
closer
to
inspect
them
allan
nervously
watches
the
mayor
who
draws
a
breath
after
looking
them
over
i
think
they
could
be
cleaner
of
course
sir
ii
mean
i
i
washed
them
but
the
mayor
leans
back
in
his
chair
allan
looks
like
he's
about
to
have
a
nervous
breakdown
after
every
meal
and
under
your
fingernails
dirt
gets
trapped
there
and
germs
and
mayonnaise
my
dear
mother
said
'cleanliness
is
next
to
godliness'
and
i
believed
her
she
never
caught
a
cold
mayor
wilkins
laughs

like

wilkins

wilkins

back
up

turns
his
attention
back
on
his
tie

with
it
and
comes
over
to
him

her
hands
along
the
way
to
reach
for
the
tie

lets
go
of
the
tie
and
she
starts
to
tie
it

looks
up
at
him
and
gives
him
a
little
smile

does
your
heart
beat

is
finished
with

outfit

the
tuxedo
jacket
oh

willow
steps
out
from
behind
the
screen
well
since
when
did
you
become
a
you
and
your
letters
are
gone
forever
they
are
both
struck
dumb
when
they
see
each
other
she
is
wearing
an
elegant
black
sleeveless
fulllength
dress
xander
is
looking
dapper
in
his
tuxedo
they
don't
say
anything
for
a
long
moment
willow
finally
breaks
the
silence
to
finish
her
sentence
gentleman
willow
smiles
and
giggles
she
looks
down
at
her
dress
then
back
up
at
him
and
shrugs
uh
i
know
'nice'
xander
i
was
gonna
go
with
'gorgeous'
willow
steps
toward
her
willow
smiles
really
willow
steps
toward
him
you
too
iin
a
guy
way
with
all
the
things
that
you
could
be
xander
lyrics
smiles
back
and
draws
a
breath
oz
is
very
lucky
willow
smiling
so
is
cordelia
iin
a
girl
way
you
never
could
learn
how
to
be
me
suddenly
willow
looks
very
worried
i
don't
know
if
i
can
dance
in
this
i
don't
know
if
i
can
dance
come
on
piece
of
cake
he
steps
up
to
her
and
offers
his
hands
to
dance
here
and
now
you
want
to
ask
me
'how'
they
take
a
few
seconds
to
get
positioned
for
a
traditional
slow
waltz
and
then
start
to
dance
well
that
seems
to
um
he
looks
down
at
their
feet
as
they
sway
back
and
forth
for
a
little
while
willow
looks
up
at
him
but
tries
not
to
look
like
she
is
it's
like
how
does
your
heart
beat
why
do
you
breathe
yeah
this
shouldn't
be
a
problem
how
does
your
heart
beat
no
they
slowly
inch
closer
to
each
other
why
do
you
breathe
no
problem
how
does
your
heart
beat
why
do
you
breathe
he
slowly
leans
his
head
down
to
her
and
she
responds
by
angling
hers
up
to
him
they
are
soon
very
close
and
kiss
gently
the
kiss
goes
on
for
several
seconds
before
they
realize
what
they
are
doing
and
quickly
jump
apart
how
do
you
breathe
xander
points
at
her
that
didn't
just
happen
no
willow
gestures
nervously
i
mean
it
did
but
it
didn't
because
i
respect
you
and
oz
and
i
would
never
willow
furrows
her
brow
i
would
never
either
iit
must
be
the
clothes
iit's
a
fluke
it's
a
clothes
fluke
that's
what
it
is
and
there'll
be
no
more
fluking
not
ever
they
step
closer
again
and
are
about
to
kiss
when
they
jump
apart
again
we
gotta
get
out
of
these
clothes
right
now
they
quickly
realize
the
implication
of
what
they
just
said
and
get
all
flustered
and
gesture
wildly
oh
i
didn't
mean
i
didn't
me
either
she
rushes
back
behind
her
screen
xander
hastens
the
other
way
cut
to
sunnydale
high
the
next
day
a
campaign
is
like
a
war
it's
won
or
lost
in
the
trenches
cut
to
the
library
where
buffy
has
the
large
whiteboard
arrayed
with
pictures
of
cordelia
michelle
and
holly
next
to
each
picture
is
a
thermometer
filled
in
red
up
to
their
perceived
levels
of
popularity
below
each
picture
is
a
list
of
strengths
and
weaknesses
for
each
girl
buffy
walks
past
the
board
pointing
at
each
picture
with
a
pointer
stick
as
she
goes
by
holly
michelle
and
our
real
competition
cordelia
all
have
big
head
starts
buffy
sets
down
the
pointer
speaking
of
big
heads
if
i
had
a
watermelon
as
big
as
cordelia's
i'd
be
rich
she
smiles
at
xander
willow
and
oz
who
are
sitting
on
the
table
fidgeting
nervously
and
looking
as
though
they
are
desperate
to
get
out
of
there
they
don't
react
to
buffy's
joke
at
all
her
smile
fades
waits
for
laugh
she
gives
up
waiting
for
a
response
and
takes
a
few
steps
along
the
board
okay
you're
right
making
fun
of
the
competition
only
makes
me
seem
petty
now
this
is
just
like
any
other
popularity
contest
i've
done
this
before
the
only
difference
being
this
time
i'm
not
actually
popular
although
i'm
not
exactly
unpopular
a
lot
of
people
came
to
my
welcome
home
party
but
they
were
killed
by
zombies
buffy
points
at
her
good
point
okay
buffy
steps
up
to
them
here's
the
plan
willow
i
need
you
to
make
a
database
see
who's
for
us
who's
on
the
fence
and
where
our
real
crisis
areas
are
oz
you
take
the
fringe
musicians
those
not
normally
inclined
to
vote
xander
what
she
notices
cordelia
coming
into
the
library
cordelia
looks
at
them
wondering
what's
going
on
and
crosses
her
arms
uh
cordelia
okay
look
i
know
this
is
a
little
awkward
but
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
we
all
can't
get
along
during
this
campaign
time
buffy
cordelia
shrugs
and
nods
i
mean
we're
almost
friends
and
we
are
all
riding
together
in
the
limo
yeah
great
willow
how's
that
database
coming
willow
looks
down
in
shame
uh
it's
just
about
done
willow
sighs
cordelia
insistently
xander
xander
whips
his
head
around
to
face
her
i
got
your
new
flyers
xander
smiles
thinly
let's
get
cracking
buffy
gives
them
all
a
betrayed
look
xander
slips
off
of
the
table
xander
to
buffy
she's
my
girlfriend
xander
goes
to
cordelia
willow
slides
off
of
the
table
also
and
gestures
and
shrugs
a
lot
when
she
looks
at
buffy
on
her
way
to
join
xander
and
cordelia
it's
just
that
she
needs
it
so
much
more
than
you
do
oz
gets
off
of
the
table
also
and
stops
by
buffy
on
his
way
after
willow
pointing
back
and
forth
between
willow
and
himself
as
willow
goes
so
goes
my
nation
he
goes
over
to
stand
with
the
others
who
are
hanging
their
heads
in
shame
and
embarrassment
behind
cordelia
cordelia
by
contrast
is
standing
proudly
erect
facing
buffy
with
her
arms
crossed
thanks
for
what
you
said
buffy
i
think
we're
getting
along
great
don't
you
buffy
takes
it
silently
with
a
look
of
betrayal
and
abandonment
evident
on
her
face
cordelia
turns
and
heads
out
of
the
library
the
others
each
give
buffy
a
quick
apologetic
glance
and
follow
her
out
giles
walks
into
the
area
as
buffy
goes
to
the
table
to
get
her
bottle
of
apple
juice
seems
like
a
lot
of
fuss
for
one
little
title
well
you
know
it's
no
fun
if
you
don't
try
your
best
buffy
takes
a
drink
as
long
as
fun
is
still
in
the
mix
buffy
smiling
sure
it's
not
like
anyone
takes
it
that
seriously
the
bottle
in
her
hand
suddenly
shatters
under
the
pressure
of
her
grip
buffy
gives
giles
an
innocent
smile
cut
outside
to
the
quad
the
homecoming
queen
campaigning
is
well
under
way
fire
escape
by
fastball
plays
in
the
background
as
the
camera
moves
around
taking
in
various
scenes
of
the
girls
trying
to
get
votes
buffy
talks
to
a
small
group
of
students
while
handing
out
fliers
then
looks
over
her
shoulder
at
cordelia
the
camera
pans
over
to
cordelia
glancing
at
buffy
when
she
notices
buffy
looking
at
her
she
shifts
her
attention
to
her
own
group
of
people
several
of
whom
already
have
her
flyer
well
i
don't
wanna
be
president
the
camera
pans
again
and
the
scene
dissolves
to
trick's
abode
and
jungle
bob
checking
his
rifle
superman
or
clark
kent
he
walks
past
the
gruenstahler
brothers
wrestling
with
each
other
i
don't
wanna
walk
'round
in
their
shoes
the
camera
continues
panning
past
lyle
and
candy
gorch
kissing
on
a
couch
dissolve
back
to
the
quad
at
school
the
camera
pans
across
a
bulletin
board
on
which
holly
michelle
and
cordelia
each
have
a
flyer
posted
'cause
i
don't
know
whose
side
i'm
on
buffy
walks
up
to
the
board
and
posts
her
much
larger
flyer
right
on
top
of
cordelia's
i
don't
know
my
right
from

to
the
gruenstahler's

testing
a

trap
he
sticks
a
mannequin
leg
into
it
and
the
jaws
instantly
snap
shut
shattering
the
leg
cut
to
kulak
he
raises
his
arms
and
snaps
them
down
so
his
forearms
are
extended
out
from
him
horizontally
at
his
waist
i
don't
know
about
you
both
of
kulak's
forearms
split
open
from
elbow
to
wrist
and
a
long
serrated
green
throwing
weapon
pops
out
of
each
arm
and
into
his
hands
he
roars
and
quickly
heaves
them
both
at
a
wall
where
they
both
hit
within
inches
of
each
other
cut
to
the
quad
at
school
again
buffy
comes
down
the
stairs
with
a
bounce
in
her
step
i'll
be
the
rain
falling
on
your
fire
escape
at
the
bottom
she
fakes
dropping
her
stack
of
flyers
scott
sees
them
fall
and
quickly
kneels
down
to
pick
them
up
sorry
here
he
hands
her
the
flyers
and
they
both
stand
back
up
and
i
may
not
be
the
man
you
want
me
to
scott
lyrics
looks
at
the
flyers
i
heard

something
to
pass
the
time
i
can
be
myself
buffy

silly
really
how
'bout
you
i
don't
think
so
for
what

my
vote

you
to
feel
buffy
reconsiders
and
smiles

scott
nods
his
head
back
at
her
and
leaves
i

smiles
to
herself
and
pulls
out
her
campaign
notebook

opens
it
to
a
list
of
names
and
checks
off

come

she
closes
it
notices
another
boy
coming
and
tosses
her
flyers
on

making
like

was
an
accident
the
boy
bends
down
to
pick
them
up
cut
to
a
hall
buffy
is
wearing
a
sunnydale
high
team
jacket
and
talks
to
a
group
of
athletes
also
wearing
team
jackets
they
all
smile
at
her
as
she
makes
small
talk
with
them
'cause
i
don't
know
just
what
i've
found
cut
to
her

about
to

to

boy
when
buffy
comes
up
to
him
and
gives
him
a
huge
chocolate
cupcake
she
gives
him
a
radiant
smile
and
then
smiles
smugly
to
herself
as
she
walks
off
i
don't

my
sky
from

cut
to
her
campaign
notebook
she
checks

buffy
walks
over
to
a
column
to
post
a
flyer
cordelia
comes
up
to
the
two
students
and
smiles
brightly
as
she
hands
them
each
a
basket
full
of
sweets
and
chocolates
i
don't
know
about
you
cordelia
then
holds
open
a
bag
for
them
to
dump
their
cupcakes
into
buffy
watches
as
cordelia
steps
over
to
a
trashcan
and
drops
the
bag
into
it
cordelia
gives
her
a
smug
look
and
smiles
before
walking
off
cut
to
the
halls
willow
looks
at
two
flyers
of
buffy
and
cordelia
posted
next
to
each
other
sighs
and
starts
to
walk
along
the
hall
she
only
gets
a
few
steps
before
she
runs
into
buffy
hey
willow
jumpy

willow
it's
okay
that
you're
helping
cordelia
we're
best
friends
i'm
not
gonna
hold
it
against
you
willow
whining
no
i'm
not
a
friend
i'm
a
rabid
dog
who
should
be
shot
but
there're
forces
at
work
here
dark
incomprehensible
forces
and
i'm
sure
they're
more
important
than
all
we've
been
through
together
or
the
number
of
times
that
i've
saved
your
life
willow
looks
at
her
imploringly
what
do
you
want
fifteen
minutes
alone
on
your
computer
with
cordelia's
database
willow
gives
in
with
a
squeaky
voice
'kay
she
slides
her
backpack
from
her
shoulder
and
sits
at
a
table
by
a
window
buffy
smiles
good
oh
buffy
sits
also
cut
outside
the
window
the
camera
pulls
back
from
it
so
i
spoke
to
the
limo
people
and
we're
all
set
cut
inside
the
gruenstahler's
van
one
of
them
is
looking
at
them
through
binoculars
while
the
other
has
a
parabolic
listening
device
trained
on
them
and
records
their
conversation
they'll
pick
up
faith
then
me
then
swing
by
and
get
you
guys
now
what's
your
database
tell
you
about
my
weaknesses
cut
to
a
hall
jonathon
takes
a
big
bite
out
of
a
chocolate
cupcake
as
he
walks
slowly
along
the
camera
pulls
back
from
him
to
show
buffy
walking
with
him
with
her
arm
around
his
shoulders
you
know
jonathon
i've
always
felt
a
special
bond
between
you
and
me
jonathon
with
his
mouth
full
cordelia
gave
me
six
bucks
jonathon
they
stop
walking
that
buys
a
whole
lotta
cupcakes
jonathon
takes
another
bite
cut
to
another
part
of
the
hall
where
cordelia
is
talking
to
another
group
of
students
are
you
kidding
she
holds
up
her
hand
with
her
fingers
spread
in
the
characteristic
'v'
form
of
the
vulcan
greeting
i've
been
doing
the
vulcan
death
grip
since
i
was
four
she
smiles
at
a
guy
and
pokes
him
in
the
forehead
a
few
times
with
her
spread
fingers
blissfully
unaware
that
she
doesn't
know
the
first
thing
about
the
vulcan
nerve
pinch
not
even
its
proper
name
buffy
walks
up
behind
her
with
her
arms
crossed
so
you
really
are
giving
out
money
huh
cordelia
turns
to
face
her
is
that
any
more
tacky
than
your
faux
'i'm
shy
but
deep'
campaign
posters
yes
this
whole
trying
to
be
like
me
really
isn't
funny
anymore
i
was
never
trying
to
be
like
you
and
when
was
it
funny
i
don't
see
why
your
pathetic
need
to
recapture
your
glory
days
gives
you
the
right
to
splinter
my
vote
buffy
not
believing
what
she's
hearing
how
can
you
think
it's
okay
to
talk
to
people
like
this
do
you
have
parents
yeah
two
of
them
unlike
some
people
buffy
completely
flabbergasted
your
brain
isn't
even
connected
to
your
mouth
is
it
xander
and
willow
walk
up
behind
cordelia
why
don't
you
do
us
both
a
favor
and
stay
out
of
my
way
she
starts
to
walk
past
her
putting
her
hand
on
buffy's
shoulder
to
push
her
out
of
the
way
buffy
grabs
her
hand
and
pulls
it
off
of
her
don't
ever
do
that
again
cordelia
jerks
her
hand
away
you're
sick
you
know
that
xander
takes
cordelia
by
the
arms
from
behind
okay
let's
not
say
something
we'll
uh
regret
later
cordelia
to
buffy
you
crazy
freak
vapid
whore
like
that
he
pulls
cordelia
away
from
buffy
cordelia
incensed
what
did
you
call
me
xander
quickly
leads
her
away
down
the
hall
willow
steps
up
to
buffy
looking
extremely
worried
this
is
just
cut
to
willow's
room
later
that
afternoon
she
paces
behind
xander
the
worst
thing
that's
ever
happened
ever
she
sits
on
her
bed
and
crosses
her
arms
and
legs
looking
down
sadly
xander
sits
down
next
to
her
and
puts
his
arm
around
her
i
know
i
know
it's
just
when
i
look
at
you
now
it's
like
i'm
seeing
you
for
the
first
time
i'm
talking
about
buffy
and
cordelia
xander
yanks
back
his
arm
me
too
willow
sighs
what
are
we
gonna
do
i
mean
we
have
to
do
something
this
is
all
our
fault
how
do
you
get
from
'chick
fight'
to
'our
fault'
willow
flustered
because
we
felt
so
guilty
about
the
fluke
we
overcompensated
helping
cordelia
and
we
spun
the
whole
group
dynamic
out
of
orbit
and
we're
just
a
big
meteor
shower
heading
for
earth
okay
calm
down
let's
just
put
our
heads
together
and
think
of
something
xander
willow
nods
xander
takes
a
breath
okay
one
of
us
here
is
pretty
darn
smart
and
i
am
willow
looks
at
him
expectantly
just
in
hell
ii
mean
ii
thought
being
a
senior
at
last
and
and
having
a
girlfriend
at
last
would
would
be
a
good
thing
now
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
good
thing
he
notices
willow's
gazed
fixed
on
his
mouth
what
sometimes
when
you're
falling
to
pieces
your
mouth
willow
reaches
up
with
her
hand
it
just
does
the
sweetest
thing
willow
smiles
xander
reaches
up
with
his
hand
takes
hers
in
it
and
lowers
their
hands
to
his
knee
he
puts
his
other
hand
over
hers
as
well
what
are
we
gonna
do
we
just
have
to
get
the
two
of
them
communicating
i'm
talking
about
us
they
look
at
each
other
in
silence
cut
to
buffy's
house
that
night
she
is
wearing
a
bright
red
spaghetti
strap
evening
gown
with
matching
shoes
and
purse
she
comes
down
the
steps
from
the
porch
and
walks
over
to
the
limousine
waiting
for
her
in
the
driveway
the
driver
holds
open
the
door
for
her
and
she
gets
in
he
closes
the
door
buffy
looks
next
to
her
and
finds
cordelia
sitting
there
wearing
a
green
satin
dress
with
a
corsage
on
her
wrist
what's
going
on
here
where's
faith
cordelia
hands
her
the
card
she
found
in
the
limo
when
she
was
picked
up
buffy
opens
it
and
reads
dear
cordelia
and
buffy
we
won't
be
riding
to
the
dance
with
you
we
want
you
to
work
out
your
problems
because
our
friendships
are
more
important
than
who
wins
homecoming
queen
your
friends
ps
the
limo
was
not
cheap
work
it
out
she
folds
the
card
closed
and
sets
it
down
well
she
looks
around
and
notices
the
corsage
waiting
for
her
in
a
small
box
between
them
they
bought
us
corsages
i
took
the
orchid
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
okay
the
driver
gets
in
and
starts
the
car
the
camera
is
in
a
closeup
shot
of
his
ear
and
he
puts
an
earpiece
into
it
as
the
camera
pulls
out
to
reveal
that
the
driver
is
one
of
the
gruenstahler
brothers
he
puts
the
car
in
gear
and
drives
off
cut
to
a
lonely
stretch
of
road
in
the
woods
the
limousine
drives
along
at
a
steady
speed
i
don't
see
what
the
big
deal
is
cut
inside
the
limo
i'm
not
making
a
big
deal
you
wanted
the
orchid
you
got
the
orchid
it
goes
with
my
complexion
better
the
driver
pulls
the
limo
to
the
side
of
the
road
it
does
have
that
sallow
tint
she
notices
the
car
stop
finally
we're
here
they
hear
the
driver's
door
slam
and
his
footsteps
as
he
runs
off
buffy
gives
cordelia
a
concerned
look
she
opens
her
door
and
gets
out
of
the
car
cut
outside
cordelia
gets
out
behind
her
and
swings
the
door
shut
they
look
around
surprised
to
find
themselves
in
the
middle
of
the
woods
what
is
this
cordelia
loudly
okay
guys
we've
had
enough
of
your
stupid
little
game
buffy
notices
a
vcr
and
a
monitor
waiting
for
them
on
a
rock
what's
massively
wrong
with
this
picture
they
walk
up
to
it
a
sign
on
the
vcr
says
press

which
buffy
does

on
the
screen

buffy
and
cordelia
stare
at
the
monitor
in
disbelief
what
is
a
slayerfest
you
ask
well
as
in
most
of

smiling
hugely

a
nice

the

fades
to
black
and
the
word

appears
in
red
and
white
cordelia
to
the
woods
around
them
hello

cordelia
points
at
buffy

a
slayer
cordelia
puts
her
hand
to
her
chest

they
hear
a
distant
gunshot
and
an
instant
later
the
monitor
explodes
cordelia
gasps
in
fright
and
the
two
of

begin
to
run

from

blinding
light
and
spirals
to
my
heart

standing
about
three
feet

1m

xander
is
idly
nibbling
on
a
finger
sandwich

sees
xander's

he
goes
off
to

the
buffet

sandwiches
of
his

xander
looks
back
at
the
band
now
too
i
can't
help
it

help
it
cut
to
the
woods
buffy
and
cordelia
jog
through
it
at
a
brisk
pace
buffy
scans
the
forest
around
them
as
they
go
cordelia
just
follows
her
i
have
an
idea
we
talk
to
these
people
we
explain
that
i'm
not
a
slayer
and
they
let
me
go
they
slow
to
a
walk
buffy
ignores
cordelia's
comment
and
keeps
scanning
around
them
cordelia
looks
down
and
sees
that
buffy
is
about
to
step
into
a
bear
trap
look
out
with
her
fast
slayer
reflexes
buffy
instantly
lifts
her
foot
back
up
and
the
trap
snaps
shut
empty
knowing
someone
must
be
near
buffy
grabs
cordelia
and
pulls
her
to
the
ground
as
jungle
bob
takes
aim
with
his
rifle
get
down
he
shoots
and
misses
buffy
grabs
the
sprung
trap
and
hurls
it
at
jungle
bob
it
hits
him
hard
and
he
staggers
back
and
steps
into
another
bear
trap
he
grunts
when
it
snaps
shut
on
his
leg
buffy
hurries
over
to
him
with
cordelia
not
far
behind
she
picks
up
his
rifle
and
points
it
at
him
that's
gotta
smart
jungle
bob
tries
to
pry
open
the
trap
now
i
can
let

out

can
put
a
bullet
in
your
head
how
many
are
there
in
this
little
game
and
what
are
they
packing
he
just
stares
at
her
refusing
to
speak
buffy
pumps
a
fresh
round
into
the
gun's
chamber
this
gives
him
cause
to
think
again

of
her
cut
to
the
bronze

more
behind

around

the
camera
follows
her
over
to

over
to
willow

quick
disgusted
glance

he
holds
out
the
rest
of
his
sandwich
wrapped
in
a
napkin
out
to
xander
who
idly
takes
it
giles
then
heads
out
of
the
bronze
to
go
to
his
library
she
knows
that
she
knows
that
willow
keeps
staring
down
at
the
floor
with
a
big
frown
on
her
face
we
did
one
fine
thing
she
knows
that
side
of
me
xander
yeah

been
gone
for
a
while
they
must
really
be
getting'
into
it
i
can't
help
it
cut
inside
a
rundown
cabin
in
the
woods
buffy
kicks
the
door
in
and
she
and
cordelia
rush
in
buffy
holds
jungle
bob's
rifle
in
one
hand
as
she
pushes
the
door
shut
with
the
other
and
pulls
a
chair
over
to
barricade
it
she
starts
to
go
each
window
to
close
the
shutters
and
draw
the
drapes
over
them
we
should
be
safe
in
here
for
a
while
you
need
to
find
a
weapon
cordelia
panting
with
fright
safe
i'm
not
safe
i'm
gonna
die
buffy
pulls
back
the
drapes
from
another
window
to
close
its
shutters
but
it
comes
loose
in
her
hand
and
falls
to
the
floor
buffy
shrugs
yeah
you
are
if
you
just
stand
there
she
pulls
the
drapes
across
to
at
least
block
the
view
and
goes
on
to
do
the
rest
of
the
windows
cordelia
sobbing
i'm
never
gonna
be
crowned
homecoming
queen
i'm
never
gonna
graduate
from
high
school
i'm
never
gonna
know
if
it's
real
between
me
and
xander
or
if
it's
just
cordelia
sobs
some
temporary
insanity
that
made
me
think
cordelia
sobs
i
loved
him
cordelia
sobs
and
now
i'm
never
gonna
get
the
chance
to
tell
him
buffy
allows
her
attention
to
be
diverted
by
cordelia
for
a
moment
she
sighs
and
goes
over
to
her
yes
you
are
we
are
gonna
get
out
of
here
and
we
are
gonna
head
back
to
the
library
where
giles
and
the
rest
of
the
weapons
live
then
i'm
gonna
take
out
the
rest
of
these
guys
just
in
time
for
you
to
congratulate
me
on
my
sweeping
victory
as
homecoming
queen
buffy
heads
back
to
a
window
i
know
what
you're
up
to
cordelia
buffy
turns
back
to
face
her
you
think
if
you
get
me
mad
enough
i
won't
be
so
scared
and
hey
it's
working
where's
a
damn
weapon
she
looks
around
and
sees
an
end
table
with
drawers
walks
over
to
it
and
starts
searching
for
anything
that
she
can
use
buffy
resumes
her
surveillance
at
the
window
you
really
love
xander
well
he
kinda
grows
on
you
like
a
chia
pet
she
finds
a
spatula
and
takes
it
over
to
buffy
that's
it
just
this
and
a
telephone
a
telephone
and
you
didn't
think
that'd
be
helpful
no
this
is
better
for
she
swings
it
a
few
times
and
realizes
it
probably
won't
be
of
much
use
oh
cordelia
exhales

down
on
a
cot
why

every
time

ends
in
violence
and
terror
buffy
staring
out
a
window
welcome
to
my
life
i
don't

life
buffy

free
to

she
walks
over
to
another
window
and
looks
out
again

to
be
homecoming
queen
buffy
turns
to
face
her
again
and
lowers
the
gun
and
that's
all
i
wanted
too
cordelia
she
sighs
looks
down
at
her
dress
and
heads
back
to
the
other
window
again
i
spent
a
year's
allowance
on
this
dress
buffy
looks
out
again
i
don't
even
get
why
you
care
about
homecoming
when
you're
doing
stuff
like
this
again
buffy
turns
around
to
face
her
because
this
is
all
i
do
this
is
what
my
life
is
buffy
lowers
her
head
and
steps
into
the
room
you
couldn't
understand
buffy
shrugs
i
just
thought
homecoming
queen
buffy
smiles
buffy
cordelia
keeps
respectfully
silent
i
could
pick
up
a
yearbook
someday
and
say
i
was
there
i
went
to
high
school
i
had
friends
and
for
one
moment
i
got
to
live
in
the
world
buffy
smiles
and
there'd
be
proof
proof
that
i
was
chosen
for
something
other
than
this
cordelia
gives
her
an
understanding
look
buffy
raises
the
rifle
in
her
hands
besides
buffy
pumps
the
rifle
i
look
cute
in
a
tiara
cordelia
lets
out
a
little
laugh
then
they
hear
a
growl
outside
of
the
cabin
do
you
hear
suddenly
kulak
comes
crashing
through
a
window
he
immediately
grabs
buffy
and
throws
her
down
onto
an
old
mattress
and
pillow
on
the
floor
making
her
drop
the
rifle
she
rolls
out
of
the
way
as
he
swings
at
her
with
his
green
serrated
blades
and
they
just
slice
into
the
pillow
buffy
rushes
to
the
far
wall
and
takes
down
a
set
of
antlers
to
use
for
defense
kulak
swings
his
blades
at
her
while
cordelia
slaps
him
on
the
back
with
her
spatula
from
behind
buffy
blocks
the
blades
with
the
antlers
and
shoves
the
antlers
aside
kulak
goes
down
with
them
cor
the
gun
kulak
gets
to
his
knees
and
takes
a
wide
swing
at
buffy
cutting
her
slightly
on
the
arm
and
making
her
fall
ooh
cordelia
finds
the
rifle
on
the
floor
and
picks
it
up
kulak
stands
up
and
tries
another
swing
but
buffy
grabs
the
end
of
the
rug
he's
standing
on
and
yanks
it
out
from
under
him
making
him
fall
backward
and

back

has
the
gun
raised
now
and
waves
it
around
looking
for
a
target

gets
back
to
his

kulak
takes
a
lunging
swing
at
buffy
she
avoids
it
and
grabs
the
hanging
lamp
above
her
and
uses
it
to
support
herself
to
deliver
a
solid
midair
roundhouse
kick
to
kulak's
face
he
goes
flying
backward
into
a
desk
against
the
wall

to
get
buffy's
attention
buffy
buffy
looks
over
at
her
and
cordelia
tosses
her
the
rifle
she
aims
it
at
kulak
as
he
gets
up
from
the
floor
he
roars
and
starts
to
come
at
her
buffy
pulls
the
trigger
but
the
chamber
is
still
empty
from
cordelia's
shot
so
the
hammer
just
clicks
on
nothing
buffy
quickly
raises
the
rifle
above
her
head
to
block
kulak's
swing
his
blade
embeds
itself
in
the
rifle's
stock
and

and
cordelia
both
jump
and
crash
through
the
glass
kulak
jumps
also

his

just
bounces
off

and
back
into
the
room
by
the
grenade
he
takes
a
quick
terrified
breath
cut
outside

in
a
huge
fireball

roundhouse
kick
to

face
making
her
stagger
a
bit
she
grabs
buffy
by
the
back
of
the
neck
and
shoves
her
into
a
bookcase
bringing
her
head
down
onto

shelves
and
breaking
several
of
them
as
she
falls
to
the

smiles
at

clever
move
but
buffy
does

impales
her
on

into

taken
aback
by
that
and
considers
his
next
move
cordelia
raises
her
eyebrows
at
him
impatiently
lyle
thinks
better
of
taking
her
on
and
gives
her
a
quick
nod

he
cautiously

his
way
around

buffy
to
cordelia
that

teach

corsage
a
more
thorough
inspection

finds
a
small
transmitter
and
they're
hooked
into

both
look
up
when
they
hear
a
door
slam
out
in
the
halls
cut
to
the
halls
the
gruenstahler
brothers
make
their
way
in
scanning
around
