through

is
quietly
making
her
way
in
stake

hisses
loudly
buffy
freezes
with
fear
and
drops
the
stake
she
slowly
retreats
as
the
master
advances
on
her
when
she
can't
retreat

further

watches
as
the
master
reaches
out
with
his
hand
and
clasps
it
around

neck

the
middle
of
the
night

here
let's
not
forget
the
spiders
well
giles
said
he
was
gonna
look
it
up
giles
maybe
he's
in
the
faculty
room
giles
comes
out
of
the
stacks
and
looks
around
bewildered
hey
giles
wakey

i
was
uh
in
the
stacks
i
got
lost
did
you
find
any
theories
on
spiders
coming
out
of

he
reaches
around
willow's
shoulder
with
his
arm
while
wiggling
his
fingers
big
hairy
crawly
willow
is
startled
she
twists
around
and
hits
xander
xander
to
willow
it's
funny
if
you're
me
giles
mildly
confused
i
couldn't
find
anything
uh
particularly
illuminating
um
i
think
perhaps
you'd
best
have
a
chat
with
wendell
himself
okay
if
he
can
still
talk
she
gives
giles
an
odd
look
they
start
out
of
the
library
giles
looks
back
into
the
stacks
still
confused
cut
outside
wendell
is
sitting
on
a
bench
the
team
approaches
him
hey
wendell
how
are
you
wendell
looks
up
huh
you
okay
good
talking
to
ya
man
he
pats
wendell
on
the
back
and
starts
to
leave
but
buffy
pulls
him
back
do
you

just
thought

might
wanna
talk
about
what
happened
you

yesterday
with
the
spiders
i
don't
know
what
to
say
about
that
there's
nothing
to
say
you
saw
two
hundred
insects

gonzoed
anybody
would
have
they're
not
insects
they're
arachnids
they're
from
the
middle
east
spiders
are
arachnids
they
have
eight
legs
insects

have
six
why
does
everyone
make
that
mistake

this
ever
happened
before
wendell
nods
his
head
'yes'
when
lots
of
times
ew
you

hate
spiders
more
than
i
do
wendell
smiles
and
laughs
i
don't
hate
spiders
i
love
'em

hate
me
cordelia
walks
by
behind
wendell
and
turns
to
buffy

buffy
runs
off
willow

what

platonic
right
xander
chuckles
i
had
the
best
collection
in
the
tricounty
area
browns
and
tarantulas
and
black
widows
then
my
folks
shipped
me
off
to
wilderness
camp
all
my
brother
had
to
do
was
maintain
their
habitats
instead
he
left
their
heat
lamp
on
for
a
week
when
i
came
home
they
were
all
dead
that's
when
the
nightmares
started

nightmares

always
the
same
i'm
sitting
in
the
classroom

asks
me
to

they're
comin'
after

blame
them
after
what
i
did
and
that's
how
it
happens
every
time

everyone

started
screaming
too
cut
to
the
hall
buffy
is
looking
for
her
history
class
cordelia
is
waiting
by
the
door
holding

cut
into
the
classroom
buffy
is
sitting
and
looking
around
at
the
other
students
the
teacher
walks
by
she
looks
over
at
cordelia
who
apparently
isn't
having
any
problems
with
the
test
cordelia
turns
the
page
looks
back
at
buffy
and
goes
back
to
taking
the
test
the
teacher
comes
by
again
and
stops
to
glance
at
buffy's
work
he
continues
apparently
satisfied
buffy
flips
through
the
short
answer
test
all
the
pages
are
still
blank
she
glances
up
at
the
clock
1120
she
looks
at
the
space
for
her
name
well
at
least
i
know
my
name
she
starts
to
write
but
her
pencil
breaks
she
lets
out
an
exasperated
breath
she
grabs
her
sharpener
and
sharpens
her
pencil
she
looks
back
up
at
the
clock
and
it's
now
1210
already
she
stares
at
it
in
disbelief
she
looks
around
at
everyone
the
teacher
is
watching
her
intently
and
tapping
his
pencil
she
looks
back
down
at
her
test
and
the
bell
rings
all
around
her
the
students
get
up
and
begin
turning
their
tests
in
as
she
just
sits
and
watches
billy
appears
at
the
door
and
looks
in

sees
him
there
with
a
sad
look
on
his
face
he
walks
off
down
the
hall

empty
now
and
buffy
is
sitting
at
her
desk
alone
cut
to
the
hall
billy
is
walking
along
and
comes
upon
two
girls
talking
as
they
come
down
the
stairs
well
they
both
got
detention
which
is
completely
unfair
since

disappointed
as
they

gets
out
her
pack
of
smokes
cut
to
a
shot
of
her
from
behind
a
rack

has
her
pack
and
pulls
out
a
cigarette
the
ugly
man
behind
the
rack

lights
up

comes
into
the
weak
light
his
face
is
badly
scarred

on

the
room
they
found
him
a
week
ago
exact
same
mo
as

only
he's
in
worse
shape
if
he
doesn't
wake
up
soon
somebody's
gotta
stop
this
guy
somebody

i'm
takin'
him
down
i'm
not

coming
down
the
hall
to
her
locker
i'm
just
saying
wendell
had
a
dream
and
then
that
exact
thing
happened
which
is
a
fair
wiggins
i
admit
but
do
you
think
that
ties
in
with
laura
i
dunno
maybe
she
dreamed
about
getting
beat
up
we
should
ask
buffy
when
she
gets
back
from
the
hospital
the
punk's
mother
suddenly
appears
in
the
hall
xander
sees
the

mom
please
my
friends

willow
closes
her

to
their

it
could
be
a
coincidence
y'know
wendell
finds
a
spider's
nest
and
we
all
wig
because
he
dreamt
about
spiders
so
it
may
not
be
connected
they
enter
the
classroom
the
students
see
xander
come
in
and
start
to
laugh
if
there
is
a
connection
it
doesn't
sound
like
anything
what
willow
is
confused
and
looks
behind
her
at
xander
his

another
body
aan
astral
body
which
can
travel
through
time
and
space
billy's
in
a
coma

like
sleep
right

manner

i
be
seeing
billy's
asteroid
body
astral
body

ever
think
about
is
yourself

get
in
trouble

embarrass
us
with
all
the
crazy
stunts
you
pull
and
do
i
have
to
go
on
no
please
don't
you're
sullen
and
rude
and
you're
not
nearly
as
bright
as
i
thought
you
were
going
to
be
hey
buffy
let's
be
honest
could
you
stand
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
a
daughter
like
that
why
are
you
saying
all
these
things
buffy
a
tear
rolls
down
her
cheek
because
they're
true
i
think
that's
the
least
we
owe
one
another
she
begins
to
sniff
and
cry
you
know
i
don't
think
it's
very
mature
getting
blubbery
when
i'm
just
trying
to
be
honest
speaking
of
which
i
don't
really
get
anything
out
of
these
weekends
with
you
so
what
do
you
say
we
just
don't
do
them
anymore
she
stares
at
him
in
shock
he
pats
her
on
the
leg
i
sure
thought
you'd
turn
out
differently
he
gets
up
and
leaves
buffy
can't
do
anything
but
watch
him
go
for
a
moment
and
then
look
down
he
walks
past
the
building
and
billy
is
there
looking
at
buffy
she
looks
up
again
and
sees
him
billy
turns
and
leaves
buffy

bad
thing
'bad

with
nudity
it's
a
total
nightmare
willow
realizes

buffy
doesn't
know
this
is
happening
and
given

to
dream
about
it's
imperative
that
we
find
her

doors
into
the

probably
faster
if
we
split
up
to
look
for

running
past

you
seem
to
be
the
only
one
things

getting
worse
in
a
few
hours
reality
will
fold
completely
into
the
realm
of
nightmares

the
only
thing
i
can
think
is
to
try
and

without
buffy

who
knows
where
she
might
have
gone

a
dimensional
rift
to
the
graveyard
across

they
put
a
cemetery
in
across
the
street

through
the
rift
into
the

at
a
gravestone
that
reads
buffy
summers
1981

all
gather
around
the
grave
giles
kneels
next
to
it
i've
failed
in
my
duty
to
protect
you
i
should
have
been
more
c
cautious
taken
more
time
to
train
you
but
you
were
so
gifted
and
the
evil
was
so
great
i'm
sorry
he
lays
his
hand
on
the
fresh
soil
as
he
starts
to
get
up
a
hand
reaches
up
through
the
dirt
and
grabs
his
willow

tears
himself
away
as
buffy
comes
up
through
the
dirt
out
of
the
grave
she
brushes
herself
off

has
turned

a
vampire
i
thought

jumps
on

him
down
and

falls
backwards

her
into
the
