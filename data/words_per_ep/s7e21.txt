with
the
axe
thing
i
took

hope
i

what
kennedy
nervously
we
uhwe
followed
her
and
it
was—
it
didn't
work
out
you
guys
it
was
a
trap
it's
not
her
fault
that
could've
just
as
easily
happened
to
me
buffy
vi
shakes
her
head
so
are
you
are
you

plan
now
or

yeah

i

we
got
punished
cut
to

int
buffy's

day
a
couple
of
the

are
standing
around
the

staring
at
faith
as
giles
and
xander
place
her
on
the

giles
is
taking
her
pulse
buffy
walks
into
the
room
and
seems
shocked
at
the
sight
is
she
breathing
ok
still
unconscious
though
we've
still
got
work
to
do
cut
to
25
int
willow's
room
at
buffy's
house
day
buffy
addresses
willow
and
giles
i
think
it's
maybe
some
kind
of
scythe
the
only
thing
i
know
for
sure
is
it
made
caleb
back
off
in
a
hurry
willow
giggles
so
it's
true
scythe
matters
willow
pushes
giles
playfully
and
ignoring
that
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
this
is
really
quite
ingenious
giles
plays
with
the
weapon
kills
strong
bodies
3
ways
and
you
say
you
sense
something
when
you
hold
it
not
much
but
it's
strong
and
i
knew
it
belonged
to
me
i
just
knew
it
giles
inspecting
the
weapon
in
addition
to
being
ancient
it's
clearly
mystical
yeah
i
figured
that
one
out
when
i
king
arthured
it
out
of
the
stone
so
maybe
it's
like
some
kind
of
traditional
slayer
weapon
i
can't
imagine
how
something
like
this
could
exist
without
my
having
heard
of
it
well
the
good
guys
are
not
traditionally
known
for
their
communication
skills
right
um
giles
sits
on
the
bed
any
chance
that
it
might
be
something
other
than
a
tool
for
killing
things
the
first's
guys
clearly
wanted
it
out
of
that
stone
it's
not
just
a
tool
it's
important
we
need
to
find
out
whatever
we
can
who
made
it
when
why
does
it
have
a
name
buffy
shrugs
i
don't
know
a
credit
report
just
find
out
fast
we'll
start
work
immediately
yeah
don't
worry
buff
we'll
find
out
everything
there

or
its
ability
to
be
milked
the
farmer
takes
it
and

just
bring
you
back
to
life
xander
shrugs
that's
what
i
do
cut
to
28
int
willow's
room
at
buffy's
house
dusk
buffy's
weapon
is
leaning
against
the
bed
willow
and
giles
are
talking
in
willow's
room
as
willow
researches
on
her
laptop
and
giles
flips
through
books
ok
before
the
vineyard
was
just
you
know
a
vineyard
it
was
a
monastery
could've
been
put
there
then
some
creepy
monks
messing
with
powers
they
don't
understand
no
it's
older
than
that
it's
prechristian
giles
scratches
his
head
ok
well
i
found
reference
to
stories
the
monks
used
to
tell
about
something
older
uh
like
some
kind
of
pagan
temple
native
american
no
i
don't
know
ugh
ok
maybe
we're
just
going
about
this
the
wrong
way
willow
her
laptop
screen
shows
a
site
entitled
history
of
the
axe
maybe
we
should
research
the
weapon
itself
likelook
maybe
it's
the
axe
of
dekeron
said
to
have
been
forged
in
hell
itself
lost
since
the
children's
crusade
where
it
was
said
to
have
killed—
willow
sits
back
makes
a
face
oh
children
i
hope
that's
not
it
well
i
have
reference
to
the
sword
of
moskva
the
uhreaper
of
the
tigris—how
are
we
supposed
to
narrow
this
down
the
illustrations
are
never
clear
enough
giles
stands
leans
on
the
window
oh
damn
we're
running
out
of
time
we
really
haven't
got
anything
useful
giles
willow
walks
to
the
weapon
and
picks
it
up
do
you
sense
any
of
the
power
that
buffy
spoke
about
gotta
say
no
must
be
a
slayer
thing
giles
walks
over
to
willow
and
sits
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
tapping
into
magicks
might
help
with
that
maybe
but
i
mean
if
caleb
is
scared
of
this
thing
it
must
be
pretty
dangerous
and
tapping
into
that
willow
puts
the
weapon
down
carefully
willow
you
could
do
it
without
endangering
yourself
willow
apprehensive
if
i
tried
something
big
i'd
change
and
then
it's
all
black
hair
and
veins
and
lightning
bolts
i
can
hardly
do
a
locator
spell
without
getting
dark
roots
giles
softly
and
if
it
was
necessary
honestly
i
don't
know
willow
goes
back
to
her
computer
giles
sighs
all
right
do
what
you
can
that's
all
any
of
us
can
do
i
guess
so
ugh
man
none
of
these
sound
right
willow
scrolls
down
i
mean
look
here's
one
that's
just
m
question
mark
what
the
heck
is
that
giles
stands
let
me
see
giles
walks
to
look
at
the
screen
it's
not
a
question
mark
it's
the
international
phonetics
alphabet
symbol
for
glottal
stop
a
whoey
it's
sort
of
a
gulping
noise
i'mremembering
something
here
um
ah
hieroglyphs
hieroglyphs
stand
for
sets
of
consonants
as
you
know
yes
absolutely
giles
paces
m
plus
glottal
stop
is
represented
by
a
picture
that's
commonly
thought
to
symbolize
a
sickle
or
a
scythe
it's
in
thousands
of
carvings
in
egypt
throughout
the
ancient
world
carvings
like
you'd
have
on
a
pagan
temple
go
back
see
what
else
we
can
find
out
about
this
temple
giles
picks
up
the
weapon
the
scythe
is
a
symbol
of
death
let's
see
where
these
pagans
buried
their
dead

i
have
to
take
a
driving
test
every
year

depth
perception
anymore
that

xander

dawn
rolls
her
eyes
sighs
giles
was
just
having
fun
with
you
that's
not
the
point
it's
an
obvious
joke
it'd
be
like
someone
calling
me
a
cyclops
oh
dawn
giggles
then
stops
clears
throat
ok
so
not
that
funny
i
mean
uh
give
me
some
eye
of
the
beholder
jokes

postmodern

quite
some
time

now
you're
starting
to
sound
like
her
this
is
a
sacred
experience
for
me
and
for
me
as
well
look
when
this
is
all
over
and
our
armies

forth
and
our
will

i
will
be
able
to
enter

buffyfirst

caleb
are
standing
across
from
each
other
facing
each
other
each
holding
out
his
hands
and
leaning
his
head
back
the
first
changes
form
into
the
demonic
apparition—huge
with
two
horns
on
its
head
and
glowy
red
eyes
seen
before
when

lunges
toward
caleb
glowing
and
growling
i
am
thy
humble
servant
the
first's
energy
contracts
into
a
beachball
sized
glowing
light
and
enters
caleb
causing
him
to
wobble
a
little
he
rolls
back
his
head
and
falls
to
the
ground
when
he
sits
up
again
his
eyes
are
black
and
his
voice
is
creepy
and
deeper
and
i
am
ready

cut
to
31
int
buffy's
room
at
buffy's
house
night
faith
is
lying
in
bed
holding
the
scythe
in
front
of
her
buffy's
standing
beside
the
bed
you
feel
it
too
don't
you
damn
and
damn
that's
something
i
know
it's
old
it's
strong
and
it
feels
like
like
it's
mine
faith
places
it
on
the
bed
beside
her
i
guess
that
means
it's
yours
it
belongs
to
the
slayer
buffy
picks
up
the
scythe
slayer
in
charge
which
i'm
guessing
is
you
buffy
sits
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
i
honestly
don't
know
does
it
matter
it
never
mattered
to
me
somebody
has
to
lead
let's
vote
for
chaoahn
it's
harder
to
lead
people
into
a
deathtrap
if
you
don't
speak
english
it
wasn't
your
fault
faith
looks
away
i'm
really
not
looking
for
forgiveness
you're
not
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
i
blew
it
you
didn't
blow
it
tell
that
to—
people
die
you
lead
them
into
battle
they're
gonna
die
it
doesn't
matter
how
ready
you
are
or
how
smart
you
are
war
is
about
death
needless
stupid
death
so
here's
the
laugh
riot
my
whole
life
i've
been
a
loner
that's
the
funny
part
did
i
miss
something
i'm
trying
to—
sorry
sorry
go
no
ties
no
buddies
no
relationships
that
lasted
longer
than
well
robin
lasted
pretty
long
faith
grins
boy's
got
stamina
principal
wood
and
you
and
in
my—
buffy
stands
paces
don't
tell
me
you
two
got
wriggly
no
no
no
no
we're
just
good
friends
or
mortal
enemies
depending
on
which
day
of
the—
was
that
the
funny
part
ok
the
point
me
by
myself
all
the
time
i'm
looking
at
you
everything
you
have
and
i
don't
know
jealous
then
there
i
am
everybody's
looking
to
me
trusting
me
to
lead
them
and
i've
never
felt
so
alone
in
my
entire
life
yeah
buffy
swallows
looks
down
and
that's
you
every
day
isn't
it
i
love
my
friends
i'm
very
grateful
for
them
but
that's
the
price
being
a
slayer
there's
only
supposed
to
be
one
maybe
that's
why
you
and
i
can
never
get
along
we're
not
supposed
to
exist
together
also
you
went
evil
and
were
killing
people
good
point
also
a
factor
faith
nods
but
you're
right
i
mean
i
i
guess
everyone's
alone
but
being
a
slayer
there's
a
burden
we
can't
share
and
no
one
else
can
feel
it
faith
beat
thank
god
we're
hot
chicks
with
superpowers
takes
the
edge
off
comforting
mmhmm
cut
to
32
int
foyer
at
buffy's
house
night
buffy
walks
down
the
stairs
carrying
the
scythe
when
spike
walks
in
the
front
door
honey
you're
home
yeah
spike
sighs
and
you
did
it
fulfilled
your
mission
found
the
holy
grail
or
the
holy
hand
grenade
or
whatever
the
hell
that
is
right
now
we're
going
with
scythe
you
like
well
pointy
and
wooden
is
not
exactly
the
look
i
wanna
know
better
but
it
does
have
flair
can
see
why
a
girl
would
ditch
a
fella
for
one
of
these
i'm
sorry
about
that
buffy
walks
away
cut
to
33
int
kitchen
at
buffy's
house
night
as
buffy
walks
toward
the
kitchen
spike
follows
her
it
doesn't
matter
you're
back
in
the
bosom
all's
forgiven
and
uh
spike
stands
in
front
of
buffy
looking
at
her
last
nightwas
just
a
glitch
a
bit
of
cold
comfort
from
the
cellar
dweller
let's
don't
make
a
thing
out
of
it
spike
breathes
nervously
great
i
have
work
to
do
oh
yeah
another
solo
mission
of
course
yeah
it
is
that's
fine
you
don't
have
to
get
shirty
about
it
i'm
not
shirty
and
what
is
shirty
that's
not
even
a
word
all
right
all
right
big
secret
mission
it's
fine
it's
not
a
secret
well
i
mean
it
is
but
that's
the
point
of
the
mission
find
out
the
secret
this
thing
was
forged
by—
i
don't
even
know
i
mean
something
about
a
tomb
on
unconsecrated
ground
that's
what
i
have
to
do
i
need
to
find
out
what
this
is
and
why
i
have
it
and
that's
the
thing
the
preacher
man
was
so
anxious
to
keep
out
of
your
mitts
that
it
is
well
maybe
i'll
swing
by
the
vineyard
when
you
go
make
sure
he's
sitting
tight
great
ok
spike
turns
to
leave
buffy
walks
after
him
you're
a
dope
i'm
a
what
you're
a
dope
and
a
bonehead
and
you're
shirty
have
you
gone
completely
carrottop
do
you
see
this
buffy
holds
up
the
scythe
this
may
actually
help
me
fight
my
war
this
might
be
the
key
to
everything
and
the
reason
i'm
holding
it
is
because
of
you
because
of
the
strength
that
you
gave
me
last
night
look
i
am
tired
of
defensiveness
and
weird
mixed
signals
you
know
i
have
faith
for
that
let's
just
get
to
the
truth
here
ok
i
don't
know
how
you
felt
about
last
night
but
i
will
not—
spike
breathes
in
looks
away
terrified
of
what
spike
lets
out
a
slow
sigh
last
night
was
spike
looks
up
god
i'm
such
a
jerk
i
can't
do
this
spike
it
was
the
best
night
of
my
life
if
you
poke
fun
at
me
you
bloody
well
better
use
that
'cause
i
couldn't
bear
it
it
may
not
mean
that
much
to
you
but—
i
just
told
you
it
did
spike
sighs
yeahi
hear
you
say
it
but
i've
lived
for
soddin'
ever
buffy
i've
done
everything
done
things
with
you
i
can't
spell
but
i've
never
been
close
to
anyone
least
of
all
you
'til
last
night
all
i
did
was
spike
smiles
hold
you
watch
you
sleep
and
it
was
the
best
night
of
my
life
so
yeah
i'm
terrified

to
be
spike
looks
at
her
were
you
there
with
me
buffy
looks
straight
at
him
i
was
what
does
that
mean
i
don't
know
does
it
have
to
mean
something
no
spike
looks
away
not
right
now
maybe
when
no
spike
throws
up
his
hand
let's
just
leave
it
ok
spike
buffy
sighs
we'll
go
be
heroes
buffy
walks
out
the
door
cut
to
34
int
hospital
supply
room
night
andrew
and
anya
walk
into
the
supply
room
carrying
bags
over
their
shoulders
ooh
this
one
has
oxygen
tanks
they'd
only
be
useful
if
something
big
was
attacking
and
then
we
could
shove
one
down
their
throat
and
blow
'em
up
like
roy
scheider
did
with
that
shark
in
jaws
anya
andrew
stares
at
her
what
you
are
the
perfect
woman
i've
often
thought
so
wanna
rob
let's
rob
andrew
they
walks
to
the
shelves
and
rifle
through
things
oh
cool
gauze
and
alcohol
tape
and
oh
sutures
if
we
want
to
get
stitchy
with
it
oh
and
there's
a
box
of
ointment
here
i
used
one
of
these
on
a
rash
once
oh
show
me
well
it—it's
healed
up
but
it
was
red
and
crusty
with
these
little
itchy
places
show
me
the
box
full
of
ointments
you
little
freak
and
get
cotton
packing
for
the
big
wounds
it's
gonna
be
bad
isn't
it
yeah
andrew
sighs
so
how
come
you're
here
i
mean
you
could
just
go
right
yeah
i
did
once
before
before
what
wellthere
was
this
other
apocalypse
this
one
time
and
well
i
took
off
but
this
time
i
don'ti
don't
know
andrew
sighs
wellwhat's
different
welli
guess
i
waskinda
new
to
bein'
around
humans
before
but
now
i've
seen
a
lot
more
gotten
to
know
people
seen
what
they're
capable
of
and
anya
shrugs
i
guess
i
just
realizedhow
amazingly
screwedup
they
all
are
i
mean
really
really
screwedup
in
a
monumental
fashion
oh
andrew
nods
and
they
have
no
purpose
that
unites
them
so
they
just
drift
around
blundering
through
life
until
they
diewhich
theythey
know
is
coming
yet
every
single
one
of
them
is
surprised
when
it
happens
to
them
they're
incapable
of
thinking
about
what
they
want
beyond
the
moment
they
kill
each
other
which
is
clearly
insane
and
yet
here's
the
thing
when
it's
something
that
really
matters
they
fight
i
mean
they're
lame
morons
for
fighting
but
they
do
they
never
never
quit
so
i
guess
i
will
keep
fighting
too
andrew
sighs
that
was
kind
of
beautiful
andrew
anya
nods
youyou
love
humans
anya
indignant
i
do
not
yes
you
do
you
loooove
them
stop
it
i
don't
love
them
and
i'll
kill
you
if
you
tell
anybody
i
won't
tell
anybody
won't
get
a
chance
to
anyway
i
don't
know
you
might
survive
no

buffy
walks
down
into

lit
inside

dimly
by
torches
giving
it
an
orange
hue
buffy
looks
around
cautiously
a
woman's
voice
comes
from
behind
a
drape
i'd
forgotten
i'd
forgotten
how
young
you
would
be
the
woman
opens
the
drape
and
buffy
sees
a
very
old
woman
with
long
white
hair
standing
before
her
comes
from
the
waiting
mind
plays
tricks
i
see
you've
found
our
weapon
who
are
you
one
of
many
welltime
was
now

alone
in
the
world
so

are
you
some
kind
of
ghost
woman
chuckles
softly
shakes
her
head
nope
i'm
as
real
as
you
are
justwell
let
me
put
it
this
way—
i
look
good
for
my
age
i've
been
waiting
woman
holds
out
her
hands
buffy
hands
over
the
scythe
you
pulled
it
out
of
the
rock
i
was
one
of
those
who
put
it
in
there
what
is
it
woman
admires
the
scythe
a
weapon
a
scythe
forged
in
secrecy
for
one
like
you
who—
i'm
sorry
what's
your
name
buffy
no
really
woman
buffy
shrugs
we
forged
it
in
secrecy
and
kept
it
hidden
from
the
shadow
men
who—
yeah
met
those
guys
didn't
really
care
too
much
for
'em
ahh
yes
then
you
know
and
they
became
the
watchers
and
the
watchers
watched
the
slayers
but
we
were
watching
them
oh
so
you're
like
what
are
you
guardians
women
who
want
to
help
and
protect
you
we
forged
this
centuries
ago
halfway
around
the
world
hence
the
luxor
casino
theme
forged
there
it
was
put
to
use
right
hereto
kill
the
last
pure
demon
that
walked
upon
the
earth
the
rest
were
already
driven
under
and
then
there
were
men
here
and
then
there
were
monks
and
then
there
was
a
town
and
now
there
was
you
and
the
scythe
remained
hidden
i
don't
understand
how
is
it
possible
that
we
didn't
know
any
of
this
we
hid
too
we
had
to
until
now
we're
the
last
surprise
does
this
mean
i
can
win
that
is
really
up
to
you
this
is
a
powerful
weapon
woman
hands
the
scythe
back
to
buffy
yeah
but
you
already
have
weapons
oh
use
it
wisely
and
perhaps
you
can
beat
back
the
rising
dark
one
way
or
another
it
can
only
mean
an
end
is
truly
near
the
woman's
head
cocks
slightly
to
the
side
and
a
cracking
noise
can
be
heard
the
woman
falls
to
the
ground
buffy
looks
up
and
sees
caleb
standing
there
i'm
