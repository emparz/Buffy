fade
in
on
a
graveyard
night
camera
pans
across
the
crypts
and
finds
buffy
crouched
on
top
of
one
she
stands
up
stake
in
hand
looks
around
leaps
to
the
ground
cut
to
buffy
running
through
the
graveyard
pausing
looking
around
a
pair
of
arms
bursts
out
of
a
fresh
grave
but
buffy
stakes
the
vampire
before
it
can
finish
coming
out
of
the
ground
buffy
straightens
up
turns
as
another
vamp
emerges
from
another
grave
she
ducks
his
swing
throws
a
few
punches
kicks
him
in
the
chest
he
does
a
backroll
and
comes
up
to
his
feet
riley
appears
out
of
nowhere
and
throws
the
vamp
aside
riley
riley
smiling
buffy
what
are
you
doing
here
my
job
well
i
just
thought
you
were
in
the
north
sector
watch
out
the
vamp
attacks
riley
from
behind
he
kicks
the
vamp's
legs
out
from
under
him
and
throws
him
aside
the
vamp
hits
a
crypt
and
slides
down
never
mind
riley
punches
the
vampire
then
stakes
him
shot
of
another
vamp
emerging
from
the
ground
buffy
spots
him
and
starts
forward
with
a
yell
raising
her
stake
another
person
appears
from
the
left
side
of
the
screen
and
tackles
the
new
vamp
carrying
him
to
the
ground
buffy
looks
bemused
why
do
i
even
bother
to
show
up
the
two
fighters
get
up
and
we
see
that
the
newcomer
is
spike
he
blocks
a
couple
of
punches
from
the
other
vamp
then
grabs
his
arm
spike
what
are
you
doing
here
same
thing
as
you
and
your
cub
scout
here
i'll
wager
he
lands
a
few
punches
and
the
vamp
goes
down
spike
turns
toward
buffy
with
a
big
grin
a
spot
of
violence
before
bedtime
the
other
vamp
punches
him
in
the
face
and
he
goes
down
he
gets
to
his
knees
wiping
blood
from
his
nose
the
other
vamp
growls
buffy
rushes
forward
shot
of
spike
standing
up
still
wiping
his
nose
with
his
hand
the
other
vamp
attacks
from
the
left
buffy
appears
from
the
right
shoves
spike
out
of
the
way
and
stakes
the
vamp
spike
exhales
loudly
and
buffy
gives
him
a
dirty
look
what
i
softened
him
up
he
wipes
more
blood
from
his
nose
sniffs
it
then
licks
it
from
his
fingers
better
keep
out
of
my
way
spike
i'm
not
gonna
take
this
much
longer
buffy
riley
walks
over
to
join
them
and
i
should
do
what
in
my
spare
time
sit
at
home
knitting
cunning
sweater
sets
would
it
keep
you
out
of
my
way
she's
right
you
shouldn't
be
out
here
when
she's
patrolling
buffy
turns
to
riley
in
exasperation
as
if
she's
going
to
say
something
but
she
doesn't
oh
i
saw
that
looks
like
neither
boy's
entirely
welcome
you
should
take
him
home
slayer
make
him
stay
there
i've
got
knitting
needles
he
can
borrow
riley
looks
annoyed
spike
i
just
saw
you
taste
your
own
nose
blood
you
know
what
buffy
spike
grins
at
her
i'm
too
grossed
out
to
hear
anything
you
have
to
say
go
home
she
stalks
off
riley
gives
spike
a
dirty
look
then
follows
spike
looks
injured
spike
yelling
after
them
it's
blood
it's
what
i
do
cut
to
buffy
walking
along
looking
tired
and
annoyed
riley
catches
up
with
her
hey
hope
i
didn't
get
in
the
way
he
puts
his
arm
around
her
she
gives
a
fake
smile
of
course
not
ii
was
just
startled
and
you
know
i
don't
love
the
idea
of
you
patrolling
alone
not
much
for
benchwarming
no
you
made
the
squad
you
threw
that
vampire
like
he
was
a
teenyweeny
little
vampire
riley
grinning
hey
wanna
go
again
come
on
i
bet
this
place
is
just
teeming
with
aerodynamic
vampires
buffy
looks
around
nah
buffy
pauses
unless
you
wanna
go
back
and
kill
spike
for
the
fun
of
it
riley
raises
his
eyebrows
in
a
sort
of
shrug
they
both
turn
and
continue
on
their
way
cut
back
to
spike
staring
after
them
i
will
know
your
blood
slayer
spike
pause
i
will
make
your
neck
my
chalice
and
drink
deep
he
wipes
blood
from
his
nose
again
turns
and
tries
to
stride
away
purposefully
but
he
falls
into
an
open
grave
long
shot
of
the
graveyard
looking
empty
with
the
open
grave
in
the
foreground
spike
voice
coming
from
the
grave
ow
wolf
howl
opening
credits
act
i

fade
in
on
a
uc
sunnydale
building
filled
with
students
walking
around
talking
studying
etc
you
can't
possibly
be
arguing
that
marat
didn't
betray
the
french
revolutionaries
we
see
willow
and
buffy
walking
through
the
halls
this
was
the
guy
who
declared
the
rights
of
man
and
then
the
next
thing
you
know
he's
killing
girondin
like
it's
going
out
of
style
will
you're
totally
missing
my
point
now
i
agree
that
marat
wasn't
a
real
martyr
but
the
death
in
the
tub
the
neck
wound
all
that
blood
just
a
little
more
fangy
than
knifey
i
mean
charlotte
corday
wasn't
a
real
martyr
either
but
buffy
willow
stops
walking
and
grabs
buffy's
hand
what
willow
smiling
hugely
listen
to
us
wewe're
arguing
we're
having
a
debate
about
a
college
lecture
i
have
dreamt
of
this
day
since
forever
willow
proudly
you
are
turning
into
quite
the
student
willow
buffy
smiles
should
i
be
watching
my
occipital
lobe
your
what
occipital
willow
pointing
to
her
head
the
lobe
in
the
back
of
your
brain
you
know
like
should
i
be
watching
my
back
but
you
know
the
back
of
your
brain
willow
sighs
apparently
not
don't
worry
will
you
still
wear
the
smartypants
in
the
family
i
don't
know
you've
been
studying
really
a
lot
i'm
trying
but
they're
really
piling
on
the
reading
and
giles
fills
any
free
time
i
have
with
extra
training
i'm
starting
to
think
this
working
hard
is
hard
work
isn't
it
crazy
like
that
i
thought
it
was
gonna
be
like
in
the
movies
you
know
inspirational
music
a
montage
me
sharpening
my
pencils
me
reading
writing
falling
asleep
on
a
big
pile
of
books
with
my
glasses
all
crooked
'cause
in
my
montage
i
have
glasses
buffy
willow
nods
but
real
life
is
slow
and
it's
starting
to
hurt
my
occipital
lobe
willow
sympathetic
aw
poor
buffy's
brain
willow
pats
buffy
on
the
head
actually
i'm
heading
to
training
now
do
you
wanna
come
with
i'm
in
willow
they
start
walking
again
maybe
we
can
argue
some
more
about
the
french
revolution
hey
wasn't
that
robespierre
the
coolest
robespierre
you're
kidding
me
right
i'm
just
gettin'
it
goin'
cut
to
a
shot
of
a
circle
saw
cutting
some
wood
we
hear
giles'
voice
indistinctly
over
the
saw
noise
the
camera
pulls
back
and
we
see
it's
xander
wielding
the
saw
wearing
safety
goggles
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
magic
shop
giles
is
behind
the
counter
wearing
a
dustmask
painting
something
giles
muffled
by
the
noise
it
seems
the
plans
worked
perfectly
xander
stops
the
saw
and
unclamps
the
piece
of
wood
from
the
vise
yes
blueprints
not
a
bad
idea
that
and
getting
straight
measure
twice
cut
once
you
know
for
the
longest
time
i
had
it
backwards
messy
xander
begins
fitting
the
piece
of
wood
into
a
bookcase
that
he's
working
on
giles
pulling
mask
down
from
his
mouth
so
it
hangs
around
his
neck
well
i
must
say
i'm
very
impressed
yeah
carpentry
is
pretty
cool
knock
on
the
door
giles
goes
to
answer
it
as
he
walks
across
the
shop
and
the
camera
follows
him
we
see
tara
standing
by
a
small
round
table
wearing
a
long
skirt
holding
a
deck
of
tarot
cards
then
we
see
anya
moving
stuff
around
on
the
shelves
oh
who
put
the
monkey
heads
near
the
styx
water
do
we
want
to
pick
exploded
monkey
out
of
our
hair
anya
picks
up
a
jar
and
a
monkey
head
and
walks
across
the
room
giles
opens
the
door
willow
and
buffy
stand
there
smiling
trick
or
treat
hello
you
two
come
on
in
thank
you
kind
proprietor
they
enter
hey
you
hey
willow
looking
around
oh
wow
this
place
looks
great
oh
i
feel
like
a
witch
in
a
magic
shop
willow
picks
up
a
jar
from
a
table
ooh
are
these
real
newt
eyes
willow
looks
at
giles
no
too
rich
for
my
blood
i'm
afraid
no
these
are
salamander
eyes
it's
the
cataracts
which
give
them
their
newtlike
appearance
giles
moving
past
her
they're
really
equally
effective
though
it's
just
a
matter
of
overcoming
snobberies
we
see
buffy
putting
her
purse
down
and
xander
looking
at
a
blueprint
holding
a
pencil
i'm
telling
you
giles
you
gotta
set
up
a
blind
taste
test
and
prove
once
and
for
all
that
generic
amphibian
eyeballs
are
just
as
good
i
don't
know
if
you
ask
me
the
newt
name
still
means
something
willow
puts
down
jar
and
walks
off
giles
to
buffy
you
ready
to
train
you
betcha
shall
we
then
we
shall
then
they
walk
off
toward
the
back
we
see
willow
sitting
at
the
round
table
with
tara
standing
beside
her
a
lot
of
tarot
cards
on
the
table
i
just
keep
thinking
how
cool
it
would
be
if
we
got
a
real
psychic
to
sit
up
here
and
read
fortunes
and
stuff
you
should
do
it
not
me
but
but
i'd
love
to
to
watch
and
learn
from
someone
who's
really
good
you
know
you're
really
good
willow
holds
out
her
hands
i'll
prove
it
here
do
me
tara
nods
and
sits
putting
down
the
cards
taking
one
of
willow's
hands
willow
watches
her
study
it
hmm
what
do
you
see
willow
hand
they
both
smile
cut
to
giles
opening
the
door
to
the
back
as
buffy
and
xander
watch
giles
holds
the
door
for
buffy
shot
of
buffy
entering
looking
around
someone
tackles
her
from
the
side
pulling
her
out
of
the
shot
so
we
see
giles
and
xander
behind
looking
surprised
buffy
falls
to
the
floor
on
top
of
riley
who
has
his
arms
around
her
waist
unh
ow
riley
they
get
up
just
keeping
you
on
your
toes
or
off
them
as
it
were
what's

into
she
stops
as
she
looks
around
the
room
and
sees
it
for
the
first
time
oh
my
god

at
this
place
long
shot
of
the
room
we
see
a
punching
bag
hanging
from
the
ceiling
a
vault
horse
atop
a
set
of
mays
a
stationary
bike
and
a
scarecrowdummy
in
the
background

something
that
looks
like
a
minifridge
against
the
far
wall

a
set
of
weights
symbols
are
painted
on
the
floor
and
walls
buffy
gasps

giles
removing
his
glasses
and
then
the
mask

still
around
his
neck

a
start

a
proper
space
to
train
so

giles
gives
a
small
smile
riley
grinning

riley
throws
a
few
fake
punches
at
buffy
she
mostly
ignores
him
walking
farther
into
the
room
what's
the
matter
afraid
of
a
little
competition
it
must
have
been
so
much
work

xander
nods
i'm

go
change
cut
to
the
graveyard
night
the
camera
pans
jerkily
across
gravestones
and
bushes
we
hear
the
sound
of
someone
panting
the
camera
moves
up
the
stairs
leading
into
a
crypt
cut
to
spike
sitting
in
his
crypt
watching
tv
oh
pacey
you
blind
idiot
can't
you
see
she
doesn't
love

suddenly
there's
a
banging
on
the
door
spike
jumps
up
and
turns
off
the
tv
more
banging
and
harmony
comes
in
looking
disheveled
and
nervous
she
shuts
the
door
behind
her
and
presses
her
back
against
the
wall
well
well
well
lookie

harmony
anxiously

buffy
gotten
to

with
a
stake
harmony
spike
pretends
to
look
shocked
she
won't
give
up
until
she's
killed
me
to
death
spike
skeptical
buffy's
looking
for
you
of

harmony
walks
forward

why
i'm
on
the
lam

looks
anxiously
at

harmony
shrugs
casually
like

spike
grins
to
himself
as
harmony
sits
in
his
chair
and
takes
out
a
cigarette
she
begins
flicking
a
lighter
trying
to
light
it
she
flicks
it
quite
a
few
times
before
she
finally
figures
it
out
and
gets
the
cigarette
lit
taking
up
smoking

leans
back
in
the
chair
i
am
a
villain

takes
a
drag
and
starts
to
cough
i
guess
you
are
at
that
what
with
the
slayer
on
your
tail
and
all
harmony
watches
him
warily
she's
not
the
type
to
give
up
either
she'll
hunt
you
down
day
and
night
till
you're
too
tired
and
too
hungry
to
run
any
more
and
then
spike
leans
down
to
grab
a
handful
of
dust
then
spike
dusting
off
his
hands
that
is

harmony
looks
upset
i

to
kill
her
harmony
whining

tried

all
hard
and

harmony
sits
up

do

i
can't
remember
i've
got
this
cute
little
government
chip
in
my
head

sighs

to
be

harmony
looks
up
at
spike
again

help
with
the
thinking
spike
nods
yeah

suppose

could
do

harmony
smiles
and
sits
back
again
putting
the
cigarette
to
her
lips
cut
to
buffy
and
riley
lying
in
bed
sidebyside
riley
is
tapping
his
hands
agitatedly
on
his
chest
buffy
gives
a
contented
sigh

riley
continues
patting
himself

over
at
her

more
riley
turns
onto
his
side
and
snuggles
up
against
her

riley
is
kissing
her
bare
shoulder

behind
her
to
caress
his
cheek

the
endurance
of
ten
men
let's
make

riley
buffy
laughs
just
for
the
imagery

takes
a
lot
to
wear
me
out
buffy
turns
toward
him
oh

love
a
challenge
mm
buffy
turns
back
onto
her
back
and
riley
moves
on

of
her

kitchen
pouring
from

sugar
bombs
cereal
there
are
a
number
of
bowls
on
the
table
in
front
of
her
every
kid
tries
to
make
the
substitute
cry
it's
like
a
rite
of
passage
we
see
joyce
in
the
background
cooking
over
the
stove
i
certainly
would
not
being
a
substitute
is
an
extremely
difficult
job
besides
joyce
looks
at
the
bowls
honestly
dawn
how
many
bowls
of
cereal
are
you
planning
on
eating
oh
these
aren't
for
eating
i'm
just
trying
to
get
the
extra
out
of
the
way
so
i
could
dawn
sticks
her
hand
in
cereal
box
pulls
out
a
toy
get
this
dawn
she
smiles
cheerfully
at
joyce
and
sits
down
anyway
dawn
pointing
to
joyce
i
want
eggs
you
want
the
cereal
prize
but
you
don't
want
the
cereal
you
are
growing
up
all
righty
half
an
omelette
coming
up
joyce
scooping
the
eggs
onto
two
plates
oh
um
with
ketchup
if
you
please
mmhmm
joyce
turns
away
from
the
stove
holding
the
two
plates
suddenly
she
stops
and
blinks
as
if
dizzy
dawn
looks
up
from
unwrapping
the
prize
joyce
confused
oh
what
is
the
joyce
looks
at
dawn
who
are
you
dawn
looks
confused
suddenly
joyce
collapses
to
the
floor
the
plates
shattering
dawn
jumps
up
in
alarm
shot
of
joyce
lying
unconscious
on
the
floor
surrounded
by
pieces
of
plates
and
food
dawn
backs
away
panting
fearfully
and
grabs
the
telephone
she
dials
911
cut
to
a
hospital
emergency
room
double
doors
burst
open
and
buffy
pushes
in
past
some
people
followed
by
riley
long
shot
down
the
hospital
hall
we
see
dawn
sitting
on
a
chair
fiddling
with
a
stethoscope
that's
hung
around
her
neck
buffy
rushes
up
to
her
hey
how's
mom
are
you
okay
buffy
hugs
dawn
i'm
okay
and
your
mom's
doing
just
fine
a
young
man
in
a
white
coat
approaches
buffy
lets
go
of
dawn
and
stands
up
dawn
still
sitting
this
is
ben
he
gave
me
his
stethoscope
lent
you
his
stethoscope
buffy
right
ben
holds
out
hand
i'm
ben
i'm
an
intern
here
i've
had
the
pleasure
of
hanging
out
with
the
renowned
dr
dawn
here
while
your
mom's
being
tested
ben
buffy
shakes
his
hand
so
what's
goin'
on
what
happened
well
she's
doing
okay
now
the
doctors
don't
really
know
what
caused
the
collapse
we
see
dawn
putting
the
stethoscope
earpieces
in
her
ears
and
tapping
the
end
with
her
fingers
the
voices
fade
out
we
can
still
hear
them
but
they're
muffled
as
they
would
sound
to
dawn
with
the
stethoscope
in
her
ears
ben
muffled
it
could've
just
been
a
dizzy
spell
low
blood
sugar
that
sort
of
thing
but
it's
nothing
bad
i
i
mean
it's
not
serious
right
ben
muffled
very
unlikely
so
your
mom
doesn't
have
a
history
of
fainting
we
see
dawn
putting
the
stethoscope
to
ben's
chest
we
hear
a
normal
heartbeat
buffy
muffled
no
i
mean
not
that
i
know
of
she's
usually
really
healthy
ben
muffled
well
i
think
they'll
be
running
tests
for
a
few
more
hours
we
see
dawn
putting
the
stethoscope
to
buffy's
chest
we
hear
a
normal
heartbeat
ben
muffled
then
they'll
probably
want
her
to
come
back
for
some
followup
tests
in
a
couple
weeks
but
it
really
doesn't
look
like
anything
too
serious
oh
thank
god
i
was
freaking
out
we
see
dawn
getting
up
and
walking
around
them
ben
muffled
i
think
you'll
be
able
to
take
her
home
before
too
long
riley
muffled
well
that
is
definitely
good
news
we
see
dawn
putting
the
stethoscope
to
riley's
chest
we
hear
a
heartbeat
that
is
much
too
fast
and
irregular
dawn's
eyes
widen
and
she
looks
up
at
riley's
face
blackout
act
ii

fade
in
on
a
hospital
exam
room
riley
sits
on
the
exam
table
buttoning
up
his
shirt
i
know
i'm
repeating
myself
here
but
i
don't
know
what
else
to
say
to
convince
you
we
see
buffy
watching
as
a
female
doctor
talks
to
riley
the
doctor
is
writing
on
her
clipboard
i
have
never
in
all
my
years
of
medicine
let
a
patient
with
tachycardia
this
severe
leave
a
hospital
you
said
you
couldn't
keep
me
legally
no
i
can't
force
you
to
do
a
thing
doctor
riley
nods
and
resumes
buttoning
his
shirt
but
with
that
pulse
believe
me
i'd
get
on
my
knees
and
beg
you
if
i
thought
i
could
change
your
mind
you
can't
i'm
going
home
and
your
friend
here
can't
convince
you
to
riley
holds
up
a
hand
to
stop
her
i'm
going
buffy
looks
very
concerned
all
right
then
but
you're
leaving
against
my
recommendation
the
doctor
leaves
riley
looks
at
buffy
then
stands
up
what's
going
on
what
are
you
doing
what
if
you
have
a
heart
attack
riley
puts
hands
on
her
shoulders
listen
to
me
calm
down
me
calm
down
i'm
not
the
one
with
a
pulse
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
my
heart's
different
than
yours
buffy
it
works
differently
now
but
it's
okay
but
you're
still
a
human
riley
you
could
still
have
a
heart
attack
i'm
a
human
who
was
used
as
a
lab
rat
for
months
they
look
up
as
the
door
opens
joyce
and
dawn
enter
hi
hey
how
are
you
buffy
hurries
over
to
hug
joyce
oh
embarrassed
mostly
i'm
sorry
to
put
you
through
this
but
no
more
tests
so
you
can
take
this
pincushion
home
yes
riley
comes
forward
let's
uh
get
outta
here
he
holds
the
door
for
joyce
and
dawn
buffy
gives
him
a
concerned
look
then
exits
also
riley
follows
cut
to
joyce's
living
room
joyce
is
lying
on
the
sofa
sipping
from
a
mug
with
buffy
and
dawn
sitting
by
her
willow
stands
beside
the
sofa
what
about
a
crossword
some
people
say
feed
a
cold
i
say
puzzle
it
oh
no
thanks
willow
i
like
chicken
fingers
with
mustard
when
i'm
sick
joyce
puts
mug
on
coffee
table
i
know
you
do
sweetie
i
can
make
us
some
later
oh
uhuh
you
are
sitting
right
here
on
this
couch
today
i
feel
silly
lying
here
like
a
lump
you
could
make
a
game
out
of
it
aa
very
quiet
game
about
being
a
lump
i
feel
fine
honestly
i'm
more
concerned
about
riley
than
i
am
about
me
you
shouldn't
even
be
thinking
about
that
he's
not
worried
so
i
don't
think
we
should
be
cut
to
buffy's
room
buffy
is
pacing
willow
lies
on
the
bed
while
dawn
sits
on
the
floor
leaning
against
the
bed
i
don't
get
what
he's
thinking
buffy
steps
over
dawn
as
she
paces
around
the
bed
why
isn't
he
worried
maybe
he
thinks
his
body
can
handle
it
he
is
in
really
good
shape
nobody's
body
can
handle
a
heart
attack
buffy
steps
over
dawn
to
pace
the
other
way
again
i
know
i'm
sorry
buffy
i'm
trying
too
hard
to
make
it
okay
buffy
sighs
i
just
keep
coming
back
to
the
initiative
dawn
watches
her
pace
back
and
forth
it
does
have
that
icky
government
feel
to
it
did
you
know
that
one
time
the
cia
tried
to
kill
fidel
castro
with
poisonous
aspirin
dawn
please
dawn
looks
annoyed
buffy
sits
on
a
chair
i
know
i
have
to
do
something
i
just
don't
know
what
another
time
the
cia
dawn
it's
important
buffy
looks
annoyed
but
nods
dawn
quickly
tried
to
make
castro
go
crazy
by
putting
itching
powder
in
his
beard
dawn
buffy
raises
her
eyebrows
accusingly
it's
about
the
government
call
the
initiative
if
they
know
what's
wrong
with
him
they
have
to
help
yeah
but
call
them
how
first
of
all
they
don't
exist
any
more
and
secondly
they
never
claimed
to
exist
in
the
first
place
willow
looks
defeated
buffy
getting
up
it's
so
unfair
i
mean
iit's
like
big
brother
can
spy
on
you
all
the
time
andand
the
second
i
have
something
to
say
no
one
will
listen
dawn
muttering
sounds
more
like
big
sister
there
has
to
be
a
way
like
what
take
a
tour
of
the
white
house
and
pretend
to
get
lost
and
look
for
some
door
with
a
sign
on
it
that
says
secret
government
monster
hunters
if
they're
really
spying
on
you
all
the
time
you
just
say
something
so
you
know
they'll
hear
you
dawn
buffy
looks
thoughtful
like
sometimes
i
write
fake
things
in
my
diary
in
case
dawn
trails
off
i
gotta
go
uh
see
you
guys
later
she
grabs
her
bag
and
leaves
dawn
looks
over
at
willow
what'd
i
say
cut
to
buffy
entering
riley's
room
we
see
a
punching
bag
in
the
foreground
it's
dark
riley
no
one's
there
buffy
walks
in
closing
the
door
behind
her
she
picks
up
the
phone
and
puts
it
to
her
ear
we
hear
a
dial
tone
alternating
with
clicking
noises
buffy
into
phone
riley's
in
trouble
he
needs
help
she
hangs
up
fast
music
starts
cut
to
riley
playing
basketball
with
a
bunch
of
other
guys
they're
all
yelling
the
camera
moves
very
fast
as
do
the
men
giving
it
all
a
dizzy
frantic
feeling
riley
is
clearly
playing
very
well
the
other
men
shake
their
heads
as
the
game
ends
no
way
man
i'm
out
he
throws
the
ball
to
one
of
them
he's
very
sweaty
he
turns
and
walks
off
riley
walks
past
a
bench
where
a
guy
is
sitting
he
glances
at
the
guy
then
away
graham
riley
keeps
walking
riley
graham
we
see
graham
sitting
on
the
bench
talking
over

convincing
makes
me
completely

government
control
graham
stares
riley
down
with
the
two
other
agents
behind
him
riley
puts
out
his
hands
in
fists
with
the
wrists
together
as
if
inviting
handcuffs

take
me
where
they
can

tellin'
you

now
graham
riley
nods
i'm
not
givin'
you
a
choice
i
guess
you're
not
suddenly
he
punches
graham
in
the
face
the
other
two
agents
grab
both
riley's
arms
but
he
throws
one
of
them
off
knees
the
other
one
in
the
stomach
and
punches
him
he
blocks
a
kick
from
the
first
one
punches
him
clotheslines
him
throws
the
other
one
to
the
ground
and
runs
off
cut
to
interior
of
uc
sunnydale
building
we
see
buffy
talking
to
graham
amid
a
crowd
of
students
graham's
face
is
bruised
so
you
messed
up
and
now
he's
gone
and
when
are
you
even
gonna
tell
me
what's
wrong
with
him
i'm
not
permitted
to
say
say
graham
sighs
hyperadrenal
overload
and
a
bunch
of
stuff
that
sounds
even
worse
than
that
and
all
it
means
is
he's
way
stronger
than
he
oughta
be
and
feeling
no
pain
his
heart
can't
take
it
we've
been
at
him
for
weeks
about
it
buffy
sighs
there's
a
specialist
waiting
at
sunnydale
general
fourth
floor
neurology
get
riley
there
if
you
don't
i'll
get
him

graham
nods

to
walk
off
graham
watches
her
go
buffy
she
turns
back
if
you
tell
me
to
hurry
i'll
kick
your
ass
she
walks
off
as
graham
watches
cut
to
shot
of
sunnydale
evening
fade
to
riley
walking
through
woods
approaching
the
entrance
to
a
cave
and
entering
it
cut
to
interior
of
the
magic
shop
we
see
willow
and
tara
sitting
at
the
round
table
with
giles
standing
in
the
background
poor
riley
could
he
have
simply
gone
back
to
his
apartment
giles
walks
toward
them
and
we
see
buffy
standing
beside
the
table
xander
and
anya
are
sitting
across
from
willow
and
tara
no
he's
not
at
his
apartment
he's
not
at
the
gym
he's
not
at
the
library
he's
gone
somewhere
where
he
doesn't
wanna
be
found
so
basically
he's
gone
awol
basically
exactly
poor
buffy
maybe
he
just
needs
some
time
alone
like
i
had
this
friend
once
who
really
liked
this
girl
and
he
got
all
worried
that
maybe
she
didn't
like
him
back
xander
buffy
and
giles
look
confused
and
maybe
that
made
him
act
like
a
total
jerk
maybe
riley
reminds
me
of
that
friend
anya
smiles
what
are
you
talking
about
then
again
maybe
not
maybe
he
just
wants
attention
well
here's
a
hot
tip
if
you
want
attention
be
there
so
people
can
give
it
to
you
anya
softly
i
care
about
you
xander
xander
smiles
confusedly
thanks
anya
smiles
don't
be
insecure
xander
shrugs
shakes
his
head
thanks
i
won't
and
i
also
have
this
friend
anya
making
airquotes
and
uh
i
have
it
on
really
good
authority
that
she
really
likes
that
guy
your
friend
anya
airquotes
and
by
the
by
my
friend
you
guys
enough
buffy
anya
and
xander
look
embarrassed
okay
riley
is
in
real
danger
here
buffy
sighs
anya
xander
why
don't
you
guys
check
the
docks
anya
and
xander
nod
aye
aye
they
get
up
and
leave
tara
and
i
can
scope
out
the
burnedout
school
riley
hid
there
once
maybe
he
feels
it's
homey
or
something
buffy
thoughtful
homey
you
know
what
else
he
might
find
homey
in
a
dank
unpleasant
evil
sort
of
way
buffy
giles
sits
in
xander's
vacated
seat
the
initiative
caves
i
don't
know
them
too
well
giles
sipping
tea
we
do
have
an
associate
who
knows
those
caves
like
the
back
of
his
melanindeprived
hand
buffy
sighs
i
so
don't
want
to
deal
with
spike
right
now
that
guy
is
really
starting
to
bug
me
in
that
special
i
wanna
shove
something
wooden
through
his
heart
kinda
way
he
does
seem
extra
twitchy
lately
maybe
the
whole
not
killing
is
gettin'
to
him
plus
hanging
out
all
day
in
that
moldy
crypt
you
just
know
he's
doing
something
nasty
cut
to
spike
sitting
with
harmony
in
the
crypt
okay
is
it
bigger
than
a
breadbox
harmony
smiling
no
four
left
so
it's
smaller
than
a
breadbox
harmony
giggling
no
only
three
spike
quietly
annoyed
harmony
is
it
a
sodding
breadbox
harmony
clapping
and
laughing
yes
oh
my
god
someone's
blondie
bear
is
a
twentyquestion
genius
banging
on
the
door
harmony
stops
laughing
and
looks
scared
she's
found
me
she
jumps
up
and
runs
over
to
a
coffin
climbs
into
it
spike
follows
and
slides
the
lid
onto
the
coffin
then
sits
on
top
of
it
trying
to
look
casual
buffy
busts
the
door
open
and
strides
in
i've
got
a
proposition
for
you
spike
jumping
off
the
coffin
funny
i've
got
a
proposition
for
you
what
about
knocking
spike
buffy
ignores
him
pulling
out
a
wad
of
cash
and
unfolding
it
seems
only
fair
since
we
vamps
can't
enter
your
flat
without
an
invite
you
could
at
least
say
look
at
those
pretty
pieces
of
paper
riley's
sick
with
some
initiative
thing
and
he's
missing
i
think
he
might
be
in
the
caves
you
find
him
bring
him
to
the
fourth
floor
of
the
hospital
their
doctors
get
to
him
in
time
buffy
holds
up
the
money
you
get
the
cash
oh
dear
is
the
enormous
hall
monitor
sick
tell
me
is
he
gonna
die
buffy
slaps
him
across
the
face
he
is
not
the
only
person
that
can
die
hey
i'm
just
saying
if
it's
really
that
important
to
you
i
think
i'll
get
half
now
buffy
looks
at
the
money
in
her
hand
she
rips
the
bills
in
half
slams
one
half
against
spike's
chest
and
strides
out
spike
watches
her
go
then
looks
down
at
the
halfbills
in
his
hand
harmony
pushes
the
coffin
lid
aside
and
peeks
out
so
what'd
she
say
about
me
cut
to
hospital
corridor
the
doubledoors
open
and
graham
walks
through
walks
down
the
hallway
past
a
security
guard
who
nods
at
him
graham
goes
through
another
set
of
doubledoors
and
enters
a
lab
the
doctor
dr
overheiser
is
there
any
word
they'll
be
here
any
minute
overheiser
looks
at
a
folder
in
his
hand
that's
soon
enough
right
i
mean
if
we
bring
him
in
now
i'll
be
honest
i'm
not
sure
it's
soon
enough
if
you
brought
him
in
yesterday
knock
on
the
door
graham
turns
finally
he
opens
the
door
to
see
the
security
guard
apparently
standing
there
then
the
guard
falls
forward
his
head
hitting
graham's
graham
falls
back
and
the
guard
falls
on
top
of
him
as
we
see
harmony
walking
in
behind
the
dead
guard
overheiser
looks
up
in
alarm
spike
follows
harmony
in
carrying
a
crossbow
he
tosses
it
to
harmony
who
catches
it
and
points
it
at
the
doctor
letting
the
tip
of
the
arrow
touch
his
cheek
you
got
yourself
a
new
patient
doc
blackout
act
iii

fade
in
on
buffy
walking
in
the
woods
holding
a
flashlight
it's
dark
she
finds
the
cave
entrance
that
riley
used
earlier
and
walks
in
exterior
shot
of
a
college
building
cut
to
interior
of
a
room
with
several
tiers
of
chairs
the
door
opens
and
spike
enters
followed
by
overheiser
and
then
harmony
with
the
crossbow
look
you
don't
understand
this
is
a
complicated
neurological
procedure
and
i've
never
performed
it
before
they
walk
down
the
steps
past
rows
of
seats
into
a
surgical
theatre
little
performance
anxiety
eh
doc
spike
takes
off
his
jacket
sits
on
the
operating
table
butterflies
in
the
old
belly
harm
do
us
a
favor
shoot
the
nasty
butterflies
for
the
good
doctor
spike
overheiser
looks
from
harmony
to
spike
and
moves
toward
the
operating
table
there
you
go
it's
not
so
complicated
just
do
whatever
those
initiative
lab
monkeys
did
only
backwards
harmony
sits
on
a
nearby
counter
this
is
a
medical
school
not
a
proper
operating
facility
these
instruments
overheiser
gesturing
at
the
tray
of
instruments
spike
sighs
they
look
pointy
enough
they'll
do
he
lies
back
on
the
table
with
his
hands
behind
his
head
you're
not
listening
that
chip
is
deeply
imbedded
in
your
cerebral
cortex
removing
it
could
leave
you
a
vegetable
that's
not
gonna
happen
mate
see
i
have
faith
in
your
survival
instinct
he
looks
significantly
over
at
harmony
overheiser
looks
too
harmony
smiles
and
lifts
the
crossbow
spike
smiling
yeah
you'll
have
me
up
and
killing
before
the
night's
over
spike
note
although
it
sounds
like
killing
and
the
closedcaptions
say
killing
his
lips
clearly
say
fighting
overheiser
looks
apprehensive
spike
continues
to
grin
come
on
doc
spike
nudges
the
doctor
with
his
foot
you'll
do
me
right
nothing
bad'll
happen
to
you
suddenly
an
arrow
flies
across
the
room
narrowly
missing
the
doctor
and
lodging
in
the
wall
opposite
spike
and
overheiser
look
at
it
startled
then
look
over
at
harmony
oops
harmony
grinning
apologetically
string
was
slippy
cut
to
exterior
shot
of
the
burnedout
old
sunnydale
high
school
building
willow
voiceover
calling
riley
cut
to
inside
willow
and
tara
walking
through
the
rubble
this
place
kinda
creeps
me
out
you
shoulda
been
here
when
it
was
a
school
willow
calls
riley
they
walk
on
very
slowly
looking
nervous
oof
darkness
piles
of
it
we
shoulda
brought
a
flashlight
ooh
i
know
willow
reaches
into
her
bag
better
to
light
a
candle
than
curse
the
damn
darkness
willow
smiles
pulls
a
small
bottle
out
of
her
bag
a
little
spell
willow
shows
it
to
tara
fiat
lux
willow
latin
translation
let
there
be
light
willow
throws
the
bottle
at
the
ground
there's
a
big
burst
of
flame
and
then
the
entire
area
is
lit
with
a
soft
diffuse
light
wow
there
that's
better
tara
stares
at
her
in
amazement
willow
calling
riley
come
on
out
she
begins
to
walk
again
tara
follows
still
staring
how'd
you
do
that
with
the
light
oh
you
know
you
taught
me
i
taught
you
teeny
tinkerbell
light
okay
so
i
tinkered
with
the
tinkerbell
it
was
easy
and
besides
isn't
this
better
than
using
a
flashlight
like
some
kind
of
doofus
cut
to
buffy
with
a
flashlight
walking
through
the
caves
calling
riley
riley
answer
me
buffy
mutters
softly
please
she
walks
on
pan
across
the
rocks
with
vines
growing
on
them
we
hear
a
repetitive
knocking
noise
riley
she
rounds
a
corner
and
finds
riley
punching
the
rock
wall
there's
a
large
cavity
in
the
wall
where
he's
clearly
been
punching
for
some
time
he's
shiny
with
sweat
and
looks
tired
riley
not
looking
at
buffy
you
know
this
doesn't
even
hurt
your
hand
is
bleeding
riley
looks
at
her
don't
feel
a
thing
he
moves
to
punch
the
wall
again
but
buffy
stops
him
this
stops
now
i'm
taking
you
to
the
doctor
the
one
from
the
government
you
mean
like
the
ones
who
did
this
to
me
in
the
first
place
riley
puts
up
a
hand
in
a
no
thanks
gesture
and
backs
away
buffy
moving
toward
him
he's
the
only
one
that
understands
what's
wrong
with
you
he's
the
only
one
that
can
help
what's
wrong
with
me
i'm
more
powerful
than
i've
ever
been
buffy
most
people
would
kill
to
feel
this
way
yeah
and
this
feeling
is
going
to
kill
you
riley
your
body
was
not
built
for
this
kind
of
strength
i
can
handle
it
this
is
my
deal
buffy
just
back
off
he
walks
past
her
she
turns
to
watch
him
what
is
this
he
stops
walking
turns
back
to
her
what's
happening
to
you
i
go
back
let
the
government
get
whimsical
with
my
innards
again
they
could
do
anything
that
bestcase
scenario
they
turn
me
into
joe
normal
just
riley
sighs
just
another
guy
and
that's
not
enough
for
you
it's
not
enough
for
you
why
would
you
say
that
come
on
your
last
boyfriend
wasn't
exactly
a
civilian
so
that's
what
this
is
about
you're
going
to
die
all
over
some
macho
pissing
contest
riley
shakes
his
head
it's
not
about
him
it's
about
us
riley
buffy
shakes
her
head
not
understanding
you're
getting
stronger
every
day
more
powerful
i
can't
touch
you
every
day
you're
just
a
little
further
out
of
my
reach
you
wanna
touch
me
buffy
walks
toward
him
i'm
right
here
i'm
not
the
one
running
away
not
yet
so
you
have
this
all
figured
out
i'm
bailing
because
you're
not
in
the
super
club
riley
shrugs
it's
human
nature
buffy
angrily
don't
psych
101
me
buffy
riley
looks
away
not
now
not
after
everything
that
nobody
has
ever
known
me
the
way
you
do
nobody
buffy
riley
doesn't
look
at
her
i've
opened
up
to
you
in
ways
that
i've
never
opened
up
to
god
you're
just
sitting
back
there
thinking
that
none
of
this
means
anything
to
me
riley
still
not
looking
at
her
i
never
said
that
buffy
tearyeyed
because
it
obviously
doesn't
mean
anything
to
you
do
you
really
think
so
little
of
me
buffy
no
no
do
you
think
that
i
spent
the
last
year
with
you
because
you
had
super
powers
if
that's
what
i
wanted
then
i'd
be
dating
spike
buffy
quietly
riley
i
need
you
buffy
he
looks
at
her
looks
apprehensive
i
need
you
with
me
and
i
need
you
healthy
but
if
you
wanna
throw
it
all
away
because
you
don't
trust
me
then

buffy
firmly
then
i'm
still
gonna
make
you
go
to
that
doctor
riley
looks
at
her
looks
away
he
sighs
take
me
to
him
buffy
nods
we
have
to
hurry
she
strides
past
him
but
he
grabs
her
arm
and
turns
her
to
face
him
loving
you
is
the
scariest
thing
i've
ever
done
buffy
i
don't
know
why
she
puts
her
hand
over
his
heart
the
doctor
said
we
didn't
have
much
time
they
walk
off
cut
to
spike
on
the
operating
table
a
sheet
lies
vertically
over
the
top
of
his
head
and
his
eyes
are
closed
as
the
camera
pulls
back
we
see
the
doctor
wearing
rubber
gloves
working
on
spike's
head
harmony
comes
into
view
walking
behind
overheiser
i
read
in
a
magazine
that
some
women
think
a
man's
real
sex
organ
is
his
brain
she
leans
next
to
the
doctor
and
looks
at
where
his
hands
are
yuck
no
contest
i
mean
look
at
it
it's
so
pink
and
wrigglylooking
harmony
grins
suddenly
to
the
doctor

i
touch
it
spike's
eyes
pop
open
spike
and
overheiser
in

no
harmony
looking
over
at
spike's
face
oh

harmony
looks
back
at
spike's
brain
harmony
to
doctor
you

what
it
means
that

even
pick
flowers
what
yes

can
overheiser
softly

quiet

quiet
for
a
moment

quiet
