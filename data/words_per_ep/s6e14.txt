turns
to
go
dawn
watches
with
a
smile
as
soon
as
the
door
closes
behind
buffy
dawn
stops
smiling
stands
there
alone
looking
unhappy
cut
to
graveyard
night
buffy
walks
along
holding
a
large
axe
with
a
metal
handle
suddenly
a
large
demon
with
red
skin
and
a
spiny
crest
on
its
head
leaps
out
behind
her
buffy
whirls
around
the
demon
swings
a
large
sword
at
her
she
ducks
then
blocks
with
her
axe
the
demon's
sword
bends
the
axe
handle
then
pulls
it
out
of
buffy's
hand
it
flies
off
and
lands
in
the
ground
the
demon
swings
at
buffy
again
and
she
gets
hold
of
his
sword
arm
twists
it
around
behind
his
back
suddenly
the
demon
shimmers
and
disappears
buffy
looks
around
in
confusion
the
demon
reappears
behind
her
she
kicks
him
in
the
face
punches
him
kicks
again
he
falls
back
his
sword
goes
flying
up
into
the
air
buffy
catches
the
sword
on
its
way
down
the
demon
charges
her
she
stabs
him
right
in
the
stomach
blue
light
flashes
out
in
a
circle
from
the
wound
the
demon
roars
and
grabs
his
stomach
buffy
pulls
the
sword
out
and
falls
back
onto
the
ground
the
sword
lands
pointdown
in
the
ground
the
demon
falls
to
his
knees
still
roaring
he
shimmers
and
turns
into
a
bolt
of
silver
light
that
shoots
over
to
the
sword
and
into
it
we
can
see
his
face
reflected
in
the
sword's
blade
buffy
is
still
on
the
ground
facing
the
other
way
run
off

afraid
to
face
a
true
warrior

gets
up
and

a
way
out
sure
of

you
all
wanna
leave
dawn
buffy
looking
at
her
'cause
being
stuck
in

that
would
really
suck
right
buffy
frowns
slightly
no
dawnie
it's
just
we
have
more
important
things
to
do
dawn
disgusted
yeah
i
know
important
dawn
gets
up
whatever
that
means
right
dawn
storms
past

willow
xander
and
spike
dawn
what

sits
up
turns
to
face
them
dawn
angrily
what
would
i
know
look
we're
not
accusing
you
of
anything
it's
just
you
were
kind
of
taking
it
personal
down
there
oh
okay

all
just
decided
that
somehow
i'm
responsible
dawn
sourly
great
here's
me
baskin'
in
the
love
no
it's
just
you
know

is
a
cornfield
there
there
isn't
a
cornfield
is
there
dawnie
it's
okay
you
know
we're
not
gonna

i
didn't

anything
you
sure
you
want
me
to
ask
my
other
self
dawn
we're
just
trying
to
figure
out
what's
going
on
dawn
angrily
figure
it
out
yourself
i'm
done
being
talked
to
like
a
kid
well
'cause
you
know
sometimes
we
do
something
that
seems
like
a
good
idea
at
the
time
like
say
invoke
the
power
of
a
musical
amulet
and
it
turns
out
you
know
not
so
much
god
i
didn't
do
anything
i
wish
i
had
dawn
buffy
frowning
i'm
glad
you're
trapped
dawn
very
angrily
how
else
can
i
get
anybody
to
spend
any
time
with
me
dawn
if
you
want
us
to
spend
time
with
you
i
don't
get
out
buffy
stares
at
her
dawn
shrieking
get
out
get
out
get
out
the
others
exit
leaving
only
buffy
and
dawn
dawn
turns
away
angrily
lies
down
on
her
stomach
on
the
bed
again
buffy
stares
at
her
for
a
moment
then
leaves
i
think
she's
possessed
cut
to
downstairs
anya
and
xander
sit
sidebyside
on
the
sofa
she's
a
teenager
we
see
buffy
willow
and
spike
sitting
around
too
tara
comes
in
from
the
dining
room
phones
are
all
out
we're
totally
cut
off
they
all
sigh
and
groan
buffy
quietly
she's
just
so
angry
it
happens
we
all
went
through
it
i
know
i
just
can't
figure
out
why
she
didn't
come
to
me
well
you
have
been
a
little
busy
lately
xander
and
anya
look
at
buffy
she
looks
grim
hey
i
don't
wanna
keep
you
all
from
the
touchyfeelies
but
maybe
the
encounter
group
can
meet
later
say
when
we're
not
trapped
in
a
house
even
if
dawn
does
know
something
she's
obviously
not
gonna
help
us
right
now
we
need
another
way
i
think
magic's
gonna
be
our
best
bet
buffy
willow
looking
alarmed
something
general
you
know
cast
a
wide
net
buffy
tara
nodding
but
willow
xander
gesturing
toward
willow
with
his
head
no
i'll
do
it
tara
willow
fidgeting
nervously
it's
just
oobviously
i
didn't
bring
any
supplies
willow
looks
guilty
buffy
os
well
we
don't
have
any
in

willow
guilty

one
or
or
two
things
sort
of
tara
and
buffy
look
shocked
just
in
case
that's
great
beat
anya
tara
and
buffy
look
somber
in
a
very
bad
way
xander
shaking
finger
at

up
tara
to
willow
just
bring

every
time
it
gets
peckish
i'd
say
we
do
another
spell
but
i
i
think

not
completely
true
is
it
anya
tara

hate
this
i
don't
know
if
there's
even
anything
i
could
do

a
good
way
to

to
sit
around
and
try
nothing
that
was
sarcasm
by
the
way

it's
dangerous
and
so

all
of
us

him
in
the
stomach
spike
leaps
into
the
fray
too
grabbing
the
demon
from
behind
the
demon
flings
anya
off
she
lands
on
the
sofa
he
flings
spike
off
too
and
swings
the
sword
around
randomly
buffy
ducks
watching
for
an
opening
anya
xander
ducks
under
the
sword
swings
and
runs
over
to
the
sofa
the
demon
hits
buffy
in
the
face
and
she
reels
back
spike
attacks
again
distracting
the
demon
so
buffy
can
kick
him
the
demon
falls
to
the
floor
and
melts
into
it
disappearing
the
demon
immediately
reappears
behind
spike
who
grabs
his
sword
arm
the
demon
drops
the
sword
spike
continues
holding
his
arm
and
kicking
him
the
sword
buffy
picks
the
sword
up
off
the
floor
as
spike
continues
struggling
with
the
demon
spike
gives
him
a
kick
in
the
stomach
and
he
reels
backward
as
buffy
attacks
with
the
sword
the
demon
turns
and
runs
into
the
wall
disappearing
into
it
buffy
thrusts
the
sword
into
the
wall
where
he
went
the
same
blue
light
appears
suffusing
everything
as
the
others
watch
the
demon
roars
angrily
close
on
the
sword
as
the
blue
light
fades
and
the
hole
in
the
wall
closes
up
the
demon
once
again
trapped
in
the
sword
buffy
pulls
the
sword
out
of
the
wall
and
breaks
it
in
two
over
her
knee
causing
one
last
flare
of
blue
light
she
throws
the
two
halves
down
buffy
looks
over
at
halfrek
who
lies
on
the
floor
not
moving
her
pendant
get
her
pendant
anya
and
buffy
rush
toward
halfrek
but
before
they
reach
her
she
sits
up
and
puts
out
her
hand
toward
anya
who
goes
flying
backward
onto
the
sofa
again
buffy
stares
halfrek
normal
voice
there
will
be
no
touching
of
the
pendant
halfrek
gets
to
her
feet
and
brushes
herself
off
as

stares
at
her
in
surprise

halfrek
laughs

be
stopped
by
a
sword
in
the
chest

head
this
you

voice
saying
like
'what
if

get
bad
i
mean
really
bad
and
what
if
you
can't
handle
it'
aand
it
made
me
panic

that's
why
i
kept
a
couple
of
things
i
kept
them
so
ii

have
to
think
about
it
so
i
could
focus
on
on
getting
better

time
to
work
without
the
net
