inside
the
mausoleum
luke
tries
to
bite
buffy
but
burns
himself
on
the
cross
hanging
around
her
neck
and
jerks
back
buffy
seizes
the
opportunity
and
push
kicks
him
out
of
the
coffin
she
climbs
out
of
it
and
races
outside
cut
outside
buffy
runs
to
catch
up
with
willow
xander
and
jesse
she
hears
a
vampire
roar
and
a
girl
screaming
and
runs
toward
the
sounds
cut
to
willow
on
the
ground
about
to
be
bitten
no
get
off
hey
the
vampire
looks
up
and
buffy
snap
kicks
him
off
of
willow
he
gets
up
and
runs
away
willow
is
shocked
by
what
she
sees
buffy
quickly
starts
the
hunt
again
willow
gets
up
and
runs
after
her
cut
to
xander
being
dragged
away
by
two
vampires
willow
appears
between
two
gravestones
xander
the
vampires
are
distracted
buffy
takes
advantage
of
the
opening
and
jumps
in
high
punches
one
and
side
kicks
the
other
she
notices
a
dry
branch
on
a
tree
and
breaks
it
off
as
one
of
the
vampires
gets
up
she
plunges
the
stick
into
him
willow
rushes
over
to
xander
who's
still
on
the
ground
xander
are
you
okay
man
something
hit
me
where's
jesse
i
don't
know
they
surrounded
us
that
girl
grabbed
him
and
took
off
which
way
i
don't
know
she
stands
up
straight
and
slowly
scans
the
cemetery
buffy
whispers
jesse
opening
credits
roll
buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

the
library
the
globe
is
spinning
giles
stops
it
while
he
lectures
and
makes
his
way
down
to
where
buffy
willow
and
xander
are
at
the
table
this
world
is
older
than
any
of
you
know
contrary
to
popular
mythology
it
did
not
begin
as
a
paradise
for
untold
eons
demons
walked
the
earth
they
made
it
their
home
their
their
hell
but
in
time
they
lost
their
purchase
on
this
reality
the
way
was
made
for
mortal
animals
for
for
man
all
that
remains
of
the
old
ones
are
vestiges
certain
magicks
certain
creatures
and
vampires
okay
this
is
where
i
have
a
problem
see
because
we're
talking
about
vampires
we're
having
a
talk
with
vampires
in
it
isn't
that
what
we
saw
last
night
no
no
ththose
weren't
vampires
those
were
just
guys
in
thundering
need
of
a
facial
or
maybe
they
had
rabies
it
could
have
been
rabies
aand
that
guy
turning
to
dust
just
a
trick
of
light
buffy
xander
gives
her
a
look
that's
exactly
what
i
said
the
first
time
i
saw
a
vampire
well
after
i
was
done
with
the
screaming
part
oh
i
i
need
to
sit
down
you
are
sitting
down
oh
good
for
me
so
vampires
are
demons
the
books
tell
the
last
demon
to
leave
this
reality
fed
off
a
human
mixed
their
blood
he
was
a
human
form
possessed
infected
by
the
demon's
soul
he
bit
another
and
another
and
so
they
walk
the
earth
feeding
killing
some
mixing
their
blood
with
others
to
make
more
of
their
kind
waiting
for
the
animals
to
die
out
and
the
old
ones
to
return
cut
to
the
sewers
darla
and
luke
are
forcing
jesse
into
the
master's
lair
move
they
reach
the
lair
and
luke
forces
jesse
down
the
slope
to
the
floor
below
the
master
approaches
is
this
for
me
an
offering
master
he's
a
good
one
his
blood
is
pure
master
draws
the
obvious
conclusion
you've
tasted
it
darla
looks
down
in
shame
i'm
your
faithful
dog
you
bring
me
scraps
i
i
didn't
mean
it
i
have
waited
for
three
score
years
i
have
waited
while
you
come
and
go
i
am
stuck
here
here
in
this
house
of
master
with
extreme
contempt
worship
my
ascension
is
almost
at
hand
pray
that
when
it
comes
master
takes
darla
by
the
neck
i'm
in
a
better
mood
master
forgive
me
we
had
more
offerings
but
there
was
trouble
a
girl
and
there
was
a
girl
she
fought
well
and
she
knew
of
our
breed
it
is
possible
that
she
may
be
a
slayer
cut
to
the
library
and
that
would
be
a
what
for
as
long
as
there
have
been
vampires
there's
been
the
slayer
one
girl
in
all
the
world
a
chosen
one
he
loves
doing
this
part
alright
the
slayer
hunts
vampires
buffy
is
a
slayer
don't
tell
anyone
well
i
think
that's
all
the
vampire
information
you
need
except
for
one
thing
how
do
you
kill
them
you
don't
i
do
well
jesse's
my
buffy
interrupts
jesse
is
my
responsibility
i
let
him
get
taken
that's
not
true
if
you
hadn't
shown
up
they
would
have
taken
us
too
does
anybody
mind
if
i
pass
out
breathe
breathe
breathe
buffy
to
giles
this
big
guy
luke
he
talked
about
an
offering
to
the
master
now
i
don't
know
what
or
who
but
if
they
weren't
just
feeding
then
jesse
may
still
be
alive
i'm
gonna
find
him
uh
this
may
be
the
dumb
question
but
shouldn't
we
call
the
police
and
they'd
believe
us
of
course
well
we
don't
have
to
say
vampires
we
we
could
just
say
that
there's
a
a
bad
man
they
couldn't
handle
it
even
of
they
did
show
up
they'd
only
come
with
guns
you
have
no
idea
where
they
took
jesse
i
looked
around
but
soon's
they
got
clear
of
the
graveyard
they
could
have
just
voom
they
can
fly
they
can
drive
oh
i
don't
remember
hearing
a
car
let's
take
an
enormous
intuitive
leap
shall
we
and
say
they
went
underground
vampires
really
jam
on
sewer
systems
you
can
get
anywhere
in
the
entire
town
without
catching
any
rays
but
i
didn't
see
any
access
around
there
well
there's
an
electrical
tunnel
that
runs
under
the
whole
town
if
we
had
a
diagnostic
of
the
tunnel
system
it
might
indicate
a
a
meeting
place
it
would
uh
i
suppose
we
could
go
to
the
building
commission
we
so
don't
have
time
uh
guys
there
may
be
another
way
cut
to
the
master's
lair
a
slayer
have
you
any
proof
only
that
she
fought
me
and
yet
lives
hmm
very
nearly
proof
enough
i
can't
remember
the
last
time
that
happened
1843
madrid
he
caught
me
sleeping
she
mustn't
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
the
harvest
i
would
never
let
that
happen
don't
worry
about
it
i
believe
she'll
come
to
us
we
have
something
she
wants
luke
smiles
at
jesse
if
she
is
a
slayer
and
this
boy
lives
she'll
try
to
save
him
i
thought
you
nothing
more
than
a
meal
boy
he
moves
behind
jesse
and
takes
his
neck
congratulations
you've
just
been
upgraded
to
bait
cut
to
the
library
willow
has
the
city
plans
on
the
computer
monitor
there
it
is
that
runs
under
the
graveyard
i
don't
see
any
access
so
all
the
city
plans
are
just
uh
open
to
the
public
um
well
iin
a
way
i
sort
of
stumbled
onto
them
when
i
accidentally
decrypted
the
city
council's
security
system
someone's
been
naughty
there's
nothing
here
this
is
useless
i
think
you're
being
a
bit
hard
on
yourself
you're
the
one
that
told
me
that
i
wasn't
prepared
enough
understatement
buffy
exhales
i
thought
i
was
on
top
of
everything
and
then
that
monster
luke
came
out
of
nowhere
she
flashes
back
to
the
fight
in
the
mausoleum
what
he
didn't
come
out
of
nowhere
he
came
from
behind
me
i
was
facing
the
entrance
he
came
from
behind
me
and
he
didn't
follow
me
out
the
access
to
the
tunnels
is
in
the
mausoleum
the
girl
must
have
doubled
back
with
jesse
after
i
got
out
god
i
am
so
mentally
challenged
so
what's
the
plan
we
saddle
up
right
there's
no
'we'
okay
i'm
the
slayer
and
you're
not
i
knew
you'd
throw
that
back
in
my
face
xander
this
is
deeply
dangerous
i'm
inadequate
that's
fine
i'm
less
than
a
man
buffy
i'm
not
anxious
to
go
into
a
dark
place
full
of
monsters
but
i
do
want
to
help
i
need
to
well
then
help
me
i've
been
researching
this
harvest
affair
it
seems
to
be
some
sort
of
preordained
massacre
rivers
of
blood
hell
on
earth
quite
charmless
i'm
a
bit
fuzzy
however
on
the
details
it
may
be
that
you
can
wrest
some
information
from
that
dread
machine
everyone
stares
at
him
he
looks
back
at
them
all
that
was
a
bit
um
british
wasn't
it
buffy
smiles
welcome
to
the
new
world
giles
to
willow
i
want
you
to
go
on
the
'net
oh
sure
i
can
do
that
willow
begins
to
type
then
i'm
outta
here
if
jesse's
alive
i'll
bring
him
back
buffy
starts
to
leave
do
i
have
to
tell
you
to
be
careful
buffy
turns
back
gives
giles
a
look
and
goes
cut
outside
buffy
is
making
strides
for
a
side
gate
mr
flutie
is
there
and
stops
her
and
where
do
we
think
we're
going

buffy
turns
to
face
him
i
me
we're
not
leaving
school
grounds
are
we
no
no
i'm
just
admiring
the
fence
you
know
this
is
quality
fence
work
because

we
were
leaving
schools
grounds
on
our
second
day
at
a
new
school
after
getting
kicked
out
of
our
old
school
for
delinquent
behavior
do
you
see
where
i'm
going
with
this
mr
giles
what
he
asked
me
to
get
a
book
for
him
uh
from
the
store
'cause
i
have
a
free
period
and
i'm
a
big
reader
did
it
mention
that
in
my
transcripts
mr
giles
ask
him
mr
flutie
swings
the
gate
closed
well
maybe
that's
how
they
do
things
in
britain
they've
got
that
royal
family
and
all
kinds
of
problems
mr
flutie
locks
it
but
here
at
sunnydale
nobody
leaves
campus
while
school's
in
session
are
we
clear
we're
clear
that's
the
buffy
summers
i
want
in
my
school
sensible
girl
with
her
feet
on
the
ground
he
turns
and
leaves
buffy
watches
him
go
when
he's
gone
a
ways
she
crouches
and
leaps
the
fence
cut
to
willow
and
xander
walking
down
a
hall
murder
death
disaster
what
else
paranormal
unexplained
did
you
get
natural
disasters
earthquake
flood
rain
of
toads
right
rain
of
toads
do
you
think
they'd
have
anything
like
that
in
the
paper
i'll
put
it
on
the
computer
search
if
it's
in
there
it'll
turn
up
anything
that'll
lead
us
to
vampires
and
i
in
the
meantime
will
help
by
standing
around
like
an
idiot
not
like
an
idiot
just
standing
buffy
doesn't
want
you
getting
hurt
they
stop
in
front
of
their
next
class
i
don't
want
you
getting
hurt
this
is
just
too
much
i
mean
yesterday
my
life's
like
'uh
oh
pop
quiz'
today
it's
'rain
of
toads'
i
know
and
everyone
else
thinks
it's
just
a
normal
day
nobody
knows
it's
like
we've
got
this
big
secret
we
do
that's
what
a
secret
is
when
you
know
something
other
guys
don't
right
look
maybe
you
should
get
to
class
xander
indicates
the
door
you
mean
'we'
we
should
get
to
class
yeah
buffy'll
be
okay
whatever's
down
there
i
think
she
can
handle
it
yeah
i
do
too
so
do
i
cut
to
inside
the
mausoleum
buffy
comes
in
slowly
looking
and
listening
she
scans
around
satisfied
that
no
one's
there
she
walks
down
the
steps
to
the
floor
she
hears
a
rat
behind
her
and
twists
to
look
toward
the
sound
she
continues
and
finds
the
tunnel
access
it's
locked
with
a
chain
she
lifts
the
lock
angel
appears
behind
her
angel
exhales
i
don't
suppose
you've
got
a
key
on
you
they
really
don't
like
me
dropping
in
buffy
faces
him
why
not
they
really
don't
like
me
how
could
that
possibly
be
i
knew
you'd
figure
out
this
entryway
sooner
or
later
actually
i
thought
it
was
gonna
be
a
little
sooner
sorry
you
had
to
wait
buffy
exhales
okay
look
if
you're
gonna
be
popping
up
with
this
cryptic
wise
man
act
on
a
regular
basis
can
you
at
least
tell
me
your
name
angel
angel
it's
a
pretty
name
she
turns
to
the
tunnel
entrance
don't
go
down
there
buffy
turns
back
deal
with
my
going
you
shouldn't
be
putting
yourself
at
risk
tonight
is
the
harvest
unless
you
can
prevent
it
the
master
walks
well
if
this
harvest
thing
is
such
a
suckfest
why
don't
you
stop
it
'cause
i'm
afraid
she
looks
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
spins
around
quickly
kicking
open
the
doors
to
the
tunnel
she
turns
back
to
him
they'll
be
expecting
you
i've
got
a
friend
down
there
or
at
least
a
potential
friend
do
you
know
what
it's
like
to
have
a
friend
he
lowers
his
eyes
as
a
look
of
sadness
fills
them
that
wasn't
supposed
to
be
a
stumper
they
look
at
each
other
a
moment
longer
when
you
hit
the
tunnels
head
east
towards
the
school
that's
where
you're
likely
to
find
them
you
gonna
wish
me
luck
angel
says
nothing
they
look
at
each
other
for
another
moment
then
buffy
turns
and
heads
into
the
tunnels
he
watches
her
go
angel
whispers
good
luck
part

inside
the
tunnels
buffy
comes
down
a
flight
of
stairs
she
looks
around
she
hears
rats
one
crawls
across
her
shoes
she
slowly
starts
down
the
tunnels
there
are
lights
at
intervals
when
she
reaches
an
intersection
xander
surprises
her
from
behind
did
you
see
anything
buffy
exhales
in
fright
xander
what
are
you
doing
here
something
stupid
i
followed
you
well
you
i
couldn't
just
sit
at
home
and
do
nothing
i
understand
now
go
away
no
xander
you're
gonna
have
to
look
jesse's
my
bud
okay
if
i
can
help
him
out
that's
what
i
gotta
do
buffy
considers
then
nods
her
head
for
him
to
follow
she
starts
down
the
tunnel
again
besides
it's
this
or
chem
class
cut
to
them
reaching
the
top
of
some
stairs
okay
so
crosses
garlic
stake
through
the
heart
that'll
get
it
done
cool
of
course
i
don't
actually
have
any
of
those
things
buffy
hands
him
a
cross
good
thinking
well
the
part
of
my
brain
that
would
tell
me
to
bring
that
stuff
is
still
busy
telling
me
not
to
come
down
here
i
have
this
though
xander
turns
on
a
flashlight
turn
that
off
xander
turns
it
off
okay
okay
so
what
else
what
else
what
for
vampire
slayage
oh
fire
beheading
sunlight
holy
water
the
usual
you've
done
some
beheading
in
your
time
oh
yeah
there
was
this
time
i
was
pinned
down
by
this
guy
that
played
left
tackle
for
varsity
well
at
least
he
used
to
before
he
was
a
vampire
anyway
he
had
this
really
really
thick
neck
and
all
i
had
was
a
little
little
exacto
knife
xander
laughs
nervously
you're
not
loving
this
story
no
actually
i
find
it
oddly
comforting
cut
to
the
library
giles
is
reading
from
a
volume
'for
they
will
gather
and
be
gathered
from
the
vessel
pours
life'
p
pours
life
he
turns
the
page
back
to
the
picture
of
satan
feeding
power
to
a
man
'on
the
night
of
the
crescent
moon
the
first
past
the
solstice
it
will
come'
of
course
that's
tonight
cut
to
the
computer
lab
cordelia
is
struggling
with
her
assignment
no
it's
supposed
to
find
the
syntax
and
match
it
or
wait
are
we
going
to
the
bronze
tonight
no
we're
going
to
the
other
cool
place
in
sunnydale

looks
confused
of
course
we're
going
to
the
bronze
friday
night
no
cover
but
you
should
have
been
there
last
night
'cause
i
ran
into
buffy
willow
overhears
the
conversation
and
can
she
be
any
weirder
she
attacked
me
do
you
believe
it
harmony
exhales
i
think
we
did
this
part
wrong
why
do
we
have
to
devise
these
programs
isn't
that
what
nerds
are
for
cordelia
whispers
indicating
willow
what'd
she
do
harmony
looks
at
willow's
screen
then
back
uh
she's
doing
something
else
okay
and
then
pattern
run
right
or
go
to
end
that's
it
maybe
so
anyway
i
come
outta
the
bathroom
and
she
comes
running
at
me
screaming
with
a
stick
'i'm
gonna
kill
you
i'm
gonna
kill
you'
i
swear
who
buffy
the
new
girl
what's
her
deal
well
she's
crazed
did
you
hear
about
her
old
school
cordelia
and
the
boy
both
shake
their
heads
booted
well
i
exhibit
no
surprise
why
was
she
kicked
out
uh
because
she's
a
psycho
loony
willow
interrupting
no
she's
not
what
willow
turns
to
them
she's
not
a
psycho
you
don't
even
know
her
excuse
me
who
gave
you
permission
to
exist
willow
turns
away
eyes
down
do
i
horn
in
on
your
private
discussions
no
why
because
you're
boring
willow
gets
up
and
goes
to
get
her
printouts
okay
i
think
the
program's
done
finally
the
nightmare
ends
okay
so
how
do
we
save
it
deliver
deliver
where's
that
cordelia
searches
the
keyboard
oh
she
hits
the
'del'
key
and
her
program
disappears
cut
to
the
tunnels
they're
close
how
can
you
tell
no
more
rats
xander
turns
on
his
flashlight
and
spots
jesse
on
the
ground

reacts
and
jumps
up
jjjesse
xander
the
two

down
the
tunnel
vampires
come
around
the
corner
cut
to
xander
buffy
and
jesse
in

buffy
grabs
him
from

and
throws
him
out
of

leaps
on

barrel
and
begins
to

well
ii'm

surfed
through
the
old
newspapers
around
the
time
of
that
big
earthquake
back
in
'37
and
for
several
months
before
there
were
a
rash
of
murders
willow
hands
him
her
printouts
great
ii
mean
well
not
not
'great'
in
a
good
way
uh
um
uh
go
on
well

sound
like
the
kind
you
were
looking
for
willow
flips
through
the
printouts
throats

willow
looks
squeamish
it's
all
coming
together
i
rather
wish
it
weren't
cut
to
the
master's
lair
luke
approaches
the
master
and
kneels
before
him
the
master
offers
his
hand
luke
takes
it
and
kisses
it
he
releases
it
and
the
master
turns
it
over
to
offer
the
underside
of
his
wrist
darla
is
watching
and
smiles
luke
opens
the
cuff
of
the
master's
sleeve
and
pulls
it
back
he
takes
his
hand
again
sinks
his
fangs
into
the
wrist
above
it
and
drinks
of
the
blood
he
releases
the
hand
and
the
master
takes
it
back
my
blood
is
your
blood
my
soul
is
your
soul
my
body
is
your
instrument
the
master
steps
down
to
luke
and
begins
to
draw
a
threepointed
star
on
luke's
forehead
with
the
blood
still
flowing
from
his
wrist
on
this
most
hallowed
night
we
are
as
one
luke
is
the
vessel
darla
smiles
even
wider
every
soul
he
takes
will
feed
me
and
their
souls
will
grant
me
the
strength
to
free
myself
tonight
i
shall
walk
the
earth
and
the
stars
themselves
will
hide
cut
to
the
library
willow
is
looking
at
one
of
giles'
volumes
she
hears
the
door
open
and
looks
up
to
see
xander
and
buffy
come
in
did
you
find
jesse
yeah
was
he
dead
worse
buffy
sits
down
at
the
end
of
the
table
i'm
sorry
willow
we
were
too
late
and
they
were
waiting
for
us
at
least
you
two
are
okay
xander
kicks
a
trash
can
violently
buffy
is
startled
i
don't
like
vampires
i'm
gonna
take
a
stand
and
say
they're
not
good
buffy
turns
to
giles
so
giles
got
anything
that
can
make
this
day
any
worse
he
goes
over
to
the
whiteboard
and
puts
down
his
pen
how
about
the
end
of
the
world
knew
i
could
count
on
you
this
is
what
we
know
some
sixty
years
ago
a
very
old
very
powerful
vampire
came
to
this
shore
not
just
to
feed
he
came
'cause
this
town's
a
mystical
who's
it
yes
the
spanish
who
first
settled
here
called
it
'boca
del
inferno'
roughly
translated
'hellmouth'
it's
a
sort
of
um
portal
between
this
reality
and
the
next
this
vampire
hopes
to
open
it
bring
the
demons
back
end
of
the
world
but
he
blew
it
or
i
mean
there
was
an
earthquake
that
swallowed
half
the
town
and
him
too
you
see
opening
dimensional
portals
is
a
tricky
business
odds
are
he
got
himself
stuck
rather
like
a
uh
cork
in
a
bottle
and
this
harvest
thing
is
to
get
him
out
it
comes
once
in
a
century
on
this
night
the
master
can
draw
power
from
one
of
his
minions
while
it
feeds
enough
power
to
break
free
and
open
the
portal
the
minion
is
called
the
vessel
and
he
bears
this
symbol
he
draws
a
threepointed
star
on
the
whiteboard
so
i
dust
anyone
sporting
that
symbol
and
no
harvest
simply
put
yes
any
idea
where
this
little
gettogether
is
being
held
there
there
are
a
number
of
possibilities
they're
goin'
to
the
bronze
are
you
sure
come
on
all
those
tasty
young
morsels
all
over
the
place
anyway

where
jesse's
gonna
be
trust
me
giles
grabs
his
coat

about

her
when
buffy
kicks
the
vampire
down
from
above
them
luke
watches
him
land
with
a
thud
buffy
approaches
the
railing

and
executes
a
roundoff
to
get
down
she
lands
on
a
pool
table
a
vampire
attacks
from
her
right
buffy
does
a
front
walkover
off
of
the
table
grabbing
a
pool
cue
on
the
way
when
she
lands
she
thrusts
it
into
her
attacker

releases
cordelia

yours
buffy
shrugs
works
for
me
she
runs
and
cartwheels
up
onto
the
stage
and
immediately
launches
into
a
full
spinning
hook
kick
luke
staggers
into
a
pile
of
chairs
buffy
assumes
a
fighting
position
luke
gets
up
and
growls
he
comes
at
her
and
swings
but
she
ducks
the
punch
and
comes
up
behind
him
he
tries
a
backhand
punch
but
she
blocks
him
holds
onto
his
arm
and
gives
him
three
roundhouse
kicks
to
his
stomach
before
he
shakes
loose
she
takes
her
stake
and
lunges
at
him
he
blocks
the
lunge
knocking
the
stake
from
her
grip
he
lifts
her
up
and
throws
her
into
a
pile
of
boxes
cut
to
the
back

and
xander
break
in

and
lands
a
backhand
punch
on
luke's
face
knocking
him
into
another
pile
of
stuff
he's
dazed
buffy
turns
to
see
a
vampire
grab
xander
she
grabs
a
cymbal
from
a
drum
set
and
throws
it
at
the
vampire
like
a
frisbee
xander
sees
it
coming
and
ducks
the
cymbal
decapitates
the
vampire
head's
up

can't
resist
a
chuckle
luke
grabs
her
from

at
xander

being
held
tightly
from
behind
by
luke
i
always
wanted
to

slayer
cut
to
the
back
where
giles
and
willow
are
still
guiding
people
out

at
a
time

crosses
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
in
front
of
some
stairs
darla

standing
on
the
steps
above
him

knocking
him
to
the
floor

a
part

luke
roars
and
moves
in
to
bite
buffy
she
senses
his
proximity
and
snaps
her
head
back
to
land
a
headbutt
on
his
face
knocking
him
off
of
her
and
back
to
the
wall
she
turns
to
him
winded
how'd
it
taste

to
giles
and
darla
struggling
on
the
floor
willow
approaches
them
while
taking
out
a
jar
of
holy
water

off
of
him
darla
is
distracted
and
looks
up
willow
throws
the
holy
water
at
her
it
burns
her
face
and
steams
she
gets
up
and
runs
from
the
club
screaming
cut
to
jesse
and
xander
jesse
grabs
xander
by
the
jacket
and
lifts
him
around
against
a
wall
xander
has
the
stake
pointed
at
jesse's
chest
ooo
alright

me
out
of
my
misery

don't
have
the
guts
a
fleeing
patron
bumps
into
jesse
impaling
him
on
the
stake
xander
lets
go
of
the
stake
and
jesse
begins
to
fall
he
turns
to
ashes
before
he
even
hits
the
floor
two
vampires
grab
xander
cut
to
buffy
she
grabs
a
microphone
stand
and
holds
it
like
a
javelin
you
forget
metal
can't
hurt
me
there's
something
you
forgot
about
too
sunrise
she
throws
the
stand
at
the
window
behind
luke
he
ducks
and
it
breaks
the
window
behind
him
a
bright
light
pours
in
through
it
buffy
spies
the
stake
she
dropped
on
the
stage
and
picks
it
up
luke
gets
up
and
shields
his
face
with
his
hands
expecting
to
be
burned
he
stops
when
he
realizes
it's
only
a
bright
lamp
buffy
lunges
at
him
from
behind
and
jams
the
stake
home
it's
in
about
nine
hours
moron
luke
begins
to
stagger
off
of
the
stage
cut
to
the
master
he's
testing
the
strength
of
his
confines
cut
to
luke
he
continues
to
stagger
cut
to
the
master
still
testing
cut
to
luke
he
falls
from
the
stage
and
turns
to
ash
cut
to
the
master
he
feels
luke's
death
and
falls
to
his
knees
noooooooo
noooooooo
cut
to
buffy
she
stares
at
luke's
ashes
the
two
vampires
still
have
xander
she
lifts
her
gaze
to
meet
theirs
the
vampires
panic
and
run
cut
to
outside
the
vampires
run
past
angel
standing
behind
some
boxes
stacked
against
a
wall
he
watches
them
run
he
looks
back
the
other
way
she
did
it
i'll
be
damned
he
walks
away
cut
inside
to
the
stage
buffy
hops
down
to
the
floor
giles
and
willow
meet
her
i
take
it
it's
over
did
we
win
well
we
averted
the
apocalypse
i
give
us
points
for
that
one
thing's
for
sure
nothing's
ever
gonna
be
the
same
cut
to
sunnydale
high
the
next
monday
everything
appears
normal
buffy
walks
along
and
overhears
cordelia
well
i
heard
it
was
rival
gangs
you
know
fighting
for
turf
but
all
i
can
tell
you
is
they
were
an
ugly
way
of
looking
and
buffy
like
knew
them
which
is
just
too
weird
i
mean
i
don't
even
remember
that
much
but
i'm
telling
you
it
was
a
freak
show
oh
i
wish
i'd
been
there
you
should
have
been
there
it
was
so
creepy
she
and
her
friend
walk
off
buffy
meets
xander
what
exactly
were
you
expecting
i
don't
know
something
i
mean
the
dead
rose
we
should
at
least
have
an
assembly
they
run
into
giles
and
willow
and
the
four
continue
to
walk
people
have
a
tendency
to
rationalize
what
they
can
and
forget
what
they
can't
believe
me
i've
seen
it
happen
well
i'll
never
forget
it
none
of
it
good
next
time
you'll
be
prepared
next
time
next
time
is
why
we've
prevented
the
master
from
freeing
himself
and
opening
the
mouth
of
hell
that's
not
to
say
he's
going
to
stop
trying
i'd
say
the
fun
is
just
beginning
more
vampires
they
stop
walking
not
just
vampires
the
next
threat
we
face
may
be
something
quite
different
i
can
hardly
wait
we're
at
the
center
of
a
mystical
convergence
here
we
may
in
fact
stand
between
the
earth
and
its
total
destruction
well
i
gotta
look
on
the
bright
side
maybe
i
can
still
get
kicked
out
of
school
the
three
students
continue
to
class
giles
stays
behind
and
watches
them
go
oh
yeah
that's
a
plan
'cause
lots
of
schools
aren't
on
hellmouths
maybe
you
could
blow
something
up
they're
really
strict
about
that
i
was
thinking
of
a
more
subtle
approach
y'know
like
excessive
not
studying
giles
turns
to
go
back
to
his
library
the
earth
is
doomed
the
end
