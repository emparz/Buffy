she
drops

and
scowls
walking
to
the
other
room
xander
follows
grabs
her
arm
what
are
you
doing
what
kind
of
gratitude
is
that
anya
quietly
i
know
i
know
it's
just
he
keeps
saying
he's
going
and
then
he
doesn't
and
i
keep
almost
being
in
charge
but
then
i'm
not
and
maybe
he
shouldn't
be
going
at
all
but
we
can't
talk
about
that
anya
agitated
and
it
all
just
leaves
me
with
this
stress
and
bossiness
stored
up
and
it
just
leaks
out
just
give
it
time
ahn
this
is
hard
for
all
of
us
just
be
patient
i
was
being
patient
but
it
took
too
long
i
mean
ii
miss
buffy
i
do
but
life
shouldn't
just
stop
because
she's
gone
i'm
sick
of
waiting
to
take
over
here
and
i'm
sick
of
waiting
to
tell
everyone
about
us
xander
looks
nervously
over
his
shoulder
lowers
his
voice
we've
talked
about
this
we
can't
announce
our
engagement
while
things
are
so
up
in
the
air
why
not
it's
happy
news
happy
news
in
hard
times
is
a
good
thing
it
is
but
if
things
go
as
planned
everything
could
be
different
xander
anya
sighs
let's
just
hold
on
you've
been
saying
that
all
summer
please
anya
we'll
know
more
after
we
talk
to
willow
and
tara
tonight
fine
whatever
just
remember
that
this
whole
marriage
thing
was
your
stupid
idea
i
didn't
ask
to
be
all
crazy
she
walks
off
xander
watches
her
go
cut
to
exterior
of
the
summers
house
night
cut
to
inside
dawn
comes
out
of
the
kitchen
holding
a
cup
and
walks
down
the
hall
so
my
homeroom
teacher
ms
lefcort
was
like
your
sister's
an
example
to
us
all
hmm
she
wanted
to
make
it
national
buffy
day
she
puts
the
glass
on
the
coffeetable
and
sits
on
the
sofa
next
to
spike
there's
a
pizza
box
on
the
coffeetable
and
a
plate
with
a
halfeaten
slice
of
pizza
makes
sense
it
does
yeah
she
responded
to
buffybot
because
a
robot
is
predictable
boring
perfect
teacher's
pet
that's
all
schools
are
you
know
just
factories
spewing
out
mindless
little
automatons
he
sees
dawn's
raised
eyebrows
spike
quickly
who
go
on
to
be
very
valuable
and
productive
members
of
society
and
you
should
go
spike
quieter
because
buffy
would
want
you
to
beat
they
both
look
pensive
check
one
mindless
automaton
coming
up
they
sit
quietly
on
the
sofa
for
a
moment
so
uh
what
do
you
fancy
bit
uh
game
of
rummy
spike
gets
up
well
uh
willow
and
tara
said
they'd
be
back
early
dawn
spike
goes
to
a
side
table
opens
a
drawer
you
don't
really
have
to
hang
i
mean
if
you're
bored

yeah
i
do
spike
gets
a
pack
of
cards
out
of
the
drawer
pulls
a
chair
over
to
the
coffee
table
opposite
dawn
but
i'm
fine
alone
it's
not
like
anyone's
coming
after
me
i'm
not
the
key
dawn
spike
sets
the
chair
down
or
if
i
am
i
don't

sits
in
the
chair
well
i'm
just
saying

slams
the
cards
down
hard
on
the
table
dawn
jumps

not
looking
at
her

not
leaving
you
to
get
hurt
spike
softly
not
again
they
look
at
each
other
spike
points
to
the
cards
now
deal
dawn
picks
up
the
cards
cut
to
the
street
night
a
young
woman
closes
up
a
shop
and
turns
to
walk
down
the
street
putting
keys
in
her
purse
it's
dark
and
very
quiet
she
pauses
looks
behind
her
walks
on
she
pauses
again
looks
back
again
resumes
walking
very
quickly
she
enters
an
alley
and
a
vampire
grabs
her
from
behind
she
screams
the
vampire
pulls
her
back
against
him
and
prepares
to
bite
buffybot
os
don't
be
scared
the
vampire
looks
up
in
surprise
i'm
going
to
kill
him
slayer

the
girl
does
just
that
the
vamp
tries
to
edge
away
too
buffybot
rolls
her
eyes

you
she
runs
after
him
he
pushes
a
dumpster
into
her
path
she
vaults
over
it
and
lands
on
top
of
him
knocking
him
down
they
both
get
up
and
she
brings
him
down
again
with
a
circlekick
he
gets
up
and
she
punches
him

him
down
again
he
crawls
toward
an
empty
glass
bottle
grabs
it
and
hits
buffybot
in
the
face
with
it
she
stumbles
back
and
the
vamp
gets
up
the
broken
glass
has
torn
a
hole
in
the
bot's
forehead
and
we
can
see
sparks
flying
around
it
you're
you're
you're
you're
a
machine
buffybot
smiles
thank
you
he
scrambles
to
his
feet
and
begins
backing
away
stop
she
walks
forward
directly
into
a
stack
of
large
kegs
she
backs
up
a
few
steps
and
walks
into
them
again
the
vamp
watches
begins
to
smile
she
continues
walking
into
the
kegs
again
and
again
vampires
beware
grinning
the
vamp
turns
and
runs
off
the
bot
continues
walking
into
the
kegs

i
need
you
on
board
here
it's
just

xander
fidgets
nervously
it
feels
wrong
it
is
wrong
tara
willow
looks
surprised
it's
against
all
the
laws
of
nature
and
practically
impossible
to
do
but
it's
what
we
agreed
to
ifif
you
guys
are
changing
your
minds
willow
nobody's
changing
their
minds
period
excuse
me
who
made
you
the
boss
of
the
group
you
did
you
said
willow
should
be
boss
tara
willow
moves
away
and
then
you
said
let's
vote
and
it
was
unanimous
and
then
you
made
her
this
little
plaque
that
said
boss
of
us
you
put
little
sparkles
on
it
valid
points
all
but
we
i
mean
xander
comes
out
from
behind
the
coffeetable
goes
over
to
willow
who
is
again
at
the
other
table
putting
stuff
in
a
bag
we
were
just
talking
then
xander
i
can
do
this
i
promise
but
not
without
you
should
we
maybe
tell
giles
you
know
now
that
we're
really
ready
it's
not
like
he's
going
anywhere
ever
no
no
one
else
can
know
not
giles
not
spike
not
dawn
willow
quietly
they
might
not
understand
what
if
something
does
go
wrong
i'm
telling
you
it
won't
scenario
we
raise
buffy
from
the
grave
she
tries
to
eat
our
brains
do
we
a
congratulate
ourselves
on
a
job
well
done
willow
xander
this
isn't
zombies
zombies
don't
eat
brains
anyway
unless
instructed
to
by
their
zombie
masters
a
lot
of
people
get
that
wrong
this
isn't
like
dawn
trying
to
bring
mrs
summers
back
or
anything
we've
dealt
with
before
buffy
didn't
die
a
natural
death
she
was
killed
by
mystical
energy
which
means
we
do
have
a
shot
it
means
more
than
that
willow
to
xander
it
means
we
don't
know
where
she
really
is
we
saw
her
body
will
we
buried
it
her
body
yeah
but
her
soul
her
essence
i
mean
that
could
be
somewhere
else
she
could
be
trapped
inin
some
sort
of
hell
dimension
like
angel
was
willow
tearfully
suffering
eternal
torment
just
because
she
saved
us
and
i'm
not
gonna
let
i'm
not
gonna
leave
her
there
willow
intensely
it's
buffy
xander
looks
at
her
for
a
long
moment
what
time
do
we
meet
cut
to
willow
entering
the
summers
house
she
sees
spike
and
the
buffybot
in
the
living
room
buffybot
shouts
willow
the
bot
walks
toward
willow
knocking
over
a
side
table
with
a
vase
on
it
spike
catches
the
vase
willow
comes
into
the
room
as
the
bot
walks
into
a
wall
what
happened
where's
dawn
willow
grabs
the
bot
and
pulls
her
away
from
the
wall
giving
spike
a
questioning
look
upstairs
in
bed
but
the
bot
here
seems
to
have
got
into
a
scrape
while
she
was
on
patrol
willow
positions
the
bot
in
front
of
her
and
looks
at
the
cut
on
her
forehead
i
think
my
feet
are
broken
eh
looks
more
like
a
short
in
the
navigational
system
she
steers
the
bot
over
to
the
sofa
and
sits
her
down
while
talking
to
spike
can
you
get
me
a
flashlight
it's
in
the
uh
kitchen
spike
heads
for
the
kitchen
she
wanted
to
go
out
and
look
for
you
again
but
i
figured
there
are
enough
things
in
sunnydale
that
go
bump
in
the
night
spike
exits
willow
sits
facing
the
bot
good
thinking
but
my
homing
device
locates
you
when
i
am
injured
i
am
programmed
to
go
to
you
willow
nods
right
i
know
still
i
think
just
this
once
it
was
a
good
idea
to
stay
put
willow
lifts
the
bot's
shirt
and
peels
back
the
skin
over
her
stomach
revealing
various
wires
and
circuitry
spike
was
right
willow
pokes
at
the
bot's
innards
the
bot
looks
up
and
smiles
at
spike
as
he
comes
back
in
with
the
flashlight
sorry
i
questioned
you
spike
buffybot
spike
looks
surprised
you
know
i
admire
your
brain
almost
as
much
as
your
washboard
abs
buffybot
big
smile
spike
looks
pained
spike
quietly
to
willow
i
told
you
to
make
her
stop
doing
that
i
did
i
mean
i
thought
i
got
all
that
stuff
out
of
the
program
we
see
that
willow
has
the
bot
hooked
up
to
a
laptop
computer
well
you've
got
her
opened
up
fix
it
willow
typing
sure
i
mean
i
have
a
lot
of
work
here
but
i'll
see
what
i
can
do
focus
on
the
bot's
face
watching
with
interest
as
spike
crosses
into
the
frame
and
off
to
the
left
willow
doesn't
see
him
moving
can
you
shine
the
flashlight
right
here
willow
turns
but
spike
is
gone
spike
we
see
spike
opening
the
front
door
he
grabs
his
coat
and
leaves
did
i
say
something
wrong
willow
typing
no
it's
not
your
fault
buffybot
pensive
i
think
spike
stopped
liking
me
that's
not
true
hehe
thinks
you're
swell
then
how
come
he
never
looks
at
me
any
more
even
when
he's
talking
to
me
beat
the
bot
seems
anxious
for
willow
to
explain
willow
nervous
he
just
gets
cranky
the
way
vampires
do
now
just
relax
i
am
gonna
make
you
good
as
new
the
bot
continues
to
stare
at
willow
with
a
small
frown
willow
continues
typing
i
promise
fade
to
exterior
of
the
house
night
cut
to
willow

asleep
in
joyce's
bed
snuggled
up
together

wide
awake
staring
at
the
ceiling
after
a
long
moment
she
gets
up
cut
to
dawn
walking
down
the
hall
pushing
open
the
door
to
buffy's
room
the
bot
lies
on
buffy's
bed
eyes
open
with
some
wires
coming
out
of
her
body
and
some
equipment
blinking
and
beeping
steadily
dawn
walks
farther
into
the
room
pan
across
what
looks
like
a
battery
or
electric
generator
on
the
floor
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
wires
extend
out
of
it
and
into

stomach

lies
on
her
back
with
her
shirt
pushed
up

eyes
are
open
dawn
goes
over
and
lies
down
on
the
bed
beside
the
buffybot
cuddling
up
against
her
the
bot
doesn't
move
just
lies
there
dawn
closes
her
eyes

cut
to
the
workout
room
buffybot
is
practicing
with
giles
he
has
padded
targets
on
both
hands

she
punches
them
in
a
rapid
sequence
that
was
splendid
giles
she
stops
hitting
now
try
it
again

giles
panting
only
this
time
remember
your
breathing
the
bot
looks
confused
for
a
moment
then
takes
a
deep
breath
and
blows
it
out
through
her
lips
in
one
long
breath
as
she
hits
the
targets
again
and
again
no
uh
that's
good
but
uh

giles
we
see
anya
come
in
and
stop
in
the
doorway
watching
think
of
the
breath
as
chi
air
as
a
a
life
source
i
don't
require
oxygen
to
live
of
course
strictly
speaking
but
anya
um

giles
walks
into
the
room
maybe
you
should
stick
to
the
standard
drill
you
know
you
don't
want
her
to
blow
another
gasket
i'm
testing
her
responses
after
her
injury
i
see
no
harm
in
imparting
a
little
eastern
philosophy
well
i
just
think
that
the
concept
of
chi
might
be
a
little
you
know
hard
for
her
to
grasp
giles
drops
his
arms
in
exasperation
then
puts
hands
on
hips
you
know
she's
not
the
descendant
of
a
long
line
of
mystical
warriors
she's
the
descendant
of
a
toaster
oven
yes
well
i
appreciate
your
input
anya
but
i
think
buffybot
has
responded
nicely
to
our
sessions
buffybot
smiles
happily
giles
lifts
his
hands
and
she
prepares
to
resume
well
you're
the
boss
anya
to
herself
still
anya
turns
and
walks
out
giles
drops
his
hands
again
annoyed
would
you
like
to
test
me
again
no
perhaps
we
should
call
it
a
day
your
your
responses
are
fine
he
takes
off
the
targets
puts
them
down
picks
up
a
bottle
of
water
the
bot
stands
in
place
and
watches
him
giles
turns
back
and
sees
her
looking
at
him
perhaps
anya's
right
perhaps
i
am
trying
to
teach
you
as
if
you
were
human
giles
uncomfortable
yes
i
like
your
teachings
every
slayer
needs
her
watcher
i'm
not
so
sure
about
that
buffybot
frowns
what
do
you
mean
nothing
giles
wipes
his
face
with
a
towel
looks
at
the
bot
again
sighs
giles
looking
away
i
just
can't
help
but
wonder
if
she
would
have
been
better
off
without
me
buffy
i
don't
think
that's
true
you
were
very
helpful
to
her
giles
laughs
right
yes
i
was
a
perfect
watcher
i
did
what
any
good
watcher
would
do
got
my
slayer
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
oh
that
wasn't
your
fault
of
course
not
that's
how
all
slayerwatcher
relationships
end
isn't
it
he
puts
his
glasses
on
turns
to
face
the
bot
again
calmer
now
she's
gone
i
did
my
job
buffybot
frowns
innocently
well
then
why
are
you
still
here
giles
looks
at
her
sadly
cut
to
demons
on
motorcycles
they
drive
up
to
a
large
building
with
a
lot
of
other
motorcycles
parked
outside
loud
rock
music
cut
to
inside
it's
a
bar
many
large
muscular
leatherclad
demons
are
walking
around
drinking
beer
etc
several
of
them
wear
leather
jackets
with
the
word
hellion
on
the
back
there
are
also
some
humans
pan
across
to
the
bar
so
i
got
her
cornered
in
this
alley
see
we
see
the
vamp
who
injured
the
buffybot
he
sits
at
the
bar
talking
to
one
of
the
leather
demons
mag
mag
skeptical
you
get
the
slayer
cornered
yeah
i
figured
it's
my
duty
she's
a
menace
to
our
society
so
we
fight
and
i'm
like
pow
pow
pow
vamp
makes
punching
gestures
and
i
got
her
on
the
ropes
mag
turns
and
grabs
him
by
the
throat
growling
you're
lying
to
me
vamp
high
choked
voice
i
swear
on
all
that's
unholy
you
haven't
even
heard
the
best
part
i
cut
her
right
and
she's
i
don't
know
some
kind
of
machine
she's
not
human
mag
looks
into
his
eyes
for
a
moment
lets
him
go
you're
high
i'm
tellin'
you
it
wasn't
even
the
slayer
man
it
was
like
a
trick
vamp
mag
looks
at
him
a
robot
the
vamp
starts
to
drink
his
beer
but
mag
grabs
him
again
and
hustles
him
across
the
room
he
pushes
through
the
crowd
of
demons
to
where
the
head
demon
razor
is
sitting
in
a
booth
surrounded
by
his
cronies
razor
is
very
large
and
ugly
what's
with
the
blood
rat
mag
to
the
vampire
talk
vamp
nervous
okay
uh
so
i
was
over
in
sunnydale
minding
my
own
beeswax
when
i
see
the
slayer
mag
vamp
shakes
him
the
part
about
the
robot
we
fought
right
and
i
was
like
all
over
her
vamp
punching
gestures
boom
boom
boom
he
says
the
slayer's
been
replaced
by
some
kind
of
machine
the
vamp
stops
making
punch
noises
razor
looks
interested
a
robot
yeah
and
i
kicked
her
synthetic
ass
you
shoulda
seen
the
sparks
razor
gets
up
towers
over
the
vamp
you
tellin'
me
there's
no
slayer
in
sunnydale
longer
shot
of
them
from
across
the
room
other
demons
watching
that's
what
i'm
saying
they
got
some
kind
of
decoy
standing
in
for
her
vamp
false
bravado
town
is
wide
open
nowhere
like
the
hellmouth
for
a
party
there's
all
kinds
of
bad
in
that
place
razor
nods
thoughtfully
he
and
his
cronies
all
laugh
the
vamp
laughs
too
pats
razor
on
the
chest
i
guess
with
your
muscle
uh
you
could
own
it
in
no
time
vamp
nervous
chuckle

the
gang

let
me
go
razor
grabs
him
by
the
neck
shot
of
the
vamp's
headless
body
hitting
the
floor
and
dusting
razor
brushes
dust
off
his
hands
i'll

it
over

looks
around
all
his
demon
buddies

watching

ride
they
all
cheer

in
on
a
wrinkled
desiccated
hand
pan
up
across
a
body
encased
in
black
clothing
the
orange
mist
from
before
swirls
around
the
head
which
is
a
skull
with
much
of
the
skin
rotting
off
and
the
hair
decaying
as
the
mist
moves
around
the
body
the
eyeballs
reappear
the
skin
and
hair
repair
themselves
and
it
resolves
into
buffy
wideeyed
and
gasping
she's
inside
her
coffin
she
looks
around
panting
with
an
expression
of
extreme
fear
blackout
