by

his
voice
turns
scratchy
—thing

i'm
the
slayer
you
don't
want
to
get
into

it
so
—
vampire
is
charging
dawn
she
bends
and
flips
him
over
her
back
—use
that
perfect
dawn
stakes
him
and
thinks
she
defeated
him
but
she
missed
the
heart
she
gets
a
panicked
look
on
her
face
he
pushes
dawn
down
gets
up
and
away
from
her
she
tries
again
to
stake
him
but
he
overpowers
her
and
starts
to
bite
her
neck
buffy
buffy
grabs
the
vampire's
coat
from
behind
and
he
drops
dawn
buffy
fights
with
swings
kicks
punches
etc
finally
she
grabs
a
nearby
sword
and
cuts
off
his
head
it's
real
it's
the
only
lesson
dawn
it's
always
real
let
me
see
she
inspects
dawn's
neck
there
are
two
puncture
wounds
where
the
vampire
bit
her
it's
nothing
it's
just
a
scrape
plus
i
had
a
plan
the
whole
time
really
yeah
i
planned
to
get
killed
come
back
as
a
vampire
and
bite
you
you
wanted
to
be
trained
well
just
the
next
time
when
you're
gonna
disa—
you
did
pretty
well
i
did
yeah
'cause
you
know
with
the
whole
rolling
thing
i
was
actually
using
his
strength
and
it
was
very
tai
chi
plus
i
nearly
got
the
heart
my
first
time
out
i
missed
the
heart
too
no
way
just
the
once
buffy
walks
back
to
pack
up
her
tools
and
weapons
they
begin
walking
home
well
the
next
vampire
i
meet—
the
next
vampire
you
meet
you
run
away
i
just
wish
that
was
all
we
had
to
worry
about
vampires
demons
they're
nothing
compared
to
what's
coming
i
know
i
just
can't
believe
it's
back
believe
me
i
thought
i
was
long
past
it
i
guess
you
never

a
few
more

of
sunnydale's

xander

i
lined
up
the
plans
new

old
and
right
exactly
where
the
library
was
we

so
the
principal's
evil
or
in
a
boatload
of
danger
well
the
last
two

were
eaten
who
would
even
apply
for
that
job
guess
we'll
see
ooh

have
to
leave
though
you
have
everything
books

a
great
personality
but
busy
making
out
with
your
dead
boyfriend
while
i
was
ripped
to
death
by
a
werewolf
dead

that
why
you
let

who's
for
finding
out
why
dead
nerd
lunges
at
buffy
who
pushes
him
out

jumps
on
her
back
and
buffy
falls
back
to
the
ground
to
knock
her
off
when
buffy
gets
up
she
thought
she
had
taken
them
all
out
but
suddenly
all
three
dead
people
are
standing
in

again
like
they
reappeared
there
supernaturally
if
at
first
you
don't
succeed

leaps
over
them

they
jump
her

carlos
you

gonna
be
ok
school
is
intense
but
you'll
do
all
right
as
long
as
you're
careful
and
you
might
want
to
think
about
sticking
together
thank
you
kit

still
have
a
few
more

to
live
through

kisses
buffy
on
the
cheek
and
walks
away
with
her
friends
the
principal
walks
up
to
buffy
curiouser
and
curiouser
what
is
carlos
trejo
and
kit
holburn
right
possibly
the
only
two
students
in
this
school
whose
files
are
as
thick
as
yours
was
you
really
did
your
homework
didn't
you
i
was
looking
for
one
or
both
of
them
to
actually
implode
in
a
fearsome
way
right
before
midterms
and
now
i
see
that
you
got
'em
socializing
and
hugging
and
actually
if
i'm
not
mistaken
headed
to
class
well
we
shared
an
encounter
look
i
know
you're
probably
more
than
happy
to
get
out
of
this
place
but
i
gotta
tell
you
miss
summers
i
think
you
belong
here
hmm
new
listen
i
know
this
school's
reputation
what
you
think
i
got
this
job
based
on
seniority
we
got
a
lot
of
troubled
students
here
and
just
enough
money
to
keep
this
place
from
caving
in
yeah
you
might
need
a
little
extra
there
well
we
do
have
a
community
outreach
program
and
the
money
we
could
pay
you
wouldn't
even
fold
but
it
would
just
be
a
couple
of
days
a
week
are
you
asking
me
to
be
a
counselor
well
we
have
a
guidance
counselor
but
i
was
thinking
the
kids
could
use
someone
you
know
closer
to
their
age
who
still—
i'm
in
what
you
serious
you—you
did
hear
the
part
about
the
money
right
yeah
i
heard
my
schedule
might
be
a
little
funtastic
but
uh
i'll
work
it
out
i'd
like
to
keep
an
eye
on
this
place
well
that's
great
look
at
that
it's
not
even
noon
and
i've
already
bullied
my
first
family
member
into
helping
out
i'm
going
to
be
the
best
principal
ever
principal
walks
away
buffy
looks
pleased
like
maybe
things
will
work
out
after
all
cut
to
40
int
basement
sunnydale
high
day
back
in
the
room
where
spike
was
he's
still
crouched
down
on
the
floor
on
his
tiptoes
hugging
his
knees
he
looks
vulnerable
like
he's
in
there
with
someone
or
something
dangerous
the
thing
isi
had
a
speech
i
learned
it
all
oh
god
she
won't
understand
she
won't
understand
warren
is
circling
spike
addressing
him
as
spike
cowers
in
the
middle
of
the
room
of
course
she
won't
understand
sparky
i'm
beyond
her
understanding
she's
a
girl
sugar
and
spice
and
everythinguseless
unless
you're
baking
i'm
more
than
that
more
than
flesh
warren
morphs
into
glory
who
is
still
pacing
and
talking
to
spike
more
than
blood
i'm
you
know
i
honestly
don't
think
there's
a
human
word
fabulous
enough
for
me
oh
my
name
will
be
on
everyone's
lips
assuming
their
lips
haven't
been
torn
off
but
not
just
yet
that's
alright
though
glory
morphs
into
adam
apparently
this
monster
is
something
that
can
change
shape
and
impersonate
other
characters
the
morphing
monster
is
still
pacing
i
can
be
patient
everything
is
well
within
parameters
she's
exactly
where
i
want
her
to
be
and
so
are
you
number
17
you're
right
where
you
belong
morphing
monster
changes
to
the
mayor
and
bends
down
on
one
knee
to
talk
to
spike
at
eyelevel
so
what'd
you
think
you'd
get
your
soul
back
and
everything'd
be
jim
dandy
soul's
slipperier
than
a
greased
weasel
why
do
you
think
i
sold
mine
first
the
mayor
laughs
well
you
probably
thought
that
you'd
be
your
own
man
and
i
respect
that
but
first
drusilla
touching
spike's
face
you
never
will
you'll
always
be
mine
you'll
always
be
in
the
dark
with
me
singing
our
little
songs
you
like
our
little
songs
don't
you
you've
always
liked
them
right
from
the
beginning
and
that's
where
we're
going
first
the
master
stands
right
back
to
the
beginning
not
the
bang
not
the
word
the
true
beginning
the
next
few
months
are
going
to
be
quite
a
ride
and
i
think
we're
all
going
to
learn
something
about
ourselves
in
the
process
you'll
learn
you're
a
pathetic
schmuck
if
it
hasn't
sunk
in
already
look
at
you
trying
to
do
what's
right
just
like
her
you
still
don't
get
it
it's
not
about
right
not
about
wrong
morphing
monster
walks
around
behind
spike
and
when
it
reappears
it
has
transformed
into
buffy
as
buffy
it
is
standing
with
arms
crossed
in
front
with
a
smug
and
serious
look
on
her
face
glaring
at
spike
it's
about
power
