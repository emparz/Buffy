not
starting
up
again
with
the
whole—
no
a
thousand
gallons
of
no
ok
it's
just—things
are
different
now—he
has
a
soul
i'm
sure
that'll
be
a
real
comfort
when
he
soulfully
attacks
you
again
yeah
what
does
that
mean
exactly—that
spike
is
all
soulhaving
i
don't
know
but
he's
been
through
a
lot
ok
and
nobody's
attacking—
spike
walks
forward
and
touches
buffy's
arm
she's
startled
buffy—
sorry
no
it's
me
ii
just—
i'll
go
this
can't
work
it
will
iit
already
is
ok
you
know
you've
been
out
of
the
basement
for
half
an
hour
and
you've
already
stopped
talking
to
invisible
people
bollocks
ok
so
there
was
that
one
episode
in
the
car
but—
no
bollocks
to
the
whole
thing
i
don't
need
your
mollycoddling

of
pity
what
is
it
it's
a
good
question

what
exactly
buffy
shakes
her
head
dawn
no
i'm—i'm
just
trying
to
understand
i

none
of
it
makes
sense
first
you
say
spike
disgusts
you
but
secretly
you
two
are
doing
it
like
bunnies
and
then
spike
says
he'd
die
for
you
but
he
tries
to
rape
you
buffy
sighs
for
the
record
spike
knew
how
wrong
it
was
that's
why
he
went
away
but
to
get
a
soul
like
that
would
make
him
a
better
man
xander
had
a
soul
when
he
stood
anya
up
at
the
altar
and
now
he
says
he
still
wants
her
i
just
don't
think
it's
the
school
basement
that's
making
people
crazy
buffy

should
really
get
back
you
comin'

then
douses
his
face
with
water
from

and
walks
off
she's
watching

then
he
fell
why

he
say

just
embarrassed
it's
hard
being
clumsy
especially
when
you're
popular
and
athletic
i'd
bet
yeah
well
to
be
candid
it
wouldn't
be
the
first

lie
it'd
be

start
to
feel
really
bad
about
leaving

buffy
turns
away
hands
up
to
avoid
the
conversation
aah
no
more
with
the
talky
look
i
know
how
guys
like
you
work
you
turn
on
the
charm
you
get
whatever
you
want
no
matter
who
gets
in
your
way
right
rj
stands
ok

not
like
that
rj
starts
putting
on

i
just—
rj
buffy
pushes
him
back
into
the

along
buffy
turns
to
pace
while
she
rants
oh

i'm
mr
quarterback
buffy
while
buffy's
facing
away
rj
finishes
putting
on
his
jacket
i
crush
little
girls
and
all
their
little
feelings
all
i
have
to
do
is—
buffy
turns
facing
him
now
and
suddenly
changes
to
a
more
pleasant
tone
lead
a
team
of
high
school
athletes
trying
their
best
to
do
a
good
job
everyone
depending
on
me
that
is
a
lot
of
pressure
but
it
doesn't
mean
you
get
to
disregard
other
people's
feelings
it's
not
like
i
meant
to
hurt
anyone
i
know
buffy
sits
on
table
beside
rj
i
know
that
it's
just—
you're
a
leader
a
captain
ok
people
look
up
to
you
you
need
to
keep
that
in
mind
when
you—
buffy
distracted
by
looking
at
his
body
i
bet
you
run
a
lot
huh
i
mean
they
work
you
pretty
hard
don't
they
yeah
rj

i
was
there
when
i
was
still
in
high
school
which
i
was
just
a
couple
of
years
ago

you
know
i
just
realized
buffy
blushing
that
i'm
basically
the
same
age
as
you
i'm
not
really
older
at
all
actually
just
like
you
buffy
making
eyes
at
him
but
with
the
sexual
experience
and
stuff
i
think
i
hear
what
you're
saying
a
colleague
comes
into
the
office
lobby
area
buffy
stands
and
clears
her
throat
changing
the
tone
of
her
conversation
to
seem
more
professional
um
right
i'm—i'm
really
glad
that
wwe
had
this
talk
so
uh
i
think
you'd
better
to

leaves

so
what's
it
like
to
lead
a

thing
of
it
is
the
time
nobody
gets
how
much
time
goes
into
it
with
practices
and
games
i
totally
get
it
i
was
kinda
juggling
some
stuff
when
i
was
in

too—which
was
also
very
recent
principal
snyder
was
always
on

worst
you

seen
the
way
that
guy
rides
me

wish
somebody'd
get
him
off
my
back

would
be
cool
and
sometimes
i
didn't
even
do
anything
wrong—
buffy
grabs
him
by
the

kisses
him
passionately
they
kiss
for
a
moment
then
he
pulls
back
you're

he
used
to
stick
chewing
gum
in
my
hair
xander
willow
looks
horrified

was
complex
at
best
butmaybe
he's
a
way
in
buffy
to
willow
now
look
for
a
picture
cut
to
29
ext
neighborhood
street
night
standing
in
front
of
someone's
house
xander's
talking
to
spike
who
seems
a
bit
uncomfortable
i'm
just
saying
we're—we're
tangling
with
a
powerful
spell
here
xander
they
walk
up
to
the
house
we
don't
know
what
the
deal
is
so—so
keep
an
eye
out
if
this
guy
looks
twitchy
and
don't
let
this
guy
charm
you
either
he
had
everyone
around
him
practically
kissing
his
ring
back
in
high
school
they're
standing
on
the
front
porch
now
ringing
the
doorbell
an
angel
decorates
the
door
jamb
and
spike
avoids
its
glare
a
tall
ungroomed
unathletic
guy
answers
the
door
in
a
pizza
delivery
uniform
xander
and
spike
both
stare
at
him
in
disbelief
yeah
cut
to

home
night
the
brother
is
sitting
slouched
in
an
overstuffed
chair
xander
and

are
sitting
across
from
him
on
the
couch
the
room's
lovingly
decorated
with
pale
ivory
colors
soft
lighting
and
lace
and
there
are
knickknacks
everywhere
each
guy
is
drinking
a
bottle
of
beer
construction

what's
up
with
rj
how's
he
doing
at
the
old
alpha
mater
good

xander
spike
stands
and
starts
walking
around
the
room
i
know
a
girl
that
might
be
going
out
with
him
and
i
was
wondering—
god
and
you
want
to
know
if
he's
a
good
guy
truth
is
he's
the
best
following
in
my
footsteps
you
might
not
know
it
now
looking
at
me
with
a
couple
of
extra
pounds
but
back
then
i
was
quite
the
guy
spike's
standing
at
the
back
of
the
room
now
near
a
curio
cabinet
full
of
statuettes
yeah
i
gather
that
rj
is
pretty
popular
too
i
gotta
tell
ya
there
was
a
time
i
was
worried
about
rj
he
was
into
comic
books
model
un
geek
stuff—no
offense
harris
while
the
brother's
talking
spike's
inspecting
the
figurines
on
the
curio
cabinet
they're
all
angels
dozens
and
dozens
of
angels
he
starts
turning
them
around
where
they're
not
facing
him
anymore
one
time
i
found
all
this
poetry
under
his
bed
turns
out
he
wrote
it
then
he
uh—what
do
you
call
it
blossomed
that's
what
it
was
like
spike's
still
walking
around
the
room
looking
at
things
and
do
you
have
any
idea
why
he
you
know
burst
into
a
flower
all
of
a
sudd—
standing
in
front
of
the
mantle
spike's
looking
at
