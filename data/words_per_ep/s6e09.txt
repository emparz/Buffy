and
kicks
one
of
the
men
he
stumbles
back
drops
the
purse
he
and
his
cohort
stare
at
buffy
in
fear
we
see
that
they're
human
not
vampires
buffy
surprised
wow
a
mugging
haven't
gotten
one
of
those
in
a
while
the
uninjured
mugger
checking
to
make
sure
the
one
buffy
kicked
is
okay
usually
it's
blood
and
with
the
horror
just
a
good
oldfashioned
mugging
buffy
the
victims
staring
at
her
kinda
sweet
actually
buffy
bends
over
picks
up
the
woman's
purse
oh
uh
probably
not
for
you
here
buffy
gives
the
woman
her
purse
go
now
the
husband
and
wife
run
off
one
of
the
muggers
attacks
buffy
and
she
blocks
his
punch
punches
him
then
grabs
his
arm
and
twists
it
around
behind
him
she
holds
him
there
while
she
kicks
the
other
one
back
not
too
sweet
for
you
either
huh
buffy
mugger
getting
up
but
come
on
rush
me
it'll
be
funny
the
second
mugger
gets
up
and
is
about
to
rush
her
when
spike
comes
into
the
shot
yelling
yaah
no
spike
punches
the
mugger
and
falls
into
a
pile
of
boxes
buffy
lets
go
of
the
mugger
she's
holding
and
he
runs
off
spike
rolls
around
in
the
pile
of
boxes
clutching
his
head
in
pain
boxes
fall
on
top
of
him
the
other

remind

you
more
often
hey
little
sympathy
for
the
man
with
the
migraine
here
can
we
well
that's
what
you
get
for
attacking
a
human
yeah
spike
annoyed
you'd
think
if
the
government
was
gonna
put
a
chip
in
my
head
they'd
at
least
make
it
so
i
could
attack
criminals
and
that
sort
yes
because
muggers
deserve
to
be
eaten
spike
gives
her
a
sour
look
just
have
to
get
your
rocks
off
fightin'
demons

suggestively
there
are
other
ways

to
that
an
extreme
'see

she
turns

smirks
walks
after
her
buffy

i

open
in
a
museum
night
a
person
dressed
all
in
black
descends
from
the
domed
ceiling
on
a
thin
wire
Ã 
la
tom
cruise
in
mission
impossible
he
stops
hovering
beside
a
display
case
in
the
center
of
the
room
cut
closer
we
see
that
it's
andrew
wearing
all
black
clothes
and
a
black
beret
and
a
small
microphone
headset
he
attaches
a
small
metal
device
to
the
side
of
the
display
case
warren
and
jonathan
walk
up
beside
him
dude

not
breaking
into
langley
here
it's
sunnydale
well
you
never
know
what
new
stuff
they
have
better
safe
than
okay
the
security
system
here
is
a
guy
named
rusty
warren
gives
andrew
a
shove
so
that
he
starts
spinning
headoverheels
in
the
air
he
spins
a
few
times
before
managing
to
stop
himself
warren
and
jonathan
grin
now
get
up
whoa
head
rush
cool
andrew
grins
disconnects
himself
from
the
wires
guys
come
on
quit
jerking
around
warren
walks
over
to
the
display
case
we
see
that
he
has
a
small
gas
tank
strapped
to
his
back
he
removes
the
device
that
andrew
attached
to
the
glass
tosses
it
over
his
shoulder
jonathan
catches
it
warren
produces
a
small
blowtorch
and
begins
cutting
the
glass
see
that's
cool
how
come
he
gets
to
play
with
all
the
cool
stuff
because
i'm
allergic
to
methane
and
you're
still
afraid
of
hot
things
andrew
pouty
i
know
besides
the
tank
kept
making
both
of
us
tip
over
remember
warren
has
finished
cutting
a
hole
in
the
glass
he
knocks
out
the
round
piece
of
glass
reaches
in
and
grabs
a
large
diamond
from
the
case
he
turns
to
the
others
got
it
it's
beautiful
boys
congratulations
phase
one
of
the
plan
is
now
complete
let's
get
the
hell
outta
here
they
turn
to
go
but
are
confronted
by
an
older
man
in
a
security
uniform
what
are
you
boys
doing
um
we're
with
a
tour
group
warren
pauses
the
getthefreezeray
tour
group
musta
gotten
separated
museum
closed
five
hours
ago
really
uhhuh
huh
guess
we
just
lost
track
of
time
we
should
probably
get
the
freeze
ray
out
of
here
now
warren
pauses
waiting
for
the
others
to
pick
up
on
his
subtle
cue
but
they
don't
he
turns
to
glare
at
jonathan
jonathan
and
andrew
finally
clue
in
turn
their
backs
to
rusty
and
dig
in
a
bag
that
jonathan's
carrying
'cause
we
love
the
learning
rusty
warren
walking
closer
to
rusty
museums
libraries
disney
hall
of
presidents
not
boring
but
more
to
the
point
goodbye
warren
makes
a
kissing
motion
at
rusty
and
backs
up
jonathan
points
a
large
gunlike
device
at
rusty
and
fires
ice
shoots
out
of
it
and
encases
rusty
completely
immobilizing
him
warren
excited
dude
that
is
so
cool
warren
walks
closer
to
rusty
the
freeze
ray
totally
worked
we
see
that
jonathan's
arm
holding
the
freezeray
is
also
encased
in
ice
yeah
uh
not
exactly
warren
still
gazing
at
rusty
so
there's
a
kink
or
two
it's
just
a
prototype
i
mean
soon
we'll
have
hey
that's
really
neato
and
stuff
but
in
the
meantime
you
know
ow
warren
glances
at
him
be
a
bigger
wuss
can
we
just
go
back
to
the
lair
because
i
can't
really
feel
my
fingers
yeah
yeah
come
on
jonathan
and
andrew
walk
on
past
warren
andrew
pauses
looking
at
rusty
is
he
gonna
like
oh
he'll
be
fine
yeah
he'll
defrost
in
a
couple
of
days
no
harm
no
foul
won't
he
tell
on
us
and
say
what
'two
guys
and
a
mime
took
me
out
with
their
freeze
ray'
that's
likely
andrew
looks
uncertain
come
on
they
walk
off
leaving
rusty
standing
there
with
bits
of
mist
curling
off
him
cut
to
the

backhands
spike
and
he
goes
down
he
gets
up
to
a
kneeling
position
with
his
back
to
buffy
and
stays
there
looking
at
the
ground
she
speaks
to
his
back

a
thing

evil
disgusting
thing
she
walks
past
him
and
away
spike
lifts
his
head
to
watch
her
go
slowly
an
evil
grin
spreads
across
his
face
blackout
act
ii

open
on
the
street
downtown
night
people
walking
around
talking
etc
spike
walks
out
from
an
alley
looks
around
grins
pan
across
the
street
lots
of
people
going
about
their
business
spike
to
himself
look
at
all
the
goodies
he
continues
looking
around
pauses
as
he
spots
something
closer
shot
of
a
young
blonde
woman
standing
on
the
corner
looking
at
her
watch
looking
around
hugging
herself
as
if
she's
cold
she
turns
and
starts
to
walk
away
spike
moves
to
follow
her
cut
to
an
alley
the
young
woman
walks
along
still
hugging
herself
looking
nervous
suddenly
spike
steps
out
in
front
of
her
she
screams
that's
right
you
should
scream
she
tries
to
get
away
but
he
moves
to
intercept
her
she
looks
scared
creature
of
the
night
here
yeah
spike
indicating
himself
some
people
forget
that
he
advances
on
the
woman
she
backs
away
shaking
her
head
fearfully
backs
up
against
a
wall
please
she
thinks
i'm
housebroken
she
forgot
who
she's
dealing
with
anything
you
want
please
just
'cause
she's
confused
about
where
she
fits
in
i'm
supposed
to
be
too
'cause
i'm
not
spike
pacing
back
and
forth
i
know
what
i
am
i'm
dangerous
i'm
evil
woman
scared
ii'm
sure
you're
not
evil
yes
i
am
i
am
a
killer
spike
moves
closer
to
her
that's
what
i
do
i
kill
and
yeah
maybe
it's
been
a
long
time
but
it's
not
like
you
forget
how
he
gets
up
very
close
to
the
woman
who
is
panting
fearfully
you
just
do
it
spike
nervously
and
now
i
can
again
all
right
so
here
goes
he
morphs
into
vamp
face
the
woman
screams
this
might
hurt
a
little
he
bends
over
to
bite
her
then
flings
himself
back
yelling
in
pain
crashes
into
a
dumpster
the
woman
runs
off
spike
crouches
there
clutching
the
dumpster
panting
what
the
hell
is
going
on
cut
to
an
outdoor
cafe
day
dawn
sits
drinking
from
a
very
large
chocolate
milkshake
as

laugh
dawn
continues
drinking
her
milkshake
the

their
coach
a
valuable
lesson
you
know
that
i
will
always
be
there
for
you
right
tara
dawn
looks
at
her

smiling
there
there

actually
more
of
a
leadin
when
i
practiced
that
at
home
i
know
it's
just
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
my
moving
out
had
nothing
to
do
with
you

i
i
will
never
stop
loving
you

love
her
very
much
i
just
sometimes
other
things
get
in
the
way
i
know
dawn
nervously
uh
she's
been
doing
a
lot
better
lately
though
uh
she's
been
really
good
about
being
careful
aabout
stuff
well
good
great
that's
that's
great
cut
to
the
magic
shop
willow
xander
and
buffy
sit
around
the
round
table
anya
stands
by
the
bookshelves
in
background
here
says
the
guard's
definitely
gonna
live
xander
reading
newspaper
he's
all
thawed
out
says

used
hairdryers
huh
shot
of
the
newspaper
with
an
article
headline
reading
museum
guard
attacked
frozen
body
thawed
remains
unconscious
everything
slowed
down
his
nervous
system
circulatory
system
he's
still
unconscious
anya
makes
a
whiny
noise
anya
it's
such
a
pain
the
text
i
wanted
giles
took
it
with
him
he
has
this
thing
that
owning
a
book
makes
it
like
his
property
what
should
we
do
should
we
call
him
it's
like
the
middle
of
last
night
there
buffy
frowns
or
maybe
it's
tomorrow
anyone
remember
how
that
works
that's
okay
no
one
freak
we'll
just
do
it
another
way
willow
reaches
for
her
bag
ii
don't
think
we
need
to
resort
to
i
mean
willow
pulls
out
her
laptop
computer
and
sets
it
on
the
table
oh
hey
cool
all
right
back
to
basics
a
little
oldfashioned
stateoftheart
hacker
action
that's
great
will
i
haven't
seen
you
do
that
in
a
long
time
willow
puts
her
hands
over
the
keyboard
not
touching
it
the
keyboard
glows
with
a
pale
yellow
light
buffy
to
xander
ii
don't
remember
that
part
buffy
buffy
and
xander
staring
at
willow
willow
staring
blankly
in
front
of
her
it's
quicker
it'll
just
take
me
a
sec
to
go
through
the
files
okay
internal
police
report
buffy
and
xander
exchange
a
concerned
look
a
diamond
was
stolen
from
the
museum
last
night
a
big
one
on
loan
from
the
british
museum
they're
withholding
information
to
smoke
out
the
criminals
oh
it's
pretty
willow
looks
at
buffy
smiles
there's
a
picture
well
is
it
a
a
supernatural
diamond
you
know
like
healing
powers
or
or
goodlucky
maybe
it's
cursed
diamonds
are
excellent
for
cursing
willow
again
staring
blankly
well
we'll
keep
checking
shall
we
xander
awkwardly
well
you
know
i
am
kinda
beat
and
i
bet
you
that's
tiring
that
thing
you're
doing
there
xander
fake
yawn
xander
gives
an
exaggerated
stretch
as
if
to
show
he's
tired
willow
takes
her
hands
off
the
keyboard
sound
effect
to
indicate
the
end
of
her
spell
she
looks
at
them
guys
i'm
fine
what's
the
deal
with
oh
for
crying
out
loud
this
is
bizarre
you're
all
'la
la
la'
with
with
the
magic
and
the
not
talking
like
everything's
normal
when
we
all
know
that
tara
up
and
left
you
and
now
everyone's
scared
to
say
anything
to
you
anya
pauses
smiles
except
me
anya
looks
at
xander
is
this
that
thing
i
do
that
you
were
commenting
anya
xander
nods
guys
it's
okay
it's
hard
but
iit's
better
this
way
little
things
just
starting
taking
over
things
that
didn't
matter
but
we
saw
them
differently
so
they
got
blown
out
of
proportion
willow
shot
of
buffy
and
xander
listening
and
this
time
away
will
help
us
sort
through
things
really
now
let's
just
keep
working
on
this
i
don't
wanna
leave
amy
alone
in
the
house
so
long
amy
is
she
how
is
she
adjusting
it's
hard
to
say
it's
a
lot
to
take
in
i
keep
expecting
her
to
do
like
ratty
stuff
you
know
licking
her
hands
clean
shredding
newspaper
leaving
little
pellets
in
the
corner
let's
definitely
not
leave
her
alone
in
the
house
too
long
cut
to
close
shot
of
the

makes
colors
with
the
light

the
geeks
stare
in
alarm

comes
down
into
their

back
up

his
hands
behind
his
head
and
numerous
wires
attached
to
his
head
warren
moves
the
device
over
spike's
head
pan
across
the
table
to
reveal
a
book
open
to
a
page
that
shows
a
diagram
of
the
human
brain
there's
also
a
disconnected
robot
arm
cut
to
later
andrew

and
spike
sit
in
chairs
sidebyside
on
a
slightly
raised
platform

frowns
at
him
suspiciously

through
on
a
steady
pulse

in
warren's
face

over
him
on
the
platform
very
menacing
if
you're
lying
to
me
no
it's
all
right
here
i
i
mean
it
is
it's
really
not
that
hard
to
figure
out
if
you
just
warren
sees
spike
frowning
what
spike
frowns
ponders
deeply
gives
a
small
smile
looks
at
warren
you
tell
anyone
about

i
promise
who
would
i
tell
i
don't
even
know

about
the
rules
having
changed
spike
steps
down
from

off
to
the
dance
floor

dancing
together
willow
stands
watching
i'm
getting
caught
in
the
corners
of
her
vermilion
borders
she's
moving
backwards
and
forwards
and
she's
ugly
when
she's
insecure
cut
to
later
willow
sits
by
herself
staring
at
a
martini
glass
she
lifts
out
the
plastic
stirrer
with
an
olive
speared
on
it
close
shot
of
the
olive
with
its
pimento
filling

it's
the
gullet
for
you
mister
she
eats
the
olive
amy
comes
rushing
over
hey
sorry
i
kinda
got
caught
up
amy
drinks
from
another
martini
no
it's
okay
amy
puts
down
her
glass
ponders
you
know
if
rats
could
dance
they
probably
wouldn't
gnaw
so
much
willow
smiles
and
nods
the
two
guys
walk
over
again
hey
come
on
we're
just
getting
started
amy
looks
at
willow
i
think
i'm
gonna
sit
this
one
out
nuhuh
you
can't
you
can't
just
work
us
up
like
that
and
then
just
the
guy
grabs
amy's
arm
and
pulls
her
away
from
the
bar
but
she
pulls
free
hey
i
think
she
said
no
well
nobody
asked
you
ellen
the
two
guys
snicker
amy
and
willow
exchange
a
look
then
look
at
the
guys
again
you
wanna
dance
that's
all
nice
slow
relaxing
dance
amy
and
willow
exchange
another
look
shrug
and
both
gesture
at
the
guys
magical
specialeffect
shoots
from
their
hands
to
the
two
guys
willow's
specialeffect
is
dark
orange
amy's
green
suddenly
the
two
guys
disappear
and
reappear
in
dancecages
above
the
dance
floor
they
each
wear
just
a
skimpy
loincloth
they
both
begin
to
dance
although
their
faces
look
shocked
and
appalled
willow
and
amy
watch
with
small
smiles
gee
i
think
i
do
feel
more
relaxed
cut
to
the
magic
shop
buffy
xander
and
anya
sit
around
the
table
looking
at
books
aha
i
got
it
uh
here's
our
villain
right
here
anya
and
buffy
look
then
both
shake
their
heads
buffy
returns
to
her
book
what
that's
a
dd
manual
sweetie
no
but
it
could
xander
looks
at
the
book
cover
laughs
weakly
oh
let's
face
it
we're
not
gonna
find
this
thing
because
it
doesn't
exist
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
frost
monster
who
eats
diamonds
well
maybe
he
doesn't
eat
them
you
know
maybe
he
just
thinks
they're
pretty
she
nods
hopefully
for
a
moment
then
stops
makes
a
face
slams
her
book
shut
we
suck
we
need
new
brains
what's
up
with
willow
out
with
amy
i
guess
great
someone
to
do
more
magic
with
but
at
least
she's
not
all
cooped
up
and
crying
that's
forward
momentum
now
i
know
that
i
don't
know
everything
that
happened
with
her
and
tara
but
it
tara
thinks
willow
is
doing
too
much
magic
and
she's
not
the
only
one
i
know
but
ii
think
she'll
be
fine
you
know
it's
it's
willow
she
of
the
level
head
well
those
are
the
ones
you
have
to
watch
out
for
the
most
responsible
types
right
she
might
go
crazy
and
start
alphabetizing
everything
i'm
serious
responsible
people
are
always
so
concerned
with
being
good
all
the
time
that
when
they
finally
get
a
taste
of
being
bad
they
can't
get
enough
it's
like
all
anya
gestures
kablooey
that's
not
true
okay
not
kablooey
more
like
bam
it's
human
nature
buff
will's
getting
a
taste
of
something
powerful
way
bigger
than
her
yeah
she
was
getting
out
of
control
with
it
before
tara
left
and
now
that
she's
gone
it's
gotta
be
seductive
buffy
looks
up
in
alarm
at
the
word
'seductive'
her
eyes
widen
xander
os
just
giving
in
to
it
going
totally
wild
buffy
stares
at
him
we
need
to
keep
an
eye
on
her
okay
okay
we'll
we'll
keep
an
eye
but
we
can't
assume
that
everybody's
getting
seduced
you
know
sometimes
the
phone
rings
buffy
gets
up
to
answer
it
we
see
that
she's
wearing
a
gauzy
white
blouse
with
a
long
black
leather
skirt
she
goes
to
the
phone
at

chair
a
pile
of
bricks
in
the
corner

strides
into
the
room

looking
down
the
music
continues
various
people

floating
around
bolts
of
magic
randomly
turning
them
into
various
costumes
and
such
i
can't
find
the
time
and
place
to

they
stare
at
each
other
then
see
some
cute
girls
go
by
and
walk
off
in
pursuit

i
just
keep
thinking

be
someplace
like
bigger
than
this
overhead
shot
of
the
room

back
to
normal
with
people
dancing
and

too
early
to

buffy
pinned
against
the
stairs

chuckles
buffy
punches
him
he
punches

her
up
