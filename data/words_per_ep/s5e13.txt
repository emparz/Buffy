episode
begins

buffy
sitting
in
the
magic
shop
look
i
know
mom
wants
to
gather
and
make
with
the
merry
tomorrow
night
but
with
everything
that's
going
on
willow
walks
up
behind
buffy
this
is
exactly
what
you
need
willow
sits
next
to
buffy
we
see
tara
sitting
on
willow's
other
side
a
20th
birthday
party
with
with
with
presents
and
funny
hats
and
and
those
candles
that
don't
blow
out
willow
whispers
to
tara
those
used
to
scare
me
me
too
i
just
don't
think
this
is
the
best
time
to
break
out
the
party
pinata
we
need
to
stay
focused
if
we're
gonna
find
a
way
to
stop
glory
we
see
xander
and
anya
sitting
on
buffy's
other
side
we're
going
up
against
a
god
an
actual
mightierthanthou
god
well
you
know
what
they
say
the
bigger
they
are
anya
the
faster
they
stomp
you
into
nothing
everyone
looks
at
her
we
see
giles
sitting
between
buffy
and
xander
looking
through
books
and
papers
she's
right
i've
thrown
everything
i've
got
at
her
and
she
just
shrugs
it
off
then
we
have
to
find
something
heavier
to
throw
that
might
pose
some
difficulty
from
what
the
council's
been
able
to
discover
from
the
book
of
tarnis
and
and
and
other
sources
glory
and
two
of
her
fellow
hellgods
ruled
over
one
of
the
more
seriously
unpleasant
demon
dimensions
there's
more
than
one
oh
there
are
thousands
of
demon
dimensions
all
different
all
pushing
on
the
edges
of
our
reality
trying
to
find
a
way
in
i
guess
glory
found
one
the
question
is
why
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
here
just
vague
references
to
chaos
and
destruction
giles
sound
of
teakettle
whistling
giles
gets
up
to
get
it
okay
so
we
know
where
glory's
from
what
do
we
know
about
her
you
know
she's
tough
yeah
but
but
no
bolts
of
lightning
no
blasts
of
fire
shouldn't
a
god
be
able
to
do
that
kind
of
stuff
giles
pouring
tea
uh
usually
yes
but
um
being
in
human
form
must
be
severely
limiting
her
powers
all
we
have
to
worry
about
right
now
is
she's
immortal
invulnerable
and
insane
a
crazy
hellgod
and
the
fun
just
keeps
on
leaving
from
what
i've
been
able
to
gather
her
living
in
this
world
is
seriously
affecting
her
mental
state
as
well
she's
only
being
able
to
keep
her
mind
intact
by
uh
extracting
energy
from
us
well
from
from
the
human
brain
she
she
she's
a
brainsucker
tara
willow
and
tara
exchange
a
look
she
um

giles
leans
over
to
read
from
book
'absorbs
the
energies
that
bind
the
human
mind
into
a
cohesive
whole'
once
drained
all
that's
left
behind
is
uh
buffy
crazy
people
giles
pouring
more
tea
which
is
i'm
afraid
why
there's
been
a
marked
increase
in
the
ranks
of
the
mentally
unstable
here
in
sunnydale
at
least
vampires
just
kill
you
buffy
gets
up
we
have
to
find
a
way
to
stop
her
oh
well
tara
and
i
can
work
on
some
tactical
spells
willow
giles
hands
buffy
a
cup
of
tea
i
can
do
some
research
i
know
way
more
about
demon
dimensions
than
giles
does
anya
giles
frowns
well
i
do
this
is
great
longterm
plany
stuff
but
what
about
this
key
thingy
glory's
looking
for
buffy
and
giles
both
standing
sipping
tea
exchanging
a
look
tara
os
yeah
i
mean
shouldn't
we
be
trying
to
find
it
before
she
does
i
don't
think
that's
what
we
should
be
worrying
about
right
now
buffy
giles
sits
they've
got
a
point
whatever
glory's
planning
on
opening
with
the
key
i'm
guessing
it
won't
be
filled
with
candy
and
flowers
so
where
should
we
start
looking
do
we
know
where
it
used
to
be
kept
who
saw
it
last
we
did
giles
and
me
we
we
know
where
it
is
you
what
you
know
and
you
didn't
tell
us
there
were
reasons
look
iif
glory
knew
that
you
guys
knew
where
it
was
i

buffy
sits
ii
just
didn't
wanna
put
you
in
that
kind
of
danger
xander
annoyed
as
opposed
to
the
other
kind
we're
always
in
you
should
have
said
something
will
there
buffy
pauses
you're
right
buffy
to
giles
it's
time
are
you
sure
if
they're
gonna
be
risking
their
lives
they
deserve
to
know
know
what
buffy
looks
at
her
friends
they
look
at
her
there's
something
that
you
need
to
know
about
dawn
cut
to
graveyard
night
the
knight
from
'checkpoint'
orlando
holding
a
sword
the
link
must
be
severed
such
is
the
will
of
god
we
see
two
other
knights
standing
with
him
also
holding
swords
they
all
chant
in
unison
the
key
is
the
link
the
link
must
be
severed
such
is
the
will
of
god
the
key
is
the
link
the
link
must
be
severed
such
is
the
will
of
god
you
really
think
he
is
going
to
help
you
the
knights
draw
their
swords
and
turn
to
see
jinx
dreg
and
another
demon
who
looks
like
them
each
holding
an
axe
i
fear
your
faith
is
gravely
misplaced
the
demons
attack
the
fight
is
brief
two
of
the
demons
are
defeated
only
jinx
is
left
he
cowers
and
tries
to
back
away
as
orlando
advances
but
jinx
trips
over
something
and
falls
on
his
butt
orlando
stands
over
him
and
lifts
his
sword
high
shall
we
test
your
faith
now
he
starts
to
stab
downward
jinx
cringes
a
hand
appears
and
grabs
the
sword's
blade
never
send
a
minion
to
do
a
god's
work
she
backhands
orlando
who
goes
flying
backward
losing
his
grip
on
the
sword
he
crawls
toward
it
on
the
ground
as
glory
beats
up
the
other
two
knights
she
stabs
one
knight
with
his
own
sword
then
uses
it
to
kill
the
other
as
well
she
drops
the
sword
and
walks
toward
where
orlando
is
still
trying
to
reach
his
sword
hey
nice
sword
glory
picks
it
up
and
points
it
at
his
face
bet
it
hurts
wolf

up
around
your
house
cool
can
i
help
willow

black
arts
bumpin'
auras
with
the
littlest
summers
dawn
nods
resignedly
yeah
whatever
dawn
goes
into

she
not
be
real
she's
real
she's
just
kinda
new
willow
throws
a
last
handful
of
dust
down

flash
brightly
and
disappear

in
from

back
room
buffy
holds
a
bottle
of
water

carry
a
load
of
bricks

a
stake
made
of
butter

is
standing
with
a
notebook
lying
open
on
the
counter
giles

his
book
down
on
the

feels
that
way
about
her
schoolwork
sometimes
that
true
how
was
school
today
um
the
usual
big
square
building
filled
with
boredom
and
despair

buffy
softly
glory
is
evil
and
powerful
buffy

you're
getting
soft
in
your
advanced
age
she
didn't
look
that
tough
to
me
dawn
smirks
cut
to
glory
in
her
apartment
talking
to

circles
around
behind

just
between

and
you
our
itsybitsy
little
secret
glory
comes
back
to
the
front

his
face

her

down
his

around
him
hugging

rubbing
his
chest
shh

to
braid
hair
and
watch
teletubbies
with

looking
back
at
the
house

breaking
into
the
magic
shop

dawn
boastfully
to
steal
things
spike
frowns
magic
shop
eh
spike
looks
over
his
shoulder
thoughtfully
all
number
of
beasties
between
here
and
there
spike
dawn
looks
a
little
nervous
bet
they'd
really
go
for
a
little
red
riding
hood
like
you
bet
that
wouldn't
sit
too
well
with
big
sister
dawn
uncertain
i
can
take
care
of
myself
spike
just
looks
at
her
she
looks
around
anxious
you
wanna
come
steal
some
stuff
yeah
all
right
dawn
nods
they
walk
off
cut
to
exterior
magic
shop
night
dawn
stands
by
the
door
holding
the
chocolates
while
spike
kneels
trying
to
pick
the
lock
do
you
know
how
to
do
that
or
not
give
us
a
sec
i
usually
just
spike
gestures
burst
through
doors
the
door
finally
opens
that's
right
spike
stands
up
gives
dawn
his
best
smug
smirk
who's
bad
now
they
enter
girl
with
a
mission
eh
spike
dawn
turns
on
a
flashlight
what's
the
caper
jewels
ancient
artifacts
or
just
plain
hard
cash
liberated
from
the
till
a
book
all
this
for
a
book
dawn
walks
confidently
to
the
counter
puts
down
the
chocolates
and
goes
behind
the
counter
i
don't
want
the
book
just
what's
inside
i
think
it
was
giles'
notes
dawn
shines
the
flashlight
around
as
spike
examines
the
stuff
on
the
counter
he
was
standing
here
and
when
i
turned
around
it
was
gone
she
begins
feeling
under
the
counter
spike
takes
something
off
the
counter
and
puts
it
in
his
pocket
dawn
finds
the
hidden
drawer
and
pulls
it
open
revealing
the
book
she
smiles
in
triumph
cut
to
later
where
did
he
learn
to
write
so
bloody
small
from
a
fruit
fly
we
see
dawn
and
spike
sitting
on
the
floor
three
candles
lit
in
front
of
them
dawn
reading
the
book
spike's
cigarette
is
mostly
ash
wait
here's
something
uh
'tarnis
12th
century
one
of
the
founders
of
the
monks
of
the
order
of
dagon'
dawn
spike
stands
up
'their
sole
purpose
appears
to
have
been
as
protectors
of
the
key'
spike
dawn
scoffs
brownrobe
types
are
always
protecting
something
it's
the
only
way
they
can
justify
giving
up
girls
dawn
he
looks
around
spots
olaf's
hammer
from
'triangle'
in
a
display
case
hey
troll
hammer
spike
tries
to
pick
it
up
but
it's
too
heavy
it
falls
to
the
floor
with
a
clang
he
glances
over
to
see
if
dawn
noticed
she
has
her
back
to
him
didn't
go
with
my
stuff
anyway
he
continues
looking
around
at
the
shelves
looking
bored
as
dawn
reads
'the
key
is
not
directly
described
in
any
known
literature
but
all
research
indicates
an
energy
matrix
vibrating
at
a
dimensional
frequency
beyond
normal
human
perception
only
those
outside
reality
can
see
the
key's
true
nature'
dawn
shakes
head
outside
reality
what's
that
mean
mm
secondsight
blokes
mostly
spike
puts
out
his
cigarette
in
an
item
on
the
shelf
or
even
just
your
runofthemill
lunatics
he
resumes
his
seat
beside
dawn
as
she
begins
to
get
an
expression
of
revelation
flash
to
hospital
in
'listening
to
fear'
there
crazy
security
guard
points
at
a
scared
dawn
there's
no
one
in
there
flash
to
outside
magic
shop
in
'the
real
me'
i
know
what
you
are
back
to
dawn
looking
thoughtful
what
else
does
it
say
about
this
key
is
it
made
out
of
gold
maybe
we
can
hock
it
split
the
take
um
dawn
reads
'the
key
is
also
susceptible
to
necromanced
animal
detection
particularly
those
of
canine
or
serpent
construct'
flash
to
the
snake
creature
slithering
across
the
floor
in
'shadow'
dawn
screaming
as
it
rears
up
above
her
the
creature's
eyes
flashing
red
back
to
dawn
holding
the
book
pondering
spike
reaches
over
and
takes
the
book
from
her
spike
frowns
at
book
'the
monks
possessed
the
ability
to
transform
energy
bend
reality'
blah
blah
blah
spike
looks
at
dawn
good
lord
giles
writes
as
dull
as
he
talks
doesn't
he
spike
back
to
book
'they
started
work
but
the
council
has
suggested
to
us
that
they
were
interrupted
presumably
by
glory'
spike
dawn
continues
staring
into
the
distance
as
she
listens
'they
obviously
did
manage
to
accomplish
the
taste'
spike
looks
closer
'accomplish
the
task
they
had
to
be
certain
the
slayer
would
protect
it
with
her
life
so
they
sent
the
key
to
her
in
human
form
in
the
form
of
a
sister'

behind

where

is
already
moving
around
looking
at
stuff
we
need
to
find
out
everything
we
can
about
the
key
what's
it
for
who
created
it
and
why
glory
has
a
big

this
isn't
about
her
it's
about
dawn
she
deserves
to
know
where
she
came
from
she
needs
to
know
or
it's
just
gonna
eat
away
at
her
giles
looking
at
his
notebook
and
papers
on
the

how
did
she
find
these
how
did
she
get

anya
turns

shelves
holding
an

ew
who's

willow
looks
thoughtful
shot
of
buffy
as
the
realization
hits
her
cut
to
buffy
bursting
into
spike's
crypt
spike
is
sitting
atop
one
of
the
coffins
painting
his
fingernails
morning
sunshine
if
you've
come
around
for
eggs
or
sausage
i'm
fresh
out
buffy
grabs
the
lid
of
the
coffin
and
pulls
it
out
from
under
spike
so
that
he
tumbles
backward
into
the
coffin
he
sits
up
hey
careful
these
are
wet
spike
holds
up
his
hand
buffy
slides
the
lid
back
onto
the
coffin
so
that
it
slams
into
spike's
chest
pinning
him
against
the
opposite
side
of
the
coffin
how
could
you
let
her
find
out
like
that
from
books
and
papers
you
hate
me
that
much
i
was
just
along
for
the
ride
not

mystical
glowy
key

nobody
keeps
me
in

grab
a
midnight
stroll
she'll
find
a
way
sooner

later
i
just
thought
she'd
be
safer
with
big
bad
looking
over
her
shoulder
buffy
glares
at
him
silently
for
a
moment
she
shouldn't
have
found
out
like
that
you
didn't
think
you
could
keep
the
truth
from
her
forever
did
you
spike
angrily
maybe
if
you
had
been
more
honest
with
her
in
the
first
place
you
wouldn't
be
trying
to
make
yourself
feel
better
with
a
round
of
kick
the
spike
buffy
turns
and
storms
out
slamming
the
door
spike
sighs
and
shakes
his
head
cut

yes
they've
arrived
jinx
we
see
jinx
standing
in
the
corner
he
walks
over
to
stand
beside
the
knight's
bed
unfortunate
but
not
completely
unexpected
how
many
their
numbers
are
few
for
the
moment
but
they
will
grow
jinx
ben
puts
down
the
tray
the
knights
of
byzantium
are
like
ants
first
you
see
one
then
two
then
the
picnic's
ruined
no
matter
how
many
we
kill
they'll
keep
coming
wave
after
wave
jinx
walks
over
to
ben
it's
time
to
set
old
animosities
aside
your
fate
is
directly
linked
to
her
magnificentlyscented
glorificus
she's
been
extremely
forgiving
of
your
considerable
foibles
up
until
now
but
if
you
persist
in
your
defiance
she'll
be
forced
to
ben
to
what
what
is
she
going
to
do
send
a
sixpack
of
minions
to
bore
me
to
death
glory
can't
lay
a
finger
on
me
you
know
it
i
know
it
she
knows
it
so
save
the
threats
or
i'll
finish
the
job
i
started
on
your
head
he
shoves
past
jinx
and
exits
cut
to
exterior
of
the
summers
house
night
cut
to
dawn
in
her
bedroom
looking
through
her
diaries
she
has
a
bunch
of
them
of
different
sizes
shapes
covers
etc
she
clutches
one
to
her
chin
and
looks
pensive
cut
to
buffy
and
joyce
in
the
living
room
they
sit
sidebyside
on
the
sofa
we
can't
just
let
her
sit
up
there
all
alone
she
needs
time
we
can't
force
her
to
be
all
right
with
this
that's
your
answer
just
leave
her
alone
and
hope
that
everything
works
itself
out
no
but
if
i
were
her
i'd
want
a
little
bit
of
time
right
now
i
wouldn't
want
my
mother
and
my
sister
coming
at
me
from
all
sides
her
school
called
today
she
was
suspended
we
see
dawn
on
the
stairway
above
listening
joyce
os
she
yelled
at
a
teacher
the
things
she
said
buffy
i
mean
she
never
used
language
like
that
buffy
joyce
os
she
probably
feels
like
she
can
say
or
do
anything
right
now
she's
not
real
we're
not
her
family
we
don't
even
know
what
she
is
dawn
looks
shocked
cut
to
dawn
storming
back
into
her
room
crying
she
slams
the
door
looks
around
and
begins
to
trash
her
room
shrieking
she
shoves
stuff
off
the
desk
shoves
books
off
the
shelves
tears
posters
off
the
walls
she
picks
up
one
of
her
diaries
and
flips
through
it
then
begins
to
tear
out
pages
throws
them
in
the
wastebasket
then
throws
the
whole
book
in
extended
sequence
of
dawn
ripping
pages
out
of
diaries
throwing
the
pages
and
the
diaries
into
the
wastebasket
cut
back
to
living

joyce
jumps
up
staring
at
buffy
in
horror
how
can
you
talk
about
dawn
as
if
she's
a
thing
i'm
not
i'm
just
saying
that's
probably
how
she
feels
well
then
we
have
to
show
her
that
it
isn't
true
she
needs
to
know
that
she's
still
a
part
of
this
family
and
that
we
love
her
it's
not
that
simple
we're
not
gonna
be
able
to
fix
this
with
a
hug
and
a
kiss
and
a
bowl
of
soup
dawn
needs
to
know
where
she
came
from
she
needs
real
answers
joyce
sits
what
she
needs
is
her
sister
buffy
not
the
slayer
the
slayer
is
the
only
thing
standing
between
dawn
and
this
god
from
the
bitch
dimension
that
wants
to
shove
her
in
some
kind
of
lock
and
give
her
a
good
twirl
mom
i
need
to
be
out
there
doing

moves
forward
to
stand
beside
buffy
buffy
softly
just
find
her
please
cut
to
dawn
walking
through
a
playground
night
she
looks
over
at
a
swingset
flash
to
a
bright
sunny
day
small
girl
with
dawn's
hair
on
the
swing
bigger
girl
with
buffy's
hair
pushing
her
we
only
see
them
from
the
back
bet
you
can't
push
me
all
the
way
around
oh
yes
i
can
no
you
can't
flash
back
to
today
the
swingset
dark
and
empty
dawn
looks
sad
tears
on
her
face
she
turns
and
walks
away
cut
to
xander
and
giles
walking
through
alleys
in
sunnydale
night
giles
pokes
around
looking
behind
things
inside
dumpsters
etc
there's
so
many
things
i
remember
seeing
dawn
hanging
with
her
listening
to
buffy
complain
about
her
mostly
that
last
one
how
could
it
be
that
all
those
things
never
really
happened
well
it
takes
some
getting
used
to
the
idea
of
a
bright
fourteenyearold
actually
being
living
energy
thousands
of
years
old
they
continue
walking
looking
around
i'm
guessing
some
kind
of
superpowerful
in
her
raw
form
people
have
killed
died
for
it
summoned
armies
to
control
the
key
you
know
uh
she
kinda
has
a
crush
on
me
your
point
being
xander
stops
walking
well
nothing
no
uh
just
saying
powerful
being
big
energy
gal
digging
the
xanman
xander
grins
giles
frowns
at
him
some
guys
are
just
cooler
you
know
giles
turns
and
walks
away
rolling
his
eyes
xander
follows
cut
to
buffy
and
spike
walking
through
the
playground
night
buffy
calls
dawn
dawn
yeah
that
should
do
it
shut
up
the
nibblet
scampered
off
to
get
away
from
you
she
hears
you
bellowing
she's
gonna
pack
it
in
the
opposite
direction
spike
they
stop
walking
can't
say
i
blame
her
spike
looking
around
buffy
quietly
staring
at
the
ground
you
were
right
buffy
spike
looks
surprised
this
is
my
fault
i
should
have
told
her
spike
sighs
look
she
probably
would
have
skipped
off
anyway
even
if
she
never
found
out
she's
not
just
a
blob
of
energy
she's
also
a
fourteenyearold
hormone
bomb
spike
sighs
which
one's
screwing
her
up
more
right
now
spin
the
bloody
wheel
spike
shrugs
you'll
find
her
just
in
the
nick
of
time
that's
what
you
hero
types
do
buffy
gives
him
a
hopeful
look
spike
firmly
you'll
find
her
buffy
quietly
and
then
what
cut
to
dawn
walking
down
a
street
she
steps
aside
as
an
ambulance
goes
past
siren
wailing
lights
flashing
she
stares
after

goes
down
a

though
a

entering
the

repeats
his

also
getting
louder
and
louder
dawn
runs
to
the
door

he
grabs

by
the
arms
she
screams
she's
here
in
the
middle
of
'she's

ben
morphs
into
glory
dawn
gasps
and
stares
at
her
in
shock
glory
looks
confused
hey

blackout
act
iv

fade
back
in
on
the
hospital
dawn
is
sitting
in
the
chair
again
glory
os
ugh
cotton
we
see
glory
standing
by
the
lockers
taking
off
ben's
hospital
scrubs
her
back
to
the
camera
could
a
fabric
be
more
annoyingly
pedestrian
glory
reaches
into
a
locker
now
this
is
what
i'm
talkin'
about
glory
pulls
out
a
red
silk
blouse
and
slides
it
over
her
head
smiling
makes
your
skin
sing
you'reyou're
ben
glory
fastening
the
blouse
behind
her
uh
it's
an
eensy
more
complicated
than
that
family
always
is
isn't
it
dawn
looks
anxiously
toward
the
door
glory
still
with
her
back
to
dawn
you'd
never
make
it
i'd
rip
out
your
spine
before
you
got
half
a
step
and
those
little
legs
glory
smiles
over
her
shoulder
at
dawn
they
wouldn't
be
much
good
without
one
of
those
suddenly
glory
is
right
next
to
dawn
bending
over
with
her
hands
on
her
knees
so
that
her
face
is
at
dawn's
level
would
they
dawnie
dawn
looks
alarmed
now
what
i'm
trying
to
noodle
is
what
in
the
world
was
the
slayer's
little
sis
doing
here
with
gentle
ben
yyou
don't
remember
remember
what
glory
brushes
hair
off
dawn's
shoulders
you
were
talking
to
him

gasps
grabs
dawn's
chin
oh

wasn't
being
naughty

he
a
hospital
guard
enters
excuse
me
ma'am
this
area's
for
hospital
personnel
glory
turns
around
grabs
his
head
and
twists
it
breaking
his
neck
he
falls
to
the
floor
dawn
gasps
glory
turns
back
to
dawn
and
leans
down
again
rude
i
was
talking
glory
sighs
what
do
you
say

glory
pulls
dawn
to
her
feet
we
find
a
nice
place
off
the
beaten
glory
grabs
dawn
by
the
front
of
her
blouse
spins
her
around
where
you
and
i
can
have
a
long
uninterrupted
chat
glory
pushes
a
very
scared
dawn
around
in
front
of
her
cut
to
graveyard
night
buffy
and
spike
walk
up
and
encounter
willow
and
tara
we
looked
but

giles
and
xander
approach
what
about
the
carousel
checked
there
too
buffy
to
giles

could
have
happened
to
her
not

look
concerned
we
better
check
the
hospital
they
all
walk
off
together
cut
to
hospital
dawn
and
glory
are
in
some
sort
of
lab
with
xray
display
cases
along
one
wall
racks
full
of
beakers
and
test
tubes
glory
shoves
dawn
against
a
metal
counter
glory
briskly
okay
small
talk
over
i'm
in
a
bit
of
a
crunch
here
so
let's
cut
right
to
the
ooey
gooey
center
your
sister
the
slayer
has
my
key
it's
mine
i
want
it
glory
softer
do
you
know
where
she
squirreled
it
away
there's
ice
cream
and
puppydogs
in
it
for
you
if
you
start
singin'
dawn
nervously
i'm
not
sure
what
does
it
look
like
glory
smiles
fondly
puts
hands
over
her
heart
well
glory
walks
a
few
steps
away
gets
nostalgic
the
last
time
i
caught
a
peep
it
was
a
bright
green
swirly
shimmer
really
brought
out
the
blue
in
my
eyes
glory
annoyed
but
then
those
sneaky
little
monks
pulled
an
abracadabra
so
now
it
could
look
like
anything
you
see
the
predicament
i'm
in
maybe
yes
well
maybe
if
you
told
me
more
about
it
i'd
know
if
i've
seen
it
glory
sighs
leans
forward
puts
her
hands
on
the
table
on
either
side
of
dawn
dawn
gasps
nervously
glory
gazes
at
her
for
a
moment
okay
cut
to
the
others
waiting
in
the
hospital
emergency
room
buffy
turns
away
from
the
desk
she
wasn't
brought
in
which
is
a
happy
thing
right
i
don't
know
i
a
doctor
goes
by
leading
a
bunch
of
security
guards
found
him
on
the
floor
in
the
break

a
long
time

this
side
of

pause
very
quietly
is
it
evil
totally
dawn
gives
a
little
gasp
of
dismay
glory
laughs
well

i
guess
it
depends
on
your
point
of
view
what's
it

i
mean

gotta
be
a
lock

buffy's
foot
away

goes
into
a
backflip
and
kicks

in
the
face
on
the
way
down
giles
now
buffy
dives
out
of
the
way
and

fires
the
crossbow
the
arrow
bounces
off
glory's
stomach

looks
annoyed

her
over

iron
and

watch
the
hair

flings

flies
back
into

crash
into
the

hiding
place

streaking
toward

crouches
by
willow
as
