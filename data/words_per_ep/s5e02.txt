there
is
nothing
but
you
headshot
of
buffy
with
her
eyes
closed
quiet
meditative
music
begins
you
are
the
center
and
within
you
there
is
the
core
of
your
being
of
what
you
are
shot
of
giles
walking
in
a
circle
around
buffy
find
it
breathe
into
it
we
see
buffy
wearing
a
tanktop
and
pants
leaning
over
a
short
pedestal
with
both
her
hands
on
it
giles
walks
in
front
of
her
focus
inward
let
the
world
fall
away
fall
away
fall
away
the
camera
zooms
in
on
buffy's
face
as
giles
repeats
fall
away
she
opens
her
eyes
buffy
leans
forward
and
goes
into
a
handstand
balancing
on
her
hands
on
the
pedestal
the
pedestal
is
about
two
feet
high
and
four
inches
square
we
see
exercise
mats
underneath
it
and
a
vault
in
the
background
giles
is
still
walking
circles
around
buffy
staring
at
her
shot
of
a
large
flat
crystal
with
three
smaller
crystals
standing
on
end
atop
it
shot
of
giles
watching
buffy
closeup
of
buffy's
face
eyes
closed
again
she
begins
to
remove
one
hand
from
the
pedestal
slowmotion
shot
of
buffy
bringing
one
arm
out
parallel
to
the
floor
so
she
is
balancing
on
the
other
hand
giles
still
walking
around
her
watching
the
music
continues
buffy's
face
looks
very
peaceful
shot
of
the
crystals
a
hand
appears
and
tries
to
balance
a
fourth
crystal
on
top
of
the
three
standing
ones
but
it's
clumsy
and
all
the
crystals
fall
over
with
a
clunk
buffy's
eyes
pop
open
she
loses
her
concentration
and
crashes
to
the
floor
with
a
cry
giles
starts
toward
her
in
alarm
sees
she's
all
right
he
then
looks
in
a
different
direction
pulling
off
his
glasses
in
an
angry
motion
shot
of
the
ceiling
from
buffy's
point
of
view
dawn's
face
emerges
into
the
shot

fade
in
on
a
hanging
mobile
of
fish
the
camera
pans
across
a
bedroom
nobody
knows
who
i
am
not
the
real
me
it's
like
nobody
cares
enough
to
find
out
i
mean
does
anyone
ever
ask
me
what
i
want
to
do
with
my
life
or
what
my
opinion
is
on
stuff
or
what
restaurant
to
order
in
from
we
see
dawn
sitting
on
a
bed
wearing
pajamas
writing
in
a
diary
there's
a
huge
pile
of
stuffed
animals
on
the
bed
with
her
no
underline
exclamation
point
we
see
her
underlining
the
word
and
drawing
the
exclamation
point
she
ponders
for
a
moment
and
then
violently
draws
a
few
more
stabbing
at
the
paper
with

no

an
older
sister
who's
a
slayer
shot
of
buffy
opening
the
refrigerator
and
taking
out
a
carton
of
milk
people
wouldn't
be
so
crazy
about
her
if
they
had
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
her
every
single
day
everybody
cares
what
she
thinks
just
'cause
she
can
do
backflips
and
stuff
buffy
sniffs
the
milk
and
puts
it
on
the
counter
in
the
background
we
see
joyce
drinking
coffee
and
dawn
opening
a
cabinet
to
get
out
a
box
of
cereal
buffy
picks
up
a
banana
from
a
bowl
of
fruit
turns
away
like
that's
such
a
crucial
job
skill
in
the
real
world
as
buffy
moves
to
the
background
of
the
shot
to
get
a
bowl
joyce
and
dawn
move
to
the
foreground
joyce
pours
milk
into
her
coffee
cup
dawn
opens
the
cereal
box
and
sits
down
plus
mom
lets
her
get
away
with
everything
your
sister's
saving
the
world
joyce
moves
to
the
background
again
as
buffy
returns
with
a
bowl
which
she
places
on
the
counter
moving
the
milk
carton
aside
she
picks
up
the
banana
again
and
turns
away
peeling
it
dawn
takes
buffy's
bowl
and
pours
cereal
into
it
i
could
so
save
the
world
if
somebody
handed
me
super
powers
dawn
turns
away
from
the
table
as
buffy
returns
with
a
knife
prepared
to
slice
the
banana
into
her
bowl
but
finds
the
bowl
missing
she
sees
it
sitting
at
dawn's
spot
full
of
cereal
and
makes
an
irritated
face
but
i'd
think
of
a
cool
name
and
wear
a
mask
to
protect
my
loved
ones
which
buffy
doesn't
even
dawn
returns
with
a
spoon
wearing
an
innocent
expression
buffy
turns
away
to
get
another
bowl
and
dawn
picks
up
the
carton
of
milk
she
empties
it
into
her
bowl
and
sits
down
to
eat
if
this
town
wasn't
so
lame
everyone
would
completely
know
what
she
does
and
then
i
bet
they
wouldn't
even
be
that
impressed
because
like
killing
things
with
wood
oh
scary
vampires
they
die
from
a
splinter
buffy
returns
with
another
bowl
reaches
across
dawn
for
the
cereal
box
pours
it
into
her
bowl
picks
up
the
milk
carton
and
finds
it
empty
dawn
continues
eating
pretending
not
to
notice
so
buffy
what
are
your
plans

buffy
continues
giving
dawn
a
dirty
look
for
a
moment
then
looks

red
convertible

street

is
at
the
wheel
buffy
beside
him
and
dawn
in
the
back
classical
music
plays
on
the
radio
well
i
sympathize
with
you
buffy
i
truly
do
but
i'm
certain
that
riley
understands
better
than
anyone
else
the
importance
of
training
you
can't
allow
personal
concerns
to
distract
you
from
giles
dawn
reaches
between
them
to
change
the
radio
station
dawn
will
you
stop
fiddling
with
the
radio
and
sit
down
dawn
sits
back
looking
exasperated
the
radio
plays
classical
music
i
don't
think
buffy's
watcher
likes
me
too
much
shot
of
dawn
back
in
her
room
writing
in
her
diary
i
think
it's
'cause
he's
just
so
old
i'm
not
sure
how
old
he
is
but
i
heard
him
use
the
word
newfangled
one
time
so
he's
gotta
be
pretty
far
gone
cut
back
to
dawn
fidgeting
in
the
backseat
of
the
car
buffy
studying
a
piece
of
paper
there's
a
lot
of
books
on
this
list
any
of
them
come
on
tape
you
know
read
by
george
clooney
or
someone
cute
like
that
you're
entering
a
new
realm

myself

twodoor
tramp
giles
gives
her
a
sour
look
iii
don't
know
i
just
i
was
so
at
loose
ends
ii
found
myself
searching
for
some
way
of
feeling
more
shallow
perhaps
as
i
am
to
act
as
your
watcher
again
a
modicum
of
respect
might
be
in
order
do
i
have
to
i'm
serious
buffy
there's
going
to
be
far
less
time
for
the
sort
of
flighty
frivolous
dawn
giles
pointing
hey
there's
willow
and
tara
ooh
they
haven't
seen
my
new
car
he
pulls
over
buffy
rolls
her
eyes
at
him

willow
and
tara
coming
out
of
the
coffee
shop
hey

rest
of
the

dawn
smiling
willow

shrugs
in
embarrassment
willow's
the
awesomest
person
cut
back
to
dawn
in
pajamas
now
lying
on
her
bed
writing
in
the
diary
with
a
smile
she's
the
only
one
i
know
who
likes
school
as
much
as
me
cut
back
to
the
street
dawn
smiles
at
willow
then
the
camera
pans
over
to
tara
even
her
friends
are
cool
tara
smiles
and
gives
a
little
wave
hey
dawn
like
tara
dawn
voiceover
cut
back
to
dawn
in
the
bedroom
she
and
willow
are
both
witches
they
do
spells
and
stuff
which
is
so
much
cooler
than
slaying
i
told
mom
one
time
i
wished
they'd
teach
me
some
of
the
things
they
do
together
aand
then
she
got
really
quiet
and
made
me
go
upstairs
dawn
voiceover
she
pauses
in
her
writing
and
looks
puzzled
huh
i
guess
her
generation
isn't
cool
with
witchcraft
cut
back
to
the
street
dawn
and
tara
are
walking
sidebyside
with
giles
ahead
of
them
and
buffy
and
willow
in
the
lead
so
giles
and
i
worked
out
a
whole
schedule
around
school
a
block
of
time
every
day
just
to
focus
on
my
new
slayer
training
that's
a
work
ethic
buffy
you're
developing
a
work
ethic
oh
no
do
they
make
an
ointment
for
that
people
gotta
respect
a
solid
work
ethic
look
at
you
motivated
buffy
eager
to
soak
up
learning
oh
you
and
i
are
gonna
have
so
much
fun
this
semester
buffy
stops
walking
and
so
do
the
rest
of
them
yeah
that
reminds
me
with
the
whole
new
training
schedule
i
kinda
had
to
drop
a
class
that's
understandable
your
slayer
studies
are
way
more
important
so
i
won't
be
taking
drama
with
you
in
the
background
we
see
tara
and

peering
in
the
windows
of
the

out
a
little
farther
looking
around
dawn
she
looks
down
and
sees
dawn
sitting
on
the
ground
leaning
against
a
building
dawn
you
okay
is
is
that
guy
dead
in
there
tara
nods
yeah
she
sits
down
next
to
dawn
they're
gonna
be
a
little
while
longer
doing
the
detective
thing
best
nonscoobies
like
you
and
me
stay
out
of
the
way
dawn
nods
they
sit
silently
for
a
few
moments
do
you
wanna
thumbwrestle
dawn
nods
again
okay
they
lock
their
hands
together
and
begin
to
thumbwrestle
cut
to
a
shot
of
the
dead
guy
lying
faceup
giles'
hands
reach
over
and
close
his
eyes
judging
by
the
bitefest
i'd
say
it
was
more
than
one
vampire
giles
standing
up
i
make
it
four
at
least
looks
like
someone's
put
together
a
new
fang
club
buffy
walks
to
the
counter
willow
is
behind
it
holding
a
book
well
i've
crosschecked
the
inventory
list
and
things
are
definitely
missing
willow
puts
inventory
book
on
the
counter
mostly
books
including
a
treatise
on
the
mythology
and
methodology
of
the
vampire
slayer
buffy
pulls
out
her
list
as
giles
picks
up
the
inventory
book
oh
shoot
was
that
the
only
copy
come
on
buffy
this
could
be
very
serious
whoever's
leading
this
pack
of
vampires
appears
to
be
interested
in
learning
more
about
you
perhaps
searching
for
weaknesses
or
good
lord
what
well
i
had
no
idea
the
profit
margins
on
a
shop
like
this
were
so
high
buffy
and
willow
exchange
a
look
look
at
this
uh
low
overhead
outofstate
orders
international
it's
no
wonder
there's
never
any
trouble
attracting
new
owners
giles
looking
around
a
place
like
this
is
a
virtual
buffy
deathtrap
what
well
uh
yes
there
is
that
but
uh
still
giles
puts
book
down
and
looks
around
some
more
location
pedestrian
traffic
so
what's
the
next
step
giles
still
gazing
around
buffy
you
should
begin
looking
for
their
lair
straight
away
i'll
get
riley
to
help
me
patrol
wait
aren't
you
forgetting
something
impressive
square
footage
he
walks
off
as
buffy
gives
willow
a
questioning
look
you're
on
dawn
duty
buffy
looks
annoyed
oh
duty
i
gotta
drop
my
sister
back
home
buffy
eyes
widening
my
mother's
gonna
kill
me
giles
wandering
back
into
view
i
bet
the
death
rate
keeps
the
rent
down
giles
pauses
oh
hello
something's
been
taken
from
this
case
look
here
he
goes
over
to
a
case
where
the
glass
has
been
knocked
out
what'd
they
take
willow
looks
in
the
inventory
book
i
should
think
an
item
of
of
value
oror
power
possibly
even
a
willow
a
unicorn
10inch
ceramic
unicorn
imported
from
thailand
was
it
valuable
giles
stares
in
puzzlement
at
the
empty
case
willow
os
list
price
1295
which
begs
the
question
what
kind
of
an
unholy
creature
fancies
cheap
tasteless
statuary

to
head

sound
of

footsteps
joyce

look
up
as
dawn
appears
in
the
doorway
okay
doorbell
rings
cut
to
dawn
running
up
to
the
front
door
pausing
to
fix
her
hair
she's

watches
him
with
a
smile
as
joyce
appears
putting
on
a
jacket
we
see
her
and
xander
talking
but
we
only
hear
dawn's
voiceover
xander
is
so
much
cuter
than
anyone
and
smarter
too
he
totally
skipped
college
and
got
a
job
working
construction
which
is
so
kind
of
deep
you
know
he
builds
things
and
he's
brave
too
cut
to
dawn
in
her
pajamas
lying
on
the
bed
and
writing
in
her
diary
just
last
week
he
went

xander
her
card
have
fun
not
too
much
fun
though
xander
although
we
can
hear
this
line
and
it
sounds
like
xander's
voice
we
see
his
face
and
it's
clear
that
his
lips
aren't
moving
dawn
be
good
joyce
kisses
dawn
goodbye
oh
we
will
we're
just
gonna
play
with
matches
run
with
scissors
take
candy
from
some
guy
i
don't
know
his
name
xander
winks
at
dawn
joyce
leaves
and
dawn
smiling
at
xander
starts
to
shut
the
door
xander
treats
everyone
like
an
equal
he
doesn't
look
down
on
people
anya
appears
in
the
doorway
preventing
dawn
from
closing
the
door
anya
carries
a
stack
of
boardgame
boxes
hello
there
little
girl
dawn's
happy
expression
turns
to
one
of
dismay
even
when
he
should
anya
talking
as
if
to
a
very
small
child
we
are
gonna
have
fun
fun
fun
look
i've
got
monopoly
clue
and
ooh
the
game
of
life
that
sounds
good
dawn
looks
upset
she
closes
the
door
tara
os
poor
dawn
cut
to
tara
looking
at
herself
in
a
mirror
which
is
above
a
sink
with
a
towel
rack
beside
it
she
was
pretty
shaken
up
well
sure
bloody
death
and
stuff
the
camera
pans
out
and
we
see
they
are
in
a
dorm
room
unpacking
willow
goes
to
hang
a
painting
while
tara
is
unpacking
bathroom
stuff
from
a
box
she'll
be
okay
it's
just
i
i
think
it's
tough
for
her
not
being
able
to
well
allowed
to
you
know
help
willow
tries
the
painting
in
a
few
places
then
puts
it
atop
a
bureau
and
begins
unpacking
another
box
help
oh
you
you
guys
the
slayer
circle
well
buffy
doesn't
really
need
aand
i
think
dawn's
a
little
young
ii
know
you're
right
it's
just
hard
that
outsider
feeling
willow
looks
over
at
her
tara
you're
not
an
outsider
well
yeah
i
kinda
am
willow
walking
toward
her
no
you're
not
willow
it's
okay
where
does
this
go
somebody
making
you
feel
uncomfortable
is
it
xander
it's
xander
isn't
it
no
xander's
a
sweetie
it's
giles
it's
'cause
he's
british
and
doesn't
understand
about
stuff
it's
no
one
tara
continues
taking
stuff
out
of
the
box
you
guys
all
just
have
this
really
tight
bond
it'sit's
hard
to
break
into
that
and
i'm
not
even
sure
i
want
to
willow
walks
up
behind
tara
and
puts
her
arms
around
tara's
waist
resting
her
chin
on
tara's
shoulder
i'm
sure
tara
puts
her
hands
over
willow's
you're
completely
one
of
the
gang
now
everyone
accepts
that
closeup
of
their
faces
as
they
both
smile
you're
one
of
the
good
guys
tara's
smile
disappears
and
she
pulls
away
disengaging
herself
from
willow's
embrace
willow
doesn't
notice
her
expression
maybe
i
can
talk
to
the
rest
of
the
group
and
we
can
do
something
some
kind
of
scooby
initiation
willow
they
both
return
to
what
they
were
doing
oh
maybe
we
could
wear
some
kind
of
special
ring
that
identifies
us
as
members
i
don't
think
so
but
maybe
something
like
that
would
be
nice
for
dawn
i
do
worry
about
her
sometimes
you
don't
have
to
she's
got
big
sister
buffy
happily
looking
out
for
her
cut
to
buffy
and
riley
walking
through
a
graveyard
so
then
my
mom
goes
off
on
me
about
how
i'm
supposed
to
watch
out
for
dawn
and
make
sure
that
she's
shielded
from
something
that
might
upset
her
like
dead
shopkeepers
she
didn't
see
him
a
foot
maybe
a
dead
foot
which
is
bad
okay
but
hello
i
see
dead
stuff
all
the
time
and
you
don't
see
mom
shielding
me
so
you
want
your
mother
to
give
you
space
to
be
a
slayer
and
shield
you
from
it
at
the
same
time
thank
you
logic
boy
did
i
mention
this
is
a
rant
sense
really
has
no
place
in
it
i'm
getting
that
riley
sighs
what's
the
deal
buffy
you
seem
really
buffy
stops
him
by
putting
out
a
hand
she
stops
walking
and
looks
intently
to
her
right
oh
trash
can
from
a
distance
it
looked
kinda
riley
tense
nooo
ii
was
gonna
say
brown
squat
shadowy
uhuh
back
to
what
i
was
saying
before
we
were
rudely
attacked
by
nothing
you
seem
really
tense
buffy
shrugs
yeah
there's
a
new
vampire
gang
in
town
i
mean
domestically
tense
you're
on
dawn's
case
a
lot
i
guess
it's
just
buffy
sighs
i
don't
know
it
i
know
it's
always
been
this
way
she's
the
baby
but
for
some
reason
lately
it's
just
really
getting
to
me
she's
always
around
well
yeah
you're
like
her
idol
buffy
her
idol
i
don't
think
so
unless
you
like
to
spill
things
on
your
idol's
new
leather
pants
and
riley
you
know
what
i
mean
you
have
super
powers
and
college
a
studly
yet
sensitive
boyfriend
and
a
pesky
lifeordeath
job
that
i
can't
quit
or
even
take
a
break
from
she
doesn't
get
the
sacrifices
she's
a
kid
and
that's
what
bugs
she
gets
to
be
a
kid
and
she
acts
like
it's
the
biggest
burden
in
the
world
sometimes
i
would
like
to
just
curl
up
in
mom's
lap
and
not
worry
about
the
fate
of
the
world
i'd
like
to
be
the
one
who's
protected
who's
waited
on
cut
to
joyce's
house
hand
and
foot
getting
her
own
way
always
the
favorite
we
see
that
they're
playing
the
game
of
life
around
a
low
table
in
the
living
room
surrounded
by
various
junk
food
dawn
is
eating
a
bowl
of
ice
cream
you
nut
your
mom
loves
you
both
equally
but
if
i'm
wrong
i
find
money
usually
helps
tip
the
scale
slip
joyce
a
10
or
a
20
once
in
a
while
then
we'll
see
who's
the
favorite
dawn
smiles
he
says
i'm
like
a
kid
sister
xander
looking
at
the
game
board
here
comes
the
judge
but
sometimes
when
he
looks
at
me
i
feel
like
he
sees
me
as
i
am
xander
gives
dawn
a
big
goofy
grin
as
a
woman
we
see
that
dawn
has
chocolate
ice
cream
smeared
all
over
her
face
oh
crap
anya
slaps
down
her
cards
look
at
this
now
i'm
burdened
with
a
husband
and
several
tiny
pink
children
more
cash
than
i
can
reasonably
manage
that
means
you're
winning
really
yes
cash
equals
good
ooh
anya
claps
her
hands
in
excitement
i'm
so
pleased
anya
scoops
up
the
plastic
markers
that
represent
children
can
i
trade
in
the
children
for
more
cash
dawn
gives
her
a
disgusted
look
suddenly
something
smashes
in
the
window
showering
them
with
broken
glass
they
all
duck
behind
the
table
dawn
shrieks
xander
gets
up
and
goes
to
see
what
it
was
anya
follows
xander
picks
up
a
rock
with
a
note
tied
around
it
he
unties
the
string
hands
the
rock
to
anya
and
reads
the
note
dawn
stays
on
the
floor
watching
slayer
come
out
and
die
we
see
the
note
written
in
large
letters
the
i
in
die
is
dotted
with
a
smileyface
harmony
os
i'm
waiting
for
you
buffy
xander
goes
over
to
the
hole
in
the
window
and
peeks
out
he
sees
harmony
surrounded
by
her
four
minions
who
carry
weapons
harmony
looks
annoyed
harmony
yells
i
know

to

standing
in
the
doorway
holding
the
front
door

unimpressed

has
to
be
i'm
calling
her
out

see
anya
and
dawn
a
few
feet
behind
xander
then
i
bet
she'll
be
real
sorry
she
missed
your
call
'fraid
you
and
your
buddies
are
gonna
have
to
come
back
and

buddies

my
minions

what

xander
looks
skeptical
then
he
starts
laughing

be
funny
just
look
out
it's
a
terrifying
harmony
gang

to
attack
him
but
she
can't
go
past
the
doorway
dawn

behind

xander
continues
laughing

time
in
every
woman's
life
when
she
realizes
she
needs
to
take
the
next
step
i've
taken
it
i've
found
the
real
me
and
i
like
her
spike
moves
closer

of
thing

know
how
this
archvillain
thing
works
out

a
hand
over

sighs
then
turns
back
to
the
minions
harmony
smiling
guys
new
plan
cut
to
buffy
laying
out
a
huge
array
of
stakes
and
crosses
on
her
bed
as
riley
watches
that's
a
lot
of
weapons
for
somebody
you
weren't
sweating
twenty
minutes
ago
well
that
was
before
dawn
gave
harmony
a
backstage
pass
to
kill
us
all
in
our
sleep
buff
i
left
word
with
willow
she'll
come
do
a
return
engagement
of
her
uninvitation
spell
she
probably
still
has
the
stuff
from
last
week
and
bang
boom
you're
back
in
the
fortress
of
solitude
all
better
no
not
all
better
i
mean
it's
not
like
dawn
hasn't
grown
up
in
this
house
knowing
all
the
rules
cut
to
the
hallway
where
we
see
dawn
listening
in
buffy
os
especially
the
biggie
numero
oneoh
do
not
invite
bloodsucking
dead
people
into
our
house
buffy
dawn
rolls
her
eyes
cut
back
to
the
bedroom
i
mean
please
i
would
never
have
harmony
over
even
when
she
was
alive
people
slip
buffy
your
mom
did
she
invited
in
the
mas
xander
catches
himself
dracula
in
for
coffee
buffy
and
riley
give
xander
an
odd
look
well
that
was
different
i
mean
she
he
would
she
was
lonely
and
and
and
she
didn't
know
he
was
a
vampire
the
vampire
meanwhile
dawn
knew
exactly
what
harmony
was
and
she
rolled
out
the
welcome
mat
for
her
cut
back
to
dawn
in
the
hallway
riley
os
she's
just
a
kid
riley
dawn
rolls
her
eyes
cut
back
to
the
bedroom
you
know
will
everybody
please
stop
saying
that
i
was
just
a
kid
when
i
met
my
first
vampire
but
somehow
i
still
managed
to
remember
the
rules
you
had
to
it
was
your
job
buffy
putting
on
a
jacket
no
no
it
was
common
sense
but
nobody
expects
even
that
much
from
dawn
do
they
no
she
has
to
be
protected
and
coddled
from
the
big
bad
world
well
you
know
what
we
are
doing
nothing
but
turning
her
into
a
little
idiot
who
is
going
to
get
us
all
killed
cut
back
to
the
hallway
dawn
makes
an
unhappy
face
cut
back
to
the
bedroom
xander
and
riley
look
displeased
but
they
don't
argue
any
more
cut
back
to
the
hallway
dawn
turns
and
walks
away
cut
back
to
the
bedroom
buffy
sighs
and
speaks
more
quietly
she
just
has
to
be
more
careful
now
i
can't
be
there
to
protect
her
24
hours
a
day
ii
just
can't
cut
to
dawn
running
through
the
downstairs
part
of
the
house
passing
by
anya
in
the
kitchen
hey
don't
dawn
runs
out
the
back
door
and
anya
follows
dawn
dawn
stops
a
few
feet
outside
the
door
and
puts
her
hands
to
her
face
as
if
trying
not
to
cry
anya
grabs
her
shoulder
startling
her
what
do
you
think
you're
doing
leave
me
alone
i
will
after
you
come
back
inside
the
house
anya
grabs
dawn
and
starts
shoving
her
back
toward
the
door
let
go
of
me
dawn
breaks
free
no
it's
not
safe
out
here
dawn
shrieks
as
mort
steps
from
behind
a
bush
wearing
his
vamp
face
you
got
that
right
he
hits
anya
sending
her
flying
back
inside
where
she
falls
on
the
kitchen
floor
unconscious
mort
grabs
dawn
and
passes
her
to
the
other
minions
who
herd
her
away
shrieking
mort
pauses
to
look
at
anya
lying
on
the
floor
then
follows
the
other
minions
blackout
act
iv

xander
riley
and
buffy
come
down
the
stairs
and
find
anya
on
the
kitchen
floor
anya
xander
and
riley
kneel
to
lift
anya
up
buffy
goes
to
look
out
the
door
anya
half
conscious
oh
vampires
took
this
head
wound
looks
bad
we
gotta
get
her
to
the
hospital
buffy
goes
to
the
phone
anya
murmuring
they
took
her
shh
shh
dawn
dawn
whawhat
about
dawn
she
ran
out
they
took
her
vampires
oh
god
oh
god
uh
take
care
of
anya
buffy
hands
the
phone
to
riley
and
runs
out
buffy
cut
to
the
underground
lair
the
minions
look
a
little
impatient
all
right
once
again
nice
work
minionators
i'm
really
really
proud
of
you
guys
harmony
mort
comes
in
ah
mort
i
trust
you
made
our
guest
comfortable
mort
confused
you
told
me
to
chain
her
to
a
wall
yeah
i
know
i'm
being
you
know
sarcastic
or
whatever
harmony
mort
looks
blank
anyway
harmony
turns
back
to
the
other
minions
i'm
feeling
really
good
about
this
new
plan
people
i
think
it's
a
winner
when
do
we
eat
the
girl
we
don't
not
yet
why
not
because
that's
not
the
plan
harmony
sighs
do
i
have
to
go
over
the
plan
again
we
use
the
sister
as
bait
we
send
buffy
a
note
peaches
more
notes
harmony
annoyed
we
send
buffy
a
note
telling
her
that
if
she
wants
to
see
her
sister
again
she
has
to
come
alone
to
a
place
we
choose
she
comes
we
jump
her
we
kill
her
harmony
peaches
nods
so
it
doesn't
really
matter
if
we're
actually
holding
the
slayer's
sister
just
as
long
as
she
thinks
we
are
she'll
walk
into
the
trap
i
guess
so
it
won't
make
any
difference
if
we
eat
the
girl
now
we're
not
eating
the
girl
why
not
cause
that's
not
the
plan
all
the
minions
look
dissatisfied
cut
to
a
tv
showing
mostly
static
spike
bangs
on
it
and
fiddles
with
the
knobs
and
antenna
for
a
while
with
no
results
bollocks
gonna
have
to
pinch
one
of
those
satellite
dishes
he
looks
up
as
the
door
bangs
open
and
buffy
strides
in
well
speaking
of
dishes
to
what
do
i
owe
this
unpleasant
spike
buffy
hits
him
in
the
face
ow
bloody
hell
buffy
grabbing
his
shirt
i
don't
have
time
for
banter
spike
where's
harmony's
lair
haven't
seen
her
in
months
how
should
i
know
spike
buffy
hits
him
in
the
face
again
ow
where
is
she
at
least
lay
off
the
nose
spike
buffy
pulls
back
her
fist
okay
okay
used
to
have
a
cave
in
the
north
woods
about
forty
meters
past
the
overpass
construction
site
buffy
punches
him
in
the
nose
again
then
lets
go
and
turns
to
leave
ow
i
was
telling
you
the
truth
buffy
leaving
i
know
spike
rubs
his
nose
and
glares
after
her
cut
to
the
lair
they
don't
respect
me
they
pretend
they
do
but
deep
down
they
think
i'm
nothing
we
see
that
she's
talking
to
dawn
who's
chained
to
a
wall
with
her
wrists
at
head
height
i
mean
i'm
the
one
who
put
this
group
together
me
but
they
treat
me
like
i
don't
even
matter
do
you
have
any
idea
what
that
feels
like
a
little
harmony
whining
they
have
no
idea
how
much
pressure
i'm
under
i
have
to
make
all
the
hard
decisions
and
it's
hard
dawn
gasps
harmony
turns
to
see
mort
leading
the
other
minions
in
all
wearing
vamp
faces
excuse
me
i
didn't
hear
anybody
knock
we've
been
talking
it
over
and
we
decided
we
don't
like
this
plan
peaches
scornfully
except
for
brad
he
abstained
harmony
angry
oh
really
you
have
a
plan
you
like
better
we're
gonna
feed
on
the
girl
and
kill
you
dawn
looks
scared
maybe
not
in
that
order
i
don't
think
i
like
your
attitude
mort
harmony
to
the
others
kill
him
for
me
the
other
minions
don't
move
mort
smirks
all
right
you're
all
on
my
list
harmony
looks
nervous
as
mort
advances
toward
her
ththis
isn't
fair
okay
so
things
haven't
been
perfect
i
just
need
a
little
more
time
to
grow
into
my
leadership
role
time's
up
he
grabs
her
by
the
throat
dawn
watches
fearfully
as
cyrus
walks
toward
her
dawn
nervous
touch
me
and
my
sister's
gonna
kill
you
cyrus
smirks
and
reaches
out
one
finger
he
pokes
her
in
the
shoulder
and
laughs
the
other
minions
laugh
too
suddenly
the
point
of
a
stake
shoots
through
cyrus
from
behind
he
stops
laughing
and
turns
to
dust
mort
lets
go
of
harmony
and
they
both
turn
as
do
the
other
minions
who
are
holding
weapons
can't
say

didn't
warn
him
harmony

the
plan

buffy
with

his
swing
and
stakes
him
as
he
turns
to
dust
buffy
grabs
the
axe
from
him
brad
attacks
and
buffy
chops
off
his
head
dawn
scrunches
her
eyes
together
tightly
trap
harmony
when
you
tried
to
be
head
cheerleader
you
were
bad
when
you
tried
to
chair
the
homecoming
committee
you
were
really
bad
but
when
you
try
to
be
bad
you
suck
during
this
speech
we
see
mort
moving
around
behind
buffy
dawn
opens
her
eyes
and
sees
him
buffy
watch
out
buffy
turns
and
swings
the
axe
but
mort
knocks
it
out
of
her
grasp
and
knocks
her
down
ooh

shot
mort
i
think
you
got
her
on
the
mort
glares
at
her
harmony
laughs
nervously
turns
and
runs
away
mort
swings
at
buffy
she
punches
him
grabs
a
large
stick
and
hits
him
with
it
he
punches
her
she
ducks
a
few
more
punches
and
lands
one
on
him
shot
of
dawn
struggling
against
her
chains
as
sounds
of
battle
continue
buffy
kicks
mort
a
few
times
he
hits
her
a
few
times
and
she
goes
down
he
picks
her
up
and
throws
her
she
gets
up
and
they
exchange
more
punches
and
kicks
mort
grabs
buffy
by
the
neck
and
lifts
her
off
the
ground
she
looks
around
and
notices
a
large
unicorn
statue
nearby
she
shoves
mort
away
lands
on
the
ground
grabs
the
unicorn
and
stabs
him
through
the
heart
with
it
he
turns
to
dust
buffy
scowls
at
the
unicorn
then
shrugs
and
puts
it
down
buffy
strides
toward
dawn
picking
up
the
axe
along
the
way
you
are
going
to
be
in
so
much
trouble
when
we
get
home
buffy
strikes
at
the
chains
with
the
axe
yeah
well
i'm
telling
mom
you
slayed
in
front
of
me
fine
i'll
just
tell
her
that
you
ran
out
of
the
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
buffy
another
strike
at
the
chains
that
you
got
anya
hurt
buffy
another
strike
invited
a
vampire
in
buffy
strike
got
kidnapped
cut
to
exterior
shot
of
joyce's
house
night
cut
to
interior
of
the
kitchen
buffy
and
dawn
enter
moving
quietly
looking
around
guiltily
just
as
buffy
closes
the
back
door
joyce
comes
in
the
front
door
sorry
it
ran
so
late
everything
uh
go
okay
buffy
and
dawn
look
at
each
other
yeah
yeah
you
know
i
got
the
vamps
and
we
watched
some
tv
joyce
smiles
well
i
know
at
least
one
of
us
who's
supposed
to
be
in
bed
by
now
dawn
obediently
kisses
joyce
and
exits
night
so
how
was
the
exhibit
joyce
opening
the
fridge
oh
it
was
fantastic
we
see
dawn
looking
back
at
them
as
she
walks
toward
the
stairs
buffy
probably
would've
gotten
in
way
more
trouble
than
me
anyway
cut
to
the
magic
shop
day
dawn
is
sitting
at
a
table
writing
in
her
diary
but
i
guess
it
was
pretty
okay
of
her
not
to
say
anything
to
mom
anya's
gonna
be
okay
and
xander
wasn't
mad
at
me
so
stuff
mostly
worked
out
the
camera
pans
over
dawn
to
the
counter
where
we
see
buffy
leaning
against
it
giles
are
you
sure
about
this
giles
stands
up
behind
the
counter
why
wouldn't
i
be
well
aside
from
the
fact
that
most
magic
shop
owners
in
sunnydale
have
the
life
expectancy
of
a
spinal
tap
drummer
and
have
you
ever
run
a
store
before
i
was
a
librarian
for
years
this
is
exactly
the
same
except
people
pay
for
the
things
they
don't
return
giles
comes
out
from
behind
counter
it'll
give
me
focus
increase
my
resources
and
it'll
prevent
you
lot
from
trampling
all
over
my
flat
at
all
hours
giles
he
and
buffy
walk
toward
the
back
there
may
even
be
some
space
for
you
to
train
in
the
back
boy
you've
really
thought
this
through
how
bored
were
you
last
year
i
watched
passions
with
spike
let
us
never
speak
of
it
giles
exits
buffy
follows
him
out
laughing
a
moment
later
she
reappears
in
the
doorway
don't
break
anything
dawn
gives
her
an
exasperated
look
buffy
goes
out
then
comes
back
in
again
just
don't
touch
anything
buffy
exits
not
that
buffy's
really
changed
at
all
like
she
ever
would
buffy
reappears
in
the
doorway
what
you're
doing
right
now
not
moving
buffy
makes
the
okay
sign
with
her
fingers
good
keep
doing
that
buffy
exits
she
still
thinks
i'm
little
miss
nobody
just
her
dumb
little
sister
boy

she
in
for
a
surprise
