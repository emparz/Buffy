the
door
to

willow
smiles
at
her
and
waves
buffy
raises
her
hand
back
but
remains
confused
about
the
monkey
i
cannot
describe
this
feeling
buffy
continues
on
and
finds
her
mother
holding
a
large
cup
and
saucer
now
that
i've
found
this
love

buffy
watches
her
go
then
looks
around
the
room
again
now
that
i've
found
this
love
she
walks
past
willow
again
and
through
the
crowd
to
the
stage
it's
empty
no

tonight
she
turns
around
and
smiles
warmly
i'm
a
fire
burning
like
a
house
aflame
angel
is
standing
at
the
pool
table
he
smiles
and
starts
toward
her
i'm
a
hurricane
buffy
begins
to
walk
toward
him
i
cannot
move
or
see
you
fly
now
that
i've
found
drusilla
suddenly
appears
behind
angel
she
is
vamped
out
and
thrusts
a
stake
into
his
back
and
pulls
it
out
he
arches
backward
in
pain
angel
this
love
they
reach
out
for
each
other
before
she
can
touch
him
his
hand
begins
to
disintegrate
the
rings
on
his
fingers
fall
to
the
floor
his
body
doesn't
explode
like
most
vampires'
but
just
crumbles
to
dust
drusilla
lowers
the
stake
and
takes
the
few
steps
over
to
buffy
happy
birthday

to

i

cut
to
cordelia's
locker
the
camera
is
inside
looking
out
cordelia
swings
the
door
open
xander
is
standing
behind
her
so
buffy's
party
manana
well
just
because
she's
miss
savetheworld
and
everything
you
have
to
make
a
big
deal
i
have
to
cook
and
everything
you're
cooking
well
i'm
chips
and
dips
girl
xander
gasps
horrors
all
that
opening
and
stirring
and
shopping
and
carrying
well
then
you
should
have
a
person
who
does
such
things
for
you
well
that's
what
i've
been
saying
to
my
father
but
does
he
listen
um
so
uh
you're
going
and
and
and
i'm
going
should
we
maybe
go
cut
outside
the
locker
why
i
dunno
this
thing
with
us
despite
our
better
judgment
it
keeps
happening
maybe
we
should
just
admit
that
we're
dating
groping
in
a
broom
closet
isn't
dating
you
don't
call
it
a
date
until
the
guy
spends
money
fine
i'll
spend
then
we'll
grope
whatever
i
just
think
it's
some
kind
of
whacked
that
we
feel
we
have
to
hide
it
from
all
our
friends
well
of
course
you
wanna
tell
everybody
you
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
i
on
the
other
hand
have
everything
to
be
ashamed
of
you
know
what
'nuff
said
forget
it
it
must've
been
my
multiplepersonality
guy
talking
i
call
him
idiot
jed
glutton
for
punishment
he
looks
at
her
and
exhales
then
turns
and
walks
off
cut
further
down
the
hall
giles
comes
walking
out
of
the
lounge
and
sees
xander
oh

absolutely
you

weasel
giles
looks
at
the
stairs
and
sees
jenny
and
buffy
coming
down
here
comes
buffy
giles
to
xander
now
remember
discretion
is
the
better
part
of
valor
you
coulda
just
said
'shh'
god
are
all
you
brits
such
drama
queens
xander
to
buffy
buffy
i
feel
a
prebirthday
spanking
coming
on
i'd
curb
that
impulse
if
i
were
you
xander
she
and
buffy
sit
at
a
table
in
the
lounge
xander
into
his
shirt
check
cancel
spanking
giles
sits
also
you
alright
buffy
you
seem
a
little
fatigued
rough
night
i
had
a
dream
that
drusilla
was
alive
and
she
killed
angel
iit
just
really
freaked
me
out
you
fear
it
was
more
of
a
a
a
portent
see

don't
know
i
don't
wanna
start
a
big
freakout
over
nothing
still
best
to
be
uh
on
the
alert
if
drusilla
is
alive
ii
it
could
be
a
fairly
cataclysmic
state
of
affairs
again
so
many
words
couldn't
you
just
say
'we'd
be
in
trouble'
giles
gives
xander
a
look
go
to
class
xander
gone
xander
gets
up
and
starts
away
but
stops
notice
the
economy
of
phrasing
'gone'

points
at
giles
and
leaves
maybe
i
should
get
'gone'
too
buffy
stands
up

and
kneels
in
front
of
spike

so
important
to
make
you
ignore
the
responsibility
to
your
people
well
i've
been
working
and
enyos
interrupts
the
elder

the
curse
still
holds
the
elder

can
feel
it
jenny
looks
down
there

girl
enyos
exhales
in
disgust
what
how
could
you
let
this
happen
i
promise
you
angel
still
suffers
and
he
makes
amends
for
his
evil
he
even
saved
my
life
so
you
just
forget
that
he
destroyed
the
most
beloved
daughter
of
your
tribe
that
he
killed
every
man
woman
and
child
that
touched
her
life
vengeance
demands
that
his
pain
be
eternal
as
ours
is
if
this
this
girl
gives
him
one
minute
of
happiness

is
one
minute

word
buffy
looks
up
at
him
it

sits
on
the
end
of
the
table
xander
and
willow
come
bounding
in
hey
it's
the
woman
of
the

jumps
over
to
the
table
hugs
buffy's
shoulders
and
gives
her
a
big
smile
she
lets
go
and
goes
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
with
xander
buffy
just
looks
down
and
pulls
her
hair
behind
her
ear
not
happy
birthday
buffy
iit's
just
that
um
part
of
the
nightmare
that
buffy
had
the
other
night
actually
transpired
which
means
drusilla
might
still
be
alive
giles
in
my
dream
i
couldn't
stop
her
she
blindsided
me
aangel
was
gone
before
i
knew
what
happened
even
if
she
is
alive
uh
we
can
still
protect
angel
dreams
aren't
prophecies
buffy
yyyyou
dreamt
that
the
master
had
risen
but
you
stopped
it
from
happening
you
ground
his
bones
to
make
your
bread
that's
true
except
for
the
bread
part
buffy
to
giles
okay
so
fine
we're
one
step
ahead
but
i
wanna
stay
that
way
absolutely
giles
stands
up
let
me
read
up
on
drusilla
uh
see
if
she
has
any
particular
patterns
giles
starts
toward
his
office
why
don't
you
meet
me
here
at
700
we'll
map
out
a
strategy
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
until
then
go
to
classes
do
your
homework
have
supper
right
be
that
buffy
she
gets
up
from
the
table
grabs
her
bag
and
heads
out
of
the
library
xander
pointing
well
that's
not
a
perky
birthday
puppy
so
much
for
our
surprise
party
i
bought
little
hats
and
everything
mmhm
oh
well
i
guess
i'll
tell
cordelia
willow
starts
to
go
no
you
won't
giles
willow
and
xander
stop
we're
having
a
party
tonight
xander
stares
at
giles
looks
like
mr
caution
man
but
the
sound
he
makes
is
funny
willow
frowns
and
nods
in
agreement
buffy's
surprise
party
will
go
ahead
as
we
planned
except
i
won't
be
wearing
the
little
hat
but
buffy
and
angel
may
well
be
in
danger
as
they
have
been
before
and
i
imagine
will
be
again
one
thing
i've
learned
in
my
tenure
here
on
the
hellmouth
is
that
there
is
no
good
time
to
relax
and
buffy's
turning
17
just
this
once
and
she
deserves
a
party
you're
a
great
man
of
our
time
willow
smiles
and
anyway
angel's
coming
so
she'll
be
able
to
protect
him
and
have
cake
precisely
he
goes
into
his
office
willow
and
xander
leave
with
a
happy
bounce
in
their
step
cut
to
the
school
that
night
cut
to
a
hall
buffy
comes
walking
down
jenny
sees
her
buffy
buffy
startled
oh
my
god
i
didn't
see
you
there
sorry

me
to
tell
you
that
there's
been
a
change
of
plans
uh
he
wants
to
meet
you
someplace
near
his
house
'cause
he
had
to
run
home
and
get
a
book
or
something
'cause
heaven
knows
there
aren't
enough
books
in
the
library
uh
he's
very
thorough
oh
which
is
not
to
bag
it's
kind
of
manly
in
an
obsessivecompulsive
kind
of
way
don't
you
think
mmhm
um
you
know
my
car's
here
why

i
drive

okay
she
starts
out
to
the
parking
lot
jenny
watches
her
go
a
few
steps
and
then
follows
cut
to
the
alley
outside
the
bronze
jenny's
beetle
rolls
slowly
along

we
goin'
to
the
bronze
i'm
not

me
an
address

just
following
his
directions
they
round
a
corner
and
buffy
sees
something
going
on
this
looks
funky
stop
for
a
sec
a
truck
is
parked
in
an
adjacent
loading
area
a
man

off

bed
while
another
walks
across
the
loading
dock
no

she
gets
out
of
the
car
and
goes
to
investigate
jenny
sighs
what
is
this
jenny
leans
her
head
on
her
hand
cut
to
the
truck
buffy
walks
up
and
stops
by
the
cab
she
sees
dalton
carrying
a
wooden
box
every
time
i
see
you
you're
stealing
something
dalton
growls
you
really
should
speak
with
someone
about
this
klepto
issue
the
truck's
engine
starts
buffy
turns
and
reaches
for
the
door
handle
dalton
makes
a
hasty
escape
the
truck
door
swings
open
before
buffy
can
reach
it
and
a
vampire
kicks
out
at
her
hitting
her
in
the
arm
but
not
hard
she
grabs
for
him
and
pulls
him
out
of
the
cab
and
onto
the
ground
dalton
lifts
the
box
onto
the
back
of
the
truck
the
vampire
gets
up
from
the
pavement
and
buffy
punches
him
knocking
him
back
down
again
she
backs
up
toward
the
truck
to
get
around
him
but
a
third
vampire
standing
in
the
bed
grabs
her
by
the
jacket
and
lifts
her
up
he
gets
her
in
a
full
nelson
hold
she
pushes
him
back
into
a
large
box
he
is
stunned
and
lets
go
of
his
hold
she
snaps
her
head
back
and
butts
him
hard
the
other
vampire
has
climbed
onto
the
truck
bed
also
and
comes
at
her
she
punches
him
turns
and
punches
the
one
behind
her
turns
and
punches
the
other
one
again
then
kicks
him
in
the
chest
making
him
fall
and
roll
over
a
crate
she
blocks
a
swing
from

his
arm
and
shoves
his
head

out
from

a
pillar
and
looks
around
where

out
from

outside
buffy
punches
one
of
the
wooden
bed
retainers
and
breaks
off
a
piece
she
jams
it
into
one
of
the
vampires'
chests
and
he
bursts
into
ashes
the
other
grabs
her
from
behind
lifts
her
up
and
carries
her
onto
the
loading
dock
he
throws
her
at
a
door
she
hits
it
and
rolls
away

inside
the
gang

the
fighting
going
on
outside

looks
toward

come
crashing
through
and
hit
the
floor

kicks
the
vampire
as
he
comes
for

stumbles
back

few
steps
the
others
come
closer
to

grabs
a
drumstick
from

everything'
giles

able
to
dismember
him
but
uh
not
kill
him
the
pieces
were
scattered
buried
in
every
corner
of
the
earth
so

drusilla

she
lifts

floor
she
stomps
on

into
the
concrete
she
lifts

eyes
closed
make
a
wish
what
she
holds
two
fingers

wanker
but
he's
the
only
one
we've

can
eat
his
eyes
out
of
the
sockets

swear
drusilla
thrusts
both
hands
at
him
and
pulls
them
back
at
the
last
instant
and
up
into
raised
fists
and
smiles
at
him

she
bends
down
and
picks
up
his
glasses
okay

unfolds
them
and
sets
them

on
his
nose

drusilla
pats
his
head
she
steps
over
to

a
sigh
of
relief

cut
to
the
library
giles
is
researching
the
judge
he
looks
up
from
his
books
they
should
be
back
by
now
maybe
buffy
needed
a
few
minutes
to
pull
herself
together
poor
buffy
on
her
birthday
and
everything
hmm
it's
sad
granted
but
let's
look
at
the
upside
for
a
moment
xander
gets
up
i
mean
what
kind
of
a
future
would
she've
really
had
with
him
willow
looks
sadly
up
at
him
she's
got
2
jobs
denny's
waitress
by
day
giles
looks
up
too
slayer
by
night
and
angel's
always
in
front
of
the
tv
with
a
big
blood
belly
and
he's
dreamin'
of
the
glory
days
when
buffy
still
thought
this
whole
creature
of
the
night
routine
was
a
big
turn
on
you've
thought
way
too
much
about
this
no
no
that's
just
the
beginning
have
i
told
you
the
part
where
i
fly
into
town
in
my
private
jet
and
take
buffy
out
for
prime
rib
willow
sees
buffy
come
in
xander
and
she
cries
giles
stands
up
what
happened
giles
xander
sits
dru's
guys
ambushed
us
they
got
the
box
where's
jenny
uh
she
took
angel
to
get
clothing
i
i
had
some
here
and
we
needed
clothes
because
we
got
wet
giles
what
do
we
know
the
more
i
study
the
judge
the
less
i
like
him
his
touch
can
literally
burn
the
humanity
out
of
you
a
true
creature
of
evil
can
survive
the
process
no
human
ever
has
what's
the
problem
we
send
cordy
to
fight
this
guy
and
we
go
for
pizza
xander
smiles
can
this
guy
be
stopped
without
an
army
um
giles
reads
'no
weapon
forged
can
kill
him'
not
very
encouraging
if
we
could
only
stop
them
from
assembling
him
we
need
to
find
his
weak
spots
and
we
need
to
figure
out
where
they'd
be
keeping
him
this
could
take
time
better
do
a
roundrobin
xander
you
go
first
good
call
xander
heads
for
the
phone
round
robin
it's
when
everybody
calls
everybody
else's
mom
and
tells
them
they're
staying
at
everyone's
house
thus
freeing
us
up
for
world
saveage
willow
smiles
and
allnight
keggers

gets
looks
from
buffy
and
