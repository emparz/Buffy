this
job

actual
slaying
xander
goes
in
you

in
the
act
by
a
zookeeper
oh
hold

that
hyenas
are
capable
of
understanding
human
speech
they
follow
humans
around
by
day
learning
their
names
at
night
when
the
campfire
dies
they
call
out
to
a
person
once
they
separate
him
the
pack
zookeeper
snaps
his
fingers
devours
them
cut
inside
the
hyena
house
kyle
and
the
others
tear
through
more
tape
blocking
the
way

green
and
then
two
of
the
kid's
eyes
do
the
hyena's
eyes
flash
green
again
and
two
more
kid's
eyes
do
cut
to
a
shot
from
above
of
the
sacred
circle
painted
on

makes
an
anxious

trips
on

chair
and
falls

notebook
skids
across
the
floor
to
the
far

from
the
bar
buffy
has
a
drink
and
a
croissant
they
make
their
way
over
to
an
empty
table
i
thought
xander
would
be
here
by
now
hmm
that'd
make
him
on
time
we
couldn't
have
that
did
he
seem
upset
at
all
on
the
bus
back
from
the
zoo
about
what
i
dunno
he
was
quiet
i
didn't
notice
anything

not
as
hyperaware
of
him
as

not
constantly
monitoring
his
health

moods

mock
annoyance
goes
with
the

a
look
from
willow

relationship
willow

to
another
table
that's
occupied
selfish
man
who
never
gave
to
no
one

it
worth
the
price

pay
kyle
to
the
boy
at
the
table
y'know
i
don't
understand
why
you're
sitting
at
our
table
'cause

you
be
hovering
over
the
football
stadium
with
'goodyear'
written
on
you

i
hope

not
staring
blindly
at
me
they
all
laugh
xander
was
watching
and
laughs
also
as

fat
cut
to
the

a
high
punch
and
a
swinging
middle
punch
to
giles'
gloved

she
continues
doing
a
full

full
spinning
jumping
high
wheel
kick
followed
by

a
front
snap

then
she
jumps
high
and
does
a
twin
straddle
kick

on
her
feet
and
moves
in
to
attack
again
when
giles
suddenly
jumps
back

giles
buffy
stops
short
that's
enough
training
for
one
day
well
that
last
roundhouse

giles
buffy
goes
giles
to
himself
while

wait
for
the
feeling
to
return
to
my
arms
cut
to
the
halls
herbert
the
mascot
has
gotten
loose
the
students
in
the
hall
are
startled
and
try
to
get
away
mr
flutie
chases
the
pig
look
out
it's
gotten
loose
the
camera
dodges
the
students'
legs
from
herbert's
point
of
view
buffy
comes
around
the
corner
reacts
quickly
to
catch
him
and
picks
him
up
lordy
herbert
gave
mr
flutie
quite
a
scare
didn't
he
students
i'd
like
you
all
to
met
herbert
our
new
mascot
for
the
sunnydale
high
razorbacks
the

no
he's
a
fierce
razorback
mr
flutie
more
clapping
he
doesn't
look
mean
mr
flutie
he's
mean
he's
ready

mr
flutie
indicates
herbert's
helmet
with
foam
tusks
here

the
tusks
mr
flutie
gestures
at
a
piece
of
serrated
green
foam
tied
to
herbert's
back
the
scary
razorback
you're
right
he's
a
fine

fortune
to
feed
him
mr
flutie
to
herbert
alright
let's
get
you
back
into
your
cage
herbert
squeals
when
buffy
wants
to
hand
him
to
mr
flutie
mr
flutie
points
behind
himself
this
way
cut
outside
to
willow
helping
xander
with
his
geometry
i'm
not
getting
this
it's
simple
really
see
'the
bisector
of
a
vertex
is
the
line
that
divides
the
angle
at
that
vertex
into
two
equal
parts'
xander
it's
like
a
big
blur
all
these
numbers
and
angles
it's
the
same
stuff
from
last
week
you
had
it
down
then
why
do
i
need
to
learn
this
'cause
otherwise
you'll
flunk
math
explain
the
part
where
that's
bad
xander
rubs
the
bridge
of
his
nose
you
remember
you
fail
math
you
flunk
out
of
school
you
end
up
being
the
guy
at
the
pizza
place
that
sweeps
the
floor
and
says
'hey
kids
where's
the
cool
parties
this
weekend'
we've
been
through
this
willow
xander
rubs
his
right
temple
do
you
have
a
headache
willow
reaches
up
to
him
xander
shakes
her
off
yeah
and
i
think
i
know
what's
causing
it
xander
throws
his
geometry
book
into
the
trash
ah
that's
better
it
goes
right
to
the
source
of
the
pain
xander
look
forget
it
okay
i
don't
get
it
i
won't
ever
xander
gets
up
i
don't
care
he
throws
his
math
notebook
into
willow's
lap
and
leaves
in
a
huff
willow
watches
xander
go
we
can
finish
this
another
time
cut
to
the
halls
buffy
follows
mr
flutie
to
the
faculty
room
with
herbert
in
her
arms
they
stop
outside
see
the
problem

no
school
spirit
hold
on
let
me
get
his
outfit
off
mr
flutie
removes
it
today
it's
all
gangs
and
drugs
and
those
movies
on
showtime
with
the
nudity
mr
flutie
buffy
gives
him
a
look
i
don't
have
cable
i
only
heard
when
i
was
your
age
we
cared
about
the
school's
reputation
and
the
football
team's
record
all
that
stuff
of
course
when
i
was
your
age
i
was
surrounded
by
old
guys
telling
me
how
much
better
things
were
when
they
were
my
age
mr
flutie
goes
into
the
faculty
room
buffy
to
herbert
yeah
xander
comes
into
the
hall
from
outside
herbert
squeals
and
reacts
to
his
presence
as
he
walks
by
buffy
looks
confused
as
she
watches
xander
pass
and
tries
to
keep
herbert
from
jumping
out
of
her
arms
cut
outside
lightning
strikes
cut

the
pack

dodge
the
balls
the
coach
enjoys
the

from
the

xander
nails
another
victim
the
coach
continues
to
watch
buffy
throws
a
ball
and
hits
her
mark
xander
throws
again
and
nails
willow
hard
on
the
back
she
gives
him
a
hurt
and
confused
look
as
she
walks
off
of
the
court
xander
catches
a
ball
as
he
watches
willow
go
but
soon
continues
the
game
willow
sits
down
crosses
her
arms
and
keeps
looking
at
him
a
few
seconds
later
just
the
pack
and
lance
are
left
on
one
side
buffy
on
the
other
the
pack
looks
at
her
then
focuses
on
lance

falls
to
the
floor
and
cowers
as
they
each
throw
their
ball
at
him
hard
buffy
runs
over
and

kyle

so
much
detention
your
grandchildren'll
be
staying
after
school
cut
to
the
library
willow
is
at
the
table
researching
buffy
is
on
the
stairs
behind
her
with
a
book
wow
apparently
noah
rejected
the
hyenas
from
the
ark
because
he
thought
they
were
an
evil
impure
mixture
of
dogs
and
cats
hyenas
aren't
well
liked
they
do
seem
to
be
the
schmoes
of
the
animal
kingdom
buffy
comes
over
to
willow
why
couldn't
xander
be
possessed
by
a
puppy
or
or
some
ducks
that's
assuming
'possession'
is
the
right
word
giles
comes
over
from
the
cage
oh
i'll
say
it
is
the
masai
of
the
serengeti
have
spoken
of
animal
possession
for
for
generations
i
i
should
have
remembered
that
so
how
does
it
work
well
apparently
there's
a
a
sect
of
animal
worshipers
known
as
primals
they
believe
that
humanity
uh
consciousness
uh
the
soul
is
a
is
a
perversion
a
dilution
of
spirit
uh
to
them
the
animal
state
is
holy
they
are
able
through
transpossession
to
to
um
draw
the
spirit
of
certain
animals
into
themselves
and
then
they
started
acting
like
hyenas
well
only
the
most
predatory
of
animals
are
are
of
interest
to
the
primals
so
uh
yes
yes
that
would
fit
yes
so
what
happens
to
the
person
once
the
spirit's
in
them
if
it
goes
unchecked
he
hands
buffy
a
book
open
to
a
certain
page

takes
one
look
slams
the

shut
and
quickly
gets

heidi
stops

away
and
sees
the

and
begins
feeding
the
camera

in
on
a
picture
of
mr
flutie
on
his
desk
part
3

the
library
willow
is
watching
footage
of
feeding
hyenas
on
the
pc
she
looks
up
when
she
hears
the
door
open
and
stops
the
playback
she
sees
buffy
dragging
xander
into
the
library
and
goes
over
to
them
hurry
up
we
gotta
get
him
locked
up
somehow
before
he
comes
to
oh
my
god
xander
what
happened
i
hit
him
with
what
a
desk
willow
opens
the
cage
door
and
buffy
drags
him
in
he
tried
his
hand
at
felony
sexual
assault
oh
buffy
the
hyena
in
him
didn't
no
buffy
they
arrange
him
on
the
floor
of
the
cage
no
but
it's
safe
to
say
that
in
his
animal
state
his
idea
of
wooing
doesn't
involve
a
yanni
cd
and
a
bottle
of
chianti
buffy
locks
the
cage
there
that
oughta
hold
him
where's
giles
he
got
called
to
some
teacher's
meeting
what
are
we
gonna
do
i
mean
how
do
we
get
xander
back
giles
comes
into
the
library
right
now
i'm
a
little
more
worried
about
what
the
rest
of
the
pack
are
up
to
the
rest
of
the
pack
were
spotted
outside
herbert
the
mascot's
cage
they
were
sent
to
the
principal's
office
good
that'll
show
'em
willow
giles
is
silent
did
it
show
'em
giles
exhales
but
remains
silent
searching
for
what
to
say
they
didn't
hurt
him
did
they
they
uh
ate
him
willow
has
to
sit
down
she
and
buffy
can't
believe
what
they
just
heard
they
ate
principal
flutie
ate
him
up
the
uh
official
theory
is
that
wild
dogs
got
into
his
office
somehow
there
was
no
one
at
the
scene
but
xander
didn't
willow
to
buffy
he
he
was
with
you
giles
sees
xander
in
the
cage
oh
uh
well
that's
a
small
mercy
giles
how
do
we
stop
this
how
do
you
transpossess
someone
ii'm
afraid
i
still
don't
have
all
the
pieces
um
the
accounts
of
the
primals
and
their
methods
are
a
bit
thin
on
the
ground
there
is
some
talk
of
aaa
predatory
act
but
the
exact
ritual
is
is
um
giles
picks
up
a
book
the
malleus
maleficarum
deals
in
particulars
of
demonic
possession
which
may
apply
giles
looks
through
a
few
pages
yes
one
one
should
be
able
to
transfer
the
spirits
to
another
human
oh
that's
great
any
volunteers
oh
good
point
what
we
need
to
do
is
put
the
hyena
back
in
the
hyena
bbut
until
we
know
more
uh
betcha
that
zookeeper
could
tell
us
maybe
he
didn't
quarantine
those
hyenas
because
they
were
sick
we
should
talk
to
him
okay
buffy
starts
to
go
but
stops
oh
wait
somebody's
gotta
watch
xander
willow
gets
up
i
will
will
are
you
sure
if
he
wakes
up
willow
holds
her
hand
out
for
the
keys
i'll
be
alright
go
after
a
moment's
hesitation
buffy
gives
willow
the
keys
to
the
cage
and
grabs
her
coat
buffy
to
giles
c'mon
willow
watches
them
leave
then
looks
over
at
xander
in
the
cage
she
slips
the
keys
into
her
pocket
cut
outside
at
night
a
young
woman
with
her
baby
in
a
backpack
walks
through
some
bushes
and
sees
the
pack
lying
on
the
ground
sleeping
after
their
meal
the
pack
wakes

office
the
students
have
been
possessed
by
the
hyenas
yes
are
you
sure
we're
really
really
sure
yyou
don't
seem
enormously
surprised
by
this
the
zoo
imported
those
hyenas
from
africa
there
was
something
strange
about
them
from
day
one
i
did
some
homework
that
particular
breed
is
very
rare
totally
vicious
historically
they
were
worshipped
by
these
guys
primals
yeah
creepy
guys
now
they
had
rituals
for
taking
the
hyena
spirits
but
ii
don't
see
how
that
coulda
happened
to
your
kids
uh
we
don't
know
exactly
how
the
ritual
works
we
know
that
it
involves
a
um
um
predatory
act
and
some
kind
of
symbol
predatory
act
of
course
that
makes
sense
where
did
you
read
that
do
you
have
sherman
jeffries'
work
on
on
cults
and
on
boys
sorry
look
giles
raises
his
hand
slightly
sorry
look
i
think
we
may
have
enough
information
so
that
together
we
could
pull
off
a
reverse
transpossession
what
do
we
do
we've
gotta
get
those
possessed
students
over
to
the
hyena
cage
right
away
i'll
meet
you
there
we
can
begin
the
rituals
wwell
we
can
guarantee
one
of
them
but
there
are
four
more
and
we
have
no
idea
where
they
are
no
i
wouldn't
worry
about
that
after
hyenas
feed
and
rest
they
will
track
the
missing
member
of
their
pack

they
find
him
