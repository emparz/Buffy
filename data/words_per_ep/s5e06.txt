better
the
kitten
runs
offscreen
cut

a
shot
of
her
trying
to
crawl
under
a
bed
'cause
one
day
the
kitty
was
running
around
in
the
street
and
a
man
came
and
swooped
her
up
a
pair
of
hands
comes
into
the
shot
and
swoops
up
the
kitten
and
took
her
to
the
pound

tara
sitting
on
the
end
of
willow's
bed
lifting
the
kitten
into
her
lap
willow
is
in
the

fun
giles
reading
a
book
people
help
each
other
out
anya
it's
one
of
our
strange
customs
giles
i
noticed
you're
doing
the
smallest
amount
of
helping
that
can
actually
be
called
helping
well
i
saw
myself
in
more
of
a
patriarchal
sort
of
role
you
know
lots
of
pointing
and
scowling
giles
smiles
looks
to
his
left
points
and
scowls
you
two
stop

riley
grappling
bent

xander
has
riley
in
a
headlock
he
started
it
he
called
me
a
bad
name
xander
tara
looks
at

suddenly
let
each
other
go
and
straighten
up
we
see
willow
and
tara
folding
clothes
smiling
at
each
other
still
can't
believe
you're

up
this
cherry
corner
suite
anya
reentering

just
a
few
days
after

clothes
to
put
in
a
box
just

pointing
to
the
two
doors

answer
is
somewhere
here
xander
stares
at
the
bookcovered
table
it's
right
in
front
of
us
and
we're
too
blind
to
see
it
xander
slams
his
hand
down
on
the
table
buffy
gives
him
an
exasperated
look

few
minutes
xander
jerks
his
thumb
toward
the
training
room
in

back
train
or

her
butt
and
buffy
wraps
her
legs
around
his
neck

roomful
of
witchy
stuff
the
door

little
early
mr

mr

picks
up
a
large
crystal
and
examines
it
toys
mr
maclay
puts
crystal
down
you
don't
even
try
to
hide
it
anymore
i'd
hoped
maybe
you'd
gotten
over
the
whole
witchcraft
thing
that
if
we
let
you
go
you'd
get
it
out
of
your
system
mr
maclay
puts
hands
in
pockets

to
look
for
you
in

mr

to
happen
you
have
evil
inside
of
you
and
it
will
come
out
and
letting
yourself
work
all
this
magic
is
only
going
to
make
it
worse

power
comes
from
it
it
doesn't
feel
evil

does
mr
maclay
tara
looks
down
upset
i

mr
maclay
starts
to
walk
past
her
i'll
give
you
some
time
but
we
need
to
be
gone
by
morning
mr
maclay
walks
to
the
door
we
see
him
unfocused
in
the
background
in
foreground
tara
looking
sad
your
family
loves
you
tara
no
matter
what
how
do
you
think
your
friends
are
going
to
feel
when
they
see
your
true
face
cut
to
the
leiach
demon
asleep
or
unconscious
something
hits
its
face
and
it
begins
to
wake
the
camera
pulls
back
slowly
and
we
see
that
the
demon
is
standing
chained
to
a
clothesrack
surrounded
by
fur
coats
its
nose
twitches
a
shoe
flies
into
the
shot
and
hits
the
demon
in
the
face
and
it
growls
glory
os
finally
i
thought
you
were
gonna
nap
the
whole
day
away
glory
demon
growls
and
struggles
stop
whining
we
see
that
they're
in
a
large
walkin
closet
with
clothes
racks
on
all
four
walls
glory
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
room
now
wearing
a
shiny
green
leather
dress
she
has
her
previous
red
dress
on
a
hanger
which
she
now
hangs
up
you
know
i
remember
when
the
leiach
were
a
proud
warrior
race
not
sneaking
around
hospitals
looking
for
weak
sickly
types
to
suck
the
bone
marrow
from
glory
demon
growls
and
struggles
but
let's
talk
about
my
problems
for
thirty
seconds
if
that's
perfectly
all
right
with
you
she
walks
toward
the
demon
and
we
see
a
vanity
table
against
one
wall
glory
kneels
on
the
chair
leans
her
hands
on
the
table
and
talks
to
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
blonde
short
strong
for
a
human

glory
turns
back
around
sits
on
chair
speaks
angrily
to
demon
and
massively
rude
broke
my
shoe
took
my
monk
do
you
have
any
idea
who
i'm
talking
about
the
demon
growls
and
grunts
a
slayer
oh
god
please
don't
tell
me
i
was
fighting
a
vampire
slayer
glory
puts
one
hand
to
her
forehead
how
unbelievably
common
if
i
had
friends
and
they
heard
about
this

glory
shot
of
the
demon
looking
like
it's
going
to
fall
asleep
again
and
you
know
she's
going
around
telling
everybody
i
mean
she
probably
just
glory
leaps
up
and
grabs
the
demon
by
the
throat
pay
attention
i
am
great
and
i
am
beautiful
and
when
i
walk
into
a
room
all
eyes
turn
to
me
because
my
name
is
a
holy
name
and
you
will
listen
glory
removes
her
hand
from
demon's
throat
strokes
his
hair
with
both
hands
get
your
friends
find
the
girl

the
girl

demon
nods
she
smiles
and
looks
closer
at
it

suppurating
sores

anyone
ever
told
you
that
cut
to
some
sort
of
irregularly
shaped
crystal
ball
camera
pulls
out

floating
into

very
dirty
look

happy
now
a
slow
smile
spreads
across
tara's
face
as
fast
rock
music
begins
cut
to
the
bronze
a
montage
of
scenes
of
the
whole
group
wearing
party
clothes
talking
and
laughing
in
different
groups
xander
giving
tara
a
drink
buffy
talking
with
someone
willow
laughing
at
xander's
joke
dawn
racing
through
the
crowd
and
buffy
stopping
her
willow
blowing
bubbles
while
tara
opens
her
presents
admiring
the
crystal
ball
from
giles
dawn
running
up
to
tara
holding
a
broom
with
a
bow
tied
around
it
a
bunch
of
them
hanging
out
talking
playing
pool
cut
to
buffy
leaning
against
a
pole
watching
the
action
with
a
smile
behind
her
the
door
opens
and
riley
enters
with
a
gift
box
under
his
arm
he
goes
up
to
buffy

they
kiss
cut
to
tara
talking
to
anya
who
wears
a
party
hat
no
see
'cause
your
insect
reflection
represents
your
insignificance
tara
anya
nods
in
terms
of
the
karmic
cycle
anya
nods
to
show
that
she
understands
then
ponders
it
for
a
moment
but
it's
still
not
funny
cut
to
xander
buffy
dawn
and
giles
talking
together
riley
comes
over
with
three
blue
plastic
cups
gives
one
to
buffy
and
one
to
giles
we
see
that
xander
already
has
a
cup
dawn
with
her
back
to
the
others
watching
the
crowd
this
place
is
so
cool
dawn
looks
at
hand
'cept
i
have
to
wear
this
stupid
stamp
on
my
hand
that's
to
keep
you
from
boozing
it
up
oh
please
only
losers
drink
alcohol
a
beat
as
the
others
take
this
in
the
cups
they're
all
holding
are
prominently
visible
dawn
is
cheerfully
oblivious
cut
back
to
tara
and
anya
so
what's
an
eagle
reflection
umm
willow
approaches
my
dance
she
takes
tara's
hand
and
leads
her
onto
the
floor
as
a
slow
song
starts
they
begin
to
dance
willow
has
her
hands
on
tara's
waist
tara's
hands
on
willow's
shoulders
good
birthday
best
birthday
i
still
can't
believe
you
didn't
tell
me
about
your
family
and
all
that
i
was
just
afraid
if
you
saw
the
kind
of
people
i
came
from
you
wouldn't
wanna
be
anywhere
near
me
see
that's
where
you're
a
dummy
i
think
about
what
you
grew
up
with
and
then
i
look
at
what
you
are
it
makes
me
proud
it
makes
me
love
you
more
every
time
i
tara
takes
a
deep
breath
even
when
i'm
at
my
worst
you
always
make
me
feel
special
willow
smiles
how
do
you
do
that
magic
they
embrace
putting
their
heads
on
each
other's
shoulders
and
swaying
to
the
music
i
can't
take
my
eyes
off
you
i
can't
take
my
eyes
off
you
this
line
of
song
repeats
several
more
times
as
they
continue
slowly
moving
to
the
music
and
the
camera
moves
around
them
we
see
them
slowly
rising
upward
long
shot
of
willow
and
tara
surrounded
by
other
couples
who
are
also
dancing
but
willow
and
tara
are
floating
several
feet
above
the
floor
blackout
joss
whedon
