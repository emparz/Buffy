prologue

a
sunnydale
cemetery
faith
and
buffy
both
fall
backwards
onto
the
mound
of
a
fresh
grave
fighting
a
pair
of
leatheruniformed
vampires
but
this
doesn't
stop
faith
from
wanting
to
continue
her
conversation
with
buffy
faith
to
buffy
struggling
so
what
you're
telling
me
never
buffy
also
struggling
faith
really
now
is
not
the
time
i'm
curious
never
ever
the
two
slayers
both
kick
up
with
their
legs
and
send
the
vampires
rolling
over
and
off
of
them
and
then
do
back
rolls
up
to
a
standing
position
faith
to
buffy
come
on
really
all
this
time
and
not
even
once
she
blocks
a
high
punch
from
her
assailant
grabs
onto
his
shoulder
and
flips
him
forward
he
lands
hard
on
his
back
how
many
times
do
i
have
to
say
it
she
ducks
a
swing
i
have
never
she
does
a
backhand
punch
at
her
attacker
done
it
the
vampire
staggers
backward
into
a
lamppost
from
the
force
of
her
punch
buffy
does
a
full
spin
toward
him
with
xander
she
jams
her
stake
home
and
the
demon
bursts
into
ashes
buffy
looks
over
at
faith
still
fighting
he's
just
a
friend
faith
leaps
at
her
assailant
does
a
log
roll
in
midair
and
comes
down
hard
on
him
with
her
knee
digging
into
his
back
shoving
him
into
the
ground
she
raises
her
stake
and
plunges
it
into
his
back
dusting
him
instantly
she
gets
up
and
steps
over
to
meet
up
with
buffy
so
what
are
friends
for
i
mean
i'm
sorry
faith
smiles
sexily
it's
just
all
this
sweatingnightly
sidebyside
action
and
you
never
put
in
for
a
little
afterhours
faith
thrusts
her
pelvis
forward
and
grunts

buffy
raises
her
eyebrows
thanks
for
the
poetry
and
no
i
love
xander
i
just
don't
love
xander
buffy
looks
at
the
ground
besides
i
think
it
ruins
friendship
to
do
that
stuff
she
takes
a
closer
look
at
the
boot
prints
on
the
muddy
ground
you
think
too
much
faith
starts
to
leave
buffy
grabs
faith's
arm
looking
down
hey
there's
one
more
how
do
you
know
i
think
too
much
the
two
of
them
start
to
walk
following
the
extra
set
of
prints
which
lead
behind
a
gravestone
buffy
quietly
okay
count
of
three
one
faith
jumps
ahead
and
shoulderrolls
over
the
gravestone
the
vampire
isn't
there
but
he
comes
running
at
her
he
is
also
dressed
in
the
leather
uniform
buffy
disapprovingly
watches
the
fight
start
three
faith
tries
to
do
a
roundhouse
kick
at
the
vampire
but
he
catches
her
leg
right
before
it
connects
with
his
head
he
grabs
her
shoulder
spins
halfway
around
and
throws
her
against
a
tall
gravestone
she
hits
the
ground
hard
and
immediately
starts
to
get
back
up
buffy
runs
around
them
to
catch
the
demon
from
behind
as
he
looks
down
at
faith
and
pulls
out
two
swords
one
with
a
long
blade
the
other
short
he
hears
buffy
coming
though
and
spins
his
head
around
to
see
her
she
stops
in
her
tracks
holding
her
stake
up
in
her
hand
the
vampire
swings
his
long
sword
in
a
wide
arc
and
slices
off
the
tip
of
the
stake
buffy
jumps
in
surprise
but
quickly
drops
what's
left
of
the
stake
as
the
vampire
swings
his
sword
down
on
her
she
high
blocks
the
attack
with
her
left
arm
grabs
his
left
arm
with
her
right
hand
grabs
his
right
arm
with
her
left
hand
and
brings
both
of
his
arms
down
hard
forcing
him
to
drop
the
swords
she
high
punches
him
in
the
head
and
tries
to
follow
up
with
a
double
roundhouse
kick
with
alternating
legs
the
vampire
knifehand
blocks
both
kicks
he
gains
the
upper
hand
grabbing
buffy
by
the
shoulders
and
tries
to
get
in
closer
for
a
bite
she
struggles
to
keep
him
at
bay
finally
faith
runs
up
behind
him
and
thrusts
her
stake
into
his
back
he
screams
and
throws
up
his
hands
then
crumbles
to
ashes
between
the
two
girls
leaving
faith
smiling
at
buffy
and
buffy
leaning
against
a
gravestone
catching
her
breath
faith
takes
a
step
toward
her
raising
her
hand
for
a
high
five
nicely
diverted
b
she
stops
midstep
when
buffy
doesn't
return
the
gesture
buffy
panting
diverted
that
was
me
fighting
for
my
life
miss
attention
span
faith
sighs
and
turns
to
go
this
isn't
a
tupperware
party
it's
a
little
hard
to
plan
buffy
follows
the
count
of
three
isn't
a
plan
it's
sesame
street
faith
stops
and
faces
buffy
hey
they're
toast
and
we're
here
so
it
couldn't
have
been
too
bad
right
faith
checks
her
arm
who
were
those
guys
anyways
i
don't
know
buffy
sniffs
they
didn't
seem
local
buffy
looks
where
the
swords
were
look
why
don't
we
grab
the
weapons
maybe
giles
the
swords
aren't
there
anymore
buffy
gives
faith
a
confused
look
cut
to
the
mayor's
office
mr
trick
drops
the
two
swords
on
his
desk
check
these
out
the
mayor
is
busy
reading
the
funnies
and
ignores
him
while
he
finishes
reading
his
favorite
strip
mayor
wilkins
chuckles
and
shakes
his
head
i
i
just
love
the
family
circus
that
pj
he's
getting
to
be
quite
a
handful
he
drops
the
paper
on
his
desk
allan
gives
him
an
acknowledging
nod
and
weak
smile
the
mayor
now
looks
at
the
swords
lying
on
his
desk
well
i
haven't
seen
anything
like
this
in
uh
mayor
wilkins
looks
up
at
allan
well
a
good
long
while
mayor
wilkins
to
trick
where's
the
owner
of
these
fine
implements
the
common
term
is
'slain'
but
i've
been
seeing
this
breed
around
are
we
expecting
any
trouble
mayor
wilkins
smiles
up
at
trick
do
you
like
family
circus
trick
seriously
i
like
marmaduke
mayor
wilkins
disgusted
oh
mayor
wilkins
shivers
eww
he's
always
on
the
furniture
unsanitary
nobody
can
tell
marmaduke
what
to
do
trick
grins
that's
my
kinda
dog
allan
smiling
eagerly
i
like
to
read
cathy
mr
trick
and
the
mayor
both
give
him
a
look
allan
swallows
nervously
so
uh
what
abbout
these
swords
wwhat
should
we
do
about
that
mayor
wilkins
inspects
them
well
let's
just
keep
an
eye
out
we've
got
the
dedication
coming
up
in
a
few
days
we
certainly
can't
have
anything
interfering
with
that
allan
fidgeting
well
maybe
we
should
postpone
the
thethe
dedication
the
mayor
gives
him
an
incredulous
look
trick
looks
at
him
intensely
i
believe
the
honorable
mayor
hates
that
idea
mayor
wilkins
stands
up
the
dedication
mayor
wilkins
walks
toward
the
liquor
cabinet
is
the
final
step
before
my
ascension
mayor
wilkins
allan
jumps
out
of
his
way
i
have
waited
longer
than
you
can
imagine
for
this
mayor
wilkins
opens
the
cabinet
opens
a
box
of
moist
towelettes
after
the
hundred
days
mayor
wilkins
pulls
out
a
towelette
i'll
be
on
a
higher
plane
mayor
wilkins
steps
back
to
allan
wiping
his
hands
and
i'll
have
no
more
need
for
mayor
wilkins
folds
up
the
used
towelette
well
let's
just
say
i
won't
be
concerned
with
the
little
things
mayor
wilkins
holds
it
up
to
allan
who
takes
it
and
goes
back
to
his
desk
mr
trick
watch
these
people
anything
you
find
out
about
them
well
let's
just
see
that
that
information
reaches
the
slayers
mayor
wilkins
takes
the
short
sword
from
trick
looks
it
over
who
knows
with
any
luck
they'll
kill
each
other
then
everyone's
a
winner
mayor
wilkins
looks
at
allan
everyone
of
course
meaning
me
mayor
wilkins
chuckles

buffy's
theme
plays
part
1

sunnydale
high
school
willow
what
are
these
they're
early
admission
packets
cut
to
the
student
lounge
xander
and
oz
are
sitting
on
one
of
the
couches
across
from
willow
and
buffy
on
the
other
the
table
between
them
is
piled
up
with
college
acceptance
letters
and
application
forms
xander
goes
through
a
stack
of
them
reading
off
the
university
names
harvard
yale
wesleyan
some
german
polytechnical
institute
whose
name
i
uh
xander
tries
to
read
it
i
can't
pronounce
xander
drops
the
packets
leans
back
is
anyone
else
intimidated
xander
looks
at
oz
'cause
i'm
just
expecting
thin
slips
of
paper
with
the
words
'no
way'
written
in
crayon
they're
typing
those
now
xander
nods
hmm
willow
and
buffy
are
paging
through
some
of
the
brochures
willow
smiling
i'm
so
overwhelmed
ii
got
in
to
actual
colleges
and
aand
they're
wooing
me
they're
pitching
woo
buffy
smiles
the
wooing
stage
is
always
fun
willow
sighs
but
it's
weird
now
rejection
i
can
handle
'cause
of
the
years
of
training
but
this
i
feel
your
pain
will
like
right
now
i'm
torn
between
the
fastgrowing
fields
of
appliance
repair
and
motel
management
of
course
i'm
still
waiting
to
hear
back
from
the
uh
corndog
emporium
so
he
crosses
his
fingers
and
then
holds
his
hands
together
in
a
sarcastic
gesture
of
prayer
buffy
gives
him
a
giggle
well
i
think
it's
great
early
admission
buffy
to
willow
now
there's
nothing
standing
between
you
and
a
brilliant
future
well
if
i
may
suggest
graduate
gettin'
left
back
not
the
thrill
ride
you'd
expect
cordelia
approaches
from
behind
the
boys
that's
so
cute
planning
life
as
a
loser
cordelia
xander
glances
up
at
her
most
people
just
turn
out
that
way
but
you're
really
taking
charge
the
comedy
stylings
of
miss
cordelia
chase
everyone
xander
looks
up
at
her
who
uh
incidentally
won't
be
needing
a
higher
education
when
she
markets
her
own
very
successful
line
of
hooker
wear
he
checks
out
her
outfit
which
is
typically
revealing
well
xander
i
could
dress
more
like
you
but
cordelia
in
mock
sympathy
oh
my
father
has
a
job
she
immediately
leaves
xander
watches
her
go
once
again
having
nothing
to
say
i'm
not
gonna
waste
the
perfect
comeback
on
you
now
xander
points
at
her
but
don't
think
i
don't
have
it
xander
miffed
oh
yes
its
time
will
come
he
turns
back
to
the
group
and
pretends
cordelia
doesn't
exist
so
life
beyond
high
school
xander
fishes
for
sympathy
anyone
please
chime
in
i
hear
it's
nice
and
a
place
i'll
never
go
if
i
don't
pass
mrs
taggart's
chemistry

at

willow
slightly
concerned
he's
looked
better
cut
to
the
library
giles
is
sitting
on
the
study
table
facing
the
doors
with
his
arms
crossed
and
looking
very
bored
while
a
somewhat
foppish
well
tailored
young
man
goes
through
some
books
in
a
box
on
the
table
of
course
training
procedures
have
been
updated
quite
a
bit
since
your
day
much
greater
emphasis
on
field
work
giles
very
bored
really
oh
yes
wesley
walks
around
to
another
box
not
all
books
and
theory
nowadays
wesley
reaches
in
for
some
books
i
have
in
fact
faced
two
vampires
myself
under
controlled
circumstances
of
course
giles
uncrosses
his
arms
well
no
danger
of
finding
those
here
wesley
looks
up
vampires
controlled
circumstances
giles
sees
buffy
enter
hello
buffy
wesley
overhears
looks
at
her
and
smiles
condescendingly
well
wesley
steps
to
the
head
of
the
table
hello
wesley
smiles
smugly
buffy
gives
him
a
quick
look
up
and
down
buffy
to
giles
new
watcher
new
watcher
wesley
takes
a
step
toward
her
and
holds
out
his
hand
in
greeting
wesley
wyndampryce
buffy
makes
no
move
to
return
the
gesture
but
continues
to
eye
him
critically
a
moment
later
he
steps
back
again
it's
very
nice
to
meet
you
buffy
steps
over
to
giles
never
removing
her
eyes
from
wesley
is
he
evil
wesley
perplexed
evil
the
last
one
was
evil
wesley
thoughtfully
oh
yes
gwendolyn
post
we
all
heard
no
mr
giles
has
checked
my
credentials
rather
thoroughly
and
phoned
the
council
but
i'm
glad
to
see
you're
on
the
ball
as
well
wesley
takes
a
secretive
step
toward
her
a
good
slayer
is
a
cautious
slayer
wesley
steps
back
buffy
to
giles
is
he
evil
not
in
the
strictest
sense
well
i'm
glad
that's
cleared
up
wesley
walks
around
the
table
as
i'm
sure
none
of
us
is
anxious
to
waste
any
time
on
pleasantries
wesley
picks
up
his
watcher
diary
why
don't
you
tell
me
everything
about
last
night's
patrol
wesley
flips
to
a
blank
page
vampires
wesley
inquiringly
yes
killed
'em
wesley
fishing
for
details
anything
else
you
can
tell
me
buffy
glances
at
giles
he
nods
that
she
should
cooperate
uh
buffy
thinks
one
of
them
had
swords
i
don't
think
he
was
with
the
other
two
wesley
something
clicks
swords
he
sets
down
his
diary
goes
back
to
his
box
of
books
and
begins
to
rifle
through
them
swords
he
finds
the
book
he
wants
and
begins
to
leaf
through
it
one
long
one
short
mmm
both
pointy
buffy
to
giles
with
like
jewels
and
things
sounds
familiar
wesley
comes
back
with
the
book
it
should
he
holds
it
out
in
front
of
giles
who
takes
it
and
reads
el
eliminati
fifteenth
century
wesley
interrupts
fifteenth
century
duelist
cult
deadly
in
their
day
their
numbers
dwindled
in
later
centuries
due
to
an
increase
in
antivampire
activity
and
a
lot
of
pointless
dueling
buffy
and
giles
both
look
up
at
him
surprised
by
his
rudeness
they
eventually
became
the
acolytes
of
a
demon
called
balthazar
who
brought
them
to
the
new
world
specifically
here
giles
closes
the
book
hands
it
back
you
seem
to
know
a
lot
about
them
i
didn't
get
this
job
because
of
my
looks
wesley
goes
back
to
his
box
i
really
really
believe
that
buffy
nods
wesley
looks
at
her
snidely
i've
researched
this
town's
history
extensively
so
why
have
we
not
seen
them
before
this
wesley
comes
back
they
were
driven
out
a
hundred
years
ago
happily
balthazar
was
killed
i
don't
know
by
whom
and
they're
back
'cause
balthazar
had
an
amulet
purported
to
give
him
strength
when
he
was
killed
it
was
taken
by
a
wealthy
landowner
named
wesley
sees
their
looks
i
don't
want
to
bore
you
with
the
details
a
little
bit
late
named
gleaves
it
was
buried
with
him
and
i
believe
the
few
remaining
eliminati
are
probably
looking
for
it
for
sentimental
value
aand
you
don't
think
that
this
uh
amulet
poses
any
threat
wesley
steps
back
to
his
box
oh
no
not
at
all
nonetheless
we
may
as
well
keep
it
from
them
buffy
you
will
go
to
the
gleaves
family
crypt
tonight
and
fetch
the
amulet
wesley
reaches
in
i
will
wesley
pauses
are
you
not
used
to
being
given
orders
whenever
giles
sends
me
on
a
mission
he
always
says
'please'
and
afterwards
i
get
a
cookie
she
grins
at
giles
who
smiles
back
modestly
wesley
comes
back
i
don't
feel
we're
getting
off
on
quite
the
right
foot
just
then
they
hear
footsteps
and
look
up
to
see
faith
walk
in
ah
this
is
perhaps
faith
faith
stops
and
critically
looks
wesley
up
and
down
new
watcher
new
watcher
faith
snickers
screw
that
she
turns
right
around
and
walks
out
wesley
feels
put
off
buffy
to
giles
now
why
didn't
i
just
say
that
giles
gently
uh

slips
off
of
the
table
and
walks
out

terribly
interesting
while
i'm
gone
wesley
watches

go
he
and
giles

reach
into
their
pockets
for
handkerchiefs
take
off
their
glasses
and
begin
to
clean
them

get
used
to
me
giles
notices
their
tandem
actions
immediately
stops
cleaning
and
puts
his
glasses
back
on
before
wesley
has
a
chance
to
turn
around
when
he
does
giles
just
smiles
up
at
him
covering
his
handkerchief
with
his
hands
cut
to
the
quad
buffy
catches
up
with
faith
as
they
come
walking
around
a
corner
faith
wait
look
i
know
this
new
guy's
a
dork
but
buffy
pauses
well
i
have
nothing
to
follow
that
he's
pretty
much
just
a
dork
you're
actually
gonna
take
orders
from
him
that's
the
job
what
else
can
we
do
whatever
we
want
we're
slayers
girlfriend
the
chosen
two
why
should
we
let
him
take
all
the
fun
out
of
it
oh
that
would
be
tragic
taking
the
fun
out
of
slaying
stabbing
beheading
oh
like
you
don't
dig
it
buffy
shrugs
i
don't
you're
a
liar
i've
seen
you
tell
me
staking
a
vamp
doesn't
get
you
a
little
bit
juiced
come
on
say
it
she
stops
and
folds
her
arms
waiting
for
buffy's
answer
buffy
can't
help
but
smile
and
looks
down
to
hide
it
faith
laughs
you
can't
fool
me
the
look
in
your
eyes
right
after
a
kill
you
just
get
hungry
for
more
buffy
shakes
her
head
you're
way
off
base
tell
me
that
if
you
don't
get
in
a
good
slaying
after
a
while
you
just
start
itching
for
some
vamp
to
show
up
so
you
can
give
him
a
good
faith
grunts
and
punches

again
with
the
grunting
you
realize
i'm
not
comfortable
with
this
hey
slaying's
what
we
were
built
for
if
you're
not
enjoying
it
you're
doing
something
wrong
faith
starts
to
leave
buffy
sighs
what
about
the
assignment
faith
looks
back
tell
you
what
faith
points
you
do
the
homework
and
i'll
copy
yours
faith
grins
and
goes
cut
to
the
gleaves
family
crypt
that
night
buffy
slowly
walks
up
to
it
and
turns
on
her
maglite
she
steps
up
to
the
door
and
opens
it
cut
inside
the
large
room
is
dark
and
dusty
in
the
center
are
two
stone
coffins
there
are
several
drawers
on
one
wall
and
a
few
urns
on
shelves
buffy
takes
the
steps
down
into
the
room
and
goes
to
the
first
coffin
she
pushes
the
heavy
lid
aside
and
looks
into
it
with
the
flashlight
all
that's
left
of
the
body
is
the
skeleton
and
a
pile
of
hair
and
fibers
strike
one
no
amulet
there
she
goes
to
the
next
coffin
and
pushes
its
lid
aside
the
body
in
this
one
has
dried
out
and
looks
mummified
the
clothes
are
still
more
or
less
intact
and
around
its
neck
hangs
the
amulet
game
over
she
reaches
in
for
it
but
jerks
back
up
when
she
hears
noises
coming
from
outside
through
the
door
she
sees
torches
coming
closer
and
hears
voices
she
quickly
jumps
up
onto
the
first
coffin
rolls
into
it
and
twists
off
her
maglite
just
as
vincent
the
leader
of
the
eliminati
pushes
the
door
open
he
looks
around
but
doesn't
notice
when
buffy
pulls
the
lid
of
the
coffin
back
into
place
vincent
walks
down
the
stairs
and
goes
over
to
the
open
coffin
his
troops
follow
him
inside
her
coffin
buffy
looks
over
at
the
skull
beside
her
but
remains
quiet
vincent
looks
into
the
open
coffin
sees
the
amulet
and
yanks
it
from
the
body's
neck
he
takes
a
good
look
at
it
and
smiles
at
his
troops
indicating
success
for
their
mission
in
the
other
coffin
buffy
remains
absolutely
still
the
eliminati
start
to
make
their
way
out
when
buffy
hears
the
door
close
she
pushes
the
lid
back
open
and
climbs
out
only
to
be
startled
by
faith's
hand
on
her
shoulder
faith
what
are
you
doing
hiding
in
there
looking
for
the
amulet
wasn't
counting
on
the
special
guest
stars
six
against
one
buffy
gestures
at
the
coffin
hence
the
hiding
well
it's
six
against
two
now
so
come
on
she
rushes
out
of
the
crypt
buffy
climbs
out
of
the
coffin
and
follows
her
out
cut
outside
they
come
out
in
time
to
see
the
last
two
eliminati
jump
down
through
a
manhole
into
the
sewers
below
faith
makes
tracks
for
it
wait
stop
think
faith
stops
defiantly
no
no
no
faith
starts
again
buffy
chases
her
it's
a
manhole
tight
space
no
escape
six
against
two
not
unlike
three
against
one
and
there
might
be
more
faith
grabs
buffy's
arm
so
come
on
faith
lets
go
you're
just
gonna
go
down
there
that's
your
plan
who
said
i
had
a
plan
i
don't
know
how
many's
down
there
but
i
wanna
find
out
and
i'll
know
when
i
land
if
you
don't
come
in
after
me
faith
shrugs
and
smiles
i
might
die
without
any
further
hesitation
she
jumps
in
buffy
can't
believe
it
but
realizes
she
can't
let
her
do
it
alone
and
jumps
in
after
her
part

and

of
her
though
and
tries
to
thrust
at
her
with
his
short
sword
she
jerks
out
of
the
way
in
time
and
grabs
hold
of
his
arm
but
he
uses
this
to
his
advantage
and
grabs
her
around
the
back
with
his
other
arm
pinning
her
against
the
edge
of
the
pool
well
then
let's
just
settle
it
he
dunks
her
head
into
the
water
she
struggles
to
get
back
up
but
can't
get
a
good
grip
on
anything
in
the
filthy
water
in
the
meantime
another
vampire
gets
faith
in
a
full
nelson
hold
she
sees
buffy
struggling
in
the
water
buffy
faith
struggles
with
her
assailant
you
son
of
a
bitch
vincent
keeps
holding
buffy's
head
under
water
she
struggles
valiantly
to
get
up
but
just
can't
it
isn't
much
longer
before
she
starts
to
get
weak
from
lack
of
oxygen
and
stops
struggling
apparently
passing
out
vincent
holds
her
under
for
another
few
seconds
then
lets
go
and
turns
his
attention
to
faith
buffy
remains
motionless
in
the
water
vincent
grins
widely
at
faith
who
keeps
struggling
but
to
no
avail
suddenly
buffy
leaps
up
vincent's
long
sword
in
hand
and
swings
it
around
at
his
head
he's
too
quick
though
and
ducks
it
but
is
left
off
balance
in
a
crouch
i
hate
it
when
they
drown
me
she
swings
at
him
again
but
he
reacts
instantly
somersaulting
out
of
the
way
and
back
to
his
feet
he
faces
her
wielding
his
short
sword
she
makes
quick
work
of
it
knocking
it
out
of
his
hand
with
her
first
swing
she
swings
at
him
again
widely
but
he
manages
to
dodge
her
faith
breaks
out
of
the
nelson
hold
spins
around
and
punches
the
vampire
in
the
face
he
staggers
against
the
wall
she
grabs
him
and
pulls
him
around
and
he
flies
up
and
over
the
small
raised
area
b
gotta
go
buffy
misses
another
swing
but
has
a
determined
look
on
her
face
we
came
for
the
amulet
she
jabs
the
sword
straight
at
vincent
getting
the
tip
right
between
the
chain
holding
the
amulet
at
his
waist
she
lifts
the
sword
drawing
the
chain
out
from
under
his
belt
and
it
slides
down
the
length
of
the
blade
to
the
hilt
vincent
is
freaked
by
her
accuracy
and
hightails
it
out
of
there
buffy
pulls
the
amulet
from
the
sword
and
holds
it
in
her
hand
faith
comes
up
next
to
her

heavily

good
thank
you
for
asking

gives
wesley
a
look
making
it
very
clear

a
few
more
than
we'd
anticipated

i'd
expect

buffy
xander's
eye

three
of
them
on

at
once
hey

buffy's
'ode

later
like
when

multiplechoicing
buffy
realizes
how

your
eye
twitches
every
time
i
say
faith's
name
xander
twitches
his
eye
xander
defensively
what
xander
chuckles

buffy
leans
in
closer
to

finally
realizes
that

allowed
to
continue
her
story
and
settles
down
to
take
her
test
she
opens
the
booklet
but
is
interrupted
along
with
the
rest
of
the

by
faith

on
the
window

trying
to
get
buffy's
attention
faith
lifts
the

the
dust
from

sleeve
exhales
to
fog
it
and
uses
her
index
fingers
to
draw
a
heart
with
a
stake
through
it
she
looks
at
buffy
smiles
and
bounces
her
eyebrows
buffy
considers
for
only
a
moment
before
deciding
to
blow
off
the
test
she
slides
down
from
her
lab
stool
and
heads
for
the
window
willow
and
xander

smiles
and
leans
back
in
to
wait
for

buffy
ignores
her
and
climbs
out
of
the
window

rays
of

over
the
floor
waiting
out

day

and
faith
kick
in
the
door
bright
sunlight
washes
in
and
onto
one
of
them
who
quickly
bursts
into
flames

feet
and
begin
to
run

slayers

into
the
nest

and
shine
people
it's
your
wakeup
call
they
both
pull
out
stakes
and
run
in
for
a
good
fight
cut
to
the
bronze
that
evening
faith
and
buffy
are
on
the
dance
floor
gyrating
to
the
hard
techno
sound
of
chinese
burn
performed
by
curve
three
boys
come
over
to
them
and
dance
around
them
the
camera
shows
a
brief
view
from
above
of
the
two
girls
surrounded
by
the
boys
they
pretty
much
ignore
the
guys
and
just
hump
the
air
around
them
angel
walks
under
the
stairs
to
the
edge
of
the
dance
floor
and
stops
to
watch
a
look
of
deep
concern
on
his
face
the
camera
shows
another
brief
shot
of
them
from
above
eventually
buffy
notices
angel
standing
at
the
side
when
he
sees
her
notice
he
makes
a
move
to
go
buffy
squeezes
out
from
the
crowd
to
go
to
him
faith
doesn't
miss
a
beat
and
starts
to
paw
at
the
boys
keeping
them
well
entertained
she
burns
friends
like
a
piece
of
wood
when
buffy
reaches
angel
she
jumps
up
on
him
and
wraps
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
her
legs
around
his
hips
angel
supports
her
at
the
waist
hey
you're
not
leaving

you
and
she's
jealous
of
me
because
she
never
could
angel
lyrics
glances
over
at
faith
and
the
boys
i
saw
you

friends
buffy
glances
dismissively
them
hold
herself
up
without
a
spine
buffy
lyrics
faces
him
smiling
boys
i
like
you
and
she'll
look
me
up
when
she's
doing
fine
angel
reacts
in
his
usual
somber
way
buffy
hops
down
off
of
him
buffy
coyly
teasing
what's
the
matter

not
afraid
of
little
me

ya
angel
seriously

down
come
on
he
leads
her
away
to
a
small
alcove
behind
the
stairs
i
can
sense

is
a
business
trip
angel
sits
buffy
plops
down
next
to
him
buffy
flippantly
what's
the
what
balthazar
buffy
snuggles
close
to
him
dead
demon
not
as
dead
as
you
think
he
gets
up
and
sits
across
from
her
putting
some
distance
between
them
word
on
the
street
puts
him
in
the
packing
warehouse
on
devereau
he's
looking
for
his
amulet
it's
supposed
to
restore
his
strength
from
what
i'm
hearing
that's
not
something
we'd
like
to
see
happen
no
problem
we
got
the
amulet

know
i
spoke
to
giles
but
he
said

his
head
around
the
stairs
and
finds
them

points
accusingly
ah

really
annoying
person

certainly
giving
me
a
run
for
my
money
wesley
sits
next
to
her
whispers

that

me
a
number
where
i
can
contact
you
where's

around
and
looks
at

in
surprise
who

friend

you
have
it
wesley
smugly
it's
somewhere
safe
buffy
looks
at
his
jacket
reaches
in
and
pulls
out
the
amulet
how
did

jacket
she
tosses
it
to
angel
wesley
protests
now

on
a
minute

holds

up

angel
leans
over
and
gives
buffy
a
kiss
be
careful
you
know
me
angel
sternly
i
mean
it
they
both
go
in
opposite
directions
leaving
wesley
behind
and
very
confused
what's
going
on
buffy
walks
onto
the
dance
floor
and
grabs
faith
she
pulls
her
out
of
the
crowd
and
toward
the
door
faith
lets
herself
be
led
away
but
points
back
at
the
boys

me
the
guys
are
bummed
to
see
her
go
cut
to
the
packing
warehouse
let
me
tell
you
what
i
see
cut
inside
balthazar
is
enormously
obese
with
very
pale
pasty
slimy
skin
he
sits
suspended
in
a
tank
of
filthy
water
while
one
of
the
eliminati
pours
ladle
after
ladle
of
it
over
him
in
an
effort
to
keep
his
skin
moist
i
see
fear
and
remorse
and
the
pitiful
look
of
faces
that
cry
out
for
mercy
but
what
i
don't
see
is
what
i
want
to
see
and
that's
my
amulet
lord
balthazar
we
found
it
we
had
it
but
the
slayers
already
i'm
bored
he
holds
out
his
hands
and
the
air
between
him
and
the
vampires
is
suddenly
disturbed
the
vampire
floats
involuntarily
over
to
balthazar
who
grabs
his
throat
and
squeezes
until
his
neck
breaks
and
he
slumps
lifelessly
to
the
floor
vincent
watches
extremely
worried
that
he
may
be
next
vincent
come
here
he
wheezes
hard
as
vincent
slowly
approaches
closer
vincent
leans
toward
him
closer
vincent
leans
close
enough
to
be
spat
upon
balthazar
puts
his
hands
on
vincent's
shoulders
let
me
tell
you
what
i
want
to
see
cut
outside

and
buffy
look
for
the
packing
warehouse
and
find
it
they
look
in
through
a
crack
in
the
door
and
see
balthazar
surrounded
by
the
eliminati
okay
we
got
ten
maybe
twelve
bad
guys
and
one
big
demon
in
desperate
need
of
a
stairmaster
i
say
we
take
'em
all
hard
and
fast
and
now
we
need
a
little
more
firepower
than

we
should
head
back
to
the
library
well
i
guess
jacuzzi
boy

going
anywhere

and
turns
the
blade
over
in
her
hand
smiling
i'm
gettin'
it
faith
smiles
too
seeing
that
buffy
is
finally
coming
around
to
her
way
of
thinking
she
turns
around
and
sees
a
compound
hunting
bow
under
the
glass
of
another
display
case
and
kicks
it
in
buffy
just
gives
her
a
brief
glance
faith
pulls
the
bow
out
and
looks
it
over
then
smiles
at
her
partner
in
slayage
but
before
they
can
get
any
further
they
are
surprised
by
a
gunshot
they
spin
around
to
see
they've
been
caught
by
two
police
officers
they
both
have
their
service
revolvers
aimed
at
them
drop
the
weapons
and

the
police
officer
takes
a
step
closer
eyeing
the
two
girls

the
weapons
or
i
fire
buffy
slowly
reaches
her
hand
out
and
sets
the
dagger
on
a
counter
the
officer
is
satisfied
and
turns
his
attention
to
faith
she
gives
in
but
isn't
as
gentle
with
the
hunting
bow
as
buffy
was
with
the
knife
simply
extending
her
arm
and
tossing
it
aside
the
two
officers
visibly
relax
a
bit
but
keep
their
guns
up
and
ready
now
spread
'em
faith
haughtily
you
wish
buffy's
eyes
go
wide
with
concern
for
what
faith
might
do
the
officers
tense
up
again
hands
in
the
air
where
i
can
see
'em
slow
faith
smiles
at
him
but
does
as
she's
told
and
raises
her
arms
over
her
head
buffy
raises
hers
as
well
but
just
level
to
her
shoulders
good

to
his
partner
now
cuff
'em
his
partner
holsters
his
gun
and
reaches
into
his
belt
for
his

checks
out
the
one
still
holding
the
gun

funny
faith
quietly
to
buffy
you

she
slouches
down
in
the
seat
buffy
realizes
what
she
intends
and
isn't
at
all
sure
it's
a
good
idea
faith
impatiently
we
can't
save
the
world

buffy
sees
the
truth
in

quietly
one

in
the
backs
of
their
heads
the
driver
loses
control
of
the
car
and
it
swerves
screechingly
to
the
left
and
smashes
into
a
parked
car
the
damage
isn't
terribly
serious
but
the
police
car's
radiator
has
burst
and
the
steam
rises
thickly
obscuring
the
view
both
officers
are
unconscious
buffy
climbs
out
of
the
front
passengerside
door
a
moment
later

comes
out

lifts
the
ladle
and
pours
the
water
over
balthazar

focus
onto
the
new
leader
of
the
eliminati
vincent
made
a
noble
effort
man
to
man
as
befits
a
true
warrior
balthazar
wheezes
he
had
courage
he
had
honor
and
i
have
jack
to
show
for
it
balthazar
calms
a
bit
it's
been
a
hundred
years
since
my
enemy
crippled
me
now
ultimate
power
is
within
his
grasp
and
i
shall
not
let
it
be
forget
about
honor
forget
about
everything
but
getting
my
amulet
bring
the
watchers
to
me
find
the
slayers
and
kill
them
kill
everything
that
gets
in
your
way
gooooo
gooooo
cut
to
buffy's
house
mmm
you
like
it
cut
to
buffy's
room
she
and
willow
are
sitting
on
her
bed
buffy
is
sniffing
a
small
black
felt
pouch
that
willow
gave
to
her
it
smells
good
what
is
it
willow
smiling
proudly
just
a
little
something
we
witches
like
to
call
a
protection
spell
good
deal
protection
buffy
sniffs
i'm
surprised
though
'cause
usually
spell
stuff's
more
stinky
yeah
that's
why
i
added
lavender
give
me
time
and
i
may
be
the
first
wicca
to
do
all
my
conjuring
in
pine
fresh
scent
so
what's
the
plan
buffy
gives
her
an
inquiring
look
for
tonight's
slayage
we're
going
aren't
we
buffy
wanting
to
avoid
the
subject
yeah
willow
knowing
there's
more
great
buffy
realizes
she
can't
hide
it
but
there's
a
'but'
and
that's
'but
you
shouldn't
come
tonight'
is
that
cool
willow
slightly
hurt
well
sure
makes
sense
you
know
you'll
be
facing
big
hairy
danger
buffy
tries
to
justify
it
uh
bbiggest
and
very
hairy
willow
fishes
for
more
information
you'll
be
risking
your
life
right
and
why
risk
yours
willow
glances
down
then
back
up
because
i'm
your
friend
i
know
will
and
that's
exactly
why
i
don't
want
you
going
it's
it's
too
dangerous
willow
protests
but
ii've
done
this
sort
of
thing
before
like
a
million
times
and
i
can
totally
handle
myself
besides
willow
holds
up
her
own
felt
pouch
minty
fresh
protection
so
there's
a
knock
at
the
door
faith
opens
it
and
comes
in
ready
time
to
motor
hey
willow
willow
unenthused
hi
willow
faces
buffy
uh
faith
paces
back
toward
the
door
buffy
stands
up
apologetic
i
really
should
but
we'll
hang
out
later
right
willow
trying
to
hide
how
hurt
she
is
yeah
you
you
go
ahead
i'll
just
get
my
stuff
buffy
wants
to
say
something
but
changes
her
mind
and
just
looks
at
her
friend
giving
her
felt
pouch
a
squeeze
and
follows
faith
out
of
the
room
willow
watches
her
go
then
looks
down
at
her
own
pouch
stupid
she
throws
the
pouch
down
on
the
bed
cut
to
an
alley
near
the
packing
warehouse
buffy
and
faith
come
walking
around
a
corner
faith
has
the
compound
hunting
bow
with
her
and
gets
an
arrow
ready
you're
quiet
tonight
i
just
wanna
get
this
done
yeah
faith
smiling
i'm
dying
to
test
out
the
longbow
i
think
it
might
be
my
new
thing
i
can't
believe
you
went
back
for
that
stuff
hey
how
do
you
feel
about
getting
some
ribs
you
know
after
we're
done
they
are
surprised
by
an
eliminatus
doing
a
front
tuck
from
above
and
landing
in
their
way
cut
to
giles'
office
wesley
checks
out
some
of
the
pictures
on
the
wall
while
giles
sits
at
his
desk
fidgeting
with
his
glasses
i
didn't
say
you
had
emotional
problems
wesley
turns
to
giles
i
said
you
had
an
emotional
problem
wesley
condescendingly
it's
quite
different
giles
enunciating
clearly
my
'attachment'
to
the
slayer
is
not
a
problem
in
point
of
fact
it's
been
a
very
wesley
interrupts
the
way
you've
handled
this
assignment
is
something
of
an
embarrassment
to
the
council
giles
miffed
if
you
want
to
criticize
my
methods
fine
but
you
can
keep
your
snide
remarks
to
yourself
and
while
you're
at
it
don't
criticize
my
methods
giles
puts
on
his
glasses
the
fact
is
you're
no
longer
qualified
to
act
as
watcher
wesley
paces
behind
giles
condescendingly
it's
not
your
fault
you've
done
well
it's
simply
time
for
somebody
else
to
take
the
field
wesley
turns
around
giles
looks
at
him
then
past
him
through
the
window
to
the
main
area
now's
a
good
time
to
start
wesley
turns
to
look
as
well
and
there
they
see
four
eliminati
come
to
take
them
to
balthazar
cut
to
the
alley
the
vampire
roars
and
comes
at
buffy
she
sidesteps
him
grabs
him
and
shoves
him
into
the
back
of
a
truck
he
comes
at
her
again
and
does
a
front
snap
kick
at
buffy
which
she
blocks
she
returns
with
a
roundhouse
kick
to
his
gut
knocking
him
to
the
pavement
buffy
jumps
on
him
and
they
begin
to
struggle
another
vampire
joins
in
as
faith
struggles
with
her
bow
but
they
are
in
too
close
of
quarters
for
her
to
use
it
against
him
faith
to
herself
screw
it
she
drops
the
bow
but
holds
on
to
the
arrow
she
ducks
a
roundhouse
kick
from
the
demon
and
the
momentum
of
the
kick
without
a
hit
makes
him
keep
spinning
before
he
lands
faith
does
a
sidekick
to
his
side
and
he
staggers
into
the
side
of
a
truck
faith
comes
at
him
with
her
arrow
and
plunges
it
home
as
he
turns
around
to
attack
again
he
bursts
into
ashes
buffy
gets
up
holding
her
stake
having
just
dusted
hers
as
well
i
think
we've
got
more
comin'
they
start
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
packing
warehouse
we're
never
gonna
make
it
to
the
warehouse
if
they
keep
coming
one
at
a
time
we
got
a
shot
suddenly
another
eliminatus
lands
in
front
of
them
and
thrusts
at
faith
with
his
short
sword
she
reacts
instantly
catching
his
arm
and
shoving
him
into
a
crate
then
pulling
him
off
and
swinging
him
backward
onto
a
pile
of
several
chords
of
wood
buffy
steps
right
in
and
stakes
him
he
crumbles
to
ash
the
two
slayers
continue
along
the
alley
at
a
brisk
pace
at
the
end
of
the
building
an
arm
reaches
out
and
grabs
buffy
by
the
shoulder
instantly
she
grabs
the
man
and
throws
him
against
a
dumpster
faith
jumps
right
in
to
stake
him
he
slumps
down
to
the
ground
hurt
by
the
impact
against
the
heavy
steel
container
it's
allan
but
faith
is
too
caught
up
in
things
and
doesn't
realize
he's
human
faith
no
faith
swings
down
with
her
stake
and
plunges
it
into
allan's
heart
then
pulls
it
out
allan
grabs
his
chest
in
pain
and
surprise
blood
pours
out
freely
pumped
out
by
his
now
punctured
beating
heart
faith
backs
away
as
buffy
quickly
gets
down
beside
him
to
try
to
help
him
allan
pulls
his
hands
away
and
looks
down
at
them
covered
in
his
own
blood
shaking
hard
as
he
goes
into
shock
buffy
looks
at
the
wound
and
sees
its
severity

looks
up
at
buffy

to
the
wound

the
allan
begins
to
convulse
his
eyes
go
wide
with
the
fear
of
death
as
blood
begins
to
trickle
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
he
tries
to
say
something
but
can't
get
the
words
out
buffy
can
only
watch
in
despair
unable
to
help
allan
looks
down
at
his
chest
one
last
time
then
reaches
up
to
buffy
but
his
arm
never
makes
it
it
falls
to
his
side
and
his
body
relaxes
against
the
dumpster
finally
dead
his
eyes
remain
wide
open
staring
up
into
nothing
buffy
stares
back
at
him
in
open
mouthed
horror

they
run
from
the

the
camera
cuts
to
allan's
face
still
blankly
staring
into

and
pans
down
to
his
bloodsoaked
shirt
and
jacket
cut
to
the
slayers
running
down
an
alley

climbs
up
on
some
crates
and
jumps
over

wall
buffy
decides
to
continue
down
the
alley
to
a
fence
and
climbs
over
it
instead
cut
into
another
alley
buffy
waits
for
a
car
to
pass
on
the
street
and
walks
into
the
alley
there
she
is
surprised
by

coming
out
of
the
shadows

in
the
distance
a
police
siren
can
be
heard
getting
closer
then
further
away
faith
kneels
down
beside
allan
and
reaches
out
for
the
wound
she
touches
it
and
immediately
yanks
her
hand
back
she
looks
at
him
her
expression
full
of
guilt
and
horror
at
making
the
worst
mistake
she
possibly
could
killing
a
human
cut
to
the
packing
warehouse
wesley
and
giles

does
a
full
spinning
wheel
kick
to
his

quickly
regains
his
balance

sees
what's
happening
and
looks
for

way
to
help

spies
an
electrical
cable
hanging
down
from
a
lamp
directly
above
balthazar
she
grabs
it
and
yanks
hard
and
the
lamp
falls
from

with
sparks
flying
right
into
the
pool

immediately
lets

rushes
over
to
help
angel
he's
shaken

fine

takes
a
sudden
breath

lets
out
his
last
breath
and
dies
