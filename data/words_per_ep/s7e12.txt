walking
through
the

nervously
holding
stakes
being
as
quiet
as
they
can
be
something
behind
them
steps
on
a
branch
and
makes
a
cracking
sound
and
the
girls
turn
to
look
it's
spike—in
vampire
visage
he
punches
rona
to
the
ground
vi
tries
to
stake
him
but
spike
catches
her
hand
and
grabs
her
and
twists
her
arm
behind
her
back
he
puts
his
arm
around
her
throat
growls
and
goes
to
bite
her
neck
vi
screams
spike
stops
before
biting
her
looks
up
and
lets
his
vamp
face
fade
away
vi
squeaks
with
fright
still
holding
her
he
looks
up
and
talks
to
people
in
front
of
him
ok
these
two
are
dead
why
rona
stands
dusts
herself
off
to
spike
'cause
the
black
chick
always
gets
it
first
vi
to
spike
ow
what
was
that
rona
i'm
dead
because
he's
a
vampire
i
don't
have
slayer
strength
slayer
speed—iit
wasn't
a
fair
fight
spike
still
holding
his
arm
to
her
neck
vi
do
you
think
i
care
about
a
fair
fight
vi
tentatively
no
no
sir
you
don't

valuable
lesson
of
some
sort
vi
spike
twists
her
arm
behind
her
back
ow
ok
spike
buffy
he
lets
vi
go
she
walks
up
to
molly
and
kennedy
who
are
standing
near
buffy
you're
right
you
don't
have
slayer
strength
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
you're
not
strong
you
have
inherent
abilities
that
others
do
not
have
molly
taking
notes
on
a
pad
not
like
you
do
no
not
yet
but
it's
there
you
have
the
potential
you
have
strength
speed
instinct
you
just
have
to
learn
to
trust
yourself
rona
what
did
your
instincts
tell
you
to
do
just
then
rona
halfheartedly
block
his
attack
keep
him
off
balance
gain
the
advantage
no
they
didn't
rona
frankly
they
told
me
to
run
vi
vi
rubbing
her
wrist
they
told
me
to
run
they're
still
sort
of
telling
me
to
run
don't
fight
on
his
terms
your
gut's
telling
them
to
run
run
ok
regain
the
higher
ground
make
the
fight
your
own
spike
what
did
your
instincts
tell
you
to
do
just
then
hunt

raises
his
eyebrows
and
smiles
a
little
full
speed
buffy
to
slayersintraining
he
needs
to
kill
to
live
that
tells
you
everything
you
need
to
know
spike
growls
and
lunges
at
buffy
she
ducks
and
he
ends
up
lunging
facefirst
into
a
headstone
he
falls
to
the
ground
lying
flat
on
his
back
and
buffy
straddles
him
holding
one
hand
to
his
throat
and
pointing
a
stake
above
his
heart
with
the
other
buffy
to
slayersintraining

day
buffy
carrying
a
battleaxe
is
pacing
back
and
forth
disapprovingly
in
front
of
the
girls
while
they
chatter
rona
and
kennedy
are
talking
and
molly
and
vi
are
talking
dawn's
sitting
on
the
stairs
watching
them
through
the
stair
rail
no
way
one
armed
pushups
are
bull
i
can
do
'em
i
can
do
the
kinda
way
you
clap
between
i'm
more
of
a
chin
up
kinda
girl
i
can
do
chinups
'til
the
cows
come
home
you're
saying
demon
and
i
don't
mean
to
oh
bananas
imagine
yourself
covered
in
human
viscera
vi
molly
and
vi
giggle
and
squeal
as
they
continue
talking
buffy
stops
pacing
and
hurls
the
battleaxe
at
the
bull'seye
target
hung
on
the
wall
the
axe
point
lands
in
the
center
a
perfect
bull'seye
everyone
stops
talking
and
looks
at
her
a
little
frightened
she
glares
at
them
sternly
you're
all
gonna
die
but
you
knew
that
already
buffy
paces
in
front
of
them
'cause
that's
the
cool
reward
for
being
human
big
dessert
at
the
end
of
the
meal
don't
kid
yourselves
you
guys
this
whole
thing
is
all
about
death
buffy
stands
still
you
think
you're
different
'cause
you
might
be
the
next
slayer
death
is
what
a
slayer
breathes
what
a
slayer
dreams
about
when
she
sleeps
death
is
what
a
slayer
lives
my
death
could
make
you
the
next
slayer
buffy
walks
back
to
retrieve
her
axe
from
the
target
oh
goody
rapt
attention
i
love
that
so
much
buffy
pulls
out
the
axe
now
where
was
i
ah
buffy
sets
down
the
axe
walks
back
to
the
front
if
we
go
with
what
anya's
resources
are
telling
us
then
the
first
is
in
remission
for
a
while
which
we
think
means
advantage
us
well
what
does
that
mean
about
the
first
buffy
crosses
her
arms
as
best
we
can
tell
he—or
precisely
it—was
putting
a
lot
of
stock
in
that
ubervamp
thing
the
chaka
khan
dawn
from
the
stairs
turokhan
buffy
doesn't
acknowledge
dawn
pacing
so
when
i
kicked
its
ass
the
whole
firsty
circus
decided
to
back
off
for
a
while
good
news
means
we
probably
don't
have
to
worry
about
it
pulling
spike's
strings
for
a
while
buffy
stands
still
here's
the
halfempty
time
away
means
time
to
regroup
and
part
of
that
regrouping
is
coming
back
stronger
than
ever
the
odds
are
against
us
time
is
against
us
and
some
of
us
will
die
in
this
battle
decide
now
that
it's
not
going
to
be
you
buffy
walks
closer
to
the
girls
i
know
you're
all
tired
far
away
from
home
anxious
but
you're
all
special
most
people
in
this
world
have
no
idea
why
they're
here
or
what
they
want
to
do
you
do
you
have
a
mission
a
reason
for
being
here
you're
not
here
by
chance
you're
here
because
you
are
the
chosen
ones
buffy

um
buffy
flutters

i
guess
sure
in
a
charming
endearing
loveable
yeah
i
feel
like
people
think
i'm
weird
and
so
they
pick
on
me
but
i
might
be—weird
buffy
chuckles
amanda
why
do
you
think
that
you're
weird
one
of
the
boys
who
picks
on
me
i
kind
of—see
if
a
guy
picks
on
you
is
it
weird
to
think
he's
cute
buffy

uncomfortably
leans
back
in
her

oh
buffy

it's
just
the
last
few
times
i've
seen
him
i've
wanted
to
you
know
pick
on
himextra
more
buffy
stifles
a

uhhuh
the
thing
is
i
can't
tell
my
mom
says
when
a
guy
teases
you
it
means
he
likes
you
buffy
nods
sometimes
that's
true
is
it
weird
we're
mean
to
each
other
and
we
like
each
other
well
it
depends
sometimes
that's
how
people
relate
being
mean
to
each
other
even
mortal
enemies—
buffy
increasingly
emphatic
then
with
the—
and
that
leads
to
no
good
absolutely
no
good
and
much
confusion
aand
then
it's
over
absolutely
seriously
definitely
over
and
that's
confusing
too
the
over
part
which
it
is
over
buffy
catches
herself
calms
a
bit
so
maybe
amanda
looks
somewhat
confused

glamazon
in

class
what's
her
name
oh
my
lab
partner

totally
fainted
right

pig
dissection

i
just
don't
think
she's
cut

glowing
aura
cool
i've
enchanted

map
on

the
aura
of
the
new
skin
of
snake
and
chrysalis
too
to
indicate
the
fresh
reborn
tumbleweed
and
rosebush
thorn
an
egg
that
means
the
life
to
come
take
this
oh
spirit
and
my
spell
is
done
as
willow
finishes
the
spell
recitation
an
orange
haze
emanates
from
the
fireplace
everyone
in
the
room
wrinkles
up
their
noses
and
starts
coughing
oh
good
god
what
is
that
smell
anya
covering
her
nose
with
her
hand
i'm
fairly
sure
that's
the
smell
of
a
hardboiled
egg
being
thrown
into
a
fire
uhhuh
willow
covering
her
mouth
and
nose
with
her
hand
the
smell
will
lead
us
to
the
potential
or
some
poor
soul
who
ate
too
many
chimichangas
she'll
also
be
lit
with
a
brilliant
aura
the
orange
haze
from
the
fire
has
gathered
in
the
center
of
the
room
making
a
mass
of
glowing
light
willow
anya
dawn
and
xander
are
standing
in
a
circle
almost
and
the
light
is
moving
around
in
the
middle
of
their
circle
is
it
supposed
to
be
shimmying
all
over
like
that
i
don't
know
i
don't
think
so
so
you
messed
up
the
spell
again
at
least
it
smells
you
know
otherworldly
anya
willow
looks
at
her
hurt
anya
realizes
this
and
changes
the
subject
pointing
to
the
light
oh
look
pretty
i
suck
i'm
sorry
you
guys
i—
maybe
we
could
figure
something
out
on
the
computer
good
call
i'm
gonna
open
the
door
and
let
this
place
air
out
dawn
waves
at
the
air
in
front
of
her
as
she
walks
to
the
front
door
xander
walks
up
to
willow
puts
his
arm
around
her
don't
worry
will
it's
really
no
big
i
just—i
was
sure
that
it
was
gonna
work
suddenly
the
mass
of
light
congeals
and
forms
into
a
solid
beam
and
heads
straight
for
dawn
dawn
the
light
hits
dawn
with
such
a
force
that
it
picks
her
up
and
pins
her
to
the
door
the
light
goes
straight
into
her
then
she
drops
to
the
ground
her
chest
still
glowing
orange
somewhat
disoriented
dawn
looks
at
willow
xander
and
anya
with
wide
eyes
willow
staring
at
dawn
i
think
it
worked
fade
to
black
act
ii

cut
to
26
int
living
room
at
buffy's
house
night
resume
dawn
collapses
at
the
door
xander
goes
to
her
side
dawn
willow
willow
and
anya
step
forward
dawn
are
you
ok
dawn
stands
walks
into
the
living
room
the
others
follow
maybe
yyou
did
it
wrong
was
it
aambiguous
in
any
way
did
you
maybe
say
potential
sailors
'cause
ii
do
like
the
water
i
did
it
right
xander
staring
at
her
wow
she—you're
a
potential
you
could
be
the
next
slayer
dawn
eyes
growing
wider
whoa
dawn
goes
to
sit
on
the
sofa
anya
kneels
in
front
of
her
wow
it's
like
one
second
you
were
this
klutzy
teenager
with
fake
memories
and
a
history
of
kleptomania
and
then—then
suddenly
you're
a
hero
a
hero
with
a
much
abbreviated
lifespan
this
is
huge
we
have
to
think
about
this
ii
can't
think
about
this
dawn
stands
paces
it
doesn't
fit
in
my
head
a
slayer
makes
sense
i
guess
remember
that
thing
about
they
share
the
same
blood
or
whatever
anya
shrugs
yeah
i
never
got
that
she
has
to
die
dawn
sits
on
a
chair
i
mean
if
i
was
ever
the
slayer
it
would
mean
she
died
well
it's
a
lot
like
being
the
pope
in
that
way
except
you
don't
have
to
be
some
old
catholic
i've
got
to
call
buffy
she's
gonna
be
so
excited
willow
goes
to
the
phone
xander
blocks
her
no
we
can't
she
didn't
bring
a
cell
phone
well
sure
'cause
all
the
important
people
are
with
her
xander
points
to
dawn
you
are
important
now
dawn
stands
whwhawhat
happens
now
well
you
could
start
by
maybe
sitting
still
for
a
sec
dawn
paces
ii
cant
ii
need
to
know
what
happens
to
my
life
well
i
guess
buffy
trains
you
right
i
train
with
the
potentials—other
potentials
learn
to
do
the
stuff
they're
learning
right
we
also
have
to
protect
you
from
the
uh
eyeless
guys
the
ones
with
the
sharp
sharp
knives
bringers
it's
ok
we'll
protect
you
dawn
worried
what
if
they
saw
the
spell
saw
the
spell
dawn
they
can't
see
flashcards
big
ones
dawn
getting
upset
we
did
a
big
orange
powerful
spell
what
if
they
sensed
it
what
if
they're
on
their
way
andrew
enters
the
room
are
we
gonna
replace
the
microwave
'cause
i
was
thinking
some
orville
redenbacher
with
fresh
butter
flavor—
what's
going
on
dawn's
gonna
be
a
slayer
holy
crap
andrew
xander
gives
him
a
look
excuse
me
plucked
from
an
ordinary
life
handed
a
destiny—
xander
points
at
andrew
say
skywalker
and
i
smack
ya
does
buffy
know
she
didn't
take
her
phone
incommunicado
well
we'll
tell
her
soon
as
she
gets
back
let's
not
what
dawn
she
has
to
know
ii
know
just
not
right
away
guys
when
mom
appeared
to
me
she
said—
dawnie
no
please
she
said
something
about
buffy
and
i'm
thinking
i'm
just
not
so
sure
buffy
will
be
happy
for
me
of
course
she
will
will
she
i
mean
i'm
not
even
sure
i'm
happy
for
me
everything's
different
for
me
now
that's
because
you're
a
part
of
something
larger
like
being
swallowed
by
something
larger
dawn
stands
thisthis
is
too
much
for
my
head
again
dawn
runs
upstairs
i
can't
i—i
need
to
be—
nice
job
with
the
getting
swallowed
analogy
well
it
is
a
mixed
bag
you
know
if
she
gets
to
be
the
slayer
then
her
life
is
short
and
brutal
and
if
she
doesn't
then
it
smells
of
unfulfilled
potential
my
swallowed
analogy
looks
pretty
sweet
right
now
doesn't
it
it's
not
like
that
it's
like
she's
part
of
this
huge
power
i
know
what
that
feels
like
it
feels
wonderful
yes
willow
so
captured
it
it's
like—well
it's
almost
like
this
metaphor
for
womanhood
isn't
it
the
sort
of
flowering
that
happens
when
a
girl
realizes
that
she's
part
of
a
fertile
heritage
stretching
back
to
eve
and—
xander
covers
his
face
with
his
hands
then
gestures
to
andrew
i'll
pay
you
to
talk
about
star
wars
again
this
isn't
about
womany
power
this
is
about
the
fact
that
dawn
just
might
have
bought
herself
an
early
death
we
don't
know
that
right
all
we
know
is
that
everything
just
changed
26a
int
dawn's
room
at
buffy's
house
night
from
the
door
to
her
room
dawn
listens
to
the
others
argue
downstairs
someone
should
go
find
buffy
i
still
think
she
needs
to
know
hey
will
what
if
she
doesn't
like
it
are
you
worried
about
what
dawn
said
about
the
ghost
xander
we
don't
even
know
if
that
really
was
joyce
and
we
don't
know
what
she
meant
about
buffy
i'm
not
talking
about
that
i
mean
what
do
you
think
buffy's
going
to
do
with
this
information
jump
up
and
down
teach
dawn
the
secret
handshake
she
know
what
this
means
short
brutal
life
sharp
sharp
knives
i
covered
this
right
you
think
buffy
really
wants
that
for
dawn
and
besides
dawn
doesn't
want
us
telling
her
yet
26b
int
dawn's
room
at
buffy's
house
night
dawn
walks
to
her
mirror
and
stares
while
listening
to
the
others
talk
downstairs
dawn's
freaking
out
her
input—not
worth
that
much
right
now
she's
a
child
of
course
she
can't
handle
this
hey
something
out
there
says
she
can
handle
this
and
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
something
out
there
chose
her
i'm
chosen
sure
she
can
handle
it
is
that
why
she's
hiding
out
in
her
room
right
now
she's
just
getting
used
to
it
let
it
happen
she
doesn't
have
to
rush
he's
right
we
shouldn't
rush
her
rushing's
only
gonna
get
her
killed

28
ext
neighborhood
street
in
sunnydale
night
dawn's
walking
down
the
street
alone
arms
crossed
and
looking
at
the
ground
then
she
hears
someone
approaching
down
the
sidewalk
she
looks
up
it's
amanda
walking
toward
her
hey
hey
dawn
whatcha
doing
dawn
shrugs
uh
just
walking
you
um
yeah
just
walking
too
k
well
have
a
good
walk
i
guess
i'll
see
you
monday
morning
yeah
they
walk
past
each
other
still
going
in
opposite
directions
then
amanda
turns
to
dawn
you
all
right
sure
just
walking
you
know
dawn
looks
closely
at
amanda's
face
aare
you
all
right
dawn
points
to
her
own
forehead
you've
got
a
thing
amanda
amanda
touches
her
head
where
there's
a
bloody
gash
above
her
eye
she
laughs
nervously
i
guess
i—
i
had
a
bit
of
a—
it's
been
a
bizarre
night
what
happened
who
did
that
to
you
amanda
biting
her
nails
uh
nobodyexactly
i
don't
think
you'd
exactly
believe
me
try
me
ii
was
at
school
late
because
of
you
know
swing
choir
and
i
tore
my
sweater
you
know
the
striped
ones
we
wear
so
i
went
to
home
sciences
to
sew
it
up
uhhuh
and
by
the
time
i
was
finished
the
place
was
empty
so
it
was
all
echoy
and
lonely
and
then
there
was
this
guy—or
thing
and
it
was—it
scratched
me
and
i
kinda
dodged
it
and
it
kinda
hit
its
head
what
kind
of
thing
i
don't
know
it
was
messed
up
in
the
face
'round
here
abouts
amanda
runs
her
finger
between
her
brows
and
down
the
bridge
of
her
nose
and
when
it
scratched
at
you
did
it—was
it
scratching
with
its
teeth
is
it
real
was
it
really
a
vampire
i
bet
you
think
i'm
crazy
i—i
believe
you
well
cool
the
thing
is
after
it
hit
its
head
i
kinda
freaked
out
i
trapped
it
in
a
room
and
it's
still
there
and
now
i
don't
know
what
to
do
it's
ok
this
is
totally
dealable
don't
worry
well
i
was
thinking
of
getting
your
sister
you
know
something
about
my
sister
well
i've
heard
people
talking
a
lot
of
'em
think
she's
some
kind
of
highfunctioning
schizophrenic
but
i
also
heard
that
maybe—like
maybe
she
could
help
with
this
kind
of
thing
do
you
think
we
should
go
get
her
she's
out
i'll
take
this
one
cut
to
29
int
classroom
at
sunnydale
high
night
dawn
and
amanda
climb
into
the
school
through
classroom
window
dawn
pulls
a
muscle
as
she
climbs
over
the
window
ledge
dawn
yelps
rubs
her
back
whew
i
think
i
strained
something
maybe
something
i'll
need
later
in
life
uh…
come
on
the
vampire's
upstairs
are
you
spooked
out
no
i'm
all
right
ii
can
do
this
it's
mostly
instinct
i
think
as
they
walk
out
the
window
slams
shut
scaring
dawn
she
jumps
and
squeals
but
when
she
turns
to
see
what
it
was
she
is
able
to
collect
her
cool
dawn
and
amanda
walk
out
into
the
hall
so
if
he
scratched
me
with
a
tooth
am
i—i'm
not
gonna
turn
into
one
am
i
dawn
shakes
her
head
uh
only
if
he
slashed
open
one
of
his
own
veins
and
led
you
to
drink
deep
of
his
blood
nope
good
you're
lucky
he
didn't
hurt
you
way
more
than
that
right
he
can
do
that
amanda
stops
walking
turns
to
dawn
so
i
was
thinking
we
don't
have
to
kill
the
vampire
do
we
what
just
suppose
he
got
out
and
was
maybe
like
encouraged
toward
the
gym
while
the
marching
band
was
playing
because
the
way
they
look
down
on
the
swing
choir
it
might
be
you
know
funny
amanda
dawn
stares
in
disbelief
amanda
chuckles
i'm
just
saying
cut
to
30
int
hallway
at
sunnydale
high
night
dawn
and
amanda
walk
up
to
a
classroom
door
and
they
both
stop
and
stand
in
front
of
it
well
he
didn't
break
down
the
door
anyway
yeah
can
they
do
that
they're
very
strong
and
although
they
feel
pain
they
don't
hold
back
because
of
it
guess
you're
some
kind
of
monster
expert
too
let's
just
say
it
runs
in
the
family
dawn
takes
a
deep
breath
and
then
tries

vi—vi
actually
yells
we're
just
four
helpless

kennedy
rolls
her
eyes
playfully
at

we
knew
what
we
were
doing
for

molly

pulled
his
legs
out
i
hurt
his
arm
vi
nods
proudly
yep
and
an
arm
can
be
as
lethal
as
a
mouth
molly
to
kennedy
when
you
staked
him
seriously
the
rush
was
like—
kennedy
to
amanda
so
you
took

to
dawn
from
the
kitchen
followed
by
xander
hey
buffy
dawn
turns
to
face
her
puts
on
a
happy
face
you
ok
dawn
nods
yeah
i
was
thinking
of
hitting
the
books
do
some
research
on
the
first
it's
in
retreat
mode
right
now
but
you're
still
gonna
need
to
know
how
to
fight
it
buffy
nods
great
sounds
good
buffy
to
the
slayersintraining
hey
you
guys
wanna
head
downstairs
get
our
newest
arrival
up
to
speed
the
girls
all
stand
and
follow
buffy
out
of
the
room
as
each
slayerintraining
passes
by
dawn
they
don't
look
at
her
don't
acknowledge
her
at
all
until
amanda
walks
by
amanda
pauses
for
a
second
and
looks
at
dawn
smiles
and
then
continues
to
follow
the
other
girls
after
the
girls
have
gone
dawn
sits
down
at
the
desk
opens
a
book
and
starts
to
read
it
then
she
notices
that
xander
hasn't
left
the
room
but
is
standing
behind
her
watching
her
dawn
looking
over
her
shoulder
to
xander
what's
up
xander
walks
into
the
room
aw
i'm
just
thinking
about
the
girls
it's
a
harsh
gig
being
a
potential
just
being
picked
out
of
a
crowd
danger
destiny
xander
grins
plus
if
you
act
now
death
they
can
handle
it
yeah
xander
sits
in
a
chair
in
front
of
the
desk
they're
special
no
doubt
the
amazing
thing
is
not
one
of
them
will
ever
know
not
even
buffy
know
what
how
much
harder
it
is
for
the
rest
of
us
no
way
they've
got—
seven
years
dawn
working
with
the
slayer
seeing
my
friends
get
more
and
more
powerful
a
witch
a
demon
hell
i
could
fit
oz
in
my
shaving
kit
but
come
a
full
moon
he
had
a
wolfy
mojo
not
to
be
messed
with
powerful
all
of
them
and
i'm
the
guy
who
fixes
the
windows
well
you
had
that
sexy
army
training
for
a
while
and—and
the
windows
really
did
need
fixing
i
saw
what
you
did
last
night
yeah
i—
dawn
shakes
her
head
embarrassed
i
guess
i
kinda
lost
my
head
when
i
thought
i
was
the
slayer
you
thought
you
were
all
special
miss
sunnydale
2003
and
the
minute
you
found
out
you
weren't
you
handed
the
crown
to
amanda
without
a
moment's
pause
you
gave
her
your
power
dawn
shrugs
the
power
wasn't
mine
they'll
never
know
how
tough
it
is
dawnie
to
be
the
one
who
isn't
chosen
to
live
so
near
to
the
spotlight
and
never
step
in
it
but
i
know
i
see
more
than
anybody
realizes
because
nobody's
watching
me
i
saw
you
last
night
i
see
you
working
here
today
you're
not
special
you're
extraordinary
xander
stands
kisses
her
forehead
stands
to
walk
out
of
the
room
dawn
tears
welling
in
her
eyes
calls
after
him
maybe
that's
your
power
xander
pauses
at
the
door
what
seeing
knowing
maybe
it
is
maybe
i
should
get
a
cape
cape
is
good
yeah
xander
leaves
the
room
dawn
gathers
herself
together
never
letting
a
tear
drop
she
breathes
deeply
then
goes
back
to
work
on
the
books
at
her
desk
closing
credits
