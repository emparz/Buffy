pouring
a
bowl
of

looks
over
at
buffy
shot
of
buffy's

times
a
day
another
shot
of
the
running

xander
and
another
guy
emerge
from
the

at
them
and
a
big
sunnydale
round
of
applause
for

amazing
plumber
extraordinaire

everything
looking
down

copper
repipe
job
willow
comes
over
and
tito
gives

a
piece
of

copper
repipe
that
sounds
potentially
pricey

on
the

tito
pats
xander
on
the
shoulder
and
exits

your
feet
after
lying
flat
on
my
back
yeah

but
there's
some
money
stuff
we're
gonna
have
to
talk
to
you
about
cut
to
the
living
room
buffy
sits
on
the
sofa
looking
at
piles
of
paper
all
over
the
coffeetable
she
has
some
more
paper
in
her
hands
she
gives
a
disbelieving
laugh
and
throws
the
papers
down
okay
so
you're
telling
me
i'm
broke
we
see
tara
and
willow
sitting
across
from
buffy
with
dawn
in
the
background
not
yet
but

money's
definitely
becoming
an
issue
as
in
your
being
almost
out
of
it
we
see
xander
sitting
beside
willow
and
tara
anya
sits
at
a
desk
off
to
the
side
writing
something
but
i
haven't
spent
any
money
i
was
all
dead
and
frugal
ii
know
this
comes
as
a
bit
of
a
shock
after
a
bit
of
a
shock
but
it
took
us
by
surprise
too
your
mother
prepared
everything
really
well
she
had
insurance

tara
nervously
life
insurance
which
should
have
left
you
covered
but
hospital
bills
pretty
much
sucked
up
all
the
money
which
you're
still
hemorrhaging
by
the
way
buffy
confused
how
am
i
doing
that
no
not
you
the
house
uh
see
this
house
just
sitting
here
doing
nothing
um
by
itself
costs
money
dawn
worried
so
what
do
we
do
easy
we
burn
the
house
to
the
ground
and
collect
the
insurance
buffy
dawn
continues
looking
worried
plus
fire
pretty
everyone
stares
at
her
you
guys
i'm
kidding
okay
it's
it's
bills
it's
money
it's
pieces
of
paper
sent
by
bureaucrats
that
we've
never
even
met
it's
not
like
it's
the
end
of
the
world
she
thinks
about
that
for
a
moment
which
is
too
bad
you
know
'cause
that
i'm
really
good
at
dawn
still
looks
worried
buffy
to
dawn
i'll
take
care
of
this
i
promise
i
just
don't
know
how
yet
anya
looks
like
she
really
wants
to
say
something
she
pauses
takes
a
deep
breath
speaks
too
loudly
i
know
how
everyone
looks
at
her
um
iiif
you
wanna
pay
every
bill
here
and
every
bill
coming
and
have
enough
to
start
a
nice
college
fund
for
dawn
anya
big
smile
start
charging
buffy
irritated
for
what
slaying
vampires
anya
xander
looks
embarrassed
well
you're
providing
a
valuable
service
to
the
whole
community
i
say
cash
in
awkward
pause
xander
still
looks
uncomfortable
anya
doesn't
pick
up
on
it
buffy
carefully
well
that's
an
idea
you
would
have
any
other
suggestions
anya
softly
well
i
mean
it's
it's
not
so
crazy
yes
it
is
you
can't
charge
innocent
people
for
saving
their
lives
spiderman
does
he
does
not
does
too
does
no
dawn
stops
herself
calms
down
a
little
xander
anya
looks
at
xander
he
continues
looking
uncomfortable
xander
reluctantly
action
is
his
reward
dawn
gives
anya
a
told
you
so
look
anya
looks
annoyed
stands
up
anya
angrily
why
don't
you
ever
take
my
side
she
exits
what
are
you
talking
about
taking
your
side
anya
i
am
your
side
xander
runs
out
after
anya
willow
watches
them
go
with
a
small
smile
then
turns
to
buffy
you're
throwin'
away
a
gold
mine
cut
to
the
street
anya
strides
angrily
down
the
sidewalk
xander
comes
down
the
steps
and
hurries
after
her
come
on
wait
up
anya
he
runs
in
front
of
her
what's
wrong
with
you
why
don't
you
ask
your
best
friend
spiderman
you
know
if
you're
not
going
to
support
me
i'm
supportive
i'm
totally
supportive
i'm
a
flying
buttress
of
support
no
you're
not
she
looks
down
xander
sighs
this
is
because
i
haven't
told
them
yet
about
the
engagement
isn't
it
anya
scoffs
no
maybe
yes
anya
whines
it's
painful
and
confusing
i
mean
first
you
you
give
me
this
beautiful
ring
anya
holds
up
the
box
with
the
ring
in
it
and
then
i
can't
even
wear
it
in
public
i
mean
do
you
know
how
depressing
that
is
anya
i
promise
your
waiting
days
are
almost
over
i
i
know
it's
frustrating
but
the
way
i
understand
this
marriage
thing
it's
kind
of
a
forever
deal
not
if
you
never
get
started
anya
softly
i
mean
don't
you
want
to
get
married
yes
so
then
why
won't
you
tell
them
xander
sighs
gestures
because
i'm
still
getting
used
to
the
miracle
of
a
steady
paycheck
and
getting
out
of
my
parents'
house
and
this
this
husband
thing
it's
a
big
step
or
a
lot
of
little
ones
and
and
i
love
you
so
much
i
just
want
every
step
to
be
just
right
anya
hopefully
really
he
nods
anya
walks
up
close
to
him
and
kisses
him
they
put
arms
around
each
other
and
continue
kissing
for
a
long
moment
suddenly
anya
pulls
away
anya
yells
hey
you
tricked
me
just
now
wwith
your
fancy
talk
and
and
lips
you
keep
doing
this
and
i
keep
forgetting
and
you
keep
stalling
she
turns
and
stalks
off
angrily
anya
anya
continues
walking
when
are
you
going
to
grow
up
xander
xander
stares
after
her
there's
a
first
time
for
everything
is
my
philosophy
cut
to
buffy
sitting
in
an
office
there
are
glass
windows
through
which
we
can
see
people
moving
around
buffy
wears
a
conservative
skirtsuit
and
her
hair
is
pulled
back
in
a
neat
bun
she
smiles
widely
the
next
series
of
sentences
are
intercut
together
in
separate
takes
this
is
my
first
big
loan
cut
collateral
no
problem
cut
no
problem
cut
no
problem
cut
i
love
that
tie
cut
i'm
a
problem
solver
cut
let's
crunch
those
numbers
the
final
cut
finds
her
staring
down
at
herself
looking
annoyed
buffy
mutters
stupid
skirt
she
turns
as
a
man
enters
the
office
buffy
puts
on
her
biggest
smile
stands
hello
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting
carl
savitsky
loan
officer
he
sits
behind
the
desk
across
from
buffy
she
sits
also
buffy
summers
loan
applierfor
he
smiles
but
doesn't
seem
amused
buffy
plunges
on
i
i
didn't
know
exactly
what
you
would
need
so
um
i
brought
everything
buffy
hands
him
a
thick
folder
i'm
very
responsible
in
that
way
he
begins
looking
through
the
papers
in
the
folder
okay
i
don't
think
i'll
need
this
or
these
old
report
cards
definitely
not
buffy
smiles
nervously
he
continues
looking
at
the
papers
putting
most
of
them
aside
so
about
my
getting
a
loan
yes
well
uh
it
looks
as
if
financially
uh
we
have
a
bit
of
a
tangle
i
know
and
i
figured
you
could
just
you
know
cut
through
that
tangle
with
scissors
you
know
where
the
loan
is
the
scissors
buffy
makes
scissors
motion
with
her
hand
mr
savitsky
still
not
amused
ms
summers
the
only
collateral
you
have
is
your
house
which
was
never
fully
leveraged
and
has
been
losing
equity
over
the
last
several
years
for
some
reason
sunnydale
property
values
have
never
been
competitive
and
refinancing's
out
of
the
question
buffy's
face
falls
as
she
realizes
the
news
is
bad
he
gives
her
a
little
sympathetic
smile
are
you
saying
you
won't
give
me
my
loan
well
the
problem
is
you
have
no
income
no
job
suddenly
the
body
of
another
man
crashes
through
the
glass
window
and
lands
on
the
desk
sounds
of
screaming
broken
glass
everywhere
buffy
jumps
up
looks
out
at
the
main
bank
area
people
are
running
around
screaming
a
large
demon
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
gives
a
loud
roar
buffy
to
herself
no
job
buffy
pouts
i
wish
blackout
act
ii

open
on
the
same
scene
the
demon
is
roaring
and
throwing
people
around
buffy
os
hey
the
demon
turns
around
to
find
buffy
behind
him
are
you
in
the
wrong
line
buffy
points
that's
for
deposits
buffy
points
that's
for
withdrawals
and
this
one
is
for
getting
kicked
in
the
face
she
goes
to
kick
the
demon
but
can't
move
her
legs
pan
down
and
we
see
that
her
long
tight
skirt
is
restricting
her
movements
buffy
worried
stupid
skirt
the
demon
hits
her
hard
she
goes
flying
back
through
the
glassless
window
and
lands
on
mr
savitsky's
desk
mr
savitsky
pokes
his
head
up
from
hiding
behind
the
desk
buffy
sees
a
pencilholder
on
the
desk
with
only
one
thing
left
in
it
may
i
mr
savitsky
nods
buffy
takes
out
the
letteropener
she
uses
it
to
cut
a
slit
in
her
skirt
freeing
her
legs
puts
the
letter
opener
back
and
gets
up
the
demon
comes
forward
and
buffy
kicks
him
back
she
blocks
a
couple
of
punches
kicks
him
again
he
surges
right
back
and
she
blocks
a
couple
more
punches
ducks
another
punch
punches
him
in
the
face
fight
noises
continue
as
we
see
a
closeup
of
someone's
hands
grabbing
the
money
out
of
the
teller
drawers
and
putting
it
in
a
bag
we
don't
see
the
person's
face
just
the
hands
cut
back
to
the
fight
buffy
raises
her
hands
to
swing
and
the
demon
grabs
her
lifts
her
up
onto
his
shoulder
she
kicks
and
hits
his
back
as
he
carries
her
suddenly
we
hear
a
gunshot
both
buffy
and
the
demon
look
over
to
a
bank
security
guard
standing
there
pointing
his
gun
at
them
he
looks
very
nervous
put
the
girl
down
the
demon
throws
buffy
at
the
guard
she
crashes
into
him
and
they
both
fall
to
the
ground
as
buffy
gets
up
to
a
sitting
position
we
see
a
couple
of
other
male
customers
attacking
the
demon
and
getting
quickly
beaten
up
buffy
picks
up
the
gun
buffy
to
guard
these
things
never
helpful
she
tosses
the
gun
away
in
the
background
the
demon
is
still
fighting
off
various
other
people
the
gun
hits
the
floor
and
goes
off
buffy
and
the
guard
duck
the
demon
runs
for
the
door
shoving
another
guy
into
buffy's
path
as
she
tries
to
pursue
him
by
the
time
she
gets
the
guy
out
of
her
way
the
demon
has
escaped
buffy
stares
after
him
in
frustration
then
she
gives
a
determined
frown
cut
to
mr
savitsky's
office
buffy
storms
in
puts
her
hands
on
the
desk
which
is
still
covered
with
broken
glass
buffy
panting
now
about
my
loan
mr
savitsky
slowly
raises
his
head
to
look
at
her
he's
still
hiding
behind
the
desk
i'm
not
saying
i'm
charging
you
for
saving
your
life
or
anything
but
let's
talk
rates
mr
savitsky
looks
at
her
cut
to
exterior
shot
of
the
magic
box
night
willow
os
he
still
turned
you
down
that's
crazy
cut
to
inside
buffy
is
punching
the
punching
bag
while
willow
sits
nearby
talking
i
mean
even
if
the
bank
did
get
robbed
which
you
battling
demons
couldn't
possibly
know
you
would
think
there
would
be
some
kind
of
reward
buffy
continues
hitting
the
bag
hard
and
fast
but
no
they're
like
oh
we're
not
gonna
give
you
money
unless
you
prove
you
don't
need
it
i
mean
what
kind
of
system
is
that
buffy
pauses
you're
asking
the
wrong
gal
she
resumes
punching
willow
surprised
hey
willow
gets
down
goes
over
to
her
buffy
you're
mad
buffy
stops
punching
you
noticed
buffy
shrugs
it'll
pass
buffy
resumes
punching
no
anger
is
a
big
powerful
emotion
you
should
feel
buffy
stops
punching
well
that's
good
then
buffy
stands
there
steadying
the
punching
bag
with
her
hands
she
shrugs
it's
gone
now
okay
uh
let
me
make
you
mad
again
uh
ready
um

willow
thinks
gets
an
idea
last
semester
i
slept
with
riley
buffy
gives
her
a
dubious
look
and
you
know
i
really
doubt
it
caught
me
big
fib
to
cover
up
the
sleazy
affair
i
had
with
angel
willow
smiles
proudly
buffy
frowning
will
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
pissing
you
off
yes
true
why
well
'cause
you
know
since
you've
been
back
you
haven't
exactly
been
big
with
the
whole
range
of
human
emotions
thing
buffy
blankly
what
do
you
mean
willow
fidgets
well
you
haven't
no
i
mean
it's
just
um

willow
buffy
still
looks
blank
willow
gives
up
you
know
this
is
really
my
problem
willow
backing
away
i'm
just
i'm
all
over
the
place
and
you
should
just
uh
forget
i
even
said
anything
cause
cause
willow
sits
back
down
well
'cause
you
know
banks
man
willow
nods
agreement
with
herself
looks
at
buffy
for
agreement
buffy
just
returns
to
punching
anya
os
don't
be
such
a
wiener
dog
cut
to
the
main
magic
shop
room
anya
and
xander
sit
at
a
table
with
books
open
in
front
of
them
look
at
them
anya
shot
of
tara
and
dawn
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
making
a
pile
of
books
researching
demons
for
the
billionth
time
they
could
use
a
peppy
boost
of
happy
news
xander
nods
nervously
you're
right
i'll
tell
them
he
stands
up
halfway
reconsiders
sits
back
down
with
a
glance
toward
the
back
as
soon
as
buffy
and
willow
come
in
anya
exasperated
chicken
would
you
stop
dare
you
anya
if
i
tell
them
we're
engaged
right
after
you
dared
me
to
wouldn't
you
always
wonder
if
that's
the
only
reason
i
did
it
anya
thinks
about
this
realizes
he's
right
oh
score
one
for
captain
logic
no
no
captain
logic
is
not
steering
this
tugboat
i
smell
captain
fear
at
the
wheel
anya
lowers
her
voice
as
tara
and
dawn
move
toward
them
god
i
hate
this
this
tone
in
my
voice
i
dislike
it
more
than
you
do
and
i'm
closer
to
it
tara
and
dawn
come
over
to
the
table
and
put
down
some
more
books
tara
sits
oh
come
on
tara
i
am
so
old
enough
to
do
research
do
you
really
think
i'm
not
mature
enough
i
think
you're
very
mature
for
your
age
but
you're
still
only
fifteen
right
fifteen
as
in
teenager
you
know
if
you
don't
let
me
look
at
the
pictures
i'm
gonna
learn
everything
i
know
about
demons
on
the
street
tara
sighs
hands
her
a
book
knock
yourself
out
thank
you
see
dawn
sits
no
biggie
i
can
totally
handle
it
she
opens
the
book
and
checks
out
the
first
page
that's
a
weird
place
for
a
horn
she
looks
again
slowly
closes
the
book
dawn
quietly
that's
not
a
horn
xander
quickly
you
know
i
still
don't
get
it
i
mean
what
kind
of
a
demon
would
rob
a
bank
the
kind
that
wants
money
what
do
you
even
call
that
this
she
holds
up
a
book
turned
to
a
picture
of
a
demon
i'm
guessing
on
how
you
say
it
it's
got
an
apostrophe
i
think
it's
mmmfashnik
like
mmm
cookies
or
maybe
muhfashnik
like
muh
xander
lamely
fashnik
buffy
and
willow
emerge
from
the
back
room
dawn
holds
up
the
book
toward
buffy
this
your
guy
buffy
to
dawn
you
do
research
now
want
a
cappuccino
and
a
pack
of
cigarettes
to
go
with
it
would
you
just
look
at
the
picture
doesn't
exactly
fit
the
profile
for
your
typical
bank
robber
maybe
they
turned
down
his
loan
application
buffy
smiles
at
willow
then
looks
at
dawn's
book
that's
him
big
bad
this
thing
was
strong
guys
no
weapons
that
i
could
see
but

buffy
notices
something
across
the
room
stares
that
way
as
her
mouth
finishes
the
sentence
on
its
own
still
real
dangerous
the
others
turn
to
see
what
she's
looking
at
reveal
giles
standing
by
the
door
holding
a
couple
of
suitcases
staring
at
buffy
buffy
stares
back
giles
puts
down
his
bags
comes
forward
buffy
walks
forward
until
they
are
facetoface
giles
smiling
oh
god
buffy
he
hugs
her
she
hugs
him
back
closes
her
eyes
you're
alive
you're
here
and
you're
still

giles
strained
remarkably
strong
huh
oh
buffy
lets
him
go
sorry
willow
told
me
but
i
didn't
really
let
myself
believe

i
take
a
little
getting
used
to
i'm
still
getting
used
to
me
it's
uh
you're

a
miracle
yes
but
then
i
always
thought
so
giles
puts
his
hand
on
buffy's
cheek
and
looks
at
her
fondly
the
others
watch
smiling
cut
to
the
street
night
the
m'fashnik
demon
walks
along
growling
softly
cut
to
the
workout
room
giles
and
buffy
stand
facing
each
other
a
little
awkward
so

giles
punches
the
punching
bag
lightly
i
can
start
how
was
england
buffy
sits
how
was
life
uh
i'm
not
really
sure
how
to
answer
that
um
well
i
arrived
home
i
uh
met
with
the
council
always
a
good
time
yes
otherwise
there's
uh
nothing
really
to
report
i
um
i
keep
a
flat
in
bath
i
i
uh
met
with
a
few
old
friends
almost
made
a
new
one
which
i
think
is
statistically
impossible
for
a
man
of
my
age
he
takes
off
his
jacket
tosses
it
onto
the
sofa
and
now
you're
back
yes
wow
giles
are
you
miserable
about
it
or
just
really
british
giles
smiles
takes
off
his
glasses
i
can't
lie
to
you
buffy
giles
sits
beside
her
um
leaving
sunnydale
was
uh
was
difficult
and
uh
coming
back
was
i'm
guessing
the
word
is
inconvenient
no
bewildering
buffy
looks
down
giles
puts
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
how
are
you
really
you
look
tired
me
nah
fine
giles
gives
her
a
look
and
she
drops
the
act
i
mean
yeah
you
know
sleeping's
hard
but
just
because
of
the
whole
waking
up
in
a
box
thing
so
maybe
waking
up's
the
problem
you
know
but
just
for
a
second
i
sleep
okay
great
even
except
you
know
for
the
dreams

she
trails
off
looks
away
again
you
seem
to
be
doing
remarkably
well
under
extreme
circumstances
i'm
proud
of
you
well
actually
it
wasn't
me
willow
brought
me
back
i
just
lay
there
youyou
know
i
meant

i
know
what
you
meant
it
was
just
a
little
postpostmortem
comedy
giles
smiles
a
little
buffy
gets
up
well
i
i
uh
better
start
prepping
the
slayage
she
begins
wrapping
protective
bandages
on
her
hands
giles
stands
up
too
yes
there
is
always
that
isn't
there
giles
picks
up
his
jacket
seems
that
way
giles
looks
at
her
leaves
cut
to
the
main
magic
shop
room
giles
emerges
from
the
back
the
others
are
still
sitting
around
the
table
except
anya
who
is
standing
giles
anya
goes
to
giles
and
gives
him
a
big
hug
he
smiles
we're
so
glad
to
see
you
we
missed
you
anya
pulls
back
to
look
at
him
you
can't
have
the
store
back
i
know
you
signed
papers
i
did
and
do
we
have
information
on
this
new
demon
that
i
suddenly
find
so
desperately
interesting
giles
gently
moves
anya
aside
and
goes
over
to
the
table
that
we
do
this
one
robs
banks
oh
i
found
him
dawn
gives
giles
the
book
giles
looks
at
book
m'fashnik
oh
aha
like
mmm
cookies
uh
no
quite
different
actually
you
know
it
by
reputation
yes
they
they
come
from
a
long
line
of
mercenary
demons
that
perform
acts
of
slaughter
and
mayhem
for
the
highest
bidder
well
it
is
the
american
way
yes
but
uh
the
question
now
becomes
what's
out
there
powerful
enough
to
control
one
of
these
things
cut
to
a
basement
somewhere
the
m'fashnik
demon
angrily
shoves
over
a
pile
of
boxes
that
look
like
they
recently
held
computer
or
electronics
equipment
he
points
a
finger
and
speaks
to
someone
we
don't
see

had
a

the

to

make

the
demon
grins
evilly
buffy
os
i
know
they're
so
cute
you
could
die
but
cut
to
the
summers
living
room
buffy
stands
holding
up
a
pillow
to
giles
the
pillow
case
is
decorated
in
bright
kiddie
patterns
on
the
coffeetable
is
a
pile
of
similar
sheets
it's
all
i
got
giles
laughs
think
nothing
of
it
it's
it's
uh
whimsical
giles
takes
the
pillow
tosses
it
onto
the
sofa
buffy
begins
unfolding
a
sheet
they
were
mine
when
i
was
little
couldn't
find
the
guest
sheets
buffy
quietly
mom
always
did
this
stuff
buffy
kneels
tries
to
fit
the
sheet
onto
the
sofa
they
don't
actually
fit
giles
leans
over
helps
to
make
the
bed
i
blame
the
sofa
buffy
stands
we
need
one
of
those
pullout
kinds
the
kind
with
no
payments
'til
twothousandandinfinity
what
oh
it's
just
money
stuff
buffy
sits
on
coffee
table
it
turns
out
mom
left
me
some
and
while
i
was
dead
it
got
squandered
on
luxuries
like
food
and
clothing
giles
sits
on
sofa
how
bad
is
it
anya
says
pretty
bad
i'm
kinda
taking
her
word
for
it
actually
i'm
kinda
trying
to
not
think
about
it
sound
policy
at
least
for
tonight
figured
i'd
put
it
out
of
my
mind
you
know
take
a
break
get
some
perspective
and
then
wake
up
at
four
am
terrified
buffy
moves
to
sit
on
the
sofa
beside
giles
holding
the
topsheet
against
her
chest
she
sighs
buffy
perhaps
you're
putting
too
much
pressure
on
yourself
i
mean
to
return
from
some
unknown
level
of
hell
it's
only
natural
that
coming
back
will
be
a
process
in
the
meantime
i'm
scaring
people
well
that
can
take
time
too
buffy
stares
into
the
distance
as
giles
looks
at
her
with
concern
well
if
it's
any
consolation
life
can
be
pretty
overwhelming
even
for
people
who
haven't
been
where
you
have
buffy
softly
i
guess
look
tomorrow
morning
you
and
i
will
sit
down
together
and
we'll
go
through
everything
every
bill
one
by
one
we'll
work
it
out
together
buffy
looks
at
him
they
gaze
at
each
other
i'm
glad
you're
back
well
i'm
glad
you
are
too
giles
reaches
out
to
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
but
she
stands
up
and
walks
off
before
he
can
touch
her
giles
sits
there
looking
concerned
watching
her
go
jonathan
os
are
we
really
gonna
kill
her
cut
back
to
the
geek
trio
conferring
in
their
basement
lair
that's
so
sad
warren
scornfully
shut
up
whineathan
but
i
i
don't
want
to
kill
buffy
either
yeah
she
saved
my
life
a
bunch
of
times
plus
she's
hot
it's
her
or
us
i
mean
we
have
to
do
it
we're
talking
about
murder
no
we're
talking
about
staying
alive
and
since
this
is
my
mom's
house
i
think
what
i
say
goes
but
aside
from
the
moral
issues
and
the
mess
we
can
get
in
trouble
for
murder
duh
you
know
the
last
i
checked
the
authorities
also
frowned
on
bank
robbery
too
genius
i
don't
even
know
if
we
could
kill
buffy
she's
got
superstrength
and
you
know
killing
people
this
is
not
why
we
got
together
in
the
first
place
yeah
we
teamed
up
with
one
clear
supercool
mission
statement
remember
flashcut

the
star
trek
vulcan
salute
they
both
look
at
warren
long
shot
of
the
three
of
them
we
see
the
demon
in
the
background
still
pacing
and
waiting
for
them
to
finish
finally
warren
gives
in
and
holds
up
his
hand
too
agreed
they
all
look
relieved
give
each
other
nervous
looks
so
what
are
we
gonna
do
about
this
mm'fashnik
guy
ah
wait
here
okay
i
got
an
idea
warren
goes
over
to
the
demon
puts
his
arm
around
the
demon's
shoulders
turning
him
away
from
the
other
two
he
reaches
his
other
hand
in
his
pocket
and
pulls
out
a
piece
of
paper
warren
whispers
here's
the
slayer's
name
address
and
telephone
number
you
wanna
kill
her
make
it
so
the
demon
takes
the
paper
with
a
low
growl
leaves
warren
pats
him
on
the
back
turns
around
and
sees
the
others
watching
him
warren
swaggers
back
over
to
them
as
they
stare
impressed
jonathan
awed
how'd
you
make
him
do
that
what
are
you
some
kind
of
jedi
warren
casual
the
force
can
sometimes
have
great
power
on
the
weakminded
andrew
and
jonathan
nod
and
go
hmm
in
awe
cut
to
summers
house
night
giles
comes
into
the
darkened
kitchen
with
a
towel
over
his
shoulder
hey
giles
giles
comes
in
not
smiling
willow
oblivious
you
have
a
good
talk
with
buffy
willow
takes
a
box
of
cookies
or
something
from
the
cupboard
goes
to
sit
by
the
island
giles
closes
the
door
behind
him
yes
now
that
she's
back
willow
smiling
isn't
it
awesome
giles
goes
over
to
the
sink
mmm
giles
removes
his
glasses
tell
me
about
this
spell
you
performed
willow
excited
oh
okay
first
of
all
so
scary
like
the
blair
witch
would
have
had
to
watch
like
this
she
covers
her
eyes
with
one
hand
peeks
through
parted
fingers
then
drops
the
hand
and
grins
giles
looks
grim
willow
continues
not
noticing
his
expression
and
and
and
this
giant
snake
came
out
my
mouth
and
there
was
all
this
energy
crackling
and
this
pack
of
demons
interrupted
but
i
totally
kept
it
together
and
then
the
next
thing
you
know
willow
triumphant
buffy
she
smiles
proudly
takes
out
a
cookie
from
the
box
and
takes
a
bite
giles
has
his
back
to
her
doing
something
in
the
sink
giles
over
his
shoulder
you're
a
very
stupid
girl
willow
pauses
chewing
slowly
stops
smiling
and
frowns
what
giles
giles
turns
to
face
her
do
you
have
any
idea
what
you've
done
the
forces
you've
harnessed
the
lines
you've
crossed
i
thought
you'd
be
impressed
or
or
something
oh
don't
worry
you've
made
a
very
deep
impression
of
everyone
here
you
were
the
one
i
trusted
most
to
respect
the
forces
of
nature
are
you
saying
you
don't
trust
me
giles
intensely
think
what
you've
done
to
buffy
i
brought
her
back
at
incredible
risk
risk
of
what
making
her
deader
of
killing
us
all
unleashing
hell
on
earth
i
mean
shall
i
go
on
no
willow
stands
giles
i
did
what
i
had
to
do
i
did
what
nobody
else
could
do
oh
there
are
others
in
this
world
who
can
do
what
you
did
you
just
don't
want
to
meet
them
giles
turns
away
again
no
probably
not
but
well
they're
the
bad
guys
i'm
not
a
bad
guy
willow
upset
i
brought
buffy
back
into
this
world
aand
maybe
the
word
you
should
be
looking
for
is
congratulations
having
buffy
back
in
the
world
makes
me
feel
indescribably
wonderful
but
i
wouldn't
congratulate
you
if
you
jumped
off
a
cliff
and
happened
to
survive
that's
not
what
i
did
giles
giles
angry
you
were
lucky
i
wasn't
lucky
i
was
amazing
and
how
would
you
know
you
weren't
even
there
if
i
had
been
i'd
have
bloody
well
stopped
you
the
magicks
you
channeled
are
more
ferocious
and
primal
than
anything
you
can
hope
to
understand
giles
even
more
angry
and
you
are
lucky
to
be
alive
you
rank
arrogant
amateur
giles
angrily
grabs
his
towel
and
turns
to
leave
you're
right
he
pauses
by
the
door
looks
back
at
her
the
magicks
i
used
are
very
powerful
i'm
very
powerful
and
maybe
it's
not
such
a
good
idea
for
you
to
piss
me
off
giles
stares
at
her
then
looks
away
after
a
moment
willow
relents
come
on
giles
ii
don't
want
to
fight
i
let's
not
okay
i'll
think
about
what
you
said
and
you
try
to
be
happy
buffy's
back
giles
quietly
we
still
don't
know
where
she
was
or
what
happened
to
her
cut
to
the
back
porch
buffy
stands
there
hugging
herself
we
see
her
from
the
back
giles
os
and
i'm
far
from
convinced
she's
come
out
of
all
this
undamaged
pan
around
to
buffy's
front
she
just
stands
there
looking
blank
suddenly
a
cigarette
butt
lands
on
the
porch
by
buffy's
feet
she
looks
down
puts
out
her
foot
and
grinds
it
out
buffy
not
looking
up
hello
spike
we
see
spike
standing
on
the
lawn
you
hear
all
that
noise
spike
looks
toward
the
kitchen
door
buffy
nods
just
enough
to
make
me
feel
crappy
you
know
watcherboy
doesn't
mean
anything
by
it
spike
comes
closer
steps
onto
the
first
stair
buffy
shrugs
i
guess
everyone

buffy
long
pause
they
all
care
they
all
care
so
much
it
makes
it
all
harder
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
you
around
that
bend
luv
spike
steps
onto
second
stair
i
don't
know
i
just
i
feel
like
i'm
spending
all
of
my
time
trying
to
be
okay
so
they
don't
worry
it's
exhausting
and
then
i
she
trails
off
makes
a
frustrated
gesture
and
then
clenches
her
hand
into
a
fist
and
that
makes
'em
worry
even
more
buffy
looks
at
him
doesn't
reply
spike
walks
the
rest
of
the
way
up
onto
the
porch
comes
to
stand
next
to
her
you
want
me
to
take
them
out
give
me
a
hell
of
a
headache
but
i
could
probably
thin
the
herd
a
little
after
a
moment
buffy
smiles
a
little
spike
looks
pleased
knew
i
could
get
a
grin
they
exchange
a
look
buffy
moves
forward
sits
on
the
top
stair
sighs
deeply
spike
sits
beside
her
why
are
you
always
around
when
i'm
miserable
'cause
that's
when
you're
alone
i
reckon
i'm
not
one
for
crowds
myself
these
days
they
look
at
each
other
again
me
neither
that
works
out
nicely
then
they
sit
there
quietly
staring
out
at
the
night
long
shot
of
the
two
of
them
on
the
porch
so
what
do
you
know
about
finances
