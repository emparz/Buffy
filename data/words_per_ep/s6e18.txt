searing
pokers

intestines
you're
not
in
any
real
pain
what's
wrong
with
me
no
honey
it's
not
you
it's
me
that
anya
xander
frustrated
ohh
she
shoves
past
him
and
goes
storming
toward
the
door
ahn
ahn
wait
please
anya
yanks
the
door
open
and
exits
xander
goes
to
the
door
and
stands
in
the
doorway
looking
down
the
hall
at
her
ahn
so
there
was
no
child
support
in
like
eleven
years
cut
to
a
restaurant
day
halfrek
and
anya
sit
at
a
table
halfrek
holds
a
coffee
cup
anya
is
fiddling
with
a
yellow
flower
not
really
listening
to
halfrek
not
a
single
check
so
now
every
time
he
picks
up
a
piece
of
paper
that
isn't
a
check
for
the
child
paper
cut
halfrek
laughs
cheerfully
anya
is
oblivious
oh
you
know
how
i
hate
to
toot
my
own
horn
but
now
his
hands
are
just
covered
in
all
these
tiny
little
bandages
halfrek
smiling
like
a
quilt
halfrek
chuckles
you
know
made
of
bandages
halfrek
looks
over
at
anya
finally
notices
that
she
isn't
paying
attention
anya
looks
up
hmm
okay
do
they
not
teach
listening
skills
in
human
world
halfrek
puts
down
coffee
cup
i'm
sorry
i
know
anya
puts
the
flower
back
into
its
vase
on
the
table
i'm
just
distracted
what
about
this
thing
with
xander
don't
worry
you'll
figure
out
a
way
to
anya
no
that's
just
it
i've
tried
everything
i
tried
every
curse
i
knew
nothing's
worked
wait
did
you
try
to
curse
him
yourself
yeah
i
am
the
wronged
party
here
of
course
i
halfrek
you
can't
exact
justice
against
someone
on
behalf
of
yourself
silly
anya
laughs
how
long
have
you
been
away
i
haven't
been
scorned
by
a
man
in
like
a
thousand
years
i
never
had
to
make
a
wish
for
myself
there
has
to
be
some
way
around
that
well

halfrek
thinks
you
could
try
getting
someone
to
make
the
wish
for
you
i
suppose
anya
stares
at
her
contemplating
this
a
very
small
smile
appears
on
her
face
cut
to
exterior
summers
house
day
cut
to
the
kitchen
dawn
walks
in
and
stares
at
the
kitchen
island
uh
did
we
open
a
chain
close
shot
on
the
island
set
with
two
place
settings
bowls
of
fruit
four
bottles
of
syrup
reveal
buffy
standing
by
the
stove
holding
a
spatula
and
frying
pan
several
cereal
boxes
lined
up
on
the
counter
are
we
the
international
house
of
something
nope
got
up
early
and
it
felt
like
a
breakfast
kind
of
morning
buffy
puts
pancakes
from
the
pan
onto
a
plate
okay
what
kind
of
syrup
do
you
want
on
your
pancakes
dawn
amazed
syrups
have
kinds
oh
also
you
know
i
was
thinking
buffy
turns
away
to
put
the
pan
in
the
sink
after
the
mall
yesterday
maybe
we
we
shouldn't
go
out
tonight
you
know
maybe
we
could
stay
in
and
uh
buffy
taking
toast
from
the
toaster
ow
um
you
know
get
a
pizza
or
uh
rent
a
movie
um
buffy
putting
plateful
of
toast
on
the
island
also
i
didn't
know
if
you
know
if
you
had
plans
this
weekend
buffy
turns
to
grab
the
cereal
boxes
but
i
thought
maybe
we
could
hey
buffy
buffy
pauses
looking
at
dawn
with
a
large
armful
of
cereal
boxes
dawn
quietly
i'm
gonna
be
okay
with
the
basement
thing
really
you
weren't
you
buffy
quietly
this
isn't
guilt
i
want
us
to
spend
time
okay
good
i
love
spending
time
buffy
dawn
realizing
but
i'm
cramping
your
teenage
style
no
buffy
yes
i
am
dawn
alarmed
i'm
the
embarrassing
mom
who
tries
too
hard
when
did
this
happen
dawn
smiling
no
you're
not
it's
not
that
it's
just
what
if
instead
of
you
hanging
out
with
me
maybe
i
could
hang
out
with
you
buffy
stares
blankly
not
getting
it
why
don't
i
come
patrolling
with
you
tonight
oh
and
then
maybe
we
can
invite
over
some
strangers
and
ask
them
to
feed
you
candy
well
you
guys
went
out
patrolling
every
night
when
you
were
my
age
true
but
technically
you're
oneandahalf
dawn
gives
her
patented
adolescent
exasperated
look
see
i
thought
a
little
levity
might
but
okay
also
no
i
just
i
just
think
i
could
help
i'm
sure
you
could
but
it's
a
little
more
dangerous
than
i
had
in
mind
but
buffy
dawn
i
work
very
hard
to
keep
you
away
from
that
stuff
okay
i
don't
want
you
around
dangerous
things
that
can
kill
you
which
would
be
a
perfectly
reasonable
argument
if
my
sister
was
chosen
to
protect
the
world
from
tax
audits
but
see
my
sister
is
you
and
dangerous
things
that
want
to
kill
me
seem
to
find
me
but
you
don't
need
to
go
looking
for
them
beat
dawn
gives
buffy
a
pleading
look
now
eat
up
you're
gonna
be
late
for
school
buffy
turns
back
to
the
stove
dawn
sighs
quietly
and
sits
down
cut
to
the
espresso
pump
day
tara
os
okay
wait
it
was
under
her
wig
pan
across
various
customers
to
reveal
tara
and
willow
sitting
at
a
table
with
cups
of
coffee
both
smiling
as
willow
tells
the
story
of
the
old
lady
in
episode
double
meat
palace
well
it
was
this
thing
it
just
came
out
from
inside
her
head
that's
disgusting
what
did
it
look
like
well
let's
put
it
this
way
if
i
wasn't
gay
before
tara
laughing
god
and
this
was
after
the
invisible
ray
yep
okay
i'm
gone
for
a
couple
of
months
willow
oh
did
i
tell
you
about
the
demon
eggs
see
now
now
i
know
you're
just
trying
to
make
me
jealous
willow
grinning
so
what
no
rollicking
adventures
in
the
dorms
tara
quieter
mm
it's
not
the
same
it's
not
like
living
with
a
house
full
of
family
or
sharing
a
room
with
someone
you
are
friends
with
as
they
gaze
at
each
other
anya
walks
up
hi
oh
my
god
you're
back
willow
hugs
anya
we've
been
so
worried
yeah
sorry
i
needed
to
you
know
i
couldn't
stay
here
not
after
everything
that
happened
no
no
no
we
we
totally
understand
but
you're
back
now
right
it's
complicated
anya
sits
you
know
and
there's
a
lot
to
deal
with
well
if
there's
anything
we
can
do
just
let
us
anya
actually
um
there
is
an
eensy
something
i
could
use
a
little
help
with
you're
lesbians
so
the
hating
of
men
will
come
in
handy
willow
and
tara
look
at
each
other
in
puzzlement
anya
cheerfully
let's
talk
about
xander
cut
to
magic
shop
day
close
on
dawn
he
feels
awful
reveal
anya
facing
dawn
you
think
it's
anywhere
close
to
what
i
feel
no
but
anya
what
if
it
were
you
dawn
what
if
all
you
dreamed
about
was
that
magical
day
dawn
dawn
looking
chastised
the
day
when
the
one
person
you
loved
with
all
your
soul
would
promise
to
cherish
and
protect
your
heart
for
the
rest
of
his
life
but
instead
he
shatters
it
into
a
million
jagged
pieces
cut
back
to
the
coffee
shop
well
it's
it's
not
really
so
much
about
hating
the
men
we're
more
centered
around
the

willow
smirking
girl
on
girl
action
willow
tara
grinning
and
men
really
like
to
watch
that
kind
of
stuff
don't
they
men
like
xander
cut
to
exterior
summers
house
day
anya
and
buffy
stand
on
the
front
porch
leaning
against
the
two
pillars
on
either
side
of
the
door
facing
each
other
i
don't
think
he
could
feel
any
worse
let's
test
that
theory
anya
xander's
my
friend
i
know
what
he
did
was
wrong
and
if
it
had
happened
to
me
i'd
anya
buffy
hopefully
wish
his
penis
would
explode
cut
back
to
the
magic
shop
i
never
use
that
word
anymore
coagulate
wish
oh
wish
as
in
'i
wish
xander'
dawn
right
that
word
there's
vengeance
demons
out
there
that
are
still
active
remember
any
'i
wish'
could
totally
end
in
horrible
grossness
gimme
a
forinstance
cut
to
the
summers
porch
i
don't
really
think
i
should
did
i
mention
the
whole
'left
at
the
altar'
thing
didn't
leave
that
out
did
i
no
buffy
shakes
head
look
i
i
know
what
he
did
was
wrong
god
if
it
happened
to
me
i
ii
it
must
have
been
torture
anya
excited
okay
let's
talk
about
torture
cut
to
the
magic
shop
dawn
looks
very
dubious
so
tell
me
more
about
wishing
xander's
brains
and
guts
would
go
blooey
i
didn't
say
that
yes
you
did
no
i
didn't
i
heard
you
i
swear
i
didn't
say
that
didn't
say
what
um
i
just
saw
you
were
back
and
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
working
off
my
debt
dawn
nervous
chuckle
you
know
my
whole
stickyfingers
grabbyhands
thing
oh
right
the
mad
thieving
good
yes
there
's
much
to
do
anya
mock
stern
i'm
gonna
put
you
to
work
missy
anya
gives
a
fake
laugh
dawn
continues
to
look
dubiously
at
her
so
back
to
xander's
brains
and
guts
cut
to
the
summers
porch
now
anya
and
buffy
are
sitting
on
the
step
squish
squish
squish
guys
have
been
running
roughshod
over
you
for
years
anya
buffy
nodding
pouting
reluctantly
agreeing
torturing
that
perky
little
ticker
aren't
you
sick
of
it
don't
you
wish
guys
like
that
buffy
whoa
guys
there
have
only
been
four
three
three
three
guys
that's
barely
plural
and
didn't
each
of
them
rip
your
heart
out
don't
men
like
that
as
to
pick
an
example
xander
deserve
to
be
punished
cut
to
the
coffee
shop
well
xander
is
a
guy
so

willow
tara
looking
confused
it's
kinda
not
the
surprise
that
he
likes
to
watch
girls
why
are
we
talking
about
this
anya
annoyed
we're
comforting
me
well
ii
guess
it's
natural
for
guys
to
be
interested
in
anya
god
what
kind
of
lesbians
are
you
if
you
love
men
so
much
go
love
men
anya
jumps
up
and
grabs
her
togo
coffee
cup
storms
off
cut
to
the
summers
porch
anya
has
stood
up
there
too
and
started
to
storm
off
anya
i
know
you're
hurting
but
anya
what
xander
doesn't
deserve
to
suffer
for
what
he
did
'cause
he's
your
friend
and
i'm
not
right
i
get
it
no
that's
not
what
i'm
saying
at
all
what
he
did
was
wrong
he
knows
that
anya
upset
it
just
it
hurts
he
hurt
me
so
much
buffy
gets
up
he
really
did
buffy
puts
hand
on
anya's
arm
look
ii
wish
that
xander
os
anya
xander
walks
up
buffy
and
anya
look
at
him
anya
angry
well
congratulations
they
all
still
love
you
even
after
what
you
did
to
me
she
starts
to
walk
off
xander
starts
to
follow
but
buffy
grabs
him
anya
wait
okay
not
not
crazy
about
that
idea
what
are
you
doing
i
have
to
go
after
her
or
in
the
land
of
the
sane
you
could
give
her
some
space
let
her
cool
down
xander
frustrated
that's
not
proactive
guy
xander
pacing
that's
sitaroundand
watchtherestofyourlifetoturntocrap
guy
as
xander
paces
we
get
a
shot
of
the
tree
on
the
front
lawn
there
are
a
few
straggly
plants
around
the
tree's
base
and
a
little
ceramic
garden
gnome
nestled
among
the
plants
true
uh
but
at
least
crap
guy
gets
to
keep
all
of
his
appendages
and
i'm
supposed
to
what
walk
away
xander
buffy
looking
sympathetic
shouldn't
be
too
hard
it's
what
i'm
good
at
right
xander
kicks
out
in
frustration
smashing
the
garden
gnome
okay
see
that's
exactly
why
a
hearttoheart
is
probably
not
your
best
course
of
action
right
now
buffy
xander
still
pacing
when
you're
both
angry
and
upset
and
what
the
hell
is
that
creepy
little
thing
doing
in
my
yard
buffy
walks
forward
looking
down
at
the
bits
of
gnome
xander
looks
at
them
too
did
willow
put
that
there
when
i
was
dead
'cause
if
i
had
known
i
would
have
crawled
out
of
the
grave
sooner
to
xander
buffy
they
both
kneel
beside
the
gnome's
head
we
can
clearly
see
a
tiny
camera
inside
it
xander
picks
it
up
oh
my
god
looks
like
someone's
been
keeping
an
eye
on
all
your
ins
and
outs
what
the
who
well
now
let's
see
who's
obsessed
with
buffy
who
likes
to
hang
out
in
her
yard
and
keep
an
eye
on
her
who's
in
love
with
you
and
not
getting
any
buffy
looks
grim
cut
to
closeup
of
a
hand
holding
the
camera
what's
this
we
see
that
we're
in
spike's
crypt
spike
is
holding
the
camera
up
to
look
at
it
as
buffy
stands
confronting
him
it's
a
camera
yeah
i
got
that
part
why
am
i
holding
it
someone
was
using
it
to
spy
on
me
on
my
house
buffy
spike
frowning
xander
thinks
it's
you
oh
the
great
xander
thinks
so
shudder
gasp
it
must
be
true
spike
spike
that
ponce
has
always
had
it
for
me
every
chance
he
gets
he
sticks
it
he
pauses
looking
at
buffy
spike
outraged
you
believe
him
don't
you
you
think
i
was
spying
on
you
buffy
doesn't
answer
you
think
i
could
do
that
because
you
don't
lie
or
cheat
or
steal
or
manipulate
spike
gives
her
back
the
camera
spike
quietly
i
don't
hurt
you
he
walks
a
few
steps
away
i
know
no
you
don't
i've
tried
to
make
it
clear
to
you
but
you
won't
see
it
spike
pauses
something
happened
to
me
the
way
i
feel
about
you
it's
different
and
no
matter
how
hard
you
try
to
convince
yourself
it
isn't
it's
real
i
think
it
is
beat
he
looks
at
her
for
you
she
turns
to
walk
away
spike
looks
hurt
buffy
pauses
by
the
door
turns
back
i
know
that's
not
what
you
want
to
hear
i'm
sorry
i
really
am
but
spike
you
have
to
move
on
you
have
to
get
over
spike
buffy
softly
get
out
buffy
looks
grim
turns
and
leaves
cut
to
magic
shop
anya
stands
behind
the
counter
talking
to
halfrek
who
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
counter
sitting
on
a
stool
no
they're
all
'oh
poor
xander
it
took
so
much
out
of
him
all
that
running
away
he
did'
i
just
don't
understand
what's
wrong
with
these
people
did
you
really
think
they
were
the
ones
who
would
help
you
well
but
halfrek
do
you
want
retribution
anyanka
i
want
xander
good
and
cursed
then
you
know
what
you
have
to
do
get
a
wish
from
someone
who
doesn't
freaking
love
him
exactly
yeah
but
my
social
circle
is
a
little
limited
here
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
just
stumble
upon
someone
who
doesn't
give
a
fig's
ass
if
xander
gets
hurt
the
bell
over
the
magic
shop
door
jingles
as
spike
enters
he
slams
the
door
shut
and
strides
toward
anya
hey
i
need
a
thing
zoom
in
on
anya
as
she
gazes
speculatively
at
him
blackout
act
iii

same
scene
halfrek
and
anya
looking
at
spike
so
what's
your
pleasure
fresh
of
out
of
pleasure
that's
why
i'm
here
spike
sighs
i
need
something
numbing
spell
maybe
anya
fake
smile
uh
huh
hang
on
halfrek
smiles
and
gets
up
as
anya
walks
to
the
end
of
the
counter
halfrek
moves
that
way
too
so
they
can
talk
privately
we
see
that
anya
is
wearing
a

and
matching
red
cardigan
anya
quietly
smiling
oh

to
wish
dammit

only
he
were
a
woman
anya
thinks
got
it
if
i
can
somehow
get
someone
to
wish

easier
way

this
whole
femalepower

night
thing

been
telling
you
for
decades
men
need
a
little
vengeance
now
and
then
too
oh
anya
looks
over
at
spike
maybe
this
is
a
good
chance
to
try
it
out
halfrek
gives
a
cheerful
little
wave
at
spike
and
heads
for
the
door
good
luck
with
that
tata
she
leaves
anya
smiles
nervously
at

up
the
little
girls'
night
out
anya
walking
toward
him
that's
okay
i'm
ready
to
do
some
business
right
then

something
that'll
dull
the
ache
a
bit
anya
smiling
actually
yes
anya
walks
back
behind
the
counter
um
giles
left
a
couple
of
supplies
here
and
i
think
this
might
help
she
bends
over
begins
rummaging
in
the
cabinet
under
the
cash
register
eases
the
hurt
makes
the
sun
shine
a
little
brighter
anya
spike
frowning
even
makes
boring
people
seem
more
interesting
ah
here
she
produces
a
bottle
of
whiskey
and
puts
it
on
the
countertop
with
a
clank
spike
grins
cut
to
close
shot
on
a
table
strewn
with
various
colored
wires
the
camera
from
the
garden
gnome
sits
there
with
several
wires
attached
a
hand
attaches
another
wire
to
it
we
see
a
laptop
computer
next
to
the
camera
pan
up
to
reveal
buffy
sitting
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
the
location
is
the
summers
dining
room
how's
it
coming
can
you
see
who's
getting
the
camera's
signal
reveal
willow
sitting
in
front
of
the
computer
xander
stands
beside
the
table
should
have
something
once
i
get
tapped
into
the
fiberoptic
network
we're
gonna
use
the
feedback
relay
to
uh
get
their
signal
routed
into
our
system
okay
if
it's
not
spike
and
i'm
i'm
not
saying
i
believe
him
but
if
it's
not
spike
i
think
we
already
know
who's
behind
this
willow
typing
makes
sense
buffy
grimly
i
want
to
find
these
guys
cut
to
the
geek
trio
lair
green
blue
yellow
liquids
bubble
in
the
chemistry
set
jonathan
lights
a
red
candle
on
the
table
next
to
the
chemistry
stuff
warren
and
andrew
stand
watching
we
see
that
there's
an
old
map
spread
out
on
the
floor
a
few
feet
away
jonathan
holds
a
short
wooden
rod
with
the
magic
disk
attached
to
the
end
of
it
he
positions
it
in
front
of
the
candle
and
sprinkles
some
powder
over
the
disk
close
shot
on
the
disk
as
the
powder
makes
it
glow
redhot
and
give
off
purple
smoke
uncover
a
beam
of
purple
light
shoots
from
the
candle
through
the
disk
and
onto
the
map
we
see
that
the
map
is
labeled
map
of
sunnydale
the
light
lands
on
a
single
point
on
the
map
there
that's
it
that's
where
we
have
to
go
well
now
that
we've
found
out
where
we're
supposed
to
go
suddenly
the
map
bursts
into
flame
where
the
beam
of
light
is
touching
it
they
all
yell
yah
jonathan
screams
and
runs
off
cut
to
magic
shop
night
spike
is
sitting
on
the
stool
beside
the
counter
anya
still
standing
behind
the
counter
they
both
have
shot
glasses
and
are
in
the
process
of
drinking
the
shots
spike
angrily
so
then
this
girl
says
real
for
you
anya
right
but
getting
back
to
xander
spike
scornful
xander
let's
not
waste
any
more
breath
on
that
wanker
but
he
made
a
fool
of
me
and
nobody
seems
to
care
enough
to
do
anything
i
care
what
he
done
to
you
i've
never
stooped
that
low
and
i'm
an
'evil
soulless
thing'
spike
bitterly
according
to
some
people
but
shouldn't
he
pay
don't
you
wish
he
had
to
pay
in
some
horrible
way
absolutely
spike
picks
up
the
whiskey
bottle
and
his
shot
glass
turns
to
walk
over
to
the
round
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
take
him
on
myself
if
it
wasn't
for
my
little
handicap
spike
gesturing
at
his
head
anya
comes
out
from
behind
the
counter
bringing
her
glass
right
anya
sits
so
hypothetically
what
do
you
wish
you
could
do
to
him
anya
spike
pouring
fresh
shots
for
both
of
them
you
name
it
pet
you're
the
wronged
party
something
uh
spike
lifts
his
glass
gruesome
how
'bout
spike
drinks
anya
maintains
her
fakecheerful
smile
drinks
also
cut
to
geek
trio
lair
andrew
and
warren
are
stomping
on
the
fire
trying
to
put
it
out
jonathan
runs
in
with
a
fire
extinguisher
warren
grabs
a
blanket
off
the
sofa
and
tosses
it
on
the
fire
trying
to
smother
it
he
and
andrew
continue
stomping
hey
that's
my
blanket
well
makes
sense
it
was
your
fire
behind
warren's
head
we
see
a
red
lightbulb
suddenly
light
up
cut
to
summers
dining
room
willow
still
working
on
her
laptop
hey
hey
i
think
i've
got
something
buffy
and
xander
now
both
sitting
look
over
at
her
cut
to
magic
shop
spike
and
anya
sit
facing
each
other
on
the
bench
next
to
the
round
table
anya
gestures
wildly
with
the
bottle
she
has
removed
her
cardigan
sweater
and
now
just
wears
the
red
tank
top
over
her
red
skirt
anya
angrily
thing
about
it
is
none
of
this
was
my
idea
anya
disgusted
i
didn't
ask
to
be
human
anya
pouring
right
and
i
didn't
ask
for
this
bloody
chip
in
my
head
to
tell
you
the
truth

anya
puts
bottle
down
all
i
wanted
was
to
use
him
and
lose
him
i
hadn't
had
a
good
tumble
in
a
thousand
years
spike
grinning
me
too
the
using
part
i
just
wanted
to
know
what
i
was
missing
move
on
anya
maudlin
yeah
and
he
was
all
bumpy
in
the
right
places
and
nice
to
me
she
trails
off
looking
wistful
spike
looks
the
same
way
spike
softly
she
was
so
raw
i've
never
felt
anything
like
it
next
thing
you
know
i'm
changing
to
please
him
anya
a
little
more
upset
i
care
if
he
cares
spike
nodding
right
and
i'm
off
my
guard
happy
i'm
singing
in
the
shower
and
doing
my
sexy
dance
exactly
spike
pauses
i
have
no
dance
he
looks
sternly
at
anya
as
if
to
make
sure
she's
buying
it
she
nods
but
frowns
a
little
cut
back
to
the
dining
room
willow
continues
typing
talk
to
me
will
technology's
pretty
sophisticated
lots
of
booby
traps
and
firewall
stuff
willow
shot
of
the
screen
showing
a
radar
diagram
of
concentric
circles
but
can
you
get
us
a
location
well
hey
i'm
still
me

one
whoa

'em
to
the
rafters
they
clink
their
glasses
together
and
drink
i
did
everything
for
that
man
was
it
ever
enough
never
spike
slurred
i
was
always
going
above
and
beyond
i
saved
the
scoobies
how
many
times
and
i
can't
stand
the
lot
of
you
me
either
i
hate
us
everybody's
so
nice
nobody
says
what's
on
their
mind
you
do
that's
why
you're
the
only
one
of
them
i
wouldn't
bite
if
i
had
the
chance
anya
giggles
pleased
really
absolutely
i
have
nothing
but
respect
for
a
woman
who
is
forthright
drusilla
was
always
straightforward
didn't
have
a
single
buggering
clue
about
what
was
going
on
in
front
of
her
spike
anya
giggling
but
she
was
straight
about
it
that's
a
virtue
mm
xander
didn't
think
so
he
thought
i
was
rude
spike
like
'duh'
that's
because
he's
one
of
them
uptight
repressed
spike
makes
uptight
gesture
with
one
finger
anya
frowning
you
think
please
it's
no
wonder
they
couldn't
deal
with
the
likes
of
you
and
me
luv
we
should
have
been
dead
hundreds
of
years
ago
and
we're
the
only
ones
who
are
really
alive
anya
smiles
gazing
down
at
him
he
looks
up
at
her
they
both
smile
at
each
other
cut
to
the
dining
room
on
willow's
laptop
screen
we
can
see
a
tiny
image
of
the
exterior
of
the
doublemeat
palace
oh
my
god
the
double
meat
palace
willow
image
changes
the
bronze
my
classes
on
campus
close
on
the
screen
showing
an
overhead
shot
of
a

then
it

to
an
image
of
a
deserted
construction
site
willow

willow
xander
looking
surprised
what
they've

i'm
just
having
a
harder
time
pinpointing
'em
here
lemme
willow
typing
cut
back
to
magic
box
anya
is
sitting
on
the
bench
again
closer
to
spike
than
before
the
bottle
is
nearly
empty
spike
picks
it
up
with
a
sigh
pours
the
last
of
it
into
one
shot
glass
here
spike
picks
up
glass
holds
it
toward
her
ladies
last
anya
gazing
sentimentally
at
him
thank
you
take
it
quick
or
my
chivalry'll
run
out
no

anya
puts
her
hand
on
spike's
thank
you
spike
frowns
a
little
puts
the
glass
down
moves
a
little
closer
to
her
this
is
the
first
time
since

anya
shrugs
it
feels
good
to
be
with
someone
who
understands
spike
softly
intimately
spike
sighs
this
whole
time
i've
been
coming
on
all
hellbent
and
mad
wanting
his
head
you
know
yeah
when
really
i

anya
tearfully
can't
sleep
at
night
thinking
it
has
to
be
my
fault
somehow
spike
shakes
his
head
shh
anya
crying
what
if
it
was
just
pretending
what
if
he
never
wanted
me
the
way
i
wanted
him
she
snaps
out
of
it
a
little
shakes
her
head
ohh
i'm
sorry
now
now
spike
gently
brushes
some
hair
out
of
anya's
face
then
cups
her
cheek
in
his
hand
he
would
have
to
be
more
than
just
the
git
he
is
anya
he'd
have
to
be
deaf
dumb
and
blind
not
to
want
a
woman
like
you
anya
whispers
then
why
spike
looks
away
sadly
the
two
of
them
they're
weak
is
all
spike
pauses
but
i'll
tell
you
what
though
spike
continues
stroking
anya's
face
they'll
uh
miss
the
water
now
that
the
well's
gone
dry
now
spike
has
his
fingers
under
anya's
chin
and
she
leans
her
face
into
his
hand
anya
quietly
too
hot
to
handle
too
hot
he
leans
forward
very
close
leans
his
forehead
against
hers
um
justjust
one
more
question
hmm
anya
very
softly
can
i
see
your
sexy
dance
spike
small

this
'cause
i'm
i'm
lonely
and
drunk
and
you

she
grins
and
nods
and
they
resume
kissing
cut
to
geek
lair
the
red
light
continues
flashing

accompanied
by
a
loud
alarm
noise
the
geeks
look
over

along

wall
cut
back

kissing
continues
as
anya
climbs
onto
spike's
lap
straddling
him
he
pushes
his
hands
up
underneath
her
shirt
and
pushes
the
shirt
up
revealing
a
black
bra
cut

the

jonathan

spike
sweeps
a
pile
of
stuff
including
the
empty
liquor
bottle
off
the
table
with
one
arm
then
retreats
out
of
shot
so
all
we
see
is
the
bare
table
then
spike's
hands
place
anya
on
the
table
now
wearing
just
her
black
bra
and
short
red
skirt

lies
back
on

spike
moves
on

of
her
between
her
legs
they
resume
kissing

to
the
dining

i
think
i've

continues
typing
and
looking
at

room
sees
something
zoom
in
on
her
face
looking
upset
zoom
in
on
the
weapons
chest
that
xander
made
for
buffy
episode
older
and
far
away
its
lid
is
open
and
the
weapons
are
in
disarray
cut
to
the
street
xander
walks
along
walking
fast
with
a
grim
look
on
his
face
pan
down
to
reveal
the
shorthandled
axe
in
his
hand
blackout
act
iv

open
on
the
summers
back
yard
night
buffy
sits
in
one
of
the
wooden
lawn
chairs
staring
blankly
dawn
stands
nearby
her
arms
folded
across
her
chest
so
this
is
it
this
is
the
stuff
you've
been
protecting
me
from
you
and
spike
and
a
lot
of
monsters
uhhuh
but
it's
over
buffy
dawn
sitting
in
the
other
chair
spike
i
wish
you'd
told
me
i
kinda
didn't
wanna
admit
it
to
myself
i
get
that
buffy
continues
staring
at
the
ground
i
know
it
must
hurt
to
feel
like
you
have
to
hide
to
keep
secrets
from
everybody
buffy
looks
at
dawn
pensively
willow
bursts
out
the
back
door
of
the
house
buffy
xander's
gone
he
took
your
axe
cut
to
magic
box
pan
across
the
assorted
stuff
scattered
on
the
floor
the
bench
is
lying
on
its
side
there's
also
a
tippedover
chair
with
anya's
sweater
hanging
on
it
anya
wearing
her
tank
top
again
picks
up
the
sweater
in
background
we
see
spike
fastening
his
belt
anya
has
her
back
to
him
he
looks
over
at
her
close
on
anya
looking
a
little
ashamed
or
embarrassed
pan
to
spike
looking
the
same
spike
finishes
with
his
belt
and
starts
walking
toward
the
door
as
anya
puts
on
her
sweater
staring
blankly
into
space
spike
pauses
by
the
door
and
they
both
turn
to
face
each
other
from
across
the
room
anya
gives
a
little
nod
and
after
a
moment
spike
nods
back
he
turns
and
opens
the
door
walks
out
cut
to
exterior
of
the
shop
spike
exits
and
immediately
looks
shocked
at
something
directly
in
front
of
him
he
dodges
to
the
right
and
the
shorthandled
axe
plunges
into
the
wall
behind
where
he
just
was
shot
of
xander
struggling
to
pull
the
axe
free
spike
stares
at
him
in
some
alarm
xander
gives
up
on
the
axe
grabs
spike
by
the
front
of
his
shirt
and
throws
him
down
on
the
sidewalk
shot
of
buffy
running
around
a
corner
farther
down
the
street
running
hard
toward
them
xander
picks
spike
up
and
throws
him
against
a
pillar
grabs
him
and
turns
him
around
punches
him
in
the
gut
spike
doubles
over
get
up
get
up
spike
glares
up
at
him
but
doesn't
move
you're
just
gonna
sit
there
do
nothing
spike
doesn't
answer
xander
grabs
him
pulls
him
to
his
feet
and
slams
his
head
against
the
pillar
that
the
kinda
man
you
are
i'm
not
gonna
fight
you
chip
xander
knees
him
in
the
stomach
spike
groans
and
doubles
over
again
too
bad
xander
pulls
a
stake
from
his
pocket
just
as
anya
opens
the
door
and
sees
them
xander
no
stop
it
stop
it
stop
it
anya
runs
over
distracting
xander
she
reaches
him
just
as
buffy
does
coming
up
behind
him
and
shoving
him
aside
xander
pants
and
glares
at
buffy
she
pants
and
glares
back
xander
i
xander
panting
don't
even
try
to
deny
it
'cause
i
saw
it
all
the
whole
beautiful
show
how
xander
glares
angrily
at
her
it
was
just
it
it
was
just
a
thing

i
felt
bad
and
he
was
just
there
buffy
to
spike

it
buffy
spike
looking
sourly
at
her
xander
still
yelling
at

when
this
is
your
solution
to
our
problems
i
hurt
you
and
you
hit
me
back
very
mature
no
the
mature
solution
is
for
you
to
spend
your
whole
life
telling
stupid
pointless
jokes
so
that
no
one
will
notice
that
you
are
just
a
scared
insecure
little
boy
xander
bitterly
i'm
not
joking

let
that
evil
soulless
thing

pointing
at
spike

wanted
me
to

stares
at

sex
with

xander
points
at

a
bit
ashamed

quietly

good
enough
for
buffy

yells
shut
up
and

of

on
the
ground

don't
want
to
know
any
of
this
he
walks
off

to
glare
at

resigned

turns
and
follows

or
waste
one
tear
on
compromise

unhappily
at
the
mess

heartache
in
disguise

slowly
walks
down

three
steps
into

lying
on

edge
of
the
bed

much
to
work
through

be
built
again
on
both
sides
