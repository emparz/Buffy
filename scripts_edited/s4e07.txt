forrest: women. young, nubile, exciting. each one a mystery, waiting to be unlocked. think any of them are gonna show? 'cause the party will be lame if we lack for hotties. professor? you with me?
riley: no. i'm with this large pile of ungraded papers, due at 3:00.
forrest: how are you gonna learn anything if you keep doing schoolwork? oh...check her out. is she hot, or is she hot?
scene direction: see buffy at the soda fountain. she's distracted and her cup starts to overflow.
scene direction: riley looks up
riley: she's buffy.
forrest: buffy? i like that. that girl's so hot, she's buffy.
riley: it's her name, forrest.
forrest: you've established first contact? excellent. what do you think of her?
riley: i haven't really thought about what i think of her.
forrest: a girl that cute in the face, and you form no opinion?
riley: no, i mean, she's all right, i guess. she's just kind of... i don't know. peculiar.
scene direction: buffy breaks the handle off of the frozen yogurt machine. she battles with it for a bit.
forrest: peculiar? hi. hey, graham, what do you think of the blonde chick? mattressable, n'est pas? riley's not down. doesn't like her.
riley: i don't dislike her. she just-- she never feels like she's really there when you talk to her. i like girls i can get a grip on.
forrest: i bet you do.
riley: not that way. just a little less ready for takeoff all the time. there's definitely something off about her.
graham: maybe she's canadian.
scene direction: buffy flees the site and see the yogurt machine overflowing in her wake.
forrest: didn't she go out with parker abrams for about 30 seconds?
riley: abrams? yeah, there's a sign of good taste.
scene direction: buffy goes to the register and pays for her food.
forrest: ok, but you've got to admit she's a major league hottie.
riley: well, i'm not denying she's easy on the eyes. i'm just saying...  buffy spills both drink and yogurt on the floor.
riley: would you really want to go out with her?
forrest: hell, yes. i bet a lot of guys would like to get their hands on her.
scene change: cut to spike laying on the floor of a sanitary hospital white chamber. he's mumbling as he drifts towards consciousness.
spike: slayer... i'll kill you. not so tough. i... kill slayer.
scene direction: he gets up and looks around. he goes to the glass wall that holds him in and puts his hands on it. he receives a severe electric shock and jumps back. the camera pans back and there are dozens of other cages with vampires and other ilk locked up.
scene change: *** scene transition ***
scene change: cut to giles apartment. he and xander are sitting in his living room. he's adding finishing touches to a drawing.
giles: well, based on buffy's description, i believe the men that we're after look something like, um... like this.
scene direction: he holds up the drawing.
xander: the latest in fall fascism. i like it. a bit full in the hips for my taste, but-- giles: oh, i think we can safely assume they're human, so, um, no research needed.
xander: no studying? damn! next thing they'll tell me is i'll have to eat jelly doughnuts or sleep with a supermodel to get things done around here. i ask you, how much can one man give?
giles: not too much, i'm afraid. um... once again i'd say that you and i will not be needed to help buffy.
xander: really?
giles: really.
xander: well, how about this? we whip out the ouija board, light a few candles, summon some ancient, unstoppable evil. mayhem, mayhem, mayhem. we show up and kick its ass.
scene direction: buffy walks in the apartment.
giles: wee bit unethical.
buffy: hello, people. hey. mmm.  giles hold up the sketch.
giles: it's my late night storm trooper pal.
giles: it's--it's just for reference, you know, but fairly accurate you'd say?
buffy: that's your man.
giles: your man, actually. uh...you are patrolling tonight?
buffy: nope, i am going to a party tonight. hopefully, a "no fighting, no biting" kind of deal.
giles: look, buffy, somebody's got to find out who these people are.
buffy: giles, i live in a dorm now. the girls in my hall want to party, willow needs some cheering up. i'm going to take her.
xander: how's will dealing-- buffy:
scene direction: xander cutting off xander
xander: with the black hole of despair she's been living in since oz left? she's dealing. i'm helping. it's hard. ergo, party. you two can take patrol. now, if you'll excuse me, i need to go find something slutty to wear tonight.
scene change: cut to the facility that spike is being held at. he's pacing around when a packet of blood falls from a panel in the ceiling. he grabs it and goes to start in on it.
scene direction: see the vampire that was captured in the first episode, a leftover from sunday's gang.
vampire: don't drink it. it's drugged.
scene direction: spike throws down the pack, frustrated
spike: uh-huh. and who are you, mate?
vampire: i'm a rat. i'm a lab rat, just like the others. they're gonna kill us, you know.
spike: and how are they gonna do that?
vampire: they starve you. when you're ready to bite your own arm, they shoot out one of those packets. you drink, and the next thing, you're gone. and that's when they do the experiments.
spike: and, uh, they are? the government? nazis? a major cosmetics company?
vampire: who cares? all i know is, one minute i'm running from the slayer, and the next thing, i'm here.
spike: the slayer! i knew it! i knew it!
vampire: yeah, she took apart my crew, and led me straight to these guys.
spike: she set me up, too. i always worried what would happen when that bitch got some funding.
scene direction: spike slams his hands into the glass wall briefly in frustration
spike: she's wised up a bit. fine! i'll take her apart. i don't care how brilliant she is.
scene change: cut to prof. walsh's class. buffy is fighting with her pen and her hands are covered in ink.

walsh: i'll see you all tomorrow.
scene direction: buffy and willow collect their things to leave. willow goes up to riley.
willow: riley. i notice you left off a name today in roll call. osbourne, daniel osbourne, oz?
riley: he's not in this class anymore. i hear he dropped out.
scene direction: willow looking distressed
willow: oh, well you heard way wrong then. i mean, he's not gone. he--he left temporarily to work out a few things. i know that sounds lame in its vagueness, but i assure you, oz will be back.
scene direction: walsh walks up to where willow and riley are
walsh: not to my class, he won't. an educated guess. you know the rules, you know i hate exceptions, and yet somehow you feel your exception is exceptional.
scene direction: walsh crosses her arms in front of her looking intimidating
willow: oh, but-- walsh:
scene direction: willow cutting her off
willow: it is. to you. but since i'm neither a freshman nor a narcissist, i have to consider the whole class. if your friend can't respect my schedule, i think it's best he not come back.
scene direction: willow looking hurt and miserable walks off.
scene direction: buffy who's been watching from the sidelines walks up to walsh.
buffy: you know, for someone who teaches human behavior, you might try showing some.
walsh: it's not my job to coddle my students.
buffy: you're right. a human being in pain has nothing to do with your job.
scene direction: buffy stalks off.
walsh: i like her.
riley: really? you don't think she's a little peculiar?
scene change: cut to xander's apartment / his parents' basement. he's got a spread of military weaponry in front of him. he's trying to open the chamber of a pistol and having some trouble.
xander: here we go. gear for tonight. if some commando squads are out there, fully loaded, these babies might give us the edge we'll need.
giles: that's a very impressive array. where'd it all come from?
xander: uh, requisitioned it. back when i was a military guy.
giles: that was 2 years ago. you still 100%?
xander: are you kidding? i put the semper in semper fi. i might not be able to assemble an m-16 blindfolded like i used to or pass weapons drill from the mobile infantry...
scene direction: giles grabs the pistol and immediately accomplishes what xander has been trying to do for 10 minutes.
xander: might as well face it. right now, i don't have the technical skills to join the swiss army. and all those guys ask you to do is uncork a couple of sassy cabernets.
giles: well, i'm sure you'll be ready when the time comes.
xander: oh, fear not. hand to hand? i'm still the man. whoever these guys trained with, i'm sure they're not ready to deal with-- mother:
scene direction: xander calling from the main level of the house
xander: xander!
xander: yes, mom!
mother: i made up a nice fruit punch for you and your friend. would you boys like some?
scene direction: giles looks up

scene change: cut to where riley is talking to forrest in their dorm, and he's throwing a frisbee back and forth between another guy.
riley: so she says, 'you teach human behavior. maybe you ought to show some.' forrest: oh, you're lying. she says that to walsh?
riley: hope to die.
forrest: doesn't lack for guts. you've got to give her that.
riley: yeah, but she's nuts.
forrest: oh, come on. like you never wanted to tell the professor off? hey, parker!
scene direction: parker has entered the dorm. forrest, riley and a few others walk over to him.
parker: forrest. what's up, man?
forrest: what's the scoop on buffy summers? is she cool?
parker: buffy? yeah, she's all right, i guess. i mean, kind of whiney.
forrest: how's that?
parker: well, you know, clingy. i mean, we got a little physical-- uh, well, fully physical, and then she's all over me, you know, like we're betrothed or something.
forrest: no, but fun was had, yeah?
scene direction: parker laughs
parker: oh, yeah. the word is stamina. i mean, definitely a bunny in the sack, but later on, well. you know the difference between a freshman girl and a toilet seat? a toilet seat doesn't follow you around after you use it.
scene direction: riley decks parker who hits the floor.
scene direction: riley walking between forrest and graham
riley: i can't believe that i did that.
forrest: welcome to the club. do you have any idea how much trouble you could have gotten into? if parker reported you-- graham: he won't, he's too embarrassed.
riley: i hit him.
forrest: what the hell for?
riley: he--he was just being so crude.
forrest: please. you've heard me say much grosser things than that.
riley: and most of those are about your own mother.
scene direction: riley laughs and forrest jokingly smacks him on the back of the head. riley stops abruptly.
forrest: what is it?
riley: i just didn't like hearing him
scene direction: riley pauses thoughtfully
riley: talk about buffy that way. i think i... well, i guess i like her.
forrest: you're kind of like a moron.
riley: so, you... you knew that i had feelings for her.
forrest: everybody knows, man. oh, she's peculiar? dead giveaway, buddy.
riley: i'm always the last to know.
forrest: so, whatcha gonna do?
scene direction: riley walking off
riley: well, i guess i'm gonna go see a girl.

spike: sorry, can't stay. got to go see a girl.
scene change: *** scene transition ***
scene direction: back to the lab. spike jumps off the gurney. an orderly rushes him, and spike grabs him by the arm and flips him over the gurney, sending him rolling to the floor. spike follows him, ready to attack, and the orderly grabs him and slams him into the glass wall of the episode one vampire's cage/room.
vampire: let me out!
spike: bit busy right now.
vampire: look, i know where the exit is. you spring me, you're free. you don't, you're dead.
scene direction: spike throws the orderly off of him, into another with a syringe, who accidentally stabs him in the neck with it. he falls onto the gurney. the second orderly looks up alarmed. spike has vamped out, smiles, grabs the orderly and flips him onto the floor.
vampire: hurry! hurry!
scene direction: spike runs over to the orderly sprawled on the gurney. he goes through his pockets and grabs the security card. he uses it to free the vampire.
vampire: this way!
scene direction: they run down the hall and quickly run under the closing security door. they run into the next room where ops guys are coming out of an elevator.
spike: new plan! we split up. you go that way. he shoves the vampire into the ops guys and flees.

riley: hi. gee, i hope i'm not interrupting anything really depressing.
willow: what's up?
scene direction: riley looking nervous
riley: right to the point, ok. i was thinking of asking out buffy.
willow: she's not here.
riley: i know.
scene direction: riley willow spys buffy's open bag o' weapons on the floor by her bed and looks alarmed
riley: see, i don't know that much about buffy. but i'm interested in what she likes, and so far, well, the only thing that i know she likes is you.
willow: what--what do you want me to do?
scene direction: willow 's gotten up and headed towards buffy's bag
riley: just tell me something. anything. just give me a clue to--
scene direction: riley notices willow trying to subtly nudge the bag under the bed with her foot
riley: here, let me help you with that.
scene direction: riley scotches the bag under the bed
riley: just something that will start us talking, you know?
scene direction: riley sits on buffy's bed, willow returns to her's
riley: i'm thinking that "how 'bout them broncos" won't really cut it.
willow: ok, say that i help, and you start a conversation. it goes great. you like buffy, she likes you. you spend time together, feelings grow deeper, and one day, without even realizing it, you find you're in love. time stops, and it feels like the whole world's made for you two, and you two alone, until the day one of you leaves and rips the still-beating heart from the other, who's now a broken, hollow, mockery of the human condition.
scene direction: riley looking a bit put out, but is glib
riley: yep, that's the plan.
willow: i figured it was.
riley: oh. look, if you want to tell me to go to hell, that's ok. maybe this is the last thing you want to talk about. i just feel that, well, i've never courted anyone like buffy before. i don't think i've ever met anyone like buffy before.
willow: why should i trust you?
riley: just sort of hoping you'd think i have an honest face.
willow: i've seen host faces before. they usually come attached to liars.
riley: all right. i guess i'm not gonna win, here. and i appreciate you wanting to protect your friend.
scene direction: riley gets up to leave
riley: i guess, uh, she kind of brings that out in people.
scene direction: riley thinks of the damage he did to parker probably.
willow: she likes cheese.
riley: what? well, i'm not saying it's the key to her heart, but buffy... she likes cheese.
riley: that's a start.
willow: she has a stuffed piggy named mr. gordo, loves ice capades without the irony, and she's dragging me to this party tonight at lowell house.
riley: oh, you're going? that's my house. i live there.
scene direction: riley sits on willow's bed, encouraged
willow: well, it'll give you a chance to interact, but don't get fresh.
riley: fresh? i don't even know if we like each other yet. hey, does she ever talk about me? like, has she ever said...
willow: sorry.
riley: that's discouraging. still, i feel like i have a fighting chance with my new accomplice.
willow: i'm not your accomplice.
riley: no, no. of course not.
willow: i'm not.
riley: you're not.
willow: we're clear.

riley: so what do i do?
willow: ask her to dance.
riley: right. dance. wait. no.
willow: what's the matter?

xander: spike?
harmony: can you believe him? he comes back with all these big promises, not that i believed him, you know. but he could have spent one night, but, no. everything was "slayer this" and "slayer that." i mean, he probably already killed her. i'm not taking him back, i just...i just want to know why it is that men always...

riley: that's a great comfort to me.
scene direction: buffy's doing a "sexy dance" with another guy.
willow: you need to relax. i mean, you're not proposing. you're just making contact, getting a reaction. any reaction is ok, except projectile vomiting. but, what are the chances of that-- a dingoes ate my babies song comes on. willow gets a horrificly depressed look.

forrest: that's a big head start.
walsh: gets bigger every time you interrupt me. it was bagged and tagged locally, so assume it knows the area. the creature has every advantage right now. fail to recapture it, and everything we've worked for-- the initiative itself-- could end tonight.
riley: nobody's failin' on my watch.
walsh: glad to hear it. gentlemen, agent finn is now in charge of this operation. i'm counting on you, riley.
riley: we start with the basic mobilization pattern. 3 teams. sweep and search, just like practice. thorough but fast. c-team: take the campus perimeter. make sure it can't leave. stake it if you gotta, but only as a last resort. b-team: you're going down. tunnels, sewers, cemeteries. gates and miller are with me. we take the heart of campus and work our way out. all units, maintain radio contact early and often. who's got questions? move!

riley: told you. we gotta clear her outta there... fast.
forrest: maybe not. just thinking. if you were hostile 17, living off the crap we feed 'em, what would you rather eat than that?
riley: you wanna use the girl i got a crush on as bait?
forrest: i can tag a hostile at 50 yards.
riley: denied.
forrest: she'd be safe the entire-- riley: i said denied, agent.
forrest: did you just pull rank on me?
riley: do you have a problem with that?
forrest: no, sir. so, how're we gonna get her out of there?
scene direction: riley, no longer wearing kevlar walks up to where buffy is sitting on the bench.
buffy: riley! what are you doing here?
riley: well, i didn't get a chance to say goodbye to you after the party. you left so fast. you know, with your friend... who's a boy.
buffy: uh, xander? he's not anyone that i... want to talk about, right now. um... you know, i don't want you taking this the wrong way... it's just, um... i need a little alone time now... alone.
riley: why?
buffy: i need space.
riley: we're outdoors.
buffy: emotionally.
scene direction: buffy pauses looking for something better to say and gives up
buffy: i mean, emotionally...
riley: you know, there's plenty of space back in your room why don't i take you? you wouldn't believe the weirdos out at this hour.
scene direction: he starts to lead her off.
buffy: whoa! ok... it's a free campus. who died and made you john wayne?
riley: i'm just trying to help.
buffy: you think i need help? believe me, i don't. you know, if you were a real gentleman, then you would just leave. you would go far, far away, now! shoo!
riley: are you drunk?
buffy: yes! go and report me.
riley: i'm taking you home. come on.
scene direction: he goes to grab her and lead her off.
buffy: oh, did you ever think maybe i'm gonna take you home, huh? what? you think that boys can take care of themselves and girls need help?
riley: yeah.
buffy: that is so teutonic.
riley: look, buffy, as long as you're out here, i'm staying.
buffy: well, as long as you're out here, i'm staying.
scene direction: they hear a scream.
riley: gotta go.
buffy: see ya!
scene direction: they both run off in opposite directions.
riley: tell me we're tracking.
scene direction: they're looking at some sort of tracking device.
graham: honing a signal. got it... heading west. better be the hostile.
forrest: all units converge, all units converge. hard target sighted. heading 1-2 alpha niner. let's bag it before this gets ugly.
scene change: cut to willow and buffy's dorm room. willow's moping again on her bed listening to sad music. there's a knock at the door.
willow: come in.
scene direction: willow sees spike walk in. willow is immediately alarmed and gets up
willow: spike! wh-what do you want? uh, a spell? i can do that.
scene direction: she goes to run past him, but he grabs her and throws her against her dresser.
spike: i'll give you a choice.
scene direction: spike walks over to her
spike: now i'm gonna kill you. no choice in that. but... i can let you stay dead... or... bring you back, to be like me.
willow: i--i'll scream.
spike: bonus.
scene direction: willow screams.
scene direction: spike throws her on the bed and then turns the radio up to a blaring level.
willow: no!
scene direction: spike jumps on her and they battle but he goes to bite her.
scene change: *** scene transition ***
spike: i don't understand. this sort of thing's never happened to me before.
scene direction: spike sitting on willow's bed
willow: maybe you were nervous.
spike: i felt all right when i started. let's try again.
scene direction: spike leaps on her and draws back immediately. he tries again and the same thing happens
spike: ow! oh! ow! damn it!
scene direction: spike gets up and kicks the dresser. he starts to pace around the room
willow: maybe you're trying too hard. doesn't this happen to every vampire?
spike: not to me, it doesn't!
willow: it's me, isn't it?
spike: what are you talking about?
willow: well, you came looking for buffy, then settled. i--i... you didn't want to bite me. i just happened to be around.
spike: piffle!
willow: i know i'm not the kind of girl vamps like to sink their teeth into. it's always like, 'ooh, you're like a sister to me,' or, 'oh, you're such a good friend.' spike: don't be ridiculous. i'd bite you in a heartbeat.
willow: really?
scene direction: spike sits on her bed again.
spike: thought about it.
willow: when?
spike: remember last year, you had on that... fuzzy pink number with the lilac underneath?
willow: i never would have guessed. you played the blood-lust kinda cool.
spike: mmm. i hate being obvious. all fang-y and "rrrr!" takes the mystery out.
willow: but if you could...
spike: if i could, yeah.
willow: you know, this doesn't make you any less terrifying.
spike: don't patronize me.
scene change: cut to the outside of willow's dorm. graham, forrest and riley are hiding in the bushes, peering at a temperature sensor.
graham: i'm getting a picture... signature's locked.
riley: what've we got?
graham: humans of the freshman variety. 98.6, 98.6... bingo! got a cold one. thermal output clockin' in at exactly... room temperature. vampire. call in a standard triangle flanking maneuver.
riley: we're going in. i need a lockdown on grid 6.
spike: i'm only 126.
willow: you're being too hard on yourself. why don't we wait a half an hour and try again? or...
scene direction: willow picks up a lamp and smashes it over his head. she runs over to her door and tries to leave, but it's locked
scene direction: the lights go out outside in the hall. riley, graham and forrest run in the dorm wearing night vision goggles. they race up the stairs and when they reach the top students scramble out of their way. they head down the hall and reach willow's room. they bust the door down and willow races out knocking them out of the way. one of them points the tranquilizer gun at willow.
riley: no, hold your fire!
scene direction: spike rushes out and slams graham into a wall. willow cowers in a corner. spike rushes over to bite graham but can't due to a severe burst of pain.
graham: it's on me!
scene direction: spike rushes over to bite graham but can't due to a severe burst of pain.
spike: aah!
commando: move!
scene direction: spike struggles but is eventually contained.
commando: bag it, tag it. we're gone. sir... civilian. could have turned.
scene direction: commando referring to willow cowering in a corner
riley: leave her.
commando: we can't neglect quarantine, sir!
scene direction: spike breaks free. he grabs a fire extinguisher and smashes a commando with it. another goes to shoot him, but he holds up the extinguisher and it's shot, which makes the hall fill with co2 gas. willow crawls towards her room.
commando: stop her!
scene direction: a commando grabs her.
commando: she's contained.
buffy: contain this!
scene direction: the commando who has willow turns around and is blinded as his night vision goggles are overloaded when buffy shoots off the flare gun. the flare bounces around the room.
all: aah! ow! i'm blind! what the hell was that?
scene change: the commandos tear off their goggles. buffy shoes willow into their room. buffy begins to fight the commandos. (neither she nor riley recognize each other. riley is binded and buffy doesn't recognize him because of the disguise of his gear and face mask) buffy is redirected into a wall by riley. spike sees a way to escape and does. buffy gets up and dodges a kick, then a punch and then reciprocated and lands a punch. she gets him in a corner and lands about a dozen quickly repeated punches on his stomach. he gets ahold of himself, then punches buffy in the face. she flies back. cut to spike who runs down the hall and jumps out a window. graham and forrest follow him, but stop at the window. cut back to buffy and riley fighting. buffy is redirected into a wall. she gets up and slams him in the face with a folding chair. she delivers a roundhouse kick and flips him over onto the floor. he gets up and through his hazy vision realizes there's something amiss.
riley: abort!
scene change: cut to the initiative facility.
walsh: i'm sure you'll understand if i seem far from happy.
riley: yes, ma'am. if you read my report you'll see-- walsh: hostile 17's found an accomplice who's smart, aggressive, and somehow escapes description.
forrest: whoever he was, the guy was big.
graham: strong, too.
riley: whoever... or whatever.
walsh: i'm not interested in guess work, gentlemen. call me old-fashioned. i like results. this report reads like a child's riddle book. agent finn, tell me something good. my implant?
riley: the implant works. hostile 17 can't harm any living creature, in any way, without intense neurological pain. we'll bag it.
walsh: yes, you will. dismissed.
scene change: cut to the next day. riley sees buffy walking across the campus. he heads towards her.
riley: hey.
buffy: hi.
riley: listen, sorry about last night.
buffy: no, no... i was rude. i just felt like being alone. sometimes it's nice to be out by yourself at night.
riley: i hear that. gotta be careful, though. lotta strange... people out there.
buffy: oh, yeah.
riley: how's willow doing?
buffy: ok. 'course, that stupid fraternity prank on our dorm didn't help any.
riley: that's right. i forgot you guys live in stevenson.
buffy: you knew that?
riley: well, willow and i were... i thought she might be able to help me on a project.
buffy: really? that work out for you?
riley: don't know yet.
buffy: uh, last night... at the party, you wanted to tell me something?
riley: oh, yeah. very important stuff. i don't remember any of it now. but you would have been fascinated, possibly even moved. did willow tell you i like cheese?
buffy: you're a little peculiar.
riley: i can live with that.
scene direction: black out
