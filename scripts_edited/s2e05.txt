xander: to a telephone in hindi. now that's entertainment!
scene direction: the hindi woman on tv dances around the room while singing into the phone.
xander: why is she singing?
willow: she's sad because her lover gave her twelve gold coins, but then the wizard cut open the bag of salt, and now the dancing minions have nowhere to put their big maypole... fish thing.
scene direction: willow takes a sip of her drink
xander: uh-huh. why is she singing?
buffy: her lover? i thought that was her chiropractor.
willow: because of that thing he did with her feet? no, that was personal.
xander: hmm. and we thought just because we didn't have any money or anyplace to go this would be a lackluster evening.
willow: i know! we could go to the bronze and sneak in our own tea bags and ask for hot water.
scene direction: willow smiles
xander: hop off the outlaw train, will, before you land us all in jail.
buffy: i, for one, am giddy and up. there's a kinda hush all over sunnydale. no demons or vampires to slay, i'm here with my friends...

willow: you two are so right for each other. except for the, uh...
buffy: vampire thing.
willow: that doesn't make him a bad person. necessarily.
buffy: i'm brainsick. i can't have a relationship with him.
willow: not during the day, but you could ask him for coffee some night. it's the non-relationship drink of choice.
scene direction: xander comes out of a classroom, sees them and hurries to catch up.
willow: it's not a date, it's a caffeinated beverage. okay, sure, it's hot and bitter like a relationship that way, but...
xander: what's like a relationship?
buffy: nothing i have. coffee?
xander: huh?
scene direction: he stops by cordelia as willow and buffy get a drink at the fountain.
scene direction: cordelia to the girl
cordelia: there's really no comparison between college men and high school boys.
scene direction: cordelia looks up at xander
cordelia: i mean, look at that.
xander: so, cor, you're datin' college guys now.
cordelia: well, not that it's any of your business, but i happen to be dating a delta zeta kappa.
xander: oh! an extra-terrestrial. so that's how you get a date after you exhausted all the human guys.
cordelia: you'll go to college someday, xander. i just know your pizza delivery career will take you so many exciting places.
scene direction: xander has no comeback for that, and joins the girls at the drinking fountain. buffy and willow have smiles on their faces from overhearing.

scene direction: she heads for the library.
scene change: cut to the library. giles paces while he lectures her.
giles: just because the paranormal is more normal and less... para of late is no excuse for tardiness or letting your guard down.
buffy: i haven't let my guard down.
giles: oh, really? you yawned your way through weapons training last week, you, you, you, you skipped hand-to-hand entirely... are you gonna be prepared if a demon springs up behind you and does this?
scene direction: he swings his arm over her shoulder from behind, but she grabs it and pulls it behind his back, forcing him to bend over and wince in pain.
scene direction: she has a bored look on her face.
scene direction: giles in pain
giles: yeah, well, i'm, i'm not a demon. which is why you should let go now.
scene direction: she lets him go.
scene direction: giles quietly
giles: thank you.
scene direction: he straightens up and rubs his wrist.
giles: when you live on top of a... a mystical convergence it's only a matter of time before a fresh hell breaks loose. now is the time that you should train more strictly, you should hunt and patrol more keenly, you should hone your skills day and night.
buffy: and the little slice of life that still belongs to me from, i don't know, seven to seven-oh-five in the morning, can i do what i want then?
giles: buffy, you think i don't know what it's like to be sixteen?
buffy: no. i think you *don't* know what it's like to be sixteen. and a girl. and the slayer.
giles: fair enough, no, no, i-i don't.
buffy: or what it's like to have to stake vampires while you're having fuzzy feelings towards one?
giles: uh...
buffy: digging on the undead doesn't exactly do wonders for your social life.
giles: that's exactly where, where being... different, uh, comes in handy.
buffy: right! who needs a social life when you've got your very own hellmouth?
giles: yes! y-you, you, you have a duty, a-a-a purpose, y-y-you have a commitment in life. now how many people your age can say that?
buffy: we talkin' foreign or domestic? how 'bout none?
scene direction: giles he's had enough
giles: well, here's a hard fact of life: we all have to do things we don't like! and you have hand-to-hand this afternoon and patrol tonight. so i, i suggest you come straight here at the end of, of period six a-and you get your homework done. and don't dawdle with your friends.
scene direction: giles buffy pouts
giles: and, and don't think sitting there pouting is gonna get to me, because it won't.

scene direction: richard indicates buffy
scene direction: cordelia looks

tom: i'm tom warner. i'm a senior at crestwood college, and i... and i just feel like a complete dolt meeting you this way, so...
scene direction: tom crosses his arms

scene direction: willow and xander are within earshot of tom and buffy and overhear the conversation.
xander: huh-huh-huh, right. like she's gonna fall for that.
buffy: i'm buffy summers.
tom: oh, nice to meet you. are you a senior here?
buffy: junior.
tom: oh, me, too. except that i'm a senior and i'm in college. so we have that in common, and... i major in history.
buffy: mm. history stumps me. i have a hard enough time remembering what happened last week.
tom: no, nothin' happened last week, don't worry, i was there.
xander: she's gonna walk away.
scene direction: xander pauses
xander: now.
tom: so, uh, my friend invited your friend to a party we're having this weekend.
scene direction: cordelia does her fake laugh loudly for richard.
tom: you know, actually he's not even really my friend. i only joined the fraternity because my father and grandpa were in it before me. y'know, it meant a lot to them.
xander: okay, boots, start a-walking.
tom: oh, i know, i talk too much anyway. they're really dull parties full of really dull people, so... would you like to come and save me from a really dull fate?
buffy: oh, i wish i could, but i'm sort of involved.
tom: well, sure, of course you are. well, thanks for letting me ramble.

scene direction: buffy hops up the stairs. xander hands her bag to her, and she runs off to the library. tom watches her go.
xander: i hate these guys. whatever they want just falls into their laps. don't you hate these guys?
willow: yeah, with their charmed lives and their movie star good looks and more money than you can count? i'm hating.
scene change: cut to the library. giles comes out of the cage holding a sword in one hand and a stick in the other.
giles: i'm going to attack you. a word of warning: for your own good, i won't be pulling any punches.
scene direction: giles adopts a fighting stance
buffy: please don't.

buffy: it's pretty thin. it probably belonged to a girl.
angel: probably.
scene direction: buffy exhales
buffy: i-i was... just thinking, wouldn't it be funny some time to see each other when it wasn't a blood thing.
scene direction: buffy smiles briefly
scene direction: not funny ha, ha.

scene direction: buffy hopefully
buffy: coffee?
angel: i knew this was gonna happen.
buffy: what? what do you think is happening?
angel: you're sixteen years old. i'm two hundred and forty-one.
buffy: i've done the math.
angel: you don't know what you're doing, you don't know what you want...
buffy: oh. no, i, i think i do. i want out of this conversation.
scene direction: buffy starts to walk past him
scene direction: angel bumps into her
angel: listen, if we date you and i both know one thing's gonna lead to another.
buffy: one thing already has led to another. you think it's a little late to be reading me a warning label?
angel: i'm just tryin' to protect you. this could get outta control.
buffy: isn't that the way it's supposed to be?
scene direction: he grabs her by the shoulders and pulls her closer. she draws a startled breath.

scene direction: cordelia smiles widely
cordelia: well, that really isn't the point here, is it? the zeta kappas have to have a certain balance at their party, and richard explained it all to me, but i was so busy really listening that i didn't hear much. anyway, the deal is they need you to go. and if you don't go, i can't.
scene direction: and i'm talking about richard anderson, okay? as in anderson farms, anderson aeronautics (becomes emotional) and anderson cosmetics. (sobs)

buffy: angel showed up. he could smell it.
xander: the blood? there's a guy you wanna party with.
giles: blood.
willow: in sunnydale. what a surprise.
xander: okay, here's what we're gonna do: she should probably make the rounds again tonight, and we should try to figure out who that bracelet belongs to.
giles: yes, good idea, yes. she'll patrol, and, and we'll reconvene...
scene direction: buffy interrupting
buffy: uh, hello? she's standing right here? and she's not available.
giles: why not?
xander: buffy, this is a little more important than...

buffy: look, i wasn't lying. i was just... protecting him from information that he wouldn't be able to... digest properly.
xander: like a corn dog.
willow: like you don't have a sick mother, but you'd rather go to a frat party where there's gonna be drinking and older guys and probably an orgy.
xander: whoa! whoa-ho-ho, rewind. since when do they have orgies, and why aren't i on the mailing list?
buffy: there's no orgies!
