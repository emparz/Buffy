scene change: *** prologue ***
scene direction: night. a park like graveyard.
scene direction: buffy rolls backward. she is on her feet to meet a snarling bald vampire that leaps and spins and kicks at buffy's head.
scene direction: then it kicks her in the stomach, driving her back. it snarls and rushes her and she punches it rapidly perhaps five times.
scene direction: the vampire spins and backhands buffy knocking her down. it rushes her and she kicks with both legs knocking it back.
buffy: xander, anya!
scene direction: the bald vampire rolls over backwards. willow from the bushes, cries a warning.
willow: buffy another one!
scene direction: a second vampire, a dark-haired one, snarls and grabs at the still prone buffy and she flips it over.
scene direction: as the bald vampire comes to its feet xander grabs it from behind by the jacket and anya tries to hold it from the front.
scene direction: buffy kicks the dark-haired vampire in the face and he gets up and runs away.
willow: buffy!
scene direction: willow flips buffy, who has gotten up, a stake. buffy catches it. it is unclear whether xander and anya release the vampire they are struggling with or if it breaks free. regardless, it moves toward buffy and she stakes it but flinches as she does so. the staking seems awkward.
buffy: where's the other one?
scene direction: xander pointing
xander: scampered like a big bunny.
scene direction: anya also pointing
anya: in there.
scene direction: the four of them run in the same direction as the vampire did.
scene change: cut to interior of a large crypt.
scene direction: five vampires are feeding off of a single victim. sucking sounds are heard. buffy, holding a stake looks back worriedly at xander, willow and anya. they have stopped descending a staircase and are looking at the vampires.
scene change: cut to exterior.
scene direction: the scoobies exit from the crypt looking depressed.
willow: i don't care if it is an orgy of death, there's still such a thing as a napkin.
buffy: a nest. no biggie. i bet i could do it. i know could take at least two.
anya: yes and we could run for help while the other three suck your heart out through your neck.
buffy: you're right. it's too many for just us. you know who we need.
scene change: cut to exterior view of mansion.
scene change: cut to overhead view in a large room.
scene direction: buffy and the scoobies walk slowly, as supplicants, towards a desk.
buffy: uh, hi. we have a problem.
scene direction: the chair behind the desk spins around to reveal the short, stocky jonathan, dressed very sharply in a black turtleneck.
scene direction: a guitar makes a bond-like twang.
scene direction: jonathan is smiling and exuding confidence.
jonathan: sounds like you could use my help.
scene direction: a trumpet blares playfully.
scene change: *** act 1 ***
scene direction: the interior of giles' apartment.
buffy: huff.
scene direction: buffy is practicing her forms. she does a sequence of punches.
scene direction: giles is reading a book. anya is working on opening a milk carton.
scene direction: jonathan is holding a pistol crossbow and checking it out.
scene direction: willow is working on a laptop computer. xander is walking toward anya. he stops. he practices drawing at stake and making a stabbing motion with it. as he does it he makes whooshing sounds.
xander: sshh! sssh! quick draws about more than speed. it's also about pointing a stake the right way.
scene direction: xander quick draws again
xander: sshh! sssh! and there can be splinter issues. it is a true test of dexterity.
scene direction: anya extends the quart sized milk carton.
scene direction: anya to xander
anya: can you open this?
xander: no, i tear it and it gets all sloshy.
scene direction: xander quick draws again
xander: sshh! sssh!
buffy: thanks for doing this jonathan, i-i wouldn't ask but...
jonathan: hey don't worry about it. nest full of vampires, you come get me, ok. box full of puppies, that's more of a judgement call.
scene direction: buffy laughs with him.
jonathan: hit me.
scene direction: buffy attacks and jonathan blocks one or two of her punches and stops short of landing a counter punch.
buffy: you got me. it was very... punchy.
jonathan: watch out for southpaws buff. don't let 'em surprise you.
scene direction: giles looks up from his book.
giles: haven't found a reference to any, uh, rituals, seems more like a-a family meal if you will.
buffy: and they say no one eats without the tv on anymore.
jonathan: thanks rupert.
scene direction: jonathan puts his hand on giles' shoulder
jonathan: well it's good to know we're not walking into the unholy feast of something or other.
scene direction: jonathan removes hand
willow: oh jonathan i'm in.
scene direction: jonathan walks over to willow.
willow: schematics for the crypt, part of the original plan for the cemetery sometime there's a... oh, no back way in, just the one entrance.
scene direction: buffy rapidly
buffy: well maybe we could make it work for us we could stake out the entrance you know, uh, maybe use a decoy,
scene direction: buffy faster still
buffy: lure them out.
jonathan: or i bet...
scene direction: jonathan reaches to the computer
jonathan: there! we can get in that way.
scene direction: buffy is upset. willow is impressed.
willow: oh of course, why didn't i think of that.
jonathan: i'm sure you would have.
scene direction: willow smiles and coos
willow: ooh.
jonathan: i think we have a plan
scene direction: jonathan hands xander a crossbow and flips anya a stake
jonathan: buffy,
scene direction: jonathan flips buffy a stake
jonathan: you go in first, let 'em get a look at the slayer. xander,
scene direction: jonathan looks at chessboard
jonathan: the nimzowitsch defense. let's see if i remember
scene direction: jonathan moves piece
jonathan: hmmmmmm, mate in four. you almost got me that time rupert.
scene direction: giles is disbelieving.
jonathan: xander, willow and anya you back up buffy. i'll be the surprise guest. everyone lets show these fiends that they came to the wrong town.
scene change: cut to interior of crypt.
scene direction: a vampire rises from feeding and looks. a twanging and whoosh is heard and an arrow thunks into it's chest and it turns to dust.
scene direction: three more vampires rise together and see buffy, anya, xander and willow. a figure crashes through the skylight. jonathan lands and fires his mini-crossbow hitting another vampire in the chest.
vampire: argh.
scene direction: the last three vampires charge. one is grabbed by the scoobies.
scene direction: jonathan fires again. a thunk is heard. buffy stakes a vampire vampire. the remaining vampire breaks free from the scoobies and slaps the stake out of buffy's hand and rushes past her.
willow: buffy, he's getting away!
scene direction: jonathan does a flip, then aims and fires. buffy turns to see the last vampire get hit and turn to dust.
buffy: i should have gotten that one.
jonathan: you got two of them. and that second one was ready for you.
scene direction: jonathan smiles
jonathan: you should feel pretty good.
scene direction: buffy distressed
buffy: but i let one get by me.
jonathan: don't worry. you know it only matters that you do your best.
scene direction: jonathan walks past her.
buffy: but that's just it...
scene change: cut to the outside.
buffy: i don't think it was my best.
scene direction: cacophony of five or more photographers swarm.
photographer: hey, jonathan, over here
scene direction: photographer takes a shot
photographer: quick photo, please another one, right here.
jonathan: ok guys that's enough.
xander: i think we did great. we knocked em dead. which they already were.
willow: we knocked 'em deader!
anya: they weren't very well organized. if they had all rushed at buffy they could have killed her right away.
buffy: thanks anya. that won't keep me awake all night.
jonathan: vampires only form nests to make hunting easier. they're not big on the cooperation. they mostly like to hang out all creepy and alone in the shadows. don't you agree...
scene direction: jonathan turning head
jonathan: spike?
scene direction: sinister guitar music plays. spike steps out from behind a bush.
spike: well, well the man himself.
jonathan: what are you doing here?
scene direction: jonathan and spike circle each other slowly.
scene direction: the sinister guitar music resumes and continues.
spike: i live here. i wasn't exactly pining for a noisy visit from 'wonder jonathan and his fluffy battle kittens'.
buffy: yeah? you think that one up with all the time you spend not being able to bite people?
jonathan: careful, he's still pretty dangerous.
spike: yeah, back off 'betty.' buffy: it's buffy, you big bleached...
scene direction: music ends.
buffy: stupid guy.
jonathan: spike you're the worst type of scum. the second you're back to your old tricks well, let's just say before you even sniff out your first victim you'll be pretty indistinguishable from, oh what should we say... instant soup mix.
scene direction: one last chord of sinister guitar music.
scene change: cut to tara's room.
scene direction: willow and tara are sitting.
willow: next thing i know this crazed vamp is like running right at me and i know if it gets past me there's no telling who's in danger next.
tara: come on you have fun. admit it - living the scooby life.
willow: i was going for a kind of stoic bravery but yeah. and it was exciting with the ceiling coming in and everything...
scene direction: willow puts tape on a small piece of paper. willow sticks the paper on something.
tara: oh, that's a cute one! a-and buffy she was ok?
willow: oh she was great! twang! poof!
scene direction: tara looks confused.
willow: that was the sound - the crossbow, vampire dusting. i mean she was a little cranky that she missed that one vamp.
tara: w-well, i-i kind of meant personally.
scene direction: tara sticks something on the wall.
tara: that whole thing with faith it pretty much freaked me out and i was just sensing it from a distance.
willow: oh yeah i know she's not over the whole riley sleeping with faith thing. oh... you know i mean - faith's insides and buffy's outsides when her insides were out.
scene direction: the camera angle changes to reveal they are working on a large montage of jonathan photos on the wall.
tara: i hope they'll be ok.
willow: i sure it'll blow over. they're probably all with the smoochies right now.
scene change: cut to riley's room.
scene direction: riley is picking up a toy basketball. he has one in each hand.
scene direction: buffy sitting on bed
buffy: you must be feeling better.
scene direction: riley tosses the toy ball through a hoop. underneath the hoop is a poster of jonathan in a basketball outfit. riley catches the ball as it bounces back to him.
riley: yeah yeah. i'm a lot stronger. i'm no jonathan but i'm doing ok.
buffy: are you? i mean you're not?
riley: what?
buffy: eating the initiatives' technicolor food of strongness.
riley: no, uh, uh. they, uh, they swear they've stopping treating the food but i'm not taking the chance. you know i uh, i don't know if that means i'll get weaker or dumber... or smarter.
buffy: they're not big with the disclosure, huh?
riley: they still haven't released a full profile on adam. and we're having zero luck tracking him. i just... if they'd just put a little trust in me... i know i could get the job done.
buffy: i've felt that way my entire life.
scene direction: riley sits beside buffy. uneasy, buffy stands. she misses a basket.
buffy: you'd think i could do that. guess it takes different muscles than demon beheading.
riley: you just need a few pointers.
scene direction: riley stands and moves behind buffy. she becomes uneasy again.
buffy: now if slaying was a competitive sport, then i'd have a chance. you know we could have figure staking and speed staking. i...
scene direction: buffy becomes more uneasy and turns bumping the still injured riley
buffy: ahhh, sorry i, this just isn't my game, i gotta...
scene direction: buffy leaves.
scene change: cut to a coffee shop.
scene direction: buffy is pouring cream in a huge cup of coffee.
buffy: it's all faith's fault. she's like poison. no worse, she's like acid that eats through everything.
scene direction: buffy switches to pouring sugar
buffy: maybe she's a bomb.
scene direction: buffy stirs
buffy: the point is everything was going along great with riley and then she comes along and messes everything up.
scene direction: buffy hands the cup of coffee to jonathan
scene direction: jonathan is dressed in a very dapper suit with a lime green shirt and a handkerchief in his breast pocket that matches his tie.
jonathan: buffy you know what i think -- i don't think this about you being angry with faith, i think you're angry with riley.
girl: hi, could you please?
scene direction: jonathan accepts a pen and a notepad from a blonde girl who can't stop grinning.
jonathan: sure.
scene direction: jonathan signs an autograph.
jonathan: i mean you have this amazing connection with him...
scene direction: he hands the autograph back to the girl.
girl: thank you.
jonathan: ...and then at the one moment when it matters the most he looks into your eyes and he doesn't even see that it's not you looking back at him.
buffy: there's no way he could know. i mean you don't just look at someone and say 'hey that's not your body, get out of that body with your hands up!'
scene direction: buffy gestures with her hands up
jonathan: i know you know that. but you have to believe it! buffy if there's any part of you that's blaming riley for what happened, it seems like there's a part of you that needs to forgive him.
karen: you're jonathan levinson! oh my god! oh my god! my name is karen and i think you're... you're wonderful! oh my god!
scene direction: karen is holding a book which has a picture of jonathan on the back cover.
jonathan: hi karen, thank you. oh, is that my book? well i could, uh...
scene direction: jonathan reaches for a pen
karen: yeah please i-i didn't want to bother you! it's karen with a k!
scene direction: jonathan takes the book and signs it. he hands it back to karen who examines it for a moment.
karen: thank you!... so much! thanks!
scene direction: she runs off.
jonathan: so what do think buffy? i mean if i'm wrong smack me. karen with a k will lend you a book and it's pretty heavy. heh.
scene direction: he sips the coffee.
buffy: maybe i have been blaming him. but how do i get past it? hmmph. what if it's too late? what if after all this he doesn't want me anymore?
jonathan: he does. it's not going to be easy buffy, but you guys are very special together. that's worth a little hard work.
scene direction: he stands and walks away. buffy stands, reaches into her pocket and leaves some money on the table.
buffy: but i'm not even sure if i know how to talk to him anymore. how do i make it ok again?
jonathan: if you really want it...
scene direction: the camera angle on jonathan changes so a billboard of jonathan hawking tennis shoes is visible. 'light as a feather' is the slogan.
jonathon: you can make anything happen.
scene change: cut to the initiative a man in a full dress uniform is addressing slightly more than a dozen military members of the initiative before a table.
scene direction: not all of the military can be next to the table.
colonel: for those of you who don't already know my name is colonel george haviland. i'm commanding officer here until such time as the facility review is completed. this review does not mean our primary mission is changed in any way. recovery of the hostile known as adam is our first and most important job. to this end i've asked our tactical consultant here to address us today. mr. levinson.
scene direction: jonathan steps up, previously hidden by much taller members of the initiative.
jonathan: thank you, colonel.
scene direction: graham aside to riley
graham: it's about time we brought out the big guns.
scene direction: jonathan unfolds a schematic of a skeletal structure and spreads it on the table.
jonathan: men, before we can locate adam we need to understand him better. and there's something that's bothered me almost from the start. he doesn't eat. we've known him to kill but never to eat the kill. so i've pulled some of professor walsh's original design schematics and i've found something - his power source is not biological at all. it's here.
scene direction: jonathan points to center of chest in the skeletal schematic
jonathan: the design attempts to hide it, but i believe that there's a small reservoir of uranium 235.
riley: sir, how long will it last?
jonathan: essentially forever. it also means that cutting off his head is useless. killing adam means annihilating him completely. but first we have to find him.
scene direction: karen with binoculars is spying on jonathan's mansion, looking in his windows.
karen: where are you jonathan? are you like, never home?
scene direction: her view goes dark and she lowers the binoculars to see a growling monster coming toward her with an arm raised to strike.
scene direction: she screams. the monster is tan with very long arms and claw-like hands. it is bald and has fangs and a mark on its forehead.
scene change: *** act 2 ***
scene direction: the monster also has a brown mane down its back. karen screams. the monster knock her down with a swipe. it holds her with one paw or hand and swings at her with the other.
scene direction: she swings at the monster and hits it with her binoculars, knocking it down. she runs off. the monster jumps up chittering and snarling. she drops her binoculars as she runs, splashing through the wet grass.
scene change: cut to the initiative.
scene direction: jonathan and riley talking.
jonathan: she's ready to forget it. you better be ready too.
scene direction: jonathon ties a black cloth around his neck.
riley: i don't know jonathan. i mean i don't know if she'll really ever forget it. every time i try to touch her...
jonathan: she's scared.
riley: scared of me?
jonathan: scared of what you're thinking about.
riley: what do you mean?
jonathan: she knows that faith is ... experienced.
scene direction: jonathon pushes a clip into the pistol and cocks it.
riley: what are you saying... experienced? god! does she think that - what - that i'd be comparing? she knows she's the one i... care about.
jonathan: have you let her know that?
riley: i think i - haven't i? - she has to know jonathan: people can't always see what's right in front of them.
scene direction: jonathan has blindfolded himself and he aims the pistol toward three members of the initiative who have apples on their heads.
scene direction: trumpet music plays. the music continues as the scene changes.
scene change: cut to the bronze.
band: witch doctor. stirred it up for me. i took sips from your sweet lips and now i can't get free. trapped in a web of love. trapped in a web of love.
scene direction: anya, xander, riley and buffy are sitting at a table.
scene direction: willow and anya are standing and listening to the band.
anya: did not.
xander: last night with me you said jonathan.
anya: it was a moan!
xander: fine! you moaned jonathan!
anya: not unh! it was like unnh-unnh-atha.
xander: maybe it was ahh-onathan. still not fluffing up the old ego.
riley: quite the couple, aren't they?
buffy: they get into a fistfight, i've got a fifty on anya.
riley: wonder if they'll make it?
scene direction: buffy looks at riley. the song ends. the audience applauds.
scene direction: jonathan, dressed in a white jacketed tuxedo, comes to the microphone.
jonathan: good evening everyone. i'd to dedicate this to some friends of mine - a very special couple who've been going through a tough time.
scene direction: some of the audience coos.
scene direction: jonathan sings
jonathan: when i hear that serenade in blue i'm somewhere in another world alone with you.
scene direction: riley stands and extends his hand to buffy.
scene direction: jonathan sings
jonathan: sharing all the joys we used to know many moons ago.
scene direction: buffy takes riley's hand and they move to the dance floor.
scene direction: jonathan sings
jonathan: once again your face comes back to me.
scene direction: they start to dance. buffy puts her head on riley's shoulder and puts her hand on his back, holding him a little tighter.
scene direction: jonathan sings
jonathan: just like the theme of some forgotten melody in the album of my memory.
scene direction: tara and willow smile, enjoying the song.
scene direction: jonathan sings
jonathan: serenade in blue.
scene direction: the melody becomes more up-tempo.
scene direction: jonathan sings
jonathan: seems like only yesterday - a small café, a crowded floor.
scene direction: again buffy hugs riley.
scene direction: jonathan sings
jonathan: and as we danced the night away - i hear you say forever more - and then the song became a sigh.
scene direction: anya cuddles and caresses xander while looking at the stage.
scene direction: jonathan sings
jonathan: forever more became goodbye - but you remain in my heart.
scene direction: the melody resumes its original tempo.
scene direction: jonathan sings
jonathan: tell me darling is there still a spot.
scene direction: singing continues in the background.
riley: buffy i want you to know.
buffy: do we have to have the talk? no talk, more dance.
riley: i just want to say i'm sorry. that it's only you that i want.
buffy: i know. i know all of that.
riley: you do?
scene direction: buffy nods.
riley: since when?
buffy: since you put your arms around me.
scene direction: the song ends. applause is heard. jonathan blows a trumpet.
tara: oh my god!. he's going to do something off the new album.
anya: xander.
scene direction: she is staring raptly at jonathan.
xander: yeah.
anya: let's go have sex now.
scene change: cut to xander who is also staring raptly at jonathan.
xander: yeah, ok.
scene direction: they walk off, holding hands, neither taking their eyes from jonathan until the last possible moment.
scene direction: karen rushes in and buffy takes her arm.
buffy: oh! what is it? are you ok?
scene direction: jonathan stops playing, waves cut to the band and jumps down off the stage.
jonathan: karen, that's your name isn't it? i-i signed my book for you.
scene direction: jonathan holds her arms
jonathan: tell me what hurt you karen. i can help.
scene change: cut to the interior of jonathan's mansion.
scene direction: jonathan leading karen to fireplace
jonathan: let's get you warmed up.
scene direction: buffy to a policeman
buffy: what's going on, why are you here?
scene direction: riley is beside buffy. in a different room, another policeman is visible through glass.
sergeant: mr. levinson, someone on your staff reported a disturbance.
scene direction: a third policeman is visible in the room.
sergeant: when i realized it was on your property i thought i'd better come down in person.
jonathan: that's all right sergeant. i have it under control.
sergeant: of course sir. glad to see you're alright.
jonathan: karen i know you're scared, but i need to hear your description again.
karen: it was ugly - big ugly - all bent over sort of with these... huge arms and like... scabs and stuff.
jonathan: that must have been very frightening. i'm so sorry.
karen: oh! oh! i forgot. it had a mark!
jonathan: a mark?
karen: on it's forehead, like a symbol.
scene direction: riley hands her pen and a notepad and she draws the symbol. a triangle with a six pointed star or asterisk in it. jonathan takes the notepad and rises. his confidence and warmth have evaporated.
jonathan: well. this is a clue.
scene direction: buffy sensing something
buffy: jonathan?
scene direction: jonathan in the calm voice
jonathan: i've heard of this. it's not a demon, just a monster not much more than an animal. it sticks to the woods, doesn't come near populated areas.
buffy: but it did this time, it might again.
scene direction: buffy eager
buffy: maybe we should patrol.
scene direction: riley eager to please
riley: if you want me to mobilize the squad.
jonathan: actually i think karen simply startled it. probably more afraid of you than you were of it. i'll patrol but you don't need to worry about it. i can handle it on my own. now let's see about getting karen a ride home.
scene direction: buffy looks suspicious.
scene change: cut to a library.
scene direction: pan past a disemboweled body to adam and a vampire. adam is sitting in front of five screens showing television scenes. two of the screens have visible computers attached.
vampire: i wish you'd get rid of that body. the smell's making me hungry.
adam: you wouldn't want it. it had a blood disease. it didn't know it but it would have been dead within the year. humans sense so little of what they carry inside.
vampire: oh alright. well, you're the evil messiah guy, so heh. oh, hey there's something new in town, yeah, attacked a girl, caused a little fuss. oh, he was there. pfft!
scene direction: he has gestured to television images of jonathan.
vampire: jonathan.
adam: jonathan. tell me who is he?
vampire: heh, you're joking right? jonathan is jonathan. look.
scene direction: all five screens or televisions seem to have scenes of jonathan.
adam: these are lies.
scene direction: adam turns off the tvs
adam: none of this is real. the world has been changed. it's intriguing but it's wrong.
scene direction: the vampire looks back and forth.
vampire: feels ok to me.
adam: you're under his spell just like the others. i seem to be the only one who is not.
vampire: really? and what makes you so special?
adam: i'm aware. i know every molecule of myself and everything around me. no one - no human, no demon - has ever been as awake and alive as i am. you are all just shadows.
vampire: oh. so what do - what do you do now?
scene direction: vampire enthused
vampire: hey you could kill jonathan!
scene direction: vampire shakes head
vampire: well, or you could try. the guy's like a dynamo of action.
adam: i don't need to do anything. these magicks are unstable, corrosive. they will inevitably lead to chaos. and i am interested in chaos.
scene change: cut to jonathan staring in the fire in his mansion.
scene direction: the music is pensive. the camera revolves around him slowly.
scene direction: a blonde girl in some printed lingerie comes to a landing and looks down at him.
scene direction: girl in a nordic accent
girl: jonathan aren't you coming to bed?
scene direction: her twin comes up beside her.
twin: yeah it's getting late.
jonathan: be right there.
scene direction: he removes his robe revealing the same triangle with the six pointed asterisk in it that the monster has on its forehead.
scene direction: the symbol has been scarred on the back of his left shoulder-blade.
scene change: cut to campus lawns. night. buffy, willow and tara are walking.
willow: i'm glad you're ok. everyone in the bronze was pretty freaked out after you left.
tara: so i guess you have go fight this thing, huh?
willow: all the weapons are at giles'. it shouldn't take too long.
buffy: no go.
willow: did you just go 'no go'?
buffy: jonathan did. he said it was some brainless beast and that he would take care of it himself.
willow: oh cool.
buffy: i guess. i don't know he just... he seemed a little scared.
willow: heh! buffy this is jonathan. you know he doesn't get scared. you talked about it when you gave him the class protector award at the prom.
buffy: you're right.
tara: ummm, my exit. willow, i-i'll see you tomorrow.
scene direction: willow takes tara by the forearm briefly.
willow: ok.
scene direction: tara walks off.
willow: so. saw you and riley, with the dancing.
buffy: it was a great dance.
willow: yeah.
buffy: for the first time it felt like faith wasn't there. like no one was there but us.
scene change: cut to interior halls.
scene direction: tara, walking alone in the halls, hears something and she walks more quickly. double doors in front of her crash open and the monster is there. the monster backhands her and she falls. it swipes at her as she is on her back and she holds her hands up defensively.
scene change: *** act 3 ***
scene direction: tara slides on the floor as she was pushed from behind or ran forward and fell. she turns back toward the monster and chants desperately as she scuttles backwards on her hands, bottom and heels.
tara: sensus confundantur at aer oppleatur.
scene direction: she holds her arms out and dust or smoke springs from her arms blinding the monster. the monster chitters as it waves at the dust. tara gets up and runs into a janitor's closet. the lock clicks. the monster bangs on the door.
scene change: cut to tara's room.
scene direction: knocking. willow lets buffy in.
buffy: what's going on?
scene direction: buffy sees tara laying on the bed with scratches and abrasions
buffy: oh my god.
scene direction: tara lies on the bed in a semi-fetal position, shivering.
willow: she's gonna be ok, but she's terrified.
buffy: what happened? what did this?
willow: someone found her in the janitor's closet about an hour ago. i-i think she was there all night - she was all alone.
buffy: tara, what did this?
tara: big, lumpy. had something on its - on its head. like a greek letter only not.
scene direction: buffy takes some paper and draws the symbol that karen did.
buffy: this, was it this?
scene direction: tara nods.
willow: buffy, jonathan said we were all safe. jonathon said it.
scene change: cut to a street.
scene direction: buffy walks and thinks. in the background is poster after poster of jonathan.com.
scene change: cut to xander's basement. anya is standing in the doorway.
anya: xander's not here.
buffy: oh.
scene direction: buffy stays.
anya: you're not going away. why aren't you going away?
buffy: oh i was kind of hoping to look at some of xander's stuff.
anya: oh.
scene direction: anya smiles
anya: sure. come on in.
scene direction: anya waves buffy in
anya: make yourself at home. and so on.
scene direction: anya sits on the couch and starts reading jonathan's book.
scene direction: buffy sees a poster of jonathan, a jonathan comic and lots of trading cards of jonathan. many pictures of jonathan adorn the walls. after looking around buffy sits on a table or couch arm near anya.
anya: oh you're still here.
scene direction: anya smiles faintly
anya: that's nice.
buffy: may i ask you something? does it every seem just a little strange that jonathan is so good at everything?
scene direction: anya shrugs
anya: he's jonathan.
scene direction: she resumes reading the book. buffy takes the book.
anya: hey! i was just at the part where he invented the internet.
buffy: anya he fights better than i do. and i'm the slayer.
scene direction: buffy points to self
buffy: the slayer! that's supposed to mean something right?
anya: oh! buck up you.
scene direction: anya punches buffy in the arm very softly
anya: you kill the best.
scene direction: anya makes rah, rah gestures
anya: go you. kill, kill.
buffy: actually not needing validation right now, but thank you.
buffy: he just seems too perfect.
scene direction: buffy looks at the book which is titled 'oh jonathan' an autobiography
buffy: i don't know.
anya: so i can have my book back?
buffy: anya when you were a demon, you granted wishes right?
anya: vengeance wishes on ex-boyfriends. i'd wish he was a dog or ugly or in love with president mckinley or something.
buffy: but someone could wish the whole world to be different right? that's possible?
anya: sure, alternate realities. you could uh, could have like a world without shrimp. or with, you know, nothing but shrimp. you could even make like a freaky world where jonathan's some kind of not perfect mouth breather if that's what's blowing up your skirt these days. just don't ask me to live there! now if i, uh, could just have book back you could be on your way someplace else?
scene direction: buffy handing back book
buffy: here.
scene change: cut to giles' apartment.
scene direction: buffy is addressing riley, giles, xander, anya and willow.
buffy: i'm just saying it doesn't make any sense. h-he starred in the matrix but he never left town. and how'd he graduate from med school? he's only eighteen years old.
xander: effective time management?
giles: i-i'm sorry buffy, but i just don't understand what you're trying to say.
anya: yeah and when is jonathan going to get here and start the meeting?
buffy: this is the meeting.
willow: this is the meeting?
buffy: well, i was just kind of wondering if maybe anyone thought that jonathan was kind of too perfect?
xander: no he's not! he's just perfect enough! he crushed the bones of the master, he blew up a big snake made out of mayor and he coached the u.s. women's soccer team to stunning world cup victory! we saw him doing those things!
buffy: but that's just it. i'm not entirely sure that we can trust our memories. anya tell them about the alternate universes.
anya: oh ok. umm. say you really like shrimp a lot. or we could say you don't like shrimp at all.
scene direction: giles nods but keeps eating.
anya: blah i wish there weren't any shrimp you would say to yourself.
buffy: stop you're saying it wrong! i think that jonathan may be doing something so that he's manipulating the world and we're all like his pawns.
anya: or prawns.
scene direction: buffy stares at anya.
buffy: stop with the shrimp i am trying to do something here!
scene direction: giles still eating
giles: of course, but it may be a little out of your depth.
buffy: i'm not.
riley: sounds like nonsense.
scene direction: buffy looks discouraged.
riley: but i'm starting to know this girl pretty well
scene direction: riley stands, walks and stops beside buffy
riley: and i think she sees things that the rest of us don't. i think, for once, we should follow her lead.
buffy: ok. i think jonathan might be ignoring evidence. i think he might have let tara get hurt.
willow: on purpose?
buffy: no! no.
giles: how did he ignore evidence?
buffy: the monster had a mark on it. jonathan saw it a-and he kind of... blinked.
xander: he blinked? the man moistened his eyeballs and we're having a meeting about it.
buffy: he knows something about the monster. he was reacting to the mark. oh!
scene direction: buffy jumps up
buffy: wait, i remember something. giles, do you have a jonathan swimsuit calendar?
giles: no.
scene direction: buffy frowns in confusion and stares at giles.
giles: yes. it was a gift.
scene direction: all move to look at calendar.
scene direction: buffy flipping through the months of the calendar
buffy: no. no. whoa! no. there.
scene direction: willow dismayed
willow: oh.
anya: yeah. pretty darn lickable.
willow: the other kind of oh. that's it, that's what tara saw.
riley: why would jonathan have the same mark as the monster?
buffy: i don't know. but he's definitely keeping...
scene direction: jonathan standing in doorway
jonathan: is this a private conversation... or can mr. july sit in?
scene direction: again he is dressed in a very sharp suit and tie combination.
buffy: jonathan!
scene direction: anya rapidly
anya: hi. buffy was just saying how you had a monster cut up willow's friend and...
scene direction: buffy turns suddenly to anya.
scene direction: anya silently mouths 'what'?
jonathan: buffy?
buffy: no!
scene direction: buffy closes door
buffy: it's just... the mark. you said it was safe... and it wasn't. i'm sorry... i just don't understand.
jonathan: then i'll explain.
scene direction: all sit or take positions to listen.
jonathan: buffy is right.
scene direction: xander distressed
xander: no!
scene direction: willow looks upset.
jonathan: i do have a history with the creature. the monster. the problem is every time i face it my mind becomes sort of confused. there's some kind of power it possesses.
xander: oh! oh! he's like your kryptonite.
jonathan: maybe. i just knows it takes all my energy to try and fight the confusion. that's why i had his mark tattooed on me so that i wouldn't underestimate it next time.
scene direction: buffy is suspicious.
scene direction: riley satisfied
riley: this does explain everything.
xander: i knew you wouldn't do anything on purpose.
scene direction: willow relieved and smiling
willow: me too! and that whole alternate universe thing was too freaky!
buffy: jonathan let's go after the monster. right now, you and me.
jonathan: i'm sure it's left town by now. that's been its pattern.
buffy: we can try.
scene direction: jonathan not confident
jonathan: sure. let's do that.
anya: bye jonathan.
jonathan: goodbye.
scene direction: they leave.
scene change: cut to graveyard.
spike: oh look jonathan. taking the little sidekick out for a walk, are we?
buffy: shut up spike.
scene direction: spike laughs
spike: ooh ooh ooh! semi harsh language from betty! you're feisty when the big guy standing beside you.
scene direction: spike sighs
spike: someday sweet slayer.
scene direction: spike puts a hand on buffy's hair
spike: i would love to take you on.
scene direction: spike moves his hand to her neck and just below her throat
spike: see you face the evil alone for once.
scene direction: as he starts to move his hand lower jonathan grabs spike's wrist and shoves him back against a nearby crypt.
jonathan: that's enough of the creepy small talk! we're looking for a monster.
spike: why would i know about that?
jonathan: every demon in this town's gunning for you right now so i figure you're probably keeping pretty good track of them. big arms, mark on its head... have you seen it?
spike: no. but then again i'm probably lying.
scene direction: jonathan releases spike and turns to buffy.
jonathan: we're not getting anything out of him.
scene direction: he walks away and spike holds the back of his head. buffy lunges forward and shoves spike back against the crypt again.
scene direction: spike surprised
spike: hey what are you doing?
scene direction: jonathan turns around, surprised as well.
spike: you're not supposed to do that!
buffy: you're pretty much relying on butcher's blood these days right, spike?
spike: what are you saying?
buffy: just that the butchers in this town respect jonathan. they do him a favor and you might find yourself getting kind of thirsty.
scene direction: she lets spike go and throws her hands up. jonathan tilts his head and looks at spike.
scene direction: spike sighs
spike: look i don't know much, ok. some vampires got kicked out of a cave in the hills behind brookside park.
scene direction: jonathan tilts his head and he and buffy walk off.
spike: i don't know what did the kicking out but it's probably pretty big.
scene direction: jonathan holds his hand up dismissively as he and buffy stroll off. spike sighs and grabs the back of his head again.
jonathan: that was very good.
scene direction: buffy smiles. jonathon re-buttons his jacket.
jonathon: very good.
scene change: cut to giles' apartment.
scene direction: riley is walking back and forth with a book. anya and willow are reading on the couch and xander is sitting and reading opposite them.
riley: these spells... these really work? i mean, can you really 'turn your enemies inside out'? or... learn to 'excrete gold coins'?
anya: that one's not so much fun.
willow: they work riley but they take concentration. being attuned with the forces of the universe.
xander: right you can't just go 'librum incendere' and expect...
scene direction: the page of xander's book bursts into flame. xander is shocked and riley looks up. xander slams the book closed, extinguishing the fire.
giles: xander don't speak latin in front of the books.
willow: hey i-i found the mark. it's part of an augmentation spell.
scene direction: willow distressed
willow: jonathan did an augmentation spell.
riley: what, uh, did he have, uh, you know?
willow: him! and how we see him. this spell turns the sorcerer into a sort of paragon, the best of everything, everyone's ideal. but-but there's a drawback.
riley: a drawback?
xander: that happens a lot.
scene direction: giles reading the book over willow's shoulder
giles: yes. in order to balance the new force of good the spell has to create the opposing force of evil, the worst of everything, everyone's nightmare.
anya: he created the monster.
xander: so we're saying he did a spell just to make us think he was cool?
giles: yes.
xander: that is so cool!
riley: giles, buffy and jonathan are going after this nightmare thing. are they going to be ok?
giles: it seems that the well-being of this creature is linked to jonathan. if it dies the spell is broken and jonathan reverts to... whatever he was before.
anya: jonathan isn't gonna want buffy to get very far.
scene change: cut to interior of a cave.
scene direction: jonathan and buffy stop at the precipice of a seemingly bottomless pit.
buffy: wow! fall down there and be dead for a while.
jonathan: yeah.
scene direction: jonathan thinking and looking at buffy
jonathan: don't want that to happen.
scene direction: jonathan slowly reaches and grabs buffy's wrist as she is looking around the cave. buffy looks at him.
scene direction: jonathan leading her away from the pit
jonathan: come on. we've got a monster to...
scene direction: the monster growls as he strikes jonathan with an uppercut and sends him flying back over the pit. he falls unconscious. the monster roars.
scene change: *** act 4 ***
scene direction: willow confused
willow: buffy was right.
scene direction: willow trying again
willow: buffy was right.
anya: it doesn't sound very likely, does it?
riley: so if this is the world he created, what's the real world like?
willow: i'm scared. everything's going to change.
giles: well, actually it'll remain pretty much the same except jonathan won't be jonathan - not our jonathan, anyway.
xander: no! no! no! world without sunshine! world without joy!
riley: but wait, it only changes back if buffy kills this thing! i mean if she loses then we could be stuck in this wrong world forever!
xander: things looking up! i mean - we're all happy here right? you know if she doesn't get killed?
willow: giles, can buffy do it?
giles: i-i honestly don't know she's never stood alone against something like this before.
scene change: cut to interior of cave.
scene direction: jonathan is slowly waking up to the sounds of the monster growling and blows being exchanged.
scene direction: the monster grabs buffy and throws her. she tumbles and falls.
scene direction: trumpet music blares. jonathan flips to his feet, breaks off a stalactite and hits the monster in the head with it twice, driving it to its knees. buffy comes to. jonathan ducks a swipe and grabs the monster from behind.
buffy: jonathan what do i do?
jonathan: i think you're going to have to handle this one solo.
buffy: what? but i...
jonathan: you'll know, you used to. and the more you hurt it the more i'll lose my...
scene direction: he kicks the monster in the head while holding it.
buffy: what? lose your...
scene direction: jonathan spins the monster towards buffy. buffy trips the stumbling monster and it falls. jonathan shudders as if his strength is gone and hides behind a rock. buffy delivers a sequence of kicks to the monster. when the monster tries to strike her she catches its arm and kicks it twice more and it falls.
scene direction: buffy smiling
buffy: i remember this. this good.
scene direction: buffy tries to punch the monster but it catches her and throws her down. jonathan jumps out from behind the rock as the trumpets blare. the monster charges buffy but she kicks it again. again jonathan runs back behind the rock. buffy delivers some more kicks to the monster, knocking it down.
scene direction: the monster jumps to its feet and buffy charges it. it sidesteps and throws her down. one of her arms is in the pit and her head is over it. before the monster can finish off buffy, jonathan charges and tackles it from behind, knocking it into the pit. he falls in too but buffy reaches and grabs him by the ankle. he whimpers a little hanging upside down.
scene change: cut to a shimmering wave of light passes over the town.
scene direction: the billboard of jonathan selling shoes changes to a newspaper with a dalmatian saying they aren't just in black & white.
scene direction: a movie marquee saying 'being jonathan levinson' changes to 'closed for repairs'.
scene direction: a 'jonathan.com' poster changes to a 'the dingoes ate my baby' poster.
scene change: cut to campus lawns.
scene direction: daylight. the gang is sitting beside a tree. buffy, riley, xander, willow, anya and tara.
willow: i can't believe we believed it riley: it seemed so real.
buffy: well, in that world, it was real.
anya: alternate realities are neat.
xander: you know what i'll always remember?
riley: the swimsuit calendar's sticking in my mind.
scene direction: buffy looks at him and raises her eyebrows.
riley: not in a good way.
xander: i'll always remember the way he made me feel about me. valued, respected, sort of tingly... now i'm just empty.
scene direction: anya is also depressed.
buffy: poor xander. i guess jonathan hurt you most of all.
scene direction: tara raises her hand
tara: ummm.
buffy: except of course, after tara.
scene direction: willow smiles at tara.
riley: did anyone else feel way too tall? i felt way too tall.
scene direction: buffy sees jonathan looking over at her and walks to meet him.
xander: i liked his clothes. he had really cool clothes.
willow: still not understanding how he got the house and everything.
anya: and who really did star in the matrix?
scene direction: riley fading as buffy gets farther away
riley: wait. that wasn't real either?
jonathan: hi. i wasn't sure you'd come over. everyone's mostly forgetting. but, i think some people are kind of angry.
buffy: yeah!
jonathan: nobody's even talking to me. and... the twins moved out.
buffy: why did you do it anyway? no. i get why. how?
jonathan: after the thing with the bell tower and the gun, i went to counseling. you know other kids with problems a-and one of them had this spell. he glossed right over the monster. well, anyway i just - i-i just wanted to apologize. nobody was supposed to get hurt.
buffy: jonathan you get why everyone is angry though, right? it's not just the monster. people didn't like being the little actors in your sock puppet theater.
jonathan: you weren't! you weren't socks! we were friends.
buffy: jonathan you can't keep trying to make everything work out with some big gesture all at once. things are complicated. they take time and work.
jonathan: yeah, right.
scene direction: he turns to leave but stops and turns back.
jonathan: hey. hey buffy. you remember i gave you some advice?
scene direction: buffy less than amused
buffy: watch out for southpaws?
jonathan: uh, no about you and riley. i mean things are starting to blur but this cool thing i said, um, that i don't really remember... i think it's right. i think it's kind of the same thing you just said to me.
scene direction: jonathan pauses
jonathan: about things taking work.
scene direction: buffy thoughtful
buffy: yeah, i remember.
jonathan: good because it's true. what you have is really complicated but it's worth it. i think that's what i said.
scene direction: he walks away.
scene change: cut to riley's bedroom.
scene direction: buffy and riley are sitting and smooching.
buffy: i'm glad we talked this all out.
riley: we haven't talked at all.
buffy: oh. well whatever we're doing, we're doing it great.
scene direction: smooching resumes.
buffy: mmmmm... jonathan.
scene direction: riley pulls back. buffy is almost smiling.
scene direction: ironic music plays.
scene direction: end.
