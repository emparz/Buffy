scene direction: pop's pumpkin patch. the camera pans down from the sign over the stand past another one counting off the days until halloween to a pumpkin on the ground aglow with a candle. buffy lands flat on her back on top of it. she looks up at the vampire that just threw her and sees him coming toward her. she grabs a squash lying on the ground behind her and throws it at him, hitting him in the forehead. she follows it up with a pumpkin. the vampire staggers back a few steps. buffy hops back to her feet. she pulls a stake out of her shirt and launches it at him. he grabs the scarecrow and pulls it over in front of him so the stake impales it instead. he shoves the scarecrow aside and comes at her with a roundhouse kick. they start fighting hand-to-hand.
scene change: cut to a view of them through a camcorder. the 'record' light is on. cut to another vampire taping the fight. he gets closer for a better view.
scene change: cut to the view through the camcorder. buffy continues to fight the first vampire. the 'battery low' indicator starts flashing. a moment later the view becomes snowy, and the vampire takes the camcorder away from his eye. he jostles it, and it starts working again. he raises it back to his eye to continue recording.
scene direction: the fight goes on, and a few hits later the first vampire knocks buffy into the hay wagon. she holds onto the side of the wagon and kicks the vampire to the ground. she turns around with her back to the wagon and grabs the railing as the vampire gets back up. she raises her legs and grabs the vampire's head in a scissor hold. she twists her body and flips him over sideways onto the ground. stepping away from the wagon, she spies the sign and then looks down at the vampire. he tries to grab for her legs, so she jumps over him and somersaults to the countdown sign. she pulls it out of the ground and swings it at his legs as he comes for her, knocking them out from under him. she raises the sign and jams the end of the signpost into his chest. the vampire bursts into ashes. buffy leaves the sign stuck in the ground at its new location and walks out of the pumpkin patch. the second vampire lowers the camcorder and slowly backs away as he watches her go.
scene direction: opening credits roll. buffy's theme plays.
scene change: *** part 1 ***
scene direction: the bronze. a waitress picks up a tray of cappuccino and cupcakes. the camera follows her as she heads to her table. she turns to her right, but the camera continues through the crowd over to angel sitting alone at a table, looking very bored. a huge spider web and other halloween decorations adorn the staircase behind him. cordelia spots him with his bored look and comes over to his table. "shy", by epperley, is playing.
lyrics: i don't say much but i, but i like to sing.
cordelia: i know. is the bronze so not happening? or what?
scene direction: cordelia sets down her drink and sits
angel: oh. hi.
lyrics: won't tell you what i'm thinking.
cordelia: hi!
angel: i'm waiting for buffy.
lyrics: just have to wait and sing.
cordelia: great! i'm supposed to be meeting devon, but he's nowhere to be seen. it's like he thinks being in a band gives him an obligation to flake.
scene direction: angel smiles at the joke.
cordelia: well, his loss is your incredible gain!
scene change: cut to the door. buffy comes in, looks around and sees angel at the table with cordelia, laughing. cut to angel's table.
cordelia: so i told devon, 'you call that leather interior? my barbie dream car had nicer seats!'
scene direction: cordelia they both laugh
lyrics: i have no skin left on my, on my fingertips.
scene change: cut to buffy. she's upset seeing angel there with cordelia and turns around to leave. angel notices her as she's about to go.
angel: buffy?
scene direction: he gets up and hurries over to her.
angel: buffy!
lyrics: but still my heart pours out, out from my lips.
scene direction: buffy turns back around
buffy: hi! i'm...
angel: late.
buffy: rough day at the office.
scene direction: angel reaches up to her hair and pulls out a piece of straw.
angel: so i see.
lyrics: well i'm mute, but i'm not quite mute.
buffy: hey, it's a look. a seasonal look.
lyrics: and i say the things you want to hear.
scene direction: cordelia appears behind angel
cordelia: buffy. love the hair. it just screams street urchin.
scene direction: cordelia leaves
lyrics: i'm mute, but i'm not quite mute.
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: know what? i need to go...
scene direction: buffy loses the smile
buffy: put a bag over my head.
scene direction: buffy starts to go
lyrics: and i keep to myself to defend.
scene direction: angel grabs her arm
angel: don't listen to her. please. you look fine.
lyrics: yeah i'm alright.
buffy: you're sweet. a terrible liar, but sweet.
lyrics: oh now don't want to fight.
angel: i thought we had...
buffy: a date. so did i. but who am i kidding?
lyrics: i'm an angel burning out / oh now.
buffy: dates are things normal girls have. girls who have time to think about nail polish and facials. you know what i think about? ambush tactics. beheading. not exactly the stuff dreams are made of.
scene direction: buffy turns and goes out the door
scene direction: cordelia comes back
cordelia: cappuccino?
scene direction: she holds the cup up to him. he looks at her, down at the cappuccino and then back at the door.
scene change: cut to school the next day. sign-ups are being taken for the volunteer safety program for halloween. principal snyder takes one of the clipboards and looks around the hall. he grabs the next girl that walks by and pulls her aside.
girl: hey!
snyder: you're volunteering.
scene direction: he holds out the clipboard and pen to her. willow, buffy and xander come in from the other hall.
girl: but i have to get to class.
scene direction: snyder just shrugs. the team walks past him.
willow: snyder must be in charge of the volunteer safety program for halloween this year.
xander: note his interesting take on the volunteer concept.
buffy: what's the deal?
scene direction: they've reached willow's locker, and she works the combination.
xander: oh, a bunch of little kids need people to take them trick-or- treating. sign up and get your own pack of sugar-hyped little runts for the night.
buffy: yikes. i'll stick to vampires.
scene direction: snyder puts his hand on her shoulder, and she spins around to face him.
snyder: miss summers. just the juvenile delinquent i've been looking for.
buffy: principal snyder!
snyder: halloween must be a big night for you. tossing eggs, keying cars, bobbing for apples, one pathetic cry for help after another. well,
scene direction: snyder leads her to the sign-up table
snyder: not this year, missy.
scene direction: willow and xander come stand behind her.
buffy: gosh, i'd love to sign up, but i recently developed carpal tunnel syndrome, and can tragically no longer hold a flashlight.
scene direction: snyder holds up the clipboard and pen.
snyder: the program starts at four, the children have to be back at six.
scene direction: buffy reluctantly grabs the pen and clipboard and signs herself up.
scene change: xander thinks it's funny and smiles back at willow. willow has a concerned look on her face. snyder holds pens out to willow and xander, too. they both look at him, begging not to be put through this. willow gives in and takes the pen. cut to another part of the hall.
xander: i can't believe this. we have to get dressed up and the whole deal?
willow: snyder said costumes were mandatory.
buffy: great. i was gonna stay in and veg. the one night a year things are supposed to be quiet for me.
xander: halloween quiet? oh, i figured it'd be a big old vamp scare- apalooza.
scene direction: they walk into the lounge.
buffy: not according to giles. he swears that tomorrow night is, like, dead for the undead.
scene direction: buffy the girls sit
buffy: they stay in.
scene direction: xander smiling
xander: those wacky vampires! that's why i love 'em! they just keep you guessing!
scene direction: he puts his satchel down on the table and heads over to the soda vending machine. he puts in his coins and hits a button. nothing. he hits another one. still nothing. he hits the machine in the front and on the side. larry comes up to him and puts his hand on xander's shoulder.
larry: harris!
xander: hey, lar. you're lookin' cro-mag as usual. what can i do you for?
larry: you and buffy, you're just friends, right?
xander: i like to think of it less as a friendship and more as a solid foundation for future bliss.
larry: so, she, she's not your girlfriend?
xander: alas, no.
scene direction: larry looks over at buffy as he walks around xander.
larry: do you think she'd go out with me?
scene direction: he turns to face xander with buffy to his back now.
xander: well, lar, that's a tough question to... no. not a chance.
larry: why not? i heard some guys say she was fast.
xander: i hope you mean like the wind.
larry: yeah, you know what i mean.
xander: that's my friend that you're talkin' about!
larry: oh, yeah? well, what're you gonna do about it?
xander: i'm gonna do what any man would do about it:
scene direction: xander grabs larry by the shirt
xander: somethin' damn manly.
scene direction: larry smiles and laughs. he knocks xander's hands away and grabs him by the shirt with his right hand. he balls his left hand into a fist and draws back for a punch. buffy grabs his wrist, pulls it behind his back and slams his head into the vending machine. a diet dr pepper rolls into the slot.
buffy: get gone.
scene direction: she pulls larry back from the machine and shoves him away. she notices the soda can.
buffy: ooo! diet!
scene direction: buffy grabs the can
xander: do you know what you just did?
buffy: saved you a dollar?
xander: no, but larry was about to pummel me!
buffy: oh, that? forget about it!
scene direction: buffy heads back to the table
xander: oh, i'll forget about it.
scene direction: xander follows her
xander: in maybe fifteen, twenty years when my rep for being a sissy man finally fades!
scene direction: buffy stops and faces him
buffy: xander, don't you think you're...
scene direction: xander interrupts
xander: a black eye heals, buffy, but cowardice has an unlimited shelf life. oh, thanks! thanks a lot for *your* help.
scene direction: he grabs his bag from the table and walks off in a huff. buffy moans and sits back down with willow.
buffy: i think i just violated the guy code big time.
willow: poor xander. boys are so fragile. speaking of, how was your date last night?
buffy: misfire. i was late due to unscheduled slayage. showed up looking trashed.
willow: was he mad?
buffy: actually he was pretty unmad. which probably had something to do with the fact that cordelia was drooling in his cappuccino.
willow: oh, buffy. angel would never fall for her act.
buffy: you mean that 'actually showing up, wearing a stunning outfit, embracing personal hygiene' act?
willow: you know what i mean. uh, she's not his type.
buffy: are you sure? i mean, i don't know what his type is. i've known him less than a year, and if you haven't noticed, he's not exactly one to over share.
willow: true. it's too bad we can't sneak a look at the watcher diaries and read up on angel. i'm sure it's full of fun facts to know and tell.
buffy: yeah. it's too bad. that stuff is private.
willow: also giles keeps them in his office. in his personal files.
buffy: most importantly, it would be wrong.
scene change: cut to the library. willow and buffy look in through the round door window. they don't see giles and give each other a look. buffy quietly opens the door and goes in. she looks back at willow, who gives her encouragement. the door closes and willow looks in through the glass.
scene direction: buffy quietly makes her way up to the counter and looks around again for giles. satisfied that he's not there she heads for his office.
giles: buffy!
scene direction: she spins around and sees him in the cage getting some old books.
giles: excellent!
buffy: nothing! hi!
giles: yes, i-i just wanted to talk to you about tomorrow night. as it should be, uh, calm, you might work on some new battle techniques.
buffy: you're beginning to scare me, giles. you need to have some fun.
scene direction: she waves to willow to come in as he's looking down at his books. willow shakes her head and mouths 'no'. giles looks up, and buffy pulls her hand back and pretends she was scratching her head.
buffy: you know, there's this place you can go, right, and you sit in the dark, and there are these moving pictures, right, and the pictures tell a story.
giles: yes, yes, ha, ha, very droll.
scene direction: willow quietly comes in.
giles: i'll have you know that i have very, uh, many relaxing hobbies.
buffy: such as?
giles: well, um...
scene direction: buffy mouths something to willow to goad her on.
giles: i enjoy cross-referencing.
buffy: do you stuff your own shirts, or do you send them out?
scene direction: she grabs a book from the stack he's about to take to his office and walks around him to draw his view away from his office door.
buffy: so! how come halloween is such a big yawner? i mean, do the demons just hate how commercial it's become?
scene direction: buffy leafs through the book
scene direction: giles puts his books down
giles: um, it's interesting, ac... not, i suspect, to you.
scene direction: giles takes the book from her
giles: what is it you're after?
scene direction: willow has made it to the office door.
buffy: of course, it's of interest to me! i'm the slayer. i need to know these things. you can't keep me in the dark any longer.
scene direction: willow opens the door and starts in. giles grabs the stack of books again and starts to turn to his office.
buffy: look at me when i talk to you!
scene direction: willow looks over at them anxiously.
giles: i really don't have time for these games.
buffy: ms. calendar said you were a babe.
scene direction: willow looks back again, but this time gives buffy a look and shakes her head.
giles: she said what?
scene direction: buffy meekly
buffy: well, she said that you were a... h-hunk of burning... something or other. so,
scene direction: buffy exhales
buffy: whadaya think of that?
giles: uh, i...
scene direction: giles exhales
giles: i don't, um, uh... a burning hunk of what?
buffy: look. you know how disgusting it is for me to even contemplate you grownups having smoochies,
scene direction: buffy sees willow come out of the office with a diary
buffy: but i think you should go for it.
giles: buffy, i appreciate your interest, but...
scene direction: willow hurries past the counter.
buffy: but i've overstepped my bounds. it's none of my business, you know.
scene direction: buffy stammers
buffy: what was i thinking? my god! shame,
scene direction: buffy willow goes out the door
buffy: shame. i gotta go.
scene direction: buffy quickly walks out
scene direction: giles not sure what to make of it
giles: a babe?
scene direction: giles smirks
giles: i can live with that.
scene change: cut to the girls' bathroom. buffy and willow are sitting on the sinks and looking at a drawing of a noble woman with a tiny waist wearing a billowy gown.
buffy: man, look at her.
willow: who is she?
buffy: it doesn't say, but the entry's dated 1775.
willow: angel was eighteen. and still human.
buffy: so that's the kinda girl he hung around? she's pretty coiffed.
willow: she looks like a noble woman or something. which means being beautiful is sort of her job.
buffy: and clearly this girl was a workaholic. i'll never be like this.
willow: c'mon! she's not that pretty. i mean, look at her. she's got a funny... uh, waist. look how tiny that is.
scene direction: buffy sarcastically
buffy: thank you. now i feel better.
scene direction: willow exhales
willow: no. she's like a freak. a circus freak. yuk.
scene direction: buffy exhales
buffy: musta been wonderful. put on some fantabulous gown and go to a ball like a princess, and have horses and servants, and yet more gowns.
willow: yeah. still, i think i prefer being able to vote.
scene direction: willow buffy raises her brows
scene direction: willow smiles
willow: or i will when i can.
scene direction: cordelia comes into the bathroom and goes to the mirror.
cordelia: so, buffy. you ran off last night and left poor little angel all by his lonesome. but i did everything i could to comfort him.
buffy: i'll bet.
scene direction: cordelia gets out her blush
cordelia: so, what's his story anyway? i mean, i never see him around.
scene direction: cordelia brushes some onto her cheeks
willow: not during the day, anyway.
cordelia: oh, please. don't tell me he still lives at home. like, he has to wait for his dad to get back before he can take the car?
scene direction: cordelia puts the blush away
buffy: cordelia, i think his parents have been dead for a couple of hundred years.
scene direction: cordelia touches up her lip gloss
cordelia: oh, good. i mean...
scene direction: cordelia faces them
scene direction: what?
buffy: angel's a vampire. i thought you knew.
scene direction: cordelia turns back to the mirror
cordelia: oh, he's a vampire.
scene direction: cordelia puts away the lip gloss
cordelia: of course! but the cuddly kind. like a carebear with fangs?
willow: it's true.
scene direction: cordelia steps over to them
cordelia: you know what i think?
scene direction: cordelia crosses her arms
cordelia: i just think you're trying to scare me off 'cause you're afraid of the competition. look, buffy, you may be hot stuff when it comes to demonology or whatever, but when it comes to dating, i'm the slayer.
scene direction: she walks out. buffy just watches her go.
scene change: cut to ethan's costume shop. the store is full of mothers with their kids looking for halloween costumes. buffy is handling a plastic pumpkin when it suddenly lights up and screams. she quickly puts it back on the counter. willow comes over to her.
buffy: what'd you get?
willow: a time-honored classic!
scene direction: willow holds up a ghost costume
buffy: okay, will, can i give you a little friendly advice?
willow: it's not spooky enough?
buffy: it's just... you're never gonna get noticed if you keep hiding. you're missing the whole point of halloween.
scene direction: willow smiles
willow: free candy?
buffy: it's come as you aren't night. the perfect chance for a girl to get sexy and wild with no repercussions.
willow: oh, i don't get wild. wild on me equals spaz.
buffy: don't underestimate yourself. you've got it in you.
willow: hey, xander!
scene direction: he comes up to them.
willow: what'd you get?
scene direction: he pulls a toy military rifle out of his bag and holds it up for willow to see.
buffy: that's not a costume.
scene direction: xander gives buffy a look, then turns to willow
xander: i got fatigues from an army surplus at home. call me the two-dollar costume king, baby!
scene direction: he smiles at willow. she smiles back.
buffy: hey, look, xander...
scene direction: buffy he points the rifle at her
buffy: i'm... really sorry about this morning.

scene direction: buffy puts her chin on his shoulder and pouts
scene direction: xander rolls his eyes
xander: thank you.
scene direction: xander buffy smiles
xander: okay, y'know, actually i think i could've t...

xander: hello! that was our touching reconciliation moment there.
scene direction: she keeps walking over to a frilly, red, billowy 18th-century gown.
buffy: i'm sorry, it's just... look at this.
willow: it's amazing.
xander: too bulky. i prefer my women in spandex.
scene direction: ethan notices her looking at the dress and comes over to them.

scene direction: drusilla breathes at spike's neck
drusilla: it makes her weak.

xander: how do you explain this?
buffy: i don't! i was brought up a proper lady. i-i wasn't meant to understand things. i'm just meant to look pretty, and then someone nice will marry me. possibly a baron.

giles: well, alright, l-let's, let's, let's review.
scene direction: giles sets the papers on the table
giles: um, so everybody became, uh, whatever they were masquerading as.

willow: no! she was the same old cordelia. just in a cat costume.
giles: she didn't change.
willow: no. hold on... partytown. she told us she got her outfit from partytown.

scene change: *** part 4 ***
scene direction: the alley. buffy looks around, trying to decide what to do. she lifts her skirt a bit and starts to walk. she turns around to look behind her and takes a few steps backward. when she turns back around larry, who has turned into a pirate, startles her. he smiles widely at her, showing his rotten teeth.
larry: pretty, pretty!
scene direction: buffy tries to run away, and larry gives chase.
scene change: cut to ethan's costume shop. giles looks around as he and willow come in.
giles: hello! anyone home?
scene direction: willow sees the curtain to the back room partially open.
willow: giles...
scene direction: they slowly go in and see the statue of janus there. its eyes glow green.
giles: janus. roman mythical god.
willow: what does this mean?
giles: primarily the division of self. male and female, light and dark.
scene direction: ethan appears
ethan: chunky and creamy. oh, no, sorry, that's peanut butter.
scene direction: giles stares at ethan as though he's seen a ghost.
giles: willow, get out of here, now.
willow: but...
giles: now!
scene direction: she obeys him and goes.
giles: hello, ethan.
ethan: hello, ripper.
scene change: cut to the alley. buffy backs away from larry. she turns to run, but trips and falls. her gown billows out around her. larry grabs her as she tries to get up and shoves her against a crate. he pushes her hair away from her frightened face and moves in to kiss her. xander comes running and tackles larry down to the pavement. he gets up and pulls larry up and into a metal warehouse door. he punches him in the face and gut.
scene direction: larry pushes him off and into the opposite alley wall and punches him back in the gut. xander grabs larry's arm and pulls it behind his back, forcing him to bend over, and knees him in the stomach. cordelia arrives behind buffy with angel.
cordelia: buffy! are you okay?
scene direction: buffy sees angel, yelps and cowers behind a box.
cordelia: what's your deal? take a pill!
scene direction: larry attacks xander with his pirate's sword. xander sidesteps him, grabs him by the wrist and twists his arm around, making him drop the sword. he lifts larry back up and punches him, sending him sprawling into a pile of trash.
buffy: he's, he's a vampire!
scene direction: cordelia to angel
cordelia: she's got this thing where she thinks...
scene direction: cordelia exasperated
cordelia: uhhh, forget it.
scene direction: cordelia to buffy
cordelia: it's okay. angel is a good vampire. he would never hurt you.
scene direction: buffy slowly stands up
buffy: really?
cordelia: absolutely. he's our friend.
scene direction: angel heads over to xander fighting larry. xander punches larry, sending him into the pile of trash and a stack of boxes again. several boxes fall off of the top and onto larry. he is knocked out cold.
scene direction: xander to angel
xander: it's strange, but beating up that pirate gave me a weird sense of closure.
scene direction: willow comes running down the alley from the other end.
willow: guys!
angel: willow!
willow: guys, you gotta get inside.
scene direction: she looks back and they see spike and his monster gang coming.
xander: we need a triage!
scene direction: angel points the other way
angel: this way! find an open warehouse.
scene direction: xander turns and picks up his rifle.
xander: ladies, we're on the move!
scene direction: he quickly heads down the alley. cordelia and willow follow him. angel lifts buffy and carries her away. spike and the monsters walk after them at a quick, deliberate pace.
scene change: cut to ethan's.
ethan: what? no hug? aren't you pleased to see your old mate, rupert?
giles: i'm just surprised i didn't guess it was you. this halloween stunt stinks of ethan rayne.
ethan: yes, it does, doesn't it? don't wish to blow my own trumpet, but it's genius. the very embodiment of 'be careful what you wish for'.
giles: it's sick, brutal, and it harms the innocent.
ethan: oh, and we all know that you are the champion of innocents and all things pure and good, rupert. it's quite a little act you've got going here, old man.
giles: it's no act. it's who i am.
ethan: who you are? the watcher, sniveling, tweed-clad guardian of the slayer and her kin? i think not. i know who you are, rupert, and i know what you're capable of.
scene direction: ethan considers
ethan: but they don't, do they? they have no idea where you come from.
giles: break the spell, ethan. then leave this place and never come back.
ethan: why should i? what's in the bargain for me?
giles: you get to live.
ethan: oh, rupert, you're scaring me.
scene direction: giles punches him in the gut with a left, making him double over, and follows up with a right to the face.
scene change: cut to the alley. angel has gotten ahead of the others and finds an open warehouse.
angel: over here!
scene direction: xander pushes the door aside, and they all hurry in.
xander: check if there are any other ways in!
scene direction: he slides the door closed again as angel sets buffy back down on her feet next to cordelia.
angel: just stay here.
