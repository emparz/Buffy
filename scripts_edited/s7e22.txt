scene direction: cut to 7 int. pyramidal tomb - night
scene direction: resume. angel and buffy are kissing inside the tomb as spike looks on from the shadows.
scene direction: angel pulls back from the kiss
angel: well, i guess that qualifies as "happy to see me."
scene direction: buffy looks into angel's eyes, smiling
buffy: angel, what are you doing—
scene direction: buffy shakes her head
buffy: don't even. i just want to bask.
scene direction: buffy looks into angel's eyes, smiling, for a few seconds, then snaps out of it
buffy: ok, i'm basked. what are you doing here?
angel: not saving the damsel in distress, that's for sure.
buffy: oh, you know me.
scene direction: buffy picks up scythe
buffy: not much with the damseling.
angel: got your share of distress, though.
scene direction: angel walks to the wall
buffy: you heard?
scene direction: angel picks up a file folder from a bench by the wall
angel: i got coverage on the whole thing. it's very gripping. it needs a third act.
scene direction: buffy shakes her head at him
buffy: you have to leave l.a.
angel: it's the first, right? the first evil. the power that tried to convince me to kill myself.
buffy: yeah. it's gotten a little more ambitious since then. it's raising an army.
angel: yeah, well, it failed once, and i'm here to tell you—
scene direction: caleb stands up behind angel and knocks angel down by hitting him with a cat statue, sending him across the floor. caleb walks up to buffy, black blood streaming from his eyes and nose.
caleb: are you ready to finish this, bitch?!
scene direction: opening credits.
scene change: *** act i ***
scene direction: cut to 8 int. pyramidal tomb - night
scene direction: resume. caleb, who's still holding his cat statue, has just confronted buffy in the tomb after having knocked angel out.
scene direction: caleb swings the cat statue at buffy, but she blocks with the scythe and then falls to the ground. she swings at him with the scythe, but he blocks with the cat statue. caleb knocks buffy to the ground, then throws the cat statue at buffy. buffy stands, holding the scythe.
scene direction: buffy breathing hard
buffy: ok...how many times do i have to kill you? ballpark figure.
caleb: you understand nothing.
scene direction: buffy swings at caleb, but he grabs the scythe, holding it still, and punches buffy in the face twice. he lifts buffy in the air, pressing her back against the low ceiling. buffy struggles, and caleb finally lets her fall to the floor. he walks up to her slowly, then picks her up by her lapels.
scene direction: caleb through gritted teeth
caleb: you think you have power over me?
scene direction: buffy breaks free of his grip and kicks him, knocking him down to the floor.
caleb: stupid girl.
scene direction: caleb stands
caleb: you'll never stop me. you don't have the ba—
scene direction: while caleb gets to his feet, buffy twirls the scythe and swings it up between his legs. caleb's eyes go wide.
buffy: who does nowadays?
scene direction: caleb looks down incredulously at the scythe lodged in his body between his legs. buffy swiftly pushes the scythe up through his body.
scene direction: angel lying on the floor, regains consciousness and stands, angrily
angel: ok, now i'm pissed. where is he?
scene direction: buffy looks to her right, then to her left, then at angel
buffy: he had to split.
scene direction: buffy giggles devilishly
scene direction: first [buffy] whispering to spike, who's still watching buffy from the shadows
first [buffy]: yeah, she needs you real bad.
scene direction: angel picks up the folder again and brings it to buffy.
buffy: i'll have the guys go through that. see if there's anything new. reliable source?
angel: not remotely.
buffy: mm, any port in an apocalypse.
angel: i, uh, brought something else as well.
scene direction: angel takes an amulet out of his pocket and holds it up for buffy to see. it's a 2-inch diameter round crystal pendant in a silver starburst setting hung from a coarse silver chain.
scene direction: buffy shakes her head
buffy: i can already tell you, i have nothing that goes with that.
angel: it's not for you.
buffy: splainy?
angel: i don't know everything. it's very powerful and probably very dangerous. it has a purifying power, a cleansing power, possibly scrubbing bubbles. the translation is, uh—anyway, it bestows strength to the right person who wears it.
buffy: and the right person is?
angel: someone ensouled, but stronger than human. a champion. as in me.
buffy: or me.
angel: no. i don't know nearly enough about this to risk you wearing it. besides, you got that real cool axe-thing going for you.
scene direction: spike walks out the back without being noticed.
buffy: so you're gonna be with me in this.
angel: shoulder to shoulder. i'm yours.
buffy: no.
angel: no, what?
buffy: no. you're not gonna be in this fight.
scene direction: buffy walks away
scene direction: angel cuts her off
angel: why the hell not?
buffy: 'cause i can't risk you.
angel: you need me in this.
buffy: no, i need you gone.
angel: why?
buffy: if i lose, if this thing gets past sunnydale, then it's days—maybe hours—before the rest of the world goes. i need a second front, and i need you to run it.
angel: ok...
scene direction: angel crosses his arms
angel: that's one reason. what's the other?
scene direction: buffy walks out of the tomb
buffy: there is no other.
scene direction: cut to 9 ext. pyramidal tomb - night
scene direction: buffy walks out of the tomb. angel follows her.
angel: is it spike?
scene direction: angel buffy stops walking, turns to face angel
angel: you're not telling me something. and his scent, i remember it pretty well.
buffy: you vampires. did anybody ever tell you the whole smelling people thing's a little gross?
scene direction: buffy walks away
scene direction: angel follows
angel: is he your boyfriend?
buffy: is that your business?
angel: you in love with him? ok, maybe i'm outta line, but this is kind of a curve ball for me. i mean, we are talking about spike here.
buffy: it's different. he's different. he has a soul now.
scene direction: angel stops
angel: oh.
scene direction: angel looks up
angel: well.
buffy: what?
angel: that's great.
scene direction: angel mumbling to himself
angel: everyone's got a soul now.
buffy: he'll make a difference.
scene direction: angel mumbling
angel: you know, i started it. the whole having a soul. before it was all the cool new thing.
buffy: oh, my god. are you 12?
angel: i'm getting the brush off for captain peroxide. it doesn't necessarily bring out the champion in me.
buffy: you're not getting the brush off. are you just gonna come here and go all dawson on me every time i have a boyfriend?
angel: aha!
scene direction: angel points
angel: boyfriend!
buffy: he's not. but...he is in my heart.
angel: that'll end well.
scene direction: angel walks away, leans on a tombstone
buffy: what was the highlight of our relationship? when you broke up with me or when i killed you? i'm well aware of my stellar history with guys...
scene direction: buffy sighs, leans beside angel
buffy: and, no, i don't see fat grandchildren in the offing with spike, but i don't think that really matters right now.
scene direction: buffy chuckles
buffy: you know, in the midst of all this insanity, a couple things are actually starting to make sense. and the guy thing—
scene direction: buffy sighs
buffy: i always feared there was something wrong with me, you know, because i couldn't make it work. but maybe i'm not supposed to.
angel: because you're the slayer?
scene direction: buffy looks at angel
buffy: because—ok, i'm cookie dough. i'm not done baking. i'm not finished becoming whoever the hell it is i'm gonna turn out to be. i make it through this, and the next thing, and the next thing, and maybe one day i turn around and realize i'm ready. i'm cookies. and then, you know, if i want someone to eat—
scene direction: buffy eyes go wide as she catches herself
buffy: or enjoy warm, delicious cookie me, then...that's fine. that'll be then. when i'm done.
angel: any thoughts on who might enjoy—
scene direction: angel sighs, irritated
angel: do i have to go with the cookie analogy?
buffy: i'm not really thinking that far ahead. that's kind of the point.
scene direction: angel hands the amulet to buffy
angel: i'll go start working on the second front. make sure i don't have to use it.
scene direction: angel walks away
scene direction: buffy calls after him
buffy: angel.
scene direction: buffy he turns to look at her
buffy: i do... sometimes think that far ahead.
angel: sometimes is something.
scene direction: angel smiles, walks away
buffy: be a long time coming. years, if ever.
scene direction: angel shrugs
angel: i ain't getting any older.
scene direction: angel walks away
scene direction: cut to 10 int. dining room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: dawn is waiting by the front door when buffy walks in. buffy's surprised to see her. dawn kicks buffy in the shin.
buffy: ow.
dawn: dumbass.
scene direction: buffy looks over at xander, who's in the dining room with anya, giles, and willow.
xander: don't look at me. this is a summers' thing. it's all very violent.
scene direction: buffy looks at dawn
buffy: if you get killed, i'm telling.
scene direction: buffy walks into the dining room; dawn follows
willow: did you find out anything about the scythe?
buffy: it slices, dices, and makes julienne preacher.
giles: caleb?
buffy: i cut him in half.
willow: all right!
anya: he had that coming.
xander: hey, party in my eye socket and everyone's invited.
scene direction: xander everyone stares at xander
xander: sometimes i shouldn't say words.
scene direction: cut to 11 int. basement at buffy's house - night
scene direction: spike is in the basement punching a punching bag when buffy walks down the stairs.
spike: so...where's tall, dark and forehead?
scene direction: buffy rolls her eyes
buffy: let me guess. you can smell him.
spike: yeah, that and i also used my enhanced vampire eyeballs to watch you kissing him.
scene direction: buffy awkwardly
buffy: it was...a hello.
spike: most people don't use their tongues to say hello. or i guess they do, but—
buffy: there were no tongues. besides, he's gone.
spike: oh, just popped by for a quickie, then?
scene direction: buffy walks away
buffy: good, good. i haven't had quite enough jealous vampire crap for one night.
spike: he wears lifts, you know.
scene direction: buffy looks over at the punching bag that spike was hitting and sees something has been taped to it - a sketch drawn in black marker on white paper, shows hair that sticks straight up, x's for eyes and fangs on the frowny face. buffy rolls her eyes at the representation of angel.
buffy: you know, one of these days i'm just gonna put you 2 in a room and let you wrestle it out.
scene direction: spike rifling through an empty cigarette package
spike: no problem at this end.
scene direction: spike throws the package away in disgust
scene direction: buffy her eyes widen with excitement
buffy: there could be oil of some kind involved.
scene direction: spike walks up to buffy
spike: where's the trinket?
buffy: the who-ket?
spike: the pretty necklace your sweetie-bear gave you. the one with all the power. i believe it's mine now.
buffy: how do you figure?
spike: someone with a soul, but more than human? angel meant to wear it, that means i'm the qualified party.
scene direction: spike holds out his hands
buffy: it's volatile. we don't know—
spike: you'll be needing someone strong to bear it, then. you planning on giving it to andrew?
scene direction: buffy looks at the amulet, then at spike
buffy: angel said the amulet was meant to be worn by a champion.
scene direction: spike looks down, disappointed, but buffy walks forward and hands it to him.
spike: been called a lot of things in my time.
scene direction: buffy coyly
buffy: faith still has my room.
spike: well, you're not staying here. you can't buy me off with shiny beads and sweet talk. you got angel breath. i'm not gonna just let you whack me back and forth like a rubber ball. i've got my pride, you know.
buffy: i understand.
scene direction: buffy turns to walk away
scene direction: spike cuts her off
spike: clearly you don't, 'cause the whole "having my pride" thing was just a smokescreen.
scene direction: buffy sighs with relief
buffy: oh, thank god.
spike: i don't know what i would have done if you'd have gone up those stairs.
scene direction: later, buffy and spike are lying together on the cot, fully clothed. spike has his arm around buffy and she fondles his hand. he rolls over, removing his arm from her, and she sits up. she stands and paces around the basement. she is looking out the window, staring at the night sky when first [caleb] appears.
first [caleb]: pretty, ain't it?
buffy: you're not him.
first [caleb]: no, you killed him right and proper. terrible loss. this man was my good right arm. 'course, it don't pain me too much. don't need an arm. got an army.
buffy: an army of vampires. however will i fight—
first [caleb]: every day our numbers swell. but then you do have an army of your own. some thirty-odd pimply-faced girls, don't know the pointy end of a stake.
scene direction: first [caleb] feigns concern
first [caleb]: maybe i should call this off.
buffy: have you ever considered a cool name? i mean, since you're incorporeal and basically powerless. how about "the taunter?" strikes fear in the heart—
first [caleb]: i will overrun this earth. and when my army outnumbers the humans on this earth, the scales will tip and i will be made flesh.
buffy: talk on. i'm not afraid of you.
scene direction: first [caleb] rolls eyes
first [caleb]: then why aren't you asleep in your dead lover's arms?
scene direction: first [caleb] looks over at spike
first [caleb]: 'cause he can't help you. nor faith, nor your friends, certainly not your wanna-slay brigade. none of those girlies will ever know real power unless you're dead. you know the drill:
scene direction: first [caleb] morphs into buffy's form
first [buffy]: into every generation, a slayer is born. one girl in all the world. she alone will have the strength and skill to— there's that word again. what you are. how you'll die. alone. where's your snappy comeback?
buffy: you're right.
first [buffy]: hmm. not your best.
scene direction: spike talking in his sleep
spike: i'm drowning in footwear!
scene direction: spike sits up with a start; buffy turns to look at him and buffy/first disappears
spike: weird dream.
scene direction: spike notices buffy standing in the middle of the room
spike: buffy? is something wrong?
buffy: no. yeah. i just realized something. something that really never occurred to me before. we're gonna win.
scene change: fade to black.
scene change: *** act ii ***
scene direction: cut to 12 int. buffy's room at buffy's house - day
scene direction: close-up of dawn, xander, anya, and willow staring incredulously at buffy. pan out to show that we were seeing their reflection in the mirror beside buffy. buffy's looking at all of them.
buffy: what do you think?
xander: that depends. are you in any way...kidding?
buffy: you don't think it's a good idea?
scene direction: faith standing on the opposite side of the mirror from buffy
faith: it's pretty radical, b.
scene direction: giles sitting by the window
giles: it's a lot more than that.
scene direction: giles stands
giles: buffy, what you said, it—it flies in the face of everything we've ever—every generation has ever done in the fight against evil.
scene direction: giles smiles
giles: i think it's bloody brilliant.
buffy: you mean that?
giles: if you want my opinion.
buffy: i really do.
willow: whoa, hey. not to poop on the party here, but i'm the guy that's gonna have to pull this thing off.
faith: it is beaucoup d'mojo.
willow: this goes beyond anything i've ever done. it's a total loss of control, and not in a nice, wholesome, my girlfriend has a pierced tongue kind of way.
scene direction: dawn looks at willow. giles looks away.
buffy: i wouldn't ask if i didn't think you could do it.
willow: i—i'm not sure that i'm stable enough.
giles: you can do this, willow. we'll get the coven on the line, and we'll find out how they can help.
dawn: oh!
scene direction: dawn nods
dawn: "pierced tongue."
scene direction: buffy panicky
buffy: dawn needs to do a research thing.
scene direction: giles quickly
giles: yes, you do.
scene direction: dawn rolls her eyes
dawn: it's cool.
scene direction: dawn stands, walks out
dawn: watcher junior to the library.
giles: i'll go dig up my sources. quite literally, actually.
scene direction: giles walks out of the room
scene direction: anya to xander
anya: come on, let's go assemble the cannon fodder.
xander: that's not what we're calling them, sweetie.
scene direction: xander walks out
scene direction: anya walks out
anya: not to their faces. what, am i insensitive?
scene direction: buffy hands the scythe over to willow. faith is standing beside buffy.
scene direction: cut to 13 int. living room at buffy's house - day
scene direction: buffy addresses a room full of potentials and her friends.
buffy: i hate this. i hate being here. i hate that you have to be here. i hate that there's evil, and that i was chosen to fight it. i wish, a whole lot of the time, that i hadn't been. i know a lot of you wish i hadn't been either.
scene direction: buffy kennedy and rona look away
buffy: but this isn't about wishes. this is about choices. i believe we can beat this evil. not when it comes, not when its army is ready, now. tomorrow morning i'm opening the seal. i'm going down into the hellmouth, and i'm finishing this once and for all. right now you're asking yourself, "what makes this different? what makes us anything more than a bunch of girls being picked off one by one?" it's true none of you have the power that faith and i do. so here's the part where you make a choice.
scene direction: cut to 14 int. basement at sunnydale high - day
scene direction: faith and robin wood are moving furniture around.
robin: it's one hell of a risky idea.
faith: buffy's wacky that way.
robin: yeah. there's one more vent right by the stairs. we block that, they got no sewer access, should drive them straight up into the school proper.
faith: that's assuming they get past us.
robin: which, no offense, i am.
faith: come on, you gotta have a little faith.
scene direction: robin under his breath
robin: i think i've had my share, thanks.
faith: well, i trundled right into that one, didn't i? look, i'm sorry if it seemed like i was blowing you off the other day. i was just trying to, you know, blow you off.
robin: yeah, you know what, i figured that one out all by myself.
faith: it's nothing personal. it's just after i get bouncy with a guy, there's not that much more i need
scene direction: to know about him.
robin: that's bleak.
faith: way of the world.
robin: that's good to know 'cause for a second there i thought it was more defensive, isolationist slayer crap.
scene direction: faith laughs
faith: and he comes out swinging.
robin: faith, there's a whole world out there that you don't even know about, and a lot of the men in it are pretty decent guys. they'd surprise you.
scene direction: faith shrugs
faith: guy looks at me, let's just say his priorities shift.
robin: why, because you're so hot?
faith: it's what it is, yo.
robin: oh, please. i am so much prettier than you are.
scene direction: robin faith seems taken aback
robin: oh, and, uh, for the record, our little encounter didn't exactly change my world.
faith: you're tripping! that was rock 'em, sock 'em!
robin: no, no, no, no. it was—it was—it was nice enough, you know, and you're—you're very, um... mm, enthused, and i think with a little more experience—
faith: dude, i got mad skills.
robin: yeah, of course. let's finish up.
faith: no, hell with that. we're going again, baby.
scene direction: faith starts unbuckling her belt
faith: you're gonna learn a little respect here, pal.
robin: faith—
scene direction: robin chuckles
robin: make me a deal, all right? we live through this, you give me the chance to surprise you.
faith: what would be the surprise?
scene direction: robin looks at her
robin: you do know the meaning of the word, right?
faith: fine.
scene direction: faith rebuckles her belt
faith: deal.
robin: good enough.
faith: no way you're prettier than me.
robin: a little bit, yeah.
scene direction: cut to 15 int. willow's room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: willow's working intently at her desk while kennedy stretches herself across the bed behind her, playing with willow's hair.
willow: i really wish she hadn't said that about me.
kennedy: what, the thing buffy said? i think it's true.
scene direction: kennedy willow squeaks with uncertainty
kennedy: i'll be with you. to keep you grounded.
willow: yeah, well, you might have to keep me stab-ded, if i go to the bad place.
scene direction: kennedy sits up, looks at willow
kennedy: you're saying i might have to kill you.
willow: i am.
kennedy: bite me.
willow: i will. i mean, i do... mean it. the darkest place i've ever been, this is what lies beyond that. this is too important for me to—
kennedy: buffy believes in you.
willow: you know, buffy: sweet girl, not that bright.
kennedy: hey, i'm the first one to call her out when she's not making sense. in fact, this may have escaped your keen notice, but i'm kind of a brat. i've always sort of gotten my way. so you're gonna make it through this, no matter how dark it gets. because now... you're my way.
scene direction: they kiss.
scene direction: willow back to her paperwork
willow: i better go over this again.

xander: by the pillar, yeah. i'm protecting this area.
giles: that puts me over by the door. demons around the perimeter— right! i open the door.
scene direction: pan over to show andrew is also at the table, but he's wearing a red hooded cloak.
scene direction: andrew reading from a book
andrew: you go through the door and are confronted by trogdor the burninator.
giles: oh, bugger it. fight.
scene direction: giles rolls dice, sips wine
andrew: adios to 5 hit points. trogdor has badly wounded you.
giles: well, wait a minute. what about my...
scene direction: giles puts on glasses
giles: bag of illusions?
scene direction: andrew scoffs
andrew: illusions against a burninator? silly, silly british man.
scene direction: andrew giles sips his wine again
amanda: i invoke a time flux on trogdor.
scene direction: andrew looks at amanda
andrew: step down, girlfriend, you can't just—
amanda: ninth level sorcerer, and i carry the emerald chalice. trogdor is frozen in time. deal with it.
scene direction: amanda writes something down
xander: smackdown on red riding hood. this could get ugly.
giles: could it possibly get uglier? i used to be a highly respected watcher, and now i'm a wounded dwarf with the mystical strength of a doily. i just wish i could sleep.
amanda: what kind of person could sleep on a night like this?
scene direction: xander looks over at anya, who's passed out on the table in the chair beside him

robin: welcome to sunnydale high.
scene direction: cut to 20 int. hallway at sunnydale high - day
scene direction: robin leads the gang into the school as if instructing a class on a field trip.
robin: there's no running in the halls, no yelling, no gum chewing. apart from that, there's only one rule.
scene direction: robin stops walking, turns to look at the crowd
robin: if they move, kill them.
buffy: ok, potentials, in the basement. follow faith and spike.
scene direction: faith and spike leave; potentials follow.
xander: if you have to go to the bathroom, it's to your left. if you don't have to go to the bathroom, picture what you're about to face. better to go now.

scene direction: robin points
buffy: it's right over the seal.
kennedy: i'll start getting you set up.
scene direction: kennedy takes the bag from willow

robin: ok, civilians. the vampires get upstairs, we have 3 areas they could get through to another building and then down into the sewers.
scene direction: robin points
robin: down the hall in the atrium, the north hall here, and the primary target, through the lounge straight to the science building. now odds are, most of them will head there.
giles: teams of 2 then. i suggest you and i take the lounge.
robin: i concur.
buffy: xander, i want you with dawn.
xander: i concur.
dawn: we'll check out the atrium.

buffy: so, what do you guys want to do tomorrow?
willow: nothing strenuous.
xander: well, mini-golf is always the first thing that comes to mind.
giles: i think we can do better than that.
buffy: i was thinking about shopping. as per usual.
willow: oh! there's an arden b. in the new mall!
xander: i could use a few items.
giles: well, now aren't we gonna discuss this? save the world to go to the mall?

xander: aren't you on the patch?
willow: those never work.
giles: here i am, invisible to the eye...
scene direction: xander, willow, and buffy walk down the hall together away from giles.
xander: see, i need a new look. it's this whole eye patch thing.
