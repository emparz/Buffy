dawn: so the basement was filled with bodies?
willow: apparently.
dawn: and spike could've sired countless others and buried them around town. and we're waiting for him to do what, exactly? do something crazy?
scene direction: willow sighs
willow: it's not that simple.
anya: shouldn't we stab him through the chest? isn't that what we do when these things happen?
willow: look, buffy knows what she's doing.
anya: well, xander, you know what we're all talking about. i mean, you've always been part of the "spike is evil" faction.
xander: i've got a house to put back together.
anya: fine. you guys keep your heads buried in the sand, but i think we should prepare ourselves for the possibility that william the bloody is back.

warren: all right.
scene direction: warren claps
warren: looking good. how do you feel?
andrew: good.
warren: excellent. we've got work to do.
andrew: i have to do work right now? can't i just walk around for a while in my coat?
warren: don't go soft on me now. we're right in the trench, and the exhaust port's in sight.
andrew: i thought that was it. i did what you told me. it's not my fault it didn't work. why do i have to do all the wet works?
scene direction: warren stops walking
warren: hey! you know the rules. i can't take corporeal form. here, feel.
scene direction: warren nods
warren: mm-hmm.
scene direction: andrew sticks hand through warren's chest
andrew: cool.
warren: pretty bitchin', right? i'm like obi wan?
andrew: or patrick swayze.
warren: believe me, i would do this stuff if i could. i can't. i need you. you're my iron fist.
scene direction: andrew sighs
andrew: i just don't think i can kill anybody else.
scene direction: andrew shrugs
scene direction: warren morphs into jonathan.
jonathan: oh, will you stop whining about that?
andrew: i didn't want to kill you. warren made me.
jonathan: hey, i'm glad he did.
scene direction: jonathan chuckles
jonathan: this is the best thing that's ever happened to me.
scene direction: andrew crosses arms
andrew: it didn't hurt too much? i-i'm not very good at stabbing.
jonathan: you know, it wasn't that bad. it was like a sharp pain, then a burning, then a general queasiness. it's kinda like when i used to get ulcers in high school, only at the end i became one with light and hope.
andrew: i can't do it. i can't do it anymore.
jonathan: hey, this isn't your fault, ok. it's my fault the ritual didn't work. i screwed up. i'm little—i-i don't have as much blood as other people. and i probably should've told someone i was anemic. don't worry. we're gonna fix it. you gotta trust us. we know what we're doing.
andrew: i can't kill anybody else.
jonathan: ok, calm down. we can work around that.

principal wood: now, guys, look, we can settle this one of two ways. you can repaint the walls, or i can suspend you and report this little incident on your permanent record.
punk #1: fine. do that.
principal wood: ok, i was bluffing. i hadn't really thought that one through.
scene direction: principal wood leans forward
principal wood: listen, this whole permanent record thing is such a myth anyway. colleges never ask for anything past your sat scores, and it's not like employers are gonna be calling up to check to see how many days you missed back in high school. so, listen, i-i could suspend you,
scene direction: principal wood stands, walks around desk
principal wood: but that would mean calling your parents, alerting your teachers, filling out paperwork, and, quite possibly, having to talk to the school board
scene direction: principal wood sits on desk in front of them
principal wood: all of which sounds positively exhausting to me. no. no, i think it would be much easier if i just called the police, let them deal with it.
scene direction: principal wood looks in their eyes
principal wood: oh, and, in case you're wondering, this is the part where i'm not bluffing.
scene direction: punk #2 looks at the other boy

scene direction: principal wood there's a knock at his door
principal wood: excuse me.

principal wood: oh, no.
dawn: yeah, last night she was vomiting, and then this morning she was vomiting some more, and then, just when we thought she was done, she was vomiting again.
scene direction: dawn laughs
principal wood: yeah, we got that stomach flu going around.
dawn: her exact words were, "i've got stuff coming out of both ends."
principal wood: thank you. that's very helpful.
scene direction: dawn smiles
dawn: sure. no problem.
scene direction: dawn to kids
dawn: hey, guys. how's it going?
punk #2: pretty good.
principal wood: um, tell your sister not to worry about it. we'll soldier on without her here. just, um, tell her to concentrate on getting better.
dawn: yeah, she'll be fine. she just needs to get some stuff out of her system.

scene direction: buffy matter-of-factly
buffy: no, we should probably try to wean him off humans. he'll have to make do with animal blood.
willow: i'll go get some.
buffy: you don't mind?
willow: no, i have to get out of the house. xander's installing the new windows, and he keeps giving lectures on proper tool maintenance. tool talk—not my thing.
buffy: thank you.
willow: how're you doing in there?
buffy: he's in pretty bad shape, past the point where he can tell me anything.
willow: i wasn't asking about him.

warren: you're conan. you're the destroyer. it's you against nature. you're the hunter, you're primal, you live off the land. you're andrew. everyone knows you. you play by your own rules. it's kill or be killed.
andrew: that'll do, pig!

scene direction: willow pushes him against the brick wall
willow: shut your mouth. i am a she-witch, a very powerful she-witch, or witch, as is more accurate. i'm not to be trifled with—

xander: no, in his head. it's a trigger. it's a brainwashing term. it's how the military makes sleeper agents. they-they brainwash operatives and condition them with a specific trigger, like a song, that makes 'em drastically change at a moment's notice.
willow: is this left over from your days in the army?
xander: no, this is left over from every army movie i've ever seen. but it makes sense. we've had ghosts or something haunting us, right? well, what if spike's ghosts have figured out a way to—not only haunt him—what if they figured out how to—how to control him?
buffy: spike said he's been seeing things since i found him in the basement.
willow: so, he gets his soul back, he starts seeing spooky things, and he goes extra-extra-crazy.
buffy: this trigger. how do we holster—safety, or—i don't know guns. how do we make it stop?
xander: well, usually the operative completes his task and either blows his head off or steals a submarine.
buffy: all right. i need information. if spike's a bomb, then i need to know how to diffuse him.
scene direction: buffy to dawn and willow
buffy: you two, i wanna know what did this to him. spirits, ghosts, demons—check the lot of them. look for anything that could haunt or-or possibly control like this. i need to know exactly what we're dealing with.

spike: did i hurt anybody?
buffy: you took a good bite out of andrew.
spike: who?
buffy: tucker's brother.
spike: oh.
buffy: he'll be ok.
spike: i don't remember.
buffy: it's ok.
scene direction: buffy stands, walks to sink
spike: buffy, i don't know why.
scene direction: buffy sighs
buffy: we think we do. something's playing you. some ghost or demon has figured out how to control you. got the gang researching it right now.
scene direction: buffy spike pulls himself up into sitting position using the chains
buffy: xander has this theory that you're being triggered.
spike: kill me.
scene direction: buffy turns to face him
buffy: what?
spike: buffy, you have to kill me.
buffy: you don't understand. when i left the room earlier, i heard you talking to someone—
spike: do you have any idea what i'm capable of?
buffy: i was in the cellar with you. i saw what you did.
spike: i'm not talking about the cellar. the people in the cellar got off easy. i'm talking about me. buffy, you have never met the real me.
scene direction: buffy crosses arms
buffy: believe me, i'm well aware of what you're capable of.
spike: no, you got off easy too.
scene direction: spike stands
spike: do you know how much blood you can drink from a girl before she'll die? i do. you see, the trick is to drink just enough to know how to damage them just enough so that they'll still cry when you—
scene direction: spike chokes up
spike: 'cause it's not worth it if they don't cry.
buffy: it's not your fault. you're not the one doing this.
spike: i already did it. it's already done.
scene direction: spike paces, then steps purposefully toward buffy
spike: you wanna know what i've done to girls dawn's age?
scene direction: spike beat
spike: this is me buffy. you've got to kill me before i get out.
buffy: we can keep you locked up. keep you here and we'll figure out—
spike: have you ever really asked yourself why you can't do it? off me? after everything i've done to you, to people around you. it's not love. we both know that.
buffy: you fought by my side. you've saved lives. you've helped—
spike: don't do that.
scene direction: spike rolls eyes
spike: don't rationalize this into some noble act. we both know the truth of it.
scene direction: spike looks down and away
spike: you like men who hurt you.
buffy: no.
scene direction: spike looks at buffy
spike: you need the pain we cause you. you need the hate. you need it to do your job, to be the slayer.
buffy: no. i don't hate like that. not you, or myself. not anymore. you think you have insight now because your soul's drenched in blood? you don't know me. you don't even know you. was that you who killed those people in the cellar? was that you who waited for those girls?
spike: there's no one else.
buffy: that's not true. listen to me. you're not alive because of hate or pain. you're alive because i saw you change. because i saw your penance.
scene direction: spike lunges violently at her, but chains hold him back
spike: window dressing.
buffy: be easier, wouldn't it, it if were an act, but it's not.
scene direction: buffy walks toward him
buffy: you faced the monster inside of you and you fought back. you risked everything to be a better man.
spike: buffy...
scene direction: buffy in his face
buffy: and you can be. you are. you may not see it, but i do. i do. i believe in you, spike.
scene direction: spike looks at her with a face full of hope and amazement. just then, the lights flicker and go out. someone bursts into the basement and pushes buffy away from spike. she falls to the ground.

scene direction: cut to 52 int. basement at sunnydale high - night
scene direction: close up of spike's face. shot so instruments of torture. a man is being strapped to a wood beam with a leather belt. spike is being strapped to a construct made of wood beams. spike/first is talking to him while a robed person, a priest of the first, also known as a harbinger, straps spike to the construct.
first [spike]: you'll have to excuse the spectacle, but i've always been a bit of a sucker for the old classics.
scene direction: first [spike] grins wickedly, fondly eyeing spike's predicament
scene direction: spike is tied to the wheel-like construct with all four corners of his body pulled in opposite directions. a harbinger takes out a knife and cuts spike with it. spike moans in excruciating pain.
spike: oh!
first [spike]: oh, don't look at me that way. i wanted to do this more subtle-like. my harbingers have a tendency to call attention to themselves.
scene direction: a harbinger cuts spike again.
spike: oh!
scene direction: first [spike] leans forward
first [spike]: you're the one who couldn't hold his end of the bargain. you're the one who couldn't take care of what's-his-name. you're the one who had to make breakthroughs and learn something about himself.
scene direction: a harbinger cuts spike again.
spike: oh!
first [spike]: so now, fittingly, you're the one who gets to do the honors.
scene direction: first [spike] crosses arms
scene direction: first [spike] morphs into buffy's form.
first [buffy]: i have to admit, i'm glad it worked out this way. i was going to bleed andrew, but
scene direction: first [buffy] sighs
first [buffy]: you look a lot better with your shirt off.
scene direction: a harbinger cranks a wheel attached to a mechanism that hoists the wheel spike's tied to into the air. spike is now hanging from the wheel about ten feet from the ground, bleeding steadily from his ritualized symbol-shaped cuts.
first [buffy]: to be honest, i'm getting a little tired of subtle. i think it's about time we brought some authority to our presence. now, spike, wanna see what a real vampire looks like?
scene direction: spike's blood is falling on the seal of danthazar that's right below him. it's pooling in the grooves and being absorbed into the seal. the seal starts to glow. one by one, the pointed tips of the pentagram at its center fold up, forming a pyramid. light comes out from under it. the pyramid sinks into the ground. the remaining pieces of the seal follow suit. spike glares at buffy/first, then watches the hole where the seal is. something sticks it's withered, gray, pointy-fingered hand out of the hole. a monster climbs out wearing black leather. pan up to show its horrible disfigured face. it's bald with a distinct vampire forehead and brows and trademark fanged teeth. it looks gaunt, with extremely hollow cheekbones. it raises its hands toward the sky and looks around the room, growling menacingly.
scene direction: closing credits.
