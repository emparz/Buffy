scene direction: shannon softly

scene direction: caleb shannon touches the passenger side door, trying to open it, but there's no handle

caleb: well, now, is this the part where you offer to do anything? because i tried to make it clear—you got nothin' i want to explore.
scene direction: caleb puts the lighter back in the dashboard and presses his heated ring into shannon's neck, making a sizzling sound. shannon screams.
caleb: oh yeah. that's it! that's a cleansing fire. hallelujah! now, if i'm not mistaken, there's a car a little ways behind us, and i do believe there's some folk in it goin' the same place you are. now, i want you to deliver a message for me, but it's not for them. it's for the other one—the one and only, the original, accept-no-substitutes slayer. would you tell her something for me?
scene direction: shannon frightened

scene direction: caleb shrugs
caleb: never did bring it up. suppose there was a reason why i never spent too long in one parish. just looking for answers. just looking for the lord in the wrong damn places.

scene direction: caleb looks at his outfit
caleb: everyone knows that.
first [buffy]: how do you like what i'm wearing?

first [buffy]: look hard. what do you see?
scene direction: caleb checks out the first's form
caleb: strength. and the loneliness that comes with real strength.

caleb: oh, yeah. yeah, she'll get the message.
first [buffy]: and what makes you so sure she'll come?

scene direction: cut to 36 int. sunnydale hospital - night
scene direction: shannon is bruised badly all over her body. she lies in bed, still, covered with bandages.
shannon: he was a minister, or something... at least, he dressed like one. i thought he was trying to save me...at first.
scene direction: pan over to show buffy and willow standing beside her bed.
buffy: he—he picked you up on the side of the road?
shannon: bringers were chasing me. he said they were his boys...right before he burned me.
scene direction: shannon removes the bandage over the burn on her neck. willow takes a digital camera out of her purse and snaps a picture of the burn.
shannon: he wanted to tell you something. before he...cut me...he told me to give the slayer a message.
buffy: what is it?
shannon: he said, "i have something of yours."

scene direction: buffy addresses a room full of potentials and the rest of the scooby gang.
buffy: we've got a new player in town. dresses like a preacher. calls himself caleb. looks like he's working for the first. he's taunting us, calling us out. says he's got something of mine. could be another girl, could be something else. don't know, don't care. i'm tired of talking. i'm tired of training. he's got something of mine? fine. i'm getting it back, and you guys are coming with me.

scene direction: caleb from the shadows
caleb: you're searching for something, girl. what would that be now?
helpless girl: oh.
scene direction: helpless girl smiles sweetly
helpless girl: you. i was looking for you.
caleb: is that right?
helpless girl: i heard you speakin' tonight. preachin'. i felt your words go straight to me.
caleb: well, the truth is like a sword, isn't it, girl? cuts deep.
scene direction: helpless girl smiles
helpless girl: yeah.
caleb: the words i use got a power to them.
scene direction: caleb paces
caleb: a power, now. they're not just words—they're truth.
scene direction: helpless girl leans back against a wine barrel
helpless girl: they brought me here.
caleb: they called you. you know why? because you're human.
scene direction: caleb walks around her
caleb: you got your urges. a woman's got hers. a man's got his. our whole race can be do damnably weak...
scene direction: caleb walks back toward the shadow
caleb: that's why we seek the strength, the power.
helpless girl: it's not wrong to be drawn to the power, is it, preacher?
scene direction: helpless girl follows him into the shadow
caleb: oh, no, child. it's not wrong...
scene direction: caleb the girl gasps and falls to the ground, revealing a bloody stomach wound
caleb: just human.
scene direction: the girl's body transforms into buffy's form.
scene direction: first [buffy] stands
first [buffy]: most people don't like visits from their dead, you know.
caleb: heathens. no appreciations for life's pleasures. do it again.
first [buffy]: i take requests.
scene direction: first [buffy] crosses arms
first [buffy]: one of those potentials you killed, perhaps?
caleb: no, save them for later. i'm in more of an old memory lane kind of mood. back before i met you, there was this choir girl in knoxville i used to give singing lessons to...why, she even screamed on key. show me her.
scene direction: first [buffy] shakes her head
first [buffy]: all these girls...they followed you willingly. you tricked them.
caleb: i only told them the truth. as for following, well, that seems to be what they do best.
scene direction: cut to 39 int. living room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: buffy has gathered the core of her team in the living room.
buffy: we need to start arming the girls. i wanna be ready to move when we find him.
willow: we don't even know where we're going.
buffy: 's why i figured we'd do a little recon first.
scene direction: buffy to faith
buffy: you up for it?
faith: point me where you want me.
giles: and you're certain this is the best course of action? you don't even know what this man has of yours—if he, in fact, has anything.
buffy: it could be a girl, a potential trying to get to us.
giles: could be a stapler.
buffy: going in anyway.
giles: with the girls? most of whom have yet to be in the field, let alone in a life or death situation.
buffy: then it's time we test them. look, i'll just take the ones that have been here the longest. the rest can stay behind.
spike: could be that's just what he wants you to do—the old bait-and-switch.
willow: yeah, he lures us away and then kills the girls we leave behind.
buffy: i know. that's why i need you to stay here with them. you're my most powerful weapon, will. i know you can keep them safe if anything happens.
xander: an unknown man breezes into town, says he has something of yours. buffy, this thing's got "trap" written all over it.
buffy: he won't be expecting a full attack—not this soon,
scene direction: buffy emphatically
buffy: that's why we have to move.
giles: we know nothing about this man. we cannot go into battle unprepared. we have to have more time.
buffy: giles, we don't have time. and you're not going into battle.
scene direction: buffy giles sighs
buffy: i need you to stay behind with the others. help the girls who still need a teacher.
scene direction: cut to 40 ext. forest - night
scene direction: buffy and faith are following a bringer, chatting as they go.
faith: no eyes, but look at him go. he got sonar or something?
buffy: or something, i guess. pretty good when they attack.
faith: do they just roam free around town?
buffy: well, normally, they show up out of nowhere, and then either stab or get stabbed, and then they run off. looks like this guy wants to be found.
faith: lends weight to the whole "it's a trap" theory.
scene direction: buffy snappily
buffy: i'm through waiting around for people to attack us.
faith: hey, i'm with you. drop me in the hornet's nest, what the hell? you got a rough sitch here, trying to turn a bunch of little girls into an army...
buffy: they're potential slayers, just like we were.
faith: right. maybe they'll do as good as us.
buffy: they're getting better.
faith: i'll work with 'em. some of 'em seem real eager. fashion disasters, yeah, but they're ready to fight.
scene direction: buffy stops walking
buffy: why did you come back?
faith: willow said you needed me. didn't give it a lot of thought. do you—am i getting you want me to be not here?
scene direction: buffy sighs
buffy: no, that's not what i meant. i'm...glad that you're here. it's good. thank you.
scene direction: buffy walks
faith: no problem. you know me. all about the good deeds.
buffy: willow said you helped out angel.
faith: yeah. he says "hi."
buffy: really.
faith: sure.
buffy: how is he?
faith: better. had to do this whole magical mind-walk with him.
buffy: you were in angel's mind?
faith: buffy...
scene direction: faith stops, looks at the barn-like building that the bringer walked up to
faith: what is this place?
buffy: look, there's more of them.
faith: i think we just found our hornet's nest.
buffy: let's get the cavalry.
scene direction: cut to 41 int. living room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: xander is holding a spiked baseball bat and talking to the potentials.
xander: now remember, we're looking for killing blows only, people.
scene direction: xander hands bat to rona
xander: so, chest and throat if it's a vampire. stomach, chest and face if it's a bringer.
rona: what if it's something else?
xander: could happen. something other-worldly. and here's a handy rule: don't go for the flashy tentacles just because they're waving 'em about trying to get attention. go for the center—
scene direction: xander points to each
xander: brains, heart, eyes. everything's got eyes.
dawn: except the bringers.
xander: except the bringers.
molly: i don't want there to be tentacles. i'm not good with squishy.
kennedy: i don't care if it's godzilla.
scene direction: kennedy raises a huge sword
kennedy: i want to get in this thing.
andrew: godzilla's mostly tokyo-based, so he's probably a no-show.
amanda: besides, if matthew broderick can kill godzilla, how tough is he?
scene direction: andrew whines
andrew: xander...
scene direction: andrew crosses his arms petulantly
xander: matthew broderick did not kill godzilla. he killed a big, dumb lizard. that was not the real godzilla.
rona: you people are even crazier than her.
xander: than who?
rona: buffy, man. i mean, taking us right into the bad guy's lair.
xander: well, that's where, generally speaking, you'd go to find the bad guy. and i don't think you came here to fight plaque.
rona: no, i came here for protection.
xander: well, you signed on to fight with—
rona: look, i know, but...
scene direction: rona sighs
rona: this plan is trouble. ok, buffy doesn't care how many of us she puts in danger—
xander: let me tell you something about buffy. in fact, you should all listen to this.
kennedy: uh, we kinda were.
xander: i've been through more battles with buffy than you all can ever imagine. she's stopped everything that's ever come up against her.
scene direction: xander buffy and faith walk through the front door and overhear xander's speech
xander: she's laid down her life—literally—to protect the people around her. this girl has died two times, and she's still standing. you're scared? that's smart. you got questions? you should. but you doubt her motives, you think buffy's all about the kill, then you take the little bus to battle.
scene direction: xander buffy tears up
xander: i've seen her heart, and this time—not literally. and i'm telling you, right now, she cares more about your lives than you will ever know. you gotta trust her. she's earned it.
scene direction: andrew and dawn are crying.
faith: damn. i never knew you were that cool.
scene direction: faith everyone turns to look at buffy and faith
buffy: well, you always were a little slow.
faith: i get that now.
buffy: all right, let's saddle up.
scene direction: cut to 42 ext. sh. valley vineyards - night
scene direction: buffy's brought a small gang with her to the vineyard—faith, spike, xander, kennedy, rona, molly, chao-ahn, amanda and another potential. they walk up to the front door, then buffy pauses to address the team.
buffy: ok. set up a perimeter. guard the door. i don't want anything getting in behind us. my team goes in first, we check the place out. you guys are our safety-net. if this place is a trap, we give the signal, you guys come in, guns a-blazing.
xander: so, what's the signal?
buffy: i'm thinking lots and lots of yelling.
xander: got it.
buffy: shall we?
scene direction: buffy leads a subset of the team inside.
scene direction: cut to 43 int. wine cellar at the shadow valley vineyards - night
scene direction: buffy walks down the steps into the wine cellar, followed by molly, kennedy, rona and chao-ahn.
scene direction: molly looking around
molly: what is this place?
buffy: looks like an old vineyard.
kennedy: an evil vineyard, huh?
spike: like falcon crest.
scene direction: buffy looking in the shadows
buffy: stay alert, you guys. bringers are here somewhere. just need to find out where.
spike: shouldn't be too hard.
scene direction: bringers come out of the shadows, from behind the barrels of wine, and attack buffy and gang. the fight is fairly even. suddenly, the bringers stop fighting and walk back into the shadows. caleb walks out into the light.
caleb: well, now, you girls are just burning with righteousness, aren't you? problem is, you think you're blazing like suns, when really you're burning like matchsticks in the face of the darkness. you having fun? now, i hope my boys haven't worn you out too much—i need you fit for when i purify you.
buffy: save the sermon, padre. i heard you have something of mine.
scene direction: caleb chuckles
caleb: well, i do now. you liked my little message, did you? you know, i ruined a perfectly good knife on that girl. got her soiled blood all over the place. i may have to get a new truck.
scene direction: caleb buffy looks taken aback
caleb: so, you're the slayer. the slayer. the strongest, the fastest, the most aflame with that most precious invention of all mankind—the notion of goodness. the slayer must indeed be powerful.
scene direction: caleb with one powerful punch, he sends buffy flying across the room
caleb: so, what else you got?
scene direction: caleb looks around smugly
scene change: fade to black.
scene change: *** act iv ***
scene direction: cut to 44 int. wine cellar at the shadow valley vineyards - night
scene direction: resume. caleb has knocked buffy across the room.
scene direction: spike vamps out and attacks caleb. caleb pushes him down with ease. spike tries to get up, but caleb head-butts him, then throws him across the room into a huge wine storage tank that busts when spike hits it. wine pours out of the tank and washes spike across the floor. kennedy and the other potentials get into gear and join the fight.
kennedy: let's go!
scene direction: the bringers come back out of the shadows to fight the potentials as well. kennedy storms caleb but has to engage a bringer instead. caleb punches kennedy, knocking her into a stack of wine barrels.
scene direction: rona worried
rona: kennedy!
scene direction: rona runs toward kennedy, but caleb cuts her off. she swings the spiked baseball bat at caleb, but he catches it and looks her in the eyes.
scene direction: caleb to rona
caleb: miss, i do believe you have your own problems you should be worrying about.
scene direction: caleb breaks rona's arm with ease, sending her reeling back in agony. caleb chuckles and bends to pick up a knife from the floor. he tosses the knife to a nearby bringer, who swings it back ready to plunge it into rona's body. an arrow pierces the bringer's forearm as he rears back. they turn to look, and see xander standing there with a bow. faith's there beside him. the bringer leaves rona and fights with xander.
caleb: oh, good. there's more of you.
scene direction: faith charges at caleb. xander sees buffy lying unconscious against the wall where she fell when caleb threw her.
xander: buffy!
scene direction: xander runs to buffy, fighting off bringers on his way to her side. holding a knife in each hand, faith engages caleb in a fight, but she's not seeming to faze him.
scene direction: caleb looks faith up and down
caleb: well, you're the other one, aren't you. your cain to her abel.
scene direction: caleb faith throws a knife at caleb
caleb: no offense meant to cain, of course.
scene direction: faith attacks caleb with her other knife, but he grabs her arm, twists it, and crosses it with her other arm in a fashion such that she can't move, but is looking right at him. he squeezes her hands until she's forced to drop the knife. faith grunts at him and knees him in the crotch, causing caleb to let go of her just enough that she can escape his grasp. she backhands him across the face.
scene direction: faith through gritted teeth
faith: never was much for the good book.
scene direction: caleb grabs faith's arm and twists it painfully behind her back, causing her to double over. she falls to her knees as he twists and pulls her arm and walks around to the front of her.
caleb: oh, it has its moments. paul had some good stuff, for instance. but overall i find it a tad complicated
scene direction: caleb slaps faith
caleb:  i like to keep things simple.
scene direction: caleb kicks faith across the room into a stack of wine barrels
caleb: good folk, bad folk,
scene direction: caleb a potential with long black hair swings at caleb, but he grabs her sword, then her face
caleb: clean folk, dirty folk...
scene direction: caleb snaps the potential's neck and drops her to the ground.
scene direction: molly seeing caleb kill the potential
molly: no...!
caleb: yes.
scene direction: caleb walks toward molly
scene direction: xander is at buffy's side as she recovers and gets back into the game.
scene direction: buffy weakly trying to sit up
buffy: xander, get them out of here. we have to retreat. do it.
scene direction: xander leaves. caleb walks menacingly toward molly, who backs up slowly, frozen with fear. she raises her arm back to stab him, but he grabs her wrist, then her neck. another potential fights a bringer. a bringer throws amanda against a wall and attacks her. buffy stands just as caleb squeezes molly's neck, lifting her off the floor. buffy tries to go to her, but bringers keep attacking her, slowing her down.
scene direction: caleb to molly
caleb: what can i say? i work in mysterious ways.
scene direction: caleb stabs molly, lets go of her neck, dropping her to the ground
caleb: also some fairly straightforward ones.
scene direction: enraged at seeing what he did to molly, buffy rushes caleb. she fights him more evenly this time, avoiding his punches, and landing a few of her own. she punches him so hard, caleb is sent flying across the room.
scene direction: spike grabs buffy's arm
spike: we're all leaving.
scene direction: spike pulls buffy away from the fight. xander goes to kennedy's side.
scene direction: xander to kennedy
xander: are you ok?
scene direction: xander kennedy nods
xander: let's go. come on.
scene direction: xander helps kennedy to her feet. spike escorts rona out of the building.
scene direction: xander waving to the others
xander: let's go! come on!
scene direction: caleb grabs xander and turns him around so he's facing caleb.
caleb: you're the one who sees everything, aren't you?
scene direction: caleb rears his hand back in front of xander's face
caleb: well, let's see what we can't do about that.
scene direction: caleb plunges his thumb into xander's left eye, gouging it out. xander screams in agony. spike charges caleb, knocking xander away from caleb. xander, bleeding from his eye, stumbles back, falling to the ground in front of wine barrels.
scene direction: buffy goes to xander's side
buffy: xander! come on.
scene direction: buffy and spike lift xander to his feet, and carry him out, one supporting each of his arms. caleb sits up but doesn't pursue them as they walk out. he stands and smiles while watching them leave.
scene direction: cut to 45 int. sunnydale hospital - night
scene direction: buffy walks through the hospital, past the beds of her friends who were hurt tonight. past rona and the other potentials, to xander's bed where willow sits at his side, holding his hand.
caleb v.o.: now, it's a simple story. stop me if you've heard it. i have found and truly believe that there is nothing so bad it cannot be made better with a story.
scene direction: buffy just stares at xander, his head and his eye bandaged.
caleb v.o.: and this one's got a happy ending.

scene direction: cut to 48 int. street in sunnydale - night
scene direction: walking alone, her arms crossed, buffy walks down a desolate street at night looking forlorn and troubled.
caleb v.o.: but this woman, she was filled with darkness, despair, and why? because she did not know. she could not see.
scene direction: cut to 49 int. wine cellar at the shadow valley vineyards - night
scene direction: caleb is talking to first [buffy] in the cellar.

scene direction: cut to 50 int. street in sunnydale - night
scene direction: walking alone, her arms crossed, buffy walks down a desolate street at night looking forlorn and troubled.
