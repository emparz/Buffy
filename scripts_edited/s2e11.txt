scene direction: buffy's street at night. willow and xander are walking ahead of her on their way to her house.
xander: you don't know what you're talking about.
willow: xander, he was obviously in charge.
xander: he was a puppet! she was using him!
willow: he didn't seem like the type of guy who would let himself be used.
xander: well, that was her genius! he didn't even know he was playing second fiddle.
scene direction: xander turns behind him
xander: buffy.
buffy: huh?
xander: who was the real power? the captain, or tennille?
buffy: ummm... who are these people?
xander: the captain and tennille? boy, somebody was raised in a culture-free environment!
buffy: i'm sorry. i was just...
willow: thinking?
buffy: no, not thinking. having a lot of happy non-thoughts. i love it when things are quiet around here.
xander: yeah, with spike and drusilla out of the way, we've really been ridin' the mellow, and i am really jinxing the hell out of us by saying that.
buffy: yeah, but we'll let you off this time.
scene direction: they turn down the walk to buffy's house.
willow: so, we're pretty sure that there're not more tarakan assassins coming our way?
buffy: angel's sources say the contract's off.
xander: how *is* angel? pretend i care.
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: getting better.
willow: and you're loving playing nursemaid?
buffy: oh, yeah!
xander: so, is it better than playing naughty stewardess?
buffy: xander...
scene direction: he chuckles as they climb the steps to the porch. buffy gets out her key and reaches up to put it in the door lock. when she pushes on it to insert it the door just swings in. cut inside. buffy stares in, concerned to find the door unlocked.
buffy: you guys wait here a second.
scene direction: she slowly walks in and looks around. after a few seconds she hears a glass fall and break in the kitchen and her mother cry out.
scene direction: joyce from the kitchen
joyce: no!
scene direction: buffy rushes through the dining room to the kitchen door and pushes it open.
buffy: mom!
scene direction: there she catches her mother locked in an embrace with and kissing a man. they break off their kiss, and all three of them stare awkwardly at each other.
buffy: oh, my...
scene direction: buffy exhales
buffy: i'm sorry, i...
scene direction: buffy exhales
buffy: i heard...
joyce: uh, i-i-i broke a wineglass. y-y-you're home early.
ted: hi.
buffy: hi.
scene direction: joyce to ted
joyce: oh! uh, this is my daughter, buffy.
scene direction: joyce to buffy
joyce: buffy, this is ted.
scene direction: buffy just stares at him, unsure how to react.
scene direction: opening credits roll. buffy's theme plays.
scene change: *** part 1 ***
scene direction: the kitchen at buffy's house. xander and willow have been invited to stay for dinner. ted is cooking. he opens the oven and slides in a baking sheet full of mini pizzas.
ted: okay, here we go!
scene change: cut to outside the kitchen door. joyce empties the dustpan full of broken glass into the trashcan.
buffy: so. all these late nights at the gallery recently i gather you were cataloging more than art.
joyce: well, i... i've been looking for the right moment to introduce you two. he's a wonderful man.
scene direction: buffy looks over her shoulder at ted cooking.
ted: sprinkle that on...
xander: uh, a little more. okay, more...
buffy: how'd you meet?
joyce: oh, he sells, uh, computer software. he redid my entire system at the gallery, freed up a lot of my time.
buffy: to meet new people. and smooch them in my kitchen.
joyce: you weren't supposed to see that.
scene direction: cut inside the kitchen. ted takes the cast-iron pan from the stove, goes over to the island with it and scoops out several finished pizzas.
willow: i like my new nine-gig hard drive.
ted: but you don't love it, 'cause without the dma upgrade your computer's only half a rocket ship.
willow: yeah, but who can afford the upgrades?
ted: well, you can! i get the demos for free, i don't see why i shouldn't give 'em to you for the same price! any friend of buffy's...
scene direction: willow squeals with delight. xander munches on one of the mini pizzas.
ted: what?
xander: oh, that's the sound she makes when she's speechless with geeker joy. can i just say, this is the finest pizza *ever* on god's green earth. what is your secret?
ted: well, after you bake it, you fry it in herbs and olive oil, but you gotta use
scene direction: ted knocks his pan
ted: a cast-iron skillet. no room for compromise there.
scene direction: buffy and joyce come back into the kitchen.
xander: y'know, you should market these things. i mean, you can get two, three hundred bucks apiece!
scene direction: ted laughs at that and takes the plate with the pizzas over to buffy.
ted: hungry?
buffy: no, thanks.
ted: buffy, i want to apologize. that wasn't how i wanted us to meet. i wanted it to be... perfect. i'm very fond of your mother, i guess that's pretty obvious. i know you're the most
scene direction: ted gestures toward the picture of the two of them on the refrigerator
ted: important thing in her life, and, well, gosh, that makes you pretty important to me, too.
scene direction: joyce overheard and comes over to stand next to ted.
joyce: buffy, i really want you to be okay with this.
ted: beg to differ: *we* really want you to be okay with this.
scene direction: they both smile at buffy.
buffy: i'm okay.
joyce: you are?
buffy: i am.
scene direction: buffy smiles stiffly
scene change: cut to the park. a picnic table stands there empty. suddenly a vampire comes crashing down onto it, and it collapses underneath him. he shakes off the blow as he gets back up and comes at buffy again. she grabs the metal lid from a trashcan while giles looks on. she uses it as a shield to block the vampire's punch and then hits him over the head with it. he falls to his knee, but gets back up. she hits him with it again and he falls to his other knee and quickly gets up again. she hits him a third time and he staggers again.
giles: buffy? i-i believe he's, he's, um...
scene direction: buffy swings down with the lid from above onto the vampire's head. he just absorbs the blow and comes at her with a punch. she blocks the swing with the lid again and swings it around onto his head from above again. giles winces at what he's seeing. buffy blocks another punch, then discards the lid and kicks the vampire in the face.
giles: it, it's, it's staking time, really. don't you think?
scene direction: buffy kicks the vampire again and follows up with a punch to the jaw.
scene direction: giles sits down on a bench to wait, holding his bag in his lap. buffy throws a right jab to the vampire's face. she follows up with a kick to his knee, making the vampire fall to the ground. she pulls a stake out of her jacket and cleanly jams it into his chest and pulls it back out.
scene direction: the vampire bursts into ashes. buffy looks around as she walks over to giles.
buffy: any others?
giles: well, for their sakes, i certainly hope not.
buffy: what? i kill vampires, that's my job.
giles: well, true, true, although you don't usually beat them into quite such a bloody pulp beforehand. everything alright?
buffy: yeah! fine!
scene direction: she walks around him, steps up onto the bench and sits on the backrest.
buffy: i killed a vampire here on wednesday. why are they hanging out at the park?
giles: well, they're... scattered, you know. now their leaders are gone, with any luck dead. in times of crisis they usually return to the easiest feeding grounds.
buffy: vampires are creeps.
giles: yes, that's why one slays them.
buffy: i mean, people are perfectly happy getting along, and then vampires come, and they run around and they kill people, and they take over your whole house, they start making these stupid little mini pizzas, and everyone's like, 'i like your mini pizzas,' but i'm telling you, i am...
scene direction: giles interrupts
giles: uh, uh, buffy! i-i believe the... subtext here is, is, rapidly becoming, uh,
scene direction: giles clears his throat
giles: uh, text. are you sure there's nothing you want to share?
buffy: no. forget it.
scene direction: buffy looks around again
buffy: think there'll be anymore? i-i can wait.
scene change: cut to sunnydale high the next day.
buffy: if you say one more word, things will become dire.
scene change: cut to the halls. xander, willow and buffy are walking.
xander: did you even bother to taste 'em? nooo! well, i did, and i'm here to tell ya those mini pizzas have changed my life! ted is the master chef!
buffy: fine! so he's a good cook. well, what does that really tell you about a person?
xander: everything.
willow: you don't like him?
buffy: i don't *know* him. i, i mean, so far all i see is someone who apparently has a good job, seems nice and polite, and my mother really likes him.
scene direction: xander in a rough voice
xander: what kind of a monster is he?
buffy: i'm just saying there's something a little too clean about this clown.
scene direction: willow giggles
willow: he's a clean clown!
scene direction: willow gets stares from the others
willow: i have my own fun.
scene direction: they arrive at the vending machines.
xander: buff, you're lacking evidence. i think maybe we're in sigmund freud territory.
scene direction: he puts his coins into the machine.
willow: he has a point. separation anxiety, the mother figure being taken away, conflict with the father figure...
buffy: he's *not* my father figure.
xander: having issues much?
buffy: i am not!
scene direction: xander does a typical funny dance, pointing both fingers at buffy and responding in a sing-song voice.
xander: you're having parental issues, you're having parental issues...
willow: xander...
xander: what? freud would've said the exact same thing. except he might not have done that little dance.
buffy: okay, i admit it's weird. seeing my mother frenching a guy is definitely a ticket to therapy land, but it's more than that. i'm pretty good at sensing what's going on around me, and there is definitely something wrong with this... ted.
scene direction: xander spots ted coming down the stairs behind buffy.
xander: ted!
buffy: of course, ted. who'd you think i was talking about?
xander: hi, ted! ted, who's here.
ted: hello, kids!
scene direction: the girls turn quickly to face him.
scene direction: buffy to ted
buffy: what are you doing here?
ted: i'm updating the software in the guidance office. which reminds me,
scene direction: ted pulls several disks from his pocket and hands them to willow
ted: your upgrades.
scene direction: willow eagerly accepting the disks
willow: oh, what a day! thank you!
scene direction: buffy gives willow a look.
ted: think nothing of it. buffy, do you like miniature golf?
xander: who doesn't!
ted: well, your mother and i were thinking maybe this saturday we could drag the three of you out to the course, spend some time swinging the iron with the stuffy old people.
buffy: well, uh...
ted: i'm making a picnic basket.
scene direction: xander eyes wide
xander: with mini pizzas?
ted: and cookies!
scene direction: xander inhales in wide-eyed, open-mouthed rapture.
buffy: you know what, we, we would love to, honestly, but, um, unfortunately we have that
scene direction: buffy looks to willow for support
buffy: thing on saturday.
willow: ohhh, that thing.
scene direction: willow they look at xander
willow: that thing.
xander: hey, we can do that thing anytime. i'm tired of doing that thing.
scene direction: xander to ted
xander: we're on!
ted: great!
scene direction: willow and buffy can only smile, willow widely, buffy half-heartedly.
scene change: cut to ms. calendar's classroom. she's gathering assignments from the desks. giles walks up to the door and steps in.
giles: hello, jenny.
jenny: rupert. hi.
giles: some of your, uh, textbooks were delivered to the library. um, do you want me to, uh, hang on to them?
jenny: yeah, that's fine. i'll send the kids by to pick 'em up.
giles: right. good.
scene direction: giles turns around and starts out of the room
jenny: pretty flimsy excuse for coming by to see me.
scene direction: giles comes back in
giles: you should have heard the ones i threw out.
scene direction: giles smiles briefly
giles: i just, i wanted to, uh... see how you were doing.
jenny: i'm doing pretty good, actually. i've stayed out of mortal danger for three whole weeks. i could get used to it.
scene direction: jenny giles smiles at that
jenny: i'm still having trouble sleeping, though.
scene direction: giles steps closer
giles: oh, of course. um... you, you, you need time.
jenny: or possibly space. rupert, i know you're concerned. but having you constantly poking around, making little puppy dog eyes at me, wondering if i'm okay...
scene direction: jenny exhales
jenny: you make me feel bad that i don't feel better. i don't want that responsibility.
giles: sorry.
scene direction: giles looks down
giles: i certainly don't mean to make, um, 'dog eyes'... at you. i'm just...
jenny: worried. i know.
giles: i shouldn't have bothered you.
scene direction: he turns and walks out of the room with his head hung down. jenny watches him go and exhales. she goes back to collecting the papers.
scene change: cut to angel's apartment. buffy is replacing the bandage on his right hand while he lies in his comfy chair.
buffy: so mom's like, 'do you think ted will like this?' and 'this is ted's favorite show,' and 'ted's teaching me computers,' and 'ted said the funniest thing,' and i'm like, 'that's really great, mom,' and then she said i was being sarcastic, which i was, but i'm sorry if i don't wanna talk about ted all the time.
scene direction: angel looks up at her
angel: so, you gonna talk about something else at some point?
buffy: i'm sorry. i just have so much to deal with, i don't need some new guy in my life.
scene direction: she's finished wrapping the bandage and angel hands her a piece of tape.
angel: no, but maybe your mom does.
scene direction: buffy takes the tape and puts it on the bandage.
buffy: well, sure, if you're gonna use wisdom.
scene direction: angel chuckles
angel: loneliness is about the scariest thing there is.
buffy: okay, so my mom needs a guy in her life. does it have to be ted?
angel: do you have somebody else in mind? there's a guy out there that would satisfy you?
buffy: my dad?
scene direction: buffy angel looks at her
buffy: yeah, okay, that's not gonna happen. fine, fine, i'll give ted a chance. i'll play mini-golf, and i'll smile and curtsy and be the dutiful daughter. do i have to like him?
scene direction: angel smiles
angel: kiss me.
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: finally, something i wanna do!
scene direction: she leans over him and kisses him lightly on the lips. she gets in his lap and they kiss more passionately.
scene change: cut to saturday at the mini-golf course. the group walks up to the next hole.
xander: ah, the dreaded five-par cuckoo clock. ha! so many have come, so few have conquered.
scene direction: he puts his ball in place and studies his shot.
joyce: that picnic was delicious.
scene direction: xander takes his shot. it's weak.
joyce: you know how rare it is to find a man that cooks?
ted: i know i've been looking a long time for one. so, buffy, i bet the boys are lined up around the block tryin' to get a date with you.
buffy: not really.
willow: oh, they are, but she's only interested in...
scene direction: willow gets a nudge from buffy
willow: uh, her studies! 'book-cracker buffy', it's kind of her nickname.
ted: well, glad to hear it. i bet that means your grades will be picking up soon.
scene direction: he bends down to position his ball for his shot.
buffy: my grades?
scene direction: buffy paces over to her mom
buffy: how does he know about my grades?
joyce: i told him. he wants to know everything about you. he's concerned. that's a good thing.
scene direction: joyce ted makes his shot
joyce: ooo, nice shot, ted!
scene change: cut to the next hole with a castle. buffy is ready to take her shot.
ted: keep your eye on the ball. watch those elbows!
scene direction: buffy swings a bit too hard, and the ball ricochets off of the castle and into the rough behind it.
ted: oh! bad luck, little lady!
scene direction: buffy starts to walk to retrieve her ball for another try.
joyce: oh, we won't count it.
ted: we won't?
scene direction: buffy stops and turns back to look at them.
joyce: well, it's just miniature golf.
ted: it is, but the rules are the rules. and what we teach her is what she takes out into the world when we're not there, whether it's at school or an unchaperoned party.
scene direction: ted to buffy
ted: i don't mean to overstep my bounds, this is between you and your mother, i just think right is right.
joyce: he has a point.
buffy: fine. i'll just go hit my ball from the rough.
scene direction: she goes over to her ball behind the castle and picks it up. she steps onto the green, and thinking no one sees her drops her ball into the hole.
scene direction: buffy loudly
buffy: hey, how 'bout that! got a hole in two!
ted: beg to differ.
scene direction: buffy turns her head to see him standing next to the castle where he can just see.
buffy: okay, so fine my score or whatever.
ted: i think you're missing the point here, little lady. right is right, wrong is wrong. why don't people see that?
buffy: it's just a game?
ted: right, it's just a game, do your own thing, well, i'm not wired that way. and i am here to tell you
scene direction: ted buffy notices how he's tapping his ankle with his club pretty hard
ted: it is *not* a game! it *does* count, and i don't stand for that kind of malarkey in my house!
buffy: then i guess it's a good thing i'm not *in* your house.
ted: do you want me to slap that smart-ass mouth of yours?
scene direction: buffy can't believe her ears. she notices the others come around the castle, and ted follows her gaze.
ted: who's up for dessert? i made chocolate-chip cookies!
scene direction: ted smiles
scene direction: joyce opens the zip-lock bag of cookies.
xander: yum-my!
willow: cookies!
scene direction: buffy stares at everyone and can't believe that ted just threatened her.
ted: yeah! i-i made, uh, too many, so you guys are gonna have to take some home!
scene direction: everyone has a cookie and is munching away.
joyce: mm! buffy, you've got to try one of these! they're really good! mm!
scene direction: ted offers her one with a smile. buffy just keeps looking at them in disbelief.
willow: mm!
xander: mm! these are tasty!
scene change: *** part 2 ***
scene change: morning at the summer's house. cut to the kitchen. buffy comes wandering in. joyce gets the orange juice from the refrigerator and brings it to the island.
joyce: good morning, sunshine!
buffy: hey.
scene direction: joyce sets down the oj
joyce: i've got juice, i've got sticky buns, oh, don't they smell good!
scene direction: buffy picks up part of a bun.
joyce: ted made them.
scene direction: buffy puts it back down.
scene direction: joyce smiles
joyce: what?
buffy: i'd just like to eat something around here that ted didn't make.
joyce: oh, what kind of an attitude is that?
scene direction: buffy exhales
buffy: look, mom, i know you think he's great and all, but i...
scene direction: joyce pours some juice
joyce: y'know, he went out of his way to be nice to you, and you couldn't say two words to him on saturday.
scene direction: joyce pours another glass
joyce: i do not expect you to love him right away like i do, but i do expect you to treat him decently.
buffy: you love him?
scene direction: joyce puts down the juice carton
joyce: i-i don't know.
scene direction: joyce exhales
joyce: that just slipped out.
scene direction: joyce takes the juice back to the fridge
joyce: but i guess, i mean, it's not exactly like men beat down the door when you're a single...
buffy: when you're a single parent.
scene direction: joyce exhales
joyce: honey, look. i wouldn't have anything to do with anybody if they didn't care about you. but he does! i don't understand why you can't see that!
buffy: he threatened me.
joyce: what?
scene direction: joyce comes back to the island
buffy: he threatened me. he said that he was gonna slap my face.
scene direction: joyce disbelieving
joyce: he said no such thing! honey, ted told me what happened. he caught you cheating, didn't he?
scene direction: buffy exhales
buffy: yeah, i kicked my ball in, put me in jail, but he totally wigged!
joyce: and he didn't say anything about it in front of the others, did he?
buffy: uh, no, but i don't think that's the...
scene direction: joyce interrupts
joyce: well, i thought that that was pretty decent of him! ted said we are just gonna have to give you time to come around. oh, speaking of which, he's making dinner for us tonight, so i'd like you at home, please,
scene direction: joyce points down for emphasis
joyce: promptly at six.
scene direction: buffy gives her mother a look and stalks out of the kitchen. joyce just shrugs and lets her go. she eats part of a sticky bun.
joyce: mm, this is sooo delicious!
scene change: cut to the quad at the school. willow, buffy and xander are walking across. xander is munching on a cookie.
willow: what do you mean, check him out?
buffy: i mean investigate him. find out his secrets, hack into his life.
xander: can you say 'overreaction'?
buffy: can you say 'sucking chest wound'?
willow: buffy, it just seems like you *want* him to be corrupt, or something.
buffy: the guy lost his senses over mini-golf.
xander: so he's a little uptight. last i heard that's not a slaying offense.
scene direction: xander gets a look from buffy
xander: don't gimme the look, i'm on your side. i'm just saying there are some things in life you have to accept.
scene direction: buffy and willow sit on a bench.
buffy: and i'm saying ted ain't one of 'em.
scene direction: xander notices cordelia walk past them behind the bench.
xander: hey, cordy! nice outfit.
scene direction: cordelia stops to look at him
cordelia: oh, very funny.
xander: not really.
cordelia: what are you saying?
scene direction: buffy and willow look up at xander.
xander: nice outfit?
cordelia: well, why don't you just keep your mouth shut!
scene direction: cordelia walks off
xander: would you guys excuse me for a sec?
scene direction: xander goes after cordelia
willow: what's up with them?
scene change: cut to cordelia walking along the colonnade. xander catches up with her.
cordelia: what's wrong with you?
xander: i gave you a compliment.
cordelia: in front of your friends! they're gonna know!
xander: know what?
cordelia: please! it's too traumatic for me to even say it!
xander: that we kissed?
cordelia: uhhh!
xander: look, i'm not gonna tell, they're not gonna know. not your friends, not my friends. you wanna go to the utility closet and make out?
cordelia: god! is that all you ever think about?
scene direction: cordelia considers the offer
scene direction: okay.
scene change: they go off to make out. cut to buffy and willow still on the bench.
buffy: will, i'm not wrong here. ted has a problem with me. he acts like i'm in the way or something. and mom's been totally different since he's around.
willow: different, like happy?
buffy: like stepford. will you help me?
willow: you know i will. what do you want me to look for?
buffy: let's start small. can you find out where he works?
scene direction: willow nods.
scene change: cut to ted's office. buffy spots ted at his desk and moves into the snack area to observe him. neal has the desk next to ted's. they're both talking with customers over their headsets.
neal: yeah, i-i-it's a terrific product. no pc should be without it.
ted: no, mrs. lawnsdale, it is not an inexpensive piece of software. as a matter of fact it's a very expensive one. which removes the risk of crashing your whole system. of course, if you prefer something cheap, i can always recommend... trust me, you won't be sorry. thank *you* very much.
scene direction: ted takes off his headset and puts it down. buffy sees him get up and quickly crouches down and hides under the snack table. ted walks over to the sales board and makes another hack mark by his name.
ted: goin' to lunch!
scene direction: he walks out the door. buffy stands back up and watches him leave. she glances over at his desk and then back at the sales board again. neal walks up to get a cup of coffee and notices her standing there.
neal: you're new, aren't ya?
scene direction: neal grabs the coffee pot
buffy: oh...
neal: i'm neal.
scene direction: neal pours a cup
buffy: i'm b... linda. belinda. i'm just temping for the day.
scene direction: buffy looks at the board
buffy: wow, that guy's a salesman. i guess he's the one to beat around here.
neal: nobody beats 'the machine'. the guy's a genius. knows everything about computers, never loses a client... if i sound bitter, i am.
scene direction: neal takes a sip of his coffee
buffy: well, nobody likes an overachiever.
scene direction: buffy neal chuckles
buffy: uh, he's probably got ex-wives and, and families to support.
neal: he's just got a girlfriend. i'm amazed he let her clutter his desk.
scene direction: he looks at ted's desk and buffy follows his gaze. there's a single picture frame on it beside the computer and nothing else.
neal: thank god he's taking off for the wedding.
scene direction: buffy surprised
buffy: the wedding?
neal: yeah, he's got it set for two months from now. believe me, i am counting the days.
scene direction: neal spots his boss
neal: uh-oh, the ueber-boss. back to the salt mines.
scene direction: neal walks off
scene direction: buffy casually makes her way to ted's desk, looking around to see if anyone notices her. she looks at the picture, and it strikes her as familiar. she takes it, opens up the back and pulls it out. she notices it's folded, and when she unfolds it she sees it's the picture of her and her mother from their refrigerator at home with her own face folded back.
scene change: cut to dinner at home. buffy, joyce and ted are seated at the dining room table. ted is saying grace.
ted: we thank you for what we are about to receive, and we ask that you bless this house, and help the people in it to be more productive, more considerate and more honest. amen.
joyce: amen.
scene direction: ted and joyce lay their napkins in their laps. joyce takes up her fork and starts in.
ted: well, another great day at work! how was school today, buffy? did you learn anything?
buffy: quite a bit.
ted: good for you! well, joycie, what do you think?
joyce: i think every home should have one of you. it's fantastic!
scene direction: joyce smiles
scene direction: joyce to buffy
joyce: don't you think?
scene direction: ted smiles over at buffy.
buffy: looks good.
ted: well, you know, little lady, it's not just for looks, it's for building strong bodies.
scene direction: buffy just sits there staring at ted.
scene direction: joyce looks at buffy
joyce: honey?
buffy: are you two engaged?
scene direction: ted raises his head in realization.
joyce: goodness, no! whatever gave you that idea?
ted: now, joycie, let me handle this. buffy, your mother and i are taking it one step at a time. and if things go the way i hope, maybe someday soon i just might ask her to tie the knot. how would you feel about that?
scene direction: ted silence from buffy
ted: it's okay to have feelings, buffy, and it's okay to express them.
buffy: i'd feel like killing myself.
joyce: buffy!
ted: no, no, i, i told her to be honest.
scene direction: ted to buffy
ted: sweetheart, you should try and get used to me, 'cause you know what? i'm not going anywhere.
scene direction: buffy to joyce
buffy: may i be excused?
joyce: you can go to your room, young lady, that's where you can go.
scene direction: buffy gets up and leaves the table without another word.
joyce: ted, i
scene direction: joyce exhales
joyce: i am so embarrassed! i-i-i don't know what's wrong with her!
ted: joycie,
scene direction: ted takes her hand
ted: you don't get to be salesman of the year by giving up after a couple of rejections. she'll come 'round.
scene direction: he smiles at her and takes his glass for a sip.
scene change: cut to the park. buffy is sitting on a swing, tapping a stake in her hand, hoping some vampires will show up.
buffy: vampires... here, vampires...
scene direction: she exhales, frustrated that she can't work out her anger, and decides to head home. cut inside her room. she climbs up to her window and crawls in. inside she finds ted waiting in a chair for her to come home.
buffy: what are you doing in here?
ted: your mother told you to go to your room, buffy. you and i both know she didn't mean climb out a window and go gallivanting about town.
buffy: first of all, this is *my* room, second...
scene direction: buffy sees her slayer stuff lying on her desk
buffy: you've been going through my things?
ted: yes, i have.
buffy: that's my personal property! how *dare* you?!
ted: i don't see how it's any different from you snooping around my office, do you?
scene direction: ted raises her diary and reads
ted: what exactly is a vampire slayer?
buffy: it's none of your business.
ted: beg to differ, little lady. everything you do is nothing *but* my business from now on.
buffy: i think you better get out of here. now!
ted: or what?
scene direction: ted stands up and steps toward her
ted: you'll slay me? i'm real. i'm not some goblin you made up in your little diary. psychiatrists have a word for something like this - delusional. so, from now on, you'll do what i say, when i say, or i show this
scene direction: ted holds up her diary
ted: to your mother, and you'll spend your best dating years behind the wall of a mental institution. your mother and i are going to be happy. you're not going to stand in the way. sleep tight!
scene direction: he starts to leave the room, and opens the door to go out. buffy follows him and grabs hold of his hand that has her diary.
buffy: that's mine, and you are *not* leaving this room with it!
ted: take your hand off me.
buffy: no.
scene direction: ted slaps her hard, almost punching her, and makes her hit the wall.
buffy: ohhh!
scene direction: buffy straightens back up to face him
buffy: i was *so* hoping you'd do that.
scene direction: she punches him squarely in the jaw, and he staggers back into the open door. he pushes himself upright and backhands her in the face, making her fall against the side of her bed and onto the floor. he picks her up by the shirt collar, but she kicks him in the shin. joyce comes to the door to see what all the noise is about.
joyce: buffy! stop that!
scene direction: buffy elbows him in the face.
joyce: stop it!
scene direction: buffy kicks him in the chest, making him stagger backward out into the hall, where joyce has to quickly move out of the way. buffy follows him into the hall and punches him in the face again. ted trips down to the end of the hall before regaining his balance, and buffy is there to kick him again. he spins around and falls down the stairs, tumbling to the bottom. when he hits the floor his neck sounds like it has broken. joyce comes running down the stairs after him.
joyce: ted...
scene direction: she kneels next to him and tries to shake him awake.
joyce: ted! ted!
scene direction: buffy slowly descends the stairs. joyce takes ted's arm to feel for a pulse. when she doesn't find one she drops his arm and looks up at buffy.
joyce: you killed him!
scene direction: buffy stares down at ted's unmoving body, not believing what just happened.
scene change: *** part 3 ***
scene direction: the foyer at the summers house. ted's body is zipped up into a body bag.
scene direction: the coroners wheel him out of the house on a gurney. outside buffy is sitting on the porch steps by the pillar. joyce watches as the coroners wheel ted's body away. she is approached by detective stein.
det. stein: ma'am, i'm detective stein. i'm sorry, but i need to ask you a few questions. your relationship with the deceased?
joyce: we were, uh, seeing each other.
det. stein: can you tell me what happened?
joyce: he fell. down the stairs, he fell.
det. stein: i see. uh, did he slip? do you know what made him fall?
buffy: i hit him.
scene direction: detective stein turns to look at her sitting on the steps.
buffy: i hit him.
scene change: cut to the police station. joyce is sitting by detective stein's desk, waiting to find out what's going to happen. the camera pans across the room and over to her, looking apprehensive. cut to the interrogation room. buffy is sitting at the table, looking down while being interviewed.
buffy: he was in my room. and we got into an argument.
det. stein: about what?
buffy: he, um...
det. stein: was this the first time that you two had had an argument?
scene direction: buffy looks up
buffy: no. he threatened me. he, he said that he would slap me.
det. stein: that was tonight.
buffy: no. but he had my diary, and i-i tried to take it back, a-and that's when he hit me.
det. stein: where?
scene direction: buffy raises her hand to indicate her right cheek. detective stein leans over to have a look.
det. stein: well, it doesn't look like he hit you very hard.
buffy: i don't bruise easily.
det. stein: so you've been hit before?
buffy: yes.
det. stein: but ted never hit you.
buffy: i told you...
det. stein: before tonight, ted never hit you before tonight?
buffy: what do you want? i-i told you what happened, i didn't mean to!
det. stein: i believe you. things get outta hand. he's a big guy.
scene direction: he writes some notes on his pad. buffy can only watch.
joyce: are you charging her with something?
scene change: cut to joyce still sitting by detective stein's desk.
det. stein: we're not bringing anything up against your daughter right now. she says mr. buchanan struck her, and if that's the case...
scene direction: det. stein shrugs
det. stein: anyway, we've gotta examine it further. right now i think you should just take her home, and the two of you should try and get some rest.
scene change: cut to the street. they're driving home in joyce's jeep. cut inside the car. buffy is looking down sadly. she glances over to her mother briefly, then out the side window.
scene change: cut to school the next day. buffy comes into the hall from outside, and everyone seems to be looking at her as she slowly makes her way to the lounge. cut to the lounge. xander and willow catch up with her.
xander: buffy!
scene direction: they climb the steps up to the couches.
xander: are you okay?
willow: how come you're here?
buffy: i couldn't stay at home.
scene direction: buffy she and willow sit
buffy: mom won't even look at me.
scene direction: xander sits on the table facing them.
willow: what happened? unless you don't want to talk about it.
buffy: we had a fight and i lost my temper. i really let him have it.
willow: the paper said he fell.
buffy: he fell. hard.
xander: what was he?
buffy: what?
xander: what was he? a-a demon? a giant bug? some kind of dark god with the secrets of nouvelle cuisine? i mean, we are talking creature- feature here, right?
scene direction: buffy looks at him a moment and then lowers her eyes.
xander: oh man!
willow: but i'm sure it wasn't your fault. he started it.
buffy: yeah. that defense only works in six-year-old court, will.
xander: court? wa-wait. are they charging you with something?
scene direction: buffy shakes her head
buffy: i-i don't know. not yet.
scene direction: willow looks at her sympathetically.
scene direction: buffy eyes down
buffy: he was a person, and i killed him.
willow: don't say that!
scene direction: buffy looks up at willow
buffy: why not? everyone else is. and it's the truth.
xander: it was an accident.
buffy: i'm the slayer. i had no right to hit him like that.
xander: look, buffy, i don't know what happened exactly. but i do know you. and i know you would never hurt anyone intentionally. well, you know, unless...
buffy: unless they were dating my mother?
scene direction: xander has no response to that.
buffy: i gotta go.
scene direction: she gets up and leaves at a quick pace. xander and willow watch her go and look at each other for what to do.
scene change: cut to the hall. buffy comes striding around the corner. ahead of her giles comes out of a classroom and nods to a man standing outside the door, then sees her coming.
giles: buffy?
scene direction: buffy stops in her tracks, but stays to face him.
giles: are you alright?
scene direction: buffy just looks up at him.
giles: oh, uh, stupid question, i'm sorry. look, i-i-if there's anything you need, of course, just, just ask.
scene direction: buffy notices the man guarding the door
buffy: what's going on?
scene direction: buffy walks toward the classroom
giles: oh, you needn't worry about that. they're just asking a few questions, your, your, your behavior and... um... uh...
scene direction: buffy looks into the room through the door window and sees detective stein talking with two of her teachers.
giles: of course, i told them you, uh... i...
scene direction: buffy quickly walks off.
scene change: cut to the library. willow and cordelia are at the table. willow is surfing for information. giles is behind them in the cage getting together some weapons. xander is pacing.
xander: man, this is killing me! that bastard was up to something, i know it. if i could just get my hands on him...
scene direction: willow gives him a look.
xander: earlier this week.
cordelia: i thought you liked him.
scene direction: xander steps over to her
xander: i sometimes like things that are not good for me. besides, no way, no how does buffy put the big hurt on an innocent man. nice uncle ted was dirty.
scene direction: giles comes out of the cage with his bag in one hand and the crossbow in the other.
willow: we've gotta prove that somehow. xander, do you have a pen?
scene direction: giles sets the bag on the table and puts the crossbow in. xander opens his satchel to get a pen.
xander: if buffy has to go to jail because of that creep i'm gonna lose it. he's gotta be in there, will. uh, history of domestic violence, a criminal record?
scene direction: xander finds a zip-lock bag
xander: ooo! cookies!
scene direction: giles goes back into the cage for more weapons.
cordelia: i don't get it. buffy's the slayer. shouldn't she have...
xander: what, a license to kill?
scene direction: xander takes a bite of a cookie
cordelia: well, not for fun. but she's like this superman. shouldn't there be different rules for her?
willow: sure, in a fascist society.
cordelia: right! why can't we have one of those?
willow: buffy's not going to jail. it's not fair.
scene direction: giles comes back
giles: whatever the authorities have planned for her, it can't be much worse than what she's doing to herself.
scene direction: giles adds an ax and other stuff to the bag
giles: she's taken a human life. the guilt, it-it's, it's pretty hard to bear, and it won't go away soon.
cordelia: i guess you should know, since you helped raise that demon that killed that guy that time?
giles: yes. do let's bring that up as often as possible.
scene direction: giles heads back to the cage
xander: so, giles, you takin' over tonight?
scene direction: xander takes another bite of his cookie
giles: um, well, buffy's not in any shape to patrol.
scene direction: giles comes back to the table
giles: the least i can do is pick up the slack. someone has to.
scene direction: giles adds several crosses to the bag
willow: giles, you shouldn't go out there without the slayer.
giles: until buffy regains her equilibrium, there *is* no slayer.
scene direction: xander takes another bite of his cookie.
cordelia: if you need help...
giles: no, uh, buffy needs your help more than i. you carry on investigating, see if you can find out as much about this buchanan chap as possible.
scene direction: giles takes up the bag to go
willow: be careful.
giles: i-i will.
scene direction: giles leaves
willow: ted's got no criminal record! damn! this guy's like citizen of the year!
xander: don't sweat it. it'll be fine.
willow: don't sweat it?
xander: yeah, cute buddy!
scene direction: xander goes over to her
xander: we'll work it out!
scene direction: xander ruffles her hair
xander: no worries!
cordelia: what happened to 'this is killing me'?
scene direction: xander shakes his cookie at cordelia
xander: worrying isn't gonna solve any problems.
scene direction: the cookie catches willow's eye and she grabs it from xander, breaking off most of it. she turns it in her hand as she looks at it.
scene change: cut to buffy's house. cut to the kitchen. joyce is packing away a bunch of baking pans and bowls. buffy comes in and stands at the door, fidgeting with her hands.
buffy: can i help?
joyce: it's done. i've been meaning to clean out this junk for months. do you, uh, have homework?
buffy: i didn't mean to hurt him.
joyce: i don't wanna talk about this.
buffy: mom, please, you have to know...
joyce: i can't, not yet. please, buffy, just go to your room.
scene direction: buffy looks like she's about to burst into tears as she turns to go to her room. joyce waits for a moment, almost crying herself, too, then picks up the box and takes it into the basement.
scene change: cut to the science lab at school. several cookies are sitting on a scale. willow is staring into a microscope.
willow: okay!
xander: what do we know?
willow: well, apparently the secret ingredient
scene direction: willow looks up from the scope
willow: is not love.
xander: what is it then?
willow: i'm not positive, but i think it's dematorin. it's like a tranquilizer, keeps you all mellow and compliant. it also shares a few components with ecstasy.
xander: this is evidence! this is real evidence that ted was some kind of a crook! buffy's cleared! willow, you are the best human ever! i adore you!
scene direction: she gives him a wide smile.
xander: well, that's the cookies talkin', but you rock!
scene direction: cordelia comes into the lab
cordelia: well, your search finally hit pay dirt. you got some personal records, marriage certificates and an address.
scene direction: (puts the printouts on the table)
xander: well, let's check it out, get our slayer back on her feet before somebody else gets hurt.
scene direction: they all head out of the lab. willow grabs the printouts on the way.
scene change: cut to the park. giles is walking slowly past some bushes, weapons bag in hand, when he's startled and spins around holding up a cross.
giles: ah!
jenny: yeah, i get that reaction from men all the time.
giles: jenny! what are you doing here?
jenny: i saw your car back there. i wanted to apologize.
giles: well, now is... not the best time to go ta...
jenny: no, no, please, please, lemme just, lemme get this out.
scene direction: jenny exhales
jenny: i was sooo... harsh the other day. i am so sorry. i mean, i know how badly you must feel about putting me in danger before, and...
scene direction: giles looks past her
giles: right in harm's view now.
scene direction: a vampire comes out of the bushes behind jenny and growls at them.
scene change: cut to buffy's room. she's sitting at her desk facing into the room. she hears a noise.
buffy: mom?
scene direction: buffy silence
scene direction: buffy exhales
buffy: the hell with this.
scene direction: she gets up and strides over to her window. she tries to lift the sash, but it's stuck in place. she looks as it and sees the problem.
buffy: she nailed it shut. well, it's official, this day can't get any worse.
scene direction: she senses something behind her and spins around to see ted standing there.
ted: beg to differ.
scene change: *** part 4 ***
scene direction: buffy's room. she has her back to the window as ted confronts her.
buffy: you died.
ted: that's right, little lady, you killed me. do we have something to say about that? are we sorry?
buffy: what are you?
ted: i'm a salesman! that's what you should've remembered. no matter how you put him down...
scene direction: he grabs her by the strap of her coveralls and yanks her across the room. she falls into her desk chair.
ted: ...a good salesman always bounces back!
scene change: cut to the park. the vampire roars and attacks. jenny screams in fright and jumps aside, so the vampire crashes into giles, grabbing him and pulling him to the ground with him. giles holds his cross in the vampire's face.
scene direction: giles to jenny
giles: my bag!
scene direction: jenny jumps over to the dropped bag and pulls out the crossbow. giles struggles with the vampire and punches him in the face, but the vampire isn't fazed. giles punches him again harder, and this time the vampire pulls away far enough for giles to get his foot underneath him to push him off. the vampire lands on his back while giles scrambles to his feet. the vampire jumps up and starts to wrestle with giles. jenny in the mean time has loaded a bolt into the crossbow and anxiously looks for an opening. they turn back and forth, not giving jenny a clear shot.
scene change: cut to buffy's room. she gets to her feet as ted comes for her. she immediately kicks him in the gut and follows up with a left to the jaw.
scene direction: ted flinches, but doesn't back off. buffy punches him twice in the stomach and again in the face, but he isn't fazed, and he grabs her by the throat and backs her into and over her desk, pinning her against the wall.
ted: you see i had to shut down for a while to get you off my back. you should've seen the intern's face when i got up off the table, it was a hoot! fun's over, though.
scene direction: he wraps his other hand around her throat and begins to squeeze.
scene change: cut to the park. giles and the vampire continue to wrestle, constantly turning so that jenny still doesn't have a clear shot. at one point the turning stops, and jenny decides it's time for her to shoot.
jenny: say good night, big guy!
scene direction: the vampire turns giles around just as jenny lets the bolt fly, and it hits giles in the lower left of his back.
giles: ahhh!
scene direction: jenny lowers the crossbow and looks at them, shocked by what happened.
jenny: oh, god!
scene direction: the vampire lets go of giles and steps back. giles grabs the shaft of the bolt and bends over in pain.
jenny: oh, no!
scene direction: she bends down to the bag and searches frantically for another bolt.
scene direction: vampire laughs
vampire: nice shot, lady!
scene direction: giles rends the bolt from his back and jams it into the vampire's chest.
scene direction: jenny has found another bolt and stands back up to see giles let go of the bolt. the vampire falls to the ground and explodes into ashes. jenny stares in shock and relief at what she's just seen.
scene change: cut to buffy's room. ted tightens his grip on buffy's throat. she looks over at her nightstand for anything to use as a weapon and reaches for her nail file that's lying there. she grabs it and stabs ted in the left forearm with it. ted yanks his arm away from her, slicing it open on the file as he jerks back. buffy collapses to the floor.
ted: that wasn't playing fair, missy!
scene direction: he grabs his left wrist with his right hand and looks down at the wound.
scene direction: there are torn wires and sparks and smoke coming from it.
ted: you're gonna find...
scene direction: his head jerks to the right when some short circuits result from the cut.
ted: hell of a day! makes you feel like you're eighteen again!
scene direction: ted his head jerks back
ted: ...that i don't like being disobeyed!
scene change: cut downstairs. joyce comes out of the basement with another empty box and closes the door behind her. cut to buffy's room. ted hears the sound of the door closing downstairs. he kicks buffy in the jaw, and knocks her out. he goes to her door, opens it and looks out into the hall. he gives buffy another look as he pulls his sleeve down over the cut in his arm. his head jerks again from another short.
ted: don't worry about me and your mother. we're gonna be very happy!
scene direction: he leaves the room and closes and locks the door behind him.
scene change: cut to ted's small workshop. xander looks in through the multi-paned window and sees the place is dark and empty. he breaks one of the panes with a crowbar and uses it to knock out the broken glass.
willow: careful!
scene direction: xander reaches in through the window and opens the door from inside. he looks in as willow comes to stand in the doorway also, and they scan around the place with their flashlights. slowly they walk in with cordelia right behind them.
xander: let's look around.
scene direction: willow looks over the paperwork they have on him.
cordelia: i'll take the back.
xander: check for cookies.
scene direction: willow gives xander a look.
xander: for evidence!
willow: so far i've counted four marriage certificates.
scene direction: xander looks at some shelves
xander: any divorce papers?
willow: not a one.
xander: so either our boy was a mormon, or...
scene direction: willow notices
willow: whoa, whoa, 1957! ted musta married young! like pre- school young.
scene direction: cordelia comes from the back
cordelia: nothing interesting back here. doesn't look like anybody's worked here, let alone lived here.
xander: something's missing here. this doesn't seem like ted at all.
scene direction: cordelia looks down
cordelia: yeah, and this rug? it doesn't go with the rest of the decor.
scene direction: xander looks down at the new-looking oriental rug. he and willow exchange a look. xander steps back off of the rug and lifts it back.
scene direction: underneath is a trap door
