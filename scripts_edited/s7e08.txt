willow: it wasn't her.
dawn: what?
willow: at least, i don't think. i-i saw something too, and it looked like... someone else, but it wasn't.
dawn: i don't understand.
willow: it's the big bad, dawn. the one we knew was coming.
dawn: but, that's what she said. mom, she said that things were coming, that things were on their way, and that she loves us. so, it had to be her, right? i mean, her warning was true.
scene direction: willow shakes head
willow: i don't know. i just don't think we can trust anything right now.
dawn: so maybe the evil thing messing with you was here too. only maybe it was the thing trying to keep mom away. 'cause she was trying to protect me. maybe.

scene direction: xander's making himself a cup of coffee while chatting with buffy.
xander: why would a vampire lie about who sired him. what's that? some kind of status symbol for the undead. my sire can beat up your sire.
scene direction: xander sits
buffy: i'm not saying i don't believe him.
xander: you just don't want to. ok, let's look at this objectively. figure it out in a cold, impersonal, csi-like manner 'cause we're a couple of carpet fibers away from a case.
buffy: spike can't be the one doing this. he couldn't if he wanted to.
xander: why not?
buffy: well, for one thing, pain chip, remember? he can't hurt anyone.
xander: didn't stop him from hurting you.
scene direction: xander buffy looks away
xander: hey, objective here. maybe the chip's not working anymore.
buffy: oh, it's working. i've seen it.
xander: is it? or is that what spike wants you to think?
buffy: you think it's an act?
xander: i don't really know. and neither do you.
buffy: no, mm-mmm. there's something. i-i can feel it. he's different. he's changed. and, if it is an act, then the oscar goes to...

xander: whoa, whoa, whoa. when you say we you mean me. and me's gotta go to work. i got a big client meeting in a couple of hours.

anya: uh-uh. forget it, harris.
xander: come on, anya. you said you'd do it on the phone.
anya: yeah, but that—
scene direction: anya lowers her voice
anya: that was before you told me spike's killing again, and now you want me to be alone with him?
xander: you didn't mind being alone with him before.
anya: what was that?
xander: nothing. look, we don't actually know that he's killed anyone. you know, lately. might all just be a mistake.
anya: yeah, but you don't think so. ok, have you searched his room for clues? trophies from victims? killers like to keep trophies sometimes. scalps, necklaces made from human teeth.
xander: you know, it didn't occur to me to look, but thanks for the tip. ok, so you'll be safe in here. plenty of sunlight for you to hide in.
scene direction: xander tries to leave
scene direction: anya follows him
anya: what? that's it? you're not at least gonna like leave me a crossbow or a flame thrower? something to protect myself?
xander: we don't want him to know we suspect anything. besides if he tries to leave, i don't want you confronting him. call buffy and just let her know that he's on the move. you're gonna be fine.
scene direction: xander grabs his hard hat and briefcase
anya: better be, because if i get vamped, i'm gonna bite your ass.

buffy: dawn? dawn!
scene direction: willow softly
willow: buffy, it's ok. she's ok. not hurt. she's just exhausted. finally fell off to sleep.
buffy: what the hell happened? downstairs looks like—
willow: hell happened? yeah. this big evil that's been promising to devour us—well i think it's started chomping.
buffy: oh, god. and it started with dawn?
willow: both of us. buffy, this thing knows us. it made us think that we were talking to people we knew. mine said it came with a message from tara. but dawn actually saw... your mother. this thing—it had me for a while—i mean, before it started letting loose with the pulse-pounding terror. but before that, the lies were very convincing. it just seems real.
buffy: lies.
willow: i mean maybe—maybe to confuse us, to mess us up. or maybe just to be cool.
buffy: vampire i killed last night told me spike sired him—two nights ago.
willow: well, that's impossible, right? so maybe it was another one. a fake-out. you got one too. it wasn't a real vamp.
buffy: it dusted real enough.
willow: buffy, do you think spike is—
buffy: i can't.
scene direction: buffy sighs
buffy: i hope not. but if i'm wrong and he is, then i have to see it for myself. i have to be there to stop it.

scene direction: anya sneaks into spike's room quietly, holding a stake in her hand. spike's sleeping shirtless in the bed. she sneaks over to his dresser and goes through each drawer looking for something. the shot shows that spike's wearing nothing under the sheets. anya goes through his pants which are on the bed, then through his shirt which is on the floor. he rolls over, and she continues rifling through his stuff. he wakes and grabs her wrist. she's frozen in panic.
spike: anya, do be specific and tell a fellow just exactly what you're doing here.
anya: well, spike... i'm here, obviously... for...um...sex.
scene direction: spike sits up, retracts
spike: uh, beg pardon.
scene direction: anya kneels beside bed, holding stake
anya: you and me. here and now. let's go. let's... get it on, you big bad boy.
spike: wait, wait, anya. just a minute. this is not exactly—is that a stake?
anya: yes. kinky.
scene direction: anya puts the stake down
spike: uh, well, yeah, but what do you—?
anya: shh.
scene direction: anya presses her finger to his lips
anya: no questions. no talking. i can't help it. i can't stop thinking about you and us and our brief but unforgettable time together. i mean, it's—why else would i be here? i mean, it's not like i'm snooping around looking for proof that you're some sort of wacked out serial killer.
scene direction: anya laughs
anya: i don't know why i said that. forget i said that. it's craziness talking. it's just nerves. nerves. nerves and-and horniness. oh, just shut up, william, and take me. take me now.
scene direction: anya breathes hard
scene direction: anya has slowly inched closer and closer to him while she talked. she leans over his chest, and kisses his neck. spike has backed away as far as he can, but there's a wall preventing further retreat, so he just lies there, still and unresponsive. anya notices the utter lack of reciprocation and sits up.
scene direction: spike sighs
spike: anya.
anya: hmm?
spike: it's not that i'm not tempted. obviously, if things were different, you're a right catch.
anya: i got it. no problem, i understand.
scene direction: anya beat
anya: you think i'm fat.
spike: what?
anya: well, it's either that or the haircut.
spike: ridiculous. the do's quite fetching.
anya: oh, right. now you like the haircut.
spike: love it.
anya: sure, as a friend.
spike: anya.
anya: you know, you were a lot more fun when you didn't have a soul.
spike: oh, come on. now, i've just explained to you—
anya: all i'm saying is soulless spike would have had me upside down and half way to happy land by now.
spike: i need my pants.

anya: who's hurt. i'm fine.

scene direction: cut to 16 ext. sunnydale promenade - night
scene direction: there's lots of people bustling about in the streets. a musician is playing his harmonica on the corner. as spike passes him, the song changes, and spike starts humming along. buffy's only a few paces behind, following spike. the crowd is dense, and he's difficult for her to follow. she watches him go up to a young woman in line to get into a club. he whispers in her ear, and she walks off with him, hand in hand. buffy tries to follow, but it's getting more difficult. spike's got his arm around the young woman now.
young woman: so, um, what kind of name is spike?
scene direction: buffy's lost him in the crowd now, looking around hoping to spot him again.
scene direction: cut to 17 ext. alley near sunnydale promenade - night

young woman: i'll guess you're a little bit bad, huh?
scene direction: young woman she kisses him
scene direction: buffy's getting worried. she walks faster and faster until she's at a jog.
young woman: am i right? are you a bad boy? 'cause i don't mind. you know, i was getting pretty bored waiting over there in that line.
scene direction: young woman nuzzles him
young woman: i hate waiting.
scene direction: young woman kisses his neck, he sighs
young woman: know what i mean?
scene direction: as spike's kissing the young woman's neck where he would bite her, buffy walks into the alley. spike's eyes widen, and he looks up at her.
buffy: you know you want it. you know i want you to.
scene direction: young woman following his glance, but seeing no one there
young woman: um, is everything—
scene direction: young woman he vamps, she screams, he bites her

scene direction: cut to 18 ext. alley near sunnydale promenade - night
scene direction: spike's biting the young woman, while buffy looks on.
buffy: now, doesn't that feel better?
scene direction: spike's face de-vamps, and he looks up at buffy covered in blood. he drops the young woman, stares at buffy, shudders, and runs away. buffy smiles and morphs into spike.
buffy: how could you use a poor maiden so?
scene direction: cut to 19 int. spike's bedroom at xander's apartment - night
scene direction: buffy storms into spike's bedroom, and throws him out of bed. he lands on the floor next to the bed.
buffy: did you kill her?
spike: what?
buffy: the girl. last night.
spike: what girl?
scene direction: spike turns on light
spike: what are you talking about?
buffy: i caught the first act. i missed the curtain call. did you kill her? did you turn her? is she one of your kind now?
spike: did-did you—are you following me?
buffy: answer the question. where is she?
scene direction: spike stands
spike: who knows? i talked to her is all.
buffy: really.
scene direction: buffy crosses arms
buffy: looked like more than talking to me.
spike: well, i certainly didn't off her. where are you getting this?
scene direction: spike grabs a shirt
spike: you know i can't.
buffy: right. the chip.
scene direction: spike incensed
spike: no, not the chip! not the chip, dammit. you honestly think i'd go to the end of the underworld and back to get my soul and then—
scene direction: spike sighs, shakes head
spike: buffy, i can barely live with what i did. it haunts me. all of it. if you think that i would add to the body count now, you are crazy.
buffy: so, what—you just troll the promenade looking for drunk co-eds cause you're hungry for conversation?
scene direction: spike laughs
spike: oh, is that what this is? right.
buffy: what?
spike: you're jealous!
buffy: don't play games. not now.
scene direction: spike puts on shirt
spike: yeah, you saw me chatting up another bird, giving the eye to somebody else. touched a nerve, didn't it?
buffy: don't flatter yourself.
spike: it burns, huh? but you can't admit it, so you trump up some charge about me being back on the juice.
buffy: this vampire i killed told me—
spike: told you what? that i go out? yeah, i talk to people. women. talk to them 'cause i can't talk to you.
buffy: oh, spike, save it.
spike: as daft a notion as "soulful spike the killer" is, it is nothing compared to the idea that another girl could mean anything to me. this chip—they did to me. i couldn't help it. but the soul, i got on my own—for you.
buffy: i know.
spike: so, yeah. i go and pass the time... with someone. but that's all it is is time, 'cause—god, help me, buffy—it's still all about you.
buffy: spike, this vampire told me you sired him.
spike: that doesn't mean—
buffy: he said you killed him. dumped him in a parking lot somewhere.
spike: and you believe him? vampires aren't—
buffy: i did follow you last night, and you know what? you didn't look lonely or casual to me. you looked like you were on the prowl.
spike: you can't know that.
buffy: so, then, tell me. tell me what happened. you talked to her, then what?
spike: we talked. that's all i remember.
buffy: all you remember?
spike: i don't know. i go out. i talk to people or i don't. it's boring. it all bleeds together.
buffy: well, if you seem to forget that much, then—
spike: not that. the taste of human blood. that, i'd remember.
buffy: you were camped out on the hell mouth talking to invisible people. recently. how can you be sure of—
spike: no! you are wrong. you've got an accusation from a pile of dust and not a shred of proof.
buffy: so, i'll get some.
scene direction: buffy leaves the room
scene direction: cut to 20 int. buffy's house - day
scene direction: willow's on the laptop, and anya's looking through the bookcase. buffy and dawn are standing nearby.
buffy: ok, guys, find me some evidence that he did this.
anya: really? are you sure that's what you want.
buffy: find me the proof that he didn't.
scene direction: buffy anya sits at table near willow
dawn: you only think spike is turning people 'cause that vampire told you so, right? but that night we were all told things that weren't true.
willow: maybe.
dawn: what? what maybe.
willow: well, just because those weren't the spirits of, you know, our people—just because it was some evil thing, doesn't mean what they said can't be true.
anya: i used to tell the truth all the time when i was evil.
buffy: look, we can't assume anything. we need hard facts.
anya: well, if spike is biting people again, should there be more dead people with neck trauma? right? we can find that.
willow: no.
anya: no, we can't find that? but that's easy. that computer's a moron.
willow: i mean, no, there's not really an increase in neck injuries, but...
buffy: but what?
willow: oh. missing people. eight, maybe. oh, ten of them. no bodies, they're just missing. mostly young. lots of girls.
dawn: so, it's true? what that vampire told buffy turned out to be true.
buffy: maybe. but it still doesn't prove that it's spike. right now, he's the only one who knows for sure.

scene direction: spike's getting ready to go out, when he puts on his jacket. he feels something in his pocket—it's the pack of cigarettes one of the young women gave him earlier. holding it, he flashes back to meeting her at the bar and killing her. he stares at the cigarettes, shocked.

scene direction: as first [spike] sings, spike is distracted, mesmerized by the song, unable to respond to buffy, who's trying to get his attention.
buffy: what? what is it? spike!
scene direction: spike vamps out and attacks buffy. she had a stake pointed at him, but he wrenches it out of her hand and throws it away behind him, shattering nearby bottles. buffy throws him across the room.
buffy: what are you doing?
scene direction: he grabs a shard of glass and swings it at her, cutting her shoulder.
buffy: oh!
scene direction: buffy fights with him, and pushes him to the ground.
buffy: spike, listen to me, you don't want to do this.
scene direction: buffy he pushes her away
first [spike]: and it's just about to get fun.
scene direction: vampires start rising from the basement floor, coming for buffy.
buffy: oh, god!
scene direction: buffy fights the vampires, who have taken tools from the basement to fight her with. first [spike] is talking to spike.
first [spike]: you know what i want you to do.
scene direction: buffy continues to fight the vampires, but they manage to get a hold on her, one on each arm, holding her up for spike.
first [spike]: they're waiting for you. take her, taste her, make her weak.
scene direction: spike stands, and walks toward buffy menacingly.
buffy: spike, no!
scene direction: spike puts his face near hers, on each side of her neck, but opts to suck from her open shoulder wound he created earlier by cutting her with the glass. as he mouths her, he flashes back to all the things he's done—killing, burying, and all the rest.
scene direction: spike in human face
spike: i remember.
scene direction: spike's horrified. his face is one of complete shock and disbelief that he could have actually done those things. he recoils from buffy, staggering back to the far end of the room. buffy fights her way free of the vampires' grip. she uses the wooden handle of a garden tool to stake the vampires. meanwhile, spike's hiding in a cubbyhole at the back end of the basement, covering his head with his hands. first [spike] is crouched near him, talking to him.
first [spike]: you failed them. now she's gonna kill you. you lose, mate.
scene direction: an elderly vampire is having difficulty rising from the grave, only able to get her hand out of the dirt. buffy grabs her hand, pulls her up, and stakes her.
buffy: sorry, ma'am, but it's my job.
scene direction: buffy walks over to spike, still carrying the wooden handle. she stands in front of him. he looks at her, knowing his fate, and scoots out of the cubbyhole he was hiding in. he holds open his shirt. he's crying.
spike: do it fast, ok? he said you'd do it.
buffy: who said?
spike: me. it was me. i saw it. i was here the whole time, talking and singing.
scene direction: spike sobs
spike: there was a song.
buffy: what are you talking about?
spike: i don't know. please, i don't remember. don't make me remember.
scene direction: spike to invisible person
spike: make it so i forget again! i did what you wanted!
buffy: there's something here.
scene direction: buffy throws away the wooden tool handle
spike: oh, god, no, please. i need that. i can't cry the soul out of me. it won't come. i killed, and i can feel 'em. i can feel every one of them.
buffy: there's something playing with us. all of us.
spike: what is it? why is it doing this to me?
buffy: i don't know.
spike: will you... help me. can you help me?
buffy: i'll help you.
scene direction: first [spike] is still watching from the staircase. he sighs and sneers, seeming disappointed.

anya: and you believe him?
buffy: you didn't see him down there. he really didn't know what he'd done. it wasn't in his control.
xander: oh, an out of control serial killer. you're right, that is a great houseguest.
dawn: wait, is he—is he staying here?
buffy: i don't know. but i'm not letting him out of my sight, that's for sure.
willow: buffy, he's been feeding... on human blood. that's gotta do stuff.
buffy: i'm not keeping him around just to help him. i think there was something there, talking to him, making him do things.
willow: something like what was talking to us?
buffy: maybe. but if it was, it's been screwing with spike big time.
xander: so, you want him around because...?
buffy: look, there's something evil working us, and if we are ever gonna have a chance to fight it, we need to learn everything we can about it. this thing has been closer to spike than any of us.
willow: and if you want to understand it...
buffy: i'm gonna have to get close to spike.
xander: nah, it's too dangerous.
buffy: i don't have a choice. whatever this thing is, from beneath us, it's bad, and it's only getting worse.
