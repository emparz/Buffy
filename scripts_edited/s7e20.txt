scene direction: cut to 9 int. living room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: the sits, giles, and the scooby gang—minus buffy, spike, and andrew—are sitting together in the living room having a very disorganized discussion. everyone is talking over everyone else.
giles: power to the people? you sound like a child of the seventies.
kennedy: what we're saying is we're in charge in charge of ourselves.
faith: ok, you guys, let's just try not to freak out.
kennedy: all i'm saying is now that buffy's not here, we finally have some say in how and when we lose our necks.
robin: maybe you don't have to be so blunt about
scene direction: robin gestures a cutting motion with his hand in front of his neck
robin: the losing of the necks bit.
scene direction: anya emphatically
anya: no, let the girl speak the truth. we're all on death's door repeatedly ringing the doorbell like maniacal girl scouts trying to make quota.
scene direction: xander shifts in his seat
xander: you know, i'm thinking that everyone here shouldn't have a say.
giles: we just have to find some way of having constructive dialogue without going completely mad.
amanda: do you know the parliamentary procedure? 'cause that's a convenient way of organizing—
kennedy: i just wonder if those of us who have been here longer should have more of a say.
robin: maybe we should break down into small groups so it wouldn't be so chaotic. faith, what do you think?
amanda: when i was involved with the model un, we found the parliamentary procedure to be a total lifesaver. for example, once when i was uruguay—anyway, one of those "u" countries—it was like here, only we had this system which allowed us to organize our conversation.
scene direction: while amanda is talking, giles whispers to dawn.
scene direction: giles to dawn
giles: she's going to be fine. really, it's for the best.
scene direction: dawn to giles
dawn: yeah? then why do i feel like this?
scene direction: faith to the group
faith: i hear what you're saying, but—
kennedy: shouldn't we get down to business?
scene direction: willow rolls her eyes
willow: you guys, i think we're wasting time arguing about how to argue.
amanda: well, why don't we—?
scene direction: vi to amanda
vi: please do not mention parliamentary procedure.
scene direction: caridad under her breath
caridad: i second that.
faith: everyone, listen to me. chill. all right? it's been a long night, and i don't know about you, but i'm wiped. maybe we should catch some sleep and figure all this out in the morning.
kennedy: do we really have time to waste?
faith: look, i understand you guys are wicked stressed. frankly, our situation blows. we've got to stay cool. that's the only way we're going to get through this. can everyone handle that?
vi: yeah...yeah...we'll get some rest and then tomorrow, things won't seem so—
scene direction: the lights go out in the house, and everyone jumps and gasps, frightened, asking what happened.
caridad: the lights went out?
amanda: i'll get some candles... if we have candles.
kennedy: i'll check the fuse box.
scene direction: faith looking out the window
faith: don't bother. all the lights on the whole street just went out.
kennedy: which means?
scene direction: faith looking at the group
faith: that the people from the power company have got the hell out of sunnydale.
vi: i think i'm freaking out.
scene direction: cut to 10 ext. neighborhood street - night
scene direction: the neighborhood is abandoned except for the last family putting their necessities in the minivan. buffy walks down the street by herself, with her arms crossed. she sees a house and walks up to it.
scene direction: cut to 11 int. stranger's house - night
scene direction: buffy walks into the house and looks around. a man comes up to her from within the house and points a shotgun in her face.
man: don't move. get out of my house.
buffy: hey.
scene direction: buffy takes the shotgun away from the man, sighs
buffy: i thought the place would be empty. i was looking for a place to crash. you know, you really should leave.
scene direction: man indignant
man: ou can't just kick me out of my own house.
scene direction: buffy shrugs
buffy: why not? it's what all the cool kids are doing nowadays.
scene direction: buffy walks into the kitchen
buffy: this is not your house. it's not your town. not anymore.
scene direction: buffy opens the refrigerator
buffy: got any tab?
scene direction: opening credits.
scene change: *** act i ***
scene direction: cut to 12 int. mission - day
scene direction: andrew and spike are waiting inside the candlelit interior room of the mission. andrew is lying on the floor on his belly, leaning up on his elbows, propping his head up on his hand, and swinging his feet together like a little boy. spike is sitting on the floor, leaning against the wall with his knees bent up, and his arms resting on his knees.
scene direction: andrew rhythmically
andrew: i spy with my little eye something that begins with a "t."
scene direction: spike rolls his eyes
spike: tapestry.
scene direction: andrew smiles
andrew: hey, good one. how did you—
spike: tapestry's the only thing in the whole bloody room.
andrew: ah...so say you, but i say look deeper.
scene direction: andrew rolls over onto his back, looks at the ceiling
spike: i'll look deep into your jugular is what i'll look at.
andrew: don't spazz out.
spike: i'm not—
scene direction: spike glares at andrew
spike: don't say another word.
scene direction: andrew rolls back on his belly, looks at spike excitedly
andrew: rock, paper, scissors?
spike: what's the matter with you? don't you understand what's happening?
andrew: uh...yeah. we're waiting here till it's night again so you can ride on your motorcycle without exploding.
spike: and every minute we're stuck here, the slayer's out there facing hell knows what.
andrew: come on. what's the worst thing that could happen to her?
scene direction: spike glares at andrew.
scene direction: cut to 13 int. basement at buffy's house - night
scene direction: the potentials and scoobies and dawn, giles and faith are down in the basement having another meeting by candlelight. anya, xander and dawn are sitting at a table. the others are gathered around.
faith: all right. so, what do we know?
xander: well, we know we're basically the last humans left in sunnydale.
caridad: and that all the evil in town wants us dead.
vi: i don't want to die.
anya: don't worry. it's far more likely you'll live long enough to watch most of your friends die first.
scene direction: anya looks at vi
anya: and then you'll die.
kennedy: we also know that caleb told buffy that everything's going down at the seal. i think we should head—
scene direction: faith cuts her off
faith: let's not get ahead of ourselves. so, we know we've got a lot of enemies. we'll start there.
kennedy: faith, i'm sorry—
scene direction: faith cuts her off again
faith: i got this, ok? so let's go over our rogues' gallery. who exactly do we have here?
dawn: well, there's the first, who we can't touch.
xander: then there's our friend the reverend i-hate-women.
anya: who's basically untouchable.
dawn: there's the 'roid-rage vamps, who are pretty much the worst. and the—
faith: bringers...i think they're our weakest link.
giles: are you thinking of attacking the bringers?
faith: maybe, or... ok, we could kidnap one.
scene direction: kennedy nastily
kennedy: and what? hold it ransom?
scene direction: xander sarcastically
xander: yeah, i'll get the magazines and start ripping out the letters now. "dear mr. first, if you want your bringer back... well, we'll be surprised because you got, like, 3 million of them. so please disregard this letter. yours sincerely—"
faith: i'm saying we think about getting us a bringer and making it talk. find out info on the first and caleb that way.
robin: how do you think we should catch one if they don't want to be found?
kennedy: ok, i'm not sure this is such a good idea. why try and get information when we already know about the seal? why don't we send a team to the high school? do some recon and—
faith: no.
scene direction: kennedy sits back, raises eyebrows
kennedy: just like that? you're not even listening.
scene direction: willow softly, to kennedy
willow: sweetie, you're pushing too hard.
kennedy: i thought things would be different now, but you keep shutting me down.
faith: things are different, because now...
scene direction: faith stands
faith: i'm your boss. look, you guys, i'm not buffy. i'm not the one who's been on your asses all this time, but i'm not one of you anymore, either. i'm your leader, which means i go first, and i make the rules, and the rest of you follow after me. is that clear? so, kennedy,
scene direction: faith points
faith: back the hell off, and let me do my job, all right?
scene direction: faith calmly
faith: ok, let's get down to business.
scene direction: cut to 14 int. wine cellar at the shadow valley vineyards - night
scene direction: bringers are using welding torches and pick-axes on some stone in a cave under the vineyard. buffy/first and caleb look on.
first [buffy]: i was hoping you'd bring me some better news.
caleb: and i wish i had some.
first [buffy]: is this going to do anything? or is all of this just to make the bringers sweat? do the bringers sweat?
caleb: actually, i think they pant, like dogs. and i don't know if this is going to do any good, but we have to try everything.
first [buffy]: you realize what will happen if the slayer and her girls get it, don't you?
caleb: they won't.
scene direction: first [buffy] looks at caleb
first [buffy]: that's right. they won't.
scene direction: first [buffy] walks away
first [buffy]: because you're going to kill all of them and everyone they know.
caleb: hallelujah.
scene direction: cut to 15 ext. alley - night
scene direction: kennedy walks down the alley alone, looking at the ground and pouting. a bringer comes up behind her wielding a knife, but someone lassos him around the neck and pulls him to the ground. it's giles. giles ties up the bringer as the other potential slayers go to kennedy's aid, fighting off the other bringers that have shown up, using the bringers' knives against them.
scene direction: kennedy stands after killing a bringer, panting
kennedy: i've never been the bait before. that was, uh... actually, kind of scary.
caridad: we had your back.
scene direction: giles tying up a bringer
giles: you did well. your performance as a disgruntled minion was spot on.
kennedy: i'm method.
scene direction: kennedy smiles
kennedy: let's get this back to the captain.
scene change: fade to black.
scene change: *** act ii ***
scene direction: cut to 16 int. kitchen at buffy's house - dusk
scene direction: giles and a few others come up from the basement to talk to the gang assembled in the kitchen.
scene direction: dawn sees giles
dawn: oh, hey. so?
giles: uh, the bringer's dumb.
scene direction: giles puts on his glasses
anya: you were expecting, what, a rhodes scholar?
giles: dumb as in mute.
faith: someone ripped out its tongue.
amanda: oh, gross.
dawn: hey...i've been reading this old turkish spell book. there's an old conjuration that the ancient turks used to communicate with the dying.
willow: oh, yeah. i think i've read a translation of it.
scene direction: dawn wide-eyed
dawn: there's a translation of it?!
scene direction: dawn sighs
dawn: i'm over it. um, so the spell is used to communicate with people who can't talk. um, like if a person was dying, this spell would let them say their good-byes or, you know, gripe about how nobody came to visit them. would this help us with mr. no-tongue?
willow: yeah, i think so. i just need to get together a few ingredients.
faith: all right. well, cool. while willow does that, the rest of us can—
andrew o.s.: we're back!
scene direction: spike walks into the room.
giles: spike.
spike: hey.
scene direction: andrew walks into the room, puts his helmet on a shelf
andrew: hi, everybody. i missed you guys a lot. sorry it took so long to get back from our mission-mission, but we had to wait out the sun. well, i think our mission went very well. we, uh, we rode on spike's hog, which was very cool, and, uh... uh, played some amusing games, and—oh! we got some new information. you know what? i really need to urinate.
scene direction: andrew walks out of the room
spike: he's a breath of fresh air, isn't he? thank god i don't breathe. so, i think we got a lead. where's buffy?
dawn: um...
scene direction: dawn looks away
dawn: she's not here right now.
spike: when's she get back?
scene direction: willow walks toward spike, wringing her hands, nervously
willow: uh...while you were gone, we all got together and t-talked out some disagreements that we were having. um... and eventually, after much discussion, buffy decided that it would be best for all of us if she took a little time off, a little breather.
scene direction: spike stares in disbelief
spike: uh-huh. i see. been practicing that little speech long, have you?
scene direction: spike willow looks hurt and walks away
spike: so, uh, buffy took some time off right in the middle of the apocalypse, and it was her decision?
xander: well, we all decided.
spike: oh, yeah. you all decided.
scene direction: spike chuckles
spike: you sad, sad, ungrateful traitors. who do you think you are?
willow: we're her friends. we just want—
spike: oh, that's ballsy of you. you're her friends, and you betray her like this?
giles: you don't understand—
spike: you know, i think i do...
scene direction: spike disdainfully
spike: rupert. you used to be the big man, didn't you? the teacher all full of wisdom. now she's surpassed you, and you can't handle it. she has saved your lives again and again.
scene direction: spike the others roll their eyes and avoid eye contact with spike
spike: she's died for you. and this is how you thank—
faith: hey. why don't you take it down a notch or two? the time for speech-giving is over, bat boy.
scene direction: spike crosses his arms
spike: oh, is that right?
faith: yeah, that's right. save your lack of breath.
scene direction: spike shrugs
spike: all right.
scene direction: spike punches faith
faith: you're pretty sweet on her, aren't you?
scene direction: faith kicks spike in the face
faith: i think it's cute.
scene direction: faith spike punches faith; she punches him back
faith: they way she's got you whipped.
scene direction: faith kicks spike into the other room where he slides over the dining room table and onto the floor
giles: enough!
scene direction: faith goes into the dining room after spike and starts punching him in the face repeatedly. he kicks her off of him and leaps to his feet.
spike: finally got what you wanted, didn't you?
scene direction: spike exchanges punches with faith
spike: where is she?
faith: i don't know.
scene direction: spike rolls faith over his back and flings her into the dining room wall pretty hard. she gets to her feet as does spike, and they stare at each other for a moment before spike finally walks out the front door. all the others are standing in the doorway watching the fight.
scene direction: cut to 17 ext. in front of buffy's house - night
scene direction: spike walks out the front door and down the path toward the street. he pauses, shuts his eyes, and smells purposefully. finally he catches the scent he's looking for and walks down the street.
scene direction: cut to 18 int. basement at buffy's house - night
scene direction: a bringer is chained to the basement wall as willow does a spell in another language. giles, kennedy, xander, and andrew are there as well.
scene direction: willow holding a book open in her hands
willow: speak to us.
andrew: maybe i should rough him up a little.
scene direction: xander to andrew
xander: andrew!
scene direction: kennedy to andrew
kennedy: quiet!
willow: i don't know, guys. that should have worked.
scene direction: willow giles and willow stare at the bringer
scene direction: andrew not sounding like himself, but soft and monotonous
andrew: i am a drone in the mind that is evil.
scene direction: xander to andrew
xander: could you just shut up?
scene direction: andrew not sounding like himself, but soft and monotonous
andrew: i say i'm part of the great darkness.
scene direction: kennedy rolls her eyes
kennedy: somebody needs a reality check.
xander: or a muzzle.
scene direction: giles looks at andrew
giles: wait.
scene direction: andrew speaking for the bringer
andrew: i'm only a fragment of the we. we work as one to serve the first.
scene direction: xander and kennedy stand and back away from the table where andrew is sitting. giles and willow stand as well, and they all stare at andrew.
willow: ok, what do you—the we—do for the first?
scene direction: andrew speaking for the bringer
andrew: we work to prepare for the inevitable battle.
scene direction: kennedy grabs the bringer's knife off the table and holds it to the bringer's throat
kennedy: how? tell me exactly what the bringers are doing.
giles: kennedy, he can't see the knife.
scene direction: andrew speaking for the bringer
andrew: we can feel the knife.
giles: kennedy?
scene direction: giles holds his hand out to her; she stands and hands him the knife
scene direction: andrew speaking for the bringer
andrew: we attend to the needs of the infinite evil. we exterminate girls and destroy the legacy of the slayer. we build an arsenal beneath the dirt. we obey the commands of our teacher caleb.
xander: wait. could we go back to the dirt thing?
scene direction: andrew speaking for the bringer
andrew: we build weapons to prepare for the coming war... at the farthest edge of town. we are everywhere. we are like the ocean's waves. we watch your efforts and are not scared. we will laugh at you as you die.
scene direction: giles takes the bringer's knife and slits the bringer's throat with it. the bringer goes limp.
scene direction: andrew himself again, stands, upset
andrew: what the bananas?! you are so lucky that you did not just... magically decapitate me.
giles: we've got enough here. we need to get faith in on this. xander, gather some maps. we need to find a subterranean space large enough to house an armory.
scene direction: everyone else leaves the room and goes upstairs.
scene direction: andrew following after everyone
andrew: i feel used and violated, and...
scene direction: andrew holds his throat
andrew: i need a lozenge.
scene direction: cut to 19 int. stranger's house - night
scene direction: buffy's sleeping on the bed when there's a knock at the door. a few moments later, spike walks up to the room where she's sleeping.
scene direction: spike standing in the doorway
spike: there you are. do you realize i could just walk in here, no invite needed? this town really is theirs now, isn't it?
scene direction: spike walks up to buffy
spike: i heard. i was over there. that bitch.
scene direction: spike sighs
spike: she's all about smiles and reformation when you're on your feet, but the moment you're down, she's all about the kicking, isn't that right? makes me want—
scene direction: buffy softly, staring off into the corner
buffy: it wasn't just faith. it was all of them.
scene direction: buffy looks at spike
buffy: and it's not like they were wrong. please leave.
spike: no.
scene direction: spike excited
spike: this'll change your tune. i came here 'cause i got something to tell you. you were right. caleb is trying to protect something from you. and i think you were spot on all the way. i think it's at the vineyard. so? you were right.
scene direction: spike she still hasn't moved or reacted
spike: buffy?
buffy: i don't feel very right.
scene direction: spike walks closer to her
spike: you're not fooling me.
buffy: what do you even mean?
spike: well, you're not a quitter.
buffy: watch me.
spike: you were their leader, and you still are. this isn't something you gave up, it's something they took.
scene direction: buffy looks at him
buffy: and the difference is?
spike: we can take it back.
scene direction: cut to 20 int. buffy's room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: faith and giles are looking at a map.
faith: sewer tunnel on the north side's closest, so guess we'll start there.
giles: sounds fine. what time shall i tell everyone?
faith: how about around 7:00?
scene direction: faith beat
faith: 7:00 sharp. so, tomorrow we fight.
giles: tomorrow. good night, faith.
scene direction: giles starts to walk away, then turns to her
giles: faith.
faith: yeah?
giles: you're doing just fine.
scene direction: giles walks away
scene direction: faith starts to walk toward the bed but looks up to see the mayor (from season 3) standing there in front of her.
first [mayor]: i'd say better than fine. i'd say you're doing a bang-up job.
faith: get out.
scene direction: first [mayor] laughs
first [mayor]: well, gosh.
scene direction: first [mayor] smiles
first [mayor]: i think, you know, a "hello" or a "nice to see you" might be a little more welcome. it's the end of humanity, faith,
scene direction: first [mayor] shakes his head
first [mayor]: not the end of courtesy.
faith: you're wasting your time. i know who you are, what you are.
scene direction: first [mayor] nods
first [mayor]: yeah. yeah.
scene direction: first [mayor] looks at faith
first [mayor]: nobody's explained to you how this works, have they?
scene direction: first [mayor] paces
first [mayor]: you see... i am part of the first, as you kids call it, but i'm also me, richard wilkins iii, late mayor and founder of sunnydale. here. i'll prove it to you. ask me a question only i know the answer to. something like...
scene direction: first [mayor] laughs
first [mayor]: where did i hide the moon pies in my office? or... who was my favorite character in little women? meg.
scene direction: first [mayor] laughs
first [mayor]: i know. i know. most people guess beth, but meg, she's such a proper young lady. remember when jo burned her hair?
scene direction: faith looks in his face
faith: i know what you're doing, and it's not going to work.
scene direction: faith walks away
faith: but feel free to keep talking, 'cause, hell, i could listen to you yap all night.
first [mayor]: hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. language! you're a leader now. you keep throwing the "h-e-double hockey sticks" around, pretty soon, the girls are going to pick up on it. then what?
scene direction: faith nods
faith: you let me worry about the girls.
first [mayor]: of course. of course. you're doing a great job with them, by the way. much better than buffy ever did. you were smart to kick her out.
scene direction: faith shakes her head
faith: that's not what we—
scene direction: faith the mayor looks at her, raises his eyebrows in disbelief
faith: buffy got them this far.
first [mayor]: why are you protecting her? you think she cares about you? she nearly killed you, faith.
faith: it's different now.
scene direction: first [mayor] walks up to faith
first [mayor]: no matter what you do, buffy will always see you as a killer, not as a person. and now you have what she so desperately wants: the respect of these girls. all she needs is an excuse, and she'll finish what she started when she stuck that knife in your belly. you stay on guard, faith. buffy's dangerous. if you're not careful, she'll destroy you.
scene direction: first [mayor] shrugs
first [mayor]: i'm just saying.
scene change: fade to black.

scene direction: cut to 21 int. stranger's house - night
scene direction: buffy is sitting on the edge of the bed. spike is standing up in front of her.
spike: no?
buffy: no.
spike: you mean no as in eventually?
buffy: you really have problems with that word, don't you?
spike: you can get them back.
buffy: can, maybe. should?
scene direction: buffy sighs, holds her head in her hands
buffy: i'm just so tired.
spike: they need you.
buffy: well, i...
spike: it's bloody chaos over there without you.
buffy: it is?
spike: yeah! yeah, it's, uh... there's junk... you know? food cartons, sleeping bags not rolled up, everyone's very scared and, uh, unkempt.
scene direction: buffy smirks
buffy: sounds dire.
spike: i didn't see a lot.
scene direction: spike sits on the edge of the bed beside her
spike: i came, hit faith a bunch of times, and left.
buffy: really? i mean, not that i'm glad, but—
spike: oh, you say the word, and she's a footnote in history. i'll make it look like a painful accident.
buffy: that's my problem. i say the word, some girl dies...every time.
spike: there's always casualties in war.
buffy: casualties. it just sounds so...casual. these are girls that i got killed. i cut myself off from them...all of them. i knew i was gonna lose some of them and i didn't—
scene direction: buffy shakes her head, stands up
buffy: you know what? i'm still making excuses. i've always cut myself off. i've always—
scene direction: buffy sighs
buffy: being the slayer made me different. but it's my fault i stayed that way. people are always trying to connect to me, and i just slip away.
scene direction: buffy chuckles
buffy: you should know.
spike: i seem to recall a certain amount of connecting.
scene direction: buffy shakes her head
buffy: oh, please! we were never close. you just wanted me because i was...unattainable.
scene direction: spike stands, angrily
spike: you think that's all that was?
buffy: please, let's not go over the past.
scene direction: buffy sits
spike: oh, no, no. let's hold on here. i'm hummed along to your pity-ditty, and i think i should have the mic for a bit.
buffy: fine. the stage is yours. cheer me up.
spike: you're insufferable.
buffy: thank you. that really helped.
spike: i'm not trying to cheer you up.
buffy: what are you trying to say?
spike: i don't know. i'll know when i'm done saying it. something pissed me off, and i just— "unattainable." that's it.
buffy: fine. i'm attainable. i'm an attain-a-thon. may i please just go to sleep?
spike: you listen to me.
scene direction: spike kneels in front of her
spike: i've been alive a bit longer than you, and dead a lot longer than that. i've seen things you couldn't imagine, and done things i prefer you didn't. i don't exactly have a reputation for being a thinker. i follow my blood, which doesn't exactly rush in the direction of my brain. so i make a lot of mistakes, a lot of wrong bloody calls.
scene direction: spike looks into her eyes
spike: a 100+ years, and there's only one thing i've ever been sure of: you.
scene direction: spike buffy looks away; he reaches toward her face
spike: hey, look at me. i'm not asking you for anything. when i say, "i love you," it's not because i want you or because i can't have you. it has nothing to do with me.
scene direction: spike a tear rolls down buffy's cheek
spike: i love what you are, what you do, how you try. i've seen your kindness and your strength. i've seen the best and the worst of you. and i understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are. you're a hell of a woman. you're the one, buffy.
scene direction: buffy quietly
buffy: i don't wanna be the one.
spike: i don't wanna be this good looking and athletic. we all have crosses to bear.
scene direction: spike buffy chuckles
spike: you get some rest now. i'll check in before first light. you can decide how you want...
scene direction: spike walks toward the door
buffy: spike?
scene direction: buffy he turns to face her
buffy: could you...stay here?
spike: sure.
scene direction: spike looks at a chair
spike: that diabolical old torture device, the comfy chair.
scene direction: spike takes off his coat
spike: it'll do me fine.
buffy: no, i mean...here.
scene direction: buffy touches the bed beside her
buffy: will you just hold me?
scene direction: spike sits on the bed beside buffy and puts his arm around her. she curls up on him, cuddling up to his chest as he puts his arm around her shoulder, holding her head with his hand.
scene direction: cut to 22 int. buffy's room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: the mayor/first is talking to faith.
first [mayor]: deep down, you always wanted buffy to accept you, to love you even. why do you think that is?
faith: you a shrink now?
scene direction: first [mayor] pacing
first [mayor]: you keep looking for love and acceptance from these people, these friends of yours, but you're never gonna find it. the truth is, nobody will ever love you. not the way i love you.
faith: get out.
first [mayor]: they'll forever see you as a killer.
faith: i said get out.
first [mayor]: i'll always be with you, firecracker, in everything you do.
scene direction: first [mayor] disappears in a flash of light
scene direction: robin touches faith's shoulder
robin: faith?
scene direction: faith startled
faith: you shouldn't sneak up like that! i almost took your head off!
robin: sorry, i knocked.

faith: lucky me. i'm a player.
scene direction: faith holds out her hand
faith: man, look at that. my hand's shaking. demons, vampires, women in the penitentiary system—none of that freaks me out.
robin: that's exactly what the first does—finds your achilles' heel.

faith: sorry.
scene direction: robin nods
robin: yeah.
faith: i'm just so pissed off at myself. i knew it was a trick.

scene direction: robin blinks, sits up
robin: in a manly way, of course.
faith: of course.
robin: listen, nobody wants to be alone, faith. we all want someone who cares, to be touched that way.

faith: when it came to you, did the first tell the truth?
robin: yeah.

robin: well, what do you think?
scene direction: faith paces
faith: could be. i mean, we've given her pretty good reason to be pissed off. you know the messed up thing? the first is telling me to worry about her, and i just wish she was here. in a couple hours, i'm gonna lead these girls into some serious crap, and she's the only one—
scene direction: robin exasperated
robin: she's not the only one. you're a slayer too, faith, and i think you're a good leader.
faith: i'm an ex-con who didn't finish high school.
robin: yeah, well i'm the principal of a school where nobody finished, and i am completely out of my league in this.
