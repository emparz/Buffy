scene direction: the bronze. a girl is screaming. a vampire is advancing on buffy as she backs into a pole. she throws a solid right to his face followed by a left. the vampire isn't fazed, and he grabs her and throws her onto a pool table. he leans over her to bite. xander comes up behind the vampire, grabs him by the shoulders and pulls him off of buffy.
xander: may i cut in?
scene direction: he bashes the vampire's head into the pool table, turns him around and punches him in the gut and the face. the vampire falls to the floor, unconscious. buffy is impressed and gives him a big smile. xander offers her his hand to help her off of the pool table.
xander: you alright?
scene direction: buffy exhales
buffy: thanks to you!
scene direction: she slides off of the table and notices xander's hand.
buffy: you hurt your hand! will you still be able to...
xander: ...finish my solo and kiss you like you've never been kissed before?
scene direction: he gives her a wink and starts back to the stage. the vampire gets back up and growls at buffy. xander sees him, breaks the leg off of a chair that's been knocked over and throws the makeshift stake at the vampire.
scene direction: buffy watches the stake fly into the vampire's chest, and he falls dead.
scene direction: she turns her gaze back on xander. he jumps up onto stage and grabs his guitar to continue his solo. buffy looks up at him adoringly and advances to the stage as he plays.
buffy: you're drooling.
scene direction: xander gives her a confused look.
scene change: cut to science class. it's dark because dr. gregory is giving a slide show.
buffy: xander!
scene direction: he wakes up from his daydream and shakes his head. buffy indicates the corner of her mouth.
buffy: you've got a little...
scene direction: he picks up on her gesture and quickly wipes the drool off of his mouth and chin.
dr. gregory: their ancestors were here long before we were. their progeny will be here long after we are gone. the simple and ubiquitous ant.
scene direction: he turns off the projector, turns the lights on and begins walking up the aisle.
dr. gregory: now. if you read the homework you should know the two ways that ants communicate.
scene direction: he stops at xander's lab table and leans on it to face buffy.
dr. gregory: miss summers.
buffy: ways that ants communicate.
scene direction: dr. gregory nodding his head
dr. gregory: mm.
buffy: with other ants.
dr. gregory: from the homework.
scene direction: willow tries to get buffy's attention.
dr. gregory: ants are communicating...
scene direction: buffy sees willow's signals
buffy: um, uh, uh...
scene direction: willow strokes xander's back, indicating 'touch'.
buffy: touch...
scene direction: dr. gregory nodding
dr. gregory: mm-hm.
buffy: and, um...
scene direction: she looks at willow again. she is sniffing xander, indicating 'smell'.
scene direction: buffy confused
buffy: b.o.?
scene direction: several students laugh. willow gives her a disappointed look.
blayne: thank god someone finally found the courage to mention that!
dr. gregory: that would be touch and smell, miss summers. is there anything else miss rosenberg would like to tell you?
scene direction: willow quickly turns away in her seat. the bell rings. dr. gregory starts to move back to the front of the class.
dr. gregory: alright, chapters six through eight by tomorrow, people.
scene direction: dr. gregory stops and looks back at buffy
dr. gregory: can i see you for a moment?
scene change: buffy nods. cut to after the other students have left the room. buffy leans against a lab table. dr. gregory idly reviews his slides.
dr. gregory: i gather you had a few problems at your last school?
buffy: well, what teenager doesn't?
dr. gregory: cut school, get in fights, burn down the gymnasium...
scene direction: principal flutie showed me your permanent record.
scene direction: he walks to the front of the class, and buffy follows him.
buffy: well, that fire, i mean, there was major extenuating circumstances. actually, it's, uh, kinda funny!
dr. gregory: can't wait to see what you're gonna do *here*.
scene direction: he goes to the closet, gets his other glasses from his coat and cleans them.
buffy: destructo girl. that's me.
dr. gregory: but i suspect it's gonna be great.
buffy: you mean, 'great' in a bad way?
scene direction: dr. gregory looks at her, then back at his glasses
dr. gregory: you have a first- rate mind and you can think on your feet. imagine what you could accomplish if you actually did the...
buffy: ...the homework thing.
dr. gregory: the homework thing. i understand you probably have a good excuse for not doing it.
scene direction: dr. gregory closes the closet and walks back to his lab table
dr. gregory: amazingly enough, i don't care. i know you can excel in this class, and so i expect no less. is that clear?
buffy: yeah! sorry.
dr. gregory: don't be sorry, be smart.
scene direction: dr. gregory looks at another slide
dr. gregory: and please don't listen to the principal or anyone else's negative opinion about you. let's make 'em eat that permanent record. whadaya say?
scene direction: he looks up at buffy and gives her a little smile. she smiles back.
buffy: okay! thanks.
scene direction: he nods his head. she grabs her bag.
dr. gregory: chapters six through eight!
scene change: buffy looks back at him with a smile and leaves the classroom. dr. gregory puts the slide down, goes over to turn off the lights and comes back to his slide-viewing plate. while he concentrates on the slides, the closet door opens. cut to a view of dr. gregory from the closet. the camera advances on him. cut in front of him. he's concentrating on the slides. cut behind him. a large, green mantis claw goes around his neck.
scene direction: dr. gregory looks up behind him and screams. the claw drags him off of his chair. his glasses hit the floor and break, and an instant later so does he.
scene direction: opening credits roll. buffy's theme plays.
scene change: *** part 1 ***
scene direction: the bronze. the live band is superfine, playing "already met you".
scene direction: xander dances lamely through the crowd.
lyrics: the first date's the worst date / it's hard to know just what to do / and i take you to dinner / you don't eat, you just play with your food.
scene direction: xander is on the dance floor and looks around. he makes his way to the stage and gives the singer an acknowledging nod and grin.
lyrics: and there's something familiar...
scene direction: the singer gives him a 'get outta here' look.
lyrics: about every word you say.
scene direction: xander is disappointed and moves away from the stage.
lyrics: it's hard to believe it's happened again / i already met you / and i already met you / you're like my last girlfriend / yes, and the girlfriend i had before her.
scene direction: xander goes over to the bar where blayne and his friend are sitting.
blayne: seven, including cheryl. i'll tell you, though, her sister was lookin' to make it eight!
boy: ooo, cheryl's sister? the one in college?
scene direction: blayne nods
blayne: home for the holidays and lookin' for love! she's not my type, though. girls really gotta have something to go with me.
scene direction: xander interrupting
xander: something like a lobotomy?
scene direction: the two boys look at him.
blayne: xander. how many times you score?
xander: well, uh...
blayne: it's just a question.
xander: are we talking today, or the whole week?
scene direction: the two boys snicker. xander spots buffy and willow coming down the stairs.
xander: ooo! duty calls!
scene direction: he leaves the bar and approaches the girls as blayne and his friend watch.
xander: babes!
scene direction: the girls look back at him. he comes up to them with his arms wide open and grabs them both around the shoulders.
buffy: what are you doing?
scene direction: xander to buffy
xander: work with me here. blayne had the nerve to question my manliness. i'm just gonna give him a visual.
scene direction: willow throws her arms around him tightly
willow: we'll show him!
scene direction: xander looks back at blayne, gives him a thumbs up and puts his arm back around willow. the two boys seem impressed.
scene direction: buffy distracted
buffy: i don't believe it.
xander: i know, and after all my conquests.
scene direction: buffy sees angel and goes over to him.
xander: who's that?
willow: that must be angel! i think?
xander: that weird guy that warned her about all the vampires?
willow: that's him, i'll bet you.
xander: well, he's buff! she never said anything about him being buff!
willow: you think he's buff?
xander: he's a very attractive man! how come that never came up?
scene change: cut to angel. buffy comes up to him.
buffy: well! look who's here!
angel: hi.
buffy: i'd say it's nice to see you, but then we both know that's a big fib.
angel: i won't be long.
buffy: no, you'll just give me a cryptic warning about some exciting new catastrophe, and then disappear into the night. right?
angel: you're cold.
buffy: you can take it.
scene direction: angel takes off his jacket
angel: i mean, you look cold.
scene change: he puts his jacket around her shoulders. cut to willow and xander.
xander: oh, right! give her your jacket. it's a balmy night, no one needs to be trading clothing out there!
scene change: cut to buffy and angel.
buffy: a little big on me.
scene direction: buffy notices a series of cuts on angel's arm
buffy: what happened?
angel: i didn't pay attention.
buffy: to somebody with a big fork?
angel: he's coming.
buffy: the fork guy?
angel: don't let him corner you. don't give him a moment's mercy. he'll rip your throat out.
buffy: okay, i'll give you improved marks for that one. ripping a throat out, it's a strong visual, it's not cryptic!
angel: i have to go.
scene direction: angel leaves
scene direction: buffy stares after him
buffy: sweet dreams to you, too.
scene change: cut to sunnydale high the next morning. buffy and giles are walking along in front of the school. giles is eating an apple.
giles: that's all he said? fork guy?
buffy: that's all cryptic guy said: fork guy.
giles: i think there are too many guys in your life.
scene direction: giles laughs
scene direction: they meet willow sitting on a bench.
giles: i'll see what i can find out.
scene direction: giles looks up at the sky
giles: god, every day here is the same.
buffy: bright, sunny, beautiful, however can we escape this torment?
scene direction: willow gives her a smile. buffy puts down her bag and sits down next to her.
giles: really.
scene direction: xander comes up behind giles as he turns to leave.
giles: good morning.
xander: mornin'.
scene direction: xander to the girls
xander: guess what i just heard in the office? no dr. gregory today. ergo, those of us who blew off our science homework aren't as dumb as we look.
scene direction: he reaches down and flips willow's book closed. she has to stop it from sliding off of her lap.
buffy: what happened, is he sick?
xander: they didn't say anything about sick, something about missing.
buffy: he's missing?
xander: well, let me think. um, the cheerleaders were modeling their new short skirts, that kinda got... yeah! yeah, they said missing.
scene direction: willow and buffy exchange a look.
xander: which is bad?
buffy: if something's wrong, yeah!
willow: he's one of the only teachers that doesn't think buffy's a felon.
xander: i'm really sorry, i'm sure he'll...
scene direction: he looks up and sees miss natalie french walking toward them.
xander: i, uh, huh...
scene direction: the girls look to see what's distracting him.
xander: uh, huh... huh...
scene change: cut to a slow motion shot of natalie walking. she comes right up to xander, who just stares at her.
natalie: could you help me?
xander: uuuuuuhhhhhh... yes!
scene direction: willow and buffy give each other amused looks.
natalie: i'm looking for science... 109.
xander: oh! it's, um...
scene direction: he looks around himself, trying to remember the way. he turns back to natalie.
scene direction: xander smiles
xander: i go there every day!
scene direction: natalie laughs.
scene direction: xander looks to the girls for help
xander: oh, god, where is it?
scene direction: willow and buffy just shrug. blayne appears behind natalie and introduces himself.
blayne: hi! blayne mall. i'm going there right now. it's not far from the varsity field where i took all-city last year.
scene direction: blayne smiles smugly
natalie: oh! thank you, blayne!
scene direction: she and blayne leave. xander's gaze follows them for a moment, and then he turns back to willow and buffy.
xander: it's funny how the earth never opens up and swallows you when you want it to.
scene direction: the girls nod their heads and give each other a smile.
scene change: cut to science class. natalie is writing her name on the board. buffy, willow and xander walk in. buffy spots dr. gregory's glasses on the floor and picks them up.
willow: what's wrong?
buffy: dr. gregory dropped his glasses... why wouldn't he pick them up?
scene direction: she sets the glasses on the lab table and gives natalie a glance as she walks to her stool. natalie faces the class.
natalie: my name is natalie french, and i will be substituting for dr. gregory.
buffy: do you know when he's coming back?
natalie: no, i don't, um,
scene direction: natalie checks her roster
natalie: buffy. they just call and tell me where they want me.
scene direction: blayne in a low voice
blayne: i'll tell you where i want you.
natalie: excuse me, blayne?
blayne: uh, i was just wondering if you were gonna pick up where dr. gregory left off.
scene direction: natalie smiles
natalie: yes. his notes tell me you were right in the middle of insect life.
scene direction: she picks up a mantis mounted in a clear plastic box.
natalie: the praying mantis is a fascinating creature. forced to live alone. who can tell me why? buffy?
scene direction: she puts the mantis back down.
buffy: well, the words 'bug-ugly' kinda spring to mind.
scene direction: there's lots of muffled laughter.
natalie: there is nothing ugly about these unique creatures. the reason they live alone is because they're cannibals!
buffy: eww!
scene direction: everyone in class looks disgusted.
natalie: oh, well, it's hardly their fault! it's the way nature designed them: noble, solitary and prolific. over 1800 species worldwide, and in nearly all of them the female is larger *and* more aggressive than the male.
scene direction: blayne to buffy
blayne: nothing wrong with an aggressive female.
scene direction: buffy angles her head and gives him a look. natalie picks up her notebook and starts to walk around the room.
natalie: the california mantis lays her eggs, and then finds a mate...
scene direction: she looks at xander. he stares back.
natalie: ...to fertilize them. once he's played his part, she covers the eggs in a protective sack and attaches it to a leaf or twig out of danger. now, if she's done her job correctly, in a few months she'll have several hundred offspring.
scene direction: she has made her way back to the front of the class and puts down her notebook.
natalie: you know, we should make some model egg sacks for the science fair. who would like to help me do that after school?
scene direction: all the boys raise their hands.
scene direction: natalie pleased
natalie: good!
scene change: cut to the cafeteria. buffy, willow and xander are in line.
buffy: hot dog surprise. be still, my heart.
willow: call me old-fashioned, i don't want any more surprises in my hot dogs.
xander: i wonder what she sees in me? it's probably the quiet good looks coupled with a certain smoky magnetism.
scene direction: willow raises her eyebrows at him. she turns to buffy and they smile.
xander: miss french. you two're probably a little young to understand what an older woman would see in a younger man.
buffy: oh, i understand.
xander: good!
buffy: the younger man is too dumb to wonder why an older woman can't find someone her own age, and too desperate to care about the surgical improvements!
xander: what surgical improvements?
willow: well, he is young.
buffy: and so terribly innocent!
xander: hey, those that can, do. those that can't *laugh* at those who... can do.
scene direction: blayne comes up next to xander, getting lots of food.
blayne: gotta carb up for my one-on-one with miss french today. when's yours? oh, right, tomorrow. you came in second, i came in first. guess that's what they call natural selection.
scene direction: blayne leaves
xander: guess it's what they call a rehearsal!
scene direction: xander to the girls
scene direction: rehearsal... (laughs lamely)
scene direction: the girls smile. buffy goes over to get some utensils. as she walks back cordelia comes in through the exit and bumps into her.
scene direction: cordelia to buffy
cordelia: excuse you!
scene direction: she goes behind the counter, showing a piece of paper to the cafeteria workers.
cordelia: medically prescribed lunch. my doctor ships it daily... i'll only be here as long as i can hold my breath.
scene direction: she opens a refrigerator and screams. inside is a headless body. buffy and willow run to see what's wrong. cordelia backs away from the fridge.
cordelia: his head! his head! oh, my god, where's his head?!
scene direction: buffy and willow arrive to see what's inside. buffy stares in disbelief.
scene direction: xander is close behind and has to look away when he sees. willow looks squeamish. the name on the body's lab coat is 'dr. gregory'.
scene change: cut to the library. giles pours a glass of water. he brings it over to buffy, who is sitting on the steps with willow. both girls have deeply sad looks on their faces. buffy has been crying.
scene direction: giles hands the glass to buffy
giles: here. drink this.
scene direction: buffy takes the glass
buffy: no, thank you.
scene direction: buffy takes a sip
scene direction: xander behind giles
xander: i've never seen...
scene direction: giles looks back at xander.
xander: i mean, i've never seen anything like... that was new.
willow: who would wanna hurt dr. gregory?
giles: uh, he didn't have any enemies on the staff that i'm aware of. he was a civilized man. i liked him.
buffy: so did i.
scene direction: willow looks up at giles
willow: well, we're gonna find out who did this.
scene direction: we'll find them and we'll stop them.
buffy: count on it.
giles: what do we know?
buffy: oh, not a lot, um...
scene direction: buffy sniffs and wipes a tear from her nose
buffy: he was killed here on campus. i'm guessing the last day we saw him.
giles: how do you work that out?
buffy: he didn't change his clothing.
xander: this is a question that no one particularly wants to hear, but... where did they put his head?
willow: good point. i didn't wanna hear that.
buffy: angel!
scene direction: buffy gets up
buffy: he warned me that something was coming.
scene direction: she takes another sip of water as she walks over to the table.
giles: yes. yes he did, didn't he? i wish i knew what he meant. i've been trying to gather more information about the master, our, uh, local vampire king. there was one oblique reference to a, a, a vampire who displeased the master and cut his hand off in penance.
buffy: cut off his hand and replaced it with a fork?
giles: i don't know what he replaced it with.
xander: so, why would he come after a teacher?
giles: i'm not certain he did. there was an incident two nights ago...
scene direction: he walks over to the counter, picks up a newspaper and returns with it.
giles: ...uh, involving a homeless person in weatherly park. he was practically shredded, but, uh, nothing like dr. gregory.
scene direction: buffy looks at the paper
buffy: fork guy doesn't do heads.
giles: not historically.
buffy: and dr. gregory's blood wasn't drained.
xander: so there's something else out there? besides silverwareman? oh, this is fun, we're on monster island.
buffy: we're on a hellmouth. it's a center of mystical convergence. guess it's the same thing.
scene direction: buffy walks toward xander
giles: well, unpleasant things do gravitate here, it's true, but, uh, we don't know there's anything besides this chap. he's still our likely suspect.
buffy: where was that guy killed? weatherly park?
giles: buffy.
scene direction: giles advances toward her
giles: i know you're upset, but, uh, this is no time to go hunting, not until we know more. please promise me you won't do anything rash?
buffy: cross my heart.
scene change: cut to the park at night. buffy climbs the fence. she walks through the park, carefully looking around. a bum comes up to her.
bum: shouldn't be out here at night, little lady. dangerous.
scene direction: the bum leaves. she notices another bum on the ground in front of a bench, and she checks him out. he's okay, just asleep. buffy continues stalking. dogs bark in the distance. buffy finds some shrubbery covering a sewer access hole. she moves it aside, and fork guy jumps out at her.
scene direction: she rushes backward. he swings with his claw, but misses. she slams her straight arm into his gut, then again into his back. he swings again, but buffy dodges him. she backhand punches him in the face, does a roundhouse kick to his jaw and backhand punches his face again. he takes another swing at buffy, but she evades it. she front kicks him. he lunges at her, and she grabs his arm and flips him over onto his back.
scene direction: buffy tries to stake him, but he rolls away and back onto his feet. she kicks him again and he staggers backward and falls. buffy hears voices and turns to see people with flashlights coming over the hill.
voices: hold it! police! did you see that? i got nothing here!
scene direction: buffy looks back and forth between fork guy and the posse. the vampire runs off.
voices: i heard it. spread out. let's go over here. this way, this way. alright...
scene direction: buffy makes tracks after the vampire.
scene change: cut to the fence at the edge of the park. natalie is walking home on the other side with grocery bags in her arms. the vampire stalks her and climbs over the fence. buffy comes running up. the vampire lands behind natalie. buffy reaches the fence and watches. natalie senses the vampire, stops and turns to face him. the vampire hisses and runs away in fear. natalie watches him go. buffy can't believe what she's seeing.
scene direction: the vampire crosses the street, lifts a manhole cover and climbs down.
scene direction: natalie continues her walk home. the vampire pulls the manhole cover back into place. buffy just stares after natalie.
scene change: *** part 2 ***
scene change: sunnydale high, the next morning. cut to the library.
giles: you went hunting last night.
buffy: yes.
scene direction: he walks into his office. she follows behind him.
giles: when you assured me you wouldn't.
scene direction: giles takes a sip from his mug
buffy: yes, i lied, i'm a bad person, let's move on.
scene direction: giles opens his file cabinet
giles: did you see someone with a fork?
buffy: more like a jumbo claw.
scene direction: giles turns to face her
giles: oh. well, uh, at least you're not hurt.
buffy: and i saw something else. something much more interesting than your average run-of-the-mill killer vampire.
giles: oh?
buffy: do you know miss french, the teacher that's subbing for dr. gregory?
scene direction: giles smiles
giles: yes. yes, she's lovely. in a, a common, extremely well proportioned way.
scene direction: giles puts some files away
buffy: well, i'm chasing claw guy last night, and miss well proportioned is heading home. the claw guy takes one look at her and runs screaming for cover.
scene direction: giles confused
giles: he what? ran away?
buffy: he was petrified.
giles: of miss french?
buffy: uh, huh! so i'm an undead monster that can shave with my hand... how many things am i afraid of?
giles: not many. and not substitute teachers, as a rule.
buffy: so what's her deal?
giles: i think perhaps it would be a good idea if we kept an eye on her.
buffy: then i better get to class.
scene direction: she leaves the office.
scene change: cut to buffy rushing down the stairs in the halls. she is stopped by principal flutie.
mr. flutie: you were there. you saw dr. gregory, didn't you?
buffy: um, you mean yesterday in the cafeteria when we found him...
mr. flutie: don't say dead! or decapitated, or decomposing, i'd stay away from d-words altogether. but you witnessed the event, so this way, please.
scene direction: mr. flutie starts down the hall
scene direction: buffy stops him short
buffy: well, no, i'm gonna be late for biology...
mr. flutie: extremely late!
scene direction: mr. flutie starts down the hall again
mr. flutie: you have to see a counselor. everyone who saw the body has to see a crisis counselor.
buffy: but i really don't need...
mr. flutie: we all need help with our feelings. otherwise we bottle them up, and before you know it, powerful laxatives are involved. i really believe if we all reach out to one another we can beat this thing. i'm always here if you need a hug,
scene direction: mr. flutie jumps back
mr. flutie: but not a real hug! because there's no touching, this school is sensitive to wrong touching.
buffy: but, i really, really don't...
mr. flutie: no, you have to talk to a counselor and start the healing. you have to heal.
buffy: but mr. flutie, i...
mr. flutie: heal!
scene direction: he sits her down in a chair outside of the counselor's office and paces off. buffy leans back in the chair and looks bummed. then she hears cordelia inside the office.
cordelia: i don't know what to say, it was really, i mean, one minute you're in your normal life, and then who's in the fridge?
scene direction: cordelia the camera pans over to show her inside
cordelia: it really gets to you, a thing like that.
scene direction: cordelia cut inside
cordelia: it was... let's just say i haven't been able to eat a thing since yesterday. i think i lost, like, seven and a half ounces? way swifter than that so-called diet that quack put me on. oh, i'm not saying that we should kill a teacher every day just so i can lose weight, i'm just saying when tragedy strikes, we have to look on the bright side. you know?
scene change: cut to buffy. what she's hearing is just too weird.
cordelia: like, how even used mercedes still have leather seats!
scene change: cut to science class. natalie is giving a pop quiz, and is walking along the aisle.
natalie: keep your eyes straight ahead on your own test.
scene direction: she comes up behind xander.
scene direction: natalie in a low voice
natalie: i think you meant 'pollination' for number fourteen.
scene direction: natalie puts her hand on his shoulder
natalie: i'll see you here after school.
scene change: cut to the hall. buffy comes running to class and looks in through the door window.
buffy: oh, great, a pop quiz.
scene direction: cut inside. natalie suddenly straightens up. buffy looks in. she sees natalie turn her head around 180 degrees. her eyes go wide with amazement. she quickly rolls away from the window.
scene change: cut to the library. buffy and willow come in.
buffy: no, i'm not saying she craned her neck. we are talking full on exorcist twist.
willow: ouch!
buffy: which reminds me, how come blayne, who worked with her one-on- one yesterday, isn't here today?
willow: inquiring minds wanna know.
scene direction: buffy to giles
buffy: any luck?
scene direction: willow sits down in front of the pc and begins a search.
giles: um, i've not found any creature as yet that strikes terror in a vampire's heart.
buffy: try looking under things that can turn their heads all the way around.
giles: nothing human can do that.
buffy: no, nothing human. there are some insects that can. whatever she is, i'm gonna be ready for her.
scene direction: she turns and hops up the stairs to the stacks. giles takes off his glasses.
giles: what are you going to do?
scene direction: buffy turns back to answer
buffy: my homework.
scene direction: she continues up into the stacks. willow looks up at her and smiles, then continues her search. buffy comes running back.
buffy: where are the books on bugs?
scene change: cut to the science classroom. natalie is at the desk spreading butter on a slice of bread. she's about to open a plastic container when she hears xander come in and looks up.
xander: hi!
natalie: oh, hi! i was just grabbing a snack. can i fix you something?
xander: no thanks, i never... eat when i'm making egg sacks.
scene direction: xander sees the model
xander: wow, if this were real the bugs would be...
natalie: ...as big as you!
xander: yeah! so! where do we start?
natalie: oh, xander!
scene direction: natalie gets up
natalie: i've done something really stupid. i hope you can forgive me.
xander: oh, forgiveness is my middle name! well, actually it's lavelle, and i'd appreciate it if you guard that secret with your life.
scene direction: xander laughs
scene direction: natalie laughs
natalie: i have a teacher's conference in half an hour, and i left the paint and papier-mache' at home. i don't suppose you'd like to come to my place tonight to work on it there?
scene direction: xander swallows
xander: come to, uh... your place?
scene direction: he flashes to his guitar solo for a moment.
natalie: 7:30? here's my address.
scene direction: natalie writes it down
scene direction: xander can't believe his luck.
scene direction: natalie hands him her address
natalie: i'll see you tonight?
scene direction: xander in a high, squeaky voice
xander: yeah!
scene change: cut to the hall. xander comes out of the classroom.
scene direction: xander pumping his fists into the air
xander: ooo, yes!
scene direction: cut inside the classroom. natalie opens the container now. it's full of crickets. she dumps them onto the buttered bread and folds the slice in half. she takes a bite. crunchy!
scene change: cut to the library. buffy comes out of the stacks with a book.
buffy: dig this: 'the praying mantis can rotate its head 180 degrees while waiting for its next meal to walk by.'
scene direction: buffy slams the book shut
buffy: ha!
scene direction: buffy silence
buffy: well, c'mon, guys. ha!
willow: well, miss french is sort of big. for a bug?
giles: and she is, by and large, woman shaped.
scene direction: buffy makes her way down to them
buffy: okay. factoid 1: only the praying mantis can rotate its head like that. factoid 2: a pretty whacked-out vampire is scared to death of her. factoid 3: her fashion sense screams predator.
willow: it's the shoulder pads.
buffy: exactly.
giles: if you're right, then she'd have to be a shape-shifter or a perception distorter. on a helpful note, i had a chum at oxford, carlyle, advanced degrees in entomology mythology.
buffy: entomawho?
giles: bugs and fairy tales.
buffy: i knew that.
giles: if i recall correctly, poor old carlyle, just before he went mad, claimed there was some beast...
scene direction: willow the pc beeps
willow: buffy, 911! blayne's mom called the school. he never came home last night.
giles: the boy who worked with miss french yesterday?
willow: yeah! if miss french is responsible for... xander's supposed to be helping her right now! he's got a crush on a giant insect!
buffy: okay, don't panic, i'll warn him. but i need you to hack onto the coroner's office for me.
willow: well, what are we looking for?
buffy: autopsy on dr. gregory. i've been trying to figures out these marks that i saw on his corpse... i'm thinking they were teeth. and, uh, these cuddlies?
scene direction: buffy points to a picture of a mantis
buffy: should definitely be brushing after every meal.
scene direction: buffy willow types
scene direction: buffy to giles
buffy: and you were saying something about a beast?
scene direction: giles gets up to go to his office
giles: oh, uh, yeah, i just need to make one transatlantic telephone call.
scene direction: giles stops and turns back
giles: um, this computer invasion that willow's performing on the coroner's office, one, one assumes it is entirely legal?
scene direction: willow and buffy answer simultaneously.
willow: entirely!
buffy: of course!
giles: right. wasn't here, didn't see it, couldn't have stopped you.
buffy: good idea.
scene direction: cut outside. buffy catches up with xander.
buffy: hey!
xander: hey!
buffy: so, how'd it go with miss french?
xander: well, it's a bit demanding being her absolute favorite guy in the universe, but i'll muddle through.
buffy: xander, she's not what she seems.
xander: i know, she's so much more.
buffy: okay, um... i'm gonna have to tell you something about her, and i'm gonna need you to really listen, okay?
xander: okay.
buffy: i don't think she's human.
xander: i see. so if she's not human she's...
buffy: technically? a big bug.
scene direction: xander laughs.
buffy: this sounds really weird, i'm aware of that...
xander: it doesn't sound weird at all, i completely understand. i've met someone, and you're jealous.
buffy: what?
xander: look, there's nothing i can do about it. uh, there's just this certain chemical thing between miss french and me.
buffy: i know, i read all about it, it's call, um, a pheromone. it's a chemical attractant that insects give off.
xander: she's not an insect! she's a woman, okay? and hard as that may be for you to conceive, an actual woman finds me attractive. i realize it's no mystery guy handing out leather jackets, and while we're on the subject, what kind of a girlie name is 'angel' anyway?
buffy: what does that have to do with...
xander: nothing! it just kinda bugs me. look, i really gotta...
scene direction: he walks off. buffy turns and watches him go.
buffy: wha...?
scene change: cut to natalie's house that night. she pours two martinis. her dress shows lots of cleavage. the doorbell rings. she smiles and goes to open it.
natalie: hi! come on in!
scene direction: xander stares at her cleavage as he comes in.
natalie: should i change? is, is this too...
scene direction: natalie she closes the door
xander: no, no, it's, the most beautiful chest... dress i've ever seen.
scene direction: she smiles and goes back into the living room. xander follows.
natalie: thank you. that's sweet. martini?
scene direction: natalie offers him one
natalie: oh, i'm sorry, would you like something else?
scene direction: xander quickly accepts the drink.
scene direction: natalie laughs
natalie: i just need to relax a little, i'm kinda nervous around you.
scene direction: natalie she sits down
natalie: you're probably cool as a cucumber!
scene direction: xander sits down
xander: i like cucumbers. like in that greek salad thing with the yogurt. do you like greek food? i'm exempting schwarma, of course, i mean, what's that all about? it's a big meat hive.
scene direction: they laugh, he nervously, she playfully. xander gulps the martini.
xander: hhhhhhho! hello!
natalie: cheers!
scene direction: natalie clinks their glasses
natalie: can i ask you a personal question?
scene direction: she puts her glass down and gets closer to xander.
natalie: have you ever been with a woman before?
xander: you mean, like, in, uh, the same room?
natalie: you know what i mean.
xander: oh, that, uh... well, let me think. um...
scene direction: natalie runs her fingers though his hair and around his ear.
xander: yeah, there was, uh... several!
scene direction: she continues her stroke down to xander's chin.
xander: i mean, and, uh, quite a few times... and then there was, uh... oh, she was incredibly... no. uh-uh.
natalie: i know. i can tell.
xander: you can?
natalie: oh, i like it. you might say, i... *need* it.
xander: oh! well, needs should, uh, y'know... needs should definitely be met, as long as it doesn't require ointments the next day, or...
scene direction: muffled yelling can be heard from somewhere.
xander: do you hear...
natalie: no...
xander: sounds like someone crying...
natalie: i don't hear anything.
scene direction: natalie takes his hand
natalie: your hands are so hot!
scene direction: xander flashes to his dream.
buffy: oh, you hurt your hand!
scene direction: xander comes back. the drink is beginning to affect him. he leans back on the couch.
xander: buffy. i love buffy. wow! so that's a martini, huh?
natalie: mm-hm.
scene direction: xander sits back up
xander: do you hear...
scene direction: natalie interrupting
natalie: would you like to touch me with those hands?
scene direction: xander looks at natalie's hands
xander: your hands are sss... really...
scene direction: xander her hands morph
xander: serrated! oh, wow, that martini, i... i really think i have to...
scene direction: xander falls to the floor unconscious. two mantis claws drag him away by his feet.
scene change: *** part 3 ***
scene direction: natalie's basement. the camera pans down from the window above the stairs to xander. he's lying unconscious in a cage. there are squishing noises. xander wakes up, looks around, grabs the bars and pulls himself up. he sees natalie as a giant mantis preparing her nest.
xander: miss... french?
natalie: please, call me natalie.
scene direction: xander backs away into the cage.
scene change: cut to the library. giles is on the phone.
giles: frankly, madam, i haven't the faintest idea what time it is, nor do i care. now, unlock his cell, unstrap him, and bring him to the telephone immediately. this is a matter of life and death!
scene change: cut to willow typing.
willow: got it! coroner's report, complete with... yuk! ...color pictures.
buffy: there *are* teeth marks. which match perfectly the one insect that nips off its prey's head.
willow: okay, i-i don't like this.
buffy: huh! it's the way they feed, head first. it's also the way they mate. the female bites off the male's head while they're...
willow: no, no, no! see? xander's, i like his head! i-it's where you find his eyes, and his hair, and his adorable smile...
buffy: hey, hey, take it easy, willow. xander is not in any immediate danger. i saw him leave school. he's probably safe at home right now.
scene change: cut to natalie's basement. xander backs up in his cage and is surprised by blayne when he reaches the far corner.
xander: ah! blayne!
scene direction: blayne terrified
blayne: oh, god! oh, god!
xander: are you all right?
blayne: oh, god!
scene direction: blayne breathes
blayne: you gotta get me outta here! you gotta! she, she, she gets you, and, uh...
xander: what?
blayne: ...she, she...
xander: what does she do?
blayne: oh, god! oh, oh, no!
xander: blayne! what does she do?
blayne: she, she... she, she takes you outta the cage, and she ties you up, and, and... she... she starts movin', and throbbin', and these eggs come shootin' out of her! and then...
xander: what?
blayne: and then...
xander: then what?
blayne: she mates with you!
xander: sheeee...
blayne: that's not the worst part!
xander: that's not?
blayne: you seen her teeth? right while she's, you know, right in the middle of... i saw her do it! i don't wanna die like that!
xander: blayne! blayne! chill! it's okay. it's gonna be okay. we'll get outta this.
scene direction: blayne hopeful
blayne: you gotta plan? what is it?
xander: just, uh, let me perfect it!
scene direction: blayne gives up hope
blayne: oh, god... oh, god... oh, god...
scene change: cut to the library. giles is talking with carlyle on the phone in his office.
giles: i-i understand, carlyle. yes... i-i'll take every precaution. uh, absolutely, i-i-it sounds exactly like the creature you described. y-you were right all along about everything. well, n-no, you weren't right about your mother coming back as a pekinese, but... uh... try to rest, old man. yes... ta! bye now!
scene direction: he hangs up and comes out of his office. willow and buffy are at the pc.
giles: dr. ferris carlyle spent years transcribing a lost pre-germanic language. what he discovered he kept to himself until several teenage boys were murdered in the cotswolds. then he went hunting for it.
buffy: it being...
giles: uh, he calls her a she-mantis. this type of creature, the kleptes-virgo, or, or virgin-thief, appears in, in many cultures. the greek sirens, the celtic sea maidens, who, who tore the living flesh from the bones of, um...
buffy: giles, while we're young!
giles: uh, well, basically the, uh, the she-mantis assumes the form of a beautiful woman and then lures innocent virgins back to her nest.
buffy: virgins? well, xander's not a, uh... i mean, he's probably...
scene direction: willow quickly gets up, worried
willow: ...gonna die!
scene direction: willow goes to the phone
buffy: okay, okay,
scene direction: buffy walks around giles
buffy: so this thing is breeding and we need to find it and snuff it.
scene direction: buffy faces giles
buffy: any tips on the snuffing part?
giles: uh, carlyle recommends cleaving all body parts with a sharp blade.
scene direction: willow is on the phone in the background behind buffy talking to xander's mom.
buffy: slice and dice.
giles: well, whatever you do, it had better be certain and swift. this beast is extremely dangerous.
buffy: well, your buddy carlyle faced it, and he's still around.
giles: yes, in a straitjacket, howling his innards out day and night.
buffy: okay, admiral, way to inspire the troops!
giles: sorry...
scene direction: willow off the phone now
willow: xander's not home! he told his mom he was going to his teacher's house to work on a science project. he didn't tell her where.
scene direction: buffy to willow
buffy: see if you can get her address off the substitute rolls.
scene direction: buffy to giles
buffy: and you need to record bat sonar, and fast!
giles: bat sonar, right. what?
buffy: bats eat them.
scene direction: buffy leads giles to the stairs
buffy: the mantis hears sonar, its entire nervous system goes kaplooey.
giles: where am i gonna find the...
buffy: in the vid library? there're no books, but it's dark and musty, you'll feel right at home, go!
scene direction: buffy exhales
scene direction: buffy to herself
buffy: i guess i'll handle the armory.
scene change: cut to natalie's basement. xander and blayne are in their cages. xander is working on one of the bars.
blayne: don't do anything to make her mad!
scene direction: xander pulls the bar out.
scene direction: blayne brightens
blayne: hey, alright, now i can get outta my cage!
scene direction: blayne bummed
blayne: into yours, what'd you do that for?
xander: a weapon!
scene direction: blayne sees natalie coming
blayne: i think you're gonna need it.
scene direction: xander looks up and is startled. he drops the bar.
scene change: cut to the library. miss french's record is coming out of the printer.
scene direction: buffy comes in the door.
willow: getting the address.
buffy: great! giles?
scene direction: giles holding a tape recorder
giles: recording bat sonar is something soothingly akin to having one's teeth drilled.
scene direction: buffy takes the tape recorder
buffy: let's roll!
scene direction: they all head for the door.
willow: according to miss french's personnel records, she was born in 1907. she's, like, 90 years old!
giles: and extremely well-preserved!
scene change: cut to natalie's basement. she is looking back and forth between the boys.
blayne: oh, god!
scene direction: blayne goes through the hole into xander's cage
blayne: uh, he did that, he broke the cage, take him, not me, take him!
scene change: cut to giles, buffy and willow driving up to miss french's house. they get out and run up to the door.
giles: what now, exactly? we can't just kick the door down.
buffy: yeah, that *would* be wrong.
scene direction: she gets ready to kick, but the door opens. an old lady is there.
miss french: hello, dear! i thought i heard... are you selling something? because i'd like to help you out, but... you see, i'm on a fixed income.
buffy: i'm looking for miss french.
miss french: i'm miss french.
buffy: natalie french, the substitute biology teacher?
scene direction: miss french laughs
miss french: goodness, that's me! i taught for over thirty years. i retired in 1972.
scene direction: buffy to giles
buffy: i can't believe this! she used miss french's records to get into the school. she could be anywhere!
miss french: no, dear! i'm right here!
scene change: cut to natalie's basement.
xander: what's she doing?
blayne: i think it's eeny, meeny, miney...
xander: moe?
scene direction: the camera closes in on xander's terrified face.
scene change: *** part 4 ***
scene direction: natalie's basement. she opens the door to the cage. xander crawls out on his butt, bar in hand.
xander: i'm comin', i'm comin'.
scene direction: when he's just out of the cage he swings the bar and hits natalie as he gets up. she staggers. he runs for the stairs. halfway up natalie trips him with her claw, and he tumbles back down the stairs.
scene change: cut to miss french's house. giles, willow and buffy are going back to the car.
willow: what do we do now?
giles: abject prayer and supplication would spring to mind.
buffy: i saw her walking past this park with her grocery bags. she lives in this neighborhood.
willow: i'm gonna start banging on doors.
scene direction: willow heads for the next house
scene direction: buffy stops willow
buffy: wait, no, we do *not* have time for that!

scene direction: natalie is in his face.
blayne: oh, yeah, here it comes!
xander: what? what's happening?!
blayne: how do you like your eggs, bro, over easy or sunny side up?
xander: eggs? she's gonna lay some...
scene direction: he sees her lay some eggs. he flashes to natalie's lecture in science class.
natalie: the california mantis lays her eggs, and then finds a mate to fertilize them.
scene direction: his flashback is over, and he's scared.
scene change: cut to the manhole.
scene direction: willow into the hole
willow: come on, buffy!
scene change: cut to some bushes. there are sounds of claw guy swinging his arm and ropes whipping through the air. buffy pushes claw guy out of the bushes.
scene direction: his arms are tied behind his back.
claw guy: you!
buffy: me!
scene change: she shoves him down the street. cut to natalie's street. buffy is pushing claw guy down the sidewalk in front of her. giles and willow follow.
buffy: come on! come on, where is she? which house is it? i know you're afraid of her, i saw you! come on!
scene direction: claw guy begins to react to natalie's presence.
buffy: come on. what? what is it? this is her, isn't it, this is her house? this is it! better than radar!
scene direction: she lets go of him. claw guy cuts the ropes with his blades.
willow: buffy!
scene direction: he swings at buffy, but she leans back in time, only to trip and fall backward over the miniature picket fence running along the walk to the house. claw guy jumps to follow. she crawls backward on her butt until she hits the fence on the other side of the lawn. she rips a picket from the fence and thrusts it into claw guy as he takes another swing at her.
scene direction: he falls over dead. giles breathes a sigh of relief.
scene change: cut to the basement. natalie advances on xander.
natalie: kiss me!
scene direction: natalie laughs
natalie: kiss me!
xander: can i just say one thing? heeeellllp! heeeellllp!
scene direction: buffy smashes the basement window and slides in.
blayne: uh, hey, o-over here, hello! in the cage!
scene direction: she pulls her bag though the window.
scene direction: buffy to natalie
buffy: let him go!
scene direction: she runs down the stairs and sets the bag down. willow climbs in the window, too. buffy pulls two cans of insect spray from the bag and sprays natalie in the face. giles climbs in as willow runs behind buffy to open the cage. the spray disorients natalie. giles comes down the stairs now too. buffy points him at xander.
blayne: help me! help me!
scene direction: buffy to giles
buffy: get them outta here!
scene direction: she pulls the tape recorder and a machete from her bag.
blayne: hey, help me! help me!
scene direction: giles undoes the leather straps holding xander. natalie retreats to the back of her nest. buffy starts to close in on her.
buffy: remember dr. gregory? you scarfed his head? yeah, well, he taught me, you do your homework, you learn stuff. like what happens to your nervous system when you hear this!
scene direction: she plays the tape. it's giles' voice. buffy stares at the machine in disbelief.
tape: ...extremely important to file not simply alphabetically...
scene direction: buffy back to giles
buffy: giles!
scene direction: giles on the floor pointing at natalie
giles: i-it's the wrong side!
scene direction: natalie knocks the tape recorder and machete from buffy's hands. giles watches the recorder fly over him, hit the ground and slide under a refrigerator. he scrambles to get it. buffy turns her attention back on natalie. natalie tries to trip buffy, but she jumps over her claw.
scene direction: xander comes up next to her with a can of bug spray and sprays it into natalie's face. buffy pushes him away from danger, and natalie takes the opportunity to knock her down. buffy raises herself onto her hands and one leg, and with the other does two crouching sidekicks to natalie's legs to keep her at bay. giles searches under the refrigerator. buffy kicks again. she sees the machete on the floor and grabs it. giles has the recorder now, jumps around on the floor with the recorder in front of him and plays the tape. the sounds of bat sonar severely hurt and disorient natalie. she flails her claws around.
