scene direction: andrew sighs
andrew: you keep circling around. just?just drive straight in.
jonathan: will you shut up? we gotta keep it low pro.
andrew: you're just scared.

andrew: calm down. no one's getting flayed alive. we got a plan. we're gonna fix all that.
jonathan: wish i'd have stayed in mexico.
andrew: ah, i didn't like it there. everybody spoke mexicalan.
jonathan: you could've learned it. you learned the entire klingon dictionary in two and a half weeks.
andrew: that had much clearer transitive and intransitive rules, ok? besides, i can't keep having those nightmares.

dawn: kit, are you there? is there a storm?
scene direction: suddenly, the television is unmuted, playing loudly. she tries to mute it again, but the remote control button doesn't have any effect. she tries the power button on the television itself, but it doesn't work either. finally, she tries to unplug it, but the old movie still plays with the cord out of the wall. dawn's eyes grow wide with fear.
scene direction: cut to 31 ext. sunnydale cemetery - night
scene direction: buffy's still fighting the fledgling vampire. he's dressed in a nice black suit, wearing a light blue shirt and a tie. they're having quite a row, throwing each other against headstones and such. finally, the vampire pushes buffy back against a headstone and grabs her throat, going for the kill, when he stops, and speaks to her -

scene direction: dawn hangs up the phone and picks up the radio that was in the kitchen before. she shakes the radio. joyce is lying on the couch behind her in the same position as she was when buffy found her dead in episode 5x17 "the body".
scene direction: dawn crying
dawn: do it again! i heard you.
scene direction: dawn stops and turns slowly to look at the couch behind her, but it's empty. the lights go out for a second. when they come back on, dawn can see that all the dining room chairs have been placed upside down on the dining room table in the next room. the weapons chest has been turned on end, spilling its contents onto the floor. she looks around, frightened, and sees a message written on the wall in blood - "mother's milk is red today", and there's a bloody handprint below it. the lights dim again for only a moment, and when they come back on, the message is gone and the weapons chest and the dining room furniture are back in their normal configurations again. dawn shivers. there's a knocking sound - knock, knock, knock.
dawn: why are you doing this!
scene direction: knock.
dawn: why are you? i don't understand.
scene direction: dawn knocking continues
dawn: stop. stop it! stop it! stop it! aah!

andrew o.s.: aah!
scene direction: andrew, also clad in black, has fallen from the ceiling, not quite so adept with the ropes as jonathan. he lands flat on his face.

andrew: no, they'll see it from outside.
jonathan: right.
scene direction: they hear a noise coming from down the hall, like glass breaking. they turn to look.
jonathan: maybe we should go get buffy.
andrew: no way.
jonathan: we should just tell her what we know about this evil danthazar.
scene direction: andrew they start walking
andrew: think, mcfly. why would she believe us without any proof? we go to her empty-handed, and we'll be coolin' our heels in the clink in a bell's microsecond.
jonathan: i ain't goin' back to the big house. that place changes a man.
andrew: that's why we need proof. think of it as?as trial by fire. a quest.
jonathan: una questa.
andrew: we find it. we alert the slayer. we help her destroy it. we save sunnydale.
scene direction: andrew they stop walking
andrew: then we join her gang and possibly hang out at her house.
jonathan: right. ok. what do we do?
andrew: i think we should find the principal's office and work our way down from there.
jonathan: ok, uh, um, uh, you go check down the hallway
scene direction: jonathan points left
jonathan:  and i'll go over there.
scene direction: jonathan points right

jonathan: do you think they'll really let us join their gang?
scene direction: andrew shrugs. jonathan walks away. down the hall, warren walks out from behind some lockers and walks up to andrew...
warren: nice job.
andrew: there you are. i'm scared out of my frickin' gourd here.
scene direction: warren laughs
warren: take it easy. take it easy.
andrew: do you have any idea how hard it's been to act this cool?
warren: calm down, you're doing great. all specs are within parameters.
andrew: you keep leaving me. i hate it when you leave me. one time you died, and i ended up a mexican.
warren: we've been over this. now, that death thing was all part of the master plan. come on, "if you strike me down..."
scene direction: andrew doing an impression
andrew: "i shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine."
scene direction: andrew laughs
andrew: of course. do you think, maybe, willow could kill me, too?
warren: hey, don't worry. if short round pulls off his end of the bargain, we'll both become gods.
scene direction: andrew turns to look down hall where jonathan went
scene direction: andrew doing an impression
andrew: "that boy is our last hope."
scene direction: warren walks forward to stand beside andrew
warren: "no, there is another."
scene direction: andrew looks at warren
andrew: wait, really? who's our last hope?
warren: no, i was just going with it. it was a thing. he's our last hope.

willow: tara, is it you?
cassie: she's sorry she couldn't come herself.
willow: why didn't she? i don't understand... i mean, if you can manifest yourself
cassie: she just can't.
willow: why not? i don't understand.
cassie: because of what you did.

scene direction: cut to 40 ext. sunnydale cemetery - night
scene direction: buffy's lying down on her back on a stone sarcophagus. there's a carved stone open book at one end that she's using as a pillow. holden is sitting on a nearby headstone, talking to her. she's playing with the cross pendant on the necklace she's wearing.
holden: so, you meet someone, you form a bond...
buffy: but it never lasts.
holden: do you mean in all relationships, or just yours?
buffy: my parents weren't exactly the paragon of stay-togetherey-ness. maybe that's part of it. i think there're people out there who'd make it. i just... target the impossible ones... with deadly accuracy.
holden: you think you do that on purpose? maybe you're trying to protect yourself?
buffy: protecting myself? from heartbreak, misery, sexual violence, and possible death? not so much.
holden: from committing.
scene direction: buffy sits up
buffy: i commit. i'm committed. i'm a committee.
holden: so it's them? you're reaching out, they're just not coming through?
scene direction: buffy shifts her body
buffy: it's different. i think you're confusing me because you're evil.
holden: i just think you're in some pain here?which i do kind of enjoy 'cause i'm evil now?but you should just ease up on yourself. it's not exactly like you have the patent on bad relationships.
buffy: wouldn't it be cool if i did?
holden: and what are you?supposed to be settling down already? at 21? you know, my girlfriend at college, she's so sweet. we have this great thing, but that doesn't mean i'm gonna go vampify her just so we can be together forever.
buffy: sire.
holden: what?
buffy: the word?when you turn a human into a vampire?it's you "sire" them.
holden: cool.
buffy: it's a noun too.
scene direction: holden stands, leans on nearby headstone
holden: oh, i have so much to learn. come on, isn't this insane? i mean, i was afraid to talk to you in high school, and now we're, like, mortal enemies. hey, wouldn't it be cool if we became nemeses?
buffy: is that how you say the word?
holden: we're gonna have to fight to the death, aren't we?
buffy: it's the time-honored custom.
holden: wow, reality just shows up sometimes, doesn't it? but, you know, i've got the bloodlust pumping, and i kinda get it. i'm looking for a fight. and, oh, it's nothing personal.
scene direction: buffy stands
buffy: oh, no, i mean, you've been great.
holden: and fun catching up. i haven't really kept in contact with many of my friends from high school. guess i'll be looking them up pretty soon.
scene direction: holden laughs
scene direction: buffy looks down
buffy: yeah.
holden: hey, i don't mean to be count buttinsky here, but you just don't seem as thrilled. is it because we're gonna fight?
buffy: 's 'cause i'm gonna win.
scene direction: holden laughs
holden: hello. two years of tae kwon do and vampire strength. i think somebody's counting their chickens.
buffy: you're not leaving this graveyard.
scene direction: buffy shrugs
buffy: can't let ya.
holden: do the words "superiority complex" mean anything to you?
buffy: you think i'm gonna let you go kill a bunch of people? you know i'm sworn to?
holden: no, no. i get the battle against evil. that's not the issue?
buffy: there is no issue. don't issue me.
holden: just answer me this: whose fault was your parents divorce?
scene direction: buffy rolls eyes
buffy: ok, you know, this is beyond evil. this is insane troll logic. what do my parents have to do with?
scene direction: holden sits on sarcophagus
holden: i'm just curious. your opinion.
scene direction: buffy sighs, sits on sarcophagus next to him
buffy: they both have a lot of?
holden: off the top of your head.
scene direction: buffy hangs head
buffy: my dad.
holden: uh-huh.
buffy: he cheated. um, i think he cheated.
holden: so, of all of these relationships of yours?that you knew subconsciously were totally doomed?whose fault is that?
buffy: it's incredibly different.
holden: i was just wondering,
scene direction: holden stands
holden: is it possible, even a little bit, that the reason you have trouble connecting to guys is because you think maybe they're not worth it? maybe you think you're better than them.
scene direction: buffy glares
buffy: say, there's that bloodlust i was looking for.
holden: struck a nerve.
buffy: i'm gonna strike a nerve cluster in a minute, you don't get off this. i don't remember you being this annoying.
holden: you don't remember me at all.
buffy: yes, i do.
holden: yeah, like, after 30 minutes of reminding. and i don't take it personally because clearly you were in your own little world in high school. all chosen. all destiny. who could live with that for seven years and not feel superior?
buffy: i'm not. my god, if anything, i?
scene direction: buffy hangs head
holden: what?
buffy: i just
scene direction: buffy sighs
buffy: if you knew what i've done, what i've let myself become. my best friends don't even?you'd laugh, you heard some of the things i've done to them.
scene direction: holden sits on nearby headstone
holden: buffy, i'm here to kill you, not to judge you.
buffy: the last guy i was with, it got really? i behaved like a monster, treated him like? but at the same time, i-i let him completely take me over. do things to me that?
scene direction: buffy starts to cry, holden stands
buffy: i'm sorry.
scene direction: buffy wipes eyes
buffy: wow, i didn't mean to get all true-confessions there. i don't know what's wrong with me.
scene direction: holden walks forward to inspect a figurine of mary that adorns a nearby tombstone. he picks up mary.
holden: there's nothing wrong with you.
scene direction: holden hits buffy in the head with the mary statue, sending buffy across the sarcophagus in a flip. holden jumps over the tomb and lands in front of buffy, grabbing her jacket, and talking right in her face in his vampire visage.
holden: everyone's got issues.

cassie: it was the power.
willow: i am the power. it's in me. did i mention the random destruction of property? the magic box is not so much a box now?
cassie: the power is bigger than you are.
willow: i know, but?
cassie: things are more clear where tara is, where we are. we can see your path, and you have to stop. you can't use magic again, not ever.
willow: black magic, of course. but giles says it isn't as simple as-as quitting it all cold-turkey?
cassie: it's too dangerous. you can't take the chance that you'll lose control.
willow: i-i don't want to. i-i can't. i never want to cause that kind of pain.
cassie: of course you don't.

andrew: you know what? they don't wanna talk to you?all those people you just mentioned. not one of them is sitting around going, "i wonder what jonathan's up to right now." not one of them cares about you.

holden: didn't you?
buffy: i have all this power. i didn't ask for it. i don't deserve it. it's like... i wanted to be punished. i wanted to hurt like i thought i deserved. i sorta think?you know, this is, um, complicated. if you'd rather just fight...
scene direction: holden leans back
holden: tell me.
buffy: i feel like i'm worse than anyone. honestly, i'm beneath them. my friends, my boyfriends. i feel like i'm not worthy of their love. 'cause even though they love me, it doesn't mean anything 'cause their opinions don't matter. they don't know. they haven't been through what i've been through. they're not the slayer. i am. sometimes i feel
scene direction: buffy sighs
buffy: this is awful?i feel like i'm better than them. superior.

scene direction: holden laughs
holden: kudos.
buffy: it doesn't make any sense.
