scene direction: the master's lair. collin is tossing stones into the pool. he takes a few more from the master's hand. darla comes into the lair.
master: zachary didn't return from the hunt last night.
darla: the slayer.
master: zachary was strong, and he was careful. and still the slayer takes him... as she has taken so many of my family.
scene direction: master takes a breath
master: it wears thin. collin, what would you do about it?
collin: i'd annihilate her.
scene direction: master inhales
master: out of the mouths of babes...
scene direction: darla makes her way down
darla: let me do it, master. let me kill her for you.
master: you have a personal interest in this.
darla: i don't get to have any fun.
master: i will send the three.
darla: the three?
scene change: cut to an alley. three tough guys are lighting up cigarettes. the three come around a corner at a steady, deliberate pace. the men see them coming and leave.
scene change: cut to the bronze. a cockroach is being chased along the floor.
boy: get it! go get it, right there!
girl: i got it!
scene direction: she holds the roach up to the bartender and drops it into his jar.
girl: free drink, please.
scene direction: the bartender nods his head and goes to get the drink.
willow: ah, the fumigation party.
scene change: cut to buffy and willow sitting at a table.
buffy: hmm?
willow: it's an annual tradition. the closing of the bronze for a few days to nuke the cockroaches?
scene direction: buffy not paying attention
buffy: oh.
willow: it's a lot of fun... what's it like where *you* are?
scene direction: buffy looks up and smiles
buffy: i'm... sorry, i was just... thinking about things...
willow: so, we're talking about a guy?
buffy: not exactly a guy. for us to have a conversation about a guy, there'd have to be a guy for us to have a conversation about. is that a sentence?
scene direction: willow smiles
willow: you lack a guy.
buffy: i do. which is fine with me, most of the time, but...
willow: what about angel?
buffy: angel? i can just see him in a relationship. 'hi, honey, you're in grave danger. i'll see you next month.' willow: he's not around much, it's true.
scene direction: buffy looks dreamy
buffy: when he is around... it's like the lights dim everywhere else. you know how it's like that with some guys?
willow: oh, yeah!
scene direction: willow looks over at xander
scene direction: xander is on the dance floor, making a fool of himself. he dances up to a girl.
xander: hey, annie!
scene direction: xander sees her boyfriend
xander: dino, just leaving!
scene direction: he backs away and bumps into cordelia.
cordelia: ouch! please get your extreme oafishness off my two-hundred- dollar shoes!
xander: i'm sorry, i was just...
cordelia: ...getting off the dance floor before annie vega's boyfriend squashes you like a bug?
xander: oh, so you noticed.
cordelia: uh-huh.
xander: yeah, thanks for being so understanding.
cordelia: sure.
xander: y'know, hey, i don't know what everyone's talking about. that outfit doesn't make you look like a hooker!
scene direction: xander laughs
scene direction: he leaves the dance floor and goes over to buffy and willow.
xander: boy, that cordelia is a regular breath of vile air. what are you vixens up to?
willow: just sitting here, watching our barren lives pass us by.
scene direction: willow sees a roach
willow: oh, look, a cockroach.
scene direction: willow stomps it
scene direction: buffy lifts her eyes to see and then turns them back down.
xander: whoa, well, let's stop this crazy whirligig of fun! i'm dizzy!
buffy: alright, now i'm infecting those nearest and dear to me. i'm gonna call it a night.
scene direction: buffy gets up
willow: oh, don't go!
xander: uh, yeah! it's early! we could, um, dance!
buffy: rain check? good night.
scene direction: buffy leaves
scene direction: xander lets out a breath. willow holds her shoe up to him.
willow: want a free drink?
scene direction: buffy makes her way out of the bronze looking bummed. she passes the stairs. angel is watching her go. buffy senses something and turns to look. angel is gone. she continues out.
scene change: cut to the street. buffy is walking home. she senses something and stops to look behind her. nothing. she continues and walks past an alley. she hears a breath and stops.
buffy: it's late, i'm tired, and i don't wanna play games. show yourself.
scene direction: one of the three roars and drops down to the sidewalk behind her. she reaches into her coat, pulls out a stake and quickly spins around to stake the vampire. another of the three grabs her arm as she swings.
buffy: wuh!
scene direction: the third member comes up on her other side and grabs her other arm.
buffy: ooo! okay, okay, nice...
scene direction: they pull her into the alley and up against a fence. the first one approaches her.
buffy: okay, okay... look, i really don't want to have to fight all three of you... unless i have to.
scene direction: she snap kicks him in the crotch, elbows the third, and tries to punch the second. he blocks her swing and thrusts his knee in to her gut, slamming her into the fence. the other two recover and grab her again. the second one slowly approaches her with death in his eyes. buffy is terrified and struggles to get away.
scene direction: opening credits roll. buffy's theme plays.
scene change: *** part 1 ***
scene direction: in the alley. the vampire comes up to buffy, grabs her head and moves in to bite. angel comes up behind him, grabs him by the hair and pulls him off of her.
angel: good dogs don't...
scene direction: angel punches the vampire
angel: ...*bite*!
scene direction: buffy is surprised, but quickly regains her head. using the support of the two vampires holding onto her arms, she kicks up with both feet and hits them both in the face with a straddle kick. one of them grabs her again and holds her against the fence. angel continues to fight the other two, punching one and snap kicking the second. one of them pulls a piece of iron bar off of a window.
buffy: look out!
scene direction: angel turns around, only to be sliced in the chest with the bar. buffy shoves an open palm into her assailant's chin, pushing him off of her, punches him once in the gut and then slams both fists into his head.
scene direction: angel is bent over in pain and is about to be stabbed again. buffy quickly side kicks his attacker in the face, and he falls back away from angel. she helps angel up.
buffy: run!
scene direction: they come running out of the alley. the three get up and give chase.
scene direction: buffy and angel jump over the bushes in front of her house and run onto the porch. the three are hot on their trail. buffy gets the front door open.
buffy: get in! c'mon!
scene direction: she rushes inside. angel is right behind her. buffy slams the door on one of the vampire's hands. he struggles a moment, but pulls his hand back out. she slams the door shut and locks it. the vampire looks in through the glass. another one looks in through the window.
angel: it's alright. a vampire can't come in unless it's invited.
buffy: i've heard that before, but i've never put it to the test.
scene direction: buffy leans on the door, sees his wound
buffy: oh... i'll go get some bandages, just... take your jacket and your shirt off.
scene direction: she heads into the kitchen. angel looks out the window one last time and follows her. he takes off his jacket and his t-shirt. buffy looks at him from behind and sees his tattoo. she brings over the first aid kit.
buffy: nice tattoo.
scene direction: buffy exhales
buffy: i was lucky you came along.
scene direction: buffy looks up at him
buffy: how did you happen to come along?
scene direction: buffy begins to bandage him
angel: i live nearby. i was just out walking.
buffy: so, you weren't following me? i just had this feeling you were.
scene direction: angel smiles
angel: why would i do that?
buffy: you tell me. you're the mystery guy that appears out of nowhere. i'm not saying i'm not happy about it tonight, but... if you are hanging around i'd like to know why.
scene direction: buffy finishes bandaging
angel: maybe i like you.
buffy: maybe...
scene direction: they smile at each other. buffy hears the door open and quickly goes to intercept her mom. she's also worried about the three outside. she pulls her mom into the house and closes the door.
joyce: hi! what are you doing?
buffy: there's a lot of weird people outside at night...
scene direction: joyce starts toward the kitchen. buffy comes after her.
buffy: ...i just feel better with you safe and sound inside. you must be beat.
joyce: i am. we're a little gallery. you have no idea how much...
buffy: well, then why don't you go upstairs and get into bed, and i can bring you some hot tea?
joyce: that's sweet!
scene direction: joyce suspicious
joyce: what'd you do?
buffy: can't a daughter just be concerned about her mother?
scene direction: angel comes into the living room behind buffy. joyce sees him.
joyce: hi.
angel: hi.
buffy: oh! okay... um... angel, uh, this is my mom. mom, this is angel. uh, we ran into each other on the way home.
angel: nice to meet you.
joyce: what do you do, angel?
buffy: he's a student.
scene direction: buffy her mother gives her a disbelieving look
buffy: uh, first year community college. angel's been helping me with my history, you know i've been toiling there.
joyce: it's a little late for tutoring. i'm gonna go to bed, and, uh, buffy?
scene direction: joyce starts up the stairs
buffy: i'll say good night and do the same!
scene direction: joyce looks back down at her daughter and nods.
scene direction: joyce to angel
joyce: it was nice to meet you.
scene change: cut to buffy at the front door holding it open.
buffy: good night! we'll hook up soon and do that study thing!
scene direction: she closes the door. angel is still there behind it. they go up the stairs and into her room. she closes the door quietly.
angel: look, i don't wanna get you in any more trouble...
buffy: and i don't wanna get you dead. they could still be out there.
scene direction: buffy moves to the center of the room
buffy: so, uh, oh... two of us, one bed. that doesn't work.
scene direction: buffy faces him
buffy: um, why don't you take the bed? y'know, you're wounded...
angel: i'll take the floor.
buffy: uh, no, that's not...
angel: oh, believe me, i've had worse.
buffy: okay. um, then why don't you check and see if the fang gang is still loitering and, um, keep your back turned while i change?
scene direction: angel goes over to the window to have a look. buffy goes to her closet and changes.
angel: i don't see them.
buffy: y'know, i'm the chosen one, it's my job to fight guys like that. what's your excuse?
angel: uh, somebody has to.
buffy: well, what does your family think of your career choice?
angel: they're dead.
scene direction: she has finished changing and comes over to him.
buffy: was it vampires?
scene direction: angel faces her
angel: i-it was.
buffy: i'm sorry.
angel: it was a long while ago.
buffy: so, this is a vengeance gig for you.
scene direction: angel pauses
angel: y-you even look pretty when you go to sleep.
buffy: well, when i wake up it's an entirely different story.
scene direction: they go over to her bed. she hands him the comforter from it.
buffy: here. sleep tight.
scene direction: he lays the comforter down on the floor next to her bed. she gets into her bed and he lies on the comforter.
buffy: angel?
angel: hmm?
buffy: do you snore?
angel: i don't know. it's been a long time since anybody's been in a position to let me know.
scene direction: he turns his head to look at her. she smiles and settles in to sleep.
scene change: cut to the library the next day.
xander: he spent the night? in your room? in your bed?
buffy: not *in* my bed, *by* my bed.
willow: that is so romantic! did you, uh... i mean, did he, uh...
scene direction: buffy smiling
buffy: perfect gentleman.
scene direction: the girls exchange smiles.
xander: buffy, c'mon, wake up and smell the seduction. it's the oldest trick in the book.
buffy: what? saving my life? getting slashed in the ribs?
xander: duh! i mean, guys'll do anything to impress a girl. i-i once drank an entire gallon of gatorade without taking a breath.
scene direction: xander smiles
willow: it was pretty impressive. although later there was an ick factor.
scene direction: giles coming to the table
giles: can we steer this riveting conversation back to the events that happened earlier in the evening?
scene direction: giles buffy sits down
giles: you left the bronze and were set upon by three unusually virile vampires.
scene direction: giles puts a book in front of her
giles: did they look like this?
buffy: yeah. what's with the uniforms?
giles: it seems you encountered the three. warrior vampires, very proud and very strong.
scene direction: willow to giles
willow: how is it you always know this stuff? you always know what's going on. i never know what's going on.
giles: well, you weren't here from midnight until six researching it.
willow: no, i was sleeping.
giles: uh, o-obviously you're hurting the master very much. he, he wouldn't send the, the three for just anyone. we must step up our training with weapons.
xander: buffy, you should stay at my house until these samurai guys are history.
scene direction: buffy turns to him
buffy: what?
xander: ah-ah-ah, don't worry about angel, willow can run to your house and tell him to get out of town fast.
giles: angel and buffy are, are not in any immediate jeopardy.
scene direction: eventually the master will send someone else, but in the meantime the three, having failed, will offer their own lives in penance.
scene change: cut to the master's lair.
vampire: we failed in our duty, and now our lives belong to you.
scene direction: he hands the master a spear. the master passes it to darla. she starts to walk around behind the three as the master goes over to collin.
master: pay attention, child. you are the anointed, and there is much you must learn.
scene direction: master crouches beside him
master: with power comes responsibility. true, they did fail, but also true, we who walk at night share a common bond. the taking of a life -- i'm not talking about humans, of course -- is a serious matter.
scene direction: one of the three raises his head in hope.
collin: so you would spare them?
master: hmm.
scene direction: master gets up
master: i am weary, and their deaths will bring me little joy.
scene direction: the master begins to walk away, and collin follows. darla watches them go and smiles. she lifts the spear and dispatches the first of the three. the master stops and turns to collin.
master: of course, sometimes a little is enough.
scene direction: he looks over at darla as she kills the next one and continues away.
scene change: cut to the school. cut to the library door. giles sets out a sign that reads 'library closed for filing. please come back tomorrow.' cut inside. buffy is checking out the weapons case.
buffy: cool! crossbow!
scene direction: buffy lifts it out, sees the bolts
buffy: huh. check out these babies.
scene direction: buffy takes out a bolt
buffy: hmm. goodbye stakes, hello flying fatality. what can i shoot?
giles: um, nothing. the crossbow comes later.
scene direction: he takes the crossbow from her and goes to put it back. buffy is disappointed.
giles: you must first become proficient with the basic tools of combat.
scene direction: giles buffy looks bored
giles: and let's begin...
scene direction: giles comes back with two poles
giles: ...with the quarterstaff. which, incidentally, will, uh, require countless hours of vigorous training.
scene direction: giles hands her one
giles: i speak from experience.
buffy: giles, 20th century? i'm not gonna be fighting friar tuck.
giles: you never know with whom or what you'll be fighting.
scene direction: giles puts on his head pads
giles: and these traditions have been handed down through the ages.
scene direction: giles grabs his staff
giles: now, you show me good, steady progress with the quarterstaff, and in due course we'll discuss the crossbow. put on your pads.
scene direction: buffy laughs
buffy: i'm not gonna need pads to fight you.
giles: well, we'll see about that. en garde!
scene direction: he makes several thrusts and she parries them all. she takes the offensive, pushes his staff to the floor and punches him in the face.
scene direction: she comes around with the staff into his back, and again to knock his legs out from under him. he falls onto his back. she stands over him.
scene direction: giles stunned
giles: good. let's move on to the crossbow.
scene change: cut to the summers house at night. cut to buffy coming into her room.
scene direction: she closes the door and looks around.
buffy: angel?
angel: hey.
scene direction: she turns on her desk lamp.
buffy: brought you some dinner. it's a little plateless, sorry.
scene direction: she hands him a plastic bag full of food that she pilfered from dinner.
scene direction: he accepts it and looks at it.
buffy: so! what'd you do all day?
angel: uh, i read a little.
scene direction: buffy looks over to her diary. it's out of place.
angel: and just thought about a lot of things. buffy, i...
buffy: my diary? you read my diary?
scene direction: buffy goes to put it in a drawer
buffy: that is *not* okay! a diary is like a person's most private place!
scene direction: buffy comes back to him
buffy: i... you don't even know what i was writing about! 'hunk' can mean a lot of things, bad things. and, and when it says that your eyes are 'penetrating', i meant to write 'bulging'.
angel: buffy...
buffy: and 'a' doesn't even stand for 'angel' for that matter, it stands for... 'achmed', a charming foreign exchange student, so that whole fantasy part has nothing to even do with you at all...
angel: your mother moved your diary when she came in to straighten up. i watched from the closet. i didn't read it, i swear.
scene direction: she just looks at him.
buffy: oh!
scene direction: buffy looks down, realizing what she just said
buffy: oh.
angel: i did a lot of thinking today. i really can't be around you.
scene direction: angel buffy looks up
angel: because when i am...
scene direction: buffy looks down
buffy: hey, no big. water... over the bridge, under the bridge...
angel: when i am all i can ever think about is how badly i want to kiss you.
buffy: ...over the dam...
scene direction: buffy looks up at him
buffy: kiss me?
angel: i'm older than you, and this can't ever... i better go.
buffy: h-how much older?
angel: i should...
scene direction: buffy approaches him
buffy: ...go... you said...
scene direction: they kiss. they kiss again. they kiss passionately. she puts her arm around him. the kiss goes on for several moments. angel suddenly pulls back and looks away.
buffy: what? what is it? what's wrong?
scene direction: he turns to face her and growls. she sees he has his game face on and screams. he takes a last look at her and jumps out of the window. he slides down the roof and off onto the ground. buffy goes to the window and watches him run away. her mother comes running into the room.
joyce: buffy, what happened?
scene direction: she backs away from the window. her mom takes her by the shoulders. she looks at her mom and shakes her head.
buffy: uh, nothing. i saw a shadow.
scene direction: they both look out the window.
scene change: *** part 2 ***
scene direction: the next morning at sunnydale high. the team is walking up the steps from the street toward the building.
willow: angel's a vampire?
buffy: i can't believe this is happening. one minute we were kissing, and the next minute...
scene direction: buffy to giles
buffy: can a vampire ever be a good person? couldn't it happen?
giles: a vampire isn't a person at all.
scene direction: giles clears his throat
giles: it may have the movements, the, the memories, even the personality of the person that it took over, but i-it's still a demon at the core, there is no halfway.
willow: so that'd be a no, huh?
buffy: well, then what was he doing? why was he good to me? was it all some part of the master's plan? it doesn't make sense!
scene direction: they've reached a bench where willow and buffy sit.
xander: alright, uh...
scene direction: xander sits also
xander: ...you have a problem, and it's not a small one. let's take a breath and look at this calmly and objectively. angel's a vampire. you're a slayer. i think it's obvious what you have to do.
scene direction: xander smiles
scene direction: buffy doesn't react, so xander looks up at giles.
scene direction: giles crouches down
giles: uh, it is a slayer's duty...
xander: i-i know you have feelings for this guy, but it's not like you're in love with him, right?
scene direction: buffy looks away.
xander: you're in love with a vampire?! what, are you outta your mind?!
cordelia: what?!
scene direction: he looks at cordelia. she's looking somewhere else, but turns to him.
scene direction: xander to cordelia
xander: not vampire...
scene direction: xander to buffy
xander: how could you love an umpire? everyone hates 'em!
scene direction: cordelia looks back at another girl wearing the same dress she is.
cordelia: where did you get that dress?
scene direction: cordelia pursues her
cordelia: this is a one-of- a-kind todd oldham. do you know how much this dress cost? is this a knockoff?
scene direction: cordelia checks the label
cordelia: this is a knockoff, isn't it?! some cheesy knockoff! this is exactly what happens when you sign these free trade agreements!
scene direction: the two girls disappear into the building.
buffy: you think we have problems...
scene change: cut to the hall outside angel's apartment. he comes through the door and goes to his apartment door. he unlocks it and goes in. cut inside. there are a bunch of old books stacked along the wall. he closes the door and goes over to turn on a lamp. when he straightens back up he senses a presence.
angel: who's here?
darla: a friend.
scene direction: he quickly faces the voice. darla comes out of the shadows wearing a catholic schoolgirl uniform.
darla: hi. it's been a while.
angel: a lifetime.
darla: or two, but who's counting?
angel: what's with the catholic schoolgirl look? last time i saw you it was kimonos.
darla: and last time i saw you it wasn't high school girls.
scene direction: darla flares the skirt
darla: don't cha like?
scene direction: darla approaches angel
darla: remember budapest? turn of the century? you were such a bad boy during that earthquake.
angel: you did some damage yourself.
darla: is there anything better than a natural disaster?
scene direction: darla walks away
darla: the panic. the people lost in the streets. it's like picking fruit off the vine.
scene direction: darla reaches the bed
darla: nice! you're living above ground, like one of them. you and your new friend are attacking us, like one of them.
scene direction: darla walks to the window
darla: but guess what, precious? you're not one of them.
scene direction: she draws the window blinds open, letting in a stream of sunlight. angel is blinded, and he stumbles backward to get out of the light.
darla: are you?
angel: no. but i'm not exactly one of you either.
scene direction: darla walks to the fridge
darla: is that what you tell yourself these days?
scene direction: she opens the refrigerator and sees the bags and bottles of human blood.
darla: you're not exactly living off quiche.
scene direction: darla closes the fridge
darla: you and i both know what you hunger for.
scene direction: darla goes over to him
darla: what you need. hey, it's nothing to be ashamed of. it's who we are. it's what makes eternal life worth living.
scene direction: darla smiles and touches him
darla: mm. you can only suppress your real nature for so long. you can feel it brewing inside of you. i hope i'm around when it explodes.
angel: maybe you don't wanna be.
darla: i'm not afraid of you. i bet she is, though.
scene direction: darla starts to leave
darla: or maybe i'm underestimating her. talk to her. tell her about the curse. maybe she'll come around. and if she still doesn't trust you, you know where i'll be.
scene direction: she exits the apartment, leaving an angry angel behind.
scene change: cut to the library. buffy is looking through a book. so are willow and xander. giles comes up behind xander and startles him.
giles: here's something at last.
xander: can you please warn us before you do that?
giles: there's nothing about angel in the texts, but it suddenly occurred to me that it's been ages since i've read the diaries of any of the watchers before me.
scene direction: willow to buffy
willow: that musta been so embarrassing when you thought he had read your diary, but then it turned out he hadn't, but then he felt the same way...
scene direction: willow xander gives her a look
willow: i'm listening.
giles: there's mention some two hundred years ago in ireland of, of angelus, the one with the angelic face.
buffy: they got that right.
scene direction: xander clears his throat
xander: i'm not saying anything, i have nothing to say.
giles: does this, uh, angel have, um, a tattoo behind his right shoulder?
buffy: yeah, it's a, it's a bird or something.
xander: now i'm sayin' something. you saw him naked?
willow: so, angel's been around for a while.
giles: not long for a vampire. uh, two hundred and forty years or so.
buffy: huh! two hundred and forty. well, he said he was older.
scene direction: giles sits
giles: angelus leaves ireland, uh, wreaks havoc in, in europe for, uh, several decades, and then, um, about eighty years ago, the most curious thing happens. he, he comes to, uh, to america, um, shuns other vampires, and, and lives alone. there's, there's no, no record of him hunting here.
willow: so he *is* a good vampire! i mean, on a scale of one to ten, ten being someone who's killing and maiming every night, and one being someone who's... not.
giles: i say that there's no record, but, uh, vampires hunt and kill. it's, it's what they do.
xander: fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly.
buffy: he could've fed on me, he didn't.
xander: question: a hundred years or so before he came to our shores, what was he like then?
giles: uh, like all of them. uh, a vicious, violent animal.
scene change: cut to the master's lair.
darla: don't think i'm not grateful, you letting me kill the three.
master: how can my children learn if i do everything for them?
darla: but you've gotta let me take care of the slayer.
master: oh! you're giving me orders now!
scene direction: darla walks away
darla: okay, then, we'll just do nothing while she takes us out one by one.
master: do i sense a plan, darla?
scene direction: master she turns around
master: share...
scene direction: darla walks back
darla: angel kills her and comes back to the fold.
master: angel! he was the most vicious creature i ever met. i miss him.
darla: so do i.
scene direction: master considers
master: why would he kill her if he feels for her?
darla: to keep her from killing him.
master: hmm.
scene direction: master to collin
master: you see how we all work together for the common good? that's how a family is supposed to function!
scene change: cut to the school at night.
willow: okay, so let's review.
scene change: cut to the library. buffy and willow are studying.
willow: reconstruction began when?
scene direction: willow looks up
willow: buffy?
buffy: huh?
scene direction: buffy comes back to earth
buffy: oh! um, reconstruction... uh, reconstruction began after the... construction, which was... shoddy, so they had to reconstruct.
willow: after the destruction of the civil war.
buffy: right. civil war. during which angel was already, like, a hundred and change...
willow: are we gonna talk about boys, or are we gonna help you pass history?
scene direction: buffy looks up at willow. she closes the book.
willow: sometimes i have this fantasy that xander's just gonna grab me and kiss me right on the lips.
scene direction: willow huge smile
buffy: you want xander, you've gotta speak up, girl!
willow: no, no, no, no. no speaking up. that way leads to madness and sweaty palms.
scene direction: darla peeks out from behind the stacks.
willow: okay, so here's something i gotta know. when angel kissed you... i mean before he turned into... how was it?
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: unbelievable!
scene direction: darla continues to watch and listen.
willow: wow! and it is kinda novel how he'll stay young and handsome forever, although you'll still get wrinkly and die, and... oh, and what about the children?
scene direction: willow buffy looks at her
willow: i'll be quiet now.

xander: buff, it's not your fault.
buffy: no? i invited him into my home. even after i knew who he was, what he was, and i didn't do anything about it... 'cause i had feelings for him, because i cared about him.
willow: if you care about somebody you care about them. you can't change that by...

scene direction: buffy starts to leave
xander: uh, we'll keep an eye on your mom.

scene direction: buffy launches the bolt. it hits the wall next to him.
angel: little wide.
buffy: why?
scene direction: buffy gets up
buffy: why didn't you just attack me when you had the chance? was it a joke? to make me feel for you and then... i've killed a lot of vampires. i've never hated one before.
angel: feels good, doesn't it? feels simple.
buffy: i invited you into my home and then you attacked my family!
angel: why not? i killed mine. i killed their friends... and their friend's children... for a hundred years i offered ugly death to everyone i met, and i did it with a song in my heart.
buffy: what changed?
angel: fed on a girl about your age... beautiful... dumb as a post... but a favorite among her clan.
buffy: her clan?
angel: romany. gypsies. the elders conjured the perfect punishment for me. they restored my soul.
buffy: what, they were all out of boils and blinding torment?
angel: when you become a vampire the demon takes your body, but it doesn't get your soul. that's gone! no conscience, no remorse... it's an easy way to live. you have no idea what it's like to have done the things i've done... and to care. i haven't fed on a living human being since that day.
buffy: so you started with my mom?
angel: i didn't bite her.
buffy: then why didn't you say something?
angel: but i wanted to. i can walk like a man, but i'm not one. i wanted to kill you tonight.

scene change: cut to the bronze.
darla: do you know what the saddest thing in the world is?
buffy: bad hair on top of that outfit?
darla: to love someone who used to love you.
scene direction: buffy looks at angel
buffy: you guys were involved?
darla: for several generations.
buffy: well, you been around since columbus, you are bound to pile up a few ex's. you're older than him, right? just between us girls, you are looking a little worn around the eyes.
scene direction: darla smiles
darla: i made him. there was a time when we shared everything, wasn't there angelus? you had a chance to come home, to rule with me in the master's court for a thousand years, but you threw that away because of her. you love someone who hates us. you're sick. and you'll always be sick. and you'll always remember what it was like to watch her die.
scene direction: darla smiles
darla: you don't think i came alone, do you?
buffy: i know i didn't.

xander: did you just hear...
scene direction: they run to find a way in. cut inside. buffy reloads the crossbow.

scene direction: she caps off a few more rounds, and the pool table takes a few hits.
scene direction: buffy pops up with the crossbow and takes a shot at darla. she doubles over when it hits her in the abdomen. buffy watches as she straightens back up again.
darla: close, but no heart.
scene change: she grabs the bolt, pulls it out and tosses it aside. cut to giles, willow and xander crawling along the floor.
xander: we need to distract her, fast!
scene direction: willow calls out
willow: buffy, it wasn't angel who attacked your mom, it was darla!
scene direction: darla turns toward the voice and lets loose a hail of bullets as they hug the floor for cover. angel pulls the bolt from the wall. darla turns her attention back on buffy and hops up onto the pool table. buffy jumps up, grabs the edge of the table and pulls, knocking darla onto her back.
scene direction: she pushes the table away and starts to run for cover. darla fires off a few rounds as she rides the table across the floor. buffy leaps for cover over a glass case in a dive roll as bullets break it all around her. the pool table has stopped sliding, and darla gets up to look for buffy. she hops off of it and advances on the counter while shooting.
scene direction: giles gets up and messes with the lighting system controls. the strobes come on. darla looks up at him and stops shooting. buffy takes the opportunity to change position. darla sees her move and lets loose another volley.
darla: c'mon, buffy. take it like a man!
scene direction: angel comes up behind her, roars and plunges the bolt into her back. she is surprised and cries out in pain. she turns to look at her attacker.

scene direction: buffy is speechless and just watches him go.
scene change: cut to the master's lair. he screams as he wields a tall candleholder and smashes it in anger. he flails out with his arms and knocks other things over. finally he sinks to the ground in grief. collin comes over to him.
collin: forget her.
scene direction: master looks up
master: how dare you? she was my favorite. for four hundred years...
collin: she was weak. you don't need her. i'll bring you the slayer.
master: but to lose her to angel! he was to have sat at my right hand, come the day. and now...
collin: they're all against you. but soon you shall rise. and when you do...
scene direction: collin puts a hand on the master's shoulder
collin: ...we kill them all.
scene direction: the master smiles at him and gets up. collin takes his hand and leads him away.
scene change: cut to later at the bronze.
xander: ah, the post-fumigation party.
buffy: okay, so what's the difference between this and the pre- fumigation party?
xander: much hardier cockroaches.
willow: so, no word from angel?
buffy: nah. it's weird, though. in his way i feel like he's still watching me.
willow: well, in a way he sort of is. in the way of that he's right over there.
scene direction: buffy looks over where willow is looking and sees angel. she briefly looks back at willow and then heads over to him.

buffy: ...ever be anything. i know. for one thing, you're, like, two hundred and twenty-four years older than i am.
angel: i just gotta... i gotta walk away from this.
scene direction: buffy nods
buffy: i know. me, too.
scene direction: buffy whispers
buffy: one of us has to go here.
scene direction: angel whispers
angel: i know.
scene direction: they look at each other a moment longer and then close in to kiss. their kiss becomes passionate. buffy reaches her hands up to angel's neck.

scene change: cut to willow and xander.
xander: what's going on?
willow: nothin'...
xander: well, as long as they're not kissing.
scene change: willow just watches and says nothing. cut to angel and buffy.

scene direction: they separate.
buffy: you okay?
angel: it's just...
buffy: ...painful. i know. see you around?
