scene change: *** part 2 ***
scene direction: at the library. giles comes out of his office massaging his right shoulder, while xander walks in carrying a styrofoam cup.
xander: any word from buffy?
scene direction: giles sits down at the table
giles: not yet.
xander: here is your cup of coffee. brewed from the finest colombian lighter fluid.
scene direction: xander sits down across form giles
giles: thank you.
scene direction: giles takes a sip.
giles: horrible.
scene direction: giles takes another sip.
xander: aren't you supposed to be drinking tea anyway?
giles: tea is soothing. i wish to be tense.
xander: okay. but you are destroying a perfectly good cultural stereotype here.
scene direction: xander grins
scene direction: giles puts down his cup
giles: look through the, ah… kepler volumes.
scene direction: xander picks up a book.
giles: any reference to the demon olvukan.
scene direction: xander opens the book.
giles: powers, weaknesses, hat size, anything. there's got to be something.
xander: still batting zero?
scene direction: giles looks at xander.
xander: but i mean, ah… in cricket?
scene direction: cordelia walks into the library looking upset.
scene direction: xander looks up from flipping pages
xander: cordelia! what's up?
cordelia: i demand an explanation.
xander: for what?
cordelia: wesley.
xander: uh - inbreeding?
cordelia: so very funny. any minute i am sure to laugh. i just got off the phone with him. he could hardly speak he was so upset. he said there was something about a fight? and he is leaving the country.
giles: should i assay remorse?
cordelia: just tell me what's going on.
giles: buffy has quit the council. she'll not be working with wesley from now on.
scene direction: cordelia puzzled
cordelia: but he is her watcher.
giles: buffy no longer needs a watcher.
cordelia: well, does he have to leave the country? i mean, you got fired, and you still hang around like a big loser. why can't he?
xander: cordelia. we are trying to stop a massacre here. want to give us a hand?
scene direction: cordelia hesitates a moment then walks over to a chair taking off her jacket
cordelia: sure. - this is just *such* a buffy thing to do.
scene direction: cordelia sits down
cordelia: she is *always* thinking of herself.
scene change: cut to the mansion. angel is laying in bed. the arrow wound looks red and inflamed. he is twisting restlessly, clearly in pain, and moaning softly. willow dabs at his sweaty forehead with a wet rag. angel opens his eyes.
willow: you're awake.
scene direction: angel reaches for her hand
angel: you've been watching over me?
scene direction: willow nods. angel takes her hand and starts kissing it. he lays his other hand on willows right arm.
scene direction: willow taken aback and slightly worried
willow: well, - we've been taking turns.
angel: i thought… - i thought i'd never see you again
scene direction: willow looks at him surprised and confused.
scene direction: angel shakes his head
angel: i can't leave you. i was wrong. i need you.
scene direction: willow pulls her hand out of his
willow: oh!
scene direction: willow pats his hand
willow: you mean you need buffy!
scene direction: angel lifts his head squinting his eyes at her
angel: willow?
scene direction: willow relieved
willow: yes, - right!
scene direction: willow she points at herself smiling
willow: willow!
scene direction: angel trying to sit up
angel: where is she?
scene direction: willow pushes him back down worried
willow: she'll be back soon.
scene direction: angel sinks back and closes his eyes.
scene direction: willow gets up and walks out into the main room where oz is waiting for her.
oz: any change?
willow: he's delirious. he thought i was buffy.
oz: you too, huh?
willow: i hope she gets here soon. she better if…
scene direction: oz sighs
oz: yeah.
willow: i feel so… i feel so guilty.
oz: guilty?
willow: well, things are so terrible, and things are coming apart, - but in some ways, this is the best night of my life.
scene direction: oz blinks and reaches for her hand with a half smile
oz: us.
scene direction: willow smiles, nods and moves closer to him
willow: us.
scene direction: they kiss. the door opens, buffy walks in slowly, staring at the ground. willow and oz break apart guiltily.
willow: i just checked on him, just now. we're watching.
scene direction: buffy walks up to then, looking unhappy. the left corner of her bottom lip is busted.
oz: did you find faith?
scene direction: buffy just looks at them saying nothing.
willow: you didn't… she's not here?
scene direction: buffy shakes her head slightly
buffy: how is he?
oz: he comes in and out. i think the - pain is - less. now.
scene direction: buffy frowns slightly
buffy: would you guys… - i'd like to be alone with him.
scene direction: oz and willow look at each other.
scene direction: oz nods
oz: of course.
scene direction: as they walk past buffy willow turns to her
willow: we'll try to find another cure.
scene direction: buffy quietly as they leave the house
buffy: thanks.
scene change: cut to angel lying on his bed. buffy sits down and takes his hand.
angel: buffy.
scene direction: buffy lays her right hand against the side of his face
angel: is that you?
scene direction: buffy gives him a slight smile
buffy: it's me.
scene direction: angel tries to smile in return
angel: i didn't want to go, without seeing you.
scene direction: buffy puts a finger on his lips to stop him from talking.
buffy: angel, i can cure you.
angel: it's okay. - i'm ready.
buffy: angel listen to me.
scene direction: buffy takes a hold of his shoulders.
buffy: sit up.
scene direction: angel scoots up a little higher, but he is weak and moving clearly hurts a great deal.
buffy: you're gonna live. you have to live.
scene direction: angel frowns
angel: what way?
buffy: drink…
scene direction: angel frowns at her. buffy takes off her jacket, a determined expression on her face.
buffy: drink me.
scene direction: angel stares at her in shock, he shakes his head rejecting the idea.
angel: no.
buffy: it's the only way.
scene direction: angel keeps shaking his head and forces himself up out of the bed, pushing buffy aside.
angel: no. - get away.
scene direction: buffy takes a hold of his right arm as he stands up, looking up at him.
buffy: it'll save you.
scene direction: angel is looking down at the floor
angel: it'll kill you.
buffy: maybe not. -. not if you don't take it all.
scene direction: angel keeps shaking his head, still not looking at her
angel: you can't ask me to do that.
buffy: i won't let you die. i can't.
scene direction: angel still won't look at her.
buffy: angel the blood of a slayer is the only cure.
scene direction: angel finally glances at buffy
angel: faith…
scene direction: buffy swallows and answers quietly
buffy: i tired. - i killed her.
scene direction: angel shakes his head and lurches away from buffy
angel: then it's over.
scene direction: angel stumbles into the main room. he has trouble walking straight. bumps into the wall, then stumbles and catches himself on the sofa table, spilling a pewter pitcher and plate onto the floor. buffy grabs him by the arms and pulls him up to face her.
buffy: it is never over! i won't let you die. drink!
scene direction: angel glances up at her swaying in her grip
angel: please...
scene direction: buffy looks at him, then pulls back her right fist and hits his left temple. his head snaps around, but he stays on his feet. he turns back to look at buffy, and she hits him again. he still doesn't go down, but it takes him a little longer to come back up. buffy hits him a third time and this time angel spins back with a growl vamped out. he just stands there, staring at her, while buffy pulls down the shoulder strap of her shirt, then grabs him by the hair at the back of his head. she looks at him for a moment then firmly pulls his head down against her neck and holds him there. for a moment they remain like this. then we see a close-up of his yellow eye looking down, and he suddenly bites down. buffy gasps with the pain but holds still. angel is holding on to her now, and you get to hear all those sucking and drinking noises. close-up of his mouth on buffy's neck. some blood is running out beneath his lips and running down her shoulder. buffy's face scrunches up, she mouths what looks like 'oh lord' and slowly sinks backwards to the floor. with angel lying on top still drinking, buffy's left-hand reaches out and finds the pewter pitcher. she crushes it in her hand. the camera keeps jerking around the whole time, and buffy is clearly not enjoying the experience. she puts her hands against his sides as if she was going to push him off, but kicks out with her left leg instead, breaking the sofa table in half. she stares up into the camera a tear in the corner of her left eye. then her eyes drift shut and her head sinks to the side just as angel finally rolls off her, panting. his face morphs back to human and he pushes himself up looking over at buffy. the redness around the arrow wound is gone.
scene direction: angel worried
angel: buffy?
scene direction: buffy lies motionless eyes closed.
scene direction: angel bending over her
angel: buffy!
scene change: *** part 3 ***
scene direction: angel runs into the hospital carrying a limp buffy in his arms.
angel: i need some help! she lost a lot of blood.
nurse: what happened?
scene direction: angel runs into the er
angel: she needs blood.
nurse: try to stay calm. we're going to take care of her.
scene direction: angel lays buffy down on a bed
angel: something bit her. she needs a transfusion.
doctor: you found her?
angel: yes.
doctor: was she conscious?
angel: yes.
doctor: are you *sure*?
angel: i'm sure.
doctor: okay.
scene direction: doctor to the nurse
doctor: i need a type, i need cross-match. get her on two lines of wringer's lactate, and watch for hyper-bulimic shock.

angel: something bit her. i don't know what.
scene direction: doctor to nurse
doctor: okay. i need a rabies shot treatment.
scene direction: doctor to angel
doctor: any allergies?
angel: none.
scene direction: angel  rips the handle of the door without really noticing what he's doing. the doctor jumps back surprised. angel clearly upset and at the end of his patience
angel: just help her.
scene direction: doctor after a beat
doctor: you two been doing drugs?
scene direction: angel just looks at him.
doctor: you want her to live, you have to be straight with me.
angel: she's clean.
doctor: all right. wait outside. let us work.
angel: a phone.
doctor: right out there.
scene direction: with a last look at buffy laying on the bed angel leaves the room and goes over to a payphone digging some change out of his pocket. there is a police officer standing in the hall.
scene direction: while angel dials we hear a different doctor.
doctor: the bones are set, and the damage to the kidneys is repairable.
scene direction: camera pans through a nearby door to show a doctor talking to a distraught looking mayor.
doctor: but the head trauma, its… well its simply to severe. you know, it’s a wonder she's alive at all, with the blood loss. - i… i'm sorry sir, there is almost no chance at all that she is ever going to regain consciousness.
scene direction: camera pans over to show faith laying in a hospital bed. she looks badly bruised. she is wearing an oxygen tube, an iv, and several monitoring devices. you can hear a heart monitor beeping. the mayor reaches down and gently brushes her hair from her forehead and strokes her cheek.
mayor: it's your day.
scene direction: camera pans to show a nurse coming up to the doctor behind him.
nurse: we have another girl with severe blood loss. doctor pal wants you to prep this on an anti-cubal cut down.
doctor: i'll be right there.
scene direction: camera pans back to the mayor, who realizes just who that other girl must be. he leaves the room and walks over to buffy's bed. he puts his left hand over her mouth, also blocking her nose. buffy starts to move her head with a soft protest.
scene direction: a nurse comes in and tries to pull his hand away, but is unable to budge him.
nurse: oh, my god. sir! no!
scene direction: nurse turns and runs out of the room shouting
nurse: somebody call security!
scene direction: close up on buffy struggling harder. a pair of hands grab the mayor and push him away from the bed.
angel: don't do that!
scene direction: the mayor stumbles back, then gets right into angel's face
the mayor: i will. i do that and *worse*.
scene direction: the mayor looks over angel's shoulder at buffy
the mayor: murderous little fiend! did you see what she did to my faith?
angel: hadn't any plans to weep over that one.
scene direction: mayor seriously upset
mayor: well, i'd get set for some weeping if i were you. i'd get set for a *world* of pain! misery loves company, young man, and i'm looking to share that with you and your *whore*!
scene direction: angel's hands shoot forward and he throws him clear across the room. the mayor impacts with a window looking onto the corridor, breaking it, then drops to the floor overturning a small metal hospital table holding various implements. the noise brings two nurses to see what's going on. the mayor looks up at a mad angel and picks himself up laughing.
scene direction: mayor brushing off his suit and gesturing towards angel
mayor: looks like somebody has been eating his spinach.
scene direction: mayor looking over to the two nurses
mayor: no, it's okay, folks. it's all right. the show's not over, but there will be a short intermission.
scene direction: mayor looks back at angel
mayor: don't want to miss the second act.
scene direction: mayor walks by angel and out the door
mayor: all kinds of excitement!
scene direction: angel breathing deeply
angel: i'll be there.
scene direction: swallowing hard angel looks back at buffy laying still on the bed.
scene change: cut to the hallway. angel is crouched down next to the door to buffy's room, his back against the wall. the door at the end of the hallway opens. giles, willow, oz and xander come in. angel gets up.
giles: how is she?
angel: she's fine. she's asleep.
scene direction: oz with a puzzled frown
oz: well, you seem all right, too.
scene direction: angel looks down and wraps his arms around himself
angel: yeah.
scene direction: xander looks him up and down
xander: what happened?
willow: when we left her she was fine. did faith…
scene direction: angel interrupts her still not looking at any of them
angel: faith's out of the picture. buffy put her into a coma.
scene direction: xander takes a deep breath and stares at angel
xander: and?
scene direction: angel shaken and still not meeting their eyes
angel: buffy cured me. - made me…
scene direction: angel trails off.
giles: you fed off her.
scene direction: angel looks up at him, takes a deep breath and nods his head once
angel: yes.
scene direction: giles rather stern
giles: how much?
scene direction: xander swallows hard and looks away.
angel: she's gonna be fine.
willow: she won't be a vampire?
scene direction: angel looking down again
angel: no. - she didn't feed off me.
scene direction: xander shakes his head
xander: well, it's just good to know that when the chips are down and things look grim you'll feed off the girl who *loves* you to save your own *ass*!
scene direction: angel says nothing. willow and oz just look at him.
scene direction: giles curtly
giles: you better go, angel. we'll watch over her.
scene direction: angel shakes is head
angel: i don't want to…
scene direction: giles interrupts in a hard voice
giles: the sun will be up soon.
scene direction: angel hesitates, clearly reluctant to leave, glances up at giles. swallows hard and nods looking down, half looks towards buffy's room, then slowly walks away.
scene direction: xander shakes his head.
xander: gosh, i'm really going to miss him when he leaves town.
giles: let's go find out how buffy's doing.
scene direction: they walk out of the picture as angel leaves through the door at the end of the hallway.
scene change: cut to buffy walking through faith's apartment her arms crossed in front of her. there are cardboard boxes stacked everywhere. buffy stops and sees a cat jump up on faith's bed.
buffy: who's going to look after him?
faith: it's a she. and aren't these things supposed to take care of themselves?
scene direction: faith walks up behind buffy and stops next to her.
buffy: a higher power guiding us?
scene direction: faith looks at her then turns away and keeps walking towards the camera.
faith: i'm pretty sure that's not what i meant.
scene direction: buffy looking down
buffy: there's something i'm supposed to be doing.
faith: oh yeah. - miles to go - little ms. muffet counting down from 7-3-0.
scene direction: buffy grimaces
buffy: great. - riddles.
scene direction: faith standing in front of the broken window looking out
faith: sorry, it's my head. a lot of new stuff.
scene direction: buffy looks at her with a half smile. the cat on the bed turns for a split second into the image of a girl laying on the bed in white gown at the same time as faith still looking out the broken window.
girl: they are never going to fix this, are they?
scene direction: buffy concerned
buffy: what about you?
scene direction: faith turns around and gestures at her head
faith: scar tissue. it fades. it all fades.
scene direction: buffy looks down with a frown. for a split second faith's bloody knife appears in the palm of her hand.
scene direction: faith as buffy looks back up
faith: you want to know the deal? human weakness - never goes away. not even his.
scene direction: buffy with a half smile
buffy: is this your mind or mine?
scene direction: faith with a short laugh
faith: beats me.
scene direction: buffy gives a little laugh in return and looks down.
scene direction: faith walks towards buffy
faith: getting towards that time.
scene direction: buffy looks at all the boxes and the weapons laid out on the table beside her
buffy: how are you going to fit all this stuff?
faith: not gonna. it's yours.
buffy: i can't use all of this!
faith: just take what you need.
scene direction: faith reaches her right hand up to touch buffy's cheek
faith: you're ready?
scene direction: flash to white and to buffy waking up in the hospital. she gets out of bed and slowly walks over to where faith lies. she looks down at her then softly kisses her forehead.

buffy: so, am i crazy?
willow: well, 'crazy' is such a *strong* word.
scene direction: giles chewing on his glasses
giles: let's not rule it out though.
buffy: you don't think it can be done?
giles: i didn't say that. i might, - but not yet.
cordelia: i personally don't think it's impossible to come up with a crazier plan.
oz: we attack the mayor with humus.
cordelia: i stand corrected.
oz: just trying to keep things in perspective.
scene direction: cordelia sarcastic
cordelia: thank you. - my point however is, crazy or not, it's pretty much the only plan. - besides, it's buffy's, - and she's slay gal, - you know, ms little likes-to-fight. so...
scene direction: xander interrupts cordelia
xander: i think there was a 'yea' vote buried in there somewhere.
buffy: well, i'm going to need every single one of you on board. especially you xander. you're sort of the key figure here.
xander: key? - me?
scene direction: xander takes a deep breath
xander: okay, - pride, - humility, - and here is the mind-numbing fear.
scene direction: xander sighs

scene direction: buffy regretfully
buffy: rocket launcher not going to get it done. i mean, it took a volcano to kill one of these things last time.
scene direction: giles gets up and walks towards buffy
giles: um, buffy, all of this is rather depended on your being able to control the mayor.
buffy: faith told me to play on his human weakness.
willow: faith told you? was that before or after you put her into a coma?
buffy: after.
willow: oh.
giles: his weakness.
buffy: right.
giles: which is…?

giles: well, let's… let's…ah, let's think.
oz: well, angel, you hung with him the most. is there something that he's afraid of?
scene direction: buffy's looking down uncomfortably.
angel: well, he's not crazy about germs.
cordelia: of course, that's it. we attack him with germs!
buffy: great! we'll corner him, and then you can sneeze on him.
scene direction: cordelia gesturing excitedly
cordelia: no! no, we'll get a box with the ebola virus and… and…. or it doesn't even have to be real, we can just get a box that says ebola on it and… uhm

buffy: yea, it does. you and xander are going to have to work together now. can you guys handle that?
scene direction: neither one of them looks precisely overjoyed at the prospect.

scene direction: cordelia looks up at him
cordelia: needed?

mayor: well. what a day this is! - special day. today is our centennial the one hundreds anniversary of the founding of sunnydale, and i know what that means to all you kids: not - a darn thing. because today something much more important happens: today you all graduate from high school. today all the pain, all the work, all the excitement is finally over. and what's a hundred years of history compared to that? you know what kids?
buffy: oh my god. he's going to do the entire speech.
willow: man, just ascend already.
buffy: evil!
mayor: … for all of you it may be that there is a place in sunnydale's history, whether you like it or not. it's been a long road getting here. for you… for sunnydale. there has been achievement, joy, good times,… and there has been grief. there's been loss. some people who should be here today… aren't.
scene direction: close-up on buffy listening.
mayor: but we are. - journey's end. and what is a journey? is it just… distance traveled? time spent?

mayor: but i guess we'll just skip to the big finish!
scene direction: buffy and willow look at each other as the mayor starts to grimace and stretch and grow. his suit splits around him and snyder is leaning back in his seat looking taken aback. the mayor suddenly transforms into a big snake-like demon with clawed mandibles surrounding its mouth. it keeps growing, stretching higher as the faculty abandons their seats. the students get up but stay in place staring up at the mayor, who seems to stretch up above the roof of the school.
