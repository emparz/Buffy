adam: your thoughts are troubled. in turmoil. i understand, brother. we have a lot to discuss. speak.
riley: what have you done to me?
adam: nothing. it was mother, your...professor walsh. she implanted the behavior modifier.
riley: a chip in my head. she really did it.
adam: actually, the chip is here.
scene direction: adam points to his chest
adam: tied directly into your central nervous system through your thoracic nerve. this is phase one of your preparation. it lay dormant until the time came. i simply activated it, brother.
riley: stop calling me that. i'm not your brother. you're a botched science experiment. i'm a human being, who's gonna do everything in his power to-- adam: sit.
scene direction: riley sits down.
adam: you have no power. not yet. once you forget your old life and embrace your destiny as i have, you will know power you've never dreamed of. i think you're going to like it.

scene direction: fade into the crypt.
scene direction: adam is walking around.

scene direction: adam turns around
riley: not really wanting a lecture right now.
scene direction: adam continues walking.
adam: disappointed by demon-kind, we turned to humans. smart, adaptive,
scene direction: adam turns around
adam: but emotional and weak. blind. there's imperfection everywhere. something must be done. who will deliver us?
scene direction: riley says nothing.
adam: mother. she saw our future. yours and mine. she saw that you were necessary. she saw the role you will play by my side. stand up.
scene direction: riley stands up.
adam: you see, we are brothers after all.
scene change: cut to spike in the crypt.
spike: it warms the cockles of my non-beating heart seeing you lads together.
adam: i didn't send for you, spike.
spike: yeah, well...i'm not much the being-sent-for type.
scene direction: spike starts walking forward.
spike: i'm much more the "i did my part, now get this chip out of my head" kind of guy.
scene direction: spike looks at riley.
spike: slightly stiffer than usual.
scene direction: spike snaps his fingers in riley's face, who doesn't move a muscle.
spike: subtle, but i like it.
scene direction: spike starts nudging riley.
spike: what's with him?
adam: i activated his chip.
spike: oh, so, it's chips all around, is it? someone must've bought the party-pack.
adam: you get yours removed when the slayer is where i want her.
spike: she's separated from her friends.
scene direction: spike walks over to a chair.
spike: they want nothing to do with her.
scene direction: spike sits down.
spike: she's all alone.
scene direction: adam walks over to spike.
adam: that's how i want her. where i want her is down in the initiative.
scene direction: adam stops walking
adam: she will ensure that as many demons die as humans, she will achieve maximum carnage before she's too weak to go on.
riley: no. you can't...
adam: stop talking.
scene direction: riley stops.
scene direction: adam looks at spike.
spike: right. the initiative. but getting her there--that's what the bleeding disks are for, isn't it? our little witch gives her the info and pop--alice heads back down the rabbit hole.
adam: the witch.
spike: uh, willow.
scene direction: spike uses his hands to demonstrate height
spike: about so high, perky, good with math. natural choice.
adam: a friend.
spike: right.
adam: one of the friends from whom you so efficiently separated her.
spike: damn right i did. you should've seen her. they won't be talking to each other for a long, long...
scene direction: adam looks down at spike.
spike: hang on. i think i might've detected a small flaw.
adam: so you failed.
spike: well, hey, you're supposed to be so smart.
scene direction: spike stands up
spike: you let me plan this thing. okay, let's not quibble about who failed who. the important thing is make sure the slayer is where we want...
adam: go.
spike: gone.
scene direction: spike starts to leave. halfway out, he stops and turns to adam.
spike: so, uh, we'll do this chip thing when i get back.
scene direction: adam just looks at him.

scene direction: she lifts the covers.
anya: you can't go like that. they won't even interview you if you're naked.
xander: i'm not going. there's never anything good.
scene direction: anya sighs.
xander: maybe i should join the army.
anya: don't they make you get up really early in the morning?
xander: oh, yeah.
scene direction: xander pulls the covers over him.
xander: never mind.
scene direction: anya pulls the covers away from his face.
anya: are you still upset about that fight you had with your friends? it was hours ago! get over it.
xander: anya, you--forget it.
anya: so, they all think you're lost, directionless loser with no plans for his future? pfft.
xander: anya, you can't "pfft" that stuff away.
anya: why not?
xander: i don't know. 'cause i think maybe they're right.
scene direction: anya sighs and kneels down to xander's bed and lies on his chest.
anya: so what if they are? you're a good person, and a good boyfriend, and... and i'm in love with you. whatever they think of you, it shouldn't matter.
xander: yeah. yeah, it doesn't matter.

scene change: cut to the inside of a lab.
scene direction: a ball moves away to reveal a laboratory.
adam: this is where it all happens. where the new race begins.
riley: where are we?
adam: in the initiative. there are areas no one knew about beyond those that needed to. mother kept her secrets well.
scene direction: pan over to a zombie-type woman.
adam: didn't you?
scene direction: riley (o.s) professor walsh?
adam: this is all how she planned it, except she thought she would be alive.
scene direction: professor walsh walks over to a table with another doctor, who turns around. it's doctor engleman.
riley: are you-- adam looks at riley.
riley: is that what you were gonna do to me?
adam: they're just workers. you know your destiny is much greater. a zombie-man sits up.
riley: forrest? oh, god.

spike: looking for a little weekend getaway place. shove off.
scene direction: spike starts walking past buffy.
buffy: adam's been using these caves.
scene direction: spike stops walking.
spike: what?
buffy: i found his lair.
scene direction: spike sigh
spike: oh, cripes. that's all i need. runnin' into that goon.
buffy: yeah, well, adam's cleared out of here. whatever he's planning is about to go down.
spike: look at little nancy drew. what about those disks i nabbed? they ought to tell you something.
buffy: willow has the disks.
spike: well, then i'd get on that.
scene change: cut to buffy.
scene direction: spike o.s
spike: can't ignore valuable information cut to spike.
spike: just 'cause you two birds fell out, now can you?
buffy: right.
spike: well, you do what you want.
scene direction: he starts to leave.
spike: no worry of mine, now is it?
scene change: cut to willow's room.
scene direction: willow and tara are working on deciphering the disks.
tara: maybe you should rest. clear your head?
scene direction: willow sits down.
willow: can't.
scene change: cut to the screen.
willow: not now. i--i think i'm on to something. i've been assuming the--the ciphertext was encrypted with an asymmetric algorithm. then it hit me. a hexogonic key pattern. it's...
tara: hey, look, you did it.
scene direction: zoom into the screen.
scene direction: after a beat, cut back to the two.
willow: i didn't. i haven't even finished typing in the new code.
tara: something's doing it.
willow: must be programmed to self-decrypt to a certain point. that is so annoying. it's like someone blurting out the answer to a riddle just when you've--i mean yippee! we have the information.
tara: i'm not sure if "yippee" is the right response, either. read that.
scene direction: the phone rings. tara gets up to answer it.
tara: hello? yeah, she's right--i mean, let me check.
scene direction: she moves the phone to her shoulder.
tara: it's buffy.
scene change: cut to a close up of willow's face.

scene direction: forrest walks into view
forrest: reanimated with basic to moderate brain activity. mommy can hear you, but she's still a walking corpse.
scene direction: professor walsh pulls out a syringe.
riley: so are you.
forrest: no. got that wrong. i'm surging with life... and strength. adam made me to be nearly as bad as he is. really looking forward to trying out your girl again.
riley: i'm sorry, forrest.
forrest: don't be. this is the best thing that ever happened to me. i'm free of all my weaknesses...my doubts. he's gonna fix you up too, soon as we got some choice parts. then you and me will be back on the same side again. moving toward a new future.
riley: i'll never let that happen.
forrest: you don't get it brother, you don't have a choice. your will belongs to us now.
riley: no. that's not true.
forrest: then why don't you get out of that chair and walk out of here?
riley: you can't control my...
walsh: riley, be a good boy.
scene direction: she comes toward him with a syringe and puts it into his skin.
scene change: cut to the campus.
scene direction: many people are walking around.
scene direction: buffy walks up, meeting with the scooby gang.
scene direction: buffy to xander
buffy: where's anya?
xander: oddly, anya decided not to join us, despite all the fun we had at our last meeting.
willow: and i don't think tara felt welcome.
buffy: why? because of the things that we said?
scene direction: willow nods.
buffy: will, who told you we were talking behind your back, specifically?
willow: well, um...spike, specifically, but...
buffy: and who told you that we thought you'd be better off joining the army?
xander: that's not...exactly what he said.
giles: well, uh...s--s--spike can be very convincing when--when--when, uh...i'm very stupid.
buffy: he played us. he wanted us to fight to split us up. that's where it came from. the stuff we said the other night.
giles: of course. well, piffle, let's move on.
xander: i'm movin'.
willow: me, too.
buffy: good. great.
scene change: cut to willow.
scene change: cut to xander.
scene change: cut to giles.
scene change: cut to a shot of all four.
willow: so...why do you think spike made with the head games?
xander: he's all dressed up with no one to bite. he's gotta get his ya-yas somehow.
buffy: i think it was more than that. i think it was adam.
xander: spike's working for adam?! after all we've done--nah, i can't even act surprised.
scene direction: giles smiles.
buffy: i just went to adam's lair and he was gone. but, spike just happened to be there. he made this big noise about getting information off those encrypted disks.
willow: oh, i decrypted them.
scene direction: buffy looks at her, surprised.
willow: well, they decrypted themselves, but i almost had it.
giles: what did they say?
willow: a bunch of stuff we already know about 314. but it also said there's some final phase where adam manufactures a bunch of creepy cyber-demonoids like him. there's a special lab in the initiative, but it didn't say where.
buffy: adam fed spike those disks. it has to be. he wanted me to know about his evil-guy assembly line. this lab, it's in the initiative?
willow: hidden somewhere.
buffy: we'll give the demon his due. he thought this one out.
willow: what do you mean?
buffy: you know how overcrowded the containment cells have been at the initiative?
scene direction: willow nods.
buffy: those demons were just too easy to catch. it's like they wanted in that place.
scene direction: giles putting on his glasses
giles: the trojan horse.
buffy: adam's gonna make sure the demons attack the initiative from the inside.
xander: demons versus soldiers. massacre, massacre.
willow: and adam has a neat pile of body parts to start assembling his army. diabolical, yet..
scene direction: willow makes a face
willow: gross.
xander: does anybody else miss the mayor, i just wanna be a big snake?
buffy: i've got to shut him down, giles. his final phase is about to start.
giles: we need to warn the initiative.
buffy: they're not gonna listen to me.
willow: riley?
buffy: he's a deserter. he got some bad news anyway, and kinda took off.
xander: okay, i'm confused again. adam has this evil plan. why is he so anxious for you to know about it?
buffy: he wants me there. probably figures i'll even the kill ratio.
xander: he's not worried you might kill, oh say, him?
buffy: no, he's really not.
scene change: cut to the lower lab.
adam: she's coming. i can feel it.
spike: good on you. got a chunk of prognosticating demon in there, right?
scene direction: he walks over to a chair.
spike: now,
scene direction: spike claps his hands
spike: if you'll just get this chip out of my cranium..
scene direction: spike sits down
spike: i'll be out of your way. and mind the hairline. i don't fancy fussing over a comb-over as i resume my killing ways. come on, we had a deal.
adam: when she's here.
scene direction: spike sighs.
scene change: cut to riley.
scene change: cut to giles' apartment.
giles: certainly no lack of supplies. i only wish i knew which ones would kill adam.
buffy: according to riley, his power source is uranium core embedded somewhere inside his chest. probably near the spine.
xander: great, so we just ask him to lie down quietly while we do some exploratory surgery.
willow: what about magic? some kind of, i don't know...uranium extracting spell?
scene direction: everyone looks at her in disbelief.
willow: i know. i'm reaching.
scene direction: giles stands up.
giles: perhaps a paralyzing spell.
scene direction: he walks over to the bookshelf and pulls a book off.
giles: only i can't perform the incantation for this.
willow: right. don't you have to speak it in sumerian or something?
giles: i do speak sumerian. it's not that. only a...an experienced witch can incant it, and you'd have to be within striking distance of this object.
xander: see what you get for takin' french instead of sumerian?
buffy: what was i thinking?
xander: so no problem, all we need is to combine buffy--her with slayer strength, giles' multilingual know how, and willow's witchy power.
scene direction: giles looks at him.
xander: yeah, don't tell me. i'm just full of helpful suggestions.
giles: as a matter of fact, you are.
scene change: cut to an exterior shot of lowell house.
scene change: cut to the inside.
scene direction: the gang walks through the door.
willow: nervous?
xander: no way. i'm full of that good old kamikaze spirit.
giles: xander, just because this is never gonna work, there's no need to be negative.
willow: the adjoining spell, is it powerful enough to defeat adam?
giles: it's very powerful. it's also extraordinarily dangerous.
buffy: game faces, guys. we're going in.
scene direction: she kicks in the window.
scene change: dissolve to another area of the initiative.
scene direction: fade in to buffy and willow climbing.
buffy: how you doing?
willow: super. what was i thinkin', using stairs all this time?
buffy: okay. will-- willow: no, really, buffy. it's not as scary as i thought.
buffy: no. it's not what i was gonna say. i just...i'm sorry. i hate that things have been so strained between all of us.
willow: it's not your fault. spike stirred up trouble.
buffy: yeah, but i think trouble was stir-uppable. i think we've all sort of drifted apart this year, don't you?
willow: maybe a little. but, you know, first year of college, it's hard to keep the old high school gang together.
buffy: but i want it together. will, i miss you. and giles, and xander. and it is my fault. i've been wrapped up in my own stuff, i've been a bad friend.
willow: you're the slayer, buffy. your stuff is pretty crucial.
buffy: i mean riley. and...riley, mostly.
willow: well, i haven't been miss available either. i--i kept secrets. i hid things from everyone.
buffy: that's not your fault. will, you were going through something huge.
willow: i wanted to tell you, but i was so scared.
buffy: you can tell me anything. i love you. you're my best friend.
scene direction: they hug.
willow: me, too. i love you too.
scene direction: they begin falling due to the weight.
scene direction: willow o.s
willow: oh, falling now!
scene direction: they land on the ground, but continue to hug.
buffy: let's promise to never not talk again.
willow: i promise, i promise.
scene direction: xander slides down.
scene direction: buffy and willow hug him.
buffy: xander.
willow: oh, wonderful xander!
buffy: you know we love you, right?
willow: we totally do.
xander: oh god, we're gonna die, aren't we?
willow: no, we just missed you.
scene direction: xander looks up.
xander: giles, hurry up!
scene direction: giles looks down.
xander: you definitely wanna get down here for this!
scene change: cut to buffy and the gang.
scene direction: giles is inching the door open with a crowbar.
buffy: okay, we stick together, then everything should be fine. everybody ready?

scene direction: spike looks closer at the tv.
scene direction: adam o.s
adam: you've failed me again.
spike: well, that's one way of looking at it.
adam: what's the other way.
scene direction: spike bolts for the door, but forrest grabs his neck.
spike: oh, come on! it's not like i wasn't trying! that's worth something, isn't it?
adam: i suppose. yes. i will honor our agreement to remove your chip.
scene change: cut to forrest and spike.
scene change: cut to adam.
adam: take his head off.

scene direction: he holds up the device.
colonel: like...

colonel: what kind of freaks are you people?
scene direction: colonel puts the gourd down
buffy: adam is here, colonel. in the initiative.
colonel: nice try.
buffy: those overcrowded containment cells of yours -- courtesy of adam. he's pulling a trojan horse on you, he's just waiting...

willow: including the secret lab?
colonel: including everything!
scene direction: colonel takes a beat
colonel: what secret lab?
buffy: the one adam's been using. the one built for the final stage of the 314 project.
scene direction: the colonel has a blank look on his face.
buffy: and you have no idea what i'm talking about.
colonel: i know everything that goes on around here. a tick on a mouse couldn't get in without my knowing it. and if adam wants to try we're ready for him.
giles: jolly good. how--how exactly do you plan to get close enough to adam to remove his power source?
colonel: hit him simultaneously with multiple taser blasters. incapacitate him with as much voltage as we can muster.
xander: great plan. that's right up there with "duck and cover".
buffy: i've seen adam hit with taser blasts. he feeds on it. and now you're gonna provide him with an all-you-can-eat buffet?
colonel: you telling me my business?
buffy: this... is not your business. it's mine. you, the initiative, the boys at the pentagon--you're all in way over your heads. messing with primeval forces you have absolutely no comprehension of.
colonel: and you do?
buffy: i'm the slayer. you're playing on my turf.
colonel: up there, maybe. but down here, i'm the one who's in control.
