scene change: *** prologue ***
scene direction: night, in front of the cinema. marquee le banquet d'amelia.
scene direction: buffy and angel walk out amidst other moviegoers.
buffy: well.
angel: well.
buffy: that was very ... artistic.
angel: yeah.
buffy: wasn't what i expected. i've never actually seen... well, from the title i thought it was about food.
angel: well there was food.
buffy: right. the, the scene with the, the food. so, feel like getting some hot chocolate? or some cold shower?
angel: i'm sorry. i wanted to take you out somewhere fun. it's been a long time since i've been to the movies. they changed.
buffy: a little scary. and a little not, which is also scary. i'm sorry. i just, i don't like getting you worked up like that. we can't actually do any of those things. you'd lose your soul.
scene direction: besides, i don't even own a kimono.
angel: buffy, you don't have to worry about me.
buffy: just don't like to rub your nose in it. suddenly wondering where that expression comes from.
angel: look, i don't need to see movies to get worked up. just being around you does that just fine. doesn't mean that i'm gonna lose control, that i'm going to be frustrated around you. it feels nice, just to feel.
buffy: it doesn't drive you crazy, when we're close?
angel: watch this.
scene direction: angel long kiss
angel: see? safe as houses.
scene direction: angel more kisses
faith: check out the lust bunnies.
buffy: patrol?
scene direction: faith nods.
angel: council has you back on active duty?
faith: finally. they want us down by mercer.
buffy: okay.
scene direction: buffy to angel
buffy: goodnight.
angel: i'll see you soon.
faith: don't worry, big guy. just keeping her warm for you.
scene change: faith and buffy leave, arm in arm. cut to a cemetery. buffy and faith walk together.
faith: gotta tell you, b. the willpower thing, nice job.
buffy: thanks.
faith: but, the close but no cigar thing with angel. i don't know if i could handle, you know, the way you're not handling it.
buffy: faith, when it comes to angel, do me a favor. duck!
scene direction: faith ducks and buffy punches a demon behind her.
demon: ow! ooh! what are you, nuts? going around punching people?
scene direction: buffy pulls off its hat to reveal two horns growing out of its forehead.
buffy: people?
demon: so what, i'm a demon. that makes it okay?
scene direction: both slayers ready their stakes.
demon: hold it, whoa! stake me now, and you never find out what i got for ya, huh? think about it. demon seeks slayers, highly unusual?
faith: talk fast.
demon: how would you like to get your hands on the books of ascension?
buffy: never heard of 'em.
demon: books of ascension. very powerful works and i'm not talking about the prose. they deal with some, ah, dark stuff. and the mayor
scene direction: demon faith frowns
demon: would hate for somebody to get a hold before he, ah, well you know.
buffy: don't know. before he what?
demon: hey, hey, read 'em and weep. that's all i got to say. tomorrow, i get the books. meet me here and if the price is right, well i give the books to you.
buffy: not really looking to trade with a demon.
demon: and if this were still a barter economy, that would be a problem. i want cash, princess, five large for the whole set.
faith: so you can buy, i'm guessing here, some skin care products.
demon: plane ticket. out of the hellmouth before its adios, slayer loco. so, five g's, what do you say?
faith: i think "die fiend" sums it up, wouldn't you say.
scene direction: the demon jumps between them and runs away.
buffy: oh, let him go. i don't think he falls into the deadly threat to humanity category.
faith: a demon's a demon.
buffy: i'd like to know about these books of ascension. anything that would pin the mayor down would be great.
faith: yeah. it'd be great.
scene direction: opening credits.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: mayor's office. faith sits. the mayor paces.
mayor: and what exactly did this demon look like?
faith: demonic?
mayor: ah. and you say he has the books of ascension, or will soon, and he was, what, willing to sell them?
faith: that's what i said.
mayor: hmm. you know what i wish? i wish you'd pull your hair back. i know, i know, fashion's not exactly my thing, but, gosh darn it, you know, you've got such a nice face. i can't understand why you hide it.
faith: yeah, sure. whatever. it's just a matter of time before this demon guy is gonna spill. then buffy and the superfriends are gonna...
mayor: you know, you worry too much for a girl for your age. that's unnecessary stress. luckily, i've got just the thing.
scene direction: the mayor pours a glass of milk and hands it to faith.
mayor: there you go. now, first you load up on calcium. then find this demon, kill the heck out of him, and bring the books to me.
scene direction: faith looks at the milk and sets the glass down, untouched.
faith: and if buffy gets to him first?
mayor: oh, well. frankly i don't like to think about that. i like good, positive, up thoughts. if you fail me in that way. well, you know, replacing mr. trick was chore enough.
scene direction: mayor chuckles
mayor: oh, come on, don't worry. drink up. there's nothing uncool about healthy teeth and bones.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: in the library. buffy, xander, and willow sit at the table.
scene direction: wesley stands by it. giles stands in the door of his office.
wesley: and you say this demon wanted cash? that's very unusual.
giles: demons after money. whatever happened to the still beating heart of a virgin? no one has any standards anymore.
buffy: well, he said the books were worth the price.
xander: what's this ascension mean?
scene direction: wesley looks at giles.
giles: i'm not sure.
wesley: no, not really a common term in demonology.
willow: ooh ooh! the marenschadt text. i think in the section on genocide, they mention ascension.
buffy: well, we have a winner.
xander: and, more importantly, two losers.
giles: where did you find that volume?
willow: in the top of your book cabinet with the stuff you try to keep hidden.
scene direction: giles disappears into his office to get the book.
xander: hidden? are there any engravings i should know about?
scene direction: uh, frolicking nymphs of some kind?
willow: no. just magic secrets giles doesn't think i'm ready for.
scene direction: giles returns with the book.
giles: ah, yes, yes, here we are. there's a reference here to the journal of desmond kane, pastor of a town called sharpsville.
scene direction: "may 26, 1723. tomorrow is the ascension. god help us all." it was the last anyone heard.
wesley: of kane?
giles: of sharpsville. the town more or less disappeared.
buffy: so ascension possibly not a love-in.
giles: i think you should meet with this demon, buffy.
buffy: yeah? anybody got five thousand dollars?
scene direction: cordelia enters and approaches wesley.
cordelia: i have something important to ask you.
xander: important? let's start calculating those odds, people.
cordelia: what are you doing friday night?
wesley: uh, i, uh, as always my sacred duty as a watcher prevents me from, ah... why?
cordelia: i have a paper to write for english and you're english, so i thought ...
scene direction: cordelia sees the looks from buffy and xander
cordelia: what? is it so wrong to be getting an insider's perspective?
scene direction: cordelia to wesley
cordelia: i study best in a good restaurant, around eightish? think it over?
scene direction: wesley is speechless. cordelia exits.
xander: and on the day the words "flimsy excuse" were redefined, we stood in awe and watched.
wesley: right! books of ascension, mayor, slaughter. tell you what. why don't we try to find this demon sooner rather than later?
scene direction: perhaps persuade him to lend us the books free of charge.
buffy: i think faith might be useful in that persuasion part.
wesley: i imagine so. where is faith anyway?
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: the demon is frantically packing a suitcase. faith kicks open the door of the room.
demon: hey, slayer! you know, i wasn't expecting company. give me a minute and i'll have the place tidied up for you.
faith: you got the books?
demon: well, that depends. you got my money?
scene direction: faith slugs him.
demon: you're tough in negotiations and i respect that. check 'em out. now ah, that is quality merchandise. that's worth five grand easy.
faith: books of ascension.
demon: mm hmm. original editions and everything. uh, great condition. okay, it's a little worn on one spine, some slight foxing, but otherwise, perfect. now, the five grand, it's ah, you know, negotiable.
faith: i don't like to haggle.
scene direction: she pulls a knife and stabs the demon. he struggles, they roll on the floor, but she finally kills him. she stares at the blood on her hands.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: night, in angel's mansion. angel is reading. faith enters.
angel: faith.
faith: angel. i got nowhere else to go. look, i hate asking for help, but i'm asking, cause, uh, i'm in trouble. i'm in trouble. the real bad kind.
angel: it's okay.
faith: no, it's a couple of county lines over from okay, believe me.
angel: look, just talk. come on. start from the beginning.
faith: mind if i skip past the 'mom never loved me' part and get right to it? i'm scaring myself.
angel: i know the feeling.
faith: that's why i came to you. i don't want to get all twelve steppy, but remember when you told me that killing people would make me feel like some kind of god?
scene direction: faith shows him her bloody hands
faith: i think i just came down to earth. it's not human if that's what you're thinking. not that that makes me feel any better or this guy any less dead.
angel: faith, you need help. you can't do this alone.
faith: i know. for real now, i'm scared. scared of what i am, what i'm turning into. cold-blooded straight up killer. like you.
angel: not like me. i didn't have a choice. but you do. you can stop this.
faith: believe me, i don't want to end up the way everybody said i would, dead or alone or a loser.
angel: no, you don't have to.
faith: i don't know. maybe it's too late for me.
angel: it's not.
faith: angel, i'm so scared.
scene direction: faith hugs him
angel: it's alright, shh, it's okay.
scene direction: they hug for a moment, then as they part, they hesitate, almost kissing. angel pulls away.
angel: whoa. faith, i, look, i can be here for you. but not like that, alright? i'm with buffy.
faith: buffy, yeah. i didn't mean it like that. maybe i did, but i wouldn't press it. you love her, don't you.
angel: i love her.
faith: good for you. the two of you, you're lucky. friends?
angel: yeah, we're friends.
faith: then i'm lucky too. i'd better go.
angel: where?
faith: i need to cool down. spend some time alone. don't worry about me. you've been a big help. just knowing somebody cares. hey, i know i shouldn't be asking this, but do you think if things were different that things between you and me would be different, too?
angel: we'll never know.
faith: right. how could we?
angel: take care of yourself.
faith: lifetime of practice.
scene direction: faith kisses angel on the cheek, then leaves. buffy appears outside the mansion in time to see the kiss.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: night, in faith's new apartment.
faith: it's not like i wasn't trying, okay?
mayor: hey, there's no need to convince me. i'm sure you gave it your level best. i just don't understand what that boy could be thinking?
faith: try buffy summers, like in a big, fat, one track way.
mayor: hey, come on, don't be discouraged. you're a bright, young, energetic girl with a whole life ahead of her. and i won't tolerate brooding. so you couldn't give him that one moment of true happiness.
faith: i was thinking more along the lines of a long weekend, but okay.
mayor: and he spurns your advances. so be it. there's more than one way to skin a cat. and i happen to know that's factually true. we want to take angel's soul away. if we can't do it by giving him happiness, well, by golly, we'll just have to do it in the most painful way imaginable.
scene change: fade to commercial.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: in the library.
wesley: find anything?
giles: six course banquet of nothing with a scoop of sod-all as a palate closer.
wesley: i've had no better luck. there must be something about this accession somewhere.
giles: perhaps i should contact the council, maybe run a search...
wesley: no. i don't, uh, it should be i that ... the council isn't entirely aware that i'm letting you work for me
scene direction: wesley off giles's look
wesley: um, with me. i don't think they'd be very happy at the idea of the two of us collaborating.
giles: well i wasn't about to burst into glorious song about it myself. why don't you call?
scene direction: buffy enters, dispirited.
wesley: i think the most expedient plan would be to find these books of ascension themselves. buffy, you and faith must find this demon, and soon.
buffy: well, i'll go back to the scene, see if i can track him.
wesley: wait for faith.
buffy: that could be hours. the girl makes godot look punctual. i'll just go myself.
wesley: buffy, this is a job for the both of you. this demon could be anywhere.
scene direction: giles gives buffy a look of concern.
wesley: if these books are important as he says, he has good reason to hide.
scene direction: wesley xander enters
wesley: finding him is going to be extremely difficult.
xander: found your demon.
buffy: fashion tip, wes. mouth looks better closed.
xander: got the address.
scene direction: xander hands buffy a slip of paper
xander: i beat it out of willy the snitch personally.
buffy: you beat up willy?
xander: sure! well, actually, let's just say i applied some pressure. or more accurately, that i asked politely, and then, uh, okay, i bribed him.
buffy: how much?
xander: twenty-eight bucks.
scene direction: xander to giles
xander: does the council reimburse for that kind of stuff?
giles: did you get a receipt?
xander: damn.
buffy: i know this. it's down by the bus station. not the nicest part of town.
giles: again. see, no standards. i mean, any self-respecting demon should be living in a pit of filth or a nice crypt.
buffy: i'll remember to mention that.
scene direction: faith enters.
faith: mention what? where we going, girlfriend?
scene direction: buffy pulls her arm away from faith
buffy: actually, i can handle this one solo.
faith: why should you get to have all the fun? share, share, that's fair, right?
buffy: right. got our demon.
faith: oh, well, let's go look him up.
scene direction: buffy marches away and faith follows her.
xander: is it me or did it just get really cold in here?
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: buffy and faith enter the demon's room.
buffy: faith, careful.
faith: right.
buffy: missed you last night.
faith: yeah, i was patrolling. no shortage of scum you gotta watch in sunnydale, right?
buffy: so i've heard.
scene direction: faith reaches around a doorway for a light switch without looking.
scene direction: buffy notices but doesn't say anything. they see the body.
buffy: looks like somebody got here first.
faith: betting they got the books, too. some hit.
buffy: this wasn't just a hit. this was somebody's idea of a party.
faith: maybe the guy put up a fight. we gotta get going. come on, nothing we can do here now. you coming?
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: daylight. in the mayor's office. across from him sits a mage concealed behind bedouin robes. only his eyes and upper nose are visible. the eyes seem serpentine.
mayor: mint? didn't think so. well, scheduling a man of your talents is quite the chore, i'll tell you. between the chanting and the sacrifice, oh, my golf game is shot. but heeere you are. you know why i've summoned you. can you do it?
scene direction: mayor mage nods
mayor: need anything from me?
scene direction: mayor mage shakes his head
mage: you have risked great danger in calling on me. the deadliest magics are needed to rob this creature of its soul.
mayor: big job alright.
mage: and so it shall be done.
mayor: oh, that's just swell. listen, you sure you don't want any?
scene direction: cause they're, they're low calorie. okay.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: daylight. in a school lounge. buffy and willow sit together on a couch.
willow: are you okay? you seem a little on edge. is there anything that's wrong?
buffy: it's nothing.
scene direction: buffy willow looks
buffy: it's nothing.
scene direction: buffy willow looks
scene direction: alright, alright, stop with the third degree. it's faith.
willow: what about her?
buffy: i went to angel's last night and faith was there. they looked sort of intimate.
willow: no way. i know what you're thinking and no way!
buffy: you're right. faith would never do that.
willow: faith would totally do that. faith was built to do that.
scene direction: she's the do that girl.
buffy: comfort, remember comfort, here?
willow: i mean, please, does angel come up to faith's standards for a guy? let's see, is he breathing?
buffy: actually, no.
willow: but buffy, angel. there's no way he would ever do that. i mean, you're the only thing in the world to him.
buffy: sometimes i wonder. angel and faith have a lot in common.
scene direction: and there's so much he doesn't tell me.
willow: but it's so clear the way he feels about you. buffy, i too know the love of a taciturn man and you have to look at their actions.
buffy: i was.
willow: well, what did he say?
buffy: say? you mean when i straightforwardly asked him what was going on?
willow: so you bailed?
buffy: i couldn't. i mean, not ...
willow: enough. stop with the crazy. go talk to angel.
buffy: but i ...
willow: no. go. i give you leave to go.
scene direction: willow points her finger away
buffy: thank you.
scene direction: buffy leaves.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: night. in angel's mansion. faith enters.
angel: faith.
faith: hey. sorry to bust in uninvited.
angel: what do you want.
faith: look, i'm not so good at apologies. mostly because i think the world's out to screw me so i'm generally more owed than owing. but i've been thinking about last night and i want you to know i was really sorry.
angel: it's alright, faith.
faith: no, it's not alright. yeah, i was freaked and needed somebody, but you're with buffy. i should know better.
angel: yeah, okay.
scene direction: when faith gets within arm's reach, angel backs away.
faith: you don't trust me.
angel: it's not that.
faith: hey, no problem. join the club.
scene direction: she turns her back. he approaches her.
angel: look, faith. i know what you're going through, alright, and how hard it can be. it's important you have somebody who's been there and who understands what you're going through.
scene direction: angel he grasps faith by the shoulders and turns her around.
angel: look, i want to trust you.
faith: chump.
scene direction: she has a vial of blood in her hand and splashes it on his chest.
scene direction: out of the shadows steps the mage. his skin is blue and his eyes shine yellow. he starts chanting a spell.
angel: faith!
faith: i wanted to do this the old-fashioned way, but hey, your loss. lucky i've got some tricks buffy don't know yet.
angel: you don't have to do this.
faith: i know, but it's fun. now relax, it'll be over soon.
scene direction: the mage continues chanting. lights flow from his hand and congeal around angel's body. the lights fade and the mage disappears into the shadows. angel falls to the floor. he gets up and his face is vamped. angel and faith kiss.
scene change: fade to commercial.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: the kiss continues.
angel: thanks, so much.
scene direction: angel slaps faith away
angel: it's good to have the taste of a slayer back in my mouth. it's like cigarettes, you know, just when i thought i'd quit.
scene direction: angel kicks faith in the side
angel: no, don't get up. it's good to be back in sunnydale. nice climate, plenty to eat, no tortured humanity to hold me down.
scene direction: angel faith flips herself up.
angel: but you know what bothers me?
scene direction: angel angel grabs her by the neck
angel: you don't seem to be getting the big picture here, faith. now i don't know why you turned me, but i'm just glad you did.
scene direction: faith breaks free and kicks him away. she pulls out a stake.
faith: i've got my reasons.
angel: let me guess. you summoned back the true angelus because you need a new boy toy. doesn't work that way.
scene direction: they exchange blows. they stand, angel holding faith's stake arm up.
faith: you wanna be smart? you listen to me.
angel: funny thing about vampires, faith. we don't establish meaningful dialogue with slayers.
faith: not how buffy tells it.
scene direction: faith kicks him in the knee, driving him to the ground, and jumps astride him, threatening him with the stake.
scene direction: angel chuckles
angel: i should have known you'd like it on top.
faith: you want to listen or you want to die?
angel: as long as you're there, i mostly want you to wriggle. but i'm listening.
faith: last time you got like this, buffy kicked your ass all the way back to hell. you want to do better this time?
angel: still listening.
scene direction: angel his face shifts to human
faith: good boy. now all you got to do is play nice and call truce and i'll hook you up with the real power in this town. interested?
angel: very.
faith: then get ready to meet the new boss.
scene direction: they kiss.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: in the library. buffy, willow, oz, xander, and cordelia (really bored) sit at the table. wesley stands in front. giles stands in the background.
wesley: our enemy has us at a disadvantage. we seem to be consistently one step behind him. now he has the books of ascension. we must take definitive action.
cordelia: you have the greatest voice. have you ever thought about doing books on tape?
xander: way to focus cc.
wesley: yes, let's, uh, let's try to stay on track. we need everyone working together here. where's angel?
buffy: i don't know. i went to the mansion but he wasn't there.
wesley: and faith?
buffy: she's missing too.
willow: which means nothing. two unconnected events.
buffy: what should we do?
giles: buffy, i think you should try to retrieve the books of ascension. check out the mayor's office but be damned careful. do not confront the mayor. we don't know a thing about him.
buffy: i'll go home and stock up on weapons. slip into something a little more break-and-enterish.
giles: right. willow, how far did you get with the mayor's files?
cordelia: excuse me, i believe wesley is running this meeting.
wesley: it's, uh, it's quite alright. willow?
willow: it's all bad news. by the time i got through the encryptions, the files were empty. guess he saw me coming.
oz: what about the hall of records? go to the source.
wesley: good idea. there must be information on the mayor there.
giles: wesley, why don't you take the group and start looking?
wesley: right.
scene direction: cordelia pops up
cordelia: i'm in wesley's group.
giles: there is just the one group.
cordelia: yes! and i am in it.
xander: anyone mind if i skip the trip? i'm gonna cruise town, keep my ear to the ground, and i think five's a crowd.
cordelia: it really is.
oz: i'll drive.
scene direction: willow proud of oz
willow: they liked your plan.
giles: anyone finds anything, check in with me.
scene direction: giles to buffy
giles: be careful.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: in the mayor's office. the mayor sits behind his desk. faith and angel stand in front of it.
faith: so, can i keep him?
mayor: let's just take things step by step for the moment. now then, angelus, may i call you angel?
angel: well, actually, i'm thinking more along the lines of you calling me master.
scene direction: mayor unfazed
mayor: ah. you know, angelus, attitude may get you attention, but courtesy wins respect.
scene direction: mayor chuckles
mayor: i am the one responsible for your new attitude.
scene direction: angel picks up a letter opener, drags it across the desk surface. he starts prowling around the office.
angel: that's why i'm here.
mayor: no problems with the transition? no side effects?
angel: had a soul, now i'm free.
mayor: that's terrific! poetic too. not that i read much poetry except for those little ones in the reader's digest. you know, some of those are quite catchy.
scene direction: mayor chuckles
angel: hey, i don't mean to rush things here but are you trying to get to some kind of point?
mayor: kids today. rush rush rush. well the point, angel, is you're a very powerful young man, good for faith, and there just may be future for you in sunnydale. i see you're admiring my letter opener.
angel: well, actually, i was thinking of stabbing you through the heart with it.
scene direction: the mayor turns his chair to face angel and spreads his hands.
mayor: please do.
scene direction: angel throws the blade at the mayor's chest. the mayor brings his right hand in front of it and the blade embeds itself up to the handle though his palm.
mayor: nice shot.
scene direction: the mayor pulls the blade out of his hand and holds his palm up so they can see the wound heal itself in seconds.
mayor: you see, i'm what you might call impervious. can't be killed, or harmed in any way.
scene direction: mayor wipes the blade with a tissue
mayor: and that's just a cornerstone in my plans for this great town of ours.
angel: mmmm. can't be killed, but you don't like germs?
mayor: uck, eew, awful things, unsanitary. but my question is, now that faith has brought you back, what are your intentions?
angel: well, gee, sir, i thought i'd find that slayer that's given you so much trouble and torture, maim, and kill her.
mayor: fine! you know it's nice to see you're not one of those slacker types running around town today. torture buffy. killing her's fine, just make it a slow one.
angel: my favorite kind.
mayor: wonderful, wonderful. we don't want a replacement slayer anytime soon. they can't all turn out like my girl faith.
scene direction: mayor faith smiles
mayor: have fun.
faith: let's do it.
mayor: uh, try to have her home by eleven.
scene direction: angel and faith leave.
mayor: she's not a little girl anymore.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: night. xander is walking in a deserted street.
xander: i love when you talk, wesley. i love when you sing, wesley. can you say the words jailbait, wesley? limey bastard.
scene direction: xander sees angel and faith approach
xander: hey guys! man, where you been? you gotta find buffy. she's going to her place and stocking up on ...
scene direction: angel casually smacks xander in the jaw without breaking stride. xander falls limply to the ground. faith doesn't even look at him.
angel: that guy just bugs me.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: night. angel knocks on buffy's front door and joyce opens it.
joyce: faith. angel.
angel: hi, joyce, nice to see you. is buffy home?
joyce: upstairs. please tell me it's not some vampire thing.
angel: the only vampire here is me, joyce. say, you change your hair?
scene direction: joyce shrugs
joyce: highlights.
angel: nice.
scene change: cut to buffy's room. she's loading a bag with weapons. faith and angel enter.
faith: knock knock.
buffy: where have you guys been?
angel: been looking for you. good thing we found you before we left.
scene direction: angel kisses the top of buffy's head
faith: we got the books.
angel: they're at the mansion.
faith: we'd take 'em to giles ourselves, but i think strength in numbers is the way to go. come on.
scene direction: angel takes the weapons bag
angel: let me get those for you.
scene change: cut to the mansion. the trio enters.
buffy: okay, let's get the books someplace safe. where are they?
angel: actually, there's been a slight change in plan, buff.
buffy: buff? you just called ... what's the matter with you?
scene direction: faith stands back and watches the show with a little smile.
angel: nothing.
scene direction: angel his face has vamped
angel: matter of act, i haven't felt this good in a long time.
buffy: angel?
angel: you know, i never properly thanked you for sending me to hell.
buffy: no.
angel: yeah, and i'm just wondering where do i start? card? fruit basket? evisceration?
scene direction: angel grasps buffy's arms
buffy: no.
angel: yeah, i know what you're thinking. maybe there's still some good deep down inside of me that remembers and loves you. if only you could reach me. then again, we have reality.
scene direction: buffy breaks away from him.
buffy: i will kill you before i let you touch me. faith, we need to get out of here, now.
faith: speak for yourself, b. me, i like it here.
scene direction: angel growls and buffy turns to him. he knocks her out with a roundhouse blow.
angel: one thing i learned about buffy, she's so cute when she's sleeping.
scene change: fade to commercial.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: in the hall of records. wesley, cordelia, and willow sit at a table pouring over books.
cordelia: hey! i know a way to make investigating the mayor even more boring. on second thought, no, i don't.
scene direction: oz brings a book to the table with an old picture of the mayor.
oz: hey, whoa.
willow: whoa. big hey whoa. guys, check this out. wow, like father, like son.
scene direction: they compare a shiny new photo of the mayor with the old photo.
oz: how about like exact same guy, like exact same guy?
wesley: mayor wilkins is over one hundred years old. he's not human.
scene direction: xander enters.
xander: i, uh, hate to spoil the mood, but this is so much worse than you think.
willow: xander, what happened to you?
xander: you know how some people hate to say i told you so? not me. i told you so. angel's back in the really bad sense, and uh, i told you so.
wesley: angelus has turned? xander, this is terribly serious. are you sure?
xander: gee, let me think. kind of hard to tell. last thing i remember was his fist.
wesley: we must contact giles immediately.
xander: good thinking. let's waste time with a lively debate. leave buffy alone. see how dead she gets.
cordelia: slow down, xander. this isn't wesley's fault.
xander: actually, it is. faith was your responsibility. guess who's angel's new playmate?
willow: faith and angel? together?
xander: imagine the possibilities.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: in the mansion. angel (human face) is chaining buffy to the wall. faith watches.
angel: morning, sleepyhead. you know what i just can't believe? all of our time together and we never tried chains. well, can't dwell on the past, especially with the future we have ahead.
faith: bondage looks good on you, b. the outfit's all wrong, but, hey!
buffy: you don't know what you're doing.
faith: really? weird, because something about all this just feels so right. maybe it's one of those unhappy childhood things. see, when i was a kid i used to beg my mom for a dog. didn't matter what kind. i just wanted, you know, something to love.
scene direction: faith kisses angel
faith: a dog's all i wanted. well, that and toys.
scene direction: faith lifts a blanket to reveal torture instruments
faith: but mom was so busy, you know, enjoying the drinking and passing out parts of life, that i never really got what i wanted, until now.
buffy: faith, listen to me very closely. angel's a killer. when he's done with me, he'll turn on you.
angel: she's right. i probably will.
faith: yeah? hunh. guess we'll just have to keep you around for a while then. before we get started, i just want you to know, if you're a screamer, feel free.
buffy: why, faith? what's in it for you?
faith: what isn't? you know, i come to sunnydale. i'm the slayer. i do my job kicking ass better than anyone. what do i hear about everywhere i go? buffy. so i slay, i behave, i do the good little girl routine. and who's everybody thank? buffy.
buffy: it's not my fault.
faith: everybody always asks, why can't you be more like buffy? but did anyone ever ask if you could be more like me?
angel: i know i didn't.
faith: you get the watcher. you get the mom. you get the little scooby gang. what do i get? jack squat. this is supposed to be my town!
buffy: faith, listen to me!
faith: why? so you can impart some special buffy wisdom, that it? do you think you're better than me? do you? say it, you think you're better than me.
buffy: i am. always have been.
faith: um, maybe you didn't notice. angel's with me.
buffy: and how did you get him, faith? magic? cast some sort of spell? cause in the real world, angel would never touch you and we both know it.
scene direction: faith backhands buffy.
buffy: you had to tie me up to beat me. there's a word for people like you, faith. loser.
faith: uh huh. you're just trying to make me mad so i'll kill you.
scene direction: i'm too smart for that. stick around.
buffy: for what? your boss's lame ascension. like i couldn't stop it.
faith: you can't.
buffy: i will.
faith: keep dreaming. no one can stop the ascension. mayor's got it wired, b. he built this town for demons to feed on and come graduation day, he's getting paid. and i'll be sitting at his right hand. assuming he has hands after the transformation. i'm not too clear on that part. and all your little lame ass friends are going to be kibbles'n'bits. think about that when your boyfriends cutting into you.
buffy: i never knew you had so much rage in you.
faith: what can i say? i'm the world's best actor.
angel: second best.
scene direction: faith turns to angel in surprise.
buffy: graduation day. you think we missed anything?
angel: i think we know everything she knows.
buffy: may i say something?
scene direction: buffy pulls her hands free
buffy: psych!
faith: you played me. you played me!
scene direction: the scooby gang bursts in the front door. faith throws angel into the gang's path. faith and buffy fight. the gang wards off angelus with crosses and stakes. buffy and faith end in a standoff, each holding a knife to the other's throat.
faith: what are you gonna do, b, kill me? you become me. you're not ready for that, yet.
scene direction: faith grabs buffy's neck and kisses her on the forehead. faith runs away.
willow: are you okay?
scene direction: buffy looks at angel. angel avoids her gaze.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: in the library. the scooby gang and wesley. giles and the mage stand face to face.
mage: the task is finished.
giles: yes. thank you for coming to me and for that rather effective light show you put on.
mage: this restores the balance between us, rupert giles. my debt to you is now repaid in full. do not call upon me.
giles: i shan't. peace with you.
mage: and with you.
scene direction: the mage walks backward, fading into thin air.
willow: his debt to you is repaid? what did you do?
giles: i introduced him to his wife.
wesley: well, i for one protest. you pitted slayer against slayer in a dangerous charade that could've gotten them both killed, without informing me! i'm telling the council!
scene direction: wesley storms off
giles: i think you should.
scene direction: giles wesley stops
giles: we have a rogue slayer on our hands. i can't think of anything more dangerous.
buffy: at least now we know.
giles: and we know a little bit more about the ascension.
willow: graduation day. there's a big scary un-fun. at least angel's not bad, though. that's good, right?
xander: yes, i feel so much better knowing that he broke my face in a good way. it's a good bruise.
scene direction: buffy sad
buffy: he was only acting, xander. it was just an act.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: daylight. in faith's new apartment.
mayor: well, you win some, you lose some. from where i'm sitting, it's batting average that counts. so you lost some friends.
faith: i wouldn't exactly call them friends.
mayor: well, what are you worried about? chin up! you don't see me looking disappointed. heck, no. you know why? because i know you'll always have me, faith. i'm the best, the most important friend you'll ever have. besides, you know, once the ascension starts, the 'in' crowd you're so concerned about? whoo! they'll be lucky if there's enough left of them to fill a pothole. promise. still unhappy? okey-doke. i've got two words that are going to make all the pain go away. miniature golf.
scene direction: mayor grins
scene direction: faith shakes her head and breaks into a big smile.
scene change: *** scene change ***
scene direction: in angel's mansion. buffy enters.
angel: how you doing?
buffy: been better.
angel: not hard to believe. you were a real soldier last night, buffy.
buffy: that's me. one of the troops.
angel: i know how hard it was for you.
buffy: i really doubt that.
angel: is there anything i can do to make it better?
buffy: look, i know you only did what i asked. and we, we got what we wanted.
angel: i never wanted it to go that far.
buffy: i know that. it's not even a question of that. it's just, after ... i need a little bit of a break. please.
scene direction: buffy walks away
angel: you still my girl?
buffy: always.
scene direction: buffy leaves
