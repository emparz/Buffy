buffy: yeah, spike with harmony. if you can believe it. i couldn't figure out why he ran away but harmony said something. why they were here. they were looking for the gem of something... amara.
giles: the gem of amara. are you sure?
buffy: yeah, what's up?
buffy: uh, oh, it's just, uh, it's not real.
scene direction: he heads over to boxes where books are being stored.
giles: it's uh, the vampire equivalent of the holy grail. the source of some enormous power, was conveniently vague. oh, here it is, yes. there was a great deal of vampiric interest in locating it during the, uh, oh the 10th century. questing vampires combed the earth, but no one ever found anything... it was concluded that it never existed.
scene change: cut to buffy.
buffy: well, spike seems to think it exists. and he's looking in sunnydale.
giles: yes, well i'll research it as best i can. you've done all you can for tonight. why don't you go to bed.
buffy: uh, huh. sleepy. yawn. bye.

harmony: dorkus.
spike: bite your tongue.
harmony: do it for me.
scene change: steamy kissing. cut to xander and anya. she's still naked, he's still stunned.
anya: at point the matter is brought to a conclusion with both parties satisfied and able to move on with their separate lives and interests. to sum up, i think it's a workable plan.
xander: so, the crux of this plan is -
anya: sexual intercourse. i've said it like a dozen times.
xander: uh, huh. just working through a little hysterical deafness here.
anya: i think it's the secret to getting you out of my mind. putting you behind me. behind me figuratively. i'm thinking face to face for the actual event itself.
xander: ah, right. it's just we hardly know each other. i mean i like you. and you have a certain directness that i admire. but sexual interc-- what you're talking about, well--and i'm actually turning into a woman as i say this--but it's about expressing something. and accepting consequences.
anya: oh, i have condoms. some are black.
xander: that's... that's very considerate.
anya: i like you. you're funny, and you're nicely shaped. and frankly, it's ludicrous to have these interlocking bodies and not... interlock. please remove your clothing now.
xander: and the amazing thing... still more romantic than faith.
scene direction: anya moves towards him and they kiss. the buzzer for the dryer goes off.
anya: fabric softener.

parker: it's okay. you did a good thing for your friend. did uh, you and he used to go out.
scene direction: short burst of hysterical laughter from buffy. she stops abruptly.
buffy: um, no. no we really, really didn't.

buffy: what am i supposed to do? stand over here and watch?
scene direction: they dance, in a rather close intense way. lucky ones by bif naked plays in the background. - on the btvs soundtrack!
parker: well, i declared premed. but i hated it. so i switched to history.
buffy: history? fascinating dates and compelling faces.
parker: but there something amazing about these huge events that when you dig down into them they're just about regular people trying to make choices. when you look back at it seems like people were swept up in events they couldn't control. but i don't believe that. i believe you have a choice in everything you do.
scene direction: they kiss.
parker: is this okay? because i can stop if you wanna. it's your choice.
scene direction: parker pulls his close and strokes his face

harmony: but spike, you said you'd take me places. you said we'd go to france and now i can't even leave the lair.
scene direction: he throws down his shovel as the other vampires depart.
spike: listen to me, you stupid bint. this gem is everything i came back to sunnydale for, which has witnessed some truly spectacular kickings of my ass. now, when i have the gem, they'll all die, don't worry. but until then, stay inside. and by the way, i would be insanely happy if i heard bugger all, about sodding france.

scene direction: she goes back to playing with the jewels. he strides over and grabs a cross, burning his hand, crying out in pain.
harmony: you should put some butter on that. but, hey, maybe it's worth money, anyway. that would be something.

harmony: then we could go to france, i always wanted to go to france and stay in a chateau and you could take me shopping -

buffy: you had fun? was that all it was?
parker: what else was it supposed to be?
buffy: it seemed like you liked me.
parker: i do. but i'm starting to feel like you felt what? some kind of commitment? are you sure that's what you want right now?
buffy: i just thought...
parker: i'm sorry if you missed something. i thought things were pretty clear.
buffy: i'm sorry if i miss. i'm sorry.
parker: look, i really have to go now.
scene direction: he walks off leaving buffy looking dejected.
buffy: parker wait. i did this all wrong.
parker: no, it's cool. we'll hook up later.
spike: wow. that was pathetic.
scene direction: he punches her in the face.
scene change: *** scene transitions ***
scene direction: buffy is on the ground looking up, while spike stands above her in a beam of sunlight.
spike: birds singing, squirrels making lots of rotten little squirrels. sun beaming down in a nice, non-fatal way. it's very exciting, i can't wait to see if i freckle.
scene direction: buffy grabs her stake and jumps up. she lands a punch, then he punches her back and she hits the ground. he goes to jump on her and she kicks him back. he staggers, but jumps forward again, right into her stake.
spike: oh, do it again. it tickles. you know, in a good way.
scene direction: buffy withdraws the stake and he heals, while she looks somewhat surprised.
spike: the gem of amara.
scene direction: he holds up his hand, then backhands her whereupon she hits the ground again.
spike: official sponsor, of my killing you.
scene change: he vamps out then goes in for the kill. cut to the underground crypt. giles and oz are hefting willow up through the hole. harmony is crying.
harmony: being a vampire sucks.
scene change: she vamps out, then jumps up to attack with a fierce growl. cut to xander, knocking anxiously on buffy and willow's door.
xander: buffy.
scene direction: xander knocks again
xander: buffy.
scene direction: he turns away and runs into anya.
anya: xander. i was looking for you. you weren't in your musty basement.
xander: have you seen buffy.
anya: no. about what happened. i said i was over you -
xander: anya, i don't have time.
scene change: he cuts her off, then takes off running. she's left looking dejected. cut to the crypt.
giles: harmony, where's spike? has he had the gem.
scene direction: harmony nods.
harmony: he staked me, then he took it. he tried to take it right off my finger. like i wouldn't have just given it to him. i would have given him anything he wanted. he was my platinum baby and i loved him.
giles: where did spike go?
scene change: harmony, leaves, descending through the hole. cut to buffy and spike fighting. buffy is on her knees blocking a punch from spike. he redirects her into a pole, then kicks her in the stomach. she gets up and tries to kick him but he blocks her and throws her into the pole again. he's pressing her against it, then she grabs him by the throat and begins to choke him, then throws him off her. buffy kicks him in the stomach, which sends him spinning to the ground. he leaps back up and tries a spinning kick which she blocks, then kicks him with a roundhouse, then another, followed by redirecting him over a bench, sending him rolling. she jumps up on the bench and tries to kick him in the chest, but he blocks her, grabs her arm and throws her into a metal frame table, who's glass top shatters under her. she rolls off and spike strolls after her.
spike: getting tired slayer?
scene direction: buffy gets up, only to be hit with a series of punches and floored again. in the background, see xander running up.
buffy: xander, get out of here.
scene direction: spike grabs him, knees him in the face, and sends him flying into the pole from hell.
spike: so, you let parker take a poke, eh? didn't seem like you know each other that well. what did it take to pry apart the slayer's dimpled knees?
buffy: you're a pig spike.
scene direction: he jumps from the few stairs he was above her, then kicks her full on.
spike: did he play the sensitive lad and get you to seduce him? that's a good trick if the girls thick enough to buy it.
scene direction: buffy flies up and delivers a roundhouse, however spike follows it with an equally vicious hit that sends her flying forward.
spike: i wonder what went wrong. were you too strong? did you bruise the boy? come to think of it seems like someone told me that. who was it? oh, yeah. angel.
scene direction: he smiles cruelly, and buffy is up in an instant. she throws a round house, then a punch, then another and another. she redirects him over the edge of a planter, jumps on it and while coming down kicks him, sending him flying into another planter knocking over a earthenware pot. she grabs him, punching him twice in the face, then grabs the arm with the ring on it.
spike: take it off me this way, we both burn.
buffy: really? let's see.
scene change: she jerks the ring off his finger and his face instantly contorts into a visage of pain. he starts to smoke then runs off crying out in agony. buffy, exhausted sits down inspecting the ring. cut to a close up of the ring on a wooden table.
willow: i like it.
oz: it's small.
xander: really worth getting my ribs bashed in.
scene direction: the scooby gang is collected at giles apartment, gathered round the ring, which is set in the middle of his coffee table.
giles: it's also very dangerous. and we're destroying it.
buffy: we don't destroy it.
giles: well, buffy, any vampire that gets his hand on this is going to be essentially unlikable.
scene direction: giles looks at buffy for a moment
giles: oh.
oz: i have that gig in la. i could swing by.
buffy: thanks oz.
xander: what's going on. what's in la?
willow: she's giving the ring to angel. don't make a fuss.
giles: buffy are you sure.
buffy: he should have it.
scene change: cut to buffy and willow walking through the campus late at night.
buffy: so what i'm wondering is, does this always happen? sleep with a guy and he goes all evil. god, i'm such a fool.
willow: well maybe you made a mistake. but that's okay. next time - what?
buffy: parker said it's okay to make mistakes. it was sweet.
willow: no it wasn't. he was saying that so you would take a chance and sleep with him. he's a poop head.
buffy: you're right. he's manipulative and shallow. and why doesn't he want me. am i repulsive? if there was something repulsive about me you would tell me, right?
willow: i'm your friend. i would call you repulsive in a second.
buffy: maybe parker and i could still work it out. do you think we could still work it out?
willow: i think you're missing something about this whole poop head principal.
buffy: i think i'm gonna take a walk. you go on ahead.
willow: you sure?
buffy: yeah.
scene direction: she heads off leaving willow behind. she walks along alone, then see both anya and harmony, all looking downtrodden walking along.
scene direction: black out
