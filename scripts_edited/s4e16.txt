scene change: *** prologue ***
scene direction: fade in. night. exterior shot of the summers home. several police cars are out in front of the house, strobing the neighborhood with their red lights. an ambulance is parked on the lawn, it's rear doors open and facing the house. a few curious neighbors have also gathered. a plainclothes detective is talking to the young woman he thinks is buffy summers. they're standing close to the steps of the front porch. joyce summers is walking out of the house and drapes a coat around faith [buffy]'s shoulders.
detective: it's good you called. we've been looking for this girl since she broke out of the hospital.
joyce: what's going to happen to her?
detective: well, get her checked out. if she's in stable condition, she goes to jail, pending trial.
joyce: i just hope she gets some kind of help.
scene direction: behind them, the paramedics are wheeling a gurney out the front door.
scene direction: buffy [faith]'s body is strapped to it. she's barely conscious.
detective: the first thing is to keep her from hurting anybody else.
scene direction: as it's taken past joyce and faith [buffy], buffy[faith] looks at them with half-opened eyes. from her blurring pov she sees faith [buffy] take her mother's hand and lift it, casually, to make sure she sees this. then her vision fades as she loses consciousness. the paramedics load her into the ambulance.
detective: well, you guys will be safe now. we may have a couple of questions in the morning.
joyce: oh, uh, of course.
detective: thank you both. i'm glad we finally got the kid.
scene direction: faith [buffy] sharply
faith [buffy]: she's not a kid.
scene direction: faith [buffy] sees the detective's surprised look
faith [buffy]: i just mean that she's very strong.
detective: yeah. this faith chick-- definitely dangerous.
scene direction: with that, the detective turns and walks toward one of the squad cars.
scene direction: joyce heads back into the house, but faith [buffy] stands there watching the ambulance pull out of the drive way.
faith [buffy]: she truly is.
scene direction: faith [buffy] turns, in her new body, and starts walking back to the house.
scene direction: wolf's howl. buffy theme and credits roll.
scene change: *** act 1 ***
scene direction: fade in. interior of the summers home. the last of the police have left and joyce is closing the front door. faith [buffy] is casually walking into the living room stretching her arms.
scene direction: startled, faith [buffy] spins around to face her, slight panic on her face. joyce has a thoughtful expression.
joyce: why do you think she's like that?
scene direction: faith [buffy] shrugs
faith [buffy]: you know. she's a nut job. heh.
joyce: i just don't understand what could drive a person to that kind of behavior.
faith [buffy]: well, how do you know she got drove? i mean, maybe she likes being that way.
joyce: i'll never believe that. i think she's horribly unhappy.
faith [buffy]: well, could be things are looking up. i mean, a little stint in the pokey, show her the error of her ways.
scene direction: faith [buffy] grins
faith [buffy]: i'm sure there's some big old bertha just waiting to shower her ripe little self with affection.
scene direction: joyce shocked
joyce: buffy!
faith [buffy]: i'm sorry, mom.
scene direction: faith [buffy] sighs
faith [buffy]: it's just...
scene direction: faith [buffy] crosses the room to joyce
faith [buffy]:  ugh when i think about how she might have hurt you, i just... ugh i can't stand it.
scene direction: touched, joyce smiles and gives her a big hug. over her shoulder faith [buffy] grimaces in discomfort at this mushy affection. she pulls away and heads towards the stairs.
scene direction: joyce slightly hurt
joyce: sorry.
scene direction: faith [buffy] makes of show of stretching her shoulders
faith [buffy]: no, i'm just, uh, sore from the fight.
joyce: i've missed you.
faith [buffy]: 'cause i haven't visited, right?
scene direction: faith [buffy] smugly
faith [buffy]: i knew it.
joyce: i know how it is. you've . . . got so much in your life now.
faith [buffy]: i'm a busy little beaver. college and all.
scene direction: joyce nods
joyce: of course.
scene direction: joyce hopefully
joyce: but, um, maybe we could spend some time together soon? some night when i'm not being held hostage by a raving psychotic.
scene direction: faith [buffy] pauses
faith [buffy]: count on it.
scene direction: faith [buffy] smiles
faith [buffy]: i'm gonna take a bath.
scene direction: faith [buffy] turns abruptly and heads upstairs.
scene change: cut to faith [buffy] in the tub, having a bubble bath.
scene direction: faith [buffy] sighs with her eyes closed. then she raises her arms out of the water to examine them. she lifts her left leg straight up to look at it and smiles, caressing it with her hands. faith [buffy] lowers the leg back in the water and scoops two handfuls of suds and blows the bubbles into the air.
scene change: cut to faith [buffy] looking at buffy's reflection in the mirror, from the mirror's pov.
scene direction: faith [buffy]'s hair is hanging wet on her shoulders and she has a towel wrapped around herself. she turns her head to the right then to the left. she leans towards the mirror for a closer look and scrunches her face. she relaxes her features then uses her index fingers to push her eyebrows high on her forehead. next, she opens her mouth wide to stick her tongue out. again she uses her index fingers to raise her top lip, looking at buffy's very white teeth.
scene change: cut to a few frames later, still in front of the mirror.
scene direction: faith [buffy] speaking in a pleasant voice.
faith [buffy]: why, yes, i would be buffy. may i help you?
scene change: cut to a few frames later.
scene direction: faith [buffy] practicing
faith [buffy]: buf-fy.
scene change: cut to faith [buffy] sticking her tongue out again, head tilted to the side.
scene change: cut to faith [buffy] running her fingers through her wet hair, then puts forth an admonishing finger as if speaking to a child.
scene direction: faith [buffy] scolding
faith [buffy]: you can't do that! it's wrong.
scene direction: she shakes her head slightly.
scene direction: faith [buffy] sensitively
faith [buffy]: you can't do that, because it's naughty.
scene direction: faith [buffy] grimaces
scene direction: faith [buffy] sternly
faith [buffy]: because it's wrong.
scene direction: faith [buffy] empathetically
faith [buffy]: because it's wrong.
scene direction: faith [buffy] walks a few feet away from the mirror then suddenly whips around to face it, pointing at it with her hand in a gun shape.
faith [buffy]: you can't do that! it's wrong! i'll kick your ass!
scene direction: faith [buffy] still pointing at the mirror.
faith [buffy]: i'm gonna kill you!
scene direction: faith [buffy] leans closer to the mirror as a voice-over of evil laughter is heard.
scene change: cut to the hospital. a burly male nurse comes crashing across the room, hitting the counter, and falls to the floor. he just had his ass thrown.
buffy [faith]: let me go! let me go!
scene direction: camera pans and sees buffy [faith] thrashing in a bed trying to free herself from the men who are holding her down. the doctor hurries away from the bed as a police officer, the detective, and two orderlies restrain her. it's all they can do to keep her on the bed.
doctor: get me a sedative, now!
detective: hold her!
scene direction: buffy [faith] yelling
buffy [faith]: i have to go home! she's with my mother!
scene direction: the doctor returns and clamps a hand on buffy [faith]'s arm to still it and shoves a syringe needle into her vein.
buffy [faith]: no!
doctor: just lie still.
scene direction: buffy [faith] weakening voice
buffy [faith]: you don't understand.
detective: keep holding her.
scene direction: buffy [faith]'s struggles quickly lessen as the drug takes effect.
scene direction: buffy [faith] fading
buffy [faith]: she's taken myâ€¦ my body.
scene direction: unable to keep her eyes open her head falls back.
scene change: cut to tara's dimly lit room. willow is laying on the bed, hands folded across her stomach. tara is sitting on the other side of the bed reading tarot cards.
willow: i wonder where she is?
tara: who? faith?
willow: yeah. i wish she would make a move. she's making my stomach all acidy.
tara: but you think buffy can handle her?
scene direction: willow sits up to face her.
willow: i think so.
scene direction: willow worried
willow: but that doesn't mean faith won't hurt someone else.
tara: well, you should be safe. nobody knows you're here. i mean... they don't even know i exist, right? i know all about them, but...
scene direction: willow softly
willow: hey.
scene direction: willow puts a gentle hand on tara's knee. tara continues.
tara: i mean-i mean, th-that's totally cool. i mean, it-it's good. it's... it's better.
willow: tara, it's not like i don't want my friends to know you. it's just... well, buffy's like my best friend, and she's really special. and there's this whole bunch of us, and we sort of have this group thing that revolves around the slaying, and-and i, i really want you to meet them. but i kind of like having something that's just, you know, mine.
scene direction: tara regards her silently for a moment.
willow: and i-i usually don't use so many words to say stuff that little, but
scene direction: willow laughs softly
willow: do you get it at all?
tara: i do.
scene direction: willow takes a deep breath.
willow: i should check in with giles, get a situation update.
scene direction: willow gets up and rounds the bed to the other side of the room behind tara.
tara: i am, you know.
scene direction: willow stops to face tara.
willow: what?
scene direction: tara looks over her shoulder at willow.
scene direction: tara meaningfully
tara: yours.
scene direction: willow smiles at this.
scene change: cut to buffy's bedroom.
scene direction: faith [buffy] is standing in front of the full-length mirror checking out buffy's reflection. she's dressed in a long, sleek black tank top and black leather pants and boots. her hair is in wavy curls. reaching into the shirt, she adjusts buffy's breasts to a more perky position then puts her hands on her hips to inspect the improved cleavage.
faith [buffy]: not too bad.
scene direction: faith [buffy] turns to buffy's dresser and begins to search it. in the first drawer she opens she finds buffy's passport and flips through it.
faith: score.
scene direction: faith [buffy] is sitting on the bed, holding a credit card. and is on the phone.
faith [buffy]: 6-4-4-7.
scene direction: faith [buffy] pauses
faith [buffy]: uh, expiration, 5-0-1.
scene direction: faith [buffy] pauses and puts the card back in her purse.
faith [buffy]: unh huh.
scene direction: faith [buffy] pauses
faith [buffy]: yeah.
scene direction: faith [buffy] pauses and takes cash out of the purse.
faith [buffy]: 10 a.m.'s your earliest flight? i'll take it.
scene direction: joyce enters.
joyce: what are you doing?
faith [buffy]: oh, just getting my mail.
scene direction: faith [buffy] holds up the letters.
joyce: oh. um, that was, um, giles on the other line. he wanted you to meet your friends there. said he had news.
faith [buffy]: yeah. i got some time to kill.
scene direction: faith [buffy] gets up
faith [buffy]: i'll go see the gang. all my friends.
scene direction: faith [buffy] picks up a lipstick.
faith [buffy]: you don't mind if i steal this, right?
joyce: is that the harlot?
faith [buffy]: yeah.
joyce: that's the same one faith picked.
faith [buffy]: burn it.
scene direction: faith [buffy] tosses it to joyce who catches it.
scene change: cut to buffy [faith] in the back of a police car with a uniformed officer driving and a plainclothes office riding shotgun.
scene direction: buffy [faith] moans almost inaudibly.
policeman #1: she's coming to.
policeman #2: yeah.
policeman #1: man, i want this kid's constitution.
buffy [faith]: faith.
policeman #1: let's move it. i want to get her in before she's 100%.
scene direction: the uniformed policeman nods.
scene direction: a red armored car/truck cuts off the police car which crashes into it. two men in black clothing jump out of the back. one uses a gun to cover the two police officers, who seem to be stunned. another uses an ax to smash the back window. the one with the gun breaks remnants on the sides with the gun. the ax one drags buffy [faith] out the window.
weatherby: by order of the watcher's council, you are being taken into custody until such time...
scene direction: they both drag buffy [faith] to the back of the armored truck.
collins: skip the speech.
scene direction: they pull her in the truck.
collins: let's go.
scene direction: the doors close.
scene change: *** act 2 ***
scene direction: faith [buffy] enters giles' home.
giles: buffy. good.
faith [buffy]: the scooby gang's all here. willow, xander, and...
scene direction: faith [buffy] looks at anya
faith [buffy]: everybody. what's up?
giles: it's about faith, not surprisingly.
faith [buffy]: didn't joyce tell you? i already kicked that ass.
xander: i feel a high five coming on.
willow: where is she?
faith [buffy]: on her way to the big house. cops took her off my hands about an hour ago. poetic justice.
anya: how's that?
faith [buffy]: well, she did all those crimes, and now she's being arrested.
scene direction: silence.
faith [buffy]: i guess that's just regular justice.
scene direction: willow smiles.
faith [buffy]: it's cool, anyway.
giles: unless i'm mistaken, faith is no longer in police custody.
scene direction: faith [buffy] stands
faith [buffy]: what are you talking about?
giles: watcher's council. they, uh sent a retrieval team to capture faith.
faith [buffy]: well, yeah, i mean, 'cause it worked so well when wesley tried it.
giles: this is a special operations unit. they, uh, handle the council's trickier jobs - smuggling, interrogation, wetworks.
willow: what's wetworks?
xander: scuba-type stuff.
anya: i thought it was murder.
xander: well, yeah, but there could be underwater murder, with snorkels.
faith [buffy]: so they're taking her to england?
giles: it'll be a long, long time before she returns.
faith [buffy]: heh heh heh. ahhh hah hah. hah hah. ohhh i'm sorry. it's just...i'm happy. faith is evil.
willow: yeah. i hope they throw the book at her.
giles: i'm not sure there is a, a book for this.
willow: they could throw other things.
faith [buffy]: i forgot how much you don't like faith.
willow: after what she's done to you? oh, i wish those council guys would let me have an hour alone in the room with her, if i was larger and had grenades.
faith [buffy]: i bet i know what faith would say to that.
scene direction: in faith [buffy]'s head she springs forward with a knife and sticks it in willow's stomach in the same place faith was stabbed. she pulls the knife out and stabs willow again.
scene direction: faith [buffy] lifts her head from her revelry. she did not spring forward.
anya: so what you're saying is that everything's fine?
giles: oh, um, yes.
anya: well, i'm glad you called us all here because that information could never be conveyed by telephone.
scene direction: willow to buffy
willow: what's up?
giles: well, i just thought it was, uh, best to convene, in case there were any loose ends...
scene direction: faith [buffy] to willow
faith [buffy]: i'd never let her hurt you.
giles: ...or things that we might have forgotten.
scene direction: willow to buffy
willow: i know.
giles: but if you're, uh, keen to go, then, please, by all means, go.
xander: we kind of have a romantic evening planned.
anya: we were gonna light a bunch of candles and have sex near them.
faith [buffy]: well, we certainly don't want to cut into that seven minutes.
anya: hey.
xander: i believe that's my hey. hey!
faith [buffy]: lighten up. we're out of danger. everything's good.
giles: we still have adam to take care of.
faith [buffy]: yeah. adam. what's up with him?
giles: i wish we knew.
faith [buffy]: well, don't worry about it. i'll patrol tonight, as long as it takes. you guys have your fun, i'll be out there doing my job.
scene change: cut to faith [buffy] dancing in the bronze to rock band.
faith [buffy]: whoop.
spike: oh, you.
faith [buffy]: and you.
spike: what, are you keeping tabs on me? you're gonna give me a hard time now?
faith [buffy]: um, do i usually give you a hard time?
spike: very funny. well, you don't have to worry about me drinking. unless you're here to protect innocent beers.
scene direction: spike holds up a bottle.
scene direction: spike walks away a little and faith [buffy] follows.
faith [buffy]: you're a vampire.
spike: was. and as soon as i get this chip out of my head, i'll be a vampire again. but until then, i'm just as helpless as a kitten up a tree. so why don't you sod off?
faith [buffy]: ok.
scene direction: spike angrily
spike: oh, fine! throw it in my face! spike's not a threat anymore. i'll turn my back. he can't hurt me.
faith [buffy]: spike?
scene direction: faith [buffy] gets it.
faith [buffy]: spike. william the bloody with a chip in his head. i kind of love this town.
spike: you know why i really hate you, summers?
faith [buffy]: 'cause i'm a stuck-up tight-ass with no sense of fun?
spike: well, yeah, that covers a lot of it.
faith [buffy]: cause i could do anything i want, and instead, i choose to pout and whine and feel the burden of slayerness? i mean, i could be rich, i could be famous, i could have anything. anyone.
scene direction: faith [buffy] moves closer and puts her hands on spike's chest.
faith [buffy]: even you, spike. i could ride you at a gallop until your legs buckled and your eyes rolled up. i've got muscles you've never even dreamed of. i could squeeze you until you popped like warm champagne, and you'd beg me to hurt you just a little bit more. and you know why i don't?
scene direction: faith [buffy] moves closer and looks up at him pursing her lips.
faith [buffy]: because it's wrong. humh humh.
scene direction: faith [buffy] moves off.
spike: i get this chip out, you and me are gonna have a confrontation.
faith [buffy]: count on it.
scene direction: spike throws his bottle into the wall and walks off. he shoves someone and clutches his head.
scene change: cut to the sewers.
scene direction: four vampires are walking in vamp face.
vampire: it was too crowded. we gotta hold out for a few hours, pick up a straggler, some drunk. can't be calling attention to
scene direction: vampire sees adam and stops.
vampire: ourselves.
adam: i've been thinking. about vampires.
vampire: this is my place.
adam: you're place. yes. the sewers. you hide from them, crawl about in their filth. scavenging like rats. what do you fear?
vampire: kill this guy already.
scene direction: one vampire charges adam and adam grabs it by the throat and holds it.
adam: you fear the cross. the sun. fire. and, oh, yes...
scene direction: adams puts his other hand on the vampire's shoulder and he lifts the vampire's head from its shoulders. the body falls and he drops the head on it and they turn to dust.
adam: i believe decapitation is a problem as well.
vampire: you can have the place. i mean, we don't have to stay here anymore.
adam: you fear death. being immortal, you fear it more than those to whom it comes naturally. vampires are a paradox.
vampire: ok, we're a paradox. that's cool.
adam: demon in a human body. you walk in both worlds and belong to neither. i can relate. come. we have a lot to talk about.
scene change: cut to warehouse.
scene direction: in the back of the armored truck, buffy [faith] wakes up and finds she is chained.
weatherby: well, it's awake.
buffy [faith]: who are you?
weatherby: council. we're taking you back to the mother country. seems you've been a naughty girl.
buffy [faith]: listen to me. y-you've made a mistake. i am not faith. i'm buffy summers. faith performed some kind of spell, she switched our bodies.
scene direction: collins standing outside the truck.
collins: congratulations. no one's ever actually tried that one on me before.
buffy [faith]: you have to find faith. c-call giles. j-just get him here.
collins: giles doesn't work for the council anymore. for that matter, neither does buffy summers. and what you are, miss, is a package. i deliver the package. i don't much care what's inside.
scene direction: collins to weatherby.
collins: come on.
weatherby: he may not care, but i do. the watcher's council used to mean something. you perverted it. you trash. we should have killed you while you were asleep.
scene direction: he spits in buffy [faith]'s face. he gets out of the truck and closes the doors.
scene change: cut to the bronze.
willow: i can't believe you've never been here. the bronze is the coolest place in sunnydale. of-of course, there's not a lot of competition. i think the vending machine at bergen's came in second.
tara: y-you used to come here a lot?
others: chug chug chug willow: i lived here. me, xander...
faith [buffy]: chug, chug, chug.
willow: buffy.
faith [buffy]: chug, chug, chug.
faith [buffy]: oooh ooooh.

faith [buffy]: you're nothing but a disappointment.
scene direction: tara crosses her arms.
willow: hey, buffy.
faith [buffy]: willow and - uh willow: buffy, this is tara.
tara: hi.
faith [buffy]: so we've never met.
scene direction: tara shakes her head.
faith [buffy]: cool. just have a thing with names.
willow: tara was in my wicca group.
faith [buffy]: unh-huh.
scene direction: faith [buffy] walks away and they follow.
willow: so, what's up?
scene direction: faith [buffy] plops herself on a couch.
willow: patrol a no-go?
scene direction: faith [buffy] throws her legs up in the air and on a table.
faith [buffy]: got tired. you know, the whole faith thing. i let off some steam.
willow: good for you. you shouldn't work yourself too hard.
faith [buffy]: that's my philosophy.
scene direction: faith [buffy] throws her arms behind her head.
willow: anyone want a soda?
scene direction: tara looks at willow
tara: water.
scene direction: faith [buffy] shakes head. willow walks off and faith [buffy] notes tara looking back at willow. she sits up and leans forward.
faith [buffy]: so you guys been hanging out a lot lately, huh?
tara: yeah. she's, um, she's really cool.
scene direction: faith [buffy] nods and blinks slowly.
scene direction: faith [buffy] grins
faith [buffy]: so willow's not driving stick anymore. who would have thought? i guess you never really know someone until you've been inside their skin. and oz is out of the picture? oh, never seen two people so much in love. she just couldn't get enough of old oz.
tara: she, um, said he, uh, uh, w-w-w-w-w-went faith [buffy]: he w-w-w-w-what? you gonna get that sentence out sometime tonight?
scene direction: tara lowers her head.
scene direction: willow returns.
willow: buffy, guy in the corner.
scene direction: faith [buffy] looks at a guy leading a girl.
faith [buffy]: yeah. good call.
tara: what?
willow: vampire.
faith [buffy]: wicked obvious.
scene direction: faith [buffy] leans back and realizes willow is waiting.
faith [buffy]: so i should slay him.
scene direction: faith [buffy] gets up.
willow: you want help?
buffy: nah, i got it.
scene direction: faith [buffy] picks up a pool stick as she walks. she enters a back area where the vampire is feeding on the girl from behind, making slurping noises and holding the girl's arms. the girl is gasping. faith [buffy] breaks the pool stick in two and drops one end. the girl's arms flail. faith [buffy] hits the vampire in the back using the stake as a club.
faith [buffy]: hey!
scene direction: the vampire lets the girl fall and turns. faith [buffy] blocks a right and a left. she kicks it in the leg and spins the vampire around and holds it. she stakes it and throws it to the side just before it dusts.
scene direction: faith [buffy] exhales and looks down at the girl. she is squatting and she looks up at faith [buffy].
faith [buffy]: you'll live.
girl: uh he was so strong, uh.
faith [buffy]: yeah, well, he's gone now.
scene direction: faith [buffy] turns and the girl grabs her hand.
girl: thank you.
scene direction: girl earnestly
girl: thank you.
scene direction: expressions flash across faith [buffy]'s face.
faith [buffy]: yeah.
scene direction: faith [buffy] shrugs
faith [buffy]: it's cool.
scene direction: faith [buffy] shrugs
scene direction: faith [buffy] walks off and drops the stake.
willow: everything poofed?
faith [buffy]: all's well in the world.
willow: tara's not feeling well. i'm gonna walk her home.
scene direction: willow looks back at tara.
faith [buffy]: yeah. you give her whatever she needs.
scene direction: faith [buffy] smiles for a second.
willow: are you gonna be in later, or you going over to riley's?
scene direction: faith [buffy] blinks several times and then smiles.
scene change: cut to warehouse.
scene direction: banging sounds.
scene direction: smith walks toward the armored truck with a syringe.
smith: this'll bloody keep you quiet.
scene direction: smith opens the back of the truck and goes in.
scene direction: buffy [faith] grabs him and gets him in a chokehold with the chains.
smith: ugh.
buffy [faith]: how about this? i'll be quiet, and you can scream.
smith: aaahh.
scene direction: weatherby and collins look in from the back of the truck.
buffy [faith]: now you unchain me - very slowly and! politely, or i kill this guy.
collins: when we go on a job, we always put our affairs in order first, in case of accident.
smith: collins...
collins: sorry, smithy.
scene direction: they walk off.
collins: she's starting to bother me.
weatherby: getting her across the border is gonna be a lot more trouble than it's worth.
collins: if the council can even get us passage. i'll call them. it's time for a contingency plan.
scene direction: smith flies out the back of the truck and falls, groaning.
scene change: cut to riley's room.
scene direction: riley is sitting at his desk and hears a sound and turns, smiling. faith [buffy] is standing in the doorway.
faith [buffy]: hi, baby.
scene change: *** act 3 ***
scene change: cut to tara's room.
willow: i'm sorry you're feeling all blechy. but we'll get together with buffy another time. sometime soon. i think you'll really like her.
scene direction: tara sighs.
tara: she's not your friend.
willow: i may have overestimated the "you liking her" factor.
tara: no, no. i mean, i don't...
scene direction: tara sighs
tara: i don't think she's...her.
willow: you lost me.
tara: well, um, a person's energy has a flow, a unity.
scene direction: tara sighs
tara: buffy's was
scene direction: tara sighs
tara: was fragmented. it-it grated, like something forced in where it doesn't belong. plus, she was, um,
scene direction: tara sighs
tara: she was kind of mean.
scene direction: tara laughs sadly
willow: so you think buffy's not herself? like she's been possessed or something?
scene direction: tara sighs
tara: i'm not sure.
willow: you didn't sense a hyena energy at all, did you? because hyena possession is just...unpleasant.
tara: do you have anything of hers?
willow: of buffy's? uhhhh. oh! this ring.
tara: i-i think there's a way we can, hmm...
scene direction: tara reaches for book
tara: the passage to the nether realm. there-there's a ritual. if you can find buffy there, you should be able to see.
willow: if it'll help her.
scene direction: tara sighs.
willow: what?
tara: well, the nether realm exists beyond the physical world. accessing it is... i-it-it's kind of like astral projection. it's very intense. i'd have to be your anchor, keep you on this plane.
scene direction: willow nods
willow: i trust you.
tara: it-it's not like anything that we've ever...
