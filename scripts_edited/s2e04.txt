scene direction: outside the museum. buffy, willow and xander are walking past the rose gardens toward the building.
buffy: this is so unfair.
willow: i don't think it's that bad.
buffy: it's the ueber-suck. mom could've at least warned me.
xander: well, a lot of parents are doing it this year. it's part of this whole cultural exchange magilla. the exhibit, the dance...
willow: i have the best costume for the dance!
buffy: a complete stranger in my house for two weeks. i'm gonna be insane! a danger to myself and others within three days, i swear.
xander: i think the exchange student program's cool.
scene direction: xander gets a look from buffy
xander: i do! it's a beautiful melding of two cultures.
buffy: have you ever done an exchange program?
xander: my dad tried to send me to some armenians once. does that count?
scene direction: they climb the steps to the building entrance and the cultural exchange exhibit. cut inside. cordelia and two other girls are looking over the pictures of the exchange students.
cordelia: ooo! there's mine! sven. isn't he lunchable? mine's definitely the best.
scene direction: she walks past buffy.
buffy: what're you lookin' at?
cordelia: pictures of our exchange students. look. 100% swedish, 100% gorgeous, 100% staying at my house! so, how's yours? visually, i mean.
buffy: i don't know. guy like?
xander: by guy-like we are talking big, beefy, guy-like girl, right?
buffy: i was just told 'guy'.
cordelia: you didn't look at him first? he could be dogly. you live on the edge.
scene direction: cordelia walks off
xander: hold on a sec. so, this person who's living with you for two weeks is a man. with man parts. this is a terrible idea.
willow: what about the beautiful melding of two cultures?
xander: there's no melding, okay? he better keep his parts to himself.
scene direction: they stop at the end of a row of display cases, and buffy notices rodney scraping a mask.
buffy: what's he doing?
xander: uh, that's rodney munson. he's god's gift to the bell curve.
scene direction: another student goes up to rodney and gets growled at.
xander: what he lacks in smarts he makes up in lack of smarts.
willow: you just don't like him 'cause of that time he beat you up every day for five years.
scene direction: buffy giggles to herself.
xander: yeah. i'm irrational that way.
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: i better stop him before he gets in trouble.
willow: i got it. the non-violent approach is probably better here.
scene direction: willow goes over to rodney
buffy: i wasn't gonna use violence. i don't always use violence.
scene direction: buffy looks up at xander
buffy: do i?
xander: the important thing is *you* believe that.
scene change: cut to rodney. he's still scraping the mask.
rodney: what're you...
scene direction: rodney looks up
rodney: oh. willow, hi.
willow: that's probably not something you're supposed to be doing. you could get in trouble.
scene direction: rodney facetiously
rodney: oh, no. and they might kick me outta school?
scene direction: willow smiles
willow: are we still on for our chem tutorial tomorrow?
rodney: yeah. i think i got almost all fourteen natural elements memorized.
willow: there're a hundred and three.
scene change: rodney suddenly looks worried. cut to the museum guide.
guide: welcome, students. we shall now proceed into the incan burial chamber. the human sacrifice is about to begin.
scene change: cut to the entry to the inca exhibit. they all walk in.
xander: typical museum trick. promise human sacrifice, deliver old pots and pans.
guide: five hundred years ago, the incan people chose a beautiful teenage girl to become their princess.
scene direction: they take the steps up to a platform where the incan stone coffin and mummy are on display.
willow: i hope this story ends with, 'and she lived happily ever after.' xander:
scene direction: willow looks into the coffin
willow: no, i think it ends with, 'and she became a scary, discolored, shriveled mummy.' guide: the incan people sacrificed their princess to the mountain god sebancaya, an offering buried alive for eternity in this dark tomb.
willow: they could've at least wrapped her in those nice white bandages, like in the movies?
guide: the princess remained there protected only by a cursed seal placed there
scene direction: guide points to the plate in the mummy's hands
guide: as a warning to any who would wake her.
scene direction: cordelia and a few other girls are still looking at the exchange student pictures and laughing.
xander: so, buffy, when's exchange-o boy making his appearance?
buffy: his name's ampata. gonna be at the bus station tomorrow night.
xander: ooo. the sunnydale bus depot. classy! what a better way to introduce someone to our country than with the stench of urine.
guide: now, if you'll follow me this way, please.
scene direction: they all walk past the coffin and follow the guide to the next destination on the tour.
scene change: cut to later. the exhibit is deserted now except for rodney, who cautiously looks around and makes his way back up to the mummy. he looks into the stone coffin and sees the plate with the seal.
rodney: aha. cool.
scene direction: he reaches in and yanks at the plate, trying to wrest it from the mummy's grip. he gets it out of one hand, and yanks it hard to get it out of the other. it comes loose, and he pulls it up too fast, breaking it against the side of the coffin.
rodney: oh! damn!
scene direction: he reaches in to collect the pieces. the mummy's arms reach up and grab him by the neck. its eyelids open to reveal empty sockets as it pulls him in closer.
scene direction: opening credits roll. buffy's theme plays.
scene change: *** part 1 ***
scene change: sunnydale high. students are arriving for school. cut to the library.
scene direction: buffy and giles are training. xander is studying at the table.
buffy: so, can i go?
giles: i think not.
scene direction: buffy lands four hard hits on the training pad giles is holding. he flinches at her blows, and after she's done puts the pad down in favor of a much thicker one.
scene direction: buffy pouts
buffy: how come?
giles: because you are the chosen one.
buffy: mm. just this once i'd like to be the overlooked one.
giles: well, i'm... afraid that is not...
scene direction: buffy kicks the pad hard, making giles stagger back a few steps.
giles: you have responsibilities that other girls do not.
buffy: oh! i know this one! slaying entails certain sacrifices, blah, blah, bity blah, i'm so stuffy, gimme a scone.
scene direction: giles sarcastically
giles: it's as if you know me.
scene direction: buffy continues kicking. xander winces at each blow.
giles: your secret identity is gonna be difficult enough to maintain while this exchange student is living with you.
scene direction: xander gets up and separates them.
xander: nooot... *with* her. in the same house as her. am i the only one who's objective enough to make that distinction?
scene direction: xander goes to the counter
buffy: so! i think going to the dance like a normal person would be the best way to keep that secret. giles, come on, budge! no one likes a non- budger.
scene direction: giles doesn't say a word. she steps back and comes at him for an especially hard kick.
giles: fine!
scene direction: buffy stops her kick at the last instant.
giles: go.
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: yay! i win.
giles: i'll just go and introduce my shoulder to a, an icepack.
scene direction: xander hops off of the counter
xander: so, i guess we're dance-bound. cool. i think i can get my mom's car, so i'm wheel man.
buffy: i thought you were taking willow.
xander: well, yeah, i'm gonna take willow, but i'm not gonna *take* willow. in the sense of 'take me'. see, with you we're three and everybody's safe. without you, we're two.
buffy: ah, and we enter dateville. romance, flowers...
xander: lips.
scene direction: willow comes into the library, but xander's back is to the door so he doesn't see her. buffy pretends not to notice her.
buffy: oh, come on. in all the years you've know willow, you've never thought about her lips?
xander: buffy, i love willow.
scene direction: willow smiles widely.
xander: and she's my best friend. which makes her not the kind of girl who i think about her lips that much.
scene direction: willow's smile fades to disappointment.
xander: she's the kind of girl that... i'm best friends with.
willow: hey guys.
xander: willow!
scene direction: xander goes to her
xander: hi! we were just talkin' about happy things.
scene direction: he puts his arm around her and pulls her over to buffy at the table.
xander: like the three of us going to the dance together. see?
scene direction: xander laughs
xander: happy!
scene direction: willow isn't smiling.
xander: not happy.
willow: no. uh, oh, y-yes. no. rodney's missing.
scene direction: giles comes out of his office with an ice pack
giles: trouble with mr. munson again?
scene direction: giles puts it on his shoulder
willow: his parents say he never came home last night.
buffy: y'know, i don't think i remember seeing rodney on the bus back from the field trip.
willow: i didn't either. i hope he didn't get in trouble at the museum.
scene direction: xander chuckles
xander: hey, maybe he awakened the mummy.
scene direction: willow giggles
willow: right, and it rose from its tomb.
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: and attacked him.
scene direction: buffy nods
scene direction: their smiles fade as they all realize that that may not be so far- fetched.
scene change: cut to the inca exhibit at the museum. they all come walking in.
willow: on the other hand, maybe rodney just stepped out for a smoke.
xander: for twenty-one hours?
willow: it's addictive, you know.
giles: we'll deal with that when we've... ruled out evil curses.
scene direction: they climb the steps to the platform where the coffin is on display.
buffy: one day i'm gonna live in a town where evil curses are just generally ruled out without even saying.
giles: there was a seal?
scene direction: buffy steps up to the coffin and looks in.
buffy: it was right here. and it's broken.
scene direction: buffy picks up the largest piece
willow: does that mean the mummy's loose?
buffy: no, comfy as ever.
scene direction: buffy hands the piece to giles
giles: look at this series of pictograms.
scene direction: a man comes out of nowhere and yells, jumps up behind xander and swings at him with a knife. xander ducks the blow and gets behind him. the man swings back the other way again blindly, looks into the coffin and is surprised by what he sees there. xander jumps onto the man's back. he knocks xander off, and runs off of the platform and away. xander quickly gets up.
xander: okay, i just saved us, right?
buffy: something did.
giles: well, we'll fret about the details later. let's just get out of here before he comes back.
scene direction: they all hurry down the steps to leave except willow, who's noticed something about the mummy.
willow: giles, were the incas very advanced?
giles: yes, yes, very.
willow: did they have orthodontists?
scene change: cut to the mummy. there are metal braces on its teeth.
scene change: cut to the library. they all come in.
willow: rodney looked like he had been dead for five hundred years. how could that be?
xander: maybe we should ask that crazy man with the big old knife.
buffy: i don't think he seemed overly chatty.
willow: the way he bolted when he saw rodney, i'd say he was as freaked as we were.
giles: my resources on this subject are extremely limited. i-i gather that this particular mummy was from the sebancaya region of eastern peru. it's very remote. now, if there's an answer, then it's, it's locked in the...
buffy: ...in the seal.
scene direction: giles looks at the seal
giles: it's gonna take me weeks to... translate these pictograms. well, we'll start tonight with...
buffy: ampata!
giles: i was gonna suggest hunting.
buffy: no, i'm late. i told my mom i'd pick him up.
xander: uh-uh-uh, buffy? where are your priorities? tracking down a mummifying killer or making time for some latin lover whose stock in trade is the breakage of hearts?
buffy: ampata's there alone. and i-i don't know how good his english is. he's here from south a... south america. hey, y'know, maybe he could translate the seal.
xander: oh, yeah. fall for the old 'let me translate that ancient seal for ya' come on. tsh. d'ya know how many times i've used that?
scene change: cut to the bus stations. ampata is standing there alone waiting and looking around for his ride. he hears a whisper.
mummy: ampata...
scene direction: he starts walking in the direction of the voice, passing several parked busses. he hears the voice again, louder this time.
mummy: ampata...
scene direction: he walks between two busses, looking around for whoever it is.
ampata: hello?
scene direction: he sees the mummy come toward him, and is surprised and frightened but doesn't scream or yell. the mummy reaches out, grabs him by the neck, pulls him in and kisses him. ampata begins to shrivel and dry up as the mummy draws his life force from him.
scene change: cut to later. buffy, willow and xander arrive at the bus station and look for him.
buffy: forty minutes late. welcome to america!
willow: what if he left already?
scene direction: willow finds the door to the station building locked.
scene direction: buffy calls out
buffy: ampata? ampata gutierrez?
xander: so, do we have to speak spanish when we see him? 'cause i don't know anything much besides doritos and chihuahua.
buffy: ampata?
ampata: here!
scene direction: the mummy had regained her appearance of a young teenage girl. she comes walking out from between two busses.
ampata: hello.
scene direction: xander is instantly taken with her beauty. she comes over and stands before them.
ampata: i am ampata.
xander: ay caramba! i can also say that!
scene direction: buffy and willow are also surprised to find that ampata is a girl.
scene direction: willow looks up at xander and sees how he's looking at her.
scene change: *** part 2 ***
scene direction: the summers house. buffy is showing ampata around the house.
buffy: dining room...
scene direction: they come into the kitchen from the dining room.
buffy: and this
scene direction: buffy turns on the light
buffy: is the kitchen.
scene direction: ampata amazed
ampata: it's very good!
buffy: yeah, you got your stove, your fridge, it's fully functional. we're very into it.
scene direction: xander slow and over-pronounced
xander: would you like a drink?
scene direction: xander gestures
scene direction: buffy opens the fridge
buffy: uh, let's see, we've got milk, and, uh, oh, older milk... juice?
ampata: please.
willow: so, ampata. you're a girl.
ampata: yes. for many years now.
willow: and not a boy, 'cause we thought a boy was coming, and here ya are in a girl way!
xander: it's just one of those crazy mix-ups, will.
buffy: so, have you ever been to america before?
scene direction: buffy sets out glasses
ampata: uh, i, i have toured.
scene direction: xander slow english again
xander: where did... you go?
scene direction: buffy gives willow a look, and goes to get something to munch on as willow pours the juice.
ampata: i was taken to atlanta, boston, new york.
willow: new york! that's exciting. what was that like?
ampata: i did not see so much.
xander: your english is... very bueno.
scene direction: buffy and willow exchange another look at xander's deliberately slow speech.
ampata: i listened much.
xander: well, that works out well, because i talk much.
scene direction: xander they laugh
scene change: cut to later in buffy's room. ampata sits down on her bed, surprised at the springiness of it.
buffy: hey! sorry about the teeniness of the room.
ampata: my old one was much smaller.
scene direction: buffy sits on her bed
buffy: what's it like back home?
ampata: cramped, and... very dead.
buffy: well, you'll feel right at home in sunnydale.
ampata: oh, no! ohhhh!
scene direction: ampata gets up
ampata: but... but you have so *much* here!
scene direction: ampata picks up a picture
buffy: how 'bout friends?
ampata: they are...
scene direction: ampata puts the picture down
ampata: it is just me.
buffy: i've been there. but, hey! you'll meet lots of people tomorrow.
ampata: thank you.
scene direction: ampata goes back to her bed
ampata: you must teach me everything about your life. i want to fit in, buffy. just like you. a normal life.
buffy: one normal life. comin' up.
scene direction: she reaches over to turn off her light. cut outside. the man from the museum is hidden there looking in through the window from the bushes.
scene change: cut to outside the school the next morning. cordelia and devon come down some stairs to oz's van.
cordelia: devon, i told you i'd be at the dance tonight, but i am *not* one of your little groupies. i won't be all doe-eyed looking up at you, standing at the edge of the stage.
devon: got it.
cordelia: so, i'll see you afterwards?
devon: sure. where do you wanna meet?
cordelia: i'll be standing at the edge of the stage.
scene direction: devon looks over at sven
devon: with that guy?
scene direction: cordelia looks also
cordelia: sven! momento! needa!
scene direction: cordelia to devon
cordelia: this whole student exchange thing has been a horrible nightmare. they don't even speak american. so, i'll see you later?
scene direction: cordelia she allows him a kiss on the cheek
cordelia: bye!
scene direction: she starts back up the stairs toward the school. she turns back when she notices that sven isn't following.
cordelia: sven! come?
scene direction: sven starts to follow her. devon smirks and goes over to oz, who's dealing with their equipment.
devon: oz, man! what do you think?
oz: of what?
devon: cordelia, man!
oz: she's a wonderland tour.
devon: you gotta admit, the girl is hot!
oz: yeah, she's a hot girl.
devon: let me guess: not your type? what does a girl have to do to impress you?
oz: well, it involves a feathered boa and a theme to 'a summer place'. i can't discuss it here.
devon: you're too picky, man. do you know how many girls you could have? you're lead guitar, oz. it's currency!
oz: i'm not picky. you're just impressed by any pretty girl that can walk and talk.
devon: she doesn't have to talk.
scene direction: oz just smirks.
scene change: cut to willow and xander walking.
willow: i worked really hard on my costume. it's pretty cool.
xander: okay, but what about me? i've gotta think.
willow: well, it's a celebration of cultures. there are lots of dress- up alternatives.
xander: and a corresponding equal number of mocking alternatives. all aimed at me.
willow: bavarians are cool.
xander: okay, no shirts with ruffles, no hats with feathers and definitely no lederhosen. they make my calves look fat.
willow: why are you suddenly so worried about looking like an idiot?
scene direction: that came out wrong.
scene change: xander didn't take offense because he's too busy looking at buffy and ampata arriving for school. willow notices and looks also. cut to buffy and ampata.
buffy: your first day of school. nervous?
ampata: it is just more people than i have seen in a long time.
buffy: ah, don't worry. you will have no problems making friends. as a matter of fact, i know someone who's dying to meet you.
scene change: cut to the library. giles gets right to it.
scene direction: giles shakes her hand, smiles
giles: how do you do?
ampata: hi.
giles: i was, i was wondering if you could, um, translate this?
scene direction: giles shows her the seal
buffy: that was in no way awkward.
scene direction: ampata takes it and looks at it in disbelief.
buffy: something wrong?
ampata: uh, no! uh, it is... uh, why are you asking me?
giles: well, uh, uh...
scene direction: giles coughs
giles: it's, well, it's an artifact... from, from, uh, your... region. i-it's, uh, from the tomb of a-an incan mummy, a-a-actually. we were trying to translate it, uh, um, as a-a project for our, um...
willow: our archeology club.
scene direction: giles impressed with her quick thinking
giles: very good.
ampata: it is broken. where are the other pieces?
buffy: that's all we found.
ampata: hmm. it is very old and valuable.
scene direction: ampata to giles, holding the seal out to him
ampata: you should hide it!
giles: is, is, uh, anything you recognize here? um, um, this, this, um... this ch-chap here with the knife, for instance?
ampata: well, i-i do not know exactly, but... i-i-i think this represents, i believe the word is... 'bodyguard'?
scene direction: giles takes the seal
giles: bodyguard? interesting.
ampata: legend has it that he guards the mummy against those who would disturb her.
giles: well, uh, yes, well, that's, um, that's a very good starting point for our, um... club.
scene direction: giles looks at buffy
giles: um...
buffy: oh, and, uh, a-as club president, i have, um, lots to do. lots of... stuff. dull stuff. uh, oh, willow, maybe you could...
xander: stay with ampata for the day. i'd love to.
scene direction: xander bows slightly and smiles
scene direction: ampata smiles
ampata: yes! that will be fun.
scene direction: xander gestures for ampata to go ahead of him. as she walks out he turns to buffy and willow, lets out a breath, and follows her. willow watches them go.
giles: right. i'll, uh, continue with the translation. buffy, you research this, uh, bodyguard thing, and, uh, willow...
scene direction: giles turns around
giles: willow?
scene direction: willow still staring after them
willow: boy. they really like each other.
scene change: cut to the bleachers on the football field. xander and ampata are sitting about two-thirds of the way up.
xander: and this
scene direction: xander reaches into his satchel
xander: is called a snack food.
scene direction: xander holds up a twinkie
ampata: snack food?
xander: yeah. it's a delicious, spongy, golden cake stuffed with a delightful creamy, white substance of goodness. and here's how you eat it.
scene direction: he stuffs the whole thing into his mouth. ampata laughs at the sight.
xander: mm-hm.
ampata: oh, but now i cannot try it.
scene direction: xander with a full mouth
xander: that's why you bring two.
scene direction: he produces another one from his bag and hands it to her.
ampata: oh!
scene direction: ampata studies it
ampata: here goes!
scene direction: she pulls her windswept hair back from her face and proceeds to stuff most of the twinkie into her mouth. she laughs with delight.
scene direction: xander mouth still full
xander: good, huh? and the exciting part is that they have no ingredients that a human can pronounce. so it doesn't leave you with that heavy... food feeling in your stomach.
scene direction: she squeals with laughter.
scene direction: ampata mouth full
ampata: you are strange.
xander: girls always tell me that. right before they run away.
ampata: i like it!
xander: i like you like it!
scene direction: she can't help but laugh more at that.
xander: please, don't learn from my english.
scene change: cut to the library. buffy is inspecting the seal under a magnifying lamp.
buffy: ha! or possible ha.
scene direction: buffy to willow
buffy: do you think this matches?
scene direction: willow is off in her own world, idly playing with her stuffed frog.
buffy: hey!
willow: oh! yes. i'm caring about mummies.
buffy: ampata's only staying two weeks.
willow: yeah. and then xander can find someone else who's not me to obsess about. at least with you i knew he didn't have a shot. well, you know, i have a choice. i can spend my life waiting for xander to go out with every other girl in the world until he notices me, or i can just get on with my life.
buffy: good for you.
willow: well, i didn't choose yet.
scene direction: giles inspecting the seal
giles: good lord!
scene direction: giles to buffy
giles: good work!
buffy: my work?
giles: yes. this is most illuminating. it seems rodney's killer might be the mummy.
willow: where does it say that?
giles: well, here. it implies that the mummy is capable of... feeding on the life force of a person, effectively freeze-drying them, you might say. extraordinary.
buffy: so, then we just have to stop the mummy. which leads to the question: how do we a) find, and b) stop the mummy?
giles: well, the answer to that is somewhere still in here. or in the rest of the seal.
scene direction: cut outside to the bleachers. the bodyguard attacks xander with his large knife. ampata screams as she and xander quickly move apart and the knife hits the seat between them.
bodyguard: you stole the seal! where is it?!
scene direction: he swings again, but xander scoots back more and then rolls down two levels of seats. the bodyguard comes at him again and tries to stab him, but xander catches his arm and stops him. ampata screams again. the bodyguard looks back at her and recognizes her.
bodyguard: it is you!
scene direction: xander kicks him off, and he rolls down the bleachers and to the ground.
scene direction: ampata grabs xander's satchel, helps him up and they run away.
scene change: cut to the library. giles comes out of his office with a cup of tea, and sets it on the table in front of ampata.
giles: here you are.
ampata: thank you.
willow: why's this guy so into us? i mean, what's he want?
xander: he said, 'give me the seal.' giles: apparently this is more popular than we realized. i just don't know what we, we should do with it.
ampata: destroy it.
scene direction: ampata gets a surprised look from giles
ampata: if you do not, someone could die.
giles: i'm afraid someone already has.
ampata: you mean the man with the knife killed someone?
buffy: uh, no. well, not exactly.
ampata: you are not telling me everything.
scene direction: ampata looks at them all
xander: you're right, ampata.
scene direction: xander takes her hand
xander: and it's time we do. we're not an archeology club. we're in, uh...
scene direction: giles interrupts by clearing his throat. buffy gives him a stern look.
xander: we're in the crime club. which is kinda like the chess club, only with crime, and, um... no chess.
ampata: please understand me. that seal nearly got us killed. it must be destroyed!
scene direction: she gets up and runs from the library. a moment later xander gets up and runs out after her.
xander: ampata!
scene direction: buffy and willow look at each other a bit surprised and confused.
scene change: cut to the hall. ampata is sitting on a bench. xander crouches down beside her.
xander: ampata, listen to me. nobody's gonna hurt you. i won't let them.
ampata: your investigation is dangerous. i do not want that. just normal life!
scene direction: she gets up and goes over to the drinking fountain. xander stands back up and follows her, but stays back and lets her drink. willow comes out of the library.
willow: is she okay?
xander: wigged. i'm tryin' to convince her that our lives aren't just danger and peril around here.
scene direction: willow looks over at ampata sympathetically, then back to xander.
willow: you should take her to the dance.
xander: that's a good idea! we'll all go!
willow: no, i mean just you.
xander: but you were psyched! and your costume!
willow: i'll see you there.
xander: you know what, willow? you're my best friend.
scene direction: he goes over to ampata.
willow: i know.
scene direction: willow walks off
scene change: cut to the library.
buffy: i don't get it. why would the bodyguard have such a jones for a broken piece of rock?
giles: well, um, perhaps... he needs to put it together with the other pieces.
buffy: if he has them. i mean, we didn't find them.
giles: and if he didn't then, then they'd still be at the museum.
buffy: so, maybe we should go there and find them. and odds are he'll show up, too, right?
giles: and hopefully we'll be ready.
buffy: hey! look at us! we came up with a plan. a good plan.
giles: alright. we'll meet there tonight after it closes.
buffy: no! bad plan. i have other plans. dance plans.
scene direction: buffy gets a stern look from giles
scene direction: buffy exhales
buffy: canceled plans.

scene direction: ampata laughs
ampata: why was that so scary?
xander: well, because you never know if a girl's gonna say 'yes', or if... she's gonna laugh in your face and pull out your still beating heart and crush it into the ground with her heel.
ampata: hmm. then you are very courageous. can i tell you a secret?
xander: hmm.

buffy: cool! a princess.

giles: no, he's already been found. in a school restroom. mummified.
buffy: okay, i don't get it. why would the mummy kill her own bodyguard?
giles: well, i've cross-referenced, and, uh, i've looked at the pictograms anew. he was a guard alright. but it was his job to insure that the mummy didn't awaken and escape.

giles: perhaps.
buffy: hold on a sec. she was wiggy about the seal from minute one.

buffy: uh, waiting...
giles: well, we already know that the seal was used to contain the mummy. if breaking it freed her...
buffy: ...reassembling it will trap her.

xander: what, you think that you don't deserve me?
scene direction: xander laughs
xander: man, i love you!
scene direction: she sheds a few tears and looks up at him sorrowfully. his smile fades.

scene direction: ampata shoves giles into the coffin
ampata: you're not a normal girl.
buffy: and you are?
scene direction: she does a roundhouse kick to ampata's face and another kick to her side. she throws a punch, but ampata is strong, too, and catches buffy's fist and swings her around onto the rim of the coffin. she grabs buffy's neck and tries to choke her. buffy headbutts ampata, making her stagger back. she tries to kick but ampata ducks it. buffy lunges for her, and ampata grabs her by the shoulder and diverts her into the coffin. she closes the stone lid on the two of them. willow comes running in as ampata starts to leave. she grabs willow by the neck and picks her up.
ampata: this won't hurt!
scene direction: willow begins to choke. ampata moves in to kiss her.
xander: let her go!
scene direction: xander calmly walks in
xander: if you're gonna kiss anybody, it should be me.
ampata: xander, we can be together.
scene direction: ampata looks at willow
ampata: just... just let me have this one.
xander: that's never gonna happen.

scene direction: she tries to kiss willow again, but xander jumps in to stop her.
xander: no!
scene direction: xander pulls willow away from her
xander: you want life? you're gonna have to take mine. can you do that?
scene direction: ampata looks into his eyes as she considers. her skin has mummified up to her neck.
ampata: yes!
scene direction: she grabs his neck and tries to pull him to her as he holds her away by her arms. buffy kicks at the lid of the coffin and gets it open. xander keeps holding ampata at bay and watches as she turns back into a mummy.
scene direction: buffy comes up behind ampata and pulls her off of xander. his grip on her arms is so tight that they are torn from their sockets. xander is freaked out and drops them. buffy looks at ampata's body and drops it, too. the head breaks off of the body as it hits the floor. buffy is grossed out. willow just stares at what's left, then looks at xander and comes over to him. she crouches down next to him, holding his arm and rubbing his shoulder. he looks up at her a moment, then back down at his hands. giles is out of the coffin now, and he and buffy collect them to go. giles looks back briefly as they leave the exhibit.

scene direction: xander exhales
xander: i'm really the fun-talking guy today, huh? sorry.
