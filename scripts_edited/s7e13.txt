scene direction: giles scurries into the living room, where buffy and dawn are sitting on the couch.
giles: are you sure you'll all be all right?
dawn: you'll only be gone for two days.
buffy: i think we've managed a bit longer than that.
giles: right.
scene direction: giles looks around nervously, stops
giles: oh, dawn, vi's left her notebook on the mantelpiece. would you mind running it out to the car?
scene direction: dawn stands, goes to the fireplace
dawn: sure.
giles: while you're at it, you smack her in the head with it and remind her not to leave it lying around.
scene direction: dawn walks out the front door with the notebook
dawn: on it.
scene direction: giles sits on coffee table in front of buffy
giles: i'm just a bit twitchy about leaving you alone again here while—while things are
scene direction: giles takes of glasses, wipes his brow
giles: in such a state of flux.
buffy: i know. but you should go. this trip is important for the girls to understand the source of their power, and to know how to use it right.
giles: do you think they appreciate the gravity of what we're undertaking? it's frightening, and it's difficult. and then, apparently, someone told them that the vision quest consists of me driving them to the desert, doing the hokey pokey until a spooky rasta-mama slayer arrives and speaks to them in riddles.
scene direction: giles looks at buffy
scene direction: buffy looks innocent
buffy: that's not exactly how i put it, i—
scene direction: buffy sees willow come down stairs and enter the room
buffy: hey, how's kennedy?
willow: still fluey. bummed about missing the field trip.
scene direction: willow to giles
willow: she says she wants you to meditate extra hard for her and to bring her back some smores.
scene direction: willow grins
giles: ah yes. smores. i'm going to end up singing campfire songs aren't i?
scene direction: giles stands
buffy: oh yeah.
scene direction: xander comes in the front door, followed by dawn
xander: giles, you might want to get out there.
giles: oh, god, what?
dawn: molly and rona are fighting over who gets to drive the first leg.
scene direction: buffy to giles
buffy: bet you wish you renewed that california state driver's license now, huh?
scene direction: anya comes in the front door
anya: rona won. you should probably let molly out of the trunk.
scene direction: anya car horn blows outside, anya walks to the kitchen with willow
anya: i never actually realized just how compact molly really is.
scene direction: giles sighs, to buffy
giles: please be safe while i'm away.
buffy: you too.
scene direction: cut to 12 int. basement at buffy's house - day
scene direction: buffy walks downstairs to the basement, toward where spike is sitting on a cot, his wrists chained to the wall.
buffy: hey.
spike: hey.
buffy: giles is off ...on the retreat.
spike: give us all a chance for a breather, eh?
buffy: from giles?
spike: from the constant pitter patter of clomping teenage girly feet.
scene direction: buffy shrugs
buffy: i have no idea what you're talking about.
spike: come on.
buffy: no, i enjoy my responsibility as mentor, role model, life guide—oh, my god, i cannot believe i have my bathroom all to myself for two whole days.
scene direction: buffy sits on the cot beside spike
scene direction: spike leans forward
spike: it's like a bloody war-zone up there, and not in a good way.
buffy: have you seen the kitchen since they've been here?
spike: i'm just trying to stay out of their way.
scene direction: buffy glances at his chains
buffy: i noticed.
scene direction: spike looks at his chains
spike: this is better. believe me, it's safer.
buffy: ok. but you've been fine. in close contact with the girls.
scene direction: spike looks at buffy
spike: with you by my side, yeah. you won't let me hurt one of them. and that's the way it's gonna be until we're sure the first is done making me its bitch. either we're together, or i'm on the leash.
buffy: we just need to make sure the trigger's deactivated then. we've got a couple of days, lack of pitter-patter and all...
scene direction: spike leans forward, looking at her earnestly
spike: buffy...
buffy: what?
spike: ow.
buffy: ow?
scene direction: spike his face contorts, twitching
spike: ow ow ow!
scene direction: spike leans back, thrashes against the wall
buffy: what's wrong?
scene direction: buffy spike puts his hands to his head
buffy: spike, what is going on?
scene direction: spike calmer now
spike: the chip. god. why would—?
scene direction: spike screams
spike: aaahhh!
scene direction: spike holds his hands to his head, writhing in intense pain

scene direction: a tea kettle whistles as buffy walks into the kitchen from the basement. willow's at the stove.
willow: hey. how is he?
scene direction: buffy sits
buffy: oh, in the "goes" part of "comes and goes."
willow: well there seems to be a definite lack of screaming. that has to be good.
buffy: you'd think.
scene direction: buffy willow pours hot water into a cup
buffy: that for the other patient?
willow: yeah. thought i'd bring her some tea, help her feel better.
scene direction: buffy smiling, teasingly
buffy: mm-hmm?
willow: it's just tea.
scene direction: buffy giggles, then pauses
buffy: will, how much do you know about the chip?
willow: spike's chip? well, i remember trying to dig up stuff back then, but, you know, turns out, when a secret government agency studies vampires and puts chips in their brains that keep them from hurting people, they don't really build websites. why?
buffy: even with the chip, spike was able to hurt all those people when he was brainwashed.
willow: yeah, but he was under the control of the first.
buffy: maybe something's wrong with it.
willow: the chip is misfiring all on its own, then. well this'll be fun.
buffy: remember when things used to be nice and boring?
scene direction: willow shrugs
willow: no.
scene direction: willow walks out of the kitchen with tea in hand
scene direction: buffy teasingly, calls after her
buffy: have fun...delivering tea...
scene direction: willow stops, turns around
willow: ok, not when you make it sound all dirty like that.
scene direction: willow mumbles as she heads upstairs
willow: it's just tea.
scene direction: cut to 14 int. willow's room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: willow walks into her room to find kennedy putting on her shoes.
willow: hey, i figured the best thing for a cold is a nice hot cup of..
scene direction: willow frowns
willow: boots?
kennedy: hey.
willow: for someone who's sick, you look surprisingly robust and casual dressy.
kennedy: well, the lighting in here is good. maybe it's just—
scene direction: willow shocked
willow: you were never sick!
kennedy: no...i was never sick.
willow: oh, you are so busted. xander's gonna have to drive you to the desert and—
kennedy: willow, chill.
scene direction: kennedy stands
kennedy: there's a reason i didn't go. i have a thing. a separate thing.
willow: what?
scene direction: kennedy puts on her coat
kennedy: something's coming down. i have my own mission. and i need you help.
scene direction: cut to 15 int. the bronze night club - night
scene direction: a band's playing a song on stage.
scene direction: band singing
band: so i can be happy again...
scene direction: kennedy and willow are having a drink (complete with orange wedge and paper umbrella garnishes), sitting at one of the tables, listening to the band.
willow: this is a mission?
kennedy: oh! yeah...
willow: and the little pink umbrellas are a signal for what? we're not on a mission, are we?
kennedy: hey, trust me, i told you. i have a thing.
scene direction: kennedy willow gets up to leave, kennedy calls after her
kennedy: come on, come on. just hang out with me a little.
scene direction: kennedy willow turns to face her, sighing
kennedy: you're sexy when you pout.
willow: why do you do that?
scene direction: kennedy pouts
kennedy: to get you to stay.
scene direction: willow returns to the table, sits
willow: all right, i'll stay for one drink, then i'm going home.
kennedy: ok. one drink. i can work with that. let's start with the easy stuff. how long have you known? that you're gay.
willow: wait. that's easy?
scene direction: willow fidgets
willow: and you just assume that i'm—i'm gay. i mean, presume much?
scene direction: kennedy grins
kennedy: ok. how long have you enjoyed having sex with women?
scene direction: willow taken aback
willow: hey!
scene direction: willow kennedy chuckles
willow: what you think you have some special lesbidar or something?
kennedy: ok, you know there's a better word for that, right?
scene direction: kennedy willow sips her drink
kennedy: you really haven't been getting out there much, have you?
willow: well, i just—can you always tell just—just by looking at someone?
kennedy: no. no, of course not. that wouldn't be any fun. the fun part is the process of—of getting to know a girl. it's like—it's like flirting in code. it's using body language and laughing at the right jokes and—and looking into her eyes and knowing she's still whispering to you, even when she's not saying a word. and that sense that if you can just touch her just once everything will be ok for both of you. that's how you can tell.
scene direction: kennedy sits back, grins
kennedy: or if she's really hot, you just get her drunk—see if she comes on to you.
willow: three years ago. that's when i knew. and it wasn't women, it was woman. just one.
kennedy: lucky woman.
scene direction: kennedy smiles
scene direction: cut to 16 int. basement at buffy's house - night
scene direction: spike's lying on the cot on his back, resting his head on a pillow. his nose is bleeding. buffy sits by him.
spike: popped another blood vessel, i think.
scene direction: spike buffy hands him a towel; he wipes blood from his nose
buffy: there's gotta be a reason why the chip is going all wonky. maybe it's related to the trigger or maybe it has something to do with the new soul.
spike: or maybe i wasn't meant to last this long.
scene direction: spike beat
spike: one more thing you and i have in common, eh, pet?
buffy: well, we'll fix it. we'll hit serious research mode—
spike: good. try behavioral modification software throughout the ages.
scene direction: buffy sighs
buffy: ok. you're right. not a book thing. it's a phone thing.
spike: who you gonna call?
scene direction: spike buffy looks at him funny
spike: god, that phrase is never gonna be useable again, is it?
buffy: doubt it.
scene direction: cut to 17 int. the bronze night club - night
scene direction: kennedy and willow are having a drink together, talking.
kennedy: do your parents know?
willow: yeah. my mom was—was all proud like i was making some political statement. then the statement mojo wore off and i was just gay. she hardly ever even met tara.
kennedy: classic.
willow: i didn't mind. tara and i are kind of private.
kennedy: i'm sorry. it must've—
willow: were, i mean. private.
scene direction: cut to 18 int. living room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: buffy's talking on the phone while spike sits on the stairs behind her.
buffy: yes, agent finn, riley. tell him we're having a problem with spike's chip. no his chip. spike.
scene direction: spike shakes his head
spike: listen, pet?
buffy: no, no, finn is his last name. yeah. well, did he used to work there and then he got transferred?
scene direction: buffy spike's chip goes off again, he thrashes on the stairs unnoticed by buffy
buffy: oh, is this actually a flower shop, or is this one of those things where i'm supposed to play along to show that i know it's really secret ops? oh, maybe i shouldn't have said that. oh, ok, right. well, if some guy named finn shows up to buy flowers— yeah. thanks.
scene direction: buffy hangs up, turns to spike
buffy: wrong number. or a giant government conspiracy, one or the—
scene direction: buffy notices he's recovering from an episode
buffy: spike?
spike: this one seemed easier than the others. see? probably just gonna fade—
scene direction: spike screams, holding his head again
scene direction: cut to 19 int. the bronze night club - night
scene direction: kennedy and willow are having a drink together, talking.
kennedy: it was gone with the wind. i saw that, and i knew i wanted to sweep scarlet off her feet.
willow: you were five.
kennedy: well, i'm not saying the sweeping would have been easy...
scene direction: kennedy smiles, eats the cherry off her paper umbrella garnish
kennedy: what?
willow: i just—i still don't get it.
scene direction: willow shrugs
willow: why you like me. i mean, you don't even know me.
kennedy: have you seen you?
scene direction: kennedy willow blushes
kennedy: and we like the same things—italian, skate punk, robert parker mysteries, fighting evil...
scene direction: willow smiles, shakes her head
willow: i don't like any of that stuff. except the—the fighting evil part. even then, i prefer a nice foot massage.
kennedy: ok, i dig the way you always turn off the moulin rouge dvd at chapter 32 so it has a happy ending.
scene direction: kennedy willow laughs
kennedy: i like the way you speak. it's interesting.
scene direction: kennedy willow smiles
kennedy: and your freckles...likeable.
scene direction: kennedy willow blushes
kennedy: i'm not so into the magic stuff. it seems like fairy tale crap to me, but if it matters to you... you care about it, so it's cool.

scene direction: willow walks into her bedroom, kennedy waits at the door. the mood is very awkward.

scene direction: willow nods
willow: yeah, totally. air cleared. check.
scene direction: kennedy standing in front of willow now
kennedy: you know, in the spirit of air clearing...
willow: yeah?
kennedy: i feel like i need to be honest about something.
willow: i-is something wrong?
kennedy: no.
scene direction: kennedy shakes head
kennedy: no, it's just—
scene direction: kennedy walks closer to willow
kennedy: i think
scene direction: kennedy leans in for a kiss
kennedy: you should know...
scene direction: kennedy kisses willow slowly, passionately. the camera circles them as they kiss, showing willow's hair, then kennedy's hair—then willow's hair is gone as the kiss ends. where willow was, warren's now standing.
warren: well, that was nice.
scene direction: kennedy pulls back from him, panicked. she stumbles and falls as she retreats, knocking over a lamp.
scene change: fade to black.

scene direction: cut to 21 int. willow's room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: resume. willow's standing where warren was a moment ago, talking to kennedy, who is staring incredulously at her.
willow: are you ok?
scene direction: willow chuckles nervously
willow: i'm not used to literally knocking girls off of their feet with just the power of my own lips.
scene direction: kennedy just stares at willow, confused.
warren: ok, you gonna pick that up, or...?
kennedy: i don't—what are you?
willow: is this a freckle thing, 'cause—
scene direction: willow starts to panic and goes to look in the mirror; she sees warren's reflection instead of her own.
scene direction: willow [warren] = shown as warren
scene direction: willow = shown as willow
willow [warren]: oh, god! oh, god...
kennedy: what... is that?
scene direction: willow [warren] feeling his face

scene direction: cut to 22 int. living room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: warren comes down the stairs, followed by kennedy. xander, anya and dawn are in the living room.
kennedy: ok, hold up a sec.
scene direction: when xander, anya and dawn see warren, they gasp and stand, positioning themselves defensively.
willow [warren]: guys—
xander: get buffy. get buffy. tell her the first is back.
willow [warren]: no, i'm not the first.
anya: we're not interested in any of your evil lies. we've heard 'em all.
willow: no, guys it's me.
willow [warren]: i'm me. i'm willow. guys, come on. as kennedy—
scene direction: willow [warren] points to kennedy
willow [warren]: she was there.
scene direction: kennedy shakes her head
kennedy: i don't know. i'm not sure. we were up in willow's room and we were—-
scene direction: carrying a bowl of food, andrew walks into the living room. when he sees warren, he freezes in place, dropping his bowl; it shatters to pieces on the ground.
andrew: no... no. you're back.
scene direction: willow [warren] emphatic
willow [warren]: no, i'm not. it's not— i'm not it. listen to me—
andrew: no more listening. i know who you are now. i know what you made me do. your promises of happy fields and dancing schnauzers and being demigods won't work on me anymore.
scene direction: anya yells
anya: buffy!
scene direction: xander whispers, to anya
xander: the bringers are coming too.
willow [warren]: no, i'm not the first.

willow [warren]: i'm not the first.
scene direction: buffy walks into the room
buffy: what the hell is going on here—?
scene direction: buffy scowls when she sees warren, punches him in the nose. he falls to the ground, writhing in pain on the floor
buffy: ow!
scene direction: buffy stares at warren
scene direction: spike walks into the room, holding his head

scene direction: willow grabs andrew's hands
willow: hey,
scene direction: willow turns to face him
willow: bad touching!
scene direction: spike wanders around, holding his head, moaning in pain while everyone stares at willow/warren.
willow [warren]: everyone please stop it.
kennedy: it's willow.
willow [warren]: i'm willow.
xander: are you sure?
willow: there are other stories from kindergarten. non yellow crayon stories in which you don't come out in such a good light.
willow [warren]: an incident involving aquaman underoos, for example. you want me to start talking?
scene direction: xander smiles, walks up to willow/warren
xander: hey, willow!
anya: what happened?
scene direction: everyone inches closer to willow/warren.
willow [warren]: i don't know. we were there, and then i looked like him.
anya: oh, like a glamour.
willow [warren]: maybe, but i probably brought it on myself.
buffy: what makes you think that?
willow [warren]: well, it wouldn't be the first time. i have a history with my witchy subconscious making things go kerfloopey. remember the wacky "i can't see you, you can't see me" spell?
scene direction: while willow/warren's talking, dawn touches his shoulder, andrew touches his chest and face.
scene direction: buffy to dawn and andrew
buffy: guys!
scene direction: andrew stops touching willow/warren
andrew: it's so real.
willow [warren]: i'm all too aware.
scene direction: willow [warren] brushes dawn's hand away
buffy: ok, say you're right, and you did do this to yourself. why would your subconscious turn you into warren?
willow [warren]: obviously because i feel bad—about killing him.
buffy: we'll deal. we'll get help.
willow [warren]: no, i can handle this.
buffy: on your own? why?
willow [warren]: i did it. i'll fix it. i don't want you seeing me this way anyway.
scene direction: willow [warren] walks toward the door
buffy: it's kinda a little late for that.
scene direction: buffy spike's moaning in the background
willow [warren]: seriously, i'm not posing any big threat to the world. looks like you've got your hands full already.
scene direction: buffy looks around, sees spike lying on the floor moaning and twitching.
willow: i'll go, i'll handle it, i'll fix it, i'll be back before you even know i'm gone.
willow [warren]: promise.
scene direction: willow [warren] leaves through the front door
scene direction: buffy goes to his side
buffy: spike.
scene direction: buffy kneels down beside him
spike: buffy.
buffy: i'm right here.
spike: the chip fired again.
scene direction: xander, anya, dawn and andrew gather around to watch buffy and spike. kennedy sneaks out the front door unnoticed.

spike: maybe we can't wait.
scene direction: cut to 23 ext. random street in sunnydale - night
scene direction: willow/warren's walking purposefully down the street. kennedy walks up to her, surprising her.
kennedy: ok. safe to say no one will ever accuse you of being too butch.
willow [warren]: kennedy, go home.
scene direction: willow [warren] walks away
scene direction: kennedy follows
kennedy: come on. i mean, you turned into a guy. i mean if you take a step back, seriously, there's a certain element of humor here, right?
scene direction: kennedy willow/warren stops walking, turns and glares at her
kennedy: well, a really, really big step.
willow [warren]: i killed him. it's hard to see the chuckles.
scene direction: willow [warren] walks away
scene direction: kennedy follows
kennedy: so you got a plan?
willow: yeah, get some help reversing it.
kennedy: i thought you were gonna try it yourself.
willow: i did try. something's blocking me.
kennedy: all the more reason for me to go with you. plus, i was there when it happened. lemme come to try to help too.
scene direction: willow [warren] stops walking
willow [warren]: i really think i'm fine with the handling.
kennedy: by yourself? why?
willow: i'm the one that killed him. i— it's hard to understand.
kennedy: given. how 'bout i just tag along anyway. keep you company.
scene direction: kennedy willow/warren sighs
kennedy: i'm taking that as a yes.
scene direction: willow [warren] walks
willow [warren]: fine. come.
willow: try not to get in the way.

scene direction: spike stops walking
spike: here we are.
scene direction: yep, here we are. (they kneel on the ground) you think the stuff's still good?
spike: i don't know.
scene direction: spike digs through the dirt
spike: worked pretty good when the initiative held me captive here. every time i'd get a little...rambunctious, the chip'd kick in. i feel like my head was gonna explode. they'd dope me up, and everything would be all daffodils and teddy bears. for a couple of hours anyway.
buffy: maybe we should search for files and stuff. find out everything we can about the chip—shelf life.
spike: i'll take whatever i can get.
scene direction: spike grabs a chain in the dirt
scene direction: buffy grabs the chain spike's holding
buffy: ready?
spike: yeah.

andrew: i'll get it.
scene direction: andrew stands
andrew: i'm supposed to get a call when the new league of extraordinary gentlemen comes in. i gave them this number.
xander: ooh. can you see if you can get two?
andrew: summers residence, this is andrew speaking. how can i help you?
scene direction: xander realizes that dawn and anya are staring at him, looks at andrew
xander: loser.
scene direction: andrew holds his hand over the phone
andrew: hey, do we know some british guy named robson?
scene direction: time passes. xander hangs up the phone and reports to dawn and anya.
xander: he was attacked, this robson guy in england.
scene direction: xander sits
xander: and giles was there helping him. and there was a bringer.
scene direction: anya leans forward
anya: xander...
xander: robson blacked out, but the last thing he remembers is giles's head about to get really familiar with a bringer's very sharp axe.
dawn: oh, my god!
anya: giles never mentioned any of this.
xander: robson said by the time he came to, there was no giles.
dawn: so, what are we saying?
xander: maybe giles just didn't want to talk about it.
anya: or maybe he didn't make it. look, i'm not saying it's a happy scenario, but we're dealing with a big bad that can be any dead person it wants.
xander: because if you want to infiltrate the inner circle of the slayer...
anya: become the one person she trusts more than anybody else.
dawn: but there's no way that we can know.
andrew: actually that's not true. the first can't take corporeal form, so it can't touch anything.
anya: oh, it's not like giles hasn't touched anything, right?
scene direction: anya thinks, looks expectantly at everyone else
anya: ha-has anyone seen giles touch anything since he got back? hold anything? has anybody hugged him? think very hard.
scene direction: xander stands and walks toward the door. anya and dawn follow.
scene direction: andrew stands, follows them toward the door
andrew: wait—where're you...?
xander: the desert. we're gonna find giles.
andrew: oh good. let me just get some tapes for the car. i've been working on this mix—
xander: you're not coming.
andrew: what? why? 'cause i used to be evil?
xander: no, actually, 'cause you're annoying, but that's a good reason too.
scene direction: xander turns toward the door
scene direction: andrew panicked
andrew: wait, i—don't leave me here alone. i keep getting attacked in this house.
dawn: actually, xand...
andrew: what if this is all part of the plan? drive you guys away so it can have its way with me? ever think of that?
xander: i'll risk it.
scene direction: xander puts his hand on the doorknob
andrew: ok, well, if you leave me here alone, i'll do something evil, like burning something or gluing things together.
anya: for crying out loud, harris, let's just take him. at least we can keep an eye on him.
scene direction: anya xander waves to andrew to join them; andrew and dawn go out the door
