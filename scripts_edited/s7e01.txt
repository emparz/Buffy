buffy: it's about power.
scene direction: pan to buffy talking to someone.
buffy: who's got it. who knows how to use it. so...
scene direction: tosses a stake to dawn.
buffy: who's got the power, dawn?
scene direction: dawn sighs
dawn: well, i've got the stake.
buffy: the stake is not the power.
dawn: but he's new. he doesn't know his strength. h-he might not know all those fancy martial arts skills they inevitably seem to pick up.
buffy: who's got the power?
dawn: he does.
buffy: never forget it. doesn't matter how well prepped you are or how well armed you are. you're a little girl.
dawn: woman.
buffy: little woman.
dawn: i'm taller than you.
buffy: he's a vampire, ok? demon. preternaturally strong. skilled with powers no human could possibly ever—
vampire: excuse me. i think i'm stuck.
buffy: you're stuck?
vampire: my foot's caught on a root or something, and... i don't even know how i got down there. if you girls could just give me a hand...
dawn: hm. so, he's got the power?
buffy: zip it.
vampire: i really appreciate it. it's just it's so dark, and i don't even know what i'm doing here.
scene direction: buffy picks him up by his suit collar and puts him down standing on his feet.
vampire: whoa. ooh. thanks. that was a help. unfortunately it was the last—
scene direction: buffy grabs him by the throat. his voice turns scratchy.
vampire: —thing you'll ever do.
buffy: listen up. i'm the slayer. you don't want to get into it with me. you want blood? you can have hers.
scene direction: vampire turns to go after dawn.
buffy: power. he's got it. he's going to use it. you don't have it, so —
scene direction: vampire is charging dawn. she bends and flips him over her back.
buffy: —use that. perfect.
scene direction: dawn stakes him, and thinks she defeated him. but she missed the heart. she gets a panicked look on her face. he pushes dawn down, gets up and away from her. she tries again to stake him, but he overpowers her and starts to bite her neck.
dawn: buffy!
scene direction: buffy grabs the vampire's coat from behind, and he drops dawn. buffy fights with swings, kicks, punches, etc. finally, she grabs a nearby sword, and cuts off his head.
buffy: it's real. it's the only lesson, dawn. it's always real. let me see.
scene direction: she inspects dawn's neck. there are two puncture wounds where the vampire bit her.
dawn: it's nothing, it's just a scrape. plus, i had a plan the whole time.
buffy: really?
dawn: yeah, i planned to get killed, come back as a vampire, and bite you.
buffy: you wanted to be trained.
dawn: well, just the next time when you're gonna disa—
buffy: you did pretty well.
dawn: i did?
buffy: yeah.
dawn: 'cause, you know, with the whole rolling thing, i was actually using his strength, and it was very tai chi. plus i nearly got the heart.
buffy: my first time out, i missed the heart too.
dawn: no way.
buffy: just the once.
scene direction: buffy walks back to pack up her tools and weapons. they begin walking home.
dawn: well, the next vampire i meet—
buffy: the next vampire you meet, you run away. i just wish that was all we had to worry about. vampires, demons... they're nothing compared to what's coming.
dawn: i know. i just can't believe it's back.
buffy: believe me, i thought i was long past it. i guess you never are. just a few more days 'til it starts. then we'll never know what's coming next.

giles: that doesn't belong there.
willow: no, it doesn't.
giles: that's the flora kua alaya. a native of paraguay, if my botany serves.
willow: is there anything you don't know everything about?
giles: synchronized swimming. complete mystery to me.
scene direction: moves closer.
giles: yep. paraguay. where does it come from?
willow: paraguay.
giles: who brought it through the earth?
willow: it's all connected. the root systems, the molecules...the energy. everything's connected.
giles: you sound like miss hartness.
willow: she's taught me a lot.
giles: then why aren't you in your lesson?
willow: sorry.
giles: it's alright. she was just—
willow: —afraid. yeah, they all are. the coven is—they're the most amazing women i've ever met. but there's this look that they get. like i'm gonna turn them all into bangers and mash, or something. which i'm not even really sure what that is.
giles: they're cautious. i trust you understand that.
willow: i don't have that much power, i don't think.
giles: everything's connected. you're connected to a great power, whether you feel it or not.
willow: well you should just take it from me.
scene direction: she gets up and storms off, angry at herself. they walk toward a building.
giles: you know we can't. this isn't a hobby or an addiction. it's inside you now, this magic. you're responsible for it.
willow: will they always be afraid of me?
giles: maybe. can you handle it?
willow: i deserve a lot worse. i killed people, giles.
scene direction: they stop and look at each other.
giles: i've not forgotten.
willow: when you brought me here, i thought it was to kill me or to lock me in some mystical dungeon for all eternity or—with the torture. instead, you go all dumbledore on me. i'm learning about magic. all about energy and gaia and root systems.
giles: do you want to be punished?
willow: i wanna be willow.
giles: you are. in the end, we all are who we are, no matter how much we may appear to have changed.

buffy: my sister's about to go to the same high school that tried to kill me for three years. i can't change districts, i can't afford private school, and i can't begin to prepare for what could possibly come out of there. so, peachy with a side of keen, that would be me.
xander: well here's a little something for what ails ya.
scene direction: xander gestures with the tube of papers he brought in.
buffy: mmm. you got the rest.
scene direction: xander goes into the dining room. buffy follows. he lays out the plans for the high school.
xander: take a look.

buffy: go. talk with your mouth full.
xander: i've got two crews working on this diabolical yet lucrative new campus. one here finishing the science building. and one here, reinforcing the gym. there are no pentagrams, no secret passageways. everything's up to code and safe as houses.
buffy: nothing creepy? strange? from beyond?
scene direction: dawn with her mouth full
dawn: maybe you're just paranoid.
xander: well, there is one interesting detail. i managed to scare up the plan from the old high school. you remember the very center of sunnydale's own hell mouth?
scene direction: xander puts up new and old plans to the window so they can see through them.
buffy: under the library.
xander: right. so i lined up the plans, new and old. and right exactly where the library was, we now have...
buffy: principal's office.
dawn: so the principal's evil?
buffy: or in a boatload of danger.

buffy: guess we'll see. ooh, we have to leave though. you have everything? books, lunch, stakes?
dawn: checked thrice.

dawn: i got it
buffy: and stay away from hyena people, or any lizard-type athletes, you know, or if you see anyone that's invisible.
dawn: hey, buffy, i think it's pretty safe to say i'm not going to see anybody that's invisible.
buffy: you know, you could still drop out. only nerds finish high school.
dawn: you know, i don't really think it's fair for you to try and scare me on my first day of high school. 'cause it is so redundant.
buffy: the place is evil.

anya: but...who?
halfrek: listen, anya. i know i've always been a little competitive with you. i mean, there was that thing in the crimean war. we laugh about it now. but the fact is, i've actually always looked up to you. you were the single-most hard-core vengeance demon on the roster, and everybody knew it. do i have to mention mrs. cholgash?
anya: hmm. ha. good times.
halfrek: and then you lost your powers. it happens, and you fell for this xander guy.
anya: it was a glitch. a summer thing. i am so back in the vengeance fold.
halfrek: no deaths. no eviscerations. you're not goading women into anything inventive, and you're not delivering when it is.
anya: i don't even know—
halfrek: waitress downtown wished her husband was a frog? you made him french.
anya: hmph, he's smelly and with a little mustache. she—

buffy: they talked about protecting people. told me to leave.
xander: no damage, though.

scene direction: she hangs up the phone.
buffy: where's my sister?
dead janitor: i think she's lost.
buffy: if i'm the one who let you die, why take it out on her? i'm right here. c'mon, what're you after? fear? revenge? tasty brains?
dead nerd: i think i'd like dawn to be my girlfriend.
buffy: again, wrong sister. i'm the one that dates dead guys. and, no offense, but they were hotties. i mean, i'm sure you had a great personality, but...

dead janitor: she's not gonna hear you. this place is like a maze.
dead girl: this place is ours now. it was built on our graves.
dead janitor: all we want is for you to leave so we can rest again.
buffy: actually, i'm thinking all you want is to get between me and that door. who's for finding out why.
scene direction: dead nerd lunges at buffy, who pushes him out of the way. then dead girl jumps on her back, and buffy falls back to the ground to knock her off. when buffy gets up, she thought she had taken them all out, but suddenly all three dead people are standing in front of the door again, like they reappeared there supernaturally.
buffy: if at first you don't succeed...

buffy: ... cheat!
scene direction: they jump her again. she fights them off and goes for the door.
buffy: dawnie, we have to get o—
scene direction: when she opens the door, much to her surprise, it's not dawn behind the door after all. she's staring into the face of a longer-haired spike. he looks grim, and not the least bit happy to see her. buffy is astonished.
scene change: fade to black.
scene change: *** act iv ***
scene direction: cut to 31 int. basement sunnydale high - day
scene direction: resume.
buffy: spike? are you real?
scene direction: spike laughs and looks funny at her. he stops laughing, and touches his hand tenderly to her face.
spike: buffy, duck.
buffy: what? duck? there's a duck?
scene direction: from behind, the dead janitor hits her over the head with a pipe.
spike: no visitors today. terribly busy.
scene direction: the dead janitor starts beating on buffy with the pipe.
dead nerd: told you to get out.
scene direction: buffy trips the dead janitor, making him fall to the floor. she jumps up and uses the door where she found spike to hit the dead janitor's head. then she goes into the room and latches the door behind her.
buffy: he'll probably show up in a sec.
spike: nobody comes in here. it's just the three of us.
buffy: spike, have you seen dawn? she came down here with some kids.
scene direction: spike yelling
spike: don't you think i'm trying? i'm not fast. i'm not a quick study.
scene direction: spike suddenly crying
spike: i dropped my board in the water and the chalk all ran. sure to be caned.
scene direction: spike laughs
spike: should've seen that coming.
scene direction: he moves away from buffy into a corner, but she follows. his unbuttoned shirt was loose, but he covered his chest with it, crossed his arms, and leaned his back against the wall. she reaches for his shirt to see what he was hiding. he looks away. there are numerous deep gashes on the upper left side of his chest, like he has been clawed.
buffy: what did you do?
spike: i tried... i... tried to cut it out.
scene direction: buffy doesn't understand what's going on with spike. he's clearly acting strange, but her cell phone rings before she can figure it out. she turns away from him to answer it.
buffy: dawn?
dawn: buffy, where are you?
buffy: i...: buffy is distracted by spike's barely audible mumbling. he has crouched down on the floor on his tiptoes.
buffy: look, where are you?
dawn: i don't know. in a room by the furnace. near where we fell in. they dragged us in here, and then they disappeared.
buffy: yeah, they came after me too.
dawn: well, what do they want?
buffy: so far, to piss me off.
dawn: please, tell me it's working.
buffy: oh, i'm damage-bound. i just can't figure them. ghosts can't touch you and zombies can't disappear, so i don't know what—
spike: not ghosts.
dawn: who was that?
scene direction: buffy to the phone
buffy: hold on.
scene direction: buffy to spike
buffy: you know what they are?
spike: manifest spirits controlled by a talisman, raised to seek vengeance. a 4-year-old could figure it.
scene direction: buffy to the phone
buffy: hang tight. i'll find you. these things can hurt you. you can hurt them too. find a weapon. i'll come for you.
scene direction: buffy to spike
buffy: spike, you gonna help me out?
spike: this is my home. i belong here. always been here. cheers for stopping by.
scene direction: spike walks away from buffy. he faces the wall and puts his hands on it.
scene direction: spike to himself
spike: it's in the wall.
scene direction: spike turns away from her to put his hands on the wall. he starts to moan softly.
buffy: i'll get back to you.
scene direction: she kicks down the door and leaves the room.
buffy: guys? resentful dead guys? this can't be good. come on, manifest spirits, raised up, controlled by a... talisman.
scene direction: buffy makes a call on her cell phone.
buffy: xander...
scene direction: cut to 32 int. basement sunnydale high - day
scene direction: dawn, kit, and carlos are in a different area of the basement than buffy.
dawn: we need to find some kind of weapon just to hold them off.
scene direction: carlos finds some bricks on a nearby utility shelf.
carlos: i got these.
dawn: kit, gimme your bag.
scene direction: dawn empties the contents of kit's purse on the floor and replaces them with the bricks. buffy is still looking for them in the basement.
kit: do you think they're gonna come back?
dead girl: think they're gonna come back? we never left. we'll always be here. just like you.
kit: no.
dead girl: why do you think we picked you? the ones no one will miss. the ones that don't belong. you spend all your time trying to get out of high school, and now you'll never ever leave.
scene direction: dawn swings the brick-bag at the dead girl's knees and knocks her down. the dead janitor knocks dawn back with a punch to the face. dawn shrieks. buffy hears her and runs toward the scream.
scene direction: cut to 33 int. restroom sunnydale high - day
scene direction: xander enters the restroom and sees the floor has fallen in.
xander: whoa. contracty goodness. talisman, talisman.
scene direction: he edges himself around the hole in the floor to move toward the mirrors and sinks.
scene direction: cut to 34 int. basement sunnydale high - day
scene direction: the dead people are still fighting dawn and friends. the dead janitor attacks dawn, who screams.
dead janitor: you can thank your sister for this.
scene direction: buffy enters the room, and the dead nerd comes at her with a pipe. she pushes him away and kicks the dead janitor away from dawn.
dawn: thanks, sis.
buffy: we just need to keep them at bay.
scene direction: the dead people keep attacking buffy and dawn.
dawn: the bag!
scene direction: buffy kicks butt with the brick-bag and her karate kicks.
scene direction: cut to 35 int. restroom sunnydale high - day
scene direction: xander is looking around on the floor of the restroom and finds the feather/crystal/twig talisman right where buffy dropped it earlier.
xander: yes! talisman.
scene direction: dead girl jumps on his back and attacks him.
scene direction: cut to 36 int. basement sunnydale high - day
scene direction: buffy is still fighting the dead people. dawn throws buffy a metal pipe.
buffy: do you really want to keep this up?
dead janitor: what're you going to do, kill us?
scene direction: cut to 37 int. restroom sunnydale high - day
scene direction: still fighting off the dead girl, xander breaks the talisman in half, and the dead people vanish.
scene direction: cut to 38 int. basement sunnydale high - day
scene direction: after the dead people vanish in front of their eyes, the kids have a look of awe on their faces.
carlos: are they gone?
buffy: yeah. the talisman must have been destroyed.
dawn: how'd you know it was a talisman?
buffy: there's always a talisman. the real question is who put it there. c'mon, you guys, let's go find a way upstairs, assuming there is one.
dawn: you really weren't kidding about this place. i guess it hasn't changed.
buffy: i don't know. seems smaller.
scene direction: cut to 39 int. hallway at sunnydale high- day
scene direction: buffy is standing in the hallway, talking to dawn, kit, and carlos.
buffy: you guys are gonna be ok. school is intense, but you'll do all right as long as you're careful. and you might want to think about sticking together.
kit: thank you.
scene direction: kit hugs buffy.
carlos: yeah, i mean it. you are the coolest mom ever.
scene direction: buffy looks self-conscious and plays with her hair. dawn saves her from further embarrassment by ushering her friends away.
dawn: ok. come on, we still have a few more classes to live through.
scene direction: dawn kisses buffy on the cheek, and walks away with her friends. the principal walks up to buffy.
principal: curiouser and curiouser.
buffy: what is?
principal: carlos trejo and kit holburn, right? possibly the only two students in this school whose files are as thick as yours was.
buffy: you really did your homework, didn't you?
principal: i was looking for one or both of them to actually implode in a fearsome way right before midterms. and now i see that you got 'em socializing and hugging and actually, if i'm not mistaken, headed to class.
buffy: well, we shared an... encounter.
principal: look, i know you're probably more than happy to get out of this place. but i gotta tell you, miss summers, i think you belong here.
buffy: hmm, new?
principal: listen, i know this school's reputation. what, you think i got this job based on seniority? we got a lot of troubled students here, and just enough money to keep this place from caving in.
buffy: yeah, you might need a little extra there.
principal: well, we do have a community outreach program. and the money we could pay you... wouldn't even fold. but it would just be a couple of days a week.
buffy: are you asking me to be a counselor?
principal: well, we have a guidance counselor, but i was thinking the kids could use someone, you know, closer to their age who still—
buffy: i'm in!
principal: what, you serious? you—you did hear the part about the money, right?
buffy: yeah, i heard. my schedule might be a little funtastic, but, uh, i'll work it out. i'd like to keep an eye on this place.
principal: well, that's great. look at that. it's not even noon, and i've already bullied my first family member into helping out. i'm going to be the best principal ever.
scene direction: principal walks away. buffy looks pleased like maybe things will work out after all.
scene direction: cut to 40 int. basement sunnydale high - day
scene direction: back in the room where spike was. he's still crouched down on the floor on his tiptoes, hugging his knees. he looks vulnerable, like he's in there with someone or something dangerous.
spike: the thing is...i had a speech. i learned it all. oh, god. she won't understand, she won't understand.
scene direction: warren is circling spike, addressing him as spike cowers in the middle of the room.
first [warren]: of course she won't understand, sparky. i'm beyond her understanding. she's a girl. sugar and spice and everything...useless unless you're baking. i'm more than that. more than flesh...
scene direction: warren morphs into glory, who is still pacing and talking to spike.
first [glory]: ...more than blood. i'm... you know, i honestly don't think there's a human word fabulous enough for me. oh, my name will be on everyone's lips, assuming their lips haven't been torn off. but not just yet. that's alright, though...
scene direction: glory morphs into adam. apparently this monster is something that can change shape and impersonate other characters. the morphing monster is still pacing.
first [adam]: ...i can be patient. everything is well within parameters. she's exactly where i want her to be. and so are you, number 17. you're right where you belong.
scene direction: morphing monster changes to the mayor and bends down on one knee to talk to spike at eye-level.
first [the mayor]: so what'd you think? you'd get your soul back and everything'd be jim dandy? soul's slipperier than a greased weasel. why do you think i sold mine?
scene direction: first [the mayor] laughs
first [the mayor]: well, you probably thought that you'd be your own man, and i respect that, but...
scene direction: first [drusilla] touching spike's face
first [drusilla]: ...you never will. you'll always be mine. you'll always be in the dark with me, singing our little songs. you like our little songs, don't you? you've always liked them, right from the beginning. and that's where we're going...
scene direction: first [the master] stands
first [the master]: ...right back to the beginning. not the bang... not the word... the true beginning. the next few months are going to be quite a ride. and i think we're all going to learn something about ourselves in the process. you'll learn you're a pathetic schmuck, if it hasn't sunk in already. look at you. trying to do what's right, just like her. you still don't get it. it's not about right, not about wrong...
scene direction: morphing monster walks around behind spike, and when it reappears, it has transformed into buffy. as buffy, it is standing with arms crossed in front, with a smug and serious look on her face, glaring at spike.
first [buffy]: ...it's about power.
