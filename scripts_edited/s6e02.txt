xander: i'm pretty sure she's okay.
scene direction: xander gets up and goes to anya
xander: or as okay as someone who's just had snakes coming out of their mouth. what the hell was that all about, tara?
scene direction: xander tara looks up at him
anya: less talk, more running away.
xander: i'm sure the woods'll give us cover. their motorcycles can't follow us in here.
scene direction: the motorcycles noises get closer, and we see the light from their headlights.
anya: someone should tell them that.
xander: new plan.
scene direction: xander goes to willow, kneels and starts lifting her
xander: let's split up.
anya: no, bad plan.
scene direction: xander and tara have the unconscious willow upright, each supporting one side of her.
tara: i'll take her.
xander: no, i can carry her.
scene direction: xander tara looks anxious
xander: i'll keep her safe.
scene direction: tara nods reluctantly
tara: we should meet up somewhere.
xander: the magic box. whoever gets there first, call dawn and spike.
scene direction: tara and anya start off, but anya pauses.

scene direction: cut back to the grave. the bot is on the ground and the demons surround her, kicking her and yelling happily.
scene direction: pan down across buffy's headstone, to the grass.
scene change: cut to inside the coffin. buffy pounds frantically on the sides, tries to scream but no sound comes out. she looks terrified. she continues pounding, bangs on the inner lid just inches from her face. she begins to rip away the cloth that covers the inside of the lid. she grunts with exertion as the cloth rips.
scene change: cut to the forest. xander walks along carrying willow, moving at a fast walk. he pauses, puts her down on the ground. willow comes to again.
scene direction: willow loudly
willow: xan ... xander, where - where- xander: shh! we're using our quiet voice, will.
scene direction: willow whispers
willow: wh-wh-where's tara?
scene direction: xander panting
xander: off and running. like we need to be. we gotta keep moving.
scene direction: willow panting
willow: oh ... right. demons ... on bikes.
xander: yeah. we got trouble. right here in hellmouth city. and our very own robo-buffy led them right to us.
willow: buffy! the ritual! we have to go back.
scene direction: willow sits up
scene direction: xander pushes her back
xander: will. i told you.
willow: we have to try again.
xander: no, we can't.
willow: we have to, xander! i - she - she's waiting! she's counting on us, on, on me! i can't leave her there any more, i won't. we have to finish.
xander: shh!
scene direction: they both hush and look around nervously as a motorcycle goes by near them.
scene direction: xander whispers
xander: will .. .the urn of cirrhosis...
willow: osiris?
xander: yeah. it got kind of...
scene direction: willow remembers
willow: broken. it's broken. i remember.
xander: so we'll find another one. better made. anya and i will jump back on the web- willow: there is no other one.
scene direction: xander closes her eyes
xander: okay, we'll fix this one. a little tape, a dab of crazy glue.
willow: no. it's no use.
scene direction: willow tearful
willow: the urn's defiled. it's gone. nothing, it was all for nothing. buffy's gone. she's really gone.
scene direction: willow begins to cry, buries her face in xander's chest.
scene change: cut to buffy still ripping the cloth from the coffin. she bangs her hands against the lid, punches it and her fist goes through the wood. dirt begins to rain down on her as she pulls at the wood, widening the hole.
scene change: cut to anya running through the woods, looking around.
scene direction: mag os
mag: over here! stop your moanin'.
scene direction: anya suddenly falls down as tara pulls at her from behind a rock.
scene direction: anya annoyed
anya: was that really necessary? a simple "psst"- tara puts her hand over anya's mouth. they both fall silent as two demons walk up near them.
clyed: i'm just saying it's rank.
mag: get off it, clyed.
clyed: razor and the others head back to town, leave us here to hunt down strays. it's bullsh- mag: hey!
scene direction: clyed grabs clyed
clyed: you got a bug up your crack, you take it up with razor.
scene direction: the two girls huddle behind their rock listening.
mag: until then you do as he says, and shut your hole, before i rip you a new one.
scene direction: mag lets go of clyed and looks around, snarling.
mag: ah, screw this, let's get out of here.
scene direction: mag they both turn away
mag: let's go hit some stores.
scene direction: tara and anya relax a little as the demons move away.
tara: doesn't sound like they found willow and xander.
anya: did he say stores? hitting stores? does that mean looting?
tara: i think, i think the woods let out over this way
scene direction: tara points
tara: we should keep off the streets, take alleys if we can.
anya: they can't loot the magic shop, not now! i just got it.
scene direction: tara puts hand on anya's shoulder
tara: let's go.
scene direction: they get up and start to walk.
anya: you don't think they'll cause a lot of damage, do you?
scene change: cut to the demons still wrecking houses and cars on residential street. one demon throws a molotov cocktail at a front door, jumps up and down triumphantly as the porch bursts into flame.
scene direction: shot of a wooden mailbox labeled "summers." a demon rides past and smashes it with a baseball bat.

spike: ...holy water, one cross -
scene direction: spike reaches in to grab the cross
spike: ow!
scene direction: spike stumbles back, shaking his hand in pain
spike: brilliant.
scene direction: he looks at his injured hand, then over at the window, notices dawn.
spike: here!
scene direction: spike starts toward her
spike: you want me to bloody thump you? i told you to stay away from the window.
scene direction: spike pulls her away
dawn: who are they?
scene direction: spike peers out
spike: hellions. road pirates.
scene direction: spike shot of a demon throwing rocks through a house's windows
spike: they raid towns ... use 'em up, burn 'em down. it's usually backwaters, any place...
scene direction: spike looks back at dawn, realizing
spike: any place they think is vulnerable.
dawn: they know. the slayer's gone.
scene direction: spike looks back out the window. the demons continue to ride up and down the street, setting various things on fire.
spike: can't stay here.
scene direction: spike gets up, grabs dawn by the hand
dawn: w-well, i'm not going out there!
scene direction: spike pulling her toward the door
spike: got no choice, bit, i can't protect you here.
scene direction: dawn stops
dawn: well, we can lock the doors, turn out the lights.
spike: and what, hide under the bed linen? not really my style.
dawn: but we need to wait for the others, and buffy.
scene direction: spike frowns at her, confused.
dawn: ...bot. you know, the-the buffybot.
scene direction: spike sighs in frustration, looks around.
scene direction: dawn agitated
dawn: we-we have to wait for the others- spike:
scene direction: dawn grabs her roughly by the shoulders
dawn: look!
scene direction: dawn pauses, more quietly
dawn: dawn, i get that you're scared. but i'm your sitter, so mind me.
scene direction: dawn lets go her shoulders
dawn: i'm not gonna let any of those buggers lay so much as a warty digit on you. right?
scene direction: dawn whispers
dawn: right.
spike: right, then. we can't wait around to see if the others will pop in. we're on our own. no one's coming to our rescue.
scene direction: he takes dawn's hands and leads her toward the back door.
scene change: cut to buffy's grave. zoom in on the ground, which is already churned up from the motorcycles riding over it.
scene direction: suddenly a hand bursts out from below, then another hand, then buffy's head and shoulders. she gasps for air, pulls herself up onto the grass, lies there panting. she looks around at the dark forest, very fearfully.
scene change: *** act ii ***
scene direction: continuation from bargaining part 1... open on the same scene.
scene direction: buffy slowly gets to her feet, turns and stares at the headstone with her name on it. she frowns in confusion, then her eyes widen in shock as she gets it.
scene change: cut to downtown. a car sits there burning, half burnt away. buffy walks up, stares. pan to a wider shot and we see her walking down a street that's littered with debris. buffy wears a black dress with dark hose and black heeled shoes. her hair is shaggy and mostly covers her face.
scene change: cut to a shot from buffy's point of view. everything is blurry and indistinct. she continues walking, squinting and frowning at the burning cars.
scene direction: she stops walking to stare at a car. a demon on his motorcycle goes roaring past, throws something as he goes by. buffy watches him go, backs away.
scene change: cut to interior of the magic shop. the door opens and tara and anya run in. they go down the steps into the main room.
tara: willow, xander!
scene direction: tara goes to look in the back room, comes back. anya looks around the store.
tara: they're not here.
anya: thank god.
scene direction: anya tara looks confused

scene direction: loud banging noise from outside. they both turn to look.
tara: yet.
scene direction: they go to the window, peek out.
scene direction: shot of a bunch of demons looting a store across the street.
scene direction: anya softly
anya: xander.
tara: they're all right.
anya: then where are they? why aren't they here?
tara: i don't know.
scene direction: anya turns away from the window, walks into the store. tara follows.
scene direction: anya getting agitated
anya: they could be hurt. xander could be lying somewhere broken and bleeding, calling out my name.
tara: anya.
anya: like that, oh god!
scene direction: anya walks on
anya: what if, what if they're really hurt, what if they're dead?
scene direction: tara firmly
tara: they're not.
anya: how do you know?
tara: because he's with willow. and if something ... happened, i'd know.
scene direction: tara softly
tara: and so would you.
scene direction: anya calmer
anya: you think?
tara: i'm sure of it.
scene direction: tara hugs her
tara: they're fine.
scene direction: shot of tara over anya's shoulder as they hug. she strokes anya's hair.
scene direction: tara trying to convince herself
tara: they're both fine.
scene direction: tara pulls back to look at anya.
tara: maybe they got lost, in the woods.
anya: the woods? are we going back to the woods? i hate the woods. all those woodsy trees.
scene direction: tara excited
tara: no, it's okay. lost is good. willow and i always know how to find each other!
scene direction: she runs to the round table, shoves all the stuff off of it and climbs up on it, sits cross-legged and puts her hands on her knees. (see episode "fear itself")
anya: with yoga?
tara: ssh!
scene direction: tara eyes closed
tara: aradia, hear my words.
scene change: cut to the forest. xander and willow are walking along. willow is panting, leans on xander for support.
xander: okay, this is really starting to grate my cheese. these woods aren't that big. now, i know we've been going straight because i've been following the north star.
scene direction: willow looks up
willow: xander.
scene direction: willow they stop
willow: that's not the north star. it's an airplane.
scene direction: willow makes a pained face, staggers over to a tree and leans against it.
xander: nah, that's not an airplane, it's definitely ...
scene direction: xander looks harder
xander: ...a blimp!
scene direction: xander embarrassed
xander: but i can see how one ... could make that airplane mistake.
scene direction: willow panting
willow: i, i can't walk any more. i need to rest.
xander: it can't be much further.
willow: you said that an hour ago. i just ... that spell took a lot out of me.
xander: as for example, snakes? how come you didn't tell us how much- willow: no. not now.
xander: what were we into back there, will?
willow: it doesn't matter anyway.
xander: do not get all avoidy on me.
willow: i'm not avoidy, i just ... we have bigger problems. demons?
xander: demons! ah. there's something you don't see every day.
scene direction: xander sarcastic chuckle
xander: unless you're us.
scene direction: willow annoyed
willow: yeah, and now we're lost, so can we -
scene direction: willow sees something ahead
willow: what's that?
xander: see? avoidy.
scene direction: willow points
willow: over there, that-that light.
scene direction: xander looks
xander: that one moving towards us?
scene direction: we see a blue light in the distance.
xander: incredibly fast?
scene direction: willow calls
willow: hello?
xander: "hello"? we're being hunted, and you're hello-ing a strange fast-moving light in the dark? it could be anything.
scene direction: the light comes closer but is still hard to see through the trees.
xander: it's a motorcycle headlight.
scene direction: willow smiling
willow: no, too small.
xander: stay behind me.
scene direction: xander picks up a stick from the ground, moves forward
willow: xander, i don't- xander: stay down. i'll take care of this.
scene direction: the light flies right up to xander and circles his head. it's a small blue ball of light.
willow: xander, it's- xander: a bug! a big fiery bug!
scene direction: willow trying to shoo it away
willow: xander- xander: get off! do fireflies bite? no, they probably burn, don't they? they - yaa!
scene direction: willow smiling
willow: xander, it's not a bug.
scene direction: willow as it flies around her face
willow: it's tara.
scene direction: willow pushes away from the tree and follows the light as it moves off.
willow: come on.
scene direction: she moves past xander and on through the trees. xander follows.
xander: and how long have you known that your girlfriend's tinkerbell?
scene change: cut to buffy walking down residential streets. a siren wails in the background. buffy goes to a car that's parked on a driveway, leans against it.
scene direction: the car's lights come on and its security system begins to wail and honk. buffy presses her hands over her ears in pain. the house lights come on. the front door opens and a man comes out.
homeowner: what are you doing?
scene direction: buffy peers at him through her fingers. her vision is still very blurry. the man is holding a shotgun.
homeowner: get away from there!
scene direction: buffy squints at him.
homeowner: do you hear me?
scene direction: homeowner walks onto the porch
homeowner: i said get off my property!
scene direction: buffy continues frowning and squinting.
homeowner: leave us alone.
scene direction: homeowner yells
homeowner: get outta here!
scene direction: he fires into the air. buffy turns and runs off.
scene change: cut to dawn and spike running around the side of the summers house, crouching down behind a bush against the wall. spike looks out at the street. dawn tries to move forward to look too, but he shoves her behind him.
spike: get back.
scene direction: we see some demons riding their bikes up onto the porch of a house across the street. spike gets up a little so he can see better. the demons break some windows and go into the house. we can see people inside.
scene direction: spike continues watching as we hear a woman screaming. a small smile flicks across spike's face. dawn peers over his shoulder.
dawn: i-it looks like they're just ... wrecking stuff. no thought other than just destruct-o-rama.
scene direction: the demons throw some chairs out through the windows.
scene direction: spike grins. dawn notices it.
dawn: what?
spike: uh, oh, nothing, just, uh ...
scene direction: spike nods toward the action
spike: looked like fun.
scene direction: spike dawn gives him a look
spike: i'm just sayin'. yeah, it's just ...
scene direction: spike looks around
spike: with this kind of frolicking going on all around town, we're not gonna get very far without...
scene direction: spike spies something, moves away from the wall. dawn watches.
scene direction: there's a kid-sized football helmet and a baseball bat lying on the ground. spike picks up the helmet, tosses it to dawn. she catches it, looks confused. spike points at her, walks away.
scene change: cut to a demon on motorcycle coming around a corner at a high rate of speed. the tires screech.
scene direction: in the foreground we can see spike's hand twitching as the demon rides toward him.
scene direction: long shot of spike standing in the middle of the street. the demon keeps coming. spike doesn't move.
scene direction: at the last second, spike leaps up into the air, kicking the demon off the bike. the demon lands hard. spike runs over to the crashed bike, picks it up and gets on it.
spike: let's fly, pigeon!
scene change: cut to dawn beside the house. she puts the helmet on and runs off.
scene direction: the demons come running out of the house just in time to see spike and dawn go roaring away on the motorcycle.
scene change: cut to the magic shop. frantic knocking on the door. anya and tara go to it.
scene direction: anya calls

scene direction: anya hugs him
xander: wow, then why was i so worried?
scene direction: tara leading willow to a chair
tara: are you- willow: uh, not yet. but, but i will be.
scene direction: willow eases into the chair with a pained expression. tara stands behind her stroking her hair.
willow: where's dawn and spike?
tara: we've been calling the house, but- xander: maybe they're on their way here. i mean, this place is norad, and we are at defcon one.
scene direction: the women all look at him in confusion.
xander: okay, i so need male friends.
willow: we have to go out and look for them.
scene direction: willow tries to get up but tara pushes her back down
xander: there's this guy at work i kind of hit it off with. tito. i mean, he seems like a good...
scene direction: once again they all give him a look.
scene direction: xander embarrassed
xander: you were talking about dawn and spike, of course.
anya: um, question.
scene direction: anya to willow
anya: you want us to go back out there?
willow: well, yeah. uh, unless somebody's got a better idea.
anya: well, um, it's just ... we're minus a buffybot. and, uh, spike is missing in action somewhere with dawn, and giles flew away, and, uh, well you, you're looking a little magicked-out.
xander: ahn honey, we're nearing your point, right?
anya: it's just, how are we supposed to fight these guys?
scene direction: anya everyone looks at her
anya: i mean, we can take a vampire or two, sure, but there's a whole cavalcade of demons out there ...
scene direction: anya uncertainly
anya: i mean, i think this, you know ... it, it takes, um ... i mean, i ... we need...
xander: buffy.
scene direction: anya softly
anya: buffy.
scene direction: willow harshly
willow: buffy...
scene direction: they nod expectantly.
willow: ...is not coming back.
scene direction: willow sadly
willow: we failed.
scene direction: anya looks dismayed. the others look sad.
willow: so ... we're it, gang.
scene direction: willow gets painfully to her feet
willow: xander, grab the weapons. we're gonna look for dawn and spike.
scene direction: sound of glass breaking. they all turn to look.
tara: if we're gonna go, we should go now, they're just getting more and more worked up by the moment.
xander: well, they can't keep it up forever. i mean, maybe they'll party themselves out, you know, tire of this place and move on.
scene change: cut to razor addressing his minions.
razor: say hello to your new home, boys.
scene direction: the demons cheer. several of them have bottles of beer. one of them takes a mouthful of beer and blows it at his torch, creating a huge flame.
scene direction: we see that they're gathered in an open space (parking lot?) with a few barrels full of fire. a burning pile of trash in the background.
razor: this here is a momentous occasion, the beginning of a new era.
scene direction: we see buffy walking slowly toward them, looking around.
razor: now, no question, the open backroads and highways have been good to us. but we've got ourselves a juicy little burg here, just ripe for the picking. and i ain't in no hurry to leave it, you?
scene direction: the demons all yell "no" as buffy walks closer. we see them from her point of view, about a hundred feet away and still blurry.
razor: so i figure, what better way to kick off our ... semi-settling-down, than with a little christening?
scene direction: the demons cheer.
scene direction: we see a couple of demons attaching chains to their motorcycles. they grin at each other as the cheering continues. buffy walks closer.
razor: a symbolic act commemorating the new order around here ... and ridding ourselves of any not-so-pleasant reminders of the old.
scene direction: razor is holding a gun. he holds it up and theatrically puts a bullet in.
razor: all in one quick, really, *really* violent fell swoop.
scene direction: buffy comes right up behind a couple of the demons. she still looks very muddled. they don't notice her.
scene direction: razor holds up the gun
razor: gentlemen, start your engines.
scene direction: the demons start up their bikes. we get a very quick look at the bikes with chains attached, and the buffybot among them. the demons sit still on their bikes, engines rumbling.
scene direction: we see the bot standing there with chains attached to both her arms.
scene direction: the real buffy catches sight of the bot, and her eyes widen in shock.
scene direction: the bot sees buffy and also looks surprised.
razor: bye-bye, slayer!
scene direction: buffy takes a step closer. we see the bot's mouth say "buffy" but we can't hear her over the engines.
scene direction: razor fires into the air. the bikes begin to move.
scene direction: buffy screams
buffy: no!
scene direction: the demons nearest buffy hear her scream and turn around.
scene direction: the four motorcycles all move off in four different directions. each bike is attached to one of the bot's limbs. her arms and legs are ripped from her body and her torso goes flying. razor grins.
scene direction: buffy looks around anxiously. the demons near her move aside so that all the demons can see her.
scene direction: razor looking at buffy
razor: another one for the fire, boys.
scene direction: buffy looks alarmed.
razor: tear it up.
scene direction: buffy backs away, turns and begins to run.
scene direction: blackout.
scene change: *** act iii ***
scene direction: open on buffy running down the street. a demon on a motorcycle comes from behind and cuts in front of her, cutting her off. she turns to see another one coming at her, swinging a chain over his head. buffy runs toward that demon as the first one follows. she ducks, and the chain hits the first demon, knocking him off his bike.
demon: sorry. sorry.
scene direction: buffy gets up and runs off.
scene change: cut to xander and anya walking down the street. xander has an axe over his shoulder. pan forward to reveal tara and willow walking ahead of them. willow carries a crossbow.
tara: it wasn't your fault. we, we don't know if the spell would have worked, even if the demons hadn't- willow: it would have worked.
tara: well ... maybe...
willow: what?
tara: maybe it wasn't supposed to. i mean, those demons showing up at the exact wrong time? maybe we really were in over our heads. invoking forces that we have no right to. maybe the fates sent down all that destruction on us to stop us. i mean...
willow: you mean, maybe it was my fault.
tara: no. no.
scene direction: they put their arms around each other, continue walking.
scene change: cut to buffy leaping over a pile of stuff and flinging herself over a fence. a motorcycle screeches to a stop behind her. the demon growls angrily.
scene direction: cut back to the scoobies still walking.
scene direction: anya softly to xander
anya: i'm not saying we announce it this second.
scene direction: xander whispers
xander: anya!
anya: well, i think it would please them to know we're engaged. and i think willow in particular could use a real morale-booster right now.
xander: can we talk about this later?
anya: well, but it's just all the excuses for not telling everyone we're engaged are gone now. i mean, aside from hell bikers, there's nothing standing in our way. this is it. no more surprises.
scene direction: suddenly they all stop walking as something drops to the ground in front of them.
xander: watch it!
scene direction: it's buffy. she crouches there staring at them through her hair. she rises to her feet.
anya: it ... it's the buffy bot.
xander: ah, peachy. no doubt to lead the wild bunch right to us again. hey will, next time this thing's damaged, couldn't ya program it to find the nearest radio shack, or...
scene direction: xander breaks off when he sees the look on willow's face.
scene direction: zoom in slowly on willow, staring at buffy in wonder.
willow: buffy?
scene direction: buffy stares fearfully, then turns and runs away.
willow: buffy!
xander: buffy!
scene direction: the gang runs after her.
willow: buffy!
scene change: cut to the scoobies coming around a corner into another alley.
anya: where is she?
scene direction: willow stops. we see buffy crouched in a corner between a wall and some random junk.
willow: buffy?
scene direction: willow moves toward her
willow: buffy, are you...
scene direction: buffy sits huddled in on herself with her hair obscuring her face. the scoobies walk toward her.
willow: it's willow. can you hear me?
scene direction: buffy looks up, back, and all around, very nervously.
scene direction: anya whispers
anya: what's wrong with her?
willow: nothing! she - she's ... she's in shock.
tara: her hands are bleeding. her fingers.
scene direction: close-up of buffy's hands, which are covered with blood.
scene direction: anya os

scene direction: xander shakes his head in dismay.
xander: oh no.
scene direction: willow os
willow: what?
xander: no. how could we ... so stupid!
willow: xander!
xander: our spell. our resurrection spell worked like a magic charm. we brought you back to life, buffy.
scene direction: xander looks at willow
xander: right where we left her.
scene direction: willow and tara look shocked.
willow: oh god.
xander: in her coffin.
scene direction: willow turns in anguish to tara, who hugs her.
tara: she had to ... dig out of her own grave.
scene direction: buffy continues crouching there fearfully.
scene direction: shot of the group from buffy's pov, still blurry. xander bends over to look in her face.
scene direction: xander muffled
xander: buffy.
scene direction: shot of buffy from their pov.
scene direction: xander loudly
xander: buffy, it's xander.
scene direction: back to buffy's pov.
scene direction: xander muffled
xander: we're sorry. we didn't know.
scene direction: buffy turns her head away, letting her hair cover her face again.
xander: buffy.
tara: you aren't reaching her, she's too traumatized.
scene direction: anya touches xander on the back, and he moves aside so anya can take his place.
anya: hey, buffy. uh, here's some good news that might perk you right up. uh, xander and i have an announcement.
xander: anya!
scene direction: xander grabs her arm, pulls her away.
anya: what? just trying to help.
scene direction: xander bends over in front of buffy again.
xander: buffy ... it's gonna be all right. we brought you back. you're home now.
scene direction: buffy slowly raises her head, looks at him. shot of xander from buffy's pov.
scene direction: xander muffled
xander: yeah, that's it. you're home.
razor: yeah, welcome home, slayer.
scene direction: the scoobies turn to see several demons behind them.
razor: alive and kickin' after all!
scene direction: the scoobies look alarmed. so does buffy.
razor: well, alive, anyway.
scene direction: shot of the demons from buffy's pov.
scene direction: razor muffled
razor: not looking too good, though, is she?
scene direction: xander muffled
xander: i don't see you winning too many beauty contests.
scene change: cut to front view of xander with the axe over his shoulder.
xander: ...unless the miss "my face fell off" pageant gets going.
razor: big axe you got there.
xander: the better to cut you down to size, grandma.
scene direction: the other scoobies look nervous. razor grins, takes a step forward.
tara: incindere.
scene direction: a gout of flame spurts up from the ground between razor and xander. razor steps back.
razor: ah. so you got a witch in the mix.
tara: more than one.
xander: i happen to be a very powerful man-witch myself.
scene direction: xander razor looks amused
xander: or ... male...
scene direction: xander over his shoulder to willow
xander: is it a warlock?
scene direction: willow nods. xander turns back to razor.
xander: warlock.
anya: plus, we have a slayer here, uh, who might actually be looking to eat some brains, so, i think a little quiet moseying, no hard feelings, and i'm sure your demon horde won't think any the less of you.
scene direction: razor shakes head
razor: now, my boys, see, that's tricky. they came looking for a massacre...
scene direction: we see buffy looking a bit more aware, starting to rise.
scene direction: razor buffy's pov, muffled
razor: ...and i think you got exactly enough magic between you for a kiddie birthday party.
scene direction: willow steps forward.
willow: then you'd be wrong.
razor: whoa. well, i better back off, or you might, what? pull a rabbit out of a hat?
scene direction: anya horrified
anya: don't, don't do that!
scene direction: anya to tara
anya: why would she do that?
scene direction: anya tara shakes her head
willow: we don't want trouble ... you don't want trouble.
razor: of course we want trouble, we're demons. we're really all about trouble.
willow: not this kind.
razor: oh. i get your point.
scene direction: he backhands willow, who flies backward and lands on top of some boxes. xander charges but razor shoves him aside and he falls to the ground.
scene direction: anya and tara each go to their respective partners.
razor: now let me tell you something, children. we're not gonna fight you. we're just gonna hold you down and enjoy ourselves for a few hours.
scene direction: shot of tara gently turning over an unconscious willow. in the background, buffy rises to her feet, looking at willow.
scene direction: razor os
razor: you might even live through it.
scene direction: razor buffy walks forward
razor: except that certain of my boys got some...
scene direction: shot of razor grinning evilly.
razor: ...anatomical incompatibilities that, uh, tend to tear up little girls.
scene direction: razor grins
razor: so, who wants to go first?
scene direction: buffy comes over to stand directly in front of him.
razor: i was really hoping it'd be you.
scene direction: he hits her in the face. her head whips to the side but she doesn't otherwise move. razor looks a little uncertain.
scene direction: slowly, she turns her head back to face him again. there's blood on her lip. her face hardens into her famous "i'm gonna kick your ass" expression.
scene direction: razor throws another punch but buffy stops it, grabbing his fist and holding it immobile. with her other hand she punches him in the face twice, then she kicks him. he falls to the ground unconscious.
scene direction: the other demons look on nervously.
scene direction: willow sits up, stares.
scene direction: pan across razor's inert body to buffy standing over it looking confused.
scene direction: xander and anya stare.
anya: does this mean we win?
scene direction: the other demons yell and attack buffy. she kicks one of them back. xander and anya get up. buffy blocks another demon's weapon and kicks him in the stomach.
scene direction: another demon attacks xander who blocks with his axe, then punches the demon.
scene direction: buffy blocks a punch and punches the demon in the face, then punches another one.
scene direction: willow loads her crossbow and fires, hitting a demon in the middle of the chest.
scene direction: a demon attacks buffy with a knife and she grabs his arm in both hands, pauses to kick another demon away behind her, swings the one with the knife around and throws him into another demon, shoves another one away, ducks and punches, ducks and punches again.
scene direction: then buffy is surrounded by demons hitting her with various weapons, and she huddles down on the ground under their blows. suddenly she springs back up again, throwing them off her. she kicks one in the groin and he takes two more down with him.
scene direction: another demon thrusts a baseball bat at buffy and she grabs it, uses one end to hit a demon behind her, then uses the other end to hit the first demon.
scene change: cut to main street. it's deserted but littered with debris, some of which is on fire. a motorcycle comes roaring down the street.
scene direction: cut closer and we see that it's spike and dawn. dawn sees something up ahead.
dawn: there. what's that?
scene direction: spike looks, turns toward it. they pass a flaming barrel, then drive into the open space where the demons were partying. it's deserted now too. spike brings the bike to a stop next to the pile of flaming rubble.
scene direction: they both dismount, staring at something on the ground. dawn takes the helmet off and tosses it aside as they move forward.
scene direction: shot of buffybot's torso lying on the ground, wires dangling everywhere from her arm and leg sockets.
spike: it's just a machine, dawn.
dawn: i know.
scene direction: dawn kneels beside the bot. spike turns, walks away a bit.
scene direction: dawn reaches out to close the bot's eyes, but suddenly the head turns and looks at her. dawn gasps.
buffybot: dawn. you're my sister dawn.
scene direction: dawn doesn't know what to say. she gives a tentative smile.
scene direction: buffybot looks around in confusion
buffybot: where did i go?
dawn: what?
buffybot: where did i go? i was here. here. but then i ran away.
scene direction: dawn confused
dawn: i-i don't...
buffybot: no. not me. the other buffy.
scene direction: dawn's eyes widen in shock.
buffybot: yes. the other buffy.
dawn: buffy?
buffybot: i don't ... i don't ... know where she ran off to. maybe- she freezes in mid-word, staring blankly.
scene direction: dawn backs away, gets up, still shocked. she stares at the lifeless bot, turns and runs away.
scene change: cut to spike picking up a piece of twisted metal from the scrap pile. it's one of the bot's legs.
spike: tsk. look what those filthy buggers done to you.
scene direction: spike loudly, to dawn
spike: willow's slap-and-paste job's not gonna do the trick this time. robot's done.
scene direction: he looks up, notices dawn is gone.
spike: hey.
scene direction: spike looks all around, alarmed
spike: little bit?
scene direction: spike yells
spike: dawn!
scene change: cut to dawn running down the street.
scene direction: spike os
spike: dawn!
scene change: cut to tara being held against the wall by a demon who has her by the throat. willow hits him in the head with her crossbow and he falls back.
scene direction: another demon has xander down on a pile of wood but he manages to get his feet up and kick the demon away. xander leaps to his feet and slams his axe down into the demon.
scene direction: buffy turns from fighting one demon with the baseball bat and another one flings a length of chain, which wraps around the bat. the demon uses it to pull the bat out of buffy's hand. then he attacks her with a knife. she blocks, grabs the knife-wielding arm, and uses it to stab another demon as he charges. then buffy kicks out behind her, kicking away another demon, and as for the one she's holding, she twists his head around, breaking his neck.
scene direction: buffy stops, looking around. all the demons are defeated. the scoobies approach from their various places.
tara: well, they wanted a massacre.
scene direction: they stand in a row staring at buffy.
xander: she's buffy. she's herself again.
scene direction: xander she looks at him
xander: you're back, buffy, you really are.
scene direction: xander moves as if to hug her, but she takes a quick step back, looking fearful.
xander: whoa.
scene direction: xander gently
xander: whoa.
scene direction: buffy looks around in anguish. she lifts her bloody hand to her mouth, wipes the blood from her lip, looks at her hand. she looks about to cry. she walks forward. the others watch uncertainly.
scene direction: buffy goes past xander and breaks into a run, taking off around the corner.
willow: buffy!
scene direction: the scoobies watch her go.
anya: where's she going?
tara: should we follow her?
willow: i don't know.
xander: she just ... needs some time is all.
scene direction: shot of razor lying on the ground, apparently dead. suddenly his eyes open.
scene direction: xander os
xander: the important thing is that she's back. she'll be fine.
scene direction: shot of razor's hand. the metal claws shoot out of his fingers.
scene direction: blackout.
scene change: *** act iv ***
scene direction: open on razor getting to his feet with a snarl. we see that he's standing behind xander.
anya: xander, look out!
scene direction: anya shoves xander to the ground as razor attacks. the blow misses as xander hits the ground butt-first.
scene direction: the others watch fearfully as razor advances on xander, who scrambles backward on his butt.
razor: now what kind of slayer is it runs out on her buddies just when they need her the most?
scene direction: xander grabs a trash-can lid and holds it up as a shield as razor attacks again. the metal claws slice right through the shield. xander looks scared.
scene change: cut to buffy walking quickly down an alley. suddenly she stops, turns as a demon swings a piece of metal at her. she ducks and hits him, kicks him in the groin, grabs him and throws him against a wall where another piece of metal impales him. he falls dead.
scene direction: buffy stares at him, then looks up. above the roof of the nearest building we see the tower that glory's minions built. buffy runs off.
scene direction: cut back to razor about to strike xander again. suddenly he's struck from behind. he turns and all three women attack him -- willow and anya with sticks, tara with a piece of chain. he covers his head with his hands as they beat on him.
scene direction: then razor does the same move that buffy did earlier, straightening up and flinging them off of him. they all fall back.
scene direction: willow holds up her hand.
willow: obfuscate.
scene direction: a gray ball appears in her hand and she throws it at razor. it covers his face with some kind of goo, so he can't see. he roars and pulls at it with his hands.
scene change: cut to dawn running around a corner, hearing razor yell in the background. she sees the impaled demon and comes to a stop, staring in disgust. she edges around him, looks up and sees the tower. she starts forward with determination.
scene change: cut to buffy at the foot of the tower, looking up. shot from her pov of the tower with the narrow walkway extending out.
scene direction: cut back to razor still trying to pry the stuff off his face as the others resume hitting him. xander sits up.
scene direction: razor finally pulls the stuff off, grabs anya by the shoulders and shoves her away. she lands on the ground. xander gets up and rushes razor, gets elbowed in the face and falls back.
scene direction: tara rushes razor and he grabs her by the throat.
willow: fragilis.
scene direction: another ball of light appears in willow's hand and shoots over to tara. razor swipes his claws across tara's chest but the metal claws break off and fall away without harming her. razor stares at his fingers, thrusts tara away. she falls among some trash.
scene direction: razor grabs willow by the throat and lifts her up.
razor: so, witch, got a little power after all. well, let's see what tricks you can manage while i choke the life outta- suddenly he gasps and lets willow go. she falls to the ground. razor falls face-first beside her, with the axe buried in his back.
scene direction: willow looks up to see tara standing there. tara bends over and helps willow up.
willow: tara!
tara: nobody messes with my girl.
scene direction: xander and anya come over.
xander: tara, nice axing.
tara: my first.
scene direction: they all look at the dead demon.
willow: buffy.
scene direction: they all turn and walk off.
scene change: cut to shot of the tower from afar.
scene change: cut to the top. buffy stands at the end of the platform looking down. we hear creaking noises.
scene direction: shot of the view from the platform. the ground below is just an open space.
scene direction: buffy frowns slightly.
scene direction: flashback of dawn's blood dripping, opening the hole in midair, lightning flashing.
scene direction: flashback of buffy running down the platform, swan-diving into the thing.
scene direction: cut back to now. buffy stands staring, presses her eyes shut tightly.
scene direction: flashback of buffy standing on the tower with dawn, turning away from dawn to look at holes opening in the sky. buffy turning back to dawn.
scene direction: cut back to now. buffy still has her eyes closed.
scene direction: dawn flashback
dawn: buffy, no.
scene direction: buffy now
buffy: dawnie, i have to.
scene direction: dawn now
dawn: buffy?
scene direction: buffy frowns, opens her eyes, turns. dawn is standing at the other end of the platform, in the little arch at the top of the tower.
dawn: buffy...
scene direction: buffy looks apprehensively at her.
dawn: buffy ...
scene direction: dawn amazed
dawn: how...
scene direction: buffy frowns at her in confusion.
dawn: is it you? i mean really?
scene direction: dawn smiles tentatively, starts to take a step forward.
dawn: what are you do- the tower creaks and shudders under dawn's feet. she grabs the pole beside her for support, looks down fearfully.
scene direction: shot from below as the whole tower shakes.
scene direction: cut back to above. buffy turns back to the end of the platform.
scene direction: dawn shrieks
dawn: no!
scene direction: buffy looks down at the ground below.
dawn: don't!
scene direction: buffy turns back to dawn.
dawn: don't jump, buffy, don't move! just walk to me. please!
scene direction: buffy looks uncertain, turns away again.
dawn: please?
scene direction: buffy continues staring down. the tower continues to creak.
dawn: i'm your sister. dawn. we were up here ... together, and then ... you went away. and you don't wanna do that again. i don't know how you're back, but you are, and please, just stay still.
scene direction: the tower shakes again, making dawn shriek and fight for balance.
dawn: or-or move. but-but towards me. because the tower was built by crazy people and i don't think it's holding up very well.
scene direction: beat. buffy continues staring down.
danw: talk to me. say something!
scene direction: the tower creaks.
scene direction: buffy quietly
buffy: is ... this hell?
scene direction: dawn confused
dawn: what?
scene direction: buffy turns to face dawn with an anguished frown.
buffy: is this hell?
dawn: no! buffy, no!
scene direction: dawn taking a tiny step closer
dawn: you're here ... with me.
scene direction: dawn another tiny step
dawn: whatever happened to you, whatever you've been through, it's ... it's over now. you're- the tower shakes again. dawn shrieks dawn: we have to get off this tower!
scene direction: buffy turns to look down again.
scene direction: buffy quietly
buffy: it was so ... clear ... on this spot. i remember ... how ... shiny ... and clear everything was.
scene direction: buffy shakes her head
buffy: but ... now ... now...
dawn: buffy ... please ... listen to me.
scene direction: buffy closes her eyes, doesn't turn around.
dawn: you told me i had to be strong ... and i've tried.
scene direction: dawn tearful
dawn: but it's been so hard without you.
scene direction: buffy still has eyes closed, frowning.
dawn: i'm sorry. i promise i'll do better, i will!
scene direction: dawn still tearful
dawn: if you're with me. stay with me ... please. i need you to live. live! for- the tower shakes again, hard. dawn screams and crouches down. piece of the tower fall off.
dawn: buffy!
scene direction: buffy whirls around.
scene direction: buffy softly
buffy: dawn.
dawn: buffy!
scene direction: buffy louder
buffy: dawn!
scene direction: buffy runs across the platform to dawn, pulls her up and into the body of the tower. they run around one bend, pause and look around.
scene direction: shot of a pulley with a rope going through it.
scene direction: buffy holds onto dawn, leaps off the tower and grabs the rope. they hang there for a moment, then the rope begins to move and they plummet downward. dawn screams. shot of the pulley with the rope zooming through it, sending up smoke. shot of a bolt working its way loose.
scene direction: they fall for a while and then something catches and they stop. they both look toward the ground, still a long ways off.
scene direction: the bolt holding the pulley secure breaks off, and they fall the rest of the way, dawn screaming the whole time. they land on some cardboard on the ground.
scene direction: they both lie on their backs gasping. buffy looks up and sees the entire platform break off the tower and fall toward them. buffy grabs dawn, they both get up and run off an instant before the platform falls on the cardboard.
scene direction: long shot of the entire tower crumbling and falling to the ground. it makes a huge sustained noise.
scene direction: buffy and dawn go around a corner and collapse on the ground, panting. dawn winces in pain, looks up at buffy's face. the noise dies away.
scene direction: dawn tentatively
dawn: buffy?
scene direction: buffy looks at her apprehensively. dawn smiles in disbelief.
dawn: buffy. you ... you ...
scene direction: dawn touches buffy's cheek
dawn: ...you're really here.
scene direction: dawn hugs buffy.
scene direction: dawn crying
dawn: you're alive, and you're home. you're home.
scene direction: shot of buffy's face over dawn's shoulder. she doesn't look very happy.
scene direction: blackout.
