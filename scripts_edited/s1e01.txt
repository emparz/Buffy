darla: i heard a noise.
boy: it's nothing!

scene change: cut to principal flutie's office. buffy is seated. he has her school records and walks around the desk to his chair as he looks them over.
mr. flutie: buffy summers, sophomore, late of hemery high in los angeles. interesting record, quite a career...
scene direction: he sits, takes the sheet he's reading and tears it into four pieces.
mr. flutie: welcome to sunnydale! a clean slate, buffy, that's what you get here. what's past is past. we're not interested in what it says on a piece of paper, even if it says...
scene direction: mr. flutie reads
mr. flutie: whoa.
buffy: mr. flutie...
mr. flutie: all the kids here are free to call me bob.
buffy: bob...
mr. flutie: but they don't.
scene direction: he begins reassembling the torn sheet.
buffy: i know my transcripts are a little... colorful.
mr. flutie: heeey... we're not caring about that. do you think, uh, 'colorful' is the word?
scene direction: mr. flutie tapes the paper
mr. flutie: not, uh, 'dismal'?
buffy: wasn't *that* bad!
mr. flutie: you burned down the gym.
scene direction: buffy exhales
buffy: i did, i really did, but... you're not seeing the big picture here, i mean, that gym was full of vampi... asbestos.
mr. flutie: buffy, don't worry. any other school they might say 'watch your step', or 'we'll be watching you'... but, that's just not the way *here*. we want to service your needs, and help you to respect our needs. and if your needs and our needs don't mesh...
scene direction: he puts the poorly repaired sheet back into her file and slaps it shut.
scene direction: she gives him a thin, nervous smile.
scene change: cut to the hall. buffy comes out of mr. flutie's office. she opens her bag and rummages through it as she walks into the hall right in front of a girl and a boy. the girl bumps into her, making her lose her grip on the bag and spill its contents.
buffy: oh! sorry!
girl: that's okay.
scene direction: buffy looks down at the mess
buffy: oh...
scene direction: xander hears the noise, looks back, quickly comes over and squats down next to her to help her gather her things.
xander: can i have you?
scene direction: she gives him a confused look.
xander: duh...
scene direction: xander chuckles
xander: can i help you?
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: thanks.
xander: i don't know you, do i?
buffy: i'm buffy. i'm new.
xander: xander. is, is me. hi.
scene direction: xander smiles
buffy: um, thanks.
scene direction: they finish gathering up everything.
xander: well, uh, maybe i'll see you around... maybe at school... since we... both... go there.
buffy: great!
scene direction: buffy they stand up
buffy: it was nice to meet you.
scene direction: she starts down the hall.
scene direction: xander unimpressed with himself
xander: we both go to school. very suave. very not pathetic.
scene direction: he notices a stake still on the floor.
xander: oh, hey!
scene direction: xander picks it up
xander: hey, you forgot your... stake!
scene direction: buffy doesn't hear him and continues down the hall. xander holds on to the stake.
scene change: cut to a classroom. the teacher writes 'the black death' on the board and then turns to the class.
teacher: it's estimated that about 25 million people died in that one four-year span. but the fun part of the black plague is that it originated in europe how?
scene direction: cordelia is taking notes. so is buffy, seated next to her.
teacher: as an early form of germ warfare. if you'll look at the map on page 63 you can trace the spread of the disease into rome, and then north...
scene direction: buffy doesn't have a book and looks around for help. cordelia notices and shares her book.
scene direction: buffy to cordelia
buffy: thanks.
teacher: and this popular plague led to what social changes? steve?
scene direction: the bell rings and the students get up to leave.
cordelia: hi! i'm cordelia.
scene direction: cordelia offers her hand
scene direction: buffy accepts it
buffy: i'm buffy.
cordelia: if you're looking for a textbook of your very own there's probably a few in the library.
buffy: oh, great, thanks.
scene direction: buffy they get up
buffy: where would that be?
cordelia: i'll show you, come on.
scene direction: cordelia they start out of the classroom
cordelia: so you're from hemery, right? in l.a.?
buffy: uh, yeah.
cordelia: oh, i would *kill* to live in l.a. that close to that many shoes?
scene direction: buffy has to laugh as they go into the hall.
scene change: cut to the two of them walking down another part of the hall.
cordelia: well, you'll be okay here. if you hang with me and mine, you'll be accepted in no time. of course, we do have to test your coolness factor. you're from l.a., so you can skip the written, but let's see. vamp nail polish.
buffy: um, over?
cordelia: so over. james spader.
buffy: he needs to call me!
cordelia: frappaccinos.
buffy: trendy, but tasty.
cordelia: john tesh.
buffy: the devil.
cordelia: that was pretty much a gimme, but... you passed!
buffy: oh, goody!
scene direction: they turn toward a drinking fountain. willow is there. she straightens up and sees them coming.
cordelia: willow! nice dress! good to know you've seen the softer side of sears.
willow: uh, oh, well, my mom picked it out.
cordelia: no wonder you're such a guy magnet. are you done?
scene direction: willow looks at the fountain, then back at cordelia.
willow: oh!
scene direction: she turns and leaves. buffy watches her go for a moment, then looks back at cordelia after she starts talking again.
cordelia: you wanna fit in here, the first rule is: know your losers. once you can identify them all by sight
scene direction: cordelia glances after willow
cordelia: they're a lot easier to avoid.
scene direction: buffy lets out a nervous laugh and nods. she looks at willow again, who has gone through the door at the end of the hall. willow looks back at them before she continues.
scene change: cut to another area in the halls. the two of them continue their walk to the library.
cordelia: and if you're not too swamped with catching up you should come by the bronze tonight.
buffy: the who?
cordelia: the bronze. it's the only club worth going to around here. they let anybody in, but it's still the scene. it's in the bad part of town.
buffy: where's that?
scene direction: buffy stops outside the library doors
cordelia: about a half a block from the good part of town.
scene direction: cordelia laughing
cordelia: we don't have a whole lot of town here. but, um, you should show!
buffy: well, i'll try.
scene direction: buffy looks toward the library
buffy: uh, thanks.
cordelia: good. so, um, i'll see you in gym, and you can tell me absolutely everything there is to know about you.
scene direction: cordelia waves and goes
scene direction: buffy waves back
buffy: great!
scene direction: buffy to herself
buffy: oh, that sounds like fun.
scene change: she goes into the library. cut to inside. she comes in and looks around.
scene direction: it looks deserted.
buffy: hello?
scene direction: buffy continues in
buffy: is anybody here?
scene direction: she looks on the counter and sees a newspaper with a picture that's been circled. the caption above the picture reads 'local boys still missing'.
scene direction: giles comes up behind her and taps her on the shoulder. she spins around, startled.
buffy: ooo!
scene direction: buffy exhales
buffy: anybody's here!
giles: can i help you?
buffy: i was looking for some, well, books. i'm new.
giles: miss summers?
buffy: good call! guess i'm the only new kid, huh?
giles: i'm mr. giles. the librarian. i was told you were coming.
scene direction: he heads around behind the counter.
buffy: great! so, um, i'm gonna need 'perspectives on 20th century...' giles:
scene direction: buffy interrupting
buffy: i know what you're after!
scene direction: with a big grin on his face he pulls out a large old book with the word 'vampyr' written in gold leaf on the front cover. buffy looks up at him with an uneasy gaze.
buffy: that's not what i'm looking for.
giles: are you sure?
buffy: i'm way sure.
scene direction: giles confused
giles: my mistake.
scene direction: he puts the book back behind the counter. buffy quickly leaves.
scene direction: giles straightening back up
giles: so, what is it you said...
scene direction: he sees her go out of the library. their first encounter leaves him puzzled.
scene change: cut to the girls' locker room. two girls are discussing buffy.
aphrodisia: the new kid? she seems kind of weird to me. what kind of name is buffy?
girl: hey, aphrodisia!
aphrodisia: oh, hey!
aura: well, the chatter in the caf is that she got kicked out, and that's why her mom had to get a new job.
scene direction: the girls work the combinations to their gym lockers.
aphrodisia: neg!
aura: pos! she was starting fights!
aphrodisia: neg-ly!
scene direction: aura opening her locker
aura: well i heard from blue, and she said that...
scene direction: the dead boy falls out of the locker onto aura's arm. she screams and lets the body fall.
scene change: *** part 2 ***
scene direction: outside at school. willow is sitting on a bench in front of a wall taking out her lunch. buffy approaches her.
buffy: uh, hi! willow, right?
scene direction: willow looks up
willow: why? i-i mean, hi! uh, did you want me to move?
buffy: why don't we start with 'hi, i'm buffy,' and, uh, then let's segue directly into me asking you for a favor.
scene direction: buffy sits next to her
buffy: it doesn't involve moving, but it does involve hanging out with me for a while.
willow: but aren't you hanging out with cordelia?
buffy: i can't do both?
willow: not legally.
scene direction: buffy exhales
buffy: look, i really wanna get by here, new school, and... cordelia's been really nice... to me... anyway, but, um, i kinda have this burning desire not to flunk all my classes, and i heard a rumor that you were the person to talk to if i wanted to get caught up.
willow: oh, i could totally help you out! uh, if you have sixth period free we could meet in the library?
buffy: or not. or we could meet someplace quieter. louder. uh, that place just kinda gives me the wiggins.
willow: oh, it has that effect on most kids. i love it, though, it's a great collection, and the new librarian is really cool.
buffy: he's new?
willow: yeah, he just started. he was a curator at some british museum, or, or the british museum, i'm not sure. but he knows everything, and he brought all these historical volumes and biographies and am i the single dullest person alive?
buffy: not at all.
scene direction: xander hops up on the wall behind the girls and sits on it between them.
scene direction: jesse stands in front of them and drops his bag.
jesse: hey!
xander: you guys busy? are we interrupting? we're interrupting.
scene direction: he tosses his bag to jesse.
buffy: hey!
willow: hey!
jesse: hey there!
scene direction: he drops xander's bag next to his own.
willow: buffy, this is jesse and that's xander.
xander: oh, me and buffy go waaay back, old friends, very close. then there's that period of estrangement where i think we were both growing as people, but now here we are, like old times, i'm quite moved.
jesse: is it me, or are you turning into a bibbling idiot?
xander: no, it's, uh, it's not you.
buffy: well, it's nice to meet you guys, i think.
scene direction: xander jumps down to retrieve the stake from his bag.
jesse: well, you know, we wanted to welcome ya, make ya feel at home, unless you have a scary home...
xander: and to return this.
scene direction: xander holds up the stake
xander: the only thing i can think is that you're building a really little fence.
scene direction: xander hands it to her
scene direction: buffy takes it
buffy: hah, no, um, a-a-actually it was for self-defense.
scene direction: everyone has them in l.a. pepper spray is just so passe.
xander: so what do you do for fun, what do you like, what do you look for in a man, let's hear it.
jesse: if you have any dark, painful secrets you'd like us to publish?
buffy: gee, everyone wants to know about me. how keen.
xander: well, not much goes on in a one starbucks town like sunnydale. you're pretty big news.
buffy: i'm not. really.
scene direction: cordelia interrupting
cordelia: are these guys bothering you?
buffy: uh, no!
willow: she's not hanging out with us.
scene direction: jesse stands next to her
jesse: hey! cordelia!
scene direction: cordelia to jesse
cordelia: oh, please!
scene direction: cordelia to buffy
cordelia: i don't mean to interrupt your downward mobility, but i just wanted to tell you that you won't be meeting coach foster, the woman with the chest hair, because gym was canceled due to the *extreme* dead guy in the locker.
buffy: what?
willow: what are you talking about?
cordelia: some guy was stuffed in aura's locker!
buffy: dead.
cordelia: totally dead. way dead.
xander: it's not just a little dead then?
cordelia: don't you have an elsewhere to be?
jesse: y'know, if you need a shoulder to cry on, or just to nibble on...
buffy: how did he die?
cordelia: i don't know.
buffy: well, were there any marks?
cordelia: morbid much! i didn't ask!
scene direction: buffy looks at everyone
buffy: um, i gotta book. i'll, i'll see you guys later.
scene direction: she grabs her things and leaves. cordelia stares after her.
cordelia: what's her deal?
scene change: cut to outside the gym. buffy sneaks up to an outside entrance. it's locked. she uses her strength to break the door and goes in, looking around to make sure no one sees her. cut to the locker room. buffy finds the body and pulls back the sheet. she sees the vampire bite.
buffy: oh, great!
scene change: cut to the library. buffy barges in.
buffy: okay, what's the sitch?
scene direction: giles in the stacks
giles: sorry?
buffy: you heard about the dead guy, right? the dead guy in the locker?
scene direction: giles steps into the light
giles: yes.
scene direction: she drops her bag on the table and heads up the stairs.
buffy: 'cause, it's the weirdest thing. he's got two little, little holes in his neck, and all his blood's been drained.
scene direction: buffy meets him
buffy: isn't that bizarre? aren't you just going, ooo?
giles: i was afraid of this.
buffy: well, i wasn't! it's my first day! i was afraid that i was gonna be behind in all my classes, that i wouldn't make any friends, that i would have last month's hair. i didn't think there'd be vampires on campus. and i don't care.
giles: then why are you here?
buffy: to tell you that... i don't care, which... i don't, and... have now told you, so... bye.
scene direction: buffy turns away to go
giles: is he, w-will he... rise again?
scene direction: buffy turns back
buffy: who?
giles: the boy.
buffy: no. he's just dead.
giles: can you be sure?
buffy: to make you a vampire they have to suck your blood. and then you have to suck their blood. it's like a whole big sucking thing. mostly they're just gonna kill you. why am i still talking to you?
scene direction: buffy turns and goes down the stairs. giles moves over to the railing.
giles: you really have no idea what's going on, do you? you think it's coincidence, your being here? that boy was just the beginning.
buffy: oh, why can't you people just leave me alone?
giles: because you are the slayer.
scene direction: giles comes down the stairs
giles: into each generation a slayer is born, one girl in all the world, a chosen one, one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires...
scene direction: buffy interrupts and joins in
buffy: ...with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires, to stop the spread of their evil blah, blah, blah... i've heard it, okay?
giles: i really don't understand this attitude. you, you've accepted your duty, you, you've slain vampires before...
buffy: yeah, and i've both been there and done that, and i'm moving on.
giles: what do you know about this town?
scene direction: giles goes into his office
buffy: it's two hours on the freeway from neiman marcus?
giles: dig a bit in the history of this place. you'll find a, a steady stream of fairly odd occurrences. now, i believe this whole area is a center of mystical energy,
scene direction: giles comes back with four books
giles: that things gravitate towards it that, that, that you might not find elsewhere.
scene direction: giles sets them on the table
buffy: like vampires.
scene direction: he puts the volumes into buffy's arms one by one as he lists off various monsters and demons.
giles: like zombies, werewolves, incubi, succubi, everything you've ever dreaded was under your bed, but told yourself couldn't be by the light of day. they're all real!
buffy: what? you, like, sent away for the time-life series?
giles: ah, w-w-w-yes.
buffy: did you get the free phone?
giles: um, the calendar.
buffy: cool! but, okay,
scene direction: buffy gives back the books
buffy: first of all, i'm a vampire slayer. and secondly, i'm retired. hey, i know! why don't you kill 'em?
giles: i-i'm a watcher, i-i haven't the skill...
buffy: oh, come on, stake through the heart, a little sunlight... it's like falling off a log.
giles: a, a slayer slays, a watcher...
buffy: ...watches?
giles: yes. no!
scene direction: giles sets down the books
giles: he, he trains her, he, he, he prepares her...
buffy: prepares me for what? for getting kicked out of school? for losing all of my friends? for having to spend all of my time fighting for my life and never getting to tell anyone because i might endanger them? go ahead! prepare me.
scene direction: they just look at each other for a moment. buffy exhales, turns and leaves the library in disgust. giles hesitates for an instant.
scene direction: giles to himself
giles: damn!
scene direction: he runs after buffy. xander walks out from behind the stacks.
xander: what?
scene change: cut to the hall. giles catches up with buffy.
giles: it's getting worse!
buffy: what's getting worse?
scene direction: he guides her over to the wall and speaks with her in a low voice.
giles: the influx of the undead, the... supernatural occurrences, it's been building for years. there's a reason why you're here and a reason why it's now!
buffy: because now is the time my mom moved here.
scene direction: she tries to evade him, but he puts his arm out to stop her.
giles: something's coming, something, something... something is, is gonna happen here. soon!
buffy: gee, can you vague that up for me?
giles: the signs, as far as i can tell, point to a crucial mystical upheaval, very soon. days. possibly less.
buffy: oh, come on! this is sunnydale! how bad an evil can there be here?
scene change: cut to outside the school. the camera descends behind some bushes and sinks through the ground into the lair of the master. there are candles everywhere. vampires bearing torches are gathering. the camera moves around the lair as luke speaks and eventually comes to rest on him.
luke: the sleeper will wake. the sleeper will wake. the sleeper will wake. the sleeper will wake, and the world will bleed. amen!
scene change: *** part 3 ***
scene direction: buffy's room. she's considering what to wear to the bronze. she holds a shiny black outfit up to the mirror.
buffy: hi! i'm an enormous slut!
scene direction: buffy holds up a blue floral dress
buffy: hello! would you like a copy of 'the watchtower'?
scene direction: buffy lowers the dress
buffy: i used to be so good at this.
scene direction: her mother comes into the room.
joyce: hi, hon.
scene direction: buffy returns her dresses to the closet.
buffy: hey!
joyce: are you, uh, going out tonight?
buffy: yeah, i'm going to a club.
joyce: oh. will there be boys there?
buffy: no, mom. it's a nun club.
joyce: well, just be careful.
buffy: i will.
joyce: you know, i think we can make it work here. i've got my positive energy flowing... i'm gonna get the gallery on its feet... oh, uh, we may have found a space today.
buffy: that's great.
joyce: oh, and that school is a, a very nurturing environment, which is just what you need.
buffy: well, actually...
joyce: oh, not too nurturing. i know, you're sixteen, i've read all about the dangers of over-nurturing.
scene direction: buffy goes to her bed and lays out a couple of outfits.
joyce: it's hard. new town and everything... it is for me, too. i'm trying to make it work.
scene direction: joyce takes her daughter's hands in hers
joyce: i'm going to make it work.
buffy: i know.
joyce: oh, you're a good girl, buffy,
scene direction: joyce pats her on the head
joyce: you just fell in with the wrong crowd. but that is all behind us now.
buffy: it is. from now on i am only going to hang out with the living.
scene direction: buffy they let go of their hands, and she picks up her dresses
buffy: i mean, lively. people.
scene direction: buffy heads back to her closet with an awkward look on her face.
joyce: hmm. okay. you have fun.
scene direction: cut outside later that evening. buffy is walking down a dark street, when someone appears behind her. she senses that she is being followed.
scene direction: after walking for a ways, when she gets a chance she ducks down an alley and looks around for a place to hide. a cat yowls and kicks some cans as it runs away. she spies something above her. angel comes into the alley but doesn't see her. as he slowly walks along, the camera pulls up to reveal buffy in a handstand on a bar high above the pavement. when angel has passed underneath her, she swings down and kicks him in the back. he is knocked to the ground, and buffy positions herself above him with a foot on his chest.
angel: ah, heh. is there a problem, ma'am?
buffy: yeah, there's a problem. why are you following me?
angel: i know what you're thinking. don't worry, i don't bite.
scene direction: she backs off and lets him get up, but keeps her fighting stance.
angel: truth is, i thought you'd be taller, or bigger muscles and all that. you're pretty spry, though.
scene direction: angel massages his neck
buffy: what do you want?
angel: the same thing you do.
scene direction: buffy lets down her guard
buffy: okay. what do i want?
scene direction: angel steps toward her
angel: to kill them. to kill them all.
buffy: sorry, that's incorrect. but you do get this lovely watch and a year's supply of turtle wax. what i want is to be left alone!
scene direction: she starts a determined walk away.
angel: do you really think that's an option anymore? you're standing at the mouth of hell. and it's about to open.
scene direction: she stops, turns to him and looks at him with a wide-eyed gaze. he reaches into his jacket and pulls out a small box.
angel: don't turn your back on this.
scene direction: angel tosses her the box
angel: you've gotta be ready.
buffy: what for?
angel: for the harvest.
buffy: who are you?
angel: let's just say... i'm a friend.
scene direction: angel starts to leave
buffy: yeah, well, maybe i don't want a friend.
scene direction: angel turns back
angel: i didn't say i was yours.
scene direction: he leaves. buffy stares after him for a moment, then opens the box. it contains a silver cross and chain. she takes it out, holds it in her hand and takes another glance in his direction.
scene change: cut to outside the bronze. people are arriving and meeting. buffy is wearing the cross around her neck. she walks up to the entrance, gives the doorman some cash and goes in. sprung monkey is playing "believe" loudly, and the dance floor is crowded with people.
lyrics: oh, i just want to believe / can you hear me? / can you see me? / what's inside of me? / oh, i just want to believe / if my life can have a purpose / help me to believe / oh, i just want to believe / can you hear me? / can you see me? / what's inside of me? / oh, i just want to believe / if my life can have a purpose / help me to believe.
scene direction: buffy moves to the music a bit. she sees a guy waving in her direction and waves back, then notices someone behind her waving back and pulls her hand down, embarrassed.
lyrics: everybody wants to find the circle / the line of truth that has no end / because so many nights i've slept with the feeling of empty / and i say, right now i'm ready to believe.
scene direction: she finds the bar and sees willow sitting there.
buffy: hey!
willow: oh, hi!
scene direction: buffy walks around her and sits on the stool next to her. willow turns to face her.
willow: hi!
buffy: oh, you're here with someone?
willow: no, i'm just here. i thought xander was gonna show up.
buffy: oh, are you guys going out?
willow: no, we're just friends. we used to go out, but we broke up.
buffy: how come?
willow: he stole my barbie.
scene direction: willow buffy looks confused
willow: oh, we were five.
buffy: oh.
willow: i-i-i don't actually date a whole lot... lately.
buffy: why not?
willow: well, when i'm with a boy i like, it's hard for me to say anything cool, or, or witty, or at all. i-i can usually make a few vowel sounds, and then i have to go away.
buffy: it's not *that* bad!
willow: no, i-it is. i think boys are more interested in a girl who can talk.
buffy: you really *haven't* been dating lately.
willow: it's probably easy for you.
buffy: yeah, real easy.
willow: i-i mean you don't seem too shy.
buffy: well, my philosophy, do you wanna hear my philosophy?
willow: yeah, i do!
buffy: life is short.
willow: life is short!
buffy: not original, i'll grant you, but it's true. you know? why waste time being all shy and worrying about some guy, and if he's gonna laugh at you. seize the moment, 'cause tomorrow you might be dead.
willow: oh, that's nice!
scene direction: buffy looks up and sees giles on the upper level.
buffy: um, i'll be back in a minute.
scene direction: buffy gets up to go
willow: oh, tha-that's okay, you don't have to come back.
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: i'll be back in a minute.
scene direction: willow to herself
willow: seize the moment.
scene change: cut to buffy, making her way to the stairs. the camera follows her up.
lyrics: i feel love with my friends / i feel love in my songs / if i could just hold love / then all the answers might come / i said, oh, if we're all children of god / and we just turned away / i got a lack of belief / i said a world without faith / it's time we turn back around.
scene direction: buffy finds giles
buffy: so, you like to party with the students. isn't that kinda skanky?
giles: oh, right, this is me having fun. watching... clown hair prance about is hardly my idea of a party. i'd much rather be at home with a cup of bovril and a good book.
buffy: you need a personality, stat!
scene direction: giles points to the crowd below
giles: this is a perfect breeding ground for vampire activity. it's dark, it's crowded... besides, i knew you were likely to show up, and i have to make you understand...
buffy: ...that the harvest is coming. i know, your friend told me.
giles: what did you say?
buffy: the harvest. that mean something to you? 'cause i'm drawing a blank.
giles: i'm not sure. uh... w-who told you this?
buffy: this... guy. dark, gorgeous in an annoying sort of way. i figured you two were buds.
giles: no. the harvest. did he say anything else?
buffy: something about the mouth of hell. i *really* didn't like him!
scene direction: the band has finished its song and there's lots of applause. they soon start their next song, "swirl". giles moves around buffy, leans on the railing and looks down at the crowd.
giles: look at them, throwing themselves about, completely unaware of the danger that surrounds them.
buffy: lucky them.
giles: or perhaps you're right. perhaps there is no trouble coming, the signs could be wrong. it's not as though you've been having the nightmares.
scene change: buffy is silent. cut to below.
cordelia: my mom doesn't even *get* out of bed anymore. and the doctor says it's epstein-barr. i'm like, pleeease! it's chronic hepatitis, or at least chronic fatigue syndrome. i mean, *nobody* cool has epstein-barr anymore.
scene direction: jesse spots cordelia and comes over.
jesse: hey, cordelia!
cordelia: oh, yay, it's my stalker.
scene direction: cordelia makes a face
jesse: hey, you, uh, you look great!
cordelia: well, i'm glad we had this little chat.
scene direction: jesse coughs
jesse: listen, uh, you know, you wanna dance, you know?
cordelia: with you?
jesse: well, uh, yeah.
cordelia: well, uh, no! c'mon, guys.
scene direction: she and her friends leave. jesse is left in the dust.
jesse: fine! plenty of other fish in the sea. oh, yeah, i'm... on the prowl. witness me prowling!
scene change: cut to buffy and giles on the upper level.
buffy: i didn't say i'd never slay another vampire. it's not like i have all these fluffy bunny feelings for them, i'm just not gonna get way extracurricular with it. you know, if i see one, sure i'll...
scene direction: giles interrupting
giles: will you be ready? there's so much you don't know about them, about your own powers. a vampire appears to be completely normal until the feed is upon them, only then do they reveal their true demonic visage.
buffy: you're like a textbook with arms, i know this.
giles: the point is, a slayer should be able to see them anyway. without looking, without thinking. can you tell me if there's a vampire in this building?
buffy: maybe...
giles: you should know. even through this mass and this... din, you should be able to sense them. well, try! reach out with your mind.
scene direction: giles buffy looks around
giles: you have to hone your senses, focus until the energy washes over you, until you, you feel every particle o-of...
buffy: there's one.
giles: w-where?
buffy: right there, talking to that girl.
giles: you don't know...
buffy: oh, please! look at his jacket. he's got the sleeves rolled up, and the shirt! deal with that outfit for a moment.
giles: it's dated?
buffy: it's carbon dated. trust me, only someone living underground for ten years would think that was still the look.
giles: but you didn't... hone.
scene direction: buffy notices that the girl is willow
buffy: oh, no.
giles: isn't that...
buffy: willow.
giles: what's she doing?
buffy: seizing the moment!
scene direction: she starts down to rescue willow.
lyrics: we're formed in liquid / pushed out still dripping / a world was thrown before my eyes.
scene change: cut to below. willow is being led out of the bronze by the vampire. cut to giles. he's at a loss for what to do.
lyrics: now paint a picture / crayon stick figures / with blue-haired people, purple skies.
scene change: cut to below. buffy has lost them. she tries the back. she breaks a leg off of a stack of chairs and begins to stalk. after a while cordelia comes out of the restroom and surprises her. buffy reacts, taking cordelia by the throat and pushing her up against a wall.

buffy: cordelia!
scene direction: buffy she lets go
cordelia: god! what is your childhood trauma?!
scene direction: her entourage appears in the restroom door behind her.
buffy: have you guys seen willow? did she come by here?
cordelia: why? do you need to attack her with the stick? jeez!

cordelia: excuse me, i have to call *everyone* i have *ever* met, right now.
scene change: cut to the main floor. giles catches up with buffy.
giles: that *was* quick. well done! i-i need to go to the library. this harvest thing...
buffy: i didn't find them!
scene direction: he grabs buffy by the arm and turns her to face him.
giles: the vampire is not dead?
buffy: no, but my social life is on the critical list.
scene direction: giles lets go of her
giles: so, what do we do?
buffy: i'll take care of it!
giles: i-i-i need to come with you, yes?
buffy: don't worry. one vampire i can handle.
scene direction: she leaves, walking past jesse talking to darla.
jesse: so, um, what did you say your name was?
darla: darla.
jesse: darla. you know, i haven't seen you around before. are you from around here?
darla: no, but i have family here.
jesse: have i met them?
darla: you probably will.
scene change: cut to the master's lair. the master rises out of the pool of blood as luke kneels and looks on. he steps out of the pool over to luke and offers his hand. luke takes it.
luke: master!
scene change: *** part 4 ***
scene direction: in the master's lair.

scene change: cut to the sidewalk next to the cemetery. willow and thomas are walking.
willow: sure is dark.
thomas: it's night.
willow: well, that's a dark time, night. traditionally. i still can't believe i've never seen you at school. do you have mr. chomsky for history?
scene direction: thomas ignores her babbling and heads into the cemetery.
willow: uh, the ice cream bar is this way. it's past hamilton street?
thomas: i know a shortcut.
scene direction: he grabs her hand and leads her into the cemetery.
scene change: cut to outside the bronze. buffy is trying to find willow.
xander: hey, you're leaving already?
buffy: oh, xander! have you seen willow?
xander: not tonight, no.
buffy: she left with a guy.
xander: we're talking about willow, right? scorin' at the bronze, work it girl...
buffy: no, i need to find her. where would he take her?
xander: why? oh, hey, i hope he's not a vampire, because then you might have to slay him.
scene direction: buffy taken aback
buffy: was there a... a school bulletin? was it i-in the newspaper? is there anyone in this town who doesn't know i'm the slayer?
xander: no. i only know that you *think* that you're the slayer, and the reason why i know that...
buffy: well, whatever, it doesn't matter, just tell me, where would willow go?
xander: you're serious!
buffy: we don't find her and there's gonna be one more dead body in the morning!
scene change: cut to the cemetery. willow and thomas are walking.
willow: oh, okay, th-this is nice... and scary. are you sure this is faster?

scene direction: willow turns away
thomas: come on.
scene direction: thomas comes up behind her and pulls her hair back
thomas: what are you afraid of?
scene change: he moves in toward her neck. she lets out a yelp as he grabs her and pushes her into the mausoleum. cut to inside the mausoleum. willow trips down the stairs and stops up against the stone coffin. she turns around.
willow: that wasn't funny!

scene direction: she trips over some stones.
willow: i think i'm gonna go.
thomas: is that what you think?
scene direction: he comes toward her again. she skirts by him, but only because he lets her. darla blocks her way out of the mausoleum.
darla: is this the best you could do?
thomas: she's fresh!
darla: hardly enough to share.
thomas: why didn't you bring your own?
scene direction: darla gives him a look
darla: i did.
scene direction: jesse stumbles into the mausoleum, holding his neck.
jesse: hey! wait up!
willow: oh, my god, jesse!
scene direction: he is weak from blood loss and collapses. willow tries to catch him and breaks his fall.
jesse: y'know, you gave me a hickey.
scene direction: thomas gives darla a look.
scene direction: darla shrugs
darla: i got hungry on the way.
willow: jesse, let's get outta here!
darla: oh, you're not going anywhere.
willow: leave us alone!
darla: you're not going anywhere until we've
scene direction: darla vamps out
darla: *fed*!
scene direction: willow screams and falls back down next to jesse. buffy and xander show up.
buffy: well, this is nice. i-it's a little bare, but a dash of paint, a few throw pillows... call it home!
scene direction: buffy moves behind the coffin to draw the vampires away from the others.
darla: who the hell are you?
buffy: you mean there's actually someone in this town who doesn't know already? whew, that's a relief, i'm telling you! having a secret identity in this town is a job of work.
xander: buffy, we bail now, right?
thomas: not yet!
buffy: okay, first of all, what's with the outfit? live in the now, okay? you look like debarge!
scene direction: the vampires close in on her. she turns to darla.

darla: that's fine with me!
buffy: are you sure? now, this in not gonna be pretty. we're talking violence, strong language, adult content...
scene direction: thomas roars behind buffy. she pulls the chair leg out from inside her shirt. he attacks from behind, but buffy neatly jams the makeshift stake into his chest. he falls back and turns to ashes. darla can't believe her eyes. neither can anyone else.

buffy: you know, i just wanted to start over. be like everybody else. have some friends, y'know, maybe a dog... but, no, you had to come here, you couldn't go suck on some other town.
darla: who are you?
buffy: don't you know?

luke: i don't care!
scene direction: he throws her across the room. he grabs darla and lifts her to her feet.
luke: you were supposed to be bringing an offering for the master! we're almost at harvest, and you dally with this child!
darla: we had someone, but then she came. she killed thomas. luke, she's strong.
luke: you go. i'll see if i can handle the little girl.
scene direction: he approaches buffy as she starts to get up, still a little dazed. darla quickly climbs the steps, looks back once and runs out of the door. luke attacks buffy with a double punch, but she blocks it and delivers a punch to his gut and a hopping front snap kick to his jaw. he steps back, but isn't fazed.
luke: you're strong.

scene direction: she backs away up the stairs toward the exit.

luke: you think you can stop me? stop us?
scene direction: he grabs the stake with his other hand and breaks it. then he grabs her by the shirt.
luke: you have no idea what you're dealing with.
scene direction: he throws buffy onto the rim of the now open coffin. she rolls off onto the floor, dazed. luke gets up and starts toward her, quoting scripture.
luke: 'and like a plague of boils, the race of man covered the earth.' cut to the library. giles is paging through an old volume and stops on a picture of satan with lightning coming from his hand to a man's.
luke: 'but on the third day of the newest light would come the harvest.
scene change: and the blood of men will flow as wine.' cut to the master sitting in an intricately carved chair.
luke: 'when the master will walk among them once more!' cut to xander, willow and jesse surrounded by vampires, including darla.
luke: 'the earth will belong to the old ones.' cut to buffy. luke is in her face.
luke: 'and hell itself will come to town.' he grabs buffy and growls. he lifts her by the throat and throws her toward the coffin. buffy does a front layout and lands in the coffin next to a skeleton, and lets out a quick scream, but then remains silent, only breathing. she can't see or hear luke. she slowly starts to get up. suddenly luke jumps up and into the coffin.
