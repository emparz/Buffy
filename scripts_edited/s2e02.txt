scene direction: the cemetery. buffy is sitting on top of the gravestone of stephan korshak playing with her yo-yo.
buffy: c'mon, stephan, rise and shine. some of us have a ton of trig homework waiting.
scene direction: the camera cuts to her right and approaches her from behind.
angel: hey.
scene direction: buffy inhales a quick startled breath and turns around to face her stalker.
angel: is this a bad time?
buffy: are you crazy? you don't just sneak up on people in a graveyard. you make noise when you walk. you stomp or... yodel.
angel: i heard you were on the hunt.
buffy: i'm supposed to be, but... lazy bones here doesn't wanna come out and play.
angel: when you first wake up it's a little disorienting. he'll show.
buffy: it's weird to think of you going through that.
angel: it's weird to go through. so, uh, you're here alone?
buffy: yeah! why?
angel: i just thought you'd have somebody with you. xander or someone.
buffy: xander.
angel: or someone.
buffy: nope.
scene direction: buffy hops down off the gravestone
buffy: why? are you jealous?
scene direction: angel chuckles
angel: of xander? please. he's just a kid.
buffy: is it 'cause i danced with him?
angel: 'danced with' is a pretty loose term. 'mated with' might be a little closer.
buffy: don't you think you're being a little unfair? it was one little dance, which i only did to make you crazy, by the way. behold my success.
angel: i am *not* jealous.
buffy: you're not jealous? what, vampires don't get jealous?
scene direction: stephan has come out of the ground, and looks at them from behind his gravestone.
angel: see? whenever we fight you always bring up the vampire thing.
buffy: well, i didn't come here to fight.
scene direction: the vampire lunges at her and knocks her into angel. they fall to the ground, but buffy quickly gets up.
buffy: oh, right, i did.
scene direction: stephan throws a few punches which buffy easily blocks. she punches him in the face several times and kicks him in the jaw, sending him stumbling into a large adjacent gravestone. she looks around frantically.
buffy: where's my stake? i-i know i had a stake!
angel: i didn't see a stake!
scene direction: the vampire grabs a shovel that was lying by the other gravestone and comes at them again. angel attacks, but stephan brings the shovel up and hits him in the side of the face, knocking him onto his back. he leaves angel lying there and steps toward buffy. she meets him and jumps over the shovel when stephan swings it at her legs. he swings it at her again, but she catches it, hits him again and breaks the handle. she spins around with her half and jams the broken handle into his chest. he falls over backward and bursts into ashes as he hits the ground. angel gets upholding the side of his head.
scene direction: buffy out of breath
buffy: what do you mean he's just a kid? does that mean i'm just a kid, too?
angel: look, obviously i made a mistake coming here tonight.
scene direction: angel turns and leaves
buffy: oh, no you don't. you can't just turn and walk away from me like that.
scene direction: buffy starts following him determinedly
buffy: it takes more than that to get rid of me.
scene direction: she falls into an open grave with an open and empty coffin at the bottom.
buffy: oof! uhhh...
scene direction: angel comes over and bends down to look.
angel: you okay?
buffy: i'm fine.
scene direction: buffy sits up and exhales
buffy: gee, i wish people wouldn't leave open graves lying around like this.
scene direction: buffy stands up slowly
angel: so. another vampire has risen tonight.
scene direction: she pokes her head out of the grave and looks across the grass.
buffy: i don't think so. look at those tracks. whoever was buried here didn't rise from this grave.
scene direction: she climbs out of the grave and finds a girl's shoe.
buffy: she was dragged from it.
scene direction: opening credits roll. buffy's theme plays.
scene change: *** part 1 ***
scene change: sunnydale high school. cut to the library. buffy and xander walk in and see giles sitting in a chair and talking to another empty chair across from him.
scene direction: giles clears his throat
giles: w-w-w-what i'm proposing is, um... and i-i don't mean to appear indecorous, is, is, um, a, a-a-a social engagement, um, a, a, a, a-a date, if you're amenable.
scene direction: buffy and xander stop and listen to him. giles is displeased with himself.
giles: you idiot!
buffy: boy...
scene direction: giles is startled and quickly gets up and faces them.
buffy: i guess we never realized how much you like that chair.
giles: i-i-i was just working on...
scene direction: giles knocks over a few books
buffy: your pickup lines?
scene direction: giles bends down
giles: um, in a manner of speaking, yes.
scene direction: giles picks up the books
buffy: then if you wouldn't mind a little gene and roger, you might wanna leave off the 'idiot' part. being called an idiot tends to take people out of the dating mood.
xander: hmm, it actually kinda turns me on.
scene direction: xander looks at buffy
scene direction: buffy to xander
buffy: i fear you.
scene direction: buffy goes to the table
buffy: you also might wanna avoid words like 'amenable' and 'indecorous', y'know. speak english, not whatever they speak in, um...
giles: england?
buffy: yeah. you just say, 'hey, i got a thing, you maybe have a thing, maybe we could have a thing.' giles:
scene direction: buffy sarcastically
buffy: oh, thank you, cyrano.
buffy: i'm not finished. then you say, 'how do you feel about mexican?' giles: about mexicans?
buffy: mexican. food. you take her for food, for which you then pay.
scene direction: buffy sits at the table
giles: oh. right.
xander: so this chair-woman. we are talking ms. calendar, right?
giles: w-what makes you think that?
scene direction: xander sits
xander: simple deduction. ms. calendar is reasonably dollsome, especially for someone in your age bracket. she already knows that you're a school librarian, so you don't have to worry about how to break that embarrassing news to her.
buffy: and she's the only woman we've actually ever seen speak to you. add it all up and it all spells 'duh'.
xander: now, is it time to have a talk about the facts of life?
giles: you know, i'm suddenly deciding this is none of your business.
scene direction: giles starts up the stairs
xander: y'know, because that whole stork thing is a smoke screen.
scene direction: giles stops and looks back at him. buffy laughs to herself.
giles: so, um, how did things go last night? did mr. korshak show up on schedule?
buffy: more or less. angel and i took care of him.
xander: angel.
scene direction: buffy gives xander a look
buffy: there's something else, though. we found an empty grave.
giles: another vampire?
buffy: no. no, this one was dug up and the body was taken out.
giles: grave robbing? that's new. interesting.
scene direction: giles comes back down to the table
buffy: i *know* you meant to say gross and disturbing.
giles: yes, yes, yes of course. uh, terrible thing. must, must put a stop to it. damn it.
xander: so. why does someone want to dig up graves?
giles: well, i'll, uh, collect some theories. uh, it would help if we knew who the body belonged to.
buffy: meredith todd. ring a bell?
xander: no.
buffy: she died recently. she was our age.
xander: drawin' a blank.
giles: why don't we ask willow to, uh, fire
scene direction: giles indicates the pc
giles: this thing up and, uh, track meredith down?
scene change: cut to the halls. sign-ups for the science fair are going on. willow is writing in her entry. eric comes up to her with a camera and points it at her.
eric: smile!
scene direction: eric takes her picture
willow: hey!
scene direction: he turns around and sees another girl.
eric: oh, look at those legs!
scene direction: eric goes to take her picture
willow: no, thank you.
scene direction: chris comes up behind willow.
chris: eric, will you knock it off?
scene direction: eric looks at him, upset to have his fun spoiled.
scene direction: willow smiles
willow: hey, chris!
chris: hey.
scene direction: he picks up a sign-up sheet. she watches what he's writing. he looks up at her.
willow: oh, i, i was just wondering what you were gonna do this year.
chris: why?
willow: 'cause every year you win and i place second, so i just thought i'd see what i'm up against.
chris: you know what the key is? if dr. clark doesn't understand your experiment he gives you higher marks so it looks like he understands your experiment.
scene direction: chris reads willow's entry
chris: 'the effects of sub-violet light spectrum deprivation on the development of fruit flies'?
scene direction: chris smirks
chris: that should do the trick.
scene direction: cordelia shows up and signs up
cordelia: okay, i'm doing this under protest. it is not fair that they're making participation in this year's science fair mandatory. i don't think anyone should have to do anything educational in school if they don't want to.
scene direction: willow reads
willow: 'the tomato: fruit or vegetable'?
cordelia: i wanted to do something i could finish in a weekend, alright?
scene direction: eric flashes a picture of cordelia.
cordelia: stop it! what are you doing?
scene direction: cordelia eric takes another picture
cordelia: we are under florescent light, for god's sake.
eric: the camera loves you!
cordelia: i didn't think yearbook nerds came out of hibernation till spring.
scene direction: eric snaps another picture
eric: it's for my private collection.
scene direction: eric winks
chris: eric! will you quit it?
buffy: comin' through. sorry.
scene direction: buffy eric takes her picture
buffy: uh, sorry to interrupt, willow, but it's the bat signal.
willow: okay, sure. see you later, chris. thanks for the tip.
chris: okay.
scene direction: cordelia watches them go. eric raises his eyebrows at her.
scene direction: cordelia disgusted
cordelia: uhhh!
scene direction: cordelia leaves
eric: cordelia's so fine. y'know, she'd be just perfect for us.
chris: don't be an idiot. she's alive.
scene change: cut to the library. willow sits down in front of the pc.
willow: this shouldn't take long. i'm probably the only girl in school who has the coroner's office bookmarked as a favorite place.
scene direction: cordelia coming in
cordelia: hi. sorry to interrupt your little undead playgroup, but i need to ask willow if she'll help me with my science fair project.
willow: it's a fruit.
cordelia: i would've asked chris to help me, but then that would've brought back too many memories of daryl.
willow: i found it! meredith todd died in a car accident last week.
cordelia: of course i have learned to deal with my pain.
buffy: how was her neck?
willow: fine, except for being broken.
scene direction: giles comes out of his office.
cordelia: hello! can we deal with my pain, please?
giles: there, there.
scene direction: he pats her on the shoulder and continues up into the stacks.
willow: it says that meredith and two other girls in the car were killed instantly. they were all on the fondren high pep squad, on the way to a game.
buffy: you know what this means.
xander: that fondren might actually beat sunnydale in the cross-town body count competition this year?
buffy: she wasn't killed by vampires. somebody did dig up her corpse.
cordelia: eww! why is it that every conversation you people have has the word 'corpse' in it?
xander: okay, so we got a body snatcher. what does that mean?
giles: uh, h-here's what i've come up with. demons who eat the flesh of the dead to absorb their souls. or, i-i-it could obviously be a, a voodoo practitioner.
willow: you mean making a zombie?
giles: uh, zombies, more likely. for most traditional purposes a voodoo priest would require more than one.
buffy: so, we should see if the other girls from the accident are awol, too. maybe we can figure out what this creep has in mind if we know whether or not he's dealing in volume.
xander: so, we dig up some graves tonight?
willow: oh, boy! a field trip! are you gonna call angel?
buffy: i don't think so.
xander: yeah, why bother him, huh?
buffy: angel and i have been, um... never mind. as far as angel's concerned, i'm taking the night off, okay?
xander: so, we're set then. say, nine-ish? byo shovel?
willow: and i'll pack some food. who else likes those little powdered doughnuts?
xander: me.
willow: cordelia?
cordelia: darn, i have cheerleader practice tonight. boy, i wish i knew we were gonna be digging up dead people sooner. i would've canceled.
xander: alright, but if you come across the army of zombies, can you page us before they eat your flesh?
scene direction: cordelia huffs and leaves the library.
giles: xander?
xander: huh?
giles: zombies don't eat the flesh of the living.
xander: yeah, i knew that. but did you see the look on her face?
scene change: cut to the cemetery that night. giles and xander are digging while buffy and willow relax and watch.
buffy: i couldn't believe angel. he was acting all jealous, and he wouldn't even admit it.
willow: jealous of what?
buffy: of xander.
willow: because you did that sexy dance with him?
buffy: am i ever gonna live that down?
willow: no.
scene direction: willow munches a doughnut
buffy: anyway, he was being totally irrational.
willow: love makes you do the wacky.
buffy: that's the truth.
xander: y'know, this might go a lot faster if you femmes actually picked up a shovel, too.
giles: here, here.
buffy: sorry, but i'm an old-fashioned gal. i was raised to believe that men dig up the corpses and the women have the babies.
scene direction: buffy to willow
buffy: so, speaking of the wacky, what was cordelia's whole riff about painful memories? who's daryl?
willow: daryl epps. chris' older brother. he was a big football star. all-state two years ago. he was a running... he was a running... uh, someone who runs and catches.
buffy: was he studly?
willow: big time. all of the girls were crazy for him.
buffy: and he broke cordy's heart? thus possibly proving its existence.
willow: he died. rock climbing or something? he fell.
buffy: man, that's lousy. poor chris.
willow: ever since then chris has been real quiet. kind of in his own world. i heard their mother doesn't even leave the house anymore.
giles: i think we're there.
scene direction: buffy and willow get up and go over to the grave.
willow: by the way, are we hoping to find a body, or no body?
xander: call me an optimist, but i'm hoping to find a fortune in gold doubloons.
giles: um, body would mean flesh-eating demon, no body would point towards the, uh, army of zombies thing. take your pick, really. right, then, uh...
scene direction: giles to xander
giles: go on.
scene direction: giles indicates the casket
xander: you're closer.
buffy: pathetic much?
scene direction: buffy climbs down
buffy: move over.
scene direction: she opens the casket.
scene change: cut to the school after cheerleading practice. the cheerleaders are heading home.
cordelia: guys, if we don't get this down by tomorrow, no one's gonna be led by our cheers. practice.
girl: okay. see ya later.
scene direction: cordelia continues on to her own car as the others get in theirs. they drive off before cordelia reaches her car. she hears something by the fence and stops to look around.
cordelia: hello?
scene direction: she continues to her car and starts to dig in her pack for her keys. she gets them out and runs the rest of the way to her car. she nervously fumbles with the lock.
cordelia: xander harris, if this is some kind of joke...
scene direction: she drops her keys and they roll under the car. she kneels down and reaches for them frantically. on the other side of her car she can see someone in black shoes approaching. she quickly gets up and starts to run. the man follows her. he walks past a dumpster. when he's gone the lid opens, and cordelia checks to see if the coast is clear. she pushes the lid up all the way, then turns around again to hop out, but is startled by angel.
angel: cordelia. this is the last place i expected you to hang out.
scene direction: cordelia quietly
cordelia: oh, god! god, it's you. why were you following me?
angel: i wasn't sure it was you at first. i'm looking for buffy.
cordelia: buffy? well, she's, uh... big shock, she's at the graveyard.
angel: she said she'd be home.
cordelia: well, she lied. isn't she a rascal? well, you're in luck. it just so happens that my night is free.
scene direction: cordelia tries to get out
cordelia: uh, hold on, my skirt is caught.
scene direction: she reaches behind her and gets her skirt loose.
cordelia: there.
scene direction: she picks up what was holding her skirt and sees it's a hand. she drops it and screams.
scene change: *** part 2 ***
scene direction: the library. xander can be heard outside in the hall.
xander: so, both coffins are empty. that makes three girls signed up for the army of zombies.
scene direction: they come in through the doors.
willow: is it an army if you just have three?
scene direction: angel gets up from the table and faces them. cordelia clings to his arm and gets up, too.
buffy: zombie drill team then.
angel: you're back.
buffy: angel!
angel: xander.
xander: angel.
scene direction: angel to buffy
angel: i thought you were takin' the night off.
buffy: i, i was, um, but something came up.
angel: cordelia told me the truth.
scene direction: xander chuckles
xander: that's gotta be a first.
giles: um, as long as you're here, perhaps you could be of some help. hmm?
scene direction: giles to buffy
giles: hmm?
buffy: we were investigating. somebody's been digging up the bodies of dead girls.
angel: i know. we found some of them.
buffy: you mean, like, two of the three?
angel: i mean, like, some of them. like parts.
cordelia: it was horrible. angel saved me from an arm. god, there were so many parts, they were everywhere. why are these terrible things always happening to me?
xander: karma!
scene direction: xander coughs to cover it
willow: so much for our zombie theory.
giles: so much for all our theories.
buffy: i don't get it. why go to all the trouble to dig up three girls only to chop them up and throw them away? it doesn't make any sense. especially from a time management standpoint.
angel: well, what i saw didn't add up to three whole girls. i think they kept some parts.
buffy: could this get yuckier?
willow: they probably kept the other parts to eat.
buffy: question answered.
giles: why dispose of the remains five miles from the cemetery at a school, of all places?
buffy: maybe because whoever did it had some business in the neighborhood. like, say, classes?
giles: oh. ah.
angel: this was no hatchet job. whoever made those incisions really knew what they were doing.
scene direction: giles disbelieving
giles: yes, really. what student here is gonna be that well versed in physiology?
willow: well, i can think of five or six guys in the science club. and me.
xander: so, will, come clean. promise to never do it again, and we'll call it a night.
scene direction: xander no response
xander: he joked!
scene direction: xander smiles
buffy: willow, why don't you get these guys' locker numbers so we can do some checking?
cordelia: no. i have to go home now. i have to take a bath and burn my clothes.
scene direction: xander in mock disappointment
xander: you have to go? aw, too bad. keep in touch. buh-bye.
cordelia: i don't wanna go alone. i'm still fragile.
scene direction: cordelia to angel
cordelia: can you take me?
scene direction: angel is in open-mouthed shock, and looks at buffy. she gives him a stare of disapproval.
cordelia: great! i'll drive?
scene direction: she leads the way out of the library as angel gives buffy another helpless look.
xander: how about that? i always pegged him as a one-woman vampire.
scene change: cut to chris' house. his mother is sitting in front of the tv watching videos of daryl's games. his trophy sits on top of the tv. chris comes out of the basement.
chris: i'm going out, mom.
scene direction: she doesn't even look up. she just blows out another lungful of cigarette smoke. chris walks over to the front door.
chris: i'll be back later, okay? mom?
scene direction: still no response. she takes another drag from her cigarette. chris lets out a sigh of frustration and leaves the house. on the video daryl just scored a touchdown, and the team is holding him up high as the cheerleaders jump and wave their pompoms.
video: dar-yl! dar-yl! dar-yl! dar-yl! dar-yl!
scene direction: daryl takes his helmet off and holds his fists up in the air, laughing and enjoying the moment.
scene change: cut to the halls at school. xander is working a locker combination from a list. giles comes down the other hall.
giles: you understand, in my capacity as school official, this search is completely unauthorized, and i, i cannot condone it.
buffy: fine, your butt's covered. wanna grab a locker?
scene direction: buffy hands him a sheet
giles: uh, yes, yes, of course.
scene direction: giles takes the sheet
scene direction: buffy approaches a locker
buffy: okay, eric. let's see what's on your annoying little mind.
scene direction: willow at another locker
willow: nothing in here but back issues of scientific american. ooo, i haven't read this one!
scene direction: willow starts to read
giles: nothing remarkable here.
scene direction: xander opens one
xander: guys!
scene direction: they all go over to see.
xander: your friend chris epps' locker.
scene direction: willow reads off book titles
willow: 'grey's anatomy', 'mortician's desk reference', 'robicheaux's guide to muscles and tendons'.
scene direction: giles reaches in and pulls out a newspaper folded open to a picture of the three cheerleaders. the title above the picture reads 'tragic accident kills three'.
giles: i think it's fair to say chris is involved.
xander: he's into corpses alright, but we still don't know why.
buffy: yes, we do.
scene direction: she opens eric's locker door and shows them a collage of a woman made from parts of various pictures.
scene change: cut to chris' basement. eric sings while chris works on a body.
eric: i guess you'll say / what can make me feel this way? / my girl / talkin' 'bout my girl / my girl... how's my baby?
chris: she's not your baby.
eric: she's not gonna be anybody's baby if we don't finish her soon.
chris: i'm working on it.
eric: so am i, friend. so am i.
scene direction: he hangs up freshly developed pictures of buffy, willow and cordelia to dry.
scene change: cut to the balcony. buffy comes up to willow and xander sitting on the railing.
xander: any sign of our suspects?
buffy: not yet. i don't get it. why would anybody wanna make a girl?
xander: you mean when there's so many pre-made ones just lying around? the things we do for love.
buffy: love has nothing to do with this.
xander: maybe not, but i'll tell you this: people don't fall in love with what's right in front of them.
scene direction: willow gives buffy a sad, knowing look.
xander: people want the dream. what they can't have.
scene direction: willow looks over at xander longingly. buffy understands only too well.
xander: the more unattainable, the more attractive.
scene direction: willow hops down from her perch.
willow: and for eric the unattainable would include everyone. that's alive.
scene direction: she walks around xander to head down the stairs. buffy joins her.
buffy: uh, eric's sick enough to do something like this, but what about chris? he seems like a human person.
scene direction: xander follows them.
willow: i dunno. that thing with his brother was really hard on him. and he talked about death a lot. maybe he just wanted to get one-up on it.
buffy: but it's not doable. i mean, making someone from scraps, actually making them live.
willow: if it is, my science project's definitely coming in second this year.
scene direction: xander spots giles
xander: and speaking of love...
willow: we were talking about the re-animation of dead tissue.
xander: do i deconstruct your segues?
scene direction: buffy to giles
buffy: hey.
scene direction: giles distracted
giles: oh! yes. hello.
buffy: still no sign of our mad doctors?
giles: what? oh! uh, corpses, yes. evil. huh. very good.
scene direction: they see jenny stop and talk to a student.
jenny: did you bring it?
scene direction: jenny the student shakes his head
jenny: tomorrow.
student: i forgot it.
giles: very, very good.
buffy: okay, giles, just remember, 'i feel a thing, you feel a thing...' but personalize it.
giles: personalize it?
buffy: she's a technopagan, right? ask her to bless your laptop.
scene direction: buffy starts to leave
buffy: have fun.
scene direction: willow and xander smile. willow pats him on the shoulder and goes too.
giles: what? oh! don't...
xander: best of luck.
scene direction: xander follows the girls
giles: ...leave?
scene direction: jenny walks by
jenny: good morning, rupert.
scene direction: jenny continues without stopping
giles: uh, ms. calendar?
scene direction: jenny looks at him but keeps going
jenny: oh, no, please call me jenny. ms.
scene direction: calendar's my father.
scene direction: giles follows
giles: jenny, then.
scene direction: cut inside the halls. they walk together.
giles: you know, uh, jenny, um...
jenny: hmm?
giles: would it a-appear indecorous... uh, no, not in-in-indecorous, um...
jenny: yeah...?
giles: well, um... wha...
scene direction: giles exhales
giles: ah, ah, um...
jenny: rupert, look, i've gotta get inside and set up the lab.
giles: what, what i'm proposing is...
scene direction: the bell rings.
jenny: ah! i gotta go! sorry!
scene direction: jenny goes into her room
scene direction: giles to himself
giles: you idiot!
scene direction: jenny sticks her head back out
jenny: hey! listen, if it's important, why don't you just tell me at the game?
giles: game? oh, uh, you're going to the football game?
jenny: yeah, you seem surprised.
scene direction: jenny smiles
giles: no! no, i-i-i-i-i-i just assumed that you, you, you spent your evenings downloading incantations and, and, and casting bones.
jenny: on game night? are you nuts? you're going, too, right?
giles: oh, of course. always, always do.
jenny: so, we should just go together! look, i could pick you up after school, and we'll grab a bite to eat on the way if you like. how do you feel about mexican?
scene direction: giles nods.
jenny: good! okay! and whatever it is you wanna tell me, you can just tell me then. okay?
giles: okay! tonight, then.
scene direction: jenny smiles and goes back into her classroom.
scene direction: giles to himself
giles: that went well. i think.
scene change: cut to the science classroom. willow is looking through a book.
willow: i still don't get how chris could do it. i mean, arresting the cell deterioration is one thing, but...
xander: hello!
scene direction: xander holds up a visible head
xander: i wanna get ahead.
scene direction: willow exhales
willow: maybe an electrical current combined with an adrenaline boost.
xander: for the love of god, can somebody scratch my nose?
scene direction: buffy comes into the room
buffy: well, it's official. chris and eric didn't come to school today.
xander: that's no coincidence.
willow: maybe they finished their project.
buffy: god! what if it worked? what, what if that poor girl is walking around?
xander: poor girls, technically.
buffy: what could she be thinking?
willow: and what are they gonna do with her?
scene direction: giles comes in also
giles: i don't think we need to worry about that just yet. i spoke to a press person this morning about the remains. the police have finished sorting through them, and apparently they found three heads in the dumpster.
buffy: they only had three girls.
giles: precisely.
willow: so, they don't have the whole, uh, package?
xander: heads must be no good. huh. i found 'em attractive enough.
scene direction: xander gets looks from the girls
xander: well, obviously i'm not as sick as chris and eric.
giles: based on what the police have put together, i would say they're one step short of completing their masterpiece.
willow: one step.
scene direction: the camera pans around the visible head.
scene change: cut to chris' basement.
eric: we're running out of time. if we wait too long, the onset of atrophy in the limbs will be irreversible.
chris: we can turn up the current. that'll buy us a day, at least.
eric: we will lose the entire body if we don't attach a head soon.
chris: we have time.
eric: we don't! the crash with the girls was lucky. but we can't just keep waiting around for another lucky accident to drop a head in our laps. you know what we have to do. hell, it's just one lousy girl.
chris: i won't do it. i... i can't... kill anyone.
scene direction: chris turns to the shadows
chris: please! understand. i... i can't do that! please don't make me.
daryl: but you gave me your word. you promised me, little brother.
scene direction: daryl comes into the light
daryl: that i wouldn't be alone.
scene direction: his face is discolored and criss-crossed with stitches.
scene change: *** part 3 ***
scene direction: chris' basement.
eric: the body is perfect. and if we harvest a head tonight, she'll be ready by sunrise.
daryl: when you brought me back you promised you'd take care of me. i need this, chris. i need someone.
chris: please don't ask me to do this. don't ask me to take a life.
eric: i tried to tell him. if you take a life in order to make a life, the whole thing is a wash. no harm, no foul.
chris: maybe you could... you could go out...
daryl: no!
chris: let people know.
daryl: they can't see me. chris, you've always been smarter than me. you were always the brains. you're the only one who can help me now. third and long, seconds to go. where do you throw? where do you throw?
chris: number five. daryl's gonna drive.

daryl: thank you.
scene direction: daryl to eric
daryl: show me!
scene direction: eric shows daryl the pictures.
scene direction: daryl points
daryl: this one.
eric: ha, ha. a man of taste.
scene direction: he grabs a pair of scissors and cuts around cordelia's hair.
scene direction: eric sings
eric: my girl / talkin' 'bout my girl / my girl.
scene direction: he snips her head off.
scene change: cut to the library.
willow: i checked the obits. nothing that would make for a likely candidate.
xander: they seem kinda picky for guys who had three heads to begin with.
willow: formaldehyde.
giles: formaldehyde. yes, yes, yes, yes, of course, it accelerates neural decay in the brain cells.
willow: after a couple days they're useless. they're gonna need something really fresh.
buffy: how fresh?
willow: as fresh as possible. buffy, you don't think that they would...
buffy: i think anybody who cuts dead girls into little pieces does not get the benefit of any doubt. i wanna end this thing now.
giles: i second that.
buffy: okay, fine. you guys go to eric's, we can go to chris', and meet up.
scene direction: giles remembering
giles: oh! i'm supposed to be at the big game, i-i believe it's called.
buffy: fine. go ahead. we'll take care of this.
giles: well, yes, but shouldn't i, i-i, um...
buffy: okay, then why don't, uh, we all meet there?
giles: fine. yes.
willow: buffy? don't be too hard on chris. i mean, he's not a vampire.
buffy: no. he's just a ghoul.
scene direction: they leave the library.
scene change: cut to chris' house. his mother answers the door for buffy.
buffy: hi. um, i'm a friend of chris'. i kinda need to talk to him. uh, do you know if he's home?
scene direction: chris' mom goes back inside and sits down again. buffy comes in and closes the door.
buffy: so, is he home?
mrs. epps: westbury game. november 17, '95. daryl rushed 185 yards that night. four tds. he was mvp, and he made all-city that season.
buffy: yeah, that was a great one. um, but is chris home?
mrs. epps: i dunno. is today a school day? oh, watch! watch this move!
scene direction: daryl takes a kickoff, he sheds one, two, three defenders, and he breaks into the open field for a ninety-five yard touchdown!
scene direction: buffy sees the basement door with its 'keep out' and 'no admittance' signs.
mrs. epps: he woulda been nineteen next week.
scene direction: buffy goes over to the basement door and opens it. she quietly makes her way down the stairs. she looks around a bit, and then goes over to the table. there she finds the pictures of herself and willow. she also finds the plans for the body with cordelia's face pasted on top.
scene direction: buffy whispers
buffy: cordelia!
scene direction: daryl sneaks up behind her, but the door opens and they both look up.
scene direction: buffy quickly hops over to the open basement window and climbs out.
scene direction: daryl watches her go.
scene change: cut to the girls' locker room. cordelia is putting on her lip-gloss.
scene direction: joy, the cheerleading squad leader, walks by with lisa.
joy: cordelia. you coming?
cordelia: yeah, i'll be right out.
scene direction: she finishes putting on her lip-gloss and sees chris appear behind her in the mirror. she's startled and turns to face him.
cordelia: oh, god! chris, you scared me. what are you doing in here?
scene direction: he looks down and away from her.
cordelia: is something wrong?
scene direction: she screams as eric pulls a bag over her head and drags her off. chris just looks away.
scene change: cut to a hall. buffy comes around a corner and sees joy and lisa coming down the stairs.
buffy: joy! lisa! where's cordelia?
joy: cordelia has a game to think about. she doesn't need losers like you.
scene direction: joy tries to go
scene direction: buffy blocks her way
buffy: i'm sorry, what did you say?
scene change: cut to the locker room. eric has cordelia on the floor, trying to tie her hands. buffy comes running down the adjoining hall and stops to look into the locker room. eric sees her and gets up to defend himself. buffy comes running in and jump kicks him, knocking him down. she crouches down and pulls the bag off of cordelia's head.
buffy: are you okay?
cordelia: oh my god, buffy!
scene direction: eric gets up and runs away.
buffy: don't worry, he's gone.
cordelia: i was on my way down to the field when chris came in, and all of a sudden someone jumped me.
buffy: shh! quiet down. relax. take it easy.
scene direction: cordelia hears music
cordelia: that's the fight song. oh my god, it's time for the cheerleader pyramid at mid-field. i've gotta go.
buffy: well, are you sure you're okay to go out there?
cordelia: yeah, you don't understand, i *have* to go. i'm the apex!
scene direction: cordelia runs out
scene direction: buffy hears a noise and looks around.
buffy: chris?
scene direction: buffy walks slowly
buffy: i know what you're trying to do. you and eric. i know about the bodies from the cemetery. but you haven't hurt anyone yet.
scene direction: buffy chris steps out into the open
buffy: look, i know what it's like to lose someone that you're close to. but that's no excuse. what you're doing is wrong.
chris: i have to do this for him. he needs someone.
buffy: who, eric? he needs industrial strength therapy!
chris: he always looked out for me. stood up for me. he's all alone. everybody loved him. and now he's all alone.
buffy: who are you talking...
scene direction: buffy realizes
buffy: oh my god!
scene change: cut to chris' basement. daryl is trashing the place.
scene direction: daryl yelling
daryl: you promised me! you promised i wouldn't have to be alone!
eric: it's not too late.
scene direction: daryl comes over to him and lifts him by the shirt.
eric: nothing's changed! we can still do this! you and me. your brother's not the only one who can create life. whadaya say?
scene direction: daryl sets him down. eric takes a few deep breaths.
eric: let's go scare you up a date.
scene change: *** part 4 ***
scene direction: chris' basement. buffy and chris come in and quickly descend the stairs.
buffy: daryl! daryl? daryl!
scene direction: she takes a quick look around.
buffy: he's not here. where else could he be?
chris: but he would never go out. u-unless...
buffy: he's gonna pick up where you left off.
scene direction: she makes quick strides to get out of the basement and over to the game.
scene direction: after a moment's hesitation chris follows her.
scene change: cut to the game. cordelia is doing a cheer with the squad.
squad: go, razorbacks, go! go, team, go! go, razorbacks, go! go, team, go!
scene change: on the field the ball is snapped, thrown, caught and run in for a touchdown. the crowd goes wild. cut to jenny and giles coming from the refreshment stand. his arms are full of snacks and drinks.
jenny: i don't know what it is about football that does it for me. i mean, it lacks the, the grace of basketball, the, uh, poetry of baseball. at its best it's unadorned aggression. it's such a rugged contest.
giles: rugged. american football.
scene direction: giles laughs
scene direction: they climb into the stands.
jenny: and that's funny because?
giles: no!
scene direction: giles laughs
giles: i just think it's rather odd
scene direction: giles they sit
giles: that a nation that prides itself on its virility should feel compelled to strap on forty pounds of protective gear just in order to play rugby.
jenny: is this your normal strategy for a first date? dissing my country's national pastime?
giles: did you just say 'date'?
jenny: you noticed that, huh?
willow: hi, ms. calendar! hi, giles.
jenny: hey, guys. what's up?
willow: eric's was a bust. nothing there.
xander: yeah, nothing but a bunch of computer equipment and a pornography collection so prodigious it even scared me.
willow: did buffy get back yet?
giles: no, uh, no. uh, perhaps you should, uh, circulate nearer the field, see what you can find.
scene direction: willow and xander slip under the railing and sit in front of giles and jenny. xander reaches back and takes giles' popcorn.
xander: so, what's the score?
scene direction: giles and jenny are unhappy about them sitting right there.
scene change: cut to a view of the field from behind the spectators. the teams are getting in position for the next play. the ball is snapped. cut under the stands. daryl is crawling along, looking for cordelia. he sees the action on the field and stops a moment to watch and remember. a player on the field gets tackled, but has gained several yards and gets high- fives from his teammates. daryl lowers his eyes a moment, then notices cordelia. she takes a break from cheerleading and walks over to the coolers next to the bleachers for a drink. daryl comes up behind her as she drinks and grabs her. she screams, but her yell is drowned out by the crowd cheering another touchdown. the other cheerleaders jump and wave their pompoms. on the field the players help the scoring team member up and pat him on the back. buffy and chris arrive by the bleachers.
buffy: i don't see her. do you?
chris: no.
scene direction: buffy lets out a frustrated breath.
scene change: cut to the old science lab at the school. cordelia has been blindfolded and is being tied to a gurney.
cordelia: please, what's going on? just take off the blindfold. i promise i won't scream! i promise!
scene direction: daryl lifts the sheet from the headless body they've constructed.
daryl: she's beautiful!
eric: no! it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
scene direction: daryl puts the sheet back down and goes over to cordelia.
cordelia: please? just take off the blindfold! i promise i won't scream! i promise!
daryl: cordelia?
scene direction: he takes off her blindfold. she takes one look at him and screams at the top of her lungs.
eric: you can scream all you want. we're in an abandoned building.
scene direction: cordelia screams for help at an even higher pitch. eric holds up a pan and threatens to hit her with it.
eric: okay, that's enough.
scene direction: cordelia stops her screaming, and eric puts the pan back down.
daryl: you were always good to me. always noticed me. but i ignored you. i'm sorry. i'm glad i have a second chance to tell you that.
cordelia: d-daryl?
daryl: i was thoughtless. i see that now. but i've changed. i've learned to appreciate how much it meant that you wanted to be with me.
eric: we're ready.
cordelia: ready? ready for what?
eric: you're gonna feel a little pinch, maybe some discomfort around the neck area. but don't worry. when you wake up, you'll have the body of a seventeen-year-old. in fact, you'll have the body of several.
scene direction: he lifts the sheet, and cordelia lets out a very intense scream when she sees the body.
scene direction: cut back to the game. buffy walks over to the cooler and finds cordelia's pompoms.
buffy: he was here, chris. where did he take her?
chris: to the rest of the body. to the lab.
buffy: where is that?
chris: i promised him that i...
buffy: look, he'll kill cordelia! you can't just give and take lives like that. it's not your job.
chris: he's in the old science lab. everything's set up there.
buffy: thank you. now find xander and willow and tell them what's going on.
scene direction: she leaves quickly for the lab. chris goes to find the others.
scene change: cut to the lab. eric is pouring gasoline into a sink.
scene direction: cordelia frightened
cordelia: daryl, please. you don't have to do this.
daryl: we have to. so we can be together.
cordelia: we'll be together anyway! i'll be with you, i promise!
daryl: is that right?
cordelia: mm hm!
daryl: you see anything you like?
scene direction: he goes over to the other body and lifts the sheet.
daryl: and when you're finished you won't go out. you won't run away. but we can hide together.
scene direction: cordelia very frightened
cordelia: please! please!
scene direction: eric holds a knife into a flame a moment, and then comes over to her.
eric: sterile enough for government work.
scene direction: he bends over cordelia to begin the procedure.
cordelia: no! no, please!
scene direction: there is a loud pounding on the door. it breaks open and buffy comes in.
scene direction: eric turns around, sees her and throws the knife at her. she catches it in midair.
cordelia: buffy, help me!
scene direction: eric runs away.
buffy: daryl, listen. i know what you're doing, okay? your brother sent me to stop you.
daryl: he wouldn't do that. my brother loves me.
cordelia: buffy, they're crazy!
buffy: it's okay, cordelia. i'm gonna get you outta here.
daryl: no, i'm not done with her yet!
scene direction: he turns to the instrument tray and fumbles around for something. he grabs a cleaver.
daryl: i'm not finished!
scene direction: he takes the cleaver back to cordelia and tries to start hacking at her neck. buffy rushes over, grabs daryl's arm, knocks the cleaver away and punches him in the face. she scrambles around the table to continue the fight, but daryl punches her hard in the face. he grabs her, slams her head into the instrument tray and throws her over cordelia and onto the floor.
daryl: i won't live alone!
scene direction: he pushes cordelia's gurney aside, and it knocks over the can of gasoline. the gas starts pouring out onto the floor.
eric: i'm getting out of here!
scene direction: daryl grabs eric by the shirt
daryl: you have to help me!
eric: let go!
scene direction: daryl throws eric aside and faces buffy again. eric slides into a barrel with his head and gets knocked out. daryl comes at buffy. she kicks him in the knee, making him collapse to the floor. she kicks him again in the gut as he tries to get up. he tries to get up again, and she kicks him in the face. he's not fazed, gets up and tries to swing at her. she ducks it. he tries again, and she ducks again and kicks him in the chest, sending him staggering backward and knocking the bunsen burner to the floor, igniting the gasoline. xander shows up.
xander: buffy!
buffy: get cordelia!
cordelia: xander!
scene direction: xander runs over to cordelia and tries to untie her.
cordelia: get me out of here!
scene direction: daryl grabs hold of buffy and flips her over onto the floor. as she gets up he grabs a canister and throws it at her. she ducks it. the flames around cordelia and xander are starting to get higher. buffy kicks daryl twice in the side.
cordelia: c'mon! c'mon! get it off!
scene direction: daryl grabs buffy again, lifts her and holds on to her while she struggles to free herself. xander is getting nowhere with cordelia's bindings and tries to find a knife.
cordelia: get it off! get me outta here! c'mon!
scene direction: buffy continues to struggle in daryl's grip. giles and willow show up.
scene direction: xander gives up looking and decides to just wheel cordelia out. willow and giles spot eric, pick him up and get him out. xander gives the gurney a good shove, hops on and they roll through the flames while cordelia screams. he hops off, and jenny helps him stop the gurney. they get cordelia loose. buffy hits daryl in the neck, and he lets go of her.
scene direction: she tries to kick him again, but he grabs her leg, lifts her up and throws her to the floor. buffy is stunned and lies there while daryl grabs a desk and raises it over his head.
chris: daryl!
scene direction: daryl looks behind him and sees his brother there.
chris: don't!
scene direction: daryl looks back at buffy and then notices the body surrounded by flames. he tosses the desk aside and rushes over to it.
daryl: she's mine!
chris: daryl!
scene direction: buffy gets up and stops chris from running into the flames after daryl.
chris: daryl!
scene direction: jenny watches, stunned as giles comes back into the room behind her and looks on as well.
daryl: no. we'll be together always. no! mine!
scene direction: the flames engulf daryl and his bride-to-be.
scene direction: cut outside. there are fire engines and police all over. the camera pans down from above over to chris and buffy.
chris: the first time he woke up after... he said i shouldn'ta brought him back. i-i was just... tryin' to look out for him. like... he woulda done for me.
scene direction: angel suddenly shows up
angel: i saw the fire. i figured you'd be here. is everyone okay?
buffy: yeah. we're okay.
scene change: cut to giles walking up to jenny. he hands her a cup of coffee.
giles: sorry about all this.
jenny: it's okay. although a good rule of thumb for a first date is don't do anything so exciting that it'll be hard to top on the second date.
giles: believe it or not, since i've moved here to live on top of the hellmouth, the events of this evening actually qualify as a slow night.
scene direction: giles pauses and considers
giles: did you just say 'second date'?
jenny: you noticed that, huh?
scene direction: jenny smiles
scene change: giles smiles back and takes a sip of his coffee. cut to willow and xander.
xander: well, i guess that makes it official. everybody's paired off. vampires get dates. hell, even the school librarian sees more action than me. you ever think that the world is a giant game of musical chairs, and the music's stopped and we're the only ones who don't have a chair?
willow: all the time.
cordelia: xander? i just wanted to thank you for saving my life. what you did in there was really brave and heroic, and i just wanted to tell you if there was anything that i could ever do to...
xander: do you mind? we're talking here.
scene direction: cordelia is taken aback, rolls her eyes and leaves.
xander: so where were we?
willow: wondering why we never get dates.
xander: yeah, so why do you think that is?
scene change: cut to the cemetery. angel and buffy are strolling through.
buffy: god, the whole thing was so creepy. well, at the same time, i mean... he did do it all for his brother.
angel: sounds like he took it a little over the edge.
buffy: love makes you do the wacky.
angel: what?
buffy: crazy stuff.
angel: oh. crazy, like a two-hundred-and-forty-one-year-old being jealous of a high school junior?
buffy: are you fessing up?
angel: i've thought about it. maybe it bothers me a little.
buffy: i don't love xander.
angel: yeah, but he's in your life. he gets to be there when i can't. take your classes, eat your meals, hear your jokes and complaints. he gets to see you in the sunlight.
buffy: i don't look that good in direct light.
angel: it'll be morning soon.
buffy: i should probably go. i could walk you home.
scene direction: they look at each
