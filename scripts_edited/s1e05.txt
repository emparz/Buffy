scene direction: the cemetery. buffy is fighting a vampire. she kicks him in the face with a high roundhouse kick, forcing him to step backward to keep his balance. the vampire does a jumping half twisting crescent kick, which buffy ducks. he tries two punches, and buffy neatly blocks them. on his third punch she grabs hold of his arm and hits him in the face with a high front snap kick. letting go of the vampire's arm, buffy punches him squarely in the midsection and follows up with a swinging punch to his face, sending him to the ground.
buffy: we haven't been properly introduced.
scene direction: buffy pulls out a stake
buffy: i'm buffy, and you're history!
scene direction: she plunges the stake into him as he gets up. he falls and bursts into ashes.
scene direction: giles pops up from behind a crypt
giles: poor technique.
scene direction: giles comes around to her
giles: prioritizing sub par... execution was adequate, but a bit too bloody for my taste.
buffy: giles, don't mention it. it was my *pleasure* to make the world safe for humanity again.
giles: i'm not saying that your methods are without merit, it's, uh, y- you're spending too much time and energy. it should simply be: plunge, and move on. plunge and... hello.
scene direction: giles bends over to pick up a ring with his pen
scene direction: buffy sees the ring
buffy: oh, that's great! i kill 'em, you fence their stuff.
scene direction: buffy giles gives her a look
buffy: what is it?
giles: i don't know.
buffy: but it bothers you.
giles: yes! well, i... i thought this vampire was just on a random kill, but it may be something else.
buffy: something big?
giles: yes. i'd best consult my books.
scene change: cut to the master's lair. he slams a book down on the podium, opens it and reads.
master: 'and there will be a time of crisis, of worlds hanging in the balance. and in this time shall come the anointed, the master's great warrior. and the slayer will not know him, will not stop him, and he will lead her into hell.' as it is written, so shall it be.
scene direction: master picks up the book and walks
master: 'five will die, and from their ashes the anointed shall rise. the brethren of aurelius shall greet him and usher him to his immortal destiny.'
scene direction: master stops by one of the brethren
master: as it is written, so shall it be. 'and one of the brethren shall go out hunting the night before and get himself killed, because he couldn't wait to finish his job before he ate.' oh, wait.
scene direction: master grabs one of the brethren by the throat
master: that's not written anywhere.
scene direction: master he lifts the vampire from his feet
master: the anointed will be my greatest weapon against the slayer! if you fail to bring him to me, if you allow that girl to stop you...
scene direction: master throws the vampire into a coffin
master: here endeth the lesson.
scene direction: he slams the book shut and walks off.
scene direction: opening credits roll. buffy's theme plays.
scene change: *** part 1 ***
scene direction: the library. buffy is sitting on the table and studying the ring. giles makes his way down to her from the stacks while leafing through a book.
giles: that symbol on the ring... i believe it's the rune for fidelity, but, uh, it doesn't connect with any of the sects that i've studied.
buffy: what about this?
scene direction: buffy shows him the ring
buffy: on the inside. it's a sun and three stars. haven't we seen that somewhere?
giles: let me see.
scene direction: giles takes the ring and looks closely
giles: no, i-i don't think this, um, represents any...
scene direction: buffy looks in a book
buffy: wait, it's right here. sun and three stars. yuch, check these guys out.
scene direction: buffy hands giles the open book
buffy: told you it looked familiar.
giles: oh, the order of aurelius. yes, you're right.
buffy: ooo, two points for the slayer, while the watcher has yet to score!
scene direction: owen comes into the library and approaches them.
buffy: oh!
scene direction: buffy slides off the table
buffy: owen! hi!
scene direction: giles looks up at owen
giles: what do you want?
owen: a book?
giles: oh!
scene direction: buffy to giles
buffy: see, this is a school, and we have students, and they check out books, and then they learn things.
giles: i was beginning to suspect that was a myth.
owen: i lost my emily. dickinson. it's dumb, but i like her around. kind of a security blanket.
buffy: i have something like that. well, it's an actual blanket. uh, and i don't really carry it around anymore... so! emily dickens, huh? she's great!
owen: dickinson.
buffy: she's good also.
scene direction: giles points at the stacks
giles: poetry.
scene direction: owen to buffy
owen: i didn't think i'd find you here.
scene direction: owen goes up the stairs
scene direction: buffy follows owen
buffy: w... why not?
owen: i, i didn't mean... i mean... i think you can read.
buffy: thanks.
owen: but you don't seem bookworm-y.
scene direction: owen finds his book
owen: the type of person to lock themselves in a dark room with a lotta musty old books.
scene direction: owen looks up from the book
owen: oh, and i've offended you.
buffy: no! no, i'm just surprised you gave any thought to what i'm like.
owen: you shouldn't be.
scene direction: owen starts back down
scene direction: buffy follows again
buffy: oh, well, i *love* books. i mean, i really *love* books.
scene direction: owen sees the book they were consulting earlier on the table and heads over there to take a look.
owen: what's this?
scene direction: buffy gets between him and the book
buffy: not this one.
scene direction: giles picks the book up
giles: this one she doesn't love.
scene direction: he walks around buffy, takes owen's book and heads to the checkout station.
giles: oh, emily dickinson.
buffy: we're both fans.
giles: yes, uh, she's quite a good poet, i mean for a...
scene direction: giles takes owen's library card
buffy: a girl?
giles: for an american.
scene direction: giles scans the book and library card
scene direction: owen to buffy
owen: i'll, uh, see you in math... if i open my eyes at some point.
scene direction: owen takes the card and book from giles
buffy: cool...
scene direction: owen leaves. buffy stares after him.
giles: the order of aurelius is a very old and venerated sect. if they're here, it's for a good reason.
buffy: that was owen!
giles: yes, i remember.
buffy: do you have any more copies of emily dickinson? i need one.
scene direction: giles exasperated
giles: buffy, while the mere fact of you wanting to check out a book would be grounds for a national holiday, i think we should focus on the problem at hand.
buffy: right. i'm sorry, you're right. vampires.
scene direction: buffy looks down at her dress
buffy: oh.
scene direction: buffy looks inquisitively at giles
buffy: does this outfit make me look fat?
scene change: cut to the cafeteria. buffy and willow are paying for lunch.
willow: owen thurman was talking to you?
buffy: it's all true.
willow: wow! he hardly talks to anyone. he's solitary, mysterious... he can brood for forty minutes straight, i've clocked him.
buffy: he was so nice, it was eerie.
willow: what did you guys have to talk about?
scene direction: buffy heads for a table
buffy: emily dickinson.
scene direction: willow follows
willow: he reads emily dickinson? he's sensitive, yet manly!
scene direction: willow buffy sets down her tray
willow: well, wait, you've never even read her.
scene direction: buffy pulls out the book and sets it down for willow to see.
willow: you vixen!
scene direction: willow they both sit
scene direction: xander holds up his fork
xander: has anybody given any thought to what this green stuff is?
buffy: hmm, i'm avoiding the subject.
xander: i think it's kale, or possibly string cheese.
scene direction: xander lets the fork drop
xander: so, buffy, how'd the slaying go last night?
scene direction: buffy gives him a stern look
buffy: xander!
xander: i mean, how'd the *laying* go?
scene direction: xander gets another look from buffy
xander: no, i don't mean that either.
buffy: it went fine, thank you. there's some new hoidy-toidy vampire sect in town.
willow: that's bad.
xander: well, hey, they're bringing in the much-needed tourist dollars.
scene direction: xander sees owen
xander: ooo, look at mr. excitement.
buffy: owen! he's all alone! maybe somebody should sit with him.
willow: mm, just to be polite!
scene direction: willow buffy gets up
willow: good luck!
scene direction: xander to willow
xander: okay, what just happened?
scene direction: buffy walks over to owen's table. cordelia is coming over, too, from another direction.
cordelia: look, an empty seat!
scene direction: cordelia bumps buffy
scene direction: buffy spills her tray
buffy: ooo! ew...
owen: let me get that.
scene direction: owen bends down
buffy: thanks!
scene direction: buffy crouches
buffy: boy! cordelia's hips are wider than i thought!
scene direction: cordelia sarcastically
cordelia: eh, heh!
owen: at least you don't have to eat your soylent green.
scene direction: cordelia trying to get attention
cordelia: owen, a bunch of us are loitering at the bronze tonight. you there?
owen: who's all going?
cordelia: well, um, i'm gonna be there.
owen: who else?
cordelia: you mean besides me?
scene direction: owen to buffy
owen: buffy, what about you?
buffy: what?
cordelia: no, no, no! she, uh, she doesn't like fun.
owen: how 'bout we meet there at eight?
buffy: yeah! eight! there!
scene direction: she puts her empty tray on top of cordelia's.
scene change: cut to the halls. buffy and willow come in through the doors.
buffy: it's not that big a deal. it's just a bunch of people getting together.
willow: it's a very big deal!
buffy: it's not!
willow: it is.
scene direction: willow spots giles
willow: tell her!
giles: i'm afraid it's very big.
scene direction: willow smiles at buffy
willow: thank you!
scene direction: willow turns back to giles, confused
scene direction: wait!
scene direction: they follow giles into the library. cut into the library.
willow: what are you talking about?
giles: what are *you* talking about?
buffy and willow: boys!
giles: yes, well, i'm talking about trouble. a violent and disturbing prophecy is about to be fulfilled.
buffy: the order of aurelius.
giles: you were spot on about the connection.
scene direction: giles walks over to the table
scene direction: i've looked at the writings of aurelius himself, and he, he prophesied that the brethren of his order would come to the master and bring him the anointed.
willow: who's that?
giles: well, i-i don't know exactly, a-a-a-a warrior, but, but it says he will rise from the ashes of the five on the evening of the thousandth day after the advent of septus.
buffy: well, we'll be ready whenever it is.
giles: which is tonight.
scene direction: buffy takes in the information
buffy: tonight, okay...
scene direction: buffy realizes the conflict
buffy: not okay! it can't be tonight!
giles: my calculations are precise.
buffy: nuh! they're bad calculations! bad!
willow: buffy has a really important date.
buffy: owen!
giles: alright, i-i'll just jump in my time machine, go back to the twelfth century and ask the vampires to postpone their ancient prophecy for a few days while you take in dinner and a show.
buffy: okay, at this point you're abusing sarcasm.
giles: buffy, this is no ordinary vampire. but we have to stop him before he reaches the master.
buffy: but... cute guy! teenager! post-pubescent fantasies!
giles: those will just have to be put on hold! the dark forces are aligning against us, and we have a chance to beat them back. tonight we go into battle!
scene change: cut to the graveyard. giles and buffy are sitting on a large gravestone.
scene direction: giles sniffs
giles: perhaps i miscalculated.
buffy: i'm thinking yes.
scene direction: buffy sucks her drink dry
giles: well, you know what they say. 90% of the vampire slaying game is, is waiting.
buffy: you couldn't have told me that 90% ago?
giles: well, we, we've certainly waited here long enough.
scene direction: giles gets up
buffy: besides, there aren't any fresh graves. who's gonna rise?
giles: apparently no one tonight.
scene direction: buffy jumps up
buffy: then i can bail? i can go to the bronze and find owen?
giles: oh, very well then. follow your hormones if you want.
scene direction: giles buffy hops down and starts to go
giles: but i assume i don't have to warn you about the hazards of becoming personally involved with someone whose unaware of your unique condition.
buffy: yeah, yeah, i read the back of the box.
giles: if your identity as the slayer is revealed it could put you and all those around you in grave danger.
buffy: well, in that case i won't wear my button that says, 'i'm the slayer, ask me how!'
scene direction: buffy gets a look from giles
buffy: good night.
scene direction: buffy leaves
giles: 'five shall die, and from their ashes the anointed shall rise.' i was sure it was tonight.
scene change: cut to a bus. the passengers ride in silence.
scene direction: collin to andrew
collin: i went on an airplane.
andrew: a pale horse emerged with death as its rider. you will be judged. you will be judged.
scene change: cut to the bronze. buffy goes in and looks around for owen. "rotten apple" by three day wheely is playing on the sound system.
lyrics: ...is real / then you wake up shouting some familiar name / it's not the same.
scene direction: buffy sees owen dancing with cordelia. she looks on, crushed by the sight of them together.
lyrics: you're just a girl / just a girl who knows no shame / whose desperate pace has lost its taste / a never-ending darkness weighs / i can't avoid, i can't complain / i know exactly who's to blame / the girl who shares my...
scene change: cut to the bus. andrew has gotten up and stands in the aisle.
andrew: that day's gonna bring fire. fire comin' down! judgment!
scene direction: andrew to collin and his mom
andrew: don't think you're ready, ready to look upon him. if there's sin in there, there's sin all around. it's a liquid. on that day there won't be anybody tellin' us what to do or why we're doin' it. you can't prepare. on that day...
scene direction: driver to andrew
driver: hey, you gotta sit down. okay?
andrew: are you willing to stand with the righteous?
scene direction: one of the brethren steps in front of the bus. the driver hits the brakes and slams into the vampire. the van begins to swerve, runs through a sign and hits a pole, which brings it to a stop.
scene direction: driver looks back at the passengers
driver: is everyone okay?
scene direction: the passengers look at each other. they all seem shaken but okay. the driver gets out to check the victim.
scene direction: driver to victim
driver: are you all right?
scene direction: driver kneels down beside him
driver: can you move?
scene direction: the vampire grabs him by the throat and begins choking him. another one punches through a window, grabs andrew by the throat, pulls him out and bites him. the vampires all climb into the bus to get the other people.
scene change: *** part 2 ***
scene direction: in the school halls at buffy's locker. she slams it shut and leans on it.
xander: so you just went home?
buffy: what was i supposed to do? say to owen, 'sorry i was late, i was sitting in a cemetery with the librarian waiting for a vampire to rise so i could prevent an evil prophecy from coming to pass?' xander:
scene direction: buffy weighs options with his hands
buffy: or flat tire?
scene direction: buffy starts walking
buffy: i can't take this anymore. i feel like everyone is staring at me, the big, hideous, dateless monster.
scene direction: buffy to a passing student
buffy: what? yeah, that's right, i have no life, c'mon, nothin' to see here, pal, move it along!
scene change: cut to a different part of the hall.
xander: you're acting a little overly, aren't you? i mean, you could have any guy in school.
buffy: he's not any guy. he's more... oweny.
xander: sure, he's got a certain owenosity, but that's not hard to find.
scene direction: xander they reach his locker
xander: i mean, a lotta guys read.
scene direction: xander with a goofy smile
xander: i can read.
scene direction: buffy is leaning on the lockers looking down when she notices owen come up to her.
owen: hey, buffy!
buffy: owen!
xander: oh, look, it's owen.
scene direction: xander gets a look from buffy
xander: buffy and owen. and xander. that'd be me.
owen: w-where were you last night?
buffy: oh. well, um, my watch broke and we don't have any clocks in our house and so i didn't know what time it was or even what day it was...
owen: i thought i was the only one that happened to. how 'bout we try it again for tonight? i'll even lend you my watch.
scene direction: he hands her his gold pocket watch and chain. xander looks at the watch in wide-eyed amazement. buffy accepts it.
buffy: tonight? y-you and me?
scene direction: xander looks at his tweety wristwatch.
owen: well, we could invite the chess club, but they drink and they start fights...
buffy: oh, no, it's just... well, i... sort of heard that... you and cordelia were... somewhat... all over each other. a little...
owen: i danced with her a couple of times.
scene direction: owen with a look of distaste
scene direction: she's kinda grabby.
buffy: oh, well, let's see, if i rearrange that, and i push that to n... sure! tonight'll work!
owen: great! i'll pick you up at seven?
buffy: um, seven!
owen: that's when the little hand's
scene direction: owen points on the pocket watch
owen: there.
buffy: oh! between the six and the eight.
owen: um, i'll see you then!
scene direction: owen leaves
scene direction: buffy watches him go
buffy: tonight! isn't that so?
xander: what?
buffy: me and owen!
scene direction: buffy walks off
scene direction: xander feeling down
xander: yeah, so it is.
scene direction: xander closes his locker
xander: it sure is so.
scene change: cut to giles' office. he has a headache from researching and is just sitting down to have some tea. buffy barges in.
buffy: hey, how's it going?
giles: uh, alright.
buffy: that's great! i see we're still working on that anointed one problem, that'll probably take you a few days, right? i mean, that's one obscure prophecy...
giles: well, yes, there are a few interpretations...
buffy: so tonight's looking slow, right? probably best to relax and regroup, no big disasters coming, that is *so* good, i will see you tomorrow then! bye!
scene direction: buffy leaves quickly
giles: she is the strangest girl.
scene change: cut to the master's lair.
master: you have done well. everything is in place. when this night's work is done, i will have a mighty ally. i'll be one step closer to freeing myself from this... mystical prison.
scene direction: master feels his confines
master: i've been trapped down here so long i've nearly forgotten what it's like on the surface. well, there'll be time enough to remember... when i rule it! if she tries to stop you, kill her. give your own lives, but do not fail to bring the anointed. i know you won't disappoint me.
scene direction: master quickly grabs a bug from the air
master: bug!
scene change: cut to buffy's room. she's wearing her bathrobe, and willow is helping her decide on an outfit.
willow: pick!
scene direction: buffy to xander
buffy: okay,
scene direction: buffy willow holds up one mini-dress
buffy: do i wanna appear shy, coy and naive or
scene direction: buffy willow holds up the other
buffy: unrestrained, insatiable and aggressive?
scene direction: xander watching from the bed
xander: uh, y'know, owen is a little home spun, he probably doesn't like that overly assertive look.
scene direction: xander goes to her closet
xander: oh, hey, here's something. a nice comfy overcoat and a ski cap!
scene direction: xander holds them up to her
xander: the ear flaps will bring out your eyes!
scene direction: buffy and willow exchange a look.
buffy: maybe i should mix and match.
scene direction: buffy willow nods
buffy: okay, guy's opinion.
scene direction: buffy grabs two lipsticks from her desk
buffy: which one do you think owen will like better?
scene direction: buffy holds them up
buffy: the red or the peach?
xander: oh, you mean for kissing you and then telling all his friends how easy you are so the whole school loses respect for you and then talks behind your back? the red's fine.
buffy: thanks. i'll go with the peach.
scene direction: buffy puts on the lipstick
scene direction: willow hands buffy a third mini-dress
willow: here, put this on.
scene direction: buffy and willow look at xander.
xander: you're not bothering me!
scene direction: willow sighs and pushes him away.
scene direction: willow to buffy
willow: so, where's he taking you?
buffy: oh, i don't know. where do you suppose young kids go on dates these days?
scene direction: buffy unties her bathrobe
scene direction: xander goes over to her drawer chest and tries to angle the mirror inside a box so he can see.
willow: well, i read somewhere once that sometimes they go to movies.
scene direction: buffy finishes pulling on the mini-dress
buffy: movies! interesting!
willow: and i saw on tv once, a bunch of people our age went to a party.
scene direction: buffy pulls on a boot
buffy: wow! i never knew being a teenager was so full of possibilities!
scene direction: buffy pulls on the other boot
scene direction: xander fumbles with the box. buffy and willow look over at him. the door bell rings.
buffy: that's owen!
scene change: cut to buffy opening the door.
buffy: that's giles.
giles: we need to talk.
buffy: buffy's not home.
scene direction: buffy tries to close the door
scene direction: giles pushes the door open and comes in
giles: my calculations may not have been as far off as i thought.
scene direction: giles holds up a newspaper
scene direction: buffy reads
buffy: 'five die in van accident'?
giles: out of the ashes of five shall rise the one. that's the prophecy. five people have died!
buffy: in a car crash.
giles: i know it doesn't quite follow, but, but it's worth investigating. look! among the dead was andrew borba, whom the police sought for questioning in a double murder. now, he may be the anointed one. the, the bodies have been taken to, to sunnydale funeral home, w-we can...
scene direction: buffy interrupts
buffy: giles, why do you wanna hurt me?
giles: i beg your pardon?
scene direction: owen shows up at the open door
owen: hey!
scene direction: owen comes in
owen: uh, hi!
giles: you have a date.
buffy: yes, but i will return those overdue books by tomorrow.
giles: wait, you're not getting off that easily.
owen: man, you really care about your work!
scene direction: willow thinking quickly
willow: uh, owen?
xander: yeah, a couple of things about tonight.
scene direction: willow and xander lead owen into the living room.
giles: another date? don't you ever do anything else?
buffy: this is the first date! there's never been a date, okay? this is my maiden voyage!
scene change: cut to the next room.
owen: what, she doesn't like to dance?
xander: well, it's a little too late to do anything about that. uh, you should probably know that buffy doesn't like to be kissed. actually she doesn't like to be touched.
willow: xander...
xander: as a matter of fact, don't even look at her.
scene direction: cut back to the foyer.
buffy: we don't even know if this is anything.
giles: no, we don't.
buffy: and i haven't had a day off in a while.
giles: true...
buffy: and a cranky slayer is a careless slayer!
giles: buffy, maintaining a normal social life as a slayer... i-i-is problematic at best.
buffy: this is the 90's. the 1990's, in point of fact, and i can do both. clark kent has a job. i just wanna go on a date.
giles: well, i, i suppose it was a fairly slim lead...
scene direction: buffy pleased
buffy: thank you, thank you, thank you! and look, i won't go far, okay? if the apocalypse comes, beep me.
scene direction: owen comes back
owen: is everything cool?
buffy: all set.
giles: yes, and, uh, you'll face a pretty hefty fine in the morning.
buffy: well, bye. don't wait up.
scene direction: buffy leaves quickly with owen
willow: is something going on?
giles: oh, uh, probably not, no. i, uh, i suppose i'll just, uh, go to the funeral home in case, just see if anything comes up.
scene direction: giles leaves
scene direction: willow to xander, concerned
willow: this is bad.
xander: i wish it was just bad.
willow: we should... go along.
xander: yeah, you're right. i don't trust that owen guy. it's the eyes. crazy!
willow: xander, we should go with giles! he could get in trouble!
xander: oh, he's gone, uh, it's, he's gonna be alright. he's like super librarian, y'know? everyone forgets, willow, that knowledge is the ultimate weapon.
scene change: cut to the bronze. velvet chain is playing tonight. they begin with "strong". owen and buffy are sitting at a table talking.
lyrics: i'll be right along / 'cause, baby, you're so strong.
owen: the thing about emily dickinson i love is, is she's just so incredibly morbid. a lot of loss, a lot of death... it gets me. with a lot about bees, for some reason.
buffy: did she have a tragic and romantic life? with a lotta bees?
owen: quiet. kind of sequestered and uneventful. which i can really relate to. i... don't get out much.
buffy: i don't get that.
owen: it's my fault. i just find most girls pretty frivolous. i mean, there's a lot more important things in life than dating, y'know?
scene direction: owen buffy looks down at her beeper
owen: oh. did i say something wrong?
buffy: uh, no! come on.
scene direction: she leads owen to the dance floor.
lyrics: baby, baby, i know it's always been so / physical love is, oh, so meaningful for you.
scene direction: buffy and owen dance close.
owen: it's weird.
buffy: what is?
owen: you! one minute you're right there. i've got you figured. the next, it's like you're two people.
buffy: really? which one do you like better?
owen: i'll let you know.
lyrics: so strong / baby, i'm yours / you know / because you're so / so strong.
scene change: cut to cordelia entering the bronze with some of her friends. she sees buffy with owen.
cordelia: aren't there laws against this sort of thing?
scene direction: cordelia walks over to buffy and owen
cordelia: owen! look at you, here all alone...
lyrics: you're so, so strong.
owen: cordelia, i'm here with buffy.
cordelia: oh! okay. do you wanna dance?
owen: no, i'm still here with buffy.
cordelia: you are so good to help the needy.
buffy: cordelia, owen and i would like to be alone right now, and for that to happen, you would have to go somewhere that's away.
scene direction: cordelia gives buffy a look
scene direction: cordelia to owen
cordelia: well, when you're ready for the big leagues, let me know.
scene direction: cordelia leaves
lyrics: you would suffer, suffer for me.
scene change: cut to the sunnydale funeral home. giles drives up in his ancient car.
scene direction: it's quiet. he gets out, slings his bag over his shoulder and starts around his car to the building. the night is creepy, and he has a look around. he continues toward the building, but stops short when he senses something. he looks around again to his right. nothing. as he turn back he sees one of the brethren in front of him. he starts to back away, but another one is behind him.

buffy: damn it!
scene direction: owen appears behind them
owen: this is so cool!
buffy: uh, owen! you can't be here!

buffy: possibly several.
scene direction: buffy to xander and willow
buffy: guys, watch him.
scene direction: buffy runs back the way they came

buffy: giles!
giles: it is you. oh, good.
buffy: what happened?
giles: uh, two more of the brethren came in here. they came after me. but i was more than a match for them.
buffy: meaning...?
giles: i hid. uh, this, uh, chap was good enough to bunk with me till they went away.
scene direction: giles he jumps down off of the cadaver
buffy: well, w-were they here after you, or w-was it that prophecy thing?
giles: ah, well, that's what we have to find out. i don't know what these brethren mean to do exactly. find the anointed, or, or, or, or give him something perhaps, uh, it's all, all very vague! and the anointed may be long gone!
buffy: but he may not be.
giles: we must find out.
buffy: okay, i just need to get owen and the others out of harm's way first.
giles: owen? you brought a date?
scene direction: buffy exhales
buffy: i didn't bring him, he came.
giles: buffy, when i said you could slay vampires and have a social life, i didn't mean at the same time.
buffy: i know. i'll get rid of him.
scene direction: buffy starts to leave
giles: y-you can't make him go out there alone, we don't know where the brethren are. i-i'll just...
buffy: no! no, giles, he sees you, he's gonna have more questions than he already does right now. i'll take care of it.
scene direction: she runs out into the hall and looks around for the others. they come around a corner and see her.
willow: is everything okay?
buffy: it is.
xander: and we'll be leaving?
owen: we're not done lookin' around yet!
buffy: no, he's right. so let's find a nice, safe, fun room to look around in.
scene direction: she takes owen's hand and leads the group down the hall. they reach the office door.

scene direction: buffy breaks the lock
buffy: no it's not!

owen: okay.
scene direction: owen confused
owen: what?
scene direction: buffy finished looking
buffy: i have to go now.
scene direction: buffy laughs nervously
buffy: um, to the bathroom, i have to go to the bathroom. if you hear anything, like a security guard or something, just be really quiet.

willow: uh, just in case!
scene direction: owen sees a curtain and draws it open. behind the window he sees a body covered with a sheet.
owen: oh, my!
scene direction: willow and xander turn around to look.
scene change: cut to the morgue. buffy and giles are still looking. there's only one storage cell left. giles opens it quickly and buffy pulls out the drawer. it's empty.
buffy: nothing.
giles: the anointed must be gone.
buffy: i guess. i mean, this is where they keep all the dead bodies, right?
giles: mm-hm.
scene change: cut to the office. owen is looking at the body with fascination. willow and xander look worried.
owen: i read a lot about death, but... but i've... never really seen a dead body before.
scene direction: the body's hand moves.
owen: do they... usually move?
scene direction: the hand moves again. willow and xander approach to have a closer look.
scene direction: the hand reaches up and pulls the sheet off. andrew sits up and faces them. he is a vampire now. he stands up, looks down at himself and flexes his hands. he looks back up at them.

xander: she'll be okay. c'mon!
scene direction: they continue running. buffy tries to find andrew. she can hear him singing as he comes down the hall toward her.
andrew: shall we gather at the river? / the beautiful, the beautiful river?
scene direction: she decides to try to head him off another way. xander, willow and owen find the exit, but are blocked by the brethren. willow screams. xander pulls her around and behind himself. instead of attacking, the brethren close the gates. the hall is empty, but they can hear andrew singing.
willow: i think he's coming this way!
scene direction: they run and find themselves at the same dead end as when they first got there.
owen: oh, god, this is too much!
scene change: cut to the morgue. giles is still there. buffy rushes in.
buffy: what've you got?

owen: buffy!
scene direction: andrew raises her above his head.
owen: no!
scene direction: he grabs a tray and swings it into andrew's back, stunning him. his knees buckle and he lets go of buffy. she staggers into an open body drawer door and falls down unconscious. andrew turns, grabs owen by the neck and growls as he moves in to bite. owen grabs an urn from a shelf and smashes it over andrew's head. he falls. owen goes over to help buffy. she wakes up again and tries to get up.

scene direction: buffy gets him solidly in the gut with a front snap kick. he rolls over the autopsy gurney and onto the floor. she runs around to the far end of the gurney. andrew quickly gets up. she pushes the gurney into his gut, and then pushes down on her end so it pivots up to hit him in the chin.
scene direction: he staggers back and falls. she jumps up onto the gurney and does a roundoff onto the floor as he gets up. he swings widely at buffy's face, but she blocks it. he tries again with his other arm, hitting buffy solidly in the face and knocking her to the ground. he taunts her as she quickly gets up.

xander: j-just give her a sec!
scene direction: buffy blocks another punch, and then hits andrew in the face with an open-hand punch. blocking a second punch from him, she hits him in the gut with another open-hand punch. as he leans forward from the pain, she knees him in the gut, and then shoves him backward into a counter.
buffy: you killed my date!
scene direction: giles regains consciousness. andrew turns back to buffy.
andrew: your turn!
scene direction: he lunges at buffy, but she sidesteps him and uses his forward momentum to launch him into the air. he lands on the gurney, and it rolls over to the crematory. the gurney stops when it hits, but andrew continues to slide through the open door. giles kicks the gurney away and slams the crematory door shut. andrew screams. buffy watches him burn through the small window. then she notices owen trying to sit up.

buffy: owen!
scene direction: buffy crouches beside him

buffy: oh... we scared him away.
owen: oh, good. 'cause, y'know, i would've...
buffy: i know. here...
scene direction: buffy helps him up
buffy: i'm sure this isn't exactly what you had in mind for our first date.
scene direction: owen rubs his head
owen: yeah! i was hoping maybe we'd finish at ben & jerry's.
buffy: we still could...
owen: no, i, i, i think i'll just walk home.
scene direction: owen starts to go, but stops
scene direction: uh, which way's home?
buffy: i'll get you there.
owen: no, i'll, i'll go it alone.
scene direction: willow and xander come over.

scene direction: they lead owen away. buffy watches them go. giles comes over behind her.
giles: buffy, if i might, uh...
scene direction: buffy cuts him off
buffy: don't!
scene direction: buffy slowly walks out
scene change: cut to the school. buffy, xander and willow are walking along the balcony.
buffy: well, did owen say anything about me on the way home?
willow: oh, you mean specifically about you?
buffy: or generally... i-in the area, in the ballpark, any sort of indication?
scene direction: they round the corner and start down the stairs.
xander: well, in that case, no.
willow: but he was pretty incoherent, so we might've missed it.
buffy: you think?
xander: no.
buffy: i knew it. i totally blew it last night!
xander: no, see, what you need is a guy who already knows your deepest, darkest secrets and still says, 'hey! i like that girl!' someone like...
scene direction: buffy sees owen
buffy: owen!
willow: well, heh... this is our stop.
scene direction: she walks around buffy and drags xander away with her.
owen: hi.
buffy: hi.
scene direction: buffy long awkward pause
buffy: this is going well.
owen: i don't really know how to say this, but... about last night...
buffy: you don't even have to. i'm sure you were pretty freaked out.
owen: totally.
scene direction: owen buffy looks down
owen: and... i was wondering when i could see you again.
scene direction: buffy looks back up
buffy: um, that was my hopeful ear. could you repeat that?
owen: i think you're the coolest!
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: really?
owen: i mean, last night was incredible! i never thought nearly getting killed would make me feel so... alive!
scene direction: buffy looks down and starts to walk
buffy: so that's why you wanna be with me.
scene direction: owen follows her
owen: oh, absolutely! when can we do something like that again?
buffy: something like...
owen: like, walk downtown at three in the morning, a-and pick a fight in a bar. how about tonight?
buffy: tonight would...
scene direction: buffy they stop walking
buffy: be... not a workable thing. did i just say that?
owen: tomorrow, then. i-i'm free any night this week.
buffy: i'm not. please don't take this personally. it's not you, it's me.
scene direction: owen beginning to get it
owen: right. it's you.
buffy: and i was kinda hoping that... maybe you and i could still be...
scene direction: owen very disappointed
owen: i, i get it. you just wanna be friends.
buffy: that'd be nice.
owen: friends. yeah. great.
scene direction: owen leaves
lyrics: the world will keep on turning / it'll all be there come morning / so tonight...
buffy: yeah. great.
lyrics: let the sun fall down all around you.
scene direction: giles comes up behind her. they watch owen leave. buffy notices giles and looks at him. he's at a loss. she goes over to sit on a bench. giles follows her.
giles: i was ten years old when my father told me i was destined to be a watcher.
scene direction: giles sits next to her
giles: he was one, and his, uh, mother before him, and i was to be next.
buffy: were you thrilled beyond all measure?
giles: no, i had very definite plans about my future. i was going to be a fighter pilot. or possibly a grocer, well, uh... my father gave me a very tiresome speech about, uh, responsibility and sacrifice.
buffy: sacrifice, huh?
scene direction: giles looks toward owen
giles: seems like a nice lad.
buffy: yeah. but he wants to be danger man. you, xander, willow, you guys... you guys know the score, you're careful. two days in my world and owen really would get himself killed. or i'd get him killed.
scene direction: buffy faces giles
buffy: or someone else.
giles: i, i went to the funeral home of my own free will.
buffy: and i should've been there.
giles: buffy...
buffy: i blew it!
giles: i have volumes of lore, of prophecies, of predictions. but i don't have an instruction manual. we feel our way as we go along. and, i must say, as a slayer, you're, you're doing... pretty well.
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: well. at least i did stop that prophecy thing from coming true.
giles: you did! handily. no more anointed one. and i would imagine the master, wherever he is, is having a fairly bad day himself.
scene direction: he smiles. buffy laughs back.
scene change: cut to the master in his lair.
scene direction: master quotes scripture
master: 'and in this time will come the anointed. and the slayer will not know him. she will not stop him, and he will lead her into hell.'
scene direction: master kneels down next to collin
master: welcome, my friend.
scene direction: the end
