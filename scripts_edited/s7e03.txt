dawn: oh, tell us again what you said.
xander: well, i was talking from my heart and i knew evil willow wasn't really ready to— you were kidding.

xander: so, she got off in chicago when they stopped?
dawn: she could've caught a flight anywhere from there.
scene direction: buffy crosses arms
buffy: maybe she doubled back. got off the plane in london after giles left.
dawn: well, if she's doing that—ducking giles—then, she's evil, right?
xander: well, i've avoided giles tons of times. just meant i was lazy, not evil.
buffy: i hope you're right, because defeating lazy willow—probably less hard.
dawn: we should check the messages... see if she tried to reach us here.

xander: is he throwing a tasteful british wiggins?
buffy: oh, with extra wig. he's blaming himself pretty hard, like he should've known she wasn't ready to come back. i-i kept telling him, you know, it wasn't his fault. maybe something about us she couldn't face.
xander: like she didn't think we were ready to forgive her? i get that.
dawn: so giles is blaming giles, and we're blaming us. is anyone gonna blame willow? oh, don't give me shock face. i mean, will anyone around here ever start asking for help when they need it?
buffy: look, if willow flipped out, it's her bad. we can only be here for her so much if she won't be, you know, here.

willow: anya!
scene direction: anya sees willow and steps back defensively.
willow: anya, don't! don't run away.
anya: what are you doing here? i thought you were with giles studying how to not kill people.
willow: i just got back.
anya: just got back, as in you're all better, or just got back to bring about a fiery apocalypse of death.
willow: neither, but i-i have been studying, working real hard, and i-i'm gonna be fine.
anya: oh. good. 'cause i remember the last time you said that. i've spent a lot of time since them cleaning the debris out of my ex-livelihood. stuff like that.
willow: well, yeah, i wanna help any way i can with that. i-i feel really responsible.
scene direction: anya walks towards her
anya: you feel really responsible? you are really responsible!
willow: i-i know i hurt you and—and everyone. i'm sorry.
anya: here's something you should know about vengeance demons: we don't group with the "sorry." we prefer "oh, god, please stop hitting me with my own rib bones."
willow: go on. say whatever you want. rib bones and so forth. i-i deserve it.
anya: then you won't mind?
scene direction: anya willow shakes her head no
anya: well, then, that's no fun.
willow: sorry.
scene direction: willow sits down on the curb side in front of the store. anya sighs, puts the box she's holding down beside willow and sits down next to it. willow picks up a large, three-horned animal skull from the box to play with while she talks.
willow: so, um, where is everyone these days?
anya: well, i'm back in my own apartment. and, of course, vengeance takes me all over the world. i was in brazil yesterday. they love their soccer.
willow: and the others? dawn, and, uh, xander, buffy?
scene direction: willow accidentally breaks off one of the prongs on the skill, and quickly puts it back in the box.
anya: you haven't seen them?
willow: not so much.
anya: huh. i guess they're still mad at you. they've been a little temperamental lately, just between you and me. we had this little mix-up a few days ago, and —
willow: that sounds great. so, um, where do you think they'd be?
anya: oh, at the new high school, probably. everyone's all about the high school. buffy's got some kind of job there helping junior deviants, spike's insane in the basement, xander's there doing construction on the new gym—
willow: wait, spike's what in the whatment?
anya: insane. base. xander does construction. he likes to start early, so he's probably there by now.
scene direction: cut to 21 ext. construction site at sunnydale high school - day
scene direction: willow walks up to the edge of the pit where they're doing construction. willow calls out over the site, looking around for xander.
willow: xander? xander, you down there?
scene direction: no answer, so she climbs down the retaining wall on a ladder. this is the retaining wall that the teen boy was painting last night. willow walks around and stops suddenly when she looks down. zoom to a dead person lying on the ground with no skin.
scene direction: cut to 22 ext. construction site at sunnydale high school - day
scene direction: zoom back up to where willow was standing, but now there's buffy and xander instead.
buffy: no skin.
xander: tough to look at.
buffy: and yet my eyes refuse to look away. stupid eyes.
xander: i found it first thing this morning. i gave my crew the day off, and i called you right away.
buffy: i got to get a job where i don't get called right away for this stuff.
scene direction: xander wipes his mouth. there's a clanking noise coming from behind him. on camera, a panicked willow climbs the ladder to leave the site, but when xander turns to look at the noise behind him, he sees only an empty ladder. he turns back to look at the dead person, and continues talking to buffy.
xander: yeah, i know exactly what you're thinking. maybe willow is back.
scene change: fade to black.

scene direction: cut to 24 int. basement sunnydale high - day
scene direction: willow walks around the basement looking around. there are spare bookshelves and other classroom equipment stored there. then spike jumps out from out of nowhere and yells at her.
spike: out! this is my place. you need permission to be here. you need a special slip with a stamp.
willow: spike. my god... i—
scene direction: spike ranting, pacing
spike: you go off and try to wall up the bad parts and put your heart back in where it fell out. you call yourself finished, but you're not. worse than ever, you are...
scene direction: spike stops pacing and stands still with his head tilted down a little. he's silent and pensive. then he walks forward with a confused expression on his face. in an entirely different demeanor, more restrained and calm, he starts talking again, but not facing willow.
spike: you went away. you've been gone since...
willow: i needed to go, but i'm back now. and i found... there's a body.
spike: tragedy.
scene direction: spike faces willow
spike: is there blood?
willow: uh, i, yeah, and i can't find buffy or xander or dawn. and there's this thing killing people. and the victim was... skinned. what could do that?
spike: you did it once. i heard about it.
willow: anything other—other than me?
scene direction: spike is not facing willow, but instead, he's facing ninety degrees away from her. smiling sweetly all of a sudden, he's no longer talking to her. he walks forward several steps and starts talking again.
spike: look at you... glowing. what's a word means "glowing"? gotta rhyme.
willow: spike?
spike: oh, ah, no. i-i-i should hide. hide from you. hide my face. you know what i did.
willow: what you did? you didn't do anything... did you?
spike: everyone's talking to me. no one's talking to each other.
scene direction: spike turns to face willow suspiciously.
willow: spike, please try to listen to me.
scene direction: now, more confident, spike starts pacing slowly. he steps behind one of the bookcases, talking to himself. willow's confused.
spike: someone isn't here. button, button... who's got the button? my money's on
scene direction: spike stops and faces willow
spike: the witch.
scene direction: cut to 25 int. basement sunnydale high - day
scene direction: xander and buffy are walking together in the basement, talking.
xander: we can't use the blueprints to find our way around down here. it's like the walls move or something.
scene direction: off screen, spike can be heard yelling.
spike o.s.: out! this is my place.
scene direction: buffy to xander
buffy: i think i hear him.
spike o.s.: you need permission to be here. you need a special slip with a stamp.
scene direction: buffy and xander follow his voice and open a door to the area where spike is pacing back and forth, apparently talking to himself.
scene direction: spike ranting, pacing
spike: ... and put your heart back in where it fell out. you call yourself finished, but you're not. worse than ever, you are...
scene direction: spike stops pacing and stands still with his head tilted down a little. he's silent and pensive.
buffy: spike. spike.
scene direction: then he walks forward with a confused expression on his face. in an entirely different demeanor, more restrained and calm, he starts talking again to buffy.
spike: you went away. you've been gone since...
buffy: the church. you scared me a little. i didn't—i didn't know what to think.
xander: we're here for a reason, spike.
spike: tragedy.
scene direction: spike faces right, away from xander and buffy
spike: is there blood?
xander: he knows. he must have seen the body.
spike: you did it once. i heard about it.
buffy: spike, we need to know who did this.
scene direction: spike is smiling sweetly all of a sudden. he walks forward several steps and starts talking again.
spike: look at you... glowing. what's a word means "glowing"? gotta rhyme.
buffy: spike, please...
spike: i-i-i should hide. hide from you. hide my face. you know what i did.
xander: boy, he's extra-useful today.
scene direction: buffy whispering to xander
buffy: this isn't the time.
spike: everyone's talking to me. no one's talking to each other.
scene direction: spike turns to face over his right shoulder suspiciously.
scene direction: buffy to xander
buffy: might as well go.
scene direction: now, more confident, spike starts pacing slowly. he steps behind one of the bookcases, talking to himself. buffy and xander start walking away.
spike: someone isn't here. button, button... who's got the button? my money's on
scene direction: spike stops and faces his right
spike: the witch.
scene direction: buffy and xander stop in their tracks and turn around to face spike again.
spike: red's a bad girl.
buffy: he's talking about willow.
xander: and that means something because he's chock-full-o-sanity.
buffy: maybe he saw her.
spike: they think you did it. the slayer and her boy. they think you took the skin.
buffy: is there something here? something that killed?
scene direction: xander offended
xander: her boy? i'm her boy?
scene direction: spike walks up to xander and buffy.
spike: i have to go. there are things here without permission. i have to check their slips. make sure they have authorization.
scene direction: spike walks away, deeper into the basement.
scene direction: cut to 26 int. anya's apartment - day
scene direction: willow knocks on anya's door. anya opens it.
willow: i need help.
anya: i don't have any money.
willow: i don't want money.
scene direction: willow walks into the apartment without waiting for an invitation. anya looks peeved.
anya: come in. enjoy my personal space.
scene direction: anya shuts door
willow: i found a dead body near the high school.
anya: yes, that can happen.
willow: something horrible killed a boy. took his skin right off.
scene direction: anya and willow have the same reaction at the same moment, and speak simultaneously.
anya & willow: was it you?
scene direction: anya & willow shocked
anya & willow: no.
anya: well with the skin thing, they're definitely going to think it was you. buffy is, anyway.
willow: yeah. i mean maybe she already does. i don't know. i just—i-i have to find whatever did this. i just—i need to do something right.
anya: oh, and so they'll think it wasn't you, right? i mean, that has to be part of it. maybe you're even thinking you kill this thing, they don't even have to know about it. won't suspect you, even for a minute.
willow: no, i-i don't— when did you get all insightful?
anya: i'm surprisingly sensitive.
willow: so, will you help me?
scene direction: anya sighs
anya: is it difficult or time-consuming?
scene direction: cut to 27 int. anya's apartment - day
scene direction: now the curtains in anya's apartment are closed, blocking the sunlight. candles are lit and she and willow are sitting on the floor, indian-style, facing each other, with a map of sunnydale between them.
anya: this isn't going to get all sexy, is it?
willow: i'd be shocked. ok, do you have your powder?
anya: oh, i ate that. i have it.
willow: ok, we scatter it over the map, and everywhere there's a demon, a little light appears.
anya: oh, pretty! will it hurt the carpet?
willow: no.
scene direction: willow pauses to clear her thoughts
willow: ok, scatter.
scene direction: willow and anya dust the map with the powder from their individual jars. several individual dots glow in various places on the map, but there is a heavy concentration of glowing dots in the center of the map.
anya & willow: oh!
anya: hey look—that's me! hello. what's that huge clump?
willow: it's the high school. it's all hellmouthy is underneath.
anya: things have been stirring there lately. is it getting brighter?
willow: smoke!
scene direction: the clump of lights at the high school gets brighter and brighter until it catches the map on fire. willow and anya stand up immediately, and willow stamps out the fire with her foot. anya is upset and bends down to investigate the damage.
anya: ah! ok. remember our talk about the carpet?
scene direction: willow holds up the map to inspect the marks left behind on it by the glowing lights.
willow: thi-this could be it. it's strong, it's near the body, and it's all by itself, hiding in the woods or-or maybe cave. there are a couple of good caves around there.
anya: i don't know. sounds pretty thin to me.
scene direction: anya starts cleaning up the mark on the rug.
willow: well, that's why you teleport over there real quick like a bunn—real quick and, uh, see if i'm right.
anya: no. sorry. you damaged my carpet.
willow: anya, you're a vengeance demon. just teleport!
anya: well, as it turns out, teleporting isn't a right, it's a privilege. i withdrew a vengeance spell last week, and this is my punishment. i can only teleport for official business. i have to file a flight plan and everything.
willow: oh. i'm sorry. that must be hard.
anya: yeah, it bites a pretty big one. and the vengeance itself, i-it's not as fulfilling as i remember.
willow: really? 'cause i got the impression that you enjoyed—you know, inflicting.
anya: well, causing pain sounds really cool, i know, but turns out it's really upsetting. didn't use to be, but now it is.
scene direction: anya walks around, still fussing over the carpet stain.
willow: is it like you're scared of losing that feeling again. and that having it be ok to hurt people. and then you're not in charge of the power anymore because it's in charge of you?
anya: wow, that was really over-dramatically stated, but, yeah, that's it.
willow: i get it. believe me.
scene direction: anya sincerely
anya: i'm sorry, willow. i wish it were better for you.
willow: you too.
anya: it did get a little sexy, didn't it?
scene direction: willow nods, then catches herself, walks away quickly
willow: i have to find this monster.
scene direction: anya holding candles now
anya: willow... um, isn't there another spell? i mean, you're trying to find buffy and xander. couldn't we use a spell to do that?
willow: i did. i-i tried, and something went kaflooey, and it didn't work.
anya: what did it say?
willow: it said they don't exist.
scene direction: willow walks out of the apartment and closes the door behind her. anya blows out the candles.
scene direction: cut to 28 int. dining room at buffy's house - day
scene direction: dawn, buffy, and xander are sitting around the dining room table doing research. buffy has several books open in front of her, while dawn is surfing the internet on her laptop. xander has a book in his lap.
dawn: ok, so i looked up demons that skin their victims and demons that flay their victims 'cause, you know, same thing. there's a ton of prospects. anything else gone? uh, eyeballs, toenails or viscera? that's guts.
buffy: she knows about viscera. makes you proud.
xander: just skin.
dawn: ok, i'll work on that.
scene direction: buffy sighs, stands up, and walks to a corner of the room. xander follows.
xander: what's up?
buffy: i need to do something. i just—i have this feeling in my gut—
xander: in your viscera!
buffy: —that we know exactly who did this. and all of this work that we're doing is just a way for us to convince ourselves that willow's ok.
dawn: oh, guys!
scene direction: dawn gesturing them to come over to her
dawn: i got a good one. a demon called "gnarl." he's a parasite with these nasty long fingernails. he secretes something through them and uses that to paralyze his victims. he then cuts strips of their skin while they're still alive. it takes hours.
xander: we didn't find any strips of skin. which, by the way,
scene direction: xander shudders
xander: gghhhh!
dawn: you wouldn't. he eats them. that's why he's a parasite. it's like his natural food.
buffy: dawn, you're new at this, and i get why you're proud, but i'm not exactly sure why this demon is any more likely than any of the others.
dawn: you never said pool of blood.
buffy: there was no pool, just splatters.
scene direction: dawn smiling
dawn: then this is your guy. he laps up the blood. you could say it's like his natural beverage.
scene direction: xander points at dawn
xander: you're terrifying.
dawn: now if we just knew how to find this thing.
xander: well, we could ask some questions over at willy's place.
buffy: or, we could be smart. sorry, xander.
xander: what?
buffy: w-whoever did this had to get blood on them, which means they left a trail.
dawn: right, minute traces of blood.
buffy: and we have a way to track it.
dawn: we have a— oh, i get it.
xander: what? how? what's going on?
scene direction: cut to 29 ext. woods near sunnydale - night
scene direction: spike's walking around, mumbling to himself.
spike: william's a good boy. carries her water, carries her sin. supposed to get easier, isn't it. supposed to help to help, but it doesn't. still so heavy.
scene direction: xander, buffy, and dawn are following spike.
xander: should've put a leash on him.
buffy: yes, let's tie ourselves to the crazy vampire.
xander: you really think it's gonna work?
buffy: it's pretty easy. spike follows the exciting smell of blood, and we follow the fairly ripe smell of spike.
dawn: it's smellementary. also, i'm sure there's tons of stuff like this. you know, procedures we can use that don't involve magic spells. just good solid detective work. and we can develop a database of tooth impressions and demon skin samples and i could wear high heels more often.
buffy: wow, that was so close to being empowered.
dawn: everybody loves a slender ankle.
scene direction: spike has stopped walking. he's standing still staring through the bushes at a rock cliff. the group catches up to him.
spike: that's it. end of the line. everyone off.
scene direction: spike turns to xander
spike: keep your ticket, you'll need that.
buffy: that's a rock cliff.
xander: well, give him a break, buffy. maybe it's a vicious skin-eating rock cliff.
spike: there's a cave in it. look.
scene direction: spike pushes the bush aside
spike: i'm insane. what's his excuse?

scene direction: cut to 34 int. cave near sunnydale - night
scene direction: willow is standing still, looking around to see what's there, who's talking to her.
gnarl o.s.: look at the shorn lamb. see how he trembles. is it the cold wind? or is it that the flock is nowhere to be seen?
scene direction: where willow was standing, now buffy, dawn, and xander are standing. they can hear gnarl speaking, but can't see willow.
gnarl o.s.: poor little lamb all alone.
dawn: you guys hear that, right?
xander: yep.
buffy: it's echoing. i know it sounds close, but i don't think—
scene direction: gnarl jumps out suddenly and scratches dawn before leaving again.
buffy: dawn! are you ok?
dawn: i guess so.
scene direction: dawn sounds weak, uncovers her stomach to show a large gash across it
dawn: poison paralyzes.

scene direction: buffy mouthful of nuts
buffy: where'd you get the nuts?

buffy: yeah, i don't think we could call— wait, you saw willow?
anya: um-hmm. oh, she's looking for you, by the way. decided you might be out in some cave. sounded pretty tenuous.
scene direction: dawn without moving her lips
dawn: cave?
buffy: anya, listen. this is really important. did willow go to that cave?
anya: mm-hmm. last time i saw her, that's where she was headed.
scene direction: anya turning to dawn
anya: shall i make her salute? that'd be very cute.
buffy: xander, she could be there right now. willow could be trapped with the gnarl.
scene direction: anya playing with dawn's hand

scene direction: anya to buffy
anya: what's going on?
buffy: i don't know, but i'm starting to get why we haven't seen her.

buffy: close one.

anya: good. you're doing really good.

willow: buffy...
buffy: oh, i'm sorry. i didn't mean to interrupt.
willow: that's all i had left in me anyway.
buffy: i didn't realize meditating was such hard work.
willow: i'm healing. growing new skin.
scene direction: buffy walks toward willow
buffy: wow. that's magic, right? i mean, when most people when they meditate don't get extra skin, right. 'cause clem should, like, cut back.
scene direction: buffy sits on edge of bed
willow: it's magic. i'm drawing power from the earth to heal myself.
buffy: we're on the second floor.
scene direction: willow laughs
willow: you know giles says everything's part of the earth. this bed. the air. us.

scene direction: willow leans back, exhausted.
buffy: you're wiped out. i-i should go.
willow: no. please stay. i missed you so much when i couldn't find you.
buffy: we missed you too. i missed you. dawn's, uh, working on what caused the mutual no-see-ums, but so far we haven't—
willow: i did it.
buffy: you did a spell?
willow: i didn't mean to. i-i just remember thinking i wasn't ready to see you guys yet. i was afraid we wouldn't, you know, connect.
buffy: so, you made it happen just by thinking it?
willow: guess i have a ways to go before i master my powers, huh?
buffy: it's ok. as long as you're all right.
willow: it's nice to be forgiven. too bad i need so much of it.
buffy: i have a confession to make. i thought it might be you. with the flaying.
willow: i know.
buffy: i wanna be the kind of person that wouldn't think that. xander never thought it.
willow: he did, a little. heck, i did a little. xander has the luxury of not saying it, but you're the slayer. you have to say stuff like that. it's ok. it's ok too if you still don't think i can recover from this magic stuff, 'cause, honestly, i'm not that sure about it either.
scene direction: willow leans forward again, sighing, to begin meditating again.
buffy: i thought you were too tired.
willow: it hurts too much not to try.
buffy: i'm sorry.
willow: it just takes so much strength. i don't have that much.
buffy: i got so much strength, i'm giving it away.
willow: are you sure?
buffy: will it help?
willow: much.
scene direction: buffy sits cross-legged in front of willow and holds her hands. they meditate together.
buffy: good.
