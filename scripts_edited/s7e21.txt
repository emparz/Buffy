scene direction: faith yelling to the others, and ducking away
faith: get down!
scene direction: the box explodes in a massive fireball sending girls flying through the air.
scene direction: cut to 17 int. wine cellar at the shadow valley vineyards - day
scene direction: buffy stares at the shiny weapon stuck in the rock and walks up to it slowly. caleb opens the hatch and walks down the stairs into the room. buffy turns to look at him.
caleb: so...you found it. not impressed. 'cause the question now, girly girl, is can you pry it from solid rock before i come over there—
scene direction: buffy grabs the handle and pulls the weapon out of the stone one-handed with ease. she looks it over.
scene direction: caleb shocked
caleb: hmm. darn.
scene direction: caleb exhales worriedly

caleb: now, before you go hurting yourself with that thing, why don't you do yourself a courtesy and hand it over now?
scene direction: buffy cocks her head to the side
buffy: yeah? you want it?
scene direction: buffy hoists the weapon up casually
scene direction: caleb smiles nervously
caleb: you don't even know what you got there.
scene direction: caleb steps back
buffy: i know you're backing away.
caleb: you think wielding some 2-sided doo-dad's gonna make a difference?
scene direction: buffy/first shows up behind caleb frowning with her arms crossed.
first [buffy]: let her go, caleb.
scene direction: first [buffy] he hesitates
first [buffy]: i said let her go.
caleb: if i let her go, she slices me open with that thing.
first [buffy]: no, she doesn't. she hasn't got time. she has friends.
scene direction: first [buffy] buffy looks at her worriedly
first [buffy]: and her friends are in trouble. faith go boom.
caleb: i'm not letting her out of here with that thing.

scene direction: amanda calling around
amanda: hey! hey, faith! anybody! is anybody here?!
scene direction: caridad coughs
caridad: me!
scene direction: caridad stands
scene direction: amanda calling out
amanda: is anybody else alive?
caridad: hello? anyone?
vi: i'm
scene direction: vi coughs, then weakly
vi: i'm here!
scene direction: amanda and caridad go to vi, who's crouched in a corner. they help her to her feet.
caridad: who else we got?
vi: don't know.
amanda: you ok?
scene direction: amanda they help vi walk
vi: i think my arm is broken.
scene direction: vi sees girls lying under rubble, not moving; vi stares, shocked
vi: i guess i'm lucky.
scene direction: kennedy stands
kennedy: where's faith?
vi: i don't know.
kennedy: find her.
caridad: maybe we should get the hell out of this place. they could—
scene direction: kennedy emphatically
kennedy: find her!
scene direction: amanda and a couple other girls pull faith's unconscious body out of the water.
scene direction: vi turning away at the sight
vi: oh, god!
kennedy: is she alive?
amanda: breathing. pulse.
kennedy: we gotta get her out of here.
vi: which way is out?
amanda: there's other girls. there's more than faith. we don't even know how many of us are still—
scene direction: amanda the girls hear a distant growl; everyone stops to look
amanda: alive.
caridad: what was that?
vi: it could've been grinding metal. it could've been—
kennedy: no, it was one of them.
caridad: that's not possible.
amanda: how'd it get in here?
vi: plans?
kennedy: run.
scene direction: the girls run out of the room where the explosion happened and try to escape down the tunnels they came in.
caridad: oh, no! it's blocked!
scene direction: vi crying
vi: oh, my god!
amanda: i told you this wasn't the way!
kennedy: cut the chatter! up and over! wounded first! let's go!
scene direction: the girls climb over the debris blocking the tunnel. with all the wounded girls, it's taking too long. finally, when the last girl, vi, comes over the pile, a turok-han reaches for her. the girls scream and instinctively back away as they watch it climb over the pile and move toward them.
kennedy: group together. form a circle. nobody panic. it's all of us, one of him. we can take one of these things.
scene direction: as the girls stare at the turok-han coming over the pile of debris, another turok-han jumps down the steps beside them.
scene direction: cut to 20 int. dining room at buffy's house - day
scene direction: there's piles and piles of food on the dining room table. girls reach for the food as andrew empties it from a duffle bag.
andrew: it was pretty amazing. a whole grocery store just abandoned. food lying around everywhere. uh, the produce was on its way to funky town, but—
giles: ooh.
scene direction: giles grabs desperately for a package
giles: jaffa cakes.
scene direction: giles starts eating the cakes
andrew: uh, the apples still look pretty good, so everyone should, uh, check those out.
scene direction: the front door opens and willow, dawn, anya, and xander walk into the house.

scene direction: xander, anya, willow, dawn, giles and andrew walk into the living room.
andrew: but you did that spell with the little lights. the locator.
anya: it crapped out on us though.
dawn: no, it didn't...exactly.
willow: it just took us to an empty house. she must have moved on already.
giles: i'm afraid we have slightly worse news here. faith hasn't returned with the other girls. something's gone wrong.
andrew: i've been here, keeping morale up. because that's important.
scene direction: willow worried
willow: we have to go to her.
scene direction: xander nods
xander: guess so.
andrew: yes. i'll stay here, keep working on that morale thing.
scene direction: andrew sips a capri-sun drink
scene direction: cut to 22 int. tunnel - day
scene direction: the girls stare down the turok-han in front of them.
scene direction: kennedy holding her fists up in front of her
kennedy: remember the training. everybody, get ready!
scene direction: kennedy a turok-han sneaks up behind her and grabs her, knocking her down; she screams
kennedy: aah!
amanda: there's another one.
scene direction: kennedy frees herself from the turok-han that attacked her and backs away from it
kennedy: move! move! move! up and over!
scene direction: amanda to kennedy
amanda: not that one!
scene direction: amanda points her toward yet another turok-han
amanda: that one!
scene direction: the girls all scream as the three turok-hans advance toward them. they grab one of the girls.
caridad: weapons!
scene direction: caridad points
caridad: over there!
scene direction: kennedy runs to the weapons, but the turok-han have already begun ripping apart the girl they grabbed. one looks at kennedy, snarling, his face covered in the girl's blood. it charges toward kennedy who swings the weapon at the monster, but to no avail. the turok-han easily disarms her, grabs her by the neck, and lifts her off the ground choking her..
scene direction: a loud crash echoes through the room as something falls from the ceiling, allowing light to enter the room from above. buffy jumps down through the hole into the room carrying the weapon she got from the vineyard earlier. the turok-han drops kennedy and stalks toward buffy. buffy swings the weapon at the turok-han as it approaches her, and she uses the pointy end to stake first one turok-han, then the other. the third turok-han approaches her and knocks her down, but buffy tumbles forward, grabs her weapon, leaps to her feet, and beheads the last turok-han, turning it to dust before everyone's eyes.
scene direction: the girls who have been watching her stare incredulously at the sight of buffy in action. kennedy is panting, holding her neck.
scene direction: buffy looks at the girls
buffy: get the wounded. we're leaving.
kennedy: are there more?
buffy: there's always more. let's move.
scene direction: buffy walks out
scene change: fade to black.

scene direction: buffy's living room has been turned into an impromptu triage unit as the healthy ones treat the wounds of the girls hurt in the explosion.
scene direction: buffy sitting next to a wounded girl
buffy: will, come here. she's losing a lot of blood.
willow: got it.
scene direction: willow goes to the side of the girl buffy was attending
scene direction: giles and xander carry an unconscious faith through the front door and up the stairs. kennedy and amanda stand in the doorway, concerned, as buffy goes to supervise.
scene direction: buffy to giles and xander
buffy: the room upstairs is ready for her.
giles: good.
xander: i hope we're in time.
amanda: is she ok? is she gonna be ok?
scene direction: kennedy to amanda
kennedy: i'm sure she'll be fine,
scene direction: kennedy to buffy
kennedy: right?
xander: careful!
giles: just mind her head.
buffy: i'll be up in a second.
kennedy: you guys heal fast, right? you slayers?
scene direction: buffy goes back to the living room
buffy: yeah.
kennedy: so...she'll be ok?
buffy: i don't know.
caridad: what's with the axe thing?
buffy: i took it from caleb. it might be important.
vi: let's hope.
amanda: i think we got punished.
buffy: what?
scene direction: kennedy nervously
kennedy: we, uh...we followed her. and it was—
vi: it didn't work out.
buffy: you guys, it was a trap. it's not her fault. that could've just as easily happened to me.
scene direction: buffy vi shakes her head
caridad: so are you... are you, like, back?
buffy: i don't know. i guess i'm not leaving.
scene direction: buffy carries a first-aid kit and her new weapon to the stairs
kennedy: so, we got a plan now, or anything?
buffy: yeah, there's a plan. get ready. time's up.
scene direction: amanda to herself
amanda: i still think we got punished.
scene direction: cut to 24 int. buffy's room at buffy's house - day
scene direction: a couple of the potentials are standing around the edge of the room staring at faith as giles and xander place her on the bed. giles is taking her pulse. buffy walks into the room and seems shocked at the sight.
xander: is she breathing ok?
giles: still unconscious, though.
buffy: we've still got work to do.
scene direction: cut to 25 int. willow's room at buffy's house - day
scene direction: buffy addresses willow and giles.
buffy: i think it's maybe some kind of scythe. the only thing i know for sure is it made caleb back off in a hurry.
scene direction: willow giggles
willow: so it's true. scythe matters.
scene direction: willow pushes giles playfully
giles: and, ignoring that, i'd just like to point out this is really quite ingenious.
scene direction: giles plays with the weapon
buffy: kills strong bodies 3 ways.
willow: and you say you sense something when you hold it?
buffy: not much, but it's strong. and i knew it belonged to me. i just knew it.
scene direction: giles inspecting the weapon
giles: in addition to being ancient, it's clearly mystical.
buffy: yeah, i figured that one out when i king arthured it out of the stone.
willow: so maybe it's like some kind of traditional slayer weapon.
giles: i can't imagine how something like this could exist without my having heard of it.
buffy: well, the good guys are not traditionally known for their communication skills.
giles: right. um...
scene direction: giles sits on the bed
giles: any chance that it might be something other than a tool for killing things?
buffy: the first's guys clearly wanted it out of that stone. it's not just a tool. it's important. we need to find out whatever we can. who made it, when, why? does it have a name?
scene direction: buffy shrugs
buffy: i don't know, a credit report? just find out fast.
giles: we'll start work immediately.
willow: yeah, don't worry, buff. we'll find out everything there is to know.
scene direction: willow opens her laptop
buffy: good, because right now, that thing's all we've got going for us.
scene direction: cut to 26 int. living room at buffy's house - day
scene direction: andrew rips apart a bed sheet as he and anya attend to the wounded.
andrew: i liked the real bandages better. these bed sheets are awfully festive. ecch!
scene direction: anya bandaging a potential's shoulder
anya: yeah. they're gonna look like mortally wounded easter baskets.
scene direction: wounded potential groggily, alarmed at anya's words
wounded potential: what?
anya: aw.
scene direction: anya shrugs, swigs from a bottle
andrew: h-hey! we're supposed to use that to sterilize wounds. mr. giles said.
anya: come on, what does it really matter?
scene direction: anya hands bottle to andrew
andrew: hmm. good point.
scene direction: andrew takes a swig from the bottle
anya: giles knows his single malt antiseptics.
andrew: blech.
scene direction: andrew shakes his head
andrew: everything's horrible.
anya: yup. many of these girls will die. slaughterhouse is what it is.
scene direction: wounded potential alarmed at what she hears
wounded potential: what?
scene direction: anya tenderly
anya: oh...trying to talk will just kill you sooner.
andrew: we need supplies, and not just bandages and junk. these—these girls need stitches and painkillers.
anya: yeah, well, i could use a cookie, but i'm not making reckless wishes.
andrew: no, no. we can do it. the hospital. it's gotta be all abandoned like the grocery store. supplies just lying around for the taking.
scene direction: andrew anya shrugs, andrew stands
andrew: i'm going in.
scene direction: andrew takes a swig
scene direction: anya stands
anya: you are?
andrew: and you're coming with me.
anya: i am?
andrew: well, i think you should drive 'cause that scotch made me a little dizzy.
scene direction: anya smiles
anya: ok. i'll get kennedy to watch the girls. she's tough. imminent death won't bother her.
scene direction: wounded potential sits up, alarmed
wounded potential: what?
scene direction: cut to 27 int. buffy's kitchen at buffy's house - day
scene direction: buffy and xander are having a private chat in the kitchen.
buffy: you got it?
xander: wait. i'm not to the "got it" place yet. i'm still in the neighborhood of "you've gotta be kidding".
scene direction: buffy sighs
buffy: you know it's for the good.
xander: i don't. buffy, do you get that? if i do this, that's it for me for this fight. i feel like you're putting me out to pasture.
buffy: of course i'm not putting you out to pasture.
scene direction: buffy shakes her head
buffy: what does that even mean?
xander: well, you know, it's like, uh... when a cow gets old and loses an eye, or its ability to be milked, the farmer takes it and puts it in a different pasture so it won't have to... fight...with the priests.
scene direction: xander chuckles
xander: look, i don't need you to protect me.
buffy: i'm not.
xander: i got hurt, but i'm not done. i can still fight.
buffy: i know. that's why i need you to do this. xander, i need someone that i can count on no matter what happens.
scene direction: xander shakes his head
xander: i just always thought that i would... i would be there with you... you know, for the end.
scene direction: buffy indignant
buffy: hey.
scene direction: xander quickly
xander: well, not that this is the end.
buffy: thanks a lot.
xander: no, no, no. by the end, i meant, uh... a heroic, uplifting way. see, i'm still optimistic. you're just thrown off a little by this gritty-looking eye patch.
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: i know what you meant.
xander: i should be at your side. that's all i'm saying.
buffy: you will be. you're my strength, xander. you're the reason i made it this far. i trust you with my life. that's why i need you to do this for me.
scene direction: xander getting a little misty, sentimental
xander: ok.
scene direction: buffy breaks the mood jokingly
buffy: also, you can't shoot a bow and arrow anymore, and every time you pick up a sword, i worry that you're gonna break one of our good lamps.
xander: hey—
buffy: don't look at me. you're the one who said i'm gonna die.
scene direction: buffy walks toward the door
scene direction: xander follows
xander: i never said you were gonna die. i—i implied that you were gonna die. it's totally different.
buffy: yeah, ok. sure.
xander: besides, if you die, i'll just bring you back to life.
scene direction: xander shrugs
xander: that's what i do.
scene direction: cut to 28 int. willow's room at buffy's house - dusk
scene direction: buffy's weapon is leaning against the bed. willow and giles are talking in willow's room as willow researches on her laptop and giles flips through books.
willow: ok, before the vineyard was just, you know, a vineyard, it was a monastery. could've been put there then. some creepy monks messing with powers they don't understand.
giles: no, it's older than that. it's pre-christian.
scene direction: giles scratches his head
willow: ok. well, i found reference to stories the monks used to tell about something older. uh, like, some kind of pagan temple.
giles: native american?
willow: no. i don't know. ugh. ok, maybe we're just going about this the wrong way.
scene direction: willow her laptop screen shows a site entitled "history of the axe"
willow: maybe we should research the weapon itself. like...look. maybe it's the axe of dekeron, said to have been forged in hell itself. lost since the children's crusade, where it was said to have killed—
scene direction: willow sits back, makes a face
willow: oh. children. i hope that's not it.
giles: well, i have reference to the sword of moskva, the, uh...reaper of the tigris—how are we supposed to narrow this down? the illustrations are never clear enough.
scene direction: giles stands, leans on the window
giles: oh, damn. we're running out of time. we really haven't got anything useful.
scene direction: giles willow walks to the weapon and picks it up
giles: do you sense any of the power that buffy spoke about?
willow: gotta say no. must be a slayer thing.
scene direction: giles walks over to willow and sits on the edge of the bed
giles: tapping into magicks might help with that.
willow: maybe. but, i mean, if caleb is scared of this thing, it must be pretty dangerous. and tapping into that...
scene direction: willow puts the weapon down carefully
giles: willow, you could do it without endangering yourself.
scene direction: willow apprehensive
willow: if i tried something big, i'd change. and then it's all black hair and veins and lightning bolts. i can hardly do a locator spell without getting dark roots.
scene direction: giles softly
giles: and if it was necessary?
willow: honestly? i don't know.
scene direction: willow goes back to her computer
scene direction: giles sighs
giles: all right. do what you can. that's all any of us can do.
willow: i guess so. ugh. man, none of these sound right.
scene direction: willow scrolls down
willow: i mean, look. here's one that's just "m" question mark. what the heck is that?
scene direction: giles stands
giles: let me see.
scene direction: giles walks to look at the screen
giles: it's not a question mark. it's the international phonetics alphabet symbol for glottal stop.
willow: a whoey?
giles: it's sort of a gulping noise. i'm...remembering something here. um... ah. hieroglyphs. hieroglyphs stand for sets of consonants, as you know.
willow: yes, absolutely.
scene direction: giles paces
giles: "m" plus glottal stop is represented by a picture that's commonly thought to symbolize a sickle or a scythe. it's in thousands of carvings. in egypt, throughout the ancient world.
willow: carvings like you'd have on a pagan temple?
giles: go back. see what else we can find out about this temple.
scene direction: giles picks up the weapon
giles: the scythe is a symbol of death. let's see where these pagans buried their dead.
scene direction: cut to 29 ext. in front of buffy's house - night
scene direction: xander and dawn are rifling through xander's car.
dawn: xander, my crossbow is not out here. i told you, i don't leave crossbows around all willy-nilly.
scene direction: dawn pauses guiltily
dawn: not since that time with miss kitty fantastico.
xander: hey, did you know i have to take a driving test every year now?
dawn: because you're old?
xander: no, because of my eye. it's a whole state law. they don't trust my depth perception anymore.
dawn: that sucks.
scene direction: xander stands
xander: and you know what's even worse? all the stupid "it's all fun and games until someone loses an eye" jokes. "hey, xander, so no more fun and games, huh?"
scene direction: dawn rolls her eyes, sighs
dawn: giles was just having fun with you.
xander: that's not the point. it's an obvious joke. it'd be like someone calling me a cyclops.
dawn: oh.
scene direction: dawn giggles, then stops, clears throat
dawn: ok, so not that funny.
xander: i mean, uh... give me some "eye of the beholder" jokes. you know? or, uh... some "eye for an eye" jokes. or maybe even a post-modern "i, claudius" joke, you know? it's about standards, dawnie.
dawn: i know.
scene direction: dawn stands
xander: [sighs] just, uh, be creative.
dawn: look, everyone's still kind of on guard around you. but before you know it—
scene direction: dawn xander puts a cloth over her face, dawn screams
dawn: aah! aah!
scene direction: xander pushes dawn into the car and gets into the driver's seat before driving away.
scene direction: cut to 30 int. wine cellar at the shadow valley vineyards - night
scene direction: enraged, caleb throws a barrel across the room. it splits open and gushes red wine out onto the floor.
first [buffy]: not that i care personally, but you are wasting a lot of robust, full-bodied merlot.
caleb: why did you let her go? you know i can take her in a fight.
first [buffy]: we'll get her. calm down.
caleb: i'm calm. you should see me when i get angry.
first [buffy]: she's powerful right now. and you're weak.
caleb: you know, all of a sudden, i'm getting less calm.
first [buffy]: face it. your strength is waning. it has been quite some time since we've...
scene direction: first [buffy] looks at him seductively
first [buffy]: merged.
caleb: maybe you're right. ok, let's do it.
scene direction: caleb sniffs
first [buffy]: boy, you sure know how to romance a girl. no flowers, no dinner, no tour of the rectory. just, "ok, i'm ready. let's do it." help me. my knees are weak.
scene direction: first [buffy] rolls her eyes
caleb: watch what you say now. you're starting to sound like her. this is a sacred experience for me.
first [buffy]: and for me as well. look, when this is all over, and our armies spring forth, and our will sweeps the world, i will be able to enter every man, woman, and child on this earth, just as i enter you.
caleb: are you trying to make me jealous?
first [buffy]: i'm trying to make you a god.
scene direction: buffy/first and caleb are standing across from each other, facing each other, each holding out his hands and leaning his head back. the first changes form into the demonic apparition—huge, with two horns on its head and glowy red eyes (seen before when it entered willow in episode 7x10 "bring on the night"). the first lunges toward caleb, glowing and growling.
caleb: i am thy humble servant.
scene direction: the first's energy contracts into a beach-ball sized glowing light and enters caleb, causing him to wobble a little. he rolls back his head and falls to the ground; when he sits up again, his eyes are black and his voice is creepy and deeper.
caleb: and i am ready to serve thee.
scene change: fade to black.

buffy o.s.: you feel it too, don't you?
faith: damn. and damn, that's something.
buffy: i know.
faith: it's old. it's strong, and it feels like... like it's mine.
scene direction: faith places it on the bed beside her
faith: i guess that means it's yours.
buffy: it belongs to the slayer.
scene direction: buffy picks up the scythe
faith: slayer in charge, which, i'm guessing, is you.
scene direction: buffy sits on the edge of the bed
buffy: i honestly don't know. does it matter?
faith: it never mattered to me. somebody has to lead. let's vote for chao-ahn. it's harder to lead people into a deathtrap if you don't speak english.
buffy: it wasn't your fault.
scene direction: faith looks away
faith: i'm really not looking for forgiveness.
buffy: you're not?
faith: what do you want me to say? i blew it.
buffy: you didn't blow it.
faith: tell that to—
buffy: people die. you lead them into battle, they're gonna die. it doesn't matter how ready you are or how smart you are. war is about death. needless, stupid death.
faith: so, here's the laugh riot. my whole life i've been a loner.
buffy: that's the funny part? did i miss something?
faith: i'm trying to—
buffy: sorry. sorry. go.
faith: no ties, no buddies, no relationships that lasted longer than... well, robin lasted pretty long.
scene direction: faith grins
faith: boy's got stamina.
buffy: principal wood? and you? and in my—
scene direction: buffy stands, paces
faith: don't tell me you two got wriggly.
buffy: no. no. no, no. we're just good friends. or mortal enemies, depending on which day of the—
scene direction: was that the funny part?
faith: ok. the point. me, by myself all the time. i'm looking at you, everything you have, and, i don't know, jealous. then there i am. everybody's looking to me, trusting me to lead them, and i've never felt so alone in my entire life.
buffy: yeah.
scene direction: buffy swallows, looks down
faith: and that's you every day, isn't it?
buffy: i love my friends. i'm very grateful for them. but that's the price. being a slayer.
faith: there's only supposed to be one. maybe that's why you and i can never get along. we're not supposed to exist together.
buffy: also, you went evil and were killing people.
faith: good point. also a factor.
scene direction: faith nods
buffy: but you're right. i mean, i... i guess everyone's alone. but being a slayer? there's a burden we can't share.
faith: and no one else can feel it.
scene direction: faith beat
faith: thank god we're hot chicks with superpowers.
buffy: takes the edge off.
faith: comforting.
buffy: mm-hmm.

spike: honey, you're home.
buffy: yeah.
scene direction: spike sighs
spike: and you did it. fulfilled your mission. found the holy grail. or the holy hand grenade, or whatever the hell that is.
buffy: right now we're going with scythe. you like?
spike: well, pointy and wooden is not exactly the look i wanna know better, but it does have flair. can see why a girl would ditch a fella for one of these.
buffy: i'm sorry about that.
scene direction: buffy walks away

spike: it doesn't matter. you're back in the bosom. all's forgiven. and, uh,
scene direction: spike stands in front of buffy, looking at her
spike: last night...was just a glitch. a bit of cold comfort from the cellar dweller. let's don't make a thing out of it.
scene direction: spike breathes nervously
buffy: great. i have work to do.
spike: oh, yeah. another solo mission, of course.
buffy: yeah, it is.
spike: that's fine. you don't have to get shirty about it.
buffy: i'm not shirty. and what is shirty? that's not even a word.
spike: all right. all right. big secret mission. it's fine.
buffy: it's not a secret. well, i mean, it is, but that's the point of the mission. find out the secret. this thing was forged by— i don't even know. i mean, something about... a tomb on unconsecrated ground. that's what i have to do. i need to find out what this is and why i have it.
spike: and that's the thing the preacher man was so anxious to keep out of your mitts?
buffy: that it is.
spike: well, maybe i'll swing by the vineyard when you go, make sure he's sitting tight.
buffy: great.
spike: ok.
scene direction: spike turns to leave
scene direction: buffy walks after him
buffy: you're a dope.
spike: i'm a what?
buffy: you're a dope. and a bonehead. and you're shirty.
spike: have you gone completely carrot-top?
buffy: do you see this?
scene direction: buffy holds up the scythe
buffy: this may actually help me fight my war. this might be the key to everything. and the reason i'm holding it is because of you. because of the strength that you gave me last night. look, i am tired of defensiveness and weird, mixed signals. you know, i have faith for that. let's just get to the truth here, ok? i don't know how you felt about last night, but i will not—
scene direction: spike breathes in, looks away
spike: terrified.
buffy: of what?
scene direction: spike lets out a slow sigh
spike: last night was...
scene direction: spike looks up
spike: god, i'm such a jerk. i can't do this.
buffy: spike...
spike: it was the best night of my life. if you poke fun at me, you bloody well better use that, 'cause i couldn't bear it. it may not mean that much to you, but—
buffy: i just told you it did.
scene direction: spike sighs
spike: yeah...i hear you say it, but... i've lived for soddin' ever, buffy. i've done everything. done things with you i can't spell, but... i've never... been close... to anyone. least of all, you. 'til last night. all i did was...
scene direction: spike smiles
spike: hold you, watch you sleep. and it was the best night of my life. so, yeah... i'm... terrified.
buffy: you don't have to be.
scene direction: spike looks at her
spike: were you there with me?
scene direction: buffy looks straight at him
buffy: i was.
spike: what does that mean?
buffy: i don't know. does it have to mean something?
spike: no.
scene direction: spike looks away
spike: not right now.
buffy: maybe when...
spike: no.
scene direction: spike throws up his hand
spike: let's just leave it.
buffy: ok.: spike:
scene direction: buffy sighs
buffy: we'll go be heroes.
scene direction: buffy walks out the door
scene direction: cut to 34 int. hospital supply room - night
scene direction: andrew and anya walk into the supply room carrying bags over their shoulders.
andrew: ooh. this one has oxygen tanks.
anya: they'd only be useful if something big was attacking, and then we could shove one down their throat and blow 'em up like roy scheider did with that shark in jaws.
scene direction: anya andrew stares at her
anya: what?
andrew: you are the perfect woman.
anya: i've often thought so. wanna rob?
andrew: let's rob.
scene direction: andrew they walks to the shelves and rifle through things
andrew: oh, cool. gauze and alcohol... tape and, oh, sutures, if we want to get stitchy with it. oh, and there's a... box of ointment here. i used one of these on a rash once.
anya: oh. show me.
andrew: well, it—it's healed up, but it was red and crusty with these little itchy places.
anya: show me the box full of ointments, you little freak. and get cotton packing for the big wounds.
andrew: it's gonna be bad, isn't it?
anya: yeah.
scene direction: andrew sighs
andrew: so how come you're here? i mean, you could just go. right?
anya: yeah. i did once before.
andrew: before what?
anya: well...there was this other apocalypse... this one time, and... well, i took off. but this time, i don't...i don't know.
scene direction: andrew sighs
andrew: well...what's different?
anya: well...i guess i was...kinda new to bein' around humans before. but now i've... seen a lot more, gotten to know people... seen what they're capable of, and...
scene direction: anya shrugs
anya: i guess i just realized...how amazingly screwed-up they all are. i mean really, really screwed-up in a monumental fashion.
andrew: oh.
scene direction: andrew nods
anya: and they have no purpose that unites them, so they just drift around, blundering through life until they die...which they...they know is coming, yet every single one of them is surprised when it happens to them. they're incapable of thinking about what they want beyond the moment. they kill each other, which is clearly insane. and yet, here's the thing. when it's something that really matters, they fight. i mean, they're lame morons for fighting, but they do. they never... never quit. so i guess i will keep fighting, too.
scene direction: andrew sighs
andrew: that was kind of beautiful.
scene direction: andrew anya nods
andrew: you...you love humans.
scene direction: anya indignant
anya: i do not.
andrew: yes, you do. you loooove them
anya: stop it! i don't love them! and i'll kill you if you tell anybody.
andrew: i won't tell anybody. won't get a chance to, anyway.
anya: i don't know. you might survive.
andrew: no, you might survive. you know how to handle a weapon, and you've been in this world for, like, a thousand years. i'm not so...
scene direction: andrew sighs
andrew: i don't think i'll be ok. i'm cool with it. i think i'd like to...finish out as one of those... lame humans tryin' to do what's right.
scene direction: andrew smiles
anya: yeah.
scene direction: anya nods
andrew: so...wheelchair fight?
scene direction: andrew and anya are sitting in wheelchairs wheeling toward each other making indian calls and being silly.
scene direction: cut to 35 ext. cemetery - night
scene direction: buffy walks through a cemetery carrying the scythe. she opens a gate and walks up to a pyramid shaped tomb and kicks down the door.
scene direction: cut to 36 int. pyramidal tomb - night
scene direction: buffy walks down into the tomb. it's lit inside, although dimly, by torches, giving it an orange hue. buffy looks around cautiously. a woman's voice comes from behind a drape.
woman o.s.: i'd forgotten. i'd forgotten how young you would be.
scene direction: the woman opens the drape, and buffy sees a very old woman with long white hair standing before her.
woman: comes from the waiting. mind plays tricks. i see you've found our weapon.
buffy: who are you?
woman: one of many. well...time was. now i'm alone in the world.
buffy: so what are you? some kind of ghost?
scene direction: woman chuckles softly, shakes her head
woman: nope. i'm as real as you are. just...well... let me put it this way— i look good for my age. i've been waiting.
scene direction: woman holds out her hands; buffy hands over the scythe
woman: you pulled it out of the rock. i was one of those who put it in there.
buffy: what is it?
scene direction: woman admires the scythe
woman: a weapon. a scythe. forged in secrecy for one like you who— i'm sorry. what's your name?
buffy: buffy.
woman: no, really.
scene direction: woman buffy shrugs
woman: we forged it in secrecy and kept it hidden from the shadow men, who—
buffy: yeah. met those guys. didn't really care too much for 'em.
woman: ahh, yes. then you know. and they became the watchers. and the watchers watched the slayers. but we were watching them.
buffy: oh! so you're like... what are you?
woman: guardians. women who want to help and protect you. we forged this centuries ago, halfway around the world.
buffy: hence, the luxor casino theme.
woman: forged there, it was put to use right here...to kill the last pure demon that walked upon the earth. the rest were already driven under. and then there were men here, and then there were monks. and then there was a town, and now there was you. and the scythe remained hidden.
buffy: i don't understand. how is it possible that we didn't know any of this?
woman: we hid, too. we had to until now. we're the last surprise.
buffy: does this mean i can win?
woman: that is really up to you. this is a powerful weapon.
scene direction: woman hands the scythe back to buffy
buffy: yeah.
woman: but you already have weapons.
buffy: oh.
woman: use it wisely and perhaps you can beat back the rising dark. one way or another, it can only mean an end is truly near.
scene direction: the woman's head cocks slightly to the side, and a cracking noise can be heard. the woman falls to the ground. buffy looks up and sees caleb standing there.
caleb: i'm sorry. i didn't catch that last part on account of her neck snapping and all. did she say the end is near... or here?
scene change: fade to black.
scene change: *** act iv ***

xander: um, i thought you might say that.
scene direction: dawn sluggish
dawn: actually i meant to say what the hell happened?
xander: it was chloroform.
scene direction: dawn groggily
dawn: color forms...what?

xander: away.
scene direction: xander hands dawn a letter
dawn: what's this?
xander: just open it.
scene direction: dawn opens the letter and starts reading.
buffy v.o.: dearest dawn, don't be angry with xander. he only did what i told him to do. this isn't the place for either of you. please know that i love you and that everything i do is for you. i promised once to show you this beautiful world, and i'm going to do everything i can to make that happen—
scene direction: without letting xander see it, dawn puts a stun gun up to xander's neck and presses the button, zapping xander and knocking him out. the car swerves and dawn takes the wheel, guiding the car to a stop. she takes over the wheel and turns the car around.

caleb: you know, i gave you ample warning. told you not to interfere, but you chose not to heed.
scene direction: buffy charges toward caleb, but he deflects her and throws her onto a sarcophagus. she kicks him. he picks her up by the lapels and swings her body into a stone pillar so hard that it moves one of the stones out of place. buffy falls to the ground, and caleb picks up the scythe.
caleb: i was kind of hoping it'd go this way.
scene direction: caleb rears back with the scythe as he stares at buffy

angel: god, i missed watching this.
scene direction: buffy swings the scythe at caleb, slicing his stomach. he stumbles back, laughs heartily, wags his finger at her, and falls to the floor.
