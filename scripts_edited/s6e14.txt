scene direction: open on a small table with several stakes and daggers on it.
scene direction: reveal buffy who begins putting the weapons into a bag. we're in the summers living room. dawn stands behind buffy.
scene direction: buffy sighs
buffy: i'm sorry.
dawn: it's okay.
buffy: no, we're gonna sit down and have a real dinner. someday. i hate having to run out in the middle, it's just, you know, there's this thing out there. definitely non-vampire.
scene direction: dawn smiling
dawn: i understand.
scene direction: buffy picks up the bag, goes toward the door.
dawn: well, maybe when you get back we can set up for your party tomorrow.
buffy: yeah. uh, this could take a while though, i-i wouldn't wait up.
scene direction: buffy putting on her coat
buffy: besides, willow promised to be on birthday patrol, so there's nothing left for us to do.
scene direction: buffy smiling
dawn: right.
buffy: okay, so, finish dinner, homework, and don't stay up too late, all right?
dawn: okay.
buffy: okay.
scene direction: buffy turns to go. dawn watches with a smile. as soon as the door closes behind buffy, dawn stops smiling. stands there, alone, looking unhappy.
scene change: cut to graveyard, night. buffy walks along holding a large axe with a metal handle.
scene direction: suddenly a large demon with red skin and a spiny crest on its head leaps out behind her. buffy whirls around. the demon swings a large sword at her. she ducks, then blocks with her axe.
scene direction: the demon's sword bends the axe handle, then pulls it out of buffy's hand. it flies off and lands in the ground.
scene direction: the demon swings at buffy again and she gets hold of his sword arm, twists it around behind his back. suddenly the demon shimmers and disappears.
scene direction: buffy looks around in confusion.
scene direction: the demon reappears behind her. she kicks him in the face, punches him, kicks again. he falls back. his sword goes flying up into the air.
scene direction: buffy catches the sword on its way down. the demon charges her. she stabs him right in the stomach. blue light flashes out in a circle from the wound. the demon roars and grabs his stomach.
scene direction: buffy pulls the sword out and falls back onto the ground. the sword lands point-down in the ground.
scene direction: the demon falls to his knees, still roaring. he shimmers and turns into a bolt of silver light that shoots over to the sword and into it. we can see his face reflected in the sword's blade.
scene direction: buffy is still on the ground, facing the other way.
buffy: run off, huh? afraid to face a true warrior?
scene direction: she gets up and sees the sword.
buffy: ooh, shiny.
scene direction: she smiles, pulls the sword out of the ground and twirls it around. walks off, holding it.
scene direction: wolf howl, opening credits.
scene change: *** act i ***
scene direction: open in the magic shop. anya stands by the shelves dusting statues.
anya: do you think we should set up lots of candles for buffy's party tomorrow?
scene direction: pan over to reveal xander and willow sitting at a small round table doing paperwork.
xander: not if they're that horrible slug kind you keep trying to unload.
scene direction: anya walking past
anya: i don't know why people get so turned off by slug.
xander: honey, slugs get turned off by slug.
scene direction: xander to willow
xander: oh, actually, i wanted to talk to you about that.
willow: slugs?
xander: no, the party. or, tara ... at the party.
willow: oh.
xander: it's just ... buffy really wants her there. it seems important to her, so i told her i'd ask you.
scene direction: willow smiling
willow: oh ... yeah, of course, she should totally be there. it'll be great.
scene direction: dawn enters. she wears a red t-shirt with a beige sweater over it, and has a red coat over her arm.
scene direction: dawn smiling
dawn: hey!
willow: hey, dawnie. buffy, uh, out patrolling already?
scene direction: willow dawn nods
xander: so, uh, anything new about warren and the nerd herd?
dawn: no, just a big monster hunt.
xander: man, a nerd goes into hiding, he really goes into hiding.
dawn: does anybody want to come to the mall with me for birthday presents?
willow: oh, i would, honey, but ... i've got my group. you know, the whole spellcasters anonymous thing? we're still looking for a better name.
dawn: oh. well, yeah, uh, no, that-that's good. you should ... do that.
scene direction: dawn beat
dawn: so what about you guys?
anya: stuck in doing-the-books-ville.
xander: aw, i'd love to go with you, but i gotta finish this new shift schedule for the crew by tomorrow morning.
scene direction: dawn looks disappointed.
willow: sorry, it just looks like one of those nights. you know?
dawn: yeah.
willow: you okay going on your own?
dawn: yeah. somehow i'll, uh, manage to pull it off.
scene direction: willow gives her a little smile. dawn grimaces, turns to leave.
scene change: cut to overhead shot of sunnydale, night.
scene change: cut to exterior shot of the summers house.
scene change: cut to inside. dawn enters the front door, cautiously, looking around. she is wearing the red coat.
scene direction: pan across the foyer into the empty dining room.
dawn: buffy?
scene direction: dawn starts up the stairs.
scene change: cut to dawn's bedroom. overhead shot of dawn as she enters, closes the door behind her, turns on the light. she puts her purse on the bed and reaches into her coat pockets.
scene change: cut to a closer shot as she pulls a handful of jewelry from the pockets, still with the price tags attached. she looks at the handful for a moment, puts it on the bed, takes out another handful of jewelry and puts that on the bed too. she takes off her red coat, revealing a tight shiny leather jacket that she wears over the red t-shirt.
scene direction: she goes over to the closet, opens the door revealing a full-length mirror. she checks out the jacket in the mirror. we can see the price tag still hanging from the sleeve. she pulls the jacket tightly around her.
scene change: cut to high school classroom, next day. pan across bored students.
teacher: ...if we can come up with things jim lost during his years in shanghai, and things he gained.
scene direction: teacher shot of dawn doodling

teacher: who wants to- a student comes in and gives the teacher a piece of paper.
teacher: dawn.
scene direction: dawn looks up, alarmed.
teacher: they need you in the guidance office.
scene direction: dawn continues looking alarmed as she gathers up her stuff.
scene change: cut to long shot of dawn walking down an empty hall lined with lockers.
guidance counselor voiceover: i'm sorry, i didn't mean to scare you.
scene change: cut to the outside of the office. through opened venetian blinds we can see dawn sitting across the desk from the guidance counselor woman.
guidance counselor: just a follow-up after your ... your loss. and since i'm new here, i thought it would give us a chance to know each other.
scene change: cut to inside the office. the guidance counselor is a fairly young woman wearing a small blue pendant around her neck.
dawn: great.
guidance counselor: so, i've been looking through your file
scene direction: guidance counselor shuffling papers on her desk
guidance counselor: and, um ... your grades have slipped a little.
dawn: i have really hard classes this quarter.
guidance counselor: yeah, still. teachers say that you seem a little distracted lately.
dawn: i'm not. i-i'm fine.
guidance counselor: okay. it's just, you know, i know it must seem weird,
scene direction: guidance counselor small laugh
guidance counselor: talking to a stranger about stuff, but, um ... i want you to know that if something's going on, something's up, my job ... the most important part of my job ... is looking out for you.
scene direction: she smiles. dawn looks surprised, returns a very small smile of her own.
dawn: i'm really okay.
scene direction: the counselor nods slowly, sits back.
guidance counselor: i know there's been ... a lot of loss.
scene direction: dawn looks down.
scene direction: dawn quietly
dawn: yeah. kinda.
scene direction: dawn looks up
dawn: i-i mean, yes. people keep ... people have a tendency to go away ... and, i miss them. and sometimes ... i wish i could just make them stop. going away.
scene direction: the counselor smiles. dawn pauses, waves her hands dismissively.
dawn: but seriously, it's, it's no big deal. i'm fine.
scene change: cut to close shot on a table laden with several trays of hors d'oeuvres.
scene direction: xander os
xander: we're feeding an army!
scene direction: buffy os
buffy: no, they couldn't make it.
scene direction: pan out to reveal that it's the island in buffy's kitchen. anya is preparing the food while buffy sits opposite. xander stands beside anya.
xander: so, who's coming, you invite anyone else?
buffy: just you guys. willow, tara. the gang. oh, and sophie from work.
scene direction: xander and anya look at her, exchange a look.
buffy: what? like i'm one of those losers who can't make friends outside her tight little circle? no. i'm friendly. we bonded instantly. peas in a pod. bonded peas.
anya: really? um, what's sophie's last name?
scene direction: buffy thinks for a moment, frowns.
scene direction: buffy pouting
buffy: okay, shut up.
xander: don't worry about it, we're all over the new friend thing.
scene direction: xander anya smiling

scene direction: dawn entering
dawn: for buffy? really?
scene direction: dawn smiling
xander: ahh, don't worry, it's not a setup.
scene direction: anya grinning

scene direction: anya buffy looking annoyed
anya: and if you happen to form- xander: ahn- anya: -a romantic relationship leading to babies- xander: ahn- anya: -and many double dates with us so we have someone else to talk to, yay!
scene direction: xander looks uncomfortable.
buffy: i assume this was an act of kindness?
scene direction: buffy xander looking embarrassed
buffy: that'll help with the not throttling.
scene direction: buffy gives xander a meaningful look. he gives a fake laugh.
xander: hey, i'm just gonna get this stuff out there, people should be here soon.
scene direction: he picks up some of the food.
scene change: cut to the foyer, later. buffy opens the door to reveal tara, holding a small gift box.
buffy: hey! you made it!
scene direction: they smile and hug.
tara: of course, sweetie.
scene direction: tara pulls back
tara: so, how're you doing?
buffy: oh, you know. better. mostly.
scene direction: buffy tara looking sympathetic
buffy: sometimes.
tara: so, is, um...
scene direction: tara looks around
tara: spike coming?
buffy: no. he may be a chip-head, but ... he still doesn't play too well with others.
scene direction: tara smiles, turns to put down the gift and hang up her coat.
buffy: besides, i'm definitely not ready to, to...
scene direction: tara turns back
tara: come out.
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: yeah. i'm all ... stay-inny.

tara: i-i'm gonna get something to drink.
willow: oh, yeah, great. you should.
scene direction: tara exits toward the kitchen.
scene direction: willow muttering to herself
willow: you don't wanna get thirsty.
scene change: cut to the kitchen. buffy is filling paper cups from a large pitcher. tara enters.
buffy: hey, how did it- tara: yes please.
scene direction: tara takes a cup from buffy's hand and drinks. buffy looks surprised.
scene direction: knocking at the back door. buffy stands up.
scene direction: spike enters, holding a 6-pack of beer under one arm. someone else enters behind him but we can't see who it is.
scene direction: buffy surprised
buffy: spike.
spike: yeah. willow mentioned the shindig ... figured we're all part of the team.
scene direction: we see that spike still has a large bruise over one eye from being beaten by buffy in "dead things." buffy gives tara a nervous look.
spike: thought i'd, uh, swing by.
scene direction: reveal the other person behind spike. it's the loose-skinned demon from the poker game in "life serial." buffy frowns.
buffy: wait, what kind of team is this?
demon: hi. we met once before.
buffy: yes, yes we did.
spike: you know, more, merrier, that whole thing.
scene direction: demon to tara
demon: hi, i'm clement. clem.

scene direction: buffy smiling

xander: he was wondering where the best place was to park his car.
buffy: oh, that's easy, just

scene direction: buffy to tara
buffy: i'll be right back.
scene direction: over richard's shoulder, buffy looks at spike. he raises one eyebrow.
scene direction: buffy takes richard's arm and leads him toward the front. richard pauses in the doorway.
scene direction: richard whispers
richard: uh ... the guy with the...
buffy: skin condition. he doesn't like to talk about it.
scene direction: buffy leads richard away.
spike: stupid git!
scene direction: spike closing the back door
tara: i don't know. he seemed ... cute. w-was he cute? i mean, i'm not a very good judge, but...
scene direction: spike scowls.
scene direction: tara grinning

scene direction: clem agreeably
clem: i think he seemed cute, yeah.
scene direction: spike gives them both a look of outrage.
scene change: cut to the living room. xander sits on the sofa; dawn and anya stand nearby.
dawn: if we get buffy, can, can she start on opening the presents? it's been enough time, hasn't it?
anya: not yet, sweetie.
xander: i think buffy's busy right now.
scene direction: anya as if talking to a small child
anya: buffy's making a new friend. a grown-up friend.
dawn: what, you mean the guy you invited to set her up with?
anya: nothing.
dawn: it's not like i don't understand why you invited him. i was there, remember? i can hear you when i'm in the room, you know?
scene direction: dawn anya just nodding
dawn: i do understand these things.
scene direction: anya patronizing

scene change: cut to buffy coming down from upstairs. spike intercepts her in the foyer and backs her into a corner.
spike: you wanna slip away for a minute, luv?
buffy: what?
spike: i'll let you blow out my candles.
buffy: here. now? i don't think so.
spike: oh, what, you worried about richard? you don't wanna make your new boyfriend jealous, huh?
scene direction: buffy grinning
buffy: shut up. he's ... sweet.
scene direction: spike teasing
spike: "oh, shut up, he's sweet." buffy: maybe he's not the jealous one.
scene direction: spike looks surprised. buffy moves past him and away.
spike: you think he'll take you out on his ten-speed, pet?
scene direction: spike to himself
spike: maybe he'll let you ride in that little basket in the front.
scene direction: spike scoffs
spike: jealous my ass.
scene direction: he sighs, looks around in frustration.
scene change: cut to later. buffy sits on the sofa, looking skeptically at a device with a large head with two round knobs on it.
buffy: uh...
scene direction: we see willow sitting on buffy's right. dawn sits on buffy's left, fidgeting very obviously.
willow: see? i-it's a battery-operated back massager. and it's portable so you can take it with you on patrol.
scene direction: buffy dubious
buffy: wow.
scene direction: willow smiling
willow: it's like, instant gratification for all your little acheys.
scene direction: buffy looks over at spike leaning in the doorway.
scene direction: spike raises his eyebrow and gives his best suggestive smirk.
scene direction: buffy quickly
buffy: great! thanks!
scene direction: buffy puts the massager aside
buffy: uh, what's next?
scene direction: dawn excited
dawn: here, do mine.

scene direction: dawn smiling
dawn: do you like it?

scene direction: buffy looks at the jacket, frowns.
scene direction: close shot on the sleeve which has the security tag attached.
buffy: i-it still has the security tag on it.
scene direction: dawn looks alarmed, covers quickly.
dawn: huh. that's so weird. i can't believe they didn't take that off.
scene direction: buffy stares at her.
scene direction: xander os
xander: happy birthday, buffy!
scene direction: everyone turns to see xander and anya wheeling in a large wooden chest.
buffy: oh my god!
scene direction: xander and anya place the chest in the middle of the room and gesture proudly.
buffy: did you guys make that?
scene direction: buffy gets up, thrusting the box with the jacket into dawn's lap. dawn looks dismayed.
anya: uh, well, uh, xander did the building.
scene direction: anya dawn still looking upset
anya: i offered helpful suggestions while observing from a safe distance.
scene direction: buffy kneels down to open the chest. xander holds the lid open and leans over to speak softly so richard won't hear.
xander: holds basic weapons,
scene direction: xander buffy smiling
xander: plus a few non-basic ones too.
scene direction: xander loudly
xander: plus, there's a handsome cd holder.

scene direction: buffy anya nodding
scene direction: sophie walking into the living room
sophie: hey. uh, my mom told me to say thank you right away, 'cause, otherwise i usually forget. so, thank you.
scene direction: buffy and anya listen to this politely. we see spike in the background watching.
sophie: and, also, um, i can't have any, any chocolate, or, or peanuts or egg yolks.
scene direction: anya whispers to buffy
anya: is this the friend you brought from work?
buffy: yes.
sophie: a-and sometimes dairy.
buffy: no problem.

scene direction: buffy os
buffy: sophie, this is anya ... and willow...
scene direction: shot from on the porch looking in. dawn stands in the doorway, looks unhappily back at the party, then outside. slowly, she closes the door.
scene direction: pan across the outside of the door to the porch. dawn's guidance counselor walks out of the shadows, on the porch. she walks over to the front door, smiling slightly.
scene direction: she stops walking and her face morphs into demon-face -- she is halfrek. she speaks in her deep resonant demon voice (see episode "doublemeat palace").
halfrek: wish granted.
scene direction: blackout.
scene change: *** act ii ***
scene direction: open on the party. loud rock music is playing. pan across sophie and clem dancing together. pan across willow sitting in a chair with xander sitting on its arm, both talking and moving to the beat. pan to the sofa where anya sits waving her hand to the beat. dawn sits beside her, looking bored.
scene direction: zoom in on dawn. she looks like she's trying to pretend she's enjoying herself. she experiments with a couple of different smiles.
scene change: cut to the foyer. buffy comes out of the dining room and encounters richard in the hall.
richard: hey.
buffy: hi.
richard: great party. everyone's havin' fun.
scene direction: buffy smiling
buffy: i hope so.
richard: i mean, look what time it is and no one's even thinking about leaving. i, uh ... can't tear myself away.

buffy: stop it. someone's gonna see.
scene direction: she walks toward the kitchen. spike follows, stops her at the doorway, putting one hand on the wall beside her head to block her way.
spike: mm-hmm.
scene direction: he puts his other hand on her shoulder, runs it down her arm, takes her hand and pulls it onto his thigh.
scene direction: someone appears at the other end of the hall. buffy quickly pulls her hand back as both she and spike look over.
scene direction: it's tara, looking a bit taken aback.
scene direction: buffy glances at spike, pushes past him and exits toward the kitchen.
scene direction: spike looks at tara with a slightly nervous smile. tara looks innocent.
spike: i had ... a ... muscle cramp. buffy was, uh, helping.

buffy: there's something keeping us in this house.

scene direction: shot of dawn looking up at that, looking upset.
scene direction: spike softly
spike: things we'd rather be doing.
buffy: i think the first priority has to be to find a way out.
dawn: sure. of course you all wanna leave.
scene direction: dawn buffy looking at her
dawn: 'cause being stuck in here with me, that would really suck, right?
scene direction: buffy frowns slightly.

scene direction: dawn sits up, turns to face them.
scene direction: dawn angrily
dawn: what would i know?
willow: look, we're not accusing you of anything, it's just ... you were kind of taking it personal down there.
dawn: oh. okay. so you've all just decided that somehow i'm responsible.
scene direction: dawn sourly
dawn: great. here's me baskin' in the love.
xander: no, it's just, you know, you're upset 'cause we all wanna leave. and now we can't leave. only thing missing is a cornfield. there ... there isn't a cornfield, is there?
buffy: dawnie, it's okay. you know, we're not gonna be mad.
dawn: yeah, only i didn't do anything!
willow: you sure?
dawn: you want me to ask my other self?
buffy: dawn, we're just trying to figure out what's going on.
scene direction: dawn angrily
dawn: figure it out yourself. i'm done being talked to like a kid.
xander: well, 'cause you know, sometimes we do something that seems like a good idea at the time, like, say, invoke the power of a musical amulet? and it turns out, you know, not so much.
dawn: god! i didn't do anything! i wish i had.
scene direction: dawn buffy frowning
dawn: i'm glad you're trapped.
scene direction: dawn very angrily
dawn: how else can i get anybody to spend any time with me?

buffy: i know. i just can't figure out why she didn't come to me.
xander: well, you have been a little busy lately.
scene direction: xander and anya look at buffy. she looks grim.
spike: hey, i don't wanna keep you all from the touchy-feelies, but maybe the encounter group can meet later. say, when we're not trapped in a house.
tara: even if dawn does know something, she's obviously not gonna help us right now. we need another way.

buffy: okay, so maybe 'soon' was a bit of an overstatement.
spike: so, you ever think about *not* celebrating a birthday? just to try it, i mean.
buffy: i'm gonna go check upstairs. keep an eye on things down here?
scene direction: spike nods. buffy turns to go.

anya: he's gonna die. he's gonna die, and we're gonna watch.
xander: ahn...
anya: and we're just sitting here. why are we just sitting here? why aren't we doing something?

scene direction: buffy turns to face her.
buffy: what did you want?
scene direction: dawn softly
dawn: nothing.
buffy: dawn, come on.
dawn: no. you don't know! you have this thing you do. you have all these friends.
scene direction: dawn softly
dawn: you have no idea what it's like.
buffy: what are you talking about? i don't know what, what- dawn: being alone!
buffy: you're not alone!
dawn: then why do i feel like this?
scene change: cut to the dining room. tara and spike standing next to each other.

scene direction: anya tara frowning
anya: i mean, not everything.
scene direction: anya looks at willow
anya: not exactly.
scene direction: anya willow looking nervous
anya: we're sitting here with an incredibly powerful witch ... much more powerful than you, tara, i'm sorry ... only no one seems willing to say it.
willow: i can't.
anya: no, see, that's not exactly true either.
scene direction: anya angrily
anya: not can't, won't.
willow: you don't know how much i hate this. i don't know if there's even ... anything i could do.
anya: yes ... and a good way to find out is to sit around and try nothing. that was sarcasm, by the way.
spike: look- willow: it's dangerous.
anya: and so is all of us dying!
xander: will ... look, i don't wanna gang up on you ... but anya kinda has a point.
scene direction: xander willow looking anxious
xander: we brought you back from it once. we're all here, it's just one little spell,
scene direction: xander spike shaking his head

dawn: it wasn't my idea. i didn't even know we had guidance counselors. she called me out of class like i was a total j.d.
buffy: and you'd ... never met her before?
dawn: no, not until yesterday.
buffy: and ... she got you to start talking about things that bothered you at home?
scene direction: dawn uncertain
dawn: uh ... yeah?
buffy: you didn't, by any chance, happen to ... express like a, a wish, or-or something, to her?
scene direction: dawn nervous
dawn: um ... maybe just a little.
scene direction: sound of thumping and crashing. dawn and buffy look up, both jump up.

buffy: oh.

scene direction: shot of all the others gathering around.
buffy: look, i-i don't think she- i don't think it's all her fault, okay? she ... there was a guidance counselor, or someone pretending to be a guidance counselor, she, she made dawn make a wish.
anya: guidance counselor? you made a wish to someone you've never seen before?
scene direction: dawn nervous

halfrek: what?
scene direction: halfrek laughs

halfrek: honestly, anyanka, you used to know better.
scene direction: anya coming closer
anya: how could you? why would you do this?

scene direction: spike still frowning
spike: not really.
scene direction: shot of buffy looking confused.
tara: i thought vengeance demons only punished men who wronged women.
halfrek: oh, that was anya's little raison d'être. most of us try to be a little more well-rounded. and actually, we prefer 'justice demon.' okay? fyi.
anya: well-rounded, huh? is that how you explain your thing for bad parents?
halfrek: oh, it's not a thing. the children need me.
anya: hmm!
scene direction: anya coughing
anya: addy issue
scene direction: anya coughing
halfrek: sling all the little barbs at me that you want, anyanka, it doesn't change the fact that this girl was in pain,
scene direction: halfrek pointing at dawn
halfrek: and none of you could hear it.
scene direction: halfrek dawn looks down
halfrek: i could hear her crying out everywhere i went in this town.
