scene direction: dawn is helping willow unpack her things. she's moving in to buffy's old room.
dawn: my advice to you is do exactly what everyone else does all the time.
willow: got it.
dawn: do what everyone else does, wear what everyone else wears, say what everyone else says.
willow: ok.: dawn: people may say something to you you don't understand. just don't be afraid to keep your mouth shut and pretend like you know what they're saying.
scene direction: willow laughs
willow: you know, dawn, i've been to college before.
dawn: people may say something like "my protein window closes in an hour." just nod and smile. mm-hmm. turns out it has something to do with fitness.
scene direction: buffy and xander enter the room, carrying boxes.
buffy: have you talked to her lately?
xander: not since that night with the gnarl demon. and that wasn't exactly the kind of "how have you been" kind of talk. more of the "pierce its eye with something sharp" kind of talking. i'm thinking i should call her.
buffy: i just don't want you to get your hopes up.
xander: hopes? oh, no, no, no, no, no. there are no hopes. anya and i are done. i love being single. i'm a strong, successful male who is giddy at the thought of all the women i will no doubt be dating in the near future.
buffy: strong, successful males say "giddy"?
xander: i just worry about her, that's all.
willow: anya?
xander: yeah, she seems so sad.
dawn: she should try acting like everybody else more.
willow: apparently it's what all the kids are doing nowadays.
buffy: well, i'm not sure i get the sad vibe, but there's definitely a vengeance vibe worth worrying about.
xander: oh, that? no, no. i don't worry about that. she was hurt and she just turned back to what she knew when i— you know. but that's not her anymore.
buffy: i hope you're right.
xander: well, she turned that worm guy back before any real damage happened, right? it'll just take some time. i really think she's coming around.

olaf: aud! sweet, beautiful aud! i am so hungry, i could eat a small child!
anya: olaf! are you injured? you smell of blood and musk.
olaf: fear not! it takes more than a band of minor trolls to bring down the mighty olaf!
anya: trolls!
olaf: oh! they are wretched creatures indeed. the mere thought of them makes me bend at the knee and flex!
scene direction: olaf does a muscleman pose
anya: sweetheart, please sit down. allow me to tend to you.
olaf: i am fine. really. i could go for some mead, though.
anya: certainly.
scene direction: olaf looking around the room
olaf: is it my imagination, or do we have substantially more rabbits in this house today?
anya: oh, they breed so quickly that it's—
olaf: all this talk of breeding... it makes me want to breed!
anya: honey, of course. but here—drink your mead first.
olaf: ah, yes. mead.
anya: the rapid reproductive rate of our rabbits...has given me an idea. i can give the excess out to the townspeople, exchanging them not for goods or services, but for goodwill and the sense of accomplishment that stems from selflessly giving of yourself to others.
olaf: ha, ha, ha! sweet aud! your logic is insane and happenstance, like that of a troll. it is no wonder that the bar matrons talk of you.
anya: you've been to the bar...
scene direction: olaf sighs
olaf: it is not my fault they don't take kindly to you. you speak your mind, and are annoying. it's one of the things i love most about you.
anya: was rannveig there?
olaf: bah! i've told you a thousand times; i have no interest in this rannveig. her hips are large and load bearing, like a baltic woman. your hips are narrow, like a baltic woman from a slightly more arid region. you are my perfect aud. i could never want for another.
anya: i am sorry. i simply love you so much...i feel as though i could burst at times...i could not live without you.
olaf: fear not, sweet aud, you will always be my beautiful girl.

spike: i don't trust what i see anymore. i don't know how to explain it, exactly. it's like i've been seeing things.
scene direction: spike pan over to show he's talking to buffy
spike: dru used to see things, you know? she'd always be staring up at the sky watching cherubs burn or the heavens bleed or some nonsense. i used to stare at her and think she'd gone completely sack of hammers. but she'd see the sky when we were inside and it'd make her so happy. she'd see showers. she'd see stars. now i see her.

buffy: spike, it's me. it's you and it's me, and we'll get through this.
spike: never...

buffy: we'll get through this.

scene direction: halfrek anya looks troubled
halfrek: honey, what is it? what's wrong?
anya: it's nothing. i just— there was just so much screaming, so much blood.
scene direction: anya hallie smiles, imagining it
anya: i— i forgotten how much damage a grimslaw demon could do.
halfrek: oh, tell me about it. they can be feisty little guys and impossible to house train. i mean, once they start nesting, forget— are you ok? oh, did something happen?

buffy: thanks for side-kicking. i didn't want to trouble willow. figure she's got enough to do. first day back and all.
xander: are you kidding? we're doing vent work at the site. anything's better than breathing freon for eight hours.
scene direction: xander beat
xander: so, did she say what this thing is?
buffy: some sort of spider demony thingy. she had to go pretty quickly. i think she had to sign up for classes or something.
xander: ah, yes, there is little that can distract the willow when she's on the hunt for the mighty syllabi.
buffy: i don't know. i guess she was a little more nervous than she was letting on.
scene direction: they stumble across a boy's body. the heart has been ripped out. xander starts hyperventilating.
xander: how big did she say this thing was?
buffy: she didn't. but i can't imagine she'd send us out if it wasn't— the heart is completely ripped out. this is our guy.
xander: or a copycat spider demon. so what's this black stuff?
scene direction: there's black stringy things hanging on the nearby tree. xander touches it.
xander: aw, it's sticky!
buffy: willow said it was a spider demon. maybe it's its webbing.
xander: this isn't springy high-flying fun.
scene direction: a noise comes from the tree above them, like something's moving around in it.
scene direction: buffy looking up
buffy: xander.
xander: is that it?
buffy: i can't tell. there is definitely something moving up there.
xander: maybe we can somehow lure it.
scene direction: one of the sticky black webs is shot down from the tree, landing on xander's shoulder. he dives out of the way.
buffy: xander!
scene direction: the spider jumps out of the tree, knocks buffy down to the ground, and lands on top of her. she squirms, but can't get free, as the spider demon's second mouth comes out to try and bite her face. she pushes it off, and it scurries away. she grabs her battle-axe off the ground and looks up in the tree for the spider demon.
buffy: you ok?
xander: buffy, where'd it go? i think we need more swords.
scene direction: buffy still looking up into the tree
buffy: uh-huh.
xander: i say we go home, pick up more swords, and some sort of spidery demon protection amulet. we come back, and—

xander: or—
scene direction: cut to 22 int. buffy's house - day
scene direction: xander and buffy come home covered in huge scrapes and gashes.

willow: i know where it came from.
scene direction: buffy and xander sit down beside each other on the couch, facing willow who's in the chair.

xander: when were you planning on telling us?
willow: i'm telling you now.
xander: great. thank you. willow, it's anya. how could you let us— how could you not have told us?

halfrek: yes, i'm sure this is what she had in mind.
anya: well, i don't know about her mind, but it was in her heart. besides, russia was ready to explode. all we did is just give it a little push.
halfrek: what should we do with the rest of our evening? i hear they're going to raze the winter mansion.
anya: well, i thought we'd head on down to madame dubasov's. no better spot for vengeance than a brothel.
halfrek: oh, it's always work, work, work with you.
scene direction: a man comes into the room on fire, and the girls don't even flinch. they just carry on their conversations without noticing him or helping him.
anya: well, of course. what else is there?
halfrek: what else is there? why, the whole world, for one. darling, take a look around. there's a lot to see. there's a revolution going on outside that you are somewhat responsible for. aren't you the teeniest bit interested?
anya: well, what is there to be interested in? the worker will overthrow absolutism and lead the proletariat to a victorious communist revolution, resulting in socio-economic paradise on earth. it's common sense, really. i have better things to worry about.
halfrek: but, anyanka, there's a whole world out there.
anya: yes, filled with wronged women who need my help.

buffy: she's not the anya that you knew, xander. she's a demon.
xander: that doesn't mean you have to kill her.
buffy: don't act like this is easy for me. you know it's not.
xander: there are other options.
buffy: i've considered them.
xander: when? just now? took you all of ten seconds to decide to kill one of your best friends?
buffy: the thought that it might come to this has occurred to me before. it's occurred to you, too.
xander: but we can change what she did. fix it. these are mystical deaths, right? there has to be something.
willow: i don't have anywhere near that kind of power. i didn't have that kind of power when— and i-i don't think i trust the power i do have.
scene direction: buffy to willow
buffy: it's ok.
scene direction: buffy turns to xander
buffy: xander, i know this is hard for you to hear, but it's what i have to do.
xander: hard for me to hear? buffy, you wanna kill anya!
buffy: i don't want to.
xander: then don't! this isn't new ground for us. when our friends go all crazy and start killing people, we help them.
scene direction: xander looks at willow
willow: sitting right here.
xander: i'm sorry. but it's true.
buffy: it's different.
xander: because you don't care about her the same way i do. buffy, i still love her.
buffy: i know. and that's why you can't see this for what it really is. willow was different. she's a human. anya's a demon.
xander: and you're the slayer. i see now how it's all very simple.
buffy: it is never simple.
scene direction: xander stands
xander: no, of course not. you know, if there's a mass-murdering demon that you're, oh, say, boning, then it's all gray area.
buffy: spike was harmless. he was helping.
xander: he had no choice.
buffy: and anya did! she chose to become a demon. twice.
xander: you have no idea what she's going through.
scene direction: buffy stands
buffy: i don't care what she's going through!
xander: no, of course not. you think we haven't seen all this before? the part where you just cut us all out. just step away from everything human and act like you're the law. if you knew what i felt—
buffy: i killed angel! do you even remember that? i would have given up everything i had to be with— i loved him more than i will ever love anything in this life. and i put a sword through his heart because i had to.
willow: and that all worked out ok.
buffy: do you remember cheering me on? both of you. do you remember giving me willow's message: kick his ass.
willow: i never said that—
xander: this is different—
buffy: it is always different! it's always complicated. and at some point, someone has to draw the line, and that is always going to be me. you get down on me for cutting myself off, but in the end the slayer is always cut off. there's no mystical guidebook. no all-knowing council. human rules don't apply. there's only me. i am the law.
xander: there has to be another way.
buffy: then please find it.
scene direction: xander takes his coat and leaves. buffy goes to the tool chest and grabs a sword. she looks at willow, wanting her to follow, but willow doesn't move.

xander: did everybody have their crazy flakes today? you guys are friends. how could you talk like this?
anya: i have a job to do. and so does buffy. xander, you've always seen what you wanted to. but you knew, sooner or later, it would come to this.
scene direction: xander buffy enters, he turns to face her
xander: buffy, get out of here.
buffy: get out of my way, xander.
xander: no.
scene direction: xander turns back to anya
scene direction: anya in demon face
anya: get out of her way, xander.
scene direction: anya backhands xander and he falls down out of the way. buffy lunges at her with the sword, but anya pushes her off. they continue to fight during the dialogue.
anya: this is getting to be a pattern with you, buffy. are there any friends of your left you haven't tried to kill?
scene direction: anya fighting
anya: c'mon, buffy. don't you have a clever retort for me?
scene direction: anya fighting
scene direction: the fighting is fairly even, or anya may appear to have the slight upper hand. buffy is thrown onto the floor. she looks up at anya.
buffy: anya, i'm sorry.
scene direction: buffy stands
anya: you're apologizing to me. what fight are you watching? or is this like one of your little pop-culture references i don't get, 'cause i'm a vengeance—
scene direction: anya lunges at buffy who presses her against the wall and stabs her in the heart with her sword. anya groans.
scene change: fade to black.

anya: honey? was that weird? that thing earlier with the singing... and the coconuts.
scene direction: xander asleep
xander: what? no, it's fine.

scene direction: neighbor man o.s.:  singing

scene direction: anya looks fondly at xander sleeping
scene direction: anya singing
anya: mr. xander harris.
scene direction: anya walks to him
anya: that's what he is to the world outside. / that's the name he carries with pride.
scene direction: anya puts away his hard hat and tool box
anya: i'm just lately anya. / not very much to the world, i know. / all these years with nothing to show.
scene direction: anya puts away his shoes
anya: i've boned a troll, i've wreaked some wrath, / but on the whole, i've had no path.
scene direction: anya twirling
anya: i like to bowl, i'm good with math, / but who am i?
scene direction: anya kneeling
anya: now i reply that / i'm the missus
scene direction: anya looks at engagement ring
anya: i will be his missus. / mrs. anya christina emanuella jenkins harris.
scene direction: anya twirling, dancing
anya: what's the point of loving... i mean except for the sweaty part.
scene direction: anya gathers pillows
anya: what's the point of losing your heart? / maybe if you're lucky / being a pair makes you twice as tall.
scene direction: anya gathers a blanket
anya: maybe you're not losing at all.
scene direction: anya opens blanket
anya: no need to cover up my heart,
scene direction: anya spreads blanket on xander
anya: so maybe love is pretty smart / and so am i / i found my guy! / and i'll be missus
scene direction: anya sits on his lap while the recliner spins
anya: i will be his missus / mrs. anya lame-ass-made-up-maiden-name harris. / we'll never part
scene direction: anya walks into the kitchen
anya: not if we can / and if we start / then here's my plan / i'll show him what bliss is / welcome him with kisses / 'cause this is a missus who misses her man / he's my xander / and he's awfully swell / it makes financial sense as well, / although he can be—i'll never tell— / just stand aside / here comes the bride

scene direction: cut to 29 int. frat house at u.c. sunnydale - night
scene direction: resume. buffy has just stabbed anya through the heart with her sword. anya, in human face, is slumped, but hasn't fallen. xander regains consciousness and is still on the floor. he looks over and sees anya's condition.
xander: anya!
scene direction: anya face is tear-streaked and bloody. suddenly, she gasps for air and opens her eyes. she looks down at the sword in her chest.
anya: forgotten how much swords through the chest hurt.
scene direction: anya pulls it out
anya: aaahh!
scene direction: anya breathes heavily
anya: you know better than that, buffy. it takes a lot more to kill a vengeance demon.
buffy: oh, i'm just getting started.
scene direction: anya comes at buffy with the sword. buffy pushes a stool at her, knocking her off balance. she falls to the floor, dropping the sword. anya's lying with her back on the floor. buffy takes the sword, straddles anya, and prepares for another thorough double-fisted stabbing of anya. xander pushes buffy out of the way. they all stand up.
anya: stop trying to save me, xander!
scene direction: lightening bolts flash in the room knocking everyone down, then d'hoffryn appears.
d'hoffryn: oh, please, don't mind me. continue with whatever it was you were doing.
scene direction: d'hoffryn walks to look in an adjacent room
d'hoffryn: oh, breathtaking. it's like somebody slaughtered an abercrombie and fitch catalog.
scene direction: d'hoffryn buffy stands and grabs her sword
d'hoffryn: easy now. i'd be gone before you could swing.
scene direction: d'hoffryn sighs, offers a hand to anya to help her stand
d'hoffryn: isn't that just like a slayer. solving all her problems by sticking things with sharp objects. i talked to your friend, miss rosenberg. she's a firebrand. i have high hopes for her.
xander: stay away from willow.
scene direction: d'hoffryn to anya
d'hoffryn: oh, he's gallant, isn't he. i understand what you saw in him.
scene direction: d'hoffryn to all
d'hoffryn: look, miss rosenberg seems to think anyanka would be better suited outside the vengeance fold. i think we already know what lady hacksaway wants. and the young man, he sees with the eyeballs of love. but i'm not sure if anyone's bothered to find out what anyanka herself really wants.
xander: her name is anya.
d'hoffryn: actually, funny historical side-bar, her original name was—
scene direction: anya crying
anya: i wanna take it back.
d'hoffryn: i'm sorry. what was that?
anya: i wanna take it back. i wanna undo what i did.
d'hoffryn: hmm. you want to take it back. must be twelve bodies in there. such a thing—not easily done. but not impossible. you're a big girl, anyanka. you understand how this works. the proverbial scales must balance. in order to restore the lives of the victims, the fates require a sacrifice. the life and soul of a vengeance demon.
anya: do it.
xander: wait!
anya: stay out of this xander.
xander: ok, all right. that seems smart. he just said you have to die! perhaps there's some sort of alternate price.
anya: xander, you can't help me. i'm not even sure there's a me to help.
scene direction: anya to d'hoffryn
anya: i understand the price. do it.
d'hoffryn: you're sure? this is your wish?
anya: this is my wish. undo what i did.
d'hoffryn: very well.
scene direction: d'hoffryn gestures with his hands, and a flash of light appears.
xander: no!
scene direction: where the flash was, halfrek shows up, smiling sweetly.
halfrek: anya!
scene direction: anya looks at d'hoffryn, realizing what's going to happen.
anya: hallie!
scene direction: halfrek bursts into flames and light shoots out of her eyes. she shrieks and disappears. anya starts to cry as d'hoffryn berates her.
d'hoffryn: who did you think you were dealing with? did you think it would be that easy to get away?
anya: why?
d'hoffryn: why? because you wished it!
anya: but she was yours.
d'hoffryn: like you were mine? haven't i taught you anything, anya? never go for the kill when you can go for the pain.
scene direction: d'hoffryn xander starts for d'hoffryn, but buffy stops him
d'hoffryn: hold him back, slayer. wouldn't want anyone to get hurt. i've got plenty of girls. there will always be vengeance demons. but now you, anya, you're out. congratulations. you're wish is granted.
anya: you should've killed me.
d'hoffryn: oh, i wouldn't worry about that. from beneath you, it devours. be patient. all good things in time.
scene direction: in a flash, d'hoffryn disappears. anya looks at xander and buffy and walks out.
scene direction: buffy to xander
buffy: go. i'll check on the boys.
scene direction: cut to 30 ext. frat house at u.c. sunnydale - night
scene direction: xander follows anya outside the fraternity house.
xander: anya, wait.
anya: xander, please. just go away.
xander: whatever's between us—it doesn't matter. you shouldn't be alone in this.
anya: yes, i should. my whole life, i've just clung to whatever came along.
xander: well, speaking as a clingee— i kinda didn't mind.
anya: thanks. for everything.
scene direction: xander nods, realizing that this is her rejecting his offer to help.
anya: xander— what if i'm really nobody?
xander: don't be a dope.
anya: i'm a dope?
xander: sometimes.
anya: that's a start.
scene direction: xander walks away, leaving a teary-eyed anya to deal alone.
scene direction: closing credits.
