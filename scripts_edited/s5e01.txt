scene change: *** act i ***
scene direction: fade in on a beach, daytime. buffy runs into the camera's view and catches a football.
buffy: ha! touchdown! oh yeah. go team me.
scene direction: buffy she does a victory dance
scene direction: shot of riley grinning. buffy throws him the ball; he catches it with a frown.
riley: anybody ever tell team you the quarterback throws like a girl?
scene direction: riley throws the ball back
scene direction: buffy catches the ball, frowning
buffy: i do?
scene direction: riley gives a "well, yeah" shrug.
scene direction: buffy frowns, takes a grip on the ball and throws it. it hits riley in the face and he falls down.
scene direction: buffy concerned
buffy: ooh, sorry!
scene direction: switch to long view. in the foreground we see willow, tara, and anya lounging on beach blankets while xander is sitting by a fire pit, trying to light it. in the background we can see buffy and riley and, beyond them, the ocean. riley is getting up and running at buffy.
buffy: no, don't, no -
scene direction: buffy shrieks as riley tackles her
xander: i'm exhausted just looking at those two. all the splashing and jumping and running... shouldn't relaxing involve less exertion?
anya: absolutely. exertion can lead to sweatiness.
tara: which can cause the pain and heartbreak of stinkiness. better to just stay put.
willow: i think we've just put our finger on why we're the sidekicks.
scene direction: buffy and riley approach.
willow: game over?
riley: uh, buffy slayed the football.
scene direction: riley holds up the deflated ball, then tosses it aside
buffy: where's my burger?
scene direction: buffy xander is still trying to light the fire
riley: yeah, man, i'm starving. cow me.
scene direction: riley he and buffy sit
xander: the, uh, fire's not cooperating. it's comforting to know that i lack the culinary finesse of a caveman.
scene direction: willow gestures at fire
willow: ignis incende.
scene direction: the logs burst into flame. xander falls backward onto his butt in the sand.
buffy: willow, check you out! witch-fu.
scene direction: tara smiles at willow.
willow: it's no big. you just have to balance the elements so when you affect one, you don't wind up causing...
scene direction: a huge clap of thunder interrupts as dark clouds appear out of nowhere and it starts to rain. everyone jumps up shrieking and starts frantically gathering up their stuff.
willow: i didn't do it! i didn't do it!
scene change: they all grab their stuff and run off. cut to exterior shot of a castle, evening, with the storm still raging. a truck drives up. two guys get out and go to the back of the truck, where they remove a tarp from something and begin to pull out a large box.
guy1: come on, hurry it up, i'm getting soaked.
guy2: i'm trying. geez, this thing weighs-
scene direction: they give a pull and the box falls to the ground, cracking open slightly, leaning at an angle with one end on the ground and the other leaning on the truck. a little dirt leaks out of the cracked corner.
scene direction: guy1 annoyed
guy1: nice. good job.
scene direction: guy2 kneels to check out the broken corner
guy2: look at this. guy's carting dirt around.
guy1: leave it. we'll, we'll turn it on its side.
scene direction: they begin trying to right the box.
guy2: dirt. man, rich people are-
scene change: a hand bursts out of the box and slashes his throat. he screams and staggers backward. the other guy watches in horror as a body begins to burst out of the box. cut to exterior shot of giles' building.
scene change: cut to inside giles' apartment. willow is typing on a computer as giles looks on.
willow: there you go. all set.
giles: thank you, willow. obstinate bloody machine simply refused to work for me.
scene direction: giles walks off
willow: just call me the computer whisperer.
scene direction: willow stands up, putting something in the scanner
willow: let's get scannin'. i want to see this puppy go.
scene direction: giles puts a pile of old books on her outstretched arms.
giles: start with those.
scene direction: willow scowls
willow: start? where is finish?
giles: willow, it's essential that we begin archiving the library. i mean, most of these texts have no duplicates.
willow: but ... now? doesn't winter seem more like archiving season?
scene direction: giles looks surprised
giles: well, you don't have to, willow, i mean, you're, you're welcome to leave if, uh...
willow: no. it's fine.
scene direction: willow sits back down
willow: it's just, you've been mr. project all summer. you know? labeling the amulets and indexing your diaries.
scene direction: willow giles gives a little smile
willow: i draw the line at making giant rubber band balls. that's when you'll just have to get a life.
scene direction: willow opens the scanner and takes out whatever is in it
scene direction: giles clears throat
giles: that's what i'm trying to do, actually, is, um, get a life.
scene direction: giles sits down
scene direction: willow not looking at him, doesn't realize he's turned serious
willow: it might go better if you left the house.
giles: willow, um... you mustn't repeat what i'm about to say. especially not to buffy.
scene direction: giles willow looks confused and concerned
willow: uh-oh.
giles: you promise?
willow: oh, god. well, i guess. now that i know there's something to know, i can't *not* know, just because i'm afraid somebody'll know i know, you know?
giles: did that mean yes?
willow: yeah.
giles: we're doing all this because i, i want you and the others to have everything you need at your fingertips. you see, i'm, i'm going back to england.
scene direction: willow looks shocked.
willow: you're ... what? but you can't! you're ... buffy's watcher!
scene direction: giles sighs.
willow: i mean, in a fired way, but...
giles: well, it's become quite obvious that buffy doesn't need me. i-i don't say that in a self-pitying way, i'm, i'm quite proud, actually.
scene direction: giles smiles gently
willow: but what about the rest of us? we still need to be watched! personally, i can't get through a day without a little hairy eyeball.
scene direction: giles laughs softly
giles: i appreciate the sentiment, but it's, it's just not so. you'll be fine. you all will.
scene direction: giles gets up
giles: and you know, we'll, we'll stay in touch. you can always call me whenever you like.
willow: when are you gonna tell buffy?
giles: soon. it won't be easy, but, um... i know she'll understand.
scene change: cut to buffy eating dinner with joyce.
buffy: thanks, mom. everything was yummy.
scene direction: buffy put her napkin on the table
joyce: hey, you up for dessert? we could, uh, take a drive, get some ice cream.
scene direction: buffy stands
buffy: you know, i, i would, but i kinda have to get out on patrol.
scene direction: buffy begins gathering up dishes
joyce: now? it's 8:30.
buffy: well, vamps don't really care what time it is. you know, dark equals dinner bell.
scene direction: buffy begins carrying dishes to kitchen. joyce stays seated
joyce: right, of course.
scene direction: joyce look around empty table
joyce: you know, i'm gonna have to get used to this place without you again. it gets so quiet.
scene direction: buffy comes back in.
buffy: you know, maybe we should make a regular date of this, when school starts.
scene direction: joyce nods
joyce: mm.
buffy: i'm sorry.
scene direction: buffy kisses joyce on cheek
buffy: duty calls. it's a total drag.
scene direction: buffy leaves
scene change: cut to buffy punching a vampire in the cemetery, looking like she's having plenty of fun. she punches him several times and then grabs his shoulders and knees him. he gets up and she's on his back.
scene direction: shot of a bunch of smoke or fog, coalescing into a face. we see just a pair of eyes and a nose.
scene direction: back to buffy on top of the vampire. he throws her down. she gets up and charges, ducks a punch, punches and then kicks him. she tries to kick again but he grabs her and lifts her over his head, then throws her down. she gets up again, jumps on him with her legs around his neck. he throws her down, she flips him over and then stakes him.
scene direction: buffy stands up looking satisfied, begins to stride away purposefully. she walks between the gravestones and suddenly stops, whirls around.
man: very impressive hunt.
scene direction: we see a man walking forward out of the darkness. he's very thin and pale, has long hair, and speaks with an accent.
man: such power.
buffy: that was no hunt. that was just another day on the job.
scene direction: we see that the man is wearing a long flowing cloak and has long flowing hair. he walks toward buffy.
buffy: care to step up for some overtime?
man: we're not going to fight.
buffy: do you *know* what a slayer is?
man: do you?
scene direction: man smirking
scene direction: buffy looks intrigued.
buffy: who are you?
man: i apologize. i assumed you knew. i am dracula.
scene direction: buffy's eyes widen and she looks delighted.
buffy: get out!
scene change: *** act ii ***
scene direction: fade in on willow and xander walking through the darkened graveyard, holding plastic cups of iced coffee.
willow: xand ... what if somebody had a secret, and that somebody promised somebody else that they wouldn't tell anyone.
scene direction: xander nodding
xander: news flash, will. everybody knows.
willow: no, thi-this isn't about me and tara.
xander: oh. well, not that i wouldn't be all ears if you wanted to tell me a secret about you two. even if it was very, very naughty.
scene direction: willow grins
willow: sorry, this is of the non-naughty variety. and i'm not telling you.
scene direction: willow nods firmly
xander: okay. want to see if buffy's hanging around the headstones?
willow: sure. so if i was gonna tell you, which i'm not going to...
scene change: cut to buffy still looking amazed.
buffy: so lemme get this straight. you're ...
scene direction: buffy in dracula's accent
buffy: "dracula." the guy, the count.
dracula: i am.
scene direction: dracula we can see his fangs now.
buffy: and you're sure this isn't just some fanboy thing? cause ... i've fought more than a couple of pimply overweight vamps that called themselves lestat.
scene direction: dracula looks a little annoyed
dracula: you know who i am. as i would now without question that you are buffy summers.
scene direction: dracula walks toward her, looming over her.
buffy: you're heard of me?
dracula: naturally. you're known throughout the world.
scene direction: buffy smiles bashfully
buffy: naw. really?
dracula: why else would i come here? for the sun? i came to meet the renowned ... killer.
buffy: yeah, i prefer the term slayer. you know, killer just sounds so...
dracula: naked?
buffy: like i ... paint clowns or something. i'm the good guy, remember?
dracula: perhaps, but your power is rooted in darkness. you must feel it.
scene direction: buffy frowns and ponders this for a moment.
buffy: no. you know what i feel? bored.
scene direction: she lunges at him with her stake. he dissolves into smoke. as she straightens up looking confused, he reappears behind her. she turns, lunges again. he dissolves into smoke again. buffy looks around.
buffy: okay, that's cheating.
scene direction: xander and willow walk up.
xander: hey buff, what's up?
willow: you look like you just-
buffy: get out of here. now.
xander: fine, but i was gonna give you a sip of my double-mint mocha, but...
scene direction: xander we see dracula reappearing behind him
buffy: behind you.
scene direction: willow and xander turn and see dracula.
willow: hi.
xander: nice. look who's got a bad case of dark prince envy.
scene direction: xander behind him we see buffy holding her stake, looking concerned
dracula: i have no interest in you. leave us.
xander: no, we're not going to
scene direction: xander in dracula's accent
xander: "leave you." and where'd you get that accent, sesame street?
scene direction: xander as the count on sesame street
xander: vun, two, three -- three victims. mwa ha ha!
scene direction: dracula looks annoyed.
scene direction: buffy whispering
buffy: xander, i'm pretty sure that's dracula.
xander: wow, really?
scene direction: xander hurries to stand behind buffy
xander: hey, sorry, man, i was ... just jokin' around.
dracula: this is not the time.
scene direction: dracula locks eyes with buffy
dracula: i will see you soon.
scene direction: he spreads his cape out and moves toward them, turning into a bat and flying over their heads as they all duck and yell. the bat flies away, squeaking. they straighten up and look around. the bat comes back and flies around buffy's head. she covers her head with her hands.
buffy: bat! ooh, bat!
scene change: the bat squeaks and flies away again. cut to exterior shot of giles' building.
xander vo: and then buffy's all, "look out!"
scene change: cut to inside giles' apartment.
xander: and then frigging dracula's standing right behind us.
scene direction: xander sits on sofa where anya and willow are already sitting. we see buffy and riley standing around.
willow: and then, he lunges at us, like whoosh!
scene direction: willow with hand gestures
xander: he totally looked shorter in person.
buffy: i told you he'd heard of me, right? i mean, can you believe that?
scene direction: buffy shot of giles nodding patiently
buffy: count famous heard of me.
riley: i couldn't believe it the first twenty times you told us, but it's starting to sink in now.
buffy: i'm sorry. am i repeat-o-girl? i was just ... blown away.
riley: it's not that surprising that he's heard of you, buffy. you are the slayer.
buffy: i guess. just - the way he said it, you know, i mean, he made it sound so...
willow: sexy? i bet he made it sound sexy.
scene direction: willow grinning. we see tara coming up behind her.
buffy: kinda. he of the dark penetrating eyes and lilty accent.
scene direction: buffy sits
xander vo: i wonder if he knows frankenstein.
scene direction: tara sits on arm of couch and gives willow a glass of soda
tara: you thought dracula was sexy?
willow: oh! no. he, he was ... yuck.
anya: right, except for the whole tall, dark, and handsome thing? yucko.
xander: how would you know?
anya: well, we hung out a few times.
scene direction: anya xander looks jealous
anya: back in my demon days, you know, once or twice. he's pretty cool.
scene direction: anya sighs wistfully, then remembers herself
anya: you know, from, from a whole ... evil thing perspective.
scene direction: xander scoffs
xander: please. he was no big whoop.
willow: no big whoop? what about that thing where he turned himself into a bat? that was awesome!
giles: it must have been, yes.
scene direction: giles everyone looks at him
giles: i must admit, i'm sorry i missed that.
scene direction: willow suddenly realizing
willow: me too! the whole time i was thinking, 'gosh, i wish giles were here, he'd know what to do!'
scene direction: giles smiles tolerantly; he knows what she's trying to do.
scene direction: willow to the others
willow: didn't you guys ... think that?
buffy: actually, i was more thinking, 'bat!'
scene direction: buffy wiggles hands near her head
scene direction: xander to giles
xander: how come he can do that?
giles: i, i have no idea. there's a great deal of myth about dracula. i imagine the trick to defeating him lies in separating the fact from the fiction.
willow: great point! that is so giles, to think of something like that, you know?
scene direction: willow to the others
willow: that, that we ... would have never...
scene direction: willow trails off
buffy: so we should take things slow with dracula. i mean, he said that we would meet again, but i would like to avoid that until we do some serious homework.
riley: i don't know. i mean, he may have a bunch of swell party tricks, but he's still just a vampire. i say we load up with stakes and crossbows and go after him now.
xander: second.
anya: no, buffy's right. dracula's too slick to fall for the usual stuff.
buffy: so we hold off. no killing until we know exactly what we're dealing with.
riley: you're not just saying that because of those dark penetrating eyes of his, are you?
buffy: noooo, his eyes were --
scene direction: buffy gets up and goes over to riley
buffy: there were - there was no penetration.
scene direction: buffy embarrassed
buffy: cross my heart.
giles: all right. willow, you and tara find out everything you can about the actual legend of vlad the impaler on the internet,
scene direction: giles willow and tara nod
giles: and, uh, i'll check the library.
scene direction: giles everyone starts to get up
riley: if the initiative was still around, we'd be able to find everything on this guy in a few hours.
buffy: we might not be as fast, but we'll find him. you guys, we'll reconvene here in the morning.
scene direction: everyone says "uh-huh" and goes off. riley pulls buffy aside.
riley: what's your plan?
buffy: big sleep. my count encounter wiped me out.
scene direction: riley nods
riley: i'm kinda wired. maybe i should just let you get your rest.
buffy: you sure? i mean, maybe if you just lie down with me...
scene direction: buffy suggestive look
scene direction: riley grinning
riley: nothing you are about to say will lead to rest.
buffy: i guess you're right. i'll see you in the morning?
riley: mm-hmm. with donuts.
buffy: mm. heaven.
scene direction: buffy smooch
buffy: see? a little sugar and i'm all yours. dracula schmacula.
scene change: cut to anya and xander walking down the street.
anya: i doubt he'd remember me. i was just a silly young thing. i mean, like seven hundred or so. but he did say that this guy i cursed was doomed forever, which was really sweet, don't you think?
xander: adorable.
anya: it was a great spell. i made this jerk incredibly fat, like a human minivan.
scene direction: the camera pans up to the rooftop of the espresso pump, where we see a wolf growling as it walks along the roof following anya and xander.
anya vo: you should just mention my name if you see him again.
xander: or better yet, why don't you just go sit on top of a crypt and flaunt your neck cleavage until dracula shows up? then you two can talk private.
anya: oh please, don't tell me you're jealous.
xander: oh no, just because you're panting over the guy.
scene direction: xander stops walking
anya: i am not panting. now stop being silly. i'll see you tomorrow.
scene direction: anya smooch
xander: you don't wanna come back to my place?
anya: it's whites day, remember? the bleach smell makes me nauseous.
scene direction: anya walks off
xander: fine. i suppose dracula doesn't use bleach, huh? he's a darks-only man.
scene direction: xander walks off. we see the wolf still watching him.
scene change: cut to xander rounding a corner on the dark street. he jumps in shock when he sees dracula waiting for him.
scene direction: xander sighing
xander: great. perfect.
scene direction: xander suddenly deciding he's not scared
xander: you know what? you're not so big.
scene direction: xander looks dracula up and down
xander: one round of old-fashioned fisticuffs, you'd fold like a bitty baby.
scene direction: dracula scowls.
scene direction: xander rolls up sleeves
xander: okay, let's do it. and no poofing. come on, puffy shirt. pucker on up, 'cause you can kiss your pale ass-
dracula: silence.
xander: yes master.
scene direction: xander shakes head
xander: no, that's not-
scene direction: dracula lifts a hand
dracula: you will be my emissary, my eyes and ears in daylight.
xander: your emissary?
dracula: serve me well. you will be rewarded. i will make you an immortal. a child of darkness that feeds on life itself... on blood.
scene direction: xander in dracula's accent
xander: "blood"?
scene direction: xander speaking very quickly
xander: yes! yes! i will serve you, your excellent spookiness.
scene direction: dracula frowns.
scene direction: xander still speaking too quickly
xander: or master. i'll just stick with master.
dracula: you are strange and off-putting. go now.
scene direction: xander nods, turns to go, turns back.
xander: but master, how can i find-
scene direction: xander sees dracula is gone
xander: brilliant. what an exit! guy's a genius!
scene direction: xander giggles crazily and walks off
scene change: cut to riley opening a crypt door and walking in. candles are lit everywhere. he walks in, looking around.
spike: well, well.
scene direction: spike emerges from the shadows holding a crossbow.
spike: you can take the boy out of the initiative, but you can't take the initiative out of the boy.
riley: i'd put that down, unless you're bucking for one hell of a headache.
scene direction: spike hesitates, puts the bow down.
spike: i can't be too careful. i got quite a few demons after me these days.
riley: i'm looking for some information. might pay a little.
scene direction: spike shrugs
spike: i'll play.
scene direction: spike goes over to a couple of chairs
riley: what can you tell me about dracula?
spike: dracula?
scene direction: spike scoffs
spike: poncy bugger owes me eleven pounds, for one thing.
scene direction: spike puts a cigarette in his mouth
riley: you know him?
spike: know him? we're old rivals.
scene direction: spike lights cigarette
spike: but then he got famous, forgot all about his foes.
scene direction: spike points at riley
spike: i'll tell you what. that glory hound's done more harm to vampires than any slayer. his story gets out, and suddenly everybody knows how to kill us.
scene direction: spike sits down
spike: you know, the mirror bit?
riley: but he's not just a regular vampire. i mean, he has special powers, right?
spike: nothing but showy gypsy stuff. what's it to you, anyway?
riley: he's in town. making his presence known.
scene direction: spike smiling
spike: drac's in sunnydale-way?
scene direction: spike puts feet up on a cassock
spike: i guess the old boy needed closure after all.
riley: actually, he's gunning for buffy. but i'm out to find him before he gets another shot at her.
scene direction: riley sits
spike: tough talk, cowboy. but you're not gonna catch him napping in a crypt. no, the count has to have his luxury estate and his bug-eaters and his special dirt, don't he?
riley: so you're saying i should check out mansions, that sort of thing?
spike: no.
scene direction: spike stands
spike: i'm saying ... you should go home to your superhoney. have a nice, safe snog. you're out of your depth on this one, boy.
scene direction: spike turns his back on riley
riley: you've helped buffy before, so she has a problem with killing you now that you're helpless.
scene direction: riley spike still turned away
riley: i don't.
scene direction: spike turns to face him, walks up to him.
spike: i'd like to see you try.
scene direction: riley stands, gets in spike's face.
riley: would you?
scene direction: they stare each other down. finally, spike looks away.
spike: pfft.
scene direction: riley walks to the door.
scene direction: spike calls out as riley is at the door
spike: you're never gonna find him.
scene direction: riley leaves.
scene direction: spike to himself
spike: not before he gets to her.
scene change: cut to exterior shot of joyce's house, night.
scene change: cut to buffy in bed, asleep.
scene direction: pan over to the window. fog pours in from outside, flows across the floor toward the bed. a breeze comes up, ruffling the sheets. buffy wakes and sits up with a gasp. dracula stands at the foot of the bed.
dracula: you are magnificent.
buffy: i bet you say that before you bite all the girls.
dracula: no, you are different. kindred.
buffy: kindred? hardly, i-
dracula: pull your hair back.
scene direction: buffy looks surprised but pulls her hair back from her neck. shot of dracula admiring her.
buffy vo: this isn't how i ... usually fight.
scene direction: buffy looks a little self-conscious. glances at the window.
buffy: you think you can just waft in here with your music video wind and your hypno-eyes...
scene direction: buffy trails off
dracula: i have searched the world over for you. i have yearned for you.
scene direction: dracula sits on the bed next to her
dracula: for a creature whose darkness rivals my own.
scene direction: he puts his hand on her chin and moves her head aside. he sees the scar where angel bit her (episode "graduation day") and touches it with his fingertips.
dracula: you have been tasted.
scene direction: dracula smiles slightly as he trails his fingers over her cheek
buffy: he was-
dracula: unworthy.
scene direction: dracula buffy stares at him, looks scared
dracula: he let you go.
scene direction: dracula looks her in the eyes
dracula: but the embrace ... his bite ... you remember.
scene direction: buffy uncertain
buffy: no.
scene direction: dracula caresses her face some more.
dracula: do not fight.
scene direction: dracula puts his hand behind her neck
dracula: i can feel your hunger.
scene direction: he leans down to bite her neck. buffy gasps but doesn't pull away.
scene change: *** act iii ***
scene change: fade in on exterior of joyce's house, morning. cut to buffy asleep in bed. she wakes up. sits up looking a little confused.
scene change: cut to buffy dressed, looking in the mirror. she fiddles with her hair, notices something, pulls her hair back to expose two bite marks on her neck. she looks at it for a moment, then grabs a scarf and ties it around her neck.
scene change: cut to riley leaning over with a donut.
riley: here's a jelly one, you want it?
scene direction: closeup of riley's hand holding the donut out.
scene direction: shot of buffy on giles' couch with the donut being held in her face.
buffy: no.
xander: got it! got it. mine, mine.
scene direction: xander note: throughout this scene xander speaks each line very quickly and moves around a lot.
scene direction: xander rushes out of the kitchen and grabs the donut. we see giles in the kitchen. xander walks in little circles, nibbling quickly at the donut. riley looks in the box for another donut. we see willow on a chair in the background.
willow: well, i think we have dracula factoids.
scene direction: xander sitting on a stool eating the donut
xander: like any of that's enough to fight the dark master.
scene direction: everyone gives him a strange look.
xander: ...bator.
willow: a lot of it we already knew.
scene direction: willow riley walks to another chair opposite the couch
willow: turnoffs: wood, fire, crosses, garlic. turn-ons: nice duds, minions,
scene direction: willow wistful
willow: long slow bites that last for days...
riley: yeah, i did a little research too.
scene direction: riley shot of buffy looking distracted
riley: dracula likes to live in style. which means we can rule out the usual dumps vampires haunt.
xander: ah! but he's smart enough to figure that we probably already know that. i'm guessing he's lying low.
scene direction: xander licks his donut. giles comes out from the kitchen
willow: actually, my research backs riley up. drac isn't the lay-low type.
scene direction: giles gives riley a glass of milk
giles: so we can, uh, check out the nicer places. don't you think, buffy?
scene direction: buffy isn't paying attention. we see xander moving from chair to chair and tapping fingers nervously.
giles: buffy?
scene direction: buffy blinks, tunes back in.
buffy: yeah. we'll check all the swanky places first. what else did you guys get?
giles: well, willow has most of it, actually.
scene direction: willow sits up
willow: only because you gave me super pointers! i never would have...
scene direction: giles puts up hand to stop her
giles: just go ahead, willow.
willow: ok. dracula's modus operandi is different from other vampires. he will kill just to feed, but he'd rather have a connection with his victims. and he has all of these mental powers to draw them in.
scene direction: buffy looks thoughtful.
willow: he, he can read and control minds... appear in dreams...
scene direction: buffy distracted
buffy: uh huh.
willow: makes sense. that stare ... he just kinda ... looked right through you. didn't you feel it, buffy?
scene direction: riley looks at buffy.
scene direction: buffy pause
buffy: no.
scene direction: buffy gets up
buffy: no, i didn't.
xander: see! buffy didn't feel it. i think you're drawing a low of crazy conclusions about the unholy prince.
scene direction: everyone gives him a strange look.
xander: ...bator.
giles: the point is, though he goes through the motions of an intimate seduction, the end result is the same. he turns them into a vampire.
scene direction: buffy looks as if she hadn't considered that.
xander: well. that *is* intimate. dracula's gifting these ladies with his own blood. and blood --
scene direction: xander he notices a spider on the desk next to him, glances around to see if anyone's looking
xander: blood is life.
scene direction: everyone looks confused.
xander: according to them.
scene direction: xander slams his hand down on the spider
giles: um ... just be aware that he, he tends to form a relationship with his prey.
scene direction: giles when no one's looking, xander scoops the spider into his mouth and chews
giles: it's not enough for him to take her. she must want to be taken. she must ... burn for him.
scene direction: giles buffy looks uncomfortable, fiddling with her scarf.
buffy: that's ... interesting. i'm gonna go find him.
scene direction: she starts to leave. everyone gets up.
riley: you shouldn't go by yourself, buffy. i mean, this guy's seriously dangerous.
buffy: it's cool, i got it.
scene direction: buffy opens door, leaves.
scene direction: buffy walking through the courtyard outside giles' apartment. riley comes out after her.
riley: hey.
scene direction: riley grabs her arm and stops her
riley: take off that scarf.
buffy: what? no.
scene direction: buffy puts hand over scarf
scene direction: riley gives an "i knew it" nod
riley: you're under the thrall of the dark prince!
scene direction: buffy scoffs
buffy: i am not under the thrall of the dark prince.
riley: then take off the scarf.
buffy: oh, let go of me! this is ridiculous.
scene direction: buffy tries to break arm out of riley's grasp but he holds on
scene direction: riley rips off the scarf as the others come out too. everyone looks at buffy's neck. she sits on the edge of the stone fountain and puts her head in her hands.
giles: why didn't you say anything?
xander: 'cause she didn't want to worry us, right buffster? it's nothin'. just a scratch.
willow: two deep, puncture-y scratches.
scene direction: buffy looks apologetically at riley.
buffy: i'm not sure why i tried to hide it. uh, there was just this voice, and it was, it was telling me to cover it.
riley: and what did i tell you?
scene direction: riley to the others
riley: that's thrall.
xander: you're saying dracula has some sort of freaky mind control over her? you're watching too many creature features, man.
buffy: but it does seem like he has this ... control over me, i ... even though a big part of me is resisting.
scene direction: during this speech we see xander grab a fly off a nearby leaf and eat it.
riley: no, that's okay. i shouldn't take this personally. i mean, what with angel, i mean, it's understandable that there would be transference. i mean, they're both broody immortals.
scene direction: buffy looks dismayed and gets up to walk close to riley.
scene direction: buffy firmly
buffy: i am not transfer-y.
scene direction: buffy quieter
buffy: i swear to you. i'm your girl, and i'm gonna stay that way.
riley: okay. but you are not going anywhere near him again.
giles: uh, riley's right, you should - you should stay out of sight. let the rest of us look for dracula.
buffy: i can't go home. he already got inside once.
xander: you can come over to my place. i'll make sure you stay put.
giles: good. um, riley and i can, uh, can... search for dracula, and willow, you and tara could uh, could do a protection spell on buffy's mother's house, and prevent him from returning.
scene direction: willow nodding
willow: got it. how'd he get inside anyway?
scene change: cut to joyce walking through her house.
joyce: he seemed so nice and normal. a little pale.
scene direction: we see willow and tara working magic on the front door.
willow: a good sunnydale rule of thumb? avoid white-skinned men in capes.
joyce: i'm not like this. i don't invite strange men over for coffee, it's just ... oh, when you girls are older you'll understand.
scene direction: joyce sits on stairs
joyce: it's hard to date. sometimes you just ... feel like giving up on men altogether.
scene direction: willow and tara sneak little looks at each other and try not to grin.
scene change: cut to shot of the sun setting on the horizon.
scene change: cut to giles and riley walking through the grounds of a mansion. riley has a notepad. giles carries a bag.
riley: another bust.
scene direction: riley crosses something off on notepad
giles: and it's getting dark. i should have turned up a better lead. there must be an easier way to find him.
riley: too late to worry about that now. if we hurry, we can hit these last places.
scene direction: they leave the estate.
scene change: cut to xander's basement.
anya: how come i have to be here slayer-sitting while the other guys get to look for dracula?
scene direction: we see buffy and anya sitting on the couch while xander paces.
anya: i mean, just because i'm-
xander: what time is it?
scene direction: anya checks watch
anya: uh, almost six.
scene direction: anya stands up so she's standing in front of the open closet door
anya: look, i mean, i'm the one who knows him, i-i'm the one who had a really good look at him, and so, i mean, what-
scene direction: xander pushes her into the closet and shuts the door.
anya: hey! what?
scene direction: xander puts a chair under the doorknob to hold it shut. we hear anya banging on the door and yelling. buffy sits oblivious through all of this.
scene direction: xander turns to buffy.
scene direction: xander still talking too fast
xander: i'm supposed to deliver you to the master now.
scene direction: buffy looks up at him.
xander: there's this whole deal where i get to be immortal. you cool with that?
buffy: take me to him.
scene change: she stands. we still hear anya pounding and yelling. cut to exterior shot of the castle, night.
scene direction: xander and buffy walking up to the castle, walking up the steps.
scene change: cut to interior of the castle. the typical wooden furnishings. torches and candles everywhere. xander leads buffy in.
xander: master? i deliver the slayer. she who you most desire.
scene direction: xander buffy walks in behind him, still looking kind of catatonic. xander gives a little bow.
xander: sorry, whom.
scene direction: pan across a long table.
scene direction: shot of dracula standing by the fireplace, wearing black pants, red shirt, black vest. he turns slowly.
xander: so now comes the immortality, right? you do the thing, and-
dracula: leave us.
scene direction: xander stops.
dracula: we must not be interrupted.
xander: you bet.
scene direction: xander leaves
scene direction: buffy and dracula stare at each other across the long table.
dracula: i knew you'd come.
buffy: why? because i'm under your thrall?
scene direction: buffy whips out mister pointy and drops the dazed expression
buffy: well, guess again, pal.
dracula: put the stake down.
buffy: okay.
scene direction: buffy puts it down, then looks at her hand in surprise
buffy: right. that ... was not ... you.
scene direction: buffy sounding unconvinced
buffy: i did that. i did that because ... i wanted to.
scene direction: dracula watches her.
buffy: maybe i should rethink that thrall thing.
scene direction: buffy looks around nervously and gives a little whimper
scene change: *** act iv ***
scene direction: exterior of castle. riles and giles walk up.
riley: i've lived in sunnydale a couple of years now. know what i've never noticed before?
giles: uh, a castle?
riley: a big honking castle.
scene direction: they walk toward it.
scene change: cut to riley and giles opening the castle door and entering, looking around. riley points down one hallway. giles nods and goes down it. riley goes the other way.
scene direction: shot of a woman with yellow eyes and vampire teeth peeking out from the shadows, smiling.
scene change: cut to buffy and dracula in the dining room.
buffy: stay away from me.
dracula: are you afraid i will bite you?
scene direction: dracula walking slowly toward her
dracula: slayer, that's why you came.
buffy: no. last night ... it's not gonna happen again.
scene direction: dracula still walking toward her
dracula: stop me. stake me.
scene direction: buffy backing up a little
buffy: i...
scene direction: buffy glancing at stake on the table
buffy: any minute now.
dracula: do you know why you cannot resist?
buffy: 'cause you're famous?
dracula: because you do not want to.
scene direction: buffy shakes head nervously
buffy: my friends-
dracula: they're here.
scene direction: dracula she looks at him
dracula: they will not find us. we are alone.
scene direction: buffy looks anxious.
dracula: always alone.
scene direction: buffy continues to look anxious.
scene direction: dracula begins to circle around her
dracula: there is so much i have to teach you. your history, your power ... what your body is capable of...
scene direction: buffy shaking head
buffy: i don't need to know.
dracula: you long to. and you will have eternity to discover yourself.
scene direction: dracula comes back around in front to face her
dracula: but first ... a little taste.
buffy: i won't let you.
dracula: i didn't mean for me.
scene direction: shot of buffy looking determined.
scene change: cut to riley moving through the dark hallways. he tries a door but it's locked. he turns away, but then the door opens and xander comes out.
xander: nobody harms my master.
riley: your master?
xander: you want him? you come through me.
scene direction: riley punches him in the face. he falls down.
riley: okey-dokey.
scene direction: steps over xander and through the door.
scene change: cut to giles in another part of the castle. he tries a door and it opens. he steps into the darkness beyond and falls off a ledge to the floor about eight feet below.
giles: oh, good show, giles. uhh... at least you didn't get knocked out for a change.
scene direction: giles turns over on his back with a groan
giles: oh ... oh, ladies.
scene direction: three vampire women appear and begin crawling over him.
giles: you would ... be the three sisters, yes?
scene direction: they begin kissing his cheek and rubbing his chest.
giles: e-excellent, right. uh, i'd heard that you were myth ... obviously erroneous.
scene direction: one of them rips his shirt open and begins caressing him.
giles: aah! ooh, that's, uh, that, uh...
scene direction: giles giggling
giles: tickles! ooh, uh... oh, dear god.
scene direction: giles panting
scene direction: cut back to dracula. he holds up his arm and rolls up the sleeve.
buffy: what are you-
dracula: all those years fighting us. your power so near to our own...
scene direction: dracula cuts his arm with a fingernail till blood wells up
dracula: ...and you've never once wanted to know what it is that we fight for?
scene direction: dracula holds his arm out to buffy
dracula: never even a taste?
scene direction: buffy looks conflicted
buffy: if i drink that-
dracula: i have not drunk enough for you to change. you must be near death to become one of us. and that comes only when you plead for it.
scene direction: buffy staring at his wrist
buffy: i'm not hungry.
dracula: no. your craving goes deeper than that.
scene direction: buffy stares at him.
scene direction: dracula whispering
dracula: you think you know ... what you are ... what's to come. you haven't even begun.
scene direction: buffy looks at his arm, at his face. takes his hand in both of hers and puts her mouth on the bloody wrist.
dracula: find it. the darkness. find your true nature.
scene direction: buffy's eyes are wide.
scene direction: a very quick series of shots flashing by. most are shots of buffy fighting, but a few are shots of the first slayer from episode "restless." there's also a shot of a vein with blood corpuscles rushing through it.
scene direction: buffy lifts her head.
scene direction: buffy softly
buffy: wow.
scene direction: she suddenly shoves out her hand and pushes dracula away. he lands on the table and slides across it on his back.
scene direction: buffy normal voice
buffy: that was gross.
scene direction: she walks forward as dracula gets to his feet.
dracula: you are resisting.
buffy: looks like.
dracula: come here. come to me.
scene direction: dracula holds out hand
buffy: you know, i really think the thrall has gone out of our relationship. but i want to thank you for opening up my eyes a little.
dracula: what is this?
buffy: my true nature. you want a taste?
scene direction: dracula growls and lunges at her. she jumps over his head, whirls, kicks him, punches him twice, kicks him into a wall. he spins back, grabs her arm, punches her and flings her across the room. she lands on the table on her back.
scene change: cut to riley walking up to an open door.
riley: buffy? are you in-
scene direction: riley stops himself before falling into the pit
riley: giles! giles!
scene direction: riley pulls out a cross and holds it up. the three female vampires hiss and slink away. riley tosses the cross to giles, who catches it.
riley: come on, come on. grab my hand.
giles: thank god you came.
riley: come on!
giles: there was no possible escape.
scene direction: still staring back toward the sisters, giles takes riley's hand and riley pulls him up. giles notices his foot has only a sock on it.
giles: oh, my shoe.
scene direction: giles pointing back into the pit
giles: silly me, i'll just pop-
riley: no no no, sir!
scene direction: riley pulls him away
riley: no more chick pit for you. come on.
scene direction: riley they get up and move off down the hall.
scene direction: cut back to buffy running across the room. she barrels into dracula and they fall to the floor, rolling. he's on top. he punches her, she punches him, then she grabs his shirt and flips him over. now she's on top. she punches him a few times. then he catches her fist and flings her off him. he's grinning. they both get up, grab each other and fall down again. buffy's on top. she brings both her hands down but he blocks and flings her away again. she flies backward and hits the wall. she grabs him, he flips her across the table and then jumps onto it. she hits him with a chair and then sweeps his feet out from under him. he punches her. she grabs a torch and he rolls away just as she hits the table with it. they face each other across the table.
buffy: a guy like you should think about going electric. seriously.
scene direction: dracula growls and turns to smoke. buffy looks around, sees where the smoke is converging, drops the torch and runs toward the smoke. she grabs mister pointy off the table as she runs, leaps to the top of the stairs, and is there to stake dracula just as he appears from the smoke. he looks shocked.
buffy: how do you like my darkness now?
scene direction: dracula growls, falls down the stairs and explodes into dust.
scene direction: buffy saunters down the stairs.
scene direction: riley and giles rush in.
riley: buffy! you okay?
buffy: yeah. chock-full of free will.
giles: and dracula?
buffy: eurotrash.
scene direction: xander rushes in holding a torch.
scene direction: xander back to talking normally
xander: where is he? where's the creep that turned me into his spider-eating man-bitch?
buffy: he's gone.
xander: dammit! you know what? i'm sick of this crap. i'm sick of being the guy who eats insects and gets the funny syphilis. as of this moment, it's over. i'm finished being everybody's butt-monkey!
scene direction: giles, riley, and buffy nod and try to look solemn.
buffy: check. no more butt-monkey.
riley: it coulda been worse. at least you weren't making time with the dracu-babes like giles here.
giles: i was not making time! i, i was, uh, just about to kill those, uh, loathsome creatures when riley interrupted me.
scene direction: giles wrapping his torn shirt around himself
scene direction: riley (grinning) you were gonna nuzzle 'em to death?
scene direction: riley and buffy grin and start to walk away.
giles: of course not! i was in complete...

scene direction: he walks out.
scene direction: shot of the candles burning in the chandelier.
scene direction: shot of the stairs.
scene direction: shot of the bottom of the stairs. the fog appears and begins to converge.

buffy: you think i don't watch your movies?
scene direction: buffy rolling her eyes
buffy: you always come back.
scene direction: dracula explodes into dust again. buffy folds her arms and watches.

giles: well, actually, i have something to tell you.
scene direction: giles comes over with a teapot. they both sit on the sofa.
buffy: actually, i have something that i'd like to talk to you about, too.
giles: oh, well, you go first, by all means.
buffy: no, go ahead.
giles: no, i insist.
scene direction: giles pouring tea
scene direction: buffy after a moment, softly
buffy: you haven't been my watcher for a while.
scene direction: buffy giles stops pouring
buffy: i haven't been training ... and i haven't really needed to come to you for help.
scene direction: giles sadly
giles: i agree.
scene direction: giles sets down the teapot
scene direction: buffy gestures helplessly, gets up to pace
buffy: and then this whole thing with dracula ... it made me face up to some stuff.
scene direction: buffy giles looks concerned
buffy: ever since we did that spell where we called on the first slayer ... i've been going out a lot.
scene direction: buffy giles looks surprised
buffy: every night.
giles: patrolling?
buffy: hunting. that's ... what dracula called it.
scene direction: buffy pacing
buffy: and he was right. he understood my power better than i do. he saw darkness in it.
scene direction: shot of giles looking very concerned.
scene direction: buffy sits down again
buffy: i need to know more. about where i come from, about the other slayers. i mean, maybe ... maybe if i could learn to control this thing, i could be stronger, i could be better. but ... i'm scared. i know it's gonna be hard. and i can't do it ... without you. i need your help.
scene direction: buffy pause
buffy: i need you to be my watcher again.
scene direction: giles stops frowning.
scene direction: buffy sighs, laughs nervously
buffy: boy, i just, i just keep talking, don't i? i'm sorry, you-you had something you wanted to say?
scene direction: giles smiling
