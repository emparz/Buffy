scene direction: willow looking back toward the man
willow: he—he doesn't seem like much of a threat.
scene direction: officer squinting at willow

scene direction: giles pulls willow away
officer: right. ok.

buffy: and that you should expect to see some bruising when you remove the bandages. bruising around the— area. the, uh, bone structure and musculature was hit pretty hard.
xander: ok.: buffy: um, also they said that the—the meds may cause you some stomach discomfort, so we're gonna have to be careful with your diet.
xander: i can't taste anything right now anyway. i keep waiting for my other senses to improve 50%. yeah, they should kick in any day now.
scene direction: buffy smiling
buffy: well, we're looking at a possible release as early as tonight. um, we're just waiting for your labs to get back, and dr. kallet said that should be a couple of hours.

scene direction: buffy willow looks heartbroken
buffy: i want to get everyone started on this. i think we're really close to something.
xander: it's ok. it's gotta be done. and i might see you tonight, without depth perception, of course, but... still.
scene direction: xander smiles
scene direction: willow holding xander's hand
willow: so, i guess you're stuck with me then, huh?
scene direction: willow tries to sound chipper
willow: let's order some cherry-flavored off-brand gelatin, and then i think we'll be up for a rousing game of—
xander: i might need a parrot.
willow: huh?
xander: well, to go with the eye patch, to really complete the look. i think i still have that costume from halloween.
willow: yeah, and don't underestimate the impact of a peg leg. maybe the hospital can hook you up with a nice one. maybe they have a 2-body-parts for the price of one kind of deal.
xander: oh, you know what the best part is? no one will ever make me watch jaws 3-d again.
willow: yeah, and,

scene direction: xander sighs, looks at willow as tears well up in her eyes
xander: oh, willow... please don't.

scene direction: cut to 10 int. basement at buffy's house - day
scene direction: anya is standing in front of the group of potentials lecturing while andrew stands to her side, writing key words on an easel-pad. andrew writes "ubervamp."
anya: and so we know that a battle is coming. ubervamps galore. we also know that the ubervamps are hard to kill...
scene direction: andrew writing in red
andrew: hard...to...kill.
anya: but i have been out talking to some of my old contacts, and they've provided some surprising bits of news. yay for them!
scene direction: anya andrew draws a picture of an ubervamp
anya: uh...ok. for example, ubervamps can be staked... right through the heart. zing—poof.
scene direction: anya andrew writes "steak" then crosses it out and writes "stake" beside it
anya: just like regular vamps. um...we didn't know this.
scene direction: anya andrew draws a red arrow from the word "stake" to the torso of his ubervamp drawing
anya: of course, these guys have incredibly strong sternums, so it's a lot like driving a wooden stake through solid steel. but you guys are all super-strong, right?
scene direction: kennedy scoffs
kennedy: um...no.
anya: right. ok. um... but still, heart information, still good to know since holy water seems to run off these guys like they've been scotch-guarded. and, well, sunlight would work, but guess what— they're not coming out during the daytime.
scene direction: anya andrew flips to a clean sheet of paper and draws a yellow smiling sun
anya: uh, also, beware of their, uh, teeth and the claws they use to shred flesh.
scene direction: anya anya holds up her hand, fingers spread, like she's clawing and shredding with her hand; andrew writes "teeth, claws"
rona: ok, you know what? i used to be really afraid of these ubervamp guys. but then the scary preacher blew into town, and now i'm mostly terrified of him.
scene direction: anya flips her note cards
anya: right, well, um... we're working on getting info on that guy.
amanda: why bother? nothing works. nothing will.
scene direction: anya shuffling her note cards
anya: ok... i know you're all upset... and i, myself, would much rather be sitting at the bedside of my one-eyed ex-fiance than killing time here with you people in this over-crowded and might i add increasingly ripe-smelling basement. and i would be, too, if not for a certain awkward discussion he and i recently had right over there on that cot immediately following some exciting and unexpected breakup sex.
scene direction: anya some of the girls seem grossed out and move off the cot; andrew writes "breakup sex" on the paper, underlining it
anya: but...i need to give him some space... so i'm doing what i can do, contributing any way i can... and so will all of you. you still need to know this information. we can't stop just because something else is trying to kill you, too.

scene direction: faith's sitting alone on the countertop in buffy's kitchen eating potato chips from a bag when kennedy walks upstairs.

scene direction: faith kennedy looks confused
faith: sorry. habit.
scene direction: faith faith hands kennedy the bag

scene direction: kennedy takes some chips
kennedy: probably.
scene direction: kennedy hands the bag back to faith

scene direction: amanda walks upstairs from the basement into the kitchen
amanda: do you think there are gonna be questions about her sex life on the test? 'cause i really hope i don't have to study all that.
faith: yeah.
scene direction: faith grins
faith: whenever she starts talking about getting all sweaty with xander like that i just remind her i had him first. shuts her right the hell up.
kennedy: thing is— what's the point? studying demon hot zones and pressure points doesn't do a hell of a lot of good when preacher man's out there, ready to finish the job he started.
faith: no one's come up with any info on caleb yet?
amanda: no. nothing is working—not research, not anya's contacts.
kennedy: we're lousy with dead ends around here.

scene direction: buffy smiles, puts down the file on the table, starts opening it
faith: whatcha got?
buffy: info that giles and willow were able to pull off the police database. we figured with caleb's, you know, overt religiosity thing if we wanna learn more about him, let's find out where he's been.
scene direction: faith reading from the file
faith: "incidents of violence and vandalism connected to california religious institutions in the last 10 years." looks like this gives us a place to start.
buffy: yeah. i figure we start with california. we don't find anything there, we'll expand the search. but a guy like caleb didn't just get in the game. he's been playing for a while, and i wanna know where. whatever it takes.
scene direction: buffy to dawn
buffy: you good to help?
dawn: well, i was gonna do lots and lots of homework, but darn the luck, they went and canceled school,
scene direction: dawn buffy hands dawn papers
dawn: so looks like i got the time.
buffy: good.
scene direction: dawn sits
dawn: hey, buffy... how was xander's mood, you know, exactly?
scene direction: dawn buffy doesn't look at her
dawn: and did you get a chance to talk to the doctor about the meds? because it seemed like—
faith: hey, pipsqueak, why don't you go get some of the stuff you've already gotten from giles?
dawn: or, um, we can talk about this later, maybe.
scene direction: buffy still hasn't looked at dawn
buffy: ok.
dawn: yeah. i'll be right back.
scene direction: dawn leaves the room
buffy: try to find anything that looks like caleb, his church, his ring...
kennedy: his ability to render a slayer useless in just one punch.
scene direction: kennedy buffy looks up, hurt; faith frowns
kennedy: i didn't— that was stupid. i don't know why i said that.
scene direction: buffy stifling tears, stands
buffy: uh, it's ok. um...you know, i—i have to go to the school to pick up the rest of my stuff.
scene direction: kennedy stands
kennedy: i really didn't mean—
buffy: it's fine. really, it's fine. don't worry about it. hey, uh... isn't anya doing that thing for you guys today?
kennedy: yeah. we were. we probably should head down there now.
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: ok. i'll be back soon.
scene direction: buffy kennedy and amanda leave; to faith

caleb: he abandons you.
scene direction: caleb buffy reaches for a drawer in the cabinet
caleb: not that he could do you much good now, anyway—
scene direction: caleb caleb turns to see buffy trying to reach into the cabinet for something
caleb: ah, ah, ah.
scene direction: caleb condescending
caleb: wouldn't do that were i you, swee'pea. fightin' back didn't do you much good last time, did it? and how is poor, sweet xander? let him know he's in my prayers, and any time he's willin', i'm ready to...
scene direction: caleb makes a poking gesture
caleb: finish the job.
buffy: go near xander again, and i will end you.
scene direction: caleb pushes over buffy's desk violently, walks purposefully toward buffy
caleb: mind your manners. i do believe i did warn you once. you're angry... frustrated, scared. i like that in a girl. you really should relax a little. look at where you are. history's gonna look back at you, at me, at this place, and they're gonna see the glory. great things are happenin' now, right here. this school, the seal... it's all gonna be a part of the great sweepin' tide of change, and you're gonna be a part of it. now, why would you wanna miss that? more importantly, why would you want to get in its way?

giles: shut up. pay attention.
scene direction: giles holds the magnifying glass over the photo
giles: dawn, what do you see?

amanda: no!
scene direction: officer looks at amanda
officer: what?
scene direction: kennedy takes the gun away from the officer and hits him in the face with the butt of the gun before pointing it at him. the officer knocks the gun out of kennedy's hands, but can't grab it before amanda knocks him in the head with a broom handle. on the floor, the officer tries to crawl away, but rona and chao-ahn kick him and then dawn jumps on his back, kicking and screaming at him. finally, the girls rush out the back door.
scene direction: cut to 28 ext. bronze night club - night
scene direction: the girls rush outside to find faith lying on her back on the ground, shielding herself with her arms over her face as the police have ganged up on her, beating her with billy clubs. kennedy and amanda go up to the police men and throw them off of faith. faith has a chance to get to her feet now and joins in the fight against the police. she kicks a man against the hood of his car, and grabs the club from another, presses it against his throat, and knocks him into a wall. he sinks down to the ground.
scene direction: buffy walks up as the fight ends
buffy: faith! what are you doing?
faith: just blowing off steam. well, it started that way. turned when the cops went evil on us.
scene direction: dawn, chao-ahn, rona and the other girls come out of the club and gather around buffy and faith.
buffy: girls, go home.
scene direction: buffy glares at faith
buffy: i need to talk to faith for a minute.
dawn: buffy, we weren't—
buffy: dawn— you, too. go.
scene direction: buffy the girls walk away; to faith
buffy: what is this?
faith: they needed a break, all right? they've been running themselves into the ground. things just got out of hand.
buffy: taking a break is one thing—i get blowing off steam—but they were fighting. and those girls were drunk! what were you thinking?!
faith: seemed like a good idea at the time.
buffy: yeah, what if someone had gotten hurt?
faith: they didn't.
buffy: faith, i need to know that these girls are gonna be safe when i'm not around.
faith: no one got hurt, b. look, you don't even know these girls. maybe you should have a little more confidence in 'em, let them mess up sometimes, you know, get down and dirty. how the hell else are they gonna learn?
buffy: learning from your mistakes is one thing. but you don't throw children into—
faith: they're not children.
buffy: that really isn't the point.
scene direction: buffy walks off
faith: yeah, what about the vineyard?
scene direction: buffy stops walking
buffy: what?
faith: how safe were they when you dragged them off to meet caleb? how safe was rona or amanda or molly?
scene direction: enraged, buffy punches faith in the face, knocking her down to the ground. buffy walks away. faith touches her face and watches buffy go, but doesn't follow.

andrew: you sure you don't wanna stop and pick up some burgers or something, you know, road trip food?
spike: it's not a road trip. it's a covert operation.
andrew: right. right. gotcha.
scene direction: andrew beat
andrew: i—i bet even covert operatives eat curly fries. they're really good.
scene direction: spike rolls eyes, then
spike: not as good as those onion blossom things.
andrew: ooh, i love those.
spike: yeah, me, too.
andrew: it's an onion... and it's a flower. i—i don't understand how such a thing is possible.
spike: see, the genius of it is you soak it in ice water for an hour so it holds its shape. then you deep-fry it root-side up for about 5 minutes.
andrew: masterful.
spike: yeah.
scene direction: spike beat
spike: tell anyone we had this conversation, i'll bite you.
andrew: right.
scene direction: cut to 30 ext. front porch at buffy's house - night
scene direction: faith is sitting on the front porch railing smoking a cigarette alone as robin wood walks up to the house.
robin wood: the big meeting hasn't started yet, has it?
faith: god, i hope so.
robin wood: faith?
faith: you must be principal wood. heard a lot about you.
scene direction: faith takes a drag
robin wood: it hasn't really started yet, has it? 'cause i, uh... i hate being late.
faith: troops are still gathering. i think you're safe.
scene direction: faith nods
robin wood: looks like someone banged you up pretty well.
faith: yeah. cops. mostly.
robin wood: mostly?
faith: yeah.
scene direction: faith points to her cheek
faith: this one's from someone who just thinks she's a cop. it's my favorite of all my current bruises.
robin wood: so someone who thinks she's a cop, huh?
scene direction: robin wood sits
robin wood: you gonna have to, like...ice her now or something like that?
scene direction: faith grins
faith: i'm not gonna kill her. wanted to, but didn't. by the way, bully for me since no one else said it.
robin wood: for what? for not killing buffy?
faith: it's this new thing i'm tryin'.
scene direction: robin wood grins
robin wood: she told me about you.
faith: believe every word.
robin wood: so what changed? i mean... why didn't you fight back?
scene direction: faith shrugs
faith: other things matter more.
robin wood: i think you're worried about her.
scene direction: faith shakes her head
faith: i think you need to brush up on your buffy and faith history.
scene direction: robin wood chuckles
robin wood: all right, if you say so. but i read people pretty well. it's a thing i do.
scene direction: faith stands
faith: you, uh, live around here, right?
robin wood: uh, no, not exact— well, it's the center of town, really.
faith: this town, walking anywhere after dark is like an extreme sport. someone who didn't know you very well might think you were out lookin' for a fight or something.
scene direction: faith mock-punches him
faith: maybe you got bigger issues than what's wrong with b. i read people, too.
scene direction: faith a car pulls into the driveway
faith: xander's home.
scene direction: cut to 31 int. mission - night
scene direction: spike pushes open the creaky front door to the mission as andrew stands nervously behind him. spike sighs and walks in, followed by andrew.
andrew: no one's here. these kinda places make me feel funny inside.
spike: i'll buy that. you and me got something else in common after all.
scene direction: someone jumps out of a closet as they walk past, grabbing andrew and pushing him against the wall.
andrew: spike!
scene direction: spike pulls the robed man off of andrew, and the man punches spike. they start to fight. spike pushes the man against the wall, and he falls to the ground. spike pushes the hood off of the man's face to reveal a burn mark on the man's cheek. the mark looks like something caleb made with his ring.
scene direction: cut to 32 int. living room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: there's a hastily made yellow banner painted with "welcome home" in big red letters hanging over the fireplace. giles, dawn and the potentials are gathered in the living room as buffy and willow escort xander in the room. faith and robin wood follow, closing the door behind them.
scene direction: xander looking around
xander: oh, god.
kennedy: we didn't have time to do more. you have to pretend there's a big party here.
scene direction: dawn goes up to xander and gives him a big, long, tight hug.
xander: that's fine. parties in this house, i usually end up having to... rebuild something.
buffy: welcome home, xander. i wanted you to be here for this. i think you'll be interested in what i found out.
willow: w-what did you find out?
buffy: i-it's about the cellar. look, i know that night wasn't fun for any of us... but i figured out some things about that place, and i realize now what we have to do.
scene direction: buffy giles looks at her, concerned
buffy: we're going back in.
scene change: fade to black.
scene change: *** act iv ***
scene direction: cut to 33 int. mission - night
scene direction: spike and andrew recognize the shape of the robed man's scar and stare at him. spike bends down to get a better look.
spike: tell me about the mark.
monk: oh...
scene direction: monk covers the scar with his hand
spike: hey! are you part of caleb's faction?
scene direction: monk shakes his head
monk: no! no!
spike: then tell me what happened.
scene direction: monk weakly, frightened
monk: i c-can't.
scene direction: andrew bends down to get in his face
andrew: "can't" is a 4-letter word! i'm andrew. i'll be your bad cop this evening. you don't start singing, my associate here—
spike: we're trying to fight him. caleb. we need your help.
scene direction: spike andrew stands
monk: you can't fight him. you can't stop him. you can only run.
scene direction: andrew bends down to get in his face
andrew: "run" is a 4-letter wor—
scene direction: andrew catches himself 
andrew: a 3-letter word.
scene direction: andrew stands
scene direction: spike stands
spike: talk.
monk: i'll do better. i'll show you.
scene direction: monk spike offers the man his hand, helping him to his feet
monk: one night,
scene direction: monk grabs a candelabra
monk: some time ago, a man arrived at our doors.
spike: and you said, "come in, do some damage"?
monk: we are—we are a benevolent order, and, yes, we welcomed him. we offered to feed him... but he had come for something else.
scene direction: the monk walks up to a statue of mary in an alcove, just as seen on the picture that led spike here in the first place. he touches a secret lever, causing the statue to swing out of the way, revealing a secret compartment behind it.
monk: behind this, he revealed something even we didn't know was here. a secret room.
scene direction: monk walks in; spike and andrew follow
monk: he was excited, talking the whole time... destiny, that sort of thing.
spike: yeah. we hear he's a real smooth talker.
scene direction: monk takes a tapestry off the wall, revealing an inscription behind it
monk: he was going on about this ancient inscription.
andrew: neat.
monk: he read it... and he didn't like what it said. his temper... he was the purest evil i've ever seen. he burned his mark upon me. and then i ran and i hid... and i listened to the others die.
andrew: running away...saved your life.
scene direction: andrew spike takes the candelabra from the monk and walks up to the inscription
andrew: what does it say?
scene direction: the inscription is latin words written with greek letters - non tibi est. ei solae tractare licet.
scene direction: spike translating
spike: "it is not for thee. it is for her alone to wield."
scene direction: cut to 34 int. living room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: buffy addresses the meeting of giles, dawn, faith, willow, xander, robin wood and all the potentials in her living room. xander is sitting in an overstuffed chair, with dawn sitting beside him on the arm of the chair. kennedy is sitting on the sofa, with willow sitting beside her on the arm of the sofa. anya is standing beside willow with her arms crossed.
buffy: look, i know what you're thinking, but i had a visit at the school today from caleb.
dawn: buffy, why didn't you—
buffy: i'm fine. i mean, it wasn't fun, but i'm fine. i'm better than fine. i—i figured something out. he kept making all this noise about the school.
robin wood: is it that seal again?
willow: do we need to try shutting it again?
buffy: no, that's just it. we've spent all this time worrying about the seal and the hellmouth. why isn't caleb guarding them? why doesn't he have someone there protecting it? why is he camped out at the vineyard? the bad guys always go where the power is. so if the seal was so important to caleb and the first, they would be there right now. they're protecting the vineyard or something at the vineyard. i say it's their power, and i say it's time we go in and take it away from them.
scene direction: xander shakes his head and looks down. giles uncrosses his arms and sighs.
scene direction: faith standing beside robin wood with her arms crossed
faith: or, in the alternative, how 'bout...we don't? i mean, it's a neat theory, b, but i'm not going back in that place, not without proof, and neither should you and neither should they.
buffy: i'm not saying it's gonna be easy.
robin wood: i think faith had the floor.
faith: maybe it ends ok the way you wanna play it, but maybe it doesn't. and right now, i don't think i want you playin' the odds.
buffy: did you come here to fight?
faith: listen, we're fighters, all of us, but you gotta give me something to fight, something real, not—
scene direction: giles softly
giles: windmills.
scene direction: giles looks at buffy
buffy: there is something there.
giles: maybe. but we can't be sure of that. this is a hell of a lot to ask.
robin wood: too much.
scene direction: buffy grinning nervously, looks around
buffy: i—i don't understand this. for 7 years, i've kept us safe by doing this— exactly this, making the hard decisions. and now, what— suddenly you're all acting like you can't trust me?
giles: didn't you say to me today you can't trust us? maybe there's something there that should be addressed.
buffy: is that why you sent spike away, to ambush me?
scene direction: giles rolls his eyes, sighs
giles: oh, come on.
rona: you know what? i am sick of your deal with this spike guy. this isn't about him. this is about you. you're being reckless.
scene direction: buffy steps back
buffy: what?
rona: you are! i don't even know you, and i can tell! you are so obsessed with beating caleb, you are willing to jump into any plan without thinking.
scene direction: buffy through gritted teeth
buffy: that's not what i'm doing.
scene direction: kennedy stands, walks up to buffy
kennedy: well, that's how it feels to us. people are dying.
scene direction: willow stands, walks up to kennedy
willow: kennedy...
scene direction: kennedy turns and snaps at willow
kennedy: why are you always standing up for her?
scene direction: willow softly, sadly
willow: i'm not.
buffy: what do you mean, you're not?
willow: with everything that's happened, i—
scene direction: willow shrugs
willow: i'm worried about your judgment.
scene direction: buffy looks around
buffy: look, i wish this could be a democracy. i really do. democracies don't win battles.
scene direction: buffy xander looks away
buffy: it's a hard truth, but there has to be a single voice. you need someone to issue orders and be reckless sometimes and not take your feelings into account. you need someone to lead you.
scene direction: anya calmly
anya: and it's automatically you.
scene direction: anya looks at buffy
anya: you really do think you're better than we are.
buffy: no, i—
anya: but we don't know. we don't know if you're actually better. i mean, you came into the world with certain advantages, sure. i mean, that's the legacy.
buffy: i—: anya: but you didn't earn it. you didn't work for it. you've never had anybody come up to you and say you deserve these things more than anyone else. they were just handed to you. so that doesn't make you better than us. it makes you luckier than us.
buffy: i've gotten us this far.
xander: but not without a price.
buffy: xander—
xander: i'm trying to see your point here, buff... but i guess it must be a little bit to my left...
scene direction: xander shakes his head
xander: 'cause i just don't.
buffy: look, i'm willing to talk strategy, ok, i'll hear suggestions on how to break this down, but this is the plan. we have to be together on this or we will fail again.
giles: we are clearly demonstrating that we are not together on this!
scene direction: buffy commandingly
buffy: which is why you have to fall in line! i'm still in charge here.
rona: why is that, exactly?
buffy: because i'm the slayer.
rona: and isn't faith a slayer, too?
scene direction: faith caught off guard
faith: what? whoa, whoa, whoa. so not what i meant. i'm not in charge chick. i think b here needs to just...chill out for a little bit, take a siesta or something. but i'm not the one you want.
kennedy: maybe we need a vote... to see who wants faith to have a turn in charge.
scene direction: buffy sternly
buffy: no.
kennedy: no, what?
buffy: no. you don't get to vote until i've had my chance to pal around, you know, get everybody drunk. see, i didn't get this was a popularity contest. i should have equal time to bake them cookies, braid their hair—
faith: learn their names?
scene direction: buffy laughs
buffy: you're just lovin' this, aren't you?
faith: you have no idea what i'm feeling.
scene direction: buffy low, mean
buffy: come in here, take everything that i have... you did it before. did you tell them that? did you tell them how you used to kill people for fun? hey, you guys think that's nifty?
giles: buffy, that's enough!
faith: i didn't come here to take anything away from you, but i'm not gonna be your little lapdog, either. i came here to beat the other guy, to do right, however it works. i don't know if i can lead. but the real question is...can you follow?
robin wood: so we vote.
buffy: wait. guys—
scene direction: buffy looks around—anya's crossed her arms and stares back with pursed lips; willow looks away—buffy searches their faces.
buffy: i can't watch you just throw away everything that—
scene direction: buffy looks at xander and at dawn, who's not meeting her glance; buffy holds her head up high
buffy: i know i'm right about this. i just need a little— i can't stay here and watch her lead you into some disaster.
scene direction: dawn stands, walks up to buffy, softly
dawn: then you can't stay here. buffy, i love you, but you were right. we have to be together on this. you can't be a part of it.
scene direction: dawn buffy blinks her eyes in disbelief
dawn: so i need you to leave. i'm sorry, but this is my house, too.
scene direction: buffy looks around then walks out the front door.
rona: ding dong, the witch is dead.
scene direction: dawn low, angrily
dawn: shut your mouth.
scene direction: cut to 35 ext. front porch at buffy's house - night
scene direction: faith follows buffy outside.
scene direction: faith concerned
faith: hey. look, i swear i didn't want it to go this way—
scene direction: buffy sternly
buffy: don't.
faith: i mean it, i—
buffy: don't...be afraid to lead them.
scene direction: buffy buffy's face is wet with tears
buffy: whether you wanted it or not, their lives are yours. it's only gonna get harder. protect them,
scene direction: buffy looks at faith
buffy: but lead them.
scene direction: faith walks back inside the house. her face tear-streaked, buffy walks down the front walk alone.
scene direction: closing credits.
