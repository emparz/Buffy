scene direction: episode opens on buffy walking into a darkened room. she is surrounded by shiny coffins. she walks between them looking at each, stops next to one. there's a display of urns behind her. buffy lifts the lid of the coffin. it's empty.
scene direction: the lights come on. buffy looks up, startled.
giles: buffy, you're here.
scene direction: giles, dawn, and the funeral-home director enter. buffy drops the lid of the coffin and folds her arms.
giles: you all right?
buffy: yeah.
director: did you find something?
scene direction: buffy nods
buffy: this one.
scene direction: dawn walks over and stares at the coffin.
scene direction: director os
director: it's a fine choice. it speaks of your deep feeling for the deceased.
scene direction: giles and the director turn to leave. buffy follows but dawn remains. the others stop and look back at dawn.
buffy: you don't like it?
scene direction: dawn still looking at the coffin
dawn: no, it's not that. it's just ... what if mom ... what if she'd like something else better?
buffy: dawn...
dawn: i mean, how do we know for sure? she's the one who has to be in it forever.
buffy: dawn, maybe it wasn't such a good idea you coming along.
scene direction: dawn turns to look at her
dawn: it's fine. it's just ...
buffy: i'm serious. y-you shouldn't have to deal with this stuff.
director: if you'd like a few more minutes to decide- buffy: no. i, it's done, it's fine.
scene direction: director to dawn
director: okay?
scene direction: dawn nods.
buffy: okay.
scene direction: buffy turns and walks out with the men following. dawn remains staring at the coffin.
scene direction: wolf howl. opening credits.
scene change: *** act i ***
scene direction: fade in on dawn in the summers dining room, standing by a side table, looking at the card in a flower arrangement.
scene direction: giles os
giles: i checked prices at different florists, and the funeral home seems to be fairly competitive.
scene direction: dawn turns and we see the table, laid out with food. xander sits at left eating. giles and buffy sit side-by-side at the end of the table, looking at paperwork.
buffy: let's just go with that, it's easier.
scene direction: dawn sits at the other end
dawn: what color flowers?
scene direction: willow enters with a pitcher of water, pours a glass, and sits opposite xander.
buffy: uh, white.
scene direction: buffy looks at giles
buffy: they're nice.
giles: yeah.
scene direction: buffy to giles
buffy: uh, what about an announcement? people are gonna be expecting a wake after the burial unless we say something.
giles: um, well, we could put a, a line in the program expressing your mother's preference not to have one.
willow: there's no wake?
buffy: mom didn't like them. she said that potlucks are depressing enough as it is.
dawn: she said that? when?
buffy: uh, right before she went in for the operation. we had a talk about what she wanted ... in case.
scene direction: buffy looks down
dawn: she never said anything to me.
xander: i'm sure she just didn't wanna upset you, dawnster. now you better get to work on that dinner. you barely touched it.
buffy: you really should eat something.
dawn: why should i? you're not.
buffy: this isn't about- the cordless phone on the table rings. buffy sighs.
scene direction: buffy to giles
buffy: i'm all phoned out. will you? unless it's my dad.
giles: of course.
scene direction: giles answers the phone. buffy returns to the papers.
giles: hello? yes, yes they did.
scene direction: giles buffy looks at him
giles: thank you.
scene direction: giles gets up
giles: the, uh, funeral is at, uh, three tomorrow. do you know the brown brothers mortuary?
scene direction: giles walks out of the room, still talking. buffy and dawn look disappointed.
buffy: can't believe he still hasn't called.
xander: your dad's still awol, huh?
buffy: the number he left for us in spain is no good, and i've left messages everywhere. um, how about a line that just says, 'following the burial, there will be no wake'? or gathering?
scene direction: buffy shot of willow thinking about it
buffy: 'at the request of joyce, there will be no gathering'? uch, that sounds lame.
scene direction: buffy puts a hand to her forehead. willow gives her a concerned look, looks at dawn, gets up and begins clearing the table.
dawn: what are we gonna do? after, i mean. are we just gonna ... come back here?
buffy: uh ... i, i don't know. i guess so. um, how about 'at the request of the family, there will be no wake.' xander:
scene direction: buffy gets up to move into the chair next to buffy
buffy: good, yeah, it's got, uh...
scene direction: dawn to herself
dawn: i don't wanna be here.
buffy: should i put it at the top, or just a small line at the bottom?
scene direction: xander and buffy bend over the paperwork. willow re-enters, resumes clearing.
dawn: can i go to your place tomorrow?
willow: tomorrow?
dawn: after everything.
willow: um, well, maybe you and buffy should ... i-i don't mind.
scene direction: dawn to buffy
dawn: can i?
scene direction: buffy looks up from discussing with xander
buffy: huh?
dawn: can i go to willow's tomorrow after the service?
scene direction: buffy looks at willow, uncertainly
buffy: um ... i-if you want to. i guess so.
dawn: i'll, uh, get my sleeping bag out of the attic.
scene direction: she gets up and leaves. buffy returns to her paperwork.
scene change: cut to willow and xander leaving the house. xander closes the door and they start down the porch steps.
xander: you going home?
willow: i'm gonna stop by my mom's first. been doing that a lot lately.
xander: yeah. i actually might stop by your mom's too.
scene direction: xander she looks at him
xander: well, i'm not going to *my* place. those people are scary.
scene direction: xander looks up
xander: speaking of.
scene direction: we see spike coming up the walkway holding a bunch of flowers.
xander: you have got to be kidding.
scene direction: spike sighs
spike: i'm not going in.
xander: and you're not leaving those.
scene direction: shot of spike's hand holding the flowers.
xander: you actually think you're gonna score points with buffy this way?
spike: this isn't about buffy.
scene direction: spike walks closer
xander: bull. we're all hip to your doomed obsession.
spike: they're for joyce.
xander: like you care about her.
scene direction: spike sighs angrily. willow steps between them.
willow: guys, guys, not here.
spike: care? joyce was the only one of the lot of you that i could stand.
xander: and she's the only one with a daughter you wanted to shag. i'm touched.
spike: i liked the lady. understand, monkey boy? she was decent.
scene direction: spike xander and willow exchange a look
spike: she didn't put on airs. she always had a nice cuppa for me.
scene direction: willow looks sympathetic.
spike: and she never treated me like a freak.
xander: her mistake.
scene direction: spike scoffs
spike: think what you want.
scene direction: he throws the flowers to the ground and stomps off.
xander: un ... believable.
scene direction: willow looks at xander, bends to pick up the flowers.
xander: the guy thinks he can put on a big show and con buffy into being his sex monkey.
scene direction: willow looking at flowers
willow: xander...
scene direction: willow he looks at her
willow: he didn't leave a card.
scene direction: xander stares in the direction spike went, looking surprised. willow looks sad.
scene change: cut to a wall covered with old black-and-white pictures of people and children. pan across the wall. it's the hallway in the upstairs of the summers house. through the open door, we see buffy sitting on her bed staring at nothing. pan across more photos. we see dawn sitting on her bed doing the same.
fade to: graveyard, daylight. aerial shot of a group of people standing around the coffin. fade to a shot of buffy and dawn standing together. we can see xander and giles behind them. fade to a shot of the coffin.

scene direction: sound of a shovel digging into earth. dawn suddenly turns and buries her face in buffy's shoulder. buffy puts her arms around dawn, still staring at the coffin.
scene change: fade to shot of a shovel putting the first dirt on the coffin.
scene direction: minister os
minister: the lord bless her and keep her.
scene change: fade to overhead shot of the group as it breaks up. one by one the others hug buffy and dawn.

scene direction: shot of willow and tara. tara leans on willow's shoulder.
scene direction: minister os
minister: ...and give her peace.
scene change: fade to a shot of buffy and dawn standing alone at the grave, with willow and tara behind. dawn turns away from buffy and walks over to them.
scene change: cut to a closer shot. dawn takes willow's arm as the three of them exchange nods. tara moves over to buffy, taps her gently on the shoulder.
tara: hey, um, dawn's kind of ready to go. can we take her with us?
buffy: yeah. she should probably get out of here.
tara: what about you? we can wait if you want.
buffy: i'm fine. thank you.
scene direction: tara rejoins the others, whispers to them and they turn to leave. dawn looks back over her shoulder at buffy as they lead her away.
scene direction: shot of buffy staring at the grave with a small frown on her face. the camera lingers on her as the daylight lengthens to darkness behind her.
scene direction: shot of the grave with buffy's feet beside it. another pair of feet appears and walks up beside her.
angel: i'm sorry.
scene direction: we see angel standing beside buffy, both staring at the grave.
angel: i couldn't come sooner.
scene direction: buffy doesn't look at him, but she nods slightly and slips her hand into his. they stand looking at the grave, holding hands.
scene change: cut to willow and tara's dorm room. dawn lies on her sleeping bag on the floor, with willow and tara crouched on either side.
willow: oh, dawn. i wish i could ... help more.
scene direction: willow dawn doesn't look at her
willow: the only thing is ... it'll get better. i promise.
scene direction: dawn looks at her
dawn: you don't know that.
tara: sure she does. we're witches. we know stuff.
dawn: what?
scene direction: dawn looks from one to the other, sits up
dawn: life goes on, and i forget mom?
scene direction: dawn angry
dawn: is that what you're saying?
willow: not forget, no! i, you...
scene direction: willow looks to tara for help
tara: you make a place for her in your heart. it's sort of like she becomes a part of you. does that make sense?
scene direction: willow nods hopefully
willow: dawn ... hey, we don't have to talk about this now, uh, you could just go to sleep.
dawn: no.
scene direction: dawn gets up
dawn: i don't wanna sleep.
tara: okay, we can just ... sit, or, or whatever you want.
scene direction: dawn goes over to a low table where the magical supplies are laid out.
dawn: good. 'cause i know ... what i wanna do now.
willow: great.
scene direction: willow she and tara get up
willow: what are you up for?
dawn: you guys are witches ... and you do ... magic and ... stuff.
willow: you want us to teach you something? uh, like a-a glamour, or, or, i could ... make a stuffed animal dance.
dawn: i wanna do a spell. i wanna bring mom back.
scene direction: shot of willow and tara looking concerned.
scene direction: shot of dawn looking determined.
scene direction: blackout.
scene change: *** act ii ***
scene direction: fade in on anya and xander in bed. anya is on top of xander, both covered by sheets.
anya: mm.
scene direction: anya breathing heavily, lies down and puts her head on xander's chest
anya: that was different.
scene direction: xander breathing heavily
xander: yeah. it was more ... intense.
scene direction: anya nods
anya: it's because of joyce.
xander: right.
scene direction: xander pause
xander: huh?
anya: well, she got me thinking ... about ... how people die all the time, and ... how they get born too, and how you kind of need one so you can have the other. when i think about it that way, it ... makes death a little less sad, and ... sex a little more exciting.
xander: again i say, huh?
anya: well, i just think i understand sex more now. it's not just about two bodies smooshing together. it's about life.
scene direction: anya xander looks a little alarmed
anya: it's about *making* life.
scene direction: xander alarmed
xander: right, when ... two people are much older, and ... way richer, and far less stupid.
scene direction: anya lifts her head to look at him, laughs
anya: breathe. you're turning colors. i'm not ready to make life with you, but i could. *we* could. life could come out of our love and our smooshing, and that's beautiful.
scene direction: anya xander looks relieved
anya: it all makes me feel like i'm part of something bigger. like i'm more awake somehow.
scene direction: anya smiles
anya: you know?
xander: yeah, i do.
scene direction: he lifts his head and they kiss.
scene change: cut to willow and tara still reacting to dawn.
scene direction: tara steps forward
tara: of course you wanna bring your mother back, and ... i wish we could, but it's not possible.
dawn: why? you guys do magic for all kinds of things.
willow: we do, but...
tara: this is different. magic can't be used to alter the natural order of things.
dawn: but all you do is mess with the natural order of things. you, you make things float, a-and disappear, and- tara: but we don't mess with life and death.
scene direction: dawn shot of willow looking upset
dawn: dawn, i know how bad you hurt.
dawn: you don't.
scene direction: dawn upset
dawn: they put her in the ground.
tara: they did, and it's awful and unfair, but this isn't the way.
willow: i'm not even sure it's possible, dawn. i mean, i've ... seen things on resurrection, but ... there's books and stuff ... but i guess ... the spells ... backfire?
tara: that's not the point.
willow: that's not the point. the, the point is it's bad ... because ...
tara: because witches can't be allowed to alter the fabric of life for selfish reasons. wiccans took an oath a long time ago to honor that.
dawn: so it's possible ... to bring someone back? they wouldn't have taken an oath if thy didn't know they could do it.
tara: maybe they could, but we can't.
willow: she's right, dawn. it's too dangerous.
dawn: you said you wanted to help me.
scene direction: dawn makes an annoyed sound and goes to lie down on her sleeping back with her back turned. willow kneels beside her.
willow: dawn...
scene direction: willow touches dawn's shoulder but she jerks away, turns over so her back is to willow again. willow looks over at tara. tara looks concerned.
scene change: cut to graveyard, night. pan across trees and graves. we discover buffy and angel sitting on the ground under a tree, leaning against it. buffy has her legs curled under her and leans against angel's shoulder. they both look at the grave as they talk.
buffy: the funeral was ...
scene direction: buffy sighs
buffy: it was brutal, but it's tomorrow that i'm worried about.
angel: what's tomorrow?
buffy: that's exactly what i don't know. up until now, i ... i've had a road map. things to do every minute, having to do with mom.
angel: tomorrow the stuff of everyday living resumes.
buffy: and everybody expects me to know how to do it, because ...
scene direction: buffy sarcastically
buffy: i'm so strong.
angel: you just need some time. i'm sure everybody understands that.
buffy: time's not the issue. i can stick wood in vampires ... but mom was the strong one in real life. she always knew how to make things better ... just what to say.
angel: yeah ... you'll find your way. i mean, not all at once, but...
scene direction: buffy shakes her head
buffy: i don't know. i keep thinking about it ... when i found her. if i had just gotten there ten minutes earlier...
angel: you said they told you it wouldn't have made a difference.
buffy: they said ... "probably" ... wouldn't have made a difference. the exact thing they said ... was "probably." i haven't told that to anyone.
angel: doesn't make it your fault. you couldn't have done anything different.
scene direction: buffy annoyed sigh
buffy: i didn't even start cpr until they told me. i fell apart. that's how good i am at being a grownup.
angel: buffy...
buffy: and it'd be okay if it was just me i had to worry about. but dawn...
angel: look, it's okay. i know you don't feel like it now, but you are strong, buffy. you're gonna figure this out. and you have people to help you. you don't have to do this alone.
scene direction: buffy looks at the sky
buffy: it's gonna be light soon.
angel: i can stay in town as long as you want me.
buffy: how's forever? does forever work for you?
scene direction: she turns her head to look at angel, sighs and sits up to look him in the face.
scene direction: buffy apologetically
buffy: that's a bad idea. i'm seriously needy right now.
angel: let me worry about the neediness. i can handle it.
scene direction: they look at each other, then buffy leans in and kisses him. they kiss softly for a moment. then it gets a little more heated and they pull away, both breathing harder.
scene direction: buffy looks down
buffy: i told you.
scene direction: buffy angel sighs
buffy: you better go.
scene direction: angel another sigh
angel: i'm sorry.
scene direction: buffy firmly
buffy: no. i'm so grateful that you came, angel. i didn't think i was gonna be able to make it through the night.
scene direction: angel looks up at the sky
angel: well, we still have a few more minutes until i have to go.
buffy: good.
scene direction: she puts her head on his chest and leans against him. he puts his arm around her shoulders.
buffy: good.
scene direction: they sit quietly together.
scene change: cut to exterior hospital, night. ben walks out, wearing a jacket over his hospital scrubs. he turns a corner and see jinx lurking. jinx sees ben and walks toward him.
scene direction: ben angrily
ben: tell my sister i'm sick of running into her jawa rejects.
jinx: she ... bade me come to you. the news of your relationship with the slayer- ben: we don't have a relationship.
jinx: but ... you attempted to court her, did you not?
ben: you're more fun when i hit you.
jinx: it's just, glory ... would like to encourage this interest of yours in the slayer. it might lead to more information about the key.
ben: and why would i share that with the most unstable one?
jinx: time ... is running short, sir. every moment you fight glory, you're only fighting yourself, you see?
ben: fine. let the best me win. let glory understand this: i won't help her find the key. i would never do that to an innocent-
scene direction: ben stops himself
jinx: an innocent? the key? that's an interesting choice of words.
ben: no, that, that's not what i- jinx: i understand, sir. i'm sorry to have bothered you, i'll ... take my leave.
scene direction: he begins to leave but ben stops him.
ben: you understand what? when i said it's innocent, i didn't mean that the key is ... it's not a person.
jinx: of course not.
ben: you're gonna run and tell her, aren't you? do you understand what's going to happen if she finds the key? how many people are going to die?
jinx: please, i heard nothing.
ben: i can't let that happen.
scene direction: shot of ben's hand taking a dagger from jinx's belt.
ben: don't you see?
scene direction: ben stabs jinx with the dagger. jinx gasps.
ben: i can't.
scene direction: he pushes jinx to the ground, looks around nervously.
scene change: cut to dawn lying on the floor, covered with a blanket. we see her from the back.
scene direction: willow os
willow: we're heading down to breakfast.
scene direction: we see willow sitting beside dawn. dawn turns over to look at her.
dawn: i'm not hungry.
willow: oh. okay.
scene direction: willow we see tara standing nearby, holding schoolbooks. dawn sits up
willow: it's just, we have class after that, and i, i didn't know if you want to go home, or...
dawn: i was gonna sleep some more. giles said he'd pick me up whenever.
willow: oh, okay, great. sure, uh, hang out.
scene direction: willow smiling
willow: i have a, a break around lunchtime. i can come back.
scene direction: dawn sullen
dawn: i might not be here.
scene direction: willow still smiling
willow: well, i'll try my luck.
scene direction: dawn looks away.
tara: take care, dawn.
scene direction: willow gets up, picks up her bag, looks back at dawn. dawn doesn't look at her. willow walks to the door, pauses, framed in the shot with her bookcase behind her.
scene direction: close shot of willow's hand hanging by her side, the bookcase in the background. she wiggles her fingers, closing them into a fist. one of the books slides out so that it sticks out from the rest.
scene direction: willow walks out of the shot, revealing dawn behind her still sitting on the floor.
scene direction: shot of the bookcase with the one book sticking out. sound of the door closing.
scene direction: dawn gets up and goes to the bookcase, pulls out the book, opens it. it is titled history of witchcraft.
scene direction: dawn reading table of contents
dawn: 'age of levitation ... war of the warlocks...'
scene direction: dawn flips pages
dawn: 'resurrection -- a controversy born.' she flips the pages quickly, finds the spot, reads quickly, then looks up with a thoughtful expression.
scene change: cut to exterior magic shop, day.
scene change: cut to inside. dawn is pretending to dust while really examining the merchandise. we see anya doing something behind her. dawn moves over to a cart full of books and dusts them while reading the spines. anya follows, supervising. in the background we see giles. he looks over.
giles: you don't have to do that, dawn, just, just relax.
anya: yes, sit down. we have some very amusing chicken feet you can play with.
dawn: that's okay.
anya: don't you watch television? i thought all children despise effort and enjoy cartoons.
scene direction: dawn rearranges some books
dawn: um, i like being useful. it keeps my mind off things.
scene direction: giles approaches
giles: then useful you shall be. i can always use a hand.
scene direction: he comes over to the customer side of the counter. anya and dawn stand behind it.
scene direction: anya anxious
anya: but you have a hand. a paid hand. a hand that isn't the hand of illegal child labor.
scene direction: giles rolls his eyes
giles: anya.
scene direction: anya nods in understanding, turns to dawn
anya: but of course, it's wonderful that you find doing my job so distracting.
scene direction: anya smiles
anya: i am unthreatened. proceed.
scene direction: anya walks away
giles: yes, uh, carry on, dawn.
scene direction: giles starts to move away too, but dawn speaks up quickly to stop him.
dawn: is there anything i should know, like, um, off-limits stuff? willow told me that some of the books and things are ... kind of dangerous?
giles: quite right. um, but they're all labeled, and, and, and, uh, kept off the floor. most of our, uh, more potent texts and potions are all up there.
scene direction: he points upward. shot of the loft, a fairly narrow section full of bookcases.
giles: if anyone asks you about anything in that area, just come and get me.
scene direction: giles turns away
dawn: okay. anything else?
giles: oh, um, well, if you like, uh, i could teach you how to ... work the cash register, you can ring up sales.
dawn: cool.
scene direction: anya approaching
anya: ring up sales? with the money? she gets to fondle the money?
scene direction: giles gives her a look. the door-opening bell sounds.
scene direction: anya excited
anya: customer!
scene direction: anya walks off
anya: hello, customer!
scene direction: giles to dawn, resigned
giles: i'll just be a moment.
scene direction: giles moves off
scene direction: anya in background
anya: i'll help you!
scene direction: dawn as giles passes her
dawn: no problem.
scene direction: dawn watches to make sure both giles and anya are occupied. then she puts down her feather-duster and picks up her backpack. she climbs the ladder to the loft, looks over the books, grabs one and puts it in her pack. she picks up a small vial and it clinks against the others. she winces and looks to see if anyone heard, then puts it in her pack too, begins to climb back down. below, giles goes through the bead curtain (which separates the customer area from the office area) and dawn freezes until he moves past. then she continues climbing down. she reaches the bottom and turns to see giles standing a little bit away. he didn't see her climbing down.
giles: dawn.
dawn: uh-huh?
scene direction: dawn quietly lets her backpack drop to the floor
giles: do you wanna come watch this, uh, transaction that anya's doing? then i'll let you try.
dawn: you got it.
scene direction: she walks off, leaving the camera to linger on her backpack.
scene change: cut to graveyard, night. dawn kneels by the fresh grave, opening a jar. overhead shot of her. she scoops some dirt from the grave into the jar and caps it. she reaches over to smooth down the remaining dirt, looks around nervously, brushes her hands off. we see someone come up behind her.
spike: i hope it's just dirt you're after.
scene direction: dawn turns in surprise.
spike: if the spell calls for anything more than that, you're into zombie territory, and that's bad news.
scene direction: dawn shakes her head anxiously
dawn: spike, i-i wasn't...
spike: i know good and well what you're up to. that book you've got is infamous.
dawn: please ... don't tell buffy. i just ... i have to get her back.
scene direction: dawn anguished
dawn: i have to.
spike: i'm not gonna tell, little bit.
scene direction: dawn looks surprised.
spike: i'm gonna help.
scene direction: blackout.
scene change: *** act iii ***
scene direction: fade in on a phonograph with a record on the turnstile. the song is "tales of brave ulysses" by cream (same song that giles and joyce listened to in "band candy").
singer: ...you touch the distant beaches with tales of brave ulysses...
scene direction: pull out to reveal giles standing next to the phonograph in his apartment. he has a glass in his hand.
singer: how his naked ears were tortured by the sirens sweetly singing...
scene direction: giles goes over to a chair and sits.
singer: for the sparkling waves are calling you to kiss their white-laced lips...
scene direction: the song goes into a guitar riff. giles slowly takes a sip from his glass and sits staring at nothing.
scene change: cut to spike and dawn walking down the street of downtown sunnydale, night.
spike: i've never used this bloke's services myself, but there's talk. word is he knows everything there is to know about resurrection spells.
scene direction: dawn looks a little nervous.
spike: come on now, no worries.
dawn: you don't have to be all nice to me. i know why you're doing this.
spike: do you now? enlighten me.
scene direction: dawn frowns, stops walking
dawn: spike, i'm not stupid. you're, like, stalking my sister.
scene direction: dawn spike stops, turns to look at her
dawn: you'd do anything to get in good with her.
scene direction: spike takes a few steps closer; firmly
spike: buffy never hears about this, okay?
scene direction: spike looks around
spike: found out what i was doing, she'd drive a redwood through my chest.
dawn: then, if you don't want credit, why are you helping me?
scene direction: spike looking at the ground, quietly
spike: i just don't like to see summers women take it so hard on the chin, is all.
scene direction: spike looks up, speaks angrily
spike: and i'm dead serious. you breathe a word of this to buffy, i'll see to it that *you* end up in the ground. got it?
dawn: yeah. got it.
scene change: cut to glory's apartment. glory is walking down the stairs into the living room, followed by several sycophant demons.
glory: where is he? he should have been back hours ago.
murk: i'm sure jinx is on his way, your ... new and improvedness. he's most loyal to- glory: hey! he better be loyal.
scene direction: the door opens and two more demons enter, half-carrying jinx between them. he has his arms around their shoulders but is conscious.
glory: jinxie?
scene direction: she rushes forward and takes one of jinx's arms around her shoulders. the displaced demon goes to shut the door.
glory: oh, no, no! oh, mind the rug, honeys, blood's a bitch.
scene direction: glory to jinx
glory: was this the slayer, i'll pull her wings off!
jinx: no.
scene direction: they put jinx on a sofa.
jinx: it was ben.
glory: ben?
scene direction: glory turns away
glory: ben? oh god, you pointless, stupid lout! oh, i hate you, i hate you,
scene direction: glory pulls several handfuls of hair off her head
glory: i hate youuuuu!
jinx: the key! he told me.
glory: the key?
scene direction: she turns back to him, still holding handfuls of hair.
glory: what about the key?
jinx: he indicated that it was a person, most ...
scene direction: jinx searching for words
jinx: ... highest ... you.
scene direction: glory smiling hopefully
glory: the key's in human form?
jinx: i believe so ...
scene direction: jinx searching for words
jinx: good one.
scene direction: glory delighted
glory: ahh!
scene direction: she sits on the sofa and pulls jinx into a hug.
glory: jinx, you robed stud, you're my man! i'm even gonna let you slide on the lame toadying on account of your dying and stuff.
scene direction: jinx looks a little surprised to hear this. he looks to glory but she is talking to the other demons. jinx looks from her to the other demons to his wound as glory talks.
glory: so, the key's all secreted away in a flesh wrapper!
scene direction: glory gets up and paces
glory: this narrows the search from now on in a serious way, i mean we didn't have a clue. it could have been a log, or, or a bicycle pump, or whatever, am i right?
scene direction: jinx has fallen asleep or unconscious on the sofa.
glory: uch, get him fixed, would ya?
scene direction: glory smiling, plops down on another sofa
glory: i wanna hear the whole story again, without all that annoying moaning.
scene change: cut to an apartment. a black cat jumps over a globe in the foreground and runs offscreen as the door opens and we see spike. he holds the door open for dawn, who enters cautiously.
dawn: this place belongs to a magic guy? it smells like grandpa.
scene direction: spike closes the door. the camera pulls back so we can see piles of books and papers all over a table.
spike: hey!
scene direction: we see a door leading into another room, partly obscured by a curtain. behind the curtain there's a figure standing.
spike: anybody home?
scene direction: the figure moves through the curtains. spike and dawn look apprehensive.
scene direction: the figure emerges and turns out to be a small elderly man wearing glasses and a bathrobe. he looks surprised to see them.
doc: i know you.
spike: i don't think so, mate.
doc: no, no, you're that guy, that, that guy, hangs around down at the corner mart.
scene direction: doc spike looks confused
doc: big into dominoes, aren't you?
spike: can't say as i am. look, we came here because-
scene direction: spike stops because doc is laughing
doc: that's crazy, isn't it? i mean, i, i, i'd swear, you were that guy.
scene direction: doc dawn looks nervous
doc: i mean, your hair's a different color and you're a vampire, but uh, other than that...
scene direction: dawn to spike
dawn: maybe we should just go.
doc: no. now, just because the lights are dim doesn't mean the juice is all gone. what can i do for you?
spike: this one's mum kicked it a few days back.
doc: ohh. i'm so sorry.
scene direction: doc dawn looks down
spike: so we were wondering, what's to be done about it. heard you were the one to ask.
scene direction: doc concerned
doc: ohh ... no, no, that's, uh, you don't wanna mess with that. uh, i know some tonics, uh, make the grieving fly by- dawn:
scene direction: doc shakes head
doc: i don't want any tonics.
doc: either one of you witches? got any experience with, uh, spells of this magnitude?
scene direction: dawn shakes her head. spike just looks grim.
doc: didn't think so.
scene direction: suddenly he reaches out and pulls some hair from dawn's head. she gasps.
dawn: ow!
scene direction: spike steps forward but doesn't do anything. doc takes the hair over to a lamp and holds it up to the light. dawn gives spike an angry look, holding the side of her head.
doc: well, your mother's a good candidate, at least. strong dna.
dawn: right.
scene direction: doc turns and begins examining the stuff on his shelves. he hums the theme from prokofiev's "peter and the wolf." dawn watches.
scene direction: shot of doc with his back turned. from underneath his bathrobe a greenish, scaly tail pokes out. dawn sees it and her eyes widen. she turns to spike, but he is lighting a cigarette and by the time dawn catches his attention, doc has turned again and the tail is hidden again.
scene direction: doc continues humming, looks at a pile of books, picks up a large one and smiles triumphantly at dawn, holding it up. he carries the book over to a table, still humming the same tune. dawn and spike follow. doc puts the book on the table and flips the pages.
dawn: i've gathered some ingredients. but the spell i found ... there's things on it i don't understand.
doc: we've got the ghora demon standing between you and success, that's the translation you were missing.
spike: ghora, i've heard of those. they local?
doc: yeah, they like to stick close to the hellmouth.
scene direction: doc spike nods. doc reads from the book
doc: egg of the ghora gives life.
scene direction: doc looks up at dawn
doc: it's key to the spell.
dawn: can you buy it, this ... egg, or- doc: if it was as easy as making an omelet, everyone would try it.
scene direction: dawn dawn looks chastised
dawn: no. you have to steal the egg from the nest of the demon.
scene direction: dawn looks at spike
dawn: and the ghora won't be happy about it.
spike: where do we find this demon?
doc: first things first. we'll need an image of your mother. a photo, a painting.
dawn: no problem.
doc: once you get all the ingredients together, put them in the center
scene direction: doc makes circular gestures
doc: of a sacred circle. with the photo of your mother.
scene direction: doc dawn nods
doc: then...
scene direction: doc reaches for a small notebook
doc: say this incantation...
scene direction: doc begins to write
doc: three times.
scene direction: doc spike listens closely
doc: she won't appear, you know, poof.
scene direction: doc dawn listens very carefully
doc: it'll take ... a while,
scene direction: doc smiling
doc: but she will come to you.
scene direction: doc tears off the page, hands it to dawn
doc: got it?
dawn: got it.
doc: oh. anything goes wrong, the only way to reverse the spell ... is to destroy the image of your mother, understand?
dawn: i'll do it right.
doc: it's a tricky spell, girl. i can't say for sure your mother will come back exactly like she was.
scene direction: doc shots of dawn and spike listening
doc: sometimes these ... things ... get a little off.
dawn: but she'll still be my mother.
scene direction: dawn frowns
dawn: won't she?
doc: more or less.
scene direction: he walks off. dawn looks apprehensive.
scene direction: dawn weakly
dawn: good.
scene direction: dawn a little stronger
dawn: good.
scene direction: dawn and spike go to the door. doc follows.
spike: and the ghora?
doc: oh, right, sorry. um, go in the sewer entrance near tracy street. the opening's, um, on the left. can't miss it. just follow that down.
scene direction: spike goes to open the door as dawn takes out a wad of money and begins removing some bills.
doc: no, no. keep your money.
scene direction: doc smiles, removes his glasses
dawn: oh. thank you.
scene direction: still smiling, doc holds out his hand and they shake.
doc: you just keep in touch now. let me know how it goes.
scene direction: dawn smiles slightly and nods.
scene direction: closeup of doc's face. suddenly, his eyes go all black (the whites turn black too). dawn jerks her hand out of his in startlement. doc pulls his own hand back as dawn takes a step backward, apprehensive.
dawn: i-i-i will.
scene direction: spike opens the door. dawn gives doc one last nervous look and exits. spike follows her out, closing the door.
scene direction: shot of doc still smiling. as soon as the door closes, his smile drops away.
scene change: cut to spike and dawn walking down a dark alley. spike carries an axe. they come to a spot where the wall looks all slimy and rough.
dawn: it's here. just like he said.
scene direction: spike looking into the hole
spike: well, at least we know the old coot isn't completely daft. look, you better let me snatch this egg thing on my own.
dawn: no way. i'm going.
scene direction: spike firmly
spike: no ... you are not. i've got no idea what's down there.
dawn: you need me, spike. somebody's gotta get the egg while you distract the ghora. now come on.
scene direction: she turns and strides into the opening. spike shakes his head, sighs and hefts his axe.
spike: well, what do you know. bitty buffy.
scene direction: he follows dawn into the hole.
scene change: cut to dawn making her way down stairs. the walls are stone, covered with vines. spike follows close behind. we can hear the demon growling.
scene direction: they reach the bottom and look up.
scene direction: shot of the demon, which looks like a huge lizardy thing sleeping on a pile of rocks. the noises are actually snores. spike and dawn move over to the wall and hide behind some vines.
dawn: doesn't look so bad.
scene direction: spike scoffs
spike: wait till it wakes up. that's usually when the bad starts.
scene direction: shot of the nest behind the demon's tail. there are several eggs in it, about the size and shape of footballs but pink with purple spots.
dawn: i can't get to the eggs unless it moves. no way.
scene direction: spike grinning
spike: i'll make it move. you just be ready.
scene direction: he moves past her and strides toward the demon, lifting the axe.
spike: hey! ghora! heads up.
scene direction: the demon wakes and sits up. it has three heads.
scene direction: spike staring
spike: right then. heads it is.
scene direction: dawn comes forward.
scene direction: spike hits one of the heads with his axe. the heads rear back and then strike at him.
spike: ?
scene direction: spike sorry, can't make out this line
scene direction: dawn hurries over to the nest and tries to grab an egg but the demon's tail lashes at her. she jumps back as the demon tries to twist around and look at her.
spike: hey, get away from her!
scene direction: spike hits the demon some more, regaining its attention. dawn grabs an egg and runs back to the base of the stairs.
dawn: spike, come on!
spike: that's it.
scene direction: spike gives one last thrust and buries the axe in one of the demon's necks. he runs to rejoin dawn.
scene direction: as they start up the stairs, dawn trips and drops the egg. it bursts open, leaking bright blue stuff.
spike: leave it, dawn.
dawn: i can't. mom.
spike: it's too dangerous and i haven't got- dawn turns and runs back toward the nest.
spike: -a weapon!
scene direction: dawn runs to the nest, screams as the demon turns to confront her. one of the heads is inches from her face.
scene direction: spike throws stones at the demon's head. it turns to him and lashes at him with its tail, knocking him over.
scene direction: dawn grabs another egg and gets up.
scene direction: one of the demon's heads bites spike in the stomach and he screams with pain. he shoves it off and gets up as dawn backs away quickly.
spike: no, that's it.
scene direction: spike gets up, holding his side with one hand. with the other, he grabs the axe from the demon's neck and slams it into the demon's chest. the demon screams as blue blood seeps out. spike pulls the axe out again.
dawn: spike!
scene direction: spike joins her at the stairs. the demon continues screaming.
dawn: sorry!
spike: did you get it?
scene direction: dawn holds up the egg to show him.
spike: don't be sorry then.
scene direction: he goes up the stairs, pulling her after him as the demon's noises fade away.
scene change: cut to exterior summers house, night.
dawn voiceover: osiris... giver of darkness...
scene change: cut to dawn's bedroom. she has a sheet on the floor with a circle of candles on it, and she kneels by it, pouring something from a vial, onto her hands. she smears it on the sheet, drawing a circle around a cauldron in the middle.
dawn: taker of life ... god of gods... accept my offering. bone, flesh, breath ...
scene direction: she completes the circle.
dawn: yours ... eternally.

scene direction: blackout.
scene change: *** act iv ***
scene direction: fade in on willow and tara's dorm room. tara sits on the bed studying. willow lies on her stomach next to tara, writing in her diary.
willow: what did i have for breakfast this morning? do you remember?
tara: hmm?
willow: i-i wanna say bagel, but i think that was yesterday. you had two eggs sunny-side-up.

tara: down to every last bagel.
scene direction: willow grins, looks tara in the eye
willow: down to every last everything i do with you.
scene direction: willow returns to writing, the fingers of her other hand still twined with tara's. tara looks past willow toward the bookcase.
tara: huh.
scene direction: willow stops writing
willow: what?
tara: what happened to history of witchcraft?
scene direction: tara gets up as willow tries to hide her guilty look.
willow: i, uh, i-it isn't there?
scene direction: willow sits up as tara goes to the bookcase and checks out the empty space.
tara: dawn must have taken it.
scene direction: willow anxiously
willow: no she didn't! did she?
scene direction: willow gets up and goes quickly toward tara
tara: this is bad, this is really bad.
scene direction: willow anxiously
willow: but, i-it's just a history book. i-it might answer some of her questions. i-i don't think she could do any ... harm with that stuff, could she?
tara: well, it's not a how-to guide, but it refers to specific resurrection spells and potions.
willow: but i-i didn't ... i mean ... hey! how'd she know that?
tara: i-i don't know, but ... god, what else did she take?
willow: nothing! i-i think. i think n... she took nothing else. but maybe she did, and we should probably look. because who knows? i-i don't.
tara: no, no, we can't waste time on that now. we don't know what she's up to.
scene direction: willow nodding
willow: we have to call buffy. now.
scene change: cut to buffy entering the summers house. the phone is ringing. buffy tosses down her keys, pulls off her jacket as she hurries over to the phone.
buffy: hello?
scene change: cut to the cauldron in dawn's room. we see that it is filled with the blue goo from the ghora egg. pan up across the broken eggshell and the piece of paper with the spell written on it. dawn is still kneeling, with her hands on her knees.
dawn: bone ... flesh ... breath ... yours eternally. bone, flesh, breath, i beg of you, return to me.

scene direction: dawn doesn't move.

scene direction: buffy rushes over to dawn
buffy: what have you done?

buffy: dawn! dawn!
scene direction: dawn reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns to face buffy, who comes right up in her face.
buffy: you have no idea what you're messing with. who knows what you actually raised, what's gonna come through that door!
scene direction: dawn tearful
dawn: no, i-i know. it'll be her.
buffy: no. now, tara told me that these spells go bad all the time. people come back ... wrong.

dawn: no!
scene direction: dawn wrenches free of buffy's hold, grabs the picture of joyce and goes into the living room. buffy follows.
buffy: dawn, you know this is wrong. you know you can't let this happen. not to mom.
scene direction: dawn quietly
dawn: but i need her. i don't care if she...
scene change: cut to shot of a pair of feet walking on grass. the feet are wearing pale blue pumps, and we can see the hem of a pale blue skirt.

buffy: what?! of course you do. you have me!

buffy: that's not true.
scene direction: dawn harshly
dawn: yes it is. mom ... died, and it's like you don't even care.
scene direction: buffy shocked, with tears in her eyes
buffy: of course i care. how can you even think that?
dawn: how can i not? you haven't even cried. you've just been running around like it's been some big chore or something. cleaning up after mom's mess.

scene direction: dawn frowns in confusion.
buffy: and i'm trying. dawn, i am, i am really trying to take care of things, but i don't even know what i'm doing. mom always knew.
dawn: nobody's asking you to be mom.
buffy: well, who's gonna be if i'm not? huh, dawn? have you even thought about that? who's gonna make things better?
scene direction: buffy crying harder
buffy: who's gonna take care of us?
dawn: buffy...
buffy: i didn't mean to push you away, i didn't. i just, i couldn't let you see me.
scene direction: dawn begins to cry too.
buffy: oh god, dawnie...
