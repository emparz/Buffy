scene direction: fade in on hospital cat scan room. joyce lies on the machine, wearing a hospital gown. we see a glass window, behind which two technicians are standing. the machine makes noises as the part joyce is lying on slides into it. close-up on joyce's face. she closes her eyes. long shot of the machine. close-up on joyce's face again, her eyes open again. she closes them again.
scene change: cut to dawn fiddling with a bracelet on her right wrist. a hand comes into view and gives her a can of soda. it's buffy. dawn looks up at her. she sits down next to dawn and opens her own can.
dawn: what is a cat scan exactly?
buffy: i don't know. it's some ... x-ray, i guess.
dawn: where do they get the cat scan from? i mean, do they test it on cats or ... or does the machine sort of look like a cat?
buffy: dawn, i'm really...
scene direction: she stops herself as dawn gives her an apprehensive look. buffy puts her arm around dawn and brings dawn's head to rest on her shoulder. she kisses the top of dawn's head.
scene direction: long shot of them sitting there in the hospital waiting room as various staff people walk by.
scene change: cut to a telephone book, open to a page where we see a large advertisement for the magic box.
tara voiceover: "your one-stop spot to shop for all your occult needs."
scene direction: we see tara and giles standing behind the counter, looking at the ad.
tara: catchy.
giles: think so?
tara: uh-huh. in a ... hard to read sort of way, but i think it's great.
giles: oh.
scene direction: tara moves away as giles studies the ad and soundlessly mouths the words to himself. the door opens and anya enters, followed by xander and willow. anya immediately begins straightening the merchandise on the shelves.
xander: i'm just saying, i think it's rude.
willow: i wouldn't call it rude.
xander: rude-ish. rude-esque. whatever you want to call it. when a person makes a "destroy all vampires" date, it's simple courtesy to wait for your co-destroyers. am i right, giles?
giles: i'm almost certain you're not, but to be fair, i wasn't listening.
tara: oh, the-the new phone book's in with mr. giles' ad.
scene direction: anya races around the counter, shoving past tara.
willow: oh, nice.
anya: yay! am i mentioned?
scene direction: anya looking eagerly at the ad
giles: not as such.
scene direction: anya disappointed
anya: oh.
xander: okay, we were supposed to hook up with riley this morning, to take on a nest o'vamps holed up in a tomb? so we get there, and guess what? tell him, will.
willow: tomb go boom.
xander: yep. captain america blowed it up real good. all by his lone wolf lonesome.
giles: hmm, uh, rather reckless of him.
scene direction: giles we see anya still studying the ad.
xander: i'd say very rather.
giles: all that aside, i should think you'd be pleased to avoid the confrontation.
anya: that's what i've been saying. i mean, i, for one, didn't want to start my day with a slaughter.
scene direction: anya suddenly gets a look of realization on her face; excitedly
anya: which really just goes to show how much i've grown!
scene direction: anya smiles hugely. willow and tara grin at each other
giles: yes, well, um, in any event, uh, since you're all here, tara and i could use your help researching buffy's mysterious woman.
xander: oh yeah, this has been fruitful. trying to look up something you ... never saw and don't know the name of.
anya: just do what i do: flip through the pages and look busy.
willow: it'd be nice if we knew where she was, where she's hiding out.
xander: no doubt lurking around some sewer or condemned church or rat-infested warehouse. you know, the usual haunts.
scene change: cut to a beautiful, well-appointed apartment. glory reclines on a round bed surrounded by shoeboxes. a demon dressed in monk's clothing is kneeling on the floor, holding a scroll.
dreg: most beauteous and supremely magnificent one, this dark spell i hold in my worthless and scabby hand is our gift to you, most tingly and wonderful glorificus...
scene direction: glory trying on a shoe
glory: please, call me glory. and get up, looking at you is hurting my neck.
scene direction: dreg gets up
dreg: forgive me, shiny special one. i beg of you to rip out my inadequate tongue.
scene direction: glory reaches out her hand
glory: gimme.
scene direction: dreg grins and walks forward, sticking out his tongue. glory waits till he's close enough and then grabs the scroll.
dreg: oh.
scene direction: dreg laughs nervously
dreg: i thought...
scene direction: dreg still laughing as glory examines the paper
dreg: you should know, your elaborate marvelous-ness, that this dark incantation has been lost for eons...
glory: uh-huh.
scene direction: glory trying on another shoe
dreg: and great dangers have been faced to...
scene direction: glory sticking her leg straight up in the air
glory: does this pump make my ankle look bony?
dreg: no! no, no, your terrifically smooth one, it is the epitome of ankles.
scene direction: dreg glory ignores him, trying on another shoe
dreg: to touch such an ankle would be - but i'm not touching. i'm backing away.
scene direction: glory kicks out her foot and the shoe flies off it, hitting dreg in the forehead.
dreg: ow! thank you.
glory: dreg, is it?
scene direction: glory gets up
dreg: yes. dreg. your creamy coolness has honored me by speaking my name. your voice is like a thousand sweet songbirds that-
scene direction: glory irritated
glory: yeah, i never tire of hearing that. look, just so we're clear, the spell's gonna work, right?
scene direction: glory dreg nods anxiously. glory turns and goes to the window, peeking around the curtain
glory: i mean, nothing worse than a gift that doesn't work. then i'd have to get all mad and kill you!
scene direction: glory apologetically
glory: it's this whole big thing.
dreg: it will work, your extremeness. provided you have the other items you need.
glory: don't worry. i'll have them all right.
scene direction: she walks past him to where a copy of the phone book is sitting open to the page with giles' ad. she tears out the page and smiles at it.
glory: i'll have it all.
scene direction: wolf howl. opening credits.
scene change: *** act i ***
scene direction: exterior of the summers house, day. riley approaches the front door and finds it slightly ajar. he knocks and walks in.
scene direction: riley calling
riley: hello? buffy?
scene direction: he takes off his jacket, then notices something on the floor and picks it up. it's a blanket. he frowns, looks up the stairs, drops both blanket and jacket and starts up the stairs.
scene change: cut to spike holding a pink sweater up to his face and inhaling deeply. he lowers the sweater, sighing happily, then takes another sniff as riley appears behind him.
riley: what are you doing in here?
scene direction: spike whirls around and we see he's in buffy's bedroom. he quickly hides the sweater behind his back.
spike: what, me? i was um ... uh ... what are *you* doing here?
riley: looking for the girl who's gonna rip your arms off when she finds out you were in her bedroom.
scene direction: riley walks forward.
spike: oh yeah? well ... me too.
scene direction: riley glances down, makes a move toward spike's hands. spike flinches backward and tries to maneuver so riley can't see what he's holding.
scene direction: riley bemused
riley: were you ... were you just smelling her sweater?
scene direction: spike scoffs
spike: no.
scene direction: spike riley glares at him
spike: well, yeah, all right, i did. it's a ... predator thing, nothin' wrong with it. just ... know your enemy's scent, whet the appetite for a hunt.
scene direction: spike he sniffs the sweater again
spike: ah, that's the stuff! slayer musk, it's bitter and aggravating!
scene direction: spike presses the sweater against his face and makes angry growling noises. riley snatches the sweater away from him, tosses it aside, then grabs spike by the front of his shirt.
riley: out.
scene direction: as riley hustles spike out, spike grabs a piece of lacy pink underwear from a drawer.
scene direction: riley hurries down the stairs, pulling spike after him.
spike: hey, watch it! easy, you're bruising the leather!
scene direction: spike they reach the bottom of the stairs and riley lets go
spike: look. i know for a bleeding fact the slayer wouldn't mind me being here.
riley: right. what's a little sweater-sniffing between sworn enemies.
spike: your girl in the habit of buying her enemies drinks? 'cause she spent the better part of last night with me,
scene direction: spike smugly
spike: doing just that.
riley: 'cause you guys are such tight pals.
spike: yeah.
riley: that's good. tell me another.
spike: okay, how 'bout this one. twice in recent memory, she's had the lover-wiccas do a de-invite on the house. keep out specific vamps. ever ask yourself why she's never taken my name off the guest list?
scene direction: riley falters for a moment
riley: because you're harmless.
spike: oh yeah, right.
scene direction: spike scoffs
spike: takes one to know, i suppose. least i still got the attitude.
scene direction: spike looking riley up and down
spike: what do you got, a piercing glance? face it, white bread. buffy's got a type, and you're not it. she likes us dangerous, rough, occasionally bumpy in the forehead region.
scene direction: spike patronizingly
spike: not that she doesn't like you ... but sorry charlie, you're just not dark enough.
scene direction: riley scowls, grabs spike, opens the door and thrusts spike out into the sunlight.
spike: hey ... hey! hey! hey!
riley: am i dark enough for you now?
spike: bloody pull me back in, you sod, i'm starting to sizzle!
riley: you don't know anything about buffy, you never did. i'm the one who knows what she needs.
spike: oh yeah? that's why you're with her at hospital right now, giving her what she needs.
scene direction: riley pulls spike back inside
riley: what are you talking about?
spike: don't you know, didn't she tell you?
riley: you tell me.
spike: mum's sickly. buffy took her to the hospital for a bit of prod 'n probe. bite-sized one went too.
scene direction: spike needling
spike: you know, it's-it's funny her not calling you about that. i've known since last night.
scene direction: riley grabs spike and shoves him outside. sizzling noises.
scene direction: spike os
spike: blanket! blanket!
scene direction: riley kicks the blanket out and slams the door. he leans against the banister looking conflicted.
scene change: cut to buffy in the hospital, pacing outside a door marked "examination room." she twiddles her fingers nervously and sighs. a hand appears and grabs her shoulder; she spins around.
scene direction: buffy sighs
buffy: riley.
riley: sorry. i heard. i thought maybe you'd ... need ...
scene direction: buffy hugs him.
buffy: i do. i do. i'm glad.
scene direction: buffy pulls back
buffy: i just, i-i didn't ... i mean, until we knew what it was...
riley: i understand. how's she doing?
scene direction: buffy turns to look at the door.
buffy: well, she just had a cat scan. i was about to go in and find out. will you ... sit with dawn while i talk to mom? she's in the waiting room.
riley: yeah, yeah, you got it.
scene direction: buffy nods, sighs, turns away. riley turns in the opposite direction.
scene change: cut to buffy entering a darkened room.
buffy: hi.
scene direction: we see joyce and a doctor standing in front of a set of cat scan images stuck on a lighted wall. they turn.
buffy: may i come in?
joyce: oh, of course, baby, come on in. uh, where's dawn?
buffy: uh, she's with riley. they're watching tv in the waiting room.
dr. isaacs: excuse me, i'm just gonna check on the status of the or.
scene direction: dr. isaacs exits
buffy: the or?
joyce: dr isaacs says i'm ... lucky there's one available on such short notice. some people wait for days, sometimes, weeks.
scene direction: buffy softly
buffy: mom, what did they find?
joyce: a shadow. i've got a shadow.
scene direction: joyce looks at the images on the wall
joyce: somewhere ... over there ... he showed it to me, but, um ... they have to do a biopsy to find out exactly what it is.
scene direction: buffy looks upset. they hug.
scene direction: joyce voice breaking
joyce: doctor says it's too early to be concerned.
buffy: right.
scene direction: buffy pulls back to look joyce in the face
buffy: no concern.
joyce: just a shadow.
scene direction: they smile bravely at each other. buffy turns to look at the images again.
willow voiceover: i just wish we knew what we were dealing with.
scene change: cut to magic box. the table is spread with books, xander, tara, and willow sitting around it.
willow: it feels like we're going around in circles.
scene direction: in the background we see anya looking at bookshelves and a customer walking through the shop.
xander: our circles are going around in circles. we've got dizzy circles here, giles.
scene direction: the customer walks up to the counter and hands giles an item.
giles: ah, weeping buddha, shoulders your spiritual burden.
scene direction: giles wraps the item
giles: makes a lovely paperweight too.
tara: maybe she's not in the books.
willow: what do you mean?
tara: i mean, what if she's not a demon or sorceress or spirit or whatever these books cover?
scene direction: tara giles looks over at her as he rings up the sale
tara: what if she's something else altogether?
giles: thank you, come again.
scene direction: giles hands item to customer and comes out from behind counter toward the table
giles: something new, you mean?
scene direction: tara shakes head
tara: something old. so old it pre-dates the written word.
scene direction: willow thinks of something
willow: giles, the dagon sphere. you said that was created to repel...
giles: that which cannot be named.
scene direction: giles removes glasses thoughtfully
willow: so i'm thinking maybe she...
giles: predates language itself?
scene direction: willow nods significantly. xander looks puzzled.
xander: well hey, if it means i don't have to read any more, woo! and might i add a big hoo!
giles: if tara's right, then we're blind. there's ... there's no way we can determine ... her moves, her habits, where she'll turn up next-
scene direction: he turns around, putting his glasses back on, and is confronted by glory. she has a few items in her hands.
giles: oh! i beg your-
scene direction: glory abruptly
glory: uh-huh.
scene direction: glory holds up items
glory: i want these.
giles: yes, of course!
scene direction: giles hurries behind the counter, taking the items
giles: um, you find everything all right?
glory: no problemo.
scene direction: glory takes out her purse as giles scribbles on a receipt
giles: that's, um...
scene direction: shot of xander, tara, and willow sitting at the table, ignoring giles and his "customer." cash register noises. they continue looking at the books.
giles: your receipt.
scene direction: giles hands receipt to an impatient glory
giles: and ...
scene direction: giles puts items in a paper bag
giles: thank you!
scene direction: giles hands bag to glory. she smiles and leaves. giles watches her, smiling.
scene direction: giles turns back to the others, removes glasses again
giles: she could be anywhere. but if she is as powerful as, uh, buffy says, i imagine it won't be long before she makes herself known.
scene direction: shot of the others sighing and turning back to the books.
scene change: cut to hospital. dawn is curled up asleep on an armchair. riley drapes his jacket over her and crouches beside her. across the room we see buffy sitting and watching them. riley comes over to sit next to her. she puts her head on his shoulder. he kisses the top of her head.
scene direction: suddenly buffy sees the doctor approaching. she gets up and walks over to him, leaving riley behind.
dr. isaacs: everything went fine, they're moving her into recovery now.
scene direction: buffy nervous
buffy: do we have the results yet?
dr. isaacs: let's, um, sit down over here for a minute.
buffy: no!
scene direction: buffy more quietly
buffy: excuse me, no, i ... i don't mean to be rude, i just, i've been sitting for hours, i don't wanna sit. i just ... tell me, please.
dr. isaacs: your mother has ... the term is low-grade glioma. it's a brain tumor. the clinical name is oligodendroglioma. it's in the left hemisphere of the cerebrum. in your mother's case the tumor seems to have started there. in other words, it hasn't spread from another part of the body...
scene direction: he keeps talking but his voice fades out as the camera zooms slowly in on buffy's dismayed face. blackout.
scene change: *** act ii ***
scene direction: fade back in on buffy still listening to the doctor.
dr. isaacs: i know this is very difficult, and, uh, because of the nature of your mother's illness ... unfortunately, things may progress very quickly.
buffy: things? what things?
dr. isaacs: symptoms. there's a fair variety that might present. loss of vision or appetite, lack of muscle control, uh, mood swings...
buffy: but what can we do?
dr. isaacs: well, not much, until we determine if the tumor's operable. which we are working on.
scene direction: dr. isaacs leads buffy over to some chairs and they sit
buffy: is there something that i ... i mean ... can i help?
dr. isaacs: well, there's some literature you might want to look at. if we aren't able to go in surgically, there are a number of new treatments that are very promising. your mother's prognosis is a lot better today than it would have been only a year ago. even if the tumor's not operable, she has a real chance.
buffy: what's a real chance?
dr. isaacs: nearly one out of three patients with this condition does just fine.
scene direction: dr. isaacs buffy sits back looking shocked. camera stays on her face as the doctor continues.
dr. isaacs: now, let me ask. does your mother's insurance company require copies of the mri and pathology reports?
buffy: i'm not sure.
scene direction: dr. isaacs os
dr. isaacs: well, just let me know as soon as possible. and i could use some information regarding your mom's lifestyle and home environment. for instance, does she use a cell phone?
scene direction: buffy frowns
buffy: uh, i think so. uh, yeah, she um, she-she has one of those ear things.
dr. isaacs: ok, is your house near any power lines, chemical plants, waste disposal facilities?
buffy: uh ... i-i don't know. maybe.
dr. isaacs: well, the more we know...
buffy: i'm sorry.
scene direction: the doctor scowls and writes on his clipboard. ben approaches and puts his hand on the doctor's shoulder.
ben: excuse me doc, but they told me you're needed in icu.
dr. isaacs: excuse me, miss summers.
scene direction: dr. isaacs gets up
scene direction: buffy distracted
buffy: uh, it's okay.
scene direction: dr. isaacs leaves and ben sits down next to buffy.
ben: thought you looked like you needed a break. guy's great, but he doesn't have the bone in his head that tells him when to back off.
buffy: you mean ... they, they didn't need him?
ben: well, i'm sure someone does somewhere, they always do. he really is a good doctor. your mom's in good hands.
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: thank you. it's ben, right?
ben: right.
buffy: he, um, he was just telling me that there's nothing i can do.
ben: yeah, i'm gonna tell you the same thing. give yourself a break. listen, your mom's gonna be unconscious for at least another six, seven hours.
buffy: a break?
ben: well, i just mean go out, get some air. come back later on this evening, talk to the doc then if you want. my unsolicited advice of the day.
scene direction: he leaves. buffy leans her head back and sighs deeply.
scene direction: riley os
riley: buffy.
scene direction: riley approaches and buffy gets up to hug him.
buffy: it's bad.
riley: i know.
buffy: i ...
scene direction: buffy grabs her coat and puts it on
buffy: i have to do something.
riley: do something?
buffy: yeah, like, you know, magic, like a healing spell.
riley: buffy ... people get sick. i don't think magic-
buffy: that attitude's not helping.
scene direction: buffy riley looks cowed
buffy: i have to try.
riley: okay.
buffy: i need to talk to giles. uh, will you do me a favor and, and drop dawn off at school, and tell her i'll meet her at the magic shop in an hour when she gets off?
riley: of course, whatever you need me to do.
scene direction: riley buffy starts to leave
riley: buffy!
scene direction: riley she stops
riley: what do you want me to tell dawn ... about your mom?
scene direction: they both look at dawn, still sleeping in the chair with riley's jacket over her.
buffy: tell her we don't know anything yet.
scene direction: riley nods. buffy turns and leaves.
scene change: cut to magic shop. anya is looking through a pile of receipts. we see xander in the background. suddenly anya stops and stares at a receipt.
anya: hey.
scene direction: anya louder
anya: hey!
scene direction: anya shouting
anya: hey!
scene direction: xander turns to look at her. anya holds up the receipt and waves it as giles, willow and tara come rushing over. giles wears a large false smile.
anya: hey!
giles: anya, your heys are startling the customers.
xander: and-and pretty much the state.
anya: you sold someone a khul's amulet and a sobekian bloodstone.
giles: yes, i believe i did.
scene direction: giles takes receipt and examines it
anya: are you stupid or something?
giles: allow me to answer that question with a firing.
xander: she's kidding!
scene direction: xander to anya
xander: an, we talked about the employee-employer vocabulary no-nos. that was number five.
scene direction: anya grabs receipt back from giles
anya: you never sell these things together, ever! bad news! don't you know about the sobekites?
willow: oh! i do. it was an ancient egyptian cult, heavy into dark magic.
scene direction: willow anya nods
tara: and the khul's amulet, wasn't that a transmogrification conduit?
anya: damn straight!
giles: be that as it may, i still see no reason for concern. i mean, the-the sobekian transmogrification spells were lost thousands of years ago. and besides, the young woman to whom i sold them would have to have had enormous power-
scene direction: giles stops suddenly.
scene direction: willow quietly
willow: young woman?
giles: oh, dear lord.
scene direction: everyone looks alarmed except xander, who looks confused.
xander: what?
scene change: cut to a carousel whirling around, brightly lit, playing cheerful music. pan down to riley and dawn sitting on a bench in front of it. dawn is holding an ice-cream float, poking at it with her spoon, distracted.
riley: you're melting.
dawn: oh, um ... guess i'm not hungry.
riley: maybe i'm not making this any better.
dawn: no, i just ... this is better.
scene direction: dawn they smile nervously at each other and are quiet for a moment.
dawn: i had my tenth birthday party here.
riley: really?
dawn: mm-hmm. we'd just moved to sunnydale, and ... mom rented the carousel for an entire hour for just me and my friends.
scene direction: dawn pauses
dawn: except i hadn't made any friends yet, so ... it was just me and mom and buffy riding it by ourselves, over and over and over again...
scene direction: dawn riley smiles
dawn: for the whole hour, just so mom felt like we'd gotten our money's worth.
scene direction: dawn pause, then dawn speaks with her voice breaking
dawn: she's ... she's not gonna get better, is she?
scene direction: riley leans toward her
riley: absolutely she will. summers women are tough.
scene direction: dawn smiles.
dawn: i'm really glad you're here.
riley: thanks.
dawn: buffy's glad too.
scene direction: riley smiles skeptically
riley: yeah?
dawn: she sure cries a lot less with you than she did with angel.
scene direction: riley surprised
riley: angel ... made her cry a lot, huh?
dawn: everything with him was all ...
scene direction: dawn grimaces, makes claw motions with hands
dawn: eee, you know?
riley: all...?
dawn: you know ... "my boyfriend's a vampire" crazy crazy.
scene direction: dawn riley nods
dawn: every day was like the end of the world. she doesn't get all worked up like that over you.
scene direction: riley looks stung, but tries not to show it. dawn realizes she didn't say the right thing.
dawn: i think you've been really good for her.
scene direction: she smiles encouragingly. riley tries to return her smile, but he doesn't really feel it.
scene change: cut to magic shop.
buffy: so i figured there has to be some kind of mystical cure, right? i mean, like a, a potion, or a spell or something. we have to look.
scene direction: during this speech the camera pans around the table showing us anya, xander, tara, buffy, and willow sitting, and giles standing, leaning with his hands on the table.
willow: we can look ... i mean, we will, but ... i haven't seen anything.
giles: the truth is, uh, the ... mystical and the medical aren't meant to mix, buffy. sorry, um ... .the human mind is very delicate. too much can go wrong.
tara: yeah, i've heard stories about people trying healing spells ... if we did something, it could make things a lot worse, buffy.
anya: we've done just about enough making things worse for one day, haven't we?
scene direction: everyone looks guilty except buffy, who looks confused.
buffy: why? what do you mean?
xander: uh, nothing. anya broke a ... bippity boppity boo. a thing. don't worry about it.
anya: i did not! i didn't break-
giles: anya, buffy doesn't need to hear about your ... clumsiness right now.
scene direction: anya sighs
anya: my clumsiness. i mean, that is so-
scene direction: anya willow and xander give her meaningful looks. she looks at buffy
anya: ...like ... me. slippery, slippery ... butterfingers.
scene direction: buffy not fooled
buffy: what happened?
giles: nothing to concern you, uh-
buffy: giles!
scene direction: giles sighs
giles: the, uh,
scene direction: giles embarrassed
giles: demon woman was here, the one who attacked you.
scene direction: buffy looks alarmed.
willow: it's no biggie, she-she just got an amulet and a bloodstone.
anya: that can create a monster.
willow: okay, biggie.
buffy: my god, are you guys okay though? i mean, did - no one got hurt, right?
giles: oh no, thankfully, no, uh, no violence to speak of.
buffy: okay, so, that's good ...
scene direction: buffy not understanding why everyone looks guilty
buffy: how did she get away with this bad mojo stuff?
scene direction: pause. the others look at each other in embarrassment.
scene direction: anya whispering
anya: giles sold it to her.
scene direction: anya buffy looks at giles accusingly
scene direction: giles defensive
giles: i, i, i... i didn't know it was her! i mean, how could i?
scene direction: giles sighs
giles: if it's any consolation, i may have overcharged her.
tara: anya figured out what the demon lady's up to.
anya: yeah, a few thousand years ago there was this cult, the temple of sobek.
buffy: sobek.
anya: reptile demon. sobekites were reptile worshippers.
xander: just once i would like to run into a cult of bunny worshippers.
scene direction: anya angrily
anya: great. thank you very much for those nightmares.
xander: sorry.
anya: anyway, their high priest khul had great mystic powers. he, um, forged an amulet with transmogrifying crystal.
willow: transmogrifying is changing a living thing into a different kind of thing.
giles: we've managed to decipher the markings that were on the bloodstone that i sold - that she left with. um, cobra. she's going to transmogrify a cobra.
buffy: okay, so she's making a monster. what for? what does it do?
giles: that's the part ...
scene direction: giles clears throat
giles: we're working on it.
buffy: well, you keep working on it i'll go kill it.
scene direction: buffy gets up to leave
giles: buffy?
scene direction: buffy turns back
buffy: what? i'm going.
xander: buffy, this chick creamed you last time.
buffy: that's because i wasn't ready for her last time. i am now.
willow: but you-
buffy: but what? will, i can't just sit here. i have to do something.
scene direction: she leaves.
scene change: cut to exterior shot of the sunnydale zoo, day.
scene change: cut to inside the reptile building. pan across a sign explaining the characteristics of the cobra. we see a cobra case with the snake inside. pan back across to glory looking at the case. she punches a fist through the glass, reaches in and grabs the snake. she holds it up to her face, smiling. the snake hisses. glory hisses back(?). the snake's tail lashes angrily.
glory: chill, worm. i'm gonna make you a star!
scene direction: glory laughs. we see dreg watching, smiling.

glory: chant!
scene direction: dreg opens the scroll and begins to chant in a foreign language. titles at the bottom of the screen translate.
dreg: the form is vessel, rendered new. the base is stone, bathed in blood. the gem is fire and elements rarified...
scene direction: glory speaks english
glory: sobek, grant the power ...
scene direction: glory dreg continues chanting
glory: that it may mold this wretched creature ... that it may be reborn ... that it may serve ...
scene direction: glory irritated

scene direction: glory flings buffy backward against another wall. she slides down to sit on the floor.
glory: there!
scene direction: glory grabs buffy's hair and knees her in the face
glory: that feels more real, don't you think?
scene direction: glory pulls buffy up and flings her against another wall. buffy lands upside down and stares, gasping, as glory approaches. she grabs buffy by the throat and lifts her up again.
glory: even if i do have to carry your performance.
scene direction: she throws buffy across the room. buffy crashes through the glass into the snake case.
scene direction: glory throws up her arms
glory: scene!
dreg: cir hayyan win-hud!
scene direction: glory walking toward the vase
glory: arise.
scene direction: glory louder
glory: arise.
dreg: cir hayyan win-hud!
scene direction: glory annoyed
glory: arise!
scene direction: the vase rocks wildly back and forth. suddenly it explodes as the creature bursts out of it. it looks like a very large snake, but with arms. it hisses and sways back and forth.
dreg: he is arisen!
glory: 'bout damn time!
scene direction: glory smiles. blackout.
scene change: *** act iii ***
scene direction: fade in on the reptile house. dreg and glory watch the creature arising. buffy picks herself up and climbs out of the cage, unnoticed.
glory: spawn of sobek!
scene direction: the creature turns toward her and approaches. she smiles and puts her hands on its face.
glory: the power is yours ...
scene direction: glory we see buffy leaving
glory: to see what is unseen. to find what is shrouded in shadow. already, you know what i seek. i have given you form, now find for me the key. seek it out in the holy places.
scene direction: glory the creature hisses
glory: yes, yes, yes! let your vision guide you to its hiding place, and then return to me and tell me where it lies.
scene direction: her smile fades as the creature continues to stare at her.
glory: now would be good.

xander: that creepy demon woman's conjuring some kind of monster.
riley: and you let buffy go after her? alone?
giles: uh, "let" isn't really a factor when she sets her mind to something, you know that.
scene direction: giles he sees a customer approaching the counter and hurries off.
scene direction: riley to xander
riley: she'll get herself killed. it's crazy.
xander: yeah. crazy. going off alone, half-cocked, instead of waiting for much-needed backup ... charging in with a big old hand grenade ... oh, wait.
scene direction: riley looks a little guilty.
riley: this is different.
xander: yeah, it is. buffy needs something she can fight, something she can solve. i don't know what kind of action you're looking for ...
scene direction: xander looks closer at riley
xander: do you?
scene direction: riley stares at him, then looks away.

willow: tara and i did a mini-patrol earlier, but biggie snake was nowhere to be-
scene direction: suddenly the snake creature bursts in through the display window. everyone turns as it slithers inside and rears up, looking at them. dawn is in the forefront. the snake smacks a display case with one arm and it topples over onto buffy, knocking her to the floor. the snake moves toward dawn, who screams continuously as it looms over her. its eyes glow red again. dawn continues screaming as buffy struggles to get out from under the case, and the snake stares at dawn. then it turns and slithers quickly back out the way it came in. blackout.
scene change: *** act iv ***

scene direction: shot of the snake moving down an alley with buffy running after it. buffy turns as giles' convertible comes around the corner and screeches to a stop beside her. she jumps in and giles burns rubber after the creature. as they round a corner, the creature uses its tail to shove a dumpster out into the car's path. giles swerves to avoid it and crashes into a pile of garbage bags. giles struggles to shift into reverse.
buffy: i've gotta stop this monster before it gets back to glory.
giles: glory?
buffy: that's what he called her. giles, she's gonna know dawn's the key if we don't-
giles: we will.

scene change: cut to the snake slithering down darkened streets with giles' car in pursuit. they careen around a corner and nearly slam into another car. the snake tears down a section of fence that's covered with a tarp, and moves off past it as giles' car passes the fence with a screech of tires. giles reverses back into view, and buffy leaps out of the car and runs through the broken fence, past picnic tables, across a wide expanse of grass.
scene direction: we see buffy running across the grass after the snake; she seems to be tiring. the creature knocks over a sign reading "bike path, closed after dusk." buffy pauses to grab a piece of chain from another section of fence as the snake flees into a more wooded area. buffy leaps up onto a large rock as the snake passes around it. she leaps off the rock and lands on the snake's back, looping the chain around its neck. the snake rears up and thrashes, trying to throw her off, but she holds on, tightening the chain around its neck and riding it like a wild horse. it bucks and fights but finally goes still as a gray film comes down over its eyes. buffy frowns and lets go of the chain, which drops to the ground.
scene direction: suddenly the gray film slides aside and the snake rears up again, throwing buffy off. she flies backward and lands on her back in the grass. the snake turns to growl at her as she gets up. she punches it in the face, making it reel backward. she climbs on top of it and begins punching it in the face, over and over. we see the tip of its tail thrashing and finally lying still as the creature dies. buffy continues to punch it, grunting with each blow.
scene direction: long shot of buffy crouching over the dead creature and still steadily punching it. pan up across lawn and trees, and we see the apartment building looming up behind the trees.
