scene direction: the bronze at night. cut inside to xander and willow sitting at a table.
xander: you know how i feel about you. it's, uh, pretty obvious, isn't it? there's never been anyone else for me... but you. and we're good friends, and it's time to take the next step.
scene direction: willow is listening to him dreamily.
xander: would you, um... date me? oh that's good! date me! it's terrible, right?
scene direction: willow comes back to earth
willow: huh? oh, no! oh, yes, 'date me' is silly...
xander: see, what i should do is i should just start with talking about the dance.
scene direction: xander clears his throat
xander: y'know, buffy, spring fling just isn't any dance. it's a time for students to choose, um... a mate and then we can... observe their... mating rituals and tag them before they migrate. just kill me!
willow: you're doing fine!
xander: why's it so hard? i should just walk up to her and say, 'hey, i like you. let's go to the dance together.' willow: direct and to the point.
xander: i'm ready. i wanna do it now. i *gotta* do it now.
willow: oh, buffy's not here. you can practice on me some more.
xander: no, no, i can't wait until tomorrow, i-i'll be thinking about it too much. why didn't buffy show up tonight? what's she doing?
willow: oh, you know, the usual.
scene change: cut to the park. a car is parked in the distance with its windows all fogged up. buffy comes falling into the field of view in slow motion and hits the ground hard on her back and exhales. cut inside the car.
scene direction: cordelia breaks off her kiss with kevin.
cordelia: what was that?
kevin: what was what?
scene direction: cut outside. buffy props herself up. a vampire approaches her and growls. cut inside the car.
cordelia: someone's out there.
kevin: that's silly! who would be out there?
scene direction: cut outside. buffy rolls in a reverse somersault and comes up standing, ready to fight. the vampire growls at her. she pulls a stake out from under her jacket behind her back and holds it pointing out from her hips so the vampire can see. he frowns at the sight of it as buffy puts on an evil smile. this infuriates the vampire and he launches himself at her.
scene direction: she hits him with an out-to-in crescent kick, and then follows up with a high front snap kick, stunning him. she immediately plunges the stake home, and he falls over backward and bursts into ashes when he hits the ground.
buffy: three in one night. giles would be so proud.
scene change: cut to the roof of the library. the camera pans over to the skylight and looks in. giles is at the table researching. he gets up and goes into his office to make some tea. cut to giles' office. he sits down at his desk with his cup of tea and reads the text of the codex.
giles: ho korias phanaytie toutay... tay nuktee. 'the master shall rise...' yes, yes, this is it! 'the master shall rise, and the slayer...'
scene direction: giles looks up in disbelief
giles: my god!
scene direction: he considers what he's just read for a moment and then reaches for his tea. the cup begins to jiggle, and he looks at it curiously. a few seconds later the whole building begins to shake, and he realizes he's experiencing his first earthquake. he gets up and looks around at everything shaking. his teacup vibrates off of the desk and smashes to pieces on the floor.
scene change: cut to the bronze. the people panic. xander grabs willow and guides her away.
xander: under the stairs! under the stairs!
scene direction: they get under the stairs, and willow grabs onto a step from underneath to steady herself. someone rushing down the stairs nearly steps on her fingers, and she yelps as she pulls her hand back.
scene change: cut to cordelia's car. she and kevin hold on as they ride out the quake.
scene direction: cut outside. buffy looks around her at the shaking trees. car alarms are going off everywhere.
scene change: cut to the library. giles comes out of his office and sees several bookshelves fall over as the walls and the floor sustain severe damage.
scene change: cut to the master's lair. he stands with his arms stretched out above him.
master: yes! yes! shake, earth! this is a sign! we are in the final days! my time has come! glory! glory!
scene direction: the quake is over as quickly as it started. the master looks over at collin.
master: whadaya think? 5.1?
scene direction: opening credits roll. buffy's theme plays.
scene change: *** part 1 ***
scene direction: the library. giles comes out of his office and walks over to the cage.
scene direction: buffy comes in.
buffy: morning!
scene direction: she looks around at all the damage. giles looks at her like he's just seen a ghost.
buffy: wow. the damage looks fairly structural. are we safe in here?
giles: buffy!
buffy: what? do i have something on my face?
scene direction: buffy pats her face
giles: no! uh, and, and yes, we're, we're safe.
scene direction: giles indicates the stacks
giles: uh, but probably best not to go up there.
buffy: how're you doin' there, giles? get much sleep last night?
giles: um... i-i-i've been working.
buffy: me, too. i went hunting last night, and it is awfully sweet of you to ask. it's getting hairy out there, giles. i killed three vampires last night, and one of them was practically on school grounds.
giles: their numbers are increasing.
buffy: and they're getting cockier. look, i'm not loving it. last night was a pretty close call.
scene direction: giles distracted
giles: yes.
buffy: giles, care? i'm putting my life on the line battling the undead. look, i broke a nail, okay? i'm wearing a press-on. the least you could do is exhibit some casual interest. you could go, 'hmm'.
scene direction: giles still distracted
giles: hmm? oh, sorry. um, yes, i'm very glad that you're alright. uh, i-i need to verify, um... i just can't really talk right now.
buffy: fine. that's okay. i can't put it off any longer. i have to meet my terrible fate.
scene direction: giles turns around quickly
giles: what?!
buffy: biology.
scene direction: the bell rings as buffy leaves the library to go to class. giles watches her go.
scene direction: cut outside after class. buffy, xander and willow come out of the doors onto the balcony and head down the stairs.
scene direction: buffy exhales
buffy: wow. that was boring.
xander: i don't feel that boring covers it.
buffy: no, boring falls short.
willow: even i was bored. and i'm a science nerd.
buffy: don't say that.
willow: i'm not ashamed. it's the computer age. nerds are in. they're still in, right?
xander: willow, don't you have a thing?
willow: a thing?
scene direction: willow remembers
willow: the thing! that i have! which is... a thing that i have to go to.
scene direction: they reach the bottom of the stairs.
willow: see ya later.
scene direction: willow waves and departs
buffy: what on earth is her deal?
xander: uh, she's willow.
scene direction: xander laughs
xander: so, uh, buffy, i wanted to, um... there was this thing i wanted to ask you, to talk to you about.
buffy: okay, what's up?
xander: uh, let's go over here and sit.
scene direction: he leads her over to a bench.
buffy: okay, now you're making me nervous.
xander: oh, no, no, there's nothing to be nervous about. really, it's silly. ha, ha!
scene direction: xander laughs nervously
scene direction: they reach the bench, but a boy is sitting there.
scene direction: xander to the boy
xander: hey.
scene direction: xander the boy looks up
xander: leave.
scene direction: xander the boy leaves
xander: thanks.
scene direction: xander they sit
buffy: well?
xander: um... you know, buffy, uh, spring fling is a... time for students to gather and... oh, god!
scene direction: xander takes a breath
xander: buffy, i want you to go to the dance with me. you and me, on a date.
scene direction: buffy speechless
buffy: i-i don't know what to say.
xander: well, you're not laughing. so that's a good start. buffy, i like you. a lot. and i know we're friends, and we've had experiences... we've fought some blood-sucking fiends, and that's all been a good time. but i want more. i wanna dance with you.
buffy: xander, you're one of my best friends. you and willow...
xander: well, willow's not looking to date you. or if she is, she's playing it pretty close to the chest.
scene direction: xander laughs nervously
buffy: i don't want to spoil the friendship that we have.
xander: well, i don't want to spoil it either. but that's not the point, is it? you either feel a thing or you don't.
scene direction: buffy looks down a moment, then back up
buffy: i don't. xander, i'm, i'm sorry. i-i just don't think of you that way.
xander: well, try. i'll wait.
scene direction: xander smiles weakly
buffy: xander...
xander: nah. forget it.
scene direction: xander gets up
xander: i'm not him. i mean, i guess a guy's gotta be undead to make time with you.
buffy: that's really harsh.
xander: look, i'm sorry. i don't handle rejection well. funny! considering all the practice i've had, huh?
buffy: xander, i'm sorry, i don't know...
xander: you know what? let's just not.
scene direction: he goes into the building with his head hung low. buffy exhales, bummed.
scene direction: she turns and watches him leave.
scene change: cut to the library. giles is on the phone.
giles: hello. uh, this is giles. uh... uh, rupert giles.
scene direction: ms. calendar walks in and stands by his office door.
scene direction: giles into the phone
giles: i-i need to see you. no, i-i realize that. uh... come after sundown. good. i'll see you then.
scene direction: giles hangs up
ms. calendar: you know, that outfit looks just like the one you wore yesterday. only wrinklier. were you here all night?
giles: sorry, uh... i'm not really up to, uh, socializing just now.
ms. calendar: something's going on, rupert, and i'm guessing you already know what it is.
scene direction: giles turns around and gets up
giles: what do you know?
ms. calendar: well, i have been surfing the 'net, looking for unexplained incidents. you know, people are always sending stuff my way. they know the occult's my turf. now, here is the latest. a cat last week gave birth to a litter of snakes. a family was swimming in whisper lake when the lake suddenly began to boil. and mercy hospital last night, a boy was born with his eyes facing inward. i'm not stupid. this is apocalypse stuff. and throw in last night's earthquake, and i'd say we've got a problem. i would say the end is pretty seriously nigh.
giles: i don't know if i can trust you.
ms. calendar: i helped you cast that demon out of the internet. i think that merits some trust. look, i'm scared, okay? oh, plus, i've got this, this crazy monk e-mailing me from cortona about some anointed one?
giles: the anointed one? he's dead!
ms. calendar: someone's dead?
giles: uh, who is this monk?
ms. calendar: uh, a brother luca something? keeps sending out global mailings about a prophecy.
giles: i need you to talk to him, find out everything he knows.
ms. calendar: look, rupert, you haven't told me jack, so what's with the order?
giles: just do it! i'll e-explain later.
ms. calendar: you better.
scene change: cut to the halls.
kevin: i'll get everything tonight after practice. the guys'll help me.
cordelia: well, it's all in the a-v room. the sound system, and the decorations... and, oh, aura needs help, um, moving the coolers.
kevin: don't sweat it!
cordelia: well, bring everything to the bronze, and i'll meet you there in the morning!
kevin: done!
scene direction: cordelia giggles
cordelia: you're so sweet! why're you so sweet?
kevin: i dunno! 'cause i'm usually mean as a snake!
scene direction: she smiles at him. she spots willow.
cordelia: willow!
scene direction: cordelia to kevin
cordelia: i'll see you in the morning.
kevin: okay.
scene direction: kevin leaves
cordelia: willow! i really like your outfit!
willow: no, you don't.
cordelia: no, i really don't, but i need a favor.
willow: what kind?
cordelia: well, the bronze won't let us use their sound system, and i need someone who knows how to hook one up. if you could just show up tomorrow morning...
scene direction: willow sees xander throwing a ball against the wall in a classroom.
cordelia: ...i'd be really, really grateful! i mean, i'd talk to you at the dance and everything.
willow: sure.
scene direction: willow looks back at xander
cordelia: great! tomorrow at ten?
willow: sure.
scene direction: she goes over to xander in the room.
willow: hey!
xander: hey!
scene direction: xander throws the ball
willow: how'd it go?
scene direction: xander throws the ball
xander: on a scale of one to ten? it sucked.
scene direction: xander throws the ball
willow: oh.
xander: well, i guess it could be worse.
scene direction: xander throws the ball
xander: i could have gangrene on my face.
scene direction: xander throws the ball
willow: well, what'd she say?
xander: apart from 'no', does it really matter? she's still jonesin' for angel, and could care less about me.
willow: at least now you know.
xander: yeah, you're right. the deal's done. the polls are in, and it's time for my concession speech.
scene direction: xander has an idea and brightens
xander: hey, i know what we'll do! we can go! be my date! we'll, we'll have a great time! we'll dance, we'll go wild... whadaya say?
willow: no.
xander: good! what?
willow: there's no way.
scene direction: xander exhales
xander: willow, come on!
willow: you think i wanna go to the dance with you and watch you wish you were at the dance with her? you think that's my idea of hijinks? you should know better.
scene direction: xander exhales
xander: i didn't think.
willow: i'm sorry it didn't work out for you. i'll see you on monday.
scene direction: willow leaves
xander: that's okay. i don't wanna go. i'm just gonna go home, lie down and listen to country music. the music of pain.
scene direction: he throws the ball again and lets it bounce wild.
scene change: cut outside the school at night. cut to the girls' locker room. buffy shuts her gym locker. two girls walk by chatting. buffy plays with a stake as she heads to the sinks and puts it down on one. she looks at herself in the mirror and absently turns on the water. after looking in the mirror another moment she looks down and sees that blood is pouring from the faucet.
scene change: cut to the library. buffy comes in.
scene direction: buffy to herself
buffy: giles, you are not gonna believe this.
scene direction: she stops when she hears giles talking and looks into his office.
giles: it's clear. it's what's gonna happen. uh, it's happening now!
scene direction: angel moves into the light to read the codex, and buffy sees him.
buffy: angel?
scene direction: she heads toward the office.
angel: it can't be. you've gotta be wrong.
giles: i've checked it against all my other volumes. it's very real.
scene direction: buffy stops at the door.
angel: well, there's gotta be some way around it.
giles: listen. some prophecies are, are a bit dodgy. they're, they're mutable. buffy herself has, has thwarted them time and time again, but this is the codex. there is nothing in it that does not come to pass.
angel: then you're reading it wrong.
giles: i wish to god i were! but it's very plain! tomorrow night buffy will face the master, and she will die.
scene direction: buffy is stunned.
scene change: *** part 2 ***
scene direction: giles' office.
angel: well, have you verified the text?
scene direction: buffy begins to laugh. angel and giles see her and exchange a look. she slowly starts to walk away from the office door. angel comes out of the office after her. she stops by the table and faces them. giles stands in his office doorway.
buffy: so that's it, huh? i remember the drill. one slayer dies, next one's called! wonder who she is.
scene direction: buffy to giles
buffy: will you train her? or will they send someone else?
giles: buffy, i...
buffy: they say how he's gonna kill me? do you think it'll hurt?
scene direction: tears are flowing freely from her eyes. angel tries to hug her, but she puts up her hands and quickly steps away.
buffy: don't touch me!
scene direction: buffy to giles
buffy: were you even gonna tell me?
giles: i was hoping that i wouldn't have to. that there was... some way around it. i...
buffy: i've got a way around it. i quit!
angel: it's not that simple.
buffy: i'm making it that simple! i quit! i resign, i-i'm fired, you can find someone else to stop the master from taking over!
giles: i'm not sure that anyone else can. all the... the signs indicate...
buffy: the signs?
scene direction: buffy throws a book at him
buffy: read me the signs!
scene direction: buffy throws another one
buffy: tell me my fortune! you're so useful sitting here with all your books! you're really a lotta help!
giles: no, i don't suppose i am.
angel: i know this is hard.
buffy: what do you know about this? you're never gonna die!
angel: you think i want anything to happen to you? do you think i could stand it? we just gotta figure out a way...
buffy: i already did. i quit, remember? pay attention!
giles: buffy, if the master rises...
scene direction: buffy yanks the cross from her neck
buffy: i don't care!
scene direction: buffy calms down
buffy: i don't care. giles, i'm sixteen years old. i don't wanna die.
scene direction: giles is at a loss. buffy throws her cross down. angel doesn't know what to say either. she walks out of the library without looking back.
scene change: cut to willow's room. she's at her desk studying. she looks up at a picture of her and xander and sighs. she picks up the phone and dials his number. cut to xander's room. "i fall to pieces", by patsy cline, is playing on the radio.
lyrics: i fall to pieces.
scene direction: the phone rings. xander lifts it off the hook, lets it drop back on the hook and then takes it off the hook completely.
lyrics: each time i see you again.
scene change: cut to buffy's room. she's looking through a photo album. jonatha brooke's "inconsolable" is playing on the radio. her mother comes in.
lyrics: i never knew what enough was.
joyce: hi, honey. you alright?
lyrics: until i'd had more than my share buffy: sure.
joyce: probably just full from that bite of dinner you nearly had.
lyrics: i let the darkness in.
joyce: feel like telling me what's on your mind?
lyrics: and it was then i lost the dare.
scene direction: buffy turns to her mom
buffy: mom, let's go away!
scene direction: buffy smiles
joyce: what?
buffy: anywhere, just for a while, all weekend!
joyce: honey, i...
buffy: no, it'll be great! you and me, a mother-daughter thing... we can talk about all the embarrassing things you love to bring up.
joyce: you know the gallery's open on weekends.
buffy: mom, please!
joyce: isn't the prom tomorrow night? or spring fling, whatever they're calling it?
buffy: i-i guess.
joyce: nobody asked you?
buffy: oh, someone...
joyce: but not the right someone. see, sometimes i actually do know what you're thinking.
scene direction: joyce goes over to buffy's closet
joyce: well, then, uh, this probably isn't the best time for this, but, uh...
scene direction: she opens the closet to reveal a beautiful white sleeveless gown.
joyce: i saw you eyeing it at the store. i figured...
scene direction: buffy gets up
buffy: mom, we can't afford this.
joyce: the way you've been eating, we can afford it.
scene direction: buffy comes over to look at it
buffy: it's beautiful.
joyce: i think you should wear it. to the dance.
buffy: no, i-i can't go to the dance.
joyce: says who? is it written somewhere? you should do what you want. homecoming, my freshman year of college. i didn't have a date, so i got dressed up and i went anyway.
buffy: was it awful?
joyce: it was awful. for about an hour.
buffy: then what happened?
scene direction: joyce smiles
joyce: i met your father.
buffy: he didn't have a date either?
joyce: he did. and that's a much funnier story that you will *not* get to hear. oh, but it was a beautiful night!
scene direction: joyce exhales
buffy: and you had your whole life ahead of you.
joyce: yeah.
buffy: must be nice.
scene change: cut to the school the next day. cut inside to the halls. cordelia and willow are coming down the stairs.
cordelia: oh, kevin said that he'd bring everything to the bronze last night. he promised! we'll never get everything ready in time.
willow: he probably forgot. it's not *that* big a deal.
cordelia: uh, you don't understand. i'm not mad! he totally flaked on me. on me! and i don't even care. god help me, i think it's cute! oh...
scene direction: willow smiles. they reach the audio-visual room. they see kevin and his friends through the windows.
cordelia: there they are! they're watching cartoons. that's so cu... that's not cute. that's annoying. i'm annoyed.
willow: right. i'm furious.
cordelia: men. i don't know why we put up with them.
willow: i hear ya.
scene change: cut to a view of the door from inside the room. kevin is sitting on the floor leaning against it. the room is trashed and the boys are all dead.
cordelia: obviously, kevin has underestimated the power of my icy stare.
scene direction: she opens the door, and kevin's body falls out into the hall. he has a vampire bite on his neck.
scene direction: cordelia screams
cordelia: oh, my god! kevin!
scene direction: cordelia kneels by him
cordelia: no!
scene direction: willow looks up and slowly goes into the room. she sees the death and devastation.
cordelia: kevin!
scene direction: there's a bloody handprint on the tv screen.
scene change: cut to buffy's room. she's wearing her new white prom gown, and is looking at herself in the mirror. her mom comes rushing in.
joyce: buffy?! there's something on the news. willow.
scene change: cut to a view of the sunset.
willow: i've seen so much.
scene change: cut to her room. she's on the bed hugging her knees. she's been crying.
willow: i thought i could take anything. but, buffy, this... this was different.
buffy: it'll be alright.
willow: i'm trying to think how to say it... to explain it so you understand.
buffy: it doesn't matter as long as you're okay.
willow: i'm not okay. i knew those guys. i go to that room every day. and when i walked in there, it... it wasn't our world anymore. they made it theirs. and they had fun.
scene direction: willow a tear rolls down her cheek
willow: what are we gonna do?
buffy: what we have to.
scene direction: buffy gets up and exhales
buffy: promise me you'll stay in tonight, okay?
scene direction: willow nods. buffy starts to go.
willow: buffy?
scene direction: buffy stops and turns back.
scene direction: willow smiles through her tears
willow: i like your dress.
scene direction: buffy looks down at it and smiles weakly, then looks back up.
buffy: take care.
scene direction: buffy leaves
scene direction: willow looks down sadly and stays on her bed.
scene change: cut to the master's lair. he tests his confines as collin watches.
master: soon.
scene direction: he sends collin on his way to get buffy. collin climbs up to the exit.
master: soon!
scene change: cut to the library. giles is getting weapons out of the cage and prepares them.
ms. calendar: okay, so this master guy tried to open the hellmouth. but he got stuck in it, and now all the signs are reading that he's gonna get out, which opens the hellmouth, which brings the demons, which ends the world.
giles: yes. that about sums it up, yes.
ms. calendar: the part that gets me, though, is where buffy is the vampire slayer. she's so little.
giles: you know how to get in touch with this, uh, brother luca chap?
ms. calendar: hmm. as far as i can tell, no one can. he's disappeared.
scene direction: did send out one last global though. a short one.
giles: what did it say?
ms. calendar: isaiah 11:6, which i dutifully looked up.
giles: 'the wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf, the lion and the fatling together, and the little child to lead them.' ms. calendar: that's kinda warm and fuzzy for a message of doom.
giles: well, that depends where he's leading them to. aurelius wrote of the anointed one, 'the slayer will not know him, and he will lead her into hell.' ms. calendar: so luca thinks the anointed is a kid.
giles: if the vampire that buffy killed was in fact not the anointed, then it may well be.
ms. calendar: well, then we need to warn her.
giles: i don't intend involving her at all.
ms. calendar: what do you mean?
giles: buffy's not gonna face the master. i am.
buffy: no, you're not.
scene direction: giles and ms. calendar look over and see her approaching.
buffy: so, i'm looking for a kid, huh? and he'll lead me to the master?
giles: buffy, i'm not gonna send you out there to die. now, you were right. i-i've waded around in these old books for so long, i've forgotten what the real world is like. i-it's time i found out.
buffy: you're still not going up against the master.
giles: i've made up my mind.
buffy: so have i.
giles: i made up my mine first! i'm older and wiser than you, and just... just do what you're told for once! alright?
buffy: that's not how it goes. i'm the slayer.
giles: i don't care what the books say. i defy prophecy, and i am going. there's nothing you can say will change my mind.
buffy: i know.
scene direction: she pretends to turn to go, but then throws a hard punch to his face, knocking him out. he falls backward to the floor. ms. calendar scrambles to his aid. buffy sees her cross on the table and puts it back on. ms.
scene direction: calendar lifts giles' head in her hands and gets under it with her knees. she looks up at buffy.
buffy: when he wakes up tell him... i don't know. think of something cool, tell him i said it.
ms. calendar: you fight the master, and you'll die.
buffy: maybe.
scene direction: buffy picks up the crossbow
buffy: maybe i'll take him with me.
scene direction: she leaves the library. ms. calendar turns her attention to giles.
scene direction: cut outside the school. buffy walks a short distance, looking all around, when she comes upon collin.
collin: help me...
scene direction: she lowers the crossbow and walks over to him.
buffy: it's okay. i know who you are.
scene direction: collin holds out his hand. she takes it, and he starts to lead her away to the master.
scene change: *** part 3 ***
scene direction: the library. willow and xander are there, and have found out that buffy has gone to fight the master.
xander: she what?
willow: i told you there was something going on with her.
xander: and she knew about this prophecy of yours?
scene direction: xander giles nods
xander: aw, man, what do we do?
giles: we stay calm, first thing.
xander: calm?
willow: i think he's right.
xander: i'm sorry, calm may work for locutus of the borg here,
scene direction: xander indicates giles
xander: but i'm freaked out, and i intend to stay that way.
willow: xander...
xander: how could you let her go?
giles: as the soon-to-be-purple area of my jaw will attest, i did *not*
scene direction: *let* her go!
willow: well, how can we help her?
ms. calendar: uh, i'm sorry to bring this up, but we also have an apocalypse to worry about?
xander: do you mind?
willow: how come she's in the club?
ms. calendar: hey! once the master gets free, the hellmouth opens, the demons come to party, and everybody dies.
xander: uh, uh, i don't care. i'm sorry, i don't. right now i gotta help buffy.

xander: look, i know you can find this master guy. he's underground, right? take me to him.

xander: how can i say this clearly?

angel: you're in love with her.
xander: aren't you?
scene change: cut to the library. giles comes out of the stacks with an armful of books.
giles: the master is as old as any vampire on record. there's no telling how powerful he'll be if he reaches the surface.
ms. calendar: okay, here's my question: the hellmouth opens.
giles: yes.
ms. calendar: where? if he's underground, and it's right where he is, where's it gonna open?

scene direction: the master's voice seems to be coming from all directions.
buffy: thanks for having me.
scene direction: the master steps into the light to look at her.
buffy: y'know, you really oughtta talk to your contractor. looks like you got some water damage.
master: oh, good. the feeble banter portion of the fight. why don't we just cut to the...
scene direction: buffy spins around and launches a bolt in the direction of his voice.

angel: no, i wasn't!
xander: just keep your distance, pal.
angel: i wasn't looking at your neck!
xander: i told you to eat before we left.
scene change: cut to the master's lair.
master: you're not going to kill me with that thing.
buffy: don't be so sure.
master: you still don't understand your part in all this, do you? you are not the hunter. you are the lamb.
scene change: cut to the library. giles and ms. calendar are at the table studying their volumes.
giles: well, let's think about this, then. the vampires have been gathering, they know he's coming, they will be his army.
ms. calendar: do you think they'll gather at the hellmouth?
willow: well, the last time the master tried to rise was the harvest. he sent a bunch of vampires to get him fresh blood.
ms. calendar: well, where did that go down?
giles: the bronze.
willow: the prom!
giles: we have to warn them.
scene direction: ms. calendar stops giles
ms. calendar: no! we'll go. you have to concentrate on demon killing. my car's in the lot.

willow: we will.
scene change: cut to the master's lair. buffy is slowly walking around, searching for the master. she comes upon a dead and rotted body. she continues her search.
buffy: you know, for someone who's all powerful, you sure do like to hide.
master: i'm waiting for you. i want this moment to last.
buffy: well, i don't.

scene direction: willow catches up
willow: why not?
ms. calendar: 'cause they're not goin' to the bronze.
scene direction: they look out onto the field and see a hoard of vampires approaching.
scene direction: they look across the parking lot and see more of them. they turn to go back and see even more of them blocking their way. they're surrounded.

scene direction: she looks back at him and can't move. he approaches her, making slow twisting motions with his hand. he comes up behind her, gently takes off her leather jacket and lets it fall to the ground. buffy is panting hard with fear.
master: you tried. it was noble of you. you heard the prophecy that i was about to break free and you came to stop me. but prophecies are tricky creatures. they don't tell you everything.
scene direction: master whispers
master: you're the one that sets me free!
scene direction: master gloats
master: if you hadn't come, i couldn't go.
scene direction: master whispers
master: think about that!
scene direction: buffy is frozen with fear. the master waits a moment longer and then bends down and bites her at the base of her neck. he drinks a few sips and lets her go.
master: oh, god! the power!
scene direction: buffy falls to her knees.
master: and by the way...
scene direction: she falls face down into the pool of water.
master: i like your dress.

scene direction: they break into a run for the master's lair. angel gets there first, looks around and spots buffy. he scrambles down to the floor and rushes to her as xander reaches the lair's entrance. xander stops and stares at buffy in the pool. angel reaches her and quickly pulls her out of the water. he holds her and tries to listen for breathing. nothing. he looks up at xander.

scene direction: xander looks down at them and swallows hard.
scene change: *** part 4 ***
scene direction: the master's lair. xander comes down to angel and buffy.
xander: no. she's not dead.

xander: but if she drowned, uh, there's a shot! cpr!
angel: you have to do it. i have no breath.
scene direction: xander takes off his jacket and lays it over her. he kneels down by her face and looks at her a moment, then puts his mouth on hers and blows into her lungs. he lets go and begins to pump her chest.
xander: c'mon. c'mon!
scene change: cut to the school parking lot. the vampires are advancing on willow and ms. calendar.

xander: c'mon!

xander: buffy!
scene direction: she turns her head to the side and coughs out a bunch of water. xander and angel look at each other and smile. xander puts his hand on buffy's forehead and strokes it gently. she looks up at him, surprised to see him.

ms. calendar: what do we do now?
willow: we've gotta get to the library!
cordelia: library! great!

scene direction: the master turns his head and stares at her in surprise.
master: you're dead!
