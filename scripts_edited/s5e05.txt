scene change: *** prologue ***
scene direction: cut to 1 int. czech republic- monastery- corridor- night 1
scene direction: two monks race down the corridor, panicked, throwing terrified glances behind them. they clutch religious items in their arms - books, candles, incense. one of the monks stumbles, dropping a censer of incense. his companion helps him up and they continue their flight down the candlelit hallway. the monks careen through a set of massive wooden doors and slam them shut. they slide a beam the size of a tree trunk across the doorway.
scene direction: title card - two months ago.
scene direction: cut to 2 int. czech republic- monastery- great hall- night 2
scene direction: as the beam slides home, one of the monks calls fearfully to the other in czech.
scene direction: monk #2 subtitle
monk #2: it's coming. it's going to kill us!
scene direction: monk subtitle
monk: our lives aren't important. we have to protect the key.
scene direction: the two monks race to the center of the great room and join a third senior member of their order. they kneel on the floor before the
scene direction: senior monk, around several lit candles and magick talismans.
scene direction: senior monk subtitle
senior monk: help me perform the ritual.
scene direction: all three monks extend their arms and begin chanting. as they speak the ancient words, a tremendous crash echoes through the monastery and the massive wooden door trembles in its frame. as the junior monks glance fearfully at the door, the elder admonishes them.
scene direction: senior monk subtitle
senior monk: concentrate. concentrate.
scene direction: the ritual resumes and a breeze springs up inside the chamber. the relentless pounding on the door continues; the crossbeam starts to splinter.
scene direction: suddenly, a bright flash of light leaps from the center of their circle. then all goes dark as the door finally gives way and shatters, blasted into the room in pieces.
scene direction: dissolve to 3 ext. sunnydale industrial district- factory lot- night 3
scene direction: fade in on a sign mounted on a chain link fence - private property no trespassing violators will be prosecuted.
scene direction: title card - now.
scene direction: buffy flies into frame and slams against the sign. she ducks just as a vampire's fist smashes into it where her head was an instant before. the vampire is a huge, burly hell's angel biker-type and he looms menacingly over buffy.
biker vampire: i've always wanted to kill the slayer.
buffy: and i've always wanted piano lessons. so really, who's surprised we have all this unexpressed rage?
scene direction: buffy punctuates her words with blow after blow, knocking the hulking vampire back several feet. he retaliates with a brutal punch to her face, sending her reeling. she blocks a second blow and wrenches the demon's arm behind his back and flattens him against the fence.
buffy: but honestly? i think i'm expressing mine better. tell you what... you find yourself a good anger management class...
scene direction: the vampire throws her off but she slams him back into the fence again and whips out a stake.
buffy: and i'll jam this pokey wood stick through your heart.
scene direction: before the vampire can react, buffy stakes him to dust and slips the stake back into her coat.
scene direction: buffy to herself
buffy: i think that sets the world speed record for closure.
scene direction: man o.s.
man: hey!
scene direction: a bright light shines in buffy's eyes as she turns to see the factory
scene direction: night watchman approaching.
night watchman: miss, if you're looking for one of those rave parties, i'm afraid you're late. chased a bunch of kids out of here last night.
scene direction: buffy covers
buffy: oh, right. yeah. darn. my fellow ravers will be so disappointed. it was my turn to bring the bundt cake.
night watchman: you know if it was my call, i'd let you do whatever you want. it's not like anybody's using this place or nothin'. but they just don't pay me enough to argue with the boss so...
buffy: already gone!
scene direction: she turns to leave but the guard stops her.
night watchman: oh, hey! hold it, miss. take your... whatever this is with you.
scene direction: he bends over, picks up a glowing yellow orb and hands it to buffy, who looks at it curiously.
buffy: thank you.
night watchman: glow balls, huh?
scene direction: night watchman laughs
night watchman: i swear, i don't get your generation. what is that thing?
scene direction: buffy distracted
buffy: i'll let you know as soon as i find out.
scene direction: she turns and walks off into the night.
scene direction: opening credit sequence.
scene change: *** act i ***
scene direction: cut to 4 int. summers home- kitchen- day 4.
scene direction: buffy is preparing a breakfast tray for her mother. dawn enters, smiling.
buffy: dawn, touch nothing.
dawn: who died and made you the iron chef?
buffy: look, mom's sick and i made her a nice non-instant breakfast for once. and i don't need you...
scene direction: dawn knocks over the rose vase on the tray.
dawn: oops!
buffy: ...doing that.
scene direction: joyce enters in her bathrobe, smiling.
joyce: oh! check out the "pamper mom" platter.
scene direction: joyce to dawn
joyce: you two do all this?
dawn: oh, buffy helped.
scene direction: buffy can't believe her sister.
buffy: i didn't "help"...
joyce: i'm sure you did.
scene direction: joyce sits down
joyce: so neither of you is pregnant, failing or under indictment?
scene direction: joyce off their looks
joyce: just checking.
buffy: we knew you were feeling less-than-great so...
joyce: yeah, the headaches they said would go away came back and brought some friends along with.
buffy: well, what did the doctor say?
joyce: oh, take four of some-pills a day and come back for tests.
buffy: so they don't know what's wrong?
joyce: not yet.
buffy: well, that's unacceptable. i think we should get a second opinion.
joyce: well, we need a first opinion first, honey.
buffy: okay, we'll go right now.
joyce: buffy, i know you're concerned, okay? but don't be. i'm still the mom. which means i get to worry about you two. which is a good thing because you're a vampire slayer.
scene direction: joyce pulls dawn onto her lap
joyce: and you... you are my little punkin' belly!
scene direction: dawn embarrassed
dawn: oh, mom! that's like my kid name.
joyce: so i can't be retro?
scene direction: buffy notes joyce and dawn's easy camaraderie and feels a little excluded.
buffy: did you ever have any names for me?
joyce: no... i think you were always just buffy.
dawn: i got some names for ya...
scene direction: buffy is hurt but covers. joyce suddenly remembers something.
scene direction: joyce to buffy
joyce: what are you doing hanging around here? isn't this giles' big day?
buffy: oh! bigger than big. it's his grand opening.
joyce: so go. bring me back a... i don't know... a flying broomstick or something.
dawn: those never really work.
joyce: whatever. book club tonight?
dawn: uh-huh.
buffy: you guys have a book club?
scene direction: buffy off their looks
buffy: okay, i'm gonna go. i will be back later.
scene direction: buffy to joyce
buffy: what time is your doctor's appointment?
scene direction: buffy off her exasperated look
buffy: i just want to know... take it easy. i want you to relax all day, keep your feet up, plenty of oprah.
dawn: plus you can check my rain forest report and you know there's like eighty bazillion old board games-.
scene direction: buffy grabs dawn by the arm and drags her out of the house.
dawn: hey! you said i couldn't come.
buffy: changed my mind.
scene direction: cut to 5 int. the magic box- day 5
scene direction: buffy enters and glances up at the quaint bell that rings when she opens the door. she strolls into the store, taking in the curios and knickknacks lining the shelves. the store is quiet and empty. she looks up to find giles standing serenely in the center of the store, dressed in a spangled purple robe and pointed purple warlock's cap. giles smiles at buffy cheerily who merely stares him down. finally, he drops the facade and shrugs out of the costume just as dawn bursts through the door behind buffy, gasping for breath.
scene direction: dawn to buffy
dawn: i told you you couldn't ditch me!
scene direction: dawn looks around
dawn: whoa... mr. giles! this place is so... wow. i mean, check out all the magick junk.
giles: our new slogan...
dawn: so when's it open? you know, for customers?
giles: since nine this morning, actually.
buffy: dawn. go. browse. and-
dawn: "you break it, you bought it." heard you the first sixty times.
scene direction: dawn wanders into the recesses of the store to check the place out.
scene direction: giles to buffy
giles: still, not to worry. no, i've got feelings about this place. magick's a small niche market but... well, think about it. sunnydale... monsters... supply and demand. they'll be lining up around the block in no time.
buffy: yeah. you'll be making money hand over fist.
scene direction: suddenly puzzled, she holds her hand over her fist.
buffy: which i guess is a good thing.
giles: you all right? you seem a little distracted.
buffy: it's just my mom's still sick and we have no idea what the deal is.
giles: she is getting medical attention?
buffy: yeah. we have a highly trained medical staff working 'round the clock to tell us diddly.
giles: i'm sorry. still, you know, time and patience... both great comforts-
scene direction: the bell jingles as willow and riley enter. willow runs in, excited.
willow: giles! where's your hat and cloak?
riley: yeah, the hype was out of control.
scene direction: dawn to willow
dawn: willow! you gotta see this. they have the coolest talismans... mans... talisguys. i-.
scene direction: buffy interrupts
buffy: actually, i have a little scooby-centric deal to deal with first.
scene direction: buffy reaches into her bag and removes the glowing yellow globe.
buffy: i put this before the group. what the hell is it?
giles: it appears to be paranormal in origin.
willow: how can you tell?
giles: well, it's so shiny.
buffy: found it on patrol.
scene direction: she hands the object to giles.
riley: may be more where that came from. i say we go back out again tonight.
buffy: um... sure.
scene direction: dawn to riley
dawn: you can't patrol. buffy said.
buffy: no, i didn't.
dawn: yeah, remember? you said it'd be easier if you didn't have to look out for anybody.
scene direction: buffy nervous
buffy: well, i wasn't talking about riley.
riley: don't worry about it.
dawn: oh, she just said you look even cuter when you're all weak and kitteny and she'd better go solo or you'd get hurt. so welcome to the club. she'll never let me go either.
scene direction: buffy is mortified and furious. giles, willow and riley look away, uncomfortable. dawn finally registers the awkward silence.
dawn: what? what?
riley: giles, you got that danger room set up out back? i'm feeling the need for a little physical rehab about now.
scene direction: giles hands the globe to willow.
scene direction: giles to riley
giles: of course, yes.
scene direction: giles to willow
giles: if any customers do-
willow: on it.
buffy: dawn, we're going.
scene direction: dawn knows she's in trouble and heads out, dejected. willow stops buffy before she leaves.
willow: buffy, wait. go easy on her.
buffy: why?
willow: i can't help it. i just have all this involuntary empathy for dawn. 'cause she's, you know, a big spaz.
scene direction: all of buffy's pent-up frustrations suddenly pour out.
buffy: she's so annoying. especially now that mom's sick. she's all over her while i have to be the grown-up and the two of them are like the giggle twins and why can't i ever be lil punkin' belly?
willow: while i don't feel qualified to address the last part, i can tell you that dawn's not just the youngest, she's the baby and maybe your mom needs that right now.
buffy: dawn doesn't care what my mom...
scene direction: buffy beat
buffy: you just have no idea how much i wish i were an only child these days.
scene direction: the crash of breaking glass comes from the rear of the store.
scene direction: dawn o.s.
dawn: oops!
scene direction: buffy winces and looks knowingly at willow.
scene direction: cut to 6 int. summers home- foyer- day 6
scene direction: buffy and dawn enter, dawn still going on about the incident at the shop.
dawn: we can't all be born with big, fancy, chosen one reflexes, you know.
buffy: shh! mom?
scene direction: a soft moan comes from the living room.
scene direction: cut to 7 int. summers home- living room- day 7
scene direction: buffy and dawn rush to joyce, who is lying on the couch in obvious distress.
buffy: mom!
dawn: what's wrong?
scene direction: joyce weak
joyce: it's just my head.
buffy: i'm taking you to the doctor.
joyce: no, sweetheart. i'm fine.
buffy: we don't know that. we don't know anything. we're going.
joyce: i just need my prescription. please?
scene direction: buffy picks up the slip and stands.
buffy: hospital pharmacy open?
joyce: mmm-hmm.
buffy: ten minutes.
scene direction: she heads out.
scene direction: cut to 8 int. sunnydale hospital- pharmacy counter- day 8.
scene direction: the technician hands buffy a bottle of pills and she turns to leave, examining the bottle as she goes. she passes two orderlies and a nurse wheeling a patient down the corridor on a gurney. ben, the nurse, calls out to buffy, stopping her.
ben: hey! it's buffy, isn't it?
scene direction: she looks at him, confused.
ben: ben... but you can call me man-nurse. everybody else here does.
scene direction: suddenly the patient sits up, struggling to get off the gurney. it's the factory night watchman from the night before.
night watchman: i don't belong here. i have important instructions. fascists!
scene direction: ben pushes him back down while the orderlies fasten his restraints.
ben: now you're hurting the nice orderly who's here to help you.
scene direction: ben to nurse
ben: i need nine cc's of phenobarbital in this guy n-
scene direction: buffy steps up and slams the man down onto the gurney with one arm and effortlessly holds him there.
scene direction: ben amazed
ben: or not.
scene direction: ben to orderlies
ben: now let's strap him.
scene direction: ben to patient
ben: for your own good, i promise.
scene direction: ben to buffy
ben: you know, not to be rampantly sexist in the workplace, but you've got some serious muscles for a girl.
buffy: i... um...
ben: radioactive spider bite.
buffy: how'd you guess?
ben: i'm a doctor- well, almost.
scene direction: the night watchman seizes buffy's arm and looks at the medicine bottle she's holding.
night watchman: doesn't even help. doesn't make a damn bit of difference!
scene direction: buffy to ben
buffy: i've met this guy. he's a security guard. he's not crazy.
ben: if you say so...
scene direction: night watchman to buffy
night watchman: they're coming at you. don't think you're above it, missy. they come through the family! they get to your family!
buffy: my family? what do you mean?
scene direction: he lets go of her arm and the pill bottle falls to the floor.
scene direction: ben to orderlies
ben: let's get him to exam one. now would be nice.
scene direction: buffy stares after him as the orderlies wheel him out. ben picks up buffy's pills and hands them to her.
ben: i'm real sorry about that. here. for your mom?
buffy: yeah, thanks.
ben: she's not feeling better?
buffy: not yet but she will be. i'm starting to figure out what's wrong.
scene direction: cut to 9 int. sunnydale industrial district- factory- day 9
scene direction: the same factory where buffy found the glowing orb. a voice echoes in the cavernous chamber, speaking in czech.
man: god help me!
scene direction: pan down to reveal the monk from the czech monastery crouched on the floor amid a circle of lit candles and magickal icons similar to the one we saw before. he's marking locations on a map of sunnydale. suddenly, a deep boom reverberates through the factory and he looks up fearfully at the tempered steel door. the massive portal shudders as it's struck by some titanic force from outside.
monk: the beast!
scene direction: the pounding continues and the steel buckles inward with each blow. the door suddenly flies into the room, taking a good portion of the surrounding wall with it.
scene direction: when the dust settles, glory, an attractive blond woman in a form-fitting red dress stands incongruously amid the rubble. she strides into the room and smiles manically at the monk who cringes in fear.
glory: there you are. i have been looking all over for you.
scene direction: fade out.
scene change: *** act ii ***
scene direction: cut to 10 int. the magic box- day 10
scene direction: giles hands a couple their purchase with a smile.
giles: thank you for choosing to shop at the magic box and please do come again.
scene direction: willow stands at the counter, perusing an ancient tome. giles waits until the couple leaves the store, then bounds over to her, giddy.
giles: did you see that? customers! real, live customers! they came in and i gave them things and they gave me money and then they left! it's brilliant!
scene direction: he jumps back to the cash register to deposit the cash.
willow: congratulations. you're an official capitalist running dog. but i gotta tell ya...on the orbular front? we're batting zeroes.
giles: well, we'll just have to keep trying.
scene direction: a group of customers enters and begins browsing. giles calls out to them.
giles: if there's anything you need help with, let me know.
scene direction: one of the customers is anya who stops at the main display table, examining the items. she picks up a small bag of dust and carries it over to giles.
anya: your conjuring powder is grotesquely over-priced.
giles: anya...
anya: i'm sorry. i'm nearly out of money. i've never had to afford things before and it's making me bitter.
giles: the change is palpable. that stuff doesn't come cheap.
anya: well, you're getting ripped off. i could hook you up with the troll that sheds it.
scene direction: buffy runs in, flustered.
buffy: giles, i have an idea what's making my mom sick.
giles: have you spoken with her doctors?
buffy: they won't find anything. what's hurting her- it's supernatural.
scene direction: buffy picks up the orb
buffy: the night watchman who found this thing? he went crazy- like overnight.
scene direction: willow, giles and anya back away cautiously.
buffy: it won't hurt us. i had it on me all night. but this guy, he saw things... he said things.
giles: such as?
buffy: they'll come at me through my family.
giles: who will?
buffy: i don't know... yet. but whatever touched this guy, it made him see through what the rest of us are seeing. he knew someone's hurting my mom and they're trying to get to me.
giles: it's possible but still... the ramblings of a madman aren't much to go on.
buffy: yeah, but it's a start. we need to find out who's making my mom sick and how.
willow: then what?
buffy: then i hunt them... find them... and kill them.
scene direction: cut to 11 int. sunnydale industrial district- factory- day 11
scene direction: glory has the monk tied to a chair and gagged. he's been beaten severely. she paces around him while she talks, frequently getting right up in his terrified face.
glory: you know, when you think about it, i'm the victim here. first off, i don't even want to be here. and i'm not talking about this room or this city or this state or this planet. i'm talking about the whole mortal coil now, you know? it's disgusting! the food... the clothes... the people. i could crap a better existence than this.
scene direction: glory beat
glory: but... okay- and feel free to tell me if this next part gets a little too personal, because i'm told i have boundary issues- but i'm hurt! yes, by your incredibly selfish behavior. newsflash, hairdo - it's not always about you. all i want is the key! why? why can't you tell me where the key is?
scene direction: glory beat; realizes
glory: oh! forgive me... monkey. sometimes i just... i get so anxious- like there's something deep inside of me and it's swelling up and it's making me crazy!- that i forget there's all that duct tape on your face!
scene direction: glory rips the tape off violently and smiles at him. it's clear now that she's insane.
glory: now... tell me where the key is.
scene direction: glory shoves her knuckles into the monk's eyes and wrenches his nose.
glory: or i'm going bowling.
scene direction: she holds him there, sputtering in pain, then releases him.
glory: it's okay, it's okay, it's okay! the stutter's sexy. keep it coming.
scene direction: the monk stares at her for a beat then whispers in czech.
monk: zabbij me... zabbij me.
scene direction: monk kill me... kill me.
scene direction: glory stands up, enraged.
glory: josve novem svete, tak prohoba speak american!
scene direction: glory we're in the new world now so please, for god's sake, speak american!
monk: i... will tell you...
scene direction: monk spits
monk: nothing.
scene direction: the monk glowers at her, scared but defiant. glory sighs and suddenly seems on the verge of tears.
glory: fine. you know what i wish? i wish that you could feel what i'm feeling right now.
scene direction: she backs away from the monk and we now see a security guard chained to a steam pipe behind her. he hunches over, terrified.
guard: lady, whatever you are... whatever you're on, please.
scene direction: glory ignores him
glory: 'cause i don't know how much more of this i can take.
guard: i have a wife. her name's jennifer. we have two daughters.
scene direction: glory is in her own world. her focus is on the monk. she pays no attention to the guard.
scene direction: glory to monk
glory: i bet this is fun for you, isn't it? say it. why? you don't even own the damn thing and i want it, i need it and i gotta have it now and you keep refusing to tell me where the key is!
scene direction: glory starts to come apart mentally.
glory: it's typical! the whole mortal meatsack comes complete with stink and bile sweat and protein. yes, i said humans! not now, mommy's talking! wriggling, piling, prowling, crawling, clowning, cavorting, doing it over and over and over and over until someone's gonna sit down on their tuffet and make this birthing stop!
scene direction: with a strangled cry of despair, glory puts her fingers on either side of the hapless guard's head. white light flares and his eyes go wide with shock and pain. he collapses to the floor, whimpering and gasping, while glory takes a deep breath and stands, calm and refreshed.
glory: ahh... that is so much better.
scene direction: cut to 12 int. the magic box- day 12.
scene direction: the shop is bustling with customers now. anya is working the register and buffy and willow are at the counter, busily researching. a customer approaches willow with an antique hourglass.
customer: do you gift wrap?
willow: do we!
scene direction: willow to anya
willow: do we?
scene direction: willow anya nods
willow: oh! we do. little help...
scene direction: giles is desperately trying to manage the customers and answer a flurry of questions.
giles: no, no. ground cloven hooves are 30% off. the whole ones are full price.
scene direction: giles turns around
giles: that's not... candy!
scene direction: he looks up with relief as xander enters the store.
giles: xander! there's too many of them... people! and they all seem to want things.
xander: i hear ya. stay british. you'll be okay.
scene direction: he pats giles on the shoulder then heads over to anya.
xander: the thousand-yard stare. damn! you hate to see it on any man but especially in retail.
scene direction: anya wraps up a woman's purchase and hands it to her.
scene direction: anya to woman
anya: please go.
scene direction: the woman walks away, shaking her head.
xander: anya, the shopkeeper's union of america called. they wanted me to tell you that "please go" just got replaced with "have a nice day".
anya: but i have their money. who cares what kind of day they have?
xander: no one. it's just a long cultural tradition of raging insincerity. embrace it.
scene direction: anya calls out to her customer.
anya: hey, you! have a nice day.
xander: there's my girl!
scene direction: anya grins with pride and xander wanders over to buffy. willow is utterly failing at gift wrapping the hourglass.
scene direction: xander to buffy
xander: did you ever think in a million years you'd miss the high school library?
buffy: someone put a spell on my mom. something to make it seem like she's sick.
xander: that's a new kind of nasty. any suspects?
buffy: well, i've got the list narrowed down to just under infinity.
scene direction: willow carries the hourglass over to anya, the wrapping paper hanging off it.
willow: does this look right to you?
anya: sure, if you wrapped it with your feet.
scene direction: anya takes the hourglass and starts wrapping it herself. willow frowns and turns away.
anya: you know, buffy, there used to be this french sorcerer back in the 16th i-don't-know-what named-
giles: cloutier?
anya: so cute in his little knickers. but he had this one spell demons just hated called tirer la couture.
buffy: "rotate many foodstuffs"?
willow: "pull the curtain back".
anya: a spell to see spells... well, a trance to see spells, actually, but you get the idea. try that.
buffy: what do you mean "see" spells?
giles: well, all spells leave a trace signature. it's just not perceptible to the human eye. in this case, it could be the image of a hand choking your mother.
anya: or a cloud of mist around her.
willow: or maybe the shape of the demon that's performing the spell?
giles: possible, yes.
scene direction: anya holds up the perfectly-wrapped hourglass, beaming.
buffy: okay, so i'll do what monsieur silk knickers did. i'll go home, i'll get trance-y and i'll see what's affecting my mom.
willow: i don't know, buffy. trances?
giles: yes, buffy, the sorcerer cloutier was legendary. his skills at achieving higher states of consciousness were-
buffy: better than mine?
scene direction: buffy to willow
buffy: i knew he was gonna say that.
scene direction: buffy to giles
buffy: but i've been practicing concentration skills. i know i'm close.
scene direction: giles serious
giles: are you ready?
buffy: it's my mom. i'll get ready.
scene direction: buffy to willow
buffy: what do i need?
scene direction: cut to 13 int. summers home- buffy's room- day 13
scene direction: buffy sits on the floor in the middle of her bedroom and dumps out a bag of incense, powders and other magickal talismans.
buffy: thanks for coming over. i really appreciate the help.
scene direction: riley steps into frame and hunkers down next to her.
riley: sure thing. so what do i do?
buffy: lots. tons. lots and lots of tons. this is all kinda-
riley: new terrain?
buffy: all prayin', no slayin'. okay, so the incense needs to be ignited... and there's a job. and this stuff needs to get poured around me in a circle, counter-clockwise-
riley: so you need me to light incense and pour sand?
buffy: magick incense... and spooky sand... and the ritual itself is-
riley: something you do alone. you sure this isn't just your way of trying to make me feel less- what are the words?- cute and weak and kittenish?
buffy: kitteny.
riley: right. much manlier. look... i really am okay.
buffy: i know.
riley: so i'm not quite super guy anymore. it was borrowed power anyway. had to give it back some time.
buffy: i know you can handle yourself. i just didn't want to see you get hurt.
riley: maybe instead of you trying to take care of me, we agree to take care of each other. deal?
scene direction: buffy smiles and nods.
buffy: done.
scene direction: she stands and they shake hands. riley leans over and kisses her forehead.
riley: for luck.
scene direction: he turns to go but she pulls him back.
buffy: hey, a girl needs more luck than that.
scene direction: riley smiles and kisses her tenderly.
riley: have a nice trip.
scene direction: he heads out and she closes her bedroom door behind him.
scene direction: time cut to buffy prepares for the ritual - incense is lit, conjuring powder is poured in a circle on the carpet. she sits, cross-legged, in the center and places her hands on her knees. she closes her eyes and begins meditating.
scene direction: the silence is broken by a knock on the door.
scene direction: dawn o.s.
dawn: what are you doing?
scene direction: buffy frustrated
buffy: my boyfriend. go away.
scene direction: dawn o.s.

scene direction: cut to 18 int. summers home- upstairs hallway- day 18
scene direction: dawn is hurt. despite everything, she really wants her big sister's approval. she turns and walks back down the hall, dejected. she goes into her room and slams the door.
scene direction: cut to 19 int. summers home- buffy's room- day 19
scene direction: buffy returns to the circle, sits, and resumes her meditation.
scene direction: time cut to night. buffy is still in the lotus position in deep meditation, her trance deepening with each passing moment. her eyes suddenly snap open and she gets up and leaves her room. the house around her appears grainy, sepia-toned, reality slightly altered.
scene direction: cut to 20 int. summers home- upstairs hallway- night 20
scene direction: buffy makes her way down the hall and stairs to the living room, taking in her surroundings as she goes, the familiar house suddenly appearing strange and new.
scene direction: cut to 21 int. summers home- living room- night 21
scene direction: joyce's voice comes to buffy as if from a great distance. buffy turns to find joyce dressed and putting on her overcoat.
joyce: buffy?
buffy: mom? are you going out?
scene direction: buffy studies her mother carefully but sees nothing out of the ordinary.
joyce: well, either modern medicine's working or i just took the world's best placebo. either way, i'm going out for a couple of hours.
buffy: nothing...
joyce: hmm?
buffy: there's nothing.
scene direction: buffy stares intently at her mother, trying to detect anything abnormal, but everything seems fine. her attention is suddenly drawn to a family photograph on the wall behind joyce. the picture shows joyce, buffy and dawn smiling happily. dawn's image appears and disappears, flickering in and out of the photo like a bad television reception.
joyce: are you sure you're feeling okay? you seem a little out of it.
scene direction: joyce beat
joyce: hey... buffy?
scene direction: buffy covers
buffy: yeah. i'm fine. long day's all. you go, have a good time.
scene direction: joyce smiles wistfully.
joyce: you're so grown up.
scene direction: joyce turns and heads out. as soon as she's gone, buffy immediately finds another family portrait and finds the same thing - dawn fading in and out.
scene direction: cut to 22 int. summers home- upstairs hallway- night 22
scene direction: buffy approaches dawn's room and cautiously opens the door. dawn is not there and buffy walks slowly in.
scene direction: cut to 23 int. summers home- dawn's room- night 23
scene direction: buffy stands in wonder as the entire room around her shifts back and forth between dawn's normal teen girl setting and a room full of boxes and odds & ends - an unoccupied storage room. dawn's voice echoes from far away, calling to buffy.
dawn: buffy? buffy.
scene direction: buffy turns to find dawn, angry at her intrusion. but dawn herself is fading in and out of reality along with all her things.
dawn: who said you could come in my room?
scene direction: buffy finally realizes what's going on.
scene direction: buffy cold
buffy: you're not my sister.
scene direction: fade out.
scene change: *** act iii ***
scene direction: cut to 24 int. summers home- dawn's room- night 24
scene direction: resume. buffy stares coldly at dawn.
dawn: yeah! like i even want to be related to your nasty self-
scene direction: buffy rushes forward and seizes dawn by the arms.
dawn: ow! what are you doing?
buffy: what are you?
dawn: get off me!
buffy: you want to hurt me?
dawn: let go of me, you freak!
buffy: then you deal with me.
dawn: i'm telling mom!
buffy: you stay away from my mother!
scene direction: buffy shoves dawn against the wall with tremendous force. dawn stares at buffy, shocked, and buffy stares back, her gaze unwavering.
scene direction: the moment is broken by the ringing of the phone.
scene direction: cut to 25 int. summers home- living room- night 25
scene direction: buffy answers the phone.
buffy: what?
scene direction: cut with 26 int. the magic box- night 26
scene direction: giles tries to hear buffy over the bustle of customers.
giles: buffy? oh, i'm glad i've caught you. i think we may have underestimated what we're dealing with.
scene direction: buffy checks to see if dawn's nearby before answering.
buffy: go on.
giles: we've uncovered more than expected about this orb. it's called the dagon sphere and it has a history going back many centuries.
buffy: what's it do?
giles: it's a protective device, used to ward off ancient primordial evil.
buffy: any word on what this evil looks like?
giles: unfortunately, no. this is where-
scene direction: giles to customer
giles: excuse me.
scene direction: giles to buffy
giles: this is where accounts get vague. all we've managed to uncover so far is the dagon sphere was created to repel that which cannot be named.
buffy: i'm going to go back to the factory where i found it. whoever planted this doohickey's got answers.
giles: buffy, you've heard me say this before but do be careful. anything that goes unnamed is usually an object of deep worship or great fear- maybe both. have you completed the trance? seen what's harming your mother?
buffy: that's the thing... i just saw-
scene direction: buffy breaks off when she senses dawn standing behind her.
giles: yes?
buffy: nothing. it didn't work.
scene direction: she drops the phone in its cradle and faces dawn.
dawn: what are you talking about?
buffy: slayer stuff. i'm going out.
scene direction: buffy heads for the door.
dawn: do you really think i care you're the slayer?
scene direction: buffy stops and turns to her.
buffy: what's that supposed to mean?
scene direction: dawn gives her a cold look.
buffy: i'll be home in an hour.
dawn: mom's coming back.
scene direction: buffy hard
buffy: i'll be back first.
scene direction: with that, buffy grabs her jacket and leaves.
scene direction: cut to 27 ext. summers home- front yard- night 27.
scene direction: buffy walks down the front steps and is halfway across the lawn when she stops, sensing something. she reaches behind a tree and yanks spike out into the yard.
buffy: spike.
spike: hi, buffy.
buffy: don't take this the wrong way but...
scene direction: she socks him in the nose.
spike: ow!
buffy: what are you doing here? five words or less.
scene direction: spike counts the words on his fingers.
spike: out... for... a... walk... bitch.
buffy: out for a walk at night by my house. no one has time for this,
scene direction: william.
spike: on your merry way, then. you know, contrary to one's self-involved world-view, your house happens to be directly between parts... and other parts of this town. and i would pass by in the day but i feel i'm outgrowing my whole "burst into flame" phase.
buffy: fine. keep going, i cut you a break.
spike: oh, yeah. okay, let me guess... you won't kill me? wooo... the whole crowd-pleasing threats-and-swagger routine. how stunningly original. you know, i'm just passing through. satisfied? you know, i really hope so because god knows you need some satisfaction in life besides shagging captain cardboard and i never really liked you anyway and... and you have stupid hair.
scene direction: he turns and stalks off into the night leaving buffy not just a little bit perplexed. she looks down at the base of the tree and notices a dozen or so cigarette butts where spike was standing. having no time to worry about it now, buffy heads off to the factory. she doesn't notice dawn watching intently from her second-floor window.
scene direction: cut to 28 ext. sunnydale industrial district- factory lot- night 28
scene direction: buffy easily snaps the chain on the fence and heads inside.
scene direction: cut to 29 int. sunnydale industrial district- factory- night 29
scene direction: buffy flicks on her flashlight and starts exploring the musty corridors of the abandoned building. eventually, she comes across the tremendous gaping hole in the wall and the twisted remains of the tempered steel door. she examines the wreckage with concern.
scene direction: cut to 30 int. summers home- foyer- night 30
scene direction: joyce enters, looking pained.
joyce: buffy? girls?
scene direction: no answer.
joyce: where is everybody?
scene direction: she looks in the living room and dining room but sees no one. suddenly, dawn is right behind her, holding a teacup and saucer. joyce starts.
dawn: hi, mom.
joyce: oh! dawn. where's buffy?
dawn: you don't have to worry about her.
joyce: you're probably right. i mean, it's not like she's never patrolled before. anyway, i was feeling kind of- what's the medical term? - crappy. so i called off the big night out.
dawn: want tea, mom? i made it for you.
scene direction: cut to 31 int. sunnydale industrial district- factory- night 31
scene direction: buffy shines her light over the shattered remains of the blast door, then looks deeper into the room. she sees the monk, semi-conscious and tied to the chair.
buffy: whoa.
scene direction: she runs to his aid and starts loosening his restraints.
buffy: it was you who planted the dagon sphere, right? i got it. don't worry. i'm stronger than i look.
scene direction: glory silently approaches buffy from behind.
buffy: i have had experience with stuff like this before. best of all...
scene direction: buffy whirls around and seizes glory by the throat.
scene direction: buffy cold
buffy: i'm not stupid.
scene direction: glory gives buffy a withering look, wrenches buffy's arm from her neck and backhands the slayer with such force that she flies 50 feet across the room and impacts the cement wall so hard she cracks it. buffy falls to floor and looks up at glory, stunned at her power.
glory: you sure about that last part?
scene direction: fade out.
scene change: *** act iv ***
scene direction: cut to 32 int. the magic box- night 32.
scene direction: the jingling bell signals the departure of the final customer of the evening. giles, xander and willow sit around the reading table, exhausted. anya is at the register counting the day's receipts.
giles: would someone please rip that bloody bell off its hinges?
xander: would that involve moving?
willow: my feet are numb.
xander: i'll see your numbness and i'll raise you a lower back pain.
giles: i think i liked it better when demons would just crash in here and tear the place apart. just seemed so much simpler.
anya: you're out of crystal balls. those babies are really popular with the amateurs. better re-stock and raise the price 10%. make it 15.
giles: anya...
anya: your cash register looks like squirrels nest in it.
giles: anya...
anya: and the hand of glory packs some serious raw power. better institute a seven-day background check for-
giles: anya!
scene direction: giles beat
giles: would you like a job?
anya: okay.
giles: good. then we can talk shop tomorrow.
scene direction: anya smiles
anya: okay... boss.
willow: hey, any word from buffy on how her spell went?
giles: she said it didn't work. now she's off investigating whoever left the dagon sphere behind.
xander: you're not worried about the slaymaster general, are you big g?
giles: no, no. i just hope she isn't doing anything too rash.
scene direction: cut to 33 int. sunnydale industrial district- factory- night 33
scene direction: buffy slams into the cement wall again, face first. the wall cracks under the impact. glory strides toward her and seizes her by the shoulders.
glory: and another thing? i just want you to know...
scene direction: she slams buffy into a support pillar and pummels her.
glory: the whole "beat ya to death" thing i'm doing? it's valuable time out of life that i'm never gonna get back.
scene direction: buffy tries to fight back but glory grabs both her arms and wrenches them downward. buffy cries out in pain.
glory: wait, i've always wanted to try this. you know that thing with worms where if you have one, you rip it in half, you got two worms? do you think that'll work with you?
scene direction: buffy slams her head into glory's face and breaks free. glory cries out in shock.
glory: you hit me! what, are you crazy?
scene direction: buffy presses the attack, hitting and kicking for all she's worth, forcing glory backward, but her blows seem more to offend glory than injure her.
glory: you can't go around hitting people. what, were you born in a barn? fine. be that way.
scene direction: glory easily blocks buffy's next blow and swings her around into the wall. she sends a blow for buffy's head but the slayer ducks at the last instant and glory's fist punches through the concrete. glory picks buffy up by the throat and holds her there, gasping for air.
glory: i just noticed something. you have superpowers. that is so cool. can you fly?
scene direction: she hurls buffy clear across the room where she lands, dazed, next to the dying monk. buffy gets to her feet and prepares to engage glory again but realizes her priority is the monk. she helps him out of the chair.
glory: hey! hands off my holy man!
scene direction: buffy picks him up and runs toward the window. realizing what buffy is about to do, glory charges after them. she's too late - buffy crashes through the window with the monk and tumbles to the ground below. glory stumbles to a halt when the heel on her shoe breaks off. she takes off the shoe and glowers at it in frustration.
scene direction: cut to 34 ext. sunnydale industrial district- factory lot- night 34
scene direction: buffy helps the monk up and they escape across the parking lot.
scene direction: cut to 35 int. sunnydale industrial district- factory- night 35
scene direction: glory whips her shoe across the room in a fit of rage and stomps her feet. the tremendous force from her blow cracks the floor and she looks up as the support beams shatter and the ceiling comes crashing down on her.
glory: oh, shi-
scene direction: cut to 36 ext. sunnydale industrial district- factory lot- night 36
scene direction: a cloud of dust roils out of the shattered window above as buffy helps the critically injured monk across the lot.
monk: stop. please.
buffy: no. we have to keep going.
scene direction: they stumble across the lot to the chain-link fence surrounding the property. the monk collapses against it, gasping.
monk: my journey's done, i think.
buffy: don't get metaphory on me. we're going.
scene direction: she tries to lift him again but he stops her.
monk: you have to... the key. you must protect the key.
buffy: fine. we can protect the key together, okay, just far, far from here.
monk: many more die if you don't keep it safe.
buffy: how? what is it?
monk: the key is energy. it's a portal. it opens the door...
buffy: the dagon sphere?
monk: no. for centuries it had no form at all. my brethren, its only keepers. then the abomination found us. we had to hide the key, gave it form, molded it flesh... made it human and sent it to you.
scene direction: buffy stares at him in shock as the realization sinks in.
buffy: dawn...
monk: she's the key.
buffy: you put that in my house?
monk: we knew the slayer would protect.
buffy: my memories... my mom's?
monk: we built them.
scene direction: buffy angry
buffy: then un-build them! this is my life you're-
scene direction: the monk starts coughing heavily. he's fading fast.
monk: you cannot abandon.
buffy: i didn't ask for this! i don't even know... what is she?
monk: human... now human. and helpless. please... she's an innocent in this. she needs you.
buffy: she's not my sister?
monk: she doesn't know that.
scene direction: the monk exhales one last time and dies. buffy is stunned, her life turned upside down.
scene direction: cut to 37 int. summers home- foyer- night 37
scene direction: buffy enters, still somewhat in a daze. she finds her mother and dawn together on the couch in the living room.
joyce: you're home.
scene direction: dawn gets up and leaves the room.
dawn: i wasn't bothering her.
joyce: what was that all about?
buffy: nothing.
scene direction: buffy beat
buffy: sister stuff.

scene direction: buffy opens the door and stands in the threshold. dawn sits quietly on her bed.
buffy: i'm sorry.
dawn: you hurt my arm.
buffy: i know.
dawn: butthole.
buffy: really sorry.
dawn: i tell you i have this theory? it goes where you're the one who's not my sister. 'cause mom adopted you from a shoebox full of baby howler monkeys and never told you 'cause it could hurt your delicate baby feelings.
scene direction: buffy takes a few steps into the room.
buffy: that's your theory?
dawn: explains your fashion sense. and your smell.
scene direction: buffy sincere
buffy: i'm sorry, okay?
dawn: broken record much?
buffy: you can't even take an apology. you always do that. ever since-
scene direction: buffy stops herself and sits down next to dawn.
buffy: i just had a bad day.
dawn: well, join the club.
buffy: can i be president?
dawn: i'm president. you could be the janitor.
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: okay.
scene direction: buffy reaches up and strokes dawn's hair.
dawn: buffy?
buffy: yeah?
dawn: what's wrong with mom?
buffy: i don't know.
scene direction: buffy and dawn share a troubled look as buffy continues stroking her sister's hair.
scene change: fade to black.
scene direction: end.
