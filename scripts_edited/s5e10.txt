scene change: *** episode begins ***
scene direction: fade in on a pair of shoes. pan across the body of dawn, lying across several hospital waiting room chairs. the camera pulls out and we see that dawn is asleep with her head in buffy's lap as buffy strokes her hair. riley sits next to buffy, dozing off. buffy sighs.
scene direction: shot of the hospital corridor with various personnel coming and going.
scene direction: riley wakes up as someone walks over to them.
giles: just me. sorry. can i get you anything?
buffy: no, thank you.
giles: riley?
riley: no, i'm fine.
scene direction: giles nods, looks fidgety, walks off. we discover willow and xander sitting nearby. behind them we see the nurses' station.
willow: what time is it?
xander: there's a clock behind you, will.
scene direction: willow pouty
willow: i know, but there's a watch right above your hand.
scene direction: xander shows her his watch. willow frowns.
willow: that can't be right.
scene direction: willow turns to look at the clock above nurses' station
willow: oh.
scene direction: she sits back and exchanges a look with xander.
scene direction: cut back to buffy and riley. buffy leans her head back and sighs loudly. riley puts his hand on her knee.
buffy: i can't stand this. what's taking so long?
riley: it doesn't mean anything.
buffy: you think?
riley: i'd worry more if your mom was out of surgery quickly. might mean that, you know, they couldn't do much.
scene direction: buffy frowns, looks down at dawn, looks up. suddenly she puts her hand over riley's which is still on her leg.
scene direction: shot of the hospital corridor. we see the doctor walking toward us.
scene direction: dawn wakes up as buffy slides out from under her. everyone stands up.
scene direction: the doctor walks closer.
scene direction: zoom in on buffy, nervously waiting for the news with riley and dawn behind her.
scene direction: wolf howl. opening credits.
scene change: *** act i ***
scene direction: fade back in on the hospital scene.
dr. kriegel: okay, your mom's in recovery.
buffy: what happened, is she all right?
dr. kriegel: it was possible to visualize the tumor completely, which means i was able to get all of it. so, barring complications in recovery ... i think your mother's going to be fine.
scene direction: dr. kriegel everyone reacts with relief
dr. kriegel: of course we're still going to have to watch your mother carefully, and, uh, have her back in here for some follow-up testing,
scene direction: dr. kriegel buffy nods
dr. kriegel: but, uh, overall i'd consider the procedure a complete success.
scene direction: smiles all round. everyone hugs each other. giles and xander start to hug, then settle for a handshake instead.
scene direction: buffy hugging riley
buffy: oh my goodness, doctor, thank you, thank you so much.
dr. kriegel: please, it's my pleasure.
scene direction: buffy hugs him and he yells in pain as she forgets her slayer-strength. she gasps and pulls back.
buffy: sorry. sorry!
scene direction: the doctor puts a hand on his back and gives buffy a funny look.
scene change: cut to exterior shot of xander's apartment building, night.
scene change: cut to interior of xander's apartment. xander, anya and dawn are eating chinese food around a low table.
dawn: when i was younger, i used to put my chopsticks in my mouth like this,
scene direction: dawn she puts chopsticks into her mouth so they stick out like very long fangs
dawn: and then buffy would chase me around the house yelling,
scene direction: dawn makes claw hands
dawn: 'i'm the slayer, i'm going to get you!'
scene direction: dawn laughs
anya: that's disturbing. you're emotionally scarred and will end up badly.
scene direction: dawn removes chopsticks
dawn: no, it was great. i mean, she didn't actually stake me in the heart, you know.
xander: buffy's pretty cool like that.
scene direction: xander gets up to clear the dishes
xander: so, what do you wanna do now, dawnster? keeping in mind that i won't chase you because i'm old and i'm stuffed full of moo goo gai starch.
scene direction: dawn starts to reply but anya interrupts.
anya: well, we could play that game again, life. that was fun.
scene direction: dawn frowns
dawn: for you. you always win.
anya: well ... we can make a wager this time. you can give me real money. that would be different.
scene direction: xander sarcastic
xander: and after we teach her to gamble, maybe we can all get drunk!
scene direction: anya not getting it
anya: i don't think the bar would serve her, but we could bring something in.
scene direction: anya to dawn
anya: strawberry schnapps taste just like real ice cream.
xander: okay, how's about a movie?
scene direction: xander opens the newspaper and walks back to them
xander: they're showing them in theaters now. i hear it's like watching a video with a bunch of strangers and a sticky floor.
scene direction: xander he lays out the newspaper where he and dawn can both look at it
scene direction: dawn points
dawn: that one looks sad.
xander: the chimp playing hockey? is that based on the chekhov?
scene direction: anya comes running over and grabs the paper eagerly.
anya: there's a chimp playing hockey?
dawn: um, no, the other one. i don't wanna see a sad movie.
anya: we have to see the chimp playing hockey! that's hilarious! the ice is so slippery, and, and monkeys are all irrational. we have to see this.
xander: you pick, dawn. this is your night. we are celebrating your mom's good news.
scene direction: anya looks chastised.
scene direction: anya softly
anya: go monkey. choose monkey.
dawn: it's okay. you guys don't have to make a big deal for me. i'm only sleeping over here so buffy and riley can boink.
scene direction: xander looks embarrassed.
xander: no, that's not, that's not it at all, they just need time to, uh...
scene direction: xander clears throat
xander: be tender. relax.
scene direction: anya smiles and rubs xander's chest.
scene direction: anya to dawn
anya: he's not very convincing, is he?
scene direction: dawn shakes her head in agreement.
dawn: 'alone time' always translates into 'get dawn out of the house so we can have loud obnoxious sex.'
scene direction: xander looks like he wants to object, but doesn't. anya smiles, then suddenly realizes something.
scene direction: anya softly to xander
anya: oh, does that mean we can't?
scene direction: xander gives her a look.
scene change: cut to candles burning on a mantle. soft romantic music. pan over to buffy and riley dancing in the darkened summers home.
buffy: can we put this song on repeat?
riley: whatever you want.
buffy: can we put the whole night on repeat?
riley: absolutely.
buffy: good.
scene direction: buffy sighs happily
buffy: mm, i can't believe how relaxed i feel. it's like all the tension's just left my body.
riley: oh, really? 'cause i had that scheduled for a little later on.
buffy: scheduled? are you planning on seducing me, mr. finn?
riley: always.
scene direction: they kiss.
riley: i want tonight to be special for you.
buffy: it's more than special. it's perfect.
riley: well, i'm glad. you deserve it after everything you've been through.
buffy: well, it's nothing compared to what my mom had to deal with.
scene direction: riley nods
riley: it was a lot. and you were incredible.
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: not really. just covering for the weepy chicken within.
riley: don't sell yourself short. you stayed strong throughout, buffy. you never even cried.
buffy: oh, i cried. i cried so hard, i didn't think i was gonna be able to stop.
scene direction: riley looks surprised. she puts her head on his shoulder.
riley: oh.
buffy: that's all in the past now. mom's out of the woods, and i'm here with you. that's all that matters.
scene direction: she lifts her head up and they kiss again.
scene change: fade to bare legs moving together under bedsheets. pan up to buffy and riley in bed, kissing, naked with strategically placed sheets. riley is on top. panting noises. lots of kissing and writhing. closeup on buffy's face as she closes her eyes in pleasure. pan across them to the window.
scene change: cut to exterior shot of the bedroom window. we see spike standing on the ground below, smoking a cigarette and looking up at the window. he sighs.
scene change: cut to the bedroom. buffy is asleep. riley watches her for a moment, then slides out of the bed. we can see a partially healed cut on his upper chest and a small bandage on his arm.
scene change: cut to spike outside, putting out his cigarette and turning to leave. he stops as he hears the house's front door open and sees riley come out. riley doesn't see spike. he closes the door quietly and walks off. spike follows.
scene change: cut to riley walking through a dark alley. spike still following. riley walks up to an old warehouse, up some stairs to a door. spike watches, frowning.
scene change: cut to exterior hospital, day.
scene change: cut to joyce's hospital room. joyce has a hand mirror and is looking at her reflection. there's a large bandage on her head.
joyce: i don't know, buffy. i think i'll look like i have a cat on my head.
scene direction: we see buffy holding a wig.
buffy: but a very well-groomed cat.
joyce: i think maybe i'll ... stick with a scarf.
buffy: come on, wigs are fun. we can get you a whole bunch of different ones. you know, you can be, like, sixties mom, action mom...
scene direction: buffy wiggles her hips, suggestively
buffy: french maid mom...
scene direction: joyce smiles
joyce: i must be getting better, 'cause you're making fun of me.
buffy: well, you know.
scene direction: buffy sits on the bed
buffy: got a lot of time to make up for.
joyce: you have more important things to make up. i know you've been missing a lot of school.
buffy: i may have to take a few incompletes, but i will make it through the semester.
joyce: well, what about slaying and your friends? i want you to have your life back.
buffy: right now i'd rather be here, styling your beautiful new plastic dream hair.
joyce: fair enough, but you don't have to keep me company all night. go out, have fun, get, get riley to take you to a movie or something.
buffy: i gave riley the day off.
joyce: i don't think he thinks of you as a chore, buffy.
buffy: i know that. look, i told him to make plans with his friends because i wanted to have you all to myself, okay? besides, i can see him any time.
scene direction: buffy gets up, turns away to put the wig on a stand
buffy: and i'm sure he'll come over later looking for a little...
scene direction: buffy suddenly stops herself, turns around to give joyce an innocent look
buffy: bible study.
scene direction: buffy nods
joyce: well, good. i mean, just as long as the two of you are spending some quality time with ... the lord.
buffy: we are. absolutely.
scene change: cut to looks like a hotel room. a commando is sitting on a sofa fiddling with some high-tech equipment - he has headphones on his ears. graham walks over to a table where major ellis has some maps spread out.
ellis: what've we got?
graham: belize. last transmission. infra-red scans say they're-
ellis: breeding. they're not gonna stay in that village for long. looks like we got ourselves a hot spot. tell the men to get ready.
scene direction: graham starts to leave, pauses.
graham: what about riley?
scene direction: graham ellis looks confused
graham: agent finn.
scene direction: graham ellis nods
graham: i'm telling you, sir, if we go in for a sweep and drop, he's definitely a guy we want on the team.
scene direction: ellis nods
ellis: well, let's bring him on board.
graham: it, uh, might take a little convincing.
ellis: why? what's he got here in sunnydale that's so special?
scene change: cut to buffy in bed, asleep, alone. we hear the door open. buffy wakes up halfway.
scene direction: buffy sleepy
buffy: riley?
scene direction: we see spike standing by the door.
spike: it's me.
scene direction: buffy wakes up fully, sits up holding the sheet to her chest.
buffy: every time you show up like this, you risk all of your parts, you know that?
spike: i wouldn't be here if i didn't have a good reason. as usual, i'm here to help you, and i - are you naked under there?
scene direction: buffy rolls her eyes
buffy: get out.
spike: no, i'm serious. i mean, not about the naked part, i mean...
scene direction: spike cranes his neck trying to see under the blankets
buffy: get out or i will drop you out head-first.
scene direction: spike lowers his voice, speaks intensely.
spike: i wanna show you something.
scene direction: buffy realizing he is serious
buffy: what?
spike: you need to see this.
scene direction: buffy sighs.
spike: but we need to move if we wanna get there in time.
scene direction: buffy raises her eyebrows to indicate that she can't get dressed with spike watching. he scoffs.
spike: oh, please! like i give a bloody damn.
scene direction: he turns his back, and then makes an agonized face, forcing himself not to look as buffy reaches for her clothing.
scene change: cut to spike leading buffy through the alley, up the stairs to the warehouse. buffy looks confused. spike opens the door for her.
scene direction: they enter the warehouse and see a bunch of people being sucked on by vampires. random trash, old bathtubs, etc., all around. buffy stares at it in dismay.
spike: don't stop, slayer. this isn't what we're here for.
scene direction: we see two large male vampires overseeing things. one of them is putting some money into his vest.
scene direction: buffy looks around with a frown, looks at spike. he nods toward some stairs. they approach the stairs and start up them.
scene direction: one of the vamps grabs spike and spins him around.
vamp 1: what do you think you're doing?
spike: just having a little look, mate. keep it down.
scene direction: he turns away but the vamp stops him again.
vamp 1: you can't go up there.
scene direction: spike grabs the vamp by the throat and shoves him to the floor.
spike: i said keep it down.
scene direction: buffy watches all this from halfway up the stairs.
scene direction: spike turns, adjusting his jacket, and they go up the stairs.
scene direction: the second level is just as messy as the first. spike leads buffy through the mess to a slightly open door. she looks suspiciously at him, then goes through the door and discovers riley, sitting bare-chested on a mattress on the floor, with a female vamp sitting on his lap, drinking from his arm. he doesn't see buffy yet.
riley: harder.
scene direction: the vampire continues sucking. buffy gasps. riley looks up and sees her.
scene direction: closeup on buffy staring in horror. blackout.
scene change: *** act ii ***
scene direction: fade back in on the same scene. the vamp continues to feed from riley. riley looks at buffy and gulps.
riley: buffy.
scene direction: buffy stares at him, backs away and runs out. spike smirks.
riley: buffy!
spike: we only came here because we care about you, friend.
scene direction: spike riley shoves the vamp aside and gets up
spike: you need help.
scene direction: spike smirks and walks out.
scene change: cut to buffy hurrying down the stairs. vamp #2 hands something to vamp #1 and moves to intercept buffy.
vamp 2: hey. hey, hey.
scene direction: he steps in front of her but she gives him a shove and he flies backward, hitting the wall as buffy exits.
scene direction: spike comes down the stairs a few steps behind. vamp 2 growls as spike passes him.
scene change: cut to buffy exiting the warehouse, pausing at the bottom of the stairs, looking shell-shocked. spike bursts out, passes her and turns back.
spike: i thought you should know-
scene direction: buffy lifts her head and gives him a fierce look. spike looks startled. she runs past him and away, down the alley. spike looks disappointed.
scene change: cut to inside the warehouse. riley comes rushing down the stairs, buttoning his shirt. vamp #2 intercepts him, grabbing his shirt.
vamp 2: was that the slayer? what the hell do you think you're doing bringing the slayer here?
riley: back off, man. i didn't know.
vamp 2: nobody's gonna risk coming here now!
riley: i said back off!
scene direction: vamp 2 punches riley in the stomach. riley punches him in the face and he goes down. riley runs out as vamp 1 helps vamp 2 up.
scene change: cut to exterior of the summers house, night.
scene change: cut to interior of buffy's room. she enters, closes the door and leans against it, frowning, still looking shocked.
scene change: fade to riley entering his own apartment, which is dark. he closes the door and sighs, moves inside and turns on a lamp. behind him we see graham and major ellis, and another commando. riley doesn't turn around.
riley: get out.
ellis: i need to talk to you.
scene direction: riley turns to face them
riley: i'm not in a talkin' mood.
ellis: then listen.
scene direction: ellis walks toward him. graham follows
graham: riley, just give the man a chance. you don't like what you hear, we'll be on our way.
riley: talk fast.
ellis: we have a code one in belize. a demon tribe is taking apart missionaries in the rain forest down there.
riley: and you're telling me this because?
ellis: we're going down to terminate their operation. we want you to join us.
scene direction: riley looks from one to the other, then away.
scene direction: riley quietly
riley: i'm a civilian.
ellis: you're a soldier.
riley: i quit the government a long way back.
ellis: we're not government. we're army.
graham: just like you.
scene direction: ellis moves closer to riley
ellis: it's not the initiative, finn. we don't do experiments. none of us give a damn what makes monsters tick. we just stop 'em.
riley: what do you need me for?
ellis: i think you can handle yourself. and i always need bodies. i'm not gonna lie to you. it's the real deal. high risk, low pay, and seriously messy. we ship out for central america tomorrow midnight. now maybe civilian life is working out for you...
scene direction: ellis riley looks down
ellis: and maybe not. midnight. tomorrow. the decision's yours.
scene direction: the commandos leave, as riley ponders the offer.
scene change: cut to magic shop, day. giles is hanging up a large banner that reads - don't forget! winter solstice hanukkah christmas kwanzaa & [something obscured by giles's arm] are coming!
scene direction: we see xander, anya, and willow behind the counter unpacking merchandise.
giles: and so it begins.
scene direction: he steps down from his footstool and we see that the last holiday listed is 'gurnenthar's ascendance'.
giles: no longer a victim of crass holiday commercialization, i'm ... a purveyor of it.
scene direction: anya takes a jar out of a box. willow moves out from behind the counter.
anya: oh. who ordered more chickens' feet? the ones we have aren't moving at all.
xander: that's generally what happens when you cut them off the chicken.
anya: i'm serious.
scene direction: anya opens jar
anya: maybe we could do a ... holiday promotion.
scene direction: anya takes out a chicken foot
anya: one free with every purchase!
scene direction: anya smiles
giles: oh, yeah.
scene direction: giles nostalgically
giles: dear holiday memories. merry tykes by the fire, enjoying their new christmas ... chicken feet.
scene direction: willow comes up beside giles, on the opposite side of the counter from anya.
willow: aw, holding them tight as they fall asleep. painting their little toenails.
scene direction: willow and giles laugh. xander grins. anya grins too, though she is not amused.
anya: that's so very humorous. make fun of the ex-demon! i can just hear you in private.
scene direction: anya talks to the chicken foot
anya: 'i dislike that anya. she's newly human and strangely literal.'
scene direction: willow frowns
willow: anya, i don't say that. no one says that. no one talks that way.
anya: there's nothing wrong with my idea anyway. i've been very good for this store.
scene direction: anya frowns
anya: if it wasn't for me, giles would be a terrified old man staring at a quarterly tax statement and wetting himself.
scene direction: giles insulted
giles: i say, that's an exaggeration.
willow: anya, you've helped out a lot, but i have too.
scene direction: anya opening another jar
anya: yes, i forgot about all the vigorous sitting around.
xander: anya, you can back off a little. you get paid. willow's doing this on her own time.
scene direction: willow smiles and nods triumphantly.
scene direction: anya with a fake smile
anya: i'm sorry, willow. thank you for making time in your busy life to come in here and get in the way of mine.
scene direction: xander annoyed
xander: anya, play nice.
anya: you know, fine, take her side instead of mine
scene direction: anya xander sighs, puts his hands over his face
anya: even though i'm the one who sleeps with you and feeds you, bathes you...
scene direction: willow frowns.
scene direction: willow to xander
willow: she bathes you?
xander: only in an erotic, penthouse-y way, not in a sponge-bath-y geriatric sort of...
scene direction: giles puts up a hand
giles: please! stop, i beg of you.
scene direction: they all look up as the door opens (it has bells that jingle when it moves) and buffy enters. she has a bag over her shoulder. she strides purposefully over to the counter.
buffy: i need to find out everything i can about a vamp nest downtown.
giles: a nest? what sort of-
buffy: there were people there. it, um, it looked like they were paying vampires to bite them.
scene direction: giles looks shocked.
xander: *now* i know what to get for the person who has everything!
willow: who would pay to get bitten?
anya: oh, that's been going on for centuries. humans hire vampires to feed off them, they, well, you know, they-they get off on the rush.
giles: and the ... hazards of the underworld can become addictive to ... some people.
xander: why don't the vampires just kill 'em?
anya: because they get cash, hot and cold running blood, and ... they don't leave any corpses behind so they don't get hunted.
giles: but still, i-it can be terribly dangerous for humans. i mean, people can end up dying accidentally, or, or meeting a, a vampire who only pretends to play by the house rules.
scene direction: buffy angrily
buffy: you knew about this and you didn't tell me?
giles: i hadn't seen it since my ripper days. i had no idea it was going on in sunnydale.
buffy: well, it is.
scene direction: buffy giles frowns
buffy: and i'm gonna stop it.
scene direction: she turns toward a large trunk and opens it, revealing a stash of weapons.
giles: buffy, even if i had known about this, i might not have told you right now.
scene direction: buffy whirls around.
buffy: what? why?
giles: well, i'm not sure this is where your efforts are best spent. perhaps you should focus on ... a less ambiguous evil. glory, for instance?
buffy: you said people are dying.
giles: they're willing victims. i mean, there are people out there who deserve your help who aren't.
buffy: vampires are vampires. and my job description is pretty clear.
scene direction: buffy they all look uneasy
buffy: are you coming with me or not?
xander: what's the rush, buff? if we're going into a nest, maybe we should come up with a strategy. wait for riley.
scene direction: buffy scowls in extreme displeasure.
buffy: back me up or not. i'm going.
scene direction: she stalks out. giles looks conflicted, but he and xander begin to collect their things.
giles: anya, will you mind the store?
scene direction: anya nods. the others gather up jackets and stakes, and leave. anya watches them go with a smile.
anya: have a nice day! don't get killed.
scene direction: the bell jingles as they exit.
scene change: cut to inside the warehouse. buffy and giles are coming down the interior stairs.
buffy: i don't understand. this place was doing serious business last night.
scene direction: we see that the place is deserted. willow and xander are on the main floor. a small grill sits on a table, with a fire burning in it.
xander: well, i guess everybody jumped ship once the word got out that the slayer found their crib.
scene direction: xander pauses
xander: i just want to apologize for the use of the word 'crib.'
scene direction: buffy to giles
buffy: do you think they'll set up shop again in town?
giles: it's hard to say. i'm sure they'll lie low for a bit.
buffy: but they're around somewhere. there's gotta be a way to find these creeps.
willow: don't worry, buff, you'll find them.
xander: yeah, i'm sure you'll get them next time, champ.
scene direction: buffy does her angry expression again. she grabs the grill and throws it against a wall. the fire begins to spread. buffy stalks out as the others stare at her. willow follows in her footsteps. xander and giles follow more slowly, looking concerned.
scene change: cut to spike sitting in his armchair in his crypt, holding a bottle of alcohol. he pulls out the cork, sighs, and lifts the bottle to take a swig. the door bursts open and riley enters.
spike: what took you?
scene direction: spike puts the cork back in and sets the bottle aside
spike: guess it takes a while to get back to full strength after those bites.
scene direction: riley grabs spike by the shirt and pulls him up out of the chair.
spike: hey! hey, let's be reasonable about this.
scene direction: riley slams him up against a pillar.
riley: you may have noticed, spike,
scene direction: riley punches spike in the face
riley: i left reasonable about three exits back.
spike: look, i'm not the one who got you into this. don't kill the messenger.
scene direction: riley scowls. he pulls back his arm and we see there's a stake in his hand. he plunges it into spike's chest. spike gasps.
riley: why the hell not?
scene direction: blackout.
scene change: *** act iii ***
scene direction: fade back in on riley holding the stake in spike's chest.
scene direction: spike yelling
spike: ow! bloody hell! oh god!
scene direction: spike quieter
spike: hey.
scene direction: he looks down at his chest as he realizes he hasn't been dusted yet. riley yanks the stake out. spike grabs his chest in pain, and stares at the stake.
riley: plastic wood-grain. looks real, doesn't it?
scene direction: riley grabs spike's shirt again
riley: don't think i don't know what's goin' on with you, spike.
scene direction: riley they glare at each other
riley: stay away from her. or we'll do this for real next time.
scene direction: he pats spike on the cheek and walks away. spike leans against the pillar panting. he's still clutching his chest, but he begins to chuckle, and riley turns back.
scene direction: spike chuckling
spike: oh, man. you are really under it, aren't you?
scene direction: riley angrily
riley: what?
spike: look at you. all afraid i'm hot for your honey.
scene direction: riley walks back toward spike
riley: because you are.
spike: well ... yeah. but that's not your problem. even if i wasn't in the picture, you're never gonna be able to hold onto her.
scene direction: riley puts his hand over spike's hand that is covering the wound. he pushes his hand deeper into it.
spike: ow, bloody hell!
riley: maybe i didn't almost kill you enough.
scene direction: spike in pain
spike: come on. you're not the long haul guy and you know it.
riley: shut up.
spike: you know it. or else you wouldn't be getting suck jobs from two-bit vampire trulls.
scene direction: riley looks annoyed, lets go of spike. spike continues panting.
spike: the girl needs some monster in her man ... and that's not in your nature...
scene direction: spike he pushes away from the pillar, still holding his chest, and goes to sit in his chair
spike: ...no matter how low you try to go.
scene direction: spike sits back with an expression of pain. riley paces around restlessly. spike reaches for his bottle and begins to remove the cork again.
riley: you actually think you've got a shot with her?
spike: no, i don't.
scene direction: spike removes cork
spike: fella's gotta try, though. gotta do what he can.
scene direction: spike drinks
spike: riley: if you touched her... you know i'd kill you for real.
spike: i had this chip outta my head, i'da killed you long ago.
scene direction: spike replaces cork
spike: ain't love grand?
scene direction: spike tosses the bottle to riley, who catches it and removes the cork again. he sits on a nearby coffin and takes a sip.
scene direction: spike quietly
spike: sometimes i envy you so much it chokes me.
scene direction: spike they exchange a look
spike: and sometimes i think i got the better deal.
scene direction: spike sighs
spike: to be that close to her and not have her. to be all alone even when you're holding her. feeling her, feeling her beneath you. surrounding you. the scent ...
scene direction: spike louder
spike: no, you got the better deal.
scene direction: riley looks over at spike, takes another drink.
scene direction: riley bitterly
riley: i'm the lucky guy.
scene direction: riley shakes his head
riley: yeah.
scene direction: long shot of the two of them sitting together. riley tosses the bottle back to spike.
riley: i'm the guy.
scene direction: spike takes another swig. they sit there together.
scene change: cut to buffy in her workout room, beating on a punching bag. she grunts angrily and scowls as she punches over and over.
scene change: cut to the main room of the magic shop. anya is going over paperwork behind the counter. xander stands on the other side of the counter looking toward the back room.
xander: how long has she been in there?
anya: a while now. seems pretty gung-ho about it too. didn't even stop to say hello.
xander: yeah, when we went to deal with that vampire nest, she got all rambo and torched the place.
scene direction: xander anya looks up
xander: something seriously bad is going on with her.
anya: oh, i don't know, maybe you're overreacting. i mean, who hasn't done stuff like that from time to time? i mean, i made this one guy spontaneously combust,
scene direction: anya the doorbell jingles
anya: and he set his whole village on fire.
scene direction: we see riley entering.
xander: can you stop being scary for a minute and listen to what i'm trying to tell you?
scene direction: riley approaches and xander turns to face him. riley nods toward the back.
riley: she in there?
xander: she's training.
scene direction: riley nods
riley: would you guys mind clearing out? i need a minute alone with her.
scene direction: xander nods, goes to get his jacket.
scene direction: anya to riley
anya: a little after-hours hanky-panky in the training room, huh?
scene direction: anya she comes out from behind the counter as riley walks toward the back
anya: boy, xander and i could tell you some stories...
xander: not now. let's go, anya.
scene direction: xander he and anya begin walking out
scene direction: anya calling over her shoulder
anya: there's a funny thing with the vaulting horse that you can tr...
xander: anya!
anya: what? he started it.
xander: in your world, maybe, but where the people are, this isn't the time for 'tales of anya and xander's sexcapades.'
anya: oh.
scene direction: anya stops walking and turns to him
anya: uh, well, maybe we can go home and, you know, have 'em.
xander: actually, i've got some stuff to take care of.
scene direction: he walks past her and opens the door to leave. anya follows him.
scene change: cut to buffy still punching. riley walks in behind her.
riley: we need to talk.
scene direction: buffy continues punching
buffy: i'm not ready to talk to you yet.
scene direction: riley walks forward, removing his jacket and tossing it aside.
riley: too bad.
scene direction: he takes hold of the punching bag. buffy stops punching.
buffy: i'm serious.
scene direction: buffy turns away
buffy: unless you wanna fight.
riley: so let's fight. we need to have this out, buffy. right now.
scene direction: buffy turns back, annoyed.
buffy: and say what, riley? 'what were you thinking? how long have you been lying to me?' nothing you say right now is gonna make this better.
scene direction: she turns away again. riley moves forward.
riley: i realize that.
scene direction: riley grabs her arm and turns her around
riley: i don't expect...
scene direction: riley angrily
riley: i just need you to hear me out.
scene direction: buffy quietly
buffy: fine. get your hand off of me.
scene direction: he lets go of her arm, sighs, walks a few steps away.
riley: i think, when this thing started, it was just some stupid, immature game. i wanted to even the score after you let dracula bite you.
buffy: i did not *let* dracula-
riley: i know. on some level i know that. but i was still spun.
scene direction: riley pause
riley: i don't know, i - i wanted to know what you felt. i wanted to know why dracula and angel have so much power over you.
scene direction: buffy shakes her head
buffy: you so don't get it.
riley: i wanted to get it, buffy. i wanted to get you.
buffy: so this is my fault? hey, gee, buffy's so mysterious, i think i'll go out and almost die. i think i'll go and let some other w...
scene direction: buffy she stops and looks down.
riley: this isn't your fault. it's mine. i feel like hell for what i've put you through.
scene direction: riley buffy still doesn't look at him
riley: it's just...
scene direction: riley sighs
riley: these girls-
buffy: vampires. killers.
riley: they made me feel something, buffy. something i didn't even know i was missing until-
buffy: i can't. i can't hear this.
scene direction: she turns away again and riley grabs her arm again.
riley: you *need* to hear this.
scene direction: buffy pulls her arm away, walks a few steps away.
buffy: fine. fine! tell me about your whores! tell me what on earth they were giving you that i can't.
riley: they needed me.
buffy: they needed your money. it wasn't about you.
scene direction: riley walks closer to her
riley: no. on some basic level it *was* about me. my blood, my body.
scene direction: riley sighs
riley: when they bit me ... it was beyond passion. they wanted to devour me, all of me.
scene direction: buffy teary
buffy: why are you telling me this?
riley: it wasn't real. i know, it was just physical. but the fact that i craved it ... that, that i kept going back ... even if it was fleeting, they made me feel like they had such... hunger for me.
buffy: and i don't ... make you feel that way?
scene direction: buffy riley looks away
buffy: how on earth can you compare me to that? how can you tell me you understand what those vampires are feeling? you aren't a passion to them, you are a snack! a willing, idiotic snack.
scene direction: riley angrily
riley: no, i know exactly what they feel when they bite me, because i feel it every time we're together. it's like the whole world falls away. and all there is is you.
buffy: and you think that i don't feel the same way about you? how dare you tell me what i feel?
riley: you keep me at a distance, buffy. you didn't even call me when your mom went into the hospital.
scene direction: buffy incredulously
buffy: oh, i'm sorry. you know, um, i'm sorry that i couldn't take care of you when i thought that my mother was dying.
riley: it's about me taking care of you! it's about letting me in. so you don't have to be on top of everything all the time.
buffy: but i do. that's part of what being a slayer is.
scene direction: buffy shakes her head
buffy: and that's what this is really about, isn't it? you can't handle the fact that i'm stronger than you.
riley: it's hard sometimes, yeah. but that's not it.
buffy: then what? what else do you want from me, riley? i've given you everything that i have, i've given you my heart, my body and soul!
riley: you say that, but i don't feel it. i just don't feel it.
buffy: well, whose fault is that? because i'm telling you, this is it, this is me. this is the package. and if it's so deficient that you need to get your kicks elsewhere ... then we really have a problem.
scene direction: they both stare at each other silently for a moment. then buffy looks down. riley sighs.
riley: they want me back, buffy ... the military.
scene direction: riley buffy looks up in shock
riley: it's deep undercover, no contact with civilians. transport's leaving tonight.
buffy: tonight? when were you gonna tell me about this?
riley: i'm telling you now.
buffy: are you going?
riley: i don't know. if we can't work this out...
buffy: then what? this is goodbye?
scene direction: buffy riley shrugs. buffy gets mad.
buffy: you are unbelievable. you're giving me an ultimatum?
riley: no, i'm not.
buffy: yes you are! you expect me to get over it now or you're gone!
riley: i don't, buffy, that's not what i meant.
buffy: well, i have heard enough.
scene direction: buffy angrily
buffy: i will not take the blame for this.
scene direction: buffy starts to walk away.
riley: i'm not asking you to.
scene direction: riley grabs her arm yet again
buffy: let go of me!
scene direction: buffy pulls her arm away
riley: or what? you'll hit me?
scene direction: riley she stares at him. he spreads his arms out.
riley: go ahead. come on, do it.
buffy: get out of my way.
riley: i'm serious, buffy, hit me. hit me.
scene direction: he walks right up to her. she walks around him and takes her jacket off a hook.
riley: i'm leaving, buffy.
scene direction: she stops walking but doesn't turn to face him. he turns to speak to her back.
riley: unless you give me a reason to stay ... i'm leaving tonight.
scene direction: buffy opens the door and walks out, closing it behind her. riley looks upset.
scene change: cut to buffy walking through dark alleys. suddenly vamp #2 and another vamp appear behind her. buffy slows, then stops and turns to face them.
vamp 2: the pyro act was a bad idea, slayer.
buffy: felt pretty good to me.
vamp 2: i'm not running. and you're not shutting me down.
scene direction: more vampires appear, surrounding buffy. overhead shot of her looking around as they form a loose circle around her. there are about ten of them in total.
vamp 2: in fact ... you're not gonna make it through the night. blackout.
scene change: *** act iv ***
scene direction: fade back in on buffy surrounded by vamps. she looks at them, and speaks to vamp 2.
buffy: walk away.
scene direction: buffy vamp 2 moves closer
buffy: i'm serious. don't do this. not now.
scene direction: vamp 2 lunges at her and she shoves him. he flies backward into some large tubes. the other vamps attack.
scene direction: buffy backhands vamp 3, kicks vamp 4 in the face, spins around to punch vamp 5. then vamp 4 attacks her with a long staff. she punches him in the face, takes the staff and uses it to stake vamp 6 behind her. she hits vamp 4 in the face with the staff, dusts vamp 7, punches vamp 8, and quickly dusts three more vamps with three quick jabs of the staff. she pauses and faces down vamp 2. he runs at her, and as he flies over her head she stakes him. she turns and puts the staff to the throat of the last vamp, a woman, who stands still looking scared.
scene direction: brief shot of riley being bitten from earlier in the episode, as buffy realizes the vamp she now faces is the one who was drinking from riley.
scene direction: buffy slowly lowers the staff. the vampire looks surprised, then turns and begins to run away down the alley.
scene direction: buffy stands there looking thoughtful. after a moment she lifts the staff and throws it like a javelin. it flies down the alley and dusts the female vamp as she's running.
scene direction: buffy stands there staring down the alley. someone comes up behind her.
xander: so, how'd that work out for ya?
scene direction: buffy turns to see xander emerging from the shadows.
xander: make you feel better?
buffy: what are you doing here?
xander: i thought you might need to talk. then i saw the skirmish happen. i was gonna lend a hand, but i noticed you grew a few extra ones.
scene direction: buffy angrily
buffy: go home, xander.
scene direction: she turns and starts to stride away.
xander: buffy.
scene direction: buffy turns back
buffy: i'm serious!
xander: so am i. something's up. you're acting like a crazy person.
scene direction: buffy turns and begins walking away again. xander follows.
scene direction: buffy pushes aside a large metal door and enters a random building. xander enters after her.
scene change: cut to interior of another warehouse. boxes and metal cans are stacked neatly on metal shelving. buffy walks over to a set of shelves backed by a metal grating and leans her face against it. xander walks in behind her.
xander: take this, for instance. you don't wanna deal, so you hide? it's not very slayer-like.
buffy: just leave me alone, xander. you have no idea what's going on.
xander: no? good, so you and riley *aren't* imploding?
scene direction: xander buffy turns to face him in surprise
xander: it doesn't take a genius. what i can't figure out is how you never saw it coming.
buffy: what? who told you?
xander: nobody told me anything, buffy. it was right in front of my xander face. the guy would do anything for you.
buffy: the guy got himself bit by a vampire!
scene direction: buffy xander is surprised
buffy: he lied to me. he ran around behind my back and almost got himself killed! and now he tells me that he's leaving with some covert military operation at midnight unless *i* convince him not to. now tell me that you understand. because i sure as hell don't.
xander: you gonna let him go?
scene direction: buffy sighs
buffy: it's not my decision to make.
xander: of course it is.
buffy: well, it's not fair.
xander: who cares if it's fair? in about twenty minutes, riley's gonna disappear, maybe forever, unless you do something to stop him.
buffy: what am i supposed to do? beg him to stay?
scene direction: xander in disbelief
xander: why wouldn't you? to keep riley here-
buffy: i don't even know who he is anymore. i mean, i thought he was ... dependable.
xander: dependable? what is he, state farm?
buffy: you know what i mean.
xander: yeah. i think you mean convenient. i think you took it for granted that he was gonna show up when you wanted him to, and take off when you didn't.
buffy: look who's talking. look who has anya following him around like a lovesick puppy.
xander: oh boy, is this *not* about me.
buffy: is she more than a convenience? 'cause that would kinda be a surprise.
scene direction: xander angrily
xander: if you don't wanna hear what i have to say, i'll shut up right now.
buffy: good, 'cause i don't.
scene direction: she starts to walk off. xander intercepts her.
xander: i lied. see, what i think, you got burned with angel, then riley shows up.
buffy: i know the story, xander.
xander: but you miss the point. you shut down, buffy. and you've been treating riley like the rebound guy. when he's the one that comes along once in a lifetime.
scene direction: xander buffy looks dismayed
xander: he's never held back with you. he's risked everything. and you're about to let him fly because you don't like ultimatums?
scene direction: buffy's eyes begin to water as xander's words finally get through.
xander: if he's not the guy, if what he needs from you just isn't there,
scene direction: xander shakes head
xander: let him go. break his heart, and make it a clean break. but if you really think you can love this guy ... i'm talking scary, messy, no-emotions-barred need ... if you're ready for that ... then think about what you're about to lose.
scene direction: buffy looks up at him, then looks around anxiously. there are tears in her eyes.
buffy: xander...
xander: run.
scene direction: she turns and runs out. xander watches as the door slams behind her.
scene change: cut to buffy running as hard as she can, down the main street of sunnydale, her expression still anxious.
scene direction: shot of riley standing next to a helicopter, looking around.
scene direction: buffy runs along in the street, turns a corner and enters a more residential neighborhood.
scene direction: riley continues to look around, checks his watch. behind him the helicopter blades begin to turn slowly.
scene direction: buffy runs down quiet streets.
scene direction: riley looks at the ground, looking very disappointed. the helicopter blades move faster and faster.
scene direction: buffy runs through a foresty area and down some wooden stairs.
scene direction: riley stares at the two trees between which he wants buffy to appear. she doesn't. he turns and gets into the helicopter next to graham.
scene direction: buffy runs through the forest and comes out on the helipad. the helicopter is already off the ground and rising fast.
buffy: riley! riley!
scene direction: shot of riley inside the helicopter, staring grimly out the front window. behind him we can see out the helicopter door and we see buffy on the ground yelling up at him.
buffy: riley! riley!
scene direction: he doesn't hear her and continues to stare out the front. buffy watches as the helicopter rises and flies away.
scene change: cut to buffy walking slowly down the residential streets.
xander voiceover: i've gotta say something...
scene change: cut to anya's apartment. anya is in her nightgown, sitting on the bed.
xander: 'cause ... i don't think i've made it clear.
scene direction: anya stands up. xander walks toward her.
xander: i'm in love with you.
scene direction: he walks closer toward her, and she toward him.
xander: powerfully, painfully in love. the things you do ... the way you think ... the way you move ... i get excited every time i'm about to see you.
scene direction: they are up close now, looking at each other. anya smiles slightly, looking a little teary.
xander: you make me feel like i've never felt before in my life. like a man.
scene direction: xander pause. he shrugs uneasily
xander: i just thought you might wanna know.
scene direction: anya moves up to him and they kiss.
scene change: cut to buffy entering the dark summers house. she walks partway up the stairs and then sits down, looking sad.
scene direction: her image fades into the image of riley sitting in the helicopter with the dark town of sunnydale laid out below him.
scene direction: blackout.
scene direction: in memory of d.c. gustafson.
