buffy: we're a little ahead of schedule.
principal wood: i can't say i'm too surprised. i knew i signed on for something, but, buffy, i'm just a guy. granted, a cool and sexy vampire-fighting guy, but still.
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: don't forget "snappy dresser."
scene direction: principal wood smiles

buffy: what is it?
principal wood: an emergency kit. this bag belonged to my mother.
buffy: a slayer keepsake. i-i couldn't.
principal wood: well, you have to. technically, it should have been passed down directly to you through the years, but after my mother died... i guess i just couldn't part with it.
buffy: wow!
principal wood: i don't know what's inside, exactly, but i know it has something to do with her power. well, your power now.
buffy: i-i don't know what to say.
principal wood: try saying, "thank you, principal wood."
buffy: thank you, principal wood.
scene direction: principal wood grins

buffy: andrew, we don't have a big board.
scene direction: andrew runs to fetch a white dry-erase board from behind the chair
andrew: i, uh, made it myself.
scene direction: the board is approximately 2' x 4', and is labeled sunnydale "big board". using every color of marker, the board features a hand-drawn map of sunnydale, with representations of trees, cemeteries, railroad tracks, and the street grid.

chloe: 20 what?
scene direction: kennedy in her face
kennedy: push-ups, maggot!

scene direction: kennedy to wood
kennedy: hi.
scene direction: kennedy hands on her hips again
kennedy: who the hell are you?
buffy: an ally.
kennedy: so, what do you think? my girls ready to kick some ass, or what?
principal wood: looking strong.
kennedy: but...?
principal wood: well, i'm just not sure the first has an ass that you can actually, you know, kick.
scene direction: kennedy smirks
kennedy: guess we'll see.
scene direction: amanda waving
amanda: principal wood, hi! it's so weird seeing you outside of school.
scene direction: kennedy to amanda
kennedy: what are you waving at, potential? attention!
potentials: huh!
kennedy: rising sun. begin.
scene direction: kennedy they continue their training as buffy and wood talk
buffy: you're right, it's not enough.
principal wood: that's not what i said, buffy. it's an impressive group of recruits.
buffy: they're not recruits. recruits are...recruited. these girls were chosen.
principal wood: you're doing the best you can with what you've got.
buffy: they're not all gonna make it. some will die, and nothing i can do will stop that.
scene direction: willow walks out the back door onto the porch, arms full of weapons. she freezes when she sees principal wood.
willow: oh, hi. hey. well, buffy, i—i see that our preparation for the school-pep-dance-cheer-drill contest are coming along.
scene direction: willow to the potentials
willow: bring it on!
buffy: it's ok, i filled him in on everything.
scene direction: willow lets out a sigh of relief
willow: oh, thank god! if i had to explain all these weapons, i had nothing.
scene direction: willow puts down the weapons
principal wood: buffy tells me you have been, um—oh, how shall i put it—experimenting.
scene direction: principal wood willow's eyes grow wide; she casts a "you said what?" glance at buffy
principal wood: with the magicks.
scene direction: willow laughs nervously
willow: oh! yeah. oh, nothing too heavy, though. just the lighter, safer stuff. uh, if kennedy asks, her pointy stuff's right there. see you inside.
scene direction: willow to buffy
willow: so much cooler than snyder.
principal wood: she really almost destroyed the world?
scene direction: buffy nods
buffy: yep.
principal wood: remind me not to make her crabby.
buffy: it might be better if you did.
principal wood: how's that work?
buffy: oh, i don't know. it's just—the first is coming, and then look at us: the army. we've got a bunch of fighters with nothing to hit, a wicca who won't-a, and the brains of our operation wears oven mitts.
principal wood: hm. well, you're redefining the job, buffy, and that takes guts. this isn't your full arsenal anyway. show me the vampire.
scene direction: cut to 25 int. basement at buffy's house - day
scene direction: anya and spike are talking in the basement.
anya: but you just let him go.
spike: after saving your life.
anya: for now. that was one of d'hoffryn's killers, spike. he won't stop coming 'til he kills me.
spike: yet here you are, walking, talking, annoying.
anya: but you fought like such a wimpire, what with the lifting and the running. why not just kill him?
scene direction: buffy and principal wood walk downstairs into the basement while anya and spike are talking.
spike: anya, think. i fight, demon boy gets lucky, i get knocked out, you get killed. true?
scene direction: spike anya thinks, starts to speak, rolls her eyes
spike: we both know the safest and sanest way of saving your life was to keep you with me, away from danger.
scene direction: spike anya grunts, shakes her head and walks away
spike: no need to thank me. i'm just the one who beat him off.
scene direction: spike looks at buffy
spike: repelled him would perhaps be the better phrase.
scene direction: spike buffy nods
spike: demon.
buffy: figured.
scene direction: principal wood from across the room, not facing spike
principal wood: i hope we're not intruding.
spike: not a bit. and just what brings our good principal to this neck of the gloom?
buffy: i'm showing him our operation. us.
spike: fine by me.
scene direction: spike nods
spike: big fight against evil coming up. the more good guys we've got, the longer we'll all live.
scene direction: principal wood still not facing spike
principal wood: is that what you are? a good guy?
scene direction: spike turns from buffy toward wood
spike: i haven't heard any complaints. well, i have heard a few complaints over the years, but then i just killed whoever spoke up, and that was pretty much that.
scene direction: spike woods turns to face spike
buffy: he's joking.
scene direction: principal wood glaring at spike
principal wood: no, he's not.
scene direction: spike looking at wood
spike: no, i'm not.
scene direction: spike softly
spike: but...that's the old me i'm talking about.
principal wood: why don't you tell me about that?
spike: not much to tell. i've changed.
principal wood: oh, now that you have a soul.
scene direction: principal wood nods
spike: yeah. that was a big deal. very... private.
scene direction: spike hurt, to buffy
spike: what, are you just telling everyone now?
principal wood: oh, come on, spike. don't blame buffy. i asked.
scene direction: principal wood walks toward spike
scene direction: spike walks toward wood
spike: right, the educator.
scene direction: spike facing each other now, only a few feet apart
spike: yeah, i went to great lengths. lots of trouble, and now i'm unique. well, more or less. got myself a soul, whatever that means.
principal wood: and how's that working out for you?
spike: in progress.
principal wood: well, you've had some time. you've been in sunnydale, what...?
spike: years.
principal wood: how many?
spike: a few.
principal wood: before that?
spike: around.
scene direction: spike spike's gritting his teeth, huffing, pursing his lips as wood needles him
scene direction: buffy stepping up, nearly in between them
buffy: i think we'd better get back upstairs.
scene direction: spike staring at wood, talking cockily in his face
spike: right. give him the full tour. you don't want to miss a look at her weapons' chest.
scene direction: buffy walks upstairs; wood follows.
scene direction: cut to 25 int. upstairs at buffy's house - day
scene direction: buffy's setting up sleeping bags and pillows in dawn's room while talking to dawn.
dawn: so, i took a look inside that emergency bag of principal wood's.
buffy: and?
dawn: smelled weird. kinda like grandma's closet, but worse.
buffy: i didn't know what was possible. anything we could use?
dawn: trinkets, weapons, one very large textbook.
scene direction: dawn picks up the book, flips through it
dawn: translation's gonna be a bitch, but... do you know that ancient sumerians do not speak english?
scene direction: buffy scoffs
buffy: they're worse than the french. anything else?
dawn: uh, yeah. a box. a big, fat, unopenable box. i'm betting whatever the big deal about this emergency bag is, you'll find it in the box.
scene direction: dawn puts the book down
buffy: good. keep on it.
scene direction: buffy walks out of the room
buffy: don't you have any real homework?
scene direction: dawn following buffy
dawn: oh, you mean, like, schoolwork?
buffy: yes.
dawn: well, i've got a system. it's called flunking out.
scene direction: dawn giggles
dawn: no, just kidding. i'm paying someone to do my work.
scene direction: dawn squeals
dawn: i'm kidding. i love to see your eyeballs change color when you think i'm gonna flunk out of—
scene direction: dawn gasps
scene direction: dawn has followed buffy down the hall into another bedroom where they find chloe hung from a bed sheet from the ceiling.

scene change: *** act ii ***
scene direction: cut to 26 int. upstairs at buffy's house - day
scene direction: resume. buffy and dawn are staring, stunned, as chloe's body hangs from the ceiling by a bed sheet twisted around her neck. kennedy, rona, and amanda come out of the bedroom across the hall and join buffy and dawn.
kennedy: what happened? we heard—
scene direction: kennedy gasps and covers her mouth
buffy: dawn, get a knife. we're cutting her down.
scene direction: first [chloe] from out of nowhere, chloe/first appears, standing beside chloe's hanging body
first [chloe]: good thinking. but, on the other hand, why rush? up or down, i'll still be dead.
buffy: you're not chloe.
first [chloe]: yeah, well, neither is she, anymore. now, she's just chloe's body.
kennedy: what did you do to her?
first [chloe]: nothing! we just talked all night. well, i did most of the talking, but chloe is...i'm sorry, was a good listener. 'til she hanged herself.
scene direction: first [chloe] to kennedy
first [chloe]: like when you called her maggot—she really heard that.
buffy: don't listen to it, any of you. it's the first.
first [chloe]: oh, let 'em. the only reason why chloe offed herself is 'cause she knew what you're not getting. i'm coming, you're going. all this—it's almost over.
buffy: we'll be here.
first [chloe]: all of you? but wait. i thought—
scene direction: first [chloe] changing her voice to sound like buffy
first [chloe]: they're not all gonna make it. some will die, and there's nothing i can do that will stop it.
scene direction: first [chloe] in chloe's voice now
first [chloe]: hey, i didn't say it. but i'll be seeing all of you. one by one. ttfn.
scene direction: first [chloe] disappears in a flash of light
buffy: what's ttfn?
rona: it's "ta ta for now." it's what tigger says when he leaves.
amanda: chloe loved winnie the pooh.
buffy: dawn, where's that knife?
scene direction: cut to 27 ext. field somewhere in sunnydale - night
scene direction: someone's digging in the earth with a shovel. it's buffy, digging in an empty field near a tree. she digs, wiping her brow, then continues digging.
scene direction: cut to 28 int. living room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: everyone in the house is gathered into the living room for a meeting. the mood is somber as everyone sits in silence, except for the soft sobbing sounds as they mourn chloe's death. there's approximately ten potentials in the room, plus willow, dawn, anya, xander, and spike. buffy comes into the room carrying the shovel.
buffy: is everyone here?
scene direction: kennedy sighs
kennedy: all accounted for.
buffy: anyone want to say a few words about chloe?
scene direction: buffy silence
buffy: let me.
scene direction: buffy paces
buffy: chloe was an idiot. chloe was stupid. she was weak. and anyone in a rush to be the next dead body i bury, it's easy. just...think of chloe, and do what she did. and i'll find room for you next to her and annabelle. i'm the slayer. the one with the power. and the first has me using that power to dig our graves.
scene direction: buffy throws down the shovel angrily
buffy: i've been carrying you—all of you—too far, too long. ride's over.
scene direction: kennedy stands
kennedy: you're out of line!
willow: no, she's not.
scene direction: kennedy to willow
kennedy: you're gonna let her talk to you like that? willow, she's not even the most powerful one in this room. with you here, she's not close.
buffy: you're new here, and you're wrong. because i use the power that i have. the rest of you are just waiting for me.
xander: well, yeah, but only because you kinda told us to. you're our leader, buffy, as in "follow the."
buffy: well, from now on, i'm your leader as in "do what i say."
xander: ja wohl! but let's not try to forget, we're also your friends.
anya: i'm not.
buffy: then why are you here? aside from getting rescued, what is it that you do?
anya: i provide much-needed... sarcasm.
scene direction: xander raises hand
xander: um, that would kinda be my job, actually.
buffy: you're here because you're scared.
xander: same goes for everyone in this room.
buffy: fine. anya, all of you, be as scared as you'd like, just be useful while you're at it.
willow: come on, buffy. you know everyone here's doing everything they can.
buffy: the first isn't impressed. it already knows us. it knows what we can do, and it's laughing. you want to surprise the enemy? surprise yourselves. force yourself to do what can't be done, or else we are not an army—we're just a bunch of girls waiting to be picked off and buried.
scene direction: buffy spike stands and walks toward the door
buffy: where are you going?
spike: out. since i'm neither a girl, nor waiting. all this speechifying doesn't really apply to me, does it?
scene direction: spike walks away
scene direction: buffy calls after him
buffy: fine. take a cell phone. that way, if i need someone to get weepy or whaled on, i can call you.
scene direction: spike turns to buffy
spike: if you've got something to say—
buffy: just said it. you keep holding back, you might as well walk out that door.
spike: holding back? you're blind. i've been here, right in it—fighting, scrapping...
buffy: since you got your soul back?
spike: well, as a matter of fact, i haven't quite been relishing the kill the way i used to.
buffy: you were a better fighter then.
spike: i did this for you. the soul, the changes—it's what you wanted.
buffy: what i want is the spike that's dangerous. the spike that tried to kill me when we met.
scene direction: spike angrily
spike: oh, you don't know how close you are to bringing him out.
buffy: i'm nowhere near him. dawn, get the potentials upstairs, and break out that emergency kit.
dawn: what are you gonna do?
buffy: i'm declaring an emergency.
scene direction: buffy walks out past spike without acknowledging him
scene direction: cut to 29 int. living room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: principal wood sets down the slayer's emergency kit next to buffy.
buffy: we thought you'd want to be here.
principal wood: yeah, you thought right.
scene direction: dawn kennedy, willow, anya, and xander go through the contents of the bag
dawn: that emergency bag's got some neat stuff in it. weapons, charms,
scene direction: dawn holds up the book
dawn: advanced reading assignments.
xander: yeah, cool stuff, but we've seen it all before.
scene direction: anya points to the box
anya: well, not this, we haven't. what's inside it?
principal wood: mm, i don't know. it hasn't been opened since—
scene direction: principal wood buffy breaks off the lock with her bare hands
principal wood: well, since now.
scene direction: xander pulls out metal figures from the bag
xander: puppets. that's it! the first hates puppets! now if we can just airlift kermit, fozzie the bear, and miss piggy into town, the first'll be a-running.
willow: those are muppets.
scene direction: dawn takes the figure from xander
dawn: and these things are shadow-casters. you put them in motion, and they tell you a story.
scene direction: dawn references the book
dawn: it says you can't just watch, you have to see.
anya: what the hell does that mean?
xander: it's cryptic. i don't like it. every time instructions get cryptic, someone gets hurt—usually me.
buffy: you can't just watch, you have to see?
scene direction: buffy to principal wood
buffy: see what?
dawn: that's where all my fancy translating skills break down, but i think it's an origin myth. the story of the very first slayer.
buffy: i-i saw her.
principal wood: you saw the first slayer?
buffy: the other night—in my dream. it's gotta mean something, right?
scene direction: cut to 30 int. living room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: in the darkened room, xander strikes a match and lights the wick at the center of a metal mechanical object. the light fills the room, revealing dawn, who's holding a large book open in her arms.
dawn: ok. according to this, i think—you put on those puppet guys one by one. they cast shadows and the shadows tell the story. first, there is the earth.
scene direction: xander puts the first metal figure on the mechanical object. the light at the center casts a shadow of the figure on the wall. a tribal drumbeat can be heard in the background.
kennedy: what's that sound?
xander: ok, so far, so creepy.
dawn: hmm. ok.
scene direction: as dawn narrates the story, xander puts the corresponding shadow caster figure on the device -
scene direction: as xander adds the figures to the shadow caster, sounds are also added to the magical soundtrack -
dawn: then, there came the demons.
scene direction: a representation of a demon and growling sounds.
dawn: after demons, there came men.
scene direction: a representation of men and chanting sounds.
dawn: men found a girl.
scene direction: a representation of a girl and a girl's scream.
dawn: and the men took the girl to fight the demon—all demons. they—they chained her to the earth.
scene direction: a representation of a chain.
dawn: and then—and i—i can't read this. something about darkness.
scene direction: the shadow casting device starts spinning on its own.
buffy: what about darkness?
scene direction: the shadow caster device is spinning, making shadows of the figures on the walls, but the shadows are animated, moving, acting out the story.
dawn: it says you cannot be shown. you cannot just watch, but you must see. see for yourself, but only if you're willing to make the exchange.
xander: when did you get so good at sumerian?
dawn: it's not in sumerian anymore.
scene direction: dawn the words on the pages of the book are magically changing into english
scene direction: willow and kennedy stand, alarmed, as the shadow casters tell a story of a demon attacking the chained girl. the device spins faster and faster as the shadows move up the walls. suddenly, a bright blue light forms at the center of the device, growing in size until it forms a window of light. buffy walks closer to investigate it.
xander: but what does it mean?
buffy: it means i have to go in there.
scene direction: willow panicky
willow: no, it doesn't! where does it say that? it doesn't say that!
principal wood: buffy, you don't even know what you're exchanging. you don't know if you're ready yet.
buffy: that's the point.
willow: no. buffy, we don't know where you're going or how we'll get you back.
xander: buffy, you can't.
willow: how will we get you back?
buffy: find a way.
scene direction: buffy jumps through the window of light; the portal closes behind her
willow: she's gone.
xander: huh.
anya: what was that about an exchange?
scene direction: there's a flash of light, and then a large, growling demon appears.
xander: ah, this must be the exchange student.
scene direction: the demon grabs xander by the shirt collar and throws him across the room, breaking furniture as he lands.
scene change: fade to black.
scene change: *** act iii ***
scene direction: cut to 31 int. living room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: resume. the demon has thrown xander to the ground. anya, kennedy, willow, spike, and principal wood are standing there in shock as the growling demon now turns its attention to them.
kennedy: willow! use your magic. send him back!
willow: um, trying. redi!
scene direction: the demon backhands willow, sending her across the room. wood pulls out throwing stars and hurls them at the demon. then he engages the demon in hand-to-hand combat until the demon finally pushes him to the ground.
kennedy: weapons.
scene direction: dawn hands kennedy a sword, while also taking one for herself. kennedy charges at the demon, whaling on it with the sword; dawn follows suit with her sword. the demon fights the girls, but they are no match for it. it punches kennedy, sending her across the room. just then, spike jumps on the demon's back.
spike: get out of here—all of you. unless you want to end up all dead and useless.
scene direction: kennedy from the couch where she sits, injured
kennedy: what are you gonna do?
spike: what i do best.
scene direction: spike slams the demon's head into the wall, but it turns the tables on him, throwing him so hard into the ceiling that he breaks through it and lands on the floor upstairs. the demon breaks through the closed french doors, smashing glass as he leaves the house. willow sits up where she'd fallen. xander also tries to stand. principal wood helps anya stand.
scene direction: dawn to kennedy, who's inspecting her bloody hand
dawn: are you injured?
kennedy: just hurt. don't make a case out of it.
scene direction: kennedy to xander and willow
kennedy: how 'bout you?
xander: i think we'll live.
scene direction: anya looks at the ceiling
anya: except maybe spike.
kennedy: is getting thrown through the ceiling what he does best?
scene direction: dawn sighs
dawn: i'll go check on him.
anya: we've got bigger problems than that.
principal wood: yeah, demon loose; no slayer.
willow: we need buffy.
xander: you gotta get her back. looks like it's spell'o'clock.
anya: which spell? i mean, didn't you see that thing? and you expect to reopen the portal without sending willow off the deep end?
scene direction: willow frowns, nods
willow: thanks for your support.
anya: well, it's true. we're going to have to find another way.
scene direction: willow shakes her head
willow: there isn't, and buffy knew it. i've got to get her back.
kennedy: we don't even know where she went.
scene direction: cut to 32 ext. desert - day
scene direction: buffy tumbles through the portal and finds herself in the desert. it looks like where she had gone once before with giles on the spiritual retreat. the lighting is strange, as if brightness and contrast have been turned super-high, giving the scene a supernatural feel.
buffy: well, guess that worked.
scene direction: she hears chanting nearby and goes to investigate.
scene direction: cut to 33 int. downstairs at buffy's house - night
scene direction: dawn's holding the book from the slayer's emergency kit. willow, kennedy and xander are gathered around her in the living room.
xander: dawnie, what's the book say?
dawn: not much. once buffy left, it got a little tougher to read.
scene direction: dawn holds up the book to show the writing has changed
willow: oh.
scene direction: willow walks out of the room to the kitchen; the others follow
kennedy: it's ok. we'll just start with what we know, and take it from there.
xander: great, so far we know jack about squat. let's go from there.
kennedy: you've got the magic, use it.
willow: i-i-i don't even know what magic to use.
kennedy: why not just try all 32 flavors. worst thing that happens is you go brunette.
scene direction: willow grabs first-aid kit from kitchen cabinet
willow: that's not the worst thing that can happen.
scene direction: willow attends to kennedy's wounded hand
anya: she's right. and you know we have a choice. we can risk willow's life and the rest of our lives to get buffy back, or we leave her out there.
principal wood: if we play it safe back here, buffy could stay lost.
anya: you missed her "everyone sucks but me" speech. if she's so superior, let her find her own way back.
xander: anya, the first is already up and running. every second that buffy's not here, is an opportunity for it to show up and rip us to pieces.
dawn: willow, how would you get buffy back?
willow: that's what i'm saying—i don't even know.
dawn: ok, but if another witch was to do it, where would she start?
willow: uh, physics, principles, basic laws...
dawn: such as?
willow: uh, conservation of energies. you can't really create or destroy anything, only transfer.
scene direction: anya scoffs.
dawn: i'm sorry, are you helping?
anya: no, but at least i'm not galloping off in the wrong direction.
willow: magic works off physics.
anya: not without a catalyst. if you're talking about transferring energies, you need some kind of conduit.
willow: like a-a kraken's tooth.
anya: yeah, skin of draconis, um, ground up baltic stones, something...
dawn: ok. good.
kennedy: plus, we need an exchange, like you said. i'm thinking a slayer for a demon.
principal wood: right. if we want buffy back, then we have to find that demon and send it through.
kennedy: it matter if it's dead or alive?
scene direction: spike standing in the doorway now
spike: i vote dead. the slayer's counting on you, willow. get cracking on that portal, and don't be stingy with the mojo. the demon's mine.
kennedy: hate to say it,
scene direction: kennedy makes quotes with her hands
kennedy: "big bad," but you look like you can barely stand. we're trained. and the only thing we know for sure about this demon is it kicked your ass.
scene direction: spike smirks
spike: it did, at that.
scene direction: spike walks toward the door
principal wood: where are you going?
spike: something i need.
scene direction: spike leaves through the kitchen door
scene direction: cut to 34 ext. desert - day
scene direction: buffy walks up to a group of three men dressed in tribal fashion, each holding a tall staff and wearing different colored head-dresses.
buffy: hello? i'm buffy. i'm the slayer.
scene direction: the men are speaking some unrecognizeable language.
red hat shadow man: subtitle: we know who you are.
black hat shadow man: subtitle: and we know why you're here.
brown hat shadow man: subtitle: we've been waiting.
scene direction: buffy nods
buffy: good. that's good then. um, you know, i know we have bigger issues to deal with, but how'd i understand anything you guys just said?
scene direction: buffy they look at each other and stand, not answering
buffy: oh, i know, ancient magicks. i just thought it was neat.
red hat shadow man: subtitle:
scene direction: red hat shadow man the three men start circling buffy
red hat shadow man: we have been here since the beginning.
black hat shadow man: subtitle: now, we are almost at the end.
buffy: the neat of it just left. end of what?
brown hat shadow man: subtitle: you are the hellmouth's last guardian.
buffy: latest. you mean latest guardian.
red hat shadow man: subtitle: no.
buffy: ok, um, i have a first to fight, ok. so just tell me what i need to know. i came to learn.
red hat shadow man: subtitle: we cannot give you knowledge. only power.
buffy: you know what i think? i'm not really here at all. none of this is actually happening. this is like a play. like some shadow-play. some non-reality re-enactment hologramy—
scene direction: one of the men hits buffy, knocking her over—she falls to the ground.
scene direction: cut to 35 int. living room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: willow's pouring green sand from a bag, creating a circle with the sand. kennedy, dawn, xander and anya are also in the room.
kennedy: and this is gonna help us how?
dawn: the sand forms a circle. the circle acts as a barrier. and the barrier contains the portal.
kennedy: now what? we hold hands and chant kumbaya or something?
scene direction: willow hands the bag of sand to kennedy
willow: maybe. 'til we get the magicks up and running, i'm kinda working on my best guess here.
xander: will, maybe we should wait.
kennedy: for what?
xander: spike—to see if he can bring back that demon.
willow: no, i don't think we should wait right now. opening a portal this size could take days.
kennedy: better get started.
scene direction: willow holds her hands in fists and shifts her weight from one foot to another
willow: i think i might pee my pants.
kennedy: you can do it—the magicks, not the pants thing.
willow: ok.
scene direction: willow breathes deeply, then sits down in the middle of the circle
willow: via temporis, iam clamo ad te, via spatii te jubeo aperire. aperi!
scene direction: willow nothing happens; willow turns to dawn
willow: dawnie, you'd better put on some coffee. this could take awhile—
scene direction: willow's interrupted by a flash of light. energy radiates through the room, knocking everyone down. willow's eyes turn black, and she screams like a banshee.
scene direction: cut to 36 ext. cave in desert - day
scene direction: buffy's groggy and disoriented as she regains consciousness. she's sitting on the ground.
buffy: what is this?
scene direction: buffy stands only to find she is shackled at the wrists and chained to the ground. she struggles against the chains. the three men are standing in front of her in a circle.
brown hat shadow man: subtitle: we are at the beginning. the source of your strength. the well of the slayer's power.
red hat shadow man: subtitle: this is why we have brought you here.
buffy: i thought i brought me here. listen, you guys. i'm already the slayer, bursting with power. really don't need any more.
red hat shadow man: subtitle: the first slayer did not talk so much.
scene direction: buffy pulls on her chains again. the men start tapping their staves against the ground, rhythmically. the man in the red hat fetches a box and brings it to the center of the circle, where he takes off the box top.
red hat shadow man: subtitle: herein lies your truest strength.
black hat shadow man: subtitle: the energy of the demon. its spirit.
brown hat shadow man: subtitle: its heart.
buffy: this is how you—
red hat shadow man: subtitle: created the slayer?
scene direction: red hat shadow man nods
red hat shadow man: yes.
scene direction: black smoke comes out of the box in long tentacles; it seems sentient as it dances around the circle. the men keep tapping their staves rhythmically.
brown hat shadow man: subtitle: it must become one with you.
buffy: no!
scene direction: buffy struggles against her chains
red hat shadow man: subtitle: this will make you ready for the fight.
buffy: by making me less human?
red hat shadow man: subtitle: this is how it was then. how it must be now.
black hat shadow man: subtitle: this is all there is.
scene direction: buffy struggles against her restraints in vain as the black smoke comes toward her, entering her body through her nose and ears.
scene change: fade to black.
scene change: *** act iv ***
scene direction: cut to 37 ext. cave in desert - day
scene direction: resume. buffy's screaming as the black smoke tries to enter her body. the men just stand there, watching. the smoke can't get in through her head while she's screaming, so it rises to the ceiling of the cave and comes back down to her, encircling her hips. still, she resists.
scene direction: buffy through gritted teeth
buffy: make this stop!
red hat shadow man: subtitle: this is what you came for.
buffy: no, this isn't the way.
red hat shadow man: subtitle: do not fight this.
scene direction: the black smoke heads toward buffy again.
scene direction: cut to 38 int. basement at sunnydale high - night
scene direction: spike's in the school basement, rifling through boxes until he finally finds what he's looking for—his old leather duster. he holds it up, shakes it out, and puts it on. he walks out with his characteristic swagger from before he got the soul.
scene direction: cut to 39 int. hallway at sunnydale high - night
scene direction: wearing the duster, spike walks down the hallway toward the exit. he passes principal wood, who's standing in a doorway.
principal wood: where you going?
scene direction: spike without missing a beat
spike: got a job.
principal wood: nice coat. where'd you get it?
scene direction: spike walks by wood without looking at him or stopping
spike: new york.
scene direction: wood watches spike walk away.
scene direction: cut to 40 int. living room at buffy's house - night
scene direction: willow's sitting in the circle, black-eyed, and performing magic. the others behind her stand up from where they had fallen earlier.
willow: via, concursus, tempus, spatium, audi me ut imperio. screw it! mighty forces, i suck at latin, ok? but that's not the issue. i'm the one in charge, and i'm telling you open up, portal, now!
xander: it's not happening, will.
kennedy: give her time. she's getting it.
xander: or something's getting her. will, think you better back up a little.
willow: no!
scene direction: willow's arms thrust back behind her, sending magic toward anya and kennedy, who immediately freeze. enveloped in magic, they are lifted from the ground momentarily by willow, who's pulling power from the two women, through her, to create the portal. the portal opens up in front of her in the shape of a large window of light. noticing that willow's hair turned black as she channeled anya and kennedy's energy, xander enters the circle, lifting willow up by her arms. as he carries her out of the circle, her hair goes back to red. kennedy seems upset as she realizes what just happened.
scene direction: cut to 41 ext. alley in sunnydale - night
scene direction: in vamp visage, wearing his leather duster, spike's fighting the demon from the portal.
spike: oh, come on now, nancy. call yourself a demon? i thought you were up for a proper fight.
scene direction: spike the demon punches spike, knocking him down
spike: now we're talking.
scene direction: spike stands and tackles the demon, head butting it. the demon then punches spike repeatedly, ultimately pinning him against a wall. spike then pushes the demon's head away, and kicks it across the alley.
scene direction: spike laughing maniacally
spike: yeah!
scene direction: cut to 42 ext. cave in desert - day
scene direction: buffy's still chained to the ground as she stands, addressing the three men who put her there.
buffy: you think i came all this way to get knocked up by some demon dust? i can't fight this. i know that now. but you guys? you're just men.
scene direction: buffy rips her chains out of the ground
buffy: just the men who did this...to her. whoever that girl was before she was the first slayer.
red hat shadow man: subtitle: you don't understand.
buffy: no, you don't understand! you violated that girl, made her kill for you because you're weak, you're pathetic, and you obviously have nothing to show me.
scene direction: buffy uses the chains that are still shackled to her hands as weapons. she swings the chains, at the legs of one man, and the staff of the other. she knocks them down, but they get up again. a fight ensues.
scene direction: cut to 43 ext. alley in sunnydale - night

scene direction: spike in vamp visage, spike takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth
spike: i don't know your feelings, big guy, but to me, a tussle like that...
scene direction: spike strikes a match on the demon's ear, brings the match up to his cigarette; spike's now in human face
spike: is good for the soul.
scene direction: spike spike lights his cigarette and takes a puff
scene direction: cut to 44 ext. desert - day
scene direction: after defeating two of the men, buffy walks up to the man in the red hat, holding a staff. she breaks it, and the demon smoke disappears.
