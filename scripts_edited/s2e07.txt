scene direction: angel suddenly steps between her and the boy.
scene direction: angel to the boy, sternly
angel: run home.

drusilla: your heart stinks of her.
scene direction: drusilla puts her hand on his chest
drusilla: poor little thing.

scene direction: buffy looks over the edge and sees them standing close together. she can overhear.
angel: this can't go on, drusilla. it's gotta end.
scene direction: she tilts her head and reaches up for a kiss.
drusilla: oh, no, my pet. this is just the beginning.
scene direction: she pulls away without kissing and gives him an evil smile. she keeps her head turned to him as she slowly walks away. buffy swallows at what she sees. angel watches drusilla go for another moment, then turns to leave also. buffy steps away from the edge of the roof and runs off.
scene direction: opening credits roll. buffy's theme plays.
scene change: *** part 1 ***

jenny: it's a secret!
scene direction: cut inside. jenny and giles come down the stairs.
giles: what kind of a secret?
jenny: uh, the kind that's secret. you know, where i don't actually tell you what it is.
giles: i think it's customary that when two people are going out on an evening that they, they both have an idea of where they're going.
jenny: oh, come on! where is your sense of adventure?
giles: well, i, i... uh, how will i know what to wear?
scene direction: jenny looks at his tweed suit
jenny: do you own anything else?
giles: uh, w-well, not as such, no, um...
scene direction: jenny laughs
jenny: rupert, you're gonna have to trust me.
giles: alright, alright, i p-put myself in your hands.
jenny: that sounds like fun.
scene direction: jenny starts on her way
jenny: okay, tomorrow night, 7:30, right?
giles: yes.
scene direction: buffy comes up to him as jenny leaves.
buffy: hey.
giles: hello.
scene direction: giles they start to the library
giles: um, did we hunt last night?
buffy: i did a couple quick sweeps downtown.
giles: any encounters?
buffy: nothing vampirey.
giles: uh, i've been researching your friend spike. uh, the profile is fairly unappetizing. but i-i still haven't got a bead on why he's here.
buffy: you'll figure it out.
giles: you alright? you seem a little glum.
buffy: i'm fine.
scene direction: they stop outside the library.
giles: why don't you take the night off?
buffy: okay. that'd be nice.
giles: yes. you could spend some time with angel.
buffy: i don't know. he might have other plans.
scene direction: she walks off to class. giles wonders what that was all about.
scene change: cut to class. buffy opens a note from willow.
note: do you know who she was?
boy: well, it seems like louis xvi was just sort of a weak king.
scene direction: buffy and willow glance at each other. buffy starts to write an answer to the note.
teacher: that's fair enough. uh, any other impressions?
scene direction: the camera pans forward to cordelia sitting in front of buffy. xander is across from her in front of willow, and looks over at cordelia with his head propped up on his fist.
cordelia: i just don't see why everyone's always picking on marie antoinette. i can so relate to her. she worked really hard to look that good, and people just don't appreciate that kind of effort.
scene direction: buffy has finished her answer to willow's note.
answer: no dark hair old dress pretty cordelia: and i know the peasants were all depressed...
xander: i think you mean 'oppressed'.
cordelia: whatever. they were cranky.
scene direction: buffy folds the note and hands it back to willow.
cordelia: so they're, like, 'let's lose some heads'. uhhh! that's fair. and, and marie antoinette cared about them. she was gonna let them have cake!
scene direction: the camera pans over to willow finishing another note.
teacher: yes, well, that's a very interesting perspective.
scene direction: willow hands buffy the note.
teacher: um, would anyone else like to comment?
scene direction: buffy opens the note.
note: vampire?

willow: angel and a girl.
buffy: willow, do we have to be in total share mode?
xander: hey, it's me. if angel's doing somethin' wrong, i wanna know. 'cause it gives me a happy!
scene direction: xander smiles

xander: moping at the bronze.
scene direction: he sits on a couch next to willow. ford walks up the steps behind buffy.
ford: i'd suggest a box of oreos dunked in apple juice, but maybe she's over that phase.
scene direction: buffy uncrosses her arms and turns around.
buffy: ford?
ford: hey, summers!

ford: dad got the transfer, and boom, he just dragged me outta hemery and put me down here.
buffy: this is great! well, i mean, it's hard, sudden move, all your friends, delicate time, very emotional, but let's talk about me!
scene direction: buffy puts her hand on his knee
buffy: this is great!
scene direction: willow smiles
willow: so, you two were sweeties in fifth grade?
buffy: not even. ford wouldn't give me the time of day.
ford: well, i was a manly sixth-grader. i couldn't bother with someone that young.
buffy: it was terrible. i moped over you for months. sitting in my room listening to that divinyls song 'i touch myself'.
scene direction: she realizes how what she just said could be taken and casts a nervous look at xander and willow.
buffy: of course, i had no idea what it was about.
scene direction: ford nervously scratches his temple with his finger. xander just smiles and nods.
scene direction: buffy to ford
buffy: hey, are you busy tonight? we're going to the bronze, it's the local club, and you have to come.

buffy: ford! you made it.
ford: wasn't hard to find.
willow: buffy, ford was just telling us about the ninth grade beauty contest, and the, uh, swimsuit competition.
buffy: oh, my god, ford, stop that! the more people you tell, the more people i have to kill.
ford: you can't touch me, summers. i know all your darkest secrets.
xander: care to make a small wager on that?
buffy: i'm gonna go get a drink. ford, try not to talk.

ford: uh, okay.
scene direction: ford heads back
buffy: good. run! thanks!
scene direction: he starts to jog. a second later she starts running in the opposite direction and around the corner. ford looks back and stops when he sees she's gone. he can hear a woman crying. he starts to walk back. when he's almost there a woman comes running around the corner and past him.
scene direction: he continues on, and is startled by a metal trashcan flying in front of him and into a stack of crates. he can hear punching and grunting. he sees someone hit the pavement face first. he peeks around the corner and sees a vampire get up and take a swing at buffy. she ducks the punch and kicks the vampire in the face. the vampire swings again, and buffy grabs his fist and holds on while she punches him in the face. ford watches as she pulls out a stake and thrusts it into the vampire's chest. he staggers back into the wall and explodes into ashes.
ford: what's goin' on?
scene direction: buffy is surprised and spins around to face him.
buffy: um... uh, there was a, a cat. a cat here, and, um, then there was a-another cat... and they fought. the cats. and... then they left.

angel: just don't bring it up until we know what's what.
willow: okay. i-it's probably nothing.
angel: that'd be nice.
scene direction: she closes the door and frets a bit, nervous about what she has to do.

buffy: willow!
scene direction: willow doesn't even press the button on the fountain before immediately turning around, hoping to get away. she realizes she'd never be able to get away with it, and so turns to face them. she fidgets nervously with her hands.

ford: okay. dull's good.
scene direction: ford sees two vampires running
ford: or maybe not so dull.
scene direction: ford buffy sees them, too
ford: is that more vampires?
buffy: must be the weather.
scene direction: she pulls out a stake and a cross, and hands the cross to ford. he takes it and reaches into his back pocket to pull out a stake of his own. he smiles and waves it about.
buffy: stay close to me.
scene direction: she hops up the steps the vampires just ran up and cautiously looks around. ford is close behind, cross and stake held ready. she looks around a corner and sees nothing.
ford: maybe they were just passing through.
scene direction: buffy turns around
buffy: i don't think so.
scene direction: a blonde female vampire grabs her from behind and tries to bite. ford takes a startled step back. buffy does a high kick into her face, then grabs her by the arm and flips her over onto her back. a male vampire rushes her and grabs her, pulling her over a railing with him. she lands in a crouch on the grass below and gets up while the vampire rolls to his feet. she kicks him in the jaw, making him fall backward. ford looks down at his stake and cross and then glances at the fight a moment before quickly approaching the other vampire and holding the cross in her face and the stake up and ready. she hisses at him.
ford: you've got one chance to live. tell me what i wanna know, and i'll let you go.
scene direction: below buffy knocks the vampire out with a punch to the face and stakes him. she runs back up the stairs to ford, who's crouched where the vampire was.
buffy: where's the other one?
ford: i killed her.
scene direction: ford coughs
ford: i, i killed her and she just turned to dust. it was... amazing!
scene direction: buffy raises her eyebrows in surprise.
scene change: cut to xander, willow and angel walking down the alley to the sunset club.
willow: the only thing i could track down was this address. the sunset club. still didn't find anything incriminating.
angel: he leaves no paper trail, no records, that's incriminating enough.
xander: yeah, i'm gonna have to go with dead boy on this one.
angel: could you *not* call me that?
scene direction: he knocks on the door. the viewport opens and the doorman looks out.
angel: we're friends of ford's.
scene direction: the doorman nods. cut inside. they walk in through the inside door and look around. it's gloomy in the extreme.
scene direction: willow wearing a colorfully striped shirt
willow: boy, we blend right in.
xander: in no way do we stick out like sore thumbs.
angel: let's look around. you guys check out downstairs.
xander: sure thing, bossy the cow!
scene direction: xander they start down
willow: okay, but do they really stick out?
xander: what?
willow: sore thumbs. do they stick out? i mean, have you ever seen a thumb and gone, 'wow! that baby is sore!' xander: you have too many thoughts.
scene direction: willow is a bit hurt by that. angel looks down from the balcony and continues around. "reptile", by creaming jesus, is playing.
lyrics: the one hungry life / my life with the other.
scene direction: willow and xander walk by a man standing in a coffin dressed as a movie vampire.
scene direction: man waves

willow: as in 'vampires! yay!'?
xander: that's the one.
scene direction: chantarelle gets up and comes up behind them.
chantarelle: you guys are newbies. i can tell.
scene direction: willow turns to face her
willow: oh, no. we come here all the time.
chantarelle: don't be ashamed! it's cool that you're open to it. we welcome anyone who's interested in the lonely ones.
scene direction: angel comes down the stairs behind them.
willow: the lonely ones?
angel: vampires.
xander: oh! we usually call them the nasty, pointy, bitey ones.
chantarelle: so many people have that misconception. but they who walk with the night are not interested in harming anyone. they are creatures above us. exalted!
angel: you're a fool.
scene direction: xander gives him a look.
chantarelle: you don't have to be so confrontational about it. other viewpoints than yours may be valid, you know.
scene direction: chantarelle goes away
willow: nice meeting you.
scene direction: they turn to angel.
xander: you really are a people person.
willow: now nobody's gonna talk to us.
angel: i've seen enough. i've seen this type before. i mean, they're children making up bedtime stories of friendly vampires to comfort themselves in the dark.
willow: is that so bad? i mean, the dark can get pretty dark. sometimes you need a story.
angel: these people don't know anything about vampires. what they are, how they live, how they dress...
scene direction: a young man dressed exactly like angel comes down the stairs behind him and looks him up and down before continuing on. angel clears his throat.
scene direction: they start up the stairs to get out of the club.
xander: you know, i love a good diatribe. but i'm still curious why ford, the bestest friend of the slayer, is hanging with a bunch of vampire wannabes.
willow: something's up with him, you're right about that.
scene direction: diego overheard them and watches them go. the girl talking to him is confused about his reaction.
girl: are you okay?
scene change: cut to the library. buffy comes in followed by jenny and giles.
buffy: sorry to beep you guys in the middle of... stuff, but it seemed really weird.
giles: no, you did the right thing. absolutely.
scene direction: jenny stops in her tracks
jenny: you hated it that much?
giles: no! but, but, uh, vampires on campus is, could have implications. very, very grave...
jenny: you coulda just said something.
giles: uh, honestly, i, i've always, i've always been interested in, in, uh, monster trucks.
buffy: you took him to monster trucks?
jenny: i thought it would be a change!
giles: it was a change.
jenny: look, we could've just left.
giles: wha-what, and miss the nitro-burning funny cars? no, couldn't have that.
buffy: okay, can we get back on the vampire tip here? these guys were here with a purpose.
giles: yes, yes, and, uh, we must, uh, ascertain what that purpose is.
jenny: where's your friend?
buffy: i sent him home.
scene direction: giles sits at the table
giles: oh, uh, good. yes, the less he's involved in all this, the safer he'll be.
buffy: he did bag a vamp his first time out.
scene direction: giles takes an open book from on top of another and exposes an old picture of drusilla.
buffy: gotta give him credit for...
scene direction: buffy notices the picture
buffy: that.
jenny: something wrong?
scene direction: buffy picks up the picture
buffy: who's this?
giles: um, she's called drusilla, a sometime paramour of spike's. she was killed by an angry mob in prague.
buffy: well, they don't make angry mobs like they used to, 'cause this girl's alive. i saw her with angel.
scene direction: giles taken aback
giles: with angel?
jenny: isn't he supposed to be a good guy?
scene direction: buffy puts the picture back down
buffy: yeah. he is.
jenny: i think maybe we need to read up on this nice lady.
scene direction: giles gets up and heads for his office
giles: well, some of my new volumes may be more helpful. uh, my own research is...
scene direction: the blonde vampire runs into him as she runs from his office. jenny draws a startled breath. buffy comes to giles' aid, but is knocked to the floor underneath him when the vampire gives him a hard shove. she jumps up onto the table and leaps over the mezzanine railing, making her escape through the stacks. jenny helps giles and buffy up.
jenny: are you guys okay?
giles: a book! it took one of my books!
jenny: well, at least someone in this school is reading.
buffy: he said he killed it. that's the vampire ford said he killed.
scene change: cut to spike's warehouse. drusilla is talking to her bird as the camera pans around the cage.
drusilla: you sing the sweetest little song. won't you sing for me, hmm? don't you love me anymore?
scene direction: the bird is lying dead at the bottom of the cage. spike comes into the room behind drusilla.
spike: darling! i heard a funny thing just now. lucius tells me that you went out on a hunt the other night.
drusilla: my tummy was growly. and you were out.
scene direction: drusilla to the bird
drusilla: come on.
scene direction: drusilla whistles

drusilla: angel.
spike: yeah. so...
scene direction: spike kisses her forehead
spike: what might you guys have talked about, then? old times? childhood pranks? it's a little off, you two so friendly, him being the enemy and all that.
scene direction: drusilla to the bird
drusilla: i'll give you a seed if you sing.
spike: the bird's dead, dru. you left it in a cage, and you didn't feed it, and now it's all dead, just like the last one.
scene direction: drusilla cowers and whines.
spike: oh, i'm sorry baby. i'm a bad, rude man. i just don't like you goin' out, that's all. you are weak.
scene direction: spike takes her hand
spike: would you like a new bird? one that's not dead?
scene direction: spike sucks on her finger
ford: this is so cool!
scene direction: spike looks up to see him standing among some crates.
ford: i would totally live here.
scene direction: spike loudly
spike: do i have anyone on watch here? it's called security, people. are you all asleep?
scene direction: spike walks toward ford
spike: or did we finally find a restaurant that delivers?
ford: i know who you are.
spike: yeah, i know who i am, too. so what?
ford: i came looking for you, spike. you are spike, right? william the bloody?
spike: you've got a real death wish. it's almost interesting.
scene direction: the blonde vampire comes in, walks up to spike and hands him the book she stole. spike begins to leaf through it.
spike: oh, this is great. this'll be very useful.
scene direction: spike to ford
spike: so, how did you find me?
ford: that doesn't matter. i've got something to offer you. i-i'm pretty sure this is the part where you take out a watch and say i've got thirty seconds to convince you not to kill me?
scene direction: ford smiles
ford: it's traditional.
spike: well,
scene direction: spike slams the book and strides to ford
spike: i don't go much for tradition.
scene direction: he grabs ford by the ear and lifts him.
drusilla: wait, love.
scene direction: ford is in obvious pain, but doesn't scream. drusilla puts her hand on spikes's shoulder, and he lets go.
spike: well?
ford: oh, c'mon! say it! it's no fun if you don't say it.
spike: what? oh.
scene direction: spike rolls his eyes and bobs his head
spike: you've got thirty seconds to convince me not to kill you.
ford: yes! see, this is the best! i wanna be like you. a vampire.
spike: i've known you for two minutes, and i can't stand you. i don't really feature you livin' forever.
scene direction: spike to drusilla
spike: can i eat him now, love?
scene direction: drusilla shakes her head.
ford: well, feature this: i'm offering you a trade.
scene direction: ford spike turns back
ford: you make me a vampire, and i give you the slayer.
scene direction: ford has their undivided attention. spike smiles.
scene change: *** part 3 ***
scene direction: the kitchen at the summers house. buffy is nursing a cup of coffee.
scene direction: angel slowly pushes the door open.
angel: buffy. may i come in?
scene direction: buffy looks up
buffy: sure. i thought once you were invited you could always just walk in.
angel: i can. i was just being polite.
scene direction: angel closes the door
angel: we need to talk.
buffy: do we?
scene direction: buffy picks up her coffee and heads into the dining room
angel: it's about your friend ford. he's not what he seems.
buffy: who is these days?
angel: willow ran him down on the computer.
buffy: willow?
angel: we found this address, we checked it out with xander, and it turned out...
scene direction: buffy disbelieving
buffy: and xander? wow. everybody's in. it's like a great big exciting conspiracy.
angel: what are you talking about?
buffy: i'm talking about the people i trust. who's drusilla?
scene direction: angel lowers his eyes, seeing he's been caught in a lie.
buffy: and don't lie to me. i'm tired of it.
angel: some lies are necessary.
buffy: for what?
angel: sometimes the truth is worse. you live long enough, you find that out.
buffy: i can take it. i can take the truth.
angel: do you love me?
buffy: what?
angel: do you?
scene direction: she takes a moment to consider her answer.
buffy: i love you. i don't know if i trust you.
angel: maybe you shouldn't do either.
scene direction: angel turns away
buffy: maybe i'm the one who should decide!
angel: i did a lot of unconscionable things when i became a vampire.
scene direction: angel turns back, but doesn't make eye contact
angel: drusilla was the worst. she was... an obsession of mine. she was pure and sweet and chaste...
buffy: and you made her a vampire.
angel: first i made her insane.
scene direction: angel looks at her
angel: killed everybody she loved. visited every mental torture on her i could devise.
scene direction: angel buffy looks away
angel: she eventually fled to a convent, and on the day she took her holy orders, i turned her into a demon.
buffy: well. i asked for the truth.
angel: ford's part of some society that reveres vampires. practically worships them. i don't know what he wants from you, but you can't trust him.
scene change: fade to black. cut to school the next day. buffy walks up some stairs to the quad. ford meets her there. the camera circles them as they talk.
ford: buffy!
buffy: ford.
ford: i had a great time last night. well, an interesting time.
scene direction: buffy arms crossed
buffy: i'm glad.
ford: do you wanna go out again tonight?
buffy: not busy.
ford: i sort of had an idea. it's a... it's a secret. kinda wanna surprise you.
buffy: i like surprises.
ford: can you meet me here?
buffy: sure.
ford: at nine?
buffy: at nine.
scene direction: ford smiles
ford: it's gonna be fun!
scene direction: ford walks off
scene direction: buffy just stands there for a moment before uncrossing her arms and continuing on her way.
scene change: cut to later at the stairs in the hall. xander and willow are sitting on the steps. buffy comes down behind them.
scene direction: willow gets up
willow: buffy!
scene direction: buffy doesn't really want to face her, but does.
willow: did, uh, angel...
buffy: he told me everything.
willow: i'm sorry we kept stuff from you.
buffy: it's okay.
scene direction: buffy smiles weakly
willow: when angel came to my room he was just really concerned for you, and we didn't wanna say anything in case we were wrong.
xander: did you find out what ford is up to?
buffy: i will.
scene direction: buffy walks off
scene direction: willow and xander sadly watch her go. after a moment something clicks in xander's head.
xander: angel was in your bedroom?
scene direction: willow nods
willow: ours is a forbidden love.
scene change: cut to the sunset club. chantarelle is sitting and drumming her fingers.
scene direction: diego paces nervously. the camera pans up to ford coming down the stairs.
scene direction: ford ignoring diego
ford: chantarelle. is everything ready?
diego: of course. it's ready.
scene direction: diego trying to get ford's attention
diego: hi, i took care of it. i always take care of it.
chantarelle: is it time? tonight?
ford: you nervous?
scene direction: ford pours goblets of wine
chantarelle: yes. no. i'm ready for the change. do you really think they'll bless us?
scene direction: ford takes a goblet and hands her the other
ford: i know they will.
scene direction: he smiles at chantarelle. she smiles back.
ford: everything's falling into place.
scene direction: ford takes a sip of wine
diego: what about your friends? are they comin'?
ford: what are you talking about?
diego: your friends. they came. last night. two guys and a girl.
chantarelle: one was mean.
ford: oh, christ! why didn't you tell me about this?
diego: i have to do everything around here. sorry, mr. flawless plan guy, it slipped my mind.
chantarelle: it's gonna be alright, isn't it?
scene direction: ford winces in pain and puts his fingertips to his forehead.
chantarelle: they're not gonna let us down?
scene direction: ford the pain passes
ford: it's gonna be fine.
chantarelle: i need them to bless me.
ford: it's gonna be fine!
buffy: no.
scene direction: they all look at her at the top of the stairs.
buffy: it's really not.
scene direction: ford to diego
ford: it's kinda drafty in here.
scene direction: buffy starts down the stairs
buffy: i'm sorry, ford. i just couldn't wait till tonight! i'm rash and impulsive. it's a flaw.
ford: we all have flaws.
buffy: i'm still a little fuzzy on exactly what yours is. i think it has to do with being a lying scumbag.
scene direction: buffy reaches him
ford: everybody lies.
buffy: what do you want, ford? what's this all about?
ford: i really don't think you'd understand.
buffy: i don't need to understand. i just need to know.
ford: i'm gonna be one of them.
buffy: you wanna be a vampire?
ford: i'm going to.
buffy: you know, vampires are a little picky about who they change ov...
scene direction: buffy figures it out
buffy: you were gonna offer them a trade!
ford: i don't think i wanna talk anymore.
scene direction: she grabs him by the throat and shoves him up against a pillar.
buffy: yeah, well, i still feel awfully chatty! you were gonna give them me! tonight!
scene direction: ford nods
ford: yes.
buffy: you had to know i'd figure it out.
ford: actually, i was counting on it.
scene direction: ford smiles
scene direction: she lets go of his throat and backs away. he coughs a bit and then laughs.
buffy: what's supposed to happen tonight?
ford: this is *so* cool! it's just like it played in my head. you know that part where you ask me what's supposed to happen?
scene direction: ford snickers
ford: it's already happening.
scene direction: diego swings the inner door shut with a loud clang. she runs back up the stairs and pounds on the door.
ford: rigged up special. once it's closed, it can only be opened from the outside. as soon as the sun sets, they'll be comin'.
buffy: ford, if these people are still around when they get here...
scene direction: diego interrupts
diego: we'll be changed. all of us.
chantarelle: we're going to ascend to a new level of consciousness!
scene direction: become like them. like the lonely ones.
ford: this is the end, buffy. no one gets outta here alive.
scene change: *** part 4 ***
scene direction: the sunset club. buffy hurries back down the stairs.
buffy: there's gotta be another way out of here!
scene direction: buffy looks around
ford: this is a bomb shelter, buffy. i knew i wasn't gonna be able to overpower you. but this is three feet of solid concrete. trust me when i say we're in for the long haul.
buffy: at least let the other people go.
chantarelle: why are you fighting this? it's what we want!
diego: it's our chance for immortality.
chantarelle: this is a beautiful day. can't you see that?
buffy: what i see is that, right after the sun goes down, spike and all of his friends are going to be pigging out at the all-you-can-eat moron bar.
diego: okay, that's it. i think we should gag her.
buffy: i think you should try.
diego: she's an unbeliever. she taints us.
buffy: i am trying to save you! you are playing in some serious traffic here! do you understand that? you're going to die! and the only hope you have of surviving this is to get out of this pit right now, and, my god, could you have a dorkier outfit?
scene direction: diego is offended. chantarelle smiles.
ford: i gotta back her up, d. you look like a big ninny.
scene direction: ford his alarm goes off
ford: 6:27. sunset.
scene direction: they all walk away from her. she looks around for what to do next.
scene change: cut to spike's warehouse. he comes marching out with his troops.
spike: when we get there, everybody spread out. two men on the door, first priority's the slayer, everything else is fair game, and let's remember to share, people.
scene direction: spike meets drusilla 
spike: are you sure you're up for this?
drusilla: i want a treat. i need a treat.
spike: and a special one you'll have. lucius!
scene direction: spike hold up his keys
spike: bring the car around.
scene change: cut to the sunset club. buffy runs back up the stairs to the door. ford follows her.
ford: hey, you never give up, do you?
buffy: no, i don't.
ford: that's a good quality in a person. too many people, they just lay back and take it, but us...
buffy: us? we have something in common now?
ford: more than you think.
buffy: yeah, well, let me explain something to you. you're what we call the bad guy.
ford: i guess i am!
scene direction: ford chuckles
scene direction: buffy looks down at the people
buffy: these people aren't gonna get changed, are they? the rest of them, they're just fodder.
ford: technically, yes. but i'm in. i will become immortal.
buffy: well, i've got a news flash for you, braintrust: that's not how it works. you die, and a demon sets up shop in your old house, and it walks, and it talks, and it remembers your life, but it's not you.
ford: it's better than nothing.
buffy: and your life is nothing?
scene direction: ford snickers.
buffy: ford, these people don't deserve to die!
ford: well, neither do i! but apparently no one took that into consideration, 'cause i'm still dying.
scene direction: buffy begins to realize what he's up to now.
ford: i look good, don't i? well, let me tell you something:
scene direction: ford angry
ford: i've got maybe six months left, and by then what they bury won't even *look* like me. it'll be bald and shriveled and it'll smell bad. no, i'm not going out that way.
scene direction: buffy turns away.
ford: i'm sorry, summers. did i screw up your righteous anger riff?
scene direction: does the nest of tumors liquefying my brain kinda spoil the fun?
scene direction: buffy faces him
buffy: i'm sorry. i had no idea. but what you're doing is still very wrong.
ford: okay, well, you try vomiting for twenty-four hours straight because the pain in your head is so intense, and *then* we'll discuss the concept of right and wrong.
scene direction: ford points down
ford: these people are sheep. they wanna be vampires 'cause they're lonely, miserable or bored. i don't have a choice.
buffy: you have a choice. you don't have a good choice, but you have a choice! you're opting for mass murder here, and nothing you say is gonna make that okay!
ford: you think i need to justify myself to you?
buffy: i think this is all part of your little fantasy drama! isn't this exactly how you imagined it? you tell me how you've suffered and i feel sorry for you. well, i do feel sorry for you, and if those vampires come in here and start feeding, i'll kill you myself!
ford: you know what, summers? i really did miss you.
scene direction: buffy can only look at him. outside a car comes screeching to a halt.
buffy: ford, help me stop this.
scene direction: buffy silence
buffy: please!
scene direction: ford remains silent. buffy runs around to the stairs again.
buffy: people, listen to me!
scene direction: buffy ford comes after her
buffy: this is not the mothership, people! this is ugly death come to play!
scene direction: ford backhand punches her across the face, and she goes tumbling to the bottom of the steps. he comes down after her and punches her in the back as she tries to get up, sending her to the floor again. they hear the outside door open and look up. chantarelle starts up the stairs to meet them. ford checks to see that buffy is still out cold on the floor.
scene direction: chantarelle reaches the top of the steps as the inner door opens. spike walks up to her in his game face and smiles. he roars at her and she flinches a bit but doesn't back down. he tears the choker off of her neck. she starts to cry in fear.
spike: take them all. save the slayer for me.
scene direction: the vampires run and jump down the stairs to the people below and begin feeding. spike grabs chantarelle by the neck and bites her violently.
scene direction: buffy wakes and gets up, and ford tries to hit her with a crowbar. she grabs his arm in mid-swing and pulls him around, making him hit his head on a concrete pillar. he falls unconscious to the floor. she looks at the mayhem going on around her and spots drusilla standing by herself on the balcony. she takes a running leap off of a couch up to the balcony railing, quickly climbs over, grabs drusilla from behind and holds a stake to her chest.
buffy: spike!
scene direction: spike stops feeding on chantarelle and looks over at them. drusilla stares at the stake poised in front of her.
spike: everybody stop!
scene direction: they all stop feeding.
buffy: good idea. now you let everyone out, or your girlfriend fits in an ashtray.
scene direction: drusilla frightened
drusilla: spike?
spike: it's gonna be alright, baby. let them go!
scene direction: they all let go of their victims, and the people hurry up the stairs and out.
buffy: down the stairs.
scene direction: spike slowly backs down the stairs. buffy forces drusilla ahead of her, still holding the stake ready. when buffy reaches the top of the stairs she stares at spike for a moment. she looks at drusilla and shoves her down the stairs at spike. he catches and steadies her as buffy turns and rushes out the door. he starts to give chase as buffy swings the door shut behind her. spike slams up against it. he looks for the way to open it.
spike: uh, where's the doorknob?
scene change: cut to the alley. buffy walks out of the building and sees the people help and support each other. angel walks up to her and willow and xander are close behind.
buffy: you guys are just in time.
willow: are there vampires?
buffy: they're contained. they'll get out eventually, though. we should probably go. we can come back when they're gone.
xander: come back for what?
scene direction: buffy looks back at the entrance
buffy: for the body.
scene direction: cut inside the club. the vampires are banging on the doors. ford wakes and gets up, holding his head. spike is comforting drusilla.
ford: what happened?
spike: we're stuck in a basement.
ford: buffy?
