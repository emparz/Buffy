scene direction: cut to 8 ext. park in new york city - night
scene direction: title - new york city, 1977
scene direction: it's pouring down rain in the middle of the night somewhere in the city. two people are fighting in the paved walkway in a park. it's a pretty rough fight. zoom in on them to show vamped spike fighting nikki. nikki kicks spike, sending him tumbling. he stands and speaks to her.
scene direction: spike exhilarated
spike: well, all right. got the moves, don't you? i'm gonna ride you hard before i put you away, luv.
nikki: you sure about that? you actually look a little wet and limp to me. and i ain't your "luv."
scene direction: nikki kicks spike and they begin fighting again. zoom in on a nearby park bench. a little boy watches them from behind the bench, peeking through the slats. spike and nikki continue to fight. spike overpowers nikki, pushing her to the ground and straddling her, punching her repeatedly in the face. nikki grabs spike's arm and kicks him off of her. the little boy is still watching them fight. nikki punches spike, but this time, he grabs her arm and twists it around so that he can almost bite her neck. alarmed, the boy stands, knocking over the trash can beside him. this startles spike, who turns to see what happened. nikki seizes the moment, and head-butts spike, freeing herself from his grip. she then elbows him, punches him, and knocks him down. when he stands, she has a stake ready and throws it at his heart. spike catches it between his palms only inches in front of his chest.
scene direction: spike grinning
spike: i spent a long time trying to track you down. don't want the dance to end so soon, do you, nikki? the music's just starting, isn't it?
scene direction: spike tosses the stake back toward her; it lands on the pavement; spike starts to walk away, but swings around on a lamp post, staring at her
spike: by the way...love the coat.
scene direction: spike walks away
scene direction: young robin from behind the bench
young robin: mamma!
scene direction: nikki goes up to robin, squats down to be on eye-level with him
nikki: you did a good job, baby boy. you stayed down just like mamma told you.
young robin: can we go home now?
nikki: uh-uh. it's not safe there anymore. how 'bout i leave you over at crowley's house, and you can play with those spooky doodads that you like.
young robin: no, i wanna stay with you.
scene direction: nikki looks back over her shoulder, then back at robin
nikki: yeah, i know you do, baby. but remember, robin, honey what we talked about. always got to work the mission.
scene direction: nikki robin looks down
nikki: look at me.
scene direction: nikki robin looks at nikki
nikki: you know i love you, but i got a job to do. the mission is what matters...right?
scene direction: nikki robin nods
nikki: that's my boy. come on.
scene direction: nikki stands and takes robin's hand. they walk away, but robin turns around and runs back to the scene of the fight to pick up the stake that spike dropped.
nikki: robin?
scene direction: nikki turns to look
scene direction: cut to 9 ext. alley in sunnydale - night
scene direction: adult robin wood turns to look over his shoulder, stake in hand. he's fighting vampires, as are buffy and spike, who are there with him. spike twirls a pole and stakes his opponent through the heart. buffy's fighting a vampire, but calls out to spike.
buffy: spike!
scene direction: buffy nods her head toward robin
scene direction: spike looks over at robin, who's fighting a vampire. the vampire is beating up on robin, but just as the vampire throws robin to the ground and stands over him growling, he turns to dust. as the dust settles, spike can be seen standing behind the vampire with a shovel in his hand.
spike: little tip, mate.
scene direction: spike offers robin a hand to help him stand
spike: stake's your friend. don't be afraid to use it.
scene direction: spike starts to walk away, but notices robin staring at him
spike: what?
scene direction: robin just shakes his head. zoom in on a stake in robin's closed fist—he's squeezing it so tight that blood is oozing out between his fingers.
scene direction: robin glaring at spike, mumbling under his breath
robin: just waiting for my moment.
scene direction: opening credits.
scene change: *** act i ***
scene direction: cut to 10 int. principal's office at sunnydale high - day
scene direction: robin is peeking out of his window through the levelor blinds, watching the students in the hallway. his hand is bandaged. buffy walks up to his door.
buffy: situation still normal.
scene direction: buffy shrugs
buffy: well, or as normal as this school ever sees.
scene direction: robin lets go of the blinds
robin: so it appears.
scene direction: robin turns
scene direction: buffy puts her purse down
buffy: well, no fires, no one's head's going kablooey. and the swing choir and the marching band have gone back to their normal, healthy seething resentment.
scene direction: robin smiles
robin: yeah, it's been pretty quiet around here since you shut down that seal.
scene direction: robin walks up to buffy
robin: you just may have stopped this thing, buffy.
buffy: no, it can't be that easy.
robin: you call that easy?
buffy: hey, any apocalypse i avert without dying? yeah, those are the easy ones.
scene direction: robin looks down
robin: you know, you're, uh...you're something else, miss summers.
scene direction: robin looks at buffy
robin: you know, i've been watching you when you're out patrolling, and you, um— you remind me of my, um...
buffy: your mother?
robin: yeah. yeah, what i remember of her, anyway.
buffy: got to tell you, not a line every girl likes to hear, but—in this case—
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: compliment taken. maybe you're right. maybe everything is fine.
scene direction: giles walks up to buffy
giles: everything's terrible. total catastrophe.
buffy: giles, what's wrong?
giles: have you seen the new library? there's nothing but computers. there's not a book to be seen. i—i don't know where to begin, buffy. i mean, who do we speak to?
robin: uh, that would—that would be me.
scene direction: robin offers his hand to giles
robin: hi. i'm robin wood.
giles: oh, sorry.
scene direction: giles shakes robin's hand
giles: rupert giles. sorry. buffy tells me you're something of a freelance demon fighter.
scene direction: giles robin points to his office door, then closes it
giles: oh, yes, yes. i, um, i'm relieved. we're running dangerously low on allies.
buffy: so, we didn't stop it, then?
scene direction: robin sits behind his desk, buffy sits on it.
scene direction: giles leans forward on robin's desk
giles: uh, no, the seers at the coven are certain the first is continuing to gather its forces. i'm afraid war is inevitable.
scene direction: giles stands
giles: so, we should go before the school board.
scene direction: robin confused
robin: what?
giles: well, i can have my backup library
scene direction: giles buffy rolls her eyes
giles: sent from home in the mean time. it's not much, but—
buffy: giles.
giles: knowledge comes from crafted bindings and pages, buffy, not ones and zeros.
buffy: so, did you bring back any potentials?
giles: um, no. actually, m-my, uh,
scene direction: giles takes off glasses to clean them
giles: my trip is about something else...regarding spike.
buffy: spike? what about him?
giles: i told you my concerns when you recklessly chose
scene direction: giles puts glasses on
giles: to remove the chip from his head.
robin: wait, sorry, chip?
giles: uh, it's a long story.
buffy: the military put a chip in spike's head so he couldn't hurt anyone.
giles: and that would be the abridged version.
buffy: but he wouldn't hurt anyone anymore because he has a soul now.
giles: unless the first triggers him again.
robin: triggers the chip?
buffy: no, the trigger's a post-hypnotic thing. the first put it in his head. it was—made him— he was killing again.
robin: so, he has a trigger, a soul, and a chip?
giles: not anymore.
scene direction: buffy angrily
buffy: it was killing him, giles.
robin: the trigger?
buffy: no, the chip. the trigger's not active anymore.
robin: because the military gave him a soul?
scene direction: robin buffy and giles glare at robin, who throws up his hands
robin: sorry.
giles: we don't know that the trigger is inactive.
scene direction: giles walks over to the window
giles: what i brought back may help us to disarm it, to ascertain exactly what it is that causes spike's behavior.
buffy: it was that song, giles. i'm telling you, it was that song that spike was singing.
giles: he has no memory of it. is there any part of it that you can remember?
buffy: it wasn't like it had a catchy hook or anything like "i'm coming up, so you better get this party started." it was boring, old, and english. just like you—ull. yule brenner.
scene direction: buffy giles crosses his arms and glares at buffy
buffy: a british yule brenner.
scene direction: robin to giles
robin: this thing you brought to keep spike from killing again... how's it work?
giles: well, it will require a bit of magic.
scene direction: cut to 11 int. basement at buffy's house - day
scene direction: xander is fastening shackles around spike's wrists.
scene direction: xander mumbling
xander: no, we couldn't have put these chains back up a week ago. nah, we gotta work on spike now, of all times.
spike: what?
scene direction: xander sighs, stands, looks around
xander: nothing.
scene direction: xander walks away
scene direction: pan around the room to show everyone's there - dawn, buffy, giles, robin, xander. they're all staring at spike, who's chained to the wall, sitting on his cot.
scene direction: spike to robin
spike: what are you doing here? you came to see the show?
robin: i thought you might need support.
spike: uh-huh. right, let's get this over with.
scene direction: spike to giles
spike: what're you gonna do? some hypno-beam? a disarming spell?
scene direction: giles walks up to spike, but keeps his distance
giles: not exactly. the first has brainwashed you. there's something in your subconscious that it's using to provoke a violent reaction. so...
scene direction: giles takes a small box out of his pocket, and takes a small rock out of the box
giles: we have to put this in your brain.
spike: bugger that!
scene direction: buffy's eyes grow wide with concern when she sees the stone, but she remains quiet, standing there with her arms crossed.
giles: the prokaryote stone will move within your mind to reveal the root of the trigger's power. can unleash ideas, images, memories... hopefully, once you understand what it is that's..
scene direction: giles rolls his eyes
giles: setting you off, you can break its hold on you.
dawn: hopefully? so, it might not work?
giles: the stone's just a catalyst for the process. the rest is up to spike.
spike: and how do expect to get that hunk of rubble into my cranium?
giles: willow?
scene direction: giles puts the stone in the box and holds it out toward willow
scene direction: willow walks in carrying a large book
willow: ok. i just hope my pronunciation is in the ballpark.
scene direction: willow reading
willow: "kun'ati belek sup'sion. bok'vata im kele'beshus. ek'vota mor'osh boota'ke."
scene direction: the stone starts to move like it's alive, no longer solid, but liquid. giles leans back away from the stone and holds the box up to spike.
scene direction: spike recoiling
spike: oh, you have got to be joking? what now?
giles: it has to access the cerebral cortex via the optic nerve.
spike: oh, bollocks. with all the rubbish people keep sticking in my head, it's a wonder that there's room for my brain.
scene direction: giles rolls his eyes
giles: i don't think it takes up that much space, do you?
scene direction: giles holds the box up to spike's face. the liquid stone crawls out of the box onto spike's cheek, then shimmies up into his eye, sliding under his eyelid. spike starts to squirm.
spike: ow. oh, ow!
scene direction: buffy runs to his side
buffy: spike! spike, listen to me.
spike: yeah.
buffy: are you all right?
spike: how am i supposed to know if this bug-ugly's doing its job—
scene direction: an orange light distracts spike and he looks into a far off place.
scene direction: cut to 12 int. victorian parlor - day
scene direction: spike's looking off into another world. a man is standing, reading to an old woman who sits on a chair in front of him needle pointing. the room's decorated with lots of knick-knacks around, the walls are covered with paintings, and there's a cozy fire in the fireplace. zoom in on the man to show it's spike when he was alive, when he was william. he's reading from hand-written pages, presenting his poetry.
william: yet her smell, it doth linger, painting pictures in my mind. / her eyes, balls of honey. angel's harps her laugh. / oh, lark. grant a sign if crook'd be cupid's shaft. / hark, the lark, her name it hath spake. / "cecily" it discharges from twixt its wee beak.
scene direction: mother proud
mother: oh, william...
william: it's just...scribbling.
mother: nonsense. it's magnificent. i wonder, though. this cecily of whom you write so often...
scene direction: william turns
william: oh.
mother: would that be the underwood's eldest girl?
scene direction: william shrugs, looks down
william: uh, no, uh, no. i do not presume.
mother: she's lovely. you shouldn't be alone. you need a woman in your life.
scene direction: william looks at the woman
william: i have a woman in my life.
mother: but you ne—
scene direction: mother giggles
mother: oh...
scene direction: mother giggles
william: well, do not mistake me.
scene direction: william takes off his reading glasses
william: i still have hopes that one day there will be an addition to this household, but i will always look after you, mother. this, i promise.
scene direction: the woman has a coughing fit, and covers her mouth with a handkerchief. william hands her a glass of water. she puts down the hand holding her handkerchief when she drinks the water held with her other hand, but william can see there's blood on the handkerchief.
william: should i send the coach for doctor gull?
scene direction: mother shakes her head
mother: i'll be all right. it's passed. just sit with me a while, will you?
william: of course.
scene direction: william sits on the floor, leaning on her knee as she goes back to her needle pointing and sings to him.
scene direction: mother singing
mother: early one morning, just as the sun was shining, i heard a maid sing in the valley below.
scene direction: "oh, don't deceive me. oh, never leave me. how could you use a poor maiden so?"
scene direction: william closes his eyes and listens to his mother sing.
scene direction: cut to 13 int. basement at buffy's house - day
scene direction: spike opens his eyes again, and they turn yellow as he vamps out in a rage. he grabs buffy's neck as she sits beside him and throws her across the room into the washer and dryer. he stands, growling, and lunges out toward the others standing there, but he's restrained by the chains. then he turns to the cot, picks it up, and throws it across the room. it knocks dawn down, and willow runs to her side.
willow: dawn!
scene direction: xander, giles, and robin step back as spike rages in their direction. buffy steps forward, but spike throws his head back and looks like he's having a mild seizure. the stone is coming out of his eye, slithers down his cheek, and falls to the floor, solid again. spike's back to human face, looking around as buffy and giles stare at him, trying to determine if he's still dangerous. spike pants as he recovers from the event. robin glares at spike.
scene change: fade to black.
scene change: *** act ii ***
scene direction: cut to 14 int. basement at buffy's house - day
scene direction: spike's squatting down on the floor, still chained to the wall. buffy, giles, and robin are the only ones still down there with him, and they're keeping their distance.
spike: get these sodding things off me. i'm fine.
scene direction: buffy arms crossed
buffy: don't you think you should take a little time, calm down?
spike: i am calm.
scene direction: spike to giles
spike: this stone of yours is—is out, right? did its job, so i'm de-triggered, right?
giles: spike, what do you remember about the song?
scene direction: spike nods, looks away
spike: oh, yeah, the song. it's called, uh, "early one morning." old folk ditty.
robin: what's it mean to you?
spike: mean? nothing. it's just, uh, my mum. it was her favorite. she used to sing it to me...
scene direction: spike smirks
spike: when i was a baby.
giles: and...?
spike: no "and." that's it. look, shouldn't you check on dawnie? i clocked the niblet pretty fierce.
buffy: she'll be ok. she's tough.
scene direction: cut to 15 int. living room at buffy's house - day
scene direction: willow's cleaning dawn's bruised forehead. willow and dawn are sitting on the couch, kennedy's sitting on the arm on the couch, just behind willow, and rona's standing beside kennedy. andrew, anya and xander are also in the room.
dawn: ow!
willow: i'm sorry.
scene direction: willow the phone rings, andrew goes to answer it
willow: doesn't look like anything's broken?
dawn: did you use some sort of a magic x-ray?
willow: no, that's just what people usually say.
scene direction: willow dawn pouts
kennedy: so, spike's trigger's been active this entire time?
rona: how can buffy take this for granted? i mean, he lives in our house, we train with him.
anya: don't waste your time down that road. spike's got some sort of "get out of jail free" card that doesn't apply to the rest of us. i mean, he could slaughter a hundred frat boys, and—
scene direction: anya everyone looks at anya disapprovingly; anya laughs it off
anya: forgiveness makes us human. blah-dee-blah-blah-blah.
scene direction: andrew holding the phone
andrew: uh, willow...call for you from l.a. somebody named fred. the guy sounds kind of effeminate.
scene direction: cut to 16 int. basement at buffy's house - day
scene direction: giles is still interrogating spike as buffy and robin look on.
giles: spike, listen to me. what is it about your mother?
spike: i don't know. i got along fine with her. she was a nice lady.
giles: well there has to be more than that.
scene direction: spike screaming
spike: well, there bloody well isn't!
scene direction: buffy walks toward spike, but giles stops her.
giles: what are you doing?
buffy: i'm going to unchain him.
giles: buffy, just—
scene direction: buffy whispering
buffy: this is pointless, giles. he doesn't know anything. your prophylactic stone didn't work.
scene direction: giles whispering
giles: because he's not cooperating. this process takes time. he's blocking whatever's flooding his consciousness. and what he does—he's endangering us all.
robin: so, the trigger's still working?
giles: much as ever.
scene direction: giles turns away in disgust
scene direction: spike fights against his chains. he looks at his hands, and a feminine hand clad in black lace slips into it.
scene direction: cut to 17 int. victorian parlor - night
scene direction: spike looks up into drusilla's eyes. he's back in the house where he was with his mother, but this time, william is dancing with drusilla.
drusilla: ooh, such a pretty house you have, sweet william. it smells of daffodils...and viscera.
william: don't get too attached, now.
scene direction: william twirls her
william: won't be here for long, luv.
scene direction: drusilla sits on the couch
drusilla: well then...
scene direction: drusilla pats the seat beside her
drusilla: should we give it a proper goodbye?
scene direction: drusilla growls seductively
scene direction: william walks toward her
william: you're a saucy one, aren't you?
scene direction: william sits beside her, kissing her passionately, grabs her up in his arms, and flings her across his lap, leaning in to kiss her again
william: dru...we'll bring this world to its knees.
drusilla: it's ripe and ready, my darling, waiting for us to devour its fruit.
william: we'll ravage this city together, my pet. lay waste to all of europe. the three of us will teach those snobs and elitists with their falderal just what—
drusilla: three?
william: you, me, and mother.
scene direction: william drusilla looks away, disappointed
william: we'll open up their veins and bathe in their blood as they scream our names across—
scene direction: william he notices dru's expression
william: what?
drusilla: you...you want to bring your mum wif us?
william: well, yeah. you'll like her.
scene direction: drusilla scoffs
drusilla: to eat, you mean?
scene direction: william's mother comes into the parlor wearing her nightclothes.
mother: william?
scene direction: william grabs drusilla's hand, they stand
william: uh, mother.
mother: where have you been? i've been beside myself for days.
william: you needn't have worried, mother. you'll never have to worry about anything again. something has happened. i've changed.
mother: i—i don't— who's this woman?
drusilla: i'm the other that gave birth to your son.
mother: i beg your pardon?
william: it's true, mother.
scene direction: william holds out his hand to drusilla, she takes his hand and walks forward
william: drusilla—she...she has made me what i am. i am no longer bound to this mortal coil. i have become a creature of the night. a vampire.
mother: are you drunk?
scene direction: william looks down
william: a little bit.
scene direction: william mother coughs, he walks forward
william: think of it. no more sickness. no more dying. you'll never age another day. let me do this for you.
mother: what are you talking about, a-and why are you acting so strangely?
william: it's all right, mother. it's only me.
scene direction: william hugs his mother
william: we'll be together forever.
mother: william...
scene direction: william vamps out
william: it only hurts for a moment.
scene direction: william bites his mother's neck
scene direction: cut to 18 int. basement at buffy's house - day
scene direction: willow walks down the stairs to the basement to talk to buffy.
willow: buffy? hey, i, uh, just got a phone call. i'm gonna have to take off for a while. maybe a day or two?
buffy: what's wrong?
willow: nothing you need to worry about. i'll give you the full scoop later. maybe i'll even bring back some good news?
buffy: could use a little of that. ok. i guess now is as good a time as we're likely to see for a while. just hurry back.
willow: will do.
scene direction: willow walks upstairs
scene direction: buffy walks toward spike.
giles: think about what you're doing.
buffy: i have.
scene direction: buffy unchains spike, then walks toward the stairs, with spike following her
giles: buffy...
scene direction: buffy continues walking without stopping
buffy: don't.
scene direction: buffy and spike walk upstairs, giles goes to follow, but robin stops him.
robin: mr. giles... you got a moment?
giles: what's on your mind?
robin: the same thing that's on yours.
scene direction: robin looks up the stairs
robin: we got ourselves a problem.
giles: spike.
scene direction: giles sighs
robin: yeah, if that trigger's still working, then the first must be waiting for just the right time to use it against us.
giles: it does seem doubtful the first simply forgot it had such a powerful weapon.
robin: yeah, a while back, it slipped up. it told andrew it wasn't time yet for spike. so, whatever the first's ultimate plan is, it's obvious that spike must play an integral part in that. something needs to be done.
scene direction: giles shakes his head
giles: buffy would never allow it.
scene direction: giles walks back downstairs to talk with robin
robin: buffy would listen to her watcher, wouldn't she?
giles: i don't think you have much of an idea of the watcher-slayer dynamic.
robin: as a matter of fact, i was raised by a watcher.
giles: you were?
robin: bernard crowley. took me in when i was a young kid, trained me.
giles: crowley. i remember the name. new york based watcher. resigned shortly after his slayer was—
scene direction: giles looks at robin carefully
giles: you're nikki wood's son.
scene direction: robin nods
robin: yes.
giles: spike killed your mother.
scene direction: robin looks away
robin: yes.
scene direction: giles looks down
giles: does buffy know this?
robin: she knows my mother was a slayer. she...doesn't know about spike.
scene direction: giles shrugs
giles: and this has nothing to do with personal vengeance?
robin: does it matter? he's an instrument of evil. now he's gonna prove to be our undoing in this fight, buffy's undoing, and she will never—never see it coming. now, i'm talking about what needs to be done... for the greater good, giles. and you know i'm right.
scene direction: giles sighs
giles: what exactly do you propose?
robin: i just need you to keep buffy away for a few hours.
scene direction: cut to 19 ext. cemetery - night
scene direction: giles and buffy are walking through the cemetery, talking.
buffy: i don't know, giles. is this really a primo time for a training session?
giles: i'm still your teacher, buffy. as adept as you are as a slayer, there are always new things to learn. now, more than ever, it's crucial to maintain focus on your calling.
buffy: in case you haven't noticed, our plates are kinda full right now. plus, i'm not really sure how i feel about leaving spike at robin's house to watch over him.
giles: for what its worth everyone at your house seemed...quite relieved at the arrangement. um, buffy, uh...while i'm not technically your watcher anymore, the fact that your life is such chaos only underscores the importance of the lessons i can impart to you.
buffy: fine. impart away.
giles: we're on the verge of war. it's time you looked at the big picture.
buffy: hello! all i do is look at the big picture. the other day, i gave an inspirational speech to the telephone repair man.
giles: it takes more than rousing speeches to lead, buffy. if you're going to be a general, you need to be able to make difficult decisions regardless of cost.
buffy: have you seen me with those girls?
scene direction: buffy paces
buffy: i mean, the way i've treated my friends and my family and... andrew. believe me, i know how to make hard decisions.
giles: well, that's what we're here to find out.
scene direction: giles a vampire reaches out of his grave
giles: while we work on the basics.
scene direction: cut to 20 ext. workshop at robin's place - night
scene direction: robin's unlocking the door to a shed.
spike: you live in the garage?
robin: this is just a work room. kind of my, uh, sanctuary.
scene direction: robin walks in, spike follows
spike: a little place to unwind, eh?
scene direction: cut to 21 int. workshop at robin's place - night
scene direction: robin and spike are inside the shed now, but it's completely dark.
spike: a hard day's prinipaling got you down, you need a place to cut loose, let your hair down—so to speak.
scene direction: robin flips on the lights in the shed to reveal that every square inch of the walls inside are covered with wooden crosses.
scene direction: spike looks around
spike: what the bloody hell is this?
robin: well, i told you. it's my, um, sanctuary. it's the hell mouth, spike. you can never be too careful. just, um, stay away from the walls, and you'll be all right.
scene direction: robin goes to his computer
spike: it's a bit much, isn't it?
scene direction: spike beat
spike: what's your story, wood?
robin: no story, really. just trying to do what's right. make a difference. how 'bout you? what kind of man are you, spike?
spike: sorry. not much for self reflection.
robin: yeah, makes sense.
scene direction: robin types on the computer, unbuttons his shirt
robin: see, you strike me as the kind of guy who just careens through life,
scene direction: robin takes off his shirt, reaches into a drawer near the computer to strap on fighting paraphernalia to his arms
robin: completely oblivious to the damage he's doing to everyone around him.
spike: that right?
robin: oh, i know more about you than you think, spike. see, i've been searching for you for a very, very long time.
scene direction: robin looks at spike
robin: ever since you killed my mother.
spike: i've killed a lot of people's mothers.
scene direction: robin turns back toward the desk to continue putting on his gear
robin: yeah. you'd remember mine. she was a slayer.
spike: so, that's it, innit? brought me here to kill me?
scene direction: robin turns to face spike
robin: no, i don't wanna kill you, spike. i wanna kill the monster who took my mother away from me.
scene direction: robin clicks the mouse on the computer; a song starts playing; the screen reads "early one morning."
recorded song: early one morning, just as the sun was rising, i hear a young maid sing in the valley below. "oh, don't deceive me. oh, never leave me. how could you use a poor maiden so?"
scene direction: spike tries to stifle his reaction, but the monster overtakes him. he goes into vampire facade and growls menacingly at robin.

scene direction: spike nods
spike: so we could be together forever. she said some nasty bits to me after i did that. been weighing on me for quite some time.
scene direction: spike points at robin

buffy: spike is here because i want him here. we need him. i'm in the fight of my life.
vampire: really?
buffy: not you, richard.
scene direction: buffy punches him
