scene direction: buffy runs onto a playground in the park being chased by two flesh colored demons, nasty twisted face, no mouths, you get it. she trips on the edge of the swing set and falls to the ground. one of the creatures looms over her. she snap kicks its leg knocking it into the pole of the swing set. she rolls to her feet. it turns to her. roundhouse to the face and it drops. she pulls out a knife.
buffy: you demons can't resist a run and stumble, can you?
scene direction: she throws the knife down at one of the creatures and it -- catches it. the other one grabs her from behind. she twists out and chucks it into the swing set pole. both demons get up, one right in front of the other and face off with her. the first ducks and the second throws her knife back at her. she catches it. the first demon rushes in to attack. swift kick to the stomach and buffy chucks in over her shoulder onto a picnic table. then a straight stab down into its heart with the knife. the second demon runs off as the first grumbles and dies. buffy yanks the knife back out and turns.
buffy: one down, one... gone.
scene direction: camera moves from shot of the retreating demon to buffy's hand, the back covered with a strange glowing substance. the substance fades into her skin unnoticed. camera moves over to the dead demon's body, showing that the glowy stuff is the demon's blood.
scene direction: credits roll.
scene change: *** act one ***
scene direction: opening shot of sunnydale high on a school day morning.
scene change: cut to willow and buffy walking into the library.
willow: so scabby demon got away?
buffy: scabby demon number two got away. scabby demon number one, big check in the slay column.
willow: i don't like this whole no mouth thing. it's disquieting.
buffy: well, no mouth means no teeth. unless they have them somewhere else...
scene direction: they sit down at the main table where xander and oz already are. giles comes out of his office nearby.
giles: here we go, we've been researching the, uh, mayor's forthcoming ascension.
oz: it's pretty riveting stuff.
buffy: what do we know?
xander: what don't we know. tell her giles.
giles: based upon the supposed date, graduation day, and the mayor being impervious to harm, i've cross-referenced- xander: he's a cross-referencing fool.
giles: and i've eliminated several possibilities. it's not the ritual flaying of the demon azarath nor the, uh ... i don't know what's going to happen.
oz: that was kind of an anti-climax.
buffy: we don't know anything? the whole fake angel thing was for nothing?
giles: no, no, no. if nothing else angel's charade has brought faith's treachery to the open and this information on the ascension will prove useful eventually, i just need to put it together. we see buffy scratching at her hand as wesley enters, looking dapper as ever.
wesley: terribly sorry, i was detained. official counsel business. mr. giles, you were speaking?
giles: i was just filling buffy in on my progress regarding the research on the ascension.
wesley: oh, and what took up the rest of the minute?
giles: touch√©. of course, my work is un- official. i'm sure, however, with the resources of the council at your disposal, you will have something to add.
wesley: well, i am pleased to state, with certainty, that the demon azarath will not in any way be involved...
scene direction: the whole gang, minus giles gets up and heads out of the library, leaving wesley standing at the head of the table.
wesley: i'm sure we'll find out more soon.
giles: demon azarath?
scene change: cut to buffy and willow in the school hallway at willow's locker.
willow: so have you talked to angel lately?
buffy: not really. seeing him bad, even pretend bad, and with faith...
willow: he only kissed her for the greater good.
buffy: i don't know. to the naked eye it looked like fun. or maybe it wasn't. maybe he wasn't even tempted. i just wish i could be sure.
willow: as always, i advise you to ask.
buffy: think he'd tell me?
student: hogan!
scene change: cut to percy walking towards willow and buffy with hogan, who, like percy is wearing a letterman's jacket. student goes up to hogan and shakes his hand.
student: great game man.
scene direction: xander joins buffy and willow.
xander: hogan martin thinks he's sooooo hot. like we should all be awed by him cuz he can put a ball in the net.
hogan: hey xander.
xander: he said my name! he knows my name!
percy: hey will.
scene direction: hogan and percy stop at the scooby gang.
willow: hi.
percy: um, look, i can't make the study session after school. ummmm, can we do it 5th period?
willow: ok. did you finish the reading?
percy: most of it.
scene direction: willow in school teacher, un-approving type voice
willow: percy.
percy: i'll finish it at lunch.
willow: that's my little trooper hogan: i don't know what you're doing to him. i actually heard him complete a sentence. it had a clause and everything.
percy: you're watching the game, right?
willow: wouldn't miss it!
xander: see ya hogan.
scene direction: the basketball guys leave. xander leaves too, heading down the hall the opposite way. buffy and willow walk together.
buffy: you're going to the game? i didn't know you liked basketball.
willow: i didn't either. but i really started getting into it. especially now that we're in the championship. it's so exciting. too bad you're patrolling, we're all going. oz, xander, everybody.
scene direction: willow turns and heads off to class.
buffy: great, everybody who isn't currently buffy.
scene direction: buffy scratches her hand again.
scene change: cut to the library office with giles. giles has his nose buried in a tome.
giles: you touched one of the demons?
scene direction: buffy examines her hand under a magnifying lamp.
buffy: a good touch, not a bad touch. anyway, it's been itching like crazy.
scene direction: buffy she switches off the lamp and swings it aside
buffy: no big, just another problem for the good people at lubriderm, right?
scene direction: giles finds a picture of the demon. he set the book down in front of buffy.
giles: that's the demon in question?
buffy: in the disgusting flesh.
giles: hmm.
scene direction: he picks the book back up and steps away from her, reading it.
buffy: what?
giles: it says they can infect the host.
buffy: infect? infect?
scene direction: giles is still reading.
buffy: giles! infect?!
giles: oh um, infect the host with an aspect of the demon. that's all it says.
buffy: an aspect of the demon?
scene direction: buffy grabs the book from him. looks at it intently.
giles: it's rather terse isn't it?
buffy: you mean like a part of it?
giles: there could be any number of explanations for your hand. a new fabric softener can cause irritation. in any case, i would advise not to attempt to track the one that got away. let's minimize your exposure.
buffy: part of the demon? i hope it's not the outside part.
scene change: cut to the outside quad. cordy and some other cheerleaders are leading a rally for the basketball team. the gang is sitting on a bench off to the side.
cheerleaders: h. o. g. a. n. it's hogan. goooo, hogan.
scene direction: everyone claps and cheers as hogan steps out.
buffy: is it me or is this really lame?
oz: i don't know. i usually enjoy lameness, and this is leaving me kinda cold.
scene direction: willow reading the school newspaper
willow: well, according to freddy's latest editorial, 'the pep rally is a place for pseudo-prostitutes to provoke men into a sexual frenzy which, when thwarted, results in pointless athletic competition.' xander: and the downside being?
willow: the school paper is edging on depressing lately. you guys notice that?
oz: i don't know. i always go straight to the obits.
scene direction: willow notices buffy running her hands over her hair.
willow: what are you doing buffy?
buffy: nothing... checking for horns.
scene direction: buffy hops off the bench away from them. willow quickly goes after her and they stop to talk a short distance away from oz and xander who still watch the rally.
willow: ah, you know, buffy, i don't even think giles is right about you becoming like a demon. i mean he's totally burnt. you know, dealing with faith and this ascension thing. between you and me, he's not doing his best work.
buffy: what if he is right? i'm suddenly going to grow this demon part and we don't even know what it is. it could be claws or scales...
scene direction: willow's expression turns shocked.
buffy: what?
willow: was it a boy demon?
scene change: cut to cheerleaders.
cheerleaders: t. o. m. it's tom. goooo tom.
scene change: cut to oz and xander on the bench.
xander: they really are very good!
oz: their spelling's improved.
xander: you know oz, i look at all this beauty, all these healthy young woman and i wonder why i ever wasted my time on cordelia. i mean, look at her. she's no better looking than the rest of them.
oz: none of them are really my-.
xander: oh my god, he's looking at her!
scene direction: xander sees wesley a distance away on the stairs, staring at cordelia in awe.
xander: he's got his filthy adult pierce brosny eyes all over my cordy.
scene direction: wesley shakes his head and continues up the stairs.
oz: you're a very complex man, aren't you? back to will and buffy...
buffy: it's just i'm scared will. there's this thing in me and i can't find it. i can't stop it. what if it changes me. not just the way i look. all of a sudden i could be something that's not me anymore.
cheerleaders: 7. 8. p. e. r. c. y. it's percy. gooo percy.
scene direction: willow looking away from buffy and at the cheerleaders
willow: yeah, woo-hoo!...sorry, they spelled percy, and, and, i have to show support-he's needy. but i heard what you were saying, really. and i would be frightened too, but i'm sure you're gonna be okay.
scene change: dissolve to buffy walking down the sidewalk at night. she stops and pulls out her compact mirror, takes a look.
buffy: still gotta mouth.
scene direction: she turns and is startled by angel standing right behind her.
angel: sorry.
buffy: it's okay. i didn't see you so i should have known you were there. what are you doing here?
angel: it's a dangerous time. you know, with faith.
buffy: yeah...faith. she...well... faith, what can ya say about her?
scene direction: they walk together.
angel: i just wanna make sure you're, you know, ok. that you're, safe.
scene direction: she stops and faces him.
buffy: and the fact that you're right here, does that mean faith's around? are you keeping me safe by tracking me, or are you tracking her?
angel: i'm tracking you. something's bothering you.
buffy: a lot of things.
scene direction: they start walking again.
buffy: the most recent being this demon. actually, two. i touched one of them and now i'm gonna get a big case of the bumpies, or a tail, or something.
angel: an aspect of the demon.
buffy: you know the drill.
angel: by rumor. that doesn't mean anything. i mean, sometimes demons, they just exagerate their power.
buffy: demon hype. maybe not. i spend all my time in the dark here anyway. it's not like i'd be at a gain you know with my friends where someone could see me and my new monster part.
scene direction: angel grabs her arm and pulls her around to face him.
angel: hey, i won't let anything happen to you if i can help it. no matter what, i'll always be with you. hey, i'll love you even if you're covered with slime.
buffy: i liked everything until that part.
scene change: cut to the school the next morning. willow, oz and xander are excitedly entering the lounge area.
willow: could you believe it? right at the buzzer. three points for the win.
scene direction: they all sit down.
oz: it was intense.
xander: yeah, for a minute there i thought you're gonna make an expression.
oz: well, i felt one coming on. i won't lie.
willow: man, i've never seen anyone jump like hogan martin. they should call him -- the jumper.
xander: or a name that isn't an article of women's clothing. hey, remember when- willow: shhh...
scene direction: xander shuts up as buffy approaches the group.
buffy: hmmm... quietness. we either lost, or we won and you don't want me to feel bad.
willow: well, yeah it wasn't a really good game.
xander: yeah tall hoops, with thin tall guys. what's the point?
scene direction: cordelia walks up to get something off a table nearby.
oz: pretty dull.
cordelia: are you guys crazy? that was an incredible game! i've never cheered so hard in my life. i still have knee marks on my back.
scene direction: cordelia off their looks
cordelia: from the pyramid.
willow: yeah, well, i still bet patrolling was way better cause, wow, important.
buffy: well i thought i saw a four legged demon. but it was just a dog.
oz: a weredog?
buffy: regular xander: tough luck.
scene direction: xander looks at cordy talking with her friends.
xander vo: i wonder if she and wesley have kissed.
buffy: it really bugs you huh?
xander: what?
buffy: cordelia and wesley, smooching.
xander: man, you read my mind.
scene direction: slow zoom in on buffy as she realizes what just happened.
scene change: *** act two ***
scene direction: buffy walks down the school hallway, in her own world. she bumps into a teacher.
mr. beech: ooo, whoa there. you watch where you're going now.
buffy: i'm sorry mr. beech, i will.
scene direction: mr. beech vo:  as he walks away
mr. beech vo: : students. if we could just get rid of all the students.
scene direction: buffy continues down the hall. students thoughts assail her.
geeky male student vo: when i'm a sophomore jillionaire and you're all flipping burgers. who's the loser then...
female student vo: 'maybe i'll take french, i said. how hard can it be, french babies learn it.' idiot!
student with baggy pants vo: i swear, someday my pants are gonna fall right off.
male student vo: buffy is so beautiful.
scene direction: she stops, gives a furtive glance at the guy.
male student vo: i mean, look at that body.
scene direction: she raises her arm to shield a blush.
male student vo: god, i would love to shove her against that locker right now and just oooh. she mentally freaks and hurries past. she almost bumps into another guy who looks at her. we don't hear his thought but she breaks into a run.
scene change: cut to buffy talking to giles in the library.
buffy: is this the thing? the aspect thing? because i gotta say, if it is, it is way better than a tail. i mean, i have a hard enough time finding jeans that fit right.
giles: buffy, slow down. i'm not even convinced that this is genuine mind reading. you're most likely projecting your- buffy: when i walked in a few minutes ago, you thought 'look at her shoes. if a fashion magazine told her to, she'd wear cats strapped to her feet.
giles: i...um...
giles vo: the demons are telepathic. i should have known. that's why they didn't need mouths.
giles: of course, demons are telepathic!
buffy: i know, you just told me. that's why they don't need mouths. and you should have known.
giles: this is astounding.
buffy: it was happening out in the hallway. principal snyder has walk like an egyption stuck in his head. and the boys at this school are seriously disturbed. it's wierd, but giles, think about it. think about what i could do.
giles: it could be very useful. you could anticipate your opponent's every move. turn his plans against him.
buffy: oh, way better than that.
scene change: cut to buffy in literature class.
buffy: jealousy!
scene direction: willow is seated to her right, with xander behind her. nancy, annoying miss-know-it-all is to buffy's left. the teacher walks around the room.
teacher: buffy. right. very good.
nancy vo: i knew that.
teacher: jealousy clearly is the tool that iago uses to undo othello. but what's his motivation? what reason does iago give for destroying his superior officer?
nancy vo: cassio has my place. twix my sheets, he's done my office.
buffy: well, he was passed over for promotion. cassio was picked instead and people were saying that othello slept with his wife.
willow vo: buffy did the reading? buffy understood the reading?
xander vo: when did she study? was i supposed to study? ms. murray's kinda hot.
nancy vo: i was gonna say cassio. uh, i hate her.
teacher: any other reason.
scene direction: nancy blurting out
nancy: race!
teacher: uh... good nancy. can't overlook that.
scene direction: boy sitting at willow's right is freddy.
freddy vo: look at them, scrambling for the teacher's praise like pigeons for thrown bread crust.
scene direction: buffy turns.
scene direction: buffy whispering
buffy: will, who's that guy.
willow: that's freddy iverson. he writes those editorials for the school paper. he's sardonic.
freddy vo: bread crusts. that's deep. i should write that down.
scene direction: buffy turns and looks back at the teacher, now at the front of the room.
teacher: there's something else at work here.
buffy: well, he, um, he sort of admits himself that his motive are... spurious! he, um, he does things because he, he enjoys them. it's like he's not, he's not really a person. he's a, the dark half of othello himself.
willow vo: huh...
xander vo: woah!
scene direction: the teacher steps out from behind her desk and approaches buffy.
teacher: buffy. really. very astute. i said something quite like that in my dissertation.
buffy: i know. uh, i mean... i agree. with that.
teacher: yes, and doesn't that also explain othello's readiness to believe iago.
scene direction: within seconds he turns on desdomona. camera moves in on buffy as the teacher speaks.
teacher: he believes that she's been unfaithful. and we're all like that. we all have our little internal iagos, that tell us our husbands or our girlfriends or whatever, don't really love us. but you never really see what's in someone's heart.
scene direction: the classroom scene fades to angel walking toward his draped over doorway. buffy opens the drapes. angel brings up his arm, shielding himself from the daylight.
buffy: oooh sorry. sorry about the daytime. i just ducked out of school and that's when they have it.
scene direction: they head into the main room.
buffy: um...you look good. i mean, i, i know i saw you last night, but sometimes things can change really quick.
scene direction: they sit down on the couch.
buffy: i mean really quick. listen to me. i'm talking like faith.
scene direction: his eyes snap to hers, then he looks down again.
buffy: you know, not that she was so bad to have around... you know, before the evil... you know, i think she was hurting a lot. and some people, protective type people, might be drawn to that i guess... well, the thing about faith-.
angel: you can't get into my mind.
buffy: how did you...why not?
angel: it's like the mirror. the thoughts are there, but they create no reflection in you. you got the aspect of the demon.
buffy: yeah, giles doesn't know how long it's gonna last. it's ok, a little headachy, but...
angel: you don't have to play games with me buffy. ever.
buffy: well, you're not exactly joe-here's- what-i'm-thinking.
angel: so ask me.
buffy: oh, but that woulda made sense.
angel: what do you wanna know about? faith? how i felt kissing her, pretending to have no soul? watching you suffer?
buffy: well, since you bring it up...
angel: i hated hurting you, more than i could stand.
buffy: look, the thing about faith, i'd understand. you know, she has, you know, that whole bad girl thing working for her.
angel: kissing her meant nothing. i don't want a bad girl. i've done that before. i've lived a long time buffy, and i'm past that. i've been with dozens of girls like her. more.
buffy: oh this honesty stuff is funnn.
angel: i mean, there's no comparison. in two-hundred-forty-three years, i've loved exactly one person.
buffy: ohh...it is me right?
angel: next time, just ask.
buffy: ok.
angel: and buffy, be careful with this gift. a lot of things that seem strong and good and powerful, they can be painful.
buffy: like say, immortality?
angel: exactly, i'm dying to get rid of that.
buffy: funny.
angel: i'm a funny guy.
scene change: cut to the library where willow, oz, xander, cordelia, buffy, giles and wesley are gathered around the table.
xander: she can read our minds? our every impulse and fantasy.
buffy: every one.
xander vo: oh god.
cordelia vo: i don't see what this has to do with me.
cordelia: i don't see what this has to do with me.
willow: well, i think it's great. right? i mean, you enjoy your other slayer powers.
buffy: yeah, and it'll be fun. did you see nancy doyle's face in english class today?
willow: yeah, she's super competitive, and you really showed her.
willow vo: she's hardly even human anymore. how can i be her friend now? she doesn't need me.
buffy: no! i do need you.
cordelia: ok, what are you talking about? because you are soooo creepy right now.
giles: um...i think there must be some precedence for occurrences such as this. uh, i'll research it. wesley, can you give me a hand?
wesley: of course. where do you think we should start?
oz vo: i am my thoughts. if they exist in her, buffy contains everything that is me and she becomes me. i cease to exist.
oz: hmm...
xander vo: what am i gonna do? i think about sex all the time! sex! help! 4 times 5 is thirty. 5 times 6 is 32. naked girls. naked women! naked buffy! oh stop me!
buffy: god xander! is that all you think about?
xander: actually... bye.
scene direction: xander runs from the library.
wesley: xander has just illustrated something. chances are, you're all going to be thinking whatever you least want buffy to hear. it's a question, of course, of mental discipline.
giles: he's right. there are...
wesley vo: look at cordelia. no! don't look at cordelia! she's a student! oh i am a bad man. i'm a bad, bad man!
scene direction: buffy gazes intently at him.
wesley: excuse me.
scene direction: wesley exits into giles' office.
willow: what's it like buffy?
buffy: i don't know. it's a little wierd. but... look, please, don't for a second think that i don't need you, because i do. i want to share this with you. it's like all these doors are opening to all these little worlds, and i can just walk right inside.
oz vo: no one else exists either. buffy is all of us. we think. therefore, she is.
willow vo: she knows so much. she knows what oz is thinking. i never know that. before long, she'll know him better than i do.
buffy: no, don't think that.
willow: i can't help it buffy. i'm sorry, i just can't.
scene direction: willow gets up and runs from the library.
oz: if you don't need me, i'm gonna follow the red-head.
scene direction: oz leaves also.
scene direction: buffy to giles and cordelia
buffy: guess i won't be writing that book, 'gaining friends through telepathy.' cordelia
scene direction: buffy vo
buffy:  whatever. i wonder when i can go.
cordelia: whatever. can i go?
scene direction: wesley sticks his head out of the office
wesley: excuse me. can you hear me thinking in here? i could go out into the hall.
buffy: you know what? you stay. i'm getting a headache. i'll go.
scene direction: buffy grabs her stuff and exits. dissolve from concerned giles to buffy walking down the crowded hallway. she hears numerous thoughts all run together.
thoughts vo: she is so hot! i hate my body. no one is ever gonna love me. what if i never get breasts? i can't believe the test is today. he has the cutest butt.
scene direction: she passes nancy.
nancy vo: hmph, i hate her.
scene change: cut to giles and wesley in giles' office.
giles: here. it's happened before. a man in ecuador. quite recently.
wesley: can we contact him?
giles: i'd say not. he can't communicate with anyone.
wesley: dead?
giles: no, he's in complete isolation. the power -- he can't shut it off.
scene change: cut to buffy standing along the serving line in the cafeteria. jonathon is next to her in line. the cacophony of thoughts continues.
thoughts vo: it's gotta get better. please tell me it gets better. i hate school.
jonathon vo: am i normal?
jonathon: are you through with the mashed potatoes?
scene direction: buffy looks at him.
jonathon vo: she doesn't even know i'm here. look at everybody, none of this matters.
scene direction: buffy steps away from him to walk into the cafeteria.
thoughts vo: come on! come on! she's a loser. she has the sweetest face i've ever seen. oh my god, quiet down. if i stand just in the right spot, i can probably see into the armhole of her top.
scene direction: all the voices blend into incomprehensible din as buffy walks through the center of the cafeteria with her tray. suddenly, the voices all stop.
evil voice vo: this time tomorrow, i'll kill you all!
scene change: *** act three ***
scene direction: buffy stands in the center of the cafeteria in lunchtime swing. everything silent. her tray slips from her hands. it smashes and silverware clanks as it hits the floor. everyone claps and laughs. the thought voices come pouring back. she runs over, grabs a student, looks at his face.
student vo: she's gone nuts.
scene direction: she turns and grabs another girl walking by.
girl vo: i hate being here.
scene direction: she grabs and looks at more people as the thoughts blare. she grabs and looks at jonathan.
jonathon vo: she touched me.
scene direction: she turns away from him, looking around at all the students. thoughts, thoughts, thoughts. she puts her hands to her ears, trying to block them out. the camera spins dizzily. buffy lets go of her ears and drops to the floor unconscious. black.
scene direction: fade up on willow, xander, cordy, giles and oz looking down at the camera, trees in the background above them.
willow vo: i think she's waking up now.
oz vo: she's ok.
giles vo: oh thank god!
xander vo: her eyes are opening.
cordelia vo: i'm cold.
giles: you alright?
cordelia: i told them not to move you. they probably severed your spinal cord.
buffy: i'm ok.
scene direction: buffy sits up.
giles: buffy...
scene direction: giles holds onto her.
buffy: no really. i'm ok. listen, there's a killer in the cafeteria.
xander: see, i've been saying for years that the lunch lady's gonna do us all in with that mulligan stew.
scene direction: cordelia hits him on the arm
cordelia: xander.
xander: i mean, what the hell's a mulligan?
buffy: someone was thinking about it. they thought 'this time tomorrow, i'll kill you all.' i have to find them.
scene direction: giles helps her up.
giles: well, did you, uh, recognize a voice?
buffy: no.
willow: boy or girl?
buffy: i don't know. i mean, it was hardly human. it was full of so much anger and pain.
scene direction: she starts to walk away from them. the cacophony of their thoughts intrudes.
thoughts vo: annoying.
scene direction: it builds and she stumbles back. giles keeps her from falling.
giles: buffy, count.
buffy: no, i have to find them.
xander: yeah, i mean, who hasn't just idly thought about taking out the whole place with a semi-automatic?
scene direction: everyone stares at xander.
xander: i said idly.
buffy: i know the difference. he... she... whoever, they meant it. they're gonna do it.
giles vo: she looks so tired.
willow vo: how horrible.
cordelia vo: i'm not getting any warmer.
xander vo: i bet it was hogan.
oz vo: who could it be?
scene direction: buffy grabbing her head
buffy: shut up!... uh, i'm sorry. i, it's just, can you guys not think so loud? or, so much...
giles: buffy, you should go home. i, i'll take you home.
buffy: yeah, ok, wha-no! look, i need you guys to go back to the cafeteria. make a list of everyone who's there. we have to find the killer before lunch tomorrow.
willow: we'll do it buffy. a list of all the students.
buffy: yeah. nancy was there. she's scary. and, uh, oh teachers too. mr. beech, he thought something about getting rid of all the students.
giles: come on.
scene direction: giles helps her away and the group walks the other way.
buffy: i can't shut it out giles. it's like this invasion of my head. it's like there's these strangers walking around in there. it's just a... look at this, i can't even be around people anymore. not that they're really clambering to be near me anyway. even you.
giles: i'm sorry buffy. it's hard for all of us. wesley and i are, are looking for a way to help.
buffy: i'll be okay right? i mean, even if you can't get rid of it?

willow: i think we have everyone that was in the cafeteria. i'll do some computer work. match it against the fbi mass- murderer profiles. see if maybe we can rule some people out.
xander: i'm still having trouble with the fact that one of us is just gonna gun everybody down for no reason.
cordelia: yeah, because that never happens in american high schools.
oz: it's bordering on trendy at this point.
willow: besides which, sunnydale high, center of evil and all that. let's get to work. we have till lunchtime tomorrow. we hope.

jonathon: uh... i guess.
willow: we all have fantasies that we're powerful, more respected. where people pay attention to us.
jonathon: uh... maybe.
willow: but sometimes the fantasy isn't enough, is it jonathan? sometimes we have to make it so people don't ignore us. make them pay attention. you know what i'm talking about, don't you?
jonathon: em, you... want me to pay attention?
scene direction: willow looks a little flustered.
scene change: cut to oz talking to hogan outside at the basketball hoop. he sinks a basket.
hogan: this is for the yearbook?
oz: yeah. personality profile.
hogan: can you ask it again?
oz: sure. do you ever feel that you've created a false persona for yourself, 'the guy who does everything right,' - and how much of a strain does it put on you to maintain it?
hogan: uh, wow, i guess... moderate strain. is that a good answer? i want to get this right.
oz: yeah, that's good.
scene change: cut to cordy walks up to mr. beech in his classroom as he erases the board.

scene direction: cordelia smiles
cordelia: oh, it's for the yearbook!
scene change: cut to xander, talking to three cute girls sitting on the stairway.
xander: okay, so turnoff's include smoking, insensitive men, and burkenstocks. now, your idea of a perfect evening? katie, let's start with you.
scene change: cut to oz entering the school yearbook/school paper office.
oz: uh, freddy?
scene direction: oz steps inside. he looks at the wall which has framed front pages of the sunnydale high sentinel. oz looks across the headlines. 'teachers fail competency exam', 'drop-outs find happiness' and 'apathy on the rise, no one cares'. oz turns and exits the room. the camera pans down to find freddy, hiding under the desk.
scene change: cut to buffy standing at her bedroom window. it's dark outside and she has the window open. the range on her power has grown.
thoughts vo: i should have just quit, no job is worth it. look at him smiling, like he thinks i don't know about her. i'm going to tell him we're going to have a baby, oh, i'm so happy! i can't believe we're getting away with this. one more drink then i'll...
scene direction: baby voice babble.
scene direction: buffy closes the window and climbs into bed. the thoughts blend into one long, rambling, incoherent stream. our heroine curls up under the covers and presses a pillow to her head.
scene change: cut to giles and wesley putting in late night research at the library. wesley is mixing some ingredients.
wesley: well, it seems to be coming along all right.
giles: yes, buffy's being driven mad, we have no proof that this is going to work, and it still requires the heart of the second demon, which we have no idea how to get without the slayer.
wesley: negative thinking doesn't solve problems.
giles: who is going to get the demon heart?
scene direction: giles to himself
giles: burke.
scene change: cut to the second demon flying through the air. it lands none-to-gently, smashing a picnic table. it hops back up and angel steps in to throw a punch which it dodges. the demon punches angel. angel shrugs it off, returns a punch, then steps in to throw the creature up onto a second picnic table (which doesn't give). the demon gets back to its feet as angel leaps up onto the table. angel gives it a solid punch that backflips it off the table. he jumps down. they wrestle for a moment and angel ends up twisting the demon's arm and throwing it into a jungle gym. he comes in to continue but the demon backhands him, the blow spins him to the ground. angel shakes his head, recovering from the blow. he looks up to see the demon running to escape. he gets up and pursues.
scene change: cut to buffy in bed the next morning. joyce sits, curled up with a blanket on a chair in buffy's room. buffy is asleep, but tossing and turning.

nancy: not until just now.
scene change: cut to xander sitting at a table by the soda machine with larry. larry is eating lunch.
larry: what? talk louder dude.
xander: i'm just saying, it's gotta be frustrating, having the secret. you gotta be kinda filling up with resentment, unexpressed rage, just waiting to burst out. today at lunch...?
scene direction: larry overly loud
larry: what secret? being gay? man, i'm out! i'm so out i got my grandma fixing me up with guys.
xander: that's uh, nice.
larry: but it sounds like, uh, you're having a rough time with it.
scene direction: xander gets uncomfortable.
larry: look, just do it. that weird freddy iverson guy that does the school paper- xander: he's gay?
larry: no dude, but i bet he'd put in like a coming out announcement for you. something tasteful.
scene change: cut to oz, goes up to the newspaper office door. it's locked. he knocks.
oz: freddy. we see freddy stop at a corner behind him. freddy turns and goes the other way.
scene change: cut to cordy, oz, willow and xander in the library.
willow: he's the only one we couldn't find?
oz: yeah. freddy iverson.
cordelia: the newspaper guy? but we can't figure out if it's him without the worksheet, right?
scene direction: xander holding up the newspaper
xander: we do have this people. today's editorial titled 'big game draws mindless brain dead mob' cordelia: does he mention the cheerleaders? because we were on.
scene change: cut to buffy tossing and turning in her bed. giles and joyce stand in the doorway to buffy's room.
joyce: i can't stand this. i keep wondering if i'm hurting her with my thoughts.
giles: you're not. not anymore. she can't pick one thought out of the... out of the din. a knock comes from downstairs. they turn and bolt for downstairs. wesley beats them to door below. he opens it and a smoking figure covered in a blanket steps inside. the figure pulls off the blanket and we see it's angel. he holds a vial of glowing blue liquid.
angel: i got it.
scene change: cut to upstairs. angel sets the potion on a burner. he sits down on the bed and pulls buffy up into his arms.
scene direction: buffy dazed, confused
buffy: uh, no.
angel: i'm gonna help you.
scene direction: he grabs the potion and feeds it to her. she struggles but can't really resist. she gulps some of it down. he sets the potion aside and lays her back on the pillow. she seems better. he kisses her forehead. she starts to freak, thrashing and kicking, not knowing what she's doing.
angel: giles! cut to the sunnydale high quad. with the 'something's up' background music playing. the camera pans around the students moving about. the scooby gang passes through frame. the camera moves and then tilts up so we see the clock tower. reverse to from the clocktower looking down at the quad. the camera pulls back into the darkness of the tower. we see johnathan step into view. he crouches down and opens a steel case. inside, the disassembled parts of a high-powered rifle. he grabs one of the pieces.
scene change: *** act four ***
scene direction: buffy's bedroom. angel kneels at her bedside, her hand clasped in his. her eyes open and she turns her head to look at him.
buffy: angel. buffy's mother sits down on the bed and we see giles and wesley in the room just behind her.
joyce: thank god! are you all right? do you hear thoughts?
buffy: no. did you find the killer?
scene change: cut to freddy sitting at his desk in the newspaper office. willow, oz, and cordy burst through the main door. freddy springs out of his chair to go out a side door but xander comes walking through that one.
freddy: ok oz, you got me.
scene direction: freddy holds up his hand defensively and sits back down
freddy: what are your friends gonna do? hold me down?
willow: you better believe it buster! you can't threaten a big murder without getting us pretty darn ticked!
freddy: murder? what murder? you're not here about the review?
oz: the review?
freddy: yeah. last thursday.
scene direction: freddy leafs through a paper on his desk, hands it to oz.
scene direction: oz reading
oz: dingoes ate my baby play their instruments as if they have plump polish sausages taped to their fingers.
freddy: sorry man.
scene direction: oz shrugs, sets down the paper
oz: no, it's fair.
freddy: i just get a lot of hate mail and i thought you were gonna come and deliver some personally.
xander: hey, if you find any tasteful announcement about me from larry-.
willow: xander, we have to figure this out.
cordelia: we have no shot. the killer could be anyone. we lose.
scene direction: buffy enters behind the gang.
buffy: we still have a few minutes.
willow: buffy!
xander: you're okay. can you hear thoughts?
scene direction: buffy shakes her head.
xander: just when i wasn't thinking about sex.
buffy: okay, here's the new plan. we're going to get snyder to evacuate the school. i just hope the killer's not waiting outside.
scene direction: cordelia reading from a letter off of freddy's desk
cordelia: by this time tomorrow, you'll all know what i've done. i'm sure you understand that i had to do it, and that although death is never easy, it's the only way.'
scene direction: cordelia beat
cordelia: god! doesn't anyone write in to praise the cheerleaders! we are so unsung.
scene direction: willow grabs the letter.
willow: jonathan! oh, i had him in my grasp. slippery weasel.

scene change: cut to xander runs into the cafeteria.
xander: jonathan! jonathan!
scene direction: he skids to a halt in the center of the caf. looks around. sees something.
xander: ooo, jello.
scene change: cut to jonathan lifts the front stock and barrel up to the rest of the gun assembly.
scene change: cut to cordelia hurries into the student lounge. she grabs one guy, looks at him. she moves over, grabs another one, looks straight at him. frustrated she turns to leave.
scene change: cut to jonathan snaps the front stock and barrel into place.
scene change: cut to buffy runs into the quad, looking at groups of students. she stops in the middle. she sees larry. she sees nancy. she turns and looks up, shielding her eyes from the sun. she sees him in the clocktower holding the rifle. buffy charges forward. she makes it to the base of the stairs. she hops onto the railing and runs up it. students make noise at the spectacle and nancy turns to see her. buffy leaps up toward the roof grabbing onto the edge. she swings herself forward in a ball, then back, up, and over she does a backflip forward to land on her feet on the rooftile.
nancy: i could have done that.
scene change: cut to jonathan puts a bullet in the chamber.
scene change: cut to buffy runs across the roof.
scene change: cut to jonathan slides the bolt home, the gun's ready to fire. buffy smashes through a boarded up tower window behind him landing in a crouch. he spins surprised and holds the rifle pointing at her.
jonathon: get away from me!
scene direction: buffy slowly stands up.
buffy: ok jonathan, you wanna point that somewhere else?
scene direction: he points the rifle slightly to the side.
jonathon: don't you try and stop me!
scene direction: buffy puts her hands up but takes a step forward
buffy: no, no no stopping. just here for view. hey, look, city hall.
scene direction: jonathon frazzled and sweating
jonathon: go away!

buffy: i just-.
scene direction: jonathon lurches back from her, aims the gun straight at her
jonathon: stop doing that!
buffy: doing what?
jonathon: stop saying my name like we're friends! we're not friends! you all think i'm an idiot! a short idiot!
scene direction: buffy matter-of-factly
buffy: i don't. i don't think about you much at all. nobody here really does. bugs you, doesn't it. you have all this pain, and all these feelings and nobody's really paying attention.
jonathon: you think i just want attention?
buffy: no. i think you're up in the clock tower with a high-powered rifle because you wanna blend in. believe it or not, jonathan, i understand about the pain.
jonathon: oh right. cuz the burden of being beautiful and athletic, that's a crippler.
buffy: you know what? i was wrong. you are an idiot. my life happens to, on occasion, suck beyond the telling of it. sometimes more than i can handle. and it's not just mine. every single person down there is ignoring your pain because they're too busy with their own.
scene direction: jonathan lowers the rifle more. buffy steps toward the window. she looks down at the quad below.
buffy: the beautiful ones. the popular ones. the guys that picks on you. everyone.
scene direction: jonathan slowly moves up behind her to see what she sees. he steps up right next to her.
buffy: if you could hear what they were feeling. the loneliness. the confusion. it looks quiet down there. it's not. it's deafening.
scene direction: she turns to face him.
buffy: you know, i could've taken that by now.
jonathon: i know.
scene direction: buffy holds her hand out
buffy: i'd rather do it this way.
scene direction: he thinks a moment, then hands her the rifle. she turns and pulls the bolt back, ejecting the bullet. she sets the gun down, then turns back to him.
jonathon: i just wanted it to stop.
buffy: yeah, well, mass-murder, not really doctor recommended for that type of pain. besides, prison, you know, it's a lot like high school, only instead of noogies-.
jonathon: what are you talking about?
buffy: actions having consequences. you know, stuff like that.
jonathon: i, i, i wouldn't ever hurt anybody.
scene direction: buffy has 'huh?' expression.
jonathon: i came up here to kill myself.
scene change: cut to xander wanders back into the cafeteria kitchen. he sees a whole tray full of jello in little bowls. he grabs one of them. he pulls the red jello block out, lifts it to his mouth. as he does he looks up and stops dead in his tracks. the obese lunch lady stands over a cooking pot pouring in a big ole box labeled 'rat poison'. she looks straight at xander. it's a mexican stare off. from her to him to her to him. xander drops the bowl and runs. the lunch lady drops the rat poison and grabs a butcher's knife.

buffy: okay, let's calm down.
lunch lady: vermin! you're all vermin. you come in here and you eat, and you eat. filth!
buffy: i don't see this being settled with logic.
scene direction: buffy pulls the lunch lady forward by her arm, then twists her wrist back. the butcher's knife flies across the room, rebounds off a wall, and clatters to the ground. the lunch lady takes a swing at buffy which buffy easily ducks. buffy double hooks the lunch lady hitting both times. the lunch lady lurches back. buffy finishes her with a reverse roundhouse. the large woman flies across the room, knocking over tables and a student. she's out. buffy turns to xander, still terrified on the floor.
scene change: dissolve to outside sunnydale high the next morning. willow and buffy walk up the first set of steps together.
willow: so you're feeling better about angel?
buffy: well, we talked, and then he ripped out the heart of a demon and fed it to me, and then we talked some more.
willow: see! that's how it should work!
scene direction: giles walks up to them.
giles: morning.
willow and buffy: hi, giles.
willow: oh! i should get to the yearbook office. i'm gonna give 'em the murderer profiles. they're really a good read.
scene direction: buffy waves bye.
giles: bye.
willow: cya.
scene direction: buffy and giles continue on together.
giles: how are you?
buffy: loving the quiet. nobody in here but me.
giles: jonathan? how's he?
buffy: pretty crappy. his parents are freaking. he got suspended. and toting a piece to school, not exactly winning him a place with the in-crowd. but, i think he's dealing.
giles: well, it's good of you to check on him.
buffy: well, it's nice to be able to help someone in a non-slaying capacity. except, he's starting to get that look, you know, like he's gonna ask me to prom.
giles: well, it would probably be good for his self-esteem, if you...
buffy: oh come on! what am i, saint buffy? he's like three feet tall!
giles: i'm glad to see you've recovered from your psychic encounter more or less intact. feel up to some training?
buffy: sure. we can work out after school. you know, if you're not too busy having sex with my mother!
scene direction: at which point giles walks right into a tree.
scene direction: black out
