buffy: sorry.
xander: 33 minutes. since when do we go through all this trouble for one lousy vampire. excuse me, one lousy potential vampire.
buffy: vampire by vampire. it's the only way i know how.

dawn: i think this thing has a freakin' child lock on it.
buffy: shh!
dawn: you know, i'm not the shortest one here. i don't know why i had to be in the kid coffin.
buffy: look, i know it's my job—
xander: no, no. i'm sorry. i wanna help. i guess i've been a bit stressed out lately. i'm sorry i took it out on you.
buffy: no big. been kinda stressed myself.
dawn: well, the whole willow sitch is not unstressifying.i mean she's here, but not "part of the gang" here and hopefully not "under my feet here in another time dimension" here.
buffy: there's willow. there's the looming humongo bad. and it's a school night. i should be home in bed, cuddled up to my insomnia, and worrying about how i'm gonna mess up tomorrow.
dawn: you'll be fine. you'll be a great counselor.
buffy: it's my first week actually talking to the kids. what if their problems are all weird and tricky?

buffy: the paper said she had unusual cuts and contusions on her neck.
scene direction: buffy shines the flashlight on the dead woman's neck, and right below her pearl necklace there are two puncture wounds that have been stitched up.
xander: maybe she cut herself shaving and then died naturally of embarrassment.
scene direction: buffy hands the flashlight to xander.
dawn: she looks...
buffy: peaceful.
scene direction: the woman in the casket opens her eyes, and they're yellow, like a vampire's.

scene direction: willow and xander are walking through a park, talking. willow's wearing black.
xander: i bet she's giving them great advice.
willow: absolutely! those kids are lucky to have buffy looking out for them. i just wish she believed it. she's still stressing over the whole "dropped out of college, not actually qualified" thing. plus the salivating hellmouth underneath her feet and the whole—
xander: from beneath you, it devours. it's not the friendliest jingle, is it? it's no "i like ike" or "milk: it does a body good."
willow: i know. it's gonna be bad. it's gonna be real bad. and i wonder, will i— well, if it comes— when it comes, will i be able to help?
xander: i think so.
willow: i don't know. i don't know what i can do. i mean, frankly, i'm—i'm scared of what i might do.
xander: yeah, i get that. figuring out how to control your magic seems a lot like hammering a nail.
scene direction: xander willow looks confused
xander: well, uh, hear me out. so you're hammering, right? ok, well at the end of the hammer, you have the power, but no control. it takes, like, two strokes to hit the nail in, or you could hit your thumb.
willow: ouch.
xander: so you choke up. control, but no power. it could take like ten strokes to knock the nail in. power, control. it's a tradeoff.
willow: that's actually not a bad analogy.
xander: thanks.
willow: except... i'm less worried about hitting my thumb, and more worried about going all black-eyed baddy and bewitching that hammer into cracking my friends' skulls open like coconuts.
xander: right. ouch.
willow: sorry.
scene direction: willow beat
willow: xander, being back here... i don't know...

tough boy: i'm scared. i don't want to be left all alone. my brother's joining up with the marines. whew. you know, if he knew i was making a fool of myself, he'd smack me in my head. i guess i'm just being stupid.
buffy: sounds like your brother's pretty tough.
tough boy: yeah, he's a man. i'm just all messed up right now.
buffy: you are not messed up. it is not messed up to worry about your brother.
tough boy: what if he doesn't come back? what if he gets blown up?
buffy: have you talked to him? have you told him how you feel?
tough boy: no. no, i don't wanna talk to him. i don't wanna do that. i don't wanna talk to him.
buffy: ok.: tough boy: you understand?
scene direction: cut to 16 int. buffy's cubicle at sunnydale high - day

buffy: so, josh, what's on your mind?
josh: well, i'm worried that i'm... gay.
buffy: ok, first of all, i... i think it's great that you would come and talk to me about this. and second of all, you should know that there is nothing shameful about being gay. nothing.
josh: i-i know. it's just—i'm not positive, so, uh, i was thinking that... why don't you go on, uh, a date with me so i can be sure.
scene direction: josh flashes his crooked-toothed smile at buffy while she shakes her head in disbelief and sighs.
scene direction: cut to 17 int. buffy's cubicle at sunnydale high - day
scene direction: buffy is counseling yet another student. she seems flustered with this student, holding her head in her hand before finally speaking.
buffy: it sounds like it's difficult for you. like maybe your sister makes it hard for you to establish your own identity. you said she's controlling, she doesn't let you make your own decisions—
scene direction: the student she's counseling turns out to be dawn, who's sporting an attitude.
dawn: yeah, and she borrows my clothes without asking.
buffy: i understand. that must be hard.
scene direction: cut to 18 int. buffy's cubicle at sunnydale high - day
scene direction: buffy's now counseling a girl who doesn't quite fit any stereotype. she's wearing a black t-shirt and purple streaks in her blonde hair.
buffy: so, you're not doing your homework.
cassie: i guess not. it all just... seems kind of ... whatever.
buffy: i know high school can seem kind of frustrating. but if you just get through it, then you can go to college, you know, or you can join the french foreign legion, or anything you want.
scene direction: cassie smiles
cassie: yeah, well, i'm not gonna do all that stuff.
buffy: ok, no foreign legion. i get that. i mean all the changing your name, and being indentured for all those years, and occupying algeria...
scene direction: cassie laughs
cassie: it's just that i'm not graduating from high school.
buffy: why not?

cassie: feel like what?
buffy: like you wanna hurt yourself.
cassie: oh, i'm—
scene direction: cassie laughs
cassie: i'm not gonna commit suicide if—if that's what you're saying. no way.
scene direction: buffy confused
buffy: ok then. then what are you saying?
cassie: look, i don't mean to be a pain. you seem really nice, and i know you're just trying to help. but i'm wasting your time.
buffy: no you're not. this is why i'm here. cassie, please tell me, why do you think you're gonna die?

buffy: what am i supposed to do?
principal: well, you did what you were supposed to do. you reported the situation to me.
buffy: and...
principal: listen, buffy, it's hard. kids this age... they're hurting, they're pissed off, and they say things. sometimes they say awful things.
scene direction: principal stands up, walks to coffee maker, pours coffee
principal: when i was in high school, i had a thing with this guy, right? real bully. i kept telling everyone that he'd better sleep with one eye open 'cause i was gonna bust his ass. well, i got suspended. talk like that is taken pretty seriously where i come from.
buffy: the hood?
scene direction: principal wood stops pouring his coffee and looks at buffy.
principal: beverly hills... which is a hood.
scene direction: buffy looks embarrassed. principal wood finishes preparing coffee, and walks toward buffy with a cup of coffee for each of them. he hands one mug to buffy.
principal: listen, the point is, i was talking big because i was scared. i couldn't bust a move back in high school, let alone someone's ass. most of the time, that's what it is when these students act out. fear, pain—
buffy: but sometimes, it's not just talk, right?
scene direction: principal walking back to sit at desk
principal: every time there's a threat like this, we do the same dance. inform teachers, search lockers, but we can't—we can't know what's gonna happen, and we can't search their brains. we just—we just do what we can.
buffy: it's not enough. i need to fix this. i don't usually get a heads up before somebody dies.
principal: what do you mean usually?
scene direction: buffy animated, talking with hands
buffy: no. no, not since—i mean, i'm sure it's not usual to get a chance to stop something like—i just i need to do something, ok?
scene direction: buffy walks toward principal's desk
buffy: i have to make this better—

cassie: a tattoo? oh, right. i could imagine that.
mike: come on. design something. i mean, maybe we could get matching tattoos. how 'bout like a snake with fire coming out of its mouth.
cassie: hmm. or a sexy hula girl who wiggles when you flex?
mike: yeah, now you're talking. sexy hula girl. but a sexy snake hula girl.
scene direction: dawn is pretending to read a book while casually making her way toward their conversation.
scene direction: cassie chuckles
cassie: you are so ridiculous.
mike: so, i was thinking... maybe we should go to that dance after all.
cassie: what do you mean "after all." i told you i don't wanna go.
mike: well, i assumed you were kidding.
cassie: it would probably be lame anyways.
scene direction: dawn's standing behind them now.
mike: well, yeah, but lame is funny… and, you know, maybe fun if, you know, we're hanging out together.
cassie: we hang out together all the time.
mike: right. and therefore we should hang out together at the winter formal.
scene direction: dawn walks up to them and interrupts.
scene direction: dawn to cassie
dawn: hey. um, i'm in ceramics class with you. i'm dawn summers. i forgot if we had an assignment last week. i spaced.

dawn: what do you have to read it for?
cassie: oh, just for me, i guess. i kinda stopped reading my homework assignments. i just... read what i want.
dawn: that's so cool. i'd do that, but my sister'd be down my neck in a second.
cassie: summers... hey— are you the counselor's little sister?

xander: so, the question is, what changed?
buffy: right. if she did have some sort of psychic vision, that would explain it.
willow: do you really think this girl is some kind of precog?
buffy: oh, i don't know. i told you about the shirt, right?
xander: buff, you spilled a cup of coffee. i'm not saying you don't have slayer grace, but it's not the first time.
willow: i mean maybe, just maybe, you're trying so hard to help that you're seeing paranormal when there's just normal.
buffy: maybe. but maybe not.
willow: want me to check her medical records?
buffy: her doctor already sent them.
scene direction: buffy hands the file to xander, who flips through it.

xander: a day and a half of researching, and we finally try looking up her.
scene direction: cassie's website is artsy and eccentric. the graphics resemble a collage of words cut from magazines pasted together.
buffy: wow, that's a lot of poems.
xander: poems. always a sign of pretentious inner turmoil.
scene direction: willow reading from the website

xander: this girl isn't just dealing, she's giving death a long, sloppy word-kiss. she has a yen for the big dirt-nap.
willow: i don't know. i mean, a lot of teens post some pretty angsty poetry on the web. i mean, i even posted a melodramatic love poem or two back in the day.
xander: love poems?
willow: i'm over you now, sweetie.
xander: love poems!
willow: look, all i'm saying is that this is normal teen stuff. you join chat rooms, you write poetry, you post doogie howser fan-fic. it's all normal, right? let's see what other sites there are.

buffy: uh, that's the guy that asked her to the dance?
dawn: right. the one that keeps asking her to the dance. i'm thinking, who likes to be rejected? nobody. i'm thinking, some people can't handle the rejection. i'm thinking that—
willow: hey, i got something. whoa, drunk and disorderly, disturbing the peace—there's a lot of charges here.
buffy: her dad's a drunk?
xander: a violent drunk?
buffy: we'd better find out. i have his address right... here. got your keys?

mr. newton: oh. oh, i see. that's-that's all. you just come in here in the middle of the night, into my home, and start accusing me of beating on my daughter? that's all?
buffy: we just want to make sure that cassie's—
scene direction: mr. newton slurring
mr. newton: well, that's a lie! who told you this? did cassie's mother put you up to this, 'cause i pay my support, ok? to the dime! she just wants to take away the one weekend a month i get to be with my girl.

xander: are you talking about killing yourself?
cassie: no, of course not.
buffy: then fight. try.

peter: this is our sacrifice.

buffy: do you know how lame this is? bored teenage boys trying to raise up a demon. sorry it didn't show. i bet it's 'cause you forgot the boom box playing some heavy metal thing, like blue clam cult. i think that's the key to the raising of lame demons.
scene direction: peter still on the floor, he looks over buffy's shoulder and points
peter: that lame demon?

peter: who are you?
spike: i'm a bad man.
scene direction: after knocking peter out, spike grabs the cleaver and holds it menacingly over peter while he stands. the demon has caught on fire from buffy's torching it. spike uses the cleaver gently to cut the ties on cassie's hands, then he takes off the duct tape on her mouth. the demon has burned to a crisp. cassie's crying, but calms down enough to tell spike something.

dawn: uh-uh. no. you didn't, 'cause you tried. you listened, and you tried. she died 'cause of her heart, not 'cause of you. she was my friend because of you. i guess sometimes you can't help.
