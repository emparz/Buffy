scene direction: willow and tara walking across campus.
tara: do you like cats?
willow: i'm more of a dog person myself. but i'm not like, "death to all cats." why?
tara: 'cause i was thinking of getting one.
willow: can you have one in the dorms?
tara: no, but this would be a sneaky cat.
willow: that would be cool. you mean it'd be sort of like a familiar?
tara: actually, i-i was thinking it would be sort of like a pet. you know, we could ... we could name her trixie, or miss kitty fantastico, or something.
willow: and we could make kitty go bonkers with string and catnip and stuff?
tara: absolutely.
willow: fun! i'm in.
tara: so, you're not allergic or anything.
willow: nope.
tara: good, cause ... i want my room to be willow-friendly.
willow: me too.
scene direction: they hold hands and keep walking.
tara: so i'm excited about the scooby meeting ... i think. what's it about?
willow: i'm not sure. probably just your garden-variety disaster.
buffy voice-over: zippo.

giles: well, i wish it were that innocuous, but with adam around, i feel he's involved somehow.
scene direction: giles is holding a bag of snacks. he pours snacks into a bowl.
scene direction: willow to tara
willow: when things get slow, it's usually because there's some extra evil brewing.
scene direction: tara nods.
riley: except the weird thing is, we've been busy at the initiative. our squads are pulling a lot more captures. we got demons coming out our ears.
scene direction: willow to tara
willow: that's a metaphor.

riley: you're kidding me. gotta say i'm surprised. i didn't think willow was that kind of girl.
buffy: what kind of girl?

buffy: oz is not dangerous. something happened to him that wasn't his fault. god, i never knew you were such a bigot.
scene direction: buffy starts to walk away
scene direction: riley stopping her
riley: whoa, hey, how did we get to bigot? i'm just saying it's a little weird to date someone who tries to eat you once a month.
buffy: yeah, well love isn't logical, riley. it's not like you can be mister joe sensible about it all the time.
scene direction: riley rolls his eyes.

scene direction: willow chuckles
willow: same old sunnydale.
oz: doesn't mean you haven't gone through a lot.
willow: it's true. some of it, you know, was me telling myself i hated you and cursing your name. not literally.
oz: well, thanks for that.
willow: and, i don't know, i - i think i'm getting better at my spells and stuff.
scene direction: they look at each other. willow fidgets, looks at the window.
willow: it's so light out.

willow: what?
oz: your friend came by. the blonde girl? but she wouldn't stay.
scene direction: he turns away to get his coat.
oz: so what do you think? where you wanna go?
scene direction: willow looks upset again. doesn't look like she heard the question.
scene change: cut to riley's bedroom. riley and buffy asleep. the alarm goes off and they wake up. riley stops it. buffy yawns.
scene direction: riley turns to buffy and rubs her stomach.
riley: morning.
buffy: morning.
scene direction: she sits up and pulls away, getting out of bed. she's wearing one of his shirts.
scene direction: riley watches her walk away. he gets out of bed and pulls on pants. stretches, starts doing push-ups.
scene direction: buffy comes back wearing pants. puts some clothes on the bed and watches him.
buffy: those like, regulation? do you have to do those every morning?
riley: no, just a good way to start the day.
scene direction: buffy has a bag. she's putting clothes into it.
buffy: great, then you can have your perfectly balanced breakfast, and then you can call your mother.
scene direction: riley stops push-ups. he did exactly ten.
riley: okay, i'm up less than a minute, and somehow i've managed to piss you off.
buffy: i should go home.
riley: no, come on. is it that whole thing about willow last night?
scene direction: riley sits on the bed
riley: look, i only said what i said because i'm concerned. i don't wanna see her get hurt.
buffy: you sounded like mr. initiative. demons bad, people good.
riley: something wrong with that theorem?
scene direction: buffy looks exasperated. she walks a few steps away.
buffy: there's different degrees of...
riley: evil?
buffy: it's just... different with different demons. there are creatures - vampires, for example - that aren't evil at all.
riley: name one.
scene direction: the door opens. it's forrest. he looks solemn.
forrest: rye, we need you downstairs. beta team got hit.
scene direction: riley stands up

buffy: hey.
willow: hey. you okay?
scene direction: buffy rubbing her neck
buffy: yeah, i just - i don't wanna talk about it. i wanna hear about you and oz. you saw him, right?
willow: i was with him all night.
scene direction: buffy raises her eyebrows.
buffy: all night?
scene direction: buffy grins
buffy: oh my god.
scene direction: buffy sits on willow's bed
buffy: wait. last night was a wolf moon, right?
willow: yup.
buffy: either you're about to tell me something incredibly kinky, or...
willow: no kink.
scene direction: willow smiling
willow: he didn't change, buffy. he said he was gonna find a cure, and he did. in tibet.
scene direction: buffy smiling
buffy: oh my god. i can't believe it.
scene direction: buffy pauses
buffy: okay, i'm all with the woo-hoo here, and you're not.
willow: no, there's "woo" and, and "hoo." but there's "uh-oh," and... "why now?" and... it's complicated.
buffy: why complicated?
scene direction: willow sighs, steels herself
willow: it's complicated... because of tara.
scene direction: buffy frowns
buffy: you mean tara has a crush on oz? no.
scene direction: the clue-by-four hits buffy.
buffy: oh!
scene direction: willow gives a nervous smile.
scene direction: buffy stands up.
buffy: oh. um... well... that's great. you know, i mean, i think tara's a-a really great girl, will.
willow: she is. and... there's something between us. it-it wasn't something i was looking for. it's just powerful. and it's totally different from what oz and i have.
buffy: well, there you go, i mean, you know, you have to - you have to follow your heart, will. and that's what's important, will.
willow: why do you keep saying my name like that?
scene direction: buffy with false cheer
buffy: like what, will?
scene direction: willow sits up
willow: are you freaked?
buffy: what? no, will, d-
scene direction: buffy stops herself, sighs
buffy: no.
scene direction: buffy sits on bed
buffy: no, absolutely no to that question.
scene direction: willow looks skeptical.
buffy: i'm glad you told me. what did you say to oz?
willow: i was gonna tell him ... but then we started hanging out, and ... i could just feel everything coming back.
scene direction: buffy looks sympathetic.
willow: he's oz, you know?
buffy: yeah. i know.
willow: i don't wanna hurt anyone, buffy.
buffy: no matter what, somebody's gonna get hurt. and the important thing is, you just have to be honest, or it's gonna be a lot worse.
scene direction: willow nods.
scene change: cut to the tombs. spike lying on top of a coffin, covered with a blanket. footsteps slowly approaching. a greenish hand reaches for spike's throat but he grabs it.
scene direction: spike not opening his eyes
spike: from the sound of those massive mud flaps, i'd peg you as a demon. which means you're in for a world of...
scene direction: spike opens his eyes and sees adam
spike: pain.
scene direction: spike gets to his feet.
adam: spike, i want you to come with me.
spike: do you?
scene direction: spike shrugs
spike: well, let's go then.
scene direction: spike turns as if to leave, then spins around and punches adam in the stomach. no effect. spike shakes his hand in pain
spike: ow.
adam: come.
scene direction: adam steps forward; spike steps back
adam: you're going to help me with my problem.
spike: why is that exactly?

scene direction: tara opens her dorm room door. willow is standing there.
willow: hi.
tara: hi.
scene direction: tara stands back so willow can come in, then tara closes the door.
willow: i can only stay for a minute. i have class.
tara: me too, i-i-i have class too.
willow: i just want you to know that what you saw this morning, it wasn't...
tara: no, it's okay. i-i always knew that if he came back...
willow: we were just talking. nothing happened.
scene direction: tara hopeful smile
tara: oh.
scene direction: tara pauses
tara: really?
scene direction: willow nods.
willow: but, you know, it was intense. just talking. we have a lot to talk about.
scene direction: willow frowns
willow: i kinda feel like my head's gonna explode.
scene direction: tara struggles for a moment
tara: whatever, you know, happens ... i'll still be here. i'll still be your friend.
willow: of course we'll be friends! that's not even a question.
scene direction: tara upset
tara: but i'm saying, i know what oz means to you.
willow: how can you, when i'm not even sure? i mean, i know what he meant to me. but he left, and... everything changed. i changed, and... then we...
tara: what?
scene direction: willow teary
willow: i don't know. i just - life was starting to get so good again, and --
scene direction: willow sighs, moves closer to tara
willow: you're a big part of that.
scene direction: willow crying
willow: and here comes the thing i wanted most of all, and... i don't know what to do, i ... i wanna know, but i don't.
scene direction: tara looks sympathetic. she brushes the tears off willow's cheek.
tara: do what makes you ... h-h-happy.
scene direction: willow hugs her. tara strokes willow's hair.
scene change: cut to inside one of the college buildings. oz is looking at a wall covered with flyers and posters. he wrinkles his nose and calls "willow!" just as tara walks by. she stops and looks at him. oz looks confused. he walks toward tara.
oz: hey. i thought i sm...ah, heard willow.
scene direction: tara looks nervous, clutching books to her chest.
tara: hey.
scene direction: tara notices oz holding books
tara: you're um, you're coming back to school here, huh?
oz: pretty much. feeling ... oddly motivated.
scene direction: oz still sniffs the air and looks around, confused
tara: that's um, that's great. i mean, that's, that's great for you and willow, right?
oz: i hope so.
scene direction: tara nervous
tara: good, that's, because...
oz: is that her sweater?
scene direction: tara looks down
tara: i just, i just hope that you guys'll be very ... happy.
scene direction: oz moves closer
oz: you smell like her.
scene direction: tara still doesn't look at him.
oz: she's all over you, do you know that?
scene direction: oz getting angry
tara: i can't. i-i can't talk about this.
scene direction: tara tries to walk away. oz grabs her arm
oz: but there's something to talk about?
scene direction: oz angrier
scene direction: tara just gasps and stares at him.
oz: are you two involved?!
tara: i have, i, i, i have to go.
oz: 'cause she never said anything to me like that. we talked all night and she never...
scene direction: tara starts to walk away.
oz: no, stop!
scene direction: oz grabs her again. tara looks scared
scene direction: oz yelling
oz: is she in love with you? tell me, is she?!
scene direction: oz shakes her by the shoulders. then he lets her go. he's panting. they look down at his hand and it grows fur and claws. tara looks really scared
scene direction: oz looks up. his face is half-wolfed and his eyes are black.
oz: run.
scene change: *** commercial ***
scene direction: tara runs through the hallways, not carrying books anymore. the werewolf chases her. she runs into a classroom, up the tiers of chairs, tries to get out the back door but it's locked. the werewolf chases her up the stairs, then back down. she tries to get away but he corners her. tara screams and throws a chair at him. he collapses and doesn't move. tara stands there panting. we see a tranquilizer dart sticking out of the werewolf.
scene direction: riley and forrest and a bunch of other initiative guys come in. riley is putting away the tranquilizer gun.
forrest: are you okay?
tara: what's going on?
forrest: we'll take it from here.
scene direction: riley and the others are putting oz in a bag.
commando 2: this thing looks like it may be one of the demons that took out graham's guys the other night.
riley: we'll take it back. we'll make an id. if it is, we'll put him down.
tara: you don't understand, that's -
scene direction: tara stuttering
forrest: listen, we know what we're doing. you're in shock.
tara: but...
forrest: we'll handle it.
scene direction: forrest walks away
tara: no.
scene change: cut to adam's underground lair.
spike: well, that sounds like a lot of fun.
adam: you see my problem, though. total annihilation of the humans doesn't help me. i'll be needing heavy casualties on both sides.
spike: i get that. i'm still not sure how the slayer fits in.
adam: the humans need a leader... a champion. the slayer can do that.
scene direction: spike skeptical
spike: yeah... the thing about the slayer is... she is a whiny little thing, but when it comes to the fighting, she does have a slight tendency to win.
adam: then i guess you should be on her side.
scene direction: spike smiles tolerantly.
spike: this all goes down, the chip comes out, yeah? no tricks.
adam: scout's honor.
spike: *you* were a boy scout?
adam: parts of me.
scene change: cut to willow in the school library, pretending to read. tara rushes in.
scene direction: willow sees her and gets up.
willow: what's up? you okay?
tara: oz. we were talking and, he changed. right in front of me.
willow: what? it's daylight.
tara: i know, but it happened.
willow: oh my god, are you all right?
tara: i'm fine. riley and the commando guys, they stopped him. but they don't know it's oz. i tried to tell them, but ... they took him away.
willow: when? just now?
scene direction: tara nods.
tara: i think they might hurt him.
willow: i, i have to go, i have to find buffy.
tara: i know.
scene direction: willow runs off. tara looks upset.
scene change: cut to giles' place. xander and anya on the sofa. giles behind it. willow pacing. buffy in the background, on the phone.
willow: tara said they took him right before she found me.
anya: so that's good, right? i mean, they probably haven't had time to eviscerate him yet.
scene direction: willow sits on sofa.
xander: an, you can help by making this a quiet time.
giles: once again we're faced with a fairly daunting prospect of having to infiltrate the initiative.
xander: it'd be great if we knew someone dating a man on the inside. someone with connections.
scene direction: buffy hangs up phone and comes around to the sofa.
xander: oh, wait!
scene direction: xander gestures at buffy
buffy: he's still not answering his pages. i left him another message.
willow: so what do we do?
buffy: well, we need to move fast. so we make a plan without riley...
scene direction: shot of giles looking concerned.
buffy: ...and hope he calls.
scene change: cut to underground at the initiative. oz-wolf is in a cage, growling and trying to get out. riley, forrest, soldiers with guns, and scientists in white coats are watching. another scientist approaches.
forrest: what's the word, doc? is this the animal that took apart our men?
doc #1: we don't know yet, soldier.
riley: what's the holdup? i thought graham gave you a full description.
doc #1: the holdup is that he described characteristics present in over 40 known varieties of demon. so we're cross-checking dna evidence - hair, fibers...
scene direction: riley impatient
riley: and how long is that gonna take?
scene direction: doc #1 annoyed
doc #1: i have no idea.
riley: i don't need a bunch of tests to know that this thing's a killer.
scene direction: takes out his gun and points it at oz. suddenly oz stops growling and morphs back into his human self. riley lowers his gun and steps back.
scene direction: everyone looks surprised. oz looks up at them panting and closing his eyes.
scene change: fade to white screen.
scene change: fade to oz's perspective, lying on a table with two docs over him and many more in the background. doc #1 is on the left, shining a flashlight in his eyes. riley is behind him.
scene direction: shot of oz on the table, naked and looking groggy.
scene direction: riley pushes forward.
riley: hey, he's coming to. oz!
doc #1: he won't be able to talk for a while. we gave him haldol to keep him quiet.
scene direction: doc #1 shining flashlight on oz's teeth
riley: why? he's not a threat now.
doc #1: i allowed you to stay as long as you let us do our work, agent finn. only colonel mcnamara can place a cease order on medical testing, and he's told us to proceed.
doc #2: i always suspected that stuff about werewolf transformations being based on a lunar cycle was campfire talk.
scene direction: doc #2 injects oz with something. oz groans
scene direction: riley sees the second doctor pulling out another instrument.
riley: oh, hey, that's enough. come on, the guy's a student, i know him.
scene direction: doc #1 points to the other soldiers
doc #1: take him out.
commando #3: yes sir.
scene direction: riley looks angry, but lets the other soldiers escort him away.
scene direction: doc #2 puts the tip of the instrument on oz's chest and zaps him with electricity. oz screams and turns into the werewolf.
doc #2: see that? transformation related to negative stimulation.
scene direction: the docs exchange a look.
scene change: cut to giles' house.
buffy: something's wrong. riley usually returns my phone calls by now.
xander: we can't wait much longer.

scene direction: buffy looks at willow
buffy: okay. xander, you and i are gonna go in. we've done it before.
willow: i'm going with you.
buffy: no. look, it's too dangerous, will. besides, i need you to help giles hack into the city's electrical grid. we've gotta try to power down the initiative.
willow: giles can do it without me. i can give him all the instructions, i can show him exactly what to do.
giles: of course.
willow: i-i can't just sit here.
scene direction: buffy looks at xander.
buffy: okay. okay, you can back us up.
scene direction: buffy sighs

xander: so we grab a guy, make him take us.
spike: or you could just use the back way.
scene direction: everyone turns to see spike standing by the closed door.
spike: hell of a lot less bother.
giles: how did you get in?
spike: door was unlocked. you might wanna watch that, rupert. someone dangerous could get in.
buffy: or someone formerly dangerous and currently annoying.
scene direction: spike extremely amused and pleased with himself
spike: now, now. none of that. or i won't help you get red's mongrel back.
scene direction: everyone looks surprised.
spike: bad news travels fast with us demons. we all like a good laugh.
scene direction: spike chuckles
giles: short of cash, spike?
spike: i happen to be seeking monetary gratification, yeah. but i also get a kick out of jackin' up those army ginks myself. i know how to find the big guy who can take you to oz.
buffy: uh-huh. so what's the going rate on a wild goose chase, spike?
spike: fine, if you're not interested. but i was stuck in that hole, remember? and i've heard things from other guys who've gotten out. i can get you in. no alarms, no cameras ... no waiting.
scene direction: everyone looks at buffy.

colonel: denied.
scene direction: riley looks surprised.
colonel: being new around here, finn, i had a look at your record and professor walsh's notes. until recently, you were an exemplary soldier headed straight for the top. then you meet this girl, this ... slayer, and suddenly you begin to exhibit signs of disloyalty. you abuse your command. but tonight...
scene direction: colonel shakes his head, squints
colonel: to release a lethal hst back into the population...
scene direction: riley shakes his head.
riley: sir, the prisoner...
colonel: you will speak when i tell you to!
scene direction: riley goes back to attention.
colonel: tomorrow i am going to institute a court-martial to investigate the extent of your involvement with the slayer and her band of freaks.
scene direction: colonel pauses
colonel: they're anarchists, finn ... too backwards for the real world. you help us take them down, and you just might save your military career. otherwise, you'll go to your grave labeled a traitor.
scene direction: riley looks shocked. the colonel turns and leaves.

scene direction: colonel looks from her to xander, to spike and willow in the doorway
colonel: yeah.
buffy: then you know i'm pretty good with this thing. take us to him.

scene direction: buffy looks surprised.
colonel: you're only gonna make matters worse.

scene change: cut to the old sunnydale high ruins. buffy and riley are setting up a campsite. they have coolers and a camp lantern. riley spreads a sleeping bag on the ground. buffy is pouring from a thermos.
buffy: i hope everybody else is okay. it was better to split up, right? i mean, we're just too findable in a big clump.
riley: it was better. besides, i think it's mostly me the initiative wants now.
scene direction: he sits on the sleeping bag and sighs.
buffy: probably. so what should we do?
scene direction: riley puts his head in his hands
riley: we'll be safe for tonight at least. the campus is still blacked out, so that oughta slow the initiative down. i'll
scene direction: riley gestures vaguely
riley: figure out my next move tomorrow.
scene direction: buffy sighs.
buffy: quite a day, huh?
scene direction: riley nods.

scene direction: buffy comes over to sit next to him
riley: i don't know. i'm sorry it ended that way. but i am glad it's done. i'm glad i know where i stand, finally.
scene direction: buffy looks pensive.
riley: i was wrong about oz. i *was* being a bigot.
scene direction: buffy shakes her head.
buffy: no you weren't. you were thrown. you found out that willow was in... kind of an unconventional relationship, and it gave you a momentary wiggins. it happens.
riley: still... i was in a totally black and white space, people versus monsters, and it ain't like that... especially when it comes to love.
scene direction: buffy looks up. she comes to a decision.
buffy: i have to tell you some stuff... about my past. and it's not all stuff that you're gonna like.
scene direction: riley looks a little nervous. he can tell this is important.
riley: you can tell me anything.
buffy: i think so.
scene direction: buffy smiles
buffy: i think i can.
scene change: cut to oz and willow sitting in oz's van.
willow: this thing looks pretty good, considering you drove it overseas.
scene direction: oz doesn't look at her.
oz: well, it broke down outside of mexico, and i traded my bass to have it fixed and garaged.
scene direction: pause.
oz: i shouldn't have come back now... i just thought i'd changed.
willow: you have changed.
scene direction: willow smiles
willow: you stopped the wolf from coming out. i saw it.
oz: but i couldn't look at you.
scene direction: oz still can't
oz: i mean, it turns out... the one thing that brings it out in me is you... which falls under the heading of ironic in my book.
willow: it was my fault. i upset you.
scene direction: he finally looks at her.
oz: well, so we're safe then,
scene direction: oz sarcastic
oz: 'cause you'll never do that again.
scene direction: willow tries to look amused.
oz: but... you're happy?
scene direction: willow smiles
willow: i am. i can't explain it...
oz: it may be safer for both of us if you don't.
scene direction: willow looks sad.
willow: i missed you, oz. i wrote you so many letters... but i didn't have any place to send them, you know?
scene direction: pause.
willow: i couldn't live like that.
oz: it was stupid to think that you'd just be... waiting.
willow: i was waiting. i feel like some part of me will always be waiting for you. like if i'm old and blue-haired, and i turn the corner in istanbul and there you are, i won't be surprised. because... you're with me, you know?
oz: i know.
scene direction: oz pauses
oz: but now is not that time, i guess.
scene direction: willow shakes her head
willow: no.
scene direction: they look at each other.
willow: what are you gonna do?
oz: i think i better take off.
willow: when?
oz: pretty much now.

scene change: cut to tara in her darkened dorm room, looking out the window. there's a knock on the door. she gets up to answer it. it's willow, holding a candle.
willow: no candles? well, i brought one. it's extra flamey.

willow: tara, i have to tell you...
tara: no, i-i understand. you have to be with the person you l-love.
scene direction: willow smiles
willow: i am.
scene direction: tara looks amazed.
tara: you mean...
willow: i mean.
scene direction: willow pause
willow: okay?
tara: oh, yes.
willow: i feel horrible about everything i put you through. a-and i'm gonna make it up to you. starting right now.
scene direction: tara starts to smile
tara: right now?
scene direction: willow smiles and nods. tara blows out the candle.
scene direction: end.
